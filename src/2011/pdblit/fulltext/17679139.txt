Cytochrome P450
Thomas L Poulos
U n i v e r s i t y of California at Irvine, Irvine, U S A Since 1993, three new cytochrome P450 X-ray structures have been determined, giving a total of four known structures. Two of the new structures are in the substrate-free form and one is substrate-bound. These new structures, together with a wealth of mutagenesis studies on various P450s, have provided considerable information on what structural features control substrate specificity in P450s. In addition, some important insights into the catalytic mechanism have been made. Current Opinion in Structural Biology 1995, 5:767-774

the O - O bond to yield a reactive iron-oxo intermediate is generally regarded to be the same in all P450s. This review will focus on what new P450 crystal structures have taught us about those structural features that control substrate binding and the oxygen-cleavage reaction.

First, the substrate, R.H, binds over the surface o f the single heme group directly adjacent to the O2-binding site (step 1). Next, the heme iron is reduced from the ferric (Fe 3+) to the ferrous (Fe 2+) state (step 2), and 0 2 binds to the heine iron (step 3). Finally a second electron is transferred to the P450, resulting in O - O bond cleavage and substrate hydroxylation (step 4). Electrons are delivered to the P450 by a reductase which catalyses the oxidation o f either N A D P H or N A D H with the subsequent delivery o f electrons from the flavin-containing reductase to the P450. In bacteria and mitochondria, a soluble iron-sulphur protein shuttles electrons between the reductase and P450. In general, P450s that are involved in catabolism tend to exhibit broader specificities than those involved in the formation of important metabolic intermediates. The wide range o f substrates used by various P450s dictates that the substrate-binding pockets m P450s exhibit a wide range of sizes, shapes and flexibility. Even so, the basic heine-oxygen chemistry required to cleave

For a number of years the only available crystal structure o f a P450 was that of P450ca m (reviewed in [1]). Since 1993, however, three additional P450 structures have been solved [2,3"'-5"']. Figure 1 shows the substrates for the four P450s and a schematic representation of one of the P450 structures. P45OI3M_3 is a fatty acid hydroxylase from Badllus megaterium, and is an unusual prokaryotic P450 because the P450 is fused to its reductase, giving a 119kDa polypeptide that contains a heine and two flavins [6]. For crystal-structure work, the heme domain has been recombinantly expressed as a separate domain comprising residues 1-455 or 1-471. More recently, it has become clear that the architecture of holo P450BM_3, containing both the fused heine and reductase domains, is quite similar to that of nitric oxide synthase [7]. P450terp is similar in structure to P450ca m and is also derived from a Pseudomonad. P450ery F is obtained from the actinomycete Saccaropolysporaerythraea, m which it participates in erythromycin biosynthesis [8]. The macrolide substrate 6-deoxTerythronolide (Fig. 1), is regio- and stereospecifically hydroxylated by P450eryF; several additional steps, including one more P450-catalysed hydroxylation reaction, yield the final erythromycin antibiotic. The most important observation to arise from these new structures is that the overall three-dimensional fold found in P450cam is maintained in the other three P450s de-

trap and study these intermediates, and in one case a crystal structure of the Fe4+=O center has been determined [17"]. The major catalytic difference between P450s and peroxidases is that peroxidases oxidize organic substrates to free radicals. This means that in peroxidases, the substrate is denied direct access to the Fe4+=Ocenter and, hence, cannot be hydroxylated (Fig. 2). The general picture that has emerged from both the crystal structures and chemical-modification work [18] is that the peroxidase substrate interacts at the heme edge where electron transfer occurs. In sharp contrast, the P450 heine edge is not accessible; instead, a substrate pocket is situated directly adjacent to the Fe4+=O center, allowing direct interaction between the substrate and Fe4+=O oxygen atom (Fig. 2).

spite the low (<20%) sequence identity. We can anticipate that all P450s will look the same, even those that are membrane-bound. In the case of the membranebound P450s, it is likely that the N-terminal leader and other hydrophobic patches on the main body of the protein provide the membrane-attachment sites. R.ecent attempts to recombinantly express eukaryotic P450s support the idea that the N-terminal sequences are important for membrane binding [9]. Other efforts have focused more on attaining high levels of expression and extraction and less on expressing water-soluble P450s [10"a 1"1. It also is worth noting that in addition to the new P450 structures, several new heme peroxidase structures have been determined [12-16]. Peroxidases are relevant to P450s because it is generally held that the active ironoxo intermediate formed in peroxidases is similar to that formed in P450s. In both classes of molecule the Fe3+ iron is oxidized to a higher state, with one oxygen atom (derived from 0 2 or peroxide) remaining bound to the iron to give the so-called oxyferryl, Fe4+=O, intermediate. In peroxidases, however, it is possible to

This difference in mechanistic requirements leads to some interesting variations in structure. A recent comparison has been made between the structures of cytochrome c and lignin peroxidase and the structures of P450ca m and P450BM_ 3 [19"*]. Like the P450s, the heine peroxidase fold is maintained in the peroxidases, despite the fact that the sequence identity between cytochrome c peroxidase and lignin peroxidase is only -15'/). What is most interesting, however, is that the two peroxidase structures exhibit a more conserved overall helical fold. The root mean square deviation of the helical segments between the two ~peroxidases is 1.6A and between the two P450s is 2.8 A. Despite the three-dimensional fold shared by all of the P450s, the relative positioning of the helices exhibits large variations in the P450s. This difference derives from the very different substrate binding requirements of the peroxidases compared with the P450s. In peroxidases the substrate can only bind near the heme edge, so substrate interactions are restricted to the surface of the protein. Therefore, changes in substrate specificity are controlled by alterations ill the molecular surface which necessitate few, if any, changes in overall topography. P450s face a greater challenge. The substrate pocket is located within the protein, not

on its surface. Hence, the protein nmst provide an access route to the heine pocket and a specific set of interactions that correctly orients the substrate for stereo- and regioselective hydroxylation. These stricter requirements for substrate binding require changes in the topological relationship between the helices and loops. This is one reason why P450cam has been o f only limited use in homology, modeling of those P450s that operate on substrates that are very different from camphor. The P450ca m and P450ery F structures were solved with a substrate bound, and so these two P450s provide the first opportunity of comparing directly structural differences related to substrate specificity. The most dramatic difference is observed in the position of the B' helix. This helix in P450ca m provides key substrate-protein contact points. It is noteworthy that the B' helix adopts two totally different conformations in the two P450s (Fig. 3). This difference results in a nmch larger active site in P450ery F which is necessary to accommodate the larger 6-deoxyerythronolide substrate. Relocation of the B' helix necessitates movement o f the G helix away from the active site, which also serves to increase the size o f the active-site pocket.

Substrate access and binding
It appears that the access route to the substrate pocket is flexible in P450s. A number of dif/brent complexes with P450ca m have been examined crystallographically, and in at least one case significant changes in the expected access route are observed [20]. However, the P450BM_ 3 structure has been most informative in understanding motion of the access channel. The P450BM_ 3 heine domain crystallizes in the substrate-free tbrnl with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Two different accessroute conformations are encountered in each molecule, one open and the second partially closed. Energy minimization of the open m o n o m e r leads to a large conformational change, resulting in the closing of the access route [3"] (Fig. 1). The closed conformation is also more compatible with binding of fatty acid substrates. Intermolecular contacts in the crystal lattice appear to be responsible for holding the access channel in the open conformation. Subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) sinmlations indicate that this region does indeed experience a large open/close motion [21"]. The B' helix also is important in other P450s. Many P450s have been subjected to site-directed nlutagenesis, and mutants that map in the B' helix region have been shown to alter substrate specificity [22-25]. Not too unexpectedly, the B' helix is one of the most variable and problematic in sequence alignments, because of the presence of gaps and insertions. It is clear from the comparison of the P450ca m and P450ery F that the B' helix and its immediate environment can adopt radically different conformations.

Residues implicated by nmtagenesis studies as being important for controlling activity and substrate specificity are not restricted to the B' helix ·26"]. Although the precise positions o f these residues cannot be determined without the crystal structures, it is often the case that residues found to be important for substrate binding and/or specificity map near regions known to be close to the substrate in the P450ca m and P450ery F structures. Two such regions are a loop that connects two [3-strands

(denoted 'loop' in Fig. 1) and an irregular segment of polypeptide connecting the F and G helices (Fig. 1). Both of these regions provide residues that closely approach the substrate in P450cam and P450eryF. More detailed experimental and theoretical studies on what controls substrate specificity have so far been confined to P450ca m. A combined experimental/MD approach was used to study the stereoselectivity o f norcamphor hydroxylation [27°]. Norcamphor lacks the gem dimethyl groups of camphor, and thus binds more 'loosely' in the active site [1] and is hydroxylated at multiple positions. The simulations performed quite well in predicting the pattern of hydroxylation. Harris and Loew [28 °] carried out a similar study featuring a simulation which also included the stability of the substrate carbon radical intermediates as well as steric properties derived from MD. Both studies showed that where the initial enzyme-substrate X-ray structure is known, theoretical methods can prove extremely useful in understanding the dynamics of substrate bound to the active site. An experimental approach to following substrate entry into the channel has proven a more difficult proposition. Some advances have been made using mutagenesis. In P450cam, for example, an interaction between Asp251 in the distal helix I and two basic groups, Arg186 at the beginning o f the F/G loop and Lys178 in the F helix, helps to anchor the access channel in the closed conformation (see Fig. 1). Changing Asp251 to asparagine mimics the effect that ionic strength has on the diffusion of substrate into the access channel, indicating that disruption of the Arg186/178-Asp251 ionic interactions by either mutagenesis or high ionic strength favors substrate binding [29]. This implies that the access channel is 'loosened', thus allowing easier diffusion of substrate into the pocket. Homology modeling also has been utilised in an attempt to develop structures of P450s for which sequence information is available but the X-ray structures are lacking [23,30,31%32%33,34"]. The usefulness of these models will remain in doubt until either the crystal structures are solved or, more likely, site-directed variants with which to test the models are designed. In one case, that o f human P450Cl 7 [33], the modeling did serve as a guide for mutagenesis. Not too surprisingly, the B' helix is the most difficult to model; the X-ray structures show that the B' helix can adopt radically different conformations (Fig. 3). Current homology-modeling procedures appear to be quite limited in their ability to obtain the level of accuracy required for rational drug design when the starting template, P450cam for example, has a substrate quite different from that of the P450 being modeled. There is room for more optimism with thromboxane synthase [31°], as the substrate, prostaglandin H2, more closely resembles the fatty acid substrates of P450BM_3 than camphor does steroids. At the very least, the increased number of crystal structures for P450 should enable homology-modeling tools to be better applied to the study of P450 structure.

Catalysis
Cleavage of the O - O bond requires protonation of the leaving oxygen atom, indicating that some form of acid catalysis is required: Fe 3 + - O - O - + H +--4Fe 4+=O+HO-

In searching for the acid catalyst, attention has focused on a highly conserved threonine residue, Thr252, in P450cam, which is situated near the middle o f the distal helix I (Fig. 4). The distal helix experiences a local distortion in this region, leaving several peptide groups that would normally participate in helical hydrogen bonds without protein hydrogen-bonding partners. The Thr252 side-chain O H satisfies one of the missing hydrogen bonds by donating a hydrogen bond to the peptide carbonyl oxygen of Gly248, while ordered solvent molecules satisfy the others. Thr252 has been postulated to be the direct proton donor, part of a proton shuttle or a part of the pocket that helps to stabilize the oxy-complex. Recent detailed structural comparisons between P450terp, P450BM-3 and P450cam have raised some questions about the generality of P450cam-based theories on the role of Thr252 and local helical distortion in oxygen activation [35"°]. Most importantly, it was noted that the distortion in helix I in P450terp and P450BM_ 3 differs from that in P450cam. One major difference is that the carbonyl oxygen of the Gly248 homolog not only hydrogen bonds with Thr252 (Fig. 4) but also hydrogen bonds with a water molecule that is coordinated to the iron atom in both P450terp and P450BM_ 3. Therefore, it has been argued that the carbonyl oxygen of the residue analogous to Gly248 will block the oxygen-binding pocket and that the conserved threonine cannot play an important role in O2 binding in P450terp and P450BM_3. One problem with this argument is that the P450terp and P450BM_ 3 crystal structures were solved in their substrate-free, low-spin forms. Like P450cam, both P450terp and P450BM_3 shift to the high-spin form when substrates bind, indicating that, again like P450cam, the axial water ligand is displaced by the substrate. This means that the detailed hydrogen-bonding network and helical distortion near the O2-bmding site must differ between substrate-free and substrate-bound P450s. Therefore, it is not very meaningful to compare structural details of the O2-binding region in substrate-free P450s or to draw mechanistic conclusions from such

asparagine causes a large decrease in activity but also leads to build-up o f a new spectroscopic intermediate [41"]. This has lead to the proposal that Asp251 participates in a relay system that delivers a proton to the dioxygen. Further kinetic isotope studies [42] have indicated that at least two proton transfers are involved in the rate-limiting step. This result can best be rationalized if water molecules form part o f the proton relay. That water may be an important player in P450 catalysis is further evidenced by the structure of P450ery F. This differs from the structures o f other P450s in that Thr252 is replaced with alanine. The large size of the P450ery F substrate precludes the presence of a larger side chain at this position. Nevertheless, a water molecule takes the place of the missing threonine side-chain O H (Fig. 5). P450ery F has a second water 3.8A away from the iron, and this water also hydrogen bonds to a substrate O H group (Fig. 5). Most interestingly, conversion of this same substrate O H to a carbonyl nearly eliminates activity [43]. On the basis o f these results and the crystal structure of P450ery F, a substrate-assisted proton-delivery mechanism in which water is the direct proton donor has been suggested [5"]. Water could play a similar role iia other P450s, although the precise hydrogen-bonding network will differ depending on the size, shape and electrostatic properties o f the substrate. Thr252 then might serve more of a structural role and might not participate directly in acid catalysis in all P450s. The helix I distortion and complex network of solvent-protein hydrogen bonds could serve to ensure proper delivery of solvent protons and help to control the geometry o f dioxygen ligation. Although solvent may be the direct proton donor, the precise mechanism of delivery may differ from one P450 to the next, as a result of the steric restraints imposed by the substrate. P450ery F may have solved this particular problem by using substrate-assisted acid catalysis. That the P450 oxygen-activation step is 'heterogeneous' is supported by the variation observed in heterolytic compared with homolytic cleavage o f the O - O bond among different P450s [44]. This indicates that P450s do not exhibit a universal catalytic mechanism, as we have come to expect from studies with other enzymes. Again, this probably reflects the wide range of properties of the active sites necessitated by the structural requirements of substrate specificity. At the very least, the best current guess as to the identity o f the proton donor is water.

comparisons, as was done in [35"], as only the substrate-bound form is mechanistically relevant. Yet the past year has wimessed several advances in understanding the role of Thr252. It now appears that Thr252 cannot be the direct proton donor. A cell-free protein-synthesis system has been used to replace Thr252 in P450ca m with an unnatural amino acid that carries the threonine side-chain O H in a methylated form [36"]. This mutant retains considerable activity, making it most unlikely that Thr252 is the direct proton donor. Other nmtations at this position in P450ca m (valine and alanine) dramatically lower activity and increase uncoupling [37,38]. For the Thr252-Ala nmtant, the crystal structure shows that the local helix I distortion becomes even more pronounced, allowing more solvent to move into the heine pocket [39]. This unrestricted access of solvent to the active site is thought to be the cause of uncoupling of electron transfer fronl substrate hydroxylation. However, the effect of changing this threonine to other residues is not invariant among all P450s. Mutations at the threonine position have a much less pronounced effect on activity in some eukaryotic P450s [40"], again raising doubts that the threonine residue is universally essential for a functional proton-delivery systenl. Another residue that is receiving attention in the distal helix is Asp251. Most P450s contain either aspartate or glutamate at this position. Converting Asp251 to

Conclusion

Within the past few years the structural information available for P450s has increased four-fold. This information, together with a large number of nmtagenesis studies, has identified which regions o f the structure are most responsible for controlling substrate specificity and has demonstrated how large these variations can

be. It is interesting to note that earlier nmtagenesis results and arguments based on sequence alignments for those regions most responsible for substrate specificity agree well with what we have learned from crystal structures. Details of the catalytic mechanism remain unclear; their elucidation will probably require further mutagenesis studies. One promising approach could be to find mutants that alter the rate-limiting step of the reaction without altering the mechanism, thus enabling the study of intermediates not accessible in the wild-type enzyme. This approach has recently met with success [45]. The new structural information should also make homology modeling of those P450s that are interesting drug-design targets a more fruitful exercise.

Laue diffraction is an old yet only recently employed technique for vastly increasing the amount of X-ray data that can be obtained from protein crystals by using a broad spectrum of X-ray wavelengths rather than the usual single wavelength. The growing interest in this method reflects an increasing availability of high intensity synchrotron X-ray sources which offer the possibility of obtaining nearly complete sets of X-ray intensity data at moderate-to-high resolution in very short periods of time (i.e. seconds). In this way the structures of important semi-transient enzyme intermediates may be obtained. This paper utilizes the method to obtain the structure of the relatively short-lived compound I intermediate formed upon reaction of the peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide. The Laue structure is basically the same as that obtained by more conventional methods which required six crystals [48]. 18. Ortiz de Montellano PR: Catalytic sites of hemoprotein peroxidases.

Ruan K-H, Milfeld K, Kulmacz RJ, Wu KK: Comparison of the construction of a 3°D model for human thromboxane synthase using P450cam and BM-3 as templates: implication for the substrate binding pocket. Protein Eng 1994, 7:1345-1351. The first homology-modeled P450 modeled on the P450BM_3 heine domain structure. P450BM-3 is shown to be a better template for thromboxane synthase than is P450cam based on the higher sequence homology and identity between thromboxane synthase and P450BM_3. 32. · Braatz JA, Bass MB, Ornstein RL: An evaluation of molecular models of the cytochrome P450 Streptomyces griseolus enzymes P450SU1 and P450SU2. J Comput Aided Mol Des 1994, 8:607-622. In addition to predicting a P450 structure, this paper provides a useful anlaysis of modeling methods. The authors test the variation in the homology-modeled P450 structure as a function of sequence-alignment method and energy-minimization protocols. The authors find that the most unreliably modeled region lies within the B' helix which is also important for controlling the size, shape and specificity of the substratebinding pocket. 33.

19. Li H, Poulos TL: Comparative structural analysis of peroxidase ·o and P450 crystal strutures. Structure 1994, 2:461-464 A brief review which compares the structures of lignin peroxidase and cytochrome c peroxidase (15% sequence identity) and those of P450cam and P450BM_3 (17% sequence identity). It is shown that the peroxidases exhibit a far more conservative structure than do the P450s. The differences are related to functional differences between the two classes of enzymes. 20.

Graham-Lorence S, Amarneh B, White RE, Peterson JA, Simpson ER: A three-dimensional model of aromatase cytochrome P450. Protein Sci 1995, 4: ] 065-1080. The most detailed homology modeling effort conducted so far which uses both P450cam and P450BM_3 as templates. This paper also offers a relatively bold and detailed description of how the androstenedione binds to the hypothetical model, in addition to a proposal for the catalytic mechanism. 35. ·· Hasemann CA, Kurumbail RG, Boddupalli SS, Petereson JA, Deisenhofer H: Structure and function of cytochromes P450: a comparative analysis of lhree crystal structures. Structure 1995, 3:41-62. The first detailed structural comparison between P450cam, P450~erp, and P450gM_3. Several important structurally conserved regions are noted and discussed in detail. Sequence alignments based on the crystal structures are especially interesting. Kimata Y, Shimada H, Hirose T, Ishimura Y: Role of Thr252 in cylochrome P450cam: a sludy with unnatural amino acid mutagenesis Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1995, 208:96-102. The first example of the use of a cell-free mutagenesis system to introduce an unnatural amino acid into a P450. The highly conserved Thr252, generally thought to be important in 02 binding and possibly the O-O cleavage step, is converted to methoxy-threonine, in which a methyl group is attached to the side-chain OH. Quite unexpectedly, the enzyme still exhibits substantial activity, with one product molecule formed per 02 consumed. This experiment indicates that Thr252 is very unlikely to be critical as the direct proton donor to the iron-linked 02 molecule. I have examined the possible consequences of this mutation by molecular modeling; it turns out that one extra methyl group can be readily accommodated with only a modest repositioning of groups in the immediate vicinity of the mutation. 36. ·· 37.

The activity of this mutant is significantly lower than that of the wild-type. In addition, an intriguing build-up of a new spectral intermediate is observed under steady-state conditions suggesting a change in the rate-limiting step.
