ABSTRACT: The room-temperature structure of xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) from the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi expressed in Escherichia coli, a 45 kDa, 413-amino acid protein belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5, has been determined by multiple isomorphous replacement and refined to a resolution of 1.42 Å. This represents the first structure of a xylanase not belonging to either glycoside hydrolase family 10 or family 11. The enzyme is composed of two domains similar to most family 10 xylanases and the R-amylases. The catalytic domain (residues 46-315) has a ( /R)8-barrel motif with a binding cleft along the C-terminal side of the -barrel. The catalytic residues, Glu165 and Glu253, determined by correspondence to other family 5 and family 10 glycoside hydrolases, lie inside this cleft on the C-terminal ends of -strands 4 and 7, respectively, with an O 2,,,O 1 distance of 4.22 Å. The smaller domain (residues 31-43 and 323-413) has a 9-barrel motif with five of the strands interfacing with R-helices 7 and 8 of the catalytic domain. The first 13 N-terminal residues form one -strand of this domain. Residues 44, 45, and 316-322 form the linkers between this domain and the catalytic domain.

Glycoside hydrolases are enzymes that cleave polysaccharides at the glycosidic linkage between furanose or pyranose rings by either a configuration-retaining or a configuration-inverting acid-catalyzed mechanism. They have been classified into 91 family groupings based on sequence similarity (1-9). Xylanases are glycoside hydrolases with specific activity toward xylan, the hemicellulosic fraction of plant tissues composing one-third of all renewable organic carbon available on earth (10). Study of xylanases in an effort to understand the basis of catalysis and specificity, therefore, has a twofold purpose: (1) to engineer more efficient enzymes for utilization in industrial processes that take advantage of this plentiful, renewable resource and (2) to develop inhibitors to protect this resource and economically important crops from attack by microorganisms that utilize these enzymes to destroy the same. Xylanases, like all -1,4-glycan hydrolases, utilize a general acid mechanism of catalysis promoted by two acidic amino acid residues, an acid or base and a nucleophile. In

the case of xylanases, only glutamic acid residues have been identified as the catalytic amino acids. Specific recognition of substrate depends on the active site topology and a series of binding subsites on the surface of the enzyme (7-9). Xylanases have been placed predominantly in families 5, 10, 11, and 43 in the glycoside hydrolase (GH)1 family classification scheme (1-3). However, only three-dimensional structures of xylanases from families 10 and 11 have been reported. Glycoside hydrolase families 5 (GH-5) and 10 (GH-10) are members of a superfamily or clan GH-A, which also includes GH families 1, 2, 17, 26, 30, 35, 39, 42, 51, 53, 59, 72, 79, and 86. The clan concept demonstrates a broader relationship between GH families that suggests a more distant common evolutionary ancestor (11). The family 11 xylanases are low-molecular weight proteins of 184-207 amino acids that fold into a -sheet motif. Structures have been reported for enzymes from bacteria [e.g., Bacillus circulans (12-15), B. circulans strain D3 (16), and Bacillus agaradhaerens (17)] and fungi [e.g., Paecilomyces Varioti (18, 19), Thermomyces lanuginosus (20), Trichoderma reesei (21-23), Aspergillus niger (24), and Aspergillus kawachii (18)]. Structures have been reported for family 10 xylanases from both bacteria [e.g., Cellulomonas fimi (25-29), Pseudomonas fluorescens (30, 31), Streptomyces liVidans (32, 33), Streptomyces oliVaceoViridis (34, 35)] and fungi [e.g., Penicillium simplicissimum (36, 37) and Thermoascus aurantiacus

These enzymes are considerably larger, at more than 400 amino acids in most cases, and generally contain a catalytic domain or module (CD) and a smaller carbohydratebinding module (CBM). The xylanase from P. simplicissimum lacks a CBM. Of the GH-10 structures reported to date, all but one (S. oliVaceoViridis) contain only the isolated catalytic domains. Although the xylanase from S. oliVaceoViridis was crystallized with both the CD and the CBM, the connecting Gly/Pro-rich linker between the two modules was not evident in electron density maps. which suggests the possibility that the CBM is loosely attached to the CD and that the position of the CBM in the crystal structure may be determined more by packing than by interactions with the catalytic domain. As previously reported by Keen et al. (41), xylanase from Erwinia chrysanthemi (designated XynA in this paper) is significantly homologous to vertebrate cerebrosidases, which are members of family 30, and to family 5 glycoside hydrolases. XynA has since been classified in GH-5 (1). A BLAST search of the PIR-NREF database at the PIR website (42), utilizing the full 413-amino acid sequence of XynA, found 13 GH-5 sequences with levels of identity in the range of 25-82% and levels of homology in the range of 4490% and 18 GH-30 sequences with levels of identity in the range of 20-27% and levels of homology in the range of 36-45%. The endoxylanase from Pectobacterium chrysanthemi is 82% identical to XynA. All 13 GH-5 proteins possessing some level of sequence identity with XynA have been identified as having xylanase activity. No structures of these 13 enzymes have been determined to date. GH-5 enzymes contain seven invariant residues in five conserved stretches corresponding to five of the eight -strands of the -barrel. Four of the five stretches containing six of the seven invariant residues are found in XynA. On the basis of this sequence similarity, the catalytic residues were postulated to be Glu165 and Glu253 (41). These structural studies have confirmed these assignments. XynA was first isolated from cultures of E. chrysanthemi SR120A, obtained from corn, and characterized as having xylanase activity by Braun and Rodrigues (43). Subsequently, Keen et al. (41) cloned the gene in Escherichia coli and obtained the secreted protein from the bacterial periplasm. Recently, XynA was found to be most active on xylan substrates substituted with R-1,2-linked 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid, cleaving the substrate between the first and second xylose units from the glucuronic acid-substituted xylose on the nonreducing end (44). Despite these studies, no experimental determinations of the catalytic mechanism, the catalytic residues, or the function of the small domain have been reported. In the absence of such determinations, we can only speculate about these issues by analogy to homologous structures. Thus, since GH-5 enzymes operate through a configuration-retaining mechanism with glutamic acids on -strands 4 and 7 acting as catalytic residues (19), XynA is expected to function by the same mechanism. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Production, Preparation, and Crystallization of the Enzyme. Xylanase from E. chrysanthemi was cloned and expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (41). As reported elsewhere, the purified enzyme crystallized

Data Collection. Room-temperature diffraction data for both native and derivatized crystals were collected at a wavelength of 1.54 Å with a San Diego Multiwire Systems dual-detector system equipped with a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode X-ray generator. Two crystals were used for the native data set. The native Rsym was 0.066 for 206 521 observations, yielding a unique set of native data containing 58 915 reflections with a redundancy of 3.5 observations per reflection (see Table 1). Structure Solution. Attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement using GH-10 xylanase models found in the Protein Data Bank (46) proved to be fruitless. Therefore, the focus was diverted to obtaining experimental phase information by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR). Heavy atom-soaked crystals were prepared by adding to the crystallization drops containing native crystals a solution of a heavy atom compound. Crystals were mounted by conventional means in quartz capillaries and data collected at room temperature as for the native crystals described above. A total of 33 heavy atom derivative data sets were collected, each from a single crystal. All 33 derivative data sets were input individually to the program SOLVE (47-51) which produced prospective heavy atom sites for 27 of the derivatives (resolution range of 3-11 Å). Analysis of the phasing power and Rcullis from heavy atom site refinement and cross phasing of derivative difference maps reduced the number of useful derivatives to four. The heavy atom sites of these four derivatives were refined at resolution ranges of 7-11, 6-11, 5-11, 4.5-11, 4-11, 3.5-11, and 3-11 Å. On the basis of the phasing power and the refinement stability, the useful resolution ranges of these four data sets were identified as indicated in Table 2. Thus, 3-11 Å data were used for the HgCl2/AuCl3 derivative, 4-11 Å data for two other derivatives, and 7-11 Å data for the fourth derivative. The overall figure of merit for this final MIR phase set was 0.49. Early in our efforts, the HgCl2/AuCl3 derivative was identified as an excellent single-site derivative producing a phasing power of >1.0 down to a resolution of 3 Å. Therefore, this derivative was used as a monitor for phase quality. Any phase set in question, whether derived from a model, a solvent-flattened MIR map [using the program PHASES (52)], or phase combination of MIR and model phases (also using the program PHASES), was used to phase a HgCl2/AuCl3 - native difference density map for 3-11 Å data. The peak height of the Hg/Au site (in  units) served as an indicator of the quality of the phase set. The final MIR

Phases from the best models (based on peak heights of the Hg/Au site) of successive rebuilds were combined with the MIR phases followed by solvent flattening (with PHASES) until the model was satisfactory for producing relatively unbiased model-phased 2Fo - Fc maps for model building. This occurred when the model alone resulted in a phase set that gave an Hg/Au peak of 29. It was also at this point that a small six-residue sequence (residues 286-291, YVWWYI) was identified in the maps from which the entire sequence could be fitted to the map with minimal subsequent modifications of the sequence assignment. The final model phase set produced an Hg/Au peak of 41.5 in the monitor difference map. Structure Refinement. The structure was refined isotropically with XPLOR to an R of 0.149 (Rfree ) 0.182; 1.42 Å < d < 50 Å and F > 4F) with 271 water molecules in the model and a bulk solvent correction applied. Refinement was continued with the program SHELXL-97 (58) with all fully occupied non-hydrogen atoms treated anisotropically, partially occupied non-hydrogen atoms refined isotropically, and hydrogen atoms riding in ideal positions with B factors equal to 1.2 or 1.5 times the thermal parameter (B/Beq) of the atom to which they were bound. Water molecules were automatically picked by the SHELWAT routine and then confirmed by difference density maps [nFo - (n - 1)Fc maps] and hydrogen bonding considerations.

phase set produced an Hg/Au peak of 67. The phase set obtained by solvent flattening of the MIR map produced a peak of 51. Phase extension to 2.5-20 Å produced a phase set that yielded a peak of only 34. The model was built [using the programs O (53) for building and MAPMAN (54) for converting XPLOR (5557) maps to O maps] according to the MIR, density-modified MIR, and phase-extended density-modified MIR maps, producing a model whose phase set produced a peak for the Hg/Au site of only 24. This served as a baseline for model comparison. The model phases were combined with the MIR phases, and new maps were generated at various resolutions and with solvent flattening and phase extension. The model was rebuilt to these maps, resulting in a phase set that produced an Hg/Au peak of 27 in the monitoring map. Attempted refinement of this model (using XPLOR) gave model phase sets that produced smaller peaks for the Hg/

The Model. The final model consists of 383 amino acids (residues 31-413 in the enzyme sequence), 522 water molecules, and one acetate ion. The rms deviations from geometrical ideality are as follows: 0.010 Å for bonds, 2.13° for angles, 17.7° for dihedral angles, 1.40° for improper angles, and 3.8° for the deviation in  from planarity. The estimated average error in the coordinates is 0.06 Å, as determined by the method of Luzzati (59). Electron density maps around the segment of residues 198-203 containing the cis-Ala201 in -strand 5 of the catalytic domain are shown in Figure 1. A Ramachandran plot (61), produced with the program PROCHECK (62), shows 90.4% of non-glycine and non-proline residues in the most favored regions, 8.7% in the additionally allowed regions, and three residues (Glu165, Asp257, and Trp289) in the generously allowed regions; there are no residues in the disallowed regions.

The XBM has nine -strands forming an elliptical 9-barrel. The first strand is composed of residues 31-43, the first 13 residues of the secreted enzyme. The last 91 residues in the sequence form the other eight -strands (see Figure 3). Both linker peptides connect the XBM to the CD on the back side of the catalytic domain. As seen in Figure 2b, the XBM is positioned somewhat to the back side of the CD. Strands 2-4, 6, and 9 of the small module form the interface with R-helices 7 and 8 of the CD. The interface is distributed between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues and includes 11 hydrogen bonds between R-helices 7 and 8 and the adjacent -sheet. Approximately 1200 Å2 of each domain is buried by the formation of this interface with only 10% contributed by charged residues. Interactions involved in this interface are listed in Table 6. Water Molecules and the Acetate Ion. The water structure is quite extensive. There are 319 water molecules with full occupancy, 108 water molecules with 50% occupancy, and 95 disordered water molecules (defined as sharing space with other atoms in the model). There are 430 waters in the first hydration shell and 92 waters in the second hydration shell of the enzyme. The distribution of modeled waters is listed in Table 5. The acetate ion, which has an average Beq of 23 Å2, is bound to Arg293, bridging atoms N and N 1 while also interacting with the OH group of Tyr295. Molecular Packing. Xylanase molecules have 10 neighbors in the unit cell. Table 7 lists the hydrogen-bonded interactions between the reference molecule and its neighbors. This list includes salt bridges between Glu176 and Arg99 and between Glu181 and Arg99. The XBM in XynA has possibly eight stabilizing hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules, all but two of these being formed with XBMs of neighboring molecules. There are 41 water molecules involved in intermolecular interactions (within 3.5 Å of two xylanase molecules). DISCUSSION Comparison to Family 5 and Family 10 Glycoside Hydrolases. Comparison of XynA to the known GH-5 and GH-10 structures identifies Glu165 and Glu253 as the catalytic residues. This confirms the originally proposed assignments (41). Unlike many GH-5 and GH-10 enzymes, XynA contains no disulfide bonds. Most disulfide bonds serve to stabilize floppy loops, but the shorter loops of XynA apparently need no such stabilization. Using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (42), pairwise alignment of the XynA sequence with sequences of family 5 glycoside hydrolases found two xylanases of Aeromonas caViae to be more than 40% identical for 275 residues of the XynA catalytic domain sequence. Attempts to align the XynA CD sequence (275 amino acids) with a number of other family 5 sequences and with family 10 xylanases never resulted in a simultaneous match of both catalytic residues. Clearly, the fact that GH-5 and GH-10 families are members of the GH-A clan implies that they share some common features, namely, a common fold, the same type of catalytic mechanism, and several conserved residues (11). Since the level of sequence similarity is low, we compare XynA with

domain has not been determined, but by analogy to GH-10 xylanases, it is probably a carbohydrate-binding, or more specifically, a xylan-binding module. In this paper, it will be termed the small domain or module but abbreviated as XBM. The first 30 residues (the leader peptide) are missing from the structure due to cleavage by E. coli during secretion to the bacterial periplasm (41). Figure 2 illustrates the secondary structure and the molecular shape. The enzyme is approximately 68 Å long by 45 Å wide by 38 Å thick. Catalytic Domain. The catalytic domain has the common ( /R)8-barrel folding motif consisting of residues 46-315. The -barrel is elliptical in shape, and the connecting loops to the R-helices are generally shorter on the N-terminal side of the barrel (4.5 residues/loop) than are the loops on the C-terminal side (11.2 residues/loop; subsequently termed the back side and front side of the barrel, respectively). As is generally the case in clan GH-A glycoside hydrolases, the longer loops of the C-terminal side of the -barrel take part in the formation of the binding cleft around the active site. Catalytic Binding Cleft. The active site residues, Glu165 and Glu253, are positioned on opposite sides of the catalytic binding cleft at the C-terminal ends of -strands 4 and 7. Glu165 is actually situated in the loop following -strand 4 and, by analogy to related structures, serves as the acid or base. Glu253 is the nucleophile during catalytic hydrolysis. The carboxyl oxygen atoms of closest approach of the catalytic residues are 4.22 Å apart. The cleft is decidedly negative as shown in Figure 4. However, the binding cleft contains a number of aromatic residues that can serve as the scaffolding for the docking of the pyranose rings of the substrate. These include Trp55, Tyr172, Trp168, and Tyr232.

a Except for XynA, the PDB entries for the various structures are used to identify the representative GH-5 and GH-10 glycoside hydrolases used in this analysis.

The alignment was determined by three-residue superpositioning followed by rigid body refinement using XPLOR in which the distances between CR atoms of equivalent residues were minimized. During this process, "equivalent residues" were defined as those residues having CR distances of e2 Å. The subset of equivalent and identical residues and the rms deviation of the CR atoms of the equivalent residues are listed. The averages of the individual superpositions, at the bottom of Table 8, reveal that xylanase from E. chrysanthemi is about as structurally similar (or not similar) to the family 5 glycoside hydrolases as it is to the family 10 xylanases. Its level of structural similarity to the family 10 xylanases is about the same as the average of the other GH-5 glycoside hydrolases to the GH-10 xylanases. However, in terms of

the average number of equivalent (115 vs 169) and identical (17 vs 36) residues, xylanase XynA is less similar to the group of family 5 glycoside hydrolases used in this study than that group is to itself, although the average rms deviation between CR atoms of equivalent residues is similar. In general, family 5 glycoside hydrolases are a more structurally diverse family than the family 10 xylanases as indicated by the average number of equivalent residues (169 vs 266) and identical residues (36 vs 125) and the average rms deviation of equivalent CR atoms (1.25 Å vs 0.95 Å). This observed diversity has prompted a further classification of the GH-5 family into at least nine subfamilies (68). Figure 5 shows the superposition of a representative from each of the family 5 and family 10 glycoside hydrolase families onto XynA.

The excellent fit of the XynA -barrel to both is apparent; the differences in the front side loop structure and the R-helices are also obvious. All conserved residues are either in the -strands of the barrel or near the beginning of the loops extending from the -barrel strands. This figure was rendered with the programs MOLSCRIPT (63) and RASTER3D (64).

In each case, the -barrels of the catalytic domains align well. There is little correlation in the positioning, orientation, and length of the helices surrounding the -barrel; the wide variation in loop size, especially on the C-terminal side of the -barrel, produces a broad spectrum of diverse loop structures. Catalytic Residues. Generally, both the GH-5 and GH-10 families have a narrow range of CR,,,CR and O ,,,O distances between catalytic residues in the uncomplexed structures. Except for the apparent anomaly of the endoglucanase of Clostridium thermocellum [PDB entry 1CEC (69)] in the GH-5 family, the CR,,,CR distances of the catalytic residues in this family range from 9.67 to 10.77 Å and the O ,,,O distances range from 3.13 to 4.20 Å. In XynA, these quantities are near this range: 10.01 and 4.22 Å, respectively. The C. thermocellum, on the other hand, has distances of 12.74 and 10.05 Å for the CR,,,CR and O ,,,O distances, respectively. However, once the substrate binds, the loop containing Glu140 (the catalytic acid or base) moves 3 Å with rotation of the Glu140 side chain by 90°, resulting in an O ,,,O distance of 4.3 Å, consistent with the other GH-5 enzymes (70). The corresponding ranges for the GH-10 xylanases are 12.50-12.72 and 5.08-5.62 Å, respectively, which are very distinct from the GH-5 ranges. ConserVed Residues. Perusal of the literature reveals some confusion concerning the conserved residues in the GH-5 glycoside hydrolases. Some references state that there are eight conserved residues (71-73), while others claim that there are seven (74, 75). The seven consensus residues are (1) an arginine in -strand 2, (2) a histidine in the 3R3loop, (3 and 4) the asparagine-glutamic acid catalytic pair at the end of -strand 4, (5 and 6) a His-X-Tyr tripeptide at the end of -strand 6, and (7) the other catalytic glutamic acid at the end of -strand 7. In those papers that claim there are eight conserved residues, the eighth residue is a tryptophan in -strand 8. Table 9 demonstrates that there is good alignment of the conserved residues among the known family 5 glycoside hydrolases. However, it is clear that XynA has a tryptophan in the place of the histidine in the 3R3-loop. The sequence alignment between XynA and nine family 5 glycoside hydrolases that are more than 25% identical and

a tryptophan corresponding to Trp113 in the 3R3-loop of XynA were all identified as xylanases. However, there are no three-dimensional structures of any of these enzymes to confirm the identical positioning of their tryptophan residues. One interesting anomaly to these correspondences is the -mannanase from T. reesei [PDB entry 1QNR (71)]. Sequence alignment and hydrophobic cluster analysis identify His102 as the conserved histidine residue; there are no other histidine residues between position 102 and the catalytic acid or base, Glu169, in the sequence. However, the CR atom of His102 is 24 Å from the generally observed position of the corresponding conserved histidine residues. Instead, Asn112 lies near this structural position. Thus, although the sequence suggests His102 is conserved, structurally it is not conserved. Unfortunately, no structure of -mannanase from T. reesei having substrate bound in site -1 has been determined. Therefore, the residue, if any, that plays the role of the conserved histidine (i.e., binding O3 of the mannose at the -1 site) remains a mystery. This question arises: is the deposited sequence correct? If not, does the density at residue 112 in the 1.5 Å electron density maps suggest the presence of a histidine residue? The putative conserved histidine in the GH-5 enzymes is replaced with a conserved tryptophan in the family 10 xylanases. Clearly, XynA and the other GH-5 xylanases mentioned above are similar to the GH-10 xylanases in this sense. This would suggest an important role in xylose

The enzyme residues and all carbohydrate sites are labeled. Interactions between the protein and the xylohexaose are represented by black dashed lines as follows (protein to xylose): Y172 OH-O3 (-1 site), W113 N -O3 (-1 site), N164 N2-O2 (-1 site), E165 O 2-O4 (+1 site), E253 O 1-C1 (-1 site), W289 N 1-O2 (-2 site), and Y290 OH-O3 (-2 site). The pyranose ring at the -3 site lies flat against the indole ring of Trp55. Leu204 sits in the channel formed by Trp168 and Tyr232, forcing the reducing end of the xylohexaose out of the channel and perhaps distorting the molecular structure at the -1 and +1 sites, thus facilitating bond breakage.

specificity for this tryptophan. However, in the GH-10 enzymes, this tryptophan is hydrogen bonded to the catalytic acid residue, whereas no such bond is established in XynA. Instead, the tryptophan N 1 superimposes nicely on the N 2 atoms of the equivalent histidine residues of the GH-5 glycoside hydrolases. ActiVe Site Residues and Substrate Binding. Analysis of the structures of substrate- and/or inhibitor-bound glycoside hydrolases from both GH families 5 and 10 suggests a mode of binding of polyxylose to XynA, at least in nonreducing sites -1, -2, and -3. This postulated structure is illustrated in Figure 6. In the model, the xylose in site -1 interacts with Trp113, Asn164, Glu165, Tyr172, and Glu253; the xylose in site -2 is hydrogen bonded to Trp289 and Tyr290 and in contact with Tyr172, and the xylose ring in site -3 lies across the face of the indole ring of Trp55. The path of the reducing end of a polyxylose substrate is difficult to discern. The aromatic rings of Trp168 and Tyr232 are parallel, forming a channel approximately 7.5 Å wide into which a polyxylose chain could be accommodated comfortably except for the presence of Leu204 in this channel. The presence of this leucine may assist in distorting the glycosidic linkage between the -1 and +1 moieties which would facilitate bond breakage. On the other hand, there is space into which the Leu204 side chain could rotate to allow more penetration of the polyxylose into the Trp/ Tyr channel. According to Hurlbert and Preston (44), XynA has specificity for xylan containing an R-1,2-linked 4-Omethyl-D-glucuronic acid substituent attached to the xylose moiety in the +2 binding site. They state that the specificity

is a result of carboxylate group recognition by the enzyme; how this recognition is achieved is unclear from modeling. Carbohydrate-Binding Modules. Whether the apparently strong interface between the catalytic domain and the small domain is maintained in solution cannot be determined from these studies. The fact that there are two linkers between the domains may reduce the probability that the domains would separate in solution. As seen in Figure 2b, the linkers could conceivably act as a hinge to allow the XBM to swing out away from the CD. The substrate modeling studies presented here provide no insights into possible substrateXBM binding because of the ambiguity of the interaction at the reducing end of the active site cleft. There are two aromatic residues (Tyr386 and Trp401) with significant solvent (and, hence, substrate) accessibility in the XBM. Either one or both of these residues may provide a binding platform for a carbohydrate substrate. To our knowledge, the XBM module of XynA has not been classified. Table 10 lists the results of a BLAST search of the PIR-NREF database (42) using the last 94 amino acids of the XynA sequence. Nine unique proteins were found to match the XBM segment with levels of identity in the range of 31-84%, and all were identified as GH-5 enzymes with xylanase activity. This circumstantial evidence suggests that XBM is probably a xylan-binding module. Match 9 is only a fragment almost entirely composed of the XBM-like sequence. For the other eight matches, the results of the alignment of the catalytic domains with XynA are also included. For these eight matches, there is good alignment with both the XBM and the CD of XynA. Match 1 comes

Larson et al. xylanases make up a very closely related family with a high percentage of spatially equivalent and identical residues and small rms deviations between equivalent residues. The GH-5 glycoside hydrolases are a more diverse group of enzymes but still possess greater self-equivalency than is seen between GH-5 and GH-10 structures. XynA, although it has been classified as a family 5 glycoside hydrolase, is no more structurally equivalent to GH-5 than it is to GH-10, and in fact, it is approximately as equivalent to the GH-5 structures as the GH-5 structures are on average to the GH-10 structures.

FIGURE 7: Representative carbohydrate-binding modules containing approximately 90 amino acids. In panel a is the XBM of XynA. In panel b is a representative of CBM-20 from B. circulans strain 251 (PDB entry 1CDG). In panel c is a representative of CBM-2 from C. fimi (PDB entry 2XBD), determined by NMR. In panel d is the CBM from pig pancreatic R-amylase (78). The structures in panels a, b, and d have a similar folding pattern, whereas that in panel c has a different pattern despite having approximately the same number of amino acids. This figure was rendered with the programs MOLSCRIPT (63) and RASTER3D (64).

from the same species as XynA, but from a different strain, which is clearly evident in the high level of identity between the two. Matches 2 and 3 obviously are similar to XynA, having approximately the same overall length; matches 4-8, on the other hand, appear to have at least a second C-terminal module of approximately 100-170 amino acids. In comparison to matches 4-7, match 8 appears to have a third C-terminal module. To our knowledge, none of the modules of matches 1-8 that align with the XBM have been classified in the CBM classification scheme. We were able to identify three CBM families containing CBMs of approximately 100 residues, namely, CBM-2, CBM-20, and CBM-21. We found no three-dimensional structures for members of CBM-21. CBM-2 is represented only by NMR structures. Figure 7 offers a visual comparison between the XBM and representatives of CBM-2 (76) and CBM-20 (77), as well as porcine pancreatic R-amylase [PPA (78)] (whose CBM appears to remain unclassified at this time, but could very well belong to CBM-20). Coordinates of both the CBM-20 and CBM-2 representatives are from the Protein Data Bank (46). Clearly, XBM has the same topology as CBM-20 and PPA, while the CBM-2 model has a different topology. Conclusion. The high-resolution three-dimensional structure of xylanase XynA from E. chrysanthemi has been determined. By analogy to GH-5 and GH-10 structures in the Protein Data Bank (46), the catalytic residues are identified as Glu165 and Glu253. Seven aromatic amino acids are involved in the formation of the active site binding cleft. The structural alignment data show that GH-10
