Abstract The in vitro selection of combinatorial libraries of RNA/DNA, has allowed the identification of specific nucleic acids (aptamers) which bind to a wide range of target molecules with high affinity and specificity. In this work, an RNA aptamer, specific for the protein trans-activator of transcription (Tat) of HIV-1, has been used as bio-recognition element to develop a biosensor (aptasensor). The biosensor was optimised using piezoelectric quartz-crystals as transducers and the aptamer was immobilised on the gold electrode of the crystal. The immobilisation procedure was based on the interaction between the biotinylated aptamer and streptavidin previously deposited on the electrode. The main analytical characteristics of the biosensor, such as sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility, have been studied in details. An optimised regeneration procedure allowed the multiple use of the aptamer-coated crystal. The aptasensor has been compared with the corresponding immunosensor, based on the specific monoclonal anti-Tat antibody. The antibody was immobilised on a layer of carboxylated dextran previously deposited on the gold electrode. The results demonstrated that the use of a biosensor with a specific aptamer as bio-recognition element could be an interesting approach in the detection of proteins, which has been here examined considering a model system. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The recent understandings on the structure and functions of nucleic acids and, specifically, on their power as both informational and ligand binding molecules, opened new scenarios in the development of new affinity sensors (Luzi et al., 2003). In particular, the development of the in vitro selection and amplification technique, called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) (Tuerk and Gold, 1990; Ellington and Szostak, 1990), has allowed the identification of specific nucleic acids (aptamers) that bind to a wide range of target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Many small organic molecules with molecular weights from 100 to 1000 Da have been shown to be good targets

for selection (Jayasena, 1999) and aptamers can be also `produced' against difficult target haptens, such as toxins (Jayasena, 1999) or prions (Proske et al., 2002). Aptamers can mimic antibodies in a wide variety of applications, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunobead assays (Liss et al., 2002). Antibodies and aptamers can bind the relative target with high affinity and specificity. Anyway, aptamers offer advantages over antibodies that make them very promising in analytical and diagnostic applications. The main advantage is the overcoming of the use of animal systems for the production of the molecules--aptamers are isolated by in vitro methods which are independent by animals and they can be generated against any target (non-immunogenic or toxic). The specificity of molecular recognition combined with the easy by which target-binding aptamers can be selected, designed and chemically modified, makes these molecules very attractive as tools for therapeutic (White et al., 2000),

diagnostic (Brody and Gold, 2000) and analytical applications (Scheller et al., 2001). Several bioanalytical assays, including biosensors, based on aptamers have been reported (Davis et al., 1998; Fang et al., 2001; Jhaveri et al., 2000). Development of biosensors with aptamers as bio-recognition element (aptasensors), is getting impulse by the use of optical, acoustic and fluorescent methods to analyse in real-time biological phenomena in solution or by immobilising the aptamer onto a solid support. In exploring the potential of RNA aptamers as smallmolecules discriminating tools, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology has been applied to study the selection of new aptamers against specific targets, to be used as therapeutic agents (Gebhardt et al., 2000). Some more papers have appeared in literature very recently, in which SPR is used for studying the interaction between the selected aptamers and their relative targets (Kawakami et al., 2000; Fukusaki et al., 2001; Rhodes et al., 2001; Lisdat et al., 2001). A second interesting technology used to generate aptasensors is the quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM). This technique was used to study the interactions of HIV-1 trans-activation response element (TAR) RNA with trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein, responsible of HIV-1 RNA virus infection (Furtado et al., 1999). Chemically synthesised biotinylated TAR RNA was immobilised on the sensor surface, incorporated in an on-line system, using the biotin-neutravidin interaction. Binding of two peptide fragments of Tat on the TAR RNA resulted in a change in both resonance frequency and motional resistance. A second system directly compared the performances obtained using a DNA aptamer or the antibody specific for human IgE, chosen as target analyte (Liss et al., 2002). Both receptors selectively detected 0.5 nM of IgE. The linear detection range was 10-fold higher when aptamers were used. In this paper, an RNA aptamer has been used as bio-recognition element to develop an aptasensor for the detection of Trans-Activator of Transcription protein. Tat is a protein of 86 to 101 amino acids controlling the early phase of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication cycle (Chang et al., 1997; Mucha et al., 2002). Only a few papers are reported in the literature regarding the development of detection methods for this protein, and most of the works have been conducted using Tat-derived peptides and not the full length protein (Furtado et al., 1999; Kawakami et al., 2000; Mucha et al., 2002). Westendorp et al. (1995), reported a study on the molecular mechanism of apoptosis in HIV-1 infection in which a concentration of Tat in the range 0.01­10 ng/ml was determined by a dot-blot assay in sera and supernatant of HIV-1 infected patients. Tat comprises several functional regions--a cysteine-rich region (aa 22­37), which participates in intra-molecular disulfide bond formation; a core region (38­48); an arginine-rich region (49­57); a short basic motif, which is

directly involved in binding of the trans-activation response element RNA. This element (Fig. 1a), a 59 nucleotide stem-loop structure located at the 5 -end of all retroviral mRNAs, regulates the transcription by interacting with Tat protein. The Tat binding region in the TAR centres on a trinucleotide bulge, which is flanked by helical regions (Fig. 1a). The loop is important for transcription in vivo, but is not involved in the binding of Tat (Edwards et al., 2002). Yamamoto et al. (2000a,b) was the first to develop an aptamer that yielded an efficient binding specificity against Tat, but not for other cellular factors. This novel aptamer RNATAT demonstrated a 133 times higher binding affinity than TAR RNA (59-mer). The aptamer has a TAR-like motif in its randomised region, having two bulge units adjacent to one another in opposite orientations (Fig. 1b). The core element for binding to Tat is a four central base pair helix flanked by two residues on each side. This aptamer is a very promising bio-recognition element for the detection of Tat, since it combines unique characteristics such as high affinity for Tat and possibility of altering its design to enhance sensitivity and stabilisation against nucleases, allowing monitoring of viral protein levels in vivo. In this work, this RNA aptamer has been immobilised on the gold electrode of piezoelectric quartz-crystals and the interaction with Tat protein in solution has been studied following the changes in the oscillation frequency of the crystal. The main analytical parameters of the aptasensor, such as sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility, have been studied. Moreover, a comparison with the relative immunosensor developed immobilising an anti-Tat antibody, has been conducted. The two biosensors have been realised using the

same immobilisation chemistry for the two different receptors (RNA aptamer and antibody), based on a thiol/dextran modification of the gold electrode surface.

2. Material and methods 2.1. Reagents Reagents for the modification of the gold surface of the sensor and for the immobilisation of the receptors are listed below: · NH3 , H2 O2 , ethanol, NaOH and sodium acetate were purchased from Merck (Milan, Italy); 11-mercaptoundecanol, bis-2-metoxyethyl ether, bromoacetic acid, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC) and ethanolamine were purchased from Sigma (Milan, Italy), epichlorohydrin from Fluka (Milan, Italy) and dextran from Amersham Bioscience (Milan, Italy); streptavidin was purchased from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). The composition of the buffers used for the experiments is reported below: · Immobilisation buffer: 0.01 M N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N -2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), pH 7.4. · Binding buffer: 0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% TWEEN 20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumine (BSA), pH 7.4. EDTA was purchased from Merck (Milan, Italy); all the other reagents for the buffers were from Sigma (Milan, Italy). For the regeneration of the sensors different solutions containing either sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS, Sigma, Milan, Italy) or different percentages of NaOH and EtOH were used. The RNA aptamer (Fig. 1b) was obtained from IBA (Göttinghen, Germany) and its base sequence is given below: · 5 -biotin-ACG AAG CUU GAU CCC GUU UGC CGG UCG AUC GCU UCG A-3 To preserve the RNA from RNase degradation, solutions and materials (glassware, tips, etc.), in direct contact with the aptamer, were treated with specific RNase inhibitors. RnaseZAPTM (Sigma, Milan, Italy) was used to clean glass and plastic surfaces (work areas, pipettes, equipment and the piezoelectric cell), followed by rinsing with H2 O treated with 0.1% DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) (Sigma, Milan, Italy). All the solutions for the experiments were prepared in DEPC-treated H2 O and filtered with 0.2 m filters (Nalgene, Milan, Italy).DEPC-treated H2 O was prepared adding 1 ml of DEPC to 1 l of MilliQ water and stirred overnight. The solution was then autoclaved at 1 atm for 20 min.

Tat protein (recombinant Tat HIV-1 IIIB, total length of 86 amino acids) and murine anti-tat HIV IIIB monoclonal antibody were purchased from Immunodiagnostic Inc. (Woburn, MA, USA). Because the easy oxidation of Tat leads to inactivation and loss of biological activities (Ensoli et al., 1993), Tat stock solution, 100 ppm in 0.2 M KCl and 5 mM glutathione, was stored at -80  C and further dilutions were performed in the dark, in ice and with BSA 0.1% containing solutions. Different proteins were used as negative controls to test the specificity of the aptamer--BCL-2 (from B-cell lymphoma), an anti-apoptotic factor of 25 kDa with a tail of GST (Glutathione S-Transferase) of 19 kDa; hIgG, of 160 kDa (Sigma, Milan, Italy); HIV Rev (Regulator of Expression of Viral proteins), a basic protein of 14 kDa (kindly donated by the UK Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK). A biotinylated polyT(20) probe (MWG, Ebersberg, Germany) was used as negative control to be immobilised onto the sensor surface to further test the specificity of the interaction between Tat and the aptamer. 2.2. Apparatus 10 MHz AT cut quartz-crystals (14 mm, 165 m) with gold evaporated (42.6 mm2 area, Ø 7.4 mm) on both sides were obtained by Mistral (Latina, Italy). The crystal was housed inside a methacrylate cell with only one side in contact with the solution in the well. The frequency variations were continuously recorded with the quartz in contact with the solution, using a quartz-crystal analyser, PZ 105 from Universal Sensor Inc. (Metairie, LA, USA). The resonance frequency was displayed in real-time and recorded using a computer connected to the instrument interface. All the measurements have been performed at room temperature (T  20  C). = 2.3. Modification of the sensor surface The surface was modified by immobilising two different affinity capturing agents for Tat protein: the aptamer and the anti-Tat antibody. The immobilisation chemistry followed the approach described in Tombelli et al. (2000). The gold on the quartz was modified with 11-mercaptoundecanol and carboxylated dextran to immobilise streptavidin or anti-Tat antibody. The biotinylated aptamer was further immobilised on the streptavidin layer through biotin-streptavidin interaction. Before coating, the crystal was washed with a 1:1:5 solution of H2 O2 , NH3 and distilled water, respectively. 2.3.1. Aptamer immobilisation After the cleaning step, the crystal was washed with MilliQ water and placed in the cell. The surface of the crystal was activated prior to covalent coupling with 200 l of a solution of NHS 50 mM and EDAC 200 mM in water. After

5 min the activating solution was replaced by a streptavidin solution 200 g/ml in acetate buffer 10 mM, pH 5. After 20 min, the residual reacting sites were blocked with a solution of ethanolamine hydrochloride. The crystal surface was washed with the immobilisation buffer and then 200 l of the biotinylated aptamer 1.0 M, were added in the cell. The aptamer was left in contact with the surface for 20 min, then washed off and replaced with 200 l of buffer. 2.3.2. Antibody anti-Tat immobilisation The antibody was covalently attached to dextran modified surface--200 l of a solution 50 ppm of anti-Tat antibody were added after the activation of dextran with NHS/EDAC. After 20 min the antibody solution was washed off and the remaining activated sites of the dextran layer were saturated with ethanolamine as described in paragraph 2.3.1. 2.4. Affinity interaction 2.4.1. Tat-aptamer interaction 100 l of Tat protein at different concentrations were added to the cell and left in contact with the immobilised aptamer for 15 min. The surface was then washed with buffer to remove the unbound protein. The analytical data, expressed as frequency shift, were differences in frequency of the crystal before the addition of Tat and after the washing with buffer subsequent to the affinity interaction. After each measurement, the crystal surface was regenerated with solutions containing different percentages of NaOH and EtOH, for 1 min (2 cycles of 30 s). 2.4.2. Tat-anti-Tat antibody interaction Tat was added in the cell (100 l) and the interaction between the protein and the immobilised antibody was allowed to proceed for 15 min. The surface was then washed with buffer and the frequency was recorded to calculate the frequency shift. After each measurement the surface was regenerated for 1 min (2 cycles of 30 s) with the same solutions used for the aptamer-based sensor.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Aptamer-based sensor The biotinylated aptamer was immobilised as reported in Section 2.3.1. Ten crystals were modified following the described procedure and the frequency shifts due to the aptamer immobilisation were recorded. On four of these crystals, the frequency shift due to the immobilisation of the aptamer was not observed. On the other six crystals, an average value of 26 ± 20 Hz was obtained for the crystal modification, indicating a very low reproducibility for the aptamer immobilisation step.

Only on these last six crystals, the interaction between the immobilised aptamer and Tat protein in a concentration range 0­5 ppm was studied. In Fig. 2 the calibration curve obtained on one crystal is reported: a linear range between 0 and 2.5 ppm and an experimental limit of detection of 0.65 ppm can be observed. The reproducibility in terms of average coefficient variation (CV%), for all the concentration tested in triplicate, was of 14%. The CV% among different crystals (n = 6) was of 21%. This low reproducibility found for the affinity interaction between Tat and the aptamer can be probably related to the irreproducibility of the immobilisation step. To test the specificity of the aptamer, different proteins, differing in molecular weight and in isoelectric point, were used--BCL-2, hIgG and HIV Rev. These proteins were chosen to cover the range of possible interfering molecules in the detection of Tat: hIgG (like BSA contained in the buffer) has a very high molecular weight with respect to Tat, whereas BCL-2 was used to check the effect of a smaller protein, with a molecular weight similar to Tat. Rev represents the closer molecule to the analyte Tat having the same molecular weight and being an RNA-binding protein as well due to its basic domain. 0.65 ppm was chosen as concentration for testing these proteins since at this concentration the specific signal for Tat resulted in a lower CV% (10%). These experiments (Fig. 3) demonstrated the high specificity of the sensor with the immobilised aptamer as a frequency shift (19 ± 2 Hz) was obtained only when testing the specific protein (Tat). In order to improve the reproducibility both for the immobilisation of the receptor and for the interaction between the aptamer and Tat protein, the aptamer has been thermally treated before the immobilisation. This treatment can unfold the aptamer RNA strand making the biotin label at the 5 end available for the interaction with streptavidin on the crystal surface. Before the immobilisation, the biotinylated aptamer was heated at 90  C for 1 min to unfold the RNA strand and then cooled in ice for 10 min in order to block the RNA in its unfolded structure (Ducongè et al., 2000).

different crystals were modified with this treated aptamer and the frequency shift due to the immobilisation step was recorded. An average value (n = 6) of 63 ± 10 Hz was obtained, confirming the efficacy of the thermal treatment on the aptamer in significantly improving the reproducibility of this step (CV% = 16). Considering the frequency shift resulting from the immobilisation of the aptamer, the density of immobilised aptamer can be estimated to be around 0.5 ng/mm2 . The interaction between the aptamer, immobilised after the thermal treatment, and Tat has been studied and the calibration curve is reported in Fig. 4 in comparison with the one related to a crystal modified with the non-treated aptamer. In the case of the thermally treated aptamer a reduced
90

range of linearity can be observed (0­1.25 ppm), but with a lower experimental limit of detection (0.25 ppm). A better reproducibility (CV% = 6) for the interaction between the treated aptamer and Tat was obtained (each concentration tested in triplicate) on one crystal. The reproducibility was improved (CV% = 8) also among different crystals (n = 6). The response of the sensor to blank solutions was tested. Experiments were performed using a solution containing only BSA 0.1% in binding buffer, without Tat. The interaction between this solution and the immobilised aptamer did not generate any signal. Moreover, the solution in which the protein was provided (0.2 M KCl and 5 mM glutathione) has been diluted in binding buffer 2, 10 and 25 times. No signal was obtained also in this case. The selectivity of the sensor was studied testing Rev protein which can be considered as the major interfering protein for the system and hIgG, which has a higher molecular weight compared to Tat. Two different concentrations of Rev protein, 0.65 and 2.5 ppm, were tested. The signals recorded were 5 ± 1 and 12 ± 1 Hz, respectively. On the same crystal, measurements were performed with hIgG 0.65 ppm and 1.25 ppm, obtaining signals of 5 ± 1 and 6 ± 1 Hz. These experiments confirmed the selectivity of the aptamer versus Tat protein, also after the thermal treatment. The sensitivity and reproducibility obtained with the crystal modified with the thermally treated aptamer, together with the high selectivity demonstrated by testing negative controls, indicate that the unfolded aptamer was not negatively affected, in its specificity and efficiency of binding, by the thermal treatment. Actually, this treatment seems to unfold the aptamer before the immobilisation,

leaving the biotin free to bind to the immobilised streptavidin, but not to prevent the re-folding of the aptamer in its secondary structure after the immobilisation on the crystal. The behaviour of Tat analyte versus control surfaces, carrying a different oligonucleotide (poly(T)) and also without any probe was studied. PolyT was chosen to check the possible non-specific effect due to the mere electrostatic interaction between the basic protein Tat and the negatively charged immobilised nucleic acid. Negative control experiments were conducted testing Tat protein on the crystal modified with only streptavidin without the aptamer or with a biotinylated DNA oligonucleotide (polyT) immobilised on streptavidin (Section 2.1). In the first case, the measurements performed with two concentrations of Tat and Rev (0.65 and 1.25 ppm) did not result in a measurable frequency shift. This indicates that the frequency shift due to the interaction between Tat and the immobilised aptamer was not due to the non-specific adsorption of the protein onto the coating layers under the aptamer (i.e. streptavidin). With polyT immobilised on streptavidin, a frequency shift could be detected (20 ± 9 Hz), when using Tat 1.25 ppm. The interaction between the immobilised polyT and Tat (1.25 ppm) produced a frequency shift which was the 35% of the signal obtained from the same concentration of Tat on the aptamer. This was probably due to the electrostatic interaction between the two molecules (Tat and polyT). The high CV% (45%) corresponding to this interaction, was drastically reduced when considering the binding of Tat to the specific aptamer (2%) demonstrating that the contribution to the binding of the mere electrostatic interaction is reduced

when considering the selected aptamer with its secondary structure. 3.1.1. Regeneration of sensor surface After each measurement the surface was regenerated in order to allow a further interaction between the immobilised aptamer and the protein. The first solution used for the regeneration (30 s) contained SDS 0.1% to denature the protein and remove it from the aptamer. This kind of regeneration solution revealed to be not efficient as it required more than five subsequent steps of 30 s to give a complete regeneration. Better results were obtained by using solutions with different contents of NaOH and EtOH. In particular, a solution 12 mM NaOH with 1.2% EtOH allowed a complete regeneration with only two steps of 30 s. After the regeneration step the frequency reached a stable value (±1 Hz) with buffer after 5 min, and a new interaction step could be performed. The time needed for the whole measurement (baseline, interaction, washing, regeneration, and new baseline) was of 25 min. In general, on the same crystal surface, 15 measurements could be performed without losing in sensitivity. In Fig. 5, the trend of the baseline during nine cycles of interaction/regeneration is reported. The values in the figure correspond to the difference between the baseline frequency after each regeneration and the first baseline value before the first cycle of interaction between the immobilised aptamer and Tat. In Table 1 the results obtained for the measurements with Tat at two concentrations (0.65 and 1.25 ppm) are reported in the order in which they have been performed on the crystal. Table 1 and Fig. 5 are relative to the same crystal. These results demonstrate that the regeneration with NaOH

12 mM and 1.2% EtOH did not damage the immobilised aptamer, since the baseline value was not changing during consecutive cycles ( F respect to the first one <5 Hz for all the cycles) and a very good reproducibility was obtained for Tat interaction during these cycles (CV% = 5 and 3% for Tat 0.65 and 1.25 ppm, respectively). 3.2. Antibody-based sensor The immunosensor for Tat protein was realised with the specific monoclonal antibody anti-Tat, immobilised on the sensor following the procedure described in Section 2.3.2. The same concentrations of Tat used for the aptasensor were tested. The calibration curve is reported in Fig. 6: a linear range can be observed between 0 and 2.5 ppm with an experimental detection limit of detection of 0.25 ppm. The reproducibility expressed as average CV% for all the concentrations tested in triplicate was 6% on the same crystal and 7% among different crystals (n = 6). The antigen/antibody interaction was followed by the regeneration step, with the same solution used for the aptasensor, 12 mM NaOH with 1.2% EtOH (3.1.1). On each crystal, 15 measurements can be performed without losing in sensitivity (data not shown). The specificity of the immunosensor was tested with Rev protein at two different concentrations (0.65 and 2.5 ppm). The signals obtained from the interaction with the immobilised antibody were of 5 ± 1 and 12 ± 1 Hz (Fig. 7), respectively. The two receptors, aptamer and antibody, have been compared considering the corresponding calibration curves, reported in Figs. 4 and 6, respectively.

Fig. 7. Specificity of the immunosensor. Tat (0.25­2.5 ppm) and Rev (0.65 and 2.5 ppm) were tested diluted in the same buffer (binding buffer + BSA 0.1%) (interaction time: 15 min).

Both receptors detected Tat protein at a minimum concentration of 0.25 ppm, and the frequency shifts at this concentration were 13 ± 1 and 8 ± 1 Hz for the aptamer and the antibody, respectively. The linear range with the antibody (0­2.5 ppm) was extended compared to that of the aptamer (0­1.25 ppm), but a lower sensitivity could be observed. The reproducibility of the two sensors is comparable (CV% = 6%). Injections of several negative controls at different concentrations generated no signal in both cases. The comparison of the developed aptasensor with other Tat detection methods is very difficult since most of the published papers on this subject, deal with Tat-derived peptides and not with the full length protein. Anyway, the results demonstrated that the use of a biosensor with a specific aptamer as bio-recognition element could be an interesting approach in the detection of proteins, which has been here examined considering a model system.

4. Conclusions This work demonstrated the potential role of aptamers as bio-recognition elements in affinity sensing. This model system was based on an RNA aptamer specific for HIV-1 Tat protein. The developed aptasensor proved to be specific, reproducible and reusable in the detection of Tat protein. In paral-

lel, an immunosensor specific for the same analyte has been developed and used as reference affinity methodology. Both the biosensors did not reach the sensitivity necessary for the detection of Tat in real samples, such as sera or cell culture supernatants, but the work suggests that the use of aptamers as bio-recognition element can be an interesting approach for the development of a new generation of biosensors.
