CIN85 is a multifunctional protein that plays key roles in endocytic down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and cytoskeleton rearrangement. Its three SH3 domains (CIN85A, CIN85B, and CIN85C) allow it to recruit multiple binding partners. To understand the manifold interactions of CIN85, we present a detailed high-resolution solution structural study of CIN85A and CIN85B binding to proline­arginine peptides derived from the cognate ligands Cbl and Cbl-b. We report the structure of CIN85B and provide evidence that both CIN85A and CIN85B, in isolation or when linked, form heterodimeric complexes with the peptides. We report unusual curved chemical shift changes for several residues of CIN85A when titrated with Cbl-b peptide, indicating the existence of more than one complex form. Here we demonstrate that CIN85A and CIN85B use different mechanisms for peptide binding.

Introduction
The 85-kDa human Cbl-interacting protein CIN85, also known as SETA, Ruk, or SH3KBP1, is an important adaptor protein.1 It is well known to play a key role in down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases and to facilitate endocytosis by interacting with endophilin-associated Cbl proteins.2,3 However, CIN85 has also been implicated in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, via association with the p85 subunit of PI3K and AIP1/Alix,4,5 as well as adhesion and cytoskeletal

rearrangement, via interaction with p130Cas, cortactin, and ASAP1. 6­8 CIN85 is involved in additional important physiological processes such as regulation of cellular stress response via interaction with MEKK4,9 cross-linking of F-actin into bundles,10 and several others.1,11­13 In addition, CIN85 is implicated in infectious diseases via interaction with infected cell protein 0 from herpes simplex virus,14 development of glomerulosclerosis in a diseased mouse model,15 and breast cancer cell invasion via interaction with AMAP1.16 CIN85 interacts with binding partners through its three SH3 domains (via atypical proline-rich motifs based on the sequence PXXXPR, where X is any amino acid), a proline-rich region, and a serine-rich region10,17 (Fig. 1a). The importance of the CIN85 SH3 domains in clustering Cbl proteins has also been reported.17 Although there are several isoforms of CIN85, little is known about their roles in promoting or rescuing activity or in competing with full-length functions5,18 (Fig. 1a). Nonetheless, the full-length protein and the isoform lacking the first SH3 domain show distinct functions.19 CIN85 lacking the first two SH3 domains competes with the intact protein for binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K.5

The SH3 domain is one of the best-characterized interacting modules involved in protein­protein associations.20,21 It binds primarily to proline-rich sequences that generally adopt a PPII helix conformation. Binding of peptides containing proline-rich sequences to SH3 domains can occur in two opposing orientations. The stoichiometry of binding is 1:1, with notable exception of the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox, where a single peptide binds to both SH3 domains.22,23 Recent studies have reported novel binding features of CIN85 SH3 domains. In one of these studies that explored the molecular mechanism of the interaction of CIN85 with the p85 subunit of PI3K, it was proposed that the proline-rich motif from the p85 monomer simultaneously binds to both N-terminal SH3 domain A (referred to as CIN85A) and N-terminal SH3 domain B (referred to as CIN85B).24 Taking into account the long linker between CIN85A and CIN85B (Fig. 1b), such complex formation is plausible. Recently, it was reported that binding of CIN85A to a peptide from Cbl-b results in heterotrimer complex formation between two SH3 domains and one peptide.25 Since the CIN85 SH3 domains are selective for proline-rich motifs of type PXXXPR, it is possible that CIN85B may also form a heterotrimeric complex of the form described for CIN85A.

Taking into account the large number of interacting proteins with CIN85 via its SH3 domains, the existence of several of its isoforms with deletion of one to all SH3 domains, and the recent new binding mode revealed by its SH3 domains, further detailed studies of the CIN85 protein--particularly its SH3 domains--are important. Hence, to explore the structural implications and to understand the functional role of complex formation between CIN85 SH3 domains and proline-rich peptides from c-Cbl and Cbl-b proteins (referred to as Cbl and Cbl-b, respectively), we have initiated a detailed investigation of high-resolution structures and interactions in solution of CIN85A and CIN85B, in isolation and in the context of a CIN85A­linker­CIN85B fragment (referred to as CIN85AB). We report the solution structure of CIN85B. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR spectroscopic experiments demonstrate that both domains, in isolation or as part of CIN85AB, form heterodimeric complexes with both peptides. An unusual curved chemical shift(s) (CS) change for several residues in CIN85A was observed upon titration with Cbl-b. This reveals the existence of more than one complex with CIN85A in isolated form or in the CIN85AB form. Here we report that the mechanisms of binding of CIN85A and CIN85B to both peptides are different and independent of CIN85AB. This suggests that the

1122 SH3 domains of CIN85 have evolved to incorporate different modes of recognition for cognate ligands, providing a level of specificity to achieve its multifunctional capability.

Results
Solution structure of CIN85B and the absence of intramolecular interaction with CIN85A within the CIN85AB fragment The structure of CIN85A was recently reported in complex with Cbl-b.25 It was shown that there

are no substantial structural changes between the apo form and the complex form of CIN85A.26 The structure calculation of CIN85B reported here is based on excellent-quality three-dimensional 15Nand 13C-resolved heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra of a monomeric protein supported by a rotational correlation time of 6.92 ns at a concentration of  0.7 mM. The family of structures shown in Fig. 2a indicates a highly defined structure, supported by a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.27 Å for backbone atoms (see Table S1 in Supplementary Materials). The only regions of disorder are the N- and C-termini, which extend beyond the

SH3 domain. The solution structure of CIN85B maintains a typical SH3 fold consisting of five strands organized in an antiparallel -barrel structure, with a short 310 helix between the last two -strands, and two characteristic loops, namely, the RT loop (between 1 and 2) and the n-Src loop (between 2 and 3), as shown in Fig. 2b. Sequence alignment of CIN85A and CIN85B shows about 47% identity. The residues in the binding pocket are highly conserved, but some notable differences are apparent (Fig. 1c, blue and red arrows). Structural alignment of CIN85B with the crystal structure of CIN85A in complex with Cbl-b shows significant differences in the RT and n-Src loop regions and an overall rmsd of 3 Å.25 Backbone assignment of polypeptides provides a direct assessment of the existence of any intramolecular interactions between CIN85A and CIN85B within CIN85AB. Overlay of the 1H­15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the isolated domains with that of CIN85AB shows a reasonable match (Fig. 2c). CIN85A has about 20 (small to substantial) unmatched resonances. Far better matching is observed between CIN85B and CIN85AB. Unmatched resonances of CIN85A were mapped over the whole domain surface (Fig. 2d). This suggests that no specific intermolecular or intramolecular interaction exists. Thus, these data rule out the possibility of an interaction of the SH3 domains with the PXXP motif (PEKPLHEVP), which is present in the linker region (see Fig. 1b). Such CS changes may be directly related to the removal of the C-terminal His-tag27 and/or the presence of the linker. To control for this, we expressed and purified a new construct without the His-tag (CIN85A_new). The overlay of the 1 H­15N HSQC spectra of the new construct with CIN85AB revealed a very good match, with almost all its resonances within CIN85AB (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Materials). This demonstrates that the presence of the His-tag in the construct of CIN85A can affect the CS of a small number

1124 CIN85A and CIN85B form 1:1 complexes with Cbl and Cbl-b peptides ITC analysis is summarized in Table 1, and use example of typical ITC data for the interaction of the domains with Cbl peptide is shown in Fig. 3. Clearly, the interaction stoichiometry n shows that CIN85A29 and CIN85B form heterodimeric complexes with both peptides. CIN85A and CIN85B titrations with peptides were monitored with 1H­15N HSQC spectra. Most of the residues in the binding site are in a fast-exchange regime. The combined backbone 1H and 15N CS changes between apo and saturated complexes are plotted against the domain sequences in Fig. 4a. For both domains, there are three major groups of residues with substantial CS changes above the tot threshold. These include residues in the RT loop (8­19 and 108­117 for CIN85A and CIN85B, respectively), at the n-Src loop and 3 (32­39 and 128­138, respectively), and near 4 and the 310 helix (48­53 and 145­154, respectively). Upon binding of the peptides, several residues of CIN85B show highly perturbed CS. CIN85A, on the other hand, shows low CS perturbations, except for Asp16 at the RT loop and Asn51 at the 310 helix. These residues form hydrogen bonds with the peptides.25 Residues with CS changes above a tot + 1 threshold are mapped on the domain structures in Fig. 4b. CIN85A and CIN85B binding to Cbl results in linear CS changes in amide and side-chain signals (Fig. 5). For CIN85B binding to Cbl-b, similar CS changes were observed. Surprisingly, CIN85A binding to Cbl-b reveals highly curved and slightly curved CS changes for Phe8, His14, Gly35, Trp36, Asp50, and Asn51. As an illustration of such striking curved CS changes, we show the titrations of the Trp36 side chain in CIN85A (Fig. 5). Interestingly in CIN85B, while the Trp135 side-chain titration with Cbl peptide shows linear CS changes, we observed a double signal set at intermediate concentrations (0.17­0.57 Eq) (Fig. 5). To verify further the stoichiometry of the complexes formed by CIN85A and CIN85B with both peptides in solution, we have determined the rotational correlation times (c) of the apo and complex forms of these domains using NMR relaxation (Table 2). The c values of the apo domains ( 6­ 7 ns) increase in the complexes (8.8­9.0 ns). Note that the CIN85A construct is 10 residues shorter than the CIN85B construct, which may account for the lower c values. Taking into account the anisotropic nature of the complexes due to the disordered termini of both the domains and/or the peptides,30 c values provide strong additional evidence that the CIN85A and CIN85B complexes are monomeric species binding with a 1:1 stoichiometry. CIN85A and CIN85B form independent heterodimer complexes in the context of CIN85AB We have shown that isolated SH3 domains form heterodimeric complexes with Cbl and Cbl-b. These

results prompted us to investigate the complex formation of these domains in the context of CIN85AB. ITC analysis of CIN85AB binding to both peptides is summarized in Table 1. The stoichiometry of these complexes is 1:2, strongly suggesting that CIN85A and CIN85B behave as isolated domains binding one peptide each. CIN85AB titrations with Cbl and Cbl-b, as monitored with 1H­15N HSQC spectra, show CS changes similar to those of the isolated domains (see example in Fig. 5), including the curved CS changes observed for the CIN85A complex with Cbl-b. Overlaying of the 1H­15N HSQC spectra of the proteins in complex with Cbl and Cbl-b peptides shows a very good match between signals of CIN85B and CIN85AB. Again CIN85A shows similar residues with (small to substantial) unmatched signals, as observed with the apo form (Fig. 2; see also Fig. S2a and b in Supplementary Materials). This confirms that several residues in CIN85A have different CS in CIN85AB, mainly due to effect of the His-tag27 (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Materials) and/or the prolines of the linker in terms of backbone rigidity, but are unlikely to arise from any intramolecular interaction as previously reported for an SH3 domain with a proline-rich linker.31 In addition, to further verify the stoichiometry of the complexes formed by CIN85A and CIN85B with both peptides within CIN85AB, we have determined the rotational correlation times (c) of the apo and complex forms of these domains in CIN85AB (Table 2). The c values of the apo domains in CIN85AB ( 6.8­7.3 ns) increase in the complexes ( 8.4­8.8 ns) and are indicative of the independent behavior of these domains within CIN85AB. These observations confirm that CIN85A and CIN85B form heterodimer complexes with both peptides in the context of CIN85AB and behave independently within the apo and complex forms of CIN85AB. Interestingly, residues that showed slightly curved CS changes for CIN85A in complex with Cbl-b have highly curved CS changes in CIN85AB in complex with Cblb (see examples in Fig. 6). CIN85A and CIN85B bind differently to Cbl and Cbl-b peptides The binding affinities between the two peptides are different for CIN85A, but are similar for CIN85B. CIN85B has a more favorable change in enthalpy, Hobs, for binding than CIN85A, suggesting the existence of clear differences in peptide recognition between these domains. These differences are intriguing because the peptides have similar binding core motifs PXXXPR, and both domains have similar binding sites with conserved residues (Fig. 1c). In addition, our NMR titrations reveal the unusual curved CS changes in several residues of CIN85A in complex with Cbl-b, but not with Cbl, while no such curved changes are observed for CIN85B with either peptide (Fig. 5). Comparison of Cbl and Cbl-b shows that Ala903 and Arg909 in Cbl-b are replaced by Glu821 and Phe827 in Cbl. To rationalize the

difference in the binding affinities of CIN85A for these peptides in structural terms, we mutated these residues in the Cbl-b peptide (since this complex has been characterized25). We will refer to the peptide mutants of Cbl-b as Cbl-b(F) and Cbl-b(E) for mutants Arg909-Phe and Ala903-Glu, respectively. CIN85B binds with similar affinity and thermodynamic parameters to both Cbl-b(F) and Cbl-b(E) (Table 1). Surprisingly, CIN85A shows comparable binding affinities between Cbl and Cbl-b(F), as well as between Cbl-b and Cbl-b(E). NMR titrations reveal unexpected effects of these mutations upon binding to CIN85A and CIN85B. Titrations with Cbl-b(F) and Cbl-b(E) do not change the binding behavior of CIN85B (Figs. 4c and 5). Indeed, the Trp135 side-chain titration with Cbl-b(F) resulted in linear CS changes, with a doublet signal observed only at intermediate concentrations (Fig. 5). This is due to the presence of Phe827 in Cbl, since mutation of Arg909 to Phe in Cbl-b resulted in similar behavior, as observed with Cbl. SH3 domains bind to proline-rich peptides using this conserved Trp, which makes a hydrogen bond with the peptide backbone. Although it has been proposed that this Trp could dictate the peptide binding orientation through a different orientation of its side chain,32 such a small change in side-chain conformation is unlikely to affect the Trp135 side-chain signal. Instead, we suggest that the Phe residue in Cbl or Cbl-b(F) exchanges slowly between two transient conformers detected only at intermediate concentra-

tions. Indeed, at intermediate concentrations, the binding rates may be affected, hence indicating the presence of other conformational states of the interacting residues.33 Titration of CIN85A with Cbl-b(E) produced the same unusual curved CS changes for residues as in Cbl-b titration; however, Cbl-b(F) abrogates this effect (Fig. 5). These results show that Arg909 (underlined in PXXXPR) has a critical role in giving rise to the observed unusual curved CS changes in CIN85A signals for Cbl-b binding. This is intriguing because our mutants do not affect Arg911, which was shown to be an important residue for binding with CIN85,17,34 or Arg904, which has been reported to be crucial for peptide-induced dimerization.25 Instead, our mutants have kept the pseudo-symmetry of the binding core motif of Cbl-b as RPPXXXPR.

Discussion
CIN85A forms more than one heterodimer complex with Cbl-b, but not with Cbl We have provided evidence that in solution, CIN85A forms a heterodimeric complex with both Cbl and Cbl-b. Interestingly, the NMR titration of CIN85A with Cbl-b shows unusual curved CS changes for several residues (Fig. 5). Nonlinear CS changes have been previously reported;35­37 however, to our knowledge, curved CS changes have

only been reported in proteins for the temperature dependence of the amide signals.38 The CS change curvature was suggested to originate from alternative protein folding states.38 SH3 domains bind proline-rich peptides without any obvious change in their folding states. Consequently, since linear CS changes are the hallmarks of the formation of one highly populated complex, to explain the origin of our curved CS changes, we have to consider the existence of more than one complex population in solution (Fig. 7a). A one-dimensional (1D) lineshapes simulation in the fast-exchange regime between two

states shows that lineshapes will shift only in one direction toward the final complex (data not shown). Inspection of the 1H 1D spectra of Trp36 side-chain titration reveals that lineshapes shift in one direction up to  0.5 Eq and then shift in the opposite direction (Fig. 7b). Curved CS changes are only likely to be observed when the CS in these states is largely different. The most likely way to produce such CS differences will be through change in hydrogen bonding.39,40 Hydrogen bonds are affected by the electronic structure of the residues involved in their formation and by proximal amino acids.41 The X-ray

structure of CIN85A with Cbl-b shows that the peptide can bind in two orientations, 25 creating two different hydrogen bonds with the Trp36 side chain (Fig. 7c). These hydrogen bonds are to the peptide backbone; however, the side chain of the interacting residue changes from proline to arginine, depending on the orientation (Fig. 7c). Consequently, the existence of two complexes (complexes 1 and 2) with Cbl-b, with similar free energies of formation in solution, is possible and could result in large CS differences. This does not exclude the existence of other complex forms. Simulations with the condition that the population of complex 1 increases during the titrations using a three-state model (apo, complex 1, and complex 2 forms) successfully provides a mimic of the experimental lineshapes shift (Fig. 7d). Hence, our simulations reveal that at least two complexes can exist between CIN85A and Cbl-b in solution, and suggest that the interactions have moderate and comparable affinities. However, we still need to know the oligomeric state of these complexes (i.e.,

heterodimer and/or heterotrimer). We have fitted the curved CS of Trp36 side-chain data using two binding models, considering only two heterodimers (model 1), or using one heterotrimer and one heterodimer (model 2). The data fit with model 1 was good and provides two Kd values of  37 and 62 M, while the data fit with model 2 was not so good, with the best fit calculating Kd values of  0.1 and 5 M for the heterotrimer and heterodimer, respectively (Fig. 7e and f). For comparison, the data fit for linear CS changes in Asp16 results in a Kd of 51 M (data not shown). Thus, model 1 provides consistent Kd values in line with the requirement for comparable affinities between the two complexes. Model 2 is thus not realistic, since the heterotrimer would be the final complex due to the 50-fold difference between the affinities. In addition, we have simulated the 1D spectra of CIN85A titration with Cbl-b (Fig. 7b) using reaction Scheme 1. Where complexes 1 and 2 are as described above, kon and koff values are the respective on-rate and off-

rate constants for each complex. Figure 8 shows that the lineshapes can be well described by this mechanism scheme. The values for the rate constants obtained from the simulated lineshapes were 4.0 × 10 8 M- 1s- 1 and 117 s- 1 for k on1 and koff1, respectively, and 3.4 × 10 8 M- 1s- 1 and 310 s- 1 for k on2 and koff2, respectively. Interestingly, while the kon values were nearly similar for the complexes, the koff values were different by a factor of 2.65. Furthermore, the calculated Kd values are in a similar range of 0.3 and 0.9 M for complexes 1 and 2, respectively, in line with those obtained from the fitting data of model 1 (37 and 62 M). A detailed kinetic analysis of the interactions of domains of Cin85 will be presented elsewhere. Experimentally, the c values for the apo and saturated complexes of CIN85A with Cbl-b were clearly consistent with monomeric CIN85A species (Table 2); however, to clarify the oligomeric state of the complex in solution, we investigated the complex formation at low and intermediate concentrations. We determined c of CIN85A in the presence of Cbl-b at 0.12, 0.25, and 0.55 Eq (Fig. 7g). The c values are consistent with monomeric species of CIN85A, since as Cbl-b concentration increases, it seems that there is only an averaging of c between the apo form and the heterodimer form. Since our th calculated theoretical c (c ) of the heterotrimer is th  14.2 ns (for the apo and heterodimer forms, the c 42 values were 6.2 and 8.3 ns, respectively), if it existed in solution over this Cbl-b concentration range, values higher than those reported here would be observed (Fig. 7g). This clearly shows that during the course of complex formation, only the heterodimeric complexes exist. The binding of CIN85A to Cbl-b(F) results in the formation of one heterodimeric complex population, similar to the binding of Cbl (Fig. 5). Thus, it is

intriguing that the presence of Arg909 seems to play a major role in the formation of another complex despite the fact that its side chain does not appear to form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with CIN85A residues in the crystal structure.25 Hence, for the first time, we report the importance of the Arg909 residue in complex formation between CIN85A and Cbl-b. At present, it is difficult to provide experimental evidence to interpret this observation; however, an explanation is possible if we assume that Arg909 forms hydrogen bonds with CIN85A residues in solution. Indeed, Arg909 side chain may form hydrogen bonds with Asn51 and Glu7 (crystal structure complex A) or Asp33 and Asp50 (complex B), depending on the peptide orientation, as revealed by our energy-minimized structures 25 (Fig. 7c). This shows the potential of Arg909 to create at least two different complex states using different hydrogen bonding networks. Thus, the Phe mutation will abolish these hydrogen bonds, resulting in one highly populated complex (Fig. 5). CIN85A and CIN85B bind peptides with different binding mechanisms CIN85A and CIN85B have a sequence similarity of  47% and similar binding sites. Although CIN85A and CIN85B form heterodimeric complexes with Cbl and Cbl-b in solution, their binding mechanisms are strikingly dissimilar. First, we observe differences in binding affinities and Hobs for the interaction of the domains with peptides sharing similar binding core motifs and pseudo-symmetries (Table 1). Second, there is a different pattern in CS perturbations of the domains upon binding (Fig. 4). CIN85A shows low CS perturbations in comparison to CIN85B, except for Asp16 and Asn51, and no substantial difference between the peptides, except

1132 for small changes at the acidic pocket (Fig. 4). Change in the extent of CS perturbations is well correlated to the binding affinity.43 However, the small increase in CS perturbations in the acidic pocket observed with CIN85A could not account for the affinity differences on complex formation between these peptides. CIN85B, on the other hand, shows higher CS perturbations upon binding and a substantial decrease in the CS perturbations for Cbl-b binding at several residues (Fig. 4). This decrease could be correlated to the very small reduction in the binding affinity of Cbl-b. The mapping of residues above the tot + 1 threshold shows that CIN85B has a far higher number of residues interacting with the peptide than CIN85A (Fig. 4). This suggests that CIN85A has a `preformed' binding site, while in CIN85B, there is substantial side-chain rearrangement within the binding site and more distal residues. Comparison of the structures of the apo N-terminal SH3 domain of CMS (CMSA) to those of CIN85A in complex with Cbl-b shows no conformational changes in the n-Src or RT loops upon binding26 (CMS and CIN85 have similar domain compositions with 54% similarity in amino acid sequence and similar proposed functions 1 ). Furthermore, structural overlap of the CIN85A monomers of the heterotrimer complex with Cbl-b shows a very low backbone rmsd of 0.11 Å and, importantly, the side-chain conformations of all residues in the binding site are identical.25 This is in line with the observed CS perturbation pattern for CIN85A. Third, several residues of CIN85A involved in the binding of Cbl-b show curved CS changes, while CIN85B residues do not. We have provided evidence that at least two heterodimer complexes of CIN85A form in solution (Fig. 7). A plausible way for this to happen is when binding takes the form of rigid-body docking, especially when the ligand has certain molecular symmetry. Fourth, the difference between c of apo CIN85A and that with either Cbl or Cbl-b complexes (c) is slightly higher by  0.3 ns compared to c for CIN85B (Table 2). Only binding with looserfitting peptides at the binding site would give rise to such an increase in c. The X-ray structure of CIN85A in complex with Cbl-b shows that monomer B has far less contact with Cbl-b than monomer A, and the electron density for three residues at either termini of Cbl-b is absent. 25 In contrast, CIN85B in complex with both peptides shows resonances matching those of CIN85AB (see Fig. S1a and b in Supplementary Materials). This is consistent with binding via an induced fit of CIN85B in isolation or as part of CIN85AB. These observations suggest that CIN85A binds to the peptides with a rigid-body mechanism while CIN85B uses an induced-fit mechanism. Behavior of CIN85 SH3 domains in solution and in vivo implications A large and increasing number of binding partners have been identified for CIN85, emphasizing the

multifunctional role of this protein. The majority of these interactions involve its SH3 domains.1,7,13,16 Recent X-ray structures of both CIN85A and CMSA have revealed heterotrimeric complex formation with Cbl-b.25,26 Consequently, it was suggested that these heterotrimer complexes are important in the clustering of Cbl proteins in vivo.25,26 We show that in solution, CIN85A and CIN85B form 1:1 complexes with Cbl and Cbl-b peptides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CIN85A is able to form at least two complexes in solution with Cbl-b through a rigid-body binding mechanism. Hence, it is possible that the reported crystal structures of the heterotrimer complex represent a `trapping' of two CIN85A molecules binding to one Cbl-b. This view is supported by the observation of both heterodimeric and heterotrimeric complex structures in two different crystals of the CMSA, with the CD2 peptide containing the PXXXPR motif.26 Another complex between the SH3 domain from cortactin and AMAP1 peptide containing a PXXXPR motif was reported to be a heterotrimer in crystals.44 Our results, as well as previously reported data,17 clearly suggest that the observed crystal heterotrimer complexes are not physiologically relevant. First, Cbl proteins are known to homodimerize at their UBA/ LZ domain.45 Our Cbl-b peptide motif is located very close to the UBA/LZ domain, so that it is unlikely that heterotrimer formation is able to take place due to steric constraints. Second, in vivo CIN85 exists as a dimer and/or a tetramer. This is likely to add additional molecular constraints to the formation of a possible trimeric complex with the intact Cbl-b protein, particularly while the latter is engaged in other protein complexes.46 Third, in vivo experiments have often not mimicked physiological conditions. For example, deletion mutants of CIN85 containing only the three SH3 domains are shown to interact efficiently with proteins such as MEKK4, p85, and Cbl; however, in the context of the fulllength protein, the interaction is less efficient.9,19,24 In addition, in vivo experiments often fail to reproduce the effect of the C-terminal phosphorylation of Cbl-b on CIN85 binding.47 Finally, an interesting interaction mechanism between CIN85 and p85 has been suggested to involve CIN85A and CIN85B binding to the same proline-rich motif PXXXPR of p85.24 Although the peptide sequence is different from Cbl-b and Cbl peptides, our results in solution show clearly that CIN85AB binds to these peptides similarly as the isolated domains. Although the linker between the domains in CIN85AB is long, the presence of four prolines (Fig. 1b) near CIN85A may exist to prevent CIN85A and CIN85B from binding the same motif in vivo.

Conclusion
We have provided evidence that, in solution, the first two SH3 domains of CIN85 form heterodimers with Cbl and Cbl-b peptides in either isolated

individual interactions was not possible at the experimental temperature. NMR spectroscopy NMR data were collected with 0.5­0.8 mM protein samples containing 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.3), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 0.01% NaN3. Each sample was prepared in 95% (vol/vol) H2O/5% D2O. NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on either a 600-MHz Bruker AVANCE DRX spectrometer, a 500-MHz Varian Unity Plus spectrometer, or a 600-MHz Varian Inova spectrometer. The 1H, 15N, and 13C assignments were made as previously reported.43 Relaxation analysis was performed by measuring 15N R1, R2, and 1H­15N heteronuclear NOE experiments on 15N-labeled CIN85A, CIN85B, and CIN85AB protein samples at 0.35­0.65 mM protein concentrations at 25 °C and analyzed as previously reported.43 For CIN85A and CIN85B, R1 was measured with delays of 51, 202, 302, 403 (twice), 503, 603, 805, 1006, 1408, and 1810 ms, and R2 was measured with delays of 16, 31, 47, 62 (twice), 94, 125, 156, 187, 219, and 250 ms. For CIN85AB, R1 was measured with delays of 16, 48, 96, 192, 288 (twice), 384, 512, 704, 960, and 1200 ms, and R2 was measured with delays of 5.1, 10.3, 15.4, 20.5 (twice), 30.8, 41.0, 61.5, 82.0, 112.8, and 143.5 ms. Heteronuclear NOE was measured with a proton saturation period of 3 s. We collected total data points of 18­20 steps for each NMR titration of the proteins with the peptides. To calculate the total average change in backbone amide 1H and 15N CS for each resonance, the following equation was applied:  tot = {[0.17( 15 N)] 2 + [ (1H)]2}1/2, where (15N) and (1H) are the CS changes. The change in total CS was then calculated for each identified residue, with the exception of those whose resonances had broadened past detectability in the 1H­15N HSQC NMR spectra. The average total CS tot and standard deviation 1 associated with each data set were also calculated. The NMR simulations of exchanging lineshapes were performed using WINDNMR software (by Dr. Hans J. Reich); however, we used programs written in Mathematica (Wolfram Research) for simulations in slowexchange regime for comparison. The equations adopted for the two-state model calculations were previously described.48 For the three-state model, the Kubo­Sack matrix approach was used to simulate the lineshapes.49 We performed extensive tests to show that the large differences in CS between different complex states dictate the extent of curvature of the CS changes observed during the titration in our NMR simulations. The data fit of the curved CS changes was performed for model 1 (competition between two heterodimer complexes) using the equation:  = i = 1,2i,min + (i,max - i,min)[((L + Kdi + P) - ((L + Kdi + P)2 - 4LP))1/2]/2P, where L and P are the total concentrations of the ligand and protein, respectively, and Kdi is the dissociation constant for each heterodimer. For model 2 (competition between heterotrimer and heterodimer complexes), we have used Mathematica to solve the system of equations: K1 = LP2/T, K2 = LP/D, Ptot = P + 2T + D, and Ltot = L + T + D, where Ptot and Ltot are the total concentrations of the protein and the ligand. L, P, D, and T are the free concentrations of the ligand, protein, dimer, and trimer, respectively. We then implemented a fitting routine where we substituted the solutions for T and D into the equation:  = (T/Ptot)T + ((Ptot - T - D)/Ptot)P + (D/Ptot)D, where T, P, and D are the CS of the trimer, free protein, and dimer, respectively.

(CIN85A and CIN85B) or linked forms (CIN85AB). We have shown that these domains bind to the peptides using different binding mechanisms, namely, a rigid-body mechanism for CIN85A and an induced fit for CIN85B. For the first time, we have reported for an SH3 domain unusual curved CS changes during the binding of Cbl-b peptide to CIN85A, revealing the existence of at least two heterodimer complexes. We have correlated our results with the in vivo implications for CIN85 functions. In summary, the manifold function of CIN85 is dominated by discrete interactions of its SH3 domains. They exhibit clear differences in their mechanism of recognition of Cbl proteins, which have been reported to have different functions (see review by Schmidt and Dikic46) and therefore provide the potential for specific recognition and independent function of the domains.

Materials and Methods
Protein preparation All protein constructs were cloned into the pET21b vector and verified by DNA sequencing. These were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) at 37 °C. The proteins were purified using similar protocols, as described previously.43 CIN85AB, however, was expressed in inclusion bodies, so the cell pellet was washed with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0), 70 mM NaCl, 5 mM mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The pellet was then dissolved and homogenized in the same buffer with 8 M urea without Triton X-100. Cell debris was then spun, and the supernatant was collected for protein refolding. The latter was achieved by successive dialysis in the ureacontaining buffer at 4 M urea, 2 M urea, and, finally, 0 M urea. CIN85AB protein was then purified using the same protocol as the other soluble polypeptides. Isotopeenriched samples of all proteins were obtained by growing the bacteria in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 15 N-ammonium chloride (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and/or uniformly 13C-enriched glucose as the unique sources of nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Isothermal titration calorimetry Titrations were carried out on a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). The peptides were cCbl (or Cbl), SQVPERPPKPFPRRINSY, and Cbl-b, SQAPARPPKPRPRRTAY. The C-terminal tyrosines were introduced for concentration determination, and bold letters represent residues that were mutated, as described in the text. CIN85A, CIN85B, and CIN85AB (20­50 M) were titrated with the peptides (500­1000 M) in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 50 mM NaCl at 25 °C. The titrations consisted of a preliminary 2-l injection (neglected in data analysis), followed by 24 subsequent 12-l injections. Four minutes were left between each injection. Binding data were corrected by subtraction of the mean value of the heat of dilution data. Corrected binding data were processed using the Origin ITC analysis software package supplied by MicroCal, Inc. The similarity of the affinities of the two independent binding events on binding of peptides to CIN85AB meant that deconvolution of the data for the

1134
Lineshape analysis was achieved using Bloch equations for a three-state exchanging system according to Scheme 1 (see Discussion) and prepared as a system of coupled equations as described previously 50 and solved in Mathematica using the DSolve function. A series of seven free induction decays for the titration was calculated for an acquisition time of 1.0 s and a dwell time of 100 s, followed by Fourier transformation for a comparison of simulated with experimental spectra.51 CS for the free protein (41.5 Hz) and complex 1 (52.2 Hz), as well as the intrinsic linewidths for these species (30 and 40.0 s- 1, respectively), were fixed as obtained from the first and last steps of the titration, while the CS of complex 2, the four kinetic constants, and the intrinsic linewidth of complex 2 were optimized to best reproduce the experimental data. Simulated and recorded spectra are displayed superimposed as suggested previously.51,52 Structure calculation We performed simulated annealing molecular dynamics using ARIA protocol (version 1.2),53 as previously reported.43 A total of 315 unambiguous proton­proton distances from NOESY spectra were used as a starting set of distance constraints together with 15 hydrogen bond constraints for protons in residues having appropriate sheet-specific interstrand NOEs and 70  and  dihedral angle constraints from CS analysis by TALOS.54 Dihedral restraints were only added for residues that had a substantial number of NOE distances and were thus assumed to be in a well-defined conformation. Unassigned NOEs (totaling 2275) from three-dimensional 15N and 13C NOESY-HSQC experiments were introduced as ambiguous distance constraints. After eight cycles of ARIA, 1323 of these were unambiguously assigned. After the final iteration, structures with no violation of NOE constraints above 0.5 Å were selected. A total of 27 structures fulfilled this criterion. 7.
