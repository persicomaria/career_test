The X-ray structure analysis of a cross-linked crystal of concanavalin A soaked with a hexapeptide molecule as a probe molecule showed an electron density corresponding to full occupation in the binding pocket. The site lies on the surface of concanavalin A and is surrounded by three symmetryrelated molecules. The crystal structure of the hexapeptide complex was refined at 1.93-Å resolution, to an R-factor of 19% (Rfree factor of 25%), with an RMS deviation in bond distances of 0.01 Å. The model includes all 237 residues of concanavalin A, one manganese ion, one calcium ion, 95 water molecules, one glutaraldehyde molecule, one isopropanol molecule, and one hexapeptide molecule. This X-ray structure analysis also provides an approach to mapping the binding surface of crystalline protein with a probe molecule that is dissolved in the mixture of organic solvent with water or in neat organic solvent but is hardly dissolved in aqueous solution.
KEY WORDS: Concanavalin A; hexapeptide; X-ray structure.

1. INTRODUCTION As proteins are generally not stable in most organic solvents, a crystal of a given protein has to be lightly crosslinked with glutaraldehyde before being transferred into organic solvents. For example, for probing the protein surface to understand the structure factor involved in nonaqueous catalysis (Klibanov, 1989), the structure of glutaraldehyde-cross-linked crystals of subtilisin in acetonitrile (Fitzpatrick et al., 1993) has been reported. In another example, an experiment focused on the development of a new drug design methodology named the method of multiple solvent crystal structure to probed the entire surface of the target protein (Allen et al., 1996) by solving the crystal structure of the protein in organic solvents. In a previous article, we reported the crystal structure of the complex of concanavalin A with a tripeptide YPY dissolved in mixtures of organic solvent with

water, which is the consensus sequence shared by most peptides that can bind concanavalin A. The crystal of concanavalin A was stabilized by cross-linking before being transferred into the mixture of organic solvent with water. Our previous work demonstrated the presence of tripeptide YPY binding concanavalin A at a binding pocket. The results illustrate the experimental approach of mapping the binding surface of a crystalline protein with a probe molecule which is dissolved in mixtures of organic solvent with water or in neat organic solvent. In this paper the hexapeptide MYWYPY is chosen as a probe molecule because hexapeptides and octapeptides can bind concanavalin A as mimics of mannosides (Scott et al., 1992; Oldenburg et al., 1992). Saccharides are important molecules which play a crucial role in communication and recognition within an organism (Sharon and Lis, 1993; Borman, 1993). They have been considered for medical uses, but their synthesis is quite complicated and difficult. At the same time, saccharides have relative weak antigenicity as vaccines. Therefore it would be valuable to find peptide mimics of saccharides. Peptides similar to some saccharides have been found from random peptide libraries. Structural details about the interactions between these molecules will be very 423

424 helpful not only for medicine but also for research on small molecule diversity. With the approach mentioned above, the crystal structure of the complex of concanavalin A with the hexapeptide MYWYPY has been determined at high resolution (1.93 Å). The results confirm that the probe hexapeptide MYWYPY binds with concanavalin A at a binding pocket similar to the tripeptide binding with concanavalin A found in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2001). The binding pocket is different from saccharidebinding sites (Naismith et al., 1994; Kanellopoulos et al., 1996; Naismith and Field, 1996, Hamodrakas et al., 1997) and known nonpolar (Edelman and Wang, 1974) and acetonitrile binding sites (Qian et al., 1998). 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Crystal Preparation Concanavalin A purchased from Shanghai Dongfong Biochemical Company was crystallized in hanging drops by the vapor diffusion method at 25°C (Hardman and Ainsworth, 1972). The lyophilized concanavalin A powder was dissolved in a buffer containing 0.35 mole/L NaCl and 0.01 mole/L Tris­HCl (pH 7.4) at a concentration of 25 mg/ml concanavalin A. The droplets were composed of 3 l of concanavalin A solution and 3 l of 2.2 mole/L aqueous sodium phosphate (pH 5.45), and were equilibrated against an aqueous solution of 2.2 mole/L sodium phosphate. Crystals normally appeared in 3 days and grew to suitable size (0.5 mm 0.4 mm 0.4 mm) in 15 days. The cross-linking treatment was carried out according to the general method of Quiocho and Richards (1964; Quiocho et al., 1967). The crystals were soaked in 1.2 mole/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.45) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 40 min. The crosslinking crystals were subsequently washed eight times with the same buffer without glutaradehyde, and again eight times with distilled water. The hexapeptide MYWYPY was provided by Prof. K. Wang (Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry). The complex was formed by soaking the cross-linking crystal for 20 days at 25°C in a solution containing 3 mmole/L of hexapeptide MYWYPY in sodium phosphate buffer 0.012 mole/L, 20% isopropanol, at pH 5.45. 2.2. Data Collection X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku RAXIS-IIC imaging plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. Reduction of data was performed with the

Zhang et al. program package PROCESS. Data collection statistics are presented in Table I. 2.3. Structure Refinement Conventional refinement of the positions and B-factors was performed using the X-PLOR program (Brünger et al., 1987). The initial resolution range was set to 8.0­3.0 Å and was extended to the highest resolution step by step. It was followed by mutual rebuilding into SIGMMA-weighting (Read, 1986) electron density maps with the TURBO-FRODO graphics program (Roussel and Cambillau, 1989). The behavior of Rfree was monitored (Brünger, 1992) at all times. The starting model for the refinement was provided by the PDB coordinates of concanavalin A (Naismith et al., 1994). In the initial model, only the atomic coordinates of the protein molecule and metal ions were introduced and all the temperature factors of the atoms were set to 20 Å2. The difference electron density map showed the presence of the water molecules. The sites of water molecules were added to the model whenever the electron density level was at least 3.0 in the (Fobs Fcalc) exp(i calc) maps. The molecules introduced were inspected visually to check whether the hydrogen-bonding geometry was correct, and they were given an initial Bfactor of 20 Å2. No oligopeptide atoms were included in the refinement until the refinement of the protein had reached convergence and the hexapeptide MYWYPY density pattern had become clear-cut. Based on the shape of the electron density, a hexapeptide MYWYPY was identified at the binding pockets. Figure 1a shows that the agreement

between the current model of peptide molecules and the (Fobs Fcalc) exp(i calc) map with the calculated structure factor obtained by omitting peptide molecules is quit satisfactory. When the R-factor reached 19.0% versus all data, the final refinement statistics were obtained as given in Table II.

3. RESULTS 3.1. Quality of the Model and the Difference Electron Density Map In order to give validity to the further discussion on details of the interaction between concanavalin A and the

hexapeptide, it is important to verify the quality of the structure on which this discussion is based. At the 1 level in the final (2Fobs Fcalc) exp(i calc) map, all the atoms in the model of concanavalin A have a well-defined pattern of electron density except for a few side chains, as previously mentioned in work on the concanavalin A/tripeptide complex (Zhang et al., 2001). The quality of the model is demonstrated by the observed electron density for residues 86 and 87 as well as for the organic solvent molecule isopropanol, as shown in Fig. 1b. The density for the hexapeptide is not unambiguous for all atoms and is not as strong as the surrounding binding site. The residues W4002 and Y4003 have notably weaker density than the other four residues (Fig. 2), signaling the presence of possible incomplete occupancy

Zhang et al. Waal distance of 3.38 Å. The atom O of the carbonyl group of W4002 is bound to the atom O of the hydroxyl group of S134 at 3.14 Å. The NE1 atom of the indole group makes a hydrogen bond with OE1 of Q132 of the symmetry-related molecule. The atom O of the carbonyl group of Y4003 is bound to the atom O of the carbonyl group of S21. The hydroxyl OH of Y4003 is bound to the OH of glutaraldehyde (denoted PTD in Fig. 4). The hydroxyl OH of Y4005 makes bifurcated hydrogen bonds of length 2.87 and 2.70 Å, respectively, with the carbonyl O atom of T11 and the carbonyl O atom of P206 of the symmetry-related molecule. Besides the polar interactions as mentioned above, P4004 and Y4005 are surrounded by hydrophobic groups that form a long, deep binding cleft. P13, P23, and T11 (CH3) are on one side, W182, H205, and P206 of the symmetry-related molecule are on the other side, and P4004 and Y4005 are in the middle, with interfaces to each side. This hydrophobic interface is presumably responsible for the association of polypeptide and concanavalin A. The CH group of P23 is above the aromatic ring of Y4005 at about 3.3 Å, and the ND1 atom of H205 is located axially near the aromatic ring of Y4005. Both positively polarized hydrogen atoms of P23 and H205 interact with the electron cloud of the aromatic ring, producing edge-to-face interaction. The spatial environment of the bound hexapeptide is shown in Fig. 4. 3.3. Concanavalin A­Solvent Molecule Isopropanol Interaction Isopropanol is found in the vicinity of the flexible loop region that is located between the two antiparallel pleated sheets, as shown in Fig. 3. The hydroxyl OH of isopropanol (denoted IPR in Fig. 5) makes a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom of E78. The two aliphatic CH3 of the IPR have a London interaction with the aliphatic C and H of P86 within a van der Waals distance of 3.66 and 3.74 Å, respectively. 4. DISCUSSION The binding pocket where the hexapeptide molecule binds with concanavalin A is similar to the one for the tripeptide in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2001). Figure 6 shows the ligands at the pocket site of concanavalin A superimposed with the corresponding region in the concanavalin A/tripeptide complex. 1. From Fig. 5 it is observed that the N-terminal residues M4000 and Y4001 are located at the entrance of the depression, and the C-terminal residue Y4005 is

and disorder. The residues M4000, W4001, P4004, and Y4005 are well enough defined in the electron density so that the direction of the polypeptide chain can be unambiguously identified and it is suggested that this is the dominant form present.

3.2. Concanavalin A­Hexapeptide Interaction The hexapeptide molecule found at crystal contacts is bound in a pocket that is formed by residues from the three concanavalin A molecules. Residue M4000 is the N-terminal of the hexapeptide. Its side chain is located toward the solvent and its backbone nitrogen atom is bound to the atom O of the carbonyl group of D151 (3.38 Å). The backbone nitrogen atom and carbonyl O atom of the residue Y4001 make hydrogen bonds of length 2.65 and 2.85 Å, respectively, with the atom O of the carbonyl group of G149. The hydroxyl OH atom of Y4001 makes a strong hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl OH atom of Y22. The residue W4002 is sandwiched between T15 and D151 of the symmetry-related molecule. On one side of the indole moiety of the W4002, the aliphatic portion CB of the T15 is stacked against the aromatic ring at 3.44 Å. On another side, the amide plane of O­C­N of the residue D151 of the symmetry-related molecule is ­ parallel stacked against the aromatic ring with a van der

located deeper into the pocket. It should be noted that the architecture of the binding site of Y4005 includes several hydrophobic residues that form the bottom of the pocket. In comparison with the corresponding portion of the polypeptide ligands, the indole moiety of the W4002 is strictly conserved in the same position of the aromatic

ring of Y3001. The aromatic group of residue Y4003 rotates about 47° from the position of Y3003 and in both cases there is glutaraldehyde in the vicinity of their hydroxyl OH group. The residue P4004 is shifted (by about 4 Å), in the direction toward the bottom of the depression from the position of residue P3002.

2. The solubility of the hexapeptide MYWYPY is lower than that of the tripeptide YPY in aqueous solutions. For concanavalin A to be incubated adequately with the hexapeptide, a larger amount of isopropanol (e.g., 20%) was added in aqueous solutions and it took longer for the crystal of cross-linked concanavalin A to soak in the mixture of isopropanol with water (e.g., 20 days). It is noteworthy that the hexapeptide MYWYPY is occupied more deeply at the pocket site than the tripeptide YPY, and the solvent molecule isopropanol is also bound at a binding site that is first explored. This clearly confirms the feasibility of the approach of mapping the binding surface of crystalline protein with a

probe molecule that is dissolved in a mixture of organic solvent with water or in neat organic solvent and is hardly dissolved in aqueous solution. 3. For the present work the electron density patch at the main-chain atoms of W4002 is markedly weaker than at the other four residues. The lack of significantly strong electron density levels indicates that the crystal should be composed of a mixture of the binding scheme of the hexapeptide. In this structure the hexapeptide is longer than the tripeptide so that it has a higher degree of flexibility. Therefore, the binding of hexapeptide, depending on the affinity of the subsites, produces variable electron density patterns.
