TKSA-GA Algorithm The TKSA-GA is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimization of charge-charge interactions in proteins (1-4), in which the energies of charge-charge interactions are calculated using Tanford-Kirkwood (TK) formalism (5) that includes surface accessibility (SA) correction as introduced by Gurd (6). The TKSA-GA algorithm consists of 5 major steps: Step 1. Calculate surface accessibility of residues and identify residues that are more than 50% exposed to solvent. All these residues (except Gly, Pro, Ala, or those side chains forming multiple hydrogen bonds and side chains located within 10  of the active sites and/or ligand binding sites) are, independent of whether they are charged, polar, or non-polar, allowed to be ionizable. Ionizable residues with less than 50% accessibility are fixed in their wild type identity. Step 2. Start genetic algorithm in which every ionizable residue that is not fixed can be positive, negative or neutral. For the genetic algorithm, individual charge distribution in a given sequence is considered to be a "chromosome". Usually optimization includes 100 "chromosomes" (1 wild type and 99 randomly generated). During each step of GA optimization, energies of individual "chromosomes" are calculated using TKSA algorithm. Each "chromosome" is allowed to randomly acquire point "mutation" (random substitution to negative, positive or neutral residue at a random position in sequence) and/or undergo "recombination" between two "chromosomes" (the point of "recombination" is also selected randomly). After "mutation" and/or "recombination" step, the energies of the resultant "chromosomes" are evaluated using TKSA algorithm. "Chromosomes" with the energies better than the WT are kept for the next round, while those that are not have certain probability to be retained for the next round. These chromosomes are subjected to the next round of optimization (i.e. "mutation"/"recombination"), and the process is repeated until no changes in energy of charge-charge interactions is observed. During the run, all sequences that have energies better than the wild type are saved. Step 3. Sort the energies as a function of number of substitutions (see e.g. Figure 2). Step 4. Choose sequences that have less than 5% of residues substituted or 2-3 substitutions before the energy levels off (see Figure 2). Step 5. Build structural ensemble models for top 10 sequences for each number of substitutions using MODELLER, recalculate energies of charge-charge interactions using TKSA (see Figure 2) and MCCE (see Figure S1). The sequence with the most favorable energy is subject to experimental test. The pairwise energy of interactions between two charges in TKSA formalism is calculated as (5):

 Aij - Bij Cij  Eij =  2    2b - 2a   (1 - SAij )  

S1

where b is the radius of protein (represented as a sphere of low dielectric constant, usually taken to be 4), a is the ion exclusion sphere (a=b+1.4), Aij, Bij, and Cij are the coefficients that are proportional to the dielectric constants of protein and water, temperature, ionic strength, and distance between charges, and SAij is the pairwise accessibility of the two pair of the ionizable residues. The pairwise energy is converted to the Gibbs energy at a given pH in a form of meanfield perturbation to the intrinsic pKa values as:
G N ( pH ) = - RT  (ln 10) (qi + xi )  pK int,i +
i =1 n

1 n  Eij (qi + xi )  (q j + x j ) 2 i , j =1

S2

where xi and xj are the fractional protonations of the interacting groups and qi and qj are the charges of unprotonated forms (1 for Arg/Lys/His/Ntr and 0 for Asp/Glu/Ctr). The intrinsic pKa values used for ionizable residues were as follows: Asp = 4.0; Glu = 4.5; His = 6.3; Lys = 10.6; Arg = 12.0; N-terminus (Ntr) = 7.7; C-terminus (Ctr) = 3.6. The energy of charge-charge interactions in the unfolded state is assumed to be unperturbed by the substitutions. Cloning, Expression, Purification and Characterization cDNA encoding Cdc42 F28L variant was kindly provided by Dr. R. Cerione and consequently subcloned with the C-terminal 6xHis tag into the pGia expression vector (7) using standard molecular biology protocols. Wild type acylphosphatase cloning has been previously described (4). Desired codon substitutions were introduced into the wild type genes using either PCR step mutagenesis procedure or, where applicable, a Quick-change protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cdc42GAP gene was synthesized and cloned into pGia expression vector by Blue Heron Biotechnology, Inc. (Bothell, WA). Expression and purification of wild type and designed acylphosphatase was done as described (4). To express Cdc42GAP, and wild type and designed Cdc42 variants, BL21(DE3) pLysS cells were transformed with the corresponding plasmid constructs and grown in 2xYT medium to an optical density of 1.1-1.5 at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1.0-1.5 mM of IPTG. Cells were incubated for additional 4-7 hours, harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm and resuspended in ~35 ml of the native lysis buffer (Ni-NTA kit, (Novagen, Madison, WI). Recombinant Cdc42GAP and Cdc42 variants were purified on the NiNTA resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) under native conditions, as recommended by the resin manufacturer. Final purification step included gel-filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G75 column (2.5x100 cm) in 50mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM KCl, pH 7.5. Protein yields ranged from 40 to 120 mg per 1 liter of bacterial culture. Purity of the resulting protein preparations was better than 95%, as judged by the Coomassie staining of SDS polyacrylamide gels. Uniformally labeled 15N and 15N/13C AcPh-wt and AcPh-des proteins were expressed in MOPS based minimal media with 15N-ammonum sulfate and 13C-glucose as the only sources of nitrogen and carbon, respectively, as described in (8, 9). Protein purification was essentially the same as for the unlabeled samples. Identity of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy on Voyager DE-PRO (Perseptive Biosystems/Applied Biosystems). Protein concentrations were -2-

Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed with the Cdc42 and AcPh protein variants to determine the oligomerization state of the proteins in solution. All measurements were done on a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm in 6 sector cells with 1.2 cm light path, using two different loading concentrations - 12.3 M and 24.6 M for Cdc42, and 14.4 M and 28.7 M for AcPh. Samples were equilibrated at three different rotor speeds (in rpm) ­ 20,000, 30,000 and 35,000 for Cdc42 and 22,000, 30,000 and 35,000 for AcPh. Absorbance data were fitted to the equation  M  (1 -   V )   2  (r 2 - ro2 )  S3 A(r ) = I o + C m (ro ) exp  m  2  R T  

where A(r): absorbance at radial position r, Mm: molecular mass of protein, V : partial specific volume of protein, calculated from the amino acid composition (10), : solution density, Io: baseline offset term, and : rotor angular velocity.
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)

The thermodynamics of binding of the Cdc42-wt, Cdc42-des1 and Cdc42-des2, to Cdc42GAP were characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The experimental design and data analysis was as described previously (11, 12). Briefly, all three proteins were dialyzed simultaneously against 3 changes of 1 L each of 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM TCEP, and 80 M GDP. Cdc42GAP samples were used in the ITC syringe as the ligand in all binding reactions with concentrations between 0.25 and 0.75 mM. Cdc42-wt, Cdc42-des1 and Cdc42-des2 were placed in the thermostated cell at concentrations of 0.031 mM, 0.04 mM, and 0.056 mM, respectively. All titrations were carried out at 5°C. The heats of mixing and dilution, obtained by titrating respective concentrations of Cdc42GAP into the same buffer, were used to correct the heats from Cdc42GAP-Cdc42 titrations. Data were analyzed and fitted to a single-site model using the Microcal Origin software supplied with the calorimeter: Q = H

where Q is the heat of the reaction, [M]T is the total concentration of protein in the cell expressed per monomer, [L]T is the total protein concentration in the syringe, H is the enthalpy of binding and K is the equilibrium constant.

Wednesday, January 07, 2009

CD experiments were carried out on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired in triplicate at 25 oC in a 1 mm quartz cylindrical cuvette at a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/mL. Ellipticity values were fitted to the equation:

 (T ) = FN (T ) ×  N (T ) + FU (T ) ×  U (T )

S5

where (T) is measured ellipticity at any given temperature, N(T) and U(T) are ellipticity values of the native and unfolded protein at this temperature, FN and FU are fractions of the native and unfolded protein at this temperature. Fractions of the native and unfolded proteins were calculated as K FN = S6 1+ K 1 S7 FU = 1+ K where K is the equilibrium constant of the two-state unfolding reaction calculated as G (- ) FU K= = e RT S8 FN

G of the unfolding reaction was calculated as

H (Tm )  T G(T ) = (Tm - T )   - C p  - T  C p  ln( ) Tm  Tm 

S9

where Tm is the transition temperature, H(Tm) is the enthalpy change at the transition temperature, Cp is the heat capacity change. Temperature-induced unfolding of Cdc42 was monitored by recording ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Since Cdc42 unfolds irreversibly, only T1/2 values are reported (temperature at which CD signal is 50% of the total change).
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)

DSC experiments with the wild type and designed AcPh were conducted on a VP-DSC instrument (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) at a scan rate of 90 deg/h. Protein concentrations were 1 mg/mL in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Reversibility of unfolding was checked by recording the second scan and was found to be more than 90%, as judged by the area under the excess heat capacity function. Calorimetric profiles were analyzed according to a two-state model using nonlinear regression routine NLREG (13) and scripts written in-house (14, 15).
Activity measurements: Cdc42

The GTPase activities of Ccd42 variants were determined and compared with that of Ccd42-wt. All reactions were carried out in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) buffer at pH 7.5. Various concentrations of protein (final concentrations: 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1 or 2 M) were incubated

with eight different concentrations of GTP (final concentrations: 0, 3.1, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 M) in a total volume of 1 ml. At 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours 50 L samples of each reaction were transferred to a 96 well plate and 100 L of Biomol-Green reagent (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) was immediately added to each well using a multi-channel pipette. After a 20 min interval the amount of phosphate generated was determined colorimetrically by monitoring absorbance at 620 nm. Temperature-induced inactivation of Cdc42 variants was determined following protein incubation for 10 min at temperatures ranging from 25 to 70 °C at 5 °C intervals. Treated samples were centrifuged and the supernatant diluted to 500 L in buffer containing TCEP and analyzed for GTPase activity at 25°C, as described above. GTPase activities of Cdc42-wt and two designed variants, Cdc42-des1 and Cdc42-des2, were also determined in the presence of GTPase Activating Protein (Cdc42GAP). These experiments were performed as described above, but in the presence of different amounts of Cdc42GAP (ratios of Cdc42GAP to Cdc42 used were ­ 1:5, 1:1 and 10:1). The lower GAP concentration was chosen to limit its role to a catalytic one; whereas excess GAP concentrations were analyzed to eliminate the possibility that sub-saturating concentrations could limit the reaction rate. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat were obtained by fitting the initial reaction rates (normalized to enzyme concentration) at various GTP concentrations to the Michaelis-Menten equation S10 using non-linear regression routine NLREG (13). GTP undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis hence it is critical to account for background absorbance at each GTP concentration, in addition to that in the absence of both GTP and protein. Toward this end, it was ascertained that plots of [GTP] vs. absorbance at each time point were linear with equal slopes. Thus, after background subtraction the resulting absorbance values do not have contributions from spontaneous GTP hydrolysis, which would be the case if nonlinear [GTP] vs. absorbance plots were observed. For reactions in the presence of GAP, the absorbance was also corrected for contributions from background GAP GTPase activity.
Activity measurements: AcPh

Acylphosphatase activity of the wild type and designed AcPh variants was monitored using synthetic substrate benzoylphosphate (16). Benzoylphosphate prepared and purified as described (17). Benzoylphosphate stock solution was prepared in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Protein concentration in the assays ranged from 2.3 to 10 nM. Acylphosphatase activity was determined in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5 at 25ºC, 40ºC, and 55ºC by measuring rates of substrate hydrolysis at varying substrate concentrations. Hydrolysis of benzoylphosphate was followed spectrophotometrically on a Hitachi U-2001 (San Jose, CA), by measuring absorbance decrease at 283 nm upon complete enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate and using an extinction coefficient change of A283nm of 0.63 mM-1cm-1 (16). At 55ºC enzymatic hydrolysis rates had to be corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis of benzoylphosphate at this temperature. Two to five independent experiments were performed at each substrate concentration, hydrolysis rates were normalized to protein concentration and average values are reported. Km and kcat parameters were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear regression routine NLREG (13)). k  [S ]  = cat S10 K m + [S ] -5-

Effect of temperature on aggregation of Cdc42

Cdc42-wt, Cdc42-des1 or Cdc42-des2 at a concentration of 2 mg/ml were incubated for 10 min in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, at pH 7.5 at 25, 35, 50, 60, 65 and 70 oC without agitation. The samples were then centrifuged (20 min at 13,000g) to precipitate the aggregated protein and supernatant was diluted with the same buffer containing TCEP to achieve a final concentration of 1.5 mM TCEP in 500 L sample. Fraction of monomeric protein remaining in solution was determined by injecting 400 L of the sample onto a Phenomenex Biosep-SEC-S 2000 PEEK column connected to the AKTA 10 chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mobile phase was the same buffer containing TCEP and used at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Eluate was quantified for soluble protein concentration by UV detection at 280 nm. Untreated samples were similarly analyzed. The amount of soluble protein present in each sample, calculated from the peak areas of the respective chromatograms, is expressed as a percentage of the untreated protein.
NMR methods

All NMR spectra were obtained at 27°C on 600 and 800 MHz Bruker spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes. Protein concentrations of 0.4 to 1 mM were used for all experiments, in 20 mM phosphate buffer, 50 mM NaCl, at pH 5.7. Polypeptide backbone assignments were obtained with HNCO, HNCACB, and HN(CO)CACB (see Supplementary Figure S7). Sidechain assignments were obtained through the analysis of 3D 13C-separated HCCH-TOCSY and COSY spectra. Distance constraints were obtained from a 3D 15N-NOESY spectrum recorded at 1 H frequency of 600 MHz, and two 3D 13C-NOESY spectra recorded with a 150 ms mixing time at a 1H frequency of 800 MHz with the 13C carrier frequency in the aliphatic and the aromatic region, respectively. The three data sets were peak-picked and automatically assigned using the CANDID macro for CYANA (18). Dihedral angle constraints were obtained using the program Talos (19). The structural statistics are listed in supplementary Table S1.
