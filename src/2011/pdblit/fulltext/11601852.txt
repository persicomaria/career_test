The X-ray Structure of Aspergillus aculeatus Polygalacturonase and a Modeled Structure of the Polygalacturonase-Octagalacturonate Complex

School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, and Center for Molecular Catalysis Seoul National University Seoul 151-742, Korea Polygalacturonases hydrolyze the a-(1-4) glycosidic bonds of de-esteri®ed pectate in the smooth region of the plant cell wall. Crystal structures of polygalacturonase from Aspergillus aculeatus were determined at pH 4.5 Ê and 8.5 both to 2.0 A resolution. A. aculeatus polygalacturonase is a glycoprotein with one N and ten O-glycosylation sites and folds into a right-handed parallel b-helix. The structures of the three independent molecules are essentially the same, showing no dependency on pH or crystal packing, and are very similar to that of Aspergillus niger polygalacturonase. However, the structures of the long T1 loop containing a catalytic tyrosine residue are signi®cantly different in the two proteins. A three-dimensional model showing the substrate binding mode for a family 28 hydrolase was obtained by a combined approach of ¯exible docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and energy minimization. The octagalacturonate substrate was modeled as an unbent irregular helix with the À1 ring in a half-chair (4H3) form that approaches the transition state conformation. A comparative modeling of the three polygalacturonases with known structure shows that six subsites ranging from À4 to 2 are clearly de®ned but subsites À5 and 3 may or may not be shaped depending on the nearby amino acid residues. Both distal subsites are mostly exposed to the solvent region and have weak binding af®nity even if they exist. The complex model provides a clear explanation for the functions, either in catalysis or in substrate binding, of all conserved amino acid residues in the polygalacturonase family of proteins. Modeling suggests that the role of the conserved Asn157 and Tyr270, which had previously been unidenti®ed, may be in transition state stabilization. In A. niger polygalacturonase, the long T1 loop may have to undergo conformational change upon binding of the substrate to bring the tyrosine residue close to subsite À1.

sive networks in which cellulose micro®brils are embedded.1 Pectic polysaccharides exist in the cell wall either as ``smooth'' regions of a linear copolymer of a-D-(1-4)-linked galacturonic acid that may be partially esteri®ed or as ``hairy'' regions consisting of repeating stretches of 1,4-a-D-galacturonate1,2-a-L-rhamnose dimer in which the rhamnosyl residues may be substituted with L-arabinose and D-galactose-rich side-chains.

864 plant pathogens, while fungal pectinases are used in industrial processes for juice clari®cation.2 Enzymes that degrade pectins belong to two classi®cations; the lyases and the hydrolases.3 The lyases such as pectin-, pectate- and rhamnogalacturonan lyases form an unsaturated C-C bond at the non-reducing end of the cleaved polysaccharide by the b-elimination reaction. In contrast, the hydrolases such as polygalacturonase and rhamnogalacturonase form saturated saccharides. X-ray analyses revealed that all of these pectinolytic enzymes have a very characteristic fold called a parallel b-helix. Proteins with known crystal structures include pectate lyases from Erwinia chrysanthemi4,5 and Bacillus subtilis,6 pectin lyases B and C from Aspergillus niger,7,8 rhamnogalacturonase from A. aculeatus (RGA),9 polygalacturonase from E. carotovora ssp. carotovora (PGC),10 polygalacturonase II from A. niger (PGN)11 and pectin methylesterase from E. chrysanthemi.12 Similar bhelix structures have also been observed in Bordetella pertussis virulence factor P.69 pertactin that is involved in polysaccharide recognition,13 the phage P22 tailspike rhamnosidase,14 and chondroitinase in the intercellular matrix.15 Polygalacturonases hydrolyze the 1,4-linkage of de-esteri®ed pectate in the smooth region,16 and rhamnogalacturonases hydrolyze the 1,2-linkage in the hairy region.17 Both enzymes, classi®ed as family 28, are of inverting type. In inverting enzymes, the glycosidic linkages are hydrolyzed by a single displacement mechanism with inversion of anomeric con®guration, while, in retaining enzymes, the reaction proceeds via a double displacement mechanism with retention of anomeric con®guration.18 Both types of glycosidases have a pair of carboxylic acid groups at the active site; one acting as a general acid and the other as a general base. It has been suggested that in inverting enzymes the two catalytic residues are located Ê approximately 10(Æ2) A apart, on average, Ê whereas they are approximately 5.5 A apart in 19 10 retaining enzymes. PGC and RGA9 are the enzymes whose structures were determined ®rst among family 28 hydrolases. They have four equivalent acidic residues conserved at the active site. These include Asp159, Asp162, Asp180 and Asp181 in PGC, and three Asp residues and a Glu residue instead of Asp181 in RGA (hereinafter, all numbering refers to the equivalent residues in PGA unless stated otherwise). The crystal structures showed that the equivalent residues occupy similar spatial positions. However, the widest sepÊ aration between these acidic residues is 5.6 A, and the catalytic residues could not be identi®ed unequivocally on the basis of the distance criteria suggested for the inverting mechanism. Very recently, the researchers in the Benen group clari®ed many characteristics of polygalacturonase from combined studies on PGN, including site-directed mutagenesis and crystallographic analysis, in collaboration with the Dijkstra group, as well as biochemical characterization.11,20 ± 22 They

established that the substrate binds with the nonreducing end toward the N terminus of the enzyme. They identi®ed Asp180 as a general acid and an activated water molecule bound between Asp159 and Asp181 as a nucleophile, suggesting that the family 28 enzymes do not conform to the ``standard'' inverting mechanism (as far as the separation between the acid and the base is concerned).11 From bond cleavage frequencies of oligosaccharides of different lengths, they estimated the minimum number of subsites is seven.20 By comparing the structures of PGN and the rhamnosidase-nanosaccharide complex,23 they derived a disaccharide binding model with which the role of strictly conserved residues could be explained.11 In this model, the galacturonopyranose (GalpA) unit at subsite À1 (see Davies et al.24 for binding site nomenclature) was modeled in a boat form. To date no crystal structure has been reported for a family 28 hydrolase in complex with a saccharide. The crystal structure of the inactive mutant of pectin lyase C complexed with a pentaGalpA remains the only example for the pectinolytic enzyme complex.25 This structure shows that four ordered GalpA residues assume a mix of the stable 21 and 31 helical conformations with all rings in the relaxed chair form. van Santen et al.11 described that a stable conformer of trigalacturonate could not be docked into the active site of PGN due to clashes between the enzyme and the GalpA1 residue. Unfortunately, their modeling investigations were not discussed in detail. Polygalacturonase is a major component of industrial pectinases.26 Here we have determined the crystal structures of polygalacturonase from A. aculeatus (PGA), puri®ed from a commercial Ê pectinase, at pH 4.5 and pH 8.5 both to 2.0 A resolution. No detailed biochemical studies on PGA have been reported, while PGN has been characterized extensively. According to the cDNA (GenBank accession number: AF054893; Kauppinen et al.27) and the present crystallographic data, PGA is a protein with 339 residues naturally matured from the precursor containing a signal peptide of 39 residues. Nearing the completion of our independent structure determination of PGA for the pH 8.5 form, the crystal structure of PGN was published.11 The two Aspergillus polygalacturonases are highly homologous with sequence identity of 60.7 % and their overall structures are very similar. However, the two crystal structures also revealed that the conformations of the T1 loop containing a catalytic tyrosine residue are signi®cantly different. The present study provided an opportunity to examine the previously unrecognized structural characteristics of the polygalacturonase family of proteins as well as the effects of pH and crystal packing forces on the structure. We also performed a modeling study that combined ¯exible docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and energy minimization, following lack of success in our efforts to obtain the complex crystals. We derived a plausible model for the Michaelis complex of

865 pH-driven conformational change in the loop containing six residues.7 In contrast, the structure of PGA does not vary as a function of pH or crystal packing forces, showing that it is relatively rigid. When the three independent PGA molecules are superimposed, molecule A shows rms deviations Ê of 0.24 and 0.20 A for all 1356 main-chain atoms Ê and 0.59 and 0.54 A for 1077 side-chain atoms with molecules B and C, respectively. Further discussion is presented based on molecule C that is a form at the active pH. Parallel b-helix structure PGA folds into a large right-handed parallel Ê b-helix with overall dimensions of 65 A Â Ê Â 36 A, as shown in Figure 1(a). The amino Ê 34 A acid residues forming the b strands and the sharp turns, as well as the pattern of the side-chain alignment, are summarized in Table 2. There are 12 (ten complete) turns and the number of residues per turn varies from 22 to 29, excluding the residues in the loop regions. There are 42 parallel b-strands in total, each containing from two to six residues. These b-strands form four twisted parallel b-sheets, termed PB1, PB1a, PB2 and PB3 (Figure 1(b)), each of which consists of ten, nine, 12, and 11 strands, with average numbers of residues equal to 4.3, 2.4, 4.4 and 3.9, respectively. A total of 157 residues (46.3 %) out of 339 form the parallel b-helix with 211 inter-strand hydrogen bonds. The average rise Ê per turn varies from 4.6 to 5.1 A, with a mean of Ê 4.8 A, a value typical for the parallel b-helical structures.30 The b strands are separated by turns that consist of either a sharp bend or a loop. Thirty-three amino acid residues, including ten Asp, nine Asn and seven Gly residues, make sharp turns in a left-handed a-helical conformation. While most of the T2 and T3 turns are sharp bends, the T1 and the T4 turns are more diverse. T1 turns comprise from 1 to 15 amino acid residues and the T4 turns from 4 to 21. The T1 turns are relatively longer near the C-terminal side of the b-helix, whereas the T4 turns are longer near the N-terminal side. The slightly twisted b-helix contains a long cleft wrapped by two protruding loop regions of the T1 and T4 turns. The PB1 b-sheet forms the relatively ¯at bottom of the cleft, while the PB1a and PB3 sheets form both sides of the cylinder and the PB2 twisted b-sheet serves as the back wall of the cylinder opposite to the cleft. The substrate binding cleft is oriented obliquely to the helical axis of the b-helix, and is open at both ends in accordance with the endohydrolytic character of the enzyme. The side-chain stacking or alignment is one of the characteristic features of the parallel b-helix structures. PB1, PB1a, PB2 and PB3 b-sheets contribute two, one, two and two arrays of the sidechain stacks inside the b-helix, and one, one, two and two arrays outside the b-helix, respectively, involving 175 residues in total (Table 2). Among the 75 residues inside the b-helix, 68 residues are

PGA-octaGalpA. The model provides a clear explanation for functions of all conserved amino acid residues in the polygalacturonase family of proteins. The details of interaction modes shown in this model may also provide a basis for further mutagenesis studies of the elaborate catalytic mechanism and the pattern of substrate cleavage.

Results and Discussion
Description of the PGA structure PGA crystallizes in two crystal forms; form I at pH 8.5 with one molecule (called A) in the asymmetric unit and form II at pH 4.6 with two independent molecules (called B and C). The details of data collection and re®nement statistics are listed in Table 1. Each PGA model contains all the protein atoms, ten mannose, two N-acetylglucosamine and one mannose (NAG-NAG-MAN) residue. The overall coordinate errors, estimated from a Luzzati Ê plot, are 0.217 A for the crystal at pH 8.5 and Ê for the crystal at pH 4.5.28 The geometry of 0.222 A the ®nal model checked with PROCHECK29 is very good. In the Ramachandran plot, taking into account only the non-glycine and non-N or non-Cterminal residues, 475 residues (86.2 %) are in the most favored region with 74 residues (13.4 %) in the additionally allowed region, and two residues (0.4 %) are found in the generously allowed region. It has been found that pectin lyase A undergoes a

hydrophobic, including 48 Leu/Ile/Val residues (70.6 %) out of the total of 68 in PGA. The remainder includes four Ser, two Thr, and one Tyr residues. Most side-chains aligned outside the b-helix are hydrophilic. There are two aromatic stacking interactions, one between the three Phe residues at the PB1 b-sheet and the other between the two Phe and one Tyr residues at the PB2 b-sheet. Each turn also shows side-chain stacking including the socalled Asp-Asn ladder.4 Helices and disulfide bonds There are one a-helix and two short 310-helices in PGA. The a-helix (Asn10-Thr20) is located near the

N terminus and shields the hydrophobic core of the b-helix, and the 310-helices (Gly88-Trp91 and Ser148-Asp151) occur in two different T4 loops. PGA contains four disul®de bridges that help maintain the integrity of the b-helix. The ®rst, Cys4-Cys22, grips the a-helix and the N-terminal b-strand together, thus ensuring the ``capping'' of the b-helix. The Phe6 and a couple of mannose residues further block the entry to the interior of the b-helix. The second, Cys182-Cys198, connects the PB1 and PB4 strands in the sixth complete turn at the active site. The third, Cys306-Cys311, connects the PB1 and PB1a strands in the second last turn. The fourth, Cys330-Cys339, clamps the C-terminal residue making the last four residues

shield approximately half of the entry to the interior of the a-helix. Hydrophobic Val295, Ile302, Trp316, Val319, and Val321 residues further block the remaining entry. The peptide bonds of Pro65 and Ser208 are in cis conformation. Glycosylation and ion binding sites Polygalacturonases from the Aspergillus species are glycoproteins with at least one N-glycosylation site.31 The present study revealed that PGA is highly glycosylated with one N and ten O-glycosylation sites. The electron densities for carbo-

hydrates were clean for all three independent molecules. N-Glycosylation occurs at Asn219 located at the T2 sharp turn. The NAG-NAG-MAN chain is directed toward the N terminus partially covering the PB2 b-sheet and exposed to the solvent region. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the recombinant PGN has a high-mannose type of glycan with the heterogeneous carbohydrate chains,32 but only one NAG residue was identi®ed in the crystal structure of PGN. Also, in PGA, it is quite probable that the additional mannose residues are present but disordered in the crystal. The O-linked mannose residues are

868 attached to Thr5 and Thr8, and eight serine residues at positions 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 18, 23 and 34. All of them are located near the N terminus. The present structure indicates that the carbohydrate content of PGA amounts to at least 6.5 % (2.42 kDa) by weight. Cadmium was essential for crystallization at pH 4.6. Three cadmium ions in the asymmetric unit were found in the crystal lattice, mediating crystal contacts. For each of the B and C molecules, a cadmium ion is coordinated to His202 and Asp231, and Gln295 from its symmetry-related molecule. The third one is coordinated to Asp248B and Asp285C, Asp313C. For each ion, a water molecule is the fourth ligand in a distorted tetrahedral coordination sphere. Comparison with other family 28 glycosyl hydrolases The parallel b-helix structures of the pectinolytic hydrolases and lyases differ in detail. The hydrolases are composed of 10 to 11 complete turns of b-strands that are coiled into four parallel b-sheets, while the lyases are composed of six to eight turns of the b-strands that are coiled into three parallel b-sheets. PGN,11 PGC10 and PGA have ten complete turns, while RGA9 has one more turn at the C-terminal end. Superposition of the equivalent Ca Ê positions for PGA gives rms deviations of 0.76 A with PGN (330 out of 335 residues, sequence idenÊ tity of 60.7 %), 1.23 A with PGC (237/376, 24.2 %), Ê and 1.30 A with RGA (265/422, 21.8 %). The structures of the four hydrolases show little variation in the PB1, PB2 and PB3 b-sheets or the T2 and T3 sharp turns. Figure 2 shows similarity and dissimilarity in the structures of the three polygalacturonases

around the active site. The structures of PGA and PGN show much resemblance to each other, but PGC has different structures in most of the T1 and T4 loops and several regions of the parallel b-helix. A notable difference between the structures of PGA and PGN occurs in a long T1 loop that forms the ninth complete turn and contains a catalytic tyrosine residue. This loop comprises 15 residues from Gln268 (QNYGDTSSTPTTGVP) in PGA and 17 residues from Gln289 (QDYEDGK PTGLPTNGVT) in PGN. The residues with the underlined sequences have different structures while other residues are in register in the two proteins. The corresponding loop in PGC comprises 13 residues from Thr312 (TVYEKKEGSNVPD) and has a quite different structure. Apparently, all three tyrosine residues seem to occupy similar positions. However, in PGN, Tyr291 may not function properly if the loop structure in the crystal remains unchanged, as discussed in the modeling section below. Ser229 of PGN and Ser257 of PGC, equivalent to Ser208 of PGA, also exist in cis conformation. These serine residues make a sharp turn at a T1 loop in the seventh complete turn and are involved in substrate binding. The T4 loops are signi®cantly longer in PGC than in PGA and PGN. Despite the differences in the detailed structures, the highly conserved amino acid residues and the catalytic water molecule occupy essentially the same positions in three proteins as shown in Figure 2. In the three independent PGA molecules re®ned in this study, there are many water molecules around the active site, but the water bound between Asp159 and Asp181 is the only one that occupies a common site. This also supports the contention that the nucleophilic water is correctly assigned in the boat model.11

Figure 2. Stereo view showing the similarity and dissimilarity along the binding clefts of the three polygalacturonases with known structure. Seven PB1 b-strands and some T1 and T4 loops that comprise the third to the ninth complete turn are superposed for PGA (red), PGN (blue) and PGC (yellow). The amino acid residues that form the binding cleft of each protein are also compared with the labels drawn only for PGA for clarity. The amino acid residues labeled in green are strictly conserved in the polygalacturonase family of proteins. The catalytic water molecule Ow is hydrogen-bonded to Asp159 and Asp181.

869 and the a-helix at the N-terminal end are always present in all proteins. At the N-terminal end, all ®ve bacterial and all 17 plant proteins have a long tail, while all 21 fungal proteins do not have a tail. At the C-terminal end, a disul®de bridge is present in all plant proteins but absent in all bacterial proteins, and only some of the bacterial and plant proteins have a long tail. All fungal proteins have a disul®de bridge without a long tail at the C-terminal end, except for the one from Claviceps purpurea that has a tail without a disul®de bridge. These indicate that the polygalacturonases from the same species utilize a common scheme to protect the parallel b-helix structure and the modes of combining the capping motives vary depending on the species. A modeled structure of the polygalacturonaseoctagalacturonate complex A stereo view of the PGA-octaGalpA complex model is shown in Figure 3. The model may represent the Michaelis complex in the reaction pathway. The solvent-accessible surface and space ®lling representations clearly show that the binding cleft is deep and the middle segment of the substrate tightly binds to the cleft. The non-reducing end of the substrate is directed toward the N Á terminus of the enzyme as suggested by Pages et al.22 The binding cleft is formed by the amino acid residues from seven PB1 b-strands (in third to ninth complete turns) and several T1 and T4 turns, Ê and spans less than 27 A. A detailed interaction

In the pectinolytic hydrolases, the structural integrity of the parallel b-helix is protected by the ``capping'' motives at either end of the b-helix as well as the glycosylation. The capping motif includes a disul®de bridge or a long tail at the N or C-terminal end. PGA has a glycosylation scheme different from those of PGN, PGC and RGA, all of which are recombinant proteins. PGA has one N-glycosylation site and is highly O-glycosylated at the N-terminal side, whereas PGN has only one N-glycosylation site. PGC is not glycosylated at all, although it has six potential N-glycosylation sites that are located at the sharp turns with the consensus sequence of Asn-X-Thr/Ser. RGA has two N-glycosylation sites and is highly O-glycosylated at the C-terminal side. The four proteins show similarity and dissimilarity in their capping schemes. They commonly have an a-helix and a disul®de bridge at the N-terminal end. The fungal PGA, PGN and RGA have a disul®de bridge at the C-terminal end. However, in the bacterial PGC there is no disul®de bridge and mostly hydrophobic residues cover the large open surface of the C-terminal end. PGA and PGN have a quite compact b-helix structure with no tail at the N or C-terminal end. PGC has a tail of 15 residues at the N-terminal end but no tail at the C-terminal end, while RGA has long tails of 19 and 45 residues at both the N and C-terminal ends, respectively, both of which cover the PB2 sheet. Sequence analysis of 43 known polygalacturonases (data not shown) revealed interesting systematics in the capping scheme. A disul®de bridge

870 mode between the protein and the substrate is shown in Figure 4 and the hydrogen bonding interactions are listed in Table 3. In the complex model, the conformations of the main chains of several loops that were allowed to move during simulations are indistinguishable from those in the crystal structure. The movements of the side-chains were not large except for several residues. Conformation of the substrate The octagalacturonate was modeled as an unbent irregular helix and the pyranose ring of the GalpAÀ1 residue has a half-chair (4H3) form while other rings have a relaxed chair (4C1) form. The glycosidic torsion angles f(O5i-C1i-O4i  l-C4i  l) and c(C1i-O4i  l-C4i  l-C5i  l) between the a-1,4linked galacturonate units are listed in Table 4. The GalpAÀ5-GalpAÀ4 and GalpAÀ4-GalpAÀ3 segments have a 21 helical conformation while the GalpA1GalpA2 has a 31 conformation. The GalpAÀ2-GalpAÀ1 and GalpA2-GalpA3 segments have an intermediate conformation between the 21 and 31 helices. The GalpAÀ3-GalpAÀ2 has a c angle similar to a 21 helix, but its f angle differs by 54  from 80  for the stable helices. The f angle between GalpAÀ1 and GalpA1 is 1  , also deviating con-

siderably from the ideal value. However, it is not the dimer itself but the GalpAÀ1 ring that is strained. For many years, the structure of pectate has been pictured as either a 2133 or a 31 helix,34 and effects such as pectate concentration, hydration, or cation type are postulated to cause transition between 21 and 31 helical conformations of pectate.35 A recent nuclear magnetic resonance study, however, showed that the in situ structure of pectate in the plant cell wall is much more complex, containing both 21 and 31 helices as well as intermediate conformational states.36 The conformation of tetraGalpA in the pectin lyase C-pentaGalpA complex is also a mix of 21 and 31 righthanded helices, as compared in Table 4.25 The present model shows that deviation from the ideal helical conformation is determined by the speci®c interactions with the amino acid residues in PGA. Subsites À1 and 1 In PGA, the activated water molecule Ow, bound between Asp159 and Asp181, and Asp180, a general acid that donates a proton during bond cleavage, are closely located at the bottom of the Ê active site with a separation less than 4.5 A. This arrangement of the catalytic species requires that

the GalpAÀ1-GalpA1 segment should be in a strained conformation if both rings take a normal chair form, since the C1-H bond and the lone pair electrons of O4 are always oriented in opposing directions in all stable conformers. Three plausible models for the PGA-octaGalpA complex were obtained from the present modeling study. Among these, the 4H3 half-chair model was preferred to the 4C1 chair and the E3 envelope models on the basis of the energetics of the GalpAÀ1-GalpA1 segment as well as its interaction modes with the catalytic species. In the chair model, the digalacturonate segment has a severely strained conformation with f of 34  and c of 79  . This conformer is higher in energy by about

15 kcal/mol than the global minimum according to the published energy map.37,38 The overall features of the half-chair and the envelope models apparently look similar but there are signi®cant, albeit small, differences in detail. In the envelope model, the f and c angles are À25  and 130  , Ê respectively. There is a close contact (2.1 A) between H-C3 of GalpAÀ1 and O3 of GalpA1, and the chair form of GalpA1 is signi®cantly deformed presumably to relieve the inter-residue contacts. These indicate that the dimer segment in the envelope model is also strained as in the chair model. In the half-chair model, however, there is no close inter-residue contact, suggesting that the dimer segment may be comparable in energy to the glo-

872 bal minimum. The half-chair and envelope forms of a pyranose ring are higher in energy by about 9 kcal/mol than a chair.39 Therefore, it is very likely that the GalpAÀ1-GalpA1 segment in the half-chair model may be more stable than the others. In the half-chair model, Ow is in an ideal position for nucleophilic attack on the anomeric C1 Ê at a distance of 3.1 A and the hydroxyl Od1 of Asp180 is directed to the lone pair electrons of glyÊ cosidic O4 at a distance of 3.4 A. In the chair model, the Ow Á Á ÁC1 and Od1(Asp180) Á Á ÁO4 disÊ Ê tances are 3.0 A and 3.6 A, respectively, indicating that the arrangement of the catalytic species is not so ordered as in the half-chair model. van Santen et al. originally proposed a compelling digalacturonate binding model with which the role of the strictly conserved residues could be explained.11 They noticed that the three catalytic aspartic residues of PGN are spatially arranged very similarly to those in the rhamnosidase-nanosaccharide complex.23 In their model presented schematically, the GalpA1 ring is depicted as a chair and the GalpAÀ1 ring as a boat following the conformation of rhamnose in the complex. However, the present study shows that the GalpAÀ1 may instead adopt a 4H3 half-chair which approaches the transition state conformation. Induced saccharide distortion on binding to glycosyl hydrolases has been evidenced by crystallographic analyses.40 For example, saccharide is distorted to a half-chair in lysozyme,41 a boat in endoglucanase I42 and xylanase,43 or a skew form in cellulase Cel5A.44 Substrate distortion is observed at subsite À1 and implicated to be important in stabilizing the oxocarbenium-ion-like transition state.45 Distortion usually gives rise to the axial orientation for the leaving group, which is preferred owing to favorable stereoelectronic effects. In polygalacturonases, however, the glycosidic bonds of a substrate are inherently positioned axial in the relaxed form and the ring seems to be distorted to relieve the strain imposed on the bound conformation of a substrate. Role of the conserved residues There are eight residues strictly conserved in the polygalacturonase family of proteins.46 These include Asn157, Asp159, Asp180, Asp181, His202, Gly203, Arg235, and Lys237 (in PGA numbering), and are clustered at subsites À1 and 1 (Figure 2). Armand et al. performed site-directed mutagenesis on six charged residues, excluding Asn157 and Gly203, and prepared 14 mutated enzymes, all of which showed considerably reduced enzyme activity.21 Based on the biochemical data of the puri®ed mutants, they suggested that three Asp residues are directly involved in catalysis, the Arg and Lys residues in substrate binding and a histidine residue in maintaining the proper ionization state of the catalytic Asp180. The present study shows that this proposition is essentially correct and further suggests that all conserved non-glycine

Structures of Polygalacturonase and Its Complex

residues are involved in the intricate hydrogen bonding networks that facilitate catalysis (Figure 4). There are several hydrogen bonds to Asp159 and Asp181 that hold the catalytic water: Asp159 is hydrogen-bonded to the highly conserved Asp162 and the main-chain N atom, and Asp181 to Arg235 and Lys237, as well as Ser205 that also forms a hydrogen bond with Arg235. These interactions assist in tightly holding Asp159 and Asp181 in their proper positions and may increase the basicity of the two aspartate residues, which in turn makes the bound water more nucleophilic. The model shows that the strained conformation of the substrate is stabilized by several hydrogen bonds with the protein (Table 3). For the GalpAÀ1 residue, the carboxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to Ser208 and Lys237 and the 2-OH group to Asn157 at the opposite side. The carboxyl group of GalpA1 is hydrogen-bonded to Arg235 and Lys237, and O5 to His202. The function of Arg235 and Lys237 may be dual in that they assist substrate binding and increase catalytic ef®ciency. Strictly conserved His202 may in fact interact with the catalytic Asp180 instead of the substrate as modeled here, since it is ideally positioned to act as a proton pump for Asp180. The distance between the ring N of His202 and the carboxyl O Ê atom of Asp180 is 3.3 A in the current model, but the side-chains of both residues can move closer without clashing into other residues. Tyr270 is also conserved in most polygalacturonases and mutation of the equivalent Tyr291 in PGN resulted in considerably reduced catalytic ef®ciency.22 The explicit role of highly conserved Asn157 and Tyr270 has not been proposed previously. In the present model, the amino group of Asn157 is hydrogen-bonded to the 2-OH group and the Ê hydroxyl group of Tyr270 is close (3.2 A) to endoÀ1 cyclic O5 of GalpA . These interactions occurring on both sides of GalpAÀ1 may be important in catalysis. It has been shown that a hydrogen bonding interaction with the sugar 2-OH is important in glycosidase catalysis, contributing considerable energy to transition state stabilization.47 The interaction involving Tyr270, possibly a hydrogen bond, may have the same function. Similar interaction of a tyrosine residue has been observed in the xylanase-carbohydrate complex.43 Other subsites At subsites À2, À3 and 2, the GalpA residues are bound through the interactions occurring at both sides as well (Table 3). For GalpAÀ2, the carboxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to Lys105 and 2OH to Asn186; for GalpAÀ3, the carboxyl group to Arg212 and 3-OH to Lys105; for GalpA2, the carboxyl group to His156 and 2-OH to Lys261. In contrast, there is only one or no favorable interaction between the protein and the substrate at other distal subsites. At subsite À4, the carboxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to His110, but there are no amino acid residues near the OH groups at the

Structures of Polygalacturonase and Its Complex

873 Ala108 equivalent to Gln155 but no residue equivalent to Arg234. At subsite À5, Asn157, equivalent to His110 in PGA, interacts with the hydroxyl group. The difference at these three positions results in variation of the properties of subsites À4 and À5 in the two proteins. At subsite 2 of PGC, Arg199, equivalent to His156 of PGA, can form a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group. It is very likely that subsite 3 does not exist in PGC because its T4 loop equivalent to that containing Lys261 of PGA is considerably shorter than that of PGA and Ala305 occupies the position equivalent to Lys261. The modeled substrate ®ts well into PGN. Along the binding groove, PGA and PGN show signi®cant differences at six residues, including Ala108/ Tyr130, Gln128/Met150, Ala133/Gln155, Thr165/ Asn186, Asp231/Glu252 and Lys261/Asp282 for PGA/PGN. These are located near distal subsites except for the Gln128/Met150 pair. Met150 in PGN and the equivalent Phe175 in PGC, both without any hydrogen bonding potential, ®t to the junction of subsites À1 and À2 where the 3-OH and the carboxyl groups are present in close proximity. In the PGA model, the side-chain N atom of Gln128 is also Ê directed to the junction and separated by 3.2 A from the carboxyl O atom. However, the acceptor angle at the O atom is too acute for this interaction to be a decent hydrogen bond. The fact that Gln128 is not important for substrate binding in PGA may be supporting evidence that the present model is reliable. The bulky Tyr130 residue in place of Ala108 of PGA is located near subsite À4 but distant from the substrate. Gln155 in place of Ala133 of PGA is located beneath the À4 ring, and thus would clash into the ring in the crystal conformation. However, its side-chain can be rotated to the solvent region without dif®culty to avoid collision. In PGA, Thr165 cannot interact with substrate, but the equivalent Asn186 of PGN is hydrogen-bonded to 3-OH at the À4 site. In addition, His132 forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group, as the equivalent His110 does in PGA. Therefore, at subsite À4, the binding af®nity of PGN should be higher than that of PGA. The GalpAÀ5 residue is entirely exposed to the solvent region and subsite À5 may not exist in PGN as in PGA. In PGN Glu252 and Asp282 may perform the role of Lys261 at subsite 2/ 3 in PGA. Unlike Lys261, Glu252 of PGN can interact only with subsite 2 but not with subsite 3. At subsite 3 of PGN, Asp282 forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group. Therefore, it can be concluded that the maximum number of subsites in PGN is seven, ranging from À4 to 3. This contrasts with the provisionary subsite map of PGN by Benen et al.20 They analyzed the bond-cleavage frequencies using oligogalacturonates of different lengths, and proposed that there are at least seven subsites, ranging from À5 to 2 with an imaginary subsite 3. This comparative modeling study suggests that the binding clefts in polygalacturonases can accommodate maximally eight GalpA residues at subsites

opposite side. In the present model, there are no hydrogen bonding interactions to the pendant groups of the GalpA3 residue. However, the sidechain of Lys261, which is folded forming a hydrogen bond with Asp231 and which also interacts with GalpA2, may possibly assume an extended conformation to form hydrogen bonds with 2-OH of GalpA2 and the carboxyl group of GalpA3 simultaneously, because Lys261 is located at the terminus of the binding cleft and can thus reorient its side-chain easily. The binding af®nity at subsite 3 should be very weak even if it exists. The GalpAÀ5 residue is entirely exposed to the solvent region and can move freely. A model can be built such that its 2-OH group can interact with His110, but only at the expense of the interaction at subsite À4, which is very unlikely to occur. Frequently, the aromatic residues interact with the carbohydrate rings in the protein complexed with a carbohydrate, but there is no such interaction in PGA. A major shortcoming of the present study may be that the water-mediated interactions, which could be present in the real Michaelis complex, are completely ignored. In summary, the present model shows that there are at most seven subsites ranging from À4 to 3 in PGA. From the interaction modes modeled, it can be inferred that binding af®nity is strong at ®ve subsites from À3 to 2 and weak at subsite À4. Subsite 3 may barely be de®ned but subsite À5 does not exist. Modeling shows that the total length of the octagalacturonate does not change signi®cantly regardless of the ring distortion at subsite À1 and the local conformation of the helix, as long as the whole substrate remains close to the binding cleft. Thus, it is very likely that the total number of subsites and their positions presented in this study are correct, even if some individual interaction modes between the protein and substrate might not be modeled correctly. Complex models for other polygalacturonases The modeled octagalacturonate has been superimposed onto the structures of PGC10 and PGN11 to test its validity. As can be seen in Figure 2 and Table 3, the amino acid residues involved in substrate binding in PGA are mostly conserved in PGN, but not in PGC except for those in subsites À1 and 1. However, the modeled substrate could be docked into PGC without serious clashes although several side-chain conformations and glycosidic torsion angles had to be adjusted. The hydroxyl group of Tyr314, Ê equivalent to Tyr270 of PGA, is 5.9 A apart from O5 of GalpAÀ1 but can be brought closer by simply rotating the phenyl group. PGC shows signi®cant differences from PGA in the environment at distal subsites. PGC may have both subsites À4 and À5, whereas PGA does not have subsite À5. At subsite À4 of PGC, Gln155 interacts with the carboxyl group and Arg234 with the hydroxyl group. PGA has

874 from À5 to 3, but only six subsites from À4 to 2 are clearly de®ned. Subsite À5 or 3, mostly exposed to the solvent region, may or may not be shaped depending on the nearby amino acid residues. Both distal subsites have very weak binding af®nity, even if they exist. Binding af®nities of subsites À4 and 2 as well as À5 and 3 may also be different depending on the origin polygalacturonase. For example, subsites À4 and 3 in PGN may have a higher binding af®nity than those in PGA. Unlike the case of PGA and PGC, Tyr291 in the PGN complex could not participate in transition state stabilization because its phenol ring is directed to subsite 1 and the hydroxyl O atom is Ê about 8 A distant from O5 of GalpAÀ1 (Figure 2). Á Pages et al. made the mutants of Y291F and Y291L, and found that their transition state energies are considerably increased compared to the native enzyme.22 These results are consistent with our proposition about the role of the conserved Tyr270 in transition state stabilization. Although they recognized the important role of the hydroxyl function in catalysis, they still concluded that Tyr291 of PGN should be located at subsite 1 based on the crystal structure. Modeling indicates that Tyr291 is not so mobile because it is situated underneath the turn of the T1 loop. The phenolic side-chain can be rotated to shorten the distance between the Ê hydroxyl O and O5 atoms, but only up to 6 A due to the collision between the ring and Gly294 at the turn. Thus, it is very likely that, upon binding of the substrate, the ¯exible T1 loop of PGN may have to undergo, albeit not large, conformational change to bring Tyr291 closer to subsite À1. This movement of the loop would require extra energy compared to the case of PGA or PGC. It would be interesting to know whether the differences in the T1 loop structure would be re¯ected in the enzymatic reaction rates. To our knowledge comparison of the reaction rates of PGN and PGA has not been reported. If one had tried to build the complex model using the PGN structure, it would not be easy to derive the role of Tyr270 and the crystal structure of PGA seems to help in this regard. Á To assess the subsites of PGN, Pages et al. performed site-directed mutagenesis on the eight residues, presuming that they are lined up in the binding groove.22 They determined the kinetic parameters and the mode of action of the mutant enzymes, including M150Q, D183N, N186E, E252A, D282 K, Q288E, Y291F, Y291L, and Y326L. They found that the three mutants D183N, Y291F, and Y291L retained 12.8, 5 and 0.7 % of the wild-type activity, respectively, but the speci®c activities of the other mutants were still high, indicating that the mutations only slightly affected catalysis. They proposed that N186 is located at subsite À4, M150 and D183 at subsite À2 or at the junction of subsite À2 and subsite À1, Y291 at subsite 1, E252, D282 and Q288 at subsite 2, and Y326 at imaginary subsite 3. The reduction of catalytic ef®ciency for the enzymes mutated on Asp183 and Tyr291 is consist-

Structures of Polygalacturonase and Its Complex

ent with the present model in that they are involved in catalysis but not in substrate binding. Asp183, equivalent to Asp162 of PGA, assists in increasing the basicity of the nucleophile and Tyr291 stabilizes the transition state at subsite À1. The locations predicted for Met150, Asn186, and Glu252 are consistent with our model. However, Asp282 may contribute to subsite 3 instead of the proposed 2. The most signi®cant discrepancy between the prediction and the model is found for Gln288 and Tyr326. According to our model, they are far from the bound substrate and are incapable of interacting with the substrate. Even if the substrate could have been modeled in a bent or kinked chain, Tyr283 or the other residues in the long T1 loop would prevent the substrate from interacting with Gln288 and Tyr326. Attempts to make a kinked or a bent model for the octagalacturonate in the binding cleft failed because of the stringent restriction imposed on the GalpAÀ1-GalpA1 conformation, which also supports the contention that the essential features of the present subsite mapping may be correct. The amino acid residues that are suggested to be important in substrate binding may serve as targets for further site-directed mutagenesis.

Materials and Methods
Purification and crystallization PGA was puri®ed from a crude pectinase using the QSepharose, Superdex G-75 and DEAE-Sepharose columns (Pharmacia). A commercial Pectinex Ultra SP-L was a kind gift from Novo Nordisk Ferment Ltd. During puri®cation of PGA, various enzyme assays had to be carefully performed to remove pectinesterase, pectate lyase and pectin lyase which have similar physical properties to PGA. SDS-PAGE of puri®ed PGA showed a molecular mass of 43 kDa, higher than the value of 34.7 kDa estimated from the primary sequence, indicating that PGA may be an extensively glycosylated protein. The isoelectric point of PGA was measured to be in the range 4.24.6 by isoelectric focusing using the Phast System (Pharmacia). The puri®ed protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ ml by using a Centricon (Amicon). The crystallization conditions were initially screened using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with 3 ml drops (containing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions) equilibrated against 700 ml of reservoir solution. Two different crystal forms were obtained after re®ning crystallization conditions. Rectangularshaped crystals were grown in the microdialysis button with 45 % (v/v) 1,6-hexanediol, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) buffer, and 0.2 M ammonium acetate at room temperature. They grew to maximum dimensions of 0.2 mm Â 0.4 mm Â 1.0 mm in two weeks. Spearheadshaped crystals were grown in the hanging drops with 30 % (w/v) PEG 400, 0.02 M CdCl2 and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) at 4  C. They grew to maximum dimensions of 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 0.6 mm in two months. Data collection X-ray diffraction data for the native crystal at pH 8.5, and its four heavy-atom derivatives, and for the native crystal at pH 4.5 were collected at 18  C on an Enraf-

Nonius FAST area detector system coupled with a Rigaku RU-200 X-ray generator running at 45 kV and 70 mA. The data were processed with the MADNES software.48 The crystal at pH 8.5 belongs to orthorhombic P21212 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The calculated Ê Matthew's volume VM was 2.41 A3/Da and the solvent content was 49.0 %. The crystal at pH 4.5 belongs to monoclinic P21 with two molecules in the asymmetric Ê unit. The VM value was 2.22 A3/Da and the solvent content 45.0 %. The native crystals of both forms diffracted Ê to 2.0 A resolution. The details of the data collection are listed in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The structure of PGA was ®rst determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method with the crystal at pH 8.5 (Table 5). The heavy-atom positions in four heavy-atom derivatives were easily determined from the difference Patterson and cross-difference Fourier maps, and re®ned using the program SHARP.49 The initial MIR phases had an overall ®gure of merit of 0.67 Ê Ê in the resolution range of 20 A to 2.8 A. Phases were Ê improved by solvent ¯attening and extended to 2.0 A using the program Solomon.50 The resulting electron density map was clean and could be traced without dif®culty. Model building was done using the program x®t in the XtalView package.51 Re®nement was carried out using CNS52 with a positional re®nement followed by simulated annealing to 4000 K and ®nally an individual B-factor re®nement. Manual rebuilding was carried out between each run with the sA-weighted 2Fo À Fc maps. Carbohydrate and water molecules were included in the structure if the density appeared in both the 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron density maps. When the entire protein molecule was traced and all carbohydrate residues were included, a bulk solvent correction was performed using all data. Additional solvent molecules were Ê included if their B-factors did not exceed 60 A2 after re®nements. During the ®nal stages of the re®nement, the maximum likelihood method implemented in the program Refmac53 was used to re®ne atomic positions

and isotropic B-factors with the bulk solvent correction terms from CNS. The value of Rfree, calculated with a randomly chosen 5 % of the observed data for every re®nement cycle, was consistently monitored to validate the re®ned structure. The ®nal crystallographic R and Rfree values were 16.5 % for 21,845 and 21.3 % for 1181 unique re¯ections (F > 2s), respectively. The structure of the pH 4.5 crystal form was solved using the standard molecular replacement protocol in CNS. The re®ned MIR structure was used as a search model. The rotational search, carried out with data Ê between 15.0 and 4.0 A and center of mass cutoff at Ê 30 A, produced two cross-rotational solutions for the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. These were consistent with non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry obtained from the self-rotation function. The translation vectors for the two rotation solutions were easily obtained. The resulting model gave an R-factor of 37.4 % after rigid-body re®nement. Further re®nements were carried out in a fashion similar to that described above. The ®nal crystallographic R and Rfree values were 17.8 % for 32,101 and 22.6 % for 1689 unique re¯ections (F > 2s), respectively. Modeling of the complex The oligosaccharide has a very ¯exible conformation. Each pyranose ring may have various chair, boat, skew, half-chair, and envelope forms due to puckering.39 In addition each glycosidic linkage and the pendant groups have considerable rotational degrees of freedom. Therefore, an exhaustive search in docking an oligosaccharide into the protein is computationally formidable. The modeling in this study was performed in a stepwise manner. First the digalacturonate was ¯exibly docked into the protein. Then the additional GalpA residues were gradually joined to both reducing and non-reducing ends and the models were subjected to MD simulations and energy minimization. This process was repeated until the oligomer covered the entire surface of the binding cleft. Several digalacturonate models with various ring conformations that may possibly conform to the mechanism

876
were built and docked into the protein using AutoDock 3.054 that maximizes the favorable interactions allowing digalacturonate ¯exibility. All water molecules except the catalytic one were removed from the protein and the hydrogen atoms were generated using CNS. Ten torsion angles in digalacturonate were optimized using a genetic algorithm. Numerous AutoDock solutions were screened from the consideration of conformability to the inverting mechanism in conjunction with the active site topology of PGA and also the possibility of decent interactions with the protein for the additional GalpA residues joined to both ends. The most plausible solutions were obtained from the chair (4C1)-chair, half-chair (4H3)-chair and envelope (E3)-chair conformers that correspond to GalpAÀ1-GalpA1. The digalacturonate models containing the skew or boat conformation were discarded, since they move the leaving group from the favorable axial position to the equatorial position. For each of the AutoDock conformers, the GalpA residues, either in the 21 or in the 31 helical conformation, were gradually joined to make a trimer and then a pentamer model. The resulting complex models were subjected to MD simulation and energy minimization using the AMBER 6.0 package.55 Only the side-chain atoms of the residues (91 in total) that line the binding cleft and the main-chain atoms of several loop regions near the binding site were allowed to move while the others were ®xed during the simulations. MD simulations could not be conducted straightforwardly and different protocols had to be used depending on the chain length. Typical MD protocols are as follows. For a trimer from À2 to 1, the temperature was raised from 0 to 500 K in 5 ps and equilibrated for 6 ps, and then slowly cooled to 300 K in 2 ps and equilibrated for 10 ps with a time step of 1 fs. Subsequent to MD simulation, the energy was minimized with steepest descent until the gradient norm became smaller than 0.02. For a pentamer from À3 to 2, the temperature was raised from 0 to 300 K in 3 ps and equilibrated for 10 ps. Since the distorted ring was converted to a chair during MD simulations, the torsional constraints were applied to maintain a distorted form. Occasionally some pendant groups in the sugar ring were ¯ipped to the disfavored axial positions. Only the pentamer models that have all pendant groups in the equatorial positions and favorable interaction modes with the protein were used for further model building. Any model larger than a pentamer was unstable during MD simulations, the distal GalpA residues escaping from the binding cleft. Therefore, only the energy minimization was performed for several PGA-octagalacturonate complex models that were manually built based on the optimized pentamer models. Finally, three different PGA-octamer complex models, with the À1 ring in a chair, a half-chair or an envelope form, were obtained as the most plausible solutions. Among these, a half-chair model was chosen as the best solution from the perspective of conformational viability of the GalpAÀ1-GalpA1 segment and adequacy of the interaction modes with the protein side-chains.
