Structure and in vivo function of Hsp90 Laurence H Pearl* and Chrisostomos Prodromou
Until recently, Hsp90 was one of the least well understood of the molecular chaperones, but considerable progress is now being made in unravelling its biochemistry. Hsp90 has now been shown to possess an inherent ATPase that is essential for the activation of authentic `client' proteins in vivo and in vitro. The molecular detail of Hsp90's interactions with co-chaperones is also becoming clearer and the identification of key roles in assembling regulatory and signalling pathways has made it a target for anticancer drug development. Despite this, a clear understanding of how Hsp90 contributes to the folding and/or activation of its client proteins remains some way off.

ATPase-dependent activation of a biologically authentic Hsp90 client protein [6ии] has recently been reported. In this review, we attempt to summarise current knowledge of the structure and function of Hsp90 and its expanding set of co-chaperones, and their interactions in the Hsp90based chaperone system. We also review progress in defining the client range of Hsp90 and the nature of its interactions with client proteins, and discuss the emergence of Hsp90 as a target for the structure-aided design of new anticancer drugs. Hsp90s consist of a highly conserved, 25 kDa N-terminal domain connected to a highly conserved, 55 kDa C-terminal region by a `charged linker', which is variable in both length and composition among species and isoforms. The charged linker is not essential for Hsp90 function and is entirely absent in mammalian Hsp75/TRAP1 and bacterial HtpG. Crystal structures have been determined for the isolated N-terminal (N) domains of human and yeast Hsp90s, and for N-domain complexes with nucleotides and inhibitors (see below) [2,5и,7,8и,9], but no structures have been reported to date for an intact Hsp90 or for any C-terminal fragments. A medium-resolution map for an intact bacterial HtpG has been obtained (D Agard, personal communication) and a structure is keenly anticipated; however, as the biology of the nonessential bacterial HtpGs is quite different from that of the eukaryotic Hsp90s, being dispensable for normal growth and lacking obvious co-chaperones, the insights into eukaryotic Hsp90 function that can be drawn from HtpG will be limited and crystal structures of eukaryotic Hsp90s and their co-chaperone and client complexes are still urgently required. The crystal structure of the yeast Hsp90 N-domain with bound nucleotide [2] revealed structural homology between Hsp90s and the type II topoisomerase DNA gyrase B, with the conservation of residues involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Further members have been added to this unusual family of ATP-binding domains with the structure determinations of an N-terminal fragment of the MutL DNA mismatch repair protein [10,11и] and a Cterminal fragment of the bacterial histidine kinase CheA [12]. In Hsp90, DNA gyrase and MutL, the ATP-binding domain forms the N terminus, whereas in CheA (and other histidine kinases) it is embedded in the middle of the polypeptide chain.

Structural studies of Hsp90

Introduction
The eukaryotic Hsp90s are essential and ubiquitous molecular chaperones with key roles in the folding, activation and assembly of a range of client proteins typically involved in signal transduction, cell cycle control or transcriptional regulation (reviewed in [1]). Hsp90s functionally interact with a set of co-chaperones, whose number continues to increase, but whose biochemical roles in Hsp90-dependent protein activation largely remain obscure. In eubacteria, an Hsp90 homologue (HtpG) is identifiable in almost all the genomes so far available but, unlike its eukaryotic counterpart, it lacks any obvious cochaperones and is dispensable for normal growth. Much of the earliest biochemical literature on Hsp90 concentrated on its ability in isolation to slow the in vitro aggregation of a variety of proteins, none of which were known to be Hsp90-dependent in vivo. In parallel, studies of the Hsp90-dependent activation of authentic client proteins could only be achieved in much more complex systems, such as reticulocyte lysates, for which the attribution of Hsp90-specific phenomena was difficult, and a dichotomous literature developed. Following the landmark demonstration of ATP binding by Hsp90 in vitro [2,3] and the identification of an essential role for ATP binding and hydrolysis in Hsp90 function in vivo [4ии,5и], a more unified approach to Hsp90 biochemistry has begun to emerge and the first demonstration in vitro of the Hsp90

Hsp90 biochemistry
Although the ATP dependence of Hsp90 function in vitro [2,3] and in vivo [4ии,5и] has now been established beyond doubt, the role of the ATPase in Hsp90's biochemical function is far from clear. ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, reduces the affinity of Hsp90 for hydrophobic resins [6ии],

suggesting that a change in Hsp90 conformation occurs. Direct evidence for conformational changes associated with the ATPase has recently come from an electron microscopy study using regiospecific antibodies [13ии]. Hsp90 dimers, which are inherently dimerised via the C terminus, appear as linear antiparallel structures with only C-terminal dimerisation contacts in the absence of ATP. On addition of ATP and/or at elevated temperatures, parallel toroidal structures, in which both the N and C termini are in dimeric contact, were observed. The formation of these toroidal Hsp90 structures on addition of ATP was inefficient in this study and further work will be required to determine the significance of the observation. A mechanism by which ATP binding promotes the association of the N termini would have considerable appeal, however, as this is precisely the effect of ATP binding on DNA gyrase B [14] and MutL [11и], and this would indicate a common function for these systems as ATPase-coupled molecular clamps (Figure 1). What role such a mechanism would play in Hsp90-dependent activation of its client proteins remains to be discovered.

[PP5/Ppt1]). The crystal structure of the TPR domain from PP5 [17ии] revealed a compact helical domain of six consecutive  helices arranged in a regular right-handed superhelix, generating an amphipathic groove that is capable of interacting with 7Г12 residues of polypeptide (Figure 2). In support of this role, the mutation of some of the residues lining this groove in the PP5 TPR domain abrogates interaction with Hsp90 [18и]. Several studies have localised the primary binding site for TPR domains to the C terminus of Hsp90, with the conserved C-terminal motif MEEVD being particularly important [18и,19,20и,21и]. Competition between p60/Hop/Sti1 and other TPR-domain-containing co-chaperones had generally been interpreted as indicating the presence of a single TPR-domain-binding site in the Hsp90 dimer. Direct measurement of the binding of the yeast TPR-containing co-chaperones Cpr6 (Cyp40) and Sti1 (p60/Hop) by Hsp90 using isothermal titration calorimetry [22ии] shows a clear molar ratio of one TPRcontaining co-chaperone per Hsp90 monomer, however, indicating that the Hsp90 dimer provides binding sites for two TPR-containing co-chaperones. The observed mutual exclusion of p60/Hop/Sti1 and immunophilins thus results from the stable dimeric structure of p60/Hop/Sti1 [22ии], which occupies both TPR-binding sites simultaneously. The presence of two TPR-binding sites per Hsp90 dimer is further supported by the observation that the selective precipitation of the yeast immunophilin Cpr7 also brings down the TPR-containing co-chaperone Cns1 [23и,24и]. The presence of the two equivalent TPR-binding sites offered by an Hsp90 dimer raises the possibility of a very diverse set of Hsp90 complexes being present in the cell. Thus, different pairwise combinations of TPR-containing co-chaperones may be present in complexes with different client proteins and at different stages of their interaction with the Hsp90-based apparatus. The picture has been further complicated by recent studies of p50cdc37, an Hsp90 co-chaperone required for recruiting Hsp90-depen-

Hsp90 interactions with co-chaperones
On its own, Hsp90 is incapable of promoting the folding and/or activation of any of its known client proteins in vitro. For steroid hormone receptors, the minimal requirement for achieving a steroid-binding conformation in vitro is Hsp90, Hsp70 and p60/Hop/Sti1 [6ии,15,16], with the presence of Hsp40 and p23 providing improved `yield'. In vivo, Hsp90 potentially interacts with 10 or more different cochaperones, as well as with Hsp70 and its co-chaperones, which constitute a chaperone system in their own right. A subset of these co-chaperones contains multiple copies of a degenerate 34-residue motif known as a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR). TPR domains may be fused to other TPR domains (as in p60/Hop/Sti1 or Cns1), to a peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPI) domain (as in Hsp90-binding immunophilins such as Cyp40 and FKBP52) or even to a phosphatase domain (as in protein phosphatase 5
Figure 1 The conformational switch in Hsp90. Binding of ATP (A) or heat shock [13ии] converts Hsp90 from a form in which the two N-terminal domains are separate in the dimer to one in which they are associated, generating a toroidal dimer structure. An essentially identical ATP-dependent `clamp' mechanism operates in DNA gyrase B [14] and MutL [11и], both of which have similar Nterminal ATP-binding domains to Hsp90. The conserved C-terminal MEEVD motif is involved in the binding of TPR-domaincontaining co-chaperones.

Cns1, was identified in screens for multicopy suppressors of cpr7Г strains [23и,24и] and also in a screen for multicopy suppressors of Hsp90 ts missense mutations [30и]. Unlike the other TPR-containing co-chaperones, Cns1 is essential for cell viability [23и,24и] and may be a specific component of Hsp90 complexes with Cpr7. Hch1 was also identified as a multicopy suppressor of ts missense mutations in Hsp90 [30и], but its role in Hsp90 function is yet to be determined. It possesses no obvious TPR domains and, although human and C. elegans homologues can be identified, these are also of unknown function. Undoubtedly there remain further Hsp90 co-chaperones to be discovered and the biochemical function of those already known is still to be understood. p60/Hop/Sti1 serves partly as a scaffold to couple Hsp70 and Hsp90 complexes [27], but also acts to inhibit the inherent ATPase activity of Hsp90 in the early stages of client protein activation [22ии]. p23/Sba1 becomes associated with Hsp90 only in its ATP-bound state, but its role is not clear. Neither of these co-chaperones is essential for cell viability in yeast at normal growth temperatures. At first sight, the biochemical functions of the TPR-containing immunophilins and PP5/Ppt1 appear obvious, as they contain PPI and protein phosphatase enzymatic domains, respectively; however, at least for the yeast immunophilin Cpr7, the catalytic PPI domain is entirely dispensable and full Cpr7 function can be achieved with only the TPR domain [31].

dent protein kinases, such as Raf-1, into Hsp90 complexes [25]. Although lacking any discernible TPRs, p50cdc37 binding to Hsp90 is also excluded by the presence of p60/Hop/Sti1 or intact PP5, but not by the isolated PP5 TPR domain [26], suggesting that p50cdc37-binding site(s) on Hsp90 are adjacent to, but not overlapping with, those for TPR domains. The stoichiometry of p50cdc37 binding to Hsp90 is yet to be determined. The binding of p60/Hop/Sti1, which recruits Hsp70/Hsp40 into complexes with Hsp90 [27], is closely coupled with the ATPase cycle of Hsp90. p60/Hop/Sti1 binds preferentially to Hsp70 or Hsp90 in the presence of ADP [28]. Although the presence of p60/Hop/Sti1 has no effect on the ATPase activity of Hsp70, it strongly inhibits the Hsp90 ATPase [22ии], promoting a change in Hsp90 conformation and interacting directly with the ATP-binding site in the N domain [22ии]. In contrast, the mammalian p23 protein and its yeast homologue Sba1, which do not contain TPR domains, only interact with ATP-bound Hsp90 [5и,6ии,29]. Thus, although the primary binding sites for p60/Hop/Sti1 and p23/Sba1 are quite different [20и], binding of p60/Hop/Sti1 and p23/Sba1 to Hsp90 is mutually exclusive as a result of their association with the early and late stages of the Hsp90 ATPase cycle, respectively. The list of Hsp90 co-chaperones has continued to expand, with 10 now identified in yeast (Hsp70/Ssa, Hsp40/Ydj1, p23/Sba1, Cpr6, Cpr7, Sti1, Cns1, Ppt1, Cdc37p and Hch1). The newest addition to the TPR-containing co-chaperones,

Client protein specificity
Unlike the better-characterised Cpn60s and Hsp70s, which are essentially involved in protein folding in general, Hsp90 displays considerable specificity for its client proteins. The best-studied class of Hsp90-dependent proteins is the cytoplasmic receptors for glucocorticoid, progesterone and, to a lesser extent, oestrogen, whose hormone-receptive state is maintained by dynamic association with Hsp90 and cochaperones (reviewed in [32]). Interaction with Hsp90 is a function of the hormone-binding domain of the steroid hormone receptors, but attempts to localise the interaction region further have produced inconsistent results [33,34]. Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family are also well known for their dependence on Hsp90, but with a confusing selectivity among closely related proteins. Thus, Hsp90 was found to associate with oncogenic v-Src, v-Yes and v-Fps, but not with their normal cellular homologues; however, studies in yeast [35и] have now shown that both v-Src and cSrc depend on interaction with Hsp90 for maturation and activation, albeit to different degrees, and suggest that most, if not all, Src-family kinases are Hsp90 clients. Recent studies of the Src-family kinase p56lck have shown that folding and activation is modular, with only the catalytic domain, not the SH2 domain, being dependent on Hsp90 [36]. Kinase interaction with Hsp90 is mediated by p50cdc37, which acts as an adaptor protein, interacting with the catalytic domain of kinases via its conserved N terminus and with Hsp90 via C-terminal regions [25,26].

The known range of client proteins continues to extend, with Hsp90 now implicated in the maturation and activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator [37], nitric oxide synthase [38] and telomerase [39]. The ERspecific Hsp90 homologue GRP94 is implicated in the stabilisation of the Fanconi anaemia group C protein [40]. Particularly important was the discovery that Hsp90 plays a direct role in the regulation of the heat-shock response by sequestering heat-shock transcription factors in an inactive complex that is disrupted by heat shock [41ии,42,43]. The key role played by Hsp90 in folding, activating and assembling components of many cell cycle regulatory and signal transduction pathways has profound implications for the evolution of these systems. In a landmark paper, Rutherford and Lindquist [44ии] showed that Hsp90 buffers an enormous amount of cryptic genetic variation by assisting mutant client proteins to nonetheless maintain a `wild-type' structure and function. When Hsp90 function is impaired by temperature sensitivity or by enzymatic inhibition (see below), the cryptic phenotypes of the mutant client proteins manifest and a new pool of variation becomes available for natural selection.

kinases such as v-Src and ErbB-2. Similar antitumour properties were described for the unrelated compound radicicol (monorden), which was able to revert the tumour phenotype of src and ras transformed cell lines. In both cases, the cellular activity of the compounds was attributed to the direct inhibition of protein kinase activity, but this proved difficult to demonstrate in vitro. Subsequently, it has been shown that the actual target of both these drugs is Hsp90 [45,46] and that their cellular activity results from disruption of the Hsp90-dependent activation of the client protein (see [38,47,48] for recent examples). The binding site on Hsp90 for geldanamycin and radicicol is located in the N-terminal domain [3,8и,9,49] and colocalises with the ATP-binding site of Hsp90 [2]; both compounds are competitive inhibitors of the inherent ATPase activity of Hsp90 [4ии,8и,49,50]. Structural analysis of geldanamycin and radicicol bound to the N-terminal domain of yeast Hsp90 [8и] (Figure 3) has revealed remarkable nucleotide mimicry by these antibiotics, in terms of both shape complementarity and the interactions they make with the Hsp90 protein itself and with the tightly bound water molecules implicit in the structure of the nucleotide-binding pocket. The essential involvement of Hsp90 in the activation of important antitumour targets, such as Raf-1, Src-family kinases, Cdk4 and so on, makes Hsp90 itself an attractive target and there is growing interest in clinical applications

Whatever the outcome of `antichaperone' drug development, the availability of these specific Hsp90 inhibitors has been and will continue to be invaluable in unravelling the biochemistry and in vivo function of the Hsp90-based molecular chaperone system.

Conclusions
The biochemistry of Hsp90 has undergone a substantial re-evaluation. Hsp90 is now understood to be an active ATP-dependent chaperone involved in the assembly and regulation of signal transduction pathways by activating specific client proteins. The `passive chaperone' role ascribed by previous in vitro studies with isolated Hsp90 and nonauthentic client proteins probably has little bearing on the real in vivo activity of Hsp90 with authentic clients. This activity is highly dependent on an increasingly large family of co-chaperones, which act at different stages of and partly regulate the Hsp90 ATPase cycle. The biochemical roles of the co-chaperones in the Hsp90 complex are very poorly described, but are the key to future understanding of the mechanism by which Hsp90 activates client proteins.

Cell 1998, 94:471-480. Hsp90 is shown to have a direct role in the regulation of the heat-shock response. It forms a complex with the heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 and maintains it in a monomeric inactive form, which is released on heat shock. 42. Ali A, Bharadwaj S, O'Carroll R, Ovsnek N: Hsp90 interacts with and regulates the activity of heat shock factor 1 in Xenopus oocytes. Mol Cell Biol 1998, 18:4949-4960. 43. Duina AA, Kalton HM, Gaber RF: Requirement for Hsp90 and a CyP-40-type cyclophilin in negative regulation of the heat shock response. J Biol Chem 1998, 273:18974-18978. 44. Rutherford SL, Lindquist S: Hsp90 as a capacitor for morphological ии evolution. Nature 1998, 396:336-342. The impairment of Hsp90 function produces dramatic changes in the morphological development of Drosophila, revealing cryptic genetic variation whose phenotypes are suppressed by Hsp90, thus assisting the maintenance of `wild-type' structure and function. 45. Whitesell L, Mimnaugh EG, Decosta B, Myers CE, Neckers LM: Inhibition of heat-shock protein Hsp90-Pp60(V-Src) heteroprotein complex-formation by benzoquinone ansamycins -- essential role for stress proteins in oncogenic transformation.

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1999, 96:1409-1414. Cns1 (see [23и,24и]) was identified in a different genetic screen with Hsp90 ts mutants, which also identified Hch1 -- a new non-TPR-containing co-chaperone. 31. Duina AA, Marsh JA, Kurtz RB, Chang H-CJ, Lindquist S, Gaber RF: The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain of the Cyp-40 cyclophilin homolog Cpr7 is not required to support growth or glucocorticoid receptor activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1999, 96:109-114. An in vivo study that demonstrates conclusively that, as for oncogenic v-Src, the activation of normal cellular Src kinase (and probably other Src-family kinases) is Hsp90-dependent.
