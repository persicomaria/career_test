The crystal structure of oncomodulin, a 12,000 Mr protein isolated from rat tumours, has been determined by molecular replacement using the carp parvalbumin structure as a starting model. Refinement was performed by cycles of molecular fitting and restrained least-squares, using area-detector intensity data to 1.85A resolution. For the 5770 reflections in the range 6"0 to 1"85 A, which were used in the refinement, the crystallographic R-factor is 0"166. The refined model includes residues 2 to 108, three Ca 2+ and 87 water molecules per oncomodulin molecule. The oncomodulin backbone is closely related to that of parvalbumin; however, some differences are found after a least-squares fit of the two backbones, with root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations of 1 to 2 A in residues 2 to 6, 59 to 61 of the CD loop, 87, 90 and 108. The overall r.m.s, deviation of the backbone residues 5 to 108 is 0.62A. Each of the two Ca 2+ atoms that are bound to the CD and EF loops is co-ordinated to seven oxygen atoms, including one water molecule. The third Ca 2+ is also seven-co-ordinated, to five oxygen atoms belonging to three different oncomodulin molecules and to two water molecules which form hydrogen bonds to a fourth oncomodulin; thus, this intermolecular Ca 2+ and its equivalents interlink the molecules into zigzag layers normal to the b axis with a spacing of b/2 or 32"14 A. No such extensive molecular aggregation has been reported for any of the related Ca-binding regulatory proteins of the troponin-C family studied thus far. The Ca-O distances in all three polyhedra are in the range 2"07/~ to 2.64 A, indicating tightly bound Ca polyhedra.

I. I n t r o d u c t i o n

Oncomodulin is a small (108 residues, Mr= 12,000) acidic protein originally isolated from rat hepatomas (MacManus, 1979, 1980), which appears early in the carcinogenic process (Bernaert et al., 1989). It is found in placenta tissue (Brewer & MacManus, 1985, 1987; Brewer et at., 1989), and in a majority of tumour cells, but cannot be detected in normal adult human or rodent tissues (MacManus & Whitfield, 1983; MaeManus et al., 1987). Neither the function of oncomodulin during normal development nor its role during carcinogenesis is understood, but it is a member of the troponin-C family of calcium-binding regulatory proteins, which play an important role in several biological p r o c e s s e s (Strynadka & James, 1989). The amino acid sequence of rat oncomodulin is homologous to the parvalbumins, but more like a /~-parvalbumin than mammalian muscle ~-parvalbumin (MacManus et al., 1983a,b; Gillen et al., 1987). The parvalbumins have two Ca2+/Mg2+-binding sites (Strynadka & James, 1989). Despite the simi0022-2836/90/200127-14 $03.00/0

larity to parvalbumin in primary structure, oncomodulin is noteworthy in apparently having a calcium-specific site and exhibiting positive cooperativity of metal binding (MacManus et a/., 1984, 1989; Williams et al., 1987). It has the capability of activating enzymes such as phosphodiesterase and calcineurin in a calcium-dependent manner (MacManus, 1981; Mutus et at., 1985, 1988). The protein can also inhibit enzymes such as glutathione reductase (Palmer et at., 1990). A detailed analysis of the crystal structure of oncomodulin was undertaken in order to provide basic information aimed at understanding its function and behaviour. The material was isolated from Morris Hepatoma 5123tc extract; suitable crystals were grown at 20°C by the hanging drop vapour diffusion technique (Przybylska et a/., 1988), and were identified as orthorhombic, s p a c e group P212121, unit cell lengths a -- 39"59(1) A, b = 64"28(2) A, c = 33-07(1) A (1 A = 0.1 nm), with o n e molecule in the asymmetric unit (Z--4). A meeting abstract on the crystal structure was reported b y Ahmed et at. (1989). 127

(a) Data collection Crystals of the native oncomodulin occur in the form of thin needles, up to 1.5 mm long and up to 0.2 mm in thickness (Przybylska et a/., 1988). The unit cell axial lengths were measured on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer, while the X-ray intensity data were obtained from 3 crystals mounted in capillaries with the needle axis (c*) along the capillary. The main data set, from a crystal 1-10mm × 0"15mm x 0"15mm, was measured to 1"85~ resolution on a multiwire area detector (Xuong eta/., 1985) at the University of North Carolina, using Cu radiation at 40 kV and 50 mA. There were 6 orientation runs, 4 at high resolution 5"0 to 1"8 A and 2 at low resolution 11"0 to 2"6 A, with exposures taken at 0"12° intervals for 30 s per frame. The set contained 17,879 observations corresponding to 6479 unique reflections, with an internal discrepancy R(3)~f= 0-042 on the intensities. In addition, diffractometer data were measured from 2 different crystals, each 0-73 m m × 0"13 m m × 0"13 mm: I set to 3"0 A resolution was used as a guide to the quality of the data; the 2nd supplemented the area detector data set. Since there was good agreement among the 3 data sets, the gaps in the (main) area detector data set were filled in with diffractometer data to give 5965 unique observed reflections with I > 3a(I). Of these, 5578 were area detector data, and 387 were diffractometer data. The data were corrected for background and Lorentz and polarization effects, but not for absorption. (b) Structure determination The crystal structure was determined by the molecular replacement procedure (Rossmann, 1972) with the aid of a self-consistent set of programs assembled by A.R. Sielecki and implemented in this laboratory by M. Cygler. The set includes the following programs: FFTSF to calculate structure factors by fast Fourier transform (S. J. Remington & L . F . Ten Eyck); YORROT to apply Crowther's (1972) algorithm for fast rotational search (E. Dodson); BRUTE for the translation search (Fujinaga & Read, 1987); TRANSF to derive the transformed atomic co-ordinates. The starting model was carp muscle parvalbumin (Kretsinger & Nockolds, 1973; Moews & Kretsinger, 1975) as refined by Kumar et al. (1990). It was chosen because of its close resemblance to oncomodulin; both molecules are Ca-binding proteins with 108 residues, and have 50% identity in their amino acid sequence. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of oncomodulin with carp parvalbumin is shown in Fig. 1. Structure factors for the assumed model were calculated with the 812 non-hydrogen atoms of parvalbumin placed in a unit cell in the form of a cube of axial length 70 A, P1 symmetry. Parvalbumin itself has the general shape of an ellipsoid with principal diameters of 36 A, 30 A and 30 A (Kretsinger & Nockolds, 1973). Rotation searches, performed under differing conditions, produced strong indications for 1 orientation CA) and only moderate indications for 2 others (B1 and B2). Translation searches, evaluated for the 3 possible orientations, gave a significantly higher correlation:

Refinement of the orientation and translation parameters from solution A resulted in a very good correlation factor of 0"63 for the 376 reflections in the 10 to 5 A resolution range. (c) Structure refinement A starting model for oncomodulin was derived by orienting the parvalbumin molecule and placing it in the oncomodulin unit cell, according to the parameters derived from solution A, then substituting some of the amino acid residues as needed to make it fit the oncomodulin sequence. A few cycles of preliminary refinement by restrained least-squares (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1981), using the program PROLSQ (Hendrickson, 1985), resulted in an R ~ I F o - F J ~ I F o O of 0"38 for 5730 reflections (area detector data only) in the 6-0 to 1-85 A resolution range. An overall isotropic temperature factor of 12 Az was assumed for the 851 non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule. Further refinement of the molecular model was carried out in 17 rounds, each consisting of model-fitting to electron density maps followed by cycles of restrained least-squares refinement. The fittings were performed on an Evans & Sutherland PS-330 computer graphics system on-line to a VAX 11/750, using the Rice/Baylor version (6"4) of FRODO (Jones, 1978). Both electron density maps with amplitudes (2Fo-Fc) and difference maps with amplitudes (Fo--F~) were examined. For the 5770 reflections in the 6"0 to 1-85 A resolution range, which were used in the refinement, the R-factor was reduced to 0-265 with 1 overall isotropic temperature factor (B -- 1l'0 A2) but without water molecules, and eventually to 0-166 with individual isotropic temperature factors including 87 water molecules. Only the amino-terminal atoms of Serl were excluded since they could not be located in the electron density maps. The R-factor is 0-179 for the 5965 reflections in the 10-0 to 1-85 A resolution range. In the final stages of refinement, one of the water molecules, O-135, showed some anomalies indicative of it being a calcium ion instead. I t appeared much stronger in the electron density maps, its temperature factor refined to B < 2"0 A2, and it was surrounded by 7 oxygen atoms

This atom was ace epted as a Ca ~+ and refined as such; the difference map indicated that the site may be only 80% occupied and this was confirmed by further refinement. Refined atomic parameters and the structure factor data for oncomodulin have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Chemistry Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973.

(a) Quality of the model The present model includes residues 2 to 108, two intramolecular and one intermotecular Ca ions, and 87 water molecules for a total of 930 non-hydrogen atoms. Only the N-terminal residue Serl was not identifiable on the maps and was excluded. The final (2Fo-F¢) electron density map was of generally good quality as illustrated in the three sample portions shown in Figure 2(a), (b) and (c). The OG atoms of Ser7 and Ser84 may be disordered, but only their predominant positions were accepted.

As shown in Figure 3, Asn91 and the terminal Serl08 are the only non-glycyl residues of oncomodulin that have ¢ and ~b values that fall outside the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran et al., 1963). The D helix in oncomodulin has a kink at residue 65, similar to that in carp parvalbumin. Excluding this residue, the other 56 a-helical residues identified in Figure 1 have average torsion angles ( ¢ ) = -- 62 ° and (~b) =--41 °, which are very similar to the mean (~b,~b) values ( - 6 3 °, - 4 0 °) in actinidin (Baker, 1980) and crambin (Hendrickson & Teeter, 1981), and ( - 61°, _ 4 3 o) in baboon a-lactalbumin (Acharya et al., 1989).

values for a-helices in the 61 globular proteins considered by McGregor et al. (1987) are - 6 6 ° and - 4 1 °" The distribution of X1 torsion angles of the sidechains in oncomodulin, shown by the histogram in Figure 4, has the expected trimodal distribution with peaks at - 6 0 °, +60 ° and 180° corresponding to the three energetically favourable staggered conformations (Janin et al., 1978). The most populous region is the peak around - 6 0 °, as observed also in baboon a-lactalbumin. (b) Molecular structure Rat oncomodulin consists of a single polypeptide chain of 108 residues, and contains six a-helices A " " F and two calcium-binding loops known as the CD and E F loops, as identified in Figure 1. These two loops are approximately related by a noncrystallographic, pseudo 2-fold rotation axis, and are held together in antiparallel fl-sheets by the two intramolecular hydrogen bonds N - 5 8 - H " " 0-97 and N-97-H'-'O-58, which have N ' - - O distances of 2"73 A and 2-76 ,~, respectively. Each of the Ca ions in the CD and E F loops is co-ordinated to seven oxygen atoms, including one water molecule, to form a slightly distorted pentagonal bipyramid around the calcium. A third Ca ion with 80% occupancy was discovered in the crystal structure, as mentioned above. It is co-ordinated to seven oxygen atoms in the form of a pentagonal bipyramid very similar to that of the CD loop, but in this case two of the vertices are water molecules. However, its coordination polyhedron is intermolecular, linking directly three different oncomodulin molecules and indirectly a fourth molecule through two hydrogen bonds, as shown in Figure 5. The seven oxygen atoms of the" polyhedron are Gln71 OE1, Asp73 OD1, Asp73 OD2 of the molecule with fractional coordinates (x, y, z); Gln54 OE1 a t (½+x, ½ - y , 2 - z ) ;

Glu79 OEl at (½+x, ½ - y , 1-z); and the two water molecules 169 and 172. The two hydrogen bonds are formed from the two water molecules to the carboxyl oxygen Asp92 0 at (1 +x, y, z). Thus, each Ca-135 links one pair of protein molecules with a unit cell separation along x and another pair with a unit cell separation along z, as shown in Figure 6(a). Consequently, Ca-135 and its symmetrically related equivalents in the crystal structure link the oncomodulin molecules into continuous zigzag layers normal to the b axis, with interlayer spacing of b/2 or 32"14 A between them, as illustrated in the two projections in Figure 6. The relevant interatomic distances and interligand angles of the three Ca-O polyhedra are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Figure 7 is a view of the rat oncomodulin backbone, showing all the Ca ions that are bonded to the molecule. (c) Temperature factors Two plots depicting the mean isotropic temperature factors of the backbone atoms (N, C~, C and O), and of the side-chain atoms are shown in Figure 8(a) and (b), respectively. The lowest mean temperature factors in the backbone (5"7 to 6"1 A 2) are for residues 70 to 79, which encompass the loop between the D and E helices, where there are four direct linkages from the intermolecular Ca2+-135 to 0E1(71), 0D1(73), OD2(73) and 0E1'(79) (at ½+x, ½--y, l--z). The temperature factor of Ca-135 is 4.92 A 2, and its Ca-O bonds are of lengths 2-07 to 2-64A indicating a tightly bound co-ordination. The two Ca ions of the CD and EF loops have relatively low temperature factors of 4-4 A 2 and 5-8 A2, respectively. Their co-ordination polyhedra are also tightly bound, with short Ca-O bond lengths of only 2"20 to 2"51 A. The highest average backbone temperature factors are in the range 11"3 to 15"9 A 2 for residues 2 to 9 and 103 to 108 at the two ends of the peptide chain. The mean temperature factors of the side-chain atoms are highest for Glu25, ( B ) = 27"0 A 2, and Arg48, ( B ) = 26"7 A2. The end atoms in these two residues have temperature factors of 31 to 33 A 2. The average isotropie temperature factor for the water molecules is 25'3 .h.2 and the maximum is 47.0A 2, but only six of the 87 molecules have temperature factors higher than 40 A 2.

parvalbumin. The close similarity between them is evident from Figure 9, which shows a superposition of the two backbones after a least-squares fit of the corresponding N, C~, C and 0 for residues 5 to 108 in the two structures. Residues 2 to 4 were excluded from the calculation because of the considerable

backbone displacement in that region. The 416 backbone atoms of residues 5 to 108 have a" rootmean-square (r.m.s.t) displacement of 0-62 A between the two structures, while the corresponding value for residues 2 to 4 is 1"90 A. Details of r.m.s. deviations for the various residues are presented in Figure 8(c). Maximum displacements between the atoms of the two backbones (ranging from 1"0 to 2-0 A) occur in the regions of residues 2 to 6, 59 to 61, 87, 90 and 108. A C= least-squares fit of residues 5 to 108 gives an r.m.s, displacement of 0"58 A and a maximum displacement of 2"23 A (at Gly60). The Ca ions of the CD and E F loops in the two structures are displaced by 0-26 A and 0"39 A, respectively. Two recent refinements of the structure of carp 4"25 parvalbumin (Swain et al., 1989; Kumar et al., 1990) have shown that each of the two Ca ions in the molecule is co-ordinated to seven oxygen atoms, as reported for the pike 4'10 parvalbumin (Declercq et al., 1988). This is also the case for several other calcium-binding regulatory proteins as summarized by Strynadka & James (1989), although a few sixco-ordinated Ca ions have been reported. According to the present study, each of the intramolecular Ca ions is co-ordinated to seven oxygen atoms including a water molecule. The residues contributing to the Ca co-ordination polyhedron of the E F loop are identical in both rat oncomodulin and carp parvalbumin. However, in the CD loop, Glu59 of carp parvalbumin is replaced in oncomodulin by t Abbreviation used: r.m.s., root-mean-square.

]Figure 10. The Ca co-ordination polyhedron and 0 " " 0 hydrogen bonding in the CD loop of rat oncomodulin, superimposed on the corresponding loop of carp parvalbumin (in orange). In oncomodulin, 0-112 and O-113 occupy approximately the same positions as OE1 and OE2 of Glu59 in parvalbumin.

Asp59, which occupies a position too far away for direct bonding to Ca-ll0. This change in the sidechain, together with some significant changes in the backbone atoms of residues 59 to 61, leaves sufficient space within the CD loop to accommodate two water molecules: WAT112, which binds directly to the calcium atom; W A T l l 3 , which forms three hydrogen bonds to W A T l l 2 (2"70A), Set55 OG (2"49A), and Asp59 OD2 (2"60 A), as shown in Figure 10. Thus, Asp59 in fact is separated by a chain of two water molecules from Ca-110, whereas the suggestion by Williams et al. (1987) was that oncomodulin's Asp59 binds metal only indirectly through one intervening water molecule, as found in the structure of turkey skeletal troponin-C (Herzberg & James, 1985). The latter proposal was considered to be consistent with the reduced affinity of the CD site for ions the size of Ca 2 + or smaller.

A projection of the CD and E F loops and their hydrogen bonding, approximately down the pseudo 2-fold axis between them, is presented in Figure 1 l, for both oncomodulin and parvalbumin. As shown in Table 2, the Ca-O bond lengths in oncomodulin are comparable to those of carp parvalbumin (Swain et al., 1989), with values in the range 2.20 to 2-51 A for the CD and EF polyhedra of oncomodulin, compared to 2-23 to 2.60 A in parvalbumin. The corresponding mean value is 2"38/~ for oncomodulin, compared to 2.42 A for parvalbumin. In oncomodulin's intermolecular polyhedron, the Ca-O bond lengths range from 2.07 to 2.64 A (mean 2-37 A). (b) Molecular aggregation The conclusion that the crystal structure of rat oncomodulin contains a third Ca ion per molecule

The corresponding loops of carp parvalbumin are shown in orange. was based on the convincing structural evidence described earlier, and on the fact that calcium was readily available in solution when the crystals were formed. This additional calcium site is intermolecular and results in extensive aggregation of the oncomodulin molecules into sheets normal to the b axis. According to the two recent structural refinements of carp parvalbumin (Swain et al., 1989; Kumar et al., 1990), only CD and EF calcium sites are present in the crystal structure. The absence of an intermolecular Ca 2+ site in carp parvalbumin could be attributed to the replacement of Gin54 and Gin71 in oncomodulin by two non-co-ordinating lysine side-chains. A report by Deelercq et al. (1989) on the crystal structure of pike 4-10 parvalbumin describes the presence of a third cation-binding site at 4"3 A from the Ca 2+ of the CD loop. The third cation, which is NH~ in that case but also can be Ca 2+, Mg2+ or Mn 2+, is surrounded by seven oxygen atoms. Three of these atoms are from water molecules and the others are Asp53 OD2, Glu59 OD1 and Asp61 OD1 and OD2, which belong to the CD loop of the same molecule. This site, which the authors view as a CD satellite site, does not form intermolecular linkages similar to those observed in rat oncomodulin. However, in the structural study of macromomycin at l ' 5 A resolution (Van Roey, 1989), an intermolecular Ca 2+ site was observed in the crystal structure. Its co-ordination polyhedron is also a pentagonal bipyramid made up of seven oxygen atoms from two water molecules and three different macromomycin molecules, similar to that found in oncomodulin. As is to be expected, the molecular aggregation in oncomodulin results in a tightly packed crystal structure. Thus, for oncomodulin the crystal's unit cell Volume is 84,158 A3, the molecular weight is 12,000, and for four molecules per unit cell the 3J volume/mass ratio is only 1"75/~,/Oa. The corresponding values for carp parvalbumin are V = 93,051 A3, M r = 11,500, and ratio V/4Mr 2.02 ha/Da. (c) Intramolecular contacts The intramoleeular contacts t h a t involve polar side-chains with hydrogen bond donor-aeeeptor distances less than 3"25 A are listed in Table 4A and

short interactions between main-chain atoms that are separated by five or more residues. These include the two N - H ' - " 0 hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms of residues 58 and 97 (Fig. 11), whose function is to stabilize the relative orientations of the CD and EF loops. (d) Solvent structure At the present stage of structure refinement, the solvent structure in the asymmetric part of the unit cell includes the intermolecular Ca-135 ion and 87 water molecules, four of which are bonded directly to Ca ions. Thus, WAT111 occupies one apex of the polyhedron in the EF loop and links it through a hydrogen bond to Asp94 OD2, with 0 " " O distance of 2"66 A. W A T l l 2 is also located at one apex of the polyhedron in the CD loop, and links it indirectly to Asp59 OD2 through two hydrogen bonds W A T l 1 2 - . . W A T 1 1 3 (2"70A) and WAT113"-Asp59 OD2 (2-60 A). In addition, WAT113 forms a third hydrogen bond of 2.49 A to Ser55 OG. The two molecules WAT169 and WAT172 serve as vertices in the intermolecular Ca-135 polyhedron, linking it directly to an adjacent molecule through the two hydrogen bonds W A T 1 6 9 " - A s p 9 2 0 {2.69 A) and WAT172... Asp92 O (2-72 A). The remaining water molecules are involved in a large number of hydrogen bonds as summarized in Table 5A and B. The only water molecule that lies somewhat inside the protein surface is WAT119, which forms two hydrogen bonds to Lys64 0 and Arg75 0 at 0"-" 0 distances of 2"91 and 2"58 A, respectively; it is well defined in the electron density map, has a relatively low temperature factor of 7"1 A2 and serves t o bridge two stretches of the backbone separated by 11 residues.

B. The residues with the greatest number of interactions are 51 to 57, 75 to 81 and 90 to 101, while those with the least number are the terminal residues 2 to 17 and 102 to 108, a pattern that is also reflected in the mean B values of the backbone atoms shown in Figure 8(a). Table 4C contains the

A. Main-chain to side-chain interactions

(e) Aromatic rings
Rat oncomodulin contains 11 aromatic rings comprising one His, two Tyr, and eight Phe groups. Of those, Phe47, Phe49, Tyr57, Tyr65, and His67 lie on the outside surface of the protein, while the six remaining Phe groups (residue numbers 24, 29, 30, 66, 70 and 102) form the hydrophobic core inside the molecule and are conserved also in carp parvalbumin. The positions and orientations of the Phe rings in the core region are only slightly different in the two structures. The centroids of the nearest rings in the core of oneomodulin are 5-1 A between Phe29 and Phe70, 5"5 A between Phe24 and Phe29, and 5"5 A between Phe66 and PheT0, compared to a minimum of 5"5 A in ealmodulin (Babu et al., 1988). (f) Dimerization via disulfide linkage Evidence presented (Mutus et al., 1988; Clayshulte et al., 1990) showed that oncomodulin can dimerize by forming a disulfide bridge through the Cysl8 thiol, which is the sole Cys residue in the molecule. In the crystal structures, the Cysl8 thiol is found to be in the same position and orientation

in oncomodulin as in carp parvalbumin, even when residue 18 was excluded from the calculation of phases to eliminate any bias in the resulting electron density maps. In both cases Cysl8 lies near the molecular surface, which is furthest from the CD and EF metal binding domains, and has the C-S bond pointing towards the inside of the molecule.

With the Cysl8 SG in that relatively inaccessible position, dimerization through a disulfide bond formation would not be possible without a substantial conformational change. In oncomodulin, the thiol is at distances 3-40 A from Alal4 O, and 3"48 A from WAT149. The latter is close to the molecular surface, and lies at a distance of 3"13A from WAT170, which is on the outside of the molecule. This shows the existence of a narrow channel leading from the thiol to the outside of the molecule, but that still leaves the thiol inaccessible for facile dimerization.

Although there is close similarity in the backbones of rat oncomodulin and carp parvalbumin, the main structural difference between the two molecules appears to stem from the changes in the side-chains. Parvalbumin contains 48 Lys, Ala, Val and Phe residues which are not suitable for coordination to calcium, compared to only 26 in oncomodulin. Conversely, oncomodulin has 44 Asp, Gtu, Gln and Ser side-chains, which are capable of forming Ca-O bonds, compared to 27 in parvalbumin. An interesting result of the larger number of potential calcium-binding oxygen atoms in oncomodulin is the extensive molecular aggregation via Ca 2+ in the crystal structure. No such aggregation has been observed in the parvalbumin structure, or in any of the other known structures of the troponin-C family of calcium-binding regulatory proteins. The distribution of ionic groups in oneomodulin favours different ionic interactions for both proteins; this was recently substantiated by Cox et al. (1990). Despite the similarities between the threedimensional structures of parvalbumin and oncomodulin, the unique properties of oncomodulin such as the presence of a calcium-specific binding site, or enzyme stimulation and inhibition, remain unexplained. It is intriguing that the two proteins are so alike yet so different functionally. A detailed examination of the structural and functional differences between oncomodulin and parvalbumin is in progress and the results will be described in a future publication. We thank Dr B. F. P. Edwards for providing us with the refined atomic co-ordinates for carp parvalbumin in advance of publication. We also thank Katherine Crumley for supervising the data collection on the multiwire area detector at the University of North Carolina, and Dr C. Carter for permission to use the system. The assistance of Dr A.R. Sielecki and Dr M. Cygler with the molecular replacement software is gratefully acknowledged. The least-squares fit of the parvalbumin and oncomodulin main-chains was computed by Dr R. L. Campbell of this laboratory, to whom we are grateful. This is N.R.C. publication no. 31888.
