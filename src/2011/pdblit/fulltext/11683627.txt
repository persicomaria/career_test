ABSTRACT: Exendin-4, a 39 amino acid peptide originally isolated from the oral secretions of the lizard Heloderma suspectum, has been shown to share certain activities with glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), a 30 amino acid peptide. We have determined the structuring preferences of exendin-4 and GLP-1 by NMR in both the solution and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelle-associated states. Based on both chemical shift deviations and the pattern of intermediate range NOEs, both peptides display significant helicity from residue 7 to residue 28 with greater fraying at the N-terminus. Thornton and Gorenstein [(1994) Biochemistry 33, 3532-3539] reported that the presence of a flexible, helix-destabilizing, glycine at residue 16 in GLP-1 was an important feature for membrane and receptor binding. Exendin-4 has a helix-favoring glutamate as residue 16. In the micelle-associated state, NMR data indicate that GLP-1 is less helical than exendin-4 due to the presence of Gly16; chemical shift deviations along the peptide sequence suggest that Gly16 serves as an N-cap for a second, more persistent, helix. In 30 vol-% trifluoroethanol (TFE), a single continuous helix is evident in a significant fraction of the GLP-1 conformers present. Exendin-4 has a more regular and less fluxional helix in both media and displays stable tertiary structure in the solution state. In the micelle-bound state of exendin-4, a single helix (residues 11-27) is observed with residues 31-39 completely disordered and undergoing rapid segmental motion. In aqueous fluoroalcohol or aqueous glycol, the Leu21-Pro38 span of exendin-4 forms a compact tertiary fold (the Trp-cage) which shields the side chain of Trp25 from solvent exposure and produces ring current shifts as large as 3 ppm. This tertiary structure is partially populated in water and fully populated in aqueous TFE. The Leu21-Pro38 segment of exendin-4 may be the smallest protein-like folding unit observed to date. When the Trp-cage forms, fraying of the exendin-4 helix occurs exclusively from the N-terminus; backbone NHs for the C-terminal residues of the helix display H/D exchange protection factors as large as 105 at 9 °C. In contrast, no tertiary structure is evident when exendin-4 binds to DPC micelles. An energetically favorable insertion of the tryptophan ring into the DPC micelle is suggested as the basis for this change. With the exception of exendin-4 in media containing fluoro alcohol cosolvents, NMR structure ensembles generated from the NOE data do not fully reflect the conformational averaging present in these systems. Secondary structure definition from chemical shift deviations may be the most appropriate treatment for peptides that lack tertiary structure.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by multiple metabolic abnormalities arising primarily from an inadequate insulin effect. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1),1 a 30 amino acid mammalian hormone, has been investigated as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of this disease because of its favorable spectrum of antidiabetic actions including a glucose-dependent insulinotropic action (1, 2), modulation of gastric emptying (3, 4), and a possible role in appetite control (5). Due to its short duration of action, GLP-1 may have limitations as a therapeutic agent.

Exendin-4 (6) is a 39 amino acid peptide that exhibits several of the antidiabetic actions of the mammalian hormone GLP-1. Exendin-4 displays approximately 50% sequence identity to GLP-1 and binds to and acts as an agonist at the GLP-1 receptor on RINm5f cell membranes (7). It has been

NMR Structural Comparison of Exendin and GLP-1 shown to have activities known to be important for improvement of glucose control and to be markedly more potent or long-lived in vivo than GLP-1 for these activities (8). In animal models, exendin-4 has been shown to stimulate secretion of insulin in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations, but not during hypoglycemic periods. Synthetic exendin-4 (AC2993) is currently in Phase 2 evaluation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. To better understand GLP-1 and exendin-4, we have compared them by circular dichroism (CD) and NMR in both the solution and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelleassociated states. The CD studies are reported elsewhere (9). To our knowledge, there are only three previous structural studies related to GLP-1 and exendin-4. One study, using FT-IR and near-IR FT-Raman spectroscopies (10), investigated the effect of media and sample preparation on the peptide conformation and the resulting tendency of insulintropin to aggregate. Insulintropin differs from GLP-1 only at the C-terminus where Gly31 replaces the C-terminal amide. In the second study, GLP-1 was examined by NMR in aqueous media containing dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles (11). That study suggested that GLP-1 is helical from residue 7 to residue 29 with a distortion in backbone geometry at residues 15-17. Thornton and Gorenstein suggested that the flexible link about Gly16 allows all of the aromatic residues to line up on one face of the helix facilitating membrane association. They further suggested that displaying these hydrophobic residues on a single face could be important for receptor binding affinity. Glucagon, which otherwise displays significant homology to GLP-1, lacks the flexible linker induced by Gly16 and displays greatly diminished binding to GLP-1 receptors (12). The sequences of the peptides are shown below:

Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 44, 2001 13189 (average error in residue count ×e16.1 ( 5.9% for Glx, Asx, and all residues other than Trp; 1.7% for Asx/Glx/ Pro/Gly/Met/Leu/Lys/His) and HPLC (>98% on Vydac C18). The average molecular weights observed by MS were within 0.6 amu of the expectation based on the sequence. The sequences were confirmed by the NMR studies reported herein. NMR Experiments. Solution-state protic NMR samples (ca. 500 µL) were made by dissolving 1-4 mg of lyophilized peptide in 15 mM phosphate or phosphate/acetate buffer (pH 3.5 or 5.9) and immediately adding cosolvents as needed to the stated final compositions (vol-%, simply indicated as `%' from here forward): 30% d3-TFE, 60% d3-TFE, 36% d2HFIP (hexafluoro-2-propanol), 8.5% d2-HFIP with 18.4% d61,2-ethanediol (glycol), and 30% d6-glycol. The micelle samples were prepared by mixing a solution of the peptide with a micelle-containing solution to give the desired peptide concentration and ratio of peptide to micelle. Sodium 2,2dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) was used to calibrate the chemical shifts in all samples. NOESY and TOCSY spectra were collected for all media, typically at several temperatures to resolve partially overlapping peaks with different temperature gradients. The D2O-exchanged sample of exendin-4 was prepared by repeated addition of 99.96% D2O and lyophilization (3 times over 3 days) starting with an initial 700 µM peptide solution in 15 mM phosphatebuffered D2O containing 15% TFE adjusted to pH* 5.35. TOCSY spectra employed the clean MLEV-17 spin-lock (14) with mixing periods of 10-55 ms. Solvent suppression was accomplished using the WATERGATE (15) pulse sequence. With the exception of the NH exchange studies, all the spectra were collected on a Bruker DMX operating at 750 MHz. NOESY spectra were also collected for the fully deuterium-exchanged state in each medium. Anti/gauche R/  assignments and HN/RR coupling constants were confirmed by short mixing time (10-15 ms) TOCSY spectra. The NH exchange studies were acquired on a Bruker DRX spectrometer operating at 499.8 MHz. 1D spectra were collected over a period of 15 days at 297 ( 2 °C for both pD 3.5 and pD 5.9 solutions to estimate exchange half-lives. An NOESY spectrum of the pD 3.5 sample was collected 4 h after exchange was initiated to verify assignments of the 1D spectra for all slow-exchanging amide protons. More precise exchange rates were obtained at 7 °C (for the first 16 h, then at 9 °C for the remaining days) using 3:7 volume mixtures of pH* 6.03 and 7.20 aqueous D2O buffer (25 mM phosphate) and TFE (corresponding to pD 6.0 and 6.6 due to the leveling effect of the added TFE). At pD 6.6, the exchange rates for the Ile23-Lys27 segment ranged from 0.009 to 0.173 days-1. The reference exchange rates employed for protection factor calculations for the Trp side chain and a backbone Ala-Ala unit at 7 °C were, respectively, at pD 6.0, 1.00 and 2.69 min-1, and at pD 6.6, 2.94 and 10.72 min-1, based on the closest literature analogies for strictly aqueous media (16, 17). A precise conversion of the measured exchange rates to protection factors is problematic due to the undefined effects of TFE upon intrinsic exchange rates and Molday factors. For backbone NHs, we have assumed a 20% reduction in the intrinsic rate and that the Molday factors that are known for low-salt aqueous conditions (16) apply. Buck et al. (18) have reported that TFE addition at levels up to 50% changes

The central LEGQ segment of GLP-1, which contains the flexible glycine, is replaced by MEEE in the corresponding sequence of exendin-4. Thus, the ability of both GLP-1 and exendin-4 to bind and promote agonist activity at the GLP-1 receptor in vitro suggests that the hypothesized importance of the structuring effects of Gly16 in GLP-1 for receptor activation needs to be reexamined. In the third literature study, Parker et al. (13) examined a series of GLP-1 mutants, an exendin-4/GLP-1 chimera, and several cross-linked GLP-1 mutants by NMR in 50 vol-% aqueous TFE and concluded that most of the species examined display two helices (Asp9Glu15, Ala19-Val27) in this highly helix-favoring medium. In 50% TFE, the more converged helical span was from Ala19 to Val27. This C-terminal helix was viewed as an essential feature of the bioactive conformation of GLP-1 serving to orient key residues such as Phe22, Ile23, and Trp25 as required for interaction with the receptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS Peptide Samples. Exendin-4 and GLP-1 were prepared by standard solid-phase peptide synthesis protocols (Amylin lots #CS171297 and #P180597, respectively). Amino acid compositions and purity were confirmed by amino acid analyses

13190 Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 44, 2001 the intrinsic backbone NH exchange rates by less than a factor of 3. Our reported backbone NH exchange protection factors could be as much as 2-3 times the actual values. Control exchange studies (present work) for a Trp-containing tripeptide suggest that no TFE correction is required for the intrinsic exchange rate of the indole ring NH. The acidifying effect of TFE was taken in account in the calculations. At pH g5.5, it can safely be assumed that backbone NH exchange rates should increase 10-fold with a 1 unit increase in log[DO-]. As a result, the leveling effect (and possible changes in the glass electrode response) could be calibrated from a semilog plot of pH meter reading versus kobs over the pH meter reading range 5-8. NMR Structure Ensemble Generation. NOESY data from all available experimental conditions were converted to distance constraints. Distance constraint tables of varying precision were developed from the NOE data; more precise constraint tables allowed for improved assignment error checking, while the less precise, "conservative" constraints reduce the possibility of data over-interpretation. The observed NOE intensities, recorded as the number of contour levels (ncl), were corrected for relative peak width in the directly detected dimension and for the H/D ratio for peaks involving NHs. These adjusted peak contour levels were converted to distances using the relation: dexp ) dref,[1.41(1/6)](nclref-nclexp), reflecting the contour multiplier of 1.41 which was used for plotting the spectra. The reference distances for specific classes of NOEs were the following: smallest RiNi+1 ) 3.3-3.8, largest RiNi+1 ) 2.0-2.4, largest NiNi+1 in a helical span ) 2.35-2.9, and RiNi ) 2.8 Å. As a result, relatively tight distance constraints, rij ) (dij d-) f (dij + d+), were derived. For exendin-4, as an example, the average low and high distance bounds over all constraints with an upper bound in the range 3.3-3.9 Å were 2.81 and 3.63 Å (n ) 89), considerably more restrictive than the `medium' or `small' category of a standard four-group NOE classification: L (large), M (medium, typically 2.0-3.5 Å), S (small), and VS (very small). Distance bounds for methyl and shift-coincident methylene groups derived from NOEs were increased by a factor of 1.2 and 1.04, respectively. These constraints were used in both XPLOR3.1 (19) and CNS0.9 (20) simulating annealing scripts. Further details of the XPLOR procedures, which included H-bond constraints and low-bound-only constraints, also known as ADCs (21), and of CNS runs using constraints of comparable and lesser precision appear in the Supporting Information. The exendin-4 ensemble appearing in Figures 5-7 was generated using a conservative CNS protocol with a universal 2.0 Å low-bound and four upper-bound categories [L (3.0), M (3.5), S (4.0), and VS (5.0 Å)]; for constraints involving methyl groups, the upper bounds for the four categories were extended to 3.15, 3.8, 4.6, and 6.0 Å. Similar upper limits have been used for both proteins and peptides; e.g., structures of a series of constrained GLP-1 analogues employed 3, 4, and 5 Å upper limits (13). The Supporting Information contains a complete listing of the distance constraints used to derive solution-state structure ensembles for exendin-4 with varying levels of constraint precision. The coordinates and NMR restraints for the "conservative" structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 1jrj.

Neidigh et al. Stereospecific assignments were obtained for some of the CR and C methylenes. For the C methylenes, the anti/ gauche assignments were converted into alternative distance constraints (dRi i ) 2.85-3.20 and 2.30-2.75 Å, respectively, which were used in lieu of torsion constraints) when confirmed by R /R  NOE ratios observed in the short mixing time NOESY; in the most conservative CNS protocol, these were viewed as M and S category NOEs, respectively. The two alternative assignments were examined for these and all iNi+1/ iNi/ iRi-3 constraints. If one assignment produced lower ENOE values for a large majority of the structures in the ensemble, that stereospecific assignment version was used in the final ensemble generation. A similar procedure was used for Gly-RR, Val-, Ile-11, and Leu assignments. The default CNS simulated annealing script, which includes high-temperature dynamics and then a cooling cycle in torsion space (with kNOE ) 150) followed by further cooling in Cartesian space (kNOE ) 50) and minimization (kNOE ) 75), was modified in the following ways: (a) the high-temperature torsion dynamics and cooling phases were each doubled in length (2000 15-fs steps each, initially at 50 000 K with cooling during the last 2000 steps); (b) the Cartesian cooling cycle (starting at 2000 K, kNOE ) 75 or 50 kcal/Å2) was also doubled in length (6000 5-fs steps) which allowed us to ramp the Erepel scale factor from 0.2 to 1.0 during the cycle; (c) chemical shift and H-bond constraints were not employed, and the dihedral angle energy function was disabled; (d) the Erepel function was replaced by a Lennard-Jones potential during the final Powell minimizations10 cycles of 100 steps each during which kNOE is set at 75 (when loose, conservative constraints are employed) or 40 (for more precise constraints) kcal/Å2. We have found that these changes greatly improve both the convergence and success rate of CNS annealing for exendin4, and also for a helical peptide and a small single-domain protein. In the present study, 50 random structures were used, producing 36 accepted structures with no NOE distance restraint violations in excess of 0.2 Å. The other acceptance criteria were based on agreement with idealized covalent geometry (no single bond length, angle, or improper torsion rmsd exceeding 0.02 Å, 3°, and 2°, respectively, in the structure; in addition, the mean bond length, angle, and improper torsion rmsd had to be <0.01 Å, 0.5°, and 0.3°, respectively, for acceptance). EValuation of ConVergence and Structural DeViations in NMR Ensembles. The structure (bond, angle, and improper torsion rmsd versus standard values) and violation statistics [fraction of constraints violated by >0.1 Å and rmsd ((se) from the distance constraints] are over the complete ensemble. Backbone and heavy atom rmsd measures of convergence are, unless otherwise noted, the mean ( se for pairwise comparisons over the entire accepted ensemble rather than rmsd versus the mean structure. The rmsd calculations and figures depicting structure ensembles were generated using MolMol (22). RESULTS Essentially complete chemical shift assignments and NOE intensity measurements were obtained for exendin-4 in six media: (1) aqueous DPC micelles; (2) 30% ethane-1,2-diol

NMR Structural Comparison of Exendin and GLP-1 (glycol) in water at 320 K; (3) aqueous buffer with added glycol (18%) and hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP, 8%) at 314 K; (4) 30% aqueous TFE; (5) aqueous 36% HFIP; and (6) aqueous 60% TFE. Chemical shift comparisons for GLP-1 in the DPC micelle-associated state were taken from the literature (11). Since Parker et al. (13) did not report the GLP-1 chemical shift data for their study in 50% TFE, we collected NMR data for GLP-1 in 30% TFE for comparison with the exendin-4 data. Preliminary CD comparisons (9) indicated that GLP-1 forms helix bundles (and within days larger aggregates) at NMR concentrations in the absence of added lipid micelles or fluoroalcohol. This precludes a meaningful NMR examination of GLP-1 in aqueous buffer. Under all of the conditions used in the present NMR investigations, CD spectra are identical at 20 µM and 1.2 mM, and the spectra are not time-dependent. For exendin-4 under conditions (2) and (3), line broadening at low temperatures suggests a modest level of aggregation; therefore, the data were collected at higher temperatures, and structures were not derived from the NOESY data. For the other media, line widths and relaxation rates at 280-320 K were consistent with expectations for a monomeric system of this molecular weight. Resonance assignments were made by the usual TOCSY/ NOESY strategy (23). Since there are residue differences between exendin-4 and GLP-1, all shift comparisons are expressed as chemical shift deviations (CSDs). The coil reference values have been previously reported along with the corrections for nearest neighbor, end, medium composition, and, in the case of NH's, temperature effects (24). Structure ensembles were generated using both conservative (loose bounds) and aggressive (more precise distance constraints) interpretations of the NOEs. In retrospect, only for exendin-4 in solutions containing some added fluoro alcohol, was the constraint density sufficient for the derivation of a high-resolution structure. Changes in structuring preferences with medium and the contrasts between GLP-1 and exendin-4 are based on CSD histograms and qualitative NOE comparisons. NMR ensembles for GLP-1 in aqueous TFE and exendin-4 in aqueous DPC micelles are presented in the Supporting Information. Structuring Preferences of GLP-1 in Aqueous TFE and in the DPC Micelle-Associated State. The complete resonance assignment for GLP-1 in 30% TFE appears in Table 1S. NOESY spectra acquired for the solution state in 30% TFE/70% pH 5.9 aqueous buffer at 285 K (m ) 160 and 60 ms) and 300 K (m ) 60 ms) provided 119 structurally significant NOE distance constraints: 16 intraresidue and 104 short- to medium-range interresidue (i/i(n, n ) 4). NiNi+1 NOEs and a nearly continuous set of i/i+3 NOE connectivities (RN and/or R ) were observed from Leu7 through Ala24. This suggests significant helicity over this span. However, a more quantitative NOE indicator of helicity, RiNi+1 to RiNi NOE ratios (25), provides further insight. For well-populated helices, RiNi+1 NOE intensities should be equal to or less intense than RiNi+3 NOEs for both R and 310 helices. Local unfolding or end-fraying increases the intensity of the RiNi+1 NOEs dramatically. The RiNi+1 NOEs of GLP-1 are significantly smaller than the RiNi NOEs only for residues 10-14 and 19-24. Also, the intensities of i/i+3 and i/i+4 NOEs that spanned and immediately followed Gly16 were reduced. Significant sampling of more

FIGURE 1: Chemical shift deviations for GLP-1 in aqueous 30% TFE and the micelle-associated state. Panels A and B show the HR and NH CSD histograms, respectively. The NH random coil values were corrected to the experimental temperature using a slope of -7.6 ppb/°C for both the micelle-bound and aqueous 30% TFE states. In panel A, the positions of Thr7, Gly16, and Leu26 are labeled.

extended conformations must be occurring for GLP-1 under these conditions; this is not fully reflected in the NMR structure ensemble (see Supporting Information). The conflict between medium-range and vicinal residue NOE constraints is more notable when relatively tight distance constraints are employed: the i/i+1 constraints will have less influence on the structure when wider, conservative, bounds are employed. Precise (tight) constraints yield relatively large (g20 kcal/ mol) E  values when conformational averaging is occurring producing either alternative conformer clusters or false convergence. The application of conservative (loose) bounds in peptide structure ensemble calculations is likely to emphasize the conformers with intermediate-range order; this is also a case of false convergence. CSD histograms provide a semiquantitative basis for assessing differences in secondary structure along a peptide sequence. The interpretation of HR CSDs is well established; significantly positive values indicate a strand preference, and -0.39 ppm (26) is viewed as the value that represents 100% helicity. The interpretation of NH shift deviations is more controversial. It is essential to include the random coil temperature gradient of NH shifts in the calculation (24, 27). The HN and HR chemical shift deviation plots for GLP-1 in the micelle-associated and aqueous TFE solution states appear in Figure 1; the micelle values are derived from the shifts reported by Thornton and Gorenstein (11). The HR CSD plot (panel A) indicates helicity from residues 7 to 30 for GLP-1 in both solvents. Both ends of this `helix' are frayed, and the residues about Gly16 sample / conformation space outside the helical region. The only positive CSD

is for Gly16 in the aqueous DPC micelle medium, and this residue displays a greatly diminished upfield shift in 30% TFE. In the DPC micelle data set, residues 14 and 15 also display greatly diminished upfield shifts. This is consistent with a more pronounced helix-interrupting, N-capping role for Gly16 in the micelle-bound state. Amide NH CSDs can also provide evidence for the medium-induced structural distinctions. It has been established that the helix macrodipole causes large positiondependent changes in HN chemical shifts (28). On this basis, the increasingly upfield HN shifts at residues 12-15 in the micelle data indicate the C-terminal end of a helix macrodipole (Figure 1B). After Gly16, downfield HN shifts are again observed reflecting the positive N-terminus of a new helix. The HN shift data for 30% aqueous TFE do not display the anticipated effects of two helix macrodipoles. Apparently, the helix propagates through Gly16 in most of the conformers present in 30% TFE. Four NHs (Leu14,26, Ile23, and Val27) are notably downfield in aqueous TFE; this probably reflects particularly strong hydrogen bonding on the hydrophobic face of the helix (26). Structure of Exendin-4 in the DPC Micelle-Bound State. To compare the micelle-bound state of exendin-4 with that reported for GLP-1 (11), micellular solutions of ca. 200 mM aqueous DPC were used to solubilize exendin-4 (1.5 mM) at both pH 3.5 and pH 5.9. To minimize the line widths and obtain easily assignable 2D spectra, the definitive NMR data were collected using the pH 5.9 buffer at 314 K. The chemical shift assignments for exendin-4 in the DPC micelleassociated state appear in Table 2S. The HR CSDs of exendin-4 and GLP-1 in the micelle-associated state are compared in Figure 2. The data for exendin-4 support a helical conformation for the residue 7-27 span with significant fraying in the N-terminal turn. The HR CSD histogram indicates that both extreme termini are fully disordered (see Figure 3B, vide infra, for the CSDs at residue 30-39). Qualitative analysis of NOEs also supports this view. For example, the flexibility of the C-terminus is fully confirmed by NOESY/TOCSY peak intensity comparisons: interresidue NOESY peaks are present but of diminished intensity for residues 31-33 and absent any further toward the C-terminus. The C-terminal residues were assigned only from the sharp and intense TOCSY peaks. The lack of NOEs

(B) HR CSD comparison for residues 21-39 of the exendin-4 in aqueous DPC micelles, 30% glycol, and 30% TFE; two entries appear for Gly30. A small decrease in helicity upon addition of 30% TFE is suggested by the decreased upfield shifts at the R methines of Leu21-Trp25. This is also observed for the remainder of the helical span; for residues 7-20, the average CSD change is +0.07 ( 0.08 ppm upfield for transport from the micelle-bound state to 30% TFE medium. This effect is not observed for GLP-1 (see Figure 1A).

indicates that segmental motion reduces the effective correlation time to the point where NOEs cross over from large molecule cross-saturation to the `positive' NOEs seen in small molecules. A similar analysis suggests that the side chains are fully disordered for residues 1, 3, and 31-39. A more quantitative NOE analysis (based on the intensities in a 160 ms mixing time NOESY experiment at pH 3.5 and 300 K which provided 167 structurally significant NOE distance constraintss14 intraresidue, 149 short- to mediumrange interresidue, and 4 longer range connectivities) provides a somewhat contrasting view. Given the low NOE density (ca. 5 constraints/residue over the `structured' 7-31 residue span), the accuracy and usefulness of the resulting structure ensemble (Supporting Information) must be questioned. In this ensemble, the helix is limited to residues 1127. This likely reflects the short, conformationally averaged RiNi+1 distances that result from unfolded state contributions in the N-terminal portion of the helix.

NMR Structural Comparison of Exendin and GLP-1 DeriVing a Solution-State Structure for Exendin-4. Solutions of exendin-4 in media lacking lipid micelles were thoroughly examined by NMR. The solubility of exendin-4 was sufficient even in aqueous buffers lacking cosolvents; however, most signals were too broad for clear definition in 1D spectra at 285 K (pH 5.9 buffer) presumably due to slow exchange between conformational states or with an aggregated state. Increasing the temperature to 300 K provided additional signals and also improved the intensity and line widths for all the observed resonances. But some of the Trp25 aromatic hydrogen signals, for example, were not observable. Further warming and the addition of glycol to 30 vol-% afforded TOCSY and NOESY spectra that provided a complete assignment. Aqueous fluoro alcohol media (36% HFIP, 30% and 60% TFE, and 8% HFIP/18% glycol) were also examined. The NOE contacts observed (Figure 3A, for 30% TFE) imply a helix spanning from residue 7 (or 8) to residue 28; the HR chemical shift deviations afford the same conclusion for this medium and for aqueous 30% glycol. Some very large HR CSDs are observed in the solution state (30% aqueous glycol or 30% TFE) that are not observed in the micelle-associated state (Figure 3B). Resonances other than those of R methines also displayed unusual shifts; some diagnostic structuring shifts (as CSDs) for proline resonances illustrate this. The CSDs are listed in the order: micellestate, 30% glycol (at 320 K), 30% TFE (at 300 K): Pro313 (-0.29, -0.87, -0.76), Pro37- 3 (+0.03, -0.56, -1.35), Pro37- 2 (0.00, -0.26, -0.56), Pro37-3 (-0.06, -0.16, -0.46), and Pro38-3 (0.00, -0.26, -0.58 ppm). In aqueous glycol at 320 K, the `structuring shifts' for all shifted proton resonances of Pro37,38 are 47 ( 12% of those observed in aqueous TFE at 300 K. The chemical shift assignments for exendin-4 in 30% TFE at 300 K appear in Table 3S. The chemical shifts for the solution-state conformation(s) represent very large differences from the random coil values, particularly in the Trp25-Pro37 span. This suggested tertiary structuring at the C-terminus in the solution state. The two most diagnostic NMR characteristics of protein tertiary structure, chemical shift dispersion and the protection of backbone NHs from H/D exchange by persistent H-bonds and/or reduced exposure to the bulk medium, are both observed for exendin-4 in the solution state. Figure 4 shows two panels of a NOESY recorded after extensive attempts (2+ days, pD > 5.6) to exchange deuterium into the peptide. Figure 4 also serves to illustrate the existence of an extensive web of medium- and long-range NOE connectivities in the Phe22-Pro38 span; for example, the tryptophan ring hydrogens have large- or medium-sized NOE connectivities to the R-protons of Pro31,36,37, and the protons of Phe22 have connectivities with the Pro37,38 unit. The average constraint density over the Leu21-Pro38 segment was 11 distances/residue (the simulated annealing runs included 46 long-range constraints, i/i(n with n > 4, which were all within this span); as a result, it was possible to obtain a wellconverged structure ensemble based on the NOE constraints. NMR structure ensembles were derived from NOESY distance constraints using a variety of protocols (see Supporting Information). The NOE intensities were taken largely from 750 MHz spectra recorded at 280-300 K for pH 5.9 buffer containing 30% TFE with mixing times between 60 and 200 ms. Ambiguities resulting from chemical shift overlaps were resolved by references to additional NOESY

Here we present the results of the most conservative structure derivation; a nearly default CNS script (20) was employed with a universal low-bound of 2.0 Å. No torsion constraints were employed. In addition, even though we observed numerous exchange-protected NHs (vide infra), H-bond constraints were not employed. This was done to ensure that the structures generated were required by the NOEs observed and not the results of assumed H-bonding norms for secondary structure motifs. Statistics from the structure elucidation protocol appear in Table 1. The accepted ensemble (36 structures from 50 random starts) appears in Figures 5 and 6; the primary acceptance criterion was no restraint violations greater than 0.2 Å. The pairwise backbone rmsd over residues 2-38 was 2.35 ( 0.76 Å; the poor fit was due largely to the significant disorder at the N-terminus (backbone rmsd 2.31 ( 0.72 Å over residues 2-10, versus 0.63 ( 0.22 Å for residues 11-38). The dihedral angle distribution within the ensemble appears in the Supporting Information (Table 4S). The convergence over the helical span is illustrated in Figure 5. Figure 5 also shows the essentially complete disorder in the first six residues of the peptide. The structure is best described as a helix spanning Thr7-Asn28 with some fraying in the two Nterminal turns (pairwise backbone rmsd ) 0.54 Å for residues 7-19 versus 0.21 Å for residues 16-28). The unusual phi value (135 ( 10°) for Gly29 signals the C-capping residue. A specific capping interaction is not evident at the Nterminus of this helix; however, NOEs between the Phe6 and Leu10 side chains suggest some local hydrophobic clustering. A shorter 310 helical segment appears at Pro31-Ser33. The convergence over the portion of the structure that displays tertiary structure (residues 21-38) was even tighter (0.76 Å rmsd for all heavy atoms). Figure 6 shows the structure of this fold; we designate the C-terminal structure of exendin-4 as the `Trp-cage fold'. In the Trp-cage fold, the Pro36,37,38 unit adopts a poly-ProII conformation and docks onto the aromatic rings of Phe22 and Trp25. The helical portion of the motif (residues 21-28) is the C-terminal extension of the R helix previously observed in the micelleassociated state but ends with an i-3 H-bond (Gly29-NH f OdC-Leu26). In an ensemble generated with high precision constraints (see Supporting Information), the Trp25-NH is situated equally well for H-bonding to the carbonyls of Leu21 and Phe22. This ensemble also has (in all structures) Ser32NH f OdC-Gly29 and Ser33-NH f OdC-Gly30 H-bonds reflecting a short 310 helix; these are present in 35% of the structures in the most conservatively derived ensemble which is shown in Figure 6, panel A. A Trp25-N 1H f OdC-Ala35 H-bond is present in all structures of all ensembles and imparts significant exchange protection. Two additional H-bonds that appear in the NMR structure ensembles deserve note: Gly30-NH f OdC-Trp25, Ser33-OH f OdC-Asn28 (or Ser33-OH f OdC-Gly30 in some members of the ensemble). The former produces a modest level of NH protection, and there is experimental evidence to support the latter in some analogues. In two truncated mutants of the exendin-4 C-terminus, the Ser33-OH appears in the spectrum and displays both intra- and interresidue NOEs (29). This suggests a degree of protection that is very unusual for an hydroxyl group in a peptide.

FIGURE 4: NOESY spectra (with a mixing time of 150 ms) of exendin-4 in 30% TFE (deuterated media), pH* 5.9, at 300 K. The sample was allowed to exchange in several serial batches of D2O buffer (pH* adjusted to 5.35 for each batch) over a period of 3 days with lyophilization to dryness after each exchange. The final buffer was 99.95% deuterated. Panel A illustrates helical Ri/ i+3 connectivities and the assignments of Gly30 and the proline resonances. In panel B, NOESY connectivities that establish that the residual NHs are in a helical span and aryl-H/CH NOEs reflecting tertiary structure are labeled and color-coded by residue. R20-HR and E24-HR are shift-coincident (4.014 ppm), while F22-HR (4.292 ppm) and W25-HR (4.281 ppm) are nearly coincident. A weak 22HR/23HN NOESY peak appears when the spectrum is plotted with a lower contour level cutoff. The Trp aryl-H lines are labeled using indole ring numbering (2-7). The upfield peak (**) on the 22 line is due to Pro38-2.

While the numerous H-bonds undoubtedly provide some fold stabilization, the primary feature of the Trp-cage is an extensive hydrophobic cluster. The close packing of the cluster is evident upon inspection of a space-filling model of the fold (panel B, Figure 6). The Leu26 side chain is fully ordered with the downfield methyl, C1H3, interacting exclusively with an edge of the phenyl ring. The 2 methyl contacts with both aryl rings and the Pro31-C methylene (confirmed by NOEs). These interactions, Leu21, Val19, and backbone atoms, encase all but one surface of the phenyl

ring. The (CH2)3 unit of Pro31, Leu26-CH, the methylene of Gly30, and Ala35 provide coverage of the periphery and the bottom surface of the indole ring. The association of two additional prolines completes the aryl ring cage: Pro37 is positioned immediately above the indole ring with the two ring planes nearly parallel, and the Pro38 -CH2 fills the gap between the phenyl and indole ring. The remainder of the Pro38 ring provides additional coverage of the phenyl ring and possibly the Leu21 side chain. The close proximity and specific spatial relationships of numerous protons to the two

Amide NH Exchange Studies on Exendin-4 in Aqueous TFE. To probe the stability of the tertiary and secondary structural features of the NMR ensemble, NH exchange rates were measured. The key observations are given here: (a) at laboratory temperatures, residues 19-28 display half-lives of 0.6-30+ days at pD 3.6; (b) at pH 5.9, residues 23-27 had half-lives of 2-20 days at laboratory temperatures; (c)

a The first row of the table gives the coil reference values employed; these include the +0.29 ppm shift effect for RH of Xaa when followed by a proline (Xaa-Pro, +0.17 for Gly-Pro) (39). All other entries are given as chemical shift deviations (CSD ) obs - rc). Expected ring current contributions were calculated using the Shift 3.0 program (www.scripps.edu/case/). b Values for the mean structures are given in each case. There is considerable variation in predicted ring currents within each ensemble; for example, in the major cluster the ring current calculations for G30HR2 varied from -2.30 to -2.80 ppm. The alternate (precise) ensemble was generated with tighter NOE distance constraints (see Supporting Information); it differs (heavy atomic rmsd over residues 22, 25, 26, 30, 31, 37, 38) from the two clusters within the conservative ensemble by 0.50 Å; the two clusters from the conservative CNS ensemble differ by 0.24 Å based on the same measure. This shows how sensitive chemical shifts are to quite small displacements in a tight hydrophobic cluster including aromatic rings.

the ring-NH of Trp25 was exchange-protected throughout the pH range 3.5-6.6. The indole NH 1 exchange rates were 0.23 and 0.79 h-1, respectively, at pD 6.0 and 6.6 (7 °C). Assuming no large effects of the TFE cosolvent upon intrinsic exchange rates (see Materials and Methods), these indicate a protection factor of ca. 260 for Trp25-NH 1. The slowest exchange was observed for the backbone NHs of Ile23 and Leu26 (ca. 0.009 days-1), which indicate protection factors 500-fold greater than that observed for the indole ring NH. The NH exchange data also provide a compelling argument for a helix that unravels exclusively from one end (the N-terminus): the C-terminus of the helix does not fray. Apparently, the Trp-cage serves as a very effective C-cap. DISCUSSION GLP-1 Versus Exendin-4: Structural Differences. The present NMR data provide a basis for quantitating differences in the secondary structuring preference associated with the exendin-4 versus GLP-1 sequence. The uninterrupted series of upfield HR shifts throughout the residue 12-16 span for exendin-4 (Figure 2) argues against the significant helix interruption or distortion that has been suggested to be a recognition determinant at the GLP-1 receptor (11, 13). Residues 18-19 also display larger upfield shifts in exendin-4 (Ala-Val-Arg20) than in GLP-1 (Ala-Ala-Lys20); this may reflect either the increased helicity at residue 16 (Glu vs Gly) or the effect of the Arg/Lys change at position 20. The only other differences are the greater upfield shifts for the R methines of residues 9-11 of GLP-1 (these sites appear to have a diminished helix propensity in exendin-4), but potential ring current effects from Tyr14 (present only in GLP1) place this analysis in doubt. In the GLP-1 ensemble previously reported for the DPC micelle-associated state (11), the distortions to the helix

around residues 15-17 are not as substantial as those suggested by the HR CSD histogram and differences in the NH exchange protection between the N- and C-terminal helices. The studies of Parker et al. (13) in 50% TFE defined the more converged helical span as Ala19-Val27. Our comparison of the TFE and micelle states clarifies the extent of helix disruption caused by Gly16. The HR and NH CSD comparisons (Figure 1) indicate that the helix propagates through Gly16 more often in the aqueous 30% TFE state. When bound to micelles, the major fraction of the GLP-1 conformations represents structures with two helices, in which Gly16 serves as the N-cap for the C-terminal helix. The earlier reported structure for GLP-1 (11) appears to have underestimated the flexibility that results due to this glycine location in the `helical' sequence. Thornton and Gorenstein suggested that a helix phase shift (placing Phe6, Tyr13, Phe22, and Trp25 on one face of the `helix') is important for membrane binding. They also suggested that the absence of Gly16, purported to effect the helix phase shift in GLP-1, in glucagon explains the 1000fold decrease in binding affinity to the GLP-1 receptor. Exendin-4, although it shares some biological actions of GLP-1, does not display similar helix distortions for the micelle-associated state. These results call into question the suggestion that the flexibility at Gly16 is an important determinant for GLP-1 receptor binding activity and are consistent with the results of mutational studies in which the G16A mutation does not decrease either activity or binding affinity (30, 31). RelatiVe Value of Chemical Shifts and NOEs in Peptide Structure Elucidation. The present study includes peptide `states' that differ widely in the degree and nature of structuring, in order of increasing structure: GLP-1, micelleassociated exendin-4, and exendin-4 in aqueous fluoro

NMR Structural Comparison of Exendin and GLP-1 alcohol, with only the latter system displaying significant tertiary structure as reflected by an extensive web of longrange NOEs. In addition, each system included a helical span and a segment that was extensively disordered. The relative performance of chemical shift versus NOE-distance-based structural analysis for these systems deserves some comment. In the Supporting Information, we present the results obtained using XPLOR to derive structure ensembles for each system with the same algorithm used for deriving distances from NOE intensities and a comparably strong NOE forcing potentials throughout. Some key observations are the following: (1) when aggressive high-precision distance constraints are used to generate exendin-4 structures, i/i+1 NOEs are the major source of these penalties (due to the conflict between i/i+1 and i/i+3 NOEs); (2) violations are more pronounced in the nonconverged N-terminal portions of the structures presumably due to either extensive segmental motion or dynamic helix unfolding; and (3) over the structured portion of the sequence, the aggressive protocol affords the same structure as the conservative CNS protocol. We suggest that for peptides in the absence of multiple i/i+n (n > 4) NOE connectivities (which will be present in hairpins and other rare instances in which peptides display stable structuring motifs due to hydrophobic cluster formation), NOE-based structure ensemble derivations do not appear to be warranted as they will not define structural features with any greater precision or confidence than could be achieved by using chemical shift deviations to determine secondary structure preferences in conjunction with modeling. In the absence of tertiary structure and nearby aryl residues, chemical shift deviations accurately reflect secondary structure preferences and the extent of folding. A combined analysis of RH and NH CSDs along the sequence may represent the optimal level of structural analysis for most peptides. Cooperative structure formation can be detected based on the temperature dependence of CSDs (24). In our opinion, any meaningful structuring will be apparent in such an analysis of chemical shift data. Tertiary Structure in a Modest-Sized Peptide. The most surprising finding of this study is the appearance of tertiary structure for exendin-4 in the solution state, particularly when fluoro alcohol cosolvents are present. Fluoro alcohols have been reported (32-34) to disrupt the tertiary (and quaternary) structure of many proteins, but there have been reports (35, 36) of increased structuring for designed sheet structures in water/alcohol mixtures (including aqueous TFE), and the helix-stabilizing effect of fluoro alcohols is well-established. With exendin-4, fluoro alcohol addition stabilized (see Figure 3B) tertiary structure, the Trp-cage feature (Figures 6), within the C-terminal half of the sequence. For panel B of Figure 6, we selected a member of the major conformer cluster which displays a single side chain conformer for both Asn28 and Ser33 with a hydrogen bond from the side chain OH of Ser33 and the backbone carbonyl of Asn28 (vide supra). Chemical shift comparisons (Table 2, vide infra) indicate a fundamentally similar tertiary structure in 18-30% glycol. In the absence of added fluoroalcohol, however, the population of conformers with tertiary structure appears to be significantly diminisheds F ) 0.47 in 30% glycol at 320 K based on the magnitude of the diagnostic structural shifts. In the present case, essentially complete formation of a protein-like fold can be induced with the addition of as little

Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 44, 2001 13197 as 8 vol-% of a fluoro alcohol. These results bolster other data that we have presented (37, 38) which indicate that fluoro alcohols can enhance the solvophobic effect and that this is probably a source of the structure-inducing effects that these cosolvents display with many peptides. The same structure is retained at high fluoro alcohol concentrations (36% HFIP, 60% TFE), that stands in contrast to the tertiary structure disruption observed for proteins under such conditions. However, the Trp-cage is completely absent in the micelle-associated state of exendin-4. The evidence for the structural details of the Trp-cage fold, observations that reveal the extent of fluxionality and the cooperativity of the folding process, and some hypotheses concerning the folding pathway follow. The intent is to establish whether the Trp-cage can serve as a paradigm for quantitative studies of the importance of the hydrophobic effect in polypeptide fold stabilization. Since chemical shifts were not employed in deriving the NMR structure, they can provide a confirmation of the NOEderived structural features of the Trp-cage. The close proximity and specific spatial relationships of numerous protons to the two aromatic rings produce very large chemical shift deviations. Table 2 shows the protons with the largest structuring shifts and how these chemical shifts vary with medium and temperature. These shifts are nearly as large as any reported for proline and glycine residues in well-folded non-heme proteins; shifts of this magnitude would not be observed if the folded state population was small. If the NMR structure ensemble correctly reflects the structure and the motions within the folded state energy well, it should predict the chemical shifts. Ring current shift calculations were performed for both clusters within the conservatively derived ensemble and an ensemble derived using tighter constraints. The structure ensemble fails to reproduce the exact relative shift deviations, but the direction and relative sizes of the shifts observed are in general accord with the model predictions. Notably, numerous large shielding effects and the unique deshielding effect at Pro31-R/ 3 are predicted by the ensemble. The NMR structure ensemble predicts larger ring current shifts than those observed for Pro37-R/ 3, but somewhat smaller shifts for the Gly30-CH2. The real structure probably has a more fluxional hydrophobic cluster than that reflected in the NMR ensembles. In addition, comparison of the calculated and observed ring current effects suggests that the time-averaged structure places Pro37 somewhat further away from and in a slightly different disposition relative to the indole ring. The structural implications of the experimental shifts are being tested using simulations of the dynamics of the folded state in a water box. Notable stability is indicated for the Trp-cage folding motif by a number of NMR-derived parameters: chemical shifts, their temperature dependence, and NH exchange protection. Very large upfield shifts for Gly30-R2, Pro37- 3, and Pro37-R are diagnostic of the Trp-cage fold (Table 2). Upon cooling to 280 K, these chemical shift deviations increase by 7-20%:Gly30-R2 appears at 1.12 ppm, 3.02 ppm upfield of its expected location. A more complete determination of the temperature dependence of these chemical shifts is available at pH 3.5; the structure loss on warming appears to be equal to or less than 5.5% for a 10 °C temperature increase in the 5-45 °C range. The folded state is significantly populated even at 50 °C. Some of the NHs of exendin-4 are remarkably

resistant to exchange. The 102.4 protection factor observed for the indole NH (t1/2 ) 3.0 h, at pD 6, 7 °C) argues for substantial tertiary structure stability and the lack of local unfolding events that would break the N H f OdC-Ala35 H-bond. The exchange half-lives of the backbone NHs in the portion of the helix that is capped within the Trp-cage are much longer than those we have observed for helical peptides in this medium. The average backbone NH protection factor over residues 23-27 of exendin-4 in 30% TFE appears to be 105.1 at pD 6.6 (9 °C). Amide exchange protection data indicate facile unfolding in the N-terminal portion of the helix; protection factors fall off rapidly from 105 at the NH of Ile23 to 102.0 at Ala18 and to less than 100.8 from Glu16 to the N-terminus. Based on the data obtained thus far, particularly the disorder at the extreme N-terminus and the fraying of the N-terminal turns of the helix, it seems highly unlikely that the formation of the Trp-cage structure requires the first 14-17 residues of the exendin-4 sequence. The Leu21-Pro38 segment of exendin-4 may be the smallest protein-like folding unit observed to date and the basis for designing even smaller "mini-proteins" based on this helix/ Trp-cage motif. Folding Requisites and CooperatiVity. In all of our studies of the temperature dependence of chemical shifts, warming leads to similar fractional shifts toward random coil norms for essentially all2 of the protons within the Phe22-Pro38 span that display large structuring shifts. We view this as compelling evidence that Trp-cage formation is a two-state folding process3 in 30% TFE. There is, however, evidence that supports the presence of helical structuring without complete Trp-cage formation. The smaller CSDs observed for R methines of the helix do not melt out as readily. In the micelle-associated state, the helix is fully formed with no trace of Trp-cage formation. Furthermore, over residues 1827, excluding Ile23 and Leu26 (which are further upfield due to ring current effects), the average HR CSDs are -0.308 ( 0.088 and -0.376 ( 0.076 ppm, respectively, in 30% TFE and 30% glycol. A shift of -0.39 ppm is generally equated with 100% helicity (26). This suggests that the helix is 85+%
2 The exceptions are 31-2,3 and 30R3 resonance shifts. The 313 resonance moves further upfield from the random coil value on warming and under other conditions where the complete Trp-cage is less populated or more fluxional. The fractional loss of upfield shift of 30R3 (but not the more shifted diastereotopic 30R2) on warming is significantly smaller than that of the other ring current shifted resonances. These observations can be rationalized by assuming that the unfolded state has a residual hydrophobic cluster (Trp25/Gly30/Pro31) similar to that observed in the DPC micelle-associated state.

populated in aqueous glycol conditions under which the Trpcage tertiary structure is present in only 47% of the conformational equilibrium mixture. The helical region appears to have a more regular R-conformation prior to tertiary structure formation; when prolines dock at the accessible solvent-exposed surface of aryl side chains (Phe22 and Trp25) in the helix, the packing optimization associated with docking apparently causes some distortions of the R-helix. A specific indole-DPC interaction may be responsible for the loss of tertiary structure in the micelle-bound state. It is well established that indoles partition into membranes (40) and that tryptophan residues prefer to be located in membrane-spanning units (41), particularly near the positive PC headgroups (42). Studies are underway to test these hypotheses by synthesizing a minimized version of the Trp-cage motif that is fully folded in aqueous medium. These constructs will be used to establish the folding pathway and to confirm the cooperativity of folding in water, the biologically significant medium. Structural Analogies to the Trp-Cage Fold. The burial of tryptophan rings also appears to be an important feature in a wide variety of peptide structuring and binding phenomena; e.g., the hydrophobic clustering of a tryptophan ring and leucine side chain has been observed in a cyclic pentapeptide (43), the clustering of the side chains of Trp21 and Ile19 has been reported to be an important structural determinant in endothelins (25, 44-46), and Trp residues appear at numerous binding sites (vide infra). However, we have found no close analogy to this specific Trp-cage in protein structures, although some similar component features can be noted: one of the tryptophans in a WW domain is encaged with a leucine side chain located immediately on the face of the indole ring (47); in the archetypal SH3 domain (48, 49), both Trp residues show some hydrophobic interactionssTrp43 has isoleucines both above and below the C 3-C 3 edge of the
3 All of our data indicate that conformers of the all-trans-Xaa-Pro isomer are in sufficiently rapid equilibrium to result in populationaveraged chemical shifts. As a result, the temperature dependence of chemical shifts reveals the changes in the folded population. If all CSDs are due to a single folded state, the fractional loss of the CSD at each position should reflect the loss of structure at each locus. Thus, the observation of identical fractional losses2 of shift deviations upon warming indicates the same degree of structure loss throughout the residue 21-38 span. The simplest rationale for this is a fully cooperative two-state equilibrium with only fully folded and fully disordered states present. We suggest that, for systems in a rapid folding equilibrium, the response of chemical shifts throughout the sequence to perturbations of the folding equilibrium provides the ultimate test of cooperativity.

NMR Structural Comparison of Exendin and GLP-1 ring; Trp42 has a parallel proline ring (Pro57) in close proximity (see Figure 7). The SH3 domain has one additional aryl/proline ring-stacking interaction; Pro63 is parallel to Phe10 and in close spatial proximity. Both of the Pro/Trp stacking interactions in SH3 produce upfield shifts (0.20-1.66 ppm) for the proline-R, 3,3 resonances, but the shifts for the proline perched on Trp42 are not as large as those observed for Pro37 in the Trp-cage of exendin-4. In some analogy to Pro37 of exendin-4, Pro63 of SH3 displays an R methine resonance that is well-upfield of the  methylene signals. Exposed tryptophan residues are the key feature of cellulose binding proteins (50-52), and the aryl rings of Trp (and Tyr) residues frequently appear as the side or bottom walls of receptors for saccharides (53-58) and proline-rich peptides (for example, SH3 and WW domains). In this regard, we note that the axial hydrogens on one face of a sugar ring present a similar surface to that presented by the face of proline that is cis to the R methine. The closest analogies to the Trp-cage structure of exendin-4 that we have been able to find are in structures reported for complexes of SH3 domains and proline-rich peptides (59, 60). The Trp and Pro residues (and Phe22) of the Trp-cage and two views of SH3/peptide complexes are shown in Figure 7. The intramolecular proline of SH3 (Pro57) clearly occupies a position comparable to Pro37 in the Trp-cage (but on the opposing face of the indole ring). The actual position of Pro37 is consistently occupied by a peptide arginine residue in the SH3/peptide complexes, reflecting a recognition determinant associated with a salt-bridging interaction with Asp23 of SH3. The prolines in the peptides bound to SH3 appear in positions that bear some analogy to the locations of Pro31 and Pro36 in the Trp-cage. These analogies suggest that quantitative studies of the energetics of proline association in the Trp-cage may provide insights into recognition phenomena involved in signaling by common protein motifs. Implications in Defining the BioactiVe Conformation at the GLP-1 Receptor. For peptides with conformational versatility, there is always reason to doubt that any particular structural feature (or structuring preference) observed in any state other than the receptor-bound state can be used to derive the requisites for binding. In the present case, however, one significant structural preference, a well-converged helix over residues 18-27, has now been observed for both GLP-1 and exendin-4 in the solution-state and when associated with DPC micelles. The latter may mimic the context of the peptide just prior to binding to the receptor. Exendin-4 displays a greater intrinsic propensity toward the formation of a monomeric helix than GLP-1. This is attributed, at least in part, to the absence in exendin-4 of the helix-interrupting glycine residue at position 16 of GLP-1. CD data (9) indicate that GLP-1 is significantly helical only in helix-favoring media (aqueous TFE or DPC micelles) or at high concentrations when helix bundle formation occurs. In exendin-4, the helix goes much further toward the N-terminus; this feature and the efficient C-capping of the helix provided by the Trpcage may reduce the entropic cost of binding at a receptor that requires the C-terminal helix state (13). The pronounced helical tendency of exendin-4 in conjunction with its binding at the GLP-1 receptor argues against the importance of Gly16 of GLP-1 as a flexible linker and biorecognition feature (11).
