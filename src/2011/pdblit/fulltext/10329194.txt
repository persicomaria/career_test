Abstract A major extracellular endoglucanase purified to homogeneity from Thermoascus aurantiacus had a Mr of 34 kDa and a pI of 3.7 and was optimally active at 70­80 °C and pH 4.0­4.4. It was stable at pH 2.8­6.8 at 50 °C for 48 h and maintained its secondary structure and folded conformation up to 70 °C at pH 5.0 and 2.8, respectively. A 33-amino acid sequence at the N terminus showed considerable homology with 14 microbial endoglucanases having highly conserved 8 amino acids (positions 10­17) and Gly, Pro, Gly, and Pro at positions 8, 22, 23, and 32, respectively. The enzyme is rich in Asp (15%) and Glu (10%) with a carbohydrate content of 2.7%. Polyclonal antibodies of endoglucanase cross-reacted with their own antigen and with other purified cellulases from T. aurantiacus. The endoglucanase was specific for polymeric substrates with highest activity toward carboxymethyl cellulose followed by barley b-glucan and lichenan. It preferentially cleaved the internal glycosidic bonds of Glcn and MeUmbGlcn and possessed an extended substrate-binding site with five subsites. The data indicate that the endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 5. Ó 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Microbial cellulases have attracted considerable research and commercial interest due to their enormous potential applications in biotechnology and industry [1,2]. Many cellulolytic microorganisms, especially fungi, when cultured on a cellulosic carbon source, produce an extracellular cellulase system consisting of endoglucanase [endo-1,4-b-D -glucanase or 1,4-b-D -glucan glucanohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.4], exoglucanase [exo-1,4-b-D -glucanase or 1,4-b-D -glucan cellobiohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.91], and b-glucosidase (cellobiase or b-D -glucoside glucohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.21] in free and often in multiple forms [3,4]. In general, cellulases are bimodular proteins with a large catalytic and a small cellulose binding module linked by a short highly glycosylated protein sequence rich in Ser and Pro [5].

architecture, and three-dimensional (3-D) structures of bacterial and fungal cellulases led to prediction of their role in cellulose hydrolysis and to realization of their wide range of potential applications [6­8]. The current state of knowledge suggests that new and improved cellulase and related enzymes are necessary to increase the efficiency and economics of various biotechnological processes. Endoglucanases preferentially cleave the internal glycosidic bonds of cellulosic chains and act synergistically with cellobiohydrolase and b-glucosidase during the solubilization of crystalline cellulose [8­10]. Also, the endoglucanases play key roles in increasing the yield of fruit juices, beer filtration, and oil extraction, in improving the nutritive quality of bakery products and animal feed, in enhancing the brightness, smoothness, and overall quality of cellulosic garments, and in producing fungal protoplast and hybrid strains [1,2]. Specifications of these applications indeed suggest the necessity for a wide range of endoglucanases with varying pH and temperature optima, stability, and

substrate specificities. Thermostable endoglucanases active over a wide range of pH with broad substrate specificities are preferred for many of these applications. The thermophilic fungus T. aurantiacus produces high levels of cellulase and hemicellulase components when grown on lignocellulosic carbon sources such as corncob and cereal straw [11,12]. These enzyme components are remarkably stable over a wide range of pH and temperatures [12,13] and appear to have tremendous commercial potential. The present paper describes the purification, biochemical characterization, and mode of action of a major endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus. Part of this work has been presented in preliminary form [12,13].

pNPL and pooled based on the activity peaks. The desalted peaks were assayed for endo- and exoglucanase activities using CM-cellulose and Avicel, respectively. The endoglucanase sample was concentrated and finally purified using a Mono-Q column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Enzyme assays Endo- and exoglucanases were assayed using CMcellulose (medium viscosity) and Avicel PH 101 as described [16]. b-Glucosidase was assayed using pNPG [14], while the xylanase was assayed using birchwood xylan [17]. Activity on pNPC and pNPL was determined by measuring the pNP release as described [14]. The unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 lmol of reducing sugar or pNP per min under the respective assay conditions. Protein determination Protein was determined using bicinchoninic acid [18]. Absorbance at 280 nm was measured to monitor protein content in the column fractions. Biochemical characterization of endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus Homogeneity and molecular mass ðMr Þ. These were determined by SDS­PAGE, gel filtration, and IEF­ PAGE. The SDS­PAGE [19] was performed using BioRad mini-protean II electrophoresis unit. The gel filtration of endoglucanase (6 lg) and standard protein markers (thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; bovine gamma globulin, 158 kDa; chicken ovalbumin, 44 kDa; equine myoglobin 17 kDa; vitamin B12, 1.35 kDa) was carried out separately on a Sephacryl S-300 column (XK 1:6 Â 100 cm), equilibrated with 25 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 10 mM sodium chloride and eluted at a flow rate of 0.75 ml minÀ1 . The fractions (2 ml each) were assayed for endoglucanase and protein. The Mr of endoglucanase was determined using the plot of log Mr of standard protein markers versus their relative mobility (SDS­PAGE) or elution volume (gel filtration). IEF­PAGE was performed using a Novex X-mini IEF cell system according to the instructions given in the Novex precast gel booklet and Novex precast gels (5%) containing 2% ampholyte covering a pH range between 3.0 and 7.0. The pI of endoglucanase was determined using the plot of relative mobility of standard protein markers versus their pI. pH and temperature optima. The pH and temperature optima of endoglucanase were determined by measuring the activity as described above using citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 2.8­6.8) at temperatures ranging from 30 to 90 °C.

Materials and methods Materials T. aurantiacus IMI 216529 was obtained from the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI), Egham, Surrey, United Kingdom. All chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from either Sigma or BDH. The electrophoresis solutions and chromatography media were purchased from Anachem, Luton, United Kingdom and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd., Amersham Place, United Kingdom, respectively. Production and purification of endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus A crude cellulase-rich fraction of T. aurantiacus supplied by Cayla, Toulouse, France, was prepared as described [14]. The cellulase-rich fraction (15 g) was desalted on a Bio-Gel P6 DG column (XK 2:6 Â 100 cm) and fractionated on a DEAE­Sepharose column (XK 2:6 Â 90 cm) and the bound endoglucanase was eluted and chromatographed on an Ultrogel AcA 44 column (XK 1:6 Â 100 cm) as described [14]. Fractions containing high levels of endoglucanase were pooled, concentrated, and applied onto p-aminobenzyl-1-thio-b-cellobioside coupled with Sepharose 4B affinity column, prepared as described [15]. The column was eluted first by using 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and then with the same buffer containing 100 mM glucose and 100 mM cellobiose. Fractions were assayed using pNPC2 and

Thermostability: (i) Residual activity. This was determined after incubating the endoglucanase (0.1 mg/ml) for 48 h between 50 and 80 °C as a function of pH (2.8­6.8). (ii) Analysis of secondary structure by circular dichroism (CD). The secondary structure stability of endoglucanase was monitored between 20 and 95 °C as described [20]. The possible refolding of endoglucanase incubated at 70 °C for 30 min was investigated upon cooling to 20 °C for 60 min. The 30 ll of enzyme (2 mg mlÀ1 ) equilibrated with 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, was loaded onto a 0.01-cm CD cell. The temperature was increased from 20 to 95 °C using an online temperature control unit. At different temperatures and time intervals quadruplicate scans were performed between 180 and 240 nm using a Jobin Yvonne polarizing spectrophotometer CD6. The molecular elipticity was determined using the mean Mr of amino acid residue (107) based on the amino acid composition. The a-helix and b-sheet were determined using the Contin program [21]. (iii) Thermodynamics of unfolding by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Endoglucanase (1.5 mg) was dissolved in 25 ml of 0.05 M glycine buffer, pH 2.8, was concentrated to 2 ml using an Amicon cell (10 ml) fitted with an Omega membrane (10 kDa, Mr cut off). The enzyme solution was placed in the DSC cell and the temperature increased to 100 °C to follow the thermodynamics of protein unfolding. Scans were performed in triplicate using a Microcal MC-2 Scanning Calorimeter with a scan rate of 60° hÀ1 . Data were analyzed using Microcal Origin Software. Peak areas were integrated and a thermodynamic model was fitted. The energetic parameters were determined according to the method of Goldenberg and Creighton [22]. Amino acid composition and carbohydrate content. Endoglucanase (250 lg) was hydrolyzed with 1 ml of 6 M HCl containing 0.1% (v/v) phenol in vacuo at 110 °C for 24, 48, and 72 h. Amino acids were quantitatively determined using a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyser. Cys and Met were determined as cysteic acid and methionine sulfone, respectively, after oxidation with performic acid. The carbohydrate content was determined as described [23], using 10 lg of endoglucanase and mannose as the standard. N-Terminal amino acid sequencing. Endoglucanase (25 lg) dissolved in 15 ll distilled water was used for Nterminal amino acid sequence analysis using Model 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA), working in the pulsed liquid phase. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was searched for homology in the protein database [24]. Preparation of endoglucanase antibody and its crossreactivity with T. aurantiacus cellulases. Endoglucanase (100 lg) was mixed with equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant [25] and injected subcutaneously into a mouse in three doses, at monthly intervals. Two test

bleeds were performed, 1 week after each boost injection. After the second test bleed, the mice were anesthetized using CO2 . A 1-ml blood sample was removed, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and transferred to 4 °C overnight before spinning at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The serum stored at 4 °C in 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide was used as a source of antibody. The immuno cross-reactivity of endoglucanase antibody with its antigen and purified exoglucanases and b-glucosidase from T. aurantiacus was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay [26]. Substrate specificity. The endoglucanase activity toward pNP-glycosides was tested by measuring pNP release [14], while activity toward disaccharides, pNPC, pNPL, salicin, methyl-b- and a-glucosides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides was determined by measuring the release of either glucose or reducing sugar [16,27]. All assays were performed using 0.5­1.0 lg of endoglucanase and 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, for 15­30 min at 60 °C. Action on CM-celluloses. This was studied by determining the reducing sugars released, following the change in specific viscosity (g), and by analyzing the products released using HPLC. CM-celluloses of low, medium and high viscosities and with the degrees of substitution (DS) 0.63, 0.78, 0.92, 1.31, 1.73, and 2.1 were used. For the determination of reducing sugars released [27], 2 ml of reaction mixture containing 5 mg mlÀ1 of CM-cellulose, 0.5 lg of endoglucanase in 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, was incubated at 60 °C for 15 min. The change in g of 1% (w/v) CMcellulose by endoglucanase (3 lg) was determined using the above buffer at 40 °C for 0­120 min with Fisons VHB-590-150L Viscometer as described [19]. For the HPLC analysis of products released from CM-celluloses, 0.45 ml of 0.5% CM-cellulose, 0.25 ml of 100 mM citrate phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, and 2.0 lg of endoglucanase in Eppendorf tubes were incubated at 60 °C for 10­60 min and the reaction was terminated by placing the Eppendorf tubes in a boiling bath for 5 min. Any unhydrolyzed CM-cellulose was removed by adding 1 ml of propan-2-ol and centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 2 min). The supernatant mixed with acetonitrile (1:2) was analyzed (50 ll) by HPLC using an NH2 ­Spherisorb column (0:25 Â 10 cm) fitted to a Gynkotech HPLC system with evaporative light scattering detector, and acetonitrile/water (70:30) as a solvent at a flow rate of 0.25 ml minÀ1 . Action on H3 PO4 -swollen Avicel. Tubes containing 1.5 ml of 0.2% (w/v) H3 PO4 -swollen Avicel were spun (10,000 rpm for 10 min), and the supernatants (1.25 ml) were discarded. Then 0.75 ml of 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, and 1 lg of endoglucanase were added to each tube. The total volume in each tube was made up to 1.25 ml with distilled water and incubated at 60 °C for 24 h. Tubes were removed at different time

intervals, placed in a boiling bath for 5 min, and cooled to room temperature before centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min). The supernatants were analysed by HPLC as described above. Action on barley b-glucan and lichenan. A 0.5 ml reaction mixture containing 2.25 mg polysaccharide in 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, was incubated at 60 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of 0.5 lg endoglucanase. At different time intervals (10­120 min), the reaction mixture was removed and placed in a boiling bath for 5 min. Any un-hydrolysed substrate was removed using 1 ml of propan-2-ol and centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 5 min). The supernatants were analyzed by HPLC as described above. Action on Glcn and MeUmbGlcn . A reaction mixture containing 0.2 ml of either Glcn (100 lg) or MeUmbGlcn (20­100 lM), 0.05 ml of 25 mM citrate phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, and 0.05 ml of enzyme (0.5­2 lg) was incubated at 50 °C for 4 h. A 25 ll sample was withdrawn at different time intervals (10­240 min) and mixed with 25 ll of acetonitrile/water (70:30). Products released from Glcn were analyzed by HPLC as described above, while those from MeUmbGlcn were analyzed by using BioRad Biosil Polyol column (25 Â 4:6 cm) fitted to a Walters HPLC system with UV detector (316 nm) and acetonitrile/water (70:30) as solvent at a flow rate of 1 ml minÀ1 . Kinetics of bond cleavage, bond cleavage frequencies, and subsite interaction energies were determined as described [28­31].

contaminating exoglucanase and yielded 24 mg protein with a specific activity of 35 lmol minÀ1 mg proteinÀ1 at 70 °C on medium-viscosity CM-cellulose at pH 4.0. Biochemical and catalytic properties of endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus Homogeneity, Mr , and pI: Purified endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus was homogeneous as judged by SDS­PAGE under denatured and nondenatured conditions, gel filtration, and IEF­PAGE.The denatured Mr of endoglucanase was 34 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Under native conditions, the electrophoretic mobility of endoglucanase corresponded to a Mr of 37 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1), but the native Mr determined by gel filtration was 31.6 kDa. This endoglucanase was an acidic protein with pI 3.7 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). pH and temperature optima: The endoglucanase was optimally active between 70 and 80 °C and between pH 4.0 and 4.4. At 90 °C, the enzyme was optimally active at pH 5.2, but the activity rapidly decreased above 90 °C. Also, the optimal activity obtained at 90 °C was only 2/3 of that at 70 and 80 °C. Thermostability: (i) Residual activity. At all pH values tested, the enzyme retained its full activity at 50 °C for 48 h. At pH 5.2 and up to 60 °C, the endoglucanase was stable for 48 h, but at 70 °C and at pH 5.2, the enzyme retained only 40% of its original activity after 48 h. At 60

Results Purification of endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus A major extracellular endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus was purified by DEAE­Sepharose, Ultrogel AcA 44, p-aminobenzyl-1-thio-b-cellobioside coupled to Sepharose 4B and Mono-Q column chromatographies. During DEAE­Sepharose column chromatography, a xylanase peak and a b-glucosidase peak were eluted in the buffer wash, while the bound endoglucanase together with exoglucanase and b-glucosidase were eluted with a linear NaCl (0­0.5 M) gradient. Fractions containing high levels of endoglucanase were pooled, concentrated, and fractionated on an Ultrogel AcA 44 column, which separated the b-glucosidase from endo- and exoglucanase activities. Use of p-aminobenzyl-1-thio-b-cellobioside coupled to Sepharose 4B affinity column separated the endoglucanase sample into four main protein peaks. A major endoglucanase and two major exoglucanase peaks were eluted when the column was eluted with 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 100 mM D -glucose and cellobiose, respectively. Subsequent chromatography of a major endoglucanase sample on a Mono-Q column separated the endoglucanase from the

and 70 °C and at pH above and below 5.2, the enzyme was less stable. When the temperature was increased to 80 °C, the endoglucanase rapidly lost its activity between pH 2.8 and 6.8. (ii) Analysis of secondary structure by CD. A summary of the secondary structure analysis is given in Table 1. Up to 70 °C, the endoglucanase retained its secondary structure, although there was a small change in apparent secondary structure (a-helix and b-sheet) at and above 60 °C. At 80 °C, the endoglucanase rapidly lost its a-helix structure. Despite incubating this enzyme at 70 °C for 30 min and subsequent cooling to 20 °C for 60 min, it remained unfolded and denatured. (iii) Energetics of unfolding. The conformational changes and inactivation of endoglucanase at high temperatures were confirmed by DSC analysis. The mean result from four scans is shown in Fig. 2. The enzyme was stable up to 70 °C, but above this temperature it was in the unfolded state. The DSC scan of endoglucanase approximated to a non-2 state model of protein unfolding with a v2 value of 1.0794. This model indicated that the protein underwent two stages of transition, one at 76.6 °C (Tm1 ) and the other at 81 °C (Tm2 ). The calorimetric heat (H) refers to heat change per mole, while Hv is the heat change per unfolding unit. The ratio of H=Hv is considered to be the number of cooperative units per mole. The ratio of H1 =Hv1 at Tm1 was 0.465, while the ratio of H2 =Hv2 at Tm2 was 3.19. Amino acid composition and carbohydrate content: The endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus contained high levels of Asp (15.4%) followed by Gly, Ala, Glu, and Ser (8­ 10%), while the Met content of this enzyme was 2.2%. The levels of Cys, His, and Arg ranged from 0.4 to 2.2%. The remaining amino acids were in the range of 4­6%, while the carbohydrate content of this enzyme was only 2.7%. N-Terminal amino acid sequence alignment: A highly conserved Gly at position 8 together with a highly conserved stretch of 8 amino acids (at positions 10­17 of T. aurantiacus endoglucanase) were present in most endoglucanases (Fig. 3). Also, three highly conserved residues, Pro, Gly, and Pro at positions 22, 23, and 32 of T. aurantiacus endoglucanase, were identified in most

endoglucanases. The highest identity of N-terminal amino acid sequence of T. aurantiacus endoglucanase was observed with endoglucanases from Aspergillus niger (69.2%), Aspergillus kawachii (66.7%), Aspergillus aculeatus (57.5­63.6%), Phanerochaete chrysosporium (57.5%), and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (54.5%). Immuno-cross-reactivity: Polyclonal antibodies of T. aurantiacus endoglucanase cross-reacted not only with its own antigen but also with purified exoglucanases and b-glucosidase from the same fungus. Thus, this endoglucanase appears to possess a high degree of homology with other cellulase components of T. aurantiacus. Substrate specificity: The endoglucanase was purified based on its high activity toward CM-cellulose and this was therefore the substrate used in the standardization prior to the analysis of its activity toward other substrates. Specificity toward pNP-glycosides. The endoglucanase showed the highest activity toward pNPC (0:02 lmol minÀ1 mg proteinÀ1 ), but did not release pNP from pNPL. The activity toward pNPmaltoside (a or b), pNPmelibiose, and pNPgentiobiose was much lower ð0:003­0:005 lmol minÀ1 mg proteinÀ1 Þ than that toward pNPC. Derivatives of pNP or oNP monosaccharides

tested were all hydrolyzed to a limited extent with the glucopyranosyl derivative being the preferred substrate. Specificity toward disaccharides and other derivatives. The determination of glucose released showed that the endoglucanase was active on cellobiose, pNPC, pNPL, salicin, and methyl-b-D -glucoside, but inactive on lactose, maltose, sucrose, melibiose, trehalose, raffinose, arbutin, amygdalin, esculin, methyl-a-D -glucoside, and gentiobiose. Specificity toward polysaccharides. The endoglucanase showed the highest activity toward CM-cellulose ð18 lmol minÀ1 mg proteinÀ1 at 60 °C, pH 3.5). Barley bglucan and lichenan were also hydrolyzed by this enzyme, but to a lesser extent than CM-cellulose with specific activities of 9.3 and 8:2 lmol minÀ1 mg proteinÀ1 , respectively. The enzyme was inactive on CM-pachyman, laminarin, and Avicel. Action on CM-cellulose, H3 PO4 -swollen Avicel, barley b-glucan, and lichenan. (i) CM-cellulose. The endoglucanase was active on low-, medium-, and high-viscosity CM-celluloses, but the level of reducing sugars released decreased with an increase in CM-cellulose viscosity (Fig. 4A). Similarly, there was a decrease in the level of reducing sugars released with an increase in DS of CMcelluloses (Fig. 4A). No reducing sugars were released from CM-cellulose with a DS higher than 1.73 (Fig. 4A). The endoglucanase decreased the viscosity of low-, medium-, and high-viscosity CM-celluloses from 28, 175, and 520 to 10, 30, and 50 centipois, respectively, in 10 min at 40 °C (Fig. 4B). It also decreased the viscosity of CM-celluloses with DS 0.78, 0.92, 1.31, and 1.73 from 450, 70, 48, and 2.75 to 70, 42, 40, and 2.0 centipois, respectively, in 10 min at 40 °C (Fig. 4C). HPLC analysis showed that the endoglucanase released series of cellooligosaccharides from all CM-celluloses with cellobiose and cellotriose as main products. However, the level of cello-oligosaccharides produced was decreased from low

to high viscosity and with an increase in DS of CMcelluloses. Notably, the action of endoglucanase was influenced by an increase in DS of CM-cellulose much more than an increase in its viscosity. (ii) H3 PO4 -swollen Avicel. HPLC analysis showed that the endoglucanase released mainly cellobiose and cellotriose from H3 PO4 -swollen Avicel (Fig. 5A). Only a low level of glucose was detected during the initial stages, but it increased slightly during the later stages of the reaction. (iii) Barley b-glucan and lichenan. The endoglucanase released a series of oligosaccharides from barley b-glucan as shown in Fig. 5B. A steady increase in the levels of cellobiose, cellotriose, and cellotetraose was observed during 60 min of hydrolysis. Up to 120 min, the levels of cellobiose and cellotriose continued to increase at a constant rate with the level of cellotetraose increasing at a lower rate. The level of cellopentaose did not increase after 60 min of incubation. The production of Glcn from the hydrolysis of lichenan was rapid during the initial stages of the reaction, with cellopentaose and cellobiose produced in the highest quantities (Fig. 5C). The concentration of cellopentaose decreased after 20 min, but the levels of cellobiose and cellotriose steadily increased throughout the reaction period. The level of Glcn produced from lichenan was approximately half of that obtained from barley b-glucan (Figs. 5B and C). However, the amount of glucose released from both substrates remained low throughout the incubation. Mode of action on unsubstituted and MeUmb substituted Glcn The hydrolysis of Glcn (n ¼ 2­5) by endoglucanase is shown in Figs. 6A­D. The endoglucanase was least

Based on HPLC anaylsis of products released from MeUmbGlcn by T. aurantiacus endoglucanase as a function of time, the bond cleavage frequencies and the Kcat values were determined and are summarized in Fig. 7. The bond cleavage frequencies revealed that the endoglucanase preferentially cleaved the heterosidic bonds of MeUmbGlc, MeUmbGlc2 , and MeUmbGlc3 , but the turnover number on MeUmbGlc3 was 10 times higher than that on MeUmbGlc2 . As the number of glycosidic linkages in the substrate increased, as with MeUmbGlc4 and MeUmbGlc5 , the enzyme preferred the second or third glycosidic bond from the aglycone end of MeUmbGlcn . The highest turnover numbers were obtained for MeUmbGlc4 , but the cleavage of a specific bond became more random with MeUmbGlc5 than with other MeUmbGlcn tested (Fig. 7). The kinetic data were translated into postulated subsite interaction energies to visualize the cooperative sites for sugar binding on either side of the active site (Fig. 8). This approach does not allow the evaluation of the affinities of the subsites adjacent to the catalytic groups, i.e., subsites )I and +I, when the subsites are numbered on the right and left of the catalytic groups with positive and negative Roman numerals, respectively [31]. The results indicated that there are at least five sugar binding sites in the active site of T. aurantiacus endoglucanase, of which at least three (subsites +II, )II, and )III) form preferential binding sites in the sugar moieties (Fig. 8).

active on cellobiose, but hydrolyzed cellotriose to yield cellobiose and glucose although the overall hydrolysis of cellotriose was poor (Figs. 6A and B). Cellotetraose and cellopentaose were rapidly hydrolyzed, yielding mainly cellobiose and cellotriose (Figs. 6C and D). Glucose was also detected in both cellotetraose and cellopentaose reaction mixtures. The levels of cellotriose in cellopentaose reaction mixture decreased during later stages of incubation in accordance with a small increase in cellobiose and glucose concentrations (Fig. 6D).

A key step in the purification of T. aurantiacus endoglucanase was the use of an affinity column, p-aminobenzyl-1-thio-b-cellobioside coupled to Sepharose 4B, for the separation of the major endoglucanase from two exoglucanases and other contaminating proteins. This affinity gel has been used to remove the contaminating endoglucanase from cellobiohydrolases of Trichoderma reesei [15] and Penicillium pinophilum [9] and for the separation of a low-affinity endoglucanase from cellulase components of Fusarium oxysporum [32]. Nevertheless, a novel strategy used in the present work was the absence of glucose in the initial elution buffer, which facilitated the binding of endoglucanase to the affinity column together with exoglucanases. Subsequent elution of the affinity column with a buffer containing glucose facilitated the isolation of endoglucanase, while further elution with a buffer containing cellobiose resulted in the elution and separation of two forms of exoglucanases. Thus, the use of this affinity gel facilitated the separation of endoglucanase from exoglucanases and other contaminating proteins. Thermostability is an important criterion of enzymes, especially for cellulases and hemicellulases with enormous

potential applications in biotechnology and industry [2]. Hence, the thermostability of T. aurantiacus endoglucanase was studied by measuring the residual activity at different temperatures and pH as a function of time, by analyzing the secondary structure, and by determining the energetics of unfolding. All three methods confirmed that this enzyme was stable and retained its secondary structure and folded conformation up to 70 °C. Above 70 °C, the endoglucanase was less stable and did not retain its secondary structure and folded conformation as observed by CD and DSC. Also, the thermal inactivation of endoglucanase of T. aurantiacus was found to be irreversible as observed in T. reesei cellulase components [33,34]. Nevertheless, the data showed that the endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus is more stable than endoglucanases studied from other fungi [33­36]. Sequence alignment of the first 33 amino acids suggests that the endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 5. Relatively low ($20­25%) sequence identity between the members of family 5 led to an additional classification of its members into eight subfamilies, A1­A8 [37­39]. So far, the 3-D structures of eight cellulases belonging to family 5, subfamilies A1­A4, and two mannanases belonging to

family 5, subfamilies A7 and A8, have been resolved (see http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/index.html). Based on Nterminal amino acid sequence comparison of family 5 cellulases, it was suggested that the endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus should be placed in subfamily A6 [38]. A complete protein sequence together with the 3-D structure analysis should reveal whether this enzyme really belongs to a new subfamily of glycoside hydrolase family 5. Based on substrate specificity and mode of action, cellulases are distinguished either as endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, or b-glucosidases [4,8]. Use of model cello-oligosaccharides and polysaccharides confirmed that the enzyme purified in the present study is a typical endoglucanase and similar to the endoglucanases characterized from other microorganisms [40­42]. Also, the use of CM-celluloses with varying viscosities and DS showed that the endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus is a randomly acting enzyme and that the DS rather than the viscosity of CM-cellulose has a significant influence on the action of this enzyme. Furthermore, the endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus was active on barley b-glucan (with random b, 1-3 b, 1-4 linkages) and lichenan (with repeating unit of b, 1-3 b, 1-4 b, 1-4 linkages), but

T. aurantiacus endoglucanase suggests that this enzyme possesses an extended substrate binding site. A similar substrate binding site has been found in the case of endoglucanases from T. reesei [47,48] and other microorganisms [43­46]. Also, the release of cellobiose and cellotriose as the main reaction products of cellopentaose by T. aurantiacus endoglucanase indicates its preference for internal glucosidic bonds. In addition, a rapid increase in Kcat with higher MeUmbGlcn confirmed its preference for longer Glcn . Further analysis of the data suggested that the endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus possesses at least five sugar binding sites, of which three form preferential binding sites for the sugar moieties. The size of the interaction energies for T. aurantiacus endoglucanase coincided with those reported for endoglucanase I from T. reesei [31]. The mode of action of this endoglucanase on unsubstituted and substituted Glcn was found to be similar, which is in agreement with the action of the endoglucanase I from T. reesei [40]. Claeyssens and Henrissat [42] performed a detailed specificity mapping of cellulolytic enzymes, which belong to glycoside hydrolase families 5­10 using chromophoric glycosides derived from D -glucose, cellobiose, higher Glcn , lactose, D -xylose, and b-(1,4)-xylobiose. Interestingly, the cellulolytic enzymes classified based on hydrophobic cluster analysis of amino acid sequences into different families showed a characteristic specificity pattern [42]. In fact, the specificity pattern observed for family 5 glycoside hydrolases [42] correlates well with the specificity and mode of action of endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus. Thus, both N-terminal sequence alignment and biochemical results strongly suggest that the endoglucanase from T. aurantiacus is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 5.
