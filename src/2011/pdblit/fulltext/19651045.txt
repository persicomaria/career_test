Abstract
Hemoglobins (Hbs) are important proteins devoted to oxygen transport. Hbs carry out their function by keeping the iron atom, which binds the oxygen molecule, in its reduced Fe(II) state. Nonetheless, it is well known that Hbs frequently undergo, even under physiological conditions, spontaneous oxidation. Although these processes have been widely investigated, their role and impact in different biological contexts are still highly debated. In vertebrate Hbs, assembled in a2b2 tetramers, it has traditionally been assumed that

oxidized forms endowed with nativelike structures are either aquo-met or hydroxy-met states, depending on the pH of the medium. This view has been questioned by several independent investigations. In the past, indirect evidence of the existence of alternative nativelike oxidized forms was obtained from spectroscopic analyses. Indeed, it was suggested that, in tetrameric Hbs, bis-histidyl hemichrome states could be compatible with folded structures. Recent studies performed by complementing spectroscopic and crystallographic methodologies have provided a detailed picture of hemichrome structure and formation in these proteins. Here we review the methodological approaches adopted to achieve these results, the main structural features of these states, and the current hypotheses on their possible functional implications.

1. Introduction
The autoxidation process in Hbs isolated from different organisms shows similarities and differences. The product of heme oxidation is dependent on many factors (e.g., globin matrix, pH, temperature, oxygen pressure, denaturant agents). In the Hb superfamily, the most common ferric form, as a product of autoxidation, is the exogenous hexacoordinated (6C) aquo-met in equilibrium with the hydroxy-met form, whose pKa depends on the globin matrix. However, a variety of coordination states have been detected and characterized. In fact, in addition to non-aquo exogenous coordination (e.g., FÀ, CNÀ, N3À), both pentacoordination (5C) and endogenous hexacoordination (hemichromes) states have been observed. Within the large Hb superfamily, the occurrence and relevance of these products is variable. The heme 5C coordination is relatively rare in Hb. This state has been initially reported for monomeric (Ilari et al., 2002) and dimeric (Boffi et al., 1994) Hbs, and more recently for Hbs with higher structural complexity, such as tetrameric Hbs from polar fish (Giordano et al., 2007; Vergara et al., 2007) and giant Hbs (Marmo Moreira et al., 2006). The occurrence of endogenous hexacoordination is more widespread. The specific endogenous coordination under native conditions depends on the distal residue, most frequently His (bis-His adduct, or His-hemichrome). More rarely, in Hbs with lower structural complexity (Milani et al., 2005) or in mutants of human Hb (HbA) (Nagai et al., 2000), Tyr has been found to act as the sixth ligand at the iron site. Because in tetrameric wild-type Hbs the proximal and distal residues are both His, in this chapter the only hemichrome states described are those formed by His residues. In initial analyses of hemichromes in tetrameric Hbs, the states were strictly associated with denaturation. More recent investigations have indicated that a hemichrome state may be considered a substate of the nativelike

Hb population. These states can be distinguished from those associated with denatured conditions by reversibility and the absence of precipitation and heme release (Rifkind et al., 1994). A detailed description of the hemichrome formation and denaturation, based on HbA experiments, has been previously reported (Rifkind et al., 1994). More recently, two new areas have emerged in this field: (1) new hypotheses on the physiological role of hemichrome and (2) the elucidation of Hb three-dimensional structures containing a bis-His adduct. The ferric forms of Hb are physiologically inert to further oxygenation, but several subsequent side reactions in the Hb autoxidation may interfere with or merge into other biochemical pathways, including the formation of a hemichrome. The relevance of this species spans from biomedical to physiological aspects. For example, autoxidation is a serious problem that limits the storage time of acellular Hb-based blood substitutes (Ray et al., 2002); also, hemichrome detection has been suggested as a valuable tool for tumor diagnosis (Croci et al., 2001). The reaction of acetylphenylhydrazine (APH) with erythrocytes leads to hemichrome formation in healthy people and not in breast-cancer patients (Croci et al., 2001). Some of these hypotheses were reviewed in Rifkind et al. (1994). The bis-His complex can be involved in ligand binding (de Sanctis et al., 2004a; Pesce et al., 2004), in the in vivo reduction of met-Hb, in Heinz body formation (Rifkind et al., 1994), and in nitric oxide scavenging. It has also been suggested that hemichrome can be involved in Hb protection from peroxidation attack (Feng et al., 2005). The hemichrome species of isolated human a subunits complexed with the a-helix stabilizing protein (AHSP) does not exhibit peroxidase activity (Feng et al., 2005).

2. Antarctic Fish Hemoglobins
Mammalian Hbs show a low level of hemichrome in physiological conditions at room temperature. In contrast, Antarctic fish Hbs are easily oxidized to hemichrome (Riccio et al., 2002; Vergara et al., 2007; Vitagliano et al., 2004). Compared to temperate and tropical fish, most species of the dominant Antarctic suborder Notothenioidei have evolved reduced erythrocyte numbers and Hb concentration and multiplicity (Everson and Ralph, 1968; Wells et al., 1980). The family Channichthyidae (the notothenioid crown group) is devoid of Hb (Ruud, 1954). Although a report in the literature (Sidell and O'Brien, 2006) challenges the ensuing hypothesis, we believe that the adaptive reduction in Hb content/multiplicity and erythrocyte numbers in the blood of Antarctic notothenioids counterbalances the increase in blood viscosity produced by subzero seawater temperature (Wells et al., 1990) with potentially negative

428

physiological effects (i.e., higher demand of energy needed for circulation). The oxygen affinity of the Hbs of many Antarctic species (which controls binding of oxygen at the exchange surface and release to the tissues) is quite low (di Prisco et al., 1988; Verde et al., 2006), as indicated by the values of p50 (the oxygen partial pressure required to achieve half saturation). This feature is probably linked to the high oxygen concentration in the cold Antarctic waters. The decreased oxygen affinity of Hb at the lowest pH values of the physiological range is known as the alkaline Bohr effect, reviewed in Riggs (1988). In many teleost fish, when the pH is lowered, the oxygen affinity of Hb decreases to such an extent that it cannot be fully saturated even at very high oxygen pressure. At low pH, cooperativity is totally lost and the oxygen capacity of blood undergoes reduction of 50% or more of the value measured at alkaline pH. This feature is known as the Root effect, reviewed in Brittain (2005). Most Antarctic fish Hbs display a strong Root effect (Verde et al., 2007). Current work in our laboratory, based on a combined electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)­crystallography approach, suggests a correlation between Root effect and hemichrome stability in Antarctic fish Hbs. To date, crystallographic structures of cold-adapted Hbs in canonical R and T states (Camardella et al., 1992; Ito et al., 1995; Mazzarella et al., 1999, 2006a, 2006b) have highlighted the classical conformation and high similarity with their mesophilic homologues. Cold adaptation of the oxygen-transport system in Antarctic fish seems to be based on evolutionary changes involving levels of biological organization higher than the structure of Hb. These include changes in the rate of Hb synthesis or in regulation by allosteric effectors, which affect the amount of oxygen transported in blood. These factors are currently believed to be more important for short-term response to environmental challenges than was previously believed.

3. Overview of the Combined Spectroscopic/ Crystallographic Approach to the Characterization of Hemichrome in Tetrameric Hbs
This chapter will focus on the methods to detect His-hemichrome in tetrameric Hbs by the combined spectroscopic/crystallographic approach, and provides data and information useful for its optimal use. In monomeric or homo-oligomeric Hbs, spectroscopic analysis clearly reveals heme states. However, in tetrameric a2b2 heterodimers, the distribution of ferric-heme states among molecules and between a and b subunits cannot be unambiguously assigned by spectroscopic analysis (unless

perturbative hybrid synthesis is conducted); thus, the three-dimensional structure is required. The history of the three-dimensional structure of hemichromes in members of the Hb superfamily is quite recent; the first crystal structure of a monomeric Hb dates to 1995, by Mitchell et al. (1995a). Only in 2002 was a structure of a tetrameric Hb in a hemichrome state reported (Riccio et al., 2002). Crystallographic studies on tetrameric Hbs (Riccio et al., 2002; Robinson et al., 2003; Vergara et al., 2007; Vitagliano et al., 2004) have provided a significant contribution (1) by showing that these Hbs tend to form partial hemichrome states (in a or b) and (2) by providing a clear assignment of the binding states of the individual chains within the tetramer. The correspondence of the protein features detected in solution and in the crystal state has been supported by Raman experiments performed in both states (unpublished results). The combination of high-resolution crystal structure and spectroscopic techniques finely tuned by heme structural modifications (EPR and Raman spectroscopy) provides new tools for identifying stereochemical parameters of hemichrome coordination. However, details of the quaternary structure and its compatibility with endogenous coordination are as yet a unique field of three-dimensional structural characterization. Methodological details of this investigation are reported in the following sections.

4. Hemichrome Formation and Detection
4.1. Hemichrome occurrence in Hbs
The occurrence of hemichrome is frequent in nonvertebrate (Weber and Vinogradov, 2001), monomeric, and dimeric (Milani et al., 2005) Hbs. Also, mammalian (human and mouse) monomeric neuroglobin and dimeric human cytoglobin (de Sanctis et al., 2004a), and the complex human a-subunit AHSP (Feng et al., 2005) have been described as forming bis-His adducts. In mammals, tetrameric Hbs forms hemichromes in a number of chemical conditions, classified by Rifkind et al. (1994) as nondisruptive and disruptive of the globin structure. Irreversible hemichrome formation is facilitated by subunit dissociation, Hb instability (e.g., in several abnormal HbA mutants reviewed in Rifkind et al. [1994] and Jeong et al. [1999]), addition of denaturants (e.g., dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide [Ajloo et al., 2002], APH [Croci et al., 2001]), and dehydration (Rifkind et al., 1994). Reversible hemichrome of HbA is obtained at low temperature (Rifkind et al., 1994; Svistunenko et al., 2000), at high oxygen pressure (Rifkind et al., 1994), or by oxygenation of NO adducts (Arnold et al., 1999). There is a strong, nonsystematic pH dependence of hemichrome

430

stability in monomeric Hb (Couture et al., 1999), dimeric Hb (Boffi et al., 1994), human HbA (Svistunenko et al., 2000), and Antarctic fish Hbs (unpublished results). Promising perspectives are linked to the ability to trap hemichromes of HbA and myoglobin (Mb) via thermal generation (15 min at 75 ) of trialose glass-encapsuled samples (Ray et al., 2002). It is interesting that Mb thin films provide hemichromes with efficient electron-transfer properties (Feng and Tachikawa, 2001). As an alternative encapsulation mechanism, hemichrome formation in the a subunits of horse aquo-met-Hb crystals is reported following a drop in pH to 5.4 (Robinson et al., 2003; see the section ``Crystallization'' herein).

4.2. The exceptional behavior of Antarctic fish Hbs
Within the realm of tetrameric Hbs, Antarctic fish Hbs are exceptions. Under native conditions, they quantitatively form hemichrome in the b subunits (Riccio et al., 2002; Vitagliano et al., 2004). However, the bisHis coordination in the ferrous state, called hemochrome (Rifkind et al., 1994), has never been observed. Thus, under reduction, the hemichrome species is reversibly converted to the classical pentacoordinated deoxy form (Vitagliano et al., 2004). In contrast, other monomeric or dimeric Hbs display bis-His coordination at the iron atom in both the ferric state and the ferrous state (Couture et al., 1999; Das et al., 1999; Sawai et al., 2005). As yet, there is no a clear understanding of the molecular forces that prevent hemochrome formation in the Antarctic fish Hbs. Approaches based on quantum mechanics that take into account the flexibility of the protein matrix have been developed (Amadei et al., 2005; Bikiel et al., 2006) for heme-containing models. These methodologies could be applied to investigate bis-His coordination. There are two protocols for obtaining the hemichrome in Trematomus bernacchii Hb (HbTb), both at neutral pH and at room temperature. One is based on exposure of the CO form to air for a few days, and the second on the ready oxidation by potassium ferricyanide of the CO form. The spectral properties and the crystal structures of these two forms of HbTb are the same (Vitagliano et al., 2004). However, extensive analysis of the major Hb of the Antarctic fish Trematomus newnesi (Hb1Tn) at different times of air exposure reveals that the b-heme coordination and geometry undergo extensive changes along air exposure from 3 h to a week or months (Riccio et al., 2002). When Antarctic fish Hbs are oxidized by ferricyanide, a large variety of ferric species (observed by EPR) are formed (Vergara et al., 2007), namely aquo-met, hydroxy-met, and two distinct hemichromes (see the section ``Atomic resolution structure of HbTb in a partial hemichrome state'' herein). As exceptions, the cathodic component of T. newnesi (HbCTn)

(Vergara et al., 2007) and Arctic Hb from Liparis tunicatus (unpublished) revealed a 5C ferric form even at physiological pH, possibly related to the substitution Val E11(b67) ! Ile. Preliminary spectroscopic studies on this Hb reveal an unligated ferric state (unpublished). The prominent high-spin signal corresponds to that of an aquo-met form. Probably, the replacement of Val E11(67b) with bulkier Ile in Liparis tunicatus Hb generates unfavorable interactions in the heme pocket, and thus negatively affects the bis-His adduct formation in the b chains (Vergara et al., 2007).

4.3. Spectroscopic markers
An optical spectrum of a hemichrome complex shows a peak at 535 and a shoulder at 565 nm, not superimposing the peaks of the aquo-met complex at around 500 and 631 nm. It is worth mentioning that hydroxy-met displays peaks at around 541 and 576 nm (Feis et al., 1994). Few Raman spectroscopy analyses are available for tetrameric Hbs in hemichrome state (Nagai et al., 2000; Verde et al., 2004), but there is abundant literature on cytochromes (Smulevich et al., 2005), truncated Hbs (Egawa and Yeh, 2004) and dimeric Hbs (Sawai et al., 2005). The Raman markers of hemichrome are the [n3] 1508, [n2] 1578, [n37] 1604, and [n10] 1638 cmÀ1 bands, which differ from those of aquo-met ([n3] 1478, [n38]1512, [n2] 1560, and [n37] 1578 cmÀ1) (Verde et al., 2004). Raman microscopy has been fulfilling a role in characterizing single protein crystals; it is a valuable tool for secondary-structure analysis and for following binding processes (Carey, 2006). In combination with X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic analysis, Raman microscopy is also valuable for bridging results from the solution to the crystal phase (Smulevich et al., 1990), which solves possible conflicts (Smulevich, 1998) between spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence. Studies on peroxidase are an example of how the combination of spectroscopic and crystallographic characterizations may strengthen conclusions (Marzocchi and Smulevich, 2003; Smulevich, 1998). As supporting evidence, we report the comparison between the solution and single-crystal Raman spectra of the ferric form of Hb1Tn (Fig. 24.1). The similarity of the two spectra extends to every band of the spectrum, except for the scattering assigned to the vinyl groups, which gives rise to two bands (nC ¼ C) in the solution state at 1620 and 1629 cmÀ1, respectively, and to only one in the crystal phase at 1620 cmÀ1 (unpublished). Extensive correlation between nC ¼ C and orientation of the vinyl group in respect to the heme plane is available (Marzocchi and Smulevich, 2003). EPR spectroscopy is a long-standing approach to the analysis of hemichromes (Blumberg and Peisach, 1972). The low-spin (S ¼ 1/2) ferric hemichrome is EPR active and exhibits signals that differ from those of

high-spin 5C and aquo-met forms and from those of low-spin hydroxy-met complexes. The theory of the EPR band shape for low-spin ferric forms has been reported (Palmer, 1985). Depending on the charge state of His side chains and the geometry of bis-His coordination, the g anisotropy of hemichrome signals may vary (Walker, 2004; Walker et al., 1984). According to the Blumberg and Peisach (1972) classification of the g values in different groups, hemichromes belong to class B, with gmax from 3.0 to 3.4, and gmid from 2.1 to 2.3. Pulsed techniques have been applied to investigate hemichromes from members of the Hb superfamily (Ioanitescu et al., 2005), providing another valuable tool to obtain stereochemical parameters of bis-His coordination. EPR data have been compared to the structural data of many model compounds (Walker, 2004; Walker et al., 1984). However, the increasing number of crystal structures of Hbs in hemichrome state has allowed for correlating g anisotropy and heme stereochemistry (see the section ``Atomic resolution structure of HbTb in a partial hemichrome state'' herein). Reversible hemichrome formation (Vitagliano et al., 2004) and reduction (Weiland et al., 2004) have also been investigated. It is interesting that in monomeric Hbs the reduction kinetics of hemichromes is faster than that of pentacoordinated unligated states.

433

In HbA, the a chains are oxidized faster than the b chains (Tsuruga et al., 1998) and the hemichrome formation passes through the aquo-met form (Rachmilewitz et al., 1971). Hemichrome formation of Antarctic fish HbTb has been studied by optical spectroscopy (Vitagliano et al., 2004), as shown in Fig. 24.2. In the starting CO form, the Soret band occurs at 418 nm and the Q bands at 538 and 567 nm. Upon air exposure, the spectrum begins to change. First, the Soret band broadens and blue-shifts to 414 nm, and the Q band red-shifts to 575 nm, indicating formation of an oxy form. Subsequently, a weak shoulder at 630 nm (corresponding to the charge transfer band of a hexacoordinated high-spin aquo-met form) becomes evident; the Soret band downshifts further to 407 nm, and the Q bands broaden, shifting to 530 and 565 nm. Preliminary results of hemichrome formation in Hb1Tn have also been obtained by Raman spectroscopy in solution and in the crystal phase. The n4 band, very sensitive to the oxidation state, reveals an intermediate species, intermediate between the initial ferrous (1353 cmÀ1) and the final aquomet/hemichrome form (1372 cmÀ1). Hemichrome formation, studied by X-ray crystallography, identifies this intermediate as a ferric unligated 5C species (unpublished).

5. Structural Characterization of Hemichrome in Tetrameric Hbs
The first crystallographic characterization of tetrameric Hb in hemichrome state was reported for Hb1Tn (Riccio et al., 2002). Subsequent studies described hemichrome structures in horse Hb (Robinson et al., 2003) and in HbTb (Vergara et al., 2007; Vitagliano et al., 2004). The hemichromes of Hb1Tn, HbTb, and horse Hb were obtained and crystallized under remarkably different conditions.

5.1. Crystallization
Crystallization of Hb1Tn hemichrome was undertaken on the basis of UV-visible spectra in solution (Riccio et al., 2001), which suggested the presence of a significantly populated hemichrome species along the oxidation pathway of the protein. Because at that time there was no evidence of the folded state of these species, initial crystallization attempts were performed on air-exposed samples. Despite the presence of a multitude of different forms, as suggested by the spectra, well-shaped crystals were obtained using monomethyl polyethylene glycol 5,000 as a precipitant in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The crystals displayed a diffraction pattern characteristic of well-ordered crystals (Riccio et al., 2001). The indexing of the diffraction spot surprisingly showed that the crystals were isomorphous to those of the carbonmonoxy form (Mazzarella et al., 1999), grown under completely different conditions (2.0 ammonium sulfate, 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0). Even more surprising, the electron density maps showed the presence of a bis-histidyl adduct at the b iron heme. An exogenous ligand, initially identified as a CO molecule (successively assigned as a mixture of CO/O2/aquo-met forms present in the crystal state), was present at the a iron (Riccio et al., 2002). These data provided the first direct evidence that a partial hemichrome state, associated to the b subunits, was compatible with a well-defined three-dimensional structure of the protein. Therefore, a similar crystal packing, obtained under completely different conditions, can allocate two different Hb1Tn structures, namely the carbomonoxy and the partial hemichrome, that exhibit significant structural differences at quaternary-structure level (see the subsequent section for details). These results prompted further investigations, both in solution and in the crystal state, on other Antarctic fish Hbs. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analyses were obtained with HbTb (Vitagliano et al., 2004), closely related to Hb1Tn. In addition to crystallization of the air-exposed protein, a second strategy was adopted in this case. Crystallization was also attempted on fully oxidized HbTb obtained with sodium ferricyanide (see the previous section).

Characterization of bis-Histidyl Adducts in Tetrameric Hbs

Diffracting crystals were obtained using either air-exposed or ferricyanidetreated HbTb. As for Hb1Tn, a bis-histidyl adduct was formed only at the b iron. In contrast, the a iron was in aquo/hydroxy-met state. The characterization of the horse Hb hemichrome state was accomplished under totally different conditions (Robinson et al., 2003). These studies were based on the observation (Perutz, 1954) that crystalline horse met-Hb undergoes a large lattice transition as pH is decreased from 7.1 to 5.4. Analysis of the crystals grown at neutral pH showed that both a and b iron adopted a standard aquo-met state. However, the decrease of pH to 5.4 produced a transition of the a iron to a hemichrome state. No variation was detected for the b iron, which maintained its aquo-met state. Like Antarctic fish Hb, horse Hb is able to form a partial hemichrome with a nativelike structure. Notably, in these two proteins, the chain that forms the bishistidyl complex is different. It is not known whether this puzzling behavior is dictated by intrinsic differences of the individual chains, by differences in the tetramer flexibility, or by different conditions of hemichrome formation. It is worth mentioning that, in both cases, only partial hemichrome states were observed. This may suggest that tetrameric Hbs retain their native structure only in states with a single-chain type in the hemichrome state. Although data available are still limited, it can be proposed that the simultaneous formation of bis-histidyl adducts in all chains of the tetramer has strong disturbing effects on the structure of these Hbs.

5.2. The available three-dimensional structural models
Comparative analysis of the structural alterations induced by hemichrome formation in horse and Antarctic fish Hbs reveals differences and analogies. In all cases, a scissoring motion of the EF fragment of the chain that forms the bis-histidyl complexes is observed (Fig. 24.3). This is an expected rearrangement of the globin structure required for the coordination of distal His to the iron atom. It is worth mentioning that this distortion of the tertiary structure is costly from an energetic point of view. Indeed, if the distance between the Ca atoms of distal and proximal His is taken to estimate the entity of the structural variation (Fig. 24.4), it appears that the structural alteration associated with hemichrome formation is much larger than that exhibited by liganded/unliganded tetrameric Hbs in different packing contexts. It is interesting that in horse Hb, HbTb, and Hb1Tn, the modifications of the EF fragment are associated with a similar sliding of the heme that becomes more exposed to the solvent (Fig. 24.5). On the basis of this observation, it has been proposed that the hemichrome formation facilitates the involvement of the heme in electron-transfer processes (Robinson et al., 2003), which suggests possible functional roles of the native-like hemichrome structures.

A strikingly different behavior is displayed by the quaternary-structure variations of mammalian and Antarctic fish Hbs upon hemichrome formation. Although the changes observed in horse Hb are limited to the tertiary structure, the overall structure of Antarctic fish Hbs exhibits significant variations. Indeed, a rotation of about 4 to 5 of the a1b1 dimer relative

438

Alessandro Vergara et al.

to the a2b2 dimer is observed when the structure of the partial hemichrome state is compared to that of the carbomonoxy form. It is interesting that the modification of the quaternary structure observed upon hemichrome formation falls in the physiological conformational transition between liganded (R) and unliganded (T) states of tetrameric Hbs (Fig. 24.6). This similarity of structural variations associated to Hb oxidations and those linked to oxygen release suggests that this protein uses the same conformational switch in different scenarios and is possibly involved in the T ! R transition. In principle, the differences observed between horse Hb and Hb1Tn/ HbTb could be ascribed either to a higher intrinsic flexibility of Antarctic fish Hbs or to the peculiar crystalline environment in which the horse Hb hemichrome was formed. It should be noted, however, that studies in solution show that Antarctic fish Hbs clearly show a natural tendency to form bis-His (Vitagliano et al., 2004). Hypotheses on the regions responsible for this distinctive behavior of Antarctic fish Hbs have been proposed (Riccio et al., 2002). In particular, the higher flexibility of these Hbs has been related to the CD and the EF corner of the b chain.

Initial data collections on crystals of tetrameric Hbs in hemichrome state were collected using standard rotating-anode X-ray generators. Synchrotron radiation has been successfully used to increase the resolution of the

The b1 chain of HbTbCO (light gray), HbTbdeoxy (black), and HbTb in partial hemichrome state (dark gray) have been superimposed.The differences in the orientation of the a chains indicate that the quaternary structure of the partial hemichrome state is intermediate between the R andTstates.

data and to provide more accurate structures. Although structure analyses carried out using synchrotron data have mostly confirmed previous results, this study provided a detailed picture of the iron coordination (Fig. 24.7). This information has been used to assign plausible structures to the two HbTb hemichromes detected in solution by EPR. A recent analysis, based on the 11 crystal structures of Hb in hemichrome states, led to conclusions that the two most relevant stereochemical parameters in tuning the g anisotropy are the tilt angle between the heme plane and the imidazole plane of distal His, yd, and the dihedral angle between the two imidazole planes, o (Vergara et al., 2007). Indeed, following procedures previously adopted for cytochromes and using available literature data, correlation between EPR signals and iron coordination geometry of hemichrome adducts in Hb structures has been established. In general, two different classes, corresponding to either ideal or distorted iron coordination states, have been identified. The analysis of the high-resolution HbTb hemichrome structure clearly indicates that the adduct falls among distorted hemichromes. As a result, it has been inferred that the other HbTb hemichrome is endowed with the ideal geometry of iron coordination.

6. Conclusions
The past decade provided 11 independent crystal structures of Hbs in bis-His coordination (de Sanctis et al., 2004b, 2005; Feng et al., 2005; Hargrove et al., 2000; Hoy et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 1995b; Pesce, 2003; Riccio et al., 2002; Robinson et al., 2003; Vallone et al., 2004; Vitagliano et al., 2004). The stereochemical details of high-resolution crystal structure highlighted several correlations between spectroscopic properties in solution, theoretical predictions, and experimental structures. The most recent results stressed the Raman and EPR efficiency in predicting structural details. Raman analysis seems to provide a valuable bridge for solving possible discrepancies between solution- and crystal-derived information. The occurrence of hemichrome/hemochrome in members of the Hb superfamily is not uniform. Together with different stability conditions, these findings suggest that the functional role of the bis-His coordination is not singular, and that it is possibly a tool for modulating ligand-binding or redox properties. In Antarctic fish Hbs, it is still disputed whether hemichromes have a biological function or are merely an evolutionary memory.
