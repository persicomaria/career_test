The alternatively spliced type III extradomain B (EIIIB) of fibronectin (FN) is expressed only during embryogenesis, wound healing and tumorigenesis. The biological function of this domain is unclear. We describe here the first crystal structure of the interface between alternatively spliced EIIIB and its adjacent FN type III domain 8 (FN B-8). The opened CC loop of EIIIB, and the rotation and tilt of EIIIB allow good access to the FG loop of FN-8, which is normally hindered by the CC loop of FN-7. In addition, the AGEGIP sequence of the CC loop of EIIIB replaces the NGQQGN sequence of the CC loop of FN-7. Finally, the CC loop of EIIIB forms an acidic groove with FN-8. These structural findings warrant future studies directed at identifying potential binding partners for FN B8 interface, linking EIIIB to skeletal and cartilaginous development, wound healing, and tumorigenesis, respectively.

Fibronectin (FN) is a multifunctional protein serving major roles in the adhesion, migration, differentiation and proliferation of cells with implications in embryonic development, wound healing, and tumorigenesis.1 The significance of FN in embryonic development has been documented by the embryonic lethality seen in mice when the FN gene is disrupted.2 FN is a high molecular mass

dimeric glycoprotein with disulfide-linked subunits, each with a molecular mass of approximately 220­ 250 kDa. FN interacts with several other proteins in the extracellular matrix, including collagen, heparin, fibrin, and cell membrane receptors. The amino acid composition of FN reveals it to be a large modular glycoprotein composed of homologous repeats of three prototypical types of domains known as types I, II and III.3 Of these domains, FN type III (FN-III) repeats are composed of  90 amino acid residues, making them the largest and most common of the FN subdomains.4 One of the best-characterized interactions between FN and cell membrane recep-

305 the tilt between type III domains 7 to 10 of FN varies with the maximum tilt (52°) between domains 7 and 8. There is unfortunately no general rule in the orientations between adjacent domains. EIIIB insertion between type III domains 7 and 8 undoubtedly alters the interface, and possibly the overall molecular polarity as a consequence of domain flips. As a consequence of the insertion of EIIIB between type III domains 7 and 8, it was hypothesized that these structural conformational changes of fibronectin would alter its interactions with other proteins, thereby modulating extracellular signaling cascades in embryogenesis, wound healing, and neovascularization. To understand the role of EIIIB insertion and the interface between FN type III domain extra domain B (EIIIB) and domain 8 (FN-8), we solved a 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of the FN-III fragment of EIIIB and FN-8. The structure reveals a unique interdomain relationship and provides structural insights into possible biological roles of EIIIB. The overall structure of FN-B8 We initially attempted to crystallize the recombinant fragment of FN-III domain 7 (FN-7), EIIIB, and FN-8 (the primary structure is shown in Figure 1(a)). However, the crystals were too small and failed to yield sufficient X-ray diffraction. Since the FN 7-10 structure is known,4 we changed our strategy to make two shorter constructs; FN 7-B (FN-7 and EIIIB), and FN B-8 (EIIIB and FN-8). FN 7-B grew very small, needle-like crystals that failed to yield sufficient X-ray diffraction. On the other hand, the FN B-8 fragment crystallized readily in 10­15% (w/v) PEG-3350, 0.15­0.2 mM diammonium citrate ((NH4)2HC6H5O7)) and the crystals diffracted well. The crystal structure of FN B-8 was determined by molecular replacement of previously solved FN-8 (RSCB code 1fnf). The structure was refined to 2.01 Å (Table 1) with R = 24.9% and Rfree = 30.1% (Figure 1(a)­(c)). We were unable to trace completely the N-terminal histidine tag and several amino acid residues thereafter. This highly flexible N-terminal portion may contribute to slightly increased R values. However, these refinement statistic values are mimicking those of the 2.0 Å crystal structure of type III fibronectin solved previously.4 FN B-8 appears to be a monomeric structure in one crystallographic asymmetric unit. Like other crystal structures in the fibronectin family, the overall structure of FN B-8 is composed of two copies of  sandwich globular domains (Figure 1(b)). Each  sandwich domain is formed by an intimate antiparallel embrace of three anti-parallel -strands

Among the type III domains of FN that span the central part of the FN molecule, three regions referred to as EIIIA, EIIIB and IIICS, respectively, are subject to alternative splicing of a primary transcript.3­11 Of these spliced domains, EIIIA and EIIIB are either included or excluded by exon skipping and their alternative splicing is regulated in a tissue-specific and developmental stage-dependent manner. 11,12 The amino acid sequence of alternatively spliced exons EIIIA and EIIIB is well conserved, suggesting their functional importance.13 Initial studies showed EIIIA and EIIIB splice variants of FN expressed prominently around developing blood vessels during embryonic development.14,15 These splice variants are absent from normal adult tissues, except during wound healing and neoplastic vascularization. However, EIIIB-null and EIIIA-null mice develop normally with only some small differences in wound healing, atherosclerosis and life-span in the EIIIA-null mice.13 Fibroblasts cultured from EIIIB-null mice grow slowly in vitro and deposit less FN in the pericellular matrix compared to fibroblasts cultured from wildtype mice.12 EIIIB expression is found predominantly in breast and colorectal carcinomas. It was believed that tumor cells express EIIIB FN to recruit endothelial cells in order to supply the tumor mass with oxygen and nutrients. Thus, EIIIB may be one of a few clinical markers of neovascularization.16 Antibodies and variations of recombinant antibodies against EIIIB were proposed to be used in detection and treatment of several tumors, including oral and mammary carcinomas.17,18 The primary structure and electromicrographs suggested that FN-III is an extended molecule composed of repeated sequence motifs described as "beads on a string".19,20 The crystal structure of FN type III domains 7 to 10 (FN7-10) that includes the RGD loop in domain 10 and the PHSRN synergy site in domain 9 has been published.4 The structure of FN-EIIIB alone has been solved by NMR.21 The individual FN type-III domains are very similar to each other, and each domain consists of two  strands, one of four strands (G, F, C and C) and one of three strands (A, B, and E).4 The domains in FNIII have a low level of sequence identity (approximately 30% or lower), but they all have highly conserved secondary structural frameworks.4,21 The major variable factor between each FN-III domain is the interdomain interface, which appears to be specific to each domain pair.4 It is of interest that the interdomain buried surface area between type III domains 7 to 10 varies, and the maximum buried surface area is between domains 7 and 8.4 Similarly,

Fibronectin Type III Domain-mediated Signaling

The overall fold of FN-8 is similar to that of the previous crystal structure (rmsd = 4.2 Å; Figure 1(d)). The only obvious change in our FN-8 structure is the formation of an extra -G strand. While this alteration is possibly caused by crystal packing, it is clear that the additional extra domain B has little effect on the overall structural arrangement of FN-8. FN-B structurally alters the macromolecular structure of fibronectin We further compared our EIIIB structure with that of the previously solved FN-7. As expected, the overall frameworks of EIIIB and FN-7 are very similar (rmsd = 3.3 Å). The only noticeable alteration in the structural framework is that the -E strand of EIIIB seems to be longer and more structured than that of FN-7 (Figure 2(a)). While the general architectures of EIIIB and FN-7 are alike, the interactions between FN-7 and FN-8 are distinctively different from those of EIIIB and FN-8. When we superimposed FN-8 of our structure and FN-8 of the 1fnf structure, we discovered three distinctions between the FN-7/FN-8 and FN-B/FN-8 structures (Figure 2(a)). First, the bending angle between EIIIB and FN-8 in our structure appears to be approximately 63°, or about 11° more than the angle between FN-7 and FN-8 (previously reported as 52°).4 Secondly, the rotating angle between EIIIB and FN-8 is approximately 117°, or about 5° different from that between FN-7 and FN-8 (previously reported as 112°).4 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the locations and conformations of the AB, CC, and EF loops of FN-B are different from those of FN-7. FN-B and FN-8 interface The location and conformation of EF loops are the most conserved among other loops in the interface. The more acute bending of loop AB in domain B allows the dimer to bend further, which coincides with the rotation of domain B and the opening of loop CC. The interdomain linker between EIIIB and FN-8 buries 416 Å2 of surface area, while the interdomain linker between FN-7 and FN-8 buries 587 Å2 of surface area. The insertion of EIIIB clearly opens up the buried surface over 170 Å2. The buried interface of EIIIB and FN-8 (416 Å2) is also less than that between FN-8 and FN-9 (527 Å2), but more than that between FN-9 and FN-10 (333 Å2). Therefore, the interface of EIIIB and FN-8 is the second smallest buried interface among the known FN-III interdomain interfaces. The smallest FN-III buried interface belonging to FN-9 and FN-10 is believed to allow the RGD sequence of FN-10 and the synergy sequence (PHSRN) of FN-9 to function together in the interaction with integrin.4,7 This alteration in the buried interface and the size of the FN B-8 interface suggest that it is possible that loop CC between the interface of EIIIB and FN-8 may behave like the RGD of FN-10 and the synergy region of FN-9. We further examined the electrostatic potential surface of FN B-8 (Figure 2(b)). The CC loop of EIIIB

Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. A recombinant fragment of human type III fibronectin FN-B and FN-8 (FN-B8) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pET15b expression vector. The protein was expressed and purified as described.4,25 FN-B8 was concentrated to 6 mg ml- 1 in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), and crystallized using the sittingdrop, vapor-diffusion method at 22 °C. Crystals of 200­300 m in size grew in 10% (w/v) PEG-3350, 0.15­0.2 mM diammonium citrate ((NH4)2HC6H5O7). The crystals were cryo-protected in 30­ 40% (v/v) glycerol plus 60­70% (v/v) mother liquor before flashfreezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the X-ray Facility at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. The experiments were performed at 100 K using cryo-cooled crystals, and were processed and reduced using DENZO, SCALEPACK, and HKL2000.26 The FN-B8 structure was determined by molecular replacement (AMoRe)27 using the structure of FN-8 (RBSC code 1fn1)4 as a search model. Residues 87­274 (188 residues) of the 223 residues were traced. Structures were refined using torsion angle dynamics in CNS,28 with the maximum likelihood function target, and included an overall anisotropic Bfactor and a bulk solvent correction. About 10% of the observed data were set aside for cross-validation using Rfree before any refinement. Manual adjustments were performed using the program O29 and A-weighted30 electron density maps. Simulated annealing omit and A-weighted difference density maps were used. Final structures exhibit good geometry with no Ramachandran outlier. Molecular graphic Figures were created with MOLSCRIPT,31 BobScript,32 Raster3D,33 and Pymol [http://www.pymol.org]. a Rsym = |I­<I>|/I, where I is the observed intensity and <I> is the average intensity of multiple symmetry-related observations of that reflection. b Rcryst = | Fobs|­|Fcalc| /|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc | | are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. c Rfree = | Fobs|­|Fcalc| /|Fobs| for 10% of the data not | | used at any stage of structural refinement.

(A, B, and E) on one side, and four anti-parallel -strands (C, C, F, and G) on the opposite side. The general framework of EIIIB is almost identical with the NMR structure of FN-B (RSCB code 2fnb; Figure 1(d)).21 Compared to the NMR structure, however, the crystal structure showed clearly the formation of longer anti-parallel -strands. The rmsd between the C positions of our crystal structure and the NMR structure is as close as 2.5 Å. This allows us to validate our phasing information, since we did not use the NMR structure for our molecular replacement. We believe that the molecular arrangement and packing of the crystal may contribute to the tight  strand to  strand relationship in our structure compared to that in the NMR structure.

(a) Superimposition of EIIIB-8 of FN B-8 structure (shown in yellow/ red) with FN 7­8 previously solved, RSBC code 1fn1 (shown in green), demonstrates that the differences in torsion and bending angles of FN B-8 compared with the FN 7­8; and the conformational differences of the AB, EF, and CC loops in EIIIB and FN-7. The two orientations are related by a rotation of 180°.

308 forms an acidic groove with FN-8. In addition, The AGEGIP sequence of the CC loop of EIIIB is distinct from the NGQQGN sequence of the CC loop of FN-7 (Figure 1(a)). An equivalent acidic groove, formed by loop CC and its adjacent domain was identified in another FN-III-like structure, the FN-III domains of the cytoplasmic tail of integrin 4.22 The sizes of these two homologous acidic grooves are almost the same, approximately 20 Å × 10 Å. The acidic groove and loop CC were proposed to be potential protein­ protein interacting sites.22 We found that the neighboring molecule in the crystal structure packs nicely into this acidic groove. The opened CC loop of EIIIB and the rotation and tilt of EIIIB domain allow good access to the FG loop of FN-8, which is normally hindered by the CC loop of FN-7 (Figure 2(a)). Defining the potential protein-binding site We have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the FN type III domains EIIIB and 8, and compared it with the known structure of FN type III domains 7 and 8. It is of interest to consider the buried interdomain interface between EIIIB and FN8, and its comparison to that of FN-7 and FN-8. Our crystal structure of FN B-8 shows that the interface between EIIIB and FN-8 is the second smallest of the known FN-III structures and the CC loop of EIIIB forms a unique acidic groove with FN-8. The groove is large enough to allow the neighboring molecule in the crystal to pack. In addition, the bending angle between EIIIB and FN-8 in our structure appears to be tilted about 11° more than the angle between FN-7 and FN-8. The rotating angle between EIIIB and FN8 is also approximately 5° different from that between FN-7 and FN-8. Given the rotation angles between the various type-III domains of FN (7­10) and the biological significance attached to it (e.g. RGD and PHSRN loops in domains 10 and 9, respectively), it was speculated that insertion of EIIIB between domains 7 and 8 could alter the downstream structure by causing the domains to be flipped. Our data suggest that insertion of EIIIB may not have any downstream effect with respect to alteration of domain polarity. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the locations and conformations of loops AB, CC, and EF of FN-B are different from those of FN-7. Proposed potential protein-binding site Although the expression of spliced domain EIIIB is highly regulated during embryonic development, wound healing and tumorigenesis, there is no welldefined function for this spliced domain of FN. Interestingly, even the EIIIB-null mice fail to reveal a clear function for domain EIIIB, although embryonic fibroblasts prepared from the EIIIB­/­ mice showed slower proliferation and the FN fibrils assembled by these embryonic fibroblasts were shorter and thinner compared to those deposited by the wild-type fibroblasts.12 These findings suggest that FN EIIIB may play a specific role in the regulation of particular matrix assembly and FN matrix-dependent cell

growth. It has been shown that EIIIB-containing FN produced by cultured chondrocytes is incorporated preferentially in the cartilage matrix. EIIIB+FN has been described in the walls of smaller blood vessels, in the smooth muscle of the gastro-intestinal and respiratory tracts, and in cartilaginous structures.15 FN is known to utilize short-peptide surface loops in engaging its interactions with other proteins in the signaling pathway; for example, the RDG sequence of FN-10,6 the PHSRN sequence of FN-9,23 and the KNEED sequence of FN-8.24 On the basis of our crystal structure, it is tempting to speculate that the AGEGIP sequence of loop CC of EIIIB may be a potential site for protein binding. However, there is no evidence at present that AGEGIP is the proteinbinding site and studies are in progress to examine this potential binding site. Preliminary analysis of cell lysates showed several proteins (data not shown) binding to FN 7-EIIIB-8 and not FN 7­8 in a reproducible manner (affinity chromatography and 2D gel analysis). Further characterization of proteins binding to the FN 7-EIIIB-8 is in progress.
