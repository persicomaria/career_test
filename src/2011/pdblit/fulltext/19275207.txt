The design and synthesis of biotin chain-terminated inhibitors (BTI) showing high affinity for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) on one side and high affinity for avidin through the biotinylated tag on the other are reported. The affinity of the designed BTI toward five different MMPs has been evaluated and the simultaneous formation of a highly stable ternary system Avidin-BTI-MMP clearly assessed. This system will permit the development of new approaches to detect, quantify, or collect MMPs in biological samples, with potential applications in vivo.

INTRODUCTION The design of molecular probes able to selectively bind biomolecular targets is gaining importance not only for their applications in molecular biology, but also for the development of new techniques for the early stage diagnosis and therapy of several pathologies (1). Rational drug design driven by structural data is currently applied to speed up the design of new candidate drugs in pharmaceutical research (2-5). The same approach is even more important to design molecular probes where, besides classical requirements, additive structural and functional features are required. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), also known as matrixins, are proteinases that participate in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation (6) and in several extracellular processes (7-10). Under normal physiological conditions, the activity of MMPs is strictly regulated by transcription/activation of zymogens precursors, interaction with specific ECM components, and inhibition by endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) (11-14). An imbalance of these activities may results in diseases such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or heart failure (15, 16). As a matter of fact, expression and activation of MMPs are increased in these pathologies, as well as in almost all human cancers, compared to physiological conditions (17). Indeed, ECM degradation by MMPs does promote tumor invasiveness. Furthermore, it has been recently demonstrated that MMPs carry out functions other than promotion of invasion, and that they likely take part in the development of cancer even before invasion. Noteworthy, the degree of overexpression of MMPs in cancer tissues is strictly associated with the level of tumor invasiveness and with its tendency to form metastasis. It is therefore apparent that the development of efficient molecular devices designed to reveal the overexpression of MMPs may be a powerful tool for the early detection of tumors and the assessment of their aggressiveness, as well as of cardiocirculatory problems (18).

Studies focused on the detection of overexpression of MMPs have already been reported (19) and probes to profile MMPs in tissues synthesized and tested (20, 21). In particular, hydrolyzable, near-infrared fluorescent molecules have been successfully tested in mice to detect fibrosarcoma (22). Unfortunately, this innovative technique suffers from the serious limitation represented by the limited penetration of light (a few millimeters); such a degree of penetration is only sufficient for the readout of superficial subcutaneous tumors (<10 mm). An interesting approach to detect overexpression of MMP in atherosclerosis has also been published. Low molecular weight inhibitors, able to interact with the active site of MMPs involved in atherosclerotic plaque disruption, have been targeted with nuclear agents and tested in vivo (23-25). Although the results reported were extremely encouraging, the approach presented a scarce flexibility, due to experimental difficulties in preparing the targeted inhibitors and to limited availability of suitable nuclear agents. A significant improvement in the development of MMPconjugated probes to detect pathological events may be the rational design of biotin-labeled inhibitors (26), capable of binding to MMPs exclusively and with high affinity. These tagged molecules rely on the well-known avidin-biotin molecular recognition system and could be used in conjunction with commercially available biotin-labeled probes (i.e., radionuclide chelates) to efficiently detect pathological tissues by imaging the local overexpression of MMPs. The use of such molecules is not limited to in vivo imaging but can be extended to in vitro applications such as MMP purification by using avidin columns or devices. Capitalizing on our expertise on expression and structural characterization of MMPs (27-29) and on the rational design and synthesis of MMP inhibitors (30-35), in the present paper we report the design and synthesis of carboxylic-containing, biotinylated inhibitors able to show high affinity for MMPs and at the same time able to strongly interact with avidin through the biotinylated tag. In clinical therapy, selectivity of inhibitors for a specific MMP is dramatically important, so much so that the lack of selectivity is believed to have been the main reason for failures of clinical trials in the past. Often, the failure of clinical trials, due to the severity of the side-effects, was related to the chronic adverse

effects of nonselective inhibitors. On the other hand, for the molecules proposed here, selectivity is not an issue as chronic use is not required. Indeed, ideal probes to detect overexpression of MMPs must not be selective inhibitors vs a specific MMP, but they should instead selectively recognize MMPs among other proteins. These new biotinylated molecules designed to bind to MMPs and to be recognized by avidin might therefore be successfully used in the in vitro collection/purification of MMPs, in the visualization of pathological tissues where MMPs are overexpressed, and to evaluate the aggressiveness of the pathology by monitoring, e.g., radioactivity. Moreover, it might be possible to test in vivo the efficacy of clinical treatments against a specific disease by just monitoring the level of MMPs produced during the therapy. In addition, such molecules can be easily employed for collecting and purifying MMPs from biological samples.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
General. All reagents were commercially available and used as received. Dry solvents were prepared before use. The catalytic domain of the MMP-12 (G106-G263) was cloned into the pET21a (Novagen) using the restriction enzymes Nde I and Xho I (New England BioLabs). NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Gemini 200, Varian Mercury 400 spectrometer, and a Brucker 700 spectrometer (HSQC). HPLC purification was performed using Althech Ultrasphere C-18 column (250 × 10 mm) and monitored with a Dionex photodiode array detector. SPR data were obtained using a BioRad ProteOn XPR36.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Aryl-sulfonamide derivatives have been largely exploited to synthesize broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors. These scaffolds present different positions which can be easily functionalized by introducing new functional groups. This feature and their easy synthetic accessibility make sulfonamide derivatives suitable candidates to design biotin-tagged probes for MMPs. As zinc binding groups (ZBG), the carboxylic acid was selected despite its relatively weak affinity for the metal ion (36-38). The choice of a carboxylic acid to replace the most commonly used hydroxamic acid warrants higher stability of the inhibitor under physiological conditions (39) and provides better bioavailability (40).

In all MMPs, the flexibility of the protein loops forming the active site makes these enzymes able to modify the shape of the catalytic pocket to accommodate ligands with different structures (41-44). In particular, analyzing the structures available on the protein data bank, it is apparent that the volume of the S1 cavity can be changed to host ligands bearing lipophilic groups of different size. However, in MMP-1 and MMP-7 the S1 cavity is narrow as well as short "trucked" (MMP-7) such that bulky groups generally do not fit. Therefore, in order to probe all members of the MMP family, two scaffolds, bearing either a linear biphenyl moiety or a shorter methoxyphenyl group, were considered as possible bases for the synthesis of BTIs. Among all the scaffolds evaluated, molecules 1 and 2 (Figure 1) were selected for their low Ki values against five different MMPs (see Table 1). Noteworthy, the two scaffolds exhibit a sizably different selectivity and affinity for the MMPs chosen. In particular, inhibitor 1, due to the presence of a biphenyl moiety on the sulfonamide sulfur, showed inhibition constants in the nanomolar range. Only for MMP-1 and MMP-7 was the affinity in the low-micromolar range due to the relatively slim size of the S1 pocket (45). Although still good, 2 is a weaker MMP inhibitor with micromolar values of Ki for all the MMPs tested. Matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12) performs proteolysis of several ECM components including elastin, laminin, and type IV collagen. The stability of the active MMP-12 catalytic domain in the presence of weak inhibitors, the relatively large S1 pockets, and the high yield of the 15N-enriched protein in minimal medium make this enzyme an ideal model to evaluate BTI candidates. To explore the binding mode of the two scaffolds and to properly design the biotin tag derivatives, the two inhibitors were soaked in crystals of MMP-12 and the structure of the complexes solved by X-ray crystallography. Analysis of the crystal structures (see Figure 2) revealed that the inhibitors share a similar binding mode, with the catalytic zinc ion coordinated by the oxygens of the free carboxylate, the sulfonyl oxygen H-bonded with the NH of the Ala 182, and the liphophilic

groups nested inside the S1 pocket. The structural analysis accounts for the larger affinity of 1 for MMP-12 with respect to scaffold 2, as observed in the enzymatic assays. Indeed, in the MMP-12-1 complex, larger hydrophobic interactions result from the larger surface-to-surface contact area due to the presence of the biphenyl moiety. More important for the biotin tag inhibitor design was the solvent exposure of the sulfonamide nitrogen revealed by the crystal structures for both ligands. These structural data address the question related to the identification of the position where the tag can be inserted without spoiling the binding affinity. A further critical point in developing efficient biotinylated probes for in vivo and in vitro applications is represented by the choice of a suitable linker able to prevent any steric clashes between avidin and the target biomolecule. While a too-short spacer may impair the ability of the probe to bind both MMP and avidin, the use of a too-long spacer could affect the bioavailability, stability, and solubility of the whole molecule.

In particular, a too-long linker can increase the susceptibility of the probe to be split by enzymes such as the biotinidase that can degrade the molecule in vivo (46). Once more, the availability of the three-dimensional structure of both avidin-biotin complex (present in protein data bank, PDB code: 2avi) and 1-MMP-12 complex has provided the background information needed for a rational molecular design of the biotin-tagged inhibitors we conceived (see Supporting Information). A fourteen-membered spacer was designed to link the biotin residue to the carboxylic-methyl ester sulfonamide 3 (Scheme 1), that is the shorter, synthetically convenient linker allowing the probe to bind both MMP and avidin binding sites. The biotinylated inhibitor 4 was obtained as shown in Scheme 1. Biotin was first reacted under known procedures (46) with the N-Boc-1,6-diaminohexane 5 to give the amido derivative 6 which, after removal of tert-butyloxy carbonyl protecting group, gave the trifluoroacetylammonium salt 7. Compound 7 was treated with the bromosulfonamide 8 in the presence of cesium

hydroxide, in dimethylformamide as solvent, to give the diastereomerically pure ester 9 in 55% yield. Removal of the methyl ester with lithium hydroxide/water from the latter afforded BTI 4 as a diastereomerically pure compound in 55% yield (Scheme 1). Following the synthetic pathway reported for 4, the biotin-tagged MMP-12 inhibitor 10 was also prepared from 7 and bromosulfonamide 11, as a diasteromerically pure compound (Scheme 2). The affinity properties of the two BTI derivatives toward the selected MMPs were first evaluated by fluorimetric assay (see Supporting Information). The Ki values are reported in Table 1. While BTI 4 had lower Ki values as compared to the corresponding precursor 1, BTI 10 exhibited comparable affinity with respect to its precursor 2. The micromolar Ki of BTI 10 for all the tested MMPs unambiguously demonstrated that the latter is less interesting as a probe to detect these enzymes in vivo, though it might be suitable to collect and purify MMPs from biological samples. Conversely, BTI 4 exhibited a nanomolar affinity for all the MMPs considered (including MMP7) except for MMP-1, for which the Ki was, however, still in the low micromolar range. The molecular details for the observed improved affinity were analyzed by investigating the BTI 4 -MMP-12 complex. Several attempts aimed at obtaining the X-ray structure of the biotin tag inhibitors in complex with MMP-12, either by soaking or cocrystallization, failed, probably for steric reasons owing to the tag. Therefore, interaction of compound 1 and of its biotin tag derivative 4 with the catalytic domain of MMP12 was further investigated following the chemical shift perturbations on 15N-1H HSQC spectra using 15N-labeled protein samples. The chemical shift is a sensitive indicator of protein-ligand interactions and can be used to identify the binding site when the resonance assignment is available (47). The complete assignment of the catalytic domain of MMP-12 complexed with the weak inhibitor acetohydroxamic acid is

available in our laboratory. Increasing amounts of 1 and 4 were added to 200 µM solutions of the protein up to an equimolar concentration. Although several NH signals were shifted by adding the inhibitors, as many as 134 and 129 cross-peaks belonging to protein adducts with 1 and 4, respectively, were easily reassigned. The intensity of signals belonging to NH groups perturbed by the addition of the ligands decreased linearly, while new cross-peaks corresponding to the BTI-bound form of the protein appeared and gradually increased their intensity, in agreement with the effect produced by a slowexchanging ligand. The binding mode of ligands 1 and 4, respectively, was analyzed and compared by reporting Garrett values [(NH)] on a surface representation of the MMP-12 structure (Figure 3). As is evident from Figure 3, for both inhibitors, the region with significant 15N-1H HSQC spectral perturbations involves the catalytic pocket. The analysis of Garrett values rules out relevant additive interactions of the biotinylated tail present in BTI 4 with protein regions outside the catalytic pocket, suggesting a different origin for the observed improved affinity. In addition, a hypothetical binding mode with the biotinylated tail of BTI 4 fitting in the S1 cavity can be completely excluded by the chemical shift perturbations on the 15N-1H HSQC spectra that are similar for 1 and 4 as well as by the Ki values of the BTI 10, which, although biotinylated, showed a low affinity for the enzyme. Likely, extra interactions related to a better fit of 4 into the active site of the enzyme become possible when the fourteen-membered spacer is introduced on BTI 4. These extra interactions are particularly evident for MMP-7 (Table 1) where the affinity increases by 2 orders of magnitude upon the introduction of the linker. Although a high affinity for the target protein is a basic requirement for the proposed bifunctional ligand to play its role, only the ability of the latter to bind MMP and avidin simultaneously could prove its real efficacy as effective BTI.

Figure 4. 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of MMP-12 catalytic domain in the absence (A) and in the presence (B) of compound 4 (equimolar concentration). The two spectra are superimposed to highlight the cross-peak shifts (C). The ternary complex formation Avidin-BTI-MMP is seen in panel D where most of the cross-peaks disappeared.

Two different approaches based on NMR spectroscopy and on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were followed to demonstrate the ternary Avidin-BTI-MMP interaction. Several NMR parameters are strongly influenced by the molecular weight and by the dynamical properties of the investigated macromolecules. Classical NMR experiments such as 15N-1H HSQC usually performed to investigate biomolecules up to 30-40 kDa are inefficient for larger systems due to the fast transverse relaxation rate that broaden the signals beyond the detection threshold (48). Therefore, NH resonances can act as probes to investigate the formation of large protein-protein complexes (49). In the present case, the evolution of the NH signals of the 15N MMP12 catalytic domain complexed with the BTI 4 in 15N-1H HSQC spectra was exploited to monitor the interaction with nonlabeled avidin, given that the binding of the biotin moiety to one of the four binding sites on the tetrameric avidin should provide a 87 kDa complex. Since multiple binding for each avidin molecule may occur, even larger protein complexes are expected in solution. As shown in Figure 4 (panel D), the addition of an equimolar solution of the 65 kDa avidin to a solution of the 15 N-labeled catalytic domain of MMP-12 complexed with the BTI 4 caused the complete disappearance of all NH cross-peaks without any precipitation of the sample. To exclude the presence of aspecific protein-protein interactions, avidin was added to a solution containing 200 µM of NNGH-inhibited-MMP-12 catalytic domain: in this case, no changes were detected in the HSQC spectra. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the strong protein-protein interaction, monitored by the 15N-1H HSQC experiments, is mediated by the BTI 4 which is able to bind MMP-12 and avidin and to prevent, at the same time, an extensive reciprocal reorientation of the complex subunits. Although NMR data allowed us to

ascertain that 4 does bind both avidin and MMP-12 simultaneously, the micromolar concentrations used for these experiments do not provide information on how this simultaneous interaction may affect the nanomolar affinity of the inhibitor to MMP-12. Indeed, possible steric effects related to the presence of the hemopexin domain need to be evaluated to understand the real binding capability of the probe toward functionally active enzymes (50). In this respect, the availability of the active full-length MMP-12 allowed us to ascertain the efficiency of the biotinylated inhibitor to bind simultaneously avidin and the physiologically active enzyme and to quantify the effect of the hemopexin domain on the affinity constant. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is widely applied to investigate protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Information on affinity constant, on binding kinetics, as well as on binding enthalpy can be quickly obtained by using small

amounts of protein samples. In particular, the sensitivity of the SPR technique permits the investigation of high-affinity interactions and monitoring the formation of ternary complexes. SPR analysis was carried out using a ProteOn XPR36 parallel array biosensor equipped with avidin sensor chips (NLC). This chip has an avidin-coated surface that can be used to immobilize biotinylated molecules and macromolecules (51). In our study, BTI 4 was immobilized on channels 1-5 of the chip by injecting PBS-T buffered solutions of the biotinylated molecule at different concentrations. The sixth channel was left blank. The assay was performed by injecting solutions of the full-length MMP-12 on the chip channels and fitting the sensorgrams at four different concentrations. The measured KD (4.6 ( 0.3 nM) (Supporting Information Figure S2) was comparable to the fluorimetric Ki measured for 4 vs the isolated catalytic domain of MMP-12 (BTI 4-MMP-12 complex). The employment of bifuctional ligand BTI 4 for the selective collection of matrix metalloproteinases from biological fluids has been evaluated by using a monomeric avidin-bound column (Pierce). An amount of 2.5 mg of BTI 4 was dissolved in 8.1 mL of Tris-buffer, and the solution (50 uL) was mixed with the same volume of an equimolar sample of MMP-12 (0.4 mM) dissolved into Tris buffer; 25 uL of the mixture so obtained was added to 50 uL of a solution of carbonic anhydrase from erythrocytes (0.1 mM in Tris-buffer). A monomeric avidinbound column (0.6 mL of settled gel) was loaded with the solution of BTI 4, MMP-12, and carbonic anhydrase; then, it was first eluted with 1.4 mL of Tris-buffer and subsequently with a solution of NNGH (1 mM, Tris buffer). Relying on the strong avidin-biotin interaction, the column blocked BTI 4-MMP-12 complex, while carbonic anhydrase was completely washed out. Addition of nanomolar inhibitor NNGH displaced BTI 4 complexed to MMP-12, and the latter was so eluted and separated from carbonic anhydrase (Figure 5). In summary, the present structure-based design led to the development of a potent biotin probe to bind matrix metalloproteinases for possible application in vitro and in vivo. The structural requirements defined through the analysis of the X-ray structures allowed selection of the position on the scaffold where the linker could be introduced and the correct length of the biotinylated tag. As defined by NMR analysis, the origin of the larger affinity observed for BTI 4 is a better fit of the selected scaffold in the catalytic pocket rather than additive interactions of the linker on the protein surface. The enzymatic assay demonstrated a nanomolar to low micromolar (MMP-1) affinity of 4 not only for MMP-12 but also for all the MMPs investigated. Furthermore, the evolution of the 15N-1H HSQC spectra upon the addition of unlabeled avidin to solution of 15N MMP-12 clearly showed that the fourteen-member spacer used to link the biotin unit to carboxylic aryl sulfonamide inhibitor 1 ensures the simultaneous binding of the two proteins without permitting large interprotein mobility. SPR analyses clearly showed the ability of 4 to bind the functional active enzyme MMP-12 and avidin side-by-side. This simultaneous interaction did not affect negatively the nanomolar affinity of inhibitor 4 for MMP-12, given that the SPR data nicely reproduced the fluorimetric values measured for the BTI 4-MMP-12 complex.
