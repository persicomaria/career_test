Two novel adducts of codeinone with barbituric and 2-thiobarbituric acids have been synthesized via Michael addition. The compounds were spectroscopically elucidated by means of IR-LD spectroscopy of oriented samples as a suspension in nematic liquid crystals, UV spectroscopy and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 2-thiobarbituric adduct was characterized by X-ray crystallography. HPLC tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC ESI MS/MS) and thermal methods were also employed. Quantum chemical calculations have been performed with a view to obtaining the electronic structure and vibrational properties of the novel compounds. ” 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The codeine derivatives are opiate agonists, exhibiting an antitussive effect, and are used to relieve mild to moderate pain.1≠3 Many of them become effective by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord.4 In recent years, it has been found that codeinone 1, an oxidation product of codein, possesses antitumour potential, with high cytotoxic activity against human promyelocytic leukaemic cell lines, in addition to the reported antinociceptive activity.5 Furthermore codeinone is an intermediary substance in the syntheses of semi-synthetic opioids such as naloxone, naltrexone, oxycodone and hydrocodone. It is known that codeinone in the living cell is produced from the reaction of codeine with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). The numerous side effects of opiate narcotics, of which physical dependence is undoubtedly the most serious, continue to stimulate the search for better analgesics.6 We decided to study the reactivity of the a,b-unsaturated ketone codeinone 1 towards active methylene compounds such as barbituric acid 2 and 2-thiobarbituric acid 3 via Michael addition with a view to accessing new compounds with potential biological activity (Scheme 1). The choice of the C-nucleophilic reagents was prompted by the fact that the barbiturates contain a hydrophilic functionality (2,4,6-pyrimidinetrione ring structure) and are in therapeutic use as CNS depressants (sedation, hypnotic, preanesthetic, anticonvulsant activity and headache products).7 Such reactions have attracted interest for the preparation of compounds, which have potential utility in the field of biological chemistry.

Work involving artificial, hydrogen-bonding receptors for barbiturate drugs8 has inspired the preparation of barbiturate derivatives possessing specific host≠guest recognition properties.9 Barbiturate groups are strongly electron-withdrawing because they gain aromatic stabilization upon reduction.10 This property has been exploited in the preparation of molecules, which possess very pronounced quadratic non-linear optical properties of interest for potential applications in opto-electronic and photonic technologies.11,12 A large number of reports are available on the reactions of barbituric acids with carbonyl compounds, but not so many studies on their reactions with a,b-unsaturated carbonyl systems13,14 have appeared in the literature. Some work has been carried out on the conjugated addition reaction of C-, N-, O-, S-containing nucleophilic reagents to codeinone molecule.15≠20 2. Results and discussion The Michael addition of barbituric acid 2 and 2-thiobarbituric acid 3 to codeinone leads to the corresponding 8-substituted dihydrocodeinone (Scheme 1). Compounds 4a and 5a were identified by 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry. The reaction gives rise to a new stereocentre at C8 with an (S)-configuration in addition to the stereocentres of the dihydrocodeinone moiety (5R,16S,9R,13S,14R). The bond distribution within the barbiturate moieties is in accordance with a formal carbanionic structure. A second new stereocentre with an (S)-configuration is generated at N1 of the piperidine ring of the codeine moiety due to its protonation. Thus, the compounds possess a formal zwitterionic structure. Compound 5a was characterized by X-ray crystallography, and crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group P212121

accompanied by five solvent water molecules. An ORTEP diagram is depicted in Figure 1. The dihydrocodeinone moiety exhibits the classical T-shape for opiates with a dihedral angle between the mean planes of the A/B/C and D/E rings of 81.0(4)∞ (Fig. 3). The rings are denoted in accordance with the commonly used nomenclature for opiates (Scheme 1). The main structural features of the molecule are very similar to those of codeine, heroin and morphine (Table 1). The ring fusion and conformations are the same as those previously reported for morphine derivatives (see Table 1). Aromatic ring A is planar, B is close to an envelope, C and D assume half-chair conformations and ring E is in a chair form. Rings A and B are effectively coplanar (Fig. 1) with a maximal deviation of only 3.1(4)∞ for B. Rings D and E are also mutually oriented in an approximately co-planar manner. N1 of the piperidine ring (D) forms a moderately strong N≠H¡¡¡O hydrogen bond to O70 of a solvent water molecule (2.745(4) ≈), and O2 of the tetrahydrofuran ring (E) accepts an O≠ H¡¡¡O hydrogen bond of a water molecule (O70) at a distance of 2.889(3) ≈. The 2-thiobarbituric fragment is essentially flat with a deviation from the planarity of 0.02(1)∞, and is found in the keto form as expected. The C8≠C55 bond length of 1.504(3) ≈ is in accordance with single bond character. The C44≠C55 and C55≠C66 distances are 1.394(4) and 1.414(4) ≈, respectively, revealing a partial double bond character. The C44≠O44 and C66≠O66 bond lengths of the carbonyl groups are relatively long with values of 1.267(3) and 1.254(3) ≈, probably due to partial charge delocalization and hydrogen bonding. The molecules of 5a are linked via moderately strong intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions between the 2-thiobarbituric acid fragments. N11 and N33 form hydrogen bonds to the

carbonyl groups of an adjacent symmetry-related molecule. The N11≠H11¡¡¡O44 and N33≠H33¡¡¡O66 distances are 2.810(3) and 2.752(3) ≈, respectively. O44 also accepts a hydrogen bond of length 2.766(3) ≈ from a water molecule (O50), and S22 accepts weak hydrogen bonds of lengths 3.225(3), 3.263(3) and 3.702(4) ≈ from the water molecules O50, O60 and O80, respectively. The co-crystallized solvent water molecules are all interlinked via O≠H¡¡¡O hydrogen bonds. The crystal structure of 4a was also established by X-ray crystallography, and is isomorphous to that of 5a. Although the crystals of 4a were of poor quality, a complete structural determination (not reported) was possible (Fig. 2).

On comparison of the experimental crystal structures of 5a with those of the theoretically predicted structures (Scheme 2), a good agreement between the theoretical and experimental geometrical parameters can be established. The obtained differences of less than 0.0210 ≈ (5a) for distances as well as less than 1.7(4)∞ (5a) for bond angles indicate the suitability of the approximation and the application of the chosen theoretical approach for different codeine systems.

and 5a (Fig. 4) belong to the aromatic fragments in the molecule. An underlining bathochromic shift can be observed for 5a, where the maximum at about 280 nm can be attributed to a CT band (e = 1081 l mol¿1 cm¿1). These experimental data correlate well with our theoretical electronic spectrum, where bands at 262 nm (f = 0.2314) (4a), 260 nm (f = 0.3332) and 288 nm (f = 0.072) (5a) are obtained. The observed small steps in each spectrum, one at ca. 320 nm and another at ca. 370 nm, are artefacts of detector and lamp switching. To investigate the precise geometry changes associated with the electronic excitation state, the geometries of the lowest singlet excited states of 4a and 5a were optimized at the CIS/6-31++G** level of theory for the comparison with the data for ground state optimized at HF/6-31++G**. The data indicate that the structural shifts are predominantly localized in the barbituric fragment in the HOMO and in the positively charged N+H(CH3) fragment, both of which change significantly. The distributions for the HOMO and LUMO (Scheme 3) of the lowest single excited state show a strong optical emission. Direct evidence about the stabilization of the zwitterionic structure of 4a and 5a in solid state can be obtained by looking at the IR-spectra of both compounds in the solid state (Fig. 5). The IR-spectroscopic region within the whole 3500≠2500 cm¿1 range is characterized by a broad strongly overlapped multicomponent band, typical for the amino acids and small peptides32≠34 and assigned to mN+H stretching vibrations. The Fermi resonance effect, observed in these discussed systems, leads to overlapping of the IR-characteristic bands within the 3050≠2750 cm¿1 region, as is typical for stretching modes of the CH3-, CH2- and CH-groups.32≠34 The intensive bands at about 3600 cm¿1 and 3450 cm¿1 belong to stretching mOH vibrations of the solvent molecules. The bands at about at 1714 cm¿1 correspond to the stretching mC@O vibration of the codeine fragment in 4a and 5a, respectively. The in-plane vibrations of the aromatic fragment are observed at about 1575 cm¿1 and 1507 cm¿1, and are only weakly influenced by the type of the barbituric substituent. The discussed maxima are eliminated by pairs at an equal dichroic ratio depending on their local symmetry. More significant are the differences in the IR-spectroscopic patterns of both the compounds assigned to the bending

the bending vibrations of dN+H and dNH are observed in 4a at higher frequencies (1675 cm¿1 and 1545 cm¿1) in comparison to the data of 5a (1640 cm¿1 and 1535 cm¿1). An interesting phenomenon was observed when measuring the NMR-spectra of compounds 4a and 5a in DMSO-d6 (Fig. 1).35 Along with the signals of 4a and 5a, the signals of compounds 4b and 5b (Table 2, Scheme 4) were also discovered. This is due to the fact that adducts 4a and 5a in DMSO occur in two chemical structures in a hemiketal≠ketoalcohol equilibrium, due to ring-chain tautomerism (Scheme 4). Structures such as 4a and 5a, similar to other trans enolizing cycloalkane-1,3-diones with four to six-membered rings, show exactly the opposite dependence on solvent polarity.36 In these compounds, intramolecular hydrogen bonding is excluded on steric grounds, and tautomeric equilibrium seems to be controlled almost completely by the hydrogen-bond acceptor property (Lewis basicity) of the solvent. Apparently, the trans enolic forms are stabilized in solvent that can act as hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA), as DMSO (Gutmann's DN = 29.8 kcal mol¿1, DNN = 0.77). In the polar HBA solvent DMSO, the trans enolic forms are favoured.36 As shown in Scheme 4, the enolization of barbiturate fragments of products 4a and 5a in solvent with high donor properties is accompanied by conformational changes of ring C in the codeinone fragment from half-chair to boat. These conformational changes lead to spatial proximity of O40 and C6 and favour nucleophilic addition of the alcohol function to a C-6 carbonyl group. When the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups are part of the same molecule, six-membered cyclic hemiketals 4b and 5b are obtained, giving rise to a new stereocentre at C*-6 with an (S)configuration (Dreiding model), in addition to the previously available (5R, 16S, 9R, 13S, 14R) stereocentres in the codeinone fragment. The relationships of the open-chain forms to the hemiketal forms (4a/4b and 5a/5b) were measured by their 1H NMR spectra (80:20%, 4:1). For the tautomer pairs (4a/4b and 5a/5b), there is a preference for the open-chain tautomers (4a and 5a) over the cyclic hemiketals (4b and 5b) in DMSO, such as that observed for some hydroxyketones,37,38 but in contrast to the case of levoglucozenone.39

3. Conclusions We have reported the synthesis of two novel codeinone derivatives with barbituric and thiobarbituric acids via a Michael addition. The products were characterized by NMR, UV, IR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Compound 5a was also investigated by X-ray crystallography. Compound 5a crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group P212121 with five co-crystallized solvent water molecules. The barbituric fragments form infinite chains by moderate strong N≠H¡¡¡O hydrogen-bonding interactions between the barbituric acid fragments. The molecules exhibit a T-shape with a dihedral angle between the mean planes of the A/B/C and D/E rings of 81.0(4)∞. The ring fusion and conformations are the same as those previously reported for morphine derivatives. Aromatic ring A is planar, B is close to an envelope, C and D assume half-chair conformations and ring E is in a chair form. Rings A and B are effectively coplanar with a maximal deviation for B of 3.1(4)∞. D and E are also mutually oriented in an approximately co-planar manner. Crystallographic and polarized IR-spectroscopic data show that the compounds are stabilized as zwitterionic structures in the solid state with deprotonated barbituric acids fragments and a protonated N+HCH3 function. We can also conclude that in the solid-state adducts, compounds 4a and 5a only occur in an open-chain form, but in DMSO solution they exist in two forms and the open-chain forms are exclusively observed. In our further investigations, we intend to study the role of solvent on the enolization, the ring-chain tautomerism and the acid≠base equilibrium. On the basis of the crystal structures and their NMR (in DMSO-d6) and IR spectra, compounds 4a and 5a exhibit a preference for the base form (NMe) over the conjugated base form (salt N+HMe). 4.

The general procedures for obtaining 4a and 5a are as follows. Method A: A solution of codeinone 1 (0.093 g, 0.313 mmol) and barbituric acid 2 (0.04 g, 0.313 mmol) in abs ethanol≠water (1:1, 20 ml) was heated at reflux for 5≠8 h. The course of the reaction was followed by TLC. The reaction solution was allowed to cool overnight, and the crystals were separated out and dried in air. Evaporation led to the separation of more solid. Recrystallization was performed from abs ethanol≠water (1:1). Yield about 90%. Method B:40 Codeinone 1 (0.093 g, 0.313 mmol) was dissolved in the minimum volume of chloroform (1 ml), and was added to a solution of barbituric acid 2 (0.04 g, 0.313 mmol) in water (5 ml) at 50 ∞C. Crystals began to form almost immediately. The suspension was stirred at rt for 20 h, then filtered off and the white crystals were washed with water, ether and dried. Yield about 60%.

Adducts of codeinone 1 and barbituric acid 2 or 2-thiobarbituric acid 3 (Scheme 1) were prepared using a simple one-pot procedure. Equimolar amounts of ketone 1 and the appropriate barbituric acid were heated at reflux in abs ethanol≠water (1:1) (method A) for 5≠8 h. The corresponding products, compounds 4a and 5a, exhibit low solubility and precipitate in good yields as colourless crystal upon cooling of the reaction mixture. Various solvents such as acetonitrile and the two-phase systems chloroform≠water and

1,4-dioxane≠water were also screened for this reaction. However, the best results and single crystals appropriate for X-ray analysis were observed using the solvent mixtures abs ethanol≠water (1:1). When the same reactions were carried out in the two-phase system chloroform≠water (method B),21 a suspension of codeinone barbiturate salts appeared immediately. It was necessary to carry out the reaction for 20 h with more intensive stirring of the reaction mixture at room temperature to obtain the products 4a and 5a in yields of about 60%, and in this manner they were obtained as fine powders. 4.2. Materials and methods The X-ray diffraction intensities were recorded on an Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur2 diffractometer equipped with a Sapphire2 CCD detector and graphite-monochromatized Cu Ka radiation. The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. A semi-empirical absorption correction based on multiple scanned reflections was performed with ABSPACK implemented in CRYSALIS 41 The crystal structure was solved by direct methods using RED. SHELXS-97 and refined by full-matrix least-squares refinement on F2 using SHELXL-97.42 Anisotropic displacement parameters were introduced for all non-hydrogen atoms. The oxygen atoms of the solvent water exhibited high thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon and nitrogen were placed at geometrically calculated positions and refined with the appropriate riding model. The positions of the hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen were confirmed from the difference map. The water hydrogen atoms were located in a difference Fourier synthesis and refined with restrained O≠H distance (0.84(2) ≈) and isotropic temperature factors of 1.2 times of the parent oxygen atom. The 1,3-H≠H distance of H80A and H80B was restrained to 1.42(2) ≈. The absolute configuration of the molecule was confirmed by the Flack parameter (¿0.02(2)).43 Relevant crystallographic data and refinement details are given in Table 3, and selected bond length and angles in Table 4. Conventional and polarized IR-spectra were measured on a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FTIR-spectrometer (4000≠400 cm¿1, 2 cm¿1 resolution, 200 scans) equipped with a Specac wire-grid polarizer. Non-polarized solid-state IR spectra were recorded using the KBr disk technique. The oriented samples were obtained as a colloid suspension in a nematic liquid crystal ZLI 1695. The theoretical ap-

proach, as well as the experimental technique for preparing the samples and procedures for polarized IR-spectra interpretation and the validation of this new linear-dichroic infrared (IR-LD) orientation solid-state method for accuracy and precision have been presented previously. The influence of the liquid crystal medium on the peak positions and integral absorbances of the guest molecule bands, the reological model, the nature and balance of the forces in the nematic liquid crystal suspension system and the morphology of the suspended particles have also been discussed.44≠47 The positive and negative FAB mass spectra were recorded on a Fisons VG Autospec instrument employing 3-nitrobenzylalcohol (Sigma≠Aldrich) as the matrix. Ultraviolet (UV-) spectra were recorded on Tecan Safire Absorbance/Fluorescence XFluor 4 V 4.40 spectrophotometer operating between 190 and 900 nm, using solvent acetonitrile (Uvasol, Merck product) at a concentration of 2.5 ¬ 10¿5 M in 0.921 cm quartz cells. Quantum chemical calculations were performed with the 48,49 GAUSSIAN 98 and DALTON 2.0 program packages, and the output files were visualized by means of the CHEMCRAFT program.50 The geometries of the compounds 4a and 5a were optimized at two levels of theory: second-order Moller≠Pleset perturbation theory (MP2) and density functional theory (DFT) using the 631+G** basis set. The DFT method employed is B3LYP, which combines Backe's three-parameter non-local exchange function with the correlation function of Lee, Yang and Parr. Molecular geometries of the studied species were fully optimized by the force gradient method using Bernys' algorithm. For every structure, the stationary points found on the molecule potential energy hypersurfaces were characterized using standard analytical harmonic vibrational analysis. The absence of the imaginary frequencies, as well as of negative eigenvalues of the second-derivative matrix, confirmed that the stationary points correspond to minima of the potential energy hypersurfaces. The calculation of vibrational frequencies and infrared intensities was checked to establish which kind of performed calculations agreed best with the experimental data. As a result, the B3LYP/6-31++G** and MP2/6-31++G** data are presented for the above-discussed modes, where a modification of the results using the empirical scaling factors 0.9614 and 0.8929 is made to achieve better correspondence between the experimental and theoretical values.

The UV spectra in the gas phase and in acetonitrile solution were obtained by CIS/6-31++G** and TDDFT calculations. The thermal analyses were performed in the 300≠500 K range on a Differential Scanning Calorimeter Perkin≠Elmer DSC-7 and a Differential Thermal Analyzer DTA/TG (Seiko Instrument, model TG/DTA 300). The experiments were carried out with a scanning rate of 10 K min¿1 under an argon atmosphere. The elemental analysis was carried out according to the standard procedures for C and H (as CO2, and H2O) and N (by the Dumas method). The melting points were measured on Kofler apparatus and were uncorrected. The TLC was performed on plates of Silica Gel 60 (Merck) with EtOH≠H2O≠concd NH4OH (100:6:4) as the mobile phase. 5.
