Abstract

The crystal structure of the photochemical reaction centre from Rhodobacter sphaeroides Y, a carotenoidcontaining wild-type purple bacterium, has been determined at 3 A resolution. This membrane complex consists of three subunits (281, 307 and 260 residues, respectively) and ten cofactors. It was crystallized in presence of /3-D-octylglucoside. The crystals are orthorhombic with unit-cell dimensions, a = 143.7, b = 139.8, c = 78.7 A,, space group P212t2t with four molecules in the unit cell. Refinement of the structure by X-PLOR and manual reconstructions yielded an R value of 22.1% for 19630 reflections between 7 and 3A,. The secondary structure is highly homologous to those determined for Rhodopseudomonas viridis (Protein Data Bank entry 1PRC) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides R26 (Protein Data Bank entry 4RCR) reaction centres. In the latter two structures one Fe 2÷ ion located between the two quinones is coordinated by four histidines and one glutamic acid. In the Rhodobacter sphaeroides Y structure, Mn 2÷ occupies the same position with identical ligands and geometry. The carotenoid conformation which is a non-planar 15-15'-cis spheroidene molecule in our structure differs from the 13-14-cis 2,4-dihydroneusporene in the Rhodopseudomonas viridis structure.
Introduction

Photochemical reaction centres (RC's) of photosynthetic organisms are membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes which perform the initial step of energy conversion, a transmembrane light-induced charge separation. In purple bacteria such as Rhodobacter (Rb.) sphaeroides, the RC consists of three polypeptides, L (281 amino acids), M (307 amino acids) and H (260 amino acids), and several pigments and cofactor molecules associated with L and M: four bacteriochlorophylls (Bchl's), two bacteriopheophytins (Bpheo's), one carotenoid, two quinones and one metal ion.

other bacterial species including Rhodopseudomonas (Rps.) viridis, the RC is tightly associated with a tetraheme cytochrome subunit. Light excitation of the RC generates a stable charge-separated state, in which a dimer of strongly coupled Bchl's becomes oxidized, and a quinone, QB, is reduced. This occurs after a series of fast electron-transfer reactions through successive intermediate electron carriers: a Bchl, a Bpheo and a quinone, QA. A molecular description of these processes was achieved when the crystal structure of the RC of Rps. viridis, with its bound cytochrome subunit, was solved (Deisenhofer, Epp, Miki, Huber & Michel, 1985a,b). The structure of the RC of Rb. sphaeroides R26 (this strain is a carotenoidless mutant) was then described by two independent groups (Allen, Feher, Yeates, Komiya & Rees, 1988; Chang, El-Kabbani, Tiede, Norris & Schiffer, 1991; E1-Kabbani, Chang, Tiede, Norris & Schiffer, 1991). It was highly homologous to Rps. viridis RC (except for the absence of the cytochrome unit). The dominant feature of these structures is the presence of 11 hydrophobic ce-helices (which in vivo span the membrane), five in L, five in M and one in H. The helices in L and M are related by a pseudo-twofold symmetry axis. This axis, running through the Bchl dimer and the metal ion, also applies to the pigment assembly (except for the carotenoid molecule). These crystallographic studies were extended to RC's from several wild-type strains of Rb. sphaeroides: strains Y (Ducruix & Reiss-Husson, 1987; Arnoux et al., 1989); 2.4.1 (Yeates et al., 1988) and ATCC 17023 (Buchanan, Fritzch, Ermler & Michel, 1993). RC's from these strains differ from the R26 RC by the presence of spheroidene, a carotenoid which does not transfer electrons but protects Bchl's from photodestruction (Cogdell & Frank, 1987). A distinctive property of the Y strain is the presence of Mn 2÷ as the metal ion which interacts with the quinones instead of Fe 2÷ as in the other RC's; this Mn 2÷, which has been characterized by its EPR properties in detergent solutions of the RC (Rutherford, Agalidis & ReissHusson, 1985), is still present in the crystals (Ducruix & Reiss-Husson, 1987).

BERNADETTE ARNOUX et al. In this report, we describe the structure of Y RC refined at 3/~ resolution and compare it with RC structures refined already (Deisenhofer, Epp, Miki, Huber & Michel, 1985a,b; Michel, Epp & Deisenhofer, 1986; Deisenhofer & Michel, 1989; Komiya, Yeates, Rees, Allen & Feher, 1988). We focus mainly on the protein subunits, their secondary structures and their interactions which determine the overall architecture and cohesion of the complex. A detailed description of the pigments, cofactors and of the mode of binding of these molecules to neighbouring residues, will be published elsewhere (Amoux, Ducruix & Reiss-Husson, 1995).

unit. Because of the rapid decay of crystals during irradiation, X-ray intensity data were measured on several crystals, with average size 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.8 mm at the D43 beamline (A = 1.38/~) using the synchrotron radiation source at LURE (Orsay). A full set of data was collected on a dozen of crystals in 1.2 to 2 ° oscillation steps over a qo range of 93 ° to a resolution of

Material and methods

Crystal and diffraction data
RC from photosynthetically grown Rb. sphaeroides Y cells was isolated and purified as already described using lauryl-dimethylamine oxide (Fluka) as detergent (Ducruix, Arnoux & Reiss-Husson, 1988). In the final step this detergent was exchanged for ~-D-octylglucoside (Bachem) by chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with 15mM Tris-HC1 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA and 8 mgm1-1 ~-Doctylglucoside. After adsorption and extensive washing, the RC was eluted by 1 M NaC1 in the same buffer and desalted on a Sephadex G25 column. Final concentration was obtained by ultrafiltration on Centricon 30 cells. The nucleotide sequence of the region which contains the pufL, pufM and pufH genes was determined by the chain-termination method of Sanger using basedenatured double-stranded plasmids as templates (EMBL accession numbers: X63378, X63404, X63405). It only shows one sequence difference at position M140 (Leu to Met) as compared to the 241-type strain (Williams, Steiner & Feher, 1986). Crystallization was carded out by microdialysis (Ducruix, Arnoux & Reiss-Husson, 1988) at 291 K, with equilibrium concentrations of 2 mg m1-1 protein, 12.5-14.5% PEG 4000, 0.22M NaC1, 8mgm1-1 3-Doctylglucoside, in a 15 mM Tris-HC1 buffer, pH8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% sodium azide. PEG was purified before use (Ray & Puvathingal, 1985). The microdialysis was performed in the dark and in closed vials which were initially flushed with argon; this was found to prevent the slow oxidation of the RC, as observed by spectrophotometry of single crystals (Reiss-Husson & Miintele, 1988). Orthorhombic crystals grew as long rods (maximum size 0.4 x 0.3 x 1.5 mm) with a diamond-shaped crosssection with elongation along the a axis. Highly diffracting crystals (3.0/~) were difficult to obtain. Quite often hollow crystals or excessive nucleation led to useless batches. Crystals belong to the orthorhombic system, space group P212121, with cell dimensions a = 143.7, b = 139.8, c = 78.65/~ and one complex per asymmetric

PHOTOREACTION CENTER was used for another complete cycle of refinement at 3.5/~ resolution. Several cycles of manual rebuilding (Jones, 1978), simulated annealing and Powell minimization (X-PLOR 3.0, Briinger, Kuriyan & Karplus, 1987) were performed. As described below, electron density in the transmembrane region was always of better quality than in the surface regions. The crystallographic R factor at 3.5/~ was 24.5% for reflections with Fo > 2or with an overall B factor of 28 ,~2. When X-PLOR Version 3.1 was released, a new set of force fields was distributed (Engh & Huber, 1991). A trial was carried out to modify the force-field files for pigment and cofactors in agreement with those for protein. A cycle of refinement was carried out at 3.5/~ resolution and continued by Powell minimization extending the resolution to 3.0/~. As mentioned above, the diffraction pattern of these crystals was anisotropic with a b direction of poorer quality. So far, we have used X-PLOR to refine the general temperature factor in an anisotropic scheme.

3.0 A; the crystal-to-film distance was 90 mm. The X-ray diffraction pattern was anisotropic with lower resolution along the crystallographic b axis. Two impacts were generally used on each crystal after a rotation of 10° to minimize the effects of radiation damage. The data were processed using the DENZO package (Otwinowski, 1993); ROTAVATA and AGROVATA from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) were used to scale and merge the data. Rsym between 50 and 3/~ resolution is 13.8% for 24200 reflections which correspond to 80% completeness.

Structure and refinement When this work was in progress, two crystal structures of RC from Rb. sphaeroides R26 (a carotenoidless mutant) were under refinement. RC's from the R26 and the wild-type strains crystallize in the same space group with nearly isomorphous unit cells. We used the structure of R26 RC (Chang et al., 1986) as a starting model for the refinement. The first step was a rigid-body refinement. It was followed by one complete cycle of X-PLOR refinement applied to the three polypeptide chains and all the pigments except the quinones and the carotenoid. At the end of this first cycle a difference-Fourier map showed without ambiguity the location of spheroidene and both quinones. During this first cycle of refinement, topology and parameter files used for pigments and cofactors were those kindly provided by H. Treutlein. The choice of these parameters is a matter of debate, as only a few crystal structures of pigments are determined with accuracy. Another set of parameter files, determined by Foloppe, Ferrand, Breton & Smith (1995) for their work on reaction-centre modelling became available to us and

Quality assessment of the final model After individual temperature-factor refinement, a final R factor of 22.9% was obtained with 19 630 reflections between 7 and 3.0/~, with reflections with Fo/F~ > 2.5 or Fc/Fo > 2.5 omitted, 4.5% of the whole data set (Brzozowski, Derewenda, Dodson, Dodson & Turkenburg, 1992). The refinement statistics and measurement of the quality of the geometry of the model are presented in Table 1. The mean B value for the 7136 atoms of the model is 34/~2. Most of the main-chain dihedral angles are within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. All others correspond to residues in loop regions. The estimated error of atomic positions as derived from a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) is 0.4/~.

Definition of solvent-accessible area The program AREA from the CCP4 package was used to calculate solvent accessibility using Lee & Richards' algorithm (Lee & Richards, 1971). A probe sphere of 1.4 fi, radius was used for the area calculations. Differences in accessibility were calculated between the solvent-accessible area of one isolated subunit and the solvent-accessible area of this subunit when associated with another one.
Structural results

The refined model represents 99% of the amino-acid chain of the RC molecule. The electron density around the M140 position can be modelled with a Met residue, in agreement with the sequence data which indicated it was the only residue modified in RC Y strain as compared to the RC 241-type strain (Arnoux et al., 1990). There is no electron density for the eight C-terminal residues of the L chain and for the two C-terminal residues in the H chain. Regions with highest B value are: residues 57 and 58 of the L chain, residues 98, 110-111, 304-305 of the M chain, residues 1-5, 48-51, 80-82, 92-93 and 248-249 of the H chain. They correspond either to N or C termini, or to surface domains exposed to solvent. The electron density for the H chain is of poorer quality compared with the other two chains. The central Mg atoms of the four BCI's have a clearly defined electron density. The electron density for some parts of the phytyl chain of bacteriochlorophylls, bacteriopheophytins and QB tail is tenuous. At 3 A, resolution, localization of solvent or detergent would be ambiguous, except for tightly bounded molecules. No solvent or detergent molecules were positioned in this structure.

General description and secondary structure The overall structure of the wild-type RC from Rb. sphaeroides Y (Fig. 1) is very similar to that of Rps. viridis (Deisenhofer & Michel, 1989) and to those ob-

Definition of secondary structure Accurate assignments of secondary structures of the subunits are crucial for a useful comparison between RC's. Three programs which automatically determine the location of helices and strands were used for this purpose, namely DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983), PCURVE (Sklenar, Etchebest & Lavery, 1989) and DEFINE (Richards & Kundrot, 1988). The distribution in length of helices and/J-strands highlights the differences of each assignment algorithm. Because of these difficulties a consensus method, (Colloc'h, Etchebest, Thoreau, Henrissat & Mornon, 1993) in which each residue is assigned to secondary structure predicted by at least two of these three methods, was used. Definition of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges Hydrogen bonds were identified by applying the following criteria: a maximum distance between donor and

PHOTOREACTION CENTER The overall height of the RC along the local symmetry axis is approximately 73 A, providing about 30/~, for the hydrophobic core region (which has been shown to be covered in the crystal by detergent molecules, Roth, Arnoux, Ducruix & Reiss-Husson, 1991), 15 A for the thickness of the polar periplasmic part (situated above the dimer), and 28 A for that of the polar cytoplasmic part (on the opposite side). When looking at the RC complex at its thinnest width (Fig. lb), the transmembrane bundle of helices adopt a 'V' shape with a thickness of 35 i~. near the periplasmic side and 26/~ near the cytoplasmic side. A 90 ° rotation around the pseudotwofold axis (Fig. la) brings the RC into its largest width which is about 65/~. The secondary structure of wild-type RC was determined by a consensus method (see above) (Fig. 4). The hydrophobic ~-helices A to E of L and M (Table 2), and the only one of H, with a mean length of 25 A. are

tained for the R26 mutant of Rb. sphaeroides (Allen, Feher, Yeates, Komiya & Rees, 1988; Chang, EI-Kabbani, Tiede, Norris & Schiffer, 1991) and, therefore, will only be described briefly. The pigment assembly is located within the L and M subunits, along two branches related by a local twofold symmetry axis (Fig. 2), which also relates the five hydrophobic ¢~-helices of the L subunit, called A, B, C, D and E, to the corresponding ones of M. This axis is equidistant from the pyrrole N atoms of the Bchl's dimer, and passes through the Mn 2+ ion. It applies to the porphyrin rings and to the quinone cycles, but not to the phytyl and isoprenoid tails of these molecules. Deviations from perfect local symmetry between pigment couples are increasing steadily from the dimer towards the quinones, as shown in Fig. 3. The spheroidene molecule is the only pigment molecule asymmetrically located on one of the pigment branches.

The connections between these helices contain several short helices (Table 2) and depart from the local twofold symmetry (see Figs. 4a and 4b). It is worth noting that the connecting sequence between the D and E helices (named de) is different in M and L; in both subunits it contains a short helix (DE) flanked by two loop regions (de1 and de2) and the de2 loop is longer in M than in L. The N-terminal region, before helix A, is also longer in M. In contrast, the connection between the A and B helices is longer in L. The H chain (Figs. 4c and 4d) is the only subunit containing/3-sheets. Its short N-terminal region (H1-H12) located on the periplasmic surface is followed by the only transmembrane helix (H12-H35). Residues H52 to Hl15, starting with three /3-strands, are formed of large loops extended along the surface of the L - M complex in intimate contact with it. The rest of the H chain is intricately folded into a globular domain,

Carotenoid RC from the Y strain of Rb. sphaeroides contains a carotenoid molecule which is a spheroidene (Fig. 5). This long polyenic chain adopts a cis conformation, predicted to be 15-15' by Raman spectroscopy (Lutz, Szponarski, Berger, Robert & Neumann, 1987). The initial Fourier difference map showed positive density at close proximity from monomeric BCMA. It was possible to build a spheroidene molecule in this density with a cis conformation (Arnoux et al., 1989). In the refined map, the electron density extends to both ends of the molecule and allows to discriminate without ambiguity the terminal sp3 and sp2 C atoms (Fig. 6). Both extremities of the chain are surrounded by bulky hydrophobic residues of the M subunit: Phe67, Phe68, Phe85 and Trp75 around C 1, Phe 123 and Phe 162 around C 1'. The carotenoid conformation deviates from planarity in its non-conjugated part (C1'-C8' region). At the level of the central cis bond the closest distance (2.9/~) is observed between C15' C atom of spheroidene and acetyl O atom of BCMA ring I. Manganese-binding site The Mn 2÷ ion, which is located on the local twofold symmetry axis, is sixfold coordinated (Table 3). Glutamic acid (M234) provides two equidistant ligands. The other four ligands are symmetry-related histidines from L and M (L190, L230, M210, M266). Thus, the Mn 2÷binding site is similar to that of Fe z+ in other RC's (Michel, Epp & Deisenhofer, 1986; Allen, Feher, Yeates, Komiya & Rees, 1988). Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges Besides the hydrogen bonds formed in the backbone of c~-helices or fl-sheets, a number of hydrogen bonds are observed which contribute to the stability of the individual subunits, to their mutual interactions and to the binding of pigments. Within each subunit, hydrogen bonds occuring between the main-chain and side-chain residues were analyzed. There are 35, 40 and 24 such bonds within the L, M and H subunits, respectively, with an average distance of 3.0/~. Hydrogen bonds between side chains of two residues in the same subunit are also observed (Table 4). There are six, 12 and 20 such interactions within L, M and H, respectively, with an average length of 2.9/~; they include several salt bridges. For L and M, these bonds are located either on the periplasmic or cytoplasmic sides. Obviously, the largest number of such interactions,

including 12 salt bridges, occurs in H, which is the most hydrophilic subunit. Finally, subunits are tightened by interchain hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, listed in Table 5. Between L and M these bonds principally occur on the hydrophilic cytoplasmic interface. There, the de loops and DE helix of one subunit are bridged with the end of B helix of the other one. The cytoplasmic extremities of EL and DM are also bridged, and the N terminus of M interacts in this region.

Interactions between subunits.
The overall accessible area of the complex, 39 120/~2, is equally balanced between the three subunits L, M and H, wbich contribute 12070, 12930 and 14 120A, 2, respectively. The buried surface area between L and M is 4400 Aft, a value similar to the buried surface area between LM and H (4150/~2). More extensive contacts of H with M than with L are reflected in the values of the buried surface area, 2700/~2 between H and M, and 1550 A,2 between H and L. Interactions between L and M. Accessible area of individual residues in the L M complex may be compared with that calculated for the isolated L or M subunit. A plot of the differences is shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b). A roughly similar pattern is observed for the distribution of interacting residues along L and M sequences. Namely, in L and M all transmembrane helices except A and also the BC and D E connections are more or less involved in intersubunit contacts.

Between L and H a few bonds are observed on the cytoplasmic side and concern principally backbone interactions. Four out of six are located in the N-terminus region of L. Between M and H all the bonds are located on the cytoplasmic part of the RC, except for a few which occur on the periplasmic surface, between the C terminus of M and N terminus of H. Most of the interchain salt bridges are formed between these subunits: a series of charged residues in M (from M232 to M241) in the del loop interact with H residues (H117-Hl18, H230, etc.). A few hydrogen bonds link otherwise the N terminus of M and H in the interface region between H and LM. At the level of the pigments and cofactors which are buried within L and M, carbonyl groups of several pigments are hydrogen bonded to neighbouring residues (Arnoux, Ducruix & Reiss-Husson, 1995).

When neighbouring residues in contact are analyzed van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds and one salt in more detail, the pseudo-twofold symmetry between bridge (cf. Table 5). The N-terminus region of L is thus L and M also applies to contacts in several regions: embedded between the DEM helix, the cytoplasmic end BL +'-+DEM related to BM ~ DEL and DL ~ (DM+CM) of transmembrane helix of H and residues H81, H87 related to DM ~ (DL + CL). However, this symmetry and H95-H98. does not apply for the cytoplasmic end of the C helices: (ii) N-terminus region of the M chain. The extended CL ~ NtermM, CM ~ (DEL + DL). N-terminus region of M lies along the H-chain buried hzteractions between L, M and H. In several regions of surface (H138-H146, H169, H174-H176, H193-H196, the RC, residues from the H chain, scattered throughout H206 and H241). The 15 first residues of M are oththis subunit, are in close contact with both L and M (Fig. erwise in close contact with the cytoplasmic end of CL 8). Hydrophobic interactions occur between the EM helix helix. and both Dr. and H transmembrane helices. The other (iii) The de1 loop of L. This loop (L201-L207) is interacting regions involve mainly the surroundings of connected to M by a salt bridge and to H by one the N-terminus of L and M, the bc loop of L, and the de main-chain...main-chain hydrogen bond. There are also connection of L and M. several van der Waals contacts with M (M140, M144 and (i) N-terminus region of the L chain. 17 out of the M235) and with H (H65-H67). first 28 residues of L are in close contact with either (iv) H108 to H125 region. This region of H is the the M-chain residues (7) or H-chain residues (9) through longest one interacting with L and M. Hydrophobic interactions prevail around residues H108-H112 (GVGPA) surrounded by other apolar segments: L1 l-L14 (VPGG), BC I)E L l l l - L l l 4 (LGIG), H84-H88 (PIALA), H237-H241 O (VAGGL). In this region three proline residues H100, H104, L12 are at less than 10/~ from ProH111. Electrostatic interactions take place from Hl13 to H125 with -50 the DEL helix and with the de1 loop of M (Fig. 9).

Crystal packing Crystal-packing contacts mainly concern the cytoplasmic H138-H166 surface of H and the periplasmic surface of L and M. They involve the connection between At. and BL, and the C terminus of M. Residues H138-H141 are in close contact with L66-L67 and H138-H150 with M292-M305 (Fig. 10). Residues H150 and H163 are also in contact with the first two residues of H belonging to another symmetry-related RC molecule. No salt bridges are observed but both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions occur. It should be stressed that in this membrane protein crystal, detergent associated with the RC occupies about one third of the cell volume (Roth, Arnoux, Ducruix & Reiss-Husson, 1991). /3-D-octylglucoside is mainly organized in a belt around the hydrophobic part of the transmembrane helices. These belts are interconnected into ribbons running along the b axis. The paucity of protein contacts along this direction and the possible flexibility of the detergent ribbons could explain the anisotropy of the crystalline order. Morever, polar contacts are established between the protein at residues AspH46, AspH83, ArgH85, LysH106, AspH107 and the hydrophilic surface of the detergent phase associated with a neighbouring RC.

The study of the three-dimensional structure of the RC from Rb. sphaeroides Y has provided new results about

BERNADETTE ARNOUX et al. two specific features which are still largely debated: the conformation of the carotenoid molecule and the specificity and functional role of the bound metal ion (here manganese). The unique carotenoid molecule which is part of the RC in all wild-type strains of purple bacteria confers protection against photo-oxidation damage, a biologically important function which is clearly related to the particular structure of this pigment. Quite early on (Lutz, Kleo & Reiss-Husson, 1976) it was shown that this carotenoid has a special cis conformation, different from the all-trans one which is the most stable in vitro and which prevails in the antenna complexes of these bacteria. Crystallographic analysis of RC's from Rps. viridis (Deisenhofer & Michel, 1989) and from Rb. sphaeroides wild-type strains Y (Arnoux et al., 1989) and 241 (Yeates et al., 1988) were in agreement for the localization of the cis bond, in close proximity to ring I of BCMA. However, ambiguities persisted for the precise stereochemistry of the molecule: the position of

377

the cis bond, the existence and position of additional twists. In Rps. viridis, the carotenoid (which is 2,4dihydroneurosporene, see Fig. 5) has been fitted in the electron density as a 13'-14'-cis isomer. However the density does not extend to both ends of the molecule: it is missing for C atoms 1 to 3 and 1' to 7' as mentioned in the PDB entry (1PRC). Similarly, before the refinement of Rb. sphaeroides Y structure (Arnoux et al., 1989) only the central part of spheroidene could be fitted in the density. It was built as a central 15-15'-cis isomer on the basis of Raman spectroscopy; the positions of both ends of the molecule were dictated by the shape of the cavity delimited by neighbouring residues. These uncertainties and conflicting results did not provide a convincing and unique model, as pointed out in a recent review (Frank, 1993). However, after refinement of the Y RC structure, our previous model is confirmed and supported by more complete data. Indeed the electron density extends now to the whole carotenoid molecule (Fig. 6); the B values for individual spheroidene C atoms are in a satisfactory

PHOTOREACTION CENTER results in a slightly distorted geometry between H29 and H31. Superposition of the transmembrane helices of the three structures also gives a very good fit for the exposed connections between helices on the periplasmic surface. This was less expected, because in the Rps. viridis crystal this region is bound to and shielded by the tetrahaemic cytochrome whereas in the Rb. sphaeroides crystal it is exposed to the solvent. In spite of the same folding, there are several inversions of charged structurally homologous residues in the L connections. For example, in the ABt. connection, L72 and L82 are Lys and Glu in Rps. viridis, and Glu and Lys in Rb. sphaeroides, respectively; in the C-terminal region, L257 and L268 are Arg and Asp in the former, Asp and Lys in the latter. For the cytoplasmic part of the RC and particularly for H, the fit between Rps. viridis and both Rb. sphaeroides structures is less reliable while the secondary structure is conserved. The low sequence conservation of the H subunit (Williams, Steiner & Feher, 1986) does not lead to different foldings. The amino-acid composition of H indicates a higher abundance of proline residues in Rb. sphaeroides (8.8%) than the average value (5.1%) given for soluble proteins (McCaldon & Argos, 1988). 13 proline residues out of the 23 in the Rb. sphaeroides H subunit are conserved in the three other bacterial species for which the H sequence is known (Berard & Gingras, 1991); some of these are located in structural elements such as the polar domain following the transmembrane helix and in fl-strands. But because of the limited number of sequences of RC's, it seems rather hazardous to draw conclusions on the role of prolines in these complexes. Evidence for the regions of interaction between subunits described above for Y RC may also be provided by the same methods for Rps. viridis RC and appear to be largely conserved. In these interactions, which evidently contribute to the overall packing energy of the complex, one should not underestimate the role of the H subunit. This subunit is sometimes not considered to be essential for the RC function because it does not interact directly with the pigments and cofactors. Yet interactions between H, L and M, particularly in the de loops, contribute to the conformation and the geometry of the quinones and metal-binding sites. This could explain why a loss of the metal may occur when H is split off from the RC in vitro (Agalidis, Nuijs & Reiss-Husson, 1987).* The authors are grateful to Drs Chantal Astier and Martine Picaud for cloning and sequencing the RC * Atomic coordinates have been deposited with the Pr.a:ein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory(Reference: IYST).

range (between 13.5 and 54.1/~2) as compared to the mean B value (34.7/~2). Discrimination between C1 and C I' atoms is reliable because the bulky methoxy group in C 1 is well defined in the density. Thus, the best fit for spheroidene in the electron density is a central 15-15'-cis isomer, with a planar conformation from C2 to C8', and additional out-of-plane twists at the C7' and C4' atoms. We would like to stress that there is no crystallographic support for fitting with a non-central isomer such as a 13-14-cis. Moreover a general consensus for a central cis conformation of spheroidene has been reached, from convincing resonance Raman data (Koyama, Takii, Saiki & Tsukida, 1983; Lutz, Szponarski, Berger, Robert & Neumann, 1987) and recent NMR experiments (De Groot et al., 1992). Another distinctive feature of Y RC is the presence of manganese as the metal ion interacting with the quinones (Rutherford, Agalidis & Reiss-Husson, 1985), instead of iron which is present in RC's of Rps. viridis and in other Rb. sphaeroides strains. The characteristics of the Mn2+-binding site are shown here to be identical to those of Fe 2÷ in the other RC's: the ligands and their positions are the same (Table 3). It has been shown that in the Y strain, Mn 2÷ may be replaced in the RC by other metals by modifying their relative abundance during growth of the bacteria. Fe 2÷ (Rutherford, Agalidis & Reiss-Husson, 1985), as well as Zn 2÷, could thus be substituted (Feezel et al., 1990), while the stability of the isolated RC's would not be impaired. These exchanges probably occur without any structural modification, as the protein structure seems to be stable enough to tolerate a number of divalent metal ions. In vitro replacement of Fe by other metals in Rb. sphaeroides R26 RC's has also be achieved without alteration of electron transport (Debus, Feher & Okamura, 1986). The present work shows that the three-dimensional structure of wild-type Rb. sphaeroides RC is highly homologous to those of the R26 strain (Allen, Feher, Yeates, Komiya & Rees, 1988; Chang, EI-Kabbani, Tiede, Norris & Schiffer, 1991) and of Rps. viridis (Deisenhofer & Michel, 1989). For a detailed comparison of Y and R26 structures, we used the refined coordinates published recently by Yeates et al. (1988) (PDB entry 4RCR), for which completeness of X-ray data is close to our set. The best fit between the Co~ atoms of the 11 transmembrane helices of the two structures indicates an r.m.s, deviation of 0.87 ,A,. This r.m.s, value is 1.0 when the comparison is made between Y and Rps. viridis RC's. In these bacterial species the backbones of the transmembrane helices are thus very similar, despite the rather low conservation of hydrophobic residues exposed to the membrane (Rees, Komiya, Yeates, Allen & Feher, 1989). The only significant difference concerns the transmembrane helix of H because of the insertion of one residue (TrpH21) in Rps. viridis, amidst the helix (Michel, Weyer, Gruenberg & Lottspeich, 1985), which
