The X-ray crystallographic structure of recombinant eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (rEDN) has been determined by molecular replacement methods and refined at 1.83 Å resolution to a conventional R-factor (=S>Fo = - =Fc >/S=Fo =) of 0.152 with excellent stereochemistry. The molecular model of rEDN contains all 1081 non-hydrogen protein atoms, two non-covalently bound sulfate anions and 121 ordered solvent molecules. The polypeptide fold of rEDN is related to those observed in the homologous structures of RNase A, Onconase and angiogenin. rEDN is one of the largest members of the pyrimidine-specific ribonuclease superfamily of vertebrates and has small insertions in four of its seven loop structures and a large insertion from Asp115 to Tyr123. The non-covalently bound SO4 (A) and SO4 (B) anions occupy phosphate-binding subsites of rEDN. The active site SO4 (A) anion makes contacts in rEDN that are similar to those in RNase A and involve the side-chain atoms of Gln14, His15 and His129, and the NH group of Leu130. The SO4 (B) anion makes contacts with the side-chain atoms of Arg36 and Asn39 and the main-chain atoms of Asn39 and Gln40. The equivalent residues of RNase A cannot make contacts similar to those observed in rEDN. The SO4 (B) binding site of rEDN likely corresponds to the P-1 subsite and may be representative of how other homologous RNases bind the P-1 phosphate.

Introduction
Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) is a small, basic ribonuclease (RNase) of the eosinophil granule, and is a member of the pyrimidine-specific RNase superfamily of vertebrates (Gleich et al., 1986). It has been variably referred to as RNase Us , RNase II and non-secretory RNase (Sierakowska & Shugar, 1977) in the existing literature. EDN is a neurotoxin that selectively kills cerebellar Purkinje cells (Gordon phenomenon; Durack et al., 1981), is a potent cytotoxin when injected into Xenopus oocytes (Saxena et al., 1991) and may play a prominent role in several human pathologies (Youle et al., 1993 and references therein). When recombinant EDN (rEDN) is fused to an antibody raised against a cell surface receptor, it is a potent and specific cytotoxin with favorable immunogenic

properties (Rybak et al., 1991). The homologous amphibian RNase, Onconase (Mikulski et al., 1990), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP; Fredens et al., 1982) and bovine seminal RNase (D'Alessio et al., 1991) also display cytotoxic activity in vivo. ECP and Onconase are both neurotoxic and cause the Gordon phenomenon (Fredens et al., 1982; Newton et al., 1994a). In animal models the neurotoxicity is expressed as muscle rigidity, incoordination, ataxia and spasmodic paralysis that are consistent with cerebellar deficit. Neuropathological studies show Purkinje cells are selectively sensitive to these RNases (Durack et al., 1981). Other homologous enzymes, RNase A (Sorrentino et al., 1992) and angiogenin, are not known to be neurotoxic. To extend our understanding of the structure and function of cytotoxic, vertebrate RNases, rEDN has been crystallized and its structure has been determined using molecular replacement techniques. The rEDN structure has been refined at ° 1.83 A resolution to a conventional R-factor ( = S>Fo = - =Fc >/S=Fo =, where =Fo = and =Fc = are the

The final molecular model of the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains an N-terminal formylmethionine residue (fMet), all 134 amino acid residues of EDN, two non-covalently bound sulfate anions and 121 ordered solvent molecules. The molecular conformation of rEDN and its interactions with the sulfate anion ligands are described. We also compare the conformation of rEDN with those of the cytotoxic Onconase (Mosimann et al., 1994) and the non-cytotoxic RNase A (Zegers et al., 1994).

Results
Quality of the refined structure The final (3=Fo =-2=Fc =) acalc electron density is continuous and well defined for all main-chain atoms of residues 1 to 89 and 92 to 134 at the 1s contour level. The N-terminal formylmethionine

and residues Pro90 and Gln91 have discontinuous and relatively weak electron density. All side-chain atoms of residues in the hydrophobic core and nearly all side-chain atoms of residues on the surface of rEDN have continuous electron density at the same contour level. However, the solventexposed side-chains of Gln40, Lys66, Gln91 and Arg117 are disordered beyond Cg and have no associated electron density at the 0.9s contour level. The two non-covalently bound sulfate anions (SO4 (A) and SO4(B)) have distinct lobes of electron density for their respective oxygen atoms. Figure 1(a) shows the (=Fo = - =Fc =) acalc difference electron density contoured at 2.5s and 8s for both sulfate anions after refinement with the atoms of the sulfate anions omitted from the structure factor calculations. The refined sulfate anion positions are displayed in Figure 1(a) superimposed on the electron density. Figure 1(b) shows the (2=Fo = - =Fc =) acalc electron density associated with the active site residues contoured at 1s. Figure 2 is a plot of the average B-factor of

main-chain atoms ( Bmc ; B = 8pu2, where u2 is the mean-square vibrational amplitude) and average side-chain B-factor ( Bsc ) versus amino acid sequence number. In both plots, the residues Ser64 to Lys66 and Thr87 to Ile93 possess the largest average B-factors in the structure. These residues are part of two large, solvent-exposed omega loops (Gly56-Lys69, Pro88-Cys96) and include two of the residues with partially disordered side-chains, Lys66 and Gln91. The remaining residues with ° Bmc e20 A2 are Gly75, Ser76, Glu116 to Arg118, the N-terminal fMet and the C-terminal Ile133Ile134. Residues Gly75 and Ser76 are part of a loop structure and residues Glu116 to Arg118 are part of a helical turn. Figure 3 shows the Ramachandran plot for the 118 non-glycine, non-proline residues of rEDN. The main-chain f, c dihedral angles populate the core (103 of 118 residues) and allowed (15 of 118 residues) regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined in PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). The amino acid sequence of EDN contains two glycine and 12 proline residues. The NH group of Gly56 is ° 2.78 A from Asn53 O and Gly56 adopts a 310-helical conformation (f = -84°, c = -9°) at the end of helix a3 (residues Thr47 to Cys55). Gly75 has a conformation (f = 84°, c = -49°) not normally allowed to non-glycine residues and Gly75 O forms a single intramolecular hydrogen bond with His73 ° Ne2 (3.06 A). The 12 proline residues each adopt trans-peptide conformations and have f, c dihedral angles typical of proline residues. Eight of the proline residues are found in loop structures and

four in segments of b-strand. Pro102, Pro124 and Pro127 are parts of solvent-accessible b-strands on the edge of their b-sheet. Pro79 is the second

The contours represent the most favorable regions of the plot as defined in PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and include 103 of the 118 non-glycine, non-proline residues in rEDN. The remaining 15 residues are in the ``allowed'' regions of the plot (contour not shown).

residue of a central b-strand and is also solventexposed. Molecular conformation of rEDN The polypeptide fold of rEDN is shown in Figure 4 and an all-atom stereo diagram is presented in Figure 5. Table 1 lists the secondary structural elements present in the rEDN structure as defined by PROCHECK and Table 2 lists the b-turns and identifies omega loops (Sibanda & Thornton, 1985; Lesczyznski & Rose, 1986). rEDN is comprised of an N-terminal a-helix and two related lobes. Each lobe contains a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet

and an a-helix with a conserved disulfide bridge between the central strand of the b-sheet and the a-helix. Strands b1, b3, b4 and helix a2 form lobe 1, and strands b2, b5, b6 and helix a3 comprise lobe 2. The conserved disulfide bridges of the two lobes are Cys23-Cys83 (lobe 1) and Cys55-Cys111 (lobe 2) and they share left-handed x3 torsion angles of -81° and -78°, respectively. Helix al packs predominantly against lobe 2, where it contributes residues to the hydrophobic core. Residues at the C terminus of helix a1 (Gln14, His15 and Ile16) pack against amino acid residues of lobe 1. The active site of rEDN is located at the junction of lobe 1, lobe 2 and the N-terminal a-helix, where a cleft is formed running parallel with strand b6. The remaining cysteine residues of rEDN form two additional disulfide bonds that help define the tertiary structure. The disulfide Cys37-Cys96 is between the loop following helix a2 and the central strand (b3) of the b-sheet of lobe 1. The disulfide Cys62-Cys71 is part of the large loop (Gly56-Lys69) between helix a3 and strand b2, a strand at the edge of the b-sheet of lobe 2. These two disulfide bridges have right-handed x3 torsion angles of 88° and 104°, respectively. The stretch of polar residues from Asp115 to Tyr123 (Asp-Gln-Arg-Arg-Asp-Pro-Pro-Gln-Tyr)

forms a single helical turn followed by a type III b-turn-like structure (Figure 6). This compact folding unit corresponds to an omega loop. Asp115 ° O forms a hydrogen bond with Asp119 N (2.89 A) and Asp115 Od1 hydrogen bonds to Arg118 N ° (2.54 A), initiating the helical turn. Additional polar interactions stabilize the conformation of this loop: Arg114 Nh1 donates a hydrogen bond to Gln116 O ° ° (2.82 A); Arg118 Nh1 is 2.97 A from Pro3 O; Asp119 Od2 accepts a hydrogen bond from Asp115 N ° (2.84 A) and Asp119 Od1 is positioned opposite the dipole of helix a1, where it also forms a hydrogen ° bond with Thr6 Og1 (2.68 A). The segment Pro120 to Tyr123 breaks the helix and adopts a type III turn-like conformation that changes the direction of the polypeptide chain and leads into strand b6. The loop l7 and, in particular, the helical turn, packs against and influences the conformation of the N terminus of EDN. The side-chains of Asp115, Arg118 and Asp119 pack against the N terminus of helix a1. Helix a1 is initiated by helix-capping hydrogen bonds from the Thr6 Og1 and O atoms to Gln9 N and Trp10 N, respectively. The conformation of Thr6 is further fixed by the Thr6 N to Gln9 Oe1 hydrogen bond. Residues Pro2 to Phe5 adopt a type I b-turn conformation and the Lys1 Nz forms a hydrogen bond with Phe5 O. The conformation of the N terminus is also stabilized by aromatic stacking interactions between the Phe5

and Trp10 rings (Burley & Petsko, 1986). The side-chain of fMet does not interact with residues of the N terminus or residues Asp115 to Tyr123. The omega loop, l4, of rEDN contains a disulfide bridge (Cys62-Cys71) and two consecutive type I ° b-turns. In loop l4, Asn65 N and Asn65 O are 3.1 A ° from Cys62 O and Arg68 N, respectively. and 2.8 A Another omega loop, l6 contains Cys96 of the conserved Cys37-Cys96 disulfide and a single type ° I b-turn. The O atom of Asn92 of loop l6 is 2.5 A from Asn95 N. The only other non-helical, main-chain i to i + 3 hydrogen bond in the rEDN ° structure is between Ile93 O and Cys96 N (3.0 A). Sulfate anion binding sites Figure 7 shows the hydrogen-bonding network between rEDN and the two, non-covalently bound sulfate anions (SO4 (A) and SO4 (B)). Table 3 presents a list of the hydrogen bonds to the anions. The anions are presumed to be sulfate, based upon the presence of (NH4 )2 SO4 (and the absence of phosphate) in the crystallization medium. The SO4 (A) anion binds at the active site of rEDN where ° Gln14 Ne2 and His15 Ne2 of helix a1 are 3.23 A and ° from O-4 and O-1 of the SO4 (A) anion, 3.08 A respectively. The remaining two hydrogen bonds between rEDN and SO4 (A) are from His129 Nd1 ° ° (2.63 A) and Leu130 N (2.61 A) of strand b6 to O-3

The residues of Asp115 to Asp119 form a single helical turn and Pro120 to Tyr123 forms a type III b-turn. The side-chain of Asp119 forms a hydrogen bond to the side-chain of Thr6 and the negatively charged carboxylate balances the positively charged dipole moment of the helix a1.

The thick lines represent the main-chain and the sulfate anions of rEDN, the thin lines represent the side-chains of rEDN and hydrogen bonds are represented as broken lines. The SO4 (A) anion at the active site contacts the side-chains of Gln14, His15 and His129 and the main-chain of Leu130.

Wat201 accepts a 3.05 A ° hydrogen bond from Gln14 Ne2 and is E3.30 A from O-1 and O-3 of the anion. This water molecule has counterparts in both the RNaseA and the ° Onconase structures. Wat282 forms a 2.73 A hydrogen bond with O-2. The side-chain of the catalytically important Lys38 is well defined in the electron density maps and the Nz atom forms a hydrogen bond with the Gln14 Oe1. In this ° conformation, Lys38 Nz is 3.9 A from O-4 of the anion. The anion SO4 (B) is bound to the surface of a single rEDN molecule by main-chain hydrogen

Gln40 N is 3.12 A from O-2 and Asn39 N is ° and 3.28 A from O-4 and O-2, respectively. ° 2.60 A Arg36 Nh1 and Arg36 Nh2 are within hydrogen bond distance of O-4 and O-1, respectively. The alternative side-chain conformation (occupancy = 0.30) of Asn39 provides two additional contacts with O-3 and O-4. Wat256 is the only ordered solvent molecule that forms a hydrogen bond with SO4 (B). The distance between the two sulfur atoms ° of SO4 (A) and SO4 (B) is 9.4 A. The second anion-binding site has not been observed in other structures of members of the RNase superfamily. Intermolecular packing in rEDN Figure 8 is a stereo diagram representing the intermolecular packing within the rEDN crystal. Table 4 lists the polar hydrogen-bonding interactions and closest van der Waals contacts between rEDN and symmetry-related molecules. Two hydrogen bonds are accepted by Gln12 Oe1 (Arg97 Ne, Arg97 Nh2 ) and by Arg35 O (Arg114 Ne, Gln116 Ne2 ), respectively, and Gln21 Ne2 donates hydrogen bonds to Cys55 O and Asn57 O. Thr61 also forms a pair of hydrogen bonds and is involved in the sole polar intermolecular contact between main-chain atoms (Thr61 N to Thr86 O). Gln12, Gln21, Arg35 and Thr61 account for eight of the 12 unique intermolecular hydrogen bonds and each residue is in contact with a different symmetry-related molecule. The Pro3 and Gln4 residues at the N terminus and Tyr33 account for six of the 14 van der ° Waals contacts <3.90 A. Four additional proline residues Pro58, Pro88, Pro102 and Pro124, also participate in packing interactions. The shortest

The superpositions of rEDN with RNase A and Onconase have rmsd ° ° values of 1.27 A and 1.42 A for the 106 (of 118) and 86 (of 101) common Ca atoms that can be ° superposed within 3.8 A, respectively. Residues in helices a1 to a3 and those in strands b1 to b6 account for nearly all the equivalent residues in the three structures. The residues Ile30 to Arg35 of

rEDN extend helix a2 relative to the equivalent helix in RNase A. These are the only residues of EDN secondary structures that do not superpose with their counterparts in RNase A and Onconase. Loops l1, l2, l4, l6 and l7 (Table 3) are the sites of insertions and deletions in the three structures and include those remaining residues that do ° not superpose within 3.8 A in the overlaps. The conformation and intramolecular packing between the N terminus (loop l1) and the nine residue insertion (loop l7) of rEDN has been described. Loop l2 of rEDN is six residues shorter and one residue shorter than the equivalent loops in RNase A and Onconase, respectively; the conformation of l2 is completely different in all three structures (Figure 9).

loops in RNase A. In each case, the additional residues of rEDN result in conformational differences along the entire length of the loop. Loops l4 and l6 of Onconase are eight residues shorter and six residues shorter than the equivalent loops of rEDN and have very different conformations in RNase A and Onconase (Mosimann et al., 1995). Figure 10 shows the superposed active sites of RNase A (Zegers et al., 1994) and rEDN. The main-chain and Cb atoms of residues Thr6 to His15, Arg36 to Thr42 and Val126 to Ile133 of rEDN were superposed with the equivalent residues of RNase A by least-squares. The amino acid sequence

identity for these 25 residues is 64% and the rmsd ° is 0.60 A for 125 common atoms. The sulfate anion of the RNase A structure and SO4 (A) of rEDN have nearly identical conformations and their sulfur ° atoms differ in their positions by 0.6 A. This ° difference is less than the 0.9 A that separates Asp121 Ca (RNase A) and Asp131 Ca (rEDN). The side-chains of Gln11, His12, His119 and the main-chain of Phe120 of RNase A form hydrogen bonds with the anion. Gln14, His15, His129 and Leu130 of rEDN make equivalent contacts with SO4 (A). His119 of RNase A adopts two alternative conformations in the RNase A structure (Zegers

Figure 10. A HARDCOPY (M. Israel, unpublished) stereo diagram of the least-squares superposed active-site residues and bound anions of rEDN and RNase A are shown from the same vantage point as that in Figure 7. The ° rmsd for the 125 main-chain and Cb atoms is 0.60 A. The thick lines represent rEDN and its anions and the thin lines represent RNase A and its anion. The conformations of the catalytic residue and the positions of the active site anions are closely similar in the two structures. The conformation of His129 of rEDN is equivalent to one of the two alternative conformations (inactive) of the His119 of RNase A. The SO4 (B) anion of rEDN makes a number of too-close contacts with Pro42 of RNase A. This proline residue probably prevents RNase A from binding an anion in a manner analogous to the binding of SO4 (B) to rEDN.

The Asn70 and Asp112 residues of rEDN are within the B2 subsite and Thr42 and Gln40 are in the B1 subsite.

et al., 1994). The His129 conformation of rEDN corresponds to the catalytically inactive conformation of His119 of RNase A. His129 can adopt the active conformation observed in RNase A by rotation about its x1 and x2 torsion angles. In order for His129 to adopt the active conformation, Wat282 would have to be displaced (Figure 7). In the superposition of RNase A and rEDN, the ° SO4 (B) of rEDN is less than 1 A from the side-chain of Pro42 of RNase A. Pro42 of RNase A is the residue equivalent to Asn39 of rEDN. In the crystal structure of rEDN, the NH and Nd2 atoms of Asn39 donate hydrogen bonds to SO4 (B) (Figure 7). Obviously, Pro42 of RNase A cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor and, as a result, RNase A cannot bind an anion in a manner equivalent to the SO4 (B) binding observed in rEDN. rEDN has been superposed with the RNase A-thymidylic acid tetramer (d(Tp)4 ) complex structure (Birdsall & McPherson, 1992) by leastsquares. Figure 11 is a stereo diagram of rEDN and three of the four superposed thymidylic acid

moieties. The conformation of d(Tp)4 has not been altered, though one nucleotide has been omitted for clarity. The base, ribose and phosphate moieties shown in Figure 11 are B2 , B1 , B0 , R2 , R1 , R0 and P1 , P0 , P-1 using the nomenclature of Richards & Wykoff (1971: and see Figure 12). In the rEDNd(Tp)3 model, the B2 , B1 , R2 , R1 , and P1 moieties can make specific interactions with rEDN, while the P-1 ° phosphorus atom of the model is more than 3.0 A from the sulfur atom position of SO4 (B). The B1 and B2 bases both adopt an anti conformation. The side-chains of Asn70 and Asp112 are within the B2 subsite and the N and Og1 atoms of the invariant Thr42 of rEDN complement the hydrogen-bonding potential of the O-2 and N-3 atoms of B1 . The hydrogen-bonding potential of the O-4 atom of B1 is unsatisfied in Figure 11. The R2 and R1 moieties are involved in van der Waals contacts with the Trp7 ring and Leu130, respectively. The P1 phosphate group in the rEDN-d(Tp)3 model has a position similar to the SO4 (A) anion position observed in rEDN. The P1 phosphate group of the

The P1 phosphate group binds to the active-site of rEDN and the scissile phosphodiester bond is the P1-O(5'). Note that the P1 , R1 and B1 moieties together are equivalent to a 3'-monophosphate nucleotide.

549 through its main-chain and side-chain atoms (Figure 10). In Figure 11, the SO4 (B) anion of rEDN is nearest to the P-1 phosphate group of the RNase ° A-d(Tp)4 model (>3.0 A between sulfur and phosphate). As a result, the SO4 (B) binding site likely corresponds to the P-1 subsite of rEDN. Within the superfamily, the residue equivalent to Pro42 of RNase A is not highly conserved. It is present in pancreatic enzymes and bovine angiogenin but not in amphibian or eosinophil RNases. Thus, the P-1 phosphate binding in RNase A may not be representative of the P-1 phosphate binding in all related enzymes. Instead, relatives that do not have an imino acid at this position may bind the P-1 phosphate group similar to the observed SO4 (B) binding mode of rEDN. The enzymatic activity of EDN towards oligoribonucleotide substrates is comparable with that of RNase A (Iwami et al., 1981). EDN has a 20-fold preference for cytidine over uridine in the pyrimidine (B1 ) subsite and a 100-fold preference for adenosine over guanosine in the B2 subsite when using diribonucleotide substrates at pH 6.5 (Sorrentino et al., 1992). In the superposition of rEDN and d(Tp)4 (Figure 12) the N-2 and O-3 atoms of the B1 base can hydrogen bond to the invariant Thr42. In RNase A, O-4 of B1 hydrogen bonds to a solvent molecule that hydrogen bonds to Ser123 (Zegers et al., 1994). The equivalent residue of rEDN is Ile133 and it cannot make analogous interactions. The nearest potential hydrogen bond donor or acceptor of rEDN is Gln40. This is interesting, as Gln40 can adopt conformations that allow it to hydrogen bond to SO4 (B) yet does not. In the X-ray structure of rEDN, the Gln40 side-chain is solvent-exposed and disordered beyond Cg. Perhaps Gln40 is responsible for binding the O-4 of uracil or N-4 of cytosine. Like Ser123 of RNase A, Gln40 can either accept or donate hydrogen bonds. This suggests that both cytosine and uracil can be accommodated within the B1 subsite and explains the observed specificity of rEDN. A similar situation is observed in the X-ray crystallographic structure of Onconase (Mosimann et al., 1994), where Val101 and Lys33 are equivalent to the Ile133 and Gln40 residues of rEDN. A molecular model of an Onconase-d(UpG) complex (S.C.M., R.J.Y. & M.N.G.J., unpublished results) indicates that Lys33 is the nearest potential hydrogen-bond donor to the O-4 position of uracil. The modeling of rEDN and Onconase in complex with substrate analogues suggests a residue of strand b1 (Gln40 of rEDN, Lys33 of Onconase) replaces the Ser123 (strand b6) interaction observed in the RNase A-complex structures (Zegers et al., 1994). In the high-resolution RNase A complex structures (Zegers et al., 1994), the B2 base hydrogen bonds to Asn71 and Glu111. The equivalent residues of rEDN are Asn70 and Asp112. In Figure 11, Asn70 of rEDN can hydrogen bond to O-4 of B2 , while Asp112 is directed at the C-5 methyl group. The B2 base of the RNase A-d(Tp)4 structure is rotated by 180° when compared with the

model is located in the rEDN active site and can hydrogen bond with Gln14 Ne2, His15 Ne2, His129 Nd1 and Leu130 N. In the RNase A-d(Tp)4 structure, the P-1 phosphate group makes van der Waals contacts with Pro42.

Discussion
The polypeptide fold of rEDN is related to those observed in the homologous RNase A (Zegers et al., 1994), Onconase (Mosimann et al., 1994) and angiogenin (Acharya et al., 1994) X-ray crystallographic structures. These enzymes share less than 35% amino acid sequence identity and they range in size from 104 residues (Onconase) to 134 residues (EDN). Given the relatively low sequence identity and the size variation it is not surprising that the molecular surface of rEDN is different from that of other pyrimidine-specific RNases of known structure. The loops l2, l3 and l6 of rEDN have significantly different conformations from those observed in structures of other vertebrate RNases. This is significant, since enzymes belonging to the vertebrate RNase superfamily have a variety of biological functions and properties besides digesting RNA. The non-ribonucleolytic properties of several of the vertebrate enzymes are known to be associated with their specific binding to targets on the cell surface (Wu et al., 1993; Hallahan et al., 1991; Titani et al., 1987). These loops may play a role in the function of EDN. Interestingly, rEDN and Onconase share little structural homology other than their general fold, yet EDN, ECP and Onconase are the only neurotoxins within this superfamily. Additionally, there is a large insertion exclusive to EDN and ECP (i.e. EDN: Asp115 to Tyr123) that may contribute to their unique properties. These enzymes play roles in host defense and are secreted in the proximity of parasites, where they act as cytotoxic agents. At present, it is not known if the residues of the unique insertion are required for the biological function of EDN and ECP. rEDN has two discrete SO4 anion-binding sites. The active site SO4 (A) an the SO4 (B) anions observed in the rEDN structure are wholly bound by a single rEDN molecule and do not make contacts with symmetry-related molecules. In the structures of RNase A-oligodeoxynucleotide complexes (Birdsall & McPherson, 1992; FontecillaCamps et al., 1994), phosphate, ribose and base subsites have been identified for extended substrates (Figure 11). The SO4 (A) (P1 ) and SO4 (B) ° anions are 9.4 A apart in the rEDN structure, and this distance is considerably larger than the distance between consecutive phosphate groups of RNA or DNA when in an extended conformation. This indicates that the SO4 (B) binding site of rEDN is not P0 or P2 . In the RNase A-d(Tp)4 structure, the P-1 phosphate group makes van der Waals contacts with the side-chain of Pro42. The rEDN residue structurally equivalent to Pro42 of RNase A is Asn39 and it donates hydrogen bonds to SO4 (B)

high-resolution RNase A-d(CpA) structure. The pseudorotation angle of the sugars R1 and R2 , and the glycosyl torsion angle of the bases B1 and B2 are comparable in these structures. The conformational difference arises from large differences in the b (P-O5'-C5'-C4') and g torsion angles (O5'-C5'-C4'C3') of the nucleic acid backbone of these structures. If the B2 base binds as seen in the high-resolution d(CpA) structure, Asp112 will be in close proximity to the N-3 atom. Arg68 is an additional rEDN residue that may be near enough to contribute to binding the B2 base. In a recent comparative molecular modeling assessment, loops l2, l3 and the omega loops l4, l6 and l7 (the large insertion of rEDN) were not successfully modeled by the participating groups (Mosimann et al., 1995). These large loops are the sites of insertions and deletions in comparisons of the primary structures of rEDN, RNase A and Onconase, and correspond to the regions of the greatest divergence in structural superpositions of these enzymes (Figure 9). In rEDN, it appears the loops of RNase A and Onconase represent poor models of the conformations of loops in rEDN as a result of the low level of sequence identity and the presence of insertions and/or deletions. The conformation of the large insertion of rEDN is exceedingly difficult to predict, as it packs against additional inserted residues at the N terminus (Figure 6). A successful prediction of the conformation of this loop would require the correct simultaneous prediction of the conformation of the N terminus as well. In many ways this is a small version of the folding problem. These difficulties suggest that the prediction of the observed X-ray crystallographic conformation of large, divergent loop structures is not yet possible using current methods.

Methods
The rEDN gene has been synthesized and the rEDN protein expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli BL21. The inclusion bodies have been denatured, renatured and dialyzed before a two-step chromatographic purification protocol (Newton et al., 1994b). The recombinant enzyme has an additional fMet-1 residue, retains full enzymatic activity and does not have the post-translational modifications that are present in EDN isolated from human body fluids. Wild-type EDN is glycosylated at C-2 of the indole group of Trp7 (Hofsteenge et al., 1994) and is N-glycosylated at all Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequences (where X represents any amino acid except proline; Asn17, Asn59, Asn65 and Asn85)

except Asn92 (Beintema et al., 1988). The recombinant enzyme retains the cytotoxic activities of wild-type EDN. Crystallization trials were performed using the vapor diffusion technique and hanging drops. A sparse-matrix screening for appropriate crystallization conditions (Jancarik & Kim, 1991) yielded crystals in (NH4 )2 SO4 solutions near neutral pH. The crystal used for the high-resolution data collection was grown over a 1 ml reservoir solution containing 40% (NH4 )2 SO4 , 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) and 5% (v/v) ethanol. The hanging drop, containing initially 3 ml of 21 mg/ml rEDN and 3 ml of the reservoir solution, produced a rod-shaped crystal with dimensions of 0.60 mm × 0.15 mm × 0.15 mm. The rEDN crystals are orthorhombic (space group P21 21 21 ) and the unit cell dimensions determined from the high-resolution data set are: ° ° ° a = 53.42 (0.07) A, b = 57.35 (0.08) A, c = 42.26 (0.06) A and a = b = g = 90°. The calculated solvent content is 40% ° (v/v) and the Vm is 2.04 A3/Da (Matthews, 1968). The X-ray intensity data were collected locally on twin San Diego Multiwire Systems (SDMS) multiwire proportional counters. Graphite monochromated CuKa ¯ X-rays were generated with a Rigaku Rotoflex RU-200BH rotating anode source operated at 40 kV and 150 mA. The ° data were collected and processed to 1.83 A using the SDMS software (Hamlin, 1985). Statistics for the processing of the native data set are presented in Table 5. ° ° In the 1.97 A to 1.83 A resolution range, 69% of the unique reflections have I e s(I ). The structure of rEDN was determined by the molecular replacement method using the AMORE suite of programs (Navaza et al., 1994). The rotation and translation function solutions were obtained using a truncated model of RNase A. In the search model, residues 17 to 26 were deleted, residues 2, 7, 10, 29, 31, 76, 79 and 98 were truncated to alanine, and residues 13, 33, 37, 61, 66, 85 and 90 were modeled as serine. The deleted residues of the RNase search model correspond to an insertion in the RNase A sequence relative to the EDN primary structure. The residues that were modeled as alanine or serine have large, solvent-exposed sidechains that are not conserved in the alignment of the sequences of the two enzymes. With this search model, the correct rotation function solution was the fourth ° largest peak when using data extending from 12 to 2.5 A ° resolution and an integration radius of 24 A. The correct translation function solution has the highest correlation coefficient (0.386) and the lowest R-factor (52.4). Its correctness was evaluated using packing functions, and by calculating and interpreting electron density maps. The molecular replacement search model was fitted to the electron density using the TOM Alberta/Caltech 2.8.0 interactive graphics program (based on Jones, 1985). The fMet and Gln116 to Pro122 were the only residues that could not be fitted unambiguously into the initial electron ° density maps. Data between 8.0 and 1.83 A resolution with intensities greater than 2s were selected for the initial stages of refinement using the simulated annealing

protocol described in the X-PLOR manual (Brunger et al., ¨ 1987). During this procedure the crystallographic R-factor (R = S>Fo = - =Fc >/S=Fo =, where =Fo = and =Fc = are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes) was reduced from 0.519 to 0.263. Two sulfate anions and the segment of residues Gln116 to Pro122 were fit into a 3=Fo = - 2=Fc = electron density map calculated after the molecular dynamics refinement. All subsequent steps in the refinement of rEDN made use of the TNT program suite (Tronrud, 1992) and data in the range ° ° 1.83 A E dmin E 20 A with intensities greater than 1s. Interactive graphics refitting sessions made use of electron density maps calculated with 3=Fo = - 2=Fc =, 2=Fo = - =Fc = and =Fo = - =Fc = coefficients obtained from TNT. At several points during the refinement, standard omit maps were calculated (Bhat, 1988). In these maps, selected atoms were omitted from a short refinement (five cycles) and the subsequent map calculation. The resulting electron density in the region of the omitted atoms represents a relatively unbiased view of the true electron density at these positions. The residues Ser64 to Lys66, Pro88 to Ile93 and the sulfate anions were all checked against their density in these maps at several stages of the refinement. The side-chains of Asn25, Asn39 and Asn104 were examined in similar omit maps and subsequently modeled as having alternative conformations in the rEDN structure. At occupancies of 0.3 and 0.7 for the two alternative conformations, the average side-chain B-fac° tors of each of the conformations are between 17 A2 and ° 26 A2. The N-terminal fMet residue was built into =Fo = - =Fc = difference electron density towards the end of the refinement. Throughout the refinement no effort was made to refine water molecules with alternative positions and/or variable occupancies. The final model contains 121 ordered, full-occupancy water molecules and has an R-factor of 0.152 for all data with I/s(I ) e 1.0 from 20 to ° 1.83A resolution. The stereochemical parameters associated with the final cycle of least-squares refinement are given in Table 6. The rEDN coordinates will be deposited in the Protein Data Bank at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (Bernstein et al., 1977) and until then are available from the authors upon request. The least-squares superpositions of RNase A, Onconase and rEDN were computed (Kabsch, 1978)

using the O program suite (Jones et al., 1991). The active sites of rEDN and RNase A were superposed using the main-chain and Cb atoms of Thr6 to His15, Arg36 to Thr42 and Val126 to Ile133 of rEDN and the equivalent atoms of RNase A (Zegers et al., 1994).
