Abstract In human, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (HsPNP) is responsible for degradation of deoxyguanosine and genetic deficiency of this enzyme leads to profound T-cell mediated immunosuppression. PNP is therefore a target for inhibitor development aiming at Tcell immune response modulation and has been submitted to extensive structure-based drug design. This work reports the first crystallographic study of human PNP complexed with acyclovir (HsPNP:Acy). Acyclovir is a potent clinically useful inhibitor of replicant herpes simplex virus that also inhibits human PNP but with a relatively lower inhibitory activity (Ki ¼ 90 lM). Analysis of the structural differences among the HsPNP:Acy complex, PNP apoenzyme, and HsPNP:Immucillin-H provides explanation for inhibitor binding, refines the purine-binding site, and can be used for future inhibitor design.

PNP catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of N-ribosidic bonds of both purine nucleosides and deoxynucleosides, except adenosine, generating purine base and ribose (or deoxyribose) 1-phosphate [1]. The major physiological substrates for mammalian PNP are inosine, guanosine, and 20 -deoxyguanosine [2]. PNP is specific for purine nucleosides in the b-configuration and exhibits a preference for ribosyl-containing nucleosides relative to the analogs containing the arabinose, xylose, and lyxose stereoisomers [3]. Moreover, PNP cleaves glycosidic bond with inversion of configuration to produce a-ribose 1-phosphate, as shown by its catalytic mechanism [4].

Human PNP is required for normal T-cell development. Patients lacking PNP have severe T-cell immune deficiency, while B-cell function is unaffected [5]. Dividing T-cells express an active deoxycytidine kinase, whose normal role is the salvage of deoxycytidine to form dCMP, which is then converted to dCTP for DNA synthesis in activated T-cells [6]. However, upon inhibition of PNP activity and ensuing deoxyguanosine accumulation, deoxycytidine kinase accepts deoxyguanosine to form dGMP, which is then converted to dGTP. Accumulation of dGTP within cells is due to the inability of nucleotides to cross the cell membrane. Ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase is inhibited by dGTP leading to inhibition of cellular formation of dCDP and dUDP [7], thereby preventing DNA synthesis. Specific T-cell, rather than B-cell, impairment is attributed to a higher level of deoxycytidine kinase

activity in T-cells and a protective effect in B-cells of high nucleotidase activity versus deoxynucleotide 50 phosphates, so that dGTP accumulates in T-cells, but not in B-cells [8]. Type IV autoimmune disorders are caused by inappropriate activation of T-cells by selfantigens and, accordingly, are a primary target for PNP inhibitors for treatment of diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disorders, and multiple sclerosis. In addition, T-cell leukemias and lymphomas would be primary proliferative targets for PNP inhibitors [9]. Acyclovir (9-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy-methyl)guanine) is a HsPNP inhibitor with moderate inhibitory activity in human erythrocyte PNP (Ki ¼ 90 lM) [10]. Because of purine ring and the 2-hydroxy-ethoxy-methyl group that may mimic a portion of the naturally occurring pentosyl ring, acyclovir is referred to as an acyclic nucleoside analog of 20 -deoxyguanosine. Neither acyclovir nor its metabolites are phosphorylated by HsPNP [10]. Figs. 1A­D show the molecular structure of four PNP inhibitors discussed in the present work. In spite of displaying weak inhibitory activity, there is a great interest in knowing the structure of the acyclovir in complex with HsPNP because of its potential use as lead compound for structure-based drug design. Furthermore, there are no atomic coordinates available for human PNP complexed with inhibitors, and all previous structural reports are based on molecular modeling and low-resolution crystallographic structures [8,11]. The use of recombinant human PNP [12], cryocrystallographic techniques, and synchrotron radiation source opened the possibility to improve the quality of structural data about human PNP [13], and to explore the structure of complexes between human PNP and inhibitors. We have obtained the crystallographic structure of the complex between HsPNP and acyclovir

(HsPNP:Acy). This is the first structural report of the complex between human PNP and acyclovir and our analysis of the structural differences among the HsPNP:Acy complex, PNP apoenzyme [13], and HsPNP:Immucillin-H (PDB accession code: 1PF7) provides explanation for the inhibitor binding to the enzyme, refine the purine-binding site, and can be used for future inhibitor design.

Materials and methods
Crystallization and data collection. Recombinant human PNP was expressed and purified as previously described [12]. HsPNP:Acy was crystallized using the experimental conditions described elsewhere [14,15]. Rhombohedral-shaped crystals with dimensions up to 0.5 mm were obtained overnight. In brief, a PNP solution was concentrated to 13 mg mLÀ1 against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) and incubated in the presence of 0.6 mM of acyclovir (Sigma). Hanging drops were equilibrated by vapor diffusion at 25 °C against reservoir containing 17% saturated ammonium sulfate solution in 0.05 M citrate buffer (pH 5.3). In order to increase the resolution of the HsPNP:Acy crystal, we collected data from a flash-cooled crystal at 104 K. Prior to flash cooling, glycerol was added, up to 50% by volume, to the crystallization drop. X-ray diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of  1.431 A using the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Station PCr, Laboratrio Nacional de Luz Sncrotron, LNLS, Campinas, Brazil) and a o i CCD detector (MARCCD) with an exposure time of 30 s per image at a crystal to detector distance of 120 mm. X-ray diffraction data were  processed to 2.8 A resolution using the program MOSFLM and scaled with the program SCALA [16]. Upon cooling the cell parameters shrank from a ¼ b ¼ 142:90,   c ¼ 165:20 to a ¼ b ¼ 139:06 A and c ¼ 160:57 A. For HsPNP:Acy  complex, the volume of the unit cell is 2.689 Â 106 A3 compatible with  one monomer in the asymmetric unit with Vm value of 4.647 A3 DaÀ1 . 3 À1 Assuming a value of 0.26 cm g for the protein partial specific volume, the calculated solvent content in the crystal is 74% and the calculated crystal density is 1.10 g cmÀ3 . Crystal structure. The crystal structure of the HsPNP:Acy was determined by standard molecular replacement methods using the

Structure refinement was performed using X-PLOR [18]. The atomic positions obtained from molecular replacement were used to initiate the crystallographic refinement. The overall stereochemical quality of the final model for HsPNP:Acy complex was assessed by the program PROCHECK [19]. Trimeric structure and atomic models were superposed using the program LSQKAB from CCP4 [16].

Results and discussion Molecular replacement and crystallographic refinement The standard procedure of molecular replacement using AMoRe [17] was used to solve the structure. After translation function computation the correlation was 71% and the Rfactor 32%. The highest magnitude of the correlation coefficient function was obtained for the Euler angles a ¼ 113:46°, b ¼ 58:52°, and c ¼ 158:43°. The fractional coordinates are Tx ¼ 0:1627, Ty ¼ 0:6240, and Tz ¼ 0:0329. At this stage 2Fobs À Fcalc omit maps were calculated. These maps showed clear electron density for the acyclovir in the complex. Further refinement in XPLOR continued with simulated annealing using the slow-cooling protocol, followed by alternate cycles of

positional refinement and manual rebuilding using XtalView [20]. An initial model of acyclovir was generated using Sybyl (Tripos). Finally, the positions of acyclovir, water, and sulfate molecules were checked and corrected in Fobs À Fcalc maps. The final model has an Rfactor of 21.5% and an Rfree of 30.1%, with 43 water molecules, three sulfate ions, and the acyclovir. Luzzati plot [21] gives the best correlation between the observed and calculated data for a predicted mean  coordinate error of 0.34 A for working set. The average  B factor for main chain atoms is 39.56 A2 , whereas that 2 . B factors for water for side chain atoms is 40.45 A  molecules range from 20.73 to 55.93 A2 , with an average 2 and the average B factor for acyclovir molof 38.02 A  ecule is 32.26 A2 (Table 1). Overall description Analysis of the crystallographic structure of HsPNP:Acy complex indicates a symmetrical homotrimeric structure, with one acyclovir molecule per monomer. Each PNP monomer is folded into an a=bfold consisting of a mixed b-sheet surrounded by a-helices. Fig. 2 shows schematic drawings of the HsPNP:Acy complex.

Ser33, Arg84, His86, and S220. The second sulfatebinding site lies near Leu35 and Gly36 and is exposed to the solvent and whether it is mechanistically significant or an artifact resulting from the high sulfate concentration used to grow the crystals is not known. The third identified sulfate group makes four hydrogen bonds,  involving residues Gln144 (2.80 A) and Arg148 (2.65, ) from adjacent subunit. A previous 2.85, and 3.02 A study of BtPNP activity as a function of phosphate concentration strongly indicates the presence of a second phosphate-binding site in the enzyme that may play a regulatory role [22]. Based on this result, we propose that the third phosphate-binding site identified in the present structure is the putative second regulatory phosphate-binding site. Ligand-binding conformational changes There is a conformational change in the PNP structure when acyclovir binds in the active site. The overall change with a r.m.s.d. in the coordinates of all Ca  is 1.14 A upon superimposition of HsPNP:Acy on the PNP apoenzyme (Fig. 3). The largest movement was observed for residues 241­260, which act as a gate that opens during substrate binding. This gate is anchored near the central b-sheet at one end and near the C-terminal helix at the other end and it is responsible for controlling access to the active site. The gate movement involves a helical transformation of residues 257­265 in the transition apoenzyme complex [13,15]. Comparison of the HsPNP apoenzyme (PDB accession code: 1M73) with HsPNP complexed with immucillin-H (PDB accession code: 1PF7) also shows the gate movement and the helical transition in the same region. Based on the structure of HsPNP:Acy, native HsPNP, and HsPNP:ImmH, we confirm that the binding of ligands to mammalian PNP does not generate large movement of Lys244 side chain, nor allows hydrogen bonding between b-amino group of Lys244 and substrate, as speculated in previous reports [15,23]. Furthermore, the predicted salt-bridge between Lys244

Second phosphate regulatory-binding site The structure of HsPNP:Acy shows clear electrondensity peaks for three sulfate groups, which is present in high concentration in the crystallization experimental condition. Two of these sulfate groups have been previously identified in the low-resolution structure of human PNP [15] and one new site was identified at subunit interface in the present structure and in the structures of HsPNP [13] and HsPNP:ImmH (PDB accession code:  1PF7), solved to 2.3 and 2.6 A resolution, respectively. The first sulfate site, which is the catalytic phosphatebinding site, is positioned to form hydrogen bonds to

and Glu201 is also unlikely to occur, since it was not observed, neither in the present structure nor in the structures of HsPNP:ImmH (PDB accession code: 1PF7) and HsPNP [13]. Previously reported steady-state kinetics results on the Lys244­Ala mutant of human PNP and subsequent refinements in the low-resolution X-ray structure led to the proposal that the Lys244 side chain would be pointing away from the active site and into solvent [23]. Nevertheless, such conformation for the Lys244 side chain is not observed in the present structure and in the high-resolution structures of bovine PNP and human PNP [13]. Interactions with acyclovir The specificity and affinity between enzyme and its inhibitor depend on directional hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, as well as on shape complementarity of the contact surfaces of both partners [24­28]. The atomic coordinates of the HsPNP:Acy were used for structural comparison with the complex between HsPNP and other inhibitors. We focused our analysis on four inhibitors: acyclovir, 8-aminoguanine, 8-amino9-benzylguanine, and immucillin-H (trade name BCX1777). Values of 90, 0.8, and 0.2 lM for Ki have been determined for, respectively, acyclovir, 8-aminoguanine, and 8-amino-9-benzylguanine [11]. Immucillin-H is an inhibitor of human PNP based on the transition-state structure and exhibits slow-onset tight-binding inhibition with a rapid initial-binding phase and a KiÃ value of 72 pM [29]. Figs. 4A and B show the interactions between ImmH and acyclovir with human PNP, while interactions between 8-aminoguanine and 8-amino-9benzylguanine with HsPNP are not shown, because the atomic coordinates for these complexes are not available. Analysis of the hydrogen bonds between immucillin-H and HsPNP reveals seven hydrogen bonds, involving the residues His86, Tyr88, Glu201, Met219, Thr242, and Asn243. It has identified only four hydrogen bonds between 8-aminoguanine and the HsPNP, involving the residues Ala116, Glu201, Asn243, and Lys244. For the complex between HsPNP and 8-amino9-benzylguanine, a total of five hydrogen bonds are observed, involving the residues Glu201, Asn243, and Lys244 [11]. Acyclovir, which is a weak inhibitor of human PNP (Ki ¼ 90 lM), belongs to the class of nucleoside analogs with 9-substituent acyclic chain. Analysis of HsPNP:Acy complex shows five hydrogen bonds, all ocurring between the purine ring of acyclovir and HsPNP. These hydrogen bonds involve residues Glu201 and Asn243. Table 2 shows the hydrogen bonds between acyclovir and human PNP. The hydroxyl and ether groups of the aliphatic chain of acyclovir form no hydrogen bonds. Analysis of the four complexes of human PNP and inhibitors strongly indicates that additional binding affinity, observed for immucillin-H, may result

Furthermore, ImmH shows higher contact area with human   PNP (162 A2 ) against 136 A2 observed for acyclovir, which is consistent with the lower inhibition dissociation constant value observed for ImmH, when compared with acyclovir. The electrostatic potential surface of the acyclovir complexed with HsPNP was calculated with GRASP [30] (figure not shown). The analysis of the charge distribution of the binding pockets indicates the presence of some charge complementarity between

inhibitor and enzyme, though most of the binding pocket is hydrophobic in all structures.

Conclusions Analysis of the structure of PNP complexed with acyclovir provides important information for the structure-based design of new drugs and the improvement of already identified lead compounds. The combination of recombinant human PNP, cryocrystallographic techniques, and synchrotron radiation allowed an improvement in the resolution power of human PNP crystals, when compared with previous crystallographic studies performed using non-recombinant human PNP [11,15], and opens the possibility of obtaining new structural data for complexes between human PNP and inhibitors. These new structures will guide future development in the structure-based design of human PNP inhibitors. Ligand-induced conformational changes in the protein are difficult to predict and need to be experimentally determined. In the case of PNP, there is a large movement of residues 240­260. These residues form a gate that opens during substrate binding. The identification of a second regulatory phosphate-binding site partially explains the phosphate dependency of IC50 observed for several PNP inhibitors. The atomic coordinates and the structure factors for the complex HsPNP:Acy have been deposited in the PDB with the accession code: 1PWY.
