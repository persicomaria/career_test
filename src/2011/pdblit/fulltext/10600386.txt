The villin headpiece (HP67) is a 67 residue, monomeric protein derived from the C-terminal domain of villin. Wild-type HP67 (WT HP67) is the smallest fragment of villin that retains strong in vitro actin-binding activity. WT HP67 is made up of two subdomains, which form a tightly packed interface. The C-terminal subdomain of WT HP67, denoted HP35, is rich in helical structure, folds in isolation, and has been widely used as a model system for folding studies. In contrast, very little is known about the folding of the intact villin headpiece domain. Here, NMR, CD and H/2H amide exchange measurements are used to follow the pH, thermal and urea-induced unfolding of WT HP67 and a mutant (HP67 H41Y) in which a buried conserved histidine in the N-terminal subdomain, His41, has been mutated to Tyr. Although most small proteins display two-state equilibrium unfolding, the results presented here demonstrate that unfolding of the villin headpiece is a multistate process. The presence of a folded N-terminal subdomain is shown to stabilize the C-terminal subdomain, increasing the midpoints of the thermal and urea-induced unfolding transitions and increasing protection factors for H/2H exchange. Histidine 41 has been shown to act as a pH-dependent switch in wild-type HP67: the N-terminal subdomain is unfolded when His41 is protonated, while the C-terminal subdomain remains folded irrespective of the protonation state of His41. Mutation of His41 to Tyr eliminates the segmental pH-dependent unfolding of the headpiece. The mutation stabilizes both domains, but folding is still multistate, indicating that His41 is not solely responsible for the unusual equilibrium unfolding behavior of villin headpiece domain.

Introduction
Headpiece is an F-actin-binding motif that is found at the C terminus of a variety of multidomain actin-bundling proteins.1­4 The villin headpiece domain was the first to be discovered and is the best characterized. In isolation the domain adopts a compact globular fold rich in a-helical structure in its C-terminal half.4 The villin headpiece was originally defined by proteolytic digestion and consists of the C-terminal 76 residues of villin. The first nine residues of this domain can be removed without affecting function, stability or structure.4,5 The resulting construct is normally denoted wildtype (WT) HP67 and represents the smallest headpiece domain characterized to date that retains high-affinity actin-binding activity.

1067 residues from both subdomains. Residues in the core are highly conserved among known headpiece sequences. Additional interactions involving charged residues link the two subdomains. The C-terminal subdomain is comprised of three tightly packed helices and includes the final 35 residues of WT HP67. This subdomain is often referred to as the villin headpiece helical subdomain HP35.5,6 HP35 is stabilized, in part, by a buried cluster of three

of WT HP67 is based on the larger 76 residue villin headpiece; thus, the first residue of WT HP67 is assigned position 10. We use this system for consistency with earlier studies.4­7 WT HP67 is made up of N and C-terminal subdomains. The two subdomains pack against each other and form a well-packed interface (Figure 1). The protein forms a compact structure with an extended hydrophobic core comprising

1068 phenylalanine residues. An interesting feature in the N-terminal subdomain is the histidine located at position 41 (Figure 1). This residue is largely buried and is packed tightly in the hydrophobic core. Its side-chain makes no contacts with the C-terminal subdomain. Initial experiments suggested that this residue acts as a pH-sensitive switch for conformational transitions involving the N-terminal subdomain.4 The biological function of this switch is not known; however, a fully folded N-terminal subdomain is required for tight binding to actin and lowering intracellular pH may favor the dissembling of F-actin bundles in vivo.4,7,8 Most small proteins display two-state equilibrium unfolding and many display two-state kinetic folding as well.9 HP35 folds cooperatively and is one of the shortest naturally occurring sequences to do so.5,10,11 Its small size and high helical content are expected to promote rapid folding and this has been confirmed experimentally.10,11 HP35 is an extremely popular target for computational and theoretical studies of folding. At least a dozen groups have independently published computational or theoretical studies of its folding.12­30 In contrast, little is known about the folding of the intact 67 residue headpiece domain. Here, we characterize the equilibrium temperature, denaturant, and pH-induced unfolding of WT HP67, and demonstrate that, in contrast to HP35, folding is multistate, despite the small size and compact globular structure of WT HP67. The buried histidine at position 41 is often found in headpiece sequences but is not strictly conserved and can be replaced by tyrosine. No other substitutions have been found at this site. Consequently, we examined the effects of the histidine to tyrosine substitution on the stability and folding cooperativity of WT HP67. The mutation stabilized both subdomains, but folding is still multistate, indicating that His41 is not solely responsible for the unusual equilibrium unfolding behavior of villin headpiece domain.

hydrophobic core of the N-terminal subdomain. Populating the d-tautomer allows the imidazole ring to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide of Asp34 and the backbone carbonyl of Glu14. When the imidazole side-chain is protonated at lower pH, the N-terminal subdomain is presumed to be unfolded. Since the N-terminal subdomain unfolds during the titration, the apparent pKa does not represent the microscopic pKa of histdine 41 in either state. The end-points of the titration are instead related to the microscopic pKa values of histidine 41 in the folded and unfolded states and are consistent with a folded state pKa of 4 or lower and an unfolded state pKa near 6.31 Continuum electrostatic calculations, described in the accompanying paper,32 suggest that the nativestate pKa is strongly depressed. To provide direct evidence for pH-dependent folding, 1D NMR spectra were collected for WT HP67 at different pD values (Figure 2(a)). The NMR assignments for WT HP67 have been published.4 Well-resolved ring-current shifted methyl resonances can be observed from the N and C-terminal subdomains and this allows the pH-induced

Results and Discussion
The pH-induced segmental unfolding of HP67 is eliminated by the H41Y mutation Early studies of WT HP67 showed that the N-terminal subdomain sampled multiple conformations at pH 5.0 but became fully structured at pH 7.0.5 The observed behavior correlates with an apparent pKa of 5 derived from the midpoint of the NMR-monitored titration curve, pointing to the involvement of the single histidine at position 41.4 The actual pKa of His41 in the native state cannot be experimentally determined because the N-terminal subdomain unfolds before the titration is completed. At neutral pH, the uncharged side-chain of His41 populates the d-tautomer, as shown by the pattern of cross-peaks in the 1H­15N correlation spectrum (data not shown), and is packed in the

unfolding to be followed. At pD 7.0, both subdomains of WT HP67 are folded, as indicated by the resonance at K0.16 ppm, which arises from one of the Val50 methyl groups, and the resonance at 0.075 ppm, corresponds to one of the Val33 methyl groups. Val50 is in the C-terminal subdomain and the methyl resonance is strongly shifted due to ring current effects resulting from its close proximity to the aromatic core of the C-terminal subdomain. Thus, this peak provides a convenient marker of the state of the C-terminal subdomain. Val33 is buried in the core of the N-terminal subdomain and reports on its structural integrity. At pD 5.0 the Val50 methyl resonance is still observed at K0.16 ppm but the Val33 resonance from the N-terminal subdomain is too broad to be detected. The change in the NMR spectrum is indicative of the disruption of the N-terminal subdomain at pD 5.0. Since the apparent pKa of the unfolding transition is near 5.0, at pD 5.0, approximately half of the WT HP67 molecules should have an unfolded N-terminal subdomain.4 The broadening of the resonances results from conformational fluctuations of the N-terminal subdomain in rapid to intermediate exchange. As expected, at pD 4.1, where most molecules have an unfolded N-terminal subdomain, the ring-current shifted downfield methyl resonance of Val33 is no longer visible. To assess the hypothesized role of His41 in the pH-dependent unfolding of the N-terminal subdomain, His41 was mutated to tyrosine; position 41 is highly conserved in headpiece sequences and is always either His or Tyr. Consequently, we examined the effects of the histidine to tyrosine substitution. Replacement of His41 by Tyr does not change the structure of WT HP67 and causes only localized changes in the NMR spectrum, suggesting that structural changes are limited to minor changes in the packing of the side-chain of residue 41 (Figure 3). The 1D NMR spectra of HP67 H41Y are very similar at pD 4.2, pD 6.2 and pD 6.9, indicating that the substitution of tyrosine for histidine has eliminated the pH-induced unfolding (Figure 2). In the upfield region of the H41Y HP67 spectrum, the chemical shifts of the ring current shifted Val50 methyl proton resonance in the C-terminal subdomain and the methyl resonance from Val33 in the N-terminal subdomain do not change from pD 4.2 to pD 6.9. Thus, replacement of His41 by Tyr does eliminate the pH-dependent unfolding and the mutant remains fully folded over a much wider pH range. A folded N-terminal subdomain stabilizes the C-terminal subdomain The pH-dependent unfolding of the N-terminal subdomain allows the folding of the C-terminal subdomain to be monitored under conditions where the N-terminal subdomain is either folded or unfolded. The folding of the C-terminal subdomain in WT HP67 was also compared to the folding of the isolated C-terminal subdomain construct denoted

HP36. This construct consists of the last 35 residues of the villin headpiece plus an additional methionine at the N terminus. The additional methionine is included, because most previous studies of this subdomain made use of expressed constructs with an N-terminal methionine.4,6 Equilibrium thermal unfolding measurements were performed for HP36, WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y at pD 7.0 (Figure 4). Under these conditions, the N-terminal subdomain of WT HP67 is folded. The circular dichroism (CD) signal at 222 nm, primarily arising from helical structure, was monitored. Most of the helical structure in WT HP67 is located in the C-terminal subdomain, while the N-terminal subdomain is mainly made up of loops and turns. A four-residue helix is the only classic element of secondary structure in this region. Therefore, the CD signal at 222 nm is dominated by the three helices in the C-terminal subdomain and the CD experiments report primarily on the unfolding of this region. The equilibrium unfolding data were fit using a two-state model. The folding of WT HP67 is not two-state, but the analysis allows an apparent Tm to be objectively defined. Furthermore, the CD experiments are largely reporting on the C-terminal subdomain, which has been shown to fold by a two-state mechanism.5,10 The apparent

experiment measures the apparent stability of the C-terminal subdomain starting from a state where the N-terminal subdomain is unfolded. The CD signal at 222 nm was monitored. At pH 4.0, the apparent stability of WT HP67 is similar to that of HP36, while HP67 H41Y is more stable than both (Figure 5(a)). The midpoint, Cm, of the urea-induced unfolding transition is 3.6 M for HP36, 3.7 M for WT HP67 and 4.9 M for HP67 H41Y. The apparent free energies of unfolding in the absence of urea at pH 4.0 are 1.9 kcal molK1 for HP36, 2.0 kcal molK1 for WT HP67 and 3.5 kcal molK1 for HP67 H41Y. The m value of a urea denaturation experiment reports on the change of solvent-accessible surface area between the folded and unfolded forms.37,38 The apparent m values of HP36 and WT HP67 are similar, 0.53 and 0.54 kcal molK1 per mol, respectively, under these conditions, while the m value for HP67 H41Y is larger, 0.71 kcal molK1 per mol. This is consistent with the picture of local unfolding of the N-terminal subdomain at pH 4.0. In contrast, both subdomains of HP67 H41Y are folded at pH 4.0, explaining the larger m value. The thermodynamic data are summarized in Table 1. The data indicate that the presence of a folded N-terminal subdomain and the replacement of

midpoint of the unfolding transition Tm, is 76.0 8C for WT HP67. HP36 shows a lower melting temperature, 70.5 8C. The H41Y mutant unfolds with an apparent Tm of 86.6 8C, which is shifted more than 10 deg. C above the melting temperature of WT HP67. The higher apparent melting temperature of WT HP67 compared to HP36 indicates that the presence of the N-terminal subdomain stabilizes the C-terminal subdomain. Moreover, mutation of His to Tyr at position 41 in the N-terminal subdomain further stabilizes the C-terminal subdomain of WT HP67. The unfolding reaction was also followed by chemical denaturation. Initial experiments on the full-length protein showed that urea and guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation gave different estimates of the free energy of unfolding. This has been observed in other systems and is normally due to ionic strength effects.33­36 Subsequently, urea denaturation experiments were performed at pH 6.5 and pH 4.0 for HP36, WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y at 25 8C. At pH 4.0, the urea denaturation

His41 with Tyr41 stabilize the C-terminal subdomain at pH 4.0. At pH 6.5, both the N and C-terminal subdomains are folded in the absence of urea. HP67 H41Y exhibits the highest stability, but WT HP67 is now about 1.5 kcal molK1 more stable than HP36 (Figure 5(b)). Care should be used in interpreting the unfolding curves, because the NMR studies described below demonstrate that the equilibrium involves at least three species. These are the fully folded protein; a partially folded form populated at intermediate urea concentrations, in which the C-terminal subdomain is folded but the N-terminal subdomain is unfolded; and a state with both subdomains unfolded. Thus, the apparent free energies and m values derived from these experiments are best used as semi-quantitative parameters. Nevertheless, a folded N-terminal subdomain clearly stabilizes the C-terminal subdomain. This conclusion is rigorously confirmed by amide H/2H exchange studies described in subsequent sections. The apparent m values of WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y are virtually identical at pH 6.5, 0.60 kcal molK1 per mol as expected. The higher apparent stability of WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y compared to HP36 at pH 6.5 indicates that the interactions between the folded N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains stabilize the C-terminal subdomain. Domain-specific probes of the segmental unfolding of WT HP67 The CD-monitored unfolding experiments report primarily on the C-terminal subdomain and do not provide information at the individual residue level. To directly demonstrate that the two subdomains in WT HP67 unfold separately, thermal unfolding experiments monitored by 1D NMR were carried out for WT HP67 from 16 8C to 83 8C at pD 7.0. The chemical shift of the His41 3 proton and one of the Val50 methyl groups could be conveniently followed. His41 is located in the N-terminal subdomain, while Val50 is found within the C-terminal subdomain. Most of the transition for the Val50 methyl proton resonance can be observed (Figure 6(a)) and the complete transition curve for

Figure 6. Plots of chemical shift of WT HP67 versus temperature. (a) One of the methyl groups of Val50 in the C-terminal subdomain. (b) His41 32 1H resonance in the N-terminal subdomain. Samples were in 2H2O, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pD 7.0. pH meter readings were not corrected for isotope effect.

the His41 3 proton can be followed (Figure 6(b)). The melting curves could be fit by the standard equation describing two-state folding, although the Val50 curve does not exhibit a good post transition because of temperature limitations imposed by the NMR probe. The apparent Tm for the His41 resonance is 65 8C, while the Tm of the Val50 resonance is much higher. Because His41 is located in the N-terminal subdomain and Val50 is in the C-terminal subdomain, the different behavior clearly indicates that the two subdomains do not unfold in a single cooperative transition. The higher apparent melting temperature observed for the C-terminal subdomain indicates that it is more thermally stable than the N-terminal subdomain. Thermal unfolding of HP67 H41Y was also monitored by 1H NMR. There are no well-resolved resonances that allow the N-terminal subdomain to be followed by 1D NMR throughout the complete unfolding transition but the ring current shifted methyl resonance of Val33 can be followed until it starts to merge with the broad envelope of methyl peaks near 70 8C. The partial unfolding curves generated by monitoring this peak show that replacement of His41 by Tyr stabilizes the N-terminal subdomain. This observation is

1072 confirmed by the amide H/2H exchange studies described below. The apparent Tm of the signal due to Val33 is, however still lower than the apparent Tm of the C-terminal subdomain observed by CD. Thus, the unfolding of HP67 H41Y is not twostate. The observation directly demonstrates that the multistate unfolding of wild-type headpiece is not solely due to a histidine at position 41. Urea-induced denaturation experiments monitored by NMR were also used to characterize the unfolding of the two subdomains in WT HP67. A series of 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were collected as a function of urea concentration for an 15N-enriched sample of WT HP67. In order to observe a complete transition curve, the experiments were conducted at 35 8C. Chemical shifts of most of the amide protons change by less than 0.2 ppm from 0 M urea to 10 M urea. In addition, some spectral overlap is observed at higher urea concentrations. Fortunately, the amide protons of Thr15 and Ala49 show a larger difference in chemical shifts between the fully folded and unfolded states, and can be followed through the entire transition (Figure 7). Thr15 and Ala49 are located in the N-terminal and C-terminal subdomain, respectively; therefore, amide proton

Folding of the Villin Headpiece

chemical shifts as a function of urea concentration can be used to estimate the stability of the two subdomains. The observation that the transition monitored by Ala49 has a higher Cm value (above 7 M) than the transition monitored by Thr15 (near 4.2 M) provides additional evidence that WT HP67 unfolds segmentally and confirms that the N-terminal subdomain is less stable than the C-terminal subdomain. The data indicate that unfolding is at least three-state. Amide H/2H exchange measurements of WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y Amide exchange measurements were conducted to probe the apparent stability of the different subdomains. The observed exchange rate is used to calculate a protection factor that is related to the free energy of the opening reaction, provided that exchange occurs in the EX2 limit.39 If exchange occurs via the fully unfolded state, this free energy is equal to the free energy of unfolding. The EX2 limit requires that the closing rate (equal to the refolding rate) is fast compared to the intrinsic exchange rate for an unstructured amide group. The folding rate of HP36 was previously estimated via broadening of the 1H resonances of the Val50 methyl group and the C4 proton of Phe47 to occur on the microsecond time-scale.10 The same resonances exhibit similar temperature-dependent broadening and shifts in both WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y, indicating that folding is also rapid. Thus, amide exchange for residues in the C-terminal subdomain is well within the EX2 limit. NMR relaxation dispersion studies reported in the accompanying paper indicate that the N-terminal subdomain folds with a rate in excess of 4000 sK1 for WT HP67 and faster for HP67 H41Y. Hence, amide H/2 H exchange for residues in the N-terminal subdomain is also safely within the EX2 limit. Amide H/2H exchange experiments were performed for HP36, WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y at pD 6.5 and 25 8C under native conditions. For HP36, only four amide 1H­15N cross-peaks (Val50, Phe51, Phe58 and Leu61) were detected in the first HSQC spectrum, which was taken 10 min after the dry protein was mixed with 2H2O. The rest of the amide protons exchanged too fast to be measured. Val50, Phe51, Phe58 and Leu61 are part of the hydrophobic core of HP36 and amide exchanges at these sites are likely to monitor global unfolding. The apparent free energies calculated from the observed exchange rates for these four residues range from 2.2 kcal molK1 to 3.2 kcal molK1, which is consistent with the free energy of unfolding measured for the variant with the blocked C terminus in 2H2O at 25 8C, pD 6.5 by urea-induced denaturation, 2.8 kcal molK1 (data not shown). Protection factors for 15 additional residues, 19 in total, could be measured for WT HP67 (Figure 8(a)). The average free energy determined from amide exchange for the C-terminal subdomain of WT HP67 is

w5.3 kcal molK1. Thus, amide exchange measurements directly confirm that the presence of the N-terminal subdomain stabilizes the C-terminal subdomain. Protection factors could be measured for 22 residues in the C-terminal subdomain of HP67 H41Y (Figure 8(b)). The estimated free energy is w6.0 kcal molK1 for the C-terminal subdomain of HP67 H41Y. The increased stability of HP67 H41Y relative to WT HP67 confirms that the tyrosine substitution stabilizes the C-terminal subdomain and demonstrates that the effects of the histidine to tyrosine mutation are propagated throughout the structure, even though the side-chain makes contacts only within the N-terminal subdomain. Amide exchange studies also confirm that the N-terminal subdomain is stabilized by the H41Y mutation. Most of the N-terminal residues still exchange too rapidly at 25 8C for rates to be measured. At 25 8C, pD 6.5, only one residue in the N-terminal subdomain of WT HP67 shows protection against exchange, while for HP67 H41Y four residues in this region could be observed. Thus amide H/2H exchange experiments for WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y also were performed at 4 8C in order to slow the exchange reaction. Figure 9 shows the apparent free energies of the opening reactions versus residue number for the N-terminal

subdomain of WT HP67 (Figure 9(a)) and HP67 H41Y (Figure 9(b)) at 4 8C, pD 6.5. Protection factors could be measured for 11 residues in the N-terminal subdomain of WT HP67 and for 13 residues in the N-terminal subdomain of HP67 H41Y. Of the 11 residues that could be monitored in both proteins, eight exchange more slowly in HP67 H41Y, while three have similar rates. The average apparent free energy determined from the exchange data for the N-terminal subdomain residues of WT HP67, 3.0 kcal molK1, is around 0.5 kcal molK1 lower than the value estimated for the N-terminal subdomain of HP67 H41Y, 3.5 kcal molK1.

Conclusions
WT HP67 does not unfold in a single cooperative transition, despite its small size, compact fold, and well-packed hydrophobic core. The results presented here demonstrate that the thermal, pH and urea-induced unfolding all deviate from two-state behavior. Most small globular proteins exhibit two-state equilibrium unfolding; thus, the behavior of WT HP67 is unusual. The unfolding of the two subdomains is, however, not completely

1074 independent because a folded N-terminal subdomain stabilizes the C-terminal subdomain against both thermal and urea denaturation. The His41 to Tyr mutation stabilizes the protein and the effect of substitution is propagated throughout the structure, even though the side-chain at position 41 makes no contacts with the C-terminal subdomain. These results reinforce the conclusion that the unfolding of the two subdomains is not completely independent, i.e. the two structural units are coupled. The work presented here confirms that His41 is responsible for the segmental unfolding observed as a function of pH. These studies also demonstrate, however, that His41 cannot be solely responsible for the deviations from two-state unfolding, because multistate unfolding is observed for HP67 H41Y. The interface between the two subdomains does not appear unusual; thus, multistate unfolding likely arises from a reduced stability of the N-terminal subdomain. This conclusion also is supported by amide H/2H exchange studies that reveal significantly smaller protection factors in the N-terminal subdomain. In vivo, villin bundles and severs F-actin. Bundling activity is dependent upon F-actin binding by the headpiece domain. Is the decreased folding/unfolding cooperativity of WT HP67 relative to typical globular proteins important to biological function? The question is obviously speculative; however, WT HP67 is the smallest high affinity F-actin binding unit, while binding of HP35 is nearly undetectable,1,2 conceivably, the segmental unfolding might contribute to the control of function. Position 41 is either tyrosine or histidine in known headpiece sequences.4 Thus, the character of position 41 is maintained and can be made pH-sensitive through the use of histidine rather than tyrosine. Intact WT HP67 is folded under normal physiological conditions, arguing that direct segmental unfolding is not critical to normal function, but segmental unfolding could play a role in pH-mediated control of villin activity.4 Intracellular acidification could promote disassembly of F-actin bundles in vivo and rapid disassembly might be advantageous during apoptosis that occurs in brush border epithelia.7 HP35 is one of the fastest folding proteins characterized to date, folding on the time-scale of a few microseconds. HP35, like all other characterized very rapidly folding domains, is actually part of a larger functional protein. To date, the folding of these proteins has only been considered in isolation and not in their more relevant context as part of larger structures. The work presented here provides the thermodynamic background necessary to analyze the folding of the intact villin headpiece domain of WT HP67. Detailed NMR relaxation studies are presented in the accompanying paper. These investigations show that folding of the N-terminal subdomain is slower than the folding of HP35. Thus, acquisition of a fully functional structure must proceed at

a rate that is slower than the extremely rapid folding of the isolated C-terminal subdomain.

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation and purification HP36 was prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc-based chemistry on a ABI 433A peptide synthesizer with standard reaction cycles. The first residue linked to the resin, all b-branched amino acids, and all residues following b-branched amino acids were double coupled. PAL-PEG-PS resin was used leading to an amidated C terminus upon cleavage from the resin with 91% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 3% anisole, 3% thioanisole, 3% ethanedithiol. Amidation of the C terminus does not affect the structure although it slightly reduces the Tm.10 Purification was achieved by reversephase HPLC with 10% water, 90% acetonitrile gradients containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA on a C18 column (Vydac). The identity of the product was confirmed by mass spectrometry. WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y were prepared recombinantly, by overexpression in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown in Luria broth medium containing 100 mg mlK1 kanamycin at 37 8C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6, cells were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropylthio-b-D-galactoside) for 4 h at 37 8C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000g, resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and lysed by sonication. Centrifugation at 12,000g for 45 min was used to remove cell debris. The supernatant was loaded directly onto a Sephadex G-50 size-exclusion column and eluted with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Further purification was performed by reverse-phase HPLC with 10% water, 90% acetonitrile gradients containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA on a C18 column (Vydac). 15N-labelled WT HP67 and HP67 H41Y were expressed and purified by the same protocol, except that cells were grown in M9T minimal medium with 15NH4Cl as the main source of nitrogen. The identity of the purified products was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy All CD measurements were performed on Aviv model 62A DS and 202SF circular dichroism spectrophotometers equipped with Peltier temperature, control units. A 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer was used for all CD experiments. Standard wavelength scans were performed in a 1 mm quartz cuvette from 195 nm to 260 nm with five repeats and an averaging time of 1 s at each wavelength. Thermal denaturation and urea denaturation experiments were performed in a 1 cm cuvette by monitoring the signal at 222 nm. Thermal denaturations were carried out from 2 8C to 98 8C with a 2 deg. C interval. Urea denaturations were performed with a titrator unit interfaced to the CD spectrophotometer. All urea denaturation curves were analyzed by a non-linear least-squares procedure using SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.) to determine thermodynamic parameters: yð½ureaÞ Z an C bn ½urea C ðad C bd ½ureaÞeKDG8ð½ureaÞ=RT 1 C eKDG8ð½ureaÞ=RT (1)

spectrum took around 20 min. The spectral width was 8000 Hz in the 1H dimension and 2200 Hz in the 15N dimension. The spectra were recorded with 2048 complex data points and 64 t1 increments using eight scans per increment. The volume integrals were calculated in an automated fashion for each spectrum. Hydrogen/ deuterium exchange rates were determined by fitting the decay of cross-peak volume versus time to a first-order exponential equation. The intrinsic rate constant of exchange for each amide proton was calculated according to the SPHERE program provided by the Roder laboratory. Uncertainties in calculated free energies of the opening reaction were calculated by propagating the uncertainty derived from the fit to the plots of peak intensity versus time. Assignments of the 1H­15N HSQC spectra of wild-type and mutant were obtained by comparison of the observed chemical shifts to reported assignments and were confirmed with three-dimensional 15 N edited TOCSY-HSQC and HMQC-NOESY-HSQC correlation spectra (see Supplementary Data). Urea-dependent NMR unfolding experiments All urea-dependent unfolding experiments were carried out on a Varian 600 MHz instrument at 35 8C, pH 6.5. 15N-labeled HP67 samples were dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer with concentrations of urea ranging from 0 M to 10 M. Protein concentrations were 750 mM. 1H­15N HSQC spectra were recorded for each concentration. The spectral width was 8000 Hz in the 1H dimension and 2200 Hz in the 15N dimension. The matrix size was 4096!256 and 16 scans were acquired for each t1 increment.

where: DG8ð½ureaÞ Z DG8ðH2 OÞKm½urea (2) y([urea]) is the measured ellipticity at a certain concentration of urea. an, bn, ad, and bd, are the parameters that define the signals of the native state (N) and the denatured state (D) as a function of urea. DG8([urea]) is the free energy change for the unfolding reaction. DG8(H2O) is the Gibbs free energy for the unfolding reaction in the absence of denaturant. T is temperature and R is the gas constant. Urea concentrations were determined from the refractive index of the solution. Fraction unfolded was calculated using y([urea]), an, bn, ad, and bd. Denaturation experiments were performed in H2O and 2H2O. The 2H2O measurements were conducted to allow direct comparison with the amide H/2H exchange studies. Thermal denaturation curves were fitted to a similar expression but with DG8([urea]) replaced by DG8(T). DG8(T) is given by the Gibbs­ Helmholtz expression: DG8ðTÞ Z DH8ðTo ÞKTDS8ðTo Þ C DC8 ðTKTo C T lnðTo =TÞÞ p (3)

To is a reference temperature taken here as Tm. DH8(To) is the change in enthalpy for the unfolding reaction at the reference temperature, DS8(To) is the change in entropy, and DC8p is the change in heat capacity. The value of Tm was determined by numerical differentiation of the experimental curve. Protein concentrations were around 20 to 40 mM and were determined from absorbance measurements using the method described by Pace and co-workers.40 Temperature-dependent and pH-dependent experiments NMR experiments were conducted on either Varian Inova 500 MHz or 600 MHz NMR spectrometers. Proteins were dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 99.9% 2H2O buffer with 3,3,3-trimethylsilyl-proprionate (TSP) as a chemical shift standard to a final concentration of 1 mM. One-dimensional spectra were recorded using a standard water presaturation sequence. The spectra width was set to 6000.6 Hz. The readings of the pH meter were not corrected for isotope effect and are referred to as pD. pD-dependent experiments were performed at 25 8C. Temperature-dependent experiments were conducted at pD 7.0. The temperature of the NMR probe was calibrated using methanol below 35 8C and ethylene glycol above 35 8C. H/2H exchange measurements Spectra were recorded on a Varian Instruments Inova 600 MHz spectrometer at both 4 8C and 25 8C. Protein samples for exchange measurements were dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer and were adjusted to pH 6.5. They were frozen and lyophilized. The dry samples were dissolved in 2H2O and then transferred into the NMR tube. The pD values of all samples were measured at the beginning and the end of the experiments. The difference in pD measurements at the beginning and the end of the exchange experiments was 0.1 unit or less. A series of 1H­15N HSQC spectra were collected in order to monitor the exchange rate for each residue. The first spectrum was recorded approximately 10 to 15 min after the dissolution of the protein.
