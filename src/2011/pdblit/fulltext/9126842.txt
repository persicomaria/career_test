Base Flexibility in HIV-2 TAR RNA Mapped by Solution 15 N, 13C NMR Relaxation
Kwaku T. Dayie, Alexander S. Brodsky and James R. Williamson*
Department of Molecular Biology and the Skaggs Institute of Chemical Biology The Scripps Research Institute 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA Binding of the HIV tat protein to the TAR (transactivating response region) RNA element activates transcription of the HIV viral genome. The complex of TAR with argininamide serves as a model for the RNA conformation in the tat-TAR complex. The dynamics of the HIV-2 TAR-argininamide complex was investigated by measurements of the relaxation rates of protonated base carbon and nitrogen nuclei. Six autocorrelation rates as well as cross-correlation rates were measured to map the frequencies of base motion in the HIV-2 TAR-argininamide complex. These measurements reveal a broad range of dynamic heterogeneity exhibited by hexanucleotide loop, the dinucleotide bulge, and the A-form helical regions. U23 in the bulge undergoes the largest dynamic change on binding argininamide, while U25 remains ¯exible, re¯ecting the large conformational change that is triggered upon ligand binding.

Introduction
A recurring theme in molecular recognition is that mutual accommodation accompanies complex formation between protein and RNA or DNA surfaces.1 ± 7 Adaptive recognition is frequently associated with large-scale structural movements, which implies an important role for dynamics in ligand binding. While the view that macromolecules are inherently dynamic is not new, a number of recent observations increasingly suggest a close relationship between conformational ¯exibility and function.8 Nicholson and colleagues, for example, have shown that residues at the tips of the HIV protease protein that control entry and exit of ligands exhibit microsecond (ms) motion, and they suggest such slow motion may provide the needed ¯exibility for product release.9 Jardetzky and co-workers have similarly argued that, unlike the ¯exible wild-type that binds three operPresent addresses: K.

ator sites, a rigid mutant of the trp repressor operator binds only the trp site.10 Ogata and others have also demonstrated that relative to the wildtype, a cavity-defective mutant of the c-Myb protein has reduced ms time-scale motion. They attribute c-Myb's increased thermostability and reduced af®nity for DNA binding and transactivation to this motional defect.11 Other studies have hinted at the signi®cance of slow conformational exchange on the millisecondmicrosecond time-scale for function.12 ± 16 Equally important is the increasing appreciation of accommodating ¯exibility in computational drug design.17 ± 20 To begin to delineate how dynamics modulates the structure and function in the RNA recognition process, we report here on the dynamics of the HIV-2 TAR RNA in the absence and presence of its argininamide ligand. A number of biochemical and biophysical studies have outlined the salient features of this biologically important RNA-ligand interaction. The Tat protein binds to TAR RNA to activate HIV gene expression. Together with the host cellular proteins cyclinT and CDK9, this interaction stabilizes RNA polymerase II and enables viral replication.21 ± 24 Biochemical studies have shown that a simpli®ed argininamide-TAR complex recapitulates the essential features of the Tat-TAR interaction.21 In addition, the residues important for binding Tat, Tat peptide, or argininamide include and cluster around U23.25 ± 29 Previous biophysical

264 studies using gel electropheresis and transient electric birefrigerence (TEB) suggested a 50(Æ5)  angle introduced by the TAR bulge is straightened completely by the binding of arginine, Tat-derived peptide, and Mg2.30,31 Structurally the HIV-2 TARargininamide complex consists of a helical upper stem (G26-C29, G36-C39) that coaxially stacks on a lower stem (G16-A22, U40-C46) about a twonucleotide bulge, and this upper stem is capped with a six-nucleotide loop (C30-A35) (Figure 1).32,33 The two stems over-twist relative to each other such that G26 does not stack directly on A22. Rather, the guanidinium group stacks on A22, and in turn, U23 stacks above the guanidinium group to form an argininamide sandwich. The analysis of this high resolution NMR solution structure by Brodsky & Williamson33 provided indirect evidence that U23 forms a U23-A27.U38 base triple with a reverse Hoogsteen A27-U23 base-pair that facilitates the opening of the major groove to allow the argininamide's guanidinium group to hydrogen bond to the major groove face of G26. Until recently the direct observation of this base triple was elusive due to rapid exchange of the U23 imino proton and dynamics. Application of quantitative NMR experiments that directly detect hydrogen bonds34,35 unambiguously identi®ed the A27U23 interaction.36 Thus, TAR appears not only to undergo a large conformational change on binding its minimal ligand, but also this change appears centered on U23 (Figure 1). It is therefore of great interest to investigate how these large conformational changes are communicated to the 1H -15N and 1H-13C bond vectors within the different TAR RNA structural motifs, and how molecular ¯exibility might affect TAR's function. To this end, we use NMR relaxation measurements, since they probe some aspects of molecular motions on time-scales that range from picoseconds to milliseconds, and these time-scales of motion also overlap with functional processes.8,37 ± 42 The 15 N and 13C sites probed in this study are indicated for the four common RNA nucleotides in Figure 2. To characterize the motions in the unbound HIV-2 TAR RNA and in complex with argininamide, we report on an extensive measurement of 15N and 13 C auto-correlation43 ± 47 and cross-correlation rates.48 ± 54 These measurements enabled us to characterize the dynamic properties of the RNA-ligand complex in the free and bound state.

Results
The sequence and secondary structure of HIV-2 TAR is shown in Figure 1. Assignments of the HIV-2 TAR-argininamide complex have been reported,33 and the assignments for the uncomplexed HIV-1 RNA were reported by several groups.32,55 ± 57

The 1H-15N steady state NOE, the spin-lattice relaxation rate constant, RN(NZ) or R1, and the spin-spin relaxation rate constants, RN(NX) or R1r, were measured on a 1.5 mM labeled sample in the presence of unlabeled 6 mM argininamide at 14.1 T and temperatures of 278, 283, 288, 293, and at 298 K, and at 17.6 T and 298 K. The values of all the relaxation parameters are provided in the Supplementary Material (Table S-1). Only six imino proton resonance peaks (G17, G21, G26, G28, U38, and G43) are resolved at temperatures from 5  C to 30  C in the 1D spectrum. U40 imino resonance peak becomes observable only at 5  C in either 1D or 2D spectra. The values of the heteronuclear NOE, R1 and R1r relaxation rates for these six imino resonance peaks shown in Figure 3 indicate small variation in the relaxation rates among the different Watson-Crick base-paired nucleotides. In general, the relative magnitudes of the rates do not change at the different temperatures.

The fairly uniform values for the NOE and R1 rates suggest that the dynamic behavior of the molecule is homogeneous. However, the imino protons represent a small fraction of the possible sites that can be probed. Only cross-peaks for hydrogen bonded U or G imino proton resonances are observed, and non-hydrogen bonded bases as well as hydrogen bonded A and C residues cannot be readily probed by 15N relaxation measurements. Unfortunately the amino groups which are readily observed are poorly dispersed in chemical shift, and their relaxation behavior is more complex due to chemical exchange and the presence of a threespin system. Unlike the 15N sites in RNA, the 13C sites are more widely distributed among the different structural elements and can therefore report more extensively on the dynamic behavior in RNA than the 15N sites. Therefore, we explored the relaxation properties of 13C sites in the nucleobases to gain a better understanding of motions within different RNA structural motifs of HIV-2 TAR.

C relaxation data

For RNA, the advantage of carbon relaxation measurements is that the purine 1H-13C spin systems are not affected by carbon-carbon relaxation mechanisms, and this presents a unique opportunity to measure 1H-13C dynamics. For the pyrimidine nucleotides, relaxation of C6 is strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation due to the C5 carbon. However, it is possible to use cross-correlation measurements as one solution to this problem. Measurements are preferably made with a constant time delay because this effectively decouples the C6 resonances from the C5 residues and reduces the resulting overlap. The constant time experiments suffer from poorer signal-to-noise than the non-constant time measurements, and so

both versions of the experiment were performed. Due to resonance overlap for the pyrimidine nucleotides in TAR, the intensity of only the U23, U25, and C39 H6-C6 cross-peaks could be consistently measured while those of U38 and U40 were only accessible in non-constant-time experiments with greater signal to noise. The 1H-13C steady state NOE, the spin-lattice relaxation rate constant, RC(CZ) or R1, the spin-spin relaxation rate constant, RC(CX) or R1r, transverse antiphase, RHC(2HZCX), longitudinal two-spin order, RHC(2HZCZ), and proton longitudinal relaxation rate constants, RH(HZ), were measured for the H2-C2, H6-C6, and H8-C8 spin pairs of a uniformly 13C labeled 1.5 mM HIV-2 TAR RNA in complex with unlabeled 6 mM argininamide at 14.1T and 298 K, using established pulse sequences.44 ± 46,58 Note that the transverse rates are strictly spinlocked experiments, and there is the possibility for C-C TOCSY transfer. In a similar vein, for the steady state NOE the spin pairs H5C5 and H6-C6 are systematically affected by homonuclear C5-C6 NOE. In spite of these possible effects, the comparison of the relaxation parameters for the free and bound form of TAR can still be made. The values of all the relaxation parameters are provided in Table S-II in the Supplementary Material. The decay curves representing the R1 and R1r data for selected nucleotides are shown in Figure 4. Graphs of these relaxation rates for each nucleotide position are shown in Figure 5(a)-(e). In contrast to what is observed for the 15N sites in the RNA (Figure 3), the 13C sites display a broader range of dynamic heterogeneity (Figure 5). U25 and A35 have small transverse relaxation rates and U25, A35, and G36 have large longitudinal rates and NOE values, suggestive of fast internal

267 Cross-correlation rates The analysis of the relaxation behavior of the pyrimidine C6 carbon atoms is complicated by additional 13C-13C and 1H-1H interactions. The interaction between adjacent C5 and C6 carbon atoms can contribute signi®cantly to the R1 values and potentially alter the true value of the heteronuclear steady-state NOE.58 A possible solution is to use cross-correlation rates that, unlike the autocorrelation rates, depend exclusively on pairwise interactions and are not affected by contributions from chemical exchange. The relaxation rates for the interconversion between antiphase and inphase coherences, (RPH(PX 6 2HZPX)) and longitudinal to J-order (RPH(PZ 6 2HZPZ)) were measured using a modi®ed antiphase experiment 44,45,49,50 that selects for both inphase and antiphase components and incorporates a constant time evolution period,52,59 as well as a J-ordered experiment.54 Measurements were performed on a uniformly 13C-only and 15 N-only enriched sample of HIV-2 TAR RNA in complex with 6 mM unlabeled argininamide at 14.1 and 17.6T at 278 K and 14.1T at 298 K. The decay pro®les for the RPH(PZ 6 2HZPZ) and RPH(PX 6 2HZPX) relaxation data for selected nucleotides are shown in Figure 6. Cross-correlation effects arise from the interference between dipolar vectors (13C-1H or 15N-1H) and the corresponding anisotropy of the chemical shielding tensors (13C or 15N), and this causes the two components of the heteronuclear doublet to relax at different rates. An example of this differential line broadening for both 15N and 13C nucleotides is shown for G21 found in the lower A-helical stem (Figure 6(a) and (b)). This difference in intensities between the low and high-®eld components is much bigger for the base carbon atoms than for the base nitrogen atoms, and may re¯ect the larger magnitude of the CSA value for the base carbon atoms than for the nitrogen atoms (Figure 6). The differences between the doublets are smaller for ribose carbon atoms presumably because they have an even smaller CSA constant (data not shown). 15N relaxation parameter values for RPH(PZ 6 2HZPZ) range uniformly from 0.89-1.42 (mean  1.2Æ 0.2) sÀ1 at 14.1T and 1.02-1.34 (mean  1.2 Æ 0.1) sÀ1 at 17.6 T. Those for RPH(PX 6 2HZPX) also range uniformly from 3.065.32 (mean  4.56 Æ 0.82) sÀ1 at 1.41T and 4.95-6.38 (mean  5.9 Æ 0.6) sÀ1 at 17.6 T. 13C relaxation parameter values, on the other hand, range from 1.05-1.55 (mean  1.2 Æ 0.2) sÀ1 and 7.4-29.8 (mean  21.9 Æ 5.7) sÀ1 for the RPH(PZ 6 2HZPZ) and RPH(PX 6 2HZPX) relaxation rates, respectively, at 14.1 T. The mean is the average over all the nucleotides. Analogous to the auto-correlation relaxation parameters, both cross-correlation rates (RPH(PZ 6 2HZPZ) and RPH(PX 6 2HZPX)) are very similar for the 15N nuclei throughout the molecule. The transverse cross-correlation rates

proton longitudinal rates provide a good calibration for the effect of the dipolar relaxation of neighboring protons. Within the A-form helical regions the H2-C2 spin pairs (A20, A22, and A27) have comparably high R1 and R1r rate constants as the other A-form aromatic spin pairs such as H8C8. But unlike the H8-C8 bonds, these H2-C2 spin pairs have smaller RH(HZ) (mean value of 1.1(Æ0.2) compared to 3.6(Æ0.6)) and RHC(2HZCZ) (mean value of 2.6(Æ0.2) compared to 5.0(Æ0.6)). This observation is consistent with the relative isolation of the H2-C2 bond vectors from the rest of the RNA molecule with a concomitant low density of nearby protons. U23 has the most unusual property of possessing a fairly high NOE value, comparable to those of G36 yet much smaller than that of the very ¯exible U25, and a fairly high R1r rate constant comparable to those of nucleotides in Aform helices but smaller than that of C39. As observed for its imino resonance, the terminal G16 has relaxation rate constants that are comparable to other A-form residues, which is surprising given its position as a terminal base.

(RPH(PX 6 2HZPX)) for the 13C sites, in contrast, vary over a larger range. For instance, the dynamic behavior discussed above for the auto-correlation parameters is mirrored in the cross-correlation rates. U25 and A35 have the smallest 13C RPH(PX 6 2HZPX) rate constants consistent with very fast internal motion. The value for G36 however is comparable to those of nucleotides in Aform helices. The H2-C2 vectors have on average (except the very ¯exible A35) larger 13C RPH(PX 6 2HZPX) rates than other vectors (27.4 Æ 2.8 compared to 19.8 Æ 5.2). U23 once again has a value comparable to those in A-form helices, suggesting that it is as rigid as the nucleotides in

the helical stems. Interestingly, the terminal G16 has a cross-correlation rate constant that is smaller than those of the other A-form nucleotides. This contrasts with the auto-correlation R1r result that indicated relaxation comparable to the nucleotides in the helices. The seemingly high R1r value for G16 and U23 is, therefore, likely due to exchange broadening. In addition to providing a convenient signature for exchange, the R1r/RPH(PX 6 2HZPX) ratio is predicted to be almost independent of molecular motion, and the deviation from the average re¯ects either the differences in the magnitude of the CSA tensor or the local geometry.60,61 The ratios for the

Figure 5 (c) and (d) (legend shown on page 270)

C2 and C8 carbon atoms sites have mean values of 1.26(Æ0.1) and 1.85(Æ0.22), respectively. As is shown in Figure 7, those for C6 carbon of U23 (1.86 Æ 0.03) and U25 (2.3 Æ 1.3) are slightly larger than previously reported by Boisbouvier et al. (1.61 Æ 0.03).61 This difference for C6 carbon atoms probably re¯ects both the unusual dynamics of U23 and U25 and the large errors associated with relaxation parameters for U25. It is clear, however, that the mean values of the R1r/RPH(PX 6 2HZPX) ratios are much more different for different carbon sites than for each carbon type.

Spectral density mapping The variations in the relaxation parameters are directly related to changes in motion of the 1H-13C and 1H-15N vector bonds of the RNA. These changes in bond motion are re¯ected in the values of spectral density functions at ®ve discrete frequencies of 0, oP, oP Æ oH, oH.44,45,62 Here, oP represents the frequency of the heteroatom (P 13C or 15N) and oH the frequency of the proton (H 1H). Usually, regions of the macromolecule that are highly constrained by hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bond interactions display high

values of J(0) and J(oP), and small values of J(oH).39,40 Those parts of the molecule that lack these restraints display low values of J(0) and J(oP), and large values of J(oH). In addition, regions that undergo very rapid internal motions have unusually small values of J(0) and very large values of J(oH). Thus, a helpful ®rst step in the analysis of the relaxation data is to map the kilohertz to megahertz frequencies of motion. Here, we use both the full spectral density mapping (FSDM)44,45,63,64 and the reduced spectral density mapping (RSDM) methodology,39,40,47,65 ± 67 depending on the spin system under study. To gain a more physical understanding of the motion, one interprets the relaxation parameters in terms of a speci®c model of motion. In this step of the analysis, the LipariSzabo formalism68,69 is the most widely used. This formalism not only has an advantage of simplicity but it also requires a minimal number of assumptions. For the HIV-2 TAR-argininamide complex, the mean values for the 15N R1 and R1r provided an estimate of the overall correlation time (tm) of 8.5, 6.9, 5.9, 5.0, 4.3, and 4.2 ns at temperatures of 278, 283, 288, 293, and 298 K using the LipariSzabo formalism as implemented by Bracken et al.70 Calculations repeated with the program Tensor by Blackledge and co-workers71 ± 73 indicated that the isotropic model was adequate to describe the overall rotational motion. Given the paucity of data for both the 15N and 13C sites, to account for the partially or fully anisotropic model would necessitate overinterpretation of the data. Spectral density

mapping is a complementary approach to analyzing the raw data. We detail below our observations about the utility of this approach for both 15N and 13 C relaxation analysis in RNAs. Spectral density mapping using auto-correlation rates

N

Extensive relaxation studies on proteins have led to the observation that the J(0), J(oN), and J(oH) values, and the R1r and R1 rate constants and NOE values, respectively, are correlated.39,40,65,66,70 The relaxation rate data as interpreted using the spectral density formalism indicate that the imino resonances do not show signi®cant variation in the values of their spectral density function (data not shown). As the temperature is lowered, J(0) increases and J(oN) decreases because the overall rotational correlation time increases by a factor of approximately 1.5. Therefore, as is the case for the raw relaxation data, the values for the 15N spectral density are uniform for all the NMR observable nucleotides.

The H2-C2 spin pair is an ideal candidate for the full spectral density mapping approach, since it closely approximates an isolated two-spin system, and since there are only a few protons close to each H2 proton in a RNA A-form helix when the

sample is in 2H2O. However, when the spectral densities were calculated from the relaxation data shown in Figure 5, the J(oH) was negative for several nucleotides (Table 1). Negative values are physically meaningless for a monotonically decreasing spectral density function, and therefore it appears that the full spectral density mapping method for RNAs suffers from the same problems as noted for proteins.45,64,66,67 We anticipate that by eliminating all the nearby protons to the adenine H2s by deuteration, it should be possible to extract meaningful values of the spectral density function at high frequencies. Note however that the values of J(0) obtained are meaningful (see below). Because the full spectral mapping method does not accurately determine the J(oH) values, the reduced spectral density approach was applied to calculate the spectral densities. As discussed extensively elsewhere,47,65,66 in the reduced mapping approach only the longitudinal, transverse, and NOE relaxation parameters are needed to calculate the values of the spectral density function by assuming J(oH Æ oC) % J(oH). This assumption is certainly not justi®ed for C-H spin systems because the carbon Larmor frequency is about 25 % of the proton Larmor frequency, and so the error introduced is much more signi®cant than for an N-H spin pair. In addition, the calculation of the highfrequency values suffers from the large errors propagated from measured NOE values as seen in Table 1. The J(oC) obtained from the reduced mapping approach are systematically higher than those from the full mapping calculations due to the

assumption that J(oH Æ oC) equals J(oH), and should be interpreted with caution. The values of J(0), however, are comparable to those obtained using FSDM (Table 1). Regions of the RNA that are highly constrained by hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bond interactions display high values of J(0), whereas those parts of the molecule that lack these restraints display low values of J(0). U25, for example, has unusually small values of J(0), consistent with regions that undergo very rapid internal motions. Overall, the analysis of all the relaxation data using both 13 C and 15N probes has uncovered a large range of motion in the bound human HIV-2 TAR-arginamide complex. These differing time-scales may facilitate the binding events between the RNA and its ligand in an induced-®t manner.7 Motion in the uncomplexed and bound TAR RNA Since there is a signi®cant conformational change upon argininamide binding, it is of great interest to compare the dynamic properties of the free and the bound states of TAR. Figure 8 shows the comparison of the carbon T2 relaxation rates for both the free and bound TAR RNA. As expected, the nucleotides critical for recognition undergo signi®cant change in their T2 relaxation rates. Higher rates indicate a tightening and reduction in the high-frequency motions, which is consistent with a transition to a more ordered state. U23 undergoes the greatest change (25 %), and G26, A27, and U39 also undergo signi®cant

changes. The change in conformational restriction is not localized to the binding site but propagates to surrounding nucleotides such as G16, G17, A21, and A22. U25 has the lowest rate, is the most ¯exible residue, and does not change much in the free

form. Errors calculated using duplicate datasets were in the range of 1-4 % for both free and bound, and so these differences are signi®cant. Additionally, because the masses of the free and bound are comparable, the changes are not due to the com-

plex being heavier and rotating slower but probably re¯ect the conformational rearrangement triggered upon ligand binding. The main conformational change is con®ned to the bulged region and the major changes in the RNA dynamics also occur in this region.

Discussion
Variation of dynamic parameters within the RNA 3D structure While the NMR solution structure, representing a static picture, gives a consistent explanation of the biochemical data, the dynamics data presented herein provide further insight into the interactions between the ligand and the RNA. Most of the

nucleotides in both the lower and upper A-helical stem have uniformly high rates and values of J(0), and so these regions form a compact relatively rigid structure. Together the nucleotides A22, U23, G26, A27, and U39 also have similarly high rates and values of J(0) comparable to those in the stem, consistent with a role of forming the scaffold for the major groove binding pocket of the argininamide ligand. This corroborates the postulated argininamide sandwich between A22, U23, and the guanidinium group of the argininamide. The bulged nucleotide U25 is ¯ipped out into the minor groove making no contact with the ligand, and it has unusually small rates and values of J(0), consistent with very rapid internal motion at this site. This is in agreement with biochemical mutational data that suggested that this nucleotide acts

274 as a spacer.28,74,75 Similar dynamic behavior of spacer-like residues has been observed in DNA binding proteins GAL4 and PUT3.66,76 Of the hexanucleotide loop residues, only A35 is clearly resolved in the NMR spectra. This result may accord with the suggestion, based on biochemical data, that loop sequences are important only for transcriptional activation but not Tat (or argininamide) binding.26,27 Or it may be a consequence of being in a relatively unstructured six nucleotide loop. Despite not being embedded in a helix, the U23 is fairly rigid in the bound RNA but ¯exible in the unbound state. U25 is very ¯exible while the U23 is almost as rigid as other A-form pyrimidines. The HIV-2 TAR-argininamide structure suggests that U23 may behave as a terminal base because it is only stacking on one face similar to a terminal base-pair. U23 and terminal G16 both have high J(0) values that are comparable to those of A-form nucleotides, and from the cross-correlation experiments both nucleotides appear to be undergoing conformational exchange. Thus, U23 might indeed be behaving as a terminal base because its imino proton is dif®cult to observe, while its aromatic HC spin pair is not very ¯exible. Although the G16 imino proton resonance is observable as a very broad peak at 5  C, that of U23 is not. This behavior may therefore re¯ect partial base stacking and protection from solvent that these residues may be experiencing. While these results represent the ®rst detailed measurements of both 15N and 13C relaxation made on isotopically labeled RNA, previous studies have appeared using either 15N77 or 13C78 ± 80 only. Considering all of these reports to date, and our results, two themes emerge. First, folded RNAs display a range of conformational mobilities similar to those in proteins. Results on the free HIV-1 TAR RNA, for example, indicate U23-U25 in the trinucleotide bulge and A35 in the hexanuclotide loop have the smallest order parameter values (0.40.5) suggestive of extensive motion on the ps-ns time-scale, whereas A20 and A27 in the middle of helical stem region have large order parameters (0.8-1.0) pointing to more restricted motion.78 Similarly in the iron responsive element RNA, at 37  C bases in the loop have smaller average values of R1r (12.6 sÀ1) than those in the stem (15.4 sÀ1).79 Additionally, bases of the GÁ U pair in the UUCG tetraloop RNA hairpin are reported to be as rigid as the interior base-pairs in the stem but the 5H terminal guanine is the most mobile.77 The second theme is that residue mobilities appear to correlate with important structural and functional features. For instance, the N1-H1 of G9 but not N3-H3 of U6 in the UUCG tetraloop is involved in hydrogen bonds, and consequently G9 has a higher degree of motional restriction (the largest order parameter of 0.81). This observation is compatible with the greater thermodynamic stability and rigidity of this loop compared to the GNRA loop (where N is any nucleotide and R is a purine).77,81 In keeping

HIV-2 RNA Dynamics by NMR

with the hypothesis that the GNRA family is more ¯exible and tolerant of conformational changes than the UNCG family, the base A16 in the GAAA tetraloop of the lead-dependent ribozyme, known as leadzyme, has smaller R1r values than the helical regions, indicating rapid (ps-ns) disorder.80 In contrast A17 involved in base interactions and protected from chemical modi®cation upon RNA folding does not display this rapid disorder. In all of these studies, most of the A-form residues seem to behave similarly, and the non-helical regions exhibit a variety of dynamic behavior, especially active sites engaged in molecular recognition or catalysis.

Conclusion
We have shown that folded TAR exhibits a range of nucleotide mobilities similar to that observed in globular proteins, and that residue mobilities correlate with important structural and functional features of the RNA. TAR undergoes a conformational change on binding argininamide that results in a signi®cant rigidi®cation of the residues in the binding site. As is the case for proteins, regions of molecular dynamic heterogeneity correlate with structural elements. Nucleotides in A-form helices behave as a structural unit as is seen for protein b-sheet structures and helices, and bulged nucleotides and loop regions are relatively unrestrained as seen for protein loops and solventexposed regions. Our results agree with previous biophysical studies using TEB, X-ray, and NMR, but provide an added dynamic aspect to the view of Tat-TAR recognition. An issue that is not clearly addressed by the current study is the exact mechanism for the conformational change, the connection between the rates and the thermodynamics of recognition and binding af®nity. Hopefully the results presented here will stimulate further interest in investigating the exact mechanism of conformational ¯uctuations that mediate molecular recognition.

Materials and Methods
NMR sample preparation Two uniformly isotopically labeled samples were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase from oligonucleotide templates.82 The RNAs were puri®ed by electrophoresis on 20 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, electroeluted from the gel slices, and ethanol-precipitated. The samples were dialyzed for >48 hours against NMR buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 50 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 mM EDTA). Isotopically labeled samples were prepared as described.83 The ®nal concentrations in 500 ml were 1.5 mM and 1.5 mM for the 13Clabeled (in 2H2O) and 15N-labeled TAR RNA (in H2O) samples, respectively. The argininamide (Sigma) was titrated into the labeled RNA in the NMR tube to a ®nal concentration of 6 mM.

HIV-2 RNA Dynamics by NMR NMR spectroscopy Auto-correlation measurements
15 N NMR experiments were performed at a variety of temperatures as described in the text, on either a 600 MHz or 750 MHz Varian INOVA spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance shielded z-gradient probe. Pulse sequences for the measurement of 15N longitudinal (R1), transverse (R1r) relaxation rates and the heteronuclear NOE in NH spin systems were adapted from Dayie and Wagner.46 For the spinlocked experiments 3-3.5 kHz ®elds were typically employed with the carrier placed in the center of C6/C8 and C2 carbon and imino nitrogen regions. Suppression of the solvent resonance was achieved by 3-9-19 WATERGATE pulses.84 Both one and two-dimensional versions were performed with a recycle delay of 4.0 seconds for the R1 and R1r experiments. One-dimensional experiments were collected with 1024 real points at a sweep width of 6000 Hz with the transmitter set to the middle of the imino proton and nitrogen regions. For the 1D experiments, the longitudinal R1 experiments used relaxation delays of 10, 40, 80, 120, 240, 320, 600, and 1200 ms while the R1r experiments used relaxation delays of 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 80, and 88 ms with a spin lock radio-frequency ®eld of 3 kHz with the transmitter set to 155.27 ppm, which is between the U and G nitrogen imino chemical shifts. For the 2D experiments, longitudinal R1 experiments used relaxation delays of 10, 40, 80, 320, 640, and 1280 ms while the R1r experiments used relaxation delays of 4.02, 8.04 (2Â), 16.07, 32.14, 64.29, 80.4 ms. Two pairs of spectra were recorded for the steady-state NOE intensities. One pair involved proton saturation to achieve the steady-state intensity for four seconds, while the other pair consisted of the control spectra with no saturation to obtain the Zeeman intensity. The rate constants (RN(HZNZ) were then calculated from the ratio NOE  (gH/gN)[RN(HZNZ)/RN(NZ)]. Two-dimensional experiments were acquired with 1024 real points and 64 real points. The 1D data were processed and analyzed using VNMR software while 2D spectra were processed in nmrPipe85 and analyzed in NMRView.86 Data sets were zero-®lled once and apodized using a 90  shifted squared sine bell. Rates were ®tted by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm assuming a monoexponential decay. Error estimates were obtained using a Monte Carlo procedure described by Peng and Wagner.45 All 13C measurements were collected at 25  C on a 600 MHz Varian INOVA spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance shielded z-gradient probe. Six relaxation rate constants were measured, as outlined by Wagner and co-workers,44 ± 46 on the aromatic H-C spin systems. Longitudinal 13C relaxation rate, RC(CZ), used relaxation delays of 10.0, 40.1(3Â), 80.2, 320.66, 641.33, and 1282.66 ms. In-phase 13C transverse relaxation rate, RC(CX), measurements used relaxation delays of 4.03, 8.06 (2Â), 16.12, 24.67, 32.25, 48.36, and 64.50 ms. Measurements of transverse antiphase, RHC(2HZCX), used delays of 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 64 ms. Longitudinal two-spin order, RHC(2HZCZ), used delays of 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 400 ms. Measurement of proton longitudinal relaxation rate measurements, RH(HZ), used delays of 8, 16, 32, 64, 100, 200, and 400 ms. All these spectra were collected with a recycle delay of ®ve seconds. Heteronuclear NOE spectra recorded with proton saturation utilized a relaxation delay of three seconds, followed by a three second period of saturation, while spectra recorded

275
in the absence of saturation employed a recycle delay of six seconds. For the carbon atoms the constant-time experiments were based on the sequences reported by Yamazaki et al.58 modi®ed to incorporate WATERGATE84 for water suppression. Constant time data were collected for RC(CX), RHC(2HZCZ), and NOE relaxation rate constants. Representative ®ts are shown in Figure 4. Both full and reduced spectral densities from both 15N and 13C data are calculated as described 44,45,47,65,66 with chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) values for all the carbon atoms taken from Sitkoff & Case,87 and 100 ppm for uridine and 130 ppm for guanine imino nitrogen atoms.77

Cross-correlation measurements Two pulse sequences to measure the buildup and decay of PZ and PX from the two-spin order terms 2HZPZ and 2HZPX were applied to uniformly 13C-only and 15Nonly enriched RNA from HIV-2 TAR complexed to 6 mM argininamide. The interconversion between antiphase and inphase coherences can be measured using a modi®cation of antiphase experiment 44,45,49,50 with or without constant time.52,53,59 Incoherent effects, in the presence of cross-correlated induced motion, interconvert magnetization between inphase and antiphase coherence of the P spins with a biexponential decay.88 The transverse cross-correlation rates can be extracted from simultaneous ®ts to both build-up and decay curves;88 however, we found it more expedient to extract the rates from the intensity of the two doublet components.52,59,89 The longitudinal two-spin orders can couple to the Zeeman orders resulting in an extended Solomon equation.90,91 The longitudinal magnetization builds up or decays from the created J-ordered state. Intensity ratios of the multiplet components afford a direct and sensitive method for such measurements. The schemes using multiplet ratios have sensitivity comparable to the experiments involving auto-correlation peaks; however, doubling of peaks due to splitting from scalar coupling leads to extensive crowding, which is relieved only somewhat by spreading the resonances into a third dimension. For transverse relaxation measurements a single experiment is necessary to extract the cross-correlation rates. The ratio of the fast to slow relaxing doublets is:52 A0 expÀ2RC T RC is either RPH(PZ 6 2HZPZ) or RPH(PX 6 2HZPX); T is the total duration of the relaxation period. For the transverse experiments A0 1, whereas for the longitudinal version, because A0 T 1, the experiment is best run at a number of time-points and the cross-rates extracted using standard non-linear least-squares procedures.44,45 For the cross-correlation experiments the following delays were used for the constant time versions of the experiment: on the 600 and 750 MHz ®elds, the delays for interconverting longitudinal spin orders were 8, 16, 20, 32, 48, 60, and 80 ms; the delays for interconverting transverse spin orders were 16, 20, 24 (2Â), 28, 32, 36, and 48 ms. Each spectrum was processed using either NMRpipe 85 and subsequently analyzed in NMRView 86 or Felix 2.01 on Silicon Graphics Indy workstations. In Felix each FID was zero-®lled to 8 K, a 60  shifted sine squared function was applied prior to strip-transformation; interferograms in t1 were zero-®lled to 512 real points and a 60  shifted sine squared function applied before Fourier transformation.
