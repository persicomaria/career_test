The solution structure of the (2S,3S)-N6-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)-2-deoxyadenosyl adduct arising from the alkylation of adenine N6 at position X6 in d(CGGACXAGAAG),d(CTTCTTGTCCG), by butadiene diol epoxide, was determined. This oligodeoxynucleotide contains codon 61 (underlined) of the human N-ras protooncogene. This oligodeoxynucleotide, containing the adenine N6 adduct butadiene triol (BDT) adduct at the second position of codon 61, was named the ras61 S,S-BDT(61,2) adduct. NMR spectroscopy revealed modest structural perturbations localized to the site of adduction at X6,T17, and its nearest-neighbor base pairs C5,G18 and A7,T16. All sequential NOE connectivities arising from DNA protons were observed. Torsion angle analysis from COSY data suggested that the deoxyribose sugar at X6 remained in the C2-endo conformation. Molecular dynamics calculations using a simulated annealing protocol restrained by a total of 442 NOEderived distances and J coupling-derived torsion angles refined structures in which the BDT moiety oriented in the major groove. Relaxation matrix analysis suggested hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group located at the -carbon of the BDT moiety and the T17 O4 of the modified base pair X6,T17. The minimal perturbation of DNA induced by this major groove adduct correlated with its facile bypass by three Escherichia coli DNA polymerases in vitro and its weak mutagenicity [Carmical, J. R., Nechev, L. V., Harris, C. M., Harris, T. M., and Lloyd, R. S. (2000) Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 35, 48-56]. Overall, the structure of this adduct is consistent with an emerging pattern in which major groove adenine N6 alkylation products of styrene and butadiene oxides that do not strongly perturb DNA structure are not strongly mutagenic.

United States. It is a combustion product from automobile emissions (3) and cigarette smoke (4). BD is genotoxic and is a carcinogen in rodents, particularly in mice (57), and also in rats (8). Recently, BD was classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as "carcinogenic to humans by inhalation" (9). The International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) lists BD as a "probable human carcinogen" (group 2A) (10). Chronic human exposure in the SBR industry may induce geno-

toxic effects (11-13) and is correlated with an increased risk for leukemia (1, 14-22). BD is epoxidized primarily by cytochrome P450 2E1, but also by cytochrome P450 2A6, to form BDOs (Scheme 1) (23, 24). These may be further oxidized by cytochrome P450 2E1 or 3A4 to form BDO2s (23, 25-29). Hydrolysis of BDO mediated by epoxide hydrolase forms 1,2-dihydroxy-3-butenes (27, 30, 31), which are metabolized by cytochrome P450 to hydroxymethylvinyl ketone (HMVK) (32). Either BDO2 or the 1,2-dihydroxy-3-butenes undergo cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation to form 1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-epoxybutanes (BDE) (27, 30, 33). Thus, proximate electrophiles arising from BD metabolism include BDO, BDO2, BDE, and potentially, HMVK (34). Of these species, BDO2 is highly genotoxic (2, 10, 35), probably due to its potential to form DNA-DNA and DNA-protein cross-links, which were observed in mice (36, 37). The greater sensitivity of mice than rats upon exposure to BD is attributed to their efficient oxidation of BD to BDO2 (38, 39). BDO and BDE are less genotoxic (35, 40, 41); however, BDE is of particular concern because it may represent the most abundant metabolite of BD produced in humans (42). The reaction of DNA with BDE (42, 43) leads to the formation of trihydroxy (BDT) adducts. These represent the most prevalent adducts isolated from humans (44, 45) and also from rodents exposed to BD (42, 46, 47). While BDT adducts at N7-dG predominate (42, 46), there is considerable interest in BDT adducts at other sites in DNA, particularly dA (48-50). The BDT dA-N1 adduct was identified in humans exposed occupationally to BD (51). The dA-N6 BDT adduct was identified in Chinese hamster ovary cells (52). The latter likely results from Dimroth rearrangement of the corresponding dA-N1 adduct (53, 54), as opposed to direct alkylation at dAN6. Analogous chemistry was described for the reactions of styrene oxide with adenine N1 (55, 56). In the present work, the (2S,3S)-N6-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)-2-deoxyadenosyl adenine N6 BDT adduct was site specifically incorporated into the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (57). The resulting modified oligodeoxynucleotide, 5-d(CGGACXAGAAG)-3,5-d(CTTCTTGTCCG)-3, contained the N6-dA BDT adduct at the second position of codon 61 (Scheme 2). This was named the dA N6 S,SBDT-(61,2) lesion. Structural refinement from NMR data demonstrates that the S,S-BDT-(61,2) moiety is located

in the major groove and causes minimal localized structural perturbation. A series of rMD calculations suggest that the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct is stabilized by the formation of a hydrogen bond between the -hydoxyl group of the BDT moiety and the T17 O4. The results of bacterial site specific mutagenesis experiments using this S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct revealed low levels of A f C transversions (58). Earlier studies showed that adenine N6 adducts of R- (59-61) and -styrene oxide (62) in the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (63) also oriented in the major groove of the DNA with minor structural perturbation and were weakly mutagenic. The combined results suggest that the major groove monodentate adenine N6 adducts of styrene and BD are weakly mutagenic.

Materials and Methods
Oligodeoxynucleotide Synthesis. The unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) and purified by anion exchange chromatography. The concentration of the single-stranded unmodified oligonucleotide (57) was determined from the extinction coefficient of 9.08 × 104 cm-1 at 260 nm (64). An excess of unmodified strand was combined with the S,S-BDT-(61,2) modified strand, in a buffer consisting of 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA at pH 7.0. The solution was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The resulting mixture of single-stranded and duplex DNA was equilibrated in 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA at pH 7.0 on a column containing DNA Grade Biogel hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). The DNA was eluted off of the hydroxylapatite with a gradient from 10 to 200 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, to separate excess single-stranded from duplex DNA. The duplex was lyophilized, resuspended in 1 mL of H2O, and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column. The sample was lyophilized. NMR Spectroscopy. The S,S-BDT-(61,2) modified duplex was prepared at a concentration of 2 mM. For observation of nonexchangeable protons, the sample was dissolved in 0.5 mL of 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA at pH 7.0. The sample was exchanged three times with 99.9% D2O and dissolved in 99.96% D2O. For observation of exchangeable protons, the sample was dissolved in 0.5 mL of 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA at pH 7.0. The sample

was lyophilized and suspended in 0.5 mL of 9:1 H2O/D2O. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 800.23 MHz. The temperature was controlled at 20 ( 0.5 °C for the observation of exchangeable and nonexchangeable protons. Chemical shifts were referenced to the water resonance at 4.71 ppm at 20 °C. NOESY and DQF-COSY experiments were performed at a frequency of 800.23 MHz. Phase sensitive NOESY spectra used for resonance assignment were recorded using TPPI phase cycling with mixing times of 150, 200, and 250 ms. For examination of exchangeable protons, phase sensitive NOESY were carried out using a field gradient Watergate pulse sequence for water suppression (65). The spectra were recorded at 20 °C and 150 ms. These experiments were recorded with 1024 real data points in the d1 dimension and 2048 real data points in the d2 dimension. A relaxation delay of 2.0 s was used. To derive distance restraints, NOESY spectra were recorded at mixing times of 150, 200, and 250 ms. A TOCSY experiment was performed at a frequency of 800.23 MHz with mixing times of 90 and 150 ms, utilizing the homonuclear Hartman-Hahn transfer with MLEV17 sequence for mixing. Data from the TOCSY spectrum allowed for the assignment of the BD protons via bond magnetization transfer and allowed for the observance of all BD protons in the aliphatic chain. The NMR data were processed using FELIX (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA) on an Octane workstation (Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The data in the d1 dimension were zero-filled to give a matrix of 1024 × 2048 real points. A skewed sine-bell square apodization function with a 90° phase shift and a skew factor of 1.0 was used in both dimensions. rMD Calculations. Calculations were performed using XPLOR (66). The force field was derived from CHARMM (67) and adapted for rMD calculations for nucleic acids. Classical A-DNA and B-DNA were used as the reference structures to create starting structures for the refinement (68). The BD adduct was constructed at the sixth position using the BUILDER module of INSIGHT II (Accelrys, Inc.). The A and B structures were energy-minimized by the conjugate gradients method for 200 iterations without experimental restraints to give starting IniA and IniB used for the subsequent relaxation matrix analysis and molecular dynamics calculations. Footprints were drawn around the NOE cross-peak for the NOESY spectrum measured with a mixing time of 250 ms to define the size and the shape of the individual cross-peak using FELIX. The same set of footprints was applied to spectra measured with the two other mixing times. Cross-peak intensities were determined by integrating the volume of the areas under the footprints. The intensities were combined as necessary with intensities generated from complete relaxation matrix analysis of a starting DNA structure to generate two hybrid intensity matrixes using

correlation times of 2, 3, and 4 ns yielded 18 sets of distances. These data were pooled; the average values of all minimum and maximum distances were used in setting error bounds to give the experimental NOE restraints used in subsequent molecular dynamics calculations (71). These distance restraints were divided into classes on the basis of the confidence factor obtained from them. The program X-PLOR was used for energy minimization and rMD calculations (66). The calculations were based on an energy function approach where the total energy was the sum of the empirical energy of the molecule and the effective energy, comprised of the restraint energy terms. The CHARMM force field was utilized, which provided the terms for the bonds, bond angles, torsion angles, tetrahedral and planar geometry, hydrogen bonding, and nonbonding interactions, including van der Waals and electrostatic forces. The electrostatic term used the Coulombic function based on a reduced charge set of partial charges and a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4.0, to mimic solvent screening of charge. The van der Waals term was approximated using the Lennard-Jones potential energy function. The effective energy function was comprised of two terms describing distances and dihedral restraints, both of which were in the form of a standard square-well potential (72). Bond lengths involving hydrogens were fixed with the SHAKE algorithm (73) during molecular dynamics calculations. These calculations were all performed in vacuo. The simulated annealing procedure consisted of a total of 50 ps of rMD. The protocol consisted of 30 ps of high-temperature rMD, 5 ps of cooling, and 15 ps of low-temperature rMD. The high temperature was 2500 K, and the low temperature was 300 K. The temperature was controlled by coupling the molecules to a temperature bath with a coupling constant of 0.05 ps (74). Ten structures were calculated from each starting structure, each being assigned a different random seed for the generation of the initial atomic velocity vectors. The rMD calculations were initialized by assigning a random set of velocities to all of the atoms that fit a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 2500 K. The rMD calculations were carried out for 3000 steps at 2500 K, then cooled to 300 K over 5000 steps, and continued at 300 K for an additional 15 000 steps. An initial force constant of 50.0 kcal mol-1 was used for class 1 distance restraints. Throughout the rMD calculation, the force constants for classes 2, 3, 4, and 5 were set to 90, 80, 70, and 60%, respectively, of the value for class 1. The initial value of the force constant for the base-pairing restraints was set at 50.0 kcal mol-1. The force constants were maintained at the initial value for the first 10 000 steps of the rMD calculations; class 1 force constants were increased to 200 kcal mol-1, and basepairing force constants were increased to 150 kcal mol-1 over the next 10 000 steps. The force constants were maintained for 17 000 steps, scaled down to 70 and 50 kcal mol-1 for class 1 and base-pairing restraints, respectively, over 3000 steps, and

remained at these values for the final 10 000 steps of the rMD calculations. Structure coordinates were archived every 0.1 ps over the final 10 ps of the rMD simulation. Structure coordinates extracted from the final 4 ps of each rMD calculation were averaged and energy-minimized for 200 iterations using a conjugate gradients algorithm. The final refined structure was obtained by minimizing the averaged structure generated from 10 structures from two rMD calculations, five from an A form starting structure, iniA, and five from a B form starting structure, iniB. Back calculation of NMR data was performed using CORMA (75) on the final refined structure resulting in an R1x of 0.12.

Assignments of Nonexchangeable DNA Protons. The sequential assignment for the S,S-BDT-(61,2) duplex was accomplished using standard protocols (76, 77). The sequential NOEs were uninterrupted in both the modi-

fied and the unmodified strands of the duplex. A contour plot of the NOESY spectrum collected at a mixing time of 250 ms is shown in Figure 1. The complete assignment of the deoxyribose H2, H2, H3, and H4 protons was achieved. Because of overlap, partial assignments were made for the deoxyribose H5 and H5 protons. The spectrum was similar to that of the unmodified ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (63), suggesting that the presence of the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct had minimal effect on the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide. Assignments of Exchangeable DNA Protons. The assignments for the base imino protons were made at 5 °C (78) (Figure 2). The thymine imino protons, T13 N3H

and T14 N3H, resonated at 14.3 and 13.78 ppm. T16 N3H and T17 N3H cross-peaks were observable at 13.53 and 13.54 ppm. T19 N3H resonated at 13.71 ppm. The imino resonances from G2, G3, G8, G11, and G18 were individually resolved. The nonhydrogen-bonded amino resonance of C5, the base 5 to the adducted nucleotide, resonated at 6.73 ppm, while the hydrogen-bonded resonance was located at 8.21 ppm. G18 showed an NOE to T17 N3H, indicating that the modified base pair X6,T17 was intact. The spectrum was also similar to that of the unmodified ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (63), suggesting that the presence of the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct had minimal effect on the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide.

BDT Protons. The BDT protons were observed between 3.4 and 4.0 ppm. The HR and HR protons were observed at  3.10 and  3.74 ppm, respectively. The difference in chemical shift between the two protons reflects the difference in chemical shift environments. The H proton was observed at  3.95 ppm. The H proton was observed at  3.93 ppm. The H and H protons were observed at  3.64 and  3.62 ppm. The stereotopic assignment2 of the HR,R and H, proton resonances were elucidated by analysis of 3J coupling constants and NOE intensities, the latter in comparison with predicted intensities generated by complete relaxation matrix analysis (75). NOE Connectivities between BDT and DNA. Table 1 tabulates cross-peaks observed between BDT protons and DNA. A total of 18 NOEs were observed between BDT and X6, its adducted base, as well as its base-paired T17. NOEs between the T17 N3H and the BDT protons were observed in the 1H NOESY spectrum. The BDT protons HR and H displayed a NOE to H6 of the adjacent 5 neighboring cytosine. No NOE was observed between BDT HR and either C5 H5 or H6 of the 5 neighboring cytosine, thereby distinguishing between HR and HR. Similarly, a different set of NOEs was observed for H and H, with the H showing a strong cross-peak to T16 N3H and a weaker cross-peak to T17 N3H, whereas the

H did not exhibit these NOEs. The NOEs between BDT and DNA protons established the orientation of the BDT moiety. Torsion Angle Restraints. A series of 1H DQF-COSY and E-COSY experiments showed that all of the deoxyribose sugars in the S,S-BDT-(61,2) oligodeoxynucleotide existed predominantly in the C2-endo conformation, characteristic of a B type DNA helix (79). The 31P spectrum showed no unusual chemical shifts, suggesting that the phosphodiester backbone was not significantly perturbed by the presence of the S,S-BDT moiety. This observation was confirmed by a 1H-31P HMBC experiment using an IBURP-shaped pulse (80) in the 1H dimension. The 3J couplings between H3 and 31P were consistent with backbone torsion angles in the normal range for B type duplexes (81). The glycosyl torsion angles of all nucleotides were examined using 1H NOESY experiments. These revealed weak NOEs between the purine H8 or pyrimidine H6 protons and the anomeric H1 protons of the attached deoxyribose sugars, consistent with glycosyl torsion angles in the anti conformational range, also consistent with a B form helix (82). Chemical Shift Effects. Small chemical shift perturbations were observed when the ras61 S,S-BDT-(61,2) oligodeoxynucleotide was compared to the unmodified ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (63). Figure 5 shows the chemical shift perturbations for the nucleobase aromatic protons. The observed chemical shifts were clustered at the modified base pair X6,T17 and its nearest neighbor base pairs in either direction, C5,G18 and A7,T16. The largest of these was on the order of 0.1 ppm, suggesting

that the S,S-BDT adduct introduced only minimal perturbation to the magnetic field environment at and adjacent to the lesion site. The remainder of the base pairs in the S,S-BDT-(61,2) oligodeoxynucleotide showed essentially no chemical shift perturbations as compared to the unmodified ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide. rMD Calculations. The NOE and torsion angle data were used to restrain a series of molecular dynamics calculations. These rMD calculations employed a simulated annealing protocol. They incorporated 442 NOEbased distance restraints, including 18 between BDT protons and DNA protons. An additional 90 pseudorotation and 62 phosphodiester backbone angle measurements were also included. The orientations of the hydroxyl groups at the - and -carbons were of particular interest. Initial rMD calculations predicted that the -hydroxyl would be approximately 2 Å from T17 O4, suggesting the potential for formation of a hydrogen

bond. Consequently, it was decided to initiate a second series of rMD calculations in which an additional hydrogen-bonding restraint was incorporated between the -hydroxyl proton and the T17 O4. Figure 6 shows a stereoview of an ensemble of six structures that emerged from six randomly seeded rMD calculations including this hydrogen-bonding restraint. Table 1 details the structural refinement parameters. These calculations were initiated using both B form DNA and A form DNA starting structures. The structures that emerged from the simulated annealing protocol converged with a rmsd of <1 Å, irrespective of starting structure. This suggested that the restraints used to drive the simulated annealing protocol were allowing structural convergence, irrespective of starting structure. The rMD calculations predicted that the overall conformation of the duplex was more similar to B form DNA than A form DNA. This was evidenced by a rmsd of 1.25 Å

accommodated within the major groove of the duplex. The  and  carbons of the BDT moiety extend into the major groove of the DNA and do not interfere with overall basestacking interactions at the lesion site. Consequently, the S,S-BDT moiety is adjacent to the major groove face of the modified nucleotide X6. The major groove location of the BDT moiety resulted in minimal perturbations to base-stacking interactions at the lesion site, as shown in Figure 9, in which the base-stacking patterns of the adducted oligonucleotide are compared with those of the corresponding unmodified ras61 oligonucleotide. In the modified strand, the presence of the adduct results in improved pyrimidine-purine stacking between C5 and X6 but poorer purine-purine stacking in the 3-direction, between X6 and A7. Only small changes in base-base stacking were noted in the complementary strand. At base pair X6,T17, the potential for T17 O4 to simultaneously form hydrogen bonds to both the X6 N6H and the -hydroxy group of the BDT moiety is evident.

Discussion
This work provides the first solution structure of an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex modified site specifically and stereospecifically with BDE, the S,S-BDT-(61,2) oligodeoxynucleotide. BDT adducts are of significance because BDE may represent the most abundant electrophile arising from human metabolism of BD (42). Indeed, the BDT adenine N1 adduct has been identified in human cells (51). The adenine N6 adduct examined in this work might arise as a consequence of Dimroth rearrangement of the initially formed N1 adduct (53, 54). Structural Analysis. The key feature of the S,S-BDT(61,2) oligodeoxynucleotide structure was the accommodation of the BDT moiety within the major groove of the DNA with minor overall perturbation of the DNA duplex. This conclusion was supported by a number of lines of evidence obtained from NMR spectroscopic data. The observation of specific NOEs between BDT protons and both of the neighboring C5,G18 and A7,T16 base pairs oriented the BDT moiety in the major groove and indicated that the BDT moiety was positioned such that it was proximate to both neighboring base pairs, as opposed to being oriented in either the 5- or 3-direction from the site of adduction. The sequential NOE connectivity between adjacent base pairs was maintained (Figure 1) as was the sequential NOE connectivity between Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded bases (Figure 2). This was consistent with the conclusion that the presence of the BDT moiety in the major groove resulted in minimal perturbation to the overall conformation of the DNA duplex. The NOE results were corroborated by chemical shift analysis. The 1H-31P HMBC experiments showed minimal 31P chemical shift differences as compared to the unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide, data that were consistent with the prediction that there were no major distortions in the phosphodiester torsion angles. Analysis of 1H chemical shift data also led to the conclusion that only minor changes in base stacking occurred as a result of adduct formation at nucleotide X6 (Figure 5). The minor differences in base stacking at the lesion site as predicted by rMD calculations (Figure 9) were consistent with the lack of observation of significant 1H chemical shift changes. The rMD calculations predicted the potential for hydrogen bond formation between the OH group at the

between the B form starting structure and the average structure, whereas the rmsd between the A form starting structure and the average structure was 5.7 Å. Complete Relaxation Matrix Calculations. The accuracies of structures emergent from the rMD calculations with respect to the experimental NOE data were assessed by complete relaxation matrix calculations using the program CORMA (75). These calculations yielded a R1x between the NOE intensities predicted by the refined structures and the experimentally measured NOE intensities. Two sets of CORMA calculations were performed. The first calculation utilized a structure that did not contain a restraint for the hydrogen bond between the -hydroxyl proton and the T17 O4. The second calculation utilized a structure that was calculated with an additional restraint for this hydrogen bond. The R1x values from both calculations were compared, and the lower value resulted from the second calculation that included the hydrogen bond restraint, 0.90 × 10-1 and 0.76 × 10-1, respectively. The reduced R1x value supports the conclusion that a hydrogen bond may exist between the adduct proton and the T17 O4. Figure 7 shows R1x values as a function of position in the S,S-BDT-(61,2) oligonucleotide. The results were consistently < 0.10 for each nucleotide, indicating good agreement between the calculated NOE intensities and the actual NOE intensities. Refined Structure. Figure 8 shows a CPK model of the average structure emergent from the simulated annealing protocol. The S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct was readily

-carbon of the BDT moiety and the T17 O4, the thymine complementary to the damaged deoxyadenosine. Although it was not possible to observe this hydrogen bond in the NMR spectrum, probably due to the fact that the hydrogen-bonded proton exchanges rapidly with solvent, NMR data were consistent with the formation of this hydrogen-bonding interaction. The 1H spectrum for the BDT spin system shown in Figure 3 indicated discrete resonances for each BDT proton; moreover, these resonances had line widths comparable to the other DNA proton resonances. This observation was consistent with the notion that the BDT moiety was stabilized in a discrete conformation, as would be predicted by the presence of a hydrogen bond between the -hydroxyl and the T17 O4. A computational approach was also used to evaluate the potential for formation of this hydrogenbonding interaction. A series of complete relaxation matrix calculations (75) conducted on structures refined using restraints that either did or did not include this hydrogen-bonding restraint showed substantial improvement in R1x as compared to experimentally obtained NOE intensities, when this hydrogen bond was included. This result predicted that a measurable population of adduct structures containing this hydrogen bond existed in solution. It was interesting to note that T17 O4 was also expected to participate in the usual Watson-Crick hydrogen bond involving X6 N6H, the amino proton located at the site of adduction. The observation of the imino proton resonance T17 N3H in the usual region of

the far downfield 1H NMR spectrum was consistent with the conclusion that the adducted base pair X6,T17 existed in the expected Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded configuration. Thus, it appeared that T17 O4 simultaneously participated in a bifurcated hydrogen bond involving both the -OH group of the BDT moiety and the X6 amino proton. An alternative possibility is that there was rapid exchange between these two hydrogen bonds. Comparisons with Other Adenine N6 Adducts. In the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide, the adenine N6 adducts of sterically small nonintercalating alkylating agents were generally readily accommodated within the major groove without major perturbation to DNA structure (62). The present finding that the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct was located in the major groove and caused only localized structural perturbation was consistent with this pattern. Figure 10 shows the structure of the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct studied in this work, in comparison with three similar adducts located at the (61,2) position of the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide: the S- -(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adduct (62), the S-R-(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adduct (59, 61), and the R-R-(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adduct (60, 61). In all instances, these adducts were readily accommodated within the major groove of the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide, at the (61,2) position. With the exception of the R-R-(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adduct (60, 61, 83, 84), each of these adducts was readily bypassed by polymerases in vitro (58, 83, 85) and was weakly mutagenic or nonmutagenic in Escherichia coli (58, 84, 85).

Figure 10. Comparison of the ras61 S,S-BDT-(61,2) oligodeoxynucleotide adduct with three other adenine N6 ras61 (61,2) adducts. In all panels, the DNA duplex is shown in blue, the respective DNA adduct is shown in red, and the adduct protons are shown in white. (A) The ras61 S,S-BDT-(61,2) oligodeoxynucleotide adduct (this work). This adduct is readily bypassed and is weakly mutagenic. (B) The S- -(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adduct (62). This adduct is readily bypassed and is nonmutagenic (85). (C) The S-R-(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adduct (59). This adduct is readily bypassed and weakly mutagenic (83, 84). (D) The R-R-(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adduct (60). This adduct blocks replication and is nonmutagenic (83, 84).

The R-R-(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adduct oriented toward the 5-direction (60, 61) was nonmutagenic in E. coli (84) and strongly blocked lesion bypass in vitro (83), perhaps accounting for its apparent lack of mutagenicity in the bacterial system. As may be observed in Figure 10, the orientation of this adduct in the 5-direction created a steric clash with the 5 neighbor C5,G18 base pair in the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide, which perhaps interfered with trans-lesion replication. In this regard, it was of interest to note that repositioning the R-R-(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adduct to the (61,3) position of the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (thus changing the 5 neighbor base pair to A6,T17) (59, 61), removed the block to lesion bypass in vitro (83) and that adduct was also weakly mutagenic in E. coli (84). Alkylation of adenine N6 by the carbon of styrene oxide placed the phenyl ring of the styrene oxide adduct further out into the major groove of the DNA. Consequently, the effects of R- vs S-stereochemistry were muted for the two -R(61,2) and -S (61,2) adducts, which exhibited similar conformations (62) and were not particularly mutagenic (85). The minor structural perturbation introduced into the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide by the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct contrasted with greater structural perturbations introduced into this oligodeoxynucleotide duplex by the planar aromatic adenine N6 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts such as those arising from diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene (86, 87) and benz[a]anthracene (88, 89). A

number of PAH-derived adenine N6 adducts have been studied in additional sequence contexts, and the reader is referred to an excellent review by Geacintov (90). The conformations of PAH adducts at adenine N6 were influenced by stereochemistry at the site of adduction. Those adducts having R-stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon were oriented toward the 5-direction from the adduct site. Adducts having S-stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon oriented in the 3-direction from the site of adduction. The planar aromatic PAH adducts preferred to intercalate into the DNA duplex, but their ability to do so was strongly modulated by the topology of the fused aromatic rings. This was particularly notable for the PAH adducts having the S-configuration at the benzylic carbon, which often formed disordered conformations in DNA, generally attributed to unfavorable steric interactions between the DNA duplex and the polycyclic aromatic rings. In general, PAH adducts exhibited higher mutation frequencies than did the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct (88, 91, 92). DNA Polymerase Bypass Experiments in Vitro. When ligated into 85-mer templates and examined as to trans-lesion replication in vitro, the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct did not block translesion replication by the E. coli polymerases Klenow fragment exo-, polymerase II, or polymerase III (58). All of these polymerases successfully bypassed this adduct with little or no loss of efficiency or fidelity. The structural analysis of the S,S-BDT-(61,2)

adduct that revealed only minor perturbations induced into duplex DNA by this adduct, and the polymerase bypass experiments that revealed facile bypass of the adduct appeared to be correlated. The combined results suggested that DNA replication in E. coli was relatively unperturbed by this adduct and hinted that this adduct should be weakly mutagenic in the bacterial system. Site Specific Mutagenesis. The ras61 S,S-BDT(61,2) adduct was ligated into the single-stranded vector M13mp7L2 (93) that was subsequently used to transfect repair deficient AB2480 (uvrA-, recA-) and SOS proficient AB1157 E. coli. The S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct did not result in a significant block to the replication of site specifically modified bacteriophage in vivo, as evidenced by no decrease in plaque-forming ability of phage-infected bacteria. This observation was consistent with the results of replication studies carried out in vitro, indicating that all three primary DNA polymerases in E. coli readily bypassed this adduct (58). Site specific mutagenesis experiments confirmed the prediction that this adduct should be weakly mutagenic. In both cell lines, using a differential hybridization protocol (84, 94, 95), few mutations were observed, suggesting that in these repair deficient bacterial cells, the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct was not significantly mutagenic (58). The low levels of mutations that were observed, exhibiting a mutation frequency of 0.25%, were A f C transversions. It was noteworthy that the corresponding R,R-BDT-(61,2) lesion at adenine N6 elicited a different mutational spectrum. The R,RBDT-(61,2) lesion yielded primarily A f G transitions (0.14%) (58). Thus, while neither the S,S-BDT-(61,2) nor the R,R-BDT-(61,2) adducts was strongly mutagenic, those mutations that did occur appeared to be dependent upon adduct stereochemistry. Biological Implications. Mammalian mutagenesis studies have been carried out with BD using B6C3F1 lacI transgenic mice. The mutational spectrum showed point mutations at both dG and dA; the adenine specific mutations were primarily A f T transversions (96-100), although A f G transitions were reported in H-ras codon 61 (101). The observation that the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct was weakly mutagenic and induced low levels of A f C transversions (58) suggested that it did not account for the BD-induced A f T transversions (96-100). The minor structural perturbation introduced into DNA by the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct correlated with its low level of mutagenicity in the bacterial site specific mutagenesis system (58). It also correlated with low levels of mutagenicity for adenine N6 R- (84) and -styrene adducts (85). Because site specific mutagenesis studies in bacteria (58) suggested that the S,S-BDT-(61,2) adduct does not generate A f T transversions (96-100), there has been speculation that the adenine N1 adducts may instead be responsible. These are believed to be progenitors of the adenine N6 adducts, via Dimroth rearrangement (53, 54). In contrast to the adenine N6 adducts, adenine N1 adducts are expected to interfere with Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding and introduce greater perturbation into duplex DNA; thus, it seems likely that they would be potent genotoxins. The N1 adduct can also undergo deamination to the N1-deoxyinosine adduct. Site specific mutagenesis studies of the N1-deoxyinosine adduct arising from BDO in the COS-7 system revealed that it was indeed highly mutagenic and yielded A f G mutations (102, 103). This observation led to the proposal (102) that the N1 adducts may represent the source of H-ras specific

A f G mutations observed in vivo (101). Consequently, the specific DNA adduct arising from exposure to BD and responsible for inducing A f T transversions (96-100) remains to be determined. It has been proposed that A f T transversions might result from misincorporation of dA opposite apurinic sites formed by depurination of adenine N3 adducts (104). DNA cross-links arising from bis-alkylation of deoxyadenosine by BDO2 may also prove to be significant sources of BD-mediated genotoxicity (105). BDO2 is highly mutagenic (35, 40, 41), and BDO2-treated cells showed large deletions (106). DNA-DNA and DNAprotein cross-links were observed in mice treated with BD (36, 37), and a guanine N7-guanine N7 cross-link was isolated from salmon sperm DNA (107). Site specific mutagenesis studies have been carried out on intrastrand R,R-BDO2 and S,S-BDO2 adenine N6-adenine N6 crosslinked adducts, and these yielded high levels of mutations in the COS-7 system (102). Similarly, guanine N2guanine N2 cross-links were mutagenic and induced both single base deletions and deletions (108). Structural studies on these additional BD alkylation products of deoxyadenosine are in progress.
