X-ray crystallographic analyses of symmetrical allosteric effectors of hemoglobin: compounds designed to link primary and secondary binding sites
The rational design and X-ray crystallographic analyses of two symmetrical allosteric effectors of hemoglobin (Hb) are reported. Compound design was directed by the previously solved co-crystal structure of one of the most potent allosteric effectors of Hb, 2-{4-[(3,5-dichlorophenylcarbamoyl)-methyl]phenoxy}-2-methylpropionic acid (RSR4), which revealed two distinct binding sites for this compound in the Hb central water cavity. The primary binding site has been observed for all compounds of this structural class, which stabilize deoxy Hb by engaging in inter-dimer contacts with three of the four protein subunits. Interactions at the secondary binding site of RSR4 occur primarily between the 1 and 2 subunits and serve to further constrain the deoxy state. Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that compounds with the ability to simultaneously span and link both of these sites would possess increased potency, but at a lower molar concentration than RSR4. Two symmetrical compounds were designed and synthesized based on this hypothesis. The symmetrical effector approach was taken to minimize the number of compound orientations needed to successfully bind at either of the distinct allosteric sites. X-ray crystallographic analyses of these two effectors in complex with Hb revealed that they successfully spanned the RSR4 primary and secondary binding sites. However, the designed compounds interacted with the secondary binding site in such a way that intra-dimer, as opposed to inter-dimer, interactions were generated. In agreement with these observations, in vitro evaluation of the symmetrical effectors in Hb solution indicated that neither compound possessed the potency of RSR4. A detailed analysis of symmetrical effector±Hb contacts and comparisons with the binding contacts of RSR4 are discussed.

1. Introduction
Hemoglobin (Hb) is an allosteric tetrameric protein that exists in equilibrium between a low-af®nity deoxy or tense state (T state) and a high-af®nity oxy or relaxed state (R state). It is composed of two  dimers, 11 and 22, which are geometrically related by a twofold axis of symmetry that intersects a central water cavity. The assembly of these dimers into a tetramer results in four intersubunit interfaces (1±2, 1±2, 1±2 and 2±1). The T-state structure contains a wider central water cavity than the R-state structure and is preferentially stabilized by the indigenous allosteric effector 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) (a smaller water cavity in the R state precludes 2,3-DPG binding). This additional T-state stabilization shifts the Hb oxygen-equilibrium curve (OEC) to the right, resulting in enhanced oxygen delivery to the cardiovascular periphery.

Hb have also been shown to bind exclusively within the central water cavity of the T state and to modify the allosteric properties of Hb in a physiologically similar fashion to 2,3-DPG (Abraham et al., 1983, 1984; Perutz & Poyart, 1983). However, unlike 2,3-DPG, which binds in a 1:1 ratio with Hb, X-ray analyses of synthetic allosteric effector±Hb co-crystals have indicated that two or more of these molecules may bind simultaneously and in a symmetrically related fashion within the T-state central water cavity (Lalezari et al., 1990; Randad et al., 1991; Wireko et al., 1991). We have reported the high-resolution crystal structure of a potent synthetic allosteric effector, 2-{4-[(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamoyl)-methyl]-phenoxy}-2-methylpropionic acid (RSR13) (Fig. 1), in complex with deoxy Hb (Safo et al., 2001). Analysis of this co-crystal structure clearly indicated that two RSR13 molecules were bound in a symmetrically related fashion within the Hb central water cavity and that each engaged in equivalent inter-dimer interactions with three of the four protein subunits (Safo et al., 2001). Recently, the X-ray co-crystal structure of an analog that is more potent (in vitro) than RSR13, 2-{4-[(3,5-dichlorophenylcarbamoyl)methyl]-phenoxy}-2-methylpropionic acid (RSR4) (Fig. 1), revealed that four of these allosteric effectors can simultaneously bind in the Hb central water cavity (Moure, 1998). A comparison of the RSR13±Hb and RSR4±Hb complexes revealed that two of the bound RSR4 molecules superimpose on the RSR13-binding sites (referred to as the primary binding sites), while the other two RSR4 molecules bind to symmetrically equivalent secondary allosteric sites at the dimer±dimer interface (Lalezari et al., 1990; Moure, 1998). The increased potency of RSR4 compared with that of RSR13 has been attributed to effector±Hb interactions at these secondary binding sites, which serve to further constrain the T state and subsequently enhance this molecule's ability to shift the OEC to the right. This study focused on generating new allosteric effectors of Hb that would simultaneously interact with both the primary and secondary binding sites of RSR4. By spanning the two identi®ed allosteric sites with a single molecule, it was hypothesized that the Hb-constraining inter-dimer interactions of two RSR4 molecules would be maintained by one compound, but at reduced molar concentration and with a decreased entropic binding penalty (i.e. the thermodynamic cost of binding one molecule to a protein is less than that of two molecules; Jencks, 1981). Using similar strategies, several research groups have shown that tethering small molecules, which bind to separate subsites on the same protein, can provide new ligands with enhanced activity. Shuker et al. (1996) have demonstrated the value of this technique in a study that generated nanomolar-range inhibitors of FK506 binding protein by tethering two millimolar-range inhibitors that were found to bind at proximal subsites. In another study, the same research group tethered two weak inhibitors of metalloproteinase stromelysin to generate a compound that inhibited in the nanomolar range (Hajduk et al., 1997). Similarly, Burgess et al. (1999) tethered two weak inhibitors of human lung tryptase to generate a ligand with superior activity, while Maly et al. (2000) have developed nanomolarrange subtype-selective inhibitors of tyrosine kinase c-Src by tethering two compounds that were found to bind to different subsites of this enzyme. Based on the RSR4±Hb co-crystal structure, two symmetrical compounds, 1,3-phenylene[bis(2-{4-[(aminocarbonyl)methyl]phenoxy}-2-methylpropionic acid)] (TB5-27) (Fig. 1) and 1,3-{bis[2,2H -(2-{4-[(aminocarbonyl)methyl]phenoxy}2-methylpropionic acid)phenoxy]}propane (TB5-39) (Fig. 1), which incorporated features of the basic RSR4 scaffold were designed and synthesized. The research in this paper focuses on the X-ray crystallographic analyses of these two effectors in complex with Hb. Importantly, the presented results demonstrate the usefulness of X-ray crystallography in the design of new therapeutic agents and set the stage for the future development of second-generation allosteric effectors of Hb.

respective effector with 7.44 Â 10À6 mM oxygenated Hb. The crystallization setup was performed in a nitrogen-®lled glove box (as described previously; Safo et al., 2001). For both complexes, crystals suitable for data collection grew after 5 d. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at room temperature using Cu K radiation on an R-AXIS IIC imaging-plate system which was mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator (operating at 50 kV and 180 mA). The space group was P21, with one molecule in the asymmetric Ê unit. Diffraction data were collected to 1.87 and 1.85 A for TB5-27 and TB5-39, respectively. The data were processed using the program BIOTEX from Molecular Structure Corporation (The Woodlands, Texas, USA) and scaled and averaged with the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Data-collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table 1.
2.2. Structure determination and refinement

The structure determination and re®nement of RSR4 in complex with Hb is described elsewhere (Moure, 1998). The co-crystals of TB5-27±Hb and TB5-39±Hb were both isomorphous with the native deoxy Hb structure (Fermi et al., 1984). Binding of both TB5-27 and TB5-39 to deoxy Hb was ascertained from difference Fourier electron-density maps computed from Fobs(complex) À Fobs(native) amplitude at Ê 2.0 A resolution, where Fobs(complex) are the observed structure factors of the effector±Hb complexes and Fobs(native) are the observed structure factors from the previously determined structure of native deoxy Hb (Fermi et al., 1984). The agreement factor for the structural amplitudes between native and complex data (Rd-n) is reported in Table Ê 1 at 2.0 A. Models of the symmetrical allosteric effectors were built in SYBYL (version 6.4, Tripos Inc., St Louis, MO, USA) and were subsequently energy minimized using the Tripos force ®eld. These models were ®t to corresponding electrondensity maps using TOM-FRODO (Cambillau & Horjales, 1987). The TB5-27±Hb complex was re®ned using X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992a); attempts to re®ne TB5-39 bound at its

allosteric site failed. The initial model used in re®nement against the TB5-27±Hb diffraction data consisted of the native deoxy Hb coordinates without waters or sulfates. Topology and parameter ®les for TB5-27 were created based on the conformation of the effector in the difference electron-density map. All diffraction data were used in the re®nement process and 5% of the re¯ections were set aside for the calculation of Rfree. The ®nal structure-factor ®le contained anomalous differences and was used to re®ne the structure. A bulksolvent correction was also introduced into the re®nement. Rigid-body, positional and simulated-annealing re®nements resulted in an R factor and Rfree of 26.6 and 24.3%, respecÈ tively, for the structure (Brunger, 1992b). The allosteric effector coordinates were ®t to the density maps and two sulfate ions and water molecules were also added to the model. The model was subjected to several alternate rounds of positional, simulated annealing and individual B-factor re®nements and further addition of water. Manual adjustment of the model was intermittently performed with TOMFRODO. Re®nement statistics are reported in Table 2.

Puri®ed stripped human adult Hb was prepared according to a previously described procedure (Randad et al., 1991). Oxygen-dissociation curves were recorded on an AMINCO HEM-OSCAN oxygen-dissociation analyzer (Travenol Laboratories). Compounds were dissolved in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4 to give 10 mM effector solutions. Immediately prior to running oxygen-dissociation curves, the Hb (5.4 mM in HEPES pH 7.4) and the test compounds were mixed in a 1:1 ratio (50 ml of Hb plus 50 ml of effector

solution) to give ®nal concentrations of 2.7 mM of Hb and 5 mM of effector, with a molar ratio of 2:1 test compound to hemoglobin. Controls contained 50 ml of Hb in 50 ml HEPES buffer. Test samples were deoxygenated using nitrogen that contained 5% carbon dioxide. To measure the P50, or the partial pressure of oxygen needed to saturate Hb, samples were saturated with 95% carbogen gas mixture (95% oxygen; 5% carbon dioxide). The oxygen pressure was gradually increased and the OEC was recorded from left to right. Hb saturation was recorded with a dual-wavelength spectrophotometer (577 and 586.2 nm). P50 was calculated by linear regression analysis from data points obtained between 40 and 60% oxygen saturation. Each effector was tested in duplicate with controls and the results accepted if the controls were within Æ2 mmHg.

3. Results
3.1. Design of symmetrical allosteric effectors

The RSR4±Hb co-crystal structure was used as a benchmark to design symmetrical allosteric effectors. Fig. 2 is a twodimensional schematic diagram of important RSR4±Hb residue contacts in the primary and secondary binding sites. The primary binding site is located between the 1±2 and 1±2 subunit interfaces. The secondary binding site is located between the 1±2 subunit interface. The rationale for designing symmetrical allosteric effectors was based on the premise that tethering two RSR4 molecules would generate an effector that could simultaneously interact with both the primary and secondary RSR4 binding sites and consequently constrain deoxy Hb as well as two separate RSR4 molecules, but at reduced concentration. Binding-site interactions, effector orientations and distances between RSR4 molecules bound to the primary and secondary sites were used to design two symmetrical compounds, one rigid and one ¯exible (see Fig. 1). Both symmetrical compounds are basically two linked RSR4 scaffolds. Importantly, the `symmetry' aspect of these molecules was incorporated to eliminate the need for a speci®c `head-totail' binding orientation upon effector entry into the Hb central water cavity. Thus, it was rationalized that symmetrical molecules would bind to both the primary and secondary allosteric sites regardless of the `portion' of the effector that entered the central water cavity ®rst. 1,3-Phenylene[bis(2-{4-[(aminocarbonyl)methyl]phenoxy}2-methylpropionic acid)] (TB5-27) is the more rigid of the two analogs (see Fig. 1). This effector possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects a central phenyl ring, and was designed based on the observation that the 3,5-dichloro-substituted phenyl rings of the RSR4 effectors at the primary and secondary sites are in close proximity to one another and engage in parallel % stacking. The more ¯exible analog, 1,3-bis[2,2H -(2-{4-[(aminocarbonyl)methyl]phenoxy}-2-methylpropionic acid)phenoxy]}propane (TB5-39) consists of two RSR4 scaffolds attached by a ®ve-atom linker; a plane of symmetry bisects the central methylene of the ®ve-atom tether. It was hypothesized that the ¯exibility of a ®ve-atom bridge would allow any conformational adjustments that might be required for a symmetrical effector to simultaneously span both the primary and secondary sites.

The maps are contoured at 2.66' (a) and 0.92' (b). In both (a) and (b) only one of two bound effectors in the central water cavity is shown; in each case symmetry-related binding is observed for the second bound effector. Both electron-density maps were generated with TOM-FRODO (Cambillau & Horjales, 1987).

Crystals of both effector±Hb complexes were isomorphous with the high-salt deoxy Hb structure described by Fermi et al. (1984). A difference Fourier electron-density map obtained with the phases of the deoxy Hb structure revealed two effectors bound to the central water cavity in a symmetryrelated fashion for both complexes.

binding sites. The initial unre®ned electron-density map for TB5-39 and the re®ned 2Fo ± Fc electron-density map for TB5-27 are shown in Fig. 3. The electron density for TB5-27 is more ordered than that of TB5-39; for both complexes, effector primary-site electron density is more ordered than secondary-site density. Structure re®nement with X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992a) was successful for TB5-27; however, owing to low effector occupancy, re®nement of TB5-39 was not possible. The TB5-27±Hb complex was re®ned to an R factor of 16.3 and an Rfree of Ê 18.9% for all data to 1.87 A resolution. The ®nal model for the TB5-27±Hb complex consisted of 574 Hb aminoacid residues, four heme groups and 257 water molecules. Two sulfates were also identi®ed in association with the -subunits as described previously for RSR13 in complex with Hb (Safo et al., 2001). Overall, the electron-density map of the TB5-27±Hb complex was very good, with only weak main-chain electron densities observed for N-terminal residues Val1 and His2. Similar to the initial unre®ned Fobs(complex) À Fobs(native) electrondensity map, the 2Fo À Fc electron density at the TB5-27 primary site was clearly visible (with an average occupancy of 75% for the two primary site positions), while that of the secondary site was, by comparison, slightly less ordered (with an average occupancy of 50% for the two secondary-site positions). The re®ned structure of the TB5-27± Hb complex was very similar to the native deoxy Hb structure as well as the RSR4±Hb co-crystal structure. A leastsquares ®t of all C in the TB5-27±Hb complex with those of the native deoxy Hb and the RSR4±Hb complex resulted in root-mean-square deviaÊ tions (r.m.s.d.s) of 0.14 and 0.10 A, respectively. Owing to weak electron densities, differences in the positions of residues 1Val1, 1His2 and 2Val1 were observed in all three structures. The ®nal models of both symmetrical effectors (in complex with deoxy Hb) contained two symmetrically related molecules bound in the Hb central water cavity. Furthermore, for all three effector±Hb complexes compared in this manuscript, RSR4, TB5-27 and TB5-39, interactions for each symmetrically related pair of bound effectors in each individual X-ray co-crystal Figure 4 structure are equivalent. Therefore, Two-dimensional schematics of contacts between (a) TB5-27 and Hb residues and (b) Tb5-39 and only one of each of the effectors in each Hb residues. Red and blue effector molecules distinguish symmetrically related binding pairs. Black of the symmetry-related pairs is arrows represent important binding interactions between effectors and Hb.

detailed in the text. In general, the primary-site interactions for both of the symmetrical effectors were comparable to those of RSR4; however, there were signi®cant differences at the secondary binding sites: instead of the symmetrical effectors engaging in inter-dimer interactions at this location, as observed in RSR4, these compounds oriented in such a way that their secondary site methylpropionic acid moieties engaged in intra-dimer interactions (compare RSR4 binding in Fig. 2 with TB5-27 and TB5-39 binding in Figs. 4a and 4b). Speci®c atomic level effector±protein interactions will be discussed in detail for the TB5-27±Hb and RSR4-Hb complexes and, in general terms for TB5-39, which was not re®ned.
3.3. Comparison of symmetrical compound and RSR4 effector±deoxy Hb contacts at the primary binding site

Figs. 2 and 4 display two-dimensional contacts observed in the RSR4±Hb, TB5-27±Hb and TB5-39±Hb complexes; Fig. 5 displays three-dimensional contacts for each effector±Hb complex. Tables 3 and 4 detail speci®c hydrogen-bonding

interactions between RSR4±Hb and TB5-27±Hb, respectively. Analysis of TB5-27 at the primary binding site indicates that the gem-dimethyl (atoms C5 and C6; see Fig. 1) of the methylpropionic acid ®t into a hydrophobic cavity surrounded by residues 2Pro95, 2Thr137, 2Tyr140, 2Arg141 and 2Trp37 (Fig. 5b). In addition, the carboxylate of the methylpropionic acid (atoms C3, O1 and O2) engages in several water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Table 3) (watermediated interactions will be detailed in a subsequent section). Based on the position of TB5-39 at the primary site, it appears that the gem-dimethyl portion (atoms C5 and C6) of this effector's methylpropionic acid moiety engages in similar but weaker hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 5c). Analysis of RSR4±Hb interactions at the primary site indicates that the gem-dimethyl portion (atoms C5 and C6) of this effector's methylpropionic acid engages in interactions that are comparable to those observed for TB5-27 (Fig. 5a). In addition, the carboxylate of the RSR4 methylpropionic acid (atoms C3, O1 and O2) is involved in water-mediated interactions that are markedly different from those observed in the TB5-27±Hb complex (Table 4). The phenoxy rings (ring A in each effector; see Fig. 1) of both symmetrical effectors and of RSR4 engage in hydrophobic contacts with residues 1Lys99, 1Tyr35 and 1Trp37 at the primary site (Figs. 2, 4 and 5). Furthermore, the carbonyl O atom of the three-atom bridge in both TB5-27 (atom O16) and RSR4 (atom O16) is hydrogen bonded to the side-chain amine of 1Lys99 (Figs. 2, 4a, 5a and 5b). Based on the unre®ned TB5-39±Hb complex it is not possible to accurately ascertain the interactions of this carbonyl O atom in the effector's three-atom bridge (Fig. 5c). The TB5-27 central benzene ring (ring B) and the 3,5-dichloro-substituted benzene ring of RSR4 (ring B) share corresponding interactions at the primary site. Both effectors bind in a narrow hydrophobic pocket surrounded by residues 1Val96, 1Lys99, 1Leu100, 1His103, 1Phe36 and 1Asn108 (Figs. 2, 4a, 5a and 5b). Furthermore, the % electrons of this aromatic ring in both TB5-27 and RSR4 engage in hydrogen bonds with the side-chain amide N atom of residue 1Asn108. A similar interaction has been observed between the % electrons of the 3,5-dimethyl-substituted benzene ring of RSR13 and the side-chain amide N atom of 1Asn108 (Safo et al., 2001). The corresponding aromatic ring (B) in TB5-39 adopts a different orientation compared with these moieties in TB5-27 and RSR4, but appears to maintain similar contacts (Figs. 4b and 5c). An important difference in binding between the symmetrical effectors and RSR4 results from the lack of 3,5-dichloro substitution on ring B. At the RSR4 primary binding site, one of the chloro substituents inserts into a hydrophobic pocket created by the G-helix residues 1Val96, 1Lys99, 1Leu100 and 1His103 (Fig. 5a). Owing to the absence of such substituents on corresponding aromatic rings in both TB5-27 and TB5-39, this hydrophobic insertion is not possible. In addition, the primary site 3,5-dichloro-substituted benzene of RSR4 also engages in %-stacking interactions with the 3,5-dichloro-substituted benzene ring of RSR4 bound at the secondary site (Figs. 2 and 5a).

3.4. Comparison of symmetrical compound and RSR4 effector±deoxy Hb contacts at the secondary binding site

There are signi®cant differences between RSR4 and symmetrical effector binding orientations and residue contacts at the secondary binding site. The secondary site methylpropionic acid of TB5-27 (atoms C38, O39 and O40) engages in an intradimer hydrogen bond with the side-chain guanidinium of 2Arg104 (Figs. 4a and 5b; Table 4). By comparison, the corresponding methylpropionic acid of RSR4 engages in an inter-dimer hydrogen bond with the sidechain guanidinium of residue 1Arg104 across the dimer±dimer interface (Figs. 2 and 5a; Table 3). Moreover, the methylpropionic acid moiety of RSR4 also hydrogen bonds with the side-chain hydroxyl group of 2Thr38 (Fig. 5a), while its three-atom-bridge N atom (N17) engages in a hydrogen bond with the sidechain carboxylate of 1Glu101 (Table 3). Owing to the length of TB5-39, this effector extends beyond the TB5-27 secondary binding site, and it appears that its methylpropionic acid moiety (atoms C49, O50 and O51) engages in a weak intra-dimer interaction with the side-chain guanidinium of 2Arg104 (Fig. 5c). This observation is corroborated by a comparatively weaker electron density for residue 2Arg104 at the secondary binding site in the TB5-39± Hb complex, indicating that the weak effector±residue interaction allows movement of the 2Arg104 side chain.

The Hb 1 subunit is light blue, the 2 subunit is magenta, the 1 subunit is orange and the 2 subunit is red. C atoms of allosteric effectors are yellow, O atoms are red and N atoms are blue. Dashed black lines indicate hydrogen bonds. For clarity, not all Hb residues lining the allosteric binding sites are shown. Note, for visualization purposes, and owing to secondary-site binding orientation differences between RSR4 and the symmetrical effectors, Hb residue labels and interaction distances for RSR4 in Fig. 5(a) are labeled on the opposite side of the dimer±dimer interface with respect to labeled residues and interaction distances in the TB5-27±Hb complex (Fig. 5b) and the TB5-39±Hb complex (Fig. 5c). For clarity of description, textual reference to RSR4±Hb residue contacts follow dimer±dimer interface residue labeling as pictured for TB5-27 and TB539. Importantly, the described RSR4 interactions in the text correspond to equivalent interactions made by this effector at its symmetry-related binding sites and are the mirror image of the contacts labeled in Fig. 5(a)..

Several structurally conserved water molecules mediate effector±Hb hydrogen bonds in both the TB5-27 and RSR4 complexes. At the primary binding site, the TB5-27 methylpropionic acid engages in two water-mediated hydrogen bonds: one with the side-chain guanidinium of 2Arg141 and one with the side-chain amine of 1Lys99 (Fig. 5b; Table 4). There is also a water-mediated hydrogen bond between the TB5-27 primary site phenoxy ether (atom O7) and the side-chain amine of 1Lys99 (Fig. 5b; Table 4). At the RSR4 primary binding site, the effector methylpropionic acid engages in water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the terminal carboxylate of 2Arg141, the backbone

carbonyl of 2Thr137 and the backbone carbonyl group of 1Lys127 (Fig. 5a; Table 3). Two structurally conserved water molecules are located in close proximity to the three-atom-bridge amide N atoms of both TB5-27 (N17) and RSR4 (N17) at their primary binding sites. These two water molecules are also structurally conserved in the native deoxy Hb structure (Fermi et al., 1984). In both TB5-27 and RSR4, one of these waters mediates a hydrogen bond with the side-chain phenol of residue 1Tyr35 (Figs. 5a and 5b; Tables 3 and 4). Furthermore, in the native deoxy Hb structure and the RSR4 and TB5-27 co-crystal structures these two waters are part of an extended structural water lattice that forms a network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Fermi et al., 1984). No water-mediated hydrogen bonds are observed at the secondary binding site in the TB5-27±Hb co-crystal structure (Fig. 5b). On the other hand, in the RSR4±Hb complex a structurally conserved water mediates hydrogen bonds between the side-chain hydroxyl group of 2Thr38 and the side-chain guanidinium of 1Arg104, both of which engage in direct hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate of the RSR4 secondary site methylpropionic acid (Fig. 5a). Thus, this structural water serves as the corner of a quadrilateral hydrogen-bonding network that serves to stabilize the binding mode of RSR4 at the secondary site.
3.6. Biological evaluation

The allosteric potencies of TB5-27, TB5-39 and RSR4 were evaluated as P50 measurements; P50 is the partial pressure of oxygen needed to half saturate Hb at 298 K and atmospheric pressure. Using a Hem-O-Scan, the P50 of native human adult hemoglobin is 19 mmHg (Æ 1 s.d.). Allosteric effectors that stabilize deoxy Hb and subsequently decrease this protein's oxygen af®nity increase the P50 relative to that of native Hb. The potency of each examined effector was measured as a ÁP50 value, which is the measured difference between Hb P50 in the presence and absence of the effector. ÁP50 values for TB5-27, TB5-39 and RSR4 were 41, 37 and 50 mmHg, respectively. Thus, all three effectors decreased the oxygen af®nity of Hb by stabilizing the deoxy state; however, neither of the symmetrical effectors were as potent as RSR4. Hill coef®cient (n50) values for each effector were also calculated. The Hill coef®cients for TB5-27, TB5-39 and RSR4 were 2.20, 2.32 and 2.01, respectively. By comparison, the average Hill coef®cient for control samples was 2.5. Thus, these compounds had little effect on the cooperative nature of Hb.

4. Discussion
The high-resolution crystal structure of a potent allosteric effector of Hb (RSR4) revealed distinct primary and secondary allosteric binding sites and was subsequently used to design two symmetrical Hb effectors (TB5-27 and TB5-39) that would simultaneously interact with both of these sites. It was hypothesized that the two new compounds would be more potent than RSR4, as they would maintain the same important

effector±Hb interactions, but at reduced molar concentration and with a decreased entropic binding penalty. In vitro biological evaluation of the symmetrical compounds indicated that both possessed very good potency with respect to the majority of allosteric effectors in this general structural class (Abraham et al., 1992; Lalezari et al., 1990; Randad et al., 1991); however, neither symmetrical effector was as effective as RSR4. To link the biological activity of these two compounds to atomic level interactions, X-ray crystallographic analyses of TB5-27±Hb and T5-39±Hb co-crystals were performed. Comparison of symmetrical effector±Hb interactions with RSR4±Hb interactions indicated that differences in several key effector±residue contacts, as well as differences in effector±Hb water-mediated hydrogen bonds, accounted for observed differences in biological activity. At the secondary allosteric site, structural analyses of both TB5-27 and TB5-39 in complex with deoxy Hb revealed a binding mode that differed from that of RSR4. When symmetry-related pairs of either TB5-27 or TB5-39 bind in the deoxy Hb central water cavity, the same binding space that is observed for two pairs of symmetry-related RSR4 molecules (i.e. one pair of RSR4 molecules bound to the primary sites and one pair of RSR4 molecules bound to the secondary sites) is covered. However, RSR4±Hb interactions at the secondary binding site are inter-dimer with respect to primary-site interactions, while symmetrical effector secondary binding site interactions are intra-dimer with respect to primary-site symmetrical effector±Hb interactions. Fig. 6 displays a stereo diagram of superimposed symmetry-related pairs of RSR4, RSR13, TB5-27 and TB5-39; note how primary binding site orientations are very similar for all effectors, while secondarysite orientations show that different binding modes have been adopted; the symmetrical effector's methylpropionic acid moieties turn towards the dimer on which the effector is primarily bound, while this functional group for RSR4 at the secondary site is extended across the dimer±dimer interface. Importantly, deoxy Hb is more constrained than oxy Hb owing to increased inter-dimer contacts across the dimer±dimer interface (Baldwin & Chothia, 1979; Bolton & Perutz, 1970; Kroeger & Kundrot, 1997; Shaanan, 1983); any effector that binds to the central water cavity of deoxy Hb and creates additional inter-dimer contacts will stabilize this allosteric state of the protein further (Abraham et al., 1995, Boyiri et al., 1995). RSR4 binds to the secondary site and contributes additional non-covalent binding interactions across the Hb dimer±dimer interface (Fig. 2); TB5-27 and TB5-39 bind at the secondary site, but do not add new non-covalent constraints to the Hb dimer±dimer interface (Fig. 4). Interestingly, % stacking between the two 3,5-dichlorosubtituted benzene rings of RSR4 effectors bound at the primary and secondary sites appears to direct the binding orientation and subsequent residue contacts made by the methylpropionic acid moiety of this effector at the secondary site (Figs. 2 and 5a). Based on the activity of structurally similar Hb effectors that have been observed to bind only at the primary site (Safo et al., 2001), and Hb solution bindingconstant studies performed with RSR4 and similar allosteric

between the effector methylpropionic carboxylate and the effectors (Abraham et al., 1995), it is clear that RSR4 initially side-chain guanidinium of 2Arg141 has been observed in binds at the primary site. This is then followed by effector analyzed effector±Hb co-crystals of this structural class. The binding at the secondary site, and it is likely that the primaryTB5-27±Hb complex displays this mode of binding, with a site effector serves to direct the orientation of secondary-site structural water molecule observed to mediate hydrogen binding by means of the intermolecular %-cloud stacking bonds between the effector methylpropionic acid carboxylate observed in the RSR4±Hb structure (Figs. 2 and 5a).

Thus, we predict that initial ylate of 1Asp126 is important for stabilizing the deoxy state. symmetrical compound binding takes place at the primary site The water-mediated hydrogen bond between the methyl and is followed by nesting of the rest of the molecule into the propionic acid of TB5-27 and the side-chain guanidinium of secondary site. However, in the symmetrical compounds there 2Arg141 weakens the 2Arg141±1Asp126 hydrogen bond, is no directionality imposed on the mode of secondary-site as it serves to buffer or `soften' the original salt bridge.

Subsequently, the 2Arg141±1Asp126 substituents on aromatic ring B (see Fig. 1) of RSR4.

This helix undergoes a rotation during the transition structure, a water molecule serves as part of a quadrilateral from the Hb deoxy to the oxy state (Baldwin & Chothia, 1979; hydrogen-bonding network that links the effector methylPerutz & Fermi, 1993). Hence, the RSR4 chloro group that is propionic acid carboxylate, the side-chain guanidinium of inserted into this helix serves to interrupt this rotation and 1Arg104 and the side-chain hydroxyl group of 2Thr138 subsequently stabilizes the deoxy state.

This observation, along with the intra-dimer versus inter-dimer binding mode of the symmetrical effectors at the secondary binding site, serves to partially explain, at an atomic level, why the two symmetrical compounds are not as active as either RSR13 or RSR4. Differences in structural waters that mediate RSR4±Hb and symmetrical effector±Hb interactions also appear to contribute to differences in the allosteric activity of the examined compounds. In particular, analysis of the RSR4±Hb complex indicates that a water at the primary binding site mediates a hydrogen bond between the effector's methylpropionic acid carboxylate and the terminal carboxylate of 2Arg141; to date, this Figure 6 water-mediated interaction has not been Stereoviews of symmetrically related pairs of allosteric effectors bound in the Hb central water observed in this structural class of effectors cavity.

5. Conclusions
In these studies, X-ray crystallography has been used to (i) identify two separate Hb allosteric binding sites for the allosteric effector RSR4, (ii) direct the generation of symmetrical compounds designed to simultaneously span both of these distinct binding sites and (iii) verify the binding modes of these compounds and characterize their atomic level interactions with Hb residues and structural water molecules. Thus, these studies have clearly shown the value of X-ray crystallography at every level of ligand development from concept to design to veri®cation. Based on the analyzed co-crystal structures, a signi®cantly more detailed understanding of the atomic level intermolecular interactions that lead to the allosteric modi®cation of Hb by this class of effectors has been attained. It is now clear that effectors in the general `RSR' structural class require a hydrophobic moiety that can insert into the Hb G helix (and thereby hinder the deoxy to oxy state transition) to achieve maximum potency, regardless of other new interactions that might be obtained at the expense of `sacri®cing' this interaction. Furthermore, these studies have provided new insights into the potential allosteric binding space that is available to this class of Hb effectors. In particular, this work indicates that it is possible to design allosteric effectors that will simultaneously bind to both the primary and secondary allosteric sites of Hb. Using the co-crystal structures of TB5-27 and TB5-39 as starting points, new allosteric effectors that will bind in an inter-dimer versus intra-dimer binding mode at the Hb secondary allosteric site will be designed. It is now evident that such compounds will require a `directional' measure in their structure to ensure that they point across the Hb dimer± dimer interface. This may be achieved by incorporating a structural constraint such as a double bond in the bridge that tethers two `RSR' scaffolds. Other strategies may involve varying tether lengths and composition, as well as adjusting the tether substitution patterns on the RSR scaffolds. Furthermore, future effectors designed to simultaneously bind at the primary and secondary sites will contain a hydrophobic substituent, such as a methyl or chloro moiety, that may insert into the Hb G helix. In fact, a combination of these modi®cations may be necessary to achieve enhanced effector potency.
