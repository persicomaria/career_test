CORRIGENDUM

Corrigendum to "Conformational Changes Induced by Binding of UDP­2F-galactose to -1,3 Galactosyltransferase--Implications for Catalysis" [J. Mol. Biol. 369 (2007) 1270­1281]

In this article we refer to an unusual distortion seen in the UDP­2F-galactose complex. We recently investigated this structure again and conclude that the carbohydrate moiety shown in Fig. 2 and the deposited atomic coordinates (RCSB Protein Data Bank code 2JCF) do not correctly represent galactose. The refined carbohydrate moiety has the incorrect configuration at both C2 (manno) and C3 (allo) positions and was idose rather than galactose. The structure incorrectly suggested that the pyranose ring conformation is distorted. We have re-refined the structure with the correct configuration (new RCSB Protein Data Bank code 2VFZ) and would like to replace Fig. 2a, Fig. 4 and Table 2 as shown here. We wish to point out that the bound UDP­ 2F-galactose remains in a "bent"or "tucked-under" configuration in the new structure and that the conformational changes in the enzyme on binding the donor substrate analogue, UDP­2F-galactose, discussed in the article, are unchanged. Thus, the conclusion regarding the role of ground-state destabilization in catalysis is not affected. However, our suggestion in the Discussion (end of page 1277) that the deformed sugar ring results from the substitution of fluorine at the 2 position is not correct because there is no distortion. Also, the statement on page 1276, directly above Table 2, that "Key residues responsible for stabilizing the 2F-gal in this conformation ..." should be changed to "Key residues that interact with the 2F-gal ...". Nevertheless, the residues discussed in the subsequent text are unchanged. In the corrected structure, there are some differences in contacts between the enzyme and inhibitor, particularly the F2 and O3 groups, which are given in the new version of Table 2.
