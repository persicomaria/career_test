Substrate-specific cytochromes P450 play major roles in steroid and eicosanoid biosynthesis and thus constitute important drug design targets.2 In contrast, P450 isozymes expressed in the liver take part in the metabolism of nearly all drugs.3 Adverse drug reactions, for instance to Prozac,4 result from individual variations in hepatic P450s.5 It is thus important to predict which P450s interact with a potential drug candidate and to understand the nature of these interactions. We have developed fluorescent probe molecules for P450cam (the prototypical P450) that consist of an R,-diaminoalkane chain connecting a dansyl fluorophore to the P450cam substrate adamantane:
Figure 1. (A) Absorption spectra showing the binding of camphor to P450cam (4.9 µM) in the presence of 1 equiv of D-4-Ad. The initial addition of D-4-Ad to P450cam results in a shift in the Soret absorption from 416 to 414 nm. A fit of the data to a competitive binding model gives a dissociation constant of 0.83 µM. (B) The camphor-induced shift from lowto high-spin P450cam (5.7 µM) in the presence of 1 equiv of D-8-Ad. Black, P450cam; purple, P450cam + 1 equiv of dansyl probe; blue to red, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 equiv of camphor.

A shift in Soret absorption (Figure 1) and greatly diminished dansyl luminescence attributable to Forster energy transfer to the heme6 ¨ (Figure 2) accompany probe binding. When D-4-Ad is displaced from the active site by camphor, fluorescence is restored (Figure 2a).7 Because a bright signal stands out against a dark background, substrate or inhibitor binding is readily detected. This assay, which is both simple and sensitive, can be employed to screen combinatorial chemical libraries.8 Both fluorescence and absorption spectra show that D-4-Ad binding to P450cam is competitive with camphor. The Soret shift (416-414 nm) induced by D-4-Ad indicates that it binds in the active site. With a Kd of 0.83 µM, D-4-Ad binds twice as strongly as the natural substrate.9 D-8-Ad also induces a shift in the Soret maximum from 416 to 414 nm: from the integrated D-8-Ad fluorescence in the presence and in the absence of P450cam, we estimate an upper limit Kd  0.02 µM for this probe.10 The crystal structure of the P450cam:D-8-Ad complex shows that the probe binds in the same channel as RuII(bpy)3-linker-Ad (bpy ) 2,2-bipyridine) analogues (Figure 3).11 The eight-carbon chain is nearly fully extended, allowing the dansyl moiety to bind at the surface of the protein. The good fit is attributable to conformational flexibility; that is, the F and G helices open just enough to allow the probe to enter and bind. The observed conformation is midway between the "closed" (camphor)12 and "open" (Ru-linker-Ad)11d structures.

Figure 2. Fluorescence spectra of D-4-Ad (A) and D-8-Ad (B). Black, 2 µM D-8-Ad or D-4-Ad; purple, 2 µM dansyl probe + 1 equiv of P450cam; blue to red, 2 µM P450cam and dansyl probe + 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 equiv of camphor (Kd ) 1.6 µM).9

The structure reveals a hydrogen bond between the amide carbonyl of the probe and Tyr96 in P450cam:D-8-Ad, mimicking the hydrogen bond between camphor and Tyr96 in the P450cam: substrate complex.12 In addition, there are a great many hydrophobic interactions between the probe molecule and the enzyme; analysis of these contacts shows that much of the solvent-accessible surface area is buried. The estimated Kd of 0.02 µM corresponds to a binding energy of 11 kcal/mol, or 11 cal/(mol Å2) (Figure 4). The Ru(bpy)32+ analogues (Ru-9-Ad and Ru-F8bp-Ad) do not bind as tightly to P450cam, but the free energy changes per buried

(7) The fluorescence of D-8-Ad (max ) 480 nm) is blue shifted from that of D-4-Ad (550 nm), indicating that the D-8-Ad environment is less polar [Li, Y.-H.; Chan, L.-M.; Tyer, L.; Moody, R. T.; Himel, C. M.; Hercules, D. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975, 97, 3118-3126]. One possible explanation is that the hydrophobic tail of D-8-Ad folds back in solution to partially cover the dansyl fluorophore, effectively lowering the local dielectric. Although the fluorescence maximum is not concentration dependent (data not shown), D-8-Ad aggregation cannot be ruled out. (8) Schobel, U.; Coille, I.; Brecht, A.; Steinwand, M.; Gauglitz, G. Anal. Chem. 2001, 73, 5172-5179. (9) Atkins, W. M.; Sligar, S. G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988, 263, 18842-18849. (10) As with D-4-Ad, titration of a 1:1 mixture of P450cam and D-8-Ad with camphor results in conversion to high-spin ferric P450cam (Figure 1b). However, the fluorescence spectra indicate that D-8-Ad is not displaced from the enzyme by even a large excess of camphor (250 µM; see also Figure 2b). These data are consistent with simultaneous binding of camphor and D-8-Ad. Simultaneous binding of camphor and ruthenium tris-bipyridyl probes has been previously observed [Dmochowski, I. J.

The crystal structures of both compounds bound to P450cam have been determined to high resolution (Ru-9-Ad 1.55 Å, Ru-F8bp-Ad 1.65 Å).10b,d (Bottom) Dissociation constants, binding energies, buried solvent accessible surface areas (SASA), and the binding energy per square angstrom of buried surface area for the P450cam:probe complexes.

surface area are comparable. Thus, even though P450cam has evolved for a single, relatively small substrate, it has the ability to bind much larger molecules more tightly. The key to this ability is the mobility of the B, F, and G helices.11d Both solution13 and crystallographic14 studies of other P450s suggest that this feature is common to the P450 superfamily. The two probes described herein illustrate the usefulness of our methodology. D-4-Ad can be employed to screen potential P450 inhibitors, as it is easily displaced by other molecules with comparable or lower dissociation constants. In contrast, D-8-Ad binds extremely tightly: the conformational flexibility of the P450 fold allows the enzyme to close around the probe, thereby making a great many productive hydrophobic contacts. The insight gained from the D-8-Ad:P450cam structure could potentially lead to a more rational design strategy for P450 inhibitors.
