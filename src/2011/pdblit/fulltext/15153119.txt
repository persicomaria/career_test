The binding of indirubin-5-sulphonate (E226), a potential anti-tumour agent and a potent inhibitor (IC50 ¼ 35 nM) of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) has been studied by kinetic and crystallographic methods. Kinetic analysis revealed that E226 is a moderate inhibitor of GPb (Ki ¼ 13.8 ± 0.2 lM) and GPa (Ki ¼ 57.8 ± 7.1 lM) and acts synergistically with glucose. To explore the molecular basis of E226 binding we have determined the crystal structure of the GPb/E226 complex at ° 2.3 A resolution. Structure analysis shows clearly that E226 binds at the purine inhibitor site, where caffeine and flavopiridol also bind [Oikonomakos, N.G., Schnier, J.B., Zographos, S.E., Skamnaki, V.T., Tsitsanou, K.E. & Johnson, L.N. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 34566­34573], by intercalating between the two aromatic rings of Phe285 and Tyr613. The mode of binding of E226 to GPb is similar, but not

identical, to that of caffeine and flavopiridol. Comparative structural analyses of the GPb­E226, GPb­caffeine and GPb­flavopiridol complex structures reveal the structural basis of the differences in the potencies of the three inhibitors and indicate binding residues in the inhibitor site that can be exploited to obtain more potent inhibitors. Structural comparison of the GPb­E226 complex structure with the active pCDK2­cyclin A­E226 complex structure clearly shows the different binding modes of the ligand to GPb and CDK2; the more extensive interactions of E226 with the active site of CDK2 may explain its higher affinity towards the latter enzyme. Keywords: indirubin-5-sulphonate; inhibitor; glycogen phosphorylase; type 2 diabetes; X-ray crystallography.

Inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1; GP) have been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for improving glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus and various studies have shown the efficacy of such compounds at lowering blood glucose or inhibiting liver glycogenolysis in vivo [1­3]. GP is an allosteric enzyme that exists in two interconvertible forms, GPb (low activity, predominantly T state) and GPa (high activity, predominantly R state) [4,5]. GPa plays a major role in the regulation of glycogen degradation [6­8] as well as in proliferating cells [9].

Previous studies have shown that flavopiridol, a compound with promising anti-tumour properties, that targets cyclindependent kinases (CDKs) 1,2,4,7 by binding to the ATP binding site [10], was also inhibiting the activity of GP [11]. Flavopiridol binds at the inhibitor site of GP [12], a highly ° hydrophobic binding pocket, located 12 A from the catalytic site. Compounds such as flavopiridol, which target both CDK2 and GP, could have a combined action in tumour cells by disrupting the cell cycle and sending cells to apoptosis while starving cancer cells of glucose. It has been reported that indirubins are potent inhibitors of CDKs [50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the 50­100 nM range], a family of key cell cycle regulators [13]. One of these, indirubin-5-sulphonate (E226) (Scheme 1) was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor (with respect to ATP) of monomeric CDK2 (IC50 ¼ 35 nM) [13] and pCDK2­cyclin A complex [14]. Indirubins have also been shown to be potent inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase3b (GSK-3b), an enzyme that has been implicated in Alzheimer¢ disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer [15]. Indirubin-3¢-monoxime is extremely potent (IC50 ¼ 22 nM) and E226 is less potent (IC50 ¼ 280 nM) against GSK-3b. Recently, the discovery of new classes of 6-substituted and 5,6-disubstituted indirubins as potent inhibitors of GSK-3 was reported [16,17]. The effect of indirubins on GSK-3 might contribute to a potential antidiabetic action of these

experiments were performed using synchrotron radiation in EMBL-Hamburg, SRS-Daresbury, and X-rays in Jena, by exploring various ligand and dimethyl sulfoxide concentrations. The data for the GPb­E226 complex, presented here, were collected at room temperature at the Center for Design and Structure in Biology, Institute of Molecular Biology, Jena (Germany), using a MAR 345 image plate mounted on a Nonius rotating anode X-ray source with CuKa radiation ° ° (k ¼ 1.5418 A) at a maximum resolution of 2.3 A. A single crystal was soaked in a solution containing 20 mM E226 in 10 mM Bes pH 6.7, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, and 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide for at least 7 h prior to data collection. Crystal orientation and integration of reflections, interframe scaling, partial reflection summation, data reduction and postrefinement were performed using the HKL program suite [21]. Amplitudes were then obtained from the intensities by the TRUNCATE program [22]. Refinement Crystallographic refinement of the GPb­E226 complex was carried out with CNS version 1.1 [23], using bulk solvent correction. All data were included with no sigma cut-off. The starting model was the refined structure of the GPb­caffeine­IMP complex (Protein Data Bank code 1GFZ [12]) with caffeine removed. Several side chains of the protein residues were adjusted and water molecules were added to the model and retained only if they met stereochemical requirements. Difference electron density maps indicated two possible orientations of E226, related by a rotation of  180° around the short axis of the molecule. Both binding modes were modelled and refined as alternative orientations (I and II) with reduced individual occupancy (0.6 and 0.4, respectively). Apart from sulphonate oxygens, all atoms of E226 were restrained to lie on a single plane. Alternating cycles of manual building with the program O [24], and torsion angle dynamics, conjugate gradient minimization, and restrained individual B-factor refinement using the maximum likelihood target function as implemented in CNS were performed until the Rfree value could not improve any further. A summary of the data processing statistics and refinement parameters is given in Table 1. The program PROCHECK [25] was used to assess the quality of the final structures. The Ramachandran plot [26] showed that all residues lie in the allowed regions. The structure was analysed with the graphics program O [24]. A model of the inhibitor molecule, E226, was generated using the program SYBYL (Tripos Associates Inc., St Louis, MO, USA) and it was fitted to the sigmaA weighted 2Fo­Fc electron density map [27]. Solvent-accessible areas have been calculated for the free and proteinbound inhibitor to provide an estimate of the molecular surface area involved in binding to the enzyme, by using the program NACCESS [28]. Structures were superimposed over well-defined residues using LSQKAB [26]. All figures were prepared with the program MOLSCRIPT [29] and rendered with RASTER3D [30]. ° Coordinates for the 2.3 A resolution GPb/E226 complex have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/) (code 1UZU).

compounds and thus enhance the effects mediated by inhibition of GP. In this work we investigated whether E226 inhibits GP activity. Kinetic studies have revealed that E226 inhibits both muscle GPb and GPa and mimics the inhibition of caffeine and flavopiridol. In order to provide a stereochemical explanation for E226 inhibition, we have deter° mined the structure of GPb­E226 at 2.3 A resolution. The results show that E226 binds at the inhibitor site. Comparison of the structure of the GPb­E226 complex with the structures of GPb­caffeine and GPb­flavopiridol complexes provides useful information for the design of new potent inhibitors of the enzyme. A comparison of the binding of E226 to both GP and pCDK2­cyclin A complex is also presented.

Experimental procedures

Glc1-P (dipotassium salt), AMP, glycogen (oyster) and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company. Glycogen was freed of AMP as described previously [20]. Crystallization and data collection Native T-state tetragonal (P43212) GPb crystals were grown as described previously [12]. Preliminary crystallographic

Results and discussion
Synergistic inhibition by E226 and glucose Kinetic experiments with GPb showed that E226 is an inhibitor of GPb with a Ki ¼ 13.8 lM measured in the direction of glycogen synthesis, and in the presence of saturated concentrations of glycogen (1% w/v), AMP (1 mM), and various concentrations of Glc1-P and E226 (Fig. 1A). Measurements of the kinetic parameters of GPb at various E226 and glucose concentrations and fixed concentrations of the substrates Glc1-P (10 mM), AMP (1 mM) and glycogen (1% w/v) indicated that E226 exhibits synergistic inhibition with glucose (with an interaction constant of a ¼ 0.98 ± 0.06 suggesting that both E226 and glucose are able to bind to the enzyme at the same time (Fig. 1B) [31,32]. E226 was also shown to inhibit GPa activity in a manner similar to that of the b form, when assayed in the presence of saturated concentration of glycogen (1% w/v) and varied concentrations of the substrate Glc1-P (3­20 mM) and inhibitor (30­80 lM) in

the absence of AMP. The apparent kinetic parameters determined in this case were Km ¼ 2.3 ± 0.2 mM, kcat ¼ 56.1 ± 0.5 IUÆmg)1, and Ki ¼ 57.8 ± 7.1 lM, as expected for the binding of a T-state inhibitor to GPa which is predominantly R-state. Experiments to explore the effects of E226 on glycogen metabolism under physiological conditions (inhibition of glycogenolysis in cell-free liver extracts and in intact hepatocytes) are in progress and the results will be presented elsewhere. E226 binding to the inhibitor site of GPb Although the inhibitor site has not yet been used to design inhibitors targeted for therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus due to its low specificity, its properties have been studied extensively in the liver [33] and in the muscle enzyme (reviewed in [3]). The inhibitor site is located on the surface of the enzyme, between domains 1 (residues 13­484) and ° 2 (residues 485­842) of the enzyme subunit, some 12 A from the catalytic site. In the T state, the site obstructs the entrance to the catalytic site tunnel (Fig. 2). In addition,

Fig. 2. A schematic diagram of the GPb dimeric molecule viewed down the molecular dyad. One subunit is coloured light green and the other cyan. The positions are shown for the catalytic and the inhibitor site. The catalytic site, marked by glucose (GLC) shown in red and in balland-stick representation, is buried at the centre of the subunit access° ible to the bulk solvent through a 15-A long channel. Glucose, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme that also promotes the less active T state through stabilization of the closed position of the 280 s loop (shown in yellow), binds at this site. The inhibitor site, marked by E226 ° (shown in mauve), is situated on the surface of the enzyme some 12 A from the catalytic site and, in the T state, obstructs the entrance to the catalytic site tunnel.

there is no access for the substrate (glycogen) to the catalytic site; access to this site is partly blocked by the 280 s loop (residues 282­287). Glucose, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme that promotes the T state through localization of the closed position of the 280 s loop, binds at this site. In the T state, Phe285, from the 280 s loop, is stacked close to Tyr613, from the start of the a19 helix (residues 613­631) and together these two hydrophobic aromatic residues form the inhibitor site. Purines, nucleosides, nucleotides and heterocyclic compounds such as flavin mono-nucleotide,

flavin-adenine dinucleotide, riboflavin and flavopiridol have been shown to bind at this site in both muscle and liver GPb and GPa [12,31,33­36]). The affinity of these ligands is mainly due to the p­p stacking interactions developed from intercalation of their aromatic rings between the side chains of Phe285 and Tyr613. This intercalation stabilizes the closed position of 280 s loop and promotes the inactive T state. This, in turn, accounts for synergistic inhibition observed when a purine site inhibitor and glucose are both present. On transition from T state to R state, the 280 s loop becomes disordered and displaced, thus opening a channel that allows a crucial arginine, Arg569, to enter the catalytic site in the place previously occupied by Asp283 and create the phosphate recognition site; that also provides access for glycogen substrate to reach the catalytic site [4]. Whether the inhibitor site has a physiological role has yet to be

established but it may be used by an unidentified inhibitor to enhance the effects of the control of liver GPa by glucose, possibly in response to insulin [37,38]. The refined sigmaA weighted Fo­Fc and 2Fo­Fc electron density maps clearly indicated strong binding of E226 at the inhibitor site, consistent with the kinetic results (Fig. 3A,B). The structural results suggest that the inhibitor site can accommodate two possible orientations of E226, I and II, related by a rotation of  180° around the short axis of the E226 molecule. Each model was fitted in the density map and both orientations were explored in refinement; the best fitting in the electron density map was achieved with orientation I (Fig. 3A). In both orientations, E226 makes similar interactions with the residues of the inhibitor site (Tables 2 and 3). Hence, only orientation I will be considered throughout the discussion. E226 binds at the inhibitor site with the two indole groups in the same plane and the carbonyl groups at trans position with respect to the double bond that connects the two indole moieties (Scheme 1). The most characteristic feature of the E226 binding to GPb is the p-p stacking interactions of the E226 aromatic rings with the aromatic side chains of residues Phe285 and Tyr613 which appear to promote E226 binding (Fig. 3C). There is a hydrogen bond between atom N1 of E226 and Od1 of Asn282. Additionally, E226 is involved in a water-mediated network of interactions with GPb residues Asp283, Glu287, Ile570, Ala610, and Met615 (Table 2). The sulphonate group projects into solvent and is not involved in any hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 3D). E226, on binding to the enzyme, makes a total of 62 Van der Waals' interactions (48 nonpolar/nonpolar and 14 nonpolar/polar) with GPb residues (Table 3). On forming the complex with the protein, E226 becomes buried. The solvent accessibilities of the free and bound ° ° E226 molecules are 495 A2 and 182 A2, indicating that a ° surface area of 313 A2 becomes inaccessible to water or that E226 becomes 63% buried in the enzyme complex. The greatest contribution comes from the nonpolar groups, ° which contribute 251 A2 (80%) of the surface that becomes ° inaccessible. On the protein surface, a total of 267 A2 solvent-accessible surface area becomes inaccessible on binding of E226. The total buried surface area (protein ° plus ligand) for the GPb/E226 complex is 580 A2. The binding of E226 to GPb does not promote any significant changes in the conformation of the polypeptide chain. The superposition of the structures of the native T state GPb and the GPb/E226 complex over well defined residues (12­252, 261­314, 324­837) gave an r.m.s. ° deviation of 0.158 A for Ca atoms, indicating that the GPb/E226 structure is similar to that of the native enzyme. There is a small shift in the side chain confor° mation of Phe285 (0.3­0.5 A) (Fig. 4A). This residue shifts to optimize van der Waals' interactions with the indole ring. In the native structure there are two water molecules, which are not observed in GPb/E226 structure. These water molecules are displaced by E226 when it binds at the inhibitor site. The interdomain hydrogenbonding pattern in the vicinity of the inhibitor site, which stabilizes the T state conformation, is retained on binding of E226. E226, on binding to the inhibitor site, inhibits the enzyme through localization of the 280 s loop in its closed, inactive conformation. This prevents the crucial

conformational changes that are critical for catalytic activity, e.g. movement of Arg569 into the catalytic site to create the phosphate recognition site, and also prevents the binding of glycogen substrate. Comparison with caffeine binding Caffeine, like E226, binds at the inhibitor site of GPb with Ki  0.1­0.2 mM and functions with glucose in a synergistic mode [12,31,32]. E226 and caffeine bind in similar places within the inhibitor site. Upon binding, the six-membered ring of caffeine molecule superimposes onto the fivemembered ring of E226 indole moiety, which does not have the sulphonate group and these two rings superimpose with an angle of  8°. The five-membered ring of caffeine does not superimpose with any of the E226 rings. Indeed, it is placed in the space between the two indole groups of E226 (Fig. 4B). Caffeine, on binding to the hydrophobic pocket of the inhibitor site, is involved in water-mediated interactions with Glu382 and Asp283 and forms 79 van der Waals' contacts (44 nonpolar/nonpolar, four polar/polar, and 39 polar/nonpolar) with GPb residues, while the total buried surface area (protein plus ligand) for the GPb/ ° caffeine complex is 467 A2 [12]. The r.m.s. deviation between the structures of the GPb/E226 complex and the ° GPb­caffeine­IMP complex is of 0.164 A for Ca atoms. There are only minor differences between the two complex structures. The minor conformational changes between the two complex structures, at the inhibitor site, concern small ° shifts (0.2­0.3 A) of the side chain atoms of residues Phe285 and Tyr613 (Fig. 4B). Thus, Phe285 and Tyr613 tilt their side chains from their positions in the GPb/caffeine complex by  8° to place the aromatic groups parallel to the E226 plane, adopting a conformation similar to that of the unliganded enzyme. Caffeine exhibits approximately 10-fold weaker affinity for GPb than E226. The higher potency of E226 could be attributed to a specific hydrogen bond of E226 to Asn282. In the GPb­caffeine complex there are no specific hydrogen bonds apart from those to water molecules. Although caffeine is entirely buried at the inhibitor site, both inhibitors participate in almost the same number of van der Waals' interactions with GPb. E226 is not entirely buried at the inhibitor site but the sulphonate moiety is exposed to the bulk solvent precluding its participation in any direct contacts with the protein. Comparison with flavopiridol binding Similarly to caffeine, flavopiridol binds at the inhibitor site of GPb with an IC50 of 1 lM [11] and exhibits synergistic inhibition with glucose [12]. It is intercalated between the two aromatic residues Phe285 and Tyr613 and its ring system forms several contacts with GPb, by exploiting a few polar/polar and numerous van der Waals' interactions; it makes a total of four hydrogen bonds to water molecules and 107 van der Waals' interactions (58 nonpolar/nonpolar, six polar/polar, and 43 polar/nonpolar) [12]. The more extensive interactions with the inhibitor site may be one of the reasons that flavopiridol maintains a high affinity. The total buried surface area (protein plus ligand) for the GPb­ ° flavopiridol complex is 618 A2.

conformations of Phe285 and Glu382 in the GPb­E226 complex structure are very close to those of the native enzyme. The superposition of the GPb­E226 structure onto the GPb­flavopiridol structure complex reveals several significant differences. There is an adjacent pocket lined by His571 and Glu572, Arg770 and Phe771, Leu380 and Glu382, Tyr613, and Asn284 of the 280 s loop that can accommodate the chlorophenyl ring of flavopiridol. This part of the ligand exploits 29 van der Waals' contacts dominated by the substantial contacts made to almost all atoms of Glu382 [12]. In contrast, E226 makes no interactions with this pocket. This might indicate that a bulky group present in E226 may confer selectivity and tight binding to GPb. Comparison to E226 binding to pCDK2­cyclin A complex The complex structures of the monomeric CDK2­E226 and the pCDK2­cyclin A­E226 have been previously deter° ° mined at 1.9 A and 2.5 A resolution, respectively [13,14]. E226 binds to pCDK2­cyclin A complex more tightly than it binds to GPb. The structure of the complex of E226 with the fully active pCDK2­cyclin A protein complex (PDB code 1E9H) was used for the structural comparison. The crystal structure of the active pCDK2­cyclin A in complex with E226 has shown that E226 binds at the ATP binding site (Fig. 5), which is located between the N- and C-terminal domains. The high potency of this compound derives from its complementarity to the pCDK2­cyclin A binding site, in both shape and chemical character. The inhibitor forms three hydrogen bonds with the protein main chain atoms at

The binding mode of E226 is different from that of flavopiridol (Fig. 4C). Upon binding, the E226 indole moiety, which does not have the sulphonate group, forms an angle of about 30° with the benzopyran-4 one of flavopiridol. The overall structures of both complexes are similar. The r.m.s. deviation between the structures of the GPb­E226 complex and the GPb­flavopiridol complex ° is 0.159 A for the Ca atoms. Minor differences between the two structures at the inhibitor site include small shifts of the side chains of Phe285 and Glu382.

the hinge region. The N1 and O2 atoms of E226 are hydrogen bonded with the main chain oxygen of Glu81 and the NH group of Leu83 resembling interactions observed in the complexes between monomeric CDK2 and the ligands ATP and staurosporine [39]. Atom N1 of E226 forms a third hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen of Leu83. The plane of indole rings packs against hydrophobic residues Val18, Ala31 and Leu134, which constitute the surface offered by the N- and C-terminal domains of CDK2 to the binding cleft. Atoms C6 and C7 of E226 form an edge-to-face aromatic contact with Phe80 and the C4¢­C9¢ ring extends out of the pocket to contact a tunnel of hydrophobic residues constituted by Phe82, Ile10 and the alkyl portion of Lys89 [14]. Other key interactions occur between the sulphonate group with Lys33 and the DFG segment of CDK2. More specifically, Lys33 bridges two of the sulphonate oxygen atoms, while another oxygen atom makes a hydrogen bond with the main-chain N of Asp145. In contrast, the presence of the sulphonate group does not confer significantly to the binding of E226 to GSK-3b (IC50 ¼ 280 nM [40]). Upon binding to CDK2, a surface of ° ° ° ° 453 A2 (250 A2 nonpolar) of ligand and 260 A2 (184 A2 nonpolar) of protein become inaccessible to solvent [14]. Thus, the total buried surface area (ligand + protein) is ° 713 A2. Affinities calculated by LUDI [14] for the interaction of E226 with monomeric or pCDK2/cyclin A differ by a factor of approximately 10 in the predicted Kd. Comparison between pCDK2­cyclin A­E226 and GPb­ E226 complex structures show that E226 forms different interactions with the two proteins. Because of its high complementarity to pCDK2­cyclin A, E226 exploits specific hydrogen bonds that mimic those of ATP and nonpolar interactions that are made mostly to aliphatic chains. Additionally, the sulphonate group is involved in hydrogen bonding interactions. In GPb­E226 there are no specific direct hydrogen bonds to the protein apart to that with Asn282, the sulphonate group makes no interactions with the protein, while the nonpolar interactions involve mainly p-p stacking interactions with the aromatic groups of Phe285 and Tyr613. This may explain why E226 is a more potent inhibitor of pCDK2­cyclin A complex than of GPb.

Conclusion
In this study, we have determined the binding mode of E226 to GPb and compared GPb­E226 complex structure with GPb­caffeine and GPb­flavopiridol structures. Our structures provide a clear picture of the binding modes of these ligands in the inhibitor site of GPb. Flavopiridol is a more potent inhibitor of GPb than E226 (E226 exhibits 14-fold lower affinity to the enzyme). Our crystallographic experiments rationalize this difference by showing how E226 and flavopiridol are positioned at the inhibitor site. The extended ring system of flavopiridol forms more hydrophobic interactions with the protein than E226, leading to better affinity for GPb. E226­flavopiridol comparison has identified a pocket occupied by the chlorophenyl ring of flavopiridol. The chlorophenyl ring pocket may represent a good template for the design of specific and tight synthetic inhibitors. The inhibitor site is identically conserved in all mammalian GPs [41], indicating that E226 is likely to inhibit also liver GP, the more important target enzyme in terms of treatment of type 2 diabetes, and brain GP, the species present in proliferating cells [9]. We have also compared the interactions between E226 with the active pCDK2­cyclin A complex and GPb. The structural comparison of GPb­E226 complex with CDK2­cyclin A­E226 complex structure shows that E226 makes different interactions with two nonhomologous enzymes and illustrates how two different enzymes use different parts of an inhibitor to provide specificity.
