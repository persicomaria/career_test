Vinculin is a ubiquitously expressed actin-binding protein frequently used as a marker for both cell­cell and cell­extracellular matrix (focal adhesion) adherens-type junctions, but its function has remained elusive. Vinculin is made up of a globular head linked to a tail domain by a short proline-rich sequence, and an intramolecular interaction between the head and tail masks the numerous ligand-binding sites in the protein. Determination of the crystal structure of vinculin has shed new light on the way that these ligand-binding sites are regulated. The picture that emerges is one in which vinculin stabilizes focal adhesions and thereby suppresses cell migration, an effect that is relieved by transient changes in the local concentrations of inositol phospholipids. However, the finding that vinculin modulates the signalling pathways involved in apoptosis suggests that additional roles for vinculin remain to be discovered. Introduction Vinculin is a 116 kDa actin-binding protein (1066 amino acids) that is localized on the cytoplasmic face of integrin-mediated cell­extracellular matrix junctions (focal adhesions) and cadherin-mediated cell­cell junctions. Determination of the primary sequence of vinculin, along with biochemical and electron microscope (EM) studies, show that vinculin is made up of a globular head linked to a tail domain by a proline-rich region, and interaction sites for numerous binding partners have been mapped onto all three regions of the protein (Table 1) [1]. Among the best characterized of these is talin, which is thought to couple the cytoplasmic domains of b-integrin subunits to the actin cytoskeleton and is required for integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly [2]. Interestingly, all of the well characterized ligand-binding sites in vinculin (including that for talin) are masked by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head and tail domains [3,4], and the molecule is thought to exist in an equilibrium between active and inactivate states. Here, the activated state is used to describe a conformation in which the vinculin head­tail interaction has been disengaged and all of the ligand-binding sites are exposed, although vinculin might exist in several different conformational states.

Despite the extensive literature on vinculin, its precise role in focal adhesions remains to be elucidated. Vinculin overexpression reduces cell migration, whereas vinculin downregulation enhances cell motility. Moreover vinculinnull cells are less adherent, less well spread, are more motile and have fewer and smaller focal adhesions than wild-type cells, and signalling through both focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin are elevated [5,6], a feature typical of motile cells. This might explain why vinculin behaves as a tumour suppressor in model systems [7]. The recently determined crystal structures of fulllength vinculin [8,9] now reveal how the intramolecular interaction between the head domains (domains D1­D4) and tail domains (Vt, also called domain D5) inhibits the ligand-binding sites in vinculin by steric and allosteric mechanisms. Structures of the vinculin D1 domain bound to talin and a-actinin peptides show that these ligands bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the D1 domain [10­12]. Moreover, new data on talin show that it contains multiple vinculin-binding sites (VBSs), which are themselves buried within the hydrophobic core of the helical bundles that make up the talin rod and therefore require activation [12­ 14]. The mechanism(s) underlying vinculin activation is controversial. As the head binds the tail with high affinity (Kd < 10À9 M) [8,15], vinculin might be activated by a combinatorial mechanism requiring at least two binding partners [8], but exposure of the high-affinity VBSs in talin or a-actinin might be sufficient [10,11,16] (see below). Insights gained from the structure of vinculin are complemented by recent cellular and biochemical studies. The finding that the Arp2/3 complex, which drives the assembly of the dendritic actin networks in lamellipodia, transiently interacts with the proline-rich region in vinculin during cell spreading offers a possible explanation for the spreading defects in vinculin-null cells [17]. Interestingly, vinexin-b, which also binds to the proline-rich region in vinculin [18] and has been implicated in cell spreading stimulated by epidermal growth factors (EGFs), is absent from the focal adhesions formed in vinculin-null cells [19]. A role for tyrosine phosphorylation of vinculin in the regulation of cell spreading has also been suggested [20]. Vinculin has also been implicated in modulating the signalling pathways involved in apoptosis [6], and vinculin-null mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells are resistant to apoptosis (Box 1). Here, we focus on recent data showing that (i) vinculin in focal adhesions does indeed exist in an activated state, (ii) vinculin recruitment

strengthens adhesions and (iii) vinculin suppresses focal adhesion turnover. Vinculin structure The crystal structure of full-length vinculin reveals a five-domain auto-inhibited conformation in which the tail (Vt) is grabbed in a pincer-like manner by domains D1­D3 [8,9] (Figure 1a). The affinity between isolated D1 and Vt
Box 1. Vinculin modulates paxillin­FAK signalling and apoptosis
Recent data suggest two new and unexpected roles for vinculin. Vinculin-null mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells [47] are resistant to caspase-3 activation triggered by serum withdrawal, treatment with camptothecin (a cytotoxic anti-tumour drug that inhibits DNAtopoisomerase I) or detachment from the extracellular matrix. The cells can be resensitized by expressing full-length vinculin, but not by vinculin with a Tyr822Phe mutation, although the significance of phosphorylation of tyrosine 822 has not been established [6]. The authors [6] noted that activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 was significantly increased in the vinculinnull cells, and this was correlated with suppression of the initiator caspase-9. Inhibition of ERK resensitized the vinculin-null cells to apoptosis. Interestingly, phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr397 and paxillin on Tyr118 was increased in vinculin-null cells, and a vinculin Vt polypeptide (residues 811­1066) suppressed both phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin and resensitized the vinculin-null cells to apoptotic stimuli [6]. The vinculin and FAK binding sites in paxillin partially overlap [68], and the authors [6] propose that Vt competes with FAK for paxillin and that in the absence of vinculin, signalling of FAK or paxillin through ERK is constitutive and sensitivity to apoptosis is reduced [6].

domains is relatively low ($10À6 M), but additional contacts between Vt and D4, together with the fact that the vinculin head is covalently linked to Vt by the proline-rich region, result in very tight head­tail binding (Kd < 10À9M) [8,15]. Studies with isolated domains have identified three distinct ligand-binding regions in vinculin. Domain D1 contains binding sites for talin [21] and a-actinin [22]; so far, no specific ligand-binding activities have been shown for D2 or D3. The prolinerich region, which lies between D4 and Vt, binds to VASP [23,24], vinexin [18], ponsin [25] and the Arp2/3 complex [26]. In the auto-inhibited conformation, this region is partly folded, and lies across the surface of the vinculin tail, obscuring binding sites within the proline-rich region as well as the binding sites for filamentous (F)-actin [27,28] and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) [8] on Vt (Figure 1b). Recent studies have begun to reveal the nature of vinculin regulation. Using crystal structures of vinculin D1 bound to peptide fragments of talin [10,29,30] and EM structures of Vt bound to F-actin [31], together with biochemical and biophysical approaches, a model of vinculin activation has been proposed [8,15,31]. Ligand binding is regulated both sterically and allosterically, and conformational changes in the head, tail and proline-rich domains are linked structurally and thermodynamically. The tight binding between Vt and the head are thought to be too strong for a single ligand to activate vinculin. This has led to the proposal of a combinatorial pathway to activation in which vinculin is only activated at sites of cell adhesion

Binding sites for selected ligands are indicated in black. The vinculin tail (Vt) is held in place by contacts with domain D1 and domain D4. (b) The solvent accessible surface of Vt (grey) in the context of the full-length molecule (magenta). Vt is surrounded on three sides by D1, D3 and D4. This organization inhibits the release of Vt from the vinculin head, sterically blocking its interaction with F-actin. Contacts between Vt and D1 inhibit the conformational changes in D1 that would allow talin and a-actinin to bind (allosteric inhibition). The `basic ladder' and `basic collar' are involved in binding PtdIns(4,5)P2. The `strap' sterically hinders the exposure of the basic collar, and restrains the motion of the proline-rich region, inhibiting binding of vinexin, ponsin and Arp2/3. The proline-rich region forms a loop connecting D4 and the strap. This loop is flexible and was therefore not resolved in the crystal structure.

(e) Hypothetical structure of full-length vinculin bound to F-actin, showing the steric clashes between D1 and the upper site (blue); there are no clashes on the lower site. This steric clash provides a structural basis for the low affinity of full-length vinculin for F-actin, whereas the accessibility of the lower site should allow full-length vinculin to bind, at least weakly, to F-actin ­ this could be sufficient to cause the conformational change required for high-affinity binding.

when two or more of its binding partners are brought into apposition. Although the combinatorial model of vinculin activation is attractive, others have suggested that it can be activated by a single ligand such as talin or a-actinin [10,11,16] (Box 2). Given such a tight head­tail interaction, the spontaneous off-rate of Vt from the head is likely to be very slow on the timescale of focal adhesion turnover, so a trigger must exist to open the molecule at least transiently to allow multiple ligands to bind and achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. One possibility is suggested by the work of Janssen et al. [31], who recently showed that the actin-binding site on Vt comprises two distinct sub-sites, both of which must be engaged for high-affinity binding (Figure 1c,d). One binding site is exposed in the full-length auto-inhibited conformation, while the second is sterically occluded by the N-terminal domain of vinculin (Figure 1e). The partial accessibility of the binding site explains the structural basis of affinity regulation for F-actin and also suggests how the binding of F-actin to the exposed site, although weak, can enhance the on-rate for the second sub-site, providing a kinetic pathway towards achieving combinatorial activation. Binding of F-actin to the vinculin tail (once freed from its contacts with the head) also promotes Vt dimerization and thereby actin cross-linking [32]. An atomic model for this

Box 2. An alternative concept of vinculin activation
Although the combinatorial model of vinculin activation [8] is attractive, it has also been suggested that vinculin can be activated by a single ligand, and the VBSs in talin and a-actinin (when activated) have been proposed to be sufficient to drive vinculin activation [10,11,16]. However, much of this original work was done with isolated VBS peptides and fragments of vinculin head (D1) and Vt, and the results can be explained by the fact that the D1­Vt interaction between the fragments is $1000-fold weaker than that in the full-length molecule [15], owing to additional contacts with D4 and the covalent linkage between the vinculin head and tail. Bois et al. [16] also suggest that full-length vinculin binds to talin VBS peptides with a high affinity. Using full-length vinculin immobilized on a Biacore chip, the Kd of talin peptides were calculated to be either 2 nM [22] or $70­80 nM [16]. Significantly, the binding affinity between a VBS peptide (derived from a-actinin) and the vinculin head was identical to that for binding to full-length vinculin [22], which would appear to refute the existence of an autoinhibited conformation. The concern here is that immobilization of vinculin on or close to a solid substrate might act as a mild denaturant and result in vinculin activation. Despite these reservations, the authors also demonstrated that both talin and a-actinin VBS peptides stimulated the actin-binding activity of vinculin in solution at molar ratios of >5:1 (VBS:vinculin) [16]. The results with the talin VBS3 peptide are consistent with an earlier publication [54]. Further work will be required to establish the exact mechanisms of vinculin activation.

interaction has been generated by fitting the crystal structure onto difference maps derived from electron tomography [31]. The mode of dimerization is unexpected but results in a compelling model. Binding to F-actin activates a cryptic dimerization potential by triggering conformational changes within Vt [33], which seem to involve dislocation of the C-terminal arm from the base of the Vt helical bundle [31]. This then allows dimerization to occur and enables actin cross-linking. Vinculin in focal adhesions is in an activated conformation Although biochemical and now structural studies clearly establish that vinculin can be present in activated and auto-inhibited states, there has been no direct evidence to show that these exist within the cell. Chen et al. [19] have recently begun to investigate both when and where vincu¨ lin is activated using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Positioning of the cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP and YFP) as a donor­acceptor pair at the N- and C-terminal ends of vinculin, which interact in the auto-inhibited conformation, did not generate a satisfactory FRET probe. The authors therefore evaluated a `tail probe' in which the YFP sequence was inserted within the vinculin molecule between the proline-rich region and Vt. Crucially, the introduction of CFP and YFP did not result in activation of the tagged vinculin molecule, and the Factin-binding sites remained in a low-affinity state. Only after addition of the bacterial IpaA protein, which binds to the vinculin D1 domain with high affinity [19], and relieves the vinculin head­tail interaction, was F-actin binding detected. Concomitantly, a decrease in FRET ratio (1.48 to 0.81) and efficiency (46% to 32%) of the probe was observed, establishing that the vinculin FRET `tail probe' reports on the conformational changes associated with actin binding [19]. When the probe was expressed in cells, the FRET signals observed provided the first direct evidence that vinculin in focal adhesions was in an activated actin-bound conformation while the cytoplasmic pool was in the auto-inhibited state [19]. The studies also showed that activated vinculin was localized in those peripheral adhesions which turn over rapidly during cell spreading. Intriguingly, in gliding or dissolving focal adhesions, activated vinculin was concentrated at the proximal edge of the adhesion, whereas, unexpectedly, only a fraction of vinculin was seen in the activated state in stable or protruding adhesions [19]. This raises new questions about (i) how vinculin that is not in the active actin-bound conformation is localized to focal adhesions and (ii) the mechanisms that activate and inactivate vinculin in focal adhesions. Vinculin turnover is much more rapid than focal adhesion turnover The exchange rate of vinculin in stable focal adhesions has been determined using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged vinculin expressed in various cell lines, and fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching (FRAP). The measurements generally reflected conditions in which the release (koff) was time limiting and generated half-life times (t1/2) around a minute [34,35] or 10 s [36,37]. This

surprisingly fast turnover of vinculin is in line with the kinetics observed for other cytoskeletal proteins in adhesion sites, such as paxillin, zyxin and a-actinin [36­39]. The combinatorial model suggests that vinculin that leaves the focal adhesion would revert to the auto-inhibited conformation and re-enter the soluble cytoplasmic pool of inactive vinculin, although the possibility that it might be targeted for destruction has not been explored. By contrast, focal adhesions turn over much more slowly, with life-times in the range of 10­20 minutes. Local modulation of the exchange kinetics for focal adhesion proteins might account for the gliding of adhesions observed in motile cells, with protein incorporation and growth on one side and dissolution at the opposite side. A role for vinculin in strengthening cell­extracellular matrix interactions? Cells respond to mechanical stress applied to ligand-bound integrins either from outside the cell (e.g. stretching, pulling force or shear stress) or from inside the cell (e.g. RhoA stimulation of actomyosin contractility) [40­43] by enlarging their focal adhesions, and this is associated with increased recruitment of vinculin (as well as talin and paxillin) to focal adhesions [44]. In fibroblasts, mechanical stretch induces an influx of Ca2+ at the leading edge of cells, and this regulates local traction forces [45]. Blocking the Ca2+ signal with Gd3+ (gadolinium) correlated with reduced vinculin and phosphotyrosine at focal adhesions as well as inhibition of cell migration [45]. By contrast, Rac signalling, which regulates membrane-protrusive activities and cell spreading through Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization [43], was not affected by Gd3+ treatment [45], indicating that actomyosin contractility rather than actin polymerization is required for vinculin recruitment. Evidence that vinculin recruitment has a role in strengthening adhesions has been presented by Gallant et al. [46]. They measured the fluid shear force required to detach single cells from fibronectin-coated micropatterned islands of varying dimensions over time. To assess the effect of focal adhesion assembly on adhesion strength, they used NIH 3T3 cells, which lack focal adhesions when cultured overnight in the absence of serum but rapidly reassemble focal adhesions upon activation of RhoA by addition of either serum or lysophosphatidic acid. Surprisingly, maturation of the initial adhesion sites into focal adhesions contributed only $20­30% of the adhesion strength [46]. Adhesion strengthening was accompanied by a 300% increase in vinculin and a 90% increase in recruitment of talin to adhesion structures, whereas integrin levels were unchanged. These effects were completely blocked by inhibition of actomyosin contractility (by blebbistatin) or Rho-kinase (by Y27632) [46]. Furthermore, in vinculin-null F9 cells [47] or in NIH 3T3 cells in which vinculin was downregulated by RNA interference, adhesion strength was reduced by 20­25% [46,48] and the serum-induced strengthening of adhesions was abolished [46]. The results suggest that much of the adhesion force is provided by integrin binding to fibronectin and integrin clustering. However, adhesion strength is increased by a further 20­30% by mechanisms that depend on actomyosin

contraction and the recruitment of vinculin to focal adhesions. How vinculin exerts these effects remain to be elucidated, but recent studies on the interaction between vinculin and talin offer new insights. The talin­vinculin interaction Talin is one of several proteins (including filamin, a-actinin, tensin and integrin-linked kinase) implicated in coupling integrins to the actin cytoskeleton [1,49,50]. The globular N-terminal talin FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin and moesin) domain binds to the membrane proximal Asn-Pro-x-Tyr (NPxY) motif in b-integrin cytoplasmic regions [51] and is linked to a flexible rod made up of a series of amphipathic helical bundles [12], the most C-terminal of which contains an actin-binding site [52,53]. Interestingly, the rod also contains multiple VBSs [30], each of which is defined by hydrophobic residues aligned down one face of a single amphipathic a-helix. Co-crystal and NMR structures [10,29] show that the talin helix inserts into the vinculin D1 helical bundle and replaces helix 1 of the D1 domain [10]. In full-length vinculin, helix 1 of D1 packs against the vinculin tail, and talin binding is inhibited (Figure 1a). Further evidence that a conformational change must occur in D1 in order for talin to bind comes from a vinculin mutant that stabilizes the D1 fold ­ this mutant does not affect tail binding but reduces talin binding over 100-fold [8]. Interestingly, although the individual talin VBS peptides bind vinculin D1 with relatively high affinity (Kd 15­40 nM) [11,54], talin purified from smooth muscle binds vinculin in solution with low affinity [13], suggesting

that the activity of the VBSs in talin is also regulated. This is explained by the structures of the talin helical bundles, which show that the hydrophobic residues involved in vinculin binding point towards the interior of the bundle [12,30]. Clearly, these bundles must unfold or otherwise reorganize to release the VBS helix to bind vinculin. This phenomenon has been observed directly using NMR and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) techniques [12,14], and is inhibited by mutations that stabilize the talin bundles [13]. The challenge now is to understand how these VBSs become available in vivo, although at least one VBS towards the N-terminal region of the talin rod appears to be constitutively active [13]. One attractive hypothesis is that force exerted by actomyosin contraction might alter the conformation of the helical bundles in the talin rod, leading to activation of the VBSs contained therein. The response might depend on the stability of individual bundles, and be proportional to the force exerted upon them. The greater the force, the larger the number of VBSs that would be activated, leading to a graded increase in vinculin recruitment and strengthening of adhesion (Figure 2a,b). A similar force-induced conformational change in the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin has been shown to expose cryptic self association sites and to drive fibronectin polymerization [55]. a-Actinin is also thought to couple integrins to F-actin, and an a-helical peptide derived from spectrin repeat 4 in the a-actinin rod also binds to the vinculin D1 domain in a talin-like fashion [56]. However, the helix is buried within an antiparallel coiled-coil dimer within full-length a-actinin [57], so that a major domain unfolding would

Figure 2. Vinculin dynamics in focal adhesions. Integrin heterodimers are shown bound to talin either through the N-terminal FERM domain or an additional integrinbinding site in the talin rod. Talin dimers are not shown for simplicity. Actin filaments are shown bound to both the talin FERM domain and the C-terminal actin-binding site of talin. (a) Cytosolic vinculin in the auto-inhibited conformation is shown in steady-state equilibrium (arrows) with activated vinculin in adhesion sites, where it is bound simultaneously to talin (or other partners of D1) and other ligands. For example, Vt might bind to acidic phospholipids (yellow) in the lipid bilayer (phosphoinositides, PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or phosphatidylserine) (1) or to F-actin (2). The proline-rich region and/or Vt might also recruit other binding partners (hexagon) such as VASP, vinexin-b or paxillin (Table 1) (3). (b) Mechanical load favours vinculin incorporation (solid arrow) over release (dotted arrow), resulting in strengthening of adhesion sites, perhaps by activating the VBSs in the talin rod and by bundling of actin filaments through vinculin Vt dimer formation [31]. (c) Phosphoinositides (or phosphatidylserine) generated or released locally (larger yellow shape) compete with F-actin binding to Vt (1). Ultimately this could favour release (solid arrow) over incorporation (dotted arrow) of vinculin from the focal adhesion (2) and destabilize the protein complex on the cytoplasmic face of focal adhesions, resulting in the dissolution of the adhesion. Although talin and vinculin frequently co-localize in cells, it is interesting that vinculin is apparently not recruited to the integrin­talin complex found at the immunological synapse [67].

have to occur (distinct from the local unfolding of individual bundles in talin) for this interaction to operate in vivo. Evidence that this occurs has yet to be presented. Moreover, recent EM diffraction studies have provided an alternative model in which the vinculin head binds to the globular ends of a-actinin without significant unfolding [58]. How recruitment of vinculin to focal adhesions might stabilize these structures remains to be established. Vinculin has many binding partners (Table 1) and could exert its effects through several distinct mechanisms. For example, vinculin might cross-link talin (or a-actinin) to F-actin (Figure 2a), but it has also been shown to modulate FAK and paxillin signalling both of which are important in the regulation of cell motility [6]. Release of vinculin from focal adhesions and stimulation of cell motility Mutations that reduce the Kd of the vinculin head­tail interaction from 1 nM to 100 nM are sufficient to enable constitutive talin binding. Importantly, FRAP experiments show that expression of such vinculin mutants in cells results in a significant reduction of turnover in both vinculin and talin (but not paxillin) [35] and enlarged focal adhesions. These results are consistent with data showing that vinculin negatively regulates focal adhesion dynamics [59] and suppresses cell motility [60]. The question then arises how this suppressive effect of vinculin is relieved to enable focal adhesion turnover and cell migration. Although relaxation of actomyosin contractility rapidly signals the release of zyxin and VASP from focal adhesions, it does not signal the release of vinculin [61], despite similar turnover rates of these proteins in steady-state adhesions. Acidic phospholipids, such as phosphoinositides (PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylserine, bind to the lipid-interaction site in Vt and compete with Factin binding to Vt in vitro [62]. This raises the possibility that transient increases in such lipids could enhance release of vinculin from adhesions. Indeed, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has been implicated in the PDGF-induced displacement of vinculin (but not talin) from focal adhesions in mouse fibroblasts [63]. In neuronal cells, increasing PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels by expressing PtdInsP 5-kinase a resulted in cell rounding, and vinculin was lost from focal adhesions faster than FAK and paxillin. Conversely, kinase-dead PtdInsP 5-kinase a induced neurite outgrowth and retraction mediated by lysophosphatidic acid or semaphorin 3A (a neuronal guidance cue) was blocked, reflecting inhibition of focal adhesion turnover [64]. In B16-F1 cells, a GFPvinculin mutant deficient in acidic phospholipid-binding (vinculin-LD) displayed release rates (koff) comparable to wild-type protein in steady-state adhesions. However, the lifetime of focal adhesions was increased, while spreading and migration of cells expressing vinculin-LD were strongly inhibited [34]. Furthermore, overexpression of PtdInsP 5-kinase a (but not the kinase-dead mutant) stimulated release of wild-type vinculin but not the LD variant, and induced dissolution of adhesions [34]. Similarly, a vinculin mutant lacking the C-terminal arm of Vt and with reduced phosphoinositide-binding activity also significantly inhibited focal adhesion turnover and cell spreading when expressed in vinculin-null fibroblasts [59].

These results suggest a model in which focal adhesion dynamics is regulated by vinculin, and that transient increases in local phosphoinositide levels, which inhibit the vinculin­F-actin interaction, promote focal adhesion turnover and cell motility (Figure 2c). Interestingly, the muscle-specific splice variant of vinculin called metavinculin (which contains a 68 amino acid insert in the Vt domain), is localized in dense plaques and costameres, cell­extracellular matrix junctions that are much longer lived than focal adhesions. It could be significant that the Vt/D5 domain of metavinculin interacts less strongly with acidic phospholipids than does the Vt/D5 domain of vinculin [65]. The association of metavinculin­vinculin heterodimers with F-actin might therefore be relatively resistant to phospholipid competition, resulting in more persistent adhesions. Conclusions The past two years have seen major progress in our understanding of the structure of vinculin, yet much remains to be established about the role of the protein in a cellular context. Vinculin-null cells show a variety of phenotypes that clearly indicate a role for vinculin in cell adhesion, cell spreading, focal adhesion stability and strengthening, cell migration and resistance to apoptosis. Which of the multiple binding partners of the protein contribute to each of these characteristics, and how ligand binding is regulated, is still far from clear. There are also major gaps in our knowledge about the role of vinculin in cell­cell junctions (Box 3). In mice, vinculin is required during embryonic development, and vinculin-null mice die at around embryonic day 10 from neural and cardiovascular defects [5]. Elucidation of the role of vinculin in different tissues will clearly require a conditional knockout approach.

Box 3. A function for vinculin in cell­cell junctions
Vinculin is localized in cell­cell junctions of epithelial sheets. Experiments with vinculin-null F9 cells show that vinculin is not required for the assembly of cadherin-mediated cell­cell junctions, although a defect in formation of tight junctions was reported [69]. Rather, vinculin is believed to strengthen the mechanical links between adhesion complexes (containing E-cadherin, b-catenin and a-catenin) and the actin cytoskeleton. However, recent studies on the protein dynamics in cell­cell junctions have called into question the view [70]. Thus the dynamics of actin and actin-binding proteins such as vinculin was not correlated with cadherin­catenin dynamics. The data suggest a somewhat loose association of peripheral actin filaments in cell­cell junctions, leaving the role of vinculin undefined. Interestingly, vinculin-null F9 cells lack the lipid phosphatase PTEN, although PTEN mRNA levels are comparable with wild-type cells [71]. Levels of PTEN protein could be restored either by expressing vinculin or inhibiting the proteasomal degradation pathway with lactacystin, suggesting that vinculin protects PTEN protein from destruction in some way. Subsequent experiments indicate that vinculin is part of a protein complex on the cytoplasmic face of E-cadherin, which includes b-catenin and its binding partners MAGI-2 and a-catenin, and that this complex is required to stabilize PTEN protein [71]. PTEN is among the most frequently mutated tumour suppressor genes, but there are tumours in which no mutations in the PTEN gene have been identified, even though PTEN protein is not present. The authors suggest that loss of expression of any of the components of the above complex could explain the absence of PTEN [71].

Interestingly, mice heterozygous for vinculin are pre-disposed to stress-induced cardiomyopathy [66]. Basal cardiac function and histology is normal, but the intercalated disks are abnormal and a-actinin-containing Z-lines in the muscles are misaligned. In conclusion, the new data reviewed here offers the prospect of elucidating the function of vinculin both at the cellular and organismal levels. However, this will require a greater knowledge about the role of the many binding partners of vinculin. A more detailed characterization of the binding sites for these ligands should be facilitated by the availability of the recently determined vinculin structure.
