Abstract The structure of the title compound, 1, was determined by X-ray crystallography. One tricarbonylchromium [syn-Cr(CO)3] moiety is bound to the concave side of the dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene ligand while the other metal is bound to the convex side yielding an anti-Cr(CO)3. There are four independent molecules in the crystal with the main difference between them being the orientation of the anti-Cr(CO)3. Analysis of intermolecular interactions in the solid state confirms that the variable tripodal rotations are the result of short C­H···O(carbonyl) hydrogen bonds. In 1, the organic framework has flattened slightly relative to uncoordinated dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Interesting reduction chemistry is observed for bistricarbonylchromium complexes of conjugated diarenes bridged by (HC CH)x groups (x = 0, 1, 2) [1 ­8]. A closely related complex is h6,h6-dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraenebis(tricarbonylchromium) (1) reported by Muller et al. [9]. Dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene (2) can ¨ be envisioned as a conjugated diarene with two ortho bridging HC CH groups. Further reason to study the reduction chemistry of this complex is to determine whether it exhibits enhanced stabilization of the arenetricarbonylchromium anion as is observed for naphthalenetricarbonylchromium [10 ­ 12]. In the reference describing the synthesis of 1, no conclusive evidence was provided as to whether the chromium atoms were coordinated to the same side of the organic or to opposite sides [9]. To determine unequivocally whether the two Cr(CO)3 groups were bound in a syn,anti or anti,anti conformation, the crys* Corresponding author. Fax: +1-662-325-1618.

tal structure of 1 was determined by X-ray crystallography. The effect of the coordination of the two Cr(CO)3 groups on the geometry of the organic backbone is facilitated because the structure of 2 has been reported [13].

In addition, it was of interest to determine the tripod orientation of the Cr(CO)3 groups in 1 as this structural feature is of interest in arenetricarbonylchromium chemistry [14]. For arenes fused to another ring, there are usually three limiting situations considered [14 ­17]. These are the eclipsed, exo staggered, and endo staggered isomers. A theoretical discussion of the conformational preferences in complexes of this type has been made [15].

2. Results and discussion Complex 1 was synthesized as described in the literature [9]. 1H-NMR and IR for the compound obtained agree with those reported. 2 was likewise synthesized as previously reported [18].

2.1. Crystal structure determination of 1
To obtain crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography, slow vapor diffusion of hexanes into a concentrated dichloromethane solution of 1 was utilized. Data for compound 1 were collected on a Siemens R3m/V automated diffractometer fitted with a molybdenum source and a graphite monochromator (Ka radiation; wave, length 0.71073 A). The structure was discovered with application of program SHELXS-86 [19] and refined with SHELXL-93 [20]. Hydrogen atom positions were calculated and their contribution was included although their positions were not refined. The final R value was 0.0435. Relevant crystallographic data and structure refinement information for 1 are summarized in Table 1.

2.2. Structure of 1
There are four independent molecules of 1 in the solid state (labeled A through D). Fig. 1 contains a drawing of the four molecules showing the relative orientation of them in the crystal, while Fig. 2 provides a side view of the four molecules. From Fig. 2 it is clear that 1 adopts the syn,anti configuration where the synCr(CO)3 group is on the concave face of the dibenzocyclooctatetraene ligand. This trans configuration of the two Cr(CO)3 moieties agrees with previous results for tricarbonylchromium complexes of bent diarene ligands [21 ­23]. Tables 2 and 3 give listings for selected bond lengths and bond angles for 1. While the gross geometry of the ligand has not changed significantly upon coordination of the two tricarbonylchromium moieties, some subtle differences do exist. As is common when a Cr(CO)3 group coordinates to an arene, there is an increase in the arene C­C bond lengths [14]. The greatest differences in the organic backbone between 1 and 2 can be found by analyzing the angles between planes of carbon atoms (Table 4). Apparently, the occupation of the interior of the dibenzocyclooctatetraene by the syn-

Cr(CO)3 has the effect of flattening the organic. This is most obvious when a comparison between the arene ring planes for 1 (average of 73.3°) and 2 (81.3°) is performed. Thus, the angle between the arene rings has decreased by an average of 8.0° upon coordination of the metal. Most of this is accounted for by the decrease of the angle at the C(5) and C(12) hinge by an average of 5.5°. The primary difference between the four molecules of 1 is that the anti-Cr(CO)3 group adopts different rotational orientations in the crystal structure. Molecule A is exo staggered in contrast to molecule D which is approximately endo staggered. Molecule B can be considered as eclipsed while molecule C is intermediate between endo staggered and eclipsed. Thus, the angles away from perfectly endo staggered (0° endo staggered; 30° eclipsed; 60° exo staggered) for the four isomers are: A, 53.8°; B, 29.2°; C, 21.0°; D, 9.5°. The closely related h6-benzocyclooctatetraenetricarbonylchromium has the anti-Cr(CO)3 conformation with the tripod about 20° from a perfectly endo staggered configuration, similar to what is observed for molecule C [24]. While it is unusual for there to be different Cr(CO)3 orientations in the solid state for arenetricarbonylchromium complexes, examples exist where equivalent tricarbonylchromium moieties on the same molecule adopt different orientations [25,26] and two examples exist where there are two independent

molecules in the crystal with different tripod conformations [27,28]. All of the syn-Cr(CO)3 groups in 1 are oriented in an exo staggered configuration due to steric restrictions associated with the concave side of the dibenzocyclooctatetraene fragment. To find an explanation for the existence of the four different tripod arrangements, intermolecular distances were investigated. It was found that 24 intermolecular O···H distances less than the sum of the van der Waals , radii (2.7 A [29]) are present in the structure of 1 when , the C­H bond distances are normalized to 1.08 A [30]. These interactions, with the associated geometric parameters, are listed in Table 5. Clearly, there is a large variation of interactions present with the shortest , O···H being 2.29 A and the distance increasing to the , cutoff value of 2.7 A. The presence of these interactions in the crystal structure of 1 requires the determination as to whether some or all of these interactions should be considered C­H···O hydrogen bonds. While the existence of C­H···O hydrogen bonds was suggested many years ago [31 ­34], acceptance that cohesive C­H···O interactions can be classified as hydrogen bonds has been relatively recent [35,36]. However, there is some disagreement concerning the criteria that should be applied when assigning a C­H···O (C­ H···X) interaction as a weak hydrogen bond or van der Waals interaction. It has been suggested that no arbitrary H···X distance cutoff for C­H···X hydrogen bonds is appropriate and that even interactions greater

than the sum of the van der Waals radii still constitute hydrogen bonds [37,38]. This concept has been challenged with the suggestion that only H···X contacts significantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii be considered hydrogen bonds [39]. Indeed, C­ H···O hydrogen bonds have been the subject of theoretical studies [40 ­42] and much information concerning their importance has been obtained by intense analysis of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [35 ­ 38,43 ­62]. For the present study, it is assumed that C ­ H···O hydrogen bonds have H···O distances less than the sum of the van der Waals radii and the angle at hydrogen is greater than 110°. Using this definition, all intermolecular interactions for 1 in Table 5 are determined to be C ­ H···O hydrogen bonds. A search of the 1993 CSD yielded 474 structures in which a terminal chromium carbonyl oxygen acted as a hydrogen bond acceptor for a hydrogen bound to carbon (C ­ H normalized to 1.08 , , A; O···H distances B 2.8 A) [63]. The following mean , values were reported: C···O distance 3.51 A; H···O , distance 2.64 A; C­H···O angle 140.1°; C ­ O···H angle 124.9°. A comparison of these with the values in Table

5 indicates that most distances found for 1 are less than the mean values reported and the angles are in the range expected. From the above survey, it can be deduced that the crystal structure of 1 contains a number of strong C­H···O hydrogen bonds represented by the short H···O distances in Table 5. Other crystallographic studies have found hydrogen bonding in (arene)tricarbonylchromium complexes [28,57,64 ­70], although there are few reports of C­H···O(carbonyl) interactions [65,70]. In addition, it has recently been reported that an intermolecular interaction between carbonyl oxygen atoms and the p electron density of the coordinated arene is observed in the crystal structure of some (arene)tricarbonylchromium complexes [71]. It should be mentioned that there is also spectroscopic evidence for the involvement of (arene)tricarbonylchromium complexes in hydrogen bonding [72 ­ 77]. In view of the structural results, the question arises as to whether the C­H···O hydrogen bonds involving the anti-Cr(CO)3 groups in 1 should be strong enough to overcome the barrier to rotation found in arenetricarbonylchromium compounds. It has been reported that the strongest hydrogen bonds of this type are approximately 5 kcal mol - 1 [63]. The barrier to rotation in benzenetricarbonylchromium has been assigned a value of circa 0.5 kcal mol - 1 experimentally [78] and 0.3 kcal mol - 1 based on theoretical calculations [17,79]. A better value to use would be the calculated one reported

for naphthalenetricarbonylchromium (2.5 kcal mol - 1) [15]. Clearly, if these values are correct, a strong C­ H···O hydrogen bond is strong enough to overcome the barrier to rotation in 1. This agrees with the suggestion that the conformational preference of arenetricarbonylchromium complexes in the solid state may be determined by factors other than internal electronic effects [80]. An analysis of the hydrogen bonding contacts for the anti-Cr(CO)3 groups provides evidence for the ability of strong C­H···O hydrogen bonds to control the orientation of the tripod. Notice that the oxygen atoms on anti-Cr(CO)3 groups for molecules A [O(21A)···H(8A) , , 2.45 A; O(20A)···H(9A) 2.51 A; O(21A)···H(4B) 2.51 , , , A], B [O(21B)···H(4A) 2.38 A; O(20B)···H(7C) 2.47 A], , and D [O(20D)···H(8D) 2.36 A; O(20D)···H(3D) 2.53 , , A; O(22D)···H(9C) 2.55 A] participate in significant hydrogen bond interactions, suggesting that their orientations are determined by these interactions. However, only one oxygen atom of the anti-Cr(CO)3 group of molecule C participates in an intermolecular interaction , and that one is long [O(20C)···H(10D) 2.65 A]. This agrees with the similarity in orientation between the anti-Cr(CO)3 group of molecule C and that found for h6-benzocyclooctatetraenetricarbonylchromium [24] because the weak C­ H···O interaction involved is not strong enough to overcome the internal electronic preference in this molecule. With the identification of the intermolecular interactions in 1 and the determination that they have affected the anti-Cr(CO)3 group orientations, it is of interest to determine whether they likewise have an affect on the dibenzocyclooctatetraene ligand. Two of the three strongest C­H···O hydrogen bonds are between carbonyl oxygen atoms and H(4C) and H(4A). The hydrogen bond donors for these interactions are C(4C) and C(4A).

involving C(4) in Table 2 suggests that the hydrogen bonding has affected the geometry of the organic fragment. Notice that the two carbon donors with the strongest C­H···O hydrogen bonds participate in bonds with lengths significantly different than the other car, bon atoms [i.e. C(3A) ­ C(4A) 1.382 A and C(3C) ­ , compared with C(3B) ­ C(4B) 1.333 A , C(4C) 1.424 A , ]. Likewise, from Table 3, it and C(3D) ­C(4D) 1.328 A is observed that one of the angles with C(4) as a terminal atom [C(2) ­ C(3) ­ C(4)] varies significantly between the four molecules with the angles in molecules A and C smaller than in the other molecules. Fig. 3 contains a crystal packing diagram showing the hydrogen bonding network in the structure. In the crystal, the molecules form stacks parallel to the crystallographic a axis (Fig. 3). These stacks are interconnected by C­H···O hydrogen bonds. The A, B, and D molecules are connected to the ones above and below by hydrogen bonds. It is well documented that the oxygen atom of a metal carbonyl can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor for a hydrogen bound to carbon [52 ­ 54,57,72,81 ­84]. Likewise, coordinated arenes can serve as C ­ H hydrogen bond donors [83 ­ 86]. Even with these precedents, the C­H···O hydrogen bonding in 1 is more extensive and comprises more strong interactions than is found in most organometallic compounds that form C ­H···O hydrogen bonds. A possible explanation for the strength of the hydrogen bonds in 1 involves the increased acidity that coordination of a Cr(CO)3 group

imparts upon arene hydrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms a and b to the coordinated arene [86]. In fact, it has been reported that the coordination of a second Cr(CO)3 group to stilbene greatly enhances the acidity of both the arene and olefinic hydrogen atoms [87]. It is known that the strength of a C­H···O hydrogen bond increases with the acidity of the hydrogen atoms [48,50,51]. In 1, the combined effect of two Cr(CO)3 groups accepting electron density from the dibenzocyclooctatetraene increases the acidity of all hydrogen atoms resulting in increased propensity for strong C­ H···O hydrogen bond formation. A comparison of the bond lengths, bond angles, and angles between planes (Tables 2­4) indicates significant differences between the different molecules of 1, some of which have already been mentioned. An analysis of the distances between the Cr atoms and the arene centroids yields a somewhat surprising result. For the four anti-Cr(CO)3 groups, the distances from the metal to the centroid of the coordinated arene are 1.708, , 1.709, 1.709, and 1.695 A for molecules A through D, respectively. However, for the syn-Cr(CO)3 groups, the , distances are 1.704, 1.731, 1.731, and 1.729 A. While all of these values are within the range expected for arenetricarbonylchromium complexes [14], the difference between the value for the syn-Cr(CO)3 of molecule A and the other molecules is perplexing. Clearly, there is a complex interplay between intermolecular and intramolecular forces which controls the geometries of the four molecules in 1.

3. Conclusions The tricarbonylchromium groups in 1 coordinate to opposite sides of the dibenzocyclooctatetraene fragment resulting in syn- and anti-Cr(CO)3 moieties. 1 contains four independent molecules in the crystal. A three-dimensional array of C ­ H···O hydrogen bonds exists in the crystal structure of 1. These intermolecular interactions control the orientation of the anti-Cr(CO)3 groups. The main difference between the organic backbone in 1 and the structure of 2 is that the presence of the syn-Cr(CO)3 has the effect of flattening the boat conformation slightly. The structural results reported here have two profound implications. First, this research clearly indicates that arenetricarbonylchromium complexes are another class of compounds that can serve as organometallic synthons in supramolecular chemistry [59,88 ­ 90]. In addition, the control of the carbonyl orientation by intermolecular interactions supports previous indications that this may be the situation for a number of arenetricarbonylchromium complexes [80].
