The space-group symmetry of two crystal forms of rhodopsin (PDB codes 1gzm and 2j4y; space group P31) can be re-interpreted as hexagonal (space group P64). Two molecules of the G protein-coupled receptor are present in the asymmetric unit in the trigonal models. However, the noncrystallographic twofold axes parallel to the c axis can be treated as crystallographic symmetry operations in the hexagonal space group. This halves the asymmetric unit and makes all of the protein molecules equivalent in these structures. Corrections for merohedral twinning were also applied in the refinement in the higher symmetry space group for one of the structures (2j4y).

Owing to their importance in many signal transduction pathways, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are target molecules for important therapeutic compounds. Rhodopsin, one of the visual pigments in the retina, was the first GPCR to have its crystal structure determined (Palczewski et al., 2000). Multiple trigonal and rhombohedral crystal forms have been reported for rhodopsin (Edwards et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004; Standfuss et al., 2007; Salom, Le Trong et al., 2006; Salom, Lodowski et al., 2006; Lodowski et al., 2007). The structures of ground-state bovine rhodopsin and of one of its recombinant mutants (N2C/D282C) have been solved in space group P31 (Edwards et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004; Standfuss et al., 2007) with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The two molecules (PDB entries 1gzm and 2j4y) have similar crystal structures, but they are ° significantly non-isomorphous (a = b = 103.8, c = 76.6 A for the ° for the mutant). A major ground state, a = b = 109.3, c = 77.7 A intermolecular interaction important for crystal packing involves two antiparallel -helices from different molecules. These helix­helix interactions differ in the two crystal structures by a `sliding' translocation along the helical axes. While investigating the nature of this non-isomorphism, it became apparent that the crystal structures could also be described in space group P64 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. In the original crystallographic analysis of the ground-state molecule, the choice of space-group symmetry, i.e. trigonal versus hexagonal, was made mostly on the basis of a reduced  = 60 peak in the native rotation function. Rmerge values were not significantly different for the two choices of Laue symmetry. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the trigonal unit cell are related by a noncrystallographic twofold rotation axis parallel to the 31 screw axis. After the structure was solved, the original authors revisited the spacegroup assignment. The possibility of the structure being in space group P62 was considered and rejected. No consideration of P64 is described in the original structure reports. Because the symmetry operations in P31 are a subset of those in P64, the crystal structures of both rhodopsins can be successfully refined in that space group. Refinement of the ground-state structure started with the coordinates and reflection data deposited with PDB code 1gzm. Rmerge for the reflections related by the hexagonal symmetry was 0.043. Averaging them reduced the number of unique reflections to 13 785. The Rmerge reported for this data set was originally 0.119 in PDB entry 1gzm. The low Rmerge for the hexagonal averaging presumably came

the z axis) also improved the mathematical model for the diffraction pattern. The refinement behavior and statistics for both molecules indicate that space group P64 provides an appropriate description of these crystal structures. The protein molecules in each crystal structure are in identical environments (as far as the X-ray experiment is concerned) and not in two different environments as implied by the models in space group P31. Coordinates and structure factors for these reinterpretations of the two structures have been deposited in the PDB and assigned identification codes 3c9l (ground state, P64, untwinned) and 3c9m (mutant, P64, twinned). Refinement in the higher symmetry space group does not alter the fundamentals of the molecular packing in the non-isomorphous crystal structures. The two crystal structures still differ in the packing interactions between helices 5 in neighboring molecules that are now related by crystallographic symmetry operations rather than by noncrystallographic operations in space group P31. The two modes of interaction between these helices are similar to those described by ´ Melcak et al. (2007) in their discussion of the structure of Nup58/45. Nup58/45 is associated with nuclear pores and sliding interactions involving hydrophobic surfaces of antiparallel helices were suggested as being associated with regulation of the diameter of such pores. As pointed out by Standfuss et al. (2007), the different interactions in these two crystal structures are associated with different-sized solvent-filled channels. There is no known physiological function of these cavities, but they do provide a specific example of a structural feature that could have biological implications. Another possible ramification of sliding interactions between molecules is that they could contribute to structural heterogeneity, complicating their crystallization. Alternate interactions between hydrophobic surfaces, whether formed by helices or -sheets, could lead to a mixture of molecular packings inconsistent with the formation of a well ordered crystalline lattice. Identifying and controlling such interactions might aid in the crystallization of membrane proteins. This work was supported by NIH grant GM079191. I thank Krzysztof Palczewski for helpful comments and discussions and the two referees of the original report for their identification of merohedral twinning for the mutant data set and crystal.
