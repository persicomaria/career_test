The human ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases comprises the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR ErbB1 HER1), ErbB2 (HER2 Neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). ErbBs play fundamental roles in cell growth and differentiation events in embryonic and adult tissues, and inappropriate ErbB activity has been implicated in several human cancers. We report here the 2.4 Å crystal structure of the extracellular region of human ErbB4 in the absence of ligand and show that it adopts a tethered conformation similar to inactive forms of ErbB1 and ErbB3. This structure completes the gallery of unliganded ErbB receptors and demonstrates that all human ligand-binding ErbBs adopt the autoinhibited conformation. We also show that the binding of neuregulin-1 to ErbB4 and ErbB3 and the binding of betacellulin to both ErbB4 and ErbB1 does not decrease at low pH, unlike the binding of epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor- to ErbB1. These results indicate an important role for ligand in determining pH-dependent binding and may explain different responses observed when the same ErbB receptor is stimulated by different ligands.
growth factor receptor HER ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase structure

ErbB4 is the only member of the ErbB family for which structural information is not available. Although more closely related to ErbB3 in amino acid sequence, ErbB4 resembles ErbB1 in its ability to form ligand-dependent homodimers in solution and on the cell surface (11­13). ErbB4 binds to and is activated by the neuregulin (NRG) family of growth factors but also shares several ligands with ErbB1, including betacellulin (BTC), epiregulin, and heparin-binding EGF (14) (Fig. 1A). To provide insight into ErbB4 signaling we have determined the 2.4-Å crystal structure of sErbB4 and characterized its likely ligand-binding site. Unliganded sErbB4 adopts a tethered conformation similar to those observed for inactive forms of sErbB1 and sErbB3. These ErbBs are thus likely to undergo similar conformational changes throughout their signaling cycles. We have also measured binding of sErbB1, sErbB3, and sErbB4 to specific and shared ligands as a function of pH and show that pH-dependent ligand binding is determined by both the receptor and the ligand.

ecent structural studies of extracellular regions of ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3 (sErbBs) in the presence and absence of ligands have provided a molecular view of these receptors and the array of conformations they adopt during a signaling cycle (1­9). ErbB extracellular regions consist of four domains arranged as a tandem repeat of a ``large'' domain cysteine-rich domain pair (2). The ``large'' domains I and III adopt a -helical structure, and the cysteine-rich domains II and IV comprise a catenated series of eight and seven disulfide bond-containing modules, respectively, that form an extended spine-like structure. sErbBs assort into two conformations that differ significantly in the orientation of the domain I II pair relative to the domain III IV pair. These conformations are exemplified by the structures of inactive and ligand-activated forms of sErbB1 (3­6). In inactive sErbB1 and sErbB3, a 20 Å -hairpin loop extends from domain II and contacts a pocket near the C terminus of domain IV (3, 6). This interdomain contact or ``tether'' constrains the domain arrangement and prevents close association of surfaces on domains I and III that form a complete ligand-binding site. Ligand binding requires juxtaposition of these surfaces on domains I and III via a large movement of the domain I II pair relative to the domain III IV pair, which also unmasks the domain II -hairpin loop (4, 5). In ligand-activated sErbB1, this exposed loop mediates a symmetric interreceptor dimer interaction critical for signaling and is thus frequently referred to as the ``dimerization'' loop. The ligand-less sErbB2 adopts a conformation very similar to the ligand-activated form of sErbB1 in which the dimerization loop is constitutively exposed (7, 8). This conformation of sErbB2 appears to explain its readiness to partner with each of the other ligand-bound ErbBs (10). Both ErbB2 and ErbB3, which lacks a high-activity kinase, do not form stable homodimeric complexes either in solution or on the cell surface and appear to signal solely via receptor heterodimers (11, 12).

Cloning and Transfection. A DNA sequence encoding residues Gln-1 to Thr-625 of the Jm-a isoform of mature human ErbB4 (sErbB4) was amplified from an ErbB4 cDNA kindly provided by Axel Ullrich. The resulting DNA fragment was subcloned into the plasmid pSGHV0 by using the XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites and sequenced (15). This vector directs expression of human growth hormone followed by an octahistidine tag, a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-recognition site, and sErbB4 at the C terminus. Digestion of this fusion protein with TEV protease releases sErbB4 with the additional residues Gly-SerSer-Arg at the N terminus. A Lec1 Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line secreting the human growth hormone-sErbB4 fusion protein at 2 mg liter of sErbB4 was created following established procedures (15, 16). Protein Purification. Conditioned medium (4 liters) was concentrated 20-fold and exchanged into loading buffer (500 mM NaCl 10 mM imidazole 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0) by tangential filtration using 30-kDa molecular mass cutoff filters. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10% (vol vol), and the solution was applied to a 10-ml HiTrap chelating column loaded with nickel sulfate. The bound protein was eluted with 200 mM

imidazole. After cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease, sErbB4 was purified by ion exchange on a 6-ml Resource Q column, deglycosylated with endoglycosidase H and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 26 60 column. Pooled sErbB4 fractions were dialyzed against 20 mM NaCl 2 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated to 10 mg ml. A typical yield of purified, deglycosylated sErbB4 was 6 mg from 4 liters of conditioned medium.

20°C by hanging-drop vapor diffusion. Protein solution (1 l) was mixed with 1 l of a 3:1 mixture of 6 mM yttrium chloride in water reservoir buffer [900 mM ammonium sulfate 2.4% (wt vol) polyethylene glycol 3350 100 mM Bis-Tris, pH 5.5]. Before data collection, crystals were transferred to a solution of reservoir buffer supplemented with 30% (vol vol) glycerol and 5 mM yttrium chloride and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data to 2.4-Å Bragg spacings were measured at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X4A and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Table 1) (17). The crystals belong to space group C2221 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with CNS and AMORE using individual domains of sErbB3 as search models (3, 18, 19). The final model was obtained after several rounds of manual model building using O and refinement in CNS or REFMAC5 in the latter stages (Table 1) (20, 21). The structure was refined to an Rcryst Rfree of 0.235 0.266 and rms deviations from ideality of 0.008 Å 1.736° for bonds angles. The final model consists of residues 1­155, 160­302, and 304­616 in molecule A, residues 1­614 in molecule B, 16 N-acetylglucosamine residues, 138 water molecules, three sulfate ions, and one yttrium ion. The yttrium ion is found at a crystal contact coordinated with octahedral geometry by the side chains of four aspartates and two glutamates. This geometry and the observed bond distances are consistent with reported yttrium coordination spheres in the Protein Data Bank (22). An additional arginine residue derived from the expression system is also present at the N terminus of molecule B. Analysis with PROCHECK shows that 82.3% of the residues occupy the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (23). Four residues, Tyr-132

and Ser-276 in both the A and B molecules, occupy a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot but occur in type II turns and possess Ramachandran angles characteristic of this type of turn (24). The two molecules superimpose with rms deviation of 1.74 Å for 608 C positions. Domains I, II, III, and IV superimpose with rms deviation values of 0.53, 0.82, 0.82, and 0.83 Å, respectively, indicating that much of the difference between the two molecules resides in the relative orientations of the domains. Unless specified otherwise, the following descriptions and analyses will use the B molecule because it is more complete.

superimposed by using the program O. Buried surface areas and lists of contact residues were calculated in CNS; surface complementarity coefficients were obtained by using the program SC (25). Figures were prepared by using POVSCRIPT (26) and rendered with POVRAY. Surface potentials were calculated by using GRASP, and figures were rendered with RASTER3D (27, 28).

Human EGF, TGF- , NRG1 , and bovine BTC were immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip (Biacore) as described (11). Briefly, after activation of the CM­ dextran matrix with 1-ethyl-3(3diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride and Nhydroxysuccinimide, samples of each growth factor at 200 g ml in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 (EGF, TGF- , and BTC) or pH 4.8 (NRG1 ) were flowed, in turn, over each activated surface at a flow rate of 5 l min for 10 min. One molar ethanolamineHCl was used to block remaining reactive sites. The fourth reference surface was activated and blocked with no ligand

bound. Equilibrium binding analysis of sErbB1 to EGF, TGF- , and BTC, of sErbB3 to NRG1 , and of sErbB4 to NRG1 and BTC was performed as described and confirmed that the sErbB proteins interact with these surfaces as expected (data not shown) (11). For pH titrations, sErbB proteins at a fixed concentration of 200 nM (for EGF, BTC and NRG1 ) and 400 nM (for TGF- ) were injected on to the biosensor chip at a flow rate of 5 l min for 10 min in 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, containing 100 mM of the relevant buffer. Buffers were used at different pH values: Tris, pH 7.0; Hepes, pH 8.0 and 7.5; Mes, pH 6.5; Bis-Tris, pH 6.0; and acetate, pH 5.5. Between injections, the surface was regenerated with a 10- l injection of 50% ethylene glycol in running buffer. For buffers at pH 6, this procedure did not remove all nonspecifically bound sErbB3 and sErbB4. Experiments were repeated on multiple surfaces to control for this accumulation of protein. The surface plasmon resonance response at the plateau of each injection was plotted as a function of pH. For these experiments, sErbB3 was produced as described (3), and sErbB1 was produced in insect cells (11).

sErbB4 Structure. Unliganded sErbB4 adopts a tethered confor-

mation similar to those described for inactive forms of sErbB1 and sErbB3 (Fig. 2) (3, 6). A comparison of the relative orientations of sErbB domains and subdomains is presented in supplementary material. Although two molecules of sErbB4 are present in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, they do not adopt the dimeric arrangement observed for inactive sErbB1 (6). In the tethered conformation, the arrangement of sErbB4 domains is constrained by a -hairpin loop that extends 20 Å from domain II and contacts a pocket at the C terminus of domain IV (Fig. 2). This contact buries 674 Å2 of surface area with a shape complementarity parameter of 0.70, values comparable to those reported for inactive sErbB1 and sErbB3 (3, 6). Details of the domain II IV contact among sErbB1, sErbB3, and sErbB4 are highly conserved and involve four main interactions (Fig. 2C). The central interactions are a triangular salt bridge hydrogen bond network among the side chains of Tyr243, Asp-560, and Lys-581 (sErbB4 numbering will be used unless otherwise specified) and a van der Waals contact between the side chain of Phe-248 and Gly-561. These interactions are flanked by a main-chain main-chain hydrogen bond between positions 243 and 573 and a hydrogen bond between the side chain at position 563 and either the main chain at position 248 or the side chain at position 249. The Tyr Asp Lys triad is absolutely conserved in all known vertebrate orthologs of ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4, and the other contact residues are conserved in type. Conservation of these residues indicates that the tethered conformation is likely to be a hallmark of all vertebrate ligand-binding ErbBs. The tether contact masks the dimerization loop and presents a barrier to the formation of a high-affinity binding site in ErbB1. Deletion of domain IV or mutation of sErbB1 domain IV residues that mediate tether contacts results in higher-affinity binding to EGF (6). Furthermore, the truncated form of sErbB1 inhibits EGF-stimulated mitogenesis 10-fold more efficiently than full-length sErbB1 (29). Thus, high-affinity ligand binding to sErbB1 appears coupled to opening of the tethered conformation, which also allows ligand-bound sErbB1 to homodimerize as observed in crystal structures of sErbB1 complexed with either EGF or TGF- (4, 5). Similarly, a truncated form of sErbB4 from which the 100 C-terminal amino acids have been deleted is a more potent inhibitor of NRG1 -induced ErbB4

activation than sErbB4 (30), suggesting that binding of NRG1 to ErbB4 corresponds to an opening of the tethered conformation. sErbB4, like sErbB1, is also able to form ligand-activated homodimers in solution (11). The homology among ligands and

receptors, the presence of shared ligands, and the similarities between the structure and behavior of unliganded sErbB1 and sErbB4 strongly suggest that ErbB4 follows the same activation cycle established for ErbB1 (2).
Ligand-Binding Surfaces. Given the apparently conserved binding

mode between ErbB1 and ErbB4, the structures of sErbB1 complexed with ligand provide a first approximation of ErbB4 and ligand residues likely to be near one another when ErbB4 binds ligand (4, 5). All ErbB1 and TGF- residue pairs with atoms 4 Å apart in the sErbB1 TGF- structure are listed in Table 3 (4). As noted by earlier authors, this table shows that interactions between TGF- and ErbB1 are extensive, 60% of TGF- residues contact the receptor, and the contacts made with domain I are predominantly main-chain mediated, whereas side chain-mediated interactions are more prevalent at the interface with domain III (4, 5). Despite very similar binding modes, 40% of both contact and overall residues are conserved between TGF- and EGF, indicating a high degree of versatility in ErbB-ligand interactions. The ErbB4, NRG1 , and BTC residue pairs homologous to the ErbB1 TGF- pairs are also shown in Table 3, and the positions of ligand-interacting residues on the surfaces of sErbB1 and sErbB4 are shown in Fig. 3A. Because TGF- binds to ErbB1 but not ErbB4, NRG1 binds to ErbB4 but not ErbB1, and BTC binds to both, elements of ErbB ligand specificity must be reflected in this tabulation. Unfortunately, only 10 of 35 ligandcontacting residues in ErbB1 are conserved in ErbB4 and only 8 of 31 of ErbB1 interacting residues with side chain-mediated ligand contacts are conserved in ErbB4. In many cases, similar residues are substituted between ErbB1 and ErbB4 ligand pairs, and the nature of specific interactions is likely to be preserved. In some cases, however, dramatic changes in the amino acid types involved in homologous ErbB1 BTC and ErbB4 BTC pairings appear to be tolerated without loss of binding, complicating interpretation of changes in homologous ErbB1 TGF- and ErbB4 NRG1 pairings. For example, ligand-contacting residues Tyr-45, Ser-99, Arg-125, and His-346 in ErbB1 are replaced by Ser-42, Leu-96, Tyr-123, and Ile-342 in ErbB4, respectively (Table 3). Examination of the shape and charge distribution of the sites on ErbB4 likely to interact with ligand also fails to reveal features that appear to correlate with or discriminate ligand specificities of individual ErbBs (Fig. 3B).
Ligand-Binding Affinities and pH Dependence. A cluster of histidine residues is present at the interface between domain III of sErbB1 and both EGF and TGF- (4, 5). It has been suggested that these histidines may play a role in release of ligand in the low-pH environment of the endosome following endocytosis (4), and it was subsequently shown that binding of EGF to sErbB1 was indeed substantially decreased at low pH (6). The two ErbB1 histidines at the domain III ligand interface, His-346 and His409, are not conserved in ErbB3 and ErbB4, suggesting that these receptors may not bind ligand in a pH-dependent fashion. pH-dependent ligand binding may be less critical for these receptors, which exhibit an impaired rate of endocytosis relative to ErbB1 (31). To investigate this hypothesis, the binding of sErbB1, sErbB3, and sErbB4 to their cognate ligands among EGF, TGF- , BTC, and NRG1 was analyzed as a function of pH. Surface plasmon resonance was used to measure binding, and the results obtained are consistent with earlier affinity measurements (11, 32). A representative surface plasmon resonance binding curve for sErbB4 binding to NRG1 at pH 8.0 is shown in Fig. 4A. At this pH, the affinity of sErbB4 for NRG1 is 146 nM, which is comparable to the value of 179 nM previously measured at pH 7.4 (11). This affinity is 2 orders of magnitude lower than has been reported for the binding of NRG1 to

erty of the receptor or may also depend on the ligand. As reported, binding of EGF and TGF- to sErbB1 decreases at low pH (6). Conversely, binding of BTC to either sErbB1 or sErbB4 and binding of NRG1 to either sErbB3 and sErbB4 do not decrease at low pH. These results demonstrate that ErbBs differ in the pH dependence of their ligand binding but that the receptor alone is not sufficient to confer pH-dependent ligand binding. The two histidines that are conserved in EGF and TGF- and contact domain III of ErbB1 in sErbB1 ligand complex structures, His-12 and His-18 in TGF- , are not conserved in BTC, which strongly implicates them as key mediators of pH-dependent ligand binding. Histidine is conserved at only one of these positions, His-18, in the ErbB1 ligands heparin-binding EGF, epiregulin, and amphiregulin, so it is not possible to predict whether this single histidine either by itself (amphiregulin) or combined with additional interfacial histidines (heparin-binding EGF and epiregulin) is sufficient to result in pH-dependent binding. Different responses to EGF and BTC have been observed in cells expressing only ErbB1 (35), and the pH dependence (EGF) or independence (BTC) of ligand binding provides a mechanism by which different responses may be achieved.
Concluding Remarks. The structure of sErbB4 completes the

gallery of unliganded ErbB extracellular domains and establishes that all human ligand-binding ErbBs adopt a tethered conformation in the absence of ligand. The presence of this tethered state, in which the dimerization arm is sequestered, strongly suggests that ErbB4 undergoes conformational changes comparable to ErbB1 when ligand binds. ErbB ligand-binding sites and ligands display a remarkable variability that challenges our ability to understand receptor­ligand specificity. The pHdependent binding observed between ErbB1 and EGF or TGFis not observed between ErbB1 and BTC and may underlie different ErbB1-mediated responses to these ligands. ErbB3 and ErbB4 do not exhibit pH-dependent binding, which may reflect their impaired rate of endocytosis relative to ErbB1.

The ErbB4 numbers are also comparable to those obtained for ErbB1: the affinity of sErbB1 for EGF is 175 nM as measured by surface plasmon resonance, but radiolabeled EGF binds to ErbB1-expressing cells with affinities between 0.3 and 3 nM (34). Interactions between sErbB1, sErbB3, and sErbB4 and their ligands were analyzed as a function of pH (Fig. 4B).
