Structures of the complexes of peanut lectin with methyl-b-galactose and N-acetyllactosamine and a comparative study of carbohydrate binding in Gal/GalNAc-speci®c legume lectins
The crystal structures of complexes of peanut lectin with methyl--galactose and N-acetyllactosamine have been deterÊ mined at 2.8 and 2.7 A, respectively. These, and the complexes involving lactose and the T-antigenic disaccharide reported previously, permit a detailed characterization of peanutlectin±carbohydrate association and the role of water molecules therein. The water molecules in the combining site are substantially conserved in the four complexes. The role of interacting sugar hydroxyl groups, when absent, are often mimicked by ordered water molecules not only at the primary combining site, but also at the site of the second sugar ring. The similarity of peanut-lectin±sugar interactions with those in other galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-speci®c lectins also extend to a substantial degree to water bridges. The comparative study provides a structural explanation for the exclusive speci®city of peanut lectin for galactose at the monosaccharide level, compared with that of the other lectins for galactose as well as N-acetylgalactosamine. The complexes also provide a qualitative structural rationale for differences in the strengths of binding of peanut lectin to different sugars.

1. Introduction
Protein±carbohydrate interactions form the basis of many biological recognitive processes. Lectins are multivalent proteins which speci®cally bind to different cell-surface carbohydrates and have therefore received considerable attention in recent years (Sharon & Lis, 1989a,b; Chrispeels & Raikhel, 1991; Rini, 1995). Crystallographic studies on lectins from widely different sources and their carbohydrate complexes have provided valuable information on the geometric features of protein±carbohydrate interactions (Weis & Drickamer, 1996; Drickamer, 1997; Elgavish & Shaanan, 1997; Loris et al., 1998). Lectins from the seeds of leguminous plants constitute the most thoroughly studied family. Crystal structures of the complexes of a number of legume lectins, including those from Canavalia ensiformis, Erythrina corallodendron, pea, Griffonia simplicifolia, Lathrus ochrus, lentil, Vicia faba, peanut, soybean and winged bean, with a variety of saccharides are now known (Hardman & Ainsworth, 1972; Becker et al., 1975; Reeke et al., 1975; Einspahr et al., 1986; Reeke & Becker, 1986; Bourne, Abergel et al., 1990; Bourne, Roussel et al., 1990; Bourne, Rouge et al., 1990; Bourne et al., 1992, 1994; Delbaere et al., 1993; Rini et al., 1993; Banerjee et al., 1996; Ravishankar et al., 1997; Naismith et al., 1994; Naismith & Field, 1996; Loris et al., 1993, 1996; Shaanan et al., 1991; Dessen et al., 1995; Prabu et al., 1998; Elgavish & Shaanan, 1998). All of them have essentially the same tertiary

fold, but exhibit a variety of quaternary structures and carbohydrate speci®cities. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin (PNA)1 is a nonglycosylated tetrameric lectin, Mr = 110 kDa, of identical subunits. It is speci®c to galactose at the monosaccharide level and binds preferentially to the tumour-associated Thomsen± Friedenreich antigen (T-antigen; Gal1±3GalNAc). The X-ray Ê analysis at 2.25 A resolution of the complex of the protein with lactose revealed that the tetrameric molecule has an unusual `open' quaternary structure, without the expected 222 or fourfold symmetry (Banerjee et al., 1994, 1996). The structure also provides a clear picture of PNA±lactose interactions. Indeed, it formed the basis of the structure-based redesign of the carbohydrate-binding region (Sharma et al., 1996, 1998). The structure of its complex with T-antigen at Ê 2.5 A resolution was subsequently determined (Ravishankar et al., 1997, 1999). PNA binds T-antigen 20 times more strongly than it does lactose (Swamy et al., 1991; Pereira et al., 1976). Yet the only additional interactions T-antigen has with PNA are two water bridges; this is an interesting instance where speci®city is generated apparently through water-mediated interactions. PNA also recognizes (with much lower af®nity) N-acetyllactosamine (Gal1-4GlcNAc), which contributes to the residual binding of the lectin at the cell surface, as the disaccharide occurs at the termini of saccharide chains of many glycoproteins (Langklide & érntoft, 1995). The structure of the complex of the lectin with this disaccharide is reported here. Also reported is the structure of the complex involving a monosaccharide (methyl--galactose). The four PNA±carbohydrate complexes, with a tetramer in the asymmetric unit in each case, including the two reported here, provide 16 crystallographically independent copies of the lectin's combining site. The structures thus provide a reliable means of delineating the salient features of the combining site and the water structure associated with it. The legume lectins of known structure can be broadly classi®ed into two groups in terms of speci®city at the primary site: mannose/glucose speci®c and galactose (or N-acetylgalactosamine) speci®c. Most of the early crystallographic studies have been concerned with the ®rst group. However, structures of a few galactose-speci®c lectins such as E. corallodendron (EcorL; Shaanan et al., 1991; Elgavish & Shaanan, 1998), lectin IV from G. simplicifolia (GS4; Delbaere et al., 1990, 1993), soybean agglutinin (SBA; Dessen et al., 1995; Olsen et al., 1997), basic winged-bean agglutinin (WBAI; Prabu et al., 1998) and peanut lectin (Banerjee et al., 1996; Ravishankar et al., 1997, 1998) and/or their carbohydrate complexes have become available in recent years. A detailed comparative study of the protein±carbohydrate interactions in these structures and those in the complexes reported here

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization

The protein was prepared by af®nity chromatography on cross-linked arabinogalactan (Majumdar & Surolia, 1978). The crystallization conditions for the complexes are similar and crystals were grown from a hanging drop of 5 mg mlÀ1 protein in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.2 M sodium chloride, 0.02% sodium azide, 1.5±10 mM of sugar and 12%(w/v) PEG 8000, equilibrated against 40%(w/v) PEG 8000 in the same buffer. All the crystals were isomorphous to the T-antigen (Ravishankar et al., 1997) and lactose (Banerjee et al., 1996) complexes (hereafter referred to as PTant and PLac, respectively). Data were collected at room temperature on a MAR Research imaging-plate system mounted on a Rigaku rotating-anode generator. Data for the N-acetyllactosamine and methyl--galactose complexes (hereafter referred to as PLacNAc and PMeGal, respectively) were processed using XDS (Kabsch, 1988) and DENZO/ SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993), respectively. The datacollection statistics are summarized in Table 1.

2.2. Structure re®nement

The same re®nement protocol was used for the two complexes. The structure of the PNA±lactose complex was used as the starting model, after removing water and sugar molecules. Re®nement was carried out using X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992). Standard Powell minimization was carried out throughout with non-crystallographic symmetry imposed. The NCS restraints were progressively relaxed in the ®nal cycle of re®nement. Both 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps calculated after a few cycles of re®nement showed clear density for the carbohydrates. The carbohydrates were ®tted into the map at this stage. All maps were inspected using FRODO (Jones, 1978). Only unrestrained group temperature factors were re®ned. Water molecules were added in steps from difference maps contoured at 2.5' and 2Fo À Fc maps contoured at 0.8'. Extensive use was made of omit-type maps (Bhat & Cohen, 1984; Vijayan, 1980) to inspect the model and water positions. The re®nement was monitored at every stage using the Rfree value. Engh and Huber parameters (Engh & Huber, 1991) were used throughout the re®nement. The re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Ê respectively. The average B values are 15.8 and 21.9 A2 for main-chain and side-chain atoms, respectively, in PMeGal. Ê The corresponding values for PLacNAc are 25.4 and 25.9 A2, respectively. The average values for the sugar and water in Ê PMeGal are 31.9 and 34.4 A2, respectively. The values in Ê PLacNAc are 34.6 and 141.3 A2 for the Glc and GlcNAc Ê moieties, respectively, and 43.8 A2 for the water. Hydrogen bonds were calculated using the program CONTACT in the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Acceptor-to-donor distances less Ê than 3.6 A were treated as hydrogen bonds if the angle at the H atom was greater than 120 in NÐHÁ Á ÁO contacts and the CÐOÁ Á ÁO angle was greater than 90 in the OÁ Á ÁO contacts. A Ê distance cutoff of 3.6 A was only used in the case where water O atoms are involved.

3. Results and discussion

The tertiary and quaternary structures of PNA in its complexes with methyl--galactose and N-acetyllactosamine are the same as those observed in its complexes with lactose 2.3. Accuracy, conformation angles, displacement (Banerjee et al., 1996) and T-antigen (Ravishankar et al., 1997). parameters and hydrogen bonds The striking feature of the tetrameric molecule remains its unusual quaternary structure which, contrary to expectations The ®nal models for both complexes had over 90% of the (Monod et al., 1965; Klotz et al., 1975), does not exhibit 222 or residues in the most-favoured region of the Ramachandran fourfold symmetry. The two dimers in the tetramer are related plot (Ramachandran et al., 1963). No residues were in the to each other by a non-crystallographic twofold symmetry, as disallowed region. The stereochemistry and geometry of the are the monomers in each dimer. However, these twofold axes models were checked using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., do not intersect, nor are they mutually perpendicular. Each 1993). The Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) calculated at the end of subunit has a jelly-roll fold characteristic of legume lectins the re®nement indicated average coordinate errors of 0.28 and Ê (Fig. 1). It consists of a six-stranded nearly ¯at -sheet, a 0.26 A in the atomic positions in PLacNAc and PMeGal, curved seven-stranded sheet, a small ®vestranded sheet which plays an important role in connecting the two larger sheets, and a number of loops of differing length and conformation which account for about 54% of the polypeptide chain. There are two hydrophobic cores in the structure. The ®rst one occurs between the six- and seven-stranded -sheets. The loops, which connect the -strands in the curved sheet and the curved sheet itself, enclose the second hydrophobic core (Banerjee et al., 1996). There are 236 residues in each subunit. In the crystal structures, only the ®rst 232 residues are seen clearly in the electron-density maps and the last four residues are presumably disordered. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the carbohydratebinding site, one per subunit, occurs at one edge of the subunit. The root-mean-square (r.m.s) deviations between the C positions when pairs of subunits are superposed range Ê between 0.28 and 0.29 A in the PLacNAc Figure 1 Ê complex, and between 0.06 and 0.07 A in A stereo representation of a subunit of peanut lectin with N-acetyllactosamine shown as a  PMeGal.

In addition to the interactions referred to above, found in all legume lectins with galactose speci®city, Asp80 OD2 is hydrogen bonded to galactose O6 in all four PNA±carbohydrate complexes. The same is true of the hydrogen bonds involving Ser211 OG. Of the four carbohydrate-binding loops (Young & Oomen, 1992), the fourth loop (211±216 in PNA) of variable length and composition is implicated in determining 3.2. PNA±carbohydrate interactions the speci®city of individual lectins for different sugars (Sharma & Surolia 1997). Ser211 belongs to this loop. The The saccharide-binding region is made up of residues in the water bridges involving W1 and W2 also occur in all four four loops 91±106, 125±135, 75±83 and 211±216. There is well complexes (in both PLacNAc and PMeGal, galactose O2 is de®ned electron density for the saccharides in both the crystal connected to Glu129 OE2 through W1 and to Gly104 N structures, as illustrated in Fig. 2, and this permits an unamthrough W2; galactose O1 is connected to Ser211 OG and biguous description of protein±carbohydrate interactions in Ê Gly213 N through W8 in PMeGal). The residues within 4 A of the respective complexes (Fig. 3; Table 2). A constellation of the sugar (Asp80, Ala82, Asp83, Gly103, Gly014, Tyr125, four invariant hydrogen bonds occur in carbohydrate binding Asn127, Ser211, Leu212 and Gly214 in PLacNAc; Asp80, in all galactose-speci®c lectins. They are, in the PNA Ala82, Asp83, Gly103, Gly104, Tyr125, Asn127, Ser211 and numbering scheme, Asp83 OD1±galactose O3, Asp83 OD2± Gly214 in PMeGal) make about 40 van der Waals contacts galactose O4, Gly104 N±galactose O3 and Asn127 ND2± with the galactose moiety in each of them. In fact, the position galactose O3. In addition, there are other invariant interacof this moiety is remarkably similar in all four complexes. tions, which include a stacking interaction with an aromatic Atomic deviations in the galactose moiety, when the 16 side chain (Tyr125 in the case of PNA) and the proximity of an Ê subunits are superposed, vary beween 0.1 and 0.2 A. The four Ala residue seen in all the legume lectin±carbohydrate loops which constitute the carbohydrate-binding region also complexes. remain invariant in the four complexes. A second sugar ring exists in three of the four complexes. The protein±sugar interactions are the same in PLac and PLacNAc, as the acetamido group points to the solution. Lactose and LacNAc have the same orientation and conformation in the complexes (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Ser211 OG and Gly213 N, both from the variable fourth loop, interact with Glc O3. The Ê number of residues within 4 A of the sugar increases by one when the second sugar ring is added. The number of atoms in these residues making a contact within this distance limit increases from approximately 40 to 60. PNA binds T-antigen 20 times more strongly than it binds lactose. Yet the interactions between the galactose moiety and the lectin are similar in PLac (and PLacNAc) and PTant (Banerjee et al., 1996; Ravishankar et al., 1997, 1999). The same is true of the nonpolar contacts. The linkage and the conformation of the disaccharides are such that O4 of the second ring of Tantigen occupies the same position as O3 as in the second ring of the other two disaccharides (Fig. 4). O4 in T-antigen is therefore hydrogen bonded to Ser211 OG and Gly213 N instead of O3 as in the other two disaccharides. The major additional interactions T-antigen makes with PNA are two water bridges involving the carbonyl O atom of the acetamido group. One water molecule (W3) connects the O atom to Figure 2 Ile101 O, while the other (W4) connects it to Omit map, shown in stereo, (a) contoured at 2.5' for methyl--galactose and (b) Asn41 ND2 and to Leu212 N.

Therefore, a detailed study of the water molecules in the combining site appeared worthwhile. The remaining 15 subunits, along with the hydration shells, were superposed onto subunit A of the T-antigen complex. All Ê water molecules within 5 A from any carbohydrate atom was considered to belong to the combining site. A superposition of such water molecules in the 16 subunits is given in Fig. 5. Most water molecules appeared in clusters, indicating the relative 3.3. Water structure at the combining site invariance of water positions in the combining site.

These clusters, years (Quiocho, 1989; Quiocho et al., 1989; Toone, 1994; named W1±W9, are listed in Table 3. Elgavish & Shaanan, 1998; Loris et al., 1998). The generation Water clusters W1±W6 are not displaced by sugar molecules of T-antigen speci®city apparently through water bridges in any of the four complexes and, with four subunits in each (Ravishankar et al., 1997, 1999) is a dramatic illustration of this complex, a maximum of 16 water molecules could occur in role. The fact that the two water molecules exist in the each cluster. The full potential is realised in W2 and W4, while combining site even when the lectin is not bound to T-antigen the number is 15, 14 and 11 in W1, W3 and W5, respectively. suggests that at least some of the water molecules could be The occupancy is rather low in W6, but the corresponding legitimately considered as an extension of the combining site. water molecule occurs in at least two subunits in each complex. The acetamido group in the second sugar ring displaces W7 in the Tantigen complex. It occurs in at least two subunits in the remaining three complexes. W8 and W9 are displaced by the second ring and therefore occur only in PMeGal. W8 occurs in all four subunits and W9 in two. W1 and W2 are involved in bridging Gal O2 to Glu129 OE1 and Gly104 N in all the complexes. W5 is hydrogen bonded to W2 on the one hand and Glu129 OE1 and Tyr130 OH on the other. Thus W1, W2 and W5 form a network which bridges galactose and peanut lectin at the primary binding site. W3 and W4 are also hydrogen bonded to the protein: W3 to Ile101 O and W4 to Asn41 ND2 and Leu212 N. In T-antigen, both hydrogen bond to GalNAc O7. The water bridges thus generated lead to the speci®city of PNA for T-antigen at the disaccharide level, as mentioned earlier. W6 is hydrogen bonded to W4, but not to any protein or sugar atom. In the three complexes other than PTant, where it does not exist, W7 bridges W3 and W4.

Thus, the high speci®city of PNA for T-antigen in comparison with that for other disaccharides appears to be generated by two water bridges.

Gly213 N and Gal O1, forming a water bridge between the protein and the glycosidic O atom, while the latter is hydrogen bonded to W6 only. Interestingly, after superposition the average position of W7 Ê is at a distance of 1.1 A from GalNAc O7 of T-antigen in its complexes. Thus, when T-antigen is not present in the combining site, the position corresponding to GalNAc O7 is occupied by a water molecule. As mentioned previously, O3 in the second sugar ring in PLac and PLacNAc occupy nearly the same position as O4 in the second ring in PTant. The distance between the average positions of O3 and O4 after superÊ position is as low as 0.9 A. The average distance of W8 from the average positions of O3 and O4 in the second ring are 0.5 Ê and 0.8 A, respectively. Thus, in the absence of the second ring, a water molecule occupies the position of the hydroxyl group in the complex. W9 has a similar relationship with O1 in the second ring. O1 is attached to the anomeric carbon. The moderate resolution of the PLacNAc structure and the location of O1 at the terminus of the second GlcNAc ring meant that the con®guration at the anomeric carbon could not be ascertained with absolute certainty. In PTant, O1 with a  con®guration appeared to ®t better, although both con®gurations were compatible with the electron-density map. W9 is Ê at an average distance of 1.0 A from the re®ned position of O1 in the  con®guration in this structure. The corresponding average distance from the re®ned position of O1 in the  Ê con®guration is 1.25 A. The average distances of W9 from O1 in the  con®guration in PLac and PLacNAc are 0.59 and Ê 1.36 A, respectively, while its distance from O1 in the  Ê con®guration in one of the PLac subunits is 2.3 A. Thus,

irrespective of the con®guration at the anomeric carbon, W9 in PMeGal is close to O1 in the second ring in the other three complexes. The occurrence of ordered water molecules in the unliganded form at positions corresponding to hydroxyl groups in the liganded form is also found in other carbohydrate-binding proteins. In particular, it has been shown that O3 and O4 of galactose at the primary binding site are replaced by water molecules in unliganded EcorL and GS4 (Elgavish & Shaanan, 1998; Delbaere et al., 1990, 1993). The material presented above demonstrates that the water molecules in the carbohydrate-binding region mimic the ligand to a substantial extent not only at the primary site, but also in the regions adjacent to it.
3.4. Comparison with the water structure in the combining sites of other Gal/GalNAc-speci®c lectins

Lactose, N-acetyllactosamine, methyl--galactose and the T-antigenic disaccharide, shown with the galactose moiety oriented in the same manner. The saccharide conformations are as they occur in the respective complexes with PNA.

Figure 4

Protein±carbohydrate interactions at the primary site are remarkably similar in Gal/GalNAc-speci®c lectins, although differences in detail exist (Banerjee et al., 1996; Prabu et al., 1998; Elgavish & Shaanan, 1998; Loris et al., 1998). It is, however, of interest to examine whether this similarity also extends to the water structure. The water molecules associated with the combining sites of PNA, W1 and W2 are of particular importance, as they bridge O2 of galactose to Glu129 OE1 and Gly104 N, respectively. A water molecule equivalent to W1, with a similar role, exists in the lactose, N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetyllactosamine complexes of EcorL (Elgavish & Shaanan, 1998), SBA (Dessen et al., 1995; Olsen et al., 1997) and GS4 (Delbaere et al., 1990, 1993), although an asparaginyl residue instead of a glutamyl residue interacts with the water

molecule. This asparaginyl residue is invariant in all legume lectins and is involved in a direct protein±carbohydrate hydrogen bond. A similar water site also exists in the methyl-galactose complex with WBAI, except that it is a little over Ê 4 A from galactose O2. An equivalent of W2, with a similar role, exists in WBAI±methyl--galactose and SBA. It occurs only in the lactose complex of EcorL. The position corresponding to W2 is occupied by a sugar atom in the complexes of GS4 (Delbaere et al., 1993). An equivalent water, however, exists in sugar-free GS4. Thus, the similarity of the PNA±sugar interactions with those in other Gal/GalNAc-speci®c lectins also extend to a substantial degree to water bridges.

between the group and the water molecule is most severe in PNA. In all the structures except PNA, however, there is the possibility of a compensating hydrogen bond between the O atom of the acetamido group and the main-chain N atom of a glycyl residue (107 in EcorL, 105 in WBAI, 106 in SBA and 107 in GS4). The nature of the combining site near the acetamido group in PNA is also different from that in the other four lectins. An invariant aspariginyl residue (Asn127 in PNA) and a glycyl residue are close to the C atoms of the acetamido group in all the ®ve lectins. The other residue close to the C atoms in PNA is Glu129. Tyr106, Tyr108 and Trp 135 are close to the C atoms in EcorL. Similar residues in WBAI, SBA and GS4 are Tyr106 and Trp130, Tyr107 and Trp132, and Phe108 and Trp138, respectively. Thus, favourable hydrophobic interactions with the acetamido group exist in EcorL, WBAI, SBA and GS4, but not in PNA. PNA understandably has nearly the same af®nity for galactose and methyl--galactose (Swamy et al., 1991; Young et al., 1984). It has higher af®nity for lactose on account of the additional hydrogen bonds the second ring makes with the lectin (Banerjee et al., 1996). The lectin binds the T-antigenic disaccharide still more strongly, primarily on account of the additional water bridges (Ravishankar et al., 1997, 1999). The reason for its lower af®nity for N-acetyllactosamine compared with that for lactose is not immediately obvious, as the protein±carbohydrate interactions in PLac and PLacNAc are the same. The acetamido group in PLacNAc points to the solution and the N-acetylglucosamine moiety has high displacement Figure 5 parameters. In fact, the average Stereo diagram of the water clusters (cyan), numbered in orange, in the binding site after superposition of atomic B factors for the atoms in the 16 subunits in the four complexes of PNA. The numbering in green is for the T-antigenic disaccharide Ê this moiety is as high as 141 A2, (pink). The N-acetyllactosamine is coloured red. The surrounding peptide stretches (yellow) are Ê 2 for the compared with 44.8 A numbered in white. Hydrogen bonds are represented by white dotted lines.

Structural data on protein±carbohydrate interactions and the corresponding thermodynamic data are notoriously dif®cult to correlate on a one-to-one basis (Toone, 1994), partly because the interatomic contacts seen in structures are more related to binding enthalpies than to free energies. The data, however, do provide a qualitative rationale for the observed speci®cities. Among the Gal/GalNAc-speci®c lectins, PNA is the only one which does not bind GalNAc at all (Swamy et al., 1991; Young et al., 1984). WBAI, EcorL and SBA bind Gal and GalNAc, although the af®nities are not the same for the sugars in each case (De Boeck et al., 1984; Schwarz et al., 1991; Surolia et al., 1996; Young et al., 1984). GS4 does not bind monosaccharides, but Gal and GalNAc can occur at the primary site. In order to facilitate comparison among them, the GalNAc moiety in the EcorL±GalNAc complex was built into the PNA binding site by superposition of the galactose ring in the EcorL±GalNAc complex and the PMeGal complex. Models of the GalNAc complex of WBAI, SBA and GS4 were similarly constructed. The water-mediated interaction between the protein and the sugar involving W2 is disrupted by the acetamido group in all the models. The short contacts

glucose moiety in PLac. The average value for the remaining Ê sugar atoms in PLacNAc and PLac are 34.6 and 28.8 A2, respectively. Thus, the exposed nature of the acetamido group and its consequent mobility appears to percolate to the sugar rings, rendering the binding of PNA to LacNAc weaker. The data were collected at the National Area-Detector Facility, supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). Facilities at the Supercomputer Education and Research Centre and the Interactive Graphics-based Facility and Distributed Information Centre (both supported by DBT) were used in the work. The work was funded by the DST.
