INTRODUCTION
ABSTRACT The debranching enzyme Nostoc punctiforme debranching enzyme (NPDE) from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme (PCC73102) hydrolyzes the a-1,6 glycosidic linkages of malto-oligosaccharides. Despite its high homology to cyclodextrin/pullulan (CD/PUL)-hydrolyzing enzymes from glycosyl hydrolase 13 family (GH-13), NPDE exhibits a unique catalytic preference for longer malto-oligosaccharides (>G8), performing hydrolysis without the transgylcosylation or CDhydrolyzing activities of other GH-13 enzymes. To investigate the molecular basis for the property of NPDE, we determined the structure of ° NPDE at 2.37-A resolution. NPDE lacks the typical N-terminal domain of other CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes and forms an elongated dimer in a head-to-head configuration. The unique orientation of residues 25­55 in NPDE yields an extended substrate binding groove from the catalytic center to the dimeric interface. The substrate binding groove with a lengthy cavity beyond the 21 subsite exhibits a suitable architecture for binding longer malto-oligosaccharides (>G8). These structural results may provide a molecular basis for the substrate specificity and catalytic function of this cyanobacterial enzyme, distinguishing it from the classical neopullulanases and CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes.

Cyclodextrin/pullulan (CD/PUL)-hydrolyzing enzymes include maltogenic amylases (EC 3.2.1.133), cyclodextrinases (EC 3.2.1.54), neopullulanases (EC 3.2.1.135), and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris a-amylase II (TVAII) that belong to the glycoside hydrolase 13 family. 1,2 This class of enzymes has broad substrate specificity and contains proteins that are able to hydrolyze starch and pullulan in addition to cyclodextrins (CDs) and malto-oligosaccharides. More importantly, these enzymes exhibit strong regioselective transglycosylation activity, forming a-(1,6)-glycosidic linkages using various sugar acceptors.2,3 CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes are widely distributed in nature and are key players in pullulan and amylopectin hydrolysis in microorganisms and animals.4 These enzymes share a high amino acid sequence homology, particularly in four highly conserved regions that are representative of the a-amylase family.5­7 Previously, we isolated and characterized a novel glycosyl hydrolase enzyme from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PC73102, designated Npun_R6073 (Genbank Accession No. Acc84362). NPDE shows a high amino acid sequence homology to the typical CD/ PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes (e.g., 41% to Thermus maltogenic amylase8 and 40% to Geobacillus stearothermophilus neopullulanase). Despite its high sequence homology to neopullulanase and other CD/PULhydrolyzing enzymes, the activity of NPDE differs significantly from that of the other enzymes in the GH-13 family. NPDE hydrolyzes both a-(1,4) - and a-(1,6)-glucosidic linkages with a substrate speciThis research was partially supported by the grant from the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF), funded by the Korean government.

ficity in the order of pullulan > amylopectin > starch > amylose.9 NPDE has no specificity for a-, b-, and gCDs, and hydrolyzes a-(1,6)-glucosidic linkages more rapidly than a-(1,4)-glucosidic linkages.9,10 NPDE appears to form dimer in solution, and the monomeric form has negligible catalytic efficiency compared to the dimer. Studies of the oligomerization state of NPDE in solution remain somewhat ambiguous.9 Kinetic and product analyses with various substrates have shown that NPDE is a debranching enzyme, rather than a CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzyme, and its catalytic efficiency is highly dependent on the length of its substrate.9 NPDE is capable of modulating amylopectin structures with relatively long side chains; chains shorter than G8 are resistant to NPDE hydrolysis, whereas chains longer than G8 are highly susceptible. Functional maltooligosaccharides with various degrees of polymerization can be used in industry because of their physicochemical properties, and production of malto-oligosaccharides with side chains longer than G6 are of interest for industrial applications.11,12 We performed a structural study on NPDE to elucidate the underlying mechanism of its unique catalytic functions and substrate specificity. In this study, we describe the crystal structure of ° NPDE at a resolution of 2.37 A. The structure of the native crystal, together with the crystal soaked in acarbose solution, reveals a unique dimeric configuration of NPDE. Furthermore, we found that the dimer interface is involved in the formation of the substrate binding groove and thus responsible for the distinctive properties of the active site. This result provides a molecular basis for the substrate specificity and the catalytic properties that distinguish the cyanobacterial enzyme NPDE from neopullulanase and other CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes in the GH-13 family.2,13 METHODS
Cloning and purification of NPDE

against 50 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and concentrated to 14 mg/mL before crystallization.15 The resulting protein was estimated to be >96% pure and homogeneous by SDS-PAGE.
Crystallization and data collection

The crystals were grown at 208C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method (screens from Hampton Research and Emerald Biosystems). We mixed 1.2 lL of a 14 mg/ mL NPDE solution in 50 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) with an equal volume of crystallization reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 200 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), and 100 mM MgCl2. In an attempt to obtain the acarbose complexed form, the crystal was soaked in 1 mM acarbose solution for 6 hours. For data collection at cryogenic temperatures, the crystals were transferred to a solution consisting of the mother liquor with the addition of 20% (v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data for the native crystal and the crystal soaked in acarbose solution were collected at the MX6C and MX4II beam lines, respectively, at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory.
Structure determination and refinement

The gene encoding NPDE (residues 1­488) was polymerase chain reaction amplified from the genome of N. punctiforme PCC73102 and cloned into recombinant Escherichia coli MC1061.14 The recombinant cells were cultured at 258C in Luria Bertani broth, and the cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole) and sonicated in an ice bath (VC-600; Sonics & Materials Inc.) to rupture the cells. The cell lysate was applied to Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) packed in a Poly-Prep Chromatography Column (Bio-Rad). The resin was washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole). Elution of the target protein was performed in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole). The protein was dialyzed

The diffraction data were processed and scaled with the program HKL 2000.16 The structure of the com° plexed NPDE at a 2.37-A resolution was initially solved by molecular replacement with Phaser17 in the CCP418,19 suite using the Bacillus stearothermophilus neopullulanase as a template molecule (Protein Data Bank code 1J0H). All refinement cycles were performed using CNS, and stereographic manual refinement was performed with COOT.20 The structure was validated with PROCHECK.12 Structure similarity searches were performed with Dali.21 Sequence alignments and structure-based sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW.22 Cartoon and sticks figures were produced with Pymol.23 Superimposition of the NPDE on other protein structures and the calculation of r.m.s.d. values were carried out with the program Swiss PDB Viewer.15 Statistics for the diffraction data and the final refined structures are given in Table I.
Molecular modeling

Malto-triose and isopanose ligands were modeled by using the malto-tetraose and isopanose molecules in the neopullulanase ligand complex structures (PDBcode 1J0J, 1J0K) from B. stearothermophilus as templates. The NPDE and ligand complex models were initially obtained by superposition of NPDE to the structure of neopullulanase. Initial complex models were subjected to energy minimization followed by 1 ps of molecular dynamics at 3008K after equilibration. They were finally minimized to a maximum derivative of 1.0 kcal per step by using the

region is oriented to the inside of the protein, forming one side of the substrate-binding cavity at the nonreducing end of the substrate polysaccharide. In NPDE, however, it is flipped away from the catalytic site and the loop region is involved in dimerization of NPDE and in the formation of the unique substrate binding groove (discussed later). NPDE has other additional insertion regions (e.g., residues 161­168 and residues 271­290). The C-terminal domain of NPDE (residues 310­488) exhibits an architecture that is similar to but smaller than that of neopullulanases or CDases consisting of a six-stranded antiparallel b-sandwich sheet [Fig. 1(b,c)]. Calcium ions or cysteine-linked disulfide bonds, commonly found in other amylases, were not observed in the NPDE structure.

Overall structural characteristics of NPDE

The crystal structure of NPDE was determined at 2.37° A resolution by molecular replacement using the catalytic domain of B. stearothermophilus neopullulanase as a template. The catalytic domain of NPDE displays the characteristic (b/a) eight-barrel fold of the GH-13 superfamily. A Dali21 search with the NPDE structure identified the neopullulanase from Thermus thermophilus (45% sequence identity) as its closest structural homolog with ° an r.m.s.d. of 1.06 A (398 Ca-atoms) and the neopullulanase from B. stearothermophilus (40% sequence identity) ° as the second closest homolog with an r.m.s.d. of 1.12 A (383 Ca-atoms) [Fig. 1(a,b)]. Despite high sequence identity, the overall monomeric structure of NPDE appears to differ from its related homologs. These differences are mainly caused by the absence of an N-terminal domain that is found in most of the CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes, such as neopullulanase, cyclodextrinase, and maltogenic amylases (Fig. 2). In the B. stearothermophilus neopullulanase (BSNPL), the N-terminal residues 1­123 form a discrete domain that is involved in dimerization and is connected to the catalytic domain. Without the conserved N-domain motif, NPDE shows a unique structure in the regions formed by residues 23­56, which protrude from the catalytic domain. In most of the CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes, this loop

NPDE forms a uniquely elongated dimer in which a two-fold rotation axis is found at the center of the dimer such that both active sites face in the same direction. The dimer appears as a long boat shape with an average ° ° length of 137 A and width of 58 A and is formed by the interaction of region A (residues 26­126 and 183­309) and region B (residues 127­182) of each monomer with the C-terminal domains placed at both ends [Fig. 1(b)]. This dimeric arrangement has not been observed in other CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes or in any other amylases.12,13 In the Sulfolobus TreX, the dimeric enzyme with a high structural similarity (z score 24.3) to NPDE, the dimer is formed in such a way that the monomers align side by side with their N-terminal domains facing in opposite directions.24 In contrast to TreX, the monomers in the NPDE dimer are arranged linearly in a headto-head configuration. The main dimeric interface is on helix 6 of region B (131­150), which makes polar interactions through a large hydrogen-bonding network (Gly100­Ala104, Glu187­Thr46, Asn14­Ser83, Gly131­ His90, and Arg130­Glu140) and two charge-charge interactions (Arg 31­Glu 194 and Arg 37­Asp 40). The polar interactions may explain why the dimer dissociates into monomer subunits at high salt concentrations.9 This polar association is supplemented by hydrophobic interactions through Phe132­135, Tyr161, Leu139, and Tyr169 [Fig. 3(a, b)]. Additional interactions in region A that are present only in NPDE also contribute hydrogen bonds (Gly27­Glu60, Leu32­Phe134, Leu33­Glu194, and Arg31­Met98) and form tight associations to produce a ° buried interface of 1514 A225 corresponding to 12% of the solvent-accessible surface per monomer. The estimated molecular size of NPDE is 2.8 times larger than that of the monomer found by gel permeation chromatography. This discrepancy might result from the long quaternary structure of NPDE [Fig. 3(c)].

Geometry of the NPDE active site

As a member of the amylase family, NPDE acts as a retaining enzyme to yield a product with a-anomeric configuration. Three catalytic residues (Asp210, Glu240, and Asp323), which are invariant and essential in GH-13 family enzymes, are located at the bottom of the active site cleft. These residues are identified as part of the regional conserved motif II, III, and IV of a-amylase, respectively. 3,13 Residues that form the deeply buried 21 subsite include Tyr87, His127, Trp172, Val211, and His322, with Tyr 87, known to be essential for substrate interaction in a-amylase, forming a hydrogen bond with Asp122 [Fig. 4 (a)]. To obtain a complex structure with an acarbose intermediate, the native crystal was soaked in a 1 mM acarbose solution. We failed to identify the ligand, and no obvious electron density fitting the acarbose molecule was observed in the active site. However, regions 367­371 and 459­470 cannot be modeled because of high regional flexibility in the presence of acarbose, which was clearly observed in the native structure. Because the region 367­ 371 forms part of the substrate binding groove, we

believe that the conformational changes observed in this structure may have resulted from the interaction with the sugar moieties in the acarbose molecule. To gain insight into the interaction of the a-1,4 linked and a-1,6 linked substrates at the active site, molecular models of the NPDE in complex with malto-triose and isopanose were constructed. Previously the complex structures of BSNPL with both a-1,4-glucosidic and a-1,6-glucosidic substrates have been reported.5 In the a1,6-linkage of the isopanose, the connected sugar residues are further apart than in the a-1,4-glucosidic linkage. In the model for the malto-triose complex, the reducing glucose unit of the substrate is held in position by Trp242, Trp172, and Arg283, whereas the second sugar ring could not make proper stacking interactions with Tyr 87 at subsite 21 for catalysis. Only the a-1,6-glucosidic linkage with a longer distance between the sugar rings and a kinked geometry appears to be able to fit and bind for catalysis in the model for the isopanose complex [Fig. 4(c,d)]. Given the strong electron density map of the side chain in both crystal structures and the apparent steric clash of the Trp242 horizontal side chain rotamer with the adjacent Asp284, the geometry of Trp242 side chain is

assumed to be the active configuration for substrate binding at the 11 subsite. The NH2 (g-NH2) of residue Arg283 forms a hydrogen bond with the OD2 of the catalytic residue Asp323, whereas the NE of Arg283 makes a second hydrogen bond with the OD2 of Asp284. NPDE strongly prefers the a-1,6-glucosidic linkage over the a1,4-glucosidic linkage as substrate.9 The extremely steep geometry and variable hydrogen-bonding network at the active site may be involved in this substrate discrimination [Fig. 4(b)].
A distinct substrate binding groove

The structure of NPDE shows an obvious groove ° across the molecule with an approximate length of 53 A ° that reaches from the catalytic and width of 12 A residues in the active site to the dimeric interface. In comparison, other CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes have a

relatively short groove blocked at the nonreducing end of the substrate binding, whereas the shape and architecture of the catalytic center appear to be the same with most of the residues in this region highly conserved among CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes26 [Fig. 5(a,b)]. The long and extended groove in NPDE mainly results from the unique orientation of the loop region of amino acids 23­ 56 and the additional structure of the dimeric interface. In NPDE, the dimerization yields a surface at the end of the groove consisting of residues Trp147, Trp150, Glu187, Glu190, Tyr191, Glu194, Glu197, and Tyr198 from one subunit and residues Leu33, Glu35, Glu39, Asp40, Ser43, Thr46, and Tyr50 from the other subunit [Fig. 5(a)]. Unlike its homologs, loop region 23­56 of NPDE protrudes away from the catalytic center with its topology stabilized by the charge-charge interactions between Arg 37 and Glu 190, and Lys 30 and Glu 103 yielding a long groove. This extended channel appears to bind the

substrate oligosaccharide because the region of residues 45­51, conserved among its homologs and involved in the substrate binding in CD/PUL homologs structures, is also positioned at the groove surface in NPDE [Fig. 5(c)].5,6,11 The primary question posed by the biochemical characterization of NPDE is why it has unique substrate specificity for malto-oligosaccharides longer than G8.9 The long extended groove comprised of several aromatic residues including Trp147, Tyr87, and Phe133 and polar residues including His144, Ser145, and His183 along the surface forms a suitable architecture to provide stable stacking interactions with the long sugar rings of the malto-oligo substrate. The subsite architecture of NPDE at subsite 11 and the long cavity groove extending beyond 21 subsite (22, 23, 24, and so on) may explain the unique hydrolysis pattern of removing the glucose unit from the reducing end for long malto-oligosaccharide substrate (>G8).
Atomic Coordinates

DISCUSSION NPDE is of special interest because of catalytic properties and a mode of action that differs significantly from its homologs, hydrolyzing mainly a-(1,6)-glucosidic linkages in the absence of transferring or CD hydrolyzing activity. An interesting feature of the NPDE structure is the absence of the N-terminal domain found in many CD/ PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes. The absence of the transferring activity of NPDE may be related to the absence of this N-terminal domain. Sequence alignments showed that an N-terminal motif with an average 120 amino acids is the characteristic feature of CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes. The N-terminal domain of one subunit is typically placed onto the substrate binding cleft of the other subunit and provides a structural lid to stabilize the acceptor molecule, which is essential for the transferase activity of these enzymes.5,11,24 For example, the neopullulanase from B. stearothermophilus forms a head-totail dimer with the N-terminal domain of one monomer, covering the catalytic cleft of the other monomer, thus providing the induced fit mechanism for the enzyme's transferase activity. However, the NPDE active site does not have a prominent structural lid to stabilize the acceptor molecule. This led us to postulate that the absence of the conserved N-terminal domain and

the altered dimeric arrangement of NPDE are responsible for its lack of transferase activity. Furthermore, NPDE lacks the typical tryptophan residue in the loop region at 142­185 that anchors cyclodextrin in the structure of the neopullulanase from Thermus Thermophilus and other homologs. This likely explains NPDE's inability to hydrolyze cyclodextrin. The observation that NPDE contains a long and extended substrate binding groove would explain the substrate specificity for longer oligosaccharide chain (>G8), discriminating it from other CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes that have a relatively small substrate binding groove. For the cleavage of the a-1,6-glucosidic linkage in debranching enzymes, the branched oligosacchrides would bind to the substrate groove in parallel mode with the a-1,6-glucosidic linkages at the catalytic center.27 The shape of the groove in NPDE appears to be of a suitable dimension for the binding of long branched oligosaccharide with several aromatic side chains for apolar pyranose rings and polar residues for hydroxyl groups. The postulation that a long substrate could bind tightly

with an extensive interaction is also consistent with biochemical kinetic data that show low Km values for substrates with chains longer than G8 and high Km values for shorter fragments.9 NPDE cleaves the amylopectin of longer distance between the a-(1,6)-glucosidic linkages much faster than the glycogen substrate of shorter glucose units between the branched points, supporting the involvement of the groove size in substrate specificity. It is interesting to find that NPDE dimerizes even without the typical N-domain that is involved in the dimerization of many CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes. It is well known that the substrate clefts of many a-amylase enzymes are formed by oligomerization.12,24,28 However, the dimeric arrangement identified here (an elongated boat shape in head-to-head contact with both active sites facing in the same direction) has not been previously reported. The involvement of dimerization in the formation of the substrate-binding cavity is consistent with the report that monomeric NPDE is unable to hydrolyze maltooligosaccharides.9 By adopting the dimeric configuration, NPDE may form

networks between the enzyme and the macromolecular substrate as indicated by the structure of the glycogen debranching enzyme TreX from Sulfolobus.24 A branched substrate cleaved at one site is likely to remain associated with the enzyme until the other branched point in the substrate is cleaved at another site leading to efficient progressive degradation of the branched substrates. The oligomeric arrangement of NPDE may facilitate the debranching action of the enzyme on the branched substrate. In conclusion, we report the structure of the debranching enzyme NPDE with an extended subsite structure in the absence of the N-terminal domain. NPDE forms a novel dimeric arrangement without a structural lid in the active site. These structural features would provide a molecular basis for the substrate specificity for longer branched oligosaccharide and for the absence of transglycosylation or CD hydrolyzing activity in NPDE, distin-

guishing this cyanobacterial enzyme from other classic CD/PUL-hydrolyzing enzymes in the GH-13 family. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the staff at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory beamlines HFMX4A and HFMX6C for data collection and technical assistance. REFERENCES
