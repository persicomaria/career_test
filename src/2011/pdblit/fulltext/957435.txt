Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (o-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatenicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidoreductase (phosphorylating), EC 1.2.1.12), isolated from rat skeletal muscle undergoes a rapid inactivation upon incubation at 25°C in the presence of adenine nucleotides. The reaction can be described as a reversible tetramerdimer equilibrium, only the tetrameric form of the enzyme being active in the presence of nucleotides. The standard free energy changes upon dissociation at 25°C in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.5 in the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP, ADP, AMP, and ADP-ribose were found to be 6.69, 6.93, 8.31, and 10.5 kcalimol, respectively. Nucleotide-dependent inactivation does not bring about any alteration of the reactivity of SH groups of the enzyme towards 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). This is not the case, however, when the enzyme undergoes NaCl-induced cold inactivation, which is accompanied by an increased accessibility of SH groups. ADP and ATP protect the enzyme against cold inactivation in the presence of NaCl and decrease the enhanced reactivity of SH groups. Adenine nucleotide-induced inactivation is prevented in the presence of NAD. The protective effect is noncooperative, the extent of inactivation being dependent upon the amount of active centers free of bound coenzyme. Addition of excess NAD to the inactivated enzyme results in a complete regain of activity. A comparative study made on the rate of reforming enzyme,NAD complex (followed spectrophotometrically) and the regain of activity has demonstrated that the former process is markedly more rapid than the latter. The reactivation was observed to follow second-order kinetics, which suggests that the reassociation of the inactive NADliganded dimers is the rate-limiting step. The data are consistent with the existence of different conformational transitions responsible for the restoration of the intersubunit contact area, catalytic activity, and thermal stability of the enzyme molecule, respectively.

The elucidation of the structural basis of cooperativity between subunits of tetramerit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [l-4] is one of the important problems in the study of this enzyme. Recent crystallographic data on lobster muscle holoenzyme revealed that the subunitsubunit contacts generated by the R, P, and Q axes of molecular symmetry markedly differ from each other, the strongest interactions occurring across the PP intersubunit domains (5). Solution studies on the enzyme dissociation is an alternative approach to the problem of subunit organization in the oligomer and to the relative contribution of interactions of different

kinds to the maintenance of the native conformation of the protein. An important aspect of the studies on enzyme dissociation under mild conditions is examination of enzymatic activity of the individual subunits. It seems of importance that the dissociation conditions should be elaborated so as to minimize the unspecific effects on the protein structure; this will help one to interpret the mechanism involved in the process. Adenine nucleotide-induced reversible inactivation and dissociation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been described for the enzyme isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle and from

yeast (6, 7). In both cases the effect was observed only at low temperature (WC), and rewarming of the enzyme solution caused reactivation even in the presence of ATP (7). In our studies on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isolated from rat skeletal muscle, we observed a destabilizing effect of monovalent anions on the enzyme structure, which results in inactivatlon and dissociation at low temperatures (8, 9). On the other hand, adenine nucleotide-dependent inactivation of this dehydrogenase appeared to develop readily in phosphate buffer at 25°C (10). This enabled us to study the effect of nucleotides without the interference of additional factors influencing the protein conformation, such as low temperature and monovalent anions. As shown in the present paper, the sLructura1 changes caused by NaCl and cold treatment of the enzyme are not observed in the course of the nucleotide-induced inactivation. The latter process has been studied in more detail.

Figure 1 shows the time course of inactivation of the apoenzyme caused by different adenine nucleotides. The dependence of the effect on nucleotide concentration studied previously (10) suggests that the inactivation rests upon the degree of saturation of enzyme active centers with nucleotide. The concentrations of nucleotides, used in the present work, were nearly saturating. Under the conditions of our experiments the nucleotide-dependent inactivation develops rapidly; a constant level of residual activity is achieved which is different for each nucleotide. This points to an equilibrium being established between inactive and active enzyme species. As shown previously (lo), on removing the nucleotide by

gel filtration the process may be fully reversed. The extent of inactivation at equilibrium shows a marked dependence on the protein concentration, as illustrated in our previous publication (10). Using the treatment of Holland and Westhead (151, we obtained a good correlation of our experimental data with the scheme T(active) ti 2D(inactive), where T and D represent the tetrameric and dimeric forms of the enzyme respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constants (K) were determined and found to differ depending on the nucleotide used as the dissociating agent. Since the inactivation is reversible, we can apply thermodynamic arguments and calculate the change of the standard free energy upon dissociation using the equation AGa = -RThU. The values corresponding to different conditions of dissociation are given in Table I. The relative effectiveness of various nucleotides as dissociating agents may be compared. From the data obtained in phosphate buffer it is clear that ADP is the most potent of the three adenine-containing NAD fragments tested. AMP is considerably less efficient, whereas ADP-ribose has only a negligible effect. ATP is more

effective than ADP, probably due to the extra charge of the molecule. Increasing the pH from 7.5 to 8.15 promoted dissociation. The effect of inorganic phosphate concentration is also seen in the table. The decrease in the dissociation constants obtained in the more concentrated phosphate buffer may be the result of a competition between nucleotide and inorganic phosphate for a common site on the enzyme. The competitive relationships between ATP and inorganic phosphate were demonstrated in the study of rabbit skeletal muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (16). In order to elucidate the influence of a monovalent anion on the character of nucleotide-dependent inactivation, the experiment illustrated in Fig. 2 was carried out. When incubation was performed at 25"C, the inactivation pattern was similar to that observed in Fig. 1. ATP is again more effective than ADP. In sharp contrast to the data obtained in phosphate buffer is, however, the effect of ADP-ribose. As seen in Fig. 2, curve 4, low concentrations of this nucleotide show no measurable effect, most probably being insufficient to form a complex with the en-

zyme. When the concentration is raised, the effect appears (curve 3). It is much more pronounced than the analogous effect observed in phosphate buffer (Fig. 1, Table I). Another peculiarity of the effect of ADPribose was revealed when the nucleotideinactivated samples were placed in the cold. Figure 2 shows that in the samples containing -4DP and ATP the level of residual activity remained constant (curves 1 and 2). This is not the case, however, when ADP-ribose is present (curves 3 and 4 I. The loss of activity due to cold inactivation is observed in the presence of both low and high concentrations of the nucleotide. The reaction follows pseudofirst-order kinetics with rate constants of 0.024 and 0.021 min' calculated for samples 3 and 4, respectively. The similarity of the rate constants indicates that the presence of saturating concentrations of ADP-ribose has no effect on the cold inactivation rate of' the dehydrogenase; sample 4 can serve as a control due to its very low concentration of the nucleotide. The absence of any decrease in activity upon lowering the temperature in samples containing ATP and ADP suggests that, in contrast to ADP-ribose, these nucleotides prevent the cold inactivation of the enzyme. Previously we have shown that NaCl-induced cold inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is com-

pletely prevented in the presence of inorganic phosphate bound at specific sites on the protein (9). Figure 3A shows that the effect of phosphate manifests itself by a marked decrease in the reactivity of the SH groups of the enzyme as compared with the samples containing NaCl. ADP proved to have a similar effect (Fig. 3A). One may suggest therefore that the mechanisms of enzyme protection against cold inactivation in both cases are similar. Figures 3B and C summarize the data on the reactivity of SH groups of the enzyme subjected to two types of inactivation: the NaCl-induced cold inactivation and the ADP-induced inactivation, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3B, the cold-inactivated sample is characterized by the increased accessibility of SH groups to the modifying agent, which suggests conformational changes affecting the microenvironment of cysteine residues of the protein. The effect of adenine nucleotides on the enzyme structure is different, as evidenced from Fig. 3C. It appears that cys teine residues of the inactivated enzyme species have the same reactivity towards 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as similar residues of the native tetramer. In conclusion we should like to note the complex character of the effect of ADP and ATP on the enzyme structure in a solution containing a monovalent anion a weaken-

Adenine nucleotide-induced inactivation is completely reversed upon removing the nucleotide by gel filtration (10). This mode of reactivation is a time-consuming process, hardly suitable for kinetic studies. We have therefore used an alternative method of reactivation, based on the displacement of the nucleotide by NAD. The characteristic absorption band in the 360400-nm spectral region, the "Racker band" (17), which appears upon NAD binding to the apoenzyme, was used to follow the enzyme . NAD complex formation. Figure 4 illustrates the time course of this process and that of the regain of enzymatic activity. One may see that the reactivation falls behind the binding of NAD to the enzyme. The latter process is over within 30-40 s. As compared with the anal-

seconds FIG. 4. Time course for the Racker band formation (1) and reactivation (2) of the enzyme induced by addition of NAD. Apoenzyme (0.8 mg/ml) was incubated in the buffer indicated in Fig. 1 in the presence of 10 mM ADP until a constant level of a residual activity was achieved. The reaction mixture was then placed in a spectrophotometric cell and a small aliquot of NAD solution was added (final concentration, 1.2 mM). The increase in optical density at 405-500 nm was followed (left ordinate). Enzymatic activity determinations was carried out in a parallel sample. The percentage of reactivation of the inactive part of the enzyme was calculated (right ordinste).

ogous data concerning the binding of NAD to the native apoenzyme, which is completed in a few milliseconds (18, 191, the interaction of dehydrogenase with NAD under the conditions of our experiments is rather slow. This may result from some alterations of the coenzyme binding site structure due to the nucleotide effect. In spite of this comparative slowness of the NAD-binding process, it is completed markedly earlier than the full regain of activity is achieved. We usually observed a 96 to 100% reactivation. These results suggest that all the protein species, including the tetramers remaining active, as well as the dissociation products devoid of activity, participate in the interaction with the coenzyme. If only active tetramers were able to interact with the coenzyme, the enzyme *NAD complex formation would not be accomplished before a complete reactivation of the enzyme occurred. The results shown in Fig. 4 point therefore to the binding of NAD with the inactive dimeric form of the enzyme. They suggest that the displacement of the adenine nucleotide by NAD is not the rate-determining step in the reactivation process. The restoration of the enzymatic activity depends on some other step. This ratedetermining step may be a conformational transition of an NAD-liganded dimer to the enzymatically active state, followed by a rapid reassociation to the tetramer. Another possibility is the slow process of reassociation of the inactive dimers to the active tetramer. In the former case the reactivation must follow first-order kinetics, and in the latter the regain of activity is expected to obey second-order kinetics. To choose between these two possibilities we studied the kinetics of the reactivation process. Figure 5A shows the reactivation pattern at two different protein concentrations. For kinetic analysis of the results we have used the equation (20): t/f = (l/kA,J + (d/2),

in which f is the degree of conversion for time t, n is the reaction order, A,, is the initial concentration of the reactant and k is the rate constant. The slope of a plot of tl f against t is equal to one-half the reaction

Figure 5B shows the plot used for the determination of the rate constants and the order of the reactivation reaction studied with two different protein concentrations. Using our experimental data we obtained a value close to 2 in both cases studied. The rate constants, procured from the intercepts on the ordinate were found to be 0.75 x lo6 and 1.75 x lo6 M-' min' for protein concentrations of 0.124 and 0.289 mg/ml, respectively. It appears therefore that the rate-limiting step of reactivation of the enzyme in the presence of NAD is a second-order reaction. This observation strongly suggests that the regain of activity under the experimental conditions used is determined by the reassociation of the enzymatically inactive dimers into tetramer. The first step of reactivation is supposed to consist in a conformational transition in the dimeric species induced by NAD binding, which makes them capable of reassociating. This change is fast as compared with the following reassociation step, which therefore becomes rate limiting. As shown in Fig. 6, the fully reactivated dehydrogenase differs from the native enzyme in thermostability, which suggests that these proteins have nonidentical conformation. The difference disappears after a 17-min incubation of the reactivated enzyme. This seems to indicate that the conformational transition of the reassociated

able excess. The effect of a partial saturation of the active centers with NAD can be seen in Fig. 7, which illustrates the protective effect of the coenzyme. The data show that the extents of maximal inactivation of the dehydrogenase containing one or two firmly bound NAD molecules per tetramer are 45 and 27%, respectively, as compared to 60% in the control sample. This is to be expected if each subunit free from bound NAD were affected by inactivation.

Figure 8 is a schematic representation of the possible steps involved in the nucleotide-induced inactivation of the enzyme and the process of reactivation which is consistent with the effects observed under conditions employed in the present study. The active apoenzyme is converted into an enzymatically active intermediate tetramerit species, reaction I, upon interaction with adenine nucleotides. This species exists in a conformationally altered state, which is characterized by the weakened intersubunit contacts. Several lines of evidence point to the nucleotide-induced conformational changes in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . Adenine nucleotides were observed to decrease the enzyme stability in studies on the o-phenanthroline or free fatty acid-induced inactivation of the dehydrogenase (21,221, as well as to enhance the accessibility of the protein to proteolysis (23). Some alterations in optical characteristics of the enzyme were also observed (7, 241, which precede the inactivation and dissociation (24).

Apoenzyme, 0.3 mg/ml in the buffer indicated in Fig. 1, was incubated in the presence of 10 mM ADP. (l), No additions; (2 and 3), 1 and 2 equiv of NAD were added per mole of enzyme, respectively.

The nonidentical values of equilibrium constants found for the tetramer dissociation in the presence of saturating concentrations of AMP, ADP, ATP, and ADPribose, respectively (step II), suggest the different extent of conformational changes induced by these nucleotides. Not much can be said, however, about the factors which determine the effectiveness of various nucleotides. Electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged ligand and some group of the active center (6, 23) is probably one of the constituents of the complex system of interactions contributing to the conformational transition. Other factors, such as orientation of the ligand in the nucleotide-binding site seem to be of importance. ADP-ribose and NAD do not differ in the charge of the pyrophosphate group; they have, nevertheless, an opposite effect on the intersubunit contact area. The most striking is the difference revealed in experiments when 0.15 M NaCl was used. The different character of conformational changes accompanying the NaClinduced cold inactivation, on one hand, and the adenine nucleotide-dependent inactivation, on the other, makes one suppose that the nonidentical patterns of tetrameric dissociation are involved in both cases, although the relative contribution of the three types of intersubunit contact area revealed by crystallographic studies (5) cannot be appreciated.

Adenine nucleotide-induced inactivation is readily reversed upon removing the nucleotide by gel filtration (6). The reactivation may proceed in this case via steps III and IV of the scheme in Fig. 8, that is, the restoration of the native structure of the dimers followed by their reassociation. No study of reactivation kinetics could be performed, however, making steps III and IV hypothetical. At the present time we have no experimental evidence of the existence of enzymatically active dimers in solution, although such a possibility seems to be fairly probable (10, 25). A more detailed investigation has been carried out on enzyme reactivation induced by addition of NAD and possibly proceeding by a different mechanism. The experimental data are consistent with a series of subsequent steps involved in the reactivation, which are schematically represented in Fig. 8. The interaction of NAD wit.h a dimer induces some conformational alterations at the region of intersubunit contact area. This fast step (V) results in the appearance of dimeric species, which remain inactive, but readily reassociate into the enzymatically active tetramer (step VI). The reassociation process is a rate-limiting step of the reactivation. The enzymatically active conformation may appear either by mere association of the dimers or as a result of some fast structural transitions following the tetramer formation. According to the scheme described, the inactive dimers are supposed to exist in one of the two conformations, differing in the state of the subunit contact area. The first, is induced by adenine nucleotides, the second by the coenzyme. The strengthening of the intersubunit contacts, effected by NAD binding, appears to surpass the restoration of enzymatic activity. The latter process is, in its turn, slower than the reforming of the stable protein conformation (see Fig. 7). It may be concluded that the reactivation process, observed under the conditions of our experiments, comprises a series of conformational transitions, the fastest of which results in the restoration of interdimerit contacts, and the slowest is responsi-

ble for the reforming structure.
