Kinetically stable proteins are unique in that their stability is determined solely by kinetic barriers rather than by thermodynamic equilibria. To better understand how kinetic stability promotes protein survival under extreme environmental conditions, we analyzed the unfolding behavior and determined the structure of Nocardiopsis alba Protease A (NAPase), an acid-resistant, kinetically stable protease, and compared these results with a neutrophilic homolog, -lytic protease (LP). Although NAPase and LP have the same number of acid-titratable residues, kinetic studies revealed that the height of the unfolding free energy barrier for NAPase is less sensitive to acid than that of LP, thereby accounting for NAPase's improved tolerance of low pH. A comparison of the LP and NAPase structures identified multiple salt-bridges in the domain interface of LP that were relocated to outer regions of NAPase, suggesting a novel mechanism of acid stability in which acid-sensitive electrostatic interactions are rearranged to similarly affect the energetics of both the native state and the unfolding transition state. An acid-stable variant of LP in which a single interdomain salt-bridge is replaced with a corresponding intradomain NAPase salt-bridge shows a dramatic > 15-fold increase in acid resistance, providing further evidence for this hypothesis. These observations also led to a general model of the unfolding transition state structure for LP protease family members in which the two domains separate from each other while remaining relatively intact themselves. These results illustrate the remarkable utility of kinetic stability as an evolutionary tool for developing longevity over a broad range of harsh conditions.

ordinarily harsh conditions, including extremely hot, acidic, or proteolytic environments.1,2 Elucidating the mechanisms by which these proteins attain such remarkable stability is important for understanding both protein folding3 and optimal engineering strategies.4 Most studies are complicated by the complex, global reaction of protein structure to extreme conditions, such as high temperature.1,5 However, because acid affects protein structure at discrete distinct and specific loci, a mechanistic understanding of acidophilic adaptation can be achieved by focusing on the local environment of acid-titratable moieties in the structure of an acidophile.

871 structured native state and the unstructured unfolded state determines global protein stability. We hypothesize that these different stability mechanisms provide unique opportunities that kinetically stable proteins can exploit when developing resistance to extreme conditions. To understand the interplay between kinetic stability and acid resistance, we focused on the wellunderstood, kinetically stable bacterial proteases of the chymotrypsin superfamily. These proteases display extraordinarily slow folding (t1/2,folding = 1800 years30 for LP and 3 days for SGPB31) and unfolding rates (t1/2,unfolding = 1.2 years for LP30 and 11 days for SGPB31). Remarkably, the LP native state is actually less stable than unfolded forms by an unprecedented  4 kcal/mol.30 To facilitate folding on a biological timescale, these proteases have coevolved a covalently attached pro region that catalyzes the folding of the protease.31­33 After folding has completed, the pro region is proteolytically destroyed, yielding the kinetically trapped native protease.34 Importantly, the transient involvement of the pro region uncouples the folding and unfolding landscapes, which allows evolution of unique and beneficial native state properties.35 For example, the LP and SGPB native states are extremely rigid, which limits both global and local unfolding processes, thereby significantly reducing their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation and increasing functional lifetime.31,36 Nocardiopsis alba Protease A (NAPase), from the bacterium Nocardiopsis sp. strain TOA-1, which was isolated from a bathroom tile joint,37 was identified as a secreted, keratinolytic protease with considerable stability under acidic conditions.37 The strong sequence homology with LP (44% identical, 64% homologous; see Figure 1) and the presence of a very similar pro region provide key hallmarks to identify NAPase as a kinetically stable protease. In the studies presented here, we find that NAPase unfolds more slowly than LP at high temperature and that

Acidophilic proteins must have mechanisms in place to counter the buildup of large net positive charge due to neutralization of carboxylates,6 the loss of carboxylate mediated salt-bridges,7,8 and, at moderately acidic pH, the protonation of buried histidines.9­12 Many acidophilic proteins, such as pepsin,13 xylanase from Aspergillus kawachii,14 the soxF protein from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius,15 and the acid-tolerant killer toxin from Pichia farinosa,16 have actually evolved an overabundance of acidic surface residues, thus reducing their overall pI and their net positive charge at any pH. While this strategy increases stability at low pH by reducing positive electrostatic repulsion, there is a large increase in negative electrostatic repulsion and corresponding reduction in stability at neutral and alkaline pH.17­20 Additional strategies include reducing the overall number of charged residues as well as the solvent accessibility of acidic residues (as in acidophilic maltose binding protein from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius 21 and N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide mutase from Acetobacter aceti22) and the binding of metal or cofactors (as in rusticyanin from Thiobacillus. ferrooxidans23,24). All of these mechanisms have been identified in proteins whose functional stability is presumably dictated by their thermodynamic stability (difference in free energy between the native and unfolded states), GN-U. However, for a growing list of proteins, including capsid protein SHP,25 lipase,26 pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase,27 subtilisin BPN,28 -lytic protease (LP),29,30 and its homolog Streptomyces griseus Protease B (SGPB),31 it has been shown that persistence of the native state is dictated not by GN-U, but by the height of their unfolding free energy barrier (GN-TS), which acts to kinetically trap the native state. The functionally relevant states for kinetically stable proteins are the native and transition states, both of which can be well structured. Conversely, in thermodynamically stable proteins, the differential stability between the

872 the unfolding of NAPase is less sensitive to acidic conditions, resulting in a significantly enhanced functional lifetime at low pH. However, unlike other acid stable enzymes, NAPase has the same total number of acidic residues (six) as its acid labile counterpart, LP. A structural and mutational comparison of NAPase and its acid-labile homolog, LP, simultaneously provides strong evidence for a novel mechanism of acid resistance through charge migration and leads to a new model of the unfolding transition state structure for these proteases.

Results
Unfolding at high temperature As a first step toward characterizing the NAPase energetic landscape, we measured its unfolding rate at 70 °C and pH 5. It is possible to avoid the confounding pH and chemical effects typical of using other denaturants by using high temperature to accelerate the unfolding reaction. The rate of tertiary structure loss as measured by protease activity (1.31(± 0.05) × 10- 4 s- 1; Figure 2(a)) closely parallels the rate of secondary structure loss as measured by circular dichroism (1.61(± 0.05) × 10- 4 s- 1; Figure 2(b)), consistent with a two-state unfolding reaction. The rate of LP unfolding under identical conditions, as measured by loss of protease activity and fluorescence, is 2.47(± 0.01) × 10- 3 s- 1. This is 17 times faster than that of NAPase (Figure 2(a)), showing that the unfolding of NAPase is less sensitive to high temperature than LP. NAPase is more acid-resistant than LP Because NAPase has previously been shown to be qualitatively resistant to acid,37 we quantified the effect of varying pH on the unfolding rates of both NAPase and LP. To accurately determine unfolding rate constants, we chose temperatures (LP 60 °C, NAPase 70 °C) where the unfolding halftimes were similar for LP (t1/2  4.7 h) and NAPase (t1/2  1.3 h). The pH dependence of unfolding differed substantially between LP and NAPase (Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 1). The unfolding rate of NAPase is relatively insensitive to low pH; at pH 2.0, NAPase unfolds only  20-fold faster than at pH 5.0, whereas at pH 12 it is accelerated  175-fold. In contrast, the rate of LP unfolding is extremely sensitive to low pH ( 400-fold faster at pH 2.5 than at pH 5.0). In fact, unfolding of LP at pH 2.0 was so fast (t1/2 < 15 s) as to prevent determination of an accurate unfolding rate constant using manual mixing to initiate unfolding. Thus, at pH 2.5, LP is  80-fold more acid sensitive than NAPase (relative acid sensitivity=(kpH2.5, LP/kpH5, LP)/ (kpH2.5, NAPase/kpH5, NAPase)). Altogether, NAPase is extraordinarily resistant to extremes of both heat and acid; the t1/2 for unfolding at pH 2.5 and 70 °C is

The data are fit using a single exponential equation yielding similar rate constants of 1.31(±0.05) × 10-4 s-1 and 1.61(± 0.05) × 10-4 s-1, respectively, suggesting unfolding by a two-state mechanism. As shown in (a), LP (squares, dashed line) unfolds under identical conditions with a rate constant of 2.46(±0.01) × 10-3 s-1.

a remarkable 15.5 min, while for LP it is estimated to be  0.7 s, a  1300-fold difference in unfolding rate under identical conditions. To obtain insight into the nature of the unfolding cooperativity of NAPase as a function of pH, we analyzed the resistance to proteolysis of LP and NAPase. No matter how protease resistant the native state, local as well as global unfolding can lead to proteolytic accessibility and hence inactivation. In principle, unfolding cooperativity could be so extreme as to completely suppress local fluctuations so that only global unfolding events lead to proteolytic destruction. Indeed, proteolysis has been shown to be a useful tool for examining subglobal fluctuations of proteins in a manner analogous to hydrogen exchange experiments. 38­40 Proteolytic susceptibility is conveniently determined using a "survival assay,"31,36 in which multiple proteases are mixed together in equimolar ratios at 37 °C and proteolysis is allowed to proceed.

Like other Pro region dependent proteases of this family,42­46 NAPase is distinguished from the classical chymotrypsin fold by two structural elements: (i) a small -hairpin (termed the "domain bridge") that connects the N- and C-terminal -barrels (residues 120A to 120L) and (ii) a larger -hairpin in the C-terminal domain (residues 156 to 185), shown to be an integral site for Pro region binding and folding catalysis.32,33,47 As expected from the high level of sequence conservation, the overall structure of NAPase is extremely similar to that of LP42 (C RMSD = 1.2 and 1.1 Å for NAPase molecules A and B, respectively; see structural overlay in Supplemental Figure 1).

Figure 3. Effect of pH on unfolding rate for LP (green) and NAPase (violet). The bar heights represent the increase in unfolding rate relative to pH 5.0. Unfolding was followed by circular dichroism and/or loss of protease activity. Unfolding was triggered by high temperature: 60 °C for LP and 70 °C for NAPase. The LP unfolding rate at pH 2.0 (denoted by asterisk) is a lower limit.

NAPase, and trypsin have orthogonal substrate specificities (data not shown), one can readily measure the amount of active protease remaining over time by measuring the activities of each enzyme using three different chromogenic substrates, each of which is specific for a different protease. The results for the survival assay at pH 7.0 and 37 °C (Figure 4(a)) show that LP outlasts NAPase by a factor of  2, a significant difference considering the impressive longevity of both of these prodependent proteases. The loss of trypsin activity is faster by factors of about 20 and 10 than the rates of degradation for LP and NAPase, respectively. In contrast, the survival assay at pH 2.5 shows an opposite trend for LP and NAPase (Figure 4(b)). While the degradation rates at pH 2.5 for both proteases are increased relative to those at neutrality, the t1/2 of LP inactivation is 1.4 ± 0.2 days while that for NAPase is 12 ± 6 days, or roughly a 9-fold difference in inactivation rates. This result illustrates that the superior ability of NAPase to resist acidic conditions extends over a broad range of temperatures and in highly proteolytic environments. The structure of NAPase To gain insight into the mechanisms generating acid stability in NAPase, we determined the structure of NAPase by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.85 Å (Table 1). There were two identical copies of NAPase in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (C RMSD = 0.20 Å), and all atoms of the protein were visible in electron density maps with the exception of two arginine side-chains past the C atoms (Arg220 and 241 [residues numbered as described by chymotrypsin homology using the

(a) At pH 7.0, NAPase is degraded about 2-fold faster than LP but about 10-fold slower than trypsin (kdeg, LP, pH7 = 1.4(±0.3) × 10- 7 s- 1, kdeg, NAPase, pH7 = 3.1(± 0.6) × 10- 7 s- 1, kdeg, tryspin, - 6 s- 1 ).

NAPase and LP pH 7 data were fit to a linear model, whereas trypsin and LP pH 2.5 data were fit with a single exponential equation.

bridge of NAPase most closely resembles that of a thermophilic homologue, Thermobifida fusca Protease A (TFPA) (B.A.K. and D.A.A., submitted). Preliminary studies suggest that the domain bridge and its packing interactions may contribute to the greater thermostability of TFPA and NAPase (B.A.K. and D.A.A., submitted). Electrostatic features of the NAPase structure The structure of NAPase provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms of acid resistance through comparing its electrostatic attributes with those of the homologous, yet acid-labile, LP. NAPase and LP have the exact same number of acidic residues (six) and a comparable percentage of positive residues (NAPase, 6.91%; LP, 7.58%), which is inconsistent with the two previously identified general mechanisms for acid stability.14­16,21,22 Similarly, metal binding site effects proposed to stabilize the T. ferrooxidans rusticyanin in acid23,24 are irrelevant for NAPase, which contains no metals or other cofactors (as evidenced by its structure), suggesting that NAPase utilizes a unique strategy for acid stability. In the relevant pH range (<5.0), LP and NAPase each contain seven acid-titratable moieties (six acidic residues and the C-terminal carboxylate) and form a similar number of salt-bridges (seven in NAPase, eight in LP; Table 2). Two of these residues (Asp102 and Asp194) are critically important for catalytic function50­55 and are conserved in nearly all chymotrypsin family serine proteases and thus are unlikely to be relevant for acid stability. The remaining five carboxylates occupy different positions in both the primary sequence (Figure 1) and the tertiary structure (Figure 5) and are thus good candidates for the differential low pH stability of LP and NAPase. In LP, all carboxylates are located at or near the interface between the N and C-domains, whereas in NAPase only the C terminus is located near this interface (Figure 5).

Despite the strong structural homology, there are regions in which the backbone traces of NAPase and LP significantly deviate (Supplemental Figure 1). The largest backbone change occurs at a loop in the C-terminal domain (residues 216 to 225). The extended loop found in LP is unique in the subfamily and has been shown to play a role in dictating substrate specificity.48,49 Nearly all other Pro region dependent family members, including NAPase, have a much smaller and more conserved loop. Given its high degree of conservation it is unlikely that this loop would be the key to NAPase's unique acid resistance. Another region of NAPase with large backbone changes relative to LP is the "domain bridge," a -hairpin that connects the N- and C-terminal domains (residues 120A to 120L). At both a structural and a sequence level, the domain

Figure 5. Distribution of acidic residues in (a) LP (green) and (b) NAPase (violet). Nonconserved acidic residues are shown in red (ball and stick models). Compared to LP, the acidic residues of NAPase have migrated away from the domain interface.

Despite strong overall sequence conservation for residues in the region of the domain interface, the distribution of charges, both negative and positive, across this interface is strikingly different between LP and NAPase (Figure 6). In particular, all of the interdomain salt-bridges in LP (37.5% of the total salt-bridges) are replaced with hydrophobic or polar interactions in NAPase, which has no interdomain ion pairs at all (Figure 6). Additionally, the NAPase ion pairs involve residues that are close in primary sequence (average sequence separation=20 residues), whereas those in LP are significantly more distant (average sequence separation=78 residues). In fact, NAPase has three salt-bridges involving adjacent residues (Asp15B-Nterm, Glu88AArg89, and Cterm-Arg243), while LP contains none (Table 2). Salt-bridge relocation mutant To further investigate the role of this alternate distribution of salt-bridges in acid stability, we mutated three residues in LP to relocate electrostatic interactions within the protease. We converted an interdomain salt-bridge (Glu32 with Arg141) to those residues found in NAPase (Glu32Ala32, Arg141 Ser141), therefore abolishing this salt-bridge and simultaneously recreating a NAPase intradomain ion pair (Nterm with Asp15B) within LP (Asn15BAsp) to conserve the total number of ion pairs (Relocation Mutant; Figure 7(a)). The location of the replacement salt-bridge was chosen so as to be far from other LP ionic groups to avoid introducing spurious electrostatic interactions. The Relocation Mutant unfolds  6-fold faster than WT-LP at pH 5.0 and 60 °C (Supplemental Table 1), indicating that the overall unfolding free energy barrier has been lowered. However, when the acid sensitivity of the unfolding rate was examined, the Relocation Mutant was much less sensitive to acid, having only a  60-

fold acceleration at pH 2.0 relative to pH 5.0 (Figure 7(b)). Altogether, the Relocation Mutant is  20-fold more acid stable than WT-LP at pH 2.0 and  15fold more stable at pH 2.5 (increase in acid stability= (kpH5, mutant/klow pH, mutant)/(kpH5, WT/klow pH, WT); Figure 7(b)).

Discussion
Acid resistance via kinetic stability For both LP and NAPase, the rate of protein unfolding is the sole determinant of functional "stability." While NAPase does exhibit enhanced high temperature resistance, as evidenced by a slower unfolding rate at 70 °C (Figure 2(a)), here we focus on understanding the much larger difference ( 80-fold) in the sensitivity of the unfolding rates to acid (Figure 3). As shown, the reduced responsiveness of the unfolding free energy barrier to low pH directly translates into enhanced longevity for NAPase under very acidic conditions (Figure 4(b)). Because the NAPase unfolding rate does not increase significantly with acidification (Figure 3), low pH must either (1) not perturb the energetics of the native (N) and transition states (TS) or (2) alter the energetic of both states to a similar extent, such that the relative energy difference remains essentially unchanged (Figure 8(a)). Although we do not know what the effect of acid is on the stability of N with respect to U, it does not matter for NAPase longevity and function. The unfolding free energy barrier still retains the same height; thus, NAPase is kinetically acid stable (Figure 8(a)). In contrast, the pronounced acid sensitivity observed for LP indicates that exposure to acid has a significant differential effect on N and TS (Figure 8(b)), resulting in a reduced unfolding free energy barrier.

(b) Formal charge is displayed on the surface of the buried domain interfaces for LP (top) and NAPase (bottom), revealing areas of positive (blue) and negative (red) electrostatic potential. Circles highlight residues in interdomain salt-bridges of LP that are absent in NAPase. Each salt-bridge pair is denoted by different colored circles. Electrostatic potentials were calculated and displayed using ccp4MG.78,79

This mechanism stands in marked contrast to the acid-stabilization strategies used by thermodynamically stable proteins, which include minimizing electrostatic repulsion (by increasing the number of carboxylates and thereby lowering the pI)13­16 or reducing the number of carboxylates and thus reducing the magnitude of the pH-dependent effect.21,22 However, a major consequence is that protein stability is often seriously compromised at neutral pH.17­20 This is illustrated in the schematic energy landscape diagrams in Figure 8(c), where trypsin (stable at neutral pH) and pepsin (stable at low pH) are contrasted at both low and neutral pH. Given the previous data on acid stability mechanisms, it was surprising to see that NAPase

is not exceptionally sensitive to neutral or basic conditions (Figure 3) and that both NAPase and LP have the same number of acid titratable groups and a very similar number of salt-bridges at neutral pH. Increased salt-bridge content also seems to be correlated with thermostability,56 yet this correlation also does not hold for LP and NAPase. Taken together, these behaviors show that NAPase must employ a very different acid stability mechanism and indicate that this is a likely consequence of its kinetic stability. This raises several key questions: (1) What is the mechanism of NAPase's extraordinary acid stability? (2) What can this information tell us about the structural origins of kinetic stability? and (3)

Structural and Mechanistic Basis of Acid Stability

877 (see below). Furthermore, the salt-bridges in NAPase (all intradomain) occur between residues that are much more local in terms of the primary sequence of the protein (i.e., low contact order57) than in LP (Table 2). In fact, NAPase has three saltbridges involving adjacent residues, whereas LP has no such interactions. These highly localized ion pairs are more likely to remain interacting in the TS due to their close sequence proximity. Therefore, their electrostatic interaction energy will tend to be closely matched between the N and TS, so that acidinduced salt-bridge destabilization would have minimal effects on the height of the unfolding free energy barrier (Figure 8(b)). Because these ion pairs are likely interacting in both N and TS, they actually would provide no net kinetic stabilization, but may be present to increase protein solubility. Conversely, the acid sensitivity of LP suggests that its saltbridge arrangement must be significantly disrupted between N and TS. A model for the transition state of kinetically stable proteases The presence of interdomain, acid-labile saltbridges in LP, but not NAPase, would suggest that the interactions along this interface are broken during the N-to-TS transition. Consequently, acidinduced disruption of LP's interdomain saltbridges would destabilize N but would have a lesser effect on the energetics of the TS. In NAPase, by contrast, relocation of acid-labile interactions away from the interface would make the N-to-TS transition relatively insensitive to acid, since the N and TS states would be affected equally. To further test the role of interdomain salt-bridges in LP, we used NAPase as a guide for relocating one of the three LP interdomain salt-bridges to the periphery (Figure 7(a)). The mutation was surprisingly potent, accounting for more than 60% of the differential acid stability of LP and NAPase despite representing less than 3% of their sequence variation. These data strongly support the proposal that interdomain salt-bridges must be broken in the LP TS. These results provide critical information on the global TS structure for LP. Previously, it was proposed that there must be a relatively large change in exposed surface area but relatively little change in structure 58 to explain the favorable enthalpy and unfavorable entropy of the N-to-TS transition.35 Further, an analysis of the change in solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface area during unfolding showed that the TS is very native-like ( 80% native).58 These results dictate a TS structure in which there is significant ordering of solvent without a large loss of protein structure. Combining this with our new salt-bridge data suggests an LP TS model in which both -barrel domains separate from each other but remain relatively intact themselves, allowing water molecules to become ordered in the newly made crevice between the two domains (Figure 9).

Glu32 and Arg141 are mutated to Ala and Ser, respectively, abolishing this interdomain saltbridge (shown in green). Asn15B is mutated to Asp to create a new, intradomain ion pair with the N terminus (orange), as found in NAPase. (b) Effect of low pH on the unfolding rate of the Relocation Mutant. The Relocation Mutant (orange) is > 15-fold more acid stable than LP (green) and approaches that of NAPase (violet). The LP unfolding rate at pH 2.0 (denoted by asterisk) is a lower limit.

How can it remain stable over such a broad pH range? Acid stability through salt-bridge migration Our structural analysis indicates that, despite the proteins' overall conservation, the locations of saltbridges in LP and NAPase are very different. Foremost, in NAPase there is a migration of acidsensitive residues (Figure 5), and therefore saltbridges (Figure 6), away from the interface of the N and C domains. This result suggests that the domain interface plays a key role in the N-to-TS transition

Figure 8. Qualitative schematic illustrating the effect of acid on the NAPase unfolding free energy barrier (a) and different strategies for acidophilic behavior in (b) kinetically and (c) thermodynamically stable proteins. Free energies are displayed at both neutral (black) and at low (red) pH. (a) NAPase is kinetically acid-stable. Because the unfolding free energy barrier maintains the same height at neutral and low pH, acid must either not perturb the energetics of the NAPase N and TS (first set of dashed lines) or alter the energetics to a similar extent (second set of dashed lines). However, acid is expected to destabilize the native state, so we have displayed it as such in the following diagram. (b) In kinetically stable proteins, there are differential effects on the TS of an acidophile (NAPase) versus a neutrophile (LP). The TS of LP is not destabilized by acid as greatly as N, which decreases the unfolding free energy barrier, whereas the TS of NAPase is destabilized to roughly the same degree as N, thereby maintaining the unfolding free energy barrier height across a wide pH range. (c) At neutral pH, trypsin is quite stable, whereas pepsin is destabilized. The reverse is true at acidic pH.

As further corroboration, preliminary results from molecular dynamics simulations of LP unfolding suggest that interactions along the domain interface are among those predominantly broken during the N-to-TS transition (N. Salimi and D.A.A., unpub-

lished results). Finally, the proposed TS structure could also help explain LP's overall resistance to proteolysis,36 because the protein only enters a protease-susceptible conformation (i.e., exposure of loops) after it has globally unfolded. This relatively

Structural and Mechanistic Basis of Acid Stability

879 Kinetic stability provides the potential for rapid evolutionary change to accommodate environmental changes and therefore can be viewed as a flexible paradigm for attaining extraordinary longevity in extremely harsh environments and over broad ranges of conditions.

well-folded TS may have been evolved to protect the protease from proteolysis, illustrating how the details of a folding landscape can have important implications for protein function. While the majority of our data provide structural insights into the LP TS, several factors argue that the model should be broadly applicable to other kinetically stable family members. First, the structural data presented here demonstrate that the native states are very similar. Second, it has been demonstrated that the folding pathways of homologous proteins within several protein families are quite similar.59­68 Third, where examined, the folding transition states for kinetically stable LP family members have been found to be quite compact and very native-like.36,69 Fourth, the LP folding TS seems to be a highly specific and very resilient structure. Mutations effect the catalyzed (i.e., in the presence of the pro region) and uncatalyzed folding reactions equivalently even though their rates differ by > 109 .70 Together these data provide strong support for a TS structural model (Figure 9) that pertains not only to LP but also to NAPase and other kinetically stable family members. Kinetic stability facilitates protein adaptation While most acidophilic proteins have evolved to reside solely in low pH environments (and, therefore, don't need to survive and/or function under neutral or alkaline conditions; Figure 8(b)), NAPase is most active at neutral or high pH and normally exists in an environment (tile grout) that is quite basic.37 However, as with many biofilm forming microorganisms, N. alba and other Nocardiopsis species can greatly acidify their environment in response to certain nutrients.71 Thus, the creation of a local, and perhaps transient, low pH environment around the colony could necessitate the development of secreted proteins like NAPase that are capable of retaining activity and stability at both high and low pH. Unlike most other adaptations involving alterations in number of acid titratable groups, the combination of kinetic stability and salt-bridge migration provides stability over a large pH range. Since the unfolded state (U) is inconsequential for stability, a kinetically stable protein can allow an arbitrary destabilization of the native state with no consequences for longevity, provided that the TS is equally destabilized (Figure 8(a)). This is easily realizable because only a small number of interactions differ between the N and TS of these proteins (compared to N and U for thermodynamically stable proteins). Therefore, kinetically stable proteins may employ mechanisms for adaptation to a harsh environment that are not available to thermodynamically stable proteins. While kinetic stability is shown here to stabilize NAPase over broad pH conditions, this concept should be generalizable for development of resistance to other destabilizing agents, such as alkali, heat, or chemical denaturants (e.g., urea or guanidine).

Materials and Methods
Protein production NAPase was expressed and purified as described previously.37 Lyophilized NAPase was resuspended in 2 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and buffer was exchanged to remove residual salt. NAPase for use in crystallization experiments was treated with the serine protease inhibitor aminoethylbenzylsulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). AEBSF (100 molar excess) in 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, was added to concentrated NAPase and this solution was incubated at room temperature overnight. Near 100% inhibition of NAPase was obtained. NAPase­AEBSF was then concentrated in a BioMax 5-kDa molecular weight cutoff filter (Millipore) and buffer exchanged with 2 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, in the concentrator. LP was prepared as previously described.48 All chemicals were purchased from Sigma­Aldrich. The Relocation Mutant (Asn15BAsp, Glu32Ala, Arg141Ser) was created using the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers 5-GCTGCAGACCACGGCCGACATCGTCGGCGGCATCGCATACTCGATCAACA-3 and 5GGTGTGCCGCTCGGGCAGCACCACCGGTTACCAG3. Mutant expression and purification were performed as described previously.48 Unfolding NAPase unfolding was measured by either CD monitored at 213 nm or loss of unfolding activity. Although NAPase has two tryptophans, unfolding was not monitored by fluorescence due to low signal for unfolding under the conditions used. For CD experiments, concentrated protein was mixed with buffer preequilibrated to the proper temperature (final [protein]= 5 M) in a 0.2-cm path-length cuvette and the CD signal at 213 nm was monitored by a Jasco J-175 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD). For loss of activity experiments, concentrated protein was mixed with buffer pre-equilibrated to the proper temperature (1 M final protein). Aliquots were taken at various time-points and the unfolding reaction was quenched on ice. Protease activity was subsequently measured as previously described,36 except NAPase activity was monitored using 1 mM succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (Bachem, Bioscience, Inc.) as substrate. LP unfolding was monitored by both loss of protease activity and by fluorescence as previously described.35 Unfolding of the Relocation Mutant was similarly monitored by fluorescence with a Fluoromax-3 fluorometer (JY Horiba) (excitation 283 nm, emission 322 nm). The buffers (all at 10 mM) utilized were glycine (pH 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0), potassium acetate (pH 5.0), Tris (pH 8.0), Caps (pH 11.0), and arginine (pH 12.0). Unfolding rate constants were obtained by fitting data to a single exponential equation or with a single exponential plus a linear term.

880
Survival assay The survival assay at pH 7.0 was performed as described previously31 except that NAPase was used in place of SGPB and final protein concentrations were 5 M. The survival assay at pH 2.5 was performed in a similar manner except that the reaction was buffered with 50 mM glycine, pH 2.5, and pepsin A (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) was utilized in place of bovine trypsin because it is much more active at low pH than serine proteases such as trypsin, NAPase, and LP. Because pepsin is unfolded and inactive at the pH of the activity assay (pH 8.0),17­20 the proteolytic activities measured for both LP and NAPase are unaffected by the presence of pepsin. The inactivation rates for NAPase and LP at pH 7.0 were determined from a linear fit, whereas the inactivation rates for trypsin and LP (at pH 2.5) were determined with a single exponential fit. NAPase crystallization and structure determination Crystallization experiments were setup using the hanging-drop, vapor diffusion method in 24-well trays (Nextal Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada) at room temperature. Thin, rod-like crystals of NAPase­AEBSF (10 mg/ml) grew over a solution of 1.3 M ammonium sulfate, 10% (v/v) dioxane, 0.1 M Mes, pH 6.0, overnight. For data collection, crystals were frozen in mother liquor with 20% (v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data were collected at Advanced Light Source Beamline 8.2.2. Diffracting crystals were space group P3221 with two NAPase molecules per asymmetric unit. Data reduction was performed using HKL200072 and initial phases were obtained using molecular replacement and a poly-Ala search model from the closely related (57% identical) protein TFPA (B.A.K. and D.A.A., submitted). To minimize model bias, divergent loops were deleted from the search model. Electron density maps of the protein were high quality, as all backbone atoms and all but two sidechains could be unambiguously modeled (no interpretable density beyond C was found in Fo­Fc difference maps for both Arg241 or Arg220.) Contrary to the sequence information in the NCBI database, which lists residue 196 as alanine, from the density maps this residue is unambiguously glycine. Both 2Fo­Fc and Fo­ Fc maps show no density corresponding to a C atom and the residue adopts Phi/Psi angles that are only allowed for glycine. Moreover, this residue, which is directly adjacent to the catalytic serine, is also conserved as glycine in nearly all known serine proteases of the chymotrypsin fold. Refinement was accomplished using CNS73 and manual rebuilding using O.74 According to the validation program PROCHECK,75 the resulting model had acceptable or better than average geometry, with 86.7% of residues in the most favored Ramachandran region, 12.6% in the allowed region, and 0.7% in the unfavorable region. Electron density for the two residues in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Tyr120E from both molecules A and B) was extremely clear. Structural alignments, used for Supplemental Figure 1 and the sequence alignment in Figure 1, were performed using the Combinatorial Extension method.76 Figures 5 and 9 were produced with Pymol77 and Figure 6 with CCP4-MG.7,79 The NAPase structure  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

Structural and Mechanistic Basis of Acid Stability shown in Figure 6 includes two arginine side-chains that could not be accurately fit into the final model. For the purposes of Figure 6, these side-chains were placed into the most favorable rotamer. Since both Arg220 and Arg241 are on the periphery of the protein, the precise positioning of these residues has negligible effects on the electrostatics of the domain interface.
