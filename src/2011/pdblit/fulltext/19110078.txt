Abstract A thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) has been identified in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (Ss). This enzyme is a homodimeric flavoprotein that was previously identified as NADH oxidase in the same micro-organism (`Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 23 (1996) 47'). The primary structure of SsTrxR is made of 323 amino acid residues and contains two putative bab regions for the binding of FAD, and a NADP(H) binding consensus sequence in the proximity of a CXXC motif. These findings indicate that SsTrxR is structurally related to the class II of the pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases family. Moreover, the enzyme exhibits a NADP(H) dependent thioredoxin reductase activity requiring the presence of FAD. Surprisingly, the reductase activity of SsTrxR is reduced in the presence of a specific inhibitor of mammalian TrxR. This finding demonstrates that the archaeal enzyme, although structurally related to eubacterial TrxR, is functionally closer to eukaryal enzymes. Experimental evidences indicate that a disulphide bridge is required for the reductase but also for the NADH oxidase activity of the enzyme. These results are further supported by the significantly reduced activities exerted by the C147A mutant. The integrity of the CXXC motif is also involved in the stability of the enzyme. © 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is a flavoenzyme that catalyses the NADPH-dependent electron transfer to the active site disulphide of oxidised thioredoxin (Trx) to form a dithiol [1]. The reduced form of Trx in turn transfers its reducing equivalents to several cellular targets. This redox system is widely distributed in nature and participates to different cellular functions [2]. In particular, the activity of TrxR

has been involved in ribonucleotide metabolism [3], control of cellular redox state [4,5], regulation of transcriptional activity [6] and protein folding [7]. TrxR is organised as a homodimer [8], and on the basis of the monomer size, this enzyme can be classified into two structurally unrelated groups. Type I high molecular mass TrxR (55­58 kDa per subunit), isolated from higher eukaryotes [9­11] and type II low molecular mass TrxR (around 35 kDa per subunit) isolated from lower eukaryotes [12] and prokaryotes [13]. Both enzymes belong to the family of pyridine nucleotidedisulphide oxidoreductases that includes also lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase and mercuric reductase [14], but class I TrxR exhibits a broader substrate specificity, and an additional redox active motif at their C-terminal region [2]. In archaea, only recently TrxR has been isolated and characterised in Aeropyrum pernix K1 [15] and Pyrococcus horikoshii [16] belonging to the crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota branches of the archaeal domain, respectively [17]. Regarding the enzymes, that in Sulfolobales are in-

volved in the control of the intracellular redox balance, we have previously reported the isolation and characterisation of a NADH oxidase from the archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius [18]. The S. solfataricus enzyme was a homodimer composed of two 35 kDa subunits containing one molecule of FAD per subunit, whereas the S. acidocaldarius enzyme was a 27 kDa monomer which was purified with no flavin nucleotide bound. More recently, we have also reported the cloning and the characterisation of a 38 kDa NADH oxidase from S. solfataricus which was different from that previously identified [19], but with a high sequence homology to a putative eubacterial thioredoxin reductase [20]. However, this enzyme showed a homodimeric structure that did not contain the canonical consensus sequence CXXC typical of the enzymes belonging to the TrxR family. These findings prompted us to investigate whether the previously reported S. solfataricus 35 kDa NADH oxidase [18] could belong to the TrxR family. In this work, we show that this enzyme contains the CXXC motif in the active site and possesses thioredoxin reductase activity.

2.3. Cloning of the SsTrxR encoding gene A molecular probe for the isolation of the gene encoding SsTrxR was amplified by PCR, in a Perkin Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler, using the S. solfataricus genomic DNA as template, and two primers derived from the amino acid sequence of the enzyme. In particular, the forward primer GA(AG)AA(AG)TT(CT)GA(CT)GT(AT)AT(AT)AT (TrxR1) was deduced from the N-terminal amino acid sequence E14KFDVI of the purified protein [18], whereas the reverse primer AA(AT)CC(AT)AT(TC)TC(AT)AT(GA)AA(AT)AC (TrxR2) was designed from the N-terminal sequence V243FIEIG of the purified tryptic fragment of the enzyme described above. Degenerations on the third codon position were reduced on the basis of the preferential codon usage in S. solfataricus [22] and indicated in parentheses. A S. solfataricus DNA library was prepared into pUC19 cloning vector, using EcoR I and HindIII as cloning sites. About 2 × 103 colonies were analysed using the 32P labelled PCR fragment, as a probe and a recombinant clone containing a 4 kbp insert, including the entire SsTrxR gene, was isolated and partially sequenced. This plasmid was named pUCTrxR. 2.4. Construction of the expression vector

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Restriction enzymes, modifying enzymes and labelled compounds were from Amersham. Plasmid DNA, genomic DNA and labelled probes were prepared as described [21]. b-NADH, b-NADPH, FAD, ATP, 5,5-dithiobis-2nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), isopropyl-b-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), auranofin, azelaic acid, dithiothreitol (DTT), b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME), Escherichia coli thioredoxin (EcTrx), bovine trypsin treated with tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were obtained from Sigma. The following buffers were used. Buffer A: 25 mM Mes/KOH, pH 5.5; buffer B: 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl; buffer C: 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8; buffer D: 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 50% glycerol. 2.2. Purification and trypsin digestion of SsTrxR SsTrxR, formerly identified as 35 kDa NADH oxidase was purified from S. solfataricus cells as reported [18]. The tryptic digestion of the enzyme was performed in buffer B at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml trypsin. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight and the reaction was stopped by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor (25 µg/ml final concentration). The mixture was then analysed on a C18 column connected to an HPLC system equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid containing 5% acetonitrile. Peptides were eluted by a linear 5­55% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid. The most abundant peak, eluted at about 35% acetonitrile, was dried and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. The complete coding sequence of the SsTrxR gene was synthesised by PCR using as template pUCTrxR. The primers used were 5-GTATAGccaTGgGTCTTCTACCAA-3 (forward) and 5-TATCGTGaaGCtTCTATAGCAAC-3 (reverse), where the underlined letters indicate the initiation codon and lower case letters indicate the base substitutions inserted to create the Nco I and Hind III cloning sites. The amplified fragment was digested with Nco I and Hind III and inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-28 (Novagen), digested with the same enzymes. Restriction analysis and sequencing confirmed the correct sequence of the recombinant clone, which was designated as pSsTrxR. 2.5. Site-directed mutagenesis Cysteine 147 in SsTrxR was mutated to alanine (C147A) by site-directed mutagenesis [23]. The primers used were: 5-CTGCTCAGTCGCTGATGCACCTC-3 (forward), and 5-GAGGTGCATCAGCGACTGAGCAG-3 (reverse); the underlined triplet GCT coding for Ala147 replaced the wildtype triplet TGT coding for Cys147. Double-stranded pSsTrxR and primers were added to a reaction mixture containing deoxyribonucleotides, buffer, and PfuTurboTM DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The correct substitutions and the absence of other undesired mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. 2.6. SsTrxR expression and purification E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells were transformed with the pSsTrxR expression vector and grown in Luria­

Bertani medium at 37 °C overnight. The addition of 1 mM IPTG for induction led to the accumulation of a large amount of insoluble recombinant protein; therefore, the IPTG induction was omitted. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and re-suspended in 20 ml of buffer B supplemented with 1 mM PMSF. Cells were disrupted by a constant cell disruption system (Constant Systems Ltd., UK) and the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was incubated at 70 °C for 30 min to denaturate most of the E. coli proteins that were then removed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialysed against buffer A and then applied to a Mono S cation-exchange column equilibrated at room temperature with buffer A and connected to an FPLC apparatus (Amersham). Recombinant SsTrxR was eluted with a linear 0­200 mM KCl gradient in buffer A. Fractions, showing a single protein band on SDS/PAGE, were pooled, concentrated by Aquacide II, dialysed against buffer D and stored at ­20 °C. Under these conditions, the yield from 1 l culture was 5­10 mg of purified recombinant SsTrxR (rSsTrxR) or its C147A mutant. 2.7. Enzymatic assays All assays were carried out at 60 °C and were followed kinetically. NADH oxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the initial rate of NADH oxidation as reported [18]. Thioredoxin reductase activity was evaluated by both DTNB- and thioredoxin reduction methods [24,25]. In the DTNB reduction, the formation of the product 2-nitro-5thiobenzoate (TNB) was followed spectrophotometrically by the increase in absorbance at 412 nm. A different molar extinction coefficient than that usually employed in the DTNB-method of 7680 M­1 cm­1, was determined in buffer A and used to calculate the enzymatic activity. The reaction mixture contained 5 mM DTNB, 0.25 mM NADPH, 0.05 mM FAD, and 10 mM EDTA, in 1 ml final volume of buffer A. In the thioredoxin reduction assay, the reaction mixture contained 0.2 mM E. coli Trx (EcTrx), 0.05 mM FAD, 2 mM EDTA, and an appropriate amount of SsTrxR in 1 ml final volume of buffer A; the reaction was started by adding 0.1 mM NADPH. The activity was calculated from the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 M­1 cm­1. Blanks run in the absence of the enzyme were carried out in parallel and were subtracted. The inhibition of rSsTrxR activities was measured in the presence of the specific TrxR inhibitors auranofin or azelaic acid [25] as well as in the presence of reducing agents (DTT or b-ME). Stock solutions of auranofin (9 mM) and azelaic acid (7 mM) were prepared in DMSO and water, respectively. The inhibitory effect was evaluated on both DTNBand thioredoxin reduction methods. Each inhibitor was incubated with rSsTrxR for 1 min at 60 °C prior substrate addition.

2.8. Ellman assay The number of disulphide bonds was evaluated by the Ellman assay [26] on both the oxidised or reduced rSsTrxR. Reduced rSsTrxR was obtained by incubating 25 µM protein with 6 M guanidine·HCl, and 50 mM DTT for 20 min at 25 °C in 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 7.2. Following the reduction, the sample was dialysed against 6 M guanidine·HCl in 0.1 M acetic acid, in order to remove DTT excess. To titrate free cysteines, 1.25­5 µM of either oxidised or reduced rSsTrxR in 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 7.2 containing 6 M guanidine·HCl, was incubated with 0.2 M DTNB at 25 °C. Quantification of DTNB-modified cysteines was carried out monitoring the time-dependent increase in the absorbance at 412 nm (TNB molar extinction coefficient = 13,600 M­1 cm­1). 2.9. Stability of rSsTrxR The chemical stability of rSsTrxR or its C147A mutant was evaluated by fluorescence spectra using 295 nm as excitation wavelength, after exposure of the enzymes to 6 M guanidine·HCl in buffer C for 20 h at 25 °C. The protein concentration was 0.2 µM for both rSsTrxR and its C147A mutant. The thermal denaturation of rSsTrxR or its C147A mutant was followed by fluorescence melting curves in the temperature range 25­100 °C, using a computer assisted Cary Eclipse Spectrofluorimeter (Varian), equipped with an electronic temperature control. The increase in temperature was set at 0.2 °C/min; the fluorescence in the aromatic region was monitored at every degree centigrade increase, using 280 and 345 nm excitation and emission wavelength, respectively. The enzyme concentration was 1.42 µM for both rSsTrxR and its C147A mutant. The values of the fluorescence intensity were corrected for the temperature quenching, normalised between 0% and 100% and plotted vs. temperature [27]. In both fluorimetric methods, excitation and emission slits were set to 10 nm. 2.10. Other methods Purity of protein samples was assessed on 12% SDS/PAGE using appropriate Mr standards; protein concentration was determined using the protein assay system of Bio-Rad, using BSA as the standard. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on both DNA strands, by using the T7 sequencing kit (Promega) and synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. A Southern blot on S. solfataricus genomic DNA was performed as described [28]. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region and that of a tryptic fragment of the protein was determined by automated Edman degradation on a pulsed liquid sequencer (Applied Biosystems) connected on line to an HPLC apparatus for amino acid identification. The molecular mass of proteins in non-denaturing conditions was determined by a Superdex 75 gel-filtration column cali-

brated as reported [29]. Query for sequence similarities was addressed to the Swiss-Prot Database using the BLASTP program [30]. Sequence analyses and alignments were established using the CLUSTAL program [31]. A structurally based alignment was obtained from the Swiss-Model server [32] using the structural coordinates of TrxR from E. coli (Protein Data Bank code 1tde) and Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB code 1vdc) as templates.

3. Results 3.1. Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding SsTrxR The 710 bp DNA fragment amplified by PCR from the S. solfataricus genomic DNA using the primers TrxR1 and TrxR2 (see Section 2), was cloned in the pGEM-T easy vector and sequenced. The primary structure translated from

the nucleotide sequence of this fragment contained the N-terminal sequence of both intact and tryptic fragments of SsTrxR purified from S. solfataricus cells. Analysis of S. solfataricus DNA by Southern blot, using the 32P-labelled PCR fragment as a probe, indicated that a 4.2-kbp EcoR I/HindIII insert contained the entire gene. Colony hybridisation screening of the S. solfataricus DNA library into the pUC19 vector led to the isolation of a clone containing the entire gene coding for SsTrxR. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide sequence of this gene and its flanking regions together with the translated amino acid sequence. The SsTrxR gene coded for a protein composed of 323 amino acid residues accounting for a Mr 35,303, a value close to that determined by SDS/PAGE. The unusual start codon GTG is a feature common to other S. solfataricus genes [22]. The 5-flanking region of SsTrxR gene, included a putative archaeal promoter with a canonical TATA box but did not contain a ShineDalgarno sequence, a finding already reported for other

genes in S. solfataricus [33]. Moreover, in this region a partial open reading frame starting from nucleotide -210 on the complementary strand was found and was identified in the S. solfataricus genome [34] as the gene coding for a putative dihydropteroate synthase. The 3-flanking region of the gene contained a transcription termination signal and overlapped with another partial open reading frame, starting from nucleotide 969, coding for a putative inositol-1monophosphatase. The SsTrxR gene possesses a high content of A and T (34.3% and 27.6%, respectively) as compared to G and C (26.0% and 12.1%, respectively), a finding in agreement with the selective codon usage in S. solfataricus genes [22]. The amino acid composition of SsTrxR revealed the presence of three cysteine residues, two of them included in a C144XXC sequence, typical motif present in enzymes belonging to pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase family [35]. In addition, in the primary structure the consensus for both FAD [36] and NAD(P) [37] binding have been identified. The average hydrophobicity of the amino acid residue [38] in the SsTrxR (4.95 kJ/aa residue) was slightly lower than that calculated for other S. solfataricus proteins (5.15 kJ/aa residue), still remaining higher than that of other mesophilic archaeal, eukaryal and eubacterial proteins [22]. 3.2. Amino acid sequence comparison SsTrxR shows sequence homology with eubacterial, archaeal and lower eukaryal thioredoxin reductases (not

shown). The best alignment was obtained with two putative TrxR identified in the genome of Sulfolobus tokodaii (AC Q974W4, 76% amino acid identities, 12% conservative substitutions; and AC Q975H4, 39% and 10%, respectively) [39]. In addition, SsTrxR was identical to a putative TrxR present in the S. solfataricus genome (AC Q97W27) and similar (35% and 11%, respectively) with another putative thioredoxin reductase (AC Q97W69) also present in the same genome [34]. A structurally based multiple alignment between the amino acid sequence of SsTrxR and that of E. coli and A. thaliana TrxR (EcTrxR and AtTrxR, respectively), whose three-dimensional structure has been determined [40,41] is reported in Fig. 2. Although the overall homology is quite low (25% amino acid identities and 24% conservative substitutions) the highest homology was found in the regions of EcTrxR and AtTrxR involved in the interaction with substrate and cofactor. 3.3. Molecular and functional properties of rSsTrxR and its C147A mutant Purified rSsTrxR and its C147A mutant appeared homogeneous on SDS/PAGE and showed an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the enzyme isolated from S. solfataricus cells, accounting for a size of about 35 kDa. The molecular mass of the enzyme determined under nondenaturing conditions by gel-filtration was about 70 kDa.

Fig. 3. Fluorescence spectra in the flavin emission region of rSsTrxR and its C147A mutant. Fluorescence spectra were recorded for rSsTrxR (upper line) and its C147A mutant (lower line) at 25 °C at a protein concentration of 0.63 µM in buffer C. Excitation wavelength was 450 nm; emission and excitation slits were set to 5 nm. Blanks were subtracted.

Fig. 4. Reduction of DTNB and EcTrx catalysed by rSsTrxR. The reaction was carried out as described in Section 2 using the DTNB method (A­D) or the thioredoxin method (E­F) in the presence of 20 µg/ml of rSsTrxR and: (A) NADPH alone (250 µM); (B) NADPH and FAD (50 µM); (C) NADH alone (200 µM); (D) NADH and FAD; (E) NADPH (100 µM) and FAD; (F) NADPH, FAD and E. coli Trx (200 µM).

These results confirmed the homodimeric structure rSsTrxR, as already reported for the wild-type enzyme [18]. In addition, the C147A substitution did not affect the quaternary structure of the enzyme. rSsTrxR and its C147A mutant were purified as flavoproteins, as already found for SsTrxR [18]. In fact, in the absorption spectrum of both enzymes, besides the maximum at 272 nm due to aromatic residues, the typical flavoprotein absorption bands centred at 375 and 450 nm, were found (not shown). This behaviour was also confirmed by emission fluorescence spectra (Fig. 3) that also allowed the determination of the number of flavin molecule bound per rSsTrxR subunit. In particular, a stoichiometry of 0.7 mol of FAD per mol of subunit of rSsTrxR was determined from the emission band at 520 nm. Concerning the C147A mutant, a lower content of 0.3 mol of FAD per mol of subunit was found. We have then determined the disulphide bond content of rSsTrxR using the Ellman method on either the oxidised or the reduced form of the enzyme. The results clearly indicate that two cysteine residues were involved in a disulphide bridge. In addition, SDS/PAGE under non-reducing conditions, showed that the disulphide bridge occurred between residues belonging to the same subunit. It has to be noted that the fluorescence spectrum of the reduced form of rSsTrxR did not indicate the presence of bound FAD (not shown).
Table 1 Kinetic parameters of rSsTrxRa NADPH EcTrx V (U/mg) 0.5 1.1 kcat (min­1) 36.7 77.0

Concerning the catalytic properties, rSsTrxR showed a NADH oxidase activity as the enzyme isolated from S. solfataricus [18], but with a slightly lower specific activity (6.4 instead of 8.7 U/mg, respectively). Regarding the C147A mutant, a much more reduced NADH oxidase activity was found (0.9 U/mg). We have then determined the thioredoxin reductase activity of rSsTrxR by both DTNB- and thioredoxin reduction methods in the absence or in the presence of different cofactors. As reported in Fig. 4, the highest activity was observed using EcTrx as substrate and both NADPH and FAD as cofactors. The same behaviour was observed in the case of DTNB reduction, even though the specific activity was lower. Regarding the specificity for the nicotinamide dinucleotide substrate, the enzyme cannot use NADH as electron donor for the reduction of either DTNB or EcTrx. In addition, the C147A mutant, possessed a hardly detectable reduction activity (<0.02 U/mg), with both methods (not shown). These results clearly indicate that the enzyme previously identified in S. solfataricus as a 35 kDa NADH oxidase [18] has to be re-classified as a thioredoxin reductase. The kinetic parameters of rSsTrxR activity were reported in Table 1. In particular, the affinity for NADPH was measured by the DTNB method, whereas the affinity for Trx was determined by the reduction of heterologous EcTrx. In the DTNB-reduction method a higher catalytic efficiency was observed with respect to that measured in the EcTrx reduc-

a The initial velocity of DTNB reduction was measured at saturating DTNB concentration (5 mM) in the presence of different NADPH concentration (1­300 µM). In the case of the EcTrx reduction, saturating concentration of NADPH (200 µM) and different concentration of EcTrx (20­200 µM) were used. The enzyme concentration was 0.29 µM. V and Km were derived from Lineweaver­Burk plots. kcat was calculated considering a Mr for SsTrxR of 70,606.

tion method. This finding can be ascribed to a 26-fold reduced affinity towards the substrate, in spite of the 2.1-fold increase of the catalytic constant. 3.4. Inhibition of rSsTrxR activities Inhibition of rSsTrxR was evaluated using two different specific TrxR inhibitors: auranofin and azelaic acid [25]. As reported in Fig. 5A, auranofin inhibited rSsTrxR activity as determined with both the DTNB and EcTrx reduction methods, with IC50 values of 13 and 54 µM (Fig. 5B), respectively. Regarding azelaic acid, almost no inhibition was detectable with the DTNB method. In addition, no inhibition of the NADH oxidase activity of rSsTrxR was found with both inhibitors (not shown). The effect of reducing agents on the NADH oxidase activity of rSsTrxR was also evaluated (Fig. 6). Both DTT and b-ME inhibited this activity and the IC50 values were 18.8 and 19.5 mM for DTT and b-ME, respectively (Fig. 6, inset). 3.5. Stability of rSsTrxR The denaturation of rSsTrxR and its C147A mutant was followed by fluorescence measurements. Fig. 7 showed the effect of the treatment with 6 M guanidine·HCl on the fluorescence spectrum of both enzymes in the region of the aromatic residues. The denaturation process provoked a decrease in the fluorescence intensity at 345 nm, but not a shift in wavelength of the maximum. However, the decrease was much more pronounced in the case of rSsTrxR with respect to that of its C147A mutant. The fluorescence decrease in the aromatic region was also used to evaluate the thermal denaturation of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 8, the half denaturation temperature of rSsTrxR

Excitation wavelength was 295 nm. Blanks were subtracted.

is 84 °C, whereas for the C147A mutant, under identical experimental conditions, the corresponding value significantly decreased to 63 °C. 4. Discussion The gene encoding a homodimeric 35 kDa/subunit thioredoxin reductase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsTrxR) was cloned and sequenced. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli, purified and characterised for its molecular and biochemical properties. This enzyme was previously identified as a NADH oxidase [18], but in this

report we show that it possesses a TrxR activity. From the analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 1), a number of features typical of enzymes belonging to the TrxR-like proteins were found. In fact, SsTrxR possesses putative ADP-binding bab fold regions typical of dinucleotide binding enzymes [36]. One of this region in SsTrxR corresponds to the segment D17-E46 containing the sequence G22LGPAA and a core of six hydrophobic residues V18, I20, A31, A35, L42, I44. Another putative bab fold region of SsTrxR corresponded to the segment R155-D187 that contained V157, V159, G161GGDSA, A170, L173, V180, I183. This region also contained the consensus sequence typical of the NAD(P) binding proteins GXGXXAXXXAXXXXXXG [37] that in SsTrxR corresponded to the segment G161GGDSALEGA. An additional consensus sequence conserved among many FAD-binding proteins is TXXXXhyhhGD, where h represents a small hydrophobic amino acid and y is an aromatic residue [42]. This sequence was identified in SsTrxR as T277SVPGVFAAGD. SsTrxR contained also the canonical redox active site CXXC common in all enzymes showing thioredoxin reductase activity [43]. In particular, this CXXC motif is contained in a class II pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases active site CX(2)CD(G/A)X(2/4)(F/Y)X(4)(L/I/V/M)X(L/I/V/M)(2) G(3)(D/N), as reported in the Swiss-Prot Prosite Database at the accession number PS00573 [35]. This motif corresponded in SsTrxR to the segment C144SVCDAPLFKNRVVAVIGGGD that in the primary structure overlapped to the NAD(H)P binding region reported above. The proximity of these two binding regions is a feature present in bacterial TrxR, whereas in mammalian TrxR, in lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione and trypanothione reductases, they were spatially separated [44]. SsTrxR was purified as a homodimeric flavoenzyme, and its molecular mass of 35 kDa/subunit was similar to that of

eubacterial and lower eukaryal TrxR [43]. The primary structure of SsTrxR showed significant sequence homology with thioredoxin reductases from archaea, eubacteria and low eukaryotes. The highest amino acid sequence identity was found with the deduced amino acid sequence of a putative TrxR present in the genome [39] of S. tokadai (Fig. 2). However, in the S. solfataricus genome [34] another gene encoding a putative TrxR is present, but it did not contain the canonical class II pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases consensus sequence reported above. This aspect is not unique for the S. solfataricus genome because more than one gene coding for putative TrxR were found also in the phylogenetically close related S. tokodaii as well as in other archaeal genomes such as Pyrobaculum aerophilum [45] and Ferroplasma acidarmanus [46]. This behaviour indicated that the classification of putative TrxR not harbouring a complete class II motif deserves further analysis. The multiple alignment between 17 archaeal TrxR sequences, all containing the class II consensus motif, showed that sequence identities were mainly found in the regions containing the binding sites for FAD and NAD(P)H (not shown). It is interesting to note that among all the archaeal TrxR analysed, the first X residue in the consensus sequence CXXC is occupied by A or S, whereas the second position is less conserved. Therefore, the first semi-invariant position might represent an additional distinctive property of archaeal TrxR. It is worth mentioning that the two variant residues in the CXXC motif have been correlated to the reduction potential of thiol:disulphide oxidoreductase family [47]. SsTrxR isolated from S. solfataricus binds 1 mol of FAD per subunit [18]. The lower content of FAD found in recombinant SsTrxR might be ascribed to a loss of cofactor during the purification procedure. In the C147A mutant the FAD content further decreased, a finding similar to that observed in EcTrxR mutated in cysteine residues present in the active site of the enzyme [48]. The presence of two cysteines involved in a disulphide bridge, prompted us to measure a thioredoxin reductase activity on rSsTrxR. The thioredoxin reductase activity of rSsTrxR was measured using both the DTNB and thioredoxin reduction assays (Fig. 4). The latter assay was carried out using heterologous EcTrx as substrate, as the S. solfataricus Trx, although putatively identified in the S. solfataricus genome [34], was not available yet. The reductase activity is strictly dependent on the presence of NADPH as electron donor and FAD as cofactor, a property demonstrating that the enzyme of S. solfataricus previously isolated as a NADH oxidase, belongs to the thioredoxin reductase family. This observation was also confirmed by the lack of reduction activity of the C147A mutant enzyme. Concerning the kinetic parameters, the high value of Km for EcTrx reported in Table 1 (44 µM) might depend on the use of the heterologous substrate used in the assay. This behaviour was also confirmed by the observation that wheat TrxR showed a higher Km for EcTrx (36 µM) with respect to that measured in the presence of homologous Trx (7.6 µM) [49]. Regarding the electron donor, the affinity for NADPH of

rSsTrxR was similar to that found for other eukaryal [49,50], eubacterial [48] and archaeal [15] TrxR. Inhibition of SsTrxR activities was studied either in the presence of specific TrxR inhibitors or reducing agents. Concerning the specific TrxR inhibitors, surprisingly SsTrxR activity was inhibited by auranofin, a specific inhibitor of human [25] and mitochondrial [51] TrxR. Vice versa, azelaic acid, a typical inhibitor of eubacterial TrxR [25], was almost unable to affect the activity of SsTrxR. These findings support the hypothesis that archaeal enzymes, more structurally related to eubacterial ones, are functionally closer to eukaryal enzymes [52]. In addition, these results further support the hypothesis that the Sulfolobus genus is the putative ancestor of animal mitochondria [53]. It is interesting to note that the NADH oxidase activity of rSsTrxR was inhibited by reducing agents (Fig. 6). This finding, and the very low NADH oxidase activity of the C147A, suggests that the disulphide bridge in SsTrxR is also involved in the NADH oxidation catalysed by the enzyme. Regarding the stability of rSsTrxR, the finding that the C147A mutant displays a reduced thermal stability, together with the reduced sensibility to chemical denaturation, indicates that the disulphide bridge in the active site of the enzyme, besides its involvement in the catalytic property of SsTrxR, is also important for the stability of the enzyme.

5. Conclusion The data reported in this paper shed light on the real function of the thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme that has been previously identified as NADH oxidase in Sulfolobus solfataricus [18]. The finding that a NADH oxidase can elicit also another enzymatic activity has already been reported for several eubacterial species [54]. Therefore, because this enzyme belongs to a system playing an important role in several cellular functions, such as redox control [4,5], activity of transcription factors [6], DNA synthesis [3], protein folding [7], and apoptosis [55], it will be of great help to better characterise this redox system in S. solfataricus, also by trying to solve its 3-D structure.
