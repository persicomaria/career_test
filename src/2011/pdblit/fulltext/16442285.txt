Abstract--A series of novel benzoxazole benzenesulfonamides was synthesized as inhibitors of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-1). Extensive SAR studies led to a potent inhibitor, 53, with an IC50 of 0.57 lM. Compound 17 exhibited excellent bioavailability and a good pharmacokinetic profile in rats. Ó 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the previous paper,1 we identified benzoxazole benzenesulfonamide 1 as a novel inhibitor of human fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (hFBPase-1) with an IC50 of 3.4 lM in a colorimetric malachite green assay. X-ray crystallographic studies indicate that 1 has a unique binding mode, partially occupying the AMP allosteric regulatory site. In this communication, we will report the synthesis and structure­activity profile of benzoxazole benzenesulfonamide analogs 2, leading to an improvement in potency.

A rapid systematic variation of substituents on the phenyl ring was accomplished in a parallel synthesis fashion through the key intermediate 5. Compound 6 was prepared by Suzuki coupling reaction;3 7, 8, and 9 were prepared via corresponding copper assisted nucleophilic substitution reactions4 (Scheme 2). The introduction of substituents to the benzene ring was performed as Scheme 3. Treating 10 with either cyanogen bromide5 or di(imidazole-1-yl)methanimine6 afforded substituted benzoxazol-2-ylamine 11, which, in turn, reacted with 2,5-dichlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride to form intermediate 12. Coupling 12 with aryl boronic acid via Suzuki reaction gave rise to the desired compound 13. The inhibitory activity of synthesized molecules was evaluated by a colorimetric malachite green hFBPase1 assay as described in our previous article.1 The effects of replacement of the benzenesulfonamide on FBPase-1 inhibitory activity are summarized in Table 1. The aromatic character of this group appears to be crucial.

Benzoxazole benzenesulfonamide analogs 2 were prepared by treating substituted benzoxazol-2-ylamines 3 with sulfonyl chlorides 4 in the presence of pyridine as shown in Scheme 1.2 Both 3 and 4 were either commercially available or prepared according to the literature procedures.

Heteroaromatic (15, 16) and fused aromatic rings (17, 18) are well tolerated. Replacement of the phenyl ring with alkyl groups (19, 20) dramatically diminishes the activity. Further SAR studies focused on the effects of substituents of the phenyl ring (Table 2). Several substituents provide some improvement in potency, for instance, 3Cl (25, IC50 = 1.3 lM) and 3-NO2 (26, IC50 = 1.8 lM), represent a 2­3-fold boost in potency relative to initial lead 1. In general, mono-substitution at the ortho-, metaor para-position is desirable, but bulky groups such as tBu (32, IC50 = 24 lM) and 4-t-Bu-benzyloxy (28, IC50 > 50 lM) lead to reduced activity; ortho-, orthodi-substitution (36, 37) is strongly disfavored. Manipulation of substituents on the benzoxazole ring also led to a series of new compounds (Table 3). The 4-position is the most restrictive site on the molecule; even small substituents such as iodo and methyl lead to a substantial loss of potency. This result is consistent with the previously reported crystallographic binding mode,1 which indicates that 4-substituents are directed toward the interior of the FBPase tetramer. In contrast, the 7-position is directed toward the outside of the FPBase tetramer, allowing for a broader range of

substituents, preferably hydrophilic. Small substituents are tolerated at the 5-position and are acceptable at the 6-position. A combination of 5-MeO and various 7-substituents significantly boosts the potency. Of note is 53, in which a combination of 5-MeO with 7-(3-aminophenyl) gives a 6-fold boost in potency (IC50 = 0.57 lM) versus 1. Compound 53 also shows im-

regulatory site and the benzoxazole moiety protrudes into the space between subunits of the FBPase homotetramer. In addition to the AMP-site interactions, the amino group of the C7-substituent is exposed and makes two additional hydrogen-bonding interactions with the C@O of Gly26 and Thr27. Other analogs with 7-substituents capable of H-bonding (e.g., 48, 49) interact similarly with the protein backbone (data not shown) and demonstrate improved potency, suggesting that the latter may be the result of these H-bonding interactions. Compound 17 was selected as a representative to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of these benzoxazole benzenesulfonamides in rats. At 5 mg/kg dose, compound 17 was shown to have an excellent oral bioavailability (>100%) with a long oral half-life (7.5 h) and a low plasma clearance (0.04 L/h kg) (Fig. 2). In conclusion, we have synthesized a series of novel benzoxazole benzenesulfonamides as inhibitors of FBPase-1. Optimization of screening hit 1 led to compound 53 (IC50 = 0.57 lM) with a 6-fold boost in potency. X-ray crystal structures revealed that the appropriately selected 7-substituent of 53 forms two additional hydrogen bonding interactions with the enzyme, leading to the enhanced affinity. These results suggest opportunities to design even more potent FBPase-1 inhibitors. Compound 17 with an IC50 of 2.5 lM exhibited an excellent pharmacokinetic profile in rats. Further optimization studies as well as the pharmacological characterization of leading compounds will be reported in due course. References and notes

Figure 1. Binding mode of 53 in the FBPase tetramer. The view is approximately along one of the tetramer dyads and illustrates the binding mode of 53 in the periphery of the FBPase tetramer. Each molecule of inhibitor interacts with the main chain C@O of residues Gly26 and Thr27 across the dyad. Thick dotted lines (left) highlight the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the anilino group of molecule A of 53 with the main chain carbonyl oxygens of a second molecule of FBPase trans- across the twofold symmetry axis (white symbols and gray atoms). Thin dotted lines indicate the corresponding interaction for molecule B of 53 with the opposite monomer of FBPase (yellow symbols and stick bonds). There are four molecules of 53 per tetramer; ° H-bond distances range from 2.7 to 3.6 A. Aromatic stacking of the aniline groups across the symmetry axis is apparent.

The X-ray crystal structure of 537 confirms the previously observed binding mode for this series of inhibitors and is consistent with the SAR concepts outlined (Fig. 1). Similar to compound 1,1 the arylsulfonamide portion of 53 interacts with a part of the AMP allosteric

Co-crystals of human FBPase-1 with 48 (and 53) were grown by protocols similar to the ones used in Ref. 1 but displacing the seeding compound ZMP with the relevant ligand. The crystals with 48 were orthorhombic (P212121) ° with cell constants a = 67.4, b = 83.3, c = 277.5 A and ° diffracted to 2.8 A resolution, using synchrotron radiation (Advanced Photon Source, APS, IMCA-CAT, 17-ID). The crystals contained one tetramer of FBPase and four molecules of 48 in the asymmetric unit. The crystals with

53 were orthorhombic (P212121) with cell constants ° a = 84.4, b = 108.7, c = 196.4 A and diffracted weakly only ° to approximately 3.5 A, using synchrotron radiation (Advanced Photon Source, APS, IMCA-CAT, 17-ID). The crystals contained one tetramer of FBPase and four molecules of 53 in the asymmetric unit. The structures of FBPase with 48 and 53 were solved by molecular replacement using one FBPase tetramer and refined using standard methods. Crystallographic coordinates of FBPase complexed with 48 and 53 have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 2fie, 2fix.
