Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore MD 21250, USA The solution structure of the capsid protein (CA) from the human T-cell leukemia virus type one (HTLV-I), a retrovirus that causes T-cell leukemia and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy in humans, has been determined by NMR methods. The protein consists of independent N and C-terminal domains connected by a ¯exible linker. The domains are structurally similar to the N-terminal ``core'' and C-terminal ``dimerization'' domains, respectively, of the human immunode®ciency virus type one (HIV-1) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) capsid proteins, although several important differences exist. In particular, hydrophobic residues near the major homology region are partially buried in HTLV-I CA, which is monomeric in solution, whereas analogous residues in HIV-1 and EIAV CA project from the C-terminal domain and promote dimerization. These differences in the structure and oligomerization state of the proteins appear to be related to, and possibly controlled by, the oxidation state of conserved cysteine residues, which are reduced in HTLV-I CA but form a disul®de bond in the HIV-1 and EIAV CA crystal structures. The results are consistent with an oxidative capsid assembly mechanism, in which CA oligomerization or maturation is triggered by disul®de bond formation as the budding virus enters the oxidizing environment of the bloodstream.

Introduction
Human T-cell leukemia virus type one (HTLV-I) is an oncogenic retrovirus that exhibits speci®c tropism for human T-cells (Green & Chen, 1994; Hollsberg & Ha¯er, 1993). Approximately 1-4 % of HTLV-I infected individuals develop adult T-cell leukemia (Hollsberg & Ha¯er, 1993) or HTLV-I associated myelopathy, a slowly progressive neurologic disorder (Hjelle, 1992; Osame et al., 1987). HTLV-I was ®rst detected in humans in the mid-1970s (Uchiyama et al., 1977; Yodoi et al., 1974; Yoshida et al., 1982), and since then considerable efforts have focused on the pathology (Hollsberg & Ha¯er, 1993), epidemiology (Khabbaz et al., 1993; Mueller, 1991; Williams et al., 1988), virology (Green & Chen, 1990; Yoshida et al., 1982) and immunology (Stewart et al., 1994) of this virus and its role in human disease (for reviews, see Ferreira et al., 1997; Green & Chen, 1994). HTLV-I belongs to the HTLV/BLV genus of retroviruses, one of six genera that include the B, C and D-type retro# 1999 Academic Press

492 viruses, the lentiviruses, and the spumaviruses (Vogt, 1997b). Although substantial insights have been made into the structural biology of the lentiviruses over the past ten years, especially the human immunode®ciency virus (HIV) (Frankel & Young, 1998; Turner & Summers, 1999), the structural biology of HTLV-I has yet to be explored. Like all retroviruses, HTLV-I is an enveloped virus that packages two copies of its RNA genome within a centralized capsid core particle. The capsid core is composed of approximately 2000 copies of a $25 kDa capsid protein (CA). Capsid proteins are initially synthesized as part of a $50 kDa Gag precursor polyprotein in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. After their ribosomal synthesis, the Gag polyproteins recognize and capture the viral RNA, self-associate at the outer cell membrane and assemble into enveloped, immature viral particles that bud from the infected cell. Subsequent to budding, the Gag polyproteins are cleaved by the retroviral protease (PR), affording the independent matrix (MA), capsid and nucleocapsid (NC) proteins (for a review, see Vogt, 1997b). It is during this maturation process that the liberated capsid proteins assemble and form the capsid core. Interestingly, retroviruses of different genera exhibit morphologically distinct macroscopic core structures. For example, the capsid core particles of the HTLV/BLV genus are spherical, whereas those of the lentiviruses (including HIV and EIAV) are conical (Vogt, 1997b). Limited proteolysis experiments monitored by NMR have shown that HIV-1 CA contains a proteolytically resistant 145-residue N-terminal ``core'' domain (NTD) (Gitti et al., 1996). Subsequently, it was shown that the remaining C-terminal 85 residues (CTD) form an independently folded ``dimerization'' domain (Gamble et al., 1997). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments indicate that the HIV-1 CA CTD forms dimers with a dissociation constant (Kd  10 mM) (Gamble et al., 1997) that is essentially identical with that of the intact protein Â (Kd  18 mM) (Brooks et al., 1994; Rose et al., 1992; Yoo et al., 1997). Mutations and deletions within the CTD, which contains a highly conserved 20residue sequence known as the major homology region (MHR), generally impair or abolish viral assembly, whereas mutations in the NTD give rise to viruses that can assemble and bud but are not infectious (Chazal et al., 1994; Dorfman et al., 1994; È Franke et al., 1994a; Gottlinger et al., 1989; Hong & Boulanger, 1993; Jowett et al., 1992; Reicin et al., 1995; Spearman et al., 1994; Von Poblotzki et al., 1993; Wang & Barklis, 1993). In addition, HIV-1 particles package approximately 200 copies of the human protein cyclophilin A (CypA), which is essential for HIV-1 infectivity (Braaten et al., 1996; Franke et al., 1994b; Luban et al., 1993, 1994; Thali et al., 1994). CypA binds to an Ala-Gly-Pro-Ile sequence that is conserved among all strains of HIV-1. Interestingly, HIV-2 and other lentiviruses do not contain this conserved sequence and do not require CypA for infectivity. Although the precise

Structure of HTLV-I Capsid Protein

function of CypA is unknown, it may play a role in capsid disassembly (Gamble et al., 1996; Gitti et al., 1996; Luban, 1996). It is not known if retroviruses of the other genera require CypA for infectivity, and in this regard, the presence of an AlaGly-Pro-Leu sequence in the HTLV-I CA protein suggests that CypA binding might also be important for HTLV-I infectivity. To date, high-resolution structural data have only been obtained for capsid proteins from the lentivirus genus. The structure of the isolated NTD of HIV-1 CA (residues 1-151) was determined by NMR methods (Gitti et al., 1996), and the structures of the NTD complexed with CypA (Gamble et al., 1996), and bound to an antibody fragment (Momany et al., 1996) were determined by X-ray crystallography. More recently, X-ray structures have been determined for the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) capsid protein (Jin et al., 1999), as well as for the intact HIV-1 capsid protein bound to an antibody Fab fragment (BerthetColominas et al., 1999). These studies reveal that the NTD of HIV-1 and EIAV CA has a triangular and ¯at overall shape and is comprised mainly of a-helices. The NTD of HIV-1 CA also contains an N-terminal b-hairpin and an exposed, partially ordered loop that contains the CypA binding residues. In addition, the published structures indicate that the CTDs of the HIV-1 and EIAV capsid proteins adopt similar tertiary structures, consisting of an amino-terminal 310-helix, a short parallel bstrand and four a-helices (Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999; Gamble et al., 1997; Jin et al., 1999; Worthylake et al., 1999). Little is currently known about the mechanism of capsid assembly, or of the disassembly process that occurs during the infectivity stage of the retrovirus replication cycle. Such information could be useful for the development of antiviral agents designed to interfere with these processes. Similar strategies have been successfully applied to the development of compounds that bind to the capsids of human coxsackie and rhinoviruses and prevent their disassembly (Rossmann, 1994). However, attempts to obtain high-resolution structural information for the assembled core particles of retroviruses have been hampered by the fact that intact, native core particles are dif®cult to isolate (Vogt, 1997b), and methods for preparing core-like particles in vitro using recombinant capsid proteins have only recently been developed (Campbell & Vogt, 1997; Ganser et al., 1999). Thus, current understanding of the intermolecular interactions that may facilitate capsid assembly are based mainly on cryo-electron microscopy of virus-like particles formed by Gag mutants (Barklis et al., 1997, 1998; Campbell & Vogt, 1997; Hockley et al., 1994; Nermut et al., 1993; Nermut & Thomas, 1994) and on the HIV-1 and EIAV X-ray structures. Consistent with the analytical ultracentrifugation and mutagenesis data, the structural studies of the isolated HIV-1 CTD and EIAV CA revealed that the CTD crystallizes as a symmetric homodimer.

Although the relative orientation of the monomers in the CTD-CTD dimers of HIV-1 and EIAV X-ray structures are slightly different, the dimer interface is similar, and is comprised mainly of conserved hydrophobic side-chains that project from the 310helix and the second a-helix. In contrast, in the Xray structure of the intact HIV-1 CA bound to a monoclonal antibody Fab fragment, the Fab is bound to the CTD and the capsid molecules in the dimer exhibit an unexpected ``head-to-tail'' dimer interface (i.e. the dimer interface involves interactions between the NTD of one monomer and the CTD of the adjacent monomer) (Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999). It is not clear if this dimer interface is promoted by Fab binding, or if it indeed represents a physiologically relevant structure that forms, perhaps transiently, during capsid assembly. An additional puzzle concerns the role of two highly conserved CTD cysteine residues. Except for spumavirus and C-type retroviruses, all retroviral capsid CTDs contain two conserved cysteine residues located near the N and C termini of the two C-terminal a-helices. Although these cysteine residues appear to be reduced in freshly prepared virions isolated from culture (McDermott et al., 1996), they form a disul®de bond in the crystal structures of the HIV-1 and EIAV CA CTDs (Gamble et al., 1997; Jin et al., 1999; Worthylake et al., 1999). Mutagenesis experiments indicate the cysteine residues are essential for HIV-1 infectivity (McDermott et al., 1996), and it has been speculated that their oxidation to the disul®de may be physiologically relevant (Worthylake et al., 1999). In view of the relatively limited and yet diverse structural data available for intact retroviral capsid proteins, the lack of structural information for nonlentiviral capsids, and in order to address questions regarding the in¯uence of experimental conditions on intermolecular interactions and the potential role of the conserved cysteine residues, we have undertaken a structural study of the capsid protein from HTLV-I. This represents the ®rst protein from HTLV-I to be structurally characterized. A structure-based sequence comparison, guided by the HTLV-I and HIV-1 CA structures, has enabled us to de®ne general architectural features likely to be shared by the capsid proteins of different retroviral genera, as well as divergent regions that may account for the unique interactions and core particle morphologies among retroviral capsid proteins. We have also tested the ability of HTLV-I CA to bind CypA. Our studies suggest that oxidation state-dependent conformational changes in retroviral CA CTDs may promote CA oligomerization and/or core particle maturation in a manner similar to those observed in Papovaviradae family of viruses (Christiansen et al., 1977; Harrison et al., 1996; Sapp et al., 1998; Walter & Deppert, 1974).

Results and Discussion
Preparation of recombinant HTLV-I CA A system for the ef®cient expression and puri®cation of recombinant HTLV-I CA has been developed as follows. DNA constructs corresponding to the full-length and an N-terminal deletion mutant (lacking a 15 residue proline-rich segment; ®ve out of 15 residues are proline residues) of HTLV-I capsid were PCR-ampli®ed and subcloned into the phage T7 RNA polymerase-based expression vectors pET11a and pET16b (Studier et al., 1990). These vectors are similar, but pET16b encodes an N-terminal (His)10 leader sequence (His-tag). Although we had optimized the ®rst six codons in the coding sequence for translation in Escherichia coli, we detected no over-expression of the polypeptides in the absence of an N-terminal His-tag. Even with the His-tag, the full-length construct expressed poorly, and the protein degraded rapidly during expression and puri®cation. In contrast, the His-tagged N-terminal deletion mutant expressed at high levels and could be readily puri®ed under native conditions as illustrated in Figure 1. After the ®rst step of puri®cation by Ni2 af®nity chromatography, >90 % purity was achieved. A subsequent puri®cation step using a strong cation exchange medium allows puri®cation to homogeneity, with the ®nal yield of $25 mg lÀ1 (when E. coli growth was carried out in minimal medium). Removal of the His-tag was omitted because treatment with Factor Xa resulted in a signi®cant reduction in yield. Electrospray mass spectrometry under native and denaturing conditions afforded the mass expected after the ef®cient processing of the ®rst methionine. The mass obtained (Mr,obs  24,850(Æ4) g molÀ1; Mr,calc  24,852.5 g molÀ1) corresponds to a construct comprising the native residues 16 to 214, and including a non-

The extinction coef®cient of HTLV-I CA is e280 nm  24.5(Æ0.2) mMÀ1 cmÀ1. HTLV-I CA is monomeric in solution Preliminary investigations indicated that HTLV-I CA is soluble at millimolar concentration range in the presence of NaCl, and as such all measurements were carried out in the presence of 300 mM NaCl at pH 6.0. Size-exclusion chromatography experiments yielded an estimated mass ($34 kDa) that was 40 % larger than the monomeric molecular mass. Dynamic light scattering measurements indicated that the oligomerization properties of the protein do not change over the range of concentration from 40 to 400 mM, and that the sample remains mono-disperse over this range. A hydrodynamic radius of 3.1 nm, derived from the measured diffusion coef®cient and using the Stokes-Einstein equation, can be used to determine molecular mass in a shape-dependent manner. The estimated molecular mass obtained under the assumption of a spherical shape is nearly 90 % larger than the mass measured by mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation (see below), indicating that the protein is either dimeric in solution, or that it is a monomer with a highly anisotropic shape. Analytical ultracentrifugation measurements were conducted using protein concentrations in the range 6-24 mM. The results showed identical and constant correlation between boundary fraction and sedimentation coef®cient (s20 C  2.3 seconds) at all concentrations, indicating the lack of evidence for self-association. Subsequently, equilibrium sedimentation distributions at different speeds were measured for the protein, and a particle mass corresponding to a monomer of 24.5(Æ1.5) kDa was obtained, which is in close agreement with the actual mass (24.7 kDa). In addition, 1H NMR linewidths are insensitive to concentration over the range 0.4-1.2 mM. Thus, the combined results indicate that the protein has a highly anisotropic shape and is monomeric at concentrations up to at least 1 mM. This is in stark contrast to the HIV-1 CA and the isolated HIV-1 CA CTD, both of which present a signi®cant dimer population in the micromolar concentration range Â (Kd  10 to 30 mM) (Rose et al., 1992; Yoo et al., 1997). Structure determination Numerous signals in the [15N,1H]-HSQC spectrum of HTLV-I CA exhibited signi®cant overlap and poor sensitivity. These problems were largely eliminated by use of perdeuterated protein samples (Khorasanizadeh et al., 1999). Backbone assignments were made for all atoms except the NH

group of Thr191 and a portion of the N-tag (Gly-6(His)10-Ser6-Ser7), all of which appear to be involved in rapid HN chemical exchange with solvent protons. Side-chain assignments and distance restraints were derived from 3D 15N and 13C-edited and 4D 15N/15N, 15N/13C and 13C/13C-edited NOESY spectra (Clore & Gronenborn, 1991; È Grzesiek et al., 1995; Wuthrich, 1986). Details regarding the sequence-speci®c resonance assignments for HTLV-I CA have been noted (Khorasanizadeh et al., 1999). A total of ten a-helical and two 310-helical segments were identi®ed from the NOE cross-peak patterns and the Ca, Cb, C' and Ha chemical shift indices (Wishart & Sykes, 1994). The a-helices were identi®ed on the basis of strong intensity HN-HN i  1) and weaker intensity Ha-HN i  3) (i, (i, and Ha-Hb i  3) NOEs. These assignments were (i, supported by the observation of slow chemical exchange with water protons for many of the backbone amide protons in these regions (Figure 2). Segments with 310-helical structure were identi®ed on the basis of weak Ha-HN i  2) NOE cross-peaks (i, (Figure 2) detected in a 3D 15N-edited NOESY spectrum and tertiary contacts involving side-chain interactions identi®ed in the 4D 13C/15N and 13 C/13C-edited NOESY spectra. Only one longrange HN-HN NOE was observed, and this was for protons on adjacent strands of a mini-b-sheet in the CTD. Residues of the N and C-terminal tails (all amino acids preceding residue 15 and following residue 206, respectively) and the linker segment (residues 128 to 130) do not exhibit medium or long-range NOEs that would be consistent with regular secondary or tertiary structure. With the exception of uncertainty for Pro141, all 14 proline residues exhibit sequential Ha-Hd NOEs consistent with a trans peptide conformation. A representative plane from the 13C/13C-edited 4D NOESY spectrum in Figure 3 shows numerous long-range interproton dipolar interactions associated with one of the side-chain methyl groups of Leu155. A total of 1891 interproton distance restraints, including 358 short-range (jj À ij < 2), 914 medium-range (1 < jj À ij < 5), and 574 longrange (jj À ij > 4) restraints, were derived from the NOE data. In addition, 124 dihedral angle restraints derived from the 13Ca chemical shifts È (Luginbuhl et al., 1995), and 81 hydrogen-bonding restraints identi®ed on the basis of NOE cross-peak patterns and reduced HN chemical exchange rates, were used for structure calculations (see Table 1). Due to the absence of NOEs between the N and Cterminal domains, the initial rounds of structure calculations were carried for each domain independently until optimal target functions were obtained (distance and dihedral angle violations of less than Ê 0.2 A and 0.05 radians, respectively). Subsequently, a set of 20 structures with total penalties (sum of Ê the square of the distance violations) of 0.63 A2 or Ê less and maximum individual violations of 0.17 A or less were generated for the intact protein using random initial atom coordinates. Considering the

experimentally restrained residues (ranges 15-127 and 131-205) in the ®nal structures, 82 % have backbone torsion angles that map to the most favored regions of the Ramachandran map, 16.6 % are in additional allowed regions, and only 0.5 % are in disallowed regions (Laskowski et al., 1996). Statistical information (Table 1) and stereo views of the best ®t superpositions of the backbone atoms (Figure 4) demonstrate that the calculations

afforded structures with low residual distance violations and high intra-domain convergence. Superpositions of the backbone heavy atoms of the NTD and CTD residues afford average pairwise Ê RMS deviations of 0.77(Æ0.13) and 0.68(Æ0.12) A, respectively (Table 1). Description of the structure and comparison with capsid proteins from the lentiviruses HIV-1 and EIAV The HTLV-I CA consists of independently folded N and C-terminal domains (residues 15-127 and 131-206, respectively) with overall dimensions of Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê 45 A Â 25 A Â 15 A and 30 A Â 17 A Â 13 A, respectively (Figure 5). Residues of the interdomain linker (residues 128-130) do not exhibit long-range 1H-1H NOEs, show high HN exchange rates, and exhibit backbone {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs consistent with a high degree of ¯exibility (unpublished results). In addition, no inter-domain 1 H-1H NOEs were observed. These results indicate that the two domains do not tumble in solution as a single globular domain, but instead behave as independently folded domains without a preference for a particular relative orientation. This ¯exibility may be functionally important, allowing large-scale inter-domain adjustments during core particle assembly and disassembly. In addition, this ¯exibility could allow different CA molecules to exhibit different inter-domain orientations in the assembled capsid core. The overall architecture of HTLV-I CA resembles those of the lentiviral capsid proteins (see Figure 6). Best-®t superpositions of the backbone atoms

of the a-helices of the HTLV-I CA NTD with the analogous NTDs of the HIV-1 (Gitti et al., 1996) and EIAV (Jin et al., 1999) capsid proteins afford Ê pairwise RMS deviations of 2.36 A (Table 1 and Ê Figure 6(a)) and 2.40 A, respectively. All retroviral capsid proteins contain a conserved aspartate in the NTD that has been shown to form a salt bridge with the N-terminal proline in the HIV-1 NTD (Gitti et al., 1996). Although the conserved aspartate is located in similar positions in the HIV-1 and HTLV-I NTDs, our HTLV-I CA construct lacks the native N-terminal residues to yield the putative salt bridge. Instead, the Asp54 side-chain makes an interaction with the side-chain of the His-tag residue His14. Note that the residues that form the Nterminal b-hairpin in HIV-1 NTD, which was proposed to play a role in proteolytic capsid assembly (Gitti et al., 1996; von Schwedler et al., 1998), have been deleted in our HTLV-I construct. The EIAV CA used in the X-ray structural studies also contained a truncated N terminus. However, in both cases the modi®cations do not appear to have in¯uenced the overall structure of the NTD (Figure 6(a)). The NTD of HIV-1 CA also contains a proline-rich, partially ordered loop between helices H4 and H5 that functions by binding CypA. The analogous residues in the EIAV CA

crystal structure and the HTLV-I NMR structure are not disordered and exhibit well-de®ned conformations. The implications of these ®ndings for potential CypA binding to HTLV-I CA are discussed below. The CTD of HTLV-I CA consists of a 310-helix, four a-helices and a short two-stranded parallel bsheet. Except for the orientation of helix H11, the folding of the CTD of HTLV-I CA is also generally similar to the folding observed for the HIV-1 and EIAV CTDs. Differences related to the orientation of helix H11 appear to be related to differences in oxidation state of the conserved cysteine residues in helices H11 and H12 (see below). Best-®t superpositions of the backbone heavy atoms of the helical residues (excluding helix H11) of the HTLV-I CTD with those of the HIV-1 and EIAV CTDs Ê afford pairwise RMS deviations of 1.42 A Ê , respectively.

sequence of other capsid proteins from different retroviral genera. Figure 7 shows a structure-based sequence alignment relating the secondary structures in the HTLV/BLV and lentivirus families to those of the homologous B, C and D-type retroviruses. Except for the proline-rich segment between helices H4 and H7, which exhibits a large degree of sequence variation both in length and composition, a high degree of overall similarity exists. Among the HTLV/BLV genus the sequence similarity is extremely high, and it is likely that the CAs from HTLV-II, BLV and STLV (sequence identity with HTLV-I CA  83 %, 43 % and 83 %, respectively) adopt very similar folds to that observed here for HTLV-I CA. This is in contrast to the sequences of the matrix and nucleocapsid regions of the gag precursor for this genus, in which the sequence identities are much lower. The structure-based sequence comparisons suggest that retroviral capsid proteins from the different genera contain independent, structurally similar NTDs and CTDs. The highly conserved hydrophobic residues in the NTD stabilize coiledcoil-like interactions; for example, conservatively substituted residues Leu20, Ile23, Val27, Phe37, Met38, Ile41, Val45, Leu55, Leu58, Leu62, Trp117, Leu118 and Phe121 promote the packing of ahelices H1-H3 and H7 (see Figures 6(a) and 7). Helix H4 is partially stabilized through conserved

interactions with helix H7 (residues Leu75, Ile79, Ala82 from helix H4 and residues Leu109, Leu116 and Tyr 113 from helix H7) and does not make contacts with helix H3, resulting in a ¯at overall shape that is very different from the more symmetrical shapes of typical globular proteins. The connecting region between helices H4 and H7 is a region of poor sequence conservation whose threedimensional structure appears to vary signi®cantly among retroviral capsid proteins (see Figures 6(a) and 7). This loop extends outside of the protein core and its size and conformation is not expected to in¯uence the packing of the conserved structural elements. On the other hand, this region may be positioned to form alternative structures that in¯uence the supermolecular organization in the core particle. Unlike the relatively large sequence vari-

Figure 6. Comparison of the HTLV-I CA structure (yellow) with those of the isolated HIV-1 CA (orange) (a) NTD and (b) CTD. The HIV-1 NTD contains a b-hairpin at the N terminus that is not present in the HTLV-I CA structure due to a 15-residue N-terminal deletion. Proline 90 of HIV-1 CA NTD, which binds cyclophilin A, is drawn in green along with the analogous Pro96 of HTLV-I CA. Unlike HIV-1, HTLV-I CA does not bind CypA. The arrow in (b) denotes a 36  difference in the relative orientations of helix H11 (see the text).

ations in the NTDs, the CTDs exhibit higher overall similarity; the sequence identity between HTLV-I and HIV-1 CA CTDs is 32 %. Residues 136 to 158 of the MHR adopt a strand-turn-a-helix (H9) structure, and play a signi®cant role in stabilizing the fold through numerous van der Waals interactions. For example, Figure 3 shows the long-range NOEs observed between the side-chain methyl group of a centrally located residue in the MHR, Leu155, to the side-chain protons of residues Ile168, Leu169 and Leu172 of helix H10. Several speci®c hydrogen bonds also stabilize this local conformation; in particular, the side-chain NH2 of Gln155 forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Glu159 in the HIV-1 CA CTD (Gamble et al., 1997). Although the NMR data did not permit the unambiguous assignment of speci®c hydrogen-bonding partners, the analogous residue in HTLV-I CA, Gln138, exhibits unusual up®eld and down®eldshifted side-chain NH2 nitrogen (107.70 ppm) and proton (8.17, 6.52 ppm) NMR chemical shifts, respectively, and is poised to form a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl group of Glu142 (analogous to Glu159 in HIV-1 CA). Interestingly, the side-chain carbonyl group of this conserved residue is also poised to possibly accept a hydrogen bond from the sulfhydryl proton of Cys181. This local structure is likely to be highly conserved among the retroviral capsid proteins based on the sequence identity shown in Figure 7. HTLV-I CA does not bind cyclophilin-A in vitro The HIV-1 capsid protein contains a Ala88Gly89-Pro90-Ile91 sequence that binds CypA (Franke et al., 1994b; Gamble et al., 1996; Luban et al., 1993; Thali et al., 1994). As shown in Figure 7, the sequence of HTLV-I CA also contains this

motif (Ala94-Gly95-Pro96-Leu97) in a similar location, which suggests that this protein might also bind CypA. To test this hypothesis, [15N, 1 H]-HSQC NMR data were obtained for HTLV-I CA in the absence and presence of added CypA. No changes were observed in the NMR spectrum of HTLV-I CA, even when CypA was added to equimolar (1 mM) concentrations, indicating that the protein does not have a signi®cant af®nity for CypA in vitro. The CypA binding site in HIV-1 CA exists in an exposed, remarkably ¯exible loop that could readily interact with CypA (Campos-Olivas & Summers, 1999). In contrast, the analogous residues in HTLV-I CA are conformationally constrained and partially buried between helices H4 and H7 (Figure 6(a)). Thus, this sequence in HTLV-I CA does not bind CypA and would be unable to do so without a major structural rearrangement. Conserved cysteine residues are reduced in HTLV-I CA Except for members of the C-type and spumavirus genera, all retroviral CA CTDs contain a pair of conserved cysteine residues that correspond to Cys181 and Cys202 in HTLV-I CA, and Cys198 and Cys218 in HIV-1 CA. The sulfur atoms of these cysteine residues are separated by Ê 6.2(Æ1.6) A in the HTLV-I CA NMR structure, indicating that they do not form an intramolecular disul®de bond. The 13Cb chemical shifts of these Cys residues (27.37 ppm for Cys181 and 29.21 ppm for Cys202) are indicative of a reduced oxidation state (Wishart et al., 1995). Furthermore, quantitative Ellman assays (Ellman, 1959; Riddles et al., 1983) demonstrated that the protein contains three free sulfhydryl groups. Since the protein con-

Representatives of other retroviral capsid proteins that have been aligned include: B-type, MMTV; avian C-type, RSV; D-type, MPMV (Vogt, 1997a). The CA sequences in spumaviruses and mammalian C-type retroviruses are very different and are not shown here. Black boxes denote groups of identical residues and conservatively substituted hydrophobic residues. The residue numbers and secondary structure are labelled according to those observed here for HTLV-I CA.

tains only three Cys residues (Cys63 is in the NTD), these results con®rm that conserved cysteine residues 181 and 202 are reduced in our HTLV-I CA samples. In contrast, the analogous cysteine residues form an intramolecular disul®de bond in the X-ray structures of the isolated HIV-1 CA CTD (Gamble et al., 1997; Worthylake et al., 1999), as well as in the EIAV CA X-ray structure (Jin et al., 1999). Very recently, the structure of the intact HIV-1 Ê capsid protein has been determined at 3 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The protein was crystallized as a complex with a Fab fragment, with the Fab binding to the CTD (BerthetColominas et al., 1999), and exhibited an unexpected head-to-tail dimer interface with extensive NTD-to-CTD intermolecular interactions. The CTD

in this structure is distorted compared to the structures of the isolated HIV-1 and EIAV CTDs; in particular, residues in the dimerization helix H10 Ê exhibit an RMS deviation (Ca atoms) of 4.4 A compared with the isolated HIV-1 CA CTD structure (Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999). The sulfur atoms of the conserved cysteine residues do not appear to from a disul®de (the Sg atoms are separated by Ê 4.1 A), but this has been attributed to high radiation doses used for data collection and does not appear to have signi®cantly affected the structure of the CTD (Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999). Instead, the differences in CTD structure have been attributed to extensive Fab interactions with the CTD, as well as to the fact that the CTD forms a completely different dimer interface with the NTD of the adjacent monomer. Because the Fab binding

500 occurs in a region very close to the conserved cysteine residues and makes extensive contacts with helix H11, it is dif®cult to evaluate the relative in¯uence of the cysteine oxidation states on the CTD conformation in this structure. A potential oxidative assembly mechanism As indicated above, the CTD of HIV-1 CA forms dimers with af®nity similar to that of the fulllength protein (Kd  18 mM) (Gamble et al., 1997). In contrast, the HTLV-I CA does not form dimers, even at concentrations up to 1 mM. This ®nding is particularly surprising in view of the fact that retroviral CTDs contain the most highly conserved amino acid sequence among the retroviral proteins. The MHR adopts a very similar fold in the HTLV-I and HIV-1 CA CTDs (Figure 6(b)), consistent with the earlier ®ndings that the MHR does not participate directly in CTD dimerization (Gamble et al., 1997; Jin et al., 1999; Worthylake et al., 1999). Residues that make intermolecular contacts in the HIV-1 CA CTD are generally conservatively substituted among the retroviral capsid proteins (see Figure 7), and several of these are known to be critical for dimer formation and capsid assembly. Thus, mutation of either Met185 or Trp184 to Ala in HIV-1 CA abolishes dimerization (Gamble et al., 1997) and leads to defective capsid assembly in vitro (von Schwedler et al., 1998). Interestingly, several of these dimer interface residues are oriented differently in the HIV-1 and HTLV-I CTD structures (Figure 8). For example, the hydrophobic side-chain of Met185 of HIV-1 CA is directed toward the adjacent protein of the dimer and makes intermolecular contacts (Gamble et al., 1997; Worthylake et al., 1999), whereas the analogous residue Ile168 of HTLV-I CA is partially buried within the folded monomer (Figure 8). These structural differences are due to a small rotation of helix H10 relative to the analogous dimerization helix of HIV-1 CA, as well as a much larger 36  change in

Structure of HTLV-I Capsid Protein

the orientation of helix H11 (Figures 6(b) and 8). In the HIV-1 CA CTD structure, the N terminus Ê of helix H11 is approximately 2 A closer to the C terminus of helix H12, and this appears to be due to the covalent linking of the helices through disul®de bond formation (Figure 8). Thus, the observed structural differences between the CTDs of HTLV-I and HIV-1 appear to be due to differences in the oxidation states of the cysteine residues. The same structural differences are observed when comparing the HTLV-1 CA CTD with that of EIAV (the sequence identity between the CTDs of EIAV and HIV-1 is 37 %) providing further evidence that it is the differences in the cysteine oxidation states, rather than intrinsic amino acid sequences, that are responsible for differences in the HTLV-I CTD and HIV-1/EIAV CTD helix orientations. The capsid proteins in freshly prepared HIV-1 particles do not contain signi®cant amounts of disul®de bonds (McDermott et al., 1996), consistent with the reduced state of our HTLV-I CA NMR structure. However, the cysteine residues are oxidized in the X-ray structures of both the isolated HIV-1 CA CTD dimers, as well as in the EIAV CTD. (As indicated above, the apparent reduced state of the recent HIV-1 CA CTD appears to be artifactual.) The HIV-1 CTD readily oxidizes in solution (unpublished results), and even forms disul®des when crystallized in the presence of reducing agents (Worthylake et al., 1999). In addition, substitution of either of these essential cysteine residues by serine in HIV-1 CA abolishes viral replication (McDermott et al., 1996). The combined data indicate that the conserved cysteine residues of HIV-1 CA probably form a disul®de bond at some point during the virus replication cycle, most likely after the virus enters the oxidizing environment of the bloodstream (Worthylake et al., 1999). Thus, oxidation-dependent conformational changes, similar to those re¯ected by the comparisons in Figure 8, may either facilitate capsid core particle assem-

bly or prime the capsid core for disassembly during the subsequent infectivity stage of the replication cycle. This proposed function for the conserved cysteine residues is not without precedent. Conserved cysteine residues in the capsid proteins of the Papovaviradae family of viruses appear to form capsid-stabilizing intermolecular disul®de bonds upon the release of virions from infected cells. The resulting cystine residues are subsequently reduced upon entering a new host cell to allow capsid disassembly and infection (Christiansen et al., 1977; Harrison et al., 1996; Sapp et al., 1998; Walter & Deppert, 1974).

Materials and Methods
Cloning, protein purification and characterization DNA encoding the HTLV-I capsid protein (GenBank Accession no. L03561), containing either residues 1-214 or 16-214, were ampli®ed from the proviral K30 plasmid (Zhao et al., 1995) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR primers were designed to introduce NdeI (5H ) and BamHI (3H ) cloning sites and introduce a stop codon immediately following the capsid coding sequence. The ampli®ed DNA fragments were subcloned into the NdeIBamHI site of the phage T7 RNA polymerase-based expression vectors pET11a and pET16b (Novagen). Recombinant plasmids were puri®ed, con®rmed by dideoxy sequencing, and introduced into the E. coli cell line HMS174 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Transformed cells carrying the recombinant HTLV-I construct, residues 16-214 with a His-tag, were grown on a modi®ed M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and/or U-[13C]glucose (as the only sources of nitrogen and carbon) in either H2O or 99 % 2H2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at 37  C. Protein expression was induced early in the log phase (A600 $ 0.5) by the addition of IPTG to 1 mM. Cells were harvested ten hours (15 hours in 2H2O) after induction at 30  C, with the ®nal A600 > 2. Protein was puri®ed using nickel af®nity chromatography (Qiagen Ni-NTA; >90 % pure protein eluted using an imidazole gradient) followed by puri®cation to homogeneity using a strong cation exchange media (Poros HS). Unless otherwise mentioned, protein was typically studied under buffer condition of 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl at pH 6.0. Protein concentrations were estimated using experimentally determined extinction coef®cient of the protein (Gill & von Hippel, 1989). Ellman reagent (Ellman, 1959; Riddles et al., 1983) (Pierce) in reaction buffer of 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) was used to determine the number of free thiol groups of the protein under native condition. Optical density at 412 nm was measured (using e412  14,150 MÀ1 cmÀ1) to quantify free thiol groups per mol of HTLV-I CA. The elution pro®le of the pure protein on a size-exclusion column (Superdex75 medium, 80 cm-long, optimum range of separation 3-70 kDa, Pharmacia) was determined using a 5 mg mlÀ1 protein solution in 20 mM BTP, 300 mM NaCl (pH 6.0) and running at the ¯ow rate of 1 ml minÀ1. The molecular mass was estimated based on the elution pro®le of standards ranging from 66 kDa (bovine serum albumin) to 14.3 kDa (lysozyme), determined under the same conditions. Velocity and equilibrium sedimentation Centrifugation studies were carried out on an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge instrument (Beckman). The following rotor speeds were used for measurements: 60,000 rpm for the velocity run, and three different speeds of 26,000, 30,000, and 33,000 rpm for the equilibrium run. Protein solutions at 6, 12 and 24 mM were centrifuged at 20  C. Samples were ®ltered with a 0.25 mm pore-sized membrane prior to measurements. Absorbance pro®les were measured at 280 nm and were collected until protein distribution had reached equilibrium. Solvent density of 1.015 g mlÀ1, and a partial speci®c volume estimate of 0.7273 ml gÀ1, derived from the amino acid sequence of the HTLV-I CA, were used for the analysis. Equilibrium distributions were ®t to a single

Conclusions
The present studies provide the ®rst structural data for a non-lentiviral capsid protein and demonstrate that, despite relatively low sequence identity ($20 %), the capsid proteins of HTLV-I, HIV-1 and EIAV adopt similar three-dimensional folds. Based on comparisons of primary and tertiary structural data, it is likely that the retroviral capsid proteins of all but the spumavirus and mammalian C-type genera adopt similar three-dimensional structures, consisting of independently folded and predominantly helical N and C-terminal domains. The surprising ®nding that HTLV-I CA is monomeric, even at high protein concentrations, may be attributed to the oxidation state of conserved cysteine residues in the C-terminal domain. Whereas these cysteine residues are reduced in the present HTLV-I CA sample, the analogous cysteine residues participate in a disul®de bond in the Cterminal domains of the HIV-1 and EIAV capsid proteins. Thus, the differences in relative orientation of helices H10 and H11 appear to be coupled to differences in the oxidation state of the conserved cysteine residues, with disul®de bond formation resulting in greater exposure of conservatively substituted hydrophobic residues in helix H10. It is precisely these residues that promote oligomerization in the HIV-1 CA C-terminal domain. Although the capsid proteins in freshly prepared HIV-1 particles contain predominantly reduced cysteine residues, consistent with our HTLV-I CA structure, the substitution of one or both of these cysteine residues by serine abolishes infectivity, indicating that disul®de formation may be important at some stage during the retroviral replication cycle (McDermott et al., 1996). Our studies suggest that disul®de formation, which probably occurs as the budding virion enters the oxidizing environment of the bloodstream, may trigger a conformational change in the CTD that either promotes capsid assembly or primes the capsid core for subsequent viral entry steps. Efforts to test these ideas by examining the oxidation-dependent structures of the HIV-1 and HTLV-I capsid proteins are underway.

homogenous species model using the non-linear leastsquares ®tting algorithm provided with the XL-A data analysis software. Dynamic light scattering Dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out on a DynaPro-801 instrument equipped with a 12 ml microsampler (Protein Solutions, Inc.). Samples were ®ltered through a 0.05 mm pore-sized membrane (Whatman) prior to measurements. Data were collected for protein at room temperature in buffer at concentrations ranging from 40 mM to 400 mM. The Stokes-Einstein equation was used to determine hydrodynamic radius from the translational diffusion coef®cient. Protein molecular mass was estimated using bimodal analysis and assuming a globular protein conformation using the DYNALS data analysis software. NMR spectroscopy NMR samples (U-15N; U-15N/13C; and U-15N/13C/2H) contained 1-1.5 mM protein in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT in H2O:2H2O:dioxane (90:5:5), or 2H2O:dioxane (95:5). All NMR studies were carried out at 30  C on a Bruker AVANCE 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm z-gradient triple resonance probe. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) and analyzed with NMRView (Johnson & Blevins, 1994). Details of data collection and sequence-speci®c assignment have previously been reported (Khorasanizadeh et al., 1999). Brie¯y, perdeuterated sample was used for triple-resonance 3D spectra to obtain the sequential assignments for the backbone 1HN, 13Ca,b and 15N resonances. The following NOESY spectra were used to complete the assignments and obtain distance restraints for structure determination (unless otherwise mentioned a NOESY mixing time of 100 ms was used): 4D 15N/15N-edited NOESY (tmix  200 ms) (Grzesiek et al., 1995) recorded for a triply labelled (U-2H/13C/15N) sample, 4D 15N/13C and 13 C/13C-edited (recorded with sample in 2H2O) NOESY spectra recorded for a U-13C/15N-labelled sample È (Wuthrich, 1986; Clore & Gronenborn, 1991), 3D 15N-edited and 2D (recorded with sample in 2H2O) NOESY spectra for 15N-labelled sample, and a 3D 13C-edited NOESY spectrum obtained for a U-13C/15N-labelled sample in 2H2O. Amide hydrogen exchange was detected by dissolving a lyophilized sample of 15Nlabelled protein in fully deuterated buffer and collecting [15N,1H] HSQC spectra (15 minute acquisition time). Residues unambiguously detected in the ®rst spectrum were identi®ed as having a slow exchanging 1HN. Structure calculations Structures of HTLV-I CA were calculated in torsion angle space with a variable target function-simulated È annealing protocol using DYANA (Guntert et al., 1997). NOE-derived upper limit interproton distance restraints Ê Ê Ê Ê of 2.9 A, 3.3 A, 5.0 A and 5.5 A were employed for qualitatively observed NOESY cross-peaks of strong, medium, weak and very weak intensity, respectively, which were normalized in different spectra to account for different inherent experimental sensitivities.

Backbone dihedral angle restraints were obtained from the analysis È of the 13Ca chemical shifts (Luginbuhl et al., 1995). Figures showing molecular structures were generated with MolScript (Kraulis, 1991) and rendered with Raster 3D (Bacon & Anderson, 1988). CypA purification and binding Recombinant human CypA was over-expressed using the WISP94-1 construct in BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli strain as described (Yoo et al., 1997). CypA was ®rst run over a cation exchange column (Poros HS). The ¯ow-through, which contained CypA, was used to obtain >95 % pure protein by a subsequent size-exclusion chromatography step using Sephadex-75 media (Pharmacia). CypA concentration was estimated using e280  8500 MÀ1 cmÀ1. In vitro af®nity of CypA for HTLV-I CA was investigated using 2D NMR. Unlabelled CypA was titrated into a solution of 15N/2H-labelled HTLV-I CA to obtain ®nal CypA concentrations of 0.2, 0.6 and 1.1 mM while maintaining HTLV-I CA concentration at 0.8 mM in buffer (50 mM phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) in H2O:2H2O (95:5). The 2D HSQC spectra were collected at 800 MHz and 30  C at each CypA concentration and were compared with the HSQC spectrum of pure 15 N/2H-labelled HTLV-I CA. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The atomic coordinates of the ensemble of solution structures of HTLV-I CA have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession number 1QRJ.
