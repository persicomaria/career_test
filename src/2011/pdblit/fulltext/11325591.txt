Received October 2, 1980 The complete amino acid sequence of the b-subunit of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was determined. The p-subunit contained four methionine residues. Thus, five peptides were obtained after cleavage of the carboxymethylated &subunit with cyanogen bromide, The amino acid sequences and were isolated on Sephadex G-75 column chromatography. of the cyanogen bromide peptides were established by characterization of the peptides obtained after digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, or Staphylococcus aureus protease. The major sequencing techniques used were automated and manual Edman degradations. The five cyanogen bromide peptides were aligned by means of the amino acid sequences of the peptides containing methionine purified from the tryptic hydrolysate of the carboxymethylated &subunit. The amino acid sequence of all the 238 residues was as follows: Pro-Ala-Gln-Asp-Asn-Ser-Arg-Phe-Val-Ile-Arg-Asp-Arg-Asn-Trp-HisPro-Lys-Ala-Leu-Thr-Pro-Asp - Tyr-Lys-Thr-Ser-Ile-Ala-Arg-Ser-Pro-Arg-Gln-AlaLeu-Val-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln-Ser - Ile-Ser-Glu-Thr-Thr-Gly-Pro-Asn-Phe-Ser-His-LeuGly-Phe-Gly-Ala-His-Asp-His - Asp-Leu-Leu-Leu-Asn-Phe-Asn-Asn-Gly-Gly-LeuPro-Ile-Gly-Glu-Arg-Ile-Ile - Val-Ala-Gly-Arg-Val-Val-Asp-Gln-Tyr-Gly-Lys-ProVal-Pro-Asn-Thr-Leu-Val-Glu-Met - Trp-Gln-Ala-Asn-Ala-Gly-Gly-Arg-Tyr-ArgHis-Lys-Asn-Asp-Arg-Qr-Leu-Ala-Pro - Leu-Asp-Pro-Asn-Phe-Gly-Gly-Val-GlyArg-Cys-Leu-Thr-Asp-Ser-Asp-Gly-wr-Tyr - Ser-Phe-Arg-Thr-Ile-Lys-Pro-Gly-Pro- Trp-Arg-Pro-Ala-His-Ile-His-Phe-Gly-IleTyr-Pro-Trp-Arg-Asn-Gly-Pro-Asn-Asp Ser-Gly-Pro-Ser-Ile-Ala-Thr-Lys - Leu-Ile-Thr-Gln-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Glu-Gly-Asp-ProLeu-Ile-Pro-Met-Cys-Pro-Ile-Val - Lys-Ser-Ile-Ala-Asn-Pro-Glu-Ala-Val-Gln-GlnLeu-Ile-Ala-Lys-Leu-Asp-Met-Asn-Asn - Ala-Asn-Pro-Met-Asn-Cys-Leu-Ala-TyrArg-Phe-Asp-Ile-Val-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gln-Arg-Lys-Thr-His-Phe-Glu-Asn-Cys. The sequence published earlier in summary form (Iwaki et al., 1979, J. Biochem. 86.1159-1162) contained a few errors which are pointed out in this paper.

Protocatechuate 3,bdioxygenase catalyzes the ring cleavage reaction of protocatechuic acid to form @-carboxymuconic acid (1). The enzyme has been obtained in a crystalline form from Pseudomonas ueru&nosa (2).

assigned to residues 35 to 39 of CBlT8. These results are also inconsistent with those in the previous paper (33), in which Asn-Asp-Gly-Leu was given as the sequence. In the previous experiment, we failed to isolate CBlT8C3a, an intact peptide, and the sequence analyses had to be carried out with the modified peptide, for which Edman degradation could not be used. Therefore, the sequence was deduced only from the results of analyses of two thermolytic peptides and carboxypeptidase digestion. In addition, amino acid analyses showed 5.6 and 2.4 in the number of glycine residues in CBlT8 and CBlT8C3b, respectively, that led us to conclude that CBlT8C3b contained two glytine residues because glycine often tends to show high value in yield. These inade-

quate evidences led us to draw the erroneous conclusion. But, we should have made more efforts to obtain clear data of amino acid analyses and to search for CBlT8C3a. The fact that no phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids are released from CBlT8S after seven steps of Edman degradation is also due to the /3 transition mentioned above. The sequence of CB2 was deduced by aligning the tryptic peptides (Fig. 15). In the tryptic peptides, CB2T6, composed of 12 residues, was isolated unexpectedly from fraction 8 in Fig. 8. Its delay must be due to the interaction of the peptide with Bio-Gel beads, because it contained three aromatic amino acids. The nine tryptic peptides (CB2Tl-CB2T9) accounted for all the lysine and arginine residues in CB2.

Three tryptic peptides overlapped the COOH-terminal residues of thermolytic peptides by only one residue (Cys-129, Thr141, and Leu-174). The reliability of these overlaps, mentioned under Results, are further supported by the fact that these amino acids are followed by leucine or isoleucine, which is consistent with the specificity of thermolysin. The sequence of CB3, CB4, and CB5 was determined with no ambiguities. The COOH-terminal residue of CB5 was assigned as carboxymethylcysteine. Since CB5 was the COOH-terminal peptides of carboxymethylcysteine RCM-P-subunit, must be the COOH-terminus of the RCMP-subunit.

In the previous work (6), the COOH-terminal residue of RCM-@-sobunit could not be detected by three different methods, that is, carboxypeptidase digestions, the selective tritium labeling method, and hydrazinolysis. The reason for this is now under investigation. The selective covalent binding method (31) for methionine-containing peptides was successfully applied in this work to obtain the overlapping peptides of the BrCN peptides. The NHz-terminus of TM2 was proline, which is a rare NHz-terminal residue of tryptic peptides. Since this proline was preceded by aspartic acid in the total sequence of the RCM-P-subunit, this peptide was probably obtained by the cleavage of the Asp-Pro bond in the par18

Thanks are also due to Drs. H. Matsubara and T. Hase of Osaka University for their valuable discussions and for making the solid-phase sequencer available to us, to Dr. T. Murachi of Kyoto University for making the liquid-phase sequencer available to us, and to Drs. Y. Saeki and T. Yagi for their interest and valuable advice. The technical assistance of Mr. A Miyatake is greatly appreciated. This work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Japan. The data were taken from a dissertation given by M. Iwaki in 1980 to the Graduate School of Kyoto University in partial fulfilment of the requirements of a degree of Doctor of Medical Science. REFERENCES 1. STANIER, R. Y., AND INGRAHAM, J. L.

ent tryptic peptide under the acidic conditions (37) during the covalent binding procedure. Thus, the proposed sequence of the psubunit shown in Fig. 15 is believed to be the complete sequence and no residues have been missed. Protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase consists of two nonidentical subunits, (Y and /3, and the molecular composition is believed to be ((~&)s in the functional enzyme (6). Recently, the complete sequence of the a-subunit was established by Kohlmiller and Howard (11,12). Figure 16 (see miniprint supplement) compares the sequence of the P-subunit with that of the a-subunit (11,12). The P-subunit contained 38 residues more than a-subunit. When both sequences are put side by side with introduction of some gaps to achieve maximum homology, the COOH-terminal halves seem to have more homology than the NHz-terminal halves have. It is remarkable that the common sequences, Ala-Tyr-Arg-Phe-Asp-Ile and Leu-IleAla-Lys are present near the COOH-termini. These findings suggest that these two subunits may have a common ancestral form. It is of interest to note that pyrocatechase, another intradiol-type dioxygenase, also consists of two nonidentical subunits, cuand & and that both subunits show evident homology in their NHz-terminal sequences up to residue 21 (38). The protomer of protocatechuate 3,4dioxygenase (cy&) contains 1 g atom of ferric iron and at least one tyrosyl residue is coordinated to the iron (6, 8). However, no information has so far been available as to which tyrosyl residues in these sequences are involved in the iron ligation. The modification experiments of tyrosyl residues are now progressing in our laboratory together with the sequence studies on the other catechol-cleaving dioxygenases including pyrocatechase, which also has a ferric iron center coordinated by tyrosy1 residues (39). These studies may provide important information on understanding the structure of the iron center as well as evolutionary relationships of these dioxygenases.
