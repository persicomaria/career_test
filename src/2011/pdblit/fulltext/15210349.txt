Abstract 2-Keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase (KDGK) catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, a key intermediate in the modified (semi-phosphorylative) Entner­Doudoroff (ED) glucose metabolic pathway. We identified the gene (ORF ID: ST2478) encoding KDGK in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus tokodaii based on the structure of a gene cluster in a genomic database and functionally expressed it in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein was purified from crude extract by heat treatment and two conventional column chromatography steps, and the partial amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of the purified enzyme (MAKLIT) was identical to that obtained from the gene sequence. The purified enzyme was extremely thermostable and retained full activity after heating at 80 °C for 1 h. The enzyme utilized ATP or GTP, but not ADP or AMP, as a phosphoryl donor and 2-keto3-deoxy-D-gluconate or 2-keto-D-gluconate as a phosphoryl acceptor. Divalent cations including Mg2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+ or Mn2+ were required for activity, and the apparent Km values for KDG and ATP at 50 °C were 0.027 mM and 0.057 mM, respectively. The presence of KDGK means that the hyperthermophilic archaeon S. tokodaii metabolizes glucose via both modified (semi-phosphorylative) and non-phosphorylative ED pathways. Ó 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Many identified hyperthermophiles growing at temperatures near or above the boiling point of water belong to Archaea, the third domain of life [1], and such hyperthermophilic archaea are known to possess specific and novel metabolic systems for material and energy production that differ from those in bacteria, plants, and animals [2]. Particularly interesting to us is the unique sugar metabolism seen in anaerobic hyper*

thermophilic archaea such as Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis, which involves a modified Embden­Meyerhof pathway containing several novel enzymes, including ADP-dependent glucokinase and phosphofructokinase, ferredoxin-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase [3,4]. What's more, hyperthermophilic archaea exhibit a notable diversity of sugar metabolic pathways. For instance, a normal Embden­Meyerhof pathway involving ATP-dependent glucokinase was identified as a glycolic pathway in the aerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon

Aerophyrum pernix [5], while a non-phosphorylative Entner­Doudoroff (ED)1 pathway was identified as the glycolytic pathway in the aerobic and acidophilic hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus [6] and S. acidocaldarius [7]. The first step of the latter pathway entails oxidation of glucose to gluconate catalyzed by an NAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase, after which gluconate is dehydrated to 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate (KDG) by gluconate dehydratase, and KDG is cleaved to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde by KDG aldolase (Fig. 1, left branch). In addition to this non-phosphorylative ED pathway, Ahmed et al. [8] identified a modified ED pathway in S. solfatoricus using comparative genomic and enzymatic analyses, which they described as being semi-phosphorylative (Fig. 1, right branch). A key feature of this modified pathway is that 2-keto-3deoxy-gluconate kinase (KDGK, E.C. 2.7.1.45) catalyzes the phosphorylation of KDG using ATP as the phosphoryl donor. The product of S. solfatoricus kdgK gene has been confirmed to exhibit KDGK activity [9]. However, the details of the enzymological and catalytic properties of archaeal KDGK remain unknown. We therefore searched for the gene encoding KDGK in a genomic database and identified a gene (ORF ID: ST2478) encoding a putative fructokinase in another acidophilic hyperthermophilic archaeon, S. tokodaii [10]. Our aim in the present study was to express ST2478 in Escherichia coli and examine the enzymological properties of the purified product to obtain a better understanding of the modified ED pathway in S. tokodaii. Materials and methods Materials Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL and plasmid DNA pET11a were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA) and Novagen (Madison, WI, USA), respectively. Yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD, and NADP were all purchased from the Oriental Yeast Co. (Tokyo, Japan). ADP-dependent glucokinase was prepared from P. furiosus as previously described [6]. KDG was a gift from Drs. Noriyasu Ohshima, RIKEN (Wako, Saitama, Japan) and Yasuhiro Kajiwara, Yokohama City University (Yokohama, Japan). ATP, GTP, ITP, TTP, UTP, CTP, ADP, GDP, CDP, IDP, UDP, and AMP were all purchased from Sigma­Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All other chemicals were of reagent grade.

Cloning and expression of gene The complete sequence of the S. tokodaii genome was reported by Kawarabayasi et al. [10]. We used BLAST to identify the gene sequence (ST2478) encoding the putative KDGK within the S. tokodaii genome. The ST2478 gene fragment was amplified by PCR using a set of oligonucleotide primers containing a unique NdeI restriction site overlapping the 5 0 initiation codon (5 0 -TCTTTATCAT ATGGCTAAACTGATTAC-3 0 ) and containing a unique BamHI restriction site proximal to the 3 0 end of the termination codon (5 0 -GAGGATCCTTATTTTTTCATTT CTCTTAG-3 0 ). Chromosomal DNA from S. tokodaii was isolated and used as the template. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated into the expression vector pET11a linearlized with NdeI and BamHI. The hybrid DNA plasmid pET11a/ST2478 containing the ST2478 open-reading frame was a gift from Prof. Seiki Kuramitsu (Department of Biology, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). We used pET11a/ST2478 to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL cells, after which the transformants were aerobically cultivated at 37 °C in a 2-L flask containing 500 ml of medium containing 6 g of tryptone, 12 g of yeast extract, 2.5 ml of glycerol, 6.25 g K2HPO4, 1.9 g KH2PO4, and 25 mg of ampicillin. The cultivation was carried out until the OD600 reached about 0.6, at which time isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mM) was added for enzyme induction, and the cultivation was continued for an additional 3 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (15,000g for 10 min).

Purification of recombinant KDGK After washing the cells by suspension in 0.85% NaCl, they were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM 2mercaptoethanol (2-ME). The cells were then disrupted by ultrasonication and centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was collected as the crude extract and heated at 80 °C for 30 min, after which the denatured protein was removed by centrifugation (15,000g for 10 min). The supernatant was collected and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM 2-ME and 40% saturated ammonium sulfate, after which the dialyzate was applied on a Butyl Toyopearl column (1.5 cm · 10 cm) (Tosoh corporation, Tokyo) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted using a linear gradient of 40%­0% ammonium sulfate (total volume: 200 ml), and the active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM 2-ME. The dialyzate was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare UK, Buckinghamshire HP7 9NA, England) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM 2-ME and 0.2 M NaCl. After elution, the active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). This dialyzate was used as the purified enzyme preparation. Enzyme assay We have developed a novel spectrophotometric assay to measure KDGK activity (Fig. 2). In this assay, ADP formed from ATP during the KDGK reaction serves as the phosphoryl donor in the synthesis of glucose-6-phosphate in the first coupled reaction, catalyzed by P. furiosus ADP-dependent glucokinase (Asahi Kasei Pharma, Tokyo). The P. furiosus enzyme catalyzes ADP-dependent, ATP-independent phosphorylation of glucose, as previously described [11]. In the second coupled reaction, cata-

lyzed by NADP-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate, while NADP is stoichiometrically reduced to NADPH. The rate of NADPH formation was determined by spectrophotometric measurement at 340 nm. The standard reaction system consisted of 50 mM Tris/ HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mM KDG, 10 mM glucose, 2.5 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2Æ6H2O, 1 U of yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1 unit (U) of ADP-glucokinase, 1 mM NADP and the enzyme in a total volume of 1.00 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of ATP, and the increase of absorbance at 340 nm (emM = 6.22 mMÀ1 cmÀ1), indicative of NADPH formation, was followed at 50 °C. One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1 lmol of NADPH per min under the standard assay conditions, and the specific activity was expressed in U/(mg of protein). Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford [12], with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determination of molecular mass To determine the subunit molecular mass, SDS­PAGE (12% acrylamide slab gel, 1-mm thick) was carried out using the procedure of Laemmli [13], after which the protein bands were strained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250. The standard proteins (Prestained Protein Marker, Broad range, New England Biolabs, MA, USA) used to calibrate the molecular mass were MBP-b-galactosidase from E. coli (175 kDa), MBP-paramyosin (83 kDa), bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase (62 kDa), rabbit muscle aldolases (47.5 kDa), rabbit muscle triosephosphate isomerase (32.5 kDa), bovine milk b-lactoglobulin A (25 kDa), chicken egg white lysozyme (16.5 kDa), and bovine lung aprotinin (6.5 kDa). The molecular mass of the native KDGK molecule was determined by analytical gel filtration on a Superdex 200 (Pharmacia, Tokyo) column using 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 M NaCl. In this case, the standard proteins (Amersham Bioscience) used for calibration were bovine thyroid thyroglobulin (669 kDa), horse spleen ferritin (440 kDa), rabbit muscle aldolases (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) and bovine pancreas ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Effect of temperature and pH on enzyme activity, and the kinetic parameters The effect of temperature on enzymatic activity was examined by incubating the enzyme (about 0.40 mg/ml in the standard buffer) at various temperatures and then detecting the remaining activity at 50 °C. The effect of pH on the enzymatic activity was determined by carrying out the standard assay at 50 °C in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.0­6.0), Bis/Tris buffer (pH 6.0­7.0), Tris/HCl buffer

(pH 7.5­8.5), and glycine­NaOH buffer (pH 9.0­10.0). The pHs of buffers used were measured at 25 °C. The Michaelis constants (Km) were determined from Lineweaver­Burk [14] plots of data obtained from the initial velocity analysis at 50 °C. Substrate specificity and the effect of metal ions and reagents The capacity of 10 mM KG, D-gluconate, KDG, 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate or fructose to serve as the phosphoryl acceptor for KDGK was examined under the standard assay conditions. To determine the effect of metal ion on the activity, the purification step in which the enzyme solution was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 5 mM 2-ME and 1 mM EDTA (see above) was followed by dialysis against the same buffer solution without EDTA. The additional effect of MgCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, CuCl2, and CaCl2 on the activity was examined using HPLC to measure the formation of ADP from ATP instead of the spectrophotometric assay method. The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mM Tris/ HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mM KG, 2.5 mM ATP, 10 mM cation, and enzyme in a total volume of 0.5 ml. After incubation for 10 min at 50 °C, the reaction was stopped by incubation for 5 min in ice water, after which each solution was passed through a cellulose acetate filter (pore size; 0.2 mm, Advantec, Tokyo). An aliquot (20 ml) of each filtrate was applied on an HPLC column (7.6 mm · 25 cm) containing Asahipak GS320HQ (Asahi Chemical Industry, Shizuoka, Japan); 200 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 5.0) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The effluent from the column was monitored with a UV detector at a wavelength of 260 nm. ATP, ADP, and AMP were separated on the column and had retention times of about 17.5, 19.9, and 27.1 min, respectively. The enzyme's specificity for the phosphoryl donor was assessed using GTP, ITP, TTP, UTP, CTP, ADP, GDP, CDP, IDP, UDP, and AMP (each 2 mM) instead of ATP in the standard assay mixture. The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 50 °C, and the products (e.g., GDP and IDP from GTP and ITP, respectively) were measured using HPLC as described above. Results and discussion Enzymatic assay for KDGK We have constructed a novel spectrophotometric assay system that makes use of three coupled reactions to measure KDGK activity. With this assay system, there was a linear relationship between time and the increase in absorbance at 340 nm (NADPH formation; data not shown), so that the initial velocity of KDGK could be determined based on simple detection of the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. This spectrophotometric analysis is more useful than HPLC, as it enables simple and rapid assay of KDGK. To date, there have been only two enzymatic

methods for assaying KDGK activity described in the literature: the first is an NAD reductive assay based on coupled reactions catalyzed by 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase (KDPG) and non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [8]; the other is an NADH oxidative assay with ADP based on coupled reactions catalyzed by pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase [15]. With respect to the first method, the two enzymes used are not commercially available and are therefore hard to obtain. As for the second, NADH oxidative assays are more difficult than NAD reductive assays. In our system, we used two commercially available enzymes (ADP-dependent glucokinase and NADP-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and an NADP reductive assay, which makes our system comparatively easy to use. Moreover, the results suggest that our coupling system may be applicable for assays of various other ADP-forming kinases. Expression of the gene and purification of the recombinant enzyme Through genome sequencing, we identified a gene, ST2478 (933 bp), that was originally annotated as a putative fructokinase (a protein of 311 amino acids with a molecular weight of 34,480) in S. tokodaii. We suspected that this was the KDGK gene because ST2478 forms a cluster with the KD(P)G aldolase (ST2479) and non-phosphorylating GAP dehydrogenase (ST2477) genes, both of which are known to be situated downstream of KDGK in the modified ED pathway [8]. By contrast, fructokinase is not a constituent of the modified ED pathway. Our

suspicion was substantiated when we expressed ST2478 in E. coli cells, as we detected much more KDGK activity in the crude extract of the transformants than in that of untransformed E. coli. In addition, a strong protein band corresponding to a molecular mass of 35 kDa was detected in the crude extract using SDS­PAGE (Fig. 3, lane 2). This band was made more distinct by heating the extract (Fig. 3, lane 3), and the specific activity in the supernatant was markedly increased after the heat treatment (Table 1). This suggests that a thermostable protein in the supernatant is the recombinant KDGK produced by expression of ST2478 in the transformant E. coli. The expressed enzyme was purified about 6.3-fold with 26% recovery by heat treatment, hydrophobic chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. Subjecting the purified enzyme to SDS­ PAGE produced a single protein band (Fig. 3, lane 5). The partial amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of the purified enzyme was MAKLIT, which is identical to that obtained from the gene sequence. The molecular masses of the subunit and native molecules were determined to be 35 kDa (SDS­PAGE) and 120 kDa (gel filtration), respectively, suggesting that the enzyme is a homotetramer and thus different from the T. thermophiles enzyme, which is a 160-kDa homohexamer [15]. About 167 mg of the purified enzyme was obtained from 2 L of E. coli culture, and the specific activity of the final preparation was estimated to be 13.2 U/mg (Table 1). Characteristics of the S. tokodaii KDGK When we examined the effect of pH on KDGK activity, we found that maximum activity was obtained around pH 8.5, half the maximum activity was obtained at pHs 6.5 and 9.5, and there was no activity at pHs 4.5 and 10.0. We then determined the effect of pH on enzyme stability and detected no reductions in activity after incubation at 37 °C at pH ranging 4 to 10. When we examined the effect of temperature on KDGK activity, we observed maximum activity at 80 °C; the activity declined sharply at temperatures above 80 °C such that the activity at 90 °C was only about 25% that at 80 °C. The activity at 50 °C was about 65% of the maximum. The maximum activity for the enzyme is observed at slightly higher temperature than that (between 70 and 80 °C) for S. sulfatoricus KDGK [9]. Considering the effect of temperature on enzyme stability, we found that KDGK retained full activity after incubation at 80 °C for 1 h. About 50% of the activity remained after the incubation at 85 °C, and about 10% of the full activity

remained after incubation at 90 °C for 10 min. The S. tokodaii enzyme thus appears to be the most thermostable KDGK found so far. The specificity for the phosphoryl donor was examined using KG as the acceptor. In addition to ATP, GTP, ITP and TTP also could serve as phosphoryl donor. Relative to ATP, the activities of 2.5 mM GTP, ITP and TTP were 94%, 66%, and 43%, respectively. By contrast, UTP, CTP, ADP, GDP, IDP, UDP, CDP, and AMP were inert. Also inert as phosphoryl donors were D-glucose, D-fructose, and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate. KG was most preferable as the phosphoryl acceptor, with DG and D-gluconate showing less activity (39% and 5%, respectively, relative to KG). This enzyme also required divalent cations for activity. MgCl2 was most effective, but could be replaced with CoCl2, NiCl2, ZnCl2 or MnCl2 to some extent (Table 2). The recombinant enzyme showed typical Michaelis­ Menten type kinetics for KG, KDG, and ATP. The apparent Km values for KG and KDG at 50 °C were 1.3 ± 0.2 and 0.027 ± 0.003 mM, respectively, and the Vmax values for KG and KDG were 13.26 U/mg and 4.13 lmol/min/ mg, respectively. The turnover numbers (kcat) for KG and KDG were calculated to be 26.3 and 8.26 SÀ, respectively, and the kcat values for KG and KDG to be 20.4 and 306 mMÀSÀ, respectively. The Km values for ATP when KG and KDG served as phosphoryl acceptors were 0.11 and 0.036 mM, respectively, indicating KDG to be the more preferable substrate. Notably, the Km values for KDG with S. tokodaii KDGK are fairly low compared to the enzymes from E. coli (1.0 mM at 37 °C) [16], Thermus thermophilus (0.32 mM at 35 °C) [15], Thermoproteus tenax (0.178 mM at 70 °C) [8], and S. solfataricus (3.6 mM at 60 °C [8] and 0.14 mM at 70 °C [9]).

In this study, we succeeded in expressing the S. tokodaii ST2478 gene and identified a product exhibiting KDGK activity. The enzyme is extremely thermostable and exhibits low Km and high Vmax/Km values for KDG. It thus appears that S. tokodaii strain 7 expresses a modified (semi-phosphorylative) ED pathway as well as the nonphosphorylative ED pathway that is the main glucose metabolic pathway in other thermoacidophilic archaea such as S. solfataricas [8] and Picrophilus torridus [17]. In addition, we have already identified the genes encoding glucose dehydrogenase (ST1704) [18], gluconate dehydratase (ST2366), 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase (ST2479) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ST2477) based on the sequence similarity to the corresponding S. solfataricus genes [19], which likely comprise the modified ED pathway. We are now endeavoring to characterize the regulatory mechanisms that govern the activities of these enzymes to more fully understand the unique features of sugar metabolism in thermoacidophilic archaea.
