ABSTRACT: The adenosylcobalamin-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA by a free-radical mechanism. The recently solved X-ray crystal structure of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from Propionibacterium shermanii has shown that tyrosine 89 is an active-site residue involved in substrate binding. The role of tyrosine 89, a conserved residue among methylmalonyl-CoA mutases, has been investigated by using site-directed mutagenesis to replace this residue with phenylalanine. The crystal structure of the Tyr89Phe mutant was determined to 2.2 Å resolution and was found to be essentially superimposable on that of wild-type. Mutant and wildtype enzyme have very similar KM values, but kcat for the Tyr89Phe mutant is 580-fold lower than for wild-type. The rate of release of tritium from 5-[3H]adenosylcobalamin during the enzymatic reaction and its rate of appearance in substrate and product were measured. The tritium released was found to partition unequally between methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, in a ratio of 40:60 when the reaction was initiated by addition of methylmalonyl-CoA and in a ratio of 10:90 when the reaction was initiated by addition of succinyl-CoA. The overall release of tritium was four times faster when succinyl-CoA was used as substrate. The tritium isotope effect on the enzyme catalyzed hydrogen transfer, measured with methylmalonyl-CoA as a substrate, was kH/kT ) 30, which is within the expected range for a full primary kinetic tritium isotope effect. The different partitioning of tritium, dependent upon which substrate was used, and the normal value for the kinetic tritium isotope effect contrast markedly with the behavior of wild-type mutase. It appears that the loss of a single interaction involving the hydroxyl group of tyrosine 89 both affects the stability of radical intermediates and decreases the rate of interconversion of the substrate- and product-derived radicals.

Methylmalonyl-CoA1 mutase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA (1, 2). The protein belongs to a group of AdoCbl-dependent enzymes catalyzing unusual 1,2-rearrangements and is the only one found in both bacterial and animal cells (for reviews, see refs 3-5). The rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA follows the general reaction course of AdoCbl-dependent enzymes (Figure 1). The first step in the mutase-catalyzed reaction is the homolytic cleavage of the Co-C bond of the cofactor to generate a cob(II)alamin radical and a carbon-centered deoxyadenosyl radical (6-9). In a closely linked step which may possibly

Active-Site Mutant of Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase cofactor, to give the product succinyl-CoA (IV) and reform AdoCbl, completes the reaction cycle. The involvement of AdoCbl as the hydrogen acceptor and hydrogen donor in AdoCbl-dependent reactions has been previously demonstrated by several groups in experiments using tritium-labeled substrate and tritium-labeled cofactor (11-13). At least three specific roles have been mooted for the protein in the AdoCbl-dependent skeletal rearrangement catalyzed by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase: first, and most obviously, the remarkable enhancement of the homolytic cleavage of the carbon-cobalt bond of the enzyme-bound AdoCbl, by an estimated 1010-1011-fold (10, 14, 15) compared to free AdoCbl; second, the effective protection of the free-radical intermediates; and third, direct catalysis of the rearrangement step itself. The recent determination of the X-ray crystal structure of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from P. shermanii, both in the presence (16) and in the absence (17) of substrates or substrate analogues, has provided clear evidence that the binding of CoA ester substrates involves a major conformational change in which the binding energy is apparently used to drive the closure of the active site and the displacement of the adenosyl group from the corrin. As in the methylcobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (18, 19), the other axial ligand is provided by a histidine residue hydrogen bonded to an aspartic acid (16), but there is an unprecedentedly long Co-N bond in the mutase-bound AdoCbl, which may additionally contribute to the labilization of the axial Co-C bond (16). The crystal structure of the mutase also provided support for a role of the enzyme, in the protection of radical intermediates during the rearrangement. The conformational change upon substrate binding creates a sealed and deeply buried active-site environment shielding intermediates from solvent. Little information, however, is available concerning the extent to which active-site amino acids are directly involved in catalysis of the radical rearrangement, rather than providing a chemically inert environment (20). The crystal structure of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase revealed that only a few polar active-site amino acids, in particular histidine 244, arginine 207, and tyrosine 89, are in direct contact with the substrate (16). We focused on tyrosine 89 since tyrosine-based protein radicals have been found to play an important role in catalysis by a number of radical enzymes including ribonucleotide reductase, prostaglandin H synthase, cytochrome c oxidase, and photosystem II (for review, see refs 21 and 22). To investigate its role in catalysis by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, we have substituted tyrosine 89, which is a wholly conserved residue in methylmalonyl-CoA mutases, from various sources. The mutant Tyr89Phe was characterized in several ways: first, by determination of its crystal structure; second, by determination of its steady-state parameters; third, by measurement of kinetic deuterium isotope effects; and finally, by studying the rate of tritium release, under various conditions, from 5-[3H]adenosylcobalamin bound to the mutant enzyme. The structural effects of the mutant were found to be entirely localized to the active site, and the effects found on catalysis are consistent with tyrosine 89 playing a key role in both the stabilization of free-radical intermediates and the enhancement of their rates of interconversion.

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 41, 1998 14387 MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. The purification of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from recombinant Escherichia coli strains has been described previously (23), and the Tyr89Phe mutant protein behaved identically to the wild-type during purification. Radiolabeled 5-[3H]AdoCbl with a specific activity of 12 000 dpm/nmol was added to the Tyr89Phe mutant apoenzyme before the final purification step, and Tyr89Phe mutant methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was eluted as holoenzyme. Enzymic synthesis and purification of 5-[3H]AdoCbl was done as described by Marsh (24). The synthesis of [2H4]succinyl-CoA was as described by Simon and Shemin (25). Succinylcarbadethia-coenzyme A (26) was synthesized as described previously (7). All other chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Construction of the Tyr89Phe Mutant. Tyrosine 89 on the R-subunit of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, the structural gene for which is designated mutB, was mutated to phenylalanine using a PCR-based mega-priming approach (27). PCR was performed on a Robocycler 40 (Stratagene) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). A 2.3 kb BstEII fragment was identified as the smallest unique restriction fragment in the expression plasmid pMEX2 (23) that harbored the codon for tyrosine 89. First, a 300 bp PCR fragment extending from the 5-end of the BstEII fragment (5-CTG CTC CTC GGC GGT CAC CAC ATA-3) to the desired mutation on the 3-end (5-ATT CGC CAG TTC GCC GTt TCT CCA-3) was generated using the two primers (100 pmol), plasmid pMEX2 (100 ng), dNTPs (250 nmol), and 5U Pfu DNA polymerase in a total volume of 100 µL and 25 cycles each of 95 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and then 72 °C for 150 s, including a hot start. The mutagenic BstEII fragment was assembled using primer 5-CCC GAA GAA GCT TGG TTA CCC CGG CG-3 (100 pmol) comprising the 3-end of the BstEII fragment and the megapriming fragment (100 pmol) comprising the 5-end of the BstEII fragment. The cycling was initiated using a long first annealing cycle (95 °C for 0.45 s, 48 for 150 s and 72 °C for 180 s) including a hot start. This was followed by 24 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 51 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 150 s. The reactions were carried out in the presence of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. The mutant BstEII fragment was completely sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutation had occurred and was subsequently subcloned into pMEX-2 to obtain plasmid pMEX-Y89F. Crystallization of the Tyr89Phe Mutant. Crystals of the complex between the Tyr89Phe holomutase and the alternative substrate succinylcarbadethia-CoA were grown by vapor diffusion at 23 °C. A 10 µL hanging drop consisting of equal volumes of reservoir and protein solution was equilibrated against the reservoir solution. The protein solution consisted of 20 mg/mL mutase protein, 100 µM AdoCbl, 4 mM succinylcarbadethia-CoA, 14% w/v poly(ethylene glycol) 4000, and 20% v/v glycerol in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5; the reservoir solution 14% w/v poly(ethylene glycol) 4000 and 20% v/v glycerol in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The crystal used for data collection was monoclinic, spacegroup P21 with cell parameters a ) 120.2 Å, b ) 161.9 Å, c ) 88.7 Å, and ) 104.9°.

14388 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 41, 1998 Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement. A 98% complete data set to 2.2 Å resolution consisting of 171 783 unique reflections was collected on the X-ray diffraction beamline at Elettra, Trieste, Italy, at a wavelength of 1.24 Å (10 keV). The crystal was suspended directly from the hanging drop in a thin film of liquid and frozen at 95K in the cold stream with a 600 Series Cryostream Cooler (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, U.K.) and kept in the dark during the data collection. Data were collected in two passes with different exposure times with a 180 mm diameter MAR research image plate (Hamburg, Germany) and integrated with MOSFLM. Scaling and processing were performed using the CCP4 suite programs (Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4, 1994); data was merged with Rmerge of 0.05 with multiplicity 3.3, I/ 13.4 (2.2 in the outer shell, 2.3 to 2.2 Å); and the B-factor derived from the Wilson plot was 38 Å2. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using one R heterodimer from a previously determined structure of an inhibitor complex with 3-carboxypropyl-CoA (P. R. Evans, unpublished material). Calculations were carried out at 4 Å resolution using the program AMoRe (28). Two heterodimeric molecules were found in the asymmetric unit, in a very similar arrangement to that seen in the desulfoCoA complex (16). The molecular replacement solution after rigid body refinement at 4 Å resolution had a correlation coefficient of 78.7% and an R-factor of 29%. The model was refined using REFMAC (29) and rebuilt using the program O (30). Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to keep the two molecules in the asymmetric unit in a similar conformation. The model has an R-factor of 25% for 95% of the data to 2.2 Å resolution, with an Rfree for the remaining 5% of 29.8%. UV/Vis Spectrophotometry. UV/vis spectra were measured at 30 °C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, using a Varian Cary 1E spectrophotometer. Enzyme concentration was determined assuming 1 mol of bound AdoCbl/heterodimer, and extinction coefficients for bound AdoCbl (525 nm) ) 8000 cm-1 M -1, (336 nm) ) 11 000 cm-1 M -1, and (376 nm) ) 12 800 cm-1 M-1 (31). Steady-State Kinetic Measurements. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was assayed using a coupled enzyme spectrophotometric assay (32, 33). The steady-state kinetic parameters KM and kcat for wild-type enzyme and for Tyr89Phe mutant were determined by measuring initial velocities at various concentrations of succinyl-CoA and fitting the data to linear Hanes plots of s against s/V (reviewed in ref 34). The deuterium isotope effect on Vmax was measured under noncompetitive conditions using an initial substrate concentration of 2 mM for both succinyl-CoA and [2H4]succinylCoA. HPLC-Based Assay for Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase TurnoVer. To a solution of 1.8 mM Tyr89Phe mutant enzyme containing [3H]AdoCbl (12 000 dpm/nmol) in 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, at 30 °C, was added CoA-ester substrate to a final concentration of 1 mM. Samples (100 µL) were withdrawn after various periods of time and quenched by addition of 100 mL of 0.5% trifluoracetic acid. The samples were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -20 °C before HPLC analysis. All reactions were carried out in black Eppendorf tubes to avoid photolysis of the cobalamin.

Thoma et al. ¨ HPLC Analysis of Radiolabeled Substrates and Products. Methylmalonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and AdoCbl were separated at 10 °C by HPLC on a reversed-phase column (Pharmacia µRPC C2/C18, 2.1 × 100 mm) attached to a SMART system (Pharmacia). Samples of 100 µL were injected onto the column, which had been preequilibrated with 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, and the compounds were eluted with a linear gradient of increasing methanol concentration. Methylmalonyl-CoA eluted at 34%, succinylCoA at 36%, and AdoCbl at 50% methanol. The flow rate was 100 µL/min, and compounds were detected by monitoring the absorbance simultaneously at 256, 280, and 520 nm. The simultaneous measurement at 256, 280, and 520 nm allowed the turnover to be calculated directly from the UV trace at 280 nm, and avoided the need for 14C-labeled substrate. The recovery of radiolabeled substrates was determined with standard samples and found to be >95%. Scintillation Counting. Scintillation counting was done on a Beckman LS3801 instrument using OptiPhase HiSafe scintillation liquid. Pooled fractions of methylmalonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and AdoCbl were counted for tritium. A quench curve was established, and commercially available standards were used to correct for quenching of the samples. Data Calculation. To correct for pipetting errors, total radioactivity of methylmalonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and AdoCbl was normalized. The data were plotted and curves fitted using the KaleidaGraph program (Abelbeck Software). RESULTS Purification of the Tyr89Phe Mutant of MethylmalonylCoA Mutase. The mutant enzyme was purified to homogeneity from cell extracts of recombinant Escherichia coli, essentially as described for wild-type enzyme (23). The mutant bound 1 mol of AdoCbl/mole of enzyme and its UVvis absorption spectrum was identical to that of the wildtype enzyme (data not shown). Determination of the Crystal Structure of the Tyr89Phe Mutant. The Tyr89Phe mutant cocrystallized in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable alternative substrate succinylcarbadethia-CoA under conditions identical to those used for wildtype (35). A section of the electron density map around the active site is shown in Figure 2. Superimposition of the wildtype and mutant structures showed that the active sites of the two structures are essentially identical (backbone rms ) 0.02 Å) within experimental error. In the mutant structure, the hydroxyl group of the original tyrosine 89 is clearly absent and there is no water molecule in its place. However, the electron density of the aromatic ring of phenylalanine 89 is slightly broadened indicative of a small increase in mobility (Figure 2). The substrate density was modeled as an equimolar mixture of succinylcarbadethia-CoA and (2R)methylmalonycarbadethia-CoA. The conformation and the position of the methylmalonyl and succinyl moieties of the respective substrates were found to be identical with the wildtype, within experimental error. As observed for previous structures with bound substrate analogues (16, 35), there was no observable density that could safely be ascribed to the 5-deoxyadenosyl group. The corrin appears as a 5-coordinated cobalt(II) species (16).

FIGURE 3: Release of tritium from AdoCbl during the rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA. Methylmalonyl-CoA binds reversibly to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (I f II and II f I). The methylmalonyl-CoA radical (II) either abstracts tritium from the cofactor to yield [3H]methylmalonyl-CoA (V) or rearranges to the succinyl-CoA radical (III). The succinyl-CoA radical can then abstract either hydrogen or tritium from AdoCbl to give [3H]succinyl-CoA (IV) or succinyl-CoA (VI), respectively. Steps III f VI and III f IV are shown as irreversible because under the conditions used the back reaction can be neglected.

Steady-State Kinetic Analysis. Steady-state kinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined for the substrate succinyl-CoA using a coupled enzyme spectrophotometric assay. Initial rates (V) at various substrate concentrations (s) were measured for both enzymes and fitted to plots of s against s/V (34). The derived values for KM and kcat are shown in Table 1. The values obtained for the wild-type enzyme were in good agreement with previously measured values (32). Comparison of mutant with wildtype showed that the specific tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation does not significantly affect KM, but kcat is lowered about 580-fold. Deuterium Isotope Effect. The primary kinetic deuterium isotope effect on conversion of succinyl-CoA into methylmalonyl-CoA was measured using a range of concentrations of, separately, succinyl-CoA, and [2H4]succinyl-CoA. Isotope effects on Vmax were obtained from plots of s against s/V (data not shown) (reviewed in ref 34). The results (Table 1) show a significantly higher kinetic deuterium isotope effect (kH/kD ) 5.2 ( 0.8) for the mutant enzyme compared to the wild-type (kH/kD ) 3.4 ( 0.5). The isotope effect measured for the wild-type enzyme was in good agreement with the ¨ isotope effect of kH/kD ) 3.5 measured previously by Wolfle et al. (36). Partitioning of Tritium. In general, the experimental arrangement used to study tritium release from [3H]AdoCbl bound to the Tyr89Phe mutant was the same as previously described for wild-type enzyme (37). The pathways for migration of tritium during the course of the rearrangement are shown in Figure 3. The results of tritium partitioning

when methylmalonyl-CoA was used as a substrate are as shown in Figure 4A. Tritium was released from AdoCbl with a first-order rate constant of kTM ) 0.003 78 s-1. The distribution of tritium between the two CoA-esters was 40: 60 in favor of succinyl-CoA, and this ratio did not change within the first 240 s of the reaction. The experiment was repeated using succinyl-CoA as a substrate, and the results were as shown in Figure 4B. Tritium was released from AdoCbl with a first-order rate constant of kTS ) 0.0133 s-1, that is, about four times faster than when methylmalonylCoA is the substrate. In this experiment, the distribution of the released tritium was 90:10 in favor of succinyl-CoA over methylmalonyl-CoA. This ratio also remained constant within the first 240 ms. Tritium Isotope Effect. The conversion of methylmalonylCoA into succinyl-CoA by the Tyr89Phe mutant enzyme was monitored by integrating the respective areas under the peaks of absorbance for each CoA ester (at 280 nm) after HPLC separation. Turnover was linear for the first 240 s and the calculated turnover number for the mutant enzyme was kH ) 0.133 s-1 (Figure 4C). From the partitioning experiments shown in Figure 5A, it is clear that only 60% of the tritium released from the AdoCbl coenzyme goes into the product succinyl-CoA. The release of tritium in the forward direction was therefore calculated as kT ) 0.6kTM ) 0.0023 s-1. Assuming a rapid rotation of the methyl group of enzymebound deoxyadenosine (38), a statistical factor of 2 had to be taken into consideration. The calculated isotope effect is therefore kH/(2kT) ) 30.

DISCUSSION The mutant enzyme produced by specific substitution of tyrosine 89 in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase by phenylalanine could be purified to homogeneity by the same method as used for wild-type, demonstrating that it retains high affinity for AdoCbl. The X-ray crystal structure of the mutant protein, determined to 2.2 Å resolution, was found to be essentially superimposable on that of wild-type, so that the observed functional differences between mutant and wildtype can be ascribed with reasonable confidence to the effects

of the loss of the phenolic hydroxyl group. The Tyr89Phe mutant remains catalytically active, showing that this residue is not absolutely essential for catalysis and that it does not serve as the site of a protein-based free radical during catalysis. This is in agreement with previous kinetic data that showed the intervention of such a radical was highly unlikely (37). Nevertheless, although KM for succinyl-CoA is essentially unchanged, kcat and kcat/KM are lower by 580and 380-fold, respectively, for the Tyr89Phe mutant, compared to wild-type, consistent with the loss of an interaction that stabilizes the transition state for the catalyzed reaction, rather than an effect on substrate binding. The kinetic deuterium isotope effect (Table 1) on conversion of succinylCoA into methylmalonyl-CoA was also measured and was found to be significantly greater in the mutant (VH/VD ) 5.2 ( 0.8) than in wild-type enzyme (VH/VD ) 3.4 ( 0.5), suggesting that the mutation has altered the energetics of catalysis so that the isotope-sensitive steps of hydrogen transfer (interconversion of EM and EM,, interconversion of ES and ES,, Figure 1) are contributing relatively more to overall rate limitation than in the wild-type (39). A more detailed analysis of the primary kinetic deuterium isotope effect on Vmax alone is not yet possible, since the observed deuterium isotope contains contributions from at least two steps, hydrogen transfer from substrate to coenzyme (10), and hydrogen transfer from coenzyme to the product radical. To analyze in more detail this apparent change in the energetics of the catalyzed reaction, we have studied the kinetics of release of tritium from AdoCbl during the reaction catalyzed by the Tyr89Phe methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and the partitioning of the released isotope between methylma-

Active-Site Mutant of Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase lonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. In wild-type mutase tritium partitions identically, 75:25 in favor of succinyl-CoA over methylmalonyl-CoA, irrespective of which CoA ester is used to initiate the reaction, under conditions where the reverse reaction can be neglected (37). This indicates that, in wildtype mutase, the species EM, and ES, must be in rapid equilibrium with each other, as shown in Figure 5 (panels a and b), so that they are kinetically indistinguishable. This is not true for the Tyr89Phe mutant, where the partitioning ratio was found to differ depending on the CoA ester used as the substrate. When methylmalonyl-CoA was used as a substrate, the tritium released from AdoCbl was found to partition 60:40 in favor of succinyl-CoA, that is, rather less in favor of the product than with wild-type enzyme. When succinyl-CoA was used, the alteration in the partitioning ratio was also rather less in favor of the product, with only some 10% of the tritium released being found in methylmalonylCoA and 90% being found in succinyl-CoA. The dependence of the partitioning ratio upon the substrate used to initiate tritium release demonstrates that the species EM, and ES, are in this case clearly kinetically distinguishable: it appears that, as shown in Figure 5 (panels c and d), the rate of interconversion of the free radical species EM, and ES, has been sufficiently decreased by the loss of the interaction with the hydroxyl of tyrosine 89 that in each case the percentage of tritium found in the substrate is larger than in wild-type. Further insight into the altered energetics in the Tyr89Phe mutant was obtained by measurement of the kinetic isotope effect for tritium release from AdoCbl. For wild-type enzyme, with methylmalonyl-CoA as substrate, the primary kinetic isotope effect was determined as kH/kT ) 4.9 (37), which is considerably smaller than a normal primary tritium kinetic isotope effect, which lies in the range kH/kT ) 2030 (39). This suppressed effect was taken to mean that the energetics of the wild-type mutase are balanced, with steps other than hydrogen transfer (such as product release, breakage of the cobalt-carbon bond) contributing to overall rate limitation (37). In contrast, for the mutant enzyme, the tritium isotope effect, with methylmalonyl-CoA as substrate, was found to be kH/kT ) 30. This full isotope effect clearly indicates that, in the Tyr89Phe mutant, not only the interconversion of the radical species EM, and ES, but also the hydrogen-transfer steps are much slower than those in the wild-type. A qualitative free-energy profile representing all the kinetic data obtained in this study is shown in Figure 6b, where it is compared with the free-energy profile previously deduced for the wild-type enzyme (Figure 6a). The tritium effects are shown for clarity as effects on the transition state, although they actually affect the ground state. An important difference between the two profiles is that, for the mutant step 3, the interconversion of EM, and ES, is a significant step. This accounts for the different partitioning ratios arising from tritium release when different substrates are used. Step 3 (Figure 6b) is shown as comparable to steps 2 and 4, since all three are probably much slower than steps 1 and 5, as shown by the full tritium isotope effect found for release of tritium from AdoCbl with methylmalonyl-CoA as substrate and, yet, the primary kinetic deuterium isotope effect (which affects steps 2 and 4 only) is partly suppressed, as would be expected if step 3 is also slow.

In the absence of further quantitative data, the absolute free energy values are chosen arbitrarily. The plain line represents the energy profile for hydrogen, whereas the dashed line is a superimposed energy profile for tritium.

for the mutase-catalyzed reaction is 1:20 in favor of succinylCoA (32), and the profile is also drawn to reflect the fact that tritium release when succinyl-CoA is used as substrate is 4 times faster than when methylmalonyl-CoA is used (step 4 has a lower barrier than step 2). The energy minima of the bound substrates are set at the same level, an assumption which is supported by the crystal structure showing approximately equal electron density for both substrates. In the absence of further data, the radical intermediates EM, and ES, are arbitrarily set at the same level. The X-ray crystal structure of wild-type mutase in the absence of substrate (17) shows that the aromatic ring of tyrosine 89 is stacked closely against the adenine ring of the AdoCbl. Comparison with structures of the mutase containing substrate or substrate analogues is hindered by the fact that in the latter complexes the adenosyl moiety has not been localized, but it appears that upon substrate binding, the side chain of tyrosine 89 is moved closer to the cobalamin, displacing the adenosyl group (17). The loss of the hydroxyl group (Figure 7B), which in the wild-type

FIGURE 7: Schematic drawing of the active site of wild-type (A) and the Tyr89Phe mutant of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (B). The two substrate-derived radicals are indicated by a dot (b).

(Figure 7A) appears to be involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions with substrate, a side chain of the corrin ring, and the protein (relayed via a water molecule), would be predicted to have little effect on initial substrate-induced cobalt-carbon bond cleavage. However, if this interaction served to anchor the adenosyl group and/or the substrate in an optimal conformation for hydrogen transfer, its loss in the mutant would be expected to slow steps 2 and 4, as is observed. In addition, however, it is clear that the interconversion of the radical intermediates EM, and ES, is significantly affected by the loss of this interaction. Both associative (see, e.g., ref 40) and dissociative (41) mechanisms have been proposed for this interconversion, and the experiments in this paper do not distinguish between them. Apparently, differential stabilization of one or more transition states between EM, and ES, is achieved by specific hydrogen bonding to tyrosine 89. Taken together, these results furnish the first evidence that such specific effects are exerted by side chains at the active site of AdoCbl-dependent mutases.
