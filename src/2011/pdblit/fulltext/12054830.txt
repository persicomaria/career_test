Core Structure of the Outer Membrane Lipoprotein Ê from Escherichia coli at 1.9 A Resolution
Wei Shu, Jie Liu, Hong Ji and Min Lu*
Department of Biochemistry Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York NY 10021, USA The outer membrane lipoprotein of the Escherichia coli cell envelope has characteristic lipid modi®cations at an amino-terminal cysteine and can exist in a form bound covalently to the peptidoglycan through a carboxyl-terminal lysine. The 56-residue polypeptide moiety of the lipoprotein, designated Lpp-56, folds into a stable, trimeric helical structure in Ê aqueous solution. The 1.9 A resolution crystal structure of Lpp-56 comprises a parallel three-stranded coiled coil including a novel alaninezipper unit and two helix-capping motifs. The amino-terminal motif forms a hydrogen-bonding network anchoring an umbrella-shaped fold. The carboxyl-terminal motif uses puckering of the tyrosine side-chains as a unique docking arrangement in helix termination. The structure provides an explanation for assembly and insertion of the lipoprotein molecules into the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and suggests a molecular target for antibacterial drug discovery.

Introduction
The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is a complex structure composed of phospholipids, proteins, and polysaccharides that controls the permeability and helps maintain the shape and rigidity of the cell (for reviews, see Braun, 1975; DiRienzo et al., 1978). The protein complement of the outer membrane includes a lipoprotein that is one of the most abundant proteins in bacteria: there are about 7.2 Â 105 molecules per cell. A lipoprotein from the Escherichia coli cell envelope is initially produced as a precursor prolipoprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into a 20 residue signal peptide and a 58 residue mature protein (reviewed by Braun, 1975). At the newly generated amino terminus of the protein is an unusual amino acid, glycerylcysteine, to which two fatty acids are covalently connected via ester linkages, and one fatty acid via an amide linkage (Figure 1(a)); (Braun, 1975). The lipoprotein exists in the outer membrane in two different forms, free and bound; roughly twice as much of the free form is found as of the bound form (Braun & Sieglin, 1970; Inouye et al., 1972; Bosch & Braun, 1973; Lee & Inouye, 1974) The latter is covalently linked by the e-amino group of the carboxyl-terminal lysine to the

periplasmic peptidoglycan network (Figure 1(a)). E. coli mutants lacking the lipoprotein spontaneously form blebs on their surface and leak periplasmic enzymes into the growth medium (Hirota et al., 1977). Thus, the lipoprotein is likely to play a crucial role in the architecture and function of the outer membrane. The protein moiety of the lipoprotein contains a 4,3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat, a sequence motif suggestive of coiled-coil structures (Hodges et al., 1972; Conway & Parry, 1990, 1991; Cohen & Parry, 1990). Puri®ed free lipoprotein has a high a-helical content (Braun, 1973; Braun et al., 1976). Two models have been proposed to account for the interaction between the lipoprotein and the outer membrane. One model postulates that the three fatty acids attached to the amino terminus of the lipoprotein insert into the lipid bilayer of the outer membrane (Braun, 1973; Bosch & Braun, 1973). The other model assumes that the six lipoprotein helices form a superhelical tubular structure with a polar channel in its interior and nonpolar lining that spans the membrane (Inouye, 1974). In this model, two out of six lipoprotein molecules are covalently linked to the peptidoglycan. However, there is no convincing evidence that the lipoprotein penetrates signi®cantly into the outer membrane. The particular properties and speci®c structural requirements that enable the lipoprotein to assemble in the E. coli envelope are not known.

In our current study, we produced a recombinant protein corresponding to the polypeptide chain of the E. coli lipoprotein. This 56 residue polypeptide (referred to as Lpp-56) forms a highly helical, trimeric structure in aqueous solution under physiological conditions. The Lpp-56 trimer is of high thermodynamic stability, with a ÁG value of À20.5 kcal mol-trimerÀ1 at 25  C. Lpp-56 was crystallized, and its X-ray structure was deterÊ mined at 1.9 A resolution. The crystal structure consists of a central parallel three-stranded coiled coil containing an unconventional alanine-zipper segment, a unique amino-terminal helix-capping motif, and a novel carboxyl-terminal helix-termination motif. Implications of this structure for bacterial lipoprotein assembly and its inhibition are discussed.

Results
Stable a -helical trimer To characterize the biophysical and structural properties of the E. coli outer membrane lipoprotein, we constructed a recombinant model for the protein moiety of the molecule (Figure 1(a)). This model consists of residues 2 to 57, corresponding

to the polypeptide chain lacking the amino-terminal cysteine and carboxyl-terminal lysine, since these residues are covalently linked to lipids and the peptidoglycan layer, respectively. This recombinant model, named Lpp-56 for its length in residues, was expressed in E. coli and puri®ed as described in Materials and Methods. The sequence of Lpp-56 contains an uninterrupted 4-3 repeat of hydrophobic amino acid residues typical of a-helical coiled coils (Inouye, 1974) (see Figure 2(a)). On the basis of circular dichroism measurements in neutral pH phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4  C and 10 mM protein concentration, Lpp-56 contains more than 90 % a-helical structure (Figure 2(b); Table 1). Under these conditions, Lpp-56 melts cooperatively and reversibly with a melting temperature (Tm) of 67  C (Figure 2(b); Table 1). Sedimentation equilibrium measurements indicate that Lpp-56 sediments as a clean trimer over a tenfold range of protein concentrations (50 to 500 mM) (Figure 2(d); Table 1). The conformational stability of Lpp-56 was measured quantitatively using guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) denaturation, monitoring the state of the protein by CD. The linear extrapolation method was used to evaluate the free energy change (ÁG ) for the unfolding of the Lpp-56 trimer (Pace, 1986;

The random distributions of the residuals indicate that the data ®t well to an ideal single-species model. The slope of the plotted data indicates that Lpp56 is trimeric in solution. The calculated data for dimeric and tetrameric models are indicated by dashed and solid lines, respectively.

The GdmCl denaturation curve of Lpp-56 in the limit of zero concentration of the denaturant yields an apparent ÁG of À20.5 kcal mol-trimerÀ1 with a m value of 2.8 kcal mol-trimerÀ1 MÀ1 (Figure 2(c)). Thus, the recombinant Lpp-56 model forms a highly thermostable, three-stranded a-helical bundle. Structure determination and overview To gain a structural insight into the assembly of the lipoprotein, we determined the X-ray crystal Ê structure of Lpp-56 at 1.9 A resolution. Crystal density calculations (Matthews, 1968) indicate that the crystals contain one Lpp-56 monomer in the asymmetric unit; each monomer is related by a crystallographic 3-fold axis. The structure was solved by a molecular replacement approach using Ê the 1.8 A structure of a GCN4 isoleucine zipper (Harbury et al., 1994), with all side-chains truncated to an alanine residue except those at the a and d heptad positions, as a search model. One molecule of Lpp-56 was located (correlation coef®cient  40.0 %) in the asymmetric unit of the crystal after the ®tting procedure in the molecular replacement package AMoRe (Navaza, 1994).

Rigid body re®nement of this molecule resulted in an R-factor of 50.1 % in the resolution shell 6.0 to Ê 3.0 A. An initial model corresponding to one monomer was built by iterative rounds of electron density map interpretation, simulated annealing, energy minimization, and restrained B-factor re®nement. The structure has been re®ned to a conventional R-factor of 21.4 % and a free R-factor Ê of 26.9 % for data in the 15.0 to 1.9 A resolution range. The ®nal 2Fo À Fc electron density map is of good quality (Figure 3(a)) and reveals the positions of all amino-acid residues except for a few disordered side-chains at the carboxyl terminus and on the protein surface. The crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 2. As expected, three Lpp-56 molecules associate to form a homotrimer. The Lpp-56 trimer creates a Ê cylinder $83 A in length with circular cross-section Ê . It is composed of three domains: (1) a of 21± 24 A long central three-stranded coiled-coil domain consisting of three parallel a helices wrapped in a gradual left-handed superhelix with 3-fold axis of symmetry; (2) an amino-terminal capping motif that forms a well-de®ned network of multi-center hydrogen bonds, with an umbrella-shaped fold; and (3) a novel hydrophobic helix-termination

motif in which the aromatic rings of the carboxylterminal tyrosine residues interact with a 3-fold axis of symmetry. Structure of the coiled-coil domain In trimeric coiled-coil sequences, leucine or the b-branched residues valine and isoleucine are approximately equally represented and distributed evenly at positions a and d (Conway & Parry, 1991). This pattern underlies the basis for a similar placement of atoms around the side-chains in the a

and d layers (e.g. Harbury et al., 1994). However, in contrast, Lpp-56 has predominantly b-branched residues (Ile7, Val14, Val21, Val28, Val35, Ala42, Leu49) at the a position and non-b-branched residues (Leu10, Leu17, Leu24, Met31, Ala38, Ala45, Met52) at the d position (Figure 2(a)). It is interesting that the composition of three successive a and d layers includes alanine residues (Ala38, Ala42, Ala45) (Figure 2(a)). A sequence comparison of the lipoprotein from four enteric bacteria shows that all the core alanine residues are invariant (Figure 1(b)).

1105 into-holes packing, in which the a and d sidechains (knobs) ®t into the diamonds (holes) between four residues on the neighboring helices (Crick, 1953). It is surprising that the alanine methyl group adopts an acute packing geometry characteristic of trimeric coiled coils, with the CaCb bond of each alanine knob making an $60  angle with respect to the Ca-Cavector at the base of the recipient (Harbury et al., 1993, 1994). The three Ala42 side-chains at the a position (Figure 4(a)), for example, pack into the trimer core, in the analogous fashion to the a-layer leucine side-chains (Figure 4(b)). Thus, the helix packing geometry in the three alanine-zipper layers is very similar to that seen in conventional three-stranded coiled coils. The alanine-zipper region in the Lpp-56 structure extends from Val35 to Gln47. The radius of this region, de®ned as the average distance between the individual helical axes and the superÊ helical axis by Crick (1953), is 5.2 A (Table 3). By contrast, the supercoil radius of regular trimeric Ê coiled coils is 6.7 A (Table 3). The decrease in the radius correlates with the smaller alanine side chain-packing volume (Figure 4(a) and (b)). As a result, Lpp-56 exhibits a unique a-helical curvature (Figure 3(b); Table 3). Although the pitch, radius, and residues per turn of the superhelices in the alanine-zipper segment and conventional coiled coils differ greatly, the individual a-helices are virtually identical on a local scale (Table 3). In addition, a cavity in the middle of each alanine layer forms a continuous central channel. The radius of the chanÊ nel varies from 1.4 to 1.8 A. This cavity is large Ê enough to accommodate a 1.4 A water molecule (Connolly, 1983). No electron density was seen in the channel. On the basis of distance criteria, twenty four interhelical ion pairs are present on the surface of the central trimeric coiled-coil domain. These include eighteen interhelical salt bridges between residues at the e and g positions and six interhelical

The central three-stranded coiled-coil domain of Lpp-56 includes 49 residues (5 to 53) from each polypeptide chain. The heptad repeat is maintained, in register, through the entire 49-residue region (Figure 3(b)). Residues at the a and d positions pack against each other to form a hydrophobic interface between the three helices and also pack against residues at the g and e positions, respectively, to complete the hydrophobic core (Figure 3(c) and (d)). All the core residues including three alanine residues display typical knobs-

g to b salt bridges. The Asp50 side chain at the b position, for example, bonds to the NZ atoms of Arg48H , on the adjacent helix, at the g position (2.79 Ê and 3.12 A) (Figure 4(d)). Interestingly, it appears that favorable electrostatic interactions contribute to the alanine-zipper stability. The Ala42 layer, for example, contains an interactive combination of salt bridges referred to as complex salt bridges; the Od1 atom of Asp41 at the g position forms a salt Ê bridge with the Arg44 side-chain (2.94 A) at the c position and hydrogen-bonds to the Asn46H sidechain at the eH position of the adjacent helix (2.91 Ê and 3.06 A) (Figure 4(c) and (e)). In addition, the main-chain CO group of Asp41 forms a hydrogen Ê bond with the Ne atom of Asn46H (3.10 A) (Figure 4(e)), while the Asp41 side-chain can interact with the main-chain CO groups of both Lys39H Ê (2.67 and 2.77 A) and Ala43H (2.60, 2.95, and Ê 2.69 A) as well as the NZ atom of Arg44 (2.60 and Ê 3.08 A) via water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Figure 4(e)).

Structure of the amino-terminal capping motif Figure 5 shows the hydrogen-bonding interaction in the N-terminal capping motif of Lpp-56 and the quality of the electron density map for the amino-terminal region of the molecule. Residues Ser2, Ser3, Asb4, and Asp8, which are invariant in all bacterial lipoproteins, are poised to specify a capping conformation that lies outside the coiledcoil domain. In each polypeptide chain, both the side-chain Og atom and the main-chain N of Ser-2 hydrogen-bond to the Od of Asp8 (2.50 and Ê 2.86 A); as a result, the Ser2 side-chain is oriented toward the helix axis to form a distinct aminoterminal bend characteristic of capping structures seen in proteins and peptide models (e.g. Presta & Rose, 1988; Gong et al., 1995; Lu et al., 1999b). In the crystal structure of the Lpp-56 trimer, the three single helical caps are further stabilized by a twowater-mediated bridge connecting the Ser2 Og atom and the Asn4H Ne of an adjacent helix (2.85, Ê 2.68, and 3.14 A). Thus, this hydrogen-bonding

interaction related by the 3-fold axis of symmetry is responsible for ®rmly anchoring an unconventional umbrella-shaped capping structure that straddles the amino terminus of the trimeric coiled coil. To understand how this capping interaction contributes to the stability of the Lpp-56 trimer, we mutated Ser2 of Lpp-56 to an alanine residue to generate a single-point mutant, designated Ser2Ala. Ser2 was selected because this residue appears to play a dominant role in the overall architecture of the amino-terminal hydrogen-bonding network. In addition, we truncated three residues (Ser2, Ser3, and Asn4) from the aminoterminal sequence of Lpp-56 to produce a 53-residue mutant protein, named Lpp-53. CD studies indicate that each mutant protein exists in a fully helical conformation which sedimentation equilibrium measurements indicate is trimeric in solution (Table 1). At 10 mM protein concentration in PBS (pH 7.0), the Tm`s of Ser2Ala and Lpp-53 are 64 and 60  C, respectively, as compared with 67  C for Lpp-56 (wild-type) (Table 1). GdmCl

denaturation experiments show that Ser2Ala and Lpp-53 are 0.8 and 1.7 kcal mol-trimerÀ1 less stable than wild-type, respectively (Table 1). Thus, the amino-terminal capping structure of the Lpp-56 trimer stabilizes the native state of the protein. Structure of the helix-termination motif An unexpected feature of the Lpp-56 structure is a novel helix-termination motif composed of residues 54 to 57 located in the carboxyl terminus of the coiled-coil domain. The side-chain of Tyr56 is shown clearly in the electron density (Figure 6(a)), making van der Waals contacts with a 3-fold symmetry (Figure 6(b)). The tyrosine aromatic rings are perpendicular to one another about 80  , and they incline by about 30  toward the superhelical axis. Residues 54 to 57 do not interact with the rest of the molecule; Thr54 and Lys55 are in an extended conformation, such that the Tyr56 side-chain packs Ê Ê into a large cavity ($10 A long, $10 A wide, and Ê $4-5 A deep) at the carboxyl terminus of the trimeric coiled coil (Figure 6(c)). Sequence com-

1108 parisons between four bacteria outer membrane lipoproteins show that Tyr56 is invariant, while residues 54, 55, and 57 are divergent (Figure 1(b)). Moreover, the side chains of Thr54, Lys55, and Arg-57 are not visible in our electron density map (see Materials and Methods). Therefore, we infer that irrespective of the nature of the amino acids at these positions, Tyr56 can play a distinctive structural role in maintaining a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic capping motif. To evaluate the contribution of the hydrophobic tyrosine cap to protein structure and stability, we substituted Tyr56 of Lpp56 with an alanine residue to produce a mutant protein, designated Tyr56Ala. Equilibrium sedimentation shows that Tyr56Ala forms a clean trimer (Table 1). CD experiments indicate that the folded mutant protein exhibits a >90 % a-helical structure, with a Tm of 63  C for a 10 mM solution (Table 1). Moreover, the Tyr56Ala trimer has an apparent ÁG (25  C) determined by GdmCl denaturation of À19.4 kcal mol-trimerÀ1 (m  2.6 kcal mol-trimerÀ1 MÀ1) (Table 1). This ÁG value, relative to À20.5 kcal mol-trimerÀ1 for Lpp-56, indicates that the free energy of protein stabilization associated with the hydrophobic capping interaction is 1.1 kcal mol-trimerÀ1.

al preferences with non-local factors, such as the geometric properties of the amino-acid side-chains and interstrand hydrophobic and polar contacts (e.g. Harbury et al., 1993; Zhu et al., 1993; Lovejoy et al., 1993; Gonzalez et al., 1996). The crystal strucÊ ture of the Lpp-56 trimer at 1.9 A resolution reveals for the ®rst time that the three parallel helices curve gently around each other in the alanine layers to make tight contacts, with a helix-axis Ê spacing of close to 8.9 A (Table 3). The methyl group of the core alanine residues packs ef®ciently into the center of the trimer in a classical acute knobs-into-holes fashion extending over three helical turns. This alanine-zipper structure is unexpected because previous studies have suggested that alanine, albeit a good helix-inducing residue, is unfavorable in classical coiled-coil structures (Hodges et al., 1981). Nonetheless, models for including alanine into coiled coils have been proposed. For example, the Richardson's alacoil structure with alanine in every seventh position postulated an antiparallel a-helical dimeric coiled coil, in which each alanine methyl group packs against the backbone of the opposite helix inside a triangle of three residues (Gernert et al., 1995). Helix-capping interactions The free ends of the helices in proteins and peptide models tend to fray, because the ®rst four amide groups and last four carboxyl groups cannot form normal intrahelical hydrogen bonds in a classical Pauling a helix (Presta & Rose, 1988;

1109 protein molecules. In addition, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal capping domains appear to play a role in the lipoprotein assembly; this is supported by the fact that the helix-capping residues show the highest level of conservation. Since the distance between the outer membrane and the glycan layer Ê of the peptidoglycan is $25 A (DiRienzo et al., 1978), the assembled lipoprotein structure with a Ê height of $80 A could be inserted into the outer membrane. It remains unclear how the peptidoglycan-linked lipoprotein trimer penetrates into the inner layer of the lipid bilayer of the outer membrane. Further structural studies of the lipoprotein in the membrane environment are required to address this issue. Gram-negative bacteria are enclosed by a threelayered cell envelope consisting of the inner plasma membrane, the periplasm, and the outer membrane with proteins and lipids of unique structure. Periplasmic peptidoglycan as a unique bacterial cell wall layer is the primary site of antibiotic action (Braun, 1975). Although the exact function of the lipoprotein is not well established, this abundant protein is likely to contribute to the structural rigidity of the outer membrane by forming a network linked to the peptidoglycan layer (Hirota et al., 1977). Numerous studies have led to the notion that the lipoprotein-peptidoglycan interaction is essential for the assembly of the outer membrane (Braun, 1975; DiRienzo et al., 1978; Nikaido & Vaara, 1987). Given the desperate need for new targets for antibiotics, the atomic structure of the lipoprotein suggests avenues for antibacterial drug design/discovery. For example, the highly conserved tyrosine cap in the carboxyl terminus of the lipoprotein trimer could be an attractive target for development of new small-molecule drugs.

Richardson & Richardson, 1988). In contrast, both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal termini of the Lpp-56 trimer have well-de®ned electron density in the 1.9 resolution map, allowing detailed structural analysis of capping interactions. The aminoterminal capping motif is formed by the Ser-XAsn-X-X-X-Asp sequence that folds into a unique umbrella-shaped conformation. This capping structure shields the exposed amide main chain groups of all the three helices ef®ciently via a combination of intra- and inter-strand hydrogen bonds involving the polar side-chain and main-chain atoms. This hydrogen-bonded interaction stabilizes the terminated helices and thereby the native trimeric structure by amounts ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 kcal mol-trimerÀ1. Our results demonstrate that capping interactions can also contribute appreciably to stabilizing interhelical packing in coiled coils. Surprisingly, the Lpp-56 structure contains a distinct carboxyl-terminal conformational arrangement in which an invariant tyrosine (Tyr56) forms a shielded hydrophobic core, thereby imposing substantial restriction on the conformation of each of the three helices; hence, this structure impedes propagation of each helix beyond the cap. The stability of the carboxyl-terminal capped Lpp-56 trimer increases by 1.1 kcal mol-trimerÀ1, relative to an alanine reference. This novel helix-termination motif may therefore impart structural uniqueness to protein folding and design. Our results also provide strong support for the notion that helix capping can serve as a sensitive bridge linking a-helix formation to protein tertiary structure. Implications for lipoprotein assembly The lipoprotein has characteristic covalent lipid modi®cations at its amino-terminal glycerylcysteine, whereby one third of the molecules are covalently linked by the carboxyl-terminal lysine to the periplasmic peptidoglycan (Bosch & Braun, 1973; Lee & Inouye, 1974). There are about 4.8 Â 10À1 and 2.4 Â 10À5 molecules per cell for the free and the bound forms, respectively; both forms are located almost exclusively in the outer membrane (Braun et al., 1970; Inouye et al., 1972). Our results show that the recombinant Lpp-56 model forms a three-helix bundle that is stabilized by 20.5 kcal mol-trimerÀ1 at 25  C, as determined by using GdmCl unfolding. Our crystallographic analysis reveals that Lpp-56 folds into a long parallel coiled-coil trimer with distinctive amino- and carboxyl-terminal capping structures. The protein approximates a cylinder with a diameter of 21 to Ê Ê 24 A and a length of $83 A. These biophysical and structural features, taken together with the previous considerations (reviewed by Braun, 1975; DiRienzo et al., 1978), lead us to propose a model for assembly of the lipoprotein. In this model, the trimeric lipoprotein complex is embedded in the lipid bilayer of the outer membrane via its aminoterminal lipid portion, and it is anchored to the peptidoglycan layer through one of the three lipo-

Materials and Methods
Gene construction and protein production Plasmid pLpp56, encoding the polypeptide chain (residues 2 to 57) of the E. coli lipoprotein, was constructed by PCR ampli®cation from genomic E. coli DNA, followed by subcloning into the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites of the vector pAED4 (Doering, 1992). Mutations were introduced into pLpp56 by single-stranded mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) and veri®ed by DNA sequencing. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used (Sambrook et al., 1989). All recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS using the T7 expression system (Studier et al., 1990). Cells, freshly transformed with an appropriate plasmid, were grown to late log phase. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM isopropylthio-b-D-galactoside (IPTG). After another three hours of growth at 37 or 30  C, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were lysed by glacial acetic acid as described previously (Lu et al., 1999a). Proteins were puri®ed from the soluble fraction to homogeneity by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using a Vydac C-18 preparative column and a linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1 % (v/v) tri¯uoroacetic acid. The identities of the peptides were con-

1110
®rmed by mass spectrometry (Perceptive Biosystems Voyager Elite), and all molecular weights were found to be within 2 da of the expected weight. Circular dichroism spectroscopy CD spectra were acquired at 10 mM protein concentration in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mM NaCl (PBS) with an Aviv 62 DS spectrometer as described previously (Shu et al., 1999). Helix content was estimated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm by the value expected for 100 % helix formation by helices of comparable size, À33,000 deg.cm2 dmolÀ1 (Chen et al., 1974). Thermal stability was determined by monitoring the change in CD signal at 222 nm as a function of temperature as described previously (Shu et al., 1999). Reversibility was checked by repeated scans. The midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (melting temperature, Tm) was determined from the maximum of the ®rst derivative, with respect to the reciprocal of the temperature, of the [y]222 values (Cantor & Schimmel, 1980). The error in estimation of Tm is Æ0.5  C. GdmCl denaturation experiments were performed in PBS (pH 7.0) by monitoring [y]222 as a function of GdmCl concentration. Samples were thermostated at 4  C with a built-in temperature controller. A two-state unfolding model, with a linear dependence of the estimated standard free energy difference between folded and unfolded (ÁG ) on GdmCl concentration (Pace, 1986; Santoro & Bolen, 1988), was ®tted to a monomertrimer equilibrium (Backmann et al., 1998). Sedimentation equilibrium Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge as described previously (Shu et al., 1999). Protein solutions were dialyzed overnight against PBS, loaded at initial concentrations of 50, 200, and 500 mM, and analyzed at rotor speeds at 21 and 24 krpm at 20  C. Data sets were ®tted to a single-species model (Johnson et al., 1981). Protein partial speci®c volume and solvent density were calculated with constants from Laue et al (l981). Molecular weights were all within 10 % of those calculated for an ideal trimer, with no systematic deviation of the residuals. Crystallization and structure determination Lpp-56 was crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. To grow crystals, a 10 mg mlÀ1 stock of HPLC-puri®ed Lpp-56 was diluted 1:1 with a reservoir solution and allowed to equilibrate against the reservoir solution. Primitive rhombohedral crystals of Lpp-56 were obtained from 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 30 % polyethylene glycol 4000. The crystals belong to the space Ê Ê group R32 (a  b  34.36 A, c  194.14 A, a  b  90  , g  120  ) with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. For data collection, crystals were transferred to a cryoprotected solution containing 15 % (v/v) glycerol in the corresponding mother liquor. Diffraction data were collected at 95 K using an R-axis IV image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode X-ray generator at the X-ray Crystallography Facility at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Re¯ections were integrated and scaled with the HKL suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996).

Structure of the E. coli Outer Membrane Lipoprotein

The structure of Lpp-56 was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The initial model was built by using conventional Ê (2Fo À Fc)Ècalc and (Fo À Fc)Ècalc maps at 2.5 A. Overall anisotropic B-factor and bulk solvent corrections were applied. Many cycles of torsional angle simulated È annealing and grouped B-factor re®nement (Brunger, 1992) were followed by extensive rebuilding. The resulting map revealed traceable electron density for all amino acid residues of Lpp-56. The ®nal model corresponding to one monomer was built by using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). The structure was re®ned by using È positional and B-factor re®nements (Brunger, 1992) for all data between 15.0 and 1.9 A resolution. Crystallographic re®nement of the structure was done with the È program CNS 0.5 (Brunger et al., 1998). As the re®nement proceeded, 61 waters were added. Model geometry was analyzed by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), with all residues but one (Met52) occupying most-preferred regions of the Ramanchandran space and most side-chains in common rotamers. Met52 lies in the additionally allowed region of the Ramanchandran plot. Ê The overall temperature factor of the model is 26.2 A2. Side-chains of Gln9, Lys20, Lys39, and Lys55 are disordered and were thus modeled as a serine residue, and side-chains of Thr54 and Arg57 were modeled as glycine and alanine residues, respectively. The Asp22 side chain adopts two alternative conformations. Protein Data Bank accession number The re®ned coordinates for the Lpp-56 trimer (PDB entry 1EQ7) have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank.
