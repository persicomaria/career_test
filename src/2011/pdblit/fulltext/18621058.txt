Abstract The Friend of GATA (FOG) family of proteins is an evolutionarily conserved class of large multitype zinc finger cofactors that bind to the amino zinc finger of GATA transcription factors and modulate their activity. Two FOG genes have been identified in mammals, both of which interact with each of the six known vertebrate GATA factors in vitro. Physical interaction between FOG and GATA proteins in vivo is essential for the development of a broad array of tissues, reflecting the overlapping expression patterns of these factors. In this review, we will discuss the identification and characterization of FOG proteins, their role in human disease, and recent studies that shed new light on their function and regulation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction The development of multicellular organisms requires an intricate process involving the differentiation of distinct specialized cell types from multipotent precursors. The spatial and temporal regulation of these cell fate decisions, as well as proliferation of intermediate cell populations, must be exquisitely controlled in order to generate functional organisms with high fidelity. In addition, many organisms contain a subset of tissues that undergo continual turnover, such as the blood, gastrointestinal and hair systems. This involves ongoing differentiation of specialized cell subtypes from pluripotent stem cells.

2. GATA family of transcription factors A central aim of modern developmental biology is to further understand the molecular mechanisms that control pro

liferation, cell fate outcome, and terminal maturation of cells. Prior work has shown that lineage-restricted transcription factors, working in combination with more broadly expressed factors, play key roles in these processes. One such family is the GATA class of zinc finger transcription factors (for review, see [1]). This family of proteins derives its name from the DNA consensus sequence, (T/A)GATA(A/G), to which they bind with high affinity and specificity. GATA factors are highly conserved throughout evolution with members present in fungi, flies, worms, chickens, fish, frogs, mice, and humans. They contain zinc fingers (Zfs) of the Cys-X2 Cys-X17 -Cys-X2 -Cys configuration (where X represents any amino acid), which mediate DNA binding. Most metazoan GATA factors contain two zinc fingers. The carboxyl zinc finger mediates high-affinity DNA binding, whereas as the amino zinc finger stabilizes the interaction at certain palindromic sites [2]. Six members of the GATA family have been identified in vertebrates. GATA-1, -2, and -3 are expressed predominantly within the hematopoietic system, with some expression of GATA-2 and -3 in the central nervous system. GATA-4, -5, and -6 are expressed outside of the blood system in cardiac,

gastrointestinal, gonadal and central nervous tissues. Targeted disruption of individual GATA genes in mice leads to profound developmental abnormalities. Hemizygous GATA1- male mice (GATA-1 is located on the X-chromosome) die at E10.5 of embryogenesis from severe anemia with a block in early erythroid maturation [3]. GATA-1 deficient megakaryocytes exhibit impaired maturation and marked hyperproliferation [4,5]. GATA-2-/- mice die during embryogenesis due to a failure of expansion of early hematopoietic progenitors [6]. They also fail to produce any mast cells [7]. GATA-3-/- mice have defects in T-lymphocyte development, and GATA4-/- mice die at E7.0 of gestation due to defects in heart tube formation and ventral morphogenesis [8­10]. GATA-1, the founding member of the GATA family, is perhaps the best characterized of the GATA factors. Within the hematopoietic system, its expression is restricted to the erythroid, megakaryocytic, eosinophil and mast cell lineages. In early studies of GATA-1 transcriptional activity, an amino terminal domain was found to be necessary for its ability to transactivate reporter genes in transiently transfected cells [11]. Surprisingly, this same region is completely dispensable in cellular assays of GATA-1 function based on its ability to rescue erythroid maturation of a GATA-1 deficient cell line (G1E) [12]. This suggests that regions of GATA-1 other than the amino terminal domain are involved in mediating its transcriptional activity in vivo. Although zinc fingers are classically thought to mediate protein­DNA interactions, they also participate in protein­protein interactions. Given the high degree of amino acid sequence conservation of the amino zinc fingers of metazoan GATA factors, their lack of major DNA-binding activity, and the results cited above for GATA-1, it was postulated that they may mediate important protein­protein interactions involved in GATA factor activity [12]. Based on this, we and our colleagues performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for interacting partners employing the amino zinc finger of GATA-1 as bait, and identified a novel multitype zinc finger protein that we named Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1) [13].

Zinc fingers are represented as vertical solid bars; C2HC-type, magenta; C2H2-type, blue. GATA binding zinc fingers are marked with an asterisk. The "double zinc finger" structure is indicated by bracket. "CR" refers to a region of high sequence conservation among vertebrate FOG family members.

A full-length cDNA clone is not available for xFOG. Xenopus FOG contains an additional putative zinc finger domain not found in other FOG genes, denoted by "?".

3. The Friend of GATA family of proteins 3.1. Friend of GATA-1 Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1, Zfpm1) encodes a protein of 995 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 110 kDa [13]. Murine FOG-1 contains nine putative zinc fingers (Zfs 1­9) of two types. Four of the zinc fingers are of the classical C2H2 configuration, and five are of an unusual variant C2HC type. The zinc fingers are distributed throughout the protein, either singly or in small clusters (Fig. 1). Two of the C2H2 zinc fingers, Zf 2 and Zf 3, are separated by an evolutionarily conserved H/C link motif and resemble double zinc fingers present in other developmental proteins such as Ikaros, the Drosophila melanogaster homeoprotein sal, the Caenorhabditis elegans protein SEM-4, and human PRDII-BFI [14­16].

FOG-1 also contains several proline-rich regions located in the amino terminus, between Zfs 5­6, Zfs 6­7, and Zfs 8­9. A binding motif (PIDLS) for the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) corepressor is present between Zf6 and Zf7 (see discussion below). Murine FOG-1 is expressed as early as day E8.5 in blood islands of the yolk sac and in the allantois. By the fetal stage of hematopoiesis (E12.5), FOG-1 becomes highly expressed in fetal liver, a major source of hematopoietic activity in the embryo, and to a lesser extent in the intestine and developing brain. In adult mice, FOG-1 is present in the spleen, a primary site of hematopoiesis in the mouse, as well as in the liver and testis, but not in the heart, brain, lung, kidney, or skeletal muscle. Within the hematopoietic system, FOG-1 shows restricted expression. It is present at high levels in early multipotent progenitors, erythroid and megakaryocytic cells, low levels in hematopoietic stem cells and lymphoid cells, and is absent from macrophages, eosinophils, and mast cells. This expression pattern overlaps GATA-1 both temporally and spatially, but does not mirror it completely. FOG-1-/- mice die between E10.5 and 12.5 of gestation from severe anemia [17]. They exhibit a block in erythroid maturation at a stage similar to that observed in GATA-1- mice, providing genetic evidence that FOG-1 and GATA-1 function in a coordinate manner in erythroid development [3]. In contrast to GATA-1 deficient mice, FOG-1-/- animals exhibit a complete failure of megakaryopoiesis, suggesting a possible GATA-1 independent role of FOG-1 in early megakaryopoiesis. However, this discrepancy is explained by compensatory FOG-dependent roles of GATA-1 and GATA2 in early megakaryopoiesis [18]. FOG-1 is also involved in T lymphocyte development in mice [19]. Absence of FOG-1

leads to a developmental arrest in thymocytes with inefficient generation of mature CD4+ T cells. 3.2. FOG-2 Soon after the identification of FOG-1, searches of the murine expressed sequence tag (EST) databases revealed the presence of a second FOG-related gene [20­22]. The cDNA for this gene was isolated and named FOG-2 (Zfpm2). FOG2 is slightly larger than FOG-1, encoding a protein of 1151 amino acids and Mr of 128 kDa (Fig. 1). It contains eight zinc fingers, four of the C2HC type and four of the C2H2 type. Comparison to the structure of FOG-1 reveals that FOG-2 lacks the equivalent of Zf8 of FOG-1. Most of the sequence homology between FOG-1 and FOG-2 occurs within the zinc fingers. However, there is conservation of the CtBP-binding motif, as well as a unique region located between Zfs 4 and 5 of unknown function. FOG-2 is expressed as early as E9.5 during mouse embryogenesis. Initial expression is predominantly within the septum transversum surrounding the developing hepatic primordium and within undifferentiated mesenchyme surrounding the developing foregut. At this stage, low-level expression is present in cardiac myocytes of the ventricle and bulbus cordis, while very little expression is apparent in the neuroepithelium. As the embryos develop, expression in the remnants of the septum foregut persists, while ex-

pression within the heart increases. Although cardiomyocytes of both the ventricle and atria express FOG-2, over time there is greater expression in the ventricle. As the embryos develop to E13.5­15.5, expression within the heart diminishes, whereas expression within the central nervous system increases, predominantly in the basal ganglia, hypothalamus, tegmentum, telencephalon and pons. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues demonstrates expression in heart, brain and testis, and low-level expression in liver and lung. Thus, for the most part, FOG-2 expression does not overlap with that of FOG-1. Whereas FOG-1 is expressed predominantly within the hematopoietic system, FOG-2 is expressed outside of blood, mostly in heart, brain, gonads, and liver. This expression pattern mirrors that of GATA-4/-5/-6, suggesting that FOG-2 may serve as a cofactor for these non-hematopoietic GATA factors. Indeed, subsequent studies support this view (see below). The expression patterns of FOG-1 and FOG-2 are summarized in Table 1. Like FOG-1, knock-out of the FOG-2 gene in mice is embryonic lethal [23,24]. FOG-2-/- mice die at between E12.5 and 15.5 due to a complex congenital cardiac defect consisting of thinned ventricular myocardium, common atrioventricular canal, and the tetralogy of Fallot malformation seen in humans. There is also a cell non-autonomous defect in coronary vessel formation, and abnormalities of gonadal development [25].

3.3. Human FOG proteins Two human FOG genes have been identified. One gene, located on chromosome 16q24, most closely resembles murine FOG-1 in sequence and expression pattern [26] (Table 1). The other, located on chromosome 8q23, is structurally homologous to murine FOG-2 [27]. In adult tissues, it is expressed predominantly in brain, heart and skeletal muscle, and to a lower extent in lung.

4.2. Xenopus FOG A single FOG gene has been identified in xenopus [30]. Its structure reflects a hybrid between that of mammalian FOG-1 and FOG-2, although it more closely resembles FOG-1. Likewise, its expression pattern encompasses those of both mammalian FOG-1 and FOG-2, including hematopoietic, cardiac, and neural tissues. 4.3. Zebrafish FOG

4. Non-mammalian FOG genes 4.1. U-shaped Co-incident with the discovery of FOG-1 in mammalian systems, a structurally related protein, U-shaped (ush), was independently identified in Drosophila melanogaster [28,29]. Drosophila contains large sensory bristles called macrochaetes located on the notum. Each bristle structure develops from a single sensory mother cell (SMC) located in the imaginal disc. The competence to become a SMC is conferred by a group of cells located at defined positions within the imaginal disc. These cells are characterized by the expression of the proneural genes achaete (ac) and scute (sc), which are members of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors. Loss-of-function ac and sc mutants display absent bristles on the thorax, whereas ectopic expression of these genes leads to additional or ectopic bristle formation. Expression of ac and sc is controlled in part by the expression of pannier (pnr), a GATA related molecule. Hypomorphic mutants of pnr exhibit loss of sensory bristles, coincident with loss of ac and sc expression, and ectopic expression leads to the development of additional bristles. pnr contains two zinc fingers, which exhibit high sequence homology to the zinc fingers of mammalian GATA factors. Certain mutations within the amino zinc finger are found in a class of pnr mutants (pnrD ) which display enhanced bristle formation, suggesting that they may disrupt binding to a putative suppressor molecule. In a second-site modifier screen for suppressors of the pnrD phenotype, Haenlin and his colleagues identified loss-of-function mutations in ush, a gene previously identified in a large-scale genetic screen. Molecular cloning of this gene revealed that it encodes a single open reading frame of 1191 amino acids, with a relative molecular mass of 123 kD. It is predicted to contain nine zinc fingers, five of the C2HC type and four of the C2H2, distributed throughout the molecule and in certain clusters (Fig. 1). Overall, ush has about 20% sequence identity with murine FOG-1 and FOG-2, although there is much greater sequence conservation within the zinc finger domains. Like the murine members of this family, ush also contains a binding motif for CtBP, though of slightly different sequence (PLDLS) and relative location compared to the murine FOG proteins.

Three distinct FOG genes have been identified in zebrafish (B.H. Paw, personal communication). The gene most resembling FOG-1 in sequence is expressed in a broad array of tissues including hematopoietic, gut, heart, and specific structures within the brain. The remaining two FOG genes, which more closely resemble murine FOG-2 in sequence, show a more restricted pattern of expression, largely within the nervous system. Thus, FOG proteins represent a conserved family of related genes that appear to have arisen at a relatively early stage in the evolution of multicellular organisms, coincident with the development of two-zinc finger containing GATA proteins. Phylogenic analysis suggests that a gene duplication event occurred before the divergence of fish and tetrapods, leading to the diversification of FOG genes into the FOG-1 and FOG-2 subtypes (Fig. 2).

5. FOG­GATA physical interactions 5.1. GATA factor interacting domains In order to begin to examine the functional significance of interactions between FOG and GATA protein, we and our colleagues performed an altered specificity mutation screen of the amino zinc finger of GATA-1 to identify point mutations that disrupt binding to FOG-1 [31,32]. The cDNA encoding the amino zinc finger of GATA-1 was randomly mutated and tested for its interaction with FOG-1 zinc fin-

Paw).

gers 5 and 6 in a reverse two-hybrid yeast genetic approach. In this system, yeast clones grow only if the bait and prey molecules fail to interact. Several mutations were recovered and are illustrated in Fig. 3A. Some result in substitution of the cysteine residues that coordinate the zinc ion. These most likely disrupt the secondary structure of the zinc finger, accounting for the loss of interaction. However, several mutations fall outside of these positions. Mapping of these onto a NMR-based solution structure of the amino zinc finger of chicken GATA-1 reveals that they cluster on the surface of the zinc finger opposite to its DNA-binding surface (Fig. 3B). These residues are highly conserved among all vertebrate GATA factors. Indeed, all six GATA family members are capable of interacting with both FOG-1 and FOG2 based on in vitro binding and/or yeast two hybrid assays [13,20].

5.2. FOG interacting domains Multiple zinc fingers of FOG proteins are individually capable of interacting with GATA factors [33]. These correspond to Zfs 1,5,6, and 9 of murine FOG-1. Interestingly, all of these zinc fingers are of the variant C2HC type. This structure appears to be important for the interaction since substitution of histidine for the final cysteine, to generate a classical C2H2 structure, markedly impairs binding [34]. However, the C2H2 structure alone is not sufficient to specify GATA binding, since FOG-1 Zf7, FOG-2 Zf7, and Ushaped Zf4, which are of the C2HC type, are incapable of interacting with GATA proteins [33]. Amino acid sequence alignments of several GATA-binding zinc fingers are shown in Fig. 4A, and are grouped based on strength of interaction by yeast-two hybrid assays. Based on this sequence analysis,

and alanine mutational scanning of these zinc fingers, Crossley and his colleagues have proposed a consensus sequence for GATA binding consisting of X-X-X-F-X-C-X-X-C-X-IX-X-R/S-X-X-X-T/N-X-X-X-H-X-X-Y-Y-C-X-X-X (where X stands for any amino acid residue). Mapping of these critical residues onto an NMR solution structure of U-shaped Zf1 reveals that they cluster on one surface of the zinc finger domain (Fig. 4B). Although four zinc fingers of FOG proteins are capable of interacting with GATA proteins in vitro, the true stoichiometry of GATA and FOG protein binding in vivo has yet to be reported. Why FOG proteins contain multiple GATA binding Zfs is not known. Mutant FOG-1 molecules capable of binding GATA factors through only one of their four GATA-binding Zfs are capable of rescuing erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation of a Hox11 immortalized FOG-1-/- cell line about as well as wild type [35]. Therefore, GATA factor binding via multiple Zfs is not essential to FOG function, at least in this assay system.

6.1. FOG­GATA-1 interactions in human disease Inherited mutations that disrupt binding of GATA-1 to FOG-1 are associated with a syndrome of severe X-linked macrothrombocytopenia and dyserythropoietic anemia in humans (GATA-1 is located on the X-chromosome in humans). The first family reported involves a mother who had two pregnancies with male offspring complicated by severe fetal anemia, requiring in utero red blood cell transfusions [36]. The affected boys were also severely thrombocytopenic, having platelet counts of around 11,000­24,000/ul (normal range 150,000­400,000/ul) and had abnormally large platelet volumes (macrothrombocytopenia). Both boys also had cryptorchidism. Peripheral blood smears demonstrated abnormalities of red blood cell size and shape, in addition to a paucity of platelets. Their bone marrows were hypercellular and showed evidence of dyserythropoiesis (large, multinucleated erythroid precursors) and an abundance of small, dysplastic megakaryocytes. Both boys later required bone marrow transplantation. Sequencing of their GATA-1 gene revealed the presence of a missense mutation within the amino zinc finger region at position 205, resulting in substitution of methionine for glycine (V205M). This is remarkably similar to the valine 205 to glycine (V205G) substitution isolated in the yeast altered specificity mutant screen of murine GATA1. In fact, V205M was also recovered in this earlier yeast screen. This mutation significantly impairs FOG-1 binding by GATA-1, but does not alter DNA-binding activity when assayed by electromobility shift assays on synthetic oligonucleotides. The mother, an obligate carrier, experienced moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count 53,000/ul) and mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.3 g/dl versus 12­16 g/dl for normal population) during pregnancy. Examination of the DNA from 50 healthy controls failed to identify the mutation. Since this initial report, different GATA-1 mutations have been identified in other families with X-linked macrothrombocytopenia (summarized in Table 2). Drachman and his colleagues described a case of X-linked macrothrombocytopenia affecting four males in two generations due to substitution of glycine at codon 208 by serine (G208S) [37]. Like the V205G substitution, this mutation impairs FOG-1 binding, although to a considerably lesser degree, and does not affect DNA binding. Interestingly, these patients suffer from severe macrothrombocyopenia and profound bleeding, but no anemia and only mild dyserythropoiesis. Similarly, Van Geet and her colleagues reported a fourgeneration family of X-linked macrothrombocytopenia and mild dyserythropoiesis due to substitution of glycine for aspartate at codon 218 (D218G) [38]. This mutation results in weak loss of affinity for FOG-1, and no detectable change in DNA-binding activity. Platelets from the affected individuals appear markedly immature and lack the membrane glycoproteins GPIb , GPIb , GPIIIa, GPIX, and GPV found on normal platelets. In vitro functional assays demonstrate markedly impaired ristocetin-induced agglutination of the mutant platelets, as expected due to the loss of the GPI/V/IX

6. Functional importance of FOG­GATA interactions The functional significance of FOG­GATA interactions was initially examined using cell-based assays of GATA function. A mutant GATA-1 containing substitution of valine 205 in the amino zinc finger by glycine, which markedly impairs FOG binding, fails to rescue erythroid maturation of G1E cells, whereas wild type GATA-1 gives robust rescue [31]. Importantly, co-expression of a compensatory mutant of FOG-1 that restores binding to the mutant GATA-1 enables terminal maturation of the cells. This rules out non-specific effects of the GATA-1 mutation as an explanation for its loss of activity. Similarly, a mutant FOG-1 molecule impaired in GATA factor binding (substitution of a key tyrosine residue by glycine in each of Zfs 1,5,6, and 9) fails to rescue erythroid maturation of FOG-1-/- cells, whereas wild type FOG-1 is active [33,35]. These findings indicate that direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is required for normal erythroid differentiation. A similar requirement for direct interaction between GATA and FOG molecules has been documented in vivo. Hemizygous male mice containing a knock-in mutation substituting glycine for valine at position 205 in their GATA-1 gene (GATA-1KI ) die at around E10.5 from severe anemia with a block in erythroid maturation at a stage similar to that seen in GATA-1- mice [3,18]. In addition, megakaryocytes from these mice exhibit abnormalities, including hyperproliferation and impaired expression of terminal megakaryocyte marker genes, reminiscent of those found in GATA-1 deficient megakaryocytes, indicating the requirement for a GATA-1­FOG interaction in late megakaryocyte maturation [4,5].

complex. These patients also exhibit only mild dyserythropoiesis and are not anemic. Substitution at the same codon with tyrosine (D218Y) results in a much greater reduction in FOG-1 binding, and a much more severe phenotype [39]. These patients suffer from profound thrombocytopenia, anemia, and early mortality. Female carriers show skewed X-inactivation, favoring cells containing the wild type allele. Taken together, these cases illustrate a correlation between the degree of affinity loss between GATA-1 and FOG-1, and severity of illness, although it is not possible to rule out additional effects of the different mutations. Interestingly, the megakaryocytic lineage appears to be more sensitive to loss of GATA­FOG interaction than the erythroid lineage. We and our colleagues have described a family with a mutation at codon 216 (substitution of arginine by glutamine (R216Q)) of the amino zinc finger of GATA-1 [40]. This residue is predicted to reside on the surface of the zinc finger that contacts DNA, and is opposite to the FOG interaction domain. As expected, this mutation impairs binding to DNA at palindromic GATA sites (but not single GATA sites), but does not significantly affect FOG-1 binding when measured in vitro. These patients suffer from macrothrombocytopenia and beta-thalassemia. 6.2. Requirement for interactions between other FOG and GATA family members The critical role of direct interactions between FOG and GATA proteins extend beyond that observed for FOG-1 and GATA-1. Homozygous mice carrying the equivalent valine 205 to glycine substitution in their GATA-4 gene (GATA4KI/KI ) die during embryogenesis from a complex congenital cardiac defect that largely phenocopies FOG-2-/- embryos [23,24,41]. Likewise, these mice exhibit abnormalities of gonadal differentiation observed in FOG-2-/- mice [25]. Thus, GATA­FOG interactions play critical roles in broad developmental settings, reflecting the expression patterns of different members. It seems reasonable to speculate that mutations affecting GATA/FOG interactions in non-hematopoietic tissues may also be associated with human developmental diseases. Preliminary studies from an ENU-mutagenesis screen in mice have identified a hypomorphic allele of FOG-2 that is associated with bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia and a diaphragmatic muscularization defect (K.G. Ackerman and D.R. Beier, personal communication). In humans, chromosomal translocation or deletions involving chromosome 8q22.3, which contains the locus for FOG-2, are highly associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In one case, a heterozygous FOG-2 mutation resulting in the generation of a premature stop codon (R112X) was identified in an infant who died from a diaphragmatic defect and severe bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia (K.G. Ackerman and D.R. Beirer, personal communication). The strength of binding between FOG and GATA proteins, as measured by biophysical techniques on isolated zinc fin-

gers, is relatively weak compared to other protein­protein interactions (affinities of 104 and 105 M-1 ) [42]. While it is possible that the true strength of interaction is higher within the cellular environment, the profound abnormalities observed as a result of disrupted GATA­FOG interactions described above serve to illustrate that alterations of even weak interactions can have drastic biologic consequences [43].

7. FOG proteins: friend or foe While GATA factors require interactions with FOG proteins for some of their functions, they also have FOG independent roles. In some instances, FOG proteins appear to actually antagonize GATA factors. As discussed earlier, eosinophils express GATA-1, but not FOG factors [13,44]. Recent work indicates that GATA-1 is required for eosinophil development [45]. This implies that GATA-1 functions independent of FOG in the eosinophil lineage. Consistent with this, Nerlov and his colleagues have shown that FOG-1 expression is markedly down regulated during differentiation of eosinophils from multipotent precursors using a chicken myb-ets transformed cell system [46]. In fact, down regulation of FOG-1 is a prerequisite for eosinophil development since enforced expression blocks eosinophil maturation, and ectopic expression in an eosinophilic cell line transforms it into a more primitive state. We and our colleagues have observed similar effects of FOG-1 on mast cell development (A.B. Cantor, H. Iwaski, K. Akashi, and S.H. Orkin, unpublished observation). Like eosinophils, mast cells express GATA factors, but no FOG proteins. Functionally, GATA-2 is required for generation of mast cells, whereas GATA-1 is necessary for upregulation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcERI) during terminal maturation [7,47]. This implies that GATA factors act in a FOGindependent manner in mast cell development. Consistent with this, yolk sac derived mast cells from GATA-1- embryos express reduced levels of FcERI, but those from GATA1KI embryos express wild type levels. Several experimental pieces of evidence suggest that FOG proteins may play an antagonistic role in mast cell development. First, enforced expression of FOG-1 in purified granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) completely abolishes their ability to form mast cells in vitro. Second, ectopic expression of FOG-1 in bone marrow-derived mast cells causes marked apoptosis, whereas a non-GATA binding mutant has no effect. Third, there is a marked expansion of yolk sac derived mast cell progenitors from FOG-1-/- mice compared to wild type [17] (A.B. Cantor and S. H. Orkin, unpublished observation). Studies of Drosophila hematopoiesis have also documented antagonistic roles of FOG family proteins [48,49]. Drosophila contain three major types of blood cells: plasmatocytes, which form the majority of circulating cells; crystal cells, which neutralize foreign material through a process of melanization; and lamellocytes, a rare population that is induced under certain conditions of immune challenge (for re-

view, see [50]). All three blood types are derived from a common multipotent prohemocyte. The Drosophila GATA factor serpent (srp) is required for the generation of prohemocytes, as well as their terminal differentiation. ush is also expressed in hematopoietic multipotent progenitors. It cooperates with srp in the formation of plasmatocytes, but is down regulated during crystal cell formation [48]. Enforced expression of ush in the crystal cell lineage ablates crystal cell formation. This activity requires a physical interaction between ush and srp [49]. In contrast, ush loss-of-function mutants exhibit expansion of the crystal cell population [48]. These findings are strikingly similar to those involving GATA and FOG proteins in vertebrate erythroid/megakaryocytic and eosinophil/mast cell development. More broadly, they illustrate combinatorial control of FOG and GATA factors on lineage output, and suggest a potential role in cell fate determination.

8. FOG protein­protein interactions 8.1. C-terminal binding protein A common feature among all identified FOG proteins is the presence of a binding motif, Pro-X-Asp-Leu-Ser (PXDLS), for the co-repressor C-terminal binding protein. CtBP was first identified as a molecule that binds to the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein [51]. Disruption of this interaction increases the tumorigenicity and transcriptional activity of E1A [52]. Since then, CtBP has been shown to interact with a wide variety of transcription factors including ZEB, Net, TGIF, and MEF2-interacting transcription repressor (MITR) [53­56]. Mutations that disrupt binding of TGIF and CtBP are associated with holoprosencephaly in humans [55]. Within the hematopoietic system, CtBP has been shown to associate with the transcription factors Ikaros, BKLF, and Evi [57­59]. CtBP forms multiprotein complexes containing histone deacetylases HDAC1 and 2, histone methyltransferases G9a and Eu-HMTase, chromodomain-containing proteins HPC2 and CDYL, and coREST, a corepressor of the REST transcription factors [60]. These complexes exhibit both histone deacetylase and methyltransferase enzymatic activity when assayed in nucleosomal systems. Based on this, it has been proposed that CtBP complexes coordinate histone modifications leading to a transcriptionally repressed state. Physical interaction between FOG proteins and CtBP has been documented by co-immunoprecipitation, GST-pull down, and yeast two-hybrid assays [27,33,61]. However, the true functional significance of these interactions is not clear. In several experimental systems in which overexpression of FOG proteins blunts GATA-mediated transcriptional activity and/or alters developmental outcome, use of FOG mutants incapable of binding to CtBP show reduced activity. This includes transcriptional reporter assays performed in NIH3T3 cells, ectopic FOG expression in xenopus embryos and explant assays, and transgenic expression in Drosophila [27,30,33,48]. This implies that CtBP, or a related molecule,

plays a role in these repressive effects. Surprisingly, homozygous knock-in mice containing amino acid substitutions within the FOG-1 PXDLS motif, which disrupt binding to CtBP, survive to adulthood and have normal hematopoiesis under baseline and hemolytic stress conditions [61]. No other obvious gross developmental abnormalities are present in these mice. The discrepancy between findings of the knockin mice and the other experimental systems may be due to compensatory mechanisms in mice not possible in the other systems, or possibly artifacts from overexpression of FOG proteins in the in vitro systems. It is also possible that the knock-in mice have subtle defects in tissues not examined. Further studies will be needed to clarify the role of CtBP interactions in FOG function. 8.2. TACC3 As discussed earlier, a characteristic finding among FOG proteins is the presence of a "double-zinc finger" motif found in several other transcription factors. This motif is thought to be involved in DNA­protein and protein­protein interactions. FOG-1 mutants lacking Zfs 1­4, which removes the double zinc finger between Zfs 2 and 3, show enhanced ability to rescue megakaryocyte differentiation from a FOG-1-/- cell line compared to wild type [35]. This suggests that this region may interact with a factor that represses FOG-1 function. Recently, we and others have performed yeast two-hybrid screens employing Zfs 1­4 of FOG-1 as bait, and identified the murine homolog of the human transforming acidic coiledcoil protein 3 (TACC3) as an interacting partner [14,43]. Structural studies show that the interaction occurs between an alpha helix of FOG-1 zf3, a motif classically thought to mediate protein­DNA interactions, and a small region within the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of TACC3 [43]. TACC3 is a member of a family of proteins containing highly conserved C-terminal coiled-coil domains. TACC3 is highly expressed in all hematopoietic sites including bone marrow, fetal liver, thymus and spleen, and overlaps the temporal and spatial expression pattern of FOG-1 and GATA-1 [62]. It has been shown to interact with the transcription factors ARNT and Stat5, the latter an erythropoietin-induced gene in erythroid progenitors [62­64]. Knock-out of the TACC3 gene in mice leads to growth retardation and embryonic lethality [62]. Hematopoietic stem cells from TACC3-/- mice are capable of terminal differentiation but have impaired proliferation in vitro and in vivo. TACC3 expression levels are tightly regulated. It is highly expressed in proliferating cells and early stages of differentiation, and markedly downregulated during differentiation [65]. Within the cell cycle, a peak of expression is seen during M phase. In mitotic cells, TACC3 is localized to centrosomic regions and is associated with the spindle apparatus. During interphase, TACC3 is distributed in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of TACC3 shifts the subcellular localization ARNT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. TACC3 has a similar effect on FOG-1 localization in transfected 293T

cells [14]. Co-expression of GATA-1, which competes with TACC3 for binding to FOG-1, restores the nuclear localization of FOG-1. Overexpression of TACC3 relieves FOG-1 mediated transcriptional repression in transient transfection reporter assays in 293T cells, and inhibits erythroid maturation of DMSO-induced MEL and estradiol-induced G1ER cells. Based on this, we have proposed a model in which TACC3 regulates FOG-1 activity. During early stages of differentiation, high TACC3 levels serve to sequester FOG-1 in the cytoplasm. This prevents the cooperative effects of FOG-1 on GATA-1 mediated activation of terminal maturation genes. As differentiation proceeds, TACC3 levels decrease and GATA-1 levels increase. This enables more FOG-1 to translocate to the nucleus (and/or be retained there) where it coregulates GATA dependent genes. Consistent with our model, it has recently been reported that FOG-1 shifts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in the cells of GATA-3-/- mice [66].

9. FOG function Despite the critical role that FOG proteins play in GATA activity, both positive and negative, its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Several groups have examined FOG family proteins for direct DNA-binding activity. As of yet, no sequence-specific, high-affinity binding activity of the native intact protein has been detected [28], (A.P. Tsang, S.G. Tevosian, M. Garriga-Canut, and S.H. Orkin, unpublished observation). Rather, it seems that FOG proteins exert their activity via protein­protein interactions. Many groups have examined the ability of FOG family members to modulate GATA factor-mediated transcriptional activity using transcriptional reporter assays in transiently transfected cells. Both transcriptional co-activation and corepression has been reported, depending on cell type and promoter used [13,19,21,22,27,29,33,67­69]. The contextdependency of these effects is not well understood. However, it is important to interpret these results cautiously since they examine effects on non-chromatinized DNA templates, use non-physiologic protein expression levels, and in some cases utilize heterologous cells. It is also important to avoid equating transcriptional repressor activity with lineage repression in vivo, since it is possible that transcriptional activation of an inhibitory factor could account for negative developmental outcome. Recent studies utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have revealed a potential role of FOG proteins in facilitating chromatin binding of GATA factors [70,71]. GATA1 and GATA-2 play predominantly reciprocal roles during hematopoietic development. GATA-2 is required for the expansion of multipotential progenitor cells and is down regulated as cells differentiate. In contrast, GATA-1 expression increases during terminal maturation and correlates with reduced proliferation. Bresnick and his colleagues have identified an enhancer element located 2.8 kB upstream of the

126

transcriptional start site of the GATA-2 gene that contains a functional GATA site and plays an important role in GATA2 regulation [72]. They have proposed a model in which GATA-2 binds to this site in early hematopoietic cells and activates transcription, generating a positive feedback loop. As the cells differentiate and GATA-1 levels increase, GATA-1 competes for GATA-2 at this site and inhibits GATA-2 transcription. Using ChIP assays in rescued FOG-1-/- cells, we and our colleagues have shown that this GATA factor switching requires the presence of FOG-1. Examination of other GATA regulatory sites, such as in ALAS intron 8, -globin hypersensitive (HS)-26, and a site within GATA-1 regulatory elements itself (HS1), demonstrate similar FOG dependent switching of GATA-1 for GATA-2. This suggests that facilitation of chromatin binding of GATA-1 by FOG-1 is a more general phenomenon. Given that mutant GATA-1 molecules with impaired FOG binding, exhibit normal DNA affinity for synthetic DNA in heterologous cells, this suggests that chromatin structure and/or cellular environment plays an important role in this aspect of FOG function. Similar to other reports of FOG function, its role in facilitating GATA-1 chromatin occupancy is also site selective. Blobel and his colleagues have shown that FOG-1 is required for efficient binding of GATA-1 to the -major globin promoter and HS2 of the -globin locus control region, but not HS3 or the EKLF promoter in rescued G1E cells [71]. What dictates which sites require FOG proteins for GATA factor binding facilitation is unknown. Interestingly, FOG dependent GATA-1 chromatin occupancy correlate with changes in histone acetylation in the vicinity of GATA binding [70,71]. Whether FOG is participating directly in these changes is not known. However, a recent report examining the transcriptional repressive effects of FOG-2 on GATA-4 demonstrates that overexpression of the histone acetyl transferase p300 titrates the repressive effects of FOG-2 [73]. Although circumstantial, these findings point to a potential role of FOG proteins in chromatin remodeling.

either transcriptional coactivators versus corepressors. Perhaps further understanding the rules that dictate this contextdependency will provide the key to unlocking the secrets of FOG function.

10. Conclusions The evolutionarily conserved family of FOG zinc finger proteins plays essential developmental roles through their coregulation of diverse GATA transcription factors. Mutations that disrupt their interaction result in several human diseases. Given the wide tissue distribution and functional roles of these protein families, it seems likely that other human diseases may also be due to alterations in GATA­FOG interactions. Considerable progress has been made in characterizing FOG proteins since they were first discovered about seven years ago, and identifying some of their interacting partners. However, their mechanism of action remains unknown. Circumstantial evidence points to a role in chromatin remodeling, but direct proof is lacking. One of the great mysteries of FOG proteins is how in different contexts they act as
