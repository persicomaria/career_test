ABSTRACT The crystal structure of GST Nu2-2 (HpolGSTN2-2) from the model hookworm nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus has been solved by the molecular replacement method and refined to a resolution of 1.71 Å, providing the first structural data from a class of nematode-specific GSTs. By structural alignment with two Sigma class GSTs, glutathione could be rationally docked into the G-site of the enzyme. By comparing with all mammalian GST classes, a novel, long, and deep cleft was identified at the H-site, providing a potential site for ligand binding. This new GST class may support the establishment of infection parasitic nematodes by passively neutralizing chemical toxins derived from host environment. The structure serves as a starting point for structure-based drug/inhibitor design that would aim to selectively disrupt nematode chemical defenses. Proteins 2005;61:1024 ­1031.

Key words: glutathione transferase Nu2-2; molecular replacement method; ligand binding; crystal structure INTRODUCTION GST [Enzyme Commission (EC) 2.5.1.18] is a dimeric enzyme catalyzing the conjugation of GSH to xenobiotic compounds such as carcinogens, therapeutics, and cytotoxic products of oxidative stress in the Phase II enzymatic detoxification system.1 Besides their conjugation activity, GSTs also have the ability to bind to numerous ligands and are involved in resistance to insecticides and herbicides.2­5 Specific GSTs may play a role in anticancer drug resistance by regulating the MAP kinase pathway via protein­ protein interactions with JNK1 and ASK1 in response to cellular stress.6 Recently, a major nematode Caenorhabditis elegans specific GST (CE01613) was reported to have protein­protein interactions within nematode MAP kinase signal transduction pathway.7 Some GSTs also have proposed molecular housekeeping roles in the binding and transport of hydrophobic ligands in leukotriene synthesis and in amino acid catabolism.8 It is normally accepted that GSTs of the same class share more than 60% sequence identity, while GSTs of different classes share less than 30% identity. According to these criteria, seven species©

independent soluble GST classes have been proposed in mammals: Alpha, Theta, Zeta, Mu, Pi, Sigma, and Omega.9,10,11 Similarly, the classification for nonmammalian GSTs has been well reviewed based on the primary structure comparisons, immunoblotting, substrate specificity properties, or inhibitor sensitivity.12 Parasitic nematodes infect both animals and plants. To effectively live in their hosts, parasitic nematodes could express a number of GSTs to detoxify endogenous and xenobiotic electrophilic compounds and protect themselves from being killed by helminthes. The mouse/strongylid nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus system is a readily manipulated small animal laboratory model for the study of host­parasite interactions and to explore methods of infection control.13 Based on this and other parasitic worm models, the overall GST activity in nematodes has been shown to be upregulated during chronic infection of their hosts.14 Therefore, the design of inhibitors specific to GSTs expressed only by parasitic nematodes has novel implications for both human health and animal husbandry. Multiple sequence alignment and evolutionary tree analysis suggested that HpolGSTN2-2 belongs to a new class (Nu class) of GST specific to lower invertebrate parasites.15 However, no structural data for this new class of nematode-specific GSTs has been available, while this

data is the prerequisite to carry out structure-based drug/inhibitor design. Here we report a high-resolution (1.71 Å) crystal structure of rHpolGSTN2-2, representing the first structure from this nematode-specific GST family. By comparing with all mammalian GST classes, a novel, long, and deep cleft was identified at the normal H-site, providing a potential ligand-binding site. The site is composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues; thus, it has the ability to accept various ligands, such as FBZ (normally used as helminthes). The binding and inhibition of FBZ to rHpolGSTN2-2 have been experimentally confirmed. By structural alignment, glutathione was docked into the enzyme. The crystal structure of rHpolGSTN2-2 may provide an initial model for the study of protein­protein interactions in response to cell stress, such as ROS. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ligand Binding and Inhibitor Assay The binding and inhibition of FBZ (Sigma Co.) to rHpolGSTN2-2 were studied by measuring the changes of protein intrinsic fluorescence and the IC50 value. To measure the changes of intrinsic protein fluorescence induced by ligand binding, a final concentration of 1 M rHpolGSTN2-2 was used at 25°C in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 100 mM sodium chloride. Changes in fluorescence were recorded using a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (RF-5301PC) with excitation and emission wavelengths for intrinsic protein fluorescence of 280 nm and 320 nm, respectively. Increasing concentrations of FBZ were added, followed by a 3 min incubation time prior to measurement. The KD values were calculated by the method of Van der Jagt et al.16 Structure Determination and Refinement Protein purification, crystallization, and crystallographic data collection have been previously reported.17

The initial phases were obtained by the molecular replacement method with program BEAST18 using an animal Sigma class GST (rat HPGDS; PDB code: 1PD2) as the search model.19 The molecular replacement solution was stripped to polyalanine and fed into phase refinement and extension utilizing solvent flattening and eight-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging with program MAGICSQUASH.20 The model was rebuilt in TOM (Chirino and Israel, personal communication), a port of FRODO.21 Other crystallographic software manipulations were carried out with the CCP4 suite.22 After rounds of model refinement and manual model adjustment, the noncrystallographic constraints were removed, and the model was subjected to further refinement against a maximum likelihood target using TLS parameters with REFMAC5,23,24

connected by helix 1; and 3 and 4 are also antiparallel, linked by a turn 57­59. The domain contains seven -helices ( 4 ­ 10). Helices- 6 and - 7 (as well as 9 and 10) are directly attached to each other without a loop or turn between them. The C-terminal 10 folds back to the N-terminal domain due to a conformationally constrained residue Pro192 between 9 and 10. Sequence and Structural Comparison of rHpolGSTN2-2 with Sigma Class GSTs H. polygyrus nematode rHpolGSTN2-2 has low sequence identities to known classes of GSTs in mammals, insects, and plants. Sequence homology search from PDB reveals that rHpolGSTN2-2 has the highest sequence homology to Drosophila GST-2 and mammal HPDGS, with sequence identities of about 33% [Fig. 3(A)], both of which are members of sigma class GSTs. There are more identical residues in the N-terminal mixed / domain than in the C-terminal domain, showing that the N-terminal domain is more conserved than the C-terminal domain under the evolution stress. The structural alignment of the above three structures gives a consistent result. The N-terminal domains overlap much better than the Cterminal domains do [Fig. 3(B)]. The N-terminal domains' RMSDs between rHpolGSTN2-2 and the two Sigma class GSTs (Drosophila GST-2 and mammalian HPDGS) are 0.74 Å and 0.72 Å, respectively, while the C-terminal domains' RMSD values are higher (1.40 Å and 1.25 Å, respectively). Corresponding to the lowest sequence identities at the region of 103­120, where major deletions/ insertions occur, there are large structural variations at the region consisting mainly by helix 5, N-terminal region of helix 6, and the loop connecting 5 and 6 [Fig. 3(B)]. Helix 6 in rHpolGSTN2-2 is shorter than the corresponding helix in mammal and Drosophila Sigma class GSTs. It is noted that helix 5 (residues 103­109) is specific in rHpolGSTN2-2 but not presented in mammalian and Drosophila Sigma class GSTs. This unique helix actually bends from helix 4 and points to the interdomain, and it takes part in the formation of an interdomain cleft by providing a hydrophobic residue Tyr106 [Fig. 4(A)]. The other significant structural differences between these structures are located at the N-terminus of helix 8. Helix 8 is straight in rHpolGSTN2-2 and mammalian HPDGS, but is displaced to G-site in Drosophila GST-2. The conservation of the N-terminal domain and variations of the C-terminal domain may reflect that the GSH binding ability is vital for the GST evolution as GSH binds to residues at the N-terminal domain. Mutations at the GSH-binding domain may disrupt the enzyme's function while mutations at the C-terminal domain provide various kinds of clefts for binding of substrates or ligands. Subunit­Subunit Interactions Like other GSTs, rHpolGSTN2-2 is a dimer in both solution and crystal stabilized by hydrophilic interactions near the two-fold axis and hydrophobic interactions far away from the two-fold axis along the dimer interface. The buried surface area between the monomers is about 2250

resulting in a final crystallographic R factor and Rfree factor of 18.0% and 23.2%, respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Overall Structure The structure of rHpolGSTN2-2 has been solved by molecular replacement, although it had only 33% sequence identity with the search model, a rat HPGDS. The final refined crystal structure of rHpolGSTN2-2 contains eight molecules in the asymmetric unit, arranged as four homodimers. Each rHpolGSTN2-2 monomer consists of 206 amino acid residues. The backbones of the eight monomers are almost identical except for the regions of 33­ 49, 101­125 and 166 ­176, where obvious differences were observed (Fig. 1). Region 101­125 is best ordered in chain F, with only residue 114 missing, while a dozen or more residues are missing in other chains for the same region. The poorly ordered electron density at this region may reflect the protein's flexibility. The refinement statistics and the structural validation are listed in Table I. Similar to other GST structures, the rHpolGSTN2-2 monomer has two distinct domains: the N-terminal / domain (amino acid residues 1­75) and the C-terminal domain (amino acid residues 81­206) (Fig. 2). These two domains are connected by loop 75­ 81, with an interdomain cleft forming between them. The / domain contains three helices and four strands packed in a canonical motif, with a four-stranded -sheet sandwiched by three -helices. 1 and 2 are antiparallel,

The alignment was done with the program Swiss PDBViewer.26 (A) Structure based sequence alignment of rHpolGSTN2-2 with two Sigma class GSTs from Drosophila and human, respectively.

Å2, resulting from extensive hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, as listed in Table II. Such a buried interface is larger than that in Drosophila GST-2 (1790 Å2), but smaller than those in mammalian GSTs (range is 2700 ­ 3000 Å2). The main hydrophobic interactions come from two "lock and key" motifs. The keys are two phenylalanine residues at positions 48 and 83, and the locks consist of several hydrophobic residues. The first motif is canonical in Alpha, Pi, and Mu classes,28 and is formed by the insertion of Phe48 side-chain of one subunit into a crevice constructed by residues Leu91, Ala94, Phe135, and Phe139 of the other subunit. This motif is also present in mammalian and Drosophila Sigma class,29 but in Drosophila Sigma class enzyme, the key is a methionine instead of a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue. The second motif is formed by hydrophobic interactions between the other key residue (Phe83) of one subunit and Val56, Gln59, Leu61, and Tyr70 of the other subunit. Both hydrophobic "lock and key" motifs have their counterparts at the dimer interface related by the two-fold axis. However, for the hydrophilic dimeric interactions, it is interesting to find

that except for the two ion-pair interactions between Arg69 and Asp89, there are no counterparts for the hydrogen bond interactions involving Lys138N -Pro47O, Ala66N-Asp93O 2, and Gln63N 2-Asp97O 2, suggesting that the interactions between the two subunits (biological dimer) are asymmetric (i.e., not perfectly related by the two-fold axis). G-Site Structure H. polygyrus nematode rHpolGSTN2-2 has low sequence identities to known classes of GSTs in mammals, insects, and plants. The highest sequence similarities found for rHpolGSTN2-2 are Drosophila GST-2, human HPDGS, rat HPDGS, and murine GSTA4-4, with sequence identities ranging from 34% to 31% [Fig. 3(A)]. The structural alignment of rHpolGSTN2-2 and Sigma-class GST structures reveal a similar secondary structure especially at the GSH-binding site, which provides a ready starting model for GSH binding in rHpolGSTN2-2. The initial model of GSH was extracted from rat HPDGS­GSH complex structure (PDB code: 1PD2) by structural align-

ment based on the least squares minimization of all C atoms of residues 1 to 75 (N-terminal / domain). Then, 200 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization implemented in CNS30 was introduced to optimize the rHpolGSTN2-2-GSH model and alleviate bad contacts. The final model of GSH binding to rHpolGSTN2-2 is shown in Figure 5. As in other GSTs, the SH group of the Cys moiety of GSH is stabilized by a Tyr8, which is conserved in all these structures [Fig. 3(A)]. This Tyr8 has been proposed as a hydrogen bond donor to the sulfur atom of GSH. The hydrogen bond interaction between Tyr8 and GSH sulphur atom may lower the pK of the thiol in the GST­GSH complex.31,32 The oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the Cys moiety have H-bond interactions with the mainchain nitrogen and oxygen atoms of residue Val51, respectively, where Val51 adopts a cis-conformation to optimize the interactions. The side-chain glutamyl residue in GSH points toward the interdomain cleft and is stabilized by the hydrogen bond interactions between carboxylate atoms and the N atom of Lys43. Similarly, the glycyl residue in GSH was also stabilized by H-bond interactions to Ser64. As a whole, the GSH binding site (G-site) mainly resides in the / domain, because all related residues (Tyr8, Lys43, Val51, and Ser64) are located in the N-terminal domain. H-Site and Potential Ligand Binding Unlike the conserved G-site in all GSTs, the H-site structure varies across different GST classes. The variations of H-site structures are due to the poor conservation of the C-terminal / domain and are responsible for varying substrate specificity and ligand-binding ability. The H-site in rHpolGSTN2-2 is a very long and deep cleft

as shown in Figures 4(A) and 6(A). The cleft is mainly constructed by hydrophobic residues Gly13, Ala14, and Gln65 from the domain and residues Tyr95, Tyr106, Leu159, and Phe206 from the / domain. Residue Phe206 at the tip of the C-terminus takes part in the formation of the H-site. Residues Arg201, Thr204, Pro205, and Phe206 within the C-terminal loop have extensive polar interactions with N-terminal peptide segment Arg12­Glu16 [Fig. 4(B)]. An additional hydrogen bonding interaction between the main-chain Pro205 O and Arg170 side-chain further stabilizes the C-terminal loop. Such interactions form a C-terminal capping structure [Fig. 4(B)]. Two proline residues (Pro202 and Pro205) in the C-terminal loop prevent the formation of a regular -helix or -strand structure due to proline backbone dihedral angle restraints. The ordered C-terminus may be related to the substrate­ligand specificity of the H-site. Sequence alignments for the C-terminal loops of various classes of GSTs reveal no obvious sequence homologs [Fig. 4(C)]. To get structural information about the C-terminal loops, we mapped the C-terminal loops on the surface of various GST classes (Nu, Sigma, Pi, Alpha, Mu, Omega, Zeta, Beta, and Theta) (Fig. 6). It seems that, in most classes, the C-terminal loop participates in the formation of H-site except for the Mu class [Fig. 6(G)] and the Beta class [Fig. 6(H)] GSTs, where no clear connection is observed between the C-terminal loop and the H-site. The H-site in rHpolGSTN2-2 is a 14-Å-long cleft, with a width ranging from 4 Å (middle) to 6Å (both ends) [Fig. 6(A)]. To determine whether the site is unique to parasite nematodes, we compared the H-site in rHpolGSTN2-2 with the H-sites in other mammalian GSTs of different classes. Surface structural comparisons among various classes of GSTs suggest that the H-site pocket in rHpolGSTN2-2 is unique (Fig. 6). The H-sites in mouse Pi class GST YfYf [Fig. 6(C)] and human Mu class GSTM2-2 [Fig. 6(E)] are round, hollow holes that extend to the other side of the enzyme. However, the holes are too small (3­ 4 Å in diameter) to contain the candidate inhibitors (e.g., FBZ) of rHpolGSTN2-2. The clefts in human Omega class GSTO1-1 [Fig. 6(F)] and bacterial Beta class PmGSTB1-1 [Fig. 6(H)] are large but very shallow, which may not favor tight interactions with inhibitors. The H-site in human Alpha class GSTA1-1 is also a deep but much shorter cleft,28 which even has enough room for the phenyl moiety of GSB [Fig. 6(D)]. Although the width of the hGSTA1-1 H-site (6 Å) is similar to that of rHpolGSTN2-2, the length of the hGSTA1-1 H-site (7 Å) is only half that of rHpolGSTN2-2. Consequently, the volume of the hGSTA1-1 H-site (400 Å3) is about half of that of rHpolGSTN2-2 (870 Å3). Therefore, the long and linear inhibitors specific for rHpolGSTN2-2 may not bind to the H-site of hGSTA1-1. Based on the unique structural feature of the H-site, rHpolGSTN-2 is a potential target for nematode control if specific inhibitors can be developed with minimum side effects in the hosts. FBZ is a commercial helminthes containing a hydrophobic group (phenylthiol moiety) and a hydrophilic group (benzimidazolecarbamate moiety). From intrinsic fluorescence analysis, the FBZ KD is 230 M.

ments of rHpolGSTN2-2 show that FBZ can inhibit the enzyme's GSH conjugate activity with an IC50 of 27.3 M. The binding behavior of FBZ to rHpolGSTN2-2 should be further characterized by crystallographic detection of their complex structures, and attempts at this have already begun.
