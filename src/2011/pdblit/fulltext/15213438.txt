Key words: NMR structure, RNA binding protein, SAV1595, UPF0044, YhbY Biological context The spread of resistant bacterial strains have made conventional antibiotics less effective (Hand, 2000). Therefore, the discovery of new antimicrobial agents has become urgent. Currently, nearly 110 microbial genomic sequences are available as a result of large scale genomic efforts (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/micr. html, National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). Analysis of genomic sequences has revealed many evolutionary conserved, functionally uncharacterized protein families which have been cataloged and annotated by several databases such as the Pfam database of protein families (Bateman et al., 2000) and the COG database of clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (Tatusov et al., 2001). Concerted efforts within the fields of bioinformatics, biochemistry, genetics and structural biology have been devoted to understand the structure, function, essentiality and genetics of these protein families. Data derived from these studies may yield potential new drug targets for the development of novel broad-spectrum antibiotics (Freiberg et al., 2001) and are important to the target selection process in the pharmaceutical industry. SAV1595 is a hypothetical Staphylococcus aureus protein. It contains 96 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 11.1 kDa. SAV1595 is a member of a conserved protein family designated as UPF0044 and COG1534 by the Pfam and the COG database, respectively. This protein family is composed of proteins of uncharacterized function with molecular weights ranging from 10 to 15 kDa. Although the members of UPF0044 have been implicated in RNA splicing and translation (Ostheimer et al., 2002), their exact biological functions are still unknown. The crystal structures of two homologs of UPF0044 from E. coli
 To

(YhbY) and Haemophilus influenzae (HI1333) have recently been reported (Ostheimer et al., 2002; Willis et al., 2002). SAV1595 has sequence identities of 38% and 36% with YhbY and HI1333, respectively. YhbY and HI1333 are / proteins with an ------ topology, similar to that of the C-terminal domain of the translation initiation factor 3 which binds RNA. The structural analysis of YhbY and HI1333 indicate that the members of UPF0044 are likely RNA binding proteins. Here, we report the NMR resonance assignments and solution structure of SAV1595. These data will serve as a basis for further structural and functional characterization of the UPF0044 protein family, and for evaluating SAV1595 as a potential target for the screening of customized small molecule libraries by NMR (Shuker et al., 1996). Methods and results Recombinant SAV1595 was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The cell cultures were grown at 37  C in M9 minimal medium with 15 NH4 Cl as the sole nitrogen source and/or 13 C-glucose as the sole carbon source. Proteins were produced and purified as described previously (Liu et al., 2002). The Cterminal His-tag with a sequence of LEHHHHHH was not removed. NMR samples containing 0.3­1.0 mM protein were prepared in 75 mM Ki PO4 , pH 7.5, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.015% NaN3 and 8% D2 O. NMR experiments were performed at 25  C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer. The HNCO, CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, 15 N-edited NOESYHSQC and 15 N-edited TOCSY-HSQC experiments (Proteinpack, Varian Inc.) were used to obtain 1 HN , 1 H, 15 N, 13 C , 13 C and 13 C resonance assignments. Side chain resonance assignments were obtained based on HCCH-TOCSY, 15 N-edited TOCSYHSQC and 13 C/15 N-resolved [1 H,1 H]-NOESY data (Kanelis et al., 2001). The methyl groups of Val and Leu residues were stereospecifically assigned using a

392 10% 13 C-labeled sample (Neri et al., 1989). The NMR data were processed with FELIX980 (Accelrys Inc.) and analyzed with NMRView (Johnson and Blevins, 1994) on a Silicon Graphics workstation. Backbone resonances for 88 out of 93 assignable non-proline residues were assigned. The assignments for all the side chain NH2 groups from Asn and Gln residues were obtained. Four peaks in the spectrum were assigned to the LEHH sequence in the C-terminal His-tag. No peaks for residues Leu40, Glu41, Arg43, Glu44, Leu45 were found in the 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum. A rather broadened peak was assigned to residue Asn42 based on the 13 C chemical shifts from the CBCANH/CBCA(CO)NH experiments. Side chain 1 H and 13 C resonance assignments are nearly complete for those residues with assigned backbone resonances. Although the 1 H-15 N cross peaks of Glu41 and Leu45 were absent in the HSQC spectrum, their side chain 1 H-13 C cross peaks were observed in the 1 H-13 C HSQC spectrum, and could be assigned based on the 13 C chemical shifts and NOE information. The 1 H, 15 N, and 13 C chemical shifts have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under accession number 5763. The solution structure of SAV1595 was determined using a simulated annealing protocol within XPLOR98 (Accelrys Inc.). A 15 N-edited NOESYHSQC spectrum (Figure 1; m = 100 ms, Zhang et al., 1994) and 13 C/15 N-resolved [1 H,1 H]-NOESYHSQC (m = 125 ms, Pascal et al., 1994) spectra in D2 O and H2 O buffer were acquired to obtain the NOE distance restraints. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were obtained using the program TALOS based on the backbone 1 H, 13 C, 13 C and 13 C chemical shifts (Cornilescu et al., 1999). The hydrogen bond restraints were determined based on the slow exchanging amide protons identified by recording 1 H-15 N HSQC two hours after a 15 N-labeled SAV1595 protein sample had been exchanged into a D2 O buffer. The distance restraints used for structure calculations included 1338 NOE restraints obtained from an analysis of NOESY datasets and 86 hydrogen bond restraints (Table 1). 10 energy-minimized conformers with the lowest overall energy were selected from 50 calculated structures to represent the solution structure of SAV1595. The overall RMSD values relative to the mean structure of the 10 representative conformers (Figure 2A) were 0.63 ± 0.09 Å and 1.18 ± 0.17 Å, for the backbone atoms (C , C and N) and all heavy atoms, respectively, of the same region. For the residues in the regular secondary structures (residues 4­13(1),

22­24(1), 30­42(2), 45­50(2), 57­69(3), 72­ 77(3) and 80­84(4)), the RMSD of backbone and heavy atoms were 0.39 ± 0.05 Å and 0.86 ± 0.05 Å, respectively. The overall topology of SAV1595 is -----. A  sheet is formed by a mixed arrangement of four strands (Figure 2B). Strands 2, 3 and 4 are arranged in antiparallel fashion, while strand 1 is parallel to strand 2. The first helix (residues 4­13) packs against one face of the  sheet, helix 2 (residues 30­42) and helix 3 (residues 57­69) are located on the opposite side. The main interactions of helix 1 and helix 2 with the  sheet are hydrophobic. Residues Leu10 and Leu13 from helix 1 together with Ala14 and Ile17 form a hydrophobic core with the  sheet residues Leu45, Val74, Val82 and Tyr84. The position of helix 1 relative to the  sheet is further determined by additional interactions between Lys7 and Gln75 and Lys11 and Gln75. The  sheet residues Ile23, Ile46, Val48 and Val50 together with residues Ile20 and Phe21 interact with residues Met32, Ile36, Thr39 and Leu40 of

helix 2 to form another hydrophobic core on the other side of the  sheet. In contrast, helix 3 displays only very limited hydrophobic interactions with the central  sheet through Ala62 with Ile81. The relative orientation of helix 3 is largely determined by the interactions with helix 2. Residues Leu61, Leu65 and Thr69 of helix 3 contact the corresponding hydrophobic surface formed by residues Ile28, Ile33, Leu40 and Val50. It is interesting that the C-terminus of SAV1595 is relatively well structured even in the absence of regular secondary structure. The C-terminal residues are stabilized through both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with the rest of the protein. The main hydrophobic interactions involve residues Ile93 and Leu95 which interacts with Leu10 and Tyr84, respectively, while residues Lys88 and Lys91 interact with Glu41 and Ser87. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID code 1RQ8). Discussion and conclusions The crystal structures of two other members of the UFP0044 family, namely YhbY and HI1333 of gramnegative bacteria E. coli and H. Influenzae, respect-

ively, have been solved. SAV1595 is a member of UFP0044 from gram-positive bacteria. The solution structure of SAV1595 and the crystal structures of YhbY and HI1333 are highly similar, superposition of 88 C atoms of SAV1595 and YhbY give an rmsd value of 1.60 Å. This is consistent with the high degree of sequence conservation between the members of UFP0044 proteins and confirms the structural conservation between UFP0044 proteins from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. As has been discussed for YhbY and HI1333 (Ostheimer et al., 2002; Willis et al., 2002), UFP0044 proteins share a similar fold with several nucleic acid binding proteins, including the C-terminal domain of prokaryotic initiation factor 3, suggesting an RNA binding function for members of the UFP0044 family. Analysis of the electrostatic surface properties revealed a basic molecular surface largely formed by conserved residues Lys7, Arg8, Lys11, Lys47 and Lys58 (Figure 3A). In addition, residues 24 to 27 of SAV1595 with a sequence of GKGG, identified as a putative Gly-X-X-Gly RNA binding motif (Grishin, 2001), resides on the same side of the molecule as the positively charged molecular surface. The Gly-X-X-Gly motif can interact with

394 the nucleic acid directly, as observed for the Gly-X-XGly motif in Nova KH domains, a sequence specific RNA binding domain (Lewis et al., 2000). The Gly-XX-Gly motif together with the basic molecular surface form a putative RNA binding surface. Interestingly, a notable acidic surface involving acidic amino acids Asp56, Asp57, Glu60, Glu63 and Glu67 is found next to a small hydrophobic patch, which is formed by Ile28, Ile33 and Leu61 (Figure 3B). Among these residues, Ile28, Ile33, Asp56, Glu60 and Leu61 are conserved within the bacterial members of UFP0044. These molecular surfaces can be used for specific protein-protein interactions. The three dimensional structure of a given protein target may be useful to suggest the potential function; however, structural data alone is often not sufficient to define its biological function (Laskowski et al., 2003). As indicated by structural analysis, members of UFP0044 contain the necessary structural properties to interact with RNA. However, it remains to be seen if they in fact interact with RNA in a biological environment and if so, with what kind of RNA. Acknowledgement
