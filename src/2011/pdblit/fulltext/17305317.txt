ABSTRACT: The solution structures of 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 and 5-Cp-N2dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 interstrand DNA cross-links in the 5-CpG-3 sequence were determined by NMR spectroscopy. These were utilized as chemically stable surrogates for the corresponding carbinolamine interstrand cross-links arising from the crotonaldehyde- and acetaldehyde-derived R- and S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adducts. The results provide an explanation for the observation that interstrand cross-link formation in the 5-CpG-3 sequence by the R- and S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2propanodeoxyguanosine adducts is dependent upon stereochemistry, favoring the R-R-CH3--OH-1,N2propanodeoxyguanosine adduct [Kozekov, I. D., Nechev, L. V., Moseley, M. S., Harris, C. M., Rizzo, C. J., Stone, M. P., and Harris, T. M. (2003) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 50-61]. Molecular dynamics calculations, restrained by NOE-based distances and empirical restraints, revealed that both the 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 and 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-links were located in the minor groove and retained Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds at the tandem cross-linked C,G base pairs. However, for the 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link, the (R)-CH3 group was positioned in the center of the minor groove, whereas for the 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link, the (R)-CH3 group was positioned in the 3 direction, showing steric interference with the DNA helix. The 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link exhibited a lower thermal stability as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy as a function of temperature. The two cross-links also exhibited apparent differences in the conformation of the interstrand three-carbon cross-link, which may also contribute to the lower apparent thermodynamic stability of the 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link.

Crotonaldehyde 1, an R, -unsaturated aldehyde, is genotoxic and mutagenic in human lymphoblasts (1). It induces liver tumors in rodents (2). Michael addition of deoxyguanosine to crotonaldehyde yields the diastereomeric R- and S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propano-2-deoxyguanosine adducts 2a and 2b, respectively (Chart 1) (3-6). A second DNA adduction pathway yields paraldol-releasing DNA adducts (7), primarily N2-(3-hydroxybutylidene)-dG (8). Adducts 2a and 2b also form through the reaction of acetaldehyde, a mutagen and potential human carcinogen (9), with deoxyguanosine (6, 10). The R- and S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adducts 2a and 2b have been detected in human and rodent tissues (11-13). In humans, these probably result from various endogenous and exogenous exposures, including lipid peroxidation (11, 14, 15), exposure to tobacco smoke (16, 17), and exposure to N-nitrosopyrrolidine (18, 19).

The site-specific synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides containing cyclic adduct 2a or 2b (20-22) enabled their chemistry to be examined in duplex DNA. When adduct 2a or 2b was placed into oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes at 5-CpG-3 sequences, Kozekov et al. (23) trapped interstrand saturated three-carbon cross-links by treatment with Na(CN)BH3, corroborating the reports of Wang et al. (6, 8). Significantly, cross-linking efficiency was dependent upon the stereochemistry of the adduct, favoring R-R-CH3--OHPdG adduct 2a, as opposed to S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2b. However, both R-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2a and S-RCH3--OH-PdG adduct 2b readily formed N-terminal conjugates with the peptide KWKK (24). This implied that both adducts 2a and 2b underwent opening to the corresponding aldehydes 3a and 3b, respectively, when placed opposite dC in duplex DNA, but only aldehyde 3a efficiently formed interstrand cross-links in the 5-CpG-3 sequence. A series of stable isotope-edited NMR experiments showed that crotonaldehyde-derived adduct 2a yielded carbinolamine cross-link 5a, with the corresponding imine 6a and pyrimidopurinone 7a cross-links remaining below the level of detection at equilibrium in duplex DNA (25). Molecular modeling suggested a thermodynamic basis for this observa-

tion: the interstrand cross-link arising from the N2-(R-RCH3--OH-1,N2-propano-2)-dG adduct 2a introduced less disruption into the duplex than did that arising from the N2(S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propano-2)-dG adduct 2b, due to differing orientations of the R- and S-CH3 groups (25). Herein, solution structures of stereoisomeric reduced 5Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 and 5-CpN2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 interstrand DNA cross-links 8a and 8b in the 5-CpG-3 sequence (Chart 2) are determined by NMR spectroscopy. These are utilized as chemically stable surrogates for the carbinolamine interstrand cross-links 5a and 5b arising from the crotonaldehyde- and acetaldehyde-derived R- and S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propan-

odeoxyguanosine adducts. A similar strategy was employed by Liu et al. (26) to examine replication-coupled repair of these crotonaldehyde- and acetaldehyde-derived interstrand cross-links. These structural data explain the observation that interstrand cross-link formation in the 5-CpG-3 sequence favors N2-(R-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propano-2)-dG adduct 2a (23). Molecular dynamics calculations, restrained by NOEbased distances and empirical restraints, reveal that both cross-links 8a and 8b are located in the minor groove and retain Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds at the tandem crosslinked C,G base pairs. However, for cross-link 8a, the (R)CH3 group is positioned in the center of the minor groove, whereas for cross-link 8b, the (R)-CH3 group interferes

Cho et al. Capillary Gel Electrophoresis. Electrophoretic analyses were carried out using a Beckman P/ACE MDQ instrument system (32 Karat software, version 5.0) monitored at 260 nm on a 31.2 cm × 100 µm eCAP capillary with samples applied at 10 kV and run at 9 kV. The capillary was packed with the manufacturer's 100-R gel (for ss-DNA) using a Trisborate buffer system containing 7 M urea. Mass Spectrometry. MALDI-TOF1 mass spectra (negative ion) of modified oligodeoxynucleotides were obtained on a Voyager Elite DE instrument (Perseptive Biosystems) at the Vanderbilt Mass Spectrometry Facility using a 3-hydroxypicolinic acid matrix containing ammonium hydrogen citrate (7 mg/mL) to suppress multiple sodium and potassium adducts. Enzymatic Digestions. Enzymatic digestion was carried out in one step. The oligodeoxynucleotides (0.2-0.5 A260 units) were dissolved in 30 µL of buffer containing 10 mM TrisHCl and 10 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.0) and incubated with DNase I (8 units; Promega), snake venom phosphodiesterase I (0.02 unit; Sigma), and alkaline phosphatase (1.7 units, Escherichia coli; Sigma) at 37 °C for 90 min. The mixture was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC as described above. Adducted deoxynucleosides were identified by comparison with authentic samples on the basis of retention times, co-injection, and UV spectra. Melting Studies. Cross-linked duplex (0.5 A260 unit) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of buffer containing10 mM Na2HPO4/ NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0). The UV absorbance at 260 nm was monitored at 1 min intervals with a 1 °C/min temperature gradient. The temperature was cycled between 5 and 95 °C. The first derivative of the melting curve was used to establish the Tm values. N2-(S-3-Aminobutyl)-2-deoxyguanosine and N2-(S-3Amino-1-methylpropyl)-2-deoxyguanosine. (S)-1,3-Diaminobutane dihydrochloride (30 mg, 0.187 mmol) (28) was added to a solution of O6-(2-trimethylsilylethyl)-2-fluoro2-deoxyinosine (10 mg, 0.027 mmol), DMSO (200 µL), and diisopropylethylamine (100 µL). The mixture was stirred at 65 °C for 24 h. The volatiles were removed in vacuo with a centrifugal evaporator. The residue was dissolved in 5% acetic acid (500 µL) and stirred for 2 h at room temperature to remove the O6-protecting group. The mixture was neutralized with 1 M NaOH and purified by HPLC (gradient 1) to give an 85% combined yield of products.

sterically with the DNA helix. Cross-link 8b exhibits a lower thermal stability as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy as a function of temperature. The two cross-links also exhibit differences in the conformation of the interstrand threecarbon cross-link, which may contribute to the lower thermodynamic stability of cross-link 8b. MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligodeoxynucleotide Synthesis. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing site-specific R-CH3--OH-PdG adducts were prepared as previously described (20-22). All commercially obtained chemicals were used as received. Concentrations of the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were determined from calculated extinction coefficients at 260 nm (27). The concentrations of the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were determined from extinction coefficients of 11.3 × 104 and 11.1 × 104 cm-1, respectively, at 260 nm. HPLC. Oligodeoxynucleotide purification and analysis of enzymatic digestions were performed on a Beckman HPLC system (32 Karat software, version 3.1; pump module 125) with a diode array UV detector (module 168) monitoring at 260 nm using a Waters YMC ODS-AQ column [250 mm × 4.6 mm (inside diameter), 1.5 mL/min for analysis, and 250 mm × 10 mm (inside diameter), 5 mL/min for purification]. The mobile phase was CH3CN in 0.1 M ammonium formate (pH 7.0). Gradient 1 was a linear gradient from 1 to 10% CH3CN over 15 min, a linear gradient from 10 to 20% CH3CN over 5 min, 20% isocratic for 5 min, a linear gradient from 20 to 100% CH3CN over 3 min, 100% isocratic for 2 min, and a linear gradient from 100 to 1% CH3CN over 3 min. Gradient 2 was a linear gradient from 1 to 5% CH3CN over 5 min, a linear gradient from 5 to 9.5% CH3CN over 15 min, a linear gradient from 9.5 to 100% CH3CN over 3 min, 100% isocratic for 2 min, and a linear gradient from 100 to 1% CH3CN over 3 min.

N2-(R or S)-3-Amino-1-methylpropyl-dG-Adducted Oligodeoxynucleotide. Oligodeoxynucleotides (120 A260 units) containing (6S or 6R)-8-hydroxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrimido[1,2-a]purin-10(3H)-one (21) in 100 µL of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 100 µL of ammonium hydroxide were incubated at room temperature for 24 h and then treated with NaBH4 (1.0 mg, 27.5 µmol) and stirred at room temperature for an additional 2 h. The reactions were quenched with 5% acetic acid (500 µL) and the products isolated by HPLC. For the N2-(R)-3-amino-1methylpropyl-dG-adducted oligodeoxynucleotide, 66 A260 units were purified by HPLC (gradient 1): MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis, calcd for [M - H]- 3715.7, found 3715.6. For the N2-(S)-3-amino-1-methylpropyl-dG-adducted oligodeoxynucleotide, 72 A260 units were purified: MALDITOF mass spectral analysis, calcd for [M - H]- 3715.7, found 3715.5. Synthesis of Cross-Linked Oligodeoxynucleotide Duplexes. The N2-(R or S)-3-amino-1-methylpropyl-dG-adducted oligodeoxynucleotide and its complement containing O6-(2trimethylsilylethyl)-2-fluoro-2-deoxyinosine were mixed in a plastic test tube with 300 µL of 0.05 M sodium borate buffer (pH 9). The mixture was stirred at 45-47 °C, and the reaction was monitored by HPLC and CGE. The reaction times were 2 days for the R-isomer and 5 days for the S-isomer. After the reaction was complete, 5% acetic acid (500 µL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The cross-linked oligodeoxynucleotides were purified by HPLC and desalted on Sephadex G-25. For 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8a, 62 A260 units were purified by HPLC: MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, calcd for [M - H]- 7346.6, found 7349.4. For 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8b, 52 A260 units were purified by HPLC (gradient 2): MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, calcd for [M - H]7346.6, found 7345.1. NMR. Experiments were carried out at 1H frequencies of 500.13, 600.13, and 800.19 MHz. The duplex oligodeoxynucleotides were prepared at a concentration of 2 mM in 0.25 mL of 99.996% D2O. The samples contained 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0). The samples were placed into micro-NMR tubes (Shigemi Glass, Inc., Allison Park, PA). 1H NOESY experiments in D2O were conducted at 30 °C. For each t1 increment, 32 scans were averaged with presaturation of the HDO resonance. To derive distance restraints, spectra were recorded consecutively using TPPI phase cycling with mixing times of 60, 150, 250, and 350 ms. These were recorded with 2048 complex points in the acquisition dimension and 1024 real data points in the indirect dimension covering 9615.385 Hz. The relaxation delay was 2 s. The data in the d2 dimension were zero-filled to give a matrix of 2K × 2K real points. NOESY spectra for observation of exchangeable protons were recorded at 13 °C, in a 9:1 H2O/D2O mixture, using a field gradient Watergate pulse sequence (29) for water suppression. The spectra, consisting of 128 transients, were obtained with a

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 10, 2007 2611 cryogenic probe using States-TPPI phase cycling with mixing times of 200 and 250 ms. A squared sine bell with a 72° shift apodization was applied in the d1 dimension, while cosine-squared bell apodization was applied in the d2 dimension. A total of 1536 real data points in the d1 dimension and 512 points in the d2 dimension were acquired. Double-quantum-filtered 1H correlation (DQF-COSY) spectra (30, 31) were collected at 30 °C with 2048 complex points in the acquisition dimension and 512 points in the d2 dimension covering 6009.615 Hz and zero-filled to 1024 points to give a matrix of 1024 × 2048 real points. For each d1 increment, 64 or 84 transients were averaged with presaturation of the HDO resonance. A squared sine-bell apodization function was applied in both dimensions. Chemical shifts of proton resonances were referenced to water. NMR data were processed on Silicon Graphics Octane workstations using NMRPipe (32) and assigned using FELIX2000 (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). Experimental Distance Restraints. Footprints were drawn around cross-peaks for the NOESY spectrum measured at a mixing time of 250 ms to define the size and shape of individual cross-peaks, using FELIX2000. Identical footprints were transferred and fit to the cross-peaks obtained at the other two mixing times. Cross-peak intensities were determined by volume integration of the areas under the footprints. The intensities were combined with intensities generated from complete relaxation matrix analysis of a starting DNA structure to generate a hybrid intensity matrix (33). MARDIGRAS (version 5.2) (34, 35) was used to refine the hybrid matrix by iteration to optimize the agreement between the calculated and experimental NOE intensities. The molecular motion was assumed to be isotropic. The noise level was set at the intensity of the weakest cross-peak. Calculations were performed using the DNA starting models generated using INSIGHT II (Accelrys, Inc.), and NOE intensities were derived from experiments at three mixing times, and with three c values (2, 3, and 4 ns), yielding 18 sets of distances. Analysis of these data yielded the experimental distance restraints and standard deviations for the distance restraints used in subsequent restrained molecular dynamics calculations. For partially overlapped cross-peaks, the upper bounds on the distances were increased. Restrained Molecular Dynamics. Calculations were performed on Silicon Graphics Octane workstations using AMBER 8.0 (36). Classical A-DNA and B-DNA structures were used as reference structures to create starting structures for potential energy minimization (37). The reduced crosslinks were constructed between X7 and Y19 using the BUILDER module of INSIGHT II (Accelrys, Inc.). ANTECHAMBER was used, and the atom types were based on AMBER atom types for parametrization. RESP atomic charges were calculated using GAUSSIAN98 (38) and the Hartree-Fock 6-31G* basis set. Initially constructed A- and B-DNA starting structures were energy-minimized by the conjugate gradient method for 250 iterations using the AMBER 8.0 force field to relieve poor van der Walls contacts. This energy minimization used a constant dielectric without experimental restraints. The restraint energy function included terms describing distance restraints as square-well potentials. The generalized Born solvent model was used for rMD simulated annealing calculations with a salt concentration of 0.1 M, and the SHAKE algorithm was used (39, 40).

2612 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 10, 2007 The van der Waals energy term used the Lennard-Jones potential energy function. The electrostatic term used the Coulomb function, based on a full set of partial charges (-1 per residue) and a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4r. The nonbonded pair list was updated if any atom moved more than 0.5 Å, and the cutoff radius for nonbonded interactions was 15 Å. The effective energy function included terms describing distance restraints, in the form of squarewell potentials. The partial charges assigned to the adduct by RESP protocol are shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. Calculations were initiated by coupling to a heating bath, with a target temperature of 600 K. The force constants were 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 for empirical hydrogen bonding and class 1 NOE restraints and 45, 40, 35, and 30 kcal mol-1 Å-2 for classes 2-5, respectively. Those force constants were increased 1.5 times during the first 3 ps of heating and reduced to the original values during the rest of the calculations. The target temperature was reached and maintained for 5 ps. The molecules were cooled to 100 K over 12 ps for equilibrium dynamics. During the final 8 ps, the temperature was reduced to 0 K. Coordinate sets were archived every 0.2 ps, and 10 structures from the last 5 ps were averaged in total. An average structure was subjected to 500 iterations of conjugate gradient energy minimization to obtain the final structure. Back-calculation of theoretical NMR intensities from the emergent structures was performed using CORMA (version 5.2) (33). Helicoidal parameters were examined using 3DNA (41). RESULTS Synthesis of Interstrand Cross-Links 8a and 8b Arising from R- and S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-Propano-2-deoxyguanosine Adducts in the 5-CpG-3 DNA Sequence. Dooley et al. (42) synthesized trimethylene interstrand cross-links of the type N2-dG-(CH2)3-N2-dG using a postoligomerization approach (Scheme 1). This involved the incorporation of O6protected 2-fluorohypoxanthine into an oligodeoxynucleotide and its complement at the desired sites for cross-link formation. 1,3-Diaminopropane was reacted with one of the oligodeoxynucleotides, giving the N2-(3-aminopropyl)-dGadducted oligodeoxynucleotide. After purification, this oligodeoxynucleotide was reacted with its complementary strand containing an O6-protected 2-fluorohypoxanthine to give the cross-linked oligodeoxynucleotide. To prepare the reduced crotonaldehyde cross-links using this strategy, (R)and (S)-1,3-diaminobutane were required (28). This diamine is unsymmetrical; thus, it was critical that the initial adduction reaction with the diamine proceed with high regioselectivity. Lao and Hecht (10) reported the application of this strategy. We found that the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of (R)-1,3-diaminobutane with excess O6-(2-trimethylsilylethyl)-2-fluoroinosine nucleoside gave a 92:8 regiochemical mixture of products (Scheme 1). Consequently, an alternative strategy that would not give such a product mixture was pursued, starting with the stereochemically pure oligodeoxynucleotides containing crotonaldehyde adducts 2a and 2b (Scheme 2) (25). Reductive amination with ammonia and NaBH4 gave the desired N2-[3-amino-(1R)-methylpropyl]adducted oligodeoxynucleotides. Condensation with a complementary oligodeoxynucleotide containing 2-fluorohypoxanthine gave the stereo- and regiochemically pure cross-linked

Assignments of Exchangeable DNA Protons. (a) 5-CpN2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 Cross-Linked Adduct 8a. Figure 3A shows the resonances arising from the Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded imino protons. The complete sequential NOE connectivity was observed between imino protons except at the terminal bases. The latter resonances were not observed due to rapid exchange with solvent. The imino resonance arising from the C6,Y19 base pair was assigned at 12.6 ppm; the X7,C18 base pair was assigned at 12.5 ppm. Each imino proton exhibited a strong NOE to an amino proton and that of the opposite cytosine. Further, four strong A,T base parings were present, as evidenced by NOEs between thymine N3H protons and adenine H2 protons. These arose from T3,A22, A4,T21, A8, T17, and T10,A15 base pairs. As shown in Figure 4A, X7 N1H exhibited strong NOEs to C18 N4Ha, the complementary nucleotide, and X7 N2H. It showed weak NOE cross-peaks to C6 N4Ha and Y19 N2H. In contrast, Y19 N1H displayed strong NOEs to C6 N4Ha and Y19 N2H and weak cross-peaks to C18 N4Ha and X7 N2H. A similar pattern of NOE intensities was observed from X7 N1H and Y19 N1H to C18 N4Hb and C6 N4Hb. In addition, X7 N1H exhibited a NOE to A8 H2 and T17 CH3. The methyl protons of the cross-link had a stronger NOE to X7 N1H than to Y19 N1H. The H protons exhibited weak NOEs to X7 N1H, whereas HR exhibited NOEs to both X7 N1H and Y19 N1H. (b) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 CrossLinked Adduct 8b. Figure 3B shows the resonances arising from the Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded imino protons. The complete sequential NOE connectivity was observed between imino protons of the duplex except at the terminal bases. The latter resonances were not observed due to rapid exchange with solvent. The imino resonance arising from the C6,Y19 base pair was assigned at 12.5 ppm; the X7,C18 base pair was assigned at 12.3 ppm. Each imino proton exhibited a strong NOE to the corresponding Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded amino proton and to the hydrogen-bonded amino proton of the complementary cytosine, as shown in Figure 4B. Further, four strong A,T base parings were present, as evidenced by NOEs between thymine N3H protons and adenine H2 protons. These arose from T3,A22, A4,T21, A8,T17, and T10,A15 base pairs. Additional NOEs were observable with a pattern similar to that of the 5-Cp-N2dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-linked adduct. The HR proton and methyl protons exhibited stronger crosspeaks to X7 N1H than to Y19 N1H. On the other hand, the H and H protons exhibited stronger cross-peaks to Y19 N1H than to X7 N1H. Assignments of the Cross-Link Protons. (a) 5-Cp-N2-dG3-R-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 Cross-Linked Adduct 8a. All cross-link protons were assigned (Figure 5A) from a combination of 1H COSY and NOESY experiments. The CH3 resonance was observed at 1.03 ppm. It exhibited a COSY cross-peak to a resonance at 3.82 ppm, assigned as the HR resonance. The HR proton manifested an additional crosspeak to a resonance at 1.82 ppm, assigned as that arising

oligodeoxynucleotides containing cross-links 8a and 8b, respectively, in the 5-CpG-3 sequence, as a function of temperature. For both oligodeoxynucleotides, the N3 imino resonances for T3, T10, T17, and T21 broadened and disappeared at temperatures above 50 °C, whereas the N1 imino resonances for X7 and Y19 were observed at higher temperatures, consistent with the location of the cross-link among these bases. For cross-link 8a with R-stereochemistry, the X7 and Y19 imino resonances remained observable at 73 °C (Figure 1A). In contrast, for cross-link 8b with S-stereochemistry, the X7 and Y19 imino proton resonances broadened and disappeared at this temperature (Figure 1B). Assignments of Nonexchangeable DNA Protons. (a) 5Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 Cross-Linked Adduct 8a. As shown in panels A and B of Figure 2, the complete sequential connectivity between the aromatic and anomeric protons for both strands was accomplished (43, 44). An overlap occurred for the C6 and X7 H1 resonances. The completion of the NOESY walk was indicative of a stable and ordered DNA conformation. These assignments were expanded into other regions of the spectrum to yield complete 1H assignments for the H2, H2, H3, and H4 protons. The assignments of Y19 H2 and H2 were reversed compared to those of other deoxyriboses. Table S1 of the Supporting Information details the assignments of the nonexchangeable protons. (b) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 CrossLinked Adduct 8b. As shown in panels C and D of Figure 2, the complete sequential connectivity between the aromatic and the anomeric protons for both strands was accomplished (43, 44). The chemical shifts for X7 H1, A8 H1, C18 H1, and Y19 H1 differed from those observed in the cross-link having R-(R)-CH3 stereochemistry. Separate resonances were observed for C6 H1 at 5.49 ppm and X7 H1 at 5.78 ppm. The completion of NOESY walk was indicative of a stable and ordered DNA conformation. These assignments were expanded into other regions of the 1H NOESY spectrum to yield complete 1H assignments for the H2, H2, H3, and H4 protons. The assignments of Y19 H2 and H2 were

from the H 1 proton.2 The H 1 proton had a strong geminal coupling to a resonance at 1.63 ppm, arising from H 2, and weak coupling to a resonance at 2.82 ppm, arising from H2. The H2 proton also had a strong geminal coupling to the H1 proton at 3.71 ppm. The H2 and HR protons were the most deshielded, presumably due to the trans orientation with respect to the hydrogen-bonded N2H group of deoxygua2 The enantiotopic protons at C and C are designated as follows.

nosines. All of the anticipated dipolar couplings were observed to other cross-linked protons. (b) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 CrossLinked Adduct 8b. All adduct protons were assigned (Figure 5B) from a combination of 1H COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments. The H 1 f H 2 and H1 f H2 geminal couplings exhibited strong DQF-COSY cross-peaks, as did the CH3 f HR cross-peak. Different chemical shifts were observed as compared to the cross-link with R-stereochemistry (Table 1). A major difference was the differential chemical shifts of the H protons. The H 1 proton was observed at 1.09 ppm, while H 2 was observed at 2.77 ppm. Also, HR shifted upfield compared to its position in the crosslink with R-stereochemistry. Cross-Link-DNA NOEs. (a) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 Cross-Linked Adduct 8a. The CH3 protons of the cross-link exhibited strong NOEs to A8 H2 and A8 H1 (Figure 6A). The CH3 protons exhibited weaker NOEs to X7 H1 and C20 H1, and A8 H2 and H4. The H1 and H2 protons exhibited stronger NOEs to C20 H1 as compared to the H 1, H 2, and HR protons. Weak NOEs were observed between HR and A8 H1 and X7 H1. Overall, this pattern of NOE intensities positioned the methyl group in the 3 direction with respect to X7. (b) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 CrossLinked Adduct 8b. Figure 6B presents correlations among base protons in base pairs X7,C18 and C6,Y19, including NOEs to adduct protons. The CH3 protons exhibited an intense NOE to A8 H1 and strong NOEs to A8 H2 and H4. Weaker NOEs were observed from the CH3 protons to X7 H1, X7 H4, A8 H3, and C20 H1. Strong cross-peaks were observed between HR and H1 and C20 H1. This pattern of NOEs suggested that the CH3 group was oriented toward the 3 direction with respect to nucleotide X7, proximate to A8 H1 in the minor groove.

Chemical Shift Perturbations. (a) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 Cross-Linked Adduct 8a. Figure S1 (panels A and B) of the Supporting Information compares the chemical shifts of the deoxyribose protons of the crosslinked duplex with those of the corresponding non-crosslinked duplex. The greatest changes were localized to the 5 neighbor cytosine and X7 H2 proton. The other chemical shift perturbations of the base protons were consistently less than 0.1 ppm. The C6 H1 and C18 H1 protons each shifted upfield by approximately 0.05 ppm, whereas the X7 H1 and Y19 H1 protons were deshielded by approximately 0.02 ppm. These perturbations were similar to those observed for the propyl interstrand cross-link (42). (b) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 CrossLinked Adduct 8b. Figure S1 (panels C and D) of the Supporting Information compares the chemical shifts of the deoxyribose protons of the cross-linked duplex with those of the corresponding non-cross-linked duplex. The greatest changes were localized to the 5 neighbor cytosine and X7

H2. The largest difference was approximately 0.7 ppm for the 5 neighbor C6 H2. The other chemical shift perturbations of the base protons were consistently less than 0.2 ppm. The C6 H1 and C18 H1 protons each shifted upfield by approximately 0.05 ppm, whereas the X7 H1 and Y19 H1 protons were deshielded by approximately 0.02 ppm. These chemical shift perturbations were similar to those observed for the propyl interstrand cross-link (42). Torsion Angles. (a) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5Cp-N2-dG-3 Cross-Linked Adduct 8a. The NOE data suggested that all of the glycosyl torsion angles were in the anti conformation. Deoxyribose pseudorotations were estimated from 3JHH coupling constants (45). The 3JH1-H2 and 3JH1-H2' coupling constants were measured from E-COSY experiments (46), while the 3JH2-H3 and 3JH3-H4 coupling constants were determined from DQF-COSY experiments. The data were fit to curves relating the coupling constants to the pseudorotation (P), sugar pucker amplitude (), and the percentage S-type conformation. The pseudorotation and amplitude ranges were converted to the five dihedral angles 0-4 (47). The data were consistent with all deoxyribose pseudorotations being in the C2-endo range. The 31P spectrum exhibited no unusual chemical shifts, suggesting that the backbone was not perturbed. (b) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 CrossLinked Adduct 8b. The NOE data suggested that all of the glycosyl torsion angles were in the anti conformation and the deoxyribose sugars were in the C2-endo conformation (47). The 31P spectrum exhibited no unusual chemical shifts, suggesting that the backbone was not perturbed.

Structural Refinement. (a) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 Cross-Linked Adduct 8a. A-Form and B-form DNA starting structures were constructed, with the cross-link between X7 and Y19. The cross-link was parametrized for AMBER 8.0 as shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. A total of 246 distance restraints were generated from the NOE data using MARDIGRAS (34, 48). In addition, 52 empirical Watson-Crick restraints were incorporated in rMD calculations. The precision of the rMD calculations was monitored by pairwise rmsd analysis of the emergent structures. Figure S3 (panel A) of the Supporting Information shows a stereoview of structures emerging from the rMD calculations. The rmsd between the A-DNA and B-DNA starting structures was 6.4 Å. The pairwise rmsd between averaged structures from IniA and IniB was 1.4 Å. The final refined structure was compared to the starting A-DNA and B-DNA structures. It exhibited a rmsd of 2.6 Å to the B-DNA starting structure and a rmsd of 4.3 Å to the A-DNA starting structure. This indicated that the convergent structures more closely resembled B-DNA than A-DNA. Detailed results are listed in Table 2.

matrix analysis, using CORMA. Figure S4 (panels A and B) of the Supporting Information presents sixth-root R1x residuals at each nucleotide, in comparison with experimental NOE data obtained with a mixing time of 150 ms.

The overall intranucleotide R1x residual was 6.47 × 10-2, and the overall internucleotide R1x residual was 7.72 × 10-2. These values indicated agreement between the refined structures and the NOESY data. (b) 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 CrossLinked Adduct 8b. A-Form and B-form DNA starting structures were constructed, as described above for crosslinked adduct 8a. A total of 364 distance restraints were generated from the NOE data using MARDIGRAS (34, 48). A total of 52 empirical Watson-Crick restraints were incorporated in rMD calculations. Figure S3 (panel B) of the Supporting Information shows a stereoview of convergent structures emerging from the rMD calculations. The rmsd between A-DNA and B-DNA starting structures was 6.4 Å. The pairwise rmsd between averaged structures as compared to the initial A- and B-DNA starting structures was 1.6 Å. The final averaged and energyminimized structure was compared to the starting structure; a 2.5 Å rmsd was observed between the initial B-form starting structure and rMDavg, while a 4.3 Å rmsd was observed between the initial A-form starting structure and rMDavg.

These values indicated agreement between the refined structures and the NOESY data. Structure of 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2dG-3 Cross-Linked Adduct 8a. Figure 7A shows the refined structure of the interstrand cross-link from the minor groove. The R-(R)-CH3 group is oriented in the 3 direction with respect to X7. It faced toward T17 in the complementary strand and was centered within the minor groove. This allowed the R-(R)-CH3 group to be easily accommodated within the minor groove. It also allowed the cross-linked oligodeoxynucleotide to maintain Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds and normal base stacking interactions at the tandem cross-linked C6,Y19 and X7,C18 base pairs (Figure 8A). The conformation of the propyl group is shown in a Newman projection in Figure 9A. At the CR-C bond, HR was trans to H 1 and gauche with respect to H 2, consistent with the large HR f H 1 3J coupling constant and the smaller HR f H 2 3J coupling constant. At the C -C bond, H2 was trans to H 1 and gauche with respect to H 2, consistent with the large H2 f H 1 3J coupling constant and the smaller H2 f H 2 3J coupling constant.

respect to X7. It faced toward A8 and was within the minor groove. This created a clash between the CH3 group and the right-handed helical trajectory of the minor groove, as predicted by modeling studies (25). Nevertheless, the cross-

2618 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 10, 2007 linked oligodeoxynucleotide maintained Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds and reasonable base stacking at the tandem cross-linked C6,Y19 and X7,C18 base pairs, shown in Figure 8B. The conformation of the propyl group is shown in a Newman projection in Figure 9B. At the CR-C bond, H1 was trans to H 2 and gauche with respect to H 1, consistent with the large H1 f H 2 3J coupling constant and the smaller observed H1 f H 1 3J coupling constant. At the C -C bond, HR was trans to H 2 and gauche with respect to H 1, consistent with the large HR f H 2 3J coupling constant and the smaller HR f H 1 3J coupling constant. Consequently, the protons of the propyl cross-link were oriented differently than in the corresponding cross-link with R-stereochemistry of the CH3 group, consistent with their differential chemical shifts in the two stereoisomeric cross-links (Figure 5). DISCUSSION 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 and 5Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-links 8a and 8b provided chemically stable surrogates for carbinolamine cross-links 5a and 5b arising from the crotonaldehydeand acetaldehyde-derived R- and S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adducts 2a and 2b, respectively, in duplex DNA (25). Structural studies on reduced cross-links 8a and 8b provided an opportunity to search for an explanation to the observation that interstrand cross-link formation in the 5-CpG-3 sequence is dependent upon adduct stereochemistry, favoring the R-R-CH3--OH-1,N2propanodeoxyguanosine adduct 2a. Structures of 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2dG-3 and 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG3 Cross-Links 8a and 8b, RespectiVely. The results reveal that 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 crosslink 8a is thermodynamically more stable than 5-Cp-N2dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8b. While both cross-links were accommodated within the minor groove of the duplex, with small distortions of DNA structure, the Tm of 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 crosslink 8b was lower (Figure 1). The differential melting of the two cross-links correlates specifically with the tandem cross-linked C6,Y19 and X7,C18 base pairs. The WatsonCrick hydrogen bonding of these two base pairs is more thermally stable in 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-CpN2-dG-3 cross-link 8a than in 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8b. The structural studies suggest that the differential thermal stabilities of the two cross-links are due to stereospecific differences in the conformation of the (R)-CH3 group. For 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8a, the (R)-CH3 group was oriented in the 3 direction within the minor groove and did not interfere with the right-handed geometry of the minor groove. In contrast, the 3 orientation of the R-CH3 group for cross-link 8b did interfere at X7 and A8 with the right-handed geometry of the minor groove. This necessitated the conformational reorganization of cross-link 8b as compared to cross-link 8a, with the (R)-CH3 group placed as far as possible from the floor of the minor groove at X7. The differential patterns of 3J coupling constants in the 1H NMR spectra corroborated the differential conformations of the three-carbon cross-links. For 5-Cp-N2-dG-3R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8a, the H 1 f

Cho et al. H2 and HR f H 1 cross-peaks exhibited large 3J coupling constants consistent with their trans orientation. In addition, for cross-link 8b, the H 2 f H1 and HR f H 2 cross-peaks exhibited large 3J coupling constants consistent with their trans orientation. Likewise, the different chemical shifts of the propyl protons in the stereoisomeric cross-links were consistent with the conclusion that the corresponding protons in the two cross-links were in different environments. Molecular modeling had predicted that carbinolamine cross-links 5a and 5b, with sp3 hybridization at the -carbon, allowed the tandem cross-linked C6,Y19 and X7,C18 base pairs to maintain Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding (25). In contrast, dehydration of the carbinolamine to the imine (Schiff base) cross-link would result in sp2 hybridization and loss of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding. 5-Cp-N2-dG-3R-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8a and 5-CpN2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8b lack the -OH group present in the native cross-links. However, it may be inferred from the results presented here that the sp3 hybridization at the -carbon of the cross-link does allow the exocyclic amine proton at Y19 to participate in Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding, with minimal perturbation of the DNA duplex, irrespective of R- versus Sstereochemistry at the (R)-CH3 group (Figure 8). In both reduced cross-links 8a and 8b, the exocyclic amine protons at both X7 and Y19 were observed in the NMR spectra, and for both reduced cross-links 8a and 8b, the exocyclic amine protons at both X7 and Y19 exhibited NOEs to the corresponding X7 N1H and Y19 N1H imino protons, consistent with the conclusion that they were participating in hydrogen bonds. This is indicative of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds at both C6,Y19 and X7,C18 base pairs, for both reduced crosslinks 8a and 8b. This is consistent with studies of other N2dG adducts such as those arising from mitomycin C, anthramycin, and benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxides that leave the deoxyguanosine exocyclic amine proton available to participate in Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding (50-52). Comparison with the 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-Propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG3 Cross-Link. A similar strategy was used by Dooley et al. (42, 53) to examine the reduced 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-propyl-5Cp-N2-dG-3 and 5-N2-dGpC-3-propyl-5-N2-dGpC-3 crosslinks in the 5-CpG-3 versus 5-GpC-3 sequences. In the 5-CpG-3 sequence, the structure of Dooley et al. (42) differed from those of the 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)-CH3-propyl5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8a and 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-S-(R)-CH3propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8b reported herein. In the 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link, their threecarbon cross-link was accommodated by unwinding of the duplex at the cross-linked base pairs to produce a bulge. The tethered guanines were approximately in the same plane. Consequently, Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding was disrupted at the tandem cross-linked base pairs. The formation of a bulge accommodated the extended chain conformation of the linker between the two deoxyguanosines in the 5CpG-3 sequence. In the extended chain conformation, the exocyclic nitrogens of each deoxyguanosine were in an anti orientation with respect to their respective -carbon atoms of the propyl cross-link (42). For the 5-Cp-N2-dG-3-R-(R)CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8a and 5-Cp-N2-dG3-S-(R)-CH3-propyl-5-Cp-N2-dG-3 cross-link 8b, the exocyclic nitrogens of each deoxyguanosine were instead in the gauche orientation with respect to their respective -carbon

Crotonaldehyde Interstrand DNA Cross-Link Structure atoms of the propyl cross-link (Figure 9). Molecular modeling suggested that the presence of either stereoisomer of the (R)-CH3 group created steric strain in the extended chain conformation, which may explain the observed gauche orientation of the exocyclic nitrogens of each deoxyguanosine with respect to their respective -carbon atoms in the crotonaldehyde-derived cross-links. Kinetics of Interstrand Cross-Link Formation by the Rand S-R-CH3--OH-PdG Adducts (2a and 2b, respectiVely). In addition to being energetically disfavored with respect to the interstrand cross-link formed by R-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2a, the rate of cross-link formation by S-R-CH3-OH-PdG adduct 2b is slower. Twenty days after annealing 5-d(GCTAGCXAGTCC)-3,5-d(GGACTCYCTAGC)-3 (X ) R- or S-a-CH3--13C-OH-PdG; Y ) 15N2-dG) at pH 7 and 37 °C, spectroscopically detectable amounts of an interstrand carbinolamine cross-link were observed only for R-R-CH3-OH-PdG adduct 2a (25). However, treatment of the oligodeoxynucleotide containing S-a-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2b with NaCNBH3 successfully trapped the reduced interstrand cross-link 8b (23), suggesting that imine cross-link 6b was in fact present, below the level of NMR detection. Subsequent 13C HSQC NMR studies, in which the sample was monitored at 37 °C for 70 days, revealed the presence of interstrand 5-CpG-3 carbinolamine cross-link 5b derived from S-R-CH3--13C-OH-PdG adduct 2b. Thus, at pH 7 and 37 °C, 20 days was not sufficient to allow the duplex containing S-R-CH3--13C-OH-PdG adduct 2b to reach equilibrium. Previous studies revealed a structural basis for the slow rate of interstrand cross-link formation by S-R-CH3--OHPdG adduct 2b (54). Within the minor groove, the aldehyde moiety of adduct 3b is oriented in the 3 direction, while the 1(S)-methyl group is oriented in the 5 direction. This positioned the aldehyde distal to the G19 amino group, hindering formation of the 5-CpG-3 interstrand cross-link (54). Thus, we conclude that the formation of interstrand cross-links by N2-(S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propano-2)-dG adduct 2b is not only energetically disfavored but also kinetically disfavored. Both the energetics and the kinetics of cross-link formation are modulated by stereochemistry at the (R)-CH3 group. Biological Implications. The crotonaldehyde- and acetaldehyde-derived R- and S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adducts 2a and 2b have both been isolated from mammalian tissues, including human cells (11-13). Both are thought to contribute to the etiology of human mutagenesis and cancer. When DNA containing adducts 2a and 2b was introduced into human xeroderma pigmentosum A (XPA) cells and examined with respect to replication (55), the major miscoding events in the XPA cells for both adducts were G f T transversions, with G f A transitions also being observed for adduct 2a, whereas G f C transversions were the second most common events for adduct 2b. The sitespecific mutagenesis of adducts 2a and 2b has also been examined in COS-7 cells, also showing primarily G f T transversions (56). It is generally thought that the propensity of cyclic adducts 2a or 2b to undergo ring opening to N2(3-oxopropyl)-dG aldehydes 3a and 3b (Chart 1) facilitates lesion bypass, as reported for the acrolein-derived -OHPdG adduct (57-61). On the other hand, in duplex DNA, incomplete conversion of crotonaldehyde-derived adducts 2a

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 10, 2007 2619 and 2b to aldehydes 3a and 3b or hydrated aldehydes 4a and 4b, respectively, may block DNA replication, possibly reducing their mutagenicity. The formation of interstrand carbinolamine cross-link 5a by R-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct 2a might also block DNA replication, and thus reduce its mutagenicity as compared to that of S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct 2b. The equilibrium chemistry of adducts 2a and 2b and, in particular, the chemical stability of carbinolamine cross-link 5a (Chart 1), within DNA replication or repair complexes, are of considerable interest; Liu et al. (26) report that cross-links 5a and 5b were stable during construction of site-specifically modified plasmids but concluded that in E. coli, proficient nucleotide excision repair was absolutely required to repair cross-link 8a. Thus, E. coli transformants obtained using cross-links 5a and 5b were interpreted as arising from some proportion of native cross-links that had reverted to the respective monoadducts. However, in nucleotide excision repair-deficient human XPA cells, residual repair of cross-link 8a was observed (26), which suggested the presence of a replication-coupled NER-independent crosslink repair pathway (62), e.g., the proposed ERCC1-XPF endonuclease replication fork cross-link repair pathway (63, 64). In XPA cells, the primary mutations induced as a consequence of error-prone repair of reduced cross-link 8a were low levels of G f T transversions targeting the crosslinked dG in the lagging strand template (26). The specific polymerases responsible for trans-lesion synthesis remain to be identified, but Y-family polymerase  (65) and pol (66, 67) are candidates. Washington et al. (68, 69) showed that Y-polymerase pol  in conjunction with pol , or Rev 1 in combination with pol , could efficiently bypass the acroleinderived -OH-PdG adduct. Minko et al. (70) showed that pol  could bypass the -OH-PdG adduct to a lesser extent. It seems plausible that these error-prone polymerases might also bypass equilibrium mixtures of crotonaldehyde- and acetaldehyde-derived monoadducts 2a, 3a, and 4a or 2b, 3b, and 4b or partially excised intermediates arising from replication-coupled repair of interstrand cross-links 5a and 5b.
