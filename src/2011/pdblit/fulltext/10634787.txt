Crystal Structure of a T Cell Receptor Ligand T22: A Truncated MHC-Like Fold
Christer Wingren,1* Michael P. Crowley,2 Massimo Degano,1 Yueh-hsiu Chien,2 Ian A. Wilson1§
Murine T10 and T22 are highly related nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib proteins that bind to certain T cell receptors (TCRs) in the absence of other components. The crystal structure of T22b at 3.1 angstroms reveals similarities to MHC class I molecules, but one side of the normal peptide-binding groove is severely truncated, which allows direct access to the -sheet floor. Potential TCR-binding sites can be inferred from functional mapping of T10 and T22 point mutants and allelic variants. Thus, T22 represents an unusual variant of the MHC-like fold and indicates that and TCRs interact differently with their respective MHC ligands. Classical MHC class I (class Ia) molecules participate in immune responses by presenting peptide antigens to cytolytic T cells (1). Many nonclassical MHC class I (class Ib) molecules have distinct antigen-binding capabilities, suggesting that they have evolved for specific tasks that are distinct from those of MHC class Ia (2). Although the majority of cells that respond to class Ib ligands express the TCR, the murine H-2T­ encoded T22 and the closely related T10 (94% sequence identity) have been identified as specific ligands for two T cell clones, G8 and KN6 (3­5). Recognition of T22 and T10 by G8 T cells is fundamentally different from MHC T cells (4 ­ 6). class Ia recognition by Whereas the MHC class Ia­peptide interaction is essential for both pMHC cell surface stability (7) and T cell recognition (1), T22 and T10 do not appear to require peptide or any other ligand for cell surface expression or recognition by T cells (4 ­ 6). Recognition and stimulation are dependent only on a properly folded and stable heterodimer association of the T22 or T10 heavy chain with 2-microglobulin ( 2M) (4, 6). Escherichia coli­produced T22 and T10 can be refolded in vitro with 2M to form a stable het1 Department of Molecular Biology and the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. 2Program of Immunology and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

erodimer in the absence of peptide (6). The primary sequences of T22 and T10 suggested that the necessary structural features to bind peptide are absent because of a three­ amino acid deletion within the 1 domain, a 13-residue deletion in 2 (3), and substitution

of four of the eight amino acids that are key for peptide binding by class Ia molecules (8). These sequence and structural differences are not shared by other nonclassical and MHC-like molecules, such as CD1 (9), H-2M3 (9), Zn2-glycoprotein (ZAG) (10), MIC-A (11), hemochromatosis protein HFE (9), and the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) (9). However, these molecules all have modified binding grooves, which are structurally distinct from class Ia proteins, in order to bind alternate ligands such as formylated peptides, glycolipids, and intact proteins (9 ­11). Nevertheless, by comparison, T10 and T22 represent an unusual way for MHC-like molecules to adopt a peptide- or ligand-free structure yet still function in the immune system. T22 mRNA is expressed by many different cell types in a great variety of tissues similar to MHC class Ia, whereas T10 mRNA is detectable only in cells of the immune system (3). Recently, T10 and T22 were demonstrated to be cell activation markers, and a population of T10- and T22-specific T cells was identified in normal mice (12). Thus, changes in the level of T10 or T22 expression on cells may act as a trigger for an

Crystals were obtained by mixing purified T22b at 13 mg/ml with 0.1 M imidazole-maleate (pH 5.0), 0.2 M calcium acetate, and 10% PEG8000 (34). The crystals are orthorhombic P21212 (a 167.1 Å, b 91.5 Å, c 122.5Å) with four molecules in the asymmetric unit and a Vm of 2.78 Å3/dalton (32). Crystals were flash-cooled to 176°C with 25% glycerol as the cryoprotectant, and data were collected at beamline 9-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on a MAR image plate detector. Data were integrated and reduced with DENZO and SCALEPACK (32). The structure was determined by molecular replacement with truncated coordinates of HLA-A2 (16, 17) as the search model. Normalized structure factors from 12.0 to 4.0 Å were used in AMoRE rotation and translation functions and X-PLOR Patterson correlation refinement (Rvalue 0.47, correlation coefficient 0.54) (32). Phases to 3.1 Å were improved by solvent flattening and fourfold density averaging with DM (final average correlation 0.85) (32). The resulting electron density maps allowed unambiguous rebuilding of the molecule including some previously uninterpretable regions. Multiple rounds of slow-cooled torsion molecular dynamics refinement and model rebuilding were carried out with X-PLOR, CNS, and O (32). Rfree (32) was calculated from 3% of the unique data, and only procedures that minimized both Rcryst and Rfree were used. Tight NCS restraints were applied to all regions (rmsd 0.04 Å), except for two flexible loops involved in lattice contacts (22). The final model included 95% of all residues fitted to both averaged and unaveraged A-weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron density maps (32) and "shake" omit maps (32).

immunoregulatory T cell function (12­14). To gain further insight into the functions of T10 and T22 and to provide a structural context for understanding T cell­mediated antigen recognition, we determined the crystal structure of T22b at 3.1 Å. The murine T22b heavy chain and human 2M heterodimer (15) were produced in a soluble form in E. coli and crystallized (Table 1). The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement, with HLA-A2 (16, 17) as a search model (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Four independent copies of T22b were found in the crystal asymmetric unit. T22b adopts an overall MHC-like fold that is structurally more similar to MHC class Ia than to class II and class Ib molecules (18) (Figs. 1 and 2). The chain folds into the standard three domains ( 1, 2, and 3) that are closely associated with 2M. The relative quaternary arrangement of the 1- 2 platform, 3 domain, and 2M is within the range of orientations observed for MHC class Ia molecules (19). The total buried surface area and the number of hydrogen bonds between 2M and the heavy chain are at the lower end of the normal range (20) and may explain why the closely related T10- 2M complex is less stable to thermal denaturation than class Ia molecules (6). Although the related H-2T­ encoded T18 protein is able to bind CD8 (8), no data are available on whether T22 can bind CD8. However, most of the MHC class I heavy chain residues of the 3 domain in the CD8-binding site (16, 17) are conserved in T22b (21); the highly acidic loop in 3 is structurally similar to other class I molecules (21). The three­amino acid deletion in the 1 domain (residues 46 to 48) maps to or near the outermost strand (S4) and the long helix (H2) of class Ia molecules (9). In MHC class Ia (Fig. 1B), the 1 domain has two -helical segments, named H1 ( residues 49 to 54) and H2 ( 56 to 85) (9). T22b lacks the entire H1 segment and does not start the H2 helical structure until residue 60. Thus, the 1 H2 helix is substantially shorter in T22b (Figs. 1 and 2). The conformation of the connecting loop (residues 53 to 59) between S4 and H2 adopts slightly different conformations in the four T22b monomers, partly because of crystal lattice contacts (22) (Fig. 1). The 2 domain has the least structural resemblance to any known classical or nonclassical MHC-like molecule (18) (Fig. 2). This region also displays the greatest structural heterogeneity among nonclassical class I molecules. The 13­amino acid deletion maps to an equivalent region in the 2 domain around the outermost strand (S4), the loop preceding the first 2 helix, and the H1 helical segment of class Ia MHC (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous predictions (3). Compared with MHC class Ia molecules, T22b lacks the S4 strand; the preceding S3 strand is now connected to the H2a helical segment through an extended chain containing two type IV turns. The turns are anchored to the adjacent strand (S2) by an additional disulfide bond (Cys 110 to Cys 133) that does not occur in any other MHC class Ia or Ib structure (Fig. 1) (23). This arrangement may in part account for the COOH-terminal part of S2 being raised 1 to 3 Å compared with class Ia molecules (Figs. 1

The structures are overlapped by superimposition of the -sheet floor. The -sheet platform superimposes closely, with the exception of a few loops, whereas there are substantial differences between the helical segments. The overall average rmsd is 1.6 Å for 70 homologous C positions ( 0.51 Å for 54 C positions). The rmsd values were calculated with SUPPOS (32), and DALI (32) was used for the structure-based sequence alignment.

and 2). The conformation of the hairpin loop connecting S1 and S2 is also affected. The bulged loop region between S3 and the H2 helices adopts a less well-ordered structure (as indicated by higher than average B values) before it connects to the remnant of the 2 H2a helix; different lattice contacts in the crystal primarily account for the slightly different conformations in the four T22b monomers (22) (Fig. 1). The H2b 2 helix is conserved as in class Ia molecules (Fig. 1) (24). In MIC-A, the 2 helix segments H1 and H2b are preserved, whereas segment H2a appears to form a flexible, disordered loop region; unlike T22 and T10, MIC-A does not have deletions (11). The relative position of the 1 and 2 helical segments, as well as the curvature of the 1 H2 helix, differs substantially when compared with class Ia molecules (Fig. 2). The minimum distance between the 1 and 2 helical structures (including the loop preceding the 1 helix) is only about 6 to 10 Å (C to C ), compared with 12 to 20 Å (class Ia and II), 10 to 13 Å (FcRn), and 7 to 10 Å (MIC-A) (9, 11) for other MHC molecules. The short distance observed in T22b is mainly a result of the curved 1 helix, which is more correctly described as a shortened 1 H2 helix consisting of two segments (H2a and H2b), a feature not yet observed in class Ia molecules (9, 24). The decreased distance between the 1 and 2 helices creates many noncovalent interactions, including three hydrogen bonds that may substantially stabilize the structure in the absence of ligand. Thus, T22b adopts a severely modified MHC-like fold that lacks a classical peptidebinding groove (Figs. 1 and 3A), consistent with biological data that indicate that T22 (and T10) do not present peptide for recognition by and stimulation of T cells (4 ­ 6). Analysis of the electrostatic surface potential reveals the top of the 1 2 domains to be mainly neutral, although a negatively charged patch is present near the NH2-terminal region of the 1 H2a helix (Fig. 3A). The importance of this patch remains to be elucidated. T22b has two probable N-linked glycosylation sites at residues 86 and 150 in the 1 2 domains. The first site corresponds to the highly conserved glycosylation site in MHC class Ia molecules, also located at residue 86 (9), but the second site is located right in the middle of the protruding loop in the 2 domain (Fig. 1, C and D). Although the E. coli­produced T22b is not glycosylated, we modeled in the carbohydrates to assess their potential functional importance; carbohydrate has been shown to play a role in folding of the heterodimer in MHC class I ( 86) (25), but not to confer specificity in the T22bTCR interaction (6). However, the carbohydrate bulk may be important in guiding the T cell to its binding site. Analysis of the length distribution of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of and chains indicates more similarity to those of immunoglobulins than to TCRs (26). The structural differences between T22b and MHC class Ia molecules (Fig. 2) further support the idea that and TCRs recognize antigens differently (4, 14, 27) and that TCRs may be more like immunoglobulins in their recognition properties (4, 14, 28). Indeed, TCRs are not restricted in their choice of ligands or epitopes. LBK5 T cells recognize

Electrostatic potentials were calculated in GRASP (32); positive potential ( 15 mv) is colored blue, neutral potential (0 mv) is colored gray, and negative potential ( 15 mv) is colored red. (B) Stereoview showing potential T cell­ binding sites on the 1 2 domains of T22b. G8 and KN6 recognize T10b, T10k, and T10129 and T22b and T22129 (3, 4). T22k and T22d are not expressed on the cell surface (3, 35); thus, the following amino acid changes are tolerated: Asn59 3 Asp, Arg65 3 His, Gly100 3 Asp, Arg107 Gln, Asn127 3 Ser, His155 3 Gln, Asp159 3 His, Lys161 3 Glu, Ser162 3 Gly, and Leu167 3 Val ( yellow) (33). In contrast, neither G8 nor KN6 recognizes T10d. Antibody staining and surface immunoprecipitation indicate that this molecule is expressed on the cell surface (35). Three differences occur in T10d as compared with T10b and T22b: Arg35 3 Leu, Asp58 3 Gly, and Phe124 3 His (red). Although one of these mutations could affect the epitope for G8 and KN6, Asp58 is on the negatively charged NH2-terminal loop, whereas Phe124 is on the exposed -sheet floor. In addition, KN6 can be stimulated by mutant T22b molecules with single alanine substitutions at positions Arg6, Tyr9, Ile23, Val25, or Gln115 (green), but not at positions Leu5, Tyr7, Leu95, Leu98, or Leu116 (purple) (30). Because Tyr7 normally forms a hydrogen bond with Gln63, a mutation at this position is more likely to affect the interaction between the TCR and T22 by secondary effects, such as local disruption of the T22 structure (hence, Tyr7 is colored in green). It is also unclear whether any of these mutant proteins were expressed on the cell surface (30). The limited sequence heterogeneity between T22 and T10 is located mainly in the exposed portion of the 1 2 platform; therefore, T10 is predicted to have a closely similar fold to T22.

an epitope on MHC class II I-E , independent of bound peptide and distinct from that recognized by peptide-specific T cells (4, 27). MHC homolog MIC-A has recently been shown to interact with the NKG2D receptor on T cells, and natural most T cells, CD8 killer (NK) cells (29). Structural mapping of MIC-A sequence variations suggests that the potential binding site for the receptor is on the underside of the -sheet platform (11). To define a potential TCR-binding site on T22b, we mapped allelic sequence differences between T22 and T10 (and two allelic variants thereof ) and amino acid substitutions, whose effects on the T cell recognition and activation process are known (3, 4, 30), onto the crystal structure (Fig. 3, B and C) (31). The now exposed -sheet floor (about 19 Å by 18 Å at the widest dimensions) lies at the base of a deep, hydrophobic cavity, closed on two sides by the 1 H2b and 2 H2a helices that rise 6 to 10 Å (surface to surface) above the platform. Two potential interaction sites for the TCR are highlighted on the exposed -sheet floor and on the acidic patch at the opposite edge of the T22b surface (red arrows in Fig. 3C) (31). Several of these mutations and allelic differences cluster in a patch on the exposed floor and may be a direct contact site for a CDR loop of the TCR. Thus, the crystal structure of T22b reveals another way for the versatile MHC fold to adapt to a different function in the immune system.

Human 2M increases the stability of the expressed T10 and T22 heavy chains (6), as has been found with murine class Ia MHC H-2Kb [M. R. Jackson, E. S. Song, Y. Yang, P. A. Peterson, Proc. Natl. Acad.

The program DALI (32) was used to search for structurally similar proteins within the PDB. MHC class Ia, class Ib, and class II molecules had the highest similarity scores, as expected. The most similar MHC molecule to T22b in each MHC class in order of alignment Z score, root mean square deviations (rmsd) for C superimposition, and sequence identity is as follows: 20.6, 2.0 Å, and 56% (HLA-B8, PDB code 1agd); 18.4, 2.2 Å, and 58% (H-2M3, PDB code 1mhc); and 14.3, 4.5 Å, and 23% (IAk, PDB code 1iak). T22b and all MHC class Ia molecules available in the PDB were superpositioned on the basis of the C atoms in the -sheet floor with DALI structure-based sequence alignment (32). The total buried surface area and the number of hydrogen bonds between 2M and the heavy chain were 845 Å2 and 5 for T22b, whereas the corresponding values for five representative MHC class Ia molecules (PDB codes 1ldp, 2vaa, 1ce6, 1akj, and 2clr) (9) were 850 to 1036 Å2 and 7 to 21. HBPLUS (32) was used to calculate the number of hydrogen bonds with both distance and geometry criteria. Buried surface areas were computed with MS (32) with a 1.4 Å probe, 10.0 spot density, and standard atomic radii. CD8 is bound primarily by amino acids in the 3 domain, including a patch of relatively acidic amino acids at positions 223 to 229. The consensus sequence for these residues in HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules is DQTQDTE (33). The corresponding sequence in T22b is ELTQDME. The rmsd for T22b and four representative MHC class Ia structures (PDB codes 1akj, 2vaa, 1hoc, and 1ldp) (9) was 0.8 to 1.2 Å for residues 223 to 229 and 0.6 to 1.2 Å for residues 220 to 250. Furthermore, three residues in the 2 domain, Gln115, Asp122, and Glu128, are also of vital importance for binding of CD8 (16, 17). Again, these residues are conserved in T22b, and the rmsd for T22b and MHC class Ia was 1.9 Å for residues 115 to 128. The values for the rmsd's were calculated with SUPPOS (32). No electron density was observed for residues 135 to 140 in molecule 3, nor for the last 18 residues in the heavy chain (part of an extra 20-residue tail added for labeling purposes) in all four molecules. The following residues were truncated to alanines, because of poor electron density for their side chains: molecule 1, Lys170 and Glu254; molecule 2, His155, Lys170, and Glu254; molecule 3, Glu56, His155, Lys170, and Glu254; and molecule 4, Asn126, Lys170, and Glu254. Tight noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were applied to all regions except for two extended loop segments, residues 53 to 60 and residues 124 to 159. With molecule 2 as reference, the rmsd values for the first segment were 1.4 to 1.6 Å, and for the second segment they were 2.0 to 2.3 Å (rmsd 0.3 Å for residues 124 to 126). The differences are primarily due to unique lattice contacts for each mole-

cule and do not appear to be biologically important. The values for the rmsd's were calculated with SUPPOS (32). The two disulfide bonds ( 101 to 164 and 203 to 259) conserved in all the MHC class Ia structures are present in T22b as well. The 1 helix of MHC class Ia molecules is composed of two segments, named H1 ( residues 49 to 54) and H2 ( residues 56 to 85). T22b lacks helical segment H1. Furthermore, segment 2 is shorter (residues 60 to 86), and it may be more correct to describe it as consisting of two helical segments, residues 60 to 73 (H2a) and residues 74 to 86 (H2b). The rmsd for residues 60 to 86 is 1.4 Å between T22b and class Ia molecules (0.4 to 0.8 Å for residues 60 to 73, and 0.5 to 0.8 Å for residues 74 to 86). The 2 helix of MHC class Ia molecules is composed of three segments, named H1 ( residues 138 to 150), H2a ( residues 153 to 162), and H2b ( residues 164 to 180). T22b lacks the 2 -helical segments H1 and most of H2a, whereas the helical segment H2b runs from residues 163 to 180. The rmsd for residues 163 to 180 is 0.35 Å between T22b and class Ia molecules.

Sci. U.S.A. 90, 11396 (1993). Comparison of the sequence of T22b with that of MHC class Ia shows that residues Arg6, Tyr7, Val25, and Arg35 are highly conserved, whereas residues Leu5 and Leu98 are conservative substitutions. In T22b, Arg6 forms a salt bridge with Asp102, Tyr7 forms a hydrogen bond with Gln63 and packs with Leu5, and Arg35 forms a salt bridge with Glu40 or Asp53. Furthermore, mutation of Val25 to a larger residue (Phe) but not to a smaller residue (Ala) will cause the side chain to clash with neighboring residues. Thus, mutation of residues Leu5, Arg6, Tyr7, Val25, or Arg35 could cause some local disruption of the T22 structure. In fact, a change of Val25 3 Phe in T10b, which is found naturally in T22k, is known not to be expressed on the cell surface, whereas Arg35 3 Leu is expressed as deduced from antibody staining and immunoprecipitation ( Y. Chien, unpublished results). In addition, the Leu5 3 Ala mutant does not stimulate KN6, but the Arg6 3 Ala mutant is recognized. X-ray crystallography programs and methods: (i) CNS [A. T.

A Population of Murine T Cells That Recognize an Inducible MHC Class Ib Molecule

Although T cells are implicated in regulating immune responses, T cell­ligand pairs that could mediate such regulatory functions have not been identified. Here, the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib T22 and the closely related T10 molecules is shown to be activationinduced, and they confer specificity to about 0.4% of the T cells in normal mice. Thus, the increased expression of T22 and/or T10 might trigger immunoregulatory T cells during immune responses. Furthermore, the fast onrates and slow off-rates that characterize this receptor/ligand interaction would compensate for the low ligand stability and suggest a high threshold for T cell activation. and T cells contribute differently to host immune defense. Mice deficient in T cells generally exhibit more profound defects in the regulation of immune function than in the clearance of intracellular pathogens (1). However, neither the ligands nor a normal T cells responsible for mepopulation of diating such immunoregulatory functions have been identified in any of the systems studied. The closely related nonclassical MHC class I molecules T10 and T22 (94% amino acid identity) have been identified as ligands for two T cell clones KN6 independently isolated and G8 (2, 3). T10- 2-microglobulin ( 2M) and T22- 2M heterodimers do not bind peptide and adopt a structure distinct from that of classical MHC molecules (4, 5). Both heterodimers

are recognized directly by G8, without a requirement for other component (3, 4). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)­ or concanavalinA (conA)­activated splenocytes stimulate G8 and KN6 better than resting cells (6), implying that activation of lymphocytes results in increased expression of T10 and/or T22 on the cell surface. To monitor T10 and T22 expression and to understand its relationship to T cells, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 7H9, specific for T10 and T22 (7). The 7H9 mAb recognizes in vitro folded T10- 2M, T22- 2M proteins and stains T10 and T22 transfected cell lines [CHO-T10 and T2-T22 (8)], but not cells transfected with the MHC class I molecule Ld or the MHC class II molecule I-Ek (Fig. 1A) (9). Both T10 and T22 are recognized equally by 7H9 with a high affinity around 0.1 nM determined by surface plasmon resonance with immobilized 7H9 (9). In B10.BR (H-2k) mice in which the T22 gene is nonfunctional (10), cell surface expression of T10 was only observed if splenic cells were activated by LPS or conA. An increase in T10 expression was also observed, after antigenic stimulation, on T cells from B10.BR mice transgenic for the 5CC7 T cell receptor (TCR), which is specific for the cytochrome c­I-Ek (Fig. 1B). The induction of T10 or T22 on splenocytes, including B cells and cells other than B and T cells, has also been observed in a peripheral tolerance induction model (11, 12). Because T cells can recognize their ligands directly, without a requirement for antigen pro-

cessing and presentation, the induction of T10 and T22 on the cell surface of lymphocytes may T cells provide a mechanism by which specific for T10 and/or T22 to regulate immune cells. If T10 and T22 are biologically important T cell ligands, then the T cells specific for these molecules should be detectable in unimmunized mice. Tetrameric peptide-MHC reagents have been used to track both MHC class I and class II restricted T cell populations (11, 13). We therefore used the T22 protein to produce a tetrameric flow cytometry staining reagent (14). This reagent stains T cell hybridthe G8 hybridoma but not omas or the T cell LBK5 (specific for T cells in I-Ek) (9). Nearly all splenic G8 TCR transgenic mice were stained by the tetramer (Fig. 2A). Staining of T cells was not observed in either spleen or intestine (9, 15). In normal animals, approximately 0.3 to 0.6% of splenic T cells stained with the tetramer (Fig. 2C) (16). Greater than 90% of these cells are CD4 8 , while the rest are either CD4 or CD8 single positive (about 3 to 4% each) (15). A similar frequency of tetramerpositive T cells was also found in the intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte (iIEL) population (9). Tetramer binding was abolished when cells were first incubated with monomeric T22- 2M (Fig. 2D), further demonstrating the specificity of the tetramer-positive cells for T22. Further, splenic T cells from normal mice activated by plate-bound T22- 2M complex, or by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing T10, showed an induced activated phenotype on tetramerpositive, but not on the tetramer-negative cell populations (Fig. 3) (15). Taken together, these results demonstrate that a population of T cells in the spleen respond to T22 and/or T10 and that they can be identified by the T22 tetramer staining reagent. It should be noted that MICA/B, human inducible nonclassical MHC class I molecules, have been shown to trigger human T cell lines. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that MICA/B are ligands for the activating natural killer cell receptor NKG2D and that the reactivity of T cell lines to MICA/B-expressing cells is inhibited by antibodies to NKG2D. It was proposed that MICA/B might also act as ligands for the TCR, because antibodies to the receptor also inhibited the reactivity (17, 18). A direct interaction between MICA/B
