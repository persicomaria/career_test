Abstract G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein (GIT)1 is a multidomain, adaptor protein that regulates cellular processes, such as migration and protrusive activity, by bringing together various signaling molecules, including PIX, PAK, and paxillin. Mutants of GIT1, which lack the C-terminal paxillin binding domain, fail to mediate its effects on migration and protrusions, suggesting that sites within this domain are critical to GIT1 function. In this study, we show that serine 709, which is located within the paxillin binding domain, regulates GIT1 function. Phosphorylation of serine 709 is necessary for GIT1-induced effects on protrusions. Phosphorylation of this site also regulates GIT1 interaction with paxillin, which could serve to target GIT1 to the leading edge of cells. As shown by an in vitro kinase assay, PAK phosphorylates GIT1 on serine 709. Taken together, our results indicate that GIT1 phosphorylation on serine 709 increases its binding to paxillin and regulates protrusive activity in cells. Ó 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein (GIT) is a signaling, adaptor protein, which localizes to adhesions, cytoplasmic complexes, and the leading edge of cells, and regulates migration, protrusions, adhesion dynamics, and cytoskeletal organization [1­3]. GIT1 mediates its effects on adhesions and actin reorganization through its interactions with various signaling molecules including paxillin, p21-activated kinase-interacting exchange factor (PIX), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and p21-activated kinase (PAK) [1,2,4,5]. The interaction of GIT1 with paxillin through its C-terminal paxillin binding domain is necessary for its localization to adhesions and the leading edge [1]. GIT1 binds PIX through a Spa2 Homology Domain1 (SHD1) and targets actin regulators, including PIX and PAK, to adhesions and the leading edge of cells where these molecules modulate the assembly and disassembly of adhesions and protrusive activity [1,2,6].

Recent studies suggest that GIT1, like many signaling molecules, is regulated by phosphorylation. In fibroblasts, GIT1 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to cellular adhesion to fibronectin [5]. In addition, GIT1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated when cells are stimulated with epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor in a Src-dependent manner, suggesting that GIT1 is a substrate for c-Src [7­9]. However, the role that phosphorylation plays in GIT1 function and localization is not known. We recently generated a phosphorylation map of GIT1 and identified a site within its paxillin binding domain, serine 709 [10]. In the present study, we show that phosphorylation of serine 709 is necessary for the GIT1 mediated effects on protrusions. A non-phosphorylatable analog, in which serine 709 was mutated to alanine (S709A-GIT1), failed to increase protrusive activity in CHO-K1 cells. In addition, paxillin binding to S709A-GIT1 was dramatically decreased compared to wild-type GIT1 or a phosphomimetic mutant of GIT1 with a serine to aspartic acid substitution at 709 (S709D-GIT1). These results indicate that phosphorylation of serine 709 regulates GIT1 binding to

paxillin and is necessary for its effects on protrusions. Finally, the serine/threonine kinase PAK phosphorylated GIT1 on serine 709 in an in vitro kinase assay. Materials and methods
Reagents and antibodies. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM), tissue culture sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Lipofectamine transfection reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). GFP polyclonal antibody was from Molecular Probes-Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). A monoclonal antibody for paxillin was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham (Piscataway, NJ). Protein A­agarose was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Plasmids. The full-length GFP-tagged GIT1 construct was cloned as previously described [1,11]. The sequence of our full-length human GIT1

included a 9 bp insertion usually found in rat GIT1 [10,11]. S709A and S709D mutations were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by sequencing. The FLAGtagged paxillin construct was previously described [12]. Constitutively active (CA) and kinase dead (KD) myc-tagged PAK1 constructs were kindly provided by Jonathan Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). Cell culture and transfection. CHO-K1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, non-essential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin. For microscopy experiments, CHO-K1 cells were grown to 60­70% confluency in 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning) and transfected using Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 with 1 lg DNA and 5 ll of transfection reagent per well. Cells were incubated for 24­48 h and plated onto 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes, which had been coated overnight with 2 lg/ml fibronectin as previously described [13]. Kymography and quantification of net area change. For cell protrusiveness analysis, kymography assays were performed as previously described [14,15] with our modifications. In short, phase-contrast timelapse images were obtained on a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope

Fig. 1. S709A mutation inhibits the effects of GIT1 on cell protrusiveness. (A) CHO-K1 cells expressing wild-type GFP-GIT1, GFP-S709A-GIT1, or GFP-S709D-GIT1 were plated on 2 lg/ml fibronectin. The cells were imaged using time-lapse phase microscopy and protrusiveness was assessed by kymography. Kymographs for wild-type GIT1, S709A-GIT1, and S709D-GIT1 are shown. The kymographs show protrusive activity along a 1 pixel thick line (l) drawn along a forming protrusion perpendicular to the leading edge of the cells. As shown in the kymographs, the larger the angle (a), the more active the protrusion. (B) The protrusive index, which equals tana, was calculated from the kymographs for wild-type GIT1 and the two GIT1 mutants. In CHO-K1 cells expressing S709A-GIT1, the protrusive index was 10-fold lower compared with cells expressing either wild-type GIT1 or S709D-GIT1. A minimum of 10 cells per treatment and at least three protrusions per cell, from three independent experiments were analyzed. (C) Total area change was calculated by manually outlining the cells and comparing cell areas in the beginning and at the end of a 10 min interval. At least 10 cells from three separate experiments were analyzed. For both kymography and total cell area change, P values for WT/S709A and S709A/S709D pairs were less than 0.001.

using a cool CCD camera (Hamamatsu) with a 40· objective. Images were recorded at 10 s intervals for 20 min. The first frame was taken in fluorescence to confirm expression. Movies were obtained using ISee software (Inovision) or MetaMorph (Molecular Devices), then kymographs were produced and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). Kymographs were generated along 1 pixel wide line regions oriented along the direction of a protrusion and perpendicular to the edge of a lamellipodia. After kymographs were generated, straight lines were drawn from the beginning to the end of individual protrusion events and retraction events were ignored. The slopes of these lines were used to calculate protrusiveness indices. A minimum of 10 cells per treatment and at least three protrusions per cell, from three independent experiments, were analyzed. In addition to kymography, protrusiveness was analyzed by measuring the positive change in total cell area as previously described [1]. Briefly, cells were outlined at two time points separated by 10 min. The images were then thresholded and subtracted to determine the new area. In vitro PAK1 kinase assay. The phosphorylation of S709 was determined by an in vitro PAK1 kinase assay as previously described [16] with our modifications. The following peptides were used as substrates: ALEPVRSSLRLLNASA (S709 is indicated in bold) and ALEPVRASLRLLNASA, in which S709 was substituted by alanine. Constitutively active (CA) or kinase dead (KD) myc-tagged PAK1 was expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Cells were lysed in 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), and 0.5% NP-40 with proteinase inhibitors (aprotinin and E64) for 20 min on ice. CA and KD PAK1 were precipitated from cell lysates, which contained equal amounts of total protein, by incubation with 6 lg of antimyc monoclonal antibody 9E10 for 1 h followed by incubation with 60 ll of protein­A agarose for 1 h. An aliquot of beads was taken for Western blot analysis. The beads were subsequently washed three times with lysis buffer, and once with kinase buffer: 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.3), 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. Beads were then resuspended in kinase buffer to a 75% slurry and 10 ll of beads was used per one kinase reaction. Wild-type and S709A peptides at a final concentration of 500 lM were incubated with CA or KD PAK1 in kinase buffer containing 10 mM MnCl2, 250 lM ATP, and 10 lCi [c-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. Incubations were then spotted on P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman). P-81 papers were washed four times with 75 mM phosphoric acid and once with acetone, air-dried, and counted.

S709D-GIT1 are shown in Fig. 1A. Cells expressing wildtype GFP-GIT1 or GFP-S709D-GIT1 were highly protrusive, which resulted in similar protrusiveness indices on kymograms (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cells expressing GFPS709A-GIT1 showed a much lower level of protrusive activity, and their protrusiveness index was over 10-fold lower than the indices seen for cells expressing wild-type GFP-GIT1 or GFP-S709D-GIT1. When protrusiveness was assessed by another assay, similar results were obtained. A dramatic decrease in the change in total cell area was observed in cells expressing GFP-S709A-GIT1 compared to those expressing either wild-type GFP-GIT1 or GFP-S709D-GIT1. These results suggest that phosphorylation of serine 709 is necessary for the GIT1 mediated increase in protrusive activity. The native GFP that was used in these experiments has a weak tendency to dimerize at high concentrations, which is

Results and discussion S709 phosphorylation is required for the GIT1 dependent increase in protrusiveness We previously showed that GIT1 localizes to the leading edge of cells where it regulates protrusive activity by a mechanism that is dependent upon its C-terminus [1]. We further showed that a mutant of GIT1 lacking the paxillin binding domain, which is located within the C-terminus of GIT1, failed to localize to the leading edge and regulate protrusion formation. In recent studies, we identified a phosphorylation site within the paxillin binding domain of GIT1, serine 709, and hypothesized that this site mediates the GIT1-induced effects on protrusive activity in cells. To test this, we generated a phosphomimetic, in which serine 709 in GIT1 was mutated to aspartic acid (S709DGIT1), and a non-phosphorylatable analog with a serine to alanine substitution at 709 (S709A-GIT1) and transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells with GFP-tagged constructs of these two mutants and wild-type GIT1. Time-lapse phase videos of cells expressing the constructs were obtained and protrusiveness was assessed by kymography. Kymographs for wild-type GIT1, S709A-GIT1, and

Fig. 2. Phosphorylation of serine 709 regulates the GIT1-paxillin interaction. (A) HEK cells were co-transfected with FLAG-paxillin and either wild-type GFP-GIT1, GFP-S709A-GIT1, or GFP-S709D-GIT1. Equal amounts of total protein lysates were incubated with anti-GFP antibody and immunoprecipitates were blotted for paxillin or GFP. The amount of paxillin bound to GFP-S709A-GIT1 was significantly lower than that bound to wild-type GFP-GIT1. Paxillin binding to GFP-S709D GIT1 was increased slightly compared to wild-type GIT1. As a loading control, whole cell lysates were blotted for both GFP and paxillin. (B) The amount of paxillin bound to wild-type GIT1 and the two mutants was quantified over three independent experiments. Paxillin binding to each of the mutants is shown relative to that obtained with wild-type GIT1.

typically not problematic under most experimental conditions [17,18]. However, to eliminate this possibility, we generated monomeric GFP (mGFP) by mutating critical amino acids within the dimerization interface as previously described [18,19] and tagged wild-type GIT1 and the two mutants with the mGFP. When wild-type mGFP-GIT1, mGFP-S709A-GIT1, and mGFP-S709D-GIT1 were expressed in CHO-K1 cells, the effects on protrusiveness as analyzed by kymography were similar to those observed with the native GFP-tagged constructs. Cells expressing mGFP-S709A-GIT1 showed a significant decrease in protrusive activity compared to cells expressing either wildtype mGFP-GIT1 or mGFP-S709D-GIT1 (data not shown). Phosphorylation of serine 709 regulates the association of GIT1 with paxillin The location of S709 in the paxillin binding region of GIT1 and the apparent role of this residue in regulating the effects of GIT1 on protrusive activity suggested that phosphorylation of this site might affect the interaction of GIT1 with paxillin. We addressed this by examining the association of wild-type GIT1 and the two mutants with paxillin. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type GFP-GIT1, GFP-S709A-GIT1, or GFPS709D-GIT1 and GIT1 and the mutants were then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and blotted for endogenous paxillin. As shown in Fig. 2A, the amount of paxillin bound to GFP-S709A-GIT1 was significantly lower than that bound to wild-type GFP-GIT1. Paxillin binding to GFP-S709D GIT1 was increased slightly compared to wild-type GIT1. When relative paxillin binding was quan-

tified by three independent Western blots, a 4-fold decrease in binding to GFP-S709A was observed compared to wildtype GIT1 (Fig. 2B). A slight increase (1.2-fold) in paxillin binding to S709D was seen in multiple blots when compared to wild-type GIT1. These results show that phosphorylation of serine 709 regulates the interaction of GIT1 with paxillin. S709 is an in vitro substrate for PAK1 We next addressed the potential kinases that phosphorylate serine 709. Examination of the sequence surrounding this residue indicated that this site was a predicted target for PAK. To determine whether S709 is an in vitro substrate for PAK1, we incubated a synthetic peptide corresponding to GIT1 residues 703­718: ALEPVRSSLRL LNASA and a S709A substituted peptide (ALEPVRAS LRLLNASA) (Fig. 3A) with precipitated CA-PAK1 or KD-PAK1. As shown in Fig. 3B, wild-type peptide was phosphorylated by CA-PAK1 in the in vitro kinase assay. The kinase activity of PAK was necessary since phosphorylation of the wild-type peptide was completely abolished when it was incubated with precipitated KD-PAK. The two PAK mutants were incubated with a S709A substituted peptide to show that the phosphorylation was occurring on serine 709. When CA-PAK was incubated with S709A peptide, phosphorylation was decreased almost 3-fold as compared with wild-type peptide, suggesting that S709 is indeed a major in vitro target for PAK1. In summary, we identify serine 709 as a critical site in regulating GIT1 function. Phosphorylation of this site regulates the interaction of GIT1 with paxillin and is necessary for the GIT dependent increase in protrusive activity. As

Fig. 3. S709 is an in vitro phosphorylation substrate for PAK1. (A) The two synthetic peptides used in the kinase assay are shown. The wild-type peptide corresponds to residues 703­718 from the GIT1 sequence and serine 709 is indicated in bold. A second peptide, in which serine 709 was mutated to alanine (the alanine substitution is indicated in bold), was also used in the kinase assay. (B) Constitutively active (CA) or kinase dead (KD) PAK1 were expressed in CHO-K1 cells, immunoprecipitated, and incubated with the synthetic peptides. Wild-type peptide was phosphorylated by CA-PAK1 in the in vitro kinase assay. When CA-PAK was incubated with S709A peptide, phosphorylation was significantly decreased compared to wild-type peptide, suggesting that S709 is a major in vitro target for PAK1. The kinase activity of PAK was necessary since phosphorylation of the peptides was completely abolished when they were incubated with precipitated KD-PAK. The graph represents average ± SEM from three separate experiments.
