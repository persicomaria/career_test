SUMMARY

Abasic sites are among the most abundant DNA lesions formed in human cells, and they present a strong block to replication. DNA polymerase i (Poli) is one of the few DNA Pols that does not follow the A-rule opposite an abasic site. We present here three structures of human Poli in complex with DNAs containing an abasic lesion and dGTP, dTTP, or dATP as the incoming nucleotide. The structures reveal a mechanism of translesion synthesis across an abasic lesion that differs from that in other Pols. Both the abasic lesion and the incoming dNTPs are intrahelical and are closely apposed across a constricted active site cleft. The dNTPs partake in distinct networks of hydrogen bonds in the ``void'' opposite the lesion. These different patterns of hydrogen bonds, as well as stacking interactions, may underlie Poli's small preference for insertion of dGTP over other nucleotides opposite this common lesion.
INTRODUCTION Abasic sites are among the most abundant DNA lesions in humans, with up to 10,000 purine bases lost per day in each cell due to cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond (Lindahl, 1982; Lindahl and Nyberg, 1972). Hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond occurs at a high rate spontaneously, and oxidative stress and exposure to ionizing radiation and alkylating agents further increase the incidence of base loss. Although abasic lesions can be removed by the base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair pathways (Seeberg et al., 1995; Wallace, 1997), lesions that escape repair pose a problem for cellular processes such as transcription and replication that depend on an instructional template. Indeed, it has been estimated that each human liver cell contains $50,000 apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites under normal conditions (Nakamura and Swenberg, 1999). Abasic lesions block replication, and are also highly mutagenic, because when replicative DNA polymerases (Pols) do manage (inefficiently) to insert a nucleotide opposite the lesion they prefer to insert an A, in a phenomenon known as the A-rule (Avkin et al., 2002; Boiteux and Laval, 1982; Lawrence et al., 1990; Loeb and Preston,

1986; Mozzherin et al., 1997; Pages et al., 2008; Sagher and Strauss, 1983; Shibutani et al., 1997; Strauss, 2002). The mechanistic basis for the A-rule remains under debate, despite the numerous biochemical and structural studies (Avkin et al., 2002; Boiteux and Laval, 1982; Chen et al., 2008; Cuniasse et al., 1987, 1990; Fiala et al., 2007; Gelfand et al., 1998; Hogg et al., 2004; Ling et al., 2004; Loeb and Preston, 1986; Matray and Kool, 1999; Mozzherin et al., 1997; Randall et al., 1987; Reineks and Berdis, 2004; Sagher and Strauss, 1983; Shibutani et al., 1997; Strauss, 2002; Zahn et al., 2007). Human polymerase i (Poli) is one of the few DNA Pols that does not obey the A-rule for inserting nucleotides opposite the abasic site. Poli is a member of the Y-family DNA Pols that possess the ability to replicate through DNA lesions (Prakash et al., 2005). In addition to Poli, humans have three other Y-family Pols--Polh, Polk, and Rev1--each with a unique DNA damage bypass and fidelity profile (Prakash et al., 2005). Poli is an unusual polymerase in that it inserts nucleotides opposite template purines with a much higher efficiency and fidelity than opposite template pyrimidines. And, even for the template purines, Poli exhibits a higher efficiency and fidelity opposite template A than opposite template G. Poli is highly inefficient at incorporating the correct nucleotide opposite template C and T, and, opposite template T, it misincorporates a G approximately ten times better than it incorporates the correct nucleotide A (Haracska et al., 2001; Johnson et al., 2000; Tissier et al., 2000; Washington et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2000). The ternary crystal structure of Poli bound to template A and an incoming dTTP shows that the templating A adopts a syn conformation and forms a Hoogsteen base pair with the incoming T, which remains in the anti conformation (Nair et al., 2004, 2006b). Similarly, in the structure of Poli paired with a template G and an incoming dCTP, a G.C+ Hoogsteen base pair is formed in the polymerase active site (Nair et al., 2005a, 2006b). Hoogsteen base pairing provides an elegant basis for the much higher efficiency and fidelity of nucleotide incorporation opposite template purines than opposite pyrimidines, because only the templates A and G have a Hoogsteen edge by which they can establish two hydrogen bonds with the correct incoming pyrimidine nucleotide. Because of the lack of a Hoogsteen edge, there are few hydrogen-bonding possibilities opposite template pyrimidines. The ability to form Hoogsteen base pairs allows Poli to promote replication through adducts such as 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine that disrupt the Watson-Crick (W-C) edge

tions, underlie Poli's preference for insertion of dGTP over dTTP/dATP opposite the abasic lesion. RESULTS Structure Determination We crystallized Poli with a ``doubleended'' 18 nt template primer designed to present an abasic lesion in the active sites of two symmetrically bound Poli molecules (see Experimental Procedures). We have used a similar strategy previously to crystallize Poli with undamaged and damaged DNAs (Nair et al., 2004, 2005a, 2006a, 2006b). Cocrystals with incoming dGTP, dATP, and dTTP were obtained under identical conditions (from PEG solutions) belonging to space group P6522 with cell dimensions of a = ° ° ° 98 A, b = 98 A, c = 203 A and a = b = 90 , g = 120 . We were unable to obtain suitable crystals of Poli with an incoming dCTP. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the PoliA.dTTP (with dA at the templating position and dTTP as the incoming nucleotide) complex as a search model (Nair et al., 2006b). The PoliAbasic.dGTP, PoliAbasic.dTTP, and PoliAbasic.dATP complexes ° were refined to resolutions of 2.1, 2.1, and 2.2 A, respectively. The refined models contain Poli residues 25­370, 379­394, and 404­414 (the first 24 and the last 6 residues are disordered, and residues 371­378 and 395­403 comprising two loops in the PAD [polymerase associated domain] have poor density), DNA nucleotides 4­11 (three of the four unpaired template nucleotides at the 50 end are disordered), an incoming dNTP, two Mg2+ ions, and water molecules (Figure 1). The PoliAbasic.dGTP (Rfree of 25.8%; Rcryst of 22.0%), PoliAbasic.dTTP (Rfree of 24.7%; Rcryst of 22.0%), and PoliAbasic.dATP (Rfree of 25.5%; Rcryst of 21.6%) complexes contain 224, 213, and 181 water molecules, respectively. All three structures have good stereochemistry, with $86% of the residues in the most favored regions of

but not the Hoogsteen edge of the templating purine (Nair et al., 2006a). Curiously, Poli can also incorporate nucleotides opposite an abasic lesion, albeit with reduced efficiency. Although Poli can incorporate any of the four nucleotides opposite the abasic site, it exhibits a small preference for the insertion of G followed by T, A, and then a C (Johnson et al., 2000). To gain insights into the mechanism(s) by which Poli inserts nucleotides opposite abasic lesions, we have determined structures of Poli in complex with DNAs containing an abasic lesion at the templating position and with dGTP, dTTP, or dATP as the incoming nucleotide. Together, the structures show that the Poli active site facilitates the entry of dNTPs despite the lack of an instructional templating base. Poli is able to stabilize the incoming nucleotide opposite the abasic lesion without any significant change in conformation of either the protein, the DNA, or the nucleotide. Both the abasic lesion and the incoming dNTPs are intrahelical, and the dNTPs partake in distinct networks of hydrogen bonds in the ``void'' opposite the lesion. We suggest that these different patterns of hydrogen bonds, as well as stacking interac-

the Ramachandran plot and <1% in the disallowed regions (Table 1). Overall Arrangement In all three ternary complexes, a Poli molecule binds to each end of the double-ended ``abasic'' template primer. The two molecules are related by a crystallographic two-fold axis and thus make identical contacts with the template primer. Poli has the familiar right-handed architecture with palm (residues 25­37, 99­224), fingers (38­98), and thumb (225­288) domains, and the PAD (residues 298­414) unique to Y-family polymerases (Figure 1). The four domains occupy identical positions with respect to the template primer in all three complexes (Figure 1). The palm forms the floor of the DNA binding cavity and carries the active site residues (Asp34, Asp126, and Glu127) that catalyze the nucleotidyl transfer reaction, while the fingers domain lies over the abasic lesion and the incoming nucleotide. The thumb and the PAD are connected by a long linker that spans the width of the DNA. The thumb skims the minor-groove surface on one side of the template primer, while the PAD docks in the major groove on the other side. The interface between the two

° Poli molecules is relatively small, with $700 A2 of surface area buried between the thumb domain of one polymerase and the PAD of the other. The majority of Poli-DNA interactions are mediated by the PAD, wherein the main-chain amides on ``outer'' b strands of the PAD b sheet make a series of hydrogen bonds with the template and primer strands. The PoliAbasic.dGTP Ternary Complex The abasic lesion does not loop or bulge out of the DNA helix (Figures 1­3). This is in contrast to an archeael homolog of human Polk, namely Dpo4, structures of which have been reported in complex with abasic lesions (Ling et al., 2004). In Dpo4, the abasic site loops out of the DNA helix and the incoming dNTP pairs with a base 50 to the lesion (Figure 4). By contrast, in Poli, the abasic sugar is accommodated intrahelically in a small hydrophobic pocket formed by the aliphatic portions of Lys60 and Gln59 side chains, the aromatic ring of Tyr61, and the nonpolar side chain of Leu62 (Figures 2 and 4). The lesion is further locked in place by a salt link between Lys60 and a phosphate on the 30 side of the lesion and a hydrogen bond between Ser307 (on the PAD) and the phosphate of the lesion (Figure 2). Incoming dGTP sits

opposite the abasic lesion, and not opposite the 50 base as in Dpo4. The dGTP sugar stacks over the aromatic ring of Tyr39, and a hydrogen bond is formed between its 30 -OH and the main-chain amide of Tyr39. The dGTP triphosphate moiety interleaves between the palm and fingers domains, and makes hydrogen bonds with Thr65, Tyr68, Arg71, and Lys77 from the fingers domain and Lys214 from the palm domain (Figure 2A). The triphosphate moiety and the catalytic residues Asp34, Asp126, and Glu127 coordinate two Mg2+ ions in the active

site. Based on this geometry, Poli is well poised for catalysis with the putative 30 oxygen (at the primer terminus) located ° $3.2 A from the dGTP a-phosphate and aligned more or less linearly with respect to the scissile Pa-O30 bond (Figure 2A). In all, these interactions with the dGTP sugar and triphosphate moiety are similar to those observed in previous Poli structures, and they serve to position dGTP in the active site (Nair et al., 2004, 2005a, 2006b). The dGTP base extends toward the abasic lesion. Strikingly, the distance between the C20 atom on the lesion ° sugar and the N2 amino group of the dGTP base is only $3.4 A.

adjacent base pair (guanine [template]:cytosine [primer]) at the ° primer terminus is $3.4 A, characteristic of B-DNA, with $304 ° A2 of surface area buried at this interface. The intrahelical position of the base is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds in the minor groove (Figure 3A). That is, the N2 amino group of dGTP makes ° a direct hydrogen bond with OE1 of Gln59 (2.8 A) on the fingers domain, and a single water molecule mediates hydrogen bonds ° ° between N2 (3.5 A) of dGTP, and OH of Tyr39 (2.7 A) and NE2 ° ) of Poli (Figure 3A). of Gln59 (3.1 A To evaluate the contribution that hydrogen bonding by the N2 amino group of dGTP makes to its incorporation opposite the abasic lesion, we compared the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of dGTP versus dITP (20 -deoxyinosine-triphosphate) incorporation using steady-state kinetic analyses (Johnson et al., 2000; Nair et al., 2006a). Because dITP lacks the N2 amino group, any reduction in the efficiency of dITP incorporation would reflect the contribution that hydrogen bonding by the N2 amino group makes to dGTP incorporation opposite the abasic lesion. Because we observe an $15-fold reduction in the efficiency of dITP incorporation opposite the abasic lesion (Table 2), we infer that hydrogen bonding of the N2 amino group with the Gln59 and Tyr39 residues makes a positive contribution to dGTP incorporation opposite the abasic lesion. The PoliAbasic.dTTP Ternary Complex In the PoliAbasic.dTTP complex, Poli adopts a nearly identical conformation to that observed in the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex (Figure 1). The polymerases superimpose with a root-mean° square deviation (rmsd) of only 0.2 A (for 728 Ca atoms). The DNA configuration is also very similar, with an average rise of ° 3.2 A and a helical twist of 30.9 /30.7 in the two complexes. Interactions with the dTTP triphosphate moiety are similar to those observed in the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex (Figure 2), and ° the C10 -C10 distance across the Abasic:dTTP pair is 9.1 A, as ° in the Abasic:dGTP pair. However, because compared to 9.0 A

of its smaller size, the dTTP base does not fill the space opposite the lesion to the same extent as dGTP. For example, the distance ° between the lesion sugar C20 and the dTTP O2 atoms is 6.5 A, ° as compared to 3.4 A between the C20 and N2 atoms in the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex. Accordingly, there are fewer stacking interactions with the adjacent base pair at the primer terminus, with the dTTP thymine stacking primarily over the cytosine on the primer strand (Figure 2B). The amount of surface area buried ° ° at this interface is $264 A2, as compared to $304 A2 in the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex. Also, unlike the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex, there is no direct hydrogen bond between the dTTP base and the polymerase (Figure 3B). Most of the interactions in the minor groove derive from two water molecules, one of which occupies a position nearly identical to that in the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex and mediates hydrogen bonds between O2 of the dTTP base ° ° ° (2.9 A), OH of Tyr39 (2.8 A), and NE2 of Gln59 (3.2 A). The second ° from the first, coincides with the water molecule is located $4 A N2 amino group of dGTP in the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex, and ° ° mediates hydrogen bonds between N3 (2.8 A) and O2 (3.1 A) ° of dTTP with OE1 of Gln59 (3.2 A) (Figure 3B). Compared to the undamaged PoliA.dTTP complex, the configuration of Poli remains invariant, superimposing with an rmsd of ° 0.4 A (728 Ca atoms) (see Figure S1 available online). The conformations of DNAs (the duplex portions) and incoming dTTPs are ° also essentially the same, superimposing with rmsd's of 0.15 A ° (28 P atoms) and 0.2 A (all atoms), respectively. The most significant difference between the undamaged PoliA.dTTP and damaged PoliAbasic.dTTP complexes is a shift in the abasic sugar ° toward the PAD (away from the incoming nucleotide) by $1 A, which eases the entry of the two water molecules that mediate a network of hydrogen bonds in the minor groove (Figure 3B). The PoliAbasic.dATP Ternary Complex The structure is close to that described above for the PoliAbasic.dGTP ternary complex (Figure 1). For example, the C10 -C10 distance ° across the Abasic:dATP pair is 8.5 A, and the distance between ° the lesion C20 and dATP C2 atoms is only 4.5 A. In the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex, the N2 amino group of the dGTP base overlaps with the guanine 30 to the lesion (on the template strand). Because the dATP base lacks an N2 amino group, it stacks primarily over the primer cytosine (Figure 2C). As such, the amount of surface area buried ° at this interface is less than in the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex: 274 A2 ° as compared to $304 A2. Also, there are fewer interactions in the

minor groove (Figure 3C). For example, there is no direct or watermediated hydrogen bond between the dATP base and the polymerase. Rather, a single water molecule, at the same position as in the PoliAbasic.dGTP complex, makes hydrogen bonds with OH of ° ° Tyr39 (2.8 A) and NE2 of Gln59 (3.2 A) (Figure 3C). DISCUSSION The noninstructional nature of abasic lesions makes them potentially cytotoxic and highly mutagenic. Almost all high-fidelity DNA Pols prefer to incorporate an A opposite the lesion, but the mechanistic basis for this preference remains uncertain, with suggestions ranging from better stacking capabilities of dATP to better shape complementarities opposite the lesion (Chen et al., 2008; Matray and Kool, 1999; Reineks and Berdis, 2004; Zahn et al., 2007). Poli, a member of the Y family, is one of the few DNA Pols that does not obey the A-rule. Poli can insert all four nucleotides opposite an abasic lesion, but with a small preference for a G (Johnson et al., 2000). We present here ternary complex structures of human Poli with three of the four possible nucleotides opposite an abasic lesion (Figure 1; Figure S2). From the structures, the ability of Poli to insert all four nucleotides derives from the same structural feature that makes it conducive to Hoogsteen base pairing, namely a constricted active site that reduces the C10 -C10 ° distance across the sugars from $10.5 A in most DNA polymer° in Poli (Nair et al., 2004, 2005a, 2006a, 2006b). The ases to <9 A abasic lesion sugar is entrenched in a cavity lined by residues from the fingers domain, including the side chain of Leu62 and the aliphatic portions of Gln59 and Lys60. Lys60 also makes hydrogen bonds with the phosphate 30 to the abasic lesion. Interestingly, Leu62 and Lys60 are unique to Poli, whereas Gln59 is present only in Poli and Polh. On the other side of the active site, the dNTP sugar is fixed by packing against the aromatic ring of Tyr39, as well as by a hydrogen bond between its 30 -OH and the main-chain amide of the tyrosine. Consequently, the ° C10 -C10 distance between the sugars shrinks to 8.5­9.1 A in complexes with dGTP, dTTP, and dATP. Because of this shortened C10 -C10 distance the dNTP bases almost fill the void opposite the abasic lesions, with the dGTP/dATP bases approaching ° within van der Waals distance ($3.4­4.5 A) of the lesion sugar. In all, this broad shape complementarity may underlie Poli's ability to insert all four nucleotides opposite an abasic lesion. Poli inserts nucleotides opposite an abasic lesion in the order of preference G > T > A > C. Overall, the differences in catalytic efficiencies for the incorporation of different nucleotides are relatively small, with G, T, and A incorporated $3, 2.2, and 1.5 times more efficiently than a C, respectively (Johnson et al., 2000). Despite these small differences, it is noteworthy that dGTP ° makes the most base stacking interactions, with $304 A2 of surface area buried with the adjacent base pair, as compared ° ° to $264 A2 for dTTP and 274 A2 for dATP. The dGTP base also makes a direct hydrogen bond with Poli, whereas the dATP base does not partake in direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the polymerase. In some respect, given that dGTP partakes in most base stacking interactions and makes a direct hydrogen bond with Poli, it is surprising that it is not inserted with greater catalytic efficiency. The N2 amino group of dGTP could contribute both positively and negatively to selectivity, wherein

the positive contribution would come from van der Waals contacts with the base 30 to the lesion and a direct hydrogen bond to the polymerase, whereas a negative contribution may derive from electrostatic repulsion between the partial negative charges on the N atom and the O2 (T/C) or N(G) atoms on the adjacent bases. To evaluate the contribution of the N2 amino group to dGTP incorporation opposite the abasic lesion, we compared the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of dGTP versus dITP incorporation using steady-state kinetic analyses (Table 2). We observe an $15-fold reduction in the efficiency of dITP incorporation opposite the abasic lesion, from which we infer that the N2 amino group contributes (on balance) positively to dGTP incorporation opposite the abasic lesion. In all three Poli structures the abasic lesion and the dNTPs are intrahelical. This is in stark contrast to the structure of Dpo4 with an abasic site (Ab-1), where the lesion is looped out toward the solvent in the gap between the fingers domain and the PAD, and the base 50 to the lesion swings in to pair with the incoming nucleotide (Figure 4) (Ling et al., 2004). In Poli, an abasic site is unable to loop out for two reasons. First, the abasic sugar is firmly entrenched in a hydrophobic cavity delineated by Gln59, Lys60, and Leu62 (described above), where Lys60 and Leu62 are unique to Poli. Second, an abasic lesion in an extrahelical position would sterically clash with Lys60 and Glu97 from the fingers domain and Ser307 from the PAD (Figure 2). The gap between the fingers domain and the PAD is constricted over this region and partially blocked by Lys60 and Ser307, which extend across the space to make hydrogen bonds with the sugar phosphate of the template strand (Figures 2 and 4). In Dpo4, the extrahelical position of the abasic lesion gives rise to À1 frameshift mutations during DNA synthesis (Ling et al., 2004). In contrast, DNA synthesis across an abasic lesion by Poli will lend to substitution mutations that are less deleterious than the frameshift mutations generated by Dpo4 (Ling et al., 2004). We show here that Poli inserts nucleotides opposite an abasic lesion without instruction from the template strand. The constricted active site cleft of Poli helps to stabilize an incoming nucleotide opposite the lesion without any significant change in conformation of the protein, the DNA, or the nucleotide. Whereas replicative Pols insert an A opposite an abasic lesion, Poli has a small preference for a G, derived from a combination of base stacking and specific interactions with the polymerase. Interestingly, the replicative Pol from bacteriophage T4 obeys the A-rule, but it can incorporate a nonnatural 5-nitro-1-indolyl20 -deoxyriboside-50 -triphosphate (5-NITP) nucleotide with 1000-fold greater efficiency than dATP (Reineks and Berdis, 2004). From the structure of a related Pol from bacteriophage RB69 with 5-NITP (Zahn et al., 2007), stacking interactions with the base 30 to the templating lesion appear to be the primary determinant of this preference. The most dramatic example of abasic lesion bypass is provided by Rev1, which incorporates a C opposite the lesion with much greater catalytic efficiency than A, G, or T (Haracska et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 1996). The structure of Rev1 reveals a novel protein-template-directed mechanism of DNA synthesis, wherein an arginine makes specific hydrogen bonds with the W-C edge of incoming dCTP (Nair et al., 2005b). The pattern of hydrogen bonding is such that substitution by any other incoming nucleotide would lead to loss of hydrogen bonds, and unfavorable electrostatic and

steric intrusion. Poli and Rev1 have thus evolved somewhat different strategies (and nucleotide preferences) to cope with a noninstructional template, but both polymerases participate directly in specifying incoming dGTP or dCTP, respectively.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Crystallization The GST-Poli (residues 1­420) fusion protein was expressed and purified as described previously (Johnson et al., 2000). A single self-complementary oligonucleotide (18 nt) containing the abasic site (tetrahydrofuran analog) at the fourth position from the 50 end, and with a dideoxycytosine at the 30 end (50 -TCTAPGGGTCCTAGGACCCdd-30 ), was synthesized, purified, desalted, and lyophilized. Prior to crystallization, the oligonucleotide was annealed with itself to give a ``double-ended'' template primer with two replicative ends. For crystallization, Poli and DNA were mixed in the ratio of 1:1.2, followed by the addition of incoming nucleotide (dGTP, dTTP, or dATP) and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 20 mM and 10 mM, respectively. All three ternary complexes crystallized under similar conditions, namely from solutions containing 10%­15% PEG 5000 MME and 0.2­0.4 M (NH4)2SO4 in 0.1 M MES buffer (pH 6.5). The cocrystals belong to space group P6522 with cell dimen° ° ° sions of a = 98 A, b = 98 A, c = 203 A, a = b = 90 , and g = 120 . For data collection, the cocrystals were cryoprotected by soaks for 5 min in mother liquor solutions containing 5%, 10%, and 15% glycerol, respectively, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Structure Determination and Refinement X-ray data on cryocooled cocrystals were measured at the Advanced Photon Source (beamline 17-ID) (Table 1). The data were indexed and integrated using DENZO and reduced using SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The structure was determined by molecular replacement (MR), using the earlier PoliA.dTTP complex as a search model (Nair et al., 2004, 2006b). The program AMoRe gave a unique MR solution (Navaza, 1994), which was then subjected to rigid-body refinement using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). Electron density maps showed the clear presence of incoming nucleotide as well as clear density for the abasic lesion. Following further iterative rounds of refinement with CNS, model building with the program O (Jones et al., 1991), and water picking, the Rfree lowered to around 28% for all three complexes. The presence and conformation of the abasic site were confirmed with simulated annealing omit maps (Figure 1). At this point, the refinement was continued with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997), which allows for the anisotropic motion of rigid bodies, described as TLS parameters (Winn et al., 2003). Briefly, TLS refinement was performed with the Poli palm, fingers, and thumb domains, the PAD was defined as four rigid units, and the DNA, incoming nucleotide, and an Mg2+ ion were defined together as a fifth rigid unit. TLS refinement with REFMAC (using the same test set of reflections used to calculate Rfree in CNS) dropped the Rfree and Rcryst at the end of refinement to about 25% and 22%, respectively (Table 1). The final models for all three complexes include Poli residues 25­414 (there is no density for the first 24 residues), DNA nucleotides 4­11 (electron density for three of the four unpaired template nucleotides at the 50 end was not visible), incoming nucleotide, two Mg2+ ions, and a number of water molecules (Table 1). The models have good stereochemistry, as shown by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), with about 86% of the residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and <1% in the disallowed regions.
