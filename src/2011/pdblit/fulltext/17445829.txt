Abstract As a novel therapeutic approach in complement-mediated pathologies, we recently developed a human C3 derivative capable of obliterating functional complement by a catalytic, non-inhibitory mechanism. In this derivative, the C-terminal region of hC3 was substituted by a 275 amino acid sequence derived from the corresponding sequence of cobra venom factor (CVF), a complement-activating C3b homologue from snake venom. In this study, we replaced shorter C-terminal sequences of hC3 by corresponding CVF sequences to further reduce potential immunogenicity and to identify domains essential for the formation of functionally stable C3 convertases. In one of these derivatives that is still capable of obliterating functional complement in vitro, the non-human portion could be reduced to a small domain located in the C-terminus of different complement proteins. This conserved NTR/C345C motif is known to be involved in assembly of different convertases of the complement system. These results suggest a major role of the C345C domain in the regulation of the half-life of the C3 convertase. Moreover, its overall identity of 96% to human C3 renders this derivative a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention in complement-mediated pathologies. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The complement system is a highly sophisticated hostdefense system playing an important role in both innate and antibody-mediated immunity. Pathophysiological disregulation of the complement system, however, contributes to tissue damage in many clinical conditions including ischemia-reperfusion injuries after myocardial infarction, interventional activation of complement in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, and immune-mediated diseases [1­4]. In consequence, there is an urgent need for therapeutic complement inhibitors. Approaches for inhibition of complement developed so far employ the blockade of essential cascade components using inhibitory proteins, small compound inhibitors or solubilized receptor molecules [5­7].

However, these reagents exert their activity by blocking complement components at a 1:1 stoichiometry and therefore, need to be present in relatively high concentrations. Recently, we developed an alternative strategy for catalytic inhibition of complement, by modifying the C3 convertase of the alternative complement pathway (AP) [8,9]. This pathway is continuously activated at a low rate in human plasma due to slow, spontaneous hydrolysis of plasma protein C3 to C3(H2 O) [10]. Upon binding of factor B and cleavage of C3b-bound factor B by factor D, the actual AP C3 convertase, C3bBb, is formed, which initiates amplification of the complement cascade by increased deposition of C3b and subsequent formation of new C3 convertases [11]. The natural AP C3 convertase, C3bBb, is tightly controlled by a complex network of regulatory proteins which irreversibly dissociate the convertase subunits and serve as cofactors for the proteolytic cleavage of C3b by factor I [12]. Moreover, it is controlled by a half-life limited to less than 2 min [13].

In order to extend the half-life of this convertase for therapeutic applications, we substituted structural elements of human C3 (hC3) by corresponding sequences derived from cobra venom factor (CVF). CVF, a non-toxic 149 kDa C3b homologue from snake venom [14­17], forms a CVF-dependent C3 convertase which escapes regulation by regulatory proteins, is active in fluid phase and exhibits an increased half-life of 7 h [15]. The CVFBb convertase obliterates functional complement in vivo for days by continuous consumption of complement components [15]. CVF has been shown to be highly effective in many experimental models of complement-mediated pathologies and has provided the proof-of-concept for the beneficial effect of catalytic complement depletion (reviewed in [18]). For therapeutic applications, however, CVF is not suitable due to its immunogenic properties. In our strategy of adopting the mechanism of CVF for a human C3 molecule we have replaced in a previous study the C-terminal region of hC3 by a 275 amino acid sequence derived from the corresponding C-terminal region of CVF [9]. This derivative provides an identity of 91% to human C3 and is capable of forming a stable convertase with a half-life comparable to that of the CVF-dependent C3 convertase. Furthermore, hC3-DIII exhibits significantly reduced C5 convertase activity as compared to CVF, thereby reducing harmful deposition of the anaphylatoxin C5a. In this study, we aimed for refinement of the substitutions in the hC3 molecule required for establishment of stable C3 convertases to further reduce potential immunogenicity and remaining C5 convertase activity. Our study demonstrates that a hC3 derivative containing less than 4% of foreign CVFderived protein sequences still is capable of forming a stable C3 convertase with minimal C5 convertase activity. These results emphasize the feasibility of developing novel therapeutics for catalytic reduction of complement activity in complement-mediated pathologies.

described [8,9]. For generation of the hC3 derivative DIV-VI, the cDNA of human C3 in pcDNA3 as well as the cDNA of CVF were used [8]. For the cloning of DIV the fragment of the 3 -terminus of the coding sequence of CVF was amplified from CVF cDNA by PCR using the oligonucleotides S50 (TATGTGTACAAAACCAAGCTGCTTCG), AS51 (TTCTTCTAGATTAAGTAGGGCAGCCAAACTCAGT). The obtained DNA was inserted into the expression vector of hC3 in pcDNA3 [8] via the restriction sites of Bsp1407I and XbaI. Insertion of a N-terminal 6x-his-tag affinitypeptide and an enterokinase cleavage site was performed by generation and joining of fragments by PCR using oligonucleotides S01 (CTGCTGACTAGTGCGGCCGCTATAAATATGGGACCCACCTCAGGTCC), AS61 (ATGATGATGATGATGATGCCCCAGAGCCAGGGGGAGG), S62 (CATCATCATCATCAT-CATGACGATGACGATAAAAGTCCCAT) and AS03 (AGTACCTTCCGGCTCAGCACAACCTCC). The resulting fragment finally was inserted into the cDNA of hC3 derivative DIV via restriction sites for NotI and Bpu1102I. For generation of DV two fragments were generated using the oligonucleotides S55 (TATGTGTACAAGACCCGACTGGTC), AS56 (GGAATTTTTATCCTTCTCTCCCCAGAAATCGGA) and the cDNA of hC3, as well as the oligonucleotides S57 (TGGGGAGAGAAGGATAAAAATTCCTACATCATT), AS51 (see above) and the cDNA of CVF. After joining these fragments the obtained DNA was inserted into the expression vector of hC3 via the restriction sites of Bsp1407I and XbaI. For generation of hC3 derivative DVI the fragment providing a stop codon at position 1548 of hC3 was amplified from CVF cDNA by PCR using the oligonucleotides S58 (TATGTGTACAAGACCTGACTGCTTCGAATAGAAGAACAA), AS51 (see above). The obtained fragment was inserted into the expression vector of hC3 via the restriction sites of Bsp1407I and XbaI. Insertion of a N-terminal strep-tag II affinity-peptide and an enterokinase cleavage site into the hC3 derivatives was performed as described [8]. 2.3. Transfection of CHO cells Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) cultivated according to standard protocols [19] were transfected with DNA of the expression vectors using Geneporter (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). 2.4. Purification of the hC3 derivatives from supernatant of stably transfected CHO cells The his-tagged hC3 derivative DIV was purified using Nichelat affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The st-tagged hC3 derivative DIII was purified as described [9]. Protein concentrations and purity of the fractions were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against PBS and employed for further characterization.

2.5. Complement consumption assay The complement-consuming activity was determined according to established protocols [20] with slight modifications. Briefly, 20 l of protein sample or GVBS++ (2.5 mM Na-5,5-diethyl-barbituric acid, 143 mM NaCl, 0.75 mM MgCl2 , 0.15 mM CaCl2 , 0.1% Gelatine, pH 7.4; serum control) was mixed with 20 l normal human serum (diluted 1:2 in GVBS++ ) and incubated for 3 h at 37  C. After addition of 100 l of GVBS++ and 30 l of sensitized sheep erythrocytes (5 × 108 cells/ml) generated by incubation with anti-sheep erythrocyte antibodies, the incubation was continued at 37  C. Every 10 min of incubation, control samples containing no serum (GVBS++ control) or only serum (serum control) were supplemented with 850 l icecold GVBS++ , centrifuged and analyzed for the release of hemoglobin. When serum control values reached approximately 80% of maximal lysis, all samples were processed as described above. GVBS++ control containing only erythrocytes was performed parallel. The percentage of lysis was determined according to formula (sample - GVBS++ control)/(serum control - GVBS++ control) × 100. 2.6. Solid phase complement consumption assay of strep-tag II-derivatized proteins Streptactin (3 g in 40 l 0.1 M NaHCO3 , pH 9.5) was immobilized onto polystyrene supports overnight at 4  C. Thereafter, the wells were rinsed 3 times with 200 l PBStween 20 (0.1%, v/v) and blocked with PBS-BSA (3%, w/v). After washing 3 times with PBS-tween 20 (0.1%, v/v), different volumes of the supernatants of transient expressions were applied to the wells. After incubation overnight at 4  C under agitation, the wells were rinsed 3 times with PBS-tween 20 (0.1%, v/v). Subsequently, 60 l GVBS++ containing normal human serum for 80% lysis of sensitized erythrocytes were added and the ELISA plate was incubated for 3 h at 37  C under vigorous shaking at 150 rpm (InnovaTM , New Brunswick Scientific, N¨ rtingen, Geru many). Subsequently, the supernatants were transferred into 2 ml reaction tubes, mixed with 100 l of GVBS++ and 30 l of sensitized erythrocytes, and assayed for complement consumption. 2.7. Bystander lysis assay The Bystander lysis assay for analysis of fluid phase C5 convertase activity was carried out according to established protocols [19] with slight modifications as described [9]. Briefly, the sample (20 l) was mixed with 20 l GVBS++ , 20 l guinea pig serum and 20 l of guinea pig erythrocytes (5 × 108 cells/ml) and incubated for 3 h at 37  C. Samples containing no protein (serum control) or no serum (water control) were used as controls. After addition of 1 ml ice-cold GVBS++ or water, respectively, the samples were analyzed as described above. The percentage of lysis was determined

according to formula (sample - serum control)/(water control - serum control) × 100. 2.8. Other methods SDS-PAGE, western blotting as well as standard procedures in molecular biology were performed according to established protocols [21].

3. Results 3.1. Generation and transient expression of hC3 derivatives Utilizing the framework of hC3 and C-terminal structural elements of CVF, we generated several hC3 derivatives. The previously reported biologically active hC3 derivative (hC3-DIII) in which the C-terminal 275 amino acid residues had been replaced by a corresponding CVF-derived sequence [9], provided the basis for the design. In order to identify those amino acid residues in the C-terminus of hC3 which need to be replaced by corresponding CVF-derived residues for the generation of biologically active hC3 derivatives, we first compared the primary structure of both the hC3and the CVF-derived 275 amino acids. The sequence alignment shown in Fig. 1, revealed more homology in the N-terminal than in the C-terminal regions of the 275 amino acid fragments. This observation suggest a more relevant contribution of the C-terminal sequences of the 275 amino acid fragments to the different biological properties of hC3 and CVF. To test this hypothesis, we generated three additional hC3 derivatives. As shown in Fig. 2, in construct DIV we substituted only the 116 C-terminal amino acids of the 275 amino acid fragment. This 116 amino acid fragment exhibits only 44% identity. In the second construct DV, substitution was limited to the C-terminal 48 amino acids. As control, the terminal 116 amino acids of the hC3 were eliminated in construct DVI. The constructs DIV and DV display an overall sequence identity to human C3 of 96% and 98%, respectively. For analyses of the complement-consuming activity in a solid phase assay all hC3 derivatives were derivatized with the affinity octapeptide strep-tag II (St) [22] at the C-terminus of the leader sequence. After cloning of the expression plasmids and subsequent transfection of CHO cells, the derivatives were detectable in the culture supernatants by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 3A). The expression levels of these constructs were found to be in the range of 1­2 g/ml. In SDS-PAGE and western blotting analyses under non-reducing conditions, rCVF, hC3, and the hC3 derivatives exhibited an identical apparent molecular weight in the range of 200 kDa, similar to that of native hC3. According to the deletion of the Cterminal 116 amino acids the hC3 derivate DVI exhibited a slightly reduced molecular weight.

Fig. 1. Sequence alignment of the C-terminal domains of human C3 and CVF. Comparison of the 275 C-terminal amino acids of hC3 and CVF. Alignment was performed using clustalW. Disulfide bonds are shown as lines connecting cystein residues (in squares). The residues substituted in hC3-DIV or eliminated in DVI are bold, the sequences substituted in hC3-DV is underlined. Identity is indicated by asterisk, conservative or semi-conservative substitutions by two or one dots. The putative C345C domains of hC3 and CVF are shaded gray.

The proteins in supernatants of transiently transfected cells were assayed for complement consumption activity by a solid phase assay employing streptactin-coated supports [8]. Based on the intensity of the western blot bands, the concentrations of the recombinant protein were adjusted to comparable values. Immobilization of strep-tag IIderivatized proteins to the support utilized for the solid phase assay was verified by ELISA-techniques (Fig. 3B). Derivative hC3-DIII and rCVF were used as control. The derivative hC3-DVI exhibited slight complement consuming activity, whereas derivatives DV and DVI did not effect any detectable consumption of complement (Fig. 3C). These results could be verified by a fluid phase assay utilizing the recombinant

proteins after immunoprecipitation from supernatants of transiently transfected cells as described [8] (data not shown). 3.2. Functional analysis of purified hC3 derivative DIV To analyze the functional activity of derivative DIV more in detail, the protein was modified with a 6xhis-tag at the C-terminus of the leader sequence. After establishment of a stably transfected cell line, the recombinant protein was enriched from cellular supernatants using Ni-chelate affinity chromatography. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting under non-reducing and reducing conditions revealed an identical molecular mass as the strep tag II-derivatized pro-

Fig. 3. Transient expression of hC3, CVF and hC3 derivatives. A: Western blot analysis of the transiently expressed proteins. Native hC3 and culture supernatants of transiently transfected CHO cells containing rCVF, rhC3 and the hC3 derivatives were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) under nonreducing conditions, transferred to a PVDF-membrane, and detected with polyclonal anti-CVF antibodies (rCVF) or anti-hC3 antibodies (hC3, rhC3, derivatives) as described in Section 2. B: Immobilisation of transiently streptag II-derivatized proteins onto streptactin-coated supports was analysed by ELISA. Detection of the bound proteins was performed using anti-CVF or anti-hC3 polyclonal antibodies from goat, diluted 1:1000 in PBS-BSA (1.5%, w/v), and anti-goat HRP-conjugate, diluted 1:1000 in PBS-BSA (1.5%, w/v). Controls (open bars) were performed by omission of streptactin. C: Solid-phase complement consumption assay. Strep-tag II-derivatized proteins were immobilized to streptactin-coated supports and assayed for complement consuming activity as described in Section 2. Strep-tag IIderivatized hC3 was utilized as negative control. Data in Fig. 2 represent mean values ± S.D. obtained from at least three independent experiments.

Fig. 4. Characterization of stably expressed derivative DIV. A: Complement consumption assay. Purified hC3 (gray dots), nCVF (gray squares), hC3-DIII (black up triangles), or hC3-DIV (black down triangles) were assayed for complement-consuming activity as described in Section 2. B: Bystander lysis assay. Purified hC3 (gray dots), nCVF (gray squares), hC3-DIII (black up triangles), and hC3-DIV (black down triangles) were assayed for fluid phase C5 convertase activity utilizing bystander lysis assay as described in Section 2.

Since CVFBb also exerts C5 convertase activity in fluid phase [23], derivative hC3-DIV was analyzed for potential fluid phase C5 convertase activity in a bystander lysis assay (Fig. 4B). The capability of derivative DIV for activation of guinea pig serum in fluid phase was significantly reduced in comparison to CVF. Only 15% of the fluid phase C5 convertase activity of CVF was found to be retained in the derivative, which is slightly lower than the C5 convertase activity retained in derivative DIII.

4. Discussion teins, and a two chain structure as demonstrated for hC3 and rCVF expressed in mammalian cells (not shown) [8]. As shown in Fig. 4 the enriched derivative DIV was analyzed for complement-consuming activity over a broad concentration range. The obtained data confirmed the CVF-like activity observed in analyses of transiently expressed hC3 derivative. The hC3 derivative DIV exhibited a complementconsuming activity which is comparable to that of DIII and approximately 75% of that of purified native CVF. Recently, we developed a human C3 derivative capable of forming stable C3 convertases in human serum with a half-life in the range of 5­6 h similar to that of CVF [9]. This derivative provided evidence for the fact that substitution of the C-terminal region in the hC3 molecule by the corresponding CVF sequence is sufficient for conferring an inherent molecular stability to the C3-dependent convertase complex. Although this derivative, hC3-DIII, exhibits a

54

homology of approximately 91% to hC3, for therapeutic approaches a further reduction of non-human sequences would be desirable to minimize the potential immunogenicity. Furthermore, the CVF-derived sequence conferred also fluid phase C5 convertase activity, that is exerted exclusively by the CVF-dependent, but not by the C3-dependent convertase [23], to derivative DIII in the range of 20%. Nevertheless, a further reduction or even elimination would be favorable since the deposition of anaphylatoxin C5a is known to cause severe tissue damage [24,25]. Although in hC3-DIV a 116 amino acid sequence has been replaced by the corresponding CVF-derived sequence, only 66 out of 1653 amino acids are of foreign origin, corresponding to a sequence identity of 96%. Accordingly, the immunogenicity of the hC3 derivative can be assumed to be very low to negligible. Therapeutic antibodies generally provide between 65 and 95% human origin [26­28], and even the administration of an anti-C5 scFv containing murine CDR and artificial linker sequences was found to be well tolerated and did not provoke any immune response [29,30]. Furthermore, the high identity of hC3-DIV to the high abundance serum protein hC3 provides additional important advantages with regard to pharmacokinetics and safety. The short C-terminal sequence derived from the non-toxic CVF [31,32], is unlikely to affect neither the safety nor the biochemical characteristics of the molecule. Utilizing mammalian cells for the expression of hC3-DIV the glycosylation pattern can be assumed to be similar to that of hC3. Since glycosylation plays an important role for the half-life of serum proteins [33,34], hC3DIV is likely to provide a half-life sufficient for effective complement depletion in vivo. The catalytic mode of action represents the most important advantage of the novel hC3 derivative. Currently available complement inhibitors, blocking defined components of the complement cascade, need to be administered in stoichiometric amounts. Comparative animal studies with CVF and selected blocking agents revealed an effective dose of CVF that is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of blocking agents [35,36]. Therefore, the hC3 derivative probably will require much lower concentrations for effective decomplementation. The exact risks associated with catalytical complement inhibition in man via the novel hC3 derivatives are not known. The generation of the anaphylatoxic peptides C3a and C5a accompanying complement activation could be controlled by repeated injections of low doses of these derivatives. Furthermore, derivative DIV exhibits very low C5 convertase activity, and the relative biological activity of C3a for certain responses has been reported to be at least 10-fold lower than that of C5a [25]. It is known, that complement deficiencies are associated with increased susceptibility to infection and with autoimmunity. Such complications would be likely to arise only when total complement inhibition was necessary to achieve therapeutical benefit. However, studies have shown that even 60% inhibition of complement is sufficient to provide therapeutic benefit in collagen-induced arthritis [37]. In the additional derivatives DV and DVI the further

reduction of the non-human sequences resulted in inactive molecules as revealed by complement consumption analyses of supernatants of transient expressions. Apparently, a certain stretch of the C-terminal domain of CVF is essential for the generation of an architecture which provides tight binding of Bb. Although the precise molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated, sequence analysis revealed the presence of a C345 domain in the C-terminal 116 amino acids of CVF as shown in Fig. 1. The N-terminus of this domain includes 15 additional amino acids, however, since 11 of these amino acids are identical and further two replaced conservatively, only 98 of the 113 amino acids have been substituted. The corresponding C-terminal stretch of C3 is known to contain this conserved C345C or NTR domain [38]. This domain is also present in the C-terminus of C4 and C5, and homologous modules have been found in other proteins including netrins and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) throughout a variety of species [39­42]. As revealed by structural analyses the C345C module is characterized by a high content of beta-sheets, which in C3 and C5 additionally are stabilized by three internal disulfide bonds [43]. The importance of amino acid residues within the C345C domain of C5 for proteolytic activation by the classical pathway C5 convertase [44,45] suggests that these residues in C5­C345C contribute to the contact between C5 and the convertase. Potentially, this domain may contribute also to the stabilization of the C3 convertases of the alternative pathway. The capability of the hC3 derivatives of forming of stable convertases apparently is associated with the maintained integrity of the CVF-derived C345C module, while the constructs containing a hybrid module (DV) or no C345C domain (DVI) fail in forming a stable convertase. Interestingly, in both the C3derived as well as the CVF-derived module the 6 cysteine residues for disulfide-bridging are retained and the overall structure may be similar. Recombinant expression of C345C domains of CVF and hC3 for interaction analysis with different complement components as performed for the C345C domains of C5 and C3 [46] may help to further dissect the mechanism of convertase stabilization.
