Ê Crystallization and 2.2 A resolution structure of R-phycoerythrin from Gracilaria chilensis: a case of perfect hemihedral twinning
R-phycoerythrin, a light-harvesting component from the red algae Gracilaria chilensis, was crystallized by vapour diffusion using ammonium sulfate as precipitant agent. Red crystals Ê grew after one week at 293 K and diffracted to 2.70 A resolution. Three serial macroseeding assays were necessary to grow a second larger crystal to dimensions of 0.68 Â 0.16 Â Ê 0.16 mm. This crystal diffracted to 2.24 A resolution using synchrotron radiation at beamline BM14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at Grenoble, France and was used for structure determination. Data were collected at 100 K to a completeness of 98.6%. The crystal was trigonal, space group R3, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 187.3, Ê c = 59.1 A,  =  = 90,  = 120 . Data treatment using the CCP4 suite of programs indicated that the crystal was twinned (hI2i/hIi2 = 1.41). Molecular replacement was performed with AMoRe using the R-phycoerythrin from Polysiphonia urceolata [Chang et al. (1996), J. Mol. Biol. 249, 424±440] as a search model. In order to overcome the twinning problem, SHELX97 was used for the crystallographic re®nement. The twin fraction was 0.48, indicating a nearly perfect hemihedrally twinned crystal. The ®nal Rwork and Rfree factors are 0.16 and 0.25, respectively. All the residues and chromophores of the - and -chains are well de®ned in the electron-density maps. Some residues belonging to the -linker are also recognizable.

1. Introduction
Phycobiliproteins (PBPs) are brilliantly coloured highly ¯uorescent proteins formed by an apoprotein bound to a linear tetrapyrrolic prosthetic chromophore (Glazer, 1989). The PBPs are present in cyanobacteria, blue±green and red algae, where they are organized in a macromolecular complex, the phycobilisome (PBS; Gantt, 1981). Three main proteins compose the PBS: phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC) and allophycocyanin (APC). In addition, several colourless linker proteins are found in this macromolecular array. The main function of PBS is light harvesting and energy transfer to the photoreaction centres (Kursar et al., 1983). Each PBP may contain one or more of four speci®c chromophores called phycoerythrobilin (PEB), phycocyanobilin (PCB), phycobiliviolin (PXB) and phycourobilin (PUB), covalently linked to cysteine residues through a thioether bond. The various PBPs are highly homologous and probably originated from a common ancestor (Apt et al., 1995). The PBS of G. chilensis, a red eukaryotic algae, contains the three proteins R-phycoerythrin (R-PE), R-phycocyanin (R-PC) and R-allophycocyanin (R-APC) (Bunster et al., 1997). In the blue±green algae Porphyridium sordidum,

B-phycoerythrin (B-PE) is made up of three  heterodimers plus a -subunit that has been considered as a linker protein (LR) responsible for the packing of the phycobilisome (Ficner & Huber, 1993). B-PE has two PEBs per -chain and two PEBs and a PUB per -chain (Glazer, 1989). The structures of B-PE from Porphyridium sordidum and Porphyridium Ê cruentum have been solved to 2.3 A (Ficner et al., 1992) and Ê resolution (Ficner & Huber, 1993), respectively. At the 2.2 A beginning of the present project there were no R-PE structures reported. There are now two PE structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank: R-PE from Polysiphonia urceolata at Ê 2.8 A resolution (PDB code 1lia) solved by Chang et al. (1996) Ê and R-PE from Grif®thsia monilis at 1.9 A resolution (PDB code 1b8d) solved by Ritter et al. (1999). For a review on PBPs, see Glazer (1989) and Betz (1997). Here, we report the crystallization, molecular-replacement structure solution and crystallographic re®nement of Gracilaria chilensis R-PE from a merohedrally twinned crystal (Koch, 1992; Redinbo & Yeates, 1993). There are few reported examples of structures solved from twinned crystals in macromolecular crystallography and all of them correspond to hemihedral twins (Yeates, 1997; Yeates & Fam, 1999). Molecular replacement is a good approach to solve a structure in Ê the case of a `perfect twin' (domain ratio 9 0.5; Valegard et al., 1998; Chandra et al., 1999).

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Protein purification

The proteins were extracted from fresh algae (Gantt et al., 1979; Bunster et al., 1997). Three coloured PBPs were resolved by anion-exchange chromatography (TSK-GEL DEAE-5PW 15 Â 21.5 mm ID, Tosohaas) with a HPLC system (BIO LC, Dionex). The column was equilibrated with 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 M sodium chloride. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Micro BCA Protein Assay, Pierce; Smith et al., 1985). The purity and homogeneity of the fractions was analyzed by SDS and native PAGE (PhastGel, Homogeneous 20/2±150 kDa, Pharmacia).
2.2. Crystallization

Crystals were grown by the vapour-diffusion method using sitting-drop insets (Linbro plates, DROP, SA). 1 ml of 16±18 % saturation ammonium sulfate solution in 200 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.0, 500 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM potassium chloride and 15 mM sodium azide was used in the reservoir. The drops were formed by mixing 12±15 mg mlÀ1 protein with reservoir solution in either 1:1 or 2:1 ratios. Red crystals appeared after 3±4 d and continued to grow for three weeks at 294 K as hexagonal rods to dimensions of 0.30 Â 0.04 Â 0.04 mm. After three serial macroseeding assays spanning a period of three weeks, crystals grew to maximum dimensions of 0.68 Â 0.16 Â 0.16 mm.
2.3. Data collection and spacegroup assignment

They are compared with homologous sequences of Polysiphonia boldii (polbo, model sequence); G. monilis (grimo) and Porphyridium sordidum (porso) by a multiple-sequence alignment (PIMA1.4) (Smith & Smith, 1992). The conserved changes are shown in blue and the non-conserved changes in red.

The crystals were soaked in a cryoprotective solution containing 40%(v/v) glycerol in the crystallization mother liquor and cooled to 100 K. A data set was collected from a crystal of dimensions 0.4 Â 0.1 Â 0.1 mm Ê to 2.7 A resolution at the ID9 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) using a CCD detector. Data from a second larger crystal was Ê collected to 2.2 A resolution at BM14 of the ESRF using a

These data were indexed using XDS98 (Kabsch, 1993) and HKL2000 (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and were reduced using the CCP4 set of programs (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The space group R3 was assigned for both crystals directly by XDS98 and HKL2000. To check this space-group assignment, the hk0 and hk3 planes were generated using HKLVIEW (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).

Both data sets were analyzed using CCP4 programs (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The Stanley factor hI2i/hIi2 (Stanley, 1972; Yeates, 1997) and Wilson's diffraction distribution (Wilson, 1949) were obtained from TRUNCATE (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).
2.5. Molecular replacement and refinement

Molecular replacement was carried out with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using the R-PE ()2 atomic coordinates of Chang et al. (1996) (PDB code 1lia). As the amino-acid sequence of G. chilensis R-PE was not available at this time, the sequence of the R-PE from Polysiphonia boldii (Roell & Morse, 1993) was initially used. This was considered a reasonable option given the high (>80%) homology generally observed between phycoerythrins (Apt et al., 1995) (Fig. 1). SHELX97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997) was used for the crystallographic re®nement (TWIN and BASF options). To calculate Rfree, the test re¯ections were selected in thin resolution shells; to avoid possible correlations introduced by the twinning, all the twin-related pairs belonged to either the reference or the working set (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). Five conjugate-gradient cycles were performed in each step of the re®nement. Chromophore-de®nition restraints and watermolecule assignments were performed using SHELX97 (SHELXPRO and SWAT, respectively). Omit maps were systematically used during model building in order to minimize the strong model bias of phases calculated from the molecular-replacement solution (McRee, 1999a). The omit maps were calculated after SHELX97 re®nement and examined with TURBO-FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1989) and XtalView/X®t v4.0.7 (McRee, 1999b) on a graphics workstation. At advanced levels of the re®nement, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (NCSY option) were introduced between homologous chains (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). The stereochemical parameters were checked with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and WHAT IF (Vriend, 1990).

solved through macroseeding and the addition of sodium and potassium chloride. The best results were obtained by three successive macroseeding steps in the presence of 0.4±0.5 M NaCl (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, nucleation was reduced by about 50%. On the other hand, the use of potassium chloride improved the overall aspect of the crystals. The homogeneity of the protein sample, from both the original solution and dissolved crystals, was veri®ed by gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of the bands observed using SDS±PAGE (Fig. 3) were those expected for - and

-chains (17±18 kDa) and for the -chain (30 kDa) (Glazer, 1985; Ficner & Huber, 1993, Ducret et al., 1996). However, there is an unexpected band of about 14 kDa observed in both the original protein solution and dissolved crystals that could be a previously unreported R-PE protein linker (LR). Two small linkers of 7 and 10 kDa have been described for APC of Synechocystis sp. PCC6714 which may correspond to LC and LR, respectively (Ajlani & Vernotte, 1998). Similarly, 8.9 kDa LC and LR polypeptides have been reported in the case of the cyanobacterium phycobilisome (Ducret et al., 1996). Further characterization of the 14 kDa band is under way.

Ê As indicated above, the indexing of the 2.7 and 2.2 A resolution data indicated that the crystals belong to the R3 space group. Statistical analysis using TRUNCATE (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) Ê showed hI2i/hIi2 ratios of 1.41 and 3.18 for the 2.2 and 2.7 A resolution data sets, respectively, suggesting the presence of hemihedral twinning in the former; it has been determined that the hI2i/hIi2 ratio should be about 2.0 for untwinned data and 1.5 for twinned data (Stanley, 1972; Yeates, 1997). In hemihedral twinned crystals there are two parallel domains, h1 and h2, related by an extra symmetry operation that makes

both domains contribute to the diffraction pattern by Iobs = I(h1) + (1 À )I(h2), where  corresponds to the domain-fraction contribution or `twin fraction'. Until recently, twinning of protein crystals had seldom been reported (Redinbo & Yeates, 1993). Usually, the twinned crystals were discarded or the twin went undetected and the structure was solved with some dif®culty (Luecke et al., 1998; Ibuka et al., 1999; Esposito et al., 1999; Yusupov et al., 1999). In the last few years, however, there have been several reports on structures È solved from twinned protein crystals (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1995; Ê Ä Ito et al., 1995; Valegard et al., 1998; Frazao et al., 1999; Yeates & Fam, 1999; Breyer et al., 1999; Dumas et al., 1999; Chandra et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2000). R3 is a fairly common true space group for twinned crystals Ê (Sweet et al., 1977; Ficner et al., 1992; Ritter, 1999; Valegard et al., 1998). A perfect hemihedral twinned crystal in the R3

space group can be erroneously indexed as R32, as the only possible twin symmetry operator for R3, k, h, Àl, generates a twofold axis on the diagonal between the a and b axes (Chandra et al., 1999). Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) depict a comparison of hk3 planes for our untwinned and twinned data. The pattern in Fig. 4(a) shows the true threefold symmetry along the l axis (R3, trigonal indexing). For twinned data, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the twin operation generates an approximate sixfold axis that underlies the threefold symmetry. There is, however, no true twofold axis in the diagonal between the a and b axes as required in R32. In addition, the Matthews Ê number (VM; Matthews, 1968) of 2.52 A3 DaÀ1 also indicates that the R3 space group assignment is correct (Table 1); VM Ê values below 1.68 A3 DaÀ1 are found when the assigned symmetry is higher than the correct symmetry (Redinbo & Yeates, 1993). Examination of the untwinned and twinned data using the graphic representation of Tong & Rossman (1990) for = 180 with the program GLRF (Tong & Rossman, 1990) indicates, as expected, the presence of twofold axes perpendicular to the unique axis and separated by 60 in 2. The twofold axes do not

coincide with the a, b and diagonal axes but are misaligned by about À4.5 relative to these directions (Fig. 5a). In the case of the twinned crystal, the maxima are found at the special values 2 = 0, 60, 120 etc (Fig. 5b). This may be explained if the twin operation is a rotation about the (a + b) diagonal so that the resulting 2 values are the mean of the two components of the twin. (For instance, the 0 value would result from the superposition of the twofold axes located at À4.5 and 4.5 .) There is also a small peak at 2 = 90 and 9 = 90 (along the c axis) and = 180 , which may result from the similarities between the - and -subunits and/or the pseudo-sixfold axis (Chandra et al., 1999).

In the case of a perfect hemihedral twin there is no problem in ®nding the two possible molecular-replacement solutions and either one may be used (Redinbo & Yeates, 1993; Breyer et al., Ê 1999). For the 2.7 A resolution untwinned data, AMoRe proposed two solutions to the cross-rotation function [Eulerian angles (64, 91, 82 ) and (64, 89, 262 )] related by 180 corresponding to the twofold axis relating the two  dimers in the asymmetric unit. In the Ê case of the 2.2 A resolution twinned data, four solutions were found [Eulerian angles (57, 89, 263 ), (57, 91, 83 ), (63, 90, 83 ) and (63, 91, 263 )], two for each twin domain. The solution with the highest score correlation coef®cient of 0.494 and R factor of 0.355 was used for the molecular replacement. Analysis of SHELX97 results after the ®rst round of re®nement showed that the R-PE crystal is a perfect hemihedral specimen (Table 1).

Because at later stages in re®nement only small differences were detected between the side-chain conformations of homologous polypeptide chains, the NCSY approach was used. NCSY signi®cantly reduced the Rwork and Rfree factors. In this work, we have assumed that the primary structure of G. chilensis R-PE is very similar to that of R-PE from Polysiphonia boldii (Roell & Morse, 1993) (Fig. 1). All the PBPs present a high degree of amino-acid sequence and structure similarities (Fig. 1), with a high -helix content and the same globin-like folding pattern (Ducret et al., 1994; Apt et al., 1995; Brejc et al., 1995). An extensive sequence-alignment and evolutionary analysis has been performed by Apt et al. (1995). Visual inspection of the G. chilensis R-PE ()2 heterodimer cast doubts in a few cases concerning the amino-acid sequence assigned by homology. To con®rm the observed amino-acid sequence differences, omit maps were calculated and aminoacid sequence analysis was initiated (Fig. 1). This analysis showed high identity with other reported PEs but also con®rmed the changes detected in the electron-density maps.
3.4. Structure

The  and  polypeptide chains are composed of nine helical segments called X, Y, A, B, E, F, F H , G and H (Fig. 6; Schirmer et al., 1985). In the crystal, there is a hexamer consisting of two (33) trimers related by a crystallographic twofold axis (Fig. 7). Structure re®nement carried out using SHELX97 converged to an Rwork of 0.16 and an Rfree of 0.25 (Table 1). These values are signi®cantly lower than the Rwork of 0.34 and Rfree of 0.35 we obtained with CNS 0.3c (Brunger et al., 1998) when the twinning was not taken into account. For statistical reasons, the difference between Rwork and Rfree factors can be higher than usual in the presence of a twin (Redinbo & Yeates, 1993; Luecke et al., 1998). Consequently, special care was taken to keep this difference relatively small (Kleywegt & Jones, 1997). Inspection of the electron-density maps indicated that R-PE from G. chilensis and PE from P. boldii (Roell & Morse, 1993) have the same number of amino acids (164 and 177 in the - and -chains, respectively). The stereochemical parameters of the R-PE model fall within the expected values for a well re®ned structure (residue distribution: most favoured, 93.6%; additional allowed, 6.1%; disallowed, 0.3%; Laskowski et al., 1993; see Table 1). As in other PBSs, only Thr75 falls outside of allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot (not shown); this is because this residue interacts with one of the chromophores. The residues 146±152 in -chains present very poor electrondensity map de®nition. This area corresponds to an exposed loop in -chains between the G and H helixes. The assigned Gly151 is in agreement with the idea of a more ¯exible loop (highest B value) than those reported in 1lia (Val151) and 1b8d (Val151). The commonly reported Asn72 N-methylation in R-PEs became clear as re®nement progressed and Asn72 was modi®ed Figure 8 according to the electron density. As Stereoview of (a) 84PEB and (b) 50/61PUB chromophore electron-density maps 2Fobs À Fcalc expected, none of the changes detected in contoured at the 1.0' level.

overall folding. The root-mean-square deviations for all mainchain atoms between the R-PEs of G. chilensis and Polysiphonia urceolata and Grif®thsia monilis were 2.91 and Ê 2.84 A, respectively. The chromophores were easily recognizable in the electrondensity maps calculated after initial re®nement cycles (Fig. 8). They correspond to two PEB in the -chain and two PEB plus one PUB in the -chain (Fig. 6), con®rmed by omit maps. In PEB (Fig. 9) the A, B and C rings are co-planar but the D rings deviate from the plane. In PUB only the B and C rings are in the same plane (Table 2). Their con®guration, orientation, inter-chromophore distances and the interaction of chromophores with neighboring residues are similar to that found in the R-PEs of P. urceolata (Chang et al., 1996) and G. monilis (Ritter et al., 1999). The -chain (LR) is localized in the inner cavity and in the case of R-PE sits on the crystallographic threefold axis. This implies that the -chain has only a 1/3 occupancy, which means a weaker density map in the area. However, in our maps some residual electron densities could be recognized close to ring D of 82PEB far from the threefold axis. These residual densities indicated the presence of a short -helix segment and a long lateral chain close to ring D of 82PEB with partial occuÊ pancies of 0.2±0.6. The 2.2 A resolution APC structure of Mastigoclaudus laminosus was solved from orthorhombic crystals, space group P212121, and presents a LC chain of 7.8 kDa (APC-L7X8 ) (Reuter et al., 1999). A rigid-body alignC ment of the APC-L7X8 (PDB code 1b33) and R-PE of C G. chilensis indicated the presence of residual density in our map that matched the main -helix present in the former. Owing to this structural alignment, two 180 -related -helixes with sequences Ala-Ala-Phe-Arg-Ala-Ala close to the 1 subunit and Ala-Phe-Arg-Ala-Ala close to the 6 subunit could be assigned to the density and re®ned. The Phe and Arg residues were conserved from the original APC-L7X8 sequence. C The position of Phe is close to that proposed to be a Tyr residue in -chain R-PE of G. monilis. In the case of R-PE from P. urceolata, a residual density close to 82PEB was also modeled as a Phe (Jiang et al., 1999). An amino-acid sequence alignment between APC-L7X8 and the R-PE Aglaothamnion C neglectum -chain (Apt et al., 1993) did not reveal any similarities. However, a pattern of at least three Phe residues ¯anked by positively charged residues could be observed. Finally, the environment around ring D of 82PEB with Phe and Arg residues is similar to that found close to 82PEB except for one missing aromatic residue from the linker.

4. Conclusions
The crystal struture of R-phycoerythrin has been determined Ê in the R3 space group. The initial data set at 2.7 A resolution was used to solve the structure with the molecularÊ replacement method. Subsequently, a data set to 2.2 A resolution was collected from a different crystal. Although this crystal also displayed R3 symmetry, its diffraction data showed an intensity distribution that indicated merohedral twinning. The higher symmetry of space group R32, expected owing to the twinning, was not found because of the slight misalignment of the twin axis relative to the (a + b) diagonal axis. Thus, only a pseudo-sixfold axis was observed in the hk3 plane. Ê The 2.2 A resolution re®ned model shows good stereochemistry. The molecule has structural features similar to those described for R-PE of P. urceolata (PDB code 1lia) and G. monilis (PDB code 1b8d). The interpretation of weak electron densities has led us to propose the presence of a helical segment of linker protein in the central channel of R-PE.
