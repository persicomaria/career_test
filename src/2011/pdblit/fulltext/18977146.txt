We discuss the accuracy of fragmentation in fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations for the hydrated sodium ion. Two-body expansion shows a considerable error in total energy even if water molecules in the second hydration shell are included in the same fragment as the sodium ion. Inclusion of the three-body term significantly improves both the total energy and the charge distributions. We also illustrate the dependence of the net charge of sodium ion on solvent size and the interfacial property of water molecules. The present study will thus provide fundamental information about hydrated ion to facilitate further theoretical and experimental studies. Ó 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Solvents play important roles in the stability and function of biomolecules, for example, in protein folding, ligand binding and enzymatic reactions. Protein solvation has been studied extensively using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that employ empirical force-field parameters [1,2]. Furthermore, in MD simulations, sodium ions are widely used as counterions for neutralization of the unit cell under periodic boundary conditions. However, empirical force fields cannot appropriately deal with various effects such as charge transfer and polarization while polarizable force fields are possible choices for more reliable calculations [3­5]. Therefore, the problem should be treated more rigorously by ab initio quantum mechanical methods. The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method is a promising method to treat large systems with chemical reliability [6­27]. (See Ref. [27] for recent theoretical developments and their applications.) The FMO method has also been used in the study of solvent effects on biomolecules [11,17,18,20,21,23­26]. Fedorov et al. have combined the polarizable continuum model with FMO to incorporate the solvent effects in an implicit manner [17]. Ishikawa et al. [18] introduced the model core potential in the FMO method in order to treat heavy metal ions. They performed the calculations for a cisplatin­DNA complex surrounded by water with sodium ions and for hydrated mercury, taking electron correlations

into account. Komeiji et al. have studied the changes in the electronic structure of ubiqutin [20] in the presence and absence of explicit water molecules. Fragment Molecular Orbital-based Molecular Dynamics (FMO-MD) is an ab initio molecular dynamics method based on the FMO method [11,26]. The FMO-MD is applied to the conformation sampling of formaldehyde in a solvent [21], the direct simulation of hydrolysis of methyl diazonium cation [23], and the comparison of free energy profiles of the Menschutkin reaction in the presence and absence of the solvent [25]. Recently, cluster hydration model is proposed for predicting the binding affinity in protein­ligand complexes based on an explicit solvent treatment using the FMO method [24]. Such attempts would further elucidate the role of water and ions in biological systems. Despite the many applications, the treatment of hydrated ions in the framework of the FMO scheme has not been well reported. Previous studies have shown that charge distributed on alkali metal cations would not be equal to unity due to the presence of charge transfer between ions and water molecules [28­31]. In such cases, assignment of the ion as one independent fragment may cause a significant error. Therefore, a question arises regarding how far water molecules from hydrated ions should be included in the same fragments containing the central ion. The purpose of the present study is to systematically evaluate the accuracy of fragmentation of hydrated Naþ in the FMO scheme. Since full geometry optimization of a large system in the presence of aqueous solution is very expensive, we prepared input structures for FMO calculations through force-field simulations as performed in previous studies [18,20]. In the FMO method, the total energy of a molecule or a molecular cluster divided into N fragments is expanded as follows:

Case 3: RIJ < Ldimer-es and RJK ; RIK P Ldimer-es . Case 4: RIJ ; RJK ; RIK ! Ldimer-es . Here, RIJ denotes the shortest interatomic distance between the atoms in the monomer I and J in units of the van der Waals radius. Three-body interaction energies decrease rapidly as the case number above increases (from Cases 1 to 4). In the present FMO3 calculations, we considered only Case 1 for the three-body interaction energies. In this way, we can prevent the two-body interaction energies calculated by the dimer-es approximation from being included in the three-body interaction energies. Fedorov and Kitaura [14] have shown that the consistency of ESPs between the dimer and trimer is crucial for accurate FMO3 calculations. Thus, we applied only the Mulliken population approximation [10] for all the ESPs in the present implementation based on ABINIT-MP [8] software. 2.2. Configurations of water molecules around Naþ We performed two classical MD simulations for different purposes. One was for the calculation of the radial distribution function between Naþ and water molecules, and the other was for the preparation of input structures for FMO calculations. Fig. 1a schematically shows these procedures. The force-field parameters used were TIP3P for water molecules [32] and OPLSAA for the À Naþ and Cl [33]. Lennard-Jones parameters ðr; Þ in units of Å À were (3.3304, 0.0028) and and kcal/mol for Naþ and Cl (4.4100, 0.1180), respectively. We employed the Lorentz­Berthelot À mixing rules to model the Naþ --O and Cl --O Lennard-Jones interactions. Before performing FMO calculations, we analyzed the distribution of water molecules around Naþ by calculating the radial distribution function between Naþ and the water molecules. We performed the MD simulation under periodic boundary conditions.

Here, EI , EIJ and EIJK refer to the energies of the monomer, dimer and trimer, respectively. In Eq. (1) the FMO expansion including trimers is denoted by FMO3 (three-body expansion), and that without the last sum involving the trimer contributions defines FMO2 (twobody expansion). Most FMO calculations have been based on FMO2 while FMO3 yields greater accuracy but is more expensive [12­14,19]. Fedorov and Kitaura [12] remarked that FMO2 shows considerable errors in hydrogen-bonded systems. Because the energy of the monomer includes polarization energy at the manybody level [6], a large part of the energy error of FMO2 is due to many-body charge transfer. The many-body charge transfer may also be important in systems containing hydrated ions. In the present study, we discuss the accuracy of fragmentation in the FMO2 and FMO3 calculations for the hydrated sodium ion system. We use the term of `accuracy of fragmentation' to refer to how well the FMO calculations employing the fragmentation scheme reproduce the energies and the electronic properties calculated by the conventional MO methods. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we first describe the approximations in FMO3 method. Then, we show the procedures of preparation of input structures for FMO calculations and those for the evaluation of the accuracy of fragmentation. In Section 3, we analyze the structural features of hydrated Naþ demonstrated by the radial distribution function and the coordination number. Then, total energy errors and Mulliken charges on Na and oxygen atoms are illustrated. We also discuss the dependence on solvent size and the interfacial properties of water molecules. Conclusions on the main results are summarized in Section 4. 2. Method 2.1. Approximations in FMO3 method Here, we briefly describe the approximations employed in the FMO calculations. (See Ref. [14] for more detailed discussion.) The total energy of the system, Eq. (1), is rewritten as follows:

The unit cell included 3977 water molecules and 1 NaCl. Longrange electrostatic interactions were calculated by the particle mesh Ewald method. We used the Beeman algorithm for the integration method. A time step of 2 fs was employed, and Berendsen's coupling algorithm was used to maintain constant temperature. The time constants for heat bath coupling were 0.5 and 5.0 ps for equilibration and production runs, respectively. Hydrogen atoms were constrained at their ideal positions using the RATTLE algorithm. We used TINKER software [34] for these simulations. An equilibration run of 100 ps was followed by a production run of 1 ns in the NVT ensemble at the temperature of 300 K. Configurations of hydrated Naþ as the input for the quantum mechanical calculations were obtained as follows. First, for MD simulation, we prepared a system in which a hydrated Naþ was located at the origin of the water droplet, containing 3588 water molecules. In order to maintain the droplet boundary condition, water molecules outside a distance of 35 Å from the origin were forced towards the origin. The Naþ was restrained to the origin by the harmonic potential. Other conditions were the same as those mentioned above. We performed energy minimization after MD simulation in order to obtain a local minimum configuration. Sets of Naþ with water molecules within each distance were excised from the final configuration and used as the inputs for FMO calculations. For the calculations of the distance between the Naþ and water molecules, we defined the locations of water molecules as those of their oxygen atoms. 2.3. Procedure for evaluation of fragmentation accuracy We employed the following procedures to evaluate the accuracy of the fragmentation of hydrated Naþ in the FMO calculations. We used a structure in which 155 water molecules were located within a radius of 10 Å around a central Naþ . This structure was treated by the FMO method with the different fragmentation schemes described below. The central fragment was defined as the Naþ and water molecules within a distance R from the Naþ . The case of R = 0 Å indicated the assignment of the Naþ as one fragment, and R = 10 Å corresponded to the conventional MO calculation. When the distance of hydrogen bond (intermolecular O­H distance) was 2.0 Å or less, all the pertinent water molecules were treated as one fragment. Fig. 1b schematically shows these fragmentation schemes. Total energies and Mulliken atomic charges of the Na atom were calculated with each fragmentation scheme and compared with those obtained by the conventional MO method. We performed all the quantum mechanical calculations at the Hartree­Fock level. The FMO and MO calculations were performed using the ABINIT-MP package. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.

the second hydration shell) in the following. Six water molecules were located within 3 Å from Naþ in the local minimum structure; thus, a fragmentation of R = 3 Å included all water molecules in the first hydration shell. 3.2. Dependence of total energy and Naþ charge on the fragment size Table 1 shows the total energy errors of the FMO calculations compared with the conventional MO method. Minus signs on errors indicate that total energies calculated by FMO are lower than the MO values. FMO2 tends to underestimate the total energies (À107.2 to À65.4 kcal/mol). The results of FMO2 show considerable errors, even if the largest fragmentation of R = 6 Å was employed. FMO3, which includes the three-body term, improved the errors of total energies drastically (0.2­5.6 kcal/mol). These results indicate the importance of the three-body term (the three-body

Fig. 2 shows the radial distribution function (RDF) between Naþ and oxygen and the thermal average of the coordination number of Naþ (integration of RDF). The coordination number of the local minimum structure is also displayed, which is close to the thermal average, indicating that it represents the main characteristics of the hydration structure of Naþ . From the RDF, we define the first and second hydration shells of Naþ as 2 Å < R < 3.2 Å and 3.2 Å < R < 5.9 Å, respectively. The average number of water molecules in the first hydration shell is 5.9 (integration up to 3.2 Å), thus illustrating that the most probable coordination number of Naþ is six. These results are in agreement with other experiments [35,36], force-field simulations [37] and ab initio studies [28]. We examined the accuracy of fragmentation from R = 0 Å (assigning Naþ as one fragment) to R = 6 Å (including water molecules up to

charge transfer) in hydrogen-bonded systems as found previously by Fedorov and Kitaura [12]. As for the case of the 6-31G* basis set, for example, the total energy error of FMO3 with combination of fragmentation of R = 0 Å is 1.7 kcal/mol, which is significantly improved compared with À65.4 kcal/mol obtained by FMO2 with fragmentation of R = 6 Å. The total energy errors of the FMO3 are almost independent of the fragment size. This fact implies that the effect of hydration can be taken into account virtually by including the water molecules in the first hydration shell in the FMO3 calculations. On the other hand, those of the FMO2 are improved with increasing fragment size, which is due to the improved description of many-body charge transfer between water molecules included in the central fragment. Then, we investigate the accuracy of the dimer-es and Mulliken population approximations, employing the example with the fragmentation of R = 0 and 3 Å. In the FMO3, the differences of results obtained with the Mulliken population approximation (esp-aoc) and without the ESP approximation (esp-non) are small (0.3­2.7 kcal/mol). As for the FMO2 with the dimer-es approximation, the energy difference between Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 and 4.0 obtained with the fragmentation of R = 0 and 3 Å are 3.6­4.5 kcal/mol and 0.5­0.7 kcal/mol, respectively. The accuracy of dimer-es approximation with Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 has a satisfactory accuracy when the fragmentation of R = 3 Å is employed. However, their differences obtained by the FMO3 with the fragmentation of R = 0 and 3 Å are 7.2­ 11.4 kcal/mol and 3.3­8.0 kcal/mol, respectively. This result indicates that we should consider the fragment trimers composed of monomers separated by larger than 2.0 in units of the van der Waals radius to take full account of the three-body effect in hydrated Naþ . However, it is thought that the main three-body effects are taken into account because the error of the total energies calculated by FMO3/6-31G* with Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 is small. At least the first hydration shell (R = 3 Å) should be included when the Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 is employed. Table 2 shows the Mulliken charge distributions on the Na atom. The convergence properties of Mulliken charges as a function of the fragment size are observed as follows: For all basis sets used in this study, FMO calculations with fragmentation of R = 6 Å reproduced the results obtained by the conventional MO method

fairly accurately. In the FMO2 method, the charges calculated with smaller fragmentation schemes were smaller (more negative) than those obtained by the conventional MO method and increased with increasing fragment size. It follows that the smaller fragmentation of hydrated Naþ enhances electron donation from the water molecules to the Na atom. With smaller fragmentation, positive charge localizes in the smaller region around the Na atom because there is no charge transfer in the monomer calculations of FMO. This localized positive charge enhanced the electron donation from the water molecules in the dimer calculations. On the other hand, the FMO3 calculations with the fragmentation larger than R = 3 Å reproduce the results of the conventional MO well, showing that the assignment of ion and water molecules in the first hydration shell as one fragment can accurately describe the charge distribution around the ion. The charges of Na calculated by the FMO3 are almost independent of the ESP approximations (the differences by less than 0.02). The differences of charges calculated by the FMO2 with Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 and 4:0 are 0.05­0.06 for the fragmentation of R = 0 Å and less than 0.01 for the R = 3 Å. This result indicates that the dimer-es approximation with Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 is satisfactory for the charge distributions as well as for the total energies in the FMO2 calculations with the fragmentation of R = 3 Å. In the FMO3 calculations, the differences of Mulliken atomic charge of Na between Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 and 4:0 are somewhat large. This shows that the three-body effect is not saturated at Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 as well as in the case of the total energy. The charge transfer from the water molecules to Naþ increases, because the number of dimers and trimers increase when Ldimer-es is increased. Since the number of trimers is greater than that of dimers, the FMO3 method emphasizes this tendency more than the FMO2 method. However, it is supposed that the charge transfer from water molecules is saturated at a constant amount even if the number of surrounding water molecules increases, and a part of decrease in the atomic charge of Na is suspected to be an artifact in the Mulliken population analysis to distribute the half population between pertinent atoms. We also show the results for Mulliken charges of oxygen in order to analyze the charge distribution on the water molecules. Average Mulliken charge distributions on oxygen calculated by FMO2 (see Fig. 3a) and FMO3 (see Fig. 3b) with the 6-31G* basis set are plotted as functions of distance from Na. We calculated the averages of the charges within a range of r ± 0.5 Å. Results of fragmentation at R = 0, 3 and 6 Å are shown. FMO2 tends to overestimate (toward the positive side) the charges on oxygen, while FMO3 improves them. These results show that the FMO3 has improved the charge distribution of water molecules as well as total energy. The average atomic charge of oxygen atoms is increased by 0.1 with increasing distance from the Na atom from 7 to 10 Å, which is due to the effect that the surface of water droplet is exposed to vacuum. Here, we address the computational costs of FMO calculations. All the calculations were performed on the PC cluster using 8 nodes of dual Opteron 2 GHz processors with 4GB memory/CPU connected to 1000Base-T switch. We employ the example with the 6-31G* basis set. Conventional MO calculation took 19.76 h for Naþ with 155 water molecules. The corresponding times for FMO2 with fragmentation schemes of R = 0, 3 and 6 Å were 0.13, 0.23 and 7.66 h, respectively. On the other hand, those for FMO3 with fragmentation of R = 0, 3, and 6 Å were 0.63, 1.20 and 57.42 h, respectively. Large fragmentation schemes (R = 5 and 6 Å) thus require comparable or larger computational costs than those of conventional MO, discarding the merit of the FMO method. For the smaller fragmentations (R = 0, 3, and 4 Å), the computational time for the FMO3 is approximately five times larger than that of the FMO2. As for the threshold value of the dimer-es approximation, the computational times for the FMO2 and the

R = 3 Å compared with R = 0 Å. These arguments indicate that FMO3 with the fragmentation of R = 3 Å and Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 would be the best compromise between accuracy and computational cost. This also shows that the use of the FMO3 method with the fragmentation schemes which assign ion and water molecules in the first hydration shell as one fragment is efficient for the treatment of hydrated ion, while the results for R = 0 Å are not so bad in the case of FMO3. We also examined the dependences of energy errors and Na charges on different local minimum structures (Table 3). Three additional local minimum structures were considered for the fragmentation of R = 3 Å with the 6-31G* basis set. We obtained these structures from a 0.5 ns snapshot of the MD simulation above (MD1) and also from 0.5 and 1.0 ns snapshots of additional MD simulations (MD2). Table 3 shows the results as well as the total number of water molecules and the number of water molecules located within 3 Å of Naþ . Total energy errors of FMO3 are less than 2.0 kcal/mol for all the cases, and an improvement over FMO2 has been confirmed. Moreover, the charge estimation of Na is improved with the error of 0.02 in the FMO3 method, while the deviation from the mean value of conventional MO calculations is 0.09 in the FMO2 method. 3.3. Dependence of Naþ charge on the solvent size In this subsection, we analyze the Mulliken charge on Na as a function of the solvent size and discuss the Mulliken charges of water molecules as a function of the distance from Na. We excised each water sphere from the local minimum configuration as addressed above. All the FMO calculations in this subsection were performed with the fragmentation of R = 3 Å combined with the 6-31G* basis set. Fig. 4 shows the Mulliken charges on Na as functions of the radius of the water sphere. The calculated values of the Mulliken charge converged at around 8 Å. This result is consistent with earlier work reported for hydrated alkali ions by Tanaka and Aida [31] and for divalent mercury ions by Ishikawa et al. [18]. From the results for 20 Å including 1113 water molecules, average Mulliken charges of oxygen (see Fig. 5a) and hydrogen (see Fig. 5b) are plotted as functions of distance from Na. Oxygen and hydrogen near Naþ have more positive charges due to electron donation to Na. We can regard the region from 6 to 15 Å as a bulk phase. The properties of water molecules in this region are similar to those of the bulk phase both structurally (see Fig. 2) and electronically. The Mulliken charges on oxygen and hydrogen of an isolated water

Mulliken charge on the Na atom

FMO3 with the Ldimer-es ¼ 4:0 are larger than those with the Ldimer-es ¼ 2:0 by 2 and 8­10 times, respectively. The FMO calculations with the esp-aoc approximation became 4­5 times faster than those without ESP approximations. We now discuss which combination of methods was the best compromise between the accuracy and the computational cost. FMO2 shows the considerable energy errors. On the other hand, FMO3 with large fragmentation requires longer computation time than conventional MO. Thus, FMO3 with small fragmentation would provide a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost. Relatively small differences between the results of R = 3 and 4 Å concerning energy errors and Na charges imply that R = 3 Å is better for retaining reduced computational time. Also, the influence of the dimer-es approximation is improved for

The errors of FMO methods depend on the systems, their geometries, and the fragmentation schemes. Researchers who employ the FMO methods are suggested to perform test calculations in light of their purposes. We should also note that the results of this study are not always transferable to biological systems. The charge delocalization of Naþ would be reduced in the cases where Naþ is located near some biological molecules. Treatment of such a system by the FMO method requires careful consideration. Our results also yield important suggestions for the treatment of hydrated solutes where many-body charge transfer would be important. The present study will thus provide some fundamental information for further studies by the FMO method. Acknowledgements

Fig. 5. Average Mulliken atomic charges on (a) oxygen and (b) hydrogen as functions of the distance from Na. Both in (a) and (b), the averages of the charges were calculated within a range of r ± 0.5 Å for the water sphere with a radius of 20 Å. The FMO2 (red solid line with circles) and FMO3 (green dashed line with squares) calculations were performed with the central fragment of R = 3 Å and the 6-31G* basis set.

molecule calculated with HF/6-31G* were À0.85 and 0.43, respectively. The water molecules of the liquid phase are thus polarized by surrounding water molecules. We also observed that the interfacial region of water molecules (15­20 Å) is close to the situation for the isolated molecule. The water molecules in the interfacial region are less polarized than those of the bulk phase. These results are consistent with the observations by Komeiji et al. [20]. 4. Conclusion We have discussed the accuracy of fragmentation schemes in ab initio FMO calculations1 of the hydrated Naþ . We demonstrated that FMO2 shows a considerable error in total energies even if larger fragmentation schemes, including the second hydration shell, are employed. FMO3 improved both total energies and Mulliken charges on Na atom and water molecules, because it appropriately describes the many-body effects between molecules. These results clearly show the failure of FMO2 in hydrogen-bonded clusters, and the use of FMO3 is thus essential. The dependence on water sphere size has also been analyzed. In addition, we illustrated the interfacial properties of water molecules. In the present study, the Mulliken population analysis was used for calculating the atomic charges, although its deficiencies are well known. Other population analyses such as natural bond orbital analysis [38] may thus be required to be combined with FMO methods. We may also consider the Cholesky decomposition and continuous multipole method to improve the ESP approximation.
