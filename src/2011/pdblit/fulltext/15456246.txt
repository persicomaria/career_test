New diphenolic azoles as highly selective estrogen receptor- agonists are reported. The more potent and selective analogues of these series have comparable binding affinities for ER as the natural ligand 17 -estradiol but are >100-fold selective over ERR. Our design strategy not only followed a traditional SAR approach but also was supported by X-ray structures of ER cocrystallized with various ligands as well as molecular modeling studies. These strategies enabled us to take advantage of a single conservative residue substitution in the ligand-binding pocket, ERR Met421 f ER Ile373, to optimize ER selectivity. The 7-position-substituted benzoxazoles (Table 5) were the most selective ligands of both azole series, with ERB-041 (117) being >200-fold selective for ER . The majority of ER selective agonists tested that were at least 50-fold selective displayed a consistent in vivo profile: they were inactive in several models of classic estrogen action (uterotrophic, osteopenia, and vasomotor instability models) and yet were active in the HLA-B27 transgenic rat model of inflammatory bowel disease. These data suggest that ER -selective agonists are devoid of classic estrogenic effects and may offer a novel therapy to treat certain inflammatory conditions.
Introduction Estrogens play an essential role in the growth, development, and homeostasis of a diverse range of tissues.1 Estrogens exert their physiological role via estrogen receptors (ER), which function as ligandactivated transcriptional regulators.2 A number of marketed products target estrogen receptors, such as oral contraceptives (e.g., 17R-ethynyl estradiol), hormone therapy agents (e.g., 17 -estradiol, conjugated equine estrogens), and breast cancer therapeutics (e.g., tamoxifen, fulvestrant). The first discovered ER, now called ERR, was cloned in 19863 and was believed to mediate the effects of estrogens solely. However, in 1996, Gustafsson and coworkers discovered a second estrogen receptor during a search for novel nuclear receptors in a rat prostate cDNA library and named it ER .4 The discovery of ER has caused considerable excitement within the scientific community and has provided the motivation to identify

its physiological role in mediating estrogen action. Because the two ER isoforms exhibit overlapping but distinct tissue distribution patterns,5 it appeared likely that an ER -selective ligand would exhibit a pharmacological profile that is different from that of nonselective estrogens such as 17 -estradiol. The fact that ER is widely expressed but not the dominant estrogen receptor in the uterus or breast tissues makes it a very attractive drug target. Both estrogen receptors have distinct domains that are critical to transactivation, DNA binding, and hormone binding. ERR and ER have modest overall sequence identity, differing primarily in their N-terminus domains, with the sequences more conserved at the DNA (95% identity) and ligand-binding domains (LBD) (58% identity).6 Despite the modest sequence identity, the overall structural differences in the ligand-binding pocket are rather small. The X-ray structure of the human ER LBD complexed to genistein6 showed that there are two subtle amino acid differences in close proximity to the bound ligand: ERR Leu384 is replaced by ER Met336, and ERR Met421 is replaced by ER Ile373. Considering this small change in the ligandbinding cavity, it is not surprising that 17 -estradiol displays a similar affinity for both receptors. Despite a large body of mapping studies, in vitro characterization studies, and the creation of knockout mice, the physiological role of ER has remained unclear until recently,7 when the availability of selective ligands helped further the investigation of the physiological function of ER . ER -selective agonist ERB-041 (compound 117, Table 5) was used to demonstrate that this receptor may be a useful target for inflammation,7

whereas other studies utilizing the ERR-selective agonist propylpyrazole triol (PPT) showed that many classical estrogenic effects are mediated primarily by ERR.8 Several groups have investigated a variety of nonsteroidal scaffolds mimicking either the dihydroxyl arrangement of the nonselective estradiol or the moderately ER -selective phytoestrogen genistein as potential selective ER ligands. Although these studies have produced excellent potent ligands for both estrogen receptors, the generation of highly ER -selective ligands has proved to be quite challenging. Naturally occurring phytoestrogens and several modified analogues were reported to possess modest selectivity for the ER receptor (10-40-fold),9 and one series of genistein analogues was claimed to exhibit impressive binding selectivity.10 Diarylpropylnitriles (DPN),11,12 biphenyl compounds,9,13 and benzothiazoles/benzoxazoles14,15 exhibited as much as 70-fold selectivity for ER , whereas other scaffolds, for example, tetrahydrochrysenes (THC),16-18 aryl benzothiophenes,19 isoxazoles,20,21 benzimidazoles,22 triazines,23 benzoxazines,24 and tetrahydrofluorenones,25 have been reported to be on the order of 10-40-fold ER selective.

In this paper, we report the design and synthesis of potent and selective ER ligands initially based on diphenolic benzisoxazole (3) (Figure 1). Compound 3 was identified through a competitive radioligand binding assay screen of our in-house sample collection. It had excellent potency for ER with an IC50 value of 3.5 nM, but it was minimally selective (8-fold) for ER (Table 1). The development of our ligands followed a traditional SAR approach and was supported by X-ray structures of ER cocrystallized with various ligands and molecular modeling studies to expedite the discovery of selective ligands. The finer details of these crystallographic and modeling studies will be reported elsewhere.26 We have primarily concentrated our efforts on the R face of the ER LBD binding pocket, utilizing only one of the amino acid differences (ERR Met421 f ER Ile373) observed when comparing the binding pocket residues of the two ER isoforms. Chemistry Compounds shown in Tables 1-5 were synthesized according to general synthetic procedures (Schemes 1-5). The benzisoxazoles in Tables 1 and 2 were

prepared via the general routes depicted in Schemes 1-3. In Scheme 1, two synthetic routes were used to produce benzisoxazole 8b, using a common intermediate, 6. Arylbromide 4 was first treated with n-butyllithium and then with an appropriately substituted benzaldehyde 5 to produce the addition product, which was oxidized with either manganese dioxide or chromic acid to afford benzophenone 6. In route a, acetone oxime was treated with potassium tert-butoxide, and then benzophenone 6 was added to the mixture to produce

oxime 7. The cyclization of 7 to benzisoxazole 8a was accomplished under acidic conditions with 5% hydrochloric acid in acetonitrile. The demethylation of 8a with either boron tribromide or a mixture of hydriodic acid, acetic anhydride, and acetic acid afforded benzisoxazole 8b. In route b, benzisoxazole 8b was obtained via a more direct approach, where benzophenone 6 was treated with hydroxylamine and sodium hydride in N,N-dimethylformamide to produce 8a, which upon treatment with boron tribromide afforded 8b. In Scheme 2, benzophenone 11a was prepared from benzoyl chloride 9 and 1,4-dimethoxybenzene 10 in the presence of aluminum chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane. The demethylation of 11a with pyridine hydrochloride at high temperatures (200 °C) produced 11b. Benzophenone 11b was converted to benzisoxazole 13 in two steps. First, oxime formation (12) was accomplished with hydroxylamine in ethanol, and second, dehydration of 12 with diethylazodicarboxylate and triphenyl phosphine furnished benzisoxazole 13. Dialkyl analogues 53 and 54 (Table 1) were prepared according to Scheme 3. The treatment of 14a (prepared from the corresponding phenol and chloromethyl methyl ether/NaH) first with tert-butyllithium and second with an appropriately substituted benzaldehyde 14b produced alcohol 15. The dehydroxylation of 15 with triethylsilane in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid furnished phenol 16a. The protection of phenol 16a with iodomethane in the presence of sodium hydride afforded the corresponding anisole 16b, which upon treatment with N-bromosuccinimide in acetonitrile produced bromide 17. The conversion of 17 to benzisoxazole 19 was accomplished according to Scheme 1. The benzoxazoles of Tables 3 and 4 were prepared according to Scheme 4. Dimethoxyaniline 20 was treated with either benzoyl or naphthoyl chloride 21 in the presence of triethylamine to produce amide 22, which was converted to benzoxazole 23 upon treatment with pyridine hydrochloride at high temperatures (200 °C). Bromo analogue 66 (Table 3) was prepared from 63 upon treatment with bromine in acetic acid. The 7-position-substituted benzoxazoles (Table 5) were prepared according to Scheme 5. Nitrophenol 24 was first brominated with Br2/NaOAc in acetic acid and then reduced with H2/Ra-Ni in EtOAc to afford aniline 25b. The coupling of 25b with appropriately substituted benzoyl chloride 26 in the presence of pyridine produced amide ester 27. The conversion of 27 to benzoxazole 28 was accomplished under acidic conditions (p-toluenesulfonic acid) at high temperature (150 °C). The demethylation of 28 with boron tribromide afforded the diphenolic benzoxazole 29. The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction27,28 of benzoxazole 29 with alkyl stannates or aryl boronic acids produced benzoxazoles 30a and 30b. 2-Fluorovinyl analogue 31a was prepared from 30a (R2 ) vinyl) by the initial formation of the 1,2bromofluoroethane adduct of the vinyl group with hydrogen fluoride-pyridine and 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin in sulfolane and subsequent hydrogen bromide elimination with DBU.29 2-Bromovinyl analogue 31b was prepared in three steps from 28 upon vinylation of the 7-position of the benzoxazole nucleus, boron tribromide treatment (resulted in demethylation of the methoxy groups and the bromination of the vinyl group, affording1,2-dibromoethane), and hydrogen bro-

mide elimination by DBU. Methoxy analogue 30c was prepared by the displacement of the bromine of 28 with NaOMe in the presence of CuBr. Ethynyl 32a, cyano 32b, and alkyl analogues 32c were prepared from 28 via a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction using ethynyl(trimethyl)silane, Zn(CN)2, or alkyl zinc chlorides (Rieke reaction),30 respectively, and subsequent demethylation with BBr3. Cyano analogue 32b was also prepared by the displacement of the bromine of 29 with CuCN. Metal halogen exchange of 28 with n-BuLi followed by acetone addition and subsequent treatment with pyridine hydrochloride at high temperature (200 °C) produced benzoxazole 32e. The reduction of 32e with H2/Pd-C furnished isopropyl analogue 32f. 7-Lithiated benzoxazole 28 was also treated with various electrophiles (i.e., EtI, PhMeNCHO, CN-CO2R4) to produce analogue 32d. Compounds 100-102 (Table 5) were successively prepared by standard synthetic protocols from 103 upon reduction (NaBH4, MeOH), bromination (BBr3, CH2Cl2), and nitrile formation (KCN, 18-C-6, DMF). Bromo analogues 135 and 136 (Table 5) were prepared from 117 upon bromination with bromine in acetic acid, whereas bromo analogues 137 and 138 were prepared from 91 upon treatment with N-bromosuccinimide in acetonitrile. Results and Discussion The primary screening assay for the program was a competitive radioligand binding assay,31 which was used

to determine the relative binding affinity (IC50) of compounds for the human ERR and ER LBD. Selected compounds were also evaluated using mouse and rat LBDs as well as full-length human receptors. These data are presented in Tables 1-7. As expected in these assays, radioinert 17 -estradiol bound equally well to ERR and ER . Benzisoxazole Analogues. High-throughput screening-hit benzisoxazole 3 (Figure 1) was successfully cocrystallized with ER (Figure 2a). As shown in Figure 2a and discussed above, there are only two conservative amino acid differences among the residues closest to the ligand, ER Met336 f ERR Leu384 and ER Ile373 f ERR Met421. Benzisoxazole 3 occupies the ligand-binding cavity in an orientation where the hydroxyl group of the benzisoxazole nucleus interacts with the receptor via a hydrogen-bonding network involving the side chains of Glu305 and Arg346 and a buried water molecule, whereas the 4-hydroxyl group of the resorcinol nucleus extends to the distal end of the cavity making a hydrogen-bond interaction with His475. Both of these hydroxyl groups are important to the binding affinity of the compound because the elimination of either hydroxyl group (examples 34, 35; Table 1) proved to be detrimental to the compound's potency. However, the benzisoxazole hydroxyl group appears to be more important to the ligand binding than the 4-hydroxyl group of the resorcinol, given that 34 was 3× less potent than 35. This is consistent with the placement of 3 in the electron

to participate in an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction with the nitrogen of the benzisoxazole nucleus, rendering planarity to the molecule. This intramolecular hydrogen bond is thus likely to act in a manner similar to that of genistein, improving the

potency by increasing the effective lipophilicity. Regioisomeric 5-hydroxy analogues 37 and 38 were more selective for ER but less potent. The examination of the ER complex with 3 suggested that the introduction of groups at positions 2 and 3of the resorcinol nucleus can be directed toward the R face of the ER LBD binding pocket, exploiting the ERR

Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution to achieve greater ER selectivity. To confirm this hypothesis, we prepared 3-chloro analogue 39 and 2-cyano analogue 40 (their fit to the pocket was confirmed by docking calculations), and both were found to be more selective than 3 (27- and 23-fold selective for ER , respectively). These improvements in selectivity are the result of an 11-fold decrease in affinity for ERR versus an 3-fold decrease in affinity for ER in both cases. In comparison, various other groups (entries 41-49) exhibited similar or reduced ER potency and, in most cases, smaller improvements in selectivity compared to 3. The introduction of similar groups at the 5-position of the resorcinol nucleus in compounds 50-52 resulted in compounds similar to 3 in potency but only about 2-fold more selective. Disubstituted alkyl analogues 53 and 54 were similar to 3. Because the A-C ring hydroxyl-hydroxyl distance of 3 is only 10.6 Å compared to the 12-Å distance for genistein, we attempted to extend this distance by replacing the phenyl with a naphthalene to gain more optimal hydrogen-bonding interactions at both ends of the cavity. In addition, because the majority of the ER ligand-binding pocket is hydrophobic in nature, by increasing the ligand size and lipophilicity it was quite reasonable to expect an enhancement in ligand affinity. In fact, bulkier naphthyl analogue 55 (Table 2) had an IC50 value of 1.4 nM for ER . However, this compound was only 8-fold selective for ER . 5-Hydroxyl analogue 56 was 15-fold weaker than 55, whereas bromo analogue 57 and 5-hydroxyl benzisoxazole 58 were almost 60-fold weaker than 55. Regioisomeric 1-naphthalene benzoxazole 59 (Table 2) was 10× less potent than 58, whereas 5-hydroxyl analogue 60 was similar to 55. 7-Hydroxyl analogue 61 was about 600-fold weaker than 60. Even though both the phenyl and naphthyl benzisoxazoles have produced ligands with excellent affinity for the ER receptor, the selectivity against the ERR receptor was only modest (10-30-fold). Our intention was that extension of the phenyl to a naphthalene would preserve the benzisoxazole as the A-B ring, allowing us to use naphthalene substituents to modulate selectivity. Although docking calculations suggested that this was a reasonable outcome, the larger size of 55 relative to that of genistein made it difficult to rank the order of the potential binding modes. Thus, to test the above hypothesis and to help validate our docking calculations, 55 was cocrystallized with ER . As can be seen in Figure 3, the naphthalene now acts as the A-B ring, and the only substitutable position in

proximity to ERR Met421/ER Ile373 is the 7-position of the benzisoxazole. Unfortunately, it appeared to us that substituents introduced at this position to enhance ER selectivity would also tend to have unfavorable interac-

tions with His475, thereby lowering ER affinity. Given this observation, we decided to turn our attention to more promising strategies. The observation that benzisoxazole can occupy either end of the cavity when comparing 3 (Figure 2) with 55 (Figure 3) is similar to what we report below for the benzoxazole series, and thus we defer an explanation for this behavior to the following section. Benzoxazole Analogues. A logical progression in the SAR study was to explore the regioisomeric benzoxazoles rather than the benzisoxazoles. In addition, docking studies suggested that 2-phenyl- and 2-naphthyl-benzoxazoles would provide a greater opportunity to access ERR Met421/ER Ile373. Regioisomeric 6-hydroxylnaphthyl-benzoxazole 62 (Table 3) of benzisoxazole 60 showed a 3-fold decrease of ER potency but was found to be 6× more selective for ER . 6-Hydroxyl analogue 63 was slightly more potent in ER but with weaker selectivity (12-fold) against ERR. 4-Hydroxyl analogues 64 were 500-fold weaker than 62. Halogen analogues 60 and 67 were also weaker, as was 5hydroxyl naphthyl-benzoxazole 68. Docking studies with 62, later confirmed by cocrystallization with ER (Figure 4), suggested that substitu-

tion at the 7-position of the naphthalene would provide the best access to ERR Met421/ER Ile373 to enhance ER selectivity. This binding mode shown in Figure 4 is in contrast to the binding mode of naphthyl benzisoxazole 55, where the naphthalene acts as the A-B ring and occupies the opposite end of the cavity. (See Figure 3 and Discussion below.) Even so, the naphthalene moiety of 62 already fills the pocket near ERR Met421/ER Ile373 so well that there is minimal room left to explore the remainder of the pocket with functional groups. Unfortunately, although the more lipophilic 7-methyl analogue 69 retained the ER potency of 62, the ER

selectivity did not improve significantly. Regioisomeric 2-naphthalene benzoxazole analogues 70 and 71 were only weakly active (IC50 about 500 nM). Similar to the naphthyl-benzisoxazoles, the naphthyl-benzoxazole ligand affinities were also strongly dependent on the dihydroxyl substitution pattern. Small regiosomeric hydroxyl modifications resulted in wide range of potencies, consistent with the critical hydroxyl-mediated anchoring of dihydroxyl ligands to the ER's binding cavity shown in Figure 4. Regioisomeric 6-hydroxyl benzoxazole 72 (Table 4), an analogue of benzisoxazole 3, showed similar ER potency and increased ER selectivity (26-fold). The elimination of the 2-hydroxyl of the resorcinol nucleus (73) resulted in the 15-fold decrease of ER potency, similar to that of benzisoxazole 36. Several other hydroxyl regioisomers (74 and 75) as well as halogensubstituted analogues (76-78) were also found to have a weaker affinity for ER . Bulky substituents (79 and 80) next to the phenolic hydroxyl were detrimental to the potency. As one might expect, the regioisomeric 5-hydroxyl benzoxazoles (81-89) exhibited a similar SAR pattern to that of the 6-hydroxyl benzoxazoles. The docking of benzoxazole 81 to the X-ray crystal structure of benzofuran 9026 (Table 4) bound to ER revealed a nearly perfect superimposition of these two structures (Figure 5). Interestingly, the phenol of 81 is predicted to act as the A ring, in contrast to the orientation of 2-naphthylbenzoxazole 62 (Figure 4), where the benzoxazole acts as the A ring. Similar changes in the binding mode are observed when comparing 81 to benzisoxazole 3 (Figure 2) and, as pointed out above, when comparing benzoxazole 62 to benzisoxazole 55 (Figure 3) and benzisoxazoles 3 and 55 with each other. Clearly, this is a somewhat general phenomenon, which deserves a brief explanation. These "flipping" effects appear to result primarily from interactions between the hydrophobic scaffold and the binding pocket as well as the relative geometric orientation of the hydroxyl groups, both of which in turn affect the way these hydroxyl groups are presented to key hydrogen-bonding residues Glu305, Arg346, and His475. This is consistent with the fact that docking calculations, in conjunction with a molecular mechanics evaluation of the potential binding modes, are generally quite predic-

tive of the X-ray binding modes of these ER ligands. The docking calculations on ER tend to be less predictive mainly with larger ligands such as 55, where the flexibility of the protein is more likely to play an important role in determining the true binding mode. The examination of docked benzoxazole 81 and the X-ray binding mode of 90 revealed that substitutions at the 7-position offered an opportunity to improve the ER selectivity of the phenyl-benzoxazole scaffold by targeting the ERR Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution. In addition, there appeared to be more unoccupied space in the pocket compared to that of the naphthyl benzoxazoles. Therefore, we felt that the 7-position of the phenyl-benzoxazole scaffold would be ideal to explore with diverse functional groups to enhance the ER potency and selectivity. The docking calculations were used to assist in the selection of functional groups. In addition, we hypothesized that electron-rich and/or chemically hard groups (nitrogen (e.g., nitrile), oxygen (e.g., carbonyl), halogens lighter than iodine, and alkenes) would have a greater likelihood of differentiating between ERR Met421 and ER Ile373 given the electronegative and polarizable nature of the methionine sulfur atom. A detailed justification of this hypothesis, as well as the optimization of the related phenyl-benzofuran scaffold 7-position, is beyond the scope of this paper and will be elaborated elsewhere.26 The introduction of a methoxy group (91, Table 5) at the 7-position of the benzoxazole nucleus resulted in a small improvement of the selectivity (43-fold) without affecting the ER potency. However, the introduction of a bromo substituent (92) resulted in a marked increase in ER potency (IC50 ) 2 nM) and a significant improvement in ER selectivity (68-fold). The small fluorine group ortho to the A-ring hydroxyl (entry 93) did not alter the potency or selectivity of the 7-bromo analogue, whereas the bulkier trifluoromethoxy group (entry 94) noticeably decreased ligand binding. This finding is not surprising because this hydroxyl participates in key interactions with the Glu305 and Arg346 residues, which may have been adversely affected by the bulkier trifluoromethoxy group. Substitution at the meta position of phenol (F, CH3) resulted in a small increase in potency and about a 2-fold loss of selectivity

(entries 95 and 96). 7-Cyano analogues 97 and 99 exhibited similar potency and selectivity to that of 7-bromo analogues 92 and 95, whereas ortho-substituted fluoro analogue 98 maintained its selectivity but lost about 8-fold in ER potency (98 vs 93). Methyl bromide 100 showed similar selectivity to that of 92 but had a 20-fold reduction in potency, whereas acetonitrile 101 was weakly active in ER . The carbonyl class of substituents (103-106) proved to be much weaker for both ERs but displayed moderate to good levels of ER selectivity. Amide analogue 106 was about 100-fold selective for ER . The ethyl and propyl substituents (108 and 109) exhibited small decreases in potency and selectivity relative to 92, whereas the bulkier isopropyl and butyl groups (110, 111) had noticeably weaker binding affinity for ER . The ethynyl and allyl groups (112, 113) were similar to the ethyl and propyl groups with respect to potency and selectivity. However, the incorporation of a vinyl group (116) increased the selectivity to >100-fold in favor of ER . Introducing fluorine ortho to the hydroxyl group produced 117 (ERB041), which showed a somewhat greater selectivity (226fold). 2-Fluorovinyl analogue 118 was equipotent to 117 but 2-fold less selective, whereas the bulkier 2-bromovinyl and 2-methylvinyl analogues (119-122) were substantially less potent and selective for ER . It is likely that unfavorable steric interactions between these bulkier groups and Ile373 are responsible for the decreased ligand affinity. Some interesting findings were also observed with various fluorine analogues of 117. Fluoro and difluro analogues 123-125 were about 2-3× more potent and 2× less selective than 117, whereas difluoro analogues 126 and 127 were considerably less potent than 117. Considering that fluoro substituents do not significantly alter the size of the molecule, electrostatic repulsion involving one of the fluorine groups is the likely reason for the loss of potency. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis is the fact that 2,6-difluoro analogue 127, most likely to experience repulsion with the carboxylic acid of Glu305, was the least potent analogue among them. For 2,5-difluoro analogue 126, it is likely that the 5-fluoro analogue experiences somewhat weaker electrostatic repulsion with the carbonyl of Leu346. A methyl group meta to the A-ring hydroxyl group (128) caused a 9-fold decrease in ER potency and 2-fold reduction in selectivity. Various aromatic and carbocyclic groups (129-134) were found to be 50-100-fold less potent and selective than 116, most likely because of unfavorable steric interactions with the pocket. The introduction of a bromine group at the 4-postion of the benzoxazole nucleus of compounds 117 (7-vinyl) and 91 (7-methoxy) produced monobromo analogues 135 and 137, respectively, causing a reduction in potency. Dibromovinyl analogue 136 exhibited an additional loss of ER potency, although analogous methoxy analogue 138 maintained its ER potency. Both dibromo analogues were 5-10× less ER selective than the monobromo parent compounds. To confirm that functional groups at the 7-position were targeting the ERR Met421/ER Ile373 pocket, we cocrystallized compound 117 (ERB-041) with human ER (Figure 6).26 The binding mode of compound 117 is similar to what we predicted for parent compound

81, where the phenolic hydroxyl of 117 interacts with the Glu305-Arg346-water triad through a hydrogenbonding network, whereas the hydroxyl group of the benzoxazole nucleus extends to the distal end of the cavity making a hydrogen-bond interaction with His475. The 2-phenol and 7-vinyl groups exhibit dihedral angles of 23 and 38°, respectively, relative to the benzoxazole plane. The 7-vinyl group extends into the ERR Met421/ ER Ile373 pocket as intended and sits in a groove formed by Ile373, Ile376, and Phe377. The vinyl CH acts as a "hinge" that directs the ethylene moiety into this relatively narrow groove and forces it to be in close proximity to ERR Met421/ER Ile373. We hypothesize that the substitution of ER Ile373 with ERR Met421 within this groove would lead to a combination of electrostatic and steric repulsion associated with the methionine side chain, leading to enhanced ER selectivity.26 The crystallography studies also confirmed that helix 12 of ER maintains an agonist-like conformation when 117 is bound to the receptor, allowing for the binding of a nuclear receptor box coactivator peptide, consistent with the fact that 117 behaves as a full agonist on ER and ERR (see below).

Selected compounds were evaluated in rat and mouse ERR/ LBD binding assays as well as human full-length ERR/ binding assays. In both rat and mouse LBD binding assays, the majority of the tested compounds (Table 6) exhibited similar potency and selectivity relative to the human LBD assays, with the exception of compounds 73, 81, and 103 that were about 4-7× more potent in the mouse LBD assay. In the human fulllength binding assays, all tested compounds (Table 7) were similar to the LBD assays with respect to potency and selectivity, with the exception of compounds 97, 98, 113, and 117, which demonstrated somewhat higher selectivity relative to the human LBD assays for ER . Biological Evaluation. Cell-Based Transcriptional Activity. Two assays were used during the program to determine whether compounds were ER agonists. Both assays used the human osteosarcoma cell line, SAOS-2, and these cells were engineered to overexpress ER via adenovirus infection.

tested were essentially full agonists. (Representative examples from the IGFBP-4 assay are shown in Table 8.) In Vivo Evaluation. We had two goals during the in vivo evaluation of our compounds. The first was to assess selectivity and/or classic estrogenic activity, and the second was to evaluate efficacy in a model of inflammation. Rodent Uterotrophic Assays. The sexually immature rodent uterus is a classic estrogen target tissue and is used as a sensitive estrogenic bioassay. Nonselective estrogens, such as 17 -estradiol and 17R-ethynyl17 -estradiol, increase organ weight in both rats and mice approximately 4-fold, and an ERR-selective ligand (propylpyrazole triol (PPT)) is as efficacious as these reference estrogens.8 These data suggest that ERR activation is sufficient to elicit a full estrogenic response in the uterus (as measured by organ weight increase). For the rat assay, ER -selective compounds were administered for 3 days at a dose of 2 mg/rat/day, which is equivalent to 36-53 mg/kg when the typical growth of the animals is taken into account. For the mouse assay, ER -selective compounds were dosed for 4 days at 50 mg/kg (based on the initial weight of the mice). As shown in Tables 9 and 10, all ER -selective compounds tested were nonuterotrophic. Compounds 92, 93, 97, 117 (ERB-041), and 124 were not antagonistic when tested in combination with 17R-ethynyl-17 -estradiol. Taken together, these data show that these compounds are functionally selective for ER in vivo and do not impact ERR activity. The in vivo selectivity of these compounds is striking in that even at very high doses no activation of ERR is seen. This finding, likely, cannot be explained by binding selectivity alone. It is well recognized that the receptor-ligand interaction is but the first step in receptor activation, and it is possible that although the compounds interact weakly with ERR they do not elicit the conformational changes required for dimerization and coactivator recruitment. Rat Model of Osteopenia. After ovariectomy, rats lose bone mineral density (mass), which can be prevented by the administration of nonselective estrogens (e.g., 17 -estradiol), selective estrogen-receptor modulators (e.g., TSE-424),34 or an ERR-selective ligand (PPT).8 However, 92 and 93 had no effect on either total or trabecular bone mineral density (Table 11). Moreover, when 92 was combined with 17 -estradiol, no antagonistic effect was seen. Previously, we showed that 117 (ERB-041) was also inactive in this assay.7 These data are consistent with the results from the uterotrophic assay above, suggesting that the estrogenic response in this model is mediated via ERR and that these ER selective compounds do not impact ERR activity in vivo.

Vasomotor Instability. At menopause, many women experience debilitating vasomotor instability, and nonselective estrogens (e.g., 17 -estradiol and conjugated equine estrogens) are indicated for relief. One animal model of vasomotor instability, where clinically active compounds are also active, is the morphine-addicted ovariectomized rat. In this model, acute withdrawal of morphine (using an opioid receptor antagonist) induces a rise in tail skin temperature.37 Nonselective estrogens and an ERR-selective ligand (PPT) prevent this tail skin temperature increase in morphine-addicted rats upon acute withdrawal.8 As shown in Table 12, 92 and 97 failed to blunt this "flush", although other studies have shown that they do cross the blood-brain barrier (data not shown). Again, these data are consistent with the uterine and osteopenia model results, illustrating a role for ERR in these endpoints and the fact that ER selective ligands have no effect. Antiandrogenic Assay. Because ER is highly expressed in the rat prostate and there have been suggestions that ER may influence prostate proliferation,38 we sought to determine if ER -selective agonists were antiandrogenic. As shown in Table 13, 93 and 117 (ERB-041) did not decrease ventral prostate weight when given in combination with testosterone propionate, whereas the reference antiandrogen completely blocked the androgen-induced response.

Figure 7. Male HLA-B27 transgenic rats were treated with daily oral doses of the test compound, and stool character was assessed daily (1 ) normal; 3 ) diarrhea). From days 1-18, the dose was 10 mg/kg, and from days 19-46, it was 20 mg/ kg.

whereas the colon studies were initiated when the rats were symptomatic. These data show that this class of compounds, although being devoid of classic estrogenic activity, does possess anti-inflammatory activity in this model. Summary In this report, we have described the detailed exploration of diphenolic benzisoxazole/benzoxazole scaffolds that led to the discovery of highly potent and selective agonists for ER . The most potent and selective analogues of this series have binding affinities of 1-5 nM at ER and selectivities relative to ERR of >100-fold. X-ray cocrystal structures of structurally diverse ligands complexed with ER , in conjunction with docking calculations, were used to study a single, conservative residue substitution in the ligand-binding pocket, ERR Met421 f ER Ile373, to optimize ER selectivity. The majority of ER -selective agonists tested that are at least 50-fold selective display consistent in vivo profiles: they are inactive in several models of classic estrogen action and yet are active in a model of inflammation. These data suggest that this class of compounds may have utility in treating chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease while lacking the undesirable side effects of nonselective estrogen agonists. Experimental Section
Chemistry. Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes on a Mel-Temp-II apparatus and were reported uncorrected. 1H NMR spectra were determined in the cited solvent on a Varian Unity or Varian Inova (400-MHz) instrument with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Chemical shifts are given in ppm, and coupling constants are in hertz.

Figure 8. Male HLA-B27 transgenic rats were treated with daily oral doses of the test compound, and stool character was assessed daily (1 ) normal; 3 ) diarrhea). 123 was dosed at 10 mg/kg from days 1-14; the dose was then increased to 20 mg/kg. Other compounds were dosed at 10 mg/kg throughout the study.

suggest that in normal rats ER -selective agonists do not interfere with androgen-regulated prostatic growth responses. HLA-B27 Transgenic Rat. HLA-B27 transgenic rats are used as models of both inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis. Previously, we showed that 117 (ERB041) normalized stool character and improved colonic histology in this model.7 As shown in Figures 7 and 8, other ER -selective agonists also possess this activity. In addition to improving stool scores, most compounds also improved colonic histology scores (Table 14). Finally, 93, although modestly improving stool score but not colon histology, largely prevented arthropathy from developing in these rats (Figure 9). One possible explanation for the divergent activity on these two endpoints is that the arthropathy studies were prophylactic,

The infrared spectra were recorded on an AVATAR 360 Nicolet spectrophotometer as KBr pellets or as solutions in chloroform. Mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass LCT, Waters spectrometer. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240 analyzer, and all compounds are within (0.4% of theory unless otherwise indicated. All products, unless otherwise noted, were purified by "flash chromatography" using 220-400 mesh silica gel. Thin-layer chromatography was done on silica gel 60 F-254 (0.25-mm thickness) plates. Visualization was accomplished with UV light and/or 10% phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol. The hydration was determined by Karl Fischer titration using Mitsubishi moisture meter model CA-05. Unless otherwise noted, all materials were obtained commercially and used without further purification. All reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of dry argon or nitrogen. Representative synthetic protocols of the isoxazoles shown in Schemes 1-3 are described below. Both the phenylisoxazoles and naphthylisoxazoles were prepared in substantially the same manner from appropriately substituted starting material.

Malamas et al. SAOS-2 cells engineered with an adenovirus to express human ER . Briefly, cells were treated for 24 h with 1 µM test compound or 10 nM 17 -estradiol, and mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Rat Uterotrophic Assay. This assay was performed as previously described.8 Briefly, sexually immature rats (19 days old) were treated with the compound daily for 3 days and euthanized 24 h after the last dose. The vehicle was 50% DMSO/50% 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.2mL doses were administered subcutaneously. The doses given are expressed in milligrams or micrograms per rat per day because the rats typically grow from 38 to 55 g during the course of the study. Thus, the ER -selective compound dose of 2 mg/rat translates into 36-53 mg/kg, and the ethynyl estradiol dose of 0.06 µg/rat ranges from 1.1 to 1.6 µg/kg. Mouse Uterotrophic Assay. Sexually immature (18 d) wild type 129 Sv/Ev mice were either purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) or obtained from our in-house ER knockout-mouse breeding colony.35 Compounds were obtained from the Wyeth compound library, solubilized in 100% DMSO, and used in a vehicle of 5% DMSO/95% corn oil. Mice (six per group) were injected subcutaneously with 0.1 mL of solution for 4 days (aged 21-24 days) at a dose based on their weight at the start of the study. At necropsy, uteri were excised, trimmed of associated fat, drained of any internal fluid, and weighed. For all studies, the dose of 17 -estradiol was 50 mg/ kg, which is a supramaximal dose. Rat Vasomotor Instability Assay. This assay was performed as previously described.37 Antiandrogenic Assay. Immature male Sprague-Dawley rats, castrated by the vendor (Taconic Farms, NY) at 40-45 g body weight (22 days old) were shipped 2 days after surgery and were acclimated for 5 days prior to the beginning of study. The animals were maintained on a diet of standard lab chow and water. Beginning 7 days after castration, ERB-041 was administered once daily for 10 consecutive days at 20 mg/kg, subcutaneously in a volume of 0.2 mL per rat in a vehicle of 50% DMSO/50% 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with a concurrent dose (0.8 mg/kg) of the reference androgen testosterone propionate. Flutamide was orally administered at 10 mg/kg as a positive antiandrogen control. Approximately 24 h after the final dosing, animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. The ventral prostate was excised, cleaned of extraneous tissue, blotted on filter paper, and weighed. HLA-B27 Transgenic Rat. This model was performed as previously described,7 except that rats in the present study were 8-10 weeks of age at the start of the study. X-ray Crystallography: Expression of ER LBD. Human ER cDNA was generated from human-testis RNA by RTPCR and cloned into mammalian expression-vector pcDNA3. Amino acids 261-500 of the LBD were amplified from the cloned cDNA by PCR with the forward primer 5-GAACCATGGACGACGCCCTGAGCCCCGAGCAGCTAGTG-3 and the reverse primer 5-GGACTCGAGTTAGTCGTCAAGCACGTGGGCATTCAGCATCTC-3. The PCR fragment was inserted into E. coli expression-vector pET16b (Novagen) between the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. The primers used encode three extra asp codons, one before the codon for D261 and two after L500. The expressed LBD thus has the following sequence: MD[D261-L500]DD. ER LBD was overexpressed from a highdensity culture of E. coli BL21DE3 host cells (Stratagene) in a Biostat C-10 bioreactor (B. Braun Biotech). Cultures were induced with 1.0 mM IPTG final for 4 h at 37 °C. Cell pellets were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -80 °C. Purification of ER LBD. Harvested cells were lysed by two cycles of French press (SLM Instrument) at 20 000 psi in a buffer of 20 mM tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA (10 mL/g of cells). Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 45 000g for 45 min at 4 °C and then applied to a Q Sepharose (Pharmacia) column.

The column was then re-equilibrated with 50 mL of 10 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA (buffer B), and then the protein was carboxymethylated using 50 mL of buffer B containing 5 mM iodoacetic acid. The column was then washed with 500 mL of buffer A, followed by elution in buffer A containing 200 µM ligand. Finally, the eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration and size-exclusion chromatography (Sephadex 200, Pharmacia) using the elution buffer containing 5 µM ligand. The purity was estimated to be g98% by SDSPAGE. The excess amount of ligand was removed by passing the solution through a G-25 column (Pharmacia). Docking Calculations. Docking calculations were performed using the QXP software package.36 The QXP Monte Carlo docking algorithm mcdock was used to generate potential binding modes in the active site. In general, 1000 Monte Carlo steps was sufficient for the poses and their energy scores to converge. Constrained-residue flexibility was utilized to take subtle movements of the pocket into account when necessary. Visualization of X-ray structures and docking results was performed using the InsightII and Quanta software package (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA).
