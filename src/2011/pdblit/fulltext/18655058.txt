ABSTRACT We determine and compare the crystal structure of two proteases belonging to the subtilisin superfamily: S41, a cold-adapted serine protease produced by Ant° arctic bacilli, at 1.4 A resolution and Sph, a mesophilic serine protease produced by Bacillus sphaericus, at 0.8 ° A resolution. The purpose of this comparison was to find out whether multiple calcium ion binding is a molecular factor responsible for the adaptation of S41 to extreme low temperatures. We find that these two subtilisins have the same subtilisin fold with a root ° mean square between the two structures of 0.54 A. The final models for S41 and Sph include a calciumloaded state of five ions bound to each of these two subtilisin molecules. None of these calcium-binding sites correlate with the high affinity known binding site (site A) found for other subtilisins. Structural analysis of the five calcium-binding sites found in these two crystal structures indicate that three of the binding sites have two side chains of an acidic residue coordinating the calcium ion, whereas the other two binding sites have either a main-chain carbonyl, or only one acidic residue side chain coordinating the calcium ion. Thus, we conclude that three of the sites are of high affinity toward calcium ions, whereas the other two are of low affinity. Because Sph is a mesophilic subtilisin and S41 is a psychrophilic subtilisin, but both crystal structures were found to bind five calcium ions, we suggest that multiple calcium ion binding is not responsible for the adaptation of S41 to low temperatures.

INTRODUCTION In the present study, we determined and compared the crystal structures of S41, a psychrophilic (cold-adapted) subtilisin from ° Antarctic Bacillus TA411,2 at 1.4 A resolution, and Sph, a meso° philic subtilisin from Bacillus sphaericus 22973,4 at 0.8 A resolution, for the purpose of understanding whether multiple calcium ion binding is a molecular factor responsible for the adaptation of S41 to extreme low temperatures.5,6 Subtilisin S41 has high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures and relative instability at high temperatures7,8 and shares a high amino acid sequence similarity with other subtilisins from psychrophilic (S39),9 mesophilic (BPN0 ),10 and thermophilic (thermitase)11,12 organisms. Attempts to identify the molecular factors responsible for the adaptation of subtilisins to low temperatures have been based mainly on sequence comparisons.1,2,13­21 Structural analysis of psychrophilic proteins is somewhat limited, because only a few crystal structures of psychrophilic proteins have been determined. It has been suggested, based on amino acid sequence analysis, that the S41 surface is rich in hydrophilic residues, particularly Asp, which may contribute to its adaptation to psychrophilic conditions.7,22­24 In addition, S41 amino acid sequence analysis revealed several extended surface loops that are generally not found in subtilisins and are considered responsible for its adaptation to low temperatures.23 We previously determined the crystal structure of Sph at 0.93 ° A resolution by the Eu/MAD method.3,4 The final model included all 310 amino acids, 1 disulfide bond, 679 water molecules, and 5 calcium ions. Several other members of the subtilisin superfamily are known to bind calcium ions. Subtilisin BPN0

(pdb entry 1sup), for example, has been found to have two calcium-binding sites, termed sites A and B. Site A is of high affinity toward calcium ion, whereas site B is of lower affinity toward calcium ion and in several crystal structures this site is either occupied with potassium ion or unoccupied. The calcium ion in site A is coordinated by the N-terminal (residue 2) and by a surface loop composed of residues 76­84. Calcium ion in this site is found in many crystal structures of the subtilisin superfamily and has been predicted to be found in other subtilisins whose structure has not yet been determined because of the high similarity in the amino acid sequence in this loop region between the subtilisins from different organisms. Thermitase (pdb entry 1thm), for example, is a thermophilic subtilisin, which was found to have three calcium binding sites. The calcium-binding sites include, in addition to calcium ion at A and B sites, a third calcium ion binding site. Recently, the crystal of subtilisinlike serine protease from the psychrophilic Vibrio species was determined (pdb entry 1sh7) and was also found to have three calcium-binding sites.25 The results of this study reveal that the crystal structures of the psychrophilic subtilisin S41 and the mesophilic subtilisin Sph are nearly identical with the same calcium-loaded state in that five calcium ions were found to be bound to each protein molecule. This finding suggests that multiple calcium ion binding is not one of the molecular factors responsible for temperature adaptation of S41. MATERIALS AND METHODS

High resolution data collection for S41 and Sph crystals

Crystallization experiments of S41 were set up using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method with VDX-24 tissue culture plates (Hampton HB3-140) at 48C. Droplets of the protein solution containing 8 mg/mL protein in 10 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 2M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM PMSF, and 0.8% ethanol were mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 0.1M HEPES, pH 7.0­7.4, and 20­33% PEG 8000. One to several single crystals appeared in each droplet within 7­10 days and grew to about 0.15 3 0.15 3 0.25 mm3 after about 2 weeks. Crystals were looped out of the drop they were grown in and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction studies on these crystals indicated that they belong to either the tetragonal space group P41212 or P43212. Unit cell dimen° ° sions were a 5 b 5 61.00 A and c 5 174.77 A, indicating one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Crystallization experiments of Sph were carried out as described earlier using the hanging drop method.3 Although all the crystals in the same droplet had the same morphology as the previously reported crystals, the new crystal form was larger, exhibited different crystallographic parameters, and showed X-ray diffraction to different extents. The unit cell parameters for the new crys-

X-ray diffraction data were collected for S41 in a single pass at 100 K at APS beamline 17-ID (IMCA-CAT) on a Siemens 2K 3 2K CCD detector positioned at 200 mm ° from the crystal (wavelength 1.0 A). The data consisted of 350 electronic images comprising 0.38 oscillation each (an exposure time of 1 s/oscillation was used). Unit cell parameters, crystal orientation, and the integration of reflection intensities were performed with SAINT.26 The ° data set for S41 in the last shell between 1.46 A and 1.40 ° was only 66.2% complete. The summary of the data A processing statistics for S41 is shown in Table I. X-ray diffraction data were collected for Sph in three passes at 100 K. The crystal was looped out of the drop it was grown in and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data of native Sph crystals were collected at EMBL Hamburg Outstation beamline BW7B on a MAR345 image plate positioned at 200 mm, 120 mm, and 85 mm from the ° crystal (wavelength 0.8423 A). For the first pass in which the image plate was positioned at 200 mm, 182 frames, each of 0.58, were collected; for the second pass in which the image plate was positioned at 120 mm, 160 frames, each of 18, were collected; and for the third pass in which the image plate was positioned at 85 mm, 110 frames of 1.58, were collected. The three data sets consisted of 450 electronic images. Unit cell parameters, crystal orientation determination, and the integration of reflection intensities were performed with the MOSFLM27 program system. Diffraction studies of the new Sph crystals indicate that they belong to the monoclinic space group P21 like the previously reported crystals, but have a different unit cell, different asymmetric unit, and diffracted X-ray to higher reso° lution (0.8 A). A summary of the data processing statistics for Sph is shown in Table I.
Structure solutions and refinement

The structure of S41 was determined using the molecular replacement method with the AMoRe program package.28 The structure of the bacterial subtilisin BPN0 (PDB entry 1yja) was used as the starting model to search both the P41212 and P43212 space groups. The correlation coefficient and the crystallographic R-factor for this initial model in these two space groups were 0.270 and 0.527 (P41212) and 0.141 and 0.546 (P43212), respectively. The angles (a, b, and g) and translation shifts (tx, ty, and tz) for P41212 were 73.358, 60.718, and 151.588, and 20.0964, 0.4497, and 0.2704 for the data to ° 3.0 A. After rigid body refinement, the correlation coefficient and the crystallographic R-factor were 0.386 and

Refinement was carried out for the P41212 solution with REFMAC using the conjugate direction method29,30 and the maximum likelihood residual, and applying the standard Engh and Huber geometrical restraints.31 A bulk solvent correction was also applied. The correct amino acids for S41 were built into the resulting electron density by hand, using the interactive graphics program Quanta (Accelrys). Where possible, the amino acids from the search model (pdb entry 1yja) were replaced with those corresponding to S41. Stretches of insertions and deletions in the amino acid sequence were built de novo in Quanta. After several cycles of iterative refinement and fitting/refitting, automatic water assignment and removal were done with ARP.32 This procedure was repeated until the overall Rfactor and free R-factor33 converged at 0.160 and 0.198, respectively.

The angles (a, b, and g) and translation shifts (tx, ty, and tz) for the two molecules (A and B) of Sph in the asymmetric unit were 180.048, 65.618, 180.048, 0.257, 0.000, and 0.145 for molecule A, and 180.048, 65.618, 180.048, 0.007, 0.000, and 0.395 for molecule B. The correlation coefficient and the crystallographic R-factor for this model were 0.81 and 47%, respectively. Refinement was carried out with REFMAC5 using the conjugate direction method29,30 and the maximum likelihood residual and applying the standard Engh and Huber geometrical restraints.31 A bulk solvent correction was also applied, and anisotropic temperature factors were refined for all the atoms. After several cycles of refinement, automatic water assignment and removal were done with ARP.32 This procedure was repeated until the overall R-factor and free R-factor33 converged. The weighted difference electron density maps were examined and the occupancies of alternative conformations adjusted. The model was also refined independently against the amplitudes using SHELXL (pdb entry 3d43), but the results were not better when using REFMAC. The main difference in the fit of the two models can be attributed to the lower number of solvent atoms located using the SHELXL refinement. The average difference in position, for all the

The final model of Sph (pdb entry 2ixt) consisted of two Sph molecules related by a rotation axis 1.2 degrees away from the crystallographic unique axis. The average coordinate displacement between the two molecules was ° ° 0.285 A (rms is 0.587 A). The C-terminal residue (Gln310) was disordered in the A molecule and could not be traced in the electron density map. Both molecules of Sph were found to bind five calcium ions. The final crystallographic R factor was 13.82% for the data between ° ° 84.5 A and 0.80 A resolution (R free was 15.38% for 5.0% ° of the data). Compared to the 0.93 A model of Sph, there was further improvement in the details of the electron density map. The Ramachandran plot showed that 90.9% of the residues lie in the most favored regions and 8.9% in the additional allowed regions.34 The final refinement parameters for S41 and Sph are given in Table I. The superpositioning of the crystal structures of S41and Sph including the calcium ions is shown in Figure 1.

RESULTS
The final model of S41 and of Sph

A comparison of the Sph active site with the S41 active site showed that all the catalytic residues are superimpos° able with differences of less than 0.05 A for the Cas (see Fig. 2). The active site of S41 includes one molecule of the inhibitor PMSF, and its binding to the active site of S41 caused a rotation of the active site residue His (see Fig. 2). Similar results were observed for His64 of subtilisin BPN0 ,35,36 which was observed in two conformations: one similar to that seen in the Sph crystal structure and the other identical to that in the crystal structure of S41. These two conformations result from a rotation around Ca­Cb of the His residue, caused by binding of the PMSF molecule. During the final stages of refinement of the Sph crystal structure, we observed an additional electron density in

We found that the overall structure and fold of S41 and Sph are similar to the other members of the subtilisin superfamily. Most of the subtilisin family members have less than 280 residues, whereas S41 has 309 residues and Sph 310 residues. The extra residues in the sequence resulted primarily in additional loops or longer surface loops. The final model of S41 consisted of 2204 protein atoms, 536 water molecules, and 15 hetero-atoms including five calcium ions for each S41 molecule and one molecule of the inhibitor phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride (PMSF). The final crystallographic R-factor was 16.03% ° ° for the data between 57.7 A and 1.4 A resolution (R free was 19.77% for 5.0% of the data). The final model was evaluated with the program package PROCHECK.34 The Ramachandran plot showed that 89.1% of the residues lie in the most favored regions and 10.1% in the additional allowed regions.

° the active site located 1.55 A from the Og of Ser250 with a tetrahedral shape. This electron density was interpreted in one of our previous studies as a sulfonyl ion (SO32) that is probably hydrolyzed from the buffer in which crystallization was carried out (HEPES buffer).3 The distances between the sulfur and the four oxygen atoms ° were 1.5 A, and the angles were about 1008, as would be expected for a sulfonyl. Because crystallization was carried out at 5­25 mM CaCl2, 0.1M HEPES, pH 7.5, and 24% PEG 6000, sulfonyl ion (SO32) was the only possible ion to be fitted. We refined the occupancy of the sulfonyl ion with a partial occupancy of 0.5, which resulted in a high B factor for the sulfur ion relative to the B factors of the surrounding oxygen atoms or to the average B factor of all the atoms in the structure. It should be noted that the sulfonyl binding did not result in rotation of the active site His residue upon binding. In the cur° rent model, at 0.8 A resolution, the same density appeared for both Sph molecules in the asymmetric unit. However, the density assigned to the sulfur atom was not higher than that corresponding to the oxygen atoms bound to it. This is clear in the higher resolution density map and casts doubt on its initial assignment by us as a sulfonyl ion. Efforts to fit PMSF, HEPES, or a peptide similar to the tetra-peptide bound to subtilisin BPN0 35 into this electron density were unsuccessful. Furthermore, because, in a recent study, borate ion, which is a serine protease inhibitor, was found to bind to the active site serine37 of proteinase K, we tried to fit borate into the electron density of Sph. Our results showed that borate ion refines satisfactory into this electron density. But, because Sph was purified and crystallized in the absence of any inhibitors (such as PMSF or a borate ion), the extra density was not assigned in the final model. The geometry and hydrogen-bonding distances between the catalytic triad residues (in Sph Ser250, His74, and Asp34) have been studied intensively using different techniques such as NMR,38­40 neutron diffraction,41 and Xray crystallography.42,43 Previous biochemical work on the general mechanism of serine proteases suggested that in the transition state His and Asp residues form especially strong hydrogen bonds called low barrier hydrogen ° bonds.44­46 In the current structure of Sph at 0.8 A resolution, the bond distances between the catalytic triad of ° Sph were 2.87 A for the His71Ne2-Ser250Og bond and ° for the His71Nd1-Asp34Od1 bond. Nd1 and Ne2 2.61 A of His71 could be clearly distinguished from the carbon atoms Cd2 and Ce1 in the electron density map. The same short hydrogen bond was found in the previously ° reported structure of Sph at 0.93 A and in the crystal ° structure of Bacillus lentus subtilisin at 0.78 A.43
The calcium-binding mode of S41 and Sph

the subtilisin superfamily have indicated that bacterial subtilisins have two Ca-binding sites, which are located far from the active site.35,36,47 Recently, several additional calcium-binding sites were reported for other members of the subtilisin superfamily.11,12,48,49 For example, six calcium-binding sites were reported for the hyperthermophilic archaeon Tk with its propeptide.50 All these sites are located far from the active site and do not necessarily correlate with site A. Based on these studies, it has been suggested that calcium ions are important for correct folding of subtilisin and that the role of calcium ions can vary between members of the subtilisin family. The calcium-binding sites typically consist of six ligands that are geometrically arranged as an octahedron that is more or less distorted.51 The ligands for calcium ion can be either charged residues (e.g., the side chains of Asp and Glu residues), polarized oxygens (such as backbone carbonyls), or water molecules. Five identical calcium-binding sites (Ca-1­Ca-5) were found in both Sph and S41 (Table II). These calcium ions are on the surface of the molecules and are coordinated by surface loops. The Ca-1, Ca-2, and Ca-3 calcium-binding sites are high affinity sites (which we named type 1), and Ca-4, Ca-5 are low affinity sites (which we named type 2), as based on the number and type of calcium-binding

and Asp298; Sph numbering). A similar calcium-binding mode was found for Ca-2 that includes two aspartate side chains (Asp217; Asp224; Sph numbering) and one water molecule. The Ca-3 site is on the surface of the protein molecule and is composed of two acidic side chains Asp and Glu (Asp 98, Glu 49; Sph numbering). In addition to the acidic side chains, there are three other ligands in this calcium-binding site, which are water molecules. Ca-4 and Ca-5 sites are of lower affinity toward calcium ions and belong to the type 2 sites. The type 2 sites consist of one acidic residue or the main-chain carbonyl groups, and several water molecules. The Ca-4 site consists of one acidic residue (Asp115; Sph numbering) and four water molecules. The calcium-binding site 5 (Ca-5) most probably has the lowest affinity and is composed of three carbonyls (Gly181, Leu183, Ala186; Sph numbering) and two water molecules. This site coincides with the known low-affinity B-site found in other subtilisins. Figure 3 compares the calcium-binding sites of several subtilisins: Sph, S41, subtilisin BPN0 , psychrophilic subtilisin-like protease from Vibrio and thermitase. The B site is conserved for all these subtilisins, while the A site is found only for subtilisin BPN0 and thermitase. DISCUSSION ° We determined the crystal structures of S41 at 1.4 A ° resolution. Both crystal resolution and Sph at 0.80 A structures were found to have the same subtilisin fold with several surface-extended loops. The superposition of the two atomic models revealed that the two molecules are almost identical although they were determined using

ligands. At type 1 sites, the calcium ion has two acidic residues and one to three water molecules. The Ca-1 and Ca-2 sites are most probably high affinity sites and belong to the type 1 sites. The Ca-1 site consists of a surface loop composed of residues 287­299 (Sph numbering) and one water molecule. The protein side chain ligands in this site are two aspartate side chains (Asp287

different starting models. The RMS deviation between ° the two crystal structures is 0.54 A (for 307 Ca atoms). Even more remarkable is that both Sph and S41 bind five ° calcium ions with an RMS of 0.50 A between the calcium ions (see Fig. 3). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of S41, Sph, and subtilisin BPN0 indicated the high content of the acidic residues of S41 and Sph compared to subtilisin BPN0 . For example, subtilisin BPN0 contains 9 Asp residues and 4 Glu residues, Sph contains 19 Asp residues and 6 Glu residues, and S41 contains 21 Asp residues and 7 Glu residues. The acidic residues of Sph and S41 were found mainly on the surface loops (see Fig. 4). The surface charge that results from the acidic residues on the surface loops is probably the main reason for the calcium-loaded state of these two enzymes. The extended charged loops and the unique calcium-binding mode, may play a role in maintaining the proper folding of the enzymes. A previous comparison of the thermophilc subtilisin thermitase (pdb entry 1thm), mesophilic subtilisin proteinase K (pdb entry 1ic6), and the cold-adapted subtilisinlike protease (pdb entry 1sh7) revealed that the coldadapted subtilisin has the largest exposed area, the highest content of negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu), and the smallest ratio between the negatively charged residues and the positively charged residues (Asp and Glu/Arg and Lys).25 We compared these molecular factors that are known to contribute to temperature adaptation of subtilisins using the crystal structures of Sph and S41. We found that when compared with Sph, S41 has a larger exposed ° ° area (11028 A2 vs. 11098 A2), a higher content of negatively charged residues, (28 for S41 vs. 25 for Sph) and a smaller ratio between the negatively charged residues and the positively charge residues (0.60 for S41 and 0.65 for Sph). However, despite these differences, our results reveal that their calcium-binding mode is identical. The presence of five calcium ions bound to a subtilisin has not been reported for other members of the subtilisin superfamily. The fact that we found the same calcium-binding mode in the present work for S41, which is a cold-adapted subtilisin, suggests that calcium ions are not responsible for its adaptation to low temperature but rather act as counter ions for anionic residues found on its surface. The role of multiple calcium ion binding is most probably to reduce the flexibility of the polypeptide chain and to inhibit local unfolding and autolysis rather than to be involved in temperature adaptation.

protease with the crystal structures of S41 and Sph indicated that four of the five calcium-binding sites found for S41 and Sph are new, and the fifth site (B site) is identical for all these subtilisins. From the high structural similarity between Sph and S41 and their identical calcium-binding mode, we can conclude that the calcium-loaded state is not responsible for the cold adaptation of S41.
