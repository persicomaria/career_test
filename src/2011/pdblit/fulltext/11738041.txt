ithium has been in wide use for the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) for decades, based on the pioneering work of John Cade and Mogens Schou (Goodwin and Jamison 1990). However, despite a vast literature on the possible mechanisms of action, the direct target(s) of lithium in BD remains unknown. Identifying the direct target is a critical goal, as it should lead to the development of newer and safer therapies and is likely to give insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this common affective disorder. Although lithium is a simple ion and appears to function by displacing magnesium ion, lithium has a surprisingly limited number of known targets. These include a family of phosphomonoesterases (York et al 1995), of which inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) is the most highly studied with respect to lithium action; phosphoglucomutase (Gurvich and Klein 2002); and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (Klein and Melton 1996). Although all of these remain plausible direct targets that could explain the efficacy of lithium in BD, two intriguing articles in this issue address modulation of GSK-3 in affective disorders and therefore this brief commentary will focus on GSK-3. GSK-3 was first identified as a protein kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase (Doble and Woodgett 2003). GSK-3 proteins are encoded by two closely related genes, Gsk-3 and Gsk-3 . These isoforms have mostly similar properties and substrate specificity. GSK-3 often (but not always) functions as an inhibitor. Thus, insulin signaling activates glycogen synthesis in part by inhibiting GSK-3 and alleviating its inhibition of glycogen synthase. GSK-3 also antagonizes other signaling pathways, notably Wnt signaling. In this setting, GSK-3 phosphorylates -catenin, targeting it for rapid degradation. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3, stabilizing -catenin, which then functions as a transcription activator (Doble and Woodgett 2003; Gurvich and Klein 2002). At least two major physiologic mechanisms account for the inhibition of GSK-3 activity in cells: N-terminal phosphorylation, as seen with insulin and other signaling pathways, and an uncharacterized mechanism associated with Wnt signaling that is independent of N-terminal phosphorylation (McManus et al 2005). Insulin activates phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), which in turn leads to activation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. Akt is one of several protein kinases that phosphorylates GSK-3 at an N-terminal serine (serine-21 in GSK-3 and serine-9 in GSK-3 ), and this phosphorylation inhibits activity by creating a pseudosubstrate inhibitor. Other pathways that activate PI3K, including neutrotrophins and neurotransmitter agonists such as serotonergic ligands, can similarly induce inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3 (Li et al 2004). Other protein kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase, and p90rsk, have also been

implicated in the N-terminal phosphorylation of GSK-3 (Doble and Woodgett 2003; Gurvich and Klein 2002). Wnts inhibit GSK-3 when it is bound to the axin/adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) scaffold, but the mechanism of this inhibition has not been defined. Dysregulation of this process, for example through mutations in axin, APC, or the GSK-3 phosphorylation sites in -catenin, leads to malignant transformation, as seen in familial and sporadic colon cancers (Morin et al 1997). Wnt regulation of GSK-3 also affects downstream targets that are independent of Wnt/ -catenin signaling, including the tuberous sclerosis complex in mammals (Inoki et al 2006) and the polarity of mitotic spindles in C. elegans (Schlesinger et al 1999). Thus GSK-3 regulates, and is regulated by, a diverse array of distinct signaling pathways. GSK-3 was first proposed to be a direct target of lithium based on observed parallels between the effects of lithium and the effect of GSK-3 loss of function on the development of diverse model organisms, from the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum to the vertebrates such as Xenopus laevis, and also parallels between the effects of lithium and insulin on glycogen synthase activity in mammals (Klein and Melton 1996). These intriguing parallels suggested that lithium might act in these organisms by directly inhibiting GSK-3; indeed, lithium salts directly inhibit GSK-3 from vertebrate and invertebrate organisms (Hedgepeth et al 1997; Klein and Melton 1996) and were subsequently shown to inhibit GSK-3 as effectively as GSK-3 (Stambolic et al 1996). Pharmacological and genetic data now strongly support that inhibition of GSK-3 explains the effect of lithium on developing organisms and the well-documented activation of Wnt signaling by lithium. However, these observations do not answer whether GSK-3 is also the relevant target in BD, an issue that remains open and critically important for the study of this disorder. One approach to begin to address this question is to examine the targets of lithium in behavior models in animals. While it is clearly challenging to model mood disorders in animals, one can examine behaviors that are sensitive to mood-altering medications, including lithium and antidepressants. Chronic lithium attenuates hyperactivity induced by amphetamine and low-dose chlordiazepoxide (Murphy 1977) and also reduces immobility in the forced swim test (FST) (O'Brien et al 2004). Heterozygous loss of function for Gsk-3 in mice causes similar attenuation of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity (Beaulieu et al 2004) and reduced time immobile in the FST (O'Brien et al 2004), and these behavioral effects are mimicked by alternative GSK-3 inhibitors (Gould et al 2004; Kaidanovich-Beilin et al 2004). These correlations are consistent with a role for GSK-3 in mediating the behavioral response to lithium, although this has not yet been proven. Whether GSK-3 activity is altered in human patients with affective disorders, treated or not, has also not yet been established. Two articles in this issue of Biological Psychiatry provide intriguing data addressing changes in GSK3 in affective disorders (Karege et al, pages 240-245; Li et al, pages 216-222). Karege et al examine Akt and GSK-3 protein and activity in postmortem brain samples (ventral prefrontal cortex [VPFC]) from patients with or without documented major depressive disorder (MDD) BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2007;61:139 ­141 © 2007 Society of Biological Psychiatry

who have committed suicide versus those who died from other causes. While protein levels were similar among the groups, the enzymatic activities of Akt and GSK-3 were altered. The activity of Akt was decreased and GSK3 activity was concomitantly increased in the MDD patients. Surprisingly, overall GSK-3 activity was not different, implying that GSK-3 activity was not affected, although this was not measured directly. Furthermore, these differences in enzyme activities were associated with documented MDD and not linked to suicide per se. Although the sample size was small (10 patients per group), the patient groups were well matched and the authors made a thorough effort to exclude patients who may have received psychotropic medications or other drugs that might alter GSK-3 activity. This study is consistent with previous studies on postmortem brains of mood disorder subjects, which showed no difference in GSK-3 protein levels or overall activity in patients with BD or MDD compared with control subjects (Beasley et al 2002; Kozlovsky et al 2001; Lesort et al 1999). In addition, decreased Akt activity without any change in protein levels has been reported in the occipital cortex of depressed suicide victims (Hsiung et al 2003). The decrease in Akt activity correlated with upstream attenuation of serotonin (5-HT) signaling of suicide victims. The authors speculate that the cause for the decreased Akt and increased GSK3 activities seen in MDD may be due to alteration in serotonin receptor function. These data raise interesting issues concerning GSK-3 and affective disorders. Lithium controls mania and stabilizes mood in BD patients but is not generally thought of as an antidepressant. An increase in GSK-3 activity in MDD patients, if confirmed in larger studies, would therefore imply an unexpected role for GSK-3 in depression, although whether this is cause or effect in MDD would still be an open question. Although lithium, alternative GSK-3 inhibitors, and Gsk-3 haploinsufficiency all affect the FST in a manner similar to antidepressants, which would be consistent with the authors' findings, reduced immobility in the FST is not equivalent to depression in a human patient, and one should be cautious in extrapolating from these animal studies that lithium is an antidepressant for mice. Nevertheless, these are intriguing parallels. An especially interesting observation in this work is that they identified a group of suicide victims without documented MDD and whose Akt and GSK-3 activity was similar to control patients. Did these subjects commit suicide for some reason other than depression or could this group represent new onset, acute depression culminating in suicide before the patients came to medical attention? In this case, the biochemical findings in Karege et al could represent a difference between acute and chronic depression, with reduced Akt and increased GSK-3 activity perhaps representing an adaptation to chronic MDD. Another curious observation in their work is that although Akt activity was reduced, total GSK-3 activity was not increased. Akt inhibits both GSK-3 isoforms, yet only GSK-3 activity appears to have been increased in these MDD patients. (The lack of effect on is implied by the lack of change in total GSK-3 activity). If this distinction holds up in a larger series of patients, it may imply specific inhibition of GSK-3 by an alternative pathway. The authors did not report changes in GSK-3 phosphorylation, leaving open the possibility that another regulatory mechanism is involved here. Furthermore, GSK-3 is dephosphorylated in postmortem mouse brain within minutes (Li et al 2005); if similar dephosphorylation occurs in humans, postmortem samples harvested more than 26 hours after death would not be expected to maintain N-terminal phosphorylation regardless of psychiatric condition.

W.T. O'Brien and P.S. Klein support of this concern, Ide et al (2006) found that the level of GSK-3/serine-9 phosphorylation in human brain inversely correlates with postmortem interval. This might obscure changes due to N-terminal phosphorylation but other mechanisms of regulation could be stable to postmortem conditions. To get around the potentially confounding influence of dephosphorylation of GSK-3 in postmortem brain, Li et al examined phosphorylation of GSK-3 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Increased phosphorylation of GSK-3 by exposure to lithium has been observed by several groups, but the Jope group was the first to recognize this as a potential mechanism for amplifying the in vivo response to lithium (De Sarno et al 2002). Thus, lithium is a direct inhibitor of GSK-3 with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1 mmol/L (at physiological magnesium concentration); by itself this might not be sufficient inhibition to accomplish a therapeutic effect. However, this direct inhibition leads to a secondary, indirect inhibition mediated by increased N-terminal phosphorylation. Recent work showed that the target of lithium in this setting is also GSK-3, as alternative GSK-3 inhibitors as well as Gsk-3 loss of function also cause increased N-terminal phosphorylation (Zhang et al 2003), demonstrating an autoregulatory loop for GSK-3 in which GSK-3 regulates its own phosphorylation state through activation of an N-terminal phosphatase. Regardless of mechanism, this regulatory loop allows in vivo amplification of the response to lithium (De Sarno et al 2002). In this article, Li et al demonstrate that PBMCs respond to agents known to alter GSK-3 phosphorylation in cultured cells. Treatment of cultured PBMCs with a PKC activator or with protein phosphatase inhibitors results in increased N-terminal phosphorylation of GSK-3 . They then compared basal levels of serine-9 phosphorylation in PBMCs from healthy subjects with BD patients treated with lithium and with BD patients treated with various other psychotropic drugs but not with lithium. Remarkably, GSK-3 serine-9 phosphorylation was elevated in bipolar patients treated with lithium when compared with untreated, normal control subjects. The likeliest explanation is that lithium caused this increased N-terminal phosphorylation. However, the values for the lithium-free BD patients were intermediate between non-BD subjects and lithium-treated BD subjects and therefore it is formally possible that the elevated serine-9 phosphorylation is due to BD itself rather than lithium therapy. A more likely explanation, it would seem, is that the modestly increased N-terminal phosphorylation in the lithium-free BD group is due to one of the other medications these patient were taking, as several of these medications are known to increase serine-9 phosphorylation in animal models and in culture (De Sarno et al 2002; Li et al 2004). Thus, when larger numbers are included in future studies, this will hopefully include BD patients off all psychotropic medications (e.g., new diagnoses or noncompliant BD patients). An additional potentially interesting observation in this work is that PBMCs from BD patients (whether lithium treated or not) appeared to show increased sensitivity to lithium. It is not clear from the article, however, whether the differences between groups were statistically significant (differences within each group were significant), and the authors did not draw attention to this point. If the results of Li et al are confirmed in a larger group of patients and with a control group for BD patients off all lithium and other psychotropic medications, this would represent a very important advance for the field, as it would provide an assay to monitor biochemical efficacy of lithium in vivo. This would be invaluable as an in vivo assay for GSK-3 inhibition in humans and

W.T. O'Brien and P.S. Klein might allow correlation of GSK-3 activity with clinical efficacy of lithium. As other GSK-3 inhibitors also cause increased Nterminal phosphorylation (Zhang et al 2003), this might also serve as an in vivo assay for novel GSK-3 inhibitors when they are tested in humans. These two articles present novel findings in human samples. While both should be considered preliminary given the small number of patients studied, they provide a valuable platform for further investigation of GSK-3 in affective disorders within the clinical context.
