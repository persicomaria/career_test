Regeneration-induced CNPase homolog (RICH) is an axonal growthassociated protein, which is induced in teleost fish upon optical nerve injury. RICH consists of a highly acidic N-terminal domain, a catalytic domain with 2¢,3¢-cyclic nucleotide 3¢-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) activity and a C-terminal isoprenylation site. In vitro RICH and mammalian brain CNPase specifically catalyze the hydrolysis of 2¢,3¢-cyclic nucleotides to produce 2¢-nucleotides, but the physiologically relevant in vivo substrate remains unknown. Here, we report the NMR structure of the catalytic domain of goldfish RICH and describe its binding to CNPase inhibitors. The structure consists of a twisted nine-stranded antiparallel b-sheet surrounded by a-helices on both sides. Despite significant local differences mostly arising from a seven-residue insert in the RICH sequence, the active site region is highly similar to that of human CNPase. Likewise, refinement of the catalytic domain of rat CNPase using residual dipolar couplings gave improved agreement with the published crystal structure. NMR titrations of RICH with inhibitors point to a similar catalytic mechanism for RICH and CNPase. The results suggest a functional importance for the evolutionarily conserved phosphodiesterase activity and hint of a link with pre-tRNA splicing.

Axonal injuries in the mammalian central nervous system do not cause any significant regeneration response due to inhibitory signaling suppressing axon outgrowth and low trophic response [1­5]. In contrast, the axons of teleost fish regenerate upon nerve injury and have been used as a model system to study nerve regeneration in the central nervous system [6]. A better understanding of molecular processes leading to axonal regeneration in teleost fish could find important applications for treatment of human central nervous system injuries. Previous studies have identified numerous axonal growth-associated proteins, which are induced during nerve regeneration in teleost fish [6­9]. Regenerationinduced CNPase homologs (RICH) proteins are axonal

growth-associated proteins that were originally discovered in the studies of regenerating optical nerve in goldfish and were termed p68 / 70 based on their apparent molecular weight [10]. RICH proteins are induced in the retinal ganglion cells during axonal regrowth upon the optic nerve crush, and also expressed in the germinal neuroepithelium of retina, which generates new neurons throughout the lifespan of the fish [11]. The cloning of the RICH proteins from goldfish (gRICH68 and gRICH70) and zebrafish (zRICH) revealed significant homology with mammalian brain 2¢,3¢-cyclic nucleotide 3¢-phosphodiesterases (CNPases) [12­14]. CNPases hydrolyze 2¢,3¢-cyclic nucleotides in vitro and are abundant in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells [15]. Recent studies on CNPase-null

mutant mice revealed that the absence of CNPase causes axonal swelling and neuronal degeneration pointing to a role for CNPase in the maintenance of the myelin­axonal interface [16]. While the enzymatic activity of CNPase has been well characterized, its physiological substrate remains a mystery [17]. Structurally, RICH protein consists of three regions: a glutamate- and aspartate-rich N-terminal domain, a catalytic phosphodiesterase domain, and a C-terminal isoprenylation site (Fig. 1). Recent studies showed that the catalytic domain is fully sufficient for the in vitro activity of RICH [18], as previously shown for mammalian CNPase [19,20]. The catalytic domains of RICH and CNPase share a pair of conserved sequence motifs H-X-(T / S)-X (Fig. 1B) with three other groups of enzymes: fungal / plant RNA ligases, bacterial RNA ligases and fungal / plant cyclic phosphodiesterases. Together, the catalytic domains of these proteins form a superfamily of so-called 2H enzymes, which occur in evolutionary kingdoms ranging from bacteria to mammals [21]. The RNA ligases are involved in tRNA splicing. In bacteria and archaea, they join tRNA halfmolecules containing 2¢,3¢-cyclic phosphate and

5¢-hydroxyl termini. Plant and yeast cyclic phosphodiesterases (CPD or CPDase) hydrolyze ADP-ribose 1¢,2¢-cyclic phosphate to yield ADP-ribose 1¢-phosphate (at least one of these latter enzymes also hydrolyzes nucleoside 2¢,3¢-cyclic phosphates). CPDases are also thought to play a role in the tRNA splicing pathways. NMR titrations with CNPase inhibitors and mutagenesis studies of rat CNPase [20] in combination with the high-resolution crystal structure [22] of human CNPase catalytic domain have been used to propose a catalytic mechanism involving the catalytic H-X-(T / S)-X motifs. Here, we report the structure of the catalytic domain from goldfish RICH determined by NMR. We show that its structure and its active site are highly similar to that of the mammalian CNPase. NMR titrations with CNPase inhibitors identified the residues in RICH involved in inhibitor binding and suggest the proteins use a similar catalytic mechanism. These findings underline the importance of the evolutionarily conserved phosphodiesterase activity of 2H proteins and suggest that a not yet understood link exists between RNA metabolism and axon growth and maintenance.

Results
Structure of the RICH catalytic domain We determined the structure of the 24 kDa catalytic fragment of goldfish RICH protein (Fig. 2). The previously determined resonance assignments [23] were used to assign NOEs from 15N- and 13C-edited 3D NOESY

experiments (Fig. S1). The 10 structures with the lowest energy and least number of restraint violations were chosen to represent the final ensemble (Fig. 2A). The structural statistics are shown in Table 1. The folded domain extends from Leu175 to Phe386 and presents its N- and C-termini together close in space. This would position the N-terminal domain of full-length RICH protein relatively close to its

C-terminal isoprenylation site. This feature could be responsible for the smaller degree of association with the plasma membrane observed for RICH compared with CNPase [24] as the negative charge of the N-terminal domain of RICH should lead to electrostatic repulsion with the membrane. The catalytic domain of RICH is composed of a highly twisted antiparallel b-sheet consisting of nine b-strands (b1­b9) (Fig. 2B). Both sides of the b-sheet are covered with a-helices. The twisted nature of the b-sheet creates two extended grooves on the opposite sides of the protein, which are occupied by the longest helices a1 and a9. A number of short helical fragments group together in the vicinity of the N-terminus. This helical patch is the most basic part of the molecule and a potential interaction surface for the preceding acidic N-terminal domain. Structural comparison with CNP A structural similarity search using the Dali database [25] showed that the best hit (Z ¼ 21.0) was the cata-

lytic domain of CNPase (PDB code 1WOJ) with an ° rmsd of 2.8 A over 197 residues (Fig. 2C). The structural similarity to 2¢-5¢ RNA ligase (PDB code 1VDX) ° is much weaker with an rmsd of 5.3 A over 123 residues. As noticed previously [22], the NMR structure [20] of the rat CNPase catalytic domain contained an erroneously positioned helix. This was caused by the sparse number of NMR constraints in this part of the molecule. To address this, we measured residual dipolar couplings for the catalytic domain of rat CNPase using the C12E5 / hexanol liquid crystalline medium (data not shown). Analysis of these residual dipolar couplings added invaluable information about this region of the rat CNPase structure and allowed us to identify several misassigned NOE constraints. The structure was recalculated with the addition of residual dipolar coupling constraints and deposited to the RCSB database under the accession code 2ILX (supplementary Table S1). The corrected solution structure is in a good agreement with the crystal structure of human CNPase cata° lytic domain (rmsd of 2.3 A over 205 residues). Sequence alignment of the catalytic domain of RICH and related proteins (Fig. 1B) identifies the biggest difference between RICH and CNPase as the seven-residue insert in the helical region between b4 and b5 strands of RICH. This insert results in additional a-helical structure in RICH comprising helices a6 through a8 and causes this to be the most structurally dissimilar region when comparing the two proteins. The functional significance of this difference is unclear but, of note, the recently identified, CNPrelated protein from the puffer fish (gi:47207595) also contains a long 34-residue insert, on this side of the molecule, between helices a4 and a5 (Fig. 1B). The catalytic domains of RICH and CNPase differ significantly in their surface charges. This changes the overall highly positive charge of the CNPase catalytic domain to a surface dominated by negatively charged patches in RICH (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the region around the catalytic H-X-(T / S)-X motifs is relatively neutral in both RICH and CNP. Thus, it is likely that the overall charge difference between RICH and CNPase is more related to protein­partner interactions and less related to their catalytic activity on physiological substrate(s). We measured heteronuclear NOEs for the RICH catalytic domain to identify mobile regions of the structure. Besides the unstructured N-terminus, the most flexible part of the protein fragment is the internal loop immediately following the helix a2 (Fig. 3). This is highly reminiscent of CNP, where the corresponding region in the primary sequence, Gly208 to Lys214, produced the most

intense peaks in the 15N­1H heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy spectrum indicative of backbone flexibility [20]. This region is far from the nucleotide binding site (vide infra) and unlikely to play a role in catalysis. Binding to CNPase inhibitors To obtain more information about the active site of RICH, we titrated 15N-labeled catalytic domain of RICH with orthophosphate and the CNPase inhibitor, adenosine-3¢-monophosphate (3¢-AMP). The titrations were followed by 1H­15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectra and the shifts of amide signals as a function of ligand addition recorded. These signals act as a fingerprint to identify amino acid residues

affected by binding and to measure the binding affinity (Fig. 4). Titration of the catalytic domain of RICH with 3¢-AMP resulted in chemical shift changes of roughly 20 backbone amides, indicating binding to the protein. The biggest chemical shift changes were observed for Thr322 (0.67 p.p.m.), Thr236 (0.60 p.p.m.), Asp241 (0.36 p.p.m.), Val332 (0.35 p.p.m.), Gly335 (0.27 p.p.m.), Phe239 (0.27 p.p.m.) and Ala319 (0.27 p.p.m.) (Fig. 5A). Thr236 and Thr322 are part of the H-X-(T / S)-X motifs, which are essential for the catalytic activity of the related CNPase

[19,20]. Mapping of the chemical shift changes on the RICH catalytic domain structure (Fig. 5B) shows that all the changes are closely grouped in space, thereby unambiguously identifying this region as the catalytic site of the protein (Fig. 6). A similar pattern of chemical shift changes was observed for the rat CNPase catalytic domain [20], which confirms the structural and catalytic relatedness of the two proteins. The binding of orthophosphate results in chemical shift changes very similar to those observed upon binding of 3¢-AMP (Fig. 5C). As previously shown for CNPase [20,22], phosphate binds in the active site. Fewer residues are affected by phosphate binding, which reflects the smaller size of the phosphate group leading to a more local effect (Fig. 5D). Comparison of the 3¢-AMP and orthophosphate titrations allowed us to identify the residues of RICH affected by binding of the adenine group (Fig. 5E). Located in the loop between strand b2 and helix a2, Phe239 and Asp241 appear to be in a proximity of adenine base in the RICH / 3¢-AMP complex (Fig. 5F).

The NMR titration experiments also allowed us to estimate binding affinities. Under conditions of weak binding and fast exchange, the shifts of the signals in heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectra can be used to measure the amount of inhibitor bound. These shifts can be fitted using a simple equation, assuming Kd  [protein], to estimate the dissociation constant (Kd). The resulting values were 4.6 ± 0.3 and 12 ± 2 mm for 3¢-AMP and orthophosphate, respectively, binding to RICH (Fig. 4B and Fig. S2). In comparison, orthophosphate binding to CNPase shows an identical binding affinity (Kd of 12 ± 2 mm), while 3¢-AMP binds CNPase with a much better Kd of 0.57 ± 0.04 mm [20]. The physiological significance of the relatively poor affinity of catalytic domain of RICH for 3¢-AMP is unclear, since 3¢-AMP is not a substrate of CNPase activity.

Discussion
The role of 2H proteins in myelination and nerve growth remains mysterious. RICH shows highest structural similarity with CNPase in its catalytic domain and catalytic site, which suggests that the conserved 2¢,3¢-cyclic phosphodiesterase activity is important for the in vivo function of both proteins. The best-characterized members of the 2H protein superfamily are involved in RNA-processing pathways, specifically tRNA splicing and ligation. This leads to speculation about possible physiological substrate(s) for RICH and CNP. One of the mechanisms of tRNA splicing involves endonuclease cleavage of an intron-containing tRNA at two exon­intron borders, yielding 2¢,3¢-cyclic phosphates and 5¢-OH termini. Following cleavage, three reactions are required to put the ends of fragmented tRNA together: first, the 2¢,3¢-cyclic phosphate is hydrolyzed by a cyclic phosphodiesterase; secondly, the 5¢-OH terminus is phosphorylated by an NTPdependent polynucleotide kinase; and thirdly, the modified ends are joined by an ATP-dependent RNA ligase [26­31]. RNA ligases in plants and fungi consist of a single polypeptide chain with three domains. Despite the low sequence similarity, the domain organization of plant and fungal ligases is very similar: an N-terminal adenylyltransferase / ligase domain, followed by a polynucleotide kinase domain and a C-terminal cyclic phosphodiesterase domain (Fig. 1). In multicellular animals, all three domains are still essential, but are not necessarily in the same polypeptide [31]. The C-terminal domains in all these ligases contain two H-X-(T / S)-X motifs, which identify them as 2H

proteins. The central GTP-dependent polynucleotide kinase domain of yeast / plant tRNA ligases contains an NTP-binding P-loop consensus sequence of GxxGxGKS that is critical for function. The sequence of the putative P-loop in the N-terminal domain of CNPase (37GLPGSGK44S) is strikingly similar to that of plant tRNA ligases (GIPGSAKS for Arabidopsis thaliana) (Fig. 1; [32]), which reinforces the connection between CNPase and tRNA maturation. While CNPase is missing a ligase domain, this activity could be performed by another protein. In T4 bacteriophage, tRNA ligation is carried out by two different enzymes. The bifunctional enzyme T4 Pnk, which contains a P-loop (GCPGSGKS) almost identical to CNP, prepares the 3¢ and 5¢ ends of the cleaved tRNA, and T4 Rnl1 ligase reconnects the ends [33­35]. This advocates the hypothesis that CNPase is a functional homolog of T4 Pnk and participates in tRNA splicing and maturation. Intriguingly, the fish homolog of CNPase (gi:47207595) contains an additional N-terminal domain, which could potentially possess an adenylyltransferase activity (Fig. 1). While showing higher sequence homology to the fish CNPase (56% identity versus 47% identity to human or rat CNPase), RICH appears to lack both the adenylyltransferase and kinase domains; little is known about the function of its acidic N-terminal segment. The cellular localization of CNPase does not contradict its involvement in pre-tRNA splicing. Recent studies revealed that the yeast tRNA splicing endonuclease mainly localizes on mitochondria and this localization is important for its function [36]. Interestingly, one CNPase isoform (CNP2) is specifically targeted to mitochondria [37]. More intriguingly, RICH and CNPase may be involved in other RNA splicing events. XBP1 mRNA, in humans, and HAC1 mRNA, in yeast, undergo cytoplasmic splicing as part of the unfolded protein response that regulates the endoplasmic reticulum volume and protein composition [38]. While no 2¢,3¢-cyclic phosphate intermediates have been identified in these reactions or in regulation by micro RNAs, it is not impossible that the evolutionarily ancient phosphoesterase activity of 2H proteins is involved in regulating membrane biogenesis in oligodendrocytes or neurons via RNA. In conclusion, RICH proteins have been less characterized than mammalian CNPases, but the strong structural similarity of these proteins suggests a similar function. The structure of RICH and nucleotide binding studies presented here represent another step towards understanding of CNP / RICH function and suggest new avenues to study these still enigmatic proteins.

Solution structure of the RICH catalytic domain

Experimental procedures
Protein expression and purification
The catalytic domain of goldfish gRICH68 protein (residues 172­389) was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) and expressed in the Escherichia coli expression host BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) as a His-tagged fusion protein. The protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on Ni2+-loaded chelating sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Isotopically labeled RICH was prepared from cells grown on minimal M9 media containing 15N ammonium chloride and 13C glucose (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory, Andover, MA, USA). The N-terminal His-tag was cleaved from RICH by overnight dialysis with thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) at 1 unit per mg fusion protein at room temperature. Benzamidine sepharose and Ni2+-loaded chelating sepharose were used to remove thrombin and the His-tag peptide from RICH. The resulting 222 amino acid protein contained four N-terminal extraneous residues (GSHM) from the His tag. The sequence composition of purified RICH was confirmed by mass spectrometry.

rected for binding to RICH), and Kd is the dissociation constant. The fitting was carried out using the computer program grafit, version 3.0 (Ericathus Software, Horley, UK) to determine dmax and the Kd of binding.

Structure calculation
NOESY constraints for the structure determination were obtained from 15N-edited NOESY (mixing time 80 ms) and 13 C-edited NOESY (mixing time 80 ms) 3D experiments acquired on a Varian Unity Inova 800 MHz spectrometer at the Quebec-Eastern Canada High-Field NMR Facility. For the structure determination, a set of ARIA-assigned [41] and manually verified 1388 NOEs were collected from 15 N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra of RICH (172­389). Three hundred and twenty-two backbone angles resulted from chemical shift index using the TALOS database [42]. Hydrogen bonds were predicted from NOE analysis. The starting structure was generated with modeller 6v2 [43] using human CNPase crystal structure (PDB code 1WOJ) and was in agreement with manually assigned NOEs. One hundred and fifty structures were calculated and refined using standard protocols in cns v.1.1 [44]. procheck-nmr [45] was used to check the protein stereochemical geometry. The structural statistics for 10 structures are shown in Table 1. The coordinates have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) under PDB accession code 2I3E and the NMR assignments under BMRB accession number 7167.

NMR spectroscopy
NMR resonance assignments of the catalytic domain of RICH were determined previously [23]. All NMR experiments were recorded at 307 K. NMR samples were 1 mm protein in 50 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 6.0. NMR spectra were processed with nmrpipe [39] and xwinnmr software version 3 (Bruker Biospin) and analyzed with xeasy [40]. For titrations, 3¢-AMP and Na2HPO4 were purchased from Sigma (Saint-Louis, MO, USA) and used without any additional purification. Titrations were monitored by 15N-1H heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectra following addition of inhibitors to 15N-labeled RICH (172­389) on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer. The experiments were recorded with 128 increments using 4­8 scans and lasted for 10­20 min. Chemical shift changes were calculated as (DHN2 + (0.2*DN)2)1 / 2 in p.p.m. Samples contained 50 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 6.0 and 0.4­0.5 mm RICH at 307 K. The inhibitor concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 60 mm depending on the affinity and solubility of the inhibitor. The heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectra of complexes were assigned by monitoring chemical shift changes upon addition of the substrate, since the binding takes place in the fast exchange. The pH of the NMR samples was monitored during the titrations and adjusted as needed. Chemical shift changes for individual residues were fit to a one-site binding equation: d ¼ dmax Æ [L] / (Kd + [L]) where d is the chemical shift change, [L] is the total ligand concentration (uncor-
