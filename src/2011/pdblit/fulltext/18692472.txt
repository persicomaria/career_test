GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5: cross-competition on human haemopoietic cells
Angel F. Lopez, Michael J. Elliott, Joanna Woodcock and Mathew A. Vadas
The biological properties of GM-CSb; IL-3 and IL-5 are multiple; initially described as haemopoietic growth factors, they also regulate inflammation, allergic reactions and cell adherence. The receptors for these three cytokines share a common component which may play a key role in their biological activity. This review describes the potential roles of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 in inflammation and discusses approaches to modulate their function.
The multiple biological activities of granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interteukin 3 (IL-3) and IL-5 are determined by the variety of cells on which these factors act. Thus, GMCSF and IL-3 are pleiotropic, regulating several lineages (reviewed in Refs 1-3), while IL-5 is a more restricted factor, controlling mainly the eosinophil and basophil lineages (reviewed in Ref. 4). An intriguing property of these cytokines is their ability to act on overlapping cellular compartments. This redundancy is apparent in many lineages but is probably illustrated best in the case of the eosinophil, which is influenced by GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5. The n u m b e r s of eosinophils in the circulation and the functional status of these cells is influenced in the same way, and roughly to the same extent, by each of the cytokines s. The reason for this redundancy and the mechanism underlying it have remained elusive, but some clues have emerged with the characterization of the surface receptors for GM-CSF, !L-3 and IL-5. The cross-competition between GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 is notable for several significant features. First, it is a membrane phenomenon detected on the cell surface in the absence of receptor-transdownmodulation; second, it is manifested only on cells that bind more than one of these three cytokines, and, third, it is hierarchical in nature. The first feature distinguishes this phenomenon from a similar, but distinct, finding in the mouse, in which competition between different hemopoietic growth factors occurs at 37°C (Ref. 14). The competition in the mouse, which was observed in some cell lines and on unfractionated bone marrow cells 14, was not seen at 4°C. It has been termed 'receptor transdownmodulation'. Whether this phenomenon occurs on purified primary mouse cells is not known. The GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 cross-competition seen in humans occurs on the cell surface, as demonstrated by acid-elution experiments 1°,13. This feature, together with the manifestation of cross-competition on cells that can bind more than one of these three cytokines and the fact that the competition is only seen under GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 cross-competition high-affinity conditions, suggested that the receptors Receptors for human GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 have for these might contain an element that was common, been detected on the surface of transformed cell lines limiting and responsible for high-affinity binding. and purified human primary cells using a ligand that The molecular basis of this phenomenon was eluciwas radiolabelled to a high specific activity. The initial dated with the cloning of the different components of characterization of these receptors showed features the GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 receptors. Reconstitution similar to other cytokine receptors: for example, 12sI- experiments using the different chains of these receplabelled GM-CSF bound to human neutrophils and to tors have now shown that each receptor is composed cell lines with a high affinity and in a specific manner; of at least two chains: a ligand-specific alpha (~) chain, the binding was competed out by excess unlabelled which binds the cognate ligand with low affinity lsqs, cognate ligand but not by other cytokines 6, this resem- and a common beta ([3) chain which, although failing bled the properties noted for other human and mouse to bind to the ligand itself, confers high affinity-bindcytokines 7.

ferent receptor components has provided some mechanistic answers, while raising important biological questions. Below, we address some of these questions.
What are the functional roles of the GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 high- and low-affinity receptors? The fact that neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils express high-affinity receptors only, and are therefore capable of recognizing a very small n u m b e r of cytokine molecules, underscores the biological significance of these receptors. The binding of low concentrations of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 to these cells enhances diverse functions, such as antibody-dependent killing 2°-22, adherence to different surfaces 23, respiratory burst 22"24 and degranulation of their cellular contents 25. Monocytes exhibit high- as well as low-affinity receptors 1° and, while low concentrations of GM-CSF and IL-3 stimulate adherence of monocytes 23, higher concentrations are required to stimulate p r o l i f e r a t i o n 1°. M o n o c y t e s are the only mature myeloid cells in blood capable of undergoing proliferation, and other cell types capable of proliferation, such as acute non-lymphocytic leukaemic cells and KG-1 cells, also have low-affinity sites 9'26. This suggests a role for the unassociated 0~ chain in the process of cellular proliferation. The ]3 chain is involved in mature cell function. Structure-function studies of human GM-CSF (Ref. 27) have shown that the analog produced by substitution of Arg for Glu at position 21 binds to the GMCSF receptor 0~ chain with the same affinity as wildtype GM-CSF, but has a 100-300-fold lower affinity for GM-CSF high-affinity receptors; this implies a role for Glu 21 in binding to the ]3 chain. The Glu residues at equivalent positions in IL-3 (Glu 22) and IL-5 (Glu 10) probably subserve the same function. In fact, substitution of Glu 22 in IL-3 dramatically decreases IL-3 function and high-affinity binding 28. These GM-CSF (Ref. 27) and IL-3 (Ref. 28) mutants have a greatly diminished capacity to stimulate monocyte, eosinophil and basophil functions, implicating the 13 chain in signal transduction. The ]3 chain of these receptors may, therefore, play two crucial roles. First, it provides high-affinity binding, ensuring that very low levels of GM-CSF, IL-3 or IL-5 are sufficient for a full biological response. Secondly, it mediates signalling, even in the absence of high-affinity binding. This has been shown in experiments where (1) human GM-CSF receptor (x subunits were transfected into mouse cells expressing endogenous mouse [3 chain 29, and (2) by means of the human GM-CSF (Arg 21) mutant 27. In the first case, human GM-CSF bound to the transfected mouse cells with low affinity only and elicited a biological response 29, while in the latter case, GM-CSF (Arg 21), which is selectively deficient at recognizing the ]3 chain, functionally activates cells at concentrations required for low affinity (0t chain) receptor occupancy 27. These two types of experiments also suggest that ~x chain association to the ]3 chain may occur via an allosteric mechanism. The requirement of the ]3 chain for function is

(b) In the presence of large amounts of GM-CSF, however, the 'common' and 'limiting' ~ chain forms a high-affinity complex with the GM-CSF receptor cechain resulting in loss of 12S I-labelled IL-3 high-affinity binding. triggers the association of cognate ~ chain to the common [3 chain, postulates that remain to be tested experimentally. In addition, it is possible that other, as yet undescribed, molecules form part of these receptors. The different patterns of binding and cross-competition observed in many primary cell types might now be explained in the light of this model and the cloning of the different receptor components. Thus, for neutrophils, which show specific high-affinity binding of GM-CSF and do not bind IL-3 or IL-5, there is an absence of competition among the factors, probably because neutrophils express only the GM-CSF receptor 0t and [3 chains. The levels of expression of the (~ chain may be the same or less than that of the [3 chain, accounting for the lack of low affinity GM-CSF binding (Fig. 2). Monocytes, which bind IL-3 and GM-CSF but not IL-5, are the only primary cells that express both low- and high-affinity receptors, implying an excess of GM-CSF and IL-3 ~ chains over the common [3 chain (Fig. 2). Eosinophils express all three receptors, indicating the presence of the three ~ chains and display only high-affinity binding and cross-competition, suggesting the presence of the ]3 chain in numbers similar to each of the ~ chains but lower than the three chains combined (Fig. 2). This simplified model may increase in complexity with the understanding of the role of 0~]3 complexes expressed as monomers or oligomers in determining affinities, and with the identification of new receptor components. The hierarchical nature of the GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 cross-competition remains unexplained. For eosinophils the binding hierarchy is GM-CSF > IL-3 > IL-5 (Ref. 13). This may be a reflection of (1) a difference in the number of 0t chains for each cytokine, (2) the ability of each 0t chain to associate to the common ]3 chain, or (3) differences in the association kinetics of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 to their receptor.

emphasized by the inability of the (z chain alone to mediate signalling in IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells, which do not express endogenous mouse [3 chain ~°. The contribution of the (z chain is probably to provide the initial association with the cognate ligand, determining specificity, while association with the 13 chain is necessary to trigger function. The ~ chains of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 receptors exhibit conserved motifs in the extracellular domains which might be required for association to the common 13chain 3~, and each contains a highly conserved intracellular prolinerich motif which might play a role in associating to the 13chain and contribute to signal transduction ~6'3~.
What is the significance of the GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 cross-competition in inflammation?

Since the 13chain appears to function in mature cells as a signal transduction molecule, its' presence may help 'unify' and 'limit' signalling. That signalling is unified in mature cells is suggested by the fact that, whenever receptors for these cytokines are expressed on a cell, the corresponding ligands elicit the same functional responses. Thus, GM-CSF and IL-3 stimulate early- and late-phase monocyte adherence 23, and upregulate the same adhesion molecules 23. GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 stimulate eosinophil-mediated phagocytosis 2-''32'~3, degranulation 2s and proteoglycan production34; and histamine release from basophils ~2'~s. Perhaps the most important physiological (as opposed to pathophysiological) function of these cytokines is that of enhancing cell survival 32'36"37, probably by inhibiting apoptosis ~s. This unifying mechanism may ensure that cell numbers are maintained whenever any of these cytokines are present. The cross-competition can also be viewed as a mechanism by which one cytokine 'sequesters' the common [3 chain, and prevents the concomitant binding of the other two, thereby limiting excessive stimulation with potential deleterious effects to the host. This is illustrated by additive experiments with GM-CSF and IL-3 where the addition of supramaximal doses of these factors together did not stimulate monocyte 23 or eosinophil (authors' unpublished observations) function above each of these factors alone. In contrast, either of these factors is additive with tumour necrosis factor in the stimulation of eosinophil function (authors' unpublished observations) indicating that further cellular stimulation can be achieved. The cellular functions stimulated at an inflammatory site are, therefore, determined by the types of cytokines produced, not by selectivity in functions stimulated in a particular cell type, but by the range of cell types upon which they act. The production of IL-5, for example, will result in the stimulation of eosinophils but not neutrophils, with a subsequent allergic response, while production of GM-CSF or IL-3 will lead to the stimulation of neutrophils or monocytes, leading to acute or chronic forms of inflammation. Despite the similarities in binding and functional effects of these cytokines, some qualitative differences between the actions of GM-CSF and IL-3 have been described, and these may be of relevance in inflam-

Fig. 3. Potential means of modulating the functions triggered by GM-CSF, IL3 and IL-5 receptors. (a) A soluble IL-5 receptor a chain can selectively prevent IL-5-mediated signalling, and a soluble ~ chain fragment may prevent some forms of signalling by all three factors. This model presumes that intracellular association of ~ and ~ chains is required for their signalling. (b) Antibodies to the combining site in the ot chain or [3 chain may prevent selective ligands or all ligands respectively to bind and to signal. Antibodies to sites on the a or ~ chains that prevent chain-chain association may also inhibit signalling. In contrast, nonblocking antibodies capable of crosslinking a chains or ~ chains may behave as functional agonists, either selectively (in the case of the a chain), or with all three cytokine properties (in the case of the chain). (c) Loss of binding to the ~ chain (low-affinity only (LAO) cytokines), can result in greatly reduced functional activation, as illustrated by GM-CSFArg21 (Ref. 27). This may be accentuated if LAO cytokines are used as a homodimer or extend their spectrum if combined with another LAO cytokine to form a heterodimer.

A striking feature of the biological effects of GMCSF, IL-3 and IL-5 on myeloid cells is that these factors operate differently on immature proliferating progenitor cells and mature end-stage myeloid cells. GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 have additive effects on progenitor cells: GM-CSF and IL-3 together stimulate greater numbers of cells per colony than either of them alone4°, and both have an additive effect with IL-5 in stimulating eosinophil production 41,42. It is possible that, in progenitor cells, the cz chains can directly deliver a growth signal, perhaps by coupling to signal transduction mechanisms absent or switched off in the mature cells. Alternatively, and in contrast to mature cells, progenitors may have sufficient ('non-limiting') amounts of [3 chains to associate with the different cz chains, allowing ligands to bind to, and signal through, ot[Bhigh-affinity receptor complex. If this is the case, GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 cross-competition would not be expected to occur. It will be important to measure the relative amounts of each receptor chain by ligand-independent methods, for example using monoclonal antibodies. The relationship between the functions of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 during haemopoiesis, and the role of each receptor component, is not clear. While the [3 chain is likely to be the major transducer in activated non-dividing mature cells, dissection of the role of the c~and 13chains in progenitor cells is complicated by the fact that these cells undergo proliferation as well as differentiation. It is possible that, since the common denominator of progenitor cells of different lineages is proliferation, this may be mediated by the common [3 chain, while the selective differentiation to a particular lineage may be governed by the presence of the specific (z chains. Clues to this process may be obtained by examining the temporal expression of appearance of the different cz and [3 chains during cell differentiation using purified progenitor cell populations, and relating this to their biological response to GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5. Similarly, the expression of these chains may be regulated by other cytokines present in the microenvironment as well as by adhesion molecules. A role for GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 receptors in adhesion, their relationship to attachment to stromal cells, endothelial cells and emigration, may yield useful information into as yet unexplored new functions for these molecules.
What is the significance of the expression of multiple GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 receptor forms?

An unusual feature of the GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 receptors is their expression as soluble forms as well as membrane-anchored proteins. The soluble forms of other receptors that have been described, such as the TNF-0t receptors43 and the nerve growth factor receptor 44, arise by proteolytic cleavage at the cell surface; in

contrast, the GM-CSF and IL-5 receptor soluble isoforms arise from translation of specific mRNA, and are the product of differential splicing l:'~s,4s,4~. Soluble isoforms for the IL-3 receptor have not yet been described but they are likely to exist. The significance of expression of soluble receptor forms is not clear but they may represent a fled-back control mechanism, whereby excess cytokine is neutralized by released soluble receptor. Alternatively, they may play the role of transporter molecules, carrying bound ligand to sites, such as inflammatory fool, where acidic conditions release the ligand locally. Lastly, the release of soluble receptor forms into the immediate extracellular milieu may allow the ligand to become matrix-bound and to serve adhesion or growth factor purposes. It is intriguing that eosinophils, which are one of the major cell types present in allergic reactions, express mainly mRNA for the soluble form of the IL-5 receptor ~:'ls. Although soluble receptor protein has not been found, this differential receptor expression suggests that soluble IL-5 receptor production is an important role for the eosinophil. In this context, it is interesting that in recent experiments in IL-5 transgenic mice suprastimulated for IL-5 production by infection with Mesocestoides corti eosinophil production was turned off, despite the enormous quantities of 1L-5 (Ref. 47). Whether or not this negative regulation is due to release of soluble IL-5 receptor remains to be established. From a therapeutic point of view, it will be important to understand what stimuli control the expression of either form of the receptor, as the phenomenon may be amenable to exogenous control.
How can GM-CSF-, IL-3- and IL-5- mediated signalling be prevented? GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 may play a role in disease by exacerbating inflammation or facilitating turnout cell growth. For example, GM-CSF has been found in the joint fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis4S; IL-3 receptors and IL-3 dependence for growth has been noted in follicular cell lymphomas 49, and mRNA for IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF have been detected in allergic situations, such as nasal mucosa after antigen provocation"' and allergen-induced late-phase cutaneous reactions sl. Given the molecular nature of the GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 receptor complex, three approaches may be envisaged to modulate the biological effects of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5, either individually or as a group. First, the use of 0~ chain soluble forms would facilitate the selective removal of one ligand (Fig. 3(a)). A prerequisite for this approach would be the inability of a soluble ~ chain-ligand complex to associate to the cellular 13 chain, thereby triggering a signal (as is the case with the IL-6 receptorS-'). Recent experiments suggest that this approach is viable, at least in the case of the IL-5 receptor, for which the soluble ~ chain-ligand complex does not lead to [3 chain-mediated cellular activationJL Utilizing a soluble 13 chain may be favoured if stimulation by all three cytokines is to be

prevented {Fig. 3(a)). The use of soluble/truncated receptor forms may allow high-affinity binding on the cell surface without inducing the extracellular or intracellular association of 0t and 13chains which is likely to be required for function. A second approach involves the development of antibodies specific for cz and 13 chains (Fig. 3(b)). Antibodies to different domains may be raised, and these may interfere with either ligand-binding or ct chain-13 chain interaction. Antibodies to domains in the ~ chains may selectively inhibit one ligand-mediated stimulation, while antibodies to critical domains in the 13 chain would inhibit all three cytokines. It should be noted that, although all three ligands utilize the same 13 chain, it is not yet clear whether they recognize a single binding domain or three separate sites on this chain. Although there is no significant sequence homology between GM-CSF, IL-3 and 1L-5, the fact that they share a glutamic acid at equivalent positions, and that this is required for high-affinity binding -'-'2s, suggests that they recognize a common domain in the 13 chain. The localization of this domain has not yet been achieved, but its identification would constitute a useful focus for the development of antibodies or other binding molecules. It may also be possible to develop antibodies that can mimic the effect of the ligands. If [[3 chain-13 chain association is sufficient for activation, antibodies that crosslink the t3 chain may behave as agonists which, by utilizing the common 13chain, may combine the stimulatory effects of (;M-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 in one molecule. Alternatively, if ~ chain-13 chain association is essential for activation, antibodies bearing one Fab fragment for an ~ chain and a second Fab fragment for the 13 chain may be engineered, substituting for each ligand. A third approach is the use of mutated GM-CSF, IL3 or IL-5 molecules which have lost the property of interacting with one chain of the receptor complex; these may behave as chain-selective agonists, or as antagonists. This type of mutant is illustrated by GMCSF(Arg 21), a GM-CSF molecule with a single amino acid substitution that has lost its ability to interact with high-affinity receptors but fully recognizes the GM-CSF receptor c~ chain 2~. Thus, this mutant offers the possibility of eliciting c~ chain-mediated functions but is defective in eliciting !3 chain (or high-affinity)mediated functions. This impairment of the 13 chainmediated function may pave the way for the design of antagonists. Although the mutated molecule is of low affinity, its avidity may be increased if used as a homodimer. This approach could also make use of analogous IL-3 mutants, in the form of a GM-CSF-IL3 mutant heterodimer with the potential to antagonize GM-CSF- and IL-3-mediated effects simuhaneously (Fig. 3(c)). Since receptor activation can also take place under conditions of low-affinity binding e~'eg, implying an extracellular (allosteric interaction) or intracellular association of the ~ and [3 chains, mutated molecules that have retained binding capacity but have an impaired ability to induce this association may also

have antagonistic potential. Despite these uncertainties, it is clear that the u n d e r s t a n d i n g of the structure-function relationships of GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-5 and their receptors may herald the arrival of new strategies for the design of therapeutically useful molecules.
