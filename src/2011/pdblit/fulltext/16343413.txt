Abstract By removing the enolpyruvyl group from chorismate, chorismate lyase (CL) produces p-hydroxybenzoate (p-HB) for the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway. We have analyzed CL by several spectroscopic and chemical techniques and measured its kinetic (kcat = 1.7 s31 , Km = 29 WM) and product inhibition parameters (Kp = 2.1 WM for p-HB). Protein aggregation, a serious problem with wild type CL, proved to be primarily due to the presence of two surface-active cysteines, whose chemical modification or mutation (to serines) gave greatly improved solution behavior and minor effects on enzyme activity. CL is strongly inhibited by its product p-HB ; for this reason activity and inhibition measurements were analyzed by both initial rate and progress curve methods. The results are consistent, but in this case where the stable enzyme^product complex rapidly becomes the predominant form of the enzyme, progress curve methods are more efficient. We also report inhibition measurements with several substrate and product analogs that give information on ligand binding interactions of the active site. The biological function of the unusual product retention remains uncertain, but may involve a mechanism of directed delivery to the membrane-bound enzyme that follows CL in the ubiquinone pathway.

and iron-chelating siderophores. In addition to their metabolic functions, native and derivative products of the chorismate pathway have industrial applications, such as aspartame derived from phenylalanine, indigo from tryptophan, and high-value plastics from p-hydroxybenzoate (p-HB) [1,2]. A seven-step pathway leads from erythrose-4phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate to chorismate. Five separate enzymes then metabolize chorismate and the resulting products represent the ¢rst committed steps to various end products ([3,4] and others in this series). Thus chorismate serves as a critical branch point. In order to understand quantitatively how carbon £ux through this central metabolic intermediate is controlled, thermodynamic and kinetic measurements are needed for each of these ¢ve en-

Fig. 1. CL, encoded by the gene ubiC, produces p-HB (and the product pyruvate) in the ¢rst committed step toward the synthesis of ubiquinone from chorismate. A hydrophobic tail is then added to p-HB by the second enzyme, 4-HB octaprenyl transferase.

zyme reactions. Thermodynamic data for the ¢ve enzyme reactions have been reported in the literature [5^9]. However, except for anthranilate synthase and chorismate mutase, less is known about the structural, mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the ¢ve enzymes that process chorismate. Chorismate lyase (CL) begins the pathway leading to the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. CL cleaves a carbon^oxygen bond to release pyruvate and aromatize the ring, producing p-HB (CAS 99-96-7) also called 4-hydroxybenzoate. In the Escherichia coli pathway, the soluble CL [10^12] is directly followed by the membrane-bound p-HB octaprenyl transferase [13], which adds a hydrophobic tail that becomes ubiquinone's membrane anchor (Fig. 1). The gene for CL from E. coli (UbiC) was cloned separately by Siebert et al. and Nichols and Green [10,12]. The enzyme contains 164 amino acids (Nterminal methionine removed) with a molecular weight of 18 645 Da and functions as a monomer [12]. The enzyme does not depend on any cofactor, but ionic strength increases activity [11]. Measurements of Km for chorismate have been reported in the range of 6^10 WM [11,12]. It was noted by Siebert et al. [11] that the enzyme was inhibited by p-HB, but not by pyruvate, and that the conversion was irreversible. An equilibrium constant of V1037 M has been determined for the conversion of chorismate to

pyruvate plus p-HB [8]. The enzyme is fairly speci¢c for the lyase reaction. Siebert et al. reported [11] no detection of salicylate by conversion of isochorismate by CL. Nichols and Green [12] investigated whether CL could use 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate as a substrate but did not ¢nd a signi¢cant quantity of product. However, they were able to complement a pabC mutant (amino deoxychorismate lyase) with the ubiC overproducing plasmid, suggesting that CL can metabolize 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate at some level. In the current investigation, we measured the kinetic parameters of CL catalysis, and its product inhibition. Chemical and molecular biology methods were utilized to alter two surface cysteine residues so that the propensity of the enzyme to aggregate was greatly diminished while retaining catalytic activity. Due to the rapid in£uence of product inhibition on the initial reaction rate, we used progress curve analysis of stopped-£ow kinetic measurements to complement standard initial rate analysis for the purpose of quantifying the parameters of the reaction rate model. Finally, we compared the inhibition by p-HB to that of several product analogs in order to learn more about structural determinants of p-HB binding. The results and conclusions derived from this work will be discussed in light of the recently determined crystal structure of CL [14].

2. Materials and methods 2.1. CL protein production and puri¢cation CL was over-expressed in E. coli (XL1-Blue) by transformation of cells with the plasmid vector pSE380 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing the ubiC gene. Mutations to the ubiC gene were accomplished using the QuikChange1 site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The mutations were veri¢ed by DNA sequencing using Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing1 reactions and a 373 DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Cells were grown in batch culture in rich unde¢ned medium (Terri¢c broth) [15] at 30³C. Protein production was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl L-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) during log phase growth. Cell lysis and the ¢rst two steps of CL protein puri¢cation is as described in Tewari et al. [8]. Final puri¢cation of CL was achieved with gel ¢ltration chromatography (Sephacryl 200 HR1). The column was equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate bu¡er (pH 7.5), 4 mM DTT and 100 mM (NH4 )2 SO4 . CL was puri¢ed to homogeneity as determined by 1D and 2D SDS^PAGE using precast gradient (10^20)% minigels (Bio-Rad, Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Yields of puri¢ed CL ranged between (1^2) mg g31 wet cell mass, or (10^30) mg l31 of cell culture. Protein determination was performed by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay1 using BSA as a standard. Chemical modi¢cation of the cysteines in wild type and C14S CL utilized DTNB [5,5P-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)] [16]. The puri¢cation protocol was modi¢ed for the C14S/C81S double-cysteine mutant CL protein (CCSS CL). The bulk of the CCSS CL protein remained on the phenyl Sepharose1 column after the (NH4 )2 SO4 gradient was completed (second puri¢cation step). The column was washed with 5 mM potassium phosphate bu¡er before CCSS CL was eluted with 1 mM p-HB in the same bu¡er. DTT was omitted from all chromatography bu¡ers when the CCSS mutant was being puri¢ed. 2.2. Chorismic acid preparation Due to impurities in commercial chorismate prep-

arations, we prepared and puri¢ed chorismic acid (CAS 617-12-9) from E. coli KA12, a chorismate mutase mutant, according to the protocol of Grisostomi et al. [17]. The protocol was modi¢ed by adding trace mineral supplements to the growth medium (0.010 g l31 FeCl2 W4H2 O, 0.002 g l31 ZnCl2 , 0.003 g l31 NaMoO4 W2H2 O, 0.002 g l31 CaCl2 , 0.001 g l31 MnCl2 W4H2 O, 0.0001 g l31 H3 BO3 , 0.0001 g l31 CoCl2 W6H2 O, 0.0001 g l31 CuSO4 W5H2 O). As a ¢nal puri¢cation step, chorismate was crystallized according to the protocol of Addadi et al. [18]. Crystals were dissolved in a minimum amount of ether, recrystallized and ¢ltered two more times, and dried in a vacuum desiccator for 1.5 h. Analysis of the puri¢ed chorismic acid for other organics, residual solvents and water was done by HPLC, GC and Karl^Fisher titration, respectively. The HPLC analysis was performed on a Bio-Rad fermentation-monitoring column (150 mmU7.8 mm) that is a resin-based ion-exchange column in the hydrogen form (mobile phase A = 0.005 mol dm33 H2 SO4 , mobile phase B = acetonitrile; 0 min = 4% B, 4 min = 4% B, 30 min = 30% B; column temperature = 40³C; £ow rate = 0.8 ml min31 ). Response factors were measured for chorismate, pyruvate, phenylpyruvate, and p-HB. Residual prephenate in the sample is spontaneously converted to phenylpyruvate due to the acid conditions. The purity of the chorismate was s 99% (m/m) based on quantitation of pyruvate, phenylpyruvate, and p-HB in the ¢nal preparation and veri¢ed using absorbance at 275 nm (O = 2.63 mM31 cm31 ). 2.3. CL activity assays CL activity was assayed using a coupled assay protocol similar to that of Siebert et al. [11]. Pyruvate, a product of the CL reaction, was coupled with NADH oxidation in a second reaction that was not rate limiting. The concentrations of reactants in the standard assay were 200 WM NADH, 500 WM chorismate, 5 U ml31 lactate dehydrogenase and 200 mM NaCl in a bu¡er of 50 mM Tris^HCl, pH 7.5. CL protein preparations that contained p-HB were treated to remove the p-HB using bu¡er exchange through centrifugal concentrators (Centricon-10, Millipore). First, assay bu¡er (50 mM Tris^HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2 mM

The reported error for each parameter represents two standard deviations resulting from the regression analysis (Fig. 2). b Kinetic parameters determined by global progress curve analysis (Fig. 3).

vanillic acid was used to displace p-HB from the CL active site. Then assay bu¡er, devoid of vanillic acid, was exchanged through the protein sample, removing the vanillic acid. HPLC analysis was conducted as described in Section 2.2 to verify that p-HB and vanillic acid constituted less than 1 mol% and 5 mol% of the CL sample, respectively. Stopped-£ow kinetic measurements were performed on wild type and CCSS mutant CL using an OLIS RSM-16 dual beam monochromotor ¢tted with a stopped-£ow apparatus (OLIS, Bogart, GA, USA). Assays were conducted in reaction medium similar to that described above for the standard CL assay except LDH was raised to 25 U ml31 . Chorismate concentration was varied from 10^550 WM and p-HB was 0, 2, 5 or 10 WM. The CL concentration was 1.5 WM. The kinetic parameters Km , Kp , and kcat for wild type and CCSS CL were determined by both initial rate and progress curve analysis. For progress curve analysis [19], kinetic measurements were made at seven chorismate concentrations (10^150 WM) for both 0 WM and 10 WM p-HB. This method of kinetic analysis ¢ts assay measurements to the integrated form of the Michaelis^Menten equation and is especially useful under tight product binding. The method has the advantages of utilizing the entire (linear and postlinear) set of reaction rate vs. time measurements and of ¢tting multiple kinetic runs simultaneously. The initial conditions ([CHR]0 , [p-HB]0 , [CL]0 ) and time-dependent [p-HB] measurements serve as inde-

pendent variables that determine values for the desired parameters Km , kcat , and Kp . Uncertainties in starting concentrations were estimated to be 2% for [chorismate] and [p-HB], and 3% for [enzyme]. The standard deviation of the [p-HB] measurements over time (obtained from averaging replicate assays), and the deviation from ideal ¢t of each progress curve were incorporated in error estimates of the ¢nal parameter values according to standard statistical methods [20]. The total standard deviation for each parameter re£ects the four input standard deviations combined in quadrature. The error given in Table 1 for each kinetic parameter equals twice the standard deviation of that parameter. Inhibition constants Ki were determined for both products and for several substrate and product analogs [vanillic acid (3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, CAS 121-34-6), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (CAS 12308-0), 3-carboxymethylaminomethyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (CAS 55739-39-4), p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, CAS 150-13-0), 4-hydroxyisophthalic acid (CAS 636-46-4), and benzoic acid (CAS 65-85-0)]. The initial rate inhibition at several concentrations of p-HB was measured and compared with inhibition due to the analogs. The e¡ect of excess pyruvate

The inhibition constant for p-HB was determined by both initial rate and progress curve analysis. Inhibition constants for the remaining compounds were determined relative to p-HB (see Section 2).

(pyruvic acid, CAS 127-17-3) on activity was tested without lactate dehydrogenase and NADH, and absorbance was followed at 285 nm (wavelength of maximum di¡erence in absorbance between chorismate and p-HB). The inhibition constants (KiYx ) given in Table 2 for the above compounds are calculated as the p-HB inhibition constant (Kp = 2.1 WM) multiplied by the concentration ratio of inhibitor ([x]) to p-HB ([P]) that exhibits the same percent inhibition of initial rate: KiYx = KpÃ [x]/[P]. Compounds that did not produce a statistically signi¢cant inhibitory e¡ect were given an upper bound Ki based on the highest tested concentration. 2.4. Circular dichroism (CD) CD spectra were measured using an Olis CD spectrometer. The temperature of the cuvette (0.2 mm pathlength) was controlled by a circulating water bath. The temperature of the protein solution in the cuvette was measured using a calibrated thermistor. Data were collected over the temperature range 20^64³C and over the wavelength range 185^250 nm, with 1^1.75 nm between points. 3. Results and discussion The enzyme CL from E. coli has been engineered to improve solubility and stability, and its kinetic and ligand binding parameters have been measured. Aggregation of the wild type was found to be largely due to the two cysteines, and was mitigated without loss of activity by DTT, chemical modi¢cation using DTNB [16], or Cys to Ser mutations. The doubleserine mutant (CCSS) has markedly improved solubility and crystallization behavior [21], and binds more tightly to the hydrophobic interaction column than the wild type enzyme, indicating a change in surface properties. The mutations had minor e¡ects on catalytic properties (see below). The recently reported crystal structure of CCSS CL with bound product 1fw9.pdb [14], shows that both cysteines are exposed, on distinct regions of the protein surface. Their respective distances from the active site are: Cys 14, 2.1 nm, and Cys 81, 1.1 nm. These structural data are consistent with the observed changes in solution and crystallization behavior,

but fail to explain e¡ects on the inhibition parameter Kp . The unusual product retention of this enzyme (10fold stronger a¤nity for product vs. substrate) complicates measurement of its kinetic parameters. It is di¤cult to quantitatively (while non-destructively) remove bound product from the enzyme; direct dialy-

Initial linear rates were calculated using 1 s of data (within the ¢rst 2 s of reaction). Multiple assays were conducted for each data point from which the error bars were calculated. Non-linear regression analysis was conducted on the curves and the calculated parameters (Km and kcat ) are reported in Table 1. (B) Calculation of Kp came from assays conducted with variable quantities of p-HB. One experiment with CCSS CL is shown, see Table 1 for calculated Kp .

sis is not e¡ective. We found the substrate/product analog and weak inhibitor vanillate to be useful in displacing bound product; the vanillate itself was then removable by dialysis. We have obtained accurate kinetic measurements shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 only after minimizing the product-bound, inhibited fraction at the start of the reaction. Contamination of chorismate samples by product (produced through

Kinetic assays that were analyzed by initial rate methods were also subjected to progress curve analysis using the entire 30-s progress curve. In each analysis, 14 assays (each repeated multiple times) using seven chorismate concentrations and two initial p-HB concentrations are simultaneously ¢t to the integrated form of the product-inhibited Michaelis^Menten equation. Six representative progress curves of a total of fourteen for a single experiment with wild type (a) and CCSS CL (b) are displayed, along with the best-¢t curves derived from the kinetic parameters.

non-enzymatic breakdown of chorismate) was controlled by purifying and analyzing the chorismate we produced for our kinetic assays. These factors likely account for the discrepancy between our Km determination (29 WM) and those reported previously (6^9 WM) [11,12]. Because product inhibition limits catalytic turnover within seconds, standard linear initial rate methods are ine¤cient for measuring kinetic parameters. For this reason we utilized progress curve methods that ¢t data from the entire non-linear (progressively inhibited) course of the reaction (Fig. 3 and Table 1). We found that the two methods gave generally similar results when the initial rate measurements are conducted under conditions that minimize non-enzymatic p-HB production (short assays and lower temperatures), but that progress curve methods require less material and fewer experimental runs. These ¢ndings demonstrate the suitability of global progress curve analysis to cases of competitive product inhibition. Our results indicate a kcat for wild type CL of 1.7 31 s , or about a million times faster than the nonenzymatic conversion (¢rst order rate constant 1U10 36 s31 [22,23]). This degree of acceleration is similar to that observed for the enzyme chorismate mutase, which catalyzes the Claisen rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate [22]. The cysteine-free CL double mutant, which showed markedly improved solution behavior, had slightly altered kinetic properties including stronger inhibition by product (Table 1). Measurements of product inhibition are also supported by the crystal structure, which shows that CL binds its product internally, with ¢ve direct hydrogen bonds, extensive van der Waals contact, and two overlying £aps that are connected by three additional H-bonds. While the crystal structure provides no direct information on substrate binding, the structure is consistent with high product a¤nity and provides a starting point for modeling studies involving substrate and analogs. We tested several substrate and product analogs for their ability (relative to p-HB) to inhibit the CL enzymatic reaction (Table 2). Consistent with previous reports [11], pyruvate does not inhibit at concentrations up to 20 mM. Results from the p-HB analogs show that the enzyme is generally intolerant of even single-atom changes in ligand structure. The ine¡ectiveness of p-amino-ben-

zoate as an inhibitor indicates that the hydroxyl group is a key binding determinant. Replacement of the carboxylate by an aldehyde group produces a weak inhibitor. Two other inhibitors that feature substrate-like extensions from the ring's meta position (vanillate and a 3-carboxymethylaminomethyl analog) bind weakly and are candidates for structure studies that may shed light on how chorismate binds. Both wild type and CCSS CL were analyzed using CD. The presence of a single minimum around 216 nm and a maximum at 198 nm is consistent with a structure dominated by L sheet [24], consistent with the crystal structure [14]. CD scans over increasing temperatures showed that both forms of the protein gradually precipitated without signi¢cant unfolding over the temperature range 20^64³C, suggesting that hydrophobic surface or near-surface interactions, rather than global unfolding, may trigger thermal aggregation. This tendency to aggregate without unfolding is similar to e¡ects reported for A-L-1^40 amyloid protein [25] and for RNase A [26,27]. CL has a relatively low density of surface charges, consistent with its lack of binding to both anion and cation exchange media at neutral pH. The protein does bind hydrophobic interaction media (phenyl Sepharose), especially the CCSS mutant. The crystal structure shows an unusually large fraction of surface exposed hydrophobic side chains [14]. The unusual product retention of CL may have a role in a mechanism for controlling p-HB and resulting ubiquinone production. Chorismate is metabolized by ¢ve di¡erent enzymes, and the cell must balance carbon £ow among these pathways. Whereas the chorismate-utilizing enzymes that lead to aromatic amino acids are feedback-regulated in E. coli, no such regulation has been uncovered for the ubiquinone pathway. The high level of product inhibition of CL may represent a control mechanism for the ubiquinone pathway. The sequestering of p-HB by CL might also help to direct p-HB to the next enzyme in its pathway, p-HB octaprenyl transferase (Fig. 1). The transferase enzyme is membrane-bound, as is its product, 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate [13], and all subsequent metabolites to ubiquinone. We have reported kinetic and binding measurements for an unusually dynamic protein. The £aps that cover the CL active site clearly must open to admit substrate and to release product [14]. After

binding the substrate (Km = 29 WM), the enzyme releases pyruvate quickly and then retains the product p-HB with a higher a¤nity (Kp = 2.3 WM). In the structure, the p-HB is completely buried with no space at either meta position to accommodate the pyruvyl group. This implies that protein groups, probably the £aps, adjust to ¢ll the space vacated by the pyruvate leaving group. Future work will focus on these dynamic protein rearrangements, on measurements of on and o¡ rates for p-HB and analogs, and on the e¡ects of mutations and chemical modi¢cations on the activity and product inhibition of this enzyme.
