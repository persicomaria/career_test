A-DNA conformation is favored by guanine-rich sequences, such as (dG)n´(dC)n, or under low-humidity conditions. Earlier A-DNA crystal structures revealed some conformational variations which may be the result of sequencedependent effects and/or crystal packing forces. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of d(AGGGGCCCCT) in two crystal forms (either in the P212121 or the P6122 space group) to gain insights into the conformation and dynamics of the (dG)n´(dC)n sequence. The P212121 form has been analyzed using data to Ê 1.1 A resolution by the anisotropic temperature factor refinement procedure of the shelx97 program. Such analysis affords us with the detailed geometric, conformational and motional property of an A-DNA structure. The backbone torsional angles fall in a narrow range, except for the a/g angles which have two distinct combinations (gauche2/ gauche+ or trans/trans). An A-DNA model of poly(dG)´poly(dC) has been constructed using the conformational parameters derived from the crystal structure of the P212121 form. In the crystal structure of the P6122 space group, the central eight base pairs of the decamer adopt A-DNA conformation with the two terminal nucleotides flipped out to form base pairs with the neighboring nucleotides. Comparison of the A-DNA structure of the same sequence from two different crystal forms, reinforced the conclusion that molecules crystallized in the same space group have a more similar conformation, whereas the same molecule crystallized in different space groups has different (local) conformations. Keywords: DNA conformation; A-DNA; atomic resolution structure; metal ions; X-ray diffraction; DNA dynamics. The polymorphic property of DNA conformation plays an important role in DNA function [1]. B-DNA may be converted to A-DNA reversibly, depending on a number of factors including sequence, chemical structure, humidity, and counter ions. Binding of protein to DNA may also promote A-DNA structure as seen in the case of the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) complexed to the TATA-containing sequence which results in a wide and shallow DNA minor groove [2,3]. Recently it has been shown that the hyperthermophilic chromosomal proteins Sac7d/Sso7d bind and kink DNA sharply and cause the DNA to have a significantly widened minor groove, reminiscent of A-DNA [4,5]. Some anti-cancer antibiotics, like chromomycin A3 and mithramycin, also bind to the wide and shallow minor groove of the A-like structure of DNA containing a GGCC core sequence [6]. There have been several crystallographic studies of A-DNA structures derived from G/C-rich oligonucleotides, including examples of DNA hexamer [7], octamers [8±10], decamers [11±15], and dodecamers [16,17]. More recently, the A-DNA structures available in the Nucleic Acids Database have been reviewed [18]. These structures, most of them determined at Ê <1.7±2.0 A resolution, generally resemble the canonical A-DNA duplex. However, despite similar global conformations, the molecules show significant variations in their local structures. It was noted that molecules crystallized in the same space group have a more similar conformation, whereas the same

molecule crystallized in different space groups has different (local) conformations [14]. When the local structures derived from those medium resolution A-DNA structures were investigated, a notable feature was that the backbone conformations have a large spread in their torsional angular distributions [19]. From an energetic point of view, this seems contradictory to the known rigidity of A-DNA ± one might expect that A-DNA backbone conformations would be more uniform. It is possible that those observed variations may be the result of lowresolution structural analysis. Indeed, a number of B-DNA structures related to the sequences of d(CGCGAATTCGCG) have recently been solved at relatively high resolution Ê (1.4±1.5 A), and they displayed significantly less dispersed backbone conformational angles [20±22] than originally reported [23]. Therefore it is desirable to refine DNA structures (including A-DNA) at the highest resolution possible so that more reliable structural information can be obtained. In this paper, the A-DNA structure of the decamer d(AGGGGCCCCT) Ê Ê refined at 1.3 A resolution (although data to 1.1 A resolution were used) using anisotropic temperature factors is presented. The resulting structure affords a clear view of A-DNA close to atomic resolution and provides a basis of understanding for the structure of poly(dG)´poly(dC). M ATER I A L S A N D METH O D S The DNA d(AGGGGCCCCT) was synthesized at the Genetic Facility at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and purified by Sepharose S100 gel filtration column chromatography. Two crystal forms of A-DNA (Table 1) were obtained following the published procedures [24]. The crystallization solution was obtained by mixing 5 mm DNA duplex (2.5 mL), 100 mm sodium cacodylate buffer pH 6.5 (10 mL), 30%

2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (5 mL), plus varying amounts of the counter ions (2.5 mL) and was equilibrated with 40% 2-methyl2,4-pentanediol. The high-resolution crystal form in the space group of P212121 was obtained by adding 2.5 mL of 10 mm spermine solution to the crystallization dip. The P6122 crystal form was obtained by adding 2.5 mL of 25 mm Mg2+ or 2.5 mL of 10 mm [Co(NH3)6]3+ solutions to the crystallization dip. Diffraction data were collected at 2150 8C on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIc image plate system mounted on an RU-200 rotatingÊ anode X-ray generator using CuKa radiation (1.5418 A). After data processing using the biotex (v.1.1) software package from the Molecular Structure Corporation (Woodlands, TX, USA), each dataset produced a two- to fourfold redundancy in the observed reflections for both crystal forms (Table 1). For the P212121 form, the structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates from the spermineform of d(ACCCGCGGGT) [14] with the correct sequence of the molecule suitably incorporated. After initial refinement using the simulated annealing procedure in xplor [25], the

Ê R-factor reached <25% at 1.2 A resolution. Water molecules were then located from subsequent Fourier (2|Fo|-|Fc|) maps and added to the refinement. The refinement was continued using shelx97 [26] using all data. Anisotropic temperature factors were applied for all DNA atoms and hydrogen atoms at their idealized positions were included. The procedure of swat in shelx97 by Moews & Kretsinger [27] has been applied to model diffuse solvent. Water molecules were located by the procedure incorporated in shelx97 and they were refined with isotropic temperature factors. We were careful in the criteria of the inclusion of water molecules. Only first shell waters and well-defined higher shell waters were included. Forty-three water molecules were given half occupancies so that their temperature factors have reasonable values (below Ê B = 55 A2). No spermine ion could be located. One possible hydrated sodium ion was located in the major groove near the G14 base. Force-field parameters of Parkinson et al. [28] with modifications to allow sugar pucker to vary were used.

The final crystallographic R-factor for 13 095 reflections with Ê intensity greater than 2 s(I) to 1.1 A resolution was 19.7% (Table 1). The R-free was 23.6%. We believe that the final R-factor is not unusually high in comparison with earlier Ê A-DNA structures (refined at <1.7±1.9 A resolution) of R-factors in the range of <20%. In fact, the R-factors at Ê different resolution range for this structure, i.e. 18.6% at 1.2 A Ê (11 374 reflections), 17.6% at 1.3 A (9881 reflections), 16.4% Ê Ê at 1.4 A (8576 reflections), and 15.3% at 1.5 A (7473 reflections), indicate that the quality of the present structure is superior to any of the earlier A-DNA structures. For the P6122 structure, the initial attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement using the canonical decamer

A-DNA duplex were unsuccessful. However, the search using the octamer GGGGCCCC duplex as a search model was successful. While our work was in progress the structure of a related sequence AGGCATGCCT in a similar lattice of the P6122 space group was reported [15] and that structure confirmed our search result. The terminal A and T nucleotides do not form part of the duplex structure; instead they project away from the octamer duplex and form a base pair to each other using symmetry-related bases. The duplex is located on a crystallographic twofold axis, therefore only one strand of the decamer duplex is present in the asymmetric unit. After initial refinement using the simulated annealing procedure in xplor, Ê the R-factor reached <30% at 1.8 A resolution. Water molecules were then located from subsequent Fourier (2|Fo|-|Fc|) maps and added to the refinement. The refinement was continued using all Ê data to 1.5 A resolution. During the refinement, it was realized that the terminal T nucleotide adopts two different conformations so that it forms either a Watson±Crick or a reverse Watson±Crick base pair with a symmetry-related adenine base. The disordered conformations associated with the terminal A-T base pairs may be the cause of having an acceptable, but not excellent, refinement statistics. In the final model, only the Watson±Crick base pair was included. The final crystallographic R-factor was 23.6% using 2775 reflections [. 2 s(I)] to Ê 1.5 A resolution for the Mg2+ form. The Co(NH3)63+ form in the P6122 space group was similarly refined with the final crystallographic R-factor of 19.9% using 2250 reflections [. 2 s(I)] to Ê 1.76 A resolution. The locations of the Co(NH3)63+ ions were the same as those from the structure of Nunn and Neidle [15] and they are not discussed in detail here. The crystallographic data along with the refinement results are summarized in Table 1. Representative electron density maps of the P212121 form are shown in Fig. 1.

R E S U LT S AN D DI SCUSSI ON Global structure of two A-DNA duplexes The crystal structure of the (spermine) P212121 form of AGGGGCCCCT consists of a complete decamer A-DNA duplex (Figs 1A and 2A), whereas that of the P6122 form, with either Mg2+ or Co(NH3)63+ ions, consists of an eight basepair duplex with the A/T ends projecting away from the duplex core (Fig. 2B). Both duplex parts have similar global conformations, resembling the canonical A-DNA. The torsional angles and helix parameters for the P212121 structure are listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons were made by excluding the two terminal A-T base pairs. For the P212121 form, the averaged base pair inclination angle is 17.78 and all sugars have the N-type pucker (C3 H -endo) with the averaged pseudorotation angle of 158 (Table 2). Nevertheless, some small variations exist between the two crystal forms. The average rise per residue values in the Ê Ê P212121 and P6122 forms are 2.45 A and 2.81 A, respectively, whereas the x-displacements for the two respective crystal forms Ê Ê are 25.03 A and 24.90 A. Because the entire helix is in the asymmetric unit in the P212121 form, there are nine unique dinucleotide steps whose helical twist angle (V) values range from 25.28 (of the G4pG5 step) to 39.48 (of the G3pG4 step), with an average value of 31.88. But its global conformation remains close to the canonical A-DNA. Therefore the DNA backbone makes appropriate adjustments for the variable local conformations to achieve a similar global conformation. The structures of AGGGGCCCCT and the related ACCGGCCGGT [14] in the P212121 form have an rmsd of Ê 0.856 A (using common atoms) between them. The structures of AGGGGCCCCT and the related d(AGGCATGCCT) [15] in the Ê P6122 form have an rmsd of 0.787 A (using common atoms) between them. However, the same AGGGGCCCCT has an rmsd Ê of 1.56 A (using central eight base pairs) between the P212121 form and the P6122 forms. The main difference appears to be localized near the 5 H -end (G2 to G5) which is related to the lattice interactions between DNA duplexes. The results affirm the previous observations that molecules crystallized in the same space group have a more similar conformation, whereas the

same molecule crystallized in different space groups has different (local) conformations [14]. High-resolution structure of an A-DNA decamer The structure of the P212121 form has been refined with Ê anisotropic temperature factors at better than 1.2 A resolution which affords an excellent view of A-DNA. Figure 3 shows a portion of the decamer A-DNA duplex with anisotropic thermal ellipsoids for all individual atoms. It adopts the A-DNA with the characteristic wide and shallow minor groove, and the narrow and deep major groove. Interestingly, the temperature factors are smallest for the bases, medium for the sugars and largest for the phosphate groups. The longitudinal direction of the thermal ellipsoids of the phosphate oxygen atoms is generally parallel to the O3 H -P-O5 H plane, suggesting that the motion of the phosphate group has a twisting mode at the phosphorous atom relative to the O3 H -P-O5 H bond. The G-C base pair geometry in the A-DNA decamer structure was examined. The hydrogen bond distances of G-O6:C-N4, G-N1:C-N3 and G-N2:C-O2 averaged from eight G-C base pairs Ê Ê Ê are 2.87 A (range 2.74±2.99 A), 2.90 A (range 2.85±2.94) and Ê Ê 2.83 A (range 2.69±2.93 A), respectively. These values are Ê similar to the respective values of 2.91, 2.95 and 2.86 A

observed in the small dinucleotide r(GpC) [29] or those Ê observed (2.86, 2.93 and 2.89 A) in Z-DNA [30]. It appears that the G-C base pair hydrogen bonding geometry, on average, is not significantly affected in different DNA conformational contexts. Inspection of the packing interactions of the A-DNA duplex of the P212121 form shows that A-DNA molecules form crystal lattices by abutting their terminal base pairs onto the shallow and wide minor groove of other A-DNA duplexes as noted previously in other A-DNA structures [7]. In the P212121 lattice, two symmetry-related terminal base pairs, A1*-T20* and A11*-T10*, `stack' over the backbone near the C7-C8 and the C18-C19 sequences, respectively (Fig. 4). Three interhelix hydrogen bonds are found between the A10*-T11* base pair and the reference duplex (Fig. 4A), whereas only one is found for the A1*-T20* base pair (Fig. 4B). Therefore the asymmetric interactions of the decamer duplex with the neighboring duplexes produce a more asymmetric helix in the P212121 lattice. In contrast, the terminal A1 and T10 nucleotides of the P6122 form of d(ACCGGCCGGT) are not part of the helix; instead they project away from the duplex. A1 is paired with T10* from a symmetry-related molecule, forming an A-T base pair which appears to adopt a disordered conformation (either a Watson± Crick base pair or a reversed Watson±Crick base pair). The A-T base pair is sandwiched between neighboring (GGGGCCCC)2 duplexes (Fig. 4C). Hydration structure in A-DNA The formation of A-DNA is influenced by several factors. It can be induced by low water activity. For example, alcohol facilitates the transition of B-DNA to A-DNA. In the A-DNA decamer crystals, we note that nearly the entire surface of the

wide minor groove is occupied by terminal base pairs from other symmetry-related duplexes. Essentially the hydration shell in the minor groove of the decamer A-DNA duplex is completely displaced by the hydrophobic surface of neighboring terminal base pairs. In other words, the A-DNA duplexes in the crystal lattice are embedded in a hydrophobic environment, created by the terminal base pairs from other duplexes as seen in Fig. 4. This is consistent with the fact that A-DNA is favored in an environment of low water activity. In contrast, the deep major groove is filled with ordered water molecules (Fig. 5A). Each G-C base pair is associated with four to five water molecules bridging the base pair, exemplified by the electron density map of Fig. 1B. Each guanine base has 2±3 water molecules hydrogen bonded to the N7 and O6 atoms. Each cytosine base has one water hydrogen bonded directly to the N4 amino group, which is in turn hydrogen bonded to another bridging water bound to a phosphate group. Such a hydration structure appear to be a common motif for a G : C base pair in the major groove of A-DNA. Those water molecules form a sheath of hydration layer, often involving a pentagonal network as shown in Fig. 5B. The hydration structure in the major groove of this decamer A-DNA is schematically shown in Fig. 6. It should be noted that part of this water network can be displaced by bound metal ions (e.g. [Co(NH3)6]3+ ions; reviewed in Gao et al. [14]). In fact, a possible hydrated sodium ion was found near the G14 base (Fig. 6). The sugar-phosphate backbone is linked between phosphate groups with a string of water molecules. Our observation is similar to those found in other A-DNA crystal structures which have been reviewed recently [31].

A model for the A-DNA structure of poly(dG)´poly(dC) The d(AGGGGCCCCT) decamer contains an uninterrupted stretch of (G)n´(C)n core sequence. Therefore the high-resolution structure of d(AGGGGCCCCT) affords an opportunity to understand the structure of poly(dG)´poly(dC) which is known to have a strong propensity to adopt the A-DNA conformation [32]. It has been noted previously that the GpG dinucleotide step has a characteristic stacking interaction which may favor the A-DNA conformation [8,32]. We have compared all GpG steps of the A-DNA structures available in the Nucleic Acids Database, which may be grouped into two categories depending on the a/g combination (Fig. 7A,B). In the first category with the a(gauche2)/g(gauche+) combination, the G over G stacking appears to have a range of slides in the Dy/Dx direction. In the second category with the a(trans)/g(trans) combination, the pattern for the G over G stacking appears to be more uniform. Further analysis of the stacking patterns indicates that the GpG steps with the a(trans)/g(trans) combination are generally associated with low helical twist angles (average 27.48). In contrast, the GpG steps with the a(gauche2)/g(gauche+) combinations are associated with a more variable helical twist angles (average 32.58; range 27.08 to 39.48). It should be pointed out that the correlation between the a(trans)/g(trans) combination and a low helical twist angle is not restricted to a GpG step, as it was first pointed out with the central CpG step in the CCCCGGGG A-DNA structure [9]. It is interesting to note that there is a clear correlation between the a and g torsional angles as shown in Fig. 7C. The most probable values for the two clusters are a(2758)/g(608) (denoted AI conformation) and a(1408)/g(1808) (denoted AII conformation), respectively. Those values are in agreement with those from the earlier analysis using all dinucleotide steps in A-DNA conformation [19]. Thus, it appears that different DNA conformations (A, B and Z) adopt unique mechanisms to adjust the backbone conformation in order to manifest the helical twist angles associated with various nucleotide steps. In A-DNA, two a/g combinations (AI and AII conformations) are used. In B-DNA, two (a-z) values are used for the BI (<2908) and BII (<+ 908)

conformations [33]. And finally in Z-DNA, two combinations of several torsional angles in the GpC step are found for the ZI and ZII conformations [34]. The average values of the backbone torsional angles derived from the decamer structure are remarkably close to the mean values (Table 2) obtained from the torsional distribution of all A-DNA structures surveyed up to 1996 with diffraction Ê resolution better than 1.9 A [19]. It is worthwhile to emphasize that those averaged values of the A-DNA backbone torsional angles should be useful in serving as reference values for the refinement of A-DNA structures of medium resolution (e.g.

Ê <2 A) in the future. If the refined torsional angles deviate significantly from the averaged values cited here, the refined structures should be inspected carefully to insure that outliers are reliable. When we compare those average values with those of fiber models (Table 2), only small differences between them were noted. Therefore those average values are not peculiar only to A-DNA of (G)n´(C)n sequence; rather, they are general properties of the canonical A-DNA structure. The representative conformational parameters listed in Table 2 were used to construct a model for the poly(dG)´poly(dC) duplex (not shown). While the model is similar to the fiber A-DNA model, there are visible differences between them. These differences, e.g. in groove width, are mainly due to the variability associated with the A-DNA backbone conformation. Interactions of counter ions with A-DNA By changing the choice of metal ions, d(AGGGGCCCCT) is induced into two different crystal lattices. Mg2+ and [Co(NH3)6]3+ ions produced the hexagonal form; whereas the spermine ion produced the orthorhombic form. In the orthorhombic P212121 form of d(AGGGGCCCCT) A-DNA crystals, only spermine was used as the major counter ion (except the sodium cacodylate buffer). However, no spermine molecule could be located unambiguously, despite the high resolution of the structure. This is in contrast to an earlier A-DNA structure [35] in which an extended spermine was found to bind only to phosphate groups. In the P6122 form obtained with [Co(NH3)6]3+ ions, two [Co(NH3)6]3+ ions were found. One bridges the phosphate groups. The other is located near the G2-G3-G4 bases and is bound to the edges of two adjacent intrastranded guanines through hydrogen bonds to the N7 and O6 sites of guanines. This binding mode (i.e. [Co(NH3)6]3+ ions binding at the GpG sites) has been observed earlier in X-ray crystallographic [14,36], NMR [37,38] and theoretical [39] studies and its importance in DNA conformational conversions (e.g. B- to A-DNA or B- to Z-DNA) has been discussed [37,38,40]. C O N CLU SI O N In this paper we have analyzed A-DNA structures of a DNA decamer d(AGGGGCCCCT), containing a string of G's (and C's), in two crystal lattices. Reliable backbone torsional angles of A-DNA are obtained from the near atomic resolution decamer structure of the P212121 form. We showed that while the overall conformations of both structures remain close to canonical A-DNA, the local structure is influenced by the crystal packing environments. For example, the six independent GpG steps in these two structures have different base-base stacking patterns, with their helical twist angles (V) ranging from 26.28 to 38.78. These variable local conformations are due primarily to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the terminal base pairs of one helix and the base pairs from another helix. This type of interhelix base-base interaction, which may be considered as a special kind of base pair (e.g. base triple), is ubiquitous in A-DNA crystals. Such observations of local conformational variability are relevant in understanding the possible function of A-DNA or RNA. A-DNA and RNA are considered to be less flexible than B-DNA. The fact that the A-DNA conformation can be modified to some extent by crystal packing interactions suggests that proteins can modulate the conformation of A-DNA/RNA to achieve optimum recognition. This has been demonstrated in the recent crystal structures of the TBP/TATA-box complex [2,3]

and Sac7d/Sso7d-DNA complexes [4,5]. Finally the stacking interactions of the GpG step, which is conducive for A-DNA, has been analyzed and two distinct patterns associated with two a/g torsional angle combinations were identified.
