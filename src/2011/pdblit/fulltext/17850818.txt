Oxidative biodegradation of aromatic compounds by bacteria usually begins with hydroxylation of the aromatic ring by multi-component dioxygenases like benzene dioxygenase, biphenyl dioxygenase, and others. These enzymes are composed of ferredoxin reductase, ferredoxin, and terminal oxygenase. Reducing equivalents that originate from NADH are transferred from ferredoxin reductase to ferredoxin and, in turn, to the terminal oxygenase, thus resulting in the activation of a dioxygen. BphA4 is the ferredoxin reductase component of biphenyl dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. strain KKS102. The amino acid sequence of BphA4 exhibits signi®cant homology with the putidaredoxin reductase of the cytochrome P450cam system in Pseudomonas putida, as well as with various other oxygenase-coupled NADH-dependent ferredoxin reductases (ONFRs) of bacteria. To date, no structural information has been provided for the ferredoxin reductase component of the dioxygenase systems. In order to provide a structural basis for discussing the mechanism of electron transport between ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin, crystal structures of BphA4 and its NADH complex were solved. The threedimensional structure of BphA4 is different from those of ferredoxin reductases whose structures have already been determined, but adopts essentially the same fold as the enzymes of the glutathione reductase (GR) family. Also the three-dimensional structure of the ®rst two domains of BphA4 adopts a fold similar to that of adrenodoxin reductase (AdR) in the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 system. Comparing the amino acid sequence with what is known of the three-dimensional structure of BphA4 strongly suggests that the other ONFRs have secondary structural features that are similar to that of BphA4. This analysis of the crystal structures of BphA4 suggests that Lys53 and Glu159 seem to be involved in the hydride transfer from NADH to FAD. Since the amino acid residues around the active site, some of which seem to be important to electron transport, are highly conserved among ONFRs, it is likely that the mechanism of electron transport of BphA4 is quite applicable to other ONFRs.

Introduction
In bacteria, hydrocarbons like camphor, n-alkanes, and benzene/biphenyls are respectively oxidized (or hydroxylated) by the following enzymatic systems; the cytochrome P450cam system, the alkane hydroxylase system, and the benzene/ biphenyl dioxygenase system (Harayama et al., 1992). Although their catalytic reactions and substrates are distinct from each other, these systems

398 have several common features: (1) these enzymes are composed of a terminal oxygenase and an electron transport system; (2) the active site in the terminal oxygenase contains an Fe ion that is essential for their reaction; (3) electrons originating from NADH are transported by an electron-transport system to the active site; and (4) the electrons are required to activate a dioxygen at the active site. The electron transport system of these oxygenases (or hydroxylases) usually has two components; namely, an oxygenase-coupled NADH-dependent ferredoxin reductase (ONFR) and an iron-sulfur protein, the latter of which is designated as ferredoxin in many cases. The electron transport is initiated by a single two-electron transfer from NADH to FAD in ONFR, which generates a fully reduced form of FAD. The reduced FAD provides one electron each to the iron-sulfur cluster, in most cases [2Fe-2S] cluster, of two iron-sulfur proteins. These electrons are ®nally transferred to the terminal oxygenase. The iron-sulfur protein of the electron-transport system is a relatively small protein, usually less than 20 kDa (Harayama et al., 1992; Mason & Commack, 1992). Each oxygenase system has a distinct iron-sulfur protein; the amino acid sequences of these iron-sulfur proteins exhibit no similarity to one another (Tanaka et al., 1974; Kok et al., 1989; Fukuda et al., 1994), suggesting that there exists no evolutionary relationship among them. In contrast, ONFRs exhibit signi®cantly similar amino acid sequences, suggesting that they have an evolutionary relationship. Recently a homolog of bacterial ONFRs has been found in human mitochondria (Susin et al., 1999). Susin et al. suggested that the protein, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), is likely to be a bifunctional protein with an electron acceptor/donor function and an apoptogenic function. This ®nding suggests that ONFRs seem to exist in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to human beings, and play a role in obtaining reducing equivalents from NADH. Since the electron transport system plays an essential role in the catalysis of the oxygenase systems, much attention has been focused on the mechanism of electron transport. To date, the structure-function relationship of the iron-sulfur proteins (or ferredoxins) has been extensively studied. In contrast, very little is known about the structure-function relationship of ONFRs. Biochemical studies have revealed that ONFR is a ¯avoprotein with ca 400 amino acid residues, and which shows absorption spectra typical of FAD with maxima at around 375 nm and 450 nm. These studies also show ONFR to contain two binding sites for ADP moieties, one in FAD and the other in NAD (Harayama et al., 1992; Mason & Commack et al., 1992). The detailed mechanism of the electron transport from NADH to the iron-sulfur protein, however, remains unresolved because the three-dimensional structure of ONFRs is unknown. In order to obtain information on the three-dimensional structure of ONFRs and to

Crystal Structure of Ferredoxin Reductase

guide further studies that aim at understanding the electron transport mechanism, we have determined the crystal structure of one of the ONFRs, which is found in the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) degradation pathway of Pseudomonas sp. strain KKS102. Pseudomonas sp. strain KKS102 was isolated as a PCB-degrading bacterium (Kimbara et al., 1989) and intensively studied with the intention of utilizing the bacterium in the bioremediation of PCBs in the environment (Kikuchi et al., 1994a,b, Fukuda et al., 1994). The degradation of PCBs by Pseudomonas sp. strain KKS102 begins with oxidation by the benzene/biphenyl dioxygenase system. In this system, terminal oxygenase, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin reductase are designated as BphA1A2, BphA3, and BphA4, respectively. Here we report the crystal structure of an oxygenase-coupled NADH-dependent ferredoxin reductase (ONFR), BphA4. This is the ®rst threedimensional structure to be determined for a bacterial ONFR. The overall fold of BphA4 is essentially the same as those of the glutathione reductase family enzymes, which strongly suggests an evolutionary relationship between them. In addition to this, the crystal structure of BphA4 in complex with NADH (BphA4:NADH complex) has also been determined. A detailed analysis of ONFR sequences combined with the present crystal structure has revealed that the active site seems to be well conserved among ONFRs. This ®nding strongly suggests that ONFRs have a common mechanism for transferring electrons from NADH to the [2Fe2S] cluster of ferredoxin. The evolutionary relationship between BphA4 and the glutathione reductase family enzymes (disul®de oxidoreductases) as well as AIF will also be discussed.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination The crystal structure of BphA4 was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method (Table 1). While interpreting the electron density map, many discrepancies were found between the previously reported amino acid sequence (Kikuchi et al., 1994a) and the amino acid sequence as deduced from the MIR electron density map. Since the electron density map was of good quality (Figure 1(a)), it was highly likely that the previously reported amino acid sequence contained several mistakes. The DNA sequence of bphA4 was redone (see Materials and Methods) and the model of BphA4 was completed using the revised amino acid sequence (Figure 2). The crystal structure, which consists of residues 5 to 405, one FAD molecule, and 120 water molecules, has been Ê re®ned at 2.1 A resolution, resulting in an R-factor of 18.4 % (Table 2).

Overall structure The overall structure of BphA4 (Figure 1(b)) is completely different from that of ferredoxin reductases derived from spinach and cyanobacterium (Karplus et al., 1991; Serre et al., 1996) and from their family proteins such as ¯avodoxin reductase (Ingelman et al., 1997), cytochrome b5 reductase (Nishida et al., 1995), the FAD-containing fragment of NADH-dependent nitrate reductase (Lu et al., 1994), phthalate dioxygenase reductase (Correll et al., 1992), and NADH-cytochrome P450 reductase (Wang et al., 1997). Instead, the overall structure of BphA4 adopts essentially the same fold as glutathione reductase (GR) (Shulz et al., 1978; Karplus & Schulz, 1989) and its related disul®de oxidoreductases (GR-family enzymes) (Schierbeek et al., 1989; Schiering et al., 1991; Mattevi et al., 1992; Chen et al., 1994; Lantwin et al., 1994) as proposed by Eggink et al. (1990). Superposition of BphA4 with GR-family enzymes gives a Ê root-mean-square (rms) deviation of ca 2 A (Table 3).

Recently the crystal structure of bovine adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), an oxygenase-coupled NADPH-dependent ferredoxin reductase, has been determined (Ziegler et al., 1999). Interestingly, it has revealed that AdR has a fold similar to that of the GR-family enzymes. BphA4 is another example of ONFR that has a GR-like fold. In bacteria, this is the ®rst structure of ONFR with a GR-like fold. According to the de®nition of the domains of GR (Schulz et al., 1978), BphA4 can be divided into three domains: an FAD-binding domain (1-111 and 238-317), an NADH-binding domain (112-237), and a C-terminal domain (318-408) (Figure 1(b)). The C-terminal domain of BphA4 corresponds to the interface domain of GR. Since GR-family enzymes adopt similar ternary and quaternary structures, in the present manuscript, the crystal structure of GR from Escherichia coli (the PDB codes of 1ger (Mittl & Schulz, 1994) and 1get (Mittl et al., 1994) for the native and NADP complex, respectively) is used as a representative structure of the GR-family enzymes. Despite the similarity, the overall structures of BphA4 and GR differ in certain respects. First, GR from E. coli has two long a-helices between residues 42 and 106 (65 residues in all). In contrast, the corresponding region of BphA4, namely residues

48 to 72 (25 residues in all), adopts mainly an extended conformation. Second, the relative disposition of the three domains is slightly different between BphA4 and other GR-family enzymes. When compared with BphA4, the NADH-binding and C-terminal domains of GR (and other GRÊ family enzymes) exhibit a ca 2 A shift toward the FAD-binding domain. The direction of the shift is nearly perpendicular to the b-strands of the shifting domains. In addition to these differences, the dimerization mode also seems to be different between BphA4 and GR. Quaternary structure Gel ®ltration analysis of BphA4 has shown that BphA4 forms a dimer in solution (data not shown),

as do the GR-family enzymes. Since the asymmetric unit contains only one BphA4 molecule, the crystal packing was analyzed to ®nd the dimer form. It was found that there are two probable dimer forms in the crystal. The buried-surface areas between the subunits of the two dimer forms Ê Ê (1064 A2 and 976 A2), however, are relatively small and comparable to each other. Thus, the most probable dimer form cannot be determined. It should be noted that none of the probable dimer forms in the crystal resembles the dimer form of GR. Structure comparison between BphA4 and AdR The chain folds of FAD and ``NADP'' domains in AdR (Ziegler et al., 1999) exhibit a signi®cant

core part of each domain is well superposed (Figure 3(a) and (b)) with rms deviation of less than Ê 2 A (Table 4). In addition, amino acid sequences of the matched polypeptide segments exhibit slight similarities between BphA4 and AdR (Table 4).

The residue numbers are labeled for the polypeptide chain of BphA4. The superposition of the FAD(-binding) domains of the three is shown in (a). The FAD molecules are also shown. In this orientation, the NADH-binding domain of BphA4 (magenta) and ``NADP'' domain of AdR (cyan) are not well superposed due to the different domain arrangement between BphA4 and AdR. The NADH-binding domain of GR is not shown in (a). Despite difference in domain arrangement, the core part of the NADH-binding domain of BphA4 and NADP domain of AdR can be well superposed as shown in (b). These Figures were prepared by the program MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

It is intriguing to note that there is a difference in domain composition between BphA4 and AdR. BphA4 is composed of three domains, while AdR is composed of only two domains; AdR lacks the counter part of the C-terminal domain of BphA4. It should be noted that the domain composition of AdR is the same as that of thioredoxin reductase (TR) (Kuriyan et al., 1991). In addition, Ziegler et al. (1999) have shown that, among the structures in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000), the fold of each domain of AdR exhibits the best ®t

with the corresponding domain of TR. On the other hand, the domain composition and the fold in each domain of BphA4 are essentially the same as those of GR. These facts suggest that BphA4 and AdR seem to be closely related to GR and TR, respectively (Ziegler et al., 1999), and the relationship between BphA4 and AdR seems to be distant. Although there seems to be at least two types in ONFRs, GR and TR types, hereafter, the term ONFR will be used only for the GR type in this work.

403 pocket, which is lined by Arg48, Leu51, Ser52, Leu129, Ile156, and Arg130 (Figure 4(a)). In the two Arg residues, only the aliphatic portions of the side-chains contribute to forming the pocket. Pro49 interacts like a backstop with the isoalloxazine ring from the si side. A restrained conformation of Pro49 seems to be important in positioning the isoalloxazine ring. In contrast to the xylene moiety, the pteridine moiety of the isoalloxazine ring interacts with polar residues, some of which form hydrogen bonds with protein atoms and water molecules (Figure 4(a)). Hereafter the distance between the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor will be give in parentheses. The O2 atom of the isoalloxazine ring forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the mainÊ chain amide nitrogen atom of Trp291 (3.0 A) and a Ê ). The O4 atom of the isoalwater molecule (2.8 A loxazine ring forms a hydrogen bond with the NZ Ê atom of Lys53 (2.7 A), which in turn makes a salt e Ê bridge with the O atom of Glu159 (2.7 A). The hydrogen bond network between Lys53, Glu159 and FAD is conserved among several GR-family enzymes including GR, trypanothione reductase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Karplus & Schulz, 1989; Lantwin et al., 1994; Mattevi et al., 1992). In addition to the hydrogen bonds described above, the pteridine moiety makes a van der Waals interaction with the side-chain of Trp320, which is located on the si side of the isoalloxazine ring (Figure 4(a)). The interplanar angle between the isoalloxazine ring and the indole ring of Trp320 is ca 50  . The interaction between the protein and the isoalloxazine ring is extensive on the si side. In contrast, there are fewer interactions on the re side. A large cavity with dimensions of ca Ê Ê Ê 6 AÂ 8 A Â 10 A is found in front of the pteridine moiety of the isoalloxazine ring. The crystal structure of the BphA4:NADH complex has revealed that the cavity accommodates the nicotinamide ring of NADH. Structure determination of the BphA4:NADH complex In order to gain insight into the interaction between BphA4 and NADH, the crystal structure of the BphA4:NADH complex was solved. Crystals of the BphA4:NADH complex were prepared by the soaking method. When preparing the BphA4:NADH complex crystals in an anaerobic chamber, all of the crystals were cracked after the addition of NADH, probably due to the conformational shifts that occurred upon binding NADH (see Conformational shifts upon NADH binding, below). The BphA4:NADH complex crystals in partially reduced form were prepared by the soaking method under aerobic conditions. Some crystals were reduced without serious damage. The reduction of crystals was demonstrated visually by a change from yellow to colorless. During the process of crystal mounting, which was carried out under

Conformation of FAD The FAD molecule binds to BphA4 in an extended manner similar to that observed in GR (Mittl & Schulz, 1994). The conformation of FAD in BphA4, however, is slightly different from that of GR. The major difference occurs in the torsion angle de®ned by C2H -C1H -N10-C10, which is À95.4  and À85.4  in BphA4 and GR, respectively. This difference results in signi®cantly different dispositions of the isoalloxazine rings. The superposition of equivalent atoms except for the isoalloxazine rings in both of the FAD molecules shows that these two structures are very similar with an Ê rms deviation of 0.32 A. The similarity between the FAD conformations (excluding the isoalloxazine ring) seems to arise from the FAD-binding crevice that is well conserved between BphA4 and GR (see below). Interaction between FAD and protein atoms The adenine ring, ribose, and the pyrophosphate group of FAD tightly bind to the crevice on the FAD-binding domain through intensive hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions (Figure 4(a)). In addition to the direct interactions, polar groups of FAD form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which in turn form hydrogen bonds with protein atoms. The amino acid residues that make the van der Waals interaction with FAD (Gly14, Gly16, Ala108, Thr109, Gly272 and Ala294), most of which are located at the bottom of the crevice, are highly conserved between BphA4 and GR (and GR-family enzymes), despite the low overall amino acid sequence identity between them (16.9 %) (Figure 4(a)). In contrast, the amino acid residues forming hydrogen bonds with FAD are relatively less conserved. The isoalloxazine ring of FAD is located in the central part of the BphA4 molecule, as is that observed in GR, and is completely buried inside the molecule (Figure 1(b)). The xylene moiety of the isoalloxazine ring is located in a hydrophobic

aerobic condition, the crystal seemed to become slightly re-oxidized, as evidenced by the color of the crystal turning light yellow. Thus the exact oxidation state of BphA4 in the crystal is unclear. Although NADH may be converted to NAD as a result of a reduction of FAD in the crystal, in this manuscript, the term ``NADH'' is used for the bound NADH (or NAD). The crystal of the BphA4:NADH complex was inferior to the native form of the crystal in its ability to diffract, probably due to the damage

incurred upon soaking (Table 2). Since the lattice constants changed signi®cantly under cryogenic conditions, the crystal structure of the BphA4:NADH complex was determined by the molecular replacement method. A difference Fourier map exhibited the electron density for the bound NADH. Although the electron density was relatively weak, NADH could be ®tted into the density without much dif®culty (Figure 5). The average B-factors for the AMP and the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) moieties of NADH are

Ê Ê 41.2 A2 and 62.2 A2, respectively, whereas the Ê average B-factor for all atoms is 34.0 A2. The relatively high temperature factor and the weak electron density of bound NADH may re¯ect a partial occupancy of NADH in the crystal. The crystal Ê structure has been re®ned at 2.6 A resolution (Table 2). The overall structure of the BphA4:NADH complex is nearly the same as that of the NADH-free form, except for the residues around FAD and NADH. The rms deviation among all of the Ca atom pairs of NADH-free and complex forms is Ê 0.34 A, which is marginally smaller than the Ê estimated coordinates error (0.41 A) of the BphA4:NADH complex derived from a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952). Conformational shifts upon NADH binding The nicotinamide ring and the nicotinamide ribose (N-ribose) of NADH are accommodated in the cavity located in front of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (Figure 4(b)), inducing some conformational shifts of the surrounding residues. Of the amino acid residues exhibiting conformational shifts, residues Val155 and Ile156 exhibit the largest shifts Ê (Figure 6). Ile156 is moved ca 1.5 A away from the nicotinamide ring as a result of a steric con¯ict between the Cg1 and Cd atoms of Ile156 and the nicotinamide ring (the C5 and C6 atoms). Accompanying these conformational shifts, the neighborÊ ing residue Val155 is also shifted by ca 0.8 A. The conformational shifts of these residues were con®rmed using a simulated annealing omit map (SA-omit map) (Hodel et al., 1992) for Val155, Ile156 and NADH, and ten independent crystallographic re®nement calculations (data not shown). The conformation of FAD also undergoes a slight change upon NADH binding. The dimethyl-

containing edge of the isoalloxazine ring tilts away Ê from the nicotinamide ring by ca 0.4 A due to the steric con¯ict. As a result, Pro49 and Pro50 are disÊ placed ca 0.4 A away from the isoalloxazine ring. The displacements of Pro49 and Pro50, then, accompany a shift of helix a2 that immediately follows Pro50. Although the observed conformational shifts are nearly the same as the estimated coordiÊ nate errors derived from the Luzzati plots (0.31 A Ê and 0.41 A for native and NADH complex forms, respectively), the results of ten independent crystallographic re®nements exhibited nearly the same conformational shifts. Furthermore, a series of SAomit maps (Hodel et al., 1992) were calculated to give validity to the conformational shifts of these residues (data not shown). It should be noted that the shifted residues on the si side of the isoalloxazine ring are located in the interface of the adjacent molecule in the crystal lattice. These conformational shifts upon NADH binding are likely to cause the crystal lattice to break. Conformation of bound NADH The NADH molecule binds to BphA4 in an extended manner (Figure 4(b)). The conformation of bound NADH is slightly different from that of NADPH in GR (Mittl et al., 1994). First, the relative disposition of the AMP and NMN moieties of NAD(P)H is different between the two (Figure 7). Second, the w-angle and the puckering mode of the ribose ring of the NMN moiety exhibit signi®cant differences, with the w-angles of BphA4 and GR being 166  and À166  , respectively, and the puckering mode of the ribose rings of BphA4 and GR being C2H -endo and C3H -endo, respectively.

Figure 7. Structural comparison of FAD and NADH in BphA4 and GR. Lys53 and Glu159 of BphA4 as well as Lys50 and Glu181 of GR (1get) are also shown (stereo view). The atoms of BphA4 and GR are superimposed using the equivalent atoms of the isoalloxazine and the nicotinamide rings. The BphA4 and GR are colored red and blue, respectively. This Figure was prepared by the program MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

trast, the structures of the ADP moieties, which tightly bind to the NADH-binding domain (see below), are approximately the same except for the different puckering modes of the ribose rings, which are C2H -endo and C3H -endo for BphA4 and GR, respectively. The rms deviation between equivalent atoms of the ADP moieties, except in Ê Ê the ribose ring, is 0.21 A (0.57 A when including all atoms in the ADP moieties). It should be noted that there are some ambiguities in the puckering mode of ribose in NADH due to the insuf®cient Ê resolution (2.6 A) of the present structure. A detailed analysis should be done in order to obtain the precise conformational parameters for bound NADH. Interaction between BphA4 and NADH The ADP moiety of NADH binds to the crevice on the NADH-binding domain. The amino acid residues that line the surface of the crevice (Val151, Gly154, Ile156 and Gly236) are highly conserved among ONFRs and GR-family enzymes (Figure 4(b)). The nicotinamide ring, which is sandwiched by the isoalloxazine ring and the side-chain of Val155, is placed nearly parallel with the isoalloxazine ring Ê at a distance of ca 3.5 A (Figure 4(b) and (c)). The C4 atom of nicotinamide is located at a distance of Ê 3.4 A from the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring. In addition to the van der Waals contacts, the nicotinamide ring is ®xed through two hydrogen bonds. The N7 atom of the nicotinamide ring forms hydrogen bonds with the Oe atom of Glu159 Ê (2.6 A) and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom Ê of Trp320 (3.0 A) (Figure 4(c)). It is intriguing to note that the relative dispositions of the nicotinamide and isoalloxazine rings are virtually the same as those observed in the GRfamily enzymes (Figure 7) (Karplus & Schulz, 1989; Lantwin et al., 1994; Mittl et al., 1994). The superposition of the nicotinamide and isoalloxazine rings of BphA4 with those of GR (E. coli) gives an rms Ê deviation of 0.24 A, while the remaining parts of FAD and NAD(P)H exhibit signi®cant positional differences in the superimposed structure

(Figure 7). Clearly the differences arise from the different relative dispositions of the FAD and NADH-binding domains between BphA4 and GR (see Overall structure, above). The ¯exible nature of the FAD and NADH molecules seems to allow a similar disposition of the isoalloxazine and nicotinamide rings between BphA4 and GR. This disposition appears to be suitable for the hydride transfer from NADH to FAD. Recently, the crystal structures of the productive complexes of pea ferredoxin reductase (FNR) have been reported (Deng et al., 1999). The structures reveal a unique NADP binding mode in which the nicotinamide ring is not parallel with the isoalloxazine ring but lies at an angle of ca 30  , where Ê the C4 atom is located at a distance of 3 A from the ¯avin N5 atom. Since there is ambiguity in the oxidation state of BphA4 in the present crystal, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed parallel con®guration of the two rings may be an artifact. To clarify this point, the crystal structure of the BphA4:NADH complex in its fully reduced state should be determined. Possible role of residues around the active site The reaction of BphA4 can be subdivided into two half-reactions, a reductive half-reaction and an oxidative half-reaction. Although the oxidative half-reaction of BphA4 is different from that of GRfamily enzymes, the reductive half-reaction, a hydride transfer from NAD(P)H to FAD, is not different from that of GR-family enzymes. Since the relative dispositions of the nicotinamide and isoalloxazine rings are nearly the same between BphA4 and GR, it is reasonable to assume that the conserved residues around the isoalloxazine ring are involved in the hydride transfer. A comparison of the active-site structures between BphA4 and the GR-family enzymes reveals that only Lys53, Glu159 and Ile156 are invariant residues between them (Figures 4(c) and 6). Of these three residues, Ile156 seems to have no functional signi®cance due to its electrostatically inactive nature. In contrast, Glu159 and Lys53, which are disposed above the nicotinamide and

407 AIF shows that all of the insertions and deletions found in the sequence of AIF occur in the loop regions of BphA4 (Figure 2). Second, the binding motifs for NADH and FAD are well conserved between AIF and BphA4. In addition, residues Pro49, Lys53, Glu159 and Trp320, which seem to be important in the electron transport activity of BphA4, are also conserved in AIF (Figure 2). This fact strongly suggests that AIF could function as an electron transport component like BphA4. These substantial similarities between BphA4 and AIF suggest an evolutionary relationship between them; AIF seems to have evolved from bacterial ONFR. Since AIF is a mitochondrial protein, it might have evolved from ONFR in the aerobic bacteria that had formed a synbiotic relationship with a primordial anaerobic eukaryote. Evolutionary relationship between BphA4 and GR-family enzymes The sequence identities of BphA4 with GR (E. coli), trypanothione reductase (Crithidia fasciculata) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Pseudomonas putida) are 16.9 %, 18.6 % and 18.6 %, respectively. Despite the low amino acid sequence identity between BphA4 and the GR-family enzymes, the overall structural similarity between BphA4 and the GR-family enzymes (Figure 4 and Table 3) suggests that these proteins have evolved from a common ancestor. In the course of their evolution, they seem to have acquired distinct functions by modulating their structures as follows. First, the amino acid residues in the active site exhibit divergence, except for the residues required for hydride transfer. The most striking difference between them exists on the si side of the isoalloxazine ring. BphA4 and ONFRs completely lack the Cys residues that are essential for the catalysis of GR-family enzymes. It has been proven that the Cys residues are reduced by FAD in GR-family enzymes. The reduced cysteine, if present in the BphA4-BphA3 complex, may cause a nucleophilic reaction, thus preventing the ¯ow of an electron from BphA4 to BphA3. Thus, it is reasonable that BphA4 and ONFRs have lost (or GR-family enzymes have acquired) the Cys residues in the course of their evolution. Second, BphA4 and GR-family enzymes exhibit different modes of dimerization. Although the exact dimer form of BphA4 remains unknown, none of the probable dimer forms in the crystals of BphA4 resembles that found in the GR-family enzymes (see Quaternary structure). In the case of GR-family enzymes, the concave molecular surface of the si side of the ¯avin has been shown to be the interface for another subunit (Shulz et al., 1978; Schierbeek et al., 1989; Mattevi et al., 1992; Lantwin et al., 1994). The dimer formation is essential for the activity of GR-family enzymes, as the substrate-binding site spans both subunits (Shulz et al., 1978; Pai &

isoalloxazine rings, respectively (Figure 4(c)), seem to provide a suitable electrostatic environment for the hydride transfer from NADH to FAD. Furthermore, Lys53 and Glu159 are also invariant among ONFRs (Figure 2). These facts suggest that Lys53 and Glu159 are likely to have functional signi®cance in the hydride transfer. It should be noted that, in GR, corresponding residues have been proposed to have some effect on the hydride transfer (Karplus & Schulz, 1989). The oxidative half-reaction of BphA4 is a twostep single electron transfer from the reduced FAD to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ferredoxin. Since no experimental evidence has been obtained for the binding site of ferredoxin, the pathway of the electron ¯ow from reduced FAD to ferredoxin remains unclear. It is intriguing to note that there is a completely conserved tryptophan residue (Trp320) among bacterial ONFRs on the si side of the isoalloxazine ring. The side-chain of Trp320 is solventexposed and able to interact with other molecules. Trp320 may play some role in electron transfer from the reduced FAD to [2Fe-2S] cluster of ferredoxin. Common structural features of the active site among ONFRs The present crystal structure and the sequence alignment of eight ONFRs have revealed that the amino acid residues that line the pocket accommodating the isoalloxazine and nicotinamide rings are highly conserved (Figures 2 and 4(c)). Among the residues that line the pocket, Pro49, Leu51, Ser52, Lys53, Glu159 and Trp320 are completely conserved among ONFRs, while Arg48, Leu129, Arg130 and Ile156 are conserved in more than 80 % of the cases. Although Val155, Trp291, and Phe319 exhibit a variety of substitutions, these substitutions are unlikely to cause any signi®cant structural change in the active site, as the sidechains of these residues are located at the periphery of the active site and are not involved in the critical interaction that forms the active site. Thus, not only the structure around the isoalloxazine and nicotinamide rings, but also the relative disposition between the isoalloxazine and nicotinamide rings seems to be well conserved among ONFRs. Since the residues that are likely to have functional signi®cance (Lys53, Glu159, Pro49 and Trp320) are completely conserved, the proposed mechanism of electron transfer in BphA4 may be applicable to other ONFRs. Evolutionary relationship between BphA4 and AIF Previous research has predicted that, based on the sequence similarity between BphA4 and AIF, the three-dimensional structure of these enzymes should be essentially the same (Susin et al., 1999). This prediction is con®rmed in the present study. First, the sequence alignment between BphA4 and

408 Schulz, 1983; Schierbeek et al., 1989; Mattevi et al., 1992; Lantwin et al., 1994). In contrast, BphA4 does not have a disul®de oxidoreductase activity, and hence the dimerization mode can be different from that of the GR-family enzymes. It is seen that, in both the probable dimer forms of BphA4, the concave surface of the molecule is fully accessible for another protein molecule. These distinct features and the low amino acid sequence identity between BphA4 and the GRfamily enzymes suggest that these enzymes diverged at an early stage of evolution, and have acquired distinct functions.

Crystal Structure of Ferredoxin Reductase Ê determination statistics at 2.8 A resolution are shown in Table 1. The obtained electron density map was readily interpretable. Diffraction data from selenomethionyl BphA4 crystals, which were not included in the phase calculation, were used to calculate a difference Fourier map, which clearly indicated the positions of sulfur atoms of Met residues. In the course of the interpretation of the electron density map, we noticed that there were many errors in the previously reported amino acid sequence for BphA4 (Kikuchi et al., 1994a). To ®x the mistakes, DNA sequencing of the corresponding gene bphA4 was performed. The amino acid sequence deduced from the revised nucleotide sequence revealed that the previously reported amino acid sequence contained errors in the following residues: residues 60-95, 104-116, 126-153, 191199, 235-248, 258-259, 266, 276, 324, 330-359 and 381-391. The electron density map was interpreted using the X-ray crystallography applications of the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The crystal structure of the BphA4:NADH complex was determined by the molecular replacement method using the program AMoRe as the lattice constants were signi®cantly different under the cryogenic condition. The crystal structure of native BphA4 was used as a search model for the molecular replacement. Crystallographic re®nement was carried out with È È XPLOR (Brunger, 1992a). The free R-factor (Brunger, 1992b) calculated with 10 % of the data was used to assess the progress of the re®nement. One cycle of the crystallographic re®nement consisted of one simulated annealing procedure with XPLOR followed by model building with QUANTA. Water molecules were automatically added using the program ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993). The results of the crystallographic re®nement are summarized in Table 2. Tools used for geometrical analyses Program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) was used to analyze conformational deviations from the de®ned norm. All the models generated by the above procedures turned out to have good geometry. The polypeptide chain of BphA4 has 340 non-glycine and nonproline amino acid residues. Among these, 304 amino acid residues (89.4 % of the total) have f-c angles in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968). The other 36 amino acid residues (10.6 % of the total) have dihedral angles in the additional allowed regions. Secondary structural segments were determined using the program PROCHECK. Least-squares fitting and amino acid sequence alignment Least-squares ®tting was carried out using the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.). After superimposing structures manually, and the information regarding the corresponding Ca atoms of both the structures given, the molecular similarity routine of the program QUANTA was used to complete the least-squares ®tting. The amino acid sequence alignment between BphA4 and GR-family enzymes was carried out manually on the basis of the least-squares ®tting. Amino acid sequence alignment of BphA4 and ONFRs were carried out using the program ClustalX (Thompson et al., 1997). The obtained results were assessed and

Materials and Methods
Preparation of crystals Puri®cation and crystallization of BphA4 from Pseudomonas sp. strain KKS102 were carried out as described by Yamada et al. (2000). All the crystallization procedures were carried out under aerobic conditions. When preparing the crystals of the BphA4:NADH complex, crystals were soaked in the standard buffer (0.1 M acetate buffer, 2.5 M sodium formate, pH 6.0) containing 10 mM NADH. The standard buffer containing NADH was made anaerobic by bubbling with argon. The soaking was carried out in a sealed depletion-glass to avoid rapid oxidation of the soaked crystal. The crystals belong to the space group P6122 with cell Ê Ê parameters a  b  99.2 A, c  175.0 A at room temperature. The cell parameters were found to be different Ê under cryogenic condition (100 K) with a  b  98.9 A, Ê c  170.9 A. Data collection Diffraction data for the native and derivative crystals were collected at room temperature using an R-AXIS IIc (Rigaku) imaging plate area detector with CuKa radiation (generated by Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator operating at 4.95 kW) (Table 1). The data were processed using the data processing software of the Rigaku R-Axis IIc system. Diffraction data for crystallographic re®nements of native and NADH complex forms were collected using the macromolecule-oriented Weissenberg camera devised by Professor N. Sakabe (Sakabe, 1991), installed at BL18B of the Photon Factory synchrotron radiation source in Tsukuba, Japan (Table 2). To prevent re-oxidation of BphA4, diffraction data of the BphA4:NADH complex were collected at 100 K using CRYOSTREAM (Oxford Cryosystems). The data were processed using the programs DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and SCALA (CCP4, 1994). Structure determination and crystallographic refinement The crystal structure was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method (Table 1). For crystallographic calculations, the CCP4 program suite was used (CCP4, 1994). Using ®ve heavy-atom derivaÊ tives, the phases at 2.8 A resolution were calculated with the program MLPHARE resulting in a ®gure-ofmerit of 0.52. The obtained phases were improved with the program DM (CCP4, 1994) using histogram matching and solvent ¯attening techniques. Structure
