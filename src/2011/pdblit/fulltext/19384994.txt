ABSTRACT Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a crucial class of enzymes in the combat against intracellular free radical damage. They eliminate superoxide radicals by converting them into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. In spite of their very different life cycles and infection strategies, the human parasites Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei are known to be sensitive to oxidative stress. Thus the parasite Fe-SODs have become attractive targets for novel drug development. Here we report the crystal structures of FeSODs ° from the trypanosomes T. brucei at 2.0 A and T. cruzi at ° 1.9 A resolution, and that from P. falciparum at a higher ° resolution (2.0 A) to that previously reported. The homodimeric enzymes are compared to the related human MnSOD with particular attention to structural aspects which are relevant for drug design. Although the structures possess a very similar overall fold, differences between the enzymes at the entrance to the channel which leads to the active site could be identified. These lead to a slightly broader and more positively charged cavity in the parasite enzymes. Furthermore, a statistical coupling analysis (SCA) for the whole Fe/MnSOD family reveals different patterns of residue coupling for Mn and Fe SODs, as well as for the dimeric and tetrameric states. In both cases, the statistically coupled residues lie adjacent to the conserved core surrounding the metal center and may be expected to be responsible for its fine tuning, leading to metal ion specificity.

INTRODUCTION Tropical protozoal parasite infections such as malaria, African sleeping sickness and Chagas' disease represent a major global health problem, causing the death of $1.3 million people per year1 and having serious consequences on economic development in affected countries. A variety of limiting factors associated with the current treatments, mainly drug resistance for malaria, low efficacy and toxicity2 of drugs for sleeping thickness and Chagas' disease, and the limitation of future prospects in term of vaccination justifies the need for the continuing development of efficient drugs against these developing-world diseases. From among many plausible candidates, the enzymes involved in antioxidant defence have emerged as potential new drug targets.3 Despite distinct life cycles, the causative agents of malaria, African sleeping sickness and Chagas' disease in humans, Plasmodium falciparum (the most deadly Plasmodium species), Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, respectively, are all exposed to intense oxidative stress, during at least one stage of their life cycles.4,5 However, an imbalance in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as those caused by some antimalarial and antitrypanosomal drugs,6­8 can lead to parasite death. Additionally, the antioxidant defences found in mammalian hosts present major differences when compared

to the parasitic organisms.3 In particular, the enzyme responsible for the first line of defence against ROS, superoxide dismutase (SOD),9 is represented by different types (containing different metal cofactors) in hosts and parasites, leading to the belief that, the parasitic SODs may represent an alternative molecular drug target for development of specific chemotherapeutic agents. This proposition is further supported by recent antisense RNA experiments in trypanosomatids, which demonstrate a significantly reduced survival of SOD-deficient parasites in macrophages10 as well as in culture.11 SODs are metalloenzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radicals to produce molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. In this reaction, the metal species plays a central role as the redox-active center12,13: Mðnþ1Þþ þ OÀ ! Mnþ þ O2 ; 2 Mnþ þ OÀ þ 2Hþ ! Mðnþ1Þþ þ H2 O2 : 2 ð1Þ ð2Þ

Depending on metal selectivity and structural organization, the SODs can be divided into three different classes: manganese- or iron-containing SODs (MnSOD and FeSOD), which have a common ancestral origin and present a two-domain fold comprised mainly of a-helices and one three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet14,15; copper/ zinc-containing SODs (Cu-ZnSOD), which contain both metals at the active site and adopt a flattened eightstranded Greek-key b-barrel conformation16,17; and Nicontaining SODs (NiSOD), which have been recently identified in Streptomyces spp.18 and in several bacterial genomes,19,20 and present a distinct four-helix antiparallel bundle topology.21,22 The different SOD types posses a widespread distribution in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, appearing either in the cytosol, periplasm or compartmentalized in organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.15,23­27 For instance, while the protozoan parasites P. falciparum, T. cruzi, and T. brucei present only different isoforms of the iron-containing SOD, distributed in the cytosol, glycosomes, and mitochondria,11,28­32 their host human cells possess a mitochondrial MnSOD33 and a cytosolic Cu-ZnSOD. To date, a representative collection of about 20 unambiguous Mn/Fe-containing SOD structures are available in the protein data bank.34 Independent of the metal cofactor, both forms can be present as either homodimers or homotetramers (a dimer of dimers). Their monomers display a similar overall fold and a virtually identical metal-binding site. However, functionality of the majority of Mn/FeSODs strictly depends on metal selectivity,35 with the exception of the ``cambialistic'' SODs, which are active when either of the two metals are present.36,37 Indeed, the interchange of metals (Mn or Fe) in native structures almost invariably results in nearly complete loss of activity.38,39 The most convincing

attempts to explain these observations are based on redox tuning by the polypeptide which allows the metal center to undergo redox changes during catalysis.40,41 Furthermore, experiments have shown that the incorporation of iron into E. coli MnSOD leads to a significant change in the metal environment,42 providing a structural basis for the redox potential tuning hypothesis. This observation, together with the metal coordination invariance during the oxide-reduction cycle of native Mn/FeSODs,42 suggests that SOD sequences impose the correct geometry on specific metals, leading to catalytic active proteins. Although systematic and exhaustive analyses of Mn/ FeSOD sequences and structures have identified specific fingerprints for the Mn- and Fe-containing proteins,43,44 the correlation between sequence and metal on the one hand and geometry and activity on the other, is still not well understood. Here we present for the first time, the crystal structures of the T. brucei and T. cruzi FeSODs (TbSODB2 ° ° and TcSODB1, respectively) solved to 2.0 A and 1.9 A resolution, respectively, as well as a higher resolution struc° ture of the P. falciparum enzyme (PfSOD1) (2.0 A), when 45 A systematic compared to that previously reported. comparison between the parasitic FeSODs and human MnSOD was performed to assess potential differences that could be exploited for the development of specific inhibitors. Finally, we applied statistical residue coupling analyses to the entire Mn/FeSOD family, based on a large multiple sequence alignment in order to address the question of metal specificity. The identification of distinct Fe- and Mn- residue paths surrounding the SOD active site provides useful insights into the metal-tunability imposed by the polypeptide chain. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Protein expression and purification

Recombinant PfSOD1 was expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described.46 TcSODB1 was expressed in fusion with glutathione-S-transferase in E. coli strain ER2566, using the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described,47 and purified using a slightly modified protocol. Briefly, cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium up to an optical density of OD600nm 5 0.6, followed by induction with 0.4 mM IPTG for 20 h at 208C. The culture was then cooled and bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 g for 30 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mL of PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 5 mM DTT. After sonication, the lysed cells were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 20 min at 277 K. The supernatant containing the fusion protein was mixed with 4 mL of glutathione Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 0.15M PBS. The

suspension was incubated with gentle agitation for 3 h at 298 K and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the resin pellet washed with 10 mL of cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0). After three such washes, 4 mL of buffer and 80 units of bovine thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) were added. The mixture was incubated for 48 h at 293 K with two more additions of 80 units of thrombin being made after 16 and 32 h respectively. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged under identical conditions and the supernatant containing the cleavage TcSODB1 was further purified by cation exchange chromatography using a monoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer. TbSODB2 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the expression vector pET28a (Novagen). The protein expression and preparation of the cell lysate followed the same methods applied for the T. cruzi enzyme. The soluble protein was bound to nickel-agarose affinity resin (Qiagen) and washed with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 250 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole. His6tagged protein was then eluted with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 250 mM NaCl, and 150 mM imidazole and subsequently treated with 5 U/mg of thrombin for 16 h to remove the 63His-tag. The purified proteins, which were >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE, were found homogenous according to dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and catalytically active, as determined by the pyrogallol autooxidation method.47

The proteins were concentrated to 5­8 mg/mL and the hanging drop method was used for crystallization screening. The best crystals were obtained by mixing the proteins with an equal volume of reservoir solution composed of 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 24­30% PEG4000 and 0.2 M MgCl2 (TbSODB2 and TcSODB1) or 0.17 M sodium acetate (PfSOD1). Crystals grew to about 0.5 mm in the largest dimension and belonged to space groups P21, C2 and P212121 for TbSODB2, TcSODB1 and PfSOD1, respectively. The unit-cell parameters are listed in Table I, and the asymmetric units contained either one (TcSODB1 and PfSOD1) or two dimers (TbSODB2), ° with respective Matthews' coefficients of 2.3 A3 Da21, 2.2 ° ° 3 Da21 and 2.3 A3 Da21, which suggested an estimated A solvent contents of 44, 45, and 46%, for TbSODB2, TcSODB1 and PfSOD1, respectively. To data collection, the crystals were cryoprotected by rapid soaking in solution containing mother liquor with the addition of 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray generator equipped with R-AXIS IIC (TcSODB1 and PfSOD1) or MAR345dtb (TbSODB2) imaging plates. The data were processed and scaled using the programs MOSFLM48 and SCALA49 from the CCP4

Structure determination and refinement

The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP.50 The crystal structure of the E. coli FeSOD (Protein Data Bank code 1ISA) was used as search model in the cases of TcSODB1 and PfSOD1. The refined model of TcSODB1 was used to solve the structure of TbSODB2. For the refinement, cycles of interactive model building with the program COOT51 was alternated with refinement carried out with the program REFMAC.52 Tight twofold noncrystallo° graphic symmetry restrains (300 kcal/mol-A2) were used in the early stages of refinement and gradually relaxed until significant differences were observed between the individual subunits in the asymmetric unit. The final values of R-work and R-free are 15.8% and 19.4%, respectively, for PfSOD1; 15.7% and 19.8% respectively for

Electron paramagnetic resonance

PfSOD1 at a concentration of $80 lM in 50 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl at pH 5.0 or alternatively in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 was used for CW-EPR measurements. These were undertaken at 4 K using a Bruker-ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer equipped with a rectangular cavity in continuous wave mode at X-band frequency (9.5 GHz) and an Oxford ITC503 cryogenic system. Experimental parameters, such as modulation amplitude and microwave power, were adjusted to achieve good signal-to-noise ratio without signal distortion and saturation. Typical EPR parameters were: modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; microwave power, 10 mW; sweep width, 1500 G; conversion time, 40.96 ms.

sequence. A sequence alignment is given in the Supporting Information. Positional conservation (DGstat) and statistical coupling (DDGstat) were calculated as defined by Lockless and Ranganathan,53 using our own programs, written in C11. To calculate the minimum subalignment size for each perturbation, we have used the procedure described ¨ in Suel et al.54 (Supporting Information), which measures the increase of DGstat for unconserved positions upon random elimination of sequences in the alignment. This demonstrated that a subalignment should have at least 30% of its original size to be statistically significant. Using this criterion, 167 perturbations were possible, some of which correspond to different amino acid perturbations at the same alignment position. In order to identify clusters of statistically coupled positions, the 208 stat 3 167 DDGstat matrix (where each element DDG ij correspond to the response in position i upon the perturbation defined in j) was subjected to hierarchical clustering in Matlab Ver. 7.0 (Mathworks, Natick, MA), using the complete linkage method upon columns and rows. RESULTS

Statistical coupling analysis (SCA)

In order to investigate the possible relationship between statistically coupled sequence positions and metal specificity/oligomeric state, we have applied statistical coupling analysis (SCA)53 to the family as a whole. This method relies on the availability of a large multiple sequence alignment (MSA) allowing for the calculation of two statistical parameters: DGistat, which reflects sequence conservation at each alignment position i, and stat DDGi|j which measures the dependence of the amino acid distribution at i, given a specific perturbation at j (ie, after fixing a given amino acid type at this position). stat When DDGi|j is large, this implies that there is a high correlation between the types of amino acid found at positions i and j, indicating that they are coupled. Groups of residues which are highly coupled on such a pairwise basis can subsequently be grouped into clusters, which often connect residues in the three-dimensional structure which are of functional importance.53,54 SOD sequence codes were obtained from the Pfam server,55 and the sequences themselves were obtained from ExpASY.56 These were aligned in MAFFT,57 and then adjusted to the structured based format in Jalview.58 Reference sequences for which the oligomeric state and metal affinity are well known,43,44 including those solved in this article, were added where necessary. The MSA was edited using the TbSODB2 as reference sequence, excluding the gaps caused by nonconserved regions (leading to 208 positions in the final alignment), and eliminating sequences with more than 90% identity (resulting in 502 sequences). Residue numbers cited throughout this article, therefore, refer to the TbSODB2

Overall description of the structures

The refined models of TcSODB1 and PfSOD1 consist of two polypeptide chains, two iron ions and 458 and 305 water molecules, respectively. A magnesium ion (derived from the crystallization solution) can be observed in the structure of TcSODB1. The TbSODB2 model consists of four polypeptide chains arranged as two dimers. Each chain contains one iron ion and 708 solvent water molecules were identified in the structure. The electron density maps are contiguous for all modeled chains. However, some residues either at the N-terminus (first residue of PfSOD1 and TcSODB1) or C-terminus (final 3 residues of PfSOD1 and 11 residues of TbSODB2) could not be observed. An unexpected oxidation was found at residue Cys83 from both chains of the T. cruzi structure. This artifact probably occurred during thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein which was performed in the absence of DTT, and has no physiological relevance. The overall structures are similar to those of previously solved iron SODs and the nomenclature used for the secondary structures is given in Figure 1(a). This is consistent with the previously described structure for PfSOD1.45 The loop between a1 and a3, which is distant from both active site and dimer interface, presents the largest differences in the mainchain conformation for the three structures presented here [Fig. 1(b)]. As expected, all three structures present a similar dimeric arrangement to that observed previously for homologous FeSODs [Fig. 1(b)]. The most novel feature at the dimer interface is observed in PfSOD1 where His143 presents two conformations, one of which leads

to a salt bridge with Asp144 of the neighbouring subunit and the other interacts with solvent. This disorder was not observed in the previously reported structure of PfSOD1, possibly due to the lower resolution or conceivably due to the lower pH of the crystals which would favour the maintenance of the positive charge on the histidine sidechain. However, the latter seems unlikely given that the FeSOD structure from P. berghei, which was crystallized at pH 4.0, presents similar disorder. Furthermore, neither TbSODB2 nor TcSODB1 present evidence for a second conformation. The two dimers in the asymmetric unit of TbSODB2 are linked by a water layer, and make only two direct hydrogen bonds. This minimal contact is presumably important for crystal packing but is unlikely to signifi-

cantly affect the structure of the dimer, which is the biologically relevant unit.
The active site

The active site geometry is well defined by the electron density map [Fig. 2(a)] and is effectively identical to that reported for homologous SODs. Furthemore, there are no significant differences between the three structures reported here. All present the five ligands (His28, His76, His165, Asp161 and a water molecule) spatially arranged in a trigonal bipyramid around the iron atom.26 Beyond the ligands themselves, the active site neighbourhood also shows the well-conserved hydrogen bonding network involving Trp125, Gln72, Tyr36, His32, and Tyr168 from the vicinal subunit.59 In the case of PfSOD1, this is con-

sistent with the single EPR signal observed at pH 7.0 from a sample identical to that used for crystallization (see Fig. 3). This signal is similar to those reported for many other FeSODs.46 The active site lies at the bottom of a deep funnel formed mainly by a1 and a3 from one subunit and a5 from the other. Significant differences between the three parasite FeSODs reported here and the human MnSOD can only be observed towards the mouth of this funnel. Figure 4 shows the electrostatic potential surfaces in the vicinity of the active site. Significant differences can be seen in the charge distribution as a consequence of nonconservative substitutions, the most significant being a Lys37 in the parasite enzymes which replaces asparagine in HuMnSOD, leading to a greater positive charge density at the channel entrance. The shape of the access channel is also altered, being slightly narrower in the human enzyme due to the presence of Ala in place of Gly at position 33 and Pro in place of Ala at 175 (although the T. brucei enzyme also have proline at this position).

Figure 3
EPR spectrum of the PfSOD1 sample used for the crystallographic analysis. The spectrum at pH 7.0 is similar to that observed for other FeSODs and shows little sign of the unusual signal at g 5 4.38 reported previously. On the other hand, at pH 5, a strong signal at g 5 4.37 is observed suggestive of pH-induced alterations to the local iron geometry.

Features common to the parasite enzymes, such as the positive potential due to Lys37/38/39 can be seen to differ significantly from the human Mn enzyme. The substitution of a glycine in the parasite enzymes by an alanine leads to minor changes to the shape of the cavity.

The SCA procedures yielded three clusters of coupled positions, as can be seen in Figure 5. The appearance of more than one cluster after an SCA procedure has been previously reported,54 but no interpretation for this phenomenon was presented. For SODs, the most welldefined cluster, which lies at the left of the figure (cluster 1), has highly correlated positions which define the oligomeric state of the enzyme. Glu56, Asn68, Thr24, Pro148, and Phe121, as pointed out by Wintjens et al.,43,44 are characteristic of SOD dimers and form a self-consistent cluster, as shown in Table II. The table shows that the presence of one of these residues in each position is generally accompanied by the presence of the others. This demonstrates that the appearance of a well-defined cluster derived from SCA can be caused by the existence of different characteristics (in this case, oligomeric states) in a single protein family, and this characteristic is largely determined by a small number of positions. On the top right portion of the figure, it is possible to identify a number of residues which, according to the analysis of Wintjens et al.,43,44 are characteristic of either Fe dimers (Phe78, Ala71, Ala145, Gln72, and Phe67), or FeSOD in general (Asp170). We

refer to this as cluster 2 and it includes two additional residues (Ala70 and Trp74), not identified by Wintjens et al., whose presence correlates strongly with those previously described. The third and final cluster contains the positions which have been identified as Mn-specific: Gln145, Gly72, Asp146, and Met2543,44 as well as three additional residues: Ala43, Gly159, and Gly71. Figure 6 shows how the statistically coupled residues of each cluster map onto the three-dimensional structure (TbSODB2 taken as a reference). In the case of cluster 1, as expected, most of the statistically coupled positions lie towards the dimer interface. Positions 56 and 148 are the only exceptions and will be discussed below. In the case of clusters 2 and 3, these can be seen to map to regions which are distant from the active site but which make contact with the conserved core of the dimer. This core is defined as being composed of those residue positions whose DGstat values are >80% of the maximum observed for the entire alignment. Clusters 2 and 3 (characteristic of Fe and Mn SODs respectively) are composed of different residue positions but converge on positions 72 and 145, where a glutamine residue performs the equivalent function in Fe and Mn enzymes respectively, stabilizing a water molecule bound to the metal ion. DISCUSSION Based on the appearance of drug resistant strains and the general lack of investment in neglected diseases, it has been argued that there is a need to search for and validate new drug targets for most, if not all, tropical diseases. One foundation stone for such research is knowledge of the genome sequences of the etiological agents responsible for the diseases and this has been successfully accomplished in the case of P. falciparum, T. cruzi, and T. brucei.60­62 A second important contribution comes from the knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of potential targets. Within this context SOD has been proposed to be of potential value and we have gone some way to contributing to this effort by solving two new FeSOD structures (from T. cruzi and T. brucei) and reporting a third structure, that from P. falciparum, to a higher resolution to that described previously. Indeed, the active site geometry of all eight independent monomers solved in this study is very similar to

contrary, our results provide no structural basis which would justify the unusual signal at g 5 4.38 reported previously.46 We therefore repeated the EPR measurements on the highly active sample used for crystallization. At pH 7.0, the spectrum showed effectively no evidence for the g 5 4.38 signal (see Fig. 3) and was very similar to that described for other FeSODs, consistent with the crystal structure. At lower pH however, the unusual signal appears, suggesting that the originally reported spectrum may arise from a mixture of intact and partially altered molecules. The active site itself seems to provide little potential for selective inhibitor design, given its similarity with the Mn site in human MnSOD and its limited dimensions. However, leading towards the molecular surface from the active site itself lies the substrate channel. At the lip of this channel substitutions lead to an alteration in its charge distribution and shape (see Fig. 4) and these alterations are largely common to all three structures described here. They offer the best prospects for exploitation within the region of the active site, with the advantage that a single compound may be effective against all three parasite enzymes. The mechanism of action of previously described FeSOD inhibitors is still unknown and further work will be necessary in order to determine of any such compounds interact with the entrance to the substrate channel.63,64 Other important differences when compared with the human MnSOD include alterations to the dimerization interface. As has been pointed out previously45 this could represent an alternative strategy for the design of specific inhibitors. For example, the residues His143 and Asp144 form a salt bridge in all three parasite enzymes but are replaced by Pro and Asn respectively in HuMnSOD. Although far from trivial, these differences might be exploitable in selective design and it is worth pointing out that the small molecule, 3-(2-benzothiazolylthio)-1-propanesulfonic acid, inhibits triosephosphate isomerase from T. cruzi, by acting in such a manner.65 One issue when considering the usefulness of a potential target is the existence of natural genetic variability and the potential risk of resistance. In the case of PfSOD1 a systematic survey of 26 isolates revealed 11 positions subject to polymorphic variation.66 Figure 7 shows how these map to the crystal structure. In all cases the affected positions lie distant to both the dimerization interface and the active site and its associated substrate channel, suggesting reasons for optimism in the use of SOD as a target. A further aspect pertinent to the structures of proteins from P. falciparum relates to its well-known genomewide nucleotide bias in which A:T represents $80% of the entire genome. In organisms which show such a bias, this is known to result in an altered amino acid composition of the encoded proteins.67 For example, A:T rich genomes, such as P. falciparum,62 present an increased

content of the amino acids FYMINK. Somehow, such proteins must be capable of dealing with a distorted amino acid distribution whilst retaining both threedimensional structure and function. On comparison of the amino acid content of the three SOD structures described here, with respect to the six amino acids cited above, we note that only asparagine and isoleucine are significantly over-represented in the P. falciparum enzyme. There are 23 asparagines and 15 isoleucines in PfFeSOD compared with 12 Asn and 7 Ile in TcSODB1 and 10 Asn and 9 Ile in TbFeSOD. It is not surprising that the excess asparagine residues are distributed widely over the protein surface where substitutions amongst polar amino acids are more readily accommodated. What is more intriguing is the situation with isoleucine. The average solvent accessible area of the isoleucines in PfFeSOD which are conserved in at least one of the remaining two ° enzymes is only 7.7 A2 whilst that of the PfFeSOD° unique isoleucines is 29 A2. Although not completely exposed at the protein surface, the average solvent exposure is significantly greater for the latter group. This seems to suggest that the use of partially solvent exposed positions is an important factor aiding in accommodating bias at the amino acid level, even in the case of hydrophobic amino acids. Interest in the development of inhibitors capable of distinguishing between the parasite FeSODs on the one hand and the human manganese enzyme on the other, inspired interest in better understanding the long-standing conundrum of the structural basis of metal specificity within the Fe/MnSOD family as a whole. Statistical coupling analysis provides a means to examine coevolving and structurally coupled residues which might be characteristic for a given metal, and necessary for the fine-tuning of the active site. As expected, the residues comprising the conserved core surrounding the metal ligands do

not show elevated vales of DDG stat as they are independent of other sequence positions. However, clusters 2 and 3, which specifically characterize Fe and Mn enzymes respectively, make direct contact with this core, and might therefore be expected to influence the metal site indirectly. Such fine tuning may require only relatively subtle changes to the active site, as shown by the study of Edward et al.42 in which changes to N-Fe-N/O bond angles of the order of 208 in Fe-substituted MnSOD were sufficient to allow the coordination of a hydroxide ligand to a sixth coordination position and consequently reduced activity at neutral pH. Further evidence that long-range fine-tuning of the active site takes place comes from site-directed mutagenesis studies of the cambialistic SOD from Porphyromonas gingivalis which was converted to an Fe-specific enzyme by substitution of Gly155 (Gly159 in the numbering scheme adopted here) by Thr. This residue, which is ° located $10 A from the metal, is part of cluster 3 suggesting that other members of the cluster may also play a role in determining metal ion specificity. This hypothesis could be readily tested by future mutagenesis studies. The results of the SCA go some way towards addressing what is sometimes seen to be a conundrum in protein structure, namely the disparity between the size of a full protein structure compared with that of its active site, which typically only involves a handful of residues. Often this is understood in terms of the provision of an appropriately stable three-dimensional framework which is necessary for placing the catalytic residues in the correct orientation. In the case of Fe/Mn SODs, those residues identified by statistical coupling form a further shell of residues extending well beyond the metal site itself. These residues which are probably implicated in the fine tuning of metal specificity, help justify the need for such a large polypeptide chain even for the binding of a biological minute substrate. Similar observations have been made with respect to the specificity-determining regions of serine proteases.68 Our SCA results follow on from comprehensive studies by Wintjens et al.43,44 in which a different approach was used to identify residues which characterize both metal specificity and/or oligomerization state and then apply the findings in an algorithm to predict these characteristics from amino acid sequence alone. There is overall good agreement between the results of both methods. In the case of the Fe-specific cluster two additional residues not specifically described by Wintjens et al.43,44 (A70 and A74) were identified by SCA whereas for the Mn cluster, three extra residues, including Gly159 described above, were statistically coupled to the main group. The appearance of these additional positions suggests that they may also be involved in Mn/Fe discrimination and may present predictive value. We analyzed the presence of each of these residues in the SODs whose binding site metal has already been experimentally determined

(Wintjens et al., Supporting Information) and evaluated their capacity to discriminate between Fe and MnSOD. For FeSODs, residue A70 leads to only 12% false positives (i.e. only 8 out of the 69 sequences which have an alanine at position 70 are not Fe-SODs) and 29% false negatives (ie. 24 out of 85 FeSODs do not present an alanine at this position). This rate of false negatives is very similar to that observed for the Fe-specific residues identified previously (27% on average). However, the level of false positives is slightly higher for A70, being virtually zero for the previously described residues. Residue W74 on the other hand, is a particular case: although it presents no false positives, it has a very high degree of false negatives (65%). Its presence is therefore a strong indicator of iron-containing SODs. Indeed Meier et al.,69 have observed that W74 seems to be related to inactivation by H2O2, a feature that is absent in Mn-SODs. In the case of the Mn cluster, the three previously unidentified residues A43, G159, and G71, have an average of 14% false positives and 20% false negatives, which is very similar to the predictive power of the residues described previously (D146, M25, G72, and Q145) which on average present 10% false positives and 23% false negatives (Full results for all residues described here are included as Supporting Information). Overall these data suggest that the novel residues identified here, which are statistically coupled to those already described as characteristic for a given metal, are approximately equally powerful discriminators of metal specificity and may be useful in giving additional predictive power to the novel method described by Wintjens et al. The third cluster we identify (cluster 1) shows very strong statistical coupling and includes those positions which are characteristic of dimeric structures as opposed to tetramers. One additional residue to those described previously (E56) is distant from the dimer interface and is found within a region which forms part of a second intersubunit interface in tetramers. E56 can therefore probably best be described as antitetrameric and therefore statistically (but not structurally) coupled to the remained of the dimeric cluster. Previous works using the statistical coupling analysis have usually generated a single cluster of coupled residues, which has been interpreted as the ``allosteric core'' of the protein family. Our analysis shows that clusters can emerge in a SCA procedure because of the existence of partitioned characteristics in a single protein family (in our case, the choice for Fe or Mn as the binding site metal, and the choice between dimer or tetramer as the oligomeric state). Since these clusters are obtained using no previous knowledge of the function or structure of the proteins in question, groups of the residues with predictive power to distinguish between these characteristics are obtained without the notion of a ``training set''. This unexpected new interpretation for the Statistical Coupling Analysis, therefore, can have useful applications

in the classification of novel sequences during gene annotation. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank Andre L.B.
