Ion gradients across biological membranes power and help regulate a wide range of crucial processes in all living cells. ATP synthesis is one such process, through a mechanism that is, in its essence, conserved in all domains of life, from archaea to humans. The ATP synthase is the protein machine that serves this purpose across all these life forms. This macromolecular complex consists of two interconnected motor domains; one residing in the lipid membrane (Fo) and one projecting away into the solvent (F1) [1]. The latter domain is where the actual catalysis takes place, following an energy-consuming conformational cycle conducive to ATP formation, from ADP and inorganic phosphate [2]. This cycle is powered within the Fo domain, namely by the rotation of the so-called c-subunit ring (or c-ring) [3­5]; this rotation is

The functional mechanism of the F1Fo ATP synthase, like many membrane transporters and pumps, entails a conformational cycle that is coupled to the movement of H+ or Na+ ions across its transmembrane domain, down an electrochemical gradient. This coupling is an efficient means of energy transduction and regulation, provided that ion binding to the membrane domain, known as Fo, is appropriately selective. In this study we set out to establish the structural and energetic basis for the ion-binding selectivity of the membrane-embedded Fo rotors of two representative ATP synthases. First, we use a biochemical approach to demonstrate the inherent binding selectivity of these rotors, that is, independently from the rest of the enzyme. We then use atomically detailed computer simulations of wild-type and mutagenized rotors to calculate and rationalize their selectivity, on the basis of the structure, dynamics and coordination chemistry of the binding sites. We conclude that H+ selectivity is most likely a robust property of all Fo rotors, arising from the prominent presence of a conserved carboxylic acid and its intrinsic chemical propensity for protonation, as well as from the structural plasticity of the binding sites. In H+coupled rotors, the incorporation of hydrophobic side chains to the binding sites enhances this inherent H+ selectivity. Size restriction may also favor H+ over Na+, but increasing size alone does not confer Na+ selectivity. Rather, the degree to which Fo rotors may exhibit Na+ coupling relies on the presence of a sufficient number of suitable coordinating side-chains and/or structural water molecules. These ligands accomplish a shift in the relative binding energetics, which under some physiological conditions may be sufficient to provide Na+ dependence. © 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

mechanically transduced to the F1 sector through a protein complex referred to as the central stalk [1,6­8]. It is through the motion of the cring rotor that the ATP synthase senses and responds to transmembrane electrochemical gradients (for reviews, see e.g. [9­14]). In most organisms, including all eukaryotes, ATP synthesis is coupled to H+ transport [15], which occurs as the rotor subunit preferentially binds protons originating on the "high" side of the membrane, and releases them onto the "low" side. Only in a few selected anaerobic bacteria is synthesis by F-ATP synthases coupled to translocation of Na+ ions instead, that is, to the sodium-motive force (SMF) [16­18]. Nevertheless, despite this marked imbalance in today's world, compelling evolutionary and structural arguments have been put forward in support of the notion that the SMF predates the proton-motive force (PMF) [19]. It has also been noted that while diverse enzymes can generate the PMF or SMF, only the ATP synthase can use these energy sources for ATP synthesis; thus, the ion specificity of this enzyme, and in particular, of its membrane rotor, determines the type of membrane energetics of a given organism [20]. An important aim in structural and evolutionary bioenergetics is thus to elucidate the mechanisms by which ATP synthases have adapted

in order to power their function from these distinct energy sources. The atomic-resolution structures of the rotor rings of the Na+ and the H+coupled ATP synthases from Ilyobacter tartaricus and Spirulina platensis [21­23], respectively, offer two snapshots of this adaptation process, from which important insights may be derived. These rings consist of 11 and 15 c-subunits, respectively, which form an hourglass-shaped assembly with a central pore. The ion-binding sites (for Na+ or H+) are located in-between neighboring c-subunits, at the outer surface of the ring, and facing the hydrocarbon core of the membrane. A distinct glutamate side chain, conserved across all c-subunits of F-ATP synthases (sometimes substituted by aspartate), appears to play a prominent role in ion coordination. A number of factors may contribute to the ion selectivity in a protein binding site, including its size, coordination number and type of ligands, as well as the relative hydration free energies of the ions involved [24­31]. In the case of protonation, the intrinsic pKa of the ionizable groups involved must also be considered. Here, we set out to establish the structural and energetic determinants of the ion-binding selectivity in the c11 and c15 rings mentioned above, by combining experimental and computational methods. The former are employed first to demonstrate the drastic difference in ion specificity of these two rotors. We proceed to rationalize the emergence of this specificity using atomically detailed molecular dynamics simulations and freeenergy calculations, both for the wild-type rings as well as for a series of mutants that alter the size and/or coordination structure of the ionbinding sites. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Quantitative determination of c-subunit modification with DCCD by direct-infusion ESI-MS measurements c11 rings from the Na+-coupled ATP synthase of I. tartaricus and c15 rings from the proton-dependent ATP synthase of S. platensis were isolated as described previously [32,33]. After dialysis against 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8) buffer the precipitated proteins were stored at + 4 °C. N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) treatment of c-rings was performed in the reaction mixture containing isolated c-rings (final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) either dissolved in 1% (w/v) n-octyl--Dglucopyranoside. The desired pH of the reaction mixture was obtained by combining 20 mM each of the following buffers, MES, MOPS and Tricine (adjusted to pH 5.5 or pH 7.0) or CHES (adjusted to pH 10) as described in [34]. The DCCD labeling reaction was initiated by addition of 50 or 500 M DCCD to the reaction mixture containing c11 or c15 rings, respectively. To terminate the reaction at selected time points, 2-l aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken and diluted in 500 volumes of a H2O/acetonitrile (1:1, v:v) mixture containing 2% formic acid. 6 l of the obtained mixture were immediately submitted to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis by direct infusion using a Bruker ESI-sprayer in a Bruker Apollo source on a micrOTOF-Q-II or a maXis q-TOF mass spectrometers (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) with a flow-rate of 3 µl/min. Using the Bruker micrOTOF-Control 3.0.53 software, the ion optics were optimized for detection of the c-subunits chargestates 4­7 in the range 1100­2200 m/z, and spectra were recorded for 2 min using the parameters described in Table 1. The acquired data were processed using the Bruker software DataAnalysis 4.0 Service Pack 1 Build 253. The spectra were averaged and deconvoluted in the range 1100­2200 m/z using a maximum entropy algorithm, and the peaks in the deconvoluted spectra were assigned using a peak-finder algorithm (Table 1). For quantification of the extent of covalent attachment of DCCD, i.e. formation of dicyclohexyl-N-acyl-urea (DCU), the intensities of the following isotopic peaks were selected. As the signal intensity of the first isotopic peak was typically very low, the isotopic peaks two to nine were used. For the unlabeled species, the peaks with the masses

8790­8798 Da (I. tartaricus c-subunit, ITc1) or 8220­8228 Da (S. platensis c-subunit, SPc1) were used; for DCU labeled c-subunits, the isotopic peaks with the masses 8996­9004 Da (ITc1) or 8426­8434 Da (SPc1) were selected. The intensities of these peaks were integrated after correction with the averaged background values at m/z regions 8600­8700 Da (ITc1) or 8000­8100 Da (SPc1) of the mass spectra. The labeling ratio (as indicated in the figures) was calculated as the ratio of the DCU-labeled species to the sum of the labeled and unlabeled species.

2.2. Molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations All molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out with NAMD 2.6 [35], at constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (298 K), and with periodic boundary conditions. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) with a real space cut-off of 12 Å. A cut-off distance of 12 Å was also used for the van-der-Waals interactions. The pressure was maintained along the membrane normal using a Nose-Hoover Langevin-piston barostat, while the surface area of the membrane was kept at 69 Å2 per lipid [36]. The preparation of the simulation systems was a previously described [22,37,38]. They comprise the full c11 or c15 rings, carrying one Na+ ion or proton per binding site; the membrane, including 237 and 212 POPC lipids, respectively; and  18,000 water molecules. In total, these molecular models amount to  100,000 atoms. To equilibrate the wild-type simulation models we used conventional MD simulations with gradually weaker constraints applied to the protein over 10 ns. Subsequent unconstrained simulations were carried out for 50 ns each. The mutant systems were set up in the same way as the wild types, mutating only one binding site in the ring, and simulated for 5 ns each. The final configurations from these simulations were used to carry out all-atom free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations of the exchange of H+ into Na+ within the same site, and vice versa. As is common, we followed a stepwise protocol, using a coupling parameter  reflecting the progression in the transformation of a given state into another (e.g. from Na+ to H+bound). All MD/FEP calculations were carried out in the forward and backward directions, in 32 intermediate steps; for each step, the equilibration time was 200 ps and the sampling time was 1 ns. The CHARMM27 force field for proteins and lipids [39,40] was used in all calculations.

3. Results 3.1. Direct experimental evidence of differential ion selectivity of c11 and c15 rotors To demonstrate the differential ion-binding selectivity of the c11 and c15 rotors, we measured the extent of DCCD labeling at different pH and salt concentrations. DCCD is a membrane-permeable compound that associates covalently with the key carboxylate group at the csubunit binding site, provided it is protonated [41,42]. By contrast, binding of Na+ to the site precludes protonation and thus protects from DCCD labeling [43]. In this work the extent of DCCD modification of csubunits was quantified on the basis of the mono-isotopic distributions of protein species in deconvoluted ESI-MS mass spectra (Fig. 1a, b). Higher sensitivity and improved reproducibility of the measurements can be obtained after direct infusion of the samples, thus avoiding the additional step of organic extraction of the c-subunits, which was required in previous MALDI-TOF mass-spectroscopy analyses [34]. As shown in Fig. 1c, addition of salt to detergent-solubilized c11 rotors has a marked protecting effect against DCCD labeling. At pH 5.5, for example, where residual Na+ and protons are at similar micromolar concentrations, about 60% of the c-subunits were labeled after 10 min. In 10 mM NaCl, however, labeling is reduced by 2- to 3-fold, reflecting the increased competing ability of Na+ afforded by the concentration

effect. At the other end of the pH scale, at pH 10, DCCD labeling is substantially reduced even without salt added, as the residual Na+ concentration is 4 orders of magnitude larger than that of protons. By contrast, DCCD labeling to the c15 rotor is largely unaffected by added salt (Fig. 1d). Even at pH 10, with Na+ in a 109 concentration excess (100 mM), no substantial protection is observed relative to the extent of labeling with no added salt (similarly for K+ or Li+). In conclusion, protons are selected by the c15 binding sites essentially under any condition, while the H+ selectivity of the c11 ring is sufficiently weak to be countered by excess Na+ in a physiological setting.

3.2. Molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-embedded c11 and 220 c15 rotors 221 Molecular dynamics simulations of the c11 and c15 rings in a POPC lipid membrane were carried out for 50 ns each to assess the structural and energetic stability of the computational protein-membrane model, relative to the X-ray structures--and thus to provide a valid reference state for the subsequent free-energy calculations of binding selectivity. The models comprise the c-rings embedded in a water-solvated membrane patch of approx. 100 × 100 Å2, amounting to about 100,000 atoms (Fig. 2). Both simulations were initiated with the protein in the measured crystal conformation. Subsequently, all descriptors considered, from the

overall ring structure to the ion-coordination chemistry, were found to remain in agreement with the X-ray structure in the 50 ns time-scale (Fig. 3). For example, the distribution of backbone RMSD in the simulated ensemble of conformations, relative to the X-ray structure, peaks at 0.9 Å for the transmembrane sections of the c-rings, and 0.75 Å for the core region enveloping the ion-binding sites (Fig. 3a). The distinct packing of the inner and outer helices is also well preserved. The C­C distances for adjacent E62 and P25 residues (E65 and P28 in c11 numbering) are almost identical in both X-ray structures; the corresponding distributions derived from the simulations are perfectly consistent with that observation--as is the greater staggering and compactness of the c11 ring (Fig. 3b). Similarly, the simulations preserve the distinctive kink in the c11 outer helix (40°), relative to that in the c15 rotor (25°); this difference remains despite the intrinsic dynamical fluctuations of the structure (20°) during the room-temperature simulations (Fig. 3c). Importantly, the coordination geometries of the H+/Na+ binding sites are also in good agreement with the X-ray data (Tables 2, 3); the typical deviations of the simulation averages from the experimental c15 and c11 rotor structures (of resolution 2.1 and 2.4 Å, respectively) are 0.2 Å or less. Lastly, the simulations also provide insights into the mode of interaction of the rings with the lipid membrane (Fig. 3e, f). For example, this analysis confirms the expectation that in the c15 rotor E62 is located not exactly in the membrane middle but towards its cytoplasmic side; this slight displacement also appears to occur in the c11 ring (Fig. 3e). Also in both cases, a small, asymmetric lipid patch plugs the interior of the ring and precludes water permeation; curiously, hydrophobic matching causes these patches to be displaced by about 10 Å relative to the membrane center, towards the extracellular side (Fig. 3f), which presumably facilitates the interaction of the inner face of the ring with subunits in the central stalk of the F1 domain [44].

3.3. Predicted binding-site structures of ion-exchanged and mutant c11 263 and c15 rotors 264 Molecular dynamics simulations were also carried out for wildtype c11 and c15 rings where H+ and Na+ were exchanged, as well as for rings with single and double mutations in the binding sites (in both H+ and Na+-bound states). In each case, the most representative binding-site configuration (coordination geometry, etc) was derived from statistical analysis of the simulation ensembles (Tables 2­5; Figs. 4, 5). These configurations correspond to those characterized below through free-energy calculations of binding selectivity. Experimental structures of these alternative ion-bound states and mutated constructs are not available; thus the results presented here should be regarded as a prediction. It should be noted, however, that some of these are energetically unfavorable, and thus unlikely to occur in reality (e.g. a Na+-bound c15 rotor), as will be discussed in the next section. Nevertheless it is useful to model these high-energy states in order to elucidate the key determinants for ion selectivity. In addition to the conserved carboxylate (in E65/62), the binding sites of the c11 and c15 rotors are alike in the presence of a glutamine

and a tyrosine side chain (Q32/29 and Y70/67), which donate a hydrogen-bond (HB) to E65/62; and in the contribution of a backbone carbonyl from V63/F60, which in the c11 structure coordinates the Na+ ion and in the c15 ring is a HB acceptor for the protonated E62 (Tables 2, 3; Figs. 4a, 5a). The c15 rotor, however, replaces S66 and T67 with two hydrophobic side chains, namely alanine (A63) and leucine (L64) (Figs. 4a, 5a). The latter substitution is worth noting in that it precludes the presence in the site of a structural water molecule, which in the c11 rotor (and possible other Na+ binding c-rings) participates in the coordination of the bound Na+ ion (Table 2, Fig. 5a). This structural water is coordinated by the protein, namely through T67 (backbone amide as donor and side chain hydroxyl as acceptor) and the backbone carbonyl of A64. Lastly, S66 also coordinates the Na+ ion, and in addition is a HB donor for E65 (Table 2, Fig. 5a).

Exchange of H+ by Na+ in the wild-type c15 ring causes the binding site to expand slightly, but the structure appears to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the ion while preserving the network of interactions characteristic of the proton-bound state (Figs. 4a, 5g). Likewise, exchange of Na+ by H+ in the c11 rotor re-organizes the HB network of the site only slightly (Figs. 5a, 4c). Interestingly, S66 becomes a hydrogen-bond bridge between the protonated E65 and the backbone carbonyl of V63, thus effectively mimicking the E62­F60 interaction in the proton-bound c15 ring (which are slightly closer due to a less pronounced kink of the outer helix [23]). The structural water molecule remains stably bound, but it is now co-coordinated by Q32 (as an HB acceptor) in addition to T67 and A64. In summary the c11 ring per se appears to be able to structurally adapt to accommodate a bound proton. This is in accordance with the observation that purified I. tartaricus ATP synthase can mediate proton transport under low salt conditions [17].

3.4. Relative H±/Na± binding selectivity of wild-type and mutant c11 and 343 c15 rotors 344 Although the analysis presented above is highly informative of the intrinsic structural properties of the c-ring binding sites, whether wildtype or mutant, it does not immediately provide a quantitative assessment of the relative energetics of H+ and Na+ binding--that is, into their ion selectivity. Such insight, however, may also be derived computationally under a molecular simulation framework as described below. The binding selectivity of a protein site P for ligand A, against another, B, is defined as the ratio of dissociation constants, S = Kd (B) / Kd (A). The free energy of selectivity is thus Gsel = -kB T log 1 K ðBÞ = kB T log d S Kd ðAÞ

As mentioned above, the configuration of the binding-site was also studied for a series of mutagenized c11 and c15 rotors. The mutations considered are those that make the binding sites in these two rings more alike; they also reflect substitutions often found in other csubunit sequences. Specifically, the mutations introduced in the c11 rotor are S66A, T67L and Y70F, as well as the double substitutions S66A + T67L and S66A + T67I--it should be noted that a consequence of the T67 c11 mutants is the absence of the bound structural water in the site. For the c15 rotor, we considered only the mutation reverse of S66A, i.e. A63S, since a serine side chain at this position is found in csubunits highly homologous to that in S. platensis. Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate the influence of these mutations on the binding-site structure in the c11 and c15 rings, for both the H+ and Na+ bound states, according to our simulations. This analysis predicts a striking similarity in the ion-coordination structures for a similar aminoacid environment, despite the different stoichiometry, and helix packing of these rings. For example, with regard to the proton-bound states, the configuration seen in the wild-type c15 rotor (Fig. 4a) is reproduced in the S66A + T67L c11 ring (Fig. 4f), with E65/E62 reaching across the site towards the backbone carbonyl of V63/F60. Conversely, the A63S mutation in the c15 ring (Fig. 4b) results in a configuration essentially identical to that of T67L c11 (Fig. 4e), where the proton-bound E65/62 is coordinated instead by the serine hydroxyl. Regarding the Na+-bound states, our results appear to reflect a prominent role of the cation in organizing its own coordination shell, whether in the c11 or c15 rotor. Thus, the amino-acid substitutions considered here have little impact structurally, with the re-arrangement of the E65/62 carboxylate being the most noticeable, e.g. in c11 S66A (Fig. 5b). Lastly, it is again worth noting how, from the structural point alone, these distinct rotors can in principle produce similar coordination geometries--e.g. compare c11 T67L and c15 A63S (Fig. 5c, h).

That is, the free energy of selectivity is also Gsel = Gp - Gw. Gw is simply the difference in the hydration free energy of each ligand; Gp can be thought of as a difference "interaction free-energy" of protein and ligand while in the bound state. In the case of ions as non-covalent ligands (e.g. Na+ vs. K+), both contributions may be readily computed with classical MD simulations via the free-energy perturbation (FEP) method, since the corresponding energy functions (state A and B) differ solely in the non-bonded electrostatic and/or van-der-Waals terms. The usefulness of this approach has been illustrated, for example, in studies of selective ion channels and ion-coupled membrane transporters [45,46]. The problem is slightly more complex when comparing, e.g. H+ and Na+, as the proton binds covalently. This is clear from the following thermodynamical cycle: P þ H3 Oþ G H

formation energetics--and thus the covalent "interaction" of the proton and the site would be neglected. (In principle, the computation of Gp would require DFT or similar ab initio methods. This approach, however, is not realistically applicable to a molecular system of the dimensions of the c-ring--unless other approximations were made e.g. artefactual discontinuities in the energy function. Even then, the statistical significance of the results would be comparatively much poorer.) Nevertheless, for our purpose the classical approach remains valid, as the quantity of interest is the relative selectivity, Gsel, between, say, a site of wild-type sequence composition and a mutated one,

The assumption made here is that it is possible to separate the quantum-mechanical contribution to Gp arising from the energy of the chemical H+ bond (or intrinsic), and that from the amino-acid composition and structure of the site (or contextual). As the former is by definition inherent to the carboxylate group, it can be safely assumed that its contribution to Gp is negligible. The change in selectivity upon mutation thus arises from the different contextual influence of the sequence and structure of the site (via electrostatics, steric constraints, etc.), which is in principle captured by the classical forcefield. Under this general framework, we have calculated the relative H+/ Na+ binding selectivities of the wild type c11 and c15 rings, and of the mutated sites described for each in the previous section. The results are presented in Fig. 6. Our calculations demonstrate, first, how the c15 ring from S. platensis is­as required physiologically­much more highly selective for H+ than the c11 ring from I. tartaricus, by about 16 kcal/mol, or about 10 orders of magnitude in terms of the binding affinity. Second, our comparative analysis of the wild-type and mutated sites demonstrates that it is through the substitution of hydrophobic groups by polar ones that an increased Na+ selectivity may be accomplished in these structures. For example, the A63S mutation in the c15 rotor reduces its H+ selectivity against Na+ by about 9 kcal/mol; conversely the S66A mutation in the c11 ring increases its proton-binding propensity by about 5 kcal/mol, consistent with the impaired Na+ binding capacity shown for this mutant [34]. Additional hydrophobic substitutions in this rotor further reduce its affinity for Na+ but not H+; e.g. T67L, which removes the bound structural water molecule, has a comparable effect to S66A. The double mutant S66A/T67L is in its sequence composition identical to the wild-type c15 rotor, and accordingly it is very highly H+ selective, despite the fact that the size

of this mutated site can perfectly accommodate a Na+ ion. That is not to say that size is irrelevant; in fact, the more size-restricted S66A/T67I mutant is also more H+ selective than S66A/T67L, and only slightly less so than the wild-type c15 ring itself. Lastly, we have also considered the Y70F mutation in the c11 rotor. This is the only binding-site c11 mutant for which experimental data pertaining to H+/Na+ competition is available to date [34]--therefore it represents a good control system for our theoretical analysis. As shown in Figs. 5a and 4c, Y70 is only indirectly involved in the ion-binding site through its interaction with E65, both in the Na+ and H+ bound states. The strength of this H-bonding interaction, however, can be expected to be stronger in the Na+ bound state because the carboxylate group is charged; in other words, its stabilizing role is more energetically prominent in the Na+ bound state than the H+ state. Accordingly, the Yto-F transformation is about 4 kcal/mol more unfavorable in the Na+ bound state; the corresponding change in selectivity upon mutation, computed as for the other mutants, is in good agreement with this figure (Fig. 6; note that ideally these values should be identical), i.e. the Y70F mutant is more H+ selective than the wild type. Most importantly, these results are consistent with the experimental observation that the pH profile of DCCD labeling shifts by 2­3 units (3­4 kcal/mol) in Y70F relative to wild type, under equal Na+ concentrations [34].

quantitative assay of DCCD modification under varied pH and salt concentrations. DCCD modification is a non-reversible reaction that occurs when the carboxylate group of E65/62 is protonated, while in the presence of Na+ the charged E65/62 would not react. Thus, although this approach precludes a direct estimation of relative binding equilibrium constants (as well as pKa values), it is a well-established means to demonstrate the competition of protons and Na+ ions for a given binding site [43,47­49]. In our case, the observation that a 109 excess of Na+ over H+ provided no significant inhibition of DCCD-labeling of the c15 rotor ring from S. platensis allows us to conclude that the H+ selectivity of this rotor is very pronounced, i.e. in the order of 13 kcal/mol or greater. This lower-bound estimate is consistent with proton-current measurements mediated by the c-rings of Rhodobacter capsulatus [50]; for comparison, it is worth noting that the binding selectivity of most K+ channels against Na+ is about 5 kcal/mol, or 1,000-fold [51­53]. The extreme proton specificity of the c15 rotor is in clear contrast to the c11 ring from I. tartaricus, the labeling of which can be readily inhibited by excess Na+. Nonetheless, the large extent to which the c11 rotor can be DCCD-modified under equal concentrations of H+ and Na+ indicates that this ring is­strictly speaking­also H+ selective, albeit much more weakly. This conclusion is consistent with a previous electrophysiological study of a highly homologous c11 rotor (from Propionigenium modestum), liposome-reconstituted along with the accessory subunit-a [33,54]. Specifically, Kluge et al. [33,54] showed that this rotor facilitates transmembrane H+ exchange maximally when no NaCl was added to the preparation--it should be noted, though, that residual Na+ is inevitably in the order of 10 M, i.e. a non-negligible 100fold excess over H+, at pH 7. The observation of marked H+ transport under these conditions therefore demonstrates that this rotor may be either weakly or strongly H+ selective, but certainly not Na+ selective. In addition, the measurements showed that a 10,000-fold concentration excess of Na+ was required to "completely abolish" H+ transport (see also [17,55] for analogous results with holo ATP synthases from P. modestum and I. tartaricus, respectively). Consistent with our DCCD labeling measurements, this second observation implies that the H+ selectivity of the c11 ring is rather weak, compared with the c15 rotor, i.e. probably 10 to 100-fold, or 2­3 kcal/mol. A similarly weak H+ selectivity (3-fold) has been recently measured for the K10 ring of the Na+-coupled V-type ATPase from Enterococcus hirae [56]. Under typical physiological settings, the concentration of free Na+ greatly exceeds that of protons (10­500 mM vs. pH 4­10). That is to say, ATP synthases whose rotors are non-selective or weakly H+ selective will be functionally coupled to Na+. From a physico-chemical standpoint, however, the presence of a conserved carboxylate group (mostly E, occasionally D) at the binding site imposes a strong bias towards H+ selectivity a priori. This is clear from the fact that in aqueous solution, the intrinsic H+ affinity of a glutamate side chain (reflected by its pKa) is about 100 M, while the extent to which it binds Na+ is negligible (monosodium glutamate is a common dissociable salt). Structurally, therefore, a general principle would be that a protein binding site whose energetics is dominated by a carboxylate group will be strongly H+ selective. To weaken this propensity, other chemical groups must be brought together so that they can contribute to the coordination of a non-covalently bound ion such as Na+. By contrast, a more hydrophobic environment, possibly but not necessarily also restricted in size, would strengthen the H+ selectivity of the site to the extreme degree observed e.g. in the c15 rotor. Our computational analysis of the structure and dynamics of the c11 and c15 rotors, as well as of the in silico mutants thereof, is clearly consistent with this general principle. The free-energy calculations clearly demonstrate the emergence of H+ selectivity as polar groups (able to co-coordinate Na+) are gradually substituted by hydrophobic ones (which cannot), i.e. as the energetic prominence of the key glutamate side chain is further enhanced by the uncompensated cost incurred by the desolvation of the Na+ ion. We have also shown that while the restricted size of the binding site can be a contributing factor for

UN

H+ selectivity (see c11 T67L vs. T67I vs. c15 WT), it is not essential--i.e. a binding site with ample space for Na+ binding will be nonetheless highly H+ selective if it is dominated by the carboxylate group, especially in a hydrophobic environment. Such a spacious site is not observed in the c15 ring, but it is likely to be observed in other H+-selective rotors with different c-subunit stoichiometries or staggering of the transmembrane helices. Likewise, the strong selectivity of the c15 ring may be surpassed by other rotors, such as those in many bacterial species and all eukaryotic mitochondria (animals, plants and fungi), where the ion-binding motif is apparently limited to the conserved E/D carboxylate, and possibly backbone carbonyl groups. The c11 rings from I. tartaricus and P. modestum probably lie at the other side of the selectivity spectrum, as they bring together up to four coordinating Na+ ligands in addition to the key glutamate; whether their H+ selectivity can be weakened further, by additional or more polar ligands remains to be elucidated. In any case, the role of these additional protein ligands as effective "inhibitors" of the baseline H+ selectivity of the c-subunit can be clearly inferred from the observation that E. coli c-rings, mutagenized so as to resemble in part those of P. modestum, are indeed able to bind Li+ ions [57]. An interesting observation emerging from the simulations of the c11 and c15 rings is the structural plasticity of the binding sites. For example, it is remarkable that despite their very different stoichiometry and distinct c-subunit structure and packing, both rotors may adopt identical interaction networks for the same ligand and similar sequence. This similarity is especially clear when comparing the H+ bound states of the c11 S66A/T67L double mutant and the wild-type c15 ring. The distinct interaction observed in the latter between E62 and the backbone of F60, i.e., between adjacent subunits, may not have been anticipated for the c11 ring, because the greater kink of its outer helix makes the equivalent carbonyl (of V63) more distant. However, the simulations clearly show that the glutamate side chain (E65) can accommodate this difference and form an identical interaction in the H+ bound c11 ring, if no other competing interactions are possible. Instead, it appears that it is the side chain of S66 (or A63 in the c15 ring) that controls whether the protonated glutamate will hydrogen-bond to the carbonyl or not; consistently, in the c15 A63S mutant, the side-chain hydroxyl group is the hydrogen-bond acceptor of E62 (as in the wild-type c11 ring), and the donor of the F60 backbone carbonyl. Indeed, this serine is present in many protoncoupled rotors; we anticipate that its role in H+ coordination in these rings will be similar to that uncovered here. In view of the hypothesis that the SMF preceded the PMF during evolution [19], it seems paradoxical that the emergence of more H+ selective ATP-synthase rotors appears to have entailed a simplification of the ion-coordination chemistry in the binding site. However, as has been noted elsewhere [20], the emergence of PMF-based bioenergetics necessarily entailed the introduction of greater complexity in the structure of cellular membranes, with different organisms arriving at very different proton-impermeable solutions. Nonetheless, it is also worth noting that, as Fig. 6 suggests, a single substitution in a c-subunit binding site may in some cases be sufficient to transform a moderately but clearly H+ selective ring into one that could be coupled to Na+ in a physiological setting, and vice versa (e.g. c11 T67L or S66A to WT). It is thus conceivable that the evolutionary adaptation between the SMF and PMF has not been strictly unidirectional across all life forms. At any rate, we speculate that other membrane­protein systems selectively coupled to H+ or Na+-exchange may have followed similar principles as those outlined in this work.
