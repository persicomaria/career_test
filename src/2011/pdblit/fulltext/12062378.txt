These and other microgravity experiments have focused on the production of protein crystals with improved size and quality [2­5]. An understanding of the physical basis for the quality and size improvements produced from the diffusion-limited environment available on an orbiting spacecraft is being developed from both theoretical analysis [6,7] and experimental observations [8,9].

improvements in crystal size and X-ray diffraction quality from crystals grown in microgravity, an application of microgravity in structure determination by neutron diffraction has not been previously reported. In this paper, we described details of the crystal growth, data collection by neutron diffraction and refinement of a monoclinic form of hen egg white lysozyme determined at ( 2.1 A. This structure is the first in the initial exploratory effort to establish methods and procedures for a series of crystal growth and macromolecular analyses by neutron diffraction. Neutron diffraction has been used to analyze protein structures since the late 1970s [10], and the technique has evolved more recently into the combination of imaging plate with quasi-Laue methods [11,12]. Neutron diffraction, with its capability of resolving hydrogen/deuterium atoms, plays a special role in macromolecular crystallography. It can be used to identify hydrogen bonds, to distinguish carbonyl oxygen and NH2 (or ND2) groups in carboxylamines, or to locate and orient water molecules, which can play key roles in protein ligand interactions and enzymatic catalysis. However, neutron sources are several orders of magnitude weaker than X-rays, and only a small number of them are available for structural studies, which are the main obstacles for its wide applications. For the past three decades, just a handful of proteins have been analyzed by neutron diffraction [13­23]. Proteins, and other hydrogen (or even deuterium) containing organic materials, have large incoherent scattering cross sections for neutrons, which result in high background levels at high scattering angles, and hence the observed resolutions are usually lower as compared with their Xray counterparts. The combination of quasi-Laue methods with neutron-sensitive image plates has tremendously increased data collection efficiency at the cost of a modest increase in background levels. However, to further compensate for the low flux of neutron sources, large (> 1 mm3) and strongly diffracting crystals are required to increase the signal levels. Unfortunately, because of the common problem of defects propagating in macromolecular crystals, they usually are neither large nor strong scatterers. Improvements in size

and intrinsic order for crystals grown under microgravity conditions should help make the applications of neutron diffraction to structural biology more practical. The International Space Station is expected to offer long duration protein crystal growth experiment opportunities to support further exploratory efforts.

2. Experimental conditions Crystals of the monoclinic form of lysozyme were grown under microgravity conditions using bulk counter-diffusion methods developed for the DCAM [1] during NASA Mir Increment 7. Large crystals of monoclinic lysozyme were produced by equilibrating a 2.5 ml chamber containing 25 mg/ ml of lysozyme, and 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.55 with a 7.5 ml chamber containing 6% (w/v) sodium nitrate in water. The optimum equilibration rates were determined experimentally by the application of gel infused plugs with selected lengths and pore sizes. In this case, the best conditions utilized gel plugs of 2 mm in diameter and 25 mm in length, which produced crystals with longest dimensions on the order of 1.25 cm [1]. This monoclinic crystal form contains two lysozyme molecules in the asymmetric unit and the X-ray structure has been determined to a ( resolution of 1.8 A [24]. At the end of the microgravity experiment, several large crystals were available and were mounted in capillaries one week before the beginning of the neutron diffraction experiments. Unfortunately, difficulties in obtaining custom capillaries of sufficient size in time for the neutron diffraction experiments restricted the size of the crystals examined during the analysis. The H2O buffer used for crystallization was exchanged by vapor diffusion equilibration against 20 ml of a D2O buffer of the same composition without direct contact between the crystal and the drop of D2O buffer. This would allow the exchange of H atoms with D atoms without damaging the crystal. The D2O buffer solution was renewed five times during one week. The neutron diffraction experiments were performed at the Institut Laue­Langevin (ILL, Grenoble) using neutron imaging plates on the

Laue diffractometer LADI [11,25]. A Ti/Ni multilayer filter was used to select a bandwidth of ( Dl=l ¼ 20% centered at l ¼ 3:5 A. The quality of several crystals was checked using 1 h static exposures on LADI. Some were twinned and the best preliminary results were obtained using a crystal with dimensions 5.6 Â 1.4 Â 0.8 mm3 (c.a. 6.3 mm3), which was selected for data collection. Using this crystal, a total of 22 stationary images were collected, each of them being exposed for 14 h. The f rotation about the spindle axis was incremented by 81 between successive images. Fig. 1 shows a quasi-Laue diffraction images. The neutron LAUE data were indexed with LAUEGEN [26] adapted for neutron diffractometry with a cylindrical detector (diameter 31.8 cm), and integrated with the ILL local program INTEGRATE. Integrated data were normalized to account for the incident intensity spectrum using the program LAUENORM [26] with data in ( 40 bins of wavelengths between 3.05 and 3.9 A. A total of 24 330 accepted reflections were merged to provide 7426 independent reflections to a resolu( tion of 2.1 A, with R@mergeðIÞ ¼ 11:0%, completeness=60.7% and an overall multiplicity of 3.3. The crystal morphology required that it be mounted with its two-fold axis b close to the

spindle axis, which explains in part the low data completeness.

3. Refinement The refinement was performed with SHELXL97 [27], using the coordinates of the X-ray structure [24] available in the Protein Data Bank [28] (reference number 5LYM). In the beginning, all the solvent molecules were not included. The Cambridge Structural Database [29] was searched to find the best bond distances involving H atoms in structures of small molecules determined by neutron diffraction, since these distances are usually longer than X-ray distances. These modified distances were introduced in the HFIX instructions of SHELXL97 and all the nonexchangeable H's were introduced in idealized positions. For exchangeable H atom positions, at ( this medium resolution (2.1 A) it would not be possible to resolve all H's and D's with Fourier maps. Due to lack of independent detailed knowledge toward the completeness of H/D exchange process, we decided to test three different models for possible choice as a refinement starting model: Model-A, no H/D exchange; Model-B, with all

exchangeable H's discarded; Model-C, with all exchangeable H's replaced by D's. The three models were subject to two rounds of rigid body refinement ( against data of resolution limits of 6 and 4 A, respectively. The results are listed in Table 1. The overall results favor the Model-B, where exchangeable H's have been omitted. As the scattering lengths for H and D are @3.74 and 6.67 fm, respectively, Model-B may represent a mixture of exchangeable H/D (B64/36), perhaps suggesting that the exchange process has not been ``complete''. The refinement began with Model-B, and loose non-crystallographic symmetry restraints of 1­4 distances (i.e., the interatomic distance which defines the torsional angle of a string of four covalently bonded atoms for fixed bond distances and valence angles) were introduced for refinement stability. The refinement process alternated between conjugated gradient least-squares calculations and visual examinations of the Fourier maps. During these latter steps, the protein model was subject to minor adjustments according to the Fourier maps. D2O solvent molecules were also located at this stage, which were usually selected in a difference Fourier map and then confirmed in a (2Fo@Fc) Fourier synthesis map, assuming the H2O/D2O exchange to be more or less ``complete'' for solvent water molecules. It should be noted however that if exchange is incomplete, water molecule positions will contain significant H isotopic concentration and their near zero total scattering lengths make them almost ``invisible'' on Fourier maps at this medium resolution. The low data/parameters ratio made it necessary to fix occupancies of all D2O molecules at unity throughout the least-squares procedure.

At late stages of the least-squares refinement, each exchangeable hydrogen position on the protein molecules was described simultaneously by an H atom and by a D atom, sharing the same coordinates and temperature factor (instructions EXYZ and EADP in SHELXL97 package). The occupancy factors were refined by a ``free variable'' (instruction FVAR in SHELXL97) which constrains the sum of occupancies of H and D to unity. To reduce the number of variables, it was assumed that H/D atoms attached to the same ``heavy'' atom have the same H/D mixture ratio. With this assumption, there are still 408 additional ``free variables'' assigned to the H/D mixture ratios. During the refinement, a few of the free variables describing the relative (H/D) occupancies shifted to values outside the allowable range (0.0­1.0). Since there is no mechanism in the program to restrain the free variable between 0 and 1, they were reset to zero or unity between the refinement rounds. The least-squares refinements were generally stable for protein atoms. On the other hand, some of the D2O molecules, starting from well-fitted position and orientation on Fourier maps, ended up with slightly misoriented and/or shifted positions, which had to be readjusted during the visual examination. This unstable behavior could be related to an incomplete H2O/D2O exchange and/or to the fact that the additional information available on H/D positions in a neutron analysis make refinement more demanding than against Xray data: even with constraints or strong restraints on the rigidity of D2O molecules, it still requires six parameters to define the location and orientation for each D2O molecule, while in X-ray cases one usually needs only three to define oxygen positions.

resolution X-ray structure. A total of 82 D2O molecules were included in the final model. Of these, 31 are located at nearly identical positions to those in the X-ray structure (PDB 5LYM). Because both D and O atoms contribute to neutron diffraction at these medium resolutions, many D2O molecules appear as nicely shaped triangles in Fourier maps. Examples are shown in Fig. 3. As previously explained, the H/D ratios of the exchangeable H's on the protein molecules were refined by free variables at the final stage of refinement. It should be pointed out that the introduction of large numbers of additional variables caused a slight increase in the R(free); to a certain degree this is an indication of overparameterization. Nevertheless, the average value for these variables is 42%. This average value approximately corresponds to a mixture of H/D of 42/58, which suggests a more ``complete'' exchange process than Model-B (64/36). Clearly, hydrogens that are buried within the protein or that are involved in stabilizing secondary structure (e.g., beta sheets) are protected and, therefore, slow to exchange. Generally speaking, for protein crystals, the H/D exchange will proceed rapidly through bulk solvent, then extend to bound solvent water,

and finally to the exchangeable hydrogens on protein molecules. Since it is estimated that 34% of the volume of these crystals is occupied by solvent, assuming that the solvent was pure water, this would allow approximately 600 water molecules (with 1200 exchangeable H's) per asymmetric unit including the bound water molecules. There are only 500 exchangeable H's on the two lysozyme molecules (there are additionally over 1400 carbon-bonded non-exchangeable H's). Therefore, with 58% completion on the protein molecule, the H/D exchange process should approach completion in bulk solvent region. The H/D exchange process could be considered essentially complete for the purpose of reducing incoherent scattering background (namely, a longer exchange process would not significantly reduce the incoherent scattering background), while it still leaves us with uncertainty in isotopic content on

the protein and the bound solvent waters for refinement process. Fig. 4a is a (2Fo@Fc) Fourier map showing that N and O atoms on the sidechains of residues Asn 103 and Asn 106 are clearly differentiated. Here, the N atom with its two attached D atoms have a far greater total scattering length than that of the O atom. The phase set used in this map calculation is the one prior to introduction of H/D mixture for exchangeable hydrogens. In X-ray experiments, the total scattering factors of N and O atoms are very similar and usually indistinguishable. Fig. 4b is the final (2Fo@Fc) map showing a tyrosine residue (Tyr 53 of molecule A). Whilst the carbon-bonded H's are not resolved at this resolution (H atoms should show in negative scattering contours), the positive scattering density contour indicates a high deuterium concentration at the exchangeable position.

5. Conclusion While this initial exploratory study was not focused on justifying microgravity as a vehicle for the production of large crystals for neutron analysis, it is encouraging that the space grown protein crystals were of sufficient size and diffraction quality to enable a neutron diffraction study of the protein. Presently, this adds a third crystal form of hen egg white lysozyme to the list of structures already determined by neutron diffraction [12,31]. The refinement of the `heavy atoms' (C, N, O) of the protein yielded a structure of good quality. Moreover, this study shows that at medium resolutions, typical for protein structure determinations, neutron data are capable of determining the orientation of the carboxylamine group of glutamine and asparagine residues, and determining locations and orientations of water solvent molecules in the crystal. Clearly, these capabilities could provide important complementary information for ligand binding and/or enzymatic catalysis. However, it is very important that the crystals used for neutron studies should either be grown in deuterated buffer, or should go through sufficiently long period of H/D exchange processes. Fully deuterated proteins (including carbon-bonded H's) can be produced using bacterial expression systems with deuterated medium [30], This would further reduce incoherent background scattering and increase the signal-to-background ratio by up to an order of magnitude. A completely perdeuterated crystal not only reduces the significant incoherent scattering background from H atoms, but also makes it easier to locate water solvent and other D atoms on the protein. Moreover, a definitive isotopical content (100% deuterium at all exchangeable hydrogen positions) drastically simplifies the model for least-squares procedures. Generally, protein crystals do not diffract much ( better than 2.0 A, and therefore, the number of measurable diffraction data points is somewhat limited. Stereochemical restraints are typically applied to reduce the number of parameters required to define a protein molecule, but for most X-ray structure refinements at medium resolution, the poor data/parameters ratio still

leaves refinement by least-squares procedures underdetermined. The situation is more pronounced for neutron diffraction, because twice as many atoms (including H and D atoms) are capable of contributing significantly to diffraction, and therefore must be defined and included in the model. The analysis can be further complicated by uncertainty in the progress and extent of H/D exchange when crystals are soaked against D2O. However, as we described, the pattern of exchange on individual O and N atoms throughout the protein can be modeled and utilized to provide meaningful information and insights on specific group accessibility, mobility and dynamics of the protein. The added difficulties in refinement should be regarded as the price to be paid for having access to additional invaluable information.
