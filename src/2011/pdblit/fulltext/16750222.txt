Affibody binding proteins are selected from phage-displayed libraries of variants of the 58 residue Z domain. ZTaq is an affibody originally selected as a binder to Taq DNA polymerase. The anti-ZTaq affibody was selected as a binder to ZTaq and the ZTaq:anti-ZTaq complex is formed with a dissociation constant Kd = 0.1 M. We have determined the structure of the ZTaq:anti-ZTaq complex as well as the free state structures of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq using NMR. Here we complement the structural data with thermodynamic studies of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq folding and complex formation. Both affibody proteins show cooperative two-state thermal denaturation at melting temperatures TM  56 °C. ZTaq:anti-ZTaq complex formation at 25 °C in 50 mM NaCl and 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.4) is enthalpy driven with H°bind = ­9.0(±0.1) kcal mol-1. The heat capacity change CP°,bind = ­0.43(±0.01) kcal mol-1 K-1 is in accordance with the predominantly non-polar character of the binding surface, as judged from calculations based on changes in accessible surface areas. A further dissection of the small binding entropy at 25 °C (­TS°bind = ­0.6(±0.1) kcal mol -1 ) suggests that a favourable desolvation of non-polar surface is almost completely balanced by unfavourable conformational entropy changes and loss of rotational and translational entropy. Such effects can therefore be limiting for strong binding also when interacting protein components are stable and homogeneously folded. The combined structure and thermodynamics data suggest that protein properties are not likely to be a serious limitation for the development of engineered binding proteins based on the Z domain.

Introduction
Combinatorial protein engineering has been applied to develop artificial proteins that can bind to selected targets with high affinity and be used as alternatives to antibodies.1,2 One class of engineered proteins called affibody proteins is based on the Z domain, a 58 residue three-helical bundle derived by a single amino acid substitution in the B domain of

staphylococcal protein A (SPA).3 The Z domain binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulins as do the five homologous SPA domains, but unlike the parental domain it does not bind to the Fab region. Affibody binders are obtained from a combinatorial library consisting of Z-domain variants created by randomization of 13 residues located in the Fc binding region.4 Specific binders to selected targets are then obtained using phage-display technology. Affibody proteins have been engineered for applications in bioseparation,5­7 detection,8­10 and biotherapy.11,12 Beside their use in biotechnology, affibody proteins are also good model systems to study basic mechanisms of protein­protein recognition. We have in previous work determined the threedimensional structure of the complex between the ZSPA-1 affibody and its target the Z domain,13 and shown that both coupled folding and induced fit events are associated with this binding reaction.

1306 interaction between the Z domain and ZSPA-114 revealed that the, in this case, rather weak affibody binding (dissociation constant Kd = 1 M) is due to a large conformational entropy penalty for complex formation. Any detailed investigation of the mechanisms that regulate binding specificity and affinity requires that the structures of all of components in the system under study can be determined. This was not possible with Z:ZSPA-1, since severe line broadening in the NMR spectrum prevented a structure determination of (free) ZSPA-1. In this and the accompanying work15 we study another affibody complex, ZTaq:anti-ZTaq, which allows for a comprehensive characterization of free and bound proteins. The complex represents an example of an affibody (antiZTaq) for which the selection target (ZTaq) is also an affibody.16 The ZTaq affibody was originally selected for affinity to Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase to which it binds with a dissociation constant Kd = 25 nM.17 Anti-ZTaq was selected as a binder to ZTaq with Kd = 100 nM, which means that the ZTaq: anti-ZTaq complex is about ten times stronger than the Z:ZSPA-1 complex. We have previously determined the structure of the ZTaq:anti-ZTaq complex and the free state structures of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq using NMR spectroscopy.15 The proteins both use helices 1 and 2 to interact with each other in a perpendicular manner. The binding surface area lies in the range of what is typical for protein­protein complexes. However, the interface is very hydrophobic compared to typical native protein­protein complexes. 18 Substantial side-chain rearrangements (induced fit), in particular of aromatic side-chains on ZTaq, occur upon complex formation. Other interesting features are close contacts between two glycine residues in ZTaq and anti-ZTaq, respectively, which lead to the formation of intermolecular H hydrogen bonds, and that the guanidinium ­NH2 groups of an arginine side-chain in ZTaq form four backbone hydrogen bonds to anti-ZTaq. The binding interface also shows several similarities with other complexes involving affibody proteins or SPA domains, suggesting that affibody proteins inherit intrinsic interaction properties from the original SPA surface. Here, we present a biophysical characterization of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq and data describing the thermodynamics of complex formation. The combination of structural and biophysical information is essential if a quantitative understanding of recognition and binding in water solution is to be achieved. However, there are few, if any, examples in the literature of biomolecular complexes for which the structures of all components in the binding equilibrium have been determined and complemented with thermodynamics measurements under identical conditions. One objective of the present work has therefore been to provide such information for the present ZTaq:anti-ZTaq model system. Another objective has been to evaluate to what extent the binding thermodynamics in this case can be related to changes in polar and non-polar accessible

surfaces. We also estimate the contributions to binding entropy from desolvation and conformational effects for comparison to the related Z:ZSPA-1 affibody complex.

Results
Characterization of the unbound states of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq ZTaq and anti-ZTaq do not display the molten-globule like characteristics that are observed in ZSPA-1.13,19 Instead, the 1H, 15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectrum of both proteins (Figure 1) shows sharp resonances and favourable dispersion. This enabled us to determine detailed free state structures. 15 Both proteins also have comparably high melting temperatures (Figure 2) with TM = 56 °C for ZTaq and TM = 57 °C for anti-ZTaq, in contrast to ZSPA-1 for which TM = 41 °C.13 In addition, there is only a small increase in fluorescence intensity of the hydrophobic dye 8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (ANS) when it is added to ZTaq or anti-ZTaq solutions (not shown). The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of ZSPA-1 is concentration dependent, indicating self-association coupled to conformational change.13 Conversely, the CD properties of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq are not concentration dependent at concentrations below 1 mM (not shown). The biophysical properties of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq are consistent with their structures, 15 which are well-folded with a hydrophobic core that is very similar to that of the Z domain.20 Folding thermodynamics of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq The CD thermal denaturation profiles (Figure 2) were fitted to equation (1) and thermal stability was also studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; Figure 3). Thermodynamic data are summarized in Table 1, where it is also compared to data for ZSPA-1, the Z domain, and the E domain of staphylococcal protein A (SPA). The fitting of CD data involves optimization of at least six variables, but four of these are well-determined by the long pre- and post-transitional CD base lines. The H°unfold(TM) values obtained for ZTaq and antiZTaq (39­40 and ca 38 kcal mol-1, respectively) are to some extent dependent on the inclusion of the heat capacity term (C°P,unfold  0) in equation (1), but similar values (40 and 36 kcal mol-1, respectively) are obtained when the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data are fit to a two-state unfolding model. The inclusion of C°P,unfold  0 yields physically reasonable values for the heat capacity change (0.5(±0.3) and 0.9(±0.2) kcal mol-1 K-1 for ZTaq and anti-ZTaq, respectively) and it improves the fits of the CD data, but the improvement is not statistically significant. However, the same value of C°P,unfold = 0.5 kcal mol-1 K-1 for ZTaq is obtained from the DSC data, which then lends it

some further credibility. A reliable DSC value of C°P,unfold for anti-ZTaq could not be obtained due to base line uncertainties. The difference in C°P,unfold of the two proteins obtained from CD melting curves is also not statistically significant. The thermodynamics of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq unfolding is in both cases more similar to that of the originating Z domain and the E domain of SPA than to the ZSPA-1 affibody (Table 1). Binding thermodynamics Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was carried out in the temperature range 13 °C to 34 °C (Table 2) at buffer conditions identical to those used for thermal stability measurements and structure determination (20 mM KPi, 50 mM NaCl (pH 6.4)). A representative ITC titration is shown in Figure 4 and the data are summarized in Table 2. ZTaq:anti-ZTaq complex formation occurs with 1:1 stoichiometry (n = 0.96 ± 0.04), as expected. The binding affinity is not very temperature dependent and the dissociation constant ranges from Kd = 0.06 M at 13 °C to Kd = 0.11 M at 34 °C. The calorimetric enthalpy (HITC) is favourable (exothermic), and values range from ­3.7 kcal mol-1 to ­13.9 kcal mol-1 in the interval 13 °C to 34 °C. Control experiments show that it is independent on protein concentration in the range 6 M to 28 M (results not shown). Experiments at 25 °C and 30 °C were also performed in an alternative N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonate (ACES) buffer with a different ionization enthalpy (+7.5 kcal mol-1) than the phosphate buffer (+1.2 kcal mol-1) to detect any net changes in the protonation of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq on binding. However, the observed binding enthalpy is buffer

ca 0.05 H+, but the corresponding difference is not observed at 30 °C. The calorimetric enthalpy is a linear function of temperature between 13 °C and 27 °C, but a slight

non-linearity is apparent at temperatures above 30 °C (Figure 5). We attribute the non-linear behaviour to coupled protein folding and binding, as described.14 The fraction of unfolded protein is very small also at 34 °C, only on the order of 1 % (Table 2), but the large folding enthalpies make also such a small fraction detectable by ITC. The protein unfolding parameters given in Table 1 were therefore used to obtain corrected H°bind values. The corrections are negligible at lower temperatures and amount to +1 kcal mol-1 (H°bind = ­12.9 kcal mol-1) at 34 °C. This value corresponds to the coupled folding of 1.4 % of ZTaq and 1.2% of antiZTaq, with folding enthalpies of ­39.2 and ­38.6 kcal mol-1, respectively. The corrected binding enthalpies were fitted to obtain the binding heat capacity C°P,bind = ­0.43(±0.01) kcal mol-1 K-1 and H°bind (25 °C) = ­9.0(±0.1) kcal mol-1. The effect of the uncertainty associated with the C°P,unfold values in Table 1 on the determined H°bind and C°P,bind values was investigated and found to be negligible. The effect of coupled folding on the determined dissociation constants is negligible at temperatures below 25 °C and less than 2% at 34 °C. The binding entropy is ­TS°bind (25 °C) = ­0.6 kcal mol-1. The binding thermodynamics have been summarized and compared to that of the Z:ZSPA-1 complex in Table 3. The observed binding entropy is small, whereas a large and favourable desolvation entropy would be expected due to the non-polar character of the interacting surfaces and the observed heat capacity change. Hence, it is clear that the binding entropy is a result of balancing desolvation and configurational effects and these may be quantfied as follows. The experimental binding heat capacity corresponds to a desolvation entropy, ­TS°solv = ­33(±1) kcal mol-1 according to equation (4). The binding entropy can then be further dissected according to equation (3). Assuming a small value for the change in rotational and translational entropy of S°rt = ­8 cal mol-1 K-1 (corresponding to ­TS°rt = 2.4 kcal mol-1 at 25 °C) we obtain an estimate of the change in conformational entropy ­TS°conf  30 kcal mol-1. An alternative value S°rt = ­24 cal mol-1 K-1 representing

an upper limit of the effect, as discussed below, would yield ­TS°conf  25 kcal mol-1. This binding entropy dissection is also summarized in Table 3. Structure-based thermodynamics calculations The structures of ZTaq, anti-ZTaq, and the ZTaq:antiZTaq complex15 were used with the parameterization of changes in accessible surface area (ASA) employed by Lavigne et al.21 to calculate the binding thermodynamics and the results were compared to experimental data (Table 3). The heat capacity change C°P,bind obtained from ITC experiments is in good agreement with the ASA-based value: ­373(±62) cal mol-1 K-1. This theoretical value is composed of a non-polar contribution of ­486 cal mol-1 K-1 and a polar contribution of +113 cal mol-1 K-1. There are, however large differences between experimental values of H°bind and ­TS°conf and those obtained from the calculations (Table 3). The experimental H°bind = ­9 kcal mol-1 is much more favourable than the predicted value (8.6(±6.1) kcal mol-1). The predicted ­TS°bind value is large and favourable at 25 °C (­16 to ­21 kcal mol-1), which is in disagreement with the experimental value, ­TS°bind = ­0.6 kcal mol-1. The fact that the experimental dissociation constant Kd is predicted with an accuracy of within a factor of 102 can be attributed to balancing discrepancies in the calculations, which are discussed below.

Discussion
Affibody folding and stability The thermal stabilities of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq are lower than that of the Z domain, but considerably higher than that of the naturally occurring and homologous E domain of SPA (Table 1). CD and DSC thermal melting data also suggest that the unfolding thermodynamics of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq resemble that of the Z domain rather than that of the molten-globule-like ZSPA-1 affibody. The structures

of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq show packed hydrophobic cores.15 The denaturation of these is expected to result in a measurable heat capacity change. We could not determine completely unambiguous CP°unfold values, but CD and DSC data for ZTaq suggest a value (0.5 kcal mol-1 K-1) similar to that of the Z domain (ca 0.4 kcal mol-1 K-1). Calculated values of ZTaq and anti-ZTaq unfolding free energies (G°unfold) at ambient temperatures are somewhat uncertain due to the imprecision in CP°unfold. For ZTaq we obtain G°unfold = 3.0 to 3.7 kcal mol-1 at 25 °C (depending on the actual CP°unfold), which is larger than that of ZSPA-1 (G°unfold  1.5 kcal mol-1), but smaller than that of the Z domain (G°unfold  5 kcal mol-1).14 The structures and unfolding thermodynamics demonstrate that the extensive mutation of the Z domain surface in affibody proteins not necessarily impairs the structural integrity of the domain or leads to a significant destabilization. In fact, two of the three affibody proteins that we have studied (ZTaq and anti-ZTaq) can be considered as ``wellbehaving'' with regard to their structural and biophysical properties, whereas one (ZSPA-1) is severely destabilized. These statistics, though limited, indicate that protein properties are not likely to be a serious problem for the use of affibody proteins as engineered binding proteins. Binding enthalpy and heat capacity change The binding reaction is exothermic and the sign and magnitude of H°bind are typical for protein­ protein complexes.22 There are no protonation or deprotonation linkage effects and this is in accordance with the appearance of the binding interface, where for instance no salt bridges are observed.

The value of the heat capacity change, Cp°,bind = ­0.43 kcal mol-1 K -1 is consistent with the hydrophobic character of the interaction surface, where 70% of the total buried surface area is nonpolar. There are empirical parameterizations of protein unfolding thermodynamics in terms of changes in ASA of polar and non-polar groups,23­28 and it has been argued that these relations also apply for protein binding.29,30 The agreement between experimental data on protein binding and calculations using ASA-based parameterizations is in some cases very good.21,31 In the present case, the calculations reproduce the heat capacity change. However, the contribution to favourable binding enthalpy is seriously underestimated in the calculations. We would not like to attribute the discrepancy to errors in carefully calibrated parameters of the ASA analysis. Instead we suggest that it, to a large extent, might be due to the binding interactions made by Arg35 in ZTaq. This side-chain is buried within a tight groove on anti-Z Taq where it makes four (charged) hydrogen bonds within an otherwise non-polar environment. Such a highly unusual interaction for which a very favourable enthalpy component can be expected is potentially not accounted for in the formulae used in ASA-based calculations, which require that enthalpy changes are determined by desolvation effects. If this is the case, then Arg35 hydrogen bonding is a major contributor to the measured binding enthalpy. Dissecting the entropic contributions The binding entropy term, ­TS°bind = ­0.6 kcal mol-1, is small at 25 °C. However, given the large buried surface area and the measured heat capacity change it should contain a very favourable contribution from desolvation effects. Hence, with the observed entropy, configurational and solvation

entropies must be compensating each other almost exactly. We estimate ­TS°solv = ­33 (±1) kcal mol-1 based on the measured heat capacity change29,32,33 and ­TS°solv = ­33 (±4) kcal mol -1 based on changes in polar and non-polar ASA.21,27 Hence, to account for ­TS°bind we need to invoke balancing contributions, which in the absence of protonation or poly-electrolyte effects consist of conformational and translation/rotational entropy changes. There exists some uncertainty with regard to the value of the change in rotational and translational entropy, S°rt, for complex formation in water solution, although it is generally agreed that values calculated using gas-phase statistical mechanics significantly overestimates the contribution.34­39 Experimental and computational estimates for protein interactions range from ca. ­10 cal mol-1 K-1 (Yu et al.34) to values that are two to three times larger.35,36 Values from experimental studies of protein dimerization appear to fall closer to the smaller estimate.34 However, a recent theoretical study in which a generalized Bjerrum approach is used to calculate binding free energies, which are impressive in their agreement with experimental values, yields values of ­TS°rt  7 kcal mol-1 (S°rt  ­24 cal mol-1 K-1) for two protein­ligand complexes.38 This study also emphasizes that the value of S°rt depends on the nature and the strength of binding. In consideration of the uncertainty in S°rt we tabulate the experimental entropy balance and ASA-based calculated entropies for S°rt = ­8 cal mol-1 K-1 and S°rt = ­24 cal mol -1 K -1 , which would represent plausible upper and lower limits according to available experimental and theoretical evidence. These values correspond to ­TS°rt = 2.4 kcal mol-1 and ­TS°rt = 7.2 kcal mol-1 at 25 °C (Table 3).

It is clear that the precise value of S°rt has some influence on entropy balances in Table 3 as well as on the agreement between these and experimental data. Nevertheless, we find that the conformational entropy penalty must be large: ­TS°conf = 25 to 30 kcal mol-1. This value is unexpected given the well-folded appearance of the two subunits: considerable conformational freedom apparently still exists in the free state of one or both of the affibody proteins. This source of entropy can possibly be revealed by further NMR relaxation and hydrogen exchange experiments. A comparison of the entropy balance and the surface-areabased entropy calculations further suggest that the contributions to conformational entropy in equation (6) have been underestimated in our calculations. Comparison with the Z:ZSPA-1 complex The binding thermodynamics of the Z:ZSPA-1 complex was investigated previously.14 Overall, the two affibody complexes are comparable with respect to binding energetics at 25 °C: the binding enthalpies are favourable, the heat capacity change values are similar, and the binding entropies in both cases include a large favourable solvation entropy change that is counter-balanced by an almost equally large unfavourable conformational entropy change (Table 3). There are, however, some differences which can potentially be rationalized. It is, for instance, possible that the more favourable binding enthalpy for ZTaq:anti-ZTaq is due to the different nature of the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and in particular the four backbone hydrogen bonds made by the guanidino group of Arg35 in ZTaq. On the other hand, this cannot be definitely concluded, since the strength of hydrogen bonds vary

1312 significantly depending on geometry and local dielectric constant, as well as the desolvation enthalpy. The somewhat larger C°P,bind value that is observed in ZTaq:anti-ZTaq, might be attributed to the different interface surface area composition discussed above and in the accompanying paper.15 A major conclusion in our thermodynamic analysis of the Z:ZSPA-1 complex14 was that binding in this case is opposed by a large conformational entropy penalty. This penalty was calculated and/or measured in three different ways yielding values for ­TS°conf of 16 kcal mol-1 (from measured helix content) ca 20 kcal mol-1 (from surface-area-based calculations) and 23 kcal mol -1 (from entropy balance). Here, we calculate a value from the entropy balance on the order of ­TS°conf = 25 to 30 to kcal mol-1 for ZTaq:anti-ZTaq. The fact that this is even larger than for Z:ZSPA-1, even though both the complex and the free components are more stable is surprising, and must be attributed to uncertainties in the calculations as well as a general lack of understanding of compensating desolvation and conformational entropy effects in protein­ protein interactions. On the origin and further improvements of binding affinity The ZTaq:anti-ZTaq binding affinity with a dissociation constant of Kd = 100 nM is not as high as in many naturally occurring protein­protein complexes, and in particular antibody­antigen complexes, where picomolar to nanomolar affinities are frequently encountered.22 Affibody proteins with substantially higher binding affinities have also been identified. 6,17 Even though the present studies show how recognition and high-affinity binding in the ZTaq:anti-ZTaq complex occurs, it is unfortunately not clear in which way even higher affinity can be gained. As with the Z:ZSPA-1 complex, we cannot identify obvious discrepancies in the structure. A comparison between ZTaq:antiZTaq and other protein­protein complexes15 shows that the interaction surface area of 1670 Å2 lies in the range of what is typical for protein­protein complexes (1600(±400) Å2) and this also applies for the number of interface heavy atoms.18 We identify 11 intermolecular hydrogen bonds (and two potential aliphatic hydrogen bonds) in ZTaq: anti-ZTaq, and this number is within the average range (10.1 ± 4.8).18 In addition, binding energetics show that the desolvation entropy and binding enthalpy contributions both are large and favourable in accordance with the structure. Hence, the remaining contributor to be optimized again appears to be the change in conformational entropy, which unfortunately remains poorly characterized. Further studies of protein­protein interactions aimed at isolation and quantification of conformational entropy in proteins and protein­ protein complexes might therefore provide additional insight that can be of use for the engineering of binding proteins. In addition, one might use

structural and thermodynamic data of the nature and quality that we have provided for further theoretical development, such as the computational generalized Bjerrum approach recently suggested by Luo & Sharp.38

Materials and Methods
Proteins Protein expression and purification has been described.40 The concentration of ZTaq was determined spectrophotometrically with an extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 104 M-1 cm-1 at 280 nm, whereas the concentration of anti-ZTaq was determined by amino acid analysis or by the absorbance at 205 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.7 × 105 M-1 cm-1.41,42 All experiments were carried out in 50 mM NaCl and 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer a (pH 6.4), unless otherwise is stated. Circular dichroism spectroscopy Circular dichroism was measured on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with a Peltier temperature controller (Jasco-PTC 423S) and converted to mean residue ellipticity (MRE). Typical protein concentrations were 20­25 M in a 0.1 cm cuvette. Thermal unfolding was monitored at 222 nm using a heating rate of 5 deg. C min-1. It was quantified assuming a two-state unfolding equilibrium for which the Gibb's free energy difference (G°unfold) is given by: ÀRTlnðKunfold ðT ÞÞ ¼ DG-unfold TÞ ð  T À DC-P;unfold ¼ DH-unfold ðTM Þ Â 1 À   TM T Â TM À T þ Tln TM

ð1Þ

where TM is the melting temperature (G°unfold(TM) = 0), H°unfold is the enthalpy change and C°P,unfold is assumed to be temperature independent. The equilibrium constant Kunfold(T) is given by the temperaturedependent fraction unfolded peptide, funfold, as Kunfold = funfold/(1 - funfold) where funfold is calculated from MRE data as funfold = ([]obs - []N)/([]U - []N). MRE base lines for native (N) and unfolded (U) protein were assumed to be linear so that []N (T) = aN + bNT and []U (T) = aU + bUT. Parameter fitting was carried out as described.14 The post-transitional base line slope (bU) was treated as a common variable in a simultaneous (global) fit of the two data sets. The adequacy of including a C°P  0 term in equation (1) was evaluated using F-test statistics.43 Differential scanning calorimetry The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of 50 M protein samples was recorded on a VP-DSC (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA, USA) with a cell volume of 0.5208 ml. The heating rate was 60 deg. C h-1 and data were collected from 20 °C to 90 °C. Duplicate scans were recorded, after which the DSC profiles were base line corrected, and normalized to protein concentration. DSC data was fitted to determine TM, H°unfold(TM), and C°P,unfold for two-state protein unfolding (model equivalent to equation (1)), and two base line parameters using software supplied by Microcal Inc.

Thermodynamics of Affibody:Affibody Complex Formation Fluorescence spectroscopy 8-Anilino-1-naphtalenesulfonate (ANS) fluorescence was measured at room temperature on a PerkinElmer Luminescence Spectrometer, model LS50B. Solutions typically contained 40 M ANS and 20­40 M protein. Isothermal titration calorimetry ITC experiments were carried out using VP-ITC and MCS-ITC titration microcalorimeters (MicroCal Inc.). The protein solutions were dialyzed extensively in the same beaker and carefully de-gassed prior to use. Anti-ZTaq at concentrations ranging from 66 M to 275 M was injected into the cell, which contained 6 M to 28 M ZTaq. A typical experiment involved a preliminary 5 l injection followed by 24 injections of 10 l. Base line correction and integration were performed using the Origin software package (MicroCal Inc.). Heats of dilution were taken under consideration by subtracting the average of the heats observed at the end of the titration. (This procedure was verified by dilution experiments.) Non-linear leastsquares methods included in the Origin software package were used to fit the data to determine the calorimetric enthalpy (HITC) and the dissociation constant (Kd). The binding stoichiometry (n) was also treated as a variable. Calorimetrically determined enthalpies were corrected for ZTaq and anti-ZTaq folding to obtain the binding enthalpy H°bind as: DH-bind ¼ DH ITC À ðf unfold DH-fold ÞZTaq À ðf unfold DH-fold ÞantiÀZTaq

1313
The binding entropy may, in the absence of protonation effects (vide infra), be divided as: DS-bind ðTÞ ¼ DS-solv ðTÞ þ DS-conf þ DS-rt ð3Þ

where S°solv represents the change in solvation entropy, S°conf is the change in conformational entropy, and S°rt, accounts for the change in translational and rotational entropy. An experimental estimate of S°solv may be obtained as:29,32,33  DS-solv ¼ DC-P;bind Â ln  T 385 ð4Þ

which is based on the assumption that the entropy of desolvation of both polar29 and non-polar32 groups are zero at 385 K. The solvation entropy can also be calculated in terms of changes in ASA of polar (ASApol) and nonpolar atoms27 (ASAnp) as following:   T À 0:26 DS-solv ðT Þ ¼ 0:45 Â DASAnp Â ln 385:15   T Â DASApol Â ln 335:15

ð5Þ

The conformational entropy change can be decomposed into three terms as proposed by Murphy et al.:45 DS-conf ¼ DS-buYex þ DS-exYu þ DS-bb ð6Þ

where the fraction unfolded protein was calculated from stability data using standard relationships and H°fold = ­H°unfold. The binding heat capacity C°P,bind and H°bind(25 °C) were determined from a linear fit of experimental H°bind(T). The binding entropy term ­TS°bind(25 °C) was determined using these values in a fit of ­RTln(1/Kd) as a function of temperature (using the 1 M standard state).14 All experimental binding parameters and thermodynamics quantities were determined based on macromolecular concentrations, neglecting the non-ideality of the solutions. They are therefore only relevant at the specified buffer and concentration conditions. NMR spectroscopy The NMR samples of free ZTaq and anti-ZTaq contained 1.2 mM and 1.5 mM 13C,15N-labelled protein, respectively, in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4), 50 mM NaCl, with 10% (v/v) 2H2O, and 0.01 %(w/v) NaN3. 13Cdecoupled 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra (HSQC) were acquired at 25 °C using Bruker Avance 500 MHz and 600 MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with 5 mm triple resonance probes. Data were processed using NMRPipe.44 Structure-based thermodynamics We adopt the parameterization and procedures used by Lavigne et al.21 to obtain the surface-area based estimates of the binding enthalpy and heat capacity change, H°bind and C°P,bind.

in which S°buex represents the decrease in entropy of a side-chain when it becomes buried, S°ex-u is the reduction in conformational entropy of a side-chain when secondary structure elements form, and S°bb is the difference in backbone entropy upon binding. Values for S°buex, S°exu, and S°bb have been calculated for all the amino acids except for proline.27,46 In the calculation of S°conf, we set S°exu, and S°bb to zero for all residues except Lys4 and Phe5 in ZTaq, because they are disordered in the free state but become ordered in a helix conformation in the bound state.15 We use two alternative values of S°rt for reasons discussed in the text: the value S°rt = ­8 cal mol-1 K-1 and the larger S°rt = ­24 cal mol-1 K-1. The calculations were performed using the first 20 structural models in each of the pdb entries 2B87 (ZTaq: anti-ZTaq complex), 2B88 (unbound ZTaq), and 2B89 (unbound anti-ZTaq) resulting in 8000 (20 × 20 × 20) binding reactions. Surface areas were obtained using STC 5.0, 21 and NACCESS 2.1.1.
