Abstract Enzyme inhibition assays have the potential to rapidly screen and identify heavy metals in environmental samples. Inhibition of nitrate reductase (NR) was examined as a method for detecting toxic metals. The activity of NR (EC 1.6.6.2) from Aspergillus niger was assayed as a function of metal concentration in the presence of Cd2+ , Cr3+ , Cr6+ , Cu2+ , Ni2+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ . NR exhibited sensitivity to these metals at concentrations below 10 M. Various buffers were screened for their ability to protect NR activity from metal inhibition, and 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) was selected as the buffering system for the NR assays as it exhibited the least interference with metal inhibition, thus providing increased assay sensitivity. The hypothesis that chelating agents could prevent the inhibition of NR activity by metal ions was also tested. Results indicated that 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) could protect NR activity from inhibition by Cr3+ , Cu2+ , Cd2+ , Ni2+ , and Zn2+ at concentrations below 100 M, but that the EDTA had no effect on NR inhibition by Cr6+ . An amount of 10 mM nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) prevented NR inhibition by Cd2+ , Cu2+ , Ni2+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ at metal concentrations below 100 M. However, 10 mM NTA was unable to protect the enzyme from inhibition by either Cr3+ or Cr6+ . These results indicated that through specific metal chelation, a NR-based method for individually quantifying Cr3+ and Cr6+ species in aqueous solutions could be developed. The ability to restore activity to NR which been previously inhibited by exposure to 100 M Pb2+ , Cd2+ , Zn2+ , Cu2+ , and Cr3+ was explored to determine whether NR activity could be recovered by EDTA additions for use in consecutive metal inhibition assays. The results showed NR activity could not be regained after exposure to Cr3+ or Cu2+ , but did partially recover activity after Cd2+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ exposure.

globe. These metals are dangerous to human health when present in drinking water and food [1]. One of these metals, chromium, is the second most common inorganic contaminant at hazardous waste sites in the US [2], following only nitrate. In evaluating known or suspected sites of metal contamination or while conducting routine drinking water analyses, hundreds of samples may be taken for analysis, many of which

may not be contaminated. These samples are typically analyzed by traditional methods including inductively coupled plasma atomic electron spectrometry (ICP/AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or wet chemical methods. Traditional methods have detection limits ranging from parts per trillion to parts per billion, and while relatively accurate, can consume significant time and money, particularly when large numbers of samples require testing. Additionally these methods typically do not distinguish between metal valence state. For example, few methods are available to directly measure Cr6+ and Cr3+ concentrations in aqueous systems. To differentiate between Cr6+ and Cr3+ , samples must be first subjected to separation by ion-exchange followed by analysis with AAS or ICP techniques to individually determine Cr3+ and Cr6+ . Another common approach involves measurement of Cr6+ with a colorimetric technique, and total chromium by either by AAS, or ICP techniques. Cr3+ concentration is then inferred by subtraction [3]. Since the measurement of Cr3+ ultimately involves the use of ICP or AAS techniques, the development of an inexpensive method that could be used to speciate and quantify Cr3+ and Cr6+ would be beneficial. As a supplement to traditional techniques, biochemical means of analyzing soil and water samples, particularly enzymatic methods, are receiving increased attention [4­9]. Enzymatic assays have been shown to detect inhibitors such as heavy metals or pesticides with greater speed and economy than traditional analytical techniques due to the lower equipment cost, compact size, portability and rapid test times of enzymatic biosensors [4,10­13]. As it is, the enzyme that will ultimately determine assay sensitivity, enzyme selection is the first and most important step in developing a biochemical test for environmental contaminants. The activity of the enzyme or enzymes used must be sensitive to environmentally relevant species but, at the same time, show some specificity towards a particular inhibitor. The enzyme activity must also be sensitive to the contaminant over an environmentally significant concentration range. Additionally, the assay for enzymatic activity must be fast and relatively simple. One enzyme that meets these criteria for a variety of heavy metal cations is nitrate reductase (NR) [14­30].

Nitrate reductase (NR) is produced by a variety of animals, plants, and microorganisms including fungi. This enzyme is a homodimer composed of two identical subunits of approximately 100 kDa, each of which contains three cofactors, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), heme-iron (heme-Fe) and Mo-molybdopetrin (Mo-MPT) in a 1:1:1 ratio [31,32]. All known sequences of NR have been found to contain one conserved cystiene (Cys) residue that is located in the cytochrome b fragment of the enzyme [33]. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cytochrome b domain of corn leaf NADH:NR showed that this Cys residue is not essential for NADH binding or NADH:NR activity, but is essential for highly efficient catalytic transfer of electrons from the NAD(P)H to FAD [34]. It has also been determined that there are other key Cys residues present in most NR enzymes that are involved in binding the molybdopetrin as well as joining the enzyme subunits [32,35]. The presence of multiple Cys in NR lends it to be highly sensitive to inhibition by heavy metals because many of these metals, such as Cu and Pb, have high binding affinities for the thiol groups that are present in the Cys side chains [36]. Previous studies have shown NR to be highly sensitive to numerous heavy metals [14,17,18,23,30,37]. Although these studies have reported NR sensitivity to a variety of heavy metals, they have not focused on the potential for developing NR inhibition into a method for detecting metals. To date, no studies have examined the impact of a broad range of heavy metals on the activity of a NR from a single organism for the purpose of developing a biosensing device. Rather they have focused on the impact that such metals have on various higher plant's metabolisms, mechanisms of resistance to high metal concentrations by plants and specific mechanisms of NR inactivation by metals. Aspergillus niger produces an NAD(P)H bispecific form of assimilatory NR (EC 1.6.6.2) that catalyzes the reduction of NO3 - to NO2 - . Because this particular enzyme's activity could be rapidly determined by a colorimetric assay it was selected as a candidate for metal detection via enzymatic inhibition. To determine the extent to which this enzyme was sensitive to heavy metals in aqueous samples, the activity of purified A. niger NR was evaluated in the presence of Cd2+ , Cu2+ , Cr3+ , Cr6+ , Ni2+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ ions at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000 M. To explore the possibility of a selective means of metal

detection in aqueous samples, the ability of ethylenediaminetretraacetic acid (EDTA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) to form metal complexes and thus prevent NR inhibition by heavy metals was also investigated. As many biosensors make use of immobilized enzyme on a probe, the ability to reuse NR in repeated measurements of metal concentrations was investigated by using EDTA additions as a means of restoring enzymatic activity to previously inactivated NR.

using 1 N NaOH to adjust NTA and 3 M HCl to adjust EDTA. 2.2. Measurement of nitrate reductase activity Nitrate reductase activity was measured using the Griess reaction in which nitrite is colorimetrically determined by diazotization and diazomium coupling reactions of nitrite with sulfanilamide and N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine. Measurements were conducted in 96-well microtiter plates, allowing multiple reactions to be quantified simultaneously. The assay followed the method used by Kneer and Zenk [37] with modifications including the adaptation for use in a 96-well plate format, the reduction of the assay time to 5 min, and the substitution of a 12.5 mM MOPS buffer instead of the 33 mM Tris buffer used. The reaction was quenched with the addition of 40 l of 1% (wt.%) sulfanilamide in 3 M HCl, which was shown experimentally to completely halt the enzymatic reduction of nitrate by substantially lowering the pH of the assay solution (data not shown). This was followed by the addition of 40 l 0.2% (wt.%) N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine. The absorbance of the resulting pink solution read at 540 nm was recorded after 10 min using a microplate reader (HTS7000 Plus Bioassay Reader, Perkin-Elmer, CT, USA). Negative controls containing all reagents except nitrate reductase were run and analyzed for nitrite. Additional controls containing nitrite, nitrate reductase and NADPH were run as well to rule out the possibility that nitrate reductase could reduce the nitrite. 2.3. Evaluation of buffer­metal interactions To evaluate which buffer would provide minimal metal­buffer complexation and consequently allow maximal metal inhibition to NR activity, an analysis of various pH buffers was performed. HEPES, MOPS, PIPES, phosphate, and Tris buffers were individually evaluated in the presence NR and 5 M of each of the following metals: Cr3+ , Cr6+ , Cd2+ , Cu2+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ . An unbuffered assay system was used to establish a baseline of metal-induced enzyme inhibition. Reagents were added in the following order: the metal stock solution, the buffer solution, KNO3 solution, NR, and NADPH. For these particular

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals All chemicals were prepared using ultrapure water having a resistance of 18 M or greater which was stored in HCl washed glassware. The buffers used for metal inhibition tests were 4-2-hydroxyethly-1-piperazine ethansulfonic acid (HEPES) and 3-[N-morpholino] propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), which were obtained from Sigma; piperazine-N,N -bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES), which was obtained from Aldrich; and potassium phosphate monobasic/potassium phosphate dibasic and tris[hydroxymethyl] aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris), which were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Either 3 M HCl or 1 M NaOH was used to adjust the pH of the Tris, HEPES, MOPS and PIPES buffers to a pH of 7.5. The pH of the phosphate buffer was adjusted to 7.5 using a 100 mM solution of potassium phosphate monobasic. Purified Aspergillus niger NR (EC 1.6.6.2) was obtained from Sigma, and was prepared fresh each day in a 0.35 mg ml-1 stock solution (approximately 0.25 units ml-1 ) which was buffered with 30 mM MOPS buffer at a pH of 7.5. Nicotinamide adenine dinulceotide phosphate (NADPH), which was also obtained from Sigma, was prepared fresh daily at a concentration of 0.35 mM in a 30 mM MOPS buffer at pH 7.5. KNO3 was obtained from Fisher Scientific. The following metal salts were used to prepare heavy metal stock solutions: Cd2 Cl4 ·5H2 O, CuCl2 ·2H2 O, CrCl3 ·6H2 O, NiCl2 ·6H2 O, PbCl2 , ZnCl2 , and K2 Cr2 O7 . Stock solutions of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (EDTA) from Sigma and Fisher Scientific, respectively, were prepared and adjusted to a pH of 7.5

experiments, NR and NADPH solutions were prepared in water rather than the 30 mM MOPS, as was done for all other experiments. The final concentration of all reagents were 30 mM of each respective buffer, 5 M metal, 50 g ml-1 NR, 10 mM KNO3 , and 0.1 mM NADPH. As described above, NADPH addition initiated the reaction, but NR activity was determined following the method of Gilliam et al. [38], which is based on the rate of NADPH disappearance. The presence of NADPH, which has a peak absorbance at 340 nm was monitored with respect to time for 3 min using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Nitrate reductase activity was then reported as a ratio of the change in absorbance of a metal containing test to the change in absorbance of a positive (metal-free) control. The inherent instability of NADPH and the potential for oxidation in the presence of the metals used in these experiments was accounted for in negative controls which contained all reagents but NR. 2.4. Measurement of metal inhibition Nitrate reductase, NADPH, and KNO3 were used in the same concentrations as in the metal-free NR and buffer evaluation assays. For metal inhibition studies in the absence of a chelating agent, the appropriate concentration of metal stock solution was added to the NR enzyme and nitrate solution. The mixture was allowed to incubate at 25  C for 5 min prior to the addition of NADPH to allow adequate time for metal­enzyme interaction. A 12.5 mM MOPS buffer solution was used to maintain the pH at 7.5. Final metal concentrations in the assay solution ranged from 0.01 to 1000 M. Enzyme activity was evaluated as described above by the colorimetric quantification of nitrite production and reported as a percentage of the nitrite produced in a metal-free control. 2.5. EDTA and NTA chelation experiments For experiments in which either EDTA or NTA was used as a chelating agent, reagents were added in the following order: the appropriate metal solution, EDTA or NTA, NR, nitrate, and finally NADPH. To allow sufficient time for the metal and chelator to react, the metal and either EDTA or NTA were added together prior to the addition of NR. Final assay metal

ion concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 1000 M and EDTA and NTA had final concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 mM. Final concentrations of NR enzyme, KNO3 , and NADPH were as described above. Nitrate reductase activity was assayed by monitoring the production of nitrite as detailed above. 2.6. Nitrate reductase regeneration To determine if the inactivation caused by metal exposure could be reversed by EDTA, NR was exposed to 100 M of the following metals: Cd2+ , Cr3+ , Cu2+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ for 5 min in a 96-well plate and incubated at 25  C with KNO3 . After 5 min, 10 mM EDTA was added and solutions were shaken for 10 s. NADPH was added to sets of positive controls, negative controls, and metal/enzyme and EDTA for evaluation of NR activity both immediately after EDTA addition and 30 min after EDTA addition. Enzyme activity was measured by determining the amount of nitrite produced and reported as a percent of a positive control. 2.7. Statistical analysis Both positive and negative controls were performed for each set of experiments. Positive controls contained no heavy metals, but contained all other reagents, while negative controls contained all reagents except NR. NR activity is reported as a percentage of the experimentally measured activity of the positive (metal-free) control. All data points represent the average of seven replicate experiments and the error bars represent the standard deviations of those points.

3. Results To select a buffering system that allowed for maximum inhibition of the enzyme by heavy metal ions, several common buffers, HEPES, MOPS, PIPES, phosphate, and Tris were used in metal inhibition assays (Fig. 1). Experimental results showed that the buffer used in the assay affected the sensitivity of NR to the metal ions examined due to some of the buffers' apparent ability to chelate metal ions. NR activity assays were also run in an unbuffered water system to

establish a baseline level of metal sensitivity and to determine if the buffers were shielding NR from inhibition by any of the metals examined. An unbuffered assay system was not selected for further experiments because the pH could not be uniformly maintained for the various conditions under which NR activity would be measured. When compared to unbuffered water, it was observed that the MOPS buffer did not preferentially bind the metal species examined and thus MOPS was chosen for use in subsequent metal inhibition assays over a wider range of metal concentrations. Phosphate and Tris buffers appeared to selectively protect NR against different metals (Fig. 1). In a phosphate buffered system, NR activity was inhibited by Cu2+ ions while NR activity was relatively insensitive to Cd2+ , Cr6+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ . The opposite was found when the assay was conducted in a Tris buffered system where NR was insensitive to Cu2+ ions and was inhibited by Cd2+ , Cr6+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ . NR activity was measured in presence of 0.01­ 1000 M of Cd2+ , Cr3+ , Cr6+ , Cu2+ , Ni2+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ . These experiments were run using a MOPS

buffer as it did not protect NR activity from the metals used in this study when compared to the other buffers. Results showed that NR activity was inhibited over a small range of Pb2+ , Zn2+ , and Cd2+ metal ion concentrations as seen in Fig. 2. NR showed less sensitivity to Ni2+ and was not adversely affected by this metal ion until a concentration of over 100 M. Even at 1000 M Ni2+ , the enzyme still retained nearly 20% of its original activity (Fig. 3). With the exceptions of Cr6+ and Cu2+ , NR activity was not significantly affected by exposure to metal concentrations <2 M, above which NR activity decreased rapidly with increasing metal ion concentration and was almost completely inhibited by 10 M concentrations of all metals tested other than Ni2+ . Both Cu2+ and Cr6+ inhibited NR activity at concentrations below 1 M with the enzyme inhibition of 76 and 62% at concentrations of 1 M Cu2+ and Cr6+ , respectively (Fig. 4). To determine the ability of metal chelators to prevent NR inhibition, EDTA and NTA were added to the enzymatic assay. As shown in Fig. 5, 10 mM EDTA protected NR activity for all metal ions examined in this study up to metal concentrations of 100 M

with the exception of Cr6+ . Cr3+ was susceptible to chelation by 10 mM EDTA (Fig. 5), and thus unavailable to inhibit NR at a concentration up to 100 M Cr3+ . In contrast, the ability of Cr6+ to inhibit NR was virtually unaffected by the presence of EDTA over the concentration range tested (Fig. 6). NTA was

found to protect NR at a concentration of 10 mM from metal-induced inhibition when added to the assay mixture concurrently with the metal stock solutions of Zn2+ , Cu2+ up to 100 M, Pb2+ and Cd2+ , but did not protect the enzyme from exposure to Cr3+ or Cr6+ (Fig. 7).

To explore the hypothesis that metal-induced inhibition could be reversed, 10 mM EDTA was added to solutions of NR, 10 mM nitrate and 100 M of Cu2+ , Cd2+ , Cr3+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ that had been incubated at 25  C for 5 min prior to the addition of the EDTA. The addition of EDTA partially restored activity to NR that had been exposed to Zn2+ ,

Pb2+ , and Cd2+ , but was unable to significantly restore NR activity when exposed to either Cu2+ or Cr3+ (Table 1). The recovery of enzymatic activity after exposure to Cr6+ ions via EDTA chelation was not attempted, since EDTA was unable to protect NR from Cr6+ inhibition in previous experiments.

4. Discussion The enzymatic activity of NR showed a sharp sensitivity to Cr3+ , Cd2+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ over a range of 1­10 M metal ion, while Cu2+ and Cr6+ inhibited the activity of NR across several orders of magnitude. These results concur with prior work, which found

that A. niger NR activity was almost completely inactivated by Cd2+ and Zn2+ at concentrations above 2 M [17]. Cu2+ and Cr6+ were the most potent inhibitors of NR substantially inhibiting activity at concentrations of 1 M. Related studies on squash cotyledon NR [30], wheat NR [23] and NR from metal resistant populations of Silene cucubalus [14]

also found Cu2+ was inhibitory to the enzyme at concentrations at least an order of magnitude lower than other metals tested such as Zn2+ , Pb2+ , and Cd2+ . The NR from A. niger used in this study began to show slight sensitivity to Cu2+ at concentrations as low as 0.01 M Cu2+ (Fig. 9) whereas the NR enzymes used other experiments [14,23] could tolerate Cu2+ at concentrations of at least an order of magnitude greater. Several mechanisms by which metals inhibit the activity of NR have been proposed. Two of these suggested mechanisms include: (i) metal binding to sulfhydryl groups that are involved in the structural integrity of the enzyme or catalytic action; and (ii) the induced deficiency of the essential metal in the metalloprotein or metal protein complex (in the case of NR, the Mo-MTP) with the eventual substitution of the toxic metal for the deficient element [39]. Additionally, it is thought that metal-induced enzyme inhibition could be due to the generation of radical oxygen species through a series of Fenton-type reactions, which in turn can denature the enzyme by causing conformational changes in its secondary and/or tertiary structure [26,40]. As NR is known to be a cysteine rich protein, and contains an invariant Cys residue, most attribute the loss of enzymatic activity in the presence of heavy metal ions to the alteration of the ­SH group on this amino acid [14,16,18,20,22,23,27,29,30,41­43]. It was later deduced by site-directed mutagenesis that there is an invariant Cys residue which is not essential for the binding of NADH but rather it aids in the positioning of NADH, for optimal electron transfer to the FAD and eventually on to the nitrate reducing site [34]. This Cys residue, which is conserved amongst known sequences of NR, is most likely the primary site of metal binding and subsequent inactivation.

Luna et al. [23] found that NR from wheat leaf segments incubated with both 25 and 100 M of Cu2+ for 15 min at 25  C and then treated with 1 mM EDTA for 10 min could recover up to 90% of its original activity. These results differ from those presented here and those reported by Smarrelli and Campbell [30]. In the results presented here, it was found that Cu2+ inactivation could not be reversed by subsequent addition of up to 10 mM EDTA (Table 1), however if EDTA and Cu2+ were present prior to the addition of the enzyme, activity of the NR was protected by the metal chelation properties of the EDTA (Fig. 5). Both of these results concur with that of Smarrelli and Campbell [30]. This implies that there are two possibilities for the mode of Cu2+ inactivation of A. niger NR. The first is that Cu2+ has a higher binding affinity for ­SH groups present on NR than for EDTA. Another possible explanation is that Cu2+ causes a permanent change in enzyme conformation, which renders it inactive even after the removal of Cu2+ . To better understand metal toxicity, the following divalent metal ions have been classified by their increasing affinity for reacting with N and S ligands (affinity for N and S increasing from left to right): Zn2+ , Ni2+ , Co2+ , Cd2+ , Cu2+ , and Pb2+ [36]. Pb2+ has a strong affinity for ­SH groups where Zn2+ is known to have more affinity for carboxyl groups. In spite of this, Pb2+ did not inhibit NR activity at nanomolar concentrations as was found with Cu2+ . Additionally, NR that had previously been exposed to Pb2+ ions recovered approximately 40% of the original NR activity after incubation with EDTA, while Cu2+ and Cr3+ exposure appears to leave the enzyme irreversibly inactivated. Results similar to Pb2+ were found for Cd2+ , another metal with moderate affinity for ­SH ligands. Enzyme exposed to high concentrations of Cd2+ ions could, after EDTA addition, recover nearly 30% of the original NR activity when compared to a positive control. This suggests that Zn2+ , Pb2+ , and Cd2+ may inhibit A. niger NR by a different mechanism than does Cu2+ , although this mechanism has yet to be elucidated. Like Cu2+ , Cr6+ also inhibited NR at concentrations below 1 M. EDTA chelated all metals examined with the exception of Cr6+ , effectively making the NR sensitive only to Cr6+ in the presence of EDTA. Similarly NTA preserved NR activity in the presence of all metals except Cr3+ and Cr6+ . This slight, but critical

difference between EDTA and NTA indicates a potential to use this NR to quantify total chromium present in a sample and provide a means of speciating the two oxidation states in a potentially viable biosensing application. This could bypass the need for expensive testing via ICP/MS, providing a rapid, and potentially cost effective means of quantifying Cr3+ ions in solution for screening applications. Traditionally, Cr6+ concentrations can be measured directly via colorimetric techniques and total chromium present in a sample is determined via ICP/

MS or AAS. The concentration of Cr3+ must then be calculated by difference. Because NR is sensitive to Cr3+ ions, it may be possible to measure Cr3+ present in clean aqueous samples. In addition to increasing the selectivity of NR inhibition, the use of chelating agents such as EDTA or NTA can provide a way to increase the concentration range over which NR or other enzymes show sensitivity to metals. As seen in Fig. 8, the addition of 10 mM EDTA increased the concentration range over which Cr3+ inhibited NR by two orders of magnitude. By altering the concentrations of various chelators in the enzymatic assay, a wider range of metal concentrations could be quantified for a sample containing a single metal species as exemplified in Fig. 8 for Cr3+ using EDTA and in Fig. 9 for Cu2+ using NTA. It may by possible through the use of an array of chelating agents to use this enzymatic assay specifically for quantifying metals in water samples. Such a method of detection would be useful in large scale routine screening of drinking water samples or industrial process streams in which the majority of the contents are known. When considering the high cost and time spent processing multiple samples using traditional techniques such as ICP/MS and AAS, the need for a rapid initial screening process becomes apparent. The detection of various heavy metals and contaminants via enzymatic inhibition has the potential to screen a large volume of samples for contamination,

pinpointing areas that need the sensitivity and accuracy that can be attained using ICP/MS and AAS. Screening large numbers of samples via enzymatic inhibition will not only reduce testing time, but overall costs as well, as fewer samples will be ultimately tested using the traditional analytical techniques. A comparable urease inhibition-based method for rapidly determining the concentration and presence of heavy metal contaminants was developed [44]. Urease was found to be sensitive to Hg2+ > Cu2+ > Cr 6+ > Zn2+ = Cd2+ > Pb2+ in order of increasing sensitivity. Like the method proposed in this work, it uses a colorimetric assay to determine urease activity and provides a rapid, cost effective means of screening a large number of surface, ground or wastewater samples. The sensitivity of urease to Cd2+ , Zn2+ , and Pb2+ was about two orders of magnitude lower than the sensitivity provided by NR to those metals in this study. Both studies showed sensitivity to Cu2+ on the same order of magnitude and NR showed a several thousand fold higher sensitivity to Cr6+ than did urease. Also using the urease enzyme, a disposable cuvette method for the determination of heavy metals was developed [45]. This system uses free urease in a disposable cuvette, the walls of which have been coated with sensors for ammonia or ammonium ion thus allowing for the kinetics of the reaction to be monitored by tracking the color of the sensing layer. The metals examined in this assay include Ag1+ , Hg2+ , Cu2+ , Ni2+ , Co2+ , Cd2+ , Fe3+ , Zn2+ , and Pb2+ . Although the detection limits of the above urease assay are not as sensitive as those provided by NR, it has the advantage of being able to perform a colorimetric assay in samples that may vary substantially in turbidity or are strongly colored in their own right. Another study [46] found that the potential existed to use an array of five enzymes and four computer algorithms to determine a single pollutant in a sample. The computer algorithms exploit the non-specificity of the individual enzymatic response to pollutants and use them together as a group to determine the species of pollutant present. Through the use of the following enzymes; lactate dehydrogenase, phenylalanine dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase, it was possible to determine the presence of atrazine, phenol, pentachlorophenol and the heavy metals cadmium and chromium.

This differs from the approach suggested here in which a single enzyme, NR, is used with an array of chelating agents that may selectively chelate various species in a sample, leaving only one to inhibit the NR. The method proposed in this work has the advantage of a single enzymatic assay varying only the presence of chelating agents which may be easily adapted for use in a 96-well plate format as opposed to a method that requires multiple enzymatic assays and reagents.

5. Conclusions Nitrate reductase activity was found to be sensitive to a wide array of metal ions including Cd2+ , Cr3+ , Cr6+ , Cu2+ , Pb2+ , and Zn2+ at concentrations below 10 M. For use in biosensing applications, NR shows promise for metal contaminants in aqueous solutions. It provides a rapid assessment of inhibitor presence and concentration and can be used to detect individual metals in clean samples. The potential exists to develop metal-specific inhibition assays through the use of a metal chelator matrix as was demonstrated using NTA and EDTA for the detection of Cr3+ and Cr6+ . Additionally, the use of various concentrations of metal chelators in the NR activity assay can decrease the sensitivity of the enzyme to the metal inhibitor, which effectively increases the range of inhibitor concentrations to which the enzyme is sensitive. Although, additional development, such as determining the effects of multiple inhibitors as well as screening with environmental samples including ground water, is required before this technique is ready for widespread use, this method shows great promise as a supplementary sample screening procedure to determine if a more rigorous laboratory analysis is required.
