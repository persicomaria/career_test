Previous mutational studies on Tyr42R variants as well as the current studies on the mutant hemoglobin RY42A show that the intersubunit interactions associated with Tyr42R significantly stabilize the R1 2 interface of the quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on RY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42R have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the R1 2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42R do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy RY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37 , a critical region of the quaternary-T R1 2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin.
The quaternary structure of the R2 2 hemoglobin tetramer, an assembly of two identical R dimers, is very sensitive to ligation state. Several high-resolution crystallographic studies have shown that fully deoxygenated hemoglobin has virtually the same quaternary structure, the T quaternary structure, under high-salt and low-salt crystallization conditions (13). In contrast, fully liganded hemoglobin is characterized by an ensemble, the Re ensemble, of energetically similar but spatially distinct quaternary structures.1 Formation of the quaternary-T dimer-dimer interface in deoxyhemoglobin

The structures in this ensemble are spatially distributed over a range that varies between the quaternary-R (5) and quaternary-R2 (6) conformations. The symbol Re refers to this ensemble. Very recent NMR experiments have shown that the quaternary structure of liganded hemoglobin in solution also is best represented by an ensemble of energetically similar conformations with the average structure midway between the R and R2 conformations (7). In this paper, reference to the Re ensemble is synonymous with the term R-state used in most previous publications.

ABSTRACT:

dramatically decreases the oxygen affinity of the R- and -subunits several hundred-fold and results in a tetramer that exhibits positive cooperativity. Thus, at least some of the intersubunit interactions that define the quaternary-T dimerdimer interface must function as "quaternary constraints" that inhibit the binding of oxygen to the R- and -heme groups of the deoxygenated T quaternary state by opposing ligandinduced changes in T state structure. The classic two-state model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (8) states that initial ligand binding weakens the quaternary-T constraints and shifts the T-Re equilibrium in favor of the Re ensemble. In contrast, recent thermodynamic studies by Ackers et al. (9) suggest that the initial events associated with ligand binding disrupt quaternary-T constraints such that partially liganded hemoglobin adopts a high-affinity T-like structure. In particular, the data of Ackers et al. (9) reveal the existence of intradimer cooperativity within the T-like tetramer; i.e., binding a ligand to an R- or -subunit disrupts quaternary constraints associated with the unliganded subunit on the same R dimer, increasing its ligand affinity. Identifying the quaternary-T constraints and determining how liganded binding disrupts them are central to understanding hemoglobin's mechanism. Tyr42R forms an intersubunit hydrogen bond with Asp99 across the dimer-dimer interface in the quaternary-T tetramer, but not in the Re ensemble (4, 10). Therefore, this interaction was a reasonable candidate for an important quaternary-T constraint. Early support for this assignment came from studies on 99 mutants where a marked desta-

Structure-Function Studies of RY42A Hemoglobin bilization of the quaternary-T structure has been attributed to the absence of the Tyr42R-Asp99 hydrogen bond (11, 12). In the absence of potent allosteric effectors, many of these mutants are noncooperative, and it has been suggested that they are locked in the Re ensemble even when fully deoxygenated. The restoration of cooperativity in the noncooperative D99N mutant, Hb Kempsey, as the result of a second, compensatory RY42D mutation also has been cited as evidence of the critical nature of the Tyr42R-Asp99 hydrogen bond in wild-type deoxyhemoglobin (13, 14). Similarly, studies on the RY42F and RY42H mutants also yielded evidence in favor of the purported critical role played by the Tyr42R-Asp99 hydrogen bond. The key observation was that the noncooperative phenylalanine mutant cannot form the hydrogen bond whereas the cooperative histidine mutant is capable of forming the hydrogen bond, albeit at a much weaker level than in the wild-type protein (15-18). However, these results link the Tyr42R-Asp99 hydrogen bond only to the stability but not to the ligand affinity or to the conformation of the T state. In the study presented here, the RY42A2 mutant is studied and compared to the previously studied R42 mutants mentioned above. The replacement of tyrosine with the nonpolar alanine residue eliminates the potential for the hydrogen bond and introduces a nonpolar side chain that is much smaller and less interactive than amino acid side chains in the other two R42 mutants. Here we report X-ray crystallographic studies, visible and UV resonance Raman spectroscopic studies, and functional studies that show the deoxygenated RY42A mutant can form a quaternary-T tetramer, which both manifests key conformational elements associated with quaternary constraint and binds the ligand with only a moderately greater affinity than the deoxygenated T state of HbA. However, the removal of the phenolic group at R42 by the Ala substitution substantially destabilizes the deoxygenated T state, reducing the equilibrium constant for the assembly of two R dimers into a deoxygenated tetramer by 2000-fold. Unlike the RY42F variant, the RY42A variant binds oxygen cooperatively with an overall increase in affinity of only 3-fold. Therefore, the Tyr42R-Asp99 hydrogen bond and the other interactions associated with the phenolic side chain of Tyr42R make major contributions to the stability, but not the quaternary constraint, of the T quaternary structure of hemoglobin. MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis of the RY42A Mutant Hemoglobin. The RY42A mutation was created by cassette mutagenesis using a modified form of pUC18 in which a synthetic R-globin gene that uses optimum Escherichia coli codons was cloned between the XbaI and PstI sites of the polylinker region. The other restriction endonuclease recognition sites in the linker region of this plasmid (which was provided by R. Hernan and S. Sligar, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL) were eliminated to facilitate cassette mutagenesis. The RY42A mutation was introduced by replacing the AflII-BamHI cassette, which corresponds to R-globin residues 33-52, with a cassette that encoded alanine at position 42R. After

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 10, 2005 3807 transformation into competent DH5R cells, automated DNA sequencing (done at The University of Iowa College of Medicine DNA Core Facility) was used to identify plasmids that contained the RY42A mutation. The mutated R-globin gene was then cloned into the region between the XbaI and PstI sites of the pUC18-based R/ coexpression vector described by Hernan et al. (19). Constitutive coexpression of the R- and -globin genes in E. coli strain TB-1 did not produce sufficient quantities of the mutant hemoglobins; 136 L of bacterial culture yielded approximately 20 mg of tetrameric hemoglobin. Yields were increased significantly by cloning the entire R/ -globin operon into the T7 expression plasmid pET17b (Novagen, Madison, WI). Transformed E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was grown at 37 °C in LB medium (1 L of culture per 2.8 L Fernbach flask) containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin for 36 h with gentle shaking (60 rpm). The cells were not induced with IPTG because induction resulted in lower hemoglobin production. The mutant R-globin was isolated from the expressed hemoglobin, and a functionally homogeneous mutant hemoglobin was assembled from normal human -subunits, the R-globin, and hemin as described by Hui et al. (20). It should be noted that the RY42A hemoglobin also contains the RV1M mutation. Hui et al. (20) recently demonstrated that the RV1M mutation has no significant effect on the structural or functional properties of hemoglobin. Cross-Linking the RY42A Mutant between Lys99R1 and Lys99R2. In the past, we prepared -chain mutants crosslinked between residues Lys99R1 and Lys99R2 by combining the mutant -globin with hemin and cross-linked RR dimers (21). This method is unsuitable for the preparation of cross-linked R-chain mutants. Instead, the cross-linking reaction was carried out after preparation of the mutant hemoglobin from the R-globin, heme, and normal -subunits. The cross-linking procedure was based on that of Chatterjee et al. (22) and Snyder et al. (23), as described by Kwiatkowski et al. (21), but the scale was greatly reduced. A total of 13 mg of the RY42A mutant was concentrated to 1.6 mM in heme in 50 mM HCl bis-Tris (pH 7.2), and a 5-fold molar excess of IHP over Hb tetramer was added. This solution was deoxygenated for 1 h on ice under a nitrogen atmosphere and then placed in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min. An equal volume of deoxygenated 0.5 mM DBF in 0.2 M Hepes buffer (pH 7.2) was added anaerobically, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h with continuous gentle shaking for the last hour. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 1 M glycine (pH 9) to a final concentration of 0.2 M. The reaction mixture was kept at 37 °C for an additional 15 min and then placed on ice. After reaching 4 °C, the reaction mixture was quickly reoxygenated by being exposed to air. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a G-25F column equilibrated with 1 mM HCl Tris (pH 8.2), deionized by being passed through a Dintzis column (24), and fractionated by HPLC as previously described (21). Kinetics of CO Combination with Deoxygenated Hemoglobin. These kinetics were measured with an OLIS (On Line Instrument Systems Inc., Bogart, GA) USA stopped flow apparatus as described by Doyle et al. (25). Reactions were followed at 420 and 435 nm using a 1.7 cm path length cell at pH 7 and 20 °C. Concentrations of CO and hemoglobin (in heme equivalents) were 20 and 2 µM, respectively.

3808 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 10, 2005 Oxygen Equilibrium Measurements. These were carried out tonometrically as previously described (26). A 500 mL tonometer with an attached 2 mm cuvette was used. The Hb concentration was 200 µM in heme equivalents. Spectral measurements were carried out in a Cary 14 spectrophotometer modified by OLIS for computer control and on-line data acquisition. For these measurements, solutions contained, in addition to buffer and hemoglobin, the ferredoxin NADP reductase system of Hayashi et al. (27) for maintenance of the heme groups in their ferrous state. Visible Resonance Raman Spectra. The resonance Raman spectra of the equilibrium deoxy derivatives and the photoproducts of the CO-bound derivatives of HbA and RY42A were obtained using a Raman apparatus described in detail in ref 28. Briefly, Soret band-enhanced time-resolved Raman spectra were obtained using an 8 ns, 150 µJ, 435.8 nm pulse to both photodissociate the ligand (in the case of the CO derivatives) and to generate Raman scattering from the sample. A frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (NY81C-20, Continuum, Santa Clara, CA) that was frequency shifted via stimulated Raman scattering in a hydrogen cell was used. The detector was an intensified diode array run in the CW mode (P/N IRY-1024S/B, Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). The spectral bandwidth of the monochromator was approximately 2.5 cm-1, and the resolution of the detector array was approximately 0.9 cm-1 per pixel. Raman spectra were calibrated using solvent spectra with previously determined peak assignments. A least-squares fit was used to map the pixel number onto relative wavenumbers (Raman shift), and the resulting Raman shift values are estimated to be accurate to within (0.25 cm-1. The Raman spectra were baselined using a polynomial fitting routine in LabCalc (Galactic Industries, Salem, NH), were normalized in intensity using the 7 mode band at 672 cm-1, and are presented without smoothing. In this study, the sample was contained in either a spinning NMR tube or a special disk-shaped holder described previously (28). The focus in this study was on the low-frequency portion of the Raman spectrum which contains (Fe-His), the iron-proximal histidine stretching mode. This Raman band is especially sensitive to both quaternary and tertiary conformation changes (28-38). UV Resonance Raman Spectra. The CW UV resonance Raman spectra of the deoxy and CO-bound derivatives of HbA and RY42A were generated using the 229 nm output of a frequency-doubled argon ion laser (1.8 mW at the sample). The Raman scattered light was collected, dispersed, and detected using a previously described (14, 39-41) UV Raman apparatus derived from a single spectrograph with a CCD detector. As in previous UV Raman studies, the 934 cm-1 perchlorate band is used as an internal Raman intensity standard. Sample Preparation for Raman Measurements and Sample Integrity. Both the UV and visible resonance Raman measurements utilized solution samples that were 0.8 mM in heme at pH 7.5 (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer). When IHP was present, its concentration was 5-fold greater than that of the Hb tetramer. The samples also contained 0.3 M sodium perchlorate for use as an internal Raman intensity standard for the UV Raman measurements. The oxidation state, degree of ligation, and degree of degradation were determined by measuring the absorption spectra of samples before and after each data acquisition on

Kavanaugh et al. a Perkin-Elmer UV-vis spectrometer. A protocol was developed that allowed for the generation of the absorption spectrum from small volumes of the sample within NMR tubes. Crystal Growth. Prior to crystallization, the RY42A mutant hemoglobin was stripped of organic and inorganic ions by being passed over a Dintzis column (24) that was modified by the addition of a 1 mm layer of chelating resin (iminodiacetic acid, Sigma catalog no. C-7901) to the top of the column. The stripped oxyhemoglobin was frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until it was used for crystallization. Thawed oxyhemoglobin solutions and all of the crystallization stock solutions were thoroughly deoxygenated before use, and all crystallization work was conducted in a glovebag that was continuously purged with nitrogen. Crystals of deoxyhemoglobin are typically grown from concentrated solutions of ammonium sulfate as described by Perutz (42) or from PEG solutions as first described by Ward et al. (43). The monoclinic crystals that grow from ammonium sulfate solutions are often termed "high-salt" crystals, and the orthorhombic crystals that grow form PEG solutions are often termed "low-salt" crystals. Although the high-salt conditions failed to produce crystals of the deoxy RY42A mutant, crystals were obtained using the low-salt crystallization conditions. Specifically, crystals were grown in 100 µL batch setups at room temperature from solutions containing 10 mg/mL Hb, 10 mM ammonium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mM potassium chloride, 3 mM sodium dithionite, and 10-10.5% PEG 6000. Each vial was seeded with a small deoxy HbA crystal as previously described (2). Although the resulting crystals appeared to be well-formed and were isomorphous with low-salt deoxy HbA crystals (crystal form 1 in Table 1), they did not diffract as well as the typical crystals of wild-type or other mutant hemoglobins that grow from the low-salt conditions (see below). After the standard high- and low-salt crystallization protocols failed to yield high-quality crystals of deoxy RY42A, alternative crystallization conditions were explored. Crystal Screen 1 (44) and Crystal Screen 2 (45) kits (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA) were used to carry out 20 µL batch setups in which the hemoglobin concentration was 20 mg/mL and the concentration of the crystallization reagent was 80% of the published concentration. Each vial also contained 3 mM sodium dithionite for maintenance of the iron atoms in the ferrous state. For crystallization reagents that gave promising results, 100 µL batch setups in which the concentration of the crystallization reagent was varied were created. Well-ordered crystals that diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution were obtained using Crystal Screen 1 reagent 10. Crystals grew best when the concentration of reagent 10 was 50% of its stock concentration; i.e., crystals grew from solutions containing 15% PEG 4000, 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 100 mM ammonium acetate, 20 mg/mL RY42A, and 3 mM sodium dithionite. These crystals were not isomorphous with either the high- or low-salt crystal forms of deoxyhemoglobin, but they were isomorphous with wild-type deoxy HbA crystals grown from very low ionic strength solutions containing 12-14% PEG 1450 [N.-L. Chan and A. Arnone, unpublished results; Kavanaugh et al. (46); crystal form 2 in Table 1].

Collection of X-ray Diffraction Data. All X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku AFC6 diffractometer fitted with a San Diego Multiwire Systems area detector, and all data were scaled and merged according to the procedure of Howard et al. (47). The low-salt deoxy RY42A crystals were washed in a substitute mother liquor containing 13% PEG 6000 and mounted in quartz capillary tubes prior to data collection. Although (as mentioned above) most of these crystals did not diffract well, one crystal diffracted reasonably well to 2.0 Å resolution, but the Rsymm statistic was rather high at 15.3% (Table 1). Crystals of deoxy RY42A in crystal form 2 were washed briefly in a substitute mother liquor of 15% PEG 4000 containing fresh sodium dithionite and then mounted in quartz capillaries. The crystals diffracted well to 1.98 Å resolution with an Rsymm of 6.5% (Table 1). Refinement and Cross-Validation of the Structural Changes in RY42A in Crystal Forms 1 and 2. The crystal structures of deoxy RY42A in crystal forms 1 and 2 were refined and the mutation-induced structural changes validated using the protocols recently described by Chan et al. (48). In brief, each native deoxy HbA diffraction data set (i.e., data sets from crystal forms 1 and 2) was randomly divided into 10 mutually exclusive test data sets consisting of 10% of the data and working data sets consisting of the remaining 90% of the data. The corresponding deoxy RY42A diffraction data for crystal forms 1 and 2 were assigned to the same test and working data sets on the basis of their Miller indices. For each crystal form, 10 native deoxy HbA atomic models were debiased (49) relative to the 10 test data sets by carrying out more than 600 cycles of maximum-likelihood refinement using REFMAC5 (50, 51). Each deoxy HbA model (that had been debiased relative to a particular test data set) was then used as a starting model (with Tyr42R converted to an alanine residue)3 for the refinement of deoxy RY42A in crystal forms 1 and 2 (10 atomic models for each crystal form). These refinements consisted of rigid-body refinements with X-PLOR (52) as described previously (48), followed

by REFMAC5 refinement and minor manual corrections with the TOM/FRODO software (53, 54). Refinement statistics for deoxy HbA and deoxy RY42A in crystal forms 1 and 2 are listed in Table 1. The Rlocal-5 statistic (46, 48) then was used to validate free the mutation-induced tertiary structure changes in both crystal forms 1 and 2. This statistic uses the unbiased test data sets to cross-validate small tertiary structure differences between wild-type deoxy HbA and RY42A. That is, the localized mutation-induced changes in tertiary structure that were introduced during the second stage of the refinement (the REFMAC5 and TOM/FRODO refinement) were crossvalidated through the use of "hybrid" atomic models. Specifically, after convergence of the final REFMAC5 refinement cycles, hybrid atomic models were generated by replacing the coordinates of each pentapeptide in the final REFMAC5 refined model with the coordinates of the corresponding pentapeptide of the atomic model that had undergone only rigid-body refinement (but not individual atom refinement). The coordinates for each of these hybrid models were identical to those of the final refined model except for a single (unrefined) pentapeptide. The standard Rfree value (55) calculated with a particular hybrid model minus the standard Rfree value calculated with the final atomic model is defined as the Rlocal-5 value associated with the free replaced pentapeptide. If the structural changes associated with a particular pentapeptide represent a genuine improvement to the starting model, the corresponding Rlocal-5 value free should be significantly greater than zero. Because the Rlocal-5 value is a statistic that is sensitive only to structural free changes in a particular peptide, it can be used to discriminate between small genuine structural changes and those changes

3810 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 10, 2005 in the atomic model that are due to experimental uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty associated with poorly defined regions of the electron density map). When the individual Rlocal-5 values are plotted versus free residue number, a Rlocal-5 profile is generated that can be free compared with a corresponding rmsd5 profile of the rootmean-square tertiary structure differences (see below) between the two structures being analyzed. Peaks in the Rlocal-5 profile identify (cross-validate) significant differfree ences in tertiary structure. By averaging all 10 Rlocal-5 free profiles (one for each of the 10 test data sets) to generate a Rlocal-5 profile, we use all the diffraction data to crossfree validate the observed tertiary structure changes. Analysis of Crystal Structures. To identify mutationinduced changes in tertiary structure, corresponding subunits of deoxy HbA and RY42A were superimposed using an iterative least-squares superposition ("sieve-fit") procedure (4, 46) similar to that described by Gerstein and Chothia (56). Changes in tertiary structure were identified by calculating the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of all the atoms (backbone and side chain atoms) for each pair of corresponding pentapeptides in the superimposed subunits. This statistic, termed rmsd5, is plotted versus residue number to generate a profile of the five-residue averaged tertiary structure changes. A five-residue window was selected so that the rmsd5 values corresponded with the Rlocal-5 values free (above). Mutation-induced changes in quaternary structure were analyzed using methods originally described by Cox (57) and more recently by Mueser et al. (4) and Kavanaugh et al. (46). RESULTS CO Combination Kinetics. The time courses for the combination of CO with deoxy HbA and deoxy RY42A at pH 7 in the absence and presence of 100 µM IHP were compared. The results are shown in Figure 1. The kinetics of combination of CO with cross-linked RY42A are also presented. As previously demonstrated [see Figure 6 of Fowler et al. (58)], cross-linking HbA has little effect on the kinetics of CO combination with the unliganded protein either in the absence or in the presence of IHP. As expected, CO combines with deoxy HbA with accelerating kinetics both in the absence and in the presence of IHP, the effect of the latter being to slow the combination reaction by a factor of roughly 2. On the other hand, CO combines with deoxy RY42A in the absence of IHP in two easily distinguished kinetic phases, a small, rapid reaction followed by a much larger, relatively slow reaction. Cross-linking the RY42A variant eliminates the initial fast kinetic phase in CO combination and yields a markedly autocatalytic time course for the reaction. Addition of 100 µM IHP to un-cross-linked RY42A also eliminates the rapid kinetic phase, again resulting in an accelerating kinetic process. IHP addition also slows the overall reaction considerably. As previously reported (25), the biphasic reaction of CO with the deoxy RY42A variant in the absence of IHP can be fitted to a sum of two exponential functions. As presented in Table 2, the rapid process was found to represent roughly 10% of the total reaction with an average second-order rate constant of 7 µM-1 s-1. At the same time, approximately 90% of the reaction occurs with an average rate constant of

The slower rate constant is indicative of a quaternary-T tetramer with a greater than normal rate of ligand binding and therefore consistent with an increased ligand affinity. Nonetheless, this slower rate constant is well below those of either dimers or quaternaryRe hemoglobin tetramers. If the accelerating reactions are fitted to single-exponential functions, one obtains an estimate of the overall rate of the reaction, but the data are not well fitted. However, sums of exponential functions cannot give meaningful fits to such time courses. As previously reported (25), such data can be fitted to a two-step sequential process:

No claim is made that such a representation adequately describes the kinetics of binding of CO to hemoglobin. However, this procedure yields reasonably good fits to the data, and the ratio of l to l offers a convenient measure fin init of autocatalysis. Furthermore, l has been shown to be init closely correlated with oxygen affinity of the low-affinity T quaternary state in the presence of IHP (59-61). The secondorder rate constants obtained from fittings to singleexponential functions, l, and to two sequential processes, l and l , are reported in Table 2. init fin In the absence of IHP, the l /l ratio for HbA is fin init roughly 3. The addition of IHP reduces the rate of binding of CO to HbA, and in general lowers the l /l ratio. The fin init sequential fit to the accelerating reaction observed with RY42A in the presence of IHP indicates a l /l ratio of 3. fin init The apparent rate constants associated with l and l are fin init significantly greater than those for HbA under the same experimental conditions, and in the presence of IHP actually approximate those of HbA in the absence of IHP. The sequential fit to the accelerating kinetics of the reaction of CO with cross-linked RY42A in the absence of IHP gives an l /l ratio of 1.8, and the l and l values are again fin init fin init significantly greater than those for HbA under the same experimental conditions. The apparent difference in the values of l for tetrameric, un-cross-linked RY42A, and cross-linked RY42A probably results from the presence of rapidly reacting dimers in the former case. The effect of the initial rapid kinetic reaction is to mask the slower portion of the accelerating reaction of CO with the Hb tetramer. This has two effects. It results in an overly high estimate of the rate for the rapid phase, and skews the estimate of the rate of the slower, tetramer process toward that of the latter portion of the process, l . Therefin fore, the estimated rate of the tetramer reaction for the uncross-linked mutant, 0.52 µM-1 s-1, is probably most properly compared to l for the cross-linked sample, 0.57 fin µM-1 s-1. Oxygen Equilibrium Measurements. In Figure 2, fractional saturation with oxygen is plotted as a function of log PO2 for HbA and the RY42A variant at pH 7 and 20 °C in the presence and absence of 100 µM IHP. As listed in Table 3, in both the presence and absence of IHP, the oxygen partial pressure required for half-saturation of the RY42A mutant is some 3-fold lower than that for HbA. This increase in

oxygen affinity is accompanied by a decrease in overall cooperativity in the absence of IHP, but in the presence of IHP, the effect of the mutation on cooperativity appears to be negligible. Visible Resonance Raman Spectra. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the low-frequency portion of the Soretenhanced resonance Raman spectra of deoxy HbA and deoxy RY42A. The frequencies of all the observed Raman bands, including (Fe-His), are almost identical for the deoxy derivatives of HbA (bottom) and RY42A (top) in both the presence and absence of IHP (5-fold excess over tetramer). Figure 4 shows a blowup of the iron-proximal histidine stretching mode, (Fe-His). It is observed that for both species, the spectrum is minimally sensitive to the addition of IHP; however, as can be seen in Figure 4, there is a slight difference in the band profile of (Fe-His) when comparing the two samples. The band for deoxy RY42A is skewed slightly toward higher frequencies (dark and light solid lines) compared to that of deoxy HbA (dashed line). This difference is seen both with and without IHP. The primary cause of the difference appears to arise from the low-frequency shoulder that is known to be derived from the heme contribution of the R-chains. Deoxy derivatives of Hbs that are likely to yield detectable concentrations of dimer such as certain 37 mutants (28) yield frequencies that are significantly elevated compared to those reported above. UV Resonance Raman Spectra. The high-frequency region of the 229 nm excited UV resonance Raman spectrum from hemoglobin contains bands that have been well characterized with respect to conformational degrees of freedom related to allostery. The weak band at 1512 cm-1 has recently been reassigned as the 2xW18 overtone mode (62). This band shows a decrease in intensity when HbA switches from the deoxy state to the fully liganded state (32, 63-65). This

Kavanaugh et al. bands at 1618, 1207, and 1178 cm-1, respectively. A small feature is seen at the W3 low-frequency shoulder, whereas readily discernible features are seen for the W7 Fermi doublet and at W16. The difference at the Fermi doublet is consistent with an intensity increase in the 1360 cm-1 peak for RY42A and is indicative of a more hydrophobic environment within the RY42A mutant. The corresponding difference spectrum for the CO-bound derivatives, shown as trace e, is very similar to the deoxy difference spectrum. For both the deoxy and CO derivatives, the changes in the 1512 cm-1 band, the W3 band, and the Y8a band are more clearly seen in Figure 6, where a blowup of the high-frequency region of the spectrum is shown. Analysis of the X-ray Crystal Structures of Deoxy RY42A. In general, single mutations do not induce large changes in protein structure. Since mutation-induced changes in tertiary structure are typically on the order of a few tenths of an angstrom, assessing the validity of these small atomic movements is a challenging problem. One test of the significance of a small change in structure is its reproducibility in crystallographically independent environments in the same crystal lattice (i.e., by making use of noncrystallographic symmetry) or in difference crystal lattices. The Rlocal-5 parameter (described above) provides a second, free complementary approach to the verification of small changes in tertiary structure. As shown below, very small mutationinduced changes in atomic positions and temperature factors in RY42A are reproduced accurately in the crystallographically independent R1 1 and R2 2 dimers of both crystal forms 1 and 2. These structural perturbations are corroborated by the Rlocal-5 parameter which cross-validates structural free changes as small as 0.2 Å. Shown in Figure 7 are plots of rmsd5 and Rlocal-5 free profiles for the R-subunits in crystal form 2 (panels a and b) and crystal form 1 (panels c and d) where each parameter has been calculated over all overlapping five-residue windows. In both crystal forms, the rmsd5 and Rlocal-5 profiles free identify two major regions of mutation-induced changes in tertiary structure: feature 1R (pentapeptides centered at residues 39R-48R) and feature 2R (pentapeptides centered at residues 89R-98R). Feature 2R has the largest rmsd5 magnitude, occurs in both crystal forms and in both the crystallographically independent R1 and R2 subunits, and is independently validated by unambiguous peaks in the Rlocal-5 profiles. With regard to feature 1R in crystal form free 2 (panels a and b in Figure 7), it has a significant rmsd5 magnitude (albeit slightly smaller than the rmsd5 magnitude of feature 2R) and it occurs in both the crystallographically independent R1 and R2 subunits and is independently validated by an unambiguous peak in crystal form 2 Rlocal-5 profile. Although feature 1R in crystal form 1 does free not appear as an obvious rmsd5 peak in panel c of Figure 7, there is a clear Rlocal-5 peak for feature 1R in panel d of free Figure 7. Therefore, it is apparent that the Rlocal-5 profile free is capable of discriminating very small, valid structural changes (i.e., genuine mutation-induced perturbations) from small rmsd5 fluctuations that are due to random refinement variations. In addition to features 1R and 2R, the rmsd5 and Rlocal-5 profiles in Figure 7 indicate that a minor feature free (feature 3R which is located at the R COOH terminus) also may be significant.

FIGURE 4: Blowup of the (Fe-His) Raman bands for deoxy HbA (,,,) and deoxy RY42A with and without added IHP (s) showing a small frequency difference between the two proteins. The other low frequency Raman bands occurred at exactly the same position for the two deoxy derivatives as reflected in a precise overlap of all the Raman bands shown in Figure 3 with the exception of the (Fe-His) band.

intensity change is related to Trp37 in the R1 2 interface based on this band's behavior in the W37E mutant (66). The W3 band at 1558 cm-1 has two contributions (36, 63, 64, 67, 68). The central feature that peaks at 1558 cm-1 is derived from the two A-helix tryptophans (R14 and 15), whereas the ligation-sensitive shoulder at 1550 cm-1 originates from Trp37 . The intensity of this shoulder is reflective of the ligation-sensitive hinge region of the R1 2 interface. Shifts in the position of the 1558 cm-1 band are directly linked to changes in the tryptophan 2 dihedral angle. For HbA, the tyrosine-derived Y8a band at 1616 cm-1 shows an 2 cm-1 shift to higher frequency when liganded HbA is converted to deoxy HbA (32, 63, 65, 69, 70). This frequency shift originates primarily from Tyr42R in the R1 2 interface (14, 63, 64, 71-73). Figures 5 and 6 show comparisons of the 229 nm-excited resonance Raman spectra of deoxy and CO HbA and RY42A. At this excitation wavelength, most if not all of the major features in the spectra are derived from vibrational modes of tyrosine and tryptophan (74, 75). In Figure 5, difference spectra are shown as well as a representative spectrum for COHbA (trace a). Trace b shows the previously reported (63-65, 70) deoxy minus liganded (CO) difference spectrum for HbA. Note that in this difference spectrum, the intensity at approximately 1550 cm-1 corresponds to the lowfrequency shoulder of the W3 band whose main peak is at 1558 cm-1. The corresponding deoxy minus CO difference spectrum for the RY42A mutant shown as trace c is quite similar with respect to W3 at 1550 cm-1, the band at 1511 cm-1, W7 at 1361 cm-1, and W16 at 1011 cm-1. A very noticeable difference between the HbA and RY42A is seen in the region of Y8a at approximately 1616 cm-1. For HbA, a substantial derivative-shaped difference band is observed, whereas for RY42A, the derivative-shaped signal is essentially eliminated with only a small intensity difference remaining. Similarly, the large negative difference band for Y9a at 1178 cm-1 is reduced for RY42A. Trace d is the deoxy HbA minus deoxy RY42A difference spectrum. Positive intensity is seen for the Y8a, Y7a, and Y9a tyrosine

nitudes of the peaks for features 1 and 2 are nearbackground levels in the rmsd5 profiles, their significance would be questionable in the absence of cross-validation by the Rlocal-5 parameter. Moreover, as discussed below, the free fact that the -subunit residues associated with features 1 and 2 are in contact with Tyr42R is further evidence that these very small structural changes are not spurious. The rmsd5 and Rlocal-5 profiles in panels a and b of free Figure 8 indicate that in crystal form 2 (but not in crystal form 1) a third region of the -subunits (residues 116 122 ) undergoes a small change in structure. This region is on the surface of 1 and 2 subunits and not associated with the Tyr42R mutation site. Because resides His116 , His117 , and Glu121 are part of this region, the structural change appears to be pH-induced. That is, crystal form 2 crystals of deoxy RY42A and deoxy HbA were grown at pH 4.6 and 7.0, respectively. Thus, residues with side chain pK values between pH 4.6 and 7.0 may have changed their degree of ionization and moved to a new position of equilibrium. (The crystal form 1 crystals of deoxy RY42A and deoxy HbA were both grown at pH 7.0.) Located at the COOH-terminal end of the C-helix, the side chain Tyr42R interacts with a number of residues that are part of the quaternary-T R1 2 interface (Figure 9). In particular, the hydroxyl group of Tyr42R1 makes a tight intersubunit polar contact 2.7 Å in length with the carboxyl group of Asp99 2 and a few weaker intersubunit van der Waals contacts 3.5-4.0 Å in length with the guanidinium group of Arg40 2. In addition, a number of intrasubunit packing contacts of e4 Å occur between Tyr42R and Thr39R, Thr41R, Phe43R, Val93R, Asp94R, Asn97R, and the edge of the heme group. Included among these are a 3.0 Å hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of Asp94R and a 3.3 Å hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn97R. The side chain of Tyr42R1 also participates in an R1 2

Shown in Figure 8 are plots of rmsd5 and Rlocal-5 free profiles for the -subunits in crystal form 2 (panels a and b) and crystal form 1 (panels c and d). In both crystal forms, the rmsd5 and Rlocal-5 profiles identify the same two free regions of mutation-induced changes in tertiary structure: region 1 (pentapeptides centered at residues 38 -42 ), region 2 (pentapeptides centered at residues 96 -102 ). The independent Rlocal-5 profiles from crystal forms 1 and free 2 cross-validate very small tertiary structural changes as genuine mutation-induced perturbations. Because the mag-

intersubunit water bridge; the water molecule (labeled w1 in Figure 9) is positioned 2.9 Å from the hydroxyl group of Tyr42R1 and 3.0 Å from the amide side chain of Asn102 2. Elimination of the phenolic group of Tyr42R ruptures all of the contacts mentioned above and creates a large cavity at the center of the quaternary-T R1 2 interface in deoxy RY42A. As illustrated in Figure 9 (where the R-subunits of RY42A and deoxy HbA have been superimposed), most of the R1 subunit atoms that were in contact with the side chain of Tyr42R1 move toward the cavity in an attempt to fill the newly created void. These movements correspond to features 1R and 2R in Figure 7, the largest mutation-induced tertiary structure changes in deoxy RY42A. The small shifts seen in the 2 subunit in Figure 9 are a combination of the very small tertiary structure changes 1 and 2 identified in Figure 8 and a very small change in quaternary structure. (Rigidbody analysis revealed a 0.3° mutation-induced rotation of the R1 1 dimer relative to the R2 2 dimer.) In addition to the changes in atomic positions, the RY42A mutation results in significant increases in the average atomic temperature factors for the side chains of residues Val93R, Asp94R, Asn97R, Arg40 , and Asp99 as well as for the bridging

water molecule (w1 in Figure 9). The temperature factors of these side chains and water w1, which are in contact with Tyr42R, increase by a factor of 2. There is also a 0.1-0.2 Å increase in length for the Asp94R-Trp37 and Asn97RAsp99 hydrogen bonds located near the RY42A mutation site, suggesting these hydrogen bonds are weakened in deoxy RY42A. DISCUSSION The Tyr42R1-Asp99 2 interaction occurs at the center of the R1 2 interface in the quaternary-T structure of deoxyhemoglobin, where the hydrogen bond between Tyr42R1 and Asp99 2 has been hypothesized to be an important quaternary-T constraint (76, 77). This hypothesis was supported by studies on two site-directed mutant hemoglobins, RY42F and RY42H (15-18). In contrast to the cooperative RY42H mutant that had an only slightly elevated ligand affinity and formed a His42R1-Asp99 2 hydrogen bond, the RY42F mutant, which cannot form a hydrogen bond with Asp99R, was found to be noncooperative and to have very high ligand affinity. Spectroscopic evidence indicated that deoxy RY42F has a tertiary structure similar to that of fully

The rmsd5 parameter is the root-mean-square deviation in R-subunit atomic coordinates calculated after a deoxy RY42A R-subunit has been superimposed via the sieve-fit protocol (see local-5 Materials and Methods) onto the corresponding deoxy HbA R-subunit.

Water molecule w1 is shown as dark and light spheres for deoxy HbA and deoxy RY42A, respectively. Hydrogen bonds to water w1 are represented by dotted lines. An analogous stereo figure (not shown) for crystal form 1 structures of deoxy HbA and deoxy RY42A shows the same mutation-induced structural changes as those shown for crystal form 2.

liganded HbA, and this was interpreted as indicating that deoxy RY42F has a quaternary structure similar to that of fully liganded HbA and is incapable of adopting the quaternary-T structure of deoxy HbA (15, 16). Thus, Ishimori et al. (15) concluded that, "the hydrogen bond formed between Tyr42R and Asp99 is required to convert unliganded hemoglobin to the T-state", and Imai et al. (16) stated that, "the hydrogen bond between Tyr42R and Asp99 plays a key role in stabilizing the deoxy T structure and consequently in cooperative oxygen binding". However, removal of just the OH group of Tyr42R buries a very hydrophobic phenylalanine side chain next to the side chain of Asp99 , which has been shown to be negatively charged in quaternary-T hemoglobin (78). Thus, in addition to eliminating the Tyr42R1-Asp99 2 hydrogen bond, the RY42F mutation places the side chains of both Asp99 and Phe42R in very unfavorable environments, shifting the T-Re equilibrium in favor of the Re ensemble and/or forcing the dissociation of the hemoglobin tetramer to free R dimers. In contrast, the RY42A mutation creates a cavity that is large enough to allow Asp99 to be hydrated and leaves the -methyl group of Ala42R in the same environment as the -methylene group of Tyr42R (i.e., packed against the edge of the R-heme group). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that removing the Tyr42R1-Asp99 2 hydrogen bond in the RY42A mutant will have a much weaker destabilizing impact on the quaternary-T tetramer than removing the Tyr42R1Asp99 2 hydrogen bond in the RY42F mutant. This hypothesis is supported by the functional, spectroscopic, and crystallographic studies on RY42A reported above, which demonstrate that a quaternary-T structure, with only moderately increased ligand affinity, can be formed in the absence of the Tyr42R1-Asp99 2 hydrogen bond. Thus, the Tyr42R1-Asp99 2 hydrogen bond is not a major quaternary constraint, and its role in hemoglobin's stereochemical

mechanism of action is much less important than previously proposed. Two Crystal Structures of Deoxy RY42A Exhibit Only Small Mutation-Induced Perturbations. The two independent crystal structures of deoxy RY42A described above clearly show that the elimination of the phenolic side chain of Tyr42R does not greatly perturb the quaternary or tertiary structure of deoxyhemoglobin. The RY42A mutation, which creates a large cavity in the R1 2 interface, still results in an only 0.3° rotation of the R1 1 dimer relative to the R2 2 dimer and in small tertiary structure changes of a few tenths of an angstrom. It is interesting to compare the small structural changes in deoxy RY42A with those generated by mutations at residue Trp37 , another residue whose bulky side chain is buried in the R1 2 interface where it makes both polar and nonpolar intersubunit interactions. Like the RY42A mutation, the W37A and W37G mutations create large cavities that diminish the stereochemical complementarity of the R1 2 interface. However, in deoxy W37A and deoxy W37G, the R1 1 dimer rotates relative to the R2 2 dimer by 1.0° and 2.0°, respectively (46). While mutations at positions 42R and 37 result in small, but valid, tertiary structure changes that involve many of the same atoms located at the R1 2 interface, there are important differences in the nature of the tertiary structure changes in RY42A and those observed in the 37 variants. For both mutation sites, the largest change in tertiary structure involves movement of residues in the R-subunit FG corner-G helix region that correspond to cross-validated feature 2R in Figure 7. However, the mutation-induced shifts of the atoms in this region of the R-subunit are in opposite directions in RY42A and the 37 variants. Specifically, in RY42A, the atoms associated with feature 2R shift toward the cavity created at the R1 2 interface, reducing the size of the cavity. This is a typical

3816 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 10, 2005 response to cavity formation that has been observed in several crystallographic studies of mutations that create internal cavities in small, monomeric globular proteins (79-81). In contrast, mutations at position 37 induce shifts of atoms in the R-subunit FG corner-G helix region that are directed away from the mutation site, enlarging the size of the cavity (46). Another difference in the tertiary structure changes in the 37 mutants versus those in RY42A involves the C-terminal dipeptide of the R-subunit. In deoxy RY42A, there are only small shifts in this region (feature 3R in Figure 7), whereas this region exhibits large changes in position and mobility in the deoxy structures of the 37 mutants. As discussed below, the differences in the structural response to mutations at Tyr42R and Trp37 suggest that in deoxyhemoglobin interactions associated with Trp37 create tension at the R1 2 interface that extends to the heme groups, whereas the interactions associated with Tyr42R induce little if any tension. Mutation-Induced Changes in the Stability of the Unliganded Hemoglobin Tetramer in Solution. The kinetics of combination of CO with RY42A reveals a number of effects of this mutation on the functional properties of the hemoglobin molecule, some obvious and others requiring some analysis to discern. In the presence of IHP, this mutant exhibits normal kinetic cooperativity, i.e., autocatalysis, but reacts with CO at roughly twice the rate of HbA. Because of the strong correlation between the CO combination rate and the ligand affinity of quaternary-T hemoglobin in the presence of IHP (59-61), it is possible to estimate that the ligand affinity of the deoxygenated quaternary RY42A tetramer is increased by approximately 2.5-fold. This increase is not insignificant but seems to be a minor effect when compared to the greater than 50-fold increase in the affinity of the quaternary T state resulting from the W37A mutation. In the absence of IHP, one observes a rapid kinetic phase representing roughly 10% of the total reaction. However, this rapid kinetic process is unlikely to originate from the presence of quaternary-Re tetramers in equilibrium with quaternary-T tetramers because the rate of establishment of the Re-T equilibrium is in general much faster than the rates of CO binding under our experimental conditions (a situation that would result in a single kinetic phase). On the other hand, the equilibrium between tetrameric hemoglobin molecules and R dimers relaxes at a much slower rate, supporting the assignment of the rapid process to the combination of CO with R dimers. This assignment is further supported by the elimination of the rapid process by chemically cross-linking the hemoglobin tetramers, or by the addition of IHP that binds preferentially to the deoxygenated quaternary-T tetramer. The presence of R dimers in the absence of IHP indicates destabilization of the deoxygenated hemoglobin tetramer by the RY42A substitution. Using a total heme concentration of 4 µM before mixing, the equilibrium constant for the assembly of deoxygenated R dimers into tetramers can be calculated to be 36 × 106 M-1. This indicates a standard free energy of tetramer assembly (G°) of -10 kcal/mol. According to Ackers et al. (9), the assembly free energy of deoxygenated HbA at pH 7.4 and 21.5 °C is -14.3 kcal/mol. Atha and Riggs (82) measured the pH dependence of the dimer-tetramer equilibrium of human HbA and found that between pH 7.4 and 7.0 the standard free energy for the assembly of deoxygenated R

Kavanaugh et al. dimers in forming the deoxygenated HbA tetramer becomes more negative by 0.6 kcal/mol. If one ignores the effect of a 1.5 °C change in temperature, this suggests that the RY42A substitution destabilizes the deoxygenated hemoglobin tetramer by some 4.9 kcal/mol. However, at pH 7.4 in the absence of IHP, the oxygen-saturated HbA tetramer is destabilized relative to the unliganded tetramer by 6.3 kcal/ mol (9). Using the data of Atha and Riggs (82), one can estimate that at pH 7 this free energy difference is increased to 7.2 kcal/mol. Therefore, if the stability of the unliganded Re quaternary state is similar to that of the liganded Re quaternary state, this mutant would exist primarily as quaternary-T tetramers, even if the RY42A mutation had no effect on the stability of Re tetramers. On the other hand, the presence of R dimers in equilibrium with the deoxygenated T state of RY42A requires the presence of a small percentage of Re state tetramers, sufficient to satisfy the dimer-Re equilibrium. The free energy of assembly of unliganded R dimers into Re tetramers is not known, but it is reasonable to suspect the presence of 1 or 2% of such high-affinity tetramers. These Re tetramers would have no significant effect on any of the other measurements reported here. However, the rate of CO combination with the deoxygenated tetramer is the sum of the products of the rate constants and the concentrations of each component of the tetramer population. Because of the very rapid rate at which CO combines with Re state tetramers, they would contribute significantly to the rate at which CO combines with deoxygenated RY42A even if present at very low concentrations. Therefore, addition of IHP to deoxygenated RY42A would have the effect of assembling all of the R dimers into tetramers and shifting the tetramer equilibrium to essentially 100% quaternary T. This might account for the fact that IHP has a greater effect on the rate of binding of CO to RY42A than to HbA. Effect of the RY42A Mutation on the OVerall Oxygen Affinity of Hemoglobin. The limited number of oxygen equilibria results reported here are sufficient to confirm that the RY42A variant forms hemoglobin tetramers, which bind oxygen cooperatively. The overall oxygen affinity at pH 7 is increased by a factor of approximately 3, both in the absence and in the presence of IHP. This is a greater increase than can be explained by a 2.5-fold increase in the oxygen affinity of the T quaternary state alone, but is consistent with a significant effect of the mutation on the stability of the quaternary T state and a resulting shift in the T-Re equilibrium. Solution Phase Quaternary Structure of RY42A. The deoxy minus CO UV resonance Raman difference spectrum for RY42A displays features that have been associated with the deoxy-to-liganded quaternary structure difference. In particular, the behaviors of the peak at 1550 cm-1 (which corresponds to the Trp37 contribution to W3) and the 1511 cm-1 peak (also associated with Trp37 ) are indicative of a deoxy-to-liganded quaternary structure difference in the hinge region of the R1 2 interface that is similar to that which is observed for HbA. The strong derivative-shaped feature seen for HbA in the Y8a region (Figures 5 and 6) is not seen in the difference spectrum of the mutant. This difference feature has been directly linked to the formation of the hydrogen bond between Tyr42R and Asp99 in deoxy HbA (14, 71, 72). Thus, it is not surprising that it is missing in the

Structure-Function Studies of RY42A Hemoglobin difference spectrum of RY42A as it was from the corresponding difference spectrum of the D99N/RY42D double mutant (14). These results, in conjunction with the oxygen binding titrations that show that RY42A is cooperative, indicate that the deoxy-to-liganded quaternary changes associated with both ligand reactivity and conformation at the hinge region of the R1 2 interface can occur in the complete absence of the Tyr42R-Asp99 hydrogen bond. It can also be seen from the detailed comparisons between HbA and RY42A that despite the near-normal functioning of the hinge region, the local environment about Trp37 is altered as reflected in the slight mutation-induced changes in the shoulder of W3 in the UV resonance Raman spectrum. These spectra were taken at high-protein concentration conditions in the presence of IHP, two factors that minimize the contribution of dimers. Under all conditions used to generate the Raman spectra, IHP has no impact on the spectra from the deoxy derivatives. As will be discussed in a subsequent section, these changes, albeit small, are likely reflective of the specific conformational differences that give rise to the altered tetramer properties of this mutant. Solution Phase Conformations of RY42A: Tertiary Structure at the Heme. The frequency of (Fe-His) is highly sensitive to the details of subunit tertiary structure, which respond to ligation, quaternary structure, and allosteric effectors (28, 29, 31, 33-38, 83-86). In general, the frequency of (Fe-His) for the deoxy derivative increases upon going from the T to the Re structures. Within the quaternary-T structure or the quaternary-Re ensemble, the frequency increases upon going from the deoxy derivative to the transient five-coordinate species generated within a few nanoseconds of photodissociation of the liganded derivative. For the photoproducts, the frequency increases upon going from ligated T to ligated Re. For a given ligated species, the addition of allosteric effectors typically lowers the frequency of (Fe-His). Thus, for HbA, the deoxy quaternary-T species and the photoproduct quaternary-Re species represent the low (214 cm-1) and high (230 cm-1) end points for the frequency of (Fe-His). Whereas for the end point frequencies there is little if any uncertainty assigning quaternary structure, the conformational assignment remains ambiguous for solutions that yield intermediate frequencies. For example, a frequency in the range of 218225 cm-1 could arise from either Re or T. The frequency of (Fe-His) for deoxy RY42A is at most 1 cm-1 higher than the low end point value seen for deoxy HbA. This frequency for deoxy RY42A is consistent with a quaternary-T species. Stereochemical Linkage among Tyr42R1, Trp37 2, and the R1-Heme Group. Recent research has demonstrated that the major region of quaternary-T constraint is located in a cluster of R1 2 interface residues centered at Trp37 and termed the "Trp37 cluster". In particular, Noble et al. (26) conducted an extensive alanine mutagenic screen of the dimer-dimer interface and found that the low ligand affinity of deoxyhemoglobin is most sensitive to mutations at Trp37 and those residues in contact with Trp37 . The relationship between the atomic interactions associated with the Trp37 cluster and the functional and spectroscopic properties of deoxy HbA emerged from extensive collaborative studies on a series of 37 mutants (21, 28, 46, 87). In these studies, it was observed that in the deoxy state the W37Y, W37A,

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 10, 2005 3817 W37G, and W37E mutants manifest a range of T-like quaternary structures and a range of tertiary conformations at the Trp37 cluster. In particular, Tyr140R shows a progressive increase in the level of disorder for the Tyr, Ala, Gly, and Glu mutations (46). The distribution of tertiary conformations associated with the packing of the R-subunit C-terminus corresponds to a distribution of proximal heme environments as reflected in a 214-218 cm-1 spread in the frequency of (Fe-His) (28). Specifically, an increased level of disorder at the C-terminus correlates with decreased proximal strain as reflected in an increase in the frequency of (Fe-His). Very recent crystallographic studies on quaternary-T nitrosylhemoglobin also demonstrate a direct linkage between the quaternary constraints associated with Trp37 and the Fe-His bond (48). When crystals of wildtype deoxyhemoglobin are exposed to NO, the R (but not the ) Fe-His bond is broken. In contrast, when crystals of W37E deoxyhemoglobin are exposed to NO, both the R and Fe-His bonds remain intact, indicating that ligandinduced strain at the R Fe-His bond is greatly reduced when the quaternary constraints associated with Trp37 are eliminated by mutation. Other spectroscopic studies on FeZn hybrid forms of HbA (37), sol-gel encapsulation studies on HbA (88), and variant hemoglobins with altered R C-termini (86, 89) also show that ligand binding within the quaternary-T structure induces tertiary structure changes that increase the frequency of (Fe-His) from 214 cm-1 to values ranging from 217 to 224 cm-1. The crystal structures of RY42A as well as the UV resonance Raman spectra show that removing the Tyr42R1Asp99 2 hydrogen bond and the other interactions associated with the phenolic side chain of Tyr42R results in small structural changes to the environment of Trp37 . In particular, the length of the Trp37 2-Asp94R1 hydrogen bond increases by 0.15 Å and Tyr140R (the R C-terminal penultimate tyrosine which is in contact with Trp37 ) shifts slightly (Figure 9 and feature 3R in Figure 7). The evidence presented above indicates that these small structural changes are the stereochemical basis for the small increase in the frequency of (Fe-His) and the modest increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy RY42A. Stability Versus Affinity for the Quaternary-T Tetramer. If one or more of hemoglobin's major quaternary-T constraints are eliminated by mutation, a correspondingly substantial increase in the ligand affinity of the quaternary-T state of the mutant hemoglobin tetramer must also occur. This linkage is the case for mutations at residue Trp37 (21, 26, 28, 46, 87), which have been shown to increase the ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer. Alternatively, an interaction across the R1 2 interface may serve to stabilize the T state tetramer with respect to dissociation into R dimers without having a direct effect on the ligand affinity of the quaternary-T state. If such an interaction is found only in the quaternary-T state, being absent from the ensemble of R state structures, then the elimination of the interaction by mutation will shift the T-Re equilibrium in favor of the Re states. This shift will increase the oVerall ligand affinity of the mutant hemoglobin without necessarily having an effect on the ligand binding properties of the T state. The interactions associated with Tyr42R are primarily of this type.
