Abstract Heme binding to rabbit hemopexin and its domain I, obtained by proteolytic cleavage of intact hemopexin, was studied by EPR, MCD and I H-NMR spectroscopies. The data obtained support the proposal that the heme Fe(III) is coordinated by two histidine ligands (Morgan et al. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8220-8225; Muster et al. (1991) J. Protein Chem. 10, 123-128) and are inconsistent with recently reported mutagen,:sis studies indicating that bis-histidine ligation is unlikely (Satoh et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 8423-8427). Although the MCD data are consistent with both bis-histidine and histidine/lysine ligation, the EPR spectra are typical of bis-histidine ligation. Overall the magneto-optical spectra are characteristic for bis-histidine ligation. The EPR and NMR data indicate that there is a difference in the heme environments of the intact hemopexin and its domain I but overall the spectroscopic information suggests heme bound to domain I has the same ligands as intact hemopexin. The t H-NMR studies indicate that heine binding to domain I perturbs at least 4 of the 5 histidine,s. This is consistent with axial ligation of the heme by two histidines, and a conformational change induced by heme binding affecting two more. Interestingly, resonances of the carbohydrate bound to intact hemopexin and domain I were also perturbed by heme binding, pH dependence studies showed that heme remained bound to intact hemopexin over the pH range 6.5-10.0 without any major change in the ligation or environment of the heme.

1. Introduction Hemopexin is a plasma glycoprotein which functions in heme and iron metabo]Lism in animals. It binds heme in plasma with the highest heme binding affinity reported for any protein [1-4] and then transports the heine to target tissues, principally to liver parenchymal cells [5-7]. The heme is taken into liver parenchymal cells via specific cell-surface receptors 118] and the apo-hemopexin, like apo-transferrin, is recycled to the plasma [8,9]. Hemopexin consists of ca. 440 amino acids organised into two structural domains [2,4,10-14] with = 2 5 % amino-acid sequence identity between them, indicative of gene duplication [15]. The N-terminal domain, or domain I, consists of

residues 1-213 in the rabbit protein, has N-linked oligosaccharides at positions 9, 41, and 164 [4,10,11] and contains the heme binding site [4,10,12]. The C-terminal domain acts to enhance the interaction of hemopexin with its specific membrane receptor and, perhaps, in heme release. The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain has been determined at 1.8 A resolution and the structure of the heme-binding N-terminal domain modelled on it [16]. Both domains have a flower-shaped configuration, with four 'petals' each representing a single = 45 residue module. The four modules of a domain pack together so that a disc-shaped structure is created with a tunnel running through the centre of the disc. The central tunnel in the N-terminal domain may be the heme binding site [16]. Heme has been proposed to bind to two histidines in domain I of hemopexin [4,14,17]. The magneto-optical spectroscopic evidence for this was based on low-temperature EPR and room-temperature visible MCD measure-

ments [18,19]. However, such studies are not definitive. As various authors have pointed out [20,21], only the axial ligand ~ Fe(III) charge-transfer absorption bands in the near-IR region, in combination with EPR data, can serve as spectroscopic indicators to identify the axial ligands. The chemical evidence for bis-histidine ligation involved the effect of bound heme on ethoxyformylation and acetylation of histidine residues of both hemopexin and domain I: the bound heme protects two histidine residues in the rabbit congener, His-56 and His-127, from modification [4]. However, heme binding causes conformational changes in the protein [2,4], and the possibility remains that the protection is an indirect effect of the conformational change accompanying heme binding and not a direct effect of histidine ligation to the heme iron. Further support for the identification of His-56 and His-127 as the axial ligands has been derived [4] from amino-acid sequence comparisons and limited proteolysis studies. Comparison of the sequences of rabbit [4], human [15,22] and rat [23] hemopexins show that there are only 4 invariant histidines in the heme binding domain, His-7, His-56, His-127 and His-213, and of these His-7 and His-213 can be removed by proteolysis without impairing heme binding ability [4,14]). In all these studies, however, there is no incontrovertible spectroscopic evidence that the heme is ligated by two histidines and therefore we set out to investigate this by a combined NIR-MCD, EPR and 1H-NMR study of intact rabbit hemopexin and its domain I: and that work is described in the present paper. Subsequent to the completion of our study Satoh et al. [24] reported that the His56-Thr variant of recombinant human hemopexin had a ~H-NMR spectrum nearly identical to that of the wild-type recombinant protein. Furthermore, both the heme binding affinity and the heme optical spectrum of the His56-Thr variant were stated to be the same as those of the wild-type recombinant protein. Though it is difficult to draw too many conclusions from the data presented by Satoh et al. [24], because their recombinant wild-type protein differed from native wild-type protein, nevertheless the similarity in properties between recombinant wild-type and His56-Thr variant is striking. Morgan and Wu [25] have also found that mutation of His-56 does not weaken heme binding and, moreover, in the model of the heme-free N-terminal domain of hemopexin proposed by Faber et al. [16] His-56 and His-127 are = 17 A apart. Thus, assuming His-127 is a ligand the role of His-56 needs to be reevaluated. Despite the similarities they observed between the recombinant wild-type and His56-Thr variant of hemopexin, Satoh et al [24] suggested that His-56 was indeed a heme ligand and that in the variant either Thr 56 or H 2 0 was the sixth axial ligand. It was argued that the low-spin character of the His56-Thr variant could be accounted for by a similar electronic model used to account for the low-spin ground state of cytochrome P-450cam [26,27], which has cysteinate and H 2 0 axial ligands [28]. However, cysteinate

has very different properties to histidine as an axial ligand [20]; cytochrome P-450ca m is not completely low-spin at room temperature [26]; there is no precedent for a hemoprotein with a histidine/alcohol or histidine/H20 axial ligation scheme to be completely low-spin; and there is no precedent showing that threonine can be an effective heme ligand. Furthermore, even if we assume that His56-Thr is completely low-spin with a threonine or H 2 0 axial ligand, the pattern of hyperfine shifted resonances should be different to those of the bis-histidine coordinated native hemopexin, since the magnetic anisotropy of the heme iron (which influences the hyperfine shifts) is determined in large measure by the axial ligands [29-32]. Thus, the explanation put forward by Satoh et al. [24] seems to us implausible and their data strongly indicates that His-56 is n o t a ligand to the heme. Satoh et al. [24] also studied the His~27-Thr and His56-Thr/His127-Thr variants of recombinant human hemopexin. Both bound heme with reduced affinities and altered heme optical spectra compared to the recombinant wild-type protein, consistent with the identification of His-127 as an axial ligand, and the latter variant had a ~H-NMR spectrum considerably different from that of the recombinant wild-type hemopexin. However, there appeared to be some similarity between the NMR spectra of the His~27-Thr variant and wild-type protein, though the extremely poor signal: noise ratio of the former spectrum [24] precludes a proper analysis. Therefore, given the amino-acid sequence comparison referred to above, the mutagenesis work undermines the bis-histidine axial ligation model, though the possibility remains that there are species differences with non-conserved histidines acting as ligands, for example, His-40 in rat hemopexin and His-82 in human hemopexin. This possibility is strengthened by the modelling studies based on the X-ray structure of the receptor binding domain which indicate that both His-40 and His-82 are close enough to the proposed heme binding site to be ligands [16]. The mutagenesis studies described above add further weight to the need for additional information concerning the axial ligation of the heme of hemopexin and that is provided by the present paper. Our results are consistent with the suggestion that the heme is bound to two histidines but they are also consistent with an axial ligation scheme of histidine/lysine, albeit one with an unusual EPR spectrum. Moreover, our data show that the environments of four histidines, and those of some of the oligosaccharide chains, are perturbed by heme binding, and that the heme environments of intact hemopexin and domain I are not identical.

apo-hemopexin and apo-hemopexin domain I with mesoheme, obtained from Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT), were prepared by stirring for one hour the apo-proteins, in 0.15 M NaC1 and 10 -3 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2 (phosphate-buffered saline; PBS), with aliquots of a 1 m g / m l solution of mesoheme in DMSO to give a 1: 1 ratio of heme to protein. Unbound heme and DMSO were removed by overnight dialysis against PBS at 277 K. The 1:1 ratio was determined by mixing equimolar amounts of apo-hemopexin or domain I with the corresponding amount of mesoheme, as determined using UV-visible spectroscopy. UV-visible spectra of the sample after dialysis showed that there was no unbound mesoheme, and since dialysis under the cond!itions used does not remove bound mesoheme [4], the resulting samples were judged to be fully loaded. 2H20 was used in place of H 2 0 for some experiments. In these cases quoted pH values are direct meter readings uncorrected for any isotope effects and are indicated by pH*. Numerous studies have shown that though the isotope effect on the glass electrode (at standard conditions) is: p2H = p H + 0.4

3. Results and discussion

3.1. MCD spectroscopy
The MCD spectrum of intact heme-hemopexin in 50:50 ( v / v ) PBS-glycerol is shown in Fig. 1. The near-UV-visible region of the spectrum (panel a) is typical for that of a low-spin heme [21] with the Soret band appearing as an intense feature with both positive and negative components, and the a / f l region showing a number of transitions. The absence of a band in the 700 nm region indicates that methionine is not a ligand to the heme iron [20,21]. The near-IR region (panel b) has a band with a Area at x 1550 nm which is indicative of a bis-histidine, histidinatemethionine or histidine-amine coordination set. However, methionine is eliminated as a ligand by the absence of a charge-transfer band at = 700 nm, and the NMR data given below eliminate histidinate as a ligand. Deciding

the isotope effect on fimctional group p K a values often cancels this out [33,34] For example, the carboxylic acid p K a values of acetic acid and glycine are greater in 2H20 than in H 2 0 by 0.51 and 0.38, respectively [34]. An example from our work is the determination of p K a values of heme propionic acid substituents of cytochromes in 2H20 solution by NMR and H 2 0 solution by optical spectroscopy [35]. The p K a values agreed to within _ 0.1 units when the direct meter readings were employed, consistent with reported i,;otope effects on carboxylic acid p K a values [34]. Electronic spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. MCD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-500 D dichrograph for the wavelength range 300-1100 nm, and on a home-built circular dichrograph in the range 800-3000 nm [21]. The magnetic field was provided by a SM-4 superconducting ,;olenoid (Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK) capable of generating a maximum magnetic field of 5 tesla. To ensure that good optical quality glasses were formed on freezing samples, glycerol was added to samples at a level of 50% (v/v). EPR spectra were recorded on a ER200 X-band spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a ESR-9 liquid helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). NMR spectra were measured on Jeol GX-400 spectrometer. All spectra were recorded with 0.5 ml sample volumes over spectral widths of 6000 Hz or 25 000 Hz. External dioxan was used as a chemical shift standard but chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield from the methyl resonance of 2,2-dimethyl.-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. COSY spectra were measured by standard procedures [36].

between bis-histidine and histidine-amine coordination is not straight-forward. There are many examples of the former, both with proteins and in model compounds, but few examples of the latter. Two of the best characterised hemoproteins with histidine-amine ligation are the alkaline isomer of mitochondrial ferricytochrome c [20,37,38] and plant cytochrome f [39]. The former has a lysine ligand and in the latter the N-terminal amine is a ligand. In both cases MCD spectroscopy does not distinguish between the bis-histidine and histidine-lysine models, but the combination of EPR and MCD spectroscopies appears to do so [37,40]. MCD spectra in the Soret and visible regions of oxidized and reduced heme-hemopexin reconstituted with protoheme and deuteroheme have been reported previously, and their similarity with the corresponding spectra of native cytochrome b 5 noted [18]. The visible region MCD spectrum of oxidized heme-hemopexin reconstituted with mesoheme differs from the reported spectra, probably because of the difference in the groups at the 2 and 4 positions of the tetrapyrrole ring. However, the similarity between the cytochrome b 5 visible-region MCD spectra and those of protoheme-hemopexin cannot be taken as evidence of identical axial ligand sets as claimed [18] because the 7r ~ 7r * transitions giving rise to these spectra are not sensitive to axial ligation. Only the ligand Fe(III) charge-transfer bands in the near IR region, examined for the first time here, are sensitive to the nature of the axial ligands [20,21].

and borate at pH 9. Our results with intact heme-hemopexin are in general agreement with their reported g-values for the hemopexin-bound heme of 2.86, 2.26 and 1.60. Bis-histidine ligated ferrihemes generally have gz values of 2.8-3.0 [20,21,31,42], though in cases where the magnetic anisotropy is highly axial and non-rhombic, the so-called 'Highly-Anisotropic Low-spin hemeproteinS (HALS)' [31,42], the gz value can be considerably shifted. The histidine/amine ligated hemes of the alkaline isomer of mitochondrial ferricytochrome c [37,38] plant cytochrome f [40] and the Met]°°-Lys variant of Thiobacillus versutus ferricytochrome c550 [43] have HALS type spectra with gz values in the range 3.30-3.55. Thus the normal EPR spectrum of heme-hemopexin, with its gz value of 2.89-3.01, together with the NIR-MCD data clearly mirrors many systems with bis-histidine ligated heroes; indeed heme-hemopexin seems to have the classic spectroscopic signatures of a bis-histidine ligated heme. However, in the light of the mutagenesis work described in the Introduction of the present paper, bis-histidine ligation involving His-56 seems impossible and we need to consider further the possibility that the heme is ligated by a histidine and an amine.

The X-band EPR spectra of intact heme-hemopexin and its heme-binding domain in a mixture of PBS and glycerol (50:50, v / v ) are given in Fig. 2. Signals at g = 2.89, 2.27 and 1.55 (panel a) and g = 2.95, 2.25 and 1.55 (panel b) arise from low-spin heme. The signals at g = 5.87 and g = 4.28 arise from high-spin heme and adventitious iron, respectively. (It should be noted that signals from high-spin iron are much more intense than those from low-spin iron). The EPR spectra are very similar in the absence of glycerol (not shown), although there is a shift in the g-values of the low-spin heme to g = 2.98, 2.25 and 1.48 for intact heme-hemopexin and to g = 3.01, 2.24 and 1.45 for the heme-binding domain. Although these shifts may reflect a small glycerol-induced conformational change, they are small and the g-value sets are consistent with an unchanged coordination of the iron [21]. However, the difference in g-values between intact heme-hemopexin and the heme-binding domain indicates that the heme environment is not identical in the two complexes. This is consistent with the results of NMR spectroscopy (see later) and differential scanning calorimetry measurements [41]. The previous EPR studies of heme-hemopexin carried out by Bearden et al. [19] were confined to the intact protein in aqueous buffers: phosphate at pH 6.3 and 7.4

--- 25 ppm and = 16 ppm have sufficient intensity relative to the peak at = 2 0 ppm to arise from heme methyl groups. Between pH 6.0 and pH 7.4, some of the hyperfine-shifted resonances are perturbed, but these perturbations are not reflected in the EPR or visible electronic spectra. By comparison with NMR studies of other heme proteins, for example bacterial cytochromes c [35], they probably arise from the ionization of groups close to the heme, perhaps even a heme propionate substituent. The axial histidine ligands do not ionize to histidinate since, by comparison with E. coli cytochrome b562 [45], this would have produced large shifts for most of the hyperfine shifted resonances. The loss of resonances on reducing the pH from 6.0 to 4.1 is reversible with no apparent hysteresis. At pH 4.1 there are no resonances with a chemical shift > 14 ppm. However, optical spectra over the range 250-700 nm (not shown) indicate that though the heme is in a high-spin state it is not free mesoheme. Similar behaviour has been observed for other heme proteins and is consistent with the heme remaining associated with the protein but undergoing a chemical exchange process coincident with the introduction of high-spin Fe(III), which broadens the resonances. Such behaviour is possibly the

The chemical evidence indicates that an amine ligand could not be the N-terminus [4], and this is supported by the NMR studies decribed below. However, the amino-acid sequence compilation of Morgan et al. [4], which indicates that there are 6 invari~tnt lysine residues in the human, rabbit and rat heme binding domains [4,15,22,23], shows there are candidate lysine ligands. The major difficulty with this model, however, is that the EPR spectrum of heme-hemopexin is not a HALS type spectrum and its gz value is considerably different from those of characterised histidine/amine hemoFoteins. Thus, if heme-hemopexin contains a histidine/lysine ligated heme it would be unique in its spectroscopic properties. Since the gz value and HALS effect are related to the orientations of the axial ligands with respect to the heme plane, this would presumably indicate that heme-lhemopexin differs in this regard to the histidine/amine heroes described above. 3.3. /H-NMR spectroscopy of paramagnetically shifted resonances 1H-NMR spectra of oxidized intact heme-hemopexin at various pH values and of oxidized heme-binding domain at pH 7, over the chemical shift range 14 ppm to 36 ppm are shown in Fig. 3. Resonances in this spectral region experience hyperfine shifts from the unpaired electron of Fe(III) and can be assigned to the heme group itself or to the heme-iron axial ligands [20,29,44]. The spectra of intact heme-hemopexin over the pH range 6.0-10.1 are typical of a low-spin Fe(III) heme protein [20,29,44]. Although peak assignments cannot be made with certainty by inspection only, the peaks in the pH 6 spectrum at = 33 ppm,

result of one or more of the histidine ligands being protonated [46]. Comparison of the spectra in Fig. 3 with those reported by Deeb et al. [17] and Satoh et al. [24] is not particularly informative, partly because we used mesoheme in our studies whilst Deeb et al. and Satoh et al. used protoheme. Also, the latter studied recombinant human hemopexin - and variants of it - - and it is not clear from their report how much of the spectroscopic difference they observed between recombinant and native hemopexins was caused by the differences in glycosylation. Perhaps more important, Deeb et al. [17] reported that the pattern of the hyperfine-shifted resonances between 15 and 35 ppm is species dependent, and the only spectrum they reported for rabbit hemopexin was recorded at 40°C. Nevertheless, the firm assignments of heme resonances of rabbit hemopexin (40°C and pH 7) at 30.1, 22.7 and 19.3 ppm given by Deeb et al. [17] accord reasonably well with the positions of the most intense hyperfine shifted peaks in our spectra (Fig. 3). The spectrum of the heme-binding domain is strikingly different to the spectrum of the intact protein over the range 14 ppm to 36 ppm (Fig. 3). Not only are there fewer hyperfine-shifted resonances for the heme binding domain, but the peaks observed are also of relatively low intensity

compared to the hyperfine-shifted resonances of intact hemopexin. This is despite the similarity in spectral quality for these proteins over the range - 2 ppm to 10 ppm (Fig. 4). This suggests that some of the intensity expected from the heme is too broad to be observed. The most probable explanation for this is that the heme environment of the heme-binding domain is subject to one or more exchange processes that are absent from the intact protein and lead to the heme resonances being broadened.

3.4. IH-NMR spectroscopy of the diamagnetic envelope region
The IH-NMR spectra over the range - 2 ppm to 10 ppm of intact apo-hemopexin, heme-hemopexin, apoheme-binding domain and complexed heme-binding domain are shown in Fig. 4. The spectra are typical of proteins containing a high degree of tertiary structure [36]. For example, peaks at chemical shifts characteristic of random-coil forms are not unusually intense; there is a relatively wide chemical shift dispersion in the aromatic region; and there are peaks with chemical shifts < 0.5 ppm. The sharp peaks at 3.5-4.0 ppm and at = 2 ppm come largely from the oligosaccharides of hemopexin. The relatively narrow linewidth of many of these peaks is a consequence of the greater mobility of the carbohydrate compared to that of the polypeptide component, consistent with the expected surface location for the hydrophilic carbohydrate moieties. Interestingly, binding of heme to either intact apo-hemopexin or to the apo-heme-binding domain perturbs the set of peaks at 2.4-4.0 ppm indicating that the environment of at least some of the carbohydrate is changed upon complex formation. The nature of the spectral perturbations is difficult to define accurately, but there are apparent increases in resonance line widths as well as changes in chemical shifts. This may be the result of a decrease in the mobility of some of the carbohydrate when heme binds. A region of the 2D-COSY spectrum of the heme complex of domain I is shown in Fig. 5. Some intense peaks are observed, but most cross-peaks are weak, as expected for a protein with rather broad NMR signals. The chemical shifts of the diagonal resonances giving rise to the intense cross-peaks are consistent with these resonances belonging to threonine, serine, proline and valine or leucine residues (Table 1). Since the chemical shifts are similar to the random coil chemical shifts, and since the COSY crosspeak intensities are relatively high, and the diagonal peaks are correspondingly sharp, it seems probable that these residues are in a region of the protein that is rather flexible. Furthermore, an identical set of 2D-COSY resonances with the same chemical shifts was observed for the heme-binding domain in the absence of heme (not shown), indicating that the residues giving rise to those peaks are not directly associated with heme binding.

The cross-peaks arising from an alanine, a valine, a leucine, a serine, a proline and two threonines are indicated. The spectrum was measured with 1024 tj increments over 512 t 2 data points and processed with a sine-bell window function in both dimensions.

that residues 1-22 can be cleaved from domain I without changing its heme binding ability. Fig. 6 shows the aromatic regions of the NMR spectra of apo-domain I (panel a) and ferriheme-bound domain I (panel b) over a range of pH values. Both sets of spectra were pH-dependent as a result of the ionization of histidine imidazole side chains. In apo-domain I the C-2 resonances of the entire complement of 5 histidine residues were observed to titrate with p K a values of 6.00, 6.25, 6.65, 6,75 and 7.5 (Fig. 7). In all cases the titration curves could be fitted to independent single-proton ionisations, indicat8'6"

ing that there is not a cooperative interaction between the histidines, or with any other group which might titrate within this pH range, in the absence of heme [47]. However, in heme-domain I only one histidine C-2 resonance was observed and that titrated with a p K a of 6.75. Thus, heme-binding perturbs two (or three) non-ligand histidines as well as the two (or one) axial ligand histidines. It seems probable that the histidine of apo-domain I with a p K a of 6.75 is the same as the histidine of heme-domain I with a p K a of 6.75, not only because of the identity in p K a values, but also because the two C-2 resonances have similar chemical shifts and narrow linewidths. These linewidths indicate that the histidine is relatively mobile compared to the other histidines and, having shown with the COSY experiments described earlier (Fig. 5) that the N-terminal portion of the protein is unaffected by heme binding and is relatively mobile, it seems probable that it is His-7 that has a p K a of 6.75. It is surprising that resonances of non-ligand histidines were not observed and this may be because they are close to the heme, which leads to their resonances being shifted a n d / o r broadened by the h e m e ' s anisotropic magnetic properties. This would be consistent with the heme binding model proposed by Faber et al. [16] which shows His-127 bound to the heme Fe, His-40 and His-82 close enough to the heme for either to be the sixth Fe ligand, and His-56 interacting with a heme propionate.

4. Conclusions
Our central finding is that the spectroscopic properties of heme bound to hemopexin are characteristic o f bishistidine ligation and are not diagnostic of any other ligation scheme. However, the M C D data could be acccounted for by h i s t i d i n e / l y s i n e ligation though the EPR data would be unusual for such a ligation scheme. Thus application of ' O c c a m ' s razor' leads us to concentrate on the bis-histidine ligation model. The problem with this, however, is that a combination of amino-acid sequence comparisons of hemopexins from different species and site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that there is, at most, only one invariant histidine capable of acting as a ligand, His-127. Thus, for the bis-histidine model to be acceptable the heme groups of different hemopexins must be ligated by different residues. Our results also show that the environments of four histidines, and those of some of the oligosaccharide chains, are perturbed by heme binding, and that the heme environments o f intact hemopexin and domain I are not identical.
