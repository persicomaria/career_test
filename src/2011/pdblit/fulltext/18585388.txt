The distributions of DNA cleavage sites induced by topoisomerase II in the presence or absence of specific drugs were mapped in the simian virus 40 genome. The drugs studied were 5-iminodaunorubicin, amsacrine (m-AMSA), teniposide (VM-26) and 2-methyl-ghydroxyellipticinium; each produced a distinctive pattern of enhanced cleavage. Consistently intense cleavage, both in the presence and in the absence of drugs, occurred in the nuclear matrix-associated region. Since topoisomerase II is a major constituent of the nuclear matrix, and cleavage complexes include a covalent link between topoisomerase II and DNA, the findings suggest that topoisomerase II may function to attach DNA t'o the nuclear matrix. Cleavage usually occurred on both DNA strands with the expected four base-pair 5' stagger, and strong sites tended to occur within A/T runs such as have been associated with binding to the nuclear scaffold. Intense cleavage was present also in the replication termination region, but was absent from the vicinity of the replication origin. Cleavage intensities were found to change with time in a manner that depended both on the site and on the drug, suggesting that topoisomerase II can move along the DNA from a kinetically preferred site to a thermodynamically preferred site.

1. Introduction DNA topoisomerase II is a nuclear enzyme that introduces a cut in a DNA duplex, catalyzes the passage of an intact DNA duplex through the gap and then reseals the break. The 5' termini of DNA double-strand breaks are covalently linked to a tyrosine residue of the enzyme and are staggered by four base-pairs (Liu, 1989; Wang, 1985, 1987). Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks can be detected after protein denaturation with sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and/or alkali, and can be enhanced by a variety of anticancer drugs (Liu, 1989; Pommier & Kohn, 1989). Consequently, topoisomerase IT inhibitors such as amsacrine

(m-AMSAt) and teniposide (VM-26) have been used to map enzyme binding sites in a variety of DNA fragments and cellular genes (Darby et al., 1986; Riou et al., 1986; Rowe et al., 1986; Udvardy et al., 1986; Yang et aE., 1985; Zwelling et al., 1988). Topoisomerase II is preferentially associated with the nuclear matrix of interphase cells and with the nuclear scaffold of metaphase chromosomes (Berrios et al., 1985; Earnshaw et aZ., 1985; Gasser & Laemmli, 1986). The latter is consistent with the essential role of the enzyme in chromosome condensation (Newport & Spann, 1987; Roberge et aZ., 1990; Wright & Schatten, 1990) and separation of daughter DNA molecules at the end of DNA replication (intermolecular DNA strand passage: DiNardo et al., 1984; Holm et al., 1985; Uemura et al., 1987).

Topoisomerase II, along with topoisomerase I, is also a DNA relaxing enzyme (intramolecular DNA strand passage), which may remove DNA supercoiling and torsional tension as they arise during transcription and DNA replication (Brill & Sternglanz, 1988; Brill et al., 1987; Kim & Wang, 1989; Wu et al., 1988). Simian virus 40 (SV40) uses host DNA topoisomerases for replication (Avemann et al., 1988: Hsiang et al., 1989; Shin & Snapka, 1990; Snapka, 1986; Wold et al., 1989; Yang et al., 1987) and contains a nuclear matrix-associated region (MAR) located in the early transcribed region of the virus (between positions 4100 and 4300: Prives et al., 1986). We have shown that the SV40 MAR is preferentially cleaved by mouse topoisomerase II in the absence of drug or in the presence of doxorubicin derivatives (Capranico et al., 199Ob;Pommier et al., 1990). In the present study, we have carried out a more detailed mapping of the cleavage sites produced by purified mouse leukemia (Ll210) DNA topoisomerase II and extended the study to compare several different classesof drugs.

2. Materials

and Methods

(a) Enzymes and chem2:calx m-AMSA and 5iminodaunorubicin were obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. VM-26 was obtained from Bristol-Myers Co., Wallingford, CT, and 2-methyl-ghydroxyellipticinium was a gift from Dr J. B. LePecq, RhBne-Poulenc Santi, Ivry/Seine. France. m-AMSA and VM-26 stock solutions were made in dimethylsulfoxide at 10 mM. Further dilutions were made in distilled water. 5-Iminodaunorubicin and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium stock solutions were at 10 mM in water. DNA, restriction endonucleases, phage T4 polynucleotide kinase, calf intestine phosphatase, agarose and polyacrylamide/his were purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD) or from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [y-32P]ATP was purchased from New England Nuclear Research Products (Boston, MA). DNA topoisomerase II was purified from mouse leukemia L1210 cell nuclei as described (Minford et al., 1986), and stored at -70°C in 40% (v/v) glycerol, @35 M-NaCl, 5 m&r-MgCl,, 1 mM-EGTA. 1 mivr-KH,Po,, @2 mMdithiothreitol, @l mM-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, (pH 64). The purified enzyme yielded a single 170,000 M, band after silver staining of SDS/polyacrylamide gels (Minford et al., 1986; Pommier et aE., 1986). (b) Preparation of end-labeled DNA fragments

cipitation with ethanol between each step and at t,he end of the labeling procedure. (c) Topoisomeraue II-induced DNA cleavage reactions

DNA fragments were 5'.end-labeled as described (Capranico et al., 1990; Fesen & Pommier, 1989). Briefly, native SV40 DNA was first linearized with one of the restriction enzymes shown in Fig. 1, then the DNA 5' termini were dephosphorylated with calf alkaline phosphatase and labeled with [y-"P]ATP (asterisks, Fig. 1) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Next, labeled DNA was subjected to a second enzyme digestion in order to generate uniquely 5'-end-labeled fragments of different length. which were separated and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and electroelution. DNA fragments were purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform and pre-

SV40 DNA fragments were equilibrated with OI without drug in 0.01 M-Tris.HCl. (pH 7.5), QO.5 ~w-KC'I. 5 mi%%-MgCl,. @I mM-EDTA, I mM-ATP. 15 pg bovine serum albumin/ml for 5 min before addition of topoisomerase II (40 to 70 ng in 20 pl final reaction volume). Reactions were stopped by adding SDS to a final concentration of 1y/, (w/v) and proteinase K to 100 fig/ml, followed by incubation for 1 h at 42°C. For agarose gel analysis. 3 ~1 of 10 x loading buffer (@30/; (w/v) bromophenol blue. 167, (w/v) Ficoll. @Ol M-Na,HPO,) was added to each sample. which was then heated at 65°C for 1 to 2 min before loading ont,o an agarose gel made in TBE buffer (89 mM-Tris-borate (pH 8), 2 mM-EDTA: Capranico et al., 199Oa: Fesen PC Pommier, 1989; Pommier et al., 1990). Agarose gel electrophoresis was at 2 V/cm overnight. The gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper sheets and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR-5 film. For DNA sequence analysis, samples were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 2.5 ~1 of loading buffer (80% (v/v) formamide. 10 mM-NaOH, 1 mM-EDTA, @l T/b xylene cyanol, 0.1 ?10 bromophenol blue). Samples were heated to 90°C and immediately loaded onto DNA sequencing gels (8 "/b polyacrylamide: 29 : 1 (w/w) acrylamide to bisacrylamide) containing 7 M-urea in TBE buffer. Electrophoresis was at 1500 V (60 W) for 2 to 3 h. (d) Qenomic mappkg of DNA hrc>alcs

The genomic localization of drug-induced topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks was determined as described (Capranico et al., 1990a,b; Fesen & Pommier. 1989; Pommier et aZ., 1990). Briefly, autoradiography films were scanned with a DU-8B Beckman spectrophotometer set at' 555 nm, and the position and absorbance values were transmitted to a computer. 32P-end-labeled

digested lambda DNA was usually run as HindIII-EcoRI DNA markers in 4 lanes/gel to check the uniformity of DNA migration throughout the gel. Regression lines of the logarithm of the fragment size (in base-pairs) versus the migration distance of each fragment from a reference line were determined for the DNA markers. Regression

coefficients were consistently near 999. Each autoradiography lane was analyzed by using the same reference line and the size of each DNA fragment induced by topoisomerase II was computed. The reproducibility of fragment size determinations in different gels was usually within 50 bp.

3. Results
(a) Double-strand cleavage patterns the SV40 genome in

The RV40 genome was mapped for double-strand cleavage induced by topoisomerase IT in the presence or absence of several types of drugs (Figs 2 and 3). In the absence of drug. cleavage occurred most prominently in the nuclear matrix-associated region (MAR) and to a lesser extent in several other regions. m-AMSA intensified the cleavage in all regions affected by the enzyme alone. and stimulated cleavage in other regions that were not detectably affected in the absence of drug. VM-26, 2methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium and 5-iminodaunorubicin each produced a distinctive pattern of enhanced cleavage. Some peaks in the cleavage patterns coincided for different drugs or with peaks generated by the enzyme alone. However, the most consistent region of cleavage that was prominent in all cases was the MAR. Among the three types of drugs examined, the anthraaycline 5-iminodaunorubicin produced the greatest selectivity of enhanced cleavage, most' prominently in the MAR and near nucleotide 1500. The regions of the replicat,ion origin and the early t,ranscription enhancers, nucleotides 1 to 250, exhlbited relatively little cleavage in the presence or absence of any of the drugs tested (Fig. 3).

Sites of cleavage in the MAR were determined at, the nucleotide level in both the coding and the noncoding strands of the early message. In the coding strand. cleavage was observed in t.he absence of drug at positions 4309,4268,4251? 4247.4208,4143. 4129 and 4118 (Fig. 4). These sites were cleaved very rapidly and exhibited equal int,ensities at one and 30 minutes of reaction. VM-26 exhibited the highest frequency of cleavage sites among the drugs tested. Cleavage enhancements by this drug appeared within one minute, but most sites increased progressively in int'ensity at the three and 30 minute time points. With m-AMSA. some sites increased progressively in intensity (posit*ions 4331 1 4317,4311, 4265 and 4169), while others were strong at one minute and then decreased in intensity (positions 4334, 4286, 4268, 4221, 4214, 4203, 4197, 4143 and 4106). In the non-coding strand of the MAR, cleavage in the absence of drug usually occurred at the sites expected from the dyad symmetry of double-strand cleavage by topoisomerase II (Figs 5 and 6). the mapping of t,opoFigure 6 summarizes isomerase II-induced DNA cleavage sites on both strands of the SV40 MAR. Arrows and numbers correspond to the base covalent'ly linked to the enzyme. Cleavage sites corresponding to doublestrand breaks should be staggered by four bp with a 5'-overhang (Liu et al., 1983; Sander &, Hsieh, 1983).

Symmetrical cleavage of the caomplementary strands also owurred for most of the sites stimulated by m-AMSA (Fig. 5 and data not shown). The distribution of the m-AMSA-stimulated sites within t,he MAR region was non-random and showed evidence of clustering with a periodic interval of approximately 65 nucleotides (Fig. 7).

Figure 6. Topoisomerase II-induced DNA cleavage sites on both strands of the SV40 MAR. Arrows and numbers correspond to the base covalently linked to the enzyme. The size of the arrows is proportional to cleavage intensity.

The same region has been shown to reconstitute phased nucleosomes with an interval of 120 to 140 nucleotides (Capranico et al., 1990a).

(c) Kinetic switch betweenneighboring cleavagesites
Site switching was observed with m-AMSA at two locations (4268+4266 and 4167+4169, lower strand of Fig. 6), where cleavage appeared rapidly at one site and then declined at the same time that cleavage appeared at a site two base-pairs away (Fig. 4 and other experiments not shown). Cleavage on the upper strand showed a corresponding switch from position 4265 to position 4263 (Fig. 5, upper panel), and the kinetics of switching at the corresponding sites on opposite strands were similar. This suggests that at 3O"C, the enzyme homodimer moved along the DNA from positions 426514268 (cleavage without drug) to positions 426314266 (with m-AMSA). The movement was temperaturedependent, requiring three minutes at 3O"C, seven minutes at 20°C and 240 minutes at 10°C (Fig. 8). The kinetics of switching also depended upon mAMSA concentration (Fig. 4). No site switching was observed with VM-26, which only intensified

cleavage with time and never showed decreasing cleavage with time. Because topoisomerase II-DNA complexes cover at least 15 bp on each side of their cleavage sites (Lee et aE., 1989), two different complexes could not coexist simultaneously at sites 426514268 and 42631 4266 on the same DNA molecule. Hence, the m-AMSA-induced switch must involve the movement of the enzyme to a more stable position nearby. After resealing the original strands, the enzyme either moves by sliding while remaining bound to the DNA, or by dissociating from the DNA and reassociating at the new location. (d) Stability of the association of

topoisomerase with DNA II
The possibility of a dissociation-reassociation process was tested by adding a 50-fold excess of unlabeled DNA to a topoisomerase II reaction mixture containing labeled DNA and 10 ,uM-m-AMSA (Fig. 9). The addition of unlabeled DNA prior to the addition of enzyme completely prevented detectable cleavage of the labeled DNA. However, when added 20 seconds after the enzyme, the unlabeled DNA had no effect on cleavage kin-

etics, and the switch between neighboring sites occurred normally. These results indicate that II-DNA m-AMSA-induced topoisomerase complexes were very stable and did not dissociate from the DNA under these conditions. Therefore, the most' likely explanation for the switching between neighboring sites is that the enzyme homodimer moves from the first site to the second without dissociation from the DNA. Tn the absence of m-AMSA, however, the addition of excess unlabeled DNA 30 seconds after the enzyme did partially reduce DNA cleavage (Fig. 9(c)). The extent of DNA cleavage decreased with increasing m-AMSA concentration, showing that m-AMSA stabilizes the binding between topoisomerase II and DNA.

In the absence of drug, very little cleavage was detected in the region of the replication origin and the early transcription enhancers (nucleotides 1 to 250: Fig. 10). VM-26, m-AMSA and 2-methyl-ghydroxyellipticinium induced distinctive patterns of cleavage in t'his region, although the aggregate intensities were low compared to other regions of the genome (Fig. 3). 5-Iminodaunorubicin, however. induced no significant cleavage in this region. Comparative analysis of drug effects in the t'wo 72 bp repeats showed cleavage at corresponding positions and with similar intensities in each of the repeats (Figs 10 and 11). There were, however, noticeable differences near the boundaries of the indicating an influence of DNA base repeats, sequence at a distance of at least 10 bp from the

The region near the midpoint of the HV-CO genome (near nucleotide 2620) is of interest because it is the region of transcription termination and t'he region where replication is completed prior to the separation of daughter genomes (Weaver et ~,l., 19X5). Topoisomerase II may function in t,his region to allow the daught'er genomes to separate (Snapka,. 1986; Yang et al.. 1987). and specific binding of topoisomerase TI to a DNA bend in this region has been demonstrated (Howard it al., 1991). Sequencing analysis showed several intense cleavage sites in the absence of drug (Fig. 12. lane K), and the induction of a large number of additional sites by m-AMSA and VM-26 (lanes E and G). Tn order to show better the position of the m-AMRA-induced cleavage site, a, low exposure of lane E from Figure 12 was scanned (Fig. 13). Almost all the sites coincided with an A and those that did not were ai T, indicating preference for ( + 1 )A (or T). The DNA structure of the termination region exhibits some interesting features. First, it contains t'wo 12 bp tandem repeats starting at positions 2600 and 2629 (underlined sequences in Fig. 13). Although each repeat was cleaved at similar positions. cleavage intensity was much greater in the second than in the first repeat. indicating an influence of flanking region contains sequences.

4. Discussion
The SV40 genome was surveyed for double-strand cleavage induced by topoisomerase II using nondenaturing agarose gel electrophoresis to map regional cleavage intensity. The regional stimulatory effects of anti-tumor drugs were determined. Four drugs of chemically different classes were studied and, as expected, each stimulated a distinctive pattern of cleavage (Figs 2 and 3). Consistently strong cleavage with all of the drugs, as well as in the absence of drug, was however observed in the vicinity of bases 4100 to 4300, which have been identified as the nuclear matrix associated region (MAR) of SV40 (Pommier et al., 1990). Since topoisomerase II is a major constituent of the nuclear matrix (Berrios et al., 1985), the binding of the MAR to the nuclear matrix could be via the topoisomerase. The drugs enhance covalent binding between topoisomerase and DNA in complexes in which one or both DNA strands are cleaved (Liu, 1989; Pommier & Kohn, 1989). Although drugs of different structural classesshow diverse patterns of DNA cleavage, derivatives within a given structural class generally show similar patterns (Capranico et al., 199Ob;Pommier et al., 1987; Tewey et aZ., 1984). The drug that showed the greatest selectivity for

cleavage in the MAR was 5-iminodaunorubicin, a close relative of doxorubicin, which is one of the most effective known anti-tumor drugs. Doxorubicin and other anthracyclines were previously found to produce double-strand cleavage selectively in the SV40 MAR (Capranico et al., 1990b); the current findings show that this selectivity is not shared by m-AMSA or VM-26. Mapping at the DNA sequence level in the MAR revealed multiple cleavage sites that were often at different although nearby sites for the different drugs. Sequence locations were determined in both strands in the absenceof drug and in the presence of m-AMSA: except for some of the weakest sites, all sites were paired as expected from the dyad symmetry of topoisomerase II double-strand breaks (4 bp stagger with 5'-overhang). We do not have proof, however, that the paired breaks on opposite strands are always (or even usually) present simultaneously in the same DNA molecule. Two of the strongest MAR sites (424814251 and 426514268) occurred in the sequence5'-TTATAA-3', another (4126/4129) at the sequence5'-AATATT-3, and the other strong sites were also at sequences containing alternating AT (Fig. 6). Similar alternating AT sequences in the immunglobulin MAR have been implicated in nuclear matrix attachment (Cockerill & Garrard, 1986), and other "AT boxes" have been identified in a variety of nuclear scaffold binding sites (Izaurralde et al., 1988; Mirkovitch et al., 1988). Taken together, these findings suggest

and, perhaps, a more open structure in these A + T-rich regions allows them to be enzyme binding sites.
Preferential the cleavage in the absence of drug or in

presence of m-AMSA or VM-26 was also observed in the SV40 termination region, where two sites (2646 and 2652) were within an AT box,

and reassociation at a different site, because the intensity changes were unaffected by the addition of excess unlabeled DNA one minute after the start of the reaction. Among the most intense m-AMSAenhanced sites, a pair of similar intensity separated by two bp, exhibited complementary kinetics: while the intensity of cleavage at one of the sites increased
with time, the intensity of the other exhibited a

Topoisomerase II action here may represent sites where the enzyme decatenates newly synthesized SV40 circles at the end of replication. Surprising kinetic diversity was observed among drug-stimulated cleavage sites. The rates of formation of cleavage varied from site to site and from drug t'o drug. In the case of m-AMSA, some cleavage
sites time, appearing usually decreasing with time while the intensity of other sites continued to increase (Fig. 4). No biphasic site was observed with were biphasic with

within one minute and then

decrease. The corresponding complementary behavior was suggestive of a switch with time from one site to another. This switch involved doublestrand cleavage complexes, since similar events were seen at dyad equivalent sites on both strands (from 4265 to 4263 on the upper strand of Fig. 6 and from 4268 to 4266 on the lower strand). This processwas not prevented by excess competitor DNA, indicating that the enzyme does not dissociate after the initial DNA binding. Therefore, the topoisomerase II homodimer may be able to move
along the DrVA from one site to another. Other biphasic sites were further separated from the

VM-26, although the cleavage of different sites increased at different rates. The intensity changes are not due to the complete dissociation of enzyme

nearest continuous sites, suggesting that the enzyme may be able to move longer distances along the DNA.
