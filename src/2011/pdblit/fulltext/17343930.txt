Abstract--One current vaccine candidate against Plasmodium vivax targeting asexual blood stage is the major merozoite surface protein-1 of P. vivax (PvMSP-1). Vaccine trials with PvMSP-119 and PvMSP-133 have succeeded in protecting monkeys and a large proportion of individuals, naturally exposed to P. vivax transmission, develop specific antibodies to PvMSP-119. This study presents a model for the three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal 19 kDa fragment of P. vivax MSP-1 determined by means of homology modeling and molecular dynamics refinement. The structure proved to be consistent with MSP-119 of known crystal or solution structures. The presence of a main binding pocket, well suited for protein­protein interactions, was determined by CASTp. Corrections reported to the sequence of PvMSP-119 Belem strain were also inspected. Our model is currently used as a basis to understand antibody interactions with PvMSP-119. Ó 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Despite significant efforts over the past 50 years to control malaria, the disease continues to be a major health problem in the tropical world. Human malaria is caused by four Plasmodium species, namely, P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. While P. falciparum prevails on the African continent where is primarily blamed for the mortality associated with malaria,1 Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread of the four Plasmodium species; it accounts for more than 50% of all malaria cases outside Africa and is responsible for significant morbidity in Central and South America, South-east and South Asia, Papua New Guinea, and parts of Africa with a yearly estimate of 80 million cases.2 Vaccines to afford protection against P. falciparum and P. vivax are urgently required. However, the development of an effective malaria vaccine has been challenged by the biological and molecular complex-

ity of Plasmodium parasites and, not less important, because protective immunity to malaria is poorly understood. Clinical symptoms of malaria are attributed to the blood-stages of the parasite life cycle ensuing repeated rounds of erythrocyte invasion, intracellular multiplication, and lysis of host erythrocytes. An effective vaccine against the erythrocytic stages of malaria parasites would be expected to limit parasite multiplication rates and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality and spreading of drug resistant parasites. Proteins on the surface of the merozoite (MSP) have been considered a prime target for a blood stage malaria vaccine since they are exposed to potentially effective immune mechanism leading to interruption of the parasite blood cycle. Ten members of the MSP family have been described in P. falciparum (PfMSP1-10)3­10 of which, eight have been recognized in P. vivax (PvMSP-1, PvMSP-185, PvMSP-3a, PvMSP-3b, PvMSP3c, PvMSP-4, PvMSP-5, PvMSP-8, PvMSP-9, and PVMSP-10).11­17 Among the MSP family, MSP-1 is a leading vaccine candidate.18,19 Studies performed mainly in P. falciparum indicate that MSP-1 is processed by proteolytic cleavage at, or just prior to, merozoite release into 83, 30, 38, and 42 kDa fragments.20­22 Before completion of erythrocyte invasion,

the C-terminal 42 kDa fragment, attached to the merozoite surface, is further processed into 33 and 19 kDa fragments with only the 19 kDa fragment being carried into the newly infected erythrocyte.20,23,24 The 19 kDa polypeptide enclosed two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and monoclonal antibodies binding MSP-119 has the ability to inhibit the invasion of erythrocytes in vitro.23,25­27 Immunization with MSP142 and MSP119 have shown to provide partial immunity against the blood stages of P. falciparum in Aotus monkeys.19,28,29 Homologue PvMSP-1, a 200 kDa protein expressed on the surface of P. vivax merozoite,11 is also a current vaccine candidate against asexual blood stage. Immunization of Saimiri monkeys with a PvMSP119 recombinant fragment derived from the Sal-1 strain of P. vivax provided partial protection against P. vivax homologous challenge30,31 and Aotus monkeys immunized with a mixture of recombinant polypeptides encoding the PvMSP-1 33 kDa fragment of the P. vivax Belem strain developed partial protection against a heterologous strain challenge.32 Studies on the naturally acquired humoral immune responses against PvMSP-1 showed that PvMSP-119 is the most immunogenic portion of the molecule, being recognized by 64% of the patients from endemic regions in the Brazilian Amazone.33 Albeit MSP-119 has long been regarded as a clue component of a MSP-1 malaria-based vaccine, it has been argued that MSP-119 has limited T cell epitopes,34 MSP-142 being probably a better vaccine since immunodominant T cell epitopes may be located in the upstream 33 kDa fragment.34 Interestingly, PfMSP-142 vaccine provided better protection than PfMSP-119 against blood stage challenge in Aotus monkeys.19 Recent studies with polypeptides (rPvMSP-114 and rPvMSP-120) contained in the 33 kDa fragment located within PvMSP-142 indicated that protection against a P. vivax blood stage challenge was best achieved when immunizing with a rPvMSP-114-rPvMSP-120 mixture.32 Molecular modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the MSP-1 C-terminal fragment of P. vivax could provide a better understanding of how molecular structure relates to biological activity. For example, the structure could assist in the prediction of T and B cell epitopes, help in the identification of prominent antibody binding sites, and anticipate the effect of mutation on immunogenicity using a structure-based approach. To date, the crystal structures of the C-terminal domains of PcMSP-1

(P. cynomolgi),35 PkMSP-1 (P. knowlesi)36, and the solution structure of PfMSP-1 (P. falciparum),37 have been reported. These studies confirmed the presence of two EGF-like domains and revealed the compact integral entity formed by these two domains. The C-terminal region of MSP-1, which represents a conserved segment within this variable molecule, shows high sequence identity within Plasmodium species: P. vivax shares 84% sequence identity with P. cynomolgi, 81% with P. knowlesi, and 54% sequence identity with P. falciparum. Here, we propose a model for the three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal fragment of P. vivax MSP1, determined by homology modeling and molecular dynamics refinement. The structural data presented provide a useful comparison between the model of PvMSP-119 and the previously reported structures of this fragment. Corrections reported by Putaporntip et al.38 for the PvMSP-1 Belem strain sequence described by del Portillo11 are also discussed. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Homology modeling of PvMSP-119 The structure of the C-terminal 19 kDa fragment of PvMSP-1 (Belem strain, Q02569) was obtained from homology modeling simulations. The sequence of PvMSP-119 was aligned with the MSP-119 sequences of which the crystal or solution structures are known; these include P. cynomolgi, P. knowlesi, and P. falciparum. The structure of PcMSP-119 was selected as template to generate the model due to its high sequence identity with that of PvMSP-119. The alignment reported in Figure 1 revealed a high degree of homology and identity between the different species of plasmodia. The alignment of EGFlike domain one, defined from Met-1 to Val-42 for PvMSP-119, and of domain two, defined from Thr-48 to Ser-91, is observed. Between the Asp-66 and Ser-67 residues there is a segment that is larger in P. falciparum. Alignments of the cysteines that typically form the disulfide bonds in the EGF-like domains are also shown. Five models were generated and inspected. The model showing the best score, as judged by the value of the Modeler objective function, and with the least rms deviation with respect to trace (Ca atoms) of the crystal

structure of PcMSP-119 used as template, was saved for further refinement and validation. The models were also compared between themselves to identify possible variable regions in the PvMSP-119. These were identified between residues Pro-43 and Val-47, located in the interdomain linker region and between residues Thr-65 and Lys-69, which belong to the flexible segment in domain two, mentioned above. Additionally, most of the amino acid differences between the C-terminal fragments of the reported protein structures are located in these two regions. In the X-ray structure of PcMSP-119,35 a unique conformation for the main chain of the hairpin turn could not be proposed, suggesting that this region is highly flexible, a question which was answered in the solution structure of PfMSP-119.37 Furthermore, both regions appear to be the most variable ones among different species of plasmodia.40,41 Further refinement was performed in order to obtain the best conformation on the whole PvMSP-119 structure resulting from Modeler, as described in Section 4. The quality of the refined PvMSP-119 structure thus obtained was checked with ProStat/Structure_Check. The structure satisfied the tests; in the Ramachandran plot, 74.2% of the residues were in the most favored regions. The PvMSP-119 structure superimposes with the PcMSP-119 crystal structure used as template with a ° rms deviation of 0.7 A for 79 Ca atoms (Table 1). 2.2. Description of the structure and comparison across species The overall folding of PvMSP-119 is very similar to that previously reported for other C-terminal fragments of MSP-1 and a comparison was made between the generated model and those structures (Table 1). The structure of PcMSP-119 superimposes on the PvMSP-119 model with the rms mentioned above, the PkMSP-119 structure ° with an rms deviation of 1.1 A, whereas the PfMSP-119 ° structure superimposes with an rms deviation of 3.2 A. In all cases 79 Ca atoms were considered. The results show the highly similar three-dimensional structures of the molecule. Figure 2a shows the modeled PvMSP-119 demonstrating the preservation of the structural features of the protein, the disc-shaped form of the molecule with most of their residues accessible to solvent, and the two domains which are structurally related to the EGF motif. Each EGF-like domain contains a major stretch of anti-parallel b-sheet (b1 and b2) including the third and fourth cysteine residues of the EGF motif, and an additional

of PvMSP-119. These amino acid side chains are represented as ball and stick, protruding from the main chain represented as a solid ribbon. The amino acid differences between the proteins occur mainly in the inter-domain region and in the region that corresponds to the flexible hairpin turn. The variability of the latest one was discussed above. The two EGF domains present in the structure are intimately associated and form a U-shaped structure. The EGF motif is present in a large spectrum of extracellular proteins with widely varying roles in biological processes.42 Typically, EGF-like domains consist of 40­50 residues with six cysteines in three disulfide bonds with a connectivity of 1­3, 2­4, and 5­6. The 2­4 cysteine is centrally located within the EGF motif, while the 1­3 and 5­6 cysteines secure the N- and C-terminal ends of the domain, respectively. The residues that would form the 2­4 disulfide bridge of the EGF motif are different from cysteine in domain 1 of all plasmodia MSP-119, except for that of P. falciparum.36 The disulfide is replaced with tryptophan and a smaller residue, a valine, isoleucine or threonine. Moreover, of all the independent EGF/laminin-like domain structures currently in the Protein Data Bank,43 only Plasmodia MSP-119 have lost one of its three canonical disulfide bonds. The loss of a structurally important and highly conserved disulfide bond should be most likely due to a functional requirement not yet well understood. Consequently, the two domains of PvMSP-119 model were compared with those present in the crystal and NMR structures available. A comparison of the two domains ° gives an rms deviation range of 0.6­1.9 A between ° equivalent a carbons for domain 1, and 0.7­1.6 A for domain 2 (Table 2). The domains are similar between the four structures with differences mainly for P. falciparum. The two domains of PvMSP-119 model, which have 19% of sequence homology, superimpose with an rms ° deviation of 3.1 A for 24 Ca atoms, a value that falls within the structural variability of the EGF motif. A careful comparison around the residues that substitute cysteines 2 and 4 in domain 1 was performed. The distances between the Ca and Cb atom pairs in Val-12 and Trp-28 residues that replace cysteines 2 and 4 range ° ° between 6.3­6.8 A and 5.1­5.3 A, respectively, in the PvMSP-119 model and the reported crystal structures, while the corresponding distances for the 2­4 disulfide ° bridge present in the PfMSP-119 are 5.2 and 3.3 A, respectively. These shorter distances afford a compact structure to this domain in PfMSP-119. However, in spite of the absence of the 2­4 disulfide bridge, the EGF fold is maintained. Superposition of the reported

crystal structures with the PvMSP-119 model (Fig. 3a) shows a high similarity around Trp-28. The crystal structures have an amino acid residue bound between Glu-36 and Trp-28, histidine in PkMSP-119 and lysine in PcMSP-119, while in our model it is absent, in consequence Glu-36 has a different orientation. This region appears to be a main binding pocket, well suited for protein­protein interactions, if we considered that the analysis of the CASTp39 results show that this is the largest ° pocket found on our model (154.6 A3) (Fig. 3b). The residues comprising the pocket of PvMPS-119 are Trp28, Arg-29, and Cys-30, in b2 strand, Phe-34 in loop, Lys-35 and Glu-36, in b3 strand, Asn-52, Gly-55, and Cys56, in loop, and Val-86 in loop. This region in domain 1 is particularly interesting because of two reasons:

(1) several growth inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAb) bind to the first EGF domain of the PfMSP119,44 (2) for some of these antibodies a target epitope has been located on the N-terminal EGF-like domain of the PfMSP-119.45 2.3. Analysis of the corrections to the sequence of PvMSP-119 The structure of the PvMSP-119 herein described was based on the protein sequence published by del Portillo et al.11 for the Belem strain. However, to date several corrections to this sequence, some of them within the C-terminal 19 kDa fragment, have been reported.38 Therefore, the implication of these corrections on the structure of the PvMSP-119 was analyzed. Of the 91 residues, two were substituted, Met-25 with threonine in domain 1, and Gly-44 with alanine in the inter-domain linker region, shown in Figure 4. Met-25 appears to be in a well-structured side chain region, at the beginning of the b2-sheet in domain 1, surface-exposed, and is not involved in interactions across the inter-domain interface. Residue 25, threonine in P. cynomolgy and P. knowlesi, makes hydrogen bond to main chain amide nitrogen atom of residue Tyr-21. In our model, the hydrogen bond between Met-25 and the corresponding tyrosine residue is also present. Superposition between the PvMSP-119 model and the crystal structures of PcMSP-119 and PkMSP-119 indicated that the displacement of the methionine residue by threonine on the PvMSP-119 model can be performed with minimum perturbation of the conformation in domain 1 of PvMSP119 and the side chain of threonine could account for a similar orientation as that of methionine (Fig. 5a). The second displacement, Gly-44 with alanine, is conservative and occurs in the extended polypeptide segment that makes the transition from domain 1 to domain 2. In the crystal structures of PcMSP-119 and PkMSP-119, a hydrogen bond is present between residue 44, alanine in both structures, and residue 33, tyrosine in P. cynomolgy and glycine in P. knowlesi. The displacement mentioned above apparently does not disturb the ability to make hydrogen bond between residue 44 and the side

chain of Thr-33 in the PvMSP-119 structure (Fig. 5b). These results may be considered for further experimental studies on identification of potential B-cell epitopes. 3. Conclusions The three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal 19 kDa fragment of P. vivax MSP-1 was built by using the homology modeling based on the known crystal structure of P. cynomolgy MSP-119. Then, the model structure was refined by energy minimization and molecular dynamics methods. Our model reveals the presence of a main binding pocket in domain 1, well suited for protein­protein interactions. Corrections reported by Putaporntip et al.38 for the PvMSP-1 Belem strain sequence described by del Portillo et al.11 were also inspected, and corrections can be introduced with minimum perturbation of the conformation in domain 1 and in the extended polypeptide segment that makes the transition from domain 1 to domain 2. The model thus obtained, the analysis of the potential hydrophilic regions, corrections to the sequence, and the proposed main binding pocket in domain 1, are under consideration for the identification of several potential B-cell epitopes. Studies are under way to examine interaction between relevant peptides and antibodies from individuals largely exposed to P. vivax malaria. 4. Theory and methods Modeling studies as well as the generation and analysis of the structures were performed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 workstation. The modeling, calculation of energy minimization, molecular dynamics, and analysis of the three-dimensional models were performed using Insight II, the Modeler, Discover, Analysis, and Decipher packages (Molecular Simulations Inc., Walthman, M.A.). The CASTp39 server was used for identification of the binding site. Molecular figures were prepared using the Insight II and WebLab ViewerLite 3.20. The program DeepView/SwissPdb-Viewer 3.7 (GlaxoSmithKline) was also used. 4.1. 3D model building Sequence alignment between C-terminal fragments of PfMSP-1, PkMSP-1, PcMSP-1 (PDB codes 1CEJ, 1N1I, and 1B9W, respectively), and PvMSP-1 (Belem strain) (TrEMBL Accession No. Q02569, GenBank Accession No. AAA63427.1) was generated with the structural alignment tool of the Modeler module of Insight II and corrected manually until a satisfactory placement of conserved blocks and amino acid identities was achieved. The 10 invariant cysteines that would form disulfide bridges of the EGF motifs in PkMSP119,36 PcMSP-119,35 and PvMSP-11911 were considered as restraints when generating the models. Five conformers were generated with Modeler/Insight II using the C-terminal fragment of the PcMSP-119 as template. The models were then analyzed with ProStat/ Structure_Check. Decipher was used to generate

Ramachandran plots. The best model was used as starting structure for a further refinement. The reported corrections38 to the PvMSP-119 Belem sequence published by del Portillo et al.11 were also evaluated. 4.2. Model refinement and evaluation For energy refinement with Discover, hydrogen atoms were added to the model according to pH 7 and partial charges were assigned to all atoms. The calculations were performed by the Discover module of Insight II using the consistent-valence force field (CVFF), with a ° 20 A cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions and a dielectric constant of 1. The best model obtained by ° Modeler was surrounded by a 5 A water shell and energy minimized in order to make it able to undergo molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The water molecules were minimized, while holding de PvMSP-119 fixed, by the steepest descent method, followed by conjugated gradient minimization down to ° 1 kcal molÀ1 AÀ1. After this first step, constraints with ° a force constant of 1000 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 were applied to the backbone atoms (N, Ca, C, O) and gradually ° decreased from 1000 to 2 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2. Conjugated gradient minimizations were carried out until ° 0.5 kcal molÀ1 AÀ1 of convergence on the gradient. Finally, the last step of minimization was performed without any constraints. Subsequently, MD simulations were carried out at 300 K. The system was allowed to equilibrate, followed by a 5 ps molecular dynamics run at 300 K. At the end of the MD simulation, the structure was once again minimized using conjugated gradient energy minimization until the root mean-square (rms) ° gradient energy was lower than 0.1 kcal molÀ1 AÀ1. The final model was checked with ProStat. The ProStat module of Insight II identifies and lists the number of instances where structural features differ significantly from the average values calculated from known proteins. 4.3. Identification of the binding site of PvMSP-119 In this study, the CASTp39 server was used for the identification of the main binding site in our model of PvMSP-119. CASTp provides identification and analytical measurements of surface accessible pockets, for proteins and other molecules, which can be used to guide protein­protein interactions. Through comparison of the reported structures of P. cynomolgi, P. knowlesi, and P. falciparum, we can predict the main binding site of PvMSP-119.
