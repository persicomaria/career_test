[30] TyrosylDNA Phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) (30 Phosphotyrosyl DNA Phosphodiesterase)
By AMY C. RAYMOND and ALEX B. BURGIN, JR.
Abstract

TyrosylDNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) hydrolyzes 30 phosphotyrosyl bonds in vitro. Because topoisomerase I, a type IB topoisomerase, is the only enzyme known to form 30 phosphotyrosine bonds in eukaryotic cells, it was proposed that Tdp1 is involved in the repair of deadend topoisomerase IDNA covalent complexes that may form in vivo. It has also been proposed that Tdp1 may represent a novel anticancer target since known anticancer agents (e.g., camptothecin) act by stabilizing topoisomerase IDNA covalent adducts. The importance of Tdp1 in DNA repair is also demonstrated by the observation that a recessive mutation in the human TDP1 gene is responsible for the hereditary disorder Spinocerebellar Ataxia with Axonal Neuropathy (SCAN). Although it has been proposed that Tdp1 may be involved in the repair of multiple DNA lesions, this chapter describes the synthesis and characterization of substrates used to study the role of Tdp1 in repairing topoisomerase IDNA adducts, and the methods used to study the catalytic mechanism and structure of this novel enzyme.
Introduction

TyrosylDNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) is the only known enzyme to repair covalent proteinDNA adducts. Tdp1 was serendipitously discovered as a contaminating activity in a commercial preparation of 30 terminal deoxynucleotide transferase. Preparations of Tdp1 with extremely high specific activity, lacking any transferase activity, could be purified from a variety of eukaryotic sources but not in sufficient quantities to allow direct sequencing. However, characterization of this activity showed that it specifically hydrolyzed 30 phosphotyrosyl bonds with nanomolar affinity and would not hydrolyze 50 phosphotyrosyl or 30 phosphoseryl bonds (Yang et al., 1996). Because a variety of DNA lesions and other agents (including the chemotherapeutic agent camptothecin) were known to stabilize 30 phosphotyrosine linkages between topoisomerase I and DNA, the observed enzymatic activity led to the proposition that Tdp1 is involved in the repair of deadend topoisomerase IDNA complexes in vivo. Topoisomerase I, a type IB topoisomerase, is the only enzyme known to form

a transient 30 phosphotyrosine linkage with DNA in eukaryotic cells (Champoux, 2001). Genetic evidence for the role of Tdp1 in DNA repair was provided when the gene encoding Tdp1 was identified from a camptothecin sensitive strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pouliot et al., 1999). The results from this and subsequent studies have identified multiple pathways for repair of stalled Topoisomerase IDNA complexes in yeast (Liu et al., 2002, 2004; Pouliot et al., 2001). Less is known about the analogous repair pathways in higher eukaryotes; however, a recessive mutation in the human TDP1 gene was found to be responsible for the hereditary disorder spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (Takashima et al., 2002). It remains unclear why the terminally differentiated cells of these patients are affected by the point mutant Tdp1. Biochemical analysis of the mutant Tdp1, however, leaves no doubt that DNA repair is also affected (Interthal et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005). It should be noted that it has been proposed that Tdp1 is also in involved membrane localization, although no biological substrate has been identified (Dunlop et al., 2004). The in vitro characterization of human and yeast Tdp1 supports its role in DNA repair, including crystal structures of human Tdp1 bound to DNA and tyrosine through the phosphodiester mimic vanadate (Davies et al., 2003; Raymond et al., 2004). This chapter describes the biochemical tools used to study Tdp1 as a DNA repair enzyme.
Tdp1

Tdp1 is a member of the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily of enzymes and uses a twostep catalytic mechanism to cleave 30 phosphotyrosyl bonds. In the first transesterification step, a catalytic histidine displaces tyrosine and generates a covalent 30 phosphohistidine Tdp1DNA intermediate. Free Tdp1 and 30 phosphate DNA is generated in the second hydrolysis step (Fig. 1). An alignment of Tdp1 family members shows that all members share a common Cterminal domain that is homologous to other PLD family members; however, many Tdp1 homologs contain a variable Nterminal domain that varies in both size and amino acid identity. The function of this variable Nterminal domain is not known; however, the lack of conservation suggests that this region is not critical for Tdp1 function. In support of this assumption, full length human Tdp1 and Tdp1 lacking the first 148 residues (Tdp1 Á148) have both been expressed in E. coli, and the proteins have identical specific activities on DNA substrates containing a single 30 phosphotyrosine residue (see DNA substrates later). The majority of biochemical studies of Tdp1 have been carried out using this Nterminal deletion. It is also important to note that crystal structures of both the yeast (1Q32) and human enzymes (1QZQ) do

not contain this variable domain, and repeated efforts at crystalizing the fulllength human enzyme have been unsuccessful. As expected, the crystal structures of Tdp1 closely resemble the structures determined for other members of the PLD family, with an  sandwich composed of two  domains that are related by a pseudo2fold axis of symmetry.
DNA Substrates

30 Phosphotyrosine DNA Tdp1 activity was first observed using oligonucleotide substrates containing a single 30 phosphotyrosine residue. These substrates are prepared by synthesizing the oligonucleotide from tyrosine derivatized resin (Fig. 2) based on a method originally developed by Pan et al. (1993). The resin is first derivatized by adding 0.69 g (1.5 mmol) of Fmoctbutyltyrosine in 10 ml dry dichloromethane (Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 0.018 g (0.15 mmol) dimethylaminopyridine in 1 ml dry dichloromethane, and then 0.31 g (1.5 mmol) of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) in 1 ml dry dichloromethane to 0.52 g (0.015 mmol) resin (TentaGel S OH; Rapp Polymere ¨ GmbH, Tubingen, Germany). Great care should be taken to ensure that all reagents are anhydrous and transferred under argon. The slurry is stirred at room temperature under argon for 2 h, and then washed sequentially with 10 ml dichloromethane, 10 ml acetonitrile, 10 ml dimethylformamide, 10 ml methanol, and then dried in vacuo. The tbutyl protecting group is removed

FIG. 2. 30 phosphotyrosyl DNA substrate. Unmodified resin and Fmoctbutyltyrosine are shown on the left. The resin is derivatized with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and a free tyrosine hydroxyl is generated by treatment with a strong acid (TFA). DNA synthesis from the free tyrosine, and subsequent base deprotection (NH4OH) generates 30 phosphotyrosyl DNA.

to expose the tyrosine hydroxyl by adding 0.2 ml 50% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dimethylformamide to the resin at room temperature for 10 min. Finally, the resin is washed sequentially with 5 ml dimethylformamide, 5 ml acetonitrile, 5 ml dichloromethane, and then dried in vacuo. The derivatized resin is divided into 1 mol portions for synthesis, and the oligonucleotide synthesis is performed without any modification to standard protocols. The final deprotection step (using concentrated NH4OH at 55 for 12 h) hydrolyzes the ester bond linking the tyrosine to the resin thereby generating the 30 phosphotyrosyl DNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 2). There is no preference for the nucleotide at the 30 end of the oligonucleotide, and the final 30 tyrosine derivatized DNA is usually obtained in 75% yield relative to an unmodified oligonucleotide. In addition to 30 phosphotyrosine DNA substrates, synthetic 30 phosphotyrosyl mimetic substrates have been developed for the mechanistic study of Tdp1. For example, 30 (4nitro)phenyl phosphate and 30 (4 methyl)phenyl phosphate have been used in kinetic analyses of hTdp1 (Raymond et al., 2004). These oligonucleotide substrates, diagrammed in Fig. 3A, share the 30 phenyl structure provided by the 30 phosphotyrosine substrate and presumably occupy a very similar space within the hTdp1 active site. However, the pKa of the leaving groups (4nitrophenol and 4methylphenol/cresol) are significantly different. The lower pKa of 4nitrophenol would be expected to make 30 (4nitro)phenyl phosphate a better substrate for Tdp1. Surprisingly, these substrates have identical apparent secondorder rate constants under standard conditions, suggesting that cleavage of the phosphodiester is not the rate limiting step in the reaction (see Kinetic Analyses later). Each of these substrates can be prepared in a straightforward postsynthetic condensation reaction (Fig. 3B).

The postsynthetic derivatization of 30 phosphate containing oligonucleotides (30 PO4) also has the advantage that a large number of different functional groups can be used to replace the tyrosine leaving group without complicated chemistry to generate different modified resins. As an example, Fig. 3B schematizes the derivatization reaction that produces 30 (4nitro) phenyl phosphate DNA. 30 PO4 DNA is commercially available or can be made using standard methods and 30 phosphate CPG (Glen Research, Sterling, VA). Typically, a 1 mol scale synthesis of oligonucleotide is

prepared for each highefficiency derivatization, while lowefficiency deriviaizations begin with a pool of 4­6 1 mol scale oligonucleotide syntheses. It is not necessary to purify the oligonucleotide before derivatization; following deprotection, the 30 PO4 oligonucleotide is precipitated from ethanol and dried in vacuo immediately before derivatization. 30 (4Methyl)Phenyl Phosphate DNA Resuspend the DNA pellet (1 mol) in 1 ml of 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM 2 morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH 5.5. To the oligonucleotide solution add 1 ml of paracresol saturated acetonitrile. Saturated para cresol can be prepared by adding solid cresol to acetonitrile, shaking at room temperature for 1 h, and then removing insoluble paracresol by centrifugation. Add 0.048 g of 1ethyl3(3dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and shake the two immiscible layers vigorously at 65 to form an emulsion. After 20­24 h, extract the aqueous layer three times with 2 ml each of ethyl acetate and recover the DNA from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation. Because only $5­10% of the 30 phosphate DNA is usually converted to desired product and the 30 phosphate DNA remains after the reaction, the derivatization protocol can be repeated without purification from the precipitated DNA mixture. Typically, the derivatization protocol is repeated three times and 30 (4methyl)phenyl phosphate DNA is obtained in $30% final yield. 30 (4Nitro)Phenyl Phosphate DNA Resuspend the DNA pellet in 250 l of 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM MES pH 5.5. Add 200 l of 3 M 4nitrophenol and then 0.048 g of EDC. Initially two immiscible layers form; however, the reaction will proceed by vigorously shaking the mixture to form an emulsion. The 30 (4nitro)phenyl phosphate DNA (also known as 30 paranitrophenyl phosphate DNA) product of this condensation reaction is photolabile and should be protected from direct light whenever possible. Shake the reaction vigorously for 12­16 h at room temperature. Add 250 l water to the reaction and extract the aqueous layer three times with 500 l ethyl acetate. A mixture of 30 (4nitro)phenyl phosphate DNA product and 30 phosphate DNA starting material can be recovered from the aqueous layer by ethanol precipitation. Typically, $60% of the 30 phosphate DNA starting material is converted to 30 (4nitro)phenyl phosphate DNA product. The final product is stable under neutral and acidic conditions, and is stored at À20 in water. The leaving group liberated by cleavage of a 30 (4nitro)phenyl phosphate oligonucleotide substrate, 4nitrophenol, absorbs 405 nm wavelength

light while the intact substrate does not. This unique chromogenic property can be exploited in a spectrophotometric assay to study the enzymatic reaction in real time (Woodfield et al., 2000). However, because the extinction coefficient of 4nitrophenol is low, this assay requires millimolar concentrations of substrate and is not suitable for many kinetic studies. 30 (4Methylumbelliferone) Phosphate DNA Although 30 phosphotyrosyl and 30 phosphotyrosyl mimetic oligonucleotides can be used to monitor Tdp1 cleavage, fluorescent substrates can be used at a much wider concentration range and are therefore significantly more useful. 4methylumbelliferone phosphate (7hydroxy4 methylcoumarin phosphate) is a well characterized phosphotyrosine mimic used to study tyrosine phosphatases (Avrameas, 1992; Huschtscha et al., 1989; Kupcho et al., 2004). Hydrolysis of the electron withdrawing phosphate group generates fluorescent 4methylumbelliferone. The 4methylumbelliferone linked to DNA through a phosphodiester linkage is not fluorescent; however, Tdp1 efficiently hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond linking the bicyclic tyrosine mimic to DNA to generate fluorescent 4methylumbelliferone (Fig. 4) (Rideout et al., 2004). As with the other tyrosine mimic substrates described previously, 30 (4methylumbelliferone) phosphate DNA (DNAMUP) can be generated from the postsynthetic condensation of 30 phosphate DNA. Resuspend dry 30 PO4 DNA ($1 mol) in 250 l of 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM 2morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH 5.5. To the oligonucleotide solution, sequentially add 0.048 g EDC and 200 l of 2 M

4methylumbelliferone in DMSO. Shake the reaction vigorously at room temperature. The product of this condensation reaction is photosensitive and should be protected from direct light by covering the tube in aluminum foil. After 12 h, add 500 l of water and extract the aqueous layer three times with 500 l each of ethyl acetate and recover the DNA from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation. 30 phospho(4methylumbelliferone) derivatized DNA is usually obtained in 75% yield. Purification of Tdp1 Substrates The 30 derivatized substrates described previously can be purified by PAGE; however, the size of the tyrosine or tyrosine mimetic may be very small relative to the oligonucleotide starting material. This makes the purification of longer derivatized oligonucleotides (>15 mers) very difficult. Anion exchange HPLC using a DNA PAC PA100 4 mm Â 250 mm column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) is routinely used for purifying oligonucleotides as large as 50 nucleotides in length. The column is equilibrated in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, and the DNA is loaded in water at 1 ml/min. The DNA is eluted over a linear gradient of 1 M NaCl over 15 min (1 ml/min.). For all of the substrates described previously, the Tdp1 substrate elutes after the underivatized 30 PO4 DNA. This is surprising since the underivatized DNA (30 PO4) is more negatively charged (­2) than the Tdp1 substrates containing a 30 phosphodiester (­1). Care should be taken not to use a UV detector when purifying DNAMUP since this can cause photobleaching of the 30 phospho(4methylumbelliferone) group. Instead, small portions of the eluted fractions can be inspected for the presence of DNAMUP.
Kinetic Analysis

Regardless of which oligonucleotide substrate is used in the reaction, the second step in the Tdp1 twostep general acid/base reaction generates the tyrosine/tyrosine mimic leaving group, free Tdp1, and 30 phosphate DNA. The smaller size and increased negative charge of this 30 PO4 product makes it readily distinguishable from substrate in denaturing PAGE analysis (Raymond et al., 2004, 2005; Rideout et al., 2004) (Fig. 5). The Tdp1 substrates are 50 end labeled with 32PATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK). It is recommended to use mutant T4 polynucleotide kinase that lacks 30 phosphatase activity (available from New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for labeling Tdp1 substrates. Since Tdp1 generates 30 phosphate DNA, residual T4 PNK in the reactions can generate 30 OH DNA. The 30 OH DNA has less charge and can migrate similarly to the Tdp1 substrate.

FIG. 5. Gelbased analysis of Tdp1 activity. This gel exemplifies the enzyme dependent conversion of 30 derivitized oligonucleotide substrate to 30 phosphate DNA product, which migrates slightly faster on a denaturing PAGE.

Tdp1 enzyme reactions (10­100 l) contain 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 80 mM potassium chloride (KCl), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 400 g/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). Individual time points are quenched by adding an equal volume of 8 M urea, 30% glycerol, 0.05% SDS, 0.25% bromophenol blue. The quenched reactions can be loaded directly onto a 20% polyacrylamide 0.2 mm slab sequencing gel (8 M urea, 0.5Â TBE). As noted previously, the 30 PO4 DNA reaction product has less molecular weight and greater charge than the substrate oligonucleotide, and therefore migrates slightly faster in this denaturing gel system. An example of timedependent cleavage by hTdp1 is shown in Fig. 5. The conversion of Tdp1 substrate to 30 PO4 DNA product can be monitored by phosphorimager analysis of the resulting autoradiogram. The concentration of human Tdp1 in the reaction can vary between 1 pM and 1 nM, and the apparent KM for single and doublestranded oligonucleotides is $100 nM. The enzyme is diluted immediately before use in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 500 g/ ml BSA on ice and added to the reactions at 10Â the desired concentration. Concentrated Tdp1 ($1 mg/ml) is stored in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 50% glycerol at À20 . The enzyme is relatively stable and can be stored for at least 1 year without a decrease in activity. Under these standard conditions, the apparent second order rate constant (kcat / KM) is $1 Â 108 MÀ1 sÀ1. This reflects the rate of cleavage at low substrate concentrations, the expected in vivo condition, and demonstrates that the rate limiting step is enzymesubstrate association; the enzyme is diffusion limited. This is an important feature that is often not appreciated when analyzing Tdp1 mutations. Mutations that slow the rate of catalysis may not slow the overall reaction since the rate limiting step is enzyme­substrate association. When analyzing Tdp1 mutations or screening for inhibitors, it is important to modify the reaction conditions so that the chemical steps of cleavage (transesterification and hydrolysis) become

FIG. 6. Determination of nondiffusionlimited reaction conditions. The kcat and KM values were determined as a function of pH using singlestranded 30 phosphotyrosine substrates. The observed kcat/KM values are plotted as a function of pH, showing a clear drop in secondorder rate constant as the pH of the reaction is lowered.

rate limiting. This can be done easily by lowering the pH of the reaction since all PLD family members use a general acid/base catalytic mechanism. Figure 6 shows that lowering the pH of the reaction results in a corresponding drop in the secondorder rate constant. As described previously, a fluorescent Tdp1 substrate (30 [4methylumbelliferone] phosphate DNA; DNAMUP) has also been developed that allows Tdp1 activity to be monitored in real time. In this assay, reactions containing 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 80 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 40 g/ml BSA, and 10% DMSO are equilibrated to 37 before the reaction is started with the addition of Tdp1. The excitation maximum for the fluorescent reporter methylumbelliferone is 319 nm and the emission maximum is 383 nm. An example of an hTdp1 dependent cleavage reaction is shown in Fig. 7. One disadvantage of this assay is that the fluorescent reporter must be at pH 7.8 or greater. Under these conditions, the apparent second order rate constant for double and singlestranded 30 (4methylumbelliferone) phosphate DNA is close to the rate of diffusion $1 Â 108 MÀ1 secÀ1 and care should be taken when analyzing Tdp1 mutants or inhibitors

DNAMUP (500 nM; filled squares) or 4methylumbelliferone (500 nM; open circles) were incubated in the presence of Tdp1 and the fluorescent signal is plotted as a function of time.

(Rideout et al., 2004). Fortunately, this feature is not a concern during presteady kinetic analysis and this substrate is ideally suited for these applications.
DNA Binding

A conventional method for the study of proteinDNA binding interactions is an electromobility shift assay (EMSA), or gelshift assay. In order to resolve enzymebound DNA from free DNA in the nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, the proteinDNA interaction needs to be stable within the gel during electrophoresis. For reasons that are not known, several laboratories have been unable to observe a gel mobility shift of DNA by yeast or human Tdp1. Even attempts at shifts with enzyme concentrations 100Â the apparent KM of the reaction have been unsuccessful. This prompted the development of a fluorescence anisotropy method to study hTdp1 substrate binding (Raymond et al., 2005). There are a number of considerations in designing a fluorescence anisotropy assay, all of which

522

are covered in great detail elsewhere (Lakowicz, 1999). Fluorescence anisotropy indirectly measures the solution tumbling rate of the fluorescent reporter molecule. Since the tumbling rate is a function of the molecular weight, the fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence polarization methods reflect the proportion of fluorescent population that is bound by enzyme. The chainterminating, 6FAM (6carboxyfluorescein) donating phosphoramidite (Glen Research) is incorporated at the 50 terminal position of the oligonucleotide, which is synthesized using tyrosine derivatized resin as described previously. This results in an oligonucleotide containing a 30 phosphotyrosine residue and a 50 fluorescent reporter. A catalytically inactive enzyme (such as the nucleophile deficient hTdp1 mutant H263A) is used to monitor binding in the absence of catalysis. Data in Fig. 8 shows that increasing Tdp1 concentration results in an increased anisotropic signal as a result of Tdp1 binding to the fluorescent reporter. In this experiment, the equilibrated enzymatic reactions are performed in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0),

FIG. 8. Tdp1 binding affinity of fluoresceinlabeled substrates. Increasing concentrations of catalytically inactive human Tdp1 (H138A) was incubated with fluoresceinlabeled 30 tyrosyl phosphate oligonucleotides (30 Y) and the resultant polarization was measured under equilibrium conditions. In this experiment, singlestranded (ss 30 Y) and double stranded (ds 30 Y) substrates were compared. Nicked and tailed substrates bind hTdp1 weakening and very high concentrations of enzyme do not saturate the polarization signal (for details see Raymond et al., 2004, 2005; Rideout et al., 2004).

5 mM MgCl2, 80 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 40 g/ml BSA at 37 . The reactions should be monitored in black, flatbottom, 96well plates. The excitation and emission maxima of 6FAM are 494 nm and 525 nm wavelengths, respectively. Polarization of the fluorescein reporter has been successfully measured by excitation with vertically polarized light at a wavelength of 485 nm and detection of fluorescence at 520 nm. It is important to note that the spectral properties of 6FAM are pH sensitive and the experiment can only be performed between pH 7.5 and 8.5. When this method is used to determine equilibrium binding constants, it is essential that the reaction be allowed to reach equilibrium before fluorimetry measurements begin. Equilibrium conditions can be determined empirically in pilot experiments by determining the incubation time required for polarization values to plateau.

Abstract

DNA damage repair is essential for the maintenance of genetic integrity in all organisms. Unrepaired or imprecisely repaired DNA can lead to mutagenesis, cell death, or malignant transformation. DNA damage in the form of doublestrand breaks (DSBs) can occur as a result of both exogenous insults, such as ionizing radiation and drug therapies, and normal metabolic processes including V(D)J recombination. Mammalian cells have multiple pathways for repairing DSBs, including nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and singlestrand annealing (SSA). This chapter describes the use of reporter substrates for assaying the contributions of these pathways to DSB repair in mammalian cells, in particular murine embryonic stem cells. The individual contributions of NHEJ, HR, and SSA can be quantified using fluorescence and
