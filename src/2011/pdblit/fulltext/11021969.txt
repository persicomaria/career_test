Abstract Analyzing the pattern of oligonucleotide formation induced by HP-RNase cleavage shows that the enzyme does not act randomly and follows a more endonucleolytic pattern when compared to RNase A. The enzyme prefers the binding and cleavage of longer substrate molecules, especially when the phosphodiester bond that is broken is 8≠11 nucleotides away from at least one of the ends of the substrate molecule. This more endonucleolytic pattern is more appropriate for an enzyme with a regulatory role. Deleting two positive charges on the N-terminus (Arg4 and Lys6) modifies this pattern of external/internal phosphodiester bond cleavage preference, and produces a more exonucleolytic enzyme. These residues may reinforce the strength of a non-catalytic secondary phosphate binding (p2) or, alternatively, constitute a new non-catalytic phosphate binding subsite (p3). ” 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Human pancreatic ribonuclease or RNase 1 (HP-RNase; EC 3.1.27.5)1 is a protein of 128 residues that catalyzes the cleavage of RNA on the 30 -side of pyrimidine bases. It is considered the homologue of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A) in humans [1]. These enzymes share 70% sequence identity and the same active site formed by residues His12, His119 and Lys41. In addition, both operate at an optimal pH of 8.0, show a marked preference for poly(C) over poly(U) and hydrolyze 20 ,30 -cyclic phosphate nucleotides [2]. For RNase A, the base in the nucleotide on the 50 position of the broken bond is important in defining its efficiency, the preference being A > G > C > U [3].

The cleavage mechanism of the phosphodiester bond by RNase A takes place in two independent processes and has been examined in detail [4,5]. In the first step there is a transphosphorylation reaction from the 50 position of one nucleotide to the 20 position of the adjacent nucleotide which forms a 20 ,30 -cyclic phosphate. In the second step the 20 ,30 -cyclic phosphate is hydrolysed to a 30 -nucleotide. There is a lag in the formation of the final product of the reaction, and no 30 -nucleotide appears until all the 30 ,50 phosphodiester bonds have been converted into 20 ,30 -cyclic phosphate nucleotides. It has been shown that HP-RNase, whose catalytic residues are completely conserved and share a common topological distribution with those of RNase A, also accumulates the 20 ,30 -cyclic phosphodiester intermediate during the reaction [5]. This indicates that both enzymes have the same mechanism of catalysis. In addition to the active site, several non-catalytic subsites that contribute to binding of the polymeric substrates in RNase A have been characterized using structural and kinetic approaches (for a review, see [6,7]). The phosphate group of the phosphodiester bond to be cleaved by the

enzyme is placed at the catalytic subsite designed as p1, while the pyrimidine nucleoside binding site located at the 30 position of the cleaved bond is denoted as B1R1. Residues involved in recognising the purine nucleoside at the 50 position of the cleaved bond are designed as B2R2. Other non-catalytic phosphate-binding subsites have been proposed in addition to the active site. Among them, those best characterized are p0 (Lys66) and p2 (Lys7 and Arg10), which bind adjacent phosphates to the one located at p1, in the 50 and 30 directions, respectively. Finally, other phosphate-binding subsites, such as p¿1 that includes Arg85 [8,9], and other subsites located at the surface of the protein have also been considered. Although catalytic and substrate-binding subsite residues are conserved between RNase A and HP-RNase, the latter enzyme displays more basic residues on its surface and this fact has been related to additional catalytic activities. HP-RNase has greater catalytic versatility than RNase A: under physiological salt conditions it can cleave doublestranded RNA, poly(A) or the RNA component of RNA:DNA hybrid molecules [2,10]. According to a mechanism proposed by Sorrentino and Libonati [11], the degradation of dsRNA by HP-RNase is based on several positive charges displayed by the RNase molecule that interact with the polyanionic double helical substrate [12,13]. The preference for cleavage of phosphodiester bonds in the polymeric substrates has been studied for RNase A and human eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)/RNase 3 [14,15]. It has been shown that, whereas ECP shows a marked preference for exonucleolytic cleavage, RNase A has no special preference for endonucleolytic or exonucleolytic cleavage but shows a preference for the longer substrate molecules and for releasing fragments containing 6≠8 nucleotide units [14]. The differences between both enzymes have been related to the disappearance of p2 and B2 subsites in the ECP [15]. Kinetic studies of RNase A variants clearly indicate that the cleavage pattern depend on the subsite structure of the enzyme. The disappearance of p0 binding subsite (Lys66Gln≠RNase A) renders the enzyme more endonucleolytic, thus this subsite contributes to the exonucleolytic preference. On the contrary, the disappearance of p2 binding subsite (Lys7Gln/Arg10Gln≠RNase A) gives a more exonucleolytic pattern with poly(C), i.e., this subsite is directly involved in the endonucleolytic cleavage [16]. In the present work, we have studied the catalytic properties and the cleavage preference of HP-RNase using different substrates. We found that although all the residues belonging to the characterized subsites are conserved in HP-RNase, this enzyme shows a marked preference for an endonucleolytic cleavage with respect to RNase A.
Materials and methods Materials
RNase A, poly(C), C>p and HEPES were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Reversed-phase Nova-Pak C18 column (4 lm, 3.9 ¬ 150 mm)

HP-RNase variants
Construction and production of HP-RNase and its variant PM5 have been described elsewhere [17,18]. PM5 was obtained from wild-type HPRNase with the mutations Arg4Ala, Lys6Ala, Gln9Glu, Asp16Gly and Ser17Asn [17].

Digestion of poly(C)
Fifty microlitres of poly(C), 2.5 mg/ml, in 15 mM HEPES≠KOH (pH 7.5) was incubated at 25 ∞C with a final concentration of 30 nM RNase. At different time intervals, between 0 and 30 min, the reaction products were analyzed as previously described [14,16]. Briefly, the reversed-phase NovaPak C18 HPLC column was washed for 20 min with Milli-Q water and equilibrated for a further 20 min with solvent A (10% (w/v) ammonium acetate and 1% (v/v) acetonitrile in water). The reaction mixture was injected at 1 ml/min and elution was performed with an initial 10 min wash and a 50 min linear gradient from 100% solvent A to 10% solvent A plus 90% solvent B (10% (w/v) ammonium acetate and 11% (v/v) acetonitrile in water). After each run, the system was washed for 5 min with water containing 1% acetonitrile. Slight differences in the retention times of oligonucleotides could be produced depending on the equilibration time of the column. Eluted products were monitored following absorbance at 260 nm (Fig. 1) and were quantified by integrating the chromatographic peaks as described elsewhere [16]. The elution positions of the oligonucleotides were determined according to the method described in McFarland and Borer [19] and Moussaoui et al. [14].

Preparation of tetracytidylic acid [(Cp)3C>p] from poly(C) digestion
The tetracytidylic acid used as a substrate was obtained by RNase A digestion of a poly(C) solution. In a typical experiment, 500 ll of a 10 mg/ ml poly(C) solution in a 15 mM HEPES≠KOH (pH 7.5) were digested with 1 nM RNase A at 25 ∞C for 15 min. The reaction products were separated as described in the previous section. The fractions corresponding to the

Results and discussion Analysis of exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activities of HP-RNase We studied the cleavage preference of polymeric substrates by HP-RNase. First, we analyzed the pattern of products generated by the HP-RNase cleavage of poly(C) in a reversed-phase column at different incubation times. The poly(C) used as substrate is a high molecular mass polymer; however, it eluted as a single fraction from the column (data not shown), which indicates that oligonucleotides were not present in the sample in the initial conditions. Fig. 1 shows the elution profile obtained in a reversedphase HPLC of the cleavage products of poly(C) when only 50% of the substrate remained as a high molecular mass polymer. The analysis of the distribution of the oligonucleotides below 15 bases at different percentages of undigested poly(C) is shown in Fig. 2. The elution position of the oligonucleotides was deduced from the pattern obtained after a long incubation period (100 min), when there was no high molecular mass poly(C) left, and corresponded to the pattern previously described for RNase A cleavage [14,16]. Analysis of the chromatograms at different percentages of poly(C) digestion indicated that the enzyme does not act in a random fashion. Although at the beginning of the reaction polynucleotide fragments were mainly formed, a clear trend toward the formation of oligocytidylic acids with a size of about 8≠11 residues was observed at later stages of the reaction. These results suggest that the enzyme prefers binding and cleavage of long substrates and that to be preferentially cleaved by the enzyme, the phosphodiester bond has to be some 8≠11 nucleotides apart from at least one of the ends of the molecule. The cleavage pattern of RNase A, analyzed using the same procedure, showed that the bovine enzyme accumulates fragments containing 6≠8 nucleotides [14]. The difference in length of the accumulated intermediate oligonucleotides between the two proteins can be due to the presence of a greater number of positive charges, which can interact with the substrate, in HP-RNase than in RNase A. As expected, the chromatogram showed that the enzyme possesses endonucleolytic activity, but the appearance of mononucleotides also indicates that this enzyme possesses exonucleolytic activity (Figs. 1 and 2). Characterisation of the poly(C) breakdown is complicated by the complexity of the molecule and by the fact that most products of the reaction are also substrates of the enzyme, although with different specificities. It has been shown that the exo- and endonucleolytic activity of RNase A can be characterized by analyzing the products formed from the cleavage of tetracytidylic acid at different reaction times [16]. The tetranucleotide is the smallest substrate that can be used for this analysis. The cleavage of an external bond of the tetranucleotide (exonucleolytic cleavage) adjacent to either the 50 - or 30 -terminal nucleotide creates a tri-

Analysis of products from the cleavage of tetracytidylic acid by HPRNases
All assays were performed in 15 mM HEPES≠KOH (pH 7.5) at 25 ∞C, the substrate solution used had an absorbance at 260 nm close to 0.1, and the final enzyme concentration used was 40 nM. The enzyme concentration was selected so that a progress curve covering the depletion of at least 20% of the initial substrate could be obtained. The enzyme solution was made immediately before the assay to avoid denaturation. Tetracytidylic acid was incubated with either HP-RNase or PM5 and the product formation rate at different digestion times was analyzed by means of reversedphase HPLC. The column was washed for 20 min with Milli-Q water and equilibrated for 20 min with solvent A (10% (w/v) ammonium acetate and 0.3% (v/v) acetonitrile in water). Then, 50 ll of the reaction mixture was injected into the column and elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 mL/ min with an initial 10 min wash and a 40 min linear gradient from 100% solvent A to 10% solvent A plus 90% solvent B (10% (w/v) ammonium acetate and 5% (v/v) acetonitrile in water). Given the time taken for each assay ($30 min) and to avoid degradation owing to contamination effects associated with continuous freezing and thawing, aliquots of the substrate stock solution were kept frozen in Eppendorf tubes and only thawed immediately before use. Relative product formation was determined as described in [16] from the area per cent of each chromatographic peak divided by the corresponding extinction coefficient at 260 nm, using e260: 7845 M¿1 cm¿1 for C>p, 15175 M¿1 cm¿1 for CpC>p, 20745 M¿1 cm¿1 for (Cp)2C>p and 28683 M¿1 cm¿1 for (Cp)3C>p [16]. Exonucleolytic vs. endonucleolytic activity was obtained from the ratio of trinucleotide concentration to half of the dinucleotide concentration, i.e., (Cp)2C>p/ [(Cp)C>p/2]. The dinucleotide concentration has been divided by two because each endonucleolytically cleaved bond in the tetranucleotide yields two dinucleotide molecules, whereas each exonucleolytically broken bond only produces one trinucleotide molecule and one mononucleotide.

Determining the steady-state kinetic parameters
The kinetic parameters for the cleavage of poly(C) and the hydrolysis of C>p by wild type HP-RNase and PM5 were spectrophotometrically determined as described elsewhere [20]. All reactions were carried out in 0.2 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, at 25 ∞C. For C>p, the enzyme concentration was 0.1 lM and the concentration range of C>p was from 0.15 to 3 mM. The activity was measured by recording the increase in absorbance at 296 nm using 1-cm path length quartz cells. For assays with poly(C), the enzyme concentration was 5 nM, the concentration range of poly(C) was from 0.01 to 3 mg/ml, and the decrease in absorbance at 294 nm was monitored using 0.2-cm path length quartz cells. Steady-state kinetic parameters were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis using the program GraFit v.5 [21]. The values in Table 1 are the averages of two determinations, with a standard error of less than 10%.

For each oligonucleotide the peak area was divided by the number of residues to normalize the relation between the peak area and the quantity of oligonucleotide.

nucleotide plus a mononucleotide, whereas the cleavage of a central bond (i.e., endonucleolytic cleavage) gives rise to two dinucleotides (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows the chromatographic pattern for tetracytidylic acid digestion by

HP-RNase when approximately 50% of the substrate has been digested. From this chromatogram, it is apparent that there is an even accumulation of both the trinucleotide and dinucleotide, which does not indicate a priori a clear preference for the phosphodiester bond broken by HP-RNase. Visual inspection of the chromatogram by itself is non-conclusive as, for instance, two molecules of CpC>p are formed for each central broken bond instead of one, as is the case for (Cp)2C>p derived from breaking an external bond. In addition, the molar extinction coefficients of the species are different. These effects, together with the effect of different diffusions according to the retention time, clearly influence the actual height and broadness of the peaks. All these parameters have been taken into account to calculate the amount of each digestion product (see Materials and methods section). A rigorous quantification of the endonucleolytic to exonucleolytic cleavage preference must be determined from the product formation ratio at the beginning of the reaction when only the tetranucleotide is present (0% digested) [16]. This is because formation of the dinucleotide at later stages of the reaction could not be the result of endonucleolytic cleavage of the original tetranucleotide but the result of exonucleolytic cleavage from the intermediate trinucleotide product. The extrapolation to zero time of the ratios was performed graphically with the program GraFit v.5 [21]

(Fig. 4A). The exonucleolytic versus endonucleolytic activity of HP-RNase, as determined from the product ratios at zero time, was around 1.35 (Table 1). Although this result indicates that the enzyme shows no clear preference for any bond, the ratio is significantly lower than that obtained for RNase A (in which extrapolation to zero digestion time gives a value of 2.15). This preference change could be related to the specific function of both enzymes. Exonuclease activity would be more appropriate for a digestive role whereas endonuclease activity would be more suited to a regulation role. In the latter case, a solely internal cleavage of a given RNA may suppress either the correct coded protein translation or inactivate any regulatory miRNA or siRNA. Unlike RNase A, which basically displays a digestive function of exogenous RNA in the ruminant [22], the function of HP-RNase is not clear but it has been related to vascular homeostasis [23] and to inducing dendritic cell maturation [24]. Indeed, the high catalytic activity of HPRNase towards both dsRNA [13,25] and the RNA component of RNA:DNA hybrid molecules [10] seems to support the hypothesis that HP-RNase has been tailored for a regulation role. Substitution of basic residues located near p2 in HP-RNase changes its cleavage preference for tetracytidylic acid It has been previously described that the non-catalytic subsites p2 and p0 of RNase A influence its cleavage pattern on polymeric substrates [14]. Comparing the primary sequence of HP-RNase and RNase A shows that all the residues belonging to any characterized non-catalytic subsite in RNase A are conserved in the sequence of HPRNase. We have previously reported the structure of an HP-RNase variant named PM7 [26] in which five residues of the N-terminal region were substituted by the corre-

sponding residues of the bovine seminal RNase (BSRNase) and, in addition, a Pro to Ser mutation was introduced at position 50. The structure of PM7 was superposed to the structure of RNase A. Comparing the different subsite residues in the two structures revealed that the location of their Ca and orientation of their lateral chains were nearly coincident [26]. The fair displacement observed (the distance between Ca for each residue ranged from ∞ ∞ 0.21 A for Lys7 to 1.79 A for Lys66) could not account for the different patterns of tetranucleotide cleavage observed (Table 1). For RNase A, it has been reported that the deletion of basic residues in the N-terminal region in which p2 is located renders this enzyme more exonucleolytic [14,16]. Since HP-RNase has a higher number of basic residues at the N-terminus than RNase A (Fig. 5A), we asked whether these additional basic residues could increase the endonucleolytic activity of the human enzyme. For this, we characterised the cleavage pattern of PM5, a previously described variant of HP-RNase that lacks the basic residues Arg4 and Lys6, which have been substituted by Ala. It also incorporates the substitutions Gln9Glu, Asp16Gly and Ser17Asn (Fig. 5A) [17]. Analysis of the products obtained after the cleavage of the tetranucleotide by PM5 showed that this variant has completely different behaviour compared with HP-RNase (Table 1, Fig. 4B). PM5 shifts its preference for the cleavage of external bonds, and its ratio between exonucleolytic versus endonucleolytic activities is even higher than that of RNase A (Table 1). This change of preference is similar to that reported in an RNase A variant lacking the basic side chains of residues 7 and 10 proposed to belong to p2 [16]. That is, the ratio of broken external/internal bonds relative to the parental enzyme is 2.27 for PM5 and 2.29 for Lys7Gln/Arg10Gln-RNase A (Table 1).

The value was determined from the ratio of trinucleotide concentration versus one half of dinucleotide concentration at zero time. Exonucleolytic versus endonucleolytic activity of the different RNases at different percentages of tetranucleotide digestion is presented together with the linear correlation between the two parameters: HP-RNase (A) and PM5 (B). The extrapolation of the ratio to zero time was determined with the program GraFit v.5 [21] and indicates the preference of the enzymes on the intact substrate. The ratio decreases over time because the trinucleotide produced at the initial stages of the reaction is used later as a substrate by the enzyme producing more dinucleotide.

shown that the tetranucleotide phosphates can only bind in the enzyme at position p¿1p0p1p2 to produce an exonucleolytic cleavage or at position p0p1p2p3 to produce an endonucleolytic cleavage [16]. For HP-RNase, the introduced basic residues could constitute the anchorage point for an extra nucleotide (i.e., p3) or, alternatively, reinforce the binding of the substrate in p2. Various arguments support the two different hypotheses. On the one hand, if Arg4 constituted p3, its presence would contribute to binding to p0p1p2p3 but not to p¿1p0p1p2 and then a more endonucleolytic pattern would be expected. On the other, from a theoretical point of view, if Arg4 or, alternatively, Lys6 were reinforcing p2, an increase in the two binding possibilities would be expected and a more endo- or exonucleolytic pattern would depend on subtle differences in the binding energy at this subsite in the two positions. Nevertheless, when steady state kinetic parameters of PM5 and HPRNase were compared (Table 2), the data obtained seemed to indicate that the positive charges of Arg4 and Lys6 in HP-RNase do not constitute a phosphate-binding subsite. As can be seen in Table 2, kcat values for C>p and poly(C) and the Km for C>p are not modified, whereas the Km for poly(C) is slightly higher than in the native enzyme. These differences are very small when compared with the effects of

Recently, the 3D-structure of HP-RNase complexed with the human ribonuclease inhibitor has been reported [27]. This is the only known structure of HP-RNase that contains the N-terminal sequence of the wild-type enzyme, and its main-chain structure is very similar to that of the ∞ monomeric variant (PM7) (RMS of 0.86 A) described by our group [26]. This structure allows the basic residues of the N-terminus to be mapped (Fig. 5B). Given the polyanionic nature of the RNase substrate, it is likely that the residues of HP-RNase responsible for this change of preference are Arg4 or Lys6; especially the former because it is the only changed residue whose side chain faces the catalytic site cleft of the enzyme. For RNase A, it has been

Km for poly(C) was calculated using the lowest Mr value as the basis for the calculation.

deleting a phosphate binding subsite in RNase A. Deletion of p¿1, p0 or p2 increases the Km for poly(C) of the resulting variants by 16, 2.5 and 3.5 times respectively [7,9]. Finally, PM5 shows a digestion pattern of poly(C) similar to that of HP-RNase (Figs. 1 and 6), including the accumulation of oligonucleotides of 8≠11 nucleotides. Many of the RNase A genes of ruminants or of mammals with ruminant-like digestion do not code for a basic residue at position 4 [28≠30]. Furthermore, although a basic residue at position 4 is found in nearly all RNase A sequences of primates [31], there is a significant exception in the case of Douc langur colobine monkeys, which mainly eat leaves that are subsequently fermented by symbiotic bacteria in the foregut. These monkeys have a RNase A gene duplication resulting in the RNase 1B protein [31]. RNase 1B has evolved to digest bacterial RNA and again the Arg at position 4 is absent. We have shown that HP-RNase displays a more endonucleolytic preference than its bovine homologue, which correlates with a non-digestive role for this enzyme. We have also shown that this preference can be reverted by removing basic residues located at the N-terminal region of the enzyme.
