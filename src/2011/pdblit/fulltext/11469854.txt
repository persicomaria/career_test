The crystal structure of a chimeric Fab' fragment of a monoclonal antibody is presented. The Fab' comprises the murine light chain and heavy chain variable domains of the carcinoma-binding antibody B72.3 fused to the constant domain of human K, and the first constant domain and hinge domain of human ~4, respectively. A model for the Fab' has been determined by molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of 3.1 a with an R-factor of 17.6%. The additional residues that distinguish a Fab' from a Fab fragment are seen to be disordered in the crystals. The H3 hypervariable loop is short and adopts a sharp hairpin turn in a conformation that results from an interaction between the lysine side-chain of H93 and the main-chain carbonyl group of H96. The remaining hypervariable loops display conformations similar to those predicted from the canonical structures approach, although loop H2 is apparently displaced by a salt-bridge formed between H55 Asp and the neighbouring H73 Lys. These and other features of the structure likely to be important in grafting the hypervariable loops to an otherwise human framework are discussed.

IL. Introduction
Protein engineering offers the potential to extend the medical, diagnostic and therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies. While the production of murine monoclonal ant'ibodies is now straightforward, producing human antibodies remains difficult. Murine antibodies are, however, antigenic in humans and hence give rise t.o non-specific responses and faster clearance rates (for a review see Winter and Nilstein, 1991). Protein engineering offers the potential to "humanize" murine monoclonals and hence overcome these problems. This requires the of the intact murine antigensuccessful transfer binding site to a human framework. While considerable progress toward this endeavour can be made with our present understanding of antibody structure, success is more likely if the intimate structure of the target antigen-binding site is'known.

paper we present the crystal structure of a chimeric human/mouse Fab' fragment. The structure of the antigen-binding site forms the basis for interpreting the results of experiments aimed at reconstructing the antigen-binding site on an otherwise human framework. B72.3 is a murine monoclonal antibody with specificity for a large tumour-associated mucin-like glycoprotein, TAG72. B72.3 has already been used in severa, clinical studies and shows considerable potential for the detection and fut)ure therapy of colorectal, breast and lung carcinoma (Thor et al., 1986; Sheer et al., 1988). Binding studies (Kjeldsen et al., 1988; Hanisch et al., 1989) suggest that the epitope on TAG72 consists of both O-linked carbohydrate and at least one amino acid residue in the adjacent protein surface. A chimeric form of the Fab' fragment of B72.3 has been constructed and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (King et al., 1992). This Fab' fragment contains the murine light chain and heavy chain variable domains of 253

overcome. A second, higher-resolution data set (3.1 A data) was later collected using a similar strategy, again from a single crystal. Owing to the geometry of data collection both these sets lacked a region of data around the rotation axis. Data were processed using the package WEIS (Higashi, 1989) adapted at York to be run on a Silicon Graphics computer. Processing was greatly assisted by an image plate display program IPD written for a Silicon Graphics Iris by IV. Hartshorn at York (available to academic users). Data were scaled and combined using the CCP4 programs ROTAVATA and ACROVATA. Data with an Fobs of less than 1 CJ were rejected at this stage. These data are summarized in Table I. It should be noted that the 2 data sets differ not only in resolution but also in that the 3.1 A& data are significantly more complete than the 3.5 L%data. The data sets were not merged, however, as the initial data set had been collected from a slightly imperfect/twinned crystal.

B72.3 fused to the constant domain of human K, and the first constant domain and hinge domain of human 74, respectively. Crystallization of this Fab' fragment has been reported (Brady et al., 1991). The molecular structure of these crystals is now presented. Humanized forms of this Fab' in which most of the framework residues have been replaced with a human sequence have now been prepared (Emtage et al., unpublished results).

2. Experimental
Crystals of B72.3 Fab' were grown by dialysis using ammonium sulphate and 5 0/o 1,4-dioxan as precipitant, as described by Brady et al. (1991). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P2,2,2, with a = 67.5 A, b = 93.2 a and c = 208.8 a (1 a = 0.1 nm). Diffraction is weak but has been observed to dmin = 2% A using synchrotron radiation, although resolution decays rapidly upon irradiation. Because of the acute radiation sensitivity of the crystals, diffraction data were collected using the Weissenberg camera on the Photon Factory synchrotron in Japan (Sakabe, 1983). This allowed a relatively complete native data set to be collected from a single crystal, although the resolution of these data was restricted; due to crystal deterioration after the first few minutes of irradiation. An initial medium resolution data set (3.5 a data) was collected from a single crystal rotated 90" around the c* axis, commencing with the CL* axis perpendicular to the beam. The complete data set required 12 image plates, on each of which 7" to 8" of data were recorded, the translation of the camera being 3 or 4 mm/degree of oscillation. Plates were scanned on a BA-100 scanner (Fuji) at 100 pm. Later inspection of the images showed the crystal to be very slightly twinned; however, careful processing allowed this problem to be

of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank revealed that the Fab portion of the HyHeE-5 structure (Sheriff et al., 1987) possessed the greatest sequence similarity with B72.3 (66% overall: St>"/0 V,, 63% V,, 75% C$, 660,: f&l). Two search models were constructed from the HyHel-5 (ZWFL) Fab structure. Model 1 comprised the Hy el-5 sequence and coordinates, from which residu thought likely to be in differing conformations were removed. These within the hypervariable were residues loops (L29-31, LX-52, L91&94 and H30-33, H55-56, the elbow region (LlW-109 and H96-lOI), I 14-I 15) and residues from an insert in (:,I, which comprise an extended loop on the variable domain/constant domain interface (HI 82-183). All residue numbers refer to the numbering scheme of Kabat, el al. (1987). Model 2 was based on tbe co-ordinates of model 1, except that the R72.3 sequence had been insert'ed in place of that of HyHel-5. In places where the sequences differed the side-chain conformations of

Both models contained 197 light chain (L) and 196 heavy chain (H) residues, the coordinates of which were transformed to a PH cell. A self-rotation using both data sets (ALMN program, CCP4 suite) gave a variety of peaks, none immediately interpretable. A native Patterson. however, revealed the presence of a large (approximately 25 y. of origin intensity) peak at (0, l/2, t 18); which suggested that the expected two molecules in the asymmetric unit were in the same orientation and separated by a translation of half the unit cell

Th e package XPLOR (version 2.1; Brunger 199Oa, using E values as coefficients) was used to perform cross-rotation searches using model I with the 3.5 A data and then with the 3.1 A data. and then model 2 with both data sets. Data from 8.0 A to 3.1 A were included. The highest 200 peaks of each search were subjected to the Patterson coefficient (PC) refinement procedure described by Brunger (19906). The V,, Vn, C, and Cn domains were treated as independent within the PC refinement rigid-body refinement procedure. After PC refinement model 1 with the 3.5 A data produced a clear single maximum peak (solution (1)) (correlation coefficient on PC refinement (rrc) giving a peak height = 0.073, next peak height @058), corresponding to a rot)ation of the model by the Eulerian angles: 4 = 43.65". $ = 11.74" and IC = 149.11". angles and rpc are as defined by Brunger was consistent with the two molecules in the asymmetric unit being in the same orientation. The elbow angle in this rigid-bodv retined orientation was increased by about 4' relative to HyHel-5. A very similar maximum was obtained when model 2 w-as rotated against the same (3.5 A) data, and also when mode1 1 was rotated against t,hr 3.1 A data. However, the combination of model 2 with the 3.1 A data produced a single maximum (solution (2)) (peak height 0.106, next peak height 0.060) at: Eulerian

The models were then rotated by the angles corresponding to each of these solutions, and t,hen submitted to the translation function search within XPLOR' using data 15.0 to 3.1 A. The non-cryst'allographic symmetry (NC'S) evident in the native Patterson required two solutions related by the translational vector (0 0.5 #125). Only solution (2) gave two peaks (relative heights peak 1 = 100-00, peak 2 = 90.83, next peak = 6580) related by this vector: (@I52 0315 0355) and (0.152 0804 0.485) (Solution A). A traditional R-fa,ctor translation search performed using the CCP4 program TFSGEN did, however, produce possible solutions for both rotation solutions. For solution 2 these were again the two most' int'ense peaks (relative heights 100 and 95.1, next highest peak 659), and corresponded to the translation vectors: ((h143 0.312 0.355) and (0.143 0.805 0485), which are essentially the same as solution (A). The peaks from the solution (I)-oriented model, however. were lower in relative peak heights (66 and

Solut,ion B was refined against the 3.5 A data using simulated annealing (SA) in XPLOR. The standard crystallographic R-factor (as calculated in XPLOR on data greater than 2 g in the resolution range 15 A to 3.5 A) dropped from an initial value of 0.524 to 0.225 with root-mean-square (r.m.s.t) deviations from ideality of bond lengths (r.m.s. bonds) = 0.047 A and deviations of angles (r.m.s. angles) = 7.23", but no non-crystallographic constraints were applied and the Inappropriate weights in the refinement resulted in poor protein However, when refined against the stereochemistry. 3.1 A data and with strict NCS contraint,s applied, the R-factor rose to 0.315 with r.m.s. bonds = 0.048 A and r.m.s. angles = 7.49". This solution was therefore believed to be incorrect. A two-molecule model corresponding to model 2 positioned by solution A was subjected to rigidbody refinement using XPLOR. This gave an R-factor of 0.408 (15A to 3.1 A), with r.m.s. bonds = 0.067 ,A and r.m.s. angles = 5.76". The poor stereochemistry of the model at t)his stage is the result of building in the B72.3 sequence on the HyHel-5 backbone, as described above. Strict noncrystallographic restraints to keep the two molecules identical, together with energy minimization and SA refinement' were used to produce new model with R-factor = 0212 (15 A to 3.1 A), r.m.s. bonds = 0.030 A and r.m.s. angles = 5.1". At this stage 2Fobs-Fcalc maps were calculated and the map for one molecule "skewed" to that, for the other using the SKEVV program (C(`P4). Manual under FRODO (Jones, 1978) and inserrebuilding tion of the loop regions. which at this stage were clearly evident in the maps, gave a new model with initia,l R-factor of 0266. r.m.s. bonds = 0.039 A and r.m.s. angles, 5.0". which after strict NCS constraints minimization and SA rrfinemrnt~ gave an R-factor of 0,188 (15 to 3.1 A). r.m.s. bonds = 0.019 A and r.m.s. angles = 4.1". A further manual rebuild and insertion of all residues followed by SA refinement (still with strict NCS restraints) gave a final mode1 with R-factor = 0.176 (15 A to 3.1 A). r.m.s. bonds = 0.017 A and r.m.s. angles = 3.7 ". The average H-factor in the firm1 model is 33.75 A2 for main-chain and 4066 A2 for side-chain atoms. Given the limited resolution of the available data (3.1 A) and apparent identity of the two molecules to this resolution (as judged by the intensity of the peak in the native Patterson and ability to refine a model readily with two identical molecules), strict, NCS was maintained at all stages of the refinement. The final model consists of one Fab' molecule comprising 3234 non-hydrogen atoms, refined subject to strict NCS. No water molecules or bulk solvent correction ha,ve been t Abbreviations

Details of the refinement are given in Table 2. The root-mean-square deviation between main-chain atoms in the final model from those present in the orginal search model is 1.1 A.

4. Results and Discussion
(a) Molecular replacement Brunger et al. (1991) have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of the PC refinement procedure in XPLOR in orienting multi-domain search models such as Fab fragments. The rigid-body refinement procedure after a conventional crosssearch is capable of automatically rotation adjusting the elbow angle in a Fab prior to a translational search. It has been suggested that the improved orientation increases the sensitivity of the

translation search (Brunger, 1990b). The radius of convergence of the rigid-body refinement procedure has been estimated at 13" (Brunger et al.. 1991). We note that this convergence appears to be both dataand model-sensitive. In the case of B72.3, a lower resolution and less complete data set failed to adjust correctly the elbow angle of the search model. However, even when an improved data set, was used, the original search model did not give the correct orientation without manual adjustment of the elbow angle. By "optimizing" our search model (in this case by correction of the sequence and energy minimization of replaced side-chain conformations) we were able to obtain the correct orientation even though this required the rigid body refinement procedure to adjust the elbow angle by 18". This occurred only when both the most complete data set and optimized model were used. Hence, in this case at least the radius of convergence of the PC refinement procedure appears to

extend well beyond the 13" limit previously proposed, provided that an appropriate search model is used. Our experience in being able to refine the incorrect solution (B) to a reasonably low R-factor demonstrates the caution that must be applied when using powerful refinement techniques such as simulated annealing with data of limited resolution. In this case the incorrect solution was easily identified because agreement could only be achieved at the expense of good protein stereochemistry and non-crystallographic symmetry. Other symptoms included the decreased agreement when the model was refined against the higher resolution and more complete data, and breaks in main-chain continuity in density maps. The fact that the solution could be refined at all may in part be due to the similarity of two of the components of the translation vector to their corresponding components of the correct solution. This solution was in any case considered less likely from the outset as both the rotation and translation maxima were of lower intensity than those for solution A, although initial packing analyses of both solutions revealed acceptable intermolecular interactions.

section of the electron density is 1. Considering the limited resolu-

tion of the data the quality of the map is, in general, quite high. This may be due in part to the improvement in phasing imposed by maintaining strict noncrystallographic symmetry. A Ramachandran plot for all residues is shown in Figure 2. Two residues fall outside the allowed regions described in the plot, which is not unexpected, given the limited resolution of the data. These residues are identified on the plot. The electron density at 3.1 A resolution gives insufficient detail to place the main-chain carbonyl groups for these residues with certainty. One of the outliers is in the L2 hypervariable loop (I, : 52) and was not included in the original model, the other (H: 205), although in a loop region within the constant domain, was in the original search model. The structure shows the typical Fab immunoglobulin fold, and backbone atoms can be readily superposed on other Fab structures (Table 3). The r.m.s. differences between B72.3 and other Fab domains are within the range of comparison of other Fab structures reported. Figure 3 compares the C" trace for B72.3 with that of HyHel-5. A significant change in elbow angle (18") is evident. The calculated elbow angle for B72.3 is 137", which is within the range observed in Fab structures. The crystal packing results in a differing arrangement of molecular contacts for the two copies of the molecule. Of the hypervariable loops, two of the loops (Ll and L2) make no crystal contacts in either copy of the molecule. In L3, weak contacts are made when 1~92 Trp stacks against L92 Trp (3.5 A)

In one copy 1~94 Thr also makes a weak hydrogen bond (3.5 -4) to H56 Asp (HZ loop) on the symmetry-related molecule. One interaction that is common to both molecules is between 55H (NDZ) and 31H'(OD2), 3.5 A, HZ loop to HI loop on adjacent molecule. The effect of these weak interactions appears to be minimal, as it has proven possible to refine the two copies identically without generating bad contacts, despite the different packing of each molecule. In two places away from the hypervariable loops there have been rearrangements of external loops, relative to the structure for HyHel-5. to facilitate crystal packing. Concerted movement is observed in adjacent external loops comprising residues 1,180 to L185 and L120 to L130. Rearrangement of external loops is also

observed in the H-chain. Residues H187 to HI93 abut the residues I,13 to I,20 in a symmetry-related molecule. To accommodate this, the loop moves away. towards the neighbouring residues H130 to H136, causing this adjacent loop also to shift its relative position. Very weak density is seen for some of the additional residues at the C-terminal end of the H-chain t*hat distinguish a Fab' from a Fab fragment. These residues are presumably poorly ordered in the crystals. This is supported by the observation that Fab fragments prepared by papain digestion of an intact IgG sample of the chimeric antibody crystallize completely isomorphously. The additional ten residues are expected to occupy a region of low density in the crystals adjacent t'o the C-terminal end of the H-chain. (c) Hypervariable loop predictions

A predict'ed model for the structure of 1372.3 Fab' has been constructed (D. J. Edwards & R. E. Hubbard, unpublished results). The hypervariable loop conformations in this model were based on the canonical structures method of Chothia et al. (1989). Alignment of the CDR sequences for B72.3 and HyHel-5 is given in Table 4. On the basis of

sequence similarity the Ll loop was assigned to canonical structure 2, L2 to the only canonical structure for this loop, and L3 to canonical structure 1 (all as described by Chothia et al.. 1989). For the heavy chain loops, Hl was assigned to canonical structure 1, and H2 to canonical structure 2. Tt should be noted that the H2 assignment is largely dictated by the presence of an alanine at position H71. Similarly, the Hl assignment is det'ermined by the presence of arginine at H94 and isoleucine at H34, as is observed in HyHel-5. A caonformation for the H3 loop, for which there are no recognized canonical structures, was predicted on the basis of partial similarity with HyHel-5 and then regularized using CHARMM. The H3 loop, for which there are no recognized canonical structures, is short in B72.3. comprising only five residues, which adopt' a sharp hairpin turn at the end of strands F and G (Fig. 4). The variable region sequences for a number of ot,her antibodies known to bind to epitopes in TAG72, and which compete with B72.3 for binding to the antigen, have by molecular cloning (Schlom & been obtained Colcher, 1987; Mezes et aZ., 1990). These antibodies derive from a common V, germline and the VD,J rearrangements have resulted in similar. short H3 sequences. In chimeric B72.3 this loop lies at the base of the basket formed by the CI)R loops, and as such is likely to be of special importance in ant'igen binding. The a,rginine at position H94. which is seen in other structures to salt-bridge with a frequently observed aspartic acid at HI01 (but absent in the short H3 loop of B72.3), in this case is observed to make a weak hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl of H97. However, the density ohserved for this H94 side-chain conformation is weak in the unliganded map. One possible interpr&ation is that the arginine side-chain changes conformation and reacts directly with the antigen upon binding. H93, usually an alanine packing at the H/L interface, is a lysine in N72.3, and makes a charged hydrogen bond with the H3 loop main chain, in this case with the carbonyl group of H96. Unlike H93, thr density for the lysine side-chain is well-defined (the avrrage B-factor for the side-chain is 21.52 A2. cf. an average of 40.06 w2 for the whole molecbule), and it appears that this interaction is the chief cause of the unusual conformation observed for this loop. The effect is that t'he loop lies flat across the base of t,he antigen binding site, rather than protruding into the site. A result of the loop conformation is that the aromatic groups at H96 and H97 lie across the floor of the binding site, t'heir conformation being dependent upon packing alongside I,91 Phe and L96 Tyr. The hydroxyl groups of tyrosines HlOO and L96 are hydrogen-bonded, an interaction between the H3 and L3 loops. Although making no contacts, H97 Tyr packs into a slot between the side-chains of L32 and 1~50: both hypervariable loop residues. While the H3 loop distortion appears to originate from the H93 Lys- >H97 main-chain carbon)-1 interaction, the loop side-chain conformations depend largely on the packing of aromatic residues 1,91, L96.

Putative hydrogen bonds are shown as broken lines. The hydrogen bond between the side-chain of H93 Lys and the main-chain carbonyl group of H96 appears to restrict the H3 loop to lie across the floor of the Epitope combining site. In Bi'2.3 the CDR3 segment of the heavy chain is short. comprising just 5 residues: H95 Ser, H96 Tyr, H97 Tyr, HI00 Gly and HlOl His.

H97 and their position with regard to the other loops. As such, a canonical approach hypervariable to H3 loop predictions may prove difficult. It is possible that H93 Lys may also react directly with the antigen on binding. Given the apparently crucial role of this residue in maintaining the loop conformation observed in the unliganded structure, a likely consequence of this would be restructuring of the H3 loop on antigen binding. (d) Structure
in relation to humanization experiments

Although the chimeric form of B72.3 is less antigenie than the murine form, clinical studies suggest that an immune response to the variable region still occurs (Khazaeli et al., 1991). Further humanization in which the CDRs are transferred to a human framework has been attempted for other antibodies 1986; Riechmann et al, 1988; (Jones et al., Verhoeyen et al., 1988, 1991; Queen et al., 1989; Co et al., 1991; Daugherty et al., 1991; Gorman et al, 1991; et al., 1991; Maeda et aE., 1991: Kettleborough Tempest et al., 1991). These experiments have relied on model building or inspection of sequences to identify residues outside the CDRs that may contribute to affinity. The crystal structure of the chimeric B72.3 Fab provides a basis from which non-CDR residues that are likely to influence CDR conformations may be determined. These include residues interacting directly with the CDR regions, either solvent-accessible or internal, and residues that have an effect on the general integrity of the variable region domains. As the present structure is limited to 3.1 A in resolution, many of the interatomic interactions that the final model suggests must be interpreted with caution. However, for the purposes of humanization experiments, it is largely the relative positions of residues with respect to their neighbours that is of importance. Several examples of residues interacting with the CDRs have been identified in the crystal structure. In predicting the conformation of the H2 loop of Chothia et al. (1989) emphasised the significance residue H71, which is often seen to interact with adjacent side-chains in the H2 loop. This residue is

frequently alanine, a small side-chain that creates a cavity into which a conserved proline at H52a is proposed to pack, hence influencing the H2 loop conformation (Chothia et al., 1989). In B72.3 this residue is alanine, and the other residues lining this cavity (H52a Pro, H.51 Ile and H29 Phe) are all conserved between B72.3 and HyHel-5. A comparison of these two structures (Fig. 5(a)) and analysis of distances of the surrounding residue side-chains from the CB of the alanine shows that, despite the the proline side-chain in sequence conservation, B72.3 is less closely packed relative to HyHel-5 by an average of 0.5 A. This change seems to be in part by closer packing of H51 isocompensated leucine (average 1 A closer). Although these are small changes relative to the resolution of our model (3 A), they are average values for all of the atoms of these residues and represent shifts of residues rather than precise interatomic movements. One explanation for this alteration in packing may be an interact'ion that is observed further along this strand at H73 where the lysine side-chain is seen to saltbridge with the aspartic acid side-chain at H55 in the H2 loop (Fig. 5(b)). In the crystal structure the salt-bridge does not appear to be strong; density is observed for about 50% occupancy in the bridge with the alternative conformation protruding into solvent. However, the distortion produced can be seen in a comparison of distances between equivalent C" atoms, between B72.3 and HyHel-5. when aligned by least squares on all variable domain strands: (~1" H52 H52a H.53 H54 H55 H56 H57 H58 Distance H72.3>>HyHel-5 nearest 0.5 A) 1.0 I.0 2.5 3.0 2.6 2.0 16 I.0 (to

I>espite the sequence conservation between the 2 proteins in this region, the packing of residues H29 Phe, H51 Ile and H52a Pro has been rearranged, possibly as a result of a salt-bridge formed in B72.3 between H73 Lys and H.55 Asp, an interaction
absent in HyHel-5. Residue labels are for the B72.3 structure. (b) Comparison of B72.3 (heavy lines) and HyHel-5 (light lines): illustrating the salt-bridge in B72.3 between H73 Lys and H55 Asp and the corresponding movement of the loop, which includes H55 Asp together with residues H51 Ile and H52a Pro. Residue labels are for the R72.3 structure.

B72.3 heavy variable region differs from the germline gene at only two positions: at H37 where B72.3 has an alanine compared to the valine in the germline sequence; and at H55 where B72.3 has an aspartate instead of the germline glycine. The H55 Gly- >Asp somatic mutation has occurred in three other anti-TAG72 antibodies, CC49, CC83 and CC92 (Mezes et al., 1990) all of which have a lysine at H73. CDR grafting experiments using B72.3 in which the residue at H73 is derived from the human acceptor sequence produce an antibody with a reduction in orders of magnitude. of nearly two affinity Substitution of the lysine residue at H73 substantially restores t,he binding activity of the humanized antibody (unpublished results). Other regions likely to interact directly with the CDR regions are the N termini of the two chains. The L-chain N terminus is close to the Ll loop, and main-chain hydrogen bonds are observed to L24

and L26. A charged hydrogen bond is also present between the side-chains of L5 Thr and L24 Arg. This arginine is absent in HyHel-5, but inst*ead the side-chain of L26 Ser hydrogen bonds to the main chain at L2. These interactions may influence the Ll loop conformation. At the H-chain N terminus hydrogen bonds are made to the main chain at H23 to H25, the region at the base of the Hl loop. The imidazole group of H99 His (loop H3) forms hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl of H2 Val and to the side-chain of 1~45 Gln. A water-mediated interaction is also observed between the H3 Gln side-chain and that of L45 Gln. The conformation of residues Hl and H2 differs significantly from that of HyHel-5, despite conservation of sequence. In B72.3 the H3 loop folds away allowing the N terminus to sit between the Hl and H3 loops. In HyHel-5, on the other hand, the conformation of the H3 loop restricts this conformation and instead

the N-terminal two residues pack against the HI loop. For grafting experiments, however, it is likely that the packing of residues 2 and 4 on both chains is crucial. The side-chains of these residues pack closely against and under loops HI, H3 and L3. Tn B72.3 and probably in other antibodies the nature of these side-chains should be conserved during the humanization process. It is worth noting that certain processes for cloning antibody variableuse redundant oligonucleotide region sequences primers, which hybridize t,o the sequences of the antibody mRNAs in these framework regions (Orlandi et al., 1989; Gavilondo-Cowley et al.. 1990). Tn such experiments the DNA sequence generated in resultant DNA clones may not, be the same as that found in the mRNA and may lead to differences in the resultant amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of the variable domains. This may lead to a difference in the affinity of antibody expressed from the cloned antibody genes compared to t'he orginal hybridoma. Other internal residues that make contacts with CDR residues may also have an effect on binding. In many cases these residues are conserved or similar between murine and human antibodies. However, it is known t'hat small changes in the side-chain volume and polarity of packing residues in the core of a protein domain can have measurable effects on the stability of the protein (Sandberg & Terwilliger. 1989, 1991a.b). Such effects, in the case of antibody domains. could translate into measurable difference in binding affinity. In the chimeric B72.3 Fab' structure many of these packing residues can be identified at the base or stem of hypervariable loops. The influence of H93 Lys on the H3 loop conformation has already been discussed. L36 Tyr, at the C-terminal end of the L2 loop, forms a hydrogen bond with L89 Gin (part of the L3 loop). Given also the proximity of this residue to the H/L interface, its conservation in grafting experiments could be important. At residue L48, which in H72.3 is a valinr the L2 loop, any substitution that packs underneath would need be conservative (i.e. the residue should be small and hydrophobic). In the crystal structure there is some room for substitut,ion here and indeed grafting experiments demonstrate that isoleucine can be successfully inserted. L48 packs closely against L64 Gly, so that there is little or no room for a side-chain at t,hat position (indeed, the Gly is conserved). L71 Tyr is an important, residue previously noted by others (Chothia rt al., 1989). In the structure of B72.3 the hydroxyl group of this tyrosine hydrogen bonds t'o the amido nitrogen of L31 main-chain (I,1 loop). Additional hydrogen bonds are also formed from the main-chain carbonyl of 1~68 Gly to the side-chain amide of L28 Asn (Ll loop) as well as the main-chain amido nitrogen of L68 Gly and the main-chain carbonyl of L29 Ile (Ll loop). The detail in the interpretation derived from this model is, however, constrained by t,he resolution of the diffraction data available. On the H-chain at the base of the HI loop H37 .41a is at the H/L interface, and again the structure

suggests a requirement for a small hydrophobic, at this position. A valine has been side-chain used at this site in grafting experisuccessfully residues ments. We note a cluster of hydrophobic the CUR regions of the closely packed beneath comprising H48 Ile, H63 Phe. H67 Ala. H-chain H69 Leu, H78 Ala and H80 Met. The cryst,al structure would suggest caution in replacing any of these in grafted forms. Padlan (1991) has residues recent13 suggested that humanization may br complet'ed if sequences in the (`ore of successfully murme antibody variable regions art' the maintained. In summary. the crystal st,ructure of the chimeric B72.3 Fab' is the first structure reported for both a chimeric Fab' fragment and for an anti-tumour antibody. The structure provides a basis on which to map epitopes identified in t,he immune response to the chimeric antibody (Begent it al.. of patients 1990; Khazaeli d aZ., 1991: Raker ef al.. 1992). Because of the obvious applications for this type of antibody t'he structure also provides a basis from which humanization experiments ma\- be optimized. We are currently attempting to obtiin crystals of a humanized version of B72.3 Fa,b'. The c*o-ordinates have been deposited with thr Brookhaven Data Bank and are available dirrlctly from
the aut,hors on request' until released. they have been prowssed and
