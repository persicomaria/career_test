Abstract: The design and synthesis of transition-state mimics reflects the growing need both to understand enzymatic catalysis and to influence strategies for therapeutic intervention. Iminosugars are among the most potent inhibitors of glycosidases. Here, the binding of 1-deoxynojirimycin and (+)-isofagomine to the "family GH-1" -glucosidase of Thermotoga maritima is investigated by kinetic analysis, isothermal titration calorimetry, and X-ray crystallography. The binding of both of these iminosugar inhibitors is driven by a large and favorable enthalpy. The greater inhibitory power of isofagomine, relative to 1-deoxynojirimycin, however, resides in its significantly more favorable entropy; indeed the differing thermodynamic signatures of these inhibitors are further highlighted by the markedly different heat capacity values for binding. The pH dependence of catalysis and of inhibition suggests that the inhibitory species are protonated inhibitors bound to enzymes whose acid/base and nucleophile are ionized, while calorimetry indicates that one proton is released from the enzyme upon binding at the pH optimum of catalysis (pH 5.8). Given that these results contradict earlier proposals that the binding of racemic isofagomine to sweet almond -glucosidase was entropically driven (Bulow, A. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 8567-8568), we reinvestigated the ¨ binding of 1-deoxynojirimycin and isofagomine to the sweet almond enzyme. Calorimetry confirms that the binding of isofagomine to sweet almond -glucosidases is, as observed for the T. maritima enzyme, driven by a large favorable enthalpy. The crystallographic structures of the native T. maritima -glucosidase, and its complexes with isofagomine and 1-deoxynojirimycin, all at 2.1 Å resolution, reveal that additional ordering of bound solvent may present an entropic penalty to 1-deoxynojirimycin binding that does not penalize isofagomine.

Transition-state analogue design1 is a rapidly expanding genre in the glycosidase field.2,8,26 It is not merely inspired by the design of potential therapeutics, but also by a need to understand transition-state stabilization by this remarkable class of enzyme, which is estimated to accelerate glycosidic bond hydrolysis by a factor of 1017.3-5 The transition states for enzymatic glycosidase hydrolysis feature considerable oxocarbenium-ion character

in which the anomeric carbon acquires sp2 hybridization and partial positive charge develops at the anomeric carbon and the endocyclic oxygen (Scheme 1).6 The exact charge distribution and the conformation of the transition state will vary from enzyme to enzyme, in some cases considerably.7,33 Iminosugars such as 1-deoxynojirimycin (1) and isofagomine (2) are of particular interest in inhibitor design (Scheme 1). These are often powerful inhibitors of glycosidase action, and it has been proposed that their conjugate acids mirror positive charge development at the endocyclic oxygen or the anomeric carbon of the glycosidase transition state, respectively.8 While superficially this is a persuasive and intuitive proposal, there is no correlation between Ki and kcat/KM for 1 and family 1 -glucosidases.9,10 Likewise, recent van't Hoff analyses of the

temperature dependence of binding of 1 and racemic 2 to sweet almond -glucosidase (also a family 1 enzyme11) suggest that while the affinity of 1 was enthalpically driven (H ) -6.14 kcal mol-1, TS ) +0.092 kcal/mol), the affinity of 2 was favored only by entropic forces offset by a greatly unfavorable enthalpy (H ) +14 kcal/mol, TS ) +23.1 kcal/mol).12 Given that 1 and 2 most likely make many similar interactions with the enzyme, the large unfavorable enthalpy proposed for 2 is certainly unexpected. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters for 2 are at odds with a criterion for transition-state analogues proposed by Wolfenden,4,5 which suggests that the affinity of an enzyme for a transition-state mimic should necessarily be driven by a large and favorable change in enthalpy, as is the case for the corresponding affinity for the reaction transition state. These observations question the degree, if any, of transitionstate mimicry displayed by simple iminosugars and have led us to reexamine the binding of 1 and 2 to family 1 -glucosidases on the basis of thermodynamics, pH dependence, and three-dimensional structures. Given the known heterogeneity of sweet almond -glucosidase preparations,11,13 a -glucosidase from Thermotoga maritima (hereafter TmGH1) was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), a technique that directly measures enthalpies of association, reveals that, in contrast to previous suggestions,12 the binding of 1 and optically pure (+)-2 is driven by large favorable enthalpies both with the TmGH1 and with the sweet almond enzyme. While 1 and 2 both display similar and favorable enthalpies of binding, the large difference in affinity of the two compounds is indeed governed by the more favorable entropy of 2. The three-dimensional structure of TmGH1, determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.1 Å resolution in native form, and in complexes with 1, 2, as well as a 2-deoxy2-fluoro-D-glucosyl intermediate, illuminates the different binding properties of these inhibitors, particularly the role of solvation, the 2-hydroxyl, and the acid/base catalyst.

measurements of proton release, suggest that the inhibitory species for 2 is that with protonated inhibitor and a largely inactive enzyme species whose acid/base and nucleophile are both deprotonated. We suggest that the superior inhibition of 2 relative to 1 is not the result of superior transition-state mimicry but is due to an entropic advantage and a more favorable electrostatic interaction with the acid/base catalyst.
Results and Discussion

Cloning, Overexpression, and Kinetic Characterization of TmGH1. Previous intriguing results with almond -glucosidase led us to investigate the binding of 1 and 214 to -glucosidases by calorimetry and X-ray crystallography. The sweet almond enzyme, a family 1 glycosidase, is, however, both heterogeneous and predominantly (>50%) inactive.15 The T. maritima family GH-1 -glucosidase (TmGH1) gene was therefore obtained by PCR on T. maritima genomic DNA and overexpressed in E. coli. Preliminary studies revealed that, as expected, TmGH1 is highly thermostable, retaining full activity after 4 h and 75% activity after 24 h at 80 °C. Active-site titration of TmGH1 using 2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro- -D-glucopyranoside revealed stoichiometric labeling of enzyme. ESI mass-spectrometry (not shown) gave masses of 51 750 and 51 584 Da for labeled and unlabeled native TmGH1, respectively, with 100% conversion of either enzyme form to the covalent intermediate. The mass difference of 166 Da is exactly that expected for a single 2-fluoro-glucosyl moiety on the labeled enzyme, and 3-D structure analysis, below, confirmed labeling of the catalytic nucleophile Glu351. TmGH1 activity, measured spectrophotometrically using 2,4-dinitrophenyl- -D-glucopyranoside as substrate (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 25 °C), gave kinetic parameters of kcat ) 42 ( 1 s-1 and KM ) 0.41 ( 0.03 mM. pH Dependence of Activity and Inhibition of TmGH1.

G.; White, A. H. Can. J. Chem. 2002, 80, 857-865). (15) Chromatographically pure almond -glucosidase as purchased from Sigma is a mixture of isozymes belonging to glycosidase family 1 (see ref 11). The material is subjected to lyophilization in the absence of salts, which may partly denature the enzyme. Stoichiometries of 1.7 and 1.0 were shown by affinity labeling of purified isozymes A and B, respectively, which had not been subjected to lyophilization.13 In a recent attempt to titrate the active sites of SIGMA almond -glucosidase using 13C NMR, a stoichiometry of 0.95 was observed (Hansen, S. U.; Plesner, I. W.; Bols, M. ChemBioChem 2000, 1, 177-180). However, the mass of the dimeric enzyme (MW ) 135 000 Da) was erroneously used in this calculation, thus in reality only 0.475 equiv of inhibitor bound per monomer (MW ) 67 000 Da).

curves generated at low substrate concentrations ([S] , KM). TmGH1 has maximal activity at pH 5.85, with acid and basic limbs displaying pKa's of 4.75 ((0.03) and 6.96 ((0.03), respectively (Figure 1), very similar to the values reported for the sweet almond enzyme.16 As with other related systems,17-20 this pH profile most likely represents titration of the nucleophile and acid/base, respectively. While linear steady-state rates were observed for TmGH1 in the presence of 1, slow-onset inhibition was observed for 2 at all pH values, even when the Ki had increased to low micromolar values (Figure 2). This suggests that the slow-onset inhibition of 2 is not merely a phenomenon of tight binding or the use of very low concentrations of inhibitor.21 Instead, this is more consistent with a unique mechanism of binding, perhaps mediated through a slow conformational change in the enzyme or an unusual change of ionization state of catalytic residues. Slowonset inhibition with 2 is also observed with the sweet almond enzyme which was attributed to slow bimolecular association with the enzyme.22 Others, based on fluorescence studies, suggest that slow-onset inhibition of almond -glucosidase may arise from a conformational change in the enzyme that leads to a high affinity complex.23,26 Interestingly, unlike 1, the parent compound nojirimycin exhibits slow-onset inhibition with the almond enzyme, as well as some 50-fold higher affinity.26 The pH dependencies of inhibition of TmGH1 with 1 and 2 also follow bell-shaped profiles but with pH optima of inhibition that are alkaline shifted relative to the pH optimum of catalysis for the enzyme (Figure 1). The pH profile for 1 has acid and basic limbs of pKa's 6.4 ((0.1) and 7.3 ((0.1), respectively, and a maximal Ki value of 3.8 µM (pH 6.85). The profile for 2 is more alkaline shifted, with pKa's of 6.6 ((0.1) and 8.6 ((0.2) and a maximal Ki value of 3.4 nM (pH 7.6). The Ki values for both inhibitors increase at the pH optimum of TmGH1 (9 µM for 1, 23 nM for 2, pH 5.85). As with the previous analyses of the binding of a cellobio-derived 2 to the cellulase Cel5A20 and the binding of iminosugars to an arabinofuranosidase,24 the pH

dependence of 1/Ki for 2 is most simply interpreted in terms of the protonated inhibitor binding to an enzyme species both of whose catalytic carboxylates are ionized; hence, the acidic pKa reflects protonation of the acid/base (pKa 6.96), while the alkaline pKa reflects the ionization of 2 (pKa 8.4).25 A similar interpretation of the pKa's of 1 is not possible because both values are equally distant from the acid-base pKa; likewise, the basic pKa of 1 for inhibition (pKa 7.3) is notably different from its measured pKa (6.3-6.7).10,25 Nevertheless, the pH profile for 1 indicates that it optimally interacts with a doubly ionized enzyme. It has long been argued that 1 binds to glucosidases (including almond) as the neutral amine despite the admitted ambiguity in assigning the pKa's of inhibition.10,26 As with the inhibition of Cel5A20 and other glycosidases10,24 by iminosugars, the inhibition of TmGH1 with 1 and 2 as a function of pH does not correlate with the pH dependence of kcat/KM of the enzyme. Optimal inhibition occurs at pH values where the acid-base of the enzyme becomes ionized and catalysis is reduced or absent. Indeed, optimal inhibition of TmGH1 by 2 occurs at a pH value where the enzyme displays greatly reduced activity. The data also emphasize why the literature tends to report inhibitor Ki values at a single pH value, chosen to maximize inhibition constants, rather than at the pH optimum for catalysis. At a minimum, we suggest that the Ki values at both optima should be reported. Thermodynamics of Binding of 1-Deoxynojirimycin and Isofagomine. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to dissect the thermodynamic contributions to binding of 1 and 2 to TmGH1. Kd values, at pH 5.8, determined by ITC to be 8 µM and 68 nM for 1 and 2, respectively, are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding Ki values of 9 µM and 23 nM, determined by kinetic means (Figure 3). In three different buffers and two different pH values (pH 5.8 and 7.0), the binding of both 1 and 2 to TmGH1 is predominantly driven by a large favorable change in enthalpy (Ha), in marked contrast to previous results using van't Hoff analyses (-ln Ki vs 1/T) of the sweet almond -glucosidase, discussed further below. The dependence of Ha on the heat of ionization of the buffer in which the experiment was performed gives a quantitative measure of proton transfer upon binding.27 Quantitative analysis of Ha in MES and citrate buffers (pH 5.8) gave negative values of nH+ of -1.03 ((0.11) for 1 and -0.96 ((0.04) for 2, consistent with the release of approximately one proton upon

binding either inhibitor. Based on the pH dependence of inhibition and on previous atomic resolution work on the structurally related endocellulase Cel5A in complex with a cellobio-derived form of 2, the acid-base of TmGH1 is expected to release a proton upon binding protonated 2 at pH 5.8. An indistinguishable scenario is that 1 or 2 first ionizes to a neutral form that binds TmGH1 and is subsequently protonated in the active site by the acid-base. Either situation would lead to the net release of a proton. Ha values of -7.93 ((0.22) and -6.81 ((0.11) kcal mol-1, in citrate buffer, or, when corrected for the heat of ionization, -8.75 and -7.58 kcal mol-1, are obtained for 1 and 2, respectively, at the pH optimum of the enzyme (Table 1). A notable dissimilarity in the binding of 1 and 2 to TmGH1 is the difference between the changes in entropy (TSa) [+3.09 ((0.11) kcal mol-1 for 2 as compared to -0.94 ((0.24) kcal mol-1 for 1]. Favorable entropic terms are observed for 2 relative to 1 in the other buffers as well, although the absolute values vary considerably (Table 1). Because the Ha values are relatively similar, it is essentially the large favorable entropy term that makes 2 a better inhibitor than 1, rather than greater enthalpy, although in both cases binding is dominated by large favorable enthalpies.

Markedly different heat capacities of association, Cp, are also observed for 1 and 2, as indicated by the very different temperature dependencies of Ha (Figure 4). Linear regression of these plots gives Cp values of -120.8 ((19.0) cal mol-1 K-1 for 1 and -50.1 ((3.6) cal mol-1 K-1 for 2. Cp is often considered to be a measure of solvent rearrangement in a molecular interaction;28 large negative values are thought to represent solvent release from apolar surfaces. However, this view is complicated by the observation of negative contributions to Cp from water molecules that become ordered at newly formed molecular interfaces (see below).29 Nevertheless, the discrepancy between the Cp's further highlights the differing thermodynamic signatures of interaction of 1 and 2 with TmGH1. An explanation for the differences in the binding thermodynamics is offered by considering the relative differences in the thermodynamic parameters for 1 and 2: Ha [)Ha (1) Ha (2) ) -1.17 kcal mol-1 (corrected for heat of ionization)], TSa ()TSa (1) - TSa (2) ) -4.03 kcal mol-1), and Cp ()Cp (1) - Cp (2) ) -70.7 ((31.3) cal mol-1 K-1). Favorable contributions to enthalpy, unfavorable contributions to entropy, and negative contributions to heat capacity are reminiscent of waters becoming ordered at a molecular interface.29,30 Estimates suggest that each water molecule that is ordered at an interface can contribute -0.5 to -3.0 kcal mol-1 to Ha,29,30 but this also has a corresponding negative effect on TSa.30,31 Furthermore, contributions of -48 to -60 cal mol-1 K-1 water-1 to Cp have been estimated for the ordering of a water molecule.29,32 On the basis of these values, our results would appear to be consistent with the binding of 1 incorporating approximately 1-3 more water molecules at the molecular interface relative to the binding of 2. Indeed, a single ordered

water molecule is observed to hydrogen bond to the N5 of 1 in the active site of TmGH1 (see crystallography below), similar to that observed in the xylanase, Cex.33 This water is not present in the crystal structure of TmGH1 in complex with 2. Although one may predict that incorporation of features into 1 that displace these water molecules would improve the entropic term,29 and hence the affinity of 1, N-methyl and N,N-dimethyl derivatives of 1 are known to be weaker inhibitors of almond -glucosidase.26,34 The reason for this requires further investigation. No information is available about the degree of solvation of 1 and 2 in free solution, and consequently interpretations based upon observation of one-half of an equilibrium must be treated with due caution. Indeed, it is possible that 2 is more conformationally restrained in bulk solution and therefore does not incur the same entropic penalty upon binding as was observed for 1. Likewise, different thermodynamic signatures for 1 and 2 can be expected at the temperature optimum of TmGH1 (80 °C) as the thermodynamic parameters are clearly temperature dependent. Reassessment of the Binding of 1 and 2 to Sweet Almond -Glucosidase. Given the stark contrast between the calorimetric data presented here for TmGH1 and the values obtained by van't Hoff methods on the related sweet almond -glucosidase (also from family GH-1) which instead suggest that binding of racemic 2 is driven by entropy, we performed calorimetric measurements on the sweet almond enzyme under the conditions used for van't Hoff work (phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). It is immediately and unambiguously apparent, as shown by the negative power deflections of the ITC data (Figure 5), that the binding of both 1 and (+)-2 to almond -glucosidase is exothermic and therefore enthalpically favorable. At 25 °C, the interaction of 1 with almond -glucosidase is dominated by a favorable Ha with a minor but favorable contribution to Sa (Table 2). At 35 °C, the interaction remains enthalpically driven but is partially offset by an unfavorable contribution to Sa. As observed for TmGH1, the calculated Sa values for (+)-2 at both temperatures are markedly favorable (Table 2), but binding is nevertheless dominated by Ha. Furthermore, nonstoichiometric titration of the theoretical number of active sites was observed with 1 and (+)-2 (n ) 0.35-0.38), confirming that commercial almond -glucosidase preparations are largely inactive, consistent with values obtained by others.15 It is evident that the continued use of sweet almond -glucosidase as the "workhorse" of -glycosidase inhibition is questionable. It is noteworthy that the calorimetric thermodynamic parameters for 1 binding to almond -glucosidase approximate those determined by a simple van't Hoff analysis. However, the

calorimetric and van't Hoff thermodynamic parameters for (+)-2 are profoundly different. Discrepancies between van't Hoff and calorimetric data are not without precedent,35 and their cause remains unclear.36 While in some cases these differences can be attributed to experimental error,36 there are notable cases in

which the calorimetric and van't Hoff values contrast sharply.37,38 This study appears to be another notable case. It is well known that the neglect of Cp in the van't Hoff analysis, which is significant for the binding of 1 and (+)-2, can result in relatively large errors in the calculated thermodynamic parameters.36 Also of concern is the ionization behavior of (+)-2 as well as conformational changes in almond -glucosidase that may occur upon inhibitor binding.23,26 Such equilibria linked to ligand binding have been proposed to obscure correct interpretation of van't Hoff analysis.36,37 Given the unambiguous release of heat upon binding of 1 and 2 to the sweet almond -glucosidase, plus essentially identical results obtained for TmGH1, we conclude that on both of these systems, in contrast to previous reports, the binding of 1 and 2 is dominated by favorable enthalpy. The greater prowess of 2 as compared to 1 is, however, due to its substantially more favorable entropy. To shed some light upon these unusual phenomena, the 3-D structure of TmGH1 was determined in native and trapped 2-fluoro glycosyl-enzyme intermediate forms and in complex with both 1 and (+)-2.

and have been omitted from some deposited models. Many features of TmGH1 are as described previously for other enzymes from the sequence family. The active site is located some 15-20 Å deep in a pocket with the "exo" nature of this glycosidase governed by Gln20, Glu405, and Trp406 around the -1 binding site. The structure of the covalent 2-fluoroglycosyl-enzyme intermediate was determined at 2.15 Å (Figures 6, 7a), confirming that Glu351 is the nucleophile in the reaction. The covalent-intermediate lies in a classical 4C1 conformation with a slight rotation of the nucleophile to avoid an unfavorable clash of the 2-fluoro group with the nucleophile carbonyl moiety, as observed on other systems. The structure of TmGH1 with 1, at 2.1 Å resolution, reveals binding in the -1 site as expected. The 2-hydroxyl (2-OH) of 1 hydrogen bonds to both the nucleophile and the Asn165 (the signature interactions of clan GH-A39); 3-OH bonds to His121, Trp406, and the side-chain carbonyl of Gln20; 4-OH bonds to the amide of Gln20, Trp398, and the carboxylate of Glu405; and 6-OH bonds to the side chain of Glu405 (Figures 7b, 8a). All hydrogen bond distances are around 2.8-3.1 Å ((0.2 Å). Maximum-likelihood refinement with no restraint on pyranoside torsion angles causes distortion of 1 from 4C1 with C1 slightly displaced upward (toward 4H3 and 1S3) allowing the nucleophile to interact with both O2 and N5 of 1. Given that such distortion has not been observed on other glycosidase structures with derivatives of 1,33,40 it is unclear whether this motion reflects a genuine distortion driven by van der Waals' contacts with the nucleophile and H-bond optimization or is a consequence of medium resolution data. The closest approach of the carboxylate oxygen of the nucleophile to C1 is approximately 3 Å. Of particular note are the interactions of the N5 nitrogen. This atom

makes one clear hydrogen bond to a solvent water molecule. A second water molecule is not evident from the electron density; indeed Tyr295 lies approximately 3.6 Å "below" N5 and thus blocks the potential interaction with the lone pair (or proton) of N5. In this way, TmGH1 would appear to be different in its N5 interactions with family 10 xylanases33,40 where two water molecules coordinate N5. The binding of 2 to TmGH1 at a resolution of 2.15 Å reveals similar interactions at the 3-OH, 4-OH, and 6-OH positions (Figures 7c, 8b) and adopts a relaxed 4C1 conformation. Unlike 1, however, the interaction of 2 with TmGH1 does not involve ordered water molecules. N1 lies 2.6 Å from the carboxylate OE1 oxygen of the nucleophile Glu351, suggesting a tight electrostatic interaction. Likewise, the acid/base catalyst also appears to form a Coulombic interaction with N1 (3.1 Å). Although the resolution of these structures does not allow direct observation of the ionization state of 2 and the catalytic apparatus, an atomic resolution structure for Cel5A with the cellobio-derivative of 220 provides precedent for the inhibitor binding to a doubly ionized enzyme. This clamping mode of

binding N1 between the nucleophile and the acid/base has also been observed on a -N-acetylhexosaminidase with a derivative of 2.41 Transition-State Mimics or Fortuitous Binders? By definition, a "transition-state mimic" is never perfect and will not capture all of the binding energy available in an enzyme active site for the reaction transition state. In assessing a transitionstate analogue, one is forced to determine what enzyme-inhibitor interactions are relevant to transition-state binding, as well as what interactions are absent. The three-dimensional structures of inhibitor complexes can identify interactions with enzyme active site residues, and these can be compared to what is known about transition-state stabilization from biochemical studies. The correlation of Ki with kcat/KM in pH profiles or linear free energy relationships (LFERs),1 as well as the thermodynamic parameters for binding, offer an objective means of grading a transition-state mimic.4,5 Certainly 1 and 2 achieve some semblance of the glucosidase

Figure 8. A scheme of 1 and 2 bound to TmGH1. The protonated form of 2 is based upon pH profiles and the published atomic resolution structure of a related enzyme,20 while 1 is shown unprotonated as there is currently no unambiguous proof as to its ionization state; the most likely binding form at pH 5.8 would be with a partially protonated form of 1.

transition state as both have been successfully used as haptens to elicit catalytic antibodies that exhibit glucosidase activity.42,43 These activities, not surprisingly, are very low relative to natural enzymes. Likewise, both 1 and 2 bind to -glucosidases with large and favorable enthalpies, as expected for transition-state analogues.5 However, a deficiency with 1 and 2 as transitionstate mimics is the absence of constraint into a 4H3 conformation (any distortion must necessarily pay an energetic cost). 2 is also compromised by the absence of a 2-hydroxyl and thus is unable to form known key catalytic interactions with the nucleophile and Asn165.44 It is known that the substrate 2-OH contributes at least 4.5 kcal mol-1 to transition-state stabilization by family 1 -glucosidases45 (and up to 10 Kcal mol-1 in other glycosidases46) whereas the remaining hydroxyl groups contribute 1-2 kcal mol-1. However, an analogue of 2 bearing a 2-hydroxyl, noeuromycin, is not a significantly better inhibitor of retaining -glycosidases, including almond (although, interestingly, noeuromycin is a substantially better inhibitor of R-glycosidases).44 This is indicative of a lack of transition-state character, as modifications of the analogue do not affect Ki in a way that correlates with changes in the kcat/KM value upon an equivalent change in a substrate.1 Likewise, no correlation between Ki and kcat/KM in a LFER was observed with a family 1 -glucosidase and 1.9 Thus, the affinities of 1 and 2 would appear to stem predominantly from interactions that are not equivalent to those in the -glucosidase transition state. One possibility with 2 is the electrostatic interaction of the acid/base with the "anomeric" N1. This interaction dominates the pH dependence of Ki, rather than the nucleophile, as had been assumed previously.12 The consequence of this interaction is that 2 binds optimally to a doubly ionized and largely inactive enzyme as shown by the pH profile in Figure 1, indicating that this interaction is not pKa optimized, or perhaps catalytically irrelevant.

Although 2 is thought to be a better mimic than 1 of the -glucosidase transition state, the fact that the superior inhibition of 2 is derived solely from entropy, a thermodynamic term not observed to dominate transition-state binding by enzymes, casts doubt on this view. Likewise, the notably weaker temperature dependence of Ha for 2 relative to 1 is also at odds with the strong temperature dependence of Hq observed for enzymecatalyzed reactions, as well as Ha of "good" transition-state mimics.4,5 Intriguingly, favorable (even dominant) TSa values and unusually low Ha values were observed in a calorimetric study of the binding of phosphonate transition-state analogues to an esterase catalytic antibody.47 This was attributed to desolvation of complementary charges on the transition-state analogues and antibody active site residues upon binding without forming equally compensating electrostatic interactions. In this scenario, desolvation of the charged groups contributes favorably to TSa, but the resulting electrostatic interactions fail to contribute favorably to Ha. Nonoptimized electrostatic interactions may well be the reason for the poor catalytic activity of the antibody. An analogous explanation for the thermodynamic parameters of positively charged 2 is also possible. As more transition-state analogues are characterized by calorimetry in parallel with correlations between Ki and kcat/KM, a better understanding of what is an ideal thermodynamic signature for a transition-state analogue will emerge.

Glycosidase Inhibition by Iminosugars the N-terminus, herein called pET-28a-TmGH1-His6. Heat shock competent E. coli cells (BL21) were transformed with pET-28aTmGH1-His6 and selected on LB-agarose plates containing 50 µg/mL kanamycin. Transformed cells were grown in TYP media (50 µg/mL kanamycin) at 37 °C (140 rpm) to a high OD600 of 3, induced with 0.5 mM IPTG, and allowed to grow overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min), resuspended in 10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7, and then lysed by sonication. Benzonuclease (Novagen) was added to digest the DNA. After centrifugation (15 000 rpm, 20 min), the supernatant was heated to 75 °C for 20 min. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation (15 000 rpm, 20 min), and the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+ agarose column (Novagen). TmGH1-His6 was eluted using a step gradient of imidazole, affording >95% pure protein as judged by SDS-PAGE. The yield of TmGH1-His6 was approximately 15 mg L-1. A TmGH1 construct lacking a His6 tag was obtained by subcloning the NdeI/HindIII fragment derived from pET-28a-TmGH1-His6 into the NdeI/HindIII sites of pET-22b (Novagen), yielding the plasmid pET22b-TmGH1. Heat shock competent E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with pET-22b-TmGH1 and selected on LB-agarose plates containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Transformed cells were grown in LB media (100 µg/mL ampicillin) to an OD 600 nm of 0.6, induced with 0.5 mM IPTG, and then allowed to grow overnight. Extra ampicillin was added after 8 h (50 µg/mL). The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mM BisTris propane, pH 6.8, and lysed by sonication. Benzonuclease was added to digest the DNA. Following centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was heated to 75 °C for 20 min. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and a concentrated ammonium sulfate solution (pH 7) was added to the supernatant to achieve a final concentration of 1.0 M. The supernatant was loaded onto a Phenyl Sepharose High Performance column (Pharmacia), washed with 5 column volumes of 1.0 M ammonium sulfate, and then eluted with a linear gradient to 0 M ammonium sulfate, 20 mM BisTris Propane, over 10 column volumes. The TmGH1 fraction was pooled, concentrated and dialyzed into 20 mM BisTris Propane, pH 6.8, and then loaded onto a Sepharose Q column (Pharmacia). After the column was washed with 5 column volumes of 20 mM BisTris Propane, TmGH1 was eluted using a linear gradient to 500 mM NaCl. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated single band purity for the pooled fractions. MALDI-MS analysis (sinapinic acid matrix) gave masses of 51 751 and 53 941 Da for TmGH1 and TmGH1-His6, respectively. Active Site Labeling and ESI-MS Analysis. TmGH1 and TmGH1His6 (10-65 µM) were incubated with an excess of 2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro- -D-glucopyranoside (180 µM) in 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) at room temperature for 3 h. Volumes of enzyme and buffer were determined by mass on an analytical balance. The 2,4dinitrophenol released was quantified spectrophotometrically at 400 nm using an extinction coefficient of 10 910 M-1 cm-1.48 The absorbance values were corrected by a blank solution containing only inactivator, incubated under the same conditions. An assay of activity after 3 h using 4-nitrophenyl -D-glucopyranoside indicated >99.9% of the enzyme had been inactivated. The concentration of the enzyme stock solutions was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient 118 630 M-1 cm-1 (calculated from the amino acid sequence49). From these data, n values of 0.826 ((0.004) and 0.835 ((0.007) were calculated for TmGH1-His6 and TmGH1, respectively. The 2,4-dinitrophenolate extinction coefficient was also determined under our experimental conditions (according to ref 48), affording a value of 8890 M-1 cm-1. Using this coefficient, n values of 1.014 ((0.004) and 1.025 ((0.007) were calculated for TmGH1-His6 and TmGH1, respectively. ESI-MS analysis (performed by Shouming He, Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia) gave masses of 51 750 and 51 584 Da for labeled and unlabeled TmGH1, respec(48) Kempton, J.

Activity was monitored spectrophotometrically using 2,4-dinitrophenyl -D-glucopyranoside as a substrate. Solutions of substrate in 100 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mg mL-1 BSA, pH 7.0 (total volume of 750 µL), were equilibrated at 25 °C. Reaction was initiated by the addition of a small volume of enzyme (2.5-5 µL), and 2,4-dinitrophenol release was monitored continuously at 400 nm ( 400 ) 8890 M-1 cm-1). Concentrations of substrate ranged from 0.01 to 2.1 mM, and enzyme concentrations ranged from 10 to 20 nM. The Michaelis Menten equation was fit to the data using GraFit.50 Virtually identical kinetic parameters were calculated for TmGH1-His6 (kcat ) 42 ( 1 s-1, KM ) 0.41 ( 0.03 mM) and for TmGH1 (kcat ) 42 ( 1 s-1, KM ) 0.30 ( 0.02 mM). pH Dependence of kcat/KM. Approximate values of kcat/KM as a function of pH for the reaction of TmGH1 with 2,4-dinitrophenyl -Dglucopyranoside were calculated from first-order rate curves generated at low substrate concentrations ([S] , Km). Assays were performed at 25 °C and consisted of 12.6 µM substrate, 86 mM buffer, and 1 mg mL-1 BSA (total volume 750 µL). The reaction was initiated by addition of a small volume of TmGH1 (5-10 µL) to afford a final concentration of 33-110 nM enzyme. The following buffers were used for each pH range: 86 mM citrate, pH 4-6; 86 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6-8. Overlapping data from citrate and phosphate buffers, as well as halving the concentration of buffer, indicated no significant buffer effects on rates. BSA was omitted below pH 5 due to precipitation in this range. TmGH1 was stable at all pH values within the time range of the assay (10-20 min). 2,4-Dinitrophenol release was monitored continuously at 400 nm for at least 5 half-lives (10-20 min), and the resulting time course was fit to a first-order rate equation (eq 1) using GraFit. The rate constant calculated for the curve (k ) Vmax/KM), adjusted for the concentration of enzyme, affords an approximate value for kcat/KM. The data were fit with a bell ionization curve (eq 2) using GraFit to determine the pKa values. Identical buffer solutions were used for the pH dependence of 1/Ki (described below).

In the case of 1, values of Vmax/Km were determined from pseudo-firstorder rate curves in the presence and absence of inhibitor. Inhibition assays contained 15 µM 2,4-dinitrophenyl -D-glucopyranoside, 1 mg mL-1 BSA (except below pH 5), and 89 mM buffer. The concentration of 1 was typically 1-10 times the final Ki value. TmGH1 concentrations ranged from 35 to 270 nM. Values of Ki are the average of duplicate or triplicate measurements of (Vmax/KM)i and (Vmax/KM)0. The dependence 1/Ki versus pH was fit to eq 2 with GraFit. Slow-onset inhibition was observed with 2 at all pH values (Figure 2). This behavior prevented determination of Ki under pseudo-firstorder rate conditions as described for 1. Rather, Ki values for 2 were determined under steady-state conditions at low substrate concentrations ([S] , Km) from ratios of Vi and Vo.

TmGH1 was dialyzed extensively into 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mM MES, pH 5.8, or 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.8, using a stirred ultrafiltration cell (Amicon) and a 10 kDa cutoff polyether sulfone membrane (Millipore). Samples for use in ITC were diluted to appropriate concentrations in dialysate buffer saved from the ultrafiltration step. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, as described above. Chromatographically pure almond -glucosidase containing 99% protein (Lot 58H4074) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Samples for ITC were prepared by weight in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The protein concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient 280 ) 103 000 ((8000) calculated from the average of theoretical 280 values of 10 randomly chosen family 1 glycosidases.49 All samples were filtered with 0.2 µm cutoff filters (Sartorius) and extensively degassed with stirring prior to use. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed using a MCS ITC (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). Inhibitor samples were prepared by weight in buffer saved from the dialysis of TmGH1 or in the same 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, as that in which the almond -glucosidase was prepared. Inhibitor samples were filtered and degassed before use. Titrations were performed by injecting 5 or 10 µL aliquots of 1 (3000 µM) or 2 (485 µM) solution into the ITC sample cell (volume ) 1.35 mL) containing TmGH1 or almond -glucosidase.

All ITC data were corrected for the heat of dilution of the titrant by subtracting the excess heats at high molar ratios of inhibitor to enzyme.

Changes in heat capacity (Cp) were determined by the temperature dependence of Ha as described previously.52 The number of protons released or absorbed (nH+) upon binding of TmGH1 and inhibitor were determined by measuring apparent enthalpies of association (Happ) in two different buffers (100 mM MES or citrate, a pH 5.8) that exhibit significantly different enthalpies of ionization (Hi) according to eq 4.27 Values of Hi ) -0.8 kcal mol-1 for citrate and

Crystallization and X-ray Analysis of TmGH1 and Inhibitor Complexes. Crystals of TmGH1-His6 were grown overnight at 18 °C by the hanging drop method. A 2:1 ratio of enzyme solution (10 mg mL-1 in 50 mM imidazole, pH 7) to crystallization buffer (15% PEG 4 K, 0.2 M CaAc2, 0.1 M imidazole, pH 7) proved to be optimal. The crystals were soaked briefly (3-10 s) in crystallization buffer containing 20% glycerol prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. TmGH1-His6 in complex with 2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro- -glucoside, 1, and 2 were obtained by equilibrating selected crystals in solution containing 10 mM inhibitor (3 mM for 2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro- glucoside) for 3-5 h. Prior to freezing, the crystals were soaked briefly (3-10 s) in crystallization buffer containing 20% glycerol as above. X-ray diffraction data, to 2.1 Å resolution, were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Source beam-lines ID14-EH4 and ID14-EH2 using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD as detector. Data were processed and reduced using DENZO/SCALEPACK from the HKL suite.54 All further computing used the CCP4 suite55 of programs unless otherwise stated. Despite the equivalence in length of the crystallographic a and b axes, crystals of TmGH1-His6 are in orthorhombic space-group P212121 with approximate cell dimensions a ) 94.3 Å, b ) 94.4 Å, c ) 113.1 Å, R ) )  ) 90°. The TmGH1-His6 structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe56 with the Bacillus circulans family 1 -glucosidase, 1qox, as the search model with data from 30 to 4 Å and with an outer radius of Patterson integration of 25 Å. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules of TmGH1-His6, consistent with its dimeric state in solution. Following structure solution, 5% of the observations were set aside for cross-validation analysis57 and were used to guide refinement strategies such as geometric weighting and the modeling of solvent water. The structures were refined by maximum-likelihood methods using REFMAC58 with manual correction of the model using QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego Ca). Refinement of TmGH1-His6 in complex with ligands followed standard procedures, with identical cross-validation reflections maintained, and with ligand geometry target values calculated using QUANTA. Coordinates and observed structure factor amplitudes have been deposited with the
