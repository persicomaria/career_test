The anticancer drug daunomycin has been co-crystallized with the hexanucleotide duplex sequences d(TGTACA) and d(TGATCA) and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of these and two complexes have been carried out. Structure solution of the d(TGTACA) d(TGATCA) complexes to 1.6 and 1.7 A resolution, respectively, shows two daunomycin molecules bound to the DNA hexamer. Binding occurs via intercalation of the drug chromophore at the d(TpG) step, and hydrogen bonding interactions involving the drug, DNA and solvent molecules. The daunomycin sugar is located in the minor groove of the DNA hexamer and is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the amino group of the sugar and functional groups on the floor of the groove. The amino sugar of the d(TGATCA) duplex interacts directly with the DNA sequence, while in the d(TGTACA) duplex, the interaction is via solvent molecules. Two other complexes d(CGTACG)-daunomycin and d(CGATCG)daunomycin have previously been structurally characterized. Comparison of the four structures with daunomycin bound to the triplet sequences 5'TGT, 5'TGA, 5'CGT and 5'CGA reveals changes in the conformation of both the DNA hexamer and the daunomycin upon complexation, as well as the hydrogen bonding and van der Waals' interactions.

1. Introduction The cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic daunomycin is derived from Streptomyces peucetius and is used in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (Crooke & Reich, 1980). Daunomycin consists of an aromatic aglycon chromophore and an amino sugar (Fig. 1). The antitumour activity of daunomycin has been attributed to intercalation of the planar aglycone chromophore between the DNA base-pairs (Arcamone, 1981), which inhibits both DNA replication and RNA transcription (diMarc et al., 1974; Neidle, 1979). Single crystal X-ray diffraction structure determinations of daunomycin complexed with the hexadeoxynucleotides d(CGTACG) (Quigley et aE., 1980;

Wang et al., 1987) and d(CGATCG) (Moore et al., 1989; Frederick et al., 1990) confirm that the aglycon moiety (rings B to D) intercalates between the G *C base-pairs. The chromophore is oriented at right-angles to the long axis of the DNA base-pairs. The position of the drug is stabilized by direct and solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds to the nucleotide bases and to the sugar-phosphate backbone. The amino sugar lies in the minor groove and interacts with the DNA in a sequence-dependent manner. Both hexamers adopt a B-DNA conformation, with local modifications at the intercalation site. There is evidence, both theoretical and experimental, that daunomycin recognizes specific sites on long stretches of DNA. Theoretical studies (Chen et al., 1985; Pullman, 1987) have suggested that it preferentially recognizes a triplet sequence, with the sequences 5'GCT and 5'CGA being the most energetically favoured. DNase I digestion patterns of DNA of natural origin, the 160 bpll tyrT promoter, in the presence of daunomycin have established that

this drug does have sequence preference. The preferred sites all contain the type of triplet sequences predicted by theoretical studies (Chaires et al., 1987). In the experiment 5'CG was observed as the most frequent dinucleotide in all "protected" regions. In contrast, a subsequent study identified the dinucleotide sequence 5'TG as the preferred binding site (Skorobogaty et al., 1988a,b). Recent results from a high-resolution DNase I footprinting titration procedure identified the most strongly preferred daunomycin binding site to be the triplet sequences B'CGA, 5'CGT, 5'GCA and 5'GCT, indicating that either A or T may occupy the position neighbouring the intercalation site (Chaires et al., 1990). Triplets 5'TGA and B'TGT also occur in strongly protected sites that do not contain 5'CGA or 5'CGT sequences. We have studied two deoxyoligonucleotide hexamers, d(TGTACA) and d(TGATCA) complexed with daunomycin, by X-ray diffraction techniques. The two complexes will be referred to in this paper as TGT-daun and TGA-daun, respectively.

TGT-daun and 1.7 A for TGA-daun. (Jrystala of both complexes were unstable and a number of crystals (13 for 9 for TGA-daun), were used to obtain TGT-daun, complete datasets for t,he 2 complexes. The decay in diffraction intensity occurred very rapidly within about 1 h and no decomposition greater than 2 % was tolerated. using SHELX76 The data were scaled together (Sheldrick. 1976), which derived and applied batch scale factors for t'he common reflections for each dataset using linear least-squares. Mean cell dimensions of a = 2&02 A. c = 5271 d and a = 2&l 1 A. c = 52.88 A were obtained for TGT-daun and TGA-daun, respectively. The mean crystal size for both complexes was @15 mm x (k 15 mm x 0.4 mm. A total of 8504 reflections were recorded for = TGT-daun, of which 4852 were unique (Elmerge @05) and 2440 were observed at the 20(F) level. For TGA-daun. 4475 reflections were collected, of which 2626 were unique Plugs = 0.12) and 2094 were observed at the da(F) level. but All intensities were corrected for Lorenz-polarization. due to crystal instability. no absorption csorrection was applied. (c ) Re$nement The co-ordinates of d(CGTACG)--daunomycin (Wang e/ al., 1987) were used as a starting model for the R-value minimization program RMINIM of t,he MERLOT package (Fitzgerald. 1988) in space group P4,2,2. The adenine and thymine base positions in the helix were interchanged for the TGA-daun complex using an Evans and Sutherland PS300 graphics system and the FRODO program (Jones, 1978). Further refinement was carried out with the restrained least-squares method of Hendrickson & Konnert (1981) using the program NUCLSQ (Westhof et al., 1985), with the same st,rategy as described by Moore et al. (1989). Refinement of positional and thermal parameters prior to the addition of any solvent molecules was carried out using 10 to 2 a 20(F) data. The refinement converged to give a residual R value of @28 for TGT--daun. and R of' 034 for TGA--daun. At this stage t,he first electron and difference electron density maps were calculated and the sequence was adjusted. The methyl group on residue Tt was located from the difference density map. Solvent molecules were added throughout the refinement. none of which could be unambiguously regarded as a cation. Acceptance criteria were similar to those used previously in this laboratory (Hunter et al.. 1986). For TGT-daun the refinement converged at IZ = 0% (R, = @18) for 1811 30(F) reflections in the range 10 to 1.6 A. Fifty solvent water positions were included. TGA-m daun converged at R = 0.26 (R, = @20) for 1885 3o(F) reflections in the range 10 to 1.7 A with the inclusion of 57 solvent molecules. To check the correctness of the space group assignment, R values were calculated in space group P4,2,2. In both complexes the R value rose to 0.34. confirming P4,2,2 as the correct space group.

(a) Synthesis am? crystallization The 2 self-complementary DNA hexamers d(TGTACA) and d(TGATCA) were synthesized and co-crystallized with daunomycin using the procedure described by Moore et al. (1989). (b) Data collection Precession photography showed systematic absences consistent with space groups P4,2,2 and P4,2,2, and the cell constants suggested isomorphism with the d(CGTACG)-daunomycin complex (Quigley et al., 1980; Wang et al., 1987) and d(CGATCG)-daunomycin complex (Moore et al., 1989; Frederick et al., 1990). Crystals were sealed in Lindemann glass capillaries with a small amount of mother liquor for X-ray diffraction data collection using a Syntex P2, diffractometer, equipped with a graphite monochromator, long arm and helium path. For both complexes w-scan data collection was carried out at 2°C with CuKa radiation, recording the reflections in a complete o&ant to a resolution of 15 A (1 A = @I nm) for

The solvent oxygen atoms are numbered progressively from Wl onwards. One single strand of DNA together with the daunomycin comprise the asymmetric unit, with a crystallographic dyad relating the two strands to form a duplex. Figure 2 shows the TGT-daun and TGAdaun complexes.

(a) DNA conformation Both the TGT-daun and TGA-daun complexes form right-handed B-DNA-like duplexes with Watson-Crick base-pairing. The torsion angles for

the oligonucleotide backbone and glycosyl bond for the two complexes are shown in Table 1. These values, similar to those previously observed for the d(CGTACG)-daunomycin and d(CGATCG)daunomycin complexes (Wang et al., 1987; Moore et al., 1989; Frederick et al., 1996), will be referred to as CGT-daun and CGA-daun in this paper. They also have a B-type conformation with values close to those previously observed for the B-DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) (Dickerson & Drew, 1981), as shown in Table 1. Differences exist at the site of the intercalation. The phosphodiester linkage along the DNA backbone in the 5' to 3' direction shows a -synclinal(a) - synclinal( 5) conformation for the central d(T3pA4) and d(A4pC5) steps of TGT-daun, with

For the d(G2pT3) step of TGT-daun, a - synclinal(cr) - anticlinal([) step compares with that of -synclinal(cr) +antiperiplanar([) for the d(G2pA3) step of TGA-daun, with the d(C5pA6) steps for both TGT-daun and TGA-daun -synclinal(cr) + antiperiplanar( 5). Corresponding changes occur in the E angle of C5 for both complexes. The /I angle for T3 and A3 does not show a reduction comparable to that observed in the CGT-daun and CGA-daun structures.

to that observed for the CGT-daun complex. Majoi deviations from B-DNA conformation occur near the intercalation site, with significant buckling of the terminal Tl . Al2 base-pair (10" for TGT-daun. 11" for TGA-daun). The G2. Cl 1 base-pair on the other side of the chromophore is buckled at 20" in the opposite direction for both complexes. In both complexes the major contribution to this buckle is the inclination angle (23") for the base C5 (Cl]), which lies close to the amino sugar. The cup values (x) (Yanagi et al., 1991) for the TpG step in TGTdaun and TGA-daun are 30" and 31°, respectively, with these two base-pairs enclosing the drug like two cupped hands. For TGT-daun, base-pair T3. A10 has a large roll angle of 10" and the terminal Tl . Al2 base-pair for both structures tip at 13" and 14" for TGT-daun and TGA-daun, respectively. The stacking interactions between the aglycon chromophore and its intercalation site base-pairs are shown in Figure 3(a). The position of the chromophore is similar in both complexes. The orientation and conformation of the amino sugar is, however, different. The base-stacking interactions at the neighbouring steps are shown in Figure 3(b) and (c). Due to the intercalation the G2 *Cl 1 basepair has moved towards the major groove. This reduces overlap with T3 *A10 in TGT-daun, and with A3. TlO in TGA-daun. In both complexes greater overlap occurs for the guanine sixmembered ring and thymine O-4 or adenine N-6 as compared to the corresponding CGT-daun and CGA-daun complexes. The third stacking interaction gives a comparison of TpA and ApT steps in an otherwise identical sequence. In TGT-daun there is very little overlap for the T3pA4 step, typical of pyrimidine-purine stacking in B-DNA. The usual interstrand stacking pattern found for ApT steps (as

d(G2pT3) and d(G2pA3) steps show smaller twist angles of 28.3" and 2&l" in order to accommodate the drug molecule. For CGT-daun and CGA-daun, the twist at the intercalation site d(ClpG2) was 34.9" and 33.4", and smaller than observed for the d(TlpG2) twist angles. The base-pair helical rise (C-l' to C-l') for the intercalation site is 53 A for TGT-daun and 5-l A for TGA-daun.

A least-squares plane (Blow, 1960) was calculated for all the ring and exocyclic atoms of B, C and D for TGT-daun and TGA-daun. Two deviations greater than 0.1 A were found for TGT-daun, with C-21 lying at 024 A to one side of the BCD plane and O-4 at 919 A on the other side. For TGA-daun, atoms O-11 and O-12 deviate by 910 A and 911 A from the plane. Torsional angles for the ring A, glycosyl linkage and amino sugar are listed in Table 4. In the TGAdaun structure ring A atoms C-19, C-20, C-7, C-9 and C-10 are close to coplanar, with a maximum deviation of 0.06 A (C-20).

Figure 5 shows the superposition of the TGT-daun and TGA-daun complex, together with CGT-daun and CGA-daun, fitted with the structure of daunomycin co-crystallized with butanol (Courseille et al., 1979). The greatest conformational differences are observed in the region of the aglycon ring A and amino sugar moieties. The amino sugar torsion angles differ from those observed for the uncomplexed daunomycin (Courseille et al., 1979) and for CGT-daun and CGA-daun in which the sugar ring adopts a chair conformation. For TGA-daun the conformation is an unsymmetric boat, with atoms C-l', C-3', C-4' and O-5' coplanar and C-5' and C-2' displaced in a direction away from the aglycon by 017 d and 061 A, respectively. N-3 and O-4' similarly project away from the aglycon. For the amino sugar moiety in TGT--daun, atoms C-3', C-4', C-5' and O-5' are close to coplanar (maximum deviation @025a for C-5').

In both complexes the aglycon chromophore of the daunomycin intercalates between the TpG sites at each end of the hexamer duplex. The amino sugar is situated in the minor groove. Figure 6 views TGT-daun and TGA-daun towards the minor groove to illustrate the position of the daunomycin and the hydrogen bonding interactions. Figure 7 shows a two-dimensional scheme detailing the hydrogen bonding between the daunomycin and DNA for the TGT-daun and TGA-daun complexes. In both complexes the hydroxyl oxygen atom O-9 is within hydrogen bonding distance of residue G2. A strong hydrogen bond is formed between O-9 and N-3 (G2) with O-9. * * N-3 separations of 2.6 d (TGT-daun) and 2.7 L%(TGA-daun). Atom N-2 of residue G2 forms a hydrogen bond to O-9 of the daunomycin for both complexes with N-2 ... O-9 separations of 3.3 L%(TGT-daun) and 3.2 a (TGAdaun). Atom O-9 for TGT-daun has a short van der Waals' contact of 3.1 L% with O-4' of residue G2. In both complexes N-2 of residue G2 lies close to O-7 with a separation of 3.1 A for both structures. This is the oxygen that links the chromophore and the amino sugar. As previously observed in the structure determinations of CGT-daun and CGA-daun (Wang et al., 1987; Moore et al., 1989; Frederick et al., 1990) atom O-13 of TGT-daun is hydrogen bonded to water molecule W16 which, in turn, hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen atom O-2 of the terminal base Tl. For TGA-daun W29 hydrogen bonds to O-13 without further interaction. The difference in co-ordination of O-13 in the two complexes may be accounted for by the differences in ring A geometry.

Figure 7. Two-dimensional (idealized) diagrams to show the hydrogen bonding to daunomycin in (a) TGTdaun and (b) TGA-daun.

For TGT-daun, O-5 lies close to N-l of residue C5 with a separation of 3.0 A. In TGA-daun there is a bridging water molecule W35 hydrogen bonded to O-4 and O-5 of the daunomycin with further hydrogen bonding via WI9 to the phosphate oxygen atom 0-1P of residue A6. The hydrogen bonded interactions of the amino sugar group in the two complexes are different. For TGT-daun, the amino group hydrogen bonds to two water molecules, WI0 and W35, with separations for both of 2.8 A. W35 further interacts with O-2 of residue T3 (2.9 8) and O-4' of residue A4 (2.4 A). The hydroxyl oxygen atom O-4' lies in close proximity to three water molecules, W18, W39 and W42, with separations of 2.6 A, 2.7 A and 3.1 A, respectively. W39 further interacts with O-5' of the daunomycin at a distance of 2.9 A.

et al. mediated interaction for all of the complexes except' TGT-daun, in which no such contact was found. The sugar amino group hydrogen bonds with bases T3, 44, TIO, A10 and Cl 1. For the DNA sequences EGA there is direct hydrogen bonding with atoms O-2 (TlO), O-2 (Cll) and either a water or O-4' (Cl 1). For the DNA sequences $GT a watermediated interaction exists to O-4' ( 4) and N-3 (A4) or O-2 (T3). In addition, a water is bound to the amino sugar and, in the case of CGT-daun. there may be an interaction to O-2 (Cl 1). For adriamycin analogues it has been found that' significant variation in the stereochemistry of the amino sugar group does not effect. the antitumour efficiency of the drug molecule (Henry, 1979). The 4'-hydroxyl group of daunomycin is axial and interacts solely with water-solvent atoms. Theoretical studies on the interaction between daunomycin and several DNA hexamer sequences (Pullman, 1989) have been reported. These calculations predict, t,hat an 4. T base-pair at the centre of the DNA is more stable than a G .C base-pair in this position. The cryst'al structures so far reported indicate that the hydrogen bonding interactions of t.hc: daunomycin sugar amino group with the central A . T pairs are very important for drug stabilization. If a G .C base-pair is substitut'ed in t,his central position. repulsion between the daunomycin and the guanine amino group may occur. Another impor tant interaction observed in the crystal structures is the binding of the O-9 hydroxyl with a guanine at the 2 to 11 base-pair st,ep of the DNA hexamer. This agrees with the results of the theoretical work. which calculates that a guanine at, this step would increase the stability of these complexes. The sequence preference of daunomycin has been investigat>ed by DNase I footprinting and an RNA inhibit)ion assay transcription polymerase (Skorobagat,y et nl., 1988a,6). The work suggests t'hat daunomycin binds preferentiallv to the dinucleotide 5'CA with modest binding affinity for 5'Gfr. CG, CT, TC and AC. From structural work it is now known that daunomycin binds to a three-base-pair site on the DNA. A high resolution DNase T footprinting study (Chaires et al., 1990) has shown that referentially binds to the triplet daunomycin AI 5'$GC and 5'*c(; sequences of DNA in solution. and possibly also to the sequence !?&A. These results are in agreement. with X-ray struct,ural observations. The X-ray structure analyses of the various daunomycin DNA daunomycin and modified complexes discussed in this paper have yielded a wealth of information about this particular drugreceptor syst,em. Further studies on different triplet sequences are planned in our laboratory aimed at a more detailed understanding of the interaction in the complexes, which might eventually lead t,o a rational modification of the drug molecule t,o improve sequence specificity.

0-2(T4), 0-2(C5) and 0-4'(C5) are 3.1 A. 2.6 d and 28 A, respectively. The hydroxyl oxygen atom O-4' hydrogen bonds to water molecules W18 (3.3 A) and W39 (2.7 A). W39 also interacts with O-5' (3.1 A). Similar interactions were observed for TGT-daun. (d) Solvent

The hydration sites in both of the structures are within hydrogen bonding distances of the DNA hexamer and daunomycin. In the case of TGTdaun. 50 water positions were located during the structure refinement, with thermal parameters (8) in the range of 9 to 61 A2. For the TGA-daun complex, 57 water molecules were identified and included in the refinement with B values varving from 8 to 73 A2. No spermine molecules or cations could be located.

4. Discussion
Since 1980 structural characterizations of the four daunomycin-DNA hexamer complexes, CGT-daun, CGA-daun, TGT-daun and TGA-daun have been carried out. We can comment on the common features observed in these structures. Recently, the X-ray crystal structures of two covalent adducts and the DNA hexamers between daunomycin d(CGCGCG) and d(CGTDCG) (D = 2-aminoadenine) have been reported (Wang et al., 1991). In these complexes a methylene group links the amino sugar group with the N-2 atom of guanine or 2-aminoadenine. In addition, the crystal structures of a number of complexes between DNA hexamers and slightly modified daunomycin molecules have been They include d(CGATCG)-adriamycin studied. (14-hydroxyldaunomycin; Frederick et aE., 1990)) d(CGATCG)-4'-epiadriamycin (Williams et al., 199oa) and d(CGTsACG)-1 I-deoxydaunomycin (Williams et al., 1990b). 4'-Epiadriamycin differs from adriamycin with inversion of the stereochemistry at the 4' position. of the drug in the daunomycin Stabilization complexes is achieved by the intercalation of the aromatic aglycon chromophore of the drug into the hexamer, which results in n--n stacking and dipoledipole interactions, the hydrogen bonding interactions between the drug and DNA base-pairs and through van der Waals' interactions. In all complexes, ring A of the chromophore is stabilized by the interaction of the hydroxyl oxygen atom O-9 with atoms N-2 and N-3 of the neighbouring base G2. The interaction between O-9 and N-3 has been found to be necessary for the in vivo antitumour activity of daunomycin (Henry, 1979). In all of the complexes analysed, the distance from O-9 to N-3 is shorter than to N-2. In the four *G*-daun complexes, a water molecule is bonded to CA the carbonyl oxygen atom O-13. This water further co-ordinates, in all cases except that of TGA-daun, to atom O-2 of base Tl or Cl. Ring D of the drug chromophore is stabilized by a sodium- or water-
