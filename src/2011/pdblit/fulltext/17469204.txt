ABSTRACT The crystal structure of a conserved leucine rich protein, YlaN, from Staphylococcus aureus has been determined by X-ray crystallogra° phy to 2.3 A resolution. Whilst the precise function of S. aureus YlaN is unknown its homologue in B. subtilis has been shown to be essential for cell survival and is thought to be involved in controlling cell shape. The structure of S. aureus YlaN provides the first view of its protein family, which reveals that it is a novel homodimer whose subunit architecture is comprised of an antiparallel 3 helix bundle reminiscent of the helical arrangements seen in leucine zipper proteins. Analysis of the pattern of sequence conservation on the structure has led to the identification of two connected solvent exposed patches of conserved residues in each subunit located at one end of but on opposite faces of the molecule. We suggest that YlaN has a binding role in the cell rather than a catalytic function and a search for its ligand is underway to accelerate its exploitation as a target for antibiotic discovery.

INTRODUCTION The current rise in antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern and has highlighted the need for the development of novel antibiotics.1 As a contribution to the rational design of such therapeutic agents, we have been engaged in the structural analysis of the protein products derived from the set of essential genes from B. subtilis2 to provide a tool kit for the discovery of such agents. In Bacillus subtilis, ylaN encodes an open reading frame for a hypothetical protein of 93 residues that has been reported to be essential for the survival of this microorganism.2 In Staphylococcus aureus, the YlaN homologue has 57% sequence identity to the B. subtilis protein and is encoded by the gene SA0961 whose protein product is a polypeptide comprised of 91 residues (hereinafter referred to as YlaN). Like its counterpart in B. subtilis, S. aureus YlaN, is particularly rich in leucine (18.7%) and lysine (11%), almost twice amount of the average composition of the

entire entries in the ExPaSy data base. Over-expression of S. aureus YlaN in E. coli has enabled the protein to be purified, and gel filtration analysis shows that it runs with an approximate molecular mass of 20 kDa suggesting that the protein is a dimer in solution.3 Currently the precise function of S. aureus YlaN is unknown. In the genome of both B. subtilis and S. aureus ylaN is located upstream from ftsW, an essential gene in B. subtilis whose protein product is involved in cell division.2 However the intergenic distance between ylaN and ftsW (about 400 bp) suggests that they are probably not part of the same operon.4 Recently, the essentiality of ylaN in B. subtilis has been independently confirmed through the use of in-frame deletions, and the depletion of the protein through a constructed strain where expression of ylaN is under the control of a xylose dependent Pxyl promoter.5 These results have revealed a phenotype in which cells having lower levels of YlaN are shorter and have a nonuniform cell width being wider at one pole than at the other (Fig. 1). This has led to the suggestion that YlaN is involved either in the control of cell growth or in cell wall biosynthesis.5 Unlike the proteins of the MreB/C/D family, whose depletion causes anomalies in cell shape, which can be restored by the addition of magnesium,6,7 the effects of YlaN depletion can not be reversed in the same way.5 This suggests that YlaN exerts its affects through a different pathway. A BLAST search with the sequence of S. aureus YlaN against the NCBI database identified 19 sequences from a range of closely related Gram-positive bacteria that belong to the Firmicutes division, which comprise a cluster of low G þ C content Gram positive microbes. These sequences could be aligned along their entire length and overall 15 residues are identical with a further 23 being very strongly conserved (defined as identical in at least 16 of 19 sequences, Fig. 2). As a contribution towards understanding the function of YlaN, in this article, we report the determination of its structure by X-ray crystallography to

° 2.3 A resolution and an analysis of the characteristics of this protein. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Crystallization and Data Collection Selenomethionine incorporated YlaN was prepared, crystallized, and data collected as previously described.3 ° The structure was refined to 2.3 A using data set collected at station 14.1 at the CCLRC SRS Daresbury synchrotron. Structure Determination and Refinement The structure of YlaN was solved by selenium MAD. The MAD data were analysed using SHELXC10 in the HKL2MAP package.11 Five out of six expected selenium atoms were located and their positions refined by using the programme SOLVE.12 The 6th selenium site was identified by residual map generated by SHARP13 using 3-

wavelength-scaled data. Preliminary phase calculations in SOLVE were followed by 2-fold NCS averaging and solvent flattening using DM.14 An initial C-alpha model was built with TURBO-FRODO.15 Further tracing and rebuilding was performed using COOT.16 The structure was refined using Refmac_5.217 in CCP4 package18 and monitored using a random 5% of the data for cross-validation. Rebuilding was carried out using rA-weighted (2Fo­Fc) and (Fo­Fc) Fourier maps. The analysis of solvent accessible surface area was calculated by AreaIMol19 ° and all figures quoted to approximately 50 A2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Quality of the Model The YlaN structure [Fig. 3(A,B)] was initially solved by ° selenium MAD techniques to 2.4 A resolution and was ° subsequently refined against data to 2.3 A resolution. Overall 162 out of the expected total of 180 residues of the YlaN dimer are well-defined in the electron density map (subunit A: 79 residues and subunit B: 83 residues). Each subunit of YlaN is organized into a bundle of three helices and the missing residues in the model lie at the N-terminus (four and three residues absent, respectively), in the a1-a2 loop (four and five residues absent, respectively) and at the C-terminus of subunit A (four residues). Conventional protein sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of the missing residues in the purified protein and the absence of the N-terminal methionine.3 At the early stage of the refinement of the structure, the difference electron density map revealed an additional feature with a peak height of 6r in each subunit [Fig. 3(D)] lying in a shallow pocket adjacent to the dimer interface where it is flanked by two identical residues, Ile22 and Gly51, and a further five strongly conserved residues (Asp18, Ala19, Gln48, Leu52, and Glu55). The analysis of the protein electrospray mass spectrometry and conventional sequencing suggest that this is not part of any

chemical modification of any of the protein's side chains. ICP mass spectrometry failed to reveal any metal associated with the purified protein further suggesting that the density is not an assigned metal atom. This is also consistent with the shape of the electron density and the relatively low peak height in the difference map (e.g., a missing selenium atom from a selenomethionine residue gave a 14d peak in the difference map as a control refinement). Overall these data suggest that the peak corresponds to a small molecule composed of light atoms bound at this site. However, given the ambiguity in the identity of the ligand, it has not been included in the final model. The structure has been refined to a crystallographic Rfactor of 22.4% (Rfree ¼ 28.3%) with average Bfactors for ° main chain and side chain atoms of 55 and 65 A2, respectively and with the Bfactors for the residues flanking the disordered regions being significantly higher. All residues in the structure of YlaN lie in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot and the refinement statistics are given in Table I. Overall Structure The overall fold of the YlaN subunit compromises a bundle of three helices with an antiparallel topology. The

sequence of YlaN is rich in leucines (17 residues in total) with these being distributed uniformly along the length of the polypeptide chains. Analysis of the structure shows that these residues play a critical role in the formation of the helical bundle with seven leucines lying in the centre of the triple helix cluster [Fig. 4(A)]. Two leucines, Leu62, and Leu64 are located at the C-terminal end of a2 and interact with their symmetry related partners across the dimer interface and Leu35 is part of the disordered a1­a2 loop in both subunits. Elsewhere seven leucines are exposed to solvent (Leu12, Leu25, Leu30, Leu33, Leu35, Leu40, and Leu90). The three helices of YlaN cross each other with crossing angles of 108, 08, and 28 for a1 and a2, a2 and a3, and a1 and a3, respectively, corresponding to a classical 3­4 helical packing, with the ridges and grooves for one helix surface formed by the side chains of residues i Æ 4n packing into the j Æ 3n ridges and grooves of the other helix.21 The two subunits in the asymmetric unit of the crystal interact along the length of a2 about a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis to create a dimer of approximate ° dimensions 50 3 40 3 35 A. The non-crystallographic 2fold lies at approximately 108 to the crystallographic y axis and is aligned approximately along the direction of the

helices in the subunit. Analysis of the solvent accessible ° surface of subunit A of YlaN reveals that 250 A2 is buried by interactions across the dimer interface. This represents approximately 14% of the total solvent accessible surface a value that lies within the range (6.5%­29.4%) observed for other dimeric proteins.22 Contacts between the two subunits are dominated by interactions either between hydrophobic residues or between the hydrophobic components of polar residues from a2 and its symmetry related mate. These two helices cross each other at an angle of À458, corresponding to a classical 4­4 helical packing, in which both helices use Æ4n ridges and grooves.21 Analysis of the Pattern of Sequence Conservation Analysis of the pattern of sequence conservation across YlaN and 18 species variants identified 15 residues are identical. With the exception of Leu33, which is located adjacent to the disordered loop between a1 and a2 in subunit A and absent in subunit B, all of these residues lie in the helical regions [Fig. 4(B)]. Overall eight identical residues (Leu25, Asn29, Leu33, Cys38, Glu42, Asp46, Thr47, and Glu78) are exposed to solvent (defined as having more than 10% of their overall surface accessible to solvent). All of these appear to cluster around two connected patches located at one end of the molecule which starts at a shallow groove on one face of each subunit, passes across the a1­a2 loop before continuing down the opposite face of the molecule to form a ridge [Figs. 3(C) and 4(B)]. Of the set of 23 strongly conserved residues [Fig 4(C)], seven contribute to these two patches of identical residues to form a continuous surface. Analysis of the region around the ridge shows that it includes a number of
PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

exposed negatively charged residues (Glu42, Asp46, and Glu78) whereas in the region of the shallow groove, the identical residues have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. Preliminary attempts to localize YlaN within B. subtilis have utilized fusions to GFP of YlaN at both the N- and Ctermini. Complementation of a ylaN deletion strain of B. subtilis was possible with an N-terminal GFP fusion revealing one bright focus per cell. In contrast, experiments using the C-terminal fusion suggest that this protein is inactive.5 This is consistent with the location of the identical and strongly conserved residues on S. aureus YlaN as a fusion at the C-terminus might be expected to block or restrict the access to these conserved residues, which lie close to this part of the molecule. In contrast, the N-terminus lies at the opposite, nonconserved end of the molecule where the effects of the fusion might be more readily tolerated. The remaining seven identical residues in YlaN structure have almost 100% of their surface buried with five of these (Leu15, Ile22, Gly70, Leu77, and Leu84) being involved in the formation of the hydrophobic core of a single subunit. Ala59 and Gly51 are involved in the formation of the dimer interface with the latter packing against its symmetry related partner. One solvent exposed identical residue, Thr47, also packs against its symmetry related mate at the dimer interface. Of the 22 residues belonging to a single subunit involved in forming the dimer, four are identical and nine are strongly conserved. The high proportion of conserved residues suggests that the 2-fold seen in the crystal structure is the same as that in solution and that the dimer may well be of biological importance to the function of the protein.

The pocket containing the unidentified ligand lies at one end of shallow groove. Analysis of the potential energy surface of the protein rendered with GRASP23 [Fig. 3(D)] reveals that a part of this pocket has a region of overall negative charge flanked by two small regions of positive charge. In contrast, the overall electrostatic surface of YlaN is featureless. However, none of the charged residues in this pocket are identical although Asp18 and Glu55 are strongly conserved. Structure Comparison A structure comparison of the YlaN monomer against all the structures deposited in the June 2006 release of the DALI database24 revealed 18 hits that include all three helices of a single subunit with a z score higher than 7.9. These correspond to proteins with a sequence identity no higher than 17%. No dimers related to YlaN were detected. All the related structures are based on a bundle of antiparallel helices arranged in either a coiled-coil fold ° with the best match being the chain B of 1HX1 with 2.3 A RMSD or where the helical bundle was part of a larger structure containing a coiled-coil domain with the best ° match being 1EK8 with 2.2 A RMSD. 1EK8 is the coiledcoil domain of the E. coli ribosome recycling factor that is suggested to be a tRNA mimic and bind to the ribosomal A-site25 whilst chain B of 1HX1 belongs to the human Bag-family molecular chaperone regulator-126 Despite the sequence similarity between YlaN and each of these proteins being 15% and 17%, respectively, these identities neither cluster with the conserved residues in YlaN nor do they include residues that have been identified as being functionally important in either 1HX1 or 1EK8. Relationship Between Sequence and Structure in YlaN YlaN contains 18% of leucines which is similar to the leucine content seen in many leucine zippers.27 Not surprisingly therefore, the structure of the pairs of helices that are frequently found in such leucine zippers overlap well with a1 and a3. Recent studies on the GCN4 leucine zipper, the yeast transcriptional activator, have revealed that the normally dimeric assembly of this protein can be perturbed to either a trimer or a tetramer by mutagenesis of one or more buried residues,28 revealing the sensitivity of the helical packing to the nature of side chains of protein in the hydrophobic core of the helical bundle. Interestingly, the arrangement of the three helices in YlaN is very similar to that seen in the trimer of the N16A mutant of ° GCN4 with a 2.1 A RMSD. Search for 3D Side Chain Motifs in YlaN A comparison of the YlaN structure against databases containing active sites and catalytic residues of the known 3D structures (CSA, Catalytic Site Atlas29 and RIGOR30) was undertaken in a search to identify similar constellations of residues or potential motifs in YlaN. Only one posPROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

sible hit was revealed using the alpha and beta carbon templates in the CSA corresponding to an overlap of a constellation of three acidic residues and one histidine in YlaN with an equivalent cluster in endopolygalacturonase I (PDB: 1NHC). However, the structure of 1NHC is completely different, and moreover only one residue out of these four residues in YlaN is conserved. Therefore, we attach no significance to this similarity. CONCLUSION The strong evidence for essentiality of YlaN in B. subtilis with its involvement in controlling cell shape and its identification in a range of gram positive pathogens including Staphylococcus, B. cereus, E. faecium, L. sakei and L. monocytoyenes suggests that this protein may be a potential target for the development of a narrow spectrum antibiotic. The high-resolution structure of YlaN provides the first view of this protein family revealing it to be based on a dimeric arrangement of subunit composed of a cluster of helices strongly resembling a leucine-zipper-like fold. Thus far, the leucine zipper motif has been only found to mediate protein­protein interactions, and no catalytic function has yet been assigned to this type of motif. Although this cannot be taken as definite evidence that YlaN does not have a catalytic role in the cell, it would suggest that the function of YlaN is more likely to be associated with binding a ligand whose identity is yet to be discovered rather than catalysis. The observation that YlaN contains an elongated shallow groove running across the two faces of each subunit that contains the majority of the surface exposed conserved residues is further suggestive of a binding function. Despite the precise function of YlaN being unknown, the availability of its structure and the identification of a conserved ligand binding site raises the intriguing possibility that it could be exploited as a target for drug discovery using multiple technologies that have been designed to identify potential inhibitors of a protein without knowledge of its activity. The small size of YlaN make it an ideal candidate for drug screening by NMR31 and equally affinity capillary electrophoresis32 could be applied in an attempt to discover potential compound that might inhibit YlaN and therefore act as lead compounds in the development of a novel antibiotic. The structure of S. aureus YlaN has been submitted to the Protein Data Bank, the RCSB ID is rcsb041002 and the PDB ID is 2ODM. REFERENCES
