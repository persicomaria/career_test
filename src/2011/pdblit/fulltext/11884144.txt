The crystal structure of endoglucanase CelA, a family 8 glycosyl hydrolase from Clostridium thermocellum
Pedro M Alzari*, Hélène Souchon and Roberto Dominguez
Background: Cellulases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in cellulose, can be classified into several different protein families. Endoglucanase CelA is a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 8, a family for which no structural information was previously available. Results: The crystal structure of CelA was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement and refined to 1.65 Å resolution. The protein folds into a regular ( / )6 barrel formed by six inner and six outer helices. Cello-oligosaccharides bind to an acidic cleft containing at least five D-glucosyl-binding subsites (A­E) such that the scissile glycosidic linkage lies between subsites C and D. The strictly conserved residue Glu95, which occupies the center of the substratebinding cleft and is hydrogen bonded to the glycosidic oxygen, has been assigned the catalytic role of proton donor. Conclusions: The present analysis provides a basis for modeling homologous family 8 cellulases. The architecture of the active-site cleft, presenting at least five glucosyl-binding subsites, explains why family 8 cellulases cleave cellooligosaccharide polymers that are at least five D-glucosyl subunits long. Furthermore, the structure of CelA allows comparison with ( / )6 barrel glycosidases that are not related in sequence, suggesting a possible, albeit distant, evolutionary relationship between different families of glycosyl hydrolases.

Introduction
Cellulolytic microorganisms produce a wide range of enzymes that hydrolyze the glycosidic bond of cellulose [1,2]. Despite the chemical regularity of the cellulose substrate (linear chains of -1,4-linked D-glucosyl residues), the catalytic domains of cellulases vary widely, belonging to at least 11 distinct protein families [3,4]. Cellulases differ in protein architecture, endo/exo specificity, and inverting/retaining reaction mechanism, but all hydrolyze the glycosidic linkage via general acid catalysis. They therefore require two critical residues, a proton donor and a nucleophile or general base [5]. The three-dimensional (3D) structures of several cellulases have been determined by X-ray crystallography. Family 5 endoglucanases CelC, from Clostridium thermocellum [6] and CelCCA, from Clostridium cellulolyticum [7], are regular ( / )8 proteins, or TIM barrels, whereas cellobiohydrolase CBHII (an exoglucanase) from Trichoderma reesei [8] and endoglucanase E2 from Thermomonospora fusca [9] (both from family 6) fold into a related, albeit more irregular, / barrel structure. Other cellulases have entirely different structures: the catalytic domain of cellobiohydrolase CBHI from T. reesei (family 7) is arranged in two antiparallel sheets, with the topology of plant lectins [10]; endoglucanase CelD from C. thermocellum (family 9) folds into a helical barrel tightly bound to an immunoglobulin-like

domain [11]; and endoglucanase V from Humicola insolens (family 45) is a small six-stranded barrel protein [12]. We report here a crystallographic study of family 8 endoglucanase CelA, which shows no sequence similarity to other cellulases with known structures. CelA was one of the first cellulases to be purified from the culture supernatant of the thermophilic anaerobe C. thermocellum [13]. This bacterium secretes an extracellular multiprotein complex, the cellulosome (Mw>2 MDa), that is very efficient in degrading crystalline cellulose (recently reviewed in [2]). The cellulosome contains several enzymes with distinct carbohydrate specificities, as well as various non-catalytic components [2,14,15]. Most cellulosomal enzymes share a highly conserved `dockerin' domain of about 70 amino acid residues that anchors the individual polypeptides to a scaffolding protein devoid of catalytic activity [16], thus providing a modular mechanism of macromolecular assembly. The CelA gene (CelA) was characterized [17,18] and found to encode a polypeptide of 488 amino acid residues, consisting of a signal-peptide-like segment, a catalytic domain, and a C-terminal dockerin domain. CelA hydrolyzes carboxymethylcellulose and, to a lesser extent, lichenan, a -glucan containing -1,4 and -1,3 linkages, but shows very low or no activity for Avicel (crystalline cellulose) or

xylan. In order to elucidate the folding topology and reaction mechanism of family 8 cellulases, we describe here the 3D structure of the catalytic domain of CelA in both its free and substrate-bound forms.

Results and discussion
The structure of the catalytic core of endoglucanase CelA and of its complexes with the inhibitor o-iodobenzyl-1thio- -cellobioside (IBTC) and various cello-oligosaccharides have been determined using multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) techniques and refined to crystallographic R-factors of 14.9­16.2% (Table 1). The atomic model of the catalytic domain contains 363 amino acid residues and has good overall stereochemistry. The electron density is continuous for the entire polypeptide backbone, with most amino acid side chains showing well-defined density (Fig. 1).

Asp156 and Arg285. This salt bridge occurs within the central hydrophobic core, adjacent to the catalytic center, and may be important for stability of the active-site architecture. No metal-binding sites were observed within the catalytic core of CelA, although a few water molecules occupy internal positions and display low temperaturefactor values. The N- and C-terminal residues of the ( / )6 barrel are in close proximity to each other and on the opposite side of the structure to the active site (Fig. 2a). In agreement with functional studies of other C. thermocellum cellulases [19], the structure of CelA suggests that the dockerin domain (which is separated by a short linker from the catalytic subunit and serves to anchor CelA to the cellulosome) folds as a separate domain, independent of the catalytic core, and plays no role in substrate binding or enzyme activity. The interdomain flexibility of cellulosomal enzymes does not exist in most other macromolecular complexes, such as the pyruvate kinase complex or the ribosome, in which specific protein­protein interactions determine a functionally critical quaternary structure. Therefore these results may indicate that the bacterial cellulosome provides a structural mechanism to increase the synergistic action of carbohydrases by assembling them into flexible multiprotein aggregates [2,14,15].
Protein­substrate interactions

Overall structure

The catalytic domain of endoglucanase CelA folds into an ( / )6 barrel consisting of six internal, mutually parallel, helices interconnected by six external helices (Fig. 2). The globular core has an overall spherical form which is about 50 Å in diameter with a long acidic cleft running across the molecular surface at the N-terminal end of the central helices. The ( / )6 barrel has a circular crosssection, with the central volume between the inner helices largely occupied by aliphatic (Val93, Leu102, Ala150, Ala153, Leu159, Ala160, Ala217, Val223, Val288, Ala342, Leu376 and Leu379) and aromatic (Tyr99, Phe163, Trp220, Trp284, Trp292, Tyr383 and Phe388) side chains. CelA contains five cysteine residues, none of which are involved in disulfide bridges. Most ionic interactions between charged groups (Table 2) are partially or totally hydrated at the molecular surface, with the single exception of a salt bridge between the internal residues

The structures of CelA complexed with IBTC and various cello-oligosaccharides define at least five D-glucosylbinding subsites within the acidic cleft (denoted A to E

from the non-reducing end of the substrate). The cellobioside moiety of IBTC occupies subsites D and E, whereas two cellobiose molecules bind, such that one occupies subsites A­B and the other binds to D­E, in the CelA­cellobiose complex structure (Fig. 3). Glucose also binds to the same four subsites, indicating that each of these individual subsites has high substrate affinity. Although the center of the binding cleft (subsite C) is not occupied by substrate in complexed CelA, the distance between the sugar atoms O1 from subsite B and O4 from subsite D (5.6 Å) is compatible with the separation required to position an intermediate glucopyranoside ring in the chair conformation. The presence of five D-glucosyl-binding subsites accounts for the cellodextrinase activity of CelA, which hydrolyzes cellopentaose and longer cello-oligosaccharides but shows very low activity for cellotriose and cellotetraose [13].

Beyond subsite E, the molecular surface of CelA forms a pocket that could accommodate an additional sugar residue. Although not occupied by substrate in the complexes of CelA with cello-oligosaccharides, this pocket binds the aromatic iodobenzyl group of the inhibitor in the CelA­IBTC structure and could form a low-affinity glucosyl-binding subsite F. The active-site cleft of CelA conforms to the typical configuration for sugar-binding sites of proteins [20], with aromatic residues stacking against the hydrophobic faces of sugar rings and hydrogen bonds conferring binding affinity and specificity. The four glucopyranose rings make stacking interactions with aromatic residues that are conserved in family 8 cellulases: Trp205 in subsite A, Trp132 in subsite B, Tyr372 in subsite D, and Tyr277 in subsite E (Fig. 4a). In addition, Tyr369 can make van der Waals

from the structure of the CelA­cellobiose complex (Fig. 3a), the linear cellulose chains emerging from both ends of the active-site cleft form an angle of approximately 110°. Chain bending probably occurs at the glycosidic linkage between subsites C and D (which is the presumed scissile bond), and can be accounted for by disruption of the alternative orientation that adjacent glucosyl rings present in a linear cellulose chain (Fig. 5a). The intermediate glucosyl residue at subsite C can be positioned by linearly extending the cellulose chain from the non-reducing end of the substrate. The model that results suggests that the sugar rings on both sides of the glycosidic linkage (subsites C­D) are similarly oriented, thus promoting the observed chain bending (Fig. 5b). Preliminary modeling of bound substrate at subsite C (Fig. 6) was carried out assuming a rigid polypeptide backbone, preserving both the position of glucosyl rings observed in the electron density (subsites A­B and D­E) and hydrogen bonds involving protein atoms. Under these constraints, in order to position the sugar ring within the binding cleft steric clashes with protein atoms were unavoidable, suggesting that local strain in the substrate (either bending or torsion) could explain the lack of glucosyl binding to subsite C in the crystal structures. It is tempting to speculate that both overall chain bending and local steric strain within the active-site cleft could help to stabilize the transition state of the substrate with respect to the ground state. However, further experimental evidence is required to validate this hypothesis, as well as to determine the actual nature of structural changes induced in both protein and substrate upon formation of the complex.

contacts with substrate bound at subsite F, as it does with the inhibitor. The hydroxyl groups of glucosyl residues participate in several hydrogen-bonding interactions with protein and water atoms (Fig. 4b). Direct protein­carbohydrate hydrogen bonds occur at the non-reducing end of the substrate. They include the interaction of hydroxyl OH-2 at subsite A with the main-chain carbonyl group of Gly145, and a bifurcated hydrogen bond of hydroxyl OH-6 at subsite B with the indole ring of Trp205 and the main-chain carbonyl of Ala149. On the other side of the cleft, the glucopyranoside ring at subsite D is within hydrogen-bonding distance of three amino acid side chains (Glu95, Arg84, and Asp278; see Fig. 4b). In addition to these direct contacts, several water molecules mediate protein­carbohydrate interactions through an extensive network of hydrogen bonds.
Substrate conformation

Substrate binding promotes no significant conformational rearrangements in the active-site architecture of CelA; the overall root mean square (rms) deviation between the uncomplexed and complexed forms of the catalytic domain is 0.2 Å. In contrast, the cellulose chain is clearly bent within the enzyme cleft upon binding. As estimated

Family 8 endoglucanase CelCCC from C. cellulolyticum, which has 55% sequence identity with CelA, hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond via a single displacement mechanism with inversion of the anomeric configuration [21]. The catalytic residues necessary for an inverting reaction are apparent in the CelA structure. Three carboxylate groups at the N-terminal end of inner helices 2, 4, and 8 (Glu95, Asp152 and Asp278, respectively) are exposed to solvent at the center of the substrate-binding cleft, close to the -1,4-linkage between subsites C and D (Fig. 6). Both Glu95 and Asp278 form hydrogen bonds to hydroxyl groups of the glucosyl unit bound at subsite D, whereas the carboxyl group of Asp152 occupies the bottom of the cleft at subsite C and is not involved in direct interactions with substrate. The proximity of Glu95, a residue strictly conserved in family 8 cellulases, to the glycosidic oxygen between subsites C and D suggests that the glutamate side chain may act as a general acid catalyst or proton donor. One carboxyl oxygen atom of Glu95 forms hydrogen bonds with the OH-4 atom of the glucosyl residue at subsite D (equivalent to the -1,4-linking

oxygen) and with the buried -guanido group of Arg281 (Fig. 6). The other carboxyl oxygen of Glu95 forms hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl group of Tyr371 and to the OH-3 atom of the same glucosyl residue. The two residues contacting the catalytic glutamate (Arg281 and Tyr371) are also conserved in family 8 cellulases, suggesting that these hydrogen-bonding interactions play an important role in determining the protonation state of the carboxyl group.

The acidic residues Asp152 and Asp278 are positioned at a similar distance from the scissile bond, although the corresponding side chains approach the substrate in different orientations (Fig. 6). In the CelA­cellobiose complex structure, the side chain of Asp152 (at the bottom of the cleft) interacts with four water molecules and forms a weak hydrogen bond with Arg281 (Table 2), whereas the carboxyl group of Asp278 (on one side of the binding cleft) makes hydrogen bonds with the OH-6 group of the

glucosyl residue at subsite D, the amide group of Asn212, and two water molecules. Both aspartyl residues are favorably positioned to serve as the general base catalyst in the hydrolytic reaction. Sequence comparison of family 8 cellulases suggests that Asp152 is the second catalytic residue because this position is strictly conserved within the family, whereas position 278 is occupied by asparagine in two Bacillus sp. endoglucanases [21,22]. Furthermore, sitedirected mutagenesis studies of the Bacillus sp. KSM-330 cellulase demonstrated that substitution of Asp191 (equivalent to Asp152 in CelA) by an isosteric asparagine residue strongly decreased the specific activity of the enzyme

towards carboxymethylcellulose [22]. Modeling studies of enzyme-bound substrate also seem to support this hypothesis. According to the model (Fig. 6), the anomeric center of the glucosyl residue at subsite C faces a water molecule that would be favorably positioned to serve as the nucleophile in the inverting mechanism. This water is within hydrogen-bonding distance (2.8 Å) of Asp152 and is clearly visible in electron-density maps of both uncomplexed and complexed CelA, with a temperature-factor value of 18 Å2. However, it should be noted that rotation of the modeled sugar ring about the axis of the chain would bring the hydroxyl groups OH-2 and OH-3 to

structural evidence of the conformation of the glucosyl residue at subsite C. It was previously noted [5] that the average separation between the catalytic carboxylates of - and -glycosidases was significantly different for retaining (4.8­5.3 Å) and inverting (9.0­9.5 Å) enzymes; the greater distance in inverting enzymes is presumably required to accommodate the nucleophilic water between the two carboxylates. Endoglucanase CelA appears to deviate from this pattern, as the average separation between the carboxyl groups of Glu95 and Asp152 is 5.8 Å (7.5 Å between Glu95 and Asp278), a value significantly lower than that expected for an inverting enzyme. Indeed, retaining and inverting mechanisms impose different stereochemical constraints on the catalytic residues. In retaining enzymes the two catalytic residues must both be close to the scissile bond, thus setting an upper limit for the separation between the corresponding carboxyl groups. However, although similar distance constraints apply to the water nucleophile and the proton donor in inverting enzymes, the position of the general base is less restricted. The possible separation between the two catalytic residues can thus present a wider range of values.

Substrate conformation. (a) Alternative orientation of adjacent -1,4linked glucosyl residues promotes the formation of a linear chain in cellulose. (b) Substrate binding to CelA imposes a similar orientation to consecutive glucopyranoside rings at subsites C and D, inducing a bend of the cellulose chain when within the active-site cleft. In the conformation shown, both the anomeric carbon C1 and the glycosidic oxygen O4 (indicated with arrows) can be approached from the same side of the substrate.

within hydrogen-bonding distance of the two carboxyl oxygens of Asp152, leaving Asp278 (which approaches the glycosidic bond from the opposite side of the substrate with respect to the proton donor, Glu95) facing the anomeric carbon C1. Therefore, although the present study unambiguously identifies Glu95 as the proton donor in the catalytic mechanism, a definitive assignment of the general base catalyst (Asp152 or Asp278) requires further

Hydrogen bonds are represented by thin dashed lines. A possible orientation of the glucosyl ring at subsite C is shown in thick dashed lines. (The figure was drawn with MOLSCRIPT [38].)

In addition to CelA, the ( / )6 barrel topology has also been observed in two other glycosidases that have completely unrelated amino acid sequences: family 9 endoglucanase CelD from C. thermocellum [11] and family 15 glucoamylase-I from Aspergillus awamori [23]. These enzymes all have an acidic active-site cleft at the N-terminal end of the inner helices. They hydrolyze the glycosidic linkage via a single displacement mechanism leading to inversion of configuration at the anomeric carbon. However, structural comparisons between these three

enzymes reveal important differences. As a result of dissimilar packing of helices within the barrel, the crosssection is nearly circular in CelA and glucoamylase-I, but more elliptical in CelD (Fig. 7). The architecture and orientation of the corresponding active-site clefts also differ considerably. When the structures are superimposed with the helices in the same topological order (as shown in Fig. 7), the long substrate-binding grooves in CelA and CelD run in approximately perpendicular directions. Furthermore, glucoamylase-I has no groove, but has a central active pocket with an approximate diameter of 15 Å and a depth of 10 Å [23]. In addition, the carboxyl groups assigned as the proton donor and the general base catalysts occupy unrelated positions in both the amino acid sequence and the 3D structure. In CelA, these residues, Glu95 and Asp152 (or Asp278), at the N-terminal end of helices 2 and 4 (or 8), lie close to each other and near the middle of the cleft. The corresponding residues in CelD (Glu555 and Asp201) occur in the loops connecting helices 11 and 12 and helices 1 and 2, at the reducing end of the substrate-binding groove [11]. Those of glucoamylase-I, Glu179 (between helices 5 and 6) and Glu400 (between

helices 11 and 12), approach the substrate from opposite sides of the central binding pocket [24]. These comparisons reflect the intrinsic stability of the ( / )6 barrel as a tertiary structure motif, and suggest a possible, albeit distant, evolutionary connection between distinct classes of glycosyl hydrolases.

Biological implications
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide of the plant cell wall. In order to hydrolyze natural cellulose, cellulolytic microorganisms have evolved a wide variety of enzymes with different carbohydrate specificities and three-dimensional (3D) structures. Indeed, cellulases and hemicellulases account for over one third of all the known families of glycosidic enzymes. The thermophilic anaerobe Clostridium thermocellum, one of the most thoroughly studied cellulolytic microorganisms, produces a high molecular weight multienzyme complex, the cellulosome, which is very active against crystalline cellulose. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic core of C. thermocellum endoglucanase CelA, a cellulosomal enzyme that

belongs to glycosidase family 8, a family for which no structural information was previously available. The catalytic core of CelA folds into an ( / )6 barrel formed by six inner and six outer helices, with an acidic active-site cleft running across the molecular surface at the N-terminal end of the inner helices. The structures of CelA complexed with various cellooligosaccharides reveal five D-glucosyl binding subsites (A­E) which are lined with tryptophan and tyrosine residues that are involved in stacking interactions with the substrate. The carboxylate group of Glu95 is hydrogen bonded to the -1,4-linking oxygen between subsites C and D, and has been assigned the role of proton donor. The carboxylate groups of Asp152 or Asp278, close to the scissile glycosidic bond, are the likely candidates for the general base catalyst in the hydrolytic reaction. The protein folding pattern and active-site architecture of CelA can be extended to other members of family 8 cellulases. Furthermore, the comparison of CelA with family 9 cellulases and family 15 glucoamylases, which present a similar protein fold but different active-site architecture, reflects the stability of the ( / )6 barrel as a protein folding motif and suggests a possible evolutionary relationship between different families of glycosyl hydrolases.

DENZO and SCALEPACK [26] and other programs from the CCP4 suite [27]. A first diffraction data set was measured at 1.65 Å resolution from a single crystal of native CelA (Table 3). For heavy-atom data collection, the same crystal was soaked in 1mM HgCl2 and a data set collected to 1.9 Å resolution. Subsequently, the crystal was soaked in 5 mM trimethyl lead acetate (derivative Hg+Pb) and a data set was collected to 1.9 Å. After obtaining new crystals of CelA by macroseeding techniques, data from a second mercurial derivative were collected after soaking a fresh crystal in 0.2 mM HgCl2. This mercurial and the (Hg+Pb) derivative were used for structure determination (Table 3). In order to characterize protein­carbohydrate interactions, CelA was co-crystallized in the presence of the inhibitor IBTC and various cellooligosaccharides (glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose). Isomorphous crystals of the enzyme­ligand complexes were grown as described for uncomplexed CelA [25], using an enzyme:ligand molar ratio of 1:10 in all cases. Data collection statistics of the various CelA complexes are shown in Table 3.

Structure determination and refinement of uncomplexed CelA
Heavy-atom parameters for the Hg derivative (4 sites, phasing power for acentric reflections of 2.3, and R-Cullis of 0.48) and the (Hg+Pb) derivative (6 sites, phasing power of 2.2 and R-Cullis of 0.57) were refined at 1.9 Å resolution with the CCP4 program MLPHARE [28]. As shown in Table 4, the major heavy-atom binding sites in the (Hg+Pb) derivative were essentially occupied by Hg atoms bound to the five free cysteine residues of CelA. The initial MIR phases calculated with the program MLPHARE (figure of merit of 0.64 at 1.9 Å) were further refined using the program DM [29] from CCP4. Starting with an R-free of 53%, 50 cycles of solvent flattening (assuming a solvent content of 35%) and histogram matching refinement converged to an overall figure of merit of 0.82 and an R-free of 32% in the resolution range 10­1.9 Å. The electron-density map calculated with DM-modified MIR phases (Fig. 1) allowed unambiguous tracing of the entire polypeptide chain (363 residues from positions 33­395). Chain tracing and model building was carried out with the program `O' [30]. The model was subjected to a first round of simulated annealing refinement at 1.9 Å resolution with X-PLOR [31] using potential parameters proposed by Engh and Huber [32] and restrained individual isotropic thermal parameters ( B=1 Å2 for bonded atoms). This initial cycle reduced the crystallographic R-factor from 35% to 26%, maintaining good model stereochemistry. Subsequent refinement was carried out by successive rounds of positional and temperature factor refinement with X-PLOR followed by automatic insertion and deletion of water molecules with the program ARP [33]. All 39 653 independent reflections between

The protein crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell dimensions a=50.12 Å, b=63.52 Å, and c=104.97 Å, and with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Vm=1.94 Å3 Da­1). All diffraction intensities were collected at room temperature using a MARresearch Image Plate scanner mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator, and reduced to structure-factor amplitudes with Table 3 Data collection statistics.

*All heavy-atom sites were refined assuming Hg atomic scattering factors and a fixed B value of 30 Å2. Possible chloride atom. Binding sites 3 and 4 in the second derivative are identical to sites 2 and 3 in the first derivative.

10 Å and 1.65 Å resolution were used for refinement, 5% of which were set aside for R-free calculation [34]. A first round of 50 combined X-PLOR­ARP cycles converged to an R-factor of 15.5% (R-free=18.7%) for a model containing 401 water molecules, with rms deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles of 0.011 Å and 1.4°, respectively. After visual inspection of electron-density maps, minor modifications were introduced to the protein model, some residues with side chains they were not visible in density were converted to alanine, and 101 water molecules were removed based on stereochemical and temperature-factor criteria. A second round of combined X-PLOR­ARP refinement converged to an R-factor of 15.6% (Rfree=18.9%) for a model including 370 water molecules. At this stage, inspection of (3Fo­2Fc) electron-density maps allowed positioning of the missing side chains. The final model retained 266 water molecules with temperature-factor values B<50 Å2. The parameters after a final positional refinement round with X-PLOR are reported in Table 1.

Bound glucosyl residues are well defined in the electron-density maps calculated with experimental phases (Fig. 3), but display high temperature-factor values in the refined models of the complexes (Table 1). These values probably reflect partial substrate occupancy, since glucose (which cannot simultaneously occupy adjacent glucosylbinding subsites) presents similar high temperature factors in the refined structure of the CelA­glucose complex (data not shown). The atomic coordinates of the refined protein model (for the uncomplexed CelA) have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank [37], code 1CEM.

Quality of the model
The atomic model of CelA includes 363 amino acid residues corresponding to positions 33­395 of the CelA gene [18], and accounts for a catalytic core of 40.2 kDa, in good agreement with the molecular weight of papain-treated CelA (42 kDa) determined by SDS/PAGE [25]. The final (3Fo­2Fc) electron-density map shows continuous density for the entire polypeptide chain. Most amino acid side chains (in particular all those forming the active-site cleft) are well defined in density. The model of CelA has good overall stereochemistry (Table 1). All main-chain dihedral angles fall within allowed (90.4%) or additional allowed (9.6%) regions [35] of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 8). From the resolution dependence of the R-factor, the mean positional error of the final model coordinates is estimated to lie within 0.15­0.20 Å [36].

Refinement of CelA complexes
The initial models for IBTC and the various cello-oligosaccharides were built from Fourier difference maps calculated with observed amplitudes and MIR phases (Fig. 3). Crystallographic refinement was carried out as described above for uncomplexed CelA, assuming full occupancy of bound sugar atoms. The final refinement parameters for the CelA­IBTC and the CelA­cellobiose complexes are given in Table 1. Complexes of CelA with other cello-oligosaccharides (glucose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose) were also refined (data not shown), leading to structural models essentially identical to that of the CelA­cellobiose complex, with a glucosyl residue bound to each of the subsites A, B, D, and E.
