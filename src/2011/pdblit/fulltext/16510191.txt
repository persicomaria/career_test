Direct electrochemical transfer of electrons to the enzyme provides an excellent method of driving the catalytic reactions of cytochrome P450 enzymes that form a superfamily of vital heme enzymes involved in biological monooxygenation reactions. Covalent attachment of N-(1-pyrenyl) maleimide (pyrene maleimide) to the bacterial cytochrome P450, CYP101 has been carried out and the conjugated enzyme was shown to be specifically immobilized onto the glassy carbon electrode through the pyrene group. The electrode immobilized pyrene-conjugated enzyme showed quasi-reversible electrochemistry with a midpoint potential at À330 ± 10 mV versus Ag/AgCl. The unconjugated enzyme that did not have specific linkage with the pyrene maleimide was non-specifically adsorbed on the electrode surface and the electrochemical response was much weaker than that observed in case of the conjugated enzyme, though the midpoint potential was almost unchanged. The pyrene maleimide bound CYP101 was found to have surface coverage of 1.35 ± 0.3 Â 10À10 mol/cm2 and the heterogeneous rate of electron transfer was found to be 0.21 ± 0.02 sÀ1, which is larger than that for the unconjugated enzyme. The pyrene maleimide linked immobilized enzyme was oriented to the electrode so that efficient electron transfer takes place from the electrode to the immobilized enzyme. The oxygenase activity of the immobilized conjugated enzyme was assayed from the enhancement of catalytic current in presence of oxygen and the natural substrate camphor. Mass spectrometric studies also showed enhanced formation of hydroxycamphor by electrochemically driven catalysis in the pyrene maleimide linked immobilized CYP101. Ó 2010 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction Cytochrome P450 is a generic name given to a superfamily of heme-monooxygenases that metabolize a wide variety of natural and unnatural substances such as steroids, fatty acids, hydrocarbons, and xenobiotics. The cytochrome P450cam (CYP101, Fig. 1) from Pseudomonas putida has been extensively studied as a prototype of the P450 superfamily that utilize electrons transferred from NADH through putidaredoxin reductase via putidaredoxin to the heme monooxygenase in the Class I [1] assembly of the enzyme

complex. The crystal structure of CYP101 has been reported to a very good resolution both in presence and in absence of the substrate [2,3] enabling detailed analyses of the structure­function relationship. The enzymatic cycle of the monooxygenases [4] involves transfer of two equivalents of electrons to the heme active site. The monooxygenation reaction requires, in addition to d-camphor and molecular oxygen, two reducing equivalents, which are transferred from NADH to CYP101 through a specific electron transfer system, composed of NADH-putidaredoxin reductase (PdR), a flavoprotein, and putidaredoxin (Pdx), an iron­sulfur (Fe2S2) protein [5,6]. In the reaction, Pdx receives electrons from PdR and transfers them to CYP101; Pdx serves as the direct electron donor for CYP101 [7]. The mechanism of the first electron transfer step (ferri- to ferroheme reduction) to the enzyme has been the subject of intense interest [8,9]. Binding of the substrate, camphor was shown to cause a change in the spin state of the ferri-heme iron, from a low-spin six-coordinated form to a five-coordinated high-spin form with the camphor bound near the metal center [10]. The substrate-binding induced spin-state change causes a drastic change

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the crystal structure of WT CYP101 (ID: 1DZ4) showing the cysteine residues along with the heme and the camphor. The C136 and C58 residues are shown in CPK model. The lower panel shows a schematic representation of the enzymatic hydroxylation of camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor catalyzed by CYP101.

in the heme environment that has been characterized by UV­Vis absorption along with Mossbauer [11] and EPR [12] spectroscopic studies. In addition, it has been noted that this spin-state change upon camphor binding is accompanied by a redox potential change from À300 to À170 mV (versus NHE) [13]. This shift in the heme reduction potential is a key feature of the catalytic cycle of the enzyme, allowing the first electron transfer from putidaredoxin to occur and thus initiating catalytic turnover. The enzymatic reaction of the CYP101 requires specific binding of the enzyme to the putidaredoxin (Pdx) and the later binds to putidaredoxin reductase (PdR) that binds to NADH making the vectorial electron transport chain from NADH to PdR to Pdx to CYP101. Simple addition of reducing agents to the enzyme solution tends to reduce the protein rather than carrying out oxygenation of the substrate. In order to drive the enzymatic reaction of CYP101 by electrochemical means, we need to design an electrode system that can substitute the electron transfer chain provided by PdR and Pdx to the enzyme [14,15]. Direct electrochemistry of CYP101 on unmodified electrodes has been proven to be very difficult due to deeply buried heme cofactor and instability of the biological matrix upon interaction with the electrode surface [15­17]. Nevertheless, direct electrochemistry of CYP101 has been reported by using either a bare edge plane graphite electrode [16] or glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with lipid, polyelectrolyte or sodium montmorillonite [18] both in presence and in absence of the substrate. Electrochemically driven monooxygenation of camphor or dehalogenation of haloalkanes was earlier reported on indium­ tin oxide (ITO) electrode with polylysine as the promoter and putidaredoxin or spinach ferredoxin as the mediator of electrochemistry of CYP101 [19,20]. Similarly, the electrochemistry and catalytic behavior of P450 2E1 in surfactant [17], of P450 3A4 in polycationic [21], and of CYP2B4 in clay have been reported [22,23]. More recently, Shumyantseva and coworkers reported a mediator-free biosensor by immobilizing CYP2B4 in montmorillonite on a glassy carbon electrode [24].

It is important to note that the electron transfer pathway in the P450 enzymes follow a very specific pathway, which is critically important for the function of the enzyme. The electron entry to CYP101 takes place through a well defined patch that binds Pdx [25] in the natural system. The surface of the CYP101 near the proximal side of the heme interact with a specific surface of Pdx supporting that the electron transfer from Pdx to CYP101 takes place vectorially through the proximal side of heme [25­27]. Although there have been several studies on electrochemistry of CYP101, there has not been any report attempting to achieve electrochemically driven vectorial electron transfer to the enzyme through a specific surface patch of CYP101 as observed in case of its natural partner. Earlier studies on direct electrochemical studies of CYP101 possibly correspond to a random orientation of the enzyme on the electrode surface during the electron transfer from the electrode to the enzyme. Immobilization of the enzyme through a pyrene maleimide linker has been shown to give enhanced electron transfer efficiency in case of the cytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102) when the linker is attached to the enzyme through a residue at the surface near the proximal side of the heme active site of the enzyme [28]. In order to achieve an efficient electron transfer from the electrode to the enzyme specifically through a surface patch near the R79, R109 and R112 residues of CYP101 that interact with its redox partner Pdx [25­27], we propose to create a specific linker between the electrode and a residue near this patch on the surface of the enzyme. In the present work CYP101 has been specifically linked to the glassy carbon electrode to carry out electrochemistry of the oriented enzymes. The glassy carbon electrode was modified with pyrene maleimide in which pyrene being an aromatic molecule was adsorbed on the glassy carbon surface by p­p interaction [29] to form a self assembled layer on the electrode surface. The linkage of the enzyme with the pyrene maleimide takes place by addition reaction of a surface exposed ­SH group of a cysteine residue and the maleimide [28,30]. Earlier studies used this method to link cytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102) from Bacillus megaterium that shows wide substrate specificity and high electron transfer rates [28]. The surface structure of CYP101 from P. putida as well its substrate specificity are distinctly different from those of cytochrome P450BM3, though they belong to the same superfamily of enzymes. Thus the electron transfer properties of CYP101 from the electrode to the enzyme through a specific linker, such as pyrene maleimide would be different than that in case of the cytochrome P450 BM3 studied earlier [28]. The CYP101 was thus immobilized on the pyrene maleimide modified electrode and electrochemistry and electrocatalysis of the immobilized enzyme to its natural substrate, camphor was studied.

2. Experimental methods The pCHC1 plasmid containing the gene for the C334A mutant of CYP101 used in this study was a kind gift from Prof. L.L. Wong, University of Oxford. The plasmid consisting of mutation C334A was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21-DE3) and purified according to literature methods [31] to obtain the wild type CYP101 that was stored at À20 °C in 40% glycerol in presence of 1 mM camphor. The enzyme aliquots were passed through a gel filtration column to remove the glycerol and camphor (wherever necessary) before experiments. Pyrene maleimide was purchased from Sigma. About 10 ll of 10 mM pyrene maleimide solution in DMF was mixed with 200 ll of $1 lM purified CYP101 ­ kept for 5 min at 4 °C. The unreacted pyrene maleimide was removed by size-exclusion chromatography using a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25, Amersham).

UV­Vis absorption spectra of this solution were measured using Perkin­Elmer k-750 instrument. Cyclic voltammetric experiments were carried out at room temperature using Autolab potentiostat-30 instrument in a three-electrode assembly with Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode to GC as working electrode. Nitrogen gas was purged through 10 ml solution for at least 10 min to remove any dissolved oxygen before every experiment. Nitrogen atmosphere was maintained over the solutions during experiments. Prior to every experiment, suitable pre-treatment of the working electrode was carried out. Pre-treatment of GC electrode involves polishing firmly on micro- cloth using fine 0.05 lm alumina powders. It was then sonicated for 1 min in Millipore water, rinsed thoroughly with water, and used immediately. The GC electrode was dipped in 10 mM pyrene maleimide solution in DMF overnight. It was then washed by dipping in millipore water. It was then dipped in 1% TritonX-100 solution and kept for 10 min ­ washed by dipping in millipore water again. Then it was dipped in CYP101 solution overnight. The working buffer was 40 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM KCl, pH 7.4. The electrode potential values were reported with respect to the Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl). All electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature. Platinum wire was obtained from Sigma­Aldrich. GC electrode and Ag/AgCl electrodes were from CH-Instruments, USA. All CD spectral measurements were performed using a JASCO810 polarimeter. The tertiary structure of CYP101 was measured by recording the CD spectra of 20 lM enzyme in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in 250­700 nm range using quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length. The experiments were also done at room temperature unless stated otherwise. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESIMS) was used to detect the product formed by enzymatic catalysis. The control and the catalytic mixture were extracted with chloroform and the organic layer was removed carefully after centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 15 min. The chloroform extract was mixed with methanol (1:1) and injected into the ESI source of the instrument (LCQ Deca, Thermo Fisher), at a flow rate of 5 ll/min, with 0.1% TFA to promote the protonation of the organic molecules. The source voltage was kept at +4.5 kV for all experiments to create positive charged droplets which are finally detected and analyzed using a Quadruple Ion-trap mass analyzer. The source temperature was kept at 250 °C. The site of linkage of pyrene maleimide to CYP101 was determined by sequencing of the tryptic digests of the pyrene maleimide adduct of CYP101 using the ESIMS setup. The enzyme solution was desalted using a PD 10 column (Sephadex G-25, Amersham) and the solution then concentrated using centricon tube. A concentrated solution of CYP101 (50 ll) was used for the digestion. The proteolysis of the enzyme was carried out with Trypsin (proteomics grade) from Sigma, India. In order to allow full access by the proteolytic enzyme, denaturation of the CYP101 was carried out in the presence of 4 M urea containing 50% methanol and 200 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (freshly prepared in ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5) was added to prevent cross linking of the cysteine residues and to improve the sequence coverage. The solution of CYP101 was incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. to allow the reduction of disulfide bonds and then kept at 37 °C for cooling. Proteolytic digestion of CYP101 was carried out in the presence of trypsin with the ratio of trypsin to protein solution 1:50 (w/w). The optimal pH for trypsin is in the range from 7.0 to 9.0. Digestion was carried out at 37 °C overnight. To inactivate trypsin, 0.5 ll of acetic acid was added to reach pH 3. The sample was then stored at À20 °C. About 100 ll aliquot of the digestion mixture was mixed with 1 ml acetone and the peptide fragments were precipitated on cooling at À20 °C for 5 h. It was then centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for

30 min and the precipitated peptides were collected in 500 ll solution of methanol and TFA (100:1, v/v) for ESIMS analysis. The peptides formed by the digestion of CYP101 with trypsin showed distinct m/z values in the ESI-mass spectra. The sequence of the peptide was determined by tandem MS/MS analysis of the collision induced fragments of the peptides using TURBOSEQUEST software (Thermo Fisher). The peptide containing the pyrene maleimide group bound through cysteine residue could be identified by this method and the sequence specific site of linkage of pyrene maleimide to the enzyme was determined.

3. Results and discussion The pCHC1 plasmid contains the gene for C334A mutant of CYP101, which is considered as the wild type enzyme. The structure of CYP101 in presence of the substrate camphor is given in Fig. 1 which shows the heme prosthetic group, camphor and the cysteine residues in ball-stick models. The cysteine 136 and cysteine 58 are shown in larger space-filling model (data taken from PDB file 1DZ4). The C334A mutant has been shown to be identical with the native CYP101 monomer in terms of optical spectra, camphor binding and turnover activity [32] in solution. The UV­Vis spectra of the purified CYP101 in presence of the substrate camphor showed typical Soret peak at 390 nm, along with bands at 510, 540 and 646 nm (Fig. 2). This spectrum matches with the absorbance spectrum of the substrate-bound wild type enzyme characterizing high-spin five-coordinated ferric heme bound to the protein through a cysteine residue. Circular dichroism spectrum of the purified CYP101 in the farUV 190­260 nm region (data not shown) had typical double hump spectra characteristic of helical protein which on analyses showed presence of $40% a-helix content as reported earlier [31]. The circular dichroism spectrum of the enzyme in the visible region that corresponds to the absorption of the heme residue provides important information on the conformation of the heme cavity in the tertiary structure of the enzyme. Inset of Fig. 2 shows the visible CD spectrum of the substrate-bound CYP101 linked to pyrene maleimide in presence of 1 mM camphor. The visible CD spectra of the enzyme in presence of the substrate camphor showed a negative band at $400 nm region corresponding to the anisotropic environment around the heme in the active site of the enzyme.

CD spectra of the pyrene maleimide linked CYP101 matched with that of the unconjugated CYP101 reported earlier [31] supporting that conjugation of the enzyme with pyrene maleimide does not affect the tertiary structure of the active site of the enzyme in the present case. The wild type CYP101 consists of seven cysteine (with the C334 mutated to A) residues of which C357 is coordinated to the iron in the heme and resides deep inside the protein matrix (Fig. 1). The reaction of the maleimide group of the linker (pyrene maleimide) specifically takes place with the surface exposed thiol group of the cysteine. The solvent exposure analysis of the seven cysteine residues present in the wild type CYP101 was carried out by using the crystal structure of the wild type enzyme. The crystal structure of the protein was obtained from Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (http://pdbbeta.rcsb.org/pdb/), PDB-ID:1DZ4 and analyzed using the WHATIF Server software [33,34] (http:// swift.cmbi.ru.nl/servers/html/index.html). Close inspection of the crystal structures shows that Cys148, Cys242, Cys285, Cys357 (5th ligand of the heme iron) and Cys85 are completely buried into the protein matrix and have surface accessible areas of 0, 0.6, 0, 0 and 0.2 Å2 respectively. The remaining Cys58 and Cys136, shown in CPK models in Fig. 1 in the wild type enzyme have surface accessible area of about 4.7, 4.1 Å2, respectively. This result suggests that the Cys136 and Cys58 residues are the most surface exposed cysteines in the WT enzyme. The maleimide group in the linker, pyrene maleimide would thus specifically reacts with the free thiol group preferentially of these residues (C136 and/or C58) to form addition compound in aqueous buffer under ambient conditions. Reaction of pyrene maleimide with the WT CYP101 would thus lead to attachment of the maleimide to the protein through the thiol group of either of these two cysteine residues. Pyrene being a highly aromatic moiety, has been shown to bind strongly to the hydrophobic surface of the glassy carbon electrode [29,35,36] and electron transfer can easily occur through the electron transfer patch. Earlier studies on cytochrome P450BM3 showed that covalent attachment of the pyrene containing linker (pyrene iodoacetamide) to the cysteine in N387C mutant of the enzyme, indeed promote direct electrochemistry of the immobilized enzyme on BPG electrode (basal plane graphite) [29,36]. Such linkage of the enzyme to the electrode was shown to facilitate direct electron transfer and the rate of electron transfer between the electron and the enzyme was shown to be as high as 650/s [29]. The optimized reaction condition in the present case was $1:500 mol ratio of enzyme: pyrene maleimide reacted at 4 °C at pH 7.4 for 5 min followed by repeated size-exclusion chromatographic separation (by PD-10) of the unreacted maleimide from the protein solution. The stoichiometry of binding of pyrene maleimide to the enzyme was determined from the UV­Vis absorption spectra of the adduct (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows the UV­Vis. spectrum of the purified pyrene maleimide linked with CYP101. It shows the characteristic peak [37] at 345 nm (e = 4 Â 104 MÀ1 cmÀ1) along with the characteristic absorption bands of the enzyme, confirming that the pyrene maleimide is indeed attached to the protein. The concentration of pyrene in the protein was determined from fluorescence (kex = 345 nm). Alternatively, the concentration of the protein (CYP101) in the pyrene conjugate was determined by the UV­Vis absorption spectra from the absorbance of the conjugate at 420 nm using e420 (CYP101) = 51.47 mMÀ1 cmÀ1 as there was no absorption of the pyrene maleimide at this wavelength. The concentration of pyrene in the conjugate was determined from the difference in absorbance of the pyrene conjugate to that of the CYP101 at 345 nm (using e345 (CYP101) as 46.58 mMÀ1 cmÀ1). The analyses of the results in Fig. 3 showed that the mole ratio of pyrene to CYP101 was 1:1.3 in the pyrene conjugate of CYP101. The integrity of the pyrene-conjugated CYP101 was confirmed by observing the Soret band of the reduced heme at

The visible CD spectrum of the pyrene maleimide conjugate was identical to that of the unconjugated protein confirming that conjugation of the pyrene maleimide did not affect the tertiary structure of the heme active site (inset Fig. 2). In order to determine whether the pyrene maleimide is indeed bound to the cysteines 136 or cysteine 58 residue of the enzyme, we carried out tandem MS/MS analyses of the tryptic digests of the pyrene-conjugated enzyme. The complete tryptic digestion of the enzyme cleaves at K and R sites to produce 34 peptide fragments. Proteolysis of the pyrene maleimide conjugate was found to give a unique peptide at m/z 705.2 (data not shown) and at m/ z 1932.67 (Fig. 4) corresponding to charge-state of 2 of the apparent peptide mass of 1411 and 3866 Da, respectively that were absent in the mass spectrum of the tryptic digest of the WT enzyme.

The MS/MS analyses of these peptides were used to determine their sequence. The CID fragmentation pattern of the peptide showing m/z 1932.67 is shown in Fig. 4, which corresponds to the sequence IQELAC*SLIESLRPQGQCNFTEDYAEPFPIR (where C* refers to cysteine attached to pyrene maleimide). This peptide sequence corresponds to the tryptic peptide of the enzyme from sequence 131 to 161 with the cysteine residue at position 136 modified by pyrene maleimide. Analogously, MS/MS analyses of the peptide with m/z 705.2 gave the sequence C*NGGHWIATR (where C* refers to cysteine attached to pyrene maleimide). This sequence corresponds to the tryptic peptide of the enzyme from sequence 58 to 67 with the cysteine residue at position 58 modified by pyrene maleimide. The mass spectral results thus confirm that the pyrene maleimide was indeed associated with the enzyme. As the spectroscopic analyses (Fig. 3) confirm that there was only one pyrene molecule attached to one molecule of CYP101, the conjugation of the pyrene maleimide to the enzyme might be taking place either at C136 or at C58 positions (both of them have almost equal surface exposure). Thus, the sample might consist of a mixture of pyrene maleimide conjugated CYP101 linked through C136 or through C58. Earlier studies on electrochemistry of CYP101 involved nonspecific interaction of the electrode with the enzyme either in the solution on in a thin film on the electrode [15­17]. The protein in solution would diffuse to the electrode and the relative orientation of the enzyme on the electrode surface during the electron transfer from the electrode could be random in nature. The non-specific adsorption of the enzyme in the form of thin film would also lead to a random orientation of the enzyme on the electrode surface. In the present case, covalent linkage of the thiol group of the CYP101 with maleimide forms a conjugate of the pyrene to the protein. Pyrene would specifically adsorb on the electrode surface [36] and thus this could enable binding of the enzyme at a specific orientation on the electrode surface. A schematic representation of the association of the pyrene conjugate of the CYP101 at the electrode surface is shown in Fig. 5. The immobilization of the pyrene-conjugated enzyme on the glassy carbon was made by first immobilizing the pyrene maleimide on the electrode, removing the unbound pyrene maleimide and then attaching the protein to the electrode bound pyrene maleimide molecules and finally removing the unbound enzyme by gentle washing of the electrode by buffer. This method ensured that only one pyrene maleimide could be associated to the enzyme and the immobilization of the enzyme takes place solely through the association of the electrode bound pyrene

The cyclic voltammogram of WT CYP101 covalently linked with pyrene maleimide (Fig. 6) in 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 shows a midpoint potential of À330 ± 10 mV (versus Ag/ AgCl) in presence of 1 mM camphor, which is in reasonable agreement with the earlier potentiometrically determined value of À170 mV (versus NHE) [13]. The peaks correspond to the oneelectron redox process of the iron in the heme corresponding to P­FeII/P­FeIII conversion (P is the protein). The inset of the Fig. 6 shows the square-wave (SW) voltammogram of the enzyme showing the peak maximum at the midpoint potential for the redox couple. In order to determine whether the pyrene-conjugated enzyme was indeed immobilized on the electrode surface, we carried out cyclic voltammetric studies of the sample at different scan rates. The peak currents were found to be linearly dependent with the scan rate (Fig. 7) in the cyclic voltammetric experiments, indicating that the enzyme was indeed adsorbed on the electrode surface. The peak current for a surface confined reactant is given by [38],

The ratio of the slopes of the plots was analyzed to estimate the average value of a as 0.56. The rate of heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and the pyrene-conjugated CYP101 was determined by Laviron's method from the following equation at different scan rates:

where, n = number of electron transferred, F = Faraday's constant, R = universal gas constant, T = absolute temperature in Kelvin (T = 298 K), A = surface area of the electrode, C = surface coverage or the concentration of the redox active adsorbed in mol/cm2, m = scan rate. The plot of peak currents versus scan rate shown in Fig. 7 was fitted to the Eq. (1). The slopes of the plots were given by (n2F2/ 4RT)AC and using the known geometric area of the electrode surface (A = 0.071 cm2) and the other constants, the estimated values of the number of molecules of the enzyme associated with the electrode surface (C) were found to be, 1.65 Â 10À10 mol/cm2 and 1.06 Â 10À10 mol/cm2, respectively for the cathodic and anodic peaks. Thus the results suggest that there were 1.35 ± 0.3 Â 10À10 mol/cm2 of the enzyme immobilized on the electrode. Analogously analyses of the peak currents versus scan rate in the CV of the unconjugated enzyme on bare GC electrodes showed $1.4 Â 10À10 mol/cm2 enzymes were non-specifically immobilized on the electrode. The surface coverage of the CYP101 enzyme, both in case of pyrene maleimide conjugated as well as of unconjugated forms were found to be higher than that reported earlier with cytochrome P450BM3 [28,29], although the electron transfer rates may be lower (see later). Although the enzyme was immobilized on the electrode, Fig. 6 shows that the peak separation in the cyclic voltammogram was quite large. This indicated that the electron transfer from the electrode to the immobilized enzyme was slow. The rate of heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and the immobilized enzyme was estimated by the Laviron's method [39]. The value of the transfer coefficient (a) was determined using Eq. (2):
Epc ¼ E0 À      RT anF m RT anF RT ln ln ln ðmÞ ¼ E0 À À RTks anF RTks anF anF      RT ð1 À aÞnF m RT ð1 À aÞnF RT 0 0 ln ln ln ðmÞ ¼ E þ þ Epa ¼ E þ ð1 À aÞnF ð1 À aÞnF RTks ð1 À aÞnF RTks ð2Þ

where DEp is the peak potential separation. Using the value of a as 0.56, the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant for the immobilized pyrene-conjugated enzyme was found to be 0.21 ± 0.02 sÀ1. The rate of electron transfer from the electrode to the unconjugated enzyme under analogous conditions was found to be smaller (0.016 sÀ1) than that with the immobilized pyreneconjugated enzyme in the present experimental conditions. It is important to note that the rate of electron transfer to the CYP101 from its natural redox partner, Pdx is 27­84 sÀ1 [40], which is much larger than that observed in the present case. This indicated that though the present method of immobilization shows significant enhancement in the electron transfer to CYP101, but we are still far from mimicking the biological partner (Pdx) of the enzyme [40]. In order to assay whether the immobilized enzyme was indeed active and the specific linkage of the enzyme to the electrode (through either C136 or C58) was indeed able to efficiently drive the catalytic cycle of the enzyme, we investigated the enzymatic activity of the pyrene maleimide conjugated CYP101 immobilized on glassy carbon electrode. The cyclic voltammetry of the immobilized enzyme electrode in oxygen saturated buffer in presence of different concentrations of camphor was studied. The reversible electrode reaction in absence of oxygen is shown in Eq. (4).

The fast oxygen binding occurs after one-electron transfer to form short-lived ferrous-dioxygen complex (Eq. (5)) which readily accepts a second electron and a proton to convert to ferric hydroperoxo heme, which readily accepts one proton to heterolytically cleave the peroxo-group to form the ferryl-heme radical intermediate known as

Compound I (Eq. (6)). The Compound I, may transfer the active oxygen to the substrate (in case of the camphor bound enzyme) completing the enzymatic cycle and enhancing the catalytic current (Eq. (7)). The hydroperoxo species may also produce H2O2 (Eq. (8)) in the absence of the substrate [7]. Electrocatalytic reduction of the generated peroxide in absence of the substrate may also lead to the observation of a catalytic current (Eq. (8)). This is the oxygen-slip mechanism that occurs in presence of oxygen when substrate is absent. The cyclic voltammetric results showed linear increase of the catalytic current at À0.39 V (versus Ag/AgCl) with increasing concentration of the substrate (Fig. 9). The non-specifically bound wild type enzyme also showed electrocatalytic activity, but the slope of the plot of the catalytic current versus camphor concentration, in case of the specifically bound enzyme was $2.5 times higher than that of the non-specifically bound wild type enzyme. The observed electrocatalytic activity of the non-specifically adsorbed wild type enzyme on the electrode may actually correspond to that of the enzyme molecules which are oriented in the proper configuration with respect to the electrode so that the electron transfer patch was closer to the electrode. In order to assess the catalytic activity of the immobilized enzyme, we carried out ESI-mass spectroscopic studies on the electrocatalytic reaction solution containing 1 mM camphor at

different time intervals during the electrocatalysis by the enzyme electrodes. ESI-mass spectrum of the reaction solution showed that prior the electrocatalysis, the mass spectrum of the sample extracted in chloroform showed a single peak at m/z 153 (Fig. 10A) confirming the presence of pure camphor in the solution. The mass spectra of the reaction mixture after electrocatalysis for 10 min using a non-specifically adsorbed unconjugated CYP101 containing GC electrode showed formation of only a small amount of hydroxycamphor as evident from a weak peak at m/z 169 (Fig. 10B). Since the active site and substrate-binding cavity was unchanged the reaction product would be 5-exo-hydroxycamphor (Fig. 1) with molecular weight 169. The peak for hydroxycamphor was found to be much more intense (Fig. 10C) when pyrene maleimide linked CYP101 immobilized on the GC electrode was used for the electrocatalysis of the camphor solution. This indicates that the CYP101 enzyme immobilized to the electrode by pyrene maleimide conjugation is more efficient in catalyzing the hydroxylation of the substrate compared to the unconjugated enzyme non-specifically adsorbed to the electrode. This supports that electron transport from the electrode to the pyrene maleimide conjugated immobilized enzyme enable better enzymatic activity compared to that from the electrode to the unconjugated non-specifically adsorbed enzyme. The intensity of the hydroxycamphor peak (m/z 169) was increased further on continuing the electrocatalysis for extended time (Fig. 10D), indicating that the pyrene maleimide conjugated immobilized enzyme was indeed catalytically active for longer time. 4. Conclusions The direct electrochemistry of CYP101 and electrocatalysis (in presence of oxygen) of camphor by the enzyme electrode were successfully realized by immobilizing CYP101 on the pyrene maleimide modified glassy carbon electrode. In the absence of dissolved oxygen, the immobilized CYP101 showed a direct and quasi-reversible electron transfer with a midpoint potential of À330 mV (versus Ag/AgCl) at pH 7.4. In an air-saturated solution, the CYP101 showed electrocatalytic response. With the aid of

ESIMS technique the product of the electrocatalytic reaction was analyzed. Peak at m/z 169 showed the electrochemical formation of hydroxycamphor from camphor by catalytic monooxygenation of camphor. With the passage of time the formation of hydroxycamphor was increased, as indicated by increase in intensity of the m/z 169 peak. The amount of the hydroxycamphor in case of the pyrene-conjugated enzyme specifically immobilized to the electrode is more than that of the unconjugated enzyme non-specifically attached to the electrode.
