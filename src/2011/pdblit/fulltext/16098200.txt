The gene coding for a hemoglobin-like protein (Tf-trHb) has been identified in the thermophilic actinobacterium Thermobifida fusca and cloned in Escherichia coli for overexpression. The crystal structure of the ferric, ace° tate-bound derivative, was obtained at 2.48 A resolution. The three-dimensional structure of Tf-trHb is similar to structures reported for the truncated hemoglobins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Bacillus subtilis in its central domain. The complete lack of diffraction patterns relative to the N- and C-terminal segments indicates that these are unstructured polypeptides chains, consistent with their facile cleavage in solution. The absence of internal cavities and the presence of two water molecules between the bound acetate ion and the protein surface suggest that the mode of ligand entry is similar to that of typical hemoglobins. The protein is characterized by higher thermostability than the similar mesophilic truncated hemoglobin from B. subtilis, as demonstrated by far-UV CD melting experiments on the cyano-met derivatives. The ligand-binding properties of Tf-trHb, analyzed in stopped flow experiments, demonstrate that Tf-trHb is capable of efficient O2 binding and release between 55 and 60 °C, the optimal growth temperature for Thermobifida fusca.

The identification of globin genes in lower organisms including bacteria, yeasts, algae, protozoa and fungi has challenged the common perception of hemoglobins as oxygen transport proteins [1]. Most recently, ancestral globin genes have been found in thermophilic Archaea thus corroborating the idea that hemoglobins were designed for roles other than oxygen transport in the primordial atmosphere [2]. Thus, in the evolutionary context, oxygen transport appears as an emergent function, customized from much older physiological

roles, possibly concerned with NO catabolism or oxygen detoxification [2,3]. The Archaea globins have been postulated to be ancestors of bacterial globins and have been termed protoglobins accordingly. Evolution of protoglobin genes has been suggested to give rise to different globin subfamilies whose physiological function diverged. At present, phylogenetic analyses have suggested at least two major descendants of Archaea's protoglobins, namely the globin-coupled sensors (GCS) and the truncated hemoglobins [2]. GCS include

a number of chimeric proteins in which the globin domain is fused with a transducer domain involved in aerotaxis or gene expression regulation [3]. By contrast, truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) share little sequence and structure similarity to oxygen sensor domains in that they lack two of the eight helices typical of the globin fold and exhibit a wide array of amino acid substitutions within the active site. Thus, trHbs have been assigned to a distinct group within the globin superfamily and further gathered into three separate subgroups [4]. An extensive sequence search, carried out as a preliminary investigation for this study, led to the identification of four genes coding for hemoglobin-like proteins within the genome of the thermophilic actinobacterium Thermobifida fusca, namely a protoglobin (Tf-Pgb) [2], a truncated hemoglobin (Tf-trHb), a flavohemoglobin (Tf-FHb) and an additional globin-like protein (NCBI Accession nos GI:48836482, GI:48835434, GI:48835716 and GI:48835900, respectively). The occurrence of a protoglobin together with other hemoglobin genes within the same micro-organism suggests that the evolutionary relationships among these proteins and their physiological role might not imply a common protoglobin ancestor and certainly do not support a common functional hypothesis. Moreover, the presence of hemoglobins in thermophilic micro-organisms brings out other fundamental questions concerning the structural parameters responsible for the thermal stability of these proteins with respect to their mesophilic counterparts and their ability to cope with gaseous ligands at high temperatures. The stability properties and folding pathways of mesophilic globins from vertebrates and invertebrates have been extensively investigated [4­7]. In general, the holo-globin structure is very stable, so that myoglobins are resistant to thermal denaturation under physiological pH conditions and in the absence of denaturants [8]. The stability of the classical eight-helices globin fold is, in fact, strongly affected by the presence of the heme cofactor, as shown by the considerably lower resistance to thermal or denaturant-induced unfolding exhibited by apo-globins with respect to the holo-forms. In addition, vertebrate myoglobins are inefficient in exchanging gaseous ligands at temperatures > 50 °C due to effects other than thermal unfolding, namely heme iron auto-oxidation and heme loss. Thus, an interplay between globin stability, heme affinity and even heme iron redox / ligation state renders the overall (holo) globin folding process a very complex one [9]. Within this framework, the identification of hemoglobin-like proteins in thermophilic organisms is of extreme interest in order to understand the structural parameters

that lead to thermostability and the behavior of the highly reactive heme moiety towards heat stress. On these bases, the Tf-trHb protein has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli for X-ray structure solution and functional characterization. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the thermostability of Tf-trHb as a holoprotein, assess its oxygen-binding properties within the temperature range in which T. fusca grows optimally (55­60 °C) and identify putative structural determinants of thermostability by comparing the crystal structure of Tf-trHb with those of similar mesophilic proteins.

Results
Sequence analysis The structure-based sequence alignments (Fig. 1) show that Tf-trHb is closely related to truncated hemoglobins, in particular those belonging to group II [4]. The major difference among the sequence of Tf-trHb with respect to those of the truncated hemoglobins shown in Fig. 1 is the presence of a C-terminal extension, approximately 25 amino acids long, in the former protein. A complete alignment of nonredundant truncated hemoglobins from the NCBI, SwissProt and Pfam databases and the phylogenetic tree generated from that alignment, can be found in the supplementary material. Three-dimensional structure The overall fold of Tf-trHb conforms to that of the other two group II hemoglobins whose structure has previously been determined by X-ray crystallography: Mt-trHbO (PDB code: 1NGK) [10] and Bs-trHb (PDB code: 1UX8) [11]. In fact, Tf-trHb displays a two-over-two alpha helical structure formed by the helices B, E, G and H (see Fig. 2, left panel); shorter F and A helices than in the classical globin fold; absence of helices C and D; presence of an additonal phi-helix between helices E and F. The superposition between the main-chain atoms of Tf-trHb and Mt-trHbO (58% sequence identity) yields a root ° mean square deviation of 0.79 A over 120 equivalent residues, whereas the superposition of Tf-trHb and Bs-trHb (42% sequence identity) yields root mean ° square deviation of 1.11 A over 115 equivalent residues (the 113 residues which are structurally conserved between the three proteins are boxed in Fig. 1). The major differences among the three proteins are the absence of helix A in Bs-trHb and the presence of a helix C in Mt-HbO, as well as some

differences in the flexible regions (CD1 loop, pre-F loop, loop between helices G and H, C-terminal tail). A striking difference between the overall structure of Tf-trHb and those of other truncated hemoglobins is the absence of internal cavities in the former protein [10,11]. Both Mt-trHbO and Bs-trHb contain internal cavities, although much smaller than those found in group I trHbs [12]. In Tf-trHb, some of these cavities are filled by substitutions with larger residues (e.g. Trp87 and Trp141 replace Leu57 of Bs-trHb and Leu113 of Mt-trHbO, respectively), others by conformational differences of conserved or similar size residues (e.g. Met123 and Leu78, corresponding to Met93 and Gln49 of Bs-trHb, and Leu49, corresponding to Ile18 of Mt-trHbO). Proximal heme pocket The architecture of the proximal heme pocket of Tf-trHb is dominated by residues Phe82, Tyr93, Leu102, Arg105-F7, His106-F8 and Ile111, conserved in both Mt-trHbO and Bs-trHb (Fig. 1). Moreover, Tyr143 and Ala147 are conserved with respect to

Mt-trHbO (and replaced by Arg and Thr, respectively, in Bs-trHb) whereas Met151-H10 is conserved with respect to Bs-trHb and substituted by leucine in MttrHbO (Figs 1 and 3), and Tyr109 is subtituted by Phe in both Mt-trHbO and Bs-trHb. The His106-F8 is bonded to the Fe(III) of the heme with an unusually ° short distance (N-Fe(III) ¼ 1.92 A). Distal heme pocket The residues involved in the formation of the ligandstabilizing hydrogen-bonded network, namely Tyr-B10, Tyr-CD1 and Trp-G8 are conserved in the three proteins (Figs 1 and 3). The oxygen atom OXT of the acetate ion is bound almost perpendicularly to the ferric ° heme iron at a distance of 1.67 A (Fig. 2, right panel). The acetate ion ligand is stabilized by interactions with residues Tyr67-CD1 and Trp119-G8. The carbonyl oxygen of the acetate ion is hydrogen bonded to the OH group of Tyr67-CD1 and to the Trp119-G8 indole NE1 ° atom (distances ¼ 2.86 and 2.52 A, respectively; Fig. 2). Trp119-G8 is essentially parallel to the heme plane as also observed in Bs-trHb and Mt-trHbO [10,11].

In particular, the visible band at 584 nm of the oxygenated adduct and the presence of a high-spin marker band at 630 nm of the ferric derivative are common features of Tf-trHb and Mt-trHbO.

Reversibility was however, observed for both proteins only in the presence of GdmCl > 0.5 m. The data indicate that Tf-trHb is indeed significantly more thermostable than its mesophilic homolog under all conditions examined. Analysis of thermal melting profiles of Fig. 6 highlights that both Tf-trHb and Bs-trHb are characterized by similar DCp values, whereas the DHTm and Tm values were constantly higher for the thermophilic hemoglobin (Fig. 6). In order to compare thermal stabilities to solvent stabilities, isothermal GdmCl denaturation experiments were carried out at 25 °C (Fig. 7). The results obtained indicated clearly that m and D50% values are very similar for both proteins (see legend to Fig. 7), the Bs-trHb possessing an even slightly higher D50% value.

The four panels describe the kinetics of oxygen binding (A, C) and release (B, D) as obtained in oxygen-pulse experiments. The measurements were carried out by mixing a solution of Tf-trHb (8 lM) containing excess dithionite with oxygen containing buffers (0.25 M phosphate at pH 70) at 25 °C, observation k ¼ 430 nm. Time courses of the reaction at constant oxygen and as a function of dithionite concentration (from top to bottom: 25, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5 mM after mixing, respectively) are reported in (A) (0.1 s time range) and (B) (50 s time range).

In this experiment, the oxygen-binding rate was slow enough to allow observation of the oxygen combination process during the first tens of milliseconds after mixing under the appropriate dithionite concentration range. Within the same measurement, expansion of the observation time over 50 s also allowed the monitoring of the oxygen-release process. Thus, the measurements shown in Fig. 8 provided both the rate of oxygen binding, in the first 100 ms after mixing, and the rate of oxygen release in the following 50 s. The rates of oxygen release, measured in the presence of 5­25 mm sodium dithionite, were independent of dithionite concentration. As a control, the oxygenbinding process was also measured by mixing the deoxygenated protein in the absence of dithionite (and presence of an enzymatic oxygen scavenging system) directly with oxygen-containing buffers.

signal recovery was identical from 20 to 70 °C, demonstrating that the protein is capable of exchanging oxygen reversibly at high temperatures and does not denature even at the highest temperature. Nevertheless, the Arrhenius plots were not linear above 55 °C, due to the large increase in the observed rate of oxygen consumption by dithionite. The activation enthalpy of the oxygen-release process was 18.8 ± 0.2 kcalÆmol)1, whereas the activation enthalpy for the oxygen-binding process was 6.65 ± 0.15 kcalÆmol)1.

Discussion
The presence of a gene coding for a truncated hemoglobin (Tf-trHb) in the thermophilic actinobacterium Thermobifida fusca is particularly intriguing in view of its coexistance with at least three different globin genes, including a gene encoding for a protoglobin (Tfpgb), postulated to be the ancestor of the globin family [2]. Structure based sequence alignments show unambiguously that Tf-trHb is closely related to Mt-trHbO and Bs-trHb (58 and 42% sequence identity, respectively, in the structurally conserved regions, see Fig. 1 and Supplementary material). In turn, there is no significant sequence similarity between Tf-trHb and other globin families identified so far in thermophilic species (i.e. protoglobins and globin-coupled oxygen sensors), including Tf-pgb. Thus, Tf-trHb is the first truncated hemoglobin identified to date in a thermophilic organism. The three-dimensional structure of Tf-trHb does not comprise the N-terminal fragment up to amino acid 34 nor the C-terminal segment from amino acids 163­188. As a matter of fact, the N- and C-terminal tails are

predicted to be unstructured and have been shown to be easily cleaved in solution (Experimental procedures). Comparison of the crystal structure of Tf-trHb with homologous proteins from B. subtilis (Bs-trHb) and M. tubercolosis (Mt-trHbO) indicates that notable identities concern the amino acids that build up the heme pocket [10,11]. In particular, distal heme pocket residues, that have been shown to dominate the ligand-binding properties in Mt-trHbO (Phe-B9, TyrB10, Tyr-CD1, Ala-E7, Leu-E11 and Trp-G8), are all conserved in Tf-trHb, whereas the architecture of the proximal heme pocket shares similarity to that of Bs-trHb (e.g. Met151 in Tf-trHb corresponds to Met121 in Bs-trHb, see Figs 1 and 3). Comparison among the three active site structures in Fig. 3 shows that the coordinates of Trp119-G8 and Phe53-B9 can be superimposed in all proteins, despite the presence of different iron bound ligands (oxygen in Mt-trHbO, cyanide in Bs-trHb and acetate in Tf-trHb), whereas Tyr54-B10 and Tyr67-CD1 display different conformations in Tf-trHb. In particular, Tyr54-B10 is shifted away from the distal heme pocket, thus opening a gate that may provide a route for the ligand into the pocket. This is further highlighted by the presence of two water molecules (W15 and W64) along the pathway that leads from the solvent to the distal pocket (Fig. 2). W15, more internal, is hydrogen bonded to ° the OH group of Tyr54-B10 (distance ¼ 2.89 A) and ° ). W64 is also hydrogen to W64 (distance ¼ 2.95 A bonded to one of the heme propionates, which is held into place by a salt-bridge with Arg78-E10. Two hydrogen-bonded water molecules in essentially the same position as those of Tf-trHb are also found in the heme distal site of Mt-trHbO, although the specific hydrogen bond interactions they establish with the protein residues differ slightly between the two proteins [10]. The high similarity of the Tf-trHb with truncated hemoglobins suggested that the thermal stability of the protein can be conveniently studied in parallel with a mesophilic homolog. The full reversibility of the thermal melting processes in the presence of GdmCl allowed us to estimate the overall thermodynamic parameters of the folding process. It must be stressed that all data were obtained on holoproteins in their cyano-met forms and thus the measured thermodynamic parameters are overall constants, inclusive of the heme release / uptake process. Based on these considerations, the thermal melting profiles of the cyanide Tf-trHb and Bs-trHb adducts demonstrate unambiguously that Tf-trHb has a significantly higher thermostability than its mesophilic homolog. Melting temperatures were, in fact, higher for Tf-trHb

with respect to Bs-trHb under all GdmCl concentrations examined (Figs 5 and 6). In turn, analysis of the temperature dependence of the unfolding enthalpies (DHTm versus Tm, Fig. 6) reveals that the DCp values (the slopes of the fitting lines of Fig. 6) are very similar for both proteins. Intriguingly, the GdmCl denaturation profiles (Fig. 7) can also be superimposed in Tf-trHb and in Bs-trHb, with D50% values of 3.4 and 3.55 m GdmCl, respectively. The similar DCp and m-values obtained in thermal melting and solvent denaturation experiments are indicative of a similar solvent accessible surface area in Tf-trHb and Bs-trHb upon protein unfolding [15] and suggest that the origin of thermostability in Tf-trHb can be accounted for by the presence of a specific enthalpic contribution, proposed to be electrostatic in nature [16]. On these bases, a possible structural basis for thermostability in Tf-trHb with respect to Bs-trHb or Mt-trHbO was searched in terms of additional structure stabilizing interactions in the former protein. However, comparative structure analyses indicate clearly that there are no significant differences in the overall number of hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges or in the number of fully buried hydrophobic residues between the thermophilic protein and its mesophilic homologs. At most, based on agadir predictions of helical content in peptides (E. Lacroix, M. Petukhov & L. Serrano, http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/Services/ serrano/agadir/agadir-start.html), Tf-trHb residues in alpha-helical regions have a higher helical propensity than the corresponding residues of the two mesophilic proteins Bs-trHb and Mt-trHbO (3.85 and 1.64 folds, respectively). Nevertheless, it is of interest to consider that at variance with Bs-trHb and Mt-trHbO, Tf-trHb does not present internal cavities. Filling of internal holes has been previously suggested to be a stabilizing element for globin structures [17]. Thus, it may be inferred that the thermal stability of Tf-trHb is at least partially determined by the absence of internal cavities. Site-directed mutagenesis will be carried out in order to demonstrate this intriguing hypothesis. The ligand-binding properties of Tf-trHb at 25 °C can be compared with those obtained for its mesophilic homologs. Significant differences are observed with respect to both Mt-trHbO and Bs-trHb (Table 2). Nevertheless, Tf-trHb shares a relatively slow rate of oxygen binding with Mt-trHbO in sharp contrast with the very high apparent rate of oxygen binding in Bs-trHb [11]. Given the identity of the relevant residues in the distal pocket of Tf-trHb and Mt-trHbO, the observed differences might be attributed to the single substitution occurring within the proximal

pocket (Leu123 in Mt-trHbO and Met151 in TftrHb). Different figures in the estimate of the rates of oxygen release between Mt-trHbO and Tf-trHb might also arise from the different methods used to monitor the oxygen dissociation reaction. In particular, the unusual dependence of the observed rate of oxygen release upon dithionite concentration, reported for both Mt-trHbO [18] and Bs-trHb [11] has been suggested to include a redox process in which electrons are transferred from the dithionite to a protein acceptor residue and eventually to oxygen (to yield superoxide) [11]. Thus, in order to overcome the possible contribution of an additional redox process, an oxygen-pulse experiment was used to monitor both the rates of oxygen binding and release of Tf-trHb. In this type of experiment, the protein is in contact with dithionite before encountering oxygen and thus it is kept in a homogeneously reduced state. Within the oxygen-pulse experiment, the observed rates of oxygen binding and release are consistently mono-exponential (instead of bi-exponential as in Mt-trHbO) [18], display the expected oxygen concentration dependence (truly second order for oxygen binding) and are independent of dithionite concentration (within the time regimes in which oxygen consumption by dithionite does not interfere with oxygen binding to the protein, see Fig. 8). Along this line, it is of interest to note that the second-order rates for oxygen binding in Tf-trHb are almost identical to those corresponding to the second phase in MttrHbO (Table 2).

Besides the direct comparison with the kinetic behavior of Mt-trHbO at 25 °C, it is of high interest to assess the ligand-binding properties of Tf-trHb within the thermal regime that competes to the physiological environment of T. fusca, i.e. an optimum growth temperature of 55­60 °C. At present, despite the identification of several hemoglobin-like proteins in thermophilic organisms [2], the thermal behavior of thermophilic hemoglobins in terms of ligand-binding properties has not been reported yet. In order to provide a complete picture of the ligand-binding properties of Tf-trHb at high temperature, the oxygen-pulse experiment was carried out up to 70 °C. The experimental set-up of the oxygen-pulse experiment has proven to be well suited to analyze the temperature dependence of the oxygen-binding and -release reactions. In fact, under selected dithionite concentrations (depending also upon temperature), it is possible to investigate the kinetics over the full temperature range in the absence of unwanted side reactions such as heme iron oxidation. The results obtained highlight several aspects of the reaction of Tf-trHb with oxygen. First of all, it is important to note that the activation enthalpy for the oxygen-dissociation reaction is identical (% 19 kcalÆmol)1) to that measured for vertebrate Hbs and Mbs20, thus indicating that the bond dissociation energy of the iron-oxygen adduct is the same in all these hemoglobins. In turn, the activation enthalpy of the oxygen-binding process (6.65 kcalÆmol)1) is 1 ± 0.2 kcalÆmol)1 higher than that measured in vertebrate Hbs and Mbs [19]. The higher activation enthalpy of the oxygen combination process may reflect a different stereochemistry of the deoxy heme in Tf-trHb with respect to that of vertebrate Hbs, possibly correlated to the unusual iron-histidine conformation described for several truncated hemoglobins [10,11,20]. Combining the values of oxygen binding (3.3 lm)1Æs)1) and release (4.1 s)1) rates at 60 °C yields an estimate of the oxygen affinity of 0.8 lm)1. This figure (remarkably similar to that of horse Mb at 37 °C) is certainly not consistent with a physiological role of Tf-trHb as an oxygen sensor in that sensitivity in the nm range would be required [3] and suggests that Tf-trHb is involved in oxygen exchange for metabolic purposes (possibly, oxygen delivery to the respiratory chain) or in oxygen activation for catalytic purposes (NO scavenging or peroxidase-like activity). Both hypotheses are under investigation in view of the possible applications of Tf-trHb in sustaining the growth of biotechnologically relevant thermophilic bacteria, in the same way as Vitreoscilla hemoglobin enhances growth rate and cell densities in the case of mesophilic micro-organisms [21].

Experimental procedures
Cloning, expression and purification of recombinant Tf-trHb
A synthetic gene coding for T. fusca hemoglobin has been constructed by GENEART (Regensberg, Germany) with optimized E. coli codons. The gene, designed with NcoI / HindIII restriction sites, was cloned within puC19 KpnI cloning site by GENEART. The insert was digested with restriction enzymes NcoI and HindIII (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), loaded onto an agarose gel and purified with the DNA gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified fragment was inserted into a pET23-d expression vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) cut with the same restriction enzymes. Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and the colonies with the correct DNA insert were selected through PCR screening. E. coli cells were grown overnight in Luria­Bertani medium containing 100 lgÆmL)1 ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by adding 250 lm isopropyl b-d-galactoside overnight-grown cells. After 4 h, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in a minimum volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris / HCl pH 8.0, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated until the supernatant was reddish and clear. After centrifugation at 17 418 g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman International Ltd, Maidstone, UK) equilibrated with 20 mm NaPi buffer pH 7.0 and eluted with a NaCl step gradient (0­0.15 m). Further purification was obtained through gel-filtration on a Sephadex G75 column (Amersham-Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate pH 7.0. Approximately 50 mg of pure, ferrous oxygenated protein were obtained from this procedure per liter of culture. The protein purified from the supernatant fraction underwent an unexpected cleavage phenomenon. In fact, when repeating the SDS / PAGE after a few days from the purification procedure, a novel protein band appeared at % 15 kDa in addition to the expected 21 kDa band. The presence of this additional band was attributed to the cleavage of the native protein by trace amounts of proteases copurifying with the protein. Nevertheless, addition of proteases inhibitors cocktails or metal chelators (EDTA, diethylenetriamino pentaacetic acid) did not alter the SDS / PAGE profile (data not shown). From SDS analysis, it was apparent that a very large amount of protein was still present in the pellet fraction, most likely embedded in inclusion bodies. Thus, a second purification procedure was employed in order to recover the protein from the pellet fraction while eliminating putative contaminant proteases. Pellets were dissolved in 8 m urea buffered at pH 7.0 with 20 mm phosphate buffer by gentle stirring for 1 h at 20 °C. The urea solution was centrifuged at 17 418 g for 15 min and the supernatant was

loaded directly onto a DEAE-cellulose column. The column was washed with 1 vol. of 20 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and the protein was eluted with 20­200 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.0 gradient. This procedure yielded % 600 mg (per liter of culture) of apo-protein with a purity > 90% (as judged from SDS / PAGE densitometric analysis). The apoprotein was reconstituted with heme (dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH) in 0.2 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 at 20 °C. The reconstituted protein was then dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and then loaded onto a hydroxyl-apatite column (Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The hemoglobin, eluted with a phosphate gradient (from 10 to 50 mm, pH 7.0), was obtained as a ferric derivative. Reduction of the protein with dithionite and passage through a G-25 column yielded the oxygenated derivative whose spectrum was indistinguishable from that obtained from the soluble fraction.

quality of the structure was assessed by the program procheck [26]. The Ramachandran plot contains 92.3% of the residues in the most favored region. The most important structural and refinement statistics are listed in Table 2.

Sequence and structure analysis
Sequences of trHbs were obtained from the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/) [27], UniProt (http:// www.expasy.uniprot.org/) [28]), and Pfam (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/) [29]), protein sequence databases. The starting sequence alignment provided by clustalw [30] was manually adjusted based on the structural alignment between Tf-trHb and previously determined structures of trHbs obtained from the Protein Data Bank (http:// www.rcsb.org), namely the two group II proteins: Bs-trHb (PDB code: 1UX8) [11] and Mt-trHbO (PDB code: 1NGK) [10], and the group I proteins: Mt-trHbN, Chlamydomonas eugamentos, Paramecium caudatum and Synechocystis sp. TrHbs (PDB codes: 1IDR, 1DLY, 1DLW, 1MWB, respectively). clustalx was used to create the distance tree, using the neighbor-joining method, and to calculate bootstraps (10 000 replicates). Trees were visualized and printed using the njplot program [31]. Protein secondary structure and solvent accessible surface area were calculated with the dssp [32] and naccess [33] programs. insightii [34] and its Biopolymer module were used for hydrogen bond and contact calculations and for structure visualization.

Protein crystallization and data collection
Crystallization of ferric Tf-trHb was achieved at 293°K by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion technique. A 2 lL volume of protein at 20 mgÆmL)1 equilibrated against 0.05 m NaPi buffer, pH 7.0, was mixed with an equal amount of the reservoir solution containing NaCl in a range between 1.8 and 2.7 m and acetate buffer 0.1 m, in the pH range 5.5­6.5. Crystals grew in 2 weeks and were very small. The deposited structural factors were calculated from a data set collected using the MAR CCD detector on the X-ray beamline XRD1 at ELETTRA, Basovizza (Trieste, Italy), at ° 2.48 A resolution. The data were collected at 100 K using 26% glycerol as cryo-protectant. Intensities were integrated with denzo and scaled with scalepack [22]. The data analysis indicates that the crystal is hexagonal (P6422) with unit cell dimensions of a ¼ 84.617, b ¼ 84.617, c ¼ ° 77.921 A, alpha ¼ 90°, beta ¼ 90°, gamma ¼ 120°; the asymmetric unit contains one molecule. The data scaling gave an Rmerge of 5% and a v2 ¼ 0.82. The data set is ° 96.7% complete at 2.48 A resolution.

Spectroscopic characterization
Absorption spectra in the UV-Vis region were measured on a Jasco V-570 spectrophotometer (Jasco Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Molar absorptivities were determined by dissolving the protein in 10% SDS containing 1 m imidazole and 0.1 m NaOH [35]. The absorptivity of the native protein was thus estimated to be 182 000 ± 1200 m)1Æcm)1 at 421 nm for the ferrous CO adduct. CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Thermal unfolding experiments in the far-UV region were carried out in a stoppered 0.1 cm quartz cell at protein concentrations of 10­12 lm heme. A temperature slope of 1 °CÆmin)1 yielded fully reproducible results for temperature increase melting profiles whereas a slope of 0.2 °CÆmin)1 was necessary in order to reproduce reversibility curves from 90 to 20 °C. Denaturation free energies were determined in temperature-melting experiments at different GdmCl (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) concentrations, assuming a two-state model, in the framework of the Gibbs-Helmotz equation [35]: DGunf ¼ DHTm ÀTDHTm =Tm þDCp ½T ÀTm ÀTlnðT=Tm Þ ð1Þ Accordingly, the fitting of the melting profiles as a function of T yielded the unfolding enthalpy, DHTm, the melting temperature, Tm, and the heat capacity change associated

Structure solution and refinement
The X-ray structure of the truncated hemoglobin from T. fusca was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the truncated hemoglobin from B. subtilis (PDB code: 1UX8) as search probe. The rotational and translational searches, performed with the program mol° rep [23] in the resolution range of 10­3.0 A, produced a clear solution. Refinement of the atomic coordinates and displacement parameters was carried out with the program refmac 5 [24]. Model building was performed using the program package xtalview [25]. The structure has been refined to an Rfactor of 22% and an Rfree of 31%. The final model includes 122 residues (34­156), 1 heme molecule, 64 water molecules, and 1 acetate anion. The

to the unfolding process, DCp°. Two sloped baselines were also fitted to take into account temperature-dependent effects uncorrelated with the cooperative folding process [36]. GdmCl denaturation experiments were carried out in 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 2 mm KCN at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Experiments were carried out by monitoring the far-UV CD spectra. The CD signal at 225 nm as a function of GdmCl concentration was followed with a slit aperture of 4 nm. In the experiments (T ¼ 25 °C) samples were equilibrated for 4 h in GdmCl before measurement. Full reversibility of the denaturation process was observed under these conditions. Solvent denaturation curves were fitted to the simple two state model according to the formalism described by Clarke et al. [37]: DGX ¼ DGunf À m½X unf ð2Þ

where X represents the GdmCl concentration, DGX is the unf solvent-dependent denaturation free energy, DGunf is the unfolding free energy at X ¼ 0 and m is a fitting constant representing the differential binding of GdmCl between the folded and unfolded state. Least squares minimizations were carried out by the matlab 6.0 program (South Natick, MA).

Kinetic measurements Reaction with oxygen
The oxygen binding kinetics was measured by direct mixing of the deoxygenated protein against buffer containing varying amounts of dissolved oxygen. In this case, the deoxygenated protein solution was prepared according to Kundu et al. [38]. The reduced protein (6 mL total volume) was transferred to a stopped flow syringe and 2 mL of a 5 mgÆmL)1 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase solution were added. The syringe was left 15 min in the stopped flow apparatus until the signal at 430 nm (the peak of the deoxygenated derivative) reached the expected value indicating that the protein was fully deoxygenated. Thereafter, the deoxygenated protein was mixed with oxygenated buffer containing varying amounts of oxygen. Oxygen binding and release kinetics were also measured in an oxygen-pulse experiment by mixing a solution of Tf-trHb (16 lm) containing an excess of sodium dithionite (0.5­50 mm) in 0.25 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 with oxygenated buffer. At each dithionite concentration, two time courses were collected, the first over 100 ms and the second over 50 s. Within the shorter time regime an absorbance decrease at 430 nm and a corresponding increase at 416 nm were observed, corresponding to oxygen binding to the deoxygenated protein. Within the longer time regime, the absorbance values changed in the opposite direction, thus indicating that the observed signal corresponds to the formation of the deoxygenated derivative accompanying the release of oxygen. A lag phase

was observed between the short and the long time regime the duration of which depended on dithionite concentration. In order to determine quantitatively the rates of oxygen binding and release the following additional measurements were carried out. First, the rate of oxygen consumption by dithionite was measured in both the short and long time regimes within the dithionite concentration range used in the oxygen-pulse experiment. Oxygen consumption rates were measured by monitoring the absorbance decay at 300 nm (from 0.5 to 2.5 mm dithionite) or at 240 nm (from 2.5 to 15 mm dithionite) using observation path lengths of 1 or 0.2 cm. Second, the oxygen-pulse experiment was carried out as a function of oxygen concentration by diluting the oxygenated buffer with a degassed one. Four oxygen concentrations were examined: 270, 135, 65 and 35 lm (before mixing). These measurements allowed us to identify a dithionite concentration range (0.5­2 mm, before mixing) in which the oxygen consumption by dithionite is slow enough to consider oxygen concentration (after mixing) constant during the time course of second-order oxygen binding to the protein (100 ms). At the other extreme, namely, at dithionite concentrations > 5 mm (before mixing), oxygen consumption by dithionite was fast enough to consider the 50 s time courses as entirely accounted for by the simple oxygen dissociation reaction from the oxyhemoglobin. Temperature dependence of the oxygen binding and release kinetics was also carried out under the same experimental set-up.
