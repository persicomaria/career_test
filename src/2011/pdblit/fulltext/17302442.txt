ABSTRACT: Chemokines adopt a conserved tertiary structure stabilized by two disulfide bridges and direct the migration of leukocytes. Lymphotactin (Ltn) is a unique chemokine in that it contains only one disulfide and exhibits large-scale structural heterogeneity. Under physiological solution conditions (37 °C and 150 mM NaCl), Ltn is in equilibrium between the canonical chemokine fold (Ltn10) and a distinct fourstranded -sheet (Ltn40). Consequently, it has not been possible to address the biological significance of each structural species independently. To stabilize the Ltn10 structure in a manner independent of specific solution conditions, Ltn variants containing a second disulfide bridge were designed. Placement of the new cysteines was based on a sequence alignment of Ltn with either the first (Ltn-CC1) or third disulfide (Ltn-CC3) in the CC chemokine, HCC-2. NMR data demonstrate that both CC1 and CC3 retain the Ltn10 chemokine structure and no longer exhibit structural rearrangement. The ability of each mutant to activate the Ltn receptor, XCR1, has been tested using an intracellular Ca2+ flux assay. These data support the conclusion that the chemokine fold of Ltn10 is responsible for receptor activation. We also examined the role of amino- and carboxyl-terminal residues in Ltn-mediated receptor activation. In contrast to previous reports, we find that the 25 residues comprising the novel C-terminal extension do not participate in receptor activation, while the native N-terminus is absolutely required for Ltn function.

Chemokines are small, secreted proteins that signal leukocytes to migrate during an immune response. Binding of chemokines to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 stimulates cell chemotaxis, while diffusion and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding are believed to establish the chemokine gradient that migrating cells follow. Approximately 50 chemokines have been identified and are classified into four subfamilies (CXC, CC, CX3C, and C) based on the spacing of two cysteine residues near the N-terminus, each of which contributes to a pair of conserved disulfide bonds (1). Lymphotactin (Ltn), the only example of a C-type chemokine, lacks the first and third cysteine residues found in all other chemokines and contains a unique extended C-terminal sequence that is conserved across species (2). We have previously shown that under physiological conditions

(37 °C and 150 mM NaCl), Ltn exhibits reversible conformational heterogeneity, converting between two distinct structural species. The relative population of the two conformations is highly dependent on the temperature and ionic strength of the solution (3). At 10 °C in the presence of 200 mM NaCl, Ltn is a monomer that adopts the conserved chemokine fold (Ltn10) (4). However, at 40 °C in the absence of salt, it switches to a dimeric four-stranded -sheet structure (Ltn40) completely distinct from other chemokines. Rearrangement to the Ltn40 structure involves unfolding of the canonical chemokine structure and assembly of a completely different secondary structure hydrogen bonding network (3). The receptor for Ltn, XCR1, has been cloned (5), and in vitro assays for XCR1 activation have been described previously (5, 6). While other chemokines display a strict requirement for specific residues at the N-terminus for receptor activation, similar studies on Ltn yielded ambiguous results (2, 7-9). In contrast, multiple reports (8, 10) describe an absolute functional requirement for the C-terminal extension of Ltn. Thus, it seems likely that Ltn binds and activates XCR1 in a novel manner relative to other chemokines. Our overall objective is to correlate the dual structures of lymphotactin with functional chemokine activities like glycosaminoglycan binding and receptor activation. Although we can shift the conformational equilibrium such that either

Lymphotactin Is Competent for Receptor Activation the Ltn10 or Ltn40 species predominates, it is technically challenging to conduct either in vitro or in vivo assays under such conditions. Moreover, the alternative conformation may not be completely absent, even at extremes of temperature and ionic strength. Variants of Ltn restricted to only one conformation would therefore be useful for the examination of the biological activity of each structural species. To this end, we constructed two Ltn variants that incorporate a second disulfide bond designed to prevent structural interconversion. Each protein retains the canonical chemokine structure observed for wild-type Ltn at 10 °C in 200 mM NaCl, and neither protein exhibits the conformational heterogeneity displayed by wild-type Ltn, even at elevated temperatures. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of one mutant has been determined by NMR. Functional studies indicate that the Ltn10 conformation is competent for receptor activation but requires a native N-terminus, while the novel C-terminal extension is entirely dispensable, contrary to previous reports. By restricting Ltn to a single conformation, we can begin to define the biological function of each structural species and the in vivo relevance of their unique interconversion. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression, Purification, and Mutagenesis. Recombinant human lymphotactin was expressed using a modified pQE30 vector (Qiagen), purified by metal affinity chromatography, and cleaved with TEV protease to remove the His8 affinity tag as previously described (11). The purity, identity, and molecular mass were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and NMR. To introduce cysteine substitutions or create amino-terminal variants Ltn(G-1VGSE), Ltn(G1GSE), and Ltn(A1GSE), site-directed mutagenesis was performed using pairs of complementary primers and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). To truncate Ltn at specific residues, Ltn was PCR amplified from the pQE30 vector using a 5 primer containing a StyI restriction site and a 3 primer containing a HindIII restriction site at the appropriate truncation position. PCR products were then cut with StyI and HindIII, gel purified, and ligated back into the pQE30 vector. All expression vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. Purified Ltn was frozen, lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C. Generation of NatiVe Ltn(1-93) by Cyanogen Bromide CleaVage. To accommodate proteolytic removal of the His8 affinity tag, the Ltn expression construct described above lacks the N-terminal Val residue, and the resulting protein therefore corresponds to Ltn(2-93). To generate an Ltn protein that retains the initial valine, codons for the GlyMet-Val tripeptide were inserted between the TEV protease cleavage site and the Ltn sequence, and the M63V and M72A amino acid substitutions were introduced into the same expression vector. Recombinant Ltn was then expressed and purified as described, resulting in Ltn containing the Nterminal sequence G-2M-1V1GSE. To remove the G-M dipeptide, lyophilized protein was resuspended in either 80% TFA or 6 M guanidine in 0.1 N HCl followed by an overnight treatment at room temperature with cyanogen bromide (CNBr). Complete cleavage of the G-M dipeptide was verified by MALDI-MS analysis. Residual CNBr and solvent components were removed from the protein sample

NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX 600 instrument equipped with a 1H, 15N, 13C Cyroprobe or a conventional 1H, 15N, 13C probe equipped with three axis gradients. NMR samples contained 90% H2O, 10% D2O, and 0.02% NaN3, with 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0). The temperature and NaCl concentration were varied as specified in the results. Complete 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments for CC3 [20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0)] were made at 25 °C using the following experiments: 15N-1H HSQC (12), 3D SE HNCA (13, 14), 3D SE HNCO (13, 15), 3D SE HN(CO)CA (13), 3D SE HNCACB, 3D SE HNCACO, 3D SE HCCONH, 3D 15N SE TOCSYHSQC (16), 3D SE C(CO)NH (17), 3D HCCH TOCSY (18), and two-dimensional (2D) 13C constant time HSQC (19). Heteronuclear 15N-1H NOE values were determined from an interleaved pair of 2D gradient sensitivity-enhanced correlation spectra of [U-15N]CC3 Ltn acquired with and without a 5 s proton saturation period (20). NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (21), and XEASY (22) was used for resonance assignments and analysis of NOE spectra. Structure Calculation and Analysis. A total of 1234 unique, nontrivial NOE distance constraints were obtained from 3D 15 N-edited NOESY-HQSC (23), 13C(aromatic)-edited NOESYHSQC, and 13C(aliphatic)-edited NOESY-HSQC (18) spectra (mix ) 80 ms). A total of 82 backbone and dihedral angle constraints (for residues 11-66) were generated from secondary shifts of the 1HR, 13CR, 13C , 13C, and 15N nucleus shifts using TALOS (24). Structures were generated in an automated manner using the NOEASSIGN module of the torsion angle dynamics program CYANA 2.1 (25), which produced an ensemble with high precision and few residual constraint violations that required minimal manual refinements. The 20 CYANA conformers with the lowest target function were subjected to a molecular dynamics protocol in explicit solvent (26) using XPLOR-NIH (27). Completely disordered residues 76-93 were not included in water refinement calculations; thus, the ensemble of CC3 NMR structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank contains only residues 1-75. In Vitro Calcium Flux Assay for XCR1 ActiVation. HEK 293 cells stably expressing XCR1 (6) were maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 500 µg/mL G418. Cells were plated at an initial density of 5 × 104 cells/ mL in T-75 flasks from frozen stocks. At confluency, cells were harvested using enzyme-free cell dissociation solution (Specialty Media), resuspended in culture media, and allowed to rest for 2 h under incubator conditions. After incubation, cells were centrifuged, washed twice in EBSSH buffer [26 mM HEPES, 125 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM glucose, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaH2PO4, and 0.2% BSA (pH 7.4)], and resuspended to a density of 4 × 106 cells/mL in 10 mL of EBSSH containing 2.5 mM probenecid and 50 µg of Fluo-3-AM (Molecular Probes). After being loaded for 1 h at room temperature, cells were washed twice with EBSSH containing probenecid and aliquoted at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/mL into Eppendorf tubes. Immediately before the assay, aliquots were spun down and resuspended in probenecid-free EBSSH buffer at a density of 106 cells/mL and transferred to a 3 mL fluorescence cuvette. Lympho-

RESULTS Ltn Undergoes a ReVersible Conformational Change. In addition to containing a single disulfide bond and an extended C-terminus, Ltn is a unique chemokine that exhibits structural heterogeneity under physiological solution conditions (150 mM NaCl and 37 °C) (3). Rearrangement from the canonical chemokine structure exhibited by Ltn at 10 °C (Ltn10) to a novel structure (Ltn40) can be directly observed in the onedimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectra by monitoring the chemical shift of the indole 1H 1 resonance of W55 as a function of temperature (Figure 1A). In Ltn10, W55 is part of the C-terminal R-helix buried within the hydrophobic core, corresponding to a chemical shift of 10.4 ppm. Unfolding of the helix accompanies the structural rearrangement to Ltn40, shifting the resonance of 1H 1 to 10.2 ppm as W55 becomes solvent-exposed. These signal intensities reflect the abundance of each species in solution. The relative 1H 1 peak height at 10.2 ppm (Ltn40) as a function of temperature and salt concentration is shown in Figure 1B. In the presence of 200 mM NaCl, the midpoint transition temperature is higher than in the absence of salt, demonstrating the ionic stabilization of the Ltn10 structure as previously observed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (3). Three other aspects are apparent from the 1D 1H NMR temperature series. First, the conformational rearrangement between Ltn10 and Ltn40 is a twostep process, with no evidence of stable intermediates. Second, the Ltn10 to Ltn40 rearrangement is freely reversible and is not affected by repeated temperature titrations. Third, and most importantly, under conditions where most biological assays are performed (25-37 °C), a significant concentration of both structural species would exist, as the equilibrium constant of the Ltn40 versus Ltn10 species is approximately 1 at 30 °C in the presence of salt. Generation of Ltn10-Restricted Ltn Proteins, CC1 and CC3. Ltn is a unique chemokine that contains only one of two conserved disulfide bonds. It is the first disulfide, located between the N-terminal region and 30s loop (loop connecting -strands 1 and 2), that is specifically missing in Ltn. To test the hypothesis that addition of a second disulfide bridge would stabilize the Ltn10 conformation, we designed two Ltn mutants with cysteine substitutions at positions corresponding to two different disulfide bonds in HCC-2 (Figure 2A). HCC-2 contains three disulfide bonds, two of which correspond to the typical pair found in all CC chemokines, while the unique third disulfide tethers the N-loop to the C-terminal helix (28). On the basis of a sequence alignment between Ltn and HCC-2 (36% identical sequences), the CC1 sequence was engineered to include a single-residue substitution in the N-terminus, T10C, and an insertion that places

FIGURE 1: Ltn exhibits a reversible structural rearrangement between two distinct structural species. (A) 1D 1H NMR spectra of wild-type Ltn [200 µM in 20 mM sodium phosphate and 200 mM NaCl (pH 6.0)] were acquired at various temperatures. During the Ltn10 to Ltn40 transition, Trp-55 moves from a buried position in the hydrophobic core of Ltn10 to a solvent-exposed, unstructured region of Ltn40, which is reflected in the chemical shift values for N-1H of 10.4 and 10.2 ppm for the Ltn10 and Ltn40 structures, respectively. The fractional population of Ltn10 and Ltn40 species can be assessed from the intensity of the 1H-N peak at 10.4 ppm vs 10.2 ppm. To demonstrate the reversibility of the conformational rearrangement, a spectrum reacquired at 10 °C following the temperature titration is illustrated after the 55 °C spectrum. (B) A plot of 1H-N peak intensity at 10.2 ppm vs temperature was conducted using wild-type Ltn in the absence (b) or presence (9) of 200 mM NaCl. Peak intensities have been normalized to the maximal intensity obtained after conversion to Ltn40 species. Trend lines were visually fit to the data to represent the shift in relative peak intensity after inclusion of salt to the protein sample.

an Ala-Cys dipeptide between Ltn residues G32 and S33, located within the 30s loop. It was our hypothesis that introduction of this missing disulfide back into Ltn (LtnCC1) may restrict Ltn to the Ltn10 conformation. However, we also considered the possibility that Ltn purposefully lacks this first disulfide as interactions or movements within the 30s loop may be critical for biological function. Therefore, we also wished to introduce the additional disulfide at a site that did not restrict the mobility of the 30s loop yet was also incompatible with the Ltn40 structure. This was accomplished by introducing a disulfide, modeled after the third disulfide in HCC-2, between the 310-helix and R-helix (LtnCC3). The second variant, CC3, was designed by aligning the NMR structures of Ltn10 (4) and HCC-2 (28) to identify the Ltn residues nearest to the third and sixth cysteine residues of HCC-2. By inspecting the overlaid structures, we found that V59 in Ltn occupies the position filled by

FIGURE 2: Introduction of a second disulfide bond in Ltn stabilizes the Ltn10 structure. (A) Placement of a second disulfide bond was based on alignment of Ltn with the CC chemokine, HCC-2. Construction of Ltn-CC1 (T10C/iG32ACS33) is based on alignment of the first disulfide in HCC-2, while the positions of cysteine substitutions in Ltn-CC3 (V21C/V59C) are based on the unusual third disulfide present in HCC-2. (B) 1H-15N HSQC spectra acquired for CC1 and CC3 at 40 °C are compared with those recorded for wild-type Ltn at 10, 37, and 40 °C. Spectra for the wild-type protein at 10 and 37 °C were acquired in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) containing 200 mM NaCl. Spectra of all other protein samples were acquired using 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) in the absence of salt. HSQC spectra of CC1 and CC3 Ltn resemble the patterns observed for Ltn10. Neither mutant displays evidence of a mixture of the two structural species as observed for the wild-type protein at 37 °C. The 1HN peak for Val56 is boxed in the WT spectra acquired at 10 °C and the CC1 and CC3 mutants. Because of ring current effects of W55, the proton chemical shift for Val56 is significantly upfield of other backbone amide protons and is indicative of the conserved chemokine fold. (C) Amide chemical shifts for the CC1 and CC3 mutants are plotted against the corresponding values for wild-type Ltn at 10 and 40 °C. The excellent correlation of the Ltn10 chemical shifts vs the disulfide-stabilized mutants as compared to the poor correlation with the Ltn40 chemical shifts indicates that CC1 and CC3 adopt the chemokine-like fold. Outliers in each plot are labeled and correspond to residues at or adjacent to the substituted position in the amino acid sequence. (D) 1D-1H spectra of Ltn-CC3 [1 mM in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0)] acquired at various temperatures demonstrates CC3 maintains the Ltn10 conformation with no evidence of conformational heterogeneity or Ltn40 species formation.

one of the HCC-2 cysteines and that the other cysteine residue corresponded to either P20 or V21 in Ltn. Because P20 is highly conserved in the chemokine family (including HCC-2) and might play an important structural role, we introduced V59C and V21C substitutions into Ltn to create the CC3 variant. Both Ltn disulfide variants were isotopically labeled with 15 N, purified, and evaluated by 2D NMR to determine if the

proteins exhibited characteristics of the Ltn10 fold (Figure 2B). At both 10 and 40 °C, each protein displayed a HSQC spectrum similar to that of Ltn10, including two characteristic upfield-shifted resonances. In the chemokine fold, a number of hydrophobic interactions involving a conserved aromatic residue position the helix with respect to the -sheet. Ring current effects from W55 produce unusual 1HN chemical shifts for L19 and V56 at 5.32 and 5.91 ppm in Ltn10,

(B) Ca2+ flux response of recombinant Ltn proteins containing either a +1 N-terminal sequence (G-1V1GSE-Ltn) or a substitution of the N-terminal valine with either a glycine or alanine compared with those of native N-terminal, Ltn(1-93) obtained from cyanogen bromide cleavage of the recombinant protein. All protein concentrations are 500 nM. (C) Alignment of Ltn protein sequences from various species indicates that the N-terminus exhibits more sequence variability compared to the C-terminus of Ltn orthologs. To accommodate CNBr treatment, methionine residues at positions 63 and 72 were substituted on the basis of sequence alignments with other Ltn proteins. Neither methionine is absolutely conserved; therefore, an M63V/M72A double mutant was generated.

respectively, and very similar values were observed for the same residues in CC1 and CC3. Because similarities between HSQC spectra are not always readily apparent, we compared chemical shift values of CC1 and CC3 with the corresponding values for Ltn10 and Ltn40 (Figure 2C). Strong correlations are observed for CC1 and CC3 with the Ltn10 chemical shifts but not with the Ltn40 assignments, indicating that both Ltn disulfide variants adopt the Ltn10 conformation. We also compared 1D 1H spectra of CC1 and CC3 at various temperatures (Figure 2D) with those of wild-type

Ltn. In contrast to wild-type Ltn (Figure 1A), the W55 1H 1 signal for CC3 did not shift from 10.4 to 10.2 ppm with an increase in temperature (Figure 2D). Even in the absence of salt (a condition which destabilizes the Ltn10 structure in wild-type Ltn), we found no evidence of conformational heterogeneity or formation of Ltn40 species as the temperature was increased. Similar results were obtained for CC1 (data not shown). Thus, CC1 and CC3 maintain the Ltn10 conformation and do not interconvert with the Ltn40 species, even under conditions that normally favor Ltn40.

Complete data from three independent data sets for the wild type and two independent data sets for CC3 were fit to determine EC50 values.

CC3 Adopts the Ltn10 Chemokine-like Fold. We determined the structure of CC3 by NMR spectroscopy at 25 °C. The final ensemble of 20 conformers (PDB entry 2HDM) is shown in Figure 3A, and a summary of the experimental restraints and structural statistics is provided in Table 1. Backbone rmsd (Figure 3B) and 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE (Figure 3C) values confirm that residues 1-10 and 69-93 are dynamically disordered in solution, as observed with the Ltn10 structure (4). As expected, CC3 adopts the chemokine fold and aligns closely with the Ltn10 NMR structure determined using the wild-type protein at 10 °C in 200 mM NaCl (Figure 3D). The CR rmsd between the Ltn10 and CC3 structures is 1.55 Å (residues 15-64). The additional disulfide in CC3 links the 310-loop (C21) and the C-terminal R-helix (C59), preventing CC3 from rearranging to the Ltn40 structure. The presence of a disulfide bond between C21 and C59 is supported by NOEs between the 1H proton of C21 and 1HR of V59. The NatiVe Ltn N-Terminus Is Required for XCR1 ActiVation. To assess the biological activity of the Ltn10-restricted proteins, we monitored intracellular Ca2+ levels in HEK293 cells expressing the XCR1 receptor. On the basis of a previous report (7) that a Ltn protein lacking the aminoterminal valine residue is biologically active, our expression system was designed to yield residues 2-93 of the mature Ltn sequence (G2SE- rather than V1GSE-), after cleavage of the His8 affinity tag by TEV protease (11). However, this Ltn(2-93) protein failed to induce a Ca2+ flux response,

while Ltn(1-93) from a commercial source and recombinant Ltn(1-93) used in our previous structural studies (4) both induced significant Ca2+ flux responses (Figure 4A). Therefore, before testing Ltn-CC1 and Ltn-CC3 for their ability to activate XCR1, we confirmed the importance of a native N-terminus to XCR1 agonist activity, producing a series of Ltn variants in which the N-terminal valine was substituted with alanine (A1GSE-) or glycine (G1GSE-), or prepended with an additional glycine (G-1V1GSE-). None of these alternative N-terminal variants gave a positive Ca2+ flux response as compared with the V1GSE-Ltn(1-93) controls (Figure 4B). On the basis of these results, Ltn displays a strict requirement for a native N-terminus for receptor activation. For high-level production of Ltn proteins with a native N-terminus, we developed a modified system employing cyanogen bromide cleavage. Since CNBr specifically cleaves the amide bond after methionine residues, we modified our expression system to include a methionine residue between the TEV protease cleavage site and the Ltn N-terminal valine. Human Ltn contains two internal methionine residues at positions 63 and 72, neither of which is strictly conserved among mammalian orthologs (Figure 4C). Methionine 63 is located in the R-helix but does not make significant structural contacts and was replaced with valine, while M72 in the unstructured C-terminal tail was substituted with alanine. After purification and digestion with TEV protease, the residual G-M dipeptide was removed by CNBr treatment to yield the native V1GSE N-terminus. The Ltn(M63V/M72A) double mutant behaved exactly like the wild-type Ltn(193) protein as determined by 1H-15N HSQC and Ca2+ flux measurements, suggesting that the methionine substitutions induce no significant structural or functional changes. The Chemokine Fold of Ltn10 Is Responsible for XCR1 ActiVation. To test the competence of the CC1 and CC3 variants for receptor activation as compared with wild-type Ltn, the same cysteine substitutions were introduced into the Ltn(M63V/M72A) background. The Ltn(M63V/M72A)-CC1 and Ltn(M63V/M72A)-CC3 proteins were purified using the CNBr cleavage protocol. Both proteins induced Ca2+ flux responses similar to that obtained for the Ltn(M63V/M72A) protein, which is reflected in the EC50 values and Hill coefficients determined for Ltn(M63V/M72A)-CC3 (75.8 ( 17.4 nM; Hill slope ) 1.1 ( 0.3) and Ltn(M63V/M72A) (128.1 ( 17.0 nM; Hill slope ) 1.1 ( 0.1) (Figure 5).

Tuinstra et al. Our previous structural studies utilized Ltn samples generated with a bacterial expression system that preserved the native N-terminal sequence (V1GSE) and is functional in a Ca2+ flux assay for XCR1 activation but suffered from nonspecific proteolysis by the factor Xa enzyme, employed for removal of the affinity tag (3, 4). On the basis of previous reports that addition or removal of an amino acid residue at the N-terminus had no effect on Ltn activity (2, 7, 8), we developed an improved bacterial expression system that incorporates an N-terminal His8 tag and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (11). The TEV protease recognition sequence consists of ENLYFQ/G (29), with cleavage occurring between the Q and G residues, and will tolerate certain amino acid substitutions, like serine or alanine, at the P1 site (30). We substituted the P1 amino acid with a valine residue to produce native Ltn(1-93), but TEV digestion failed; cleavable Ltn(2-93) protein (corresponding to the G2SE sequence at the N-terminus) was inactive in a Ca2+ flux assays at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 µM. Ultimately, we reengineered the expression system to use TEV protease digestion prior to protein refolding, followed by CNBr cleavage to expose the native N-terminal sequence. This scheme required substitution of two internal methionine residues (M63V and M72A); these substitutions did not alter the structural and biochemical properties of Ltn. Ltn(1-93)(M63A/M72A) produced using the cyanogen bromide protocol was indistinguishable by NMR spectroscopy and equally active in the Ca2+ flux assay as native Ltn(1-93). We have examined the ability of four N-terminal variant Ltn proteins to activate XCR1. Only the full-length protein, Ltn(1-93), containing the native N-terminal sequence (V1GSE) was competent in eliciting a Ca2+ flux. Although we have not examined every possible amino acid substitution, our data suggest a strong preference for valine as the N-terminal residue. These results are in contrast to previous studies that have used either +1 or -1 N-terminal variants. For instance, Kelner et al. (2) observed a positive Ca2+ flux and chemotactic response in CD4+-depleted, CD8+-enriched thymocytes using recombinant mouse Ltn(2-93), while two independent studies have reported +1 N-terminal variants of recombinant Ltn were functional (8, 9). Our results clarify the role of the Ltn N-terminus in XCR1 activation and show that additions, substitutions, or deletions abrogate its XCR1 agonist activity, like other chemokines. It should be noted that other investigators have reported negative chemotaxis and Ca2+ flux results even with wildtype Ltn(1-93) proteins. These results have been attributed to clonal differences in lymphocytes obtained from primary cultures. For instance, Dorner et al. (7) observed a differential response of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells taken from blood donors when either chemically synthesized Ltn(1-93) or naturally purified protein preparations of Ltn were used in parallel. Hedrick et al. (8) examined several human NK clones for their ability to respond to synthetic Ltn(1-93) in a chemotaxis assay. While some clones were found to respond very well, others showed little or no response to the same protein preparation. They speculated that the varying ability of human NK clones to respond to Ltn may reflect differences in receptor expression level or the relative mobility of particular clones. Alternatively, since these clones are maintained in culture by constant restimulation, they pos-

a Expected molecular masses were calculated from the primary sequence using the ProtParam tool on the ExPASy proteomics server (http://ca.expasy.org). b Observed molecular masses were determined from MALDI-MS analysis of purified proteins (Figure 6A).

The Disordered Ltn C-Terminus Is Not Required for XCR1 ActiVation. Previous reports ascribed a functional significance to the extended C-terminal Ltn sequence (10), but our structural studies on Ltn10 and CC3 showed that residues 70-93 are dynamically disordered in free solution (4). Therefore, we investigated the role of specific C-terminal residues in activating XCR1 by truncating Ltn after residues 53, 68, 72, 78, and 85 and assayed for Ca2+ flux activity. All C-terminal truncations were constructed on the M63V/ M72A background. Purified proteins were analyzed by MALDI-MS to confirm the purity and molecular mass for each truncated protein (Table 2 and Figure 6A). Aside from Ltn(1-53), all of the C-terminally truncated proteins produced a Ca2+ flux response comparable to that of wild-type Ltn (Figure 6B). Ltn(1-72), which includes residues of the R-helix, adopts the Ltn10 structure at 10 °C in 200 mM NaCl based on HSQC comparisons (Figure 6C). The only Cterminal truncation that failed to induce Ca2+ flux, Ltn(153), lacks the C-terminal R-helix (residues 54-68) and cannot form the Ltn10 structure on the basis of 1H-15N HSQC analysis (data not shown). Strikingly, instead of unfolding completely, it adopts the Ltn40 structure (Figure 6D). DISCUSSION Roles of N- and C-Terminal Regions in Receptor ActiVation. Chemokines function through interactions with their cognate receptor by a proposed two-step mechanism: an initial binding event, involving the N-terminus of the GPCR and the chemokine N-loop, followed by activation of the receptor through binding of the chemokine N-terminus. Published reports disagree on the extent to which specific Ltn N-terminal residues are necessary for receptor activation (2, 7-9). In addition, truncation of the last 22 residues resulted in a Ltn protein that did not trigger either a Ca2+ flux response in XCR1-transfected cells (10) or a chemotactic response from human peripheral blood lymphocytes and mouse splenocytes (8). Only four of the first 10 residues of the Ltn N-terminus are conserved among the sequences from human, rhesus, rat, and mouse, but the last seven C-terminal residues are absolutely conserved (Figure 4C). Taken together, these observations prompted us to consider a variation in the two-step model for chemokine receptor activation to explain the functional requirement for the unusual C-terminal extension in Ltn. In this model, the conserved chemokine fold of Ltn10 may bind to an extracellular binding site on XCR1 but employ the conserved C-terminus for receptor activation in contrast to the N-terminus as observed in most other chemokines.

FIGURE 6: Unstructured dynamically disordered C-terminus of Ltn is not required for activation of XCR1. (A) Recombinant Ltn proteins containing C-terminal truncations were constructed on the Ltn(M63V/M72A) background. Protein purities and expected molecular masses for each truncation mutant were verified by MALDI-MS. (B) Recombinant Ltn proteins containing C-terminal truncations were tested for their ability to induce a Ca2+ flux response. Addition of chemokine is indicated with dashed line. All protein concentrations were 200 nM. Only Ltn(1-53), which cannot adopt the Ltn10 structure, did not activate the Ltn receptor. (C) Comparison of 1H-15N HSQC spectra for wild-type Ltn and Ltn(1-72) proteins obtained at 10 °C in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 200 mM NaCl indicates that truncation of the last 22 residues does not affect maintenance of the Ltn10 structure. (D) Comparison of 1H-15N HSQC spectra for wild-type Ltn and Ltn(1-53) proteins obtained at 40 °C in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). While Ltn(1-53) does not achieve the chemokine fold, it does maintain some characteristics of the Ltn40 structure.

tulated the differential response may depend on how recently each clone had been stimulated. In contrast with previous reports (8, 10), data presented here indicate that the C-terminus of Ltn is not required for in vitro activation of XCR1. Except for Ltn(1-53), a series of C-terminally truncated Ltn variants all elicited a Ca2+ flux response. However, the structure of Ltn(1-53) is significantly altered, since residues of the C-terminal R-helix have been eliminated. Structural studies of Ltn10 indicate that the protein is disordered beyond residue 69 (4). Therefore, it is not unexpected that truncations did not significantly alter either the 15N-1H HSQC peak pattern or the ability of Ltn(1-72) to exhibit conformational exchange. In addition, the Ltn(1-68), Ltn(1-72), Ltn(1-78), and Ltn(1-85) truncations were also prepared on the CC3 background to generate Ltn10-restricted C-terminal truncations, and each of these generated a Ca2+ flux. It is not clear why other studies did not observe a functional response using Ltn(1-72) protein, especially given that Marcaurelle et al. (10) also reported that truncation of the last 22 residues did not alter the 15N1 H HSQC spectrum. Although it is possible that interactions with the receptor may induce secondary structure formation in C-terminal residues, they are not necessary for in vitro activation. It is interesting to note that Ltn from chicken does not contain the extended C-terminus, and the recombinant protein is biologically active (31). Without further studies, we cannot rule out the possibility that the C-terminus provides regulatory functions or a protein-protein interaction

surface that may be critical for in vivo function. Restriction of Protein Conformation by Site-Directed Mutagenesis. Ltn is the only chemokine to exhibit a dramatic conformational duality involving two entirely distinct tertiary structures. We hypothesized that introduction of a second disulfide bridge analogous to those found in other chemokine structures would stabilize the Ltn10 conformation and prevent interconversion with the novel Ltn40 species. We introduced cysteine residues corresponding either to the first disulfide found in all other chemokines or to the third disulfide seen in HCC-2 and selectively stabilized the Ltn10 conformation. The additional disulfide prevents interconversion between the Ltn10 and Ltn40 species because the new covalent cross-link is incompatible with the -sheet configuration of Ltn40. Therefore, the unique ability of Ltn to undergo structural rearrangement may be a simple consequence of the lack of a second conserved disulfide. It is noteworthy that the Ltn(1-53) species failed to induce any Ca2+ flux response and that this protein does not adopt the Ltn10 structure but instead displays a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum very similar to that of Ltn40 (Figure 6D). These data suggest that the Ltn40 structure is unlikely to function as an XCR1 agonist. A remaining question is what, if any, biological function(s) can be ascribed to the Ltn40 structure. Chemokines function through dual interactions with their cognate receptor(s) and extracellular glycosaminoglycans. Thus, it is possible that the Ltn40 structure provides an essential high-affinity GAG binding site for Ltn in vivo.

2572 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 10, 2007 By eliminating the Ltn40 structure, we demonstrated that the canonical chemokine fold adopted by the Ltn10 structure is sufficient for receptor activation in vitro and the resulting EC50 value for Ltn-CC3 (76 µM) is similar to that of the wild-type protein (128 µM). As shown in Figure 1B, the relative concentration of Ltn10 is 70% of the total wildtype Ltn concentration under conditions corresponding to the Ca2+ flux assay (25 °C and 150 mM NaCl). After correcting for the fraction of WT Ltn present as Ltn40, we determined the EC50 values for Ltn-CC3 and Ltn10 are indistinguishable, consistent with the hypothesis that the Ltn10 species is solely responsible for activation of XCR1 by Ltn. Although the additional disulfide in CC3 is not located at the same position as the first disulfide bridge found in all other chemokines (connecting the N-terminus and the 12, or 30s, loop), CC3 remained functional in the XCR1 activation assay. This engineered Ltn variant will be a useful tool for analysis of structure-activity relationships. For instance, in comparison with other chemokines, Ltn exhibits a more flexible 30s loop. Because the 30s loop is unaltered in CC3, we will be able to determine whether those residues participate in XCR1 binding or activation. Future studies will focus on the use of these conformationally restricted mutants to examine if a reversible structural rearrangement is a prerequisite to Ltn function in vivo, and what specific elements of Ltn10 structure are responsible for receptor binding and/or activation.
