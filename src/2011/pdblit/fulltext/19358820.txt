CK2 is a multifunctional kinase, involved in cell growth, apoptosis, DNA integrity preservation, viral infection, and many other biological processes. Based on an analysis of phosphopeptides database derived from phosphoproteomic studies we previously identified a list of potential new CK2 substrates, including, among others, Programmed Cell Death 5 (PDCD5), a protein involved in cell death and down-regulated in different forms of human tumors. Here we provide experimental evidence that PDCD5 is indeed a bona fide substrate of CK2. PDCD5 is phosphorylated in vitro by both CK2a subunit and by the CK2 holoenzyme at a residue, S118, which is found phosphorylated in vivo. We also show that PDCD5 is phosphorylated by CK2 in 293T cells. Transfection of the non-phosphorylatable mutant (S118A) impairs the PDCD5 acceleration of either doxorubimicin- or UV-induced apoptosis in U2OS cells. Our results suggest a functional link between the CK2 phosphorylation and the apoptotic potential of PDCD5. Ó 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction CK2 is a ubiquitous Ser/Thr kinase whose catalytic a subunit is essential for embryo survival at mid-gestation [1]. CK2 is deeply involved in cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, DNA integrity preservation, viral infection, and many other biological processes (see Ref. [2] and bibliography therein). Elevated CK2 expression has been found in a variety of human cancers, including mammary gland, prostate, lung, head and neck, kidney cancer, and leukemias [3]. A first oral active specific CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945; Cylene Pharmaceuticals) is actually in clinical Phase I development in patients with advanced solid tumors or multiple myeloma. The association of CK2 with malignancies has been mainly attributed to its antiapoptotic activity probably due to its involvement in different survival signaling pathways which have not been fully characterized [4]. Based on a previous analysis of phosphopeptide database derived from large scale phosphoproteomic studies we recently identified a list of putative new substrates of CK2, in addition to the many already previously known [5] that would allow a better comprehension of the molecular mechanisms of this pleiotropic kinase [6]. Among these, Programmed Cell Death 5 (PDCD5), a widely expressed and well-conserved protein among eukaryotic species, is a recently discovered protein related to regulation of apoptosis and down-regulated in several types of human tumors. PDCD5 (TFAR-

19, TF-1 cell apoptosis-related gene-19 was its original denomination) was first cloned as an upregulated gene from TF-1 cells undergoing apoptosis following serum withdrawn [7]. Its functional link with apoptosis was later confirmed by demonstrating that PDCD5 accelerates apoptosis in different type of cells in response to different stimuli [8­10] and is involved in different type of cell death as paraptosis-like cell death [11]. During the apoptotic process the protein translocates rapidly from the cytoplasm to the nucleus before the externalization of phosphatidilserine and the fragmentation of the DNA and in parallel with the mitochondrial membrane depolarization [12]. In this study, we provide clear-cut evidence that PDCD5 is a CK2 substrate both in vitro and in 293T cells and we show that the residue affected by CK2 (S118) is the same which is found phosphorylated in the phosphoproteome from mouse brain [13], liver [14], and from different cell lines (see PhosphoSitePlusTM, http://www. phosphosite.org, for a complete reference list).

50­60% confluence were transiently transfected with 2 lg of cDNA by standard calcium-phosphate procedure. The transfection mixture was removed after 6 h, and cell were lysed after further 48 h. U2OS cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. U2OS transfection was performed by using FuGENEÒ HD Transfection Reagent (Roche), according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA constructs. The pcDNA3.1-PDCD5-myc plasmid has been described previously [11]. S118A mutant was obtained with the QuickChange-Site directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutation was confirmed by sequencing analysis. For the preparation of the GST-PDCD5 plasmid, the DNA encoding full-length PDCD5 was amplified from pcDNA3.1-PDCD5-myc by polymerase chain reaction where EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites have been added to PCR primer and inserted into the pGEX4T1 vector at EcoRI and XhoI sites. Recombinant protein expression. BL-21 cells transformed with GST-PDCD5 were grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.5­0.6, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 and by sonication. After 30 min at 4 °C, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and incubated with glutathione­Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) for 4 h at 4 °C and extensively washed with PBS. GST-fusion protein was eluted in 80 mM Hepes (pH 8) and 10 mM GSH. GST-PDCD5 was further purified by gel-filtration chromatography. Recombinant CK2a and a2b2 were expressed and purified as described previously [15]. The activity of the enzymes measured on the peptide RRRADDSDDDDD is 1000 U/mg for CK2a in absence of NaCl) and 1500 U/mg for CK2a2b2 (in presence of 100 mM NaCl). Immunoprecipitation and in vitro phosphorylation. After treatment, cells were centrifuged, washed, and lysed by the addition of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and by sonication. After 20 min incubation on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. For immunoprecipitation, lysate proteins (0.3­0.4 mg) were incubated with the indicated antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and then with 35 lL of protein GPLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) beads for 1 h. Beads were washes three times with PBS and one time with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5). Beads were then incubated in the kinase buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 lM ATP, [c-33P]ATP or [c-32P]ATP, 10 mM Mg2+), in absence (control) or with CK2a or in the kinase buffer supplemented with 100 mM NaCl in absence or presence of CK2a2b2 at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2Â Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS/PAGE and blotted on PVDF where indicated.

For the identification of the amino acids phosphorylated by CK2 in PDCD5, phosphorylation sample was hydrolyzed by incubation for 4 h at 110 °C in 6 N HCl, following subjected to high-voltage paper electrophoresis at pH 1.9 for 2.5 h, in the presence of nonradioactive phosphoamino acids as migration reference. In cell phosphorylation. Cells transfected with either wild-type PDCD5-myc or S118A were lysed after 48 h and proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above with the addition in lysis buffer of the phosphatase inhibitor Cocktail I and II (Sigma) to preserve the endogenous level of phosphorylation. For CK2a downregulation, 24 h prior PDCD5-myc transfection, cells were transfected with CK2a-specific siRNA (siRNA sequence targeting specifically human CK2a containing 21-nt with (20 -deoxy)-tymidine 30 overhangs and corresponding to nucleotides 803­823, Accession No. AY112721, synthesized and annealed by Qiagen-Xeragon Inc.) or non-silencing siRNA (Qiagen) by Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Before lysis, indicated cells were pre-treated for 2 h with 20­40 lM TBB (kindly provided by Prof. Z. Kazimierczuk, Warsaw, Poland) or 15 lM Quinalizarin (Produits Chimiques ACP Chemicals Inc. Montreal, Canada) or with DMSO alone (control). Immunoprecipitated were resolved by one-dimensional SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were Western blotted on PVDF and revealed with anti-pSer and anti-myc antibody or were directly stained with Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel staining (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by Colloidal Coomassie staining for total proteins. Pro-Q-Diamond staining was visualized using the ChemiDoc System (Bio-Rad). Apoptosis detection. U2OS cells were transfected with either PDCD5 wild-type or PDCD5 S118A. 24 h later, cells were treated by 1 lg/mL of doxorubicin (Doxo, Sigma) for 12 h. UV irradiation (20 J/m2) was performed using a UV crosslinker (Upland, USA). Then treated cells were trypsinized, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended in 200 lL binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2). FITCconjugated AnnexinV was added to a final concentration of 0.5 lg/mL, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Beijing Biosea, China). After 20 min incubation at room temperature in the dark, 400 lL of binding buffer was added, and samples were immediately analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton­ Dickinson, USA). Results and discussion Based on a previous analysis of in vivo generated phosphopeptides identified by large scale phosphoproteomic studies, we extracted a list of new potential substrates of protein kinase CK2 [6]. Among these, PDCD5 looked of particular interest because of its role in apoptotic and other forms of cell death processes and its downregulation in different human tumors. The identified phosphosite is S118 (see Fig. 1) located in the C-terminal region whose surrounding sequence fit very well with the web-logo rep-

resentation of the CK2 bona fide substrates (see Ref. [6]). CK2 in fact, unlike most Ser/Thr kinases that fall in the categories of basophilic (PKA, PKC, CaM-kinases, etc.) and Pro-directed enzymes, is characterized by a markedly acidic consensus sequence, whose minimum requirement is an acidic residue at position n + 3 respect to the target amino acid. Additional acidic residues at positions spanning from À2 to +7 also act as positive specificity determinants for CK2 [16]. PDCD5 S118 and the acidic cluster close to it (in particular at position from À1 to +3) are conserved across eukaryotes implying a key role for this site and consequently for its posttranslational modification in the structure/function of the protein. In fungi, the Ser residue is replaced by a ``conserved" acidic residue and the acidic cluster is conserved as well. In Archea, the Cterminal tail is lacking, suggesting that this portion of the molecule has been inserted during evolution for some specific function linked to increased organism complexity (see Fig. 1). Based on these assumptions, we have expressed PDCD5-myc in 293T cells, immunoprecipitated it with an anti-myc antibody and

subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by recombinant CK2a in the presence of [c-32]ATP. As illustrated in Fig. 2A myc-PDCD5 is efficiently phosphorylated by CK2a (lane 3), In contrast, no phosphorylation of PDCD5 was observed both with the empty vector control (lane 1) and when CK2a was omitted from the reaction mixture (lane 2). Phosphoaminoacidic analysis shows that the target of CK2 phosphorylation is/are Ser residue/s. To characterize the kinetic of phosphorylation the recombinant protein GST-PDCD5 has been produced. Fig. 2B reports a comparative PDCD5 phosphorylation by the monomeric CK2a and the terameric CK2a2b2 form. GST-PDCD5 is phosphorylated to similar extent by the two forms, consistent with the view that the b subunit is not required for PDCD5 recognition. Kinetics of phosphorylation by CK2a (Fig. 2C) reveal a Km value of 130 ± 26 nM, comparable to other physiological CK2 substrates [6]. Similar Km value is obtained using the holoenzyme (not shown). An exhaustive phosphorylation of PDCD5 (Fig. 2D) is consistent with the existence of an individual phosphorylation site. Next we used a mutational approach to con-

Fig. 2. PDCD5 is phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro. (A) HEK 293T cells were transfected with vector alone or with wild-type PDCD5-myc. PDCD5-myc was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate as described above and incubated in radioactive mixture, [c-32P]ATP ($2000 cpm/pmol), in the absence (lane 2) or in the presence (lanes 3) of 20 ng of CK2a. Myc immunoprecipitation from cells transfected with the empty vector is also incubated in the radioactive mixture in presence of CK2a (lane 1).

firm the hypothesis that S118 is the target of CK2. We transfected 293T cells with empty vector, wild-type PDCD5-myc and S118A PDCD5-myc. Proteins were then immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation. As observed in Fig. 2E wild-type PDCD5 is phosphorylated by CK2a while the mutated S118A is refractory to phosphorylation. S118 is therefore the main if not the only target site of CK2, at least in vitro. These results prompted us to investigate whether protein kinase CK2 is also responsible for the phosphorylation of PDCD5 in living cells. First, we checked the endogenous phosphorylation status of immunoprecipitated PDCD5 by an anti-phosphoserine antibody. Proteins were immunoprecipitated in presence of a cocktail of phosphatases inhibitors, to preserve the endogenous status of phosphorylation, Western blotted and analyzed by anti-pSer, followed by anti-myc antibody as loading control. As shown in Fig. 3A, the phosphorylation of PDCD5 is completely abrogated as a result of mutating S118 to alanine. This shows that, in cells, S118 is the only or at least the by far predominant phosphosite in PDCD5. PDCD5 phosphorylation is also reduced following pretreatment of 293T cells with 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB), a CK2 specific inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Implication of CK2 was also confirmed by RNA interference specific downregulation. Pre-treatment of 293T cells with siRNA for CK2a leads to a strong decrease in PDCD5 phosphorylation as revealed by anti-phosphoserine antibody (Fig. 3B). In a successive assay, cells transfected with PDCD5-myc were incubated either in the absence or presence of TBB, proteins were

immunoprecipitated in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and subjected to phosphorylation by recombinant CK2a. As shown in Fig. 3C, pre-incubation with TBB rendered PDCD5 more prone to phosphorylation, as expected assuming that a larger number of molecules were in the non-phosphorylated state because of the inhibition of endogenous CK2. These data were also confirmed by a different method to detect the phosphorylation on immunoprecipitated PDCD5: i.e., staining with the fluorescent phosphosensor dye Pro-Q Diamond [17]. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by one-dimensional SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorescently stained with ProQ-Diamond and imaged to reveal phosphorylation levels followed by staining with Colloidal Coomassie as loading control. Fig. 3D confirms that S118 is the major site of PDCD5 phosphorylation in cells (no Pro-Q-Diamond staining is observable in the S118A mutant). Cells pre-treatment with two different and structurally unrelated CK2 inhibitors, TBB, and Quinalizarin [18] reduces the endogenous phosphorylation level in S118 of PDCD5. Collectively taken these data leave no doubt that CK2 is responsible for in vivo phosphorylation of PDCD5 at S118. Finally, we wanted to compare the functional consequences of transfecting PDCD5 wild-type and its non-phosphorylatable mutant (S118A). Plasmids transfected U2OS cells were treated with doxorubicin (Doxo) and UV irradiation. Apoptotic activity was monitored by FITC­Annexin V staining. As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of PDCD5 wild-type, but not of PDCD5 mutant S118A, significantly enhanced Doxo- or UV-induced apoptosis in U2OS cells

Fig. 4. PDCD5 S118A mutant impairs apoptosis-promoting activity. U2OS cells were transfected with vector alone, wild-type PDCD5-myc (PDCD5 wt), or S198A PDCD5-myc (PDCD5 mt). After 24 h, they were treated with 1 lg/mL of doxorubicin (Doxo) for 12 h or UV-irradiated for indicated time. Then, cells were stained with FITC­AnnexinV and the percentage of apoptosis was determined. The data shown are from a representative experiment, each performed at least in triplicate.

as compared with control vector. This was indicated by the increase of AnnexinV-positive cells. These data may suggest that phosphorylation of PDCD5 by CK2 enhances its proapoptotic efficacy. This would be in contrast with the general assumption that CK2 invariably plays an antiapoptotic role, nevertheless it is to point out that the molecular mechanisms of PDCD5 action are almost unknown. Further in depth studies will be necessary to better explore the role of PDCD5 phosphorylation by CK2, once clearer information on PDCD5 cellular functions will became available.
