Macrocyclic Aminopyrimidines as Multitarget CDK and VEGF-R Inhibitors with Potent Antiproliferative Activities
Ulrich Lücking,*[a] Gerhard Siemeister,[b] Martina Schäfer,[c] Hans Briem,[d] Martin Krüger,[a] Philip Lienau,[e] and Rolf Jautelat[a]
X-ray structures from CDK2­aminopyrimidine inhibitor complexes led to the idea to stabilize the active conformation of aminopyrimidine inhibitors by incorporating the recognition site into a macrocyclic framework. A modular synthesis approach that relies on a new late-stage macrocyclization protocol that enables fast and efficient synthesis of macrocyclic aminopyrimidines was developed. A set of structurally diverse derivatives was prepared. Macrocyclic aminopyrimidines were shown to be multitarget inhibitors of CDK1/2 and VEGF-RTKs. In addition, potent antiproliferative activities toward various human tumor cells and a human tumor xenograft model were demonstrated.

Introduction
Protein kinases (PKs) belong to the enzyme family of transferases. They catalyze the transfer of a phosphoryl group from a donor to an acceptor. Generally, PKs are divided into two major groups: serine/threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases. PKs are considered to be among the most important regulators of cell behavior. They are especially important in sending signals between and within cells and in orchestrating complex functions like cell division and apoptosis. Mutations and deregulation of PKs play roles in many human diseases. Therefore, PKs have become attractive targets in drug-discovery programs for a variety of indications such as cancer, immune diseases, and diabetes. It is estimated that about 30 % of all research spending on drug development nowadays is focused on PKs.[1] Loss of cell-cycle control, increased resistance to apoptosis, and tumor-induced neovascularization represent major hallmarks of cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are serine/ threonine kinases that require association with a cyclin regulatory subunit for activation and are required for the correct timing and order of the events of the cell division cycle. Aberrant CDK control and consequent loss of cell-cycle checkpoint function have been directly linked to the molecular pathology of cancer.[2­4] Tumor-induced neovascularization was identified as a crucial mechanism to achieve blood supply for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. The endothelial cell-specific vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (VEGF-RTK) system has been validated as a main signaling pathway in tumor angiogenesis.[5] Herein we report the identification and optimization of macrocyclic aminopyrimidines as a new class of multitarget CDK and VEGF-RTK inhibitors with potent antiproliferative activities. We describe the circumstances that initiated our ongoing leadoptimization program on macrocyclic PK inhibitors, starting

from a non-macrocyclic high-throughput screen (HTS) hit with moderate biological activities. The process of lead optimization by a collaborative effort of medicinal chemistry and structural biology is highlighted. In addition, a modular synthesis approach that relies on a new macrocyclization protocol that enables fast and efficient synthesis of macrocyclic aminopyrimidines is described.

Search for low-molecular-weight CDK inhibitors CDKs are considered to be the key drivers of a cell through the cell division cycle. Upon mitogenic stimulation of a cell, cyclin D is induced and activates CDK4/6 to enter G1 phase of the cell cycle. In G1, CDK2­cyclin E is activated and both CDK2 and CDK4/6 inactivate the retinoblastoma protein through phosphorylation. Once retinoblastoma protein is inactivated, the cell is committed to cell division (the restriction point has

been passed) and it enters S phase. After completion of DNA synthesis (duplication of the genome), the cell enters G2 phase, and CDK1­cyclin B is activated to drive the cell into mitosis (M phase). CDK-related alterations such as overexpression and amplification of cell-cycle activators or inactivation of cell cycle inhibitors are among the most common genetic changes in human tumors. CDK inhibitors that prevent tumor cells from uncontrolled cycling have considerable potential as cancer therapeutics.[2, 6] Therefore, the aim at Schering AG and other companies has been the identification of a low-molecular-weight CDK inhibitor for cancer therapy. A HTS of the Schering compound collection led to the identification of the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative 1, which has potent inhibitory properties against CDK1 (IC50 = 100 nm) and CDK2 (IC50 = 100 nm) and moderate antiproliferative activity in vitro toward the MCF7 cancer cell line (IC50 = 4000 nm, Table 1). This prompted us to initiate chemistry to explore the activity of this class of compounds against CDK1 and CDK2.

macrocyclic framework, thus taking advantage of the lower entropic penalty upon complex formation in contrast to that paid by a more flexible analogue.[7] Because macrocyclic aminopyrimidines were not reported in the literature, it was decided to synthesize macrocycle 2 as a model compound in which the macrocycle is formed over the 2- and 4-positions (Figure 1). Our retrosynthetic analysis of the target molecule 2 suggested the formation of a macrocyclic ether by Mitsunobu reaction[8­11] as a key step. The required open-chain precursor 5 was easily accessible by established chemistry (Scheme 1). Starting from commercial building block 3, the 4-position was first functionalized under basic conditions to give 4. Then the substituent in the 2-position was introduced under acidic conditions to give 5. The crucial Mitsunobu reaction was performed under high dilution conditions,[12, 13] and product 2 was isolated in an non-optimized 17 % yield. Macrocycle 2 indeed possessed biological activities (Table 1). In vitro IC50 values in the micromolar range were recorded for

Results and Discussion
Structural variation of the HTS hit The following process of lead optimization was supported right from the start by structural biology and computational chemistry efforts. The 3D structure of lead compound 1 in complex with CDK2 was determined by co-crystallization. The corresponding X-ray structure (Figure 1) was used as a model for further structural variations of the aminopyrimidine lead 1, based on the assumption that the binding mode observed in vitro is somehow similar to the one in vivo. One suggestion was to stabilize the bioactive conformation of inhibitor 1 by incorporating the aminopyrimidine recognition region into a

Macrocyclic Aminopyrimidines as CDK and VEGF-R Inhibitors the inhibition of CDK2 (IC50 = 2400 nm) and for the antiproliferative activity toward MCF7 cells (IC50 = 4000 nm). Therefore, it was decided to take a closer look at the possibility of macrocyclic aminopyrimidines as CDK inhibitors. About that time, we found that the introduction of a parasulfonamide moiety to the aromatic group in the 2-position of non-macrocyclic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives resulted in a significant improvement in the CDK inhibitory properties and antiproliferative activities of this type of inhibitor. For compound 1 a (Figure 2), for instance, IC50 values in the nanomolar

range were recorded toward CDK2 (IC50 = 40 nm) and against MCF7 cells (IC50 = 450 nm) (Table 1). Co-crystallization experiments revealed that the sulfonamide group appears to form three additional hydrogen bonds with the enzyme in vitro (Figure 2). Similar results were reported later by others.[14, 15] Our findings motivated us to introduce a sulfonamide moiety to the macrocyclic framework, and we designed two types of sulfonamide macrocycle: the so-called type I compound 6 has the sulfonamide in the meta position, and the sulfonamide is incorporated into the macrocycle; the so-called type II compound 7, however, has the sulfonamide in the para position.

In our first synthetic approach to sulfonamide 7 we tried to functionalize macrocycle 2 further via chlorosulfonation and subsequent reaction with amines (Scheme 2). A test reaction

resulted in a complex mixture, however, from which only the disubstituted product 8 was isolated in 10 % yield. Synthetic alternatives were needed. In our initial retrosynthetic analysis we had disconnected the molecule at the macroether position. The required Mitsunobu reaction worked but proved to be quite laborious in terms of purification. In our second retrosynthetic analysis, we speculated about the possibility of disconnecting the molecule at the carbon­nitrogen bond in the 2-position. In the syntheses of the nonmacrocyclic 2,4-diaminopyrimidines the substituent in the 2position was introduced under acidic conditions. We therefore anticipated that an open-chain precursor like compound 12 should have a chance to cyclize under similar conditions (Scheme 3). Starting from building block 9, intermediate 10 was synthesized by standard chemistry. The sulfonamide moiety was introduced by chlorosulfonation and subsequent reaction with ammonia. In this case, the desired product 11 was isolated in 40 % yield. A second regioisomer with the sulfonamide in the para position with respect to the ether group was isolated in 23 % yield. Reduction of the nitro group of sulfonamide 11 in the presence of the bromine substituent in the 5-position was accomplished using titaniumACHTUNGRE(III) chloride. The corresponding open-chain precursor 12 was dissolved and slowly added by syringe pump to an acidic acetonitrile solution at reflux. The reaction was heated overnight, and the desired product 7 was isolated in 87 % yield. Because our new macrocyclization procedure had been very successful in the synthesis of sulfonamide 7, the same strategy was applied to the synthesis of type I compound 6 (Scheme 4). Starting from building block 3 the central intermediate 13 was prepared in two steps. The sulfonamide moiety was formed by reaction with commercially available 3-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride. After aqueous workup, the crude product was reduced with titaniumACHTUNGRE(III) chloride to give linear sulfonamide 15, which was finally cyclized to 6 under acidic conditions. By this procedure we were able to generate the desired product 6 in five steps with only one chromatographic purification in an overall yield of 37 %. Compounds 6 and 7 had much better CDK1/2 inhibitory properties (Table 1). The high activity of type I compound 6 was especially surprising to us, because the sulfonamide was not in the para but in the meta position, and therefore should

address a different binding mode with CDK2. Both compounds had greatly improved antiproliferative activities toward MCF7 cells as well. Compounds 6 and 7 were screened against a panel of different kinases to determine their kinase selectivities. Interestingly, both new compounds proved to be strong inhibitors of the VEGF receptor 2 tyrosine kinase. This result was very exciting, as the VEGF/VEGF receptor system is another validated target in cancer therapy. Angiogenesis inhibitors are designed to stop a tumor from develop-

ing a blood supply, which is a critical step for tumor growth and metastasis. VEGF is a specific angiogenesis growth factor that binds to the corresponding VEGF receptors on blood vessels and stimulates the formation of new blood vessels. To stop this growth, the signal cascade between tumor cells and the cells on the blood vessels must be interrupted, for instance, by a VEGF receptor inhibitor.[16, 17] Compounds 6 and 7 displayed a multitargeted mode of action in vitro. Owing to their CDK inhibitory properties, they

Macrocyclic Aminopyrimidines as CDK and VEGF-R Inhibitors should have the potential to block the cell cycle and induce apoptosis. Furthermore, they appeared to inhibit the VEGF receptor 2 tyrosine kinase and should therefore have the potential to block the formation of new blood vessels, leading to tumor cell starvation and apoptosis. With these interesting results in hand we went forward to perform the first in vivo experiment with macrocyclic aminopyrimidine 6. Dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth was recorded after daily oral application in the HeLa-MaTu human cancer xenograft model.[18] With daily doses of 50 or 100 mg kgÀ1 animal body weight, tumor growth was slowed significantly (Figure 3).

Oral treatment with 6 was started on day 3, when tumors had reached a size of approximately 20 mm2, and this monotherapy was carried out once daily. (100 mg kgÀ1 p.o. (*); 50 mg kgÀ1 p.o.

Lead optimization of macrocyclic aminopyrimidines After proof of concept in vitro and in vivo, we decided to prepare a set of explorative macrocyclic aminopyrimidine derivatives to get further insight into the SAR. The general structure was examined again, and several positions of interest for further modifications were identified. We became especially interested in the tethering side chain between the 2- and 4-positions, the 4-position itself, the aromatic group in the 2-position, and finally the connection to the tether. Our selection was guided by a successful co-crystallization experiment that revealed the binding mode of 6 to CDK2 in vitro (Figure 4). The aminopyrimidine recognition site that we had incorporated into a macrocyclic framework was shown to bind to the hinge region of CDK2 through two hydrogen bonds, similar to the binding mode of HTS hit 1. Surprisingly, the sulfonamide in the meta position appears to address a unique new binding mode to CDK2: one oxygen atom of the meta-sulfonamide appears to form two hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogen and a side chain oxygen of Asp 86; an additional interaction of the amide nitrogen atom of this group is found to the backbone carbonyl group of Ile 10. Because sulfonamide derivatives 6 and 7 revealed potent antiproliferative activities, further modifications of the sulfonaChemMedChem 2007, 2, 63 ­ 77

mide moiety were initiated. The synthesis of compound 20 with an inverted sulfonamide group was carried out using our new macrocyclization strategy. In the key step of the corresponding synthesis, open-chain precursor 19 was deprotected and cyclized in one step to give the desired product 20 in 63 % yield (Scheme 5). In vitro, compound 20 showed IC50 values in the micromolar range in biochemical and cellular assays (Table 1). Another interesting position for structural modifications is the aromatic group in the 2-position. The synthesis of the amino analogue 25 started from the published compound 21,[19] which was transformed in three steps to intermediate 22. The first nitro group was reduced with titaniumACHTUNGRE(III) chloride, and the corresponding amino derivative 23 was cyclized under acidic conditions to give the nitro derivative 24. Finally, the remaining nitro group was reduced to give the desired amino analogue 25 (Scheme 6). Gratifyingly, macrocyclic sulfonamides 24 and 25 were both shown to be potent CDK and VEGF receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Both compounds revealed considerable antiproliferative activities in MCF7 cells (Table 1). Exchange of the phenyl group in the 2-position with bioisosteric heteroaryl groups was also tried. The synthesis of thiophenyl analogue 29 (Scheme 7) used central building block 26, which was treated with a mixture of 4- and 5-nitrothiophene2-sulfonyl chlorides, prepared by nitration of commercial thiophene-2-sulfonyl chloride. As the resulting mixture of regioisomers 27 was not separable by column chromatography, we continued directly with the reduction. Using titaniumACHTUNGRE(III) chloride, only the desired 4-amino derivative 28 was isolated and was finally cyclized under acidic conditions to give compound 29 in 62 % yield. Thiophene 29 displayed potent CDK inhibitory properties and potent antiproliferative activities toward MCF7 cells (Table 1). Another position of interest for lead optimization was the 4position of the aminopyrimidine scaffold. The corresponding oxa and thia derivatives were envisaged. For the synthesis of the oxa derivative 34 (Scheme 8), building block 31 was generated and introduced to the 4-position of the pyrimidine scaf-

The corresponding 4-thia derivative 35 was synthesized in a similar fashion. Oxa derivative 34 revealed IC50 values in the nanomolar range against the enzymes but had micromolar activities toward MCF7 cells. However, thia derivative 35 displayed potent multitarget inhibitory properties against CDK1/2 and VEGR-receptor 2 tyrosine kinase and potent antiproliferative activity toward MCF7 cells (Table 1).

The introduction of further functional groups to the tether between the 2- and 4-positions was accomplished by our modular synthesis approach. In the synthesis of hydroxy analogue 40 the published procedure by Borthwick et al. was used to get hold of the orthogonally protected building block 37.[20] In this procedure, the amino acid moiety of 36 was temporarily protected via formation of a copper complex, the benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) group was introduced, and the copper complex was destroyed afterward with EDTA. Finally, the tert-butoxycar-

bonyl (Boc) group was introduced, and the desired material was isolated in 72 % overall yield. Further protecting-group manipulations and coupling reactions gave intermediate 39. Reduction and macrocyclization under acidic conditions generated the desired molecule in good yield (Scheme 9). In vitro, macrocycle 40 inhibited CDK1/2 and VEGF receptor 2 tyrosine kinase in the lower nanomolar range and revealed moderate antiproliferative activity against MCF7 cells (Table 1).

U. Lücking et al. In the type II series, the introduction of additional functional groups to the tether between the 2- and 4-positions was also attempted. In the synthesis of compound 45, the protected sulfonamide derivative 42 was prepared first and was coupled to the tether via Mitsunobu reaction to give compound 43. The Boc group was cleaved, and the amine was coupled to the pyrimidine. Reduction and cyclization finally led to the desired compound 45 in very good yield (Scheme 10). Macrocycle 45 revealed similar in vitro properties as 7 (Table 1).

Macrocyclic Aminopyrimidines as CDK and VEGF-R Inhibitors

Summary
Macrocyclic aminopyrimidines have been shown to be strong inhibitors of CDK1/2 and VEGF receptor 2 tyrosine kinase. These novel multitarget PK inhibitors display strong antiproliferative activities against MCF7 human breast tumor cells in vitro. In addition, compound 6 has demonstrated dose-dependant antiproliferative activity in vivo after oral exposure using a hormone-independent MaTu human breast tumor xenograft model. Both discovery and lead optimization of this novel class of antiproliferative agent have relied strongly on crystal structures of aminopyrimidine inhibitors in complex with CDK2. The new binding mode of compound 6 with CDK2 was revealed by co-crystallization experiments. We have shown the positions of interest in our ongoing lead-optimization program of macrocyclic aminopyrimidines as multitarget CDK1/2 and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and have also disclosed the SAR of an explorative set of compounds. The process of lead optimization was strongly supported by our modular synthesis approach of macrocyclic aminopyrimidines that relies on a new macrocyclization procedure, which enables the fast and efficient synthesis of these interesting compounds. Further results of our investigations into this fascinating class of molecules will be reported in due course.

ter (Wallac, Germany). Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of CDK2­cyclin E activity was determined as the inhibitor concentration that gives 50 % substrate phosphorylation between maximal substrate phosphorylation in the presence of solvent and background phosphorylation in the presence of inactivated CDK2. VEGF-R2: GST-tagged recombinant human VEGF-R2 kinase domain purified from SF-9 cells was incubated for 10 min at 22 8C in the presence of different concentrations of test compounds in a TrisHCl assay buffer (40 mL, 40 mm, pH 7.5, MgCl2 (10 mm), MnCl2 (1 mm), dithiothreitol (1.0 mm), PEG 20 000 (0.025 % v/v), ATP (8 mm), g-[33P]ATP (0.2 mCi per well), polyACHTUNGRE(Glu4Tyr)n (24 ng mLÀ1, Sigma­Aldrich, Germany), dimethyl sulfoxide (1.25 % v/v)). The reaction was stopped by the addition of a solution of EDTA in water (0.25 m, 15 mL, pH 7.5). A quantity (15 mL) of each reaction mixture was transferred to P30 filter sheets (Wallac, Germany), washed with phosphorous acid (0.5 %, 3  10 min), and subjected to scintillation counting with MeltiLex A scintillator sheets (Wallac, Germany) and a Micobeta counter (Wallac, Germany). Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of VEGF-R2 kinase activity was determined as the inhibitor concentration that gives 50 % substrate phosphorylation between maximal substrate phosphorylation in the presence of solvent and background phosphorylation in the presence of inactivated VEGFR2 kinase. MCF7 cell proliferation assay: MCF7 cells (ATCC, USA) were seeded in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrome, Germany) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10 %, PAA, Austria), l-glutamine (2 mm), estradiol (0.1 nm), and insulin (1 U mLÀ1) at 5000 cells per well in 96-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h, and then fresh growth medium plus compounds were added. The final concentration of the solvent DMSO was 0.5 %. After 4 days of continuous incubation, the cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal violet, and the absorbance was recorded at l = 595 nm. All measurements were performed in quadruplicate. The values were normalized to the absorbance of solvent-treated cells (= 100 %), and the absorbance of a reference plate which was fixed at the time point of compound application (= 0 %). Half-maximal growth inhibition (IC50) was determined as the compound concentration required to achieve 50 % inhibition of cellular growth. HeLa-MaTu tumor model: HeLa-MaTu cells, obtained from Epo GmbH (Berlin, Germany), were originally described as MaTu human mammary carcinoma cells.[18] Analysis of cellular markers identified the cells as a subclone of HeLa human cervix carcinoma cells (unpublished results). HeLa-MaTu cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrome, Germany) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum (PAA, Austria). Female NMRI nude mice with a body weight of approximately 22 g each was given a s.c. implant of 1.5  106 MaTu mammary carcinoma cells suspended in 50 % Matrigel/50 % culture medium (without fetal calf serum) in the inguinal region of the mice. Tumors were allowed to grow to the predetermined size of approximately 20 mm2, at which point the animals were evenly distributed to treatment and control groups. Treatment was started and continued until the untreated control group had to be euthanized as a result of large tumor size. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight. Tumor response by the measurement of tumor area (product of the longest diameter and its perpendicular) with a caliper and body weight were determined twice a week. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with national guidelines (Animal protection law).

After 16 h, the reaction mixture is concentrated in vacuo, and the remaining residue is purified by chromatography (dichloromethane/EtOH 95:5). 152 mg (0.27 mmol, 60 % yield) of the product is obtained. 1H NMR ([D6]DMSO): d = 8.28 (s, 1 H), 8.19 (s, 1 H), 8.04 (m, 1 H), 7.89 (m, 2 H), 7.18 (d, 1 H), 4.89 (t, 1 H), 4.21 (m, 3 H), 3.51 (m, 2 H), 3.19 (s, 3 H), 2.89 (s, 3 H), 1.78 ppm (m, 4 H); ESMS (m/z): 565. (R)-15-Bromo-8-(hydroxymethyl)-4-oxa-2,9-diaza-1ACHTUNGRE(2,4)-pyrimidina-3ACHTUNGRE(1,3)-benzenacyclononaphane-34-sulfonamide (45): A solution of TiCl3 (2.0 mL, approx. 10 % in 20­30 % HCl) is added to a stirred solution of (R)-2-[4-(5-bromo-2-chloropyrimidin-4-ylamino)-5-hydroxypentyloxy]-N-dimethylaminomethylene-4-nitrobenzenesulfonamide (44) (145 mg, 0.30 mmol) in 20 mL THF under argon at room temperature. After 2 h, another 0.3 mL TiCl3 solution is added, and the reaction mixture is stirred for another 18 h. The reaction mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate and made basic by the addition of 1 n NaOH. The phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted again with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The remaining residue is purified by chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol 9:1). 90 mg (0.17 mmol, 56 % yield) of the product (R)-4-amino-2[4-(5-bromo-2-chloropyrimidin-4-ylamino)-5-hydroxypentyloxy]-Ndimethylaminomethylenebenzenesulfonamide is obtained. 1H NMR ([D6]DMSO): d = 8.28 (s, 1 H), 8.06 (s, 1 H), 7.39 (m, 1 H), 7.17 (d, 1 H), 6.11 (m, 2 H), 5.79 (s, 2 H), 4.89 (t, 1 H), 4.20 (m, 1 H), 3.88 (m, 2 H), 3.51 (m, 2 H), 3.11 (s, 3 H), 2.85 (s, 3 H), 1.75 ppm (m, 4 H); ESMS (m/z): 535. A solution of the obtained product (90 mg, 0.17 mmol) in acetonitrile/MeOH/water (8:2:1 v/v/v (mL)) is added by syringe pump over 2.5 h to a solution of acetonitrile/water/HCl (4 m in dioxane) (45:5:0.6 v/v/v (mL)) at reflux. After another 16 h at reflux, the organic solvents are removed in vacuo. The reaction mixture is made basic by the addition of NaHCO3 (saturated) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2  ). The combined organic phases are dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The remaining residue is digested with tert-butyl methyl ether. 62 mg (0.14 mmol, 83 % yield) of the product 45 is obtained. 1H NMR ([D6]DMSO): d = 9.79 (s, 1 H), 8.53 (br, 1 H), 8.11 (s, 1 H), 7.52 (m, 1 H), 6.83 (s, 2 H),
