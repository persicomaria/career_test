Abstract Aurora kinases A (also known as Aurora, Aurora-2, AIK, AIR-1, AIRK1, AYK1, BTAK, Eg2, MmIAK1 and STK15), Aurora B (also known as Aurora-1, AIM-1, AIK2, AIR-2, AIRK-2, ARK2, IAL-1 and STK12) and Aurora C (also known as AIK3) participate in several biological processes, including cytokinesis and dysregulated chromosome segregation. These important regulators of mitosis are over-expressed in diverse solid tumors. One member of this family of serine­threonine kinases, human Aurora A, has been proposed as a drugable target in pancreatic cancer. The recent determination of the three-dimensional structure of Aurora A has shown that Aurora kinases exhibit unique conformations around the activation loop region. This property has boosted the search and development of inhibitors of Aurora kinases, which might also function as novel antioncogenic agents. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Being cellular division one of the hallmarks of living organisms, is not surprising that this process is tightly regulated by a vast number of proteins. Among this network of regulatory proteins, Aurora kinases are of particular relevance as they play a crucial role in cellular division by controlling chromatids segregation. Defects in chromatids segregation cause genetic instability, a condition associated with tumorigenesis. Aurora A gene is located within the chromosome locus 20q13, which is a locus frequently detected in human breast tumors (Lengauer, Kinzler, & Vogelstein, 1998).

Aurora B is a chromosome passenger involved in cytokinesis and chromosome architecture (Adams et al., 2000), while Aurora C expression plays a role in spermatogenesis at the time when cells assemble the two meiotic spindles and also cooperates with Aurora B to regulate mitotic chromosome dynamics in mammalian cells (Hu, Chuang, Lee, Tseng, & Tang, 2000; Sasai et al., 2004). More recently, a novel human Aurora C splicing variant (Aurora C-SV) which encodes a 290amino-acid protein, has been cloned and characterized (Yan et al., 2005). As shown in Table 1, Aurora kinases exhibit differential substrate affinity, localization and elicit a different cell response. Mammalian genomes uniquely encode for three Aurora kinases, Aurora A, Aurora B, and Aurora C, while for other metazoans, including the frog, fruitfly and

nematode, only Aurora A and B kinases are known. The yeast genomes S. cerevisiae and S. pombe encode for only one Aurora-like homolog, suggesting that the functions of auroras have diverged throughout evolution. Indeed, phylogenetic trees suggest that all three vertebrate Auroras evolved from a single urochordate ancestor. Aurora A is an orthologous lineage in coldblooded vertebrates and mammals, while structurally similar Auroras B and C evolved more recently in mammals from a duplication of an ancestral Aurora B/C gene found in cold-blooded vertebrates (Brown, Koretke, Birkeland, Sanseau, & Patrick, 2004).

alignment of Auroras A and B allows the identification of one distantly conserved `KEN' motif, spanning 11­18 residues. The `KEN' motif acts as a Cdh1dependant anaphase-promoting complex (APC) recognition signal. The C-terminal domain of human Aurora B shares 53% and 73% sequence similarity to human Auroras A and C, respectively. The comparison of the crystal structure of human Aurora A against that predicted from the amino acid sequences of human Auroras B and C also supports the notion that vertebrate Auroras B and C are closely related paralogs (Brown et al., 2004).

2. Structure Human Auroras A­C are kinases of a size ranging from 309 to 403 amino acid residues that exhibit a relatively high sequence divergence between species. For example, the overall sequence identities between human and rodent proteins are: Aurora A (82%), Aurora B (84%) and Aurora C (78%). As shown in Fig. 1, Aurora kinases A­C present a similar domain organization: a N-terminal domain of 39­129 residues in length, a protein kinase domain and a short C-terminal domain of 15­20 residues. The N-terminal domain of Auroras A­C shares low sequence conservation, which determines selectivity during protein­protein interactions (Carmena & Earnshaw, 2003). As shown in Fig. 2A for the human counterpart, the catalytic domain of Aurora kinases A­C is more conserved. The PEST-like motif has been identified in Aurora C. The mutation of this motif, which is located at the N terminus, significantly abrogates Aurora C kinase activity (Chen & Tang, 2002). It has also been established that the main phosphorylation site of mouse Aurora C is threonine 171, which is phosphorylated by protein kinase A. The

3. Synthesis and degradation Human Aurora A is turned over through the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Walter, Seghezzi, Korver, Sheung, & Lees, 2000). Aurora A degradation is dependent on hCdh1 in vivo, not on hCdc20 (Taguchi et al., 2002) and involves two different degradation motifs. The first corresponds to a N-terminal, D-Box-activating motif (RxLxPS). This motif confers functionality to a second motif, a D-Box, consisting of the sequence RxxLxxG. As shown in Fig. 1, the D-box is located at the C-terminus of the kinase domain and is the target of Fizzy-related proteins (Castro et al., 2002). Aurora A undergoes cell cycle dependent regulation: it is inactivated or degraded when the cell proceeds in G1 phase and its maximal expression occurs in G2/M phases. The cell cannot function with a high level of Aurora kinase activity, as its over-expression in cultured cells produces a transformed phenotype. Although Aurora B possesses the same D-Box as Aurora A, it is not degraded by the same ubiquitin ligase. Instead, Aurora B undergoes degradation by

Fig. 1. Domain organisation of Aurora kinases A­C. As shown here, Aurora kinases present three domains: The N-terminal and the C-terminal domains contain most of the Aurora's regulatory motifs, while the central region contains the catalytic domain. In addition to the kinase activity, this central domain also presents regulatory motifs, as the crystal structure of the Aurora A-TPX2 complex has shown.

binding to the human proteasome -subunit C8 (HC8) in a proteasome-dependent manner (Shu et al., 2003). In contrast with Auroras A and B, the mechanism(s) involved in Aurora C degradation remain obscure. Certainly, the detailed study of Aurora C regulation constitutes an interesting area of research. 4. Biological function 4.1. Aurora A The maintenance of a functional balance between mitotic checkpoint proteins and Aurora A is essential for the proper progression through mitosis. Aurora A overexpression contributes to genetic instability and tumorigenesis by disrupting the proper assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex at the level of the Cdc20­BubR1 interaction (Ke, Dou, Zhang, & Yao, 2003). Its overexpression also causes resistance to apoptosis induced by taxol in human cancer cell lines (Anand, Penrhyn-Lowe, & Venkitaraman, 2003).

Moreover, this kinase is a key regulatory component of the p53 pathway as its overexpression leads to increased p53 degradation, which facilitates oncogenic transformation (Katayama et al., 2004). Although Aurora A activation seems to depend on cdc2/cyclinB activity, the kinase that phosphorylates Aurora A has not yet been identified. The crystal structure of Aurora A complexed with the microtubule associated protein TPX2 (Fig. 2B) has revealed how TPX2 binding induces a conformational change in Aurora A in such a way that the phosphorylated activation domain of this kinase adopts a more compact position, providing a better substrate binding platform and hiding the activating phosphoryl group from attack by PP1 (Bayliss, Sardon, Vernos, & Conti, 2003). 4.2. Aurora B Aurora B also plays an essential role in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis and its kinase activity is required for bipolar chromosome orientation and

condensation (Dewar, Tanaka, Nasmythm, & Tanaka, 2004). Aurora B kinases are `chromosomal passenger' proteins, which are found in cells in a complex with inner centromere protein (INCENP) and survivin. This complex first localizes along the chromosome during prophase, become concentrated at the inner centromere region during prometaphase and leave the chromosome and localize to the central spindle in anaphase. The over-expression of an Aurora B kinase-dead mutant (K-R) causes multiple defects in the mitotic machinery, including the loss of kinetochore attachment to microtubules and the exit from mitosis without anaphase or cytokinesis (Murata-Hori & Wang, 2002). Although Aurora B plays a major role in the kinetochore assembly pathway in mammalian cells, only one Aurora B target, centromere protein-A, has been identified to date. 4.3. Aurora C Very little is known on the function and regulation of this kinase. Aurora C is expressed at a moderate level albeit about an order of magnitude lower than Aurora B in diploid human fibroblasts. In contrast, the level of Aurora C is elevated in several human cancer cell types. Auroras C and B protein expression is maximally elevated during the G2/M phase but their expression profiles in synchronized cells reveal differential temporal regulation through the cell cycle. Aurora C, like Aurora B, interacts with the inner centromere protein (INCENP) at the carboxyl terminal end spanning the conserved IN box domain (Li et al., 2004). Competition binding assays and transfection experiments revealed that, compared with Auroras B, Auroras C has a lower binding affinity to INCENP. It has also been shown that an Aurora C kinase-dead mutant induces multinucleation in a dose-dependent manner and that siRNA mediated silencing of both Auroras B and C give rise to multinucleated cells. Interestingly, Aurora C is able to rescue the Aurora B silenced multinucleation phenotype, demonstrating that Aurora C kinase function overlaps with and complements Aurora B kinase function in mitosis (Sasai et al., 2004). Thus, Aurora C is a chromosomal passenger protein localizing first to centromeres and then to the midzone of mitotic cells that cooperates with Aurora B to regulate mitotic chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in mammalian cells.

5. Possible medical applications Aurora A has been recognized as a good marker of tumor progression and prognosis. Therefore, the inhibition of its kinase activity could help to reduce tumor aggressiveness. Although the crystal structure of human Aurora A revealed that its catalytic domain exhibits a similar topology as that observed in many kinases, 3 out of 26 residues lining its ATP-binding active site are variant (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the activation loop region and a fluoro-phenyl pocket of Aurora A exhibit unique conformations, features that can be exploited for drug design. Certainly, the analysis of ATP-binding domains (Fig. 2C) has opened a promising new front in the search of novel anti-oncogenic drugs that target Aurora kinases. Several Aurora inhibitors have been synthesized to date: hesperadin, an inhibitor of Aurora B; the quinazoline ZM447439, an inhibitor of Auroras A and B and more recently, the phenylamide VX-680, a selective inhibitor of the three Auroras. Based on this rationale framework for designing anti-tumor drugs, it is not exaggerated to affirm that the future looks bright for Aurora kinases. Acknowledgement V.
