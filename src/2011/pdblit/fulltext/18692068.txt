The compound UIC-94017 (TMC-114) is a second-generation HIV protease inhibitor with improved pharmacokinetics that is chemically related to the clinical inhibitor amprenavir. UIC-94017 is a broad-spectrum potent inhibitor active against HIV-1 clinical isolates with minimal cytotoxicity. We have determined the high-resolution crystal structures of UIC-94017 in complexes with wild-type HIV-1 protease (PR) and mutant proteases PRV82A and PRI84V that are common in drug-resistant HIV. The structures ° were refined at resolutions of 1.10­ 1.53 A. The crystal structures of PR and PRI84V with UIC-94017 ternary complexes show that the inhibitor binds to the protease in two overlapping positions, while the PRV82A complex had one ordered inhibitor. In all three structures, UIC-94017 forms hydrogen bonds with the conserved main-chain atoms of Asp29 and Asp30 of the protease. These interactions are proposed to be critical for the potency of this compound against HIV isolates that are resistant to multiple protease inhibitors. Other small differences were observed in the interactions of the mutants with UIC-94017 as compared to PR. PRV82A showed differences in the position of the main-chain atoms of residue 82 compared to PR structure that better accommodated the ° inhibitor. Finally, the 1.10 A resolution structure of PRV82A with UIC-94017 showed an unusual distribution of electron density for the catalytic aspartate residues, which is discussed in relation to the reaction mechanism.

Introduction
Inhibitors of the HIV-1 protease (PR) are effective antiviral drugs and have dramatically improved the survival of patients infected with HIV-1. How Y.T. and P.I.B. contributed equally to this work. Abbreviations used: PR, wild-type HIV-1 protease; PRV82A, PR with V82A mutation; PRI84V, PR with I84V mutation; DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide. E-mail address of the corresponding author: iweber@gsu.edu

ever, the long-term therapeutic efficacy is compromised by the rapid selection of drug-resistant variants of the PR.1 Cross-resistance and multidrug resistance have been reported in AIDS patients on combination therapy.2,3 The clinical inhibitors select for different mutations, and complex patterns of mutations have been observed.4 HIV PR is catalytically active as a dimer, and the catalytic Asp25 residues from both subunits interact closely at the subunit interface. The substratebinding site consists of subsites S3 to S40 for peptide substrates extending from residues P3 to

342 P40 . The clinical inhibitors are observed to bind in PR subsites S2 ­S20 . Mutations that alter the inhibitor-binding site are common, including mutations of residues D30, M46, I50, V82 and I84. Other mutations alter residues located far from the inhibitor-binding site, such as L90M. Mutants with either increased or decreased catalytic activity, inhibition or stability relative to the wildtype enzyme have been observed.5 ­ 9 Crystal structures of resistant mutants have provided the molecular basis for the altered enzymatic properties and the resistant phenotype.7,10 ­ 12 The result of detailed structural and kinetic studies is that individual mutations, and the tested pairs of mutations, show a range of effects that depend on the specific combination of mutant with substrate or inhibitor. Therefore, it is important to obtain high-resolution crystal structures in order to observe the small structural changes associated with the mutations. Novel inhibitors that target critical conserved regions of the PR different from those of the current drugs are expected to be more active against resistant variants of HIV-1. A novel non-peptide inhibitor UIC-94017 (TMC114) has been developed that is extremely potent in vivo against a wide spectrum of HIV strains including multi-drugresistant clinical strains.13 This promising nonpeptidic inhibitor is in Phase IIB clinical trials. This compound is chemically related to the clinical inhibitor amprenavir, and was designed with a novel bis-tetrahydrofuranylurethane (bis-THF) group to incorporate additional polar interactions with main-chain atoms of the PR dimer. Crystal structures of complexes of the UIC-94017 with PR and two of the most common drug-resistant mutants, PRV82A and PRI84V, have been determined at high resolution to understand the molecular basis for the potency of this compound.

Results
Chemical synthesis of UIC-94017 The synthesis of UIC-94017 (1) is outlined in Figure 1. Commercially available optically active epoxide 314 was reacted with isobutylamine in 2-propanol at 84 8C for six hours. The resulting amino alcohol was reacted with 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride to provide the sulfonamide derivative 3.15 Reduction of nitro group of 4 by catalytic hydrogenation over 10% Pd ­ C in ethyl acetate provided the corresponding aromatic amine. Trifluoroacetic acid promoted removal of BOC-group followed by reaction of the resulting diamine with mixed carbonate 516 furnished inhibitor 117 selectively. Synthesis of UIC-94017 was confirmed by 1H-NMR. Enzyme kinetics and relative inhibition of PRV82A and PRI84V PR and the drug-resistant mutant proteases, PRV82A and PRI84V, catalyze the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate, an analog of the CA-p2 cleavage site in the Gag-Pol polyprotein, between Nle and (NO2)Phe, and their catalytic activities are competitively inhibited by UIC-94017. Saturation kinetics were observed for PR, PRV82A and PRI84V-catalyzed hydrolysis of substrate. The kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Overall, similar kcat =Km values were observed: PRV82A and PRI84V showed 85% and 71% of the PR value, respectively. PRI84V showed a fourfold increase in Km , and a threefold increase in Ki for UIC-94017 as compared to PR and PRV82A. Most of the other clinical inhibitors showed significantly poorer relative inhibition of the protease with V82A or I84V mutations.18 Amprenavir was an

Description of the high-resolution crystal structures The crystal structures of PR and drug-resistant mutants PRV82A and PRI84V have been determined in complex with UIC-94017. Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 2. The crystallographic asymmetric units contain a PR dimer with the residues in the two subunits numbered 1 ­99 and 10 ­ 990 . The three structures were determined in two different space groups and were refined ° to resolutions of 1.10 ­1.53 A and R-factors of 0.117­ 0.134 including solvent molecules, anisotropic B-factors and hydrogen atoms. These highresolution crystal structures showed excellent electron density for all the protease atoms, the inhibitor, and solvent molecules. The electron density map for Tyr590 and interacting atoms in the PR structure is shown in Figure 2. The average B-factors were low for protein and inhibitor atoms. The highest resolution structure of PRV82A had the lowest R-factor. PRV82A showed the lowest

The inhibitor atoms also had the lowest average B-factors for the complex with ° ° ° PRV82A: 7.4 A2 compared to 10.8 A2 and 14.1 A2 for PR and PRI84V, respectively. Alternate conformations were modeled for residues in all the crystal structures. There were 36 residues with two alternate conformations modeled for PR, 37 for PRV82A and 41 for PRI84V mutant (Table 3). There was clear electron density for the alternate positions of these side-chains, as shown by the examples in Figure 3. The residues with alternate conformations were not the same in both subunits, or in all three structures. However, PR and PRI84V showed a similar pattern, probably because they are in the same space group, and both showed two conformations of the inhibitor. Most alternate conformations were observed for the side-chains of surface residues, especially residues with longer side-chains, such as arginine, lysine, glutamine and glutamic acid. The sidechains of Ile330 , Ile64, Leu89, and Leu97 are in internal hydrophobic regions. The side-chains of seven amino acid residues close to the inhibitor, Arg8, Asp30, Val32, Ile47, Ile50, Pro81, Val82, and Ile84, showed alternate conformations in at least one subunit. Disorder was previously reported for Val32, Val82 and Ile84 in ternary complexes of protease bound to substrate analogs.11 The main-chain atoms of Ile50 and 500 in the two subunits had two alternative conformations, with relative occupancies of 0.6 to 0.4, in the two space group P21212 structures. The carbonyl groups in these two residues can flip about 1808 and still form the hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl

The structure of PRV82A in space group P212121 showed two alternative conformations of the main-chain atoms between residues 4 and 5, which are located at the dimer surface. Ile64 in PRV82A had alternate mainchain and side-chain conformations in an internal hydrophobic region. The occupancy distribution is 0.7 to 0.3 and there was no change in the interactions with surrounding residues. Solvent structure in the crystals Previous crystal structures of HIV protease­ inhibitor complexes were modeled with a single shell of solvent molecules.11 The high quality of diffraction data for the structures described here permitted the modeling of a second shell of solvent. The solvent was modeled with more than

200 water molecules, ions and other small molecules from the crystallization solutions, including many with partial occupancy, depending on the shape of the electron density and the interactions with other molecules. The ions modeled were sodium, chloride, acetate and phosphate. Glycerol and DMSO were fitted to density in the PR and PRV82A. Examples of the electron density maps for solvent regions are shown in Figure 4. The average B-factors for the solvent atoms were ° ° 24.1 A2 for PRV82A and 31 ­32 A2 for PR and PRI84V complexes. Protease ­inhibitor interactions The crystal structure of HIV-1 PR showed two pseudosymmetric positions of UIC-94017 with

relative occupancy of 0.55/0.45 (Figure 5(a)). The side-chains of several amino acids in the binding site showed two conformations, as observed previously for hydrophobic side-chains near the peptide analogs.11 The inhibitor P1 and P10 groups form van der Waals interactions with protease residues Leu23, Gly49, Ile50, Pro81, Val82, and Ile84 from both subunits. The end groups interact with residues Ala28, Asp29, Asp30, Val32, Ile47 and Ile50. The CG atom of Pro810 in the PR structure interacts closely with the inhibitor and shows alternate positions with the occupancy distribution of 0.55 to 0.45, which is the same as that of the inhibitor. This suggests that the orientation of the amino acid side-chains correlates with that of the inhibitor. Theoretically, the greater flexibility of the structure will increase the entropy and in turn

reduce the interaction energy between protein and inhibitor. The PR ­inhibitor hydrogen bond interactions are shown in Figure 6(a). Equivalent interactions exist for both positions of the inhibitor (Table 4). The inhibitor hydroxyl group interacted with all four carboxylate oxygen atoms of the catalytic Asp25 and 250 . The carbonyl oxygen and one of the sulfonamide oxygen atoms forms hydrogen bonds with the water that interacts with the amides of Ile50 and 500 on the flaps, as observed in most HIV protease­ inhibitor complexes.19 No other water-mediated interactions were observed between PR and UIC-94017. The two oxygen atoms of the bis-THF group of the inhibitor are positioned to form hydrogen bond interactions with the main-chain amides of Asp29 and Asp30. The bis-THF O28 also formed a close interaction with the OD2 of Asp29, similar to the protonmediated interaction observed between Asp29 and peptide analogs with P20 Glu.11 The amino group at the other end of the inhibitor interacts with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen and the side-chain carboxylate oxygen of Asp300 . It is instructive to compare the protease interactions of UIC-94017 with those of the structurally related inhibitor, amprenavir. The crystal structure of wild-type protease with amprenavir was ° determined at 1.9 A resolution20 (PDB: 1HPV). Amprenavir had fewer hydrogen bond interactions with the protease residues Asp29 and Asp30

(Table 4; Figure 6(b)). Only the amino group of amprenavir formed a hydrogen bond interaction with the carboxylate oxygen of Asp30, while the interactions with the amides of Asp29 and 30 ° were 3.5 A long. Amprenavir and UIC-94017 have

similar hydrophobic groups with the exception of the bis-THF at one end of UIC-94017. Therefore, many of the hydrophobic interactions with PR are similar for both inhibitors. The bis-THF group of UIC-94017 introduced one very short van der

The protease­UIC-94017 interatomic distances are shown for the crystal structures of PR, PRV82A and PRI84V complexes. The PR and PRI84V complexes have two positions of UIC-94017. The atoms of the major UIC-94017 conformation and interacting PR atoms are indicated in bold. The Asp25 and 250 carboxylate oxygen atoms interacted with OH in both positions of UIC-94017. PRV82A had one UIC-94017 with two conformations for the anilino group that had different interactions. The interatomic distances are shown for equivalent atoms of amprenavir from 1HPV crystal structure. a The minor conformation of the anilino NH2 interacted with Asp30 OD2.

° Waals contact of 2.9 ­3.0 A with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly48, which cannot occur in amprenavir. However, both UIC-94017 and amprenavir showed little change in Ki values for PR and mutants V82A and I84V (Table 1).18 Comparison of inhibitor interactions in PR and mutants UIC-94017 has very similar conformation and interactions in all three structures, with the exception of the anilino group, which has two conformations in the PRV82A structure. The crystal structure of PRI84V showed inhibitor bound in two orientations with relative occupancy of 0.69/0.31. The protease­ inhibitor interactions are essentially identical with those of PR, except that the lower ° occupancy inhibitor showed a weak (3.5 A) interaction with the amide of Asp30 (Table 4). PRV82A showed ordered density for the inhibitor and two conformations for the anilino group as shown in Figure 5(b). The hydrogen bond interactions with UIC-94017 were very similar to those of wild-type enzyme except for those of the amino group (Table 4). The two conformations of the anilino group had relative occupancy of 0.56/0.44. Both conformations of the NH2 group formed hydrogen bond interactions with the carboxyl oxygen of Asp30, as observed for PR. One conformation also ° had a weak (3.5 A) hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Asp30, similar to that observed for wild-type enzyme. However, the NH2 group in the other conformation interacted with a water molecule instead. These small dif-

ferences suggested that PRV82A had weaker polar interactions with UIC-94017 compared to those of PR. The PR and mutants had almost identical numbers of van der Waals contacts with inhibitor. The major inhibitor and PR conformations showed ° 93 van der Waals contacts of less than 4.0 A, while both the mutants showed 91 contacts. PRI84V mutant showed very similar main-chain structure around the mutated residue compared to the wild-type structure, as shown in Figure 7. Residue I84 in PR shows van der Waals interactions with ° the inhibitor with interatomic distances of 3.96 A ° and 4.38 A for the two Ile84 side-chain confor° mations in one subunit, and 5.00 A in the other subunit. These close van der Waals interactions with inhibitor are lost in PRI84V, consistent with the observed twofold lower inhibition of PRI84V compared to PR. In contrast, PRV82A showed a shift in the position of the main-chain atoms compared to those observed for PR (Figure 7). The shift of ° 0.50 A in the 82 a-carbon atom placed the b-carbon ° atom of Ala82 at 3.76 A from the closest inhibitor ° atom, compared to 4.12 A for the b-carbon of Val82. The other subunit showed a larger shift that ° positioned the b-carbon atom of Ala820 at 4.09 A ° from inhibitor, compared to 5.18 A for Val820 . These small shifts result in good van der Waals interactions of Ala82 with inhibitor and offset the loss of the methyl groups of Val82. The structural adaptation of the V82A mutant to accommodate UIC-94017 inhibitor is consistent with the very similar inhibition ðKi Þ values observed for PRV82A and PR.

Geometry of catalytic aspartate residues and implications for reaction mechanism The four carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp25 and 250 were arranged in almost the same plane and ° were at distances of 2.52­ 3.17 A from the hydroxyl oxygen of UIC-94017 in all the structures (Table 4). Two inner carboxylate oxygen atoms of the two catalytic aspartate residues lie within hydrogen bonding distance of each other in the HIV-1 pro° tease structures (2.59 ­ 2.86 A). Consequently, it has been assumed that one aspartate is protonated and the other has a negative charge. The catalytic aspartate residues have been shown to have different pKa values of 3.1 and 5.2, consistent with protonation of one catalytic residue.21 NMR measurements have also indicated that one of the two catalytic aspartate residues was protonated in an HIV-1 protease­inhibitor complex.22 However, due to the symmetrical arrangement of the catalytic aspartate residues 25 and 250 in the dimer of HIV protease it has been difficult to determine the location of the expected proton. The existence and location of the proton has implications for the reaction mechanism. Solvent isotope effects were consistent with the reaction proceeding by the rate-limiting step of dissociation of the enzymebound amide-hydrate intermediate.21 Recent kinetic studies using a fluorogenic substrate at pH 6.0 and 1.25 M salt to obtain the solvent isotope effects have also suggested that cleavage of the carbon ­nitrogen bond was the major contributor to kcat :23 The proposed mechanism involves the

catalytic aspartate residues together with a water molecule that acts as a nucleophile in attacking the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond. This mechanism is difficult to support from the crystal structures of HIV protease with transition state analogs, since there is little space for a water molecule next to the catalytic aspartate residues. The closest water molecule cannot interact directly with the catalytic aspartate residues since it lies at the opposite side of the scissile peptide bond next to Ile50 and 500 of the flaps.

The electron density for the catalytic aspartate residues can be examined for details relevant to the reaction mechanism. The crystal structures of PR and PRI84V showed little or no Fo 2 Fc difference density around the Asp25 and 250 side-chains, in particular, there is no positive difference density suggesting a proton. These structures were refined ° ° at 1.3 A and 1.5 A resolution, respectively, and the lower resolution and disordered inhibitor may mask any density for a proton. However, the ° atomic 1.10 A resolution of the PRV82A structure and the presence of ordered density for inhibitor revealed differences in the electron density around the catalytic aspartate residues. In fact, significant Fo 2 Fc difference density was observed for the carboxylate oxygen atoms, in contrast to the other Asp side-chains in the structure (Figure 8). The two outer carboxylate oxygen atoms (OD2) showed negative difference density. A streak of positive density was observed between the hydroxyl group of the inhibitor and the inner and closest OD1 of ° Asp250 (2.53 A separation of OH and OD1), which may indicate a hydrogen atom. This positive density is reduced, but not eliminated, when hydrogen is added to the Asp250 OD1. The unusual negative difference density can be interpreted as a redistribution of the electrons in the two C ­O bonds in the Asp side-chain to a less symmetric arrangement in which the C ­O bond furthest from the center has more double bond character, and the other has less. Free atom refinement of the car° boxylate groups gave distances of 1.27 A for both C ­ O bonds in Asp25, while Asp250 showed asym° ° metry with 1.23 A for C ­OD1 and 1.29 A for C ­ OD2, consistent with protonation of OD1 (Figure 8). However, the free atom refinement did not significantly change the negative density. Further analysis of the data by charge density analysis or quantum calculations will be necessary to understand the distribution of electrons at the active site. However, the difference densities suggest a more complex mechanism than protonation of a carboxylate oxygen.

Discussion
The UIC-94017 inhibitor is in clinical trials for further development as a new antiviral agent for treatment of primary and multi-PR inhibitorresistant HIV infections due to its favorable pharmacokinetics.13 The hydrogen bond interactions of UIC-94017 with HIV PR can be compared to those of substrate analogs. PR recognizes peptide substrates and peptidic inhibitors by means of a series of hydrogen bond interactions with the main-chain atoms of the substrate, as observed for crystal structures of PR in complex with substrate analogs.19 These interactions span about seven peptide residues lying in PR subsites S3 ­ S40 .24 The clinical inhibitors lie primarily in subsites S2 ­ S20 and generally show fewer hydrogen bond interactions. The UIC-94017 inhibitor is

shorter than the substrate analogs and forms similar hydrogen bonds to PR main-chain groups, including the conserved Asp29.25 In addition, new polar interactions are formed with the main-chain amide, carbonyl oxygen and the carboxylate oxygen of Asp29. These interactions resemble those of the P20 Gln or Glu side-chain of peptide analogs.11,25 These polar interactions of the bis-THF of UIC-94017 were not observed for the most closely related clinical inhibitor, amprenavir. Hence, the UIC-94017 inhibitor more closely mimics many of the natural substrates in the interactions with the PR main-chain atoms than observed for the other clinical inhibitors. The tight binding of the bis-THF group to the main-chain atoms of Asp29 and 30 are expected to be important for the potency of UIC-94017 against multi-drug-resistant HIV.13 These interactions are maintained in the complexes with PRV82A and PRI84V, although PRV82A had a weaker interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of Asp30. PRI84V showed fewer van der Waals interactions of residue 84 with UIC-94017, consistent with a twofold reduction in inhibition as compared to PR. In contrast, PRV82A showed rearrangements of the main-chain atoms around residues 82 and 820 , which permitted closer interaction of Ala82 and 820 with UIC-94017, and partly compensated for the fewer side-chain atoms in Ala compared to Val. The structural rearrangements are consistent with similar inhibition observed for both PRV82A and PR. The crystal structure reported for PRV82A with the inhibitor A-77003, also showed rearrangements of the backbone atoms in one subunit,26 while a recent study described fewer interactions of Ala82 with inhibitors saquinavir and ritonavir compared to those of Val82.12 UIC-94017 is an effective inhibitor of both the V82A and I84V mutants, which are common in drug-resistant clinical isolates. These new crystal structures of HIV PR mutants with UIC-94017 will provide the framework for the design of new inhibitors that are more effective against resistant HIV. The highest resolution structure of PRV82A mutant provides an intriguing view of the catalytic residues and further analysis will help understand the protonation states of the catalytic aspartate residues and the reaction mechanism.

Materials and Methods
Chemical synthesis of UIC-94017 The synthesis is shown in Figure 1. UIC-94017 (compound 1) was formed by the reaction of the intermediate compounds (1S)-benzyl-3-[isobutyl-(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)amino]-(2R)-hydroxy-propyl]-carbamic acid tertbutylester (compound 4) and bis-tetrahydrofuranylsuccinimidyl carbonate (compound 5). Synthesis of the intermediate compounds is described. Compound 4 was prepared by heating a stirred solution of tert-butyl[S-(R,R)]-(2)-(1-oxiranyl-2-phenylethyl)carbamate 3 (100 mg, 0.38 mmol) and isobutylamine (0.23 ml, 2.28 mmol) in isopropanol (3 ml) under reflux

for six hours. Evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue, which was chromatographed over silica gel (7% MeOH in CHCl3 as the eluent; Rf ¼ 0:35, 10% MeOH in CHCl3) to yield the corresponding amine (126 mg, 99%). 4-Nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (90 mg, 0.41 mmol) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (5 ml) were added to a stirred solution of the above amino alcohol (92 mg, 0.27 mmol) in dichloromethane (5 ml). The resulting mixture was stirred at 23 8C for 12 hours, extracted with CH2Cl2 and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Removal of solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue, which was chromatographed over silica gel (3% EtOAc in CHCl3 as the eluent; Rf ¼ 0:49, 10% EtOAc in CHCl3) to afford the compound 4 (140 mg, 96%) as a white solid (m.p. 167­169 8C). Compound 5 was prepared by stirring a solution of (3R,3aS,6aR)-3-hydroxyhexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan (100 mg, 0.77 mmol), N,N0 -disuccinimidyl carbonate (295 mg, 1.15 mmol), and triethylamine (0.2 ml, 1.54 mmol), in distilled acetonitrile (3 ml) at 23 8C for seven hours. Then, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was diluted with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (4 ml) and extracted with EtOAc (3 £ 5 ml). The combined organic extract was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue, which was chromatographed over silica gel (1% MeOH in CHCl3 as the eluent; Rf ¼ 0:62, 10% MeOH in CHCl3) to yield the title compound 5 (135 mg, 66%) as a white solid (m.p. 122­ 125 8C). Finally, UIC-94017 (1) was prepared by adding Pd/C (7 mg) to a solution of compound 4 (64 mg, 0.123 mmol) in EtOAc (10 ml) and stirring the mixture at 23 8C under a hydrogen-filled balloon for 11 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered over Celite and the filter cake was washed with EtOAc. Removal of solvent under reduced pressure, followed by column chromatography over silica gel (7% EtOAc in CHCl3 as the eluent; Rf ¼ 0:16, 10% EtOAc in CHCl3) afforded the corresponding aromatic amine (61 mg, 95%). A solution of the above amine (33 mg, 0.07 mmol) in a mixture of 30% trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2 (6 ml) was stirred at 23 8C for 40 minutes. After this period, solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (6 ml). Succinimidyl carbonate 5 (20 mg, 0.07 mmol) and triethylamine (0.1 ml, 0.67 mmol) were added to this solution, and the resulting mixture was stirred for three hours. Removal of solvent under reduced pressure gave a residue, which was chromatographed over silica gel (2% MeOH in CHCl3 as the eluent, Rf ¼ 0:63, 10% MeOH in CHCl3) to furnish inhibitor 1 (36 mg, 96%) as a white amorphous solid. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) d 0.81 (d, 3H, J ¼ 6.6 Hz), 0.90 (d, 3H, J ¼ 6.6 Hz), 1.42 ­ 1.46 (M, 1H), 1.57­ 1.65 (m, 1H), 1.79 ­ 1.85 (m, 1H), 2.75 ­ 2.81 (m, 2H), 2.87 ­ 2.98 (m, 3H), 3.05 ­3.16 (m, 2H), 3.64­ 3.71 (m, 2H), 3.82 ­ 3.88 (m, 3H), 3.92 ­3.96 (m, 1H), 4.97­ 5.01 (m, 2H), 5.63 (d, 1H, J ¼ 5.14 Hz), 6.67 (d, 2H, J ¼ 8.6 Hz), 7.18­ 7.28 (m, 5H), 7.53 (d, 2H, J ¼ 8.6 Hz); 13C-NMR (125.7 MHz, CDCl3) d 19.92, 20.18, 25.81, 27.29, 29.68, 35.68, 45.35, 53.77, 55.11, 58.90, 69.61, 70.81, 72.84, 73.36, 109.29, 114.12, 125.99, 126.52, 128.50, 129.41, 137.69, 150.75, 155.43. Protein preparation and determination of the inhibition constants and kinetic parameters The stabilized HIV-1 protease (PR), which has been

optimized for structural and kinetic studies, bears five mutations, Q7K, L33I and L63I to minimize the autoproteolysis of the protease and C67A and C95 to prevent cysteine-thiol oxidation.11 PR templates with the appropriate oligonucleotide primers were used to introduce the V82A and I84V mutations. All constructs were generated using the Quick-Change Mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified by DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. Proteins were prepared using the protocol described.11 The chromogenic substrate Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-p-nitroPhe-Glu-Ala-Nleamide (Sigma) was used in a spectroscopic assay. Protease (final concentration of 70 ­ 120 nM) was added to 300 mM substrate in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol and assayed over ten minutes for the decrease in absorbance at 310 nm on a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. The absorbances were converted to substrate concentration via a calibration curve. Michealis ­ Menten analysis used 25 ­ 400 mM substrate. The Michaelis ­ Menten curves were fit using SigmaPlot 8.0.2 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The Ki values were obtained from the IC50 values estimated from a dose ­ response curve with the spectroscopic assay using the equation Ki ¼ ðIC50 2 ½E=2Þ=ð1þ ½S=Km Þ, where [E] and [S] are the protease and substrate concentrations, respectively.27 Crystallographic analysis UIC-94017 was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method using 2:1 to 5:1 ratios of inhibitor to protein. Crystals of PR complex grew with a well solution of 30 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.8), 10% (w/v) NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) DMSO and 10% dioxane at room temperature. PRV82A crystals grew using a well solution of 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer (pH 5.0), 40% saturated ammonium sulfate, and 7% DMSO. PRI84V crystals were obtained from 30 mM citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0), 8 ­ 9% NaCl, and 10% DMSO. The crystals were frozen with a cryoprotectant of 20 ­30% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected on the SER-CAT beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data were processed using the HKL 2000.28 The structures were solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe.29 The starting models for molecular replacement were chosen as the highest resolution structures in the same space group as the new crystal structure. The starting models were 1FG6 for the PR complex, 1DAZ for PRV82A, and the new PR-UIC-94017 structure was used to solve the PRI84V mutant. The inhibitor structure was generated using AMMP30 and fitted manually to the electron density map. The structures were refined including anisotropic B-factors using SHELX97,31 and refitted using O 8.0.32 Structure solution in the P21 space group was tested for the PR complex, but the two conformations of inhibitor were not resolved, unlike a previous study.25 Alternate conformations for residues were modeled where observed. The solvent was modeled with more than 200 water molecules and ions or other solvent molecules from crystallization conditions, including many with partial occupancy. The identity of ions and other solvent molecules from the crystallization conditions were deduced from the shape and peak height of the 2Fo 2 Fc electron density, the potential for hydrogen bond interactions, coordination state and interatomic distances. The PR crystal structure was refined with one sodium ion, two chloride ions, two acetate ions, two glycerol

molecules, and 246 water molecules including partial occupancy sites. The PRV82A structure included chloride, six acetate ions, four phosphate groups, one glycerol, one DMSO, and 275 water molecules including partial occupancy sites. The lowest resolution structure of PRI84V was refined with sodium, three chloride molecules, and 355 water molecules including partial occupancy sites. Hydrogen atom positions were included in the last round of refinement using all data. Figures were made using O32 and MolScript.33 Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank as 1S6G (PR), 1S65 (PRV82A), and 1S6S (PRI84V).
