ABSTRACT Neuroglobin, a recently discovered globin predominantly expressed in neuronal tissue of vertebrates, binds small, gaseous ligands at the sixth coordination position of the heme iron. In the absence of an exogenous ligand, the distal histidine (His64) binds to the heme iron in the ferrous and ferric states. The crystal structure of murine ferric (met) neuroglobin at 1.5 Å reveals interesting features relevant to the ligand binding mechanism. Only weak selectivity is observed for the two possible heme orientations, the occupancy ratio being 70:30. Two small internal cavities are present on the heme distal side, which enable the His64(E7) side chain to move out of the way upon exogenous ligand binding. Moreover, a third, huge cavity (volume approximately 290 Å3) connecting both sides of the heme, is open towards the exterior and provides a potential passageway for ligands. The CD and EF corners exhibit substantial flexibility, which may assist ligands in entering the protein and accessing the active site. Based on this high-resolution structure, further structure-function studies can be planned to elucidate the role of neuroglobin in physiological responses to hypoxia.

INTRODUCTION Hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) are classical representatives of the globins, an extended family of heme proteins that bind, transport, scavenge, detoxify, and sense small gaseous molecules such as O2, NO, and CO.1­7 The last years have witnessed the discovery of new globins in all kingdoms of life.8 ­11 Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered globin that is predominantly expressed in the brain and other nerve tissue of vertebrates.12 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ngb forms a class distinct from the Mbs and Hbs, suggesting that this ancient protein existed long before the genes encoding Mb and Hb diverged.12 The closest relatives of Ngb are the globins of the polychaete annelid worm Aphrodite aculeata (30% amino acid identity),13 which are also expressed in nerve cells of this animal. The physiological function of Ngb is still a mystery. Its moderate affinity for O2 (1­2 torr) and its expression in cerebral neurons suggest a role in neuronal responses to hypoxia or ischemia, as supported by several pieces of evidence, including recent experiments carried out in vivo.14

Ngb, a single polypeptide of 151 amino acids, bears only small sequence similarity to the vertebrate globins Mb ( 21%) and Hb ( 25%). Nevertheless, all key determinants of genuine globins15 are conserved: a proximal histidine residue His96(F8) links the polypeptide chain to the heme iron, a distal histidine residue His64(E7) resides close to the binding site of the diatomic ligand, and a phenylalanine residue Phe42(CD1) is involved in ­ stacking interactions with the heme.16 [In this paper, we quote the topological positions in parenthesis, according to the alignment with sperm whale (sw) Mb.] Ngb is the first example of a vertebrate globin that is hexacoordinate in the "deoxy" ferrous form, in the absence of a bound exogenous ligand.17­19 This feature was previously reported only for invertebrate11,20 and plant globins.21 Indeed, Ngb resembles nonsymbiotic plant hemoglobins5,22,23: (i) Key residues known to control the affinity for exogenous ligands (at positions B10, E7, and E11) are identical in both groups, being Phe, His, and Val, respectively; (ii) Ngbs and nonsymbiotic plant Hbs show "usual" association and dissociation rate coefficients in spite of unusual heme coordination24 and (iii) Ngbs and nonsymbiotic plant Hbs are both expressed at low (micromolar) concentrations. In the vast majority of globins, the met (Fe3 ) state is hexacoordinate, with an exogenous ligand, for example H2O or OH , at the sixth coordination, whereas the ferrous deoxy (Fe2 ) form is generally pentacoordinate. In Ngb, the distal His64(E7) is coordinated to the heme iron in both the ferrous and ferric forms; because of the absence of an exogenous ligand, they are conventionally referred to as "unliganded."

The structure of Ngb must be predisposed to accommodate the exchange of the endogenous imidazole side chain of His64(E7) for the exogenous, gaseous ligand, which is considered a novel mechanism for regulating ligand binding affinity. This interesting dynamic process was studied spectroscopically in great detail,18 and fluctuations between different conformations were observed on surprisingly long time scales. To elucidate the function and dynamics of Ngb, detailed knowledge of the high resolution three-dimensional structure of both oxidation states with and without bound exogenous ligands is a prerequisite. In this work, we present a high-resolution structure (1.50 Å) of ferric murine Ngb. Recently, Pesce et al.16 have reported the structure of ferric human Ngb (hNgb) at 1.95 Å resolution. As expected from the high sequence identity (94%), the overall structures of the two proteins are very similar, with the same hexacoordinate heme iron geometry and a large internal cavity. However, the significantly higher resolution of the murine Ngb structure allows us to clearly pinpoint and quantify the unique heterogeneity of heme insertion. Moreover, our structure reveals a connection of the large internal cavity with the bulk. Other features, evident at quasi-atomic resolution, such as a water molecule docked close to the distal His(E7), allow us to discuss in detail the structural rearrangements necessary to accommodate exogenous heme ligands. These X-ray structures will help to clarify the physiological role of Ngb at the molecular level, which may offer new avenues to the therapy of stroke, since the expression level of Ngb correlates with the extent of ischemic brain damage.14,25 MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization Murine Ngb (mutant C55S/C120S) was produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys as described.18 This particular mutant was used since the presence of oxidizable cysteines in the wild type protein hindered crystallization. Crystals of murine neuroglobin mutant C55S/C120S were grown using the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method. The Hampton research Crystal Screen I kit was used to screen for a large number of crystallization conditions. Each well contained 1 ml of buffer solution. Drops were prepared by mixing 5 l of protein solution (10 mg protein dissolved in 1 ml of H2O) and 5 l of buffer solution. Plates were stored at 293°C. Crystallization occurred under two conditions: (i) 0.1 M HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, 1.5 M Li2SO4 and (ii) 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 2 M sodium formate. Structure Determination Crystals under condition (ii) reached a typical size of 0.15 0.15 0.15 mm3. They were subjected to X-ray data collection at the Elettra synchrotron source (Trieste, Italy), where they diffracted up to 1.5 Å resolution on a MAR CCD detector. The crystals belonged to space group R32, with cell parameters a b 86.97 Å, c 110.82 Å, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of

38.98%. Data were indexed and scaled using the programs Denzo and Scalepack.26 Phasing was carried out by taking advantage of the presence of the iron atom in the heme prosthetic group.27 A high redundancy data set was collected at a wavelength of 1.7 Å to maximize the Fe anomalous signal up to a resolution of 1.9 Å. A second data set was collected on the same crystal at 1.2 Å at a resolution of 1.5 Å (see Table I). The anomalous data set was used for phase determination using the program Solve,28 and the position of the iron atom was readily determined. Experimental phases were subsequently improved by use of the density modification protocol implemented in Resolve.29 The experimental maps were readily interpretable; 120 amino acids (80%) of the total sequence and the heme were fitted into the initial electron density. Subsequent rounds of structural refinement and model building with Quanta (Accelrys, Inc.) and Refmac30 led to tracing of most of the protein primary sequence (amino acids 3­150) and the addition of 116 water molecules (see Table I for model statistics). The geometry of the final model is excellent; 90.8% of the residues lie in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, with 6.9% positioned in other allowed regions and only 2.3%, i.e., three residues, in generously allowed regions. Of these three residues, two (Asp81, Leu82) are located in a very mobile loop, and one (Asp149) is at the C terminus. The C and N termini as well as loops 41­51 and 77­ 85 are more

mobile than the rest of the structure and consequently show higher B-factors. Quality check on the structure was performed using PROCHECK,30 data evaluation, transformation and refinement was carried out using programs from the CCP4 suite,31 structure visualization was carried out using Quanta and InsightII (Accelrys, Inc.). Cavity calculations and visualization were carried out using Surfnet32. The program defines gap regions by first filling the empty regions between atoms with gap-spheres. It then uses these to compute a 3D density map which, when contoured, defines the surface; the range used for gap spheres was 1.0 ­3.0 Å. Structure factors and coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank in July 2003 and have the accession number 1Q1F. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION General Features of the Structure The tertiary structure consists of 8 -helices embedding the heme prosthetic group. The main helices are organized into a two-layer structure, recognized as a three-overthree -helical sandwich.16,33,34 The heme iron is hexacoordinated by four pyrrole N atoms within the heme plane, the distal histidine His64(E7) and the proximal histidine His96(F8). This geometry was clearly visible from the first electron density map produced after SAD phasing and density modification. A search in the Protein Data Bank for the closest structural relative using DALI33 and CE35 yielded in both cases sperm whale myoglobin (swMb, 2MGL and 1A6M), with the lowest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for C superposition of 2.00 Å and 15­17% identity in the structurally aligned sequences. We also carried out a structural superposition with rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin (nsHb, 1D8U) which yielded a comparable result, (RMSD 2.24 Å, 17% identity) upon exclusion of the short N-terminal extension of nsHb. Therefore, despite its low sequence similarity (less that 25%) with vertebrate globins, Ngb clearly exhibits the architecture of this family. Structural superposition of Ngb with swMb and nsHb by automatic alignment of C atoms is shown in Figure 1(a and c). If one superimposes the Ngb and nsHb structures using the porphyrin frame, it is apparent that the common feature of heme hexacoordination includes a similar arrangement of the rigid heme-helixE-helixF system,36 including the orientation of His(E7) and His(F8) with respect to the heme atoms and the packing of the second half of the A helix onto helix F [Fig. 1(d)]. The other segments of Ngb and nsHb, however, are no longer optimally superimposed. Superposition of Ngb and swMb by the porphyrin frame, however, slightly enhances the different geometries of the heme-helixE-helixF systems and still yields satisfactory alignment of the rest of the proteins [Fig. 1(b)]. In Ngb, the distal His64(E7) is shifted 2.38 Å closer to the heme iron with respect to pentacoordinated swMb. This shift can be ascribed to a rotation of the E helix around a pivot point at position Leu70(E13), for which the C positions are only

0.13 Å apart. This rotation separates the N and C tips of the E helices by 3.79 and 2.92 Å, respectively. Structural Heterogeneity at the Binding Site Given the close resemblance of Ngb with swMb, it was rather unexpected to find the main heme orientation within the Ngb protein moiety 180° rotated with respect to the ­ meso axis. Even with this orientation, we still encountered difficulties in refining the heme iron position. Moreover, close inspection of the electron density maps revealed an expanded shape of the methyl groups in position 1 and 3, consistent with partial vinyl group occupancy. These findings suggested significant heterogeneity of the heme orientation, in agreement with recent solution NMR data by Du et al.37 who reported heme orientational disorder for metNgb, with an approximately 2:1 predominance of the inverted geometry. By introducing a second, minor conformer (30% occupancy) in the "canonical" swMb insertion mode (Fig. 2) we could indeed refine the heme satisfactorily. We have carefully analyzed the structure to identify the determinants of this unusual feature. Amino acids in close vicinity to the prosthetic group include Phe42(CD1), Leu92(F4), Val101(FG5), and Leu41(C7). There are no steric clashes with these residues in both heme orientations, and there is no obvious selectivity due to these residues. Phe42(CD1) is slightly disordered, as seen from its large B factors (Fig. 3). It also has a less well defined appearance in the electron density map. This residue is located at the border of the disordered CD loop, and reorganization of this loop may accompany ligand binding. In fact, the mobility of this region may be responsible for the low heme selectivity. Consistent with this hypothesis, Du et al.37 reported a shift of the ratio of the two heme orientations from about 2:1 to about 1:1 upon cyanide binding. Another factor that reduces selectivity for a particular heme orientation is the lack of heme contacts at the methyl/vinyl B pyrrole side, opposite to the edge where Phe42(CD1) resides. This side of the heme provides some of the atoms that line a large cavity in Ngb, formed mainly by helices F and G. In swMb and nsHb, this cavity is reduced or absent. In conjunction with the two heme conformations, the proximal His96(F8) and distal His64(E7) were also refined as two conformers, with the same 70:30 ratio of occupancies (Fig. 4). The reliability of the structural data is obviously higher for the dominant conformer A, which shows a more planar heme geometry, with a 0.20 Å out-of-plane displacement of the iron in the distal direction, similar to nsHb.23 The iron position with respect to the heme plane is a major structural determinant of reactivity towards the ligand,38 and a shift of the iron towards the distal side is consistent with the unexpected ligand affinity of Ngb.39 The geometry of the His64(E7)N Fe-His96(F8)N unit is nearly linear (177.3°), with distances of 1.9 and 2.2 Å between heme the iron and His64(E7) and His96(F8), respectively. By contrast, in conformer B, the iron is displaced by 0.27 Å towards the proximal side, and the angle defined by the two axial ligands and the iron is 156.0°; the distance between Fe and

His64(E7) is 2.1 Å, and the one between Fe and His96(E8) is 1.9 Å. The increased Fe-His64(E7) distance and the significantly distorted axial coordination may be consistent with less stable hexacoordination. Moreover, the different heme conformers support the heterogeneity observed in spectroscopic investigations.17­19 The distal pocket of Ngb, formed by residues Phe28(B10), Phe42(CD1) and Val68(E11), is hydrophobic in character except for His64(E7), the residue that prevents access of an exogenous ligand to the sixth coordination at the heme iron. Another functionally important residue is Lys67(E10). It is not unusual to find lysine or arginine at this position in the globin fold, as seen for example in Aplysia limacina Mb40 and Ascaris suum Hb.41 The long Lys67(E10) side chain presents a barrier to ligand exit and entry by forming a very stable salt bridge with one of the heme propionates (distance 2.7 Å), which is reinforced by a close contact to the hydroxyl group of Tyr44(CD3) and to a water molecule (Wat3 in Figure 4). Only upon disruption of this network can the distal histidine swing out of the distal pocket, an event which may cost up to 1.7 kcal/mol.42,43 In the crystal lattice, there are additional interactions formed by the second heme propionate and Lys67(E10), due to contact with a symmetry-related protein molecule, which brings them to a distance of 2.7 Å (Lys67(E10)NZhemeO1A). Hydrophobic Cavities in Ngb and Other Globins The B factors of the C atoms and averages over the side-chain atoms are plotted in Figure 3. The core of the tertiary structure is well defined and covered by highquality density structure, with the exception of a few residues at the C- and N-termini and the CD (41­51) and EF (77­ 85) corners. These two junctions between helical segments, though being continuous in the main chain electron density, posed problems in side-chain positioning (especially Asp81, Leu82, Ser83 and Ser84). Mobility of the CD corner was also observed in nsHb,23 where it is probably correlated with rearrangements induced by ligand binding. In Ngb, there are short C and D helices that are absent in the plant protein; therefore, movements of the CD loop should be of lesser extent in Ngb. The marked

mobility of the EF loop seen in Ngb (but absent in nsHb), seems to be correlated with a peculiar feature of Ngb, namely the presence of a large cavity at the heme side opposite to Phe42(CD1) which extends towards its distal side (Fig. 5), observed also in human Ngb.16 Internal cavities have been extensively studied in globins. We have calculated and compared the volumes of the cavities in the structures of Ngb, nsHb, and swMb, using the program Surfnet.32 In swMb, structure analysis of crystals exposed to xenon revealed four cavities, a distal one (Xe4), two located at the heme rim (Xe2 and Xe3) and another on the proximal side (Xe1).44 The volumes of Xe1-4 are 98.6, 70.0, 62.9 and 26.6 Å3, respectively, as determined by Bossa et al. (manuscript in preparation). Recently, this cavity network has been studied extensively. Using site-directed mutagenesis or Xe to block migration pathways and fill the cavities, their role in ligand migration and binding was analyzed in detail.45­50 It became apparent that these cavities play a crucial role in Mb, governing ligand dynamics and reactivity, because ligands transiently occupy these sites on their migration through the protein matrix. In nsHb we found only two cavities, located on the distal side of the heme, with volumes (62.4 Å3 and 11.3 Å3) smaller than the swMb distal side cavities. Ngb also displays two cavities on the distal side, a small apolar one, corresponding to Xe4 in Mb (15.9 Å3) and an even smaller polar one (11.3 Å3), which is in contact with the distal His64(E7) and hosts a water molecule (Wat9). The most interesting feature, however, is the presence of a third, huge cavity with a volume of 287.2 Å3 (see Figure 5), corresponding to a fusion of the Xe2 and Xe1 cavities of swMb. This open volume connects the heme distal and proximal sides and has a highly hydrophobic character. This major "packing defect" is likely to be responsible for the lacking specificity for heme insertion in Ngb. More importantly, it may also be a crucial determinant for the function and dynamics of Ngb, because close inspection of the Xe1/2 cavity reveals a connection with the external surface of the protein through a channel flanked by Tyr88(F3). Although the orifice of this channel is fairly narrow in the crystal structure, it should allow easy access of diatomic ligands to the cavity, given the mobility of the EF corner that constitutes its "external wall." Similar channels have been detected in Cerebratulus lacteus hemoglobin51 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis hemoglobin,52 and their possible role in understanding the function of these proteins has been discussed.51 Modeling Exogenous Ligand Binding to Ngb The presence of His64(E7) at the sixth coordination of the heme iron requires displacement of this side chain upon exogenous ligand binding [Fig. 6(a)]. Inspection of the distal side structure reveals two alternative modes to remove the endogenous imidazole ligand from the sixth coordination (Fig. 6): (1) it may either swing deeper into the distal pocket and dock in the cavity occupied by Wat9, or (2) it may swing out of the distal pocket, with concomitant breakage of the hydrogen bond

network involving Tyr44(CD3), Lys67(E10), heme propionate and Wat3 (Fig. 4). Figure 6(b) shows that rotation of the His64(E7) imidazole, by a change of the 1 angle from the experimentally determined value of 178.1° found in the met hexacoordinated state to 114.5°, is sufficient to almost entirely remove the overlap with the modeled ligand (introduced on the basis of the swMb oxy structure). This movement would necessitate expulsion of Wat9 from its cavity, but only modest rearrangements of the residues lining the cavity itself (Phe61(E3), Phe28(B10), and Phe42(CD1)); the latter two residues are two of the close heme contacts. Therefore, their reorientations would account for heme orientational disorder and rearrangement upon ligand binding.37

In the second mechanism, the distal histidine may swing towards the exterior [Fig. 6(c)]. This model was originally introduced for Mb3 and later also invoked for other heme proteins.53 In Ngb, changing the 1 angle of His64(E7) to 72.5° makes the distal pocket available for exogenous ligand binding. However, in this scenario, the imidazole side chain would collide with the heme propionate, Lys67(E10) and Tyr44(CD3), involved in the electrostatic/ hydrogen bonding network depicted in Figure 4. Rearrangement of the mobile CD loop and sliding of the F helix, made possible by the mobile EF corner, could facilitate opening the way for the His64(E7) "swinging out" movement. An infrared study of CO binding to ferrous Ngb provides clear evidence for these two mechanisms of His64(E7) move-

ment. Up to four CO stretching bands with pH-dependent amplitudes, known to arise from multiple His64(E7) conformers,18 can be distinguished. At neutral and high pH, only two bands are visible, A1 at 1940 cm 1 and A2 at 1980 cm 1. The frequency of the dominant A1 conformer ( 80%) is typical of globins, in which the His64(E7) imidazole places an imino hydrogen near the CO oxygen. In swMbCO, for example, the dominant conformer at neutral pH is characterized by an A1 band at 1945 cm 1. An additional shift to 1940 cm 1 is expected for NgbCO because of the presence of Phe28(B10). In MbCO, both Phe and Tyr replacements of Leu29(B10) cause a shift of the CO stretching band to lower frequency. The exceptionally high CO stretching frequency of the A2 conformer in Ngb can be assigned to the imidazole tautomeric state, in which the proton sits on the other nitrogen. As a consequence, the lone-pair on the nitrogen would point towards the CO oxygen, causing an up-shift in frequency. These infrared observations provide clear evidence of mechanism 1 at physiological pH, in which the distal histidine moves deeper into the distal heme pocket upon ligand binding, as shown in Figure 6(b). At low pH, two additional bands appear in the infrared spectrum of NgbCO; they are denoted as A0 (1970 cm 1) and A3 (1925 cm 1). By comparison with swMbCO, A0 can be assigned to a conformation in which the distal histidine has swung out of the distal pocket, as described by our mechanism 2 [Fig. 6(c)]. This interpretation is supported by the observation that replacement of the imidazole by an aliphatic side chain in Ngb mutant His64(E7)L yields a single infrared band at 1971 cm 1 (Nienhaus et al., unpublished). As with the A1 conformation, the low frequency of A3 can be explained by the presence of a positive charge in the vicinity of the CO oxygen. But since the imidazole has swung out of the distal pocket after protonation, it cannot be responsible for this effect. Rather, we suggest that a water molecule enters the pocket and resides near the location of Wat9. Its hydrogen can then interact with the CO oxygen so as to shift its frequency. In addition to the His64(E7) gate,54 the tunnel to the large Xe1/2 pocket in the Ngb structure offers an alternate entry and exit route for ligands. In this case, swinging motion of the His64(E7) would follow ligand entry to enable binding rather than being a prerequisite for ligand access to the distal pocket. CONCLUSIONS The structure of mouse ferric (or met) Ngb at 1.5 Å resolution provides the structural framework necessary for unraveling its hitherto unresolved physiological function. Moreover, it allows one to correlate kinetic and spectroscopic data available on Ngb to its molecular properties. In the crystal structure, the heme is observed to be inserted into the protein in two different orientations, with an occupancy ratio of 70:30; the major conformer in Ngb is the species normally absent in native swMb. This characteristic was suggested but not systematically analyzed in the structure of hNgb,16 possibly due to its lower resolution. The lack of orientational selectivity is possibly related to the presence of a very large cavity lining the heme

and to the increased mobility of crucial heme contacts. Another significant source of heterogeneity, well documented kinetically and spectroscopically,18,37 arises from multiple conformations of the imidazole side chain of His64(E7). Upon binding of an exogenous ligand, the imidazole is expected to move away from the sixth coordination by rotating either towards the interior or the exterior of the distal pocket. Mobility of the CD and EF corners also appears necessary to make the distal site available for ligation and enlarge the connection of the very large Xe1/2 cavity with the external medium. This cavity provides an entry and exit route for ligands; it can host photodissociated ligands in a vast, structurally diverse environment, in agreement with the complex dynamics observed in flash photolysis experiments.18,55 Interestingly, it bifurcates at the level of the heme rim (Fig. 5) allowing access to both proximal and distal sides which raises the question whether proximal ligand binding might be possible, especially with nitric oxide. The coexistence of diverse binding and access modes to the heme iron, the accessory entry path, and heme hexacoordination might constitute a sort of "molecular fossil" reminiscent of a redox catalytic function of the globin fold. Ngb might be involved in NO metabolism in the nervous tissue, which can become crucial in case of hypoxic events, as shown in vivo.14 These data make Ngb a novel target for devising new strategies to minimize the effects of stroke. Our high-resolution structure of mouse Ngb may become crucial to achieve a detailed understanding of its functional role in the brain. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Dr. C. Bossa and Dr. S.
