The structure of the human tRNALys3 anticodon stem and loop domain (ASLLys3) provides evidence of the physicochemical contributions of N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A37) to tRNALys3 functions. The t6A37-modified anticodon stem and loop domain of tRNALys3UUU (ASLLys3UUU- t6A37) with a UUU anticodon is bound by the appropriately programmed ribosomes, but the unmodified ASLLys3UUU is not [Yarian, C., Marszalek, M., Sochacka, E., Malkiewicz, A., Guenther, R., Miskiewicz, A., and Agris, P. F., Biochemistry 39, 13390-13395]. The structure, determined to an average rmsd of 1.57 ( 0.33 Å (relative to the mean structure) by NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics, is the first reported of an RNA in which a naturally occurring hypermodified nucleoside was introduced by automated chemical synthesis. The ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 loop is significantly different than that of the unmodified ASLLys3UUU, although the five canonical base pairs of both ASLLys3UUU stems are in the standard A-form of helical RNA. t6A37, 3-adjacent to the anticodon, adopts the form of a tricyclic nucleoside with an intraresidue H-bond and enhances base stacking on the 3-side of the anticodon loop. Critically important to ribosome binding, incorporation of the modification negates formation of an intraloop U33,A37 base pair that is observed in the unmodified ASLLys3UUU. The anticodon wobble position U34 nucleobase in ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 is significantly displaced from its position in the unmodified ASL and directed away from the codon-binding face of the loop resulting in only two anticodon bases for codon binding. This conformation is one explanation for ASLLys3UUU tendency to prematurely terminate translation and -1 frame shift. At the pH 5.6 conditions of our structure determination, A38 is protonated and positively charged in ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 and the unmodified ASLLys3UUU. The ionized carboxylic acid moiety of t6A37 possibly neutralizes the positive charge of A+38. The protonated A+38 can base pair with C32, but t6A37 may weaken the interaction through steric interference. From these results, we conclude that ribosome binding cannot simply be an induced fit of the anticodon stem and loop, otherwise the unmodified ASLLys3UUU would bind as well as ASLLys3UUU-t6A37. t6A37 and other position 37 modifications produce the open, structured loop required for ribosomal binding.
ABSTRACT:

Lysine tRNAs with UUU anticodons have a conventional role in ribosome-mediated protein synthesis. In addition, tRNALysUUU species facilitate -1 frameshifts for correct translation of the E. coli DNA polymerase  subunit (1) and retroviral polymerases (2). Also, tRNALysUUU often misreads asparagine codons (3, 4) and peptidyl-tRNALys prematurely terminates translation more often than other tRNAs (5). In addition, reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genomic RNA is primed by the human tRNALys3UUU. Formation of the viral replication initiation complex is enhanced in vitro by the

presence of the tRNA's modified nucleosides (6, 7) and strand transfer is facilitated by the anticodon's modified nucleosides (8). We hypothesized that anticodon domain modified nucleosides impart the unique chemical and structural properties required to explain the standard (9), as well as the unconventional, roles of tRNALysUUU in protein synthesis and as primer for HIV replication (10). Two posttranscriptional modifications in the anticodon loop distinguish tRNALysUUU from other tRNALys species and from other tRNAs, in general. In human tRNALys3UUU, position 34 is modified to 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2thiouridine (mcm5s2U34)1 and A37 is modified to 2-methylthio-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (ms2t6A37). There is only one lysine tRNA in E. coli, tRNALysUUU, and its anticodon stem and loop sequence closely resembles that of human tRNALys3UUU. In E. coli tRNALysUUU, U34 and A37 are modified to 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U) and t6A, respectively. Posttranscriptional modifications of

t6A Inhibits tRNALys3 Anticodon Loop Base Pair

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 44, 2000 13397 butylsilyl-3-15N3-uridine phosphoramidite was synthesized as previously described (17) and the protected 5-trityl-2dimethyltertbutylsilyl-3-phosphoramidite of t6A was prepared in our laboratories (unpublished). All other nucleoside phosphoramidites were obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). The oligomer was HPLC-purified as previously described (17) using a Nucleogen 60-7 DEAE (250 × 10 mm) column, and its nucleoside composition determined (18). Sample desalting was accomplished with Waters Corporation Sep-pak columns. The sample was prepared for NMR spectroscopy by extensive dialysis with buffer (10 mM cacodylate buffer, pH 5.6, 0.1 mM EDTA, 6% D2O/94% H2O) using Amicon Centricon 3 concentrators. For experiments in D2O, the sample solution was evaporated down with N2 and exchanged with D2O three times before resuspending the sample in 99.96% D2O. The samples used for structural analysis had a final RNA concentration of 1.2 mM. Methods: (i) ASL Thermodynamic Parameters. ASLLys3UUU samples were dissolved to a concentration of 2 µM in either a phosphate or cacodylate buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate or 10 mM sodium cacodylate, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, with the pH adjusted with HCl). Thermal denaturations, performed in triplicate, were monitored by UV absorbance (260 nm) using a Cary 3 spectrophotometer as previously described (19). Data points were averaged over 20 s and collected three times a minute. Denaturations and renaturations were conducted over a temperature range of 5-90 °C and at three pH values (7.2, 6.0, and 5.0) with a ramp rate of 1 °C/min. Data from denaturations and renaturations were treated similarly. No hysteresis was observed. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated with a van't Hoff analysis of the data as described by Serra and Turner (20) using Origin software (Microcal). Substitution of the U27,A43 terminal base pair with a G27,C43 added stability to the molecule. A pH between 5.0 and 6.0 was deemed to be optimal for stability and pH 5.6 was chosen for NMR studies. (ii) Unimolecular Property of Samples. To demonstrate that the RNA was a monomer at the NMR concentrations of this study, we measured the translational diffusion coefficient of the unmodified and t6A37-modified ASLs, and compared them to that of other RNA sequences of various lengths. This was accomplished with the pulsed field-gradient spin-echo technique (21, 22), performed on the NMR sample itself, thereby obviating any complications or ambiguities of interpretation that may arise from approaches other than that by NMR methods (23). As would be expected for a monomer of this size, the translational diffusion coefficient of the heptadecamer was bracketed by those measured for a hexamer and a dodecamer, and by that of a 28-mer. Our results are in good agreement with published values of the translational diffusion coefficients of nucleic acids of similar sizes (23, 24). (iii) NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer and processed using either XWINNMR (Bruker Inc., Rheinstetten, Germany) or FELIX (Biosym/MSI, San Diego, CA). The residual water peak in D2O samples was suppressed using low power presaturation whereas exchangeable proton resonances for samples in 94% H2O/6% D2O were collected at 1 °C with WATERGATE (25) solvent suppression. Eight one-dimensional spectra as a function of temperature between 4 and 31 °C and three

the tRNALysUUU anticodon loop, but not those of the anticodon stem, are important for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase recognition and aminoacylation of cognate tRNA (11) and for ribosomal binding (12, 13). Recently, we determined that the individual modifications of the tRNALysUUU anticodon loop, s2U34, mnm5U34 (of mnm5s2U34) and t6A37, restored AAA-programmed ribosomal binding to the otherwise unmodified and nonfunctional human tRNALys3UUU anticodon stem and loop domain (13, 14, preceding paper in this issue). Here we report the structure of the human tRNALys3UUU anticodon stem and loop with the amino acid modification, t6A37 (ASLLys3UUU-t6A37), which is critical to its ribosome binding function (14). Structures of the unmodified ASLLys3UUU and the stem modified ASLLys3UUU-39 have been reported (15), but neither bind the ribosome (14). We compare the structure of the functional ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 to that of the nonfunctional, unmodified ASLLys3UUU. The hypermodified nucleoside has a pronounced effect on the anticodon loop conformation as determined from NMR-derived distance and torsion angle restraints using restrained molecular dynamics. The structure explains the role of t6A in achieving an anticodon architecture required for ribosome binding, as well as the unique properties displayed by tRNALysUUU species. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials: Sample Preparation. The heptadecamer oligoribonucleotides corresponding to the unmodified and N6threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A37)-modified sequence of the human tRNALys3UUU anticodon stem and loop domain, ASLLys3UUU (Figure 1) were chemically synthesized using standard phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA/RNA Synthesizer (16). The 5 to 3 terminal base pair was changed from the native sequence 27,A43 to G27,C43 for the increased yield and increased stability necessary for NMR analysis.

13398 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 44, 2000 HSQC spectra at three pH values were obtained to aid signal assignments and assess protonation of A38. NOESY spectra (26, 27) used for analysis of the exchangeable protons were acquired with a mixing time of 150 ms. Spectra were acquired with sweep widths of 12019 Hz in both dimensions, 4096 points in t2, and a minimum of 512 points in t1 with 64 scans per increment. Nonexchangeable protons were assigned using an assortment of two-dimensional spectra acquired at 10, 16, and 25 °C. NOESY spectra of the sample in D2O had mixing times in the range of 50 to 400 ms. At least 256 points were collected in t1, with 64 scans per increment. For these and the following homonuclear experiments, the spectral width was 6000 Hz in both dimensions, and 1024 points were collected in t2. TOCSY (28) or clean TOCSY (29) experiments using the MLEV17 mixing sequence were performed at 16 °C with a mixing time of 60 ms. DQF-COSY (30) and double quantum (DQ) (31, 32) experiments were obtained at 16 °C. The two-dimensional heteronuclear spectra that were collected included a 1H-31P HETCOR (33) and a hetero-TOCSY-NOESY (34). These spectra were all acquired at 16 °C. Natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC experiments (35-37) were performed at both 16 and 25 °C. For samples with site-specific 15N labels, 1H-15N HSQC spectra were obtained in H2O at 1 °C. Distance restraints were derived from a series of phase sensitive NOESY spectra acquired with a 5000 Hz spectral width in both dimensions, 2048 points in t2 and 512 points with 64 scans per block in t1. Spectra were collected at 16 °C with mixing times of 50, 100, 140, 200, and 400 ms and processed (XWINNMR) with 60° phase-shifted sine bell apodization functions. The baseline in both dimensions was treated in FELIX using the FLATT algorithm (38). To provide suitable digital resolution for cross-peak integration, the spectra were zero-filled to 2048 by 1024 points. (iV) Structure Determination. Distance restraints between nonexchangeable protons were obtained from the NOESY mixing time study. The NOE buildup curves were calculated by integrating the cross-peaks using FELIX and normalized by setting pyrimidine H5-H6 cross-peaks to a distance of 2.44 Å. Upper and lower bounds were set to the 20% above or below the calculated distance using flat-bottomed quadratic potentials. Cross-peaks with more than 35% overlap were classified strong (1.8-4 Å), medium (1.8-5 Å), or weak (1.8-6 Å) with large bounds to account for ambiguity of the peaks volume measurement. Threonine methyl protons of t6A were handled as pseudo atoms and adjusted accordingly (39). The distance restraints involving exchangeable resonances were obtained from a single NOESY spectrum of the sample in 94% H2O/6% D2O. The cross-peaks were qualitatively classified as strong (1.8-3.5 Å), medium (1.84.5 Å), or weak (1.8-5.5 Å). Dihedral angle restraints were placed on the  backbone (C5-C4-C3-O3) to characterize the sugar puckers based on the 3JH1H2 from the DQF-COSY spectrum. Observable H1-H2 cross-peaks with coupling constants less than 3 Hz were constrained to the C3-endo conformation ( ) 85 ( 30°) while those with coupling constants greater than 7 Hz were constrained to the C2-endo conformation ( ) 160 ( 30°). Sugars with intermediate coupling constants were left unrestrained. The R and torsion angles were loosely constrained to exclude the trans conformation for those

residues whose 31P chemical shifts fell within the narrow range commonly seen for regular A-form structures (40, 41). Last to better define the hydrogen-bonding pattern, distance restraints were added to the five base pairs in the stem and through-space dihedral restraints ((10°) were added to maintain planar bases. Structure calculations were preformed using InsightII (MSI) and protocols of Varani and others (40, 42). To achieve the global fold of the molecule, 50 initial distance geometry structures were generated from a matrix of random trial distances derived from covalent bonds, distance, dihedral angle, and chiral restraints. The resulting structures were regularized as part of the distance geometry protocol by simulated annealing using the default settings in InsightII. For the refinement phase, the AMBER force field (43) was used with the standard nucleoside parameters except for the modified nucleoside t6A37 and adenosine protonated at the 1 position (A+38). The state of t6A at pH 5.6 with the carboxylic acid dissociated (44-46) was used to determine its partial charges, which were calculated from scaled MOPAC charges (47, 48). Its atom types were derived by merging the existing AMBER atom types for adenine with that of threonine (43). The set of 50 distance geometry structures was heated to 2000 K for 5 ps with a 0.5 fs time step. During this equilibration step, the dihedral and chiral restraints (kdiheral ) 50 kcal mol-1 rad-2, kchiral ) 25 kcal mol-1 rad-2) were scaled from 10% to their full value while the distance restraints remained at 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2. Next, the structures were cooled from 2000 to 100 K over 25 ps with a time step of 0.5 fs during which all restraints were maintained at their full values. Longer simulation times did not improve the convergence of the lowest energy structures. RESULTS Thermodynamic Parameters. The anticodon stem and loop domain of human tRNALys3UUU, ASLLys3UUU (Figure 1), was chemically synthesized with and without the threoninemodified adenosine N6-threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine, t6A37. At pH 7.2, the unmodified ASLLys3UUU had a significantly higher melting temperature (Tm ) 57.5 °C) and enhanced overall stability (G ) -3.4 kcal/mol) than the ASLLys3UUUt6A37 (Tm ) 54.7 °C and G ) -2.7 kcal/mol) (Table 1). Interestingly, the introduction of t6A37 made a significant contribution to S, though the Tm of the RNA had decreased. The two RNAs exhibited greater stability at pH 6 than at pH 7.2 or pH 5.0 (Table 1 and ref 14). The increased stability and NMR-derived solution structures of the unmodified and 39-containing heptadecamers at low pH had already been reported and attributed to a C32,A+38 base pair (15). At the

lower pH 5.0, protonation of Cs destabilizes the RNAs. Thus, we determined the ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 structure at pH 5.6 by NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics. Assignment of Exchangeable Resonances. The onedimensional and NOESY spectra of the unmodified and modified ASLs in H2O revealed that the ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 was stable and had a single predominant conformation (Figure 2). Sequential imino-imino connectivities for the stem were observed, indicating that the RNA adopted a folded structure. As is often the case, however, due to fraying, these sequential connectivities did not extend to the terminal base pair, G27,C43. The broad signal of the base-paired G27 was visible in both the one-dimensional and NOESY spectra (Figure 2). In addition to the imino resonances of the stem, t6A37 H11, corresponding to the amide NH of threonine, had cross-peaks to the amino acid's HR and H and the purine's H2 (Figure 2B). This is the pattern one would expect with a side-chain coplanar to the parent base (49, 50) and results in the modified nucleoside adopting the form of a tricyclic base. When the NOESY spectrum of the imino to amino region of the ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 was compared to that of the unmodified sequence, a very similar pattern of resonance cross-peaks (except that contributed by t6A) was observed with very little change in the chemical shifts. Likewise, comparison of other parts of the spectrum showed small changes in the chemical shifts of the resonances assigned to the stem, but considerably larger differences to the loop resonances. Cross-peaks observed in the imino to imino, and imino to amino, aromatic, and H1 regions of the spectra were those expected of right-handed, helical nucleic acids (35, 51). This implies that the t6A37 modification did little to perturb the stem of the hairpin, but significantly affected the conformation of the loop region. At pH 5.6, the N1 of A38 is protonated in the unmodified ASLLys3UUU (15). Though this imino proton may be involved in a hydrogen bond with C32 and thereby increase stability as was observed in thermal

denaturation studies at pH 6 compared to 7.2, it was not directly observable by NMR. However, a pH dependent change in the chemical shift of the A38H2, indicative of the protonation of the base (15), was observed in HSQC (1H13C) spectra of both the unmodified ASLLys3 UUU and ASLLys3UUU-t6A37. Thus, introduction of t6A37 did not affect protonation of A38. While most signals of the spectra could be assigned using standard protocols, site-specific substitutions of 15N-labeled nucleosides of the unmodified ASLLys3UUU were used to confirm or to identify the imino proton resonances of the uridine-rich loop. We were able to unambiguously identify the imino protons of loop residues U34, U35 and U36 (Figure 2A). Comparison of the one-dimensional spectra of the t6A37modified and unmodified hairpin indicated a major rearrangement of the loop uridines with the introduction of t6A37. In the one- and two-dimensional spectra of the unmodified ASLLys3UUU, a base-paired imino resonance at 13.55 ppm was assigned to U33. This was the only imino proton unaccounted for by standard and 15N-labeling procedures. Its position in the spectrum was that of a canonical U,A base pair that we assigned to U33,A37 in the unmodified ASL. However, the signal was not observed in spectra of ASLLys3UUU-t6A37. Instead, a fourth free-imino signal from a uridine was observed between 10.9 and 11.4 ppm. This is the expected result from modification of the exocyclic amine of A37 because t6A37 would be unable to form a canonical base pair with U33. Thus, the introduction of t6A37 negated an intraloop U33,A37 base pair that was observable in the unmodified ASLLys3UUU. Loss of the intraloop base pair was probably responsible for the lower Tm of ASLLys3UUU-t6A37, relative to that of the unmodified ASLLys3UUU (Table 1). Assignment of Nonexchangeable Resonances. Assignment of the nonexchangeable resonances relied on a variety of homo- and heteronuclear experiments. Initial assignment of the aromatic H5-H6 protons relied on assigned nonex-

changeable resonances and both DQF-COSY and TOCSY experiments. Differentiation of cytidine from the uracil aromatic protons was aided by natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC spectra. Cross-peaks from HSQC spectra were used to identify H1 protons and distinguished adenosine H2 from purine H8 and pyrimidine H6 resonances. Both adenosines in the stem (A29 and A31) had NOE cross-peaks from H2 to the H1 proton of their 3 neighbor and A29 also had an interstrand cross-peak to the H1 of the 5-adjacent base pair. Comparison to NOESY spectra of the sample in H2O enabled us to assign the adenosine H2 resonances. Sequential aromatic-H1 connectivities of the NOESY spectrum (in D2O) could be traced for most of the molecule (Figure 3). As in the stem, A38 and t6A37 stacked as indicated by NOEs to the H1 of their 3 neighbor. Several unique cross-peaks were also observed. There was a cross-peak from the t6A37H2 to the methyl of the side chain (H) and an unexpected NOE from A38H2 across the loop to both H1 and H2 of C32. Sequential aromatic-H1 connectivities could be traced from the 5 terminus of the stem to the first residue of the loop, C32 (Figure 3). At that point there was a break in the sequential connectivity that included the invariant U33. Though NOEs were observed between U35 and U36, sequential aromatic to H1 connectivities began again at t6A37 and continued to the 3-terminal C43 (Figure 3). In the longer mixing time NOESY spectrum (400 ms), sequential connectivities between the nucleobase aromatics (H6, H8) were observed. These connectivities were apparent on the 5 side of the stem from G27 to A31 and on the 3 side of the loop from t6A37 up to the 3 terminus, with one exception. The chemical shift of C40H6 was too close to its neighbors to be resolved reliably from the diagonal. Similar to the lack of aromatic to H1 connectivities, no sequential aromatic-toaromatic resonances were observed from residue A31 through t6A37.

Identification of three uridine nucleoside spin systems of the anticodon (U34, U35, U36) was hindered by overlap in the spectra and a lack of resolvable intraresidue aromatic to ribose NOEs. Several long distance NOEs from already identified nucleosides in the loop to anticodon uridines were chosen for distance geometry analysis to determine the most likely uridine spin system assignment. A set of distance geometry calculations was performed with all assigned distance restraints and one interresidue restraint from an assigned resonance to an unassigned uracil. Then 60 structures were generated with three distance restraint sets (e.g., from A38H2 to either U34H1, U35H1, or U36H1). After steepest decent minimization, the sets of structures were evaluated based on their total energy and magnitude of restraint violations. Assignment of an NOE to a particular anticodon uridine spin system was accomplished by eliminating those possibilities that yielded highly distorted geometries or high-energy structures. Both DQF-COSY and TOCSY experiments were used to assign H1 and H2 resolvable cross-peaks. H1-H2 crosspeaks in the DQF-COSY spectrum were observed for loop residues, U33 to t6A37, and for C43. The most intense H1/ H2 cross-peaks were residues U33 to U36. A short mixing time (50 ms) NOESY spectrum also aided in determining H2 resonances. The H3 of the riboses were assigned using the above spectra and the 1H-31P HETCOR spectrum. The same experiments were used to determine more than half of the H4 and H5/5 protons. NOE and Dihedral Angle Restraints. A total of 272 distance and dihedral angle restraints were used in the structure calculations (Table 2). Of the 220 NOE-derived restraints, there were 117 intranucleotide and 103 internucleotide distance restraints. Thirteen restraints were derived from exchangeable proton spectra and were added to mimic the hydrogen-bonding pattern of the stem and to limit fraying

Residues U33, U34, and U36 had H1-H2 coupling constants greater than 7 Hz and therefore were constrained to the C2-endo range. In contrast, the stem residues had narrow H1-H2 (<2 Hz) cross-peaks, and were constrained to the C3-endo range. Where the H3-H4 cross-peaks could be easily identified, a large coupling constant was observed. Residues with intermediate coupling constants, U35, t6A37, and A+38, were left unconstrained. On the basis of the 31P chemical shifts of all residues, their corresponding R and torsion angles were loosely constrained to exclude the trans conformation, with the exceptions of U33 and U34, which were left unrestrained.

A superposition of the 10 lowest energy structures of the ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 resulted in an average pairwise rmsd of 2.30 ( 0.67 Å for all heavy atoms of the molecule (Figure 5A). The five base paired stem of ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 adopted the form of A-RNA, and all stem nucleosides of the 10 lowest energy structures were C3-endo. Only U33, U34, and U36 of the loop were found to be strongly C2-endo. Sixteen glycosidic angles were found to be anti, though no torsion angle restraints were used. Relative to the mean structure, the average rmsd was 1.57 ( 0.33 Å. The stem was much better defined than the loop. The heavy atom average pairwise rmsd of the stem was 0.76 ( 0.20 Å, while that of the loop was 3.07 ( 1.07 Å. Relative to the mean structure, the average rmsd was 0.52 ( 0.14 Å and 2.13 ( 0.52 Å for the stem and loop, respectively. The better rmsd relative to the average structure reflects that there were two somewhat different families of low energy structures. One family had U33 stacked below C32 while the second group of structures had U33 placed adjacent to U34. Similarly in determination of the structure of another sevenmembered loop, that of the yeast tRNAPhe TC loop, we found two almost equally populated families of structures with m5U54 (T54) either within the loop or displayed outwardly (42). The H8/H1 NOE between C32 and U33 in ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 is weaker than an H8/H1 internucleotide NOE for A-form RNA. With U33 being the terminal base in the stacking on the 5 side of the stem, weak base stacking could best account for the weaker NOE. For structure comparisons, we used a minimized average of the structures with C32 and U33 stacked (Figure 5B). RNA hairpins have an angle between the plane of the loop and the axis of the stem that can only be defined by structural restraints between the loop and stem. A number of NOE cross-peaks are derived from C32 on the 5-side of the loop and t6A37 and A38 on the 3-side of the loop with the adjacent A31-U39 stem base pair. Restraints from these NOEs structure the loop locally at the junction with the stem (Figure 5C) in an angle of 133°, comparable to the 113° of the yeast tRNAPhe X-ray crystallographic structure (52). In addition, RNA loops can be flexible and unstructured, particularly in the middle of the loop and when the loop is as large as that of the anticodon domain. The ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 has a sevenmembered loop typical of anticodon domains, but with four uridines in the middle of the sequence. Significant chemical shift similarities of these four tandem uridines (U33, U34, U35, and U36) made structure determination particularly challenging. However, 15N-labeling and reiterative modeling allowed us to distinguish the uridines spin systems. A total of 69 NOE-derived distance and 16 backbone torsion angle

of the terminal bases (Table 2). In addition, a total of 52 dihedral angle restraints were used for structural calculations. From the DQF-COSY and 31P spectra, 46 dihedral angle restraints defining the backbone and sugar pucker were incorporated. The torsion angles between U33 and U34 were left unrestrained to not bias the possibility of a tRNAPhe anticodon-like U-turn, though none was observed in the 32Pspectra of either the unmodified or t6A37-containing ASLs. In addition, five through space dihedral angle restraints were placed between the bases of the stem to maintain their planarity ((10°) and an additional restraint was needed on the side chain of t6A37 to keep it planar. The glycosidic angles were left unrestrained since the intranucleotide H1/H6 or H1/H8 NOE is capable of defining their syn/anti conformation. However, the long-range restraints, some of which are illustrated in Figure 4, were more informative and certainly more important in determining the global fold of the molecule. In particular, the distance restraints between the 5 side of the stem and C32 with A38 and the threonine of t6A37 with A38 and U39 of the 3-side of the stem were critical in defining the stem to loop angle of the ASL. The  torsion angles for 14 residues were constrained based on the analysis

restraints defined the loop structure and some of the distance restraints are shown in Figure 5C. NOEs limited the positions of the anticodon nucleosides. NOEs from U34 to A+38 and t6A37 restrained U34 to a position in the loop (Figure 5C). U34 in the unmodified ASLLys3UUU structure also is located in the loop and away from the other anticodon uridines (15), though its position is different from that in the t6A37-modified ASLLys3UUU (Figure 6). In contrast, Gm34 in the purine-rich anticodon of the X-ray crystallographic structure of yeast tRNAPhe is stacked with the subsequent anticodon bases (52). Also in contrast to yeast tRNAPhe, the lack of any far shifted resonances in the phosphorus spectrum suggests that there is no U-turn found in ASLLys3UUU-t6A in solution. The signature cross-peak of a U-turn, the n to n + 2 internucleotide H1 to H8 resonance, was not observed due to overlap in the NOESY spectra. Although we did not eliminate the possibility of a U-turn in the dihedral restraints, no structures with U-turns were generated. In fact, U34 could not have NOEs with A+38 and t6A37 and remain at the bottom of the anticodon loop as in yeast tRNAPhe. DISCUSSION Incorporation of t6A37 into the otherwise unmodified and nonfunctional ASLLys3UUU restored ribosome-mediated, poly-A binding (14, preceding paper in this issue). Because the physicochemical contributions of t6A37 impart function to the ASL, it was important to determine the ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 structure and define the differences in conformation between it and the unmodified ASL. The structures of the unmodified ASLLys3UUU and ASLLys3UUU with 39 in the stem and immediately adjacent to the loop (15) are pertinent to the description of the ASLLys3UUU-t6A37 structure. The presence of pseudouridine demonstrably stabilized the conformation (14, 15). However, we have found that both the unmodified and 39-containing ASLLys3UUU are nonfunctional, i.e., the ASL constructs will not bind poly-A programmed ribosomes (14, preceding paper in this issue). The addition of t6A37 to the 3-side of the loop and adjacent to the anticodon of ASLLys3UUU altered the structure of the molecule in a way that allowed it to bind the ribosome (14,

preceding paper in this issue). Examination of the exchangeable NOESY spectra shows that t6A37 does not change the conformation of the stem. Thus, t6A's physicochemical contribution to a rearrangement of the loop results in the ASL's AAA codon binding activity. In the unmodified ASL,

t6A Inhibits tRNALys3 Anticodon Loop Base Pair there is a potential Watson-Crick base pair between U33 and A37. An upfield, exchangeable, imino proton resonance, assigned to this base pair in the unmodified ASLLys3UUU, was not evident in spectra of the t6A37-modified ASLLys3UUU. Thus, the threonyl modification on t6A37 negates the possibility of this intraloop base pair resulting in an overall lower melting temperature (Table 1). An overall lowering of the melting temperature was observed when t6A37 was incorporated into the anticodon stem and loop of the isoaccepting tRNALys1,2CUU species differing in sequence only by a C34 and an inversion of the stem's C28,G42 base pair (14, preceding paper in this issue). We had predicted these results when we hypothesized that one function of position 37 modifications was to inhibit canonical intraloop base pairs in order to maintain an open anticodon loop (9). The seven-membered anticodon loop could be envisioned as a point of structural dynamics in the tRNA molecule, and a region in which stacking interactions would not be found. However, hydrogen bonding between t6A37 H11 and N1 of the threonyl side chain of t6A37 completes an additional planar ring on adenosine and consequently makes it similar to the guanosine-derived, tricyclic base wybutosine-37 of yeast tRNAPhe. The tricyclic nature of t6A possibly enhances the base stacking ability of the nucleoside. In the solution structure of the ASLLys3UUU, t6A37 and A+38 are coplanar and stacked but because the threonyl side chain must be accommodated in the loop, the two bases are offset by an angle of 40.1°. Stacking interactions are very important in stabilizing RNA structures. Calculations of the entropic thermodynamic parameter (S) for the t6A37-modified and unmodified ASLLys3UUU (Table 1), and for the anticodon stem and loop of the isoaccepting tRNALys1,2CUU species (14, preceding paper in this issue), indicate a considerable contribution by t6A37. In all structures of all calculations, t6A37 is stacked on A38, which is in turn stacked on the adjacent U39 in the stem. Thus, modification at position 37 structures the 3-side of the loop with stacking to A38 and the adjacent stem. t6A37 displaces U34 relative to its position in the unmodified ASL. However, U34 in proximity to A+38 and t6A37, this leaves only two residues, U35 and U36 available for hydrogen bonding to a message on the ribosome (Figure 5). With only two of three anticodon bases available for codon pairing, this unconventional anticodon structure is a reasonable explanation for the bacterial and mammalian tRNALysSUU tendency to frame shift, prematurely terminate translation and mis-read Asn codons (10). We postulated that the modified nucleoside distortion of the anticodon loop was a possible structural determinant for the preferential selection of tRNALys3SUU as primer of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in vivo (10). U35 and U36, though not well defined in the structure for lack of NOE restraints to other nucleosides, were displayed outward from the 10 lowest energy structures (Figure 5A). NOEs between the ribose of U35 and the H6 of U36 helped define their positions relative to each other. Their placement is consistent with that found in the X-ray crystallographic structure of lysyl-tRNA synthetase with cognate tRNALys wherein a phenylalanine intercalates between U35 and U36 (53). At the pH 5.6, A+38 is protonated and charged in the unmodified ASLLys3UUU (15). Incorporation of t6A37 does not alter the protonation of A+38. However, the negative charge contributed by the dissociated carboxylic acid of threonine

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 44, 2000 13403 would neutralize the positive charge of A+38. While the H1 proton of A+38 is not directly observable, protonation of the N1 of the nucleobase is evident from the chemical shift change in H2 (15, 54). An even clearer indicator of adenosine protonation is the upfield shift of the C2 resonance (54). As A38 became protonated with the lowering of the pH, its C2 resonance shifted upfield (see Supporting Information). Formation of an intraloop base pair between C32 and A+38 and adjacent to the stem, could be responsible for stabilizing the RNA at low pH (Table 1) (15). Introduction of t6A37 altered the C32,A+38 base-pairing geometry found in the unmodified ASLLys3UUU (15). The threonyl group occupies the same space as U34 of the unmodified ASLLys3UUU (Figure 6). To adapt to the t6A modification, U34 is displaced away from t6A37 and C32 is moved to accommodate U34 (Figure 6). Displacement of U34 by t6A37 distorts the C32,A+38 base pair by shifting C32 out of alignment with A+38. The through space hydrogen bonding angles, A38-N1-H1 to C32-O2 and A38-N6-H6.1 to C32-N3 are 163° and 168°, respectively, for the unmodified ASLLys3UUU. When t6A37 is added, the hydrogen bonding angles decrease to 143° and 155°, an average of a 17° difference from the unmodified structure and 31° from being linear. It should be noted that this geometry of structure arises from an analysis of the average structure, and that no hydrogen-bonding constraints involving A38 were introduced in the calculations. When C32,A+38 was constrained to be hydrogen-bonded and repeated with the same restrain set, no new violations arose during the distance geometry phase of the modeling and after refinement there was little difference in energy distribution among the structures (data not shown). Most significant to biological function, t6A37 eliminates the canonical intraloop U33,A37 hydrogen bond, displaces U34 and facilitates 3-stacking of the loop. Because t6A37 negates base pair formation in the ASLLys3UUU loop no additional rearrangement of the bases need occur to accommodate the modifications of U34, mcm5s2U34, and the ms2-derivative of t6A37 (Figures 5 and 6). From these results and those of the preceding paper in this issue (14), we conclude that an open, structured loop is required for ribosomal binding. Ribosome binding cannot simply be an induced fit of the ASL, otherwise the unmodified ASLLys3UUU would bind as well as the unmodified ASLLys1,2CUU (14, preceding paper in this issue). This not being the case, anticodon stem and loop domains are distinctive for unambiguous recognition of the tRNA by cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and for recognition of individual codons on the ribosome, yet share a similar architecture for ribosome binding. Modified nucleoside chemistry and structure impart just such a duality to ASLLys3UUU and probably function similarly for other tRNAs. ACKNOWLEDGMENT A special thanks to Robert J.
