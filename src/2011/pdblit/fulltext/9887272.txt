Abstract Two permuted variants of S6 ribosomal protein were obtained in direct and fusion expression systems, respectively. The product of direct expression contained the extra N-terminal methionine residue. The structural properties and conformational stability of these permuteins were compared using 1-D 1 H-NMR, circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, differential scanning calorimetry and resistance to urea-induced unfolding. A pronounced difference in all the parameters studied has been demonstrated. This means that the structure of recombinant protein can be sensitive to peculiarities of the expression and purification procedures, leading particularly to the presence or absence of the Met at the first position in the target protein sequence. ß 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

the expression of a foreign gene in a heterologous cell. Though the large variety of expression systems dealing with di¡erent cells and organisms has been elaborated, the most frequently used approach is the expression of a target gene in Escherichia coli [1]. In addition to the great number of obvious advantages of this system, it has some important drawbacks, including the propensity of foreign protein to form inclusion bodies during intracellular expression [2], and rapid degradation of foreign proteins in the new host if they are not protected from intracellular proteases [3]. It is a widespread belief that these problems can be solved if the target protein is syn-

thesized not from its own N-terminus, but as a fusion protein (i.e. as a hybrid with another protein attached to the amino-terminus) [3]. The other attractive feature of this method is that the fusion protein can be more easily puri¢ed [3]. In the present paper, we attempt to answer the question whether the di¡erence in the expression system and in the puri¢cation procedure can a¡ect the structural properties and conformational stability of recombinant protein. To this end, the gene coding the permuted amino acid sequence of ribosomal protein S6 from Thermus thermophilus was cloned into two di¡erent vectors (ensuring direct and fusion expression) and expressed in E. coli. The structural properties and conformational stability of the obtained products were compared by several physicochemical methods. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Protein expression and isolation The gene of wild-type S6 protein was cloned into expression vector pGEMEX-1 (Promega), while coding the permuted S6 protein was cloned into the same vector and also into vector pMAL-c (New England Biolabs). Both these vectors was expressed in E. coli. Wild-type and permuted proteins were isolated as described elsewhere [4]. As it has been reported earlier [4,5], we have constructed the gene coding the circularly permuted amino acid sequence of T. thermophilus ribosomal protein S6. The goal of such permutation was to obtain the protein with an unusual KLLKLL fold which was suspected of being the target topology for the de novo protein albebetin [6,7]. The following changes were induced in wtS6 in order to have cpS6 protein: (1) ¢rst four C-terminal residues were removed together with its N-terminal Met and Arg; (2) the polypeptide chain was cut between Asn-13 and Leu-14; and (3) the old termini were linked through an AlaSer-Thr-Thr-Pro-Gly loop. To have large quantities of proteins, the gene of wild-type S6 protein was cloned into expression vector pGEMEX-1 (Promega), whereas the gene coding the cpS6 sequence was cloned into the two di¡erent vectors, pMAL-c and pGEMEX-1. The ¢rst vector

expresses the target product as a fusion with the maltose-binding protein which can be then split o¡. The second vector expresses cpS6 directly from the T7 phage promoter (in this case, an additional ATG codon corresponding to the N-terminus Met residue was included into the gene). Nucleotide sequences of the genes were con¢rmed by DNA sequencing. The genes were expressed in E. coli. As the result, two forms of the permuted protein cpS6f and cpS6d (here symbols f and d correspond to the fusion and direct expression) were obtained. A detailed description of the design, genetic, cloning and expression procedures as well as the process of protein puri¢cation were presented in our previous papers [4,5]. HPLC and PAGE were used to analyze the protein purity, which was no less than 95% according to these methods. N-terminal sequence analysis has shown that cpS6d protein contained the extra methionine residue at the ¢rst position, while the cpS6f variant began from Leu. 2.2. Circular dichroism studies Circular dichroism studies were carried out using Jasco-600 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with a temperature-controlled holder. The protein concentration for near and far UV CD measurements was 0.8 mg/ml. The cell pathlength was 0.19 and 10 mm for far and near UV CD measurements, respectively. 2.3. Microcalorimetry measurements Calorimetric measurements were done with a new precise di¡erential adiabatic scanning microcalorimeter SCAL-1 (Scal, Pushchino, Russia), equipped with a newly designed calorimetric unit with cylindrical glass cells (0.34 ml) providing high chemical resistance and excellent dynamic characteristics. The protein concentration for microcalorimetric measurements was 2.1 mg/ml; the scanning rate was 0.9 K/ min. The van 't Ho¡ and calorimetric enthalpies of melting were calculated as described in [8,9]. 2.4. 1 H-NMR measurements H-NMR spectra were recorded at 30³C in a 50 mM aqueous solution of ammonium citrate, pH

Fluorescence measurements Fluorescence measurements were carried out using the Aminco (SPF-1000cs) corrected spectro£uorimeter (American Instrument, Silver Spring, MD, USA) equipped with a temperature-controlled holder. Fluorescence was excited at 290 nm. Protein concentration was 0.01 mg/ml. Cell pathlength was 10.0 mm. Measurements were carried out at 25³C. 2.6. Urea-induced unfolding Urea-induced unfolding of permuted protein was studied by the characteristic red shift of the tryptophan £uorescence spectrum maximum [10]. The unfolding curve was analyzed in accordance with type I analysis [11,12], or type II analysis [13^15]. Type I analysis was done assuming an all-or-none mechanism of the transition between the initial (native) and ¢nal (unfolded) states. In this case it is possible to estimate the free energy of the initial state relative to that of the unfolded one, vGfold , under the given conditions as in [11]: vG fold  3RT ln K eq 1 where Keq is the equilibrium constant of the transition. The value of vGfold within the transition region, where it can be measured, varies linearly with the denaturant concentration [12]: vG fold  vG H2 O  m denaturantX fold 2

where at is the denaturant activity at midpoint, and 3 is the fraction of molecules in the unfolded state. 3. Results It was already noted that there is a di¡erence in the cpS6d and cpS6f amino acid sequences, namely cpS6d has an extra Met residue at the ¢rst position (see Section 2). The presence of zero formyl-methio-

The parameter m re£ects the dependence of the free energy on the denaturant concentration, [denaturant]; whereas the values of vGfold are usually extrapolated linearly to determine its value in the abH2 O sence of denaturant, vGfold . In type II analysis the value of vXeff (which is the di¡erence in the number of denaturant molecules `bound' to one protein molecule in its two states) is determined from the unfolded curve by equation [13] vveff  4at  D3 a  at Da 3

nine is a common feature of a recombinant protein expressed in E. coli [16]. In the case of cpS6f, this methionine is split o¡ together with the maltosebinding protein. On the other hand, the attached maltose-binding protein can a¡ect the in vivo folding and the structure of cpS6f. The structural perturbations in the target protein can be retained after the digestion of maltose-binding protein. Both these factors may obviously lead to the appearance of the structural divergence between the studied proteins. Data presented below were addressed to answer the questions: Is there any di¡erence between cpS6d and cpS6f structural properties and conformational stability? And if so, why do the products of di¡erent expression systems behave di¡erently? 3.1. Near UV CD spectra A rigid asymmetric environment of aromatic amino acid residues gives rise to a pronounced CD spectrum in the near UV region [17]. The studied proteins had almost identical aromatic amino acid content (Trp-1/1 (wtS6/cpS6), Tyr-5/5 (wtS6/cpS6) and Phe2/1 (wtS6/cpS6), sole Phe-97 was substituted by Gly during mutagenesis. Fig. 1A represents the near UV CD spectra of two permuted variants (cpS6f and cpS6d) and wtS6 protein. The spectrum of protein completely unfolded by 8 M GdmCl is also shown for comparison. All three proteins are characterized by intense spectra, re£ecting the fact that they have a rigid tertiary structure. However, Fig. 1 clearly shows that there is a remarkable di¡erence between cpS6f and cpS6d. It can be seen that spectra of permutein from the direct expression system and wild-type protein are close in their intensities. Some discrepancy between the long-wave parts of the spectra can be attributed to the appearance of a permutation-induced di¡erence in the Trp environment. On the other hand, the cpS6f spectrum has a shape similar to that of cpS6d, while its intensity is about 1.35-times lower. This suggests that the structure of permutein from the fusion expression system is somewhat disturbed as compared with that of cpS6d and wtS6. 3.2. Far UV CD spectra Fig. 1B shows the far UV CD spectra of the proteins and gives an additional con¢rmation of the

above suggestion. It is seen that the spectra of cpS6d and wtS6 coincide almost completely, assuming the identity of the secondary structure content in these two proteins. Analysis of the cpS6f far UV CD spectrum shows that the secondary structure of this protein is slightly more disordered than that of the wild-type protein and S6 from the direct expression system. This conclusion follows from the pronounced shift of the intersection point to a shorter wavelength, an overall decrease of spectrum intensity and the increase of [a]208 /[a]222 ratio (the value of this parameter is 1.07, 1.04 and 1.16 for the wildtype, cpS6d and cpS6f, respectively) [17]. 3.3. Tryptophan £uorescence spectra The position and intensity of the tryptophan £uorescence spectrum is sensitive to the surroundings of this chromophore group [18]. For example, it has been established that the £uorescence spectrum of the solvated tryptophan residue has a maximal value in the vicinity of 350 nm, whereas its embedding into

the non-polar environment leads to the characteristic blue shift of the maximum position [7,19^21]. This observation is commonly used for investigation of structural transformations of a protein molecule. Fig. 2 represents the Trp £uorescence spectrum of wild-type S6 protein as well as that of its two permuted forms. The spectrum of the completely unfolded by 8 M GdmCl S6 protein is also shown for comparison. It is seen that the £uorescence spectrum of wild-type S6 protein is relatively red shifted (Vmax = 345 nm). This observation is consistent with

the assumption that Trp residues of the protein are relatively exposed to solvent. Nevertheless, the unfolding of S6 protein is accompanied by a pronounced long-wave shift of the £uorescence spectrum maximum (from 345 to 355 nm) and by about a 3-fold decrease in £uorescence intensity. Fig. 2 clearly shows that the spectra of cpS6d and wtS6 concur, re£ecting the fact that the Trp residues of these two proteins have very similar environments. It should be emphasized that the £uorescence behavior of cpS6f is quite di¡erent from that of wtS6 and

cpS6d: the spectrum is characterized by a visible shift of maximum towards a longer wavelength (V348 nm) and by an approximately 1.3-fold intensity decrease. Both these facts verify the existence of some perturbations in the microenvironment of the Trp residues in S6 permutein from the fusion expression system and show their increased accessibility to the solvent. 3.4. 1 H-NMR spectroscopy data The 1 H-NMR spectra of wild-type S6 protein and its two permuted forms exhibited a number of speci¢c features of native globular proteins. Particularly, the dispersion of chemical shifts for the amide and CK-protons points in favor of a pronounced secondary structure in all three proteins. The methyl regions of the 1 H-NMR spectra of these proteins are presented in Fig. 3. Analysis of these spectra suggests that the values of the chemical shifts for methyl groups and their dispersion in all the forms of S6 protein are characteristic of proteins with a globular tertiary structure, where the aromatic residues and methyl groups are close to each other. On the other hand, the increased half-width of the signals from the

polypeptide backbone protons (e.g. from CK-protons) may result from the increased £exibility of the tertiary structure in the millisecond range, or from protein association. Finally, Fig. 3 shows that all three proteins are characterized by di¡erent spectra. This is a very important ¢nding as it allows conclude that the structures of cpS6d and cpS6f are di¡erent.

3.5. DSC data E¡ect of temperature on wtS6, cpS6d and cpS6f structures was studied by means of di¡erential scanning calorimetry, a method which is one of the most powerful approaches in protein stability investigations [5,6,22]. Fig. 4 collects the temperature dependencies of excess heat capacity (calorimetric curves) measured for all three proteins. The considerable difference in the calorimetric behavior of these proteins can be seen. Indeed, wtS6 is characterized by an extremely high resistance to the temperature (Tm = 372 K) which is expected for protein from thermophilic organisms. On the other hand, Fig. 4 shows that permutation causes considerable destabilization of the protein molecule (Tm = 347 and 342 K for cpS6d and cpS6f, respectively). Interestingly, calorimetric analysis con¢rmed the considerable e¡ect of the expression method on the protein structure, cpS6f was shown to be less stable than cpS6d. 3.6. Urea-induced unfolding Studies of protein stability to the urea- or GdmClinduced unfolding are frequently used to characterize natural, mutated and arti¢cial proteins. Such analysis yields important information on the conformational stability of a protein in the absence of denaturant, vG H2 O (see above). fold We analyzed the unfolding behavior of S6 protein and its permuted variants from the urea-induced changes in the Trp £uorescence spectra. It follows from Fig. 2 that the unfolding of any of the proteins studied is accompanied by the pronounced change of the £uorescence spectrum. The unfolding curves were obtained as the dependence of parameter A value

(A = I370 /I320 , where I370 and I320 correspond to the intensity values at 370 and 320 nm, respectively) on the urea concentration, which is sensitive to changes in position and shape of the £uorescence spectrum [23]. The main advantage of this approach is that we could decrease considerably the protein concentration (from V2.0 mg/ml used for DSC measurements up to 0.01 mg/ml), thus avoiding uncertainties connected with protein association. Fig. 5A depicts the normalized urea-unfolding curves for wtS6, cpS6d and cpS6f proteins. It is necessary to underline that the unfolding data perfectly ¢tted within the frame of the two-state model for all three proteins. This allowed us to perform the usual analysis suggested by Tanford [11] and developed by Pace [12] (see Section 2). Results of such analysis for S6 proteins are presented in Fig. 5B (as vGfold versus [urea] dependencies) and in Table 1. Fig. 5B shows that the data points for all three proteins ¢tted well by straight lines, re£ecting the validity of the all-or-none approximation for the description of unfolding of these proteins. It was established that typical value of m is about 1 kcal/(mol M) for urea-induced unfolding of native natural proteins, whereas that of vG H2 O is fold between 5 and 10 kcal/mol [24]. As follows from Table 1, wtS6, cpS6d and cpS6f are extremely stable to urea-induced unfolding ([urea]1a2 s 4.5 M, H2 O vGfold s 5 kcal/mol and m s 1 kcal/(mol M). Additional con¢rmation of this suggestion was obtained by type II analysis of the unfolding data. It has been shown that the steepness of urea- or guanidinium chloride-induced unfolding curve depends strongly on whether a given protein has a unique tertiary structure (i.e. it is native) or it is already denatured and exists as a molten globule [14,15].

To this end, the corresponding value of the di¡erence in the number of denaturant molecules `bound' to one protein molecule in its two states, vXeff (see Section 2), should be determined. Then this quantity eff should be compared with vXeff N3U and vXMG3U values corresponding to the native-coil and molten globule-coil transitions in globular protein of a given molecular mass. These two parameters can be estimated from [15]: logvXeff  0X97 log M30X07Y N3U logvXeff MG3U  0X89 log M30X4Y 4 5

where M is the protein molecular mass in kDa. For native-coil and molten globule-coil transitions in natural proteins of 11 kDa (as in S6 protein) these equations give vXeff = 8.9 þ 2.0 and vXeff N3U MG3U = 3.4 þ 2.0, respectively. The value of standard deviation ( þ 2.0) in these cases was determined from the corresponding ¢gures in [15]. The vXeff values calculated for S6 proteins (see Table 1) show that the proteins studied have a rigid native-like tertiary structure and are highly resistant to the denaturant action, as vXeff s 8.9 for all three. On the other hand, the data presented in Fig. 5 and Table 1 are consistent with the conclusion that there is a considerable di¡erence in the unfolding behavior of cpS6d and cpS6f proteins. Table 1 shows that all the unfolding parameters of cpS6f ([urea]1a2 , H2 O m, vGfold and vXeff ) are substantially lower than those of cpS6d. This means that the expression method can a¡ect the conformational stability of recombinant protein. 4. Discussion The main result of the present study is to ascertain that two forms of one protein obtained from an identical gene expressed in two di¡erent vectors are quite di¡erent in their structural properties and conformational stability. Identical puri¢cation procedures without denaturing steps [4] were applied for both products of the gene, coding the permuted S6 ribosomal protein sequence. Both proteins were investigated in the same conditions (including identical bu¡ers). This means that the found divergence in structure and stability of cpS6d and cpS6f proteins

are de¢nitely due to the di¡erence in the expression and puri¢cation methods. The cardinal distinction between the two approaches is that the cpS6f protein was obtained after splitting o¡ the maltose-binding protein from the fusion product of the pMAL-c vector, whereas cpS6d was produced in the direct expression system. Let us try to understand the driving forces for the di¡erence. First of all, one could expect the existence of some e¡ect of the attached maltose-binding protein on the in vivo folding and, as a consequence, on the structure of permuted S6 protein. The cpS6f can retain these structural peculiarities, even after the digestion of maltose-binding protein. However, we have established that the urea-induced unfolding of wild-type protein, as well as that of its two permuted variants is reversible. This means that the e¡ect of maltosebinding protein can be excluded. In other words, the observed di¡erence between cpS6d and cpS6f proteins cannot be explained by the discrepancy between their in vivo folding. Secondly, the expression methods induced a distinction in the N-terminal part of the protein amino acid sequence. The direct expression system requires the inclusion of Met at the ¢rst N-terminal position and that is why we had to introduce this residue into the gene of cpS6d. NH2 terminal sequence analysis has proved the divergence in the N-terminal sequences of both proteins, namely, cpS6d protein contained an extra methionine residue at the ¢rst position, while the cpS6f variant began from Leu. Thus, we assume that the di¡erence in structural properties and conformational stability between cpS6f and cpS6d can be due to the presence or absence of methionine residue at the ¢rst position. The same conclusion was recently drawn for a couple of other proteins [25^32]. In the case of Klactalbumin, the Ca2 binding constant of recombinant protein was shown to be one order of magnitude lower than that of the authentic protein isolated from milk [25]. Recombinant K-lactalbumin possessed a remarkable decrease in conformational stability [25^32]. It was suggested that this was primarily due to excess conformational entropy of the N-terminal Met in the unfolded state, and also due to exposure of hydrophobic surface on unfolding [27]. Destabilizing e¡ect of zero methionine was also shown for recombinant apo-myoglobin [28] and hen egg white lysozyme [29]. Contrary to these

cases, the attachment of methionine appears to stabilize S6 permutein structure. The same behaviour was described for recombinant ribonuclease A [30]. On the other hand, neither structural properties, nor conformational stability of recombinant apolipoprotein AIV [31] and calbinding D9k [32] were a¡ected by the attachment of the extra methionine residue. The fact that there is di¤cult to predict whether protein structure will be stabilized, destabilized or una¡ected by an extra N-terminal methionine shows that there are no general rules in the structural consequence of this modi¢cation, and that details of this e¡ect have not yet been well understood. The data presented in our paper unambiguously show that the structural properties and conformational stability of recombinant protein can depend on the peculiarities of the protein expression and puri¢cation procedure. We assume that the more disturbed the tertiary structure of recombinant protein, the more the e¡ect of expression and puri¢cation. This point should be taken into account especially in the cases when one deals with mutated and arti¢cial proteins.
