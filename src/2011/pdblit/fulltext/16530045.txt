Structures of CSL, Notch and Mastermind proteins: piecing together an active transcription complex
Rhett A Kovall
Notch signaling mediates communication between cells, and is essential for proper cell fate decisions in the developing embryo and the adult organism. Signaling initiates proteolytic release of the receptor Notch from the membrane, whereupon the intracellular portion of Notch (NotchIC) localizes to the nucleus and engages the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL. CSL is required for both repression and activation of Notch target genes, and is the focal point of a transcriptional switch, mediating interactions with transcriptional coregulators. Activation of transcription requires corepressor displacement from CSL by NotchIC and the recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind to the complex. Several recently determined and exciting structures of CSL, NotchIC, and an active transcription complex composed of CSL, NotchIC and Mastermind have revealed new insights into transcriptional regulation in the Notch pathway.

congenital syndromes [4], vascular and cardiac disorders [5], and cancer [6]. Our earliest understanding of Notch signaling comes from seminal studies in the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, which led to the identification of the pathway components and to a basic mechanism of signaling [7]. These studies laid much of the groundwork for understanding Notch signaling in higher eukaryotes, such as mammals, and continue to be a source of novel insights into the pathway [8,9]. The central signaling components of the Notch pathway consist of the receptor Notch, the ligand DSL and the nuclear effector CSL. Both CSL (CBF1/RBP-jk, Su(H), Lag-1) and DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lag-2) are named for the mammalian, D. melanogaster and C. elegans orthologous proteins, respectively. The central components have been highly conserved through evolution; for example, the C. elegans and D. melanogaster CSL orthologs share approximately 55% and 80% sequence identity, respectively, with human CSL. Organisms typically encode multiple Notch receptors and DSL ligands, but encode only one CSL nuclear effector; mammals have four Notch receptors (Notch1­4) and five DSL ligands (Delta 1, 3 and 4, and Jagged 1 and 2). The receptor Notch and the ligand DSL are both multidomain type I transmembrane proteins that contain a single membrane-spanning region, and CSL is a DNA-binding transcription factor that is required for both repression and activation of Notch target genes. Despite the prominent role that Notch signaling plays in biology, only a handful of Notch target genes have been identified in mammals, such as the HES and HERP families [10], cyclin D1 [11], interleukin-6 [12], CD23 [13] and myc [14,15]. Notch signaling occurs when the ligand DSL on one cell interacts with the receptor Notch on a neighboring cell [1]. This interaction triggers two proteolytic cleavages of Notch: the first cleavage, which is extracellular, results from the action of a membrane-bound metalloprotease termed TACE (TNFa-converting enzyme) in mammals; the second cleavage, which is intramembranous, results from the action of the g-secretase membrane protein complex and releases the intracellular portion of Notch (NotchIC) from the membrane. Subsequently, NotchIC localizes to the nucleus, where it engages CSL, converting it from a transcriptional repressor to an activator. Interestingly, second messengers do not amplify the Notch signal and, therefore, the signal strength is dependent upon nuclear concentrations of NotchIC. This elegantly simple mechanism is known

Introduction
The Notch pathway is a conserved metazoan signaling mechanism, in which extracellular receptor­ligand interactions are transduced into changes in gene expression via the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL (reviewed in [1]). Notch signaling occurs between neighboring cells, and is one of the primary pathways by which organisms differentiate precursor cells into specialized tissues and organs. Notch is indispensable during embryonic development and is also essential for cell fate decisions in the adult organism (e.g. during hematopoiesis) [2]. Additionally, Notch has important roles in cellular proliferation and apoptosis, establishment of the stem cell niche, and stem cell renewal [3]. Misregulated Notch signaling underlies the pathogenesis of certain

as canonical Notch signaling, for which there are several excellent reviews [1,16,17]. Pathway complexity arises in part from cross-talk with other signaling pathways [9] and from numerous modulators that act on the ligand, receptor and nuclear effector to produce a diverse scheme of regulation that is dependent on cellular context [1]. There are also non-canonical Notch signaling pathways that are largely CSL independent; these are reviewed elsewhere [18]. CSL is the conduit for converting extracellular and cytoplasmic Notch signals into transcriptional outputs. In the absence of a Notch signal, CSL represses transcription of Notch target genes by interacting with the basal transcription machinery [19] and recruiting ubiquitous corepressor proteins to form multiprotein transcriptional repressor complexes [20] (Figure 1a). Specifically, among the corepressors that have been shown to interact with CSL are SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors)/N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) [21], CIR (CBF1-interacting corepressor) [22], Hairless [23] and SPEN (also known as SHARP, SMRT/HDAC-1associated protein) [24]. The binding of corepressors by CSL recruits histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs) to the site, which convert the local chromatin into a transcriptionally silent form; however, this process is poorly understood at the molecular level for Notch target genes. In the presence of a Notch signal, NotchIC binding to CSL displaces corepressors from CSL (Figure 1a). The transcriptional coregulator SKIP (Ski-interacting protein), which is involved in transcription complexes from multiple pathways, bridges interactions between CSL and either NotchIC or corepressors, but not both simultaneously, and is thought to be present during both transcriptional activation and repression [25]. Interestingly, the Epstein­Barr virus protein EBNA2 (Epstein­Barr virus nuclear antigen 2) is thought to mimic NotchIC by displacing corepressors from CSL and interacting with SKIP [26]. Other viral proteins, such as RTA from Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus, also interact with CSL to co-opt Notch signaling for the benefit of the viral life cycle [27]. After corepressor displacement by NotchIC, the transcriptional coactivator protein Mastermind binds, forming a ternary complex with CSL and NotchIC (Figure 1a). Activation of transcription occurs by recruitment of the general transcription factors PCAF/GCN5 and CBP/p300 to the CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex [28­ 30] (Figure 1a); however, the level of transcriptional activation is dependent on the promoter and cell type, as well as on which NotchIC paralog engages CSL [31]. Transcriptional activation is halted by proteolytic turnover of NotchIC, in which Mastermind and SKIP recruit specific kinases that hyperphosphorylate NotchIC, resulting in ubiquitin-ligase-mediated degradation [32] (Figure 1a). Thus, CSL is the centerpiece of a transcriptional switch, functioning as a hub for protein­protein interactions with transcriptional coregulators. The switch

from repression to activation is thrown by the displacement of corepressors from CSL by NotchIC and the formation of the CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex. Although much progress has been made using genetic, cellular and biochemical techniques to identify Notch pathway components and CSL-binding partners, the structural biology of these factors was largely unknown until recently. Accumulated data have led to the proposed displacement mechanism of transcriptional regulation in the Notch pathway, in which NotchIC displaces corepressors from CSL [1,17]; however, the molecular details that underlie such a mechanism are, at best, poorly understood. One of the challenging questions in the field is how do limiting concentrations of NotchIC compete with abundant corepressors of CSL to convert CSL from a repressor to an activator? Several recent landmark papers describing the crystal structures of CSL [33], Notch [34­ 36] and CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complexes [37,38] have provided a wealth of structural data and impacted our molecular understanding of transcriptional regulation in the Notch pathway.

Structure of DNA-bound CSL
The first detailed view of the transcription factor CSL was provided by the determination of the structure of the C. elegans CSL ortholog, Lag-1, bound to cognate DNA [33] (Figure 2). Before the structure was determined, it had been hypothesized, based on primary sequence analysis, that CSL would have Rel homology region (RHR) domains similar to those of the Rel family transcription factors NF-kB and NFAT [39]; however, the architecture of CSL proved to be unexpectedly unique in the arrangement of these domains. The structure revealed that CSL is composed of three integrated domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the b-trefoil domain (BTD) and the Cterminal domain (CTD) (Figures 1b and 2). The NTD and CTD share structural similarities with the RHR family of transcription factors. The NTD of CSL interacts with the major groove of DNA in a similar manner to Rel proteins; however, in stark contrast to Rel family members, the BTD contributes to minor groove DNA binding in a novel manner and the CTD does not interact with the DNA at all. The contribution of NTD and BTD sidechain interactions with DNA provided a structural rationalization of the DNA site specificity observed for CSL [40,41]. The CSL­DNA complex structure determination further revealed that the BTD of CSL has an atypical b-trefoil fold, missing two of the prototypical twelve b strands that normally constitute this domain; this results in a large exposed hydrophobic surface with a distinctive pocket on the BTD [33]. Interestingly, previous biochemical and cellular studies demonstrated that both NotchIC and corepressors interact with CSL primarily through a central region of the protein that corresponds to the BTD of CSL [33,42]. These data, taken together,

suggested a prominent role for the BTD in mediating the interactions of transcriptional coregulators with CSL.

Structure of NotchIC
The intracellular domains of all Notch orthologs (NotchIC) consist of at least three absolutely conserved domains: the membrane-proximal RAM (RBP-jk-associated molecule) domain, followed by seven consecutive ankyrin repeats (the ANK domain) and a C-terminal PEST sequence (Figure 1b). In vitro, NotchIC interacts strongly with CSL through its RAM domain [43], but only weakly through its ankyrin repeats [44]. However, the ankyrin repeats are required for the formation of the CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex and transcriptional activation [39,45]. The CSL­RAM domain interaction is necessary for signaling in vivo; however, overexpression of only the NotchIC ankyrin repeats can eliminate the requirement for RAM under non-physiological conditions [46­48]. Similarly, the CSL­NotchIC­ Mastermind ternary complex can be formed in vitro in the absence of RAM, but requires 300-fold greater amounts of NotchIC ANK [39]. The PEST sequence, which is located near the C terminus and is enriched in proline, glutamate, serine and threonine residues, is involved in negative regulation of the pathway. Phosphorylation of PEST targets NotchIC for proteolytic degradation via E3 ligase recognition and ubiquitination [32]. Recently, three other functional regions in NotchIC have been identified, termed PPD (potential phosphorylated
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2007, 17:117­127

domain), DTS (downregulation targeting sequence) and S4 (for WSSSSP) (Figure 1b). PPD is located between the ankyrin repeats and PEST, and was shown to enhance the binding of NotchIC to CSL in D. melanogaster [49]. DTS is located between the RAM and ANK domains of NotchIC, and is important for endocytic trafficking of Notch and downregulation of signaling [50]. S4 is located near the C terminus and is phosphorylated similarly to PEST, resulting in degradation of NotchIC [51]; however, S4 is phosphorylated by a different kinase to PEST and probably represents yet another pathway to negatively regulate Notch signaling. Although PEST, PPD, DTS and S4 are clearly important for NotchIC function, these regions are probably unstructured in the absence of a binding partner and have not been resolved in any of the recent crystal structures of NotchIC. The Notch RAM domain is also unstructured in the absence of CSL [39]; however, the structure of RAM has been resolved in the context of the CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex [37] and will be discussed in subsequent sections. Several structures of the ankyrin repeat region of NotchIC have been determined, including orthologs from mammals [34,35,38], D. melanogaster [36] and C. elegans [37] (Figure 3). The ankyrin repeat fold is a common protein­protein interaction motif and is composed of multiple repeats that form an elongated molecule [52]. Each repeat contains two a helices connected by a turn and a b-hairpin motif. The NotchIC ANK domain was originally identified as having only six ankyrin repeats

using primary sequence analysis, but later experiments predicted NotchIC ANK to contain seven ankyrin repeats based on cooperative unfolding experiments [53]. The first crystal structure of ANK came from D. melanogaster (PDB code 1OT8) and resolved the domain boundaries of ANK [36]; this prompted the reexamination of previous mutagenesis and deletion studies on NotchIC [54]. The structure of D. melanogaster ANK in isolation, as well as of human Notch1 ANK (PDB codes 1YYH and 2F8Y), showed ordered structure for only repeats 2­7, with the first repeat disordered in these structures [35,36,38]; however, in the context of the CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex, repeat 1 becomes ordered (PDB codes 2F8X and 2FO1) [37,38]. Additionally, the C. elegans CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex structure revealed an unanticipated N-terminal cap structure in NotchIC directly preceding the first ankyrin repeat (PDB code 2FO1) [37] (Figure 3a). The Nterminal cap loosely resembles an ankyrin repeat, but does not strictly conform to the canonical ankyrin repeat

structural motif. Primary sequence analysis and secondary structure prediction of NotchIC from other organisms suggests that the N-terminal cap structure is conserved, albeit not to the same extent as repeats 1­7. The function of the N-terminal cap is unclear, as it does not contribute to the overall stability of isolated ANK ([55]; D Barrick, personal communication), and neither contacts Mastermind nor interacts appreciably with CSL in the CSL­ NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex structure [37]. Conceivably, the N-terminal cap of ANK may be important for stabilizing the fold of the first ankyrin repeat in the context of the ternary complex or for creating an interaction surface for transcriptional binding partners.

to DNA were determined for C. elegans [37] and human [38] orthologous proteins (Figure 4). The overall topologies of the ternary complexes are remarkably similar, emphasizing the conservation of fold and function throughout evolution. That CSL is the focal point of the transcriptional switch is also illustrated in these structures, as CSL simultaneously mediates interactions with NotchIC, Mastermind and DNA. The structures show that Mastermind adopts a strikingly bent helical

conformation, with its N-terminal helical region forming a tripartite complex with ankyrin repeats 3­7 of NotchIC and the CTD of CSL, while the C-terminal helix of Mastermind interacts with the NTD of CSL (Figure 4). With the exception of the first ankyrin repeat becoming structurally ordered in the ternary complex, the overall structure of NotchIC ANK is unchanged upon complex formation. In the CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex, the interactions of CSL with DNA and

the overall conformation of DNA are maintained in both ternary complexes compared to the isolated structure of CSL bound to DNA, suggesting that, in general, DNA binding is not affected by ternary complex formation. However, changes in DNA affinity cannot be completely ruled out because of the limitations of the diffraction data from both ternary complexes, and the absence of quantitative DNA-binding data for CSL proteins in isolation and in the context of the ternary complex. Although the overall architectures of the human and worm CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex structures have a high degree of correspondence, upon closer examination there are differences between the ternary complexes that can be summarized as follows: differences in the NotchIC constructs used for crystallization; differences in the conformation of CSL; and differences in the molecular interactions of conserved residues at domain interfaces. Moreover, these differences are important to consider, because they led the authors to different conclusions and might potentially impact models of transcriptional regulation by CSL [37,38]. The most obvious difference between the two ternary complex structures stems from the inclusion of additional domains of NotchIC in the worm complex that were not included in the structure determination of the human CSL­ NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex. These include the RAM domain and the N-terminal capping ankyrin repeat of NotchIC. Although both these elements are conserved, the functional significance of the N-terminal capping ankyrin repeat, as described above, is unclear. The interaction of RAM with CSL and its implications for function are described below. The RAM domain of NotchIC binds the BTD of CSL in an extended conformation that tracks along the conserved hydrophobic surface identified in the structure of CSL bound to DNA [33,37] (Figure 5a). Only the first 25 Nterminal residues of RAM contact the BTD of CSL, with the remaining 69 intervening residues between RAM and ANK disordered in the crystal and presumably unstructured. The RAM domain is anchored to the BTD through the interaction of its highly conserved FWFP (F for hydrophobic residue) motif with the BTD, which directs the conserved tryptophan and proline into the hydrophobic pocket (Figure 5a). A large loop in BTD also interacts with RAM, forming a compact antiparallel b sheet with RAM upstream of the FWFP motif. Even in the absence of RAM, the BTD loop assumes a similar conformation in the human CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex structure [38] (Figure 5a). Recent thermodynamic studies of the RAM­BTD interaction confirm what is observed in the crystal structure and demonstrate that RAM binds to BTD with moderately high affinity (200 nM Kd) [56]. Interestingly, CSL mutations within this BTD loop not only affect RAM interactions with BTD, but also affect the interactions of corepressors
www.sciencedirect.com

with CSL, resulting in decreased levels of repression [42]. Although the BTD loop is in a much more extended conformation in the CSL­DNA structure [33] (Figure 5a), this open conformation is due in a large part to crystal contacts and, therefore, conformational changes attributed solely to RAM binding are unclear. Nevertheless, previous cellular and genetic studies, and current structural studies of the BTD loop suggest a very important role for this structural element in the CSL transcriptional switch. Another striking difference between the worm and human CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex structures is the substantial interdomain conformational changes that are observed within CSL from the worm ternary complex structure [37], but that are not seen in the human ternary complex structure [38] (Figure 6). A comparison of the worm CSL structures in isolation and in the context of the ternary complex reveals a large interdomain conformational change, in which the dispositions of BTD and CTD change with respect to NTD (Figure 6a). In stark contrast, the structure of human CSL from the CSL­NotchIC­Mastermind ternary complex more closely corresponds to that of worm CSL in the unbound state (Figure 6b,c). Aligning the structures in LSQMAN [57] reveals that human CSL overlays noticeably better with worm CSL in the unbound state (379 Ca ° atoms overlaid with a 1.35 A RMSD) than the two worm ° CSL structures (339 Ca atoms overlaid with a 1.65 A RMSD); this difference is substantial considering that the most sequence divergence between CSL orthologs occurs between human and worm proteins. One consequence of these conformational changes is that the architecture of the worm ternary complex structure is more compact with respect to the human structure and buries significantly greater surface area within the complex. Using Areaimol [58] to compare the buried surface area for the worm and human ternary complexes reveals that ° ° the CTD­ANK interaction buries 2344 A2 and 1803 A2 for the worm and human proteins, respectively. Moreover, the binding of Mastermind to the complex buries ° ° 4567 A2 and 3396 A2 for the worm and human proteins, respectively. These differences are also observed at the molecular level, as the sidechain interactions of conserved residues at domain interfaces are disparate between worm and human complex structures (Figure 5b,c). These structural comparisons raise the question of what is the underlying basis of the observed conformational differences between the CSL structures and what role, if any, do these conformational changes play in the displacement mechanism of transcriptional regulation in the Notch pathway? In the absence of any additional CSL structures from mammals, worms or other organisms, differences in crystallization conditions, crystal packing forces, and inherent disparities between worm and human CSL proteins cannot be formally ruled out as the basis of

the observed disparities. An intriguing possibility, however, is that the conformations of the two ternary complex structures represent different substates capable of signaling and that inclusion of RAM makes NotchIC a more effective competitor for CSL when nuclear NotchIC concentrations are limiting.

transcriptional switch. Moreover, the field has benefited from simultaneous crystal structures of CSL­NotchIC­ Mastermind ternary complexes from organisms as divergent as worms and humans. However, our molecular understanding of CSL-mediated transcriptional regulation in the Notch pathway is far from complete and several important structural questions remain: how do corepressors interact with CSL; are there common or distinct modes for the binding of unrelated corepressors to CSL; how does CSL interact with the basal transcription machinery; how do viral proteins such as EBNA2, RTA and LANA interact with CSL; do structural differences between the four mammalian Notch paralogs in the context of the ternary complex underlie their differences in transcription potency? Finally, what are the molecular interactions of CSL with neighboring DNA-binding transcription factors?
