The -I domain, found in the -subunit of the leucocyte integrins such as M2 and L2, switches between the open and closed tertiary conformations, reflecting the high- and low-affinity ligand-binding states of the integrin that are required for regulated cell adhesion and migration. In the present study we show, by using point mutations and engineered disulphide bonds, that ligand affinity can be reduced or increased allosterically by altering the equilibrium between the closed and open states. We determined equilibrium constants for the binding of two ligands, fibrinogen and intercellular cell-adhesion molecule 1, to the M-I domain by surface plasmon resonance, and determined crystal structures of a low-affinity mutant. Locking the domain

in the open conformation increases affinity by a factor of no greater than 10, consistent with a closely balanced equilibrium between the two conformations in the absence of ligand. This behaviour contrasts with that of the unliganded L-I domain, for which the equilibrium lies strongly in favour of the closed conformation. These results suggest significant differences in the way the parent integrins regulate I domain conformation and hence ligand affinity. Key words: A domain, allostery, gain-of-function, I domain, integrin.

INTRODUCTION

Integrins are adhesion receptors that mediate cell adhesion and migration by binding extracellular matrix (or counter-receptors on other cells) via their extracellular heads, and cytoskeletal and signalling molecules via their cytoplasmic tails [1]. They are  heterodimers, consisting of a head domain from which emerges two legs, one from each subunit, ending in a pair of single-pass transmembrane helices and short cytoplasmic tails (Figure 1A). The integrin `head' comprises a seven-bladed propeller from the -subunit that makes an intimate contact with a GTPaselike domain of the -subunit (the -I domain), in a manner that resembles the heterotrimeric G proteins [2]. Nine -subunits (1, 2, 10, 11, D, E, L, M and X) contain an additional domain, the -I domain, that is inserted between two loops on the upper surface of the propeller, where it plays a central role in ligand binding [3­5]. Instead of a catalytic centre, the I domain contains an invariant ligand-binding site called MIDAS, for metalion-dependent adhesion site, in which a metal ion is co-ordinated by three loops from the I domain, and a glutamic or aspartic acid from the ligand completes an octahedral co-ordination sphere around the metal (Figure 1B). In those integrins that lack an -I domain, the -I domain and propeller are major ligand recognition sites [6]; in the -I domain integrins, the -I domain and propeller play regulatory roles. In the absence of ligand, bonds between the legs, tails and head are believed to hold the head in an `inactive' or `resting' conformation that has low affinity for ligand [7­9]. Recent structural data suggest that this conformation is severely bent [10], in contrast to the extended conformation assumed from earlier studies. During `outside-in' signalling, the head binds to extracellular matrix proteins or counter-receptors on other cells, triggering a `switchblade' opening of the integrin head that is

propagated down the `legs' and through the plasma membrane, leading to a re-organization of the C-terminal tails that allows them to bind intracellular proteins [10,11]. During `inside-out' signalling, cytosolic proteins bind and sequester one or both of the cytoplasmic tails, triggering conformational changes in the head that lead to a high-affinity `active' integrin [9,12]. The first -I domain crystal structure, from integrin M2, revealed a compact domain comprising a central mostly parallel -sheet surrounded on both sides by amphipathic -helices [13] (Figure 1B). The invariant MIDAS motif lies at the Cterminal end of the central -sheet, with three loops contributing side chains that co-ordinate the Mg2+ ion. Surface-exposed side chains surrounding the MIDAS motif are variable; they provide additional ligand contact points and hence ligand specificity [3,14­22]. The crystal structure of the 2-I domain, in complex with a triple helical fragment of collagen, provides a model for ligand engagement by all -I domains [23]. A glutamic acid side chain from the ligand completes the co-ordination sphere of the Mg2+ , while further specificity arises from contacts with the surrounding surface. This structure, along with an earlier structure of the M-I domain bound to a `ligand-mimetic' crystal contact [24], demonstrates that ligand binding triggers a profound conformational switch in the -I domain that underlies affinity regulation and signal transduction. Recombinant I domains exist in two distinct conformations, open (high affinity) and closed (low affinity) (Figure 1B). The key difference between these conformations is the rearrangement of the metal-co-ordinating residues at the MIDAS, allowing the ligand glutamate to bind, which is mechanically coupled to a large downward shift of the C-terminal helix at the opposite pole of the domain. The shift of the C-terminal helix is highly significant in the context of the whole integrin, since the helix is packed

against the propeller and -I domain. How does the quaternary organization of the integrin control the conformation of the -I domain, and hence, ligand affinity? To begin to shed light on this issue, we have introduced point mutations and engineered disulphide bonds into the M-I domain to stabilize the open and closed conformations, and determined binding constants for two ligands, intercellular cell-adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and fibrinogen. Our studies show that the equilibrium between the recombinant M and L-I domain conformations is very different, with distinct implications for how the parent integrin regulates ligand affinity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Mutagenesis

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out in a pGEX-2T vector, encoding residues Gly-127  Ile-319 (G127­I319) of the recombinant M-I domain (provided by GlaxoSmithKline, Stockley Park West, Uxbridge, Middlesex, U.K.). Mutations were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.) with the following substitutional mutagenic primers: C128A forward, 5 -GAGGCCCTCCGAGGGGCTCCTCAAGAGGATAGTG-3 ; C128A reverse,

Protein preparation

The wild-type and mutant M-I domains were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli as described previously [3]. The I domain was digested overnight at 4 C with 0.5 % (w/w) immobilized trypsin (Pierce, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.) to remove 16 N-terminal residues that interfere with crystal growth. The free cysteine in wildtype M-I domain was blocked with iodoacetamide after reduction to prevent dimer formation. The C128A/D132C/K315C mutant was incubated with 0.1 mM CuSO4 and 0.1 mM ophenanthroline to promote disulphide bond formation. The presence of free cysteines was determined by titration against DTNB [5,5 -dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)] in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride/20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, using L-cysteine to generate a calibration curve. Wild-type and mutant I domains were assessed for monomer formation by size-exclusion chromatography on a 24-ml-Superdex-75 column HR 10/30 using the AKTA system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.). Recombinant soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM1) containing all five extracellular immunoglobulin domains (D1­ D5) was provided by GlaxoSmithKline and fibrinogen was a gift from Dr R. F. Doolittle (University of California, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.).

All data were analysed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 program, subtracting binding to the blank flow cell and the blank buffer injection to account for any non-specific binding. For each sensorgram, the peak response levels achieved in the steady-state region were plotted against analyte concentration. This plot was fitted to a single-site-binding equation (Langmuir isotherm) to determine dissociation constant (K D ) values (Figure 2).
Crystallographic studies of wild-type, A318C and reduced C128A/D132C/K315C M-I domain mutants

A Biacore 3000 SPR-based biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to measure binding parameters for the interaction between the M-I domain and the ligands, fibrinogen and sICAM-1. All proteins were dialysed extensively against running buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 20, 5 mM MgCl2 , pH 7.5. sICAM-1 and fibrinogen were immobilized, at concentrations ranging from 200 to 1000 response units, onto Pioneer B1 chips (Biacore) via N-ethyl-N (3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/ N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) cross-linking as directed by the manufacturer. A blank flow cell which had been EDC/NHS activated and ethanolamine blocked was used as a reference surface. Steady-state experiments were performed by injecting the I domains over the chip at 5 µl · min-1 for 8 min. The chip surface was regenerated with 1 M NaCl. Typically, sensorgrams

The wild-type and mutant proteins were dialysed into 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 , 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml prior to crystallization. All crystals were grown using the sitting-drop vapour diffusion method. Wild-type crystals were grown using 0.2 M NaCl, 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 0.1 M potassium citrate, pH 4.2, at 23 C. A318C crystals grew using 22%­30% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether 2000, 0.2 M (NH4 )2 SO4 , 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6, at 4 C. Reduced C128A/D132C/K315C crystals grew using 0.2 M NaCl, 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 3000, 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5, at 23 C. All crystals were soaked in reservoir buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in a cryo-stream of nitrogen at 100 K. Data from wild-type and A318C crystals

We first made a series of single and double M-I domain mutants based upon mutations that have been previously reported to increase the affinity of integrin M2 [19,30,31]. These mutations disrupt bonds between the C-terminal helix and the body of the

domain, destabilizing the closed conformation and thus favouring the open, high-affinity conformation (Figure 1B). Except for I316R, which expressed very poorly, the mutants expressed normally and were purified as for wild-type. Binding to sICAM-1 and fibrinogen was monitored by SPR (Figure 3A). All of the mutants showed enhanced binding, but the largest increase was only 4-fold.

We made next a series of cysteine mutants that were designed to lock the conformation of the I domain, by engineering disulphide bridges between the C-terminal helix and the N-terminus. Two of these mutants expressed well and were monodisperse as judged by gel filtration; these were used for further functional and structural studies. The first mutant, A318C (Ala-318 is located at the end of the C-terminal helix), made use of the naturally occurring cysteine, Cys-128 (N-terminal to the first -strand), as the disulphide bonding partner. The disulphide formed spontaneously as judged by lack of reactivity to DTNB, which binds to free cysteine residues. Binding to sICAM-1 and fibrinogen, as measured by SPR, was substantially (5­6-fold) reduced, compared with wild-type (Table 2). Wild-type binding was restored by reduction of the disulphide with the addition of 10 mM DTT (Figure 3B). As a control similar reducing treatment applied to the wild-type I domain had no effect on ligand binding. In order to understand this behaviour we determined the crystal structure of this mutant. Crystals grew in a space group that was different from those previously published [13,24,32], so we also grew wild-type crystals in the same space group. Both mutant and wild-type crystals diffracted X-rays to high resolution, and were closely isomorphous. We determined the structures by molecular replacement (at 1.5 Å and 1.25 Å resolution for the wild-type and mutant, respectively). The structures are very similar with a root-mean-square deviation for all C atoms of 0.72 Å, and represent the closed conformation as previously described [24]. The MIDAS motif is slightly distorted, so that metal does not bind; but this occurs in both wild-type and mutant structures, showing that it is a result of the intermolecular packing in this crystal form. Indeed the MIDAS of the A318C mutant is functional in solution as demonstrated by its ability to bind ligands in a cationdependent manner. In the mutant, the N-terminal strand loops up and around the C-terminal helix to form a disulphide bond (Figure 4). This suggests that the low affinity of this mutant arises from a novel organized structure at the base of the domain, in which the N-terminal arm has wrapped around the C-terminal helix in order to form the disulphide bond, thus restraining the domain in the closed conformation by restricting the downward motion of the C-terminal helix. The second disulphide mutant studied, the triple mutant C128A/D132C/K315C, avoided the flexibility of the residues Nterminal to the -strand which allowed the A318C mutant to adopt the closed conformation. Asp-132 is the first residue of the N-terminal -strand, and its main chain is held rigidly in place by being an integral part of the central -sheet. Lys-315 lies on the C-terminal helix, one turn further upstream from Ala-318 used in the first disulphide mutant (Figure 1D). Cys-128 was mutated to alanine in order to avoid mixed disulphide formation. For this triple mutant, disulphide formation did not occur spontaneously in solution, but incubation in the presence of oxidizing agent (Cu2+ ) allowed disulphide formation to proceed to completion. SPR analysis of the oxidized mutant revealed an approx. 10-fold

increase in affinity for both sICAM-1 and fibrinogen, compared with the wild-type domain (Table 2). Reduction of the disulphide reverted the domain to wild-type behaviour (Figure 3C). Typical cation dependence was observed: ligand binding was significantly reduced with EDTA treatment confirming that binding is mediated by the MIDAS. We were unable to crystallize the triple mutant in its oxidized form, but the reduced form crystallized in the open conformation, with a ligand mimetic, and we determined its structure at 2.5 Å resolution. The structure is very similar to the wild-type open conformation [24], showing that the mutations do not unduly perturb the structure. The C-terminal helix is actually shifted by a further 2 Å `downwards', i.e. in the closed-to-open direction. The ligand mimetic­crystal contact involves residue Glu-314, which is on the C-terminal helix next to one of the introduced cysteines. The two cysteine sulphurs are 6.5 Å apart, and modelling studies suggest that disulphide formation requires only a modest reorganization of the last turn of the C-terminal helix, which could occur readily in solution but would break the crystal contact, rationalizing the lack of growth of this crystal form under oxidizing conditions. This crystal form is, so far, unique in stabilizing the open conformation, so we made a further mutation, E314K, in order to avoid forming this crystal form. However, the oxidized quadruple mutant did not form crystals under any conditions.

126 DISCUSSION

C. J. McCleverty and R. C. Liddington

Our studies show that restraining the motion of the C-terminal helix of the recombinant M-I domain can either increase or decrease the affinity for ligand. The results are consistent for the two ligands studied, fibrinogen and sICAM-1. Restraining the helix into the `open' conformation, by using an engineered disulphide bridge, yields an I domain that has an affinity (K D  500­ 600 nM) very similar to that of the activated parent integrin and that shows normal Mg2+ dependence of binding, suggesting that this conformation resembles the structure in the active integrin with an intact MIDAS motif. Although we were unable to crystallize this mutant in its oxidized form, the reduced mutant crystallized in an open conformation very similar to that observed previously for the wild-type domain. A small reorganization of the last turn of the C-terminal helix, a region that is far from the ligandbinding surface, should be sufficient to create the disulphide. Restraining the helix to adopt the closed conformation, by using a different disulphide bridge, reduced the affinity by a factor of approx. 50-fold compared with the locked open domain. The crystal structure of this low-affinity mutant confirms that a novel disulphide bridge has formed that stabilizes the closed conformation. The bridge links an N-terminal arm to the end of the C-terminal helix. The structure is well ordered in this region (although the atomic B factors are 30­40% higher than the domain average). However, the structure suggests that a downward shift of the helix is still possible, involving a swinging motion of the N-terminal arm. This contrasts with the high-affinity mutant, in which the helix is disulphide-linked to the beginning of a -strand that is held tightly in place as part of the central -sheet. Thus, the affinity of a fully `locked closed' M-I domain is likely to be lower than that observed here. Springer and co-workers [33] recently carried out a similar series of experiments on the L-I domain, and showed that the `locked open' L-I domain also has a ligand affinity comparable to that of the activated parent integrin (approx. 200 nM). They also made a `locked closed' domain in which a disulphide bridge linked rigid elements of the domain; this displayed a ligand affinity of approx. 104 -fold lower than the `locked open'. Given the close structural similarities between the two domains, it is likely that a fully `locked closed' M-I domain would show a similar affinity reduction. A major difference between the results for the L and MI domains lies in the behaviour of the wild-type recombinant domains. In the case of M, the wild-type ligand affinity is only approx. 10-fold less than that of the `locked open' domain. By applying a simple thermodynamic model (Figure 5), the estimated fraction of the open conformation in the absence of ligand is 10­ 12%. This result is consistent with an independent estimate based on initial binding rates of M to iC3b (the proteolytic fragment of the third component of complement) [19]. In the case of the L-I domain, the affinity of the wild-type recombinant domain is identical to that of the `locked closed' domain, suggesting that in solution the equilibrium between the unliganded domains is shifted almost completely ( 104 ) in favour of the closed conformation (Figure 5B). How does the quaternary organization of the integrin regulate the affinity of the -I domain? It is straightforward to build a model of the -I domain integrin head group based on the crystal structure of V3 and M-I domain (Figure 1C). The model predicts that the -I domain will contact both the -subunit propeller and the -I domain. A priori, there are two possibilities of allosteric regulation: the quaternary organization of the inactive (resting) integrin may serve to reduce the inherent affinity of the isolated -I domain by stabilizing its closed tertiary conformation (Model A); or the quaternary organization of the active integrin

(A) The M-I domain. In unliganded (u) state, the equilibrium between the closed (CU ) and open (OU ) states favours the closed state by a small amount. The binding energy (G o = - 8.7 kCal · mol-1 ) for the locked open state was measured directly by experiment on the mutant domain. The binding energy of a fully locked closed domain ( G c ) was not measured, but is assumed to be similar to that of L-I. The binding energy of the wild-type domain is the population-weighted average of the binding of CU and OU , and approximates to E . Assuming that CL contributes negligibly to ligand binding, the observed binding energy for the wild-type domain, G obs = G o - (1 - F )RT lnF , where F is the fraction of molecules in the open conformation in the absence of ligand. The two ligand-binding studies give a consistent value of F = 0.11 + 0.02, similar to that estimated from initial binding rates [19]. (B) The L-I domain. - Estimates of G c and G O were obtained by experiment on disulphide-locked domains [33]. The affinity of the wild-type domain ( E ) was identical to that of the locked closed domain. This implies that the energy of CL is equal to or lower than that of OL , and that the equilibrium between CU and OU lies greatly in favour of CU (F 10 - 4 ).

may serve to stabilize the open conformation of the I domain (Model B). The two models are not mutually exclusive, and there is evidence for both mechanisms. Thus mutagenesis of the lower surfaces of the -I domain has varying effects on integrin affinity. Many mutations (to both L2 and M2) are gain-of-function (Figure 1C), suggesting that these mutations disrupt intersubunit bonds that hold the -I domain in the closed conformation, i.e., Model A [34,35]. However, a few mutations, particularly to the linker region between the C-terminal helix of -I and the propeller, lead to loss of function [35,36]. This region includes a conserved glutamic acid, and Alonso et al. [36] have proposed that the glutamic acid completes the co-ordination sphere of the -I domain MIDAS motif in the active integrin; that is, the active quaternary conformation serves to stabilize the open -I domain (Model B). As noted above, the affinity of recombinant L-I domain is approx. 104 -fold lower than for the locked open domain [33],

which is similar to that of the activated integrin (approx. 200 nM). The behaviour of the recombinant L-I domain contrasts with functional studies on a recombinant soluble L2 integrin containing the complete extracellular head but lacking the transmembrane helices and cytoplasmic tails that stabilize the resting integrin. The affinity of this heterodimer was comparable to the locked open L-I domain (approx. 500 nM) [35], suggesting that bonds in the active parent integrin play a similar role to the disulphide lock (Model B). An activating mutation to the inner surface of the C-terminal helix of L-I that is predicted to destabilize the closed conformation increased affinity by a factor of 6. The energy ladder for the truncated L2 integrin may therefore resemble that shown for the recombinant M-I domain (Figure 5A). For the M-I domain, although the affinity difference between the open and closed forms of M is probably similar to that of L-I (approx. 104 ), the equilibrium between the unliganded open and closed forms of the recombinant protein is much less pronounced (approx. 101 in favour of the closed conformer). This small energy difference (approx. 1.4 kCal · mol-1 ) provides a rationale for the ability of a ligand-mimetic lattice contact to induce the open conformation of M-I domain in the crystalline state [24]. Thus for M-I, a major role of the integrin head appears to be to stabilize the closed conformation, so that the quaternary switch to the active state involves release of the quaternary constraints in the inactive integrin (Model A). Whether these underlying mechanistic differences have functional consequences remains to be seen.
