The exosome is a protein complex that participates in a wide variety of RNA processing, degradation, and quality-control pathways. The exosome is conserved in all eukaryotes studied to date and is also present in many archaeal organisms, albeit in a simpler form. To gain insights into the architecture of the

exosome complex, we have chosen the hyperthermophilic archaeum Sulfolobus solfataricus as a model system. Here we describe the coexpression, purification, and crystal structure determination of archaeal exosome complexes. To understand how the archaeal exosome binds and degrades RNA, we designed RNA substrates for degradation experiments exploiting the knowledge of the geometric constraints of the exosome structure. Furthermore, we describe several crystal structures in which RNA substrates were diffused into crystals and how anomalous scattering from 5-iodo-uridine­modified RNA was used to locate low-occupancy RNA binding sites.

1. Introduction
The RNA degrading exosome was initially discovered in yeast strains with incorrectly processed 5.8 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Mitchell et al., 1997; see chapters in Maquat and Kiledjian, RNA Turnover, Part B). Since then, the exosome has been shown to play a number of important roles in RNA processing, degradation, and quality-control pathways (reviewed in Houseley et al., 2006). The eukaryotic exosome consists of a conserved core complex of 10 subunits present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The nuclear form of the eukaryotic exosome participates in the maturation of stable RNA precursors and in the rapid decay of defective messenger RNA (mRNA) precursors (Allmang et al., 1999; Bousquet-Antonelli et al., 2000; Briggs et al., 1998; Mitchell et al., 1997; van Hoof et al., 2000). In addition to the 10 core subunits, the nuclear exosome is known to associate with the hydrolytic RNase Rrp6 (Briggs et al., 1998) and to require the TRAMP complex for stimulation of its nuclease activity (LaCava et al., 2005; Vanacova et al., 2005; Wyers et al., 2005). The TRAMP complex is a macromolecular assembly containing a poly(A) polymerase (Trf4), a putative zinc-knuckle RNA-binding protein (Air1 or Air2), and a putative helicase (Mtr4). Besides the nuclear functions described previously, several roles have been reported for the cytoplasmic exosome. These include 30 to 50 -directed turnover of mRNA (Anderson and Parker, 1998) and quality control functions such as the removal of aberrant mRNAs that either lack a normal stop codon or contain a premature stop codon (Conti and Izaurralde, 2005; van Hoof et al., 2002). Both normal turnover of mRNA and the qualitycontrol pathways in the cytoplasm rely on the SKI complex as an activator of the exosome (reviewed in Houseley et al., 2006). The SKI complex also contains a putative helicase (Ski2) but is otherwise not homologous to the activating TRAMP complex found in the nucleus. Additional proteins of the SKI complex include the proteins Ski3 and Ski8 that are thought to mediate protein­protein interactions (Wang et al., 2005). In S. cerevisiae,

a protein (Ski7) with homology to translational elongation factors bridges the interaction between the exosome and the other SKI components (Araki et al., 2001). Ten different proteins of equal stoichiometry associate to form the yeast exosome core. Six of these subunits (ribosomal RNA­processing protein (Rrp) 41, Rrp42, Rrp43, Rrp45, Rrp46, and Mtr3) show significant sequence identity to RNase PH, a bacterial protein that cleaves transfer RNA (tRNA) precursors in a phosphate-dependent manner. As predicted from the structure of bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) (Symmons et al., 2000), the six RNase PH­like exosome proteins form a hexameric ring (reviewed in Buttner et al., 2006; Lorentzen and Conti, 2006; Vanacova and Stefl, 2007). Three additional proteins with putative RNAbinding domains (Rrp4, Rrp40, and Csl4) form a trimeric cap that associates with the hexamer. The tenth core subunit, Rrp44, is a hydrolytic RNase with sequence homology to members of the RNase II superfamily (Frazao et al., 2006; Zuo et al., 2006). Recent research has shown that only one subunit in either yeast or human core exosomes, the Rrp44 protein, has RNase activity (Dziembowski et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2006). Rrp44 hydrolyzes RNA substrates processively from the 30 -end and can degrade extensive regions of secondary structure provided that a short 30 -end overhang of single-stranded RNA is present (Dziembowski et al., 2007, Lorentzen et al., 2008). The exosome is not only conserved in eukaryotes but also in many archaeal organisms, although with a simpler subunit composition. Genomic analysis identified the four gene products Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp4, and Csl4 as likely constituents of the archaeal exosome (Koonin et al., 2001). The archaeal exosome does not seem to require association with an Rrp44 homolog or with activating components similar to the TRAMP or SKI complexes for activity. The archaeal Rrp41 and Rrp42 proteins also show homology to the RNase PH protein. Archaeal Rrp4 is homologous to the eukaryotic Rrp4 and Rrp40 subunits, whereas the archaeal Csl4 subunit displays homology to eukaryotic Csl4. In the hyperthermophilic archaeum Sulfolobus solfataricus, it was shown that these proteins indeed form a 300-kDa complex in vivo that is endowed with phosphorolytic RNase activity (Evguenieva-Hackenberg et al., 2003; Walter et al., 2006). The high molecular weight of the archaeal exosome and the clear homology to the eukaryotic exosome components suggested that the two complexes could have similar overall architectures (Koonin et al., 2001). In an endeavor to characterize the structure of the exosome and its mechanism of RNA degradation, we chose to study the exosome from the S. solfataricus. The rationale behind this choice is the simplicity of its subunit composition (advantageous in reconstituting a functional complex) and its thermostability (well known to increase the chances of obtaining high-resolution diffracting crystals). These factors, combined with the homology to eukaryotic exosomes, makes it feasible to use structure-based

sequence alignments to extrapolate the mechanistic insights obtained from the archaeal exosome structure to eukaryotes. Here, we describe the details of the methods leading to the atomic-level characterization of the architecture and RNA-binding sites of the S. solfataricus archaeal exosome.

2. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Reconstitution of an Archaeal Exosome
This section describes the production of abundant (milligram) quantities of pure S. solfataricus exosome complex suitable for biochemical and structural characterization. The complex was first reconstituted by mixing the subunits that had been individually overexpressed in bacterial cells and purified. The method has then been optimized to increase the speed of the purification protocol and the amount of material obtained by use of coexpression in E. coli.

2.1. Cloning of the S. solfataricus exosome genes
The four individual genes encoding the S. solfataricus exosome core (Rrp4, Rrp41, Rrp42, and Csl4) were originally cloned from genomic DNA into the pQE30 vector by E. Evguenieva-Hackenberg and coworkers and purified under denaturing conditions followed by refolding (described by Hackenberg et al., chapter 19 in this volume). For the purpose of crystallization, we subcloned the genes into pET-11b (which encodes an N-terminal hexa-His tag and ampicillin resistance), pET-28b (which encodes no tag and kanamycin resistance), and different pET-MCN vectors (which encode N-terminal His and/or GST tags and ampicillin resistance) by use of NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (Fribourg et al., 2001; Romier et al., 2006). The vectors encoding a His and/or GST tag all have an engineered tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site that allows removal of the tag after affinity purification (Carrington and Dougherty, 1988). This is routinely implemented for structural studies, because flexible termini of proteins can prevent successful crystallization. In addition, the pET-MCN vector facilitates easy construction of polycistronic expression vectors. The bicistronic Rrp41/Rrp42 construct was cloned into the pET-MCN vector by cutting out the insert of Rrp41 with SpeI and NheI restriction enzymes and ligating the inserts into a pET-MCN vector containing Rrp42 and cut with SpeI. The tricistronic Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 vector was then engineered by cutting out the Rrp4 insert with SpeI/NheI and ligating it into the Rrp41/Rrp42 bicistronic pET-MCN vector cut with SpeI. Each gene cloned into the polycistronic vector has its own ribosome-binding site and

encodes an N-terminal His tag. All vectors used for subsequent protein expression were sequenced with T7 polymerase primers.

2.2. Overexpression of the archaeal exosome components
Before initiating large-scale cultures, overexpression of the individual gene products was tested in small scale. Electrocompetent Bl21 (DE3) E. coli cells (50 ml) were mixed with 0.5 ml of plasmid. After transformation by electroporation, 500 ml of sterile Luria-Bertani (LB) medium without antibiotics was added, and the Eppendorf tubes were then left to shake at 200 rounds per minutes (rpm) at 37  C for 45 min. The solution was plated onto agar containing the antibiotic whose resistance is encoded by the transfected plasmid and left overnight at 37  C. On the following morning, single colonies were picked and transferred into 10 ml LB medium and grown to an OD600 of 0.8 at 37  C. Cultures were then left to cool down to 18  C for 2 h before inducing 3 to 4 h (or overnight) with 0.5 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Before adding IPTG, 0.4 ml of the culture was spun down and resuspended in 40 ml of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer for later use (uninduced sample). Experience in our laboratory suggests that many recombinantly expressed proteins give a higher yield of soluble protein when expressed at room temperature rather than at 37  C, and we, therefore, carry out low-temperature expression routinely. After induction, the cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 4  C and 4000 rpm and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A. Cells were lysed by sonication for 20 sec, and 40 ml of the lysate was removed and mixed with 40 ml of SDS loading buffer and stored for later use (induced sample). The rest of the lysate was spun for 10 min at 16,000g at 4  C. The supernatant was then mixed with 50 ml of Ni2þ-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) beads (preincubated with 1 ml of buffer A for 30 min) and left on a rolling table for 30 min at 4  C. The beads were then spun down at 2000 rpm and washed three times with buffer A before adding 40 ml of SDS loading buffer. Expression levels of the proteins were evaluated by running 5 ml of the crude extracts (uninduced and induced cells) and 10 ml of the Ni-TNA beads on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel (BioRad mini-gel system). Before loading, the samples were heated to 95  C for 2 min and spun at 16000g for 10 min. After small-scale expression, large-scale cultures (2 to 12 L) were grown to obtain milligram amounts of proteins for complex reconstitution and crystallization. Freshly transformed BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells were plated out with the appropriate antibiotic and left to grow overnight at 37  C. Grown bacteria were directly transferred into 3-L flasks containing 0.5 L of LB medium with sterile pipette tips. Usually, one plate contained enough bacteria to inoculate a total of six flasks. The cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.8 at 37  C with 200 rpm shaking. The temperature was then

422

adjusted to 18  C and the flasks left to cool down while still shaking for 3 h before induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. The bacteria were left to shake for 12 to 16 h (overnight) at room temperature.

2.3. Purification of archaeal exosome components
One of the advantages of working with proteins from hyperthermophilic organisms is the possibility of purifying the overexpressed thermostable protein by heat precipitation of the nonthermostable E. coli proteins. Cells were first lysed in buffer A (10 ml buffer per liter of grown culture) by four rounds of sonication, each 1 min long. After centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 45 min to remove insoluble material such as membranes, the solution was heated to 75  C for 30 min in a waterbath and again centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 45 min to remove the heat-precipitated E. coli proteins. After heat precipitation, the overexpressed proteins tended to be 70 to 90% pure. The protein or protein complex was then incubated in batch with 5 ml Ni-NTA resin on a rolling table for 30 min at 4  C, the resin spun down at 2000 rpm, resuspended in buffer A, and used to pack a column. After extensive washing with buffer A followed by buffer B (10 to 20 column volumes) a linear 0 to 200 mM imidazole gradient at 3 ml/min was carried out with an AKTA Explorer system (GE Healthcare) to elute the protein. The wash with buffer B containing 1 M NaCl was carried out to remove impurities, in particular nucleic acids from E. coli that might otherwise remain bound. Protein-containing fractions, as judged by A280 absorption, were further analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Fractions containing protein of the highest purity were combined and dialyzed overnight against at least a 20-fold (vol/vol) excess of buffer C. TEV protease was added to the dialysis membrane in a ratio of 1 mg protease per 50 mg of His-tagged protein. In general, adding TEV protease at the dialysis step reduces the purification time by cleaving the tag and removing the imidazole at the same time. The completeness of the cleavage was evaluated by SDS-PAGE, and the solution was passed over 1 ml NiNTA resin in a disposable column to remove the His-tagged TEV protease along with remaining traces of uncleaved protein. The protein was then concentrated with a Centricon (Millipore) with an appropriate molecular weight cutoff and loaded onto a Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in buffer C. The column was run at 0.5 ml/min, and protein-containing fractions were evaluated with SDS-PAGE. The four individual subunits all eluted from the column with molecular weights close to that predicted for a monomer. Pure fractions were combined and concentrated with a Centricon to 5 to 20 mg/ml for reconstitution.

Buffer A: 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl Buffer B: 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1.0 M NaCl Buffer C: 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl

2.4. In vitro reconstitution of archaeal exosome complexes
With all the four individual proteins purified, different subcomplexes could be reconstituted. Rrp41 and Rrp42 were mixed at a 1:1.5 ratio for 30 min at 20  C (protein concentrations between 1 and 10 mg/ml have been tested). Excess of Rrp42 was easily removed from the Rrp41/Rrp42 complex by passing the reconstitution mix over a Superdex 200 sizeexclusion chromatography column. The Rrp41/Rrp42 complex eluted as a 200-kDa complex and appeared to contain an equal number of Rrp41 and Rrp42 subunits as judged from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 20.1). Dynamic lightscattering experiments revealed a molecular mass of 170 kDa for the Rrp41/Rrp42 complex, consistent with a hexameric structure containing three Rrp41 and three Rrp42 subunits (the expected molecular weight of a hexameric complex is 174 kDa). To verify that the reconstituted exosome complex was active, RNA degradation experiments were performed (Lorentzen et al., 2005; Portnoy et al., 2005; Walter et al., 2006). These experiments were carried out by E. Evguenieva-Hackenberg and coworkers and are described in chapter 19 of this volume. The trimeric Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 complex was reconstituted by mixing purified Rrp41/Rrp42 complex with a fourfold molar excess of Rrp4 for 30 min at 20  C. Excess Rrp4 was removed by size-exclusion chromatography. The trimeric complex eluted with a molecular weight of 250 kDa and has a 1:1:1 stoichiometry as judged by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the complex contained three of each subunit. Similarly, a trimeric Rrp41/Rrp42/Csl4 complex containing three copies of each subunit could be reconstituted and purified. Attempts to purify a tetrameric complex resulted in substoichiometric

amounts of Rrp4 and Csl4. The degree of the substoichiometry depended on the relative amounts and the mixing order of subunits, suggesting that Rrp4 and Csl4 associate with the Rrp41/Rrp42 subcomplex through an overlapping binding site. This is consistent with published biochemical and structural analysis of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus exosome (Buttner et al., 2005). It is likely that different populations of the archaeal exosome containing different numbers of Rrp4 and Csl4 subunits exist in vivo, although the functional implications of this, if any, are currently not known.

2.5. Coexpression of archaeal exosome complexes
Although all four proteins of the S. solfataricus exosome could be individually expressed, yields were relatively low, particularly for Rrp41 (Table 20.1). In addition, Rrp41, Rrp4, and Csl4 all had a tendency to aggregate on purification. To overcome these limitations, we coexpressed the subunits so as to purify the exosome complexes directly. Coexpression of the Rrp41/Rrp42 subcomplex was carried out by using the same protocol as described previously for the individual components. Remarkably, the coexpression led to a fivefold increase in the soluble expression of Rrp41. This is likely to be due to a stabilization of the Rrp41 subunit by associating with Rrp42, which prevents degradation and/or aggregation of Rrp41. Although Rrp42 was present in approximately 50% excess compared with Rrp41 on Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, excess Rrp42 was readily removed by size exclusion chromatography. Similarly, the Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 exosome complex was coexpressed and resulted in a more than two-fold increase in the expression of the limiting subunit, Rrp41. The large amounts of pure Rrp41/Rrp42 and Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 obtained by coexpression were used for a detailed structural characterization of the complexes.

3. Archaeal Exosome Structure
Structure determination of macromolecular complexes often gives valuable insights into function and mechanism. In this section, we describe the structure determination of the archaeal exosome by X-ray crystallography and the use of chemically modified RNA to identify substrate-binding sites.

3.1. Crystallization of apo S. solfataricus Rrp41/Rrp42 and Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42
To obtain crystals of the archaeal exosome suitable for diffraction studies, we first screened approximately 900 crystallization conditions from commercial kits (Qiagen, Hampton Research, and Emerald Biostructure) in small scale (with a drop size of 0.2 ml). The crystallization screening was carried out with a Mosquito crystallization Robot (TTP Labtech), which can dispense accurate drop sizes of 0.1 to 0.2 ml into 96-well Greiner crystallization plates (Hampton research). For crystallization, the complexes were concentrated to 10 mg/ml after size exclusion chromatography (as judged by A280 measurements on a ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, NanoDrop). The Rrp41/Rrp42 complex yielded crystals in different screening conditions, generally characterized by high salt contents (sodium malonate or sodium citrate). The crystals grew at 18  C within 2 to 4 days. We then refined the conditions yielding the most promising crystals (as judged by their size and morphologic regularity) in larger format with 1 ml protein drops in 24-well sitting-drop plates (VDX plates, Hampton Research), with the same equilibrating technique (sitting-drop vapor diffusion). The conditions were refined by modifying the salt concentration and the pH value. The best crystals were obtained by mixing the Rrp41/Rrp42 complex at a concentration of 10 mg/ml with an equal volume of 50 mM MES and 2.0 to 2.4 M sodium malonate, pH 6.5 to 7.0, and equilibrating against a 500-ml reservoir at 18  C. The high salt concentration also served as a cryoprotectant for X-ray data collection, allowing the crystals to be cooled directly in the nitrogen stream without any ice formation. The Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and screened for crystallization conditions in the same way as the Rrp41/Rrp42 complex. Optimization was achieved by testing the effect of the buffer type and pH, as well as the type of PEG (several different molecular weights) and its concentration. Crystals of the highest quality were obtained by mixing the protein complex with an equal amount of 40% PEG 400, 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, and equilibrated by sitting-drop vapor diffusion against a well containing 500 ml of the precipitant solution. Crystals grew to a maximum dimension of 0.2 mm within 2 days at 18  C.

Both the Rrp41/Rrp42 and Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 complexes yielded crystals with freshly prepared sample, as well as sample stored at À80  C after flash freezing in liquid nitrogen (without the addition of any glycerol). Crystals were reproducibly obtained with different batches of protein with samples either purified from coexpression or reconstituted after individual purification. Complexes of S. solfataricus Rrp41/Rrp42/Csl4 and Rrp4/ Rrp41/Rrp42/Csl4 were also extensively screened for crystallization conditions at different concentrations (between 5 and 15 mg/ml) at both 4  C and 18  C with freshly prepared complexes from several different purification batches. No crystals of diffraction quality were obtained for S. solfataricus Rrp41/Rrp42/Csl4 or Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42/Csl4.

3.2. Structure determination of the Rrp41-Rrp42 complex
Crystals of S. solfataricus Rrp41/Rrp42 reproducibly diffracted X-rays to a ° maximum resolution of 2.8 A at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) X06SA synchrotron beam line (Villigen, Switzerland) (Lorentzen et al., 2005). ° Because of a large unit cell with the longest cell dimension of 440 A, the diffraction data were collected with the MarCCD 225 detector at SLS and fine slicing with a D' of 0.2 to avoid overlaps between reflections. The crystals are of space group C2221 and appeared to contain a large number of Rrp41/Rrp42 copies (8 to 16 as judged from the predicted solvent content of the crystals). Indexing and scaling of the diffraction data with the program XDS (Kabsch, 1993) gave superior results to other processing programs, probably because of a better handling of the finely sliced data. The structure of the Rrp41/Rrp42 complex was solved by molecular replacement with the previously solved bacterial RNase PH (pdb code 1YOR) as a search model in the program PHASER (Storoni et al., 2004). RNase PH is a homohexamer (trimer of dimers) that phosphorolytically cleaves the 30 -end of tRNA precursors (Harlow et al., 2004). Despite the relatively low sequence identity of 19% between Rrp42 and bacterial RNase PH (28% for Rrp41), a clear solution with four hexamers was ° found. Data were only included up to 6 A for the rotation and translation functions to speed up the procedure, while the final refinement and phasing were done with all available data. The log likelihood function in PHASER increased considerably with each hexamer found until a total of four hexamers were included and without further gain for a potential fifth hexamer. The four hexamers in the asymmetric unit pack into a tetrahedron giving a crystal solvent content of 60%. Despite the clear molecular replacement solution, the resulting electron density maps suffered heavily from model bias, making rebuilding rather ambiguous (Fig. 20.2). Maps were significantly improved by carrying out density modification with noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging of the twelve identical copies of Rrp41/Rrp42 in the asymmetric unit with

Figure 20.2 Effects of density modification techniques on the resulting electron density maps. The map shown in the left panel was calculated with phases from molecular replacement with the 25% sequence identity model of RNase PH solvent flattened in the program DM. The right panel shows the same part of a map calculated with phases in which 12-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging was used in combination with solvent flattening.

the CCP4 program DM (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). Similarly to previous crystallographic work on high-symmetry particles ° ° such as viruses, phases were only included to 5 A. Beyond 5 A the Fc and Fo showed a very poor correlation. Fc represents the calculated structure factors from the molecular replacement model and Fo the observed structure ° factors for the Rrp41/Rrp42 complex. Phases were extended from 5 A to ° in 1000 cycles of density modification by applying NCS matrices 2.8 A extracted from superposing dimers from the molecular replacement solution, leading to a greatly improved electron density map (see Fig. 20.2). Whereas bacterial RNase PH contains just one monomer, Rrp41 and Rrp42 adopt the same overall fold but share only 20% sequence identity. In the procedure, it was thus important to correctly average the same subunit among the four hexamers (Rrp41 with Rrp41 and Rrp42 with Rrp42). In total there are 8 (23) different ways to perform the averaging among the four different hexamers, with only one way being correct. Fortuitously, the four hexamers in the asymmetric unit obeyed point group symmetry, allowing averaging to be carried out unambiguously. If this were not the case, it would have been necessary to test each of the eight possible averaging protocols and compare the resulting electron density maps. The Rrp41/Rrp42 heterodimer was manually built into the maps with the RNase PH protein as guidance in the programs O ( Jones et al., 1991) and COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). Refinement of the atomic coordinates against the diffraction data was carried out in the program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) with tight NCS restraints between equivalent Rrp41/Rrp42 dimers.

3.3. Structure determination of the Rrp4/ Rrp41/Rrp42 complex
The Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 crystals were of high quality and diffracted X-rays ° to a maximum resolution of 1.6 A at the Swiss light source (SLS) synchrotron (Villigen, Switzerland), beam line X06SA (Lorentzen et al., 2007). The crystals belong to the cubic space group P213, contain one Rrp4/Rrp41/ Rrp42 heterotrimer in the asymmetric unit, and have a solvent content of 47%. The biologically relevant oligomer is a trimer of heterotrimers that is created by a three-fold symmetry axis in the crystal. The previously determined Rrp41/Rrp42 crystal structure (see earlier) was used as a molecular replacement model for initial phasing in the program PHASER. The maps based on model phases from the resulting solution showed poor and disconnected electron density for Rrp4. Attempts to place the previously determined structure of A. fulgidus Rrp4 (Buttner et al., 2005) did not yield a promising solution. However, solutions could be obtained in a separate search with the N-terminal region of Rrp4 and with the C-terminal S1/KH region. With hindsight, the reason why the search with the full-length Rrp4 protein failed is because of a conformational ° change characterized by an 8 A domain movement in Rrp4 of the A. fulgidus exosome relative to the S. solfataricus exosome. The resulting map showed clear electron density for Rrp4 and allowed model building of this subunit in the program COOT. The structure was refined with REFMAC. The Rrp4 subunit displays weaker electron density than the hexameric Rrp41/Rrp42 core even in the fully refined structure. Analysis of the relative temperature factors in the structure of Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 showed that the Rrp4 protein has an average temperature factor twice as high as that of the Rrp41/Rrp42 core, suggesting it has more pronounced flexibility. The overall structure of the S. solfataricus exosome displays a barrel-like architecture with the Rrp4 protein forming a trimeric cap atop of the Rrp41/Rrp42 hexameric ring. The central channel of the Rrp4 cap forms a continuous pore with the channel of the hexamer. This architecture is consistent with that observed for the A. fulgidus and P. abyssi exosomes (Buttner et al., 2005, Navarro et al., 2008), for the human exosome core (Liu et al., 2006), and for bacterial PNPase (Symmons et al., 2000) and seems to be evolutionarily conserved (Lorentzen and Conti, 2006).

4. RNA Binding Sites in the Archaeal Exosome
The structures of the archaeal exosome revealed the overall architecture but did not show how the complex recruits and degrades RNA. This section describes the methods we used to visualize RNA substrates bound to the exosome. To achieve binding without degradation, we diffused RNA

molecules either into crystals of the wild-type exosome in the absence of phosphate or in crystals of a catalytically inactive mutant. To assess the access route of the RNA substrates reaching the exosome active site, we characterized the substrate requirement biochemically, and we made use of modified RNA to unambiguously model the substrate in the electron density.

4.1. Structures of oligoribonucleotides bound at the archaeal exosome active site
To identify the mode of RNA binding at the active site of the hexameric RNase PH-like ring, crystals of Rrp41/Rrp42 were incubated in solutions containing short 5 to 10 nucleotide (nt) RNA molecules (Lorentzen and Conti, 2005). Because of the phosphorolytic nature of RNA degradation by the archaeal exosome (Lorentzen et al., 2005), these experiments were initially carried out with the native protein complex with the buffer solution devoid of inorganic phosphate. Equilibrated drops containing Rrp41/ Rrp42 crystals with an approximate volume of 1 ml were mixed with 0.2 ml of the following solutions adjusted to a pH value of 7.0 with MES buffer: 10 mM of either A5, U8, or A10 RNA (Dhamacon, 20 -deprotected and desalted but not PAGE-purified) or 100 mM of ADP. Soaking time before flash cooling was 5 min for the ADP and A5 molecules and 10 min for the larger U8 and A10 molecules. Despite being relative short, the soaking time allowed the RNA ligands to diffuse into the crystals. This is probably because of the large solvent channels in the Rrp41/Rrp42 crystals that have 60% solvent content allowing the ligands to readily diffuse through the crystal. As typical for soaked crystals, the diffraction for the complexes was of somewhat lower quality than for the apo structures. The visualization of ° RNA substrates and the ADP was, however, clear in the 2.8 to 3.3 A resolution data sets. Electron density maps were calculated by use of model phases after rigid-body refinement and refinement of the atomic coordinates and B factors in REFMAC. The maps showed the well-ordered binding of 4 nt of RNA at the active site. The nucleotides interact mainly by means of phosphate-backbone interactions with conserved arginine residues located in a binding groove between the Rrp41 and Rrp42 subunits (Lorentzen and Conti, 2005). Somewhat surprisingly, the high salt concentration of the crystallization condition (2.0 to 2.4 M sodium malonate) did not interfere with the electrostatic RNA-protein interactions.

4.2. RNA degradation experiments to probe the RNA access route
The structures of the wild-type RNase PH core bound to short oligoribonucleotides provided a snapshot of the catalytic site and suggested that recruitment of substrates to the active site occurs by means of the central channel of

430

the exosome complex. However, these structures did not reveal from which side of the central channel substrate recruitment occurs. To probe this biochemically, we designed RNA substrates on the basis of the geometry of the exosome structure. The design was based on the knowledge that the archaeal exosome stalls on encountering RNA substrates with stable secondary structure. The structure of the Rrp41-Rrp42 complex shows a barrel-like architecture with a central channel that is open at both ends. The active site of the complex is located at the end of a solvent-shielded grove, 4 nt in length and perpendicular to the central channel (Fig. 20.3). One end of the central ° channel of the barrel-like structure has a wide opening (25 A), whereas the ° other end has more restricted access with an opening of only 10 A. From the crystal structure it is possible to measure distances and predict that an RNA ° substrate approaching from the 25 A wide opening would require at least 4 nt of single-stranded overhang to reach the site of catalysis. However, if ° the substrate approached from the other 10 A wide pore, it would require at least 9 nt of single-stranded RNA. To experimentally test these two possibilities, degradation experiments were carried out with substrates with a stable 8 base-pair stem loop at the 50 -end and 5, 10, 15, or 25 nucleotides of single-stranded poly(A) overhang at the 30 -end: 50 -CCCCCCCCGAAAGGGGGGGGAAAAA-30 .

The architecture suggests that there are two different possible paths for RNA recruitment. (A) RNA can be recruited from ° the 25-A wide end in which case only 4 nt of single-stranded RNA overhang is required to reach the active site. (B) Alternately, RNA substrates can be recruited from the nar° rower 10 A pore located farther from the active site. In this case 9 nt of single-stranded RNA is required to reach the active site. (C) RNA degradation experiment with stem loop^containing RNA molecules having different lengths of single-stranded overhang. The experiment shows a final product with 8^9 nt of single-stranded overhang, indicating that substrate recruitment by the archaeal exosome occurs from the more restricted ° 10 A wide pore (Lorentzen and Conti, 2006).

The RNA degradation experiment was carried out as follows: 5 mg (29 pmol) of Rrp41/Rrp42 wild-type complex was incubated with 5 mg (1.5 nmol) RNA in 40 ml total volume of buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 60 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 U/ml RNasin, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 2 mM DTT at 70  C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of loading buffer containing 8 M urea, 10% glycerol, 1Â TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) and bromophenol blue, and placing the tubes on ice. Reaction products were resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea and 1Â TBE. The gel was prerun for 15 min in 1Â TBE buffer and unpolymerized acrylamide was removed from the wells before loading of the sample. Products of the RNA degradation experiments were visualized directly by staining for 5 min in 0.1% toluidine followed by destaining in water. One advantage of carrying out the assay at high temperature, at which the thermostable exosome complex is very active, is that any trace contaminants of RNases are likely to be heat inactivated. The results from these experiments showed that the archaeal Rrp41Rrp42 complex requires at least 8 to 9 nt of single-stranded RNA for activity (see Fig. 20.3). The smaller RNA molecule with only 5 nt of single-stranded overhang was not degraded at all, whereas the RNA molecules with longer tails (10 to 25 nt) were all partly degraded giving the same product with 8 to 9 nt of overhang. This is consistent with a model where ° RNA substrates are recruited by way of the more restricted 10 A opening and channeled through the central pore to the active sites.

4.3. Structures with 5-iodo-uridine RNA substrates to visualize the RNA access route
To obtain the structure of the entire exosome with a substrate bound both at the active site and at the access route, we diffused Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 crystals with larger RNA molecules containing stable secondary structure (Lorentzen et al., 2007). With the knowledge from the structural and biochemical experiments described in the previous sections, we designed RNA molecules to probe for additional binding sites. Because our biochemical experiments showed that the archaeal exosome recruits RNA ° through a pore 10 A wide at its narrowest point, we expected an RNA molecule with a stable stem loop to stall at and reveal the exact position of substrate entrance. Soaking was done with the following RNA molecules at a final concentration of 0.3 mM added to the mother liquor: 50 -CCCCCCCCGAAAGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-30 50 -CCCCCGAAAGGGGGUIUIUIUIUIUIUIUIUIUIUIUIUIUIUI-30 The molecules contain a stable GC stem loop at the 50 -end followed by 15 nucleotides of single-stranded RNA tail. The rationale behind the use of such a substrate is that although the tail can enter the exosome complex and bind at the

432

Esben Lorentzen and Elena Conti

active site, the stem-loop structure should stall at the entrance site. For the second substrate, UI indicates that the uracil base has been chemically modified with iodide (5-iodo-uridine, commercially available at Dharmacon). The idea behind the use of such a modified substrate is that iodide gives a strong anomalous signal at longer X-ray wavelengths and can thus be used to identify even weak RNA binding sites. The relatively low concentration of 0.3 mM of the RNA molecules was used because of their low solubility in the mother liquor containing a high concentration of PEG. Short soaking times of 10 to 60 min resulted in empty RNA binding sites. This was probably because of the larger size and lower concentration of the RNA substrates, the high viscosity of the 40% PEG 400 condition, as well as the smaller size of the solvent channels in the Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 crystals compared with the Rrp41/Rrp42 crystals. To overcome these problems, a longer soaking time of 16 h was used. To ensure stability of the RNA during the long soaking time, the experiments were carried out with a catalytically dead exosome complex containing a point mutation (D182A) in the Rrp41 subunit (Lorentzen et al., 2005). Crystals soaked with RNA molecule 1 diffracted at best to a ° resolution of 2.3 A. The resulting electron density maps revealed an additional RNA-binding site located at of the entrance of central channel at the side where the Rrp4 trimeric cap associates with the Rrp41/Rrp42 hexamer. One additional nucleotide with electron density of sufficient quality to be modeled was found at the neck of the complex where the channel is ° the most constricted with a diameter of 10 A, only wide enough to accommodate one RNA chain at a time. The archaeal exosome has three-fold symmetry, and the crystallographic structure, which is an average of all the exosome complexes in the crystal, thus has three identical binding sites, each with an occupancy of one third. In addition to the one nucleotide identified in the channel, four nucleotides of RNA could be traced at the active site. The modeled RNA was given occupancies of either one third or 1 in separate refinements in REFMAC. The temperature factors of this nucleotide refined to values similar to those of the surrounding protein residues only with an occupancy of one third, confirming that only one RNA chain can enter the archaeal exosome at any given time. These results are in agreement with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments that also showed a stoichiometry of 1:3 (Oddone et al., 2007). The relatively good resolution of the data allowed us to model the RNA despite the low occupancy and resulting weaker density. To confirm the binding site, ° anomalous data were collected on RNA molecule 2 with a long (1.55 A) X-ray wavelength where iodide has a considerable anomalous signal. ° Although the diffraction data extended to 2.5 A resolution, the anomalous ° signal was detectable only up to 4 A. Anomalous maps were calculated from ° the anomalous differences in the resolution range of 50 to 4 A with phases calculated from the Rrp4/Rrp41/Rrp42 model after rigid body refinement and restrained refinement of atomic coordinates and temperature factors

° against all the data extending to 2.5 A resolution. The resulting maps clearly allowed the identification of the iodide-labeled uracil base confirming the binding site found with substrate 1. The data further suggest that uracil and adenine bases bind in similar ways in the central channel of the archaeal exosome. The results described in this section demonstrate the synergy of biochemical and structural approaches. The results of the RNA degradation experiments described in Section 4.2 could not have been mechanistically interpreted in the absence of the 3D structure of the exosome. In turn, the information from the RNA degradation experiments was used in the rational design of RNA substrates for further structural studies.
