1. Introduction Diabetes is the fourth leading killer disease in the developed world. There are more than 200 million diabetics worldwide, accounting for a huge economic and social burden.1,2 Thus, the development of new effective therapeutic agents is the major thrust for research and is germane to both the national and international scenario. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most important type of diabetes, as more than 80% of diabetics are of this class. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are legitimate molecular targets for the development of the antidiabetic agents. The reported synthetic ligands such as rosiglitazone (I) and pioglitazone (II)3,4 had high affinity for PPAR-c receptor, belong to the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic agents (Fig. 1), and have significantly improved the clinical situation of Type 2 diabetics with serious side effects of hepatotoxicity, weight gain, and edema. This situation emphasized the need to identify strategies to develop new antihyperglycemic agents that could retain the insulin

sensitizing properties of TZDs through PPARc with minimum or no adverse side effects. This necessitated a search for highly effective, safe, and orally active antihyperglycemic agents, particularly those that normalize both insulin and glucose levels. The PPARs play a significant role in regulating the storage and catabolism of dietary fats, discovered5,6 in early 1990s. The X-ray analysis7 of PPAR-c bound with rosiglitazone reveals that carbonyl groups of the TZD form hydrogen bonds with two histidine residues, H323 and H449, of PPAR-c target receptor and Y473 in the AF-2 helix forms a secondary hydrogen bond. The partially negatively charged nitrogen of the TZD head group is within hydrogen-bonding distance from the OH group of the Y473 side chain. All of these primary and secondary hydrogen bonds result in a fixed conformation of the TZD head group and of the participating amino acids. Based on the ligand≠receptor binding knowledge, the synthesis of new prototype structures 3 (Fig. 2) has been

initiated to develop a better drug candidate for treating T2DM. Prototype 3 is a pyran-2-one-based derivative and its importance is greatly realized due to its unique structural features and diverse pharmacological properties.8≠12 With careful structural analysis of pyran derivatives, it was understood that the replacement of TZD head group by pyran nucleus as a new chemical entity may retain the antihyperglycemic activity. A flexible alignment of the synthesized compounds with rosiglitazone (I) was performed using the advanced program MOE-Flex Align,13 to determine their conformational and pharmacophoric relation using I and II as a template for the (virtual) superimposition (Fig. 3) and scoring (Table 1). Each alignment is given a score that quantifies the quality of the alignment in terms of both internal strain (U) and overlap of molecular features (S). Figure 4 shows significant alignment indicated by superimposition of the middle phenoxy ring and similarities in the head group pyran (3a) and thiazolidinedione ring of rosiglitazone (I). The carbonyl oxygen of thiazolidinedione is considered as the most essential pharmacophore for the binding with the PPAR. Projection of pyran ring toward thiazolidinedione region of I as in Figure 4, prompted to visualize its importance to act as a head group. Further, we applied a receptor-based approach to the validation of our hypothesis regarding the substitution of the pyran ring in place of thiazolidinedione. This approach essentially searches for a ligand whose orientation and conformation achieve the highest degree of

complementarity with respect to all details of the receptor’s steric constraints and interaction geometries. A successful solution to the docking problem comprises the generation of relevant binding modes (‘poses’) of the ligand and the correct ranking of each pose, and it is essential for the success of virtual screening approaches in structure-based drug design. It requires docking tools that are able to generate suitable configuration and conformations of a ligand within a protein binding site and energy measurements describing the quality of the interactions. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm AutoDock 3.0.514 has been implemented as a more efficient alternative for docking. The X-ray conformation7 (green) and AutoDock predicted structure (red) of rosiglitazone I have been superimposed in Figure 5 to define the parameters of the program. The root mean square deviation ∞ between these two conformations is $0.8 A, indicating that the parameter set for the AutoDock simulation is reasonable to reproduce the X-ray structure. Therefore, the AutoDock method and the parameter set could be extended to search the binding conformations for other ligands accordingly. Table 2 shows the calculated energies and docked results from the compound 3a with the comparison of docked rosiglitazone. Figure 6 shows the 3D docked model of compound 3a with PPAR-c and illustrates the probable binding conformational alignment of this compound with comparison of I (red). H-bonding is one of the important characteristics of the ligand≠receptor interaction. From these above

silico analyses, we may consider pyran as a head group in lieu of thiazolidinedione. 2. Chemistry The ketene dithioacetals15,16 (2a≠c) have been used as synthon for the synthesis of various pyran derivatives by reaction with aryl methyl ketones. Numerous highly functionalized 2H-pyran-2-ones have been prepared from 4hydroxy acetophenone. The reaction of 1,2-dibromoethane with 4-hydroxy acetophenone in the presence of K2CO3 provided 1-[4-(2-bromoethoxy)phenyl]ethanone (1) as a major product. Reaction of ketone 1 with methyl 2-substituted-3,3-bis-methylsulfanylacrylate (2) in the presence of potassium hydroxide provided the corresponding 2H-pyran-2-one derivatives (3).17 The intermediate 4, used for the preparation of 5, was obtained from the reaction of 1 with secondary amine in DMF. Thus, various 3,6-disubstituted-4-methylsulfanyl-2H-pyran-2ones (5) were synthesized by base-catalyzed condensation≠cyclization of aryl methyl ketone (4) with 217 (Scheme 1). All the synthesized compounds were characterized by their spectroscopic and elemental analyses.20 The IR spectrum of one of the compound 3b showed two bands at m 1706 and 2209 cm¿1 due to CO and CN groups, respectively. 1H NMR spectrum of 3b showed two triplets at d 1.27 and 1.46 ppm due to two methyl groups and two quartets at d 2.61 and 3.19 for two methylene protons of SCH2CH3 substituents. Two methylene groups of linker resonated at d 2.91 and d 4.19 ppm as triplet for SCH2 and OCH2, respectively. A singlet of pyran ring proton appears at 6.6 ppm while peaks at d 6.97≠7.9 ppm were attributed to the aromatic protons. The FAB mass peak at 362 supported the proposed structure. Finally, the structure of 3b was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis.18

The conformation of 3b along with the atom numbering scheme is shown in Figure 7. X-ray crystal structure showed that one molecule is in the asymmetric unit. The co-planarity was found between pyran and phenoxy ring; phenoxy ring is twisted with 7.88 (1)∞ from the mean plane of the pyran ring. As expected, this planarity can be attributed to weak intramolecular H-bond [C13≠ ∞ ∞ H13¡ ¡ ¡O1; H¡ ¡ ¡A = 2.38 A, D¡ ¡ ¡A = 2.72 A (1) and h(DHA) = 100.9∞].

Compounds were tested in quadruple at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 nM. Each compound was tested in at least two separate experiments. The activity of a compound is calculated as fold induction compared to an untreated sample.

3. Results and discussion Our objective was to design pyran-based PPAR-c ligands to identify lead structures through an in silico approach to evaluate their transactivation response. It is evident from the first series of designed and synthesized compounds 3a≠c that the compounds displayed (Table 3) significant increases in activation response. Oxidation of both the methylsulfanyl groups in 3a to its corresponding sulfoxide 8 reduced the activity profile of the compound. Exchange of methylsulfanyl group by highly hydrophobic phenylsulfanyl substituent in 7 drastically reduced the activity. In attempts to obtain more active compounds, sec-amino groups were introduced in lieu of SCH3 in the linker. A series of compounds 5a≠g were prepared and evaluated for their agonistic property but none of them displayed any significant activity. 4. Biological activity Of various compounds evaluated in in vitro PPARtransactivation assay, only three compounds, 3a≠c, demonstrated significant transactivation responses. This study made it possible to modify the structure of 3a to obtain more compounds as potent PPAR-activators. Thus, it was imperative to generate information through computational analyses including docking and molecular simulations with iterative synthesis and biological screening.
