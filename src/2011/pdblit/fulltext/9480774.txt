1. Summary

Goat and rabbit polyclonal reagents can be raised which recognize a new isotype of bovine antibodies. The polyclonal goat reagent was raised against a preparation enriched in the major IgG2 isotype (IgG2a) which contained the new isotype as a contaminant. The polyclonal rabbit reagent was prepared against a trypsin-derived Fc fraction of bovine IgG1 which contained the Fc of the new isotype as a contaminant. This new isotype is present in the sera of the cattle of all breeds tested regardless of their IgG2a allotype and is antigenically distinct from IgG2a, IgG1, IgA, IgM and IgE. The new isotype coelutes from DEAE anion exchangers with IgGl and the more acidic populations of IgG2a. The isotype is tentatively designated IgG2b. The distribution of IgG2b antibody activity to E. coli K99 and phosphorylcholine among 15 cattle of different A allotypes is not correlated with the IgG2a or IgG1 antibody activity in these animals.

2. Introduction

The heterogeneity of bovine IgG was recognized but not defined in a number of early publications [1, 2]. Eventually, electrophoretically "slow" and "fast" IgG [3, 4] were designated and eventually the immunochemically discrete subclasses IgG1 and IgG2 were recognized [5]. KickhSfen et al. [6] desigKey words: BovineIgG2b Correspondence to: J.E. Butler,Dept. of Microbiology,Univer-

nated three IgG proteins, "-~3s", "IgGl" and "IgG2". The former was later recognized as the same protein designated as IgG1 by others [7] while IgG1 and IgG2 became re-designated as IgG2a and IgG2b, respectively [8]. Unfortunately, this designation of the IgG subpopulation as IgG2a and IgG2b was based on ion-exchange behavior and early studies on amino acid composition [7]. As it has been shown that the ion-exchange behavior of bovine IgG1 and IgG2 is in itself not a satisfactory criterion for the designation of subclasses [9-11] the definition of bovine IgG heterogeneity, especially that for IgG2, remained unresolved. Recently, the differential affinity of bovine IgG for Protein-A has been used to separate IgG2 subpopulations although no evidence was presented that these subpopulations were antigenically different [12]. The absence of naturally-occurring or inducible paraproteins in cattle, has restricted the identification of IgG subclasses to the characterization of the bovine heavy chain genome or to the production of polyclonal or monoclonal reagents which recognize IgG isotypes not ascribable as intraspecies genetic variants, i.e. allotypes. In cattle, allotypic markers on IgG2 have been identified [13] and these have been more recently shown to be confined to a'subpopulation of IgG2 which we have designated IgG2a [14, 15]. In this report, we describe a new bovine isotype using goat and rabbit polyclonal antisera. The antibody is tentatively designated IgG2b.

City, IA), from steers used in the production of passive antibodies to C. perfringens (Diamond Laboratories, Des Moines, IA), cattle immunized with B. abortus vaccine (Los Alamos Laboratories, NM) and animals in the dairy herd at Beltsville, MD and Louisiana State University, were used in this research. Sera were typed for their A-allotype using either radial diffusion or an indirect competitive ELISA [15]. 3.2. Source of antiglobulin Antiglobulins specific for bovine IgG2a, IgG1, IgA and IgM were prepared as described elsewhere [16-18] as were the anti-allotypic reagents employed [14, 15]. All reagents were rendered isotype or allotype specific on affinity columns prepared either using CNBr-activated Sepharose [17, 19] or using CDIactivated Trisacryl [15]. Rabbit anti-bovine IgE was kindly provided by Dr. Klaus Nielsen, Health of Animals Bureau, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. AntiIgG2 reagents recognizing additional determinants (see Fig. 1), including those we ascribe to IgG2b, were raised in rabbits and goats. 3.3. Ion-exchange fractionation The globulin fraction of the sera of abattoir cattle, obtained by precipitation with 40°70 saturated ammonium sulfate (SAS), was fractionated on DEAE-Sephadex as previously described [11, 16-18]. After the isocratic elution of the basic populations of IgG2a, typically in multiple peaks [11], a linear salt gradient of NaC1 was applied. This generated additional peaks, including a major one highly enriched in IgG1 (see Fig. 2). It is possible to modify this typical elution pattern by slight alterations in ionic strength and pH after the first IgG2 peak has been eluted isocratically, to obtain a second IgG2-enriched fraction (see Results and Fig. 3). The elution of protein from DEAE-Sephadex was monitored at 280 nm and that of IgG2a and IgG1 was monitored by single radial diffusion (SRD) and using an indirect competitive ELISA [11, 15]. 3.4. Protein-A affinity chromatography Forty to 50 mg of IgG2A, IgG1 or an IgG fraction containing IgG2b, was incubated with a 3 ml column of Protein-A Trisacryl (binding capacity for human IgG = 10 mg/ml) overnight at 4 °C in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. Thereafter, unbound 32

protein was eluted and the various bound fractions eluted stepwise using buffers of progressively lower pH as described by Ey et al. [20]. Total eluted protein was measured by absorbancy at 280 nm, IgG1 and IgG2 were quant:'tated using an indirect competitive ELISA and IgG2b-specific antibody activity was measured using the a-ELISA. 3.5. Immunoprecipitin assays Immunodiffusion was performed in 25 mm plastic Petri dishes [21] and single radial diffusion (SRD) was performed as described by Mancini et al. [22]. 3.6. Measurement specific antibody activity The isotype-specific antibody activity of various bovine sera and Protein-A column fractions was measured using the a-ELISA. Briefly, Immulon 2® microtiter plates were coated with phosphorylcholine, (PC)-gelatin, dansyl (DANS)-ovalbumin or a sonicate ofE. coli K99. The conjugation of the hapten PC and DANS to their carriers has been previously described [23]. Chimeric anti-DANS bovine IgE was affinity-purified from tissue culture fluids kindly provided by Dr. K. L. Knight, University of Illinois, Chicago. All assays were performed using the most recent modifications of the a-ELISA assay and data acquisition and analysis was performed using ELISANALYSIS [24, 25].

4. Results

The multiple specificities of heterologous, polyclonal anti-bovine IgG2 reagents had been previously documented [14, 18] and can be demonstrated using SRD (Fig. 1). The most common cause of such heterogeneity, illustrated by rabbit antiserum 84b3,2, is the occurrence of two precipitin halos with animals heterozygous for the A-locus allotype and single, but qualitatively different halos with A1/A1 and A2/A2 homozygous cattle. A second type of heterogeneity in SRD is demonstrated by goat 223 in which two halos are seen with homozygous cattle and three with A1/A2 heterozygotes. These multiple halos are difficult to reproduce photographically so that sketches have also been supplied (Fig. 1, bottom). When bovine serum globulins are fractionated in DEAE-Sephadex, IgG2 elutes in nearly every frac-

tion (Fig. 2; [18]). However, with some manipulation of ionic strength, the IgG2 of most cattle can be eluted in two major peaks (Fig. 3); the bulk of the IgG1 elutes later (data partially shown). When the distribution of IgG2a (defined as the IgG2 bearing the A allotype) and IgG1 is measured by SRD, the major immunoglobulin eluted in both peaks is IgG2a although IgG1 is also present in Fraction II. When Fractions I, IIa and IIb are assayed by ID using goat 223, Fraction II can be seen to contain an additional precipitin line which remains after absorption with Fraction I (Fig. 3, right). Gel permeation chromatography (data not shown) indicated that all proteins in Fraction IIa and IIb were of the size of monomeric IgG. The "223 antigen" is not IgG1 nor does it precipitate bovine L-chains (Fig. 3, right), but is detectable in a trypsin-derived Fc preparation

one or several smaller peaks. Initiation of a salt gradient results in the emergence of a small "shoulder" peak followed by a very large, IgGl-enriched fraction. The small shoulder is antigenically similar to Fraction II of Fig. 3; it contains both IgG2a and IgG1 but also the "223 antigen" (Fig. 2). The presence of the "223 antigen" in this shoulder (e.g. Fraction 114, Fig. 2) could also be faintly detected by ID using goat 223. The precipitin line between Fraction 114 and anti"IgG2b" (i.e. goat 223) forms a line of non-identity with a goat anti-IgG2a reagent (Fig. 4). We will hereafter refer to the "223 antigen" as IgG2b (Fig. 4). The use of Protein-A to distinguish ruminant IgG has been reported [26, 27] including identification of "IgG2a" and "IgG2b" [12]. We investigated the possibility that the IgG2b we describe could be purified by this method. Fractions obtained when IgG2a, IgG1 or an IgG2b-rich fraction were applied to Protein-A Trisacryl and eluted at pH 8, 6, 5, 4 and 3 were assayed for IgG2a and IgG1 using an indirect competitive ELISA, and for the antibody activity of the "IgG2b isotype" using the a-ELISA. Ninetyseven percent of the applied IgG1 failed to bind Protein-A Trisacryl while 91°70of the IgG2a failed to bind. Eight percent of the IgG2a was subsequently eluted at pH 6. IgG2b antibody activity to PC could be detected both in the unbound and pH 6 fractions. The possibility that the antibody we describe as

IgG2b could be bovine IgE, was tested by permitting chimeric anti-DANS bovine IgE to bind DANSovalbumin and then assaying the in situ bound antibody using a spectrum of anti-bovine Ig reagents (Fig. 5). Anti-IgE from Klaus Nielsen reacted strongly with the chimeric antibody but anti-IgA, anti-IgM, anti-IgG2a, anti-IgG2b and anti-IgG1

failed to react. Only data for the IgG isotypes and anti-IgE are given. Bovine sera contain low levels of antibody to a spectrum of environmental antigens. Table 1 summarizes the results obtained with 15 cattle from five different breeds and different A-allotypes, to PC and E. coli K99. "Total activity" toward either was determined using an anti-Fab reagent and'arbitrarily assigned a value of 100 ELISA units/ml [24, 25]. The activity to the antigens in the three bovine IgG subisotypes, was then expressed relative to "total activity", i.e. 100 EU/ml. Data show that the presence of IgG2b antibody activity is: (1) unrelated to the Aallotype of the cattle, (2) not correlated with breed, and (3) distributed independently of IgG1 or IgG2a antibody activity to these antigens. 36

5. Discussion

The data presented in this report indicate that the antigenic moiety recognized by goat 223 and its rabbit counterpart, is an antibody isotype distinct from IgG2a, IgG1, IgA, IgM and IgE. The IgG2-specific reagents used in Fig. 1 do not recognize IgG1 and after absorption of goat 223 with Fraction I (Fig. 3), this antiserum no longer recognizes IgG2a (F × n I) or IgG1. Although no physical chemical data are presented for this antibody, we do indicate that the trypsin-generated Fc fragment of bovine IgG contains the "223 antigen" as a contaminant. Considered together with the absorption procedures used in rendering both goat and rabbit antisera specific, the isotypic determinants would appear to reside on the

Fc. Isotypic determinants on immunoglobulins are typically associated with their Fcs. The absence of physical chemical data on this isotype in this preliminary report stems from our current inability to isolate this antibody isotype free of either IgG2a or IgG1. This isotype, "IgG2b", has no unique ion-exchange or Protein-A binding behavior (Fig. 2). Data we present in Table 1 and Fig. 5 indicate it can bind antigen, i.e. function as an antibody. Mammalian serum proteins circa 160 kDa which can bind antigen, are almost always immunoglobulin with specificity for antigens. We have tentatively assigned the name "IgG2b" to this antigen-binding "233 antigen". The assignment of the name IgG2b, was done for the following reasons: (a) antibodies which recognize it are typically present as contaminants in reagents prepared against IgG2, (b) it does not possess the A1 or A2 allotypes which by definition, are a feature of the IgG2a isotype, and (c) there is precedent in the literature for use of the names IgG2a and IgG2b for cattle immunoglobulins as well as in other species, and we have chosen not to disturb the existing nomenclature in lieu of more detailed study. Very probably, IgG2b could also be called IgG3. In any case, we make no strong argument for nomenclature in this report, but as such should rest on sequence and genetic data that are currently unavailable. The elution of IgG2b from DEAE-Sephadex (Figs. 2, 3) superficially resembles the pattern originally described by Kickh6fen et al. [6]. However, these investigators refer to the entire second peak (Fig. 3) as IgG2b (formerly IgG1). We show and have previously shown [11, 14] that the major protein in this second fraction (Fig. 3) or the shoulder of the IgGl-enriched peak which is its equivalent (Fig. 2) is not IgG2b, but rather IgG2a. We have been unable to identify an ion-exchange fraction which is primarily IgG2b. Hence, the designation of ion-exchange fractions as subclasses, when working with cattle, should be avoided. The behavior of IgG2b on Protein-A Trisacryl was unrewarding. Protein-A binds so poorly to bovine IgGs that any small differences in binding of the subclasses could always be contested by Mass Law arguments, competition, etc. While it is true that IgG2a binds somewhat better than IgG1, no sharp distinction into subclasses can be made using this method unless extremely minute quantities are used. When

e.g., large differences in the ratio of IgG1 to IgG2a occur, differentiation by this method is impossible. The data presented in Table 1 show that IgG2b antibody activity is not correlated with that of IgG2a or IgG1 to the same antigens and that IgG2b activity is not preferentially associated with the expression of the A-allotype of IgG2a. Hence, IgG2b shows no tendency which might suggest it is a third allele at the a-locus, or that its expression is linked to that of IgG2a or IgG1. Genetic data suggest that only two A-alleles exist [13]. The occurrence of the IgG2b antigen in all cattle tested by ID, and in every animal tested regardless of allotype (Fig. 3, right; Table l) supports the conclusion that IgG2b is an isotype, not an allotype. The final characterization of IgG2b will rest on the identification of the heavy chain gene and on the biochemistry and immunobiology of the isolated protein.
