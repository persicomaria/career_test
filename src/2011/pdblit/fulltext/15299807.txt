Abstract

The X-ray structure of bovine ribonuclease A cocrystallized with the dinucleotide deoxycytidylyl-3',5'-guanosine has been determined at 1.9 A resolution and refined by restrained least squares to R = 0 . 2 1 8 for 7807 reflections. The structure established that the recently observed retrobound mode of attachment of substrate analogues cytidylyl-2',5'-guanosine and deoxycytidylyl3',5'-guanosine found in soaked RNase A crystals is also present in the cocrystallized complex. Retrobinding is thus unlikely to be the result of restrictions imposed by the crystalline environment as the ligands soak into the lattice but rather a phenomenon specific to small nucleotides containing guanine.

Introduction

Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A; E.C. 3.1.27.5) is one of the most intensively studied enzymes (see for example the review of Blackburn & Moore, 1982). Its two-step catalytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of ribonucleotides is understood in some detail (Richards et al., 1971; Richards & Wyckoff, 1973; Wodak, Liu & Wyckoff, 1977; Pavlovsky, Borisova, Borisov, Antonov & Karpeisky, 1978). Recently, a novel form of nucleotide binding to RNase has been observed in high-resolution studies of complexes formed with the inhibitors cytidylyl-2',5'-guanosine (2'-5'-CpG) and deoxycytidylyl-3',5'-guanosine (3',5'dCpdG), respectively (Aguilar, Thomas, Moss, Mills & Palmer, 1991; Aguilar, Thomas, Mills, Moss & Palmer, 1992). When these dinucleotide substrate analogues were soaked into RNase crystals they were found to bind in a non-productive spatial disposition with the guanine moiety occupying the site which had previously been identified (Richards, Wyckoff & Allewell, 1970) as involved in the recognition of pyrimidine bases of the

substrate (see Fig. 1). In this retrobinding mode the phosphate group of the inhibitor molecule does not interact with any of the residues associated with the active site of the enzyme: His 12, His 119, Lys41 or Glu 11 (see for example, Lisgarten et al., 1993). Instead, the phosphate protrudes into the intermolecular solvent region, pointing directly away from both the active site and the pyrimidine base binding site occupied by Thr45. The guanine base of the retrobound inhibitors 2',5'-CpG and 3',5'-dCpdG forms a perfect hydrogen-bonded fit with Thr45, the side chain normally involved in the productive pyrimidine base-recognition mechanism of RNaseA, a bound solvent SO ] - anion and a bound water molecule, and thus forms a very stable complex occupying the pyrimidine base binding site. From the guanine base onwards the dinucleotide moieties form fewer interactions with the protein and consequently become progressively disordered. Mechanically, RNase cleaves single-sU'anded RNA at the 3' end of pyrimidine nucleosides, highly specifically, Thr45 being responsible for anchoring the base in position during this process. It is difficult to reconcile the perfect fit of the guanine base in the Thr45 pyrimidinebase binding site which is observed in retrobinding with the notion that it is fortuitous. If there is any biological significance for retrobinding it is possibly a mechanism whereby a distant part of a substrate RNA molecule is constrained while undergoing enzymatic cleavage by a neighbouring RNase molecule. However, since the two dinucleotide complexes studied previously by Aguilar et al. (1992) were formed by soaking pre-grown native monoclinic crystals in the inhibitor solutions, it is conceivable that retrobinding is brought about by serendipitous juxtapositioning of the guanine base in the

Thr45 pocket as the inhibitor molecules infiltrate through
the crystal solvent channels. As shown recently by Lisgarten et al. (1993) the smaller mononucleotide inhibitor 2'-CMP does bind productively with RNase in soaked crystal complexes. It is known however that diand trinucleotides damage the crystals during soaking experiments, and this effect may be caused by disruption of existing solvent-channel structures (Perry, 1987).

Full details of the crystallization procedure have been published elsewhere (Mills et al., 1992). The cocrystals are monoclinic with unit-cell dimensions a = 30.47 (7), b = 38.72 (7), c = 53.68 (8),~, fl = 106.3(2) °, P21, Z = 2 and are isomorphous with the native P21 form. A suitable crystal for diffractometry was mounted in a capillary tube with its monoclinic b axis parallel to the length of the tube. Using only one crystal of the complex, X-ray intensity data

J. N. LISGARTEN, D. MAES, L. WYNS, C. F. AGUILAR AND R. A. PALMER were collected by FAST diffractometery (Arndt, 1985) to 1.9,~ resolution using the M A D N E S software (Messerschmidt & Pflugrath, 1987). The crystal orientation was refined prior to and during data collection, allowing reflections to be integrated and Lp corrected online. Datacollection details are given in Table l(a). Merging of equivalents was performed with the Fox & Holmes (1966) algorithm by dividing the data into 5 ° batches on the scan angle (o9), analogous to using separate films in the photographic method. The resulting measured structure-factor amplitudes IFpiI, were combined with IFcl values derived from native ribonuclease A coordinates (Borkakoti, Moss & Palmer, 1982; Borkakoti, Palmer, Haneef & Moss, 1983). Luzzati-weighted coefficients (2mlFpi I - D IFc I) (Read, 1986) were prepared by the program S I M W T (Tickle, 1988), which also performs the derivative-tonative scaling. Prior to calculating difference electrondensity maps, all solvent water molecules and the protein side chains Lys7, Lys41, Hisl2, Hisll9, Phel20 and Thr45, in the vicinity of the active site and known to be highly labile, were removed from the native atom coordinate data set. The solvent and active-site residues were subsequently remodelled and refined. Difference Fouriers were calculated by the program F F T (Ten Eyck,

769

1973) and displayed using F R O D O (Jones, 1978) on an Evans & Sutherland PS390 raster graphics terminal. The initial maps allowed the inhibitor structutre to be built in prior to least-squares refinement, which was performed with the program R E S T R A I N (Haneef, Moss, Stanford & Borkakoti, 1985) using Vax and Convex computers. The structure of the RNase-inhibitor complex was subjected to several rounds of rebuilding and restrained least squares. A total of 59 solvent water molecules were modelled from the electron density and successfully included in the refinement. The results of the refinement procedure are given in Table l(b). The geometrical restraints libraries used by F R O D O and R E S T R A I N were extended to accommodate the geometrical features of the inhibitor molecule.

For example, in the native structure His119 is disordered in two sites, A (80%) and B (20%) (Borkakoti et al., 1982, 1983), whereas in the RNaseA3',5'-dCpdG complex it exists in a conformation close to native His119A with no occupancy for His119B.

Comparison of the native monoclinic RNaseA structure with the soaked 3',5'-dCpdG inhibitor structure and the cocrystallized 3',5'-dCpdG A detailed comparison of the refined monoclinic RNase structures, native (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank citation p3m3.brk, Bernstein et al., 1977), soaked 3',5'dCpdG (p3rn3.brk) and cocrystallized 3',5'-dCpdG (dcpdg-jl.brk) was performed using the program PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski, 1994). This revealed no substantial changes in the structures other than discussed above. Comparison of the main-chain conformations summarized in the three-way ensemble Ramachandran plot given in Fig. 4 (with statistics in Table 4) shows the close correspondence of the three structures. R.m.s. deviations of the atomic coordinates of the three structures are included in Table 3. Details of the water structures of the native and soaked 3',5'-dCpdG complex structures have been discussed by Aguilar et al. (1991) and Aguilar (1991). No significant differences in the water structures of the soaked and cocrystallized 3',5'dCpdG complex structures were observed.

Inspection of Fig. 2 clearly shows the guanine base retrobound at the B 1 site, hydrogen bonded to Thr45 and to the sulfate/phosphate anion which has remained undisplaced between Hisl2 and Hisll9, the remainder of the dinucleotide displaying increasing disorder as the cytidylyl moiety extends across the solvent channel to an adjacent protein molecule. This was also found to occur in pre-soaked native RNaseA crystals containing guanine substrate analogues 2',5'-CpG; 3',5'-dCpdG (Aguilar et al., 1991; Aguilar et al., 1992) and 8-oxo-guanosine-2'phosphate (O8-2'GMP) (Thomas, 1992), but not in similarly treated crystals containing the modified cytidylyl monophosphate bases cytidine N(3)-oxide-2-phosphate (N30-CMP) (Palmer, Moss, Haneef & Borkakoti, 1984) and cytidine-2'-monophosphate (2'-CMP) (Howlin, Harris, Moss & Palmer, 1987; Lisgarten et al., 1993). Inspection of Fig. 3 reveals a marked similarity between the active-site regions of the cocrystallized RNaseA-3',5'-dCpdG complex and the soaked RNaseA3',5'-dCpdG complex. Table 2 parts (a) and (b) giving the active-site inhibitor-protein close contacts and torsion angles, for both complexes also serve to establish the close geometrical similarity between soaked and cocrystallized structures. The only significant difference between the two structures appears to be a repositioning

Concluding remarks The observations reported here suggest that retrobinding to RNase is a phenomenon that occurs in complexes with mono- and dinucleotides containing guanine. Further, the results of the present investigation establish unequivocally that retrobinding can occur in complexes obtained by cocrystallization. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that this mode of binding is not a phenomenon associated exclusively with the process of soaking RNase crystals with inhibitor solutions but is probably a function of some recognition mechanism as yet to be fully characterized.* Dr D.
