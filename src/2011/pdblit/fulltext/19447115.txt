Abstract Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a phylogenetically ancient mitochondrial intermembrane flavoprotein endowed with the unique capacity to induce caspase-independent peripheral chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA fragmentation when added to purified nuclei. In addition to its apoptogenic activity on nuclei, AIF can also participate in the regulation of apoptotic mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and exhibits an NADH oxidase activity. Under normal circumstances, AIF is secluded behind the outer mitochondrial membrane. However, upon apoptosis induction AIF translocates to the cytosol and the nucleus. Injection of anti-AIF antibodies or knockout of the AIF gene have demonstrated that AIF may be required for cell death occurring in response to some stimuli. In particular, inactivation of AIF renders embryonic stem cells resistant to cell death following growth factor withdrawal. Moreover, AIF is essential for programmed cell death during cavitation of embryoid bodies, the very first wave of (caspase-independent) cell death indispensable for mouse morphogenesis. We have recently found that AIF is neutralized by heat-shock protein (HSP) 70, in a reaction that appears to be independent of ATP or the ATP-binding domain (ABD) of HSP70 and thus differs from the previously described Apaf-1/HSP70 interaction (which requires ATP and the HSP70 ABD). Intriguingly, HSP70 lacking ABD (HSP70ABD) inhibits apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal, staurosporin, and menadione, three models of apoptosis which are also affected by micro-injection of anti-AIF antibody or genetic ablation of AIF. Altogether, these data suggest that AIF plays a role in the regulation of caspase-independent cell death. © 2002 Société française de biochimie et biologie moléculaire / Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

1. Introduction In 1994, we observed that the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (m) dropped early during the apoptotic process [1,2]. Intrigued by this observation, we decided to develop a cell-free system in which purified mitochondria were confronted with nuclei from healthy cells to establish the conditions in which chromatin condensation occurred [3­5]. We found that when mitochondria and nuclei were incubated together in a buffer mimicking the ion composi-

tion of the cytosol, nuclei underwent chromatin condensation and DNA loss, provided that agents causing permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes were added into the system. We soon realized that the factor responsible for nuclear chromatinolysis was a soluble protein normally contained in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. We developed a simple test to quantitate this activity, which we baptized `apoptosis-inducing factor' (AIF), based on the cytofluorometric determination of the DNA content of purified nuclei exposed to AIF-containing preparations [6­8]. AIF was progressively purified [4,9], subjected to mass spectroscopy, found to correspond to a peptide contained in an expressed sequence tag (EST), and the mouse and human AIF cDNAs were cloned [9]. We generated recombinant AIF proteins as well as anti-AIF antibodies, which allowed us to furnish the formal proof that AIF provides a biochemical link between the apoptosis- associ-

Fig. 1. Three dissociable functions of AIF. First, AIF is an NADH oxidase. This effect does not require any particular co-factor apart from the electron donor (NADH) and the electron acceptor (e.g. molecular oxygen). It does depend though on the presence of the proshethic FAD group, required for catalytic electron transfer. Second, AIF may permeabilize mitochondrial membranes in a cell-free system, with the concourse of a heat-labile cytosolic effector. At present, it is not known whether this function depends on the AIF redox activity. Third, AIF acts on purified nuclei in a cell-free, cytosol-free system that does not rely on the AIF redox activity. Rather, this system involves a heat-sensitive sessile nuclear protein.

ated mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the nuclear signs of apoptosis [9]. This review will focus on the current state of the knowledge on AIF (Fig. 1).

2. The AIF protein and gene Mouse AIF (612 amino acids) and human AIF (613 amino acids) [9] are strongly homologous exhibiting 92% amino acid identity in the whole protein. Mouse AIF is organized in three domains--(i) an amino-terminal mitochondrial localization sequence (MLS) of 100 amino acids; (ii) a spacer sequence of 27 amino acids; and (iii) a carboxyterminal 485 amino acid oxidoreductase domain with strong homology to oxidoreductases from other vertebrates (Xenopus laevis), non-vertebrate animals (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster), plants, fungi, eubacteria, and archaebacteria [10]. Among eukaryotic proteins with known enzymatic function, the strongest homology with AIF was found for plant semidehydroascorbate and ascorbate reductases, which are flavoproteins [10]. Functionally important amino acids involved in the interaction with the prosthetic group (flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)) are strongly conserved between AIF and bacterial NADH oxidoreductases [10]. AIF purified from mouse liver mitochondria was found to be an FAD-binding protein. Recombinant AIF precursor protein (amino acids 1-612) does not spontaneously incorporate FAD when purified from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli. However, it can be refolded in vitro, in the presence of

FAD, resulting into stable FAD binding. In contrast, recombinant AIF proteins lacking the MLS (AIF 1-100) or the MLS and part of the spacer region (AIF 1-120) spontaneously incorporate FAD when expressed in E. coli [9]. These data, as well as the observation that the N-terminus of mature AIF contained in mitochondria starts at amino acid 101 [9], suggest the following scenario for the biogenesis of AIF. The AIF precursor encoded by a nuclear gene is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then imported into mitochondria through the general import pathway [9]. Once, in the intermembrane space, the MLS of AIF is proteolytically removed and the protein refolds while incorporating FAD, yielding the mature AIF protein. The AIF protein appears to be ubiquitously expressed, throughout embryonic development as well as in adults, confined to mitochondria [11,12]. The AIF gene is localized within mouse X chromosome region A6, which is syntenic to the human X chromosome region Xq25­26 [11]. The AIF gene is composed of a total of 17 exons. RT­PCR cloning using primers for the extreme 5' and 3'-termini of the AIF coding sequence yielded an AIF cDNA species (AIF­exB) [13] that differed from the original AIF sequence [9]. These results, which were originally obtained with the murine AIF gene, were confirmed for human AIF, yielding two very similar sequence variants [13]. Alternative exon usage affects part of the 100 amino acid N-terminal MLS. Both exons possessed significant homology in their C-terminal moiety. When GFP was fused to the C-terminus of AIF (AIF­GFP) or AIF­exB (AIF­exB­GFP) to generate chimeric proteins, transient transfection of COS cells revealed that the GFP-dependent fluorescence

was targeted to mitochondria [13]. These observations indicate that the alternative exon 2 usage does not affect the mitochondrial import of AIF and it may be expected that mature AIF arising from canonical AIF cDNA or AIF­exB would be the same protein. Thus, the functional impact of such variants remains to be defined.

domain (1-351, 155-612, 538-612) abolished the apoptogenic potential of AIF in the cell-free system [9], indicating that at least some of the structural features of the oxidoreductase domain are important for the apoptogenic effect of AIF [9].

4. AIF effects in intact cells 3. AIF effects in cell-free systems Recombinant AIF (AIF 1-120) is endowed with several biochemical activities in vitro. When added to purified nuclei, AIF causes peripheral chromatin condensation as well as large-scale DNA degradation to fragments of 50 kbp, yet fails to cause oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation [9,14]. These effects are obtained in the absence of cytosol. However, AIF has no effect on pre-heated nuclei (56 °C, 30 min) or on naked plasmid DNA, suggesting that the effects of AIF on purified nuclei rely on the functional (and probably physical) interaction with a yet-to-beidentified nuclear protein. In addition to its effects on isolated nuclei, AIF may affect purified mitochondria. Thus, mitochondria exposed to recombinant AIF, in the presence of cytosolic extracts, undergo membrane permeabilization and release cytochrome c as well as other proteins such as pro-caspase-9 through the outer mitochondrial membrane. This reaction is abolished by mild heat treatment of the cytosolic extract (70 °C, 30 min), suggesting that it involves the concourse of a heat-labile cytosolic co-factor [9]. In accord with its flavoprotein structure, AIF has an oxidoreductase function [15]. Natural AIF purified from mitochondria and recombinant AIF purified from bacteria (AIF 1-120) exhibits NADH oxidase activity and can generate superoxide anion (O2­) upon addition of NADH or NADPH. AIF has a redox potential of ­308 mV ± 15 mV at pH 7.5. It also exhibits monodehydroascorbate reductase activity and catalyses cytochrome c reduction in the presence of NADH [15]. ApoAIF 1-120, which lacks FAD, has no NADH oxidase activity. However, native AIF 1-120, apoAIF 1-120, and the reconstituted (FAD-containing) holoAIF 1-120 protein exhibit a similar apoptosis-inducing potential when microinjected into the cytoplasm of intact cells [15]. Inhibition of the redox function, by external addition of superoxide dismutase [15], covalent derivatization of FAD with diphenyleneiodonium [13,15], or mutation of putative FAD-binding residues [13], failed to affect the apoptogenic function of AIF1-120 assessed on purified nuclei in a cell-free system. Conversely, blockade of the apoptogenic function of AIF 1-120 with the thiol reagent para-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid did not affect its NADH oxidase activity [15]. Altogether, these data indicate that AIF has an oxidoreductase activity which can be dissociated from its apoptosis-inducing function. However, deletion mutations affecting parts of the oxidoreductase Two manipulations have been performed to introduce AIF into cells, to an ectopic (extramitochondrial) localization. One possibility consists in using purified or recombinant AIF protein which can be incorporated into cells, either by electroporation [4] or by microinjection [9]. Such a manipulation causes the rapid (within less than 3 h) manifestation of signs of apoptosis. AIF causes nuclear chromatin condensation [9,13,14,16]. Moreover, AIF affects mitochondria, leading to a drop in the m [9,14,16] and triggers the release of cytochrome c as shown by immunofluorescence stainings [16]. When cells are transfected with suitable AIF­GFP or cytochrome c­GFP fusion constructs targeted to mitochondria, microinjection of recombinant AIF rapidly triggers the release of either AIF­GFP or cytochrome c­GFP [13], suggesting that AIF, once present in the cytosol, can trigger the release of further AIF from mitochondria and thus engages in as positive feedback amplification loop. Another method of introducing AIF into cells is transfection-enforced overexpression with either wild-type (full length) AIF or a version of AIF from which the MLS has been removed (AIF 1-100). Fusion of GFP to the C-terminus of AIF (yielding AIF­GFP) or AIF1-100 (AIF 1-100-GFP) allows for continuous monitoring of the subcellular localization of such proteins. AIF­GFP initially localizes to mitochondria and later, presumably due to local toxic effects, translocates to the cytosol and to the nucleus, thereby causing apoptosis [9,13]. Apoptosis induced by AIF­GFP can be further postponed by overexpression of Bcl-2, which apparently withholds AIF in mitochondria [13]. In contrast, transfection with AIF 1-100-GFP results into a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution of GFP, comparable to that obtained with GFP alone [13,17]. Transfection with AIF 1-100 or AIF 1-100-GFP causes accelerated cell death (as compared to full-length AIF cDNA or AIF­GFP) [13,17,18], in accord with the idea that ectopic (extramitochondrial) AIF fulfils an apoptogenic function while eutopic (mitochondrial) AIF would be relatively innocuous. Of note, apoptosis induced by orthotopic overexpression of full-length AIF cDAN is inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2, provided that Bcl-2 is targeted to mitochondria rather than to the endoplasmic reticulum [13]. In sharp contrast, we observed that none of the apoptogenic effects of ectopic (extramitochondrial) AIFs are prevented by overexpression of Bcl-2 [4,9,13]. The effects of AIF transfection or microinjection are not inhibited by pharmacological caspase

inhibitors [9, 13,16]. Moreover, AIF microinjection has similar consequences in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and MEF lacking the caspase activator Apaf-1 or caspase-3 [14], underscoring that AIF acts in a caspaseindependent fashion.

6. Ablation of AIF at the functional or genetic levels The AIF antibody that we generated (raised against amino acids 151­200) inhibits the effect of microinjected AIF [9,16] (Table 2). Microinjection of the anti-AIF antibody also prevents chromatin condensation in staurosporintreated Rat-1 cells [9] or in syncytia elicited by the interaction between HIV-1-Env and CD4 [16]. In this latter model, anti-AIF also prevents the dissipation of the m and the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c [16], suggesting that AIF may be rate-limiting for mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Control experiments performed by microinjecting pre-immune sera or anti-AIF neutralized by an excess amount of the immunogenic AIF-derived peptide yielded negative results [9,16], thus underscoring that the effects of anti-AIF can be attributed to its capacity to neutralize AIF in the microinjected cell. Recently, the knockout of the AIF gene (performed in male cells leading to an aif­/Y genotype) has refined our knowledge on the contribution of AIF to apoptosis. Unlike cytochrome c­/­, apaf1­/­ and caspase-9­/­ ES cells [28­30] aif­/Y ES cell lines displayed normal susceptibility to death induced by staurosporine, etoposide, azide, tertbutylhydroperoxide, anisomycin, or UV-irradiation. This normal susceptibility to cell death induction was observed both in the absence and in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk. In strict contrast, aif­/Y ES cells were resistant to cell death following serum withdrawal. Thus, at difference with aif +/Ycontrols, aif­/Y ES cell lines largely conserved their viability and a normal m when cultured for three days in the absence of serum. Moreover, in the presence of Z-VAD.fmk (but not in its absence), aif­/Y ES cell lines failed to die in response to the pro-apoptotic agent vitamin K3 (menadione) (Table 2). More importantly, we found that AIF was essential for cavitation, a phenomenon that constitutes the result of the first wave of apoptotic cell death during embryogenesis [31]. In the absence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and feeder cells, ES cells form simple embryoid bodies (EBs) defined as multicellular aggregates of a single-cell type. Simple EBs then differentiate into complex EBs, which display an outer layer of endodermal cells and a condensed inner core of ectodermal cells. The inner mass cells (endoblasts) of complex EBs subsequently undergo apoptosis to form fully cystic EBs, a process called cavitation. When ­/Y aif ES cells were tested in the EB formation assay, they were able to form simple and complex EBs at frequencies and with kinetics that were comparable to those of aif+/Y and aifNeo/Y controls. However, whereas a significant proportion of aif +/Y and aifNeo/Y EBs underwent cavitation to form fully cystic EBs, EBs from differentiated aif­/Y ES cell lines exhibited a complete block in cavitation [12]. Cavitation was normal in aif +/Y EBs maintained in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk. It was also normal in EBs generated from apaf1­/­ and caspase-9­/­ ES cells [12].

5. Mitochondrio-nuclear translocation of AIF in cells and in whole organisms When cells are induced to undergo apoptosis, AIF translocates from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol, as well as to the nucleus. This observation has been validated using all available methods for the determination of the subcellular localization of AIF: in situ immunostaining, transfection with AIF­GFP, and subcellular fractionation. Translocation of AIF has been observed in numerous models of apoptosis induced in cell cultures (Table 1), including in models in which caspase activation is precluded due to addition of pharmacological inhibitors or invalidation of caspase-activatory proteins (e.g. Apaf-1) or caspase-3. In many instances, translocation of AIF was correlated with a (caspase-independent) peripheral type of chromatin condensation [4,13,14,19,20]. Moreover, the translocation of AIF has been confirmed in cell death occurring in vivo, in models of retinal degeneration [21], brain damage induced by hypoglycaemia or ischaemia, or myocard infarction (unpublished observations). AIF release from mitochondria appears to be universally associated with cell death. What are then the general rules that apply to the mitochondrio-nuclear translocation of AIF? In several models of apoptosis induction, the release of AIF from mitochondria precedes that of cytochrome c. This applies to staurosporin-induced apoptosis [9,19], apoptosis induced by infection with HIV-1 [16,22], or apoptosis triggered by fusion of cells expressing the HIV-1 envelope [Env] glycoprotein complex with cells expressing CD4 [16,23]. How AIF can be released from mitochondria before cytochrome c is not clear. The local presence of Bcl-2 in mitochondrial membranes inhibits the release of both AIF [9,19] and cytochrome c [24,25], presumably by stabilizing the barrier function of mitochondrial membranes [4,26,27]. Once released from mitochondria, AIF moves to the nucleus [9,16,19]. Nuclear apoptosis induced by microinjected AIF is inhibited by co-microinjection of the lectin wheat-germ agglutinin. Blockade of the lectin moiety by N-acetylglucosamine abolishes the wheat-germ-agglutininmediated inhibition of AIF-induced nuclear apoptosis [9]. This observation suggests that AIF would be imported into nuclei via an active, energy-demanding process. However, AIF also translocates to the nucleus in conditions of ATP depletion [19] and may be expected to interact with DNA in a non-specific fashion due to its basic pI [15]. The exact rules governing the nuclear relocalization of AIF thus remain to be established.

Considering that cavitation is essential for the initiation of gastrulation and thus subsequent steps in embryogenesis, these observations are in line with the fact that no viable mouse embryos could be generated from aif­/Y ES cells [12], whereas apaf1­/­ and caspase-9­/­ mice are viable until birth, although affected by severe developmental defects, in particular in the central nervous system [28,29,32]. Cytochrome c was found to be released from mitochondria of

WT, apaf1­/­, and caspase-9­/­ inner mass cells undergoing cavitation-associated cell death. However, there was no detectable cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to the cytosol in inner mass cells of aif­/Y EBs [12], indicating that the outer mitochondrial membrane failed to permeabilize. These findings indicate that during cavitation AIF acts upstream of cytochrome c and independently of the cytochrome c/Apaf1-triggered caspase activation cascade.

Altogether, these findings indicate that AIF can function as a true regulator of cell death, at least in some paradigms.

7. HSP70: an endogenous inhibitor of AIF AIF is a phylogenetically ancient protein [10], and it controls the first wave of cell death during early embyogenesis [12], in line with the commonplace that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. We, therefore, reasoned that ancestral cytoprotective proteins such as heat-shock proteins (HSPs) might function as AIF inhibitors. Using a series of biochemical tests, we discovered that, among a panel of different HSPs (HSP10, 27, 60, 70, 90), HSP70 was the sole protein to physically interact with AIF [18]. In a cell-free system, HSP70 prevented the AIF-induced chromatin condensation of purified nuclei. Cells overexpressing HSP70 were protected against the apoptogenic effects of AIF targeted to the extramitochondrial compartment, either by microinjection of the recombinant AIF protein or by transfection with AIF 1-100 [18]. These protective effects were observed both at the nuclear and at the mitochondrial levels. An antisense HSP70cDNA, which reduced the expression of endogenous HSP70, sensitized to the lethal effect of AIF, suggesting that near-to-physiological levels of HSP70 may modulate the response to AIF [18]. HSP70 has previously been reported to block apoptosis by binding Apaf-1, thereby preventing the constitution of the apoptosome, the Apaf-1/cytochrome c/caspase-9 activation complex [33­35]. Is HSP70 then antiapoptotic due to its capacity to prevent (Apaf-1-dependent) caspase activation? Intriguingly, HSP70 may prevent cell death in conditions in which caspase activation does not occur due to the addition of exogenous caspase inhibitors [36]. Moreover, we found that overexpression of HSP70 protects apaf1­/­ cells from cell death induced by serum withdrawal [18], indicating that Apaf-1 is not the sole target of the cytoprotective action of HSP70. A more detailed picture on the anti-Apaf-1 and the anti-AIF activities of HSP70 emerged when we characterized the structural features of HSP70

required for its interaction with Apaf-1 and AIF. As other chaperones, HSP70 possesses a docking site for interaction with a substrate (peptide-binding domain, PBD), as well as an ATP-binding domain (ABD), both of which are required for the protein-refolding (foldase) activity of HSP70. The in vitro interaction of HSP70 and Apaf-1 has been found to rely on ATP hydrolysis [33]. Accordingly, HSP70ABD fails to co-immunoprecipitate with Apaf-1 [18] and fails to prevent (presumably Apaf-1- and caspase-dependent [28]) cell death induced by etoposide, cis-platin, or doxorubicin [18]. In strict contrast, HSP70ABD does interact with AIF [18] and can protect cells against AIF overexpression, serum withdrawal, menadione, staurosporine [18], UV irradiation [37], or thermal stress [38]. This is in line with the observations that AIF is rate-limiting for apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal, menadione [12], and staurosporine [9]. Altogether, these data indicate that AIF is neutralized by HSP70, in a reaction that does not imply the (ATP- and ABD-dependent) foldase activity of HSP70. Whether this interaction accounts for the strong antiapoptotic [35] and oncogenic [39,40] potential of HSP70 remains to be clarified.

8. Open conundra Research on apoptosis has been heavily overshadowed by the notion that caspases would be the key effectors of the lethal process. It has become increasingly clear, however, that pharmacological inhibition or genetic invalidation of caspase activation pathways frequently (mostly?) fails to confer true cytoprotection against environmental insults, pathogenic cell death inducers or even developmentally regulated cellular demise in mammals. Cell death in fungi or plants is unlikely to involve caspases since they have not yet been discovered. AIF may be one of the caspaseindependent, phylogenetically old death effectors, and it will be important to address a number of incognita in the near future. What is the role of the AIF homologues in cell

death of plants and fungi? What is the normal function of AIF as a mitochondrion-based oxidoreductase? Which precise pathways of cell death induction do rely on AIF in mammals? What are the nuclear and cytosolic targets of AIF? How is it possible that AIF acts, in some pathways, upstream of cytochrome c release? Are there posttranslational (post-mitochondrial) modifications of AIF that might influence its apoptogenic potential? Are there other functional AIF inhibitors than HSP70? What is the functional link between AIF and other proteins which trigger chromatin degradation such as caspase-activated DNAse (CAD), endonuclease-G, or cyclophilins? And last but not least, is it possible to generate small AIF-inhibitory or AIF-activatory molecules that may be useful for the therapeutic prevention or induction of cell death?
