Abstract: Solution NMR spin-relaxation experiments were used to compare µs-ms dynamics in RNase A in the apo form and as complexed to the substrate-mimic, pTppAp. The crystal structure of the RNase A/pTppAp complex was determined and demonstrates that this ligand binds at the active site and utilizes established substrate binding sites in its interaction with RNase A. Relaxation-compensated CPMG experiments identify flexible residues in and around the active site in both the apo and pTppAp-bound enzyme. Quantitative analysis of the NMR spin-relaxation dispersion curves show that the time scale of motion in RNase A is unchanged when pTppAp binds and is similar to the time scale for the rate-determining step of the catalytic reaction. Temperature-dependent measurements provide an activation barrier for motion of 5.2 ( 1.0 kcal/mol and 4.5 ( 1.2 kcal/mol for the apo and pTppAp forms of RNase A, respectively. These data indicate very similar motion exists in the free and bound enzyme. Additionally, chemical shift data suggests that the magnitude of motion is also similar for these two forms and that it is likely that apo enzyme interconverts to a structure that resembles a ligand-bound form. Likewise, it appears that the bound conformation samples the apo enzyme form even when ligand is present. Taken together the data imply that RNase A is in a preexisting dynamic equilibrium between two conformations that represent the open and closed enzyme forms. These data suggest that ligand binding stabilizes the bound conformer but does not induce it.

Introduction

Enzymes undergo conformational fluctuations that span a wide range of time scales. Although it has been established that such motions exist, the role of these motions in the catalytic process is only partially understood. The binding of substrate, substrate analogues, and transition-state analogues often results in conformational changes. This conformational flexibility is essential to the catalytic process as it allows optimal orientation of catalytic residues1 and provides a suitable environment for the desired reaction.2 There is also evidence that the inherent flexibility present in enzymes allows sampling of ligand-bound conformations even in the absence of ligand.3 In these cases, binding serves to stabilize the active conformer, thereby resulting in a population shift toward the active (bound) form. An understanding of this process can be gleaned from a comparison of the kinetics and energetics of enzyme mobility in the apo and ligand-bound states.4,5 Thus, characterization of protein motion in different ligation states resembling positions along

the catalytic reaction coordinate can provide insight into motions that are essential for aspects of catalysis. Herein we describe the continuation of our efforts to explore the role of flexibility in enzyme function by studying the dynamics of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A). An advantage to the study of RNase A is the availability of data regarding the structure and kinetics of this enzyme. RNase A is a highly stable protein enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of the P-O5 bond in single-stranded RNA. The active site of the enzyme resides within a deep cleft in the enzyme, and interactions between the enzyme and substrate occur within specific subsites.6-9 Two subsites, B1 and B2, interact with the nitrogen-containing functional groups of the substrate. The B1 subsite is specific for binding a pyrimidine that is 5 to the scissile phosphate. Important B1 subsite residues are Thr 45 and Asp 83. The B2 subsite binds the purine base of the nucleotide, 3 to the cleavage position. This site has a preference for binding adenine, and key residues at this site include Asn 71 and Glu 111. Three phosphate-binding subsites have also been identified in RNase A. The P0 subsite interacts with the 5 phosphate of the pyrimidine nucleotide and includes Lys 66.

Kinetics of pTppAp Binding to RNase A. The interaction of pTppAp with RNase A was studied by NMR line shape analysis. The Bloch-McConnell equations describe the chemical exchange contribution to the NMR line shape.18 Under steady-state conditions for a case of n chemically exchanging sites:

The P1 subsite interacts with the phosphate group containing the scissile bond. In addition to Gln 11, Lys 41, and Asp 121, this site also contains the highly conserved, catalytically critical residues His 12 and His 119. The P2 subsite interacts with the 3 phosphate of the purine nucleotide and is composed of the residues Lys 7 and Arg 10. We sought to exploit all of these interactions between enzyme and substrate in an effort to characterize motions present in a complex resembling the first step of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, namely the enzyme-substrate (E-S) complex. To obtain an effective mimic of the E-S state, the dinucleotide, 5-phosphothymidine (3-5) pyrophosphate adenosine 3phosphate (pTppAp),10 was synthesized to enable the comparison of dynamics present in the free enzyme with the pTppAp/ RNase A complex. The molecule pTppAp meets the established criteria for specific base and phosphate binding sites. The use of this molecule allows effective comparisons of the motion present in the apo state and, as described below, the substratebound state of the enzyme, and affords an opportunity to characterize motions specific for the enzyme/substrate complex. As part of this study, the structure of pTppAp/RNase A has been determined by X-ray crystallography, the kinetics of binding of pTppAp to RNase A have been measured by NMR line shape analysis, and the internal protein motions have been characterized using NMR spin-relaxation experiments.
Methods and Theory
Protein Expression and Purification. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). All buffers and salts were from Aldrich Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Deuterated buffers were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). The plasmid, pBXR, encoding for bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A, was a generous gift of Professor Ronald T. Raines (University of WisconsinMadison). 15N isotopically labeled RNase A was expressed and purified according to published protocols, with the exception that the final growth stage was performed in a modified M9 media.11 The optimized growth media contained 2 g/L 15N NH4Cl and was supplemented by vitamins and trace metals. The purity of the final samples was determined to be >98% using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The concentration of RNase A was assayed spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient, -1 cm-1.12 The synthesis and characterization of pTppAp 278 ) 9800 M was performed as previously reported.10,13,14 NMR Experiments. All protein NMR experiments were performed on a 600 µM sample of 15N labeled RNase A. The solution was buffered with 20 mM perdeuterated MES pH 6.3 and contained 10 mM NaCl. NMR data was acquired on a Varian Inova 600 MHz instrument equipped with a Varian HCN probe with triple-axis gradient capabilities, and a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Varian cryogenic HCN probe with Z-axis gradients. NMR data were processed with NMRPipe15 and visualized with Sparky.16 Relaxation rates were determined as previously described.17 The NMR sample temperature was calibrated for each experiment with 100% methanol.

The dissociation constant for the binding of pTppAp to RNase A has been determined by isothermal titration calorimetry.13 This dissociation constant allows the calculation of concentrations of ligand (L), free enzyme (E), and ligand-bound enzyme (EL) for each point in the ligand titration. Further, since Kd ) kr/kf ) 16 nM,13 only one of the two rate constants needs to be determined by the fitting process. This reduces the fitting problem to a two-dimensional search for kr and the normalization factor c. The kinetics of pTppAp binding to RNase A were measured by titration of pTppAp into a solution of 15N-labeled enzyme. After each titration step, a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was acquired. The titration was performed at both 25 and 15 °C. The NMR data were initially processed with NMRPipe and then converted with in-house scripts for final analysis with MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.). A total of 12 peaks were selected that were well-resolved and showed noticeable changes in peak shape and chemical shift during the titration. The twodimensional peaks were first integrated across the 15N dimension to remove the influence of chemical exchange of the nitrogen atoms on the line shape of the amide proton atoms. The resulting one-dimensional peak shapes for the free enzyme and pTppAp-saturated RNase A were fit to a Lorentzian, after normalization of peak areas, to determine the apparent transverse relaxation rate, R2*, and the resonance frequency of the free and bound states. These data were used to construct the R, K, and  matrices and the vector b. Each of the 10 titration points for p all 12 residues were fit simultaneously using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm20 to determine the required normalization factor, c and the rate for substrate dissociation, kr. Simultaneous fitting is justified because fitting of individual titrations gave similar results (within 10%), suggesting that all report on the same binding process. This overall approach is similar to one recently proposed.21 Quantitation of Chemical Exchange. To quantitate the contribution of µs-ms chemical exchange-type motion, the relaxation-compensated CPMG experiment (rcCPMG) was performed as a function of interpulse

ARTICLES defined by the R ) 0.05 critical value are not considered for further analysis. At this stage, all residues undergoing conformational exchange motion have been identified from step 1, and a subset of these, from step 2, with suitable data quality in their dispersion curves for more detailed analysis has been found. (3) In typical proteins that show exchange motion, there are often several residues experiencing that motion. Therefore, it is of interest to ask whether each residue experiences independent motion or is part of a global motional process in which motional parameters kex and pa are shared among residues unlike  and R20, which are residue specific parameters. To differentiate between a global process and residue-specific motion, the relaxation-dispersion data is fit by eq 3 in which kex and pa are overall fit parameters with a single value and  and R20 are individual, residue-specific fit parameters. Fitting is done using in-house written Perl scripts that generate the Mathematica notebook, which performs the data analysis. The results of this fitting procedure are compared to one in which all four parameters are allowed residue-specific values. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is then used to assess which model (global kex, pa or individual values) is more likely to describe the data.28 In addition, a runs test analysis of the fit residuals is performed to ensure no systematic trend is present. This test checks that the residuals reflect a random distribution at the 95% confidence level. X-ray Crystallography. The pTppAp/RNase A complex was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using PEG4000 as a precipitant. The protein-ligand complex was taken from an NMR sample, which contained 600 µM 15N-labeled RNase A and 20% molar excess of pTppAp, the same used for NMR relaxation experiments. The sample also contained 10% D2O, 10 mM NaCl, 3mM NaN3 and 20 mM MES-d13 at pH 6.3. Within one week rod clusters of pTppAp-bound RNase A crystals appeared above solutions containing between 33.5% (w/v) and 38% (w/v) PEG-4000. These rodlike crystals were used to seed crystals suitable for X-ray analysis, which had a final PEG concentration of 29%. The X-ray diffraction data was acquired on a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer system operating with graphite monochromated Mo KR radiation at a wavelength of 0.71069 Å. The resulting data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK.29 The scaled data were provided as input to the program Crystallography and NMR System (CNS), which was employed for the structure calculation.30 All visualization of enzyme structure and electron density maps was performed with the program O.31

Determination of the microscopic rate constant by measuring R2 as a function of the inter-pulse delay cp is known as dispersion analysis. Transverse spin-relaxation data using the rcCPMG experiment 22 for the apo and pTppAp-saturated enzyme were acquired at 600 and 500 MHz at 283, 293, and 298 K. At each temperature and static magnetic field, relaxation rates (R2(1/cp)) were measured by acquiring twodimensional experiments with interpulse delays, cp in the nitrogen relaxation period of 0.625, 0.714, 1.0, 1.25, 1.67, 2.0, 2.50, 3.33, 5.0, and 10.0 ms. Relaxation rates were measured from a reference experiment with total relaxation time ) 0.0 ms and one with the total relaxation time equal to 40.0 ms.26 The proton carrier frequency was set coincident with the water resonance. The 15N carrier was set to 119 ppm, which is the center of the amide spectral region. Dispersion data for each amino acid residue were analyzed using in-house fitting algorithms written in Mathematica code (Wolfram, Inc) to obtain kex, , pa and R20. The fitting protocol utilizes the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.20 Fitting yields the magnitude of  only. To determine the sign of  for the conformational exchange process, HSQC and HMQC experiments were performed at 600 MHz.27 Protocol for Dispersion Analysis. Because a large amount of spinrelaxation data was collected for free and bound RNase A at multiple static magnetic field strengths and temperatures, a robust statistical based method was needed to determine which residues were to be analyzed and how that analysis was to be done. This procedure consisted of three steps. (1) The first step involved coarse filtering of the data. At each temperature and magnetic field strength, the residues for which R* > 3 s-1, where R* ) (R2[cp ) 10 ms] - R2[cp ) 0.625 ms]) are ex ex chosen for additional analysis. This criterion is based on our experience that R2 values that differ by 3 s-1 over a 10 ms difference in cp represent real differences in relaxation rates, thereby indicating the presence of conformational exchange motion for this residue. The goal at this stage is to pare down the data sets to a manageable size and identify only residues involved in µs-ms motion. (2) To quantitate the motional parameters, 2 analysis of the fits of eq 3 to the individual dispersion data is performed. Residues with 2 values greater than that

The areas where the backbone conformations are noticeably different are the loop regions near Ser 22 and Lys 91 as well as the region near Asn 67 and Lys 66. The -sheet near Asn 67 has moved slightly toward the pTppAp molecule. Stereo figures highlighting the differences in the enzyme structure between the free and bound forms are provided in the Supporting Information. The pTppAp molecule is present in the active site of both protomers in the asymmetric unit. The conformation of the ligand is identical between both molecules of RNase A, and all atoms are well resolved in the electron density map, as seen in Figure 1b. The conformation of the adenosine nucleotide glycosyl torsion angle is syn. The glycosyl torsion angle of the thymidine portion of the ligand is anti. The conformation of the sugar rings for both the adenosine and thymidine portion of pTppAp bound to RNase A is C2endo.

state analogues 3-CMP and pAp. Figure 2c shows a comparison of the bound pTppAp conformation with that of the guanosine portion of the nonproductively bound cytosine (2-5) guanosine. pTppAp binds in the active site of RNase A and is in close contact with functionally important residues. The adenine portion binds in the B2 subsite. The purine base forms an aromatic stack above the imidazole ring of His 119 with the exocyclic amino nitrogen (N6) of adenosine within hydrogen bonding distance with the side chains of Asn 67, Gln 69, and Asn 71. These interactions are similar to those observed with pAp.36 The 3phosphate of the adenine group sits in the P2 subsite with O1 4.0 Å from N of Lys 7. In addition, the side chain N1 atom of His 119 is 3.2 Å from the oxygen that it would protonate as part of the transphosphorylation reaction if pTppAp were a reactive substrate. The catalytic base for the transphosphorylation reaction, His 12, is located near the ribose C2; however, because C2 is deoxy, no reaction occurs with pTppAp. It appears that the majority of interactions expected in the true RNase A/substrate complex are realized in the pTppAp complex, and this complex is distinct from unproductively bound ligands (Figure 2c). Kinetics of pTppAp Binding to RNase A. In previous studies, titration calorimetry was used to characterize the thermodynamics of pTppAp binding to RNaseA.13 Here, line shape fitting of RNase A resonances from a pTppAp titration series was used to characterize ligand binding kinetics. These experiments were performed at 288 and 298 K. The results of these titrations are shown in Figure 3. Fitting each residue to the same set of kinetics parameters provided a good fit in all cases. Fitting to more complex models (e.g., three-site) did not improve the quality of the fits. Fitted parameters are presented in Table 2. Assuming Arrhenius behavior, the activation barrier for ligand release determined from data at these two temperatures is 16.5 ( 1.2 kcal/mol and that for ligand binding is 4.3 ( 3.8 kcal/mol. NMR Spin-Relaxation Experiments. At each temperature, residues in RNase A and RNase A/pTppAp exhibited evidence of conformational exchange broadening as indicated by increases in measured R2 values as cp increases. Based on typical signalto-noise values in our experiments, Rex [R2(10 ms) - R2(0.625 ms)] values > 3 s-1 are considered significant and indicative of µs-ms motion. Using this criterion, apo RNase A contains 25, 43, and 29 residues in conformational exchange at 283, 293, and 298 K, respectively, at 500 and 600 MHz combined. Flexible residues in the apo form agree well with those identified previously;17 the use of two magnetic fields39 in this work allowed a more thorough characterization of the exchange parameters. For the RNase A/pTppAp complex at both magnetic field strengths, the number of exchanging residues is 36, 36, and 23 at 283, 293, and 298 K respectively. These flexible residues are mapped onto the RNase A structure in Figure 4.

Experimental data points are shown in the same color as the fitted line obtained using best fits with eq 1. The curves represent the proton chemical shift dependence and peak intensity at 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2 (blue, red, green, yellow, cyan) equivalents of pTppAp; although the titration consisted of 10 points, only these five are shown for clarity.

In favorable cases, the NMR data were of sufficient quality to allow quantitation of the exchange parameters by fitting eq 3 to the spin-relaxation data (see Methods and Theory). For the apo form at 500 and 600 MHz, seven residues (S16, T17, S22, D83, T100, Q101, and H119) at 283 K, thirteen residues (Q11, S15, S16, T17, N44, F46, A64, K66, N71, D83, T100, Q101, and H119) at 293 K, and nine residues (S16, T17, S22,

N44, K66, N71, D83, T100, and Q101) at 298 K were globally fit to eq 3. In the RNase A/pTppAp complex, the number of residues at each temperature that were fit to eq 3 were 12 (F8, E9, S15, A19, S22, N34, K41, S80, C84, E86, A96, and A122) at 283 K; 10 (Q11, S15, S16, T17, A19, K66, G68, T70, Q101, A122) at 293 K; and 8 (Q11, M13, S16, T17, S22, M30, Q101, and H119) at 298 K. The protocol described in the Methods and Theory was used to determine that a global model in which all residues have the same kex value and equilibrium site populations is appropriate for RNase A in the apo and pTppAp case. In all cases, a conformational exchange model in which kex and pa are global parameters was a better representation of the data than one in which all parameters can assume a residue specific value as determined by comparison of AIC results (Supporting Information). Simultaneous fitting of eq 3 to the spin-relaxation data at both magnetic fields yielded exchange rate constants, kex, of 1080 ( 80 s-1 {930-1240 95% CI} at 283 K, 1390 ( 70 s-1 {1240-1540} at 293 K, and 1750 ( 130 s-1 {1490-2020} at 298 K for apo RNase A and 1316 ( 160 s-1 {990-1640}, 1880 ( 200 s-1 {1490-2272}, and 1920 ( 250 s-1 {1410-2420} for the RNase A/pTppAp complex at 283, 293, and 298 K respectively. Examples of dispersion curves are shown in Figure 5. The exchange rate of the conformational motion process increases with increasing temperature. The value of kex versus temperature is plotted in Figure 6 for the apo and pTppAp forms of RNase A. The variation of ln(kex) vs T-1 was fit with the Arrhenius equation, yielding activation energies for the motional process of 5.2 ( 1.0 and 4.5 ( 1.2 kcal/mol for the apo and pTppAp forms, respectively. In contrast to the temperature dependence of kex there is little overall variation in equilibrium populations with temperature. For the apo form the population of the major conformation ranges from 90 to 93% over the 15° temperature range, whereas in the pTppAp form the population ranges from 90 to 96%. However, in neither case is a discernible trend observed in the temperature dependence of the population. This most likely reflects the uncertainty in fitting for pa in addition to the fact that the populations may simply have a weak dependence on temperature. Fitting spin-relaxation data with eq 3 also provides the magnitude of the chemical shift difference () between exchanging sites. There are eight residues (Q11, S15, S16, T17, S22, K66, Q101, H119) that have quantifiable  values from the global fits of the dispersion data for both forms of RNase A. Figure 7 shows the correlation of  values for the apo and pTppAp forms. The correlation coefficient (R2) is 0.47 if Lys 66 and His 119 are included in the fit and 0.94 and a slope of 0.96 without inclusion of these residues.
Discussion

Many enzymes catalyze reactions that greatly favor formation of product with little or no reverse reaction, and RNase A is included in this group. This irreversibility precludes NMR study of enzyme dynamics during the catalytic cycle for all but a few

This technique has long been used to address mechanistic issues.41,42 Here, we employ this approach to study enzyme dynamics in a substrate-like state using the tight-binding dinucleotide, pTppAp. To verify that pTppAp interacts with RNase A in a manner similar to that predicted for the actual substrate, we solved the

are expected to reflect those occurring when RNase A interacts with substrate. Furthermore, comparison of these motions with motions in the apo enzyme will reveal dynamic processes important for function and those unique to each form of the enzyme. The changes in conformation between the free and pTppAp forms are subtle, yet comparison of X-ray structures of free and ligand-bound RNase A suggests these changes are real and linked to ligand binding. The conformational change is summarized by a reduction in the size of the active-site groove upon binding. The active site is situated between two halves of the enzyme that open and close, thereby changing the shape of the groove. The bottom of the active site plays a role as the hinge in this motion.44 These structural changes that occur upon binding are localized to the loop-1 (residues 14-24) that connects R-helix-1 and R-helix-2. This loop is located at the bottom of the active-site pocket. The other region that experi(43) Aguilar, C. F.; Thomas, P. J.; Moss, D. S.; Mills, A.; Palmer, R. A. Biochim. Biophys.

ences a change in conformation upon ligand binding is loop-4 (residues 64-71), which comprises the B2 subsite. The regions in RNase A that exhibit different free and bound conformations are also the regions of the enzyme that undergo conformational motion, as evidenced by dynamic NMR data. This motion appears to be necessary for optimal binding/release of ligands, which can be understood as follows. RNase A becomes more compact upon binding as the enzyme "tightens" its grip on the ligand.45 Interestingly, the rate-limiting step for RNase A catalysis is not chemical but is instead the product release step.46,47 Several studies have characterized the kinetics of product release in RNase A under solution conditions similar to those used in the current NMR experiments. At 298 K, the off-rate for 3-CMP is 3 × 103 s-1 measured by T-jump experiments,48 and 2 × 103 s-1 for 3-UMP using 31P NMR.49 As stated in other work, the product release step is likely linked to the opening/closing of the active site, which occurs at a rate 103 s-1.50 As would be expected for rate-limiting product release, the value of kcat is the same as that for product dissociation. For the catalytic transphosphorylation of UpA kcat is reported to be 1400-2900 s-1 at pH ) 6.0.11,51 These values match the conformational exchange rate measured here for the free and pTppAp-bound RNase A. It is worth noting that this NMR-observed motion is intramolecular in nature, i.e., not stemming from direct binding or release. This is established by our line shape analysis from pTppAp titrations, which indicates that binding/dissociation of the pTppAp molecule does not contribute to the measured exchange phenomena. In addition, under the equilibrium conditions of the NMR experiments only 0.02% of RNase A is not complexed to pTppAp. Therefore, binding and release dynamics negligibly contribute to the observed relaxation dispersion, indicating that our analysis informs on intramolecular motions only. Thus, we conclude that because pTppAp is a confirmed substrate mimic, this argument safely extends to natural substrates. RNase A/pTppAp conserves the intramolecular motion and inherent flexibility of free RNase A. Furthermore, the time scale of this conserved motion matches the rate-limiting product release step. The activation energy for the conformational change in RNase A and RNase A/pTppAp are identical within the uncertainty of the measurement. The activation barrier for this conformational change is similar to that observed for the product dissociation step of 3-UMP (Eact ) 3.5 kcal/mol).49 These data suggest that RNase A possesses a natural motion of interconversion between two conformations on a time scale of the rate-determining enzymatic step, likely to facilitate product release. The similarity in kex and Eact for the two forms of RNase A suggests a similarity in the type of motion that is occurring. An important remaining question concerns the molecular basis for this motion. A qualitative estimate of the structural alterations as a result of molecular motion can be determined from differences, , in chemical shift between open and closed conformations. We

Figure 8. Determination of the sign of . The sign of  can be determined as shown in (A, B) as described.27 The two scenarios that give rise to positive (A) and negative (B) sign of . The intrinsic resonance position, in the absence of conformational exchange, is shown for the major conformer (red) at A and the minor (blue dashed) conformer at B. In the presence of conformational exchange, the observed resonance in an HSQC experiment is closer to that of the minor, invisible resonance than that of the HMQC peak. Therefore, if the resonance of the major conformer is downfield from that of the minor conformer, the sign of  is positive (for HMQC - HSQC). If the resonance of the major conformer is upfield from that for the minor resonance, then the sign of  is negative (for HMQC - HSQC). In (C) the sign of  for residues in conformational exchange was determined from HMQC and HSQC experiments and is shown in the third and fourth columns of (C). The second column shows the sign of the chemical shift difference, bind, between the apo and pTppAp resonances (for Apo - pTppAp) for the same residues. If, as suggested in this work, the apo enzyme explores the bound conformation, then the signs of columns 2 and 3 would be expected to be the same and that of column 4 should be opposite those of 2 and 3. This is exactly what is observed for the majority of residues with the exception of those highlighted.

determined  for residues that show exchange in both the apo and the pTppAp RNase A forms (Figure 7). There is an excellent linear correlation, with a slope ) 0.96, between the magnitude of  for apo and RNase A/pTppAp; the appropriate sign variation of  has been demonstrated separately (vide infra). This suggests that the two conformations of the interconverting species are similar for the free and bound forms of RNase A. That is, the apo form samples the bound conformation, and likewise the RNase A/pTppAp complex samples the free enzyme conformation (although pTppAp does not dissociate from the enzyme). Several of these residues are located in loop-1 that undergoes a significant conformational change upon ligand binding. These residues are located at the bottom of the active site near the hinge region. An exception to the noted correlation in chemical shift changes is observed for His 119 and Lys 66, both of which are in close proximity to a phosphate group of the bound pTppAp molecule. It is likely that the phosphate perturbs the chemical shift of these residues significantly so that the calculated  value in the bound form incorporates an additional Coulombic effect not at play in the free enzyme.4 The sign of  was determined from two-dimensional HMQC and HSQC spectra (Figure 8).27 The intramolecular conformational motion that our data support as intrinsic to both the apo and substrate-bound forms of RNase A further suggests that ligand binding shifts a thermodynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations. This notion is supported by our comparison of the signs of 15N chemical-shift changes conf and bind. The sign of the shift change from binding is selfevident in the progression of NMR peaks through a series of ligand-titration spectra. For example, the sign of bind is given by the difference in peak positions in the HSQC for apo and HSQC for pTppAp-bound RNase A, as shown in column 2 of Figure 8c. The sign of conf is more subtly obtained according to the observation by Kay and co-workers that HSQC spectra exhibit exchange-averaged peaks closer to the minor conformer's "invisible" resonance than do the corresponding peaks in HMQC spectra.27 Figure 8 illustrates this effect. To substantiate the idea that binding induces a population shift in a conserved, intrinsic opened/closed dynamic, we compared the signs of conf(apo) and bind for 20 residues that both exhibit the exchange dynamic and shift significantly upon binding pTppAp: Q11, M13, S15, S16, T17, S22, M30, L35, K41, C58, K66, G68, T70, S80, T99, Q101, V118, H119, D121, A122. Seventeen of these have the same sign for bind (apo - pTppAp; column 2) and for conf (apo-HMQC - apo-HSQC; column 3), as shown in Figure 8c. This result is expected for an apo enzyme that includes a minor conformer resembling the bound form. Considering the pTppAp-bound enzyme (Figure 8c), we find that bind (apo - pTppAp; column 2) carries the opposite sign of conf (bound-HMQC - bound-HSQC; column 4) for 14 of the noted 20 residues. This conversely indicates that the bound enzyme includes a minor conformation similar to the average apo structure.

The data presented here indicate that RNase A possesses flexibility in and around the active site and that this motion is conserved when binding the substrate analogue pTppAp. The identical exchange rates and activation barriers for free and bound forms imply that the motion in both cases is similar. In addition, the occurrence of this motion on the same time scale as the rate-limiting product release step suggests that motion observed by NMR and the motion that controls the overall catalytic rate are the same. Chemical shift data support a scenario where RNase A samples the apo and bound conformations regardless of the presence of ligand. The binding of a molecule at the active site simply shifts the equilibrium toward the bound conformer. Overall, it appears that amino acid residues that line the bottom of the active site as well as loop residues in the substrate-binding site act in concert with catalytically essential residues to modulate motion in RNase A that is required for product release. Finally, it is likely that small differences exist in the structures of the bound conformer sampled in the absence of ligand and the bound conformation measured in the presence of ligand. Much of the substrate binding specificity originates from the sidechain residues in RNase A and the conformations of these sidechains may be different in RNase A when it is bound to different nucleotides thereby indicating the existence of several different bound conformations. Thus, the subtleties of the bound conformation, in particular at the sidechain positions may very well exhibit variability even though the studies in this work suggest the gross features of protein backbone exist in equilibrium between two conformations. The preservation of µs-ms motion upon binding ligand, as described in this study, presents an additional view of protein dynamics when compared with other work from our lab that demonstrated rigidification of RNase A dynamics on the psns time scale upon interaction with pTppAp.13 These studies suggest that consideration of these dynamical effects could aid in the design of more potent enzyme inhibitors.
