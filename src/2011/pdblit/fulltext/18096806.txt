characteristic of the hbA and the hbS alleles (Fig. 3B). DNA samples from control hbS/hbS mice, as well as from ear fibroblasts of treated hbS/hbS mice, did not display any bands corresponding to the hbA allele (Fig. 3B). Functional correction of the sickle cell defect was evaluated by electrophoresis for human b globin proteins A and S (HbA and HbS) in blood of untreated and treated hbS/hbS mice. Stable and significant detection of HbA protein (mean of 65% versus 0% out of total b globin protein in untreated hbS/hbS mice, P < 0.01) (fig. S8) and pronounced reduction in HbS protein 4 and 8 weeks after transplantation were seen in the blood of treated mice (Fig. 3C). Treated hbS/hbS mice had higher levels of HbS than control heterozygous hbA/hbS animals, most likely because only ~70% of the peripheral blood cells were derived from the iPS cells (Fig. 3A). Morphological analysis of red blood cells (RBCs) in blood smears of untreated hbS/hbS mice demonstrated an abundance of rigid elongated cells, consistent with sickle cell disease, and severe reticulocytosis (Fig. 3D) (13). In contrast, blood smears of the treated animals had a lower degree of polychromasia, which is consistent with decreased reticulocyte levels. Also, anisocytosis and poikolocytosis were decreased in treated animals (Fig. 3D). Blood count follow-up tests were performed up to 12 weeks after transplantation. Compared with untreated hbS/hbS mice, the treated animals had marked increases in RBC counts, hemoglobin, and packed cell volume levels (Table 1). Furthermore, hbS/hbS mice showed normalized mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red cell distribution width (RDW) index values, which are objective parameters for anisocytosis and poikolocytosis (Table 1 and Fig. 3D). An important indicator of sickle cell disease activity and severity is the elevated level of reticulocytes in peripheral blood, which are immature RBCs (17), reflecting increased production of RBCs to overcome their chronic loss. Reticulocyte count was dramatically reduced in blood of recipient sickle mice after corrective bone marrow transplantation (Table 1). Finally, we examined whether the urine concentration defect, which results from RBC sickling in renal tubules and consequent reduction in renal medullary blood flow (18, 19), and the general deteriorated systemic condition reflected by lower body weight and increased breathing (16), had been improved. All three pathological features were ameliorated in treated hbS/hbS mice (Table 1). In summary, our results indicate that all hematological and systemic parameters of sickle cell anemia improved substantially and were comparable to those in control mice (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Although none of the mice transplanted with iPS-derived cells showed any evidence of tumor formation, the possibility remains that malignancy may develop at later time points as a result of transgenes encoding oncogenic proteins (13). The ethical debate over "therapeutic cloning," as well as the technical difficulty and inefficiency of the process (20), has spurred the quest to achieve reprogramming of somatic cells by defined factors (5­9, 13). The recent strategy of deriving iPS cells from genetically unmodified donor cells based on morphological criteria (10, 11), as devised in this study to derive iPS cells from mice with sickle cell anemia, has simplified their potential use for therapeutic application or for studying diseases. The correction of sickle cell anemia described in our experiments indicates that harnessing autologous iPS-derived cells for therapeutic purposes recapitulates several of the promises offered previously by SCNT: (i) no requirement for administration of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the unmatched transplanted cells, (ii) the opportunity to repair genetic defects by homologous recombination, and (iii) the opportunity to repeatedly differentiate iPS cells into the desired cell type for continued therapy. Even though reprogramming of human somatic cells into iPS cells has now been achieved (6, 9), future therapeutic application of iPS cells in humans requires overcoming several obstacles: (i) bypassing the use of harmful oncogenes as part of the reprogramming factors (13), (ii) avoiding the use for gene delivery of retroviral vectors that carry the risk of insertional mutagenesis, and (iii) developing robust and reliable differentiation protocols for human iPS cells. Current advances in molecular reprogramming set the stage for devising alternative strategies, such as transient gene expression vectors, engineered membrane-permeable transcription factor proteins, or small molecules that can replace potentially hazardous factors and lessen the risk of cancer associated with the current reprogramming approach.

Structure of Gaq-p63RhoGEF-RhoA Complex Reveals a Pathway for the Activation of RhoA by GPCRs

Tesmer2,4 The guanine nucleotide exchange factor p63RhoGEF is an effector of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide­binding protein (G protein) Gaq and thereby links Gaq-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the activation of the small-molecular-weight G protein RhoA. We determined the crystal structure of the Gaqp63RhoGEF-RhoA complex, detailing the interactions of Gaq with the Dbl and pleckstrin homology (DH and PH) domains of p63RhoGEF. These interactions involve the effector-binding site and the C-terminal region of Gaq and appear to relieve autoinhibition of the catalytic DH domain by the PH domain. Trio, Duet, and p63RhoGEF are shown to constitute a family of Gaq effectors that appear to activate RhoA both in vitro and in intact cells. We propose that this structure represents the crux of an ancient signal transduction pathway that is expected to be important in an array of physiological processes. ho guanine nucleotide triphosphatases (GTPases) are peripheral membrane proteins that regulate essential cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and contraction. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are the bestcharacterized members of this family, and they

triphosphate (GTP)­bound state, a process accelerated by a large family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho GEFs). Most Rho GEFs contain a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain that is immediately followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (3, 4). In some Rho GEFs, the PH domain appears to autoinhibit the intrinsic GEF activity of the DH domain (5­7), a constraint that is presumably released upon interaction of the PH domain with membranes or other proteins. One such autoinhibited Rho GEF is p63RhoGEF (8­10), a RhoA-specific enzyme predominantly expressed in the heart and brain (11). p63RhoGEF is directly activated by members of the Gaq subfamily of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide­binding proteins (G proteins) (9, 10) and thus is regulated by G protein­coupled receptors (GPCRs). In contrast to the Ga13-regulated p115RhoGEF family (12, 13), p63RhoGEF does not contain a regulator of G protein signaling homology (RH) domain (8­10) to mediate interaction with Gaq. To define the minimal elements of p63RhoGEF that mediate Gaq activation in vitro, we expressed fragments of p63RhoGEF spanning residues 149 to 477 and 149 to 580 (p63-149-477 and p63-149-580) of the total 580 amino acids in Escherichia coli (14). The p63-149-477 fragment spans a region similar to that observed in the crystal structure of the Dbl's big sister (Dbs) Rho GEF domain (15) (figs. S1 and S2), whereas p63-149580 spans the entire region previously known to be important for Gaq binding and regulation (9). Both fragments possessed only weak GEF activity and stimulated nucleotide exchange on RhoA at less than 1/20th the rate of the isolated DH domain of p63RhoGEF (p63-149-338) (Fig. 1A and table S1). Of these fragments, only the p63-149-580 fragment could bind AlF4­-activated Gai/q (Fig. 1B, fig. S4, and table S1), a chimera in which the N-terminal helix of Gaq is replaced with that of Gai (16) and that activates p63RhoGEF similarly to wild-type Gaq in cells (fig. S3). To precisely define the Gaqbinding core of p63RhoGEF, we tested a series of 72 p63RhoGEF fragments spanning residues 295 to the C terminus for their ability to compete with p63-149580 for binding Gai/q. The minimal fragment required for full inhibition corresponded to p63295-502 (fig. S5). Like p63-149-580, p63-149-502 had low basal nucleotide exchange activity that could be activated by Gai/q in a saturable manner by

Fig. 1. Identification of the minimal fragment of p63RhoGEF regulated by Gaq. (A) Basal activity of p63RhoGEF fragments. Activity was monitored by the increase in fluorescence millipolarization (mP) of a fluorescent GTP analog as it bound RhoA. In this experiment, the p63RhoGEF DH domain was 25 and 35 times more effective in activating 2 mM RhoA than were the p63-149-477 and p63-149-502 fragments, respectively. Fold activation is the p63RhoGEF catalyzed nucleotide exchange rate divided by the intrinsic rate of RhoA. (B) Equilibrium binding of p63RhoGEF fragments to Gai/q. Dissociation constants (Kd's) were determined by an equilibrium-binding flow cytometry protein interaction assay (FCPIA) (27) using various concentrations of Alexa Fluor 532­labeled p63RhoGEF fragments. In this experiment, Kd was 43 ± 4 and 36 ± 3 nM for p63-149-580 and p63-149-502, respectively. No binding was observed for p63-149-477. Binding was monitored by the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and was corrected for nonspecific binding (MFI in the absence of AlF4­). (C) Stimulation of p63-149-502 by Gai/q. Activity was measured as in (A), but with added amounts of Gai/q. For fold activation mediated by Gai/q, see fig. S6. (D) Binding of p63149-502 to activated Gaq in cell lysates. HEK293 cells were transfected with 1 mg of GaqRC, 1 mg of the respective p63RhoGEF variant plasmid, and up to 2 mg of an empty control vector. Overexpressed fragments were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to c-Myc. Antibodies to c-Myc and Gaq/11 were used for analysis of precipitated proteins and equal overexpression. (E) Activation of RhoA in cells by p63RhoGEF fragments. HEK293 cells were transfected with 1.3 mg of the respective GEF variant plasmid, 0.6 mg of the GaqRC or M3-R­encoding plasmid, and up to 2 mg of an empty control vector. Cells overexpressing M3-R were stimulated for 3 min with 1 mM carbachol. Endogenous RhoA-GTP was detected through its association with the Rho-binding domain of rhotekin. Total RhoA was detected with an antibody to RhoA. (F) SRF activation by p63RhoGEF fragments. HEK293 cells were transfected with 12.5 ng of GaqRC plasmids, up to 50 ng of p63 construct plasmids, and up to 100 ng of an empty control vector as indicated. For expression of SRF-driven firefly luciferase and constitutively expressed renilla luciferase, 21 ng of pSRE.L and 4 ng of pRL.TK were cotransfected.

mutant (Fig. 1D). The p63-149-482, p63-149-492, and p63-149-502 fragments also mediated GaqRC- and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-R)­induced activation of RhoA and SRF (Fig. 1, E and F), with p63-149-502 being nearly as effective as wild-type p63RhoGEF. The molecular basis for the interaction between Gaq and p63RhoGEF was determined by the 3.5 Å crystal structure of p63-149-502 in complex with AlF4­-activated Gai/q and RhoA (Fig. 2, figs. S7 and S8, and table S2). Gai/q engages both the DH and PH domains of p63RhoGEF, burying over 3600 Å2 of accessible surface area (Fig. 2), using residues that are highly conserved in the Trio family but not in Dbs (fig. S2). No contacts are formed between Gai/q and RhoA. The PH domain of p63RhoGEF interacts with Gai/q primarily using a kinked amphipathic helical extension of its PH domain (aCa and aCb helices, residues 471 to 485), which docks into the effector-binding site of Gai/q (Fig. 3A). In addition, the a2-b4 and a3-b5 loops of Gai/q interact with residues in the 310 helix and the b2-b3 and b4-b5 loops of the p63RhoGEF PH domain (Fig. 3B). The DH domain of p63RhoGEF interacts with the a3-b5 and a4-b6 loops and the C-terminal a5 helix of Gai/q on the side of its helical bundle opposite to the RhoAbinding site (Figs. 2 and 3B). The extreme C terminus of Gai/q packs against a notch formed by a break in the a2 helix of the DH domain, where the side chain of Tyr356 in Gai/q forms extensive contacts (Fig. 3B). Thus, the C terminus of Ga can mediate interactions with effectors as well as couple to specific GPCRs (17). Overall, the interaction of Gai/q with the PH domain of p63RhoGEF is quite similar to the interaction of Gai/q with GRK2 (Fig. 4, A and B) (16), with the most pronounced difference in Gai/q being the conformation of the a2-b4, a3-b5, and a4-b6 loops, which can mold themselves to form highaffinity interactions with at least two distinct effector surfaces. The conserved manner in which the PH domains of p63RhoGEF and GRK2 engage their activated heterotrimeric G protein targets (Gai/q and Gbg, respectively) is likewise striking (18) (Fig. 4, A and C). Site-directed mutants of p63-149-502 were produced to test the role of three regions of the Gai/q-p63RhoGEF interface: the interface of the Gai/q effector-binding site with the PH domain extension (Fig. 3A), the interface of the Gai/q a2b4/a3-b5 loops with the remainder of the PH domain, and the interface of the Gai/q a3-b5/a5 region with the DH domain (Fig. 3B). Each mutant was tested for intrinsic GEF activity as well as for its ability to bind and be activated by Gai/q (Table 1). The alteration of residues in the PH domain extension eliminated Gai/q binding and activation, consistent with a recent study (10). Mutations in the DH and PH domains of p63RhoGEF exhibited only minimal defects in binding Gai/q, but some were greatly impaired in Gai/q activation (Table 1), including Glu385Ala385 (E385A) (19) and Q386A (in the interface with the a2-b4 and a3-b5 loops of Gaq); W216F, R244A, and R245A (in the interface with the a3-b5 and a4-b6 loops of Gaq); and R204A (in the interface with the a5 C terminus of Gaq). The in vitro activation of p63RhoGEF thus appears to require the interaction of Gai/q with both the DH and PH domains (Table 1). We compared

our structure of p63-149-502 to those of the related DH and PH domains of Dbs and the N-terminal set of DH and PH domains of Trio (N-Trio), which are not activated by Gaq (20). The DH and PH domains of Dbs and N-Trio interact through conserved residues at their interface and adopt similar conformations in both GTPase-bound and free states (15, 20­22). Although residues analogous to these are conserved in p63RhoGEF (fig. S2), the position of the PH domain of Gai/q-bound p63RhoGEF is rotated by ~50° around the a6 helix of the DH domain relative to those of Dbs and N-Trio (Fig. 4D). Thus, one way in which Gaq might activate p63RhoGEF is to use its domainbridging interactions to constrain the otherwise inhibitory PH domain away from the RhoA binding site. In cells, Gaq could regulate p63RhoGEF in additional ways, such as by targeting p63RhoGEF to the plasma membrane, where constraints imposed by the interactions of both proteins with the phospholipid bilayer could in addition optimize the conformation of the DH and PH domains. We next investigated whether Gaq binds to and stimulates the closely related set of DH and PH domains found in the C terminus of Trio (23) and Duet (24) (figs. S1 and S2). We constructed variants of Trio and Duet analogous to p63-149-502 (Trio1894-2232 and Duet-219-558) and demonstrated that these proteins bind and are activated by Gai/q in vitro (Fig. 5, A and B, and table S1). In cells, Trio-18942232 and Duet-219-558 co-immunoprecipitated with GaqRC (Fig. 5C), mediated GaqRC- as well as M3-R­induced activation of RhoA (Fig. 5D and fig. S9), and enhanced GaqRC- as well as M3-R­ or H1-R­induced activation of SRF, similar to fulllength Trio and Duet (Fig. 5E). As in humans (25), a splice variant of the Caenorhabditis elegans Trio ortholog exists that contains only its C-terminal set of RhoA-specific DH and PH domains (fig. S2). This variant, UNC73 E, is also activated by the constitutively active C. elegans ortholog of Gaq and was recently shown to be a critical regulator of neuronal signaling (26). Thus, Trio, Duet, and p63RhoGEF define a previously unknown class of Gaq/11-regulated Rho GEFs in higher vertebrates that diverged from a single ancient trio gene. Our structure of the Gai/q-p63RhoGEF-RhoA complex reveals three nodes of a signal transduc-

Fig. 3. Stereo views of interfaces of the Gai/q·p63RhoGEF complex. (A) The interaction of the PH domain extension with the effector-binding site of Gai/q. The p63RhoGEF aCa helix kinks at residue 477 to form a ~70° elbow, with the subsequent aCb helix packing against the a3 helix of Gai/q. The nonpolar interactions between residues in aCa and the effector-binding site are the most important for high-affinity binding (Table 1). Residues from the PH domain are violet, and those from Gai/q are cyan. (B) Interactions of the DH and PH domains with the a-b loops and C terminus of Gai/q. The a2-b4 loop of Gai/q appears to stack against an Arg244-Glu385 salt bridge that bridges the DH and PH domains. The side chain of Gaq-Tyr356 at the end of a5 packs against the side of the DH domain, adjacent to p63RhoGEF residues Arg204, Ile205, Gly208, and Asn255. Fig. 4. Emerging themes for protein-protein interactions mediated by Gaq and PH domains and a model for p63RhoGEF activation by Gai/q. (A) The p63RhoGEF PH domain in complex with Gai/q. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is modeled based on the phospholipase C­g PH domain·IP3 complex (29) to help define the expected plane of the lipid bilayer. (B) GRK2 binds similarly to the Gai/q effector-binding site, using exposed hydrophobic residues in its a5 helix. Only the a5 and a6 helices of the GRK2 RH domain are shown. In both the p63RhoGEF and GRK2 complexes, Gai/q is held in an orientation in which its longest axis is roughly parallel and switch I is held relatively close to the predicted membrane surface (top). In both complexes, the switch I region appears available for the simultaneous binding of regulator of G protein signaling proteins (30). (C) The GRK2 and p63RhoGEF PH domains engage their protein targets in a similar way, using a C-terminal helical extension and the loops at one edge of the b1-b4 sheet of the PH domain to form an extensive protein interaction site (Fig. 3). (D) The DH and PH domains of p63RhoGEF adopt a conformation distinct from that of Dbs (black). The view is the same as in Fig. 2A. The bridging interactions of Gai/q (spheres) appear to rotate the position of the p63RhoGEF PH domain away from the RhoA binding site on the DH domain, along the plane of the membrane surface.

(E) The influence of p63-149-502, p63-FL, Duet-219-558, Duet, Trio-1894-2232, and Trio on GaqRC-, or M3-R­ or H1-R­induced SRF activation. HEK293 cells were transfected with 30 ng of GaqRC, M3-R, or H1-R plasmids, 60 ng of the GEF plasmids, and up to 90 ng of an empty control vector as indicated. For expression of SRF-driven firefly luciferase and constitutively expressed renilla luciferase, 21 ng of pSRE.L and 4 ng of pRL.TK were cotransfected. Cells overexpressing M3-R and H1-R were stimulated for 24 hours with 1 mM carbachol or 100 mM histamine, respectively. Means ± SE (n = 12 samples) of firefly/renilla luciferase ratios are given.

tion cascade caught in the act of transferring an extracellular signal from heterotrimeric to smallmolecular-weight G proteins. The cornerstone of this complex is the PH domain, which engages the DH domain, Gai/q, and also probably the membrane using conserved basic residues in its b2 and b4 strands (Fig. 4 and fig. S2). The orientation we predict for Gaq in complex with p63RhoGEF at the membrane appears similar to that predicted for its complex with GRK2-Gbg (16) (Figs. 2B and 4)­one that is dramatically different from the expected orientation for Gaq in the inactive Gabg heterotrimer (17). These results suggest that a conserved signaling complex is assembled at or near activated Gq-coupled receptors, wherein activated Gaq becomes fixed in orientation with respect to the membrane and serves as a GTP-dependent docking site for structurally diverse effector enzymes.
