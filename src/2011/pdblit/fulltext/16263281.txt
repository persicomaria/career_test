Abstract--This letter describes replacements for the P3 amide moiety present in previously reported tertiary carbinamine macrolactones. Although P-gp efflux issues associated with these amide-macrolactones were solved and full brain penetration was measured in one case, potency was compromised in the process. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the brain that leads to a progressive decline in cognitive function and ultimately incapacitation and death.1 AD is characterized by the presence of insoluble amyloid plaques and fibrillary tangles, which are key pathological features of this devastating disease. The major component of these plaques is Ab40À42, a neurotoxic peptide fragment of b-amyloid precursor protein (APP) generated by the proteolytic action of the band c-secretase enzymes. Of these two enzymes, b-secretase (b-site APP Cleaving Enzyme or BACE-1), an aspartyl protease, is considered rate-limiting in this proteolytic cleavage process.2 As such, BACE-1 inhibition is widely hypothesized to be one of the most promising therapeutic approaches for the treatment of AD.3 The development of low molecular weight, brain penetrant BACE-1 inhibitors has been extremely challenging.3 Most efforts have relied on the use of transition

state isosteres such as hydroxyethylamines (HEA), reduced amides, statines, and aminostatines to interact with the catalytic aspartates.3 The incorporation of these motifs into high molecular weight inhibitors negatively impacts pharmacokinetics and penetration of the blood brain barrier (BBB). The discovery of non-transition state isostere tertiary carbinamine derived BACE-1 ligands was recently disclosed.4 Inhibitors based on this novel `warhead' motif displayed comparable potency

to classical HEA inhibitors although stability, pharmacokinetics and brain penetration remained an issue. Macrolactones such as 1a,b (Fig. 1) derived from this new scaffold displayed a large increase in potency and stability but no significant improvement in pharmacokinetics and BBB penetration.5 Additional work in this series indicated that the P3 amide moiety, necessary for making a critical interaction with BACE-1 Gly230, could be altered to afford molecules with similar potency and reduced P-gp liabilities.6,11 Herein is described our efforts to replace the P3 amide in an attempt to improve BBB penetration. Our first strategy relied on the replacement of the P3 amide with a trifluoroethylamine moiety, following precedent reported by Blacket al.8 Previous crystallographic analyses demonstrated that the P3 carbonyl does not interact directly with the enzyme,4 which should allow for its replacement without consequences on inhibitory potency. The interaction of the amide NH with Gly230 could be maintained via an amide surrogate. The trifluoromethyl group has been shown to have an electronic effect similar to that of the carbonyl on the pKa of the NH,8 and should therefore not affect its critical H-bonding potential to Gly230. Furthermore, the amide carbonyl represents a classical recognition element to the P-gp efflux pump, its replacement with a trifluoromethyl group might decrease the compound's susceptibility to P-gp. Figure 2 illustrates the replacement of the P3 amide carbonyl with a trifluoromethyl group and its transport by P-gp (2a: B À A/ A À B = 1.3 vs. 1a: B À A/A À B = 16);9 unfortunately this is achieved at the cost of potency. The accompanying sp2­sp2 to sp3­sp3 hybridization switch in the context of a strained macrocyclic ring may have unfavorably altered the vector of the P3 NH toward Gly230. In order to allow for more conformational flexibility, the acyclic analog 1d was evaluated. Although 1d

displayed a significant reduction in P-gp susceptibility,9,10 it was also considerably less potent than either carbonyl containing compounds 1a or 1c. Replacement of the P3­P2 carboxamide-phenyl combination with a P3­P2 cyclopropylamino-pyridine scaffold has been shown to reduce P-gp susceptibility while maintaining adequate potency11and was considered as a second strategy. Indeed aminopyridine 3a maintains modest potency at 400 nM with a concomitant lowering of P-gp susceptibility (B À A/A À B = 2.9, Table 1). N-Alkylation was then considered to simultaneously occupy S3 and remove the NH that could serve as a recognition element for the P-gp efflux pump. However, N-substituted aminopyridine-macrolactones 3b­d suffered a significant loss in potency, indicating that S3 access directly from the a-position is suboptimal. A third strategy involved the removal of any heteroatom from the P2­P3 linker and accessing S3 from the more traditional c-position.5 The concept was initially applied in the P2 phenyl mode with a P3 methyl, providing macrolactone 4a, as a non P-gp substrate (B À A/

X-ray crystallography was used to compare the binding of ligands 4b and 1b and to help rationalize these results. In the absence of heteroatoms in the P2­P3 linker of ligands 4b­d, there can be no hydrogen bonding interaction with BACE-1 Thr232, giving Thr232 the opportunity to hydrogen bond to Ser10 and thus inducing a 10s loop ``down'' configuration (Fig. 3a). As predicted15 and as observed earlier,11 a small hydrophobic P3 group such as the methyl exemplified in 4a,b is the best fit for the small S3 pocket in this 10s loop ``down'' configuration. The larger P3 phenyl (4d) likely maintains the 10s loop in an ``up'' configuration that is non-optimal in such cases where the ligand cannot H-bond with Thr232. In the case of P3 amide inhibitors such as 1b,5 Thr232 is engaged by the amide carbonyl resulting in a 10s loop ``up'' configuration and a larger S3 pocket which is best occupied by a P3 phenyl (Fig. 3b).5,15

A À B = 1.4) displaying moderate potency against BACE-1 (IC50 = 1700 nM). Encouraged by this result, we applied this strategy to the P2 pyridyl analog and resolved all four diastereoisomers. Enantiomer 4b was evaluated as a 1800 nM inhibitor. X-ray crystallographic analysis of 4b bound to BACE-1 (Fig. 3a) confirmed4,5 the R configuration at the tertiary carbinamine center; however, the absolute configuration at the c-position was unexpectedly found to be S.13 Gratifyingly, 4b was found to effectively penetrate the BBB (at 2 h, [4b]brain = 637 nM, [brain]/[plasma] = 130%).14 Guided by earlier SAR in the P3 amide mode,5 the previously optimal P3 phenyl was incorporated (4c) resulting in a surprising decrease in potency. Complete removal of the P3 group (4d) resulted in further loss of potency.

structed from the hydroboration of alkene 14 followed by Suzuki-Miyaura coupling to halides 20 or 21. After silyl deprotection and ester hydrolysis, macrocyclization was executed using an intramolecular Mitsunobu reaction which provided macrolactones 4a,b,d in excellent yields. For compound 4c, bis-carboxylic acid 16 was used in place of the corresponding diene to avoid double bond migration that would generate styrenes. Mono-esterification of 16 followed by borane reduction, and conversion to the alkyl iodide provided the corresponding ester-iodide. The resulting iodide was activated using Rieke zinc and utilized in a Negishi coupling with pyridyl chloride 21 to give ester 18. Reduction of the ester, conversion to the alkyl iodide and Rieke zinc activation enabled a second Negishi coupling with aryl bromide 9 to yield 19, which underwent macrocyclization using the established protocol to afford macrolactone 4c. In conclusion, various replacements for the P3 amide functionality embedded in tertiary carbinamine macrolactones were discussed. Although P-gp efflux issues were solved in most cases and brain penetration was attained in vivo for 4b, potency was compromised in the process. Optimization of S3 access from the aminopyridine scaffold 3a will be the subject of future work, to be described in due time.

The synthetic routes16 toward trifluoromethyl derivatives 2a and 1d are outlined in Scheme 1. Benzyl alcohol 5 was oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde, which then underwent nucleophilic addition of CF3­TMS in the presence of catalytic TBAF.17 The resulting alcohol was then converted to triflate 6, and amine displacement afforded 7. Hydroboration of 7 followed by SuzukiMiyaura coupling to aryl bromide 9 (from Scheme 2) sets the key molecular framework. The synthesis of 2aculminated in a macrolactonization under Mitsunobu conditions. For 1d, (R)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)ethanamine was employed to displace triflate 6; formation of the oxadiazole ring was accomplished under dehydrative conditions using carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine. Boc deprotection afforded inhibitor 1d. The syntheses16 of inhibitors 3a­d are outlined in Scheme 2. Hydrolysis of methyl ester 11 was followed by carboxylate alkylation with 22, and reduction of the azide moiety with triphenylphosphine afforded amine 12. With the ester bond intact, macrocyclization could be executed using a palladium mediated macrocyclic N-arylation18 was followed by protecting group removal to give inhibitor 3a. The macrocyclization could also be achieved using secondary amines, resulting from reductive aminations with the necessary aldehydes to give inhibitors 3b­d. Macrolactones 4a,b,d were prepared16 as outlined in Scheme 3. A fully saturated carbon linker could be con-

The stereochemistry of the active diastereoisomer is known to always be R at the tertiary carbinamine center, based on earlier X-ray crystallographic analysis of tertiary carbinamine/P3-amide based acyclic and macrocyclic inhibitors Refs. 4,5. Additionally, chiral separations performed earlier on similar mixture of diastereoisomers indicated that the diastereoisomers derived from the S tertiary carbinamine are all devoid of significant activity against BACE-1, thus justifying IC50 calculations from mixtures Refs. 5,12. 13. The R configuration at the c-position for inhibitor 4b is opposite to what was previously observed with P3 amide tertiary carbinamine inhibitors (S) Ref. 5. This inversion of configuration is likely allowed by the increased conformational flexibility introduced in the chain when switching from an amide to ethylene linker. Only one of the other three diastereoisomers displayed inhibitory potency at 17 lM. This isomer most likely has the correct R configuration at the tertiary carbinamine center and the S configuration at the c-position. 14.
