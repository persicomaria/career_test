Abstract Purified catalase-1 (CAT-1) from Neurospora crassa asexual spores is oxidized by singlet oxygen giving rise to active enzyme forms with different electrophoretic mobility. These enzyme forms are detected in vivo under stress conditions and during development at the start of the asexual morphogenetic transitions. CAT-1 heme b is oxidized to heme d by singlet oxygen. Here, we describe functional and structural comparisons of the non-oxidized enzyme with the fully oxidized one. Using a broad H2O2 concentration range (0.01­3.0 M), non-hyperbolic saturation kinetics was found in both enzymes, indicating that kinetic complexity does not arise from heme oxidation. The kinetics was consistent with the existence of two kinds of active sites differing more than 10-times in substrate affinity. Positive cooperativity for one or both of the saturation curves is possible. Kinetic constants obtained at 22 °C varied slightly and apparent activation energies for the reaction of both components are not significantly different. Protein fluorescence and circular dicroism of the two enzymes were nearly identical, indicating no gross conformational change with oxidation. Increased sensitivity to inhibition by cyanide indicated a local change at the active site in the oxidized catalase. Oxidized catalase was less resistant to high temperatures, high guanidinium ion concentration, and digestion with subtilisin. It was also less stable than the non-oxidized enzyme at an acid pH. The overall data show that the oxidized enzyme is structurally different from the non-oxidized one, although it conserves most of the remarkable stability and catalytic efficiency of the non-oxidized enzyme. Because the enzyme in the cell can be oxidized under physiological conditions, preservation of functional and structural properties of catalase could have been selected through evolution to assure an active enzyme under oxidative stress conditions. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

1. Introduction Many bacteria, fungi, and plants have more than one catalase (EC 1.11.1.6, hydrogen peroxide:hydrogen peroxide oxido-reductase). Catalases are differently regulated and some catalases are related to development [1­13]. Catalase activity during the Neurospora crassa asexual life cycle increases

stepwise; asexual spores (conidia) have 60 times more catalase activity than hyphae growing in a liquid medium. This large increase in catalase activity is due to catalase-1 (CAT-1) synthesis during conidia formation and maturation [10]. The activity of another catalase, catalase-3, increases at the end of exponential growth and during adhesion of hyphae [10]. A null mutant strain of catalase-3 greatly increases aerial hyphae and conidia formation [12]. These results support the hypothesis that cell differentiation in N. crassa is a response to oxidative stress [14,15] and highlight the importance of catalases in cell differentiation. Catalase is one of the most efficient enzymes known. Although extensively studied, many open questions remain to be answered for an enzyme that catalyzes an apparently very simple reaction: dismutation of two hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) molecules into two water and a dioxygen molecules. Small catalases (subunit of 60 kDa) are reversibly inhibited

and irreversibly inactivated by substrate. In contrast, large catalases (subunit of 80 kDa) resist molar concentrations of H2O2 [16,17]. Resistance to substrate inhibition and inactivation in large catalases is in part due to a low rate formation of inactive compound II and III [18]. In contrast of not being inhibited by substrate, large catalase activity is actually stimulated by H2O2 at increasing concentrations [16­18]. The activation mechanism is not known. CAT-1 is a homotetrameric, glycosylated, and large catalase. It is an enormously efficient enzyme, which is not inhibited by molar concentrations of H2O2. It also exhibits an unusual resistance to denaturation by temperature and various denaturants [16]. The enzyme is irreversibly oxidized in the course of few weeks of storage. This is accompanied by increased enzyme mobility in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), yet it preserves its molecular mass and its activity. In a zymogram of the gel, five activity bands can be observed depending on the degree of oxidation. The less acidic band corresponds to the non-oxidized enzyme (CAT-1a) (pI 5.45), the more acidic band corresponds to the fully oxidized (CAT-1e) (pI 5.25); CAT-1b to CAT-1d are intermediate forms [19]. Storage under argon prevents CAT-1 oxidation. Exposure of purified CAT-1a to a pure source of singlet oxygen causes a rapid oxidation and the characteristic change in electrophoretic mobility; no other reactive oxygen species could generate a similar electrophoretic shift [19]. Catalases assayed from bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal sources are likewise oxidized by singlet oxygen producing increase in enzyme electrophoretic mobility [19]. In N. crassa, the large catalase-3 [10] and a catalaseperoxidase, catalase-2 [19], which is a completely different heme­enzyme, are similarly oxidized by singlet oxygen, causing a shift in their electrophoretic mobility. However, the electrophoretic shift in these enzymes is much smaller than in CAT-1. Oxidation of CAT-1 occurs in vivo under conditions in which singlet oxygen is generated [20]. Human catalase oxidation by singlet oxygen takes place in cultures of myeloid cell (U937) [21]. In fact, because it is exclusively generated by singlet oxygen, the change in electrophoretic mobility of catalases can be used to detect singlet oxygen formation inside cells [22]. A site of modification in CAT-1 is heme: UV-visible absorbance spectra of the heme indicated that singlet oxygen modification of the enzyme increased heme asymmetry [19], which is consistent with heme b to heme d transformation. The crystal structure of CAT-1 indicates modification of heme b to a cis-hydroxyl-c-spirolactone at the porphyrin ring III (heme d) [23] like in the two other large catalases, Escherichia coli HPII and Penicillium vitale, catalase, whose tri-dimensional structure is known [24]. Enzyme activity is required for heme b to heme d oxidation [25]. Our hypothesis is that singlet oxygen at the active site reacts with heme b to form heme d. Because oxidation of heme per se does not change protein charge, modification of one or few charged amino acid resi-

dues, or loss of a charged protein end, could explain the electrophoretic shift. No modification of amino acids was observed in the crystal structure of CAT-1 [23], however the N-terminal loose end in the structure is not visible and a modification at a residue situated in this end might have taken place. Another possibility is that heme modification causes a structural change that modifies the charge of the protein. To investigate the functional and structural consequences of catalase oxidation, we compared the kinetics, some structural properties, and the stability of the non-oxidized enzyme (CAT-1a) with those of the fully oxidized one (CAT-1e). Both enzymes exhibited complex saturation kinetics by H2O2 with similar kinetic constants and activation energies. Slight structural differences between CAT-1e and CAT-1a and differences in stability between them were detected under extreme situations. However, CAT-1e conserves most of the remarkable stability and catalytic efficiency of the nonoxidized enzyme. Because the enzyme in the cell can be oxidized under physiological conditions, preservation of functional and structural properties of catalase could have been selected through evolution to assure an active enzyme under oxidative stress conditions.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals, strains, and culture conditions Chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. N. crassa, wild type strain 74-OR23-1A from the Fungal Genetic Stock Center, was grown from stocks of conidia kept in distilled water at ­70 °C. Conidia were inoculated on agar minimal-medium of Vogel supplemented with 1.5% sucrose. Cultures were grown for 3 days in the dark at 30 °C followed by 2 days in the light at 25 °C. 2.2. Purification of CAT-1 CAT-1 was purified from conidiated aerial mycelium as described previously [16,19]. Briefly, cultures were harvested directly in acetone and collected by filtering through filter paper. Dried acetone powders were ground with glass beads in a cold buffer containing protease inhibitors and antioxidants. Cell extract was frozen and thawed twice and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was precipitated with cold acetone. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged and the supernatant was precipitated with 35% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The dissolved pellet was passed through a Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) column and eluted with 10 mM phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.8, adjusted by mixing Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4 solutions. The purified enzyme gave a yield of 48% of the total cell extract activity and an increase in catalase specific activity of 170 times. After PAGE with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the preparation showed a main band of 88 kDa and few minor bands [16].

Catalase modification occurred during storage. After storage in 50 mM PB for 8 weeks at ­20 °C, most of the catalase activity is CAT-1e and no further shift in electrophoretic mobility was observed. Oxidation of the enzyme can be prevented by storage under an argon atmosphere [19]. 2.3. Enzyme assays and kinetics 2.3.1. Catalase assay Catalase activity was measured at 22 °C by determining the initial rate of O2 production with a Clark electrode [26]. Reaction was started by injecting catalase into a sealed chamber filled with 2 ml of a known concentration of H2O2 in PB. H2O2 concentration was determined spectroscopically at 240 nm considering an extinction coefficient of 35.76 M-1 cm-1 [18]. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the consumption of 1 µmol H2O2 per min under our experimental conditions. Nonenzymatic H2O2 decomposition (base line) was subtracted from each determination. 2.3.2. Saturation kinetics The initial velocity data obtained in the range of 10 mM­ 3 M H2O2 concentration was fitted to equation 1, which is the result of adding two Hill equations: m = Vmax

remaining activity was assayed as stated above. The residual activity data were fitted using the Microcal Origin program by non-linear regression to a single exponential decay equation (Eq. (3)): Et/E0 = exp -kt (3)

where Et and E0 are the enzyme activities at time t and zero, respectively, k is the pseudo-first-order rate constant of inactivation, and t is the time of incubation. For determination of the concentration of azide or hydroxylamine giving half maximal inactivation, I50, CAT-1 (1 µg in 2 ml) (3 µM) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 min in the presence of several concentrations of the inhibitors and the remaining activity was measured by adding to the mixture 10 mM H2O2. Inactivation was pseudo-first order and the experimental data were fitted with the Microcal Origin program to Eq. (4), Et/E0 = exp -kIt (4)

where v is the initial velocity, Vmax(1) and Vmax(2) are the maximal velocities of each component, S0.5(1) and S0.5(2) are the concentrations of substrate producing half maximal velocity, and n(1) and n(2) are the Hill numbers. Kinetics was analyzed with the Microcal Origin (Microcal Software, Inc. Northampton, MA USA) computer program. 2.3.3. Apparent activation energy The activation energy, Ea, was determined by measuring the initial velocities at temperatures between 15 and 35 °C, in increments of 5 °C, using for kcat determination a H2O2 concentration range between 20 and 700 mM. The dependence of kcat on temperature was determined using the Arrhenius equation (Eq. (2)): ln kcat = -Ea/RT + ln A (2)

where k is the second order rate constant of inactivation, and I is the inhibitor concentration. The reversible inhibition of CAT-1 (0.2 µg in 5 µl PB) by potassium cyanide (KCN) (Merck) was measured at 22 °C using different concentrations of the inhibitor (0.4­1.0 µM) and different concentrations of H2O2 (8­60 mM). Final concentration of catalase was 1.5 nM. Replots of the apparent KM values, obtained in the presence of the inhibitor, vs. inhibitor concentration were linear. The inhibition constant, Ki, was estimated by a lineal fitting of the apparent Km data to Eq. (5) and utilizing the Microcal Origin program:

where R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and A is the Arrhenius constant. 2.3.4. Inhibition and inactivation of catalase Irreversible inactivation of CAT-1 by 3-amino-1,2,4triazole was studied at 37 °C by incubating 20 µg of the enzyme in 1 ml PB, containing 20 mM 3-amino-1,2,4triazole, 4 mM ascorbate and 4 mM H2O2 [27]. Final concentration of catalase was 150 nM. Samples (50 µl) were withdrawn every 5 min from the incubation mixture and the

2.3.5. pH dependence and pH inactivation For determination of the pH dependence of enzyme activity, a mixture of 50 mM each of the following buffers 2-(Nmorpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES) and 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPS) was adjusted to the desired pH with 0.5 M HCl or NaOH, as required. Catalase activity was assayed with 10 mM H2O2. To measure CAT-1stability in acid, the enzyme was incubated for 5 min at the indicated acidic pH (acetate buffer 50 mM) and the remaining activity determined at the usual pH and with 10 mM H2O2. Activity assayed at pH 7.8 in 50 mM PB was taken as 100%. 2.4. Protein determination Protein in fractions of purified CAT-1 was determined by its absorbency at 280 nm utilizing an extinction coefficient of 88,810 M­1 cm­1, which was calculated from the protein sequence [28]. Similarly, an extinction coefficient of 24,870 M­1 cm­1 was used for subtilisin.

2.5. Spectra Protein fluorescence spectra of CAT-1, 150 µg/ml in PB, at 25 °C, were obtained by exciting protein residues at a wavelength of 280 nm and detecting emission between 300 and 400 nm. Circular dicroism spectra of CAT-1, 200 µg/ml in PB, were obtained in the range of 185­250 nm using a 0.1 path cuvette at 25 °C, and expressed in molar ellipticity (H) (degrees cm2 dmol­1). The amount of structure was determined using the software Prosec (AVIV Instruments). Heme fluorescence emission spectra were carried out at 25 °C using 5 mg of total catalase protein in PB, by exciting at 400 nm and measuring emission between 420 and 700 nm. 2.6. Gel electrophoresis Minigels (8 × 9 cm and 0.75 mm thick, 8% polyacrylamide 0.2% bis-acrylamide) were used for detection of catalase activity bands. They were made according to the Laemmli procedure, without boiling the samples, and without b-mercapto-ethanol. Gels were run at 150 V for 2.5 h and immediately after electrophoresis stained for catalase activity. Catalase activity in polyacrylamide gels was assayed as described [19]. After electrophoresis the gel was briefly soaked in 5% (v:v) methanol and after rinsing with tap water, it was incubated for 10 min in 10 mM H2O2. For staining, the gel was incubated in a 1:1 mixture of freshly prepared 2% (w:v) potassium ferric cyanide and 2% (w:v) ferric chloride. Blue color developed in the gel except at the zones where H2O2 was decomposed by catalase. Staining was stopped by soaking the gel in a 10% (v:v) acetic acid and 5% (v:v) methanol solution. 2.7. CAT-1 thermal and chemical stabilities CAT-1 (7 µg in 20 µl PB) was incubated for 1 h at different temperatures and the remaining activity and protein were analyzed by PAGE (5 µg in each lane) under non-denaturing conditions as described above. CAT-1 (10 µg in 20 µl PB) was incubated with different concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (Boehringer Mannheim) for 72 h at room temperature to reach equilibrium. Samples were divided in two and subjected to PAGE under non-denaturing conditions (5 µg per lane). One gel with 0.3 µg per lane was stained for activity; the other with 5 µg per lane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. 2.8. Subtilisin treatment Subtilisin (7.5 µg in 2.5 µl PB) was added to 50 µg of CAT-1 in 20 µl PB and the mixture incubated at 30 °C during 28 h. At the indicated times, 1.5 µl of 1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in dimethylsulfoxide was added to stop the reaction and catalase activity was determined by

oxymetry, using 2 µg, and by zymograms, using 1 µg of CAT-1. The products of proteolysis of 5 µg of CAT-1 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE [29].

3. Results Singlet oxygen reacts at the active site of CAT-1 and induces the formation of an active enzyme that contains heme d instead of heme b and exhibits a shift in electrophoretic mobility [19]. The effect of these changes on the functional and structural properties of CAT-1 was studied. 3.1. Saturation kinetics of the CAT-1 Different to small catalases and similar to other large catalases [17], CAT-1 is resistant to molar concentrations of H2O2 [16]. Catalase activity with increasing H2O2 concentration does not follow Michaelis­Menten kinetics [17,18]. Because they are not inhibited or inactivated by substrate, CAT-1 and other large catalases are amenable to a careful kinetic analysis extending in a very wide range of substrate concentration. Saturation kinetics of oxidized and nonoxidized CAT-1 by H2O2 was complex and could be divided into two components. The initial velocity data obtained in the range of 0.01­3 M H2O2 concentration gave a good fit to Eq. (1), which is the result of adding two Hill equations. Fig. 1 shows the experimental data and the theoretical lines resulting from the global fit of 36 activity determinations; the estimated kinetic parameters are given in Table 1. In order to better depict the goodness of the fit to our data, the log of substrate concentration is given in the plots of Fig. 1, as we used a very broad range. The theoretical global curve resulting from the best fit to Eq. (1), with Hill numbers of 1.2 and 1.7 for the first and second component of the saturation curve, is shown as a solid line. Dashed lines are the individual theoretical curves for each component (Fig. 1A,B). The second best fit for the whole set of data was to a two-component equation without cooperativity. Residuals (differences between theoretical and experimental values), given below the activity vs. log (H2O2 concentration) plots in Fig. 1, show that a two-component equation, either with or without cooperativity, gave a much better fit to the whole set of data than a single Michaelis­Menten equation. Thus, the saturation kinetics of CAT-1 by H2O2 appears to have two components, consistent with the existence of two kinds of active sites, either in the same or in separate enzyme molecules, differing more than 10-times in substrate affinity. One of the active sites is saturated in a low H2O2 concentration range and the other in a high concentration. Both components appear to have a positive cooperativity, which is higher in the second component. Compared to CAT-1a, the kinetics of CAT-1e were slightly different: both S0.5 values were somewhat higher and both catalytic efficiencies, kcat/S0.5, were consequently lower but not significantly different (Table 1).

Table 1 Kinetic constants of CAT-1a and CAT-1e catalase activity was measured at 22 °C by determining the initial rate of O2 production with a Clark electrode. Values were calculated using Eq. (1), with Hill numbers of 1.2 and 1.7 for the first and second component of the saturation curve. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the consumption of 1 µmol H2O2 per min under our experimental conditions S0.5(1) (M) Vmax(1) (U/mg) S0.5(2) (M) Vmax(2) (U/mg) kcat(1) (s­1) kcat(1)/S0.5(1) (M­1 s­1) kcat(2) (s­1) kcat(2)/S0.5(2) (M­1 s­1) CAT-1a 0.021 ± 0.002 2.04 × 106 ± 6.4 × 104 0.57 ± 0.023 3.4 × 106 ± 6.7 × 104 1.12 × 107 5.32 × 108 1.86 × 107 3.26 × 107 CAT-1e 0.051 ± 0.006 2.15 × 106 ± 1.1 × 105 0.81 ± 0.054 3.26 × 106 ± 1.1 × 105 1.18 × 107 2.31 × 108 1.78 × 107 2.20 × 107

respectively, of CAT-1a, and of 16.7 ± 2.3 and 21.1 ± 3.6 kcal/mole for CAT-1e. Thus, the local change at the active site promoted by oxidation did not significantly alter the kinetic constants nor the apparent activation energies of the reaction catalyzed by CAT-1e. 3.3. Effect of inhibitors on enzymes' activity Different catalase activity inhibitors were used to detect differences between the non-oxidized and the fully oxidized CAT-1. The irreversible specific inhibitor of catalases, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, at 20 mM, inactivated both CAT-1a and CAT-1e following pseudo-first order kinetics. The best fit gave estimated values for k of 0.054 ± 0.001 min­1 for CAT-1a and 0.052 ± 0.001 min­1 for CAT-1e. From these values, it was calculated that inhibition of 50% of the activity took place in 12.7 min for CAT-1a and 13.4 min for CAT-1e; these values are similar to the reported value for beef liver catalase [27]. Azide, another irreversible inhibitor of heme­enzymes, was effective at concentrations <1 mM. In this case, kinetics of inactivation was studied by incubating the enzymes with several concentrations of the inhibitor for a fixed time. Inactivation also was pseudo-first order and the experimental data fitted well to Eq. (4) (not shown). The estimated values for k were 2.11 ± 0.03 mM­1 min­1 for CAT-1a and of 1.83 ± 0.04 mM­1 min­1 for CAT-1e. The concentration of inhibitor producing 50% of inhibition after 1 min incubation with the enzyme, I50, was 330 µM for CAT-1a and 380 µM for CAT-1e. Inactivation kinetics by hydroxylamine, another irreversible inhibitor of catalases, were pseudo-first order with second-order rate constant, k, values of 3.54 ± 0.07 µM-1 min-1 for CAT-1a and of 3.32 ± 0.11 µM-1 min-1 for CAT-1e. The I50 for hydroxylamine after 1 min incubation was 0.19 µM for CAT-1a and of 0.20 µM for CAT-1e. Cyanide binds reversibly to heme­proteins. It is a noncompetitive inhibitor of catalases at low H2O2 concentrations and competitive at high (>0.1 M) H2O2 concentrations

3.2. Apparent activation energy of CAT-1 reaction The dependence of kcat on temperature was determined for the two enzymes. In the temperature range used, all initial velocity data fitted well to the double Hill equation, Eq. (1), with Hill numbers of 1.2 and 1.7 for the first and second component, respectively. Arrhenius plots (not shown) were linear and gave apparent activation energies of 19.6 ± 1.5 and 17.5 ± 6.2 kcal/mole for the first and second component,

Fig. 2. Differences in enzyme sensitivity to cyanide inhibition. KCN inhibited CAT-1 competitively with a Ki of 0.76 µM in the case of CAT-1a (n and solid line) and of 0.28 µM in the case of CAT-1e (· and dashed line). Data are the mean ± SEM of three separate determinations.

[30]. Inhibition of CAT-1 by KCN at micromolar concentrations was competitive even at the low H2O2 concentrations assayed (8­60 mM) (not shown). Replots of the apparent KM values, obtained in the presence of the inhibitor, vs. inhibitor concentration were linear, indicating total inhibition and non-cooperative binding of cyanide ion to the enzyme (Fig. 2). CAT-1e was more sensitive to KCN inhibition than CAT-1a: Ki = 0.76 ± 0.05 and 0.28 ± 0.03 µM, respectively. In conclusion, of the different inhibitors assayed, only KCN revealed a higher sensitivity in CAT-1e, which might be indicative of a local change at the active site of the oxidized enzyme. 3.4. pH effect on enzyme stability CAT-1e was less active than CAT-1a at the extreme pH values, 4­4.5, and 11.5­12 (Fig. 3A). Stability of the enzyme was assayed in the acid pH range. CAT-1e in the pH range from 4 to 6 was less stable than CAT-1a, while no difference was found at pH 7.8 (Fig. 3B). This is in accordance with data showing that CAT-1a remains active after native PAGE with an initial pH of 3.8; CAT-1e was inactivated under these conditions (not shown). Thus, a structural change in the oxidized CAT-1 turned the enzyme unstable at acidic pH. 3.5. Structural properties of CAT-1 To test if there is a gross conformational change in CAT1e, fluorescence emission spectra of CAT-1a and CAT-1e were recorded. The two enzymes exhibited an emission maximum at 334 nm. There were no differences between the oxidized and non-oxidized CAT-1 (not shown). We also recorded the circular dicroism spectra for both enzymes. We found a slight but not statistically significant decrease in the amount of a-helix in CAT-1e (16.60 ± 1.96) compared to CAT-1a (18.85 ± 1.89). Determination of

Data are the mean ± SEM of three separate determinations.

b-bands in CAT-1e (50.29 ± 3.50) and CAT-1a (46.19 ± 2.87) was not accurate enough to detect small differences between enzymes. Turns in CAT-1e (8.21 ± 0.83) and CAT-1a (9.18 ± 0.54) and random structure in CAT-1e (24.90 ± 1.58) and CAT-1a (25.78 ± 1.25) were also similar. Thus, the protein fluorescence and circular dicroism spectra did not reveal gross conformational differences between the oxidized and the non-oxidized CAT-1. Because we detected a site of singlet oxygen oxidation at the heme [19], we analyzed heme fluorescence in CAT-1a and CAT-1e. Due of the very high absorbency of the iron, a high concentration of protein was used to detect heme fluorescence. No significant differential fluorescence of a particular region was observed. 3.6. CAT-1 stability CAT-1 is very resistant to heat inactivation [16]. In an attempt to make evident a likely although minor structural change in CAT-1e, enzymes were incubated for 1 h at a high temperature (80­93 °C) and then analyzed by PAGE under non-denaturing conditions. Although a tetrameric conformation is detected in CAT-1 with cross-linking agents [16], we

detected only the dimeric form of the enzyme with native PAGE. The dimers are fully active while monomers are inactive. CAT-1e monomers were observed at a temperature of 85 °C and above, while CAT-1a monomers were observed at 90 °C and above (Fig. 4A), indicating a higher thermal stability of CAT-1a than CAT-1e. Treating catalase with guanidinium ion also revealed CAT-1 high resistance to denaturation [16]. Both enzymes conserved their activity after 48 h exposure to 3.5 M guanidine hydrochloride. At 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, CAT-1a still had some active dimers, while the entire CAT-1e was found as monomers (Fig. 4B) and no activity was detected. Thus, CAT-1a was more resistant than CAT-1e to dissociation with guanidinium ion. Sensitivity of CAT-1 to proteolysis was tested with subtilisin. Loss of enzyme activity in CAT-1e followed first order kinetics and occurred significantly faster (50% loss in 2.76 h)

than in CAT-1a (50% loss in 5.37 h) (Fig. 5A). In the first 30 min, subtilisin treatment of both enzymes generated partially digested but fully active dimers that contained polypeptides of 63 kDa when analyzed with SDS-PAGE; active polypeptides of even lower molecular mass (49­51 kDa) were revealed (Fig. 5B). Loss of the 63 kDa polypeptide, determined by densitometry of the Coomassie blue stained band, followed first order kinetics and was faster when derived from CAT-1e (50% loss in 4.3 h) than from CAT-1a (50% loss in 7.9 h) (Fig. 5C). Thus, kinetics of both loss of

activity and of the 63 kDa polypeptide were faster when derived from the CAT-1e than from CAT-1a. Hence, although there was no gross conformational modification in CAT-1e, a more subtle change in the enzyme became evident when exposed to high temperature, high concentration of guanidinium ion and proteolysis.

4. Discussion Functional and structural differences were detected between the fully oxidized enzyme, CAT-1e, and the nonoxidized one, CAT-1a. A local change at the active site has functional consequences as evidenced by an increased sensitive to KCN inhibition and slightly altered kinetic constants. The lower stability of CAT-1e in acidic pH and its lower resistance to high temperature, guanidinium ion, and subtilisin treatment indicate structural differences. Other data, such as inactivation by other catalase inhibitors, circular dicroism measurements, and protein and heme fluorescence spectra did not denote significant differences between the nonoxidized and the oxidized enzyme. 4.1. CAT-1 complex kinetics A double Hill equation accounts for CAT-1 kinetics in a two orders of magnitude-range of H2O2 concentration. Both, a Hill number of 1 or of 1.2 and 1.7 for the first and second component, respectively, gave good theoretical fits to the whole set of experimental data of both enzymes. The contribution of the second saturable component to the reaction velocity is negligible at H2O2 concentrations below 100 mM, but it starts to appreciably contribute at concentrations above 250 mM. Compared to CAT-1a, we found a small change in the two S0.5 values of CAT-1e, which might be indicative of a local change at the active site, but the kcat of both enzymes were similar. Some kinetic constants for CAT-1 (Table 1) differ from the reported ones for an inducible N. crassa catalase [31], that is probably a mixture of CAT-1 and CAT-3 [10]. A Km of 25 mM, similar to our S0.5(1) value of 21 mM, was obtained using a single substrate concentration, 14 mM, which is non-saturating for the first H2O2-saturation component of the CAT-1. However, from the kcat/Km of 4.6 × 106 M­1 s­1 we calculated a kcat of 0.12 × 106 s­1, which is 97 times less than the kcat determined for the first component of CAT-1a (Table 1). For Aspergillus niger CatR, reported Km values are 322 mM, using a H2O2-concentration range of 0.1­2 M [18] and 465 mM, using <400 mM concentrations [17], which are comparable to our S0.5(2) value of 570 mM. However, the reported kcat/Km values for CatR are 0.6 × 106 M-1 s­1 [17] and 7.5 × 106 M­1 s­1 [32], which are, respectively, 54 and 70 times smaller than the CAT-1 values (Table 1). The calculated kcat value from the reported kcat/Km and Km [17] is 2.79 × 105 s­1, 67 times smaller than our kcat(2) value. The different kinetic parameters of these and other reports compared to

those obtained for CAT-1a and CAT-1e could be due to both the different method used to obtain them, a non-linear fit to a two-component Hill equation in our case (Eq. (1)) and the extrapolation of 1/v vs. 1/[H2O2] in the other reports [17,31], and to the H2O2-concentration range used in the determination of the saturation kinetics. There are no Ea values reported for the catalytic steps to compare the apparent Ea values for kcat of CAT-1. There are however reports on the apparent Ea for H2O2 binding. Estimated from our Arrhenius plots of ln(kcat/S0.5) vs. 1/T, the apparent Ea for H2O2 binding were 4.2­6.8 kcal/mol for CAT-1a and 4.5­5.5 kcal/mol for CAT-1e. Compared to these values, the reported Ea of 7.2 kcal/mol for the above mentioned N. crassa catalase [31] is similar, and the Ea of 2.6 kcal/mol for CatR [32] is somewhat lower. The apparent Ea for the kcat values for both components of the saturation kinetics of CAT-1e are similar to those of CAT-1a, indicating that the transition state of the ratelimiting step in the catalyzed reaction, if there is one, is not importantly destabilized nor stabilized by oxidation of the enzyme. The similar Ea values for kcat/S0.5 also indicate no significant differences in the binding of substrate between the non-oxidized and oxidized CAT-1. Taken together, the enzymes show no important kinetic differences between them. Non-hyperbolic kinetics as those found here for CAT-1 could arise from different mechanisms. They can result from negative cooperativity between active sites in the same enzyme molecule or from the existence of active site heterogeneity, due to either asymmetry in one enzyme molecule or to different enzyme forms. However, there is no indication of isoenzymes in our enzyme preparation, and the enzyme that result from oxidation exhibits the same non-hyperbolic kinetics than the reduced enzyme. Therefore, heterogeneity of active sites, if this is the cause of the observed kinetics, does not arise from oxidation. Non-hyperbolic kinetics may have a kinetic origin. The reaction catalyzed by catalases involves the ordered addition of two substrate molecules, although both are H2O2. The chemical mechanism is consistent with a Ping-Pong kinetic mechanism where the product released in the first partial reaction is H2O, and H2O and O2 in the second one. In this kinetic mechanism, if any of the product-release steps is rate limiting, "substrate activation" can arise by an alternative and faster product release pathway involving the previous formation of an abortive ternary complex between the substrate and the enzyme­product complex. This would also give nonhyperbolic kinetics as those observed in CAT-1. This kinetic mechanism can result in substrate inhibition, if the release of the product from the abortive ternary complex enzyme­ product­substrate is slower than that from the binary complex enzyme­product, which could be related to the substrate inhibition observed with small catalases. However, substrate inhibition in small catalases was explained by the formation of inactive compound II and III [18]. Because the narrow channel that conveys H2O2 to the heme has a gate system [23], it can be considered as a part of the active site and by

regulating H2O2 accessibility to the heme with H2O2 concentration it could explain the observed non-hyperbolic kinetics and cooperativity. Our results do not allow us to conclude whether the complex H2O2 saturation kinetics of CAT-1, and most likely the similar kinetics exhibited by other large catalases [17,18], are due to (i) negative cooperativity between interacting active sites, (ii) the existence of two kinds of active sites, or (iii) have a kinetic origin. Whatever the reason for these complex kinetics, it is clear that CAT-1, and the other large catalases, have evolved a mechanism which enables them to catalyze the dismutation of very high H2O2 concentrations with catalytic efficiencies only one order of magnitude smaller than those attained at low H2O2 concentrations. 4.2. Local change at the heme CAT-1e is more sensitive to cyanide than CAT-1a. Because cyanide binds to the heme, these differences indicate a modification at the active site. In an E. coli HPII mutant enzyme, with a substitution of the active site asparagine (N201) for alanine or glutamine, only small changes in cyanide affinity were observed. However, upon modification of heme b to heme d, binding of cyanide to the active site increases [33]. Thus, oxidation of the porphyrin ring in HPII and in CAT-1 can affect sensitivity to cyanide. Compared to other large catalases, A. niger CatR and E. coli HPII, CAT-1 sensitivity was much more than HPII and CatR to cyanide, less to azide, and similar to hydroxylamine [17]. 4.3. Stability of CAT-1 The stability of CAT-1 is remarkable. Global structure remains the same after half an hour at 90 °C and 48 h in 3.5 M guanidine hydrochloride without loss of activity. CAT-1 is more stable than other catalases [16]. Stability of CAT-1 is probably related to conidium endurance. Conidia are formed as a response to oxidative stress [12,14,15]. They also have to contend during germination with a high concentration of H2O2 from plant substrates that can have active NADPH oxidase and produces large amounts of H2O2 [34]. The high concentration of CAT-1 in conidia (0.6% of total protein) and its endurance to denaturation and resistance to high concentration of H2O2 enables the survival and germination of the conidium under adverse conditions. In fact, conidia of an Aspergillus nidulans mutant strain in the homologous catalase are sensitive to H2O2 [5] and termolabile [35]. CAT-1e is less stable than CAT-1a at high temperature, at 4 M guanidinium ion, or at acidic pH. This indicates that changes produced by oxidation make the enzyme less stable only under extreme conditions. These results are in accordance with the lack of gross alterations of the protein structure as indicated by protein fluorescence and circular dicroism. As singlet oxygen reacts rapidly with amino acid residues, particularly Trp, Tyr, His, Met, and Cys, in addition to the

heme ring, damage to other residues in the protein is probable. These changes may be heterogeneous and present at a low level and hence be difficult to detect in the crystal structure. Such protein damage could be the cause of the enhanced protein instability. Because the protein N-terminus is buried in the central part of the tetramer and is essential for activity and stability of the dimer [36], digestion of the N-terminus by subtilisin without loss of enzyme activity is limited to a loose end. In fact, only 14 amino acids were cut as determined by N-terminal sequencing (not shown). Thus, to give an active 63 kDa polypeptide, proteolysis of the protein has to occur at the C-terminus. Because the increased instability to subtilisin took place after the subunits were processed to the active 63 kDa polypeptide, these results suggest that the CAT-1e increased instability does not reside at the C-terminus. The resulting active enzyme would be similar to the small catalases with a mass of 60 kDa. Even smaller polypeptides (49­51 kDa) still gave active dimers (Fig. 5B). 4.4. Physiological and evolutionary implications of heme oxidation Oxidation of the heme in catalases is probably inevitable. Because of the extremely high catalytic efficiency of catalases, O2 is generated at a rate of millions of molecules per second when concentrations of H2O2 are high. Under these conditions, catalytic singlet oxygen formation is highly probable. Besides, another source of singlet oxygen is light. Porphyrins are excited by blue light and O2 can absorb this energy to form singlet oxygen. Thus, O2 at the active site could form singlet oxygen by photosensitization. The selectivity of singlet oxygen for the site of attack in the porphyrin could be related to the exit pathway of dioxygen [23]. Singlet oxygen could also diffuse to the active site through the channels used to evacuate catalytic O2. This occurs when cells are under conditions in which singlet oxygen is produced and catalase is oxidized in vivo [20,22]. It also happens when purified CAT-1 is oxidized with a pure source of singlet oxygen [19]. Under most physiological conditions, CAT-1e would be as efficient as CAT-1a. The differences in enzyme structure could only result in an increased turnover rate of the oxidized enzyme [20]. Because of its important role as antioxidant enzymes, and inasmuch as oxidation appears to be unavoidable, catalase could have been selected through evolution to remain active even when oxidized at its active site. In fact, preservation of functional and structural catalase properties in the oxidized form could be important for microbial survival.
