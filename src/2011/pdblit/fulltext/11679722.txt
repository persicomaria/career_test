A new conformation of the integrin-binding fragment of human VCAM-1 crystallizes in a highly hydrated packing arrangement
An X-ray crystal structure of two N-terminal integrin-binding IgSF domains of human VCAM-1 is reported. This new crystal form shows an unusual and highly hydrated packing arrangement in which over 80% of the crystal is occupied by solvent. The relative orientations of the two domains adopt a new intermediate conformation. The tilt angle between the two domains is 19.4 , compared with other related structures that have tilt angles ranging from 7.3 to 39.9 . An analysis of the torsion angles shows that residues Ile88, Tyr89, Ser90, Pro92 and Glu96 play a major role in de®ning the interdomain conformations.

1. Introduction
Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1/CDM8; Osborn et al., 1989; INCAM-110; Rice et al., 1990) is a cell-surface receptor molecule that represents an integrin-binding subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF; Wang et al., 1995). VCAM-1 preferentially binds the integrin heterodimer of the very late antigen (VLA-4) 1 family (Wang & Springer, 1998) containing 4 (CD49d) and 1 (CD29) subunits (Vonderheide & Springer, 1992). The VCAM-1± integrin interaction mediates intercellular adhesion of leukocytes to the blood-vessel wall (Osborn et al., 1989) and also regulates trans-endothelial emigration at in¯ammatory sites (Wang & Springer, 1998). VCAM-1 may also act as a host receptor for viruses and parasites (Huber, 1994), as well as having important implications in tumour formation and metastasis (Rice et al., 1990). The extracellular region of VCAM-1 typically consists of seven contiguously arranged IgSF domains (VCAM-7D; Chothia & Jones, 1997) that adopt an extended rod-like structure (Osborn et al., 1994). Ligand-binding surfaces speci®c to VLA-4 integrin are exposed on homologous IgSF domains 1 and 4 of VCAM-7D (Wang & Springer, 1998). X-ray crystal structures are available for a functional ligandbinding fragment of domains 1 and 2 of VCAM-1 (Jones et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1995, 1996) and ligand-binding domains of related immune-cell adhesion molecules of the subfamily, including ICAM-1 (Casasnovas et al., 1998; Bella et al., 1998), ICAM-2 (Casasnovas et al., 1997), MAdCAM-1 (Tan et al., 1998), CD2 (Jones et al., 1992; Bodian et al., 1994) and CD4 (Brady et al., 1993; Ryu et al., 1994). Here, we present a novel crystal form of VCAM-1 that adopts a different conformation and exists in an exceptionally highly hydrated packing arrangement.

Puri®ed protein was a gift from Dr P. Lake. Crystals were grown at room temperature using the hanging-drop method and could be obtained using either polyethylene glycol or ammonium sulfate as the precipitant. Large hexagonal crystals used for data collection were obtained from 10 ml hanging drops. These drops comprised 5 ml of protein solution (10 mg mlÀ1 in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5) added to a 5 ml drop of well solution [50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.1, 42%(v/v) saturated ammonium sulfate].
2.2. Structure determination

A summary of the crystallographic data is given in Table 1. Crystals of dimensions 1.0 Â 1.0 Â 0.8 mm were mounted in thin glass Lindemann tubes. X-ray data were collected at room temperature using a MAR image plate and processed using DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1993). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994), with one domain of the VCAM structure as the model (Jones et al., 1995). Positional and B-factor re®neÈ ment were performed using X-PLOR Version 3.1 (Brunger, 1993); water molecules were placed on appropriate peaks in subsequent difference Fourier maps.

Aqueous stock solutions of Ficoll 400 (Pharmacia) were made up at 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10%(w/w). Aliquots of approximately 40 ml were layered into a glass tube with an internal diameter of 2 mm. The gradient was calibrated using 5 ml drops of water-saturated chloroform/toluene mixtures. The calibration solutions were saturated with water and their density was measured using a 10 ml pycnometer to an esti-

mated accuracy of 0.001 g mlÀ1. The tube with the calibration droplets was spun at 4000g for 5 min.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. X-ray structure and solvent channels

Figure 1

Statistics for the re®ned structure are given in Table 1. The packing diagram for this form of VCAM (Fig. 1) shows a Ê spectacularly large solvent channel with VM = 3.44 A3 DaÀ1 and over 80% of the crystal being occupied by solvent. In order to show that lack of electron density in the crystal channels was indeed arising from solvent and not disordered VCAM, density measurements of the crystal using the Ficoll method were carried out. The single crystal of VCAM which had been used for X-ray intensity measurements was introduced onto the top of the Ficoll gradient tube and within 30 s sank to a point corresponding to a crystal density (d) of 1.12 g cmÀ3. After centrifugation for 5 min at 4000g the crystal sank to a point corresponding to 1.135 g cmÀ3. The crystal continued to drop in the gradient tube until stabilizing after about 60 min with an apparent density of 1.17 g cmÀ3. This increase of crystal density with time has been commonly observed (Dragovich et al., 1996; Borgstahl et al., 1996) and is attributed to the incorporation of Ficoll into the lattice.

The structure of VCAM-1 is orientated to reveal the extensive integrinbinding surface. The key residues involved in basal levels of integrin binding (cyan; Gln38, Ile39, Asp40, Ser41, Pro42, Leu43, Leu70, Thr72, Glu87) map to the protruding CD loop and nearby F and G strands of domain 1. Residues that form speci®c 41 and 47 integrin contacts (purple; Lys79, Leu80, Glu81, Lys82, Asp143, Ser148, Glu150, Lys152 and Glu155) reside in domains 1 and domain 2, respectively. The linker peptide (blue) connects Ig domains 1 and 2. Key linker residues (yellow; Ile88, Tyr89, Ser90, Phe91, Pro92 and Glu96) proposed to mediate interdomain movement are shown.

Each of the ®ve VCAM-1 monomers were superimposed with exclusion of residues 140±149 (CH E loop) and 176±185 (FG loop) to give a structural overlay of domain 2 backbone atoms. The domain 2 overlay of available VCAM-1 X-ray structures demonstrates the rigid-body motion of domain 1 relative to domain 2.

phobic interface of domains 1 and 2. The average B factor of Ê Ê 42.0 A2 (s.d. 18.6 A2) for main-chain atoms in this structure solved at room temperature is rather high (Table 1) and only 50 solvent molecules were located. Despite this, the linker region (residues 88±96) between the two domains is rather Ê well de®ned and has an average main-chain B factor of 36.4 A2 Ê 2) and slightly more mobile side chains with an (s.d. 4.51 A Ê Ê average B factor of 40.4 A2 (s.d. 12.1 A2). All 9 and 2 angles of this linker are found to lie within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The analysis of dihedral angles measured from all available structural results (Table 2) suggests that interdomain ¯exibility is not uniquely determined by the 9,2 angles of any one linker residue but is rather determined by changes in the conformation of some or all of the residues in the sequence Ile88±Glu96. In particular, Ile88, Tyr89, Ser90, Pro92 and Glu96 play a major role. The 9 angle of Ser90 of À128.5 for the new VCAM-1 form varies considerably from the narrow range of values obtained for the other crystal forms (À144.3 to À149.6 ). The 9 and 2 rotation angles of Pro92 of À66.7 and À45.5 , respectively, both deviate from values obtained for the other four monomers (Table 2). Previous analyses attributed interdomain ¯exibility to changes in the conformation of the pivot residue Tyr89 (Wang et al., 1995) or Ile88, Pro92 and Glu96 (Jones et al., 1995). A least-squares ®t of main-chain atoms of domain 2 (residues 96±196) provides an optimized structural alignment for each of the ®ve crystallographically independent VCAM-1 structures (Table 3; Fig. 3). The `tilt' angle between the domains (Table 2) is calculated as the angle between the two lines de®ning the principal axes for each of the domains (Bork et al., 1996). The tilt angle is essentially two-dimensional and, in association with the `skew' angle, de®nes the orientation of the domains. The tilt and skew values obtained for the VCAM structure presented here (19.4 , 77.7 ) lie between the tilt (7.3±39.9 ) and skew (55.3±87.8 ) angles measured for the other four monomers. The VCAM structure reported here adopts a unique conformation, as evident from the tilt and skew angles which demonstrate projection of domain 1 with respect to domain 2. This orientation provides an intermediate VCAM conformation that facilitates interaction of domain 1 with both the ¯exible CH E and FG loops of domain 2. The torsion angles of the linker residues may in part be governed by the interdomain contacts. Indeed, the leastsquares ®t of the domains of each of the ®ve structures shows that there are large differences in the conformations of the longer FG and CH E loops (Table 3). The inherently mobile CH E and FG loops located at the hydrophobic interface of Ig domains 1 and 2 are likely to change conformation in order to accommodate any changes in the relative positions of domains 1 and 2 (Chothia & Jones, 1997).

Mutagenesis experiments revealed the general integrinbinding motif of VCAM-1 as the sequence Q38IDSPL located on the loop connecting -strands C1 and D1 of the ®rst domain of VCAM-1 (Fig. 2; Newham et al., 1997). Asp40 is a key integrin-binding residue located at the tip of the CD loop. It provides a negative charge that may complete a divalent cation-binding site in the counter-receptor molecule (Jones et al., 1995). Mutagenesis studies have implicated the sequence G64NEH exposed on the EF loop in 4 integrin binding to domain 1 of VCAM-1 (Osborn et al., 1994). The EF loop of domain 1 lies in close proximity to the CD loop to form a general integrin-presenting surface (Wang et al., 1996) positioned near the interface of domains 1 and 2 (Wang et al., 1995). Mutational analysis provides the ®rst evidence for the existence of CH E loop±integrin interactions (Newham et al., 1997) that support ®ndings of VCAM-1 interdomain contacts. Residues of the CH E loop (Asp143, Ser148) and E -strand (Glu150, Lys152 and Glu155) create a negatively charged surface required for speci®c binding to 47 integrin. Sequence analysis suggests equivalent negatively charged residues are a common requirement for 47 binding to VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 (Newham et al., 1997). Speci®c integrin binding of 41 to VCAM-1 maps to residues K(79)LEK that reside in the G -strand of domain 1 (Kilger et al., 1997) (Fig. 2). The structural data presented here provides further insight into the mechanism of adhesive interactions in the Ig subfamily of integrin-binding proteins. The conformation of our X-ray crystal structure demonstrates interdomain motion stabilized by the extensive loops of domain 2. We thank Dr P. Lake from Sandoz AG for providing protein.
