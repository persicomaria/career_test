Summary Background: c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) plays a critical role in UV-induced apoptotic cell death. Although three isoforms are known in mammals, physiological roles of each isoform are still obscure. Furthermore, our recent findings show that serpin squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA1) binds to JNK. Objective: To determine which isoform is responsible for the UV signal transduction in human epidermis and whether SCCA1 is capable to regulate kinase activity of a specific isoform. Methods: Immunohistochemical localization of each JNK isoform was investigated after UV irradiation in vivo and in vitro. Effect of recombinant SCCA1 on JNK kinase activity was also analyzed. Results: Immunostaining for JNK1, 2 and 3 demonstrated marked elevation of JNK1 in spinous to granular cells of UV-irradiated skin, whereas they were expressed weakly in upper epidermis of the sun-protected, buttock skin. In cultured keratinocytes, only JNK1 is translocated into nucleus after UV irradiation. JNK2, which localized in the cytoplasm, or JNK3, which was confined in nucleus, remained in the same compartment after UV irradiation. We confirmed that only JNK1 mRNA was up-regulated after UV irradiation in cultured keratinocytes. In addition, recombinant SCCA1 suppressed kinase activity of JNK1 but did not affect JNK2 or JNK3 kinase activity. Conclusion: JNK1 is associated with UV signal transduction in human epidermis and SCCA1 is a suppressor of this process. # 2006 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

1. Introduction
Keratinocytes undergo terminal differentiation in order to form protective barrier, called cornified layer against hazardous environment. UV irradiation is a typical cytotoxic stress that should be treated adequately in view of both cell survival and cell death. UV irradiation induces various cellular responses that are regulated by a protein kinase signaling cascade [1]. It is mediated through stressactivated protein kinases called SAPKs [2]. c-Jun aminoterminal kinase (JNK) is one of the kinds, which targets specific transcription factors such as c-Jun, ATF-2 and NFkB [3]. Cloning of JNK revealed three genes, JNK1--JNK3, and many splicing variants [4--6]. JNK contributes to UV responses including survival and apoptosis depending on cell types and the duration of phosphorylation [7]. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) was first discovered as a marker of squamous cell carcinomas of cervix [8,9]. SCCA belongs to the serpin superfamily and two different, but nearly identical gene products, SCCA1 and SCCA2, are known in humans [10]. Our recent study revealed that SCCAs are strongly up-regulated in the upper epidermis of sun-exposed skin as well as the skin after UV irradiation [11]. Furthermore, UV-induced apoptosis was significantly decreased when SCCA was overexpressed and significantly increased when SCCA was down-regulated. It is strongly suggested that SCCA1 binds to JNK1, resulting in the co-translocation into nucleus. Thus it seems likely that SCCA plays a protective role against UV irradiation in keratinocytes via the suppression of JNK. However, distinct action of individual JNK isoforms or functions of JNK isoforms in keratinocytes are largely unknown. Here we report that among three JNK isoforms, only JNK1 responds to the UV irradiation in mRNA and protein levels. UV irradiation induced translocation of JNK1 into nucleus but not of JNK2 or JNK3. Furthermore, SCCA1 suppressed the kinase activity of JNK1 but had little effect on other JNKs. These findings indicate that JNK1 is responsible for UV signal transduction in keratinocytes.

2.2. Volunteers
Five healthy Japanese volunteers (age, 26--45) were participated in this study after the approval from the Shiseido Committee of Human Ethics. All subjected to this study, after being informed of its research aims and procedures. Human face skin specimens were obtained with informed consent from plastic surgery patients at the Institute of Aoyama Women's Medicine of Tokyo Women's Medical University. This study was approved by the Committee of Ethical Matters at the Tokyo Women's Medical University.

2.3. UVB irradiation
Irradiation with two minimum erhythematous dose (MED) of UVB was performed on the buttock of each volunteer, utilizing a trans-illuminator TOREX FL205E-30/DMR (Toshiba Medical Supply). After 48 h of UV irradiation, 5 mm punch biopsies were taken from each volunteer. As a control, unexposed skin of other side of buttock was also sampled from each volunteer. Keratinocytes were irradiated at 60--70% confluent condition emitting UVB at 0--50 mJ/cm2.

2.4. Cell culture
Human keratinocytes were obtained from Kurabo Biomedicals (Osaka, Japan) and cultured in EpiLife (Kurabo) with supplements.

2.5. JNK kinase assay
Kinase activity of JNK was determined using SAPK/ JNK Assay Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inhibition of JNK kinase activity by SCCA1 was assessed using phosphorylated-JNK1a1/SAPK1c or phosphorylated-JNK2a2/SAPK1a (Upstate, Waltham, MA). Phosphorylated JNK, c-Jun fusion beads and SCCA1 were incubated with gentle rocking overnight at 4 8C. The phosphorylated c-Jun was separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody (1:1000 dilution).

2. Materials and methods

3. Results
3.1. JNK1 is up-regulated in UV-exposed skin.
We compared the localization of each JNK isoform in three different conditions including unexposed buttock skin (control), UV-irradiated buttock skin and sun-exposed cheek skin. In the unexposed buttock skin, relatively low level of JNK1 was detected from basal to granular cells (Fig. 1). JNK2 was almost undetectable. JNK3 showed positive staining in the

Two MED of UVB were irradiated on the other side of the control site (UVirradiated) and biopsies were taken after 48 h. Biopsy samples from cheeks were used as sun-exposed skin. Skin samples were fixed with PFA and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for JNK isoforms. Note up-regulation of JNK1 in the upper epidermis of UV irradiated and sun-exposed skin.

Interestingly some of the nuclei of the granular cells were strongly positive for JNK1. JNK2 staining was unchanged and remained undetectable after UVirradiation. Slight increase of immunostaining was noticed for JNK3 in the entire epidermis, however, changes of JNK3 remained in low level compared to JNK1. In the sun-exposed skin, JNK1 showed elevated expression in the granular layer as seen in the UV-irradiated epidermis. JNK2 was again undetectable. JNK3 also showed relatively strong staining in the granular layer. These results clearly suggest that among three isoforms, only JNK1 is responding against the UV irradiation.

3.3. JNK1 is translocated into nucleus after UV irradiation
In cultured human keratinocytes, analysis with confocal microscopy demonstrated that JNK1 was present both in cytoplasm and in nucleus (Fig. 3). When proliferating keratinocytes were stained with anti-JNK1 antibody, we found that JNK1 was distributed in the cytoplasm as well as nucleus. With 50 mJ/cm2 of UVB irradiation onto the culture, translocation of JNK1 was observed at most of keratinocytes. Majority of JNK1 was concentrated into the nuclei or accumulated in the peripheral regions of nucleus.

3.4. JNK2 localizes in cytoplasm even after UVB irradiation
Although JNK2 was almost undetectable in the normal epidermis, it was expressed in the cytoplasm of cultured keratinocytes (Fig. 4). Interestingly UVB irradiation did not show any effect on the localization of JNK2. JNK2 remained in cytoplasm even after the treatment with 10, 30 and 50 mJ/cm2 of UVB irradiation (results shown at 50 mJ/cm2 irradiation). These results indicate distinct responsiveness of JNK2 compared to JNK1.

3.2. Localization of p-JNKs after UV irradiation
We then examined the localization of p-JNK1 in the human skin in order to assess whether JNK1 is activated after UV irradiation. First we checked the specificity of anti-p-JNK1 antibody (DB066, Delta Biolabs) using each recombinant protein of JNK pro-forms and phosphorylated JNKs. Although Western blot analysis demonstrated that DB066 did not react with any pro-forms, it did recognized all the phosphorylated forms, p-JNK1, p-JNK2 and pJNK3 (unpublished data). Since it failed to distinguish each isoform of p-JNK, we decided to compare localization of JNK1 and p-JNKs. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated nuclear staining of p-JNKs in the granular layer where heavy staining of JNK1 was found in the sun-exposed skin (Fig. 2). In the sun-protected skin, p-JNKs were hardly detectable. Since only JNK1 was up-regulated in the upper epidermis of the sun-exposed skin (Fig. 1), nuclear staining of p-JNKs with this antibody clearly suggests activation of JNK1 in the same area.

3.5. JNK3 localizes in nucleus and remains in the same
JNK3 was found mostly in the nucleus of the proliferating keratinocytes (Fig. 5). The nuclear localization of JNK3 did not change after the UVB irradiation. Constitutive localization of JNK3 in nucleus may suggest a role for this isozyme in keratinocyte proliferation. It was also clear that JNK3 does not respond to UV stress either like JNK2, although they showed distinct localization each other.

3.6. JNK1 mRNA is up-regulated after UVB irradiation
Effect of mRNA expression of each JNK isoform was examined after UVB irradiation (Fig. 6). Semi-quantitative PCR demonstrated that JNK1 mRNA was expressed relatively low level compared to JNK2 or JNK3. JNK1 mRNA decreased at 3 h after irradiation and strongly up-regulated at 15 h. After 24 h of UVB irradiation, it markedly decreased and was

hardly detectable at 48 h. JNK2 showed considerable expression in the same condition. JNK3 was most strongly expressed in proliferating keratinocytes. JNK2 as well as JNK3 mRNA showed similar changes. They were highly expressed up to 3 h and dropped to very low levels at 15 h and thereafter. Our results indicate that all three isoforms are expressed in human keratinocytes and mRNA expression of JNK isoforms is differentially regulated depending on its isoform. Furthermore, we confirmed that in the mRNA expression level, UV irradiation induced transient up-regulation of JNK1, however, it showed only suppressive effect on the expression of JNK2 and JNK3.

3.7. SCCA1 inhibits JNK1 kinase activity
Since our previous study indicated interaction between SCCA1 and JNK1 during the UV signal transduction [11], we further tested that SCCA1 could affect the kinase activity of other JNKs. We examined whether c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK isoforms is affected by SCCA1, using in vitro kinase assays. In the presence of SCCA1, JNK1 activity on cJun phosphorylation was significantly reduced (Fig. 7). In contrast, kinase activity of JNK2 was not affected by SCCA1 at all. Similarly JNK3 activity remained unchanged in the presence of SCCA1. Collectively our results reveal that SCCA1 functions

Human keratinocytes were cultured to ca. 60% confluency and mRNA was prepared at appropriate times after emitting UVB at 50 mJ/cm2. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed using specific primer sets for JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3. G3PDH was used as a control.

177 irradiation induced translocation of JNK1 into nucleus. This phenomenon was not observed for JNK2 or JNK3 either. In addition, our immunohistochemical study suggests that JNK1 would be activated in the nuclei of the upper epidermis in response to UVB as judged by a distinct localization between JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3. JNK1 but not JNK2 is essential for TNFa-induced JNK activation and apoptosis [15]. Furthermore, analysis of mRNA expression demonstrated that JNK1 mRNA was first down-regulated at 3 h and then highly up-regulated at 15 h after UV-irradiation, whereas JNK2 or JNK3 mRNA was down-regulated without any recovery. On the other hand, Ramaswamy et al. [16] reported that activation of JNK1 in response to UVB irradiation occurred very rapidly within 1 min, peaked by 10 min in a keratinocyte cell line, C50. It would not be absurd to postulate that activation of JNK1 may trigger synthesis of JNK1, since consumption of JNK1 would be a serious threat for the appropriate response to UV irradiation. Our results strongly support that JNK1 is responsible for the UV signal transduction in human epidermis. JNK2 is essential in the TPA-driven tumor promotion process [17]. Primary murine fibroblasts isolated from Jnk1 (À/À) and Jnk2 (À/À) showed differential gene expression profiles [18], reflecting susceptibility to tumorigenesis of each animal model. A distinct role of JNK2 was also reported in transforming early to long-term potentiation [19]. Our results show that JNK2 is almost undetectable in normal human epidermis. It is expressed in the cultured keratinocytes as shown by immunocytostaining and RT-PCR analysis. However, mRNA expression of JNK2 is down-regulated with UVB. UVB irradiation did not affect JNK2 localization in cultured keratinocytes. It is appropriate to speculate that JNK2 would not be involved in UV signal transduction in human epidermis. JNK3 plays a critical role in a classic model of cellautonomous programmed neuron death [20]. Disruption of the JNK3 gene showed resistance to hippocampal neuron apoptosis [21]. Although studies with JNK3 have been limited to brain and neurons, apparently JNK3 is involved in an apoptotic pathway. JNK3 protein was detected in the entire epidermis, however, relatively strong staining was observed after UV irradiation on the buttock skin. Cultured keratinocytes demonstrated that JNK3 was mostly localized in the nuclei. Furthermore, single dose of UV irradiation did not show any effect on cellular localization of JNK3. These results may indicate a role of JNK3 in keratinocyte proliferation but not in the cell death pathway. In psoriasis, markedly increased active phospho-JNK was found

as a distinct inhibitor of JNK1, which is the only isoform responsible for UV signal transduction.

4. Discussion
Considering the hazardous effects of UV, epidermis has to be the primary barrier to protect our body. Recent evidence suggests that UV signal transduction is mediated via SAPKs such as JNKs and p38. We have already demonstrated that overexpression of SCCA1 was enough to suppress UV-induced cell death in vivo and in vitro [11]. Our analyses of the molecular mechanism revealed that SCCA1 interacted with JNK1 and suppressed its kinase activity. In this study we tried to elucidate the role of JNK isoforms in UV signal transduction in human keratinocytes. It is important to distinguish each JNK action, since JNK is implicated in diverse signaling events and thus in plethora of physiological functions. Furthermore, it is interesting to see how much SCCA1 is responsible for the regulation of each JNK activity. JNK regulates several transcription factors including c-Jun, ATF-2, ELK-1, p53 and c-Myc. It is suggested that different JNK isoforms share some functions, however, at the same time, they contribute to the different physiological functions. JNK1, but not JNK2, is essential for TNFa-induced c-Jun activation [13]. JNK1 is required for maintaining the cytoskeletal integrity of neuronal cells [14]. In human epidermis, we found that strong upregulation of JNK1 was detected in the upper layer of UV-irradiated skin. JNK2 or JNK3 did not show such strong increase after UV irradiation. Some of the nuclei were clearly positive for JNK1, showing translocation of JNK1 after UV irradiation. This was confirmed using cultured keratinocytes. UV

We also found that JNK3 was localized at the lower part of the psoriatic epidermis and many of JNK3-positive cells were also positive for PCNA (unpublished data). JNK3 may be associated with the keratinocyte proliferation. Although the role of the JNK pathway in apoptosis has been highly controversial, suggesting that it plays a pro-apoptotic, or anti-apoptotic in this process, JNK1 seems to be essential in UV-induced apoptotic cell death [23]. In the present study we have demonstrated that SCCA1 can suppress kinase activity of JNK1 but cannot affect JNK2 or JNK3 activity. The fact that SCCA1 is highly specific to JNK1 prefers a role of SCCA1 in UV signal transduction. Indeed involucrin promoter-driven SCCA1 transgenic mouse showed remarkable resistance against UV-induced keratinocyte apoptosis [11]. Precise suppression mechanism of UV-induced cell death has remained still obscure. JNKs are activated with upstream kinases, SEK1(MKK4) and MKK7 [2,24]. These mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) are present at both cytoplasm as well as nucleus and change localization under activation stimuli [25,26]. The induction of JNK activity results in the activation of proto-oncogene c-Jun and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcriptional activity and importantly it is correlated with UV-induced apoptosis [27]. Since SCCA1 can suppress JNK1 kinase activity, JNK1 would not be active in the nucleus when sufficient amount of SCCA1 is present. This will result in the inhibition of the transcription activity of c-Jun

C. Katagiri et al. and thus leads to the suppression of UV-induced apoptosis as illustrated in Fig. 8. The present study provides a basis for understanding the roles of JNK isoforms and novel UV protection mechanism in human epidermis.
