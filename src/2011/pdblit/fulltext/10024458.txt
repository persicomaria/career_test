MENON,

Introduction An early study with Pyrococcus furiosus showed that growth of this hyperthermophilic archaeon is stimulated by the addition of tungsten to the medium. 1 Subsequently, three distinct tungsten-containing enzymes were purified from this and related organisms. They are aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR), which has been purifed from P. furiosus, 2 Pyrococcus strain ES-4, 3 and Thermococcus strain ES-1, 4 formaldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (FOR), which has been purified from Thermococcus litoralis5 and P. furiosus, 6 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (GAPOR), which has been obtained so far only from P. furiosus. 7 All three enzymes catalyze the oxidation of various types of aldehyde using ferredoxin (Fd) as the physiological electron acceptor [Eq. (1), where Fdox and Fdred are the oxidized and reduced forms]. R C H O + H20 + 2Fdox ~ R C O O H + 2H + + 2Fdrea (1)

The three aldehyde-oxidizing enzymes differ in their substrate specificities. A O R oxidizes a wide range of both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to the corresponding acids, and it has been proposed that such aldehydes are derived from amino acids during peptide fermentation. 4 F O R has a more limited substrate range and oxidizes C5-C6 di- and semialdehydes and C1-C3 aldehydesJ '6 Various C 4 - C 6 semialdehydes are involved in the metabolism of some amino acids, such as Arg, Lys, and Pro, 8'9 suggesting that F O R may function in the catabolism of one or more of these amino acids. GAPOR, however, specifically oxidizes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

yielding 3-phosphoglycerate. This is a key enzyme in the sugar fermentation pathway, v,l° AOR, FOR, and G A P O R are members of one of three distinct groups of tungsten-containing enzymes known as the " A O R family." All of them consist of a single type of subunit of approximately 67 kDa in size, and their amino acid sequences show high sequence similarity, u The crystal structures of both A O R and F O R from P. furiosus have been determined and show that their tertiary structures are very similar) 2'13 Each subunit contains a mononuclear tungsten coordinated by four dithiolene sulfur atoms from two pterin molecules, together with a single [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated by four sulfur atoms from four cysteine residues. The overall sequence similarity between structurally uncharacterized G A P O R from P. furiosus and A O R / F O R (50% similarity) is lower than that between A O R and F O R (61%). Nevertheless, the amino acid residues involved in binding the pterins and the four cysteines coordinating the iron-sulfur cluster in A O R and F O R are conserved in GAPOR, indicating that G A P O R also contains a tungstobispterin cofactor and a single [4Fe-4S] cluster. 6'1° The three enzymes do differ, however, in their quaternary structures. G A P O R is thought to be monomeric, A O R is dimeric, and FOR exists as a tetramer. In addition to these three tungsten-containing enzymes that have been characterized from P. furiosus, the genome sequence of this organism contains two additional genes, wor4 and wor5, which are also thought to encode tungstoenzymes. 6 WOR4 and WOR5 have predicted molecular weights comparable to those of AOR, FOR, and G A P O R and show high sequence similarity to them, although as yet there is no indication as to the function of these putative enzymes. This article describes the purification of AOR, FOR, and G A P O R from P. furiosus and summarizes some of their properties. Assay Methods The activities of AOR, FOR, and G A P O R are assayed routinely by the conversion of various aldehydes to the corresponding acid. Although ferredoxin is the proposed physiological electron carrier, the artificial dye benzyl viologen (BV) is used more conveniently in the assays. Aldehyde oxidation is monitored by BV reduction, which can be easily measured

spectrophotometricaUy at 600 nm by the appearance of blue color. Strictly anaerobic conditions must be maintained during the assay as reduced benzyl viologen is instantly oxidized by oxygen and the enzymes themselves are irreversibly inactivated by oxygen (see later).

Reagents
The following stock solutions are prepared in 100 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-3-propanesulfonic acid, EPPS) buffer, pH 8.4. Benzyl viologen, 100 mM Sodium dithionite (DT), 100 mM Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, 88 mM (for G A P O R ) Formaldehyde, 1.5 M (for FOR) Crotonaldehyde, 1.0 M (for A O R ) EPPS buffer is prepared from a 1.0 M stock solution. The buffer is degassed thoroughly on a vacuum manifold and flushed with argon. Appropriate amounts of BV and DT are weighed out in powder form and degassed in empty 8-ml serum-stoppered vials before EPPS is added by syringe under argon. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, formaldehyde, and crotonaldehyde are degassed in the liquid form in the vial prior to adding buffer.

Procedure
A serum-stoppered cuvette containing 2 ml of anaerobic 100 mM EPPS buffer (pH 8.4) under argon is incubated for 3 rain at 70 ° (for G A P O R ) or 80° (for A O R and FOR) in a Spectronic 500 (Fisher Scientific, Atlanta, GA) spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cuvette holder and a thermoinsulated cell compartment. To this is added 50/zl of 100 mM BV. At this point it is important to make sure that the assay solution is anaerobic. This is done by adding a few microliters of DT (100 mM) by syringe. This should turn the solution a light blue color (reduced BV), indicating no oxygen contamination. The cell-free extract or enzyme and the aldehyde substrate are then added with thorough mixing after each addition. The final substrate concentrations for GAPOR, AOR, and F O R are 250/xM, 200/xM, and 50 mM, respectively. Benzyl viologen reduction is measured by the increase in visible absorption at 600 nm. Enzyme activity for all three enzymes is calculated from the initial rate of BV reduction, which is measured over a period of 30 sec or less, using a molar absorbance of 7400 M -I cm-1. 6 Assays are performed at 80° for FOR and AOR, but glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is unstable at such temperatures so the G A P O R assay is carried out at 70o.7 Activities are expressed in units (U), where 1 U is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of 1/zmol of substrate (2 /xmol of BV) per minute under standard assay conditions.

Protein concentrations are estimated routinely by the Bradford method. ~4 U n d e r these standard assay conditions the specific activity determined for all three enzymes is dependent on the amount of protein added to the assay, with higher specific activities obtained with higher protein concentrations over a range of approximately fourfold. Therefore, to enable comparisons to be made for the same enzyme with different substrates or between the three enzymes, similar enzyme concentrations should be used. Recommended concentrations for all three enzymes are 35-50 /zg/ml of the assay mixture.

Purification of AOR, FOR, a n d GAPOR from S a m e B a t c h of Pyrococcus f u r i o s u s Cells The oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is specific for G A P O R and the oxidation of crotonaldehyde is specific for A O R as neither reaction is catalyzed by the other two tungstoenzymes. However, formaldehyde oxidation, the assay for FOR, is catalyzed by A O R , so the activity measured in cell-free extracts is the sum of the activity of both enzymes. F O R can be distinguished from A O R by using crotonaldehyde as substrate, but the two enzymes can be separated from each other, and from G A P O R , by subjecting the cell-free extract to anion-exchange chromatography. The three enzymes are then purified separately, as described in the flow chart shown in Fig. 1. Pyrococcus furiosus (DSM 3638) is obtained from the Deutsche Saturnlung yon Mikroorganismen, Germany. It is routinely grown at 90 ° in a 600liter fermentor with maltose as the carbon source as described previously.I,~5 The three tungstoenzymes are purified routinely from 500 g (wet weight) of ceils at 23 ° under strict anaerobic conditions. The procedures to prepare the cell-free extract and to carry out the first chromatography step are described elsewhere in this volume. 15 In brief, cells are thawed in (1 g per 3 ml) 50 m M Tris-HC1, p H 8.0, containing 2 m M sodium dithionite, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5/zg/ml DNase I. After incubation at 37 ° for 1 hr and centrifugation at 30,000g for 1 hr, the cell-free extract is loaded onto a column (10 x 20 cm) of D E A E - S e p h a r o s e FF (Pharmacia Biotech. Piscataway, N J) equilibrated with 50 m M Tris-HC1 containing 2 mM sodium dithionite and 2 m M DTT. The extract is diluted threefold with the buffer as it is loaded. The bound proteins are eluted with a linear gradient (15 liters) from 0 to 0.5 M NaC1 in the equilibration buffer and 125-ml 14M. M. Bradford, Anal. Biochem, 72. 248 (1975). ~5M. F. J. M.

gradient (1.5 liters) from 0 to 0.2 M potassium phosphate in buffer A is applied at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Fractions containing A O R activity elute out when 3 mM potassium phosphate is applied. The purity of the A O R samples is judged by S D S - P A G E using 10% (w/v) acrylamide. The pure protein gives rise to a single band near 65 kDa. Fractions judged homogeneous are combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 20 mg/ml using a PM30 membrane (Amicon, Bedford, MA) and stored as pellets in liquid N2. This procedure yields 120 mg of A O R with a specific activity of - 8 0 units/mg. This is a 30% yield, based on the activity in the cell-free extract.

Formaldehyde Ferredoxin Oxidoreductase
Fractions from an initial D E A E Fast Flow column that have FOR activity (but not A O R activity) are combined and loaded directly onto a column (5 x 25 cm) of hydroxyapatite (American International Chemicals), which has been equilibrated previously with buffer A. After washing the column with at least 5 column volumes of buffer A, the adsorbed proteins are eluted with a gradient (4.0 liters) from 0 to 0.2 M potassium phosphate in buffer A at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. F O R activity elutes as 0.05 to 0.14 M phosphate is applied and fractions of 100 ml are collected. Active fractions are combined and concentrated to 12 ml by ultrafiltration with a PM30 membrane. The concentrated sample is applied to a column (6 × 60 cm) of Superdex 200 (Pharmacia LKB) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.2 M KC1 at 2 ml/min. Fractions with F O R activity that are judged pure by S D S - P A G E are combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration to 20 mg/ml using a PM-30 membrane (Amicon, Bedford, MA), and stored as pellets in liquid N2. With SDS-PAGE, F O R migrates as a single band of 68 kDa. This procedure yields 50 mg of FOR with a specific activity of - 5 0 units/mg and a recovery of activity of 7% (excluding the formaldehyde oxidation activity in the cell-free extract due to AOR).

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Ferredoxin Oxidoreductase
GAPOR-containing fractions from a DEAE-Fast Flow column are loaded onto a column (5 x 25 cm) of hydroxyapatite (American International Chemicals) equilibrated previously with 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM DTT (buffer B) at 4 ml/min. Adsorbed proteins are eluted with a linear gradient (1.0 liter) from 0 to 0.4 M potassium phosphate in buffer B at the same flow rate and 100-ml fractions are collected. G A P O R activity begins to elute as 0.1 M phosphate is applied. Active fractions are pooled and concentrated to approximately 10 ml by ultrafiltration using an Amicon-type PM30 membrane. The concentrated sample is applied to a column (6 x 60 em) of Superdex 200 (Pharmacia LKB) equilibrated with

buffer B containing 0.2 M KCI at 0.3 ml/min. The GAPOR-containing fractions are diluted fivefold with buffer B and loaded onto a column (5 × 10 cm) of Blue Sepharose (Pharmacia LKB) equilibrated with buffer B. The column is washed with 1 column volume of buffer B and adsorbed proteins are eluted with a linear gradient (2.0 liters) from 0 to 0.6 M KCI in buffer A. GAPOR begins to elute as 0.3 M KCI is applied. Fractions containing GAPOR activity are pooled, diluted twofold with buffer B containing 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, and loaded onto a column (3.5 × 10 cm) of phenyl-Sepharose equilibrated with buffer B containing 1.0 M ammonium sulfate. A linear gradient (1.0 liter) from 0.5 to 0 M ammonium sulfate in buffer B is applied at 5 ml/min. GAPOR activity elutes as 350 mM ammonium sulfate is applied. The purity of GAPOR-containing fractions is assessed by SDS-PAGE [10% (w/v), acrylamide]. The pure enzyme gives rise to a single band near 60 kDa. Pure fractions are combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration. This procedure yields 35 mg of GAPOR with a specific activity of - 2 5 units/mg and a recovery of activity of 5% relative to the cell-free extract. Properties of AOR, FOR, and GAPOR All three tungsten-containing oxidoreductases are oxygen sensitive (see Table I) and must be purified under strictly anaerobic conditions. All buffers contain sodium dithionite to remove any trace oxygen contamination and dithiothreitol to protect exposed thiol groups. 2 However, GAPOR is inhibited by sodium dithionite and this reagent is not added to buffers once the enzyme is separated from AOR and FOR. The molecular properties of the three tungstoenzymes are listed in Table I. A O R is the best characterized example of the " A O R family" of tungstoenzymes. Its gene sequence has been determined 16 and crystallographic analysis has established that it is a homodimer. 12 The AOR gene encodes 605 amino acids, which corresponds to a protein of Mr 66,630. Crystallographic analyses show that each subunit contains a mononuclear W atom coordinated via pterin cofactors, together with a [4Fe-4S] cluster located 10 ~, away that is coordinated by four cysteine residues. 12 The pterin cofactor, shown in Fig. 2, consists of an organic tricyclic ring structure with dithiolene and phosphate side chains. The W atom is coordinated to two cofactors through their dithiolene sulfur atoms giving rise to a bispterin site. A Mg atom coordinates the phosphate moieties from the two pterins.

each subunit of FOR has one [4Fe-4S] cluster situated 10 A from a mononuclear W atom coordinated by dithiolene ligands to a bispterin cofactor. The FOR subunits are not bridged by Fe atoms and they lack the EXXH motifs that coordinate the monomeric Fe site in AOR. FOR has one Ca atom per subunit not present in AOR and this is situated near one of the pterin rings. It probably has a structural rather than a catalytic role, like the Fe site in A O R . 13 GAPOR is a monomeric enzyme by biochemical analyses but is the least characterized of the three tungstoenzymes. From its gene sequence, it consists of 653 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 73,942. 7'1° The pterinand cluster-binding motifs of AOR and FOR are conserved in GAPOR. Although a crystal structure for this enzyme is not available, metal analysis of the pure enzyme shows the presence of one W and approximately six Fe atoms by direct metal analyses. It also contains two Zn atoms per subunit, the function of which is not known. The aldehyde substrates oxidized by AOR and FOR are listed in Table II.

taldehyde being the best substrates. These correspond to the aldehyde derivatives of the amino acids alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, respectively. Based on these kinetic analyses, A O R is thought to play a key role in peptide fermentation and to oxidize the aldehydes that are generated by the decarboxylation of 2-keto acids derived from amino a c i d s . 4A7 A O R cannot couple aldehyde oxidation to the reduction of either NAD or NADP but shows a high affinity for P. furiosus ferredoxin, consistent with this redox protein being the physiological electron carrier. 4 Although formaldehyde is used routinely to assay F O R during purification, the high Km that this enzyme displays toward this compound (Table II) suggests that it is not its physiological substrate. 5 Similarly, FOR has very high apparent Km values for acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde (Table II) so they are unlikely to be of physiological significance. 6 The inability of F O R to oxidize longer/branched chain aldehydes indicates that the catalytic site of the enzyme is only accessible to short-chain aldehydes. This is supported by a lack of detectable activity seen with aromatic substrates such as benzaldehyde, salicaldehyde, and 2-furfuraldehyde. F O R does oxidize short-chain aromatic aldehydes such as phenylacetaldehyde, phenylpropionaldehyde, and indole-3-acetaldehyde, although the high Km values again suggest that such aromatic substrates are not physiologically relevant. C4-C6 aldehydes with associated acid or aldehyde groups serve as the most efficient substrates for FOR, as indicated by the low Km values (Table II). Thus, F O R rapidly oxidizes succinic semialdehyde (C4) and glutaric dialdehyde (C5), yet the similarly sized unsubstituted aldehydes are very poor substrates. 6 Various C4, C5, and C6 semialdehydes are involved in the metabolism of basic amino acids, Arg and Lys, and also of P r o . 8'9 It is therefore thought that F O R has a role in peptide metabolism, although this has yet to be proven. Like AOR, F O R cannot use either NAD or NADP as electron acceptors for aldehyde oxidation, but can use native P. furiosus ferredoxin for which it has a Km of 100/xM. 6 During the purification of F O R from P. furiosus (and also from T. litoralis), a significant loss of activity is observed, even when strictly anaerobic conditions are maintained. This loss can be reversed by treating the enzyme with sulfide under highly reducing conditions. 6 Incubation of FOR with excess sodium sulfide (20 mM) and sodium dithionite (20 mM) at room temperature (pH 8.0) results in a four- to fivefold increase in specific activity over a period of 5 hr (see Fig. 3). This sulfide-activation effect is not observed if either reagent is omitted. When the enzyme is activated

FIG. 3. Activation of P. furiosus FOR by sulfide. The enzyme (10 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was incubated at 23 ° with sodium sulfide (20 mM, []), sodium dithionite (20 mM, I ) , or both (@). At the indicated times, samples were removed and the residual activity was determined using formaldehyde as the substrate under standard assay conditions.

with sulfide for 5 hr, after which the excess sulfide is removed, the specific activity of the enzyme decreases by about 20%. Thereafter it stays the same under anaerobic conditions. The sulfide-activated form of the enzyme is more sensitive to oxygen than the as-purified form of the enzyme. The substrate specificity is virtually the same for the as-purified and sulfideactivated forms. G A P O R oxidizes its substrate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), with apparent Vmaxand Km values of 350 units/mg and 30/~M, respectively (at 70°). So far this is the only substrate known to be oxidized by this enzyme. It shows no activity with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, benzaldehyde, glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, or glyoxalate. Like A O R and FOR, G A P O R uses ferredoxin as its physiological electron carrier and does not use NAD or NADP as electron acceptors. 7 The product of GAP oxidation by the enzyme is thought to be 3-phosphoglycerate rather than 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. G A P O R is a glycolytic enzyme that functions in place of G A P D H and phosphoglycerate kinase. 7 This is substantiated by the fact that both these enzyme activities are very low in maltose-grown P. furiosus when assayed in the glycolytic direction. 7 In addition, the cellular activity of G A P O R has been shown to be about fivefold higher during growth on cellobiose as compared to pyruvate, and expression of the gene

encoding G A P O R is significantly induced after the addition of cellobiose to pyruvate-grown cultures of P. furiosus.l° Hence, three members of the " A O R family" of tungstoenzymes have been purified from P. furiosus and characterized. Analysis of the genome sequence of P. furiosus reveals two additional open reading frames that appear to encode the fourth and fifth members of this family. These genes are termed wor4 and wor5 and are predicted to encode 622 and 582 amino acids, which correspond to proteins of 69 and 65 kDa, respectively. The similarities (identities shown in parentheses) of the sequence of WOR4 to those of FOR, AOR, and G A P O R are 57% (36%), 58% (37%), and 49% (25%), respectively, and those of the WOR5 protein are 56% (33%), 58% (36%), and 49% (25%), respectively. Hence both WOR4 and WOR5 are related more closely to A O R and F O R than they are to GAPOR. The sequences of the two putative tungstoenzymes contain the conserved motifs that bind the bispterin cofactor and the [4Fe-4S] cluster in A O R and FOR (and presumably in GAPOR). Homologs of the three known and two putative tungstoenzymes in P. furiosus are present in the genomes of other hyperthermophilic archaea, including P. horikoshii, TM P. aerophilum, 1~ P. abyssi, 2° M. jannaschi, 21 and A. fulgidus. 22 Tungstoenzymes of the " A O R

Introduction In most aerobic organisms the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by a large NAD-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. However, the same reaction in anaerobic organisms is catalyzed by a reversible, ferredoxin-dependent, pyruvate oxidoreductase (POR). PORs have been purified from archaea, bacteria, and anaerobic eukaryotic protists. The majority of bacterial and eukaryotic PORs are homodimers with subunits of about 120 kDa, 1-4 although a POR composed of two subunits (86 and 42 kDa) that form heterotetramers (a2/32) has been purified from the extremely halophilic archaeon Halobacterium halobium: Most archaeal PORs, however, contain four subunits (a/37& 45, 32, 25, and 13 kDa) and are octamers (a2/3272~2) of approximately 240 kDa. These include PORs from the fermentative hyperthermophiles Pyrococcusfuriosus and Thermococcus litoralis, 6'7 from the sulfate-reducing hyperthermophile Archaeoglobus fulgidus,s and from a number of methanogic archaea,
