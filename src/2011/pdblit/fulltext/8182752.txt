This article details a method for the manufacture ot metallurical coke. ` hc 1 method comprises mixing coal feeds with 5-l 0 wt.?; coke powder. extruding the mixture, and then coking in a test oven using operaticrn parameter\ based on relations between coke bulk average length and OVI' inner wall\ ~ along its parallel direction, the pressure required during extrusion of coke cake and the optimized oven temperature during injecting coal feeds. Thi\ method increases coke yield and reduces fuel consumption.

K.. Facultas-Universitaetsverlag, Vienna, Austria. The degradation of brown coal by the fungus Phanerochuefe chrysosporium appears to involve, in addition to lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase, other undefined agents. If such agents exist, they are anticipated to contribute to the catabolism of lignin and other aromatic compounds and may have diverse applications in biotechnology.

In addition to having higher cetane numbers these autoxidized diesel fuels also contained hydroperoxides. It is proposed that hydroperoxides produced from diesel fuel autoxidation have an important role in increasing the cetane number.
