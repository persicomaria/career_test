Abstract
Self-compartmentalizing proteases orchestrate protein turnover through an original architecture characterized by a central catalytic chamber. Here we report the first structure of an archaeal member of a new self-compartmentalizing protease family forming a cubic-shaped octamer with D4 symmetry and referred to as CubicO. We solved the structure of the ° Pyrococcus abyssi Pab87 protein at 2.2 A resolution using the anomalous signal of the high-phasing-power lanthanide ° ° derivative Lu-HPDO3A. A 20 A wide channel runs through this supramolecular assembly of 0.4 MDa, giving access to a 60 A wide central chamber holding the eight active sites. Surprisingly, activity assays revealed that Pab87 degrades specifically Damino acid containing peptides, which have never been observed in archaea. Genomic context of the Pab87 gene showed that it is surrounded by genes involved in the amino acid/peptide transport or metabolism. We propose that CubicO proteases are involved in the processing of D-peptides from environmental origins.

Introduction
Intracellular protein breakdown is a universal process that implicates protein degradation carried out by high-molecular-weight self-compartmentalizing proteases [1,2]. They belong to different MEROPS families [3] but have converged towards the same barrelshaped architecture. Compartmentalization confines the peptidase activity to inner cavities only accessible to unfolded polypeptides. Initial proteolysis is fulfilled by energy-dependent proteasome in eukaryotes and archaea [4] or by the equivalent bacterial counterparts, HslVU [5], ClpAP [6], or Lon [7], which generate peptides of about 10 amino acids long. In addition to the energydependent proteasome systems, energy-independent protease complexes have been described to further process and degrade the peptides produced by proteasomes. Organisms diverged in terms of peptide hydrolysis processes and have their own specific pool of different energy-independent proteases that functionally complements the proteasome activity [8]. Structural studies of such complexes, that putatively take part in the degradation of small oligopeptides, reveal several types of organization. The 720 kDa Tricorn protease from Thermoplasma acidophilum contains six subunits associated into rings with D3 symmetry and possesses trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activities [9]. A larger assembly has been observed in vivo for Tricorn where 20 hexamers form a 14.6 MDa icosahedral capsid, whose physiological role is unknown [10]. The TET aminopeptidases are present in organisms where Tricorn is not found [11]. The crystal structures of archaeal Pyrococcus horikoshii PhTET1 and PhTET2 have revealed that these proteases adopt a

tetrahedral shape containing twelve subunits [12,13]. Like for Tricorn, TET can form a supramolecular assembly of 800 kDa composed of 24 subunits and referred to as octahedron, only observed in vivo yet [14]. TppII is the only energy-independent selfcompartmentalizing protease found exclusively in eukaryotes and consists of a particle of more than 1 MDa displaying both exo- and ° endo-proteolytic activities. TppII adopts a toroidal shape of 28 A ° large and 60 A long revealed by electron microscopy data [15] and is considered as the eukaryotic counterpart of Tricorn. Finally, the DppA D-aminopeptidase from Bacillus subtilis was the only example of D-stereospecific self-compartmentalizing protease described so far [16]. DppA is a homodecameric particule with D5 symmetry only found in bacteria and archaea. Here, we report the structure of a novel self-compartmentalizing protease, the Pab87 protein from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon Pyrococcus abyssi. Pab87 is a serine protease belonging to the MEROPS S12 family and displays sequence similarity with penicillin-recognizing proteins, termed PRP (Figure 1). This proteolytic complex of 0.4 MDa adopts a D4 barrel-shaped oligomeric architecture with a central channel and an internal cavity. Furthermore, protein Pab87 is, like DppA, Dstereospecific as shown by activity assays and is proposed to play a role in the processing of environmental D-amino acid containing peptides.

alous signal of a high-phasing-power lanthanide derivative, the LuHPDO3A complex (Table 1) [17]. Pab87 is the first characterized member of a new self-compartmentalizing protease family, referred to as CubicO proteases as they display a cubic-shaped octameric form (Figure 2). The molecular mass of the macromolecular assembly was confirmed using analytical ultracentrifugation (391610 kDa). The crystal structure of the P. abyssi CubicO protease (Pab87) reveals a 422 symmetry, where the eight monomers are arranged in a barrel-shaped architecture. In the protease complex, monomers associate through a non-crystallographic four-fold axis to form two stacked tetramers that are themselves related by a non-crystallographic two-fold axis perpendicular to the latter. The C-terminal domains interdigitate and form a central ring of one third of the total height of the octamer, playing a central role in this oligomerization (Figure 2B). Moreover, cryo-electron microscopy data show that Pab87 adopts the same octameric structure in solution (Figure 2D).

At 90uC, the kcat/Km is 3.92 M21 s21 and 0.06 M21 s21 for respectively the Dand L-Ala-p-nitroanilide. The kcat/Km values increase drastically after 70uC. The maximum of activity was obtained at 90uC, the

The CubicO protease family
CubicO protease sequences, found in six deep-sea archaea and one marine c-proteobacterium, are constituted by two sequence domains, an N-terminal serine protease domain and a C-terminal domain without any detectable sequence similarity (Figure 1). The protease domain displays sequence similarity to PRP, notably the conserved catalytic motifs -SXXK-, -YXN- and -HXG-, and belongs to S12 protease family. The CubicO sequences can be characterized by three additionnal specific motifs, -YAEAF/Land -FFYLN- located in the N-terminal domain, the latter extending the second PRP catalytic motif, and finally -ERYfound at the extreme C-terminus (Figure 1 and Figure S1). With regard to the known energy-independent proteases, all CubicO sequences co-exist with at least one TET sequence. In the P. abyssi genome, four TET paralogs have been found. While TET aminopeptidases are present in organisms where Tricorn is not found, Tricorn is generally absent within the organisms that possess CubicO proteases. Concerning the D-aminopeptidase DppA, four of these seven organisms possess a DppA sequence. These observations highlight an intricate and complex distribution of either L or D-stereospecific self-compartmentalizing proteases among living organisms [11].

Mass spectrometry analyzes clearly show that Pab87 is able to hydrolyse the C-terminal D-alanine of pentapeptidic precursors with or without the sugar moiety from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, at 37 and 90uC (Figure 3A).

A novel association of two structural domains
The 50.4 kDa monomer of Pab87 consists of two structural domains, an N-terminal PRP domain associated to a C-terminal lipocalin domain that plays a crucial role in the octamerization and in the active site compartmentalization (Figure 2A). The NMarch 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 | e4712

terminal domain structure follows the pattern of the known PRP structures, composed of two regions, one a/b and one all-helical region with six helices. The a/b region is discontinuous in sequence and consists of a main eight-stranded antiparallel b-sheet flanked by three helices. The C-terminal domain is connected to the N-terminal domain by a small helix, folded back onto the last helix of the N-terminal domain. The Pab87 C-terminal domain presents a typical lipocalin superfold [18] that consists of an ahelix and an eight-stranded antiparallel b-barrel (Figure 4). This N-terminal a-helix closes off the top of the barrel, in vicinity of the PRP domain. Like for all lipocalins, the interior of the barrel is coated with hydrophobic residues. The tunnel observed in the lipocalins is replaced by a small recess at the bottom of the calyx. As lipocalins were first discovered in eukaryotes, and more recently in bacteria [19], the Pab87 C-terminal domain provides the first example of an archaeal lipocalin.

Structure of the macromolecular assembly
° The 400 kDa octamer looks like a 100 A side cube with a central hole along the four-fold axis and small entrances distributed around the equatorial plane of the octamer. The octamer can be considered as four head-to-tail dimers organized around the four-fold axis, forming the edges of the cube (Figure 2). Each monomer interacts with four other subunits of the octamer but main interactions are observed within the head-to-tail dimers, where monomers interact primarily with each other by shape recognition through key-lock type interaction (Figure 5A, B). Intersubunit contacts are formed by electrostatic and hydrogenbonding interactions between the bottom of the lipocalin domain of the first monomer and the all-helical region of the PRP domain of the second monomer. Three bottom loops of the calyx embrace two helices of the N-terminal domain at the inside and outside face of the octamer. Interestingly, one of these helix-loop interactions

° axes into a 60 A wide central cavern formed by association of the eight C-terminal domains (Figure 6A). Each active site, facing the central cavern, lies between three domains, the PRP and the lipocalin domains of one monomer, and the second lipocalin domain of a head-to-tail dimer (Figure 6C). The inside volume of ° the cavity is about 80,000 A3, large enough to accomodate small unfolded peptides (Figure 6), and reminds those of other selfcompartmentalizing proteases known to bury their active sites in an inner cavity. In the P. abyssi CubicO protease, the proteolytic chamber is separated from the access channels by two crown° shaped surfaces at about 10 A of each side of the equatorial plane. These crowns are formed by two loops of opposite monomers joining at the same height (Figure 6A). The shape and size of the cavity are conserved in all CubicO proteases as shown by the structure modelling of the six other members of the family (Figure S2). Variability mainly concerns the access to the active site through the large and flexible loops forming the inside crowns appearing to function as substrate sieves (Figure 7).

Conclusion
The presence of such proteases with D-stereospecificity in archaea raises the question of their physiological function as these organisms generally lack D-amino acid containing peptides. All organisms that possess CubicO proteases are found near deep-sea hydrothermal vents. In these biotopes, archaea and bacteria live in intimate and complex symbiosis [20]. Growing bacteria continuously release muropeptide fragments of their cell wall into the extracellular milieu that could serve as nutrients for other organisms living in the same habitat. As it has been shown for Pyrococcus species, heterotrophic organisms are able to utilize amino acids as sole carbon and nitrogen sources [21]. Analyses of the genomic context of the Pab87 gene revealed that it is surrounded by genes involved in the amino acid/peptide transport or metabolism, e.g. a PLP-dependent aminotransferase (PAB0086), a D-aminoacylase (PAB0090) and the dipeptide ABC transporter (PAB0091-95). Taken all together, we propose that CubicO proteases play a central role in proteolysis of these bacterial cell debris that contains D-amino acids.

Pab87 CubicO homologs were detected using iterative searches of the non-redundant database of protein sequences at the NCBI with the PSI-BLAST program and the C-terminal domain of Pab87 as the query. The initial multiple alignment of complete sequences was performed using PipeAlign [22] and manually adjusted to maximize the sequence conservation.

links spatially the first and the third CubicO conserved motifs through hydrogen bonding (Figure 5C, D). Whereas the twelve subunits of the archaeal TET aminopeptidases are organized as a tetrahedron [12,13], the drosophila TppII protease adopts a toroidal shape [15], the six subunits of the Tricorn protease from T. acidophilum associate into rings with D3 symmetry [9], and the ten monomers of DppA D-aminopeptidase from B. subtilis oligomerize in a D5 symmetry [16], the structure of the P. abyssi CubicO protease reveals a novel giant protease architecture, a D4 barrel-shaped oligomer with a central channel and an internal cavity.

Protein production and purification
Production and purification of Pab87 were carried out as previously described [23]. Briefly, Pab87 was purified by heating at 90uC, and using anion exhange and size exclusion chromatographies. The protein was concentrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5, 350 mM NaCl.

Analytical ultracentrifugation
Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using a double sector charcoal-Epon cell at 20uC and 40,000 rpm. Absorbance scans were taken at 280 nm every 1 min. The protein concentration was 10 mM in 150 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 350 mM NaCl.

The sedimentation data were analyzed with the program Sedfit [25] using the continuous c(s) and c(M) distributions, and showed that 94% of the protein sedimented with a corrected sedimentation coefficient s20uC,w = 14.7160.22 S. The estimated frictional ratio (f/f0 = 1.25) is consistent with a globular shape of the particle. The molecular mass of the particle (391,420610,670 Da) is in very good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of the octamer (403,542 Da).

Cryo-electron microscopy
Pab87 was diluted to 0.5 mg mL21 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5, 350 mM NaCl. 5 mL of this solution was applied onto an electron microscopy grid covered with a holey carbon film. The grid was plunged into an ethane slush cooled with liquid nitrogen. The frozen hydrated specimen were observed at low temperature

on a cryo electron microscope (Tecnai F20, FEG cathode operated at 200 kV) and images were recorded under low-dose condition (less than 2,000 electrons/nm2) on Kodak SO163 photographic plates. Areas covered with individual molecules were recorded at a 50,000 times magnification. The micrographs were digitized with a 5 mm raster size using a drum scanner (Primescan D7100, Heidelberg). The data was coarsened twice resulting in a final pixel spacing of 0.254 nm. Boxing and CTF phase correction of the 6,480 molecular images were performed in the EMAN software package. Image analysis was performed using the IMAGIC software package [26] (Image Science Software, Berlin, Germany) as described earlier [27]. The resolution of the final ° reconstructions was estimated to be around 14 A from the Fourier shell correlation function obtained by comparing two reconstructions, generated by splitting randomly the data set in half and according to the 0.5 cut-off in the Fourier shell correlation curve

Crystallization and diffraction data collection
Pab87 (7 mg mL21) was mixed with lanthanide complex solution at required concentration to obtain Lu-HPDO3A final concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 mM. Pab87/Lu-HPDO3A complex was co-crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion method with 20 mM CaCl2, 30% MPD and 100 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.6 at 18uC. Diffraction data from a crystal obtained with Lu-HPDO3A concentration of 200 mM was used ° for SAD data collection at 2.2 A resolution on ID29 beamline ° (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The wavelength was set to 1.3403 A corresponding to the lutetium LIII absorption edge (f0,28 e2). Data were processed with XDS [30] and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 suite [31]. The crystal has the symmetry of the space group P1 with eight molecules per asymmetric unit (see Table 1 for crystallographic parameters).

Structure determination and refinement
AutoSHARP [32] was used to locate the lutetium sites based on the Lu-derivative anomalous data and to generate initial SAD ° phases at 2.2 A resolution with a figure of merit of 0.35. Phases further improved by density modification, with a figure of merit of 0.88, yielded a clearly interpretable map that was submitted to automatic building using BUCCANEER [33]. The resulting built model corresponding to 89% of the structure was completed using COOT [34] and refined with CNS [35]. The R-factor of the final ° model is 0.196 (Rfree = 0.241), using all data from 30.0 to 2.2 A resolution (Table 1). The model contains amino acid residues 1­ 447 for chains A, B, F, G, H, 1­446 for chains C, D, E, 4 HPDO3A, 17 lutetium ions and 2,368 water molecules. The average root mean square deviation of the NCS-related subunits is ° 0.37 A for the 446 superimposed Ca atoms. Model quality and stereochemistry were checked using CNS and PROCHECK [36] (Table 1). Atomic coordinates and structure factors of protein Pab87 in complex with Lu-HPDO3A have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2QMI.

The assays were performed in a 10 mL mixture containing protein Pab87 (5 mg), Tris-HCl (20 mM, pH 8.0) and substrate (1 mM). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 90 min at 37 or 90uC, and desalted using a micro column (ZipTipC18; Millipore). The products of the reaction were analyzed by nanoelectrospray MS in the positive mode (Qstar Pulsar I; Applied Biosystems). The disaccharide-pentapeptide substituted by a D-aspartate residue (L-Lys3-D-Asp) was purified from the peptidoglycan of Enterococcus faecium M512 [43]. The disaccharide-pentapeptide substituted by an L-Ala-L-Ala side chain (L-Lys3-L-Ala-L-Ala) was purified from Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 [44] and the disaccharide-pentapeptide containing meso-diaminopimelic acid (mesoDAP3) was purified from E. coli strain ATCC 25113, a strain deleted for several DD-carboxypeptidases. The procedures used for peptidoglycan preparation, digestion with muramidases, and reduction of MurNAc to muramitol with sodium borohydride have been previously described for enterococci [43] and E. coli [45]. The resulting muropeptides, disaccharide-tetrapeptides or tetrapeptide formed by the hydrolysis of the C-terminal D-Ala residue, were separated by RP-HPLC in acetonitrile gradients containing trifluoroacetic acid [43] and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). The concentration of the muropeptides was estimated by amino acid analysis after acidic hydrolysis with a Hitachi autoanalyzer [46]. Pentapeptide L-Ala-c-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala was purchased from Sigma.

The octamers were generated using the same D4 symmetry than the Pab87 octamer and optimized through rigid body minimization. Minimization process was pursued using simulated annealing and energy minimization with CNS [35]. The geometric quality of the models was assessed with Procheck [38].

Activity assays
The D- and L-aminopeptidase activities were detected by monitoring the formation of p-nitroaniline from D- or L-Ala-pnitroanilide at 405 nm in a 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) from 40 to 90uC by 10uC steps [42]. The D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase activity was assayed on GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-c-D-Glu-L-(N e -D-Asp)Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala,
