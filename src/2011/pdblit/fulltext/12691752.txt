The K state, an early intermediate of the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle, contains the excess free energy used for light-driven proton transport. The energy gain must reside in or near the photoisomerized retinal, but in what form has long been an open question. We produced the K intermediate in bacteriorhodopsin crystals in a photostationary state at 100 K, with 40% yield, and determined its X-ray diffraction structure to ° 1.43 A resolution. In independent refinements of data from four crystals, the changes are confined mainly to the photoisomerized retinal. The retinal is 13-cis,15-anti, as known from vibrational spectroscopy. The C13vC14 bond is rotated nearly fully to cis from the initial trans configuration, but the C14 ­C15 and C15vNZ bonds are partially counter-rotated. This strained geometry keeps the direction of the Schiff base N ­H bond vector roughly in the extracellular direction, but the angle of its hydrogen bond with water 402, that connects it to the anionic Asp85 and Asp212, is not optimal. Weakening of this hydrogen bond may account for many of the reported features of the infrared spectrum of K, and for its photoelectric signal, as well as the deprotonation of the Schiff base later in the cycle. Importantly, although 13-cis, the retinal does not assume the expected bent shape of this configuration. Comparison of the calculated energy of the increased angle of C12 ­C13vC14, that allows this distortion, with the earlier reported calorimetric measurement of the enthalpy gain of the K state indicates that a significant part of the excess energy is conserved in the bond strain at C13.

Introduction
Light causes the all-trans to 13-cis isomerization of the retinal of bacteriorhodopsin. During the "photocycle" that ensues, the 13-cis,15-anti isomer returns thermally to all-trans, and a series of structural changes in the protein result in the translocation of a proton from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular side of the membrane. The steps in this sequence consist, approximately, of a linear chain of the reactions of intermediates K, L, M, N and O. The changes in the retinal and the protein

during the photocycle, and why they cause proton (or perhaps hydroxyl ion) transfers, have been studied extensively by various kinds of spectroscopy, site-specific mutagenesis, and diffraction of 2D and 3D crystals. The results have given a fairly detailed, although still incomplete, description of the mechanism of this light-driven pump.1 ­ 7 A less well understood but interesting question is how energy is conserved in the K intermediate, i.e. after decay of the excited state of the retinal but before any proton transfers. From a calorimetric measurement at 77 K, the enthalpy gain in the K state was reported to be 67(^ 13) kJ/mol,8 a value revised later to 49(^ 14) kJ/mol.9 If the protein on the time-scale of the formation of the K state (picoseconds at ambient temperature,10,11 and very rapid even at cryogenic temperatures12), is regarded as a rigid, non-compliant matrix, the

entropic contribution to the excess free energy of K will be only from the retinal. Thus, the gain of free energy in K might be larger than 49 kJ/mol, but probably not by much. Once the photocycle is complete, about 20 kJ/mol of free energy will have been retained in the electrochemical proton gradient created across the membrane barrier, and the rest dissipated. Studies of the K state have focused on the immediate neighborhood of the Schiff base of the photoisomerized retinal. In non-illuminated bacteriorhodopsin (the BR state), the Schiff base N ­ H bond vector points in the extracellular direction.13,14 As shown in Figure 1, the positively charged retinylidene nitrogen atom donates a hydrogen bond to water 402, which is in turn the hydrogen bond donor to the anionic carboxylate groups of Asp85 and Asp212.15,16 The 3D hydrogen-bonded network contains also OD1 of Asp85, hydrogen-bonded to OG1 of Thr89, as well as OD1 of Asp212, hydrogen-bonded to the phenolic OH group of Tyr185. OD2 of Asp212 is, in turn, hydrogen-bonded to the phenolic OH group of Tyr57. The positive charge of Arg82 and the hydrogen bonds of water molecules 401 and 406 provide further stabilization to the negative charges near water 402. According to Raman and infrared spectra,17 ­ 20 the configuration of the retinal is changed from all-trans in BR to a twisted 13-cis, 15-anti in the K intermediate. As might be expected, the distortion of the polyene chain is between C13 and the Schiff base. The prominent bands between 811 and 985 cm21 in the Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of K originate from out-of-plane hydrogen vibrations, which increase in intensity upon displacement of the C14H, C15H and NZH hydrogen atoms out of the plane of the retinal. These distortions of the photoisomerized retinal must upset the hydrogenbonded network in Figure 1. Indeed, frequency shifts of O ­ H stretching bands assigned to bound

water,21,22 Thr89,23,24 and Tyr18525,26 indicated changes in the strengths of numerous hydrogen bonds. In what form, then, is energy conserved in the K intermediate? The first suggestion27,28 was that the K intermediate (as bathorhodopsin in the case of visual rhodopsin) is a high-energy state because the positively charged retinal Schiff base has moved away from its counter-ion, i.e. Asp85 (later considered to include Asp212). In a more recent version of this model,29 the N ­ H bond of the Schiff base changes its direction, perforce, upon rotation of the C13vC14 double bond in K. In this case, the electrostatic cost of moving the N ­ H bond from the highly polar extracellular region to the hydrophobic cytoplasmic region would correspond, partly or fully, to the gain of free energy in K. The second model assumed that, as in bathorhodopsin of visual rhodopsin, the gain of free energy in K resides in bond distortions in the retinal that arise from steric conflict with the binding site after photoisomerization.8,30,31 Relaxation of the strained retinal, as the binding-site geometry changes with time to accommodate it, would transfer free energy to the protein. In the third, the "electrostatic steering" model,32 the retinal is distorted also, but its distortion arises because electrostatic interaction with the counter-ion keeps the N ­ H bond in its original extracellular direction. This strained orientation would persist until the Schiff base is deprotonated later in the cycle. Deciding among these alternatives can be done only on the basis of a full description of the geometry of the retinal and its surroundings in K. Electron diffraction of a 2D bacteriorhodopsin ° crystal, at 3.5 A resolution and in projection, detected no changes in the K state,33 but there is a report on the structure of K from X-ray diffraction.34 At 30% occupancy of K (produced by ° illumination with green laser at 100 K) and 2.1 A resolution, the retinal chain appeared disordered and the Schiff base N ­ H bond was shown as reoriented to the cytoplasmic direction. Water 402 was not present (or disordered), and the peptide CvO of Lys216, to which the retinal is connected, had moved noticeably. Displacement of the carboxyl group of Asp85 was suggested to be related to a rise of its pKa, in preparation for protonation by the Schiff base later in the cycle. Displacements were described also at Asp212, Tyr57, and Met20. Here, we report on our attempts to refine a crystallographic model of K in the same way as in the earlier report,34 but from crystals that diffracted ° to 1.4 ­1.5 A. We find that the structural changes are restricted mainly to the retinal, which assumes a distorted 13-cis, 15-anti conformation consistent with the interpretation of vibrational spectra in many publications. As in the BR state, the Schiff base N ­H vector points approximately to the extracellular direction, but a decrease in the NZ ­H ­ O angle makes its hydrogen bond to water 402 weaker. The results suggest that K is a

high-energy state to a large extent because the angle of C12 ­C13vC14 is distorted, a consequence of the fact that the retinal retains its initial extended shape in its binding site, in spite of rotation of the C13vC14 double bond.

Results
Spectral changes in the visible and the infrared regions have indicated that the photostationary state produced by illuminating bacteriorhodopsin films with green light at 100 K contains only the BR and K states.35 This is the case also for bacteriorhodopsin crystals. Figure 2 shows (a) the absolute spectrum and (b) the difference spectrum, which identifies the photoconversion as the production of K from BR. As calculated on the basis of the reported authentic spectrum35 of K, with a 5 mW, 532 nm laser the amount of K accumulated was 40%. This is near the maximum expected35 from the separation of the absorption bands of the BR and K states, the quantum yields in their photointerconversion, and the wavelength of the light used. X-ray diffraction was measured for crystals of wild-type bacteriorhodopsin, in the dark and

during illumination with green light as in Figure ° 2. Data were collected and refined to 1.43­ 1.47 A resolution (Table 1). The 2Fobs 2 Fcalc electron density maps for the non-illuminated crystal were ° nearly identical with that reported earlier at 1.55 A resolution.15 The maps for the illuminated crystals (four independent measurements on separate crystals), refined as single models, showed distinct changes at the retinal but few consistent changes elsewhere (not shown, but discussed in more detail below). At the retinal, the maps indicated out-ofplane and in-plane displacements of atoms between C12 and C15. The observation of this lightinduced difference depended on the high diffraction quality of the crystals. When the data were ° truncated to 2 A resolution (which cut the number of unique reflections from 41,822 to 15,723), the retinal atoms in the models for illuminated and non-illuminated crystals overlapped nearly perfectly (not shown). Refinement was then continued with a model in which two alternate conformations were allowed for 16 side-chains near the retinal, the segment of helix G that comprises the p-bulge15 near Lys216, the seven water molecules in the extracellular region, and the retinal. The locations were selected on the basis of less than perfect fits of the model into the density features in some cases, and reported structural changes later in the photocycle34,36 ­ 40 in others. The rest of the protein was refined as a single conformation. In the first of the two alternate conformations, with 60% weight, the atoms were fixed as rigid groups with the geometry of the non-illuminated structure, and in the second, with 40% weight, they were allowed to change by the refinement. For the retinal chain (from C6 to C15 and for C19, C20), and the lysine chain (from CB to NZ), the restraints were loosened greatly or removed entirely from the bond angles, but not the bond lengths. The result of this refinement yielded a second conformation that we assigned, on the basis of the arguments given below, to the K state. The differences between the diffraction data of the illuminated and non-illuminated crystals were assessed without bias from the refinement, by comparing Fobs maps prepared without phase information from the retinal and the side-chain of Lys216. The calculated correlation coefficients at grid points near the atoms along the retinal and the connected Lys216 side-chain, from C10 to CB, are shown in Figure 3(b). The map densities show distinctly lower correlation between the illuminated and non-illuminated crystal at the C12 ­C14 segment than at other atoms. As controls, the results of the same calculation but for two other pairs of crystals, non-illuminated versus nonilluminated (open circles) and illuminated versus illuminated (filled circles), are included (Figure 3(a)). We conclude that illumination changed the diffraction from the retinal, uniquely near the C13vC14 double bond, consistent with all-trans to 13-cis,15-anti isomerization.

first, and the C13vC14 double bond is clearly 13-cis. Because the differences in the maps are small and the model for the K state is derived from the minority conformation, confidence in the structure requires multiple independent measurements. In

In (b) the distorted 13-cis,15-anti retinal is shown in various ways. In descending order, the models from four independent determinations (blue, green, yellow, and red) are shown overlapped, in two views at right-angles to one another, and the model from the highest-resolution data set (red, cf. Table 1) is shown from the same two directions. For the latter, the model for all-trans retinal (gray, from (a)) is underlaid to illustrate the changes.

the following, we compare the models from diffraction determined for four illuminated crystals. Figure 5(a) shows the refined models of the retinal and Lys216 in the non-illuminated crystal (BR state), with atom notations and numbering. Figure 5(b) shows overlapped models for K from four illuminated crystals (blue, green, yellow, and red), in two views, and the model from the highest-resolution data (red). In the latter, the retinal in BR is underlaid to illustrate the changes in the K state. The changes appear to be restricted mainly to the retinal atoms between C12 and C15. Much less displacement, if any, is detected elsewhere in the retinal, and in the lysine side-chain. The variability among the four K structures illustrates the magnitude of uncertainty concerning the geometry of the retinal in this state, with data of the quality currently available. Table 2 contains selected retinal bond angles for the BR and K state. A large increase in the bond angle at C13 is seen, from 1128 to 1138 in BR with all-trans retinal to 145(^ 12)8 in K. This angle in BR is near the value in retinal crystals. The increased angle in K is consistent with the overall distortion of the retinal, which keeps it linear as in all-trans in spite of rotation of the C13vC14 bond that would otherwise introduce a sharp bend at C13. The ideal values for the torsion angles of the C13vC14, C14 ­ C15, and C15vNZ bonds would be 1808, 1808, and 1808 in all-trans, and 08, 1808, and 1808 in 13-cis,15-anti. In the BR state, the torsion angles are well defined: at C13vC14 it is somewhat less, by about 258, than expected, and the others are near their ideal values. In K, the standard errors of these angles are much greater, but there is little doubt that the C13vC14 bond has rotated to near its ideal torsion angle for 13-cis, while C15vNZ, and probably C14 ­ C15, rotated also and deviate from the expected torsion angles of 1808. For one crystal, illumination was not throughout the diffraction measurement as before34 but for ten minutes before data collection only; the structural changes were the same as in the other three models for K. In view of the importance of water 402 and its proximity to the retinal Schiff base,14 ­ 16 and the earlier report that it was not observable in the K state,34 we paid special attention to its presence in K. Whether the occupancy of this water molecule is 100% or 60% was difficult to decide, as it could be judged only from the temperature factors of the atoms connected to water 402. For the nonilluminated crystal, the B-factor of water 402 ° refined to 23 A2. The B-factors of atoms in its immediate vicinity, NZ of Lys216, OD2 of Asp85, and OD2 of Asp212, were somewhat lower, at ° ° ° 20 A2, 18 A2, and 20 A2, respectively, forming a pattern. In the illuminated crystal, with a single conformation model and full occupancy of water 402, the water oxygen atom had a B-factor of ° 24 A2. This value forms the same pattern with the B-factors of NZ of Lys216, OD2 of Asp85, ° ° ° and OD2 of Asp212 (22 A2, 20 A2, and 19 A2,

Positive torsion angles refer to clockwise rotation from 08 when viewed from the b-ionone ring of the retinal, negative torsion angles refer to counter-clockwise rotation. Thus, 1808 and 21808 coincide. a ° ° The data for the second BR and crystal 3 are in Table 1. The crystallographic resolutions for crystals 1, 2, and 4 were 1.54 A, 1.50 A, ° and 1.48 A, respectively.

respectively). However, when the occupancy of water 402 in the illuminated crystal was set to ° 60%, its B-factor refined to 16 A2. This is much lower than what the pattern in the non-illuminated crystal would predict, and suggests that water 402 is not absent or disordered in the second conformation, i.e. in K. The FTIR difference spectra of the K intermediate, measured with polarization and in 2H2O to separate the O ­ 2H stretch bands from interfering spectral features,21,22 lead to the same conclusion. The O ­ 2H depletion bands observed at 2171 and 2292 cm21 very likely originate both from water 402, because they are the bands with greatest downshift relative to the O ­ 2H stretch of liquid 2H2O (near 2600 cm21), and therefore represent the water molecule(s) most strongly hydrogen-bonded in the protein. Water 402 is unique in BR, being hydrogen-bonded to two anionic carboxylate groups and polarized further by a third hydrogen-bond, to the Schiff base (Figure 1). In the K state, both O ­ 2H bands shift to higher frequency, but by only 70 ­90 cm21, i.e. their hydrogen bonds are weaker but not nearly as much as what might be expected for disordered water. Inspection of the 2Fobs 2 Fcalc maps, and Fobs 2 Fobs difference maps, revealed little that was significantly changed in K elsewhere in the protein. Comparison of the maps for non-illuminated and illuminated crystals, as in Figure 4, revealed no movement, within error, of the side-chains of Val49, Tyr57, Tyr83, Asp85, Trp86, Thr89, Leu93, Thr178, Trp182, the p-bulge of helix G,15 and water molecules 401 ­404, and 406. There was some apparent movement (in a few cases up to ° 1 A) of the side-chains of Arg82, Leu181, Glu194, Glu204, Asp212, and of water molecule 407, but the same kind of displacements were seen in the second conformations of both illuminated and non-illuminated data sets. These discrepancies must reflect, therefore, local disorder instead of changes in K. The only displacement of possible significance, observed in all three illuminated crystals, was for water 405 which moved by ° 0.7 ­1.2 A in the second conformation (i.e. in K),

° but only 0.3 A in the equivalent conformation of the non-illuminated crystal. This movement would break the hydrogen bond of water 405 to NE of Arg82, although not to OE1 of Glu194. In the final refinement, only the retinal with all of Lys216 including its peptide segment, the main chain of helix G with the p-bulge, the side-chains of Asp85 and Arg82, and the seven water molecules, 401­ 407, were modeled as two conformations. There may be structural changes in the protein additional to those in the retinal and at water 405, but their magnitudes are too small to be detected or assigned uniquely at the resolution of the present data.

Discussion
The torsion angle for C14 ­ C15, (dihedral angle for C13vC14 ­C15 ­NZ) of 177 ­ 1798 in non-illuminated bacteriorhodopsin (Table 2) appears to be in conflict with the 164(^ 6)8 obtained for the H ­ C14 ­ C15 ­ H dihedral angle from solid-state NMR.41 We found that removing all restraints regarding planarity from the input model between C13 and NZ resulted in a C14 ­ C15 torsion angle different from 1778 by only 18 (not shown). Thus, for non-illuminated bacteriorhodopsin, at the available resolution and 100% occupancy, the retinal geometry is very well defined. As pointed out,41 both angles may be right. In a quantum mechanical/molecular dynamics calculation the C13vC14 ­C15 ­NZ and H ­ C14 ­ C15 ­ H dihedral angles were predicted42 to be different: 1798 and 1658, respectively, which agree fully with the later experimental findings. The retinal geometry in the K state is less well defined (see Figure 5(b) and the statistics for four data sets in Table 2), as it is the result of dissecting the contribution of a minority conformation to the diffraction. However, the results do answer the main questions concerning K. From the changes of the C13vC14 torsion angle (Table 2) we conclude that the C13vC14 double bond is rotated in K fully, or nearly fully, from trans to cis. In a relaxed

13-cis,15-anti configuration, where the three torsion angles in Table 2 would assume values of 08, 1808, and 1808, respectively, this would reorient the Schiff base N ­ H bond from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic direction. However, the torsion angle of the C15vNZ double bond (and probably also the C14 ­ C15 single bond), deviates from 1808 in the counterclockwise direction. The partial reverse rotation(s) allow the N ­ H bond vector to remain roughly in the extracellular direction in spite of the rotation of the C13vC14 bond (Figure 6). The non-planar torsion angles about the C14 ­ C15 and C15vNZ bonds are consistent with the large amplitudes of the observed hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP) modes in the K state.17 ­ 20 The new retinal configuration in K should change the strengths of hydrogen bonds in the network around water 402. This is evident in FTIR spectra, which have provided a fairly detailed description of these changes for K produced at cryogenic temperatures. From shifts of two strongly hydrogen-bonded O ­ 2H stretch bands to higher frequencies it could be concluded21,22 that two hydrogen bonds become weaker. The O ­ 2H bands were assigned tentatively to water molecules 402, 401 or 406, but most likely they both belong to water 402, as discussed above. Another O ­ 2H stretch, a more weakly hydrogenbonded one, was shifted to lower frequency, leading to the suggestion that the hydrogen bond of a third water molecule becomes stronger.21 The shift of the O ­H and O ­ 2H stretch bands of Thr89 to lower frequency23,24 suggested that in K the hydrogen bond of OG1 of Thr89, with OD1 of Asp85, becomes stronger also. Further, it was argued25,26 from a negative band at 1277 cm21 in K, assigned to the phenolic C ­ O2 stretch of Tyr185, that in the hydrogen bond between the side-chains of Asp212 and Tyr185 the hydrogen atom shifts to

Tyr185. Because Tyr185 is the hydrogen bond donor, this would mean that the Tyr185 to Asp212 hydrogen bond becomes weaker. The structural model for K we report here explains many, although not all, of these findings. Figure 6 shows the region at the retinal Schiff base in the BR and K states. Movements of the Schiff base nitrogen atom NZ, water 402, and Asp85 and Asp212 in K are no greater than ° 0.1­ 0.2 A, i.e. within the estimated positional error in the map. However, if the Schiff base N ­ H bond remains coplanar with C15vNZ ­CE, as one must assume, the angle of the hydrogen bond NZ ­ H ­ O changes from a nearly perfect linear 170 ­1768 in BR to 113(^ 13)8 in K. Indeed, polarized FTIR measurements of K in 2H2O indicate that the direction of the NZ ­ 2H bond changes by about this extent.43 Deviations from the optimal angle will make the hydrogen bond between the Schiff base and water 402 weaker, and increase the partial negative charge of the oxygen atom. By inference, water 402 will become a poorer hydrogen donor, and therefore its hydrogen bonds with the two aspartate carboxyl groups will become weaker. This would be consistent with the observed upshift of the two lowest-frequency O ­ 2H stretch bands. Further, being the acceptor of a weaker hydrogen bond, the carboxyl group of Asp85 will become more negative and a better hydrogen bond acceptor to Thr89, as indeed suggested from FTIR.24 For the same reason, its hydrogen-bond with water 401 should become stronger, consistent with the downshift of an O ­ 2H stretch band frequency.21 Alternatively, this band might originate from water 405. By the same argument, however, the hydrogen bond between Asp212 and Tyr185 should become stronger, and that is contrary to the conclusion made from FTIR.25,26 The reason for the disagreement is not clear. As for the Schiff base CvN stretch, its frequency is well defined in the Raman spectra of both BR (1640 cm21) and the L state (1644 cm21). Coupling of the CvN stretching internal coordinate to the N ­H rock results in shifts of 2 20 cm21 (BR) and 2 24 cm21 (L) in 2H2O.44 These frequencies and frequency shifts have been interpreted45,46 in terms of a relatively weak hydrogen-bonding of NZ ­ H. The CvN stretch in the K state is at an anomalously low frequency (1609 cm21), and appears to shift only 4 cm21 upon N-deuteration, suggesting further weakened hydrogen-bonding and thus lesser coupling with C15vNZ stretch. This is consistent with the structural change at water 402 (Figure 5). The distorted C14 ­ C15vNZ ­ CE geometry and the associated weakened hydrogen bond of the Schiff base with water 402 in K (Figure 5) is an unstable arrangement, not encountered in model compounds. We note that removing this hydrogen-bond may be sufficient, by itself, to destabilize the four buried charges around water 402 (Figure 1), and result in protonation of Asp85 by the Schiff base later in the cycle.

K Intermediate of Bacteriorhodopsin

Figure 7. Energy gain due to a change in the C13 bond angle in a 13-cis,15-anti retinal protonated Schiff base. The calculation, as described in Materials and Methods, was at various fixed C12 ­ C13vC14 angles, but with the rest of the bonds allowed to assume their lowest-energy positions. The latter produced very little change in the geometry. The results for both all-trans (open circles) and 13-cis,15-anti (filled circles) configurations are shown. Increasing conflict between C15H and C20H as the C13 bond angle is distorted raises the energies of the all-trans configurations relative to 13-cis. An energy difference of 49 kJ/mol, equivalent to the enthalpy difference measured for the K state,9 would correspond to a bond angle of 1428.

The red-shifted maximum of K in the visible region is explained, at least partly, by the weaker Schiff base N ­ H hydrogen-bond (Figure 6) and the unusual C15vNZ torsion (Table 2). There is a large electrical signal from the K state in oriented bacteriorhodopsin, with a sign opposite to the direction of proton transport.47 Its origin was suggested to be either the displacement of the positively charged Schiff base in the cytoplasmic direction or the redistribution of electrons, upon the isomerization of the retinal. In the crystallographic structure of K we find very little change in the position of NZ of Lys216 and the surrounding atoms (Figure 6). However, the redistribution of electrons between NZ and water 402, and in the connected hydrogen-bonded network, is a good candidate for the observed electric signal, as it would increase the magnitude of the Schiff base-counterion dipole. Table 2 compares the angle of C12 ­ C13vC14 in BR and K. The increase of this bond angle from the near-canonic value of 1128 in BR (all-trans retinal) to 145(^ 12)8 in K is related to the fact that the end-to-end length of the retinal is virtually unchanged in spite of the rotation of the C13vC14 double bond. We assume the reason is stiffness of

the retinal-binding site. Because in K the polyene chain cannot, as yet, assume the bent shape of the relaxed 13-cis,15-anti retinal, at least one bond angle is forced to increase. The angle that increases is the one at C13. We had described a somewhat increased angle at C13 (1258) in one of the M states that arises later in the photocycle,37 but this distortion is exaggerated in K. Is the excess energy of K consistent with the energetics of this bond distortion? The energy difference from changing the C13 bond angle in retinal was calculated with an ab initio quantum mechanical method (see Materials and Methods). The results for both all-trans and 13-cis,15-anti configurations are shown in Figure 7. Taking the calculated 3 kJ/mol difference between the minima for all-trans and 13-cis into account, and with the assumption that all bonds other than C12 ­C13vC14 may be allowed to relax to their minimal energy configurations, a rough estimation can be made for the energy gain from the C13 bond angle distortion in K. From the calculated curves in Figure 7, an energy increase of 49 kJ/mol would predict a bond angle increase from 1128 in all-trans BR to 1428 in 13-cis K. The observed value of 145(^ 12)8 (Table 2) agrees remarkably well with what would be expected if the energy gain in the K state were conserved solely in the distorted bond angle. This would be a novel result, as in-plane bends are rarely considered as a means for energy storage. On the other hand, the in vacuo calculated energies of the C13 bond angle in Figure 7 are probably overestimated because stabilization by van der Waals interactions with protein atoms was not taken into account. Additional excess energy of K is likely to be in the torsional distortions between C14 and NZ. This contribution is more difficult to quantify because of larger standard errors in the torsion angles (Table 2), and uncertainties in electron delocalization from the influence of the counterion and the water dipoles nearby. Calculating the difference between a relaxed 13-cis, 15-anti retinal with protonated Schiff base and the average retinal structure proposed for K indicates, however, that the enthalpic increase from torsional distortions between C14 and NZ should be significant and may be of the same order of magnitude as that from the unusual C12 ­ C13vC14 angle. The calculations showed that the majority of this additional energy would reside in the strained C15vNZ angle (Table 2). Together, these results indicate that a significant component of the energy gain in K is in the increased bond angle at C13. We have reported elsewhere36,37 that this angle is 1258 and 1148 in two sequential M intermediates of the photocycle. Thus, the retinal appears to relax in its binding site, and that should cause increasing changes in the protein related to transport. There is, in fact, indirect evidence for transfer of energy from the retinal to the protein. In an N intermediate-like but stable state of a BR mutant, where Asp85 was

K Intermediate of Bacteriorhodopsin

replaced with Asn and Asp96 had a lowered pKa and was unprotonated, FT-Raman spectra showed that the retinal spontaneously (in the dark) isomerized to 13-cis,15-anti.31 This suggested that once the proton acceptor and donor groups change their ionization states during the transport cycle, the retinal-binding site will favor the photoisomerized configuration. A similar conclusion was reached recently from interatomic distances determined with solid-state NMR in the D85N mutant at alkaline pH.48 Thus, while the excess free energy of the unusually wide C13 bond angle disappears as the retinal gradually relaxes to an undistorted 13-cis configuration, in the process energy will be conserved in structural changes in the protein. These are the changes that result in protonation and deprotonation of strategically placed groups and/or water and the release of a proton to the extracellular side and its uptake from the cytoplasmic side, i.e. the transport. The excess energy initially contained in the retinal in the K state, is thereby dissipated through creation of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient for the transported proton, and recovery of the initial state of the protein. Finally, NMR studies on the primary photoproduct of the visual pigment rhodopsin49 arrived at a similar conclusion as above, namely that electrostatic interactions and out-of-plane distortions were not sufficient to explain the stored energy. As in bacteriorhodopsin, the retinal is packed tightly in the interior of this protein, and it was concluded that a significant component of the energy gained following retinal isomerization must reside in unusual in-plane bends of the polyene chain.

Refinement Refinement of the models with SHELX 9753 took merohedral twinning14 into account, and used as initial ° input the model from 1.55 A resolution X-ray diffraction (PDB entry code 1C3W; Luecke et al.15). For the nonilluminated crystal, the 2Fobs 2 Fcalc maps, and the coordinates of the refined model indicated no significant differences from the earlier structure. The refinement of the models for illuminated crystals allowed two alternate conformations, with weights of 60% and 40%, at various side-chains, part of the main chain, the retinal and some water molecules. Rfree was not affected significantly by changing the weights of the two conformations, and they were fixed on the basis of the composition of the photostationary state in the crystals as estimated from the spectral changes. The groups in the two conformations were selected initially on the basis of possible changes in the density maps or changes reported in photointermediates that follow K. The side-chains with two allowed conformations were Val49, Tyr57, Arg82, Tyr83, Asp85, Trp86, Leu93, Thr178, Leu181, Trp182, Tyr185, Glu94, Glu204, Asp212, and Lys216. The main chain so refined included the segment between the CA of Ala215 and the N of Val217. Two conformations were allowed also for all retinal atoms, and water molecules 401­ 407. The groups in the majority conformation were each fixed as rigid fragments with geometries as in the model of the non-illuminated crystal, and the groups in the minority conformation, in the putative structure of the K state, were refined together with the rest of the protein where the occupancies of atoms were set to 100%. As a control, and in addition to the single conformation refinement, the model for the non-illuminated crystal was refined with two conformations in the same way. Small displacements at the retinal, and larger displacements elsewhere in the protein in this data set placed limits on what would be considered meaningful differences between illuminated and non-illuminated data sets. With the possible exception of water 405, as discussed in Results, significant and consistent differences between the models for the illuminated and non-illuminated data sets were observed only at the retinal. Omit maps indicated that the input model had little influence on the electron densities at the retinal. The coordinate set reported in Table 1 for the illuminated crystal is for the final refined model, in which only the retinal with the connected Lys216 and the main-chain atoms that comprise the p-bulge of helix G, Asp85, Arg82, and water molecules 401­ 407 were set as two conformations. Correlation coefficients were calculated with programs in the CCP4 suite54 for Fobs maps, made from the structure factor files with phases from coordinate files from which the side-chain of Lys216 and the retinal were removed. A tagged atom map was made with coordinates from a chain of 11 retinal and Lys216 atoms with sfall, and the correlation coefficients between pairs of Fobs maps were calculated with overlapmap at the grid-points near the desired atoms. Energy calculations Ab initio energy calculations for different conformations of the retinal with protonated Schiff base were carried out in vacuo, using the Gaussian 98 program55 with the 6-31Gp basis set. The effects of the environment, including the protein, counter-ions, and water molecules, was not taken into account. The energy

Data collection As before,14,15,36,37 the crystals, grown in cubic lipid phase as earlier described,50,51 are thin hexagonal plates about 80 mm £ 80 mm £ 10 ­ 15 mm in size. Pieces of the cubic phase with encased crystals were soaked overnight in the mother liquor plus 0.1% (w/v) octylglucoside, and the crystals were extracted and mounted by mechanical manipulation with a nylon loop. Spectra before and after illumination with a green laser (532 nm, 5 mW) at 100 K were taken with a fiber-optic microspectrophotometer.37 The crystals were light-adapted with white light before freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K, either while continuously illuminating the crystals with green laser, as reported earlier,34 or after ten minutes illumination and in the dark, at beamlines 5.0.1 and 5.0.2 of ALS (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory), using a 2 £ 2 array CCD detector (ADSC, San Diego). Typically, 90 ­ 150 images with 1 ­ 0.68 oscillation angles were integrated and scaled with DENZO and  Scalepack,52 in the P63 space group, with a ¼ b ¼ 61:2 A;  c ¼ 111:1 A:

differences calculated result only from conformational distortions in the retinal itself. The side-chain of Lys216 was truncated after the CE carbon atom. Full optimization of all-trans retinal from BR resulted in a planar conjugated double-bond system with bond angles close to those observed in retinal model compounds. Full optimization starting from the average experimental K structure ended in 13-cis, 14-s-trans,15-anti-retinal with an overall energy only ,3 kJ/mol higher than the optimized retinal structure in BR. The optimized K structure was used to calculate how the energy changes as a function of the C12 ­ C13vC14 angle. The angle was fixed within the range of 112 ­ 1528 in 58 increments, and the rest of the retinal was allowed to relax to its lowestenergy state. Calculations to determine the contribution of torsion angle changes to the overall energy were carried out in a similar fashion. In this case, constrained optimization of the retinal was performed with one or more of the pertinent torsion angles fixed at the average values for K listed in Table 2, while the rest of the retinal was allowed to relax. Protein Data Bank accession codes The coordinates of the two structures in Table 1 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under entry codes 1M0L and 1M0K, for the non-illuminated and the illuminated crystals, respectively.
