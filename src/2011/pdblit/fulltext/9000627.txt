Abstract Mg2+ is essential for guanosine triphosphatase activity and plays key roles in guanine nucleotide binding and preserving the structural integrity of GTP-binding proteins. To understand the structural basis for Mg2+ function during the GDP/GTP exchange process, we ° determined the crystal structure of n9-Sar1-GDP at low Mg2+ concentration at 1.8 A. Two Sar1-GDP molecules in the crystal form a dimer with Mg2+ presenting only in molecule B but not in molecule A. The absence of Mg2+ induces significant conformational changes in the switch I region in molecule A that shows similarities with those of Ha-Ras bound to Sos. The current structure reveals an important regulatory role for Mg2+. We suggest that guanine nucleotide exchange factor may utilize this feature to generate an open conformation for GDP/GTP exchange. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for COPII assembly and disassembly in which dimerization of Sar1 plays an important role. Ó 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In eukaryotic cells, transport between the compartments of the secretory pathway is mediated by vesicles, budded from donor membranes and fused with acceptor membranes. Budding occurs by the action of cytoplasmic coat protein complexes (COPs) that polymerize on the membrane surface, capturing cargo and SNARE molecules in the process, and deforming the membrane to sculpt out vesicles [1]. One of these coats, COPII, is known to mediate export from the ER to either the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or the Golgi complex [2]. The coat has two main functions, the physical deformation of the endoplasmic reticulum

(ER) membrane into vesicles and the selection of cargo molecules [2,3]. The COPII consists of three cytosolic proteins: the small G protein Sar1 and two large complexes, Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 [4,5]. The assembly and disassembly of COPII coat components on the membrane are regulated by the small GTPase Sar1, which is active (support coat assembly) and membrane-associated in its GTP-bound state, and inactive and off-membrane in its GDP-bound state [6,7]. The GTP-bound form of Sar1 also interacts directly with Sec23/24 complex [6]. Sar1 is a member of Ras superfamily of small GTPases [7­10]. Extensive structural studies on small GTPases have shown that large conformational changes between the two states of GTPases occur in two regions, designated as switch I and switch II. The GTP/GDP cycle is regulated by accessory proteins such as GTPase-activating proteins

(GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) [11]. The active GTP bound form is hydrolyzed to the GDP-bound form by its intrinsic GTPase activity, which can often be accelerated by GAP. Similarly, the exchange of GTP for GDP can be accelerated by GEF. Crystallographic studies of GEF of small G protein complexes [12,13] have shown that GEFs induce the GDP/GTP exchange through transient disruption of the Mg2+ coordination in the nucleotide-binding pocket while stabilizing a nucleotide-free and cation-free conformation. Mg2+ is an essential cofactor for not only small GTPases but also other GTPases. The release of Mg2+ from guanine nucleotide-binding site caused 500- to 1000-fold reduction of affinity for Ras [14­16], and Ran [17,18] to bind GDP or GTP. In the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of the small GTPases, Mg2+ is coordinated in an octahedral arrangement with affinities ranging from moderate (micromolar range) to high (nanomolar range) [19,20]. Although the conformational changes of small GTPases between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms have been extensively studied, little is known about the structures of the Mg2+-free forms. One motivation for this work is to study Mg2+-free form of small G protein and elucidate the mechanism of GDP/GTP exchange and Mg2+ function. In this study, we report the three-dimensional structure of GDP bound Sar1 at low concentration of Mg ion. Two Sar1-GDP molecules form asymmetric dimer (Mol A and Mol B) in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. While Mol B has Mg ion present, Mol A does not, suggesting weaker binding of Mol A of Sar1-GDP to Mg ion. The structure Mol A of Sar1-GDP shows the displacement of Mg2+ induces large conformational changes in switch I, which is distinct from the structure of the GDP/Mg2+bound Sar1 [21]. This structure indicates that switch I folds into an open conformation in the absence of Mg2+. The structural changes have several similarities with those of Ha-Ras bound to its GEF, Sos which induces a large structural change of the entire switch I region in Ras in order to achieve the release of nucleotide [12]. This structure reveals an important regulatory role for Mg2+ and suggests that GEF might make use of this intrinsic ability of switch I to accelerate the rate of GDP/GTP exchange. Materials and methods
Preparation and crystallization. The cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant hamster Sar1, in complex with GDP and Mg2+, were carried out according to the methods described previously [22]. In brief, since the wild-type Sar1 is not amenable to crystallize [22], a truncated (residues 9­198 out of 198) Sar1 (abbreviated as Sar1) was cloned into the vector plasmid PET11d (from Novagen Inc. Madison, WI, USA), expressed as a His-tagged protein, and purified by column chromatography using Ni­NTA­agarose (NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid) chelating (Valencia, CA, USA) with the Ni2+ ion. For crystallization trials, Sar1 was freshly thawed from 193 K, dialyzed into buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), and 1 mM Mg2+, and concentrated to 15 mg/ml using Stirred Ultrafiltration Cells, Model-5124 (Millipore and Amicon Bioseparations). Crystals of n9-Sar1-GDP were obtained at 25 °C by sitting-drop vapor diffusion method from solutions containing 7.5 mg/ml n9-Sar1-

GDP, 12.5 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM Mg2+, 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 14% (w/v) Polyethylene Glycol-4000, 50 mM sodium acetate, and 0.1 M ammonium sulfate equilibrated against 28% (w/v) Polyethylene Glycol4000, 100 mM sodium acetate, and 0.2 M ammonium sulfate. The crystals appeared about 12 h. Interestingly, No n9-Sar1-GDP crystals can be obtained without the presence of Mg ions. Thus, to obtain Mg-free form of crystal structure, n9-Sar1-GDP crystals were picked out and soaked in Mg-free solution (28% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.1 M sodium acetate, and 0.2 M ammonium sulfate) for 3 weeks. The crystals were found to diffract up to ° ° ° 1.8 A resolution and belong to space group P21(a = 52.8 A, b = 62.0 A, ° c = 71.1 A, b = 107.6°). Like n9-Sar1-GDP, it has two Sar1-GDP molecules (A and B) which formed a dimer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, but in Mol A, the Mg2+ was unfound (labeled as low Mg ion Sar1GDP or Sar1M-GDP here). Structure determination. Diffraction data set for low Mg ion Sar1GDP was collected at APS beamline 22-ID, and data were processed with programs DENZO and SCALEPACK [23] (Table 1). The structure of Sar1M-GDP was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMORE [24] using former Sar1-GDP (PDB code 1F6B) as the model. Water molecules were incorporated using Fo­Fc map calculated from ° 39.07 to 1.8 A. For this Sar1M-GDP, further refinement with CNS [25] yielded a final R-factor of 22.4% (Rfree 25.3%) for data between 39.07 ° and 1.8 A resolution. The final structure has an average B value of ° ° 27.5 A2, and an estimated overall coordinate error of 0.24 A from Luzzatti plot [26]. Consistent with dynamic light scattering measurements in aqueous solution [22], two Sar1-GDP molecules (A and B) exist in the crystallographic asymmetric unit and formed a dimer. The model comprises 2778 protein atoms, two molecules of SO4 2À and GDP, one molecule of Mg2+, and 207 water molecules. Majority of residues (90.1%) are in most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot [27]. The crystal structure of Sar1M-GDP has deposited to PDB (code 2FMX). The analysis of Sar1M-GDP was done using software packages Pymol [28] and O [29].

Results and discussion Overall structure Sar1M-GDP structure consists of six b strands (b1­b6) and five a helices (a1­a5). Residues 10­12 and 78­83 of Mol A, and residues 10­12, 48­54 and 78­84 of Mol B, lacking electron density were omitted from final model of Sar1M-GDP (Fig. 1). Comparisons of the current Sar1M-GDP with GDP-bound and Mg2+-bound form of Sar1 (PDB code 1F6B) show a small root mean square ° (r.m.s.) difference of 1.26 A for the 346 equivalent Ca carbon atoms. In contrast to this small overall difference, the switch I region of current model in Mol A shows large movement (Fig. 2) compared with wild type Sar1-GDP. The switch I region (residues 48­59) has an average dis° placement of 8.8 A for Ca carbons (residues 49­54 were disordered in Sar1-GDP), with the largest displacement ° of 12.28 A being located at Thr56. In contrast, the switch II region does not have a large displacement between two molecules.

The influence of Mg2+ during the GDP/GTP exchange process Extensive structural studies of some small GTPase have provided a wealth of information on the octahedral coordination of a single Mg2+ ion in the guanine nucleotidebinding pocket in both the GDP/Mg2+-bound and GTP/ Mg2+-bound forms. No Mg2+ ion in Mol A of the current structure was observed. Fig. 3A shows a 2Fo­Fc omit electron density map at 1.2r level around the nucleotide-binding site in Mol A. The orange sphere in Fig. 3A represents the putative position where Mg2+ ion was observed in Sar1-GDP in the presence of Mg2+ ion. This Mg2+ ion in Sar1-GDP structure is coordinated by an oxygen atom of the b phosphate of GDP, and the hydroxyl oxygen of a conserved Thr residue (residue 39 in Sar1-GDP) of the phosphate-binding GxxxxGKT39 motif (P loop) that is essential for Sar1 function (corresponding to residues 10­17 of Ras where x is a variable residue) [30,31]. However, no density was identified in this position in the current Sar1M-GDP structure.

Residues are shown in stick representation, and colored green for carbon; red for oxygen; blue for nitrogen, and marine and gray for a and b phosphate, respectively. The red and blue spheres are water. The 2Fo­Fc electron density maps were contoured at 1.2r level around GDP in Mol A and Mol B of Sar1M-GDP. For clarity, portions of GDP have been removed from the foreground. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this paper.)

Compared with Sar1-GDP, the OH group in side chain of Thr39 (in Mol A) of Sar1M-GDP rotates 110.7° along carbon-carbon bond, and the side chain of Asp34 in Mol A of Sar1M-GDP rotates 114.9° along carbon­carbon bond. But they have the same orientation as the ones of Sar1-GppNHp. Three additional water molecules in this region were observed (Fig. 4). One (W163) is hydrogenbonded to the guanine, and the second one (W128) interacts with a phosphate. The third water (W205) molecule forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Thr39 and two salt bridges through hydrogen bond interaction with Glu62 and Thr73 located at the inter-switch region, respectively. The third water molecule may play a crucial role in

the GDP/GTP exchange process catalyzed by Sec12. For Sar1 GDP/GTP exchange, Sec12 was observed to insert one or more than one residue (presumably from the seven-bladed b-propeller type WD40 motif) as a ``finger'' to disrupt nucleotide-binding site. The position of W205 may be the very site to be replaced by this residue. The W129 (highlighted in blue in Figs. 3A and 4) may mimic the Mg2+ function to stabilize the guanine nucleotide through hydrogen bond interactions after the dissociation of Mg2+ from nucleotide-binding site and in the absence of GTP. It is coordinated by an oxygen atom of b phosphate of GDP, the hydroxyl oxygen of a conserved Thr39 of the phosphate-bind GxxxxGKT39 motif, two

water molecules (W205 and W194), and the side chain of Asp75 from the highly conserved DxxG motif in the switch II region. These findings suggest that GDP is loosely bound without Mg2+ in Mol A and the dissociation of Mg2+ from nucleotide-binding site is a crucial step during the GDP/ GTP exchange reaction. In contrast with in Mol A of Sar1M-GDP, the Mg ion was observed in Mol B of Sar1M-GDP and was involved in guanine nucleotide binding. However, it does not have the octahedral coordination geometry typical for small GTPases (Fig. 3B). It is coordinated by the oxygen atoms of the b phosphate of GDP, the hydroxyl oxygen of a conserved Thr residue (residue 39 in Sar1-GDP) at the phosphate-binding GxxxxGKT39 motif, and two water molecules (W2, W114) with Mg­O bond distances of 2.17 ° and 2.61 A, respectively. Similar to Sar1-GDP, two water molecules in the Mg coordination sphere (W2 and W56) are further hydrogen bonded to D75 that belongs to the highly conserved DxxG motif in the switch II region. Mg2+ has been established as an essential cofactor for GTP-binding protein functions. For many Ras superfamily small GTPases, Mg2+ has been shown to be necessary for both guanine nucleotide binding and GTP-hydrolysis. Sar1 can be activated by spontaneous nucleotide exchange and recruited to the membrane in condition of low Mg2+ [32]. We propose that this exchange reaction of Sar1 goes through an intermediate state (Sar1 GDP/GTP intermediate, SDI): ½Sar1-GDP
Low½Mg2þ 

tured. We suggest the crystal structure of Sar1M-GDP (without Mg2+ in Mol A) obtained in this study at low Mg concentration represents such intermediate state. The conformation of SDI should show something similar with GTP-bound state. Structural changes in the switch I region in Mol A The most notable feature of the current structure is the dramatic conformational changes in the switch I region of Mol A associated with displacement of Mg2+. The orientation of switch I conformation of the current structure is very different from either Sar1-GDP or Sar1-GppNHp structure (Fig. 5). In Sar1-GppNHp, residue Thr54 in the switch I region (equivalent to Thr35 in Ras) forms bonds to the c phosphate and Mg2+ [33]. In the Sar1M-GDP, switch I in Mol A is completely shifted away from the nucleotide-binding site to expose the nucleotide. This conformation shows several similarities with those of Ha-Ras bound to its GEF, where Sos induces a large structural change of the entire switch I region in Ras in order to achieve the release of nucleotide [12], and not to participate in GDP recognition (Fig. 5). There are no direct or watermediated interactions between switch I and the nucleotide in current structure. The general strategy of GEF for loading GTP consists in a two-sided attack to release positive charges, the Mg2+ and the invariant P loop lysine, from the interaction with phosphate of nucleotide. Since this conformational change is consistent with the absence of Mg2+, we suggest that the conformational change in the current structure may function to load GTP and GEF of Sar1, Sec12, might make use of this intrinsic ability of switch I to catalyze the GDP/GTP exchange. However, the switch I region in Mol B of Sar1M-GDP lacks the movement in comparison with Sar1-GDP struc-

ture. All the changes happen in Mol A, but not Mol B. It raises a question that ``whether the dimer observed on Sar1 crystal structure is biological relevant?'' Biological implication for COPII assembly A titration experiment showed that the COPII assembly consists of two molecules of Sar1, one Sec23/24 complex (GAP for Sar1) and one Sec13/31 complex [34,35]. Recent studies demonstrated that the nucleotide exchange activity of Sec12 is also actively involved in building the COPII coat [32] and promotes coat stability and vesicle bud formation on liposomes in reactions containing GTP [32,36,37]. This implies that Sec12 can directly interact with Sar1 during the COPII assembly. The presence of Sar1 together with Sec12 and Sec23/24 in COPII raises a question: how kinetically stable prebudding complexes are maintained in the presence of both GEF and GAP during COPII assembly and disassembly processes [32]? Our structure of Sar1M-GDP shows the existence of two molecules of Sar1 inside the crystal and there are ° strong interactions with a buried surface area of 661.3 A2

between two molecules of Sar1. Our structure also indicates that the two Sar1-GDP molecules are not equivalent in terms of their structures, leading to an asymmetric dimer of Sar1. This concept of asymmetric dimerization of Sar1 and sequential Mg loading may offer an explanation for the apparent dilemma of existence of both GEF and GAP in the prebudding complexes. We speculate that the two Sar1 molecules in the prebudding complex are sequentially activated by Sec12 (Fig. 6A). Following Sar1 activation in Mol A (step I), Sec12 is translocated to Mol B, and an `inner-shell' complex comprising heterodimeric Sec23/ 24 is recruited through the hydrolysis reaction of Mol A (Fig. 6A). The Sec23/24-Sar1 `pre-budding complex' binds to cargo proteins to enrich them at the budding site (step II) (Fig. 6B) [38,39], and the cargo selection retards the GDP/GTP exchange [32] in Mol B. The COPII coat is maintained on the membrane by the presence of the nucleotide exchange factor Sec12, which counteracts the GTPase-stimulating activity of the coat by continually recharging Sar1 with GTP [32]. Sec12 may also have steric hindrance to surpass the GAP activity Sec23/24 to stabilize coat and vesicle bud formation, and prevent the recruitment of Sec13/31 before the release of itself from Mol B

of Sar1. Once the Sec12 is released from Mol B, the prebudding complex recruits the Sec13/31 as outer shell to form a complete coat, which then polymerizes at the membrane surface and imparts curvature to deform the membrane into a bud (step III) (Fig. 6C). Finally, the hydrolysis of GTP causes Mol B of Sar1M-GDP to dissociate from the membrane, and then the subsequent destabilization of the coat (step IV) (Fig. 6D). This model explains how the intrinsic instability of the COPII coat is reconciled with the efficient budding of COPII vesicles from microsomes in the presence of GTP [40]. Other protein factors, possibly cargo molecules or v-SNAREs, may serve to regulate Sar1p GTPase or otherwise stabilize the COPII coat to promote the GTP-dependent budding of COPII vesicles from ER membranes. Previous works showed Sec16 is a candidate for such a regulatory role and has a GTP-dependent interaction with Sar1 [41]. This is just a speculative model based on results from previous and our studies. A more specific mechanistic understanding of whether Sar1 dimer is biologically relevant will require a biochemical analysis. Studying the interaction between Sar1 and Sec12 will clarify this issue and further reveal the roles of Mg ion and switch I region during COPII assembly. Acknowledgments We thank Dr. William B. Balch at the Scripps Research Institute for providing us cDNA clone of Sar1 for this study.
