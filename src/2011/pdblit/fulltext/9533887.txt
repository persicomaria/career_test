Departments of 1 Internal Medicine 2 Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics and 3Chemistry Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis MO 63110, USA The structure and dynamics of rat apo-cellular retinol binding protein II (apo-CRBP II) in solution has been determined by multidimensional NMR analysis of uniformly enriched recombinant rat 13C, 15N-apo-CRBP II and 15N-apo-CRBP II. The ®nal ensemble of 24 NMR structures has been calculated from 3274 conformational restraints or 24.4 restraints/ residue. The average root-mean-square deviation of the backbone atoms Ê for the ®nal 24 structures relative to their mean structure is 1.06 A. Although the average solution structure is very similar to the crystal structure, it differs at the putative entrance to the binding cavity, which is formed by the helix-turn-helix motif, the bC-bD turn and the bE-bF turn. The mean coordinates of the main-chain atoms of amino acid residues 28-38 are displaced in the solution structure relative to the crystal structure. The side-chain of F58, located on the bC-bD turn, is reoriented such that it interacts with L37 and no longer blocks entry into the ligandbinding pocket. Residues 28-35, which form the second helix of the helixturn-helix motif in the crystal structure, do not exhibit a helical conformation in the solution structure. The solution structure of apo-CRBP II exhibits discrete regions of backbone disorder which are most pronounced at residues 28-32, 37-38 and 73-76 in the bE-bF turn as evaluated by the consensus chemical shift index, the root-mean-square deviation, amide 1H exchange rates and 15N relaxation studies. These studies indicate that ¯uctuations in protein conformation occur on the ms to ms timescale in these regions of the protein. Some of these exchange processes can be directly observed in the three-dimensional 15N-resolved NOESY spectrum. These results suggest that in solution, apo-CRBP II undergoes conformational changes on the ms to ms time-scale which result in increased access to the binding cavity.

Rat cellular retinol-binding protein II (CRBP II) is a 134 amino acid residue (15.6 kDa) protein that binds all-trans retinol and all-trans retinal, but not all-trans retinoic acid. Although its exact biological function remains to be determined, the localization of CRBP II to the absorptive epithelial cells in the proximal small intestine, suggests that it plays a role in the intestinal absorption and metabolism of vitamin A (for reviews, see Li & Norris, 1996; Ong et al., 1994). Direct interactions between CRBP II and enzymes such as lecithin:retinol acyltransfer# 1999 Academic Press

1180 ase could be involved in retinoid metabolism, however such interactions have not been directly observed (Ong et al., 1994). CRBP II is a member of a family of intracellular lipid-binding proteins that bind fatty acids, retinoids and sterols (Banaszak et al., 1994; Li & Norris, 1996). The crystal structures of apo and holo-CRBP II (complexed with retinol) have been determined (Winter et al., 1993). Like other members of this family of intracellular lipid-binding proteins, the crystal structure of CRBP II consists of ten antiparallel b-strands (A to J) and two a-helices. The two a-helices cover the open end of the b-barrel and make the ligand-binding cavity within the barrel virtually solvent inaccessible. Since the crystal structure of apo-CRBP II is almost identical with that of the holo-CRBP II, the mechanism of ligand entry and exit is not obvious (Winter et al., 1993). Nor does the crystal structure explain differences observed in the solution properties of the apo-form and holo-form of CRBP II (Herr & Ong, 1992). Apo-CRBP II has a greater Stokes radius than holo-CRBP II, eluting earlier from size-exclusion columns (Ong et al., 1994). Moreover, it has been shown that the apo-form was more susceptible to limited proteolysis than the holo-form (Jamison et al., 1994). These results suggest that in solution, apo-CRBP II may adopt conformations that were not observed in the crystalline form. We have previously employed 19F nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to examine the interactions of Escherichia coli CRBP II with retinoid ligands in solution (Li et al., 1989; Cheng et al., 1991; Rong et al., 1994). From these studies we have observed time-dependent ¯uctuations in the conformation of the bound ligand. In order to study the structure and dynamics of CRBP II, we have applied multidimensional NMR methods to study uniformly 13C, 15N-enriched E. coli-derived rat CRBP II. We report here that the solution structure of apo-CRBP II exhibits local backbone disorder which is most pronounced at residues 2832, 37-38 and 73-76, and an increased accessibility to the binding pocket than previously observed in the crystal structure.

Results and Discussion
Resonance assignments In order to study CRBP II under a condition that is as relevant to the physiological condition as possible, our experiments for the sequence-speci®c 1 H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments were initially conducted at 25  C and pH 7.4. Five spectra, including HNCO, HNCA, 15N-resolved total correlation spectroscopy-heteronuclear singlequantum correlation (TOCSY-HMQC), HCACO and HCA(CO)N, were used to establish the backbone connectivity throughout the entire polypep-

tide backbone. After the backbone resonances of a residue had been assigned, its side-chain 13C and 1 H chemical shifts could be assigned using the CC-TOCSY and HCCH-TOCSY spectra, respectively. Subsequently, the corresponding sequence could be deduced. A number of backbone amide protons were missing due to fast exchange with water, including those of residues 1-2, 16-17, 28, 30-31, 33-34, 36-39, 55, 57-61, 77, 91-92 and 101. Some of these were expected because they reside in the solventexposed regions in the crystal structure, such as the N-terminal region and the b-hairpin loop. However, it was unexpected that most backbone amide protons in the region of F28 to V35 were in fast exchange, because these residues formed the a-helix II in the crystal structure. The missing backbone amide proton resonances made it dif®cult to complete the sequence-speci®c backbone resonance assignment. A sensitivity-enhanced CBCA(CO)NNH spectrum (Muhandiram & Kay, 1994) with pulsed-®eld gradients to suppress solvent was recorded under the same conditions, but only a few of the labile backbone amide protons were observed. This result indicated that the intrinsic amide proton exchange rate occurred at a rapid rate under these conditions. To further lower the amide proton exchange È rate (Wuthrich, 1986) the 15N-resolved TOCSYHSQC and NOESY-HSQC spectra (Zhang et al., 1994) were recorded on a 15N-enriched sample at pH 6.5. The exchange rate was signi®cantly slower at pH 6.5 than 7.4, as evident from the increased sensitivities across the spectra. More importantly, all backbone amide proton resonances except for those of M1, T2 and Q39 were observable in both spectra. Most of the backbone amide 1H, 15N and 1Ha chemical shifts, as well as the side-chain 1H chemical shifts did not appear to be affected greatly. For example, the difference between the backbone amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts obtained at both pH values was less than 0.1 and 0.8 ppm, respectively. The chemical shifts that were most affected were the aliphatic side-chain protons of about 17 residues (ranging from À2.22 to 0.46 ppm). Most of the 17 residues have a polar side-chain and do not appear in speci®c regions of the protein sequence. Using the sequential NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) data available at both pH values, the sequencespeci®c backbone resonance assignments were completed (see Figure 1). In summary, the backbone and aliphatic sidechain 1H, 15N and 13C resonance assignments of apo-CRBP II at pH 7.4 have been virtually completed, except for the N terminus M1. In addition, all the aromatic 1H resonances and most of the side-chain amide 1H resonances have been assigned based on the intraresidue NOE connectivity at pH 7.4. The 1H, 15N and 13C chemical shift data obtained at both pH values is provided as Supplementary Material.

The cross-peak assignment is indicated with the one-letter code of the amino acid; sc, side-chain; &, indicates a crosspeak outside the 1H display limit (the actual chemical shift value is indicated). Note that some of the residues have more than one peak (see the text for details).

Secondary structure derived from the chemical shift and NOE The backbone resonances of a residue in an a-helix or b-strand structures exhibit distinct chemical shifts from those in a random coil structure. A chemical shift index method, developed by Wishart & Sykes (1994) was applied to calculate the chemical shift indices for the 1Ha, 13Ca, 13 CO and 13Cb chemical shifts, as well as the consensus chemical shift of apo-CRBP II measured at 25  C and pH 7.4 (see Figure 2). The consensus chemical shift index indicates the same but slightly shorter b-strands and the ®rst a-helix of the helix-turn-helix motif of the crystal structure of apo-CRBP II. The consensus chemical shift indices assigned to F28-V35 do not suggest a

helical conformation in this segment. This is different from the crystal structure. Of note, the 1 a H chemical shifts are consistent with an a-helix, but the 13Ca and 13CO chemical shifts, which are also used to determine the consensus chemical shift indices (CSI), are not. Analysis of NOE data (see Figure 3) was also used to determine the secondary structure. Using peak-to-peak alignment and the symmetry-check for the HNi-HNj and Ha-Ha cross-peaks, the i j interstrand NOE constraints could be identi®ed unambiguously. The result shows one a-helix and ten b-strands, consistent with the CSI data. However, the lengths of the b-strands are slightly longer than indicated by CSI. The b-strands A to D form one antiparallel b-sheet, and the b-strands E to J form another one. There are nine backbone-to-

Figure 2. The secondary structure derived from the chemical shift indexes of 1Ha, 13Ca, 13CO, 13Cb and their consensus. The rules proposed by Wishart & Sykes (1994) are summarized. (1) For each of the four nuclei, a chemical shift index of 1, À1 or 0 is assigned to all residues depending on whether their observed chemical shifts are greater or less than or within the range of the respective residue in a random coil. (2) A minimum of three consecutive `1's' for 1Ha or ` À1's' for 13Ca and 13CO is used to de®ne a b-strand. A minimum of four consecutive ` À1's' for 1Ha or `1's' for 13Ca and 13CO is used to de®ne a helix. The 13Cb chemical shift index is only used to identify a b-strand, which is de®ned by a minimum of four consecutive `1's'. (3) The consensus index is assigned to each residue based on a simple ``majority rules'' algorithm (i.e. two out of three for a helix and three out of four for a b-strand). The residues with a fast backbone-amide-proton exchange rate are indicated with asterisks beneath the sequence. A ribbon diagram of the predicted secondary structure is shown at the bottom. Notice that all the chemical shifts are available except those of the N terminus M1.

backbone NOE contacts between b-strands A and J, and only one between b-strands D and E. In contrast to the a-helix I region, there are very few respective intrahelical NOE contacts in the region of F28 to V35, corresponding to the a-helix II in the crystal structure, even at pH 6.5 (data not shown). In order to identify residues whose backbone amide protons are in slow exchange with 2H2O, a two-dimensional (2D) TOCSY experiment was carried out on a sample after four days of deuterium exchange. A total of 42 residues have been identi®ed, and they are indicated in Figure 3. As expected based on the secondary structure, all 42 residues occurred in the a-helix I and the ten b-strands, suggesting a strong and stable hydrogen-bonding network in these regions.

Tertiary structure calculations The structure was calculated initially from 1740 unique distance restraints, which were generated manually, as described in the Materials and Methods. A few rounds of calculations were carried out and violated distance restraints were removed. The ensemble of the initial structures exhibited a global fold similar to the crystal structure with relatively low precision. Subsequently, an iterative ®ltering procedure (Hodsdon et al., 1996) was employed to automatically identify additional distance restraints in order to improve the precision of the structures. In the late stage of the iterations, the small number of the remaining unassigned cross-peaks were manually interpreted based on the NMR working model to ensure that

the calculated structures would re¯ect the NOE data as completely as possible. The ®nal structures were calculated from 3262 unique distance restraints. A total of 24 of the 25 calculated structures were accepted, and their average penalty value was 0.14(Æ0.07). A stereodiagram of the superposition of the ®nal 24 structures on the crystal structure of apo-CRBP II is shown in Figure 4 and ribbon diagrams of the NMR and X-ray structures are shown in Figure 5. A summary of the restraint statistics and a histogram of the distance restraints are provided in Table 1 and Figure 6(a), respectively. An average of 24.5 distance restraints per residue has been obtained in the ®nal calculation, and only one upper bound and 35 lower bounds are violated in the 24 structures (Table 1), indicating good agreement between the NOE data and the calculated models. It is noteworthy that the method used here to establish the secondary structure and calculate the threedimensional (3D) structure is entirely based on the NMR data and not biased to the crystal structure. The structural and stereochemical statistics of the 24 structures has been summarized in Table 1. A total of 96.3 % of the non-glycine residues are in the allowed regions, which is a satisfactory value for the structures calculated using a uniform upper-bound limit and a simple penalty function.

The statistical values for other stereochemical parameters are also comparable within errors with those of the NMR structures of apo-iFABP (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997a). The average RMS deviation of the main-chain heavy atoms (N, Ca, C, Ê O) from the mean is 1.06(Æ0.12) A, and that of Ê the side-chain heavy atoms is 1.87(Æ0.13) A. The RMS deviation of the NMR structures from the mean, along the protein sequence is shown in Figure 6(b). Comparison of the NMR solution structure with the crystal structure of apo-CRBP II The NMR structure shown as a ribbon diagram in Figure 5, exhibits a ``b-barrel'' shape, which is a common feature of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family (Banaszak et al., 1994). As shown in Figures 4 and 6(c), the NMR and X-ray structures are very similar within the precision of the NMR structures, except at amino acid residues 28-35 and 36-38, which correspond to a-helix II and the linker connecting helix II with the bB strand in the crystal structure, respectively. In the solution structure, the segment 28-35 does not form a helical conformation (see Figure 5). This is evident from the phi/psi plot (data not shown), where only the phi and psi angles of residue 35 are within the helical region and the rest of the seven residues are either

partially or completely outside the helical region. The segment 36-38 shows large backbone heavy atom displacements from the crystal structure (see Figure 6(c)). When one compares the two molecules in an asymmetric unit of the crystal (see Figure 6(d)), termed apo-CRBP IIa and apo-CRBP IIb, the mainchain atoms of R36 and L37 diverge by more than Ê 3 A in the two molecules, suggesting that this region of the molecule is relatively ¯exible. The relative displacement of this stretch of amino acid residues were attributed to crystal packing interactions affecting the side-chain of R36 in the apoCRBP IIa molecule (Winter et al., 1993). The side-chain orientation for F58 is of particular interest, since it has been implicated in controling access to the binding cavity either by directly blocking the portal (Sacchettini et al., 1989; Banaszak et al., 1994) or by stabilizing ``capping interactions'' with helix II (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997a). As shown in Figure 7(a), the phenyl ring of F58 in the crystal structures of apo-CRBP IIa and apo-CRBPb is oriented such that it blocks the opening to the binding cavity. Interpretation of sidechain orientation is limited in the NMR structures,

since stereospeci®c assignments have not been incorporated and the upper bounds for a number of distance restraints involving prochiral side-chain atoms are quite large (Hodsdon et al., 1996). The RMSD of side-chain atoms in the NMR determined Ê solution structure is 1.87(Æ0.13) A. However, none of the F58 side-chain in the NMR ensemble sample the space in the vicinity of F58 in the crystal structure. In contrast, other amino acid residues framing the opening to the binding cavity, I26, T30, R59 and G77, in the NMR do sample the space occupied by the crystal structure or apoCRBP IIa and apo-CRBP IIb. NOE cross-peaks were detected between the d and e-protons of F58 and the g-proton of L37 (see Figure 7(b)). The distances between these protons Ê exceed the 5 A upper bound (with the averages Ê Ê around 14 A for apo-CRBP IIa and 7 A for apo-CRBP IIb) for detection of NOE cross-peaks in both molecules in the apo-CRBP II crystal. This provides strong evidence that despite the disorder in this region, the solution structure of apo-CRBP II differs from the crystal structure. The orientation of L37 in the solution structure is also quite different from that observed in the crystal structure

due to displacement of R36, L37 and Q39, as discussed above. We cannot, however, completely exclude the presence of minor NOE cross-peaks between protons on F58 and those on T30, due to peak overlap in this region of the spectra. A similar reorientation was observed in the comparable F57 residue of the homologous holo-form of adipocyte lipid binding protein, but not in the apo-form (Xu et al., 1993).

There are a relative lack of distance constraints at the bE-bF turn in the solution structure of apo-CRBP II. As a consequence, there is increased disorder in this region of the structure. The distance between the mean coordinates of Ca of R59 in the bC-bD loop and of Ca of G77 in the Ê bE-bF loop is 10.6 A (with distances ranging from Ê 9.2-12.1 A in the NMR ensemble). This distance is Ê $3 A greater than the distance between these two

atoms in the crystal structure of apo-CRBP II, and re¯ects the somewhat increased gap between the bD and bF strands. The electron density for G77 is poorly de®ned in the X-ray structure of apo and holo-CRBP II (Winter et al., 1993), suggesting that even in the crystalline form there is increased disorder. There are discrete regions of increased backbone disorder in the ensemble of 24 NMR structures as evidenced by the increased RMSD from the mean structure (see Figures 4 and 6(b)). These regions can be mapped to residues 1-5 (the N-terminal), 28-32, 36-39, 73-76 (the bE-bF turn), and to a somewhat lesser degree to 61-62 (the bC-bD) and 100101 (the bG-bH turn). The increased disorder correspond to residues that have few distance restraints, which may be due to either the position or the dynamic motion of these residues. Similar observations of localized disorder have been previously made with other members of the intracellular lipid È binding protein (Lassen et al., 1995; Lucke et al.,

1996; Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997a; Zhang et al., 1997). Amide hydrogen exchange measured by saturation transfer To determine whether disorder in the NMR structures was also due to molecular ¯exibility, the backbone mobility of apo-CRBP II was monitored by 1H exchange and amide 15N relaxation NMR measurements. Gradient enhanced 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra were accumulated for apo-CRBP II with and without solvent presaturation. The relative peak intensities with and without water saturation are plotted in Figure 8(a). A decrease in peak intensity due to saturation transfer was observed at residues N16, F28-A34 (helix II), T38 (beginning of b-strand B), T57-N60 (bC-bD turn), and E91-N93 (bG-bH turn).

increased ¯exibility in these regions on the ms to ms time-scale. Spectral density function analysis The 15N NMR relaxation parameters were analyzed using ®ve different representations of the spectral density function based on the Lipari and Szabo formalism as described (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997b). The globally optimized overall rotation time is 8.2 ns. Different parameters have been used to ®t the relaxation data. The three-parameter ®t, including the order parameter S2, the effective internal correlation time te and the exchange rate Rex, yielded the most satisfactory result of the dynamics implied in the relaxation data.

Within experimental error, no signi®cant elevation in T1 or depression in NOEs, which are indicative of internal motions on a subnanosecond time scale, was observed. However, the relatively large standard deviations associated with some of the values due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio, limit the interpretation of this experiment. Depression of the T2 values parallel with the regions observed for increased saturation transfer, further support

®tting procedures. The resulting S2 and the Rex values are shown in Figure 9(a) and (b), respectively. The majority of the residues are characterized by order parameters between 0.8 and 0.9. Slightly lower order parameters were observed in the bF-bG turn and the bG-bH turn. Surprisingly, the order parameters of residues 28-35, which do not form a helical conformation in the solution structure, remain relatively high. The most striking differences observed along the backbone are the variations in the Rex term. Non-zero Rex parameters are observed at residues 28-40 and those in the bC-bD turn, the bE-bF turn, and the bG-bH turn. The largest measurable Rex terms are in the segment 28-40 and the bC-bD turn. A likely interpretation is that exchange between the open portal conformation observed in solution and the closed portal conformation observed in the crystal structure occurs on the ms to ms time scale (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997b). Conformational exchange of backbone amide protons The pH was changed from pH 7.4 to 6.5 in order to assign the labile backbone amide protons. A total of 24 residues showed multiple backbone HN resonances in the 3D 15N-resolved TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC spectra recorded at pH 6.5. Some of these resonances could also be detected on reinspection of the HSQC spectrum recorded in pH 7.4. A summary of these multiple resonances is provided in Table 2. Most of the residues reside in the disorder regions of the solution structure, such as

the N-terminal segment, the segment 28-38, and the bC-bD, bF-bG and bH-bI turns. But a few reside in the apparently ordered regions, such as the a-helix I and the b-strand H, and the reason for these is not clear. The chemical shift difference is quite small for most of the backbone amide groups (see Table 2). The biggest difference occurs at A29, I33, R36 and L37. The intensity ratios range from 1.0 to 8.0. The multiple backbone HN resonances have also been observed in other members of the intracellular lipid-binding proteins (Lassen et al., 1995; Constantine et al., 1998). They also occurred in the ¯exible regions of the protein, such as the a-helix II and bC-bD turn. Wang et al. (1997) observed that the side-chain of Trp89 appears to adopt two conformations in the apo-form of cellular retinoic-binding protein II (CRABP II) since two sets of aromatic resonances have been identi®ed. The N-terminal methionine is retained in 80 % of our sample. For multiple resonances that have intensity ratios of 4:1, chemical heterogeneity in the sample may lead to the detection of multiple resonances. However, for multiple resonances that have intensity ratios other than 4:1, it is dif®cult to invoke chemical heterogeneity. The detection of two-site chemical exchange between resonances in the 3D 15N-resolved NOESY spectrum recorded at pH 6.5 (see Figure 10 and Table 2) suggests that the protein is undergoing conformational changes in solution. Four of the eight exchange sites are at residues D27, F28, I33 and R36. Other exchange sites include G19 at the beginning of the a-helix I, R59 at the bC-bD turn, G106 and V111 at b-strand

Structure and Dynamics of apo-CRBP II in Solution

1191 tion on the conformation of the segment 28-35 in the solution structure of apo-CRBP II. Regional backbone disorder in the portal region has been observed in other members of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family, including iFABP (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997b; Zhang et al., 1997), iLBP (Lassen et al., 1995), and CRABP II (Wang et al., 1998). However, while iFABP shows no major changes in protein conformation between the apo and holo-forms (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997b; Scapin et al., 1992), CRABP I and CRABP II exhibit changes in protein conformation with ligand binding. Comparison of the crystal structure of apo-CRABP I with the crystal structure of holoCRABP I shows that the bC-bD loop moves out to different extents due to the formation of the intermolecular b-sheet between the two bD strands (Thompson et al., 1995). The entrance to the binding pocket of R111 M CRABP II is enlarged due to partial unwinding of the N terminus of the second helix and outward movement of both the bC-bD and bE-bF loops (Chen et al., 1998). The solution structure of human apo-CRABP II shows a much more exposed binding pocket that is readily accessible to retinoic acid. This region appears to be disordered, since most residues in the region had weak or no observable peaks in all the 15Nedited spectra. The distance between the bE-bF Ê turn and the bD-bE turn is 8 A longer in the solution structure of the apo-protein than in the crystal structure of the holo-protein. The bC-bD Ê loop moves away from the main body $5 A in the solution structure. Molecular dynamic simulation of the highly homologous protein, holo and apoCRBP (Van Aalten et al., 1995) predicted a hinge bending motion involving the bC-bD and bE-bF loops and the second helix of the helix-turn-helix motif. Mutagenesis of G67, which serves as the ``hinge'' between the bC-bD and bE-bF turns, abolished binding of ligand (Van Aalten et al., 1997). The distance between the bC-bD turn and the bE-bF turn in the solution structure of apoÊ CRBP II, is also increased ($3 A) compared with crystal structures of both apo- and holo-CRBP II, but this increase is less dramatic than that observed for apo-CRABP II. A constant concern is whether these differences re¯ect under determination of distance restraints, since the detection of a small number of NOE cross-peaks had a signi®cant impact on the ®nal structure. We have shown that polar interactions between the retinol and the Gln107 in CRBP II are important for ligand binding speci®city (Cheng et al., 1991; Jakoby et al., 1993), but the structural basis for the binding af®nity is less well understood. Analyses of a helixless mutant of iFABP suggest that while the helix-loop-helix motif is not essential for ligand binding, loss of this portion of the protein markedly increases the dissociation constant (Cistola et al., 1996; Steele et al., 1998). It has been more dif®cult to predict the effects of altering individual amino acid residues on the binding af®nity (Ory et al., 1997). Kleinfeld and co-workers have

the solution structure (see Figure 6(b)). These data suggest that the conformational change in this region could be signi®cant. The difference in their cross-peak intensities further suggests that the two states could not be equally populated. A few HNi  2-HNi and HNi  3-Ha NOEs have been i identi®ed in the minor conformation, but not the major one at pH 6.5. Although not suf®cient, this result suggests that the less populated state may adopt a helical conformation. It is important to note that the structural calculations were based on generating a single structure, when the protein actually ¯uctuates between more than one conformation. New algorithms need to be developed to take the existence of multiple conformations into consideration. Implications for the mechanism of ligand entry There is no obvious portal into the ligand-binding site in the crystal structure of apo-CRBP II (Winter et al., 1993). However, a small aperture was observed in the solution structure of apoCRBP II that could potentially accommodate initial entry of the polar end of the retinol molecule. This is due largely to close interactions of F58 in the bC-bD turn with L37, which alters the orientation of F58 and displaces the main-chain atoms in the vicinity of residues 36-38. Associated with this displacement of residues 36-38, is the loss of the helical characteristics of the segment 28-35. This is similar to the partial unwinding of the second helix observed in the crystal structure of the R111 M CRABPII mutant protein (Chen et al., 1998) and the solution structure of apo-iFABP (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997a). We have found that in the solution structure of apo-CRBP II, the binding cavity is more accessible to ligand entry. Reorientation of the F58 side-chain is not suf®cient to accommodate the ring moiety of the retinol molecule. However, localized backbone disorder was observed in the regions bordering the portal, particularly in the segment 28-38 and the bE-bF turn, by multiple parameters. These include the consensus chemical shift index, backbone amide 1 H exchange, the root-mean-square deviation of backbone atoms in the ensemble relative to a mean structure, and 15N relaxation data. The disorder and increased mobility in the segment 28-38 and at the bE-bF turn may allow further opening of the portal to accommodate the b-ionone ring of the retinol molecule. Once the retinol molecule has entered the binding pocket, hydrophobic interactions between F58 and the bound retinol molecule may cause the side-chain of F58 to reorient such that the side-chain of F58 now blocks the portal. The NMR data from CRBP II complexed with all-trans retinol (data not shown) show that the segment 28-35 retains a helical conformation in solution. Therefore, the reorientation of F58 may also help to stabilize the helical conformation in the segment 28-35, as it would weaken the tethering of L37 to the bC-bD turn and release the distor-

1192 shown that mutagenesis of individual amino acids results in compensatory changes in the entropy and enthalpy of binding, that are often larger than the binding free energy (Richieri et al., 1998). Mutagenesis of F57 in ALBP results in decreased binding af®nity without affecting binding selectivity (Simpson & Bernlohr, 1998). This phenylalanine residue is a highly conserved residue among members of this family of intracellular lipid binding proteins. Hodsdon & Cistola (1997b) have proposed that the corresponding F55 of iFABP participates in long range capping interactions with the C terminus of the second helix, which are further stabilized by the bound fatty acid in the holo-protein. In this model F55 plays a central role in the order-disorder equilibrium by coupling fatty acid binding with helix stabilization. It may be that variation in the dynamics of the portal region may play an important role in determining ligand-binding af®nity. Comparisons of backbone picosecond to nanosecond time scale dynamic behaviors among fatty acid binding proteins progress from relatively rigid in human muscle fatty acid binding protein (Constantine et al., 1998), to ¯exible in human adipocyte lipidbinding protein (Constantine et al., 1998), to almost completely disordered in apo-iFABP (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997b). We have found that the backbone picosecond to nanosecond time scale behavior of CRBP II most closely resembles that of ALBP, and is relatively rigid. CRBP II shares 56 % amino acid identity with CRBP, but has a much lower binding af®nity for all-trans retinol than does CRBP (Li et al., 1991). Our studies suggest that non-conserved amino acid residues in the portal region of these two homologous proteins, particularly the amino acid residues that interact with F58 play a particularly important role in in¯uencing binding af®nity. Studies are underway to further probe the structural and dynamic basis for the differences in binding properties of CRBP and CRBP II.

Structure and Dynamics of apo-CRBP II in Solution MA) or 9:1 H2O/2H2O. The phosphate buffer contained 20 mM phosphate, 50 mM KCl, 0.05 % NaN3, and 2-5 mM 1-d2, 2-d2 b-mercaptoethanol (Isotech, MA), and its pH was adjusted to either 7.4 or 6.5. Samples of 13 C,15N-enriched apo-CRBP II in H2O and 2H2O were made at pH 7.4. A sample of 15N-enriched apo-CRBP II in H2O was made at pH 6.5. Finally, a 2H2O sample of non-labeled apo-CRBP II was also prepared at pH 7.4 for the aromatic 1H resonance assignment. The concentrations of all the NMR samples were 1.0-2.0 mM. NMR spectroscopy All NMR experiments were carried out at 25  C on either a Varian UNITY 600 MHz or 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with actively shielded Z-gradient probes and gradient ampli®er units. The triple-resonance 3D NMR spectra used to establish sequence-speci®c 1H, 13 C and 15N resonance assignments and determine the solution structure of apo CRBP II were acquired and processed in ways similar to those described (Hodsdon et al., 1995, 1996). The acquisition and processing parameters for these spectra are provided as Supplementary Material. The 2D gradient-enhanced HSQC experiments for the measurements of saturation transfer, the 15N longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (T1 and T2, respectively), and the steady-state {1H}15N NOE were acquired on the 15N-enriched protein sample and processed in ways similar to those described (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997b). The 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced externally to TSP, and the 15N chemical shift to 15N-NH4Cl (Wishart & Sykes, 1994). Restraint derivation and structure calculations All structure calculations were performed on either a Silicon Graphics INDY/R4400 workstation or a SUN ULTRASPARC10 workstation using DISTGEOM, a unique distance geometry/simulated annealing algorithm implemented in the TINKER protein modeling package described by Hodsdon et al. (1996). This distance geometry algorithm employs a pairwise Gaussian metrization. In the simulated annealing procedure following distance geometry, a simple penalty function containing terms only for the experimental NMR restraints and standard local covalent bond geometries was used. The initial NMR-based model was derived from the combined use of the 1H/13C consensus chemical shift and a subset of symmetry-checked unambigously assigned NOE cross-peaks, derived from the 3D 15N-resolved NOESY-HMQC and 13C-resolved NOESY-HSQC recorded at pH 7.4. The initial assignment of NOE cross-peaks was carried out in a systematic fashion. First, intraresidue and sequential NOE cross-peaks were identi®ed, which would then be used as internal references to reduce ambiguities in the subsequent NOE assignments. Secondly, NOE cross-peaks È de®ning the regular secondary structures (Wuthrich, 1986) were identi®ed. Although the degeneracy of the side-chain proton chemical shifts of this protein is quite severe, the degeneracy of the backbone proton chemical shift (HN and Ha) is not. Using the intraresidue and sequential NOE cross-peaks as the internal references, the peak-to-peak alignment enabled us to obtain unambiguous assignments in most cases. In addition, the symmetry feature of a pair of HNi-HNj or Hai-Haj NOE cross-peaks at two different 15N or 13 C planes with respect to the diagonal was utilized to

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation E. coli JM101 harboring pMON-CRBP II plasmid DNA (Li et al., 1987) was used to express the 13C, 15N-enriched, the 15N-enriched and the non-labeled CRBP II proteins. The doubly and singly labeled proteins were expressed following the protocol described by Hodsdon et al. (1995). The expressed proteins were puri®ed and delipidated as described (Li et al., 1989; Cheng et al., 1991). The puri®ed and delipidated protein was shown to bind alltrans retinol with high af®nity by ¯uorescence titration (Cheng et al., 1991) at pH 7.4 and 6.5. Analysis of the puri®ed protein by automated Edman degradation indicated that 80 % of the sample retained the initiating methionine. For NMR studies, a puri®ed protein sample was concentrated to 1-2 mM using a 5 ml Amicon ®lter (Amicon, Inc, MA) and exchanged at least four times with a phosphate buffer in either 99.9 % 2H2O (Isotech,

Structure and Dynamics of apo-CRBP II in Solution ensure unambiguous assignments (Hodsdon et al., 1996). Subsequently, all possible interpretations within a tolerance (not larger than 0.04 ppm) for each of the remaining cross-peaks were ®ltered using the newly de®ned secondary structure, and those agreeing with the secondary structure were selected. Finally, NOE constraints responsible for the tertiary fold were identi®ed from the remaining cross-peaks. Peak-to-peak alignment and the symmetry-check were again used to eliminate ambiguity in the assignment. A total of 2258 NOE constraints were identi®ed, and 1740 of them were unique constraints, including 700, 476, 131 and 433 intraresidue, sequential, medium and long-range NOE constraints, respectively. These constraints were interpreted conservatively and were given an upper Ê bound of 5 A plus any prochiral corrections. All peptide bonds were ®xed to the trans con®guration, as de®ned by the dihedral angle  at 180(Æ5)  . In addition, the backbone dihedral angles È and É of the six residues (E18 to A23) in the a-helix I region, as identi®ed by both the CSI and respective mediumrange NOE constraints, were ®xed at À60(Æ20)  and À40(Æ20)  , respectively, as described (Hodsdon et al., 1996). The 1740 unambiguously assigned constraints served as an input for the calculation of an ensemble of tertiary structures that established the global fold of CRBP II. After the global fold was established, additional NOE constraints were identi®ed using an iterative procedure as described before (Hodsdon et al., 1996). In essence, the NMR model re®ned from the last cycle of the iteration would be used to select additional distance restraints. The selection was made over the entire NOE constraint list, which contains all interpretations at a given chemical shift tolerance for all the NOE cross-peaks. Here, the tolerance was set to 0.04 ppm. Relaxation and model-free parameter calculations The peak intensities were measured for the calculation of the relaxation parameters. The 15N T1 was obtained by ®tting the intensities at 28, 112, 224, 337, 449, 617 and 786 ms with a single exponential function. The 15N T2 was obtained by ®tting the intensities at 16, 31, 47, 78, 109, 140 and 171 ms with a single exponential function. The steady-state NOE were obtained from the ratio of the peak intensities observed with and without 1H saturation. The backbone dynamic information was extracted from the three relaxation parameters using the modelfree formalism (Lipari & Szabo, 1982) and its extended form (Clore et al., 1990), assuming that the overall rotation of the molecule is isotropic in solution, as described previously (Hodsdon & Cistola, 1997b). Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates of the ®nal 24 structures of apo-CRBP II and the distance restraints used to calculate the ®nal ensemble have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 1b4m and r1b4mmr, respectively.
