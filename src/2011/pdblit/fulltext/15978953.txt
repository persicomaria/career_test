Chloroquine Binds in the Cofactor Binding Site of Plasmodium falciparum Lactate Dehydrogenase ­ A Response
Studies on the crystal structure of the complex formed between chloroquine (CQ) and Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) have recently been described by J.A. Read et al.1, who also assessed the significance of this interaction in considering PfLDH as a target for structure-based design of novel antimalarials. While it is important to analyse the complex of antimalarial CQ with PfLDH, the use of these studies for developing antimalarials warrants caution: PfLDH is not found in the food vacuole of P. falciparum, which is the proposed site of action of CQ. CQ is unique with respect to P. falciparum because, owing to its weak base property, from nanomolar levels in the plasma, it becomes hyperconcentrated (to millimolar levels) in the food vacuole2. It is proposed that CQ exerts its effect in the food vacuole by forming a complex with heme that then either blocks the growing heme polymer3 or the enzymatically4 or nonenzymatically5,6 mediated formation of hemozoin. It appears that the CQ mode of action is through heme. We also proposed that CQ inhibits heme-dependent protein synthesis in the parasite, which is an early event mediating the growth-inhibitory effects of the drug7. Thus, if PfLDH is absent from the food vacuole, then it may not be a primary target for CQ action. However, binding of CQ to PfLDH may be one of the several secondary events contributing to the mechanism of CQ action.

Our article1 describes the interaction of chloroquine (CQ) with Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH), but does not claim that this is the primary action of the drug. Indeed, the mediocre level of the Ki reported for the interaction (1 mM) argues against this being an effective route to parasiticidal activity. The crucial role of PfLDH in the life cycle of the parasite2 is, however, likely to ensure some secondary activity via this target. Our primary interest is the development of novel antimalarial compounds. The parasite relies heavily on homolactic fermentation as a source of energy3; compounds that inhibit PfLDH, a key metabolic enzyme in this pathway, also kill the parasite4 (S.L. Croft, pers. commun.). The analysis of CQ binding was instigated by a report that this compound interacted specifically with PfLDH5. Our studies show that this binding is competitive with the NADH cofactor and, hence, is inhibitory for enzyme activity. The quinolines form an extensive and synthetically accessible series of compounds. Our study defines routes for further modification of this molecular scaffold that could lead to potent and selective inhibition of PfLDH. The weak base property of CQ is derived chiefly from the tertiary amine group in the alkyl diamine extension from the 1-position of the quinoline ring. However, this group is disordered within the crystal structure, Parasitology Today, vol. 16, no. 3, 2000 implying no important contacts are made between this moiety and the enzyme. Our interpretation is that other quinoline derivatives that lack this function, and, therefore, are not dibasic and will not concentrate significantly within the food vacuole of the parasite, may also display PfLDH-moderated antimalarial activity.
