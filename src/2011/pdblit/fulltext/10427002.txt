liferation may eliminate undesired cells in the donor cell population. Similar cell culture strategies may be used to extend this approach to other somatic precursor cells. The availability of human ES cells and the possibility of generating autologous ES cells by nuclear transfer provide exciting perspectives for the treatment of human diseases. The efficient generation of ES cell­ derived glial cells and their use in a neonatal myelin disease model indicates that this strategy might eventually be applicable to human neurological disorders. Although cell replacement in adult inflammatory myelin diseases such as multiple sclerosis poses additional problems, further optimization of the donor ES cells such as targeted inactivation of disease-related genes or overexpression of factors promoting cell migration and survival may help to meet these challenges.

Two-Metal-Ion Catalysis in Adenylyl Cyclase

Adenylyl cyclase (AC) converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates many cellular functions. Recent structural studies have revealed much about the structure and function of mammalian AC but have not fully defined its active site or catalytic mechanism. Four crystal structures were determined of the catalytic domains of AC in complex with two different ATP analogs and various divalent metal ions. These structures provide a model for the enzyme-substrate complex and conclusively demonstrate that two metal ions bind in the active site. The similarity of the active site of AC to those of DNA polymerases suggests that the enzymes catalyze phosphoryl transfer by the same twometal-ion mechanism and likely have evolved from a common ancestor. Mammalian ACs are integral membrane proteins that catalyze the synthesis of the second messenger adenosine 3 ,5 -monophosphate (cAMP) from ATP.

ways converge on and regulate the enzyme (1), including those of heterotrimeric GTPbinding proteins (G proteins), which couple the activation of heptahelical receptors on the cell surface to subsequent changes in AC activity. G proteins bind directly to the catalytic core of AC, which consists of two homologous cytoplasmic domains, C1a and C2a. These domains can be expressed as independent polypeptides in Escherichia coli and, when mixed, form a heterodimer that exhibits catalytic activity as well as sensitivity to Gs and Gi , the stimulatory and inhibitory G protein subunits (2­ 4). We recently determined the crystal structure of a complex between Gs and the C1a: C2a heterodimer (Fig. 1A) and proposed a

mechanism for AC activation by the subunit (5). By soaking crystals of the complex with the inhibitor 2 -deoxy-3 -AMP pyrophosphate (2 -d-3 -AMP PPi), we also located the active site of AC (Fig. 1B). Upon binding, the inhibitor induces the collapse of several conserved loops to form the active site of the enzyme. Modeling studies predict that the binding of ATP elicits a similar conformational change from "open" to "closed." However, a catalytic mechanism for the synthesis of cAMP was not obvious from the 2 -d-3 -AMP PPi­inhibited structure. In particular, the active site lacked either an obvious catalytic base, which would abstract a proton from the 3 hydroxyl of ATP, or a second metal ion, which would be conFig. 1. Complexes of ATP analog inhibitors with the catalytic core of AC (31). (A) The C1a:C2a catalytic core of AC viewed along its pseudotwofold axis toward what is believed to be the cytoplasmic face of the molecule. Forskolin (FSK) and ATP, which bind between the C1a (tan) and C2a (mauve) domains, are shown as stick models. The switch II helix of Gs , which forms much of the interface with AC, is depicted as a red rod. (B) Model of ATP bound in the active site. The side chain of N1025 is modeled after its conformation in the AC ATP S-Rp Mn structure (Fig. 1D), whereas all other elements are those of the AC LddATP Mn structure (Fig. 1C).

For clarity, the image has been rotated slightly from the view in the left panel. The green and purple wire cages represent electron density contoured at 5 for 3.0 Å FoZn FoMg and 2.8 Å FoMn FoMg omit maps, respectively, demonstrating that Zn2 preferentially binds at site A and Mn2 at site B.

sistent with both kinetic models of enzyme activity and recent information obtained from mutagenesis studies (6). The reaction catalyzed by AC is similar to those of DNA polymerases. Both enzymes catalyze the attack of the 3 hydroxyl of ribose on the phosphate of a nucleoside triphosphate. Despite no obvious sequence homology, the enzymes do possess similar domains (7). Of the four known families of DNA polymerases, three have a core "palm" domain composed of a motif. At distinct topological locations within this motif are two invariant aspartic acid residues that coordinate two catalytic metal ions (8 ­ 10). The C1a and C2a domains of AC also contain a motif, but only C1a bears

the analogous aspartic acids. If AC is indeed related to DNA polymerases (7) and if its reaction is catalyzed by the same mechanism, then two catalytic metal ions are also expected to bind to the C1a domain of AC. Mutation of the two aspartic acids in C1a should be as catalytically devastating as the analogous mutations in DNA polymerases (11). To define the active site of AC unambiguously, we determined structures of AC in complex with the competitive substrate analogs: -L-2 ,3 -dideoxyadenosine 5 -triphosphate ( -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP), which has a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 24 nM with native enzyme from rat brain (12), and adenosine 5 -( -thio)-triphosphate (Rp) (ATP S-Rp), which has an IC50 of 1 M

with the soluble AC used in these crystallographic studies (13, 14). Crystals of the Gs : C1a:C2a complex were soaked with various combinations of ATP analogs and metal ions (15). Four structures were ultimately deter-L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP mined: Gs :C1a:C2a 2Mg2 (AC LddATP Mg), Gs :C1a:C2a Mn2 (AC -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP Mg2 LddATP Mn), Gs :C1a:C2a -L-2 ,3 -dd5 -ATP Mg2 Zn2 (AC LddATP Zn), and Gs :C1a:C2a ATP S-Rp Mg2 Mn2 (AC ATP S-Rp Mn) (Table 1). In each case, the AC catalytic core was in the closed conformation previously described for the complex of Gs :C1a:C2a with the inhibitor 2 -d-3 -AMP PPi (5). -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP contains a ribose moiety with opposite absolute configuration of that in ATP. Even so, -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 ATP occupies the active site in a similar fashion to 2 -d-3 -AMP PPi, with the purine ring binding in a pocket formed between the C1a and C2a domains and the and phosphates binding the P loop in a similar fashion as PPi (Fig. 1C). The lack of 2 and 3 hydroxyls allows the ribose ring of -L-2 ,3 dd-5 -ATP to pack snugly against the C2a domain, which explains the enhanced binding of this inhibitor relative to its fully substituted analogs (12). In the AC LddATP Mg structure, -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP appears to bind as a complex with two metal ions. The first metal (metal A) is coordinated by the pro-R oxygen of the phosphate, a carboxylate oxygen from each of the invariant aspartic acid residues [Asp396 (D396) and D440], and a water molecule. The four ligands form a tetrahedral coordination sphere. The second metal (metal B) was previously observed in the 2 -d-3 -AMP PPi complex with Gs :C1a:C2a and is octahedrally coordinated by one oxygen from each aspartic acid; an unesterified oxygen from each of the , , and phosphates; and the backbone carbonyl of Ile397. Addition of Zn2 to generate AC LddATP Zn, or of Mn2 to generate AC LddATP Mn, increases the electron density at the A or B sites, respectively (Fig. 1C). These data conclusively demonstrate that there are two metal ion binding sites in the active site of AC. Although both are presumably occupied by Mg2 in the cell, the specificity of the two metal sites for Mn2 or Zn2 , which have identical charge and similar ionic radii, probably reflects the number and stereochemistry of the coordinating ligands. Accordingly, Zn2 , which readily accommodates four ligands, preferentially binds at site A, whereas Mn2 , which prefers octahedral coordination, binds at site B. Mn2 is an activator of AC, whereas Zn2 is an inhibitor [IC50 15 M (13)]. Although Zn2 does not generally inhibit two-metal-ion­ utilizing enzymes (16 ­18), it does inhibit several DNA and RNA polymerases (19). In these enzymes and AC, Zn2 may perturb the coordination of the reactive groups and thus affect enzyme activity. These changes may not be evident in AC LddATP Zn where there is no 3 hydroxyl to coordinate metal A. The structure of the AC ATP S-Rp Mn complex rationalizes the potent inhibitory properties that result from substitution of a thiol group for the Rp phosphate oxygen and reveals additional features that likely exist in the active site of an AC ATP complex. Two metal ions are also apparent in the structure of this complex (Fig. 1D). The coordinating ligands for metal B are the same as in the AC LddATP structures, except that a sulfur is substituted for the pro-R oxygen on the phosphate. Metal A has only four obvious ligands: the sulfur atom of ATP S-Rp, one oxygen from each aspartic acid, and a water molecule positioned transaxial to the oxygen ligand donated by D440. There are probably additional water ligands that are not apparent because of disorder or the resolution of the experiment. The thiotriphosphate of

Diffraction data from crystals of Gs :C1a:C2a complexes were measured on a 2k 2k ADSC Quantum 4 charge-coupled device area detector using 0.923 Å radiation from the F1 beam line at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). All crystals were flash-frozen in nitrogen-cooled liquid propane on 0.1 to 0.2-mm cryoloops (Hampton) and were maintained throughout data collection in an MSC cryostream at 180°C. With a 0.1-mm collimator, the mosaicity for crystals of the complex was typically 0.5°. Diffraction amplitudes from crystals of the complex were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM (32) and scaled using SCALA of the CCP4 programming suite (33).

round of rigid body refinement, Powell minimization, and simulated annealing with CNS (34), the program O (35) was used to fit inhibitors and metal ions into positive difference density in the active site. The models were subsequently refined for multiple rounds in CNS. Anisotropic overall B factors and a bulk solvent mask were used throughout refinement. No residues in any of the four models are found in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Because the Gs used in the current study had been treated with trypsin, there are notable differences in Gs between the structures reported here and previously determined structures of Gs :C1a:C2a. By comparing electron density maps, trypsin appears to cut after R38 of bovine Gs , cleaving the NH2-terminal helix from the protein, and after R389 at the end of 5. The latter cut results in an alternate conformation for the COOH-terminal residues of the protein.

ATP S-Rp is well ordered and the sulfur is about 3 Å from each metal ion. It is therefore unclear whether the sulfur serves as a ligand for either metal. Even though each phosphorous atom of ATP S-Rp resides in a similar position to those of -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP, the overall conformation of their triphosphate moieties is distinct (compare Fig. 1, C and D). The conformation of the ATP S thiotriphosphate helps accommodate the bulkier sulfur atom by rotating the phosphate slightly up from its position in -L-2 ,3 -dd5 -ATP. However, this results in distorted coordination geometry for both metals. The ribose moiety of the inhibitor is poorly ordered, perhaps because the sulfur atom precludes the 3 hydroxyl of the inhibitor from binding metal A. The 3 hydroxyl is not in position for attack on the phosphate. An aspargine at position 1025 in type II AC is conserved in all adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases (Fig. 1D). Mutation of this residue in type II AC reduces the catalytic constant 30 to 100 times but does not dramatically affect the Michaelis constant (Km) for ATP (20). Although several alternative roles have been proposed for this residue (5, 20, 21), the structure of AC ATP S-Rp Mn demonstrates that Asn1025 forms a hydrogen bond with the O4 oxygen of ribose. Mutation of this residue could result in misorientation of the substrate in the active site. We expect the purine and triphosphate moieties of -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP to resemble closely those of ATP in an enzyme-substrate complex. Although the orientation of the ribose ring of ATP is expected to differ from that of ATP S-Rp in the AC ATP S-Rp Mn complex, we still expect the O4 oxygen of ATP to form a hydrogen bond with Asn1025. In addition, metal A likely serves as a Lewis acid that enhances the nucleophilicity of the 3 hydroxyl of ATP. With these constraints, a model for the substrate ATP can be built such that the 3 hydroxyl of ribose is 2 Å from metal A and is positioned for in-line attack on the phosphate (Fig. 1B). The coordination sphere of metal A is roughly square pyramidal in our AC ATP model complex. The ligands are the 3 hydroxyl, the pro-R unesterified oxygen of the phosphate, a carboxylate oxygen from D396 and D440, and a water molecule analogous to that observed in the structure of AC ATP S-Rp Mn (Fig. 1D). Due to close contacts with the 3 hydroxyl and the C atom of Cys441, it is not clear whether there is room for a second water ligand for metal A as there is in T7 DNA polymerase (T7DNAP) and Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I (TAQP) (8, 10). The structure of the product cAMP, as it is observed in small molecule crystal structures (22), is incompatible with the active site of AC when optimally superimposed on ATP. Its phosphate moiety overlaps with metal A and D440, which may explain why cAMP is preferentially released from the active site before the other product, PPi (23). To test the role of the two invariant aspartic acid residues in the active site of AC, each was mutated to alanine and asparagine, alone and in combination, to generate the eight (31) mutants D396A, D396N, D440A, D440N, D396A/D440A, D396N/D440N, D396N/ D440A, and D396A/D440N. Residues analogous to D396 and D440 have been previously mutated to alanine in ACs, but not in the system employed for our crystallographic studies and not in the same protein, preventing a meaningful comparison of their effects (21, 24). As was the case for the analogous mutations in T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) and human immunodeficiency virus type I reverse transcriptase (HIVRT), all of the mutations were largely inactivating (11) (Table 2). No activity was observed for any of the double mutants. Activity for each of the single mutants was reduced approximately 2000 times with the physiological metal Mg2 and 200 times with Mn2 . For all the single mutants, Km was increased 2- to 10-fold. For both D396 and D440 there is no discernable difference in limiting rate constant (Vmax) or Km for ATP between the alanine and asparagine mutants. However, mutations at D440 were only half as detrimental to the Km than were mutations at D396. Therefore, D396 may play a more important role in binding substrate. D440 is unlikely to be a general base, as suggested previously, because mutation of this residue does not abrogate activity and no more so than mutation of D396. The remarkable similarity of the fold in AC to those of the palm domains of T7DNAP, HIVRT, and TAQP, as well as the bacteriophage polymerase homolog gp43, is equally striking at the molecular level (25). The active sites of these enzymes are supported by a platform of four strands. A P loop following the first of these creates the triphosphate binding site. Two conserved aspartate residues coordinate two metal ions in identical fashion, and the distinct metal preferences of the two sites are the same in AC and T7DNAP (8). Hence, like phosphatases, exonucleases, ribozymes, and polymerases (8, 16, 18, 26), AC employs a two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism. Conservation of both fold and mechanism suggests a common evolutionary origin for the AC and PolI family catalytic domains. Both DNA polymerases and AC undergo a transition from an open to a closed conformational state upon binding nucleotide substrates (25, 27). In DNA polymerases, the transition involves the collapse of the socalled "fingers" domain on the palm domain. In AC, several loops, including a rudimentary fingers domain, collapse around ATP to form the competent active site. In each enzyme, the collapse brings basic residues into the active site that stabilize the triphosphate of the substrate, the pentavalent phosphate transition state of the reaction, and the pyrophosphate leaving group. For polymerases, the conformational change appears crucial to the fidelity (28) and processivity (29) of the reaction. In AC, active site closure is required to

Site-directed mutagenesis of the C1a domain of type V AC was performed using the Quickchange (Stratagene) mutagenesis kit (30). Overlapping antiparallel pairs of mutagenic oligonucleotides encompassing regions of pQE60H6-VCI (2) that code for residues D396 or D440 were used. The sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotides are available by request. Double mutants were generated by successive mutagenesis.

Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured after activation of the enzyme by Gs GTP S. IIC2 (2 M) was reconstituted with wild-type VC1 (2 nM) or mutant VC1 (20 nM). All assays were performed in the presence of 5 mM (free) Mg2 . Where noted, Mn2 was present at 5 mM. Double mutants have negligible activity, and values for kinetic constants could not be determined.

achieve a productive and substrate-specific catalytic complex, and this induced-fit mechanism provides a direct opportunity for allosteric regulation. In analogy to an allosteric dimer, the active site of AC is formed at the interface between dyad-related homologous domains. Thus, AC provides two symmetrically related binding sites for the homologous G proteins Gs and Gi (4, 5). We suggest that Gs facilitates collapse of the active-site loops from C1a and C2a around the substrate ATP to form an competent active site, whereas Gi hinders such collapse and stabilizes an open, inactive conformation of the enzyme.

The recombinant C1a domain from canine type V AC, the C2a domain from rat type II AC, and bovine Gs were expressed in E. coli and purified as previously GTP S described (30). Gs was activated with Mg2 and then subjected to limited proteolysis by trypsin. Crystals of the ternary complex between C1a, C2a, and Gs were grown as previously described (5). All crystals were harvested in cryoprotectant (5) to which was added various combinations of inhibitors and metal ions, described as follows: for AC LddATP Mg, 5 mM MgCl2 and 380 M -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP; for AC LddATP Mn, 250 M MgCl2, 500 M MnCl2, and 380 M -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP; for AC LddATP Zn, 250 M MgCl2, 500 M ZnCl2, and 380 M -L-2 ,3 -dd-5 -ATP; for AC ATP S-Rp Mn, 500 M MgCl2, 500 M MnCl2, and 1 mM ATP SLddATP Mg, AC LddATP Rp. Crystals of AC Mn, and AC LddATP Zn were soaked for 1 to 2 hours; the conformation of AC in these complexes was closed. AC ATP S-Rp Mn was soaked for 6 hours to achieve a closed conformation; 2-hour soaks resulted in structures of the open conformation of AC. AC complexes with inhibitors such as ATP Zn2 , ATP S-Sp Zn2 , and 2 -iodo-ATP Mg2 also adopt the open conformation, and each metal site exhibits the same preference for either Mn2 or Zn2 as observed in the closed conformation (13). Strong electron density is observed for the and phosphates of these inhibitors in the presence of Mg2 alone or of Mn2 and Mg2 , and for the entire triphosphate in the presence of Zn2 and Mg2 . Much weaker density corresponding to a purine ring is observed in the purine binding pocket of these complexes. However, the purine and triphosphate densities are not continuous, and a single model of ATP cannot be built to accommodate both purine and triphosphate binding sites. E. E. Kim and H. W. Wyckoff, J.

Staphylococcus aureus Sortase, an Enzyme that Anchors Surface Proteins to the Cell Wall
Sarkis K. Mazmanian, Gwen Liu, Hung Ton-That, Olaf Schneewind*
Surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria are linked to the bacterial cell wall by a mechanism that involves cleavage of a conserved Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG) motif and that occurs during assembly of the peptidoglycan cell wall. A Staphylococcus aureus mutant defective in the anchoring of surface proteins was isolated and shown to carry a mutation in the srtA gene. Overexpression of srtA increased the rate of surface protein anchoring, and homologs of srtA were found in other pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. The protein specified by srtA, sortase, may be a useful target for the development of new antimicrobial drugs. Hospital isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis have become resistant to most, if not

all, known therapeutic regimens (1). Many antibiotics, including penicillin and its derivatives, target the transpeptidation reaction of bacterial cell wall synthesis, which cross-links peptidoglycan strands (2). To search for other cell wall synthesis reactions that may serve as targets for antimicrobial therapy, we have focused on the anchoring of surface proteins to the peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria.
