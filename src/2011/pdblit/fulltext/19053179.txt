The (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct of trans-4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) was incorporated into the duplex 5-d(GCTAGCXAGTCC)-3·5-d(GGACTAGCTAGC)-3 [X ) (6S,8R,11S) HNE-dG], in which the lesion was mismatched opposite dAdo. The (6S,8R,11S) adduct maintained the ring-closed 1,N2HNE-dG structure. This was in contrast to when this adduct was correctly paired with dCyd, conditions under which it underwent ring opening and rearrangement to diastereomeric minor groove cyclic hemiacetals [Huang, H., Wang, H., Qi, N., Lloyd, R. S., Harris, T. M., Rizzo, C. J., and Stone, M. P. (2008) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130, 10898-10906]. The (6S,8R,11S) adduct exhibited a syn/anti conformational equilibrium about the glycosyl bond. The syn conformation was predominant in acidic solution. Structural analysis of the syn conformation revealed that X7 formed a distorted base pair with the complementary protonated A18. The HNE moiety was located in the major groove. Structural perturbations were observed at the neighbor C6·G19 and A8·T17 base pairs. At basic pH, the anti conformation of X7 was the major species. The 1,N2-HNE-dG intercalated and displaced the complementary A18 in the 5-direction, resulting in a bulge at the X7·A18 base pair. The HNE aliphatic chain was oriented toward the minor groove. The Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding of the neighboring A8·T17 base pair was also disrupted. Introduction
trans-4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE)1 is produced from the metabolism of membrane lipids (1), and it is the major in vivo peroxidation product of -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (2, 3). Several routes for the formation of HNE from -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been described (4-6). HNE forms Michael addition adducts with protein Cys, His, and Lys residues, which can further rearrange to cyclic hemiacetals (2, 7-11). Many of the cytotoxic effects attributed to HNE involve alteration in gene expression and cell signaling to cell proliferation and apoptosis (12-18), and these are associated with the etiology of human disease arising as a result of oxidative stress, for example, Alzheimer's disease (19), Parkinson's disease (20), arteriosclerosis (21), and hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury (22). Michael addition of the N2-amino group of dGuo to HNE gives four diastereomeric HNE-derived 1,N2-dGuo (1,N2-HNEdGuo) adducts (Figure 1) (23-26), which have been detected in cellular DNA (27-33). Wang et al. (34, 35) synthesized the four stereoisomers of the exocyclic 1,N2-HNEdGuo dG adduct and incorporated them into 5-d(GCTAGCXAGTCC)-3·5d(GGACTCGCTAGC)-3, in which X denotes the 1,N2-HNE* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

dGuo adduct. When placed opposite dCyd in duplex DNA, the exocyclic 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adducts underwent ring opening at the N1 imine nitrogen of dGuo, thus exposing the Watson-Crick base pairing face of the adducted dG. The diastereomeric (6S,8R,11S) and (6R,8S,11R) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adducts in fact existed primarily as minor groove cyclic hemiacetals when placed into this duplex (Scheme 1) (36). The initial ring opening of the 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adducts likely occurs via a mechanism similar to that proposed for the related 3-(2-deoxy- -D-erythropentofuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2-R]purin-10(3H)-one (M1dG) adduct (37, 38). It should also be noted that an alternative pathway to the formation of HNE-derived DNA adducts involves oxidation of HNE to 2,3-epoxy-4-hydroxynonanal, yielding etheno adducts (39-43). The potential to form DNA adducts (Figure 1) suggests that HNE may be genotoxic. HNE induces the SOS response in Escherichia coli (44). Chromosomal aberrations are observed

upon exposures to HNE in rodent (45, 46), mammalian (47, 48), and human (49) cells. In mammalian cells, the genotoxicity of HNE depends upon glutathione levels, which modulate the formation of HNE-DNA adducts (50-52). The mutational spectrum induced by HNE adducts in the lacZ gene of the single-stranded M13 phage transfected into wild-type E. coli revealed recombination events, CfT transitions, followed by GfC and AfC transversions, and frameshift mutations (25). HNE is mutagenic (53) and carcinogenic in rodent cells (54). Hussain et al. (55) reported that HNE caused GfT transversions at codon 249 of wild-type p53 in lymphosblastoid cells. Hu et al. (56) reported that HNE-DNA adducts were preferentially formed with guanine at the third base of codon 249 in the p53 gene. The mutational spectrum induced by HNE adducts in the supF gene of shuttle vector pSP189 replicated in human cells showed that HNE induced primarily GfT transversions, accompanied by lower levels of GfA transitions (57). Fernandes et al. (58) conducted site-specific mutagenesis studies and observed that the (6S,8R,11S) and (6R,8S,11R) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adducts were mutagenic, inducing low levels of GfT transversions and GfA transitions. The nucleotide excision repair pathway is involved in the excision of HNE-dG lesions (57, 59, 60). The propensity of the 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adducts to undergo ring opening when placed opposite dCyd in duplex DNA, potentially facilitating successful lesion bypass by Y-family polymerases, may account for the low levels of mutations associated with these lesions (58). Wolfle et al. (61) reported that the sequential activity of pols  and  bypassed the (6S,8R,11S) and (6R,8S,11R) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adducts. Significantly, pol  correctly inserted dCTP and to a lesser extent dTTP opposite the HNE adduct. Further extension was achieved in the presence of pol , which elongated from a dCyd: 1,N2-HNEdGuo template primer terminus (61). In the present work, the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct (36) has been examined as to structure in 5-d(GCTAGCXAGTCC)-3·5-d(GGACTAGCTAGC)-3, containing the X·dAdo mismatched sequence [X ) (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo], using NMR (Scheme 2). This duplex mimics the situation following incorrect incorporation of dATP opposite the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2HNE-dGuo adduct and leading to HNE-induced GfT transversions (55, 57, 58). Solution structures of the oligodeoxynucleotide duplex have been refined from NMR data collected as a function of pH. The (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct maintains the exocyclic structure when placed complementary to dAdo. The adduct undergoes a syn/anti conformational equilibrium about the glycosyl bond, as was predicted by Xing et al. (26). The syn conformation predominates in acidic solution. Structural analysis reveals that X7 forms a distorted base pair

with the complementary protonated A18. The HNE moiety is located in the major groove. Structural perturbations are observed at the neighbor C6·G19 and A8·T17 base pairs. At basic pH, the anti conformation of X7 is the major species. The 1,N2HNE-dGuo intercalates and displaces the complementary A18 in the 5-direction, resulting in a bulge at the X7·A18 base pair. The HNE aliphatic chain is oriented toward the minor groove. The Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding of the neighboring A8·T17 base pair is also disrupted.

Materials and Methods
Materials. The oligodeoxynucleotide 5-d(GGACTAGCTAGC)-3 was synthesized and purified by anion-exchange chromatography by the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct of (6S,8R,11S) configuration was incorporated into 5-d(GCTAGCXAGTCC)-3 [X ) (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo] as reported (34, 35). The oligodeoxynucleotides were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Capillary gel electrophoresis and C-18 HPLC were utilized to assess their purities. The oligodeoxynucleotides were desalted by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Oligodeoxynucleotide concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 260 nm, using calculated extinction coefficients for both sequences of 1.1 × 105 L mol-1 cm-1 (62). The strands were annealed at 1:1 stoichiometry in 10 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0). The solutions were heated to 95 °C for 10 min and cooled to room temperature. The duplex DNA was purified using DNA grade hydroxylapatite chromatography, with a gradient from 10 to 200 mM NaH2PO4 in 100 mM NaCl and 50 µM EDTA (pH 7.0), and desalted using Sephadex G-25. Melting Temperature. UV thermal melting profiles were collected as a function of pH with the oligodeoxynucleotides containing either the X7·C18 or the X7·A18 base pair in 100 mM NaCl buffer. The strand concentration was 10 nM. Data were

The temperature and the absorbance at 260 nm were read and stored at 1 min intervals from 10-70 °C. NMR. NMR experiments were performed at 1H frequencies of 600 and 800 MHz; the data at 800 MHz were collected using a cryogenic probe. Samples were at 1.0 mM strand concentration. Samples for the nonexchangeable protons were dissolved in 10 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0) to a volume of 280 µL. They were exchanged with D2O and suspended in 280 µL of 99.996% D2O. The pH was adjusted using dilute DCl or NaOD. The temperature was 15 °C. Samples for the observation of exchangeable protons were dissolved in 280 µL of the same buffer containing 9:1 H2O:D2O (v/v). The temperature was 5 °C. The 1H chemical shifts were referenced to water. Data were processed using FELIX 2000 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) on UNIX workstations (Dell Inc., Austin, TX). For all experiments, a relaxation delay of 1.5 s was used. The nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were recorded with 512 real data in the t2 dimension and 2048 real data in the t1 dimension. For assignment of exchangeable protons, NOESY experiments used the Watergate solvent suppression scheme (63). The mixing time was 250 ms. The spectrum was zero-filled during processing to create a matrix of 1024 × 512 real points. For assignment of nonexchangeable protons and the derivation of distance restraints, NOESY experiments used TPPI quadrature detection, and mixing times of 60, 150, 200, and 250 ms were used. The spectra were zero-filled during processing to create a matrix of 1024 × 1024 real points. The double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) experiments were performed with TPPI quadrature detection and presaturation of the residual water during the relaxation delay. 1 H-31P HMBC spectra (64, 65) were obtained at 25 °C. The data matrix was 96 (t1) × 1024 (t2) complex points. The data were Fourier transformed after zero filling in the t1 dimension, resulting in a matrix size of 128 (D1) × 512 (D2) real points. The 31P chemical shifts were not calibrated. Restraints. Footprints were drawn around cross-peaks obtained at a mixing time of 250 ms using FELIX2000. Identical footprints were transferred and fit to the corresponding cross-peaks obtained at the other two mixing times. Cross-peak intensities were determined by volume integrations. These were combined as necessary with intensities generated from complete relaxation matrix analysis of a starting structure to generate a hybrid intensity matrix (66, 67). MARDIGRAS (68-70) iteratively refined the hybrid intensity matrix and optimized agreement between calculated and experimental nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) intensities. The RANDMARDI algorithm carried out 50 iterations for each set of data, randomizing peak volumes within limits specified by the input noise level (70). Calculations were initiated using isotropic correlation times of 2, 3, and 4 ns, and with both A form and B form starting structures and the three mixing times, yielding 18 sets of distances. Analysis of these data yielded experimental distance restraints used in subsequent rMD calculations and the corresponding standard deviations for the distance restraints. Deoxyribose pseudorotational angles (P) were estimated by examining the 3JHH of sugar protons (71). The J1-2 and J1-2 couplings were measured from ECOSY spectra, while the intensities of H2-H3 and H3-H4 cross-peaks were determined from DQFCOSY spectra. The data were fit to curves relating the coupling constants to the deoxyribose pseudorotation (P), sugar pucker amplitude (), and the percentage S type conformation. The pseudorotation and amplitude ranges were converted to the five dihedral angles 0 to 4. Coupling constants measured from 1H-31P HMBC spectra were applied (72, 73) to the Karplus relationship (74) to determine the backbone dihedral angle  (C4-C3-O3-P), related to the H3-C3-O3-P angle by a 120° shift. The (C3O3-P-O5) backbone angles were calculated from the correlation between  and in B-DNA. rMD Calculations. The HNE-adducted duplexes, either in A form or B form DNA helical coordinates, were constructed by bonding the stereospecific HNE C1 and C3 to G7 N1 and G7 N2, respectively using Insight II.

Figure 2. (A) 1H NMR spectra of the mismatched duplex at different temperatures at pH 5.5. Two small resonances at 9.8 and 8.8 ppm at low temperature were assigned to the hydrogen-bonded and nonhydrogen-bonded amino protons of the protonated A18.

were obtained from density function theory (DFT) calculations using a neutral total charge, utilizing B3LYP/6-31G* basis set and the program GAUSSIAN (75). To obtain the A form and B form starting structures that were used for subsequent restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) calculations, these A form or B form modified duplexes were energy minimized using 200 iterations with the conjugate gradients algorithm, in the absence of experimental restraints. Distance restraints were divided into classes weighted according to the error assessed in their measurements. Class 1, class 2, class 3, class 4, and class 5 were calculated from completely resolved, somewhat overlapped, slightly overlapped, medium overlapped, or heavily overlapped cross-peaks, respectively, which were at least 0.5 ppm from the water resonance or the diagonal line of the spectrum. Class 5 also included all other cross-peaks. NOEs that did not have a distance calculated by MARDIGRAS were estimated by the relative peak intensities. The spectroscopic data indicated that the duplexes conserved Watson-Crick base pairing, so empirical restraints preserving Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding and preventing propeller twisting between base pairs were used (76). Empirical backbone and deoxyribose torsion angle restraints derived from B-DNA were used (77). The potential energy wells associated with the dihedral angle restraints were (30°. The force constants of the restraints were scaled from 3.2 to 32 kcal mol-1 Å-2 during the first 10 ps and were maintained at 32 kcal mol-1 Å-2 for the remainder of the simulations. Ten sets of randomly seeded rMD calculations (five from A and five from B type DNA starting structures) were conducted using the program AMBER (version 8.0) (78) and the parm99 force field.

The Hawkins, Cramer, Truhlar pairwise generalized Born (GB) model (79, 80) was used to simulate implicit waters. The parameters developed by Tsui and Case (81) were used. The cutoff radius for nonbonding interactions was 18 Å. The restraint energy function contained terms describing distance and torsion angle restraints, both in the form of square well potentials. Bond lengths involving hydrogens were fixed with the SHAKE algorithm (82). A 1000step energy minimization was performed with an integrator time of 1 fs without experimental restraints, followed by a 100000iteration simulated annealing protocol with an integrator time step of 1 fs. The system was heated to 600 K in 5000 iterations and kept at 600 K for 5000 iterations, then cooled to 100 K with a time constant of 4.0 ps over 80000 iterations. A final cooling was applied to relax the system to 0 K with a time constant of 1.0 ps over 10000 iterations. Convergence was assessed for structures having the lowest number of deviations from the experimental distance and dihedral restraints, lowest van der Waals energies, and the lowest overall energies. Finally, the 10 refined structures were energy minimized for 250 iterations without restraints to obtain average structures. The program CORMA (67) was utilized to calculate the predicted NOE intensities from the structures refined from rMD calculations. Input volumes (intensities) were normalized from the intensities of protons with fixed intranuclear distances (i.e., cytosine H5-H6 and thymine CH3-H6 distances). Random noise was added to all intensities to simulate spectral noise. An isotropic correlation time (c) of 3 ns was used. The rotation of thymidine CH3 groups was modeled using a three-jump site model (83). A sixth root residual (R1x) factor (84) was calculated for each structure. Helicoidal analysis was carried out with the program 3DNA (85).

Characterization of the Mismatched Duplex. The 5d(GCTAGCXAGTCC)-3·5-d(GGACTAGCTAGC)-3 (X )

1,N2-HNE-dGuo) oligodeoxynucleotide was characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, capillary gel electrophoresis, and C-18 HPLC. It was obtained at >95% purity. However, at pH 7.3, two sets of NMR resonances that exhibited exchange cross-peaks on the NMR time scale were observed. The data suggested that the mismatched duplex adopted two conformations. The COSY spectra exhibited seven cytosine H5fH6 correlations in acidic, neutral, or basic solutions. The COSY spectra at neutral or basic conditions were similar, suggesting that the major conformation in neutral solution was similar to that in basic solution. Furthermore, the C6 H5fH6 correlation was broad in acidic and neutral solutions whereas it was sharp in basic solution, suggesting in the acidic and neutral solutions that the mismatched duplex underwent a slow conformational exchange involving the adduct region. Shifting the pH to 5.5 or to 8.9 yielded spectra suitable for structural refinement. The resolution of the NMR spectra in acidic solution remained somewhat compromised by resonance broadening, but resonance assignments could be made. The resolutions of NMR spectra obtained in basic solution were outstanding. Hence, subsequent NMR experiments were performed at either acidic or basic pH, in an effort to characterize the two conformational species that were present in equilibrium at neutral pH. Mismatched X·A Duplex at pH 5.5. Thermal Melting (Tm) Experiments. The Tm of the mismatched duplex at pH 5.5 was 37 °C, lower than that of the corresponding duplex containing X7·C18 base pair, which was 40 °C. 1H NMR spectra of the mismatched duplex at different temperatures in acidic solution are shown in Figure 2A. No imino resonance was assigned to X7. The imino resonances of the neighboring C6·G19 and A8·T17 base pairs broadened more rapidly than did the imino resonances of the nucleotides located in the middle of the duplex.

Figure 5. NOE connectivity of the base imino protons. (A) The NOE spectrum at pH 5.5. (B) The NOE spectrum at pH 8.9. No imino resonance was observed for X7 in either spectrum, indicating that X7 maintained the 1,N2-HNE-dGuo structure. The T17 imino proton was also missing at pH 8.9.

Nonexchangeable Protons. The sequential NOE assignment of the nonexchangeable protons was accomplished using standard protocols (86, 87). The sequential NOEs between the aromatic (note that the X7 aromatic proton is designated as H2) and the anomeric protons are displayed in Figure 3A,B. Complete sequential NOESY connectivities without an interruption were observed for both modified and complementary strands. Notably, A18 H8 was the most downfield among the adenine aromatic protons, and X7 H2 was the most upfield among the guanine aromatic protons. The A18 H8 and A18 H2 resonances were observed at 8.42 and 7.03 ppm. These peaks became weaker at pH 7.3 and disappeared at pH 8.9. The T17 H6 resonance was observed at 7.37 ppm. The C6 H1fX7 H2, X7 H1fA8 H8, and T17 H1fA18 H8 NOEs were weaker as compared to other internucleotide deoxyribose H1fpurine H8 NOEs. In contrast, the X7 H2fX7 H1 NOE, which overlapped with the T3 H6fT3 H1 NOE, was very strong. The overlapped NOE cross-peak was comparable in intensity to the cytosine H5fH6 correlations in the spectrum with 60 ms mixing time (Figure 4A). The deoxyribose sugar proton resonances were assigned by utilizing a combination of DQF-COSY and NOESY spectra. As compared with the other H2 protons, X7 H2 shifted downfield. The assignments of the nonexchangeable protons are provided in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Exchangeable Protons. The base imino protons were assigned based on their sequential connectivities in NOESY spectra (Figure 5A), and these assignments were supported by their NOE cross-peaks to Watson-Crick base-paired amino protons (88). Because the X7 imino resonance was missing, no NOEs arising from the X7 imino proton were observed. The mismatched duplex exhibited two broad resonances at 9.8 and 8.8 ppm at low temperatures. They broadened further at higher

temperature and disappeared at 25 °C (Figure 2A). These resonances had NOE correlations with T17 CH3, T17 N3H, G19 N1H, and G19 N2H and were assigned to hydrogen-bonded and nonbonded amino protons of the protonated A18, respectively (76). Another weak resonance was observed at 9.6 ppm at low temperature (Figure 2A). It was also temperature-dependent and exhibited a weak NOE correlation with the resonance at 8.55 ppm at 5 °C. These two resonances were assigned to the amino protons of the partially protonated C6 (89). The NOE cross-peaks of the imino protons arising from Watson-Crick base pairing for C2·G23, T3·A22, A4·T21, G5·C20, C6·G19, A8·T17, G9·C16, T10·A15, and C11·G14 base pairs were observed. HNE Protons. X7 H8 exhibited strong NOE correlations with 6 C H6 (Figure 3A) and C6 H5 (Figure 6A). Other HNE protons were assigned based on the NOE correlations with 60 ms mixing time (Figure 6A). The resonances of X7 H7 geminal protons were well-resolved. X7 H7R, which was in the cis-configuration with respect to X7 H8, exhibited a relatively stronger NOE with X7 H8. X7 H7 , which was in the trans-configuration with respect to X7 H8, had a relatively weaker correlation with X7 H8. X7 H6 exhibited strong NOEs with the X7 H7 and X7 H11 protons. X7 H11 had strong NOE correlations with X7 H12 and relatively weaker correlations with X7 H13. X7 H16 was the most upfield and exhibited a strong NOE cross-peak with X7 H15. X7 H14 was overlapped with X7 H7R. It exhibited strong NOE correlations with X7 H13 and X7 H15. These assignments were supported by COSY, DQF-COSY, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), and NOE correlations with nucleotide protons. The chemical shifts of the HNE protons are summarized in Table 1. Notably, the HNE protons exhibited NOE correlations with the C6 H5 and C6 H6 protons in the mismatched duplex.

Deoxyribose and Backbone Angle Conformations. Deoxyribose and backbone angle conformations were determined spectroscopically by DQF-COSY and 31P-H3 HMBC correlations. Evaluation of the DQF-COSY spectrum revealed that the pseudorotation of the sugar rings of all nucleotides except X7 and A18 was either C1-exo or C2-endo. Structural Refinement. A total of 414 distance restraints, including 239 intranucleotide and 175 internucleotide restraints,

were calculated from the intensities of NOE cross-peaks by MARDIGRAS. A total of 49 NOEs were assigned to HNE protons (Table 1). In addition, 50 empirical distance restraints defining Watson-Crick base pairing were used; their use was predicated upon inspection of the NMR data, which indicated that Watson-Crick base pairing was intact throughout the duplex except at the X7·A18 base pair. Finally, an additional 180 empirical backbone torsion angle restraints were used; these were based upon inspection of the NMR data, which suggested that the adducted duplex maintained the B type architecture. The A18 imino nitrogen N1 was protonated to allow formation of a hydrogen bond with X7, and empirical distance restraints were used to position the hydrogen bonds of the protonated X7·A18 base pair. Torsion angle restraints were not used at the protonated X7·A18 base pair (Table 2). The randomly seeded rMD calculations were performed starting with initial structures, which were created either with A or B form geometries. Pairwise rmsd analysis of emergent structures indicated that the calculations converged, irrespective of starting structure (Table 2). The accuracies of the emergent structures were evaluated by comparison of theoretical NOE intensities calculated by complete relaxation analysis for the refined structure, to the experimental NOE intensities, to yield sixth root residuals (R1x). This residual was less 0.1 for the modified duplex (Table 2), indicating that the refined structures provided an accurate depiction of the data. Analysis of rMD Structures. The backbone torsion angles of the refined structures showed the oligodeoxynucleotide remained in the B type geometry except for the adducted region. Expanded views of the average structure around the adducted region are shown in Figure 7A,B, and the base stacking at the modified region is demonstrated in Figure 8A,B. All nucleosides except X7 maintained the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond. The neighboring C6·G19 and A8·T17 base pairs were distorted, but Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding was conserved. X7 adopted the syn conformation about the glycosyl bond, and the torsion angle (O4-C1-N3-C2) was 106°. The protonated A18 adopted the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond and formed hydrogen bonds with X7. The HNE was located in the major groove and exposed to the solvent. Mismatched Duplex at pH 8.9. Thermal Melting Experiments. The Tm of the mismatched duplex at pH 8.9 was 32 °C, lower than that of the correctly paired duplex containing the X7·C18 base pair, which was 37 °C. Figure 2B shows the

temperature dependence of 1H NMR of the mismatched duplex. No imino resonance was assigned to X7. The G19 imino resonance from the 5-neighbor C6·G19 base pair broadened more rapidly than the imino resonances of the nucleotides located in the middle of the sequence. A resonance tentatively assigned as the T17 imino resonance from the 3-neighbor A8·T17 base pair was broad even at 5 °C. Nonexchangeable Protons. The sequential NOE assignment of the nonexchangeable protons was also accomplished using standard protocols (86, 87). The sequential NOEs between the aromatic and the anomeric protons are displayed in Figure 3C,D. Complete sequential NOESY connectivities without interruption or peak intensity differences were observed for both the modified and the complementary strands. The deoxyribose sugar proton resonances were assigned by utilizing a combination of DQFCOSY and NOESY spectra. The resonances of A18 H8 and A8 H2 were found at 8.20 and 7.89 ppm, respectively. In addition, a singlet at 6.91 ppm was assigned to T17 H6. It became smaller at pH 7.3 and almost disappeared at pH 5.5. The assignments of the nonexchangeable protons are provided in Table S2 in the Supporting Information. The chemical shifts of the mismatched duplex in basic solution were compared with the corresponding unmodified G7·A18 mismatched duplex. Large chemical shift perturbations were located at the adducted X7·A18 base pair and the neighboring C6·G19 and A8·T17 base pairs, indicating some perturbation at the adduct region. The chemical shifts were also compared with those in acidic solution. Large differences were also observed at the modified X7·A18 base pair and the neighboring C6·G19 and A8·T17 base pairs, suggesting large conformational differences between acidic and basic solutions were located at the adduct region. Exchangeable Protons. The resonances of the base imino protons were assigned based on their sequential connectivty in NOESY spectra (Figure 5B) and were supported by their NOE cross-peaks to Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded amino protons (88). X7 was not assigned an imino resonance. The T17 N3H resonance could not be assigned, although a broad resonance at 13.7 ppm was observed (Figure 2B) and located in the thymine imino region of the spectrum. The NOE cross-peaks of the imino protons arising from Watson-Crick base pairing

for C2·G23, T3·A22, A4·T21, G5·C20, C6·G19, G9·C16, T10·A15, and C11·G14 base pairs were observed. HNE Protons. X7 H8 exhibited strong NOEs with A8 H2 and A18 H2 (Figure 3C). Other HNE protons were also assigned based on the NOE correlations and the peak intensities at 60 ms mixing time (Figure 6B). In addition to the resonances of the geminal X7 H7 protons, the X7 H12 geminal protons were also resolved. The assignments were supported by COSY, DQFCOSY, TOCSY, and NOE correlations with nucleotide protons. The chemical shifts of the HNE protons are summarized in Table 3. As compared with those at pH 5.5, the resonances of the HNE protons were shifted upfield. NOE cross-peaks were assigned to HNE protons (Table 3). HNE protons were found to exhibit NOE interactions with minor groove protons, including A8 H2, A18 H2, and A18 H1. Deoxyribose and Backbone Angle Conformations. Deoxyribose and backbone angle conformations were determined spectroscopically from DQF-COSY and 31P-H3 HMBC correlations. Evaluation of the DQF-COSY spectrum revealed that the pseudorotation of the sugar rings of all nucleotides except X7 and A18 was either C1-exo or C2-endo. The T17 phosphate resonance shifted downfield. Structural Refinement. A total of 467 distance restraints, including 251 intraresidue and 216 interresidue restraints, were calculated from the intensities of NOE cross-peaks by MARDIGRAS. In addition, 44 empirical distance restraints defining Watson-Crick base pairing were used to refine the structure of the duplex; their use was predicated upon inspection of the NMR data, which indicated that Watson-Crick base pairing was intact throughout the duplex except for the X7·A18 and A8·T17 base pairs. Finally, an additional 160 empirical backbone torsion angle restraints were also used for structure refinement; these were based upon inspection of the NMR data, which suggested that the adducted duplex maintained the B type architecture. Hydrogen bonding and torsion angle restraints were not used for the X7·A18 and A8·T17 base pairs (Table 2). The randomly seeded rMD calculations were performed starting with initial structures, which were created either with A or B form geometries. Pairwise rmsd analysis of emergent structures indicated that the calculations converged, irrespective of starting structure (Table 2). The accuracies of the emergent structures

no hydrogen bond was formed between these nucleotides. The aliphatic HNE chain was oriented toward the minor groove.

Discussion
(6S,8R,11S) 1,N -HNE-dGuo Adduct Does Not Undergo Ring Opening When Placed Opposite dAdo in Duplex DNA. The ring-closed (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dG adduct in duplex DNA opposite a mismatched dA contrasts with the situation when the same adduct is placed opposite the correct complementary nucleotide dCyd in this sequence. In the latter instance, the exocyclic ring of the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dG adduct undergoes ring opening and exists primarily as a diastereomeric set of minor groove cyclic hemiacetals (36). The conclusion that the (6S,8R,11S) exocyclic 1,N2-dGuo adduct does not undergo ring opening when placed opposite dA derives, in part, from the failure to observe the X7 N9H imino resonance in acidic, neutral, or basic solutions (Figure 5). The alternative possibility that ring opening had occurred but that the resulting X7 N9H imino resonance was in rapid exchange with solvent, and hence was not observed, was considered. However, no spectroscopic evidence for a ring-opened aldehydic proton is observed, under acidic, neutral, or basic solution conditions. An aldehydic 1H resonance was observed when this adduct was placed opposite the correct complementary nucleotide dCyd nucleotide in this sequence, even though it existed primarily as a diastereomeric set of minor groove cyclic hemiacetals (36). Moreover, the data of the present case suggest that the bulky ring-closed (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct rotates about the glycosyl bond, into the syn conformation under acidic conditions; this is supported by the observation of NOEs with major groove protons, which would not be anticipated if ring opening of the bulky lesion to the corresponding minor groove cyclic hemiacetal forms were present (36). Additionally, the chemical shifts of X7 H6-H8 and H11 are similar to those observed for the exocyclic 1,N2-dGuo nucleotide (35) (Table

were evaluated by comparison of theoretical NOE intensities calculated by complete relaxation analysis for the refined structure, to the experimental NOE intensities, to yield sixth root residuals (R1x). This residual was less than 0.1 for the modified duplex (Table 2), indicating that the refined structures provided an accurate depiction of the data. Analysis of the rMD Structure. The backbone torsion angles of the refined structures showed that the oligodeoxynucleotide remained in the B type geometry except at the adduct region. Expanded views of the average structure around the adduct region are shown in Figure 7C,D, and the base stacking around the modified region is shown in Figure 8C,D. All nucleosides including X7 maintained the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond. However, the duplex was highly perturbed. X7 was intercalated into the duplex, and the complementary A18 was displaced in the 5-direction. No hydrogen bond was observed between them. The neighboring C6·G19 base pair maintained Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding with minimal distortion. The A8·T17 base pair was also highly perturbed, and

4) but differ from the chemical shifts of X7 H6-H8 and H11 when the adduct exists as diastereomeric N2-dGuo cyclic hemiacetals when placed complementary to dCyd in duplex DNA (36). The observation that the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct maintains the ring-closed structure in DNA when mismatched with dAdo is also consistent with the notion that placement of enal-derived 1,N2-hydroxypropano-dGuo adducts opposite dCyd in duplex DNA facilitates the ring-opening reaction to aldehydic products. Riggins et al. (37, 38) reported mechanistic studies of the ring opening and closing of the related malondialdehydederived adduct 3-(2-deoxy- -D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2-R]purin-10(3H)-one (M1dG). They concluded that ring opening of M1dG as a nucleoside or in oligodeoxynucleotides occurs via a reversible second-order reaction with hydroxide and is catalyzed by the complementary dCyd in duplex DNA. The closure of the resulting N2-(3-oxo-1-propenyl)-dGuo anion is pH-dependent, and under neutral and acidic conditions, ring closure is biphasic, leading to the rapid formation of intermediates that slowly convert to M1dG in a general acid-catalyzed reaction, in the presence of dCyd in the complementary strand. It should be noted that the ring-opened N2-(3-oxo-1-propenyl)dGuo adduct has a perturbed pKa (6.9) relative to the extended conjugation offered by the N2-(3-oxo-1-propenyl) group, which is likely to play a significant role in the mechanism of ring opening and closing (90). The enal-dGuo adducts are saturated and more likely to have a pKa similar to dGuo. Structure of the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo Adduct Mismatched with dAdo. Acidic Solution. The (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct maintains a ring-closed form and rotates about the glycosyl bond into the syn conformation with a predicted torsion angle at X7 of 106° when mismatched with dAdo at low pH. The strong X7 H2fX7 H1 NOE correlation, the downfield chemical shift of the X7 H2 resonance (91-94), the upfield chemical shift of X7 H2 as compared to other guanine H8 resonances, and the observation of X7 H2fA8 H2 and X7 H2fA18 H2 NOEs are each consistent with this conclusion. The downfield chemical shifts of A18 N2H, and A18 H8 as compared with the other adenines are consistent with the conclusion that A18 is protonated (76, 89, 95, 96). Similar to the 1,N2-propano-2-deoxyguanosine (PdG)·dAdo base pair (76), the anticipated far downfield resonance of the protonated A18 N1H is not observed, suggesting that A18 N1H undergoes rapid exchange with solvent and is probably only weakly hydrogen bonded (Figure 8A,B). The presence of the X7 syn conformation and A18 protonation facilitates base pairing through X7 O10fA18 N6H and X7 N1fA18 N1H hydrogen bonds (note that X7 N1 corresponds to N7 of unmodified Gua and X7 O10 corresponds to O6 of unmodified Gua) (Chart 1). The syn conformation of the glycosyl torsion angle places the HNE moiety in the major groove (Figure 7A,B), consistent with the NOE correlations with major groove protons, notably C6 H5 and C6 H6 (Table 1). The 5-neighbor C6·G19 and 3-neighbor A8·T17 base pairs maintain Watson-Crick base pairing but are distorted (Figure 7A,B). This

conclusion is supported by the observation that the T17 and G19 imino resonances broaden more rapidly as compared to the other imino resonances (Figure 2A). Basic Solution. In basic solution, all nucleotides including X7 adopt the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond. Thus, the HNE moiety is oriented toward the minor groove (Figure 7C,D). The presence of the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond at X7 disrupts Watson­Crick hydrogen bonding at the adducted base pair (Figure 8C,D) and greatly perturbs the DNA duplex at the lesion site. The rMD calculations predict that the complementary A18 is displaced in the 5-direction, resulting in a bulge at the X7·A18 base pair. The presence of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding at the 5-neighboring C6·G19 base pair is supported by the observation of the G19 imino resonance and NOEs between the G19 imino proton and the exocyclic amino protons of C6 (Figure 5B). However, these disappear at lower temperatures as compared to other imino resonances (Figure 2B) consistent with the prediction from the rMD calculations that base pair C6·G19 is distorted (Figure 8C). In the 3-direction, the broad T17 imino resonance (Figure 2B) and lack of NOEs to the A8 N6H and A8 H2 resonances lead to the conclusion that base pair A8·T17 is also significantly disrupted (Figure 8D). The downfield shift of the associated 31P resonance suggests that that the phosphodiester backbone is distorted at the lesion site. Conformational Equilibrium of the Mismatched Duplex in Neutral Solution. At pH 7.3, both the syn and the anti conformations of X7 about the glycosyl bond are populated. This conclusion is supported by the observation that two sets of 1H NMR resonances, matching those in acidic and basic solutions, respectively, are obtained at pH 7.3. Exchange NOE cross-peaks are observed for X7 H2, A8 H2, T17 H6, A18 H2, A18 H8, and G19 H8, indicating a slow exchange between the acidic and the basic conformations of the HNE adduct, on the NMR time scale (Chart 2) (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The steric bulk of the HNE aliphatic chain presumably slows the conformational exchange rate. At pH 7.3, the set of resonances corresponding to those observed in basic solution is stronger than are those observed in acidic solution, suggesting the major conformer, which constitutes 60-70% of the overall conformations based on the integration of the 1H resonances, is that in which X7 adopts the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond. This is also supported by the similarity of COSY spectra at pH 7.3 and pH 8.9. The pKa of adenosine is 7.6 (97); therefore, A18 is largely protonated at pH 5.5, X7 adopts the syn conformation about the glycosyl bond to form hydrogen bonds with A18; A18 is weakly protonated at pH 7.3, and the anti conformation of the glycosyl bond is the major species present; A18 is not protonated at pH 8.9, and the anti conformation of the glycosyl bond predominates.

when placed opposite dAdo in duplex DNA suggests that it does not undergo further chemistry. In contrast, when placed complementary to dCyd in this 5-CpG-3 sequence, the (6S,8R,11S) adduct slowly forms an interstrand cross-link (35). The slow rate of interstrand cross-link formation is attributed to the fact that the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct exists primarily as a set of diastereomeric cyclic hemiacetals when placed into this duplex (36); these cyclic hemiacetals mask the aldehyde necessary for cross-link formation. In contrast, the corresponding 1,N2-dGuo adducts of acrolein (98, 99) and crotonaldehyde (99, 100), which exist predominantly as aldehydes and do not rearrange to cyclic hemiacetals, form interchain cross-links more rapidly when paired opposite dCyd in this sequence context (99, 101, 102). In the case of the crotonaldehyde adduct, the 6R stereoisomer forms cross-links more efficiently than does the 6S stereoisomer (102, 103). This is attributed to the relative orientations of the reactive aldehyde species within the minor groove for the two diasteromeric adducts, such that interstrand crosslinking is favored for the 6R stereoisomer (100). Significantly, the (6S,8R,11S) diastereomeric adduct derived from HNE possesses the same relative stereochemistry as does the 6R crotonaldehyde adduct and, likewise, favorably orients the reactive aldehyde species to facilitate interstrand cross-link formation (104). Biological Implications. The low levels of mutations induced by the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct when present in duplex DNA opposite cytosine are likely related to the observation that it undergoes ring opening to expose the Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonding face of the adducted dGuo (58), which facilitates the correct incorporation of dCTP opposite the lesion during lesion bypass. A similar explanation has been advanced to explain the low levels of mutations induced by the acrolein (105, 106) and crotonaldehydederived exocyclic 1,N2-dGuo adducts (107). Wolfle et al. (61) reported that the sequential activity of pols  and  bypassed the (6S,8R,11S) and (6R,8S,11R) 1,N2-HNE-dG adducts. Significantly, pol  correctly inserted dCTP and to a lesser extent dTTP opposite the HNE adduct. Further extension was achieved in the presence of pol , which elongated from a Cyt opposite the HNE adducts much more efficiently than when Thy was opposite the adducts (61). The source of the GfT transversions induced by the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dG adduct in this sequence remains obscure. Xing et al. (26) attributed the low levels of GfT transversions to the reorientation of the adduct into the syn conformation about the glycosyl bond, thus allowing misincorporation of dATP opposite the lesion. This might allow for subsequent extension from the mismatched template primer, for example, by polymerase , which efficiently extends from primer-terminal base pairs containing mismatches or lesions (108). The present structural data confirm that such a reorienta-

tion about the glycosyl bond does occur when the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dG adduct is mismatched with dAdo in duplex DNA and that the syn conformation of the adduct is present in equilibrium with the anti conformation at physiological pH values. Xing et al. (26) subsequently invoked the transient presence of the rare imine tautomer of dATP during trans-lesion bypass as a potential source of the GfT transversions. In contrast, the present results suggest that a pH-mediated transient protonation of the N1 imine of dAdo occurs in duplex DNA. The (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct also induces GfA transitions in the human p53 gene (55, 57) and in the sequence used in the present study (58). Thus, the extent to which the 1,N2-HNE-dGuo·Thy mismatched sequence perturbs the DNA duplex will also be of interest. The (6S,8R,11S) HNE-induced adduct is anticipated to also maintain the exocyclic 1,N2-dGuo structure when mismatched with Thy in the complementary strand. The saturated PdG adduct, which is stable in the exocyclic 1,N2dGuo configuration, provides a surrogate for the chemically unstable enal-derived exocyclic 1,N2-dGuo adducts (76, 89, 95, 109115). The conformation of PdG in either PdG·dCyd (89, 95) or PdG·dAdo (76, 109, 111, 112) base pairs is also pH-dependent. PdG adopts the syn conformation about the glycosyl bond with complementary dCyd or dAdo in acidic solution, whereas it adopts the anti conformation without hydrogen bonds with the opposite base in basic solution. At neutral pH or a pKa value of 7.6, the two conformations exist in equilibrium. Plum et al. (116) showed that the PdG lesion alters the differential thermal stability (Tm) but not the differential thermodynamic stability (G) of duplexes with correctly paired dCyd or mismatched dAdo cross-strand partners. This has led to the suggestion that the observed preference for insertion of dATP over dCTP across from the PdG lesion should not be rationalized in terms of thermodynamic differences between the final duplex states and probably instead reflects properties of the DNA polymerase and the replication fork. Likewise, the present data indicate that the Tm for the X7·A18 base pair in either basic or acidic solution is lower than is the Tm for the X7·C18 base pair. In light of these findings, the structure of the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNEdGuo adduct, particularly in complexes with the bypass polymerases  and  (61), will be of interest. A similar pH-dependent syn/anti conformational exchange has also been observed for the 1,N2-ethenodGuo (1,N2dG)·dCyd (117-119) base pair. Similar to the PdG adduct, and differing from the (6S,8R,11S) 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct, 1,N2- dGuo is stable in the exocyclic ring-closed configuration. Under basic conditions, both 1,N2- dGuo and the complementary dCyd adopted the anti conformation about the glycosyl bonds (117, 118). In contrast, under acidic conditions, the 1,N2dGuo adduct formed a Hoogsteen pair with the complementary cytosine, characterized by downfield shifts of the amino protons of the cytosine complementary to the exocyclic adduct (119).

Summary
The 1,N2-HNE-dGuo adduct with the (6S,8R,11S) configuration maintains the exocyclic 1,N2-dGuo structure when mismatched with dAdo in this duplex. It undergoes syn/anti conformational equilibrium with the anti conformation being the major species in neutral solution. The syn conformation favors base pairing with the complementary protonated A18 in acidic solution. In basic solution, X7 adopts the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond without hydrogen bonding with A18. The X7·A18 mismatch greatly perturbs the neighboring C6·G19 and A8·T17 base pairs in both acidic and basic solutions. Deposition of Structural Data. The PDB files for the mismatched oligodeoxynucleotide duplex structure at pH 5.5 and pH 8.9 are ZKAR and ZKAS, respectively. Acknowledgment.
