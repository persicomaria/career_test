SUMMARY

The MVB pathway plays essential roles in several eukaryotic cellular processes. Proper function of the MVB pathway requires reversible membrane association of the ESCRTs, a process catalyzed by Vps4 ATPase. Vta1 regulates the Vps4 activity, but its mechanism of action was poorly understood. We report the high-resolution crystal structures of the Did2- and Vps60-binding N-terminal domain and the Vps4-binding C-terminal domain of S. cerevisiae Vta1. The C-terminal domain also mediates Vta1 dimerization and both subunits are required for its function as a Vps4 regulator. Emerging from our analysis is a mechanism of regulation by Vta1 in which the C-terminal domain stabilizes the ATP-dependent double ring assembly of Vps4. In addition, the MIT motif-containing N-terminal domain, projected by a long disordered linker, allows contact between the Vps4 disassembly machinery and the accessory ESCRT-III proteins. This provides an additional level of regulation and coordination for ESCRT-III assembly and disassembly.
INTRODUCTION The multivesicular body (MVB) is a special form of the late endosome, generated when the limiting membrane of the endosome invaginates and buds into its own lumen. During this process, proteins residing in the endosomal membrane are sorted into the forming vesicles. Subsequent fusion of MVBs with the lysosome results in the delivery of cargo-containing intralumenal vesicles to the hydrolytic environment of the lysosome (for reviews see Babst, 2005; Gruenberg and Stenmark, 2004; Katzmann et al., 2002; Piper and Katzmann, 2007). The MVB pathway plays key roles in eukaryotic cellular processes such as cell surface growth factor receptor downregulation (for reviews see Katzmann et al., 2002; Piper and Katzmann, 2007), budding of retroviruses from the host cell (for a review see Morita and Sundquist, 2004), and cytokinesis (Carlton and MartinSerrano, 2007; Morita et al., 2007). Entry into the MVB pathway is a tightly regulated process and depends on the action of class E Vps (vacuolar protein sorting) proteins, a majority of which are subunits of three distinct protein complexes, called endosomal

sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-I, -II, and -III, for reviews see Hurley and Emr, 2006; Katzmann et al., 2002; Piper and Katzmann, 2007; Williams and Urbe, 2007). These complexes transiently assemble on the endosomal membrane during the cargo sorting process. For sustained protein trafficking through the MVB pathway, the ESCRTs need to be dissociated and disassembled from the membrane and recycled back into the cytoplasm. Vps4, together with its regulator Vta1, catalyzes the process of ESCRT disassembly in an ATP-dependent reaction (Babst et al., 1997). Vps4 is a member of the AAA-protein (ATPase associated with a variety of activities) family (Frickey and Lupas, 2004; Vale, 2000). It cycles between alternate molecular assembly states in vitro depending on the state of ATP binding and hydrolysis (Babst et al., 1998). The protein exists as a 90 kDa molecular species that upon ATP binding oligomerizes into a large molecular complex of 440 kDa, which also has a higher affinity for the substrate ESCRT-III subunits (Xiao et al., 2007). ATP hydrolysis by Vps4 in turn results in the disassembly of the oligomer, coincident with the release of the ESCRTs from the endosomal membrane. Since ATP hydrolysis represents an irreversible step in the MVB pathway, regulation of the Vps4 ATPase activity is critical for the proper function of the MVB sorting reaction. Vta1 has been recently shown to act as a positive regulator of Vps4 by stimulating its ATPase activity (Azmi et al., 2006; Lottridge et al., 2006). Furthermore, this mechanism of regulation appears to be conserved during evolution, since Vta1 orthologs have been identified from yeast to humans and contain highly homologous sequence motifs that are thought to mediate interactions with Vps4 (Fujita et al., 2004; Haas et al., 2007; Yeo et al., 2003). In addition, Vta1 also interacts with other proteins acting in the late stage of the MVB pathway, such as the accessory ESCRT-III proteins Vps60 and Vps46/Did2 (Azmi et al., 2006; Lottridge et al., 2006; Shiflett et al., 2004). These interactions are also important for the MVB sorting and the retrovirus release processes (Ward et al., 2005). However, the structural basis for the function of Vta1 remains elusive. Here we report biochemical and high-resolution structural characterization of S. cerevisiae Vta1. We show that Vta1 has a modular structure with two well-folded terminal domains bridged by a region dominated by random-coil structure. Crystal structures of the Vps60- and Did2-binding N-terminal domain and the Vps4-binding C-terminal domain reveal the structural details for the respective binding sites. The C-terminal domain also mediates Vta1 dimerization, and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that both subunits in the dimer are necessary for the

function of Vta1 as a Vps4 regulator. Our study suggests a mechanism of regulation by Vta1 in which the C-terminal domain promotes the ATP-dependent double ring assembly of Vps4, while the N-terminal domain, projected by the disordered middle linker region, allows contact between the Vps4 disassembly machinery and accessory ESCRT-III proteins to coordinate ESCRT-III assembly and disassembly. RESULTS Structure Determination Our initial attempt to crystallize the intact S. cerevisiae Vta1 was not successful. Limited proteolysis of Vta1 by chymotrypsin cleaved the protein after Tyr279 and resulted in two major fragments, of which the C-terminal fragment Vta1280­330 was readily crystallized. Secondary structure prediction for Vta1 suggested that the region between residues 168 and 279 contains little regular structure. Therefore, an N-terminal fragment Vta11­167 was generated and crystals were subsequently obtained. In the following sections, we will refer Vta11­167 as Vta1NTD and Vta1280­330 as Vta1CTD. The structure of Vta1NTD was determined by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) from a native crystal and a selenomethionyl crystal. The protein structure was refined against the native data to a working R factor of ° 21.5% and a free R factor of 26.0% at 2.9 A (Table 1). The entire structure can be visualized except for residues 65­75, which are presumed disordered. There are two polypeptide chains, related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry, in the asymmetric unit. However, gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation experiments suggested that Vta1NTD is a monomer in solution. The structure of Vta1CTD was determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) from

° a selenomethionyl crystal at 1.8 A and later refined against a native data set to a working R factor of 22.0% and a free R factor ° of 24.9% at 1.5 A (Table 1). There are a total of six polypeptide chains that form three dimer pairs in the asymmetric unit. While the C termini of the six molecules are all well defined, the N termini show great structural variability among the six molecules and the region between residues 280 and 289 must be modeled into several alternative positions. The Crystal Structure of Vta1NTD Vta1NTD contains seven a helices (a1­a7) arranged into two antiparallel three-helix bundle modules (Figure 1A). Helices a1 (1­18), a2 (22­36), and a3 (42­64) form the first module, and helices a5 (86­110), a6 (115­135), and a7 (141­163) form the second module. A short helix a4 (76­84) and a disordered loop between a3 and a4 connect a3 and a5 at one end of the molecule. The two modules have an overall very similar structure and are related by a pseudodyad with a1/a5, a2/a6, and a3/a7 forming the corresponding pairs. They stack together via a1-a2 and a5-a6 with their helical axes perpendicular to each other. Extensive hydrophobic interactions exist between module 1, a4, ° and module 2 such that a total of 1809 A2 is buried at the interface of the three structural elements. Therefore the entire assembly should be considered as a single domain. This explains the fact that attempts to express the two modules separately lead to either no or aggregated protein expression (data not shown). Vta1NTD Consists of Two MIT Motifs When the two structural modules within Vta1NTD were used to search for proteins of similar structure in the protein database, the N-terminal ESCRT-III binding domains of Vps4 were among the best matches (PDB ID: 1YXR and 2CPT, for human Vps4A and Vps4B, respectively). This domain contains a fold of three

helices also known as the microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) motif (Scott et al., 2005b; Takasu et al., 2005). When the three MIT domain helices of Vps4 were aligned with those in the two modules of Vta1NTD (MIT1 and MIT2), root mean square ° ° deviations for the Ca atoms are 1.3 A and 1.7 A over 52 and 54 residues, respectively, for human Vps4A (Figures 1B and 1C). The MIT domain of Vps4 mediates its interaction with the ESCRT-III subunits. The site of interaction involves a surface groove formed by helix 2 and helix 3 of the MIT domain (Scott

et al., 2005b; Obita et al., 2007; Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007). The ESCRT-III subunits interact with Vps4 by providing a fourth helix to complete a noncanonical tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) fold. Although Vta1 does not bind to the ESCRT-III subunits, it does interact with two ESCRT-III-like proteins, Vps60 and Vps46/Did2 (Lottridge et al., 2006; Shiflett et al., 2004). Given the structural similarity between Vta1NTD and Vps4 MIT domain, it is likely that Vta1 interacts with Vps60 and Vps46/Did2 via Vta1NTD in a manner similar to that between Vps4 and

ESCRT-III. Indeed, purified Vta1NTD alone is sufficient to bind to GST-Vps60 and GST-Did2, while purified Vta1 lacking the NTD fails to bind to either (Figure 1D). This in vitro result is also consistent with an earlier finding that deletion of the N-terminal 68 residues of Vta1 abolishes its in vivo interaction with Vps60 (Azmi et al., 2006). Potential Vps60 and Did2 Binding Surface on Vta1NTD Since the site of protein-protein interaction in the Vps4 MIT domain involves a surface groove formed by helix 2 and helix 3 of the motif, we examined the two corresponding surface areas in Vta1NTD. Both surfaces contain a hydrophobic center surrounded by polar/charged regions. Surface 1 in MIT1 is formed by conserved hydrophobic residues Leu-29, Val-32, Leu-36, Leu-53, and Ile-56, and conserved charged/polar residues Glu-33, Arg-41, Thr-46, Thr-50, Asp-54, Glu-57, Lys-60, and Lys-61 (Figures 2A and 2B). In fact, this region on MIT1 represents the largest conserved area on the surface of Vta1NTD. The corresponding residues for Leu-29, Val-32, Leu-36, Leu-53, Ile-56, Glu-33, Thr-46, Asp-54, Glu-57, and Lys-60 in the Vps4 MIT domain (Try-34, Leu-37, Met-41, Leu-64, Ala-67, Asp-38, Arg-57, Asn-65, Glu-68, and Lys-71) were shown to be involved in its interaction with the ESCRT-III subunit Vps2 (Obita et al., 2007; Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007). Compared with surface 1, surface 2 on MIT2 is much less conserved (Figures 2A and 2C). Residues that form the surface include hydrophobic residues Trp-122, Ile125, Leu-132, and Ile151, and charged/polar residues Lys-118, Ser-129, His-133, Lys-136, Glu-137, Glu-141, Thr-144, Gln148, Lys-152, and Lys155. Of these, only Trp-122, Leu-132, Glu-137, Glu-141, and Lys-152 appear to be conserved in other Vta1 proteins. In the lattice of Vta1NTD crystals, each Vta1NTD noncrystallographic ``dimer'' interacts with four neighboring molecules. Three of these interactions involve a helix from a neighboring molecule binding to the potential Vps60 binding surface in either MIT1 or MIT2 (Figure 2D). In all three cases, a majority of the abovedescribed conserved residues are buried at the interface. These findings suggest that surface grooves formed by helix 2 and helix 3 of the MIT motifs in Vta1NTD are capable of participating in protein-protein interactions and therefore are excellent candidates for binding to Vps60 and Vps46/Did2. To address this possibility, mutational analysis of the putative Vps60 and Did2 binding surface(s) of Vta1 was performed. Conserved surface residues within MIT1 (Leu-29, Leu-36, Leu-53, Ile56, Glu-57) and MIT2 (Trp-122, Leu-132, Glu-137, Lys-149, Lys152) were mutated to alanines, the mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria, and the purified proteins were examined for binding to GST-Did2 and GST-Vps60. While most mutations did not dramatically reduce binding (data not shown), this analysis identified 2 residues, Trp-122 and Lys-152, as important for

Vta1 interaction with both Did2 and Vps60 (Figure 2E). This result implicated the surface groove formed by helix 2 (a6) and helix 3 (a7) of MIT2 as the putative binding site for both Vps60 and Did2. Functional analysis of this interaction is presented in the accompanying study in this issue of Developmental Cell (Azmi et al., 2008). The Crystal Structure of Vta1CTD Vta1CTD is organized into a pair of antiparallel a helices (a8-a9) (Figure 3A). Helix a8 (281­310) is significantly longer than helix a9 (312­330) such that interhelical interactions only exist between a9 and the C-terminal half of a8. As will be discussed in more detail, the structure where interhelical interaction occurs is also involved in protein dimerization. Therefore, it should be considered as the structural core of Vta1CTD. Interestingly, regions outside the core display great conformational variability. Of the six independently determined Vta1CTD molecules in the asymmetric unit, helix a8 displays different degrees of bending at Arg-290, ranging from À30 to 14 (Figure 3B). These results suggest that the N-terminal part of helix a8 is highly flexible relative to the core of Vta1CTD. Oligomerization State of Vta1 The crystal structure of Vta1CTD shows that the molecule forms a dimeric structure in the crystal lattice where three independent dimer pairs were observed. This is consistent with previous findings that Vta1 is molecular dimer in solution and the C-terminal region is required for dimerization (Azmi et al., 2006). To determine whether Vta1CTD alone is sufficient for dimerization, the oligomerization state of Vta1CTD was analyzed using sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (Figure 3C). The results showed that, like Vta1, Vta1CTD is a dimer in solution. In contrast, only a monomer species was observed for Vta1 lacking the C-terminal domain (Vta11­279), consistent with results from previous studies using an in vivo assay (Azmi et al., 2006). Therefore, Vta1CTD is necessary and sufficient for protein dimerization. In forming the dimer, the antiparallel a helices within each Vta1CTD subunit interact with their helical axes aligned to create a four-helix bundle dimer structure (Figure 3D). In the four-helix bundle, symmetry-related helices are packed against each other and the molecular dyad is perpendicular to the helical axes. As a result, the N-terminal ends of the two subunits point away from the four-helix bundle and in opposite directions. The dimer interface covers 21% of the solvent accessible surface for each subunit. The interface is predominantly hydrophobic with many highly conserved residues involved, including Ala-304, Leu308, Leu-313, Ala-316, Leu-320, Leu-324, and Leu-327. At the periphery of the interface, a few polar interactions are also

observed including a pair of salt bridges between Arg-290 and a highly conserved Glu-311. To assess the contribution of the conserved residues at the Vta1CTD dimer interface to the stability of Vta1 dimer structure, two single point mutants, L320E and L327E, were generated. Both residues are in the central region of the hydrophobic dimer interface, and we predicted that substitution of them with charged glutamic acids would disrupt the packing within the

dimer structure. Mutant proteins were purified and their oligomerization states were analyzed using gel-filtration chromatography. Indeed, compared with the wild-type Vta1 dimer, the elution profile of the L320E and L327E mutants were shifted toward the monomer species on gel filtration (Figure 3E). These biochemical results confirmed that the conserved interface observed in Vta1CTD structure is responsible for Vta1 dimerization.

Vta1 heterodimers were coexpressed in pETDuet-1 vector such that the N-terminal His-tagged wild-type protein is in the first expression cassette and the C-terminal S-tagged wild-type or mutant protein is in the second expression cassette. Heterodimer proteins were isolated by tandem purification with Ni2+-NTA resin and S-protein resin (left panel). Heterodimers retained on the S-protein resin were then used to pull down Vps4E233Q in the presence of 2 mM ATP. Bound Vps4 proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting with anti-Vps4 antibody (right panel). Figure 4C was prepared with Pymol (DeLano Scientific LLC).

Vps4 Binding Surface on Vta1CTD The C-terminal region of Vta1 has been previously shown to interact with Vps4 (Azmi et al., 2006). With purified Vps4E233Q (an ATPase deficient mutant), we further demonstrated that Vta1 interacts with Vps4 in an adenine-nucleotide-dependent manner (Figure 4A). Interestingly, the N-terminal region of Vta1 appears to have an effect on this interaction as Vta1CTD displays a stronger ADP-dependent binding to Vps4.

Sequence alignment of Vta1 proteins revealed a high degree of overall conservation for Vta1CTD among representative members from yeast, plants, and mammals (Figure 4B). Many of the conserved residues are located at the dimer interface and are important for supporting the dimer structure. There are, however, a few conserved surface-exposed residues including Lys-299, Lys-302, Tyr-303, Ser-306, Tyr-310, Glu-311, Asp312, Thr-315, and Lys-322 (Figure 4C). Previous studies showed

that mutations in Lys-299 and Lys-302 completely abolished the ability of Vta1 to stimulate the ATPase activity of Vps4 while mutation in Lys-322 had no effect (Azmi et al., 2006). Since Lys-299 and Lys-302 are located on helix a8 and Lys-322 is located on helix a9, these results suggest that a8 is the site of Vps4 binding. Four more conserved residues on a8 and the short linker between a8 and a9, residues Tyr-303, Tyr-310, Glu-311, and Asp312, were mutated into alanines to assess their roles in mediating Vps4 interaction. Of the four, Y303A and Y310A were deficient in interaction with Vps4 as demonstrated in a GST pull-down assay while maintaining their dimeric structures (Figures 4D and 3E). In addition, when the mutant proteins were purified and used in the ATPase assay, they failed to stimulate the ATPase activity of Vps4, in contrast to the wild-type protein (Figure 4E). Therefore, it is likely that these two residues are directly involved in Vps4 interaction as well. The other two mutants, E311A and D312A, also did not bind to Vps4 but they were monomers in solution (data not shown). Hence it is not clear whether they directly participate in binding to the ATPase. Taken together, these results showed that the site of Vps4 binding on Vta1 is located on the solventexposed side of helix a8 and the binding characteristic appears to be largely hydrophilic in nature. The Dimer Structure of Vta1 Is Required for Vps4 Interaction The fact that monomer mutants E311A and D312A failed to interact with Vps4 prompted us to examine the role of Vta1 dimer in regulating the function of Vps4. Indeed, the monomer mutants L320E and L327E also failed either to pull down Vps4 in our GST pull-down assay or to stimulate the ATPase activity of Vps4, suggesting that a stable association between Vta1 and Vps4 requires the presence of both Vps4 binding sites on Vta1 (Figures 4D and 4E). To further characterize this structural requirement, His-tagged wild-type Vta1 was coexpressed with S-tagged wild-type Vta1, Y303A, or Y310A mutants in E. coli. Vta1 heterodimers were isolated by tandem purification with Ni2+-NTA resin and S-protein resin (Figure 4F). Heterodimers retained on the S-protein resin were then used to pull down Vps4E233Q in the presence of ATP. Although these heterodimers

behaved similarly during the process of expression and purification, only the wild-type Vta1 heterodimer could interact with Vps4. Neither WT/Y303A nor WT/Y310A heterodimer, which contains one of the two functional Vps4 binding sites, could form a stable complex with Vps4E233Q. These results strongly suggested that both Vps4 binding sites on the Vta1 dimer are necessary for its stable association with Vps4. To further determine the role of Vta1 dimerization and Vps4 binding on the function of Vta1 in the MVB pathway, we examined the sorting of carboxypeptidase S (CPS) in yeast cells expressing wild-type VTA1 versus mutant vta1 alleles. Sorting of the MVB cargo GFP-CPS was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy in vta1D cells transformed with mutant forms of vta1 Figure 5). Four mutants were used in the study: two Vps4-binding deficient mutants Y303A and Y310A and two dimerizationdeficient mutants L320E and L327E. Cells transformed with empty plasmid display a dramatic mislocalization of GFP-CPS to the limiting membrane of the vacuole, indicative of the MVB sorting defect observed in vta1D cells. As expected, transformation with wild-type VTA1 restores delivery of GFP-CPS into the MVB pathway as indicated by fluorescence within the vacuole lumen. However, none of the mutants is capable of complementing the MVB sorting defect observed in vta1D cells. GFP-CPS was mislocalized in cells expressing these mutants as in vta1D cells. These results highlight the importance of both Vta1 dimerization and Vps4 binding for the in vivo function of Vta1. The Structure of Intact Vta1 The region between Vta1NTD and Vta1CTD (residues 168­279) was not defined crystallographically in the current study. Although this linker is present in all Vta1 proteins, there appears to be no strong sequence conservation. In addition, the length of the linker varies greatly among different Vta1 orthologs. While structure prediction for the linker suggests that it contains little regular ordered secondary structure, we sought to confirm the prediction experimentally by measuring the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum in the far UV region for the linker. Since the linker alone cannot be expressed, we obtained its spectrum indirectly by measuring the spectra for the intact and various truncation

forms of Vta1. The CD spectrum of the intact Vta1 is dominated by contributions from a helices (Figure 6A). The CD spectrum of the intact protein is nearly superimposable to a linear combination of the spectra of Vta11­279 and Vta1CTD suggesting that these isolated fragments retain their native structures as in the intact protein (Figure 6B). The CD spectrum for the linker can be obtained by subtracting the spectrum of Vta1NTD from that of Vta11­279, or, alternatively, by subtracting the spectra of Vta1NTD and Vta1CTD from that of the intact protein. These two calculated CD spectra agree with each other very well and both have a strong minimum near 195 nm (Figure 6C). This fea-

ture is typical for random coil structures, suggesting that the linker region is mostly devoid of ordered secondary structure and likely adopts a random coil conformation. Based on the structural information from the crystallographic and CD spectral analysis, we propose that the structure of intact Vta1 likely adopts an extremely elongated shape with Vta1CTD at the center and Vta1NTD pointing to the opposite ends, connected by the largely unstructured middle linker (Figure 6D). The Stokes radii of Vta1, Vta1CTD, and Vta1NTD are 5.9nm, 2.2nm, and 1.9nm, respectively, as determined by dynamic light scattering. These numbers are consistent either with the model

The Crystal Structure of Yeast Vta1

Figure 7. A Model of the Vps4-Vta1 Complex
Vps4 dodecameric ring structure (colored white) is modeled using coordinates of S. cerevisiae Vps4 ATPase domain (Xiao et al., 2007) based on its homology to p97 (1S3S) and FtsK (2IUU). ESCRT-III binding MIT domains (colored white, 1YXR) of Vps4 are placed above and below the double ring structure. One Vta1CTD dimer (colored blue and green) is modeled between the two Vta1-binding b-domains of Vps4 (one from each ring, colored red and orange) so that contacts between the known interacting structural elements from the two proteins are maximized. The long linker between Vta1CTD and Vta1NTD likely projects the Vta1NTD MIT domains outward, in the same general vicinity as the Vps4 MIT domains.

(Vta1) or with experimentally determined structures (Vta1NTD and Vta1CTD). Interestingly, the N-terminal portion of Vta1CTD can bend to different degrees depending on its environment, strongly suggesting that Vta1 is a highly flexible molecule with the Vps60 binding N-terminal domain acting like tentacles relative to its dimeric Vps4 binding core. DISCUSSION Vta1 functions in the MVB pathway by interacting with at least three other class E Vps proteins, Vps4, Vps60, and Vps46/Did2. Consistent with its biological function, the structure of Vta1 is organized into three distinct regions: an N-terminal Vps60- and Did2-binding domain, a random-coiled linker region, and a Cterminal Vps4 binding domain. In addition, the C-terminal domain also mediates protein homodimerization and the dimer structure is critical to its in vitro and in vivo function as a Vps4 regulator. The structure of Vta1 suggests a possible mechanism of interaction between Vta1 and Vps4. Vps4 contains a unique threestranded ``b domain'' structure that has been shown to mediate its interaction with Vta1 (Scott et al., 2005a). When Vps4 forms a high molecular weight ring-shaped oligomer, the b domain is situated at the periphery of the ring based on structural analogy to other AAA-ATPases whose oligomeric structures are known. Although it is still possible that the two symmetry-related Vps4 binding surfaces on Vta1CTD constitute a single Vps4 binding site, the discontinuous nature of the two surfaces would argue that they each bind to one Vps4 subunit. Given the symmetry within Vta1, the two Vps4 subunits they bind to must also obey the same matching 2-fold symmetry. This in turn suggests that the nucleotide-dependent Vps4 oligomer is a molecule with 2-fold symmetries, i.e., a double-ring structure. One could therefore envision a model where Vta1 promotes the nucleotide-dependent assembly of a double-ring structure of Vps4 by binding to one subunit of Vps4 from each ring (Figure 7). The activity of Vta1 would then lie in its ability to strengthen the inter-ring subunit interaction rather than the intra-ring subunit interaction, which is likely to be solely due to nucleotide binding. In fact, nucleotide-dependent oligomerization must precede the action of Vta1 as only very weak interaction is observed in the absence of nucleotide. On the other hand, while a stable Vps4 oligomer only exists in the presence of ATP, addition of Vta1 can stabilize the oligomeric structure even with ADP as the affinity between Vps4 and Vta1 increases significantly with the addition of ADP in our in vitro pull-down assay (Figure 4A). Assuming each ring of Vps4 oligomer consists of six subunits, simultaneous
46 Developmental Cell 14, 37­49, January 2008 ª2008 Elsevier Inc.

binding of six Vta1 molecules will significantly stabilize the structure of Vps4 oligomer. While the biological role of Vps4-Vta1 interaction is now clearly defined, we are less certain about the function of the interaction between Vta1 and accessory ESCRT-III proteins partly due to the lack of a well-defined biochemical role for these proteins. Like other class E Vps proteins, Vps60 and Vps46/Did2 are required for proper MVB sorting and have a structural organization similar to that of the ESCRT-III subunits (Williams and Urbe, 2007). In an accompanying study in this issue, Vta1 membrane recruitment is demonstrated to be dependent on Did2 while Vps60 membrane recruitment is dependent on Vta1 (Azmi et al., 2008). In addition, Vps60- and Did2-binding to Vta1 is demonstrated to enhance stimulation of Vps4 in vitro. These results suggest that interactions between Vta1 and the accessory ESCRT-III proteins direct membrane recruitment as well as stimulation of Vps4. Our structural analysis of Vta1NTD suggests that the overall mode of interaction between Vta1 and the accessory ESCRT-III proteins likely mimics that between Vps4 and the ESCRT-III subunits and differences may lie in the critical residues involved. It would be important to illustrate these structural features in future work. Although the middle linker region of Vta1 contains little ordered structure, it may nevertheless be functionally important. In a simple picture, the sizable linker can project the N-terminal region of Vta1 significantly beyond its dimeric C-terminal core, allowing Vta1NTD and its binding partner to interact with other proteins in the MVB pathway. For example, Vta1NTD might be close to the N-terminal domain of Vps4, thereby bringing the ESCRT-III and accessory ESCRT-III proteins together. Interestingly, we have noticed that the linker also appears to have certain effects on the affinities of Vta1 for Vps4 and the accessory ESCRT-III proteins. Both Vta1NTD and Vta1CTD show higher affinities for their respective binding partners than the full-length protein in our pull-down assays (data not shown and Figure 4A). These observations suggest that the linker may even function as a communicator between the two terminal domains more than just as a simple connector. In summary, we have determined the crystal structures of the two functionally important domains of Vta1 and showed that Vta1 is an elongated molecule with a Vps4-binding dimeric core in the middle and two Did2- and Vps60-binding domains pointing in opposite direction and connected to the core by long, flexible regions. The structural information, coupled with biochemical and cell biology experiments, has provided important insights to the molecular mechanism of Vta1 function. Emerging from

this study is a model where six Vta1 dimers bind to a double-ring shaped Vps4 near its midsection and twelve Did2- and Vps60binding domains project to both ends of the Vps4 double ring. In this picture, these MIT motif-containing domains will be close to the N-terminal ESCRT-III binding domain of Vps4 suggesting that the ESCRT-III-like proteins might be spatially close to the ESCRT-III proteins and participate in regulating the assembly and disassembly of the ESCRT-III complex. Therefore, we predict that Vta1 plays a much more complicated role in regulating the MVB pathway than previously envisioned.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning, Expression, and Purification DNA fragments encoding Vta1 and Vps4 were amplified from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA. Vta1NTD was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using a modified pET28b vector with a SUMO protein inserted between a His6-tag and the Vta1NTD coding region. The His6-SUMO-Vta1NTD protein was purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography following standard procedures. ULP1 protease was then added to remove the His6-SUMO tag, and the protein mixture was passed over a second Ni2+-NTA column. Vta1NTD was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Resource-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia). Vta1CTD was expressed in BL21(DE3) using a modified pET21a vector with an N-terminal His8-tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site. The His8-Vta1CTD was first purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. Overnight TEV protease digestion cleaved the N-terminal His8-tag, and a second Ni2+-NTA step removed the tag, uncleaved protein, and TEV protease. Vta1CTD was further purified using an anion exchange Source-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia). Selenomethionyl protein derivatives were expressed in E. coli B834(DE3) using a minimal medium where methionines were replaced with selenomethionines. Derivative proteins were purified in the same way as native proteins. Crystallization and Data Collection Native crystals of Vta1NTD were grown by the sitting drop method at 20 C. Proteins at 25 mg/ml were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a reservoir solution of 3.5 M sodium formate in a final volume of 4 ml and equilibrated against the reservoir solution. Crystals grew to full size in several days and were transferred into a solution containing 4 M sodium formate and 10% glucose before being flash-frozen under liquid nitrogen. Selenomethionyl protein crystals of Vta1NTD were grown from 3.6­3.8 M sodium formate, 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5) and harvested in the same way. Native and selenomethionyl crystals ° ° diffracted to 2.9 A and 3.0 A, respectively. Diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 21-ID. Native crystals of Vta1CTD were also grown by the sitting drop method at 20 C. Proteins at 20 mg/ml were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a reservoir solution of 30% MPD, 0.1 M Na-Acetate (pH 4.5), and 20 mM CaCl2 in a final volume of 4 ml and equilibrated against the reservoir solution. Crystals were transferred into the reservoir solution before being flash-frozen under liquid nitrogen. Selenomethionyl protein crystals of Vta1CTD were obtained in a similar way. Native and selenomethionyl ° ° crystals diffracted to 1.5 A and 1.8 A, respectively. Diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 23-ID. All data were integrated and scaled by using the program HKL2000 (HKL Research). Structure Determination and Refinement The structure of Vta1NTD was determined by the SIRAS method using a native data set and a data set collected at the peak wavelength of the selenium atom ° (l = 0.9787 A). Crystals belong to the I4 space group with a unit cell dimension ° ° of a = b = 126.17 A, c = 70.25 A. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Six of the twelve expected selenium sites were found and crossconfirmed with SnB (Weeks and Miller, 1999) and CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). Four additional sites were identified using anomalous difference Fourier method as implemented in SHARP (Vonrhein et al., 2006). Parameters for these ten sites were refined and SIRAS phases were calculated and improved by solvent flattening with SHARP. The resulting experimental map is of high quality to allow unambiguous tracing of the model. The model was built manually with O

(Jones et al., 1991) and refined against the native data with CNS using 5% randomly selected reflections for crossvalidation. Initial refinement was carried out with torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing using the maximum likelihood target function with the experimental phases as a prior phase distribution (MLHL) followed by rebuilding in O. At later stages of the refinement, maximum likelihood target function using amplitudes (MLF) was used and individual restrained atom B-factor was refined. Although no noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraint was utilized during the refinement process, the two protomers in the asymmetric unit appear to be almost identical, with a root mean ° square deviation of 0.551 A for the Ca atoms. The final model contains residues 1­64 and 76­152 and an N-terminal alanine derived from the vector for each protomer and 11 water molecules. The structure of Vta1CTD was determined by the MAD method using three data sets collected at the peak, the edge, and a remote wavelength of the selenium atom. Crystals belong to the P21212 space group with a unit cell ° ° ° dimension of a = 102.42 A, b = 50.71 A, c = 74.35 A. There are six molecules in the asymmetric unit. Heavy atom search, phase calculation and refinement, and density modification were carried out with autoSHARP (Vonrhein et al., 2006). An initial model was automatically built using ARP/WARP (Morris et al., 2003). The model was further refined against the native data set using CNS with intersperse manual rebuilding with O. Later rounds of refinement were performed with REFMAC5 in the CCP4 (CCP4, 1994) suite with TLS parameters incorporated (Winn et al., 2003). Each Vta1CTD dimer in the asymmetric unit was defined as one TLS group. The regions for 281­289 in protomer C and 280­289 in protomer F were modeled with alternative conformations with 50% occupancy for each conformation. The final structure contains residues 280­330 for chain A, 281­330 for chain B, 280­330 for chain C, 289­330 for chain D, 286­329 for chain E, and 280­330 for chain F, and a total of 295 water molecules. Three protomers (A, C, and F) contain extra residues derived from the vector: Gly-Ser for A and C, and a single serine for F.

In Vitro Binding Experiments GST pull-down experiments were performed following standard procedures in PBS buffer supplemented with 1mM DTT and 0.1% Triton X-100. Purified proteins were incubated with either GST alone or GST-tagged proteins immobilized on glutathione agarose beads for 40 min at 4 C. The beads were then washed extensively with the above buffer, and bound proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. The heterodimer of Vta1 was expressed using pETDuet-1 vector (Novagen) with the wild-type protein cloned in the first cassette and either wild-type or mutant proteins cloned in the second cassette. To purify the heterodimer, cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 15 mM imidazole, 5 mM b- mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mg/ml PMSF. Cell lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was applied to Ni2+-NTA resin. After extensive wash, bound proteins were eluted with the above buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The eluted protein sample was subsequently diluted into the GST pull-down buffer (see above) and incubated with S-protein agarose (Novagen) for 1 hr at 4 C. Beads with heterodimer protein bound were harvested by centrifugation, washed extensively, and either analyzed by SDS-PAGE or used for pull-down experiments as described above. Due to the similar migration positions of S-tagged Vta1 and Vps4 on SDS-PAGE, bound Vps4 proteins were detected by western blotting with anti-Vps4 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-21821).

Analytical Ultracentrifugation Protein samples were prepared in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. Three protein concentrations at OD280 of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3 were used for each sample. All sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 4 C by using An-50 Ti rotor in a Beckman ProteomeLab XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Data were collected at three different speeds (32,000, 36,000, and 39,600 rpm) and represented an average of 50 scans using a scan step size of 0.001 cm. Data were analyzed using the UltraScan II program from B. Demeler (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX) and were converted to a plot of Ln(absorbance) versus radius square. The slope of the plot is proportional to the molecular weight of the protein. Data are plotted alongside simulations using theoretical values for molecular weight of a dimer and a monomer species, with an arbitrary y axis for direct comparison.

Circular Dichroism Spectral Analysis Far-UV CD spectra were measured with a Jasco J-810 CD spectropolarimeter at 25 C using a 1 mm cuvette. The protein of 0.3 mg/ml was in a buffer containing 20 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.5). The samples were centrifuged and degassed before measurement. Spectra represent the average of five runs with buffer blanks subtracted, and the resulting spectra were normalized to molar ellipticities against the known protein concentrations with Jasco Series 810 software. ATPase Assay The ATPase activity of Vps4 was measured using an assay based on the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase (PK) coupled to the conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Huang and Hackney, 1994). Briefly, 1.25 mM Vps4 and 1.5 mM GST-Vta1 variants were first incubated in 800 ml of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-acetate [pH7.5], 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 3 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 17.5 units/ml of pyruvate kinase, 12.3 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.21 mM NADH) at room temperature. After 1.5 mM ATP was added to initiate the reaction, absorbance was monitored at 340 nm with 10 s interval from 300 s using a HP 8453E spectroscopy system and the kinetic data were analyzed as described. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method. Fluorescence Microscopy Yeast plasmids containing mutant forms of vta1 were generated by subcloning the mutated open reading frame out of the bacterial expression vectors into the plasmid pRS416-PnTAP with BamHI/SalI (Azmi et al., 2006). This resulted in TAP-tagged forms of Vta1 with the desired mutation that were subsequently subcloned into pRS415 as a Sac1/Xho1 fragment. Complementation analyses were performed by transformation of the pRS415 constructs together with GFP-tagged CPS into vta1D cells (BY4742 genetic background, Open Biosystems). Fluorescence microscopy was performed on live cells using a Nikon microscope fitted with an eGFP filter set and digital camera (Coolsnap HQ, Photometrix), and images were processed using Delta Vision deconvolution software (Applied Precision Inc.).
