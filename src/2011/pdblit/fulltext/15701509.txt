The non-steroidal anti-estrogen tamoxifen [TAM] has been in clinical use over the last two decades as a potent adjunct chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of breast cancer. It has also been given prophylactically to women with a strong family history of breast cancer. However, tamoxifen treatment has also been associated with increased endometrial cancer, possibly resulting from the reaction of metabolically activated tamoxifen derivatives with cellular DNA. Such DNA adducts can be mutagenic and the activities of isomeric adducts may be conformation-dependent. We therefore investigated the high resolution NMR solution conformation of one covalent adduct (cis-isomer, S-epimer of [TAM]G) formed from the reaction of tamoxifen [TAM] to N2-of guanine in the d(C-[TAM]GC) Ád(G-C-G) sequence context at the 11-mer oligonucleotide duplex level. Our NMR results establish that the S-cis [TAM]G lesion is accomodated within a widened minor groove without disruption of the Watson-Crick [TAM]GÁC and ¯anking Watson-Crick GÁC base-pairs. The helix axis of the bound DNA oligomer is bent by about 30  and is directed away from the minor groove adduct site. The presence of such a bulky [TAM]G adduct with components of the TAM residue on both the 5H - and the 3H -side of the modi®ed base could compromise the ®delity of the minor groove polymerase scanning machinery.

Introduction
Human DNA is continuously exposed to a variety of metabolically activated chemical intermediates that react covalently with nucleic acids to form adducts that locally perturb the architecture of duplex DNA. These adducts can be removed by a variety of repair enzymes that restore the genome to its natural state. However, if DNA repair does not occur in time, the damaged DNA sites can interfere with faithful replication which might cause mutations and, ultimately cancer, if a suf®cient number of mutations arise in proto-oncogenes which code for critical growth stimulatory proteins, or in tumor suppressor genes which code for proteins that inhibit cell division (Weinberg, 1996).

The mechanisms by which some chemicals, after binding to genomic DNA, cause mutations, while other, structurally related compounds do not, is not well understood. Of particular interest for structure-activity correlation studies are bulky chemicals because they are known to induce structural distortions in native DNA and DNA model systems (Garner, 1998). The non-steroidal anti-estrogen tamoxifen [(Z)-1{4-[2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy] phenyl}-1,2-diphenyl-1-butene] 1 (Figure 1(a)) has been in clinical use over the last two decades as a potent adjunct chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of all stages of breast cancer (Jordan, 1993; Chlebowsli et al., 1999; Chang, 1998). It has also been given prophylactically to women with a strong family history of breast cancer. Tamoxifen signi®cantly improves the prognosis against recurrence of this disease for breast cancer patients and millions of women have undergone tamoxifen treatment over the last two decades. However, there are side

effects associated with tamoxifen treatment (White, 1999) and these are manifested in increased incidence of endometrial cancers amongst breast cancer patients (Seoud et al., 1993; Magriples et al., 1993; Van Leeuwen et al., 1994; Curtis et al., 1996). Further, tamoxifen is a potent hepatocarcinogen in rats (Williams et al., 1993) resulting in a high frequency of p53 mutations (Vancustem et al., 1994) and has therefore been classi®ed as a possible human carcinogen. These serious side effects (Shibutani, 1998) have raised concerns related to its use in the treatment of breast cancer and, more importantly, as a chemopreventive agent for healthy women at elevated risk for development of this disease (White, 1999). Tamoxifen can be activated in liver microsomes (Pathak & Bodell, 1994) of rats and humans to generate reactive species that form covalent adducts with DNA (Han & Liehr, 1992). Tamoxifen is activated to N-desmethylated and hydroxylated derivatives by cytochrome P450 enzymes in mammalian cells (Mani et al., 1993; Poon et al., 1993). It has been shown that a-hydroxytamoxifen is the major proximate carcinogenic metabolite of tam-

oxifen that ultimatelty forms adducts with DNA (Phillips et al., 1994). The reactivity of the a-hydroxy derivative with DNA is enhanced signi®cantly by its further activation by liver phase II enzymes, e.g. sulfotransferases (Nuwaysir et al., 1996), that give rise to sulfate ester formation at the a-position (Davis et al., 1998; Shibutani et al., 1998a; Glatt et al., 1998). The principal DNA adducts have been identi®ed as cis and trans isomers involving a covalent linkage between the a-position of tamoxifen (Shibutani et al., 1998a,b; Osborne et al., 1996, 1997; Dasaradhi & Shibutani, 1997) or N-desmethyltamoxifen (Rajaniemi et al., 1999) and the exocyclic amino group of deoxyguanosine. Indeed, tamoxifen-induced DNA adducts have been identi®ed in leucocytes of breast cancer patients (Hemminiki et al., 1997). While Carmichael et al. (1999) did not ®nd any tamoxifen-DNA in human endometrium, two other groups provided evidence that such adducts are indeed present in endometrial tissue (Hemminiki et al., 1996; Shibutani et al., 1999). Shibutani et al. (1999) have recently described a new and highly sensitive approach towards detecting tamoxifen-DNA

379 molecular basis of DNA point mutations and deletions. A molecular understanding of these adverse effects could contribute to the development of tamoxifen analogs where the severity of endometrial side-effects could be reduced or abolished. This paper reports on the view of the lesion prior to the round of replication within the context of a duplex containing equal numbers of residues on the two strands and standard Watson-Crick complement opposite the lesion site. The tamoxifen-N2G adducts (designated [TAM]G) opposite C have been investigated within the (C-[TAM]G-C) sequence context in duplex 4 which has been successfully used previously by our group to de®ne the solution structures of the stereoisomeric benzo [a]pyrene-N2-G (reviewed by Geacintov et al., 1997) and amino¯uorene (reviewed by Patel et al., 1998) adducts at the duplex level. The modi®ed strand contains a single G residue in duplex 4 so that site-speci®c adducts can be generated postsynthetically at the strand level. The various stereoisomers of the tamoxifen-N2-G adduct can be separated by HPLC at the strand level as reported previously (Dasaradhi & Shibutani, 1997) and the puri®ed adduct-containing modi®ed strand can then be annealed with the complementary strand. We shall attempt to address the following questions in the present paper: (a) Can the covalently linked bulky tamoxifen adduct orient along the duplex without disruption of the potential WatsonCrick pairing across the modi®ed [TAM]G ÁC basepair? (b) What is the orientation of individual phenyl rings of tamoxifen adducts at the duplex level and can one or more of them intercalate into the helix? (c) Are structural perturbations localized to the tamoxifen binding site and, if not, to what extent do they propagate along the helix? (d) To what extent does the positively charged -O-CH2CH2-NH(CH3)2 side-chain contribute to adduct alignment?

adducts in endometrial tissue. The levels of tamoxifen-DNA adducts in tissues obtained from women undergoing tamoxifen therapy, identi®ed as the cis and trans epimers of (N2-deoxyguanosinyl)tamoxifen (TAM-dG), were of the order of ®ve adducts per 108 nucleotides. No adducts were detected in endometrial tissues of patients not treated with tamoxifen (Shibutani et al., 1999). Overall, this evidence suggests that the potential genotoxic effects of tamoxifen could arise not only via estrogen agonist mechanisms (White, 1999), but also from the binding of reactive tamoxifen metabolites to cellular DNA leading to tumor initiation. The major adducts form at the exocyclic 2-amino group of guanine (Osborne et al., 1996) with the potential for formation of four diastereoisomers of (N2-guanosinyl)tamoxifen (Dasaradhi & Shibutani, 1997). This re¯ects the potential of cis 2 (Figure 1(b)) and trans 3 (Figure 1(c)) alignments of the adduct across the double bond, together with two possible orientations (a and b) at each epimeric center. The structural characterization of speci®c stereoisomeric (N2-guanosinyl)tamoxifen adducts at the DNA oligomer duplex level has been facilitated by available chemical (Dasaradhi & Shibutani, 1997) and mutagenesis (Shibutani & Dasaradhi, 1997) studies on this family of adducts. Speci®cally, the four epimers of the trans and cis forms of tamoxifen-N2-G adducts prepared postsynthetically at the DNA oligomer strand level can be separated by HPLC and characterized by optical spectroscopy (Dasaradhi & Shibutani, 1997). These site-speci®c and stereoisomeric (N2-guanosinyl) tamoxifen-DNA adducts were used as templates in primer extension reactions to test their miscoding potential employing diferent mammalian DNA polymerases (Shibutani & Dasaradhi, 1997). This research established that large amounts of primer extension occurred past the lesion site with the miscoding speci®cities and frequencies dependent on the type of DNA polymerase (a, b, d and exonuclease-free Klenow fragment). Both G to T and G to C transversions, as well as deletions were observed following replication past the lesion site (Shibutani & Dasaradhi, 1997). These same lesions incorporated site-speci®cally into a single-stranded shuttle vector were shown to be mutagenic when replicated in simian kidney (COS-7) cells; the mutagenic speci®city and frequency of the two trans epimer adducts were different from one another and from those of the two epimeric adducts cis a-(N2-deoxyguanosinyl)tamoxifen (Terashima et al., 1999). The extensive miscoding potential of diastereoisomeric tamoxifen-N2-G adducts raises serious concerns related to the continued use of tamoxifen prophylactically for healthy women at high risk for breast cancer based on family history (Shibutani et al., 1999). We have initiated a comprehensive research program to determine the solution structures of stereoisomeric tamoxifen-N2-G adducts as a function of sequence context at the DNA duplex and model template-primer junction levels to understand the

Results
We outline below the synthesis, separation and puri®cation of site-speci®c stereoisomeric tamoxifen-N2-guanine adducts at the DNA oligomer level and the NMR spectral characterization of one such stereoisomeric adduct embedded within the (C[TAM]G-C) sequence context of duplex 4 (Figure 1(d)). Stereoisomeric [TAM]G adduct containing duplex Racemic trans-a-acetoxytamoxifen was reacted with the standard 5H -d(CCATCGCTACC) 11-mer sequence containing a single central guanine modi®cation site [in the (C-*G-C) sequence context, where *G is the adduct site]. The four stereoisomeric tamoxifen-N2-guanine adduct containing DNA oligomers were completely separated employing preparative C18 column HPLC conditions as shown in Supplementary Figure S1(a)

380 (see Materials and Methods for experimental details). The presence of four stereoisomeric adducts re¯ects the formation of a single chiral center at the tamoxifen-N2-guanine covalent linkage site together with the cis 2 or trans 3 alignment about the double bond (Figure 1(b) and (c), respectively). The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the four stereoisomeric tamoxifen-N2-guanine adduct containing DNA oligomers establish that HPLC fractions F2 and F3 exhibit similar pro®les which are distinct from the pro®les observed for HPLC fractions F1 and F4 (Supplementary Figure S2). We have attempted to characterize the structural features associated with these distinct pairs of CD patterns observed for tamoxifen-N2-guanine adduct containing DNA oligomers by undertaking NMR studies of individual stereoisomeric adducts at the duplex level. In this work we focus on the stereoisomeric tamoxifen-N2-guanine adduct containing DNA oligomer in HPLC fraction F3. This oligonucleotide was annealed with its complementary strand to generate the adduct positioned

NMR assignments The exchangeable proton spectrum (6.0 to 14.0 ppm) of the [TAM]GÁ C 11-mer duplex in H2O buffer at 0  C is plotted in Figure 2a. Narrow imino proton resonances are observed between 12.2 and 13.8 ppm together with an additional broad exchangeable resonance at %9.4 ppm. The imino proton of [TAM]G6 resonates at highest ®eld (12.6 ppm) and partially overlaps with the imino proton of G18 of the ¯anking G ÁC pair in adduct containing duplex 4. We demonstrate intact Watson-Crick [TAM]G6 ÁC17 pairing at the lesion site based on NOEs between the imino proton of [TAM]G6 and the amino (cross-peaks a and c) and H5 (crosspeak d) protons of C17 in an expanded NOESY contour plot in H2O solution at 0  C as shown in Figure 3. The NOE patterns further permit the assignment of the exchangeable proton at 9.5 ppm to the NH proton of the positively charged

The imino protons are observed between 12.2 and 13.8 ppm. An exchangeable resonance observed at %9.4 ppm is assigned to the amino proton of the modi®ed guanine at the adduct site.

The base (6.6 to 8.5 ppm) and sugar (5.2 to 6.6 ppm) protons are quite narrow at this temperature and amenable to structural characterization. We also detect somewhat broadened phenyl ring protons between 6.8 and 7.0 ppm suggestive of aromatic ring ¯ips in the intermediate time scale for the bound tamoxifen in the adduct duplex.

381 The non-exchangeable proton spectrum (5.2 to 8.5 ppm) of the [TAM]G ÁC 11-mer duplex in 2H2O buffer at 20  C exhibits the narrow base (6.7 to 8.5 ppm) and sugar (5.0 to 6.4 ppm) protons (Figure 2(b)) necessary for structural characterization. We also detect both narrow (6.9 to 7.4 ppm) and broadened (6.6 to 6.9 ppm) phenyl ring protons (Figure 2(b)) suggestive of different aromatic ring ¯ip time scales for the two phenyl rings and one para-substituted phenoxy ring of the bound tamoxifen in the adduct duplex. We have also recorded a NOESY spectrum (250 ms mixing time) on the [TAM]GÁC 11-mer duplex in 2H2O buffer at 20  C. An expanded contour plot correlating NOEs between base (6.7 to 8.4 ppm) and sugar H1H (5.0 to 6.3 ppm) protons is shown in Figure 4. Sequential NOEs are traced without interruption between base protons and their own and 5H -¯anking sugar H1H protons from T4 to T8 on the modi®ed strand (continuous lines) and from A15 to A19 on the unmodi®ed strand (broken lines) in Figure 4. The aromatic protons of the para-substituted phenoxy ring and the two non-substituted phenyl rings (one of which exhibits broadened resonances) show several intermolecular NOEs in the [TAM]GÁ C11-mer duplex (boxed cross-peaks in Figure 4). The protons at the linkage site in the covalently bound tamoxifen in the [TAM]G ÁC11-mer duplex were assigned in the following manner. We detect an NOE cross-peak (peak b, Figure 3) between the imino (12.60 ppm) and amino (7.87 ppm) protons of the 2-amino substituted [TAM]G6 residue in the NOESY data set in H2O solution. The amino proton of [TAM]G6 exhibits an NOE to the Ha proton (4.83 ppm), which in turn exhibits an NOE to the CH3b (1.10 ppm) protons at the linkage site. The protons in the three aromatic rings of the covalently bound tamoxifen in the [TAM]G ÁC 11mer duplex were assigned in the following manner: The ortho and meta protons on the substituted phenyl ring I gave a typical AB pattern of doublets with the up®eld doublet at 7.20 ppm, which exhibits the stronger NOE to the OCH2 protons assigned to the meta (2,6) position, while the down®eld doublet at 7.40 ppm, which exhibits the weaker NOE to the OCH2 protons, assigned to the ortho (3,5) position (Supplementary Figure S3). Previous studies on [TAM]G monomers have established that the substituted phenyl ring I aromatic protons resonate down®eld of 7.0 ppm for the cis alignment about the double bond and up®eld of 7.0 ppm for the trans alignment about the double bond (Dasaradhi & Shibutani, 1997). This must re¯ect up®eld ring current contributions at protons of ring I from phenyl ring III on the same side of the double bond in the trans isomer (Figure 1(c)), while comparable ring currents would be absent since ring III is on the opposite side of the double bond in the cis isomer (Figure 1(b)). Therefore, our data are consistent with a cis alignment about the double bond for the stereoisomeric [TAM]GÁC11mer duplex under consideration. We observe

Intermolecular NOEs between protons of the bound tamoxifen and the DNA are highlighted by boxed cross-peaks.

Sequential NOEs between base protons and their own and 5H -¯anking sugar H1H protons have been traced for the modi®ed strand from T4 to T8 (continuous lines) and for the unmodi®ed strand from A15 to G19 (broken lines).

strong NOEs between the ortho and meta aromatic protons of ring I and protons at 6.85 and 7.00 ppm (Figure S3), which must originate from adjacent ring II in the cis isomer (Figure 1(b)). The ortho (6.85 ppm), meta (7.00 ppm) and para (6.92 ppm) protons on ring II were assigned based on the relative magnitude of their NOEs (in decreasing order) to the CH3b protons at the linkage site (Figure S3). The remaining aromatic protons are quite broad and are assigned to the ortho (6.81 ppm), meta (6.68 ppm) and para (6.55 ppm) protons on ring III based on the relative magnitude of their NOEs to the CH3b protons at the linkage site (Figure S3). Intermolecular restraints We have identi®ed 41 intermolecular NOEs (Table 1), which provide critical restraints in guiding the structure calculations. Several of these intermolecular NOEs were treated as ambiguous restraints since interchangeable assignments were

allowed for tamoxifen phenyl rings labeled II and III. The proton at the chiral linkage site, aromatic protons on the para-substituted phenoxy ring (labeled ring I) and one of the two phenyl rings (labeled ring II) show intermolecular NOEs to protons on the modi®ed strand while the CH3 protons at the chiral linkage site and the aromatic protons on the other phenyl ring (labeled ring III) show intermolecular NOEs to protons on the unmodi®ed strand (Table 1 and Figure 5). At the start of the structural characterization, we knew neither the chirality at the covalent linkage site nor the cis/trans alignment about the double bond of the [TAM]G6 adduct in the stereoisomeric F3 adduct (Figure S1(a)) of the [TAM]G ÁC 11-mer duplex. Nevertheless, we proceeded on the assumption that the available intermolecular restraints and their distribution between modi®ed and unmodi®ed strands would likely yield one unique solution with the potential for providing both the chirality and the

alignment across the double bond in the system under investigation. Structure calculations Our inability to initially distinguish between the four stereoisomers at the [TAM]G6 adduct site required a stepwise computational protocol for structure determination of the F3 adduct (Figure S1(a)) of the [TAM]G ÁC 11-mer duplex under investigation. We therefore used the torsion angle space DUPLEX program (Hingerty et al., 1989) for the ®rst stage computations to elucidate which of the four stereoisomers (R-trans, R-cis, S-trans and S-cis) was able to best satisfy the experimental distance restraints. In addition, two distance lists were considered since interchangeable assignments were allowed for tamoxifen phenyl rings II and III. The S-cis [TAM]G6 adduct isomer along with List 1 restraints (see Materials and Methods for details) best satis®ed the experimental distance restraints, and a family of four such structures served as starting models for second stage molecular dynamics computations using the È XPLOR program (Brunger, 1992). The protocol for the molecular dynamics calculations, including intensity re®nement, are outlined in detail in the Materials and Methods. Ten intensity re®nement trials were initiated with each of the four DUPLEX based S-cis [TAM]G6 aligned starting structures with good convergence amongst intensity re®ned structures. The pairwise r.m.s.d. values amongst the ten lowest energy structures containing the Ê least number of violations is 1.25(Æ0.26) A for the central (T4-C5-[TAM]G6-C7-T8) Á(A15-G16-C17G18-A19) 5-mer segment of the F3 [TAM]G6 adduct-containing duplex (Table 2). Structrural features Stereo views of ten superpositioned intensityre®ned solution structures spanning the central (T4-C5-[TAM]G6-C7-T8) Á(A15-G16-C17-G18-A19) 5-mer segment of the adduct-containing duplex are shown in Figure 6. The view in Figure 6(a) looks into the minor groove which accomodates the bound tamoxifen adduct while that in Figure 6(b) is rotated by 90  along the helix axis

and emphasizes the curvature centered about the covalent binding site. It is apparent that the bound tamoxifen (in yellow) , except for its O-(CH2)2N(CH3)2 side-chain (in orange), is well de®ned amongst the intensity-re®ned solution structures of the adduct duplex. Further, the structure about the T8 ÁA15 pair on one side of [TAM]G ÁC adduct site is better de®ned than the structure about its T4 ÁA19 counterpart which is located on the opposite side of [TAM]G ÁC adduct site. It is also apparent that tamoxifen bound in the widened minor groove compresses the major groove on the opposite face resulting in a bend in the helix axis. The corresponding stick and space-®lling views of one representative intensity re®ned structure are shown in Figure 7(a) and (b), respectively. Two views of the (C5-[TAM]G6-C7) Á(G16-C17-G18) segment emphasizing the relative alignments within the minor groove of the two phenyl rings (labeled II and III) and one phenoxy ring (labeled I) of the covalently bound tamoxifen are shown in Figure 8(a) and (b), respectively. The minor groove widths are visually compared for idealized B-form DNA and the representative intensity re®ned structure of the [TAM]G ÁC 11mer duplex in Figure 9(a) and (b), respectively. We have also measured the shortest phosphorus-phosphorus distance across the adduct-containing minor groove (Figure 9(c)) amongst the intensityre®ned solution structures of the [TAM]G ÁC11-mer duplex.

Discussion
We have solved the ®rst solution structure of tamoxifen bound covalently to the 2-amino group of guanine within the context of duplex DNA. The study has been undertaken on one of the four possible stereoisomeric [TAM]G adducts, labeled F3 following HPLC puri®cation, and positioned opposite C within a C-[TAM]G-C sequence context. Our study establishes how the bulky covalently-bound tamoxifen ligand, with its three aromatic rings positioned across a double bond, can be accomodated within the widened minor groove of DNA without disruption of the modi®ed [TAM]G ÁC pair.

Vertical broken lines are drawn through the ortho and meta protons of ring I and the ortho, meta and para protons of rings II and III.

the cis/trans isomerization about the double bond. We made no prior assumptions regarding the stereochemistry of the F3 isomer during the structural analysis reported in the present study. In essence, we considered all four possible stereoisomers during the analysis of the NMR data of the [TAM]G ÁC 11-mer duplex and found that the

These restraints involve aromatic protons of the bound tamoxifen. These Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding restraints are based on experimental NOE data and include pairing at the [TAM]G6ÁC17 site.

experimental data were consistent only with S-cis stereochemistry. Con®rmation of the cis stereochemistry about the double bond emerged later when we realized that the observed chemical shifts of the ortho and meta protons of the substituted phenyl ring I (down®eld of 7.0 ppm) were consistent with this conclusion (Dasaradhi & Shibutani, 1997). Intact [TAM]G6 ÁC17 pair Tamoxifen contains two phenyl rings and one phenoxy ring projecting from the ethylene scaffold. Covalent adduct formation of tamoxifen with the exocyclic amino group of guanine would position these aromatic rings within the minor groove. An interesting question was whether the three aromatic rings could be accomodated in the minor groove without disruption of the stereoisomeric [TAM]G6 ÁC17 pair and/or its ¯anking C5 ÁG18 and C7 Á G16 pairs. Our observation of NOEs between the imino proton of [TAM]G6 and the amino protons of C17 (peaks (a) and (c), Figure 3) is characteristic of Watson-Crick [TAM]G6 ÁC17 pairing alignment. Further, related NOEs also establish C5 ÁG18 and C7 ÁG16 pair formation in the [TAM]GÁC 11-mer duplex. Therefore, our NMR data establish that the two phenyl and one phenoxy rings of S-cis-[TAM]G adduct can be accomodated within the minor groove opposite C without disruption of the Watson-Crick [TAM]GÁC and ¯anking G ÁC pairs. Alignment of tamoxifen aromatic rings The relative orientations of the substituted phenoxy ring I and two phenyl rings II and III of bound tamoxifen, as well as their positions relative

to the DNA helix, are well de®ned within the ensemble of re®ned structures (Figure 6). Ring I is directed towards the 5H terminus of the modi®ed strand while rings II and III are directed towards the 3H terminus of the modi®ed strand. The CH3a group at the chiral site is directed towards the 5H terminus of the modi®ed strand while the Ha at the linkage site is in the plane of the modi®ed guanine ring. The spread in dihedral angles linking the phenyl rings to the double bond (linkages C4-C7 for ring I, C7-C8 for ring II and C14-C15 for ring III; see nomenclature in Supplementary Figure S4) are small and range between 2  and 4  amongst the re®ned structures. The charged -O-CH2-CH2-NH 3 tail of the bound tamoxifen, positioned within the walls of the minor groove in four of the ten re®ned structures, was less well de®ned. Rings I, II and III of the bound tamoxifen make a series of intermolecular contacts with the ¯oor of the minor groove and the sugar-phosphate backbone which are shown schematically in Figure 8. Ring III is positioned face down along the ¯oor of the minor groove, making van der Waals contacts with the base edges of the C7 ÁG16 and [TAM]G6 ÁC17 base-pairs (Figure 8). We detect intermolecular contacts between C17/C19 atoms of ring III and O2 of C7, and between C18 of ring III and N2 of G16. Ring II is inclined relative to the ¯oor of the minor groove, is closer to the covalently modi®ed strand, and forms intermolecular contacts with the phosphate group at the C7-T8 step. These contacts are between C11 of ring II and H O2P and O5 of T8, and between C9 of ring II and H O3 of C7. Ring I is somewhat closer to the minor groove surface of the unmodi®ed strand with intermolecular juxtaposition of its aromatic protons with the sugar ring of A19 (C2 of ring I and C4H of

We observe averaged resonances for the ortho protons and meta protons of tamoxifen rings I, II and III in the NMR spectra of the [TAM]G ÁC 11-mer duplex at 20  C. This implies that phenyl ring ¯ips are in the fast exchange region. However, the aromatic protons of ring III are broader than those of rings I and II, implying that ring III ¯ips at a slower rate than ring I and II in the fast

exchange limit. It should be noted that ring III packs against the ¯oor of the minor groove (Figure 8), while rings I and II are directed outwards from the helix (Figure 8(b)).

groove. This widening is associated with space constraints re¯ecting placement of all three rings of tamoxifen in the minor groove. The width across the minor groove (P[n] to P[nH  3] separation) centered about the tamoxifen adduct site is plotted in Figure 9(c). The minor groove width doubles within the section centered about the tamoxifenN2-guanine adduct site. Minor groove widening is coupled to the positive roll angles at the C5[TAM]G6 (9.0 Æ 5.8  ), [TAM]G6-C7 (9.5 Æ 3.9  ) and C7-T8 (12.5 Æ 3.3  ) steps. There is considerable plasticity associated with the dimensions of the minor groove of DNA. Previous studies of distamycin-DNA complexes had established that non-covalent binding of this drug can involve side-by-side head-to-tail dimerization at A ÁT rich sites within a widened minor groove (Pelton & Wemmer, 1989). In addition, pyrrole-imidazole conjugates have also been shown to adopt side-by-side alignments which can be accommodated within a widened minor groove (Wade et al., 1992; Wemmer & Dervan, 1997). The present study extends the above results to covalent adduct-DNA complexes centered about a G ÁC rich segment of the minor groove which readily accomodates the three aromatic rings of the bound tamoxifen. The helix axis of the bound DNA oligomer is bent by %30  and is directed away from the minor

groove adduct site. The slide helical parameter has opposite signs at the adjacent C5-[TAM]G6 Ê Ê (À0.9 Æ 0.4) A and [TAM]G6-C7 (0.9 Æ 0.1) A steps on the modi®ed strand. As a result, the [TAM]G6 ÁC17 base-pair is pulled out from the Ê helix axis by %1 A towards the minor groove. In essence, the bound tamoxifen induces localized perturbations spanning ®ve base-pairs centered about the binding site, as monitored by an increase in minor groove width (Figure 9(c)) and a bend in the helix axis. Biological significance Shibutani & Dasaradhi (1997) have studied DNA replication in vitro catalyzed by several different mammalian polymerases, and found that the cis-a[TAM]G and the other stereoisomeric a-[TAM]G lesions can induce mutations. The cis-a-[TAM]G lesion is an example of a bulky minor groove adduct of the type observed in the case of the diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene stereoisomers covalently attached to N2-dG (Cosman et al., 1992; De los Santos et al., 1992). It is interesting to speculate how such bulky minor groove adducts can in¯uence DNA replication. Recent crystal structures of T7 DNA polymerase (Doublie & Ellenberger, 1998), Taq DNA polymerase (Li et al., 1998), DNA

The tamoxifen (in yellow) is in a stick representation while the DNA (in white with backbone phosphorus in red) is in a space ®lling representation.

polymerase b (Sawaya et al., 1997), Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase (Kiefer et al., 1998), and HIV-1 RT polymerase (Huang et al., 1998), all bound to DNA, reveal that these polymerases make sequence-independent contacts to a widened minor groove of the DNA immediately downstream of the polymerase active site. These contacts are believed to constitute the mechanism whereby the polymerase can detect replication errors by scanning for the correct geometry of the newly formed base-pair in the minor groove of the nascent complex (Bebenek et al., 1997; Kunkel & Wilson, 1998; Brautigam & Steitz, 1998). It has been noted that a primer-template mismatch, resulting in a distorted base-pair at that site, would alter these interactions with the polymerase, perhaps triggering a movement of the misreplicated primer strand to the 3H to 5H exonuclease site (Doblie et al., 1998). The presence of a bulky adduct such as the [TAM]G lesion, with components on both the 5H and the 3H -side of the modi®ed base, could compromise the ability of the polymerase to scan the minor groove, if a structure of this type persisted at the primer/template complex. Therefore, the transfer of the primer strand containing mismatched base to the exonuclease site would be impeded, favoring the persistence of a misincorporated base, thus enhancing the probability of mutation.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of stereoisomeric [TAM]G adduct containing duplex The racemic a-acetoxytamoxifen was prepared by the procedures outlined by Dasaradhi & Shibutani (1997).

The tamoxifen-modi®ed oligonucleotides were prepared by reacting the trans-a-acetoxytamoxifen with the 11-mer sequence 5H -d(CCATCGCTACC) containing a single guanine modi®cation site. The oligonucleotide (3.2 mM) was dissolved in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 6.5). The a-acetoxytamoxifen (37 mM) was dissolved in ethanol. Two ml of this ethanol solution were added to 8 ml of the aqueous oligonucleotide solution, and incubated under constant stirring at ambient temperature for 48 hours. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged, and the unreacted tamoxifen was extracted with ethyl ether. The tamoxifen-oligonucleotide reaction products were then separated from one another using reverse phase HPLC on a PRP-1 (polystyrene-divinylbenzene, 305 mm Â 7.0 mm, Hamilton, Reno, NE) column. A 5-30 % acetonitrile/sodium triethylammonium acetate solution (50 mM) gradient with a ¯ow rate of 2 ml/minute was employed. A typical elution pro®le is shown in Supplementary Figure S1(a). Four distinguishable elution peaks are recognizable, labeled F1-F4. Each of these fractions was collected separately and re-puri®ed by HPLC employing a C18 Microsorb, 250 mm Â 4.6 mm column (Rainin-Varian Associates, Walnut Creek, CA). The CD spectra of the puri®ed tamoxifen-modi®ed oligonucleotides in each fraction are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The fractions F2 and F3 and fractions F1 and F4 exhibit pairs of similar CD spectra. It has been previously demonstrated that guanine in DNA is the major reaction target of a-acetoxytamoxifen (Osborne et al., 1996, 1997; Dasaradhi & Shibutani, 1997), forming predominantly a-tamoxifen-N2-2H -deoxyguanosine ([TAM]G) mononucleoside adducts (the a-position of tamoxifen is linked to the exocyclic 2-amino group of 2H -deoxyguanosine). These mononucleoside adduct standards were prepared by reacting 2H -deoxyguanosine with racemic a-acetoxytamoxifen by methods described previously (Osborne et al., 1996, 1997; Shibutani & Dasaradhi, 1997). When the resulting diastereoisomeric [TAM]G adducts were subjected to reverse phase HPLC analysis, four elution maxima, similar to those reported

by Dasaradhi & Shibutani (1997) were observed (data not shown); in that work, the ®rst two fractions were identi®ed as the epimeric trans-adducts (fr-1 and fr-2), and the last two as epimeric cis adducts (fr-3 and fr-4). This NMR structural study was performed with the tamoxifen-modi®ed oligonucleotide in fraction F3 (Figure S1(a)). In order to identify the stereochemical characteristics of this tamoxifen-modi®ed oligonucleotide, the DNA in fraction F3 was subjected to enzymatic digestion with snake venom phosphodiesterase I, and alkaline phosphatase as described by Dasaradhi &

Shibutani (1997) to generate a-tamoxifen-2H -deoxynucleoside adducts. The enzymatic digest contained the unmodi®ed bases dC, dT and dA, but no dG; instead of the unmodi®ed dG, a single late-eluting peak was observed, as reported previously (Shibutani & Dasaradhi, 1997). This fraction co-eluted with the a-tamoxifen-N2-dG mononucleoside adduct standard fr-3 (data not shown), known to be a cis-adduct (Osborne et al., 1996), and both fractions exhibited nearly identical CD spectra (shown in Figure S1(b)). Therefore, the adduct F3 contained oligonucleotides with a single, site-speci®c cis-[TAM]G residue (cis-a-tamoxifen-N2-dG adduct).

390
About 1.5 mg of the F3 oligonucleotide was annealed with its complementary strand to generate the adduct positioned opposite C (designated [TAM]G Á C 11-mer duplex, Figure 1(d)). The NMR studies described here were performed with this modi®ed duplex. NMR experiments All one and two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity plus 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. A combination of through space nuclear Overhauser effect (NOESY) and through bond correlated (COSY and TOCSY) two-dimensional spectra were recorded on the [TAM]G ÁC 11-mer duplex in 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM phosphate, aqueous solution (pH 6.8). The NOESY data sets on the [TAM]G ÁC 11-mer duplex in H2O buffer were collected at one (200 ms) mixing time at 0  C, while the NOESY data sets in 2H2O buffer were collected at ®ve (50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 ms) mixing times with a relaxation delay of 3.2 seconds at 20  C. TOCSY data sets with spin lock times of 60 and 80 ms were collected in 2H2O buffer at 20  C. NOESY and TOCSY data sets in 2H2O were also collected at 0  C and 10  C to facilitate resonance assignments. Standard procedures were used to assign resonances, monitor NOE buildups Ê (®xed cytosine H5-H6 separation of 2.45 A as a reference for non-exchangeable protons) and assign distance (Æ20 % for non-exchangeable protons) and intensity bounds as outlined previously (Gu et al., 1999). The base proton to sugar H1H NOE cross-peaks in the shortest mixing time NOESY data set in 2H2O were evaluated to qualitatively differentiate syn and anti glycosidic torsion angles. The proton-proton vicinal coupling constants among sugar protons were analyzed from phase-sensitive COSY data to qualitatively distinguish between C3H endo and C2H -endo family of sugar puckers. Molecular mechanics refinement with DUPLEX First stage restrained conformational searches with energy minimization were carried out with DUPLEX, a molecular mechanics program for nucleic acids that performs potential energy minimization in the reduced variable domain of torsion angle space (Hingerty et al., 1989). Full details of this approach are given in our earlier work (Cosman et al., 1995). The geometry of tamoxifen adducts to N2 of guanine, R-trans, R-cis, S-trans and S-cis (see Figure 1 for structures) was obtained by building the adducts with INSIGHTII from MSI, Inc. and then minimizing the structure using Gaussian94 (Frisch et al., 1995) with the CNDO method. This provided equilibrium bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles needed for DUPLEX. Partial charges consistent with those in DUPLEX were also computed with GAUSSIAN94 and the CNDO method. These are available from one of us, Dr Suse Broyde, on request. Rotation barriers for each of the ¯exible torsion angles in the tamoxifen adduct were assigned based on values for similar atom types in a second generation force ®eld (Cornell et al., 1995). In the ®rst stage of the computations restrained energy minimization searches were carried out with DUPLEX for each isomer, R-trans, R-cis, S-trans, and S-cis, since the nature of the isomer (identi®ed subsequently as S-cis) was only characterized chemically with certainty following completion of structure determination. At this stage interproton distance restraints involving only tamoxifen-tamoxifen and tamoxifen-

Stereoisomeric Tamoxifen-DNA Adduct DNA (see Table 1) protons were employed. To account for uncertainty in distinguishing phenyl ring II and ring III, two interproton distance restraint lists were created at this stage, List 1 and List 2. In List 2 all distance restraints involving H9/H13 and H16/ H20, H10/H12 and H17/H19, H11/H18 were interchanged from those in List 1 (see Supplementary Figure S4 for tamoxifen numbering nomenclature). An energy minimized B-DNA (Arnott et al., 1976) central 5-mer segment of the duplex 11-mer was ®rst created. Then 16 energy minimization trials were carried out for each isomer, with each of the two NOE lists, for a total of 128 trials. In each set of 16 trials the linkage torsion angles aH and bH (Figure S4) were each started at 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees in all combinations. The other ¯exible torsion angles within the tamoxifen skeleton were initiated with suitable values for each speci®c torsion (available from one of us, Dr Suse Broyde, on request). DUPLEX goodness-of-®t indices (Cosman et al., 1992) (de®ned in Supplementary Table S1) revealed that the NMR distance restraints could only be met by the S-cis isomer, using List 1 restraints. Supplementary Table S2 gives results for all 16 trials for the S-cis isomer and List 1 restraints. Three of the 16 structures (numbers 7, 10 and 11) belonged to the same family and had nearly identical combined goodness-of-®t indices (Supplementary Table S2). The one which also had the lowest energy (no. 11) was then embedded in an energy minimized B-DNA duplex 11-mer, and reminimized with the List 1 distance restraints. The restraints were then released to provide a second, different 11-mer. Another related pair of 11-mers was created by removing NOEs to H5H and H5HH protons from the List 1 distance restraints during minimization. Molecular dynamics refinement with XPLOR The four structures obtained from the DUPLEX computations were used as starting points for the second stage of the re®nement using X-PLOR-based molecular È dynamics computations (Brunger, 1992). We note that some of the phenyl ring protons could not be assigned unambiguously. For example, for para-substituted ring I, the protons H3/H5 were indistinguishable due to rapid aromatic ring ¯ipping. The total number of the ambiguously assigned tamoxifen protons is 12 (two pairs in each of three aromatic rings) resulting in a mixture of ambiguous and non-ambiguous restraints (see Table 1). During the ®rst stage of the re®nement with the DUPLEX program, the upper bounds for these restraints Ê were increased by 2.5 A to account for the ambiguity in the proton positions. At the X-PLOR stage of the re®nement, we were able to treat the ambiguous NOE restraints rigorously with the ``sum averaging'' option. The re®nement procedure also included DNA-DNA distance restraints (only tamoxifen-DNA and tamoxifentamoxifen restraints were used during the DUPLEX computations) and back-calculations of unambiguously assigned NOESY cross-peaks. The pseudoenergy function included two types of restraints: (i) intensity restraints for non-ambiguous, non-exchangeable protons were imposed as square-well potentials with an exponent of 2 in the penalty function, an isotropic correlation time of 5 ns, and anisotropic bound estimates of 10 %; (ii) distance restraints for non-exchangeable protons were retained throughout our protocol as square-well potentials with uniform 20 % estimation of errors and a Ê Ê 30 kcal/mol A2 force constant. A 4.5 A cutoff was

Stereoisomeric Tamoxifen-DNA Adduct imposed for computing relaxation pathways and the Ê dynamics were carried out with a tolerance of 0.03 A. Ten intensity re®nement trials were initiated with each of the four starting structures heated to 1000 K through the assignment of an arbitrary Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution corresponding to a temperature of 1000 K. After a 4 ps dynamics evolution at that temperature, the system was gradually cooled to 300 K during 7.2 ps with the ``heat bath'' method, and then equilibrated at 300 K for 2.4 ps. After equilibration, the coordinates were subjected to energy minimization to a Ê gradient of 0.1 kcal/mol A2. All 40 resulting structures converged to the same family of conformations, with very similar positions for the phenyl aromatic rings. Our calculations incorporated the possibility for the ¯ipping of the tamoxifen aromatic rings: the corresponding atoms were equivalent chemically, and the corresponding restraints were treated as being ambiguous. Therefore, in the ®nal structures, each phenyl ring can be rotated through 180  to produce an equivalent structure. We have rotated some rings by 180  to produce the smallest r.m.s.d. between tamoxifen adducts in order to facilitate comparison, analysis and discussion of the re®ned structures. Coordinates deposition The coordinates of the S-cis-[TAM]G Á C 11-mer duplex have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (accession code: 1fj5) from whom copies can be obtained.
