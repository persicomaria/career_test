Using a water-soluble conjugated polymer (CP) as a sensing probe, we developed a rapid colorimetric detection strategy for pH-driven conformational conversion of DNA i-motif structure. Two sensing configurations were designed: one used CP only to detect the conversion between i-motif and random-coiled state of a C-rich single-strand DNA, the other used CP and a complementary single-strand DNA to investigate the conversion of duplex to i-motif equilibrium. All the conversions would lead to color change observed directly with naked eyes within a few minutes. The limitation of detection (LOD) is as low as 40 nM. More importantly, reversible conformational conversions by adjusting the pH of the system could also be detected. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction As is well known, C-rich DNA sequences with the potential to form closely packed i-motifs based on intercalated C·C+ base pairs are frequent in the human genome, especially the human telomere DNA (Ahmed et al., 1994; Gehring et al., 1993). These unique structures often participate in important biological processes and even have close relationship with diseases such as cancer. For example, the conformation of i-motif in human telomere can inhibit the activity of cancer cell telomerase (an enzyme that stabilizes chromosome ends by adding tandem telomeric DNA repeats to the 3 single-stranded overhangs), which inhibits the synthesis of telomere DNA and thus the multiplication of cancer cells (Gehring et al., 1993; Li et al., 2006). Now the i-motif has been an attractive drug target for cancer chemotherapy and for modulation of gene transcription (Ahmed et al., 1994; Li et al., 2006). Obviously, it becomes very important to detect the presence and conformational conversion of i-motif structures. Since the discovery of the DNA i-motif, significant progress in characterization of the structure has been made in recent years (Gehring et al., 1993; Gueron and Leroy, 2000). Some methods to drive the conversion of the conformation, such as cationic species and concentration, pH, temperature, surfactants, light irradiation, electro-induction and molecular crowding, have also been devel-

oped (Liu et al., 2007a; Phan and Mergny, 2002; Sharma et al., 2007; Shu et al., 2005). However, most detection methods for imotif structure still dominate in circular dichroism (CD), UV­vis adsorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Benevides et al., 1996; Chen et al., 1999; Manzini et al., 1994; McQuade et al., 2000; Mergny, 1999; Phan et al., 2001; Phan and Mergny, 2002; Thomas et al., 2007; Xu and Sugiyama, 2006). These instrument-intensive methods are costly, time-consuming and inconvenient, and they also include chemical modification which needs complex synthetic process. More recently, some simple methods for the detection of the i-motif conversion have been developed by using new materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) (Li et al., 2006) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) (Seela and Budow, 2006; Sharma et al., 2007). Herein, we present a new method to detect the conformational conversion of i-motif using another new material, the watersoluble conjugated polymer, as a sensing probe. Water-soluble conjugated polymers (CPs) have large, delocalized molecular structures and exhibit unique optical characteristics. They have been reported to produce amplified signal up to million fold compared with their monomers, which is attributed to ultrafast energy transfer of excitons along the conjugated backbones (Gaylord et al., 2005). Recently, it has attracted much attention to use CPs as either chemical or biological sensing elements (Dore et al., 2004; Fan et al., 2005, 2002, 2003; Gaylord et al., 2002; He et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005). For example, Ho and Leclerc (2004) reported an optical sensor based on a water-soluble polythiophene, which could transduce the different conformations of the aptamers of thrombin

and K+ into optical signals. More recently, we developed successfully a highly selective Hg2+ optical sensor by using a polythiophene and a label-free oligonucleotide probe (Liu et al., 2007b). Moreover, CPs was verified to be a potential tool for visual detection of DNA (Ho et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2006). All these inspired us to design a colorimetric sensing protocol for the conformational conversion of i-motif based on the conjugated polymer. The conversion would lead to color change observed directly with naked eyes within a few minutes. More importantly, reversible conformational conversion by adjusting the pH of the system could also be detected. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Cationic polythiophene (PMNT) was prepared according to a literature (Ho et al., 2002). The polymer's concentration was given using its monomer. Two oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Sangon Inc. (Shanghai, China) and their concentration was calculated according to their absorbance at 260 nm. All solutions were prepared with MilliQ water (18.2 M ·cm) from a Millipore system. More details for materials and solution can be found in Tables S1 and S2 in supplementary information. 2.2. Instrumentation All assay experiments were performed at room temperature and photographs were taken with an Olympus C-5060 Wide Zoom digital camera. UV­visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer. All fluorescence spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 392 nm on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer equipped with a Xenon lamp excitation source. 2.3. Detection of i-motif conformational conversion In typical experiments for the detection of conformational conversion between i-motif and random-coiled ssDNA, 2.5 L of 100 M C-rich ssDNA solutions was added to 2.5 L of solutions with different pH values. After 10 min at room temperature,

5 L of 1 mM PMNT solution was added, then the color change was recorded using digital camera. A random sequence (see Table S2 in supplementary information for details) was used as a negative control. In typical experiments for the detection of conformational conversion between i-motif and duplex, 2.5 L of 100 M C-rich ssDNA of and its complementary was added to 5 mL of solutions with different pH values. After 10 min at room temperature, 5 L of 1 mM PMNT was added, then the color change was recorded using digital camera. 3. Results and discussion Scheme 1 illustrates the conversion between i-motif and random-coiled state of a C-rich single-strand DNA (ssDNA). At pH below 6.5, the cytosines in the C-rich sequence were protonated to a C·C+ base pairs which made the ssDNA adopt a closely packed fourstranded i-motif structure. When it interacts with positive charged PMNT electrostatically, they form a complex of i-motif/PMNT and show consistent yellow color. However, at pH above 6.5, because the cytosine could not be protonated, the ssDNA appears as a random-coil conformation. It forms a more rigid and conjugated complex with the PMNT and shows red color (its fluorescence is quenched by the ­ stacking). In a typical sensing experiment, a human telomeric C-rich ssDNA sequence (d[(CCC(TTACCC)3 ]) was selected to perform the conversion between the i-motif and ss-DNA at different pH values from 3.6 to 9.9. As shown in Fig. 1A1, the PMNT solution appears yellow in color at pH 3.6­5.0, demonstrating the formation of imotif. However, the other systems (pH 6.5­9.9) appear red in color, meaning that no i-motif structure is present. In fact, when the positive charged PMNT was added to the system consisting of i-motif, they formed an electrostatic complex with an i-motif-like structure which is similar to the conjugated backbone of pure PMNT. So we observed yellow color (an absorbance peak at relative short wavelength). While the same C-rich sequence with random-coiled structure was combined with the positive charged PMNT, a more conjugated and planar structure was formed, which changed the color to red (an absorbance peak in the relative long wavelength). This result is consistent with previous report (Dore et al., 2004;

Ho and Leclerc, 2004). A control experiment was done with a random ssDNA sequence. Because the random sequence cannot form i-motif structure at any pH, so it always appears as a random-coil and form an invariable red complex (Fig. 1A2). It was reported that any change of environment can change the state of the electrons on the conjugated backbone and then affect the optical characteristics of conjugated polymers (Ho and Leclerc, 2003). For example, some special anionic ions such as ClO4 - and I- have been demonstrated to affect the optical properties of the conjugated polymer (Ho and Leclerc, 2003). Thus we did a blank control experiment to confirm that the designed detection system does work with the conformation of i-motif but not with the anionic ions in it. Solutions in equal volume but at different pH (without

any ssDNA) were added to the same PMNT solution to demonstrate the effects of different pH buffer on the characteristic of PMNT. As shown in Fig. 1A3, the color of the systems at different pH is the same as the pure PMNT solution in water (yellow). It shows that the anions in the buffer have no influence on the conformational change of the conjugated backbone of the PMNT, meaning that the buffer used here do not contain any interferential anionic ions. Results from UV­vis detection validated the color changes with conformational conversion of DNA i-motif structure. They also showed that the conformational version occurred at pH 5.0­6.5 (Fig. 1B, UV­vis spectra of all control experiments can be found in Figs. S1­S3 in supplementary information). The results were also consistent with that of fluorescence detection (fluorescence spectra

of all control experiments can be found in Figs. S4­S6 in supplementary information). We investigated the concentration range and the sensitivity of the sensing method to verify its potential to being a simple method to detect colorimetrically the existence of i-motif. As shown in Fig. 1C, between 40 and 4000 nM i-motif DNA, the UV­vis absorbance changed significantly. The best linear fit was achieved at a concentration range of 40­2000 nM (R2 = 0.96) (Fig. 1C insert). The LOD is as low as 40 nM. Moreover, to achieve the correlation between our method and a conventional standard one, the pH-driven conformational conversion was verified by circular dichroism (CD). As shown in Fig. 1D, there were significant differences in the CD spectra of PMNT, PMNT/i-motif (pH 4.0) and PMNT/i-motif (pH 8.0). No CD optical activity was observed for PMNT only. From pH 4.0 to pH 8.0, the spectrum of PMNT/i-motif shifted about 16 nm. The result is also consistent with that of our colorimetric method. Multiple-cycle i-motif conformation conversions were also achieved by adjusting the pH of the system alternately and were detected with the PMNT sensing probe (Fig. 1E). Along with the change of pH values from 8.0 to 4.0, the random coils probe will form into i-motif structure with protonation of the C C+ base pairs. Accordingly, the color of the system changed to yellow after a minute, meaning the completion of a cycle. Then, the originally i-motif conformation would switch to random coil by turning the pH of the system in turn. The absorbance detection confirms the cycling conversion and is consistent with the color change (Fig. 1E). Although each individual strand in the extreme terminal part of human telomere may be prone to quadruplex formation (the C-rich strand fold into an i-motif whereas the G-rich strand may adopt a G-quadruplex conformation), mostly, human telomeric DNA composed of (TTAGGG/CCCTAA)n repeats would form a classical Watson­Crick double helix (Phan and Mergny, 2002). So it is more important to detect the conversion of the conformation in the case of duplex. The interconversion between i-motif and duplex has been studied with different sequences (Datta and Armitage, 2001; Deng and Braunlin, 1995; Hardin et al., 1992; Miura and Thomas, 1994; Rangan et al., 2001; Salazar et al., 1996). However, besides a recent report based on AuNPs, no other colorimetric method has been undertaken previously. Here we designed a modified scheme (Fig. 2A) to try to investigate the conversion of duplex to i-motif equilibrium under a variety of pH values solutions. Under acidic condition (pH below 6.5), the C-rich sequence adopt a fourstranded i-motif while its complementary G-rich sequence appears as a random-coil. As a result, the system consists of the yellow imotif/PMNT complex and red ss-DNA/PMNT complex and show an orange to red color. However, when pH value is larger than 6.5, the two complementary single-strand sequences form a helix and produce the only complex (duplex/PMNT) to show yellow color. Over a wide pH range, we studied the pH-induced conformational conversions between i-motif and duplex, using above 21nt human telomeric C-rich sequence and its complementary sequence (d[(GGG(TTAGG)3 ], G-rich sequence). As anticipated, the system showed red color at low pH and yellow color at high pH (Fig. 2B). We also carried out a reversible detection by adjusting the pH values alternately according to the design. As shown in Fig. 2C, when the solution was acidic, the system showed orange color because of the presence of i-motif structure. While the solution was alkaline, the color changed to yellow because of the formation of ss-DNA/PMNT complex. And we found that the reversibility was relatively consistent whether changing pH from 5.0 to 8.0 or from 8.0 to 5.0. The cycling conversion was also confirmed by fluorescence detection method (Fig. 2C), which is basically consistent with the result of visual detection.

4. Conclusion In summary, we developed a simple and rapid colorimetric sensing strategy to detect the existence and conformational conversion of DNA i-motif structures, using PMNT. The conversion can be completed only by modulating the pH value of the system. This detection procedure only needs several minutes and can be performed reversibly. The color changes based on the conversion of i-motif is just like a colorimetric "molecular switch". Compared with traditional methods based on large and heavy instruments, our method has advantages such as simple and rapid procedures, low cost and small volume of samples needed. It might have poten-
