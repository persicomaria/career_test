Introduction. Family 4 carbohydrate esterases (CEs) catalyse the N- or O-deacetylation of substrates such as acetylated xylan, chitin, and peptidoglycan. CEs are classified into 14 families by sequence homology (see http:// afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY1). Family 4 is by far the largest of the CE families, with over 1000 open reading frames. The structure of CE4 enzymes from a number of bacterial species have been solved, including the peptidoglycan deacetylases from Streptococcus pneumoniae2 and Bacillus subtilis,3 acetyl xylan esterases from Clostridium thermocellum and Streptomyces lividans,4 and an enzyme of unknown specificity from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB code 1Z7A). CE4 enzymes contain a conserved NodB homology domain, and adopt a distorted (a/b)8 barrel fold. Most of the structures contain a divalent ion in the active site that is necessary for enzyme activity2,4 and which is coordinated by highly conserved histidine and aspartate residues. Here we report the structure of a putative peptidoglycan deacetylase CE4, ORF AAP24453 (hereafter BaCE4), from Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Peptidoglycan deacetylases catalyse the N-deacetylation of N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid moieties of bacterial peptidoglycan in the cell wall. This allows degradation and remodeling of the bacterial cell wall, which prevents recognition by mammalian host enzymes and is therefore an extremely useful defense mechanism for bacteria.5 The closely related B. subtilis enzyme, PdaA, has been shown to deacetylate N-acetyl muramic acid residues from peptidoglycan in vitro,6 and deletion in vivo causes spore germination to fail, as the muramic d-lactam structure cannot be formed.7 It is likely that BaCE4 plays a similar role in vivo, and hence is important in the sporulation of B. anthracis. Examination of the genome sequence of B. anthracis has revealed the organism hosts 10 putative polysaccharide deacetylases, which are similarly likely to have roles in sporulation, spore germination, vegetative growth, and host≠microbe interactions.8 Inhibition of these enzymes is extremely attractive in the quest for preventing proliferation of these highly infectious organisms.

from Bacillus anthracis str. Ames genomic DNA with ligation independent cloning compatible ends. The PCR product was annealed into a modified ligation-independent cloning pET28a vector. This plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells and cultured in 0.5 L autoinduction media9 supplemented with 50 mg mL¿1 kanamycin, at 378C, for 8 h. Protein expression was induced overnight at 308C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7, 150 mM NaCl, and subsequently sonicated to lyse the cells. The supernatant was applied to a 5 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) where the protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient, and subsequently to a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column. Pure protein was buffer exchanged into 20 mM HEPES, pH 7, and concentrated to 40 mg/mL for crystallization. BaCE4 was crystallized from 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.2 M zinc acetate, and 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (Hampton screen I). Crystals were cryoprotected in the mother liquor solution with the addition of 25% glycerol and flash frozen. Data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K on ID14-3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, ∞ Grenoble, to 1.7 A resolution. Data were processed with HKL2000,10 and all subsequent computing used the CCP4 suite of programs.11 The BaCE4 structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe12 with the protein atoms of a monomer from PDB entry 1W1B. ∞ Data were used between 10 and 4 A, with an integration ∞ . There is a single molecule in the asymsphere of 25 A ∞ metric unit with a packing density of 2.6 A3 Da¿1 and solvent content of $52%. The structure was refined using iterative cycles of REFMAC13 and model building/ solvent addition with COOT14 (statistics are shown in Table I).

Results and Discussion. Data for BaCE4 crystals were ∞ collected to 1.7 A resolution, and the structure subsequently solved using molecular replacement methods with the B. subtilis enzyme PdaA, which has 56% sequence identity, as the search model. BaCE4 is shown to adopt a distorted (a/b)8 barrel fold [Fig. 1(A)], as observed with other CE4 enzymes, with the active site lying

in a groove. The majority of the 237-residue chain could be traced, but has loops missing between residues 13 and 22, and 174 and 187, and residues 236 and 237 at the Cterminus can also not be observed. Examination of the active site reveals a zinc ion coordinated to an acetate ion and a cacodylate ion [Fig. 1(B)], all of which have been sequestered from the crystallization mother liquor. Three other zinc ions and another acetate ion can also be observed in the electron density, which appear at crystal contacts and aid packing. The active site zinc ion coordinates five electronegative atoms with tetrahedral geometry. There is a bidentate, but asymmetric, interaction with both oxygen atoms of the acetate molecule; one of ∞ these interactions is at a distance of 2.5 A, which is longer than usually observed with zinc ion coordination.18 The nitrogen atoms of His103 and His107 coordinate the zinc ∞ ion at distances of 2.0 and 2.1 A, respectively, an oxygen ∞ atom of the cacodylate ion at a distance of 1.9 A and it is ∞ away from the other oxygen atom of the acetate ion. 2.2 A BaCE4 lacks an otherwise conserved aspartate residue, which coordinates the metal ion in other CE4 structures. In its place, BaCE4 possesses an asparagine residue which points away from the active site metal ion into the core of the protein. The bound acetate ion fills

the void left by this aspartate residue; the acetate overlaps with the carboxylate group of the aspartate residue observed in other structures and makes similar interactions with the metal ion. An asparagine residue is also seen in this sequence position in the closely related PdaA structure,3 and is also observed to point away from the active site. Alignments with a number of CE4 sequences indicate that although aspartate is common at this position, asparagine, as well as hydrophobic residues such as alanine and valine are also observed, and thus is not strictly necessary for a ``conserved metal ion binding triad'' as had been suggested by other alignments.2,19 The structural studies of CE4 enzymes with different residues at this position may provide information about substrate specificity (e.g., chitin vs. acetylated xylan vs. peptidoglycan). It is highly likely that BaCE4 deacetylates N-acetyl muramic acid and hence may utilize the extra space provided by the lack of an aspartate residue to bind the bulky group at the O3 position of the muramic acid. It has indeed been suggested that the carboxylate on the O-lactoyl group of the substrate may interact with the metal ion.2,3 This study supports the proposed acid/base catalytic mechanism for CE4 enzymes [Fig. 1(C)], which has been deduced by biochemical, structural, and mutagenesis data.2,4,20 Asp52 would act as a base to activate a water molecule, which would be stabilized by the zinc ion. The resulting hydroxide ion would act as a nucleophile to attack the acetate. This would be concomitant with leaving group departure, which may receive general acid assistance from His201. The reaction would pass through a tetrahedral geometry transition state. The binding of the cacodylate ion is positioned where the acetate attached to the sugar would bind during catalysis, but its tetrahedral geometry mimics that of the reaction transition state. Previous complexes with a sulphate ion (with similar tetrahedral geometry)2 and acetate have also been observed in this position on other systems.4 It is significant that the cacodylate ion rather than an acetate ion is bound here, and confirms that the transition state mimicking tetrahedral geometry has a higher affinity than the product-like acetate ion. It is interesting to note that in most CE4 structures, including those with acetate bound, the metal ion has octahedral coordination,2,4 despite tetrahedral coordination being more common for catalytic enzymes.20 However, it is interesting to note that in the sulphate complex with the S. pneumoniae enzyme,2 and in the cacodylate complex described here, which both mimic the geometry at the transition state, the metal ion has tetrahedral coordination. These differences in metal ion coordination may reflect changes that occur to the coordination during catalysis. The structure of BaCE4 highlights both similarities and important differences between related CE4 enzymes, which need further investigation with biochemical, mutagenesis, and structural studies in order to ascertain the requirements for substrate specificity. It seems apparent that the residues vital for catalysis, such as Asp52 and His201 in BaCE4, are highly conserved, whereas

those that bind the metal ion can tolerate a number of different residues other than the ``His-His-Asp'' triad that was once predicted. These enzymes play a vital role in bacteria cell wall maintenance, and the lack of such enzymes in humans could be exploited by the drug design process to inhibit their proliferation.
