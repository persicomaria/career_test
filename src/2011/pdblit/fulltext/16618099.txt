ABSTRACT: 4-Hydroxyphenylacetate (4-HPA) is oxidized as an energy source by two component enzymes, the large component (HpaB) and the small component (HpaC). HpaB is a 4-HPA monooxygenase that utilizes FADH2 supplied by a flavin reductase HpaC. We determined the crystal structure of HpaC (ST0723) from the aerobic thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7 in its three states [NAD(P)+-free, NAD+-bound, and NADP+-bound]. HpaC exists as a homodimer, and each monomer was found to contain an FMN. HpaC preferred FMN to FAD because there was not enough space to accommodate the AMP moiety of FAD in its flavin-binding site. The most striking difference between the NAD(P)+free and the NAD+/NADP+-bound structures was observed in the N-terminal helix. The N-terminal helices in the NAD+/NADP+-bound structures rotated ca. 20° relative to the NAD(P)+-free structure. The bound NAD+ has a compact folded conformation with nearly parallel stacking rings of nicotinamide and adenine. The nicotinamide of NAD+ stacked the isoalloxazine ring of FMN so that NADH could directly transfer hydride. The bound NADP+ also had a compact conformation but was bound in a reverse direction, which was not suitable for hydride transfer.

Reduced flavins play important roles as metabolic reaction mediators in a variety of biological processes, including bioluminescence (1, 2), activation of ribonucleotide reductase (3), degradation of aromatic compounds (4-7), synthesis of antibiotics (8-10), and fossil fuel degradation (11). Flavin reductases (FRs) catalyze the reduction of free flavin using NADH or NADPH. FRs can be classified into various subgroups according to their substrate specificities, amino acid sequences, and functional properties. The FRs that use NADH, NADPH, or both are referred to as FRD, FRP, and FRG, respectively (12, 13). In recent years, a new family of short-chain FRs has been reported (14-17), with these catalysts acting as small components of two-component monooxygenase systems (Figure 1). The small-component FRs supply reduced flavins to the large component monooxygenases. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetate (4-HPA)1 3-monooxygenase is such a two-component enzyme comprising HpaC and HpaB (17). HpaC is an NADH:flavin oxidoreductase that supplies FADH2 to HpaB,

while HpaB oxidizes 4-HPA to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (3,4-DHPA) using FADH2, which is the first step of the 4-HPA catabolic pathway (4, 18). 4-HPA is a typical fermented product of aromatic amino acids and some plant materials in animal intestinal tracts, and some bacteria utilize it as a source of carbon and energy (19). There is no apparent interaction between the HpaB and HpaC proteins (20). To understand the molecular mechanisms of flavin reduction by HpaC and coupled monooxygenation by the partner protein HpaB, we are investigating the structure and function of HpaC and HpaB two-component systems from Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7 (21), an aerobic thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon. Here we report the crystal structures of HpaC (ST0723) from S. tokodaii strain 7 in its three states, NAD(P)+-free, NAD+-bound, and NADP+-bound, and discuss the environments of FMN and NAD(P)+, the hydride transfer, the conformational changes caused by NAD(P)+ binding, and the substrate specificity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Purification. The gene (st0723) encoding the HpaC protein (ST0723) was amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of S. tokodaii strain 7 as the template. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the T7 expression vector pET-28a(+) (Novagen). The Escherichia coli strain Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen) was used as the host for protein expression. The cells were grown in LB media containing 30 µg/mL kanamycin at 310 K. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside) (Wako). After 12 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at

4500g and resuspended in Sol A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole). The cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 40000g for 30 min. The supernatant was heated at 353 K for 30 min and centrifuged at 40000g for 30 min. Then, 0.01% polyethylene imine (Wako) was added, and the resultant supernatant was stirred for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 40000g for 30 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column. The protein was eluted with Sol B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole). The purified protein solution was dialyzed against 20 mM Tricine, pH 8.5, at room temperature and concentrated to 2 mg/mL using an Apollo 20 mL concentrator (Orbital Biosciences). The protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (22) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the production of Se-Met-labeled protein, the same host strain was grown in minimal M9 medium supplemented with amino acids and selenomethionine. At an OD600 of 0.2, expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG (final concentration), and the cells were harvested after 12 h. Dithiothreitol (DTT, a final concentration of 5 mM) was added to all of the buffers except the buffers for the Ni-NTA purification. Crystallization and Data Collection. Crystallization was performed using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. Crystals of ST0723 (0.07 × 0.07 × 0.2 mm) were obtained in a day by mixing 1 µL of the protein solution and 1 µL of the reservoir solution containing 7.5% (v/v) 2-propanol and 1.4-1.7 M ammonium sulfate. A drop was equilibrated against 400 µL of the reservoir solution. The NAD(P)+ complex crystals were prepared by soaking the NAD(P)+-free crystal in the reservoir solution supplemented with 50-100 mM NAD(P)H for 15 min at room temperature. The bound flavin stayed reduced for at least 2 h at room temperature. The soaking experiments were performed under

aerobic conditions. Se-Met-labeled crystals were obtained under the same conditions as the NAD(P)+-free crystals. NAD(P)+ complex and Se-Met-labeled crystals were transferred to the reservoir solution containing 25% (v/v) glycerol as the cryoprotectant and flash-cooled at 100 K in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected in a nitrogen cryostream at beamline BL41XU of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) and at beamline PF5A of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). NAD(P)+-free crystals were mounted in a glass capillary, and X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature with an in-house R-AXIS VII (Rigaku, Japan). The diffraction data were indexed and scaled with HKL2000 (23). The NAD(P)+-free, NAD+ complex, NADP+ complex, and Se-Met-labeled crystals belonged to space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions a ) b ) 87.6 Å and c ) 49.6 Å, a ) b ) 86.4 Å and c ) 49.0 Å, a ) b ) 86.6 Å and c ) 49.1 Å, and a ) b ) 86.1 Å and c ) 49.3 Å, respectively. They contained one HpaC monomer per asymmetric unit according to the Matthews coefficient (24). The data statistics are given in Table 1. Structure Modeling and Refinement. The structure of HpaC was determined by the SAD method using the peak data (wavelength, 0.9790 Å). All of the five expected Se atoms in the asymmetric unit were found using the program SOLVE (25). The program RESOLVE (25) was used to improve phases. Automated model building was carried out with ARP/ wARP (26), and approximately 70% of the residues were built. The remainder were built manually with XtalView (27) and refined with REFMAC5 (28). The NAD(P)+-free structure was then determined by the molecular replacement program MOLREP (29) using the Se-Met structure as the initial model. Then, simulated annealing and B-factor refinements were performed using CNS (30), and further refinements were performed using XtalView and REFMAC5.

Water molecules were added using ARP/wARP. The final model consisted of all of the residues except Lys92, Asn139, Ser155, and Leu156 as well as 18 waters and 1 FMN. Lys92 and Asn139 were refined as Ala because of the lack of their side-chain electron densities. There was no density for the last two residues (Ser155 and Leu156). The NAD+ and NADP+ complex structures were solved by molecular replacement using the NAD(P)+-free structure as the initial model. There were very clear densities for NAD+ and NADP+, respectively. The final NAD+-bound model was composed of 1-155 residues, 84 waters, 1 reduced FMN, and 1 NAD+, while the final NADP+-bound model was composed of 1-156 residues, 56 waters, 1 reduced FMN, and 1 NADP+. Lys92, Asn139, and Leu156 were refined as Ala. The qualities of the models were checked by PROCHECK (31). The refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. FlaVin Reductase Assays. Flavin reductase assays were performed in a reaction mixture containing 0.2 µg/mL protein, 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 200 µM NADH or NADPH, and 30 µM FMN, FAD, or riboflavin. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance of NAD(P)H at 340 nm ( 340 ) 6.22 mM-1 cm-1). The reaction was initiated by adding NAD(P)H. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OVerall Structure. HpaC from S. tokodaii strain 7 consists of 156 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 17965. The crystal structures of HpaC in its three states [NAD(P)+-free, NAD+-bound, and NADP+-bound] were solved at 2.30, 1.70, and 2.05 Å, respectively (Figure 2). The quality of the three structures was assessed by a Ramachandran plot, and no residue in the three structures fell in the generously allowed and disallowed regions. The

secondary structure of each monomer was composed of twelve -strands, three R-helices, and two 310 helices, which formed a seven-stranded -barrel with a capping R2 helix flanked by the remaining helices and strands. In all three states, HpaC existed as a homodimer (2 × 18 kDa) in the crystal with approximate dimensions of 60 × 40 × 40 Å3. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be ca. 30000 by gel filtration (data not shown), indicating that it also existed as a homodimer in solution. The two subunits of the homodimer were related by a molecular 2-fold axis. The dimer interface was stabilized by the interactions of the residues located at the R1 helix and 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12 strands. The three structures were very similar to one another with the following pairwise RMSDs (root mean square deviations) for CR atoms of residues 1-154: 0.93 Å between the NAD(P)+-free and NAD+-bound struc-

A structural similarity search using DALI (32) revealed that HpaC was similar to the following proteins: the styrene monooxygenase small component from Thermus thermophilus (19% identical in amino acid sequence; PDB code 1USC; not published) with an RMSD of 2.2 Å for 152 CR, PheA2 from Bacillus thermoglucosidasius A7 (27% identical; 1RZ0) (33) with an RMSD of 2.2 Å for 144 CR, ferric reductase (FeR) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (25% identical; 1I0R) (34) with an RMSD of 2.4 Å for 146 CR, a flavoprotein from T. thermophilus (22% identical; 1WGB; not published) with an RMSD of 2.1 Å for 144 CR, and FMN-binding protein from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (16% identical; 1EJE) (35) with an RMSD of 2.5 Å for 153 CR. The structural comparison of these proteins revealed that the residues on the C-terminal -sheet, the loop between R3 and 1 helices, and the successive 1 helix contributed to the flavin and NAD(P)H specificities, which will be discussed in detail in the following sections. Comparison of FMN Binding Sites. The HpaC crystals were yellow, and the electron density map clearly showed that each HpaC subunit tightly bound an FMN. The FMN was located in a pocket near the dimer interface and surrounded by 3, 5, and 11 strands and R2, R3, and 1 helices. The si face of the isoalloxazine ring was buried, while the re face was completely exposed to the substrates' binding site. The bound FMN was stabilized by 11 hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Figure 3). The 2,4pyrimidinedione moiety of the isoalloxazine ring formed hydrogen bonds with the main-chain atoms of the 5 strand (Phe48 and Asp50) and the side-chain atoms of Thr34 and Asn55. The N5 atom was hydrogen-bonded with the amide nitrogen atom of Asn33. The dimethylbenzene portion of the isoalloxazine ring formed hydrophobic contacts with the enzyme. The ribityl chain of FMN was hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain atoms of Thr31 and Phe79, the N atom of Asn55, and the N1 and N2 atoms of Arg87. It is likely that the bound FMN is a cofactor because it is tightly bound to the enzyme. Phe79 interacting with the FMN was conserved in the homologous proteins, but many other contact residues were not conserved (Figure 1). There were some water molecules at the NAD(P)H binding pocket in the absence of NAD(P)+, and one water molecule was located above the isoalloxazine ring of the oxidized FMN. HpaC was found to be most similar to PheA2 (1RZ0) (33) of the same short-chain flavin reductase family, but these proteins contained different kinds of flavins, FMN vs FAD. Superimposition of the structures of HpaC and PheA2 revealed that the loop between R3 and 1 helices and the successive 1 helix in HpaC were closer to the bound flavin than those in PheA2. The main chain of Pro83 and Val84 and the side chain of Arg87 caused a steric hindrance to FAD binding so that there was not enough space to accommodate the AMP moiety of FAD in HpaC. Thus, HpaC preferred FMN to FAD. Comparison of NAD+ and NADP+ Binding Sites. The HpaC crystals were bleached by adding excess amounts of NADH or NADPH, which indicated that HpaC was capable of receiving the hydride from NAD(P)H and of reducing the bound FMN. NAD+ was bound in a cleft formed between

FMN, the N-terminal R1 helix, the 1, 5, 11, and 12 strands, and the 4 strand of the other subunit. The bound NAD+ was hydrogen-bonded with six amino acid residues and several water molecules (Figure 4C). The NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) moiety of NAD+ was hydrogenbonded to N of Lys53, N of His123, which was strictly conserved and essential to NAD binding (36), O of Tyr145, and N of Arg148. The 5-phosphate of AMP was hydrogenbonded with N of Arg10 and N of Arg148. The adenosine moiety was hydrogen-bonded with O of Ser37 in the other subunit. The nicotinamide was parallel to the isoalloxazine ring of FMN, and the distance between the C4 atom of the nicotinamide and the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring was 3.4 Å, which was close enough for hydride transfer to occur. The bound NAD+ was in a compact folded conformation (Figure 4A) with nearly parallel stacking of the nicotinamide and adenine rings, which was very similar to the conformation of NAD+ bound to PheA2 (33). The distance between the adenine C6 and the nicotinamide C2 atoms was only 4.2 Å, indicative of the compactness of the NAD(P)+ conformation (37). This conformation is one of the most compact observed to date for NAD(P)+ (38). The conformation of NAD+ bound to HpaC was different from the conformation of NADP+ bound to a homologous protein FeR (34). The NADP+ in FeR adopted an extended conformation, and the adenine ring was located between the 310- and the C-terminal R3 helices. However, the C-terminal region in HpaC forms a -sheet, and the adenine ring of NAD+ was located between the N-terminal residues and the nicotinamide

ring. The bound FMN is in the oxidized form in the NAD(P)+-free structure, while it is in the reduced form in the NAD(P)+ complex structures. The isoalloxazine rings of both the oxidized and reduced FMN were planar, and no conformational changes were observed. We succeeded in solving the structures of the cryocooled NAD+/NADP+ complex HpaC, but we failed to refine the structure of the cryocooled NAD(P)+-free HpaC with final Rcryst ) 27% and Rfree ) 33%. Thus, we collected the dataset of the NAD(P)+-free HpaC at room temperature using glass capillaries. A CR superimposition of the three structures is shown in Figure 5. The NAD(P)+-free structure (at room temperature) was very similar to the NAD+/NADP+ complex structures (under cryocooled conditions), with the most obvious difference being seen at the N-terminal helix. The N-terminal helices of the NAD+/NADP+ complex structures were tilted ca. 20° relative to that of the NAD(P)+-free structure. Such a conformational change may have occurred due to cryofreezing or by NAD(P)H binding in order to retain the bound NAD(P)H until the hydride transfer occurred from NAD(P)H to FMN. Although HpaC is an NADH-dependent flavin reductase, the crystal structure of the NADP+-bound HpaC was also solved by soaking the crystal in an excess amount of NADPH. The bound NADP+ adopted a compact folded conformation in which the adenine ring and the nicotinamide ring were stacked (Figure 4B). Unlike NAD+, however, NADP+ bound upside down in the catalytic pocket. In the NAD+-bound structure, the distance between the C4 atom of the nicotinamide and the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring was 3.4 Å, while in the NADP+-bound structure, the adenine ring lay between the isoalloxazine ring of FMN and

the nicotinamide ring of NADP+, and the distance was 7.8 Å, which was too long for direct hydride transfer to occur. In the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR), a Tyr residue stacking with FAD must move when the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ interacts with the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (39), but such a movement cannot occur in the NADP+-bound structure of HpaC because the adenine moiety is sandwiched between the nicotinamide ring and the isoalloxazine ring. NADP+ interacts with the same residues as NAD+ (Figure 4D). The adenine moiety was found to be hydrogen-bonded with the side chain of His123. The 2-phosphate was hydrogen-bonded to N of Lys53. The pyrophosphate was hydrogen-bonded with the side chains of Tyr145, Arg148, and Arg10. The nicotinamide interacted with the side chain of Ser37 of the other subunit. The NAD+-bound and NADP+-bound structures were found to be almost identical to each other, with an RMSD of 0.15 Å for CR atoms of residues 1-154. In the NAD+/NADP+-bound structures, the residues interacting with NAD(P)+ were located at the same position, meaning that HpaC does not distinguish between the adenine moiety and the nicotinamide moiety of NAD(P)H. Substrate Specificity. We measured the flavin reductase activity of HpaC to examine its substrate specificity. The reductase activity depended on added NADH or NADPH. As shown in Table 2, HpaC preferred NADH to NADPH as a substrate (NADPH was only 5.4% effective when compared with NADH). On the other hand, FMN was the best substrate among the three flavin compounds. FAD and riboflavin were 65.7% and 40.1% effective, respectively, when compared with FMN. The NAD(P)+-bound structures of HpaC provide a clue to the NADH dependency of HpaC. In the NAD+-bound structure, the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+ stacks the isoalloxazine ring of FMN, whereas in the NADP+-bound structure, NADP+ binds in a reverse direction and the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+ lies far (7.8 Å) away from the isoalloxazine ring of FMN. If NADP+ could bind in the same fashion as NAD+, the 2-phosphate of NADP+ would be buried inside the pocket and surrounded by the side chains of Met9, Leu14, Asn33, Asn36, and Ser37 of the other subunit. Thus, there would be no positive charged residue in this hypothetical 2-phosphate binding region. It is known that the positively charged residues, such as lysine, arginine, and histidine, play important roles in recognizing the 2-phosphate of NADPH in NADPH-specific enzymes (40, 41). In the NADP+-bound structure of HpaC, two positively charged residues, Lys6 and Lys53, are positioned at the entrance of the NAD(P)H binding pocket, and these positive charges likely contribute to the reverse mode of binding of NADP+. Lys53 is not conserved in the short-chain flavin reductase family, while Lys6 is conserved as positively charged Arg or Lys (Figure 1).

Short-Chain Flavin Reductase HpaC The specific activity of NADPH-bound HpaC was found to be more than 1 order of magnitude lower than that of NADH-bound HpaC. There are two possibilities regarding the inefficient hydride transfer from NADPH to FMN: (1) a hydride transfers in a long way from the C4 atom of the nicotinamide to the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring; (2) a hydride transfers from the small portion of NADP+ that would bind to HpaC, just like NAD+ to FMN. In the NADP+-bound structure of putative StyB (1USF), the 2phosphate of the bound NADP+ was found to be located inside the NAD(P)H binding pocket. Although there is no evidence for multiple conformations of NADP+ bound to HpaC, it is possible that a small portion of NADP+ could bind HpaC in the same manner as NAD+. In summary, we have determined the crystal structure of the short-chain flavin reductase HpaC in its three states [NAD(P)+-free, NAD+-bound, and NADP+-bound]. The structures indicate that (1) HpaC prefers FMN to FAD because of the insufficient space for accommodating the AMP moiety of FAD, (2) NADH and NADPH bind HpaC in the same place but in a reverse direction, and (3) HpaC prefers NADH to NADPH for efficient hydride transfer. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Synchrotron radiation experiments were done at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) (Proposal 2003A0565-NL1-np) and at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) (Proposal 03S2-002). We thank Dr. Ohshima (University of Tokushima) for providing us with S. tokodaii strain 7 cells. REFERENCES
