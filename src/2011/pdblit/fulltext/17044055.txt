ABSTRACT The testis- and skeletal-musclespecific dual-specificity phosphatase (TMDP) is a member of the dual-specificity phosphatase (DSP) subgroup of protein tyrosine phosphatases. TMDP has similar activities toward both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylated substrates, and is supposed to be involved in spermatogenesis. Here, we report the crystal structure of human TMDP at a re° solution of 2.4 A. In spite of high sequence similarity with other DSPs, the crystal structure of TMDP shows distinct structural motifs and surface properties. In TMDP, the a1­b1 loop, a substrate recognition motif is located further away from the active site loop in comparison to prototype DSP Vaccinia H1 related phophatase (VHR), which preferentially dephosphorylates tyrosine phosphorylated substrates and down-regulates MAP kinase signaling. Residues in the active site residues of TMDP are smaller in size and more hydrophobic than those of VHR. In addition, TMDP cannot be aligned with VHR in loop b3­a4. These differences in the active site of TMDP result in a flat and wide pocket structure, allowing equal binding of phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine substrates. Proteins 2007; C 66:239­245.

Key words: TMDP; crystal structure; dual-specificity phosphatase INTRODUCTION The dual-specificity protein phosphatases (DSPs) catalyze dephosphorylation of protein substrates at both tyrosine and threonine residues, and play crucial regulatory roles in cellular signal transduction mediating cell growth, differentiation, transcription, and apoptosis in multicellular organisms.1­3 Of these DSPs, the subgroup of typical MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) has a catalytic domain and an additional MAP kinase binding (MKB) domain. The catalytic domain of MKPs removes phospho-groups from MAP kinases at their dually phosphorylated pT-X-pY motif (pT, phospho-threonine; X, any amino acid; pY, phospho-tyrosine), resulting in the inacC V 2006 WILEY-LISS, INC.

tivation of MAP kinases. The MKB domain is known to contribute to substrate binding and specificity.4 Another subgroup of DSPs is distinct from the typical DSPs in that they lack the MKB domain, resulting in smaller enzymes. These enzymes are called atypical DSPs and 19 members of atypical DSPs are known in the human genome.5 All of the catalytic domains of DSPs contain the signature motif HCXXGXXR and a conserved aspartate residue. To date, two atomic structures of the catalytic domain from the typical MKPs, MKP36 and PAC1,7 and one from the atypical DSPs, the Vaccinia H1 related phosphatase (VHR), have been solved.8 The catalytic domains from MKP3 and PAC1 were found to contain the disordered active site, suggesting that their activity may be induced by substrate binding. VHR represents a prototype of atypical DSPs because it is well characterized structurally and biologically. Despite the lack of the MKB domain, VHR forms a complex with activated MAP kinases, and downregulates the MAP kinase signaling.9,10 VHR has a relatively deep active site pocket that is easily accessible only by pY and prefers pY to pT in the dephosphorylation reactions.8 TMDP (testis- and skeletal-muscle-specific DSP) is closely related to VHR with sequence identity of about 45% and it also does not have the MKB domain.11 Despite the high degree of similarity between VHR and TMDP, they appear to fulfill different biological functions. TMDP mRNA appears when meiosis begins and is localized in spermatocytes, suggesting that TMDP is

involved in spermatogenesis.11,12 Recently, the gene encoding TMDP was found to be located on human chromosome 10q22.2 and an alternative ORF produces a novel DSP, muscle-restricted dual specificity phosphatase (MDSP), that is specific to postnatal skeletal muscle.13 Recombinant TMDP is shown to exhibit similar specific activities toward both pY and pT of myelin basic protein.11 Approaches to structural information are very important to understand how DSPs recognize their substrates, because there are few reports of DSPs that have similar activities toward pY and pT. Here, we report the crystal structure of human TMDP at a resolution of ° 2.4 A. This structure provides detailed information on distinct structural motifs and surface properties when compared with those of VHR and other DSPs METHODS Expression and Purification The TMDP full-length gene was amplified by PCR using human testis cDNA (Clontech). The amplified PCR product was digested with Nde I and Bam HI, and was subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pET28a(þ) vector (Novagen), resulting in an N-terminal His-tagged protein. The plasmid containing TMDP gene (residues 1­ 198) was introduced into the BL21 (DE3) E.coli strain. Cells were grown at 188C and protein expression was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for 16 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 0.04% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. After cell lysis by sonication, the Histagged TMDP protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography. The His-tag was removed from the protein by thrombin digestion and the protein was further purified by CM-sepharose ion exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia). The purified protein was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 0.1M NaCl, and 10 mM DTT and was concentrated to 8 mg mLÀ1 for use in crystallization. Each purification step was verified by SDS-PAGE and the concentration of the protein was determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Crystallization and Data Collection Crystallization was performed at 188C using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Initial trials were carried out by using commercial screening kits (Hampton Research). The best crystals were grown by mixing 1.8 lL protein (8 mg mLÀ1) solution and an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 1.5M sodium chloride, 10% (v/v) ethanol, and 10 mM DTT. After 1 week incubation, TMDP crystals grew to their full size. The crystal in the droplet was transferred to a cryo solution containing the mother liquor supplemented with 20% (v/ v) glycerol for 1 min and flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas ° stream at À1808C. The crystal diffracted to 2.4 A resolution and belonged to the space group P21 with unit cell ° ° ° parameters of a ¼ 61.59 A, b ¼ 72.24 A, c ¼ 89.90 A, a ¼ g ¼ 908, b ¼ 99.78.

The diffraction data were processed and scaled with the program Mosflm14 and Scala.15 The statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in Table I. Structure Solution and Refinement The structure of TMDP was determined by the molecular replacement method, using the VHR structure (PDB code: 1VHR) as a search model.8 The program EPMR16 placed four monomers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. Refinement was carried out using the CNS program.17 5% of data, randomly selected, were set aside for the Rfree calculation. Refinement included an overall anisotropic B factor and bulk solvent correction. The NCS restraints were applied at an initial stage of refinement. Rounds of refinements were performed with manual rebuildings using the O program.18 The Rcryst and Rfree values were 19.8 and 25.0%, respectively. The Ramachandran plot drawn by the PROCHECK program19 showed that 87.3 and 12.7% of all residues fell within the most favored and additionally favored regions,

respectively. There are no residues in the additionally allowed or disallowed regions. The final model included residues 25À193 of monomer A and monomer B, residues 25­198 of monomer C and monomer D, and 260 water molecules. Figures were drawn by the programs RIBBONS,20 GRASP,21 Bobscript,22 and Molscript.23 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The structure of TMDP was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of VHR as a search model. The four molecules (molecules A, B, C, and D) in the asymmetric unit are nearly in identical conformation. These four molecules form two potential dimers (A:B and C:D) whose monomers are related by the same noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry. The two dimers have essentially the same dimeric contacts having the interface of ° 841 A2 that corresponds to 9.8% of the total surface area of the monomer. However, the dimeric contacts are not significant enough to hold the two molecules in solution. The gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering experiments indicated that TMDP exists as a monomer in solution (data not shown). TMDP (25­198) is found to be folded into a compact and globular molecule ° with approximate dimensions of 40 3 35 3 30 A3. The TMDP structure contains a central twisted five-stranded b sheet (b1­b5) surrounded by eight a helices (a1­a8) [Fig. 1(a)]. The 2Fo­Fc electron density map around the active site is shown in [Fig. 1(b)]. In a search for homologous structures by using the Dali server,24 VHR was identified as the most similar enzyme with z-value of 27.7.8 Besides VHR, MKP36 and PTEN25 were identified with z-values ranging from 16 to 13. When we aligned the structure of TMDP with that of VHR, 164 Ca atoms could be superimposed with a root mean square ° deviation of 1.0 A. In spite of good alignments in the overall structure, TMDP has a more planar protein surface around the active site. One of the most prominent differences is the conformation of loop a1­b1 [Fig. 1(c)]. The a1­b1 loop together with helix a1 is known as substrate recognition region in VHR and has been found to be missing in typical DSPs such as MKP3 and PAC1 (Fig. 2).8 Residues in loop a1­b1 exhibit low sequence homology between TMDP and VHR when compared with other regions of the protein. The a1­b1 loop of VHR comes in close contact with the active site loop, while the corresponding loop of TMDP is found to be placed further away from the active site loop resulting in a broadened active site pocket in TMDP (Fig. 3). Another region that cannot be aligned with VHR is found in loop b3­a4. This region is a part of the segment called the variable insert and is remarkably shorter in typical MKPs such as MKP3 and PAC-1.6,8 Structurebased alignment shows that two residues (Phe 68 and Met 69) in loop b3­a4 of VHR are absent in TMDP (Fig. 2). The loop b3­a4 of VHR protrudes above the protein surface [Figs. 3(a,b)] and the main chain carbonyl of Met 69 forms a hydrogen bond with the active site Arg 130.8 In TMDP, the side chain of Gln 84 makes

a hydrogen bond with that of Arg 144, thus stabilizing loop b3­a4. The shortened b3­a4 loop of TMDP forms a relatively planar protein surface. Unlike VHR, in which the protruding loop b3­a4 and the active site proximal loop a1­b1 form a deep and narrow pocket, TMDP contains a wide and shallow pocket [Fig. 3(b,c)]. Thus, the active site pocket volume of TMDP seems to be adequate for accommodation of both pY and pT. The catalytically important residues of TMDP exhibit similar conformations to those found in VHR and other DSPs [Fig. 3(a)]. The signature motif HCX1X2GX3X4R containing Cys 138 and Arg 144 is located in loop b5­a6. Amide atoms of the main chain in the active site loop b5­ a6 and guanidine group from Arg 144 face toward the inside of the active site loop, so that they are able to form partial charge interactions with the sulfhydryl group of the catalytic Cys 138. The general acid Asp 106 of TMDP occupies a similar position of Asp 92 in the b4­a5 loop of VHR. Although catalytically important residues in TMDP are well aligned with those of VHR, sequence conservation of residues near the active site is quite low. Residues in the active site loop of TMDP (Ala 139-Met 140-Gly 141-Val 142-Ser 143) are more hydrophobic than those of VHR (Arg 125-Glu 126-Gly 127-Tyr 128-Ser 129). The side chains of Glu 126 and Tyr 128 at position X2 and X4 within the active site loop of VHR make the entrance to the active site narrow and so restrict the access of pT, thus explaining why VHR has a strong preference for pY.29 In contrast to VHR, TMDP contains the smaller Val 142 at position X3 [Fig. 3(a)]. The side chain of Val 142 points outside of the active site loop and forms hydrophobic interaction with Leu 43 of loop a1­b1. As a result, the entrance to the active site of TMDP is found to be much wider than that of VHR (Fig. 3). Additionally, Ala 139 of TMDP at position X1, which corresponds to Arg 125 of VHR, is shown to constitute a swallow pocket [Fig. 3(b)]. The main chain of Val 142 is engaged in a hydrogen bonding interaction with Asn 177 (O in Val142--N in ° Cys175, 2.8 A) and the side chain of Ser 143 similarly ° does with Asn 177 (OG in S143--N in Asn177, 3.1 A), stabilizing the active site loop. TMDP also has a second phospho-binding site in a similar position to the pT binding site of VHR. In the structure of VHR complexed with bisphosphorylated peptide (PDB code:1J4X), the phosphorylated threonine is positioned into the positively charged pocket formed by Arg 158 and the side chain of Asn 41 from helix a2 also forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the phosphorylated moiety. When we superimpose TMDP's structure onto that of VHR, a similar positive charged pocket is created by Arg 172. However, Asp 57 in TMDP, which is equivalent to Asn 41 in VHR, is not quite likely to interact with the phosphate moiety because of charge repulsion. Furthermore, the side chain of Asp 57 in TMDP is directed away from the positive pocket. Instead, the side chain of His 45 in the a1­b1 loop is in proximity and points toward the expected phosphorylated moiety, suggesting that His 45 in TMDP may play a role in stabilizing phosphorylated substrate binding at the second site.

Fig. 2. Sequence alignment of TMDP and related DSPs. Sequences of four structurally elucidated human DSPs (TMDP, VHR, MKP3, and PAC-1) are aligned using the program CLUSTALW.26 Secondary structural elements of TMDP are indicated above the aligned sequences. Residues with 100% identity are orange and those with a conservation value above 6.0 defined in the program ALSCRIPT27 are yellow. The catalytically indispensable residues are indicated as inverted triangles.

As for the catalytic activation, MKPs interact with protein substrates through the MKB and catalytic domains, and are activated by substrate binding to the domains.4,30 In comparison, TMDP is sufficiently active in the substrate-free state.11 Besides, TMDP can dephosphorylate both pY and pT substrates with similar efficiency, which is a novel feature of TMDP catalysis.11 We compared a substrate-free TMDP structure with that of VHR complexed with phosphorylated peptide. There is still the possibility that substrate binding could induce the inward movement of the loop a1­b1 in TMDP resulting in a similar conformation to VHR. However, the protein­peptide interaction has little effect on the conformation of the loop a1­b1 in VHR.29 The residues in the loop a1­b1 of TMDP are engaged in the extensive interactions with those from the catalytic domain. There are

also no reports so far concerning noticeable conformational changes in the loop a1­b1 of the other DSPs. It is unlikely that the loop a1­b1 of TMDP undergoes conformational change upon substrate binding. Despite relatively low sequence homology between DSPs and protein tyrosine specific phophatases (PTPs), DSPs have similar structures to PTPs. PTP1B is a representative of classical PTP and is exclusively specific for phospho-tyrosine. In PTP1B, the loop a1­b1 is long and forms the edge of the deep active pocket, compared with VHR (Fig. 3).8,31,32 In TMDP, the loop a1­b1 consists of a wider and more planar active pocket than VHR, which prefers phospho-tyrosine to phospho-serine/ threonine. This suggests that the conformation of the loop a1­b1 in TMDP's structure is inherent and plays a crucial role in establishing the activity of TMDP toward
