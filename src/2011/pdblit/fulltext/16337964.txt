Conformational toggle triggers a modulator of RNA polymerase activity

Members of a recently discovered class of transcription factor, which includes the Gre factors that stimulate transcript cleavage, function by directly modulating the catalytic properties of RNA polymerase (RNAP). Now, three research groups have determined crystal structures of a Gre homolog, Gfh1, which inhibits all RNAP catalytic activities. Strikingly, these structures reveal a puzzling discrepancy between the Gfh1 and GreA conformations, but the discovery that a pH-dependent conformational toggle alters Gfh1 activity suggests an elegant solution. Multisubunit RNA polymerases The determination of high-resolution crystal structures of bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) [1­3] has revolutionized the understanding of transcription and its regulation. The core enzyme of the bacterial RNAP (subunit composition a2bb0 v) contains all of the catalytic machinery required for the synthesis of RNA from nucleotides. This core enzyme combines with a s factor to form the holoenzyme, which is then competent for promoter-specific transcription initiation. Overall, the core enzyme ­ which is conserved in sequence, structure and function from bacteria to man ­ adopts a structure reminiscent of a crab claw (Figure 1a). The large b and b0 subunits comprise the bulk of the 380-kDa RNAP molecular mass and encompass the main channel of the enzyme. This channel accommodates the DNA template, the RNA­DNA hybrid that forms during transcription and houses the active center of the enzyme, which is marked by a stably bound catalytic Mg2+ ion. Substrate nucleotides are thought to reach the site of catalysis via the secondary channel, which also links the external milieu to the active center [4] (Figure 1a). Recently, a new class of regulator has been described that binds to RNAP and modulates its catalytic activities by extending a coiled-coil motif directly into the secondary channel [5]. Now, three independent groups have reported the structure of one such regulator, Gfh1, from the Thermus genus [6­8]. Interestingly, Gfh1 can adopt (at least

in vitro) an active and an inactive conformation, and it is thought that low pH triggers the switch to the active conformation [7]. In vivo, conformational switching could provide another level of regulation in the pathways that control RNAP activity via secondary channel regulators. Secondary channel regulators During transcription, RNAP does not move exclusively in the forward direction, but occasionally backtracks on the DNA template. During this back-tracking, the catalytic center slides back relative to the 30 end of the transcript, and the 30 tail of the transcript gets displaced into the secondary channel [9]. For transcription to resume, either RNAP must forward-translocate or an endonucleolytic cleavage event must generate a new RNA 30 -OH that is correctly positioned for nucleotide addition at the active site of the enzyme [9]. This endonucleolytic cleavage reaction is catalyzed by the RNAP active site but is usually inefficient. The presence of the Escherichia coli GreA and GreB factors greatly enhances the reaction [9,10] and structural and biochemical studies have revealed how this occurs [11­14]. Gre factors contain a C-terminal globular domain that binds to the entrance of the secondary channel and an N-terminal anti-parallel coiled-coil domain that extends into the channel (Figure 1b). All the catalytic activities of RNAP (including nucleotide addition, nucleotide removal by either pyrophosphorolysis or exonucleolytic cleavage and endonucleolytic cleavage) proceed by a two-metal-ion mechanism [15,16]. One Mg2+ ion (MgI) is tightly bound within the RNAP active center but the second (MgII) requires additional stabilization, usually provided by the phosphates of the incoming nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) during nucleotide addition. The endonucleolytic cleavage reaction also requires MgI and MgII, and a pair of conserved acidic residues located at the tip of the Gre-factor coiled-coil domain helps stabilize the binding of MgII [10­13]. DksA is another transcription factor that extends a coiled-coil domain into the secondary channel with consequences for intrinsic RNAP activity [17­19]. However, DksA is not a transcript cleavage factor but, instead, destabilizes promoter open complexes [17,19]. In

conjunction with the stringent response effector ppGpp, this can lead to both positive and negative effects on transcription in vivo [17,19,20]. In this case, a pair of conserved acidic residues at the tip of the DksA coiled coil has been proposed to stabilize the binding of ppGpp near the active center [18], although this remains to be proven. Presumably, the existence of multiple secondary-channel regulators means competition for binding to the secondary channel. This competition will be governed not only by the relative concentrations of the regulators, but also by their relative binding affinities for the secondary channel. The finding that Gfh1 can adopt either an active or an inactive conformation identifies another variable that could influence this competition. Gfh1 ­ a GreA homolog that adopts alternative conformations Gfh1 was identified as one of two Gre family members in bacteria of the Thermus genus [21,22]. Both Thermus thermophilus and Thermus aquaticus contain a GreA homolog that functions similarly to E. coli GreA to stimulate transcript cleavage. By contrast, Gfh1, which inserts its coiled-coil domain into the secondary channel and competes with GreA for binding to RNAP, inhibits all catalytic activities of RNAP (at least in vitro) [7,8]. Although the data are complex, a plausible mechanism for the inhibitory action of Gfh1 is that it competes with incoming substrate NTP (or pyrophosphate) for the coordination of MgII [7]. Moreover, the physical presence of Gfh1 within the secondary channel might impede the passage of substrates and abortive products in and out of the active center (see Ref. [7] and references therein). Three research groups have now determined high-resolution crystal structures of Gfh1 and, although all the structures confirmed the resemblance between Gfh1 and E. coli GreA, they revealed a strikingly different relative

orientation of the N- and C-terminal domains [6­8]. When the structures are aligned by the C-terminal globular domains, the position of the N-terminal coiled-coil domain is flipped by 1708, making it difficult to envision how Gfh1 might bind to RNAP and appropriately present the acidic residues at the tip of its coiled coil to the active center (Figure 1b). The observation in vitro that the binding of Gfh1 to RNAP and its inhibitory activity decrease with increasing pH (in the range pH 6.5 to 7.5) [7] suggested that Gfh1 activity might be regulated through a pH-induced conformational toggle, with the crystal structures having captured the inactive conformation. To investigate whether Gfh1 could adopt a `GreA-like' conformation, Laptenko et al. [7] performed structural modeling and purified Gfh1 mutants bearing paired cysteine substitutions that were predicted to enable an intramolecular disulfide bond to lock Gfh1 into either the GreA-like or the `flipped' conformation. The formation of the locked structures under oxidizing conditions revealed that Gfh1 is competent to bind to RNAP and exert its inhibitory activities only in the GreA-like conformation. Perhaps, then, Gfh1 activity is regulated in vivo by conditions or factors that influence the equilibrium between the two conformations. A similar conformational switch might also modulate the activities of the other Gre factors. Structural modeling suggests that GreA could adopt the inactive conformation seen in the Gfh1 crystal structures [6­8]. Indeed, in vitro assays with an E. coli GreA double cysteine mutant locked in this flipped conformation demonstrated the loss of transcript cleavage activity. However, unlike that of Gfh1, the activity of GreA does not seem to be pH-dependent [7]. Using a lacZ reporter system Laptenko et al. [7] confirmed the inhibitory effect of Gfh1 on transcription in T. thermophilus, which was detectable only in the absence of greA. This suggests that GreA suppresses the Gfh1

inhibitory activity. Considering that the intracellular concentrations of GreA and Gfh1 are similar [7], and that in vitro measurements indicate that the affinity of Gfh1 for RNAP is approximately eightfold higher than that of GreA [22], Gfh1 might be held largely in the flipped (inactive) confirmation in vivo. Changes in intracellular pH might toggle Gfh1 into the GreA-like (active) conformation. However, technical constraints precluded an analysis of the pH dependence of Gfh1-mediated transcription inhibition in vivo. Can the functional divergence between GreA and Gfh1 be explained in structural terms? Inspection of the structures indicates several possibilities [6­8], which were, however, excluded by construction of a series of Gfh1­GreA hybrids [7]. Although replacement of the distal half of the Gfh1 N-terminal domain (Figure 1b) with the corresponding part of GreA resulted in a hybrid protein with GreA activity, the specific amino acid differences that dictate function (either GreA-like or Gfh1-like) remain to be identified. Concluding remarks The discovery that the activities of Gfh1 and GreA can potentially be regulated allosterically indicates that these might be more versatile regulators than previously suspected, perhaps responding to the same or different environmental stressors in vivo. Questions about Gfh1 that remain to be addressed include how changes in pH dictate the balance of Gfh1 conformations, whether or not pH is a relevant variable in vivo, and what are the physiologically relevant activities of Gfh1 under different growth conditions. More broadly, much remains to be elucidated about the roles of secondary-channel regulators, including whether or not they can have functionally overlapping roles and to what extent they compete for access to the secondary channel [23]. In addition, although it is clear that secondary-channel regulators can directly affect the expression of specific genes [19,20,24,25], those so far identified probably represent a small subset. Finally, a thorough mechanistic understanding of these different regulators, including identification of the specific steps of the transcription cycle (and specific kinetic intermediates) they affect, awaits further experimentation. Because different transcription units can be differentially affected by factors that target different steps and intermediates, such an analysis is essential for understanding the basis for transcript-specific effects of secondary-channel regulators.
