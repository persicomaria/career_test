Abstract The hydration of the dZCGCAAATTTGCG. 2 duplex and its complex with a propamidine reporter ligand has been examined in aqueous solution by two-dimensional NMR at two spectrometer frequencies and three temperatures. Quantitative analysis of ROESY and NOESY cross-peaks showed effective correlation times of ; 0.5 ns at 283 K for DNA-water interactions in the major groove. In some cases the sign of the NOE inverts on changing either the temperature or spectrometer frequency. Larger effective correlation times of ; 1 ns were observed for water interactions with A5ZH2. and A6ZH2. atoms located in the minor groove. Interproton NOEs and changes in chemical shifts showed that propamidine binds in the minor groove 5X-AATTT region of the host duplex, but does not displace waters adjacent to either A5ZH2. or A6ZH2.. In the complex, the effective correlation times of these waters increase more than two-fold, possibly as a result of stabilisation due to H-bonded interaction with the amidine groups of the ligand. Hydration of the bound molecule was also found, suggesting that water may contribute to the DNA binding process for bisZamidine. drugs. Structure refinement by a NOE-restrained dynamic annealing procedure revealed that ligand binding is non-centrosymmetric with respect to the duplex, in accordance with the energetically favoured 5X-ATT Z' 5X-AAT. sites predicted by analytical molecular modelling. In particular, the bound propamidine spans 3-4 base pairs in the A6-T7-T8 tract and makes close H-bonded contacts with AZN3rO4X . acceptors positioned close to the minor groove floor. The refined NMR structure for the DNA-propamidine complex is compared with that determined recently using X-ray crystallographic methods.

1. Introduction Hydration is an important determinant of DNA structure: at low water activity DNA duplexes can adopt an A-type conformation, whereas under physiological conditions they are normally in the B family of conformations w1x. It has been suggested that there is a minor groove spine of hydration in B-form DNA w2,3x, which is particularly stable in narrowed

Because selected experimental techniques monitor different physical properties of DNA-bound water w6,7x, a detailed picture of hydration and its effects on conformation requires several methods to be applied for a particular system. For example, thermodynamic methods assess global water properties such as the hydration number, effective density and compressibility w6,7x. In contrast, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis provides information about ordered water populations at specific sites, whereas NMR measures the kinetic stability of a sub-population of water molecules close to the DNA surface w8,9x. Although several X-ray analyses of DNA hydration have appeared w3,10x, there have been few analytical NMR reports for hydration of nucleic acids. Relatively long-lived water has been observed by NMR in the minor groove near the AZH2. protons of dZCGCGAATTCGCG. 2 w8,9x, which has also been extensively studied by crystallography w2,11x. Slowly exchanging waters have also been identified near AZH2. for dZ A 5T5 . 2 and dZGTGGAATTCCAC. 2 w12x, but not dZGTGGTTAACCAC. 2 , suggesting that this behaviour may be associated with a narrowed dA n P dTn minor groove. Similar slow exchange was seen for waters in the minor groove of the non-self-comp le m e n ta ry d Z C C T A A A T T T G C C . P dZGGCAAATTTAGG. duplex w13x, together with extensive major groove hydration, although the latter waters were reported to have much shorter residence times.

Hydration of specific groups in nucleic acids can be detected using NMR methods by observing magnetisation exchange between solute and water protons w14x. The lifetime of the bound-state water affects the intensity of cross-peaks in both NOESY and ROESY spectra. However, only approximate limits have hitherto been reported for the bound lifetimes of the longest-lived water molecules. In this article, we describe the hydration of the dZCGCAAATTTGCG. 2 duplex as probed by NMR. This dodecamer Ztermed A3T3. has been characterised in detail and has a narrowed minor groove associated with the extended AT tract w15≠17x that should be suitable for observing a stable spine of hydration w2,9,12x. We have also examined the effects of a DNA minor groove-binding ligand Zpropamidine, Fig. 1. upon the hydration. Further, quantitative analysis of the DNA-water dipolar interactions has been used to place more precise limits on the correlation times for water molecules in both the major and minor grooves.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials The dZ CGCAAATTTGCG. dodecamer was synthesised using phosphoramidite chemistry and purified as described previously w18x. The duplex was prepared by slow annealing from 355 K, followed by extensive dialysis Z aqueous 5 mM Na phosphate, 100

The final concentration was 1.1 mM in duplex.

NMR spectroscopy and hydration measurements NMR spectra were recorded on Varian UnityPlus Z11.75 T. and Varian Unity Z14.1 T. spectrometers. The intense water signal was suppressed using a Watergate gradient pulse sequence w20x as the read pulse in NOESY experiments, which were recorded with 50≠100 ms mixing times. Acquisition times were typically 0.25≠0.4 s in t 2 and 0.03 s in t 1. The data matrices were zero-filled to 16384= 2048 complex points and apodised using an unshifted Gaussian function. Fourier transforms were performed using the low-frequency filter contained in the Varian software. The spectra were further treated using a baseline correction along F2. ROESY spectra were recorded with similar acquisition parameters, but using a mixing time of 50 ms and a spin-lock field strength of 4≠4.5 kHz. NOESY and ROESY spectra were recorded with the carrier set at the water frequency, and at three temperatures Z 277, 283 and 293

K.. NMR signals were assigned using these spectra, together with TOCSY spectra recorded using MLEV17 for isotropic mixing w21x at a spin-lock field strength of 10 kHz. All two-dimensional spectra were recorded using the methods of States et al. w22x to produce pure absorption mode peaks. Control experiments performed in D 2 O, or in H 2 O with the carrier moved off the water resonance, showed that there was no significant interference from axial peaks along the F2 axis at the carrier frequency. Quantitative analysis of DNA hydration rests upon the determination of relative cross-relaxation rate constants from NOESY and ROESY spectra. The rate constants s in the rotating Zr. and laboratory Zl. frames are given by:

sr s Z arr 6 . P 3 J Z v . q 2 J Z 0 . ; s 1 s Z arr 6 . P 6 J Z 2 v . y J Z 0 .

Thus, the ratio R is a function only of t and the Zknown. v frequency. This function, shown in Fig. 2, would be appropriate for water molecules that are bound to DNA for long times compared with the relaxation rates, but which have extensive internal motions to produce short effective correlation times. Thus, within the terms of the Lipari and Szabo model w23x, positive cross-relaxation rate constants can only be achieved when the molecular tumbling is in the slow motion limit and the order parameter is near zero. In the limit that this parameter approaches zero, the effective correlation time is given Zignoring exchange. by t s t 0t irZt 0 q t i . where t 0 and t i are the correlation times for molecular rotation and internal motion, respectively. When t i is not much smaller than t 0 , the decoupling of internal motions and molecular tumbling breaks down, and further motional modes must be considered w24x.

For waters that exchange between solute and bulk solvent through translational diffusion, the relative solute and water motions affect the spectral density function w14x, which is then inversely proportional to the translational diffusion constant w25x. A detailed calculation w26x has shown that for spheres of radii a1 and a 2 , with a closest molecular approach b s a1 q a 2 , the spectral density function for translational motion is given by: J Z v . s Z Nrp Db . P f Z vt .

Similar expressions apply to the ROESY experiment, although other off-resonance effects must be taken into account. The cross-relaxation rate constant in the rotating frame for two spins i,j is given w28,29x by:

s s sin f i P sin f j P sr Z i,j . q cos f i P cos f j P s 1Z i,j .

Z7.
where sr and s l are the rate constants in the rotating and laboratory frames, respectively, and f is the angle that the tilted field makes with the z-axis: tan f s v 1Z v i y v 0 .

Z4.

where N is the spin density, D is the relative translational diffusion constant and fZ vt . is a complex function. Nevertheless, the ratio R is a function only of the correlation time that characterises the lifetime of the water in the bound state w8,9,12≠14,27x. This forms the basis for the analysis of water molecules bound weakly to macromolecules w14x. The rotational motion of waters while in the vicinity of the solute will also affect the spectral density function; the correlation time and degree of spatial restriction for this rotation also become important. The cross-relaxation ratio for this intermediate situation would be expected to lie between the two extremes shown in Fig. 2. R can be estimated from experimental measurements of cross-peak intensities as follows. For short mixing times, the volume of a water Z w. to DNA Zd. cross-peak in a Watergate NOESY experiment is given by:
0 VN Z w,d . s V N Z w . P s 1Z w,d . P t m P f wg Z d . 0 V N Zw.

Z8.

where v i is the frequency of resonance i, v 1 is the spin-lock strength and v 0 is the carrier frequency. The cross-peak intensities are scaled with an additional factor of sin f i P sin f j , since the magnetisation is first projected along the spin-lock axis and then back into the transverse plane. In the particular case of DNA-water cross-peaks, the water is exactly on resonance Z f j s 908. so that the cross-peak intensity is given by: Vr Z w,d . s Vr 0 Z w . P sr Z w,d . P t m P f wg Z r . P sin2 fd

Z9.

A similar expression applies to the cytosine H5-H6 cross-peak, as the H5 resonances used for normalisation are close to the carrier frequency Zsee Section 3.. The normalised intensity is then given by: Vr n Z w,d . s

Z5.

sr Z w,d . P f wg Z d . P Vr 0 Z w,d . P sin2 fd sr Z H5,H6 . P f wg Z H6 . P Vr 0 Z H5 . P sin2 f H6

where is the volume of the diagonal peak at zero mixing time, s l is the cross relaxation rate constant for the DNA-water interaction, t m is the mixing time and f wgZ d. is the excitation factor for the Watergate pulse. As the measured volumes have arbitrary units and instrumental factors for ROESY and NOESY experiments are not necessarily identical, the cross-peak intensity is normalised to that of the cytosine H5-H6 cross-peak:
n VN Z w,d . s

and the ratio of the normalised NOESY and ROESY cross-peak volumes becomes: R exp s

In this expression, the Watergate terms cancel and the trigonometric factors can be determined using the known offsets from the transmitter and the strength of the calibrated B 1 field. As the recycle time was kept identical for both ROESY and NOESY experi-

ments, the saturation factor Zwhich affects V 0 . is the same for each peak and hence the ratio for diagonal peak volumes is unity. Finally, for large rotational correlation times Zi.e., t ) 3 ns. the ratio of cross-relaxation rates s lZ H5,H6.rsr Z H5,H6. is y0.5 Zcf. Fig. 2.. The rotational correlation time in D 2 O was determined as 3.2 ns at 303 K w17x, corresponding to ; 4.9 ns in H 2 O at 283 K. Taking into account the various factors, the experimental ratio becomes: R exp s y2 s 1Z w,d .

which provides an estimate of the required ratio. It has been assumed that the NOE intensity is proportional to the cross-relaxation rate constant and the mixing time. For a correlation time of ; 5≠6 ns, there will be some spin-lattice relaxation for most spins over a period of 50≠100 ms. However, relaxation is small for AZH2. and H 2 O as the T1 values are long. Further, the important value is the ratio of cross-relaxation rates in the rotating and laboratory frames. As the spin-lattice relaxation rate constant in the rotating frame is 2.5-fold greater than that in the laboratory frame, using a shorter mixing time in the ROESY than in the NOESY experiment largely compensates for this factor. Calculations Z not shown. indicate that relaxation effects under the experimental conditions used are likely to cause R to be overestimated by F 10%. For negative NOEs and positive ROEs, R is negative, which implies that the effective correlation time teff is longer than 1rv , i.e., ; 0.3 ns Zcf. minimum t-value for the isotropic rotor with internal motion, Fig. 2.. However, for positive NOEs and positive ROEs, R is positive. The observation of negative ROESY cross-peaks indicates slow exchange or spin-diffusion effects; analysis of such peaks was not attempted. Thus, for waters with teff values near 1rv , changing the magnetic field strength may alter the sign of the NOE. 2.3. Molecular modelling and structure refinement The enthalpy surface for interaction between propamidine and the minor groove tract of a canonical B-DNA dZCGCAAATTTGCG. 2 duplex was computed using a 0.01-bp step size, as described for analogous A2T2-bisZamidine. complexes w30x.

The solution structure of the 1:1 DNA-propamidine complex was refined by docking the ligand at one predicted low-energy minor groove site and using a NOE-restrained simulated annealing procedure w17,30≠32x with the determined A3T3-ligand NOEs ZTable 3.. As noted for other DNA-bisZamidine. complexes w30x, the refinement was not biased by the choice of starting model; similar structures resulted from treatment of either centrosymmetric Z"0 bp. or asymmetric complexes. Soft glycosidic dihedral constraints Zi.e., x " 108. were applied using angles determined for the native duplex by NMR solution methods w17x. Similarly, intrasugar H1-H4X NOE distance restraints were taken from NMR studies with the A3T3 duplex w17x, leading to 24 additional DNA distance restraints. Molecular dynamics was carried out for 60 ps Zi.e., 10 ps post-heating equilibration q50 ps simulated annealing. at 300 K, with system sampling at 0.2-ps intervals. The protocols used for NOE assignment, distance scaling and the four-stage X-PLOR structure refinement are detailed in the accompanying article w30x.

3. Results 3.1. Free DNA Exchangeable and non-exchangeable proton resonances for the free A3T3 duplex were assigned using NOESY Zcf. Fig. 3., ROESY and TOCSY spectra, and are given in Table 1. The assignments at 283 K agree with our previous report, except for the small effect of temperature w17x. Exchange cross-peaks, verified in the ROESY spectra, were observed for G2Z N1H. and the non-H-bonded cytosineradenine amino protons. At 283 K, the G1ZNH. resonance is not visible, but was observed as a broad peak at 277 K Znot shown. . Exchange between the thymidine N3H protons and water, which could interfere with NOEs from non-exchangeable protons to water via spin diffusion, was insignificant at all temperatures - 293 K. We estimate from the upper limit to the cross-peak intensity spectra that the exchange rate constant under these conditions is - 0.5 sy1.

We confirmed that these NOEs originate from direct interacTable 2 Ratios of cross-relaxation rate constants for A3T3-water interactions Proton Free duplex T s 283 K R A4ZH8. A4ZH2. A5ZH2. A6ZH2.

tion with water in two ways. First, the carrier position was moved 50 Hz off resonance; the same cross-peaks were observed as at the water frequency, hence they cannot arise from incomplete suppression of axial peaks. Second, the water frequency is d 4.91 at 283 K and shifts to d 4.96 Z277 K. and d 4.86 Z288 K., whereas DNA proton shifts vary by - 0.01 ppm over this temperature range. As the same NOEs to base protons Zexcept the three TZH6. protons. were observed at all temperatures, we conclude that they do not arise from spin diffusion due to resonance of H3X protons at the water frequency. However, apparent NOEs to the H2XrH2Y spectral region did alter significantly on changing the temperature, and correlated well with H3X that resonate at the water frequency. Hence, these latter NOEs arise from interactions with the H3X protons rather than water, which is expected since the H2X and H3X atoms are spatially close. The correlation time at which the NOE changes sign is inversely proportional to the spectrometer frequency. As the sign for the A4Z H8.-water NOE reverses on changing the spectrometer frequency or by altering the temperature between 277 and 293 K Zat 600 MHz., it is clear that the water near this proton has a teff value of ; 0.3 ns. Similarly, as the NOE for G2Z H8.-water is positive, the teff for this water is - 0.3 ns at 283 K. The TZ Me.-water NOEs are also positive, but this may be complicated by the rapid internal rotation. For all other DNA-water interactions the NOE is negative, implying teff values ) 0.3 ns. To analyse the data further, the ratio R of the

The NOE data for A4ZH2. in the free DNA could not be quantified due to spectral overlap of exchanging NH 2 resonances; however, the NOE is negative, implying teff ) 0.3 ns. The NOEs to TZMe. groups and the data in Table 2 show that Z1. both DNA grooves are in contact with water, and Z2. the teff values are 0.3≠0.5 ns in the major groove and slightly longer in the minor groove. 3.2. DNA-propamidine complex Titration of the A3T3 duplex with propamidine showed that the chemical shifts of the N3H protons of T7 and T9 crossed over Z Dd s 0.12 ppm.; the shifts of the GZN1H. resonances were essentially unaffected. The resonances for the complex at a wligandx:wDNAx molar ratio of 1.1:1 were assigned using NOESY ZFig. 5. and TOCSY, and are listed in Table 1. Strong exchange peaks to the water are

present at d 13.14 for G12ZN1H. and from two peaks at ; 8.9 ppm, assigned to distinguishable amidinium protons for the bound ligand Zsee below.. Strong chemical shift effects were seen for the A5rA6ZH2., A6-T9ZH1X . and A6-T9ZH4X . protons; Fig. 6 shows the ligand-induced shift profile. The largest shifts were found for protons in the minor groove A5-T9 tract, consistent with binding to this conduit of the duplex. The shift pattern indicates significant perturbation over a ; 5 bp region. This represents an upper limit for the binding site since the ring current field of the ligand may extend beyond the physical boundaries of the molecule. DNA-ligand NOEs were observed primarily to minor groove A5, A6, T7 and T8 protons. Further weak NOEs ZTable 3. were observed to A4Z H2. and T9ZH1X ., possibly as a result of spin diffusion. However, as the asymmetric shift perturbation profile ZFig. 6. suggests that the ligand binds non-centrosymmetrically, these NOEs could arise from a weak direct interaction. Because propamidine can span approx. 3.5 bp w31x, it is likely that there are two or

more overlapping binding sites within the 5X-AATTT segment, possibly with unequal affinities. We have previously reported competitor binding sites for this extended AT-tract sequence w17x. The amidinium moieties of the free ligand were assigned using one-dimensional NOE spectroscopy as

the inner and outer protons ZH a and H b , respectively, in Fig. 1. could be distinguished. A NOESY spectrum of the complex recorded at 277 K showed relatively slow exchange of these NH 2 protons, and one NOE was observed involving the H3r5 ring protons Zbut not the 2,6 protons. of the bound ligand Zcf. Fig. 5.. This identifies the sharper, low-field signal as the outer NH a and, by implication, the broader signal to the inner NH b . This latter proton also showed complete exchange with water Zmixing time s 70 ms., suggesting that the outer H a amidine protons are somewhat protected from exchange in the complex. The linewidth for NH b was 35 Hz at 277 K, and ; 45 Hz at 283 K. Based on our structure for the complex Zsee below., we calculate dipolar linewidth contributions of 25 Hz Z277 K. and 21 Hz Z283 K., hence the exchange contribution to the linewidth is F 10 Hz at 277 K and ; 25 Hz at 283 K. Other linewidth factors, such as exchange between competitor sites within the complex, would further reduce the maximum contribution from solvent-mediated exchange. Chemical shifts for the propamidine ligand are collected in Table 4, which shows that all protons shift substantially downfield upon complexation. Fig. 7 shows cross-sections of NOESY and ROESY spectra through the water resonance. The dipolar peaks for A4-6Z H2. are still present, indicating that

exchange contribution to the linewidth for NH a is F 10 Hz Zsee above., the exchange-mediated magnetisation transfer from water to AZH2. is substantially reduced. However, the observed transfer from water to AZ H2. was much larger, such that the crosspeak intensity integrated to 20≠40% of the CZH5-H6.

NH a and NH b refer to the `outer' and `inner' amidinium protons of the bisZamidine., respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.

solvent molecules remain close to these protons in the complex. The R-values for bound waters ZTable 2. are essentially unaltered for interactions in the major groove, as expected for a minor groove ligand that induces little structural perturbation w17x. There is also probably no significant effect on the correlation time of the water bound close to A4Z H2., which is consistent with the absence of any substantial NOEs from the ligand to A4 minor groove protons ZTable 3.. In contrast, the teff values for waters close to A5ZH2. and A6ZH2. appear to increase in the presence of ligand, even though there are substantial NOEs from the ligand H2r6 to these base protons. This was confirmed at 277 K ZFig. 5., where exchange with water was greater for H b than for H a. In principle, magnetisation originating from water could reach AZH2. by the water TM Zamidine.NH a TM AZH2. pathway, where the first step is determined by the exchange of H a with water, and the second step is cross-relaxation. Whereas the ligand H a showed a clear NOE to the H3r5 protons, there was no detectable NOE with any AZH2., which effectively eliminates this pathway. In part, this is due to the 0.32≠0.4 nm separation for these protons, leading to a small cross-relaxation rate constant; rapid autorelaxation of the H a protons also results in a very small intrinsic interproton NOE. We have also used a full-relaxation matrix simulation of the entire spin system, using the coordinates of our refined DNA-ligand structure and the program NUCFIT w34x, to examine the NOE time course from H a to the AZH2. protons. The maximum direct NOE was calculated to be - 10% of the cytosine H5-H6 cross-peak intensity. Further, at 277 K, where the

Nevertheless, as the amidinium H a and H b protons are clearly hydrated Z since they exchange with solvent. , it is possible that there are water molecules that can `bridge' the ligand to the host DNA duplex. 3.3.

A total of 100 NOE distance restraints Zi.e., 24 q 4 DNA, 16 ligand, and 56 DNA-ligand., together with 24 glycosidic angle constraints, was used in the MD refinement procedure.

The interphenyl twist angle of 118 for the ligand is also smaller than the 30≠348 range from DNA-propamidine crystal structures w19,37x.

Additional favourable hydrophobic contacts are made between the minor groove walls and the phenyl rings of the ligand, aligned in an effectively parallel arrangement, so as to largely dictate energetically favourable binding. Helix analysis of the complex using the Curves 4.1 package w38,39x shows an average helical rise of 0.326 " 0.030 nm and a mean twist of 38 " 38 per base pair Z9.5 bprturn; pitch s 3.1 nm., in accord with an overall B-type duplex conformation. Further, the phosphates are of B I type and all sugars adopt near-C2X-endo puckers, with pseudorotation phase angles in the 136≠1758 range, confirming the retention of B-DNA features. Global axis shortening w39x induced by the ligand is - 0.4%, indicating that complexation causes little duplex bending. The refined solution structure for the complex ZFig. 9A. is similar to that recently reported in the crystal state w37x. Both structures are characterised by asymmetric ligand positions although details of Hbonded contacts are somewhat different, possibly reflecting experimental differences such as the co-solutes present. However, in contrast with earlier crystallographic studies of bisZ amidine. complexes w19,35,36x but in agreement with this report and our earlier NMR solution studies w17,31,32x, the propamidine is displaced by ; 0.5 bp in the 3X-direction from the duplex centre in the crystal state w37x. This result provides support for our calculations of enthalpic energy surfaces for groove binding to modelled ATDNA duplexes. Global helix parameters for the A3T3 duplex w16x and the A3T3-propamidine complexes determined by solution NMR Zthis study. and crystallography w37x are compared in Table 5. Coordinates for the two

crystal structures were taken from the Nucleic Acid Database w40x, deposited as references BDL038 and GDL032. Ligand-induced DNA conformation changes ZTable 5. are largely insignificant, suggesting that the binding site is essentially preformed and that propamidine does not cause helical perturbation. Interestingly, relatively few waters of hydration were reported for the crystal structure of this complex w37x with no evidence for either water-bridged arrangements or a `spine of hydrophobic hydration' w19x close to the bound ligand. In our system, attempts to model dynamic complexes with a water ZTIP3P. molecule as a bridge from the amidinium moiety Z H a or H b . to base acceptors at the minor groove floor, using the ligand-water NOEs shown in Table 3, were inconclusive. Further calculations on the hydration are planned.

4. Discussion DNA is known to be highly hydrated in solution w1x. The NMR methods used here detect only a small fraction of these waters for the A3T3 duplex with effective correlation times teff longer than ; 0.2 ns. A few waters can be detected in the major groove with teff values of ; 0.3 ns at 283 K, so the sign of the NOE is sensitive to both temperature and magnetic field strength. The TZMe. groups also show positive NOEs with water, indicating weak hydration and confirming that most of the major groove is contacted by solvent. If teff is interpreted as an estimate of the residence time for bound waters w14x, then, for the major groove, it is similar to the time taken for water to diffuse from a planar surface in the absence of a restraining potential. This may simply reflect the presence of water due to its very high concentration Z55.5 M.. Indeed, k off f 3 P 10 9 sy1 and k on f 10 10 My1 sy1 rate constants indicate a K d value of ; 0.3 M, so that each accessible site would Zon average. be in contact with water for ) 99% of the time. Some minor groove waters may have ) 0.5 ns residence times, i.e., slightly longer than the weakly bound waters associated with the major groove, suggesting that there may be at least some kinetic stabilisation. Further, the weak temperature dependence of the apparent residence times indicates that the activa-

tion energy for diffusion from the DNA surface may not be much larger than that for free diffusion Z; 20 kJ moly1 ., and hence that the DNA-water interaction energy is small. The R-values found in this study are comparable to values reported with other duplexes Ze.g., 0 to y0.5 for AZH2.., depending on the sequence context and temperature w9,12,13x Zand see accompanying article.. We have also noted that in the longer sequence dZ CATGTGACGTCACATG. 2 no water molecules show both large NOEs and large ROEs, even for the minor groove AZ H2. protons ZM.R. Conte and A.N. Lane, unpublished data., indicating that all teff values are ; 0.2≠0.4 ns for this sequence. Propamidine clearly binds in the minor groove of the A5-T8rT9 base segment through a non-centrosymmetric binding mode. Interestingly, the structure determined for the A3T3 complex in solution is qualitatively similar to that recently reported in the crystal state w37x, and confirms that ligand displacement from the dyad centre leads to more effective binding with this extended AT-tract duplex. Our molecular modelling studies thus provide a firm qualitative basis for the binding achieved with this and other bisZamidines., where favoured interactions are determined by a combination of non-bonded energy factors. Complexation with propamidine has little effect on teff values for waters bound either in the major groove or at sites adjacent to the minor groove binding site, e.g., A4 Zcf. Fig. 8.. Despite physical occupation of the A3T3 minor groove and close positioning of ligand protons near A5Z H2. and A6ZH2. , the teff values for bound waters in the vicinity of A5 and A6 are increased by the introduced ligand. This stabilisation could reflect either an increased lifetime for the bound state or a reduction of internal mobility compared to the free A3T3 duplex. Judging from the differential exchange of amidinium protons with water, the propamidine molecule may itself be hydrated in the complex. This would be consistent with crystallographic observations that waters can provide `three-centre' H-bonded bridges between the amidinium protons and DNA acceptors close to the minor groove floor w19,35≠37x. Such processes would be expected to markedly decrease the mobility of the water molecules involved. Netropsin, an established DNA minor groove-bind-

ing ligand, displaces a large number of waters on complexation, depending on the base sequence w7x. The thermodynamic methods used in such studies monitor all waters, whereas NMR can detect only a small sub-population. Ligand stabilisation of only relatively few bound waters does not necessarily contradict the general release of hydration waters w7x, but rather points to the possibility of certain water molecules being implicated in ligand binding.
