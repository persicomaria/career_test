The crystal structure of leishmania triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) complexed with 2-(N-formyl-N-hydroxy)-aminoethyl phosphonate (IPP) highlights the importance of Asn11 for binding and catalysis. IPP is an analogue of the substrate D -glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and it is observed to bind with its aldehyde oxygen in an oxyanion hole formed by ND2 of Asn11 and NE2 of His95. Comparison of the mode of binding of IPP and the transition state analogue phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH) suggests that the Glu167 side

chain, as well as the triose part of the substrate, adopt different conformations as the catalysed reaction proceeds. Comparison of the TIM ­IPP and the TIM­PGH structures with other liganded and unliganded structures also highlights the conformational flexibility of the ligand and the active site, as well as the conserved mode of ligand binding. Keywords: hydroxamate; oxyanion hole; TIM; transition state analogue.

Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM; EC 5.3.1.1) catalyses the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (GrnP ) and D -glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GraP ) [1], as shown in Fig. 1. The catalysed reaction involves the shuttling of protons; no cofactors or metals are required. The mechanism of this isomerization reaction remains an object of intense research [2]. The mechanistic uncertainties concern in particular the way in which the enzyme stabilizes the transition state, as well as the sequence of the proton shuttling steps. TIM is a dimeric glycolytic enzyme, consisting of two identical subunits of 250 residues. The active site of TIM is constructed at the C-terminal end of the b strands of a TIMbarrel fold. The eight central b strands of the scaffold are labeled from the N-terminus to the C-terminus as b1­b8, the corresponding a-helices are labeled a1­a8. The loops connecting the b strands to the subsequent helices are called loops 1­8. TIM has a very narrow substrate specificity. In fact, GrnP and GraP are the only known substrates. The catalytic mechanism, in particular the role of the active-site residues Lys13, His95, and Glu167, has been studied with a variety of experimental [1] and computational techniques [2]. TIM is a very efficient enzyme, the rate of the catalysed reaction being diffusion-determined. The catalysed reaction proceeds

109 times faster than the uncatalysed reaction. Both in the forward reaction, with GrnP as the substrate, and in the backward reaction, with GraP as the substrate, a proton needs to be extracted from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (Fig. 1). The geometry of the liganded active site has been studied in great detail from structures of TIM complexed with the active site ligands 2-phosphoglycolate [3] and phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH) [4 ­6]. PGH (Fig. 2) is a transition state analogue, in which the planar hydroxamate moiety mimics the planar reaction intermediate structure (Fig. 1). Much information about the mechanism has also been derived from studies on the enzymological and structural properties of variants with mutated active site residues, as well as from computer simulations of the reaction cycle [2,7 ­9]. Glu167 is the catalytic base for the proton abstraction in both the forward and the back reaction. It abstracts the pro-R proton from the C1 atom of GrnP in the forward reaction and the proton from the C2 carbon of GraP in the reverse reaction. Lys13 has been shown to be essential for binding and catalysis [10]. It is known to be hydrogen bonded directly to the O2 atom of the ligand, stabilizing the developing negative charge at this atom [10]. His95 is hydrogen bonded to both O1 and O2 of the ligand, but its role in the proton shuttling events is not fully understood [2,7,11]. At least two proton transfer mechanisms are currently being discussed. They are referred to as the `classical' and the `criss-cross' mechanism. In both mechanisms, the first step is the proton abstraction from a carbon atom by the glutamate side chain. This step is facilitated by the presence of an oxyanion hole, as highlighted in Fig. 1. Such an oxyanion hole provides electrostatic stabilization of the transiently developing negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen atom. Possibly, this negative charge is further stabilized by an actual proton transfer by the proton donors shaping the oxyanion hole [12]. In the classical mechanism [1,13], the carboxylate group of Glu167 abstracts the C1-proton of GrnP, generating an enediolate intermediate.

Fig. 1. The possible steps of the `criss-cross' reaction mechanism. Polarizing the carbonyl oxygen weakens the C-H bond of the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group [40,41]. Therefore, in the first step, an oxyanion hole for the keto-oxygen atom (O2) facilitates proton abstraction at C1. In the second step an oxyanion hole for the aldehyde oxygen atom (O1) facilitates the exchange of a proton from C2. Oxyanion hole 1 is formed by NZ of Lys13 and NE2 of His95. As discussed in the text, it is suggested that NE2 of His95 and ND2 of Asn11 form oxyanion hole 2. The catalytic base, B, is Glu167. The intermediate structures are in square brackets; the thin arrows indicate the structural rearrangements in the forward direction. Other aspects of the shuttling mechanism are discussed in the text.

Subsequently, the oxygen protons are exchanged via the His95 side chain that transiently occurs as a negatively charged imidazolate ion [11]. In the last step, the carboxylate proton is delivered to the C2 carbon atom. In the criss-cross mechanism [14,15], the Glu167 side chain abstracts a proton from the C1 carbon atom and transfers this proton to the O2 oxygen. Subsequently, Glu167 abstracts a proton from the O1 oxygen and transfers it to the C2 carbon, resulting in the product, GraP. In this mechanism, the negatively charged imidazolate intermediate does not occur.

NMR data, in combination with, e.g. isotope labeling studies, indicate that during catalysis, both mechanisms could contribute to the overall reaction [15]. Recent theoretical calculations suggest that in the predominant mechanism, all proton transfer steps are catalysed by the Glu167 side chain [9] (Fig. 1). In addition to the three residues involved directly in catalysis (Glu167, His95, and Lys13), there are several other conserved active-site residues, such as Asn11 and Cys126 that are fully conserved, but for which no exact role has been assigned. Upon ligand binding, the enzyme adopts a closed conformation, in which loop 6 closes over the active site [16­18]. In addition, a conformational switch of loop 7 occurs, involving the Tyr210-Gly211-Gly212-Ser213-peptide. The peptide oxygen of Gly211 rotates by 908, and the peptide plane of Gly212 flips 1808. The closed conformations of loop 6 and loop 7, together with loop 8, which does not change conformation upon ligand binding, provide a perfect binding pocket for the phosphate moiety. In this mode of binding the oxygen atoms of the phosphate are hydrogen bonded to the peptide NH groups of loop 6, loop 7, and loop 8 [19]. Ligand binding also induces a conformational switch of the side chain of Glu167 [3,6]. In the apo structure, this side chain is hydrogen bonded to Ser96, away from the ligand-binding site (the swung-out position). In the presence of a ligand, this side chain rotates towards the ligand (the swung-in position) interacting directly with it, which can be seen in several structures of TIM­ligand complexes. The best inhibitor of TIM is PGH, with a Kd of 4 mM [20]. The pKa of the hydroxyl moiety of PGH is 9.5 [20,21]. Protonated PGH is isostructural to the substrate GrnP. We have studied the mode of binding of another hydroxamate, 2-(N-formyl-N-hydroxy)amino-ethylphosphonate (IPP), which is an analogue of GraP (Fig. 2) and an inhibitor of TIM [22]. Here, we report on the crystal structure of leishmania TIM complexed with IPP, as well as on a comparison of the TIM­IPP structure with other liganded and unliganded TIM structures.

Protein purification, enzymatic assay and crystallization The experiments have been performed with the E65Q variant of Leishmania mexicana TIM in which Glu65 has been replaced by a glutamine. This variant has the same kinetic properties as the wild type protein, but it is much more stable [23]. The purification and expression of the E65Q variant have been described previously [24]. Enzymatic activity measurements were carried out in a narrow well microtiterplate (Costar) using a Spectramax340 microtiterplate reader (Molecular Devices) by monitoring the NADH absorbance at 340 nm during 10 min at 25 8C. The reaction volume was 80 mL. The reaction mixture contained 15 mU of TIM, 0­0.5 mM IPP, 0.045­0.717 mM GraP, 0.5 mM NADH, and 0.25 mg glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase in 75 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.6. Kinetic constants were obtained by fitting the data using the GRAFIT software. Crystallization was carried out at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The 4 mL drops,

containing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution, were equilibrated against 1000 mL of reservoir solution [21% poly(ethylene glycol) 6000, 100 mM CH3COOH/ NaOH, pH 4.5, 1 mM reduced dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM sodium azide]. The protein solution contained 11 mg:mL21 protein and 10 mM 2-phosphoglycolate. The crystals reached their maximum size in less than a week. Before data collection, the crystals were transferred at room temperature to a drop containing 23% PEG 6000, 100 mM CH3COOH/NaOH, pH 4.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium azide, and 5 mM IPP. Two transfer steps were used, and the latter soaking was performed over night. Finally, just prior to freezing, the crystals were soaked in the same solution containing 25% glycerol as the cryoprotectant. Data collection, structure determination, refinement, and structure analysis ° A dataset at 2.0-A resolution was collected from a single crystal at 100 K on a MAR345 image plate detector mounted on a Nonius FR591 rotating anode equipped with an Oxford Cryosystems 600 series cryo device.

with DENZO and SCALEPACK [25]. Further data reduction was performed with programs of the CCP 4 package [26]. The crystal belongs to the space group C2, with one subunit in the ° asymmetric unit. The unit cell parameters are a ¼ 99.23 A, ° ° b ¼ 52.83 A, c ¼ 58.94 A, b ¼ 118.038, which indicates a solvent content of 51%. A total of 74 174 reflections were observed and merged into 18318 unique reflections. The data statistics are shown in Table 1. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE [27]. The previously determined roomtemperature structure of the same protein complexed with 2-phosphoglycolate ([28], RCSB PDB code 1QDS) was used as the search model. The side chain of Glu167 was left out of the search model. 5% of the data were excluded from refinement as free-R-flagged reflections. The subsequent rigid body refinement with REFMAC [29] resulted in Rfreeand R-values of 23.3% and 22.9%, respectively. Clear density for the IPP molecule and the side chain of Glu167 was visible in the Fo­ Fc maps. The structure was refined with REFMAC [29]. Water molecules were added with the program ARP -WARP [30]. The refinement resulted in a model with good geometry and R-free and R-values of 18.1% and 13.6%, respectively (Table 1). The program O [31] was used for model building. The quality of the model was analysed with PROCHECK [32]. Three unliganded and seven liganded structures, as listed in Table 2, were used for the comparisons. The residue numbering scheme of trypanosomal TIM is used. The Ca atoms of the framework residues were used for the superpositions and the programs O [31], WHAT IF [33], and ICM [34] were used for analyzing the structures. The Ramachandran plot, as calculated by PROCHECK , showed only one residue, Lys13, in the generously disallowed region. Lys13, the catalytic lysine, is known to be in a strained conformation [6] in all TIM structures. All other residues have adopted phi/psi values in the most favored region (94.6%) and in the additionally allowed region (5%). Synthesis of 2-(N-formyl-N-hydroxyamino) ethylphosphonate (IPP) IPP was synthesized in three steps according to previously described protocols [35,36]. A solution of tert-butyl N-(benzyloxy)carbamate (4.55 g, 20.4 mmol) in 10 mL dry dimethylformamide was added dropwise to sodium hydride (60% suspension in mineral oil, 0.90 g, 22.5 mmol) and stirred for 50 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to 210 8C, and a solution of diethyl 2-bromoethylphosphonate (5.00 g, 20.4 mmol) in 10 mL dry dimethylformamide was slowly added. After the addition was completed, the temperature was allowed to rise to room temperature, and stirring was continued for 48 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (100 mL) and extracted three times with 50 mL of ethylacetate. The combined organic layer was washed with brine (100 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. Evaporation and purification by silicagel column chromatography (hexane ­ ethanolacetate) yielded diethyl-2-[(benzyloxy)(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino] ethylphosphonate as a colourless oil (3.00 g, 7.74 mmol, 38%). The oil obtained was mixed with concentrated hydrochloric acid and boiled for 30 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated, dissolved in a small

The resulting solid was collected by filtration and recrystallised from ethanol/water, yielding 2-(hydroxyamino)-ethylphosphonic acid (0.72 g, 5.10 mmol, 66%). This compound was formylated according to the procedure of Hemmi [35], yielding the monopotassium salt of IPP.

The mode of binding of IPP ° The structure of the TIM ­IPP complex was refined at 2-A resolution. Figure 3 shows the fit of IPP in the Fo­Fc map after omit refinement. The density shows that the mode of binding of IPP is well defined, in good agreement with the inhibition measurements, which indicate a high affinity of IPP for the active site of TIM. The kinetic data showed competition of IPP binding with GraP with a Ki of 50 mM . The hydroxamate moiety is in a planar cis conformation. Two interesting differences can be pointed out when comparing the mode of binding of IPP to leishmania TIM and the binding of PGH to chicken TIM (Fig. 4). Firstly, the hydroxamate planes do not superimpose. In the IPP structure, the proximal part, atoms C1 and O1 are pointing further down, towards the Asn11 side chain. The largest displacement is seen for the O1 atom that has moved by ° approximately 1 A. Secondly, the side chain of the catalytic glutamate has adopted a different orientation. The equivalent carboxylate oxygen atoms have moved also ° approximately 1 A. The interactions between the triose part of IPP and the protein are shown in Fig. 5. The O1 atom is hydrogen bonded to ND2 of Asn11 and to NE2 of His95. The carboxylate oxygens of Glu167 are near the hydroxamate plane. OE2 of Glu167 is near N2, and OE1 of Glu167 is near O2 (Fig. 5). The O2 atom of IPP is also hydrogen bonded to NZ of Lys13 and NE2 of His95. The hydroxamate atoms of IPP and PGH do not contact a water molecule. Apparently, water molecules are not directly involved in the reaction mechanism. In the TIM ­PGH complex, the equivalent Glu167 carboxylate atoms are near N1 and O1. The importance of short low-barrier hydrogen bonds for the reaction mechanism of TIM has been discussed [37­39], and NMR data indicate that the OE1(Glu167)­ O1(PGH) interaction is such an interaction [21]. In TIM­PGH, as in TIM ­IPP, there are hydrogen bonds from NE2 of His95 to O1 and O2. As in the IPP complex, O2 of PGH is also hydrogen bonded to NZ of Lys13 (Fig. 5). In both the TIM­IPP and the TIM­PGH structures, the His95 side chain has no hydrogen bonding interactions with water. NZ of Lys13 is hydrogen bonded to one water molecule. Through this interaction, a water-mediated salt bridge with the phosphate moiety of the ligand is formed. In both structures, NZ of Lys13 contacts the bridging atom ° [C4(IPP)-NZ(Lys13) ¼ 3.2 A and O4(PGH)-NZ(Lys13) ¼ ° 3.4 A]. In both complexes, there is a cluster of three water molecules near the Glu167 side chain (Fig. 4). The importance of this water cluster for the reaction mechanism has been extensively discussed [13].

Common features of ligand binding in the active site of TIM From the superposition of the available structures (Fig. 6), it can be seen that there are two preserved anchoring interactions: (a) the phosphate moiety and (b) atom O2. In all seven liganded structures (Table 2), the phosphate moiety is bound in the same orientation; it is always hydrogen bonded to seven peptide NH-groups, distributed over loops 6, 7, and 8. The O2 atom is hydrogen bonded to NZ of Lys13 and NE2 of His95. In this mode of binding, the O2 atom of the substrate is fixed with respect to the bridging oxygen atom, O4. The near cis arrangement for the torsion angle of the bridging oxygen atom and the O2 atom of the substrate (Table 2) is an essential feature of the TIM active site geometry, as it prevents the undesirable side reaction of phosphate elimination [3]. Figure 7 compares the positioning of the active-site residues and the ligand, as seen in unliganded and liganded TIM structures. The large variability of the Glu167 side-chain conformation is clearly observed. In contrast, the other catalytic residues, in particular Lys13 and His95, always adopt the same conformation.

Conformational flexibility of the Glu167 side chain The Glu167 side chain occurs either in a swung-out position (in the unliganded structure) or in a swung-in position (in the liganded structure) [3,6]. In the swung-out conformation, Glu167 is hydrogen bonded to N(Ser96) and OG(Ser96). In addition, there is a hydrogen bond between OE2 of Glu167 and a water molecule. In this conformation, the Glu167 side chain OE2 atom also contacts SG(Cys126) (Table 2). The ° SG atom of Cys126 is also close to O of Ile124 (at 4.3 A ° distance) and O of Leu93 (at 3.8 A distance), suggesting that the SG proton of Cys126 is hydrogen bonded to these two peptide oxygens (Fig. 7). Therefore, the OE2(Glu167)­ SG(Cys126) contact is a van der Waals contact. Interestingly, in the swung-in conformations, the van der Waals contact with the SG of Cys126 is maintained (Table 2). However, the two hydrogen bonds to Ser96 are lost. They are not replaced by hydrogen bonds to any other protein atoms. In the conformational switch from the swung-out to the swung-in conformation, the Glu167 side chain rotates towards the ligand and towards Leu232. For example, in the TIM ­IPP and the TIM ­PGH complexes, there is a contact

The water cluster contacting Glu167 (three waters) and the bridging water, near Lys13, are shown as green and purple spheres for the TIM­IPP and the TIM­PGH structures, respectively. In the TIM­IPP complex, the hydroxamate moiety has moved down towards Asn11 and the Glu167 side chain has moved towards the front when compared to the TIM­PGH structure.

as well as in the PGH-swung-in conformation, the Glu167 side chain makes no hydrogen bonds with the protein, one hydrogen bond to a water, and one hydrogen bond with the ligand N-hydroxyl group. In the TIM­IPP ° structure, the OE1(Glu167)­O2 distance is 3.3 A and in the TIM ­PGH structure, the OE1(Glu167) ­O1 distance is ° 2.6 A. The observed conformational flexibility of the Glu167 side chain in the swung-in conformation correlates with the relatively high B factors of this side chain in the liganded structures (Table 2); it is also seen that the average B factors of the Glu167 side chain and the interacting ligand are similar. In the unliganded structure, the Glu167 side-chain B factors are in the same range as the B factors of Lys13 and His95 (Table 2). These side chains are well hydrogen bonded to the rest of the protein. In all liganded and unliganded structures, the Lys13 side chain has low B factors and forms a salt bridge to the Glu97 side chain. For the His95 side chain, a strong hydrogen bond is observed from ND1 to N of Glu97 in all structures, suggesting that this histidine is neutral: unprotonated at ND1 and protonated at NE2.

The importance of Asn11 for the reaction mechanism Theoretical calculations have pointed towards a possible role for Asn11 in the reaction mechanism of TIM [2,9]. In providing a positive electrostatic potential, stabilizing a reaction intermediate or transition state. In the known X-ray structures of the complexes, however, only weak hydrogen bonding to O1 is seen (Table 2). In the new structure of the TIM ­ IPP complex, there is good hydrogen bonding between O1 of IPP and ND2 of Asn11 (Table 2). IPP is an analogue of the substrate GraP, and the O1 atom is equivalent to the aldehyde oxygen atom. The TIM ­IPP structure therefore suggests that in the catalytic cycle, a small but significant rearrangement of the substrate also occurs. Upon binding of GrnP, oxyanion hole 1 facilitates the abstraction of the C1 proton of GrnP. Subsequently, the intermediate rearranges in the active site, such that O1 now fits well into oxyanion hole 2 formed by ND2 of Asn11 and NE2 of His95. In this binding mode, the development of a negative charge on the atom O1 is stabilized, which facilitates the proton exchange at atom C2 and the formation of the product, GraP (Fig. 1). In the unliganded structure, a conserved well-defined water molecule is bound in oxyanion hole 2, hydrogen bonded to ND2 of Asn11 and NE2 of His95. This water is displaced upon ligand binding.

between O of Leu232 and the Glu167 side chain (Table 2). From the geometry of the active site, this contact seems to be a van der Waals contact. As can be seen from Fig. 7, this movement of the Glu167 side chain is only possible in the closed conformation of loop 7, as in the open conformation, it would bump into the main chain oxygen of Gly211. There are two structured waters in the region vacated by the Glu167 side chain as it moves towards its new position. Together with the water molecule present in the unliganded structure near OE2(Glu167), these two water molecules form the cluster of three water molecules described previously [13]. Therefore, in the IPP-swung-in,

Upon ligand binding, the Glu167 side chain moves towards O (Leu232). This rearrangement requires that O (Gly211) in loop 7 rotates 908 away from the active site in the liganded structure.

CONCLUSIONS
The abstraction of a proton from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl is facilitated by stabilizing a negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen atom [40,41]. In the forward reaction of TIM, NZ of Lys13 and NE2 of His95 are known to be important in this respect (Fig. 1). The new structure of the TIM­IPP complex suggests that also in the backward reaction, such an oxyanion hole, formed by NE2 of His95 and ND2 of Asn11, exists. The new structural data concerning the mode of binding of IPP also indicate that in the catalytic cycle, both the glutamate side chain and the triose moiety of the substrate display conformational flexibility. This conformational flexibility of the glutamate side chain in the swung-in conformation is facilitated by the absence of hydrogen bonds between this side chain and the rest of the protein in the complex structure. In the presence of the a-hydroxy-keto substrate, the glutamate side-chain carboxylate oxygens are near C1 and O1 of the substrate, allowing the abstraction of the pro-R proton from the C1 carbon atom. This is favoured by the presence of oxyanion hole 1 near the O2 atom. In the presence of the a-hydroxyaldehyde form of the substrate, the glutamate side-chain carboxylate oxygen atoms are near C2 and O2 and the O1 atom binds in oxyanion hole 2, favoring the exchange of the C2 proton. The extent of this stabilizing interaction for the catalysis can only be quantified by further studies, for example by quantum mechanical calculations and by characterization of TIM variants in which Asn11 has been mutated. It remains to be seen whether the intermediate of the catalysed isomerization reaction is the protonated enol form or the charged enolate form (Fig. 1). Atomic resolution structures of various complexes, possibly showing the protonation state of the histidine, glutamate, and the ligand, could clarify this aspect. Such studies have been initiated using these leishmania TIM crystals.
