ABSTRACT: The crystal structure of the flavoprotein NADH peroxidase shows that the Arg303 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the active-site His10 imidazole and is therefore likely to influence the catalytic mechanism. Dithionite titration of an R303M mutant [E(FAD, Cys42-sulfenic acid)] yields a two-electron reduced intermediate (EH2) with enhanced flavin fluorescence and almost no charge-transfer absorbance at pH 7.0; the pKa for the nascent Cys42-SH is increased by over 3.5 units in comparison with the wildtype EH2 pKa of e4.5. NADH titration of the mutant peroxidase yields the same EH2 intermediate, but in contrast to the behavior of wild-type enzyme, this species can be reduced directly to an EH4,NAD+ complex. Kinetic analyses demonstrate that the R303M mutant is severely compromised, although active, with kcat ) 3 s-1 at pH 7.0, 5 °C; enzyme-monitored turnover results indicate that the steady-state consists predominantly of an E-FADH2,NAD+ species. When the oxidized mutant is reacted anaerobically with 0.9 equiv of NADH/FAD, a clearly biphasic pattern is observed at 450 nm; relatively rapid flavin reduction is followed by reoxidation at 2.6-2.7 s-1 (kcat). Thus replacement of Arg303 with Met leads to an altered peroxidase form in which the rate-limiting step in turnover is the intramolecular transfer of electrons from FADH2 f Cys42-SOH. The crystal structure of the R303M peroxidase has been refined at 2.45 Å resolution. In addition to eliminating the Arg303 interactions with His10 and Glu14, the mutant exhibits a significant change in the conformation of the Cys42-SOH side chain relative to FAD and His10 in particular. These and other results provide a detailed understanding of Arg303 and its role in the structure and mechanism of this unique flavoprotein peroxidase.

Although over 40 years have passed since its original identification by Dolin (1), the flavoprotein NADH peroxidase (Npx;1 NADH + H+ + H2O2 f NAD+ + 2H2O) remains the only known FAD- (or FMN-) dependent per This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant GM-35394.

oxidase (2, 3). Crystal structures have been reported for the inactive Cys42-SO3H derivative and its complex with NADH (4, 5) and for several active-site mutants including the C42S, C42A, and S41C proteins (6, 7) as well as the L40C mutant, which forms an active-site disulfide between Cys40-SH and the native Cys42-SOH redox center. Mande et al. (6) were the first to observe a hydrogen bond between Arg303 N1 and His10 N1; as a result, it was concluded that His10 is very likely to remain unprotonated throughout the catalytic cycle. Subsequent studies with His10 mutants (8) have supported this conclusion. While the neutral His10 N 2-H tautomer stabilized by the interaction with Arg303 plays important roles in the stabilization of both the Cys42-SOH redox center in the resting enzyme and the transition state for peroxide reduction by Cys42-S-, it is not an essential acid-base catalyst. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the replacement of Arg303 with Met in an HHAA peroxidase mutant retaining His10 and His23 (9) had no significant effect on the 13C His NMR spectrum of the labeled protein over the pH range 6.0-8.0. As also described by Mande et al. (6), Arg303 forms a salt bridge with Glu14; Stehle et al. (4) originally identified this interaction as a component of the "domain zipper" linking the N-terminal FAD-binding and

There is also an interesting interaction observed originally in the Cys42 mutant structures between Arg303 N1 and the aromatic ring of Tyr60, which was interpreted as an example of hydrogen bonding between the Arg303 primary amino group and the  electrons of the benzene ring. More recently, we have described the active-site structures of the native Cys42-SOH forms of both wild-type and H10Q Npx at 2.1 and 2.4 Å, respectively (3). While the presence of a hydrogen bond between Arg303 and His10 is clearly indicated in the wild-type structure, the conformation of the Arg303 side chain has changed from that seen in the Cys42 mutants such that Arg303 N , not N1, interacts (3.0 Å) with His10 N1. In the H10Q mutant, the guanidinium moiety of Arg303 is completely flipped relative to the wild-type conformation. In comparing the Arg303 conformations of the Cys42-SOH and C42S forms of Npx, it appeared that the observed side chain movement could be of catalytic significance, especially since the Ser42 side chain is an isosteric equivalent of the Cys42-SH present in the Npx EH2 intermediate. In addition, the refined 2.5 Å crystal structure2 of the Streptococcus pyogenes NADH oxidase C44S mutant (Nox; 2NADH + 2H+ + O2 f 2NAD+ + 2H2O), a close structural and mechanistic homologue of Npx, demonstrates that Arg303 of the peroxidase is replaced with Val314; this Val residue is conserved in all five known Nox sequences as either Val or Leu. This observation suggests that Arg303 may play a critical role in determining peroxidase versus oxidase function as well. In this report we present a detailed analysis of the kinetic and redox properties of the Npx R303M mutant, and we also describe the crystal structure for this protein, refined at 2.45 Å resolution. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials and General Methods. NADH was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and AcPyADH and phenosafranin were from Sigma. (4S)-[4-1H]- and (4S)-[4-2H]NADH were prepared as described previously (10); all other chemicals were purchased from sources given earlier (11) and were of the best grades available. NADH peroxidase activity was routinely measured using the established procedure (12). Spectral titrations were carried out with HewlettPackard model 8452A and Beckman DU 7500 diode-array spectrophotometers and with an SLM AB2 spectrofluorimeter; procedures for anaerobiosis have been described (11). E° for the R303M peroxidase EH2/EH4 redox couple was determined by dithionite titration in the presence of the reference dye phenosafranin (E° ) -252 mV; ref 13), using methyl viologen at low concentration to ensure rapid equilibration of reducing equivalents (11). Stopped-Flow Measurements. The Applied Photophysics DX.17 MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer, equipped with a photodiode-array detector and Acorn 32 bit RISC-processor workstation (14, 15), was thermostated at 5 °C and used (1) to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters for R303M Npx from initial rates of NADH and AcPyADH oxidation, (2) to perform spectral and kinetic enzyme-monitored turnover analyses, including the primary deuterium kinetic

Crane et al. isotope effects on both the approach to steady state and turnover, (3) to analyze the kinetic and spectral events during reduction to the EH2 and EH4,NAD+ forms and on oxidation of EH2 with H2O2, and (4) to determine the pKa for Cys42SH in the R303M Npx EH2 form. These analyses involved single-wavelength absorbance (NADH, AcPyADH, or enzyme), fluorescence emission at a fixed excitation wavelength (NADH or enzyme), and diode-array measurements (enzyme), as described previously. A standard buffer of 50 mM potassium phosphate, 0.1 M potassium acetate, pH 7.0, plus 0.5 mM EDTA was used in all spectral titrations and routine stopped-flow experiments. Steady-state kinetic parameters for NADH and H2O2 at pH 7.0, 5 °C, were determined by measuring initial rates of NADH oxidation (10) when buffered enzyme was mixed in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer with substrate solutions (final concentrations of 1-77 µM NADH, 1-40 mM H2O2, and 25 nM Npx). At [NADH]s e20 µM oxidation was monitored by the decrease in fluorescence (EX ) 340 nm), using an emission cutoff filter which allowed transmission of light at  > 385 nm; for each set of measurements a standard curve was constructed to allow the conversion of fluorescence units to [NADH]. These standard curves also demonstrated that fluorescence intensity was linearly proportional to [NADH] over the range 0-20 µM (A340 ) 0-0.12). At [NADH]s > 20 µM initial rates were measured from the decrease in A340. In all cases, the initial velocities reported represent the averages from four individual traces and are corrected for Npx-catalyzed NADH oxidation in the absence of H2O2. Kinetic parameters were determined using ENZFITTER, as previously described (10). The pKa for Cys42-SH in the R303M Npx EH2 form was determined at 5 °C by mixing EH2 (23 µM before mixing, in 7.5 mM phosphate, pH 7.0) with 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0; 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 7.8, and 8.3; and 0.1 M CHES, pH 8.7 and 9.0, in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer and measuring the amplitude of the absorbance increase at 560 nm. Final pH values were measured in controls at 25 °C and corrected for the change in temperature. All buffers contained 0.5 mM EDTA. As required, the stopped-flow system was prepared for anaerobic work as previously described (14). Stopped-flow analyses of enzyme-monitored turnover (16) and E f EH2 reduction consisted of both single-wavelength (primarily 450 and 660 nm) and diode-array data sets, and the Pro-Kineticist (Pro-K; Applied Photophysics) software was used for global analysis of these data, including calculations of intermediate spectra (14). The reductions of E and EH2 f EH4,NAD+ were monitored only by diodearray detection, and in these cases, rate constants were estimated by analyzing the entire data set at selected wavelengths of 450 and 750 nm. For calculations of intermediate spectra sequential mechanisms of the type A f B f C, etc., were employed, where species A was represented by the starting spectrum of the free E (or EH2, respectively) form of R303M Npx. In analyzing the specific reaction of E with 5 equiv of (4S)-[4-2H]NADH, however, the dead-time spectrum corresponding to A was also calculated. In this case, 400 absorbance spectra were collected in a linear time base from 3.8 ms to 2 s. Protein Purification and Crystallization. The R303M mutation was generated in the plasmid pNPR4 (17), and the final pR303M expression plasmid was checked by both

The anaerobic cuvette contained 19.5 µM enzyme (FAD) in 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.0, with 0.5 mM EDTA.

sequence and restriction analysis. The mutant protein was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli JM109(DE3) using the procedure developed for recombinant wild-type Npx; crystals of R303M Npx were obtained by the vapor diffusion method under ambient conditions, using solutions containing 2-8% PEG 400, 1.6-1.9 M (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 M sodium HEPES, pH 7.2, with protein concentrations of 7.5-10 mg/mL. Large single, yellow prisms were seen after 3-5 days, and these continued to grow for about one more week. At this stage, crystals were either prepared directly for data collection or stored under argon to limit exposure to oxygen, thus stabilizing Cys42-SOH against oxidation to the inactive Cys42-SO2H/-SO3H forms (18). Crystals were frozen at 110 K using 30% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant; flash-dipping the crystal into artificial mother liquor containing ethylene glycol, then freezing it directly under the nitrogen cold stream, resulted in a successful freezing protocol. R303M Npx crystallized in space group I4122 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Data Collection and Refinement. Synchrotron data were collected from a single crystal at Stanford Synchrotron Research Laboratory beamline 7-1; crystal decay was virtually eliminated under the cryogenic conditions employed, as indicated by the image scale factors used during processing. Data were processed in DENZO and scaled in SCALEPACK (19); data statistics, cell dimensions, and resolution for the R303M Npx crystals are given in Table 1. The refinement protocol used for the R303M Npx structure was essentially identical to that employed for the H10Q and H10A mutants;3 the starting model in each case was the 2.8 Å native Cys42-SOH structure of wild-type Npx.

of pure R303M enzyme from 5 L of E. coli cultures. As with the wild-type and His10 mutant (8) proteins, the fluorescence of the tightly bound FAD is strongly quenched in R303M Npx. The visible absorption spectra of the recombinant wild-type (max ) 380, 450 nm; 450 ) 10 900 M-1 cm-1) and R303M mutant (max ) 380, 453 nm; 453 ) 10 600 M-1 cm-1) Npxs are very similar; the absorbance ratio at 280 and 450 nm for both enzymes is 7.8. There is no obvious indication from the visible absorbance spectrum that R303M Npx purifies as a mixture of E and EH2 forms, as was observed with both wild-type and H10Q proteins, nor does the R303M mutant as purified exhibit the enhanced long-wavelength absorbance band attributed to Cys42-SOH f FAD charge-transfer in the oxidized His10 mutants. ReductiVe Titrations. Anaerobic dithionite titration of the R303M mutant at pH 7.0 proceeds in two distinct phases, consistent with the presence of functional Cys42-SOH and FAD redox centers (Figure 1). Surprisingly, however, completion of the first phase with 1 equiv of dithionite/FAD does not give rise to the strong EH2 charge-transfer band (Cys42-S- f FAD; max  540 nm) seen with wild-type and His10 mutant Npxs. There are small but significant changes in the 380 and 450 nm absorbance maxima, but these appear to represent a simple perturbation of the flavin environment on reduction of Cys42-SOH f Cys42-SH rather than the altered electronic state associated with a chargetransfer interaction. Another very significant difference in the behavior of R303M Npx during the first phase of this titration concerns the very slow intramolecular transfer of reducing equivalents within the EH2 intermediate observed transiently on each addition of dithionite. This process, which was followed as a slow reappearance of the starting A450, requires 1 h for completion under stringent anaerobic conditions at pH 7.0, 25 °C. In all other Npx forms studied to date (7, 8, 17), the direct reduction of E f EH2 has been observed in spectral titrations with dithionite or NADH. Another surprising observation was made when the dithionite titration described above was followed by fluorescence (EX ) 450 nm, EM ) 535 nm), as shown in Figure

Crane et al. Cys42-S- f FAD charge-transfer interaction and is similar in intensity to that seen with 1 equiv of dithionite/FAD. More surprisingly, titration of this EH2 form with an additional 1.3 equiv of NADH/FAD leads directly to complete flavin reduction; this process results in the appearance of a stable EH4,NAD+ complex as indicated by the intense chargetransfer band centered at 765 nm. Similar redox behavior has been observed before with Npx, but only in the C42S, C42A, and L40C mutants which lack the Cys42-SOH center (7, 11). NADH titration of the wild-type Npx EH2 form does lead to partial A450 bleaching as well as an increase in 750 nm absorbance, but this has previously been attributed to quantitative formation of an EH2,NADH complex (10). While this point will be considered in detail in Discussion, it is clear that the stoichiometric EH4,NAD+ complex formation observed with R303M Npx on addition of 2 equiv of NADH/FAD is much greater than the extent of any EH2 reduction seen with wild-type Npx under identical conditions. To examine this unusual thermodynamic property of the R303M Npx EH2 species further, a similar titration was carried out with AcPyADH (E° ) -248 mV, or 72 mV higher than NADH; ref 21). As shown in Figure 2, the AcPyADH titration also leads to the stoichiometric (1.9 equiv of AcPyADH/FAD) reduction of R303M E f EH4, AcPyAD+, despite the much higher potential for the free pyridine nucleotide. The absorbance maximum for the AcPyAD+ complex is blue-shifted 25 nm (to 740 nm), and there is an 50% increase in 740 (4500 M-1 cm-1) compared to 765 for the NAD+ complex (3100 M-1 cm-1). The EH2 intermediate observed with 1 equiv of AcPyADH is spectrally identical to that seen with NADH, on the other hand. Taken together, these results indicate that the redox potential for the R303M Npx EH2/EH4 couple, while it is not the only factor responsible for the altered behavior observed with pyridine nucleotides, may be increased significantly relative to that of wild-type Npx (E° ) -312 mV for EH2/EH4; ref 10). This was tested directly by measuring the EH2/EH4 potential for R303M Npx by dithionite titration in the presence of the reference dye phenosafranin (E° ) -252 mV). Reductions of the reference dye and enzyme (EH2 form) were monitored at 520 and 404 nm, respectively. Following this procedure, a redox potential of -261 mV was determined for the R303M Npx EH2/EH4 couple; the plot of log [EH2]/[EH4] versus log[dyeox]/[dyered] has a slope of 0.9. The EH2/EH4 potential for R303M Npx is thus 51 mV more positive than that for wild-type enzyme, which is generally consistent with the more facile reductions by NADH and AcPyADH. Still, other important factors such as the preferential binding of the oxidized pyridine nucleotide products to EH4 must contribute significantly to this altered behavior. The dithionite titration data for R303M Npx also indicate that the potential for the EH2/EH4 couple must be at least 82 mV lower than that for reduction of E f EH2; from this it follows that the potential for the Cys42-SOH/ Cys42-SH couple is g-179 mV. pKa for Cys42-SH in R303M EH2 Form. One explanation for the absence of a significant EH2 charge-transfer band in R303M Npx would be a shift in the pKa for Cys42-SH from the unusually low value of e4.5 found in the wild-type EH2 form (at 25 °C; ref 12) toward a more normal Cys-SH pKa (22). Initial attempts to determine whether increasing pH led

(A) In order of increasing A765, the spectra shown correspond to oxidized enzyme [(s) 21.6 µM, treated as described in Figure 1] and enzyme after addition of 0.9 (- - -), 1.42 (- , -), 1.85 (- - -), and 3.27 (s) equiv of NADH/FAD. (B) In order of increasing A740, spectra correspond to oxidized enzyme [(s) 40.6 µM, treated as described above] and enzyme after addition of 0.84 (- - -), 1.19 (- , -), 1.39 (- - -), 1.67 (- , , , -), and 2.4 (s) equiv of AcPyADH/FAD. The oxygen-scrubbing system consisting of protocatechuate dioxygenase and protocatechuic acid was added anaerobically prior to each titration.

1. While the oxidized enzyme exhibits only 1-2% of the fluorescence intensity of free FAD at the same concentration, reduction of E f EH2 is associated with a distinctive 6-7fold increase in fluorescence. The enhanced quantum yield for the EH2 form of R303M Npx is similar to that reported for the oxidized C42S, C42A, and L40C mutants (7, 11). There is no evidence for any kinetic or thermodynamic stabilization of flavin semiquinone during either phase of the titration, and addition of 1.3 equiv of dithionite/FAD to the R303M EH2 intermediate leads directly to the fully reduced EH4 species. The distinct absorbance maximum at 355 nm is consistent with stabilization of the N(1)-anionic form of FADH2, as seen with the wild-type enzyme (20). As expected, the reduction of the R303M Npx EH2 form to EH4 (FAD f FADH2) in the second phase of the dithionite titration also results in the loss of flavin fluorescence. As shown in Figure 2 anaerobic NADH titration of R303M Npx also occurs in two distinct phases; the first requires 1 equiv of reductant/FAD and results in an EH2 intermediate indistinguishable from that observed with dithionite, both in terms of its absorbance spectrum and enhanced fluorescence. The small increase in long-wavelength absorbance beyond 500 nm could be consistent with a very weak

Spectra shown correspond to EH2 (11.5 µM after mixing at 5 °C) at pH 7.0 (s) and 9.2 (- - -). Inset: Change in A560 versus pH. The titration curve yields a pKa value of 8.2.

to enhanced EH2 charge-transfer involved anaerobic tips to different buffers. While this method was successful in a limited sense, we modified this approach by performing pHjump measurements with the R303M EH2 form in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer at 5 °C. As shown in Figure 3, the pKa determined for Cys42-SH from the absorbance change at 560 nm is 8.2. Although the replacement of His10 with Gln or Ala has no significant effect on the pKa for Cys42-SH (8), substitution of Met for Arg303 results in a g3.7 unit increase. The much more favorable comparison between the mutant pKa of 8.2 and the value of 9.1 reported by Tanford for Cys-SH (at 25 °C, as corrected for charged -NH3+ and -CO2- groups; ref 22) suggests that Arg303 plays a major role in increasing the acidity of Cys42-SH in the wild-type Npx EH2 species. Enzyme-Monitored TurnoVer and Steady-State Kinetics of R303M Npx. One concern prior to measuring initial rates of NADH oxidation with R303M Npx was based on the pronounced sensitivity of H10Q Npx to H2O2 inactivation, which results from peroxide oxidation of Cys42-SOH f Cys42-SO2H/-SO3H (8). As measured from the time-dependent loss of activity at several [H2O2]s, however, the second-order rate constant for H2O2 inactivation of R303M Npx is only 1.4 M-1 min-1 at 25 °C, or 5-fold less than the wild-type inactivation rate constant. In addition, changes in the visible absorbance spectrum of the mutant enzyme were observed during inactivation that resemble those seen with wild-type Npx (23), and there was an associated increase in flavin fluorescence. When the R303M mutant was assayed under standard conditions with a recording spectrophotometer at 25 °C (pH 5.4, 0.16 mM NADH, 1-2 mM H2O2), initial rates corresponding to turnover numbers (as corrected for NADH oxidase activity) only 1-2% that of wild-type enzyme were obtained. These initial rates were linear for <1 min, and the NADH oxidase activity measured in the absence of H2O2, although unchanged from that of wild-type Npx, necessitated significant corrections. Under these conditions, however, it was determined that Km(H2O2) for R303M Npx was increased dramatically relative to wild-type enzyme. At pH 5.4,

Km(H2O2) ) 5.7 mM [kcat ) 8.2 s-1; kcat/Km(H2O2) ) 1.4 × 103 M-1 s-1]; at 25 °C, these values contrast with Km(H2O2) ) 0.13 mM and kcat ) 123 s-1 at pH 5.5 [kcat/Km(H2O2) ) 9.5 × 105 M-1 s-1] for wild-type Npx (17). The specificity constant for H2O2 is reduced by 700-fold in the mutant. To allow direct comparisons with stopped-flow half-reaction measurements, these analyses were repeated in detail at 5 °C as described in the Experimental Procedures. The pH 7.0 steady-state kinetic parameters for R303M Npx are summarized in Table 2 with those for wild-type and H10Q enzymes. When 21 µM R303M Npx (final concentration) was mixed in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer with 0.21 mM NADH and 40 mM H2O2, the enzyme rapidly approached a steady state (16, 24) characterized by a predominant E-FADH2, NAD+ component, as monitored at 450 and 660 nm. NADH oxidation continued until this substrate was exhausted at 5 s, although the A340 trace was not strictly linear. Integration of the A450 data set (16) gives kcat ) 2 s-1, which agrees well with the steady-state value of 3 s-1 determined as described above. The spectral properties of the enzyme in turnover and the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect were examined under similar conditions with (4S)-[4-1H]and (4S)-[4-2H]NADH. When analyzed at 450 and 660 nm with 80 µM (4S)-[4-1H]NADH and 14.6 µM enzyme in the presence of 40 mM H2O2 (Figure 4), the rapid approach to steady state corresponds to kapp ) 196 s-1, and the enzyme absorbance spectrum measured during steady-state turnover (max 770 nm with reduced A450) is very similar to that of the EH4,NAD+ complex observed in static titrations. When the same experiment is performed, but with 80 µM (4S)-[4-2H]NADH, the approach to steady state is best analyzed as a biphasic process with rate constants of 222 and 37 s-1. Similar E-FADH2,NAD+ spectral intermediates are observed with both substrates, suggesting that the primary ratelimiting step in turnover is isotope-insensitive; we should add that since both EH2 and EH4 redox states are expected to exhibit similar absorbance spectra, specific identification of either form in steady-state turnover is not implied at this point. Integration of the enzyme-monitored turnover data sets at 450 nm yields values for kcat ) 2.3 and 1.8 s-1 with (4S)[4-1H]- and (4S)-[4-2H]NADH, respectively; VH/VD for R303M Npx is therefore 1.3, significantly less than the values of 2.3-4.3 determined for wild-type and His10 mutant enzymes (8). Both the VH/VD value and the predominance of an E-FADH2,NAD+ intermediate during steady-state turnover are consistent with a change in rate-limiting step for R303M Npx relative to the wild-type enzyme.

observed with wild-type Npx (10), is not rate limiting with R303M Npx. To evaluate this conclusion further, enzymemonitored turnover analyses were performed with R303M enzyme and AcPyADH. A preliminary experiment measuring initial rates of AcPyADH oxidation indicated that kcat ) 0.1 s-1 and Km(H2O2) ) 0.1 mM (at 66 µM AcPyADH; corrected for oxidase activity) at pH 7.0, 5 °C. The 30-fold decrease in kcat and the longer reaction time required in enzymemonitored turnover presented a technical problem due to the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 by the otherwise undetectable amounts of E. coli catalase present in the R303M Npx preparation. It has been shown previously, however, that azide can be used to inhibit this catalase activity without effect on Npx (10). When 30.3 µM R303M Npx (final concentration) was mixed with 0.14 mM AcPyADH and 2 mM H2O2 in the presence of 0.2 mM azide, the spectral course of turnover proceeded as given in Figure 5. Unlike NADH oxidation traces at 340 nm in similar experiments, AcPyADH oxidation led to A364 traces that yielded linear rates for 10 s; the corresponding turnover number of 0.1 s-1 agrees very well with that from the preliminary determination described above. As with (4S)-[4-2H]NADH, two rate constants of 158 and 41 s-1 were required to describe the approach to steady state with AcPyADH at both 450 and 660 nm. An E-FADH2,AcPyAD+ complex (max ) 755 nm) dominates the spectrum of the enzyme in steady-state turnover, suggesting that a similar rate-limiting step applies for both NADH and AcPyADH; the magnitude of this rate constant seems, however, to be sensitive to the bound pyridine nucleotide.

FIGURE 6: Stopped-flow analysis of the NADH reduction of R303M Npx E f EH2. 9.7 µM oxidized enzyme (final concentration, in the standard pH 7.0 phosphate/acetate buffer at 5 °C) was mixed anaerobically with 9 µM NADH, and the reaction was monitored in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer (A) at 450 and 660 nm, and (B) at fluorescence emission wavelengths > 510 nm (EX ) 450 nm).

Reduction of R303M E f EH2. The observation of an E-FADH2,NAD+ complex during steady-state turnover suggests that either intramolecular electron transfer from FADH2 f Cys42-SOH (EH2 f EH2) or the reoxidation of EH4 with H2O2 (EH4 f EH2) is a component of the rate-limiting step with the R303M mutant. To examine the first possibility, the spectral and kinetic properties of the reduction of E f EH2 with 0.9 equiv of NADH were examined. Figure 6 gives the result of an experiment in which the changes in absorbance at 450 and 660 nm were followed along with fluorescence (EX ) 450 nm, EM > 510 nm) at 9.7 µM enzyme. The reaction is clearly biphasic to at least 1 s,

R303M Mutant of Enterococcal NADH Peroxidase exhibiting a decrease in A450 (a lag in the fluorescence trace) followed by an increase in both A450 and fluorescence. Careful analysis reveals that four rate constants are required to interpret the full 10 s traces at both 450 and 660 nm. The decrease in A450 is biphasic, with rate constants of 77 and 22 s-1. The major component of the A450 increase corresponds to k ) 2.7 s-1 (kcat), while the slow phase (kslow ) 0.1 s-1) is not catalytically competent. This noncatalytic component accounts for about 20% of the total increase in A450 and is consistently seen in the fluorescence traces as well, as EH2 is formed. The fluorescence data also give k ) 3 s-1 (kcat) for the third phase in reduction of E f EH2, which accounts for over 80% of the total fluorescence increase. This increase in fluorescence and the regain of A450, both at 2.7-3 s-1, provide strong evidence for the transient formation of an EH2,NAD+ species on reaction of R303M Npx with stoichiometric NADH. The subsequent intramolecular electron-transfer step corresponds to the conversion of EH2,NAD+ f EH2 and appears to be rate limiting in turnover as well. In a parallel experiment the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect on the reduction of E f EH2 was investigated. The data set obtained with 0.9 equiv of (4S)-[4-1H]NADH (14.6 µM enzyme) gives rate constants of 84, 24, and 2.6 s-1 for the reaction sequence at both 450 and 660 nm as described above; analysis of the noncatalytic component gives kslow ) 0.2 s-1. With 0.9 equiv of (4S)-[4-2H]NADH a very similar reaction sequence is observed, but with rate constants of 46, 25, and 2.4 s-1 for the three catalytically competent phases. While the event attributed to reduction of E f EH2 is isotope-sensitive (kH/kD ) 1.8), the intramolecular electron-transfer step (EH2 f EH2; kH/kD ) 1.1) is not. These results fully support the interpretation that the major component of the decrease in A450 (85% of the total amplitude change) observed at 84 s-1 with NADH is due to flavin reduction, and that the rate-limiting step in turnover is the subsequent transfer of electrons to Cys42-SOH at 2.6 s-1. The diode-array data set obtained with NADH was then analyzed in conjunction with the rate constants determined from these single-wavelength measurements in order to calculate the absorbance spectra of the two catalytic intermediates. These are shown in Figure 7, and both spectra are indicative of E-FADH2,NAD+ complexes. These spectral and kinetic results are consistent with the overall scheme.

FIGURE 7: Calculated absorption spectra for intermediates B and C in the NADH reduction of R303M Npx E f EH2. The reduction of E f EH2 was analyzed in an experiment very similar to that described in Figure 6, but with 14.6 µM R303M Npx and 12.3 µM NADH. The entire 10 s, 100 spectrum data set from this diodearray experiment was analyzed as described in the Experimental Procedures and Results, using the rate constants for the three-step model described in the text. The spectrum shown for the starting oxidized enzyme (s) is taken directly from the diode-array data set. Additional spectra shown were calculated for intermediate B (- , -), intermediate C (- - -), and the final EH2 form (- - -).

The chemical distinction between (EH2,NAD+)* and EH2, NAD+ forms is not clear at present, but it does not involve either further reduction to EH4, dissociation of NAD+, or any slower reducing component of oxidized enzyme; there is no kinetic isotope effect on the conversion of (EH2, NAD+)* f EH2,NAD+, and there is only a slight decrease in 775 during this step. In addition, both forms are essentially nonfluorescent. As described above, kcat for R303M Npx with AcPyADH is only 0.1 s-1, or 30-fold less than with the natural substrate. The finding that the intramolecular transfer of electrons from

FADH2 f Cys42-SOH is rate limiting with NADH was taken to suggest that this process might be sensitive to the nature of the pyridine nucleotide bound to EH2. When R303M Npx was reacted with 0.7 equiv of AcPyADH/FAD an EH2,AcPyAD+ spectral intermediate very similar to that observed in steady-state turnover (max ) 745 nm) appears; this species is converted to EH2 in a biphasic process with rate constants of 0.2 and 0.05 s-1. It therefore appears that the rate-limiting intramolecular electron transfer is slowed significantly within the AcPyAD+ complex, as compared to the rate constant of 2.6-2.7 s-1 measured with NADH. Furthermore, both rate constants measured on conversion of EH2,AcPyAD+ f EH2 differ by only 2-fold from kcat with AcPyADH and could represent catalytic steps. Reduction of R303M E f EH4,NAD+. When the reduction of R303M Npx with 5.2 equiv of NADH (76 µM final concentration) was monitored by diode-array detection, the observed rate constant for formation of the EH2,NAD+ intermediate was increased to about 240 s-1. A well-resolved slow phase with a rate constant of 4-5 s-1 (kcat of 3 s-1) led to the final EH4,NAD+ species, as limited presumably by the conversion of EH2,NAD+ f EH2. Further support for this interpretation comes from analysis of the reaction of the preformed R303M EH2 intermediate with 5 equiv of NADH; in this case monophasic flavin reduction occurs with a kobs value of about 280 s-1 and yields the EH4,NAD+ complex directly. When the reaction of R303M Npx was analyzed with 5.2 equiv of (4S)-[4-2H]NADH the two-electron reduction of EH2,NAD+ f EH4,NAD+ was again limited by the formation of EH2 at 4.1 s-1; there is no isotope effect on this step (kH/kD ) 1.1). As expected, however, the kobs value for EH2, NAD+ formation was isotope-sensitive. When the entire diode-array data set of 400 spectra was analyzed with the kinetic scheme,

Crane et al. usually required (4, 18). The final R303M Npx model meets the geometric criteria applied with the program PROCHECK (26), and the rms deviations in bond lengths and angles are given in Table 1 along with the mean coordinate error. Both the latter value and the overall B-factor (0.25 Å and 39 Å2, respectively) are higher than observed in the wild-type structure (0.15 Å and 20.7 Å2; ref 18), suggesting a greater degree of inherent disorder in the R303M mutant. Superimposition of the two structures reveals, however, that the mutation does not give rise to any domain movements or rearrangements; the overall tertiary structures remain very similar. To visualize the differences in active-site structures for the wild-type and R303M Npxs, the CR coordinates for the two proteins were superimposed using the least-squares method of Kabsch (27). As shown in Figure 9, the mutant structure confirms the presence of Met303, and Cys42-SOH is stabilized as a result of the cryogenic conditions employed in data collection. As Arg303 in wild-type Npx interacts with both His10 and Glu14, we first analyzed the environment of Met303. The closest approach of any Met303 side chain atom to either His10 N1 or Glu14 O 1 is 3.8 Å, and the position of Met303 C is displaced 3.0 Å from its N equivalent in the Arg303 side chain. Similarly, there are no interactions between Met303 and Tyr60. In view of the potential disruption of the domain zipper described by Stehle et al. (4), a water molecule (Wat131) assumes the role of linking His10 N1 (2.8 Å) and Glu14 O 1 (3.0 Å); this water is displaced by Arg303 in the wild-type structure. The loss of Arg303 does induce compensating changes in the sidechain conformations of Glu14 and Arg307 involving displacements of 0.7-1.0 Å in the respective -O 2 and -N2 positions, but the salt bridge joining these two residues is maintained. There is almost no change in the orientation of the His10 side chain in the R303M mutant. In view of the somewhat dramatic functional changes introduced by the R303M mutation, it should be emphasized that the 2.1 Å structure of wild-type Npx indicates that no element of the Arg303 guanidinium moiety is located within 7 Å of the Cyo42-SO function.3 Nonetheless, there is a dramatic change in the Cyo42 side-chain conformation in the mutant relative to wild-type Npx. Even taking into consideration the greater degree of inherent disorder indicated for this mutant structure and the larger rms coordinate error, the displacements for Cyo42 S and O are 0.9 and 1.6 Å, respectively. As opposed to the essentially parallel arrangement indicated for the Cyo42 side chain and the FAD isoalloxazine in wild-type Npx (3, 18), the Cyo42-SO function of the mutant adopts an "out" conformation that appears to involve a major rotation of the C -S bond. This positions Cyo42 O further from the isoalloxazine ring; while the distances to FAD C(10a), N(1), and C(4a) in wild-type Npx are 3.3-3.5 Å, Cyo42 O is 4.0-4.5 Å from these loci in the mutant. As a consequence the SO oxygen is in a position to form hydrogen bonds with FAD O2 (2.9 Å) and His10 N 2 (3.2 Å) as well as Cyo42 N (2.9 Å). The accompanying slight rotation about the CR-C bond also has the effect of bringing Cys42 S closer to FAD C(4a), C(10a), and N(5) (now separated by 3.1-3.5 Å) and other elements of the flavin redox center.

FIGURE 8: Calculated absorption spectra for intermediates in the reduction of R303M Npx E f EH4,NAD+ with (4S)-[4-2H]NADH. The reduction of 14.6 µM oxidized enzyme with 75.5 µM (4S)[4-2H]NADH (final concentrations) was analyzed under anaerobic conditions very similar to those described for Figure 7. The data set of 400 diode-array spectra was used as described in both the Experimental Procedures and Results to calculate the absorption spectra for species A (s), intermediate B (- , -), and for the final EH4,NAD+ form (- - -). The kinetic scheme used in this analysis is presented in the text.

the calculated dead-time absorbance spectrum for species A (Figure 8) is clearly that of the R303M E,NADD complex, with an oxidized max ) 449 nm, a resolved shoulder at 471 nm, and a strong NADD f FAD charge-transfer band centered at 580 nm. The E,NADH complex of wild-type Npx, for example, has an oxidized max of 450 nm, with a strong shoulder at 468 nm and a charge-transfer band centered at 560 nm (10).

EH4,NAD+ + H2O2 f EH2,NAD+ + H2O EH2,NAD+ f EH2 + NAD+ + H2O EH2 + H2O2 f E + H2O
However, we have also shown that the R303M EH2 species is rapidly reduced to EH4,NAD+ in the presence of excess NADH; under standard assay conditions, with both substrates present at saturating concentrations [and in consideration of the Km(H2O2) value of 6.4 mM for this mutant], the extent of direct EH2 participation in H2O2 reduction will depend on the relative rates of NADH reduction versus H2O2 oxidation. Given the instability observed with the mutant EH2 form at higher pH values, we analyzed the reaction of 9.2 µM EH2 with H2O2 by fluorescence at pH 7.0, 5 °C. Data averaged from 6 to 8 individual traces at each of several [H2O2]s ranging from 0.1 to 50 mM were biphasic, but kfast represented almost 90% of the total F throughout the [H2O2] range. A double-reciprocal plot of kfast versus [H2O2] (25) yielded values for Kd(H2O2) and kox of 2.5 mM and 310 s-1, respectively,

DISCUSSION Rate-Limiting Step in Catalysis is Changed in R303M Npx. The catalytic mechanism proposed for wild-type Npx (10) on the basis of combined steady-state and stopped-flow kinetic analyses consists of a pre-steady-state priming step in which oxidized enzyme is reduced with 1 equiv of NADH; the resulting EH2 species is a central catalytic intermediate,

EH2 + NADH 9 EH2,NADH* 8 8 EH2,NADH* + H2O2 9 E,NADH + H2O 8 E,NADH + H+ 9 EH2,NAD+ + H2O EH2,NAD+ 9 EH2 + NAD+ 8
The E,NADH complex was identified by diode-array analyses of the enzyme during steady-state turnover; its spectral properties are very similar to those of the E(Cys42-SO3H), NADH complex of Npx (23) as well as the NADPH complexes described for C47S (28) and oxidized EHR(Cys63-SO3H; ref 29) forms of E. coli and yeast GR, respectively. Stopped-flow analysis did not identify any discrete E-FADH2 intermediate with wild-type Npx in either reductive half-reaction or enzyme-monitored turnover experiments, and a primary deuterium isotope effect of 3.0 was measured on the conversion of E,NADH f EH2. This hydride transfer step is essentially rate limiting in turnover and accounts almost quantitatively for the pH dependence of kcat, which exhibits an acidic optimum but decreases sharply above pH 6.5, with an apparent pKa of 6.9 for some activity-limiting ionization within the E,NADH complex. This pKa does not correspond to the active-site His10, since His10 mutants exhibit essentially identical kcat values and kcat versus pH profiles as wild-type Npx (8).

In contrast to the E,NADH intermediate which dominates the steady-state turnover spectrum of wild-type Npx, the R303M mutant provides direct evidence for an E-FADH2 intermediate in the transfer of electrons from NADH to Cys42-SOH. The corresponding EH2,NAD+ complex is easily distinguished by its spectral properties (Figure 4A), and integration of enzyme-monitored turnover traces at 450 nm gives a value for kcat (2-2.3 s-1) very close to that determined (3 s-1) from initial rates of NADH oxidation. Furthermore, we have shown that this conversion of EH2, NAD+ f EH2 is the rate-limiting step in turnover, as demonstrated in reductive half-reaction analyses with 0.9 equiv of NADH; these experiments give values of 2.4-3 s-1 for the corresponding rate constant (Figures 6 and 7). Using (4S)-[4-2H]NADH we have shown that there is no primary deuterium isotope effect on this step, nor is there an isotope effect on turnover with R303M Npx. These observations, taken together with the spectral properties of the enzyme in steady-state turnover, clearly indicate that the E-FADH2 species is a true intermediate in Cys42-SOH reduction and that the R303M mutation introduces a change in the rate-limiting step in catalysis. By investigating the reduction of R303M Npx with a 5-fold excess of deuterated substrate (Figure 8), we were also able to demonstrate the dead-time formation of an E, NADD complex similar to that observed with the wild-type enzyme and NADH. Still, under otherwise identical conditions, the observed rate constant for hydride transfer to FAD (46 s-1) within the R303M E-FAD,NADD complex is faster than that for the comparable conversion of wild-type E-FAD, NADH f EH2 (23 s-1). Taken together, the spectral and kinetic results provide the following mechanistic scheme for the stoichiometric reduction of R303M Npx,

Crane et al. reoxidizes EH4 f EH2. Considering the present titration data with R303M Npx and both NADH and AcPyADH, which demonstrate direct formation of the EH4 complex with the respective pyridine nucleotide product (Figure 2), the longwavelength max values of 765 and 740 nm for these reduced enzyme forms support the revised interpretation that the EH2, NADH and AcPyADH complexes with wild-type Npx at pH 7.0 also contain significant EH4,NAD+ and EH4,AcPyAD+ components at equilibrium. In particular, the difference spectra beyond 500 nm accompanying these wild-type EH2 titrations (10) can now be interpreted as the combination of two effects: NADH (or AcPyADH) enhancement of EH2 charge-transfer over the range 500-650 nm, and E-FADH2, NAD+ (or AcPyAD+) charge-transfer absorbance from 650 to 800 nm. The effect of NADPH on EH2 thiolatefFAD charge-transfer absorbance has previously been described by Rietveld et al. (28) with GR, and the observation of an E-FADH2 f NAD+ charge-transfer band at 740 nm in the Npx C42S mutant (11) establishes the basis for the latter spectral component in both wild-type and R303M Npxs. In the present work we have also established that substitution of Met for Arg303 in Npx leads to a 51 mV increase (to -261 mV) in E° for the FAD/FADH2 couple. In the presence of one equiv of AcPyADH (E° ) -248 mV), however, the R303M EH2 form is quantitatively reduced to the EH4,AcPyAD+ species (Figure 2B). Rietveld et al. (28) have also suggested, on the basis of studies with E. coli GR Cys42 and Cys47 mutants, that the differential binding of pyridine nucleotide to E-FAD and E-FADH2 forms can have a strong influence on the corresponding flavin potential. Previous studies with the wild-type Npx EH2,AcPyADH complex (10), which were interpreted in light of the free solution potential for the pyridine nucleotide, were subject to this effect as well. In the context of the present analysis, we would also conclude that the conversion of EH2,NADH* f EH2,NADH measured at 570 nm with wild-type Npx is actually attributable to formation of the small amount of EH4, NAD+ component which is present at equilibrium. Equilibrium Properties of the Cys42-SOH/-SH Redox Center Are Altered in R303M Npx. The results with R303M Npx can also be compared with those of other Npx mutants in which Cys42 has either been replaced (C42S, C42A; ref 11) or oxidized to an active-site disulfide (L40C; ref 7). While oxidized R303M Npx retains only 1-2% of the fluorescence of free FAD, the fluorescence of these mutants (22% of free FAD with L40C) compares favorably with that of the R303M EH2 form. Visser et al. (30) have concluded that Cys42-SOH is probably responsible for the static fluorescence quenching observed in wild-type Npx; based on earlier studies with 8R-sulfur-linked flavin analogues in hydrogen-bonding solvents (31), it was shown that the observed fluorescence quenching was due to an interaction of the nonbonding electrons of Cys S with the isoalloxazine ring and the solvent. The increase in fluorescence observed on reduction of R303M Npx to its EH2 form (Cys42-SOH f Cys42-SH; Figures 1 and 6B) may therefore reflect a change in the S hydrogen-bonding pattern and/or a deviation from the rigid steric requirement intrinsic to the sulfur quenching in oxidized R303M. Another feature shared by the C42S, C42A, L40C, and R303M mutants is the fact that all are reduced directly with NADH (1 equiv/FAD for Cys42 and L40C mutants and 2 equiv/FAD for R303M) to the

In the presence of a 5-fold excess of NADH kobs is 240 s-1 for the reduction of E f (EH2,NAD+)*, and the EH2 species is rapidly reduced to the stable EH4,NAD+ form with an observed rate constant approaching 300 s-1. This EH4, NAD+ species is identical to the final R303M Npx form obtained in anaerobic titrations with 2 equiv of NADH/FAD (Figure 2A). Stopped-flow fluorescence analyses indicate that the kinetic mechanism for the EH2 reaction with H2O2 differs significantly from that with wild-type Npx, consistent with the dramatic increase in Km(H2O2) of nearly 500-fold observed on substitution of Met for Arg303. The irreversible second-order reaction demonstrated for the wild-type enzyme is replaced by a two-step mechanism,

A major factor in the mM Kd for the rapid equilibrium step derives from the increased pKa value for Cys42-SH; at pH 7.0 only 6% of the R303M EH2 form carries the Cys42-thiolate essential for peroxide reduction. EH4,NAD+ Redox States in Wild-Type and R303M Npxs. An additional aspect of the wild-type Npx mechanism (10) involves the distinction between the EH2,NADH* catalytic intermediate and the static EH2,NADH species identified in spectral titrations. The rate constant for conversion of EH2, NADH* f EH2,NADH (10 s-1) is less than kcat (23 s-1), indicating that the static species is not catalytically competent. Furthermore, this conversion (in the presence of 5 equiv of NADH/FAD) corresponds to decreases in both A450 and A570, suggestive of a significant E-FAD f E-FADH2 component. Static titrations revealed, however, that the conversions of EH2 f EH2,NADH and EH2,AcPyADH complexes exhibited isosbestic behavior throughout, and the same EH2,NADH complex was formed on titration of the Npx EH4 form with NAD+. More recently we have shown4 that back-titration of the static EH2,NADH complex with ferricyanide also leads to stoichiometric conversion to EH2 [2 equiv of Fe(CN)6-3 per FAD] in a similar isosbestic fashion. On the basis of these observations we concluded that these EH2 complexes did not reflect significant EH4 contributions. We also demonstrated (10) that the static EH2, NADH complex only very slowly approached a catalytically competent steady state, with kapp ) 4-5 s-1 versus 480520 s-1 for the E and EH2 forms, and its direct reoxidation by H2O2 was slower than turnover. The static EH2,NADH complex is, however, reactive toward oxygen (12); in contrast to the EH2 form, this indicates the presence of some equilibrium E-FADH2 component. Recent titrations of wild-type Npx4 with NADH in CHES buffer, pH 8.8, even indicate that the enzyme can be reduced completely to the EH4 form with a total of 2 equiv of NADH/FAD; 2 equiv of Fe(CN)6-3 quantitatively

R303M Mutant of Enterococcal NADH Peroxidase respective E-FADH2,NAD+ complexes; in part this reflects the increase in FAD/FADH2 redox potential in each case, ranging from -261 mV for the EH2 form of R303M to -197 mV for the oxidized form of C42A Npx. These dramatic shifts have previously been attributed (11) to the absence of the charge-transfer interaction with the electron-rich Cys42thiolate in each case, and the finding in the present study that the Cys42-SH pKa ) 8.2 for the R303M EH2 form (Figure 3) fully supports and extends that conclusion. In view of the documented participation of an E-FADH2,NAD+ intermediate in the catalytic cycle of R303M Npx, it is important to point out that similar intermediates were identified in enzyme-monitored turnover analyses of both C42S and L40C mutant enzymes, although the kcat values in these cases are both e0.1 s-1. It was also shown (11) that the C42S mutant was reduced by NADH under pseudo-firstorder conditions at an observed rate constant of 280-305 s-1, comparable to the kobs values of 240-280 s-1 measured for flavin reduction with oxidized and EH2 forms of R303M Npx. The Kd(NAD+) for C42S E-FADH2 binding, however, is higher than for R303M, allowing the determination of koff ) 134 s-1 for NAD+ release in the former case. We have similarly estimated the rate constant for NAD+ release from the wild-type Npx EH2 form at g250 s-1; both values are much greater than the rate-limiting reduction of Cys42-SOH within the R303M EH2,NAD+ intermediate. Further evidence that NAD+ release follows the redox step comes from the fact that the bound pyridine nucleotide has a considerable effect on the rate of EH2 formation. In a carefully monitored dithionite titration we measured a t1/2 of 12.3 min for the conversion of EH2 f EH2 at 25 °C; at 5 °C, however, the conversion of EH2,NAD+ f EH2 is at least 3 orders of magnitude faster. Intramolecular electron transfer within the EH2,AcPyAD+ complex is 10-20-fold slower than with bound NAD+, again reflecting the effect of the pyridine nucleotide. Mechanistic Considerations for FADH2 f Cys42-SOH Electron Transfer in Npx. In several respects, our results with the R303M peroxidase resemble those reported by Rietveld et al. (28) for the E. coli GR H439A mutant. As with R303M Npx, a discrete GR E-FADH2,NADP+ intermediate was only observed in the reductive half-reaction of the H439A mutant, not with the wild-type enzyme. This was attributed to a 16fold decrease in the rate constant for electron transfer from FADH2 to the redox-active disulfide in the GR mutant; stabilization of the nascent Cys47-thiolate (equivalent to Npx Cys42) by the protonated His439 was proposed to facilitate the process of disulfide reduction in wild-type GR. These observations are generally consistent with the fact that H439A GR exhibits kcat <1% that of wild-type enzyme, where the limiting rate of EH2 oxidation by GSSG appears to be 4-5 times faster than the rate of enzyme reduction by NADPH (490 and 110 s-1, respectively, at 4 °C). Further support for this catalytically important interaction between His439 and the Cys47 charge-transfer thiol was provided by Deonarain et al. (32), who demonstrated that the Cys47-SH pKa in a C42A, H439A double mutant was increased to 7.7 from a value of 5.7 in the C42A single mutant. This 2-unit shift in pKa, which is reflected in a significantly diminished EH2 charge-transfer band at pH 7.0, is qualitatively similar to that seen in the R303M Npx EH2

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 34, 2000 10363 form, where the magnitude of the pKa increase is g3.7 units (Figure 3). As to the chemical mechanism of Npx Cys42-SOH reduction, we have previously considered the possibility of direct hydride transfer from FADH2 N5 to the sulfur (18). Karplus and Schulz (33) suggested that a transient FADH C4a-S Cys63 covalent adduct could be involved in the comparable process of GR disulfide reduction. Cys63 S is 3.5 Å from FAD C4a, and the Cys58-Cys63 disulfide bond is in line with the proposed nucleophilic center, optimizing the geometric considerations for an SN2 displacement. The fate of the FADH N5 hydrogen was not clear, however. Vanoni et al. (34) reported a primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 4.0 for the reduction of spinach GR E f EH2 with (4S)-[4-2H]NADH, but this was attributed to hydride transfer within the E,NADH complex; no discrete E-FADH2 species was observed. The present study with R303M Npx clearly demonstrates the absence of an isotope effect on the FADH2 reoxidation rate constant, as E f EH2 with (4S)-[4-2H]NADH. The FAD N5 and -O4R positions in Npx are not accessible to solvent (35), suggesting that solvent exchange with the FADH2 N5 hydrogen (or deuterium) is likely to be very slow. These results are suggestive of a mechanistic alternative to direct hydride transfer from FADH2 f Cys42-SOH, possibly involving a C4a-adduct such as that proposed by Karplus and Schulz (33). There are two other factors that must be considered along with these proposals; first, unlike the situation with wild-type Npx, Cys42-SOH is likely to be protonated in the resting, oxidized R303M enzyme. In addition, the crystal structure of the mutant shows that the orientation of the Cyo42 S-O bond, relative to the plane of the flavin, is changed rather dramatically (Figure 9). Both factors are likely to contribute significantly to the efficiency of electron transfer from FADH2 to the Cys42-SOH redox center. At a minimum, the presence of Arg303 in Npx certainly stabilizes the nascent Cys42-thiolate formed on reduction of E f EH2, and this effect may be taken to account for a component of the thermodynamic stabilization of EH2. Regardless of the specific mechanism involved, the transfer of electrons from FADH2 f Cys42-SOH must involve a transition state with partial negative charge on Cys42 S (18); stabilization of this charged transition state by Arg303 would also account for the much more rapid FADH2 reoxidation rate with wild-type Npx (k .25 s-1) compared to the R303M mutant (k ) 2.4-3 s-1). Analysis of the recent 2.1 Å structure of the native wild-type enzyme,3 however, demonstrates clearly that the closest approach between Cyo42 S and the charged guanidinium moiety of Arg303 is 7.9 Å. In the absence of an unusual long-range electrostatic effect, it is tempting to suggest that this effect is mediated by the intervening His10; we have already shown, however, that His10 mutants of Npx retain strong EH2 charge-transfer properties at pH 5.4 (8). It should also be pointed out that the 2.0 Å structure of the EH2,NADH complex of human erythrocyte GR (33) shows that His467 N 2 (equivalent to His439 in the E. coli enzyme), although it is directly implicated in stabilization of the charge-transfer thiolate by the results of Deonarain et al. (32), is 4.7 Å from the chargetransfer Cys63 S in the human enzyme. The effects of both the active-site His in GR and Arg303 in Npx on the respective Cys-SH pKa values may be enhanced by the apolar

10364 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 34, 2000 active-site microenvironments that apply in both cases. The structures of the wild-type Npx EH2,NADH complex and oxidized His10 mutants have recently been solved3 and should offer additional information on this apparent paradox.
