A data set from the serine protease porcine pancreatic elastase was Ê collected at atomic resolution (1.1 A) with synchrotron radiation. The improved resolution allows the determination of atom positions with high accuracy, as well as the localization of H atoms. Three residues could be modelled in alternative positions. The catalytic triad of elastase consists of His57, Asp102 and Ser195. The His57 N1 H atom Ê was located at a distance of 0.82 A from the N1 atom. The distance 1 Ê between His57 N and Asp102 O2 is 2.70 Æ 0.04 A, thus indicating normal hydrogen-bonding geometry. Additional H atoms at His57 N42 and Ser195 O could not be identi®ed in the Fo À Fc density maps.

1. Introduction
The availability of high-intensity X-ray beam sources such as synchrotrons and of ef®cient X-ray imaging detectors, as well as the introduction of macromolecular cryocrystallography, has led in recent years to the solution and re®nement of a series of proteins at atomic resolution (for a review, see Dauter et al., 1997). According to Sheldrick (1990), a protein structure can be solved at atomic resolution when its diffraction data extend to at least Ê 1.2 A. In such structures, the relatively large data-to-parameter ratio allows anisotropic temperature-factor re®nement. This leads to a signi®cant improvement of the calculated phases and to a strong regression of the crystallographic R factor, thus allowing a very accurate calculation of the coordinates as well as the coordinate error of the structure. Here, we report the re®nement of native porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) at a resoluÊ tion of 1.1 A. The digestive enzyme PPE (E.C. 3.4.21.36) is a multi-speci®c serine protease composed of 240 amino acids in its active state (for a review, see Bode et al., 1989). Since its tertiary structure was elucidated for the ®rst time (Watson et al., 1970), a number of structures of native and complexed PPE have been published, making PPE one of the best strucÊ turally studied enzymes so far (1.65 A, Meyer Ê et al., 1988; 1.6 A, Wilmouth et al., 1998). Besides extending the accuracy of the PPE structure to the thus far highest resolution, the PPE structure reported here provides insight into the protonation of the catalytic triad of this enzyme in the native state.

Porcine pancreatic elastase was purchased from Serva (Heidelberg). Crystals were grown at 291 K using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method from a solution containing 0.25 M Na2SO4. Protein (40 mg mlÀ1) and precipitant were mixed in a 1:1 ratio. The ®nal pH was determined to be between 7.0 and 8.0. Crystals grew overnight to dimensions of 0.2 Â 0.2 Â 0.4 mm. Crystals were soaked in 20% glycerol for cryo-cooling prior to X-ray exposure. A Ê high-resolution (20.7±1.1 A) and a low-resoluÊ ) data set were collected at tion (45.6±1.5 A 100 K from a single crystal with 0.5 oscillations at the X11 synchrotron beamline, DESY, Hamburg using a MAR345 imaging plate (X-ray Research, Hamburg) and a wavelength Ê of 0.9116 A. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and have unit-cell dimensions Ê a = 49.91, b = 57.82, c = 74.27 A. They contain one elastase molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystal mosaicity was re®ned to 0.66 . A total of 1 071 726 observations in the resolution Ê range 45.6±1.1 A were reduced to 81 820 unique re¯ections. The merged data set contained 92.7% of the re¯ections expected in this resolution range. The overall Rmerge was 4.5% (35% in the highest resolution shell; for details see Table 1).

A ®rst model was calculated after molecular replacement (AMoRe; Navaza, 1994) using Ê the 1.6 A resolution structure of PPE (Wilmouth et al., 1998; PDB entry code 1btu). No signi®cant non-isomorphism was detected compared with the published structure. It was re®ned in a ®rst step with isotropic B factors using the maximum-likelihood method with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). R and Rfree converged at 25.8 and 27.4%, respectively. In a second step, ARPP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993) was used together with REFMAC to localize a total of 347 solvent molecules. Water peaks were inserted by ARPP according to their distances to hydrogen-bonding partners and omitted from the structure if the peak height in the 2Fo À Fc electron-density maps was less than 0.5' r.m.s.. All water molecules were carefully inspected (and corrected) manually using O (Jones et al., 1991) and XFIT (McRee, 1993). An isotropic BÊ factor cutoff of 60 A2 for solvent molecules was introduced to avoid over®tting. Re®nement in this step converged at R = 19.5% and Rfree = 21.5%. In the next step, anisotropic B factors were introduced and the structure was re®ned using conjugate-gradient least-squares minimization with SHELXL97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). Anisotropic B factors of protein atoms were restrained in the atom bond direction (DELU command) and, according to their distances (SIMU command), the anisotropic B factors of water molecules were restrained to isotropy with the ISOR command. The respective restraints in the ®nal re®nement cycles were set to 0.1, 0.025 and 0.1 as indicated by Merritt (1999). Some water molecules and three amino-acid residues showed split positions and were re®ned with the sum of their occupational factors constrained to unity; additionally, riding H atoms were introduced into the

model. In a ®nal re®nement step, a single full-matrix least-squares minimization cycle (LS command) was carried out. In this cycle, all restraints were turned off and B factors were not re®ned (BLOC 1 command). This ®nal model led to R = 12.67% and Rfree = 16.52%. Inclusion of the 5% test-set re¯ections did not improve the R factor. The model was evaluated using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), WHAT CHECK (Hooft et al., 1996) and PARVATI (Merritt, 1999).

3. Results and discussion
The decisive step in the re®nement of atomic resolution structures is the introduction of anisotropic temperature factors. In our case, besides lowering the crystallographic R factor, this led to a substantial improvement of the quality of calculated phases, as seen in the electron-density maps. As an example, Fig. 1 shows the 2Fo À Fc electron-density map and the Fo À Fc electron-density map of Glu153. Compared with the isotropic starting model (Fig. 1a) and an isotropic model with riding H atoms (Fig. 1b), the reduction of the 2.5' contoured Fo À Fc electron density is apparent in the anisotropic B-factor model (Fig. 1c). This effect is observable throughout the whole protein molecule. In the ®nal model, electron difference peaks at the 2.5' level are almost restricted to the solvent region. The resulting model shows excellent agreement between the localization of the polypeptide chain and the 2Fo À Fc electrondensity maps. Fig. 2(a) shows the 3.5' contoured 2Fo À Fc map of the catalytic site. The atomic resolution of most atoms is clearly visible at this contour level. Electron density does smear between some atoms, but only in the case of some conjugated electron systems (e.g. peptide bonds). From this map, the expected conformation of the His57 imidazole ring is con®rmed by the localization of the larger N atoms. The equal electron distribution of the carboxyl group of Asp102 is also clearly observable. The high resolution of the elastase was employed to improve several features of the model, such as the correct conformation of most asparagine and glutamine residues according to the expected electron distribution in the amide group. Also, a sodium ion from the precipitant is found in the known calcium-binding site. However, a few residues could not be localized completely. These residues (notably Arg36, Ser36C, Arg125) are generally part of surface loops and have large B factors.

Phase improvement led to the localization of at least three residues with alternative positions (Val83, Ser217, Arg223). In general, our resulting model superposes very Ê well with the 1.6 A PPE model of an enzyme±inhibitor complex soaked with 20% glycerol (Wilmouth et al., 1998) and the Ê 1.65 A model of native PPE in 70% methanol (Meyer et al., 1988). Compared with the starting model of Wilmouth et al. (1998), our structure has an r.m.s. deviation Ê Ê of 0.43 A for all protein atoms and 0.14 A for the C atoms. The corresponding values for the PPE structure reported by Meyer et Ê al. (1988) are 0.82 and 0.29 A, respectively. The higher values in the latter case might be caused by the different cryo-buffers used. In both cases, the highest deviations correspond to atoms of the side chains of surface amino acids that have a different conformation in our structure (e.g. for Ê Arg61 NH2, 5.7 A deviation from the model Ê of Wilmouth et al., 1998 and 8.2 A deviation from the structure of Meyer et al., 1988). The highest deviation of a C atom corresponds to a slightly shifted surface loop Ê (Gly36B C, 0.7 A deviation from the model Ê of Wilmouth et al., 1998; Ser36C C, 1.0 A deviation from the model of Meyer et al., 1988). Ê Based on a cutoff radius of 1 A, 85% of all water molecules in the model of Wilmouth et al. (1998) and 78% of all water molecules in the model of Meyer et al. (1988) can be considered as conserved in our model. This is especially valid for the internal water clusters of PPE as described by Meyer et al. (1988). Moreover, the higher resolution of our data allowed the localization of more water molecules than in these previous structures. The coordinate error of the ®nal model was calculated as the estimated standard deviation (e.s.d.) of the coordinates by a ®nal full-matrix least-squares minimization. This procedure yields e.s.d.s between Ê 0.01 and 0.05 A for about 80% of all protein atoms. E.s.d. values are highly correlated with the temperature factor. The e.s.d.s of His57 N1 and N42, Asp102 O1 and O2 as well as of Ser195 O are of the magnitude of Ê 0.02 A. The calculated distances between some of these atoms together with their error margins are shown in Table 2. The anisotropy (A = Emin/Emax, the quotient of the minimum and maximum eigenvectors of the anisotropic displacement parameter matrix as de®ned by Trueblood et al., 1996) of all protein atoms has a mean value of 0.527 (' = 0.148) and is, as expected, strongly correlated with the corresponding distance

of the atoms from the centre of mass of the molecule. In the ®nal model, the r.m.s. deviation of Ê all atom distances from ideality is 0.016 A  and the r.m.s. of all binding angles is 2.291 . No residues have forbidden conformations in the Ramachandran plot, 87.4% of all nonglycine and non-proline residues being in the most favoured conformation and 12.6% in the additionally allowed region. These are roughly the same values as in the previous Ê 1.6 A structure of Meyer et al. (1988). Like in other atomic resolution structures (Dauter et al., 1997; Longhi et al., 1997), we see a signi®cant deviation of the peptide torsion angle 3 from planarity. This value ranges from 156.4 (Pro198) to 191.9 (Ser170). The mean value of this angle is 178.6 , with a standard deviation of 6.0 . An interesting feature of atomic resolution structures is the ability to deduce the position of H atoms from Fo À Fc maps. In the case of PPE, we were able to localize the position of the HN1 atom of the catalytic His57 (Fig. 2b). It has been hypothesized that this atom forms a so-called LBHB (lowbarrier hydrogen bond) near the transition state of the peptide-cleavage reaction, thus strengthening the basicity of the His57 N42

atom so that it can more easily accept a proton from Ser195. Although this would explain the observed enhanced nucleophilicity of Ser195, experimental veri®cation of this hypothesis has led to controversial results in recent years (Frey et al., 1994; Ash et al., 1997). To observe the position of the HN1 atom in native elastase, an OMIT map was calculated after removing this atom from the model. To avoid covering the difference electron density by anisotropic re®nement of the N1 atom, the B factors of this atom were re®ned isotropically. After 20 CGLS cycles, the maps shown in Fig. 2(b) were calculated. An Fo À Fc peak at the 2.5' level which would correspond to a histidine H atom can be observed. The distance of the maximum of this peak to the N1 atom is Ê 0.82 A, whereas the distance between the His57 N1 and the Asp102 O2 atom is Ê 2.70 Æ 0.04 A. In an LBHB, the distance between the donor and the acceptor atom is shorter and the H atom is further away from the donor (Frey et al., 1994). The HN1 atom therefore shows conventional hydrogenbonding geometry in our structure, as expected for native PPE. Calculation of an OMIT map with anisotropic B factors for N1 and only ®ve CGLS cycles led to the same result (not shown). To validate both methods we calculated OMIT maps of the H atoms of 36 main-chain N atoms. In about 40% of all cases, we were able to ®nd Fo À Fc peaks that corresponded to the expected H atoms. The results obtained by re®ning the N atoms isotropically or anisotropically (only ®ve CGLS cycles) were roughly the same. This indicates that the Fo À Fc electron-density peak related to the HN1 atom in our OMIT calculations is signi®cant. We were not able to calculate OMIT maps that led either to the unequivocal identi®cation of a signi®cant Fo À Fc electrondensity peak that could be related to His57 HN42 or Ser195 HO. This observation was also made in other atomic resolution structures of lytic enzymes [cutinase at pH 7 (Longhi et al., 1997) and subtilisin at pH 5.9 (Kuhn et al., 1998)]. Fig. 2(c) shows the thermal ellipsoid representation of the atoms near the catalytic triad of PPE. Probable hydrogen bonds are shown as dotted lines. A sulfate ion is localized in the `oxyanion hole'. This structure represents PPE in its relaxed native state at atomic resolution and is thus a starting point for further atomic resolution

studies concerning the enzymatic mechanism of this and other serine proteases.
