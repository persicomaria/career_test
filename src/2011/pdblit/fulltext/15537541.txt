Abstract Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) regulate diverse cellular functions such as cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling by ubiquitinating key regulatory proteins. The activity of CRLs is controlled by Nedd8 modification of the cullin subunits. Recent reports have suggested that CAND1, which specifically binds to unmodified CUL1 but not to neddylated one, is required for the in vivo function of SCFs, the CUL1-containing CRLs. We show here that CAND1 and COP9 signalosome (CSN), the major deneddylase of cullins, bind to unneddylated CUL1 in a mutually exclusive way. The suppression of CAND1 expression by small inhibitory RNA enhanced the interaction between CUL1 and CSN, suggesting that CAND1 inhibited the binding of CSN to CUL1. We found that the binding of CSN to CUL1 required the four helix bundle in CUL1 C-terminal domain, which was wrapped around by CAND1 in the CAND1-CUL1-Rbx1 complex. CAND1 greatly facilitated CSN-mediated deneddylation of CUL1 in vitro, which was dependent on its binding to CUL1. Our data suggest that enhancement of CSN-mediated deneddylation by CAND1 may contribute to its function as a positive regulator of SCFs in vivo. ” 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) are a family of ubiquitin ligases that contain a member of cullin family proteins and the RING finger protein Rbx1 (also known as ROC1 and Hrt1) or Rbx2, which together form the integral core of the enzymes [1≠4]. Cullins are linked to targeted substrates by specific adaptor proteins and an array of substrate-recognizing subunits, while Rbx1 or Rbx2 interacts with the cognate ubiquitin conjugating enzyme [5]. In SCF complexes, the prototype of CRLs, the N-terminus of CUL1 interacts with the adaptor Skp1, which, in turn, recruits F-box proteins containing a variable protein≠protein interaction domain that directly binds substrates [6≠8]. CRLs with other cullin

proteins appear to share an analogous modular architecture. There exist a large number of F-box, SOCS-box, VHL-box, and BTB domain proteins presumed to form complexes with distinct cullins, which makes CRLs the largest class of E3 ubiquitin ligases [9≠13]. Activities of CRLs are regulated by modification of cullin subunits with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 [14]. The Nedd8 conjugation pathway has been reported to be essential for cell viability in fission yeast [15] and for the early development in Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, and mice [16≠18]. Conjugation of Nedd8 to CUL1 increases the activity of SCF complexes and enhances E2-ubiquitin recruitment to SCF ubiquitin ligases in vitro [19≠22]. Defects in the neddylation pathway lead to substrate accumulation, consistent with the notion that neddylation of cullins positively regulates CRLs [23]. Deconjugation of Nedd8 is mediated

After gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue G-250, protein bands were excised and digested with trypsin as previously described [35]. In-gel tryptic digests of proteins were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) using Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems) and by nanoelectrospray liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC≠MS≠MS) on API QSTAR Pulsar Q-TOF (Applied Biosystems) in the informationdependent acquisition mode. The MS≠MS spectra were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant and expressed sequence tag databases using the computer algorithm proID (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting. Transfection was carried out using the polyethylenenamine methodology [36]. After 36 h, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0% NP-40. Cell lysates were adjusted to 0.1% NP-40 and incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody resin (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 ∞C. The immune complexes were recovered by low speed centrifugation, and the resin was washed extensively with the binding buffer with 0.1% NP-40 and then eluted with buffer containing 20 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 8.0) and 2% SDS or with buffer with 0.3 mg FLAG peptide per ml. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS≠PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and visualized by Western blotting with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham-Pharmacia). For Western blotting, we purchased commercial antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), HA (Abcam), CAND1, CSN2, CSN5 (BD Biosciences), and CUL1 (Lab Vision). RNA interference. Specific siRNAs for CAND1 was generated using the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Specific siRNAs for GAPDH were provided in the kit. Two 29-mer DNA oligonucleotides for CAND1 (sense, 5 0 TGT CTT GGT CCT TTA GTG AGT CCT GTC TC-3 0 ; antisense, 5 0 -TCA CTA AAG GAC CAA GAC ATT CCT GTC TC-3 0 ) with 21 nucleotides encoding the siRNA for CAND1 and eight nucleotides complementary to the T7 promoter primer were synthesized. The two siRNA templates were hybridized to a T7 promoter primer and were extended by the Klenow DNA polymerase. The extended sense and antisense siRNA templates were then transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase and hybridized to create double-stranded siRNA following the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty picomoles of siRNA were transfected to HeLa cells grown on six-well plates with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies). Twelve hours later, the expression constructs for FLAG-CUL1 and HA-Rbx1 were transfected into HeLa cells. Deneddylation assays. Recombinant six-histidine-tagged Nedd8 and Ubc12 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified using Co2+≠agarose beads (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The FLAG-Uba3/APP-BP complex was purified from HeLa derived cells stably transfected with an expression vector pYR-FLAG-hUba3 as previously described [29]. Generation of recombinant baculoviruses encoding human CUL1 with a six-His tag and human Rbx1 were previously described [31]. Sf21 cells were coinfected with the recombinant baculoviruses encoding His-CUL1 and Rbx1, and cell lysates were prepared as described [37]. The His-CUL1/ Rbx1 complex was purified using Co2+≠agarose beads (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Recombinant FLAGHis-tagged CAND1 and its deletion mutant were expressed in Sf21 cells [38]. His-CUL1/Rbx1 (1.0 lg) bound to Co2+≠agarose beads was neddylated in the reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM NaF, 100 nM okadaic acid, 2 mM ATP, 0.6 mM DTT, 5.0 lg His-Nedd8 , 250 ng FLAG-Uba3/APP-BP, and 1.0 lg Ubc12. Reactions were incubated at 37 ∞C for 30 min, and after washing the beads, neddylated CUL1 was eluted from the beads as recommended by the manufacturer. Deneddylation reactions were performed in a 30 ll reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris≠HCl (pH

by the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a conserved multiprotein complex composed of eight subunits [24,25]. Genetic studies show that mutations in CSN subunits which lead to constitutive neddylation of cullins cause substrates to accumulate, indicating that deneddylation by CSN also positively regulates the function of CRLs [24,26]. These studies have suggested that the cycles of neddylation and deneddylation may be needed to sustain optimal CRL activities. In searching for proteins regulating CRLs, we and others have identified CAND1/TIP120A as a cullin-interacting protein [27≠30]. CAND1 forms a complex with the CUL1-Rbx1 core and inhibits the activity of SCFs in vitro by competing with Skp1 and F-box proteins for CUL1 binding. CAND1 binding to the unmodified CUL1 blocks Rbx1-mediated neddylation of CUL1 [31,32]. Once neddylated, CUL1 can no longer bind to CAND1. The crystal structure of the CAND1-Cul1Rbx1 complex reveals that CAND1 occupies the Skp1 binding site of CUL1 and the CUL1 neddylation site is buried by CAND1. Genetic studies with Arabidopsis thaliana further show that plant CAND1 is required for normal function of SCFs, suggesting that CAND1 is a positive regulator of SCF function [33,34]. Collectively, these studies support the idea that association/ dissociation of CAND1 coupled to neddylation/deneddylation of cullins plays an important role in assembly and disassembly of functional SCFs and other CRLs. It remains to be determined, however, how cycles of assembly and disassembly of functional CRLs operate. In this report, we show that the binding of CAND1 and CSN to CUL1 is mutually exclusive and present evidence that CAND1 facilitates CSN-mediated CUL1 deneddylation. Materials and methods
Plasmids. The cDNAs encoding human CSN1 (Accession No. U20285), CSN2 (BC012629), CSN3 (BC001891), CSN4 (BC004302), CSN5 (BC001187), CSN6 (BC002520), CSN7A (BC011789), and CSN8 (BC003095) were obtained from the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) gene service. To construct plasmids for the expression of N-terminally FLAG- or HA-tagged proteins, cDNAs were amplified by PCR with appropriate primers and ligated into pYR vectors [29] or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Expression constructs of human FLAGCUL1 and its deletion mutants were previously described [31]. Stable cell lines, protein complex purification, and protein identification by mass spectrometry. HeLa Tet-Off (Clontech) derived cell lines conditionally expressing FLAG-CSN3, FLAG-CUL1 and FLAGCUL1CD31 were established as described previously [29]. To induce the expression of FLAG-tagged proteins, cells were grown without tetracycline for 2 days. Nuclear extracts and cytosolic S100 extracts were prepared as described previously [29]. Extracts were dialyzed against buffer BC (20 mM Tris≠HCl [pH 7.9], 15% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% NP-40] containing 150 mM KCl (BC150) and rotated with antiFLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) at 4 ∞C for 3≠6 h. After extensive washes with BC150, proteins were eluted with 0.3 mg FLAG peptide per ml in BC150. Immunopurified protein complexes were resolved on a 4≠20%

Results and discussion Enhanced interaction with CSN of the CUL1 derivative defective of CAND1 binding From the previous study on purification of CAND1 from HeLa cells we found that CAND1 was stably associated with cullin family members, but not with the CSN complex [29]. Since CSN was known to interact with cullins, this study raised the possibility that CAND1 might affect the interaction between cullins and CSN. To address this possibility, we established HeLa-derived cell lines that conditionally expressed FLAG-CSN3, FLAG-CUL1, and FLAG-CUL1CD31, a CUL1 mutant with the deletion of the C-terminal 31 amino acids which impaired its binding to CAND1. FLAG-tagged proteins and their associated proteins were then purified from extracts of induced cells by an immunoaffinity purification procedure using beads immobilized by anti-FLAG antibody. Purified proteins were subjected to SDS≠poly-

acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein bands were excised and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 1A, data not shown). FLAG-CSN3 preparation contained all subunits of CSN, cullin family members, and DDB1 (Fig. 1A, left panel). CAND1, however, was not detected in the same preparation, suggesting that the interaction of CSN with cullins might inhibit that of CAND1 with cullins. Immunoaffinity purification of FLAG-CUL1 showed that most FLAG-CUL1 was associated with CAND1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A, middle panel). CSN was hardly detectable in the FLAG-CUL1 preparation, as confirmed by Western blotting analysis with antibodies against CSN subunits (Fig. 1B). In contrast, CSN subunits were efficiently co-purified with the FLAGCUL1CD31 mutant incapable of binding to CAND1 (Figs. 1A, right panel and B). Together, these data strongly suggested that the binding of CAND1 and CSN to CUL1 was mutually exclusive. CAND1 inhibits the binding of CSN to CUL1 CUL1 was reported to interact strongly with CSN2 in yeast two-hybrid assays [24,25]. However, CUL1 did not efficiently pull-down CSN2 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments following their over-expression in HeLa

cells, indicating that other CSN subunits were required for the interaction between CUL1 and the CSN complex (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that partial CSN complexes with less than whole subunits could support an efficient interaction with CUL1, combinations of HA-tagged CSN subunits were co-expressed with FLAG-CUL1 in HeLa cells. HA-CSN subunits were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and co-purified FLAG-CUL1 was probed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 2). Co-expression of CSN1, CSN2, CSN4, and CSN5 lead to efficient co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-CUL1, the level of which corresponded to approximately 60% of that obtained following co-expression of entire CSN subunits (lanes 1 and 2). Removal of either one of the four CSN subunits in transfection experiments greatly reduced co-precipitation of FLAG-CUL1 (lanes 3≠6), suggesting that CSN1, CSN2, CSN4, and CSN5 could form a minimal complex capable of robust interaction with CUL1 in HeLa cells. To confirm that CAND1 and CSN bound in a mutually exclusive way to CUL1, HeLa cells were transfected with expression constructs of epitope-tagged CAND1, CUL1, and CSN subunits minimally required for efficient binding to CUL1. Epitope-tagged CAND1, CUL1, or CSN subunits were then immunoprecipitated with suitable antibodies, and co-purified proteins were probed by immunoblotting as shown in Fig. 3A. Whereas FLAG-CUL1 was immunoprecipitated with HA-CAND1 and HA-CSN subunits (lane 6), the immunoprecipitates of FLAG-CAND1 contained only HACUL1, but not HA-CSN subunits (lane 4), and those

of HA-CSN subunits contained only FLAG-CUL1, but not FLAG-CAND1 (lane 5). These data demonstrated mutually exclusive binding of CAND1 and CSN to CUL1. To further investigate the competition between CAND1 and CSN for the binding to CUL1, we used siRNA to suppress expression of endogenous CAND1 in HeLa cells that stably express FLAG-CUL1. CAND1 expression was greatly diminished only in cells transfected with CAND1 siRNA, but not in cells transfected with GAPDH siRNA (Fig. 3B). CSN2 and FLAGCUL1 expression was not affected by the siRNA treatments, indicating the specificity of these siRNAs. FLAG-CUL1 was immunoprecipitated from siRNAtreated cells with anti-FLAG antibodies, and co-purified CAND1 and CSN2 were probed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies (Fig. 3B). Without any siRNA treatment, FLAG-CUL1 immunoprecipitates contained

CAND1, but an undetectable level of CSN2 (lane 5). Treatment of GAPDH-specific siRNA did not affect the interaction pattern of FLAG-CUL1 with CSN2 and CAND1 (lane 6). In contrast, siRNA-mediated suppression of CAND1 resulted in a marked increase in binding of CSN2 to CUL1 (lanes 7 and 8). These data demonstrated that CAND1 interfered with binding of CSN to CUL1. Mapping of the domains of CUL1 required for its interaction with CSN Recently reported crystal structure of the CAND1CUL1-Rbx1 complex showed that CAND1, consisting of 27 tandem HEAT repeats, made multiple and extensive intermolecular contacts with CUL1 [32]. The C-terminal two-thirds of CAND1 wrapped around N-terminal stalk of CUL1, interacting with all three cullin repeats. The N-terminal one-third of CAND1 curled around globular C-terminal domain (CTD) of CUL1, making contacts with the four-helix bundle (4HB) and the winged helix B (WH-B) domain of CTD. To understand the nature of mutually exclusive binding of CAND1 and CSN to CUL1, we

mapped the structural features of CUL1 required for the interaction with CSN. A series of expression vectors for FLAG-tagged CUL1 deletion mutants together with vectors for HA-CSN subunits were transiently transfected into HeLa cells and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was carried out on the cell lysates. The binding of CSN subunits to CUL1 was monitored by Western blotting of immunoprecipitates with antiHA antibodies (Fig. 4). Deletion of the N-terminal 414 amino acids (CUL1ND414), which includes entire cullin repeats, did not affect CSN binding, indicating that CUL1 CTD was sufficient for CSN binding. However, further deletion of the 4HB and the a/b domain in CUL1 CTD (CUL1ND600) rendered the mutant incapable of binding to CSN subunits. Deletion of the C-terminal 172 amino acids of CUL1 (CUL1CD172), which impaired CUL1 binding to CAND1 and to Rbx1, did not reduce appreciably its interaction with CSN. These results suggested that the binding of CSN to CUL1 required the 4HB and the a/b domain in CUL1 CTD. Since CSN deneddylates all members of cullin family, the part of cullins responsible for CSN binding should be conserved. In this regard, it is noted that the 4HB is in high conser-

vation among cullin family members from various species. Structural studies showed that the 4HB, which is next to the WH-B domain containing the neddylation site, is covered by CAND1 in the CAND1-CUL1Rbx1 complex. Based on these data, it appears likely that CSN makes contacts mainly with the 4HB of CUL1 and that CAND1 binding to CUL1 blocks the access of CSN to the 4HB of CUL1. CAND1 enhances deneddylation of CUL1 by CSN CSN interacts with CUL1, irrespective of its neddylation state, while CAND1 associates only with unneddylated CUL1 but not with neddylated one [27,28,31]. Our data showed that CAND1 inhibited CSN binding to unneddylated CUL1. This result raised the possibility that CAND1 might enhance CSN-mediated deneddylation of CUL1 by facilitating the dissociation of CSN from unneddylated CUL1 and by sequestering from the deneddylation reaction unneddylated CUL, the reaction product. To test this possibility, we devised an in vitro deneddylation assay, in which recombinant HisCUL1/Rbx1 complex purified from insect cells was first neddylated in vitro as previously described [31] and used as the substrate for the assay. Deneddylation reactions were carried out by incubating the substrate with FLAG-CSN3 complex purified from HeLa cells shown in Fig. 1A in the presence or absence of recombinant CAND1. As shown in Fig. 5, the CSN preparation by itself showed low deneddylase activity on neddylated

Fig. 5. CAND1 enhances deneddylation of CUL1 by CSN. Recombinant His-CUL1/Rbx1 complex was neddylated in vitro as described in Materials and methods. Neddylated CUL1 was incubated with CSN complex purified from HeLa cells shown in Fig. 1 in the presence of 1 lg bovine serum albumin (lanes 3≠5), recombinant FLAG-HisCAND1 (lanes 6≠8), or FLAG-His-CAND1CD304 (lane 9) as indicated. Reactions were performed at 25 ∞C and terminated by adding Laemmli loading buffer at specified times. Reactions were resolved by SDS≠PAGE followed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies to visualize CUL1 and CAND1.

CUL1 (lanes 3≠5). Addition of CAND1 to the reaction, however, greatly enhanced the deneddylase activity of CSN (lanes 6≠8). CAND1 alone did not show any deneddylase activity (lane 10). In addition, CAND1CD304, a CAND1 deletion mutant that cannot bind to CUL1, did not increase deneddylase activity (lane 9), suggesting that the effect of CAND1 on deneddylase activity was dependent on its binding to CUL1. Since CAND1 does not interact with CSN, these data suggested that CAND1 facilitated CSN-mediated deneddylation indirectly by selectively binding to unneddylated cullins with high affinity, which would release CSN bound to unneddylated cullins and restrict CSN to the interaction only with neddylated cullins. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that CAND1 tightly binds to CUL1 with multiple and extensive contacts, which would lead to sequestration of CUL1 in an inactive form by interfering with its binding to Skp1 and F-box proteins [27≠29,32]. Here, we have extended our understanding of CAND1 function by examining the effect of CAND1 on CSN binding to CUL1 and on CSN-mediated CUL1 deneddylation. Several lines of evidence indicate that CAND1 competes with CSN for binding to unneddylated CUL1. While CUL1 associates with CAND1 and CSN in both stable and transient transfection experiments, CAND1 interacts with CUL1 but not with CSN, and CSN interacts with CUL1 but not with CAND1. A CUL1 mutant incapable of binding CAND1 interacts more efficiently with CSN than the wild-type CUL1. In addition, siRNA-mediated suppression of CAND1 expression increases the interaction between CUL1 and CSN. Our analysis of CUL1 mutants further indicates that CSN binding requires the 4HB and the a/b domain in CUL1 CTD, which is wrapped around by CAND1 in the CAND1-CUL1-Rbx1 complex, providing an explanation on mutually exclusive binding of CAND1 and CSN to CUL1. The functional consequence of inhibition of CSN binding to unneddylated CUL1 appears the enhancement of CSN-mediated CUL1 deneddylation by CAND1. Genetic data indicate that CAND1 is required for proper function of SCF in vivo despite biochemical data showing negative regulation of SCF by CAND1 [25,39,40]. Likewise, genetic studies show that CSN is a positive regulator of SCF function although biochemical data demonstrate that CSN negatively regulates SCF activity in vitro [34,41]. Recent studies provide a plausible explanation for the seemingly contradictory data by showing that CSN protects substrate-binding subunits from autocatalytic destruction and may function in SCF assembly [42,43]. By facilitating CSN-mediated deneddylation as well as by keeping CAND1-bound cullins in an inactive state, CAND1 may help stabilize substrate-binding subunits of CRLs and play an important role in promoting cycles of assembly and disassembly

of CRLs. Currently, the process of CRL assembly is not well characterized. Further studies are needed to understand CAND1 function in assembly and disassembly of functional SCFs and other CRLs.
