Introduction. The 128-residue Xcc05161 (SwissProt accession number: Q8PD29) of phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris was annotated as a conserved hypothetical cytosolic protein with a molecular weight of 14.6 kDa and a calculated isoelectric point of 9.7. A BLAST2 database search clearly showed that Xcc0516 belongs to the structurally and functionally uncharacterized Ribosomal_S23p protein family (Pfam3 domain PF05635). To obtain functional insights from the structural viewpoint as well as to provide structural coverage for this protein family, Xcc0516 was selected as a target for structural determination. And the crystal structure of Xcc0516 has ° been determined at 2.5 A resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method. Although it turns out that the Xcc0516 monomer folds into an antiparallel four-helix bundle, interestingly, five protomers associate around a fivefold axis to form a pentameric toroid-shaped structure with a tapered central channel. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a pentameric toroid formed by nontransmembrane four-helix bundle domain. In addition, with the formation of a 10-helix inner ring that faces the central channel, the architecture of Xcc0516 homopentamer contrasts sharply with that of the pentameric membrane-spanning acetylcholine receptor.4 Therefore, the pentameric structure we report here represents a new quaternary assembly formed by four-helix bundles. Materials and Methods. Cloning, expression, and purification.. The ORF of Xcc0516 from X. campestris was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pMAL-c2x vector (New England Biolabs) to allow its expression as a fusion protein with a C-terminal 63 His-tag and a factor Xa-cleavable N-terminal MBP. Expression of selenomethionyl Xcc0516 was achieved at 208C after inducing for 16 h with 1 mM IPTG in E. coli strain B834(DE3) in M9 medium supplemented with 40 lg/mL seleno-L-methionine.5 Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellet was resuspended in the lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM diothreitol (DTT), 1 mM EDTA , 10% (v/v) glycerol).

(by French Press) and centrifugation, the clarified cell lysate was applied to an amylose column (New England Biolabs) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA). The column was first washed with buffer A plus 0.3 mM maltose, and the bound protein was then eluted with the same buffer plus 10 mM maltose. Fractions containing the fusion protein MBP-Xcc0516 were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/mL. The MBP moiety was removed by adding factor Xa (Novagen), and the cleavage reaction mixture was loaded onto an immobilized Ni2þ affinity column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM potassium phosphate pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM bME, 1 mM PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The resulting 63His-tagged Xcc0516 was eluted with buffer B plus 500 mM imidazole. The Ni2þ column eluate was further subjected to Superdex 200 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in buffer C (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA) to remove residual uncut MBP-Xcc0516. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 15 mg/mL for crystallization. Protein crystallization.. Xcc0516 was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method by mixing 2 lL of the protein and 2 lL of reservoir solution containing 200 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Na cacodylate pH 6.0, 16% (w/v) 1,6-hexanediol, 100 mM CsCl, and equilibrated at 48C against 450 lL of reservoir solution. Prior to X-ray data collection, crystals of Xcc0516 were trans-

of 28.3% with good stereochemistry (Table I). A total of 98.7% of nonglycine residues have main-chain torsion angles in the most favored regions of Ramachandran plot and none in the disallowed regions. Although a BLAST2 search revealed no significant sequence similarity to any proteins with known threedimensional structure, Xcc0516 folds into a four-helix bundle with a typical up-down-up-down arrangement of helices to enclose a compact hydrophobic core [Fig. 1(A)]. This observation was quite unexpected, given that many residues with lower helical propensity are present in both helices a2 (Val51, Ser52, Ile53, Pro54, Ser55, Asn56, and Ile57) and a3 (Ser74, Ile75, Gly78, Ser79, Ser81, Asp84, Thr85, Val87, and Ile89). As a result, these stretches were not correctly predicted to be helical according to all secondary structure prediction tools provided by the ExPASy Proteomics Server, which may also explain why comparative fold recognition and tertiary structure prediction methods failed to recognize Xcc0516 as a four-helix bundle. The Xcc0516 homopentamer.. A very interesting finding of this study is that five Xcc0516 monomers in the asymmetric unit associate around a noncrystallographic C5 axis to form a toroid-shaped pentamer with a central channel [Fig. 1(B)]. This structural indication for Xcc0516 being a pentamer in solution is consistent with results obtained by gel-filtration analysis (data not shown). The Xcc0516 pentamer is mainly stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions formed between helices a2 and a3. In addition, the C-terminal region of a1 also contacts a3 of the neighboring monomer. Together, $34% of the total ° solvent-accessible surface area ($2419 A2 as calculated 12 by the program AREAIMOL ) per monomer were buried. When viewed along the five-fold axis [Fig. 1(B)], it can be seen that helices a2 and a3 form a 10-helix inner ring to shape the channel lumen, and the remaining 10 helices (a1 and a4) form an outer ring. This overall architecture is similar to the pentameric membranespanning pore of acetylcholine receptor.4 Although the latter is also assembled from five four-helix bundles, each receptor subunit contributes only a single helix to the pore-lining inner ring, the remaining 15 helices form an outer shell that shields the inner ring from the surrounding lipids. Therefore, the pentameric toroid of Xcc0516 represents a novel quaternary structure formed by four-helix bundle domains. ° The central channel of Xcc0516 pentamer is $23 A in length and funnel-shaped, tapering from an inner diam° ° eter of $16 A at the wider end to $5 A at the narrow end [Fig. 1(B)]. This reduction of channel diameter is apparently a consequence of the kink in helix a2 at Pro54 [Fig. 1(A)], which bends the N-terminal portion of a2 inward toward the five-fold axis and places the loops between helices a1 and a2 (L12) in close proximity [Fig. 1(B)]. As a result, the channel is practically blocked at the narrow end. We speculate that the structure we observed in this study may represent the ``closed'' confor-

ferred to the cryostabilization solution of reservoir buffer plus an additional 20% 1,6-hexanediol for $10 s, and immediately flash-frozen by plunging into liquid N2. Data collection and structure determination.. Diffraction data sets were collected from a single Se-labeled crystal at three different wavelengths at SPring8, Japan (beamline SP12B2, ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector, 100K) and processed using HKL2000.6 Data from each wavelength were indexed according to the same crystal orientation matrix, but were integrated and scaled independently. The structures of Xcc0516 were determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method. Specifically, initial phases were obtained using the program SOLVE.7 These preliminary phases were improved by density modification with the program RESOLVE.8 The resulting experimental electron-density map was of excellent quality, which allowed RESOLVE9,10 to build 548 out of a total of 640 residues in the asymmetric unit. The program O11 and REFMAC512 were then used for rounds of manual model rebuilding and refinement. Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The atomic coordinates and structure factors of Xcc0516 have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with ID code 2GSC. Results and Discussion. Structure of Xcc0516 Monomer.. Crystals of Xcc0516 belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212, with unit-cell parameters a ¼ 87.8 ° ° ° A, b ¼ 104.3 A, and c ¼ 66.5 A and five copies of Xcc0516 (designated chains A through E) in the asymmetric unit. Superposition12 of the five crystallographi° cally independent chains gives an RMSD of 0.52 A between main-chain atoms, indicating that their conformations are generally similar. The final model consists of 567 residues and 156 water molecules and was refined to a final working R-value of 22.0% and a free R-value

mation of the Xcc0516 pentamer, and a gating process is likely required to allow the passage of substances through the narrow end. Sequence alignment of Xcc0516 homologs.. A sequence similarity search with BLAST2 revealed that Xcc0516 belongs to the Ribosomal_S23p protein family (Pfam3 domain PF05635), whose members include the bacterial 23S rRNA proteins13,14 and several conserved hypothetical proteins from a wide variety of bacteria and archaic. Since Xcc0516 can be aligned over its entire length with the Ribosomal_S23p protein family members [Fig. 1(C)], with E values around e-36, and that residues of the hydrophobic core are well conserved, it appears that members of this protein family should fold into four-helix bundles. Sequence analysis further revealed that the Ribosomal_S23p family members are likely to exhibit a

similar pentameric quaternary architecture, as residues involved in Xcc0516 pentamer formation are highly conserved as well. In addition, given that Pro54 is also conserved, the structural similarity among the Ribosomal_S23p family members may further extend to the kink in helix a2 and tapering of the central channel. Although the biological functions of Ribosomal_S23p family members remain to be characterized, the analyses presented here suggest that the central channel and its overall shape are preserved during evolution and thus may have a functional significance. The conservation of many channel-lining residues provides additional support for this perspective. A Western blot analysis suggested that Xcc0516 may be expressed in X. campestris during the log phase (data not shown), and further analyses are being conducted to elucidate the function of this interesting pentamer.
