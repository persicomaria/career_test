Abstract The otsA and otsB genes, encoding trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase respectively, have been isolated from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and nucleotide-sequenced. Induction of trehalose biosynthesis by exposure of bacteria to high osmotic strength resulted in the intracellular accumulation of trehalose. An otsA mutant of S. enterica serovar typhimurium was more susceptible to killing by heat, and grew poorly under conditions of high osmolarity. The wild-type and otsA mutant strains showed similar abilities to colonise spleen tissues after oral dosing of mice. These findings suggest that the otsBA gene products play a role in environmental survival, but not in virulence, of S. enterica serovar typhimurium.  2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

1. Introduction Many bacteria encounter environments with different osmotic strengths and have developed mechanisms which allow survival in these different environments. One mechanism involves the accumulation of K+ ions and organic molecules with osmoprotectant properties such as betaines, sugars and amino acids [6,12,16]. In Escherichia coli glycine-betaine and proline-betaine play the major role in osmoprotection and the Bet system is responsible for the uptake of choline and its subsequent oxidation to glycine betaine [15, 25]. An additional mechanism of osmoprotection involves the biosynthesis of trehalose (O--D-glucopyranosyl(1-1)-D-glucopyranoside) [8,14]. The biosynthesis of trehalose by bacteria is an important element of the so-called starvation-stress response [22] and is partially regulated by RpoS [11,24]. The mechanism of protection by trehalose is not fully elucidated but it is thought to replace water molecules which are normally bound to head groups of membrane phospho* Correspondence and reprints.

lipids and to amino acid side chains. The resultant partial or total exclusion of water molecules and the formation of a water soluble glass around these molecules is thought to prevent damaging Maillard and oxidation reactions while maintaining structure [4,18]. Most previous work has focussed on the ability of trehalose to preserve biological molecules during desiccation [4,9,17]. However, it has also been reported that trehalose protects biological molecules from light, air or thermal stress [13,17,21]. In E. coli the enzymes trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (OtsA) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (OtsB) catalyse the conversion of UDP glucose and glucose-6-phosphate to trehalose [8]. The encoding genes have been nucleotidesequenced and shown to be organised into an operon (otsBA). The biosynthesis of trehalose in E. coli is associated with exposure of the bacteria to environmental stresses such as high osmotic strength [8]. Previous studies have also shown that Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium LT2 is also able to synthesise trehalose in response to elevated osmotic strength [2,8]. Separately it has been shown that an otsA mutant of S. enterica serovar typhimurium strain 14028s showed reduced osmotolerance [7]. However, this mutant did not show altered susceptibility to thermal stress

and was virulent in mice when given by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) challenge route [7]. We have constructed an otsA mutant of S. enterica serovar typhimurium strain SL1344 and determined the response of this mutant to osmotic and thermal stress. In addition, we considered that trehalose biosynthesis might play a role in virulence of S. enterica serovar typhimurium which normally infects the host after ingestion. Within the gut, and before uptake by M-cells lining the gut, the bacterium is exposed to a range of conditions including high osmolarity [3,19]. To examine this possibility we have determined the virulence of the mutant when given by the oral challenge route.

an inverse PCR with DNA which had been digested with AatII or AseI and ligated. 2.4. Nucleotide sequencing Sequencing reactions were carried out using an ABI 800 Molecular Biology LabStation CATALYST (PE Applied Biosystems Ltd, Warrington, UK) with rhodamine dye terminator sequencing (PE Applied Biosystems Ltd, Warrington, UK). The samples were analysed using an ABI373 nucleotide sequencing system (PE Applied Biosystems Ltd, Warrington, UK). The nucleotide sequence reported here has been deposited with GenBank under the accession number AF213176. 2.5. Determination of the intracellular trehalose concentration Approximately 109 cells were suspended in 1 ml 70% (v/v) ethanol. To this, 0.05 mg sucrose was added as internal reference. Trehalose extraction was carried out at 70  C for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged at 18 000 g for 5 min and the supernatant collected. An equal volume of water was added followed by 250 µl of chloroform. After centrifugation (5 min, 18 000 g) the aqueous phase was collected and dried. Samples were derivatized at 55  C for 2 h with 100 µl of an equal mix of pyridine and N,O,-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetimide plus 1% trimethylchlorosilane (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Gas chromatography was carried out on a Perkin Elmer AutoSystem XL fitted with a 30 m × 0.25 mm DB-5 column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 50 ml/min. Injector and detector were set at 320  C and column temperature was set at 100  C for the first 2 min, increased at 45  C/min up to 260  C and then ramped at 4  C/min up to a final temperature of 290  C and held for a further 3 min. The trehalose concentration was determined with reference to calibration standards of trehalose, glucose, sucrose and maltose at concentrations from 2.5 µM to 1 mM. 2.6. Construction of an otsA mutant A DNA fragment including the 5 region of the otsA gene was generated using the PCR (30 cycles of 96  C, 30 s; 60  C, 30 s; 72  C, 30 s) with primers 5 GTACGCGTCGACGCAGAGCGTCGTGACATCAATG3 and 5 AAAACTGCAGCTCATCCTCGTTACCTGTCTC3 with S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 template DNA. A DNA fragment including the 3 region of the otsA gene was generated using the PCR with primers 5 GATGAGATTGCTCTGCAGGCT3 and 5 CGCCGAGCTCCGCTCCTGCCAGCGGTTAATGT3 with the reaction conditions described above. The PCR primers included PstI and SacI sites. The amplified DNA fragments were digested, ligated with a PstI digested kanamycin resistance cassette (Pharmacia Biotech,

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Enzymes and chemicals Unless stated, chemicals and enzymes were obtained from the Sigma Chemical Company (Poole, UK) or from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Lewes, UK). 2.2. Culture of bacteria E. coli JM109, E. coli CC118 and S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 were maintained on L-agar [20]. S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 was grown aerobically, at 37  C in 100 ml of L-broth [20] or in minimal medium (Na2 HPO4 ·H2 0,12.8 g/l; KH2 PO4 , 3 g/l; NaCl, 0.5 g/l; NH4 Cl, 1 g/l; glucose, 1% w/v; CaCl2 , 50 µM; MgSO4 , 50 µM; histidine, 40 mg/l; pH 7.0) or (Na2 HPO4 , 6 g/l; KH2 PO4 , 3 g/l; NH4 Cl, 1 g/l; NaCl, 0.5 g/l; MgSO4 , 1 mM; CaCl2 , 0.13 mM; glucose, 1% w/v; FeSO4 , 0.15 mM; ZnSO4 , 0.15 mM; MnSO4 , 0.15 mM; pH 7.0). Trehalose induction medium consisted of minimal medium containing 29 g/l NaCl. The optical density at 600 nm of the culture (OD600nm) was used as an indicator of bacterial growth. 2.3. Isolation of otsA and otsB genes DNA was isolated [20] from S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344. Oligonucleotides (5 ACCAGRTTCATMCCRTC3 and 5 RTICAYGATTAYCAYYT3 ) were used for the PCR amplification (30 cycles of 94  C, 60 s; 40  C, 60 s; 60  C, 30 s) of a fragment of the otsA gene which was cloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). An upstream DNA fragment was amplified using the PCR (30 cycles of 94  C, 60 s; 38  C, 60 s; 56  C, 60 s) with a degenerate upstream primer (5 ATGACIATGWSIMGIYTIGT3 ) and a specific internal primer (5 ACATTTTTCAGTTCCGCCTT3 ). A downstream DNA fragment was amplified using a similar methodology with primers 5 CAGACAGAAGTGTATCCTAT3 and 5 YYAIGCIARYTTIGGRAA3 . Amplified DNA was cloned into pT7-blue (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK). DNA fragments flanking these regions were amplified using

St Albans) and ligated into pGEM-T-easy (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The cloned DNA fragment was isolated from purified recombinant plasmid using SacI and SalI, ligated with suitably restricted plasmid pCVD442 and transformed into E. coli CC118 (pir). The mutated gene was transferred into S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 by conjugation with E. coli S17 containing pNJ5000 as a helper strain. Mutants were selected on L-agar containing 5% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mM glycine-betaine, histidine and kanamycin. Seven kanamycin-resistant ampicillin-sensitive mutants were identified. The identity of these mutants was confirmed using the PCR from colony lysates with oligonucleotides which flanked the otsA gene. 2.7. Thermal and osmotic tolerance S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 or SL1344otsA were cultured overnight at 37  C in M9 minimal medium, the cultures centrifuged (4 000 g, 22  C, 20 min) and the bacterial cells re-suspended in 0.15M NaCl at 22  C at an OD600nm of 1.00­1.05. One ml aliquots of the suspension were incubated at 50oC and at intervals samples were removed, diluted in 0.15 M NaCl at 22  C and inoculated onto L-agar plates. After incubation (37  C, 18 h) bacterial colonies were counted. To investigate growth in the presence of NaCl, 200-ml volumes of M9 minimal medium containing 0.5 M NaCl were inoculated with the washed SL1344 or SL1344 otsBA bacteria, so that the OD600nm of the culture was 0.05. The cultures were incubated at 37  C with shaking (200 rpm) and growth measured at hourly intervals up to 30 h postinoculation. 2.8. Intragastric competition challenge First, S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 or SL1344otsA were cocultured in vitro. Five ml of L-broth was inoculated with approximately 104 CFUs of each strain and the number of bacteria determined after plating suitable dilutions on to L-agar or onto L-agar containing kanamycin. After incubation (18 h, 37  C) the number of viable bacteria was again determined as described. For in vivo competition studies, S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 or SL1344 otsA were cultured in L-broth to an OD600nm of approximately 0.6. After centrifugation (10 000 g, 15 min, 4  C) of 20 ml of culture the cell pellet was resuspended in L-broth to an OD600nm of 0.62 (approximately 1 × 109 CFU/ml). The precise number of viable cells was determined by plating dilutions onto L-agar or L-agar containing kanamycin. Six female BALB/c mice were dosed intragastrically with 100 µl of a mixture of S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 and SL1344 otsA. Four days later, the mice were sacrificed and the spleens removed and each homogenised in 10 ml of PBS (pH 7.2). The number of viable cells was determined by plating onto L-agar or L-agar containing kanamycin. The competitive index was calculated as the number of SL1344 otsA bacteria/number of SL1344 in

spleen samples divided by the number of SL1344 otsA bacteria/number of SL1344 in the intragastric dosing inoculum.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the trehalose biosynthesis operon An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the OtsA proteins from E. coli, Aspergillis niger, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida albicans was used to identify regions of amino acid sequence identity (V/IHDYHL and RDGMNLV). Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed from these conserved regions and used in the PCR to amplify a 716bp DNA fragment from S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was used to design new oligonucleotide primers which were used to obtain the remainder of the otsA gene, the entire otsB gene and upstream and downstream DNA sequence. In total 3369 bp of nucleotide sequence was obtained. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence obtained revealed the presence of two open reading frames which would encode 473 and 267 (respectively) amino acid proteins. These genes were identified as the otsA and otsB genes on the basis of deduced amino acid sequence homology (88% and 72% identity, respectively) with the E. coli OtsA and OtsB proteins [8]. The otsA gene was located 3 to the otsB gene and the genes overlapped by 23 nucleotides (Fig. 1). This organisation is similar to that reported in E. coli [8] and suggests that the S. enterica serovar typhimurium genes form a single transcriptional unit, the otsBA operon. 3.2. Construction of an otsA mutant of S. enterica serovar typhimurium We have shown previously that trehalose biosynthesis in S. enterica serovar typhimurium, was accompanied by increased resistance to desiccation damage [1]. To investigate the role of trehalose biosynthesis in S. enterica serovar typhimurium, an otsA mutant of S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 was constructed. The mutated otsA gene (SL1344 otsA) contained a 559-bp deletion within the 5 region of otsA and the gene was also insertionally inactivated by a cassette encoding resistance to kanamycin. Transconjugants containing the mutated gene, as a result of a double crossover event, were identified on the basis of loss of ampicillin resistance and retention of kanamycin resistance. The double cross-over event was facilitated when bacteria were cultured on agar containing 1 mM glycine-betaine. To confirm the genetic identity of these mutants, PCR amplification from colony lysates was undertaken with primers designed from the 5 region of the otsB gene and the 3 region of the otsA gene. Whereas wild-type strains contained a

1.98-kbp fragment, the mutant bacteria (SL1344 otsA) contained only a 2.6-kbp DNA fragment which contained the kanamycin resistance gene. Seven mutants were identified, and two were selected for further studies.

3.4. Thermal and osmotic tolerance of S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 and SL1344 otsA Previous workers have shown that in comparison with the wild-type strain, an otsA mutant of S. enterica serovar typhimurium LT2 was deficient in growth at 45  C in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl [2]. However an otsA mutant of S. enterica serovar typhimurium strain 14028s has been reported to be as resistant as the wild-type to heating to 55  C for up to 6 min though a small difference in the survival of the mutant and wild type (12.4% and 18.8%, respectively) was observed after 10 min [7]. In this study S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 and SL1344 otsA, which had been cultured in minimal medium, were incubated at 50  C and the number of viable bacterial cells determined at intervals. After 7 min the number of viable cells of S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 otsA had decreased to 0.6% of the starting cell density, whereas the wild-type strain retained 8% viability (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained when a second mutant was tested for thermal tolerance. These findings indicate that the otsBA operon plays a significant role in resistance to thermal killing and suggest that even the basal level of trehalose biosynthesis in uninduced wild-type cells is sufficient to provide protection against thermal stress. It is not clear why our results differ from those reported by Fang et al. [7]. However, strain SL1344 appears to be more susceptible to thermal killing than strain 14028s. Therefore it is possible that other mechanisms of thermal tolerance operate in strain 14028s which mask the effects of the otsA mutation. To investigate the sensitivity of S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 or SL1344 otsA to osmolarity, bacteria were inoculated into minimal medium containing 0.5 M

3.3. Trehalose biosynthesis by S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 and SL1344 otsA

In E. coli trehalose biosynthesis can be induced by culturing the bacteria under conditions of high osmolarity [8,16,23]. S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 and SL1344 otsA, which had been cultured for 28 h in minimal medium or minimal medium containing 0.5 M NaCl were harvested and disrupted. The soluble fraction was analysed for trehalose and sucrose using gas chromatography (Fig. 2). Trehalose was identified in extracts from S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 and the level of trehalose was higher in cells which had been cultured in medium containing 0.5 M NaCl. In contrast, trehalose was not detected in S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 otsA cells which had been cultured in either minimal medium or minimal medium containing 0.5 M NaCl. It is known that different strains of E. coli produce different amounts of trehalose [2,5]. The level of trehalose in cells of S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 which had been cultured in medium containing 0.5 M NaCl was 200 µg/109 cells, indicating an intracellular concentration of approximately 400 mM. This is similar to the highest concentrations of trehalose found in cells of some E. coli strains [5].

NaCl or minimal medium containing 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mM betaine. S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 was able to grow in either medium, with the culture reaching an OD600nm of 3.5 units after 30 h. When S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 otsA was cultured in minimal medium containing 0.5 M NaCl the OD600nm after 30 h was only 0.5 units. However, the ability to grow at a similar rate to the wild-type strain was restored when bacteria were cultured in medium also supplemented with 1 mM betaine. Similar results were obtained when a second SL1344 otsA mutant

was tested for osmotic tolerance. This finding confirms the previous studies which showed that betaine was able to protect trehalose biosynthesis mutants of E. coli [8] or S. typhimurium LT2 [2] from osmotic stress. 3.5. Virulence of S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 otsA The virulence of an otsA mutant of S. enterica serovar typhimurium strain 14028s has been shown to be similar to

of bacteria exposed to environmental stress. It is possible that trehalose biosynthesis contributes to the ability of the bacterium to survive in the soil, or in partially cooked foodstuffs. Further work is underway to investigate these possibilities. Heithoff et al. [10] have previously used in vivo expression technology to identify otsA as one of the genes whose level of expression is upregulated in the small intestine of mice challenged by the i.g. route. These findings suggest that the conditions in the gut present a sufficient stress to result in the induction of trehalose biosynthesis. However, we have found that the otsBA gene products do not appear to contribute directly to the virulence of S. enterica serovar typhimurium when given to mice by the same route. It is possible that this induction of a general stress response in bacteria in the gut results in the fortuitous expression of otsBA. Alternatively, it is possible that additional stress responses are able to compensate for the loss of the ability to synthesis trehalose by the mutant that we have tested, thereby masking the role of the otsBA genes in virulence.

that of the parental strain when given by the intraperitoneal route [7]. However, we considered that it would be meaningful to compare virulence when the bacteria were given by the oral route. As an enteric pathogen, the bacterium encounters a wide variety of environmental conditions. In the external environment the osmolarity is low whereas in the gut the osmolarity is high. It is known that porin (OmpC and OmpF) expression in both E. coli and S. typhimurium is regulated by osmolarity [19]. When given by the oral route ompC mutants are attenuated 100-fold, but only attenuated 10-fold when given by the i.v. route [3]. In preliminary studies S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 and SL1344 otsA were cocultured in L-broth. Equal numbers of bacteria were recovered, indicating that the otsA gene did not provide a competitive growth advantage in a complex growth medium. To investigate whether the otsA gene provided a growth advantage in vivo, BALB/c mice were dosed intragastrically with a mixture of S. enterica serovar typhimurium SL1344 and SL1344 otsA. The ratio of the numbers of mutant bacteria and wild-type bacteria in the intragastric dose was 0.72. Spleens were removed from these animals four days after dosing contained 9 × 102 to 4 × 104 CFUs of S. enterica serovar typhimurium. The ratio of the numbers of mutant bacteria and wild-type bacteria isolated from the spleen was 1.1 indicating that an otsA mutant of S. enterica serovar typhimurium was not attenuated when given by the oral route. Overall our findings indicate that the otsBA operon in S. enterica serovar typhimurium plays a role in survival of the bacterium in the environment. Previous workers have shown that the otsA gene is regulated by RpoS, a master regulator of the bacterial response to stresses such as nutrient deprivation or to the stationary phase of growth [7,11]. The functions of otsBA gene products, which we have identified in this report, would be expected to contribute to the survival
