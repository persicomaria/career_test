ABSTRACT The coding sequence for the first N-terminal copper binding motif of the human Menkes disease protein (MNK1; residues 2­79) was synthesized, cloned, and expressed in bacteria for biochemical and structural studies. MNK1 adopts the fold common to all the metal binding sequences (MBS) found in other metal transport systems (e.g., the yeast copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase CCS, the yeast copper chaperone ATX1 bound to Hg(II), and most recently Cu(I), the bacterial copper binding protein, CopZ, and the bacterial Hg(II) binding protein MerP), although substantial differences were found in the metal binding loop. Similar to ATX1, MNK1 binds Cu(I) in a distorted linear bicoordinate geometry. As with MerP, MNK1 has a high affinity for both Hg(II) and Cu(I), although it displays a marked preference for Cu(I). In addition, we found that F71 is a key residue in the compact folding of MNK1, and its mutation to alanine results in an unfolded structure. The homologous residue in MerP has also been mutated with similar results. Finally, to understand the relationship between protein folding and metal affinity and specificity, we expressed a chimeric MBS with the MNK1 protein carrying the binding motif of MerP (CAAC-MNK1); this chimeric protein showed differences in structure and the dynamics of the binding site that may account for metal specificity.

Key words: Menkes disease; copper binding; NMR spectroscopy; MerP INTRODUCTION Trace amounts of copper are essential for the proper functioning of many proteins; however, excess copper is deleterious because it forms toxic organic and oxygen radicals that damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. As a result, it is crucial for biological organisms to regulate the transporting and sequestering of copper to maintain the appropriate concentrations and oxidation states in cells.1,2 P-type ATPases in Copper Homeostasis An important class of proteins involved in transporting copper across cell membranes is the P-type or CPx-type

ATPases3,4 that have been found in yeast, bacteria, and mammals. P-type ATPases are characterized by several structural features: an ATP binding domain, a phosphorylation domain containing an invariant aspartic acid residue, a transduction domain, a phosphatase domain, and a transmembrane region containing a CPC sequence that is proposed to translocate metal ions across the membrane.5 In addition, there are six highly homologous metal-binding domains near the N-terminus, known as metal binding sequences (MBS), which have about 80 residues and a highly conserved MXCXXC sequence in the metal-binding loop.6 The first MBS of the Menkes-associated ATPase (MNK1) is the subject of the structural studies described in this article. The structures of the fourth MBS bound to Ag(I)7 and recently the second MBS bound to Cu(I)8,9 have been reported. Menkes and Wilson Diseases Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder that results in copper deficiency; cellular copper export is disrupted in most tissues, although it remains normal in the liver.10,11 Wilson disease is characterized by toxicity due to excess copper in the liver, brain, and cornea. These diseases result from mutations in two different P-type ATPases responsible for copper export (Menkes (ATP7A); Wilson (ATP7B), both of which have six MBS domains. Copper-binding MBS polypeptides are found as individual proteins and as domains of larger and more complex proteins including HAH1, a human copper chaperone, which interacts with the cytoplasmic metal binding domains of the Menkes and Wilson ATPases,12 CCS, the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase,13 and Atx1, the yeast copper chaperone for Ccc2, a P-type ATPase.14

They are also found in bacterial copper binding proteins such as CopA,4 and Cop Z.15 MerP from the Mercury Detoxification System MerP, a 72-residue protein found in the periplasm of bacteria containing the operon for the bacterial mercury detoxification system, was the first MBS whose structure was determined.16 It has a fold with two -helices superimposed on a four-stranded antiparallel -sheet. Structures of the Hg(II) bound and reduced forms of MerP show that differences due to metal binding are relatively minor, and are localized to the metal binding loop and nearby regions, which include the first helix, the Cterminus of the first -sheet, the N-terminus of the third -sheet, the turn between the second and third -sheet, and the turn between the second helix and the fourth -sheet.199Hg NMR data show that the metal ion binds to the sulfur atoms of two Cys side chains with linear bicoordinate geometry. The structure of the oxidized form of MerP, where the two cysteines in the metal binding loop form a disulfide bridge, has also been determined by NMR, and it was found to be very similar to that of the metalbound form.17 MerP is a component of the bacterial mercury detoxification system.18 The detoxification of mercury involves several proteins whose sequences are encoded in the mer operon and whose expression is regulated by the MerR repressor protein. MerP binds mercury in the periplasm and transfers it to the membrane proteins MerT or MerF that transport the metal across the membrane into the cytoplasm where the enzyme mercuric reductase reduces Hg(II) to Hg(0). The MBSs in P-type ATPases have 39 ­54% sequence identities to MerP, even though MerP is a bacterial mercury binding protein and the ATPases are involved in copper metabolism in humans. The ATPases contain transmembrane segments responsible for transporting copper into the cell. In contrast, the bacterial mercury detoxification system relies on separate membrane proteins to transport mercury into the cell after it is bound to the MBS.19 Structural Biology of Metal Binding Sequences (MBS) All of the MBS structures have the same fold. However, the differences between their apo and metal bound forms of the metal binding loops are somewhat variable. The details of metal ligand coordination and how residues in the metal binding loop may affect the geometry of this interaction are critical for elucidating the biological function for these proteins. The proteins have generally been shown to bind metals through the two Cys side chains in a bicoordinate manner. However, EXAFS studies of Cu(I)-ATX120 suggested the possibility of a third ligand in the metal binding site besides the two sulfur ligands from cysteines. The three-dimensional structure of ATX1 bound to Hg(II) was originally determined by X-ray crystallography; the high resolution structure of the metal binding site showed that the metal is bound in a linear bicoordinate fashion with a bond angle of 167° for the two sulfurs in the

cysteines and the oxygen side chain of Thr14 and Ser16 were close to the metal site.21 The three-dimensional solution structure of Atx1 bound to Cu(I) shows that the S­Cu­S angle is 120 40°, also suggesting that the Cu(I) may have a 2 coordination,22 although 199Hg NMR spectroscopy shows a chemical shift consistent with a linear dithiolate compound.20 The structure of the amino terminal MBS of Ccc2, a P-type ATPase, which is the counterpart for the copper chaperone Atx1, was determined by solution NMR bound to Cu(I).23 Unlike Cu(I)Atx1 and other MBS proteins, the metal binding residues of Ccc2 are on the surface of the first helix. The threedimensional solution structure of the bacterial copper binding MBS, CopZ, from Bacillus subtilis was also determined by NMR spectroscopy, and the SOCu(I)OS bond makes an angle of 115 26°.24 Although the authors speculate that a third donor atom could be contributed by DTT, they also mention the possibility of partial donor atoms from amino acid sidechains that approach the metal binding site. EXAFS studies of the cytoplasmic binding domains of the Menkes and Wilson proteins bound to Cu(I) show a 2-coordinate all-sulfur environment; however, a possible weak association of a third distant ligand in the metal site besides the dithiolate coordination has been discussed.9,25­27,46 The SOCu(I)OS bond angle was found to be 140 40° in the NMR determined structure of the second MBS domain of ATP7A, MNK2.28 All MBS structures determined thus far show some distortion from the 180° SOCuOS angle expected from a linear dithiolate coordination, and this may have some functional significance in copper trafficking between metallochaperones and their specific target proteins. In this article, we describe the structure of the first metal binding domain (MNK1) of the Menkes protein bound to Cu(I). Spectroscopic studies of mutant proteins demonstrate a key residue involved in protein stability for both MNK1 and MerP. The global fold of MNK1 is a fold, and structural differences of the metal bound form are localized to the metal binding loop and its surrounding regions. The Cu(I) ion binds to sulfur groups of the two cysteine residues for a linear bicoordinate metal center that deviates somewhat from 180°. The potential roles of other ligands near the metal binding site are also discussed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Preparation and Characterization of MNK1 The coding sequence for the polypeptide corresponding to MNK1, residues 2­79, was synthesized, cloned into the pMal-c2 vector, and expressed as a fusion protein in bacteria. The MNK1 domain was cleaved and purified from its maltose binding fusion protein with Factor Xa. Cleavage at the Factor Xa site generated a polypeptide with four additional amino acid residues at the Nterminus of MNK1. Backbone amide resonances from three of the four residues (because one of the amino acids is at the N-terminus) are observed in two-dimensional 1H15 N HSQC and three-dimensional 1H-15N-edited NOESY spectra; however, they display no long-range NOEs, sug-

gesting that they are not structured. These results are consistent with those for the extra amino acids that remained attached to MerP after cleavage.16 NMR Spectroscopy of MNK1 (Sequential Connectivities and Long-Range NOEs) Each amide site in uniformly 15N labeled MNK1 contributes a single correlation resonance to the two-dimensional 1 H-15N HSQC spectrum in Figure 1(A), excluding the four prolines because they contain imino groups, and residues

Thr18 and Ser21 in the GMTCNSC metal-binding sequence. Although resonances from Thr18 and Ser21 are not observable in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of apoMNK1, they are present in the spectrum of the Cu(I) bound form [Fig. 1(B)] of the protein, suggesting that these residues in the metal binding loop undergo motions on time scales different from the rest of the protein, at least in the metal-free form of the protein. Sequential resonance assignments of apo-MNK1 were made using standard triple-resonance experiments.29 A

CT-HNCA experiment was performed to correlate amide 1 H and 15N chemical shifts with the intra-residue 13C chemical shift as well as the 13C chemical shift of the preceding residue. Some residues have very similar -carbon chemical shifts, or the -carbon chemical shifts of the strong and weak peaks are degenerate, therefore, CTHN(CO)CA and the CBCA(CO)NH experiments were needed to complete the resonance assignments. The CBCA(CO)NH and the CT-HN(CO)CA experiments provide sequential -carbon correlations; however, the CBCA(CO)NH experiment has the added benefit of providing the -carbon chemical shifts, which are generally more distinctive than the -carbon chemical shifts. Sequential connectivities were made by aligning the -carbon chemical shifts of the intra- and interresidue peaks. Spin system assignments were made by comparing three-dimensional 1H-15N TOCSY and 1H-15N NOESY experiments. Any ambiguities in the secondary structure assignment from the triple resonance data were resolved by observing the interresidue correlations in the 15N-edited NOESY spectrum. Side-chain aromatic intra- and interresidue connectivities were identified in 1H-1H TOCSY and NOESY spectra obtained from samples in D2O. Long-range 1H-1H NOEs were crucial for determining the global fold of the protein through helix­ helix and sheet­ helix contacts. Peak intensities from 15N-edited NOESY and the 1H-1H NOESY spectra were used in the structure determination. The three-dimensional structure of reduced and Cu(I) bound MNK1 was determined using the standard Simulated Annealing protocol included in the program XPLOR.30 In addition, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were determined for both the free and the copper-bound forms of MNK1 using Pf1 phage as an alignment medium. The RDCs were used in the final step of the refinement protocol and introduced as harmonic constraints using the Tjan-

dra31 approach. The addition of RDCs remarkably enhanced the resolution of the structures by substantially improving both the covalent geometry and the precision of the loop regions that were not so well defined by NOEs. A plot of RDCs for both the apo and Cu(I) bound forms of MNK1 is included as Figure A in Supplementary information. Secondary Structure from NMR Data The chemical shift index data32,33 calculated from 13C edited triple resonance experiments used for sequential resonance assignments, predicted that MNK1 has two -helices and four -sheets. The summary of short and medium range NOEs also shows the presence of two -helices as indicated by the presence of N(i,i 3) and N(i,i 4), strong NN(i,i 1), (i,i 3) NOEs. The two helices involve residues 22­28 ( 1) and 61­71 ( 2). NOE data also confirms the presence of four antiparallel sheets as indicated by strong N(i 1) and only weak NN(i 1). The four sheets involve residues 7­15 ( 1), 36 ­ 41 ( 2), 47­52 ( 3), and 72­75 ( 4). Metal binding to MNK1 does not affect the secondary structure of the protein because the same secondary structural elements are present in both the copper free and bound states. Description of the apo-MNK1 and of Cu(I) Bound MNK1 Structures The superposition of backbones of the 15 lowest energy structures, which had no NOE violations greater than 0.4 Å, no bond length violations greater than 0.05 Å, and no bond or dihedral angles greater than 5°, for apo and Cu(I) bound MNK1 are represented in Figure 2. The apo MNK1 conformers were derived from a total of 782 restraints, including 642 NOEs, 56 hydrogen bond restraints, 39 dihedral restraints, and 45 JHN residual dipolar couplings

(Table I). A total of 767 restraints derived from NMR experiments were used to determine Cu(I) bound MNK1 including 625 NOEs, 55 hydrogen bond restraints, 40 dihedral restraints, and 40 JHN residual dipolar couplings (Table I). The structures generated from the refinement protocol were analyzed and the structural statistics are presented in Table I. The global fold of MNK1 results from two -helices, 1 and 2 (residues 22­28 and 61­71), stacked on four antiparallel -sheets 1, 2, 3, and 4 (residues 7­15, 36 ­ 41, 47­52, and 72­75, respectively). The -helices have an interhelical angle of approximately 54°. The metal binding site is positioned between helix 1 and sheet 1, with C19 located in the loop region and C22 in the first turn of helix 1. The average SOCu(I)OS bond angle for the calculated structures of MNK1 is 170° (SD 4.1°); thus, there is a 10° deviation from a 180° linear dithiolate SOCu(I)OS coordination. The three-dimensional structure of the metal binding loop, highlighting the Cu(I) ion coordinating two sulfur ligands (yellow) from cysteines, is shown in Figure 3(A). An expanded view of the metal binding loop [Fig. 3(B)] shows the side chain O of Thr 18 and Ser 21, the backbone O of Cys 19 and Ser 21, and the backbone N of Cys 19 and Cys 22 indicated by an asterisk (*). The O of Thr 18 and Ser 21 is less than 2.5 Å from the Cu(I) ion in most of the calculated structures, which approaches the distance for secondary bonding interactions. Also, the nitrogens of Cys 19 and Cys 22, and the backbone oxygens of Cys 19 and Ser 21 are less than 2.5 Å from the metal site in most structures. The substantial number of NOEs observed between F71 and residues in the metal binding site suggests that this residue plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the binding loop. The M17 sulfur atom in Cu(I)

bound MNK1 is 8.0 Å from the metal ion; thus, it is not involved in metal coordination. The global RMSDs for the free and the metal-bound forms are reported in Table I. A histogram of the RMSD for each residue is included in the Supplementary information as Figure B. There are no major changes in the secondary structure elements of MNK1 after metal binding, with the exception of the metal binding site (loop1) and a slight unwinding of helix 2; helix 1 is well defined in both the free and bound forms. Therefore, changes resulting from metal binding seem to be localized to the binding site and not propagated throughout the polypeptide. The structures of both the apo and Cu(I) bound forms have been deposited in the RCSB protein data bank (Entry numbers: 1KVI and 1KVJ). And the data have been deposited as BMRB­12897. Mutagenesis Studies All of the MBS domains of the Menkes and Wilson ATPases have a highly conserved phenylalanine residue near the C-terminus. In MerP, the bacterial mercury binding protein, a tyrosine is located in the corresponding position. These aromatic side chains have a large number of contacts with residues in the metal binding loop, as well as those in helix 1, as determined by their NOEs and the resulting solution NMR structures. To examine the roles of these aromatic side chains in stabilizing the structures of a copper binding protein and a mercury binding protein with the same global fold, F71 in MNK1 and Y66 in MerP were replaced by alanines. The wild-type MNK1 and F71A MNK1 polypeptides migrate to the same position in SDSPAGE; however, they have different retention times on a gel filtration column, suggesting differences in their Stoke's radii. Because F71A MNK1 elutes faster than wild-type MNK1, it appears to occupy a larger molecular volume. Likewise, wild-type MerP and Y66A MerP polypeptides migrate to the same position in SDS-PAGE, and Y66A MerP elutes faster than wild-type MerP on a gel filtration column, suggesting that it too occupies a larger molecular volume. To further characterize protein unfolding, two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were obtained on F71A MNK1 [Fig. 1(C)] and Y66A MerP [Fig. 1(D)] polypeptides in solution. Many of the correlation peaks are missing in the spectra of the mutated proteins, suggesting that F71A MNK1 and Y66A MerP have increased fluctuations in the

whole protein, which results in a partially unfolded state and dynamic conformations in solution. Because there is no extra line broadening apparent in the observable resonances, aggregation does not seem to be a plausible explanation. Rather, it appears that this highly conserved aromatic sidechain facing the metal binding loop contributes importantly to the stability of a substantial portion of the protein structure. Metal Binding to MNK1 Metal binding to MNK1 was characterized by measuring the reduction in the CD absorbance at 222 nm as described previously.34,47 This effect is due to a slight unwinding of the first -helix of MNK1 upon metal binding. A similar result was observed for the MerP protein.16 Dissociation constants of MNK1 for several different metals were calculated from the titration curves with increasing amounts of metal (Table II). Dissociation constants include those for Cu(I), Hg(II), and Ag(I), which prefer a linear bicoordinate geometry, as well as for Cd(II) and Ni(II), which generally bind proteins in an octahedral fashion. A comparison of metal binding constants shows that MNK1 has a higher binding affinity for Cu(I) than MerP. Also, Cd(II) and Ni(II) bind to MNK1 with a twofold

higher affinity than to MerP. The metal binding loops of MerP (GMTCAAC) and MNK1 (GMTCNSC) are similar; however, differences in metal binding could result from effects of the specific amino acids located between the cysteines in the metal binding loop or from highly conserved aromatic amino acids residues, which are also conserved in MBS. These aromatic residues may influence the loop to assume a specific orientation for metal binding. For instance, in the apo form of MerP, the side chain of residue F38, located in the turn between -sheets 2 and 3, points toward the metal binding loop. However, in the Hg(II) bound form of MerP, the F38 side chain points away from the loop. The movement of the F38 side chain

between the apo and bound forms of the protein could serve to modulate absolute or relative affinities of metal ions. The copper binding proteins MNK1, MNK2, MNK4, ATX1, yCcc2, and CopZ have a highly conserved leucine residue in the corresponding position. The six MBS domains of ATP7A have been shown to bind Cu(I) via two sulfur atoms with linear bicoordinate geometry in an EXAFS study.25,27 199Hg NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the coordination geometry of MNK1. 199Hg has a large chemical shift range ( 3000 ppm) and its resonance frequency is sensitive to the type, number, and geometric arrangement of its ligands. Our previous 199Hg NMR studies of MerP containing the GMTCAAC metal-binding sequence, measured a chemical shift of 816 ppm, which is consistent with that expected for linear bicoordinate dithiolate coordination ( 790 to 1000 ppm).16 Similar results were observed for ATX1, a copper chaperone containing the MTCSGC metal-binding sequence, which has a 199Hg chemical shift of 821 ppm.20 In contrast, the chemical shift of 199Hg bound to MerR, a metalloregulatory protein in the mercury detoxification system was found to be 106 ppm, which is within the range observed for tricoordinate thiolate compounds.35 The chemical shift of 199Hg bound to MNK1 is 850 ppm, which is clearly in the range for a linear dithiolate coordination (Fig. 4). This indicates that the sulfur atoms of the two cysteines bind Cu(I) with linear bicoordinate geometry, which is consistent with EXAFS data observed for the six metal binding motifs of the Menkes protein.25,27 To study the Cu(I) bound form, a 1-mM sample of uniformly 15N-labeled MNK1 containing a 10-fold excess of DTT to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) was titrated with a solution of copper sulfate. No chemical shift changes were observed by NMR beyond a 1:1 molar ratio of protein to metal; however, a 1.5-fold excess of metal was added to ensure complete saturation of metal bound to protein. Because the resonances from all backbone sites, excluding Thr18 and Ser22, of the reduced form of MNK1 have been identified and assigned using triple resonance experiments, it is possible to identify those residues affected by metal binding by inspection of the chemical shift changes in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra. An overlay of the two-dimensional HSQC spectra of a 1-mM solution of reduced MNK1 (black) and a 1-mM solution of MNK1 in 1.5 mM Cu(I) (red) is shown in Figure 1(B). Only those resonances that change chemical shift upon addition of Cu(I) are labeled. Some chemical shift changes of specific residues were difficult to follow due to overlap; therefore, 15 N-edited TOCSY and NOESY spectra of Cu(I) bound MNK1 were used to identify spin systems and to confirm NH-NH connectivities. This was particularly important for the amide chemical shifts of Thr18 and Ser21 resonances that appear upon metal binding, but are absent in the spectrum of the apo form of MNK1. The residues whose resonances undergo chemical shift changes upon addition of copper were mapped onto the structure of the reduced form of MNK1 to identify regions of the molecule that were affected by Cu(I) binding. Chemical shift changes were localized to resonances from residues in the metal binding

loop and surrounding regions, which include the first helix, the second -sheet, the turn between the second and third -sheet, and the turn between the second helix and the fourth -sheet. These regions are shown in magenta and the residues not affected by Cu(I) binding are in blue [Fig. 5(A)]. Similar structural differences upon metal binding were observed in the Hg(II) form of MerP,16 the Ag(I) form of MNK4,7 and the Cu(I) bound form of MNK2.28 Because Ag(I) binds to MNK4 and Hg(II) binds to MerP with linear dithiolate coordination, changes in chemical shift upon addition of these metals to reduced MNK1 were observed in a 1H-15N two-dimensional HSQC spectrum. The HN and H chemical shift changes upon addition of Hg(II) and Ag(I) to reduced MNK1 were plotted to show differences in secondary structure. Comparison of the secondary structure plots for titration of MNK1 with Hg(II), Ag(I), and Cu(I) show very similar HN and H chemical shift changes [Fig. 5(B)]. To better study copper binding to the two cysteine residues in the metal binding loop, we prepared MNK1 with selectively 15N labeled cysteines. The HSQC spectrum of 15N-Cys labeled in MNK1 shows two distinct correlation peaks corresponding to Cys 19 and Cys 22 [Fig. 6(A)]. After addition of 0.2 mM Cu(I) to a 1-mM solution of 15 N-Cys MNK1, a second metal bound peak is observed for C19, slightly resolved from the nonmetal bound peak. A second metal bound peak appears for C22, which has a considerably different chemical shift compared to the nonmetal bound peak [Fig. 6(B)]. After addition of 0.8 mM Cu(I), most of the apo C22 intensity shifts to the metal bound state, although it is clear that there is some residual apo C22 intensity in the spectrum as well [Fig. 6(C)]. The apo C19 peak, after addition of 0.8 mM Cu(I), appears to have completely shifted to the position of the metal bound peak; however, because the apo and metal bound peaks are not well resolved it is likely that there is some residual apo C19 intensity [Fig. 6(C)]. After addition of sufficient Cu(I) to the sample for a 1:1 molar ratio of protein to metal, the apo C22 peak has completely shifted to the metal bound form. Figure 6(D) shows the spectra from samples with the 1:1 molar ratio of Cu(I) bound 15N-Cys MNK1 overlayed with the apo 15N-Cys labeled MNK1. These data show that at lower copper concentrations there are two distinct conformations of the binding loop in slow exchange on the NMR time scale and that saturation of the binding site occurs at 1:1 ratio Cu:MNK1. Hybrid of MNK1 Containing the MerP Metal Binding Loop (CAAC-MNK1) Because MNK1 and MerP have the same global fold, the metal binding loop of MerP (GMTCAAC) could be readily replaced with that of the MNK1 protein. 1H-15N HSQC spectra of wild-type MNK1 (black) and the chimeric CAACMNK1 (blue) are similar, indicating minimal overall changes in structure due to different residues in the metal binding loop [Fig. 7(A). Similar to the situation with wild-type MNK1, the T18 resonance in the apo CAACMNK1 does not appear in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. However, this resonance does appear in the 1H-15N HSQC

spectrum of MerP, indicating that the motions of the residues in the metal binding loop occur on different time scales in the polypeptides. Resonances from C19, A20, A21, and C22 in CAAC-MNK1 have different chemical shifts, which is not surprising because these residues are in a different environment compared to those in wild-type MNK1. Notably, resonances from G6 and G16 do not appear in the apo CAAC-MNK1 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. G16 is located at the beginning of the metal binding loop, and appears to undergo motions on time scales different from those in the wild-type protein due to changes in sequence; however, G6 is located at the beginning of the first -sheet, which is not in close proximity to the metal binding loop. The resonances from G6 and G16 do appear in the spectrum of Cu(I) bound form of CAAC MNK1 [Fig. 7(B)], which suggests that metal binding stabilizes these residues. The resonance from T18 appears in the spectrum of the Cu(I) bound CAAC MNK1 as found for the Cu(I) bound form of wild-type MNK1. There are no chemical shift changes to F71 upon addition of Cu(I) to CAAC MNK1, in contrast to Cu(I) binding MNK1. These results indicate that changes in the sequence of the metal binding loop induce secondary structural changes not observed in

the wild-type MNK1. This may also suggest that the sequence of the metal binding loop may transduce slight changes in the tertiary fold of the protein that allow for metal specificity in Cu(I) bound MNK1 and Hg(II) bound MerP in its native environment. CONCLUSIONS The first N-terminal MBS in the ATPase associated with Menkes disease (ATP7A) has the characteristic fold common to other MBS found in several metal transport systems.6 Structural changes that accompany copper binding are found in the metal binding loop and surrounding regions. MNK1 binds Cu(I) with two sulfur atoms from C19 and C22 in a linear bicoordinate fashion. The O of Thr 18 and Ser 21, the carbonyl oxygen of C19 and S21, as well as the backbone nitrogen atoms of both Cys 19 and Cys 22 are proximate to the copper ion and act as potential secondary ligands, distorting the SOCuOS angle. These results are supported by previous EXAFS studies of Cu(I)OAtx120 and Cu(I)-MNK125,27 that show a possible role for a third distant ligand in the metal site besides the sulfur atoms from two cysteines. Similar results were also observed for the Ag(I) bound structure of MNK4,7 and the

Cu(I) bound structure of MNK2.28 These distant ligands could stabilize the copper ion during trafficking from HAH1, the human copper chaperone for the Menkes protein.12 Using CD spectroscopy, the relative affinity of MNK1 for different metal ions was determined. The dissociation constant calculated for Cu(I) bound MNK1 is consistent with the association constant reported for Cu(I) binding to the MBS domains of the WND protein.36 Interestingly, the association constant of the copper chaperone protein for the MBS of MNK and WND was also reported to be in this range, indicating that copper trafficking my be under kinetic rather than thermodynamic control. The dissociation constants calculated indicate that MNK1 has a higher affinity for Cu(I) than Hg(II) and Ag(I), which also prefer linear coordination geometry. Interestingly, MNK1 has a substantial affinity for Ni(II) and Cd(II) ions, while both MerP and an 18-residue linear peptide from MerP show much lower affinity for these ions.34 Based on these observations, it is possible to hypothesize that other residues in MNK1 help stabilize Ni(II) and Cd(II), which prefer tetrahedral or octahedral geometries. To understand the structural and dynamic features that determine metal affinity and selectivity, we compared the structures of MerP and MNK1. The overall structures of the apo forms of MNK1 and MerP are very similar, as indicated by the overlayed structures in Figure 8; in contrast, substantial local structural differences are observed in the metal binding loop. For instance, the O from Thr 18 in MNK1 points toward the metal binding loop, while the corresponding Thr O in MerP points away from the metal ion. Resonances from Thr18 and Ser 21 are not observed in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the apo form of MNK1, suggesting that residues in the metal binding loop are affected by motions that are not present in the rest of the polypeptide. Complexities have been observed in the resonance behaviors of all of the APT7A MBS do-

mains.7,8,28 In contrast, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of apo-MerP contain resonances from all of the residues in the metal binding loop. These differences in protein dynamics may account for the specificity of such chemically similar binding loops. These findings were corroborated by the properties of a chimeric protein, CAAC-MNK1, where the metal binding loop of MNK1 (GMTCNSC) was replaced with that of MerP (GMTCAAC). The T18 resonance that is not observable in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of apo MNK1 is not present in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the hybrid CAAC-MNK1. This is interesting, because this Threonine residue, in the same metal binding sequence native to MerP (GMTCAAC), is present in its 1H-15N HSQC spectra. In addition, different dynamics are ob-

served for G6 and G16 in CAAC-MNK1. This suggests that although the XMTCXXC sequence is highly conserved in MBS, the X amino acids in the sequence may play a prominent role in the dynamics of the metal binding loop. Moreover, the residues of the metal binding loop may transduce slight changes in the tertiary fold of the protein that account for metal specificity in Cu(I) bound MNK1 and Hg(II) bound MerP in its native environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression The region of the ATPase gene that was synthesized corresponded to the entire first MBS. It included nucleotides for the terminal aspartate residue and ended at Asp 79. The C-terminal position of the first heavy metal binding motif was based on sequence alignment of MerP16 to ensure proper folding of the protein. Four overlapping single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized. Oligonucleotide 1 contained an EcoRI site and oligonucleotide 4 contained a SalI site for vector insertion. The 5 doublestranded half of the gene was constructed by mixing oligonucleotides 1 and 2 followed by PCR to fill in the missing bases. The same procedure was repeated for the 3 half of the MNK1 gene using oligonucleotides 3 and 4. Because the MNK1 gene contains an intrinsic XhoI site, the 5 double-stranded half of the gene as well as the 3 half were digested with this enzyme and then internally ligated to form the complete gene, including N- and C-terminal restriction sites needed for vector ligation. Because internal ligation using the XhoI sites was not very efficient, the ligated band was extracted from a low melting point agarose gel, and primers were designed for PCR to generate sufficient quantities for vector ligation. The MNK1 gene was digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into the polylinker region of the pMal-c2 vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) digested with the same enzymes. The recombinant pMal-c2 plasmid was transformed into competent DH5 cells purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD). Positive transformants were screened using PCR to regenerate the insert. The DNA sequence was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was then transformed into BL-21 cells from Novagen (Madison, WI) for overexpression in minimal media. Uniformly 15N-labeled MNK1 was expressed in bacteria grown in M9 minimal media (11 g/L Na2HPO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L NaCl, 0.09 g/L thiamine, 0.2 g/L MgSO4, 0.027 g/L CaCl2, 10 g/L glucose, 1 g/L (15NH4)2SO4, pH7.4). Uniformly 13C/15N-labeled MNK1 was expressed in M9 minimal media except 2 g/L of 13C-labeled glucose was used in place of the unlabeled glucose. Specifically, 15Nlabeled cysteine MNK1 was expressed in M9 minimal media containing all unlabeled amino acids except for cysteine, which was 15N labeled. Transfected BL-21 cells were grown for 4 h at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 g/mL of ampicillin. One milliliter of LB growth was added to 50 mL of minimal media, grown overnight at 37°C, and diluted 1:20 in minimal media. When cells reached an optical density of 0.5 at 550 nm, they were induced with 1

mM 1-thio- -D galatopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h. After induction, cells were centrifuged at 3000 g, and stored at 80°C. The MNK1 protein was expressed as a fusion protein. Purification of the maltose binding fusion protein was carried out as described by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) with minor modifications. Briefly, cell pellets collected from 1 L of minimal media growth were resuspended in 20 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (20 mM NaPO4, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 g/mL leupeptin, 0.1 g/mL pepstatin, 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% Azide, pH7.3). After cells were lysed by the French Press at 10,000 psi, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was diluted to 100 mL and loaded onto an amylose resin column. The recombinant fusion protein was eluted with sodium phosphate buffer containing 20 mM maltose, and then concentrated to 1 mg/mL before cleavage of MNK1 from the maltose binding fusion moiety with Factor Xa (10 g per mg of protein at 4°C overnight). The cleavage reaction was terminated by adding 10 mM DTT. The solution was then concentrated for purification on a Sephacryl S-100HR column (90 2.5 cm; Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in sodium acetate buffer (20 mM Sodium Acetate, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5). Each protein purification step was monitored using 15% Tricine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coommassie Brilliant Blue R (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Circular Dichroism Measurements Circular dichroism measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. The samples were contained in a 0.1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette and 10 scans were performed for each measurement. The protein concentration was 0.08 mM in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer with 0.1 mM DTT, pH 6.5. Metal ion titrations were performed by monitoring the changes in ellipticity at 200 nm. The differences in molar ellipticity of both the free and metal bound protein were plotted, and the experimental points were fitted using a nonlinear least squares procedure. The calculation of Kd was performed as previously described.34 Each metal titration was repeated three times to ensure reproducibility with a standard deviation of 0.3 M. Sample Preparation for NMR Experiments Protein concentrations of MNK1 used for NMR spectroscopic experiments were 1­2 mM unless indicated otherwise. The samples contained sodium acetate buffer (20 mM NaAce, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Azide, 0.1 g/mL leupeptin, and 0.1 g/mL pepstatin at pH 6.5) with 90% H2O/10% D2O. Sodium acetate buffer without EDTA was used for protein samples that were titrated with metal. Metal bound samples were prepared by titrating the metal into an already reduced sample until evidence of complete binding was observed in the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum and confirmed in the two-dimensional 1 H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum. A 10-fold excess of DTT is present to keep Cu(I) reduced. Because Cu(II) is a paramagnetic metal with long electron spin relaxation times, if

present in the metal site it would cause substantial line broadening and disappearance of peaks.37 For 199Hg NMR samples, 199HgO was solubilized in concentrated HCl and then diluted in sodium acetate buffer. The protein concentration of MNK1 was 3 mM in a volume of 1.5 mL. After each titration with 199Hg the pH of the protein sample was adjusted to maintain pH 6.5. 199Hg was titrated into the protein solution until no changes in the 1H NMR spectra were observed. After adding 1.5 equivalents of 199Hg to MNK1, the 199Hg spectra were acquired with approximately 200,000 scans. NMR Spectroscopy Experiments All NMR experiments that involved the observation of protein resonances were performed at 25°C on a Bruker DMX 600 NMR spectrometer. The data were processed using XWIN-NMR (Bruker) and analyzed with NMRCOMPASS (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Two-dimensional 1H15 N heteronuclear correlation spectra were obtained using the HSQC pulse sequence.38 Backbone resonance assignments were made using three-dimensional triple resonance experiments, HNCA,39 HNCOCA,29 and CBCACONH.40 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY/HMQC experiments41 were obtained using 50-, 100-, and 250-ms mix times. 15N-edited three-dimensional TOCSY/HMQC experiments were performed with a 70-ms mix time.42 Two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY (100-ms mix time) and 1 H-1H TOCSY (70-ms mix time) experiments were obtained from samples in 100% D2O so that amide protons were completely exchanged and only connectivities among aromatic protons and other nonexchangeable hydrogens were observed. Dihedral angles were calculated from H-H J couplings using a three-dimensional HNHA experiment.43 Hydrogen bond restraints were calculated from a series of two-dimensional WEX-filtered HMQC spectra.44 The one-dimensional 199Hg NMR spectra were obtained at 25°C on a Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer using a 10-mM broad band probe tuned at 89.5 MHz. The spectrum was referenced to neat dimethylmercury at 0 ppm. Residual dipolar couplings were calculated from the difference in JHN splitting measured in isotropic conditions and in the presence of 38 mg/mL of pf1 phage. All of the measurements were carried out at a temperature of 37°C. Because of the remarkable dispersion of the 2D HSQC resonances, residual dipolar couplings were determined from coupled-1H/15N HSQC spectra. Two hundred fifty-six complex point were acquired in t1 (15N) dimension, and 1024 complex point were acquired in the t2(1H) dimension, with a total of 32 scans per increment. Both dimensions were zero-filled to 2048 points in the final data matrix. A square-sine bell window function shifted by 90° was used for both dimensions. Structure Calculations Peak intensities from the N-edited NOESY (100 ms) and the 1H-1H NOESY (100 ms) spectra were used as NOE restraints for structure determination. Peak intensities were converted to distance restraints and classified as strong (1.9 ­2.8 Å), medium (1.9 ­3.3 Å), and weak (1.9 ­5.0
15

Å). Structure calculations were performed using the computer program XPLOR version 3.1,30 with a hybrid distance geometry annealing/simulating protocol. Torsion angle restraints for -helix and -sheet calculated from 3 JHN,HA coupling constants were added when they were consistent with the secondary structure calculations from carbon chemical shift data and short- and medium-range NOEs. Hydrogen bonding restraints were added in the later stages of refinement. Independent calculations were performed for structure determination of apo-MNK1 and Cu(I)-bound MNK1. In the Cu(I)-bound MNK1 structure calculations, the bond length of CuOS was set to 2.16 Å with a force field of 500 kcal mol 1 Å 2. The SOCuOS bond angle was set to 180°, with a force constant of 70 kcal mol 1 rad 2, which is significantly lower than 500 kcal mol 1 Å 2 used for all other bond angles, thus making any observed distortion from linearity significant. A family of 15 independently calculated structures were chosen for final analysis. The criteria for these structures were no NOE violations greater than 0.4 Å, no bond length violations greater than 0.05 Å, and no bond or dihedral angles greater than 5°. The structures generated from the simulated annealing calculations were subject to a further refinement using residual dipolar couplings with the program XPLOR-NIH. The residual dipolar coupling potential were incorporated according to the procedures described by Tjandra.31 Both the values of the axial (Da) and rhombic (R) component of the molecular alignment tensor were calculated using the maximum likelihood method.45 This method allowed us the determination of the values of R and Da with a relatively small set of residual dipolar couplings. The resulting values for Da and R were 13.5 and 0.56, respectively. The most critical stage of the refinement protocol was the introduction of the residual dipolar couplings into the predetermined folding of MNK1. This was accomplished using a step-wise procedure for the force constant that allowed the "gentle" introduction of these additional constraints. The force constant was scaled from a value of 0.001 kcal/mol to a final value of 10 kcal/mol. The initial temperature was 4000 K for scaling kanis from 0.001 to 5 kcal/mol. Subsequently, another simulated annealing calculation was performed using 1000 K as starting temperature to bring kanis from 5 to 10 kcal/mol. The structure was refined with and without RDC restraints in the metal binding loop, and comparatively, these restraints introduced no changes in the structure. The structures generated were selected on the basis of the lowest NOE, dihedral, as well as residual dipolar coupling violations. REFERENCES
