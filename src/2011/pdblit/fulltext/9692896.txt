The dipeptide D-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl p-fluorobenzylamide (D-Leu-Phe-NH-BzlF) inhibits chymotrypsin strongly in a competitive manner with the Ki value of 0.61 µM [Shimohigashi, Y., Maeda, I., Nose, T., Ikesue, K., Sakamoto, H., Ogawa, T., Ide, Y., Kawahara, M., Nezu, T., Terada, Y., Kawano, K. & Ohno, M. (1996) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 2479 2485]. The structure/activity studies have suggested a unique inhibitory conformation, in which the C-terminal benzyl group fits the chymotrypsin S1 site and the hydrophobic core constructed by the side chains of D-Leu-Phe fits the S2 or S1 site. To verify this assumption, the molecular structure of the complex between the dipeptide and -chymotrypsin has been ° determined crystallographically. -Chymotrypsin itself was first crystallized and refined at 1.6-A resolution. The refined structure was virtually identical to the conformation reported and the electron density at the active site was interpreted as a pentapeptide Thr-Pro-Gly-Val-Tyr derived from autolysis of the enzyme (residues 224 228). The chymotrypsin-dipeptide complex was obtained by soaking the crystals of -chymotrypsin in a solution saturated with the dipeptide inhibitor. The crystal structure of the complex ° has been refined at 1.8-A resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 18.1 %. The structure of -chymot° rypsin in the complex agreed fairly well with that of -chymotrypsin per se with a rmsd of 0.13 A for all the CA carbons. Two inhibitor molecules were assigned in an asymmetric unit, i.e. one in the active site and the other at the interface of two symmetry-related enzyme molecules. In both sites dipeptides adopted very similar folded conformations, in which side chains of D-Leu-Phe are spatially proximal. In the active site where the binding of dipeptide was judged to be a direct cause of inhibition, C-terminal pfluorobenzylamide group of the dipeptide, NH-BzlF, was found in the S1 hydrophobic pocket. At the bottom of this pocket, the p-fluorine atom hydrogen bonded with a water molecule, probably to enhance the inhibitory activity. The stereospecific interaction of R and S isomers of the dipeptide with C-terminal NH-C*H(CH3)-C6H5 was well explained by the space available for methyl replacement in the complex. The hydrophobic core constructed by side chains of D-Leu-Phe was found at the broad S2 site. Interestingly, a novel interaction was found between the inhibitor Phe residue and chymotrypsin His57, the ° phenyl of Phe and the imidazole of His being in a - stacking interaction at a distance 3.75 A.

Chymotrypsin is one of the most extensively studied enzymes for elucidation of the structure/activity relationships. A number of crystallographic studies have been reported especially to define structures of the catalytic and specific binding sites (Segal et al., 1971; Fujinaga et al., 1987; Dixon and Matthews, 1989; Stoddard et al., 1990; Dixon et al., 1991 ; Harel et al., 1991; Frigerio et al., 1992; Yennawar et al., 1994), and it was

confirmed that the S1 specificity pocket is close to the catalytic triad of Asp102, His57, and Ser195. When inhibitors or substrates bind to chymotrypsin, the side chain of a hydrophobic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan or leucine occupies the S1 specificity pocket. The hydrophobic amino acid residue is thus designated as the P1 site. The S1 P1 interaction is crucially important to molecular recognition between chymotrypsin and ligands, inhibitors or substrates. The lining up of S versus P subsite interactions (Schechter and Berger, 1967) has been well established for chymotrypsin-inhibitor complexes (Fujinaga et al., 1987; Frigerio et al., 1992). In our effort to design a novel type of enzyme inhibitors, we found the dipeptides having a structure D-Xaa-Phe-NH-CH2C6H5 to be powerful inhibitors of chymotrypsin (Sakamoto et al., 1991, 1993; Maeda et al., 1993, 1996; Shimohigashi et al., 1996). 1H-NMR conformational analyses of these dipeptide benzylamide derivatives indicated the presence of the CH/ interaction between the D-Xaa side chain and the Phe phenyl as one of key structural elements for inhibition. From various types of structure/activity studies, we have suggested that, in the inhib-

itory conformation, the C-terminal phenyl group fits the chymotrypsin S1 site, while the hydrophobic core constructed by DXaa-Phe CH/ interaction fits the chymotrypsin S2 or S site. 1 When a fluorine atom was introduced at the para position of the C-terminal phenyl group, the resulting dipeptide D-Leu-Phe-NHCH2-C6H4(p-F) [D-Leu-Phe-NH-BzlF] exhibited an about sixfold increased inhibitory activity, suggesting an additional interaction in the S1 site. This dipeptide exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity (Ki 0.61 µM) for chymotrypsin among a series of dipeptide having a D-Xaa-Phe backbone structure and is one of the most potent chymotrypsin inhibitors to date. Furthermore, the C-terminal phenyl group was found to interact stereospecifically with chymotrypsin. The S-isomer of D-Leu-Phe-NHC*H(CH3)-C6H5 was about 20-fold less active than the parent benzyl amide, while the R-isomer was almost equally potent with the benzyl amide. Peptidie inhibitors whose C-terminal amide-phenyl group interacts with the chymotrypsin S1 site do not appear to have been investigated. In addition, the size of the side-chain side-chain hydrophobic core appears to be considerably larger at the P2 or P site than that of an ordinary inhibitor subsite. Since such an 1 interaction between the dipeptide and chymotrypsin is so unusual, we decided to clarify the crystallographic structure of the inhibitor-enzyme complex. In the present study, we analyzed a three-dimensional crystal structure of the complex of D-LeuPhe-NH-BzlF with chymotrypsin to clarify the actual structure of the dipeptide inhibitor in the enzyme.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Crystallization, data collection and data processing. Crystals of -chymotrypsin was obtained from A-chymotrypsin (Sigma, C-4129) according to the procedure reported by Stoddard et al. (1990). -Chymotrypsin crystals were in space group ° ° P42212 with unit cell dimensions of a b 69.52 A, c 97.81 A. Intensity data were collected at 292 K, using a Rigaku R-AXIS IIc with a collimator of 0.5 mm and were processed with the program PROCESS (Rigaku). A Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode X-ray generator was operated at 50 kV and 100 mA (focus size: ° 0.3 mm) to obtain CuKA radiation ( 1.5418 A) which was monochromatized with double focusing mirrors (Molecular Structure Co.). Two sets of 90 diffraction images from different crystal orientations were measured from one crystal (0.4 0.4 0.25 mm3) with 1.0° oscillation and a crystal detector distance of 62 mm. On those 180 frames, 31740 unique reflections with ° I I were recorded up to 1.6-A resolution, which gave a completeness of 97.8% and a Rmerge of 5.5%. The ratio of scale factors between the first and the last frames was 0.63. The chymotrypsin-inhibitor complex was prepared by soaking the selected native -chymotrypsin crystals for one month at 293 K in a solution of 100 mM Hepes pH 7.5 saturated with inhibitor and 65% saturated with ammonium sulfate. Intensity data were measured from one crystal (0.4 0.25 0.15 mm3) as described above except for the crystal detector distance of 80 mm and the total rotation ranges of 80° and 60°. On the 140 frames measured, 22647 unique reflections with I I were ° recorded up to 1.8-A resolution, which gave a completeness of 98.1% and a Rmerge of 5.9%. Data collection and processing statistics are listed in Table 1. The ratio of scale factors between the first and the last frames was 0.70. Structure refinement. All the calculations for refinement were done with the X-PLOR program (Brünger, 1992) running on a Silicon Graphics workstation Indigo2. Electron density maps with coefficients (2Fo Fc) and (F o Fc) were examined after every refinement calculation, and manual rebuildings of

atomic models were then performed on a three-dimensional graphics program QUANTA 4.1 (Molecular Simulation Inc.). A summary of the final refinement statistics is given in Table 2. The starting model for refinement of -chymotrypsin was the ° structure refined to a R factor of 17.3% at 1.6-A resolution (1GCT: Dixon and Matthews, 1989), from which all the solvent molecules and the bound peptide were excluded. A set of parameters provided in the X-PLOR program (Engh and Huber, 1991) was used through all the molecular force-field calculation. Cycles of positional and individual B factor refinements with the conjugate gradient method were carried out, giving an R factor ° of 25.2% in the resolution range 10.0 1.8 A. Solvent molecules were then added into all the peaks in Fo Fc maps (greater than 4), except for ones where no hydrogen bondings were made either with the protein or with other solvents.

RESULTS Quality of refinements. The structure of both -chymotrypsin and the enzyme-inhibitor complex have no geometrical defects which has led to small rmsds from the ideal values for bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles (Table 2). A Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan and Ramachandran, 1965) of each refined structure indicated that all the residues except for Gly emerge in energetically favored regions (data not shown). On the other hand, Luzzati plots (Luzzati, 1952) indicated that the ° mean error in atomic position is approximately 0.20 A for both either -chymotrypsin and the complex (data not shown). The average B values of the protein molecule in -chymotrypsin are ° ° 16.5 A2 for main-chain atoms and 17.5 A2 for side-chain atoms. Similarly, in the protein of the complex structure, the main-chain ° component shows an average temperature factor of 16.3 A2, ° 2. while average side-chain atom temperature factors are 17.3 A Structure of -chymotrypsin. The structure of the -chymotrypsin is virtually identical to that of 1GCT with an rmsd of ° 0.12 A for all the CA atoms. Besides the N- and C-terminal regions, the difference between our structure and the one at cryogenic temperature (8GCH: Harel et al., 1991) can be seen only at a loop (residues 202 206), as pointed out by Harel et al. (1991) from the comparison between 8GCH and 1GCT (the CA ° position of residue 203 differs by 1.4 A). The most plausible explanation for electron density at the active site is a pentapeptide, Thr-Pro-Gly-Val-Tyr, which corresponds to residues 224 228 derived from autolysis of the enzyme. The continuous electron density between the side chain of Ser195 and the P1 residue (Tyr) of the bound peptide suggests that -chymotrypsin is an acyl-enzyme in which the peptide is covalently linked to the catalytic residue (Dixon and Matthews, 1989; Harel et al., 1991; Dixon et al., 1991; Yennawar et al., 1994).

for a bound peptide was fitted into electron density on Fo Fc maps after most solvent molecules were assigned. Occupancies for side-chain atoms in uncertain regions with diffuse density (shown in Table 3) were set to zero in order to exclude their contributions to electron density calculations. The final model of -chymotrypsin, including 127 water molecules, one sulfate molecule and the bound peptide molecule, gives a crystallographic R factor of 19.1 % for all the reflections with I I in ° the range of resolution 5.0 1.6 A. The model includes alternative positions for the side chains of Val53 and Gln239 and the whole molecule of the bound peptide. A summary of the illdefined regions is given in Table 3. Refinement of the chymotrypsin-inhibitor complex was started from our refined structure of -chymotrypsin excluding all the solvent molecules and the bound peptide, giving a R ° factor of 27.0% in the resolution range 10.0 1.8 A. The same scheme as described for the -chymotrypsin crystal was also employed in the course of this refinement. The final model of the enzyme including two inhibitor molecules, one sulfate ion, and

Enzyme enzyme

The bound peptide seems to have two distinct conformations (Fig. 1). Table 4 shows a list of hydrogen bondings found at the active site. The first conformer is rather extended and lies on the binding cavity of the enzyme where specific and direct interactions occur through the site P1 P5 (Fig. 2 a). These interactions include hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions of the Tyr side chain in the S1 specificity pocket as well as backbone hydrogen bonds between the pentapeptide and the enzyme in the S3 subsite. The hydrogen-bonding pattern observed in the first conformer is identical with that found in 1GCT. This feature of interactions (Dixon and Matthews, 1989) is commonly seen not only in other crystal structures of chymotrypsin but also in other mammalian serine protease structures complexed with peptides or inhibitor proteins (Lee et al., 1993; Takahashi et al., 1989; Stubbs et al., 1992; Bone et al., 1991). The phenolic oxygen of P1 Tyr interacts by hydrogen bond with Wat596 at the bottom of the S1 pocket. The carbonyl oxygen of the P1 residue partially occupies the oxyanion hole with a hydrogen bond to the amide ° nitrogen of Gly193, but is 3.46 A away from the amide nitrogen of Ser195. A water molecule located close to the carbonyl car° bon of P1 residue (2.60 A) accepts a hydrogen bond from NE2 of His57. The angle  in the P2 residue of the bound peptide is within the allowed range for Pro ( 72.49°), which seems to be essential to maintain interactions at both P1 and P3 simultaneously. All the chymotrypsin structures so far reported have similar torsion angles around this bond, no matter what kind of amino acid is in this position. It should be noted that this feature is also common in substrate and/or peptide inhibitor recognition of all the mammalian serine proteases (Table 5).

The second conformer makes the same interactions at P1 and P2 sites with the enzyme as the first conformer does, whereas the P3-P4 residues are on the edge of the cavity (Fig. 2 b). The entire P5 residue of the second conformer is disordered in the final electron density map probably due to lack of interaction with the enzyme. A similar conformation of the bound peptide has been also found in 1GMC (Yennawar et al., 1994). Structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex agrees fairly well with that of the -chymotrypsin structure described above with an rmsd of ° 0.13 A for all the CA atoms of the protein. Two inhibitor molecules were found in an asymmetric unit : one is accommodated in the active site (site I, see Fig. 3) while the other is in a cleft at the interface of two symmetry-related enzyme molecules (site II, see Fig. 4) as if the inhibitor acted as a wedge. Lists of hydrogen bondings between the inhibitors and the enzyme are summarized in Tables 6 and 7. Although each inhibitor molecule is in a slightly different conformation, they do have a common structural features, i.e. N-terminal D-Leu and L-Phe moieties of the inhibitor molecules fold together to form a hydrophobic core, while the C-terminal p-fluorobenzylamide moiety, NH-BzlF, directs the opposite side to the phenyl ring of the L-Phe moiety. From comparison of the structures of -chymotrypsin in the complexes with the dipeptide inhibitor and the pentapeptide, it was found that most of amino acid residues, including buried water molecules (Wat539, 590, 595 and 596), are substantially in an identical conformation in both structures. Thus, the network of hydrogen bondings is also highly conserved, except for those in which the bound peptide or inhibitor participates

(b) The same drawing as in (a) but for the folded conformation of the peptide (form II). Symmetry-related molecules are drawn by faint line.

(Fig. 4 a). The NH-BzlF moiety of the site I molecule is located at the S1 subsite. Its aromatic ring is entirely accommodated in the hydrophobic specificity pocket so that the fluorine atom at ° the bottom of this pocket is within a distance (3.10 A) to make hydrogen bonding with Wat596. This interaction is geometrically similar to the one between the phenolic oxygen of P1 Tyr and Wat596 found in -chymotrypsin. The amide nitrogen of Cterminal NH-BzlF, which is located at a position identical to that of the P1 residue (Tyr) of the bound peptide in the -chymotryp° sin, is within hydrogen bonding distance (3.09 A) of the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ser214. Although the bound inhibitor does not interact with the amide nitrogen of either Ser195 or that of Gly193, a water molecule occupies the oxyanion hole seemingly to mimic the P1 carbonyl oxygen of the acyl-enzyme. Interestingly, in this complex structure, the phenyl ring of the inhibitor L-Phe makes a stacking interaction with the imidaz-

ole ring of His57, one of the catalytic residues of the enzyme. ° The distance is 3.75 A from the CG of His57 to the phenyl ring ° and 3.75 A from the CD1 of L-Phe to the imidazole ring. The methyl (CD1) of Ile99 forms a so-called CH/ interaction ° (3.72 A) with the indole ring of Trp215 in this complex structure, whereas the -methyl group turns away from the indole ring in -chymotrypsin. The most striking feature at the P2 site is the formation of a unique hydrophobic pocket by side chains of His57, Ile99, and Trp215 together with D-Leu of the inhibitor, which accommodates the phenyl ring of the P2 residue. The amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor DLeu interact with the backbone carbonyl and amide of Gly216 ° ° (2.54 A and 2.76 A, respectively), as usually seen in other mammalian serine protease/inhibitor complexes (Lee et al., 1993; Takahashi et al., 1989; Stubbs et al., 1992; Bone et al., 1991). This indicates D-Leu to be the P3 residue of the dipeptide inhibitor.

The angle  in the P2 residue of the inhibitor ( 54.42°) is also close to those found in other serine protease/inhibitor complexes (Table 5). The other inhibitor molecule fits right at the cleft between two symmetry-related enzyme molecules (site II); it interacts

with both enzymes and neighboring water molecules by means of hydrogen bondings as well as by hydrophobic contacts. Only one of these hydrogen bondings is a direct interaction with the enzyme, whereas the remainder are water-mediated ones (Fig. 4, Table 7). The inhibitor molecule in site II showed a smaller

DISCUSSION The two forms of chymotrypsin, A and , are chemically identical and their crystal structures are very similar. They differ

in their crystallization properties. The refined structure of -chymotrypsin in the present study was found to be substantially identical to the conformation clarified previously (Dixon and Matthews, 1989). Prepared -chymotrypsin crystals contained a pentapeptide Thr-Pro-Gly-Val-Tyr from autolysis of the enzyme (residues 224 228) at the active site as reported (Dixon and Matthews, 1989). Although the peptide adopted two different

conformations, both conformers held the same interactions at P1 and P2 sites, acylating the enzyme. Meanwhile, it has been reported that some inhibitors can react with previously grown crystals of -chymotrypsin to take the place of such a peptide (Segal et al., 1971; Stoddard et al., 1990). When the dipeptide inhibitor D-Leu-Phe-NH-BzlF, was incubated with -chymotrypsin crystals in this study, a chymotrypsin-inhibitor complex was produced and we were able to refine the structure crystallographically. As expected from various structure/activity studies, the dipeptide inhibitor D-Leu-Phe-NH-BzlF was found in the active center of chymotrypsin (Fig. 3 b) in the crystals of the chymotrypsin-inhibitor complex. This indicates that the dipeptide indeed reacted with -chymotrypsin crystals, displacing the pentapeptide at the active site. In addition, another inhibitor molecule was found at the interface (site II) of two symmetry-related enzyme molecules (Fig. 4 b), although this molecule would not be able to inhibit chymotrypsin. In the molecular structure of D-Leu-Phe-NH-BzlF there are three candidates that can act as the P1 site, namely the Leu isobutyl, the Phe phenyl, and the C-terminal p-fluorobenzyl. In the actual crystal structure of the chymotrypsin-inhibitor complex, the C-terminal NH-BzlF moiety was found to penetrate into the S1 specificity pocket. Since the derivative lacking this p-fluorobenzyl group was completely unable to inhibit the enzyme (Shimohigashi et al., 1996), the P1 S1 interaction is the most important determinant in inhibition of chymotrypsin by the dipeptides. At the bottom of the S1 specificity pocket, the fluorine atom attached to the para position of the inhibitor C-terminal benzyl

was in a hydrogen bonding with a water molecule 596. D-LeuPhe-NH-BzlF (Ki 0.61 µM) was six times more potent at inhibiting chymotrypsin than D-Leu-Phe-NH-CH 2-C6H5 which lacks fluorine. The activity enhancement caused by introduction of fluorine is probably due to the hydrogen bonding with the water, which makes further hydrogen bondings with the hydroxyl groups of enzyme Ser189 and Ser217. Such a network of hydrogen bondings would greatly stabilize the interaction between the enzyme and inhibitor. The Tyr phenolic group of the pentapeptide is also in hydrogen bonding at the back of the S1 pocket. The effect of this hydrogen bonding is easily appreciable from the experimental results obtained for the hydrolysis of Ac-L-Phe-OEt and Ac-LTyr-OEt (Berezin et al., 1971). When their chymotrypsin hydrolyses were compared, Ac-L-Tyr-OEt was found to be a much better substrate than Ac-L-Phe-OEt: i.e. 2.8 times larger kcat and 2.8 times smaller Km values for Ac-L-Tyr-OEt than for Ac-LPhe-OEt. This is apparently due to the hydrogen bonding of the Tyr phenol at the S1 pocket. For peptidie substrates or inhibitors, the P1 S1 interaction in chymotrypsin is highly stereospecific. The P1 amino acid residue should be in the L-configuration for interaction with the S1 specificity pocket. Although D-Leu-Phe-NH-BzlF per se has no chirality at the C-terminal NH-BzlF moiety, the methylene carbon atom is a pro-chiral center and the two H atoms on the carbon are therefore said to be pro-chiral. When one of these H atoms was replaced by a methyl group, the resulting stereoisomers of D-Leu-Phe-NH-C*H(CH3)-C6H5 exhibited quite dif-

ferent inhibitory potency. The R-isomer was almost equally potent with the benzylamide, indicating that replacement of the pro-R H (H R) with CH3 did not affect in the least the interaction of the inhibitor C-terminal NH-C*H(CH3)-C6H5 moiety with the

S1 specificity pocket. The S-isomer was about 20-fold less active than the parent benzylamide. These results are coincide well with the three-dimensional structural feature at the S1 specificity pocket with the inhibitor C-terminal moiety. The pro-S H atom

(HS) was found to be spatially rather tight in the pocket, while HR is directed towards a small open space. This is very clear when the dipeptide inhibitor and the pentapeptide Thr-Pro-GlyVal-Tyr were superimposed at the active site of -chymotrypsin (Fig. 5). As mentioned above, the amide nitrogen of the inhibitor C-terminal NH-BzlF is located at the position identical to that of the P1 residue (Tyr) of the bound peptide and is within hydrogenbonding distance of Ser214 C O. It should be noted that HR locates at almost the same position as the Tyr CA atom, which holds three substituents (H, NH, and CO) there. This means that HR can be easily displaced by the methyl group. Another important structural feature elucidated by the crystallographic analysis of chymotrypsin-inhibitor complex is that the inhibitor adopts a folded conformation at the N-terminal dipeptide moiety. This folded conformation is probably caused by the CH/ interaction between the D-Leu isobutyl hydrogen atoms and the phenyl ring of L-Phe. This feature is in good agreement with that suggested from the 1H-NMR experiments on this series of inhibitors (Maeda et al., 1995; Shimohigashi et al., 1996). When the chemical shifts of the Leu side-chain protons of D-Leu-Phe-NH-CH2-C 6H5 were compared to those of DLeu-Ala-NH-CH2-C6H5 which lacks the Phe phenyl group, considerably larger upfield shifts were observed for D-Leu CH2 (0.372 ppm), CH (0.572 ppm), and CH3 (0.212 ppm). These upfield shifts are attributed to the shielding effect from the Phe phenyl group and the results implied that the Phe phenyl group is close to the the D-Leu isobutyl. Indeed CH, which exhibited the most pronounced upfield shift, was found to be closest to ° the Phe phenyl (3.3 4.7 A from the C atoms of the benzene ring) in the chymotrypsin-inhibitor complex. It should be noted that this folded conformation is substantiated by the D-L configurational sequence (Maeda et al., 1995; Shimohigashi et al., 1996). L-Leu-L-Phe-NHBzl was completely inactive at inhibiting chymotrypsin and its NMR spectrum showed no upfield shifts of the L-Leu isobutyl. The most intriguing structural feature clarified in the present study is that, at the opposite side of the D-Leu-isobutyl, the Phe

phenyl is in a stacking interaction with the chymotrypsin His57 imidazole group. This - stacking certainly stabilizes the chymotrypsin inhibitor interaction, perhaps resulting in a reinforcement of inhibition. Among all the chymotrypsin-inhibitor complexes so far examined, none of the side chains at the P2 position shows such a specific interaction with the enzyme (Dixon et al., 1991; Harel et al., 1991; Frigerio et al., 1992; Fujinaga et al., 1987). The interaction between side chains of His and Phe have been found in a number of proteins and the stacked geometry was found to be strongly favored in almost all the cases (Singh and Thornton, 1990; Harata et al., 1993; Mitchell et al., 1994; Ma and Dougherty, 1997). Usually the - stacking interaction between phenylalanine rings is rarely observed in proteins (Singh and Thornton, 1985; Hunter et al., 1991; Chipot et al., 1996). For -systems which are polarized by heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, stacked interactions appear to be feasible. The His/Phe interaction has been characterized as one of sp2-hybridized nitrogen / aromatic interactions or the cation- interactions, and is substantiated by the imidazole group in the His side chain (Ma and Dougherty, 1997). The stacked His/Phe interaction must be predominant also between the chymotrypsin His57 and the dipeptide Phe. Two aromatic rings of the dipeptide are in critical interactions with chymotrypsin, i.e. the Phe phenyl group in the - stacking interaction and the C-terminal benzyl group in the P1 S1 hydrophobic interaction. This would limit the distance between the Phe phenyl and the C-terminal benzyl groups to a certain length. It was found that the inhibitory potencies of DLeu-Phe-NH-C6H5 (n 0) and D-Leu-Phe-NH-CH2-CH2-C6H5 (n 2) decrease drastically as compared with that of D-LeuPhe-NH-CH2-C 6H5 (n 1) (Shimohigashi et al., 1996). There is indeed an optimal distance between these phenyl groups for specific interaction in the chymotrypsin active center. It was found that the P3 moiety of the inhibitor, namely the D-Leu residue, is associated with the formation of the S2 pocket which accepts the Phe phenyl. Since a dipeptide unit D-Leu-Phe constructs the hydrophobic core in a folded conformation, this

unit itself can be denoted as the P2 site and thus the enzyme can be said to have a large cavity at the S2 pocket. A similar structural feature has also been observed in the crystal structure of the complex between human A-thrombin and the inhibitor DPhe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (Bode et al., 1989). It was found that the side chain of the P2 residue Pro is encapsulated in a hydrophobic cage formed by the side chains of Trp215, Leu99, His57, Tyr60A, and Trp60A (the numbering is based on topological equivalence with chymotrypsinogen) and that the D-Phe phenyl fills the residual part of the hydrophobic cavity to close this cage. Apparently, the conformation of this peptide is due to the D-configuration of phenylalanine, the role of which is very similar to that of D-Leu in D-Leu-Phe-NH-Bzl in the D-L configurational sequence (see above). It should be noted that the formation of a side-chain side-chain hydrophobic core in D-Xaa-Phe and D-Phe-Xaa dipeptides is essential for enzyme inhibition (Maeda et al., 1995; Shimohigashi et al., 1996). The inhibitor molecule was also found at the cleft between two chymotrypsin molecules (site II). Based on the symmetry/ asymmetry criterion, Meyer et al. (1995) have recently surveyed the receptor ligand interactions to explore unexpected binding, whereby protein and ligands appear not to behave as expected. Although the interaction of the asymmetric dipeptide inhibitor with two symmetry-related enzyme molecules at site II was quite unexpected, it is mediated mainly through solvent water molecules and thus it is unlikely that this second binding site is also provided in solution. The present study to analyze the inhibitory conformation of a dipeptide clearly indicates that the dipeptide D-Leu-Phe-NHBzlF occupies very efficiently the hydrophobic cavity of chymotrypsin active center. All the interactions between the dipeptide and the enzyme are of a hydrophobic nature. The only exception is a hydrogen bonding of the fluorine atom at the back of the S1 pocket, which resulted in a considerable activity enhancement. Thus, the dipeptide is novel in that it has no groups to react directly with the chymotrypsin active site, and Ser195 in a catalytic triad of chymotrypsin is free from the interaction. It is of interest to examine the reactivity of this Ser195 when His57 is in - stacking interaction with the inhibitor Phe phenyl. The original idea for designing this dipeptide was to stabilize or fix the bioactive conformation to reinforce the ligand acceptor interaction. The present data strongly suggest that the CH/ interaction between side chains is a structural core for inhibition of serine proteinases. A study to design inhibitors having additional structural elements is in progress in our laboratory.
