The MPT64 protein and its homologs form a highly conserved family of secreted proteins with unknown function that are found within the pathogenic Mycobacteria genus. The founding member of this family from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MPT64 or protein Rv1980c) is expressed only when Mycobacteria cells are actively dividing. By virtue of this relatively unique expression profile, Rv1980c is currently under phase III clinical trials to evaluate its potential to replace tuberculin, or purified protein derivative, as the rapid diagnostic of choice for detection of active tuberculosis infection. We describe here the NMR solution structure of Rv1980c. This structure reveals a previously undescribed fold that is based upon a variation of a -grasp motif most commonly found in protein­protein interaction domains. Examination of this structure in conjunction with multiple sequence alignments of MPT64 homologs identifies a candidate ligand-binding site, which may help guide future studies of Rv1980c function. The work presented here also suggests structure-based approaches for increasing the antigenic potency of a Rv1980c-based diagnostic.

Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and is the leading single-agent infectious disease killer in the world, accounting for nearly three million deaths each year.1 Current estimates suggest that as many as one-third of the world's population are latently infected with Mtb,1 and the growing number of immuno-compromised individuals worldwide is greatly increasing the rate of progression from latent TB to active, infectious TB. Early diagnosis of persons with actively infectious TB is essential to controlling the spread of this

disease, and to curtailing the ever-increasing incidence of drug-resistant Mtb strains by allowing physicians to target chemoprophylaxis selectively to those individuals with actively infectious TB.1 Currently, there are few methods available to accurately diagnose active TB infection, and those that do exist are generally cost-prohibitive to the developing areas of the globe which desperately need them most.1 Initial clinical trials of a diagnostic called the Patch Test for Active Tuberculosis (PTAT) suggest that this technology might provide a sensitive and specific method for identifying persons with active TB at substantially reduced costs.2, 3 The active component of the PTAT is a single, secreted Mtb protein known as antigen MPT64 or Rv1980c that is administered from an adhesive patch. We recently observed that structural genes for at least one Rv1980c-like protein are found in all species of Mycobacteria most closely related to Mtb (with the important exception of most BCG vaccine strains), and that reasonably well conserved Rv1980c-like

376 proteins of roughly 40% sequence identity exist in all Mycobacteria species for which genomic sequences are available. However, Rv1980c and its homologs share no detectable sequence homology to other proteins of known structure or function, as determined by equilibrium positionspecific iterated BLAST searches.4 This lack of sequence similarity makes assigning potential physiological roles for the Rv1980c family very difficult, especially since direct genetic analysis of bacterial strains specifically deficient in Rv1980c is complicated by mitigating factors such as the potential for functional complementation and lack of an appropriate assay for its activity in animal infection models. Nonetheless, several lines of evidence suggest that Rv1980c and its homologs may serve a role in the complex pathogenesis of Mycobacteria. First, Rv1980c is only expressed and secreted from actively growing cells.5 Second, the gene encoding Rv1980c is part of the 11 gene RD2 region that is deleted from nearly all BCG strains.6 Loss of this region from BCG progenitor strains has been correlated with a drop in virulence in animal infection models and reduced vaccine lesions in infected humans,6 and of the genes present in RD2, only Rv1980c and the PE-PGRS family member Rv1983 cannot be assigned a function based on sequence similarity. Finally, both of these proteins contain signal peptides and are secreted from the cell, suggesting that they are unlikely to be involved in cell homeostasis, and may instead function as Mycobacteriaspecific virulence factors. Rv1980c adopts a novel fold containing a -grasp motif To provide unique and complementary insights into the potential functions of this protein family, we used heteronuclear NMR techniques to determine the solution structure of Rv1980c. A representation of the average Rv1980c structure along with overlaid stereo images of the 24 lowest energy backbone traces of Rv1980c are shown in Figure 1(a) and (b), respectively. In addition, structural statistics are summarized in Table 1. Details of NMR data collection and protein backbone and side-chain resonance assignments have been reported separately.7 Comparison of the averaged Rv1980c structure with structures found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using DALI8 revealed no statistically significant similarities, and this suggests that Rv1980c defines a novel protein fold. Analysis of the ensemble of Rv1980c solution structures shown in Figure 1(b) suggests a pseudo-two-domain architecture, where the N-terminal region accounts for roughly two-thirds of the secondary structure elements in the protein. This region assumes a grasp-like motif, in which a long -helix (residues 42­60) packs at an unusually shallow angle against a plane formed from a seven-strand mixed -sheet network. A single disulfide bond between C7 and C19 appears to help stabilize a single turn of an -

helix near the Rv1980c N terminus, although this feature does not appear to contribute significantly to the orientation or stability of the -grasp motif. In contrast, the C-terminal region of Rv1980c shares few structural features with currently described protein motifs. Because this region also appears to have more ensemble structural variation in solution and consequently less observable nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) constraints, structural refinement using residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) facilitated the determination of a more well defined ensemble in this region (Figure 2). Although approximately one-half of its constituent residues are found in loop/coil structures, the most prominent feature in the C-terminal region is a four-turn -helix (residues 137­147) extending orthogonally behind the plane of the -grasp strands (Figure 1(a)). One peculiar feature of the Rv1980c structure is found at the interface between the -grasp motif and the C-terminal region. Close investigation of this region reveals unfavorable hydrogen bonding geometry and distances between potential 6 and 8 donor/acceptor pairs. A more likely stabilizing factor between the N and C-terminal regions of Rv1980c involves packing interactions between the side-chains of Y107-Q166 and K108-F168-F177W126, which appear to form a network of hydrophobic interactions that anchor the two domains together. Strong sequence conservation between orthologous Rv1980c family proteins at these latter residue positions suggests that this hydrophobic packing arrangement is a general feature of this fold (Figure 3(a)). Identification of a putative protein­protein interaction surface on Rv1980c Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that Rv1980c and its orthologs may serve a role in the complex pathogenesis of Mycobacteria. Given that prototypic bacterial -grasp proteins such as the superantigens,9 chemotaxis inhibitory protein10 and secreted extracellular adhesin Eap from Staphylococcus aureus11 each form protein­protein interactions, it seems likely that the Rv1980c protein, which contains a similar motif, may likewise form specific protein­protein interactions important to Mycobacterial virulence. To examine the possibility for a protein binding site in Rv1980c more closely, we searched for regions on the protein surface with high sequence conservation across known Rv1980c family members (Figure 3(b)). Interestingly, a prominent region of absolute sequence identity was found in a moderately acidic cleft of approximate dimensions 24 Å long and 12 Å deep that lies near the surface interface of the -grasp and Cterminal domains. In addition, a negatively charged cavity with dimensions similar to a tyrosine sidechain was observed in the middle region of this cleft (arrow in Figure 3(c)). The absolutely conserved residues in the vicinity of this cleft, which are depicted using purple in Figure 3(a) and (b), include D40, Y47, T87, K108,

NOE restraints were generated from inter-proton distances derived from two 13C-edited NOESY spectra (carrier set on either the aliphatic or aromatic region) and an 15N-edited NOESY spectrum. Dihedral angle constraints were derived from an analysis of 1HN, 15NH, 1H, 13  13  C , C , and 13CO chemical shifts using the TALOS method.18 Structures were calculated using CNS 1.119 and final structures were refined with residual dipolar coupling (RDC) constraints (see Figure 2). The quality of the structures was assessed using the PROCHECK-NMR package.20, 21 A Ramachandran plot of the final 24 structures showed 82.1%, 13.4%, 3.1% and 1.4% of residues in the most favored, allowed, additional allowed and disallowed regions, respectively.

tions, it is worth noting that the dimensions of the acidic cleft in Rv1980c suggest that an -helix from a cognate binding partner could be accommodated in this region. Structural insights into increasing diagnostic potency of Rv1980c The solution structure presented here may also facilitate ongoing efforts to improve the antigenic potency of the recombinant Rv1980c incorporated as the PTAT active ingredient.

F110, T121, L125, and F177, while additional proximal highly conserved (cyan in Figure 3(a) and (b)) residues include P119, D123, P132, P138, F168, and F179. Interestingly, the four surface exposed conserved phenylalanine residues are found in this region (F110, F168, F177, and F179), and this is consistent with earlier observations of Ma, Nussinov and co-workers that conservation of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and methionine residues on protein surfaces occurs selectively in regions of protein­protein interactions.12 Moreover, the four aspartic acid and threonine residues in this conserved region (D39, T87, T121, and D123) are among the seven residues reported by Fernandez & Scheraga to have the highest propensity to be at a protein­protein interface, since these residues preferentially engage in destabilizing hydrated hydrogen bonds, and also have only one torsional degree of freedom in the side-chain.13 An Rv1980c surface structural representation depicting the correlation of conserved residues with those having a strong tendency to be involved in protein­protein interaction surfaces is presented in Supplementary Data, Figure 1. Given that protein interaction surfaces are often characterized by localized "hot spots" on an interaction surface, rather than contacts by all residues on the surface,13 the greater than 50% correlation of protein­protein interaction surface propensity to homologous conservation of these residues seems quite significant. Although there is no known binding partner for Rv1980c or any of its orthologs, in conjunction with the above observa-

380 mechanism of action of the PTAT is currently unknown, it appears to involve infiltration of effector T-cells that recognize specific regions of MPT64 and release pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction similar to that seen for the existing tuberculin test. Previous studies have shown that the entire delayed-type hypersensitivity-inducing activity of Rv1980c lies within a single, T-cell reactive epitope (denoted CE15) between residues G173 and A187 (Supplementary Data, Figure 2) that is reactive as a free peptide.14 One potential approach to increasing the antigenic potency of Rv1980c is to employ an epitope tagging strategy15 and incorporate additional single or multiple copies of this immunogenic Rv1980c epitope into regions of the protein that are not expected to disrupt folding of Rv1980c to its native structure. Such an Rv1980c variant would be expected to increase the immunogenicity of the protein molecule, which would decrease the required Rv1980c dose and manufacturing costs for the PTAT. Since 11 of the CE15 residues are solvent exposed, epitope insertion does not appear likely to adversely affect the solubility of engineered Rv1980c variants. In addition, examination of the Rv1980c solution structure reveals 15 internal loop regions within the protein (Figure 1), which are promising candidates for inserting additional CE15 copies, since such regions are known to be more amenable to insertional mutagenesis.15 Given the concentration of TB in the developing world,6 these engineered improvements in Rv1980c could have a profound impact on the availability of the PTAT in these countries where the PTAT diagnostic is needed most. Protein Data Bank accession codes The coordinates for Rv1980c have been deposited under accession code 2HHI.
