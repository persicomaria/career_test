Rho-kinase is a main player in the regulation of cytoskeletal events and a promising drug target in the treatment of both vascular and neurological disorders. Here we report the crystal structure of the Rho-kinase catalytic domain in complex with the specific inhibitor Y-27632. Comparison with the structure of PKA bound to this inhibitor revealed a potential induced-fit binding mode that can be accommodated by the phosphate binding loop. This binding mode resembles to that observed in the Rho-kinase-fasudil complex. A structural database search indicated that a pocket underneath the phosphate-binding loop is present that favors binding to a small aromatic ring. Introduction of such a ring group might spawn a new modification scheme of pre-existing protein kinase inhibitors for improved binding capability. Key words: drug design, protein flexibility, protein kinase, specificity. Rho-kinase (ROKa, Rho-associated kinase or p160ROCK) (1­4) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is one of the best characterized targets of the activated RhoA molecule. Rho-kinase has an isozyme (ROKb/ROCK I) that exhibits 92% sequence identity in the catalytic domain and belongs to the AGC family of eukaryotic protein kinases whose members include PKA and PKC. These kinases contain a protein kinase domain that requires a C-terminal extension outside the catalytic core domain for catalytic activity that contains the so-called `hydrophobic motif' of six residues, FXXF[T/S][F/Y] (where X stands for any amino acid residue) (5­7). Unlike the AGC kinases, Rho-kinase possesses not only an important C-terminal extension, but a novel N-terminal extension required for catalytic activity, features apparent when initially identified as an activated RhoA target (8). Aberration of the Rho-kinase pathway involved in actomyosin contraction processes can have serious pathophysiological consequences. Abnormal contraction of vascular smooth muscle causes diseases such as hypertension and vasospasm of the coronary and cerebral arteries (9). This has been observed in various neurological disorders in the central nervous system (10). Several specific inhibitors of Rho-kinase have been developed for treating these diseases and for analyzing cellular events. The therapeutic potential of Rho-kinase inhibitors is reflected in their ability to induce significant vasodilatory effects (11). Currently, two major series of Rho-kinase inhibitors are widely used: isoquinoline derivatives and 4-aminopyridine derivatives. One of the most prominent isoquinoline derivatives is fasudil (HA-1077), and is currently used to clinically treat cerebral vasospasm (12). The 4-aminopyridine derivative Y-27632 (13) displayed an encouraging selectivity profile

toward Rho-kinase in an experiment that compared its binding to 25 protein kinases (14). Y-27632 is representative of the series that is most widely utilized in biological and pharmacological experiments (10). Previously, we determined the Rho-kinase-fasudil complex structure and revealed an induced-fit conformational change in the drug binding site (15). This observation prompted us to examine the Rho-kinase structure bound to the specific inhibitor Y-27632. Here, we report the crystal structure of the kinase domain of Rho-kinase in complex with the specific inhibitor Y-27632. A 400-residue Rho-kinase fragment (residues 18­417) was expressed in Sf9 insect cells with a hexa-histidine tag using the Bac-to-Bac recombinant baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies) and the protein was purified as described previously (15). 5.3 mg of purified protein was obtained from 60 g wet cells, and the purified protein was concentrated prior to crystallization experiments. Crystals were initially obtained by vapor diffusion at 20 C in 1­5 ml hanging drops that contained equal volumes of a cocktail solution of 7.8 mg/ml protein and 1 mM inhibitor Y-27632, and a reservoir solution consisting of either sodium citrate, ammonium sulfate, PEG6K or PEG8K as a precipitating reagent. Multiple rounds of macro seeding were required to obtain isolated monolithic crystals with increased thickness. Hexagonal rod-shaped crystals were obtained from hanging drops with a reservoir solution containing 0.9 M sodium citrate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 6.3 mM FOS-Choline-9. All data sets were measured from frozen crystals cryoprotected in 20% (w/v) glycerol. A preliminary data set was collected at home using an R-AXIS VII area detector mounted on an FR-E X-ray generator (RIGAKU). Judged from the merging statistics and systematic absences, the crystals belong to a primitive hexagonal space group, either P6222 or P6422. A data set for structure determination and refinement was collected on DIP6040 imaging plates (Bruker-AXS) at the synchrotron 305

Fig. 1. Structure of the Rho-kinase-Y-27632 complex. (a) Ribbon diagram showing the overall dimer structure. The crystallographic dyad that relates two monomers is shown as a black oval in the center. Three helices (aA1, aA2 and aA3) of the N-terminal extension are labeled for one monomer (pink), and colored separately for two protomers in pink and cyan. The C-terminal extension (residues 399­417) is colored orange. Helices and b-strands in the catalytic core are colored green and red, respectively. The phosphate binding loop (P-loop), the catalytic loop (C-loop), and the activation loop (A-loop) are colored blue, magenta and yellow, respectively. The bound inhibitor Y-27632 is shown as a ball-and-stick model in the interlobal cleft. The segments (residues 389­398; broken lines) and the N-terminal seven residues (residues 18­24) were omitted in our

structural model due to poor electron density. (b) A close-up view of the Y-27632 binding in the ATP binding cleft of Rho-kinase. The catalytic domain and the inhibitor are shown as in (a). The AMP-PNP molecule of PKA (PDB code: 1CDK) that is superposed on Rho-kinase is shown as a grey stick model. The associated magnesium ions are shown as black spheres. The main-chain bonds between residues 171 and 172 in addition to the side-chains of residues 219 and 232 are shown as ball-and-stick models, where polar interactions with the inhibitor are indicated by thin lines. (c) A close-up stereoview of the inhibitor Y-27632 bound to Rho-kinase. Electron density (countered at 2.5s) was computed using (2Fo­Fc) coefficients and phases from a model obtained following simulated annealing with the inhibitor and the Phe103 side chain omitted.

beamline BL44XU at SPring-8 in Japan, and was processed and scaled using program suite HKL2000 (16) (Table 1). Crystallographic structure determination was carried out in a standard manner (16­18). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using Molrep (17) with our previously reported Rho-kinase-fasudil complex structure (15) as a search model and was then refined using REFMAC5 (19). The stereochemical quality of the model was monitored using the program PROCHECK (20). The final model contains no outlier in the Ramachandran plot defined by PROCHECK with 99.7% residues in the most favourable and additional allowed regions. The structure revealed a functional dimer formed by head-to-head association of the N-terminal extension (residues 18­84) that folds into 3 helices (aA1,aA2, and aA3)

(Fig. 1a). Two aA2 helices self-assemble through leucine zipper-like interactions around the crystallographic dyad axis, which exemplifies the hydrophobic nature of the dimer interface. The catalytic core domain shows the canonical protein kinase fold consisting of a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe. The very end of the C-terminal extension (residues 399­417) is sandwiched between helix aA2 and the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain. In our crystal, Thr249 in the activation loop (A-loop), a putative phosphorylation site, is not phosphorylated, whereas the loop adopts in an extended conformation providing accessibility of the catalytic center for substrates. Similarly, another putative phosphorylation site, Thr414, located at the hydrophobic motif is not

Fig. 2. Comparison of the Y-27632 molecules bound to Rhokinase and PKA. A close-up view from the interior of the cleft. The kinase domains of Rho-kinase and PKA are superposed as in Table 2. The Ca trace of Rho-kinase is shown in purple (P-loop), orange (C-loop), cyan (N lobe) and blue (C lobe), and that of PKA in gray. The side chains of Phe103, Asn219, Asp232 and Ala231 of Rho-kinase are shown. The side chain of PKA Thr183, which is a corresponding residue to Ala231 of Rho-kinase is also shown. Hydrogen bonds are indicated with thin lines. Y-27632 has the terminal amino group hydrogen bonding to Rho-kinase Asn219 and Asp232 with the pyridine ring forming a common hydrogen bond to the main chain of Rho-kinase Met172 (PKA Val123). The flipped terminal amino group of Y-27632 bound to PKA forms an alternative hydrogen bond to the main chain (PKA Thr51) of the P loop. Table 2. Structural alignments.

phosphorylated either. Nonetheless, two lobes of the catalytic core domain are in a closed active form and the relative position of the key catalytic residues (Lys121, Glu140, Asp214, Asn219 and Asp232 in Rho-kinase) is consistent with that found in active protein kinases, with small rms ° Ca distances being less than 0.8 A when compared with the active closed form of PKA (PDB code: 1CDK). These structural features are virtually the same as the Rho-kinasefasudil complex (15). Y-27632 binds to the inter-subdomain cleft where substrate ATP is known to bind, but a significant overlap of atoms is only observed between the pyridine ring of Y-27632 and the adenine moiety of ATP when superposed in the cleft (Fig. 1b and the drug chemical structure in Fig. 4a). Although contacts between Y-27632 and the kinase domain are mainly hydrophobic, two specific polar interactions hold the elongated Y-27632 molecule on both ends (Fig. 2). Deep in the cleft, a hydrogen bond is formed between the main-chain amide group of Met172 and the pyridine nitrogen atom of the inhibitor. On the other end, the terminal amino group forms two hydrogen bonds to the two catalytic residues, Asn219 and Asp232. Interestingly, this amino group is placed almost exactly at the site where Asn219 and Asp232 should hold one of the ATP-associated magnesium ions that bridges the a- and g-phosphate oxygen atoms (Fig. 1b).

Compared with PKA, the inhibitor binding site of Rho-kinase contains nonconservative residues, Ile98, Met172, Ala231, Asp176 and Asp218, which are replaced with Leu, Val, Thr, Glu and Glu residues in PKA, respectively. Of these, Asp176 and Asp218, which form hydrogen bonds to fasudil, do not participate in the direct interactions with Y-27632 in either Rho-kinase or PKA. Ala231 of Rho-kinase and its counter part Thr183 of PKA is located at the interior of the cleft.

Fig. 3. Structural differences between Rho-kinase and ROCK I. (a) The kinase domains of Rho-kinase and ROCK I bound to Y-27632 are superposed. The bound inhibitor is shown as a balland-stick model. The Ca traces of ROCK I are shown as thin grey lines. The Rho-kinase Ca trace is shown as thick cyan sticks. Seg° ments that have more than 1.0 A Ca distances between Rho-kinase and ROCK I are shown in magenta and labeled; the P-loop (residues 101­104), the A-loop (240­254), helix aB (126­135), a 4-residue bulge insertion segment (as against PKA) adjacent to the A-loop (265­268), and helix aG (397­301). The segment comprising resi-

dues 399­409 preceding the hydrophobic motif in the C-terminal extension also shows significant deviation. Certain minor changes are seen in junctions between secondary structural elements including the regions between helices aD and aE (residue 185), at the beginning of aH (318­320), and between helix aI and the C-terminal extension (357­358). (b) A close-up view of the Y-27632 binding site. The side chains of residues Phe103 and Leu221 of Rho-kinase are yellow and labeled.

induce a slight but significant difference in orientation of Y-27632 (Fig. 2). The pyridine nitrogen atoms of Y-27632 occupy the same position in Rho-kinase and PKA by forming a common hydrogen bond to the main chain, whereas the rest of the inhibitor bound to PKA is shifted by more ° than 1 A toward outside of the cleft by making contacts with the bulky side chain of Thr183. The shift destabilizes the hydrogen bond to Asp183 (Asp232 of Rho-kinase) by being distant from this residue. This results in the disordered conformations of the terminal amino group to have two alternative conformations (21). In the alternative conformation, the amino group of Y-27632 flips to form a single hydrogen bond to the main chain of the P-loop (Thr51). Ile98 and Met172 also induce subtle structural variations between Rho-kinase and PKA. The most significant difference is found in the P-loop conformations (Fig. 2). Like the Rho-kinase P-loop in the fasudil-bound form (Molecule A) (15), the Rho-kinase P-loop in the Y-27632-bound form displays an induced-fit conformational change for binding Y-27632, where the loop is folded toward inside with a flip of the Phe103 side chain to increase surface complementarity with the inhibitor. PKA exhibits no such induced-fit in the P-loop. The differences in the P-loop conformations and the Y-27632 positions result in an increased number (33 contacts) of the

inhibitor-protein contacts in the Rho-kinase than that (22 contacts) in PKA. These observations could provide the structural basis for the high selectivity of Y-27632. The Phe103 conformation in our structure might represent an important part of the inhibitor binding mechanism. The very first case of such an induced-fit mechanism of inhibitor binding in the P-loop region was observed in the structure of the FGF receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain in complex with the specific inhibitor SU5402 (23). This conformational change of the P-loop reflects its flexible nature to function as a flap on the bound substrate ATP. In the Rho-kinase-fasudil complex, the same kind of conformational change in the P-loop was observed in one of the two crystallographically independent molecules. In that case, the inhibitor appears to alter its conformation significantly to accommodate the Phe103 side chain. The overall structures, except for the P-loop region, align best between the Y-27632 complex and the other fasudil complex in which Phe103 does not participate in inhibitor binding. Y-27632 possesses more contacts than fasudil in the Rho-kinase catalytic domain, which might explain the better binding of Y-27632 compared with fasudil. The Rho-kinase-Y-27632 complex superposes slightly better on the ROCK I-Y-27632 complex than on the

In the Rho-kinase-Y-27632 complex structure, residues were identified as possessing significant interactions with the bound Y-27632, based on calculations using CONTACT in the CCP4 suite. Using LSQMAN (24) with the default distance cut-off criteria, 575 eukaryotic protein kinase structures in the PDB were aligned individually on the Rho-kinase-Y-27632 structure. The resulting alignments were sorted in the order of rms distances and number of aligned residues. For further analyses, 27 structures were selected that retained the residues in the alignment: 2ETR (chain A and B), 2ETK (chain A and B), 2ESM (chains A and B), 2ETO (chains A and B), 2C1A (chain A), 1O6L (chain A), 1YDS (chain A), 2ERZ (chain A), 1JLU (chain A), 1O6K (chain A), 1YDR (chain A), 1APM (chain A), 1JPB (chain A), 1YDT (chain A), 2CPK (chain A), 1ATP (chain A), 1BKX (chain A), 1BX6 (chain A), 1FMO (chain A), 2C1B (chain A), 1CDK (chains A and C), 1L3R (chain A). The superposed structures were visually inspected using the program O. The inhibitors are balanol (1BX6), N-(2-(3-(4-bromophenyl)allylamino)ethyl)isoquinoline5-sulfonamide (1YDT), N-(2-(2(4-chlorobenzyloxy)ethylamino)ethyl)isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide (2C1A) and N-(((2S,4R)-4(4-chlorobenzyloxy)pyrrolidin-2yl)methyl)isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide (2C1B). Except for balanol, these inhibitors are structurally related in that they possess two aromatic rings, an isoquinoline ring and a halogenated benzene ring, connected by 8- or 9-atom spacers.

Vol. 140, No. 3, 2006

structural differences between Rho-kinase and ROCK I are found in loop regions including the P-loop (residues 101­104), helix aB (residues 126­135) and the segment comprising residues 399­409 preceding the hydrophobic motif in the C-terminal extension (Fig. 3a). Of the differences

310 observed in side-chain conformations between Rho-kinase and ROCK I, those of Phe103 and Leu221 seem relevant to inhibitor binding (Fig. 3b). As mentioned above, the P-loop in our Rho-kinase structure has a so-called `folded' conformation with the side-chain phenyl group of Phe103 that is turned inward and is sandwiched between the P-loop and the bound Y-27632 molecule. Contrary to this, the corresponding phenyl ring in ROCK I is projected outward and stabilized through hydrophobic interactions with the methionine and phenylalanine residues in helix aB. The absence of these interactions in our Rho-kinase might be cause of flexibility in helix aB. In Rho-kinase, Leu221 comprises part of the hydrophobic stage for binding to the aromatic rings of substrate ATP as well as inhibitor molecules. While it maintains the most favorable rotamer conformation, the equivalent residue in ROCK I, Leu205, shows one of the most unfavorable conformations. This difference was also observed between our previously reported Rho-kinase-fasudil complex and the PKA-fasudil complex structures. The number of van der Waals contacts with the bound ligand is increased in the stable rotamer of the Rho-kinase, because of the protruding terminal methyl groups. This might simply reflect differences in the binding affinity. Other kinases that might possess similar modes of kinase-inhibitor complex formation as that found in the Rho-kinase-Y-27632 complex were then sought. To this end, 575 protein kinase structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were individually superposed to our Rho-kinase structure by least square fitting of the corresponding residues involved in Y-27632 binding to Rho° kinase. Structures with rms Ca distances less than 0.6 A were examined further. As expected, the best aligned were those structures of ROCK I, although several structures of PKA in complex with various inhibitors also stood out. Four inhibitors (PDB codes: 1BX6, 1YDT, 2C1A and 2C1B) bind to PKA with their aromatic rings in virtually the same position as that occupied by the Phe103 side chain in our Rho-kinase-Y-27632 complex (Fig. 4). This suggests the presence of a pocket beneath the phosphatebinding loop that favors binding of a small aromatic ring. Except for balanol (Fig. 4, b and c), these inhibitors are structurally related in that they possess two aromatic rings, an isoquinoline ring and a halogenated benzene ring, connected by 8- or 9-atom spacers. The structure of the Rho-kinase-Y-27632 complex showed a closed ``active'' conformation even without phosphorylation of the activation loop. The overall conformation of Rho-kinase seems to be dictated by the bound inhibitor that affects the relative position of contact residues within the interlobal cleft. The intrinsic flexibility of the phosphate-binding loop facilitates a conformational change to a ``folded'' form. To date, no physiological role has been associated with the flip-in/flip-out motion of the phenyl ring at the tip of the P-loop in our structure. However, it is certain that additional stability is gained during Y-27632 binding by an induced-fit conformational change in Rho-kinase. This might represent yet another case of induced-fit binding in protein kinases. The conserved Phe103 at the tip of the phosphate-binding loop rotates its side-chain phenyl group and interleaves the loop and bound ligand. Such placement of the Phe103 side-chain might encourage the development of novel modification

H. Yamaguchi et al. schemes of current protein kinase inhibitors. By modifying Y-27632 to introduce an additional aromatic ring that can occupy the corresponding site to the Phe103 side-chain, more stable binding can be achieved while maintaining the natural conformation of the P-loop in Rho-kinase.
