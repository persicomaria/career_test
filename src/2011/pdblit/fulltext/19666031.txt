In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, signal transduction through pathways governing mating, osmoregulation, and nitrogen starvation depends upon a direct interaction between the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains of the Ste11 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) and its regulator Ste50. Previously, we solved the NMR structure of the SAM domain from Ste11 and identified two mutants that diminished binding to the Ste50 SAM domain. Building upon the Ste11 study, we present the NMR structure of the monomeric Ste50 SAM domain and a series of mutants bearing substitutions at surface-exposed hydrophobic amino acid residues. The mid-loop (ML) region of Ste11-SAM, defined by helices H3 and H4 and the end-helix (EH) region of Ste50-SAM, defined by helix H5, were sensitive to substitution, indicating that these two surfaces contribute to the high-affinity interaction. The combination of two mutants, Ste11SAM-L72R and Ste50-SAM-L69R, formed a high-affinity heterodimer unencumbered by competing homotypic interactions that had prevented earlier NMR studies of the wild-type complex. Yeast bearing mutations that prevented the heterotypic Ste11-Ste50 association in vitro presented signaling defects in the mating and high-osmolarity growth pathways.

Introduction
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste50 provides an essential link between membrane-bound sensors and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways governing the response to mating pheromone,1 osmotic stress,2 and nitrogen starvation.3 At 348 amino acid residues, Ste50 is an adaptor protein with an amino-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain and a carboxy-terminal Ras association (RA) domain.4,5 The SAM domain couples Ste50 with the SAM domain of the MAPKKK, Ste11.6 The RA domain has an affinity for heterotrimeric G

proteins, Cdc42, and Ras1/Ras2.5 Of these protein partners, Cdc42 is a cofactor in all three major responses, which recruits the upstream Ste20 MAPKKKK. Together, Ste11, Ste50, Cdc42, and Ste20 comprise a membrane-associated protein complex that can be tuned by phosphorylation, scaffolding proteins, feedback, protein turnover, and additional protein partnerships.7 Yeast possessing an impaired or deleted ste50 gene present a number of functional deficiencies. Upon exposure to pheromone, ste50D yeast cannot maintain G1 cell-cycle arrest and therefore exit the mating program.1 As over-expression of Ste11 can partially restore this condition, it suggests that Ste50 operates as an adaptor that couples many signaling proteins to achieve a persistent response.3 Induction of a filamentation response through Ras2 as a result of nitrogen starvation is severely attenuated in the absence of Ste50.3 Finally, ste50D yeast cannot thrive in highly osmotic media if the Ste50-independent Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1/2 osmosensing pathway is also ablated.8 The SAM domain9 is a versatile 70 amino acid residue motif that is known to participate in protein­protein, protein­lipid,10 and protein­RNA

Results
NMR structure of the Ste50 SAM domain The S. cerevisiae Ste50 SAM domain was expressed as a His6-tagged fragment spanning amino acid residues 28­107. Based on 1255 NOEderived distance restraints and 69 torsion angle restraints, the structure of the monomeric Ste50 SAM domain was solved with a backbone atom ° precision of 0.75 A (Table 1 and Figure 1). The Ste50 SAM core (residues 37­101) demonstrates a typical five-helix bundle (H1, 37­48; H2, 55­62; H3, 70­72; H4, 75­81, H5, 86­101) that is the hallmark of this motif. Amino acid residues that contribute to the hydrophobic core include W35, V40, W43, C44, L48, T53, L56, C57, L60, I65, L70, L73, C78, L81, C82, A89, F92, I96, and M99. The secondary structural elements of the Ste50 SAM structure presented here superimpose with a previously published NMR structure (PDB code 1UQV) to ° 1.31 A root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). 15 The only significant main-chain deviation between the two structures occurs at a poorly defined region leading from the end of helix H1 into the beginning of helix H2. The five cysteine residues (C44, C57, C74, C78, and C82) in the Ste50 SAM domain were observed in their reduced form and could be substituted individually with alanine. However, a Ste50 SAM domain bearing all five alanine substitutions was insoluble. The quadruple mutants (C44A/C57A/ C74A/C78A) and (C44A/C57A/C78A/C82A) were soluble, but aggregated at concentrations greater than 0.2 mM. The triple mutant (C44A/ C57A/C74A) was soluble and stable at high concentrations. The results of this survey suggest at least one of C78 or C82 must be present in helix

interactions.11,12 In the human genome, SAM domains are predicted in over 200 signaling proteins and transcription factors.13 S. cerevisiae is well suited for the study of SAM domains in a simplified context, as there are relatively few SAM domains in its genome. Previously, we solved the structure of the Ste11SAM domain and demonstrated that it bound Ste50-SAM with high affinity (w70 nM).14 Using the Ste11­SAM structure as a framework, we identified a number of surface mutations that disrupted the Ste11­Ste50 interaction both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we present the structure determination of the Ste50 SAM domain and an expanded set of surface mutants that disrupt the heterotypic interaction. These data suggest that the biologically relevant, high-affinity interaction arises through the coupling of the mid-loop (ML) surface of the Ste11 SAM domain with the end-helix (EH) surface of the Ste50 SAM domain. With its identification in S. cerevisiae, the EH­ML binding

144 H4 to support a sufficient number of hydrophobic contacts in the Ste50 SAM domain core. Surface-exposed hydrophobic amino acid residues cluster at distinct sites The binding interface observed in the homoand heterotypic SAM partnerships of Ph,16 and Tel,17 Yan/Mae,18 and Ph/Scm19 brings together hydrophobic amino acid residues from helices H3 and H4 on one partner with hydrophobic residues from helix H5 on the other partner. The surfaces specified by helices H3/H4 and helix H5 are named ML and EH, respectively, according to their position on the Tel SAM domain.20 A sequence alignment of the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains with several known SAM protein partners is presented in Figure 2. The ML region of the Ste11 SAM domain tends to be hydrophobic, while the EH region is populated by hydrophilic and charged amino acid residues. An opposite bias is evident for the Ste50 SAM domain. These two observations suggest that the ML surface of the Ste11 SAM domain may make complementary interactions with the EH surface of the Ste50 SAM domain. Guided by the primary sequence analysis, several hydrophobic amino acid residues ware selected as potential interaction sites. The structures of the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains were then used to further refine this group according to the degree of solvent exposure. In total, four Ste11 SAM domain mutants (Y54R, I59R, A62D, and L72R) and ten Ste50 SAM domain mutants (T47R, V50R, I68R, L69R, L86R, N87D, N87R, I90K, K91E, and I94R) were prepared. Each SAM domain mutant was 15 N-labeled and assessed by 1H,15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra to ensure the SAM domain fold had been preserved. A protein sample of an additional EH surface mutant, Ste11-SAM-I68R, aggregated at concentrations O0.5 mM. As a result, Ste11-SAM-I68R was excluded from this study.

An in vitro surface plasmon resonance binding survey identifies key EH and ML surface sites BIAcore surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a sensitive technology for studying protein­ligand interactions. An SPR experiment is performed by immobilizing one component on a sensor chip and then flowing the other component over it for a short period of time. Refractive index changes at the chip surface during the associative and dissociative stages of binding create a characteristic sensorgram. From the ratio of on-rates and off-rates derived from the sensorgram, a dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated. Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains bearing amino-terminal glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and His6 affinity tags were immobilized onto sensor chips that were either pretreated with monoclonal antibodies that capture these affinity tags, or were derivatized with nickel nitrilo-triacetic acid (Ni-NTA). Untagged proteins were used in the mobile phase. Since the Kd of immobilized Ste11SAM with mobile Ste50-SAM (70 nM) was similar to the Kd of immobilized Ste50-SAM with mobile Ste11-SAM, we concluded that immobilization does not impair interactions between the SAM domains. Previously, we identified two Ste11-SAM ML surface mutants that reduced (Y54R) or abolished (I59R) binding to Ste50-SAM.14 Here, we report one additional ML surface mutant, Ste11-SAM-A62D, which abolishes binding to Ste50-SAM (Table 2). These three amino acid residues, and others, whose substitution reduces or abolishes the Ste11­Ste50 interaction are colored red in Figures 2 and 3. A reciprocal binding study using a set of Ste50 SAM domain mutants was performed. No binding was observed between the Ste50 EH surface mutant I90K and immobilized wild-type Ste11-SAM (Table 2). In contrast, two other Ste50 EH surface mutants, L86R and I94R, that are adjacent to I90 by one turn on helix H5, bound Ste11-SAM with affinities that were comparable to that of wild-type Ste50-SAM. The remaining Ste50-SAM mutants demonstrated wild-type level affinities for Ste11-SAM (data not presented).

Boxed amino acids contribute to the hydrophobic core. Substitution of amino acid residues colored black or red disrupts SAM­SAM interactions. Substitution of amino acid residues colored green reduces low-affinity homotypic interactions in the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains. Substitution of amino acid residues colored blue does not affect the Ste11/Ste50 SAM interaction. The secondary structural elements of the Ste50 SAM domain are indicated as rectangles along the bottom.

Next, we asked if the combination of two mutants would produce a synergistic reduction in binding affinity. On its own, Ste11-SAM-Y54R produced a tenfold reduction in binding affinity with Ste50SAM. When Ste11-SAM-Y54R was combined with Ste50-L86R or Ste50-SAM-I94R, binding was reduced to levels beyond the detection limit of the BIAcore method (KdO10 mM). From this result, we speculate that, for the case of a singly substituted arginine residue, the aliphatic portion of the sidechain makes sufficient hydrophobic contacts to preserve binding, and the guanidino group can be

excluded from the binding site. However, two arginine substitutions cannot be accommodated, presumably due to charge­charge repulsion. The combined results from the mutagenesis study identify the ML surface of Ste11-SAM and the EH surface of Ste50-SAM as the primary highaffinity interaction sites. The three Ste11 SAM mutants and the three Ste50 SAM mutants form complementary, hydrophobic paths across each surface (Figure 3). A head-to-tail configuration of Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM bridging these surfaces is consistent with other known EH­ML interactions.

146 A high-affinity, heterodimeric complex of the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains Dynamic light-scattering and atomic force microscopy studies have shown that the Ste11Ste50 SAM hetero-oligomers form spherical ° aggregates that can be as large as 1400 A.21 As a result, a high-resolution NMR structure determination of a wild-type Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM complex is not possible. We reasoned that if mutants such as Ste11-SAMI59R and Ste50-SAM-I90K could block the Ste11­ Ste50 ML­EH interaction, other mutants could be designed to block the alternative Ste11­Ste50 interaction. On the assumption that the alternative interaction brought together the EH surface of Ste11-SAM and the ML surface of Ste50-SAM, the

mutants Ste11-SAM-L72R and Ste50-SAM-L69R were prepared. These amino acid residues are colored green in Figures 2 and 3. Ste11-SAM-L72R was titrated into a 0.5 mM sample of 13C,15N-labeled Ste50-SAM-L69R. At each titration point, a 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum was acquired. Chemical-shift and line-broadening changes observed in the NMR spectra appeared to cease at a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that the mutant complex was heterodimeric. Although the mutant complex produced dramatically better NMR spectra than the wild-type complex, concentrations of NaCl up to 0.7 M were required to preserve the sample over a period of weeks. The majority of amide resonances were assigned using a combination of HNCA and 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra. Once

147 results suggest that the EH surface of Ste50-SAM is the high-affinity contact site for Ste11-SAM. A similar titration performed with Ste50-SAML69R and 13C,15N-labeled Ste11-SAM-L72R presented an array of changes in 1H,15N-HSQC spectra (Figure 5). At the ML surface, amide resonances exhibited line-broadening in the region spanning E49-D58 of Ste11. This region was flanked by large chemical shift changes from I42-T48 and I59-L60. Together, the line-broadening and chemical-shift changes further define the ML surface Ste11-SAM to be the primary contact site for Ste50SAM. Notably, minor chemical-shift changes were observed across one side of helix H5. At the

the chemical-shift assignments of the free and bound states were known, the magnitudes of the 1 H and 15N shifts for each amide resonance were calculated. Since SAM domains do not experience any significant conformational changes upon oligomerization, the observed differences in chemicalshift and line-broadening are likely due to local changes in the electronic environment of the binding site upon presentation of the SAM domain protein partner. The largest amide chemical-shift changes between the free and bound states of Ste50SAM-L69R were associated with amino acid residues at the EH surface, including those that were sensitive to substitution (Figure 4). Therefore, these

or unanticipated conformational changes. In absolute terms, however, high-affinity binding (0.6 mM) was still preserved. An analytical gel-filtration study was performed to assess the oligomeric state of the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains (Figure 6). Dilute solutions (20 mM) were used to reduce self-association. Individually, the Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM demonstrated retention times reflecting a slightly larger molecular mass (w14 kDa) than their true molecular mass (Ste11-SAM, 10.0 kDa; Ste50-SAM, 11.1 kDa). In the Ste11-SAM and Ste11-SAM-L72R chromatograms, the only peak present was attributed to the monomeric form. A minor peak in the Ste50 chromatogram was assigned to the homodimeric, possibly oxidized, form. Stoichiometric mixtures of Ste11-SAM/Ste50-SAM and Ste11-SAM-L72R/ Ste50-SAM-L69R produced markedly different chromatograms. While several oligomeric forms were observed in the wild-type chromatogram, only one form was observed in the mutant SAM domain mixture. Since the retention time of the mutant complex was similar to the homodimeric form of Ste50-SAM, we conclude that the mutant complex is a 21.1 kDa heterodimer. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation was performed with fresh samples of Ste11SAM-L72R, Ste50-SAM-L69R and the mutant complex (Figure 7). Samples of Ste11-SAM-L72R, Ste50-SAM-L69R and the mutant complex were analyzed at concentrations of 370 mM, 60 mM, and 26 mM, respectively. Like the analytical gel-filtration study, the individual Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains exhibited anomalously high molecular mass (Ste11SAM-L72R, 13 kDa; Ste50-SAM-L69R, 14 kDa). The mutant complex sedimented according to a molecular mass of 29 kDa, which is similar to a 1:1 sum of the individual components (27 kDa). Molecular modeling of the Ste11/Ste50 SAM partnership The mutagenesis and NMR data suggest that the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains achieve a high affinity interaction through the coupling of their respective ML and EH interfaces. The essential hydrophobic amino acids at each interacting surface align themselves along a strip (Figure 3). In the Ste50 SAM domain, this strip is formed by the placement of L86, I90 and I94 across one face of helix H5. Using these hydrophobic strips as a guide for the interaction, two possible orientations are possible. Following the typical EH­ML interaction observed from crystal structures, the amino terminus of helix H5 in Ste50-SAM is proximal to the carboxy termini of helices H2 and H4 in Ste11SAM. Alternatively, the orientation of helix H5 in Ste50-SAM could be rotated 1808 such that its amino terminus is close to helix H3 in Ste11-SAM. A molecular model of the Ste11/Ste50 SAM domain heterodimer was constructed from the Drosophila Ph/Scm structure. 19 Considerable primary sequence homology between Ste11/Ph

concentrations of protein required for the titration (0.5 mM), these changes may reflect a weak, homotypic EH­ML Ste11­Ste11 interaction that could not be eliminated entirely by the L72R mutation and the addition of salt. By BIAcore analysis, an approximate fourfold decrease in relative binding affinity was observed for the Ste11-SAM-L72R/Ste50-SAM complex, a threefold decrease for Ste11-SAM/Ste50-SAML69R complex, and a tenfold decrease for the Ste11-SAM-L72R/Ste50-SAM-L69R complex (Table 2). The decrease in relative binding affinity arising from these substitutions may be due to destabilization

and Ste50/Scm (Figure 2) provided a high level of confidence during the threading procedure. The resulting model is shown in Figure 8. Consistent with the mutagenesis study, the two amino acids that were most sensitive to substitution, Ste11-SAMI59 and Ste50-SAM-I90, are in close contact at the center of the interface. Charged amino acids at the periphery of the hydrophobic core form a network of salt bridges. According to the model, K91 of Ste50-SAM would interact with E50 of Ste11-SAM. From BIAcore binding studies, a Ste50-SAM-K91E mutant demonstrated a threefold decrease in binding relative to the wild-type interaction. This modest decrease is consistent with the loss of a peripheral contact. In vivo characterization of the Ste11/Ste50 partnership SAM domain protein fragments of Ste11 and Ste50 have an intrinsic ability to self-associate, albeit very weakly in comparison to the high-affinity heterotypic interaction.14,15,22 Originating from these in vitro observations, it is speculated that self-association may serve a functional role in vivo by clustering and thereby amplifying the Ste11

catalytic activity.21 By NMR methods, analytical ultracentrifugation and analytical gel-filtration, we have shown that the Ste11-SAM-L72R/Ste50-SAML69R heterodimer retains the SAM domain fold and a high-affinity, heterotypic binding interface while attenuating competing homotypic interactions. Thus, this mutant pair becomes a valuable reagent to ask if low-affinity oligomerization is required to transmit signals through various MAP kinase pathways. For the in vivo studies, myc-tagged ste11 and GSTtagged ste50 genes were used. Yeast that were null for ste11 and ste50 were transformed with these constructs or empty vectors as negative controls. To downplay the effects of homotypic interactions, L72R and L69R SAM domain point mutations were introduced into the ste11 and ste50 genes, respectively. The high-osmolarity growth pathway receives signals from a Ste50-dependent pathway via the Sho1 receptor and from a Ste50-independent pathway via the Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1-Ssk2/22 osmosensor.2,23,24 We assayed the Ste50-dependent pathway exclusively by using yeast strains that were also null for the Ssk2 and Ssk22 MAPKKKs. Yeast deficient in either Ste11 or Ste50 could not thrive

when placed in medium containing 1 M NaCl (Figure 9). On their own, Ste11-SAM-L72R and Ste50-SAM-L69R could substitute for the wild-type protein. Introduction of Ste11-SAM-L72R and Ste50-SAM-L69R also rescued the osmosensing pathway, though the observed densities did not reach wild-type levels over the same period of time. A functional mating pathway was assayed by the extent of growth arrest in response to a-factor. Any combination of wild-type or mutant Ste11 with wild-type or mutant Ste50 resulted in the formation of a halo, indicating strong G1 cell-cycle arrest (Figure 9). Smaller halos were observed when either Ste11 or Ste11-L72R was expressed in the absence of Ste50. Together, these results indicate that the preservation of the heterodimeric interaction is essential for the transmission of signals through the osmoregulatory and mating pathways. Furthermore, these results suggest that Ste11 and Ste50 homotypic interactions are not critical factors in mating and high-salt signal transduction. The EH surface draws many critical contacts from three hydrophobic amino acid residues that occupy one side of helix H5, beginning at the amino terminus. From our in vitro binding studies, the amino acid residues L86, I90 and I94 fulfil this role in the Ste50 SAM domain. The first amino acid residue of this triplet, L86, shares sequence identity with L65 in Ph-SAM and L66 in Scm-SAM. While Ph-SAM homo-oligomers16 and Ph-SAM/ScmSAM hetero-oligomers19 can be disrupted by L65R and L66R substitutions, repectively, an Ste50-L86R mutant binds Ste11-SAM with an affinity comparable to that of wild-type Ste50-SAM (Table 2). In contrast to the in vitro study, over-expression of

GST-Ste50-L86R in ste50D yeast could not fully rescue the mating and osmoregulatory growth pathways (Figure 10). Combined, these in vitro and in vivo observations suggest the SAM domain interaction may be an integral part of a larger signaling complex. Consequently, mutations at surface-exposed sites may produce a number of functional consequences. Yeast coexpressing Ste11-Y54R and Ste50-L86R did not form growth-arrest halos upon presentation of a-factor and did not grow in medium containing

Discussion
SAM domains have the fascinating distinction of being ligands for themselves. By supporting both homo- and heterotypic interactions, regulation may be achieved through competition of one SAM domain ligand for another. For example, the Drosophila transcription factor Yan homooligomerizes through a head-to-tail interaction of alternating EH and ML surfaces. Biologically, selfassociation serves a dual role by enhancing the repressor function of Yan,18 and preventing its deactivation by nuclear export.25 Mae, the SAM domain partner of Yan, has a 1000-fold stronger affinity for Yan, than Yan itself.18 Between these two proteins, the relative affinity of the ML surface is the arbiter that determines whether homo- or heterotypic interactions predominate. EH and ML surface interactions also drive the self-association of the human Tel SAM domain,20 the self-association of the Drosophila Ph SAM domain,16 and the highaffinity interaction between Ph and Scm.19 Under conditions of low pH and high concentration, the Ste11-SAM domain will oligomerize.22 Our previous study, which used a combination of NMR spectroscopy and mutagenesis, suggested that oligomerization of the Ste11-SAM domain was driven by the complementarity between its own EH and ML surfaces.14 In this study, we used in vitro and in vivo methods to show that the ML surface of the Ste11-SAM domain interacts with the EH surface of the Ste50-SAM domain, and that formation of a heterodimer was sufficient to support signal transduction through the mating and osmoregulatory pathways. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Ste4 and Byr2 are the orthologs of Ste50 and Ste11. These two proteins serve a function analogous to that of Ste50 and Ste11 by transmitting signals through the mating pathway. Unlike their counterparts in S. cerevisiae, the high-affinity interaction (KdZ19 nM) between Ste4 and Byr2 occurs at a 3:1 ratio.26 Trimerization of Ste4 is directed by a leucine zipper motif that is located immediately N-terminal to the SAM domain. From sequence analysis, the leucine zipper motif appears to be absent from Ste50. If the leucine zipper motif in Ste4 is deleted, Ste4 and Byr2 interact in a 1:1 ratio accompanied by O1000-fold reduction in binding affinity.26 The observed differences between the stoichiometries of these SAM domain partners likely reflects the considerable evolutionary distance between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae.27 If the EH­ML surface coupling of Ste50 and Ste11 is analogous to the crystal structures of other known EH­ML interacting partners, hydrophobic amino acid residues along one side of helix H5 in Ste50SAM are expected to make hydrophobic contacts with a complementary strip of hydrophobic amino acid residues from helices H3 and H4 of the Ste11SAM. Supported by mutagenesis, L86, I90, and I94 of the Ste50 SAM domain appear to serve this role. The Ste11/Ste50 SAM partnership, as a typical EH­ML driven association, was assessed by

Figure 10. An L86R EH surface mutation in Ste50 does not fully rescue and (a) the HOG pathway as determined by cell density after 24 h growth in medium containing 1 M NaCl or (b) the mating pathway as determined by the extent of growth arrest assessed using halo assays in response to mating pheromone. (c) Western blot analyses using whole cell yeast lysates were performed to assess the relative expression of Ste50 (anti-GST) while actin levels were determined as a protein loading control.

1 M NaCl (data not presented) indicating that the mating and osmoregulatory pathways have been decoupled. These functional outcomes in vivo are consistent with the absence of binding that was observed in vitro between Ste11-SAM-Y54R and Ste50-SAM-L86R (Table 2). The molecular model presented in Figure 8 amalgamates our experimental observations and highlights the possible structural similarities at the EH­ML interaction sites of Ste50/Ste11 and Scm/Ph. As observed in the crystal structures of the Ph homo-oligomer16 and the Ph/Scm hetero-oligomer,19 the hydrophobic contacts at the EH surface begin at the N terminus of helix H5 and continue for two turns. If the first, most N-terminal amino acid residue is substituted (L65R in Ph,16 L66R in Scm19), interactions at the EH surface are prevented. The N-terminal amino acid residue in Ste50-SAM is also leucine. From the BIAcore binding investigation, Ste50-SAM-L86R demonstrated a binding affinity for Ste11-SAM that was similar to that of wild-type Ste50 (Table 2). In contrast to the in vitro study, overexpression of GST-Ste50-L86R in ste50D yeast could not fully rescue the mating and osmoregulatory growth pathways (Figure 10). This result suggests that the Ste50 SAM domain may be engaged in additional intra- and intermolecular protein partnerships that help maintain the intensity or duration of signals through the MAP kinase signaling pathways. Consistent with the in vitro observations, yeast co-expressing Ste11-Y54R and Ste50-L86R were not sensitive to mating pheromone and could not grow in medium containing 1 M NaCl (data not presented).

152 molecular modeling using the Ph/Scm SAM crystal structure as a template. The two strips of hydrophobic amino acid residues from the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains formed a tight core with a supporting network of salt-bridges at the periphery. The in vivo results demonstrate that the mating and osmoregulatory pathways do not require homotypic oligomerization of either Ste11 or Ste50. We cannot rule out that the tenfold relative decrease in binding affinity observed in vitro between the wild-type and Ste11-SAM-L72R/ Ste50-SAM-L69R double mutant complexes had no effect in vivo, as reduced growth levels were observed in the high-salt growth assay. It should be noted, however, that the absolute binding affinity of the double mutant was still very high (Kd/1 mM). As Ste11 and Ste50 participate in dynamic signaling complexes coordinated by scaffolding proteins, the effective affinity of all the components may determine the period and intensity of the transmitted signal. In that regard, the identification and use of Ste50 mutants that reduce binding significantly, but not completely, may be more diagnostic. Additional improvements to the sensitivity of the in vivo Ste50 rescue experiments may be achieved by using an endogenous Ste50 promoter to drive expression. In the absence of Ste50-specific antibodies, GST-tagged Ste50 was used in conjunction with an anti-GST antibody. It is possible that the Ste11/Ste50 signaling complex may have been influenced by the presence of the 25 kDa GST affinity tag. Our future efforts will be directed toward a highresolution structural determination of the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domain partnership. Towards this goal, we are pursuing additional mutants that preserve high-affinity binding and fully eliminate competing homotypic interactions.

isotopically labeled proteins were produced from 1­2 l fermentations with M9 minimal medium supplemented with [15N]ammonium chloride and [13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. Affinity-tagged proteins were purified using glutathione Sepharose or chelating nickel-affinity chromatography for GST-tagged and His6-tagged protein samples, respectively. As required, the GST and His 6 tags were cleaved with thrombin (Sigma) leaving the non-native sequence Gly-Ser at the amino terminus. Protein preparations were further purified by gel-filtration chromatography (Sephadex S-100 16/60 column; GE Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 175 mM NaCl. Mutant Ste50 SAM domain proteins were expressed and isotopically labeled in 15N. Proper folding of each mutant protein was confirmed by comparison of 15 N-HSQC spectra to those obtained from the wild-type Ste50 SAM domain protein. NMR spectroscopy and structure calculations Ste50-SAM protein samples for NMR studies ranged from 0.2­0.7 mM in 10% (v/v) 2H2O, 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol-d7, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. Backbone and side-chain assignments were obtained from 15 N-HSQC, 13C-HSQC, HNCO, HNCACB, H(CCO)NHtotal correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY), and C(CO)NHTOCSY spectra recorded at 20 8C on 500 MHz Varian Unity Inova and 600 MHz Bruker Avance DRX NMR spectrometers. Intramolecular distance restraints were obtained from a 3D 13C-edited and 3D 15N-edited NOESY spectra acquired on a Varian Unity Inova 800 MHz NMR spectrometer with a mixing time of 100 ms. Data were processed and interpreted using nmrPipe 28 and NMRView software.29 No stereospecific assignment was made. Backbone dihedral angles were predicted from chemical shift information using the TALOS method.30 NOE distance restraints were calibrated with the CALIBA module of CYANA v2.0.31 An initial ensemble of 500 structures was calculated with CYANA v2.0 using only NOE restraints. Hydrogen bond restraints (O­HN, ° ° 1.8­2.1 A; O­N, 2.7­3.0 A) were determined by assessing ° the initial ensemble for backbone O­HN distances !2.4 A and bond angles !258. The best 25 structures according to energy were subjected to a water-based refinement32 with XPLOR-NIH v2.9.8 using all NOE and dihedral angles. Ensemble RMSDs of the best 15 structures were calculated with MOLMOL. Ramachandran analysis using PROCHECK-NMR indicates that 93.5% of amino acid residues occur in the most favored regions, with 6.1% in the additionally allowed regions, 0.4% in the generously allowed regions, and 0.1% in the disallowed regions. Molecular graphics were produced with pyMOL. Surface plasmon resonance Sensorgrams were recorded at 25 8C using a BIAcore X biosensor (BIAcore). Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM proteins were immobilized onto sensor chips derivatized with Ni-NTA or anti-GST monoclonal antibodies. Sensorgrams were corrected for non-specific binding and refractive index changes prior to analysis with BIAevaluation 3.2 (BIAcore) software. Three sets of sensorgrams were each fit independently according to a 1:1 drifting baseline  http://pymol.sourceforge.net

Plasmid construction and mutagenesis A BamHI/EcoRI-flanked PCR product encoding Ste50[28­107] was inserted into plasmid pGEX2T (GE Biosciences) to produce a GST-tagged Ste50 SAM domain. An NcoI/BamHI-flanked PCR product encoding Ste50[28­107] was inserted into plasmid pET15b (Novagen) to produce a His6-tagged Ste50 SAM domain. Construction of GST-tagged and His6-tagged Ste11-SAM expression systems has been described.14 Quikchange mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to make a set of eight amino acid substitutions (T47R, V50R, L69R, L86R, N87R, I90R, K91E, and I94R) in the Ste50 SAM domain, an A62D substitution in the Ste11 SAM domain, an L72R substitution in full-length Ste11, and an L69R substitution in full-length Ste50. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein expression and purification Plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for over-expression. Milligram quantities of

model. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were determined from the mean ratios of kon and koff (KdZkoff/kon). Molecular modeling The Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domain sequences were threaded through the Ph/Scm crystal structure using SWISS-MODEL.33 Analytical gel-filtration chromatography Proteins and protein complexes at a concentration of 20 mM in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 500 mM NaCl, were injected into a Superdex 75 10/30 HR column equilibrated with the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Analytical ultracentrifugation The data were analyzed with UltraScan version 7 using the enhanced van Holde-Weischet method with finite element analysis.34 The samples were sedimented in a two-channel AN60Ti rotor at 60,000 rpm (250,000 g at the center of the cell) and 20 8C for 10 h. Absorption curves were scanned at 280 nm. Hydrodynamic corrections were made for protein partial specific volume, buffer, density and viscosity. Yeast growth assays and Western blot analysis Solid plate and liquid growth curve assays were performed in the appropriate selective medium with or without (data not shown) 1 M NaCl using a ste11/ste50/ ssk2/ssk22 null yeast strain (YCW555) obtained from M. Whiteway. Halo assays were performed in the same strain to assess growth arrest in response to 10 mg of a-factor and scored after 24 h as described.14 Western blot analyses were performed using yeast cell extracts as described.14 Ste11 was probed with an anti-Myc rabbit polyclonal antibody (A14, Santa Cruz) whereas Ste50 was probed with an anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody (B-14, Santa Cruz). Protein content was standardized using an anti-PGK mouse monoclonal antibody (A-6457, Molecular Probes) or an anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibody. Protein Data Bank accession code Coordinates of the structure of the monomeric Ste50 SAM domain have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 1Z1V.
