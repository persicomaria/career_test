L-Asparaginase

Received June 1, 1999
L-Asparaginase (L-asparagine amidohydrase) is a critical component of therapy of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). L-Asparaginase used alone causes complete remission in up to 60% of ALL cases, and in combination with vincristine and corticosteroids, is responsible for nearly 95% complete remission in previously untreated children with ALL (1­3). The enzyme converts Asn to Asp, causes rapid depletion of Asn, and thus suppresses growth of malignant cells that are more dependent on an exogenous source of Asn than normal cells (4 ­ 6). L-Asparaginase sensitivity of leukemic cells seems to have an inverse relation to the degree of asparagine synthetase expression (4, 7). It is also known that L-asparaginase preparation derived from E. coli (such as Elspar) has glutaminase activity as well, and converts Gln to Glu (8, 9). Therefore, it is understood that depletion of both Asn and Gln suppresses cell growth of malignant cells. Growth inhibitory effects of L-asparaginase in vitro is cytostatic rather than cytolytic, and cells apparently withdraw from the cell cycle and enter into a resting or pseudoresting state (10). It remains unclear, however, which signaling events involved in cell proliferation are affected by L-asparaginase. Rapamycin is an anti-proliferative and immunosuppressive macrolide, which can arrest or prolong G1 progression of the cell cycle. The mechanism of its anti-proliferative action is through its binding to an intracellular molecule named mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, also termed FRAP, RAFT) in mammalian cells (11). Rapamycin binds and inhibits mTOR and subsequently inhibits its downstream events, phosphorylation of a protein serine/threonine kinase, p70 S6 kinase (p70 s6k) and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (see reviews, 12, 13). The p70 s6k phosphorylates ribosomal S6 protein in vivo (14), and regulates translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which have a conserved motif at their 5 -terminus (polypyrimidine tract followed by GC-rich structure) (14, 15). The p70 s6k

is widely used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. L-Asparaginase preparation derived from E. coli converts asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln) to aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu), respectively, and causes rapid depletion of Asn and Gln. It thus suppresses growth of malignant cells that are more dependent on an exogenous source of Asn and Gln than are normal cells. It remains unclear, however, which signaling events in leukemic cells are affected by L-asparaginase. Recently, amino acid sufficiency has been demonstrated to selectively regulate p70 S6 kinase (p70 s6k) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), both of which are targeted by the anti-proliferative drug rapamycin. Here we demonstrate that addition of L-asparaginase to human leukemic cells inhibits activity of p70 s6k and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, but not activities of other cell growth-related serine/threonine kinases. The rate and kinetics of p70 s6k inhibition by L-asparaginase were comparable to those seen by deprivation of Asn and/or Gln from cell culture media, suggesting that the effect of L-asparaginase on p70 s6k is explained by depletion of Asn and/or Gln. Moreover, L-Asparaginase as well as rapamycin selectively suppressed synthesis of ribosomal proteins at the level of mRNA translation. These data indicate that L-asparaginase and rapamycin target a common signaling pathway in leukemic cells.

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS Cdk2, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an epitope 283-298 of human Cdk2 (sc-163, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The kinase activity was measured by incorporation of 32P into specific substrate peptides (for p70 s6k and p90 rsk, an S6 peptide, RRRLSSLRA; for Akt, a Gsk3 peptide, GRPRTSSFAEG; for Cdk2, a histone H1 peptide, AVAAKKSPKKAKKPA). Immunoblotting. Cells (5 10 6) were washed with PBS and lysed at 4°C with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 2% NP-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 M PMSF, 50 g/ml aprotinin, 50 M leupeptin. Lysates were resolved by SDS 7.5%-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. After blocking the filters with a solution containing 1% BSA, the filters were incubated with primary antibodies. The antibodies used for p70 s6k were the same as described above. Specific reactive proteins were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method, employing a donkey anti-rabbit Ig antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) as described previously (16). Polysomal association. Polysomal mRNAs were separated from non-polysomal mRNAs by sucrose gradient gels as described previously (27). Briefly, after washing cells (2 10 7) once with PBS, they were suspended for 10 min at 0°C in 1 ml of a buffer containing 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mM MgCl 2, 1.2% Triton X100, 1.2% deoxycholate and a ribonuclease inhibitor, RNasin 200 U/ml (Promega, Madison, WI). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 2.5 min at 10,000 g. The postnuclear supernatant (500 l) was layered over 11 ml of a 0.5 M to 1.5 M sucrose gradient with a 1 ml cushion of 1.5M sucrose. The sucrose solutions contained 2 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, and 100 g of heparin per ml. The gradients were centrifuged at 105,000 g for 3 h at 4°C using a Beckman SW28 rotor. Twelve fractions of 1 ml each were collected and RNA was extracted. RNA from each fraction was then applied to nitrocellulose membranes using a slot blot apparatus. Membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes of human eEF-1 cDNA, and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA (27 and references therein). Radioactivity of slot blots was scanned using the Phosphor Imager and the relative counts in each fraction was determined by Image Quant Analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Metabolic labeling of proteins with [ 35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation. Cells were pretreated with L-asparaginase (10 U/ml) or a vehicle for 15 min, pulse-labeled with 200 Ci/ml of [ 35S]methionine (ICN) for additional 2 h, and lysed at 4 oC with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 2% NP-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 M PMSF, 50 g/ml aprotinin, 50 M leupeptin. The lysates were incubated at 4°C for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against eEF-2 (EF-2 Ab 118) (16, 27) or with a mouse monoclonal antibody against hsp90 (clone 9D2, StressGen, Biotechnologies, Sidney, Canada). Immune complexes were absorbed to protein G/protein A-coupled beads (Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY). Beads were then washed 4 times with RIPA buffer, suspended in the sample loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Precipitated proteins were separated in an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed in methanol/acetate solution, treated with chemiamplifier solution and dried. Radiolabeled eEF-2 (about 97 kD) and hsp90 (about 90 kD) proteins were visualized by autoradiography.

activation by mitogenic stimuli is thought to upregulate synthesis of ribosomal proteins, thus facilitating G1 progression of the cell cycle (16). 4E-BP1 is a translation repressor protein and the hypo-phosphorylated species of 4E-BP1 binds tightly to the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) (a N 7-methylguanosine capbinding subunit of the eIF-4F complex), and prevents eIF-4E from associating with eIF-4G (a scaffolding protein in the eIF-4F complex) (see review, 17, 18). The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is thought to release eIF-4E and facilitate translational initiation of capped mRNA, which is also considered to facilitate cell growth. Thus, through association with mTOR, rapamycin targets two regulators of mRNA translation which are important for cell growth. Recently, deprivation of amino acids from cell culture media was demonstrated to selectively inhibit this mTOR pathway (phosphorylation and activity of p70 s6k and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1) (19, 20, 21, 22). In the present study, we demonstrate that L-asparaginase, which eliminates Asn and Gln in cell culture media, selectively inhibits this rapamycin-targeted signaling pathway in leukemic cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture. Human lymphocytic leukemic cell lines including Jurkat (T-lineage), NALM6 (B precursor), HYON (B precursor) (23), ABON (B precursor) (23), CEM (T-lineage), HAL-01 (B precursor) (24), and REH (B-precursor) (25) were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C in a CO 2-5% incubator. L-Asparaginase (Elspar, Merck, West Point, PA) was dissolved in distilled water and stored at 4°C at a concentration of 5,000 U/ml for up to 1 month. L-Asparaginase (0-10 U/ml) was added to exponentially growing leukemic cells (5 10 5 cells/ml), and cells were incubated for the indicated times at 37°C in a CO 2-5% incubator. For deprivation of Asn and/or Gln, cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in an Asn-free and/or Gln-free RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (FCS, Cat No. 26300, Life Technologies). Asn-free and/or Gln-free RPMI-1640 media were prepared using RPMI-1640 Selectamine kit (Cat No. 17402, Life Technologies). The concentrations ( M) of amino acids (1x) in RPMI-1640 are, Gln, 2050; Asn, 380; His, 100; Trp 24; Pro, 170; Cyst, 410; Gly, 130; Val, 170; Leu, 380; Ile, 380; Ser, 290; Thr, 170; Phe, 90; Tyr, 110; Met, 100; Glu, 140; Asp 150; Arg, 1150; Lys, 220. Cell clones resistant to L-asparaginase were established by sequential incubation of parental Jurkat cells with increasing concentrations of 3 L-asparaginase (from 10 U/ml to 1 U/ml) (7). Kinase assay. Cells (2 10 6) were harvested and the activities of the kinases were measured as we described previously (26). Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl 2, 50 mM -glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na 3VO 4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 40 g/ml PMSF and 0.1% NP40, and the protein kinases were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies; for p70 s6k, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl terminal 18 amino acids of p70 s6k (sc-230, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); for Akt, a goat polyclonal antibody against an epitope corresponding to amino acids 461-480 of human Akt1 (sc-1618, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); for p90 rsk, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an epitope 682 to 724 of mouse Rsk1 (06-185, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); and for

RESULTS inhibits activity of p70 s6k but not of p90 , cdk2, or Akt in Jurkat cells. Initially, we investigated the effects of L-asparaginase on activities of protein serine/threonine kinases including p70 s6k, p90 rsk, Akt and Cdk2 in Jurkat leukemic cells (Fig. 1). p90 rsk is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and it is known to be activated by various

activity was partially decreased by 25% within 6 h. In conclusion, L-asparaginase inhibited p70 s6k with little or no effect on other growth-related serine/threonine kinases examined in Jurkat leukemic cells. inhibits phosphorylation of p70 s6k and 4E-BP1. The phosphorylation status of p70 s6k was then evaluated by mobility shift in immunoblot analysis. The hyperphosphorylated species of p70 s6k which correspond to the active form of the kinase, have a lower mobility in immunoblots; while the hypophosphorylated species which correspond to the inactive form have a higher mobility (32). As shown in Fig. 1B, L-asparaginase increased hypophosphorylated species of p70 s6k within 3 h. These results indicate that s6k L-asparaginase inactivated p70 by inducing dephosphorylation of the kinase. The phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1 was similarly evaluated by mobility shift using immunoblot analysis. The hyperphosphorylated species of 4E-BP1 have a lower mobility in immunoblots; while the hypophosphorylated species have a higher mobility (33). As shown in Fig. 1C, L-asparaginase increased hypophosphorylated species of 4E-BP1 within 3 h. These results indicate that addition of L-asparaginase induce dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 as well.
L-Asparaginase

FIG. 1. L-Asparaginase inhibits p70 s6k activity but not p90 rsk, cdk2 or Akt. Exponentially growing human Jurkat leukemic cells (5 10 5 cells/ml) were treated with 10 U/ml of L-asparaginase (Elspar) for the indicated times (0, 30 min, 3 h, or 6 h). (A) Kinase activity. Cells (2 10 6) were harvested and the specific activity of immunoprecipitated p70 s6k, p90 rsk, Cdk2 or Akt was measured by incorporation of 32P into specific substrate peptides as described in Materials and Methods. Error bars represent standard deviation of the data. Results are representative of one of three similar experiments. (B, C) Immunoblot analysis of p70 s6k and 4EBP-1. Cells were harvested and the cellular lysate was separated by SDS 7.5% (B) or 15% (C)-polyacrylamide gels as described in Materials and Methods. p70 s6k (B) and 4E-BP1 (C) was detected by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies, and the phosphorylation status of p70 s6k and 4E-BP1 was evaluated by mobility shift of the protein. Results are representative of one of four similar experiments.

mitogenic stimuli (28). Akt is another growth factorinduced protein kinase which is regulated through phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) activity (29). In multiple conditions, the activity of Akt has been demonstrated to parallel that of p70 s6k. Cdk2 is a kinase required for G1/S transition of the cell cycle, and its activity is detected exclusively in the late G1 phase to the S phase of the cycle (30, 31). L-Asparaginase (10 U/ml) was added to exponentially growing Jurkat cells, and cells were harvested at the indicated times (30 min to 6 h). As shown in Fig. 1, L-asparaginase decreased p70 s6k activity by 70% within 30 min, and by 80% within 6 h. In contrast, other Ser/Thr kinases were minimally affected by L-asparaginase. p90 rsk was transiently activated by addition of L-asparaginase. A transient activation of p90 rsk was also seen when total amino acids were deprived from the cell culture media (22). The cell cycle regulatory molecule Cdk2 was essentially not altered by L-asparaginase within 6 h. Akt

Dose response of L-asparaginase on p70 s6k activity in Jurkat and other leukemic cells. We next determined the dose response of L-asparaginase on p70 s6k activity. L-Asparaginase is known to inhibit cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 2A, growth of Jurkat cells were inhibited by L-asparaginase at 1 U/ml or higher, and partially at 0.1 U/ml and 0.01 U/ml. L-Asparaginase inhibits p70 s6k activity with a similar dose response to its inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 2B). In addition to Jurkat cells, the effect of s6k L-asparaginase on p70 activity were examined using six other human leukemic lines, established from B-precursor ALL (NALM6, HYON, ABON, HAL-01, REH) and T-lineage ALL (CEM). As shown in Fig. 2C, s6k L-asparaginase inhibited p70 activity in these leukemic cells with a similar dose response to that seen in Jurkat cells. Clones of Jurkat cells resistant to L-asparaginase for cell growth were established by sequential incubation of parental cells with increasing concentrations of L-asparaginase (from 10 3 U/ml to 1 U/ml). These resistant clones are known to express higher levels of asparagine synthetase (7). In contrast to parental Jurkat cells, L-asparaginase poorly inhibited p70 s6k activity in the resistant clone (Fig. 2D). Asn and/or Gln deprivation inhibits p70 s6k activity. L-asparaginase preparation derived from E. coli converts both Asn and Gln to Asp and Glu, respectively, and causes rapid depletion of Asn and Gln (8, 9). In order to investigate whether depletion of Asn and/or Gln by L-asparaginase explains its effects on p70 s6k, we deprived either Asn, Gln or both Asn and Gln from the

FIG. 2. Dose response of L-asparaginase on cell growth and p70 s6k activity. (A, B) Jurkat cells were treated with either 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 or 10 U/ml of L-asparaginase. Cell numbers were counted at the indicated times (days) after treatment with the drug (A). After 6 h of the treatment, Jurkat cells were harvested and p70 s6k activity was measured as described above (B). (C) Human leukemic cell lines, CEM, NALM6, HYON, ABON, HAL-01, and REH cells were treated with either 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 U/ml of L-asparaginase for 6 h. Cells were harvested and p70 s6k activity was measured as described above. Results are representative of one of three similar experiments. (D) Clones resistant to L-asparaginase were produced from Jurkat cells as described in Materials and Methods, treated with L-asparaginase for 6 h, and p70 s6k activity was measured.

culture medium. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, deprivation of Asn alone, Gln alone, or both Asn and Gln inhibited p70 s6k activity to a similar extent with similar kinetics as seen in cells treated with L-asparaginase. L-Asparaginase inhibits translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins. Activation of p70 s6k was determined to upregulate translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins including elongation factors,

which have a specific structure at their 5 terminus (14, 15). Effects of L-asparaginase on the translational status of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins was examined by polysomal association assay. mRNAs involved in active translation which bind to multiple ribosomes (polysomes) are able to separate from mRNAs not bound to ribosomes, using ultra centrifugation on a sucrose gradient. mRNA encoding eEF-1 was exam-

As a control, cells in the regular medium were treated with 10 U/ml of L-asparaginase for the indicated times (L-Asparaginase). Cells were harvested and p70 s6k activity was measured as described above. Results are representative of one of three similar experiments. 537

FIG. 4. L-Asparaginase inhibits synthesis of ribosomal proteins at the level of mRNA translation. (A) Polysomal association. Exponentially growing Jurkat cells (5 10 5 cells/ml) were treated with a vehicle (1/500 volume of water, Control), 10 U/ml of L-asparaginase, or rapamycin (10 ng/ml) for 2 h. Polysomal association status of specific mRNA was measured as described in Materials and Methods. Briefly, cell lysates were fractionated in a sucrose gradient, and specific mRNA in each fragment were measured by slot blot analysis using a cDNA probe encoding eEF-1 or GAPDH, labeled with 32P-dCTP. Polysomal fractions (fractions 2-6) were determined by OD 260 as we previously described (data not shown). The data were shown by % radioactivity of each fraction to radioactivity of total fractions. Results are representative of one of three similar experiments. (B) [ 35S]methionine incorporation. Exponentially growing Jurkat cells were pretreated with L-asparaginase (10 U/ml) or a vehicle for 15 min, and pulse-labeled with 200 Ci/ml of [ 35S]methionine for additional 2 h. eEF-2 and hsp90 were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies and separated in an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed in methanol/ acetate solution, treated with chemiamplifier solution and dried. [ 35S]labeled eEF-2 (about 97 kD) and hsp90 (about 90 kD) was visualized by autoradiography. Results are representative of one of two similar experiments.

ined as a representative of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins. GAPDH mRNA was used as a representative of non-ribosomal protein mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 4A, L-asparaginase (10 U/ml) as well as rapamycin (10 ng/ml), a potent inhibitor of p70 s6k, reduced eEF-1 mRNA in polysomal fractions within 2 h. In contrast, L-asparaginase as well as rapamycin had a minor effect on polysomal association of GAPDH mRNA (Fig. 4B). Similar findings were observed with another set of ribosomal protein mRNA (eEF-2 mRNA) and nonribosomal protein mRNA ( -actin mRNA) (data not shown). In order to confirm the specific effect of L-asparaginase on the synthesis of ribosomal proteins, Jurkat cells were pretreated with L-asparaginase (10 U/ml) for 15 min and metabolically labeled with [ 35S]methionine for additional 2 h. eEF-2 or hsp90 was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig. 4C, treatment of cells with L-asparaginase for 2 h decreased synthesis of eEF-2. In contrast, L-asparaginase did not decrease synthesis of hsp90 within 2 h. These

results indicate that L-asparaginase selectively inhibits translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins in early time periods after drug treatment. DISCUSSION In the present study, we demonstrated early effects of L-asparaginase on signaling events in leukemic cells for the first time. L-Asparaginase inhibited p70 s6k activity and phosphorylation within 30 min and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 within 3 h. These effects of L-asparaginase were specific since activities of other growth-related protein kinases were minimally affected within 6 h. Specifically, no change in Cdk2 activity during this time period suggests that inhibition of p70 s6k occurred by addition of L-asparaginase before any change in cell cycle progression. Additionally, little change in Akt activity suggested that L-asparaginase affected p70 s6k activity independent of PI-3K. These results were similar to the previous observation in cells incubated in a medium without total amino acids (22).

Withdrawal of Asn and/or Gln from the culture media inhibited p70 s6k as did L-asparaginase, suggesting that the inhibition of p70 s6k by L-asparaginase is likely explained by enzymatic deprivation of Asn and/or Gln. Withdrawal of Gln alone was reported to inhibit p70 s6k activity only by 15-20% in CHO cells (20), and this differential sensitivity may depend on the ability to synthesize the amino acid in cells. Leukemic cells resistant to L-asparaginase are known to have an enhanced ability to synthesize Asn compared to cells sensitive to L-asparaginase (4, 7). Indeed, p70 s6k was poorly inhibited by L-asparaginase in a subclone of Jurkat of which cell growth has become resistant to L-asparaginase. Taken together, L-asparaginase likely suppresses p70 s6k activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation through decreases in Asn and Gln concentrations, especially in leukemic cells which have a reduced ability to synthesize these amino acids. Here, we further demonstrated that L-asparaginase inhibited translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins within 2 h. The translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins is selectively suppressed by rapamycin (27), and mainly regulated by activity of p70 s6k (14, 15). Taken together, L-asparaginase inhibits the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR/p70 s6k-4E-BP1 pathway. In animal models and/or clinical patients, L-asparaginase is a potent anti-leukemic agent (1­3), whereas rapamycin has a strong immunosuppressive activity (13). The common features on signaling events may lead to novel applications of L-asparaginase and rapamycin. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
