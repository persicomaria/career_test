Two DNA hairpin motifs (5¢-GCGAAGC-3¢ and 5¢-ACGA AGT-3¢), both stabilized by a 5¢-GAA loop, have been used to design novel intramolecular double hairpin structures (5¢-GCGAAGCACGAAGT-3¢ and 5¢-ACGAAGTGCG AAGC-3¢) in which coaxial stacking of the two hairpin components generates a double-stranded stem region effectively with a single-strand break in the middle of the sequence at either the TG or CA step between unconnected 3¢ and 5¢ terminal bases. We have investigated by NMR the conformation and dynamics of the DNA at the strand break site. We show that mutual stacking significantly enhances the

stability of each hairpin. Further, the anthracycline antibiotic nogalamycin binds cleanly to the 5¢-TG (5¢-CA) site formed by the mutually stacked hairpins despite the break in the sugar-phosphate backbone on one strand. The complex resembles the structure of nogalamycin­DNA complexes with the drug bound at 5¢-TG sites in intact duplex sequences, with p-stacking interactions probably the single dominant stabilizing interaction. Keywords: DNA structure; single-strand break; NMR spectroscopy; drug­DNA recognition; nogalamycin.

DNA exhibits a wide range of structural topologies (duplex, triplex, tetraplex, bulged structures and hairpin loops, to name but a few), many of which have been associated with a specific biological function and are formed in a highly sequence-dependent manner [1­5]. How these structures may be recognized or stabilized by small molecule ligands has significant bearing on the efficacy of the latter as drug molecules and their ability to interfere with the cell replication cycle. For example, some intercalators have been shown to bind more tightly to bulged structures than normal B-DNA with the possibility of perturbing the recognition of DNA defects by repair enzymes, or inducing and stabilizing a frame shift [6­9]. Similarly, DNA lesions and strand breaks are also susceptible to the influence of ligand binding with consequences for recognition by repair enzymes. Many DNA intercalators inhibit the activity of topoisomerases I and II [10,11], though it is not clear in most cases whether binding to the DNA cleavage site is involved directly in inhibiting the strand religation step in the replication cycle. While hairpin loops are a ubiquitous part of the RNA folding landscape, consisting of a single-stranded loop region closed by a base paired stem, there are fewer observations of stable DNA hairpins [12]. A number of recent papers have described the extraordinary stability of DNA hairpins containing a 5¢-GAA loop [13­18], which is able to fold back between the two As and is stabilized by a nonWatson­Crick G-A base pair forming extensive base stacking interactions within the loop region. Hirao et al. [14] have described the NMR structure of the hairpin sequence

5¢-GCGAAGC-3¢ which exhibits a remarkably high Tm ( 76 °C) for such a short sequence. A number of subsequent papers have described thermodynamic analysis [12] and structural modelling [19] of mini-hairpins with other loop sequences (5¢-GNA) to investigate the origin of the high thermal stability of the 5¢-GAA loop. We have used this DNA hairpin motif as a scaffold to design a novel intramolecular double hairpin structure with each component stabilized by a 5¢-GAA loop [ Fig. 1]. Onehalf of the structure consists of a hairpin identical to that studied by Hirao et al. [14] 5¢-GCGAAGC-3¢, whilst the other half contains an A-T base pair in the stem, 5¢-ACGAAGT-3¢. Co-axial stacking of the two hairpin structures is envisaged to generate a double-stranded stem region effectively with a single strand break in the middle of one strand [see, Fig. 1]. We have synthesized two DNA sequences (5¢-GCGAAGCACGAAGT-3¢; dHTG and 5¢-ACGAAGTGCGAAGC-3¢; dHCA) designed to fold with the single strand break (unconnected 3¢ and 5¢ terminal bases) at either the 5¢-TG step (dHTG) or 5¢-CA step (dHCA), respectively. We describe NMR studies of the double-hairpin structures dHTG and dHCA, together with the isolated single hairpin 5¢-ACGAAGT-3¢ (sH) [Fig. 1], to investigate the conformation and stability at the strand break site and its recognition by drug molecules. Nogalamycin intercalates into the DNA double helix providing one of the few examples of a drug molecule that has significant interactions in both the major and minor grooves mediated by the pendant sugar moieties [20­25]. The bulky structure of nogalamycin suggests that formation of a stable DNA intercalation complex requires a significant disruption of DNA structure involving partial melting of the double helix followed by drug association and complex formation templated by contacts with the drug molecule [26­28]. While the double hairpins described above have a high affinity binding site at the TG step appropriate for drug recognition, this site spans the single-strand break point. We

investigated whether nogalamycin is able to recognize this damage site specifically and stabilize the duplex.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample preparation Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 10-lmol scale using solid-phase methods on a commercial DNA synthesiser and purified using reverse-phase HPLC, as previously described [24]. For NMR analysis and drug titration studies, DNA sequences at 3-mM concentration in 100 mM NaCl/10 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 7) were used. Nogalamycin was a gift from the Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo. UV melting studies These were carried out on 5 lM solutions of sH, dHTG and dHCA and their complexes in 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 at pH 7.0, monitoring the change in UV absorbance at 260 nm over the temperature range 25­100 °C. Data were collected on a Pharmacia Biotech Ultraspec 2000 UV-vis spectrometer using a Peltier temperature controller employing a heating rate of 1 °CÆmin)1. NMR methodology Data were collected at 500 and 600 MHz on Bruker DRX500 and Avance 600 spectrometers. A combination of two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY, DQF-COSY and TOCSY were used for the complete assignment of the complexes using established procedures [24,29]. NOE distance restraints were derived as described previously using data at 500 MHz [24].

Structure calculations Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on a Silicon Graphics Origin 200 with R10000 processors using the SANDER module within AMBER4 and AMBER6 using the explicit TIP3P water model [30]. Parameterization of molecular fragments used a modified AMBER94 forcefield amended to include parameters for the nogalamycin drug molecule Fig. 2. The co-ordinates for nogalamycin where taken from the X-ray structure of Arora [21]. Electrostatic interactions were simulated using the particle mesh EWALD (PME) algorithm [31]. High frequency motions were removed using the SHAKE algorithm allowing a time step of 2 fs to be used [32]. The starting co-ordinates were constructed from a canonical B form DNA helix d(AGTGCG). (AGCACG) with a sheared GA pair at each end. The model was allowed to equilibrate and was subjected to restrained molecular dynamics with additional G-A hydrogen bonding restraints. The structure was then energy minimized and the loop closed by addition of the bridging adenine nucleotides using an initial backbone geometry close to that described by Hirao et al. [14]. The stem region was then nicked at the AC step and phosphate deleted to give free 3¢- and 5¢-OH groups. The structure was subjected to equilibration over 300 ps of unrestrained molecular dynamics. This structure

was energy minimized by cooling to 0 K and used in subsequent modelling. Intercalation of the drug molecule was achieved by increasing the separation of the bases at the intercalation site and by placing the drug in the orientation and position suggested by the NOE data. Further equilibration and unrestrained modelling was performed for 500 ps. Subsequently, a total of 96 NOE restraints were used with distances derived as described previously from cross-peak volume integration at a number of mixing times [24]. These included 18 Ôhigh qualityÕ drug-DNA restraints from unambiguously resolved cross-peaks. An error bound of ± 20% was applied to all restraints. All restraints were introduced gradually over 10 ps and the simulation was allowed to run for a further 500 ps with structures sampled at 10 ps intervals over the final 200 ps. The final family of 20 ° structures showed a mean pairwise rmsd of 0.74 ± 0.14 A (all heavy atoms). The fit to the experimental NOE restraints was generally good; seven restraints correspond° ing to weak experimental NOEs showed violations > 0.5 A ° but < 0.65 A. The overall RMS distance restraint violation ° was < 0.05 A. The co-ordinates of the mean structure have been deposited in the NDB under accession number: 1LOR.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Stability and folding of DNA hairpins We first examined the stability of the designed double hairpin sequences by NMR to establish that the hairpin motifs are folded. The initial NMR studies on the heptamer sequence 5¢-GCGAAGC-3¢ by Hirao et al. [14] provided some insights into features characteristic of hairpin formation. For example, the deoxyribose H4¢ of A4 undergoes a large upfield shift as a consequence of stacking interactions in the loop region. We used this shift as one of a number of indicators that the hairpins are folded. For example, the NOESY spectrum of 5¢-ACGA4AGTGCGA11AGC-3¢ (dHCA) is shown in Fig. 3, and illustrates part of the

deoxyribose spin systems for A4 and A11 showing A4H4¢ and A11H4¢ to be up-field shifted to a very similar extent by > 2 p.p.m. compared with other H4¢ signals from nucleotides in the stem regions. Further, C2H2¢ and C9H2¢ of dHCA, both of which are adjacent to the G-A pair in the loop regions, are located > 0.5 p.p.m. up-field at 1.56 and 1.57 p.p.m. in the two structures. Very similar perturbations are apparent for dHTG. Examination of the intensity of base H6/H8-H1¢ NOEs, which are weak compared with a number of calibration NOEs, suggests that all nucleotides adopt anti-glycosidic conformations, including those in the proposed G-A pair [Fig. 2]. The similarity of the shifts for the 5¢-GAA components of both dHCA and dHTG suggests that in all cases the 5¢-GAA loops are populated to similar extents, with the data in good agreement with the results of Hirao et al. [14]. Analysis of the single hairpin sequence 5¢-ACGAAGT-3¢ (sH) by NMR reveals a similar degree of formation of the 5¢-GAA loop, however, the observation of highly exchange broadened imino proton resonances for the Watson­Crick hydrogen bonded base pairs suggest that the stem region of 5¢-ACGAAGT-3¢ is not particularly stable with the G6NH only visible at low temperature (5 °C), and exchanged to baseline at 15 °C [Fig. 4]. In contrast, all four imino protons in the stem region of both dHTG and dHCA are readily resolved at 15 °C. In each case, the thymine NH at the break site shows some evidence of exchange broadening and rapidly disappears at higher temperatures though other signals persist beyond 35 °C [Fig. 4]. Detailed analysis of the NMR data for the isolated hairpin 5¢-ACGAAGT-3¢ and the same sequence within the double hairpins reveals some differences in chemical shifts of up to 0.2 p.p.m. for nucleotides involved in end-stacking. Further, in NOESY data collected at 15 °C we observe internucleotide NOEs across the break site for dHCA (A1H8«C14H1¢/C14H2¢/H2¢/C14H6) that provide unambiguous evidence for a significant population of coaxially stacked hairpins. On the opposing strand, NOEs across the

All were recorded in 90% H2O solution under identical sample conditions.

contiguous 5¢-TpG step are quantitatively entirely consistent with a normal B-DNA backbone geometry, precluding a highly dynamic disordered backbone conformation opposite the break site. The corresponding NOEs for dHTG (across the G1«T14 step and through the contiguous 5¢-CpA step) are also clearly evident, again confirming the right-handed twisted conformation along the stem region and across the break site with p-stacking interactions appearing to dictate the preferred geometry. In 2 ns of unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations on dHCA, using an explicit solvent model, we observe a highly stable structure with favourable A-T on G-C coaxial base stacking across the break site with the structure retaining the righthanded twisted conformation of B-DNA. The conformation of the 5-GAA loop is characterized by a number of features. In support of the formation of a sheared G-A pair in the hairpin loop sequence, as proposed by Hirao et al. [14], we also see a broad downfield shifted resonance at 10.7 p.p.m. [Fig. 4] with a highly temperaturedependent line width, attributed to a nonhydrogen bonded guanine imino proton from the G-A base pair [see, Fig. 2]. Together with the observation of anti-glycosidic torsion angles, this is consistent with the anti-G/anti-A sheared base pair proposed by Hirao et al. [14]. There is some evidence for conformational exchange broadening for the H1¢ resonances of nucleotides in the 5¢-GAA loops; though the origin of this effect is unclear, it suggests some conformational heterogeneity in the loop region perhaps relating to the preferred orientation of the looped adenine and its stacking with respect to the G-A pair. While the NMR data for the double hairpins are poorly resolved, particularly for residues in the loop regions, the 5¢-GAA loop of the isolated hairpin 5¢-ACGAAGT reveals a number of key features. There is an absence of internucle-

Nucleotide labels A1, C2, etc. indicate the position of the intranucleotide NOE H6/H8«H1¢. Thus, the solid lines connect sequentially neighbouring nucleotides. NOEs at the T7«G8 step are very weak due to drug intercalation at this step, although weak interactions are observed across the A1«C14 break site (peak a). There is particularly severe overlap of resonances from the purine bases, with NOEs involving A4/A11 and A5/A12 unresolved in this data (dashed boxes). On the right, NOEs from methyl to sugar H1¢ are highlighted. Key drug­DNA NOEs that identify the position and orientation of the bound intercalator at the 5¢-TG step are labelled as follows: (b) Ng­H1¢«T7H6 (c) Ng­H11«G8H1¢ (d) Ng­H11«T7H1¢ (e) Ng)9-CH3«G8H1¢ (f) Ng)3¢-CH3«G8H1¢ (g) Ng­H1¢«T7CH3 (h) Ng)9-CH3«C9H1¢, and (i) Ng)3¢-CH3«C9H1¢.

otide NOEs across the ApA step suggesting that these nucleotides are not mutually stacked. However, the corresponding interactions are observed across the GpA step indicative of favourable guanine-adenine p-stacking interactions. Figure 5A,B shows the sequential connectivities between base H8/H6 and sugar H1¢ and H2¢/H2¢ for 5¢-d(ACGAAGT); internucleotide cross-peaks are readily identified along the A1C2G3A4 and A5G6T7 portions of the sequence, but no NOEs were observed between the A4 and A5, in agreement with the results of others [12,14]. The previous NMR studies [14], coupled with extensive molecular modelling [19], have concluded that the sheared G-A base pair is a prerequisite for a stable trinucleotide loop by considerably shortening the distance between the nucleo° ° tides in the G-A pair to 7.5 A (cf. 16.4 A in a Watson­Crick base pair) allowing a single nucleotide to bridge the gap where a larger number is required in the case of a Watson­ Crick stem region [12]. Binding of nogalamycin between coaxially stacked hairpins Titrating the drug into a solution of dHCA or dHTG and monitoring the interaction by NMR, showed the emergence of a new set of DNA resonances along side those of the unbound species which disappear at a drug to DNA ratio of 1 : 1. Characteristic of nogalamycin intercalation at a 5¢-CA site is the appearance of the adenine H8 resonance in a downfield shifted position ( 8.44 p.p.m.). The free and

bound DNA signals are in slow exchange at 25 °C, as observed for binding to intact duplex DNA sequences, with the change in complexity of the NMR spectrum indicative of the formation of a single bound species. Subsequently, complete assignment of the 1 : 1 complex has enabled many drug­DNA NOEs to be identified that define unambiguously the position and orientation of the bound ligand. In the Ng­dHTG complex we do not see internucleotide NOEs across the intercalation site between G1 and T14, as observed for the free DNA, however, the drug acts as a surrogate base pair with the aromatic proton Ng­H11 giving NOEs to both G1H1¢ and T14H1¢, consistent with intercalation between the two hairpins. In the Ng­dHCA complex, we do observe weak interactions for A1H8«C14H1¢/C14H2¢/2¢ but also analogous strong NOEs from Ng­H11 to T7H1¢ and G8H1¢ [Fig. 6], showing that the bound orientation of the drug in the two complexes is identical with respect to the 5¢-TG step. The sequential connectivity pathway for dHCA (H6/H8«H1¢) is also illustrated in Fig. 6; while signals from the stem region of the complex, including nucleotides at the intercalation site, are well-resolved, the purines in the GAA loops are severely overlapped. Many key drug-DNA NOEs at the intercalation site are also evident in Fig. 6, highlighting in particular extensive hydrophobic interactions between drug methyl groups on the ring A and nogalose sugar and deoxyribose sugars in the minor groove. In the major groove, we see characteristic NOEs from Ng­H1¢ and Ng)5¢-CH3 on the bicycloaminoglucose sugar to T7 CH3. These NOEs are completely analogous to those

Ó FEBS 2002

observed for nogalamycin binding to the 5¢-TpG site in normal duplex DNA, including internucleotide NOEs across the 5¢-CA step attributed to base pair buckling [24,25]. These characteristic NOEs indicate in a qualitative sense that the drug­DNA interaction is independent of the restraining influence of the phosphodiester backbone, with the intercalation site geometry and favourable intermolecular interactions resulting largely from induced-fit by the drug. Examination of the temperature-dependence of imino proton line widths showed that the base pairs in the complex are highly stabilized by drug binding at the break site. The one-dimensional exchangeable proton spectrum for the Ng­dHTG complex (10­15 p.p.m.) is also shown in Fig. 4 at 35 °C. Interestingly, T14NH, despite the direct contact of the thymine base with the bound antibiotic, shows some evidence for exchange broadening ahead of other flanking G-C base pairs that undergo a cooperative exchange process at > 50 °C with all resonances broadening simultaneously. The Ng)6-OH at 11.8 p.p.m. also shows preferential broadening suggesting some local breathing motion perhaps facilitated by the single strand break across the TG step. Drug stabilization of the double hairpin measured by UV melting studies To investigate the effects of drug binding on the stability of the hairpin structures, we carried out UV melting studies on sH, dHTG and dHCA and the corresponding drug complexes. The melting temperatures of dHCA and dHTG were similar (66.0 °C and 65.3 °C, respectively) showing relatively broad transitions. The corresponding drug complexes showed modestly enhanced stabilities with Tms of 71.3 °C and 72.4 °C, respectively, and evidence for more co-operative transitions. The hairpin d(GCGAAGC) of Hirao et al. [14] was shown to be exceptionally stable (Tm ¼ 76 °C), however, d(ACGAAGT) with the substitution of an A-T

for the terminal G-C base pair lowers the Tm considerably to 48.5 °C. The broad transitions for dHTG and dHCA are suggestive of two unresolved melting processes corresponding to each of the individual hairpin components. However, the low temperature transition observed for d(ACGAAGT) alone is not apparent in the melting curves of the double hairpins containing this sequence, suggesting that coaxial stacking stabilizes this hairpin to some degree, consistent with the NMR melting studies. Structure of the Ng­dHCA complex The structure of the Ng­dHCA complex has been determined by NOE-restrained molecular dynamics simulations using protocols described in detail previously [24], with some modifications for the incorporation of the 5¢-GAA loops (see Materials and methods). Figure 7 shows a family of 20 overlayed structures collected at 10 ps intervals over the ° course of the MD simulation (pairwise rmsd 0.74 A), together with a single energy minimized structure (right). Consistent with the NOE data, and as observed in anthracycline­DNA complexes in general [22­26], the base pairs at the intercalation site show pronounced buckling to maximize van der Waals contacts with the drug which threads through the helix perpendicular to the long axis of the base pairs. The stem region of the duplex remains essentially B-like with the characteristic right-handed twist and partial unwinding across the intercalation site. In Fig. 8, we overlay the TG intercalation site for the Ng­dHCA complex with that determined previously for the Ng­d(ATGCAT)2 complex [24]. Apart from the break in the sugar-phosphate backbone of the former, the two are similar in terms of both the DNA geometry and the nature of the stabilizing interactions. The bicycloamino glucose sugar, which is largely polar in nature, forms specific hydrogen bonding interactions with the guanine base at the 5¢-TG intercalation site that have previously been used to rationalize the observed binding specificity for the 5¢-TpG site.

While the intercalation site is well-defined by the NOE data, relatively few restraints could be derived for the loop regions because of extensive resonance overlap from the six purines of the two 5¢-GAA loops (see data in Fig. 6). Our initial structural model of the loop was derived using the data for the single hairpin 5¢-ACGAAGT-3¢ where NMR data were considerably better resolved [Fig. 5]. Our model for the GAA loop is similar to that of Hirao et al. [14], to whom we are grateful for providing co-ordinates of the 5¢-GCGAAGC-3¢ hairpin for comparison purposes. In the complex the drug does not interact with the loop regions (Fig. 6A) so we would argue that these should be relatively unperturbed by drug intercalation. All the NMR data available suggest this is the case. The dynamic processes that lead to line broadening for a number of sugar H1¢ resonances for nucleotides in the loops also persist, perhaps to an even greater degree, in the complex. In conclusion, using intramolecular double hairpin structures where the two hairpin components coaxially stack, we have engineered a single-strand break in the phosphodiester backbone in one strand at the centre of the double-stranded stem region. There is strong evidence from NMR that the two hairpin components are mutually stacked and reasonably stable despite the single-strand ÔdamageÕ. The antibiotic nogalamycin has been shown to intercalate specifically at the site of the strand break, resulting in a highly stable complex through a combination of base sequence recognition of a B-DNA conformation and induced-fit through extensive ligand­DNA interactions. The position of the strand break on either the 5¢-TG or 5¢CA strand appears to make little difference to the ability of the drug to recognize and bind to this site, with the drug forming stabilizing interactions completely analogous to those reported in a number of previous NMR and X-ray structures with intact double-stranded B-DNA [22­26]. We can speculate that access of the drug to the intercalation site is greatly facilitated by the single strand break and that the association rate, which is slow for intact duplex DNA due to the requirement for local melting [33], may be significantly enhanced.
