Fragment TR2C is the C-terminal part of the calcium-binding protein calmodulin, including residues 78±148. The crystal structure of TR2C was solved by molecular replacement and re®ned to a conventional R value of 21.8% (Rfree = 22.0%), Ê using all data in the resolution range 20.0±1.7 A. This study shows that the secondary structure of TR2C, a pair of EF-hand motifs with two calcium-binding sites, is similar to the corresponding motifs in intact calmodulin. However, it also indicates that the N-terminus of helix E is closer to the C-terminus of helix H in TR2C than in the intact protein and that the loop connecting the EF-hands shows different conformations in the two structures. The crystal structure of TR2C was further found to be similar to the set of NMR structures of this fragment, although some pronounced differences exist.

1. Introduction
The calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), which is ubiquitous in eukaryotic systems, combines with and modulates the activity of a wide variety of enzymes (Manalan & Klee, 1984). It has a broad distribution within the cell and throughout different tissues and species (Finn et al., 1995). CaM is a small heat-stable acidic protein which consists of 148 amino-acid residues. The crystallographic structure reported for CaM (Babu et al., 1988) is far from being optimally packed and exhibits a characteristic dumbbell shape with one pair of EF-hands in each lobe. The structure is more compact in solution and the dynamics of its long connecting helix is very important in the process of enzyme activation (Persechini & Kretsinger, 1988; Zhang et al., 1995). Crystal structures of the parent protein CaM bound to, for example, TFP (Cook et al., 1994; Vandonselaar et al., 1994) show that the tertiary structure of CaM changes from an elongated dumbbell to a compact globular form. Recently, the CaM structure from Ê Paramecium tetraurelia was solved to 1.0 A resolution by Wilson & Brunger (2000). This high-resolution structure allowed a detailed analysis of the structural disorder, which indicated a high degree of functional ¯exibility in the protein. In the presence of Ca2+ ions CaM can be cleaved by trypsin, mainly after Lys77. Subsequently, two fragments TR1C (residues 1±77) and TR2C (residues 78±148) are formed. It has previously been shown that both fragments TR1C and TR2C bind calcium in a similar manner as the complete CaM molecule (Thulin et al., 1984). The two tryptic fragments are also able to bind target enzymes but not to activate them (Newton et al., 1983; Minowa et al., 1988). It has further been suggested that TR1C and TR2C show conformations similar to

Â those in the intact CaM molecule (Ikura et al., 1985; Forsen et al., 1986, 1991; Dalgarno et al., 1984). Recently, the solution structures of the apo and Ca2+ forms of the TR2C domain of CaM were solved (Finn et al., 1995; Kuboniwa et al., 1995). They have essentially equal secondary structure, but Ca2+ binding causes major rearrangements of the secondary-structure elements. Ê The previously presented crystal structure of TR2C to 3.6 A È resolution (Sjolin et al., 1990) is to be replaced by the current Ê structure to 1.7 A resolution. The availability of the crystal structure of TR2C to this higher resolution will be a complement to the previous NMR structures.

2. Experimental
2.1. Crystallization

The fragment TR2C was expressed in Escherichia coli and puri®ed as described by Finn et al. (1995). Crystals were grown by vapour diffusion employing the hanging-drop technique at room temperature. Each droplet was formed by mixing 2 ml of protein solution (88 mg mlÀ1) with 2 ml of reservoir solution consisting of 15% PEG 4000 as the precipitating agent, 40 mM sodium acetate buffer solution pH 4.6 and 70 mM CaCl2. In 2 d, octahedral crystals of approximately 1.3 Â 0.6 Â 0.6 mm were grown. The TR2C crystals used for data collection crystallized in the tetragonal space group I41, with unit-cell Ê parameters a = b = 37.8, c = 99. 8 A and Z = 1. The volume per Ê 3 DaÀ1, which corresponds to a solvent unit mass VM is 2.3 A content of 45% (Matthews, 1968).
2.2. Data collection

Ê Data were collected to 1.7 A resolution on a MAR-II imaging-plate system mounted on a Rigaku rotating-anode X-ray generator. The exposure time was 240 s for each of the 90 frames of 1 oscillation. This data set was not complete at Ê low resolution and hence it was scaled to a second 3.4 A lowresolution data set collected at BL711 at the MAX-lab II synchrotron in Lund, Sweden, also on an image-plate detector. The exposure time was only 1 s per degree. Both data sets were collected at room temperature and were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997), resulting in 7694 unique re¯ections. The overall Ê temperature factor obtained from the Wilson plot is 32.2 A2 (Wilson, 1949). The statistics of the ®nal data set are summarized in Table 1.
2.3. Structure solution and refinement

Phases for the TR2C model were obtained by the molecularreplacement technique (Lattman, 1985) using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). Residues 85±144 from the C-terminal part of Ê the 1.7 A CaM structure (Chattopadhyaya et al., 1992; referred Ê to as the 1.7 A CaM structure) were used as the search model. Ê The structure was originally solved for a 2.5 A resolution data Ê set with unit-cell parameters a = b = 37.4, c = 100.1 A (unpublished results). Residues 84±143 of this structure were Ê then used as the model for the new 1.7 A data set. Even
Acta Cryst. (2001). D57, 664±669

though the unit-cell parameters of the new crystal were close to those of the previously solved structure, it was not possible to solve the structure by simply placing the old model into the new cell. Instead, AMoRe was used again, which gave distinct Ê rotation- and translation-function peaks for 15.0±3.0 A data. The ®tting program was used to optimize the rotation angles and the translational parameters; the top peak had a correlation coef®cient of 0.82 and an R value of 30.4%. 4.7% of the data were excluded from all re®nement for calculation of a È free R value (Brunger, 1992). The model was then subjected to rigid-body re®nement using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) for data in the resolution range 15.0± Ê 2.4 A and an Rfree of 36.5% and an Rcryst of 32.1% were obtained. With subsequent positional and individual Ê temperature-factor re®nement including all data to 1.7 A and insertion of two well de®ned calcium ions the Rfree was reduced to 34.6% (Rcryst = 30.8%). The model was improved È by simulated annealing (Brunger et al., 1990) using X-PLOR È (Brunger et al., 1987), alternating cycles of manual rebuilding using the computer graphics package O (Jones et al., 1991) and maximum-likelihood re®nement with REFMAC. After insertion of the N-terminal amino acids 81±83, the C-terminal residues 144 and 145 as well as 38 water molecules, Rfree dropped to 27.5% (Rcryst = 23.5%). In an attempt to better account for the bulk solvent, the re®nement program was changed to CNS (Adams et al., 1997) while keeping the same set of test re¯ections. This altered Rfree

and Rcryst to 24.6 and 24.5%, respectively, without additional adjustments. Further re®nement with CNS combined with rebuilding using O and inclusion of two additional water molecules gave a ®nal Rfree of 22.0% and an Rcryst of 21.8%. The electron density for the N- and C-terminal residues 78±80 and 146±148, respectively, is too weak for inclusion of these residues in the model. Water molecules were inserted in the model if they showed well de®ned ' A-weighted Fo À Fc and 2Fo À Fc electron-density maps and if they could make Ê hydrogen bonds not longer than 3.2 A to other atoms. Only two water molecules are included with hydrogen bonds in the Ê range 3.4±3.5 A. All water occupancies were set to unity. Calculated composite omit maps (CNS) agree well with the model. All re¯ections with F > 0'(F) were included in the re®nement. The statistics of the re®nement results are summarized in Table 1. The average real-space correlation coef®cient (Jones et al., 1991) is 0.88 (Fig. 1). In the Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) from PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), 96.6% of all non-glycine residues lie in the most favoured regions and 3.4% (Asp93 and Asp129) are found in the additional allowed regions. These two residues are both located at the ®rst positions in the calciumbinding loops. Ê molecule. There is only one hydrogen bond less than 2.5 A within the structure, between a well de®ned water molecule Ê and Glu120 OE1 (2.4 A). No water molecules are found in the hydrophobic cleft. Ê There are 11 direct crystal contacts shorter than 3.3 A between TR2C and three different symmetry-related protein molecules. One of the interactions is with helix G from a neighbouring molecule, with hydrogen bonds between Arg90 and Glu123 and between Glu87 and Glu127. Asp93, at the ®rst position of the third calcium-binding loop, also forms a hydrogen bond to Glu123. Asp93 and Arg90 also interact with a second neighbouring symmetry molecule. Arg90 hydrogen bonds to Gly113 and Lys115, which also hydrogen bonds to Asp93. A third crystal contact, related by a crystallographic twofold axis, is particularly close and particularly involves residues Met109, Glu114 and Gln143 and their symmetry Ê mates. Glu114 OE2 is very close (1.8 A) to the symmetry-

3. Results and discussion
3.1. General structure

The secondary structure of TR2C is similar to the C-terminal half of the native CaM structure, as can be seen from the superposed plot viewed in Fig. 2. Helix E (residues 82±92), the third calcium-binding loop (according to CaM numbering) and helix F (102±111) form the third EF-hand. The fourth EF-hand is made up by helix G (118±128), the fourth calcium-binding loop and helix H (138±145). These two similar motifs are connected by a non-calcium-binding loop.
3.2. Solvent and crystal packing

All but three of the 40 identi®ed solvent molecules are in the ®rst hydration shell, making at least one hydrogen bond to the protein; 14 of these waters also bridge symmetry-related protein molecules either directly or via a second water

related Glu114 OE2. This is the closest contact in the model, but the density for this residue indicates that the two neighbouring side chains have slightly different conformations, which has not been accounted for in the model. Between these two molecules there are also hydrogen bonds between Glu114 and Glu120, and between Glu84 and Lys94.
3.3. Calcium coordination

between Asn137 OD1 and the main-chain amides of residues Glu139 and Glu140.
3.4. Hydrophobic surfaces

TR2C contains two Ca2+-binding sites and in this crystal structure both of them are occupied by a calcium ion. The calcium-binding domains have the EF-hand conformation (helix±loop±helix) typical for many calcium-binding proteins (for a review, see Kawasaki & Kretsinger, 1994). The ®rst calcium ion is coordinated to amino acids in the segment that includes residues 93±104 and the second one to amino acids in the segment including residues 129±140. Both segments are located on the surface of the molecule, with the calcium ions Ê Ê separated by 11.6 A (11.5 A in CaM). The calcium ions exhibit the same type of sevenfold coordination as in the parent CaM structure and the arrangement of the ligands can be described as a distorted pentagonal bipyramid. Typical calcium±oxygen Ê distances are found in the fragment: between 2.19 and 2.55 A Ê in the ®rst loop, and between 2.16 and 2.54 A in the second loop. These two Ca2+-binding loops form a short antiparallel -strand held together by two hydrogen bonds between Ile100 and Val136, both at the eighth position in the two loops. The -strand is also stabilized by two bridging water molecules, between Gly98 O and Tyr138 N, and between Ala102 N and Ê Gly134 O, also observed in the 1.7 A CaM structure. In the TR2C structure the side chain of Asn137 has been rotated Ê around the CBÐCG bond compared with the 1.7 A CaM structure, in order to change the positions of atoms OD1 and ND2. This change suggests well de®ned hydrogen bonds

There is a large exposed hydrophobic cleft in TR2C formed by 14 hydrophobic side chains. This cleft is in general similar to the cleft in the C-terminal half of CaM, with only minor differences between the two structures for most of the residues. One of the major changes, however, is that the side chain of Met144 extends out over the opening of the cleft instead of Ê pointing away from the cleft as in the 1.7 A CaM structure. Ê difference in the position of This gives a more than 4 A 144 CE when TR2C and CaM are superposed (Fig. 2). The two hydrophobic recognition sites for receptors in native CaM have four methionines each and the different sulfur pattern in TR2C could in¯uence the receptor binding to the fragment. A second major change is the side chain of Leu116, which is more buried in the cleft in TR2C than it is in CaM.
3.5. Comparison of TR2C with calmodulin

If the C positions of TR2C are compared with the correÊ sponding positions in the 1.7 A CaM structure the r.m.s. deviations are small (Table 2). The non-calcium-binding loop Ê has an r.m.s. deviation of 0.59 A and the remaining deviations Ê are in the range 0.12±0.29 A for separate secondary-structure elements. For the entire fragment the deviation is higher Ê (0.66 A). If the non-EF-hand turn is excluded, the r.m.s. deviation for the rest of the fragment is somewhat lower Ê (0.46 A). This means that the angles between the helices and loops are different in TR2C and CaM, giving a slightly different tertiary structure. The angle between helix E and the third calcium-binding loop differs by approximately 6 in TR2C and CaM. This brings the N-terminal part of helix E in Ê TR2C 1 A closer to the C-terminal part of helix H and TR2C becomes more compact. Since conformational changes are important for the mechanism of action for EF-handcontaining proteins, this small change or difference between the structures may re¯ect another possible conformation utilized in the activation process. Another explanation could

be attributed to crystal packing in the vicinity of the third calcium loop and helix E. The non EF-hand turn is involved in close crystal contacts in the fragment as well as in CaM, which also affects the side chains in this loop. The direction of side chain Lys115 is slightly different in the two structures, Leu116 in the hydrophobic cleft has a different conformation as already described and the double conformations reported for Ê Asp118 in the 1.7 A CaM structure are not observed in the fragment. The average atomic displacement parameter (ADP) for the Ê main-chain atoms of TR2C is 41.8 A2 (' = 10.9) and the Ê corresponding value for residues 81±145 of the 1.7 A CaM Ê Ê 2 (' = 10.0), giving a 16.5 A2 higher mean structure is 25.3 A value for TR2C. It is interesting to note that the standard deviations are about the same for the two structures. The parameters are compared in Fig. 3, which shows high values for the N- and C-termini for both structures. For TR2C the Ê ADP for the N-terminus is approximately 32 A2 higher than Ê the mean value and for CaM it is only approximately 20 A2 above the mean value. This re¯ects the higher ¯exibility of helix E after the cleavage in the central helix connecting the two lobes in CaM. Ser81 is no longer in -helical conformation and the side chains of residues 82±84 have weak electron density. This can be compared with the CaM structure of Babu et al. (1988), where residues 79±81 show signi®cant deviation from ideal -helical geometry and the ADPs in that region are among the highest in the structure. In helix E of TR2C some of the side chains (Glu82, Glu83, Arg86, Glu87 and Arg90) have signi®cantly different conformations compared with CaM. The short hydrogen bond between the side chains of Glu82 and Arg86, reported by Babu et al. (1988) and Chattopadhyaya et Ê al. (1992) as being 2.2 and 2.1 A, respectively, is completely lost in the TR2C structure. The distance between Arg86 NH1 Ê and Glu82 OE2 becomes as long as 11.2 A. For Glu87, two alternate conformations can be observed. For the C-terminus the previously determined ADP mean Ê value is exceeded by approximately 25 A2 for TR2C and by Ê approximately 32 A2 for CaM. Furthermore, in the third Ê calcium-binding loop the highest ADP for TR2C is $5 A2 Ê lower than the mean value, but for CaM it is as much as 13 A2

higher. This region is stabilized by crystal contacts in the fragment, which could in¯uence the movement of these atoms. For the non-EF-hand turn in TR2C the highest mean ADP is Ê slightly above the overall mean ($3 A2), but for CaM it is Ê 2 lower than the mean value. approximately 14 A The beginning of the fourth calcium-binding loop has similarly high deviations from the mean values for both structures, but the end of the loop is found to be more stable in the fragment than in the intact protein, with a minimum in TR2C found for Val136. Ile100 in the third calcium-binding loop has the lowest minimum in the fragment and together with Val136 it forms the short stabilizing -strand between the calcium-binding loops. Corresponding minima are not found for CaM. At the surface of the protein there are some additional side chains with major differences. Arg106 has a more relaxed conformation in TR2C than it has in CaM, where it is involved in crystal packing. Glu119 is close to symmetry-related molecules in both structures, which gives two distinct conformations. In CaM Glu139 is close to a neighbouring CaM molecule and is different in TR2C.

3.6. Comparison of the X-ray structure of TR2C with the Ca2+ NMR TR2C structures

In Fig. 4, the X-ray structure of TR2C is superposed on the Ca2+ NMR structures of TR2C (Finn et al., 1995). If only the C atoms are considered, the X-ray structure is, in general, well represented by the the family of NMR structures. Residues 90±92 at the C-terminal end of helix E, however, do not coincide at all with any of the NMR structures, although the NMR structures show low r.m.s. deviations in this area. The X-ray structures of TR2C and CaM are similar for these residues, but they both have crystal packing interactions in this area. For the backbones of the calcium-binding loops the r.m.s. deviations are small for the set of NMR structures. For the side chains the deviations are large and the arrangement of calcium ligands is not clear, since the positions of the calcium ions are not determined in the NMR structures. The crystal structure of TR2C, however, con®rms that the calcium coordination in the fragment is conserved compared with intact CaM. This is important since many experiments on binding of calcium to the fragment have been performed. For the non-EF-hand turn (residues 109±117) the X-ray structure is not close to the mean of the set of NMR structures but is partly outside. In the NMR structures there are rather few constraints and subsequently high r.m.s. deviations within the family. In the X-ray structure on the other hand, this loop is involved in crystal packing. The deviations could thus be explained by the different methods, but they may also re¯ect a property of the polypeptide chain which may in turn be Ê relevant to function. In the recent 1.0 A resolution CaM structure by Wilson & Brunger (2000) it was clearly demonstrated using TLS and multiconformer analysis that certain forms of CaM are less structurally distinct than previously
