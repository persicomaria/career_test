INTRODUCTION Histidine degradation in Agrobacterium tumefaciens involves four enzymes, including histidase (EC 4.3.1.3), urocanase (EC 4.2.1.49), imidazolonepropionase (EC 3.5.2.7), and N-formylglutamate amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.3.8). The third enzyme of the pathway, imidazolonepropionase, a 45.6 kDa protein, catalyzes conversion of imidazolone-5-propanoate to N-forminio-L-glutamate (Fig. 1). Initial studies of the role of imidazolonepropionase in histidine degradation were published in 1953.1 Subsequent publications have been limited to enzyme kinetics,2 crystallization,3 and a recently reported structure determination.4 The imidazolonepropionases are members of metallodependent-hydrolases (or amidohydrolase) superfamily, which includes ureases, adenosine deaminases, phosphotriesterases, dihydroorotases, allantoinases, hydantoinases, adenine and cytosine deaminases, imidazolonepropionases, aryldialkylphosphatases, chlorohydrolases, and formylmethanofuran dehydrogenases.5 Proteins belonging to this large group share a common three-dimensional structural motif (an eightfold a/b or TIM barrel) with similar active sites.5 Most superfamily members also share a conserved metal binding site, involving four histidine residues and one aspartic acid. Imidazolonepropionase is one of the targets selected for X-ray crystallographic structure determination by the New York Structural GenomiX Research Consortium (NYSGXRC) (Target ID: 9252b) to correlate the structure function relationship of poorly studied but important enzyme. Here we report the crystal structure of imidazo-

lonepropionase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens deter° mined at 1.87 A resolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein production

The target gene for 9252b was amplified using polymerase chain reaction from Agrobacterium tumefaciens genomic DNA using a Forward (CCAGGGAACAA TTCTGCGAAGG) and a reverse (CTGGAGAAACCT TCTGTCCCTTG) primer. The amplified gene was gel purified and cloned into BC-pSGX3 vector designed to express the protein of interest with a C-terminal hexa-histidine affinity tag. Protein expression/purification utilized previously published protocols, which are described in detail in PepcDB (www.rcsb.org).
Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination

Crystals were obtained in the monoclinic space group C2 (two molecules/asymmetric unit) via sitting drop

vapor diffusion at 208C against a reservoir solution containing 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1M Bis-Tris pH 5.5, and 0.2M MgCl2 (2 lL of protein at 30 mg/mL plus 2 lL of reservoir solution). Crystals were flash frozen by direct

immersion in liquid nitrogen following cryoprotection with 20% glycerol. Initial attempts to determine the structure using sulfur ° anomalous signal (data collected at 1.7 A) met with no success. This also happens to be the absorption edge of Fe. Interestingly, though we could locate the positions of the two iron atoms (the top two peaks), the signal was not good enough for phasing. MAD data collected near iron edge was also not successful. Crystals were, therefore, soaked in a mother liquor solution containing 2.5 mM HgCl2 for 5 min for Hg-MAD data collection. Two° wavelength MAD diffraction data collection at 2.1 A resolution was performed under standard cryogenic conditions using NSLS Beamline X12C (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory) and the data were processed using HKL2000.6 Two mercury sites with comparable occupancy were identified using

SHELXD7 and phases were refined using SHARP8 (see Table I for phasing statistics). The final experimental electron density map was of high quality allowing automated model building of $90% of the polypeptide chain with ARP/wARP.9 The final atomic model was refined using CNS10 with high resolution native diffraction data ° (1.87 A) recorded at SGX-CAT (31-ID APS; Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory). PROCHECK11 documented $90% residues in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot. Two histidine residues (His279 in both halves of the asymmetric unit) with unambiguous electron density at the C-terminus of a b-strand before a b-turn adopt disallowed (u, w) values. The final refined atomic model contains two copies of residues 17­420 plus two iron (Fe3þ) and magnesium (Mg2þ) cations, one chloride anion, and one glycerol molecule, plus 496 water molecules (Table I). Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org; PDB ID Code: 2gok). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The asymmetric unit contains two structurally similar polypeptide chains (Supplementary Material 1), with ° root-mean-square-deviation (R.M.S.D.) of 0.38 A for 404 common a-carbon atomic pairs. Each monomer is composed of two domains, a small domain [residues 17­80 and 380­420; Fig. 2(A)] and a large TIM barrel domain [residues 81­380; Fig. 2(B)].
Structural homologs

A dimer interface analysis performed using PDBSUM15 ° showed that each monomer buries 1718 A2 of solventaccessible area upon dimerization, which exceeds values typically found in interacting surfaces for a protein of this size.16 However, in the size exclusion chromatography, the protein eluted as a monomer suggesting that the dimer in the crystal may be an artifact of crystallization. At least 33 residues from each monomer are involved in dimer formation, with 12 direct hydrogen bonding interactions stabilizing the dimer.
Active site and catalysis

At the time of structure submission to the PDB, a DALI12 search revealed 16 structural homologues in the PDB with Z-score >10, all of which are members of the amidohydrolase superfamily. The closest of these is E. coli cytosine deaminase (PDB ID Code: 1k6w) with Z-score ¼ 35.3 and amino acid sequence identity of 19%. Although the R.M.S.D. between 289 common a-carbon pairs is 2.0 ° ° A, the active sites are extremely similar (R.M.S.D. ¼ 0.3 A for the five active site residues superposed; Fig. 3). Recently, the structure of imidazolonepropionase from Bacillus subtilis has been published4 (PDB ID Code: 2g3f) ° and shows a Z-score of 58.3 with an R.M.S.D. of 1.8 A between 392 common a-carbon pairs [Fig. 4(A)]. The sequence identity between these two is 42%. A multiple sequence alignment of imidazolonepropionase sequences from various organisms performed using ClustalW13 and edited using BioEdit14 shows the conservation of all active site residues (Supplementary Material 2).
Dimerization

Each active site is wholly contained within each monomer and is located within the TIM barrel domain [Fig. 2(B)]. The organization of the active site displays all of the hallmarks of amidohydrolase superfamily members,17 with a metal ion (Fe3þ), four histidine residues (86, 88, 256, and 279), and one aspartic acid (331) (Fig. 5). The iron cation (Fe3þ) is coordinated by four nearby active ° ° ° site residues (His86­2 A; His88­2.2 A; His256­2.4 A, and ° ) and a water nucleophile (X188­2.1 A) ° Asp331­2.4 A (Fig. 5). The arrangement of active site residues is very similar to that seen in E. coli cytosine deaminase (R.M.S.D. ¼ ° 0.3 A; Fig. 3). The relative positions of the metal ion and the nucleophilic water are also similar between the two structures. However, there is no conservation of substrate binding residues in two structures resulting in the different specificity of the substrates. Functionally equivalent residues involved in coordinating the metal ion and nucleophilic water between 2gok:1k6w are as follows: His86:His61, His88:His63, His256:His214, His279:His246, and Asp331:Asp313 (Fig. 3). In the presence of substrate, the Fe3þ cation can act as an electrophile to help activate the water nucleophile ° (X188) and promote substrate attack. His279 (2.9 A) and ° ) are within hydrogen bonding distance to Asp331 (3.0 A X188, where one or both of these residues could help position an activated hydroxyl nucleophile and possibly act as the general base during activation.18
Comparison of 2g3f and 2bb0

In the crystalline state, two enzyme molecules form a tightly packed homodimer (Supplementary Material 1).

2gok was the first imidazolonepropionase structure to be submitted to the PDB. However, now the structure of imdizolonepropioanse from B. subtilis is available in complex with imidazole-4-acetic acid, a substrate analogue (PDB ID Code: 2g3f), and in the presence of acetate-ion (PDB ID Code: 2bb0). Both structures have bound Zn2þ metal ion. However, in our structure Fe3þ is present at the active site that was confirmed by X-ray fluorescence analysis performed in X12C beamline at NSLS. It has been further confirmed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry analysis (Personal communication, F. Raushel).

X-ray Structure of Imidazolonepropionase

The two structures superimpose well in most of the regions [Fig. 4(A)] except between Ala96 and Lys114 (2gok numbering). To further investigate the importance of this region that is very different in three structures: 2gok, 2g3f, and 2bb0, a HINGEprot19 analysis was performed. The results of hingeprot indicate the presence of two hinge residues (Cys85 and Asp124) responsible for two possible conformation [open and closed; Fig. 4(B)] of the flap (loop with two short helix). The two confor° mations are 13 A apart from each other, considering the extreme position at Thr107 (C alpha atom) present at the tip of flap. In 2gok, the loop (Thr107, C alpha atom) ° is 4.5 and 12 A away from Thr107 of closed and open conformations, respectively, as predicted by hingeprot. Though 2bb0 is the structure of the native protein, the flap takes a closed conformation. This is probably because the acetate ion present at the active site mimics the substrate causing the flap to take a closed conformation. This possibility is further strengthened by the fact that side chain of Arg89 changes conformation in going from open to close and the terminal side chain NH2 near the hinge residue interacts strongly with the acetate

° ion (2.9 A). In view of this we propose that this region takes closed conformation when a substrate binds to the active site. 2gok, the native structure is in open conformation while both 2bb0 and 2g3f take closed conformation because of the presence of a substrate or an acetate ion [Fig. 4(A,B)].

CONCLUSIONS We have determined the crystal structure of an imidazolonepropionase. At the time of publication, this experimental structure was used as a template to compute homology models of 1300 proteins with related sequences (amino acid identity >30%) with the Modweb20 server, as there was no structure available of this protein. Given the structural similarity of the active sites of Agrobacterium tumefaciens imidazolonepropionase with E. coli cytosine deaminase, they may share the same metal-dependent catalytic mechanism.
