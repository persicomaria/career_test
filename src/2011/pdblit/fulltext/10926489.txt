Group II chaperonins close their cavity with the help of conserved, helical extensions, the so-called protrusions, which emanate from the apical or substrate-binding domains. A comparison of previously solved crystal structures of the apical domains of the thermosome from Thermoplasma acidophilum showed structural plasticity in the protrusion parts induced by extensive packing interactions. In order to assess the influence of the crystal contacts we investigated both the a and b-apical domains (a-ADT and b-ADT) in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Secondary structure assignments and 15N backbone relaxation measurements showed mostly rigid structural elements in the globular parts of the domains, but revealed intrinsic structural disorder and partial helix fraying in the protrusion regions. On the other hand, a b-turn-motif conserved in archaeal group II chaperonins might facilitate substrate recognition. Our results help us to specify the idea of the open, substrate-accepting state of the thermosome and may provide an additional jigsaw piece in understanding the mode of substrate binding of group II chaperonins.

Introduction
Chaperonins are a particular class of chaperones characterized by their multimeric toroidal architecture.1 The interior of the torus provides a folding compartment for non-native proteins, which is sequestered from the crowded cytosol and thus prevents non-productive interactions.2 The energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP drives a sequence of large conformational changes that promotes the folding process. The paradigm for chaperonin-assisted protein (re)folding has been provided by extensive structural and functional studies of GroEL from Escherichia coli.3 ­ 5 GroEL is a member of the group I chaperonins generally

found in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles of bacterial origin, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, although there is recent evidence for exceptions.34 The second, distantly related chaperonin family, referred to as group II chaperonins, comprises the chaperonins from archaea and the eukaryotic cytosol.6 ­ 8 Presumably, a homo-oligomeric ur-chaperonin diverged into the bacterial (group I) and archaeal-eukaryotic (group II) lineage. Since the sequence identity between the two groups is only 20 ­ 25%, they must have evolved independently for a long period of time, probably more than two billion years.9 ­ 11 Consequently, the two groups developed a number of distinct features: The group I chaperonins are sevenfold-symmetric double toroids and work in conjunction with a single-ring co-chaperonin (GroES), whereas the group II chaperonins form eight or nine-membered rings and function independent of a general co-chaperonin. The domain organization, however, has been conserved between the two groups: An equatorial domain that contains the ATPase site, an apical domain responsible for the recognition of non-native substrates, and an intermediate

Substrate-binding Domains of the Thermosome

other.15,19 Hence, the structure of the apical domains in solution is most relevant to the open state. In the course of the open-to-closed transition, the apical domains undergo large movements and the protrusions collectively form a lid that occludes the central cavity by the formation of a b-barrel plug (see Figure 1). This built-in lid and the iris-type mechanism of closure explain why a GroES-like cofactor is not needed in the group II chaperonins. Meanwhile, crystal structures are available for several apical domains of the thermosome and its eukaryotic homolog TriC/CCT.15,20 ­ 22 These structures display a remarkable conformational variation of the protrusions, to the extent that segments of the polypeptide chain adopt different secondary structures.21 This has been attributed, in a first instance, to crystal packing effects, but it may well reflect functionally important properties of the protrusion. Therefore, we have analysed the solution structures of the two apical domains of the T. acidophilum thermosome (a-ADT and b-ADT) and their dynamic properties by an array of NMR spectroscopic techniques.

Results
Globular part of the ADTs Conventional triple resonance experiments for backbone assignment, the indispensable prerequisite for subsequent gain of information on a per-residue basis, depend on the detection of HN protons and are consequently limited by exchange processes of amide protons with water. Under close-to-physiological conditions, the intrinsic hydrogen exchange is known to be largely dominated by a dissociative, i.e. OH2-catalysed, mechanism.23 For example, at pH 5.5 and 42 8C, the conditions chosen for a-ADT, intrinsic amide proton exchange rates kint range in the order of a few s21 and even those amide resonances of residues that are completely exposed to the solvent are not broadened excessively. These residues can still be identified, however, since the amide protons do exchange during typical mixing times used in saturation transfer and NOESY experiments. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain stable solutions of the b-ADT construct below pH 7.8 because of a strong tendency to aggregate when approaching the domain's pI value at 6.3 (the calculated pI value of a-ADT is 7.8). At this pH, values for kint of 1000 s21 and more broaden the signals of solvent-exposed amide protons to the extent that they are not observable in HSQC and the conventional HN detected triple resonance spectra. Not surprisingly, in a-ADT all 150 nonproline HN and 15N backbone resonances except for those from the three N-terminal and two C-terminal residues could be assigned, but only 110 of 148 non-proline residues in b-ADT. In the globular parts of the apical domains, the

domain connecting these two domains via flexible hinges.12 ­ 14 A functionally important difference between the two chaperonin families is found in the apical domains at the periphery of the complex. The crystal structure analysis of one (a) of the two apical domains found in the hetero-oligomeric (a,b) thermosome from Thermoplasma acidophilum ° revealed the existence of a 25 A long protrusion emerging from helix H10 of the otherwise conserved core domain.15 This protrusion is conserved among group II chaperonins, but absent from the group I chaperonins. Although there is now growing evidence that residues in the GroEL apical domain that are located deeper in the central channel participate in substrate binding,16,17 the main peptide-binding surface, hallmarked by its predominantly hydrophobic residues, has been mapped between helices H8 and H9 of the apical domain in group I chaperonins.16,18 In the group II chaperonins, the area corresponding to this major substrate binding groove is mostly hydrophilic. Rather, a large hydrophobic surface, consistent with a possible role in substrate recognition is found on the protrusions of the group II chaperonins, but hitherto there are no conclusive data as to the exact location of the binding site. In the open (substrate accepting) state of the chaperonin the protrusions are exposed at the periphery of the complex and well separated from each

measured Ha, Ca, Cb and C0 secondary chemical shifts were in excellent agreement with the expected secondary structure elements (Figure 2(A)). Even more striking was the correlation between the two (a-ADT and b-ADT) domains, yielding virtually identical chemical shifts for all conserved residues (Figure 2(B)). The well-known phenomenon, that the nuclei of structurally homologous proteins display similar secondary chemical shifts, has been exploited recently for structural predictions.24 However, we noticed some significant deviations from the diagonal in Figure 2(B) (e.g. V/I5, S/A29, S/V71, C/T78, I82, K103, V118, V/D128, V/R138, K139, F147), many of them reflecting non-conserved side-chain properties and therefore local variances in conformation. On the basis of this background we decided to proceed with a further analysis of the

secondary structure and their topology based upon 3J(HNHa) coupling constants and characteristic HN and Ha nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) only for a-ADT. Since in the globular part of the protein the outcome was mostly in agreement with the X-ray structures of the isolated apical domains (Figure 3), the data are not presented and discussed in detail, but rather summarized in the following. The protrusion will be addressed separately. As shown in Figure 4, b-strands S9, S10, the first half of S11, S17, S18 and S19 are arranged in an antiparallel b-sheet. Bulges consisting of two neighbouring hydrophilic side-chains separate S10 from S11 (K20, N/D21) and S17 from S18 (residues E133, T/R134), respectively. In contrast, the second half of S11, S14, S15 and S16 form a parallel b-sheet at the core of the apical domain. Two helices,

Strands (arrows) and helices (cylinders) are referred to following Ditzel et al.;20 S10 and S11 as well as S17 and S18 are separated by b-bulges. The dotted a-helix, which was found in the crystal structure of the isolated a-ADT, is not observed in solution.

H10 and H11, show a periodicity of f angles emphasizing their amphiphilic character, whereas H12 is embedded in the b-sandwich. Most of the secondary structure elements appear rigid, and the amide protons are well protected from the solvent. Exceptions are the first turns of H11 and H12, where residues I82 ­M85 and K103­ S104 remained unassigned in b-ADT due to the lack of H-bond acceptors for HN protons. S18 and S19 are connected by a bI-hairpin, which forms an important part of the contact interface to the intermediate domain in the whole thermosome. This loop protrudes perpendicularly from the core and proved to be highly solvent-accessible with slightly increased mobility. The conformation of the long loop following H12 (residues G114 ­L129) seems to be similar in both solution and crystals of the isolated domains. Unfortunately, we were unable to collect enough long-range NOE data to properly define the loop with respect to the rest of the fold, except for a few interactions between V118 ­T119 and S11. For these two residues, which show a rather loop-like conformation in the crystals, we

noted a tendency to form an additional short, extended stretch (termed here as S16), possibly stabilized by H-bonding to S11 (V118HN ­L26C0 and V118C0 ­ D28HN). The whole loop, which forms part of the inter-subunit interface in the closed complex, is anchored mainly by hydrophobic interactions involving as many as four leucine residues and appears remarkably rigid, although the corresponding nitrogen B-factors in the crystals of both isolated apical domains of the thermosome are increased. The protrusion region The 29 residues from I33 through F/L61 of the protrusion, which is the hallmark of the group II chaperonins, suffer most from the aforementioned assignment problems under basic conditions. Indeed, 18 out of 38 unassigned residues in b-ADT are located in the protrusion region, pointing out extreme solvent exposure. In a-ADT, all protrusion backbone amide resonances were visible, but poorly chemical-shift-dispersed,

leading to considerable signal overlap in the 15 N-heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum. Therefore, hydrogen exchange and 15N relaxation rates could not be obtained for all residues. In Figure 5, amide exchange rates of a-ADT are compared with H-bonding in the crystal structure and lack of assignment in b-ADT. As an example for the correlation between solvent exposure as predicted from H-bonding and measured hydrogen exchange, we refer to the long loop between H12 and S17: In all crystal structures, it forms a large ring, thereby leaving a hole around L26HN, which does indeed show fast exchange with the solvent as the only amide proton in S11. Although the peptide chain emerges from the globular core through E32 and I33, their amide protons seem to be protected from the solvent and are still visible at pH 7.8. This might be inferred from the vicinity of potential side-chain carboxylate H-bond acceptors for these residues. Similarly, K34, the second last residue visible in the N-terminal part of the b-ADT-protrusion, faces a completely conserved glutamate residue (E57) located on the opposite branch of the protrusion in helix H10. Residues K35 ­ Q43 form an a-helix in both crystal structures of a-ADT (PDB codes 1ASS and 1ASX), thereby protecting the amide protons of I38 ­ S45 from the solvent. In solution, however, we did not observe reduced exchange rates for those amide protons; they rather follow the calculated intrinsic rates as expected for a completely disordered peptide segment. Amide exchange remains equally fast throughout the second and third turn of the H10 helical N-cap in a-ADT crys-

tal structures, indicative of a temporary helical unwinding. Also for b-ADT, at least partial N-terminal fraying of H10 seems possible, as could be concluded from strong exchange peaks at the water frequency in the NOESY spectrum for the respective amide protons. Secondary chemical shifts, 3J(HNHa) coupling constants and sequential NOEs suggest an extended conformation for the first residues protruding from the core (E32 ­ K35). These secondary-structure indicators are in agreement with a rather weak tendency of K35 ­ Q43 to form a helix in solution. For example, the sequential HN(i) ­ HN(i þ 1) cross-relaxation rates are much smaller than those normally observed in a-helices and 3J(HNHa) are averaged to moderate values (6 ­7 Hz). The resonance frequencies of the backbone nuclei appear close to the random coil values. Even upon titration with trifluoroethanol (TFE) up to 7% (v/v), no substantial shift changes of Ha protons was observed for the respective residues in the a-ADT (data not shown). TFE is known to strongly stabilize a-helical structures in peptides and proteins, and should therefore probe the propensity of K35 ­ Q43 to form a helix in the absence of crystal-packing effects.25 Strong HN and 15N signal shifts indeed appeared in the 15N-HSQC spectrum, but they were observed also for most other solvent-exposed residues and might therefore be attributed to pure solvation effects. In summary, the occurrence of rigid secondary structure elements in this part of the protrusion seems unlikely. There is some evidence that at the tip of the protrusion residues I44 ­D46, which participate in the b-barrel in the closed thermosome, form a rather

The insensitivity of the amide groups of S48 and K49 to the concentration ofTFE suggest that these residues are protected from the solvent.

extended stretch in solution for both apical domains. This stretch is followed by three residues, S48, K49 and I50, for which the measured solvent exchange rates are lower compared to the preceding residues and similar to those observed for the start of H10. Furthermore, S48 and K49 are virtually unaffected by addition of TFE (see Figure 6), which suggests they might be involved in H-bonding. In the crystal structure of the isolated domain, K49 and I50 form part of a bI-turn capping the long helix H10. Inspecting the NOE data, summarized by strip plots in Figure 7(A), we found strong evidence that these residues are involved in a bI-turn in solution as well, induced

by P47 in the i þ 1 position and stabilized by an H-bond K49HN-D46C0 (Figure 7(B)). Furthermore, an NOE between I50HN and S48HN suggests an additional (but weaker) H-bond between I50HN and P47C0 . Thus, the hydrogen bonding pattern is consistent with a small 310 helical structure. Whereas in the closed thermosome this region indeed appears as a true 310 capping motif passing directly into the long helix H10, the isolated domains show a slightly different H-bond pattern whereby the b-turn is isolated from H10. While S48HN is not hydrogen-bonded in the crystal structure, there are hints that it is protected from the solvent in solution. As shown in Figure 6, the

resonance frequencies of S48HN remain virtually unchanged during the course of a TFE titration. Furthermore, an NOE contact between S48HN and D46Ha is clearly visible (Figure 7(B)), while contacts between S48HN and the b-protons of D46 are absent. These findings suggest the formation of a hydrogen bond between S48HN and the side-chain carboxylate group of D46, which would help to cap and thus to stabilize H10. It has to be noted that due to the difference in the chemical-shift and cross-relaxation timescales, NOE intensities are generally time-averaged and we cannot exclude the possibility that the bI-turn we observe in solution is populated only partially. For residues Q51 ­T60, corresponding to the first half of H10, the secondary structure indicators predict an a-helix as seen in the crystal structures, albeit less pronounced as in the other helices. This matches the picture drawn by hydrogen exchange of the N-terminal half of H10 undergoing a fast open ­ close transition, thereby averaging chemical shifts, coupling constants and cross-relaxation rates. Residues N59 and T60 show significantly higher amide exchange rates. These can be understood in terms of conformational variability of the tip of the protrusion, as suggested by the order parameter S2 (see below). s

N backbone relaxation

Already in early stages of our analysis, when comparing NMR spectra of the two domains, we noticed larger linewidths for b-ADT, pointing towards a higher apparent molecular mass. A possible oligomerization of the b-domain was supported by the first estimate of the molecular rotational correlation time tc as obtained from the individual 15N R2 =R1 ratios and assuming an axially symmetric diffusion tensor (Table 1). For a-ADT, the estimated tc ¼ 9:00ð^0:08Þ ns compares favourable with the correlation time of 8.9 ns calculated from rigid body hydrodynamic modelling and is therefore consistent with a monomer. The correlation time for the b-domain was calculated to be 9.2 ns, which agrees well with 8.9 ns calcuTable 1. Diffusion tensor analysis for a- and b-ADT

lated for a-ADT, but not with 13.31(^ 0.09) ns obtained for b-ADT from the experimental data. As can be seen from the x2-values, the fitting of the data could not be improved significantly by using a completely anisotropic diffusion tensor. In order to assess whether the observed oligomerization is concentration-dependent, a 1 mM b-ADT sample was diluted by a factor of approximately 3. Almost immediately after dilution several new peaks arising from fragments were identified in the 15N-HSQC, and after two days no properly folded protein could be detected. Restricted by sample lifetime, we were able to obtain only an estimate of the 15N-R2 rates averaged over the molecule. Transverse relaxation rates for a-ADT (10.3 s21), the diluted (10.6 s21) and the concentrated (16.7 s21) b-ADT sample clearly indicate a concentration-dependent, i.e. rather unspecific, oligomerization of the b-domain. Indeed, b-ADT seems to exhibit some tendency to form lower oligomeric associates under low ionic strength conditions, as detected by analytical gelfiltration. On the basis of these results, model-free analysis of 15N relaxation data was performed only for the a-domain,26,27 since no structural details about the oligomerization of b-ADT are known. During the course of the diffusion tensor optimisation, the rotational correlation time of a-ADT changed only slightly to 9.10(^ 0.03) ns. As expected, the long axis of the diffusion tensor points towards the protrusion, approximately parallel with H10. The optimised ratio of the parallel and the perpendicular component, Dk =D' ; is 1.51 ^ 0.02, compared to 1.78 for the hydrodynamic calculation. This discrepancy can be attributed to the dynamic behaviour of the protrusion, given that largeamplitude motions should alter the shape of the molecule, thus influencing Dk =D' : A plot of the squared order parameter S2 against the sequence is shown in the upper panel of Figure 8(A). Motions in the globular part of the protein are rather restricted, with an average S2 of 0.84 for the secondary structure elements. Residues with reduced S2 indicating larger amplitude flexibility

elements, the fast motion in the protrusion is rather restricted, with an average S2 of 0.74. However, the f values of S2 for residues K35 through Q43 decrease s rapidly from 0.83 to 0.23, indicating that the mobility of this region increases from the N-terminal part to the tip of the protrusion. A helix, which was observed for these residues in the crystal with virtually no drop in the B-factors, is either short-lived on the chemical shift timescale and not populated significantly or not present at all. From the tip, S2 increases again from 0.44 for s Q51 to 0.83 for T58, which is in agreement with a fraying of H10 in the first turns. The C-terminal half of H10, stabilized by interactions with H11 and the long loop between H12 and S17, behaves like a rigid secondary structure element. As depicted in Figure 9(A), extremely low S2 values s were found for A40, I44 and D46, which is reflected also in their negative heteronuclear NOE (data not shown). The motion of the tip itself is rather restricted, indicated by higher S2 values for S48 s and K49, which are located in the i þ 2 and i þ 3 positions of a bI-turn and therefore fixed by hydrogen bonds. This pattern is even more pronounced when looking at the internal correlation times (Figure 9). The values of ti decrease from the N and C-terminal residues towards the tip of the protrusion, with significantly higher ti for S48 and K49. Although a detailed motional model of the protrusion cannot be given, these data indicate a flexible protrusion with partial unwinding of the N-terminal part of H10, and the absence of the small a-helix found in the crystal structure of the isolated a-domain.

Likewise, there are significant differences between the NMR structure and the crystal structure in b-ADT, where a single, extended b-stretch was observed when packing interactions stabilized the protrusion region. As mentioned, we were not able to fully analyze the b-homolog in solution due to fast solvent exchange of the respective amide protons. However, since the protrusion region is highly conserved among the two paralogous subunits, and we cannot find any indications of ordered structure elements in this segment, we assume that in this respect, a-ADT and b-ADT secondary structures are rather similar; that is, they are disordered in solution. Significant variances between crystal and solution structures have been described. For instance, a comparison of X-ray and NMR structures of the cystein-proteinase inhibitor chicken egg cystatin revealed a remarkable difference;29 ­ 31 a highly conserved segment that is clearly a-helical in the crystalline context proved to be largely disordered in the absence of packing interactions. Intrinsic disorder and flexibility Our solution studies corroborate the notion that the apical domains of group II chaperonins are conformationally variable; the protrusion in particular shows an extraordinary degree of flexibility. Helix H10 can undergo partial unwinding in the absence of crystal contacts. This is in good agreement with studies of the crystal structure of the CCTg-apical domain.22 Here, it was observed that the thermal B-factors in H10 increased progressively from the base to the tip of the protrusion. Mobility in the N-terminal extension led to a loss of defined electron density for residues K34 ­D49. Flexibility in the CCTg-apical domain might be more pronounced than in the archaeal homologs, since the DPSK/DPSM motif forming the bI-turn is replaced here by the extremely charged sequence REED. In the a/b-ADT, the proline-induced bI turn D46-K/M49 is present in all existing crystal structures, and was found in solution as well. Interestingly, sequence alignments of group II chaperonins show that all tested archaeal but none of the eukaryotic protrusions (with the exception of CCTa) carried a motif with b-turnpropensity.10,15,32 ­ 34 Structural plasticity plays a critical role for GroEL function. Its substrate-binding groove has been shown to adopt different conformations in unliganded as well as in complexed form with various peptide ligands.18 The plasticity of the substrate-binding region is enhanced further by the mobility of the surrounding structure elements, as indicated by high B-values.12,35,36 Our NMR studies confirm the structural plasticity of the protrusion region, and suggest that the N-terminal half of the apical domains of the thermosome, and possibly of all group II chaperonins, is intrinsically disordered. There is a growing awareness that intrinsic disorder can have an

Discussion
X-ray versus NMR data The data presented here are at variance with the corresponding crystal structures in significant details. This was not expected, given the local conformational differences, particularly in the protrusion region, observed in different crystal forms of a-ADT and b-ADT, and in crystals of the whole complex in its closed state. During closure of the thermosome, the segments K35 ­ Q43 (or equivalent segments) of each subunit form two orthogonal b-stretches that contribute to the circularly closed b-sheet forming the lid. However, in the isolated a-ADT construct, the same residues showed an a-helical conformation, which was favored strongly by the formation of a four-helix bundle between symmetry-related molecules in the crystals. The arrangement of residues into a nonamphiphilic helix was obviously favored by stereochemical fitting and hydrophobic occlusion effects. In contrast, we found a rather unstructured conformation for these residues in solution, although we cannot completely exclude a small population of helical conformations forming on certain fast timescales.

important functional role, particularly in molecular recognition.37,38 Implications for substrate binding While flexibility and intrinsic disorder might facilitate interactions with a wide range of ligands, there is another remarkable feature in the protrusions: In solution, and in the isolated b-ADT crystal structure, E57 in helix H10, a completely conserved residue in all group II chaperonins, forms an intramolecular H-bond to a highly conserved lysine residue (K34) on the opposite branch of the protrusion. Thus, this contact, which is supported by further interactions in this region, contributes to a plinth-like stabilization of the otherwise extremely mobile base of the proximal protrusion part, and this may be the reason why resonances could be assigned up to K35 in b-ADT. Strikingly, previous sequence comparisons of known archaeal and eukaryotic protrusions showed that the formation of equivalent contacts is possible for all proteins examined.10,15,32 ­ 34 In the crystal structure of the closed thermosome, these residues mediate intersubunit contacts.20 Assuming that the a and b-ADT solution structures represent the structures of these domains in the open state of the thermosome, the protrusions could be oriented like antennas at the periphery of the cavity. The large, hydrophobic surface patches, which were previously found to be highly conserved among group II chaperonin protrusions,15 would be completely exposed to the surrounding medium, ready to recognize a large range of nonnative substrates and bind them by taking advantage of this structural plasticity. Additionally, the conserved bI-turn at the tip of the protrusion might assist substrate binding, since b-turns have been shown to play a major role within recognition sites.39 Several conserved residues in the apical domains of group II chaperonins have been implicated in substrate binding.11,15,22,40 ­ 42 The residues that are accessible from the inner face of the cylinder are located either in the protrusions, preceding and in the first turns of helices H11 and H12, or in the loop region connecting strands S9 and S10. They comprise hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic residues. CryoEM studies of CCT bound to its main natural substrates, actin and tubulin, suggest that the core regions participate in target binding, but the limited resolution of the EM data does not allow pinpointing them.43 ­ 46 However, CCT binds and (re)folds the "special" substrates actin and tubulin, with which it might have co-evolved,47 as phylogenetic studies suggest,11,33 and is essential for folding a broad range of other proteins.8,48 It seems very plausible that more than one substrate recognition site exists and that the residues implicated might become involved in the binding event at different stages of the folding cycle. A similar scenario has been suggested for polypeptide-binding residues in GroEL.17,49 Further biochemical and

structural studies, particularly the investigation of the natural substrate spectrum for archaeal group II chaperonins and the mode of interaction with the apical domains, will have to show which residues are involved in substrate binding for archaeal chaperonins. In that way, we will finally learn whether the function of the protrusion is simply a lid demarcating the folding chamber from the environment, or if it does, at least temporarily, play a role in recognizing partially folded and unfolded proteins.

Material and Methods
Protein preparation If not stated otherwise, reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). For the expression of 15N or 15N,13C isotopically enriched protein, E. coli BL21-CodonPluse(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) harboring the plasmid coding for either a-ADT or b-ADT were grown in Martek9-medium of the desired label (Spectra Stable Isotopes, Columbia, MD, USA) containing additional vitamins (riboflavin, niacin, thiamin, biotin, folic acid at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, ampicillin (100 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 mg/ml)). The pH was adjusted to 7.0 with phosphate buffer. Cells were grown at 30 8C to A600 of 0.7 and expression was induced by adding IPTG to 1 mM. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g and broken by using high-pressure homogenization in an Emulsiflex C5 cell disruptor (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) after adding benzonase (1 unit/ml, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and protease inhibitors (Completee mini (without EDTA), Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 4 8C for 30 minutes at 25,000 g and the supernatant was purified on a Ni-NTAaffinity-column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) at 4 8C according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Protein-containing fractions were desalted on a Sephadex G 25 column (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) and applied to a HighQ support column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at pH 8.0. In preparations of a-ADT, contaminants were retained on the column, while a-ADT was found in the flow-through. In b-ADT purifications, the desired protein bound to the column and was eluted with a gradient of NaCl at pH 8.0 (buffer A, 20 mM Tris ­ HCl; buffer B, 1 M NaCl in buffer A). For separating aggregates and oligomers from monodisperse material, protein-containing fractions were loaded onto a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) using as running buffer 25 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl with pH adjusted to 5.5 for a-ADT- and to 7.8 for b-ADT-preparations. After concentration, samples for NMR experiments contained approximately 1 mM protein. Resonance assignment and secondary structure All NMR data were collected at 42 8C on a Bruker DMX600 spectrometer, processed with the software XWINNMR (Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany) and analysed further with AURELIA (Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany). Assignment of the backbone HN, Ha, Hb, Ca, Cb, C0 and N resonances of both apical domains was achieved using a combination of

conventional triple resonance experiments and our semiautomated assignment program PASTA;50,51 details of the assignment are published elsewhere.52 Since crystal structures of both isolated apical domains were available, and since the amounts of 13C-labeled sample were limited, we have not performed a complete side-chain resonance assignment. Moreover, in both proteins the resonance assignment was affected by the low sample stability and strong signal overlap, especially in the protrusion region. For the sake of easier comparison of the two homologous apical domains a-ADT and b-ADT, we have adopted the following residue numbering: S214 and N215 of the complete a and b- subunit are in the following referred to as S1 and N1, respectively. In contrast, the secondary structure elements are termed consistently with the entire thermosome as was done by Ditzel et al.20 Ha, Ca, Cb and C0 secondary chemical shifts were analyzed by the CSI method.53 For a-ADT, we employed further secondary structure analysis based on the 3J(HNHa) coupling constants as derived from the HNHA experiment and the pattern of sequential backbone HN(i) ­ Ha(i 2 1), HN(i) ­Ha(i) and HN(i)­HN(i 2 1) NOEs from the 3D-NOESY-15N-HSQC and 3D-15NHSQC-NOESY-15N-HSQC experiments.54 ­ 56 In the NOESY experiments, mixing times of 80 ms were used. 3 J(HNHa) coupling constants were back-calculated from the backbone angle f in the crystal structures according to the Karplus relation:

and compared to the measured ones.57 Additionally, 32 inter-strand long-range NOEs and a number of helical intermediate-range NOEs provided the folding topology. A titration of a-ADT with TFE was performed in steps of 1% with successive acquisition of 1H,15N-HSQC spectra. Ha chemical shifts were measured with an HNHA experiment at 5% TFE. Strong precipitation at concentrations as low as 7% TFE prevented further titration. Weighted chemical shift changes of the amide moiety were calculated as described, and normalized on the TFE concentration.58 Amide proton exchange Amide proton exchange rates kex in a-ADT were measured by saturation transfer using the NewMEXICO experiment.59 kex was extracted by fitting an exponential decay of Ið1Þ 2 Iðtmix Þ to the measured peak intensities Iðtmix Þ; where Ið1Þ represents the intensities at infinite mixing time as measured by a reference experiment. Problems can arise due to cross-relaxation contributions from Ha protons resonating at the water frequency and adjacent serine, threonine and tyrosine OH protons, most of which are in the fast exchange regime and thus merged with the bulk water signal. The upper boundary of these effects and therefore the detection limit was estimated to be 0.5 s21. Intrinsic exchange rates kint were calculated from the primary sequence and corrected for pH and temperature according to Bai et al.60 Additionally, for both proteins, fast hydrogen exchange of amide protons still visible in the HSQC spectra was confirmed by positive cross-peaks in the v1-plane at the water frequency of the 3D-NOESY-15N-HSQC experiment. Cross-relaxation with surface water has been shown to give rise to negative peaks due to its generally sub-nanosecond residence time.61

15 N relaxation measurements (R1, R2, 15N{1H} heteronuclear NOE) were performed at 42 8C and 600 MHz (14.1 T) for 1 mM 15N labeled fresh protein samples. Twelve different mixing times were recorded for both R1 and R2 experiments. The pulse schemes used were fully interleaved modifications of experiments described earlier.62 The same pulse sequences were utilized for a rapid comparison of mean R1 and R2 rates in a highly labile diluted (0.3 mM) sample of b-ADT. In this case, only the first serial FID for each mixing time was recorded. Relaxation rates were fitted to peak intensities using the DFIT module of DASHA3.47.63 A first initial guess of the molecular rotational diffusion tensor was obtained from the R2 =R1 ratios of individual residues using the programs R2R1_TM (A. G. Palmer, Columbia University) and QUADRIC_DIFFUSION (A. G. Palmer, Columbia University) and PDB coordinate files 1ASS and 1 E0R for a and b-ADT, respectively. Highly mobile residues or residues with relaxation contributions from chemical exchange were excluded from the estimation. Model-free analysis of the relaxation data of the a-domain was performed with Modelfree 4.1 (A. G. Palmer, Columbia University) interfaced with FastModelfree.64 Fast-Modelfree automatically performs the rigorous statistical testing protocol for the assignment of the model function for each individual residue.28 Rigid body hydrodynamic modelling of the diffusion tensor and relaxation rates was performed with the program HYDRONMR using the coordinates from the PDB data bank (1ASS and 1E0R) and an atomic bead radius of ° 4.4 A.65
