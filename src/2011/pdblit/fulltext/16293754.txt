Structure of the Quaternary Complex of Interleukin-2 with Its a, b, and gc Receptors
Xinquan Wang,* Mathias Rickert,* K. Christopher Garcia.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that acts through a quaternary receptor signaling complex containing alpha (IL-2Ra), beta (IL-2Rb), and common gamma chain (gc) receptors. In the structure of the quaternary ectodomain complex as visualized at a resolution of 2.3 angstroms, the binding of IL-2Ra to IL-2 stabilizes a secondary binding site for presentation to IL-2Rb. gc is then recruited to the composite surface formed by the IL-2/IL-2Rb complex. Consistent with its role as a shared receptor for IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, gc forms degenerate contacts with IL-2. The structure of gc provides a rationale for loss-of-function mutations found in patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency diseases (X-SCID). This complex structure provides a framework for other gc-dependent cytokine-receptor interactions and for the engineering of improved IL-2 therapeutics. The cytokine IL-2 is mainly produced by antigen-activated T cells and promotes the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of mature T and B cells as well as the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells in the innate immune defense (1, 2). IL-2 is used therapeutically as an immune adjuvant in certain types of lymphoproliferative diseases and cancers, and IL-2 antagonists can prevent organ transplant rejection (3, 4). However, severe dose-limiting toxicity has limited its effectiveness in the clinic. These deleterious side effects are mediated through different combinations of IL-2 receptors, which suggests that structurebased engineering of receptor-selective variants could have clinical benefit (5). IL-2 exerts its pleiotropic activities through binding to different receptor complexes, depending on which of the components are expressed on the cell surface: the alpha chain (IL-2Ra), beta chain (IL-2Rb), and common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gc) (6­10). Isolated IL-2Ra has been termed the Blowaffinity[ IL-2 receptor (binding affinity Kd , 10 nM) and is not involved in signal transduction (11). A complex of IL-2Rb and gc binds with intermediate affinity (Kd , 1 nM) and is the receptor form on NK cells, macrophages, and resting T cells (2), although IL-2Rb alone has very low affinity (Kd , 100 nM) and gc alone has no detectable binding affinity for IL-2 (12). The association of IL-2Rb and gc in the presence of IL-2 is necessary and sufficient for effective signal transduction through

the heterodimerization of their cytoplasmic domains and subsequent kinase activation of multiple signaling pathways (13, 14). A complex with three subunits--IL-2Ra, IL-2b, and gc--binds with high affinity (Kd , 10 pM) and is the receptor form on activated T cells (10). The high-affinity receptor complex mediates most biological effects of IL-2 in vivo (2). Whereas IL-2Ra is a specific receptor for IL-2, IL-2Rb is also a component of the IL-15 receptor and gc is shared by cytokines IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 (15). Mutations in gc can abolish the activity of all gcdependent cytokines and result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency diseases (X-SCID), in which the T and NK cells are absent or profoundly reduced in number (16). Because the six gc-dependent cytokines have low sequence homology, structural information will be helpful to delineate shared versus ligand-specific binding determinants that could be exploited therapeutically. Previously, we reported the structure of the binary complex of IL-2 with IL-2Ra (17). We now present the crystal structure, at 2.3 ) resolution, of the quaternary complex of IL-2 with the extracellular domains of receptors IL-2Ra, IL-2Rb, and gc. Overall structure. Because of the heterogeneity of the fully glycosylated proteins expressed from insect cells, we crystallized a glycan-minimized quaternary complex, which had five potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites mutated (18). This material behaved identically to the fully glycosylated proteins and yielded crystals that diffracted to 2.3 ) resolution (18). The quaternary complex is composed of one copy each of IL-2, IL-2Ra, IL-2Rb, and gc (Fig. 1A). The orientation of IL-2Ra explains the necessity for the long connecting SCIENCE VOL 310

peptide, disordered in the structure, between the IL-2Ra globular head and the transmembrane segment. This allows the IL-2Ra binding domain to extend away from the cell surface and reach the dorsally located binding site on IL-2 (Fig. 1B). The bases of the receptors IL-2Rb and gc, both class I­type cytokine receptors, converge to form a Y shape and IL-2 binds in the fork (Fig. 1, A and B). Formation of the quaternary complex is mediated by four binding sites--IL-2/ IL-2Ra, IL-2/IL-2Rb, IL-2/gc, and IL-2Rb/ gc--burying a total of 5700 )2 of surface area (fig. S1). The IL-2/IL-2Ra and IL-2/IL-2Rb contacts are independent, whereas IL-2 and IL-2Rb form a composite interface with gc, reflecting the cooperative nature of complex assembly. IL-2Ra has been shown to deviate from typical cytokine receptor structure and mode of interaction with IL-2 (17). It is composed of two domain-swapped ``sushi'' modules, essentially miniature b-sheet sandwich domains. IL-2Rb and gc are prototypical members of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily (19). Both are composed of N- and C-terminal fibronectin-III domains (D1 and D2, respectively), which are characterized by a b-sandwich sheet consisting of seven antiparallel strands arranged in a three-on-four topology. In IL-2Rb, the D1 and D2 domains are connected by a helical linker and are bent at È90-, whereas in gc the D1 and D2 domains are bent at È120- (Fig. 1A). Both IL-2Rb and gc contain the two disulfide bonds in the N-terminal domain (D1) and a ``WSXWS'' motif (20) in the C-terminal domain (D2) that are characteristic of class I cytokine receptors (19). However, a third disulfide bond in the gc D2 domain is unusual because of its central position in the interface with IL-2 and its role in enabling degenerate cytokine recognition (Cys160 to Cys209) (discussed below). IL-2/IL-2Ra. In the ``low-affinity'' complex, the atomic interactions between IL-2 and IL-2Ra, now visualized at 2.3 ), are unchanged from the binary complex at 2.8 ) (17). The binding interface between IL-2 and IL-2Ra in the quaternary complex is composed of helices A¶ and B¶ and part of the AB loop in IL-2 and strands G, C, and D in the D1 domain and strand A in the D2 domain in IL-2Ra (table S2A). The two prominent hydrophobic ridges around residues Phe42 and Tyr 45 of IL-2 insert into grooves between the IL-2Ra beta strands. Superposition of the two IL-2Ra structures in the binary and quaternary complexes shows a significant shift in the D2 domain of IL-2Ra (È2 )), which is most likely a result of crystal packing and reflects some flexibility in the D1-D2 junction. IL-15 is the only other cytokine that uses an atypical sushi-domain alpha receptor (IL-

15Ra), which is expressed primarily on NK cells (21). However, IL-15Ra is only a single sushi domain analogous to the IL-2Ra D1 domain (22, 23). By analogy with IL-2, the IL-15/IL-15Ra complex likely forms first, followed by binding to IL-2Rb and gc to form the quaternary signaling complex. IL-2Ra does not appear to make any contact with either IL-2Rb or gc. This is rather surprising, given that the IL-2/IL-2Ra complex binds with much higher affinity to IL-2Rb (Kd , 30 pM) than does IL-2 binding to IL-2Rb alone (Kd , 100 nM) (12, 24) and the on-rate of IL-2 for IL-2Rb is faster in the presence of IL-2Ra by a factor of 3 to 20 (11, 25). We see no evidence of a composite receptor binding surface for IL-2, so what is the basis of the cooperativity? One possibility would be simple entropy reduction, wherein IL-2Ra captures and concentrates free IL-2 at the cell surface for presentation to IL-2Rb and gc. Another possibility would be an IL2Ra­induced conformational change in IL-2 that stabilizes the formation of the ternary complex. To address the latter mechanism, we compared IL-2 structures in the quaternary complex, binary complex, and unbound states. The root mean square deviations for Ca atoms in the helical core between the different IL-2 molecules indicate nearly identical structures, ranging from 0.29 ) to 0.57 ). One notable exception is at the beginning of helix C of IL-2, where, in the

binary and quaternary complexes, several turns of helix C are slightly unwound and translated forward by È1.0 ) toward IL-2Rb (Fig. 2A). This local conformational adjustment moves IL-2 residue Asn88 into hydrogenbonding distance to IL-2Rb residue Arg42 (Fig. 2B). This movement possibly ``primes'' the next step in complex assembly by forming a more complementary IL-2Rb binding site. Consistent with this, mutation of Asn88 in IL-2 ablates binding to IL-2Rb (5). IL-2Ra may stabilize a favorable IL-2Rb­binding conformation of IL-2 helix C, reducing a conformational entropy penalty that would be incurred during binding to IL-2Rb. This priming of a ``quiescent'' IL-2Rb binding site in IL-2 by IL-2Ra could effectively increase the on-rate for the IL-2 interaction with IL-2Rb, as has been observed. IL-2/IL-2Rb. The interface between IL-2 and IL-2Rb buries È1350 )2 formed by residues from helices A and C in IL-2 and residues from loops CC¶1, EF1, BC2, and FG2 in IL-2Rb (table S2B). The interface is highly polar, with eight hydrogen bonds directly between IL-2 and IL-2Rb residues. Strikingly, there are seven water molecules buried in the interface that bridge interactions between IL-2 and IL-2Rb by forming bonds with protein atoms (Fig. 3A) (table S2B). Solvent exchange with the layer of water molecules between IL-2Rb and IL-2 could explain the fast on- and off-rates and the weak affinity of the IL-2/IL-2Rb binary complex. SCIENCE

Two residues of IL-2 that have been shown by mutagenesis to be critical for IL-2Rb binding, Asp20 and Asn88, are involved in hydrogen bonding networks to both water molecules and side chains on IL-2Rb (Fig. 3A). The side chains of IL-2Rb residues His133 and Tyr134 insert into a complementary cavity in IL-2 to form hydrogen and ionic bonds with Asp20 of IL-2 (Fig. 3B). IL-2Rb is also used by IL-15 to form a quaternary complex along with IL-15Ra and gc (15). IL-15 has limited sequence identity (19%) with IL-2, so its contact with IL-2Rb is probably through a unique set of interactions. The bridging water molecules may contribute to the ability of IL-2Rb to cross-react by accommodating the different IL-15 residues through remodeling of the intervening solvent layer. IL-2/gc. Neither IL-2 nor IL-2Rb alone have measurable affinities for gc (12). Therefore, two very weak interactions, IL-2/gc and IL-2Rb/gc, combine to produce an intermediateaffinity IL-2/IL-2Rb/gc complex. In the quaternary complex structure, the interaction surface of the IL-2/Rab complex with gc is composed of two interfaces: a small one between IL-2 and gc, and a larger one between IL-2Rb and gc. The IL-2/gc interface buries È970 )2 of surface area and is the smallest of the four protein-protein interfaces in the complex. The gc binding surface is striking in its absence of extended side chain­specific interactions with

IL-2 and in the preponderance of main-chain contacts. Although there are several apparent ``hotspots,'' the gc binding surface is remarkable in its flatness and almost tangential contact with IL-2 (Fig. 4A). The gc structure contains an unusual disulfide bond in the heart of the interface with IL-2 that connects loops FG2 with BC2 and supports the conformations of Ser207 to Pro211 that form direct contacts with IL-2 (Fig. 4A). The disulfide also contributes to the apparent rigidity of the cytokine-binding surface, which is surprising given that one prevailing assumption for receptor cross-reactivity is structural plasticity (26). The gc binding surface does not appear to contain mobile structural elements, although we do not have a structure of the unliganded receptor for comparison. The overall interface involves residues from helices A and D in IL-2 and residues from loops CC¶1, EF1, BC2, FG2, and the linker between strands G1 and A2 in gc (table S2C). In contrast to the broad array of specific polar interactions between IL-2 and IL-2Rb, small contact patches dominate the IL-2/gc interface. The first one is composed of residue Tyr103 from gc and residues Ser127

and Ser130 from IL-2. The Tyr103 aromatic ring packs flat against the side chains of Ser127 and Ser130 in IL-2 (Fig. 4, A and B). The second is around residue Gln126 in IL-2, which has been shown by mutagenesis to be a critical energetic hotspot. Similar to Tyr103, the side chain of Gln126 is almost parallel to the surface formed by main-chain atoms of residues Pro207 to Ser211 in gc, and this orientation is further fixed by two hydrogen bonds with the receptor, to Pro207 O and Ser211 OG (Fig. 4A). A single bridged water molecule in the IL-2/gc interface forms hydrogen bonds with Gln126 of IL-2 and with Gln127 and Asn128 of gc, respectively (table S2C). Previous mutagenesis studies have found that two of the flat gc patches we see in the structure that are involved in binding IL-2-- residue Tyr103 and residues from Leu208 to Ser211 in gc--are also important for binding IL-4, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 (27­29). There is also evidence that gc binding sites for different cytokines overlap but are not identical (30). We propose that these two patches form the central degenerate recognition surfaces that participate in binding all cytokines in the gc-dependent family by using SCIENCE VOL 310

their flat surfaces, and that the peripheral polar interactions modulate specificity for individual cytokines. IL-2Rb/gc. The second part of the composite interface between IL-2/Rb and gc is formed by extensive interactions between the D2 domains of IL-2Rb and gc, burying more than 1750 )2 of surface area (Fig. 5A). The D2 domains from IL-2Rb and gc are related by almost exact two-fold symmetry, and the interface is formed by 21 residues from IL-2Rb and 19 residues from gc from strands C2, C¶2, and E2 and loop C¶E2 (table S2D). The interface is highly polar, with a peripheral ring of 17 hydrogen bonds surrounding a hydrophobic stripe in the center dominated by Trp166 from IL-2Rb and Tyr167 from gc (Fig. 5B) (table S2D). The D2-D2 interaction between IL-2Rb and gc is the largest buried surface seen so far in cytokine-receptor complexes, and it underscores the role of receptor-receptor contact in the cooperative assembly of the quaternary complex. Although it is surprising that IL-2Rb and gc have no measurable affinity toward one another given this extensive contact surface, a lack of interaction would prevent the receptors from heterodi-

merizing and signaling in the absence of cytokine. Given the structural observations of a small IL-2/gc interface and a large and tightly packed IL-2Rb/gc interface, we suggest that the receptor-receptor (i.e., D2D2) contact may serve as an important energetic determinant. If so, the role of the cytokine would be to stabilize complex formation by guiding a perfect geometrical alignment of the numerous interatomic contacts (hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, etc.) in the D2-D2 interface. In this respect, considering the relatively flat and chemically inert IL-2/gc interface, it may be that specificity is largely provided by receptorreceptor contact with IL-2Rb rather than cytokine. This model can in part be rationalized by the ``shared'' function of gc. gc is expressed on most immune cell types, but the tissue and cytokine specificity are regulated by the coordinate expression of different a receptors (or, in the case of IL-2, the b receptor). Given the lack of sequence homology between gc-dependent cytokines, the capacity of gc to discriminate among (and to crossreact with) these ligands would be more easily achieved by spreading the energetics of the interaction over the combined È2600 )2 of surface area presented by the IL-2/IL2Rb composite surface, rather than focusing it all on the small portion of this surface contributed by cytokine alone (È970 )2). By comparison, in the structures of more ligandspecific cytokine receptors such as human growth hormone receptor (hGHbp) and erythropoietin receptor (epoR) complexed with their ligands, there is much less receptorreceptor contact (È900 )2 for hGHbp, no contact for epoR) (31, 32). X-SCID mutations. X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a syndrome of profoundly impaired cellular and humoral immunity caused by mutations in the gene encoding the common gamma chain (33). The mutated gene results in faulty signaling through several cytokine receptors;

thus, T, B, and NK cells can be affected by a single mutation. We mapped extracellular gc mutations that have been found in X-SCID patients in which gc is expressed but is not competent for activation by any of the gc cytokines. Many mutations appear to concentrate near the gc cytokine-binding site, and several of these--Y103N, Y103C, L208P, C209R, C209Y, G210R, G210V, and C160R (20, 33)--map to the gc binding interface with IL-2 (Fig. 6A). Mutation of Cys209 or Cys160, which participate in the disulfide bond in the gc cytokine-binding surface, would be particularly destabilizing. The interface mutations would effectively ablate cytokine recognition by gc, but it seems likely that the receptor would still appear to be competent to signal if heterodimerized. Although the database X-SCID mutations map to all other parts of the gc structure, none of the X-SCID mutations map to the IL-2Rb/gc interface, possibly implying a structural necessity for this area to be preserved in the expressed receptor (Fig. 6B). Degenerate cytokine recognition by gc . The gc-dependent cytokines have, SCIENCE

on average, 19% sequence identity to one another, with most of the homology concentrated inside the helical cores. Although we currently know the structures of only IL-2 and IL-4 in the gc-dependent cytokine family, we sought to identify conserved residues that might serve as a recognition code for gc binding throughout the family. Sequence alignment between IL-2 and other gc -dependent cytokines (fig. S3) indicates that residue Gln 126 , which plays a key structural role in IL-2 interactions with gc, is conserved in IL-2, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, whereas IL-4 and IL-7 have Arg121 and Lys139 in this position, respectively. Superposition of the IL-4/IL-4Ra complex (34) with the IL-2 quaternary complex indicates that Arg121 may play a structural role similar to that of Gln126 in IL-2 in contacting gc. Although position 126 in helix D may serve as a common contact point with gc, there are not obvious constellations of conserved residues that allow us to dock the different cytokines with gc. It appears that each cytokine uses distinct structural solutions for gc recognition.

Cytokine recognition by shared receptors. The flat and apparently rigid surface in the common binding epitope of gc suggests that it uses somewhat chemically inert complementary surfaces to interact with divergent cytokine residues. Although this contrasts with notions of receptor promiscuity through binding site flexibility (26), it parallels structural results for gp130, the shared cytokine receptor for long-chain cytokines (35), in complex with three different cytokines: LIF, viral IL-6, and human IL-6 (36­38). In the gp130 system, thermodynamic compensation between rigid surfaces, rather than conformational change, enables cross-reactivity with a broad range of chemically diverse cytokine surfaces (35). We predict, on the basis of direct thermodynamic measurements of the quaternary complex assembly (12), that gc also uses such a mechanism for cross-reactivity. Such a large range of energetic compensation appears to be a property of binding sites found in shared receptors, which are tuned for degenerate recognition through a mechanism that bypasses the entropic penalty for conformational change (39). Therapeutic implications. A recombinant human IL-2 (rIL-2) analog (Aldesleukin, Proleukin, Chiron Inc., Emeryville, CA) is currently licensed in the United States for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma and is undergoing clinical trials for patients with HIV/AIDS (40, 41). Treatment of cancer patients with rIL-2 results in robust responses but is associated with life-threatening toxicity, which limits its use (40). The antitumor efficacy of rIL-2 therapy has been shown to be mediated by

the high-affinity quaternary complex containing IL-2Rabg expressed on T cells, whereas the toxic side effects are mediated through the IL-2Rbg form of the receptor on NK cells (42). This hypothesis suggests that it might be possible to dissociate efficacy and toxicity by generating an IL-2 variant with selectivity for the IL-2Rabg receptor complex, versus the IL-2Rbg complex of NK cells (5). Proof-ofconcept was demonstrated with an IL-2 variant bearing an Asn88 Y Arg mutation that conferred a factor of 3000 selectivity increase for the IL-2Rabg complex by crippling the interaction between IL-2 and IL-2Rb (5). In the structure we see that Asn88 is the side chain brought into hydrogen-bonding distance to IL-2Rb by the structural perturbation of helix C in response to IL-2Ra binding, and is involved in an extensive hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 3A). Such an energetically critical residue may not be the most desirable choice for generating a receptor-selective IL-2, because it may not be necessary to completely ablate binding to the IL-2Rbg receptors. Rather, weakening the IL-2Rb interaction, or even contact with gc, while maintaining near wild-type affinity for the IL-2Rabg complex appears tenable through structure-guided engineering. It is our hope that this quaternary complex structure can be used to design IL-2 variants that will allow its powerful clinical potential to be more fully realized.
