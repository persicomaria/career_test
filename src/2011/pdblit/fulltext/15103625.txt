NrdH-Redoxin of Corynebacterium ammoniagenes Forms a Domain-Swapped Dimer
Matthias Stehr and Ylva Lindqvist* Division of Molecular Structural Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden

ABSTRACT NrdH-redoxins constitute a family of small redox proteins, which contain a conserved CXXC sequence motif, and are characterized by a glutaredoxin-like amino acid sequence but a thioredoxin-like activity profile. Here we report the structure of Corynebacterium ammoniagenes NrdH at 2.7 Å resolution, determined by molecular replacement using E. coli NrdH as model. The structure is the first example of a domain-swapped dimer from the thioredoxin family. The domain-swapped structure is formed by an inter-chain two-stranded antiparallel -sheet and is stabilized by electrostatic interactions at the dimer interface. Size exclusion chromatography, and MALDI-ESI experiments revealed however, that the protein exists as a monomer in solution. Similar to E. coli NrdH-redoxin and thioredoxin, C. ammoniagenes NrdH-redoxin has a wide hydrophobic pocket at the surface that could be involved in binding to thioredoxin reductase. However, the loop between 2 and 3, which is complementary to a crevice in the reductase in the thioredoxin­thioredoxin reductase complex, is the hinge for formation of the swapped dimer in C. ammoniagenes NrdH-redoxin. C. ammoniagenes NrdH-redoxin has the highly conserved sequence motif W61-S-G-F-R-P-[DE]67 which is unique to the NrdH-redoxins and which determines the orientation of helix 3. An extended hydrogen-bond network, similar to that in E. coli NrdH-redoxin, determines the conformation of the loop formed by the conserved motif. Proteins 2004;55:613­ 619.

ammoniagenes.5 Under microaerophilic conditions, type Ib RNR in combination with NrdH is a much more efficient enzyme than type Ia RNR (NrdAB). It has been suggested that the NrdEF-NrdH system may be the evolutionary oldest RNR reducing system, capable to function in a microaerophilic environment, where no glutathione was yet available.6 NrdH-redoxins are small proteins (9 ­10 kDa) exhibiting sequence identities in the range of 34 ­99%, and are homologous to glutaredoxins. For instance, C. ammoniagenes NrdH has 41% sequence identity to E. coli NrdH and 18% identity to glutaredoxin 3. Characteristics of NrdH-redoxins are the common fold and a conserved active site motif C-V-Q-C or C-M-Q-C that contains the redox-active cysteine residues. The pattern of residues linking the two cysteine-residues is thus different from thioredoxins and glutaredoxins, -C-G-P-C- for thioredoxin and -C-P-Y-C- for most glutaredoxins.7­9 NrdHredoxins also contain a highly conserved sequence motif [WF]-S-G-F-[RQ]-P-[DE] that is unique for this class.6 The motif is part of a loop that connects strand 3 to helix 3, and is stabilized by an extensive hydrogen-bond network. These redoxins are structurally most similar to glutaredoxins, which are specifically reduced by glutathione (GSH), although NrdH-redoxins, like thioredoxins, depend on thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) for reduction. E. coli NrdH contains a deep hydrophobic pocket at the surface, similar to that observed in thioredoxin, and modelling studies6 suggest that E. coli NrdH binds to TrxR in a similar way as thioredoxin in the Trx­TrxR complex.10 We have solved the crystal structure of C. ammoniagenes NrdH to 2.7 Å by molecular replacement, using the

E. coli NrdH structure6 as a search model. The crystal structure reveals an unexpected three-dimensional domainswapping. This is the first time that a domain-swapped form of a protein from the thioredoxin-family is reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation The vector containing the gene for C. ammoniagenes NrdH (GenBank Accession Nr. Y09572)11 was transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (Stratagene) and the cells were grown as described.2 Frozen cells were suspended in 10 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and disrupted by sonication. The cleared raw extract was dialyzed overnight against 20 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 9.5, and applied to a XK 26/20 column packed with 70 ml DEAE cellulose (Pharmacia), equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with 650 ml 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The NrdH containing fractions were pooled and applied to a XK 26/20 column packed with G50 resin (Pharmacia), equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0. NrdH containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 9.5 and applied to a Poros 20 HQ column (5 ml), (Applied Biosystems), equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The protein was eluted by a NaCl gradient. NrdH containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using a 3 K concentrator (Amicon) after the addition of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol. The protein was stored at 20°C. The yield was 80 mg pure NrdH protein from 6 g of cells. Protein Analysis The homogeneity of the purified protein was analysed with SDS gel electrophoresis.12 The protein concentration was determined with Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). The identity of C. ammoniagenes NrdH was confirmed by mass spectrometry at the Protein Analysis Centre, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. Size Exclusion Chromatography Molecular weight determination was performed by size exclusion chromatography on a FPLC-Superdex column (Pharmacia) at several different pH-values with the following buffers: 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 200 mM NaCl, pH 5.0; 20 mM Sodium phosphate buffer 125 mM NaCl, pH 6.0; 20 mM Tris/HCl, 200 mM NaCl, with addition of 1.) 1 mM DTT, 2.) 0.1% octyl D-glucopyranoside; 50 mM Bis/Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% octyl -Dglucopyranoside, pH 9.0; 50 mM Tris/HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.2. The column was calibrated with HSA (67 kDa), albumin (45 kDa), myoglobin (17.6 kDa), ribonuclease (13.1 kDa) E. coli NrdH (9.1 kDa) and vitamin B12 (1.3 kDa). For each molecular weight determination 100 l of protein (0.5 mg/ml) were used. Reduction of Insulin Disulphides The experiments were carried out as described by Holmgren et al., 197912 and Jordan et al., 1997,2 with

slight modifications. The reaction was followed as the increase in absorbance at 600 nm due to the precipitation of insulin when reduced to A and B chains. Crystallization and Data Collection Crystals of C. ammoniagenes NrdH were obtained by vapor diffusion. The protein solution was dialyzed against 0.05 M CHES-buffer, pH 9.14 and concentrated to 25 mg/ml. Three (3) l of protein solution was mixed with 3 l mother liquor (1.28 M Na-citrate, 88 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.86, 4.4 % MPD) and 1 l 0.34 mM spermidine. Hanging drops were equilibrated against the mother liquor at 20°C and hexagonal crystals, up to 1 mm in length and 0.2 mm in diameter, were obtained after 1­2 weeks. A native diffraction data set was collected at 100K on a Rigaku rotating anode with a MAR Research imaging plate. Before transfer into the nitrogen gas stream, the crystals were soaked for a few seconds in a solution of 69.3 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 1.0 M Na-citrate, 17.3% glycerol, 0.045 M spermidine, 3.5% MPD. The data were integrated with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK13 and further processing was done within the CCP4 suite of programs14 (Table I). The crystals belong to space group P63 with cell dimensions of a 89.64 Å, b 89.64 Å, c 40.15 Å and contain two molecules per asymmetric unit. Phasing, Model-Building, and Refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE15 with the NrdH-redoxin from E. coli6 (PDB accession: 1H75) as search model. Refinement was performed with the use of the CNS program package.16 This refinement consisted of anisotropic scaling, bulk-solvent correction, simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization and isotropic B-factor refine-

ment against the maximum likelihood target. Tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were used whenever possible to improve the data to parameter ratio. After some rounds of refinement it was realized that the structure was wrong around residue 49. Calculation of a simulated annealing omit-map showed clearly that the error was due to domain-swapping at this point. After re-building the chain and continuing refinement the Rfactors dropped and the maps looked excellent also in this area. The values for Rcryst and Rfree after refinement were 24.3% and 28.7%, respectively, with the test set used for Rfree calculation containing 4.6% of the reflections. Model geometry was analyzed with PROCHECK.17 Further details of the refinement statistics are given in Table I. In all figures the A-chain of the "open" monomer (domainswapped)18,19 is marked with an asterisk (*). We use a model of "closed" (unswapped) monomeric C. ammoniagenes NrdH for all structure comparisons. This model was constructed by simply reconnecting the chains of the domain-swapped dimer at residue 49 and performing some energy minimization. Minimal structural perturbations are introduced except at the swap site. Structure comparisons and structure alignments were carried out with the programs TOP and MAPS using default parameters.20,21 Figures were produced using the programs MolMol,22 O,23 Molscript24 and Raster3D.25 The coordinates and structure factors have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank, accession code 1R7H. RESULTS Protein Characteristics and Functional assay C. ammoniagenes NrdH was expressed as soluble, active and monomeric protein in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus. The

molecular weight of the protein obtained by MALDI-ESI was 8.15 kDa in excellent agreement with the theoretical value, 8.159 kDa (the N-terminal methionine is cleaved off). The protein showed a single band (8 kDa) on a SDS-PAGE gel. On a Superdex 75 column the protein eluted as single, symmetrical peak with an apparent weight of 10 kDa. The apparent molecular weight was ca 2 kDa higher than expected, a result of the interaction of NrdH with the matrix. The expressed C. ammoniagenes NrdH is a potent reductant of insulin disulphides in the presence of DTT similarly to E. coli NrdH.2 Overall Structure of the Domain-Swapped Dimer The crystal structure reveals an unexpected dimeric structure of NrdH which is due to three-dimensional domain-swapping (Fig. 1). The refined model of the NrdH dimer at 2.7 Å resolution contains residues 1­74 from both monomers in the asymmetric unit and in total 37 water molecules. Domain-swapping occurs between 2 and 3 of the subunit. An inter-chain two-stranded anti-parallel -sheet is formed from Tyr48 to Gln50 of both monomers at the dimer interface. The Gln50 side chains form weak hydrogen bonds with Ser62 of the same monomer. Helix 2 of both molecules pack against each other, stabilized by electrostatic interactions: Arg40* and Asp37* interact with Asp41 and Arg40 of the other subunit [Fig. 2(A)]. The overall B-factors in the core of the domain-swapped dimer is significantly lower than in the outer parts of the protein [Fig. 1(C)], indicating less flexibility in the area around the domain-swapped interface. The NrdH dimer forms an elongated structure with dimensions of 20 50 Å and is a bipolar charged molecule [Fig. 1(D)]. One side of the molecule has an overall positive

Overall Structure of the Model of the Closed Monomer Eisenberg has defined a monomeric, unswapped polypeptide as a "closed" monomer and the conformation of the corresponding domain in the swapped oligomer as the "open" monomer.18,19 The closed monomer of C. ammoniagenes NrdH belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily and shares the thioredoxin fold with the highly conserved cis-proline (P52) of the thioredoxin family at the beginning of strand 3. The model of the C. ammoniagenes NrdH closed monomer is structurally most similar to E. coli NrdH6 (Table II). An

alignment gives an root mean square (RMS) of 0.83 Å for 72 C -atoms, and both proteins share features that are typical for the NrdH subclass of redoxin proteins.6 C. ammoniagenes NrdH contains the NrdH-redoxin typical W61-S-G-F-[RQ]-P-[DE]67 motif, which forms the end of strand 4, the following loop and the beginning of helix 3. A network of hydrogen bonds positions helix 3 relative to the remaining part of the molecule [Fig. 2(B)]. As in E. coli NrdH, a water molecule, which forms hydrogen bonds to atom N 1 of W61, O 1 of T17, and main chain oxygen and nitrogen atoms of G63 of R65, respectively, plays a central role in this network. A second water molecule that interacts with the main chain oxygen of residue G63 and NH1 of R65 in E. coli NrdH is missing; instead the main chain oxygen of S62 interacts with NH1of R65 in C. ammoniagenes NrdH.

NH1 of R68 and Glu59 O 2 replaces the salt bridge between E67 and R65 in E. coli NrdH.6 As in E. coli NrdH, the main-chain oxygen atom of Q13 and the nitrogen of T17 form a hydrogen bond [Fig. 1(B)]. The Active Site The reactive cysteines are located at the beginning of helix 1. The electron density map clearly shows formation of a disulfide bond between residues C11 and C14, and the structure of NrdH described here is thus the oxidized protein. The architecture of the active site disulfide of the C. ammoniagenes and E. coli NrdH molecules are nearly identical. While the first cysteine of the active site, C11, is surface accessible, C14 lies in a groove formed by residues R8, C11 and Q13. Modelling of Interactions With Thioredoxin Reductase The C. ammoniagenes NrdH monomer has a hydrophobic pocket next to the active site, suggested to be important in the interactions with TrxR.6 V43 forms the bottom of this cavity, surrounded by the hydrophobic residues Y6, I33, A51, and V53. The architecture is only slightly different from that in the E. coli protein where the bottom of the hydrophobic

pocket is formed by L43.6 The hydrophobicity of the side chains lining the pocket is conserved among all known NrdH proteins (Fig. 3), suggesting a similar structural design of the pocket in all NrdH redoxins. However, NrdH from C. ammoniagenes lacks the strongly positive charged surface around the suggested Trx binding cleft present in E. coli NrdH. Superposition of the model of the closed monomer of C. ammoniagenes NrdH onto E. coli NrdH in the model of the E. coli NrdH-TrxR complex,6 indicates that F141 and F142 of TrxR from E. coli, which are conserved in TrxR from C. ammoniagenes, fit well into the hydrophobic pocket of C. ammoniagenes NrdH, similarly to the interactions in the E. coli NrdH-TrxR model complex. The loop from helix 2 to strand 3 in Trx occupies a complementary groove on the surface of TrxR10 in the complex and the corresponding loop in E. coli NrdH could be fitted into this groove in the model complex.6 In C. ammoniagenes NrdH however, this loop is the hinge involved in domain swapping and modelling of this interaction could thus not be performed. Furthermore, in the dimer structure of C. ammoniagenes NrdH, the hydrophobic pocket described above is completely shielded by the second subunit and formation of the domain-swapped dimer would thus prevent binding and reduction by TrxR.

Comparison of NrdH Proteins

M. STEHR AND Y. LINDQVIST

NrdH proteins are mainly characterized by their size ( 10 kDa), and three sequence motifs: the active site C-[VM]Q-C, the conserved cis-P52-V53 and the C-terminal [WF]S-G-F-[RQ]-P-[DE]-motif. To date (6/6/2003) 26 sequences are annotated as NrdH proteins in Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases. A TBLASTN search with the sequence of C. ammoniagenes, NrdH against the finished and unfinished genomes at NCBI, found 13 putative NrdH proteins (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi). The NrdH sequences show identities of 35­99%, align without gaps, and contain the three NrdH motifs (Fig. 3). Based on the sequence differences of the active site and the C-terminal-motif the redoxins form three groups: Group 1 (C-V-Q-C; W-S-G-F-R-P-[ED]), group 2 (C-[MVI]-Q-C; F-SG-F-[RQ]-P), and group 3 (C-[MI]-Q-C; G-P-X-P). V/L43 and V53 that form the bottom of the hydrophobic pocket where TrxR is suggested to bind, are conserved in all NrdH proteins (Fig. 3). All found NrdH redoxin sequences are part of the nrdHIEF operon, coding for an Ib ribonucleotide reductase system. Species of the genus Streptococcus and Lactobacillus lack the nrdI gene in the operon but it is found elsewhere in the genome5 (Fig. 4). The gene NrdF of Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium is separated from nrdE in a range from 862­3100 bp.5,26 DISCUSSION Under certain conditions e.g., high local concentration and a destabilizing milieu, almost any protein is capable of 3D domain-swapping.18 Although the number of known structures of domain-swapped proteins increases, the physiological relevance remains uncertain. Several domainswapped oligomers are only obtained under non-physiological conditions, e.g., during crystallization experiments, but exist in vivo as monomers.19,27,28 Domain swapping can not be predicted from the protein sequence but some features, like the formation of anti-parallel -sheets or presence of glutamine or proline residues in the area of a dimer interface, may promote domain swapping.18,19,28,29 The structure of NrdH-redoxin from C. ammoniagenes is the first example of domain swapping in the thioredoxin family even though a large number of structures from this protein family has been reported. NrdH of C. ammoniagenes shows several similarities to other domain-swapped proteins, making it an interesting target for studies of oligomer formation. The domain-swapped dimer of C. ammoniagenes NrdH has formed an anti-parallel -sheet, similar as in the domain-swapped human prion protein.28 The pronounced bipolar charge [Fig. 1(D)] is similar as in the domain-swapped form of T4 endonuclease.30 As in C. ammoniagenes NrdH, the domain-swapped RNase A and the diphtheria toxin dimer31,32 show a gradual decrease of the B-values from the outside of the protein to the monomer­monomer interface [Fig. 1(C)]. This feature may be a common characteristic for domain-swapped proteins, indicating a thermodynamically favorable state.

Fig. 4. Phylogenetic tree of the NrdH-protein family and distribution and organization of RNR genes. The genetic organization of nrdHIEF and genes is shown on the right. The numbers show the three groups of NrdH proteins as given in Figure 3. The presence or absence of an anaerobic, nrdAB and anaerobic RNR system, nrdDG is indicated with ( ) or ( ). The intergenic region between nrdE and nrdF that is present in species of the genus Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium5,26 is not depicted. Nrd genes located elsewhere in the genome are put in parenthesis. The presence and location of nrdHIEF, nrdAB, nrdDG genes in the genomes were identified with a BLAST search against GenBank sequences or a TBLASTN search against the Entrez finished and unfinished genomes using the E. coli and C. ammoniagenes sequences as templates (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/ genom_table.cgi). The tree was done with NJPlot.36

Why is NrdH from C. ammoniagenes more disposed to domain swapping than NrdH from E. coli? The structures are virtually identical except in the hinge loop that gives rise to domain swapping and in the new dimer interface. The structural differences in the hinge loop are localized to residues 48 ­50. In the E. coli protein these residues, Phe48, Arg49, and Gln50 are part of a bend, making no hydrogen bonds, and Arg49 has a somewhat strained conformation. In the swapped dimer of the C. ammoniagenes protein these residues, Tyr48, Val49, and Gln50, have anti-parallel -sheet conformation with two hydrogenbonds but with Tyr48 in a slightly strained conformation. It seems that introduction of a valine instead of arginine has favored the -conformation and that the hydrogen bonds introduced contribute to compensate for the entropy loss upon dimer formation. Another contributing factor is that the dimer surface in the domain-swapped C. ammoniagenes NrdH is stabilized by a hydrogen-bond network and electrostatic interactions at the interface involving residues on the 2-helices [Fig. 2(A)].

The model of the closed monomer of C. ammoniagenes NrdH is very similar to E. coli NrdH. Both molecules share a hydrogen network stabilizing the loop connecting strand 4 to 3 and a characteristic hydrophobic pocket, however, the surface charge around the pocket is different. Modelling studies shows that the C. ammoniagenes NrdH closed monomer most probably can bind to thioredoxin reductase in a similar way as modelled for E. coli NrdH.6 NrdH-redoxin from C. ammoniagenes exists as a monomer in solution. However, if domain-swapped NrdH also occurs in vivo it could be a mechanism for regulation of its oxidation state since a result of formation of the swapped dimer is the obliteration of the binding site for TrxR, preventing the reduction of NrdH. The in vivo function of NrdH is still not understood. Experimental data suggest that NrdH is the reductant of class Ib RNR which is supported by the finding that all known NrdH sequences are part of the nrdHIEF operon. It was proposed that the NrdHIEF system may be an evolutionary old system, used under microaerophilic conditions or at low cellular glutathione level.6 Lactic acid bacteria, mycobacteria, and corynebacteria lack the NrdAB genes that code for an aerobic RNR, having the Ib system instead. NrdHIEF is the only RNR system of mycobacteria (Fig. 4) and NrdEF seems to be the major aerobic ribonucleotide reductase system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and C. ammonigenes.5,33 This indicates an essential role of NrdHIEF for the ribonucleotide metabolism.
