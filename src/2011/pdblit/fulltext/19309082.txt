The discovery of HpFabZ inhibitors is now of special interest in the treatment of various gastric diseases. In this work, three series of derivatives (compounds 3, 4, and 5) were designed, synthesized, and their biological activities were investigated as potential HpFabZ inhibitors in a two phased manner. First, we designed and synthesized two series of derivatives (3a-r and 4a-u) and evaluated the enzyme-based assay against HpFabZ. Five compounds (3i-k, 3m, and 3q) showed potential inhibitory activity, with IC50 values less than 2 µM. Second, a focused combinatorial library containing 280 molecules was designed employing the LD1.0 program. Twelve compounds (5a-l) were selected and synthesized. The activity of the most potent compound 5h (IC50 ) 0.86 µM) was 46 times higher than that of the hit 1. The high hit rate and the potency of the new HpFabZ inhibitors demonstrated the efficiency of the strategy for the focused library design and virtual screening. 1. Introduction Helicobacter pylori (H. pyloria) has recently been the subject of intense interest because it is a major causative factor for gastrointestinal illnesses such as chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers.1-5 Additionally, infection of H. pylori is also associated with adenocarcinomas and stomach lymphomas, increasing the risk of gastric cancer.6,7 Nevertheless, there is no effective therapy in eradicating H. pylori infection. Combination therapies employing one proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole) and two or three antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, clarithromycin, or tetracycline) have been used as preferred treatments.8-10 However, the multiple therapy regimens have not been very effective in the clinical setting because the bacterium is likely to develop resistance.11-14 Moreover, this treatment may disrupt the natural population of commensal microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to undesired side effects such as diarrhea.15,16 Hence, a new level of treatment is needed to inactivate the key enzymes associated with the bacterial growth. Recently, the pathway of the type-II fatty acid biosynthesis system (FAS-II) has been particularly appreciated as an interest PDB ID codes: 2GLL, 3DOY, 3DOZ, 3DP0, 3DP1, 3DP2, and 3DP3. * To whom correspondence should be addressed (X.S.)

ing target for antibacterial agent discovery due to the major differences of the structural architectures and biological functions that exist between the plastid-associated enzymes of FASII found in most microorganisms and the enzymes involved in FAS-I for mammals and yeast.17-20 FAS-II consists of six key enzymes: FabD, FabH, FabF (or FabB), FabI, FabZ (or FabA), and FabG, all of which work in concert during the synthesis of fatty acid in vivo including the initiation and elongation phases. During the elongation cycle of FAS II, four consecutive reactions complete the extension of two carbons.21,22 In the third step of the elongation cycle, the dehydration of -hydroxy-ACP to trans-2-acyl-ACP is catalyzed by FabZ or FabA. FabA is a bifunctional enzyme and is only found in Gram-negative bacteria with its partner, FabB, to participate in the formation of unsaturated fatty acids.23 However, FabZ has a ubiquitous distribution in the FAS II pathway and is a primary dehydratase that participates in the elongation cycles of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acid biosyntheses. Accordingly, FabZ presents itself as a suitable, yet unexplored target for the discovery of compounds against pathogenic microbes.22,23 So far, the only known small molecule inhibitors of FabZ are flavonoids discovered by random screening against Plasmodium falciparum FabZ (PfFabZ).24 Recently, we discovered two synthetic compounds (1 and 2, Figure 1) as inhibitors of H. pylori FabZ (HpFabZ) with IC50 values of 39.8 ( 0.35 µM

and 47.6 ( 0.29 µM, respectively.25 In addition, we also determined the X-ray crystal structures of HpFabZ in complex with these inhibitors, which demonstrated the inhibitory mechanism of FabZ for the first time.25 In this study, on the basis of the structures and activities of compounds 1 and 2, and their interactive models with HpFabZ as well, we identified several small compounds that inhibit HpFabZ activity with IC50 values of 0.86-42.7 µM by employing a comprehensive approach integrating structure-based design, focused-library design, virtual screening, chemical synthesis, and bioassay. We approached anti-H. pylori therapeutic development employing structure-based design to identify small organic compounds as lead candidates. In the first phase of this study, we designed and synthesized two series of derivatives of compounds 1 and 2 according to the structural models of these inhibitors binding to HpFabZ. Five compounds showed high inhibition activities with IC50 values less than 2 µM, nearly 28 times more potent than the initial starting hits 1 and 2. Afterward, the crystal structures of the complexes of six compounds with the HpFabZ were determined. In the second phase, we adopted a strategy integrating focused combinatorial library design, virtual screening, chemical synthesis, and bioassay to identify more potent inhibitors based on the result of the first phase. Using the fragments taken from the HpFabZ inhibitors identified in the first phase, a focused combinatorial library containing 280 molecules was designed by employing the LD1.0 program26 on the basis of the crystal structures of the inhibitor-HpFabZ complexes. By using docking-based virtual screening targeting the binding site of HpFabZ, 12 compounds (5a-l) were selected for synthesis and bioassay. Eight compounds showed HpFabZ enzymatic inhibition activities with IC50 values of 0.86-42.7 µM. The inhibitory activity of the most potent compound increased 46 times more than that of the original compounds. All the inhibitors discovered in this study showed weak antibacterial activity, overcoming the shortcomings of the original inhibitors (compounds 1 and 2) due to improving the druglikeness of the designed compounds. The high hit rate and the high potency of the new HpFabZ inhibitors demonstrated the efficiency of the discovery strategy used in this study. In addition, the chemical entities reported in this study could be leading factors contributing to the discovery of new therapies against the FAS-II pathway.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Discovery Strategy. On the basis of our previously discovered HpFabZ inhibitors (compounds 1 and 2) and the crystal structures of the inhibitor-HpFabZ complexes, we started to design the new generation HpFabZ inhibitors to increase the enzymatic and antibacterial activities. The flowchart of the discovery strategy and procedure is outlined in Figure 2. In general, the inhibitor-designing process was conducted in a two-phase manner. During the phase I design, a series of derivatives of compounds 1 and 2 were designed and synthesized by a structure-based drug design approach according to the binding models of compounds 1 and 2 with HpFabZ. Several potent inhibitors were selected via an enzymatic activity assay, and the crystal structures of the complexes of the most potent inhibitors with HpFabZ were determined, which was the starting point for the phase II design. During the phase II design, a focused library containing 280 compounds was designed by using the fragments isolated from the inhibitors obtained in the phase I design as building blocks according to the inhibitor-HpFabZ binding models derived from the crystal structures. The structures in the focused library were docked

back into the binding pockets of HpFabZ and were scored by virtual screening functions to select candidates for further synthesis and bioassay. Several new inhibitors were discovered in this phase of the design. Finally, the bacterial growth inhibitory activities of all the obtained HpFabZ inhibitors were assessed. The detailed experimental procedures of each step are described in the following sections. 2.1.1. Phase I Design. On the basis of the structural feature and their interaction models with HpFabZ of compounds 1 and 2, 39 new analogues (3a-r and 4a-u, Tables 1 and 2) were designed and synthesized in the first phase. Keeping the pyridine ring of compound 1, we obtained compounds 3a-d by the removal of the hydroxyl group or bromide or by introducing methoxyl groups to the phenyl ring. Keeping the 2,4-dihydroxy3,5-dibromo phenyl ring and replacing the pyridine ring with the phenyl ring, substituted phenyl ring, methyl, naphthalene ring, or various heterocycles, we obtained compounds 3e-r. On the basis of the structural features of compound 2, we designed compounds 4a-u (Table 2). By changing the substituent groups of the substitutional phenyl ring R3 of compound 2, we got compounds 4a-c. Compounds 4d-r were obtained by introducing various electronic, hydrophobic groups to the ortho-, meta-, or para- position of the unsubstituted phenyl ring R4 of compound 2 or displacing the R4 group with the naphthalin ring. Compounds 4s-u were obtained by displacing the methoxy group with three different amino groups. 2.1.2. Phase II Design. Before phase II design, the X-ray crystal structures of HpFabZ in complex with the inhibitors produced from phase I design were determined, which provide inhibitor-enzyme interaction models for further inhibitor design. A focused library was designed using the structural fragments isolated by the above discovered inhibitors according to the inhibitor-enzyme interaction models. The LD1.0 program26,27 was used during the focused library design. The inhibitor-enzyme interaction models indicate that the HpFabZ inhibitors can be divided into three parts (Figure 3A): part A is located in the large pocket (site A), part B interacts with the small pocket of HpFabZ (site B), and part L is a linker between A and B, interacting with the "saddle" pocket between sites A and B, with a length of 5-6 Å (Figure 3A, middle image). From fragments of HpFabZ inhibitors discovered above and previously,25,28 the LD1.0 program optimized 14 fragments for part A, 5 fragments for part B, and 4 linkers for part L. The chemical structures of the fragments are shown in Figure 4. Then LD1.0 connected these fragments together according to the structure

of HpFabZ binding site, producing a library containing 280 (14 × 4 × 5) molecules. All molecules in the designed library were ranked by the scoring functions of DOCK4.0, AutoDock4.0, and the druglikeness filter of LD1.0 (Figure S1 and Table S1 of the Supporting Information) and analyzed for relatively lower binding energy, favorable shape complementarity, and potential in forming hydrogen bonds with HpFabZ. In this way, 12 compounds (5a-1) were finally selected for synthesis and bioassay. 2.2. Chemical Synthesis. Compounds 3-5 were synthesized through the routes outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. Compounds 6 and 9 were brominated by Br2 in 95% EtOH at room temperature, affording 7 and 10, respectively.29 Compound 7 was methylated by (CH3)2SO4 in DMF in the presence of K2CO3 at 100 °C.30 Commercially available acid 11 was successfully converted to acid hydrazide 12 by a sequential esterification and hydrazinolysis. Then acid hydrazide 12 was condensed with 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in anhydrous EtOH at room temperature, giving the target compounds 1, 3a-r, and 5a-j, respectively.31 Scheme 2 depicts the sequence of reactions that led to the preparation of compounds 2, 4a-u, and 5k-l. Treatment of isothiocyanate 13 with amine 14 in toluene at room temperature quickly afforded thiourea 15a-q and 5k to produce good yields.32 Thiourea 15a-q were condensed with chloroacetic acid and sodium acetate anhydrous in anhydrous EtOH to produce 16a-q. Commercially available substituted amines 17a-b were esterified to afford esters 18a-b. Compounds 18a-b were

dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and diazotized by the addition of a sodium nitrite solution at 0 °C and then treated with 2-furfuraldehyde and cupric chloride to give 19a-b as products.33 In the same manner as the preparation of 19a-b, 19c was prepared from 4-chloro aniline and 2-furfuraldehyde. 19a-c was condensed with 16a-q in EtOH in the presence of piperidine and then hydrolyzed in THF in the presence of LiOH, affording the target compounds 2 and 4a-u. Treatment of commercially available acid 20 with anilines 21 in the presence of pyridine produced amides 5l. The details of the synthetic procedures and structural characterizations are described in the Experimental Section. The combustion analyses and the purities of all these compounds are listed in Tables S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information, respectively. 2.3. Compound Screening. 2.3.1. Virtual Screening. The binding potential between HpFabZ and molecules enumerated from the focused library were evaluated by the scoring module of LD1.0. Docking algorithm and scoring function of DOCK4.034,35 were adopted in the virtual screening. The scoring function of AutoDock4.036 was also used to rank the molecules to avoid the inaccurateness of one scoring function. The X-ray crystal structure of HpFabZ was used as a target for the virtual screening. Residues of HpFabZ around the binding site at a radius of 6.5 Å were isolated for constructing the grids of the docking screening. The resulting substructure included all residues of the binding pocket. During the docking simulation, Kollman-all-atom charges37 were assigned to the protein atoms

and Gasteiger-Marsili charges38 were assigned to the ligand atoms in the library. Conformational flexibility of the molecules from the library was considered in the docking search. The druglikeness of molecules from the combinatorial library was also evaluated by the druglikeness filter of LD1.0.26 The druglikeness descriptor set encoded in LD1.0 is composed of the "Rule of Five" and the other three descriptors of the structural ratio.39,40 For obtaining more information and understanding the synthetical alternation, we broadened the constraint of the molecular weight to 600. The range of evaluation on druglikeness is between 0 and 1, which stands for nondruglikeness and druglikeness, respectively.40 All the parameters used in the LD1.0 were described in our previous paper.26 2.3.2. Enzymatic Activity Assay. The enzymatic inhibition assay of HpFabZ was monitored by the spectrophotomeric method as described previously.21,25 In brief, the activity of HpFabZ was measured by the detection of the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm for the conversion of crotonoyl-CoA to

-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The compounds dissolved in 1% DMSO were incubated with the enzyme for 1 h before the assays were started. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each inhibitor was estimated by fitting the inhibition data to a dose-dependent curve using a logistic derivative equation.41 2.3.3. Antibacterial Assay. The bacterial growth inhibition activity for the compounds was evaluated by using the paper discus method. Dimethyl sulfoxide and ampicillin paper were used as negative and positive controls respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined by the standard agar dilution method42 using Columbia agar supplemented with 10% sheep blood containing 2-fold serial dilutions of agents. A bacterial suspension of H. pylori was made by swabbing and suspending the cells in sterile saline with a turbidity equivalent to a 2.0 McFarland standard. Compound-free Columbia agar media were used as controls. Inoculated plates were incubated at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions (85% N2, 10% CO2, and 5% O2) and examined after

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Identification of Inhibitors by Phase I Design. In our previous study,25 we discovered two small molecular inhibitors of HpFabZ (compounds 1 and 2) and determined the X-ray crystal structures of the inhibitor-enzyme complexes. This provided a solid foundation for designing more potent HpFabZ inhibitors. Compound 1 is composed of a pyridine ring and a 2,4-dihydroxy-3,5-dibromo phenyl ring linked by a formohydrazide moiety. The crystal structure revealed that two molecules of compound 1 bind to one hexamer of HpFabZ with two distinct interactive models: one molecule fits into the groove around the entrance (model A, Figure 5) and the other molecule lies at the active site of the tunnel (model B, Figure 5). Compound 2 is mainly composed of four rings: a phenyl ring at one end, a 2-chloro-benzoic acid moiety at the other end, and two heterocycles (a furan ring and a thiazolidinone substituted by a 2-methoxy-ethyl chain) in the middle. The crystal structure illustrated that compound 2 binds to monomer B of HpFabZ with a binding model similar to model A of compound 1. In model A, the two aromatic ends of either compound 1 or 2 are sandwiched between the two "lips" of the HpFabZ entrance via hydrophobic interactions. Hence, during

phase I design, we modify the two aromatic ends of compounds 1 and 2 to enhance the hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme, producing 39 compounds (designated as series 3 and 4). The chemical structures of the 39 designed compounds (3a-r and 4a-u) are shown in Tables 1 and 2. These compounds were synthesized through the routes outlined in Schemes 1 and 2, and the details of the synthetic procedures and structural characterizations are described in the Experimental Section. The primary inhibitory activities of these compounds at 50 µM against HpFabZ were determined, and the results are also listed in Tables 1 and 2. Bioassay detail is described in the Experimental Section. The primary data indicate that seven compounds (3h-k, 3m, 3n, and 3q) are more active than the leading hit (compound 1) (Table 1). Encouraged by this result, we determined the quantitative inhibition activities (IC50 values) for seven compounds. The results are also listed in Table 1. As IC50 values indicated, the inhibitory activities of these seven inhibitors increased about 4-28 times in comparison with that of compound 1. Structure-activity relationship results indicated that removal of the bromine substituents of the phenyl ring (3a-3c) or replacement of the hydroxyl group with methoxyl (3d) decreases the inhibitory activities of compounds. The inhibitory activities of compounds (3e, 3f, 3p, and 3r) obtained by replacing the pyridine ring of 1, respectively, with phenyl

ring, furan ring, methyl, and 4-hydroxy benzyl decreased. While compounds produced by replacing the pyridine ring of 1 with more hydrophobic groups such as halogen (F, Cl, and Br) substituted phenyl rings (3g-k), a naphthalene ring (3m) and a methoxy substituted phenyl ring (3n) show more potent inhibitory activities than that of compound 1. Slight improvement in inhibitory activities were observed when the pyridine ring of 1 was displaced by a thiophene ring (3l) and a tertbutyl substituted phenyl ring (3q). When the position of the N-atom of the pyridine ring is changed (3o), tremendous decrease of inhibitory activities was observed. Table 2 lists the chemical structures and inhibitory data of compound 2 and its derivatives 4a-u. Unfortunately, no potent active compounds have been discovered by the modification of compound 2, most of derivatives were proven to have completely lost the inhibitory activities. Accordingly, in the following X-ray crystallography study and new inhibitor design, we only focused on the analogues of compound 1. 3.2. Binding Models of the Inhibitors to HpFabZ Detected by X-ray Crystallography. To obtain more information for further inhibitor design and to investigate the potential inhibition mechanism, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) structures for the complexes of HpFabZ with the seven most

potent inhibitors (3h-k, 3m, 3n, and 3q) using X-ray crystallography. Except inhibitor 3h, all other six compounds soaked into the binding sites of HpFabZ. The structural models are shown in Figure 3 and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. The coordinates and structural factors of these crystal structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes are 3DOY, 3DOZ, 3DP0, 3DP1, 3DP2, and 3DP3, respectively). The binding models of these compounds with HpFabZ are shown in Figure 3. The crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement (MR) to resolutions of 2.3-2.5 Å. The final structures of inhibitor-HpFabZ are well ordered, and the electron densities for all residues with the exception of the N-terminus (residues 1-10) are clearly interpretable. The statistics of the diffraction data and structure refinement are listed in Tables S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information. The overall structure of HpFabZ in the complexes is similar to that of the native HpFabZ (PDB code is 2GLL),25 displaying a classic "trimer of dimers" organization. Each HpFabZ dimer forms two substrate-binding tunnels with catalytic sites on the interface, which are 20 Å away from each other (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Except compound 3m, five other inhibitors bind to HpFabZ in a similar way to compound 1.25 For 3i-k, 3n, and 3q, two molecules of each compound bind to one hexamer of HpFabZ with two distinct interaction models: one molecule fits into the groove around the entrance with an extended conformation (Figure 3A) (designated as model A hereinafter); the other molecule lies at the active site of the tunnel with a folded conformation (Figure 3B) (called model B below). For model A, Tyr100 and Phe83 adopt open and closed conformations, respectively, thus the R1 substituent (see Table 1) of each compound is located between the phenol ring of Tyr100 and the pyrrolidine ring of Pro112, forming a sandwich structure, and the R2 substituent at the other end of the inhibitor binds into a pocket composed of Arg158, Glu159, Phe59, and Lys62 through hydrophobic interactions, particularly, the aromatic ring of R2 substituent form a  · · ·  stacking interaction with the side chain of Phe69, and cation · · ·  interactions with the positively charged side chains of Lys62 and Arg158 (Figure 3A). For model B, Tyr100 adopted a closed conformation and Phe83 adopted an open conformation and the whole molecules of the inhibitors entered into the middle of the tunnel, located near the active site of HpFabZ (His58 and Glu72). However, the orientation of the designed inhibitors inside the tunnel of enzyme is opposite to that of compound 1: the R1 substituent is sandwiched between Ile98 and Phe59, while the R2 substituent moves deeply to the catalytic site of the tunnel, contacting with Ile20, Leu21, Pro22, Phe83, Ala94, Lys97, and Val99 via hydrophobic interactions (Figure 3B). Different from the other five inhibitors, compound 3m was observed to bind to HpFabZ only with model A. The reason is possibly that the steric hindrance caused by the bulky naphthalene prevents the inhibitor from entering further into the tunnel (Figure 3C). Also, compound 3m fits well into the entrance of the tunnel with an extended conformation; however, the 2,4-dihydroxyl-3,5-dibromo phenyl ring binds more tightly with the hydrophobic pocket lined by Arg158, Glu159, Phe59, and Lys62 so that two hydroxyl groups of 3m form two strong hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), respectively, with the backbone carbonyl of Glu159 and the guanidinium group of Arg158. These additional H-bonds led 3m to be equal or more active than other compounds although this compound can only bind to the enzyme with one model.

3.3. Identification of Inhibitors by the Phase II Design. The two binding models of the phase I designed compounds with HpFabZ indicate that compounds with bulky substituents like compound 3m still show high activities despite that only one binding model (model A) exists. This may be structurally attributed to that the 2,4-dihydroxyl-3,5-dibromo phenyl ring binds more tightly with the hydrophobic pocket lined by Arg158, Glu159, Phe59, and Lys62 so that two hydroxyl groups of 3m form two strong hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), respectively, with the backbone carbonyl of Glu159 and the guanidinium group of Arg158. Thus, in the phase II compound design, a focused library was designed only according to model A (Figure 3A). Model A clearly illustrates that the inhibitors discovered through the phase I design could be divided into three parts (Figure 3A): part A interacts with the large pocket of HpFabZ composed of Tyr100, Met102, Phe109, Ile111, and Pro112 (site A); part B resides in the small pocket lined by Lys62, Arg158, Glu159, Phe59, and Pro22 (site B); and part L is a linker between A and B, interacting with the "saddle" pocket between sites A and B with a length of 5-6 Å. According to the structural diversity of the previously discovered inhibitors, we selected 14 fragments for part A, five fragments for part B, and four linkers for part L (Figure 4). Combining these fragments

together, a 14 × 4 × 5 focused library was obtained by using LD1.0.26 Targeting the crystal structure of HpFabZ, the focused library was screened by using the scoring function of DOCK4.034,35 that has been encoded in LD1.0. The interaction energies of these 280 molecules to HpFabZ calculated by the DOCK4.0 function range from -47.68 to -22.57 kcal/mol (Figure S1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information). However, docking programs and scoring functions have a tendency to generate a significant number of false positives.43 To reduce the number of false positives in compound selection, the binding poses of these 280 molecules with HpFabZ were redocked using AutoDock4.0,36 which has a better ability to optimize binding poses as well as predict binding energy.44 AutoDock4.0 calculation indicates that the binding free energies of the compounds to HpFabZ range from -10.16 to -5.96 kcal/ mol (Table S1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Considering these two scoring results, structural diversity, druglikeness, and synthetic feasibility, 12 compounds (5a-l) were selected and synthesized for actual biological testing and their chemical structures are shown in Table 3. The primary inhibition activities of compounds 5a-l against HpFabZ at 10 µM were measured. The results are also listed in Table 3. Of the 12 compounds, eight showed enhanced inhibition activities against HpFabZ at 10 µM. Thus, the IC50 values of these eight compounds were also determined (Table 3) and the IC50 values of five compounds (5c, 5f, 5g, 5h, and 5j) were discovered less than 4 µM. The IC50 value of compound 5h (0.86 ( 0.01 µM) was 46 times higher than that of starting compound 1 (IC50) 39.8 ( 0.35 µM). The focused library broadened the diversity of subtituents R1 and R2 and the linkers between them. The result demonstrated that hydroxyl substituted naphthalene, 2,4-dihydroxy-3,5-dibromo phenyl ring and methyleneformohydrazide seem to be the optimized fragments for R1, R2, and linker. 3.4. Antibacterial Activity. Fifteen compounds (3h-k, 3m-n, 3q, 5b-d, and 5f-j) were shown to be inhibitors of HpFabZ through two cycles design. Their antibacterial activities were tested against the H. pylori strains SS1 and ATCC4 using the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) approach. The results are listed in Tables 1 and 3. Twelve compounds showed weak antibacterial properties, with MIC values of 50-100 µg/ mL. Because of poor solubility, we did not obtained the MIC values of compounds 3h and 3n. Compounds 3i and 5b are inactive in inhibiting the growth of H. pylori strain even at a concentration of >100 µg/mL. Among the compounds, 3m, 3q,

5c, 5f,and 5j displays encouraging antibacterial activity against one strain (SS1 or ATCC4) compared with compounds 1 and 2 without any antibacterial activity. Although the antibacterial activities of the compounds that were determined are not so

high in comparison with existing antibiotics, they provide leading factors contributing to the discovery of new therapies against the FAS-II pathway. Although the most potent inhibitor (compound 5h) discovered in this study is structurally similar

to the patented antibacterial45 or antimetazoan parasite compounds,46 it is purely incidental. Nevertheless, this further illustrates that our discovery strategy is reasonable because the design procedure converged some of the HpFabZ inhibitors into similar structures of existing antibacterial compounds. In addition, the molecular targets of the patented antibacterial compounds are unknown, our study accidentally found that FabZ may be one of the targets of these compounds. Of note, this study only implied that HpFabZ is a target of the antibacterial compounds similar to 5h. The target specificity of these compounds or whether their antibacterial activity is associated with other target needs to be further explored. 3.5. Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR). Bioassay indicates that, of the 12 binders, eight compounds (5b-d and 5f-j) showed strong HpFabZ inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.86-42.7 µM in Table 3 and the activity of the most potent one 5h (0.86 µM) increased 46 times. Structurally, compounds 5a-j have similar chemical scaffolds with the B1 fragment (Figure 4), indicating that B1 is the most optimized fragment for part B. Fragments for part A are structurally more diverse than fragments for part B; fragments A2-5, A7-10, and A14 are the building blocks of part A for the HpFabZ inhibitors. Observing the crystal structures, the linker is with a length of 5-6 Å, which can involve 3-4 atoms and is relatively rigid in a way that reduces the entropy loss when fitting into the steric restraint binding groove. Considering the length and rigidity of saddle and synthetic feasibility, the diversity of candidate linkers is constrained. According to bioisostere replacement, four representive linkers (L1-L4) were finally selected with similar length and rigidity in the focused library design. The results illustrated that compounds with moderate or potent HpFabZ activity contain the L4 regiment as the linker and indicated that L4 is the most favorable fragment for the linker between parts A and B. Accordingly, as the HpFabZ inhibitors, the building blocks for parts B and L are fixed at fragments B1 and L4 and the fragment for part A is a little bit flexible. The reason underlying the structure-activity relationship of compounds 3 and 5 can be addressed from the X-ray crystal structures of HpFabZ in complex with 3i-k, 3m, 3n, and 3q (Figure 3). In model A, inhibitors bind to the entrance of HpFabZ tunnel: the substituented phenyl ring of compound 3 (except 3m) is located between the phenol ring of Tyr100 and the pyrrolidine ring of Pro112, forming a sandwich structure. The hydrophobic interactions between the phenyl ring of inhibitors and residues Phe109, Ile111, and Met102 stabilized the inhibitors in the right place, and the 2,4-dihydroxy-3,5dibromo phenyl ring at the other end of compound 1 binds with a pocket formed by Arg158, Glu159, Phe59, and Lys62 through hydrophobic interactions. Extraordinarily, the aromatic ring of R2 substituent is involved in a  · · ·  stacking interaction with the side chain of Phe59 in addition to cation- interactions with the positively charged side chains of Lys62 and Arg158. In model B, compound 3 (except 3m) entered into the middle of the tunnel, located near the active site of HpFabZ (His58 and Glu72): the 2,4-dihydroxy-3,5-dibromo phenyl ring almost accessed the exit of the tunnel, contacting with Ile20, Leu21, Pro22, Phe83, Ala94, Lys97, and Val99 via hydrophobic interactions while the substituented phenyl is sandwiched between Ile98 and Phe59. Different from the other five inhibitors, compound 3m was observed to bind to HpFabZ only with model A. It exclusively adopted an extended linear conformation with good shape complementarity with the binding tunnel a little differently. Because of steric hindrance imposed by the bulky naphthalene ring of the inhibitor, the 2,4-

dihydroxyl-3,5-dibromo phenyl ring binds more tightly with the hydrophobic pocket lined by Arg158, Glu159, Phe59, and Lys62 so that two hydroxyl groups of 3m form two strong hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), respectively, with the backbone carbonyl of Glu159 and the guanidinium group of Arg158. The binding models of compound 3i-k, 3m, 3n, and 3q with HpFabZ clearly illustrated that structural modifications that increase the hydrophobicities of R1 and R2 may increase the inhibition activities due to enhancement of the binding affinity (Tables 2 and 3). Compounds with a large hydrophobic group (naphthalene ring or 9H-fluorene ring) possess the potent inhibitory activity due to forming two strong hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), respectively, with the backbone carbonyl of Glu159 and the guanidinium group of Arg158. The additional hydrogen bond play vital roles for these compounds binding to the HpFabZ, and this may be an important reason that these compounds could potentially inhibit HpFabZ. However, no further activity improvements were observed with even bulkier fragments (5b, 5e, 5k, and 5l) than the substituent naphthalene; this probably contributed to the size limit of the pocket (site A in Figure 3).

4. Conclusions
The discovery of HpFabZ inhibitors is now of special interest in the treatment of gastric diseases. In the present study, a series of hydrazine derivatives and a series of novel thiazolidone derivatives were designed, synthesized based on the screening hits 1 and 2. All the compounds were evaluated by the cellbased assay for their inhibitory activities against HpFabZ. Six compounds (3i, 3j, 3k, 3m, and 3q) for concentration-response studies showed prominent inhibitory activities, five compounds with IC50 values less than 2 µM, which is nearly 25 times more potent than the initial compound 1. To discover novel entries of HpFabZ inhibitors with more potent activities, on the basis of the chemical structures of the HpFabZ inhibitors we discovered previously and the modes of binding to HpFabZ in the crystal of the complexes of small molecules with the HpFabZ, a focused library has been designed by using the combinatorial library design program LD1.0.26 Through virtual screening and druglike analysis, 12 compounds were selected from the focused library for chemical synthesis and bioassay. Remarkably, eight compounds among the 12 molecules show HpFabZ inhibitor activities, with IC50 values ranging from 0.86 to 42.7 µM (Table 3). The hit rate for inhibitors is 66.7%. In comparison with the results in the phase I design, inhibitory activities of the active compounds designed in the phase II are moderately improved (Table 3). The crystallography study demonstrated that six compounds (3i-k, 3m-n, and 3q) bind to the binding pocket of HpFabZ in a similar way: part A fits into site A, part B is located in site B, and part L interacts with the saddle site of HpFabZ. The bioassay results indicate that the fragment combinations for potent HpFabZ inhibitors are A2-5, A7-10, and L4 in conjunction with B1. In addition, most of the active compounds discovered in this study are leading factors contributing to the discovery of new therapies against the FAS-II pathway, so the encouraging results in vitro activities may possess potential for the treatment of H. pylori infections based on new mechanisms.

The enzymatic inhibition assay of HpFabZ was monitored by the spectrophotomeric method as described previously.21,25 In brief, the activity of HpFabZ was measured by detection of the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm for the conversion of crotonoyl-CoA to -hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The compounds dissolved in 1% DMSO were incubated with the enzyme for 1 h before the assays were started. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each inhibitor was estimated by fitting the inhibition data to a dose-dependent curve using a logistic derivative equation.41 Anti-H. pylori Activity Assay. The bacterial growth inhibition activity for the compounds was evaluated by using Paper Discus Method. Dimethyl sulfoxide and ampicillin paper were used as negative and positive control respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were determined by the standard agar dilution method42 using Columbia agar supplemented with 10% sheep blood containing 2-fold serial dilutions of agents. Bacterial suspension of H. pylori was made by swabbing and suspending the cells in sterile saline with a turbidity equivalent to a 2.0 McFarland standard. Compound-free Columbia agar media were used as controls. Inoculated plates were incubated at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions (85% N2, 10% CO2 and 5% O2) and examined after 3 days. The MIC was generally defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that completely inhibits visible bacterial growth. Crystallization and Data Collection. The crystals of HpFabZ were obtained as described previously,24 and then soaked by adding a final concentration of 20 mM inhibitors for 24 h. Diffraction data was collected at 100K using Cu KR X-ray with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ image plate. Before crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, the drop was dehydrated against 500 µL reservoir solution containing 4.0 M sodium formate for 24 h. The data was processed using mosfilm program package.48 Analysis of the diffraction data indicated that the crystals belong to space group P212121. The crystallographic statistics are summarized in Tables

S4 and S5 in Supporting Information). The structures were solved by molecular replacement method with the crystal structure of HpFabZ as the search model (PDB code 2GLL) and refined by using the program CNS.49 Electron density interpretation and model building were performed using the computer graphics program "coot".50
