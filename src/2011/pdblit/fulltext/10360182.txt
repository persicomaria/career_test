Abstract Tick histamine-binding proteins (HBPs) are lipocalins with two binding pockets. One of these binds histamine with a high affinity and is found at the position expected from other lipocalins, adjacent to the 6-loop at the open-end of the L-barrel. A second binding cavity, which is a low-affinity site for histamine in one of the HBPs, is located at the end of the barrel that is closed off in other lipocalins. In order to create the second site, the `closed-end' region has undergone a major reconstruction. Typical lipocalin characteristics, such as the 310 helix and a structural cluster of highly conserved residues, have been lost, while an K-helix now shields the cavity from the exterior. The prominence of acidic residues in the binding pockets is another distinctive characteristic of HBPs. Whereas most lipocalins have highly hydrophobic binding cavities designed to bind lipophilic compounds, HBPs have evolved to trap cationic, hydrophilic molecules. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Biological signi¢cance of HBPs Histamine, a decarboxylation product of histidine, has an important role in in£ammation and allergy. It is mainly produced by tissue mast cells and blood basophils, where it is secreted in response to IgEmediated or non-speci¢c mechanisms (e.g. as a consequence of antigen challenge or tissue damage). Histamine acts by binding to speci¢c, membrane-bound, G-protein-coupled receptors on target cells. Of these, the so-called H1- and H2- receptors are involved in in£ammation, but other, less well characterised receptors may also play a role [1,2].

Histamine-mediated cutaneous in£ammation is one of the defence reactions host animals mount against blood-feeding ticks. It is established that histamine not only adversely a¡ects the attachment of ticks to the skin of their host, but also directly or indirectly diminishes their feeding and reproductive success [3^5]. In turn, ticks have developed strategies to suppress the host responses. The ixodid tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus suppresses in£ammation by secreting histamine-binding proteins into the wound site. These HBPs sequester locally secreted histamine molecules, preventing them from reaching their target cells [6]. Three closely related HBPs, termed RaHBP1, RaHBP2 and RaHBP3, have been isolated from salivary glands of feeding R. appendiculatus ticks. The stage- and sex-speci¢c secretion of these HBPs may

be linked to di¡erences in feeding behaviour. Adult female ticks produce RaHBP1 and RaHBP2, whereas RaHBP3 is exclusively secreted by larvae, nymphs and adult male ticks. Recombinant versions of the proteins (produced in insect cells) bind 3 H-histamine speci¢cally and with high a¤nity. RaHBP1 is, however, somewhat less e¤cient in binding histamine (Kd = 1.8U1038 M, compared to 1.7U1039 M and 1.2U1039 M for RaHBP2 and RaHBP3, respectively). In addition, RaHBP1 is secreted simultaneously with RaHBP2, and therefore binding histamine may not be its primary function. Instead, it may counter in£ammation by sequestering other, host-derived in£ammatory compounds, or by transferring tick-derived antagonists into the wound site. Alternatively, it may interfere with haemostasis, as do other lipocalins secreted in the saliva of blood-feeding arthropods [7,8]. Overall, the production of at least three histaminebinding proteins by a single tick species suggests that the molecules have acquired di¡erent functions. Such a diversi¢cation has been described for the four nitrophorin variants secreted in the saliva of the bloodsucking insect Rhodnius prolixus. All four of these lipocalins carry nitric oxide into the feeding site and bind histamine, but only nitrophorin-2 also inhibits coagulation factor X activation [7]. 2. Primary structure and molecular characteristics Fig. 1 gives the alignment of the three HBP primary structures, as inferred from cDNA sequences, and shows the lipocalin structure they assume. The three proteins clearly belong to the same family, and the female-speci¢c proteins are more closely related to each other than to the male-speci¢c protein [6]. Amongst the residues conserved between all three molecules are four cysteines and four tryptophans. There is no obvious sequence similarity with known lipocalins and the three structurally conserved regions (SCRs) found in other members of the lipocalin-family [9], are not obvious in the primary structures. The HBPs show limited sequence similarity with moubatin, a salivary platelet aggregation inhibitor from the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata [8], suggesting an evolutionary link.

RaHBP1 (172 AA) and RaHBP2 (171 AA) are secreted as non-glycosylated, 20-kDa monomers. RaHBP3 (182 AA), on the other hand, is a glycosylated, disul¢de-linked dimer with an approximate molecular mass of 45 kDa. 3. Overall tertiary structure of RaHBP2 The structure of RaHBP2, complexed with histaî mine, was determined at 1.25 A, the highest resolution for a lipocalin to date. Because they assume an eight-stranded anti-parallel L-barrel fold with a repeated +1 topology, tick HBPs are classi¢ed as members of the lipocalin superfamily. However, HBPs lack some of the hallmarks of typical lipocalins, most notably the amino-terminal 310 helix, the GlyXxx-Trp lipocalin signature sequence in L-strand A, and the conserved, carboxyterminal Arg (or Lys) of L-strand H [9]. The absence of the 310 helix is surprising. This somewhat unusual structure is normally conserved within the lipocalins and among the structurally related fatty acid-binding proteins and avidins. The 310 helix lies at the so-called `closed end' of the barrel, distal to the usual lipocalin binding cavity. Together with a structural cluster of the most conserved residues of the three SCRs (a Ser or Thr of SCR2, the Trp of the signature sequence and the carboxyterminal, basic amino acid of LH), the 310 helix seals o¡ the structure, and consolidates the L-barrel by bringing the ends of several of the strands together [9^11]. The absence of both the 310 helix and the cluster of conserved structural residues in HBPs appears to be linked to another distinctive characteristic of the tick lipocalins, namely the presence of a separate, second internal binding site. Whereas a high-a¤nity histamine-binding (H) site is found at the expected position (the `open end' of the typical lipocalin barrel), the second (L) site is positioned at the end of the Lbarrel that is normally closed o¡. The creation of the L pocket (and possibly its ligand entry site) appears to have resulted from a major reconstruction of this part of the barrel, including the loss of the 310 helix and the structural cluster. Instead an extended amino-terminus containing a one-turn K1- and a threeturn K2-helix now dominates this region of the protein, and determines the relative positions of the

loops. The K1-helix forms hydrogen bonds with the LD^LE loop, whereas the K2-helix makes connections with the two other loops and with the ends of L-strands E, B and G. The K2-helix also contributes three residues to the underlying L site. In the RaHBP2 crystal, the L pocket binds histamine, but apparently with low a¤nity. Repeated rinsing of the crystal in mother liquor easily removes histamine from the L, but not from the H site. Binding of 3 H-histamine to the L site, moreover, appears too weak to show up in Scatchard plots [6]. The only other lipocalin for which two binding sites have been suggested is L-lactoglobulin. Although the existence of the second site remains speculative [12], it has nevertheless been described as an external binding pocket, situated in a groove

on the surface of the barrel [13]. Like lipocalins, fatty acid-binding proteins generally contain single binding sites. The liver fatty acid-binding protein, exceptionally, can accommodate two oleate molecules in its central cavity, one of which is bound with a higher a¤nity. However, unlike the H and L sites of HBPs, these binding pockets are not compartmentalised, and the two ligands are stacked on top of each other [14,15]. 4. Comparative amino acid composition and charge The sequence alignment in Fig. 1 shows 11 extra amino acids in RaHBP3 (compared to RaHBP2). These have been inserted into the loop regions be-

tween the L-strands, or at the carboxyterminal region. One (Asp) residue is added to L-strand H. With the exception of the LA^LB connection, all loops in RaHBP1 and RaHBP2 contain acidic amino acids, but no basic residues. Both proteins have a remarkable excess of acidic residues, possessing an overall net charge of 321. As a consequence, the molecular surface of RaHBP2 has a strong electrostatic potential (Fig. 2), which may help draw cationic compounds, such as histamine, towards the protein before the actual binding event takes place. The calculated pI of both RaHBP1 and RaHBP2 is 3.9. In RaHBP3, the number of acidic residues in the loop regions is reduced, while basic amino acids have been inserted. Homology modelling puts all the positively charged residues on the surface of the barrel, while acidic sidegroups are still found in the interior of the protein. The presence of cationic sidegroups on the surface of RaHBP3 may explain why it behaves as a neutral protein during ion-exchange chromatography, despite a (calculated) acidic pI of 5.0. 5. Cysteines and tryptophans The disul¢de-bridge pattern in HBPs di¡ers from that in other members of the lipocalin family. In insect lipocalins that carry protoporphyrin IX derivatives (nitrophorins, bilin-binding protein and insecticyalin), one disul¢de-bridge links L-strand B with LG, while the other couples the N-terminus with the

region in between the two carboxyterminal helices. Disul¢de bonds in other vertebrate lipocalins commonly connect the LD strand to the most carboxyterminal K-helix [16,17]. In HBPs, the disul¢debridges pin the carboxy-terminal region to the side of the barrel; Cys-119^Cys-148 couples the K3 helix to the LG strand, and Cys-169^Cys-48 connects the LI strand to the base of the 6-loop. The sidegroups of two of the four conserved tryptophan residues (Trp-42 and Trp-137 in RaHBP2) are buried deep inside the protein, where they form part of the H and L binding sites, respectively. The two other tryptophans lie more towards the surface of the HBP. Remarkably, the sidegroup of Trp-5 is surrounded by four tyrosine rings coming from different parts of the protein (Tyr-90 from LD^LE loop, Tyr-123 from LG, Tyr-134 from LH and Tyr-155 from the K3 helix). This hydrophobic nest of aromatic sidegroups is well conserved in all three HBPs, although RaHBP3 sometimes uses phenylalanine, rather than tyrosine rings (Tyr-123 and Tyr-155 appear to align with phenylalanines in RaHBP3). The rings ¢ll the space between the barrel and three structures protruding from it (the carboxyterminal K3-helix, the aminoterminal K1-helix and the D^E loop), thus giving the HBPs a particularly globular appearance (Fig. 2). The fourth conserved tryptophan (Trp-18) lies on the K2 helix and points towards the exterior. It is only covered by the protruding LB^LC loop, which it appears to push away from the barrel.

6. Histamine Histamine consists of an imidazole ring and an amino group connected by two carbon atoms. While the pentagonal ring is planar and rigid, the single bonds in the carbon atom chain permit rotation allowing the molecule to take on di¡erent isoforms. Both the ring and the amino group are basic centres and are protonated in an acidic environment. At a su¤ciently low pH, the predominant form of histamine is fully protonated, and appears as a dication, with both the ring and the amino group positively charged. At a higher (physiological) pH, the ring loses a proton and becomes neutral, while the amino group remains positively charged. This monocationic form exists as two tautomers, with either one of the two nitrogen atoms of the ring carrying the remaining proton. In basic conditions, the amino group also loses a proton and histamine is predominantly un-

charged. Histamine is thus a mixture of many species, and can rapidly convert into other ionic forms, tautomers and conformers [18]. 7. The H site The two histamine binding sites are unusual. Whereas other lipocalins have mainly hydrophobic binding pockets (consistent with binding hydrophobic molecules), the binding sites in HBPs are lined with several negatively charged sidegroups (ideally tailored to bind a basic ligand). The H site of RaHBP2 contains four negatively charged residues (Asp-39, Glu-82, Asp-110, and Glu-135), and no positive charges. It therefore represents a very acidic microenvironment, in which histamine probably takes on its dicationic form. In accordance with this, the sidegroups of Glu-82 and

97

Asp-39 each appear to interact with one of the nitrogens of the imidazole ring (suggesting it is fully protonated and positively charged), while Glu-135 and Asp-110 form bonds with the amino group at the tip of the tail. In addition to the glutamic and aspartic acids, a number of uncharged residues are involved in immobilising the histamine molecule. Most notable are the aromatic rings of Phe-108 and Trp-42, which lie almost parallel to one another, sandwiching the imidazole ring of histamine. Overall, the H site seems to be a very e¤cient binding pocket in which histamine is tightly bound in a small volume (Fig. 3). The extended 6-loop, which links L-strands A and B (AA36^AA47), provides four of the nine amino acids that interact with the histamine molecule (Tyr-36, Asp-39, Val-41 and Trp-42; Table 1). The four negatively charged residues of the H site are conserved among the three RaHBPs, as are most of the other residues £anking the cavity (see Table 1 and Fig. 3). The H site of RaHBP3 only di¡ers from

that of RaHBP2 in the substitution of Tyr-36 by a Gln. The Kd values indicate that, if anything, this substitution strengthens rather than weakens the binding of histamine. In RaHBP1, Phe-108 has been replaced by a Leu. Although this is the only substitution that has occurred, it apparently leads to a greatly diminished a¤nity for histamine, probably because of the loss of aromatic stacking interactions with the imidazole ring. 8. The L site Perhaps consistent with its lower a¤nity for histamine, only two negatively charged residues occur in the L site of RaHBP2. Of these, Asp-120 hydrogen bonds with the amino group of the histamine-tail, and Asp-24 interacts with both the amino group and one of the nitrogens of the imidazole ring. This suggests a partially protonated, neutral ring, and thus a monocationic histamine ligand. Similar to the H site, the sidegroups of a Trp (-137) and a Phe (-98) residue are positioned at both sides of the imidazole moiety. However, a stacking of the aromatic rings as seen in the H site does not occur in the L site. By contributing three amino acids (Ser-20, Leu-21 and Asp-24), the K2-helix is a major participant in the binding of histamine at the L site. The low a¤nity for histamine suggests that in vivo a compound other than histamine may occupy the L site. Notably, the grip on the imidazole ring seems to have been loosened (compared to the H pocket), whereas the amino group is still ¢rmly held in place by the two acidic residues. This suggests that another (probably monocationic) amine may act as the natural ligand for the L pocket. The RaHBP2 L site resembles the one in RaHBP3. The two aspartic acids are retained, as are the other, uncharged residues, with the exception of Phe-98 which is replaced by a leucine. Since no stacking of aromatic rings occurs in the L site, this substitution is probably less in£uential on the (already weak) binding of histamine than the Phe-to-Leu swap in the H site of RaHBP1. The L sites of RaHBP3 and RaHBP2 thus appear to be designed for the same (or very similar) ligands. Despite its higher overall sequence similarity to

RaHBP2 (compared to RaHBP3), RaHBP1 contains a highly aberrant L site. Half the residues £anking the cavity di¡er from those found in RaHBP2, and the two acidic amino acids have been replaced by neutral, hydrophobic residues (a leucine and a tyrosine). The RaHBP1 L site is therefore uncharged (unless His-20 is protonated), and may bind a yet unknown, possibly hydrophobic ligand. 9. The septum The two binding pockets in RaHBP2 are clearly separated from each other. Tyr-100, together with a water molecule, forms a central barrier between the two histamine ligands. Other amino acids (most notably Glu-135 and Trp-137, both from the well conserved LH strand) participate in the formation of the septum between the two sites (Fig. 4). Tyr-100, Glu135 and Trp-137 are conserved in all three HBPs, consistent with all three molecules possessing two distinct binding sites.

10. The H site entrance Ligands of canonical lipocalins presumably access their binding sites through the open end of the barrel, as is illustrated for the epididymal retinoic-acid binding protein [19]. The cavities themselves can be partially (in the case of large ligands) or completely (small ligands) closed o¡ by the extended 6-loop, which links L-strands A and B [20]. Although the position of the H pocket (adjacent to the `open end' and the 6-loop) is typical for a lipocalin binding site, it seems unlikely that histamine enters the protein through the central opening. In the RaHBP2 crystal, bound histamine points its amino group towards the wall of the barrel, with the imidazole head towards the central opening. If histamine were to enter via the `open end' of the barrel, the amino group would presumably enter the protein before the imidazole ring. This is at odds with the observed binding of the HBPs by histamine-agarose (used to isolate the native proteins from tick salivary gland extracts [6]). In histamine-agarose, the amino group in the tail of histamine is cross-linked to a 16-atom

G.C. Paesen et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1482 (2000) 92^101

99

spacer, making it di¤cult to conceive that the tail could enter the H site ahead of the ring. Conceptually, one could imagine that histamine enters the protein via the entrance to the L site, which it then uses as a stepping stone to move into the H site. However, this seems most unlikely, considering that the L site is not conserved in RaHBP1. Moreover, the septum between the two sites would be an e¤cient barrier for histamine, let alone histamine-agarose. This suggests that entry occurs at another point, with the imidazole ring entering ¢rst (the possibility that histamine-agarose targets the variable L, rather than the conserved H sites, can be ruled out by the fact that all three HBPs are bound with similar e¤ciencies). The entrances into binding sites in L-barrels are often signposted by water molecules [21,22]. Two putative alternative entry routes, situated at either side of the LG^LH loop, are so marked in the RaHBP2 crystal. One of these alternative entrances, a gap between the LG^LH loop (in the region of Gly-126) and L^ strand F (in the region of Thr-109), would give functional signi¢cance to an unusual feature of the RaHBP2 structure, namely a break in the hydrogen bonding of the barrel. This break causes the Gstrand to be stripped away (and widens the gap with L^strand F). The residues £anking the gap are fairly well conserved among the three HBPs. A second route into the H site is via a gap between the LG^LH loop (in the region of Glu-132) and the 6-loop (in the region of Lys-37) (Fig. 5). Since residues of the latter are directly involved in the binding of histamine, this may be a more likely route than the one proposed above. A £exible, open structure in some lipocalins [11,21], the 6-loop is stabilised by internal, main-chain hydrogen bonding in RaHBP2, making it a relatively narrow ribbon. One side of the loop (residues 42^47) is highly conserved, and interacts strongly with the LC^LD loop, with which it forms multiple hydrogen bonds. This creates a gap between the other side of the 6-loop (residues 38^41) and the LG^LH loop, an opening which is further widened by a Pro-125-induced kink in the 6-loop. The side of the LG^LH loop that £anks the gap, only interacts with the rest of the barrel via two water molecules. Histamine may stabilise the position of these waters, since its amino group forms a

direct hydrogen bond with one of them. This suggests that in the apo-form of the molecule this network of water molecules may be absent and the LG^ LH loop may be a more dynamic, £exible structure, thus allowing more space for histamine to slip into the H site. 11. The L site entrance It is even less likely that histamine enters the protein via the H site to move `upstream' into the energetically less favourable L site (assuming it could by-pass the septum). Moreover, the back soaking experiments in the crystals, in which histamine is readily removed from the low-a¤nity site, without a¡ecting ligand binding to the H site [6], indicate there must exist a separate gateway between the L pocket and the exterior. A possible entrance to the L site consists of a gap between the sidechain of Asn-118 (the ¢rst residue of L-strand G) and the K2-helix at the level of Ala-23. At this position, the Cys-119^Cys-148 disul¢debridge links the G-strand to the K3-helix, thus pulling it away from the K2-helix. At the same time, the K2-helix is pulled in the other direction by a hydro-

100

gen bond (at Asp-24) with LB. The residues lying beyond this are those directly involved in the binding of histamine. Unlike the ¢rst two turns of the K2helix, the carboxyterminal turn (Val-25^Asn-27) is not hydrogen-bonded to the barrel, but instead protrudes slightly from the main structure, possibly increasing the accessibility to the entrance. 12. Histamine binding by other lipocalins Ticks are not the only blood-feeding arthropods that use lipocalins to mop up histamine at the feeding site. The nitrophorins mentioned elsewhere in this issue are haem-carrying lipocalins produced by the bloodsucking insect Rhodnius prolixus, which release nitric oxide into the feeding site and are then able to bind histamine (with a Kd of V2U1038 M). However, compared to HBPs, nitrophorins are structurally closer to traditional lipocalins. Moreover, they employ a completely di¡erent binding mechanism. Only one negatively charged sidegroup is involved in the binding of histamine by nitrophorins (Asp-30 in nitrophorin-1) through an interaction with the amino group, whereas the imidazole ring interacts with the haem moiety in the central cavity via a nitrogen^Fe bond [16,23]. Since they lack haem groups, nitric oxide binding by tick HBPs seems unlikely. Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), a vertebrate lipocalin acting as an acute phase protein, binds a wide variety of basic ligands, in addition to some neutral and acidic compounds. It has been suggested that AAG binds histamine, but this binding has never been thoroughly characterised [24]. Basic ligands apparently all bind in a similar manner to a single internal binding site in AAG, which shows little stereoselectivity [25]. Moreover, it seems that basic compounds are more ¢rmly bound after neutralisation (by deprotonation) and that hydrophobic interactions dominate high a¤nity binding to AAG [26]. 13. Conclusion Despite folding into an eight-stranded L-barrel with the typical +1 topology (and despite the structural conservation at the open end of the barrel) the

term lipocalin (`calyces for lipophilic ligands') is very much a misnomer for HBPs. Because of the extra binding site, HBPs have not only shed some of the secondary structural characteristics of traditional lipocalins, they have also lost the calyx-like appearance of other members of the family. Similarly, the pre¢x lipo- does not apply to HBPs, considering the hydrophilic nature of histamine. Thus tick HBPs are very eccentric members of the lipocalin family. Perhaps the parasitic lifestyle of ticks, which has forced invertebrate proteins to adapt to a very speci¢c vertebrate microenvironment, has contributed to this eccentricity.
