Only a few transcriptional regulatory proteins have been characterized in extremely hyperthermophilic organisms, and most function as repressors. Structural features of the NtrC1 protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus suggested that this protein functions similarly to the s54-polymerase activator DctD of Sinorhizobium meliloti. Here, we demonstrate that NtrC1 is an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP to activate initiation of transcription by s54-holoenzyme. New structural data, including small-angle solution scattering data and the crystal structure of the phosphorylated receiver domain, show that NtrC1 uses a signal transduction mechanism very similar to that of DctD to control assembly of its AAAC ATPase domain. As for DctD, the off-state of NtrC1 depends upon a tight dimer of the receiver domain to repress oligomerization of an intrinsically competent ATPase domain. Activation of NtrC1 stabilizes an alternative dimer configuration of the receiver domain that is very similar to the on-state dimers of the DctD and FixJ receiver domains. This alternative dimer appears to relieve repression of the ATPase domain by disrupting the off-state dimerization interface along the helical linker region between receiver and ATPase domains. Bacterial enhancer binding proteins typically have two linker sequences, one between N-terminal regulatory and central ATPase domains, and one between the central ATPase and C-terminal DNA binding domains. Sequence analyses reveal an intriguing correlation between the negative regulation mechanism of NtrC1 and DctD, and a structured N-terminal linker and unstructured C-terminal one; conversely, the very different, positive mechanism present in NtrC protein occurs in the context of an unstructured N-terminal linker and a structured C-terminal one. In both cases, the structured linkers significantly contribute to the stability of the off-state dimer conformation. These analyses also raise the possibility that a structured linker between N-terminal regulatory and central output domains is used frequently in regulatory proteins from hyperthermophilic organisms.

that have been characterized function as transcriptional repressors, e.g. the arginine repressor protein (ArgR) in the bacterium Thermotoga neapolitana1 and maltose-specific gene regulator (TrmB) in the archaeon Thermococcus litoralis.2 To date the only activator characterized is the Ptr2 protein of the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, which acts, in part, by recruiting TATA binding protein to the promoter.3 Here we describe enzymatic and structural properties of NtrC1, a transcriptional activator from the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus. The results that we present extend previous structural studies4 in which NtrC1 crystallized as a dimer in the inactive state and as a heptameric ring in the active state. Aquifex aeolicus grows optimally at 85 8C but can survive at 96 8C. NtrC1 is one of six putative activators of s54-holoenzyme in this organism. The s54 activator proteins are widespread among bacteria and regulate the expression of genes required for diverse physiological processes. For example, NtrC of Escherichia coli controls transcription for genes required for nitrogen metabolism, and DctD of Sinorhizobium meliloti controls transcription for genes required for the transport of dicarboxylates. NtrC1 was named after NtrC because the proteins share 60% sequence similarity;5 however, NtrC1's physiological role in the cell is unknown. Sequence homology and previous molecular structures show that NtrC1 has three domains: an N-terminal receiver domain (Pfam accession number PF00072), a central AAAC ATPase domain (Pfam PF00158), and a C-terminal DNA binding domain (Pfam PF02954). Henceforth these will be referred to as R (regulatory or receiver), C (central) and D (DNA-binding) domains. Two segments of sequence that connect the domains identified by homology are termed linkers, with L 1 denoting the segment that joins the R and C domains, and L2 the segment joining the C and D domains. Here, we show directly that NtrC1 is a response regulator that uses its AAAC ATPase domain to stimulate transcription of an open reading frame (ORF) of unknown function by s54-holoenzyme. We provide further evidence for two distinct signal transduction mechanisms between R and C domains of s54-dependent transcriptional activators, which were first revealed by comparing the function of NtrC from enteric bacteria to that of DctD from S. meliloti.6 Our present functional and structural data for the R domain of NtrC1, including solution scattering data and the crystal structure for its phosphorylated state, indicate that NtrC1 uses the same mechanism as DctD to regulate oligomerization of its C domain and hence AAAC ATPase and activation of transcription. Sequence analyses suggest that this mechanism occurs in other two-component response regulators, and that hyperthermophilic microbes use a structured linker to join the receiver and output domains more frequently than mesophilic counterparts.

Results
The AAAC ATPase domain of NtrC1 is intrinsically competent Removing the receiver domain and linker L1 from DctD strongly derepresses its ATPase domain.7 We found the same to be true for NtrC1. In a heterologous, in vivo system containing the dctAlacZ reporter gene in E. coli cultures grown at 43 8C, removal of the receiver domain and L1 linker (the C-L2-D construct) increased transcription of NtrC1 by 80-fold (Figure 1(a)). The reporter gene contained an upstream activating sequence (UAS) specific for DctD, rather than for NtrC1. Fortuitous binding to the UAS may have enhanced the in vivo activation by the C-L2-D construct of NtrC1. Further removing linker L2 and the DNA-binding domain (leaving just C) resulted in a fragment that displayed only sixfold greater transcription activity than seen for the full-length protein. Adding back the receiver domain and linker L1 to the C domain (construct R-L1-C) repressed its activity, reducing it to the background level that was seen for the fulllength protein. Even in the absence of DNA, the purified C-L2-D fragment of NtrC1 also exhibited high in vitro ATPase activity, hydrolyzing 300 mmol of ATP per minute per mmol of monomer at an optimal temperature of 82 8C (Figure 1(b)). The full-length NtrC1 (R-L1-C-L2-D construct) had no detectable ATPase activity, unless it was incubated with beryllofluoride, BeFK (Figure 1(c)). BeFK has been 3 3 shown to bind to the active site aspartate, making an excellent analogue of aspartyl-phosphate,8 and fully activating many isolated receiver domains,9 including that of NtrC1 (see below). Full-length NtrC1 had maximal activity in 7 mM Be2CC42 mM FK, with about 25% of the ATPase activity of the truncated protein. Higher concentrations (at a 1:6 ratio) were strongly inhibitory for the full-length protein (Figure 1(c)) but only modestly for the truncated C-L2-D protein (data not shown). This is likely because high fluoride ion concentration favors formation of BeF2ÿ over BeFK, and only the 4 3 latter activates receiver domains. The C-L2-D fragment, missing the receiver domain, does not require activation. Repression of the AAAC ATPase domain of NtrC1 depends upon the integrity of the receiver-L1 linker dimer interface Mutations in DctD that partially activated DctD in vivo clustered in residues of the R-L1 dimer interface. Two of these substitutions, K121E and E122K, were shown biochemically to reduce the stability of the off-state dimer.10 Analogous substitutions targeting the dimer interface (Figure 2(a)) were introduced into the ntrC1 gene and assayed in the heterologous in vivo transcription assay described above. The amount of activity was quite

low, probably because of the heterologous nature of the assay in which the reporter gene, core RNA polymerase, and sigma factors are all non-native (from S. meliloti and E. coli, not A. aeolicus). In addition, because the assays were performed in E. coli (no transcriptional assay is available in A. aeolicus), the assays could not be performed at a temperature optimal for NtrC1 ATPase activity (w70 8C).

245 and interpretation of these data, beyond the scope of this article, are being published elsewhere). The crystal structure determined for phosphorylated NtrC1 R-L1 fragment contains two protomers in the asymmetric unit, as a non-crystallographic dimer. ° The structure, using diffraction data to 3.03 A, was refined to an Rwork of 25.1% and Rfree of 28.3% (structure statistics are shown in Table 1). The phosphoryl groups on the conserved Asp51 residues were clearly evident in omit maps, with signal at the phosphate atoms greater than 15s (Figure 4(a)). The configuration of conserved residues in the active site (D7, D8, D51, T79, and K101) in both protomers was similar to that seen in other activated receiver domains (such as MgC2 =BeFK ÿ DctD,6 MgC2 =BeFK ÿ CheY,11 3 3 and phosphorylated-FixJ),12 except that the hydrogen bonding between the phosphoryl group and the amine on K101 was not apparent. Weak electron density around the CE and NZ atoms indicates that the end of this side-chain is only partially ordered and not completely constrained by hydrogen bonding with the phosphoryl group. The phosphorylated NtrC1 R-L1 domain forms a distinctly different dimer structure (Figure 4(b)) from that seen in the inactive NtrC1 R-L1-C structure (Figure 2(a) and (c)). In the phosphoprotein structure, the dimeric interface involves ° primarily a-helix 4 and b-strand 5 (900 A2) rather ° than a-helix 4, b-strand 5, and a-helix 5 (2065 A2) 4 seen in the inactive structure.

Although the activities were low, it was still sufficient to reveal partial derepression of the central ATPase domain for substitutions E107S, K114E, E117K, H118E, E124K, R129S and E131K, and possibly for E106S, N125S and K132E, but not for substitutions K92E and Y96F (Figure 2(b)). Thus, as for DctD, the ability of the NtrC1 receiver domain and L1 linker to repress assembly of its AAAC ATPase depends upon interactions of residues in the off-state dimer interface, predominantly ones in the dimer interface formed by a-helix 5. The published structure of the NtrC1 fragment R-L1-C shows additional stabilizing contacts between the R-L1 portion of one subunit and the ATPase domain of the second subunit, and contacts between the two ATPase domains (Figure 2(c)). These contacts were not addressed in this mutagenesis study. Activation of the NtrC1 and DctD R-L1 proteins induces similar structural changes in solution and in crystals H­15N correlation spectra revealed that both NtrC1 and DctD R-L1 proteins were fully converted to an active conformation by 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM BeCl2 and 30 mM NaF (data not shown). Small and wide-angle X-ray scattering data were collected for both protein fragments in the presence of 5 mM Mg2C=BeFK. Essentially super-imposable 3 scattering profiles were obtained for mid to high Q values, providing strong evidence that the activated structures of DctD R-L1 and NtrC1 R-L1 are highly similar in solution (Figure 3). Guinier plots of low Q data and ab initio structure modeling of combined low and high Q data indicated that under these solution conditions NtrC1 R-L1 is a dimer of dimers, while DctD R-L1 is a dimer; these dimer structures are very similar to the corresponding crystal structure presented below for phosphorylated NtrC1 R-L1 and previously for the beryllofluoridebound R-L1 fragment of DctD6 (detailed presentation

putative promoter, potentially a regulatory protein binding site. This segment is predicted to encode a strong bend in the DNA, as was previously seen to be a feature of the dctA UAS of Rhizobium leguminosarum.13 A 319 base-pair fragment corresponding to residues K251 to C68 of the putative Aq_1119 promoter was used in gel mobility-shift assays to evaluate in vitro binding. A clear shift was observed that saturated with 10 nM or less NtrC1 dimer (data not shown). DNaseI footprinting was performed under the same conditions, revealing sequence-specific binding to the tandem dyad repeats (Figure 5(b)). Quantitative analyses of the footprints (Figure 5(c)) revealed that the promoter proximal site B, which has stronger dyad symmetry, also has higher apparent affinity than the promoter distal site A (apparent KD values (and 67% confidence intervals) were 0.7 (0.5, 1.0) and 4.8 (4.1, 5.8) nM, respectively). Additional studies with variant binding sites will be required to determine if these binding events have either positive or negative cooperativity. Linker sequence motifs correlate with activation mechanism A combination of structural and biochemical data available for NtrC versus DctD and NtrC1 indicate that the linker regions in the proteins contain sequences that correlate with specific aspects of function. First, the L1-linker between R and C domains in NtrC seems to serve as a flexible tether.14 The NtrC receiver domain expressed alone is monomeric. However, in the off states of DctD and NtrC1 the receiver domains are dimeric (or dimers of dimers) and the N-terminal part of L1 is a helical extension of a-helix 5 of the receiver domain. a-Helix 5 forms a pseudo coiled coil (crossed helical pair) that is a major component of the receiver domain dimerization interface, and this interface is responsible for holding the C domains in an inactive, face to face configuration.4 Combined results of secondary structure and coiled coil prediction programs correctly identify this element in the sequences of DctD and NtrC1, and indicate that it is not present in NtrC (Figure 6). The pseudo coiled coil structure is key to the regulatory function in DctD and NtrC1, and its presence appears to be a predictor of regulatory mechanism. The second region of sequence that correlates with regulatory mechanism is in L2, the linker between the end of the ATPase domain and the start of the DNA-binding domain. The DNA-binding domains of DctD, NtrC1 and NtrC all contain predicted C-terminal helix-turn-helix motifs that are expected to be responsible for the specific interactions in DNA binding. NMR data on the L2-D portion of NtrC showed that the N-terminal part of L2 (residues D380 to P399) is a very flexible random coil, whereas the C-terminal part of L2 is structured, forming two helices that are an integral part of the intermolecular interface in the dimeric DNA-binding domain. This helical segment is

of A. aeolicus was scanned for s 54-dependent promoters. A single high-scoring site was identified, suggesting that transcription starts 100 basepairs downstream from the end of the ntrC1 coding region (Figure 5(a)). This suggests that the annotation of this region of the genome is incorrect. Coding region Aq_1119 begins at position K47 relative to the predicted transcription start site; however, 14 base-pairs downstream of the predicted transcription start site is an ATG codon that is preceded by a potential ribosome-binding site. If the latter is the correct translation start site, this would reduce the length of ORF Aq_1119 by 21 amino acid residues. Neighboring partial and nearly complete dyad symmetric elements were noted to span base-pairs K99 to K62 relative to the

Transcriptional Activator from a Hyperthermophile

247 homologous to the factor for inversion stimulation protein, Fis, in both sequence15 and structure.16 These two helices in L2 are predicted well by secondary structure prediction programs. In stark contrast, for DctD and NtrC1 the L2 region is much shorter and is predicted to have a non-structured segment, followed by a single helix that has no homology to the dimerization helices of NtrC/Fis (Figure 6). Consistent with secondary structure analysis, the DNA-binding domain of NtrC1 is not a strong dimer like NtrC (A.E.M. & D.E.W., unpublished results). Thus, the nature of L2, recognizable from sequence, is a predictor for structure and dimerization of the DNA-binding domain. Many sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins in bacteria, including the s54 activators, dimerize and recognize pseudo-palindromic DNA sequences. Either the receiver domain or the DNA-binding domain can act as a primary dimerization determinant, through recognizable sequence motifs as discussed above. There is only a need for one dimerization element in the protein, and hence, not surprisingly, the presence of the pseudo coiled coil in L1 is anticorrelated with the presence of the extended linker and extra helix in L2. For this reason, joint analysis of the two linker sequences should provide the most reliable predictor of the behavior in other activators.

Discussion
NtrC1 is an ATPase that stimulates transcription Structural studies of NtrC1 (from a hyperthermophile) were initiated to complement work on NtrC (from a mesophile). Homology of NtrC1 to NtrC throughout the three functional domains, and the presence of a s54 homolog in A. aeolicus, strongly suggested that NtrC1 is a transcriptional activator. Structures of the R-L1-C and C domains of NtrC1 reported recently4 indicated that its regulatory mechanism is distinct from that of NtrC. The positions of the receiver domains in the R-L1-C structure strongly suggested a mechanistic analogy to DctD. The biochemical and structural studies presented here verify this analogy. Prior studies revealed two distinct signal transduction mechanisms for regulating oligomerization of the AAAC ATPase domain that is present in s54 regulators. In "positive" regulation as seen with NtrC of enteric bacteria, phosphorylation of the receiver domain brings about a new interaction with the ATPase domain, leading to assembly of the active oligomer. In contrast, in "negative" regulation as seen with DctD, the "off-state" receiver domains stabilize an inactive state of the ATPase. Phosphorylation of the receiver domains leads to a rearrangement that releases the ATPases so that they can assemble the

248 oligomer. Figure 7(a) shows a schematic illustration of the two mechanisms emphasizing their positive and negative natures. This difference in mechanism leads to a fundamental difference in the behavior of the proteins when the receiver domains are deleted: this form of NtrC is not active under any conditions, whereas the corresponding form of DctD has been shown to be constitutively active. The structure of the R-L1-C construct of NtrC1 clearly showed how the receiver domains could hold the ATPase domains in an inactive conformation, very likely the same mechanism as in DctD. In DctD amino acid changes that destabilize the pseudo coiled coil interface between the inactive state receiver domains lead to partial activity. Both solution (B.T.N., unpublished results) and crystal structures of the BeFK-activated 3 DctD receiver domain indicated that the dimer rearranged upon activation. The data presented in Figures 1 and 2 show that the behavior of NtrC1 is exactly analogous to that of DctD. Genetic deletion of the receiver domain leads to constitutive transcriptional activity from a s54 promoter driving a reporter gene. Furthermore, amino acid changes analogous to those made in the pseudo coiled coil of DctD lead to weak but clear transcriptional activity. These observations verify that NtrC1 is negatively regulated, and that the pseudo coiled coil region does play a significant role in maintaining the off state. Our results show clearly that NtrC1, like DctD, has an intrinsically competent central domain with constitutively active ATPase activity in vitro and transcriptional activity in vivo. Thus, as predicted from sequence analysis and recent structural studies, the NtrC1 receiver domain and L1 linker are responsible for negatively regulating the activity

of the central AAAC ATPase domain. Further, the truncated NtrC1 fragment (C-L2-D) has a similar ATPase activity at 82 8C (300 mmol of ATP per minute per mmol of monomer) as the ATPase activity at 37 8C of the truncated DctD fragment (220 mmol of ATP per minute per mM monomer in the absence of DNA and 320 mmol of ATP per minute per mmol of monomer in the presence of DNA).17,18 In contrast, the NtrC protein has significantly lower ATPase activity than NtrC1 and DctD. When activated, NtrC hydrolyzes w4 mmol of ATP per minute per mmol of monomer in the absence of DNA19 and w20 mmol per minute per mM monomer in the presence of DNA.20 The active receiver domains of NtrC1 and DctD are structurally similar The crystal structure of phosphorylated NtrC1 R-L1 shown in Figure 4 again reinforces the similarity of NtrC1 to DctD, and essentially removes ambiguity about the structural nature of the activated dimer of DctD R-L1. The crystal lattice of the Mg2C=BeFK-bound DctD RL1 fragment 3 contained four different dimer configurations.6 Solution structures derived from small-angle scattering data (that we report elsewhere) are inconsistent with two of the four possible dimer configurations, indicating that one of the remaining two structures is the physiologically relevant one. The phosphorylated NtrC1 dimer superimposes well with only one of the ° Mg2C=BeFK-DctD dimers (r.m.s.d. w 1.3 A for a 3 superposition of the first 133 amino acid residues of active DctD and NtrC1), as well as to the dimer of phosphorylated FixJ R fragment (Figure 7(b)).

In activated NtrC the DNA-binding domain is hidden underneath the hexamer ring. For DctD and NtrC1, no information is available to define the position of DNA-binding domains. Models were built using published structures: for NtrC fragments R (off-state PDB 1KRW, on-state 1KRX) and L2-D (PDB entry 1NTC); and for NtrC1 and DctD fragment R of NtrC1 (this work), and fragments R-L1-C (1NY5) and L1-C (1NY6) of NtrC1, and R-L1 of DctD (off 1L5Y, on 1L5Z).

250 The rearrangement of the NtrC1 receiver domain upon activation has features related to those seen in other proteins of this class.4,6,11,12,21,22 A key element is a change in position of the conserved Thr (residue 79 in NtrC1) to move the side-chain OH toward the active site to hydrogen bond to the phosphate. This movement changes the packing around the T79 side-chain methyl as well, and the conserved aromatic on b-strand 5 (F98 in NtrC1) then moves to a more deeply buried position that results in a repositioning of the top of helix 4, the top of strand b-strand 5, the loop between b-strand 5 and a-helix 5, and translation of a-helix 5 down along its helical axis. These rearrangements perturb the original dimerization interface between the two receiver domains, thus destabilizing it. These changes are very similar to those deduced for DctD.6 Molecular details of the subunit interfaces for these activated receiver domain homodimers are strikingly similar (Figure 7(c)). The activated interface is created by opening a hydrophobic pocket at the N-terminal end of a-helix 4 and b-strand 5. A specific T-G-X-G-X-Hyd-X3-Hyd-X2-Hyd motif, in which I84, V88 and M91 are the three hydrophobic residues (Figure 7(c)), described in more detail below), is frequently used in this interface. Conservation in this region has been discussed previously in the context of FixJ.12 As summarized in Figure 7(a), the relative orientations of the L1 helices between the receiver domain and central ATPase domain in the homodimer change drastically upon phosphorylation. In the inactive dimer of NtrC1 R-L1-C, the linker segments (the C-terminal end of a-helix 5) form a pair of crossed helices, which we found to be crucial in repressing ATPase activity. In the active dimer of NtrC1 R-L1, these helical segments are no longer in contact but rather are pointed away from each other. In one protomer, the end of the L1 segment makes crystal packing contacts with another symmetry-related molecule. Electron density is present for the entire length of this linker region. In the other protomer, the L1 segment is not restrained by crystal packing contacts, and residues after amino acid residue 125 have extremely weak electron density and, hence, are difficult to model. The lack of electron density in this region suggests that the linker segment is intrinsically flexible in the phosphorylated NtrC1 R-L1 dimer. It will be interesting to determine if the L1 linker segment is still flexible when the central ATPase is attached to its C terminus. NtrC1 probably regulates Aq_1119 Genes are tightly packed in the A. aeolicus genome.5 The location of the putative UAS for NtrC1 is consistent with such packing because it is found immediately downstream of the termination codon of the ntrC1 gene. The promoter proximal edge of the NtrC1 binding sites is at K62 relative to the putative promoter. Based on studies of the NtrC protein of mesophilic bacteria, this putative enhancer-binding element for NtrC1 appears to be located

too close to the s54 promoter. In previous studies,23 the two high-affinity sites of the NtrC UAS functioned quite well when the proximal edge was placed K74 to K124 base-pairs upstream of the glnA promoter but gave only 25% and !10% function when it was placed at positions K69 and K63. If the sites we have identified immediately downstream of the ntrC1 gene are bona fide promoter and enhancer elements, then other features, such as the higher ATPase activity and putative intrinsic bend in the DNA, might compensate for the apparent disadvantage arising from the close proximity. Also, high temperature may impart additional flexibility in DNA, which may facilitate looping between the UAS bound by NtrC1 and the promoter bound by s54-RNA polymerase. At this point it is unclear whether NtrC1 regulates the expression of just one gene in the A.aeolicus genome or more that have not been identified. There are no other predicted s54-dependent promoters that contain this apparently regulatory DNA-binding element. Sequences in L1 and L2 allow classification of regulatory mechanism Sequence comparisons used in conjunction with the available structural data reveal two sequence motifs that distinguish between the positive and negative regulatory mechanisms for s54 activators. First, the L1 region of NtrC is unstructured: its sequence is consistent with this, yielding no secondary structure prediction. The equivalent regions of DctD and NtrC1 are helical extensions of the C-terminal a-helix 5 of the receiver domain, forming pseudo coiled coil in the context of the dimer. Programs do correctly predict the secondary structure and the nature of the structure for the L1 regions of these proteins (Figure 6). The L2 region connecting the C and D domains similarly shows differences in length and predicted secondary structure that correlate with dimerization of the DNA-binding domains. The presence of dimerization interactions in the L1 and L2 regions is anticorrelated, which makes sense in light of the mechanisms of regulation in these proteins. The sequence of NtrC4 from A. aeolicus, a homolog of NtrC1, gives no helix or coiled coil prediction in L1, but does have a longer L2 region with predicted helical structure. Preliminary data are consistent with the prediction that the receiver domain from this protein is monomeric, whereas the DNAbinding domain is clearly a stable dimer. It is interesting to examine linker sequences that join receiver and output domains in other s54 activators with two-component response regulator receiver domains to classify their mechanisms. Such linker regions also appear to be relevant for other s54-dependent activators that are regulated by other types of domains. For example, in one subgroup of activator proteins, such as XylR and DmpR from Pseudomonas, the AAAC ATPase is controlled by a unique regulator domain that binds and responds

Transcriptional Activator from a Hyperthermophile

directly to small effector molecules.24 Mutational studies with both DmpR and XylR demonstrate that the integrity of the coiled coil linker between the regulator and ATPase domains, as in DctD, is critical for repressing ATPase and transcriptional activity in the absence of the signaling molecule.25,26 A. aeolicus has six predicted s54-dependent activators: three controlled by two-component receiver domains, two by GAF domains (Pfam accession number PF01590), and one by two PAS domains (Pfam accession number PF00989). Four of the six activators are predicted to have coiled coil or pseudo coiled coil linkers (Figure 8), as seen in DctD and NtrC1. It was previously noted that only about 4.5% of all two-component response regulators are predicted to have such structured linkers.10 However, in that survey the majority of proteins sampled were from mesophilic bacteria. When we analyze response regulators from extremely hyperthermophilic organisms we find that about 10% (14/148) are predicted to have such structured linkers joining receiver and Pfam domains HD, HD-GYD, OmpR, PAS, GAF, HisKA, HATPase, HtH-ICLR, diacid-rec, HtH-AraC, GGDEF and trans_reg_C as well as uncharacterized ones. An additional region that seems to have functionally relevant conserved sequences is in the a-helix 4 and b-strand 5 surfaces of the receiver domains. Phosphorylation of the NtrC and DctD/NtrC1 receiver domains leads to significantly different changes in this signaling surface. These differences underlie the two distinct mechanisms of linking phosphorylation with ring assembly of the central ATPase domain. In NtrC, activation causes a register shift in a-helix 4 creating a new binding surface for interaction with the N-terminal portion of the central ATPase domain (residues 134­160).21,27,28 Recent studies using SAXS/WAXS and negative staining electron microscopy (B.T.N. & S. De Carlo, unpublished results) show that the receiver domain packs against the ATPase domain on the outside of a hexamer ring. In DctD, activation induces smaller changes in the signaling surface of the receiver domain that lead to a new homodimer interface. The repositioning of the loops between b-strand 3 and a-helix 4, and a-helix 4 and b-strand 5 of the receiver domain opens a hydrophobic pocket that permits the parallel stacking of hydrophobic side-chains from two subunits to form a stable on-state dimer.6 These features appear to depend upon specific glycine and hydrophobic residues that immediately follow the highly conserved threonine or serine of the triggering mechanism (residues T83­I95 of DctD). The motif:

Figure 8. Predicted domain architecture for the six s54-dependent activators of A. aeolicus. Four of the six regulators are predicted to use a coiled coil linker L1 (cc) to regulate assembly of the central AAAC ATPase (C) domains. L1 variously joins two component receiver (R) or GAF regulatory domains with the C domains. Cterminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domains (D) are also shown.

is present in the NtrC1 receiver domain, and in those of 134 response regulators of the 5676 that were in the Pfam database at the time of this study (2.36% of the total. An additional 197 sequences (3.5% of the total) match the motif if the first or second glycine is allowed to be alanine, forming the more relaxed motif. Among these regulators are NtrC1 of A. aeolicus; DctD, FixJ and ActR of S. meliloti; DctD of R. leguminosarum; DctR and RegA of Rhodobacteria; FixJ and NodW of Bradyrhizobium japonicum; FixJ of Azotobacter (NtrX has serine instead of threonine in position 1); PgtA and SilR of Salmonella typhimurium; CusR of Escherichia coli; PilR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; LuxO of Vibrio; SisR of Borrelia bergdorferi; CutR of Streptomyces coelicolor A3; and, many unstudied open reading frames. This and previous studies6,12 show that activation stabilizes essentially identical dimer configurations of the receiver domains of NtrC1, DctD and FixJ. These sequence analyses support the hypothesis that NtrC1 and DctD function similarly, and suggest that signal transduction occurs in a like manner in other regulatory proteins (of unknown structure) that also possess the appropriate sequence motifs. A helical L1 linker connecting the regulator domain to its output domain predicts an off-state configuration similar to DctD and NtrC1. The presence of

252 this helix also suggests a tight structural coupling between regulatory and output domains in the offstate, as seen previously for DctD and now for NtrC1. In the case of s54 transcriptional activators, this helix appears to be indicative of negative regulation by the regulatory domain. The presence of the motif T-G-X-Hyd-G-X-Hyd-X-X-X-Hyd-X-XHyd in a-helix 4 of a receiver domain suggests an on-state dimer similar to DctD, FixJ, and NtrC1.

Transcriptional Activator from a Hyperthermophile

Conclusions
Here, we present one of the first functional studies of a transcriptional activator from a hyperthermophilic organism. Our results demonstrate the conservation or lateral transfer between mesophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria of a signal transduction mechanism used to control the functional state of s54 transcriptional activators. The receiver domain and linker L1 of NtrC1 from the hyperthermophilic A. aeolicus negatively regulates the central AAAC ATPase with the same basic mechanism used by the receiver domain of DctD from the mesophilic S. meliloti. Despite inheriting a similar interaction between receiver and ATPase domains, the DNA binding specificities have evolved to target genes affecting different physiological needs of the respective cells. Characteristic features of both the off and on-states of the conserved mechanism can be used to predict aspects of signal transduction for additional twocomponent response regulators and other bacterial enhancer-binding proteins that are not controlled by two-component receiver domains.

Materials and Methods
Molecular biology Gel mobility-shift assays and DNaseI footprints were performed largely as described by Sojda et al.13 Oligonucleotides were used to amplify a 319 base-pair fragment from bases 781,309 to 781,628 of the A. aeolicus genome that was cloned into the SmaI site of the vector pUC18. Ends created by digestion with the BamHI restriction endonuclease at a site 241 base-pairs upstream of a putative s54-dependent promoter were labeled using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase. Protein and DNA were prebound for 45 min at 37 8C in buffer containing Tris­HCl (20 mM, pH 8.2), KCl (200 mM), and glycerol (12%, v/v) prior to either (a) loading in native 5% (w/v) gels for electrophoresis in TBE buffer, or (b) digestion with 250-fold diluted DNaseI (Promega) for 30 s at 37 8C. Digestions were quenched by the addition of 700 ml of stop solution (645 ml of ethanol; 5 ml of tRNA, 1 mg/ml; 50 ml of saturated ammonium acetate). DNA was precipitated at K80 8C overnight, washed with 70% (v/v) ethanol, dried, dissolved in loading buffer and electrophoresed in denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Labeled DNA fragments were visualized using phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Non-linear, global regression analyses were performed using NONLIN as described.29 In vivo transcription assays used a transla-

tional fusion of S. meliloti dctA and E. coli lacZ that was carried on the broad host range vector pRK290.30 The reporter gene was introduced into the BL21/DE3/pLysS strain of E. coli (Novagen) for testing transcription activation by NtrC1 and recombinant versions of it that were expressed at 43 8C in overnight cultures at background levels (no IPTG added) from pET21a (Novagen) constructions. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The extracts were then cleared by centrifugation and subjected to b-galactosidase assays as described.30 Mutations were introduced into DNA using a commercial kit (QuickChange, Stratagene), and the entire gene for each construct was confirmed by sequence of at least one strand (Penn State Nucleic Acid Facility). To make the C-L2-D construct, an NdeI site was placed before residue 137 and joined with the pET vector to remove the receiver domain and linker L1. To make the R-L1 and R-L1-C constructs, a TAA stop codon was introduced before residue 137 and after residue 389, respectively. The following amino acid substitutions were created: K92E (AAA/GAA), Y96F (TAC/TTT), E106S (GAA/AGC), E107S (GAA/AGC), K114E (AAG/ GAA), E117K (GAA/AAA), H118E (CAC/GAA), E124K (GAA/AAA), N125S (AAC/AGC), R129S (AGA/AGC), E131K (GAA/AAA) and K132E (AAG/GAA). For ATPase assays, 135 ml reactions containing 2 mM NtrC1 protein diluted into reaction buffer (50 mM Hepes (pH 6.9), 8 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM potassium acetate) were pre-incubated for 3 min at 20 8C to 85 8C prior to the addition of 15 ml of ATP (4 mM final concentration, containing trace amounts of [g-32P]ATP, NEN-Perkin Elmer). At various times, 5 ml samples were quenched in 20 ml of 2 M HCl, to which 20 ml of chloroform and 13 ml of 2 M NaOH plus 3 M Tris base were added to return the solution to a neutral pH. The samples were then vortex mixed by and phaseseparated by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 min. After samples were collected, 1 ml aliquots were spotted onto a PEI cellulose TLC plate and, after drying, developed to separate ATP and Pi (buffer: 0.7 M boric acid, 0.4 M K2HPO4). Results were quantified using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Protein purification Proteins were expressed in 20 l fermentations in a modified terrific broth containing yeast extract (40 g/l), Tryptone (20 g/l), glycerol (30 g/l), NaH2PO4$H2O (8 g/l), K2HPO4 (7 g/l) and antifoam polypropylene glycol 2000 (0.5 ml/l) or in 1 l cultures of BioExpress medium (Cambridge Isotopes Lab) for 15N-labeling. Cells, resuspended in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, were lysed by sonication and cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was heated for 30 min at 75 8C and cleared by centrifugation. Proteins were further purified by chromatography on Co-NTA, Q-Sepharose or S-Sepharose resins. NtrC1 proteins were either used immediately, dialyzed to 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate before subsequent lyophilization and rehydration when needed (R-L1), or thawed from aliquots containing glycerol (30%; C-L2-D, R-L1-C, R-L1-C-L2-D) that were stored at K80 8C. Purity of proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE. All proteins were centrifuged and passed through 0.1 mm pore size Anotop filter (Whatman) before data analysis.

amino acid residues of the inactive NtrC1 R-L1-C monomer (PDB accession number 1NY5). Refinement was performed with CNS, using 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry in the initial stages. Electron density for the linker domain L1 (amino acid residues 124­133) and first eight residues of the His-tag (modeled as a polyalanine backbone) was visible in only one monomer. This region was modeled in O,40 and the aspartyl phosphate residues on both protomers were built with CNS.

H­15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra. Data were collected on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer and analyzed with the software NMRPipe.31 NtrC1 R-L1 (w750 mM monomer equivalents) was fully activated by 1 mM BeCl2 and 7 mM NaF. Static X-ray and dynamic light-scattering Small and wide-angle X-ray (SAXS or WAXS) experiments were conducted on the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT) undulator beamline 18-ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.32 DctD and NtrC1 R-L1 solutions contained approximately 10 mg/ml of protein in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEp) (pH 7.75) with or without 5 mM BeCl2 and 40 mM NaF. The NtrC1 R-L1 solutions were incubated overnight at room temperature to ensure full reduction of disulfide bonds, and a BeFK titration (from 10 mM to 10 mM BeFK) 3 3 was followed by SAXS to ensure full activation. For collection of scattering data, samples were exposed to focused X-rays (12 keV and 2!1013 photons/s flux) for an average of 0.58(G0.08) s. Two-dimensional scattering patterns were obtained by using a 5 cm!9 cm chargecoupled device (CCD) detector33 at a specimen to detector distance of 2.78 m (SAXS) or 0.24 m (WAXS). Radiation damage was minimized by including 10 mM TCEP in the sample solutions and by pumping them through a 1.5 mm quartz capillary at 12.5 ml/s.34 Recordings were repeated five times. Scattering intensity profiles over the ° ° Q range from 0.007 AK1 to 1.400 AK1 were calculated from radial averaging of the 2D scattering patterns using macros written by the APS staff for IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Inc). Scattering profiles from protein plus buffer and from buffer alone were scaled using incident flux values integrated over the exposure time. Protein scattering profiles were then obtained by subtracting the average of five buffer profiles from the average of five profiles of buffer plus protein. The PRIMUS program35 was used to merge SAXS and WAXS scattering data. Crystallography Lyophilized powder of the NtrC1 R-L1 fragment (residues 2­133 plus C-terminal His-tag KLAAAL EHHHHHH) was dissolved in 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl, 5 mM acetyl phosphate, and 10 mM TCEP (pH 7.75) to a final protein concentration of 35 mg/ml. To activate the receiver domain, the protein solution was incubated at 37 8C for 1 h. Crystals were grown at 4 8C using the hanging-drop technique. An equal volume of the protein solution was mixed with the reservoir solution (8.5­10% (v/v) PEG-3350, 350 mM NH4Cl, 5% glycerol; 125 mM citric acid, pH 5.5) and left at 4 8C for about 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min, and 2­5 ml drops were placed on siliconized cover-slips. Hexagonal rodlike crystals appeared after three days. Crystals were incubated overnight sequentially in reservoir solution plus 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% glycerol, then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. These crystals had space group P3121 ° ° with unit cell dimensions aZbZ91.52 A, cZ130.94 A; aZ 908, bZ908, gZ1208 and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data were collected at beam line 8.3.1 of the ° Advanced Light Source (1.08 rotation per image 1.1 A wavelength). Data were processed and scaled with MOSFLM36 and the CCP4 program suite37 using the ELVES interface.38 Phases were initially obtained by molecular replacement with CNS39 using the first 124

Sequence analyses Secondary structures and coiled coils were predicted using the programs PredictProtein,41 Coils,42 PerCoil,43 and MultiCoil.44 The s54-dependent activators listed in the Pfam database45 at the time of the study were manually sorted to identify the signal-surface motif TGXGXHydX3HydX2Hyd (XZany amino acid, HydZ hydrophobic), or relaxed versions of it in which one of the two glycine residues was allowed to be alanine. Pair-wise sequence alignments were created using BLAST46 as implemented at the NCBI website. Promoter searches were conducted using SEQSCAN, as implemented in PROMSCAN.
