Foot-and-mouth-disease virus antigens - comprising peptides with amino acid sequence of viral protein antigenic sites
Wellcome Eur 105-481; 18 April 1984 mutans group I serotype C spp. The antigen proteins are present on the cell walls and remain associated with the cell walls after they have been boiled with sodium dodecyl sulphate for 20 min. They have M W of about 29 000 and an isoelectric point of 4.1-4.5. The antigenic preparation may be used as a vaccine or be used to prepare antibodies to protect against dental caries. The antigen occurs in the culture filtrate of cell extract and may be readily purified from these sources e.g, by fractional ammonium sulphate precipitation and/or affinity chromatography on immobilized antibody. 078-84

Novel antigenic peptides effective in stimulating immunity to foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) are described. The new peptides have the amino acid sequence of the antigenic site VP1 of a viral protein from serotypes A24 Cruzeino, C3 lndaial or O1 BFS or fragments or derivatives of such sequences. Particularly the peptides correspond to amino acid sequences 42-61.79-85, 95-102, 129-160, 170-176 and 193-204 and fragments thereof; regions 42-61 and 129-160 (or 162) and fragments thereof are particularly of interest. The peptides may be prepared by peptide synthesis, cleavage of larger peptides or proteins, or by culturing host organisms transformed with recombinant DNA, The recombinant DNA is double stranded and comprises a sequence coding for the peptides, a cloning vehicle DNA sequence and an initiator and terminator sequence for expression of the DNA. The peptides can be used to prepare vaccines and used in the prophylaxis of FMDV. 075-84 Peptide-eontaining compounds containing early summer meningoencephalitis (ESME) virus antigenic determinants and monoclonai antibodies against the antigen, for use in preparing vaccines effective against ESME viral infections

Hepatitis B virus surface antigen preparation, recombinant SV40 virus and hepatitis virus DNA plasmid vector construction gene transmission monkey kidney cell culture; vaccine preparation
US !)~Tt ltealth-Ituman-Ser~: US 4,442,205; 10 April 1984

Peptides and peptide-containing compounds (I) containing one or more antigenic determinant(s) of early summer meningoencephalitis (ESME) virus are new and can be characterized by their reactivity against the new monoclonal antibodies 4D9, 1B3, 5D6 and 2E7. These antibodies are defined by protective activity in passive mice protection and/or virus neutralizing effect. (I) Can be used in the preparation of vaccines against early summer meningoencephalitis viral infections and the antibodies used in the determination and identification of (i). (I) is prepared by enzymatic or chemical fragmentation of ESME virus glycoproteins or by synthesis from the corresponding amino acids. The antibodies can be prepared by fusing spleen cells from mice immunized against ESME, with mouse myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. The hybridomas secreting the antibodies are then cloned. An example is given of preparation of (I) by enzymatic fragmentation of ESME glycoprotein using trypsin and alpha-chromotrypsin. 076-84 Temperature-sensitive cattle viral diarrhoea vaccine, by mutagenesis of BDV strains with nitrous acid and isolation of a strain which has reduced growth capacity at 39.5°C SK+ I"-RIT Eur 106-831:25 April 1984 Live vi.Iccine against cattle diarrhoea virus (BI)V) (mucosal disease) is new and contains an effective quantity of a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of BDV. This vaccine avoids the risk of post-vaccinal complications encountered with the known living vaccines, by using a ts strain with a limited capacity for replication at the body temperature of the animal. The modified viral strains are prepared by mutagenesis with chemical mutagenic agents, especially nitrous acid. The mutant strains produced are cultivated at 35 and 39.5°C, to isolate strains which at 39.50(_` have a growth opacity of about 3 log~oless than at 35°C. The effective dose of the vaccine is at least 1(100-100000 TCIDso (infectious dose in tissue culture). Mutants may also be obtained by placing BDV with nitrous acid in aqueous buffer at pH 5-6 for 1-5 rain. The vaccine may be combined with another live vaccine of cattle respiratory virus type, e.g. cattle syncytial-respiratory visu. 077-84 Dental caries vaccine preparation, Streptococcus mutans antigen preparation
Sect. Soc Serv. UK US 4,442,085; 10 April 1984

Process for the production of hepatitis B surface antigen (Ag) is described. It comprises first digesting hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and an Escherichia coli plasmick pBR322, with BamHI and ligating the mixture to produce a recombinant. This is cleaved with BamHI to recover a 1350 bp DNA fragment containing the region coding for Ag. Separately, a recombinant pBR322-SV40 is prepared by ligating a BamHI-EcoRl digest of pBR322 and SV40. This is cleaved with BamHl and the 1350 bp fragment ligated to form a double recombinant pBR322-SV40-HBV. This is cleaved with Haell to give 4950 bp linear SV40-HBV molecules. Monkey kidney cells are infected with the latter and SV40 temperature sensitive early gene mutant helper virus. The transformed cell cultures produce Ag which can be obtained and used in vaccine preparations. 079-84 Neisseria gonorrhoeae vaccine containing pili fragments instead of whole pilus
US I kTt. Itealth-Ituman-Serv. US 4,443,431; 17 April 1984 Neisseriagonorrhoeae vaccine consists ofa CNI fragment which is the largest obtained by cleavage of purified pili protein at the methionine residues with an amino acid sequence different from that of other fragments. The vaccine gives protection against a wide range of N. gonorrhoeae strains. Pili obtained from N. gonorrhoeae were reduced with dithiothreitol, carboxymethylated with iodacetic acid and cleaved at the methionine groups with CNBr. After 20 h in the dark the reaction mixture was diluted with water and iyophilized. The preparation was dissolved in urea, Tris buffer and HCI at pH 7 and passed through a column of Sephadex G-75. The major polypeptide fraction was that containing CNI and others were designated CNII and CNIII. Rabbits immunized with CNI fragments of pili were found to produce 100 times the antibody that whole intact pili would have produced. 080-84

Animal vaccine against eolibacillosis preparation, antigen-bearing Escherichia coli strain culture
InsL NaL Rech. Agron US 4,443,547; 17 April 1984

Vaccine against colibacillosis contains antigens prepared from novel strains of Escherichia coil (Y+, 31A+ and 47A+) and the known K99 antigen. Theb2 coil strains are separately grown in a culture medium containing (in g/I) agar 10-20, amino acids (peptone) 1-5, glucose 1-5, aspartic acid 0.4, sodium deoxycholate 0-2, yeast extract 0- I, and mineral salts. After incubation at 37°C, the bacteria are collected from the surface of the agar. The bacteria are inactivated by chemical means, e.g., by formaldehyde treatment, or by physical means, e.g,, by gamma irradiation. The vaccine may be applied to cows before giving birth for the protection of newborn calves against diarrhoea. 081-84 Antigenic polypeptide for vaccination against entero virus especially polio and for diagnosis
