Introduction. The RAD gene of Antirrhinum majus encodes a single-repeat MYB transcription factor that is implicated in the control of floral asymmetry. Herein we present the crystal structure of the MYB domain of the RAD protein determined using the anomalous signal of ∞ iodide and refined to a resolution of 1.9 A. This constitutes the first X-ray structure of a single-repeat MYB protein. The structure conforms to the three-helix bundle fold of the canonical MYB domain, although the third helix is notably longer. Several developmental genes have been identified in Antirrhinum majus (garden snapdragon) that are implicated in the control of asymmetric floral architecture.1,2 Sequence analysis suggests that two of these genes, RADIALIS (RAD) and DIVARICATA (DIV), encode putative MYB transcription factors, this being consistent with their proposed signaling roles. MYB transcription factors are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, most notably in plants,3 and contain one or more copies of the so-called MYB DNAbinding domain.4 MYB domains are approximately 50 residues in length, highly variable in sequence, but are often characterized by three regularly spaced Trp residues.5 MYB proteins can be split into three subfamilies depending on whether they have one, two or three imperfect repeats of the MYB domain.6,7 Most MYB proteins from vertebrates consist of three imperfect repeats (R1, R2, and R3), but plants contain large numbers of two repeat (R2 and R3) MYBs.3 In some cases, however, only one MYB-like domain is present.8≠14 The DIV protein contains two MYB-like domains, whilst the RAD protein contains only one. The latter is closely related in sequence to the N-terminal MYB domain of DIV, suggesting that RAD may have evolved through a C-terminal deletion of a DIV-like ancestral protein.1 RAD promotes dorsal identity of the flower, whereas DIV promotes ventral identity.15,16 It is thought that RAD is activated in the dorsal region of the developing flower, which then inhibits the activity of DIV, by either competitively binding to DIV's target DNA sequences or to proteins that interact with DIV.1 So far, DNA binding functions for both RAD and DIV have yet to be demonstrated experimentally, and the possibility

exists that they only bind to DNA as complexes with other proteins. To date, there are relatively few structures of MYB proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB),17 despite their prevalence in nature, possibly reflecting inherent problems in over expressing and crystallizing this family of proteins. Moreover, the majority of known structures have been determined using NMR rather than X-ray crystallography. In this article, we report the crystal structure determination of an 8 kDa fragment of the 10.8 kDa RAD protein from Antirrhinum majus that encompasses the entire MYB domain and was determined using the anomalous signal of iodide from X-ray data collected in-house. Materials and Methods. The detailed procedures for the overproduction of the A. majus RAD protein and the preparation and crystallization of the 8 kDa proteolytic fragment have been described previously.18 Briefly, a fragment comprising residues 6≠74 of the 93-residue native RAD sequence was crystallized by vapor diffusion from 2.8M ammonium sulphate in 100 mM CHES buffer pH 9.5. Crystals conformed to space group P41212 (or P43212), with approximate cell parameters of a º b º ∞ ∞ 45 A and c º 72 A. This gave a crystal packing parame∞ 3 Da¿1 corresponding to an estimated ter (VM) of 2.3 A solvent content of 46% for a single copy of the fragment in the asymmetric unit. For cryogenic data collection, the crystals required careful cryoprotection with an osmolality-matched19 solution of 0.52M ammonium sulGrant sponsor: BBSRC.

phate, 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol in 100 mM CHES pH 9.5, in order to retain their original symmetry and diffraction quality.18 We had previously established that there were no suitable candidates for molecular replacement search models in the PDB, and thus structure solution would require isomorphous replacement methods.18 A search for suitable derivatives using standard heavy-atom compounds proved to be unsuccessful (data not shown), but this was not too surprising since the sequence of the 8 kDa RAD fragment contained no Cys residues and only a single His. Moreover, selenomethionine incorporation would require mutagenesis, as the sequence was also devoid of Met residues. We therefore opted to use high concentrations of halide ions, as recommended by Dauter,20 specifically iodide, due to its significant anomalous signal at a ∞ wavelength of 1.542 A.21 In this study, two X-ray datasets were collected, a native and an iodide derivative. Crystals were mounted in cryoloops (Hampton Research) and flash-cooled to 100 K in a stream of gaseous nitrogen produced by an X-Stream cryocooler (Rigaku-MSC). X-ray data were subsequently collected using a Mar345image plate detector (X-ray Research) mounted on a Rigaku RU-H3RHB rotating anode X-ray generator (operated at 50 kV and 100 mA) fitted with osmic confo∞ cal optics and a copper target (Cu Ka º 1.542 A). For the native dataset, a crystal was cryoprotected as described above, and 157 3 18 images were recorded to ∞ a resolution of 1.9 A, being a slight improvement on the ∞ resolution dataset.18 For the derivative, a original 2.0 A crystal was given a short ($10 s) soak in a modified cryoprotectant consisting of 0.52M ammonium sulphate, 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol in 100 mM CHES pH 9.5 and 1M potassium iodide, before flash cooling to 100 K. A dataset comprising 360 3 18 images was then recorded ∞ to 2.0 A resolution. X-ray data were initially processed in space group P422 and merged using the HKL software package (version 1.97).22 The data collection statistics are summarized in Table I. The structure was solved using both the native and derivative data by the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) approach. Programs

Substructure solution with SHELXD23 was performed for each of the two possible space groups (P41212 and P43212), which found 11 and 10 iodide sites, respectively (with occupancies greater than 0.35). These solutions gave figures-of-merit of 0.578 and 0.533, respectively, after phasing with SHELXE24 that increased to 0.722 and 0.603, respectively, after density modification with the program DM.25 At this point, it was clear that P41212, was the correct choice of space group, and this was confirmed after ARP/wARP26 automatically built 60 of the expected 69 residues for this solution, whereas it failed to build anything for the P43212 solution. Manual building was performed with the program O27 starting from the coordinates generated by ARP/wARP. This was alternated with restrained refinement with REFMAC5.28 A summary of the contents and geometrical parameters of the final structure is given in Table II. The coordinates and structure factor data for this structure have been deposited in the PDB with accession code 2CJJ. Results and Discussion. The structure of the RAD pro∞ tein, determined at 1.9 A, has a single copy of the 8 kDa RAD fragment in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1). Residues 8≠70 of the full-length protein (93 amino acids) could be resolved in the structure, and this covers the entire predicted MYB domain (8≠57) as defined by the PFAM database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/).32 MYB domains are typically around 50 amino acids (51≠52) in length and characterized by three Trp residues separated by 18 or 19 residues33; they belong to the ``all alpha'' class of proteins being comprised of three a-helices forming a compact bundle. The Trp residues contribute to the hydrophobic core of the domain,34 and together with flanking basic and polar residues, often directly participate in DNA binding, especially in helices two and three.

The positions of a-helices are indicated by red shading and the locations of the W,W,W motifs are boxed. EH has a Phe in the third position according to the structural alignment, although the adjacent residue is a Trp (also boxed). Residues showing large chemical shifts in ARR10-B upon binding DNA are indicated with blue bars. Residues that contact DNA in the crystal structure of EH are also shown as bars: blue bars representing interactions with the phosphate backbone and green bars indicating interactions with the DNA bases.

expected, RAD also forms a three-helix bundle, but instead of having three Trp residues, the third amino acid is substituted by a Tyr, and in addition, these residues are separated by gaps of 22 and 18 residues, respectively. Moreover, the C-terminal helix of RAD is significantly longer than the majority of MYB proteins, and at least four residues longer than its closest homologues (Table III and below). As a consequence, the C-terminal end of the RAD MYB domain should be redefined to at least Gly 66, the last residue of helix 3, to give a larger domain size of 59 residues. An analysis of crystal contacts did not reveal any biologically meaningful interactions, the largest interface ∞ being <500 A2, as calculated by the protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies (PISA) server (http://www.ebi.ac. uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html), and this corresponds to the interface between monomers related by a crystallographic 41 screw axis. Thus we conclude that at least the 8 kDa RAD fragment is likely to be monomeric, but cannot exclude the possibility of multimeric states of the fulllength protein. This could have implications for activity,

where, for example, a RAD dimer could mimic the two MYB domains of DIV. Structural homologues of RAD in the PDB were identified using the DALI server.38 The top five hits are summarized in Table III with Z-scores ranging from 8.3 down to 5.8. The first four are all single-repeat MYB proteins, whilst the fifth is repeat 1 of a 3-repeat protein. Hits 1 and 3 are unpublished NMR structures of MYB DNAbinding domains in human cDNA, namely a DnaJ homologue and the KIAA1903 protein, both of unknown function. Hit 2, another NMR structure, is a fragment of the Arabidopsis type-B response regulator, ARR10-B,35 whilst ∞ hit 4 is a 1.9 A resolution X-ray structure of the Drosophila engrailed homeodomain protein (EH) complexed to DNA.36 The fifth hit is the NMR structure of repeat 1 of mouse c-MYB, and is perhaps most representative of the classical MYB domain, being the only one displaying the three Trp motif.37 The poor conservation of this motif in RAD and the first four DALI hits, suggests that it is not strictly required for either maintaining the structural fold or for function in these proteins.

Versus RAD. Tyr (Y) and Phe (F) are considered as substitutes for Trp (W). EH has a Phe in the third position according to the structural alignment, although the adjacent residue is a Trp. See Figure 2.

On the structure-based sequence alignment shown in Figure 2, residues showing large chemical shifts in ARR10-B upon binding DNA35 are indicated, and residues that contact DNA in the crystal structure of EH are also shown.36 It is notable that in the latter, all the contacts with DNA bases involve residues in helix 3, consistent with this helix being entirely responsible for the sequence specific DNA recognition. In common with other 3-repeat MYBs, the interaction of repeat 1 of cMYB with DNA is relatively weak, and thus NMR analysis of this complex formation displays only minor chemical shifts for this domain (Fig. 2).37 A superposition of the RAD structure on the EH-DNA complex36 enables a crude model of a putative RAD-DNA complex to be produced, with the long third helix lying in the major groove of the DNA (Fig. 1), although RAD's ability to bind DNA has yet to be proven. Unfortunately, there is virtually no sequence conservation between this ``recognition'' helix and those of other MYB domains with a known cognate DNA sequence, making it impossible to predict potential target DNA sequences for RAD; at best we could tentatively suggest possible DNA binding residues in helix 3, based on whether they are buried in the core of the RAD domain, or solvent exposed. As mentioned previously, DIV has two MYB domains and these share respectively 48% and 31% sequence identity with the MYB domain of RAD (data not shown). However, sequence comparisons of the individual helices show that conservation in the third helix is significantly lower than these overall values, at 30 and 15% identity respectively for the two domains, perhaps indicating that there is in fact little or no competition between these two proteins for the same DNA binding sites, assuming they both have DNA binding roles. The full-length RAD sequence of 93 amino acids has a high theoretical pI value of 9.74 and an overall net positive charge of 6, consistent with its assumed function as a DNA-binding protein. However, the crystal structure itself, which represents two thirds of the protein, is actually electroneutral; most of the charge imbalance is provided by the missing 23 residues at the C-terminus, having a net positive charge of 5. This may be indicative of a role for this region in stabilizing complexes with DNA through DNA sequence-independent interactions with phosphate groups in the minor groove. Rather than being completely unstructured, secondary structure prediction with PSIPRED39 suggests that the C-terminal

tail ends in a 7-residue a-helix that is connected to helix 3 by a 14-residue loop. In conclusion, we have determined the crystal structure of a fragment of the RAD protein from Antirrhinum majus that is implicated in the developmental control of floral asymmetry. As predicted from weak sequence homology, it folds into the compact three-helix bundle typical of a MYB DNA binding domain, although the third helix is notably lengthened. This is the first crystal structure of a plant single-repeat MYB protein and it represents an initial step towards elucidating the function of RAD at the molecular level; experiments to determine protein≠protein interaction partners of RAD, and whether it binds to DNA, is in hand.
