ABSTRACT HIV-1 develops resistance to protease inhibitors predominantly by selecting mutations in the protease gene. Studies of resistant mutants of HIV-1 protease with single amino acid substitutions have shown a range of independent effects on specificity, inhibition, and stability. Four double mutants, K45I/L90M, K45I/V82S, D30N/V82S, and N88D/L90M were selected for analysis on the basis of observations of increased or decreased stability or enzymatic activity for the respective single mutants. The double mutants were assayed for catalysis, inhibition, and stability. Crystal structures were analyzed for the double mutants at resolutions of 2.2≠1.2 ≈ to determine the associated molecular changes. Sequence-dependent changes in proteaseinhibitor interactions were observed in the crystal structures. Mutations D30N, K45I, and V82S showed altered interactions with inhibitor residues at P2/P2 , P3/P3 /P4/P4 , and P1/P1 , respectively. One of the conformations of Met90 in K45I/L90M has an unfavorably close contact with the carbonyl oxygen of Asp25, as observed previously in the L90M single mutant. The observed catalytic efficiency and inhibition for the double mutants depended on the specific substrate or inhibitor. In particular, large variation in cleavage of p6pol-PR substrate was observed, which is likely to result in defects in the maturation of the protease from the Gag-Pol precursor and hence viral replication. Three of the double mutants showed values for stability that were intermediate between the values observed for the respective single mutants. D30N/V82S mutant showed lower stability than either of the two individual mutations, which is possibly due to concerted changes in the central P2-P2 and S2-S2 sites. The complex effects of combining mutations are discussed. Proteins 2002;48:107≠116.

therapeutic efficacy is limited because of the growing number of drug resistant mutants of the HIV-1 protease. Multidrug resistant HIV-1 arises in patients with AIDS receiving combination therapy.1,2 Analysis of clinical isolates has revealed extensive protease mutations that confer cross-resistance to protease inhibitors.3 Resistant mutations of at least 26 of the 99 protease residues have been reported in the clinic primarily from the B subtype of HIV-1.4 Multiple mutations accumulate in the protease gene on continued exposure to the drugs.5 In addition, mutations of protease cleavage sites can contribute to cross-resistance, especially Gag sites p2-NC, NC-p1, and NC-p6pol, NC-p6gag.6 Even in the absence of antiretroviral drugs, HIV-1 shows genetic diversity, especially in the protease gene.7 Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular basis for the altered activity of the resistant mutants with different combinations of substitutions in the protease gene to develop new antiviral therapies. Drug-resistant mutants of HIV-1 protease are expected to show reduced sensitivity to specific inhibitors, while maintaining sufficient enzymatic activity and specificity for viral maturation and infectivity. However, several of these resistant mutants produce defects in polyprotein processing and reduced viral infectivity.8 Single protease mutations and specific combinations can have lower viral infectivity than wild-type HIV-1. Studies have shown that a combination of several mutations was required to provide better viral replication than wild-type HIV-1 in the presence of clinical inhibitors.9 This replicative fitness agreed with the order of accumulation of mutations in patients under treatment with protease inhibitors. Previously, we characterized the effects of single substitutions

on catalytic activity, specificity, inhibition, and stability of HIV-1 protease.10,11 Mutants with either increased or decreased catalytic activity or stability relative to the wild-type enzyme were observed. There have been other studies showing that the substrate specificity, stability, and catalytic rate of resistant protease mutants can differ from the wild type.12,13 These studies suggested that the accumulation of multiple mutations can increase the viral viability by combining a mutant with lower activity or stability with a mutant of higher activity or stability. Therefore, a set of double-substitution protease mutants has been characterized and compared with the previously studied single-substitution mutants. MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction and Purification of HIV-1 Protease Mutants An HIV-1 protease (Genbank HIVHXB2CG) clone was constructed with substitutions at Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A for expression in E. coli. The proteolytic activity of this enzyme, the designed wild type, was indistinguishable from that of the native protease.10 DNA derived from this clone was used as a template for generating the mutants K45I/L90M, K45I/V82S, D30N/V82S, and N88D/ L90M, and the protease mutants were expressed and purified from inclusion bodies as described previously.11 Mutations were confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing and protein mass spectrometry. The efficiency of refolding was determined by active site titration against an nM inhibitor, as described.14 Enzyme Assays The kinetic parameters for protease cleavage of the CA-p2 (Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Leu/Ala-Glu-Ala-Met-Ser) and p6pol-PR (Val-Ser-Phe-Asn-Phe/Pro-Gln-Ile-Thr-Lys-Lys) peptides were determined by using an HPLC assay, as described previously.15 Peptides were synthesized and purified by reverse phase chromatography as described.10 Protease assays were performed by using 10 ≠2500 M peptide and 145≠1746 nM protease in 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 5.9, 1 M NaCl at 37∞C.15 In the N88D/L90M mutant, the kcat/Km value for hydrolysis of the CA-p2 peptide was determined by a competition assay16 using the p6pol-PR peptide as substrate. Standard errors calculated for the kcat/Km from the individual parameters17 were 25%. The spectroscopic assay with the chromogenic substrate Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-p-nitroPhe-Glu-Ala-Nle-amide was used to determine the Ki values and the protease activity in the presence of 0 ≠ 4.0 M urea as described previously.10 The assay conditions were 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol. Inhibition constants for CA-p2 analog inhibitor, Arg-ValLeu-r-Phe-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH2, where r indicates the reduced peptide and Nle is norleucine, and p2-NC analog inhibitor, Ac-Thr-Ile-Nle-r-Nle-Gln-Arg-NH2, were obtained from the IC50 values estimated from a doseresponse curve with the spectroscopic assay using the equation Ki (IC50 0.5[E])/(1 [S]/Km), where [E] and

[S] are the protease and substrate concentrations, respectively.18 The data were fit by using Grafit software (Erithacus). Crystallographic Analysis The double mutants K45I/L90M, K45I/V82S, D30N/ V82S, and N88D/L90M were crystallized with the CA-p2 analog inhibitor. Crystals were grown at room temperature by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method. The reservoir contained 0.25 citrate/0.5 M phosphate buffer, pH 5≠ 6.5, 10% DMSO, 10 mM DTT, and 20 ≠50% saturated ammonium sulfate as precipitant. The protein (2≠10 mg/mL) was preincubated with 5- or 10-fold molar excess of inhibitor. The crystallization drops had a 1:1 ratio by volume of reservoir solution and protein. The final drop was typically 2 L and crystals grew in 2≠7 days. X-ray diffraction data for the K45I/V82S, K45I/L90M, and N88D/L90M mutant crystals were collected on beamline X12-B at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven. Data for D30N/V82S were collected on a rotating anode source with an RAXIS-II detector. Data were processed by using the HKL suite.19 K45I (1daz) protease coordinates were used as the starting model for molecular replacement using AmoRe.20 Mutants K45I/ V82S and K45I/L90M were refined by using SHELX21 and refitted by using O.22 Alternate conformations for residues were modeled where appropriate. Mutants D30N/V82S and N88D/L90M were refined by using XPLOR23 and refitted by using CHAIN.24 The coordinates for the structures have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with codes 1K1U, 1K1T, 1K2B, and 1K2C. RESULTS Rational for Selection of Mutations Studies on resistant enzymes with single mutations have shown that they had altered inhibitor affinity, enzyme specificity, and/or stability.10,12,13 Our previous re-

sults also showed that there was no direct correlation between specificity, stability, and inhibition of the enzyme.10 Crystallographic analysis of D30N, K45I, N88D, and L90M mutants in complex with two peptide analogs was used to provide a structural basis for understanding the observed effects.11 On the basis of these studies, four double mutants, D30N/V82S, K45I/L90M, K45I/V82S, and N88D/L90M, were selected for analysis. The location of the selected mutations in the protease dimer is shown in Figure 1. The double mutations were chosen to combine single substitutions with well-defined effects on protease stability or activity. Mutation K45I, arising from exposure to XM323,25 has been shown to stabilize the flaps, resulting in increased stability and enzyme activity. L90M, which is commonly found on exposure to Saquinavir,26 was shown to introduce unfavorably close contacts with the main-chain of the catalytic aspartate residues resulting in lowered stability and activity. D30N, which is frequently seen in Nelfinavir treatment,27,28 showed altered specificity due to changes in the interaction with P2/P2 . N88D, which accompanies D30N in Nelfinavir treatment,28 lacked water molecules that linked Asn88 to Thr74/Thr31/Asp30. V82S, a mutation seen in Indinavir and Ritonavir therapy,29 showed greatly reduced catalytic activity. Therefore, K45I, a relatively stable and efficient enzyme was combined with L90M, which has low stability, and V82S with low activity. N88D/L90M combines two nonactive site mutants; N88D, which has high stability with L90M, which shows poor stability. Finally, double-mutant D30N/ V82S combines two active-site mutations with different relative activities but stabilities similar to wild-type protease. Enzyme Activity and Stability of Mutant Proteases Assays were performed to measure catalytic activity, inhibition, and stability relative to the wild-type enzyme, as described previously.10 Kinetic parameters for wildtype and mutant protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of twopeptide substrates representing the HIV-1 CA-p2 and p6pol-PR cleavage sites are shown in Table I. Protease cleavage of these sites is potentially regulated or rate

limiting for viral maturation. Hydrolysis of the CA-p2 cleavage site was suggested to be a regulatory step in maturation of the virus particle,30 whereas cleavage of the p6pol-PR site to release the free N-terminus of the protease is critical for stable tertiary structure and catalytic activity.31 Inhibition of the hydrolysis reaction was measured by using two-peptide analog inhibitors representing the CA-p2 and p2-NC sites. The p2-NC site is reported to be cleaved 400-fold faster than the CA-p2 site.30 Finally, the protease activity was assayed with increasing concentrations of urea as a measure of its stability. Studies have shown protease activity in a denaturing solvent to correlate with transition curves from fluorescence and circular dichroism, indicative of protein unfolding.14 The results are summarized relative to the values for wild-type protease in Figure 2. Kinetic Parameters for Cleavage of Peptide Substrates The two substrates did not show the same pattern of relative catalytic efficiency of cleavage especially in the double mutants [Fig. 2(A)]. Only D30N/V82S mutant had lower than wild-type activity on both substrates. All double mutants except N88D/L90M showed lower catalytic efficiency for the CA-p2 peptide compared with the wild-type protease, largely because of higher Km values. In the N88D/L90M mutant, increasing the substrate concentration above the apparent Km value resulted in a decrease in the cleavage rate, likely because of substrate inhibition. Therefore, a competition assay was performed to obtain the kcat/Km. In the p6pol-PR peptide, all double mutants except D30N/V82S showed 3- to 30-fold increased catalytic efficiency relative to wild type. K45I/L90M showed the best values with the lowest Km and highest kcat of the tested mutants. Effects of Peptide Analog Inhibitors As in single mutants, the CA-p2 analog (27≠146 nM Ki range) is a better inhibitor for the double mutants than p2-NC (1.9 ≠5.2 M Ki range) [Fig. 2(B)]. The Ki for inhibition of wild-type by CA-p2 analog is 75 nM and

Protease Stability The wild-type enzyme had a half-maximal activity at 1.9 ≠2.0 M urea, whereas the complete set of mutants showed values that varied from 0.8 to 3.3 M urea [Fig. 2(C)]. Mutant D30N/V82S was more sensitive to urea than wild type, mutants K45I/V82S and N88D/L90M were similar to wild type, and K45I/L90M mutant was more stable than wild-type enzyme. The effect of combining two mutations is shown by comparison of the values for the pairs of single substitution along with the double mutants. N88D/L90M mutant, in which the two mutations do not directly contact substrate, showed stability intermediate between the values for the individual N88D and L90M mutations. Mutants K45I/V82S and K45I/L90M also showed protease stability to urea that was between the values of the individual K45I and V82S or L90M mutations. Therefore, for three of four double mutants, the effect on protease stability was approximately additive. Only in D30N/V82S mutant, which combined mutations of two residues in the substrate binding site, was the stability lower than that observed for the individual single mutants. Crystallographic Analysis of HIV-1 Protease Double Mutants Crystal structures of the four double mutants, D30N/ V82S, K45I/V82S, K45I/L90M, and N88D/L90M complexed with CA-p2 inhibitor were determined to provide a structural basis for the observed changes in protease activity. The X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Tables II and III. The K45I/V82S mutant data extended to 1.2 ≈, the highest resolution reported to date for HIV-1 protease complexes. These high-resolution structures permit identification of relatively subtle changes in interactions of protease with inhibitor and solvent structure. The electron density for the catalytic aspartates in this structure is depicted in Figure 3. The crystals are in space group P212121 with one dimer in the asymmetric unit. The active site contains two inhibitor molecules with 50% occupancy in all structures except D30N/V82S, in which only one inhibitor is found. Incidentally, D30N/V82S structure has the lowest resolution of 2.2 ≈. The inhibitor orientation is similar in all the structures except K45I/L90M. The structures were compared with the previously described crystal structures of wild-type protease and the mutants with the single substitutions of D30N, K45I, N88D, and L90M.11 Overall, the crystal structures of the mutants were very similar to the wild-type protease with root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 0.1≠ 0.5 ≈ on main-chain atoms.32 This value is within the range observed for identical proteins.33 Comparative analysis of the various mutants using Difference Distance Matrices34 did not reveal any significant structural changes. Structural Changes Due to Presence of Mutations In mutants K45I/L90M and N88D/L90M, the Met90 side-chain was observed to have two conformations as reported previously in the structure of the single mutant

p2-NC analog is 2.2 M. Both inhibitors were less effective on mutant D30N/V82S than wild type, although more effective than on the component single mutants. K45I/ V82S is similar to wild type and inhibited more effectively than the component mutants. Mutants K45I/L90M and N88D/L90M were more sensitive than wild-type enzyme to inhibition by the CA-p2 analog. However, N88D/L90M mutant is affected less by the p2-NC inhibitor than wild type.

L90M.11 In both subunits of the K45I/L90M dimer, the two alternate conformations of Met90 are equally populated with a relative occupancy of about 50%. Figure 4 depicts the electron density for the two alternate conformations in one subunit. In the N88D/L90M structure too, presence of two conformations is confirmed in the difference density map. In one of these conformations, the Met90 side-chain has unfavorably close van der Waals contacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Asp25 (3.3 ≈), as previously observed in the L90M mutant.11 This is expected to destabilize the catalytic loop at the dimer interface and alter protease stability and, consequently, enzymatic activity. Similar close contacts have been reported for the complex of the G48V/L90M mutant with the clinical drug Saquinavir.35 Mutants K45I/V82S and D30N/V82S both include the V82S substitution. Residue 82 has a major contribution to the binding pocket for the substrate or inhibitor group at P1 and P1 , which are generally hydrophobic. In the protease, Val82 is part of the hydrophobic S1/S1 pocket, which also contains residues Leu23, Gly27, Ile50, Pro81, and Ile84. Thus, Val82/82 stabilizes the binding of hydrophobic residues at P1/P1 through favorable interactions. V82S mutant substitutes the hydrophobic Val side-chain with the smaller more polar Ser. In mutants K45I/V82S and D30N/V82S, the Ser hydroxyl group is pointed away from the P1/P1 residue of the inhibitor toward the solvent (Fig. 5). Hence, favorable hydrophobic interactions with substrate or inhibitor are lost in the mutants, leading to poor binding and/or catalysis. In the K45I/V82S structure, the side-chains and carbonyl oxygens of Ile50/50 show disorder. There are equal populations of the normal and flipped peptide (carbonyl oxygens at 0∞ and 180∞, respectively). It is not clear whether the disorder is related to the two orientations of the inhibitor. The loss of inhibitor interactions with residue 82 could also lead to the (79 ≠ 82) loop being more flexible. This could in turn affect binding of flap residues, especially Ile50, which contributes significantly to hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface and lead to poor catalysis and/or poor stability or both.

In the D30N/V82S mutant, the structural changes seen at 30/30 due to the D30N mutation are similar to those previously observed in D30N.11 The side-chain of Asn30 shows relatively small changes compared with the wildtype when it interacts with a polar residue such as P2 Glu. On the other hand, when Asn30 interacts with a hydrophobic residue such as P2Val, there is a movement of the Asn30 side-chain toward the inhibitor. The hydrogen bond between O 1 of Asn30, and main-chain amide N of P3Arg is shorter (2.9 ≈) in D30N/V82S than that seen in the wild type and other structures ( 3.4 ≈). However, it is not clear how this change alters the catalytic process. It is of interest that most of the cleavage sites in the Gag-Pol precursor have a polar group either at P2 or P2 . The only exceptions are RT/IN and NC/p1, which have hydrophobic groups both at P2 and P2 . A proton-mediated interaction between Asp30 and P2 Glu has been observed in several retroviral protease complexes.11,36 ≠38 This interaction could be important in regulating polyprotein processing, especially in a varying pH environment. Alteration of this interaction could affect the local electrostatics for inhibitor binding and substrate catalysis. The K45I mutation reduces the mobility of the flap (residues 42≠52) due to substitution of the flexible Lys side-chain with hydrophobic Ile. Unlike Lys45, which usually tends to be disordered, Ile45 is ordered.11 Ile45 stabilizes the hydrophobic S4/S4 pocket (Ile47, Val56, Leu76). Because the flap also contributes significantly to the dimer interface, protease stability is also improved. Consistent with greater dimer stability, enzymes with K45I mutation show increased stability to urea denaturation compared with wild type. In the crystal lattice, the flap is also involved in contacts with the neighboring molecules. Therefore, the reduced mobility of the flap may partly contribute to the better diffraction seen in crystal structures with K45I mutation ( 1.55 ≈). Previously, two water molecules were found to link the side-chain of Asn88 with the main-chain/side-chain of Thr31 and Thr74. In some structures, one of these waters

also links the side-chains of Asn88 and Asp30. Both these waters were found missing in both subunits of the N88D single mutant.11 In the N88D/L90M double mutant, however, these two waters are present in both the subunits of the enzyme. These waters contribute to the stability of the local secondary structure; however, their exact role in binding/catalysis is not clear. DISCUSSION The tested mutants showed a large variation in their catalytic efficiency, especially for cleavage of the p6pol-PR substrate [Fig. 2(A)]. The CA-p2 substrate was cleaved with catalytic efficiencies ranging from 0.2- to 10-fold of the wild type, whereas the p6pol-PR showed the larger range of 0.02- to 30-fold. The double mutants were more sensitive to inhibitors than the single mutants. Sensitivity to urea denaturation showed anticipated results for the double mutants except in D30N/V82S. Mutant K45I/V82S combines a catalytically efficient and relatively stable enzyme, K45I, with V82S, which shows poor catalysis but is similar to wild type in stability. In the double mutant, stability is intermediate between

the two single mutants. In catalysis, however, the effect of the V82S substitution is predominant in the CA-p2 peptide. This is due to P1/P1 (Leu/Ala) of the substrate, more particularly, small P1 Ala having fewer interactions with Ser82 than Val82, thus resulting in poor binding/catalysis as discussed above. With p6pol-PR, however, the catalytic efficiency of K45I/V82S is much higher than the wild-type enzyme. The larger P1/P1 (Phe/Pro) in p6pol-PR can fit the S1/S1 pocket better. The K45I mutation is particularly favorable for hydrolysis of p6pol-PR peptide where hydrophobic residues at P3/P3 (Phe/Ile) could interact favorably with Ile45, and P3 Phe may further stabilize the flap by interacting with Phe53. Ser/Thr at P4/P4 could possibly interact with Asp29/Asp30 and also contribute hydrophobic atoms to the S4/S4 pocket (Ile45, Ile47, Val56, and Leu76). These factors could contribute to the efficiency of catalysis/binding of p6pol-PR. Hence, certain mutations may be advantageous to particular cleavage sites in the polyprotein and may be favored in the presence of other mutations. On the other hand, extremely efficient catalysis of p6pol-PR peptide could interfere with the correct

ordered processing of the Gag-Pol and hence viral replication. Mutant K45I/L90M combines the low-stability catalytically poor mutant L90M with K45I. In the double mutant, the low stability of L90M is compensated by K45I. Although the catalytic efficiency of the double mutant is marginally better than L90M, the enzyme still shows relatively poor catalysis for the CA-p2 peptide. Thus, the conformation and orientation of the catalytic loop that is perturbed by the L90M mutation seems to be critical for efficient processing of this peptide. In contrast, p6pol-PR is cleaved extremely efficiently by the enzyme relative to the wild type. This probably results partly from the stabilizing effects of the K45I mutation for this peptide. Thus, catalysis is affected not only by sequence specific and conformational effects around the active site but also is closely linked to the stability of the protease. The single mutants N88D and L90M are relatively inefficient in catalyzing both substrates but differ in their stability toward urea denaturation; L90M has low stability, whereas N88D has higher stability than wild type. The double-mutant N88D/L90M, with intermediate urea stability relative to the single mutants, is inhibited by high

concentrations of CA-p2 peptide. This could be due to an alternate nonproductive binding mode of the peptide leading to inhibition of catalysis. However, the N88D/L90M mutant catalyzes the hydrolysis of p6pol-PR better than does the wild-type enzyme. Both N88D and L90M are not part of the substrate-binding site, but they can influence the catalytic process through indirect interactions. It is probable that substrate residues beyond P3/P3 interact favorably with the side-chain of Asp88. However, in the absence of a crystal structure with p6pol-PR it is not clear why p6pol-PR is efficiently cleaved by N88D/L90M. Residues D30N and V82S are both located in the active site. In terms of urea denaturation, individually, D30N and V82S are comparable to the wild type. However, the combination results in an enzyme with lower stability. The P2-P2 inhibitor residues contribute to most of the protease/ inhibitor interactions that stabilize the complex. Inhibitor residues beyond P2/P2 tend to show disorder and contribute relatively few interactions in the complex. V82S alters the hydrophobic interactions with P1/P1 , and D30N alters interactions with P2/P2 . Therefore, the combination of D30N and V82S alters the binding of the whole central region of the substrate P2-P2 residues, which is deleteri-

ous for productive binding and hydrolysis of substrates. Both substrates are cleaved poorly by this mutant, and the inhibitors are also not effective against this mutant. Poorer binding of the ligand to D30N/V82S mutant may be reflected by the observed lower stability than the wild-type enzyme. This study on combining two mutations with known effects on protease activity and stability showed some predictable results and some unexpected outcomes. Mutants like D30N/V82S, L90M, and V82S are expected to slow down viral replication due to inefficient processing, whereas K45I, K45I/L90M, and N88D/L90M are expected to interfere with ordered polyprotein processing because of extremely rapid hydrolysis of certain cleavage sites. D30N and L90M have been reported to have impaired fitness.39 Defects in Gag and Gag-pol processing have been observed for L90M and V82A/S.8,9 The sequence and context of the substrate/inhibitor residues also seem to be critical in the overall performance of the enzyme.40,41 A series of substrates and inhibitors need to be examined to fully under-

stand sequence-specific effects. For the tested mutants, the range of cleavage efficiencies of p6pol-PR substrate was an order of magnitude greater than that for the CA-p2 peptide. The larger hydrophobic P1 Phe and P1 Pro side-chains in p6pol-PR are expected to fit better into the S1 and S1 -binding pockets making p6pol-PR peptide more sensitive to local structural changes in the enzyme than the CA-p2 peptide with P1 Leu and P1 Ala. Ordered and timely cleavage of p6pol-PR is critical for the release of fully active protease. It has been shown that optimal cleavage of p6pol-PR is essential for Gag processing and viral infectivity.42 The overall stability of the protease is also important, because its folding and autocatalytic release from the polyprotein are closely linked steps in polyprotein processing. This study shows the importance of analyzing the structure and activity of specific mutations to understand the effects leading to resistance to a particular drug. It is important to analyze the single mutations as well as specific combinations to understand why certain mutations arise in response to a specific inhibitor.
