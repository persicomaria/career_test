The Antigenic Identity of Peptide-MHC Complexes: A Comparison of the Conformations of Five Viral Peptides Presented by HLA-A2
Dean R. Madden,` David N. Garboczi,' t and Don C. Wiley' * *Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology *Howard Hughes Medical Institute Harvard University Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 1992; Guo et al., 1992; Silver et al., 1992). Interactions between conserved MHC side chains and polar main chain atoms of the peptide termini provide a universal peptide binding capability. Additional binding energy and limited peptide sequence selectivity are introduced by the binding of a few peptide "anchor" side chains in pockets formed by MHC side chains that are polymorphic (Garrett et al., 1989; Saper et al., 1991; Falk et al., 1991; Guo et al., 1993). Structures of class I MHC complexes with single viral peptides (Fremont et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992; Silver et al., 1992) and with a mixture of endogenous peptides (Madden et al., 1992; Guo et al., 1992) reveal that bound peptides are most exposed in the center of the cleft, where the peptides arch away from the floor of the peptidebinding site. It is presumably this region of the peptide that, because of its accessibility, encodes the primary antigenic character of the peptide-MHC complex. So far, the comparison of different antigenic peptides presented by a given class I MHC molecule has been limited to one pair of viral peptides, a vesicular stomatitis virus octamer and a Sendai virus nonamer bound to H-2Kb (Fremont et al., 1992; Matsumura et al., 1992). To understand the structural and antigenic differences caused by changes in the sequence, but not length, of class l-bound peptides, we have cocrystallized human leukocyte antigen HLA-A2 (HLA-A*0201) with four nonameric viral peptides: influenza A virus matrix Ml residues 58-66 (Bednarek et al., 1991); human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-l) reverse transcriptase (RTase) residues 309-317 (Tsomides et al., 1991); HIV-1 gp120 residues 197-205 (Garboczi et al., 1992); human T lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax residues 11-l 9 (Utz et al., 1992) (see Figure 1 for sequences). In addition, to study the accommodation of peptides longer than 9 amino acids, we have analyzed a cocrystal of HLA-A2 with a decamer peptide, hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid residues 18-27 (Bertoletti et al., 1993). The influenza A, hepatitis B, and HTLV-1 peptides appear to represent immunodominant disease-response targets in HLA-A2+ individuals (McMichael et al., 1988; Nayersina et al., 1993; Koenig et al., 1993). Comparison of the structures of the five peptide-HLAA2 complexes shows that the peptide backbone dramatically adjusts its conformation in the center of the binding cleft in response to the sequence of the peptide. Because of the conformational differences among bound peptides, side chains at a given position in the center of the peptide (e.g., P5, P6, or P7) can point up, down, or sideways in the binding site, depending on the complete peptide sequence. The MHC molecule shows much more limited conformational variation at a few side chain positions, in response to presence of different bound peptides. It is therefore the peptide itself that dominates the antigenic identity of a peptide-MHC complex through its unique sequence-dependent conformation.

Summary Complexes of five peptides (from HIV-l, influenza A virus, HTLV-1, and hepatitis B virus proteins) bound to the human class I MHC molecule HLA-A2 have been studied by X-ray crystallography. While the peptide termini and their second and C-terminal anchor side chains are bound similarly in all five cases, the main chain and side chain conformations of each peptide are strikingly different in the center of the binding site, and these differences are accessible to direct TCR recognition. Each of the central peptide residues is seen to point up for some bound peptides, but down or sideways for others. Thus, although fixed at its ends, the structure of an MHC-bound peptide appears to be a highly complex function of its entire sequence, potentially sensitive to even small sequence differences. In contrast, MHC structural variation is relatively limited. These results offer a structural framework for understanding the role of nonanchor peptide side chains in both peptide-MHC binding affinity and TCR recognition. Introduction The cytolytic immune response is governed by a trimolecular interaction: antigenic peptides bind to class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, forming a complex that is recognized byT cell receptors(TCRs). The antigenic peptides are derived from intracellular proteins, including (in the case of a viral infection of the cell) viral proteins (Townsend and Bodmer, 1989) while the class I MHC molecules are expressed at three loci in the human genome and comprise a large number of different molecules, with characteristic patterns of sequence conservation and polymorphism (Parham et al., 1988). Each of the class I MHC proteins is capable of binding a set of peptides of diverse sequences, but sharing a sequence motif (Falk et al., 1991). Recent studies have elucidated the mechanism by which this sequence-degenerate binding occurs (Madden et al., 1991,1992; Madden and Wiley, 1992; Fremont et al., 1992; Matsumura et al., 1992; Zhang et al.,

Structures of Viral Peptides Bound to HLA-A2 695

Results We have determined the structures of four nonameric viral peptides (Figures l A-l D) and one decameric viral peptide (Figure 1 E) in complex with HLA-A2. In Figure 1, the peptides are viewed from the side of the binding cleft, with their main chains deep in the cleft near the N-termini, rising up toward the surface of the complex as a result of a kink at residues P3 and P4 and then gradually returning toward the floor of the cleft at the C-termini. Overall, the conformations of these viral peptides bound to HLA-A2 are therefore similar to those first observed for a collection of endogenous peptides complexed with HLA-627 (HLA-B*2705) (Madden et al., 1991, 1992) and also for individual viral peptides complexed with H-2Kb (Fremont et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992) and HLA-A68 (HLA-A*6801) (Silver et al., 1992). When the orientations of individual peptide side chains in the center of the cleft are examined, however, striking differences are found for the various bound peptides (Figures 2 and 3). For example, of the four nonameric peptides, two have P5 pointing up (HTLV-1 Tax and HIV-1 RTase), one has P5 pointing sideways toward the a2 a helix (influenza A matrix), and one has P5 pointing down (HIV-1 gp120). Similar differences are found at P6 (Figures 2 and 38) and P7 (Figures 2 and 3C). For comparison, the constant orientation of the P2 anchor side chains of all five peptides is shown in Figure 3D. Also, examination of space-filling models of the five structures (Figure 4) shows that this region of large peptide structural differences is directly accessible to TCR recognition, even though most (73%-830/o) of the solvent-accessible surfaces of the peptides are buried upon binding to HLA-A2, as was observed for viral peptides bound to H-2Kb (Fremont et al., 1992). Different peptide side chain orientations do not depend only on the particular side chain present at that position, as shown by comparison of the HIV-l RTase and influenza A matrix peptides. Both of these peptides have a valine side chain at P6, yet for the influenza A matrix peptide, PG-Val points sideways toward the al a helix, while for the HIV-1 RTase peptide, PG-Val points more toward the floor of the cleft (see Figures 2 and 38). Steric interaction is possible between peptide side chains (e.g., P3 and P5) so that sequence changes at one peptide position could cause conformational changes at another. For example, changing P3 from leucine to phenylalanine in the influenza A matrix peptide could displace PS-Phe. Peptide length variation can also affect side chain orientation: the nonamer P5 and P6 side chains generally point toward the a2 and al a helices, respectively, but for the decamer they switch orientations so that P5 points toward the al
a helix and P6 toward the a2 a helix. Thus, the orientation

of an individual peptide side chain depends on the context of the peptide sequence in which it is located. To investigate the structural basis for the sequence dependence of MHC-bound peptide conformations, we have performed a detailed comparison of the peptide structures. Four Nonameric Peptides: Effect of Sequence Differences When this comparison is done for the four nonameric peptide structures (al a2 domains only), the main chain atoms of the first three and last two peptide amino acids are seen to be essentially superimposable (Figure 5A), held in place by binding interactions of the polar main chain atoms of the peptides as well as the anchor side chains of P2 and P9 (PQ where B represents the C-terminal peptide amino acid) (Figure 58). These binding interactions include those previously identified between the main chain of the peptide and MHC side chains conserved in most or all class I protein sequences (Madden et al., 1991, 1992; Madden and Wiley, 1992; Matsumura et al., 1992; Guo et al., 1992; Silver et al., 1992). In addition, there are several hydrogen bonds formed between the main chain atoms of all four peptides and polymorphic MHC side chains in the HLA-A2

cleft: Glu-63 hydrogen bonds to the P2 amide nitrogen, Lys-66 to the P2 carbonyl oxygen, Tyr-99 to the P3 amide nitrogen, and Asp-77 to the P9 amide nitrogen. The extensive N- and C-terminal binding interactions also hold the peptides rigidly at their ends. At all five peptide N-termini, the atomic temperature factors, which reflect structural mobility, are well below the average for MHC atoms, while at the C-termini they are approximately equal to the average. The fixation of the peptide termini, however, does not preclude substantial conformational differences in the

central portion of the peptide-binding cleft. These can be broken down into main chain (Figure 5C) and side chain (Figure 5D) components. The main chain structural variation is composed of both a side-to-side displacement of the peptide main chain arch between the al a helix and the a2 a helix and also of a twisting of the main chain along its length (Figure 5C). The combined effect of these motions is to alter both the position and orientation of the peptide main chain amide and carbonyl bonds. As found for a nonameric influenza A nucleoprotein peptide bound to HLA-A68 (Silver et al., 1992) the peptide main chain

contributes to the antigenic surface of the complex (see Figure 4) so that this variation is directly visible to the TCR. The twisting of the peptide main chain also alters the orientation of the Ca-CD bond (Figure 5C), which in turn affects both the position and orientation of the individual peptide side chains (see Figures 2 and 3). This means that even relatively short side chains, with little side chain conformational flexibility, can be displayed to the TCR in fundamentally different orientations, as already described

for the PG-Val of influenza A matrix and HIV-1 RTase peptides (see Figure 36). Further differences in the contribution of a peptide side chain to the antigenic surface of a peptide-MHC complex are caused by rotations of peptide side chains, as seen for the P5 side chain: the P5-Tyr of the HTLV-1 Tax peptide points up, while the P8Phe of the influenza A matrix peptide points toward the a2 a helix and downward to tuck under the MHC side chain of Gln-155 (see Fiaure 3A).

Cell 698

Similarly, while the P7 side chains are generally oriented toward the a2 a helix, the P7-Pheof the influenza A matrix peptide points downward, while the P7-His of the HIV-1 RTase peptide points up toward the TCR (see Figure 3C). Temperature factors for these central peptide residues are higher than at either terminus, but do not exceed 51 A2 for any peptide atom (and are generally in the range observed for MHC atoms), indicating that the different conformations of different peptides are somewhat more flexible than the tightly bound ends, but are nonetheless relatively stable. As a result of this sequence dependence of peptide conformation, the antigenic surface of a peptide-MHC complex is determined not only by the substitution of different peptide side chains into sockets along the main chain, but by the interaction of the peptide main chain and side chain conformations, which in turn depends on the side chains present at all positions in the peptide sequence.

Secondary Anchors In light of recent observations that nonanchor peptide side chains can have an important modulatory effect on HLAA2 binding (Parker et al., 1992; Ruppert et al., 1993), we have examined the contacts between nonanchor peptide side chains and the MHC-binding cleft. The N- and C-terminal peptide residues Pl -P3 and P(D-l)-PD share a common conformation in all five viral peptides so that the side chains at each position occupy a shared volume and contact a relatively common set of MHC residues (Figure 5A; Table l), even when their identity is variable, as is the case for Pl, P3, and P(sZ-1). The P3 side chain, in particular, binds in a clearly defined pocket (the D pocket [Saper et al., 1991]), nestled between the aromatic ringsof Tyr-99 and Tyr-159. For the central peptide side chains (i.e., P4P&%2)), however, sequence differences are coupled with conformational differences. As a result, the P7-Val side chain of the HTLV-1 Tax peptide points toward the floor of the cleft and contacts MHC residues 97, 116, and 147, while the P7-His side chain of the HIV-1 RTase peptide points toward the a2 a helix and contacts MHC residues 150, 152, and 155 (Table 1; see Figure 3C). In this sense, there is no single P7-binding pocket, but rather several subsets of MHC side chains that may or may not contact the P7 side chain, depending on its orientation in the particular peptide that is bound. Nevertheless, at least for nonameric peptides, it can be generalized that the P5 and P7 side chains are oriented toward the a2 a helix, while

For the matrix at each peptide position, the columns are labeled by the MHC amino acids (e.g., Y59, E63, etc.) that may contact a peptide side chain at that position. The four rows of each matrix correspond to the four amino acids designated in the column to the left of each matrix. A closed or open rectangle at the intersection of a peptide row and an MHC column indicates the presence or absence, respectively, of a contact (<4 A) between the peptide side chain and the MHC residue. A stippled rectangle indicates a glycine in the peptide.

the P4 and P6 side chains are oriented toward the al a helix (see Figures 2 and 3). All but one of the central peptide side chains make contacts with MHC residues (Table 1). The exception is the PS-Cys of the HIV-1 gp120 peptide. Electron density in the vicinity of this side chain suggests that it may have been oxidized during the course of reconstitution, crystallization, or both so that it may not be in a strictly native conformation in this structure. Several other features of the HIV-1 gp120 peptide are unique, including the presence of a glycosylation site at the PG-Asn residue, which points up toward the solvent. This suggests that the presence of carbohydrate would not necessarily prevent pep-

tide binding. Glycopeptides capable of binding to class II MHC molecules have been shown to elicit specific T cell responses in vivo (Ishioka et al., 1992). The PG-Asn is also involved in a 3.6 A crystal contact with a Glu-53 of a symmetry-related molecule, which may cause the structure to differ from its normal solution state. The only other crystal contact involving a peptide side chain is found between the PS-Asp of the hepatitis B nucleocapsid decamer and Lys-19 of &-microglobulin (2.6 A). Hepatitis B Nucleocapsid Decamer: Binding Longer Peptides Compared with the nonamer peptides, the additional residue of the hepatitis B nucleocapsid decamer is accommodated primarily in the center of the binding cleft (Figure 6). This is consistent with observations in H-2Kb and HLA-A66 that peptide length variability is accommodated by structural insertions or deletions (so-called bulges) in the center of the peptide (Fremont et al., 1992; Guo et al., 1992). In the binding of the hepatitis B nucleocapsid peptide to HLA-AP, the peptide backbone zigzags twice, first horizontally between residues P5 and P6 (Figure 6A) and then vertically between residues P6 and P6 (Figure 6B). As seen in a side view, the decamer peptide does not bulge "out" of the binding cleft (i.e., further away from the floor of the cleft), but rather adjusts within it, exploiting the width of the central part of the cleft (Figure 6B).

The buckling of the hepatitis B nucleocapsid decamer in the center of the binding site fails to accommodate fully the additional length of the peptide and causes its C-terminal carboxylate to extend 0.9-l .l A beyond those of the four nonamers (Figure 6B). This substantially lengthens a conserved hydrogen bond from the P(Q-1) carbonyl oxygen to conserved MHC side chain Trp-147 (distance for nonamers and decamer, 2.9-3.0 A and 3.4 A, respectively). The remaining peptide terminal interactions with conserved MHC side chains are preserved with reasonable geometry. A similar shift was observed in the comparison of an octamer and a nonamer bound to H-2Kb: the C-terminus of the shorter peptide is displaced slightly relative to that of the nonamer (0.57 A) and may require a compensating conformational shift of 0.61 A of residues 142-151 of the a2 a helix (Fremont et al., 1992) although the H-2Kb conformational shift may instead be the result of a crystal contact involving these residues. MHC Conformational Differences There are no concerted peptide-induced adjustments of the al a2 main chain conformation required for the binding of the nonameric and decameric peptides to HLA-A2 (Figure 7). A least-squares superposition of the main chain atoms found in 6 strands or a helices of the binding site yields a maximum root mean squared (RMS) difference between any two pairs of al a2 domains of 0.3-0.5 A, well

Structures 701

within the estimated coordinate error of -0.6 A (based on a free R factor [l&J) (Luzzati, 1952). (All-atom pairwise superpositions of the nonamer-bound MHC structures yield RMS differences of 0.8-l .O A, while superpositions of the decamer-bound MHC structure on nonamer-bound structures yield RMS differences of 1.1-l .2 A.) Virtually all main chain atoms of the binding sites can be superimposed with negligible differences. The largest main chain structural differences between the MHC-binding sites in complexes with the five different peptides are found between residues 144 and 151 of the a2 a helix, the same area for which a shift was observed in H-2Kb (Fremont et al., 1992). The HLA-A2 complexes can be divided into two groups, within which the main chain conformations of residues 144-151 are essentially identical. HLA-ABbinding sitescomplexed with the hepatitis B decamer, and HIV-1 RTase and influenza A nonamer peptides form one group. Following least-squares superposition of the binding sites (see Experimental Procedures), pait-wise comparisons of the a carbons of MHC residues 144-151 for these three peptide complexes reveal RMS differences between 0.28 A (hepatitis B versus HIV-1 RTase) and 0.45 A (hepatitis B versus influenza A). The second group includes the HTLV-1 and HIV-1 gp120 nonamer peptide complexes, whose Ca RMS difference (residues 144-151) is0.34A. Within both groups, the RMS variations are considerably smaller than the estimated coordinate error of the structures. Between the two groups, larger differences are found. For example, the Ca RMS difference (residues 144-151) between the HIV-1 RTase and HTLV-1 peptide complexes is 1 .O A, while for the hepatitis B and HTLV-1 complexes it is 0.9 A. These larger differences do not, however, correlate with obvious differences in the peptide structures at their C-termini, since the first group of identical complexes includes a nonamer with a PS-Val (HIV-1 RTase), a nonamer with a PS-Leu (influenza A matrix), and a decamer whose carboxylate is displaced relative toall four nonamers by - 1 .OA(hepatitis B nucleocapsid). All of the structures described here (as well as the two H-2Kb structures) have crystal contacts involving MHC residues between 144 and 151. Therefore, comparisons between structures in different space groups involve different crystal contacts, while comparisons between structures in the same space group may be influenced by unit cell changes. For the H-2Kb structures, the differences in unit cell dimensions (>0.5A along each axis) are of the same magnitude as the main chain difference (0.61 A) observed for MHC residues 142-151 and may have contributed to the observed binding site changes. Alternatively, peptide-associatedstructural changescould have caused changes in the unit cell. In HLA-AP, however, a 1 .O A displacement of the peptide C-terminus does not require an accompanying change in MHC main chain structure. There are a few significant conformational adjustments of individual MHC side chains in direct response to peptide side chain variability (Figure 8). For example, Trp-167, a conserved MHC side chain that forms the N-terminal end of the class I peptide-binding cleft, adopts the same posi-

tion for 4 of the 5 bound peptides studied, but shifts to pack against the main chain a carbon of the influenza A matrix peptide, which lacks a side chain at Pl (glycine) (Figure 8A). Trp-167 forms a part of the solvent-accessible surface of all peptide-MHC complexes described here and could thus directly contact a TCR. Arg-97 and Tyr-116, which are located beneath the center and C-terminus of a bound peptide and are thus not directly accessible to TCR recognition, engage in a coordinated shift between two conformations, one oriented more toward the peptide N-terminus (Figure 88) and one oriented more toward the peptide C-terminus (Figure 8C). The two conformations of Arg-97 and Tyr-116 appear to differ in stability and to be dependent on the presence or absence of a downward-pointing side chain at P7 or a side chain larger than valine at P9. In the C-terminal orientation, Arg-97 can form hydrogen bonds to Asp-77 (2.7 and 3.1 A, respectively, in the HIV-1 gpl20 and RTase structures) and to His-74 (3.0 and 3.2 A), while Tyr-116 can hydrogen bond to Asp-77 (3.3 and 2.8 A). In the N-terminal orientation, however, Arg-97 can only make weak hydrogen bonds (>3.3 A) to His-l 14 and (with poor geometry) to His-70. Thus, the C-terminal configuration of Arg-97 and Tyr-116 should be energetically favorable. Atoms of the P7-Phe of the influenza A matrix peptide and of the P7-Val of the HTLV-1 Tax peptide, however, would be only 3.13.3 A from the guanidinium group of Arg-97 in the C-terminal orientation. The influenza A matrix PS-Leu would also make close contacts with Tyr-116 in the C-terminal orientation (see below). Thus, steric interactions with peptide P7 and P9 side chains appear able to displace Arg-97 and Tyr-116 from the C-terminal to the N-terminal orientation. The structural changes for Arg-97, Tyr-116, and Trp167 are similar in magnitude to those observed for side chains Gln-152 and Arg-155 in H-2Kb caused by the presence of different peptides (Fremont et al., 1992). Some variation is also observed in the orientations of MHC side chains extending into solvent from the tops of the al and a2 a helices and not contacting the peptide. These changes are unlikely to be peptide induced, since solventexposed side chains generally show such variation and since some of the side chains on the top of the a2 a helix are involved in crystal contacts. Accommodation of Anchor Side Chain Variability Like most class I MHC molecules, the peptide anchor side chains of HLA-A2 are not absolute requirements, but rather stereochemical preferences. HLA-A2 preferentially binds peptides with leucine at P2, but tolerates methionine (and, less well, isoleucine); at P9, it prefers valine, but leucine and isoleucine reduce HLA-A2 binding affinity by nearly lo-fold (Falk et al., 1991; Ruppert et al., 1993). Of the peptides studied here, the influenza A matrix peptide contains such tolerated but less frequent side chains at both P2 (isoleucine) and P9 (leucine). As seen from a comparison of side chain contacts (Table 1) and conformations (see Figure 3D), the P2-lie and P2-Leu side chains occupy very similar volumes in the P2-binding pocket of HLA-AP. While all four PBLeu side chains contact MHC side chains

containing a PQ-Val (HIV-1 RTase, gp120, and hepatitis B nucleocapsid peptides), Arg-97 and Tyr-116 are oriented more toward the peptide C-terminus (Figure 8C), where they can form intrabinding site hydrogen bonds. However, superposition of the HLA-A2-binding clefts suggests that the influenza A matrix peptide with the less favorable leutine side chain at P9 would sterically block Tyr-116 from adopting a C-terminal orientation (closest contact, 1.78), forcing it into the N-terminal orientation and causing the loss of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Discussion The broad outlines of how peptides of different sequences bind tightly to class I MHC molecules have become clear in the last few years. Two generalizations can be made about the interaction of antigenic peptides with MHC. The binding of the peptide main chain at its ends has now been confirmed in single and pooled peptide cocrystals of four class I MHC molecules (Madden et al., 1991, 1992; Madden and Wiley, 1992; Fremont et al., 1992; Matsumura et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992; Guo et al., 1992; Silver et al., 1992), and since the MHC side chains involved are conserved in virtually all class I sequences, this aspect of tight peptide binding appears to be a universal peptide recognition element (Madden and Wiley, 1992) independent of MHC subtype or peptide sequence. Other peptideMHC contacts are MHC subtype specific, but general for all peptides satisfying the appropriate binding motif. These include hydrogen bonds from polymorphic MHC side chains (e.g., Glu-63 in HLA-AP) to the peptide main chain and to peptide anchor side chains and could again be observed in earlier cocrystal structures (Fremont et al., 1992; Matsumura et al., 1992; Madden et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992; Guo et al., 1992; Silver et al., 1992). The immune response, however, is ultimately guided by the uniqueness of each antigenic peptide as bound to a particular class I MHC molecule. For five viral peptides capable of eliciting cytotoxic T cell responses in HLA-A2' individuals, we have determined the structure of the antigenie complex with HLA-A2 that is recognized by the TCR and have found that the peptides adopt strikingly different conformations in the central part of the peptide-binding groove, where they are most exposed to direct T cell recognition. The main chains of these peptides are shifted and twisted in the binding cleft relative to one another, depending on the side chains present in the overall peptide sequence, and these main chain differences, in turn, influence the orientation of the side chains. All seven (or eight, for a decamer) nonanchor peptide side chains are found to contact HLA-A2 (Table 1) so that even single amino acid substitutions could conceivably alter the entire conformation of a bound peptide. Such singly substituted peptide analogs have been found to convert antigenic peptides to partial agonists and antagonists in T cell recognition of class II MHC molecules (De Magistris et al., 1992; Alexander et al., 1993; Racioppi et al., 1993) and they may also be important in viral mutations that can escape cytotoxic T cell recognition, as observed for HIV-1 gp120 peptides presented by HLA-B8 (Phillips et al., 1991).

Antigenic Identity Recently, it has been proposed that MHC binding of antigenie peptides could induce changes in the structure of the binding cleft itself that depend on (and therefore reflect) the sequence of the peptide. These MHC changes would contribute directly to the antigenic uniqueness of the TCR-binding site (Fremont et al., 1992; Catipovic et al., 1992; Bluestone et al., 1992). Changes that can be attributed to differences in the sequences and conformations of bound peptides are found for individual MHC side chains, both in the structures presented here and in the analysis of H-2Kb (Fremont et al., 1992). However, the evidence for larger scale (e.g., allosteric) deformations of the main chain of the peptide-binding cleft remains ambiguous owing to the involvement of crystal contacts. In five peptide-HLA-A2 structures, no correlation between displacement of the peptide C-terminus and main chain shifts of residues 144-151 is found, since the hepatitis B decamer-binding site is essentially identical to the HIV-1 RTase and influenza A nonamer-binding sites. In any case, a TCR could clearly distinguish among these peptide-MHC complexes on the basis of the different peptide structures in the center of the binding cleft. Thus, although peptide-specific MHC conformational changes may sometimes contribute to the uniqueness of the complex, the structure of the bound peptide is the essential determinant of the antigenic identity of the complex. Peptideinduced MHC side chain differences are probably sufficient to explain the existence of monoclonal antibodies whose binding to peptide-H-2Kb complexes depends on the sequence of the bound peptide (Catipovic et al., 1992; Bluestone et al., 1992). When mapped, the conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies are, with one possible exception (Bluestone et al., 1992) specific for the a2 a helix, precisely the region where HLA-A2 and H-2Kb peptide-induced side chain displacements are seen. Most peptides make substantial contacts with numerous MHC residues on the a2 a helix (Table l), chiefly from the peptide side chains (Pl, P3, and P5) shown to affect monoclonal antibody recognition (Bluestone et al., 1992; Catipovic et al., 1992). Thus, while MHC side chain adaptability in this region is likely to play a role in TCR recognition, it is not necessary to invoke large scale adjustments of the binding cleft to explain the peptide dependence of recognition by these antibodies. Secondary Anchor Preferences Virtually all peptide residues contact the MHC, consistent with the recent observation that most nonanchor peptide side chains (secondary anchors) are capable of modulating the affinity of peptide binding to HLA-A2 (Parker et al., 1992; Ruppert et al., 1993). Some secondary anchor side chain preferences, e.g., Pl and P3, can be explained in terms of traditional binding pockets, since the Pl side chains occupy overlapping volumes of space in all five peptides, as do those of P3 (Figure 5A). For example, electrostatic repulsion by Glu-63 in the Pl-binding pocket may explain the observed selection against peptides containing glutamic acid or aspartic acid at Pl , while stacking interactions with Trp-167, as seen for the hepatitis B nu-

Cell 704

cleocapsid peptide, may explain the preference for aromatic Pl side chains (Ruppert et al., 1993). Similarly, the P3-binding pocket is lined with the aromatic rings of Tyr-99 and Tyr-159, which again could form favorable stacking interactions with an aromatic P3 side chain, as seen for the HTLV-1 Tax peptide. The lack of binding of peptides with proline at Pl is most likely due to the fact that the proline side chain is covalently attached to the peptide N-terminus and therefore presumably disrupts the hydrogen bond network usually observed between a free peptide N-terminus and three conserved MHC tyrosine side chains. Forthecentral peptide residues, however, thesequence dependence of peptide conformation suggests that side chain preferences at these positions will depend on the peptide being studied. For example, Sette and colleagues (Ruppert et al., 1993) find that in nonameric peptides binding to HLA-A2, the presence of aromatic residues is favored at position P5. Two of the nonamer peptides presented here have aromatic side chains at P5: the PS-Tyr of the HTLV-1 Tax peptide points up toward the solution (and the TCR), while the P5-Phe of the influenza A matrix peptide points sideways and down into the cleft (Figure 3A). The fact that both aromatic residues are favored is therefore not caused by a constant interaction with an MHC-binding site specific for a P5 aromatic ring. Instead, it probably represents the ability of the P5 side chain to exploit several different hydrophobic packing interactions, depending on the overall sequence of the presented peptide. It may be that some peptides will adopt conformations that do not have any favorable contacts for aromatic P5 side chains. Sequence-dependent peptide conformations may explain occasional discrepancies observed between definitions of secondary anchors based on amino acid substitutions in a particular peptide and those based on statistical analysis of large collections of peptides (Ruppert et al., 1993). In a population of tightly binding nonapeptides, for example, glutamic acid is rarely found at positions 3 and 7 and is therefore presumed to decrease HLA-A2 binding affinity. However, substitution of P3-Glu or P7-Glu into the peptide ALAKAAAAV has little effect on its affinity for HLAA2 (Ruppert et al., 1993). Similarly, substitution into the ALAKAAAAV peptide of favorable secondary anchors (side chains frequently found in tightly binding nonapeptides) often fails to increase HLA-A2 binding affinity (e.g., Pl-Phe, P3-Phe, PCCys, PCThr, P8Tyr, P7-Ala, and P8Pro) (Ruppert et al., 1993). Such discrepancies may depend on the sequence of the particular peptide in which substitutions are made. For example, the small alanine side chains of the ALAKAAAAV peptide may provide additional conformational flexibility (relative to a more complex peptide sequence) so that side chains such as P9GIu or P7-Glu can avoid normally unfavorable interactions with MHC. As described above for P5, interactions favoring tight peptide binding may also require a particular (sequence-dependent) peptide main chain conformation. Consideration of secondary anchor preferences yields a substantial improvement (to roughly 70%) in the prediction of HLA-AP-binding peptides (Ruppert et al., 1993). Se-

quence dependence of secondary anchors may explain the residual inaccuracy. If so, it may be possible to improve predictions by studying singly substituted peptides in various background sequences.
Experimental Procedures

Protein Purification, Reconstitution, and Crystallization HLA-A2 heavy chain (residues l-275) and Pz-microglobulin were expressed in Escherichia coli (Garboczi et al., 1992). Two differences between the recombinant proteins and those expressed by human ceils are that the recombinant heavy chain is not glycosylated at Asn-86 and that the b,-microglobulin has an additional N-terminal methionine residue not cleaved following synthesis. Peptides described in Figure 1 were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 431 A peptide synthesizer, using N-9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chemistry. Peptide purity was checked by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the sequence was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Harvard Chemistry Department Mass Spectrometry Facility, Cambridge, Massachusetts). Recombinant B,-microglobulin and HLA-A2 heavy chain were reconstituted with individual peptides by dilution (Garboczi et al., 1992). Crystals were grown in hanging drops equilibrated by vapor diffusion against well solutions of 13% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, 25 m M n-morpholinoethanesulfanolamine. 0.1% sodium azide (pH 6.5). Crystals were harvested to a modified well solution containing 16% PEG 6000 (or, for gpI20 crystals, 20% PEG 6000). Microseeding was used for crystals containing hepatitis B (hepatitis B microseeds) and HIV-l RTase and HTLV-1 Tax (influenza A matrix microseeds) peptides. Shortly before data collection, crystals were transferred stepwise to harvest buffers supplemented with progressively higher concentrations of glycerol. The final glycerol concentration was 20% (16% for the influenza A matrix peptide cocrystals), the transfer steps were between 3% and 10% glycerol, and the time of each step varied from 1 hr to several days. Before transfer into glycerol-supplemented harvest buffers, crystals were placed in 50 PI dialysis buttons covered with Spectrum #7 dialysis membrane (molecular size cutoff, 10 kd), except for gp120 crystals, which were manipulated individually. Variations in the transfer protocol could not be correlated with the quality of diffraction data. Data Collection and Space Group Determination Oscillation data were collected from frozen crystals essentially as described previously (Madden et al., 1992). These crystals had not been previously characterized by precession photography. To determine the space group, several degrees of oscillation data were collected, and diffraction peaks were inspected on an Evans and Sutherland display to estimate the unit cell of the reciprocal lattice. This estimate was used in autoindexing the diffraction patterns. Assuming a space group of Pi, structure factor amplitudes were determined using the BUDDHA program (Blum et al., 1987) and the CCP4 program ROTAVATAlAGROVATA (Fox and Holmes, 1966). Putative symmetry elements can be tested by comparing the intensities of pairs of reflections that would be required lo be equal (DELTAHIST program). Analysis of the axial reflections along crystallographic symmetry axes permitted the determination of screw axes. The final space groups are shown in Table 2. Evidence for the correctness of the space group determination is provided by the success of the molecular replacement(MR) solutions at reproducing electron density for omitted domains (see below). Phase Determination Initial phases were determined for three cocrystals containing the HIV-1 gp120, RTase, and hepatitis B nucleocapsid peptides (representing each of the three space groups reported here) by MR using MERLOT (Fitzgerald, 1966). The search model was the 2.8 A structure of HLA-A2 (Saper et al., 1991); data from 20-4 A resolution were used. For the monoclinic HIV-1 gp120 peptide cocrystal, two clear solutions were found for the rotation and translation function searches. After sixdomainrigid body refinement usingX-PLOR(BrOnger, 1990)(ala2, a3, and 13rmicroglobulin domains for each molecule in the asymmetric unit), R.,,, was 0.398 (IO-3 A).

cocrysjal also yielded two clear MR solutions, with (lo-3 A) after rigid body refinement (as above). For hepatitis B nucleocapsid peptide cocrystal, a single was found, with an R,,,, of 0.415 (lo-3 A) after rigid

an Rcvsl of 0.422 the orthorhombic clear MR solution body refinement.

Initial Model Building and Refinement Iterative real space 2-fold phase averaging (Bricogne, 1976) was used to improve the initial MR electron density for HLA-A2 complexed with the HIV-I RTase nonamer peptide. Following six cycles of averaging, clear density was seen for the peptide, for residues 271-275 of the heavy chain (not included in the model), and for an N-terminal methionine residue of bacterially expressed &microglobulin, indicating the correctness of the MR solution. The 1.8A resolution structure of HLAA68 (Guo et al., 1992) was fit by the method of least-squares to the MR solution for HLA-A2, and side chains differing between the two models were replaced with those from HLA-A2. The structure was rigid body refined as 26 secondary structure elements, manually refit to the iteratively averaged electron density maps using FRODO (Jones, 1978) and subjected to alternate rounds of rebuilding and automated refinement using X-PLOR. For each structure, 10% of all observed reflections were excluded from the automated refinement to permit monitoring of R,,, (Briinger, 1992) throughout model building and refinement. The same subsets of reflections (identical Miller indices) were used for structures having the same space group. Refinement protocols were designed to minimize the R,,, rather than the conventional R,,.l, to avoid errors introduced by overfitting of the data. Automated refinement procedures included rigid body, overall temperature factor, and positional and individual atomic temperature (B) factor refinement, as well as one round of simulated annealing using a slowcooling protocol (Briinger et al., 1990). Initially, strict noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) constraints were applied, and in later stages of refinement, very tight NCS restraints (weight, 10,000) were applied separately to three domains (ala2, a3, and p,-microglobulin). NCS restraints were not applied to residues that were involved in crystal contacts not shared by both molecules in the asymmetric unit. The quality of the model was monitored throughout refinement and rebuilding both by difference maps and by calculation of a real space fit using 0 (Jones et al., 1991). The final model before inclusion of peptide atoms had an RI,- of 0.356 and R,,, of 0.290 (6-2.5 A). Prior to modeling any peptide structure, the refined structure of HtA-A2 in complex with the HIV-1 RTase peptide was used as the starting model for structure refinement in the isomorphous HTLV-1 Tax peptide cocrystal. Following a six domain rigid body refinement, R,,, was 0.353 and RcW was 0.321 (62.5 A). Positional and individual B factor refinement, together with a single round of manual rebuilding using iteratively averaged electron density maps, produced a model (without peptide atoms) with an R,. of 0.326 and R.,, of 0.273 (6-2.5 A). This model was transferred by least-squares fitting to the influenza

A matrix cocrystal structure (initial model from rigid body refinement of the HIV-1 gp120 peptide cocrystal MR model). Following six domain Qgid body refinement, the Rn, was 0.346 and R,,,, was 0.348 (lo-3 A). Strict NCS constraints were reapplied to the model, and manual rebuilding (using iteratively averaged electron density maps) and refinement were carried out as for the HIV-1 RTase peptide cocrystal, except without simulated anneating The resulting model had an RI,., of 0.337 and R,,, of 0.283 (6-2.5 A). This structure was transferred to the (isomorphous) HIV-1 gp120 peptide cocrystal and, following six domain rigid body refinement, had an Rheeof 0.371 and R,,, of 0.350 (IO-3 A). This structure was rebuilt and refined, as was the influenza A matrix peptide cocrystal. In both cases, strict NCS was ultimately replaced by NCS restraints with a weight of 10,000. The cocrystal of HLA-A2 with the hepatitis B nucleocapsid decamer does not have NCS. An initial model was derived from a least-squares fit of the influenza A cocrystal structure onto the hepatitis B MR solution, Following overall temperature factor refinement, three domain (ala2, a3, and 6z-microglobulin) and 26 domain (secondary structure elements) rigid body refinements, R,,, was 0.414 and R,, was 0.431 (IO-3 A). The HLA-A2 structure was expected to be very similar to those of the four nonameric structures. By analogy to the iterative averaging between different crystals of nitrogenase (Kim and Rees. 1992) and HLA-DRI (Brown et al., 1993) electron density maps of hepatitis B decapeptide cocrystals were averaged with those from the HTLV-1 Tax nonapeptide cocrystals, using the following procedure: molecular envelopes were calculated for the ala2, a3, and &microglobulin domains of the HTLV-1 Tax nonamer structure, except that to avoid bias the HTLV-1 Tax peptide and all MHC side chains within 4 A of the peptide were excluded from the ala2 envelope, using ENVAT (D. R. M., unpublished data). Separate least-squares transformations (Kabsch, 1978) were calculated from each domain to the corresponding domain of the hepatitis B nucleocapsid peptide MR solution. A molecular envelope was also calculated for the hepatitis B peptide structure, including the peptide-binding cleft. An iteratively real space averaged electron density map from the HTLV-1 Tax peptide cocrystal was averaged, domain by domain, with the electron density from the hepatitis B peptide structure (Bricogne, 1976) using APPEND, written by T. S. Jardetzky. The averaged and solventflattened map was used to determine new calculated structure factors, which were, in turn, used to produce a new hepatitis B electron density map. This procedure was repeated for six cycles, yielding clear electron density for all features of HLA-A2 and also for the bound peptide. The model was rebuilt manually into this averaged density, yielding a structure with an Rhse of 0.343 and R,,,, of 0.359 (IO-3 A). Further Refinement and Peptide Modeling The structures described above were subjected to further cycles of automated refinement using X-PLOR (no simulated annealing) and to

manual rebuilding against unaveraged and iteratively averaged difference maps. The hepatitis B nucleocapsid peptide structure was initially subjected to refinement only against geometric (e.g., bond length and angle) and not X-ray restraints, Preliminary resolution extension to 1.8 A was applied to the HTLV-I Tax peptide structure. When the RI, appeared to have reached a minimum (0.326-0.356, depending on the structure), clear electron density could be seen for each peptide (Figure 1). A model of the appropriate peptide was then included in refinement. The R,,.. of the structures improved by approximately 1% before and after inclusion of a peptide model and its refinement: for the HIV-1 RTase peptide, from 0.356 to 0.347; for the HTLV-1 Tax peptide, from 0.326 to 0.318; for the influenza A matrix peptide, from 0.334 to 0.324; for the HIV-1 gp120 peptide, from 0.353 to 0.342 (initially only backbone atoms were included); for the hepatitis B nucleocapsid peptide, from 0.339 to 0.324. After inclusion of a peptide model, energy minimization and individual B factor refinement were performed on all structures. Individual B factor refinement for the hepatitis B nucleocapsid peptide was closely monitored because of the 3.0 A resolution limit and was judged reasonable because it produced a substantial improvement in Rti (0.009). Density remained clear for the peptide in averaged and unaveraged difference maps, and subsequent refinement allowed the placement of side chain atoms for the HIV-1 gpl20peptideaswell. With theexceptionof afewof thesmallest (threonine and valine) peptide side chains, all peptide side chain orientations could be unambiguously determined. There is a single cis peptide bond in the five peptides, N-terminal of the P5-Pro in the HIV-1 RTase nonapeptide.

Quality of the Final Structures The statistics of all five refined structures are presented in Table 3. All have the characteristics of well-refined protein structural models, including excellent peptide geometry and low values for R,,,. No water molecules have been included in any of the structures, although most "peaks" (>4oJ of Fo-Fc difference maps are likely to be water molecules (<3.5 A from a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor atom of the peptide-MHC complex). Most difference map "holes" (<-40) are >1.5 A from the protein model and therefore do not directly reflect misplacement of the model. All peptide main chains adopt standard geometry, as pentapeptide subfragments of them match closely to pentapeptides found in a data base of highly refined crystal structures using the DGLP facility of FRODO (Jones and Thirup, 1986). The values of Rev,, which vary between 0.282 and 0.286, are, however, comparatively high. This is a direct result of our decision to minimize Rhw and not RCm during model refinement. Because R,,, monitors the same residual that is minimized by refinement techniques, its value can be decreased either by genuine improvements in the model, by modifying the structure to correct for noise in the experimental structure factor amplitudes (overfitting), or by reducing the ratio of observations to parameters in the refinement (making overfitting more likely). In contrast, the R ,,w is generally not improved by overfitting (Briinger, 1992). In our experience, minimization of R,,., is frequently incompatible with minimization of RmP. For example, at several points during refinement, relaxation of NCS restraints on the model produced a substantial reduction in Rm (at the level of 1.8%2.5% for the influenza A matrix and HTLV-1 Tax peptide structures),

but simultaneously increased R,,... Comparisons with structures refined at high resolution suggest that the current t&values of the five peptide-MHC structures are indicative of well-refined models. The structure of HLA-B27 refined to 2.1 A resolution has an RI,.. of 0.295 from 6-2.5 A, excluding all water molecules (D. R. M., unpublished data). Also, in the initial description of refinement using an R,,,, Brtinger and coworkers used simulated annealing to determine an R,,, for the very well-refined structure of penicillopepsin (Briinger, 1992). This structure had an R c"DIo!O.i 39 against data to 1.8 A resolution (R,,,, is 0.068 from 2.1-1.8 A resolution) (James and Sielecki, 1983). All water molecules were removed from the model, 10% of all reflections were selected as a free set, and simulated annealing refinement was performed against the remaining reflections. When data to 2.8 A resolution were used, the resulting RfiW exceeded 0.30 (Brunger, 1992). Both the penicillopepsin and the HLA-827 models were refined against data beyond 2.5 A resolution. The fact that each peptide-HLA-A2 structure presented here has an R,,- only a few percent higher than the high resolution refined structures suggests that they are substantially correct and also supports the use of R,, as a minimization target during crystallographic refinement. Solventaccessible surface areas were calculated with ACCESS, written by M. Handschumacher and F. M. Richards. To compare the peptideand HLA-AP-binding site structures, the ala2 domains have been superimposed by a least-squares fit (Kabsch, 1978) matching only the main chain atoms in the (1 helices and eight 8 strands. The coordinates of all five structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven, New York, and are currently available as prerelease coordinates. Identifiers are PDBIHHG, PDBlHHH, PDBl HHI, PDBI HHJ, and PDBl HHK. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Drs. W. Biddison and U.
