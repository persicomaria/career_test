The electron distribution in the coenzyme-substrate adduct of aspartate aminotransferase was changed by replacing active-site Arg386 with alanine and introducing a new arginine residue nearby. [Y225R, = R386AjAspartate arninotransferase decarboxylates r>-aspartate to L-alanine (kc&,, 0.04 s I), while its transaminase activity towards dicarboxylic amino acids is decreased by three orders of magnitude ( k , , , = 0.19 s '). Molecular-dynamics simulations based on the crystal structure of the mutant enzyme suggest that a new hydrogen bond to the iiiiine N atom of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-aspartate adduct and an altered electrostatic potential around its [karboxylate group underlie the 650000-fold increase in the ratio of 8-decarboxylaseltransaminase activity.

Keywords: aspartate aminotransferase ; aspartate 8-decarboxylase ; pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ; enzyme mechanism : site-directed mutagenesis.

The pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes (B, enzymes) catalyze a wide variety of reactions of amino acids and may thus be expected to be of heuristic value in delineating the structural basis for enzymic reaction specificity. In B,, enzymes, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (pyridoxal-P) is bound covalently lo the c-amino group of an active-site lysine residue (Scheme 1 I), which, by transimination, is replaced with the amino group of the incoming substrate to give the aldimine intermediate 11. In the subsequent reaction step, the pathways of the different B , enzymes diverge and give rise to specific transfortnations of the amino acid substrates, such as transamination with 0x0 acids, racemization. aldol cleavage. a or p decarboxylation as well as 8or 7 elimination and replaccmcnt reactions. Recent studies of the molecular evolution of B , enzymes have provided a rational approach for changing their reaction specificities. The B , enzymes constitute but a few families of homologous proteins [I]. The largest family is the a family which comprises at least ten groups of enzymes possessing similar protein scaffolds but catalyzing quitc diverse reactions. It seemed feasible, therefore, to change the reaction specificity of a given B, enzyme by substituting few active-site residues, e.g. charged residues that determine the electron repartition in the resonance system of the coenzyme-substrate adduct. We have tested this proposition with aspartate atninotransferase (AspAT), an enzyme of the a family which catalyzes the 2-oxoglutarate * oxalatransamination reaction L-aspartate cetate L-glutamate. The aldimine intermediate 11 is thereby deprotonated at Co to produce the quinonoid intermediate 111; reprotonation at C4' of the coenzyme gives the ketimine inter-

mediate IV which is hydrolyzed to the 0x0 acid product and the pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (pyridoxamine-P) form of the enzyme V. The 0x0 acid substrate undergoes the reverse reaction (V-+I). To make the quinonoid intermediate I11 adopt a different reaction course, we exchanged Arg386 with an alaninc residue and, in its vicinity, introduced a new arginine residuc in place of Tyr225 (Fig. 1). Arg386, which binds the cx-carboxylate group of the substrate [2-41, is one of the only four invariant residues i n aminotransferases [ S , 61 and appears to be absent in some enzymes that are homologous with aminotransferases but cata.lyze reactions other than transamination 11 1. Tyr225 forms a hydrogen bond with 03' of the cofactor and is not fully conserved, even among the aminotransferases [ S ] .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type asp C gene of Escherichiu coli was inserted into the BS M I 3 vector [7] and mutated with the Mutagenesis Kit of Bio-Rad 181. The mutated genes were expressed in the AspAT-deficient Esthericlziu coli strain TY103 [9] with the expression vector pKDHE1'3 [lo]. Mutant AspATs were purified as reported elsewhere [I 11. Determination of protein concentration and aminotransferase activity. The concentration of the purified enzymes in thse pyridoxal form was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the molar absorption coefficient of the subunit c == 4.7X10JM I c m I [12]. Aminotransferase activity was measured with 40 mM L-aspartate and 20 mM 2-oxoglutarate as substrates and 2 pM pyridoxal-P i n a coupled assay with nialate dehydrogenase. The values of k,,, refer to subunit concentrations. KL, values for aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate were determined at fixed concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate (60 mM) and of L-aspartate (120 mM), respectively.

Dotted lines denote hydrogen bonds. Asterisks indicate residues of the adjacent wbunit of the AspAT dimer. While the residues of the large domain (left) superimpose well, the small domains (right) deviate from each other due to an only partial closing of the active-site cleft (4.2" instead of 6.2") in [Y225R, R386AIAspAT. In the double-mutant enzyme, one oxygen atom of the (1-carboxylate group of the substrate forms a hydrogen bond with Nd'2 of Asn194, the second shares hydrogen bonds with Gly3X N and a water molecule (water molecules are not shown). Odl of the P-carboxylate group of the substrate forms a hydrogen bond with Ncl of Trpl40, while 062 interacts with the guanidinium group of Arg292" and two water molecules. The side chains of Phe360 and Va1382, and a water molecule, fill the space that is void due to the R386A mutation.

[R225Y, R386AIAspAT (pyridoxal-P form, 1.2 mM subunit concentration) was added to 10 mM L-aspartate in the absence of oxalacetate. Oxalacetate and pyruvate produced were trapped with 150 U/1 malate dehydrogenase, 30 U/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 4 mM NADH. L-Alanine was determined within 30 s after starting the reaction after derivatization with 2-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenylL5-~-alaninearnide [ 141. Measurement of consumption and production of 0x0 acids.

Crystals were grown with the hanging drop method. Diffraction data for [Y225R, R386AIAspAT were collected to 0.23-nm resolution using a FAST area detector (Enraf Nonius) and, for wild-type AspAT, to 0.22 nm using an imaging plate (MAR Research).

pleted to 89.3% and 94.1 %, respectively. Both structures were refined using TNT [15] to R-factor values of 0.214 and 0.220 for all reflections in the resolution range. The RMS deviations of bond lengths, bond angles and planes from ideal values were 0.01 nm, 2.14' and 0.01 nm, respectively. Molecular-dynamics calculations. Molecular-dynamics simulations were performed with the Consistent Valence Forcefield of the program DISCOVER (Biosym). Crystal water molecules and a 0.5-nm water shell were added to the system. The structures of the 5'-phosphopyridoxyl- aspartate complexes were changed to those of the quinonoid intermediates TT by reI moving Ha and introducing a double bond between the imine N and Cn. To keep the n system planar, a dihedral constraint of 83.7 kJ mol ' Tad-' was applied to force the angle defined by the atoms C4, C4', N and Ca to 180". The structures of the two single-mutant enzymes were derived from the crystal structure of the 5'-phosphopyridoxyl- aspartate complex of the wild-type enzyme. All water molecules were relaxed by 500 steps of energy minimization. The whole system was energy minimized to a RMS energy gradient of 0.004 kJ mol-' nm-'. The amino acid residues and water molecules within a distance of more than 0.8 nm from the coenzyme-substrate adduct and the active-site residues 258, 225, 222, 140, 386, 292" and 70" were kept fixed during 80 ps of simulation at 300 K. A dielectric constant of 1 and a cutoff of 0.9 nm for nonbonded interactions were applied. For the analysis, the structures formed during the last 40 ps were used. Electrostatic potentials were calculated with the program DELPHI (Biosym) on the basis of the averaged structures at 60- 80 ps of the molecular-dynamics simulations. Dielectric constants for protein and solvent of 4 and 80, respectively, and a solvent ionic strength of 0.145 M were used.

The pyridoxal-P forms of the enzymes were incubated at 0.45 mM subunit concentration with 40 mM L-aspartate and 3.4 mM oxalacetate in 50 mM 4-methylmorpholine, pH 7.5, at 25 "C. With the two single-mutant enzymes and with equimolar pyridoxal-P instead of enzyme, no decrease in the concentration of L-aspartate and no producor tion of ~-alanine n-alanine were detected within 6 h. In the presence of D-aspartate, L-alanine and D-alanine, r>-glutamate and n-glutamate, L-cysteine and D-cysteine, L-serine, L-phenylalanine and 1,-phenylalanine, DL-serine-0-sulfate, 2-methyl-~~-aspartate, ~-2-chloroalanine, Lerythro-3-hydroxyaspartate or ~-threo-3-hydroxyaspartateand the cognate 0x0 acids, no consumption of substrate and formation of a new product were observed. The reactions were followed as described elssewhere [ I l , 141.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
[Y225R, R386A]AspAT, and the single-mutant [R386A]AsPAT and [Y225R]AspAT were tested for newly generated catalytic activities with an assay that monitored both the consumption of the amino acid substrate and the formation of new products [ l l , 141. [Y225R, R386AIAspAT catalyzes the [j-decarboxylation of L-aspartate to L-alanine 650 times more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme. With oxalacetate as cosubstrate, pdecarboxylation of L-aspartate is the only net reaction taking place (Fig. 2). In contrast, aminotraiisferase activity was decreased by three orders of magnitude (Table 1). The 650000fold increase in the ratio of p-decarboxylaselaminotransferase activity requires double mutation of the enzyme ; both single mutations, R386A and Y225R, decrease the P-decarboxylase activity to below the detection limit. The pathway of alanine production was elucidated under single-turnover conditions. p-decarboxylation proceeds via the intermediates 111, VI, VII and VIII, i.e. does not depend on the intermediary formation of oxalacetate or pyruvate. However, the single-turnover experiments did not exclude p-decarboxylation coupled with transamination (pathway IX-V) as a minor pathway. On incubation of [Y225R, R386AIAspAT with L-aspartate and oxalacetate, pyruvate was produced, and oxalacetate, which converted the pyridoxamine-P form of the enzyme back to its pyridoxal-P form, was consumed. The initial rate of pyruvate production corresponds to a k,,, value of 0.01 s - l , that of the wild-type enzyme being 0.0016 s I . Thus, in [Y225R, R386A]AspAT, the quinonoid intermediate VII is partitioned as in authentic L-aspartate P-decarboxylase [17], depending on the site of its reprotonation either at Cu or C4'. The partition ratios of the two pathways are 4 and 2500, respectively. The evolutionary relationship between AspAT and authentic aspartate p-decar-

boxylase is not known because no data on the primary or spatial structures of the decarboxylase are available as yet. The double-mutant and wild-type apoenzymes were cocrystallized with 5'-phosphopyridoxyl -aspartate, an analog of the covalent coenzyme-substrate adducts [2], and the spatial structures of the complexes were determined. The Arg225 side chain of [Y225R, R386AIAspAT proved to be in the same position as the phenyl ring of Tyr225 of the wild-type enzyme and to form also a hydrogen bond with 03' of pyridoxal-P (Fig. 1). In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, [Y225R, R386AIAspAT is only in an incompletely closed conformation. Arg386 has been described previously to play an important role in the ligand-induced closure of the active-site cleft [2-4, 18, 191. The Cu-H bond of the substrate lies together with the imine N atom in a plane that is almost orthogonal to the pyridine ring of the cofactor. This orientation favors deprotonation at C[x [20],as it is

The slices through the enzyme are defined by the three atoms of the ,!-carboxylate group of the substrate (black angles). Isopotential contour lines are shown from -125 to 125 kJ mol-' e-', with intervals of 41.8 kJ mol-' ec'. Negative, positive and zero potentials are represented by red, blue and black lines, respectively. The contours were calculated with the program DELPHI (Biosym) on the basis of the averaged structures at 60- 80 ps of the molecular-dynamics simulations.

required for both transamination and P-decarboxylation (Scheme 1). The crystal structures served as the basis for molecular-dynamics simulations of the quinonoid intermediate 111. In the simulated structures of both [Y225R, R386AIAspAT and [R386A]AspAT (Fig. 3), one oxygen atom of the P-carboxylate group of the substrate interacts with the guanidinium group of Arg292*, while the second oxygen atom engages in a hydrogen bond mainly with the hydroxy group of Tyr70*. The averaged dihedral angles defined by the atoms N, Ca, CP and Cy are 44" (range 27-73"), 69", 39" and 158" in [Y225R, R386A]AspAT, [Y225R]AspAT, [R386A]AspAT and wild-type AspAT, respectively. The angle in the double-mutant enzyme is thus closer to 90°, which would be more optimum for P-decarboxylation, than in the wild-type enzyme ; however, the minimum deviation from 90" is found in [Y225R]AspAT, which does not decarboxylate the substrate. Apparently, effects other than the orientation of the P-carboxylate group relative to the coenzyme-imine n system predominate in determining the rate of P-decarboxylation. The molecular-dynamics calculations of the quinonoid intermediate in both the double-mutant enzyme and [Y225R]AspAT show Arg225 to form hydrogen bonds not only to 03' of the cofactor but also to the N atom of its imine link with the substrate (Fig. 3). The latter interaction is not apparent in the crystal structure of the 5'-phosphopyridoxyl-aspartate complex of the enzyme. The hydrogen bonds from Arg225 to the imine N and the cofactor 0 3 ' may be assumed to reinforce the electron sink capacity of the n system of imine and the cofactor pyridine ring to such an extent that, even after deprotonation at Cu (step 1 1 III), it remains effective enough to stabilize the carbanion VI produced by P-decarboxylation. This mechanism is analogous to that proposed for nonenzymic decarboxylation of P-0x0 acids facilitateu by imine formation ([21], references cited therein) and to P-decarboxylation of isocitrate by isocitrate dehydrogenase, in which a Mg2+seems to adopt the role of Arg225 [22]. The hydrogen bond between Arg225 and the imine N atom exists in the double-mutant enzyme for 76% of the time and in [Y225R]AspAT only for 41 % of the time (Fig. 3). This substantial weakening of the hydrogen bond in the single-mutant enzyme, due to an additional interaction of Arg225 with the acarboxylate group, might explain in part why P-decarboxylase activity is only observed in the double-mutant enzyme. In addition, negative electrostatic potentials around the a-carboxylate group (Fig. 4) may be assumed to promote electron delocalization from this group [23]. In [Y225R]AspAT, the P-carboxylate

group is surrounded by positive potentials, due to the vicinity of both Arg225 and Arg386. In conclusion, the newly generated P-decarboxylase activity of [Y225R, R386AIAspAT and the concomitant decrease in aminotransferase activity bear out the initial hypothesis that the reaction specificity of B, enzymes may be changed by substitution of a limited number of critical residues determining the electron repartition in the coenzyme-substrate adduct.
