The enzymatic aldose ketose isomerisation of glucose and fructose sugars involves the transfer of a hydrogen between their C1 and C2 carbon atoms and, in principle, can proceed through either a direct hydride shift or via a cis-enediol intermediate. Pyrococcus furiosus phosphoglucose isomerase (PfPGI), an archaeal metalloenzyme, which catalyses the interconversion of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, has been suggested to operate via a hydride shift mechanism. In contrast, the structurally distinct PGIs of eukaryotic or bacterial origin are thought to catalyse isomerisation via a cis-enediol intermediate. We have shown by NMR that hydrogen exchange between substrate and solvent occurs during the reaction catalysed by PfPGI eliminating the possibility of a hydride-shift-based mechanism. In addition, kinetic measurements on this enzyme have shown that 5-phospho-D-arabinonohydroxamate, a stable analogue of the putative cis-enediol intermediate, is the most potent inhibitor of the enzyme yet discovered. Furthermore, determination and analysis of crystal structures of PfPGI with bound zinc and the substrate F6P, and with a number of competitive inhibitors, and EPR analysis of the coordination of the metal ion within PfPGI, have suggested that a cis-enediol intermediate-based mechanism is used by PfPGI with Glu97 acting as the catalytic base responsible for isomerisation.

this pathway involves the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI; EC 5.3.1.9) which catalyses the reversible isomerisation of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P). P. furiosus PGI (PfPGI) forms a homodimer, of two 21.5 kDa subunits, that shares no sequence similarity with the eukaryotic and bacterial PGIs.4,5 Recent structural analysis has revealed that PfPGI contains a cupin fold consisting of two b sheets made up of three and six b strands, respectively,6 demonstrating that the architecture of the enzyme is entirely different from the aba fold of the eukaryotic and bacterial PGIs. Aldose ketose isomerisation of sugars involves the transfer of a hydrogen between C1 and C2 of the sugar and, in principle, can proceed through either a direct hydride shift or via a cis-enediol

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the two possible reaction mechanisms for the isomerisation from G6P to F6P. (a) Direct hydride shift, where a hydride (red hydrogen) is transferred directly between C2 and C1 and (b) via a cis-enediol intermediate, where the proton on C2 (red hydrogen) is abstracted by a base (B) prior to forming the cis-enediol intermediate. The proton on the base (B) is free to exchange with solvent (red to blue hydrogen) before being donated to the intermediate.

intermediate (Figure 1).7 In the latter mechanism the hydrogen is transferred as a proton via a catalytic base and is free to exchange with the solvent, whereas in the hydride shift mechanism the hydrogen is transferred directly between C1 and C2 as a hydride and cannot exchange with the solvent. Studies on eukaryotic PGIs have shown that the reaction catalysed by these enzymes proceeds through a cis-enediol intermediate in a metal-independent manner,8 following ringopening of the substrate by the enzyme. The

reaction mechanism of eukaryotic PGIs has been extensively studied with the aid of structures of PGI bound to the substrates F6P9­11 and G6P,11,12 sorbitol 6-phosphate (S6P)13 (the open form mimic of the substrate), and a potent competitive inhibitor of this class of PGIs, 5-phospho-D-arabinonohydroxamate (5PAH).14 In contrast, the pyrococcal enzyme requires a divalent metal ion for catalysis15­17 and early work suggested that the enzyme mechanism may proceed via a direct hydride shift.16 However, recent structural comparisons of the active sites of PfPGI and rabbit PGI have revealed that, despite the structural differences between the two enzymes, a glutamate residue adjacent to the 5-phospho-D-arabinonate (5PAA) moiety is found in the PfPGI/5PAA complex (Glu97) in a similar position to the catalytic glutamate in the rabbit PGI/5PAA complex (Glu357) (PDB code: 1G98).15 This has raised the possibility that PfPGI might also catalyse the reaction through a cis-enediol intermediate. To date, the structures of the free enzyme of PfPGI15,16 and PfPGI bound to the inhibitors 6-phosphogluconate16 and 5PAA15,16 have been determined, but conclusive evidence as to the mechanism has yet to emerge. To shed further light on this problem we have carried out a series of structural and biophysical analyses including the determination of the structures of the co-crystal complexes of PfPGI bound to zinc and either 5PAH, F6P/G6P, mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) or S6P (Figure 2); the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis of the PfPGI complexes with Mn and with and without the substrates and the NMR analysis of solvent exchange during catalysis by PfPGI.

1355 Any incorporation of deuterium into the product would result in the potential loss of either or both of the H-1 and H-2 proton resonances in G6P and the H-1 (H-1pro-R and/or H-1pro-S) proton resonances in F6P. Separate samples of PfPGI with either F6P or G6P were incubated for 2 h at 60 8C in 2H2O and the resulting spectra represented a mixture of 70% G6P and 30% F6P, indicating that both reactions had reached equilibrium. The time scale of the reaction used in this experiment (2 h) was chosen to ensure that the reaction had fully proceeded to equilibrium. In the case of addition of PfPGI to G6P, a reduction in intensity of the H-2 resonance of the b-anomer (H-2b) of G6P to 7% of its original intensity (most likely arising from residual H2O in the solvent), was seen (comparing Figure 4(b) to (c)). This decrease in resonance intensity was accompanied by a change in the coupling pattern of the anomeric protons of G6P (H-1a, chemical shift 5.2 ppm (3J12Z3.8 Hz) and H1b, 4.6 ppm (3J12Z8.0 Hz)) from a doublet to a singlet (comparing Figure 4(b) to (c)). These observations indicate the replacement of H-2 in G6P by a deuterium. The behaviour of the H-2 resonance of the a anomer (H-2a) was obscured through resonance overlap. Following additional heating of the sample (3 h at 60 8C) there was further loss of signal intensity of the H-1a and H-1b resonances of G6P and a concomitant reduction in coupling pattern of the residual H-2 signal of the b anomer from a doublet of doublets (3J12Z8.0 Hz, 3J23Z 9.4 Hz) to a doublet (3J23Z9.4 Hz) (Figure 4(d)). This is indicative of incorporation of deuterium at H-1 of G6P, although at a much reduced rate compared to incorporation of deuterium at H-2 of G6P. The behaviour of the G6P resonances in the reaction mixture was the same when F6P was added as the substrate (Figure 4(e)). During the reaction followed by this NMR experiment, no M6P (an enantiomer of G6P) was detected, showing that the reaction is stereospecific and indicating that the isomerisation was indeed enzyme-catalysed. In addition, control experiments in the absence of PfPGI showed that, over the same time scale, no product was detected, and no incorporation of deuterium into the two substrates occurred. As these solvent exchange experiments were conducted with recombinant PfPGI, expressed in Escherichia coli, which contains mostly iron as the bound metal,6 the NMR analysis was repeated with zinc-containing PfPGI, which revealed that deuterium incorporation into the product also occurred with this enzyme sample. Analysis of the F6P resonances in the spectra resulting from PfPGI added to either F6P or G6P in 2 H2O and incubated at 60 8C for 2 h, revealed that the peaks corresponding to H-1pro-R and H-1pro-S in F6P are overlapped to a large extent with signals from G6P in the 1D 1H spectrum. However, deuterium incorporation could be determined using a 2D 1H­13C HSQC experiment. The crosspeaks of the protons bound to C1 (Figure 5(b)) showed a substantial reduction in intensity, at the

Results and Discussion
Inhibition studies on PfPGI The kinetic parameters of purified PfPGI were determined (Km 0.5 mM, Vmax 3.0 mM minK1, kcat 8.4 sK1) in the direction F6P to G6P at 50 8C and are consistent with previous work.5 Incubation of PfPGI with 100-fold excess of EDTA for 10 min at room temperature resulted in complete loss of activity. However, 93% of activity could be regained by the subsequent addition of 1000-fold excess of ZnCl2 (Km 0. 7 mM, Vmax 3.0 mM minK1, kcat 7.9 sK1), which is consistent with a divalent metal ion metal being essential for activity.15­17 In previous studies on the eukaryotic PGIs, comparisons of the competitive inhibition by 5PAA18 and 5PAH19 have shown that the latter is a tenfold more potent inhibitor.20 As the reaction catalysed by eukaryotic PGIs has been shown to proceed through a cis-enediol intermediate,8 it has been suggested that both 5PAA and 5PAH form closer mimics of the proposed cis-enediol intermediate than the substrate.20 In this intermediate, the C1 and C2 carbon atoms adopt a trigonal geometry, which is distinct from the substrate (F6P or G6P), which has one tetrahedral and one trigonal carbon at these positions (Figure 2). In 5PAA, the carbon with a spatial equivalence to C2 of the enediol is also trigonal and a carboxyl oxygen mimics the position of C1, but there is no atom equivalent to O1 of the cis-enediol intermediate. In 5PAH, however, N and C1 of the hydroxamate moiety both have trigonal geometry and mimic the positions of C1 and C2 of the cis-enediol intermediate, respectively. In addition, ON1 of 5PAH is in an equivalent position to O1 of the proposed intermediate. Thus the geometry of both 5PAA and 5PAH more closely resemble that of the proposed cis-enediol intermediate than that of F6P or G6P, with 5PAH being the closest mimic. Analysis of the reaction kinetics of PfPGI in the presence of 5PAA or 5PAH (Figure 3) shows that these compounds are also competitive inhibitors of the pyrococcal enzyme, with Kis of 270 mM and 3 mM, respectively. As seen in the eukaryotic enzymes, 5PAH is the better competitive inhibitor of PfPGI and also more potent than any other inhibitor of this enzyme reported to date.17 Studies of hydrogen exchange in catalysis by PfPGI If the reaction catalysed by PfPGI proceeds via a cis-enediol intermediate, then the hydrogen atoms bound to C1 in F6P (H-1pro-R and H-1pro-S) and C2 in G6P (H-2) may exchange with the solvent during catalysis, whereas no exchange would occur with a direct hydride-shift mechanism. To investigate this possibility, the inter-conversion was followed by 1D 1 H and 2D 1H­13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR with 2H2O as the solvent.

same time as the appearance of two new peaks (Figure 5(c)). The new peaks were shifted upfield in 13 C frequency from the fully protonated C1 resonances, exhibited 2H coupling in the 13C dimension ( 1J 13C­ 2HZ20.3 Hz(b), 22.1 Hz(a), and correspond to a single H-1 resonance for each anomer. A 20­22 Hz 1J13C­2H coupling constant for [1-2H]fructose-6-phosphate has been observed previously.21 Thus, the changes in the spectrum are

indicative of the loss of one proton and incorporation of one deuterium at the C1 position of F6P. One of the H-1 resonances is visible in the 1D spectrum as a broadened singlet (due to unresolved 2J1H­2H coupling) and this resonance decreases after additional heating of the sample (3 h at 60 8C), which demonstrates that the remaining H-1 hydrogen of F6P is replaced by deuterium at a much slower rate than the first hydrogen.

The insets for (c) and (d) show the H-2b region at 20 times vertical expansion.

Although the two H-1 resonances of fully protonated F6P were readily identifiable for each anomer in the 1D 1H spectrum, literature values were not available to enable their classification as pro-R or pro-S. Previous studies have investigated the stereochemistry of the reaction catalysed by eukaryotic PGIs and have shown that the enzyme abstracts the pro-R hydrogen from C1 of F6P.22 In the related enzyme, phosphomannose isomerase (PMI), which catalyses the reversible isomerisation of F6P and mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), the pro-S C1 hydrogen of F6P is abstracted during catalysis (Bentley23 and references therein). Therefore, for the identity of the pro-R and pro-S H-1 resonances of F6P to be established, the 1H­13C HSQC spectrum produced from PfPGI added to G6P was compared to the 1H­13C HSQC spectrum of M6P incubated with E. coli PMI in 2H2O: the product of both isomerisation reactions being F6P. The resulting spectra exhibited two resonances each, with the same 1J13C­2H coupling constant and upfield shift in 13C from the C1 resonances of fully protonated F6P, but with different 1H chemical shifts (comparing Figure 5(c) to (d)). A typical twobond (1H­13C­2H) deuterium isotope shift effect, for the substitution of a methylene proton, of K0.023 ppm24,25 was seen in the 1H dimension and hence, each of the product peaks could be related to an H-1 resonance in the fully protonated

F6P (Figure 5(b)). Using this information, the pro-R and pro-S H-1 resonances of F6P could be assigned in accordance with the previous exchange results23 (Figure 5(b)). Subsequent re-examination of the spectra resulting from the PMI and PfPGI-catalysed reactions reveals that PMI exchanges the alternative H-1 of F6P, with deuterium from the solvent, compared to that exchanged by PfPGI (comparing Figure 5(b) to (d)) and it can, therefore, be inferred that PfPGI primarily exchanges the pro-R H-1 of F6P. The slower loss of the anomeric H-1 resonance of G6P and the deuterium-coupled H-1 resonance of F6P, in the presence of PfPGI, demonstrates that the 1 H in the C1 pro-S position can also be abstracted by PfPGI, but at a vastly reduced rate compared with the hydrogen at the C1 pro-R position.

1358 We have thus shown that hydrogen exchange between the solvent and the substrate occurs during catalysis by PfPGI. To investigate whether the rate of exchange of a proton from the protein is faster than the rate of catalysis, the apparent rate of reaction was reduced to less than the NMR experiment timescale by incubating 13 ng/ml of PfPGI with 10 mM F6P in 2H2O at 25 8C or with 10 mM G6P in 2H2O at 25 8C and the subsequent increase of the anomeric proton resonance of G6P and the growth of the H-1 resonance(s) of F6P were monitored. These experiments showed that the H-1 of G6P appeared as a singlet, due to deuteration at C2 of G6P, and the H-1 of F6P appeared as a singlet (H-1pro-S), rather than the multiplet of the fully protonated product. This indicates that the protons abstracted from the substrates in each case are exchanged with deuterons from the solvent before being incorporated into the products, suggesting that direct hydride transfer does not occur in the PfPGI-catalysed reaction and showing that the reaction studied is enzyme-catalysed. Changes in metal coordination of PfPGI on substrate binding EPR spectral analyses of PfPGI and PfPGI in complex with F6P were undertaken to investigate the coordination state of the bound metal ion during catalysis. The EPR spectrum of PfPGI with bound manganese (0.85 Mn/subunit) shown in Figure 6(a) exhibits a six-line hyperfine structure (100% 55Mn with nuclear spin IZ5/2) with a splitting of AZ9.2 mT plus additional semiforbidden hyperfine lines typical for hexacoordinate Mn(II),26 with electron spin SZ5/2 and with a weak zero-field interaction, Dz0.01 cmK1. In addition, with high microwave power levels, extra signals are observed, notably between 0.1 T and 0.2 T. A similar feature has been observed in oxalate oxidase, a manganese-dependent enzyme also based on a cupin fold, and it has been assigned to Mn(II) with "moderate" zero-field splitting.27 In a Q-band EPR study on the manganese-dependant enzyme glutathione transferase, zero-field interaction of moderate size, DR0.1 cmK1, was correlated to pentacoordination28 and this result has been further substantiated through high-frequency studies on manganese model compounds.29 Our preliminary analysis of the spectrum using the energy matrix diagonalisation shows that Dz0.1 cmK1 in Mn-PfPGI and that the differing of the amplitudes of the two manganese spectra by over two orders-of-magnitude (Figure 6(a)) indicates approximately equal concentrations of hexa and pentacoordinated manganese. A multi-frequency EPR study is required for a detailed analysis of these electronic structures; however, analysis of the structure of PfPGI nickel complex (PDB code: 1QXJ)16 reveals that that the bound metal ion in each subunit is hexacoordinated (His88, His90, Glu97, His136 and two water molecules).

Figure 6. The EPR spectra of PfPGI/Mn before (a) and after (b) the addition of the substrate F6P. Prior to the addition of the substrate (a) the low-noise (lower spectra) EPR spectra features a six-line hyperfine structure typical of hexacoordinate Mn(II), with the high-noise spectra (inset, 6.25 times higher amplification) being typical of pentacoordinate Mn(II), showing the presence of both species. After the addition of F6P (b) a four to fivefold reduction is seen in the PfPGI bound hexacoordinate Mn(II) (lower spectra), implying an increase in pentacoordinate Mn(II).

Incubation of the manganese PfPGI with excess F6P leads to the collapsing of the hexacoordinate Mn signal to 20% of its original intensity (Figure 6(b)). A similar reduction in amplitude has been observed in Mn(II) substituted L-ribulose5-phosphate 4-epimerase upon incubation with its substrate.30 Furthermore, the signal from pentacoordinate Mn has changed considerably with the feature between 0.1 T and 0.2 T shifting downfield over 20 mT and the appearance of a strong line near zero field. The latter observation implies that 2Dzhn, i.e. Dz0.16 cmK1, and a change in ligation of the Mn is likely to have occurred. These data are interpreted to indicate that the Mn coordination of the apo enzyme shifts towards pentacoordinate upon binding F6P. Complexes of PfPGI with ring open ligands To investigate the mechanism of PfPGI further, the enzyme was co-crystallised with zinc along with

1359 ° ° chain A (Glu63 O31 2.40 A and O32 2.20 A) and chain ° B (Glu63 O31 1.95 A) of a symmetry-related dimer, generated by a whole cell translation along the a axis. This metal binding site is clearly present solely due to contacts in the crystal lattice and lies ° approximately 25 A from the active site. Initial attempts to prepare a crystal of the PfPGI/ Zn/F6P complex used 5 mM F6P in the crystallisation buffer; however, no electron density was seen for the substrate. The concentration of F6P was subsequently increased to 50 mM during further crystallisation experiments. Although this concentration might seem rather high, the Km for F6P has not been determined in the crystallisation conditions. Examination of the electron density for the active site of the PfPGI/Zn/F6P complex revealed the substrate had bound in a ring open form in both subunits (Figure 7(c)). However, the substrate identity is also ambiguous, as the crystallisation mixture for this complex contained enzyme, metal and F6P. It is, therefore, possible that G6P might have been formed during crystallisation, since

either the most potent inhibitor discovered to date (5PAH), an open chain mimic of the substrate, (S6P) or the substrate (F6P), the structures of which were ° ° ° determined to 2.0 A, 1.95 A and 2.1 A resolution, respectively (Figure 7), each with a dimer of PfPGI in the asymmetric unit. A comparison of these structures revealed that they have high overall similarity to the previously determined apo structure of PfPGI (PDB code: 1X8E),15 with each of the structures having rms Ca deviations to the ° apo complex of 0.50 A over 179 residues (calculated using the program ESCET31). Analysis of the crystal contacts of the PfPGI/Zn/ S6P complex, which crystallises in a different space group (P21) to the other PfPGI complexes presented here, but also with a dimer of PfPGI in the asymmetric unit, reveals an additional metal binding site between symmetry-related PfPGI dimers. This metal ion, which was identified as zinc from its 12s peak in the 2FoKFc map, is ° coordinated by Asp143 (Od1 2.08 A) and Glu144 ° (O32 1.90 A) from chain A and Glu63 from both

Oxygen, phosphorous and nitrogen atoms are shown for all three complexes in red, purple and blue, respectively.

NMR studies of the turnover rate at the temperature at which crystals were grown (290 K) have shown that PfPGI is active at this temperature, albeit in a different buffer to that used in crystallisation. Thus, it is possible that the bound species in the crystal is either G6P, F6P, or a mixture of both the substrates. Currently, the resolution of the data acquired for this complex is insufficient to distinguish between the open chain forms of F6P and G6P. Hence, in the following discussion the complex will be described as the PfPGI/F6P/G6P complex. The ligand-binding site is equivalent in all the complexes (Figure 8) and lies between the two b-sheets of PfPGI and adjacent to the metal-binding site, as previously seen for other substrate mimics, including 5PAA.15,16 The mode of binding of the carbon chains of the three open chain ligands (Figure 8) is similar, although there are differences in the metal coordination of the ligands (Figure 9). The phosphate groups of the ligands in all three complexes form equivalent interactions with Tyr52 OH, Gly87 N, His88 Nd1, Tyr160 OH and a water molecule, which in turn interacts with Thr85 Og1 and the hydroxyls O3 and O5 of F6P/G6P and S6P and their equivalents, O2 and O4, in 5PAH, interact with Thr71 Og1, His158 N 32 and five water molecules (Figure 9). Despite the overall similarity of the ligands (Figure 2), differences are seen in the interactions between the protein and the C1­C2 regions of F6P/G6P and S6P and the equivalent C1­N region of 5PAH. In the complexes with S6P and 5PAH the oxygen atoms O1 and O2 of S6P and O1 and ON1 of 5PAH interact with the bound metal ion in PfPGI (Figure 9). However, unlike S6P, the C1­N region in 5PAH adopts a planar structure due to the restraints provided by double bonds at 5PAH C1­N (Figure 2). The coordination of the metal ion

in each structure is similar with six ligands adopting a distorted octahedral geometry (His88, His90, Glu97, His136, O1 and O2 of S6P or the equivalent O1 and ON1 atoms of 5PAH). However, the interaction between O2 of S6P or equivalent O1 of 5PAH and the metal ion is significantly longer than the other interactions (Table 1). In the PfPGI/F6P/G6P complex the electron density suggests that O1 of the substrate can adopt two different conformations, indicating some flexibility in this region. In one conformation, the positions of the C1 and O1 atoms of F6P/G6P are similar to those seen for C1 and O1 or N and ON1 in the complexes with S6P and 5PAH, respectively, with both O1 and O2 of the F6P/G6P interacting with the metal ion. However, in the second conformation, the C1­C2 bond in F6P/G6P is rotated by approximately 1008, with the O1 of F6P/G6P forming an interaction with His158 N32 ° (2.7 A) rather than with the metal ion (Figure 9(c)). The metal ion is thus pentacoordinated when the F6P/G6P moiety is in this conformation, whereas it is hexacoordinated when F6P/G6P is modelled in the first conformation. This is consistent with the EPR data, presented above. The rotation of the F6P/ G6P C1­C2 bond, in the second conformation, in ° turn causes an approximate w0.6 A displacement of His158 away from the ligand in the F6P/G6P complex compared to the PfPGI 5PAH complexes (Figure 8). Isomerisation reaction The NMR experiments have shown unequivocally that proton exchange occurs with the solvent during the reaction catalysed by PfPGI, precluding direct hydride transfer as the primary mechanism for this enzyme. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that a cis-enediol-based mechanism is utilised by PfPGI. A requirement for such a mechanism is a base to transfer a proton between C1 and C2 of the substrate and there is a stereoselective requirement for the face of the substrate to which the proton is added at C2, as only addition of a proton to the re face of C2 of the intermediate produces G6P (addition to the opposite face would produce M6P). There is, however, no such structural requirement for stereoselective proton addition at C1, although the NMR studies presented here have shown that PfPGI preferentially removes the pro-R proton from C1 of F6P. In the PfPGI/Zn/F6P/G6P complex structure the ° carboxylate oxygen O32 of Glu97 lies 3.16 A and ° from, and perpendicular to, the re face of C1 2.66 A and the re face of C2 of the substrate and similar ° ° distances (2.86 A and 2.94 A, respectively) are seen to the corresponding face of the hydroxamate group of 5PAH in the PfPGI/Zn/5PAH complex, suggesting that Glu97 may act as the catalytic base in PfPGI. In addition, superimposition of the PfPGI/Zn/5PAH structure with the rabbit PGI/ 5PAH structure (PDB code: 1KOJ),14 based on the 5PAH atoms, reveals that Glu97 in PfPGI occurs in

a structurally equivalent position with respect to the 5PAH, to Glu357 in the rabbit PGI/5PAH structure, the residue which has been identified as the putative catalytic base in this enzyme.13 The NMR analysis has also provided evidence that the pro-S hydrogen can be abstracted from F6P, although at a rate vastly reduced compared to the rate of the reaction catalysed by PfPGI. Analysis of the PfPGI/5PAH complex reveals that His158 N32 ° lies 3.30 A from the equivalent face of the hydroxamate to the si face of C1 of G6P, and might therefore be involved in proton abstraction from C1. However, His158 is not in an ideal position to abstract a proton from F6P C1, which may explain the reduced rate of abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen from F6P C1. In addition, His158 lies ° too remote (His158 N32­F6P/G6P C2 4.79 A) from the si face of C2 of F6P to donate a proton to C2, thus

explaining the absence of M6P production by PfPGI.5 Analysis of the complexes presented here has shown that Glu97 is ideally placed to act as a base in the enediol reaction mechanism. However, as the carboxyl group of Glu97 also coordinates the metal ion, it has previously been argued, primarily based on a structure of PfPGI bound to 6-phosphoglutamate, that the electron withdrawing capability of the divalent metal would prevent Glu97 having this role.16 However, in the structure of the complex of PfPGI/Mn/5PAA,15 the O32 carboxyl oxygen of Glu97 and O1A carboxyl oxygen of 5PAA form a ° close contact (2.24 A ) that is indicative of a hydrogen being shared between the two carboxyl groups. Thus, in the environment of the active site of PfPGI, the carboxyl of Glu97 is capable of binding a proton as well as coordinating to the metal ion

and, therefore, has the potential to act as a base. If this is the case, the metal ion is presumably neutralised by a combination of the electrons donated to the coordination shell of the metal by the O1 and O2 hydroxyl or alkoxide atoms of the substrates or the intermediate and the three nitrogen atoms present in the imidazole rings of His88, His90 and His136. Furthermore, the distance between the carboxyl oxygen of Glu97 and the ° metal ion increases from 2.02 A in the apo structure ° of PfPGI11 to 2.26 A in the complex with the substrate, perhaps indicative of a potential dual role for this residue. This is consistent with mutational studies on the equivalent glutamate residue (Glu93) in the related PGI from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The apparent Kcat was reduced 2000fold when this glutamate was mutated to an aspartate and to a non-detectible level when mutated to an alanine.32 Complex of PfPGI with a ring closed mimic In solution at room temperature, F6P and G6P exist predominantly in a ring closed form,33 therefore, prior to isomerisation, the substrates require ring opening. In eukaryotic PGI this process is thought to be enzyme-catalysed by a histidine and a bound water molecule13 which lie adjacent to O5 of the substrate. Previous structural investigations of PfPGI failed to identify a residue that could be responsible for enzymatic ring opening of the substrate15,16 and have led to the suggestion that there may be a higher proportion of ring open substrate available at the normal operating temperature of the pyrococcal enzyme (100 8C).16 To investigate this further, a structure of PfPGI complexed with a mimic of the substrate, M6P, ° was determined to 2.1 A resolution, with the overall

structure showing high similarity to the apo ° enzyme of PfPGI (rmsd of 0.5 A). The active site of the PfPGI/M6P complex shows clear electron density for a ring closed pyranose form of M6P (Figure 10). Analysis of the contacts between the bound M6P and the enzyme (Table 1) reveals that the M6P moiety binds in a similar position to the open chain ligands in the complexes presented above with the phosphate group adopting a near identical position. Unlike the open chain ligands, however, the bound M6P makes no direct interaction with the metal ion in the enzyme, which is present in a pentacoordinate state (coordinated by His88, His90, Glu97, His136 and one water molecule). The binding of the pyranose ring form of M6P, which is similar to that of the substrate G6P, in the active site of PfPGI suggests that the enzyme may indeed catalyse ring opening during catalysis as the active site of PfPGI is large enough to accommodate a ring closed form of the substrate. However, analysis of the interactions between the O5 of M6P (the oxygen attacked during ring opening) and the enzyme reveals that the only residue close to this ° oxygen is Thr71 (Og1­M6P O5 3.33 A). As threonine is unlikely to catalyse ring opening, it appears that this structure does not suggest a candidate for the ring opening catalyst in PfPGI. This structure does show that PfPGI is capable of binding a ring closed sugar and as the substrate G6P and the sugar M6P are enantiomers, differing in the stereogenic configuration at C2, if a ring closed form of G6P were to bind to PfPGI, it may well be in a different manner to that seen for M6P. Further experiments are required to resolve this issue.

Conclusions
The study here has provided direct evidence that hydrogen exchange occurs between the solvent and the substrate during the reaction catalysed by PfPGI, precluding a direct hydride shift-based mechanism for the enzyme. In addition, the structural and biochemical investigations of PfPGI with the substrate, F6P, and several competitive inhibitors have allowed the identification of a putative catalytic base (Glu97) and led to the suggestion that a cis-enediol-based mechanism, similar to that suggested for the structurally unrelated eukaryotic PGIs, occurs in PfPGI (Figure 11). This raises the intriguing possibility that Nature has evolved the same reaction mechanism for this aldose ketose isomerisation based on two completely different structural scaffolds.

The gene encoding PfPGI was cloned, overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described.34 Samples of PfPGI were concentrated to 12 mg/ml and crystallised using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 290 K. Drops (4 ml) were composed of 50% protein solution containing 5 mM ZnCl2 and either 5 mM 5PAH (PfPGI/Zn/5PAH complex), 50 mM D-fructose 6-phosphate (PfPGI/Zn/ F6P/G6P complex), 5 mM D -sorbitol 6-phosphate (PfPGI/Zn/S6P complex) or 5 mM D-mannose 6-phosphate (PfPGI/Zn/M6P complex) and 50% reservoir solution. Crystals of the complexes were grown using the following reservoir solutions: 0.1 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M sodium acetate trihydrate (pH 4.6), 20% (w/v) PEG monoethyl ether 2000 (PfPGI/Zn/F6P complex); 15% PEG 4000, 10% (v/v) isopropanol, 0.15 M Hepes (pH 7.5) (PfPGI/Zn/S6P complex); 0.05 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 20% PEG monoethyl ether 2000 (PfPGI/Zn/M6P complex); and 0.1 M trisodium citrate (pH 6.5), 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 10% isopropanol (PfPGI/Zn/ 5PAH complex). For data collection, crystals were stabilised for 30 s in a solution of mother liquor containing either 10% or 20% glycerol for the complexes with S6P and F6P, M6P and 5PAH, respectively, prior to being flash cooled at 100 K. Data were collected on a MAR345 image plate detector using Osmic Varimax confocal mirror

focused Cu Ka X-rays, produced by a Rigaku MM007 rotating-anode generator using a rotation range of 0.58 per image (Table 2). Data were processed using MOSFLM35 and were subsequently analysed using the CCP4 suite.36 Despite the use of PEG as a precipitant, as an alternative to the 1.6 M trisodium citrate used in the apo form of PfPGI,15 the crystals of the PfPGI complexes with Zn and either 5PAH, F6P or M6P were isomorphous to the apo form. To calculate initial phases for these three structures a model of the dimer of PfGPI (PDB code: 1X8E)15 was placed in the unit cell of each using MOLREP.37 Following map improvement using ARP/ wARP38 the subsequent electron density revealed the location of the Zn2C and the ligands 5PAH, F6P and M6P in the respective complexes (Figure 7), which were then incorporated into the model. Refinement of each model was completed using REFMAC539 and manual rebuilding in Coot.40 The final model was checked for bias by removal of the ligands and re-refining the structures, following which clear density returned for the ligands and metal ions in the resulting FoKFc map. The PfPGI/Zn/S6P complex crystallised in a primitive ° monoclinic lattice with cell dimensions aZ42.3 A, bZ ° ° 72.9 A, cZ71.6 A and bZ103.68. Solvent content analysis suggested that two polypeptide chains of PfPGI were present within the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement using the coordinates of the dimer of the apo enzyme of PfPGI (PDB code: 1X8E) as a search model was conducted using PHASER.41 A solution for the translation function was only found in space group P21, confirming this to be the correct space group. Refinement and rebuilding was completed as above, with Zn2C and S6P placed in the appropriate density. In addition, dual conformations were noted for the side-chains of Asp29, Glu37, Ser121, Asp159 and His158 in chain A of the PfPGI/S6P complex and have been modelled with each conformation having half occupancy. In the final models of these four PfPGI complexes all the residues are well defined except for residues 188 and 189, which are absent from the electron density in both chains in all complexes. The quality of the models was

assessed with Procheck,42 which revealed that there are no non-glycine Ramachandran outliers with 94.3%, 92.7%, 93.4 and 94.6% of the residues in favoured conformations for the structures of the 5PAH, F6P/G6P, S6P and M6P containing complexes, respectively. Refinement statistics are given in Table 2. Figures were generated using PyMOL,43 MDL ISIS/DRAW (Elsevier MDL) and SIGMAPLOT (Systat software). Kinetic measurements The activity of PfPGI in the direction F6P to G6P was measured using a coupled assay with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Unitika LTD). G6PDH converts G6P to gluconate 6-phosphate, with concurrent reduction of NADP C to NADPH, resulting in an increase of absorbance at 340 nm (3Z6.22!10K3 MK1 cmK1), which was measured on a Pelkin Elmer Lambda 12 dual-beam spectrophotometer with a 1 cm path length at 50 8C. Assays were carried out in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7) with the addition of varying concentrations of F6P plus saturating NADPC(1 mM), excess G6PDH and either EDTA, 5PAA or 5PAH as appropriate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 ml PfPGI (6 mM stock) and four independent observations with two preparations of PfPGI were measured. NMR spectroscopy
1 H 1D and 1H-natural abundance 13C HSQC experiments were performed on a Bruker 800 MHz spectrometer at 298 K using samples containing 10 mM G6P in 93% 2H2O/7% H2O and 10 mM F6P in 93% 2H2O/7% H2O to assign the fully protonated substrates. Following the addition of 50 ml of 13 mg/ml recombinant PfPGI, expressed in E. coli, in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7), to 450 ml of 10 mM G6P in 93% 2H2O/7% H2O, the sample was incubated at 60 8C for 2 h, and the 1H 1D and 1Hnatural abundance 13C HSQC experiments were repeated.

Control spectra were obtained from a sample prepared and incubated in the same way but without enzyme, to take account of any natural incorporation of 2H2O into the sugars. The experiments were repeated on an F6P sample in the same way. 1H and 13C resonances for G6P and F6P were assigned by comparison with literature values.44,45 To assist in the assignment of the products of the above reactions, similar spectra were accumulated on a sample of 23 mg/ml phosphomannose isomerase in 10 mM M6P in 2H2O. In addition, 1H 1D spectra were run after addition of 0.13 mg/ml of PfPGI to both F6P and G6P to observe the growth of the anomeric protons of G6P and the H1 resonance of F6P, respectively. EPR spectroscopy Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were taken on a 5 mg/ml PfPGI sample in 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), to which 0.2 mM of MnCl2 was added anaerobically. Spectra were also obtained from the PfPGI ternary complexes produced by the addition of 10 mM of either G6P or F6P to the above preparation. All samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to obtaining X band EPR spectra on a Bruker ER 200 D spectrometer, using a microwave frequency of 9.64 GHz, a microwave power of 0.126 mW or 126 mW, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, a modulation amplitude of 0.63 mT and a temperature of 13 K.
