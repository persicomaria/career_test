SUMMARY Some immunological studies on prothrombin fragment 1 from bovine prothrombin and its warfarin-induced precursor acarboxyprothrombin are reported. Based on the results, a rapid and simple immunoadsorption method for the isolation of prothrombin fragment 1 in good yield has been established. The method exploits the conformational change induced in the fragment by removal of Ca 2+ . The principle may be applicable to other 7-carboxyglutamyl-containing proteins or fragments thereof.

INTRODUCTION As a result of a vitamin K-dependent reaction the coagulation factors II, IX, X and probably also VII contain 7-carboxyglutamyl residues [1-7]. Recently, other proteins of unknown function with the same type of modified glutamyl residues have been described [8, 9]. In factor II (prothrombin) the 7-carboxyglutamic acid residues are located in the activation fragment (prothrombin fragment 1) which in bovine prothrombin comprises the amino acids 1-156 from the N-terminal end [10] and which is released from prothrombin by different enzymes [11-18]. For a kinetic study of the vitamin K-dependent reaction a rapid isolation method for prothrombin fragment 1 is desirable. We report here some immunological studies on prothrombin fragment 1 from bovine prothrombin and its precursor acarboxyprothrombin and also a rapid and efficient purification method for prothrombin fragment 1 based on this study. The principle of this method may be applicable also to other 7-carboxyglutamylcontaining proteins or fragments thereof. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bovine prothrombin was purified [19] and prothrombin antiserum was raised in a goat [20] as described. The immunoglobin fraction was isolated by ammonium Abbreviation: SDS, sodium dodecyl sulphate.

318 sulphate precipitation and further purified by affinity chromatography on a Sepharoseprothrombin column [20]. Finally, it was coupled to Sepharose 4B as described [20]. Acarboxyprothrombin was purified as described [19] from bovine blood 5 days after the start of warfarin treatment. The affinity columns were equilibrated against 0.05 M Tris. HCI (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 M NaC1. Prothrombin was digested with TosPheCHzCl-trypsin (Worthington) for 5 h at 37°C in 0.2 M NH4HCO3 pH 8.5 at an enzyme to protein ratio 1:50. The digest was lyophilized, dissolved in 0.01 M sodium oxalate and treated with BaSO4 (100 mg/ml). To remove the salt, the eluate in 0.15 M sodium citrate was submitted to filtration through Sephadex G-25 (2 × 31 cm) in 0.5 ~ NH4OH. The void volume fraction was further filtered through a column of Sephadex G-50 (1.7 × 85 cm) in 0.5 ~ NH4OH. In the eluate a peak containing one peptide was found. The material was submitted to amino acid analyses using a Jeol JLC-6A instrument according to Spackman et al. [21] and sequential Edman-degradation as described by Sletten and co-workers [22, 23]. Immobilized trypsin and thrombin were prepared by coupling the enzymes to Sepharose 4B as described by March et al. [24]. Trypsin (15 mg, Worthington, TosPheCH2Cl-treated) and thrombin (Topostasine, Roche, 6000 N.I.H. units) were each dissolved in 50 ml coupling buffer and added to separate batches of 25 ml CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. The gels were treated with 1 M ethanolamine and then washed as recommended. For each immobilized enzyme a 50 ml slurry in 0.05 M Tris. HC1 (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 M NaC1 was prepared. Analytical polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis was performed at pH 9.4 as described by Davis [25] and at pH 5.8 as described by Orr et al. [26]. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out by the method of Laemmli [27]. Preparative polyacrylamide disc gel (Buchler Instruments, Fort Lee, N.J., U.S.A.) was carried out as described by the manufacturers. For molecular weight determination ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin and the heavy and light chains of F-globulin were used as standards, lmmunodiffusion was performed as described by Ouchterlony [28] using either 10 mM CaClz or 10 mM EDTA in the gel buffer. Barium sulphate and barium citrate adsorptions was carried out according to Hjort [29] and Stenn and Blout [30], respectively. Protein was determined by the Lowry method [31]. N-terminal amino acid analysis by the dansyl method [32] was carried out as modified by Flengsrud [33]. Thrombin activity was assayed in a mixture of 0.2 ml bovine fibrinogen (2.9 mg/ml), 0.1 ml veronal-buffered saline [29] and 0.1 ml thrombin solution. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Activation of prothrombin with immobilized enzymes Purified prothrombin was dissolved (0.48 mg/ml) in 0.05 M Tris. HCI (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 M NaC1. For the splitting by trypsin 0.1 ml of the slurry of immobilized enzyme was added per ml of prothrombin and 0.3 ml per ml of the Sepharosethrombin was used. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking and the reaction stopped by cooling in ice-water and removal of the Sepharose-enzyme by centrifugation (4500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Maximum thrombin activity in the incubation with Sepharose-trypsin was obtained after 5 min.

Isolation of prothrombin fragment 1
Prothrombin (2.4 mg in 6 ml) was treated with 1.8 ml of Sepharose-thrombin or 0.6 ml Sepharose-trypsin. The trypsin incubations were stopped as above after 5 min and the thrombin incubations after 60 min. Thrombin splits prothrombin at the Arg 156-Set 157 bond to give prothrombin fragment 1 and prethrombin 1 [10]. Accordingly, no thrombin activity was found in the supernatant of the activation system. Trypsin, on the other hand, is a powerful activator of prothrombin and the activation pathway is the same as for factor Xa [11]. Thus, prothrombin fragment 1 was present in both activation mixtures. Being interested in the kinetics of the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of prothrombin we looked for a rapid and simple method for the isolation of prothrombin fragment 1 in good yield from such incubation mixtures. Adsorption to BaSO4 seemed the logical choice, since the adsorption depends on the 7-carboxyglutamyl residues present in prothrombin fragment 1, whereas the other fragments and intermediates are without such groups. Preliminary experiments showed that although Sepharose-thrombin-activated prothrombin was completely split into prothrombin fragment 1 and prethrombin 1 more than 6 0 ~ of prethrombin 1 was adsorbed to BaSO4 and eluted with 0.15 M sodium citrate. Prothrombin fragment 1 and prethrombin 1 were separable only by gel filtration or electrophoresis in the presence of EDTA. Using barium citrate the yield of prothrombin fragment 1 was low (10~ or less) and the eluate contained prethrombin 1. Thus, none of these methods were well suited for our purpose. When the supernatant from the activation mixture was submitted to immunoadsorbent chromatography in the presence of 10 mM EDTA, a protein peak (peak X) eluted with the equilibration buffer (containing 10 mM EDTA) (Fig. 1 A), whereas the bulk of protein (peak Y) was recovered only after elution with 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0), containing 0.5 M NaC1 and 4 M urea. When Ca 2÷ was added to the supernatant, no protein peak was eluted when the equilibration buffer was used, but a protein peak (peak X) appeared during subsequent elution with 10 mM EDTA in the same buffer (Fig. 1 B). The bulk of protein (peak Y) was eluted as before. A similar pattern was observed both after incubation with Sepharose-trypsin and with Sepharose-thrombin. In all experiments the peaks (X) eluted in EDTA were homogeneous in polyacrylamide disc gel and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had identical mobility in any given system. Their molecular weight in the SDSsystem was about 24 000. The N-terminal amino acid was alanine both in peak X eluted as in Fig. 1 A and B. We conclude that the two peaks are homogeneous and identical to prothrombin fragment 1. The yield of the EDTA-eluted peak was above 90 ~ in all cases. To test the method on a crude mixture of proteins containing prothrombin we used a barium citrate eluate of bovine plasma dialyzed against 50 m M Tris. HC1, 0.1 M NaC1 (pH 7.4). After incubation for 50 min at 37 °C with soluble thrombin (final concentration 1 N.I.H./ml), 10 mM CaCI2 was added and the mixture chromatographed on the immunoadsorbent column which had previously been equilibrated with the same Tris buffer containing 10 mM CaCI 2. A protein peak (fraction I) was eluted with the equilibration buffer. The eluant was then changed to contain 10 mM EDTA instead of CaC12 and a second, smaller protein peak (fraction II) was eluted. The remaining of the antigenic material bound to the column was eluted with 0.1 M

The barium citrate eluate (A), the mixture after thrombin treatment (B) and Fractions I (C) and II (D) from the immunoadsorbent column were all submitted to analytical polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A-D). These gels show that the isolation of electrophoretically homogenous prothrombin fragment 1 (fraction II, Fig. 2 D) from a rather heterogeneous mixture is possible in only one step. Hence, the purification of prothrombin fragment 1 can conveniently be carried out in the following way. The protein solution is submitted to immunoadsorbent chromatography using antiprothrombin-Sepharose. If the prothrombin used is contaminated or activating enzymes not removed, CaCIz should be added to the mixture before application to the column. Proteins not derived from prothrombin will be washed off the column with the application buffer. Elution ofprothrombin fragment 1 can then be performed with 10 mM EDTA in the same buffer. Any unsplit prothrombin and all fragments and intermediates except prothrombin fragment 1 are retained and can be eluted with urea/ NaCl/acetate buffer as described. lmmunodiffusion of prothrombin fragment 1 against antiprothrombin in the presence of Ca z÷ or EDTA (Fig. 3) is in accord with the results of the immunoadsorption. No precipitation line was seen in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 3 A) whereas one line was seen with CaCI2 present. A similar effect has been observed earlier by Stenflo [34] and reflects the conformational changes in the fragment induced by Ca 2+ [35]. At neutral pH, in the absence of Ca 2÷, the ~-carboxyglutamyl side chains will be ionized and lead to a considerable electrostatic repulsion resulting in a conformational change [36]. Ca 2+ neutralizes these repulsive forces by binding to the carboxyl groups.

Wells 1 and 3 contain prothrombin, well 2 contains prothrombin fragment 1, well 4 contains antiprothrombinantiserum. To see whether this conformational change influenced the binding of intact prothrombin to the antibodies, we submitted purified prothrombin (168 units/ml) to immunoadsorbent chromatography in the presence of either 10 mM EDTA or 10 mM CaCI2 on an antiprothrombin-Sepharose column (1.4 × 4.5 cm) in 0.05 M Tris.HCl (pH 7.4) with 0.1 M NaC1 at 4 °C. In the presence of Ca 2÷ the total binding capacity

322 of the immunoadsorbent was 1210 units of prothrombin. In the presence of EDTA only 670 units were bound, i.e. the same immunoadsorbent bound 44 ~o less of intact prothrombin in the presence of EDTA. This may be due to a conformational change of a larger part of the molecule, altering more than one antigenic structure when Ca 2+ is removed, or the CaZ+-dependant antigenic structure may be a predominant antigen on the prothrombin molecule. To see whether the antigenic structure was simply based on the y-carboxyglutamyl residues themselves, the tryptic peptide Gly 12-Lys 44 from prothrombin fragment 1 was prepared. This peptide contains 8 of the 10 known y-carboxyglutamic acid residues in prothrombin [10]. The peptide was submitted to immunodiffusion and immunoadsorbent chromatography. No precipitation was obtained and the peptide did not bind to antiprothrombin-Sepharose either in the presence or absence of Ca z+. This peptide is therefore without any complete antigenic determinants in relation to the antiserum used.

Comparison betweenfragment 1 from normal and acarboxyprothrombin
Acarboxyprothrombin was activated with Sepharose-thrombin and fragment 1 isolated by preparative polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Acarboxyprothrombin fragment I* bound strongly to the immunoadsorbent both in the presence of Ca 2+ and in the presence of EDTA. Elution was performed with urea/acetate buffer as described. Thus, this fragment 1 was more tightly bound than its normal counterpart. A parallel phenomenon was observed when acarboxy- and normal prothrombin were purified by immunoadsorption [19, 20]. Acarboxyprothrombin fragment 1 must therefore have at least one antigenic determinant which is present also on prothrombin, whereas it probably lacks all or most of the y-carboxyglutamyl residues. This fragment 1 on the other hand, gave no precipitation line with the anti-prothrombin serum in immunodifusion (Fig. 4 A). It did, however, strongly inhibit the reaction of normal prothrombin fragment 1 with antiprothrombin antibodies (Fig. 4 A, B, C). These results are best explained if acarboxyprothrombin fragment 1 shares only one antigenic determinant with the intact prothrombin molecule. This permits binding to the immunoadsorbent but not precipitation. Prothrombin fragment 1 probably shares two determinants with prothrombin. This permits both binding to the immunoadsorbent and precipitation. The removal of Ca 2+ must in some way also disturb the expression of the second determinant, since EDTA-elution gives a very good yield of prothrombin fragment 1 from the immunoadsorbent. One determinant is connected with the secondary structure induced by Cae+-binding to the },-carboxyglutamyl residues. The other determinant must be identical to that on acarboxyprothrombin fragment 1 since the latter fragment inhibits the precipitation reaction between prothrombin fragment 1 and antiprothrombin (Fig. 4 A, B, C). An alternative explanation of our observation might be a conformational change in antibodies against at least two different antigenic structures when Ca 2+ is substituted with EDTA, rendering their antigen binding sites inactive. This seems rather unlikely. * Prothrombin fragment 1 is the activation fragment comprising amino acid residues I-156 from the N-terminal end of bovine factor II ; acarboxyprothrombin is the precursor which is converted to factor lI in a vitamin K-dependent reaction and which contains less than 10 7-carboxyglutamyl residues; acarboxyprothrombin fragment I is correspondingly its N-terminal activation fragment.
