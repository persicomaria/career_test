Abstract Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25-kDa lipocalin originally purified from human neutrophils. It exists in monomeric and homo- and heterodimeric forms, the latter as a dimer with human neutrophil gelatinase. It is secreted from specific granules of activated human neutrophils. Homologous proteins have been identified in mouse (24p3/ uterocalin) and rat (K2 -microglobulin-related protein/neu-related lipocalin). Structural data have confirmed a typical lipocalin fold of NGAL with an eight-stranded L-barrel, but with an unusually large cavity lined with more polar and positively charged amino acid residues than normally seen in lipocalins. Chemotactic formyl-peptides from bacteria have been proposed as ligands of NGAL, but binding experiments and the structure of NGAL do not support this hypothesis. Besides neutrophils, NGAL is expressed in most tissues normally exposed to microorganisms, and its synthesis is induced in epithelial cells during inflammation. This may indicate either a microbicidal activity of NGAL or a role in regulation of inflammation or cellular growth, putative functions yet to be demonstrated. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Lipocalins are a diverse family of proteins with a limited amino acid sequence similarity, but with a common tertiary structure with an eight-stranded anti-parallel L-barrel surrounding a cup-shaped li-

gand-binding interior or calyx, lined with hydrophobic amino acid residues. This confers lipocalins the ability to bind and transport a wide variety of small lipophilic substances and to serve diverse biological functions in retinol transport, taste and olfaction, pheromone binding, cryptic coloration and prostaglandin synthesis, for review see Flower [1]. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was originally identi¢ed as a 25-kDa protein covalently associated with 92-kDa gelatinase/MMP9 from human neutrophils [2,3]. Immunization of rabbits with neutrophil gelatinase puri¢ed on gelatin^Sepharose gave rise to antibodies reacting not only with 92-kDa gelatinase, but also with a 25-kDa protein. This observation

could be explained by the existence of a 135-kDa covalent complex between the 25-kDa protein and neutrophil gelatinase, resulting in copuri¢cation of the two proteins on gelatin^Sepharose. The 25-kDa protein could be puri¢ed in its monomeric and dimeric forms from exocytozed material from human neutrophils [2]. At about the same time, the protein was isolated by Triebel et al. from reduced, puri¢ed neutrophil gelatinase. The 25 kDa protein was dissociated from gelatinase allowing its subsequent separation from gelatinase by gel ¢ltration [3]. Amino acid sequence analysis of the isolated protein revealed a very high degree of similarity to the deduced amino acid sequences of the mouse gene 24p3 and the cDNA of rat K2 -microglobulin-related protein [2,3], both shown to be members of the lipocalin family by Flower et al. [4]. For these reasons, the 25-kDa protein was designated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin or NGAL. The protein has later been puri¢ed by Xu and coworkers, who suggested the name human neutrophil lipocalin or HNL [5]. Originally, the cDNA of rat K2 -microglobulin-related protein was fortuitously isolated during screening of a cDNA library for other purposes [6]. By a di¡erential hybridization technique, an identical cDNA was later found to be highly overexpressed in mammary cancers (compared to normal mammary tissue) induced by the oncogene neu (HER2/c-erbB2), which is a potent inducer of mammary cancers in rats. The gene was therefore designated neu-related lipocalin [7]. The transcript of the mouse gene, 24p3, was identi¢ed as mRNA that was induced by infection of cultured mouse kidney cells by SV40 or polyoma virus [8]. The gene product was later shown to be identical to a 24-kDa, superinducible protein, SIP24, isolated from Balb/c 3T3 mouse ¢broblasts stimulated with growth factors in the presence of cycloheximide [9^11]. The mouse protein has later been renamed uterocalin, due to its high expression in uterine luminal £uid and epithelium, especially around parturition [12,13]. 2. Primary, secondary, and tertiary structure The complete amino acid sequence of puri¢ed, native NGAL was determined by sequence analysis of

isolated peptides obtained after cleavage of the reduced, carboxymethylated protein with three di¡erent proteases and CNBr [2]. It is a 178 amino acid protein, with pyroglutamate at the amino-terminus, like in the murine 24p3 [2,14] (Fig. 1). The calculated molecular mass of the protein backbone is 20 542 Da, in agreement with the observed molecular mass of the deglycosylated protein of 21 kDa, and in keeping with the size range of lipocalins. Asparagine, positioned at residue 65 in the mature protein, was shown to be glycosylated in accordance with the presence of a consensus sequence for N-glycosylation (Asn-x-Ser/Thr, in this case Asn-Val-Thr), [2], (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequence deduced from NGAL cDNA (isolated from human bone marrow and chronic myeloid leukemia cDNA libraries) showed complete identity with the determined amino acid sequence. In addition, a 20 amino acid signal peptide rich in hydrophobic residues was identi¢ed, as for other proteins destined for the secretory pathway [15,16]. Fig. 1 also shows the alignment of NGAL with 24p3 and K2 -microglobulin-related protein and with lipocalin members showing a high degree of similarity to NGAL. NGAL and K2 -microglobulin-related protein are 63.5% identical on the amino acid level with an additional 27% amino acid substitutions caused by single base mutations. Likewise, NGAL and 24p3 are 62% identical. This degree of homology is comparable to interspecies similarities of other lipocalins identi¢ed in rodents and humans, including K1 acid glycoprotein (51% identity), von Ebner's gland protein (60%), apolipoprotein D (73%), K1 -microglobulin (76%), prostaglandin D synthase (81%) and retinol binding protein (84%). This indicates that 24p3 and K2 -microglobulin-related protein are in fact mouse and rat homologues to NGAL. This is further validated by a high degree of identity at the cDNA level [15^17]. A two amino acid deletion is observed in the rat and human sequences compared to 24p3, which also displays an N-glycosylation site at Asn-81 not present in K2 -microglobulin-related protein and NGAL. On the other hand, the N-glycosylation site at Asn-65 in NGAL is present in both rodent proteins. The two cysteines (at positions 76 and 176 in mature NGAL) are conserved in all known lipocalins, where they form an intra-molecular disul¢de bridge [1]. As opposed to the rodent proteins,

The N-glycosylation site (residue 65 in NGAL) is marked by a square. The motifs de¢ned by Flower et al. [4], are shown in shaded boxes. The identi¢ed secondary structural elements of NGAL (310 -helix, L-strands 1^9, and K-helix) are shown above the NGAL sequence (from [19]).

NGAL has an additional cysteine located at position 87. This is responsible for homodimerization and for heterodimerization with gelatinase. These covalent complexes therefore cannot be made by the mouse and rat proteins. Covalent heterodimerization is a characteristic trait of several lipocalins including C8Q (with C8K), K1 -microglobulin (with IgA), and apolipoprotein D (with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase) [1]. Likewise, homodimerization has been demonstrated for L-lactoglobulin, K2 -microglobulin, and odorant-binding protein (all non-covalently associated) and for apolipoprotein D, which is present in a covalent complex in urine [18]. Several lipocalin members are identi¢ed when searching for proteins homologous to NGAL. Whereas prostaglandin D synthase and K1 -microglobulin share 33 and 25% identical amino acids with NGAL, respectively, most other lipocalins, including

retinol binding protein and bovine L-lactoglobulin, display an identity to NGAL of less than 20% (Fig. 1). This limited degree of amino acid conservation between individual lipocalin members is a typical feature, but it is known, that the shared amino acids cluster within three short, highly conserved sequence motifs (shaded in Fig. 1). These motifs are of prime importance for the lipocalin fold, the common tertiary structure of lipocalins [1]. This is dominated by an anti-parallel 8-stranded L-barrel with an internal cup shaped hydrophobic cavity, where a lipophilic ligand is bound [1]. The solution structure of recombinant human NGAL, as determined by NMR spectroscopy, was recently published [19]. This con¢rms that NGAL has a typical lipocalin fold and contains the nine Lstrands, one K-helix, and a short 310 -helix present in all previously published lipocalin structures (Fig. 1).

Most of the NGAL L-strands are connected with characteristic short hairpin loops except for the 6loop between strands 1 and 2 as in other lipocalins. The L-strands form an anti-parallel L-barrel, with the two sheets made up of strands L2-L4 and L6-L8, with either edge of the barrel lined by the L5 and L1 strands, respectively. The unpaired cysteine (residue 87) responsible for homodimerization or complexation with gelatinase lies in the L4-L5-loop at the closed end of the barrel with its SH group projecting outwards thus being accessible for binding. The closed end of the barrel is formed by the 310 -helix and a tightly packed cluster involving the highly conserved residues W31, T113, and R140 (Fig. 1). Lipocalins are known to transport small lipophilic substances within the barrel cavity. The ligand binding site of the barrel in NGAL is lined with hydrophobic aliphatic and aromatic residues towards the base, with more polar residues towards the open end. At the open end, positively charged residues project into the barrel. This is an unusual feature for lipocalins [19]. The position of the C-terminal K-helix in relation to the L-barrel could not be determined with certainty by NMR, proposedly due to a £exible hinge connecting the K-helix to L8 [19]. Recently, crystals of recombinant human NGAL were obtained [20], and structural data found to be somewhat in disagreement with the solution structure (Goetz et al., manuscript submitted), albeit the overall lipocalin fold structure of NGAL was con¢rmed. First, the crystal structure implies less £exibility of NGAL, compared to the solution structure. Furthermore, the crystallographic analysis revealed the binding pocket of NGAL to be unusually large and open compared to other lipocalins, and to be lined by a remarkably high number of polar and positive amino acid residues (Goetz et al., manuscript submitted). An additional potential binding groove between the K-helix and the outer aspect of L-strands 6 and 7 was identi¢ed by X-ray crystallography, a structure also identi¢ed in L-lactoglobulin [21]. 3. cDNA and gene structure Northern blotting identi¢ed a transcript for NGAL of approximately 850 bp in human bone marrow [15]. Molecular cloning of PCR ampli¢ed

NGAL fragments from a chronic myelogenous leukemia cDNA library revealed a cDNA with a 63-bp 5P-untranslated region, a 591-bp open reading frame, and a 3P-untranslated region which could not be ampli¢ed, but later shown to be 142 bp by genomic cloning [15,17]. This is in accordance with the sizes of rat and mouse mRNAs, which are 900 and 1000 bp, respectively, and with 3P-untranslated regions of approximately 220 bp [6,8,10]. The NGAL gene has been cloned and sequenced, including a 3696-bp coding region encompassing seven exons and six introns [17]. The genomic structure of NGAL is highly homologous to those of other lipocalin members, although it di¡ers from that of 24p3, which only has six exons [22]. The sizes of exons 2^5 are very similar in NGAL and 24p3, whereas the last exon of 24p3 is larger than the combined exons 6 and 7 in NGAL. The positions of intron/exon junctions are highly conserved in exons 1^6 [17]. The LCN2 gene encoding NGAL has been assigned to chromosome 9 on the HSA9q34 area [23], where most known human lipocalin genes are clustered. Likewise, most mouse lipocalins, including the Lcn2 gene encoding 24p3, have been assigned to the proximal area of mouse chromosome 2. Interestingly, the NGAL/24p3 genes are in close proximity to the prostaglandin D synthase genes in keeping with the relatively high degree of similarity of these lipocalin members and with their location on a separate cluster on a phylogenetic tree of 85 lipocalins [24]. This implies a close evolutionary relationship of NGAL and prostaglandin D synthase, the only lipocalin identi¢ed thus far with enzymatic activity [1]. 4. The ligand of NGAL Lipocalins are characterized by their ability to bind di¡erent lipophilic substances, encompassing retinoids, fatty acids, cholesterols, prostaglandins, biliverdins, pheromones, tastants, and odorants [1]. Some lipocalins bind several ligands (e.g. L-lactoglobulin), whereas others are speci¢c for a single substance. In many cases, the true ligand, bound in vivo, has not been determined. Several potential NGAL ligands have been proposed. During investigation of the receptor for bacterial, chemotactic, formylpeptides in human neutro-

phils (the fMLP-receptor, fMLP is a common nonstandard abbreviation for N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe), Allen et al. [25] identi¢ed a 24-kDa protein, which bound a photoactivatable, radioactive derivative of the formylpeptide, fMLPL-SASD. SengelÖv and coworkers later con¢rmed this binding, and the protein responsible was shown to be identical to NGAL [26]. The binding could be completely blocked by incubation with an excess of unlabeled fMLPL-SASD and partly with the underivatized SASD group. In line with this, fMLPL alone was unable to completely block the labeling, indicating an e¡ect of the SASD group on the binding. In keeping with this observation, the association constant (Ka ) was higher for the fMLPL^SASD complex than for fMLPL alone (6.9U106 M31 vs. 2U104 M31 ) [25]. By £uorescence quenching and gel ¢ltration/binding experiments, Chu et al. demonstrated a binding of fMLP to 24p3 with an estimated Ka of 4.8U105 M31 and found association constants of the same order of magnitude for 24p3 binding to cholesteryl oleate, retinoic acid, and retinol [14]. We were unable to show any a¤nity of these compounds for NGAL using the same approaches as Chu, and an a¤nity of fMLP for NGAL was only revealed by weak a¤nity chromatography, but with a considerably lower Ka of 0.7U103 M31 [27]. A similar low a¤nity of NGAL was found for platelet-activating factor and leukotriene B4, which are other neutrophil chemotactic factors previously proposed as potential NGAL ligands. The discrepancy between the a¤nity of NGAL for fMLP in mice and humans may of course be explained by variation between species, but may also be due to methodological di¡erences. The lack of correction for £uorescence quenching caused by the presence of free tryptophanamide, may have led to an overestimation of the association constants determined for 24p3 [27]. The published association constants for the proposed NGAL ligands are orders of magnitude lower than those reported for the interaction between other lipocalins and retinol, which are between 4.7 and 40U106 M31 [28]. This may well indicate, that the true lipophilic ligand(s) of NGAL yet remains to be determined. X-ray crystallographic data support this notion, since the ligand binding pocket is unusually large and does not very well ¢t fMLP as a ligand (Goetz et al., manuscript submitted).

5. Tissue-speci¢c expression in health and disease NGAL was originally isolated from human neutrophils in a monomeric and a homodimeric form, and in addition as an NGAL^gelatinase complex [2,3]. Subcellular fractionation experiments on density gradients clearly demonstrated NGAL to be a component of speci¢c granules in human neutrophils (Fig. 2) [5,25,29,30]. This was con¢rmed by doublelabeling, immunogold electron microscopy, where NGAL colocalized with lactoferrin, a well-established speci¢c granule protein (Fig. 2) [30]. Peroxidase negative granules in human neutrophils comprise a continuum from granules rich in NGAL, but hardly containing gelatinase, over granules containing both NGAL and gelatinase (in a covalent complex) to granules rich in gelatinase, but devoid of NGAL [29,30] (Fig. 2). NGAL and gelatinase are thus in part physically separated, which may explain the existence of unassociated forms of both proteins in human neutrophils [30]. The localization of NGAL in speci¢c granules indicates a highly regulated exocytosis of this protein, which occurs only when the adherent neutrophils are activated in the in£ammatory/infectious focus by an array of in£ammatory mediators including formyl peptides, LTB4 , PAF, IL-8, C5a, and GM-CSF [30]. NGAL di¡ers in this respect from most other lipocalins, which are constitutively secreted to plasma and other body £uids [1]. Expression of NGAL protein can only be demonstrated in neutrophils as opposed to other blood leukocytes (Kjeldsen, unpublished observation) [31]. No NGAL mRNA is present in mature blood neutrophils, in accordance with the observation that NGAL is synthesized in myelocytes and metamyelocytes in the bone marrow, where NGAL is packaged into speci¢c granules [32,33]. Even in tissue-in¢ltrating neutrophils of various in£amed colonic tissues, no NGAL mRNA expression is present (as shown by in situ hybridization) [34], despite the potential presence of proin£ammatory mediators like TNFK and GM-CSF, which are known to play a role in de novo mRNA synthesis in neutrophils [35]. The lack of mRNA expression in tissue in¢ltrating neutrophils contrasts the ¢ndings of Axelsson et al., who demonstrated synthesis of NGAL in mature neutrophils stimulated with GM-CSF in vitro [36].

Several cis-acting elements of potential importance for the expression of NGAL in myeloid cells was identi¢ed in the 5P-£anking region of the NGAL gene [17]. These include binding sites for C/EBP and PU.1, which is required for development of the myeloid lineages. Measurement of steady-state mRNA levels of NGAL in 50 human tissues by dot blot hybridization

identi¢ed several tissues besides bone marrow with signi¢cant NGAL expression. In fact, the expression was most pronounced in trachea which even surmounted the expression in the bone marrow. In addition, expression was seen in lung, stomach, salivary gland, appendix, colon, prostate, and uterus [17] (Fig. 3). This has largely been con¢rmed by immunohistochemical analysis by Friedl et al. [37], although no NGAL could be demonstrated in colon and uterus, whereas on the other hand Hassal's corpuscles of thymus, proximal tubules of kidney and small intestine were positive at the protein level. The intense signal in the trachea and lungs may originate from mucin-producing goblet cells, which are intensely stained in immunohistochemistry [37]. These ¢ndings indicate that NGAL is mainly expressed in tissues that may be exposed to microorganisms or in glands that secrete to such tissues. The tissue-speci¢c expression pattern of the NGAL analogue, K2 -microglobulin-related protein or neu-related lipocalin is consistent with the observations in humans [37], although its presence in myeloid cells including neutrophils has not been investigated. In addition, it was detected in rat mammary

After pelleting of unbroken cells and nuclei, the postnuclear supernatant was layered on a three-layer Percoll density gradient, which was subsequently high speed centrifuged. The gradient was aspirated into 35 fractions of equal size by aspiration from the bottom of the tube (the lowest fraction number with the highest density). Fractions were assayed for marker proteins as follows: myeloperoxidase (MPO), a marker for azurophil granules; lactoferrin, marker for speci¢c granules ; gelatinase, marker for gelatinase granules; latent alkaline phosphatase (latent AP), marker for secretory vesicles; HLA, marker for plasma membranes. An overlap of the distribution pro¢les of NGAL and lactoferrin indicates a subcellular localization of NGAL in speci¢c granules (upper panel) [29,30]. The NGAL^gelatinase complex is located in peroxidase negative granules containing both NGAL and gelatinase (middle panel). The lower panel shows double labeling immunogold electron microscopy of cryosectioned, human neutrophils, with antibodies against lactoferrin (labeled with protein A-20 gold particles) and NGAL (labeled with protein A-10 gold). The gold particles colocalize in the majority of the labeled granules, con¢rming the localization of NGAL in speci¢c granules [30].

tissue with maximal expression during involution of the lactating gland [7]. In mice, 24p3 or uterocalin protein has been demonstrated in neutrophils [38], but mRNA expression in bone marrow has never been investigated. In addition, expression of 24p3/uterocalin has consistently been observed in lung, spleen, and uterus by Northern blotting [39,40]. The cells responsible for its de-

tection in lung and spleen have not been identi¢ed, whereas in uterus, the protein is synthesized in luminal and glandular epithelial cells, where it is exocytozed to the uterine luminal £uid, from which the protein has also been isolated [40]. The uterine expression is regulated by estrogen and £uctuates accordingly during the estrous cycle of mice [38]. The expression is especially abundant just prior to partu-

rition and for the 2 days following, where the mRNA level increased 16- and 37-fold, respectively, in comparison to the non-pregnant uterus [12,13]. A striking observation in the study of NGAL/24p3 expression is its induction in di¡erent cell lines and tissues by a variety of stimuli. As described previously, 24p3 was originally identi¢ed as a gene highly induced during the transition of mouse kidney cells from a quiescent to a proliferative state, as a result of SV40 and polyoma virus infection [8]. 24p3/uterocalin was also identi¢ed as a major secretory product in cultured PU5.1.8 macrophages stimulated by LPS [22] and in dexamethasone stimulated mouse L-cells [39]. Furthermore, 24p3/uterocalin (SIP24) expression was observed in BALB/c 3T3 mouse ¢broblasts stimulated by serum, basic ¢broblast growth factor, and prostaglandin F2K, even more so in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating a role of an unidenti¢ed protein inhibitor in the regulation of 24p3 expression [10,11]. Prostaglandin F2K may in fact also be involved in the induction of 24p3/uterocalin during parturition, as alluded to above, since it plays an important role in the local in£ammatory response associated with labor [13]. 24p3/uterocalin has been identi¢ed as a type 1 acute phase reactant (APR), with major induction in mouse liver in an in vivo turpentine APR model, and by stimulation of mouse liver cells in vitro by TNFK or dexamethasone [10]. This is in accordance with the initial identi¢cation of K2 -microglobulin-related protein in liver after hemihepatectomy of rats [6], which may well be accompanied by an APR. Interestingly, another lipocalin with proposed immunomodulatory roles is a well-established type 1 acute phase protein, namely orosomucoid/K1 acid glycoprotein [1]. The apparent regulation of expression of 24p3/uterocalin by glucocorticoids is well explained by the presence of two glucocorticoid responsive core elements (GRE) in the 24p3 gene [10,39]. A GRE has also been identi¢ed in the NGAL promoter (unpublished observation), but the functional signi¢cance of this is not yet known. In humans, NGAL has been identi¢ed in colonic epithelial cells in areas of in£ammation by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. NGAL is present in diverse in£ammatory conditions including appendicitis, in£ammatory bowel diseases, and diverticulitis, whereas una¡ected colon displayed no or

very weak NGAL expression in epithelial cells [34] (Fig. 4). In addition, NGAL was observed in colonic cancers, which are also characterized by an intense in£ammatory, ulcerative reaction. NGAL was observed in the most super¢cial parts of the cancer, indicating that the inducing stimulus may originate from the intestinal lumen (Fig. 4). Interestingly, no expression was found in lymph node metastases from primary NGAL expressing tumors, indicating that NGAL expression is not inherent in the neoplastic cell, but rather a result of accompanying in£ammatory reactions. The NGAL inducing agents have not been identi¢ed, but based on the observations in mice, LPS and TNFK are potential candidates, although these failed to induce NGAL synthesis in T84 colon cancer cells (Bratt and Kjeldsen, unpublished observation). The expression of NGAL/24p3 in non-hematopoietic tissues and its induction during in£ammation, may involve activation of a NF-UB site, identi¢ed in the 5P-£anking region of the NGAL gene [17]. NGAL has been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in other neoplastic tissues besides colon. Friedl et al. found NGAL in lung adenocarcinomas, most profoundly in mucin-producing tumors and in some pancreatic cancers, especially those with accompanying chronic in£ammation/pancreatitis in the non-neoplastic gland remnants, which were also positive in inter- and intralobular ductules [37]. NGAL mRNA has also been demonstrated in hepatic cancers and in ovarian cancer cell lines [16,41]. In breast cancers, NGAL mRNA expression and protein levels were heterogenous, varying from undetectable, to intensive labeling of all neoplastic cells. Labeling intensity was associated with high proliferation/S-phase, but unlike the observations in rat mammary carcinomas, not related to the activation of the HER-2/neu-oncogene [7,42]. 6. NGAL in body £uids as a disease activity marker 24p3/uterocalin is not measurable in mouse serum, unless there is an ongoing APR, as exempli¢ed by the turpentine APR model [10]. The lack of measurable 24p3/uterocalin in healthy mice, may re£ect the very low blood neutrophil count of mice compared

to humans. In humans, NGAL measured in serum and plasma most likely originate from neutrophils (with their high NGAL content), that are activated in the test tube after venipuncture. This is also the case for a number of other neutrophil granule proteins [43]. In agreement with this, the content of NGAL in serum is higher than in plasma, presumably due to the generation of neutrophil activators during blood clotting. Furthermore, the NGAL concentration rises in parallel with the neutrophil count, when this is increased after intravenous administration of methylprednisolone to healthy subjects [43]. In in£ammatory bowel diseases, serum NGAL did not correlate with disease activity, but the content measured in feces and rectal dialysis £uid did [44]. Plasma or serum NGAL may therefore merely re£ect the neutrophil count, rather than being a marker of systemic leukocyte activation or an acute phase reactant. Irrespective of the origin of serum NGAL, serum NGAL was found to be a more sensitive and speci¢c marker than C-reactive protein in the discrimination between bacterial and viral infections [45]. It was not investigated whether serum NGAL measurements were superior to determination of neutrophil counts in this respect. NGAL contents of induced sputum samples were elevated in both patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma compared to healthy controls [46]. The content was higher in COPD than in asthma, possibly due to higher neutrophil counts in the COPD sputum samples. Another explanation may be di¡erences in the NGAL expression within the tracheo-bronchial epithelium in these diseases, according to the presence of NGAL in mucin-producing cells of the `healthy' mucosa [37]. The NGAL^gelatinase complex has been identi¢ed by gelatin zymography or Western blotting in saliva samples from patients with periodontitis and from Sjo «gren syndrome patients and in bronchial lavage £uid from patients with emphysema [47^49]. This indicates an origin of NGAL from neutrophils and a potential role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of these diseases. 7. Function of NGAL The function of NGAL is not yet known.

Although associated with neutrophil gelatinase, NGAL does not directly a¡ect the activity of gelatinase [3,50]. Indirectly it does, however. Approximately 50% of the NGAL^gelatinase complex isolated from human neutrophils exist in a ternary complex with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). Gelatinase in this ternary complex has a 10-fold lower activity when activated, than the forms of gelatinase not associated with TIMP-1 [50]. The rodent analogues of NGAL are not associated with gelatinase, indicating that this well conserved lipocalin may have other important functions. The striking pattern of expression mainly in neutrophils and in tissues exposed to microorganisms, resembles the distribution of other neutrophil proteins, lysozyme, lactoferrin, hCAP-18 and of tear lipocalin/ von Ebner's gland protein, which all possess antimicrobial activity [51^53]. Antimicrobial activity of NGAL per se has not yet been demonstrated, but it is possible that NGAL may bind microbicidal, lipophilic ligands in vivo, ligands not present in the isolated native or recombinant protein. It is also conceivable, that NGAL serves a role as a cofactor necessary for microbial killing induced by other proteins. The tissue expression of NGAL, its induction in murine macrophages and hepatocytes by LPS and TNFK, respectively, and its intense synthesis in in£amed colon, point to another putative function of NGAL, namely as a modulator of the in£ammatory response. This would be in accordance with actions of other lipocalins, K1 -microglobulin and orosomucoid/K1 acid glycoprotein, which both inhibit neutrophil functional responses in vitro [1]. The proposed binding of fMLP by NGAL would ¢t this hypothesis, and would imply that the neutrophil or tissues involved in an in£ammatory reaction liberate a protein, which downregulates the in£ammatory response, maybe to limit the ensuing tissue damage. Against this hypothesis is the observation, that preincubation of neutrophils with NGAL (10 WM), was unable to inhibit the rise in intracellular calcium elicited by fMLP at 1 nM [27], a response necessary for many neutrophil functional responses. Furthermore, as described previously, the crystallographic data do not support fMLP as the true NGAL ligand (Goetz et al., manuscript submitted). Other mechanisms than binding of formyl peptides may be responsible

for an immunomodulatory action of NGAL, yet to be demonstrated. The induction of 24p3/uterocalin synthesis by an array of growth factors and during the transition of kidney cells from a quiescent to a proliferating state may indicate a role of the protein in regulation of cellular growth. The expression of NGAL in in£amed colon with supposedly rapid epithelial turnover, and in various malignant tumors support this hypothesis. Further studies are necessary in order to determine the true functional role of NGAL. The determination of NGAL structure may help in the identi¢cation of the true NGAL ligand and thereby aid the future investigation of NGAL function.
