ABSTRACT Bovine seminal ribonuclease, a homodimeric enzyme joined covalently by two interchain disulphide bonds, is an equilibrium mixture of two conformational isomers, M M and M M. The major form, M M, whose crystal structure has been previously determined at 1.9 Å resolution, presents the swapping of the N-terminal segments (residues 1­15) and composite active sites formed by residues of different chains. The three-dimensional domain swapping does not occur in the M M form. The different fold of each N-terminal tail is directed by the hinge loop (residue 16 ­22) connecting the swapping domain to the body of the protein. Reduction and alkylation of interchain disulphide bridges produce a monomeric derivative and a noncovalent swapped dimer, which are both active. The free and nucleotide-bound forms of the monomer have been crystallized at an alkaline pH and refined at 1.45 and 1.65 Å resolution, respectively. In both cases, the N-terminal fragment is folded on the main body of the protein to produce an intact active site and a chain architecture very similar to that of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease. In this new fold of the seminal chain, the hinge loop is disordered. Despite the difference between the tertiary structure of the monomer and that of the chains in the M M form, the active sites of the two enzymes are virtually indistinguishable. Furthermore, the structure of the liganded enzyme represents the first example of a ribonuclease complex studied at an alkaline pH and provides new information on the binding of a nucleotide when the catalytic histidines are deprotonated.

formation and appears to play an essential role in the growth and establishment of several types of human tumors.2,3 Onconase is toxic to tumor cells and is currently being tested in Phase II clinical tests.4 Among RNases with special bioactions, the homodimeric BS-RNase has a peculiar role.5 It is the only known dimeric enzyme in the vertebrate superfamily, and its subunits are crosslinked by two adjacent disulphide bonds involving Cys31 and Cys32. The native enzyme is an equilibrium mixture of two conformational isomers, M M ( 70%) and M M.6,7 The former is characterized by the interchange of N-terminal segments (residues 1­15) between subunits,8 which creates two composite active sites. The domain swapping provides the potential for communication between the active sites and is supposed to be the source of the mixed cooperativity displayed by M M.9 By contrast, the less abundant M M form shows typical Michaelis­Menten kinetics and is considered to be unswapped,10 although the structure elucidation of this dimer has not yet been reported. The two different folds of N-terminal helices are directed by the hinge peptide (residues 16 ­22) that connects the exchanging domain to the rest of the protein. The interchain disulphide bridges of BS-RNase can be selectively reduced and alkylated to produce a mixture of a noncovalent dimer (NCD), generated from M M, and a monomer (M), generated from M M, both fully active.6,10 Both M M and the monomer do not possess the special biologic actions characteristic of the M M dimer.6,7

BS-RNase also represents a key system in the study of protein assembly into oligomers. The role of the threedimensional (3D) domain swapping in the protein oligomerization has been extensively reviewed.11,12 This phenomenon, which seems to occur in various proteins at high concentration under partially destabilizing conditions,13 has also been invoked to explain amyloid fiber formation.14,15 The swapping usually involves either the N- or the C-terminus domain, but there are examples of swapping of more than one domain in the same protein. In this context, the structural analysis of BS-RNase multiple forms, produced either by the interchange of the N-termini (M M) with respect to the unswapped dimer (M M) and/or by the breaking of the interchain disulphides (NCD and M), is of particular interest for a better understanding of the swapping process. We focus in this article on the structural properties of the carboxyamidomethylated monomeric derivative of BSRNase (MCAM), which was obtained from the native enzyme by reduction of the interchain bridges followed by reaction with iodoacetamide.16 The monomer has a lower thermal stability if compared to bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A),17,18 the monomeric prototype of the family. The secondary structure of the monomeric BSRNase was previously studied by homonuclear 1H NMR spectra.19 Here, we report the crystal structure of the free and liganded MCAM at a resolution of 1.45 and 1.65 Å, respectively. The results are also relevant for the structural organization of the unswapped dimer M M. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the liganded monomer represents the first ribonuclease complex studied at an alkaline pH and provides new information on the binding mode of a nucleotide when the catalytic histidines are deprotonated. Coordinates of the two refined models have been deposited in the PDB with entry codes 1N1X and 1N3Z for the free and liganded monomeric derivative of BS-RNase, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS MCAM Preparation The monomeric derivative of BS-RNase was prepared by selective reduction of the interchain disulphides and carboxyamidomethylation of the exposed sulphidryls, as previously described.20 Briefly, BS-RNase (7.1 mg/mL) was reduced with a ten-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol (DTT) at pH 8.4 in 0.1 M TRIS-HCl. Under these conditions, only the interchain disulphides are cleaved.16 We measured the protein concentration on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 17 UV-VIS spectrophotometer using the absorption coefficient 0.465 mg 1cm 1mL at 278 nm. The free SH groups were then carboxyamidomethylated in the dark with iodoacetamide in two-fold molar excess with respect to DTT. After 20 min, the mixture was filtered through a column (1.5 25 cm) of Biogel P-2 equilibrated in a 3 M solution of urea in ammonium acetate (AMAC) 0.1 M at pH 5.1. MCAM was then purified by HPLC gel-filtration chromatography (Perkin Elmer model 410 BIO) on a

column of Superdex G-75 (3.0 60 cm) equilibrated in AMAC 0.2 M at pH 5.1 at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Measurement of the enzymatic activity of MCAM on yeast RNA by Kunitz assay21 indicated that this derivative preserves a functional active site. Protein homogeneity was judged by native and SDS gel electrophoresis performed on a Phast System (Pharmacia Biotech). Crystallization and Data Collection MCAM was crystallized both as free enzyme and in the presence of the dinucleotide UpA. The previously reported crystallization conditions of MCAM22 produced thin, platelike crystals diffracting at a resolution not better than 2.6 Å. After several attempts, a remarkable improvement of crystal quality was obtained by the addition of various cosolutes (acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2-propanol) to the precipitant mixture. The best crystals were grown by the vapor-diffusion method at room temperature from sitting drops obtained by mixing 2 L protein (7.5 mg/mL in water) and 2 L precipitant solution containing 28% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4K), 0.1 M TRIS-HCl (pH 8.7), 0.2 M sodium acetate, and 15% (v/v) acetonitrile (final pH 8.8), equilibrated against 750 L of the reservoir. Single crystals with typical dimensions of 1.0 0.3 0.1 mm were obtained after a week. Cocrystals of MCAM with UpA were grown under the same conditions as those for free enzyme but with a lower protein concentration (5.0 mg/mL) and in the presence of a 30:1 nucleotide­protein molar ratio. Crystal size and morphology were similar to those of the unliganded protein. Diffraction data were collected with a synchrotron radiation source at ELETTRA (Trieste) with a MAR 345 scanner (MAR Research) and a wavelength of 1.0 ­1.45 Å resolution for the free enzyme and to 1.65 Å resolution for the liganded protein. We cryocooled both crystals at 100 K, using 17% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant after a stepwise transfer. X-ray data were processed using the HKL package.23 The unit cell parameters and a summary of dataprocessing statistics are presented in Table I. The crystals are isomorphous, and the Matthews parameter suggests the presence of one monomer per asymmetric unit (VM 2.22 and 2.14 Å3Da 1 for the free and liganded MCAM, respectively). Structure Solution and Refinement Free MCAM We determined the structure of the free monomer with the molecular replacement method, using a search model obtained from the coordinates of M M (PDB code: 1BSR). This structure can be described in terms of two structural units, each formed by the segment 1­15 (T1) of one chain and 23­124 (B2) of the other and vice versa (T2/B1). One of these structural units was used as search model. Data in the range of 10 ­3 Å were used for both the rotation and translation search. Using AmoRe,24 we obtained a clear solution with a correlation coefficient of 64% and an R factor of 37.2%.

8.0 to 1.45 Å, were alternated with manual model revisions with the interactive computer graphics O program, implemented on a Silicon Graphics workstation.26 New positions for a few sidechains were identified, and two alternative conformations were modeled for nine residues. The Fo-Fc map was used to define the structure of the missing hinge loop. Despite the high resolution of the diffraction data and the overall excellent quality of the electron density maps, the hinge region 17­21 could not be traced. For these residues, only a few patches of weak density were present even in the final residual map. Solvent molecules were included in the model only if they displayed an electron density higher than 3 in the Fo-Fc maps, and if they were at hydrogen-bonding distance from the appropriate atoms. Water sites in the proximity of the residues in multiple conformations were refined with the same occupancies of the appropriate sidechains. The occupancy was fixed to 0.5 for water molecules with a temperature factor (B) greater than 55 Å2. The molecules having half occupancy, with B still greater than 55 Å2, were excluded from the refinement. The bulk solvent correction was applied by the mask method in the final cycles of refinement, extending the diffraction data to the resolution range 18.0 ­1.45 Å. At convergence, the final model contains 146 water molecules and has an Rworking of 20.5% and an Rfree of 25.8%. The structure has a good stereochemistry, as tested with PROCHECK.27 Refinement statistics and geometrical parameters for the final model are shown in Table I. Liganded MCAM The MCAM refined model, in which all water molecules in the vicinity of the B1, P1, and B2 subsites1 had been removed, was used as a starting point for the analysis of the liganded enzyme. The initial rigid body refinement converged to an Rworking of 21.4% with the use of data in the range 10 ­3 Å. A refinement procedure similar to that used for the free enzyme was applied. We searched the inhibitor molecule using both Fo-Fc maps and the observed difference Fourier maps with coefficient ( FO2 FO1 )ei calc. Here, FO1 and FO2 are the structure factors of unliganded and liganded enzyme, respectively, and calc are the phases of the free monomer model containing the active-site water molecules. On the basis of the isomorphous difference map, a molecule of adenosine was modeled in the B2 subsite, and a molecule of 3 -UMP was identified in the B1 subsite. The low value of the average electron density indicates that the two nucleotides had a partial occupancy, which refined to a value of 0.40. The electron density of the overall structure was as clear as that calculated for the unliganded form. No density was observed for residues 17­21 of the hinge peptide. The final Rworking and Rfree were 18.6% and 23.0%, respectively. The refined model, which has five residues with a double conformation and 149 water molecules, presents a good stereochemistry, with no residue falling in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran map. Table I summarizes the refinement and quality of the final model.

Least-squares superpositions of MCAM structures with those of other RNases were performed with the program LSQAB.28 The figures were generated using the O,26 MOLSCRIPT,29 and BOBSCRIPT30 programs. Enzymatic and Nonenzymatic Cleavage of UpA The cleavage of UpA and U p was followed by HPLC, and the composition of the samples, withdrawn at various times, was analyzed on a Beckman ultrasphere ODS column 5 m (4.6 mm 25 cm). A good separation was obtained when a 10 min isocratic elution [0.2 M ammonium cloride in 0.1 M acetic acid buffer pH 4.4 (79 % v/v), water (20% v/v) and acetonitrile (1% v/v)] was followed by a linear gradient (15 min) up to 9% v/v acetonitrile. We analyzed the UpA stability in the presence and in the absence of MCAM using samples that reproduce the crystallization conditions (enzyme 0.36 mM and/or UpA 0.011 M). The only exception was the concentration of PEG 4K, which was set to 20% w/v to avoid crystal nucleation. The samples were diluted 100-fold with 0.1 M TRIS-HCl (pH 8.7) prior to injection on the column. The enzymatic and nonenzymatic hydrolysis of U p was carried out in 0.1 M TRIS-HCl (pH 8.7) and 0.2 M sodium acetate. The enzymatic assays were performed at a nucleotide/MCAM ratio of 250:1. The same U p concentration (900 M) was used in the experiments carried out in the absence of MCAM. All experiments were performed at 20°C and repeated three times. The percentage of cleaved nucleotides was calculated from the peak area at 260 nm. RESULTS Overall Structures We refined the crystal structures of free and liganded MCAM using diffraction data extending up to 1.45 and 1.65 Å resolution, respectively. Most of the amino acid residues are very well defined in the electron density map, with the exception of the hinge residues 17­21, which could not be modeled. The two structures are very similar and the RMSD for C atoms is 0.103 Å. The MCAM model (Fig. 1) is similar to that of the structural unit of the M M dimer6,8 formed by the N-tail T1 of one subunit and the body B2 of the other or vice versa (T2/B1). However, though in the present structures the connecting peptide is not visible, the N-tail and the body are clearly part of the same chain. The carboxamidomethylated sidechains of Cys31 and Cys32, which form the interchain disulphide bridges in the native protein, have very well-defined electron density. Cys32 sidechain is hydrogen-bonded to three highly ordered water molecules (Fig. 2). Two water molecules are also linked to residue 31. Overall, MCAM compares well with other RNases such as the free8 and complexed31,32 M M dimer of BS-RNase, PM7,33 and 1 7,34 two variants of human pancreatic RNase, and the atomic resolution structures of RNase A at different pHs.35 The least-squares superposition of these structures shows that the larger deviations are associated with a few exposed loops. In particular, the RMSD be-

tween MCAM and each of the two structural units of M M (PDB code: 1BSR), computed considering the C atoms, is 0.543 and 1.139 Å for T2/B1 and T1/B2, respectively. The different conformation of the loop 65­72 in B2 accounts for the higher value of RMSD, which decreases to 0.594 Å when this loop is omitted from the structure comparison. Active Site Similar to RNase A, BS-RNase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the RNA POO5 bond in two steps: a transphosphorylation step to form a 2 , 3 cyclic phosphodiester, followed by a hydrolytic reaction of the cyclic product to yield a

3 -phosphomonoester.1,6,7 The close similarity of the catalytic function of the two enzymes also corresponds to a strict invariance of the residues, which line the subsites P1, B1, and B2. The only notable exception is Gly111, positioned on the far side of B2. In RNase A, this position is occupied by a glutamic acid, which appears to be involved in catalysis solely when the nucleobase in B2 is guanosine.36 The phosphate group of the scissile phosphodiester bond is accommodated in P1, where it interacts with the catalytic triad His12, Lys41, and His119. Free MCAM The active-site architecture shows a strict similarity with that of M M and of the other monomeric members of the family. In comparison with the M M structure, the MCAM model lacks the active-site sulphate ion, which is replaced by three water molecules. The absence of the sulphate, which is usually taken up by the protein during the purification, is very likely due to the high pH of the crystallization mixture used for MCAM ( 8.7) with respect to that used for the native protein ( 5.5).8 Indeed, at an alkaline pH, the deprotonation of the catalytic histidines induces the sulphate release from P1.37,38 The position of His12 is well defined, with its ND1 hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Thr45. NE2 interacts with WAT201, which is hydrogen-bonded to WAT205 and to the amino group of Phe120. In both pancreatic and seminal RNase, His119 usually displays a high mobility and often adopts two alternate conformations, referred to as A (trans) and B (gauche) conformations.8,38,39 B conformation is not compatible with a dinucleotide bound at the active site.31,40 In the uncomplexed enzymes at basic pH, the deprotonated His119 prefers the A conformation, which is stabilized by the strong interaction with the neighboring Asp121.38,41 This is also the conformation found in the present structure, in which ND1 interacts with WAT283, and NE2 forms a bifurcate hydrogen bond with WAT206 and with OD1 of Asp121. Lys41 has a single conformation and its NZ is H-bonded to OD1 of Asn44, OE1 of Gln11, and WAT271. A similar conformation of the lysine sidechain was also observed for two variants of human pancreatic RNase, whose crystals were grown in conditions very similar to those used to crystallize MCAM.33,34 In these structures, the electron density map is well defined and shows no trace of the high pH conformer found in the analysis of RNase A at various pHs.35 For RNase A crystals equilibrated at pH lower than 8.0, the sidechain of Lys41 was found to point into the active site, whereas at higher pH, the sidechain was located in a more positive region, away from the active site. This conformational change was attributed to the deprotonation of Lys41, which is characterized by a particularly low pKa.42 According to this interpretation, the presence of the Lys41 sidechain in the active site of the two MCAM structures would indicate that the residue is still protonated at the pH of the crystallization medium ( 8.7). These results can be reconciled by considering that the RNase A crystals were grown from solutions containing a high

percentage of isopropanol, which may effectively decrease the pKa of Lys41. Liganded MCAM The presence of the ligand was initially inspected by means of Fo-Fc maps calculated with the use of the refined model of unliganded MCAM and by omitting the water molecules in the vicinity of the active site. In this region, the map revealed the presence of a residual density in the B2 subsite, where an adenosine moiety could be accommodated. On the other hand, the residual density in B1 was dominated by the contribution of water molecules, which had the same location as in the free monomer, whereas the remaining density could not be easily interpreted. We obtained a much clearer density with the isomorphous difference map, using the phase set of the unliganded model that included the water molecules of the catalytic site. Size and shape of the residual density of this map clearly corresponded to a 3 -UMP molecule in B1 [Fig. 3(a)] and confirmed the presence of an adenosine moiety in B2 [Fig. 3(b)]. The refined occupancy factor of these fragments is 0.40. The large electron density gap between the phosphate group and the adenosine indicates that the two fragments do not belong to the same molecule. The interpretation of the map is further validated by the contacts of the nucleotides with the protein matrix. In the uridine ring, O2 and N3 atoms are bound to the amide N and to OG1 of Thr45, respectively [Fig. 3(c)]. In addition, OG1 is H-bonded to OD1 of Asp83, an interaction found only when a uridine is located in B1.31,43,44 The uridine O4 is engaged in hydrogen bonds with two water molecules, which bridge the nucleobase to Ser123 and Asp83, respectively. A similar solvent-mediated interaction between the nucleotide and the protein was found in the complex of M M with UpA.31 Despite the close match of the uridine position with that found in other complexes,31,43,44 the phosphate group of 3 -UMP is not located in P1, which contains two water molecules hydrogen-bonded to the catalytic histidines. The phosphate is almost 3 Å from the position occupied in the crystalline structures of RNase A with bound monucleotides.40,44,45 This displacement is evident in Figure 3(d), which compares the structures of 3 -UMP complexed with MCAM (cyan) and with an RNase A mutant44 (magenta). In the new position, the phosphate maintains the interactions with Gln11, whereas the typical H-bonds to His12, His119, Lys41, and Phe120 are lost. The 3 -UMP ribose is also rotated, compared to its expected position and bears no interactions with the protein, its oxygen atoms being H-bonded to solvent molecules. The conformation about the uridine glycosidic linkage is anti and the pucker of ribose ring is C1 -exo. In the adenosine moiety modeled in B2, the adenine ring is only weakly hydrogen-bonded to Asn71. The nucleobase presents the usual stacking interactions, with His119 in the A conformation, and with the minor conformer of Gln69,31 which is absent in the unliganded MCAM. The highest electron density peaks were found in the vicinity of N6, N1, and C4 of the adenine; these peaks were fitted

with three water molecules at an occupancy complementary to that of the base. Nucleotide Cleavage The liganded MCAM was crystallized at a pH at which the nonenzymatic cleavage of UpA is not negligible. This reaction proceeds through the formation of U p, which is a substrate of MCAM.46,47 We assessed the stability of UpA under the crystallization conditions by measuring the extent of cleavage at various times by reverse-phase chromatography. In agreement with recent data on the UpA chemical stability at alkaline pH, 48 the rate of the nonenzymatic cleavage of the dinucleotide was slow but significant. Indeed, after 15 days, about 5% of the starting product had disappeared. This result did not change when the experiments were repeated in the presence of MCAM, which does not recognize the 2 -5 phosphodiester linkage.1 On the basis of our data, the amount of U p formed during the preparation of the crystals for data collection (2 weeks) can be estimated to be as much as two times that of the protein present in solution. In order to assess the ability of MCAM to process the cyclic nucleotide at the basic conditions used to grow the crystals, the enzyme was incubated in 0.1 M TRIS-HCl (pH 8.7) and 0.2 M sodium acetate with an excess of U p (1:250). We carried out control experiments by incubating the substrate without any added MCAM. The hydrolysis was monitored by reverse-phase chromatographic analysis of aliquots of the reaction mixtures. Within 24 h, almost all the substrate was cleaved by MCAM, whereas only about 3­ 4% of it was cleaved by alkaline hydrolysis in the control tests. These findings indicate that during the growth of the liganded MCAM crystals, the nonenzymatic cleavage of UpA yields a sufficient amount of U p, which is rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme. DISCUSSION Free MCAM Structure The structure of the BS-RNase monomeric form proves that the seminal chain can adopt the tertiary structure typical of RNase A, with the N-terminus folded on its own body to produce an intact active site. Although this result was largely expected on the basis of the enzymatic properties of the monomer,6 the X-ray analysis shows that the relative positions of the two domains are practically indistinguishable, whether the two regions come from the same chain, as in MCAM (and, presumably, in M M), or from different chains, as in M M. Thus, the interactions at the closed C interface11 are unperturbed by the swapping at any significant level. However, the loop region encompassing residues 16 ­22 (hinge peptide) is fully disordered in MCAM, in agreement with previous NMR data.19 This loop shows some degrees of conformational variability also in the structure of free and complexed crystals of M M.31 In these cases, however, the conformation is characterized by the presence of a type I -bend motif, which has Pro19 in the second position. This motif is not compatible with

the chain folding of the monomer, and the hinge peptide is apparently unable to find an alternative low-energy conformation. By contrast, this loop in RNase A is well adsorbed on the protein matrix. It should be pointed out that in this region, the pancreatic enzyme has four residues mutated with respect to the seminal enzyme, and, in particular, Pro19 is replaced with alanine. The disorder of the hinge peptide was also observed in the structure of the PM7 variant of human pancreatic RNase.33 This engineered protein was designed by mutating five residues in the segment 1­23 to reproduce the BS-RNase sequence. In the crystal structure of PM7, the peptide 18 ­21 does not show an appreciable electron density. All these findings suggest that the aminoacidic sequence of BS-RNase and, in particular, the presence of a proline in position 19, was selected during evolution to favor the conformation of the hinge peptide required for the interchange of the N-termini. Theoretical energy calculations performed on the A19P mutant of RNase A9 have shown that, within the constraints imposed by the monomeric folding, Pro19 severely limits the conformational space accessible to the hinge peptide. The allowed conformations have high energy and only few interactions with the protein matrix. Interestingly, in full agreement with this earlier prediction, the monomeric form of BS-RNase has been found to be thermodynamically less stable than RNase A, with respect to both temperature- and urea-induced denaturation.17,18 The marked decrease of thermal stability, as highlighted by a 6° decrease in the melting temperature,18 is mainly due to enthalpic factors, which are only partially counterbalanced by entropic contributions. These data further confirm the key role played by Pro19 in weakening the interactions between the hinge segment and the main body of BS-RNase in the unswapped fold. Liganded Protein Structure Good-quality crystals of MCAM were successfully grown only at an alkaline pH, which is known to significantly reduce the binding of nucleotides to RNase A.49 For this reason, the crystals of the complex with UpA were grown in a very large excess of the ligand. The X-ray analysis allowed us to model unambiguously in B1 and B2 two separate nucleotides, 3 -UMP and adenosine, respectively. The presence of these ligands was unexpected, because it is well known that 2 ,5 linked dinucleotides are inhibitors of RNases, which, conversely, catalyze the cleavage of a 3 ,5 phosphodiester linkage. The isomerization of 2 -5 to 3 -5 linked dinucleotides in alkaline solutions is not relevant.46,47 However, both isomers can be hydrolyzed nonenzymatically at pH 8 via the intermediate 2 ,3 cyclic phosphate to a mixture of 2 - and 3 -monophosphate in a comparable amount.46,47 In addition, the binding constants of 2 - and 3 -pyrimidine mononucleotides to BS-RNase do not differ significantly at pH 5, 50 and 2 -nucleotides have even greater affinity for RNase A than the 3 -isomers in the pH range 4.0 ­7.0.51 Thus, the presence of 3 -UMP in the B1 subsite of MCAM can only be explained by assuming an alkaline nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the starting dinucleotide to U p and adenosine,

followed by the enzymatic hydrolysis of the cyclic mononucleotide. This hypothesis is in agreement with control experiments of the cleavage of UpA and of U p carried out in the presence and in the absence of MCAM, in conditions similar to those used in the crystallization trials. In these experiments, the percentage of cleaved UpA, generally rather low, is approximately independent of the presence of MCAM, whereas the enzymatic hydrolysis of U p is significantly faster than the alkaline hydrolysis. From a structural point of view, the liganded MCAM model represents the first picture of a nucleotide bound to a ribonuclease whose catalytic histidines are unprotonated. Upon switching off the attractive coulombic forces, which hold the phosphate group in P1, the anion moves away from P1 to reach a position where it is more exposed to the solvent. Under these conditions, the nucleotide binding is assured by the interactions involving the nucleobases. In particular, the uridine base preserves its typical H-bonds with Thr45, the residue that determines the pyrimidine specificity of RNases. Adenosine is also correctly oriented to maintain the stacking interactions with His119 and Gln69. However, the orientation within the plane is less well defined. These findings highlight the importance of non-electrostatic contributions to the stabilization of the RNase­nucleic acid complexes and give further evidence of the well-known hierarchy of the B1 and B2 nucleotide-binding site in the substrate recognition. CONCLUSIONS This article presents the first 3D characterization of a monomeric form of BS-RNase. In contrast with the pancreatic enzyme, the peptide 17­21, which connects the Nterminal region to the rest of the protein, is fully disordered. This feature is mainly (but not only) attributed to the presence of a proline in position 19 of the seminal chain. The tertiary structure of the monomer is different from that of the two chains in M M and provides the basis to model the structure of M M, the putative unswapped isomer of M M. With use of the quaternary organization of M M, mainly directed by the interchain disulphide bonds active in both dimers, the most simple model of M M can be obtained by incorporating the relevant structural details of MCAM in M M. The model is characterized by active sites indistinguishable from those of M M and by disordered hinge peptides. Preliminary X-ray data of M M crystals are in line with these predictions, although better quality crystals are currently being sought. On the basis of this model, the higher stability of M M relative to M M17 may be mainly attributed to enthalpic factors, which are only partially counterbalanced by the increased disorder of the M M hinge peptides and the greater flexibility of its quaternary structure. Furthermore, in the M M structure, the two active sites are structurally uncoupled or significantly less coupled than in the M M dimer. Interestingly, functional studies show large cooperative effects for the latter form6 that are absent in M M,10 as well as in the monomeric species.
