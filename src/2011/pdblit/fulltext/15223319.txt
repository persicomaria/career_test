Domain Arrangement of Der, a Switch Protein Containing Two GTPase Domains
Victoria L. Robinson,2 Jihwan Hwang,1 Eileen Fox,2 Masayori Inouye,1 and Ann M. Stock1,2,3 1 Department of Biochemistry UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School 675 Hoes Lane Piscataway, New Jersey 08854 2 Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine 679 Hoes Lane Piscataway, New Jersey 08854 motifs [6]. A wealth of data has been accumulated for the elongation factor subfamily, which includes EF-Tu and EF-G. However, the other GTPase subfamilies, designated as the FtsY, Obg, and Era subfamilies, are not as well characterized. A distinctive member of the Era subfamily of GTPases, EngA, is unique among both prokaryotic and eukaryotic GTPases by virtue of its domain architecture. EngA orthologs, present in all bacterial genomes and Arabidopsis [6­8], are the only known proteins that contain two adjacent GTP binding domains, linked by a variable length acidic region. Although the exact function of these proteins has not been elucidated, studies have revealed that the Escherichia coli EngA homolog, Der, [9] and Neisseria gonorrhoeae EngA [10] are essential for cell viability. A recent report suggests that E. coli Der functions in ribosome assembly and stability [11]. The unique domain arrangement of the EngA proteins raises a number of novel possibilities as to how the classic GTP/GDP switch mechanism can be coupled to inter- and intramolecular regulation [6]. Each GTPase domain may influence the other's activity and, in turn, may modulate or be modulated though contacts with the C-terminal domain. Amino acid sequence similarities in the G-2 or effector loop regions of the GTPase domains within a single protein raise the possibility that the two domains may interact with the same partner in a sequential manner. Alternatively, associations with different partners concurrently or successively could allow this protein to synchronize GTP/GDP cycling with different cellular processes. Thus, an analysis of the domain interactions is critical to an overall understanding of the action of the EngA proteins. Here we report the crystal structure of the GDP-bound form of Thermotoga maritima Der (TM-Der), an EngA ° family member, at 1.9 A resolution. The GTPase domains of the protein, termed GD1 and GD2, resemble those of other GTP binding proteins, with several exceptions, including variations in the amino acid sequence of the conserved motifs in the nucleotide binding site. The topology of the previously uncharacterized C-terminal domain is analogous to a KH domain that lacks the structural features that confer RNA binding. An analysis of the interdomain interactions indicates distinct relationships between the KH domain and the individual GTPase domains. Thus, the two GTPase domains may make different contributions to the regulation of the protein. Results and Discussion The Structure of TM-Der ° The structure of T. maritima Der was solved at 1.9 A resolution by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) with selenium.

Summary The EngA subfamily of essential bacterial GTPases has a unique domain structure consisting of two adjacent GTPase domains (GD1 and GD2) and a C-terminal domain. The structure of Thermotoga maritima Der ° bound to GDP determined at 1.9 A resolution reveals a novel domain arrangement in which the GTPase domains pack at either side of the C-terminal domain. Unexpectedly, the C-terminal domain resembles a KH domain, missing the distinctive RNA recognition elements. Conserved motifs of the nucleotide binding site of GD1 are integral parts of the GD1-KH domain interface, suggesting the interactions between these two domains are directly influenced by the GTP/GDP cycling of the protein. In contrast, the GD2-KH domain interface is distal to the GDP binding site of GD2. Introduction GTPases constitute a superfamily of switch molecules that utilize the conformational changes associated with GTP/GDP cycles to elicit responses from target proteins. These proteins play key regulatory roles in processes such as signaling, translation, and protein targeting [1­3]. GTPases share a common structural core, exemplified by the Ras protein [2]. GTPase domains are comprised of a six-stranded sheet surrounded by five helices. Five conserved motifs, G-1 through G-5, contain residues involved in nucleotide binding. Conformational changes between the GTP- and GDP-bound states of various G proteins are localized to two distinct regions of the protein, termed switch I and switch II. The extent of these changes is different in each family of proteins. For example, structural differences in the GTP- and GDP-bound states of Ras are quite minimal [4], whereas the GTP/GDP cycling of Ran involves relocation of the entire C terminus of the protein [5]. Small G proteins are ubiquitous in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. Although not as numerous as their eukaryotic counterparts, prokaryotic GTPases play essential roles in the life cycles of bacteria. Bacterial GTPases can be subdivided into four major families on the basis of sequence similarities in their G-1 and G-2

These mutations greatly improved the size, mosaicity, and diffraction limits of the subsequently grown selenomethionine crystals. Figure 1A illustrates the locations

of the endogenous and engineered methionine residues. As expected, the five mutated methionines lie within the hydrophobic core of the two GTPase domains.

GTPase Activities of TM-Der GTP hydrolysis activities of wild-type TM-Der (Der), selenomethionine-substituted TM-Der (SeMet-Der), full-length TM-Der with N118D substitution (GD1 G-4 Mutation), TM-Der with N300D substitution (GD2 G-4 Mutation), TM-Der with both substitutions, N118D and N300D (GD1 and GD2 Mutations), and the isolated domain constructs (GD1, GD2, and GD2-KH) were determined as described in the Experimental Procedures.

drolysis activity of 0.11 mol phosphate mol protein 1 min 1. Selenomethionine-derivitized protein has comparable activity. To examine how nucleotide binding in one domain affects the other, we made substitutions within the conserved G-4 motifs (NKXD) in the full-length protein. The highly conserved asparagine and aspartate make specific hydrogen bonds to the bound guanine nucleotide [2]. Mutations were designed on the basis of the study of Walter et al. indicating that substitutions of the asparagine in the G-4 motif of Ras significantly reduced the nucleotide affinity of the protein [12]. Asparagine to aspartate substitutions were made in the G-4 motifs of the full-length TM-Der at residues 118 and 300 and also at both sites. Our data indicate that disruption of the nucleotide binding site in GD1 significantly decreases the GTPase activity of the protein, whereas a similar substitution in GD2 slightly increases the overall activity of the protein. Assays of individual domain constructs indicate that both GD1 and GD2 have GTPase activity. The GTPase hydrolysis activity of the isolated GD1 domain approximates that of the full-length protein and is twice that of the isolated GD2 domain. GTPase activity is further decreased in a construct composed of both the GD2 and KH domains (GD2-KH). Therefore, the individual GTPase domains behave distinctly within the context of the intact protein. They also possess different intrinsic GTPase activities in their isolated states. These data are suggestive of multiple levels of regulation within TM-Der.

leaf shape (Figure 1B). A short linker consisting of residues 171­179 connects the two GTPase domains, with the C-terminal domain packed between them. The fold of the C-terminal domain could not be predicted from primary sequence analysis. The structure revealed that this domain consists of four strands and two helices, with the topology of a KH domain, a module often associated with RNA binding. The solvent-exposed nucleotide binding pockets of the GTPase domains, outlined in red in Figure 1B, are located at opposite ends of the ° protein, 54 A apart. Regions of disorder in both GTPase domains, characterized by a lack of traceable electron density, include the switch I region of GD1 (residues 2437) and the switch I and II regions of GD2 (residues 213­218 and 239­249). Increased mobility in these segments is not unexpected, as unbound and GDP-bound forms of many GTPases exhibit structural flexibility in these areas, in contrast to their GTP-bound counterparts [3]. Electron density unequivocally representative of a GDP molecule was present in the GD2 subunit. The remainder of the molecule, including the N and C termini, is well resolved.

GTP Hydrolysis Activities To assess how the interdomain interactions in TM-Der may contribute to the GTPase activity of the protein, several domain constructs as well as mutations designed to inhibit GTP binding to individual domains of the protein were engineered and characterized (Figure 2). Wild-type TM-Der, assayed at 70 C, has GTPase hy-

Domain Interfaces The two GTPase domains in the protein do not interact. Instead, the interdomain interfaces of TM-Der are formed between the KH domain and each individual ° GTPase domain. The GD1-KH interface is 620 A2 (Figure 3A). The primary contacts in this interface are made between the switch regions of GD1 and the first helix of the KH domain. Specifically, Asp-55 and Cys-57 of the GD1 G-3 motif (DTXG), part of the switch II loop, form hydrogen bonds with Ser-367 of the KH domain. Additionally, two endogenous methionine residues, Met71 and Met-78, contact the hydrophobic surface of the 2 strand in the KH domain. Perturbations in the switch regions of GD1 resulting from nucleotide binding and hydrolysis would presumably alter the observed contacts between these two domains. GD1 is tethered to the rest of the protein through a linker. Because the interface seen in the crystal structure is small and is dictated by conformationally variable regions of the protein, it is likely that TM-Der exists in alternate conformations in solution. This hypothesis may explain our inability to readily crystallize other EngA homologs with longer linker sequences. ° The GD2-KH domain interface is 590 A2 and is composed of an extensive hydrogen bond network (Figure 3B). Two tyrosine residues, 328 and 356, constitute the core of this interface. Tyr-356 is located at the helix to strand transition defining the beginning of the KH domain. The KH domain intercalates into GD2 via a turn between 2 and 3, containing Pro-430 and Gly-428. In contrast to the direct coupling observed in the GD1-KH

The G-3 motif residues (DTCG) directly contact Ser-367 and also are involved in stabilizing two phosphates, PO1 and PO2. (B) Stereo diagram of the GD2-KH interdomain interface. Tyrosines 328 and 356 are located at the core of the GD2-KH interface. The surrounding residues are involved in an extensive hydrogen bond network.

interface, the GD2 nucleotide binding site is located at ° the opposite end of the GTPase domain, nearly 25 A from the interdomain interface. The dissimilarity in the positioning of the nucleotide binding site of each GTPase domain relative to the interdomain interfaces suggests that different modes of interdomain regulation may occur within this molecule.

Comparison of GTPase Domains 1 and 2 Both GTPase domains exhibit the typical GTPase domain fold (Figure 4A). They are superimposed with an ° rms deviation of 1.6 A for 105 C pairs that constitute the core of the GTPase domain. A substantially greater ° rms deviation of 4.4 A is obtained when all C pairs are considered in the analysis. An amino acid sequence

The dashed lines indicate undefined areas in the structure missing traceable electron density. These include residues 24­37 of GD1 and residues 213­218 and 239­249 of GD2. (B) Comparisons of the switch regions of GD1 and GD2 with GDP-bound Ras [35] (Protein Data Bank code 1Q21) and Era [13] (Protein Data Bank code 1EGA). Superpositions of backbone atoms were done with the core secondary structure elements of the paired GTPase domains. Roughly half of each GTPase domain is represented in each C trace. Dashed lines indicate undefined regions in each domain. The switch regions of each protein have been highlighted in different colors. The GD1 and GD2 switch regions are in green and blue, and the Ras and Era switch regions are in red.

comparison of GD1 and GD2 [9] indicates that the two GTPase domains are approximately 31% identical in the primary structure. There are, however, some interesting differences. In particular, the switch I region of GD1 is highly charged, whereas switch I in GD2 is much less so. Also, the switch II region of GD2 contains three more residues than its N-terminal counterpart. In the crystal structure of TM-Der, all of these regions are disordered, except the switch II region of GD1. GD1 and GD2 differ greatly in the areas surrounding their switch regions. Similar superpositions between TM-Der and the GTPase domains of two other structurally characterized bacterial GTPases, E. coli Era and EF-Tu, and the prototypical eukaryotic GTPase, Ras, suggest there is a large degree of conformational variability in many bacterial GTPases, as originally noted by Chen et al. [13]. Contributing to this flexibility are the relatively large amino acid insertions that occur in the switch I and II regions of many of these bacterial proteins [8]. For example, the switch II loop of GD1 is seven residues longer than that of Ras, and, as stated above, the GD2 switch II is even larger. The flexibility of these switch regions is evident within the context of our struc-

ture, as shown in Figures 4A and 4B. The lack of electron density and high B factors indicate that the switch regions of GD1 and GDP-bound GD2 are quite mobile. The relative positioning of the residues adjacent to the GD1 and GD2 switch regions of our structure also indicate that the orientations of these switch loops are very different. As stated previously, the lack of coordination between Mg2 , -phosphate, and the surrounding conserved sequence motifs leads to an increased flexibility in this end of the nucleotide binding cleft, a characteristic common to many GDP-bound GTPase domains [2, 3]. Only the switch II region in GD1 is well defined. This ordering is influenced by crystal contacts with the switch II region of a neighboring GD2, the corresponding linker, and the 2/ 3 hairpin loop of a second GD1, as well as intramolecular contacts with the KH domain. The Guanine Nucleotide Binding Sites of TM-Der During refinement of the structure, a GDP molecule was identified in GD2. The absence of nucleotide in our crystallization solution and the stringent purification process, including an incubation at 64 C, reveal the tight-

Structure 1654

ness of GDP binding at this site and the slow rate of GDP exchange. Overall, the conformation of the residues in the nucleotide binding site of GD2 is similar to that observed in the GDP-bound states of other small GTPases. Specifically, the N1 and N2 atoms of the guanine base form hydrogen bonds with Asp-303, the -phosphate is stabilized by interactions with Thr-195, and the backbone atoms of Asn-190 and Ser-194, as well as the side chain of Lys-193, interact with the -phosphate. No Mg2 ion is directly coordinated to the GDP in GD2, which is in contrast to several other previously published GDP-bound GTPase structures. The nucleotide binding site of GD1 has several interesting structural features. Two phosphates lie in the GD1 switch II region. These molecules approximate the positioning of the - and -phosphates of a nucleotide had a GTP been bound to this domain (Figures 3A and 5A). As discussed, the residues of the GD1 switch II region are ordered because of interdomain contacts with the KH domain. Additionally, a well-resolved water molecule occupies the position expected for a Mg2 ion, leading to speculation that we have trapped a conformation somewhat representative of the GTP-bound state of GD1. Neighboring Cys-57, part of the G-3 motif (DTCG), has phi and psi angles placing it in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Its position is dictated by interaction with the two phosphates, the water molecule, and also by contacts with residues from the KH domain. E. coli EF-Tu has a comparably positioned cysteine in its G-3 motif, and mutations at this site decrease growth rates of the bacteria [14]. Alterations in the positions of any of these G-3 motif residues would greatly affect the GD1-KH interface. The amino acids of the G-4 motif in GD1, NKAE, deviate from those of the nearly universal NKXD sequence. This is true for approximately half of the members of the EngA GTPase family. Mutation of asparagine for the invariant aspartate residue, 119 in Ras and 138 in EFTu, changes the nucleotide specificity of these proteins from GTP to XTP [15, 16]. These mutations decrease the affinity of the respective GTPase for nucleotide, primarily through increased GDP dissociation rates [17, 18]. Figures 5B and 5C illustrate the positioning of the G-4 motifs in GD2 and GD1, respectively. As in most GTPases, Asp-303 in GD2 makes a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the bound guanine base. In GD1, the equivalent residue, Glu-121, forms a hydrogen bond with Lys92. These residues and the surrounding loop region between 4 and 5 are rather flexible, as indicated by their ° relatively high B factors ( 50 A2). Nevertheless, their electron density is well defined. Interestingly, in over 80% of the EngA family members sequenced to date, which number close to 40, this residue is either a lysine or arginine, suggestive of its biochemical importance.

Figure 5. Structural Details of the Nucleotide Binding Sites of GD1 and GD2 Shown in Ball and Stick Representations (A) The GD1 nucleotide binding cleft including the G-1 and G-3 motifs. Two phosphate molecules, colored red and yellow, approximate the locations of the - and -phosphates of a nucleotide, if a GTP molecule had been bound to this domain. W1, shown in ma° genta, is an ordered water molecule (B factor, 30 A2) whose position is typically occupied by Mg2 in the GTP-bound state. The backbone of Cys-57, part of the G-3 motif, is in a stereochemically unfavorable conformation, dictated by the position of the phosphates and by its interaction with helix 1 of the KH domain. A second water molecule, W2, also colored magenta, forms hydrogen bonds with the second phosphate and with backbone atoms in the G-3 motif. (B) The G-4 motif of GD2. The residues of GD2 are consistent with the NKXD consensus of the G-4 motif, where the first and fourth residues stabilize the bound nucleotide, as shown. (C) The G-4 motif of GD1. Glu-121, part of the GD1 G-4 motif (NKAE), forms a hydrogen bond with Lys-92 and, in this conformation, would be unable to interact with guanine nucleotide. However, the temper° ature factors in this region of the structure are high, 50 A2, indicating flexibility in these residues.

KH Domain Comparisons The topology of the C-terminal domain resembles that of a KH domain. Classic KH domains were identified as RNA binding modules with a conserved VIGXXGXXI motif [19]. Residues of this motif are located on a helix-turn-helix element near the C terminus of the

The 2-turn- 2 region contains the RNA recognition consensus [19]. (B) Ribbon diagram of the C-terminal domain of TM-Der (residues 358­439). Despite similar topologies, the TM-Der domain does not have the RNA recognition elements found in the Era KH domain. (C) Comparison of the arrangement of the GTPase and KH domains of both proteins. The GD1 and KH domains of TM-Der (residues 1­170 and 358­439) and the GD2 and KH domains of TM-Der (residues 180­439) were aligned with intact Era by superposition of the GTPase domains. The KH domains, colored dark gray, surround a representative GTPase domain (GD1), colored light gray. A space-filling model of GDP delineates the nucleotide binding site.

domain (Figure 6A). There is also a second class of KH domains that are not involved in RNA binding and, therefore, lack the nucleic acid recognition elements. It is believed that members of this second class of KH domains facilitate protein-protein interactions [20]. E. coli Era, a closely related bacterial GTPase, has a single GTPase domain and a C-terminal KH domain [13]. Biochemical studies indicate that Era binds to 16S rRNA and that RNA binding modulates the GTPase activity of the protein [21­23]. It is evident that the TM-Der C-terminal domain is missing the structural features associated with RNA binding, as shown in the comparison of the E. coli Era and TM-Der KH domains in Figures 6A and 6B. Thus, the C-terminal domain of TM-Der more closely resembles the second class of KH domains that do not bind RNA.

The relative orientations of the KH and GTPase domains in TM-Der are very different than the orientation observed in the Era crystal structure (Figure 6C). The Era nucleotide binding site is near the interdomain interface, proximal to the sheet of the KH domain. In contrast, as discussed previously, the GD1 active site of TM-Der interacts with the helices on the opposite side of the KH domain, and the GD2 nucleotide binding site lies ° 25 A away from the GD2-KH interface. Thus, analogous surfaces of the GTPase domains are utilized differently, emphasizing the adaptive nature of these small GTPase modules. An analysis of the contact sites between small GTPases and their biological partners done by Corbett and Alber documents that nearly all surfaces of GTPase domains may be involved in biologically relevant interfaces [24].

Biological Implications Small GTPases modulate numerous cellular processes, such as signaling, growth and differentiation, and nuclear transport. GTPases are defined by a common structural core that undergoes specific conformational changes in response to GTP binding and hydrolysis. Bacterial GTPases, although not as well characterized as their eukaryotic counterparts, are known to play essential roles in prokaryotes. The EngA family of bacterial GTPases is unique in that it is the only family of GTPases with two adjacent GTPase domains and a small C-terminal domain. To study the interdomain interfaces of the protein, we have solved the crystal structure of T. maritima Der. Somewhat surprisingly, the two GTPase domains do not interact with one another, but instead pack on opposite faces of the C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain resembles a KH module lacking the elements required for RNA binding. GDP bound to the second GTPase domain suggests that nucleotide release from this domain is slow and that GDP binding is tight. In addition, a single variation in the G-4 motif of GD1 may alter the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties of this domain. The interdomain contacts in the protein suggest that internal regulation of the GTPase activity of the protein may be dependent upon contacts made between the nucleotide binding site of the first GTPase domain and the KH domain. Similar to many proteins, GTPases mediate their interactions with cognate partners through alterations of their surface properties. Conformations are dependent upon the nucleotide-bound states of the molecule. Subsequent structural and biochemical characterization of the different nucleotide-bound states of EngA family members, as well as genetic characterization of various mutant proteins, will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of intramolecular regulation used by these proteins and how their three-dimensional architecture dictates their overall mode of action.
Experimental Procedures Expression and Purification of Selenomethionine TM-Der To generate selenomethionine-containing protein, the plasmid pETTmDer [9] encoding TM-Der was transformed into the B834(DE-

3)pLysS strain (Novagen) and grown according to a procedure adapted from a protocol provided by J. Brannigan, R. Lewis, and A. Wilkinson. Cells from an initial 50 ml culture grown in LB medium were isolated by centrifugation (15 min at 3500 g) and washed twice with 2X-M9 minimal medium supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4, 9 M FeSO4 · 7H2O, 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 1.0 g/ml riboflavin, 1.0 g/ml niacinamide, 1.0 g/ml pyridoxine monohydrochloride, 1.0 g/ml thiamine, and 19 L-amino acids plus selenomethionine at 4 g/ml. The cells were then resuspended in the same medium to an OD595 of 0.05. The culture was grown at 37 C to an OD595 of 0.7­0.8, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested 3­4 hr after induction by centrifugation at 4 C. All protein purification steps were done at 4 C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 0.2 M NaCl, and 15 mM -mercaptoethanol ( ME). Cells were lysed by sonication, and a soluble fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation (80,000 g) for 45 min. Heat treatment at 64 C for 20 min denatured the majority of the host proteins that were subsequently removed by ultracentrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 60% saturation. Following centrifugation, the resulting ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in the buffer described above and loaded onto a 70 ml Q Sepharose High Performance ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1 M NaCl, and 15 mM ME. A 350 ml, 0.1­0.7 M NaCl gradient was applied to the column, and SeMet-TM-Der eluted at 0.4 M salt. Fractions containing TM-Der were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex75 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 0.35 M NaCl, and 15 mM ME. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated to 15 mg/ml in the same buffer. Expression and Purification of TM-Der Domain Constructs and G-4 Motif Mutant Proteins DNA fragments encoding GD1 (residues 1­170), GD2 (residues 180­ 357 and an N-terminal methionine), and GD2-KH (residues 180­439 and an N-terminal methionine) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites of pJES307 [25] to yield plasmids pRU524, pRU525, and pRU526, respectively. These plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and grown to an OD595 of 0.5­0.6. Cells were then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and grown at 37 C for 3 hr. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the protein was purified as described above, except for a slight modification of the ion exchange step. A 70 ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) was used, which was equilibrated in 10 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 20 mM NaCl, and 15 mM ME. A NaCl gradient of 0.1­0.5 M was then applied to the column. The isolated GTPase domains eluted at 0.15 M salt, and the GD2-KH construct eluted at 0.20 M salt. The G-4 motif TMDer mutant constructs were made by one-step PCR mutagenesis [26], with pETTmDer as the template. The N118D-, N300D-, and

Structure of a Double GTPase Protein 1657

N118D/N300D-substituted proteins were encoded by plasmids pETDG4I, pETDG4II, and pETDG4III, respectively. These three proteins were expressed and purified as described previously [9]. GTPase Assays GTP hydrolysis was measured as described previously [9]. Briefly, a 50 l reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10 M [ -32P]GTP, and the same molar ratios of each protein were incubated for 10 min at 70 C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 l of slurry containing 6% active charcoal. After 2 min at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged. Free inorganic phosphate levels were determined by scintillation counting of 70 l of the supernatant. Reactions were repeated at least twice, and average values with standard deviations are reported. Background hydrolysis determined in the absence of protein, approximately 9% of the wild-type activity, was subtracted from each measurement. Activities are reported relative to wild-type TM-Der that has an activity of 0.11 mol phosphate mol protein 1 min 1. Crystallization and Mutagenesis Crystals were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Equal volumes of protein and well solution were equilibrated against 1.3 M NaH2PO4, 0.7 M K2HPO4, 50 mM CAPS (pH 10.0), and 15 mM ME. Crystals belonged to space group P212121 ° and diffracted to 2.5 A. Phasing from these crystals proved difficult, and, therefore, five methionine substitutions were incorporated into the protein at Leu-156, Ile-284, Val-288, Val-345, and Ile-349 by onestep PCR mutagenesis, with pETTmDer as the template. Mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing, and the resulting plasmid, pRU520, was transformed into B834(DE3)pLysS. Selenomethionine protein was expressed and purified as described above. The SeMet protein was concentrated to 26 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained from 0.8 M NaH2PO4, 0.5 M K2HPO4, 50 mM CAPS (pH 10.0), and 15 mM ME, conditions similar to those of wild-type SeMetTM-Der. The mutated SeMet-TM-Der crystallized in space group ° ° ° P212121, with a 62.14 A, b 77.99 A, c 96.59 A, and 90 . The GTPase activity of the mutant protein is comparable to that of the wild-type protein. Data Collection, Processing, and Model Refinement Crystals were cryoprotected with 20% ethylene glycol, and a multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected at 100 K by inverse beam geometry from a single methionine-substituted TM-Der crystal at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X4A (Brookhaven, NY) with an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. Data were processed, integrated, and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK [27]. From the peak wavelength, positions of seven selenium atoms were determined by the SAD-phasing protocol implemented in CNS [28]. These seven sites correspond to the two endogenous and five engineered methionines. The initial methionine was most likely removed by N-terminal processing. Phasing and solvent flipping were also carried out with CNS, resulting in interpretable elec° tron density maps at 1.9 A resolution. An initial model containing 320 residues was generated with ARP/WARP [29]. The model was subjected to iterative cycles of model building in O [30] and positional and individual B factor refinement with CNS. Stereochemistry of the model was monitored after each refinement round with PROCHECK [31]. The final model contains 407 of the 439 residues in the protein and has an Rwork of 21.1% and an Rfree of 22.7%. Undefined regions of the structure include residues 24­37, 213­218, and 239­ 249. Statistics for the refinement are given in Table 1. Figures 1B, 3, 4, and 6 were generated with Ribbons [32]; Figures 1A and 5 were composed with Molscript [33] and Raster 3D [34].
