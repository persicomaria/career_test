AbstractöFibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and transforming growth factor K (TGFK) promote astroglial proliferation during brain development and reactive processes. The mitogenic potential of both growth factors is attenuated by increasing intracellular cAMP levels, an e¡ect currently assumed to depend on the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. In the present study, we sought to determine whether cAMP interferes with the mitogenic potential of FGF-2 and TGFK on astroglia by a¡ecting the expression of respective growth factor receptors. Treatment of highly enriched cultures of cortical astrocytes with dibutyryl cAMP accelerated the TGFK-induced internalization and subsequent functional inactivation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor by transiently inhibiting EGF receptor mRNA synthesis. In apparent contrast, both short- and long-term activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways robustly promoted the expression of FGF receptors 1 and 2, whereas expression levels of FGF receptor 3 remained una¡ected. Moreover, elevation of intracellular cAMP levels did not prevent translocation of FGF receptor 1 to the cell nucleus, a mechanism thought to be essential for FGF-2-induced cell proliferation. We propose that cAMP controls the mitogenic e¡ects of TGFK and FGF-2 on astroglial cells by distinctly di¡erent mechanisms. Whereas cAMP seems to interfere with the mitogenic e¡ects of TGFK on astroglial cells by a¡ecting both the expression level and signaling of the EGF receptor, the modulatory e¡ects of cAMP on FGF-2-induced astroglial proliferation seem to solely result from an inhibition of FGF receptor-activated signaling pathways. ß 2002 IBRO.

It is generally accepted that astroglia play a major role in promoting neuronal survival during brain development. Likewise, after brain injury neuronal cell death is limited by reactive gliosis, a process characterized by astroglial proliferation, hypertrophy, and the increased expression of the intermediate ¢lament protein, glial ¢brillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Ridet et al., 1997, for review). Over recent years, a large body of data has accumulated suggesting that during both brain development and reactive processes, glial proliferation is promoted by ¢broblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and transforming growth factor K (TGFK).

FGF-2 belongs to an ever growing family of growth factors, which comprises at least 23 members (Yamashita et al., 2000). Treatment of cultured postnatal astrocytes with FGF-2 results in enhanced cell proliferation and di¡erentiation (Perraud et al., 1988; Sensenbrenner et al., 1987; Hou et al., 1995; Reilly et al., 1998). Mice lacking the FGF-2 gene exhibit a smaller number of glia at maturity, an e¡ect probably due to a decline in the proportion of dividing cells (Vaccarino et al., 1999). Levels of FGF-2 locally increase during brain injury (Logan et al., 1992; Reilly and Kumari, 1996). Moreover, direct injection of FGF-2 into the uninjured or injured brain induces or potentiates reactive gliosis, respectively (Eclancher et al., 1990; 1996; Gomez-Pinilla et al., 1995). FGF-2 exerts its cellular e¡ects through a family of at least four high-a/nity receptors, termed FGF receptors (FGFR) 1^4, all of which possess an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Powers et al., 2000, for review). Besides the localization of FGFR1^4 to the plasma membrane, evidence of an intranuclear localization has been reported for FGFR1 (Maher, 1996; Stachowiak et al., 1996a,b), FGFR3 (Johnston et al., 1995; Zammit et al., 2001), and FGFR4 (Klingenberg et al., 2000). In the case of FGFR1, the receptor subtype most intensively studied to date, nuclear translocation of cell membrane-bound receptors occurs upon ligand-binding (Maher, 1996; Stachowiak et

al., 1996b; Clarke et al., 2001) or as shown for adrenal medulla cells also upon activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways (Stachowiak et al., 1996b). In addition, it has been suggested that FGFR1 can directly move to the nucleus without prior insertion into the cell membrane (Stachowiak et al., 1997a). Astroglial cells seem to express FGFR1, 2, and 3 (Balaci et al., 1994; Gonzales et al., 1995; Reilly et al., 1998; Miyake et al., 1996; Riva et al., 1998), which are all up-regulated in reactive astrocytes (Reilly and Kumari, 1996; Ballabriga et al., 1997; Messersmith et al., 2000). Although FGF-2 can principally induce cell proliferation through all known FGFR receptors in clonal cell lines (Ornitz et al., 1996), it is currently assumed that the mitogenic e¡ects of FGF-2 on astroglia are predominantly mediated by FGFR1 (Stachowiak et al., 1997b; Joy et al., 1997). TGFK is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors, which, like EGF, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin/SDGF, is a ligand for the EGF receptor (EGFR), also termed ErbB1 (Junier, 2000, for review). The other known ligands for the EGFR, betacellulin and epiregulin, have not yet been detected in the nervous system. All other EGF family members, including neuregulin 1^4, bind to ErbB4 and in part to ErbB3, the only EGFR family member lacking intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. ErbB2, the fourth member of the EGFR family, is an orphan receptor which, however, can modulate the activity of the other family members by heterodimerization (Klapper et al., 1999). TGFK and EGF act as potent mitogens and di¡erentiation factors for cultured astrocytes (Leutz and Schachner, 1981; Simpson et al., 1982; Casper et al., 1991; Engele, 1998; Zelenaia et al., 2000). In vivo, defective EGFRs lead to a reduced number of astrocytes or a delay in astrocytic development (Sibilia et al., 1998; Kornblum et al., 1998). Both TGFK and EGFR are up-regulated in reactive astrocytes (Nieto-Sampedro et al., 1988; Junier et al., 1991; Planas et al., 1998) and induce astrogliosis (Rabchevsky et al., 1998). Intriguingly, the mechanisms that control the mitogenic e¡ects of TGFK and FGF-2 during both brain development and reactive gliosis are currently not well de¢ned. In vitro, FGF-2-induced proliferation of astrocytes can be inhibited with TGFL1 (Flanders et al., 1993; Vergeli et al., 1995). In addition, FGF-induced astroglial proliferation is abolished by elevating intracellular cAMP levels (Kurino et al., 1996). Similar inhibitory e¡ects of cAMP have recently been observed by our laboratory for TGFK-induced astroglial proliferation (N. Bayatti and J. Engele, unpublished observations). In a further analysis of these inhibitory e¡ects, Kurino et al. (1996) revealed that cAMP can abolish the mitogenic e¡ects of FGF-2 by the rapid inhibition of the FGF-2activated Raf^MEK^extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade, a signaling pathway closely associated with receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent cell proliferation (Roovers and Assoian, 2000). In addition to interfering with growth factor-activated signaling pathways, it is well documented that the action of growth factors is profoundly modulated by changes in

the expression levels of respective receptors (see for example Burrows et al., 1997). In the present study, we sought to determine how elevated cAMP levels a¡ect FGFR and EGFR expression in astrocytes. Highly puri¢ed astroglial cultures were initiated from the postnatal cortex and maintained with the cell membrane permeable cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) or the respective ligand. E¡ects on EGFR and FGFR expression were determined by immunoblot analysis and competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The subcellular localization of FGFR1 was studied in membrane and nuclear fractions prepared from cultured astrocytes.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Glial cultures Highly enriched cortical astroglial cultures were initiated from postnatal day 1 rat pups (Sprague^Dawley; Charles River Wiga, Sulzfeld, Germany) according to a recently established protocol (Franke et al., 1998). In these cultures, 90^95% of all cells represent type-1 astrocytes; in addition the cultures contain few oligodendrocytes, type-2 astrocytes, and O-2A progenitors and are virtually free of neurons and microglial cells. In brief, cortical hemispheres were dissected under sterile conditions and incubated for 20 min in Ca2þ - and Mg2þ -free Dulbecco's phosphate-bu¡ered saline (PBS; Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) containing 0.1% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Trypsin action was terminated by transferring tissue pieces to Hank's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies). The tissue was gently dissociated by trituration through a plastic pipette. Cells were pelleted at 400Ug for 5 min and resuspended in minimum essential medium (Gibco BRL, USA) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Life Technologies). Cells were plated into 100-mm culture dishes (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany; cortices from three animals per dish) coated with poly-D-ornithine (0.1 mg/ ml; molecular weight 30^70 kDa; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Upon reaching con£uency, cultured cells were trypsinized and replated at a lower cell density. After the third passage, cells were further maintained for the indicated time with a modi¢ed serum-free N2 medium (Engele and Bohn, 1991) additionally supplemented with either FGF-2 (25 ng/ml; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), TGFK (50 ng/ml; PeproTech), dbcAMP (1034 M; Sigma), forskolin (1035 M; Tocris, Cooksan, USA), sodium butyrate (1034 M; Sigma) alone or a combination of these factors as speci¢ed in the text. E¡ects of FGF-2 and TGFK on cell proliferation were assessed in third passage glial cultures initiated at 5000 cells/ cm2 in 48-well cluster plates (Life Technologies). Cells were ¢xed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Toluidine Blue. Stained cell were counted at 160U within a diameter of the well corresponding to a total area of 5.9 mm2 . Cell fractioning Cultured cells were scraped o¡ in sucrose lysis bu¡er (250 mM sucrose, 5 mM Tris, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl £uoride (PMSF), 10 Wg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.3), transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and spun at 720Ug for 5 min at 4C. The pellet, representing the crude nuclear fraction, was sonicated in 200 Wl of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) lysis bu¡er (60 mM Tris^HCl, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose) additionally supplemented with PMSF (2 mM) and aprotinin (10 Wg/ml). The obtained supernatant was spun at 100 000Ug for 45 min and the resulting pellet, representing the membrane fraction, was resuspended in 40 Wl of SDS lysis bu¡er. Both crude nuclear and membrane fractions were denatured at 95C for 4 min and stored at 370C

Cortical astroglial cultures were maintained for the indicated time in the presence of dbcAMP (1034 M), TGFK (50 ng/ml), or a combination of both factors, and were subsequently analyzed for EGFR protein levels by immunoblotting (A, C) or EGFR mRNA expression levels by competitive RT-PCR (B, D). Immunoblot experiments were replicated at least three times. Protein loading was normalized to L-actin levels. Numbers indicate the relative changes of EGFR protein levels (mean þ S.E.M.; *P 6 0.001) in treated cultures as compared to untreated controls. RT-PCR analysis was performed with 30 cycles. With both EGFR and actin primers a linear increase in the amount of the reaction product was present between 24 and 32 PCR cycles (R2 v 0.98).

until use. The purity of the fractions was veri¢ed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against the glial glutamate transporter, glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) (1:4000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis Primers for FGFR1 and L-actin were designed using `Oligo' software and their speci¢city was veri¢ed by restriction digest analysis. EGFR primers were designed according to Shibutani et al. (1998). The sequence of the primers and the size of the expected reaction products are as followed: EGFR: sense, ATG CGA CCC TCA GGG ACT GCG AGA AC; antisense, GCC ATG TAG GCC ATG AGG TCC ACC AC (664 bp). FGFR1: sense, CAC AAG CGT GCC AAG AGC ATC; antisense, GGA GGC GTA CTC CAC AAT GAC (454 bp). Actin: sense, CTA CAA TGA GCT GCC TGT GGC; antisense, CAG GTC CAG ACG CAG GAT GGC (271 bp). Total RNA was isolated from primary glial cultures using the PeqGold isolation kit (Peqlab, Schwalbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA concentration was measured by

spectrophotometric absorbance at 260 nm. A total of 20 Wg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using 200 U per Wl of M-MLV (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 2 Wg random hexamer primers (Interactiva, Ulm, Germany). Target RNA (EGFR, FGFR1) was co-ampli¢ed with L-actin mRNA, as an internal reference, in a ¢nal volume of 50 Wl as described previously (Figiel and Engele, 2000). Ampli¢cation was carried out with 30 PCR cycles of 61C for 45 s. Reaction was performed with 20 pmol of primers for the target mRNA and 2 pmol of primers for the L-actin mRNA. The obtained reaction products were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel, and optical densities of the bands were determined by £uorescent image scanning. The ratio of optical densities was calculated and taken as a measure of the respective target mRNA. Immunoblot analysis Cultured glia were lysed by ultrasoni¢cation in 60 mM Tris^ HCl containing 2% SDS, 10% sucrose, 2 mM PMSF. In case of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) immunoblotting, the lysis bu¡er was additionally sup-

plemented with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. Obtained cell lysates were further diluted 1:1 in sample bu¡er (250 mM Tris^HCl, pH 6.8 containing 4% SDS, 10% glycerol and 2% L-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. Proteins (10 Wg/lane) were separated by SDS (10%)^polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting. Non-speci¢c binding sites were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 30 min and blots were then incubated overnight at 4C with one of the following antibodies: anti-EGFR (1:200), anti-FGFR1 (1:200), anti-FGFR2 (1:200), anti-FGFR3 (1:200; all from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-pCREB (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA; 1:500), anti-CREB (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; 1:500), anti-L-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; 1:1000). The immunoreaction was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Integrated optical densities of immunoreactive protein bands were measured using the Image Master VDS software (Amersham Pharmacia). Statistics Data were subjected to one way analysis of variance followed by pairwise multiple comparison procedures (Tukey's test). Differences with P 9 0.05 were considered signi¢cant.

RESULTS

Fig. 3. TGFK and dbcAMP-induced down-regulation of the EGFR is associated with its functional inactivation. Astroglial cultures were maintained for 24 h in N2 medium supplemented with TGFK (50 ng/ml) and dbcAMP (1034 M) and subsequently stimulated for 15 min with additional TGFK (50 ng/ml) or FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) without any prior medium change. To this end an aliquot of the TGFK and FGF-2 stock solution was directly pipetted into the culture medium without any prior medium change. Control cultures received identical volumes of PBS. Levels of pCREB were determined by immunoblot analysis using phospho-speci¢c CREB antibodies. Protein loading was controlled by additionally staining blots with non-phospho-speci¢c CREB antibodies. Combined pretreatment with TGFK and dbcAMP resulted in a complete inactivation of TGFK, but not FGF-2, signal transduction. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results.

Comparison of the mitogenic e¡ects of FGF-2 and TGFK on cortical glia Exposure of third passage cortical astroglia to FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) for 24 h resulted in a 2.1 þ 0.3-fold increase (n = 4; P 6 0.001) in cell numbers. In cultures maintained for 24 h with TGFK (50 ng/ml) a 1.8 þ 0.3-fold increase (P 6 0.001) in cell numbers was present. In the additional presence of dbcAMP (1034 M), cell numbers increased 1.2 þ 0.1-fold and 1.0 þ 0.2-fold with FGF-2 and TGFK, respectively. In cultures exposed for 72 h to FGF-2 or TGFK, a similar 2.4^2.9-fold (P 6 0.001) increase in total cell number was detectable. Again, this increase was abolished in the additional presence of dbcAMP. Independent of the treatment, 92 þ 4% of all cells in culture expressed immunoreactivity for the astrocytic marker, GFAP. Together these ¢ndings demonstrate that FGF-

2 and TGFK promote the proliferation of cultured cortical astrocytes with similar potencies and further con¢rm that the mitogenic potential of both growth factors is attenuated upon elevating intracellular cAMP levels (Bayatti and Engele, 2001). cAMP and ligand-dependent regulation of EGFR expression Immunoblot analysis of untreated cortical astroglial cultures using antibodies directed against the carboxyterminal of the EGFR allowed the detection of an immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular weight of 170 kDa (Fig. 1A, C). Treatment of astroglial cultures with dbcAMP (1034 M) for 24 h decreased EGFR protein levels (Figs. 1A and 2). Competitive RT-PCR analysis further revealed that this dbcAMP-dependent decrease in protein content is re£ected by a similar decrease in EGFR mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Exposure of cortical astroglia to TGFK (50 ng/ml) for 24 h also tended to decrease EGFR protein levels, whereas EGFR mRNA levels remained completely una¡ected (Fig. 1A, B). TGFK in combination with dbcAMP resulted in an almost complete depletion of EGFR protein levels after 24 h (Fig. 1A). This cooperative e¡ect was dose-dependent and required dbcAMP at concentrations of v 1035 M (Fig. 2). Maintaining cortical astroglia with dbcAMP for 72 h did neither a¡ect EGFR protein nor mRNA levels (Fig. 1C, D). TGFK for 72 h further reduced EGFR protein levels as compared to 24 h, but did not a¡ect the level of EGFR transcripts. Unlike in the case with short-term treatment, the e¡ects of TGFK and dbcAMP on EGFR levels were indistinguishable from those of TGFK alone after 72 h. In a

Cortical astroglial cultures were maintained for 24 h with a combination of TGFK (50 ng/ml) and varying concentrations of dbcAMP and analyzed for EGFR expression levels by immunoblot analysis. An almost complete depletion of EGFR was present with dbcAMP at v 1035 M. Protein loading was controlled by additionally staining blots for L-actin. Experiments were replicated three times with similar results.

manner similar to dbcAMP, forskolin (1035 M), which increases intracellular cAMP levels by promoting adenylate cyclase activity, enhanced TGFK-induced EGFR depletion after 24 h, whereas similar e¡ects were absent with sodium butyrate (1034 M, data not shown). This con¢rms that dbcAMP speci¢cally a¡ects EGFR expression levels via cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. Together these ¢ndings reveal that cAMP in cooperation with TGFK accelerates the ligand-induced depletion of EGFR from astroglia. To determine whether the depletion of EGFR immunoreactivity observed after the various treatments correlates with the functional inactivation of EGFR, astroglia were analyzed for growth factor-induced activation (phosphorylation) of CREB. pCREB was undetectable

in control cultures by immunoblot analysis using phospho-speci¢c antibodies (Fig. 3). Levels of pCREB robustly increased upon stimulation of the cultures with TGFK (50 ng/ml) for 15 min. This TGFK-induced activation of CREB was completely abolished in cultures previously maintained for 24 h with a combination of TGFK (50 ng/ml) and dbcAMP (1034 M). In contrast, a 24-h TGFK/dbcAMP pretreatment did not interfere with FGF-2-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Likewise, TGFK-induced CREB activation was unaffected by pretreatment with TGFK for 24 h (data not shown). These ¢ndings con¢rm that treatment of cortical astroglia with a combination of dbcAMP and TGFK results in the internalization and subsequent functional inactivation of EGFR.

cAMP and ligand-dependent regulation of FGFR expression Immunoblot analysis of cortical astroglia with speci¢c FGFR1 antibodies allowed the detection of an immunoreactive protein band with the apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa (Fig. 4A, C). Treatment of glial cultures for 24 h and 72 h with dbcAMP (1034 M) increased FGFR1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 4A, C and 5). FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) had no obvious e¡ects on FGFR-1 protein levels after 24 and 72 h. In cultures cotreated with FGF-2 and dbcAMP for 24 or 72 h FGFR1 protein levels were slightly higher than those in cultures treated with dbcAMP alone. Independent of the treatment, competitive RT-PCR analysis revealed no changes in FGFR1 mRNA levels after 24 h (Fig. 4B). After 72 h, FGFR1 transcript levels increased in the presence of dbcAMP (1034 M) whereas similar increases were absent with FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) (Fig. 4D). Cultures maintained for 72 h with a combination of dbcAMP and FGF-2 tended to contain higher levels of FGFR1 mRNA as compared to untreated controls, although this increase was not statistically signi¢cant. FGFR1 levels also increased with forskolin (1035 M; 72 h), but not by sodium butyrate (1034 M, 72 h), implying that like in the case with EGFR, dbcAMP speci¢cally a¡ects FGFR expression through cAMP-dependent signaling pathways (data not shown). Together these ¢ndings suggest that short-term activation of cAMP-dependent signaling primarily increases FGFR1 levels by a¡ecting translational processes whereas sustained activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways seems to a¡ect FGFR expression at both the transcriptional and translational level. In addition to FGFR1, astroglia seem to express FGFR2 and 3 (Reilly et al., 1998). In accordance with these ¢ndings, both FGFR subtypes were detectable by immunoblot analysis in control cultures of cortical astroglia. Exposure of the cultures to dbcAMP (1034 M) increased FGFR2 protein levels after 24 and 72 h, whereas at both time points FGFR3 levels were unaffected (Fig. 6). These ¢ndings further demonstrate that activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways in cortical astroglia leads to a net increase in FGFR expression.

Fig. 6. E¡ects of dbcAMP on FGFR2 and FGFR3 expression in cortical astroglia. Astroglial cultures were maintained for the indicated time with dbcAMP (1034 M) and analyzed for FGFR2 and FGFR3 expression levels by immunoblot analysis. The FGFR2 and FGFR3 antibodies labeled protein bands with apparent molecular weights of approximately 160 and 140 kDa, respectively. Numbers indicate the relative changes (mean þ S.E.M.; n = 3) of FGFR protein levels in treated cultures as compared to untreated controls. Activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways increased FGFR2 expression levels, but did not lead to detectable changes of FGFR3 expression. *P 6 0.004; **P 6 0.001; treatment vs. control.

E¡ects of cAMP on the subcellular localization of FGFR1 Previous studies indicated that the mitogenic e¡ects of FGF-2 require translocation of FGFR1 to the nucleus (Stachowiak et al., 1997a; Joy et al., 1997). To determine whether cAMP would interfere with the nuclear accumulation of FGFR1, membrane and crude nuclear fractions were prepared from cultured cortical astroglial cells and examined for FGFR1 protein levels by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 7A). Consistent with the basal proliferation of cultured astrocytes, FGFR1 immunoreactivity was detectable in both the nuclear and membrane fractions of control cultures. FGFR1 levels increased in the nuclear, but not in the membrane fraction, in the presence of dbcAMP (1034 M, 72 h). Treatment of the cultures with either FGF-2 alone (25 ng/ml; 72 h) or in combination with dbcAMP resulted in a decrease of FGFR1 levels within the membrane fraction and an increase within the nuclear fraction. Additional staining with antibodies against the glutamate transporter, GLT1, a cell membrane-associated protein (Duan et al., 1999), con¢rmed that the observed FGFR1 staining in the nuclear fraction was not due to a contamination with cell membranes (Fig. 7B). Together these ¢ndings reveal that cAMP does not inhibit the mitogenic e¡ects of FGF-2 on astrocytes by preventing nuclear accumulation of the FGFR1.

DISCUSSION

Fig. 5. Dose-dependency of the stimulatory e¡ects of dbcAMP on astroglial FGFR1 expression. Astroglial cultures were maintained for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of dbcAMP and FGFR1 levels were determined by immunoblot analysis. FGFR1 expression increased with dbcAMP at v 1036 M. Experiments were replicated three times with similar results.

FGF-2 and TGFK are potent glial mitogens, which a¡ect the growth of astroglial cells during both brain development and reactive gliosis. The mechanism(s) controlling the mitogenic potential of both growth factors are presently not well de¢ned. Previous studies demon-

Fig. 7. (A) Activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways in astroglia does not prevent nuclear accumulation of FGFR1. Crude nuclear (N) and membrane (M) fractions were prepared from astroglial cultures, maintained for 24 h with either dbcAMP (1034 M) and FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) alone or a combination of both factors, and FGFR1 levels were determined by immunoblot analysis. Note that dbcAMP increased FGFR1 levels in the nuclear fraction. Further note that FGF-2 alone or in combination with dbcAMP induced the translocation of FGFR1 from the cell membrane to the nucleus. (B) Analysis of the purity of the subcellular fractions. Membrane (M) and nuclear (N) fractions were separated by SDS^ gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subsequently stained with antibodies to GLT-1, a cell membrane-associated protein.

strated that FGF-2- and TGFK-induced glial proliferation are abolished after elevation of intracellular cAMP levels, an e¡ect currently thought to involve the cAMPdependent inhibition of the Raf^MEK^ERK signaling cascade (Kurino et al., 1996; Bayatti and Engele, 2001). In the present study, we have assessed the possibility that cAMP regulates the mitogenic potential of FGF-2 and TGFK on astroglia by interfering with the expression of the respective growth factor receptors. Increasing intracellular cAMP levels transiently inhibited EGFR synthesis and subsequently accelerated the ligandinduced depletion of EGFR from cultured cortical astrocytes. In contrast, high levels of intracellular cAMP robustly stimulated the expression of both FGFR1 and FGFR2 whereas FGFR3 expression was una¡ected. We conclude that cAMP controls the mitogenic e¡ects of TGFK and FGF-2 on astroglia by distinctly di¡erent mechanisms. TGFK binds to the EGFR, also known as ErbB1, a binding site shared in the nervous system with EGF and amphiregulin (Junier, 2000, for review). We observed that exposure of cortical astroglial cells to TGFK resulted in a gradual decline of EGFR protein levels after 24 h and an almost complete depletion of the receptor after 72 h. This loss in EGFR protein most likely results from the ligand-induced internalization of the EGFR and its subsequent lysosomal degradation (Sorkin

and Waters, 1993). In line with this view, we observed that EGFR mRNA levels remained unchanged in cultures maintained with TGFK, implying that TGFK does not decrease EGFR protein content in cortical astroglia by inhibiting its synthesis. Increasing intracellular cAMP levels by the cell membrane permeable cAMP analog, dbcAMP, transiently inhibited EGFR synthesis as evidenced by a decline of EGFR protein and transcript levels after 24 h, but not after 72 h. The reason why these inhibitory e¡ects only occur transiently remains to be established. In contrast to single treatments, the combined treatment with TGFK and dbcAMP resulted in an almost complete depletion of EGFR after 24 h. In the simplest case, this cooperative e¡ect re£ects the sum of cAMP-dependent inhibition of EGFR synthesis and TGFK-induced receptor internalization, although a more complex interaction can at present not be ruled out. Alternatively, EGFR internalization and, thus, receptor depletion could be induced by preventing EGFR^ErbB2 heterodimerization (Wang et al., 1999) or by enhancing receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Glenney et al., 1988; Sorkin et al., 1991, 1992). FGF-2 can principally a¡ect astroglial proliferation through FGFR1^3; all these FGFR subtypes are expressed by astroglia (Balaci et al., 1994; Gonzales et al., 1995; Reilly et al., 1998; Miyake et al., 1996; Riva et al., 1998) and are known to induce cell proliferation (Ornitz et al., 1996) in clonal cell lines. The FGFR subtype presently assumed to play a major role in the mitogenic e¡ects of FGF-2 on astroglia is the FGFR1 (Stachowiak et al., 1997b, for review). The regulation of FGFR expression in cortical astroglia by cAMP profoundly di¡ered from that seen for the EGFR. Both short- and long-term treatment of cortical astroglial cells with dbcAMP resulted in a net increase in cellular FGFR protein levels, as shown by robust increases in FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression and no changes of FGFR3 expression. The increases in FGFR1 protein levels were re£ected by an increase in FGFR1 mRNA levels after 72 h, but not after 24 h, suggesting that short-term activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways primarily a¡ects translation and/or the stability of FGFR1 mRNA or protein, whereas long-term activation promotes FGFR1 expression at both the transcriptional and translational level. In addition of being expressed at the cell membrane, active FGFR1s are also localized within the nucleus (Maher, 1996; Stachowiak et al., 1996a,b). Moreover, in several cell types, such as glial and endothelial cells, the nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 is closely associated with the induction of cell proliferation, implying that nuclear FGFR1 may play a pivotal role in controlling cell proliferation (Stachowiak et al., 1997a; Joy et al., 1997). Studying the subcellular localization of FGFR1 in astroglial cultures under the various treatments did not reveal any evidence that cAMP would modulate the mitogenic e¡ect of FGF-2 by interfering with the compartmentalization of FGFR1, e.g. by inhibiting its nuclear translocation. Activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways increased FGFR1 levels within the nucleus. This is consistent with the previous observation that newly synthesized FGFR1

is either transported to the cell membrane or the nucleus (Maher, 1996; Stachowiak et al., 1997a). The additional presence of FGF-2 resulted in a shift of FGFR1 from the cell membrane to the nucleus, an e¡ect most likely due the ligand-induced receptor internalization and its subsequent nuclear translocation (Maher, 1996; Stachowiak et al., 1996b; Clarke et al., 2001). Our present ¢ndings together with those from other reports (Kurino et al., 1996) suggest that cAMP di¡erentially controls TGFK and FGF-2-induced astroglial proliferation. In case of TGFK, these inhibitory e¡ects seem to result from (i) the direct interference with the activity of the RAF^MEK^ERK signaling cascade, and (ii), as revealed by our present studies, by the inhibition of EGFR expression. In contrast, the prime mechanism

by which cAMP controls FGF-2-dependent glial proliferation seems to consist in the direct inhibition ERK activity, as implied by the observation that activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways in astroglia promotes FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression. The better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the mitogenic e¡ects of FGF-2 and TGFK could help to promote neuronal regeneration after brain injury by in£uencing glial scar formation and to interfere with conditions of aberrant cell growth.
