Background: Oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation allows sequence-specific recognition of double helical DNA. This powerful approach has been used to inhibit gene transcription in LbitTo to mediate single and site specific cleavage of a human chromosome. Results: Using a combined NMR and molecular clynamics approach (including relaxation matrix refinement), we have determined the solution structure of an intramolecular purine,purine,pyrimidine (R,RY) DNA triplex containing guanines and thymines in the third strand to high resolution. Our studies define the GGC and T,AT base triple pairing alignments in the K,RY triplex and identik the structural discontinuities in the

third strand associated with the non-isomorphism of the base triples. The 5'.d(TpG)-3' base steps exhibit a pronounced increase in axial rise and reduction in helical twist, while the reverse is observed, to a lesser extent, at 5'.d( GpT)-3' steps. A third groove is fkmed between the purine-rich third strand and the pyrimidine strand. It is wider and deeper than the other two grooves. Conclusions: Our structure of the R,RY DNA triplex will be important in the design of oligonucleotide probes with enhanced specificity and affinity for targeting in the genome. The third groove presents a potential target for binding additional ligands. 1993,

Introduction Under certain conditions, homopurine sequences in double-stranded DNA can associate with an additional DNA strand, giving rise to a three-stranded helical strutture referred to as a DNA triplex [I]. The binding occurs in the major groove of the duplex and sequencespecific hydrogen bonds form predominantly between bases in the homopurine and third strands [2-51 (for reviews see [6,7]). Although such triple helices in nucleic acids were discovered over thirty years ago, their conformational features and energetics have only recently begun to be understood [ 2-131. In vitro studies have identified two structural motifs in DNA triplexes [ 1,2,6,10,11], distinguished chiefly by the orientation of the third strand. In purinepurine pyrimidine (R.RY) DNA triplexes or the purine mom tif studied here, a purine-rich third strand binds to the Watson-Crick (WC) purine strand of the DNA duplex in an antiparallel orientation at neutral pI-I. In contrast, pyrimidine,purine,pyrimidine (Y,RY) DNA triplexes or the pyrimidine motif, have a pyrimidinerich third strand parallel to the WC purine strand. Such structures are seen only at acidic pH [6,7], The two motifs also differ in the pairing alignments. In R,RY triplexes, guanines (G) and aclenines (A) in the third strand form reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds with guanines and adenines, respectively, in the WC purine strand, giving rise to G.GC and A,AT triples [ 11,14,15]. (In this notation, the third strand base is

written first, and the Hoogsteen interaction is shown by `.`.) Within the same motif, thymines (T) in the third strand can also recognize adenines in the WC purine strand to yield T,AT triples. In Y,RY triplexes, thymines and protonated cytosines CC+) in the third strand form Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds with adenines and guanines, respectively, in the purine strand, leading to T,AT and C + ,GC triples [6,7], Unlike the T,AT and C+ .GC triples in the pyrimidine motif, the G,GC, T,AT and A,AT triples in the purine motif are non-isomorphous (i.e. the relative positions adopted by the Cl' atoms in the third strand difer in all three cases) [7], so that any combination of two triples will perturb the triplex structure. These perturbations are expected to arise in regions where the sequence in the purine-rich third strand changes from one base to another, but have not in fact been localized to any particular structural feature(s). Several theoretical molecular modeling studies have tried to address this issue [16,17]. This family of triplexes presents an interesting S~LICtural problem and these structures may be important in promoter function and approaches to con trol gene expression (see Riological implications, below). We have therefore explored the structural features of prototypic intramolecular purine,purine. pyrimicline DNA triplexes by NMR in aqueous solution [14,18]. IIere we present the result:; from these NMK studies and the three-dimensional structures calculated from the data.

Results The sequence, folding topology and numbering scheme for the intramolecular purine.purine. pyrimidine (R.RY) DNA triplex chosen for our NMR studies are shown in schematic (1). The sequence consists of three segments connected by two loops and is designed so that the third strand segment must be antiparallel to the second strand, thus forming a R.RY triplex. We shall refer to the pyrimidine segment (residues l-7) as the first strand, the purine segment following it (residues 8-14) as the second strand, and the purine-rich segment at the 3' end (residues 15-21) as the third strand in the triplex. The thymine residues in the two loops are referred to as TL, numbered 1 to 10 in the order in which they appear in the sequence.

shows resonances in addition to those expected from the Watson-Crick (WC) duplex. A set of resonances arising from downlield shifted cytosine amino protons can also be detected around 9 ppm. These features are diagnostic of an R.RY triplex species [ 141 in which the third strand segment is bound in the major groove of the Watson-Crick duplex. We also detect some minor resonances (denoted by asterisks in Fig. 1) arising from the hairpin duplex with a dangling third strand which is in slow equilibrium (on the NMR timescale) with the triplex species. Further information on the pairing and stacking interactions in the triplex was obtained from a nuclear Overhauser effect (NOESY) spectrum recorded under the conditions given above. The region containing the imino proton resonances in this NOESY spectrum is plotted in Fig. 2. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) connectivities between imino protons in adjacent base pairs of the WC duplex segment can be traced sequentially from Tl through the G13, G12, T4, G10 and G9 imino protons to T7 (Fig. 2a). Imino protons of adjacent bases in the third strand show a similar network of connectivities from T15 through GIG, G17, T18, G19 and G20 imino protons to T21 (Fig. 2b), showing that the bases in the duplex and third strand regions of the molecule are in a `stacked-in' conformation. The imino protons of G9, GlO, G12 and G13 in the second strand show strong NOES to the amino protons of cytosines C6, C5, ~3 and C2, respectively, characteristic of Watson-Crick type pairing in these bases (Fig. 3a). The two amino protons were assigned by comparing the relative intensities of their respective NOE cross peaks with the guanine imino protons. These imino protons in addition show NOES of moderate intensity

The R,RY triplex shown in schematic (1) yields narrow, well-resolved resonances in the one-dimensional (1D) proton NMR spectrum both in Hz0 as well as in D20, indicative of a monomeric species. The 6.5-15 ppm rem gion of the ID lH NMR spectrum recorded in Hz0 at 1°C and pH6.2 is shown in Fig. 1. The imino protons that resonate at downfield positions are useful markers for monitoring base pairing interactions in nucleic acids. For this molecule, the hydrogen bonded imino proton region of the spectrum (12.0-15.0 ppm)

following a procedure analogous to that used for the cytidine amino protons. In the third strand, the thymine imino protons of T15 and T21, and presumably 7'18, display strong NOES to the adenine H8 and amino protons of A14, A8 and All in the second strand, respectively, indicating Hoogsteen-type interactions (Fig. 317). These observations are consistent with the formation of T,AT triples as shown in schematic (3).

NOES of weak to moderate intensity are also observed between the imino protons of each residue in the third strand and the H8, H2', 132" protons belonging to the residue preceding its Hoogsteen partner base (Figs 3b and 4). These NOES are detectable even at shorter mixing times and hence provide strong evidence in support of a reversed I Ioogsteeii-type interaction for the G.GC and T,AT triples depicted in schematics (2) and (3). These NOE patterns mimic the trends observed for a related sequence belonging to the same motif in our earlier studies [14].

The presence of strong NOES from the third strand guanine imino protons of Gl6, G17 and presumably G19 and G20 to the guanine H8 protons of G13, G12, GlO and G9, respectively, establish a Hoogsteen-type interaction for these bases (Fig. 31~). These results are consistent with the pairing interactions for G.GC triples depicted in schematic (2). The imino protons of Tl, `1'4 and T7 in the first strand show strong NOES to the adenine H2 as well as amino protons of A14, All and A8, respectively, establishing Watson-Crick pairing with the second strand (Fig. 3a). The amino protons in adenines were distinguished by

The K,KY triplex yields a reasonably well-dispersed spectrum in D20 at 15"C, pH 6.0, permitting resonance and cross peak assignments for nonexchangeable protons to be made exclusively from NOESY and total COP relation spectroscopy (TOCSY) data sets recorded with different mixing times [ 191. Some assignments were also confirmed by homonuclear and heteronuclear correlated spectroscopy (COSY) experiments. Sequencespecific assignments for most of the protons in tile triplex region of the molecule were obtained. The H5', H5" protons and a few H4' protons could not be unam biguously assigned due to extensive overlap, and some guanine amino protons were not assigned because of broadening beyond detection by chemical exchange.

Sequence-specific assignments were also obtained for five of the 10 loop thymine residues. The spins belonging to each of the remaining residues were identified but sequence-specific assignments were not possible because of a lack of sequential connectivities.
NOE and J coupling patterns first and second strands shown by protons in the

H2-TLl HI' cross peaks support this conclusion and, further, indicate a narrow minor groove width in these regions. Other sequential NOES in this region of the molecule, including those between the CIH3 or H5 protons and the sugar protons, are summarized in Fig. 4. Analysis of a homonuclear primitive exclusive (P.E.) COSY spectrum was confined mainly to the Hl'-H2', H2" regions because of severe overlap in the H3'-H2', H2" and H3'-H4' regions. The JHI,-.Hg and Jfrrl+y coupling constant values are reasonably good indicators of canonical C2-endo or C3'-endo sugar conformations [21]. For the resolved Hl'-H2' or IIl'-fI2" cross peaks belonging to residues in the duplex portion of the molecule, the measured coupling constant VdheS for the pyrimidine residues Tl, C2, T4, C5, ~6, and T7 were found to be in the range of 7Hz (digital resolution of the data set = 1,95Hz/point) for ' whereas for the purine residues, JHMI~ and JHGH.Z G9, GlO, All and G12, these values were in the range of 9Hz for JEIl~~Irg and 6-~Hz for JHI'LH~. In the absence of a complete set including the J~u'LH~, JH+Hz and JI~+HJ couplings, it is difficult to determine the pseudo-rotation phase angles for these residues [21].

In the NOESY spectmm for the Watson-Crick duplex portion of the molecule, intraresidue and sequential base to sugar I I1 `, H2', H2" and H3' NOE connectivities were readily observed from `I'1 to T7 in the first strand, and from A8 to Al4 in the second strand, despite some partial overlaps. The glycosidic torsion angles of all residues are in the anti domain since no strong cross peaks could be detected between the base and Ml' protons in the 40 ms NOESY spectrum [20]. Patterns consistent with a right-handed helical conformation are observed, including the presence of H6( i)-CH3 (i+ 1) and FIG(~)-H5(i+ 1) sequential cross peaks of moderate intensity in the C3-T4, C&T7 steps and C2ZC3, T4&C5, CS-C6 steps, respectively.

Fig. 4. A schematic depiction of the inter-residue NOES observed for the R,RY triplex (1) both in H,O and D,O. Only cross peaks that were resolved are shown. In contrast to other regions of the molecule, there are very few connectivities between the base and sugar orotons in the 5'-d(GoC)-3' and 5'-d(ToC)-3' steps in the third strand. The pattern of cross-strand NOES for the imino and methyl protons in the third strand is also shown. NOE third and J coupling strand patterns shown by protons in the

chemical shifts remained unperturbed, facilitating UI~ambiguous assignment for these protons. Patterns similar to those observed for the sequential NOE connectivities between the base and sugar Hl' protons in the third strand are also noticed in the region correlating the base and sugar H2', II2" protons in the same NOESY spectrum (Fig. 6). Strong intraresidue base to H2' and base to H2" cross peaks are detected for each of the bases in this strand, but sequential connectivities are weak throughout this segment (Figs 6a and Gb). At the contour level shown in Fig. ba, the sequential base to H2' connectivities are almost absent for the resolved peaks while in Fig. Gb, the sequential base to 112" connectivities are OIQT of moderate intensity. Note that the order of the H2', H2" proton bhemical shifts in guanine residues in the third strand are reversed (i.e. H2" of a given sugar resonates upheld relative to its corresponding H2') when cornpared with those usually observed in double-stranded DNA oligomers. The sequential NOES between GI6 H8 and H2', H2" protons of 1'15 appear as extremely weak peaks in the spectrum tihile the NOE between G13 H8 and 7'18 H2" is barely detectabie. The right-handed helical sense of the third strand is indicated by the pres ence of G20 H&T21 CHS and G17 H8-1'18 CH3 NOES. The cross strand NOES between the methyl protons

Expanded contour plots correlating the base and sugar Hl'/H3 proton regions of a 15Oms NOESY spectrum recorded for the triplex in DzO at 15"C, pH6.0 are shown in Fig. 5. In the absence of abnormal relaxation effects, an intra-residue NOE is expected between the base and the sugar IHl' protons, whatever the glycosidic torsion angle [ 191. In the third strand of the triplex, the intra-residue H6-Hl' cross peak can be detected for T15, but no NOE is seen between the Gl6 H8 and the T15 Hl' protons. The tracing resumes at the Gl6 H8-Hl' cross peak and continues until the T18 H&Hl' cross peak. The Gl9 H8-T18 Hl' cross peak is not detectable but the tracing resumes again at the G19 H%Hl' cross peak and proceeds normally to the end of the strand (Fig. 5). Most importantly, the introresidue cross peaks between the base and sugar HI ' protons for the residues in this strand are of moderate intensity in the 40ms NOESY spectrum, ruling out a SJVZ glycosidic torsion angle for these residues [ 201, The 1~1' protons of G16 and G19 (Table 1, Fig. 5) show strong upfield shifts and are observed in the H3' region. A proton-detected lH-% heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectrum confirmed these shifts, gjving cross peaks correlating these HI' proton resonances with the Cl' resonances. The Cl'

of Tl8 and the H8 proton of GlO (boxed peak, Fig. 6a) and between the proton pairs of T15 CHs and G13 H8, and T21 CH3 and TL5 H6 (Fig. 4), provide definitive evidence for the T,AT pairing alignment shown in schematic (3). Sequential NOES between the base and the sugar H3' protons are absent in the third strand except for the 5'.d(GpT)-3' steps. Intra-residue NOES between these protons are quite strong, though the base to 112' NOE cross peaks are stronger at 40 ms mixing time. The JHI~-fIg, JHIreHp coupling constant values for residues T15 and T18 are about 7Hz for both couplings from the P.E. COSY spectrum, again not typical of either the canonical CZen~o or C?`-end0 conformations (see below) [21]. By contrast, the JHI~~H~, JfIl,~ily couplings measured for the purine residues in this strand, including G17, G19 and G20, show patterns similar to those observed for the purine residues in the duplex.
Backbone phosphates in the third strand

H3', H4', H5', H5" resonances, only a few phosphorus resonances in the triplex could be unambiguously assigned. Five of the six phosphorus resonances in the third strand could be assigned from a lHdlP heteronuclear COSY spectrum (Fig. 7). The phosphorus resonances linking adjacent guanines in d(GpG) steps in the third strand are shifted downfield and resonate between - 2.3 and - 2.7 ppm, whereas those in d(GpT) steps are shifted to a much lesser extent (- 3.85 and - 4.21 ppm). By contrast, the phosphate linking T18 and G19 in a d(TpG) step resonates at -4.63 ppm. It has been suggested that the chemical shifts of the phosphorus resonances are sensitive to the phosphodiester torsion angles a and [ [22,23], and thus these downfield shifts may be due to unusual a and c angles (see below).

The lines trace the sequential connectivities between the base and sugar HI' protons in the third strand of the molecule. Dashed lines indicate breaks in the sequential connectivitles observed for the 5'.d(TpC)-3' steps. Notice the strong upfield shifts associated with the Cl6 and Cl9 HI' resonances.

tivities between the base and sugar protons extend to TLl in the first strand. In the second strand, a continuous network of sequential connectivities could be traced (starting from TL5) all the way up to TL7, indicating the presence of a lo-base helical stack consisting of seven purine residues and three loop thymines. The imino protons of TLl, TI.5 and TL6 show NOES to the imino protons of thymines in adjacent WC pairs, and to the H2 and amino protons of adenines in the same base pairs. By contrast, no NOE cont;lcts were observed between T15 in the third strand and its 5' flanking loop residue TLlO. Several inter-strand NOES both in Hz0 and in D20 were also observed between the bases located at the ends of the triplex segment and the loop residues TLl, TL5, TL6 and TLlO. The TL5 base and sugar protons show NOES to the imino and methyl protons of T21, similar to that shown by the purine residues in the second strand with the third strand protons (Fig. 4). NOES were also detected between the imino proton of TLlO and protons in the Tl.Al4 base pair. In addition, the Hl' protons of TLl and TL6 show NOES to the H2 protons of A8 and A14.
Structure calculations

The cross peaks in the NOESY data sets both in Hz0 and D,O solution were sufficiently dispersed to permit the quantitation of NMR data (see Materials and meth-

ads). The NOE intensities and cross relaxation rates for various proton pairs in the molecule were translated into distance bounds for the initial rounds of structure calculations [ 251. These experimentally-derived restraints were supplemented with hydrogen bonding restraints in the form of distance restraints between the donor and acceptor groups for base pairs in which the imino and amino protons were clearly implicated in hydrogen bonding by their respective chemical shifts and NOE patterns. A set of `repulsive' restraints between selected proton pairs were introduced for consistency with the NOESY data sets. No &torsional restraints were used in the calculations due to a redundancy in information and ambiguities involved in the interpretation of coupling constant values (see above). Also, no attempt was made to confine the backbone torsion angles to the ranges observed in crystal structures of canonical A- and B-form helices. The distribution of restraints used in the calculations is shown for each residue in Fig. 8a. The distribution of experimentally derived inter- and intra-residue restraints is shown in Fig. 8b. Six structures using three different seeds for initial velocity assignments were calculated via distance restrained molecular dynamics simulations from two different starting structures (see Materials and methods), The triplex region of the molecule together with the first and last residues in the two loops of

the sequence shown in schematic (1) were modeled. The structures converged to within 1.01 i 0.14 .& for the triplex region (residues l-21) with minimal r&dual NOE violations and distance deviations (Table 2) which are indicative of an internally consistent data set. Two structures from this ensemble, < DR-A > and < DR.13 > (one from both families of initial structures), were subjected to further relaxation matrix-based refinement. The structures were refined directly against 1038 NOE intensities from spectra recorded at mixing times of 40,90 and 150 ms in D,O [ 26,271. To avoid biasing the refinement towards strong peaks arising from short inter-proton distances, the I<1/6 factor was used to monitor the progress of the refinement as suggested by Keepers and James [ 281. The !$/6 factor is defined as R 116 = c lIobs `I6 ~ kT& 1'6/,c I,& 1'6 where k is the calibration factor and I,bs and I,,iC are the observed and calculated intensities and the summation extends through all NOES. The calibration factors calculated separately for all three spectra were essentially identical during the refinement for both structures indicating the high quality of the data sets. For the final structure with the lower RI,,6 factor <W-A>, the

back-calculated spectrum was found to be in excellent agreement with the experiment. Table 3 summarizes the deviations from ideal covalent geometry, the various R-factors and convergence statistics for the two final structures < W-A> and < RIv-B > and compares them with the initial structures Init-A and Init-B as well as with the distance refined structures <DR-A> and <DR-B > No average structure was calculated from the final 14 structures, to preserve their conformational heterogeneity. `1'0 assess the degree of conformational variability during the refinement, the coordinates from the final 3 ps of the molecular dynamics trajectories of both refinements were considered for structural analysis. During this phase of the refinements, the 1?1/6factor reached a plateau and wds similar to the (11/h values Of the final structures. A least squares all-atom superposition for the triplex region of these 14 structures and the final structure < Rh&B > over the final structure < RWA > is shown in Fig. 9. The average value and the range of RMSDs obtained for each residue in this superposition process is plotted in Fig. 8c. It is evident that the struchires are well defined except at the ends of the helix. Two of the loop thymines, in particular the residue preceeding T15 in the third strand, are poorly defined due to a lack of restraints, and this presumably affects the definition of

Structure analysis

The helicoidal parameters for all 16 structures were calculated using the program CURVES [29]. In the absence of standard conventions to describe helicoidal parameters for DNA triplexes, the parameters for the duplex and the third strand regions were calculated separately. The following discussion is restricted to the parameters calculated relative to the global helical axis of the duplex and the third strands of the molecule.

(b) Distribution of expertmentally quantitated restraints by residue. The intra-residue (n ) and inter-residue ( kej ) restraints are shown separately. Cc) Root mean square deviations (RMSDs) in the atomic coordinate positions calculated by residue, for the 14 structures and the final structure < RM-B >, relative to the final structure < RM-A > A least squares all-atom superposition of the triplex region of the molecule (residues I-21) was performed prior to the calculation. The average values are shown (open circles) along with the extreme values (bars).

The global helical axis calculated for the duplex region of the molecule is shown in two orthogonal views in Fig. lob. This axis serves as a good approximation, at least from a visual inspection, for the helical axis of the triplex. The rise and twist parameters relating adjacent base pairs in the duplex region of the 16 structures are shown in Figs lla and lib. The axial rise shows little variation along the helix, with an average value of 3.6K for all the steps in the 16 structures. In contrast, the helical twist shows some variation, especially in the C2.G13/C3.G12 and T4All/C5.G10 base pair steps. The reason for these variations is not clear. Averaging the helical twist for all the base pair steps in the 16 structures gave a value of 30". The x- and y-displacement values for each base pair in the duplex region of the molecule are plotted in Figs 1 Id and 1 le. The x-displacement gave values of - 5.3 A and ~ 0.7A in A- and B-form fiber diffraction models [ 291, with an average value of - 1.9A for all the base pairs in the 16 structures. Indeed, a small cavity can be observed in Fig. 10 when looking down the helical axis. The base pairs are clearly displaced from the helical axis, presumably to accommodate the third strand in the major groove, although some of this variation could also be sequence specific. We also notice a systematic variation in the x-displacement values for the base pairs along the helix. T.A base pairs in general seem less displaced from the helical axis than C.G base pairs. This trend correlates with the nature of the base (thymine or guanine) moiety in the third strand of the molecule. The y-displacement values for the base pairs show no pattern, and are constant, averaging 0.48A over the 16 structures. The axial rise and twist values in the third strand show a wide variation (Figs Ilc and llf, and Fig. 12). A sequence-specific, repeating pattern is observed for both parameters. The axial rise values for d(TpG) steps are large. Those for d(GpG) steps are intermediate, similar to those in the duplex region, and those for d(GpT) steps are small. These values appear to be inversely-correlated with the helical twist (Figs llc and llf), which is small in d(TpG) steps and increases progressively in the d(GpG) and d(GpT) steps. Thus, the non-isomorphism associated with the G,GC and T.AT

The glycosidic torsion angles are clearly defined by the NMR data for the third strand, Values were consistently low for the guanines, between -60" and -go", but ranged from - 90" to - 115" for the thymines, in all 16 structures. For the duplex region, values in the range - 115" to - 150" are observed for the nucleotides in the second strand shifting to between - 105" and - 140" for those in the first strand in the < Ri%A> and <KM-B> final structures. Sugar puckers for the duplex region of the molecule in the final two energy-minimized structures are found in the C.-endo, Cl'-exe or 04-endo ranges. In the third strand of these structures, the guanine residues adopt S-type sugar conformations ranging from ~1'~ exo to C3'-exe while in most cases the thymines adopt c4-eXO sugar conformations. Since it was not possible to extract all the relevant coupling constants, the pseudo-rotation phase angle parameters in our strut tures could not be verified independently [21,30,31]. Only improvements in methodology, such as the incorporation of time-averaging during the refinetnent protocol [31] could provide a more accurate pichlre of sugar puckers in DNA oligomers which, unlike RNA duplexes, exhibit structural polymorphism [32], We analyzed the [, M. torsion angles in our 16 stmctures for those dinucleotide steps in the third strand for which the phosphorus resonances were assigned. The c and CI torsion angles in the d(GpG) steps were found either in the c= truns, CI= -gauche domains or c = tram, a = - gauche/tram domains.

Space-filling models of the < RMA > structure of the R,RY triplex are shown perpendicular to the helix axis in Fig. 13. The three views focus on the dimensions of each of the three grooves formed by the three strands. To distinguish the three grooves, we propose to name the groove formed by the Watson-Crick strands the Watson-Crick groove, that formed by the second and the third strands the Crick-Hoogsteen groove, and the third the Watson-Hoogsteen groove. Of the three grooves, the Watson-Hoogsteen groove is the widest (13.5 A for the shortest inter-strand P-P distance), the Crick-Hoogsteen groove is the narrowest (S.3A for the shortest inter-strand P-P distance) and the Watsonxrick groove is intermediate (11.4A for the shortest inter-strand P-P distance) in the < R&-A> structure. The Watson-Hoogsteen groove is deep, and the Crick-Hoogsteen groove is shallow. The loop thymine residues in the 16 structures are not as well defined as the other regions of the molecule (Figs 8 and 9) IIowever, the nahlre of the pairing interactions are readily apparent and are determined solely by the NMR data without the inclusion of any explicit hydrogen bonding restraints. Residues TLl and TL5 in the loop connecting the two strands of the Watson-Crick duplex stack on the T7.A8 base pair and form two hydrogen bonds; TLl NH3 to TL5 02 arid TL5 NH3 to TLl 04. These interactions are identicdl to wobble pairing interactions. On the other hand, residues TL6 and TLlO in the loop connecting the set ond and third strands, stack on the Tl ,A14 base pair and form two hydrogen bonds; T1b NH3 to TLlO 02 and TLlO NH3 to TL6 02.

Unique dinucleotide steps and unusual chemical shifts

Discussion We have described the important structural features of a purine,purine.pyrimidine DNA triple helix containing guanines and thymines in the third strand segment, determined using NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with restrained molecular dynamics techfiiques. An NMR structure determination relies on obtaining sequence-specific resonance and cross peak assign ments for protons [ 191. High quality, reasonably dispersed NMR spectra were obtained for the triplex shown in schematic (1) (3 1 residues, molecular weight w 10 kDa) permitting assignments to be made by traditional 2D methods and subsequently quantitated for structure calculations. A DNA triplex can be regarded as a special case of DNA-ligand interactions. The

The sequence used in these studies can be construed as an overlapping tetranucleotide segment repeated once in tandem. A striking feature that is most obvious for the third strand is the conservation in the pattern of NOES and chemical shifts. Three unique dinucleotide steps are defined by the sequence in this strand, namely 5'.d(TpG)-3', 5'.cl(GpG)-3' and 5'.d(GpT)-3' steps. The sequential connectivities involving base and sugar protons are almost cotnpletely lost in the 5'.d(TpG)-3' steps and also appear perturbed for the other steps. Sequential connectivities are observed consistently only for the 5'-d(GpT)-3' steps (Fig. 4). From our calculated structures, it is clear that the notI-isomorphism associated with the G,GC and T,AT pairing alignments results in pronounced axial rise and reduced helical twist parameters in the 5'.d(TpG)-3' steps, and a dim

minished axial rise and enhanced helical twist for the 5'.d(GpT)-3' steps (Fig. 11). The chemical shifts are also distinct for the three steps (Table 1). The H2', H2" protons of the thymines in the 5'.d(TpG)-3' steps, and analogously the Hl' protons of the 5' guanines in the 5'.d(GpG)-3' steps, resonate upfield from their usual positions in canonical DNA duplexes. In our structures, these protons stack on the purine rings of the 3' linked guanines (Fig. 12) providing an explanation for these upfield shifts. The base H8 protons in the third strand resonate downfield from their usual positions in canonical DNA duplexes. It is likely that these downfield shifts arise from the poor stacking interactions in the third strand (Table 1, Fig. 12), although it is possible that other factors also contribute. Interestingly, several purine H8 protons in the second strand resonate at upfield positions relative to their canonical values in DNA duplexes (Table 1). Although other factors might be responsible for these shifts, it is notable that the stacking pattern exhibited by the second strand in our structures is somewhat similar to those observed for A-form helices. Theoretical calculations predict upfield shifts for the base H8 protons in A-form helices.
Clycosidic torsion angles and sugar puckers

(Fig. 6a). The intensity of the intra-residue base to Hl' NOES further substantiates our earlier observation of an anti glycosidic torsion angle for the residues in the third strand. In our structures, we find that these glycosidic torsion angles fall into two categories. The thymine residues exhibit glycosidic torsion angles similar to those seen in B-form helices (between - 90" and - 115"), while the guanine residues adopt glycosidic torsion angles that are in the high anti range (between - 60" and - SO">. In the calculated structures, the residues in all three strands adopt essentially S-type sugar puckers which fall into the CZ-endo, Cl'-exe and 04endo ranges. The sugar conformations adopted by the thymine residues in the third strand are notable exceptions, however, falling in the C4-exo range.
Helicoidal parameters

The glycosidic torsion angle adopted by the bases in the third strand of R.RY triplexes has been the subject of several theoretical calculations. The SJPZ glycosidic torsion angles are associated with Hoogsteen pairing, while anti glycosidic torsion angles are associated with reversed Hoogsteen pairing [ 16,171. Both features were made clear by our earlier NMR studies on a related sequence, showing reversed Hoogsteen pairing with anti glycosidic torsion angles [ 141. The present study expands on these observations. The detection of cross strand NOES involving the methyl protons of thymines in the third strand and the HS/H6 protons of the 5' neighboring base of the purine strand gives further evidence for the reversed Hoogsteen alignment

The duplex region of the R.RY triplex shows some trends that are also found in the Y.RY motif. Average values calculated from the 16 analyzed structures for the helical twist, axial rise and x-displacement of 30", 3.6 A and - 1.9A, respectively, compare favourably with values of 31", 3.4A and - 2.lij obtained for a pyrimidine,purine.pyrimidine (Y,RY) triplex that contains a central G.TA triple [ 131, This implies that the conformational changes induced by the binding of a third strand in the major groove of DNA triplexes is independent of the directionality of the third strand. This could account for the successful binding of contiguous homopurine sequences located on opposite strands by third strand probes that switch between the purine and pyrimidine triplex motifs [ 33,341. An interesting pattern is observed in the calculated xdisplacement values for base pairs in the duplex region of the R,RY triplex (Fig. 11). Somewhat higher values are obtained for GC base pairs opposite guanosine residues in the third strand than for A,T base pairs opposite thymine residues in the third strand. Thus there appears to be a direct correlation between the size of

the base in the third strand and the degree to which each base pair in the duplex is displaced towards the minor groove. The variation in the helical twist between base pairs in the duplex portion of the R.RY triplex is an unexpected feature (Fig. 11).
Phosphate backbone and groove dimensions

in several RNA molecules, including tRNA [39] and in the bulge loop of the HIV trans-activator response (TAR) sequence complexed to argininamide [40], and have been proposed to occur in the catalytic core of the Tetrahymena self-splicing intron [4 11. Triple helix formation via third strand purinerich or pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides is currently being used as a generalizable approach to sequence-specific recognition of double-stranded DNA. Using this strategy, a single site within 10 billion base pairs of chromosomal DNA has been recognized and cut specifically using third strand probes [42]. Such selectivity would have broad applicability, especially in the control of gene expression [ 10,35-371. The approach is being further generalized to encompass a wide range of target DNA sequences by using natural and synthetic base analogs in the third strand (reviewed in [7]) and by combining purine-rich and pyrimdine-rich segments in the third strand

While the 5'-d(GpG)-3' steps show rise and twist parameters similar to those observed for the duplex, the large 31~ downfield shifts at the internucleotide phosphates at these steps suggest 6, a torsions that are different from the - gauche, - gauche values observed for canonical A- and B-forms. In the calculated structures we observe c, a torsion angles in the -gauche, tram domain or tram, - gauche/tram domains for the two 5'.d(GpG)-3' steps. These observations provide evidence for structural perturbations occurring in the backbone of the third strand, somewhat unexpectedly in the 5'-d(GpG)-3' steps. The three grooves defined by the three strands show a progression in groove widths and depths. The width and depth of the three grooves decrease in the order: Watson-Hoogsteen > Watson-Crick > Crick-Hoogsteen (Fig. 13). The widths were measured from the shortest inter-strand P-P distances while the depth measurements followed from a visual inspection. The phosphate groups in all three strands are generally directed outwards. The third strand phosphates are somewhat inclined towards the second strand (see Fig. 13).
loop conformation

[33,34].
Unlike the pyrimidine motif, the purine motif of DNA triplexes can form at physiological pH, making it both more likely to be biologically important and also more suitable for the various applications mentioned. Our solution structure provides the first details at high resolution for this motif, and shows that the binding of the third strand displaces the base pairs in the duplex towards the minor groove, while unwinding the helix. Both guanines and thymines are readily accommodated in the third strand, resulting in non-isomorphic G.GC and T.AT triples. These differ in two helicoidal parameters, namely, the axial rise and helical twist in the third strand. In the d(TpG) steps, the axial rise is pronounced and the helical twist is reduced, while the reverse is observed, to a lesser extent, in the d(GpT) steps. The d(GpG) steps in the third strand exhibit intermediate values for these parameters, but seem to adopt unusual backbone conformations.

The structures of the thymines in the loop region are the least well defined of the molecule. However, from the nature of their stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions which are, in general, observed consistently in our calculated structures, it is clear that these residues enhance the overall stability of the molecule.

Biological implications Homopurine sequences have been observed in the promoter regions of several eukaryotic genes (see for example [6]). These sequences, when incorporated into plasmids, have been shown to adopt triple helical structures under conditions of superhelical stress, low pH or in the presence of divalent cations [6]. The formation of intermolecular triple helices involving these sequences inhibits transcription in vitro [ 10,35-371 and downregulates gene expression in uiuo [38] implying that triple helices may have an important biological role. Indeed, it has been proposed that endogenous RNA might regulate the expression of the c-myc gene via triple helix formation [lo]. Base triple pairing interactions also occur

The cross relaxation rate determined for the H5 and H6 proton pair of C5 wds used as the reference (disk tance = 2.45 A) in these calculations. The distances were given the following bounds: for dii <3.0& -0.2/+0.3& for 3.Op\ <dii (4.0% -0.3/+0.48, and for dji >4.0& -0.4/+0.5A. Distances to methyl protons were asslgned to a pseudo-atom at the geometrical center of these atoms and a 0.3w correction was added to the upper bound [ 521. 103 inter-proton disk tances involving imino protons were calculated from the NOESY spectrum (120ms mixing time) acquired in H,O. A few distances were calculated from the NOESY spectrum recorded with 160 ms mixing time. Because of the non-uniform excitation profile of the jump-and-return sequence, the intensities were normalized by multiplying with a factor [sin 0.19(& 5)] -1 for those imino protons that were more than 2 ppm from the center of maximum excitation. The T4 MS-All H2 cross peak was used as the reference (distance = 2.90A) for computing the distances. The bounds were set at + 10 % of the calculated distance. In addition, 64 hydrogen bonding distance restraints were incorporated to maintain base pairing. For each hydrogen bond, two distances which involved atoms in the acceptor and donor groups were restrained. Distances for the Watson-Crick pairs were taken from values observed in crystal structures [32] and assigned bounds of & 0.1 A while for the Hoogsteen pairs these distances were set to 2.85 & 0.2A and 1.85 i 0.2A between heavy atom donors and acceptors and between donor hydrogens and the acceptor atoms, respectively. During the course of the refinement 72 `repulsive' restraints were incorporated between selected proton pairs for which no NOE was detected at the longest mixing time. The lower bounds for these restraints were assigned 4.5 A.

linear gradient of O-40 % CH&N in 100 mM triethylammonium acetate, p1-I 6.8, detritylated upon treatment with 80 % acetic acid for 20 min, and chromatographed a second time under identical conditions. In the final step, the sample WaS desalted and COIIverted to the Lif form by sequential passage through SephadexG25 gel-filtration and Dowex cation-exchange columns (Aldrich Chemical Co.). Distilled, de-ionized water was used to elute the sample. NMR sample preparation and experimental conditions in 500 1.11 Approximately 800 &60nm units of the oligonucleotide volume (-5mM) was used for the NMR experiments. The experiments in 90 % H,O/lO % DzO (no added salt or buffer) were performed at pH 6.2 and 1°C. The sample for the experiments in DzO was extensively lyophilized and dissolved in 99.96 % D20 (Cambridge Isotopes Inc.). The experiments in D,O were conducted at pH 6.0 (uncorrected for the isotope effect) at temperatures of 1°C and 15°C.
NMR experiments Unless otherwise indicated, all NMR experiments were performed on Bruker AM 500 or AMX 500 spectrometers equipped with 5 mm probes at Columbia University. One dimensional II I NMR spectra in Hz0 were acquired using the `jump-and-return' sequence [43] with the carrier placed on the solvent resonance, with a spectral width of 11.1 kHz and a delay of 60 ps between the two 90" pulses for maximum excitation in the imino proton region of the spectrum. Phase-sensitive NOESY experimenis in the hypercomplex mode [ 44 J in Hz0 at mixing times of 120 and 160ms were acquired with 1024 complex data points in tz and 400 complex data points in tl. Hard, 70" preparation and mixing pulses were used in these experiments and the final detection pulse was replaced by the `jump-and-return' sequence for which the same experimental parameters described above were used.

NOESY spectra in D20 at mixing times of 40, 90 and 150ms were recorded sequentially without changing the experimental conditions on a Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer at Glaxo Rem search Institute. These data were acquired with 2048 complex data points in t2ancl 512 real data points in t, in the time proportional phase incrementation (TPPT) mode [45] with the spectral width set to 4.8 kHz. A repetition delay of 2.0 s was used and the residual solvent signal was suppressed by low-power continuous wave (CW) irradiation during this delay. Homonuclear TOCSY [46] and `clean-TOCSY experiments [47] were acquired with 512 tl increments in the l`PP1 mode at mixing times of 32 and 78 ms, respectively. A P.E. COSY experiment was recorded with 300 t1 increments in the hypercomplex mode exactly as described by Bax and Lerner [48]. A proton detected *H-&Z HMQC experiment [49] at natural abundance was conducted at 1°C with GARP decoupling [ 501 during acquisition. 960 t, increments were collected in the TPPI mode [45] with the sweep width along the `SC dimension set to 210ppm. A proton-detected lFIAIP heteronuclear correlation experiment [51] at 15°C was recorded in the hypercomplex mode 1441 with 1024 complex points in t2 and 160 complex points in tl. All data were processed on a VAX 6310 mainframe computer or on a SGI Indigo workstation using FTNMR or Felix software packages (Hare Research Inc.). All NOESY data sets used for data quantitation were apodized with 90" phase shifted sinebell window functions, Fourier transformed, and baseline corrected in the wz dimension. The cross peak volumes were integrated in Felix. Phase shifted skewed sinebell or sinebell squared window functions were used for processing the COSY and TOCSY data sets. The final processed matrix sizes were 1024 X 1024 or 2048 x 2048 in real points. All chemical shifts were referenced relative to external sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-si~dpentane~5~sulfonate (DSS; for `H,

For the refinement, only the triplex region plus the first and last nucleotides in each of the two loops were considered. The starting structures for the duplex portion of the molecule were constructed from the fiber diffraction coordinates for the A'and B-form DNA [ 53,541 using Insight II (Biosym Technologies Inc.). The third strand was constructed by docking individual nucleotides at hydrogen bonding positions from the purine set ond strand. The nucleotides belonged to the same family as their duplex counterparts. The atomic RMSD between the starting structures was 3.04A (2.78A for residues l-21). The structure refinements were carried out using X-PLOR [ 551 on SGI Crimson workstations. The starting structures were subjected to 300 steps of conjugate gradient minimization prior to restrained molec ular dynamics simulations. These calculations were carried out in a vacuum with reduced phosphate charges and a distancedependent dielectric with 1 fs time-step and employed cut-off distances of SA for computing non-bonding interactions and 5A for hydrogen bonding interactions. All distance restraints were introduced in the form of square-well potentials. A Maxwellian distribution of velocities was used for initial velocity assignments. Dynamics were initiated at 5 K and the temperature gradually raised to 4OOK in 1 ps following which, the system was equilibrated for 1 ps at this temperature. The force constants for the distance restraints were kept at 2 kcal mol- 1 A- 2 during these stages. They were subsequently scaled up to 100 kcal mol- 1A- 2 through successive multiplication by a factor of 1.5849 every 2 ps for 20 ps. The system was then gradually cooled to 300 K in 1 ps and equilibrated for 10 ps. The coordinates saved every 0.2 ps in

the last 4 ps were averaged and the resulting structure subjected to 200 steps of restrained minimization. Three different seeds for the initial velocity assignments were used for the two starting structures belonging to the A'- and B-DNA families in order to generate an ensemble of six distance-refined structures. The structure representative of this ensemble along with its counterpart from the other family calculated with the same seed were used as starting structures for relaxation matrix refinement. A total of 1038 NOE intensities (346 NOES per mixing time) were used for relaxation matrix refinement. The intensities for moderately intense, well-resolved peaks in the spectrum were assigned error values of f 10 %. The error values for the other peaks were assigned subjectively. For the calculation of the cZIlibration factor [ 261, only those peaks with less than 20 % error value were considered. The intensity restraints were entered as square-well potentials with the intensities scaled by an exponent n= l/6 [26]. < v-3 > - 11.3averaging was performed to fit NOES involving methyl protons. In order to speed up the refinement, a 4.5 w cut-off was employed for computing relaxation pathways [26] and the tolerence was set to 0.03A. A systematic grid search performed to determine an optimum correlation time for the molecule [ 261 yielded a value of 2.75 ns which was used subsequently for the refinement. Dynamics were initiated at 300K on the two minimized final structures from distance refinement. After equilibration for 2 ps, the force constant for the distance restraints calculated from NOE build-ups was reduced successively by a factor of 2.5 while concomitantly scaling up the weight of the intensity restraints by a factor of 1.5849 every 0.1 ps [27]. Starting with an initial value of 100 kcal mol-I, the weight for the intensity restraints was scaled up to 1000 kcal mol-I. The system was equilibrated for 4 ps at 300 K and the coordinates saved every 0.1 ps during the final 3 ps were averaged and subjected to 100 steps of restrained minimization.

To assess the conformational variability, structures at every 0.5 ps of the final 3 ps of the molecular dynamics trajectory were used for analysis in addition to the final minimized structures. The CURVES program [29] was used for calculating the helicoidal parameters. The GRASP program (A Nicholls, R Bharadwaj and B Honig, unpublished program) was used for visualizing the results graphically. The coordinates for the two final energy-minimized structures and the 14 structures taken for analysis from the restrained molecular dynamics trajectory have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Chemistry Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973, USA (acquisition numbers 134D, 135D and 136D) from which copies can be obtained.
