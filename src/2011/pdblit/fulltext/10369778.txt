It is regretted that Figures 7 and 9 of the above paper were printed in black and white. The correct ®gures and legends are given below. These ®gures appear correctly on IDEAL and JMB Online.

Figure 7. Ribbon diagram of B. stearothermophilus TRAP viewed along the 11-fold symmetry axis. Each subunit is shown in a different colour. L-Tryptophan molecules are shown as van der Waals models with carboxyl oxygen atoms in red and the amino group in blue. The Figure was generated by BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997; Kraulis, 1991).

Figure 9. Electrostatic surfaces of B. stearothermophilus TRAP (right) and B. subtilis TRAP (left) calculated with a probe sphere radius of Ê 1.4 A using program MOLVIEWER (M.J. Hartshorn, personal communication). The red color corresponds to negative charge and blue color corresponds to positive charge. The view is along the 11fold symmetry axis towards the Ltryptophan binding and putative RNA-binding surfaces.
