Crystal Structures of the Adenylate Sensor from Fission Yeast AMP-Activated Protein Kinase
Robert Townley1 and Lawrence Shapiro1,2,3* The 5-AMP (adenosine monophosphate)­activated protein kinase (AMPK) coordinates metabolic function with energy availability by responding to changes in intracellular ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and AMP concentrations. Here, we report crystal structures at 2.9 and 2.6 Å resolution for ATP- and AMP-bound forms of a core abg adenylate-binding domain from the fission yeast AMPK homolog. ATP and AMP bind competitively to a single site in the g subunit, with their respective phosphate groups positioned near function-impairing mutants. Unexpectedly, ATP binds without counterions, amplifying its electrostatic effects on a critical regulatory region where all three subunits converge.

activation is inhibited by ATP (1­3). Because cellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/ATP ratios remain nearly constant due to the equilibrium maintained by adenylate kinase, it is thought that AMPK activity in vivo depends primarily on the ATP/AMP ratio, the primary determinant of cellular energy charge (5). Lowered cellular energy charge can arise either from inhibition of ATP synthesis, for example, in hypoxia or starvation (5), or by increased ATP consumption, as occurs in skeletal muscle during exercise (6, 7). When energy charge is low, active AMPK inhibits numerous ATP-consuming pathways and also activates mobilization of intracellular energy stores to produce ATP. Conversely, when energy charge is high, AMPK inactivation is favored, leading to

MPK senses the onset of energy limitation and initiates adaptive responses, including regulation of key enzymes in each of the major branches of metabolism: fatty acid and sterol synthesis, sugar metabolism, protein synthesis, and

DNA replication (1­3). Long-term regulation by AMPK is controlled by phosphorylation of transcription factors and co-activators that regulate each of these metabolic functions (4). Mammalian AMPK is activated by binding to AMP, but this

enhancement of energy storage and use. AMPK also functions in organism-level energy homeostasis by responding to systemically circulating hormones, including leptin (8), adiponectin (9), and resistin (10). Canonical AMPKs are abg heterotrimers (1­3). Although gene fusions between the b and g subunits are found in some plant species, the overall domain architecture of the enzyme is conserved in all eukaryotes (11). In humans, multiple genes encode isoforms of each AMPK subunit (a1, a2, b1, b2, g1, g2, and g3) (1). The a subunit includes a typical serine-threonine kinase domain near the N terminus and a C-terminal regulatory domain characteristic of AMPKs. AMPK b subunits are required for trimer assembly and subcellular localization of the AMPK complex (12, 13). Many b isoforms include a glycogenbinding domain (GBD), for which structures are now known (14). The heart of AMPK regulation by adenylate binding is thought to reside in g subunits, which are composed of four repeated cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) domains (15­17). A number of CBS domain crystal structures have been determined (18­20), but only one recent structure included a bound ligand (21). Biochemical and genetic studies have produced an initial view of interactions among AMPK subunits (1) whereby b subunits play a central role in heterotrimer formation through interactions with both a and g subunits. Trimer interaction sites on both a and b subunits have been mapped to their respective C-terminal regions (22). Nonetheless, the precise molecular architecture of the AMPK heterotrimer has not been defined. We produced a trimer fragment from the AMPK genes of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which yielded two distinct crystal forms that diffract x-rays to 2.6 Å (for the AMP complex) and 2.9 Å (for the ATP complex) resolution. The trimer core consists of residues a440 to a576, b205 to b298, and the whole of the g subunit, g1 to g334 (Fig. 1). The structure omits two regions of the AMPK complex: the b subunit N-terminal GBD (14) and the N-terminal kinase domain of a, both of which have been characterized crystallographically (23, 24). Although the enzymology of S. pombe homologs has not been investigated, sequence conservation among AMPKs from different species suggests that the structures presented here will be representative for this protein class. We determined crystal structures by selenomethionine multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing (25) for both AMP- and ATP-bound crystal forms that each contained a dimer of trimers in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1 and table S1). The potential importance of this dimer of trimers is underscored by a human WolffParkinson-White syndrome mutation [human g2 Asn488Ile488 (N488I), corresponding to S. pombe gS247 (26)] that maps to the interface. Further, dimerization is consistent with the observation from Marmorstein and co-workers that mutants that disrupt kinase domain (KD) dimerization in vitro fail to disrupt sucrose nonfermenting 1 (SNF1) complex dimerization in vivo, suggesting association through other domains (23). Each AMPK trimer is roughly triangular, with a wide base formed by the g subunit, which associates with a tight ab complex that forms the narrower apical domain (Fig. 1, A and B). The a subunit C-terminal domain forms a compact, mixed ab domain (fig. S1) that is topologically related to the kinase-associated domains (KADs) of microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK) kinases (27). The b subunit C-terminal region lacks an independent hydrophobic core (fig. S2) and wraps wholly around the a KAD (Fig. 1, A and B, and fig. S4), forming extensive hydrophobic contacts. These features suggest an obligate nature for ab complexes.

binds through a set of protein ligands identical to those used by AMP, accommodating the b and g phosphates of ATP by adopting a compact helical structure for the triphosphate group (B). Electrostatic surfaces of the putative kinase-binding face, looking into the phosphate tunnel, show that the charge potential of the tunnel entrance is largely positive (blue) when AMP is bound [(D) and (E)] but negative (red) when ATP is bound [(F) and (G)].

The g subunit forms an elliptical disk with an aqueous pore in the center. An adenine nucleotide is bound at the interface between CBS domains 3 and 4, positioning the phosphate groups in the pore. CBS domains 1 and 2 form the interface with the ab complex (Fig. 1, A and B, and fig. S5). The g interface to ab is mediated primarily by interaction of a two-stranded b sheet from the b subunit, which hydrogen bonds with the b1 strand of g to form a three-stranded intersubunit b sheet (Fig. 1 and fig. S5). This result disagrees with a recent mutagenesis study that concluded that there is no direct binding between b and g (28). In contrast to the ab complex, very few hydrophobic interactions are formed between b and g, with this interface formed mainly through hydrogen bonding and salt bridge interactions, suggesting that bg association may not be obligatory. The g subunit structures reported here provide initial views of CBS domains binding their regulatory ligands. A single molecule of either ATP or AMP binds at the same site, between b strands 6 and 7 of CBS3 and b strands 9 and 10 of CBS4 (Fig. 2). ATP and AMP bind in nearly identical conformations and use the same set of ligating residues. In addition to these structural elements from CBS3 and CBS4, CBS2 also contributes critical interactions important for binding the nucleotide phosphates. Remarkably, outside the localized nucleotide binding regions, no substantial structural changes attributable to bound nucleotide are observed among these four independent trimers (fig. S6). In both ATP- and AMP-bound structures, a hydrophobic cleft formed from the side chains from CBS3 (gI216 and gP220) (26) and CBS4 (gI303 and gF292) sandwich the adenine ring. The N2 ring nitrogen hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl groups of gA196 and gA218. The ribose moiety is bound in a polar pocket in CBS4, in which the ribose 2 and 3 hydroxyls are hydrogen bonded to side chain atoms of gT191, gD308, and gS305. In the AMP complex structure (Fig. 2A), the terminal AMP a-phosphate forms salt bridges with the side chain of the conserved residue gR290 in CBS4 and two residues in CBS2, gR139 and gR141. Excellent electron density is observed for all AMP atoms in the complex structure (fig. S7). The ATP phosphates are ligated by an identical set of arginine side chains (Fig. 2, B and C); however, gR290 ligates the terminal gphosphate, and gR139 and gR141 have poor density and appear to adopt multiple conformations in coordinating the a- and b phosphates. In AMPK, unlike the vast majority of ATPbound protein structures, no electron density for metal counterions is observed bound to ATP. To confirm this observation, we performed experiments with crystals grown in the presence of 2 mM GdCl3. The Gd3+ lanthanide ion is known to effectively substitute for Mg2+ in ATP substructures (29) and provides a large anomalous signal for crystallographic experiments. Anomalous difference maps revealed no bound ions (fig. S7). These observations suggest that ATP-bound metal counterions must be stripped before binding to AMPK, where charge balance is provided mainly by the side chains of arginine residues. This agrees with the prior observation from Hardie and co-workers that Mg2+ is not required for ATP binding by purified g subunits (16). Our structural findings are in agreement with the reported relative binding affinities of AMP (~100 mM) and ATP (~400 mM) for a protein encoding fragments of the CBS3 and CBS4 domains of the human g2 subunit (16). However, the apparent absence of regulation by AMP of S. cerevisiae AMPK activity (30, 31) raises the possibility that nucleotide-dependent regulation of S. pombe AMPK may differ from that of the human enzyme. Cellular ATP concentrations are higher than AMP concentrations, often by an order of magnitude. Even when ATP concentrations fall, leading to AMPK activation, ATP concentrations generally remain higher than AMP. Thus, tighter binding to AMP is a functional requirement for AMPK. The structures presented suggest how AMPK binds ATP more weakly than AMP. This appears to be accomplished, at least in part, through the necessity for stripping ATP of shielding ions for binding to the adenylate sensor. Further, the adenylate binding site is better able to accommodate the smaller AMP ligand: The a phosphate of AMP and the g phosphate of ATP are coordinated by the same Arg side chains, and the positions of the two terminal phosphates are nearly the same (Fig. 2 and fig. S6). The overall orientation of nucleotide binding, for both AMP and ATP, situates the nucleotide phosphates toward an internal cavity that we refer to as the phosphate tunnel, which spans the breadth of the g subunit disk (Fig. 1B). In both ATP- and AMP-bound forms, the surface-exposed nucleo-

surface of this tunnel, positioned between the terminal phosphate of the bound nucleotide and the putative kinase-binding face. Two orthogonal views are shown. SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org

tide groups include parts of the adenine ring and the phosphate-distal face of the ribose moiety. These surface-exposed groups are identical in both AMP- and ATP-bound structures, suggesting that the nucleotide-binding face of the AMPK regulatory trimer is unlikely to function as the site of activation modulated by adenylate binding. The primary differences between AMP- and ATPbound forms of the heterotrimer lie within the phosphate tunnel. One substantial difference between the ATP and AMP complexes is in the surface electrostatic potentials at the distal exit of the phosphate tunnel, the putative kinase-interaction face (Fig. 2, D to G). This suggests the possibility that the different effects of these ligands might arise from the charge difference between the mono- and triphosphate groups of AMP and ATP. Prior studies have identified a number of mutations within the regulatory heterotrimer that lead to impaired function of AMPK, primarily in the g subunit (1). These mutations include an insertion in helix E at position g91 (32), and a point mutation at gS247 (N488I in human g2) (33), which is found within the dimer-of-trimers interface region. However, the large majority of functionally important mutations, which include changes to residues gR290 (human g2 R531) (34), gR141 (human g2 H383) (32), gV56 (human g2 R302) (35), and gT162 (human g2 T400N) (33), are all found lining the interior surface of the phosphate tunnel (Fig. 3, A and B). Residues gR290 and gR141 coordinate nucleotide phosphates; however, the other mutations, relative to the bound nucleotide phosphate groups, are positioned further toward the protein surface opposite to the nucleotide binding face. This face of the molecule, where a, b, and g subunits meet, may constitute a region for KD interaction, and we thus refer to it as the putative kinase domain interaction face (Figs. 1B and 3). The phosphate tunnel traverses the g subunit, defining a large void that is capped on the KDbinding face by a polar loop from the b subunit. We refer to this loop, which includes residues 244 to 255, as the b flap. The region of the b flap that covers the phosphate tunnel includes only polar and charged residues and makes no contacts to the hydrophobic core, suggesting the possibility for structural rearrangement. The b flap appears to be highly mobile (average B factors of 84.3 Å2 in the four independent b subunits, as compared with an overall average B factor of 51.6 Å2 for all protein atoms) and adopts slightly different conformations in the four independent copies of the structures presented here. The majority of g-subunit mutations that affect AMPK activation are positioned within the phosphate tunnel, between the terminal phosphate of bound AXP and the b flap. Because the difference between the inhibitory (ATP) and activating (AMP) ligands is in the number of phosphates placed within the tunnel and because mutants that affect kinase activation also lie within this tunnel, it appears likely that this represents a critical regulatory region. We have presented crystal structures that define the core heterotrimeric architecture for AMPKs. The S. pombe AMPK binds either AMP or ATP at a single site, suggesting that activating ligands such as AMP are likely to function by displacing the inhibitory ligand ATP. Nonetheless, possible binding of additional regulatory nucleotides in the context of nucleotide mixtures or the holoenzyme complex cannot be excluded. Although a detailed understanding of the mechanism of AMPK regulation will require structures of the holoenzyme, the structures presented here should provide an entry point for the rational design of AMPK-directed therapeutics.

Structure of Nup58/45 Suggests Flexible Nuclear Pore Diameter by Intermolecular Sliding
Ivo Melcák, André Hoelz,* Günter Blobel*  The nucleoporins Nup58 and Nup45 are part of the central transport channel of the nuclear pore complex, which is thought to have a flexible diameter. In the crystal structure of an a-helical region of mammalian Nup58/45, we identified distinct tetramers, each consisting of two antiparallel hairpin dimers. The intradimeric interface is hydrophobic, whereas dimer-dimer association occurs through large hydrophilic residues. These residues are laterally displaced in various tetramer conformations, which suggests an intermolecular sliding by 11 angstroms. We propose that circumferential sliding plays a role in adjusting the diameter of the central transport channel. he nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates the selective exchange of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The NPC is a ringlike structure with an eight-fold symmetry. A central channel is embraced by rings and spokes that are attached to the pore membrane domain of the nuclear envelope (1, 2). Composed of a set of proteins termed nucleoporins (nups), the NPC is one of the largest supramolecular as-
