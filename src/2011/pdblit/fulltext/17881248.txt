Abstract Here, we report the crystallographic study of a lectin from Canavalia maritima seeds (ConM) and its relaxant activity on vascular smooth muscle, to provide new insights into the understanding of structure/function relationships of this class of proteins. ConM was crystallized and its structure determined by standard molecular replacement techniques. The amino acid residues, previously suggested incorrectly by manual sequencing, have now been determined as I17, I53, S129, S134, G144, S164, P165, S187, V190, S169, T196, and S202. Analysis of the structure indicated a dimer in the asymmetric unit, two metal binding sites per monomer, and loops involved in the molecular oligomerization. These confer 98% similarity between ConM and other previously described lectins, derived from Canavalia ensiformis and Canavalia brasiliensis. Our functional data indicate that ConM exerts a concentration-dependent relaxant action on isolated aortic rings that probably occurs via an interaction with a speciWc lectin-binding site on the endothelium, resulting in a release of nitric oxide.  2005 Elsevier Inc.

teins of non-immune origin (Van Damme et al., 1998). Legume lectins represent the largest and most thoroughly studied family of protein of this class (Sharon and Lis, 2003). Concanavalin A (ConA), isolated from seeds of Canavalia ensiformis, a member of Diocleinae subtribe, is the most well-studied lectin in terms of carbohydrate binding speciWcities, metal ion properties and three-dimensional structure (Lee et al., 2000). Leguminous lectins have been considered as a model system for studying the molecular basis of protein­carbohydrate interactions (Loris et al., 2004), with those from the Diocleinae subtribe

showing signiWcant diVerences in potency with respect to many biological activities, making this an excellent model group to study structure/function relationships (Cavada et al., 2001; Moreno et al., 2004). The leguminous seed lectins show a remarkable conservation in primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. Indeed, approximately 85% of each legume lectin sequence is devoted to structurally conserved regions (Imberty et al., 1994). Comparisons of these sequences and structures have established that diVerences in carbohydrate speciWcity appear to be primarily due to diVerences in amino acid residues residing in loops adjacent to the carbohydrate-binding site (Hamelryck et al., 2000; Loris et al., 1998; Sharma and Surolia, 1997; Young and Oomen, 1992). The conformation of these loops is determined by the presence of calcium and transition metal ions in the protein structure (Bouckaert et al., 1995, 2000; Lescar et al., 2002; Loris et al., 1998), whose absence results in local unfolding and loss of carbohydrate-binding capacity (Loris et al., 2004). The deWning feature of all lectins is their carbohydrate-binding activity, and the preservation of this activity during evolution suggests that it is essential for the functional roles of these proteins (Etzler, 1998). Lectins from the Diocleinae subtribe Canavalia, Dioclea, and Cratylia demonstrate a high degree of structural similarity. Among the lectins isolated from the Diocleinae subtribe, only those puriWed from the seeds of Canavalia ensiformis (ConA), Canavalia brasiliensis (ConBr), Dioclea grandiXora (Dgra), Dioclea guianensis (Dguia), and Cratylia mollis (Cra) have had their three-dimensional structures resolved by X-ray crystallography. The majority of the lectins from the Diocleinae subtribe present orthorhombic crystals belonging to diverse space groups (Moreno et al., 2004). They are dimeric or tetrameric structures built from dome-shaped monomers consisting of jolly roll motifs interconnected by turns and loops (Calvete et al., 1999). Concanavalin M (ConM) is a 25.5 kDa seed lectin with 237 residues per monomer. Like other legume lectins, ConM possesses a very similar amino acid sequence to ConA, reaching up to 90% similarity (Perez et al., 1991). However, despite being highly structurally analogous, these lectins express very diverse biological activities, such as induction of rat paw oedema (Bento et al., 1993), peritoneal macrophage migration in mice (Rodriguez et al., 1992), pro- and anti-inXammatory eVects (Alencar et al., 1999; Assreuy et al., 1999; Bento et al., 1993), histamine release (Ferreira et al., 1996; Gomes et al., 1994), apoptosis (Barbosa et al., 2001), NO production (Andrade et al., 1999), renal eVects (Havt et al., 2003), mitogenicity (Barral-Netto et al., 1992), and cytokine production in vitro and in vivo (Cavada et al., 2001). Lectins that are known to recognize endothelial cell adhesion molecules have been shown to release endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) (EDRF) from blood vessels (Kleha et al., 1991, 1995). In pre-contracted rabbit aorta with an intact endothelium, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) produced a full endothelium-dependent relaxation, whilst

the eVects of Con A were only partially endotheliumdependent. Under physiological conditions, when all factors and mediators are correctly balanced, activity of the endothelium favors vasodilatation. However, there is a shift in dysfunctional endothelium toward vasoconstriction, since endothelial cell damage may result in an inability to synthesize vasodilator factors such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) (Nomi et al., 2002). Endothelial dysfunction is now recognized as an important process in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (Laufs, 2003), with impaired endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation, via inhibition of NO synthesis, occurring at an early stage of the disease (Cooke and Dzau, 1997). Thus, endotheliumderived NO, an important regulator of cardiovascular homoeostasis through its vasodilator, growth regulatory and anti-thrombotic activities (Ignarro et al., 1999) plays a signiWcant role in the progression of atherosclerosis (Landmesser et al., 2000), and may also determine the anti-atherosclerotic properties of the endothelium (Bult et al., 1999). Studies of biological activity have revealed marked diVerences amongst lectins isolated from seeds of the Diocleinae species (Barral-Netto et al., 1992). For example, strong diVerences in potency and eYcacy are apparent regarding their ability to release histamine, despite a very high homology (80­90%) with respect to their primary structures. DiVerences between them have also been observed with respect to human lymphocyte stimulation and -interferon production by human peripheral mononuclear cells (Barral-Netto et al., 1992). As part of our continuing studies of the Diocleinae lectins, we now report the crystal structure of native ConM and its NO-dependent activity on vascular smooth muscle. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Crystallization and data collection Canavalia maritima lectin (ConM) was puriWed as described by MOreira and Cavada (1984) to C. brasiliensis (ConBr) and diluted homogeneously to a concentration of 40.0 mg mL¡1 in 1 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.0, containing 5 mM CaCl2, and MnCl2 for all crystallization experiments. Crystallization conditions for ConM were screened using the hanging-drop vapour-diVusion method with Hampton Research Crystal Screens I and II (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA, USA; Jancarik and Kim, 1991) at room temperature (293 K). Microcrystals were obtained using crystallization condition No. 39 of screen I (0.1 M Hepes­ Na, pH 7.5, 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, and 2% v/v polyethylene glycol 400). Improvement of this crystallization condition was obtained by raising the pH and the precipitant concentration. The best crystals were obtained from drops containing equal volumes (2 l) of protein solution and 0.1 M Hepes buVer, pH 8.43, with 2 M ammonium sulfate, and 4% PEG 400 solution. The reservoir contained 400 l of solution. Crystals grew within a week to maximum

dimensions of approximately 0.8 £ 0.4 £ 0.4 mm. X-ray data were collected from a single crystal cooled to a temperature of 100 K. To avoid ice formation, crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 75% of 0.1 M Hepes buVer, pH 8.43, with 2 M ammonium sulphate and 4% PEG 400, and 25% glycerol and submitted to data collection at a wavelength of 1.4270 Å using a synchrotron-radiation source (CPr station, Laboratorio Nacional de Luz Sincrotron-LNLS, Campinas, Brazil). A complete data set was obtained using a CCD (MAR Research) in 120 frames with an oscillation range of 1°. The data set was indexed, integrated and scaled at 1.95 Å using MOSFLM and SCALA (Collaborative Computacional Project, Number 4, 1994). Crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212. The calculated Matthews coeYcient (Mathews, 1968) indicated a dimer in the asymmetric unit. 2.2. Molecular replacement and reWnement The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement using the C. ensiformis lectin (ConA) structure without complexed sugar and water molecules (PDB code 3ENR) (Bouckaert et al., 2000) as a search model. After rotation and translation functions calculation, the best results indicated a correlation coeYcient of 65.2% and an Rfactor of 53.2% using the MolRep program (Vargin and Teplyakov, 1997). The initial structure was submitted to a rigid body and restrained reWnement using REFMAC5 (Collaborative Computacional Project, Number 4, 1994) and Rfactor and Rfree converged to 23.38 and 27.36%, respectively. The G58, G70, V129, D192, and S202 residues were replaced, the side chain conformations roughly adjusted to satisfy the electron density map, and certain other residues of the amino acid sequence changed based on electronic density. A total of 259 water molecules were added with XtalView (McRee, 1999) to the model, and a second restrained reWnement was performed resulting in a Rfactor of 18.91%, and a Rfree of 23.69%. 2.3. Evaluation of ConM-induced endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation Institutional Ethical Committee Approval (Universidade Estadual do Ceará) for experimental protocols used in this study was obtained. Male Wistar rats (200­300 g) were killed by stunning and cervical dislocation. The thoracic aorta was quickly excised and placed in Tyrode solution (composition in mM: NaCl 136, KCl 5, NaHCO3 11.9, MgCl2 0.98, CaCl2 2, NaH2PO4 0.36, and glucose 5.5). Tissues were cleaned of connective tissue and cut into »3 mm rings. In certain experiments the endothelium was removed by mechanical rubbing of the intimal surface. To perform measurements of contractile responses, aortic rings were Wxed in an organ bath chamber, Wlled with 10 mL Tyrode solution, bubbled with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide and maintained at 37 °C. A resting tension of 2 g was applied and tissues left to equilibrate for 60 min. The active tension was developed isometrically using a force transducer,

connected to a computerized data acquisition system (Chart 4.2; PowerLab, ADInstruments). Presence of endothelium was determined by addition of acetylcholine (ACh, 1 M) to phenylephrine (PE, 0.1 M)-precontracted aortic rings. Tissues were considered to possess intact endothelium when the relaxant response to ACh was greater than 75% of induced tone. In the evaluation of ConM relaxant eVects on aorta rings, the lectin was added in cumulative concentrations (1­100 g/mL) into tissues, with or without endothelium, pre-contracted with phenylephrine (0.1 M). In the same fashion, ConA (1­100 g/mL) was administrated on nonand endothelized aortas to compare the responses. Additionally, the investigation of a possible involvement of the endothelium-derived relaxant factor NO was assessed using an established inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthase enzyme, L-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). 100 M LNAME was added to pre-contracted tissues with intact endothelium, before performing a cumulative concentration response to ConM. Data are presented as percentages of initial contraction expressed as mean § SEM of n experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using a Student's t test (paired or unpaired as appropriate) or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc Tukey multiple comparison test. Values were taken to be signiWcantly diVerent from controls when p < 0.05. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.

Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000) with PDB code 2CWM. The tetramer consisted of two canonical legume lectin dimers, with the monomeric polypeptide chain containing 237 residues. Data collection and reWnement statistics are presented in Table 1. Fig. 1 shows the alignment of primary sequences from lectins of the Diocleinae subtribe, and shows that ConM presents a high degree of similarity when compared with the other lectins from the same subtribe. The sequence suggested by Perez et al. (1991) showed 90% similarity with ConA, however, some residues were corrected in our present study by the diVerences between the amino acid sequence and the electron density, resulting in an increased similarity of 98%. The changed residues based on electron density were V17, S53, M129, T134, S144, P164, S165, G169, T187, T190, A196, and P202, which were substituted by I17, I53, V129, S134, G144, S164, S169, P165, V187, S190, T196, and S202, respectively. The changes of this amino acid sequence determined by electron density became the sequence calculated according to the analysis of Perez et al. (1991) for 14 of the 19 amino acid types (this protein does not present cysteine). Only Wve amino acid residues are diVerent between the ConA (D58, A70, M129, E192, and P202) and ConM (G58, G70, S129, D192, and S202) sequences. These diVerences represent some particular 3D alterations, although the relevance of these can be seen mainly in the substitution of P202 to S202 in the ConM structure (Fig. 2). This change causes conformational alterations in the carbohydrate-

binding site. The presence of a serine at position 202 moves H205 away and approximates the side chain of D203 to Y100, causing an interaction that moves L99 and Y100 together and opens the site about 0.70 Å in comparison with ConA (1GKB) and CGL (Canavalia gladiata lectin) (1WUG) (Table 2). Thus, the 13.70 Å distance between Y100 and R228 in ConM is suYcient to reduce the steric impediment caused by Y100 on Y12, which is bent over gently to inside of the site, thus reducing the distance to G227.

Two canonical dimers, associated by -strands in cross salt bridges, form the ConM quaternary structure. The ­ interface contacts and hydrogen bounds stabilize the canonical dimers interaction as shown in Fig. 3. Eight residues in the C1 and C2 sites interconnect them. The interaction in C1 is a cross-linkage between the Asp78 and Arg60 in chains A and D, and in chains B and C. Other interactions stabilize the structure at the Thr49 and Ser119 residues. These interactions are in the same line, as shown in Fig. 3B. The presence of the tetramer in the crystal indicates that association of ConM dimers is not sterically prohibited and can occur under suitable conditions. In this respect it would appear likely that there is a dynamic equilibrium between dimers and tetramers in solution. Indeed there are numerous examples of higher-order multimer formation in lectin crystal structures (Hamelryck et al., 2000) and in solution (Cho and Cummings, 1995). The ability of lectins to form

tetramers could therefore be physiologically relevant in the context of receptor cross-linking, which often occurs in signal transduction systems. This could allow for subtle regulation, based on the local concentration of the lectin on the cell surface, the local pH, and other factors (Buts et al., 2001). Previous ConA structures have shown some poorly dense regions at N-terminal residues and in surface loops at 118­122, 149­151, 160­163 residues (Bouckaert et al., 1999; Deacon et al., 1997; Naismith et al., 1994). The electron density of loops in ConM is weak or simply does not appear. Some structures deWned at atomic resolution do not show electron density in their loops, whereas other structures have better electron density than higher resolution structures, as can be seen in KantardjieV et al. (2002) at the exposed Ser161­Ser164 loop. This is caused by the existence of individual multi-conformer arrangements that do not create suYciently localized electron density to discern any deWned loop (KantardjieV et al., 2002). The absence of electron density in loop regions of ConM is common to many structures, including those of ConA, ConBr, Cra, and Dguia (Sanz-Aparicio et al., 1997). In native ConM, the amino acids involved in metal binding are conserved, and the structures of the Mn2+- and Ca2+-binding sites showed similarities with those

crystal contacts or have little contact with other parts of the protein. The former diVerences are probably real and the atoms involved have relatively low temperature factors.

3.3. Biological activities determined for other leguminous lectins. ConM monomers contain Mn2+ and Ca2+ ions in the vicinity of the carbohydrate-binding site (Fig. 4). The binding of the Ca2+ metal ion drives the trans-to-cis isomerisation of the Ala207­ Asp208 peptide bond, which is conserved in all known leguminous lectin crystal structures. This cis-peptide bond contributes to the stabilization of the binding pocket by orientating the positions of the Asn14 and Arg228 residues. Each of the metal ions is coordinated by four amino acid side chains and two water molecules: Glu8, Asp10, Asp19, and His24 with Mn2+; and Asp10, Tyr12, Asn14, and Asp19 with Ca2+. In the case of the Ca2+ ion, one of the water molecules forms a bridge between the metal and the main-chain carbonyl group of Asp208, thus stabilizing the unusual Ala207­Asp208 cis-peptide bond. As previously noted in ConA-like structures, the saccharide-binding site in ConM exhibits a negative electrostatic potential, as calculated by PyMol Molecular Graphics System (Fig. 5). Upon binding of the saccharide, this negative electrostatic surface becomes covered by neutrally charged saccharide (Hamodrakas et al., 1997). 3.2. Structure quality assessment In the Wnal model, 87.7% of the residues are in the most favored regions, 11.6% in the additionally allowed region, and the other 0.7% in the generously allowed region. The most signiWcant diVerences between the ConM structure and the ConA model are in the regions 119­122, 150­157, and 161­163. Structural diVerences between subunits occur primarily in the loops. These regions are either involved in Phenylephrine (0.1 M) induced stable tonic contractions of aortic rings in preparations possessing an intact endothelium of 0.58 § 0.1 g (n D 5; Figs. 6A and F) and of 1.07 § 0.09 g in those in which the endothelium had been mechanically removed (n D 6; Figs. 6B and F). Cumulative addition of ConM to precontracted tissues induced a signiWcant, concentration-dependent relaxation of preparations with intact endothelium, starting at 10 g/mL, with complete relaxation evident at 30 g/mL (IC50 of 9.8 § 0.6 g/mL; Figs. 6A and F). In contrast, no relaxant eVect of ConM was observed at concentrations 630 g/mL in endothelially denuded preparations (Figs. 6B and F). Thus, ConM-induced relaxation of phenylephrine-precontracted tissues was strictly dependent on the presence of intact endothelium. On the other hand, cumulative addition of ConA to pre-contracted tissues induced a signiWcant, concentration-dependent relaxation of preparations with preserved endothelium, starting at 10 g/mL (about 20% relaxation), with incomplete reversal at 100 g/mL (85%; IC50 of 26.18 § 5.7 g/mL; Figs. 6C and E). According to ConM, no relaxant eVect was observed in tissues in which the endothelium had been removed (data not shown). Furthermore, the relaxant eVect of ConM was totally blocked by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor LNAME (100 M; n D 5; Figs. 6D and F) in aortic rings possessing an intact endothelium, suggesting that the endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by ConM could be attributed to a release of NO from the endothelial cells. NO, the principal mediator of endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat aorta is produced from arginine and oxygen

by the endothelial isoform of NOS (eNOS) in response to agonists such as acetylcholine, bradykinin and substance P (Fleming and Busse, 1999). These agonists cause intracellular Ca2+ elevation and consequent activation of calmodulin (CaM) that stimulates eNOS. However, eNOS can also be activated by Ca2+-independent mechanisms, such as shear stress (Fleming et al., 1998; Venema, 2002). A general characteristic of NO-mediated events in blood vessels, however, is its inhibition by L-arginine analogues, such as L-NAME (Moncada et al., 1991; Tare et al., 2000). Since in the present study L-NAME blocked ConM-induced relaxation, it is likely that NO is being released by interaction of the exogenous lectin with carbohydrate domains present in endothelial cells. Previous evidence suggests that lectins may bind to vascular endothelial cells (Mills and Haworth, 1986; Simionescu et al., 1982), which may then result in release NO and lead to activation of smooth muscle guanylate cyclase and consequent vasorelaxation (Karaki et al., 1997; Moncada et al., 1991).

It has been demonstrated that wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and concanavalin A (ConA) release endotheliumderived relaxant factors from rabbit aorta (Kleha et al., 1991) and more recently, we have shown that Bryothamnion triquetrum algae lectin induces relaxation of rat aorta via release of NO (Lima et al., 2004). Cavada et al. (2001) hypothesised that lectins with binding speciWcity for the same ligands should possess similar biological eVects. The present crystallographic study of ConM shows a high quaternary structural similarity with ConA and 98% sequence similarity, with Wve diVerent amino acid residues being diVerent. However, not one of these is localized in a site other than the carbohydrate biding domain. The modiWcations caused by Ser202 increase the possible interactions with cell surface glycans, whilst the presence of Tyr12 at the carbohydrate binding site favors interactions with the reactive hydroxyl group and the internal sugar residues of a glycan. In an hemagglutination inhibition assay, ConA and

ConM showed diVerent carbohydrate speciWcities (Perez et al., 1991). Both these lectins promote endotheliumdependent relaxant eVects on aorta, however, ConM possesses a much higher potency than ConA (3 times), that contrasts with Kleha et al. (1991) (43 times). These diVerences may be the result of a direct eVect of the extended site present in ConM, however, species diVerences between our present study (rat) and those of Kleha et al. (rabbit; 1991, dog; 1995) may also play a role. Future investigation of the underlying mechanism(s) that may for account for diVerences between lectins in terms of their NO-releasing properties is warranted, especially considering the potential impact for manipulation of the lectin binding site under pathophysiological conditions, such as atherosclerosis, in which normal NO production is compromised (Landmesser et al., 2000). Evaluation of biological activities, such as vascular relaxation, may also constitute a means whereby lectins could be classiWed into distinct groups. Previous isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) studies by Dam et al. (1998) have shown that the Diocleinae lectins may be divided into two groups relating to their histamine-releasing properties: those with relatively high K and ¡ H for biantennary complex oligosaccharides such as ConA, C. brasiliensis, D. guianensis, and D. virgata lectins, all of which possess strong histamine-releasing activity; and those with signiWcantly lower K and ¡ H for biantennary complex oligosaccharides compared to the previous group, such as D. grandiXora, Cratylia Xoribunda, D. rostrata, and D. violacea lectins, all of which possess weak histamine-releasing activity. ConM belongs to the latter group of Diocleinae lectins, and hence would be expected to show little histamine-releasing activity in the rat peritoneal mast cells assay, as previously reported by Gomes et al. (1994) and Ferreira et al. (1996). Further detailed studies addressing the vascular activity of such lectins would be required to assess the feasibility of their classiWcation according to NOdependent relaxation of isolated blood vessels. 4. Conclusions The present study shows the crystal structure of a ConAlike lectin from seeds of C. maritima at 1.95 Å resolution. Although some crystal structures of ConA are already known, restricted information is available about the threedimensional structure of other Diocleinae lectins, particularly from the Canavalia genus. This group of lectins presents a high degree of similarity, but shows signiWcant diVerences in many biological properties. The amino acids residues previously suggested by manual sequencing have now been determined as I17, I53, V129, S134, G144, S164, P165, S187, S190, S169, T196, and S202. They confer 98% of similarity between ConM, ConA, and ConBr. ConM subunits display a high degree of tertiary folding and ion binding site conservation. The architecture of the "legume lectin fold" is built by jelly roll motifs; the monomers are formed by 16 antiparallel -strands intercon-

nected by turns and loops and three -helices. The biological activity is related to the quaternary structure, since the spatial distribution of carbohydrate-binding sites in oligomeric lectins determines the ability of these proteins to distinguish and cross-link multivalent saccharide ligands or speciWc cell-surface arrays of glycoconjugates. In ConM, this site is extended in comparison to ConA and permits the approximation of Y12 in the carbohydrate-binding site. A cross-link contact between canonical dimers stabilizes the structure with interactions at ASP78 with ARG60 and THR49 with SER119 residues. The loop Xexibility does not allow the existence of any considerable electron density in these regions that would show large diVerences compared to the search model. Examination of additional Canavalia lectin structures should undoubtedly contribute signiWcantly to further consideration of the molecular features of these lectins, which govern their quite distinct biological properties. In conclusion, our data show that the relaxant eVect of the lectin isolated from the ConM on isolated aortic rings occurs via interaction with a speciWc lectin-binding site on the endothelium, being more potent than ConA, resulting in a release of nitric oxide. These data reveal possibilities for classiWcation of Diocleinae lectins according to their biological activities and for establishing structural correlations.
