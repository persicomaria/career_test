Summary Mannose-binding type 1 pili are important virulence factors for the establishment of Escherichia coli urinary tract infections (UTIs). These infections are initiated by adhesion of uropathogenic E. coli to uroplakin receptors in the uroepithelium via the FimH adhesin located at the tips of type 1 pili. Blocking of bacterial adhesion is able to prevent infection. Here, we provide for the first time binding data of the molecular events underlying type 1 fimbrial adherence, by crystallographic analyses of the FimH receptor binding domains from a uropathogenic and a K-12 strain, and affinity measurements with mannose, common monoand disaccharides, and a series of alkyl and aryl mannosides. Our results illustrate that the lectin domain of the FimH adhesin is a stable and functional entity and that an exogenous butyl a-D-mannoside, bound in the crystal structures, exhibits a significantly better affinity for FimH (Kd = 0.15 mM) than mannose (Kd = 2.3 mM). Exploration of the binding affinities of a-D-mannosides with longer alkyl tails revealed affinities up to 5 nM. Aryl mannosides and fructose can also bind with high affinities to the FimH lectin domain, with a 100-fold improvement and 15-fold reduction in affinity, respectively, compared with mannose. Taken together, these relative FimH affinities correlate exceptionally well with the relative concentrations of the same glycans needed for the inhibition of adherence of type 1 piliated E. coli. We foresee that our findings will spark new ideas and initiatives for the development of UTI vaccines and anti-adhesive drugs to prevent anticipated and recurrent UTIs. Introduction Although normally a commensal inhabitant of the intestinal tract of mammals, Escherichia coli is also frequently associated with a number of infectious diseases. Like most other Gram-negative pathogens, E. coli can express a number of adhesive organelles assembled by several distinct pathways (Remaut and Waksman, 2004), allowing them to target and colonize specific niches in the host. Type 1 fimbriae (fim) and pyelonephritis-associated pili (pap) are well characterized adhesins of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) (Schilling et al., 2001; Mulvey, 2002; Berglund and Knight, 2003). The same UPEC strain often carries determinants for both adhesins that are switched on/off, in response to the local environment, by a regulatory

442 J. Bouckaert et al. cross-talk between the fim and pap operons (Xia et al., 2000). As such specific binding is ensured by fimbrial adherence to distinct cell surface receptors. Mannosebinding type 1 pili promote cystitis in the lower part of the urinary tract (Langermann et al., 1997; Ronald et al., 2001), by binding to a high-mannose glycoprotein, uroplakin Ia (Old, 1972; Firon et al., 1982; 1984; Wu et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 2001). In ascending urinary tract infections (UTIs), UPEC use P-pili to bind to galabiosecontaining glycolipid receptors in the kidney and initiate pyelonephritis (Kallenius et al., 1980; Leffler and Svanborg-Eden, 1980; Lund et al., 1987; Dodson et al., 2001). There has been controversy about the importance and role of type 1 pili in the gastrointestinal tract (Bloch et al., 1992; Orndorff et al., 2004) and in biofilm formation (Pratt and Kolter, 1998; Schembri et al., 2003), and its receptors are undefined in these environments. UPEC is the major causative agent of UTIs (Hooton and Stamm, 1997; Svanborg and Godaly, 1997). UTIs are a serious health problem affecting almost one in every two women at least once in their lifetime. The infections often recur within the months after the primary infection, despite proper use of antibiotics. UPEC can invade urothelial cells in a type 1 pilus-dependent mechanism. Once inside the cells, they form intracellular bacterial communities such as biofilms inside the bladder superficial umbrella cells, creating an environment protected from antibiotics and the immune system of the host (Justice et al., 2004). Bacteria within these communities exhibit regional expression of type 1 pili. A subpopulation of UPEC can flux back out of the cells and reinvade to ultimately establish a quiescent reservoir that may serve as a seed for recurrent infections (Mulvey et al., 1998). Of the various UPEC adhesins, type 1 pili are by far the most prevalent (Brinton, 1959; Buchanan et al., 1985; Hultgren et al., 1985; Langermann et al., 1997; BahraniMougeot et al., 2002), being expressed by a wide range of both pathogenic, commensal and laboratory strains (Fukiya et al., 2004). Type 1 pili consist of a linear string of repeating, non-covalently linked, immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) FimA subunits wound into a rigid right-handed helical rod, followed by a short and stubby tip fibrillum composed of the FimF and FimG adaptor subunits and the FimH adhesin. The pilus is assembled by the chaperone/usher pathway (Thanassi et al., 1998; Knight et al., 2000; Sauer et al., 2000) by complementing the incomplete Ig fold of each constituent pilus subunit with an amino-terminal extension from a neighbouring subunit in a process termed `donor strand exchange' (Choudhury et al., 1999; Sauer et al., 1999; 2002; Zavialov et al., 2003). FimH is a two-domain adhesin protein at the end of the tip fibrillum, responsible for the mannose-sensitive bacterial adhesion. The amino-terminal lectin domain (residues 1­158) is joined to the carboxy-terminal pilin domain (residues 159­279) that links the adhesin to the rest of the pilus. Bacterial two-domain adhesins such as FimH are not soluble unless their pilin domain is complemented by a `donor strand'. However, truncates of adhesins corresponding to only the lectin domain have previously been shown to be properly folded and functional (Schembri et al., 2000; Dodson et al., 2001; Buts et al., 2003). The primary physiological receptor for FimH in the urinary tract is the glycoprotein uroplakin Ia (Zhou et al., 2001; Min et al., 2002) that is abundantly present on differentiated uroepithelial cells. However, FimH recognizes a wide range of glycoproteins carrying one or more Nlinked high-mannose structures. FimH also binds yeast mannans and mediates agglutination of yeast cells. FimHmediated adhesion can be inhibited by D-mannose (Old, 1972; Hung et al., 2002) and a variety of natural and synthetic saccharides containing terminal mannose residues (Firon et al., 1982; 1983; 1984; 1987; Neeser et al., 1986; Lindhorst et al., 1998; Nagahori et al., 2002). Blocking of the FimH­receptor interaction has been shown to prevent bacterial adhesion to the bladder uroepithelium and thereby infection (Langermann et al., 1997; 2000; Thankavel et al., 1997; Langermann and Ballou, 2003). Increasing incidence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics has rejuvenated the interest in understanding the molecular basis for FimH-mediated adhesion to provide complementary or alternative treatments of UTIs. However, for reasons becoming obvious in this article, no binding analyses of FimH­carbohydrate interactions at the molecular level have previously been published. Also no structural information exists to explain the increased adhesion inhibition exhibited by oligomannosides (Firon et al., 1982; 1983; 1984; Neeser et al., 1986; Lindhorst et al., 1998) or by some aglycon-substituted mannosides (Firon et al., 1984; 1987; Nagahori et al., 2002). In two independently determined crystal structures of the FimH lectin domain, of an E. coli K-12 strain and a uropathogenic strain, respectively, we made the serendipitous discovery of a `sticky' ligand, butyl a-D-mannoside, in the mannose binding site. The heterogeneity caused by this `sticky' contaminant rendered several approaches for measuring binding affinities of the purified FimH lectin domain for its natural carbohydrate receptors useless or at least highly unpredictable. The origin of butyl a-D-mannoside was examined and this knowledge was used to produce butyl a-D-mannoside-free FimH. We determined for the first time FimH binding constants for several hexoses, including mannose, two disaccharides, two aryl mannosides, and synthetic alkyl mannosides with different chain lengths. We find that simple alkyl mannosides bind with nanomolar affinities to FimH. Also fructose binds more tightly to the FimH fimbrial adhesin than, for example, the PapGII adhesin to its natural receptor. These

A novel class of FimH high-affinity ligands 443 highly specific, small-molecule inhibitors, targeting with high-affinity the FimH mannose binding site, may prevent UTIs by interfering with the attachment of E. coli to the uroepithelial cells lining the bladder mucosa. Results Affinity of FimH for mono- and disaccharides Two different binding assays were developed, one based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and one based on equilibrium binding measurements using radioactively labelled mannose (Table 1). Inhibition by mannose of the binding of FimH to the immobilized Fab fragments of the monoclonal antibody IC10 [ka = 1.47 ¥ 104 (±41.7) M-1 s-1, kd = 4.11 ¥ 10-3 (±5.65 ¥ 10-6)s-1, Kd = 280 ¥ 10-7 (±8.8 ¥ 10-9) M] in SPR measurements allowed us to derive a solution affinity of mannose for FimH (Kd = 2.3 mM) (Table 1). Using either the Fabs of monoclonal antibody IA7 or BSA-Man as the immobilized binding partner in the competition experiment gave equivalent dissociation constants for the FimH­mannose interaction (data not shown). To eliminate the possibility of different binding strength for full-length FimH and FimH truncates, the binding of D-mannose to FimC:FimH complex was also measured. A value of Kd = 5.3 mM was obtained, in good agreement with the value measured using FimH truncates. Removal of the 2-OH group of mannose leads to a 100fold reduction in affinity for FimH (Table 2). Glucose, the equatorial O2 epimer of mannose, binds a 4000-fold weaker. There is virtually no affinity for galactose, the O4 (axial) epimer and O2 (equatorial) epimer of mannose. Fructose binds strongly to FimH (Kd = 31 mM), although a 15-fold weaker than mannose. The fructose-containing disaccharides sucrose [Glc(a1­2)Frufb] and turanose [Glc(a1­3)Frub] have affinities for FimH very similar to glucose.

Structure of the FimH lectin domain The lectin domains FimH truncate 1 (FimHtr1) originating from the UPEC strain J96, and FimH truncate 2 (FimHtr2), from the E. coli K-12 laboratory strain MG1655, were cloned, expressed and crystallized. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the lectin domain from the FimC:FimH complex (Choudhury et al., 1999) as a search model, and refined to 1.7 Å (FimHtr1) and 2.1 Å (FimHtr2) resolution respectively (Table S1 in Supplementary material). Both models include residues 1­158, corresponding to the entire lectin domain of FimH. Two copies of the lectin domain are present per asymmetric unit of the FimHtr2 crystals, compared with only one unit for the FimHtr1 crystals. The carboxy-terminal 6-His tag of FimHtr2 is not visible in the electron density maps and is not included in the model. The structures of the FimH lectin domains are very similar to the structure for the same domain in the FimC:FimH complex, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) over all 158 Ca positions of 0.36 Å for FimHtr1, 0.56 Å for FimHtr2 subunit A, and 0.54 Å for FimHtr2 subunit B. The secondary structure elements, arranged in an Ig fold (Buts et al., 2003) (Fig. 1A), have almost interchangeable Ca traces in all of the FimH lectin domain structures. Only Gly73 (in strand D1) and Gly79 (in loop connecting strands D1 and D¢) have slightly variable main chain conformations, while Val30 in the b3­b4 loop at the base of the domain clearly undergoes a peptide flip in all three subunits of the truncate compared with the FimC:FimH complex. In the FimHtr1 structure, the conformation of the carboxy-terminal residue of the truncate, Thr158, differs as it is packed against and hydrogen bonded to a glycerol molecule via its carboxylate group. In the FimHtr2 crystal structure, the main difference is in the b9­b10 loop with an r.m.s.d. of 2.9 Å over Ca atoms 113­116. This loop adopts a different conformation because of crystal packing contacts that are not present in the FimC:FimH or FimHtr1 structures.

initial Fo­Fc and 2Fo­Fc Fourier maps inside the mannosebinding pocket of both FimHtr1 and FimHtr2. This density precisely defined a-D-mannose, with an additional elongated density shaped like a creased tail, extending outwards from the mannose O1 and towards tyrosines 48 and 137, which make up part of the hydrophobic rim around the mannose-binding pocket (Fig. 1B) (Hung et al., 2002). Further refinement strongly suggested that a butyl a-D-mannoside was bound in the mannose-binding site (Fig 1B and C). For FimHtr1, also a change in the conformation of the Tyr48 side-chain, compared with the one from the model FimH used for molecular replacement, was immediately apparent. As described previously (Hung et al., 2002), the mannose ring makes 10 direct hydrogen bonds to the side-chains of residues Asp54, Gln133, Asn135 and Asp140, and to the main chain of Phe1 and Asp47, and indirect water-mediated hydrogen bonds via O2 to the side-chain of Glu133 and to the main chain oxygen of Phe1 and Gly14. The alpha-anomeric hydroxyl group O1 of mannose is involved in a hydrogen-bonding water network with the Asn138 and Asp140 side-chains, through a water molecule (wat 2, Fig. 1B) that is con-

served between the two truncate structures. The positions of the other waters participating in this network depend on the crystal packing of FimHtr1 and FimHtr2. Mass spectrometric analysis of the bound ligand To corroborate the nature of the ligand identified in the crystal structures, the complex of FimHtr1 and its presumed butyl a-D-mannoside was analysed using mass spectrometry. The FimHtr1 protein sample used for crystallization was subjected to peracetylation and phase separation. The peracetylated ligand retrieved in the organic phase was analysed by nanoLC-online-ESI-MS. The peracetylated ligand eluted as a single peak and was registered in its sodiated form at m/z 427 corresponding to butyl hexose (Fig. 2A). No signals corresponding to other potential alkyl mannose species like ethyl hexose (m/z 399), propyl hexose (m/z 413) or pentyl hexose (m/z 441) could be observed, indicating a homogeneous ligand with a four-carbon atoms alkyl chain. Besides the sodium adduct of the ligand, a major signal was observed arising from the loss of butanol (m/z 331; Fig. 2B). Cleavage at

the anomeric carbon atom was often combined with elimination of one or more acetic acid molecules (mass decrease of 60 Da) or acetyl groups (mass decrease of 42 Da). These eliminations gave rise to the major ions at m/z 127 and m/z 169 with a proposed aromatic ring structure as well as to the ion at m/z 109 with a proposed quinone-like ring structure. Thus, the mass spectrometric data support the butyl hexose nature of the FimH ligand. FimH was further characterized by carbohydrate constituent analysis (data not shown), which revealed only mannose. Mannose could only be detected after hydrolysis, indicating that free mannose is not associated with the FimH truncate. Origin of butyl a-D-mannoside As no sugar had been advertently added to the FimHtr protein samples, we hypothesized that the butyl mannoside ligand had been picked up from the Luria­Bertani (LB) medium used to grow bacteria during expression of the protein. To test this, FimHtr2 was expressed in bacteria grown in minimal M9 medium. Electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed on purified FimHtr2 samples from both types of media. A clear peak at 259 Da could be detected (Fig. 3A) with protein expressed in bacteria grown in LB medium, corresponding to the molecular weight of butyl mannoside (236 Da) plus

a sodium ion (23 Da). As a control, butyl mannoside was synthesized and analysed in the same manner. Again a peak at 259 Da was observed (Fig. 3A, inset). When ESIMS was run on protein expressed in bacteria grown in minimal medium, no such peak could be detected (Fig. 3B), indicating that the ligand was not present and that it indeed originated from the LB medium. Interactions of the butyl moiety with FimH The butyl moiety of butyl a-D-mannoside extends out of the mannose-binding pocket towards Tyr48 and Tyr137, making van der Waals contacts to both tyrosine rings and Ile52 (Fig. 1B and C). These residues are part of two loops (b4­b5 and b10­b11) that form the higher rear end of a hydrophobic collar around the binding site (Fig. 1A and B). In both subunits of the FimHtr2 structure, the Tyr48 and Tyr137 side-chains are in the same, almost parallel, orientation as in the FimC:FimH structure, forming a gatelike structure at the back of the binding site (Fig. 1C). The closest hydrophobic interactions (3.1­3.6 Å) with the alkyl chain are made between Tyr48 and the two non-terminal atoms of the butyl. In the FimHtr1 structure, a crystal contact to Val155 of a neighbouring molecule prevents the parallel orientation of the Tyr48 ring, which instead is packed edge-to-face with Tyr137 (Fig. 1B). The repositioning of Tyr48 is accompanied by a change in the confor-

mation of the butyl chain of the ligand, with the butyl chain in a more extended conformation than in the FimHtr2 structure, and with the four carbon atoms nearly in one plane (Fig 1B and C). The new conformations of Tyr48 and the butyl moiety result in an almost parallel stacking of the aromatic ring of Tyr48 onto the butyl plane, with the closest hydrophobic interactions (3.7 Å) involving the two terminal carbon atoms of the butyl (Fig. 1B). Affinity measurements for alkyl mannosides The butyl mannoside ligand remained bound to FimHtr despite extensive dialysis. From a study of complex formation of monoclonal antibodies IC10 and IA7 with FimHtr1, it could be estimated that about 30% of the FimH truncate retained its ligand after dialysis for 12 days against 50 mM MES buffer at pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, despite daily refreshment of buffer (data not shown). Therefore, to enable measurements of dissociation constants of FimH for mannosides, FimH was produced in minimal medium. Butyl a-D-mannoside binding is 15 times improved (Kd = 151 nM; Fig. 4A) compared with mannose binding. The equilibrium binding technique using [3H]mannose led to a similar value (Kd = 4.1 mM; Fig. 4B) for

mannose and an almost identical value for butyl a-Dmannoside (Kd = 150 nM; Fig. 4C). To investigate the effect of sequential addition of methyl groups to the O1 oxygen of D-mannose, a series of alkyl mannosides were synthesized and the dissociation constants determined using the [3H]-mannose displacement assay as well as the SPR competition assay (Table 1). There is a linear correlation between the binding free energy, as calculated from the measured dissociation constants, and the number of methyl groups (between 1 and 7) in the alkyl mannoside, with each additional methyl group contributing on average -0.6 kcal mol-1 of binding energy (Fig. 5). Affinity measurements and modelling for aryl mannosides Aromatically substituted mannosides have been reported to be particularly potent inhibitors of FimH-mediated bacterial adhesion (Firon et al., 1987; Nagahori et al., 2002). In accordance with the earlier results, both pNPaMan and MeUmbaMan bind very tightly to FimH (Table 1). Despite extensive trials, no X-ray structures were obtained for complexes with aromatically substituted mannosides. In order to model binding, docking to both of the truncate structures was carried out. In all cases, the mannose ring

our two FimH truncate structures leads to different predicted interactions between the aromatic aglycon, and Tyr48 and Tyr137. Docking to the FimHtr2 structure resulted in somewhat tighter interactions between the tyrosine gate and the aglycon and hence in somewhat lower docking energies. Calculated FimHtr2 docking energies of Edoc = -10.4 kcal mol-1 for pNPaMan (Kd = 46 nM) and Edoc = -10.9 kcal mol-1 for MeUmbaMan (Kd = 20 nM) are in good agreement with the experimental binding data (Table 1). The docked umbelliferyl ring system is inserted deep into the tyrosine gate in the FimHtr2 conformation, with the carbonyl group within hydrogen bonding distance to Thr51 at the back of the gate (Fig. 6A). Docking to the FimHtr1 structure instead stacks the umbelliferyl ring faceto-face with the Tyr48 ring (not shown). The phenyl ring of pNPaMan docks similarly to both our structures. It does not quite reach in between the tyrosine side-chains, but instead hydrogen bonds with its nitro group to the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr137 (Fig. 6B). Discussion Most lectins bind naturally occurring carbohydrates with low affinities, often in the millimolar range for monosaccharides and micromolar range for oligosaccharides. This was recently exemplified to also hold true for the adhesins of F17 fimbriae (Kd = 1.2 mM for the F17a-GN-acetylglucosamine interaction; Buts et al., 2003) and P pili (Kd = 84 mM for the PapGII-globotetraoside interaction; Larsson et al., 2003). The recent crystal structure of FimH in complex with mannose illustrated that FimH almost completely envelops the monosaccharide in a deep pocket and involves it in an intense hydrogen bonding network, suggestive of an unusual lectin exerting high affinities (Hung et al., 2002).

The measured affinity confirm the predictions that FimH binds the monosacharide mannose exceptionally well (Kd = 2.3­4.1 mM). To investigate the contribution of the different hydroxyl groups of mannose in the interaction with FimH, the binding of a series of hexoses to butyl mannoside-free FimH was examined using SPR (Table 2). The effect of deoxygenation of the O2 hydroxyl group (methyl 2-deoxy-a-D-mannopyranoside) is clearly less destructive (100-fold reduction) than its equatorial position as in glucose. O2 is the only hydroxyl group of mannose that interacts indirectly with the FimH pocket, via a conserved water molecule (Hung et al., 2002). Glucose only displays a weak affinity for FimH, about 4000 times lower than methyl a-D-mannoside. Repositioning of both the O2 and O4 hydroxyl groups as in galactose abolishes sugar binding by FimH. Similar to these results, the inhibitory concentrations for bacterial adherence of methyl a-Dglucoside and galactose derivatives have been estimated to be, respectively, 104-fold and 105-fold weaker than for methyl a-D-mannoside (Nagahori et al., 2002). In stark contrast with the other monosaccharides, fructose has a binding affinity only about 15-fold less than mannose for FimH (Table 2). The decrease in affinity for

fructose relative to mannose agrees with studies of inhibition of adherence of type 1 piliated E. coli by fructose, in which fructose was found to be the active compound in fruit juices (present at about 5%) (Zafriri et al., 1989). Fructose binding to FimH is stronger than the binding of the physiological globotetraoside receptor to PapGII, the other well-characterized adhesin of UPEC strains (Larsson et al., 2003). The pyranose form of fructose is very well superimposable onto mannose in the FimH binding site, where similar interactions are established with FimH as for mannose, except for the loss of the anomeric O1 and an extra hydroxyl group (O2) on the C5 position of mannose. Probably, however, both changes of fructopyranoside compared with mannopyranoside could be easily accommodated by FimH. The mannose O1 does not make direct interactions within 4.5 Å of the FimH binding pocket (Fig. 1B). The extra O2 group of fructose would not clash or interfere significantly with the binding pocket, but it would make a 2.7 Å van der Waals contact with the Ile52 side-chain, under the condition that the Ile52 side-chain does not move. The crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB also showed that fructopyranose, but not fructofuranose, can substitute for mannose (Loris

A novel class of FimH high-affinity ligands 449 et al., 2003a). Hydrogen bonds of the more specific fucose complex are replaced by van der Waals interactions involving a hydroxyl group in the complexes with the lower-affinity binders mannose and fructopyranose, as for the proposed fructopyranoside binding to FimH. The fructose-containing disaccharides sucrose and turanose do not have an inhibitory effect and bind with affinities similar to glucose. Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar that has fructose locked in its furanose form. Turanose, on the other hand, allows the interconversion of bD-fructofuranose and b-D-fructopyranose, e.g. both forms occur in complex with a plant lectin from Pterocarpus angolensis (Loris et al., 2003b). It is predictable, however, from the crystal structures that the glycosidic linkage of glucose with C3 of fructose, equivalent in position to C4 of mannose, would be disallowed in the tight FimH pocket. Sucrose and turanose thus most probably interact with the FimH mannose binding pocket via their glucose moiety, resulting in similar low affinities. Our mass spectrometry and chemical analyses confirms the crystallographic identification of the ligand bound to the FimH lectin domains as butyl a-D-mannoside (Figs 1B and 2). The mannose ring of the butyl a-Dmannoside coincides with the mannose bound to the FimC:FimH complex (Hung et al., 2002) and makes the same interactions. The four-carbon alkyl tail exits towards the back wall (loop b4­b5 and b10­b11) of the pocket (Fig. 1A and B), making hydrophobic contacts to Tyr48, Tyr137 and Ile52. The mass spectrometry data also show that the bound butyl a-D-mannoside is present in LB medium but absent from minimal medium. Hence, the source of the alkyl mannoside is possibly the yeast extract used in preparation of LB medium. Although we do not want to speculate about the significance of this finding, alkyl mannoside production by yeast has not been reported and might warrant investigation. The butyl mannoside was retained by FimH despite extensive dialysis. The phenomenon of ligand retention by protein was described as early as 1975 for periplasmic binding proteins (Silhavy et al., 1975). Applied to dialysis of butyl mannoside away from FimH grown in rich medium, half-lives of up to 30 h can be estimated, which is far beyond the duration of a normal buffer exchange dialysis experiment. In the present case, the retained ligand does not appear to seriously affect [3H]-mannose displacement equilibrium binding experiments as we could detect no significant differences in dissociation constants obtained using FimHtr2 produced in LB or minimal media (data not shown). In contrast, proper SPR binding curves could not be obtained when butyl mannoside occupied the binding site. Hence, the displacement technique may be of more general use to obtain binding constants for proteins that tend to inadvertently retain ligands, which is a common trait of lectins.

Surface plasmon resonance as well as equilibrium binding and displacement measurements using [3H]-mannose were carried out to obtain dissociation constants for a-Dmannose and a linear series of alkyl-substituted mannosides to FimH (Table 1). Both equilibrium binding experiments show a very good agreement in their measurement of the carbohydrate affinity of the adhesin. FimH binds butyl a-D-mannoside 15­30 times stronger than a-Dmannose. The importance of the added hydrophobic contacts is clearly demonstrated by the binding of alkyl mannosides (Table 1). The best binding alkyl mannosides bind a few hundred times stronger than mannose, equivalent in affinity to the most tightly binding aromatically substituted mannosides for FimH (Firon et al., 1987) and of mannose dendrimers for type 1 piliated E. coli (Firon et al., 1984; 1987; Nagahori et al., 2002). Interestingly, the butyl moiety takes on significantly different conformations in FimHtr1 and FimHtr2 (Fig. 1C), indicating that intrinsic conformational flexibility in the aglycon is allowed. Indeed, in spite of the larger flexibility expected for longer alkyl mannosides, the binding energy decreases linearly with increasing length of the alkyl chain between one and seven carbon atoms (Fig. 5). The affinity reaches its maximum for mannose with a seven-carbon alkyl, and SPR measurements suggest that the affinity decreases from eight carbon atoms on. Evidently, the eighth carbon atom goes beyond the hydrophobic interaction surface and protein edge, which is penalized with a decrease in affinity. We propose that the affinity increase results from an increased interaction surface with the hydrophobic gateway. Alkyl aglycons fit well in the tyrosine gate, and as observed in the two crystal structures in at least two different conformations that depend on the conformation of Tyr48. This flexibility may indicate that aglycons can interact rather non-specifically with the hydrophobic gateway, nevertheless resulting in a 100- to 1000-fold increase in affinity. FimH binding to ligands other than just mannose is possibly of importance in terms of the different environments that E. coli will encounter ­ the urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract and in biofilms. Alkyl mannosides have not been previously recognized as strong binders to FimH. As they are easily synthesized and highly soluble in water, they may be interesting as potential blocking agents for FimH-mediated adhesion. Moreover, they have been shown to be good drug vehicles themselves, acting as permeability enhancers on tight junctions (Eley and Triumalashetty, 2001). As such they might be able to penetrate into deeper cell layers of the epithelium to also prevent those bacteria that form a quiescent reservoir from causing recurrent infections (Mulvey et al., 1998; Justice et al., 2004). On the other hand, the two aromatically substituted mannosides, pNPaMan and MeUmbaMan, are known to

450 J. Bouckaert et al. be particularly potent inhibitors of FimH-mediated bacterial adhesion (Firon et al., 1987; Nagahori et al., 2002). Based on adhesion inhibition studies using type 1 piliated E. coli and guinea pig ileal epithelial cells, the relative inhibitory potential of pNPaMan and MeUmbaMan have been estimated to be about 70 and 600 times stronger, respectively, than that of methyl a-D-mannose (Firon et al., 1987). Our measurements indicate an affinity of FimH for pNPaMan and MeUmbaMan between 50 and 90 times and between 110 and 200 times higher, respectively, than for methyl a-D-mannose, in good agreement with the adhesion inhibition results (Firon et al., 1987). Dissociation constants predicted using AutoDock3 (Morris et al., 1998) are similar to experimental values. The computational docking predicts that tight binding of the aromatically substituted mannosides, pNPaMan and MeUmbaMan, is accomplished similarly as for butyl a-Dmannoside, with the aglycon interacting with the tyrosine gate. This is the first systematic study providing molecular binding data for the FimH adhesin, the prerequisite for colonization by UPEC (Langermann and Ballou, 2003). We also show crystallographic evidence that the lectin, or receptor binding, domain of FimH is a stable and functional entity. Its structure is virtually identical to the same domain in the FimC:FimH complex, indicating that a truncate corresponding to the lectin domain could provide a good alternative for the development of a UTI vaccine (Langermann et al., 1997; Langermann and Ballou, 2003). However, progress of this interesting UTI vaccine candidate into clinical trials has not been reported. The binding affinities of FimH at the molecular level relate convincingly well with the inhibitory concentrations used in previous bacterial adhesion assays, thus endorsing the direct and conclusive correlation of FimH with bacterial adherence. Alkyl mannosides have nanomolar affinities for FimH, which may overcome the significant obstacle of low affinity generally encountered in attempts to develop carbohydrate-based drugs which interfere with microbial attachment to host cell surface glycoconjugates. New anti-adhesive drugs could be based on these leads, to allow specific interaction and targeting to the urinary tract in order to prevent anticipated and recurrent infections.
C600 cells. FimHtr2 (residues 1­158 of E. coli MG1655 FimH + carboxy-terminal 6-His tag) was expressed from plasmid pPKL241 (Schembri et al., 2000) transformed into E. coli host strain HB101.

Purification and crystallization
FimHtr1. Bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37C, induced at OD600 = 0.8 with 1 mM IPTG and harvested 2­3 h later. The cells were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA and 30% sucrose, and the periplasmic content was extracted by osmotic shock upon 10-fold dilution with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Purification of FimHtr1 was performed by ion exchange chromatography with MonoS at pH 4.5 followed by MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences) at pH 8. FimHtr1 was crystallized using vapour diffusion in hanging drops composed of 3 ml of the precipitant solution (0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5; 12% PEG 6000 and 5% v/v methyl-2,4-pentanediol) and 3 ml of 12 mg ml-1 protein solution in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 150 mM NaCl. FimHtr2. Cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 mg ml-1 ampicillin at 37C. At OD600 = 0.6, the cells were induced with 5 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested 2 h after induction and the periplasmic content was extracted. The protein was purified on a Pharmacia HiTrap Chelating HP 5 ml column (Pharmacia) loaded with Ni-chloride, and eluted with a sharp 0­500 mM imidazole gradient. Fractions containing FimHtr2 were pooled, dialysed against 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.25, and loaded onto a Mono S HR 8 ml column. The protein was eluted with a 0­500 mM NaCl gradient, and dialysed overnight against 20 mM MES pH 6.5 before crystallization. Crystallization was performed at room temperature, by the vapour diffusion method with hanging drops made by mixing of 2 ml of 15 mg ml-1 protein solution with 2 ml of the precipitant solution (65% methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 100 mM cacodylate pH 6.5). Microseeding was employed to optimize crystal quality and reproducibility. Crystals suitable for X-ray data collection generally appeared within 48 h after microseeding.

Structure determination
X-ray data for FimHtr1 were collected from a single crystal to 1.7 Å resolution at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, USA. The crystal was flashcooled to 100 K in the precipitant solution complemented with 25% glycerol. The data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) (Table S1 in Supplementary material). Data for FimHtr2 were collected from a single crystal under liquid-nitrogen cryo conditions at 100 K at beamline ID29, ESRF, Grenoble, France, to 2.1 Å Bragg spacing. FimHtr2 data were processed and reduced using MOSFLM (Powell, 1999) and scaled using SCALA (Collaborative computational project, 1994) (Table S1 in Supplementary material). The structures of FimHtr1 and FimHtr2 were solved by molecular replacement using Amore (Navaza, 2001) and MOLREP (Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997), respectively, with the FimH lectin domain from the FimC:FimH complex (Choudhury et al.,

Experimental procedures Strains and constructs
FimH proteins from two different E. coli strains, the UPEC strain J96 (Hull et al., 1981) and the E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 (Blattner et al., 1997), were used in this study. The FimH adhesins encoded by these two E. coli strains are identical. FimHtr1 (residues 1­158 of UPEC J96 FimH) was expressed from plasmid pMMB91 transformed into E. coli

Positional, bulk solvent and isotropic temperature factor refinement was performed using CNS (Brünger et al., 1998) and REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) respectively. Model adjustment and inspection were performed using Turbo-Frodo and O (Jones et al., 1991) graphics programs respectively. Refinement statistics are given in Table S1. Molecular graphics illustrations were generated with Bobscript (Esnouf, 1997) and Pymol 0.90 (DeLano Scientific LLC, 1998­2003, http:// pymol.sourceforge.net). were obtained from Sigma. Monomannosylated bovine serum albumin (BSA-Man) was kindly provided by MedImmune. We synthesized methyl 2-deoxy-a-D-mannopyranoside (Oscarson and Tedebark, 1995). Alkyl mannosides were synthesized through silver triflate-promoted couplings of the corresponding alcohol with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl-a-Dmannopyranosyl bromide, followed by Zemplén deacylation of the obtained protected alkyl mannosides, according to the procedure reported for the octyl and tetradecyl mannosides (Oscarson and Tiden, 1993).

Mass spectrometry
The purified FimHtr1 protein (300 mg) that had been used for crystallization was freeze-dried, taken up in 100 ml of pyridine and 100 ml of acetic anhydride, and incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark for peracetylation. The sample was dried under nitrogen and taken up in chloroform (400 ml). The chloroform phase was extracted six times with water, dried and taken up in 200 ml of 50% aqueous methanol. A 1 ml aliquot was applied to a nano-scale RP column (75 mm ¥ 100 mm; PepMap, Dionex/LC Packings) using an Ultimate nano-LC system (LC Packings), which was equilibrated with eluent A (H2O/acetonitrile 95:5, v/v, containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 100 nl min-1. After injecting the sample, the column was run isocratically for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% eluent B (H2O/acetonitrile 20:80, v/v, containing 0.1% formic acid) in 20 min and a final wash with 100% B for 5 min. The system was directly coupled to an Esquire 3000 ESI-IT-MS (Bruker Daltonik) equipped with an online nanospray source operating in the positive-ion mode. For electrospray (900­1200 V), capillaries (360 mm OD, 20 mm ID with 10 mm opening) from New Objective were used. The solvent was evaporated at 150C with a nitrogen stream of 6 l min-1. To verify the suspected source of the bound butyl mannoside, mass spectrometry was performed on samples of FimHtr2, grown in either LB or minimal M9 medium. Protein samples were dialysed against water overnight before mass spectrometry in order to reduce background from the Tris buffer. Samples were diluted to a concentration in the submicromolar range. Electrospray mass spectra were recorded in direct inlet mode (50% aqueous methanol solutions) on a Bruker Daltonics Esquire-LC (Billerica).

Binding studies
Competition experiments using SPR. To obtain butyl mannoside-free FimHtr1, the FimH truncate was overproduced, with a carboxy-terminal 6-His tag, after transformation into E. coli C43 (DE3) (Miroux and Walker, 1996), and the bacteria grown in minA minimal medium supplemented with the 20 amino acids (40 mg l-1), thiamin (2 mg l-1) and biotin (2 mg l-1). Purification of the His-tagged protein was performed using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen) in 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8 and 300 mM NaCl. Elution was in the same solution complemented with 500 mM imidazole. Subsequently, pooled and concentrated FimH fractions were gel filtrated over a Superdex G75 column (Pharmacia) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. We used Fab fragments of a monoclonal antibody against the mannose-binding site of FimH to determine the solution affinity of FimH­carbohydrate interactions. The monoclonal antibody IC10 was produced by a mouse hybridoma cell line at Medimmune. and its Fab fragments were prepared and purified. The Fabs were covalently immobilized via amine coupling at 1000 Resonance Units (1000 pg ligand mm-2) in flowcell Fc2 on a CM5 biasensor chip (BIAapplications Handbook, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Flowcell Fc1 was used as the reference surface and was treated in the same way as Fc2 except that it was blocked immediately after activation. The immobilization buffer was 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 with 100 mM NaCl. All SPR measurements were performed on a Biacore3000TM. The kinetic constants of binding of FimH to the immobilized antibody were measured with different concentrations of FimH (2000 nM, 1000 nM, 500 nM, 250 nM, 125 nM, 62.5 nM, 31.2 nM, 15.6 nM, 7.8 nM) in running buffer [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.005% surfactant P20 and 3 mM EDTA], on both flowcells Fc1 and Fc2 simultaneously, at a flow rate of 30 ml min-1 and at 298 K. Complete dissociation of FimH was performed with running buffer before starting a new binding cycle. For all measurements, the association time was 3 min, and the dissociation time was 30 min. All binding cycles were performed in duplicate, including a zero concentration cycle of FimH (injection of running buffer). All analyses were performed with the BIAeval software. A Langmuir binding isotherm with a 1:1 stoichiometry was fitted to the data from both the association phase and the dissociation phase, after subtraction of the reference and zero concentration data. The kinetic constants, ka and kd, and the maximal binding, Rmax, were obtained and the dissociation constant Kd was calculated. The equilibrium dissociation constants Kd of FimH­saccharide interactions were determined in a competition experiment, using the same chip as for the previous experiment.

Carbohydrate constituent analysis
Samples were hydrolysed in 100 ml of 4 M aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma) at 100C for 4 h, and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Monosaccharides were converted into their anthranilic acid derivatives by reductive amination, resolved by RP-HPLC and detected by fluorescence (Anumula, 1994).

Carbohydrates for binding studies
[3H]-mannose was obtained from Amersham. Methyl a-Dmannoside, glucose, galactose, fructose, sucrose, turanose, p-nitrophenyl a-D-mannopyranoside (pNPaMan) and 4methylumbelliferyl a-D-mannopyranoside (MeUmbaMan)

452 J. Bouckaert et al.
As a control, the Fabs of monoclonal antibody IA7, as well as BSA-Man, were also immobilized. Samples containing a fixed concentration of FimH were used (close to the Kd of the FimH­antibody interaction) in combination with varying concentrations of saccharide. First, 10-fold dilutions of the saccharide solution were used to determine the concentration range for binding of the saccharide to FimH. A Langmuir binding isotherm with a 1:1 stoichiometry was fitted to the data, using the kinetic constants and R max from the foregoing experiment, to obtain the concentrations of FimH that were free ([FimH]free) to bind the antibody immobilized on the chip. Second, the concentration range of the saccharide was extended and adapted to ensure accurate fitting, and the equilibrium binding constant of the FimH­saccharide interaction was derived from the curve of [FimH]free against concentration of saccharide. Every measurement was repeated at least twice, including testing different protein batches and whenever possible also different saccharide stock solutions (typically 200 mM). Equilibrium binding studies using radioactively labelled mannose. Mannose-free FimHtr2 was produced in M9 minimal medium and purified as described above for FimHtr2. Alkyl mannosides were dissolved in double distilled water. pNPaMan and MeUmbaMan (6 mg each) were dissolved in 20 ml of DMSO and diluted to 20 mM using double distilled water. Binding experiments were performed at 310 K using six different concentrations of [3H]-a-D-mannose (final concentrations 43.5 mM, 29.0 mM, 19.3 mM, 12.9 mM, 8.6 mM and 5.7 mM). Protein (180 ml) at a concentration of about 500 nM was mixed with 20 ml of the radioactive ligand [3H]a-D-mannose, and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. To separate free ligand from bound, the mixture was rapidly filtrated through a Protran BA 85 cellulose nitrate filter (Schleicher and Schuell), and washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold 1¥ PBS. Filter-bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectrometry within 24 h. Displacement experiments were performed using six different concentrations of inhibitor (final concentrations in the range 0.0­43.5 mM) in the presence of 43.5 mM [3H]-a-D-mannose. Twenty microlitres of radioactive ligand, 20 ml of inhibitor and 160 ml of protein (500 nM) were mixed, and the experiments were performed as described above. All experiments were performed in duplicates and the data presented are mean values of at least two independent measurements. For the determination of Kd for a-D-mannose, an hyperbolic curve (y = P1x/(P2 + x), where P1 is an arbitrary scale factor and P2 = Kd) was fitted to the data. For the displacement experiments, the curve y = P1/(P2 + x), where P1 is an arbitrary scale factor and P2 is the concentration of the inhibitor displacing 50% of the labelled ligand, [I] 0.5 was used instead. To calculate the inhibitor dissociation constant (K I), the Cheng and Prusoff equation [KI = [I]0.5/[L]KL + 1); KL is the constant of dissociation for the ligand] (Cheng and Prusoff, 1973), was used when both the concentration of the radioactive ligand (L) and the displacing agent (I) are in excess over the protein (LT >> PT; IT >> PT, T indicates total concentration). For the two strong inhibitors pNPaMan and MeUmbaMan, where IT was not in excess over PT, the equation of KI = IT/[(1 - Y)/Y*(LT/KL) - 1] - PT*KL*Y/LT, where Y is the fraction of the ligand bound in presence of the inhibitor, was used instead (Horovitz and Levitzki, 1987).

Computational docking
Computational docking studies were performed using AutoDock3 (Morris et al., 1998). In AutoDock3, the protein is represented by a grid of affinity potentials. Hence, the protein conformation is not allowed to change during the docking procedure. Flexibility of ligands is taken into account by allowing rotation around flexible torsion angles. The docked energies are calculated as the sum of the intermolecular interaction energy and the internal energy of the ligand. The search for the best interaction energy was carried out by means of the Lamarckian genetic algorithm. Ligand structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank and prepared for docking by adding hydrogens and charges using AutoDockTools (Sanner et al., 1996). Each simulation consisted of 100 independent runs, with a population size of 200, 500 generations, and a maximum of 25 000 000 energy evaluations. Solutions were ranked based on their docking energies, and similar solutions were clustered (cluster cut-off r.m.s.d. < 1 Å). For both ligands, the top solutions were evaluated using the graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991).
