Structures of -Ketoacyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Synthase I Complexed with Fatty Acids Elucidate its Catalytic Machinery
Johan Gotthardt Olsen*, Anders Kadziola*, Penny von Wettstein-Knowles§, Mads Siggaard-Andersen, and Sine Larsen*§ * Centre for Crystallographic Studies University of Copenhagen Copenhagen, DK-2100 Denmark  Department of Genetics Institute of Molecular Biology University of Copenhagen Copenhagen, DK-1353 Denmark catalyzed by -ketoacyl synthase (KAS) enzymes. This reaction takes place in three steps (Figure 1), as follows: transfer of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) bound primer to the active site cysteine; decarboxylation of the donor substrate, malonyl-ACP, to give an ACP bound carbanion; and condensation of this carbanion with the enzyme bound primer substrate. While early studies educed results supporting the hypothesis that the Claisen condensation is a concerted reaction [1], subsequent work suggests a stepwise reaction is more likely [2­4]. Repetitive condensations yield long carbon chains like those characterizing fatty acids, polyketide antibiotics, flavonoids, toxins, and cell wall components such as waxes and mycolic acids. Most frequently, these condensing enzymes are components of multienzyme complexes that, in addition to the condensation reaction, activate the primer and donor substrates as well as prepare the growing carbon chain for the next elongation cycle. Varying the nature of the substrates, how they are activated, and which additional reactions take place between each condensation (Figure 1) results in the broad range of end products noted above from different biochemical pathways. Extensive variation within each type of end product (for example, fatty acids) is also possible. How this is achieved depends in part on the nature of the participating enzyme complex. Two basic types are known, those composed of one or two polyfunctional proteins coded for by the corresponding number of genes (type I) and those consisting of monofunctional proteins that are each encoded by discrete genes (type II). Different end products can be realized with type I complexes if additional monofunctional proteins are present; for example, a second thioesterase is capable of taking C8­C12 fatty acyl chains before they are completely elongated to C14­C18 from the rat fatty acid synthase (FAS) complex [5]. Isozymes of components in type II complexes with different substrate specificities also enable the synthesis of an array of end products. Best characterized are the three KAS isozymes contributing to synthesis of C16 and C18 carbon fatty acids in E. coli and plant plastids. KAS I, II, and III have overlapping substrate specificities. KAS III is specialized for the first step of elongation and uses a CoA-activated primer substrate, whereas KAS I and II use acyl carrier protein (ACP)-activated primer substrates (Figure 1). In plastids, KAS I extends C4 to C16 in six rounds of elongation, whereupon KAS II carries out an additional step to give C18. In the seeds of some plants, KAS proteins with 85% identity to KAS II, called KAS IV, are implicated in synthesis of intermediate chain lengths from C8 to C14 [6, 7]. Classic studies in E. coli infer that KAS I is unique in carrying out the first step of the unsaturated pathway (C10:1 to C12:1), whereas KAS II is unique in carrying out the last step of the unsaturated pathway (C16:1 to C18:1) [8]. The far

Summary Background: -ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS) I is vital for the construction of the unsaturated fatty acid carbon skeletons characterizing E. coli membrane lipids. The new carbon-carbon bonds are created by KAS I in a Claisen condensation performed in a threestep enzymatic reaction. KAS I belongs to the thiolase fold enzymes, of which structures are known for five other enzymes. Results: Structures of the catalytic Cys-Ser KAS I mutant with covalently bound C10 and C12 acyl substrates ° have been determined to 2.40 and 1.85 A resolution, respectively. The KAS I dimer is not changed by the formation of the complexes but reveals an asymmetric binding of the two substrates bound to the dimer. A detailed model is proposed for the catalysis of KAS I. Of the two histidines required for decarboxylation, one donates a hydrogen bond to the malonyl thioester oxo group, and the other abstracts a proton from the leaving group. Conclusions: The same mechanism is proposed for KAS II, which also has a Cys-His-His active site triad. Comparison to the active site architectures of other thiolase fold enzymes carrying out a decarboxylation step suggests that chalcone synthase and KAS III with CysHis-Asn triads use another mechanism in which both the histidine and the asparagine interact with the thioester oxo group. The acyl binding pockets of KAS I and KAS II are so similar that they alone cannot provide the basis for their differences in substrate specificity. Introduction Creation of new carbon-carbon bonds is an essential reaction in biochemistry. One mechanism by which this is accomplished is the Claisen condensation, a reaction

Figure 1. The Three-Step Mechanism Characterizing the Decarboxylating Claisen Condensing Enzymes The first step is a trans-thioesterification of the primer substrate. Subsequently, malonyl-ACP gets decarboxylated to give the carbanion, which then attacks C1 of the primer substrate, followed by release of the product, 3-oxoacyl-ACP.

greater efficiency of KAS II in accomplishing the latter step has been shown by the use of expressed proteins [9]. In both plant plastids and E. coli, the KAS I and II sequences show extensive homology, while KAS III sequences are more closely related to those of the polyketide chalcone synthase (CHS) enzymes [10, 11]. The occurrence of multiple KAS isozymes provides targets for different levels of regulation of fatty acid synthesis at the protein level. Thus, the different temperature sensitivities of KAS I and II form the basis for temperature regulation of fatty acid composition of E. coli membranes [8, 9, 12]. E. coli KAS isozymes are also differentially sensitive to apo-ACP, ACP, and acyl-ACPs ([13, 14]; McGuire et al., submitted). The potential for biotechnological manipulation of the end products by the pharmaceutical industry derives from differential sensitivities of the isozymes to antibiotics. KAS III, for example, is insensitive to cerulenin, whereas KAS I is highly sensitive and KAS II is moderately sensitive. Since in both cases cerulenin makes a covalent bond to the active site cysteine [15, 16] in the substrate binding site [17], other residues can significantly influence the binding. In Mycobacterium one KAS isozyme, KAS A, is specifically inhibited by the drug isoniazid, while other KAS isozymes and domains are not [18]. Recently published crystal structures [19­22] reveal that the three E. coli KAS isozymes are dimers, with each subunit showing an - - - - fold that forms a core domain from which a "capping domain" extends. This architecture closely resembles that of other enzymes that can carry out Claisen condensations, namely, the alfalfa chalcone synthase (CHS) [23, 24] and the peroxisomal thiolase (TLS) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [25, 26]; although, the biological function of the latter is to catalyze the reverse reaction. In the thiolase structure, the capping domain is in the form of a loop. Recently, a tetrameric (a dimer of dimers) biosynthetic thiolase from Zoogloea ramigera, whose dimers have analogous configurations to the peroxisomal thiolase, has been described [27, 28]. Thiolases, in contrast to KAS and CHS enzymes, do not decarboxylate the second substrate to give a carbanion (Figure 1) but instead

activate it by abstracting a proton therefrom. How the decarboxylating Claisen enzymes accomplish the condensation reaction at the molecular level has been gleaned recently from the structural analyses of CHS [23, 24] and KAS III [21, 22], which were accompanied in two cases by mutagenic data [22, 23]. Interestingly, three different catalytic models are presented for these two enzymes, whose catalytic sites include a Cys-HisAsn triad. We present here two structures for KAS I complexed with fatty acids having C10 and C12 long carbon chains. The analysis of these structures has led us to propose a model for the Claisen condensation mechanism, as carried out by E. coli KAS I, whose catalytic site differs from that of CHS and KAS III in having a Cys-His-His triad. Our hypothesis is in accord with the results of a mutagenic analysis of six highly conserved residues, including those of the catalytic triad ([29]; McGuire et al., submitted). The proposed KAS I mechanism, which is likely to also apply to KAS II, is compared to the three catalytic models for KAS III and CHS. This leads us to suggest that the decarboxylating Claisen enzymes can employ two different catalytic mechanisms, one based on the Cys-His-His triad and the other on a Cys-His-Asn triad.

Results Structures of the Complexes Studies have shown that the KAS I Cys163Ser mutant is able to bind a tetradecanoate substrate more efficiently (143%) than does the wild-type enzyme (100%) and is also able to maintain condensation activity ([29]; McGuire et al., submitted). Crystals of this mutant could be grown under the same conditions as those for the wild-type enzyme [19, 30]. We made KAS I complexes with the primer substrate by soaking these crystals with acyl-CoA, which is known to react with the enzyme. Soaking experiments were conducted with decanoylCoA (C10), dodecanoyl-CoA (C12), tetradecanoyl-CoA (C14), and palmitoyl-CoA (C16), and X-ray diffraction data were recorded on these crystals. The electron density maps that were calculated based on the measured data revealed that a fatty acid moiety had been bound as an ester to the Ser163 in the crystals soaked with decanoyl-CoA and dodecanoyl-CoA. Though the electron density around Ser163 showed that the tetradecanoyl-CoA soaking experiment had led to derivatization of KAS I in the crystal, the electron density around the acyl moiety was not as well-defined as in the other two complexes, and this finding indicated disorder or partial substitution in this complex. The electron density calculated from the data measured on the crystal soaked with palmitoyl-CoA did not contain any residual density close to Ser163, which made us conclude that the reaction had not taken place. Only the structures of KAS I decanoyl (KAS I­C10) and dodecanoyl (KAS I­C12) were completely refined (details are listed in Table 2), with KAS I­C12 being determined to the highest resolution ° (1.85 A). The crystal packing with two dimers per asymmetric unit does not change with formation of the fatty acid complexes, and the overall fold of the polypeptide chain

The A and B subunits are colored orange and turquoise, respectively. The figure was generated with Bobscript [49].

in the complexes is almost identical to that of the uncomplexed wild-type enzyme (Figure 2) [19]. The structure contains two dimers in the asymmetric unit, and in the uncomplexed structure noncrystallographic two-fold symmetry relates the subunits in both dimers. This noncrystallographic symmetry is not valid for the KAS I­C10 and KAS I­C12 complexes. The interactions for the fatty acid moiety differ in the two active sites within a dimer (vide infra). In the dimer comprised of subunits A and B, this asymmetry is well-defined. Substrate binding in the other dimer (C­D) seems obscured by disorder in the acyl binding pocket. This difference between the two dimers is probably due to differences in their crystalline environments. The subsequent description of the substrate binding will be based on the structure of the welldefined A-B dimer. The Acyl Binding Pocket The fatty acid is bound covalently as an ester to Ser(Cys)163 in KAS I­C10 and KAS I­C12, as illustrated in Figures 3a­b. In both structures, the oxo group is oriented to make hydrogen bonds to the main chain amides of Ser163 and Phe392, as previously predicted [31]. The acyl chain folds into an extended U-shaped conformation, implying that two of the central torsion angles of the fatty acid chain are in a syn conformation. This curved conformation can be attributed almost entirely to one single amino acid residue, Phe201, which points into the acyl binding pocket, thereby forcing the acyl chain to bend (Figures 3a and 3b). The environment of the C12 fatty acid chain (Figure 4) shows that the phenyl group of Phe392 is stacked on top of the ester ° group of Ser(Cys)163 in close contact ( 4.0 A) with carbon atoms 2 and 3 from the acyl chain. In a previous examination of the KAS II structure, it was suggested that the residue equivalent to Phe392 serves as a lid covering the electrophile and protects it from the solvent [17, 20]. Two methionine residues, one from each of the subunits in the dimer, delineate opposite sides of the KAS I substrate binding pocket. These residues are Met138B in contact with C5, C6, C7, and C8 of the acyl chain and Met197A in contact with C9 and C10. The first atoms of the fatty acid acyl chain are close to C and C of the completely conserved Ala162. In addition, Val134B appears to play a role in stabilizing the substrate environment, as it has van der Waals contacts with Phe201A, Phe392A, Glu200A, and C12 of the fatty acid. One of the most intriguing features of the binding

pocket is the well-defined polar/charged side chains of Gln113B and Glu200A, which were poorly defined in the structure of the apoenzyme [19]. In both KAS I­C10 and KAS I­C12, these residues are perfectly ordered in the A-B dimer and show unambiguously that the two fatty acids, one in each pocket of the homodimer, bind in an asymmetric fashion (Figure 5). This suggests that substrate binding is a sequential process. The orientation of Gln113A is almost the same as in the uncomplexed structure, with its O in contact with the carbonyl group of Ala137B and with the NH group of Ser109B via ° a water molecule. The N of Gln113A is 3.2 A from the carbonyl oxygen of Gly107A. In the KAS I­C10 complex, the backbone amide and O of Gln133B are hydrogen bonded to Glu200A O 2. The amide group of Gln133B is also within the hydrogen bond distance of Glu196A. In the KAS I­C12 complex, these distances are longer, and there are no obvious hydrogen bond partners for O of Gln133B. A shift in the position of the side chain of Glu200 represents one of the major differences between the two complexes. Glu200 moves away from the pocket to accommodate C11 and C12 of the fatty acid. Similar shifts in the positions of the side chains of a glutamine and a glutamate residue were observed in the medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase when the methyl group of the substrate was accommodated [32]. The Active Site The topology of the active site is almost identical to the one seen in the uncomplexed enzyme, although the loop containing Phe392 that connects C 4 and C 5 (residues ° 391­394) is shifted slightly (0.5 A) away from the active site access funnel. This enables the formation of a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Gly393A and the side chain of Asn156B. The catalytically active Ser(Cys)163 is located in the loop between N 3 and N 3, which is reminiscent of the nucleophilic elbow motif seen in the subfamily of / -hydrolases represented by human pancreatic lipase [33­35]. Two histidines point toward the nucleophile in the active site, as in the uncomplexed structure [19]. N of His298 is within hydro° gen bonding distance (3.2 A) of a water molecule (Wat942) that is hydrogen bonded to the nucleophile Ser163O . The difference electron density in each of the four subunits of KAS I­C10 and KAS I­C12 contains a characteristic feature (Figure 3c) close to the side of the His298 imidazole ring that faces away from the active site entrance. The electron density is continuous at 1 ; because of its shape and size, this density was initially

Structure 236

electron density invariably resulted in negative residual density around the central atom. The electron density could, however, be successfully modeled as two oxygen ° atoms separated by 2.5 A. A short O­O distance such as this represents a very strong hydrogen bond, which normally involves one charged group [36]. This led us to interpret the electron density in Figure 3c as a hydrox° ide ion and a water molecule linked by a short (2.5 A) hydrogen bond, with the hydroxide ion making another short hydrogen bond to the protonated N (O...N ° 2.5 A). Further stabilization of the negative charge of the hydroxide ion is achieved by the interaction with the conserved Lys328 (Figure 3c), the N -OH distance be° ing 3.1 A. In addition to the interaction with the hydroxide ion, the water molecule is hydrogen bonded to Ser389O and Glu342O . These latter interactions probably assist the hydroxide ion in moving toward C of the imidazole ° ring; the corresponding O...C distance is 2.8 A. A hydrogen bond from the Phe390 backbone oxo group to ° His298 C (O...C 3.0 A) is also observed. A similar interaction has been observed in the family of serine hydrolases in which C of the histidine that is acting as a general base makes a hydrogen bond to a backbone oxo group [38]. The other histidine in the active site, His333 (N ), is within hydrogen bonding distance of O of Ser(Cys)163. The hydrogen bonds formed between N and the backbone amide groups of Leu335 (in conformation) and Ser334 intimate that N of His333 is unprotonated and N is protonated.

Discussion Comparison to Related Structures KAS I adopts the thiolase type fold, and the crystal structures are known for six related enzymes, the yeast peroxisomal thiolase [25, 26], Z. ramigera biosynthetic thiolase [27, 28], alfalfa chalcone synthase (CHS) [23, 24], and KAS I, KAS II, and KAS III from E. coli [19­22]. These enzymes all manifest a dimer structure, except the biosynthetic thiolase that tetramerizes as a "dimer of dimers." The subunits within the dimer share the thiolase fold - - - - sandwich motif that appears to be the result of a duplication of a module consisting of a 5 strand sheet and three helices. Structurally, the modules are related by a pseudo two-fold axis [25]. The main structural differences between the family members lie in protrusions from the N-terminal core module. These regions outside the core domain, called the capping domain in KAS I, are involved in the binding of the substrate to be elongated and, in some cases, the dimerization. The KAS and CHS members of the thiolase fold family catalyze the three-step Claisen condensation reaction consisting of transfer, decarboxylation, and condensation (Figure 1). The yeast thiolase is a degradative enzyme catalyzing the breakdown of acyl coenzyme A (CoA) into acetyl-CoA units, and the biosynthetic thiolases catalyze the condensation of two acetyl-CoA units to yield acetoacetyl-CoA as well as the reverse reaction. In the following, we first present the catalytic mechanism revealed by the present work for KAS I and then compare

this mechanism to those proposed for KAS II, III, and CHS. Finally, the structural origins of substrate differences of KAS I and KAS II are considered. The KAS I Catalytic Mechanism The structures of KAS I complexed with covalently bound acyl substrates show one of the reaction's intermediate stages in which the acyl residue is ready for elongation. The oxo group of the bound fatty acid thioester is located in an oxyanion binding site defined by the backbone NH groups of Phe392 and Cys163 (Figure 4) ° with donor-acceptor distances of 3.0 and 2.9 A, respectively. This environment increases the electrophilic character of the acyl carbonyl carbon (C1) and thereby facilitates the attack of a carbanion. This same oxyanion binding site is likely to be used to activate the C1 carbon

for the initial transferase reaction (Figure 6a). Cys163 is situated at a topological switch point between strand N 3 and helix N 3. A superposition of N 3 with the helix of the nucleophilic elbow motif of serine hydrolases [35, 37] shows that the nucleophilic residues cysteine and serine, respectively, occupy equivalent positions at the tip of the helix and exploit the helix dipole moment. This appears to be the main contribution to the activation of the Cys163 nucleophile. Furthermore, both the dipole-induced nucleophile and oxyanion hole provide energetically favorable conditions for the acyl transfer process. An active site histidine has been suggested to play a role in the activation of the nucleophile by proton abstraction [11, 20]. In KAS I, His333 is within hydrogen ° bonding distance (3.0 A) of the nucleophilic Cys163. The other histidine in the active site (His298) is also interacting with the cysteine thiol via a water molecule. Mutant studies have shown that changing either histidine to alanine has a relatively modest effect (135% and 67%, respectively) on trans-thioesterification, whereas neither of the mutants exhibited malonyl decarboxylase activity ([29]; McGuire et al., submitted). A hydroxide ion forms short hydrogen bonds to His298 N and a water molecule (Figures 3c and 6b). Apart from ensuring protonation of N , these interactions make the N lone pair of the imidazole group ready for proton acceptance. A carboxylic acid moiety hydrogen bonded to N will lead to an arrangement around His298 that resembles the one in serine hydrolases, with the hydroxide ion mimicking the serine hydroxy group. A C-H--O interaction between histidine C H and a backbone carbonyl group has also been observed in the structures of serine hydrolases. In the KAS I complex structures, C H from His298 forms C-H--O

Figure 6. Schematic Illustration of the Mechanism for the Reactions Involved in the KAS I­Catalyzed Claisen Condensation (a) An acyl transfer involving a tetrahedral KAS I­fatty acid­ACP complex intermediate starts the reaction. (b) Malonyl-ACP is bound in the decarboxylase subsite, and decarboxylation is aided by the two histidines, His298 and His333, which interact with the leaving carboxylic acid group and the thioester oxygen, respectively. (c) The ACP bound acetyl carbanion attacks the thioester carbon of the bound fatty acid, and a second tetrahedral intermediate is formed prior to the release of the 3-oxoacyl-ACP product.

This enables N from His333 to make contacts to the thioester oxo group of the malonyl residue, and this contact induces a partial negative charge on that group. We propose that the effect exerted by the two histidine residues and the acidic nature of the malonyl C atom stimulate the decarboxylation reaction (Figure 6b). To further examine this suggested mechanism for the decarboxylation step, we modeled a malonate molecule with a thio acid group instead of the carboxylic group on C1 into the active site (Figure 7). It was positioned with its leaving carboxylic acid group in contact with His298 N and the oxo group of the thio acid hydrogen bonded to N from His333. C2 could be positioned to make a covalent bond to the fatty acid ester C1 by simple rotation around the thio acid O­S axis to ensure minimal or no movement of the phosphopantetheine moiety during catalysis. Thus positioned with no steric clashes, the leaving carboxyl group is within hydrogen bonding distance of threonines 300 and 302, and a bond connecting the sulfur to the pantetheine residue would point outward, away from the protein interior. The position of the sulfur atom results in the thioester oxo group being situated near the oxyanion binding site. Fatty acyl transfer and decarboxylation would thus require only one phosphopantetheine binding site. This model for malonyl binding is also in concord with the "dead end" binding site for malonyl in the absence of primer substrate proposed by Witkowski et al. [31] to explain the very low decarboxylase activity in the absence of substrate in wild-type mammalian FAS. These authors have proposed that the malonyl moiety gets trapped in the oxyanion binding site unless this site is already occupied by the primer substrate thioester oxo group. Models for the Catalytic Function of the KAS Enzymes Models for the catalytic mechanism derived from structural studies of CHS, KAS II, and KAS III with a strong focus on the decarboxylation reaction have been published recently [20­24]. Surprisingly, the only attribute that these models have in common is the interaction between a histidine residue equivalent to His333 in KAS I and the malonyl thioester oxo group. Bearing the model for the KAS I catalysis in mind, we will present the different models for the enzymatic function of the KAS enzymes. As an aid for the discussion, the active site architectures of the six thiolase fold enzymes are shown in
Figure 7. A Malonyl Thioester Modeled into the Active Site of KAS I The atoms of the malonyl group are shown in green, and its sulfur atom in light gray. The latter connects to the phosphopantetheine group, which is not modeled. Malonyl is positioned in what is believed to be the decarboxylation subsite. The thioester oxo group interacts with N of His333, OH of the carboxylic leaving group interacts with N from His298, and the carboxylic oxo group interacts with side chain O s from threonines 300 and 302. The figure was prepared with Molscript [50].

hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl groups of Phe390 and His298. Interactions of this type would contribute to the destabilization of the imidazole cation and thereby facilitate deprotonization of N [38]. This makes us believe that His298 acts as a general base by extracting a proton from the carboxylic acid leaving group of the malonyl residue. N of the other active site histidine, His333, accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone NH of Leu335, which implies that N is protonated.

Figure 8. Structures of the Active Sites in the Thiolase Fold Enzymes for Which Structures Have Been Published KAS I­C12 (present study, PDB code 1EK4), KAS II [20] (PDB code 1KAS), KAS III [21, 22] ( PDB codes 1D9B and 1EBL), CHS (alfalfa chalcone synthase) [23, 24] (PDB code1BI5), TLS (yeast peroxisomal thiolase) [25] (PDB code 1PXT), and BTLS (Zoogloea ramigera biosynthetic thiolase) [27] (PDB code 1DLU). Water molecules are not shown. Notice that the catalytic histidine residues of CHS (His303) and KAS III (His244) are closer to the catalytic Asn and to the nucleophilic cysteine sulfide than are the equivalent histidines in KAS I and KAS II. This residue is altogether missing in the thiolases, which do not have decarboxylase activity. The figures were prepared with Molscript [50].

Figure 8. Table 1 displays the equivalence between the active site residues and some general catalytic properties. Thiolases do not decarboxylate a malonyl residue to get the carbanion but abstract a proton from C2 of the acetyl group. This is reflected in their active site architecture, which differs substantially from the decarboxylating enzymes by having an additional catalytic cysteine (Figure 8) [25, 27]. Examination of the differences in the active site architecture of the KAS enzymes led to the deduction that two different catalytic mechanisms exist for decarboxylation (vide infra). CHS differs from the KAS enzymes by lacking the oxyanion hole, which, in the KAS I­substrate complexes, harbors the acyl oxo group. Phe392, which is donating a NH group to the oxyanion binding site in KAS I, is a proline (Pro375) in CHS. It was proposed that in this structure, the side chains of His303 and Asn336 create a different oxyanion binding site, which is used for the transfer as well as for the decarboxylase reaction [24]. Mutant studies support this suggestion to some extent, although the transferase reaction has not been

monitored separately. KAS III acyl transfer was suggested to occur via a tetrahedral intermediate with the thioester oxo group situated in the oxyanion pocket [22], as proposed above for KAS I. The mechanism for decarboxylation suggested for CHS [23, 24] resembles the one proposed by one of two independent groups for KAS III [22], in that the active site histidine and asparagine side chain NH and NH2 groups constitute an oxyanion binding site promoting decarboxylation by binding the malonyl thioester oxo group. In both CHS and KAS III, a phenylalanine, assumed to be in the vicinity of the leaving group, is suggested to interact with the carboxylate group to promote catalysis. This is supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies on CHS. This phenylalanine is proposed to be Phe215 of the same subunit in CHS [24] and Phe87 from the other subunit in the KAS III dimer [22]. KAS III also contains a phenylalanine (Phe157), which superimposes nicely with CHS Phe215, so the identity of the "catalytic" phenylalanine remains to be settled for KAS III.

The thiolases obviously differ from the other enzymes possessing the thiolase fold in that they lack decarboxylase activity and thus constitute a separate group within the family. The possibility exists that the remaining decarboxylating enzymes carry out the Claisen condensation by more than one mechanism. We suggest that they can be divided into two groups. This hypothesis is prompted by the observations that one of the active site residues differs (histidine  asparagine) and that the distance between the asparagine N and the histidine ° ° N in KAS III and CHS is 3.5 A and 3.8 A, respectively (Table 1). In KAS I and KAS II, the equivalent distance ° between the active groups on the histidines is 1 A longer. The closer distance in KAS III and CHS combined with the use of asparagine instead of one of the histidines could mean that the residues are optimized to form an oxyanion binding site. This is supported by the fact that the CHS active site mutant (His303Gln) is a functional decarboxylase [24]. This would not be the case if the histidine in the wild type were a general base (pKa for the protonated and deprotonated amides 0.5 and 17, respectively [39]). In addition, KAS III and CHS do not contain the structural/functional equivalent to Lys328. This lysine is highly conserved and involved in an interaction with the hydroxide ion that is necessary for the activation of His298 as a base catalyst. The catalytic role of this residue is supported by site-directed

mutagenesis experiments ([29]; McGuire et al., submitted). This leads us to suggest that the decarboxylating thiolase fold condensing enzymes are divided into two groups, the CHN group represented by CHS and KAS III and the CHH group represented by KAS I and KAS II. (CHH and CHN refer to the Cys-His-His and Cys-HisAsn triads, respectively). An alternative model for the KAS III catalytic mechanism in which His244 acts as a general base by subtracting the proton of the leavinggroup carboxylate [21], much like the catalytic model proposed in the present study for KAS I, is not in line with this two-group model. Substrate Specificity of KAS I and KAS II The synthesis of membrane fatty acids in E. coli differs from that in plastids in that a double bond is built into the growing chain during elongation in E. coli, whereas double bonds are inserted into the finished chain in plastids. In E. coli, the branch between synthesis of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids occurs at a carbon chain with ten carbon atoms. The major differences in the substrate profiles of KAS I and KAS II are that only the former allegedly elongates a cis-3 decanoyl (C10:1) primer, while only the latter elongates a cis-9 hexadecanoyl (C16:1) primer. Both carry out all elongations between C4 and C16 in the saturated pathway [8, 9]. The noted differences have been presumed to have a struc-

tural basis. We had anticipated clues to solving this puzzle from analyses of the structure of the KAS I­primer substrate complexes, especially with respect to the initiation of the unsaturated pathway by KAS I when it elongates C10:1. The architecture of the binding pockets of the two enzymes, however, is identical in the area proximal to the nucleophilic cysteine residue that binds the substrates. This is where one would expect KAS I and not KAS II to be able to harbor the double bond. Both saturated decanoyl and dodecanoyl substrates have an E configuration in this position, which can be readily modeled as a Z bond to resemble the cis bond without encountering any steric hindrance in either isozyme. This points to the possibility that acceptance or rejection of the C10:1 fatty acyl chain takes place before transfer from ACP. We have earlier suggested that the patch of positively charged side chains that delineate the active site entrance is involved in the specific ACP recognition [19]. That only KAS II elongates C16:1 to C18:1 is part of a more general question with respect to substrate specificity, namely, how the maximum length of a fatty acid that can fit into a binding pocket is determined. While preliminary soaking experiments with C16-CoA did not yield usable substrate­KAS I complexes, we have previously reported that KAS I can accept 16 carbon acyl chains as readily as 14 carbon ones in a transfer assay that measures the first step in the Claisen condensation [29]. This is in accord with the observation that E. coli, under conditions of glycerol starvation, synthesizes prominent amounts of C20:1, C18, and C20 as well as traces of C22 that are found among the free fatty acids [40]. This infers that either KAS I and/or KAS II has the ability to carry out as many as three additional elongation steps. The KAS I binding pocket seems to be effectively blocked at the dimer interface by the charged/ polar residues described. Contrarily, KAS II seems to be able to harbor longer substrates. Its binding pocket is hydrophobic and does not have an obvious end where the binding pockets meet on the dimer interface. Very recently, the replacement of two residues lining the substrate pocket of KAS II, one with a bulky phenylalanine, the other with a methionine with a longer hydrophobic chain, was shown to reduce dramatically the size of fatty acyl chains that could be elongated. This confirmed modeling predictions that the substrate binding pocket would be markedly reduced in size [41]. While this demonstrates very beautifully that such an approach may enable the plant oil biotechnologists to control the length of fatty acids synthesized in oil seeds, it does not help solve the puzzle of the structural basis of the KAS I and KAS II substrate specificity differences.

Biological Implications The creation of new carbon-carbon bonds is an essential reaction in biochemistry. One mechanism whereby this is accomplished is the Claisen condensation, which is utilized by enzymes having an - - - - or thiolase fold. This class of enzymes includes the thiolases, polyketide chalcone synthases, and -ketoacyl synthases that participate in the synthesis of, for example, cholesterol and

steroid hormones, polyketide antibiotics, flavonoids, toxins, fatty acids, and cell wall components such as waxes and mycolic acids. -ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS) I encoded by fabB in E. coli is vital for the synthesis of the saturated (C16) and unsaturated (C16:1 and C18:1) fatty acids that characterize the membrane lipids of E. coli. It is unique among KAS enzymes in its ability to carry out one of the first elongation steps in the unsaturated pathway, for which it most likely uses cis-3 C10:1 as a substrate. The presence of double bonds in the membranes increases their fluidity, allowing them to cope with decreases in temperature. That a double bond is introduced during elongation is in marked contrast to plants and mammals that insert double bonds into carbon chains after they are constructed. As a first step toward revealing the structural basis for the ability of KAS I to initiate synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, we have solved the structure of KAS I complexed with C10 and C12 fatty acids. The KAS enzymes share the same fold as the thiolase fold enzymes. The Claisen condensation is accomplished by more than one molecular mechanism, as evinced by the fact that the TLS enzymes do not decarboxylate, in contrast to the other thiolase fold enzymes that do so. Decarboxylation enables formation of the carbanion necessary for the condensation reaction to take place; TLS enzymes achieve the same by proton abstraction. We now propose that the decarboxylating Claisen enzymes employ two different catalytic mechanisms. Our structural studies of KAS I in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis [McGuire et al., submitted] have led to a detailed model for catalysis based on a Cys-His-His triad in the active site. Transfer of the fatty acid onto the active site cysteine is assisted by a nucleophilic elbow and oxyanion hole. Both histidines are required for decarboxylation; one donates a hydrogen bond to the malonyl thioester oxo group and the other abstracts a proton from the leaving group. This mechanism differs from that proposed for CHS and KAS III, which employ a Cys-His-Asn triad, in that decarboxylation is brought about by both the histidine and the asparagine contacting the thioester oxo group [22­24]. The thiolase fold enzymes are attracting increasing attention from the biotechnology industry. Two characteristics of KAS enzymes are being exploited, namely, their substrate specificities and differential sensitivities to antibiotics. For example, polyketide synthases in bacteria synthesize a diverse range of bioactive molecules. A combinatorial approach is being taken to produce novel antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents [42]. Transformation of KAS genes into plants is being pursued to enable production of new oils in agricultural crops [7]. Fatty acid synthesis can be specifically targeted in pathogenic bacteria causing tuberculosis and protozoan parasites causing malaria [43, 44]. Structure-based drug design is an avenue to more potent antibacterial and antiprotozoan agents. The knowledge provided from the structures of the KAS I complexes may prove very relevant for these investigations.
Experimental Procedures Protein Purification and Crystallization Purification and crystallization have been described in detail earlier [19, 30]. His-tagged protein was purified to homogeneity in two

steps by the use of a Ni-NTA resin column and an anion exchange column fractionation. To ascertain whether the sodium azide antibiotic used in the storage and crystallization media was present in the active site, we carried out decarboxylation assays as described (McGuire et al., submitted), except that wild-type and Cys163Ala KAS I proteins were pretreated with up to 800 nmol of sodium azide. Crystals were obtained at a protein concentration of approximately 12 mg/mL (calculated from absorption at 280 nm) in a hanging-drop experiment with 1.9 M (NH4)2SO4, 2% PEG 400, and 0.1 M bis-Tris-propane (pH 6.5). The resulting pH in the reservoir was 7.4. The crystals were soaked with different acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) species. All soaking experiments were performed with the target crystal(s) untouched in the drop in which they were grown. Five milligrams of acyl-CoA was dissolved in 100 L 20 mM bis-Trispropane (pH 6.5), and 1 L of this solution was added to the drop. Soaking times ranged from several hours to days. C12-CoA, C14CoA, and C16-CoA were purchased from Sigma, and C10-CoA was purchased from Fluka.

R after simulated annealing and individual B factor refinement were 19.6% and 17.3%, respectively. The KAS I­C10 complex model was built and refined from data ° in the resolution range 29.8­2.4 A in the same way as for the KAS I­C12 complex described above. The initial analysis of the KAS ° I­C14 structure was based on all reflections measured to 1.9 A resolution. The KAS I­C12 structure was used for initial phasing, with only the peptide part of the model being used. The same NCS restraints were employed as for KAS I­C12. Clearly, a fraction of the molecules in the crystal had bound C14, but the electron density did not enable modeling of a C14 acyl chain.

Data Collection Diffraction data for the KAS I complexes, KAS I­C12, KAS I­C14, and KAS I­C16, were recorded at beam line 711 at the MAX-Lab synchrotron in Lund, Sweden. A MAR345 detector system was used ° for the measurements performed with a wavelength of 0.983 A. As suitable cryoconditions could not be identified, the crystals were mounted in a glass capillary and cooled in a stream of N2 gas to 263 K. Typically, because of the rod-like appearance of the crystals, we collected data from both ends of a crystal to minimize radiation damage effects. DENZO and SCALEPACK [45] were employed in the processing of the data. Data for KAS I­C10 were collected on an RAXIS II imaging plate detector with CuK radiation from a rotating anode operated at 50 kV, 180 mA. The same data collection strategy and data processing was employed as described above for the synchrotron experiments. No change in space group symmetry (P 212121) occurred by the soaking experiments, and the unit cell dimensions of the complexes do not show any significant deviations from those of the uncomplexed enzyme (Table 2). Data collection statistics are presented in Table 2.

Model Building and Refinement The crystal structure of uncomplexed KAS I excluding water molecules was used for initial phasing of the amplitudes obtained from the diffraction pattern of KAS I­C12. All reflections measured to ° 1.85 A resolution were used (Table 2). Difference electron density clearly showed that each of the four independent KAS I subunits in the asymmetric unit had bound a fatty acid moiety stretching from the active site Ser(Cys)163 to Glu200 (Figure 3b). To examine the similarity of the four KAS I subunits, we initially treated them as independent molecules. After rigid body refinement and some local adjustments of the model with the graphics program TURBO [46], refinement was carried out by simulated annealing with the program CNS [48]. We applied initial anisotropic B factor correction to the ° 6­1.85 A data, bulk solvent correction, and maximum likelihood targeting by using amplitudes. The dodecanoic acyl moieties, which were covalently bound as an ester to each O of the 4 Ser163 residues, were included in the model. This model was refined by the use of noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints on the polypeptide part of the model only. Restraints were imposed on all the main chain and C atoms. Based on our assumption that the subunits were pairwise similar (subunit A similar to D, and B to C), side chain atoms were restrained. Neither the side chains of Gln113 or Glu200 nor side chains involved in crystal packing were restrained. Weak restraints were imposed on the remaining residues. The magnitude of the negative Rfree was used as a criterion for parameter fitting [47]. Water molecules were located with the peak search option in CNS. All peaks were inspected manually and modeled as water if the geometry was good, there was density in a 2Fobs Fcalc map above 1, and they had reasonable hydrogen bond interactions. The average ° B factor for water molecules is 23 A2. We introduced water molecules while closely observing the effect on Rfree [47]. A total of 779 water molecules were included in the model. The final values for Rfree and
