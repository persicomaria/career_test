Introduction
The geometric and electronic structures of the active sites in metallo-proteins play a central role in the biological function of these proteins.1­4 A role of particular importance is their ability to transport electrons over large distances and hence to catalyse many chemical reactions. The family of blue copper proteins show large variations in both active site geometry and redox properties depending upon the actual ligands bound to the copper centre and have been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies.5­10 Following the pioneering work of Solomon and coworkers increasingly sophisticated experimental and theoretical studies of these proteins have been carried out.11­13 These have revealed the importance of both metal­ligand coordination and the often quite subtle role of the protein environment in tuning the redox properties of the metal centre.6,14,15

The symbiotic interaction between experiment and theory in the study of the geometric and electronic structure of `small' gas phase molecules has led to advances in both these areas. For much larger molecules, particularly those of biochemical importance, there are still considerable problems both in obtaining high precision experimental data on well-characterised systems, and in modelling these systems to an acceptable level of accuracy. There have been, however quite rapid advances in both the experimental and computational treatment of systems up to the size of cupredoxins. Synchrotron radiation based protein crystallography is increas° ingly providing structures to atomic resolution (<1.2 A)16,17 providing sufficient accuracy to the structural data to test the capabilities of different theoretical approaches. In addition, hybrid or multi-level computational methods are now recognized to be capable of providing predictions of protein structure and reactivity which are also at a `chemical' level of accuracy.6,14,18,19 We here describe experimental and theoretical studies of the blue copper proteins, azurin, plastocyanin and stellacyanin. In all of these proteins a central copper atom is coordinated by three equatorial residues (two histidine and one cysteine), but differ in the number and type of the more weakly bound axial
 Atomic resolution is defined as the resolution at which the individual atoms of a carbon­carbon bond are resolved.

ligands, which are expected to contribute towards different redox properties. Azurin is five coordinate with glycine and methionine axial ligands. The proteins plastocyanin and stellacyanin are closely related to azurin, being four coordinate, with a single axial ligand, methionine and glutamine respectively. The three proteins display distinctly different redox properties, which are a consequence, at least in part, of the different axial ligands. Thus relative to plastocyanin, the redox potentials of azurin and stellacyanin are smaller, with that of stellacyanin being the smallest. Although the values of the redox potentials depend upon the actual protein, those of azurin and stellacyanin are about 70 and 115 mV smaller, respectively, than that of plastocyanin.5 Such differences have been attributed to the role of the axial ligands, in particular the extent to which they stabilize the higher oxidation state of the metal [Cu(II)]. Calculations on model compounds and small clusters have shown that hard ligands (Gln) can stabilize the higher oxidation state to a greater extent than a soft ligand (Met) and this explains the much larger redox potential of plastocyanin compared to stellacyanin.5 The extent of such stabilization will depend upon Cu­ligand bond lengths and this presumably is why azurin, which has both soft and hard axial ligands, has a redox potential between stellacyanin and plastocyanin. In addition to these direct effects of different ligands, there is the question of the extent to which the change in cluster geometry imposed by the enzyme environment, the entatic effect,8 has a role in modulating the redox properties. Thus, to understand quantitative differences in redox potential requires accurate structural data of both reduced and oxidized species, which might be obtained from either experiment or theory. Many structures of both the oxidized and reduced forms of these proteins have been reported using X-ray and EXAFS techniques15­17,20 and electronic structure studies of the active site, both in isolation and embedded in the protein environment have been performed.5,6,22,23 Azurin (see Fig. 1­3 later) has been the subject of several studies of this type5,9,21­26 and here the distances of the axial ligands from the copper atom are found to vary considerably in the different experimental structures. Crystal structures of oxidized and reduced stellacyanin (from horseradish) have also recently been reported.15 In understanding the role of the protein environment in tuning the redox potential, it is valuable to obtain estimates of the strain energy by comparing the energy of the active site in isolation and in the actual protein, which requires an accurate protein structure. A particular problem in estimating the strain energy of azurin has been identified by Ryde and Olsson,22 for when the geometry of the isolated cluster is optimized, the methionine and glycine ligands become unbound, requiring them to be fixed at the experimental distances from the copper atom in the actual protein. The reliability of the strain energy calculated in this way may thus depend upon the accuracy of these distances. It is therefore critical that these experimentally derived distances are obtained from structures at high or ultimately atomic resolution. In this paper we present new experimental and computational data on the structures of these three proteins. We first report the crystal structure of native azurin II from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans ° at 1.13 A resolution. This structure represents the highest resolution amongst a large number of azurin structures, and one of the highest in the family of cupredoxins. Further comparison has been ° carried out with our previous, lower resolution structure (1.75 A)

of azurin II and with EXAFS data. We also present electronic structure calculations for the three proteins, using models of the protein active site designed to clarify the relationship between the geometric structure around the active site and the redox properties. These calculations are of both the isolated cluster and the full protein, the latter using hybrid techniques which combine a high level quantum mechanical (QM) description of the active site, with a lower level molecular mechanical (MM) description for the rest of the protein.

Materials and methods
Crystallisation and data collection Azurin II from A. xylosoxidans was purified by methods described previously.20 Crystals were obtained using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method. Blue needle-like crystals grew in drops containing of protein solution (in 50 mM MES pH 6.0) and an equivalent volume of reservoir solution containing 15% PEG 4000 and 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5 at 21 C. Prior to X-ray diffraction studies, the crystal was soaked for 1 minute in a cryo-protectant solution consisting of 80% mother liquor with 20% glycerol and then flash cooled to 100 K in a liquid ° nitrogen cryo-stream. Data were collected to 1.13 A resolution using station 10.1 at the SRS, Daresbury Laboratory using a Mar ° CCD detector and an X-ray wavelength of 0.97 A. Data were processed using the program HKL200027 (Table 1).

azurin II was used as the search model. The correlation coefficient and the R factor associated with the single solution were 70.5% and 34.1% respectively. Initial refinement of the structure was carried out using the maximum-likelihood method in REFMAC5.29 Prior to refinement, 5% of the reflections (2566) were set aside for calculation of the free R factor. Manual rebuilding of the model was done using the molecular graphics program `O'.30 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps were generated using the CCP4 suite. Addition of solvent molecules was done using ARP/warp.31 Rigid body refinement was carried out on the initial model followed by positional and individual isotropic temperature factor ° refinement, using data in the resolution range 50.0 to 2.0 A. This yielded an R-factor of 22.8% (R-free 26.3%). Extension of the ° data to 1.13 A resolution, along with several refinement cycles and manual rebuilding of the model resulted in a further drop of the R-factor to 17.1% (R-free 20.6%). At this point anisotropic displacement parameters (ADP) were introduced which caused the R-factor to drop to 14.2% (R-free 16.9%) with the inclusion of 212 solvent molecules. Further refinement and the introduction of riding hydrogens continued in SHELX32 leading to a final R-factor of 12.8% (Rfree = 14.6%). Refinement statistics are summarised below in Table 1. During the refinement, no restraints were applied to the copper­ligand bond distances. The model was checked for stereochemical quality using PROCHECK,33 OOPS34 and WHATIF.35 Computational details We have studied both the isolated active site of each protein, using density functional theory (DFT), and the protein itself, using a hybrid or multilevel model combining a DFT description of the active site, with a MM description of the remainder of the protein, (QM/MM method). In all QM calculations we have chosen to use the BP86 functional with 38% Hartree­Fock exchange added, as suggested by Szilagyi et al.,36 in conjunction with TZV* and 6-31G* basis sets for copper and the remaining atoms. This combination was found to give a good description of the electronic structure of [CuCl4 ]2- . We have used two variants of the hybrid QM/MM model, depending upon whether or not the MM region polarizes the QM region via the effective point charges on the MM atoms. These methods, with or without such polarization are termed electronic embedding (EE) and mechanical embedding (ME) respectively.37,38 The QM/MM calculations were carried out employing the ONIOM scheme as implemented in GAUSSIAN0339 using the AMBER force field40 for the MM region. Our computational procedure is to take the appropriate crystal structure, solvate it with a large number (5000) of TIP3P41 water molecules, and relax the protein using the AMBER force field augmented with the copper parameters developed by Comba and Remenyi.42 In the QM/MM calculations, the QM region consisted of the copper atom and the four or five ligands coordinated to it. Thus for azurin, the [Cu(Im)(ImCH2 CH2 NHCOCH3 )(SCH3 )(S(CH3 )2 ] (Im = imidazole) cluster was taken as the QM region and was described at the DFT level of theory. Here the cysteine, histidine and glycine are partitioned as follows. Cys112 is terminated between Cb and Ca bonds (SCH3 ), His117 and Met121 are partitioned between Cc and Cb bonds [Im and S(CH3 )2 ]. His46 is terminated between Ca This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006

and C, and the weakly coordinated adjacent Gly45 is partitioned between Ca and N. The backbone of His46 and the adjacent glycine are connected (ImCH2 CH2 NHCOCH3 ). The QM/MM partitioning of azurin is shown in Fig. 1(a). A similar partitioning was used for stellacyanin [Cu(SCH3 )(Im)2 (NH2 COCH2 CH3 )] and plastocyanin [Cu(SCH3 )(Im)2 (S(CH3 )2 )], and is also shown in Fig. 1. All the atoms in the QM region, together with the neighbouring MM

Results and discussion
Crystal structure of azurin II at atomic resolution The crystal structure of azurin II from A. xylosoxidans has been ° ° ° previously reported at 2.5 A, 1.9 A and 1.75 A resolution.20,43,44 Here, we report the first atomic resolution structure of this protein and in fact the first atomic resolution structure of an azurin. Co-ordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession codes 2ccw and r2ccwsf ° respectively. The refined 1.13 A structure is of the reduced form of the protein and contains 1 molecule in its asymmetric unit, comprising 129 protein residues, 217 water molecules and 1 copper atom. A total of 15 residues were modelled with alternate side chain conformations; this included the first three residues at the N-terminus for which alternate conformations of the main chain were also observed. Even at this resolution some atoms in the side chains of residues on the surface of the protein were not clear in the electron density maps and were assigned an occupancy ° of zero. The determination of the azurin II structure to 1.13 A allowed the refinement of individual anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) for all atoms. Structures at atomic resolution are expected to have a mean anisotropy of 0.4­0.5 on a scale where 1 is perfect isotropy and where extremely anisotropic atoms approach an anisotropy of 0. The mean anisotropy of the structure was calculated to be 0.52 for protein atoms and 0.71 for solvent atoms. The anisotropy of the copper atom was 0.69. The mean calculated anisotropy for the amino acids of the copper site was 0.64 indicating significantly less anisotropic nature than the overall protein molecule (0.52) almost reaching that of the Cu atom itself (0.69). The stereochemistry of the model is summarised in Table 1. The atomic resolution crystal structure collected at 100 K ° presented here is isomorphous with the previous 1.75 A resolution oxidised and reduced structures collected at room temperature.20 A reduction in the unit cell volume was observed which arises from the slight variation in the unit cell dimensions (a = 51.75, b = 51.75 ° and c = 99.8 A for the current structure and a = 52.65, b = 52.65 ° ° and c = 100.63 A for the 1.75 A structures). This corresponds to a 4.3% reduction in unit cell volume between room temperature and 100 K. ° ° Comparison of the 1.13 A and 1.75 A structures by superposition of the equivalent carbon a atoms revealed an RMS positional

° difference of 0.77 A. The N- and C-termini deviated significantly between the structures contributing considerably to the overall r.m.s. positional difference. Residues 21­28, 41­44, 65­71, 75­ 76, 101­105 and 114­121 (with the exception of His 117) were also found to have relatively high RMS deviation between the structures. As the gene sequence of azurin II in A. xylosoxidans is not yet known, the sequence was derived experimentally by the method of Sanger et al.45 In this sequence, residue 19 was glutamic acid. According to the electron density maps of the current structure however, this residue is shown to be alanine. Sequence similarity searches revealed that out of a total of 26 azurin sequences with sequence similarity greater than 50% to A. xylosoxidans azurin II, position 19 was occupied by glutamic acid in eight while alanine was present in nine. In view of the high ° quality of the electron density at 1.13 A resolution, we assign this residue to be alanine in azurin II. The first three residues at the N-terminus exhibited a dual conformation of the protein main chain. The side chain of the fourth residue (Glu 4) was also modelled in two conformations. In total, the side chains of twelve residues were modelled with alternate conformations. Notably, methionines 13, 44 and 120 occupy multiple conformations and are part of the hydrophobic patch surrounding His117 that is believed to be important in complex formation with nitrite reductase, the redox partner to azurin II. The copper site In the copper site of azurin II, the Cu atom is coordinated to ° three strong ligands at 2 A, namely His46 Nd1 , His117 Nd1 and c Cys112 S arranged in a distorted trigonal planar geometry, Fig. 2, Table 3. The coordination geometry is completed by two other, weaker, ligands, Gly45 O and Met121 Sd in axial positions. Fig. 2 shows the electron density of the copper site. The B factors of ° the copper ligands were 11.4, 10.1, 9.7, 10.1, 10.1 and 11.6 A2 for Gly45 O, His46 Nd1 , Cys112 Sc, His117 Nd1 and Met121 Sd ° respectively. The Cu atom had a B factor of 11.2 A2 . The copper site was also analysed in terms of its anisotropic nature. Thermal ellipsoids at the 50% probability level are shown in Fig. 3 for all of the non-hydrogen atoms at the copper site. Copper and its ligands are significantly more isotropic than the rest of the protein as indicated in the discussion of the mean anisotropic values above. No reducing reagent was added to the protein. However, the rapid loss of the intense blue colour of the crystal during X-ray data collection suggested that photo-reduction of the copper ion had occurred due to the high intensity of the X-ray beam, resulting in Cu(I). The oxidation state of Cu was confirmed by comparison ° of the Cu­Cys112S bond length (2.21 A) in the crystal structure ° ° with EXAFS values46 for reduced (2.19 A) and oxidised (2.12 A) azurin. ° The copper site was compared with that in the 1.75 A structure of reduced azurin II. Superposition of the copper ligands revealed only a small overall difference with a calculated r.m.s. positional ° difference of 0.08 A for the backbone atoms, Fig. 4. This is ° comparable with the accuracy of the 1.75 A structure (ESU of ° 0.09 A). There were however, some considerable differences in ° the metal­ligand distances in the atomic resolution and 1.75 A structures.

Three dimensional EXAFS metrical data have also been reported for azurin II46 which showed that significant structural changes occurred in the copper site of azurin II between the two oxidation states. This difference was not observed in the ° 1.75 A structures of oxidised and reduced azurin II.20 The authors ° concluded that a resolution of 1.75 A was too low for any structural differences between azurin II in the two oxidation states to be distinguished. Although no structure is available at atomic resolution for the oxidised form of the protein, the high accuracy of the crystallographic information for the reduced protein presented here can be used to demonstrate whether the limited resolution of the earlier structures was the main reason for the significant differences between EXAFS and crystallographic data obtained ° at 1.75 A by Dodd et al.20 The largest difference between EXAFS parameters and the crystal structure was observed for the Gly45 O­Cu distance. In the ° ° ° 1.75 A crystal structure this was 2.75 A which was 0.23 A shorter ° than the distance calculated from the EXAFS data (2.98 A). In the ° case of the 1.13 A structure, the difference in bond lengths between ° ° crystal structure and EXAFS is only 0.04 A (2.94 A). In the case of the Met121 Sd­Cu and His46 Nd1 ­Cu distances the higher resolution structure did not result in any significant improvement of the agreement between the crystallographic and the EXAFS parameters (see Table 3). Finally, the distance calculated between ° the Cu atom and the nitrogen of His117 for the 1.13 A structure was in perfect agreement with that determined from the EXAFS ° analyses (2.01 A). It should be noted that the calculated error ° limits of the EXAFS values were ±0.02 A for the Cu­N(His) and ° Cu­S(Cys) and ±0.05 A for the Cu­O(Gly) distance. The S(Met) ligand did not contribute significantly to the EXAFS spectrum.46

Theoretical simulations of the active sites Azurin We first discuss the DFT calculations on the isolated cluster. As found by Ryde and Olsson,22 attempts to optimize the geometry of the cluster resulted in a lack of binding of the two weakly coordinated methionine and glycine ligands. It was found that if the Met121 Sd­Cu and Gly45 O­Cu distances were constrained at ° ° the experimental values reported here (3.26 A, 2.94 A), then the positions of the remaining ligands could be optimized (Table 4), the experimental Cys112 Sc­Cu and His46 Nd1 ­Cu distances are in excellent agreement with our data, but the predicted His117 Nd1 ­Cu distance is a little too long. With the same geometric constraints imposed, the structure of the oxidized form was optimized (Table 4). We find bond length reductions of about ° 0.1 A compared to the reduced state, for the three ligands which were allowed to move. In contrast to the isolated cluster calculations, the QM/MM model allows for the geometry optimization of both the QM region as well as the surrounding residues described at the MM level. As expected, it is the bond lengths of the weakly bound axial ligands that are more sensitive to the actual two-level model (ME or EE). Indeed, for the reduced form, the Cys112 Sc­Cu and the His46 Nd1 ­Cu lengths are essentially the same as those found in the isolated cluster. When comparing our calculated structures of reduced azurin (Table 4) with the experimental structures (Table 3), we do predict the rather longer Cys112 Sc­Cu This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006

showed that Gly45 had the largest r.m.s positional difference of all the residues in the copper site. Comparison of the corresponding angles between the copper atom and its ligands showed minimal differences--six out of ten angles have been decreased with the largest decrease being observed for the Gly45 O­Cu­Met121 Sd angle (4 ). Of the remaining four angles, there was no change for two of these while the His46 Nd1 ­Cu­Cys112 Sc and Cys112 Sc­ Cu­Met121 Sd angles increased by 2 and 5 respectively.

° distance found in the new 1.13 A resolution structure. However, d1 our value for the His117 N ­Cu distance is significantly longer ° than the experimental value, the latter (2.01 A, Table 3) being ° shorter than the reported experimental values (2.1 A) for reduced plastocyanin and stellacyanin (Table 5). For these two proteins, ° QM/MM calculations predict a shorter (2.1 A) Cu­N (His87 in plastocyanin and His94 in stellacyanin) distance compared to ° azurin (2.25 A), which is not unexpected. As far as the two weakly bound ligands are concerned, the Gly45 O­Cu distance is now shorter, and the Met121 Sd­Cu is larger, than experiment by about ° the same amount (0.2 A). This divergence between calculation and experiment is not surprising for the weakly bound ligands. Ryde found a very large extension of the second Cu­N bond length ° (to 2.65 A), when the protein environment was allowed to relax, which did not occur when the MM region was held fixed.22 Our results are in line with this, for we have only allowed a part of the protein environment to relax. As far as the bond angles are concerned, all models, both the free and embedded clusters give an essentially planar structure for the three atoms of the equatorial This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006

ligands bonded to the copper, in agreement with the experimental structure, although the actual bond angles do vary depending upon the model employed. We have also optimized the structure of the oxidized form of azurin, including the effect of the protein environment in the ME and EE models. For the isolated cluster, upon ionization, there is a significant reduction in the three copper­ligand bond lengths which were allowed to vary. For the embedded models, these bond length changes are generally smaller. Indeed, for the two weakly bound ligands the bond length changes are also quite small. These small changes for the embedded clusters are reflected in the considerably reduced reorganization energies compared to the isolated cluster. The pattern of shorter bond lengths in the oxidized copper site is consistent with earlier EXAFS data20,46 (Table 3). In the predicted structures of both the reduced and oxidized forms we see an interplay between the equatorial and axial bond lengths. Thus, the equatorial bonds lengthen or shorten when the axial interactions are respectively increased or decreased. The Dalton Trans., 2006, 3067­3076 | 3073

quite small bond length changes reported (Table 5) between the isolated and embedded cluster can be attributed to fixing the positions of the axial ligands in the isolated cluster model. It is of interest to compare the relative energies of the structures obtained from experiment, and from the isolated and embedded cluster calculations. To allow this comparison to be made the positions of all the hydrogens in the experimental structure were optimized at the QM level. We find that the optimized gas phase ° structure is 13.0 kcal mol-1 lower in energy than the 1.13 A resolution crystal structure reported here. However, the structures from the QM/MM calculations are only 0.9 and 1.5 kcal mol-1 lower in energy than the experimental one, these values being for the EE and ME models respectively. The small energy difference between the QM/MM and experimental structures shows that the potential energy surface for these strained structures is really quite flat in the region of the experimental geometry. We have made a similar comparison with previously published azurin structures at lower resolution than that reported here, ° ° ° both of oxidised (1DYZ-1.75 A, 4AZU-1.90 A, 1E5Y-2.00 A and ° ° 1AZU-2.70 A)20,48,49 and reduced protein (1DZ0-1.75 A).20 There is a trend for the lower resolution structures to give considerably higher energies than the higher resolution structures. For example, ° ° for the oxidized state, the 1.90 A and 2.70 A resolved structures -1 are respectively, 12.9 and 63.8 kcal mol higher in energy than the ° 1.75 A structure. Plastocyanin and stellacyanin In view of the very similar structures of azurin given by both the EE and ME models we describe only EE results from this point onwards. In our QM/MM calculations, we have used the highest resolution structures of oxidized plastocyanin from Populus nigra ° (PDB code: 1PLC, 1.33 A)47 and stellacyanin from Cucumis sativus ° (PDB code: 1JER, 1.60 A)50 as starting models. The optimized geometry of the copper sites of both the oxidized and reduced states of both proteins are shown in Table 5. The structures of both the isolated and embedded cluster have Cu­ligand bond lengths for the equatorial ligands which are in generally good agreement with both X-ray structures and previous computational studies.23,48 The axial bond lengths are however, substantially different in the two models. For plastocyanin, the Met92 Sd­Cu axial bond in the vacuum model is much shorter for both oxidation states than the values for the embedded model, which show good agreement with the X-ray values (Table 5) For both the reduced and oxidized forms of stellacyanin, the isolated cluster and embedded models predict quite different Gln99 O­Cu distances with the embedded model being in good agreement with experiment. We see that the computed geometry of stellacyanin for both oxidation states, using the embedded model, shows reasonably good agreement with the latest published crystal ° structures at 1.90 A resolution, (stellacyanin from horseradish) Table 5.15 The major bond length changes which occur upon inclusion of the protein backbone are for the axial ligand­Cu distances (particularly in reduced stellacyanin), and these are again mirrored in smaller changes in the corresponding distances for the equatorial ligands. It is again useful to compare the relative energies of the clusters from experiment and from the QM/MM model in each species. As we found for azurin, these values are quite small being 3­5 kcal mol-1 for both stellacyanin

and plastocyanin, again reflecting the accuracy of the embedded method. Prediction of redox potentials The calculation of the absolute value of the redox potential of proteins presents formidable difficulties, which largely centre around the sampling of the many possible configurations of the protein and the evaluation of the associated entropy. For this reason it is usual to compute differences in redox potential between similar proteins,5 using simplified models in the hope that such entropic terms, and perhaps other effects, such as the differential solvation of the two oxidation states, will effectively cancel. In one attempt to predict the absolute redox potential of a blue copper protein, experimental data were used to estimate entropic contributions to the redox potential.6 The problem is further accentuated by the quite small differences in redox potential, of the order of 100 mV, which we are trying to understand. In this paper we are mainly concerned with active site structures, and we wish to see if the trends in the redox potentials can be predicted in terms of the measured and predicted structural changes at the active site. In the following discussion, we thus equate the redox potential as the adiabatic electron detachment energy (ADE). This quantity, and the corresponding vertical energy (VDE), are given in Table 6. The corresponding reorganization energies are comparable with those reported by Ryde et al.22,51 for both vacuum clusters and the embedded clusters. The slightly smaller reorganization energy that we find for plastocyanin compared to stellacyanin is in line with the faster electron transfer found for a type 1 copper site with an axial Met, rather than a Gln ligand.52 Both the isolated and embedded cluster models predict the same trend in the relative values of the redox potentials for stellacyanin and plastocyanin and also give a quantitative difference in reasonable agreement with experiment. The considerably smaller value for stellacyanin is due to the short Gln99 O­Cu distance in the oxidized state which is predicted by both the free and embedded cluster models and consistent with experimental data. Our QM/MM calculations (Table 7) predict that azurin and

stellacyanin have respective redox potentials that are 217 and 187 mV lower than plastocyanin, the corresponding values for the isolated cluster being 269 and 152 mV. To investigate the effect of using different experimental active site structures to predict these redox potentials, we have taken structures (1X9R, 1X9U of stellacyanin and 1DYZ, 1DZ0 of azurin II) at comparable resolution for the oxidized and reduced states, optimized the positions of the hydrogen atoms and evaluated the redox potentials for these structures. Again, the value for azurin is less than that of stellacyanin (by 303 mV). Full relaxation of these structures, whilst maintaining the Cu­ligand lengths at the experimental values, changes this value only slightly (to 330 mV). Such differences in redox potential are of similar magnitude to the difference in energy between the clusters from experiment and from the QM/MM model. In this respect we note that better agreement between the calculated and experimental redox data is obtained when the initial structures used for the QM/MM calculations and redox data are for the same species (Table 7) This highlights the need for both high resolution crystallographic structures and redox data for the same species.

Conclusions
The crystal structure of fully reduced native A. xylosoxidans ° azurin II has been solved at 1.13 A resolution. This is the highest resolution structure of any azurin and one of the highest in the family of cupredoxins and thus provides very accurate data for the cupredoxin fold, which is also found in several multi-copper ° proteins. Comparison with the lower resolution 1.75 A reduced azurin II structure revealed some significant differences illustrating the significance of atomic resolution structural information in understanding protein structure and function. Three of the residues (all methionines) that have been modelled in alternate conformations are part of the hydrophobic patch surrounding His117, which is believed to be important in complex formation with the redox partner nitrite reductase. Further comparison with three-dimensional EXAFS data shows an overall better agreement ° than with the earlier 1.75 A resolution crystal structure. We have used this new structure, together with published structures of oxidised and reduced plastocyanin and stellacyanin to assess the accuracy of QM/MM methods for structure prediction. The new high resolution structures certainly show that the QM/MM model we have used does not predict structures to the level of accuracy given by comparable gas phase calculations. However, we do find that the predicted structures are within a few kcal mol-1 of the experimental structures, and that the corresponding potential energy landscape is quite flat, making accurate structure prediction more difficult. We have found that the relative values of the redox potentials of the three proteins can be predicted within 100 mV (2 kcal mol-1 ) by considering only the electronic energy of the cluster optimized in the protein environment. To pin-point the origin of this small discrepancy is a formidable computational challenge, but it is useful to examine here the effect of strain energies on the redox potential. The atomic resolution structure we have reported allows direct comparison with the structures predicted from different computational models and also allows values for the strain energy (Table 8) to be obtained. These models highlight the importance of the protein environment in determining the position of the axial This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006

ligands, and show that the embedded model is appropriate for these simulations. We have evaluated strain energies, comparing the gas phase cluster energy with that of both experimental and QM/MM clusters. We see that the strain energy can vary by up to 5 kcal mol-1 for each protein state, and that for all three proteins the strain energy is larger in the reduced than in the oxidized state. However, the relative redox potentials depend on the way in which the difference between the strain energy in the two oxidation states varies in the three proteins. We find that this difference can vary by 4 kcal mol-1 , depending on the origin of the cluster structure. This value is close to the difference in the redox potentials of the three blue copper proteins studied here, and thus highlights that it is essential to have high resolution active site structures, either from experiment or computation, in order to identify the structural and other factors which contribute to the redox potential.
