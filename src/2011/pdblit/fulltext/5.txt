Preparation of Hemerythrin and Derivatives: The method of purification of hemerythrin was essentially that previously described (Florkin, 1933 and Klotz, 1957). The material prepared by these procedures had an iron content of 0.81% and an extinction coefficient of 3400 cm-liter mole-l at 330 rnp. These values are identical with those reported by others (Klotz et al., 1957; Nagy and Klotz, 1965). -The 280/330 ratio was 5.64 as previously reported (Love, 1957). Apohemerythrin was prepared by the procedure of Groskopf et -- al. (1966). Preparation Complex. Histidine HCl, 6 mmoles -of Iron-Histidine was dissolved in 20 ml of water. To this solution was added 2 mmoles of ferric ammonium sulfate. Fifty ml of ethanol was added to this mixture with a resultin separation of a red oil which crystallized on 8 standing overnight at 4 . The solid was recrystallized from waterethanol and dried under vacuum at 60°.

The reagent for assay of free histidine rzes, 5-diazo1-H-tetrazole (DHT), was prepared from 5-amino-l H-tetrazole according to the method described by Horinishi et al., (1964). The solution of DHT was added to the protein -in a 200 fold excess. The reaction was carried out in 1.0 M bicarbonate buffer pH 8.8. The exact conditions are indicated in the figure legends . The proteir-DHT complex was freed of excess DHT by dialysis against 0. 1 M bicarbonate buffer. Excess DHT was freed from the histidine-iron-DHT complex by chromatography on DEAE cellulose. Separation was achieved by elution with a saturated sodium chloride solution. The number of moles of DHT-histidine complez formed was calculated from the extinction coefficient of 1.74 x 10 cm liter moles' at 480 rnF (Horinishi et al., (1964). -Reaction with Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid. The number of free lysine groups was determmed by reaction the protein with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Routinely, the reaction was performed so that the final concentration was 1 x 10m5 M in protein and 5 x 10-4 M in TNBS in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at O". Excess TNBS was removed by dialysis before the spectra were recorded. An extinction coefficient of 1.2 x lo4 cm liter mole-l at 345 mp was used in the calculation of the number of groups reacting (Habeeb, 1966). Protein Measurement. The hemerythrin concentration was determined from the extinction coefficient of 3400 cm-liter mole- 1 at 330 rnp (Nagy and Klotz, 1965). Apoprotein concentration was determined by a microbiuret assay (Goa, 1953). All spectral measurements were recorded on a Cary 14 spectrophotometer. ,
