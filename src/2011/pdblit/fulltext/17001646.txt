ABSTRACT L-aspartate-a-decarboxylase (ADC) is a critical regulatory enzyme in the pantothenate biosynthetic pathway and belongs to a small class of self-cleaving and pyruvoyl-dependent amino acid decarboxylases. The expression level of ADC in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was confirmed by cDNA analysis, immunoblotting with an anti-ADC polyclonal antibody using whole cell lysate and immunoelectron microscopy. The recombinant ADC proenzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtbADC) was overexpressed in E. coli and the protein struc° ture was determined at 2.99 A resolution. The proteins fold into the double-w b-barrel structure. The subunits of the two tetramers (there are eight ADC molecules in the asymmetric unit) form pseudo fourfold rotational symmetry, similar to the E. coli ADC proenzyme structure. As pantothenate is synthesized in microorganisms, plants, and fungi but not in animals, structure elucidation of Mtb ADC is of substantial interest for structure-based drug development.

INTRODUCTION Tuberculosis, the debilitating disease caused by the bacterial agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, taking a toll of two million people annually. The Mtb cell wall is of unusually low permeability, a fact that contributes directly to its resistance to therapeutic agents. This bacillus augments its peptidoglycans with an enormous array of complex lipidoglycans.1 This unusual emphasis on lipids is reflected in the genome sequence of the bacterium. Up to 30% of Mtb genes are devoted to lipid synthesis or degradation. Lipid biosynthesis and metabolism have been shown to have a pivotal role in intracellular replication and persistence and is essential for the virulence of Mtb.2­4

Coenzyme A and the acyl carrier protein (ACP) play important roles as acyl-group carriers in fatty acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, biosynthesis of polyketides, and several other reactions associated with intermediary metabolism.5 The ACP enzyme shuttles a nascent fatty acid and polyketide chains through the use of the coenzyme A derived 40 -phosphopantothenyl moiety. The ACP, synthesized as an inactive apo-protein, is converted into an active holo-enzyme by the addition of the 40 -phosphopantothiene arm by the enzyme acyl carrier protein synthase (ACPS). The immediate precursor of 40 -phosphopantothiene is pantothenate, a product of the condensation reaction between D-pantoate and b-alanine. The source of b-alanine depends on an organism. Bacteria, plants, and fungi synthesize pantothenate from amino acid intermediates, whereas it is a nutritional requirement in higher animals, including human. L-aspartate-a-decarboxylase (ADC, EC 4.1.1.15),6 encoded by the panD gene, catalyzes the conversion of L-aspartate to b-alanine and provides the major route of b-alanine production in bacteria. ADC contains a pyruvoyl group, which is necessary for carrying out catalysis. The protein is initially translated as an inactive p-protein, and undergoes intramolecular self-cleavage by nonhydrolytic serinolysis at Gly24-Ser25, a reaction that is also known as N?O acyl shift. The cleavage7 results in formation of the b-chain (2.8 kDa with XÀ ÀOH at the C-terminus) and the a-chain (11 kDa with a pyruvoyl group at the new amino terminus). The catalytic function of ADC depends on the pyruvoyl group

formed as a result of self-processing.8 The complete mechanism that triggers the cleavage of the p-protein still remains unaddressed. Ramjee et al.7 have suggested that the cleavage of the p-protein is an autocatalytic process and autocatalysis does occur, as has been shown by our temperature and time course experiments using the uncleaved protein.9 Albert et al.10 have explained a feasible regulatory mechanism in their E. coli ADC (EcoADC) crystal structure. We have determined the crystal structure of the unprocessed native precursor ADC protein of M. tuberculosis (MtbADC). Comparison of structural features shows similarity to those in other self-processing systems. The crystal structure of MtbADC opens another important gateway in the development of drugs against M. tuberculosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Purification and Crystallization Recombinant MtbADC was expressed and purified in E. coli as described previously.9 The MtbADC protein with a His-tag was expressed in a soluble form by induction of mid-log phase cultures (OD600 ¼ 0.6­0.7) with 0.5 mM IPTG at 378C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice, resuspended in buffer A [10 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.8% NaCl], and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 18,000g for 30 min at 48C. The supernatant was collected and applied onto a 5 mL Niþ2-NTA column that had already been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was extensively washed with buffer A and eluted with two bed volumes of 250 mM imidazole in buffer A. The presence of aspartate decarboxylase was detected by 15% SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the purified protein were pooled and the protein was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and concentrated using YM-5 concentrators (Vivascience, UK). The protein was further purified using a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer B [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.15M NaCl]. The purified MtbADC protein was eluted as a tetramer. Purity was estimated to be more than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. MtbADC was crystallized by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method. The precipitant solution consisted 0.1M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 1.5M magnesium sulfate, and 20% w/v PEG 2000. Crystals of average size 0.05 3 0.1 3 0.1 mm3 appeared within 15 days. The crystals were rapidly swept through mother liquor containing 20% v/v glycerol as a cryo-protectant and were flash-cooled with liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Structure Determination Data collection on the crystals of MtbADC was performed at À1708C on beamline X-12B of the NSLS synchrotron, USA. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK.11 Subsequent data manipulation was carried out with the CCP4 software ° suite.12 Even though the crystal diffracted to about 2.8 A,

° reflections beyond 2.99 A were of poor quality. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the MOLREP program13 and the EcoADC structure (PDB code: 1PPY) as the probe. The crystal was later found to be hemihedrally twinned (the twinning fraction ¼ 0.401). The asymmetric unit contains eight molcules (a dimer of tetramers). Model building was performed using the program O.14 The structure was refined using the CNS program15 with NCS restraints. The model was checked for stereochemical correctness using the programs PROCHECK16 and WHAT_CHECK.17 The percentages of residues in the most favored, additional allowed and generously allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot are 77, 18, and 1, respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structural Overview We have determined the crystal structure of MtbADC ° by molecular replacement and refined at 2.99 A resolution. MtbADC (MW ¼ 15,950 Da) does not share significant amino acid sequence identity with the rest of the ADC family and has an extended C-terminus with extra 13 amino acids when compared with the EcoADC sequence,21 [Fig. 1(a)]. However, strictly conserved residues among ADCs include Lys9, His11, Thr16, Tyr22, Gly24, Ser25, Asp29, Asn51, Arg54, Thr57, Tyr58, Gly72, Ala73, Ala74, Asp82, Ile85, and Asn111 (MtbADC numbering) and they all are involved in structural stability and activity. Amongst the aforementioned conserved residues, Lys9, His11, and Tyr58 have been hypothesized to be involved in relaying of the proton extricated from the catalytic Ser25 residue, thereby increasing the nucleophilicity of the latter and priming it for an attack on the carbonyl moiety (part of the Gly24 amide). Once the ester intermediate is formed, Thr57 most possibly acts as a base for removing the Ca proton of the aforementioned serine residue, leading to breakdown of the ester itself. Arg54 helps to stabilize the incoming aspartate residue through an ion-pair. The structure is predominantly a double-w b-barrel consisting of seven b-strands, two a-helices, and two 310 helices [Fig. 2(a)]. The entire b-sheet has very regular and stable conformation. The refined model contains the first 113 amino acid residues of the uncleaved protein. The electron density for the structure is well defined throughout [Fig. 2(b)]. However, residues 114­139 are not observed in electron density maps and are likely to be disordered. The electrostatic surface charge distribution and curvature for MtbADC are depicted in Figure 2(c). The hydrophobic pocket located between the residues of the interior face of the b-sheet and a-helices has potential for binding to steroid and other hydrophobic ligands. EcoADC and the ADC protein of H. pylori (HpyADC) also exist as a tetramer in solution. The packing arrangements in the EcoADC10,22 and HpyADC21 crystal structures use crystallographic symmetry to generate the tetramer, whereas there are two full tetramers packed in the asymmetric unit of MtbADC. À26Ca and 23CaÀ À25Ca disComparison of the 24CaÀ tances of MtbADC with those in other ADC crystal structures [Table II; Fig. 3(a)] clearly establishes the fact that MtbADC in the present crystal structure is the uncleaved precursor p-protein. Superimposition of the Mtb pro-ADC structure with the self-processed, pyruvoyl structure of EcoADC (PDB entry 1AW8) through the ° Dali server24 shows an r.m.s.d. of 1.3 A for 89 Ca atompairs, while with unprocessed EcoADC (PDB entry ° 1PPY) shows an r.m.s.d. of 1.12 A for 111 Ca atom-pairs. Implications of Self-Processing and Catalytic Mechanism MtbADC is expected to follow the same autocatalytic selfprocessing mechanism in vivo as reported for EcoADC.10,22

S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.25,26 Structural evidence for the catalytic mechanism of MtbADC can be well understood from the two crystal structures of HpyADC21: the apo structure of the self-processed enzyme and the structure of the enzyme in complex with the substrate analog isoasparagine. The proposed reaction mechanism of ADC involves Schiff base intermediates. The mechanism includes (1) formation of the enzyme­substrate intermediate via a Schiff base linkage to the pyruvoyl group, (2) the a-carboxylate group is released from the adduct to form the extended enolate; Tyr58 serves as a proton donor to protonate the Ca atom of the extended enolate reaction intermediate, (3) which is reprotonated to form the enzyme-product Schiff base intermediate, and (4) the product b-alanine is finally released by hydrolysis and the pyruvoyl group is regenerated. To appreciate the level of structural differences and conservation, especially among conserved residues, the active site of uncleaved MtbADC was superimposed with that of uncleaved EcoADC [Fig. 3(b)], cleaved EcoADC [Fig. 3(c)], and cleaved HpyADC [Fig. 3(d)]. The two amino acid differences between MtbADC (Val26 and Val47) and EcoADC (Cys26 and Trp47) do not significantly interfere with substrate binding. This is very evident from Figure 3(d), where HpyADC is complexed with a substrate analog, isoasparigine. Similarly, the Val26-Ile26 difference between MtbADC and HpyADC is also insignificant. It is noteworthy that in the vicinity of the substrate, the corresponding residues that are located downstream of the GS cleavage location superimpose better than those located upstream.

vector and extensive restriction enzyme digestions confirmed the authenticity of the product. This result indicates that the panD gene is properly transcribed in M. tuberculosis. Western blot analysis of the whole cell extract of M. tuberculosis was performed using an anti-panD polyclonal antibody (generated in rabbits) to recombinant 6X-His ADC. The sera specifically recognized the $16 kDa protein in the Mtb extract, Figure 1(b). The blot was developed using chemiluminiscent substrate (ECL). The pattern of ADC expression in Mtb was further elucidated using immuno-gold electron microscopy, Figure 1(c). The ADC protein was visualized at the surface as well as within the Tubercle bacilli. An interestingly observed feature was the variation in the number of gold grains in virulent (H37Rv and Erdman) strains in comparison to the attenuated H37Ra strain. The number of gold grains in H37Rv is (40 Æ 2) and in Erdman is (30 Æ 3), whereas in H37Ra it is (8 Æ 3) (data not shown for Erdman and H37Ra). These numbers indicate a relation between the expression of ADC and pathogenicity, which must be further experimentally confirmed. In summary, the immunogold electron microscopic results show that the ADC protein is expressed in Mtb H37Rv, Erdman as well as in H37Ra strains indicating its universal in vivo metabolic role. Potentials for a Drug Target Since pantothenate is synthesized in microorganisms, plants and fungi, but not in animals, the enzymes that are involved in this biosynthetic pathway are potential targets for antibacterial and antifungal agents.28 The unique feature of being absent in the human host, in addition to its significance in the cellular metabolism of Mtb, endows exclusive significance upon pantothenate family members, especially ADC, as important drug and vaccine candidates. This was emphasized in the work of Jacobs and coworkers,29 who constructed a double deletion mutant, the DpanCD mutant, with a view to globally impair the ability of Mtb to synthesize lipids. The mice that were infected with the DpanCD mutant were able to survive for 36 weeks even though they exhibited similar growth rates as compared to M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv. In comparison, the mice that were infected with BCG-Pasteur succumbed within 14 weeks of infection, emphasizing the extent of attenuation of the DpanCD mutant. This work thus emphasizes the importance of the pantothenate metabolism in the pathogenicity of Mtb and may lead towards new therapeutic solutions for this old scourge of humanity. At the heart of the fight against tuberculosis (TB) lies its cell wall, a multilayered structure adorned with a number of lipo-glycans, which protect the bacterium from environmental stresses and antimicrobial defense. The metabolism and biosynthesis of lipids and lipo-glycans have been shown to play a pivotal role in the intracellular survival and persistence of Mtb. Therefore any impediment in this pathway will affect the survival of the bacterium. This ensures that any inhibitor or drug against ADC would be of low potential in toxicity to the

Confirmation of the Expression of the panD Gene in M. tuberculosis In the context of studying the MtbADC protein as a viable drug target, it is essential to determine the level of expression of the ADC protein in Mtb. As gene redundancy and gene decay occur very frequently in pathogenic mycobacterial species,27 we have to discount the possibility of the protein being nonexistent or inactive. The expression of ADC in Mtb was confirmed by cDNA analysis, immunoblotting with the anti-ADC polyclonal antibody using whole cell lysate and immunoelectron microscopy. The total Mtb H37Rv RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers. The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR using panD gene specific primers. The obtained 435 bp product was cloned into the pGEMT-Easy

person treated as the drug target is unique to the bacterium and is not present in mammals. Moreover, the presence of the ADC gene in only one copy in the sequenced Mtb genome further increases the importance of ADC as a suitable drug target.

CONCLUSIONS Approximately 32% of the world human population is infected with Mtb and the percentage is constantly increasing every year. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared TB a global health emergency in 1993, even though anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy had been available since the mid 1950s along with a live attenuated vaccine (BCG) that makes tuberculosis 100% curable. With the wide spread use of chemotherapy against tuberculosis, the disease showed a dramatic decline in incidence in the 1960s­1980s, but resurgence was again observed in the 1990s. This resurgence is attributed to the advent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. More recently, as the BCG has become inefficient due to its inability to protect against adult pulmonary tuberculosis and persistent infection, the major focus of TB research has shifted to developing a potent vaccine. A primary obstacle in designing a vaccine better than BCG has been the inability to identify virulence factors and immunoprotective antigens of Mtb. The completion of the genome sequence of Mtb H37Rv in 1998 has offered a blue print for designing novel vaccine candidates. The central dogma for identification of new anti-TB drugs is that they should be active against both latent or dormant and nondormant bacilli. TB, as a pathogen, has evolved to exploit dormancy or latency to its advantage. Since most of the current drugs target the rapidly growing organism, the current drug regimens in the treatment of this infection tend to be of extraordinary long durations, which lead to tremendous problems like patient noncompliance and development of MDR strains. This is where the uniqueness of targeting ADC as a drug target may be of considerable importance. An inhibitor or drug that is developed against ADC could be used in conjunction with conventional antibiotics. This combined attack can shorten the time frame of the current therapy and help for an effective clearance of the bacterium from the patient. REFERENCES
