There is circumstantial evidence that they stabilize the mucus layer, and may affect the rate of healing of the mucosal epithelium. Results: We have determined the structure of porcine pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide (PSP) to 2.5A resolution. The polypeptide contains two trefoil domains. The domain structure is compact, and is composed of a central short antiparallel [3-sheet with one short helix above and one below it. This is a novel motif. The two domains are related by two-fold symmetry, and each domain contains a cleft. Conclusions. The cleft within each domain could accommodate a polysaccharide chain, and may therefore be responsible for binding mucin glycoproteins. We suggest that PSP may cross-link glycoproteins, explaining its ability to stabilize the mucus layer.

Structure 15 December 1993, 1:253-262 Key words: mucus layer, P-domain, pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide, trefoil family, X-ray structure Introduction Trefoil peptides [1] make up a rapidly growing family found mainly in association with the gastrointestinal tract. Circumstantial evidence has accumulated during the last 3-4 years indicating that trefoil peptides have a stabilizing effect on the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract, and the peptides have thus been suggested to be naturally-occurring healing factors for peptic ulcers [2], inflammatory bowel disease and other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract involving mucosal injury [3-5]. Mammalian trefoil peptides have one or two characteristic domains comprising 38 or 39 amino acid residues, including six cysteine residues which form disulphide bridges in the configuration 1-5, 2-4 and 3-6. This disulphide bonding pattern results in a distinctive three-leaved structure giving the peptide family its name [1].

In contrast to porcine PSP, the human counterpart, hSP, is expressed in the stomach but not in the pancreas [12]. Human spasmolytic polypeptide shows high sequence homology to PSP [12,13] (Fig. 2) especially within the trefoil domain. This domain, also referred to as the P-domain motif [12], is well conserved in other members of the trefoil family: intestinal trefoil factor, ITF, from rat [14] and man [15]; human breast cancer associated pS2 peptide [16-18]; frog skin peptides xP1, xP2 and xP4 [19,20], frog integumentary mucin C.1 [21] and rabbit zonapellucida protein [22]. At least nine different trefoil domains are known in six mammalian peptides (Fig. 2), but so far the threedimensional structure has not been reported for any trefoil peptide. Here we report the X-ray structure of porcine pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide (PSP), a member of the family containing two trefoil domains, and describe the atomic model refined at 2.5 A resolution.

Porcine pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide (PSP) was originally found in a side fraction from the purification of porcine insulin [6]. The amount of PSP in the porcine pancreas is 100mgkg -~ [7]. PSP contains 106 amino acid residues in a single chain and the peptide is heavily cross-linked by seven disulphide bonds (Fig. 1) [1,8,9]. PSP is secreted in large quan tities (50-100 mg1-1) into the pancreatic juice upon stimulation with pancreozymin or secretin [7,10], and it has been found that PSP is resistant to digestion by intraluminal proteases within the gastrointestinal tract [6] explaining how it retains its full range of biological activities following oral administration [ 11].

Results and discussion Structure of the PSP molecule The approximate size of the PSP molecule is 50 x 20 x 20g., giving it a rectangular shape. As expected from the amino acid sequence [8] and disulphide bond assignment [1], PSP is composed of two homologous trefoil domains.

residues 55-59 and a hydrogen bonded turn at residues 100-103. When superimposing the Ccz coordinates of the four trefoil domains, a root mean standard deviation (rmsd) of 1.07· is obtained. However, only residues 5-9, 55-59 and residues 10-51, 59-100 are superimposed due to the extra residue of loop 1 of the amino-terminal domain. This alignment was determined using the LSQ-improved option of the O program [24]. The overall fold of the PSP molecule has approximate two-fold symmetry, as can be clearly seen in Fig. 3. Argl0 forms a hydrogen bond between the two trefoil domains and also appears to be critical for the folding of the carboxy-terminal tail of PSP (see Table 1). The network of hydrogen bonds in which Argl0 participates is illustrated in Fig. 4. Additional hydrogen bonds involved in the folding of the carboxy-terminal tail are listed in Table 1.

ton, then the two trefoil domains are connected by polypeptide chains formed by residues 47-57 and 96-106 (Fig. 1). The Cys643ys104 disulphide bridge closes the molecule as a ring and gives it a very compact shape. It also keeps the interconnecting chains in close contact with the two domains. In the following description of secondary structure, the assignments are based on the algorithms of Kabsch and Sander [23]. Both the interconnecting chains are in an extended conformation with a short 310-helix at

Each domain contains three helices, one on each side of a short antiparallel ~-sheet and one at the tip of loop 1 (note that loops 1, 2 and 3 are defined by the disulphide bridges, see Fig. 2). In the amino-terminal domain, the helices include residues 5-10 (czhelix A), 2 5 0 2 (a-helix B) and 12-16 (310-helix C), and the ~-sheet comprises residues 35-37 and 45-47. In the carboxy-terminal trefoil domain, the helices include residues 55-59 (310-helix A'), 74-81 (a-helix B') and 61~55 (310-helix C'), and the ]3-sheet is composed of residues 84-86 and 94-96 (Fig. 2). Further, there are three hydrogen-bonded turns consisting of residues 21-24, 33-34 and 40-43. The effect of the deletion in the carboxy-terminal domain after residue 58 is the conversion of the A helix from an 0t-helix to A', which is a shorter 310-helix. How ever, the two halves of the polypeptide chain superimpose very well from the positions of the C and C' helix. From Fig. 3b and Fig. 5 it can be seen that the A and B

gen bonds are found in the amino-terminal domain (see Table 1). Asp12 and Lys14 clearly form a complex hydrogen-bonding network in this region. Arg16, which makes hydrogen bonds with Pro44 and Asp37 (Table 1), seems to be very important for the folding of the amino-terminal domain since it is conserved in all known members of the family of trefoil loop proteins and is positioned centrally within the domain. Arg16 is 'stacked' with Phe47 which is also a conserved residue. Other hydrogen bonds within this domain are listed in Table 1 along with those found in the carboxy-terminal domain. Arg81 is close to the molecular surface and hence is only involved in one intramolecular hydrogen bond. The water molecules included are all involved in hydrogen bonds to residues on the surface of the peptide (i.e. no structural waters are seen in the core of the molecule). In each of the two domains, the six cysteine residues are disulphide linked in the configuration 1-5, 2-4 and 3~5, when the cysteines are numbered from the amino terminus. In the present structure, the assignment of the disulphide bonds is 8-35, 19-34, 29-46 in the amino-terminal domain and 58-84, 68-83, 78-95 in the carboxy-terminal domain. The seventh disulphide bond, between Cys6 and Cysl04, confirms the secondary structure previously suggested (Fig. 1). The disulphide bonds in each of the two domains create the three characteristic peptide loops in each domain which give rise to the trefoil nomenclature [1]. The three-dimensional structure reveals that the three loops or 'leaves' are stacked in both domains (see Fig. 5). The secondary structural elements of the trefoil domain are generally short, leading to its very compact form.

helices on each side of the [3-sheet are approximately orthogonal to each other, with the B helix following the direction of the [3-sheet.

dimer are re.lated by a non-crystallographic two-fold axis. This symmetry axis is in the plane orthogonal to the c-axis, in spherical polar angles at ~ = 0.2 °, = 108.5 ° and × = 180,3 °, using the conventions of the X-PLOR program [26]. This contradicts earlier findings by Gorman et aL [27] who found that the noncrystallographic two-fold axis forms an angle of 30 ° or 60 ° with the longest axis, based on investigations of the self-rotation function, The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. There is a long intermolecular hydrogen bond between Asn15 N52 in molecule A and Asn67 O81 in molecule B (3.55·) and one between Asn67 O51 in

molecule A and Asn15 N52 in molecule B (3.18A). The side chains of residues involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonding are shown in Fig. 6. The number of hydrogen bonds (only two bonds) between the two molecules does not seem significant. However, the hydrophobic regions defined by Va162, Ile89 and Va192 of both molecules are in close contact in the dimer, forming a closed hydrophobic core. These residues could be important for dimerization. The positions of these hydrophobic residues are also shown in Fig. 6. The rmsd of alignment of the two molecules in the asTmmetric unit is 0,51 g, for the Ccz atoms. Hence the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical.

Resistance to degradation by proteases PSP has been shown to be highly resistant to the proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin [6]. While trypsin normally cleaves peptides after arginine or lysine residues, chymotrypsin is tess specific, and generally cleaves after hydrophobic residues. Since stability towards proteases appears to be a feature of all the members of the trefoil loop family of peptides, it can be assumed that the stability is related to the overall folding of the molecule. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the molecule is compact due to the short secondary structural elements and the large number of disulphide bridges. The Cys642ys104 disulphide bridge in particular, ensures that the molecule does not have easily accessible terminal ends. This combination of structural features probably accounts for the pronounced resistance towards proteases.

Inspection of the main chain B-factor plot (Fig. 7) reveals that the most flexible region of the PSP molecule occurs around residues 99-102, and Vail01 seems to be an obvious site for hydrolysis by chymotrypsin. However, because the carboxy-terminal end is kept close to the two domains, this part of the PSP molecule cannot fit into the binding pockets of the proteases.
Possible interactions of trefoil peptides with mucins Peptides and proteins containing trefoil domains have been isolated or cloned from a series of different organs and tissues from different species. In mammals, they appear to function mainly by association with the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract. In man, three trefoil peptides are known at present: hSP, ITF and pS2 (as described in the Introduction). Under normal physiological conditions, all three peptides are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract - - hSP and pS2 in the epithelial mucosal layer of the stomach [12,18], and ITF in the epithelial mucosal layer of the small intestine and

colon [15].
It is tempting to speculate that trefoil peptides may act to stabilize the mucus gel layer since they are coexpressed with mucin-type glycoproteins [28] in the human gastrointestinal tract. Such a stabilizing effect could be mediated by formation of complexes between the highly glycosylated mucin glycoproteins and trefoil peptides.

Two different representations of the trefoil domain are shown in Fig. 8. They reveal a cleft in each domain between loops 2 and 3. The width of this cleft, as judged by the distance between Cas of Trp45 and Pro22, is 10.12A in molecule A and 9.10~ in molecule B. This cleft is significantly narrower in the carboxy-terminal domain, where it is found to be 0nly 8.41 ~ in molecule A and 8.25A in molecule B. This means that the two grooves are not identical in size, but they are primarily built of the same residues. Further, the observed differences can be related to packing effects or to a different number of water molecules bound in the two grooves. The differences in cleft size observed in the four trefoil loop domains found in this crystal structure

258

indicate that the volume is flexible, and can adapt to a specific substrate. Fig. 8 also shows that all the conserved residues (see Fig. 2) are either placed around this groove, or form the core of the domain (Arg16, Val40, Va143 and Phe47). It is tempting to propose a role for this groove that is related to the function of the molecule. The groove is primarily formed from peptide backbone atoms. The only side chains pointing into the groove are the conserved residues I1e24, Phe36, Pro44 and Trp45. In contrast, all of the non-conserved residues in this region of the molecule point away from the groove. As judged from a preliminary docking experiment, both clefts are deep enough to accommodate an oligosaccharide, or part of a longer polysaccharide chain. Pro44 and Trp45 could interact with the hydrophobic part of the carbohydrates and the potential also exists for hydrogen-bond formation to the hydroxyl groups in the cleft. A function of the trefoil domains could be to act as 'cross-linkers' of the polysaccharide chains of the mucin glycoproteins, and in this way increase the viscosity of the mucus layer. This proposed function of course requires at least two trefoil domains in a cross-linking unit. If PSP does dimerize in vivo, this would lead to four potential bonding sites (see Fig. 6) all oriented in different directions. We are currently investigating the validity of this cross-linking hypothesis by crystal soaking experiments using a number of different substrates.

contains two trefoil domains, shows that the molecule is compact, due to extensive cross-linking, and has short secondary structural elements that are not sufficiently flexible to be accessible to protease active sites. This may explain the observed resistance of trefoil peptides to proteases, w h i c h is important for their survival in the gastric tract. The trefoil fold is a n e w motif, distinct from the folds found in all o t h e r k n o w n protein structures, for example the 'kringle' domain of blood coagulation factors and the epidermal g r o w t h factor domain. The conserved residues Argl6 and Phe47 appear particularly important for the folding of the domain, stacking t o g e t h e r to form the c e n t r e of the hydrophobic core. The majority of the conserved residues contribute to a cleft, 8 - 1 0 A wide, found in each of the trefoil domains. Preliminary docking e x p e r i m e n t s s h o w that the cleft could a c c o m m o d a t e part of an oligosaccharide chain, for example the carbohydrate attached to a m u c i n glycoprotein. If this is the case, since PSP contains two such clefts, it may cross-link mucins, helping t h e m to form a protective gel over the mucosal epithelium. Three trefoil peptides are k n o w n in man, w h i c h are specifically expressed either in the stomach (hSP and ITF) or in the small intestine and colon (pS2). hSP is the h u m a n c o u n t e r p a r t of PSP, and, like PSP, has two trefoil domains. ITF and pS2, however, have only one trefoil domain; it seems plausible that t h e y bind to mucins, but less likely that they cross-link t h e m unless t h e y dimerize in vivo. The m e c h a n i s m of action of the single-domain trefoil peptides may therefore be distinct from that of the two-domain trefoil peptides.

Biological implications
Trefoil peptides are believed to contribute to the healing of peptic ulcers and o t h e r mucosal injuries by stabilizing the m u c u s layer of the intestinal tract. The m e c h a n i s m of this stabilization is unknown. The X-ray structure of porcine pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide (PSP), w h i c h

Purification, crystallization and data collection
Preliminary structure analysis by X-ray [27,29] as well as by NMR [25] techniques has previously been carried out on PSP. In the present study, PSP was purified [6] and crystallized [29] as previously described. Pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide crystallizes in space group I212121. The crystal contains two molecules per asymmetric unit (referred to as molecule A and molecule B below) and 62 % water. M1 experimental data were collected (using monochromatic synchrotron radiation) at the EMBL outstation at DESY, Hamburg. The Hendrix Lenffer imaging plate scanner, constructed at EMBL Hamburg, was used as a detector. The native data were collected in two batches: (1) low order data ( > 8A resolution), 23 frames at a crystal-to-plate distance of 400 mm with 4 ° oscilla tions and (2) higher order data, 46 frames at a distance 230 m m with 2 ° oscillations. Only one crystal was used. Wavelength of synchrotron radiation was 1.009&. All data were procesed with the DENZO program (An oscillation data processing program for macromolecular crystallography, Yale University, CT, USA, 1986). Further data processing was performed with the CCP4 [SERC (UK), Collaborative Computer Project No.4, Daresbury Laboratory, UK, 1979] and PHASES [W Furey (1991). A program package for phasing in macromolecular crystallography, University of Pittsburg, PA, USA] program packages. The program AGROVATA (from the CCP4 package) was used to analyze the data and to perform the averaging of equivalent measurements. In the averaging, individual reflections with a deviation of more than 3 standard deviations from the mean were rejected until at least 3 measurements remained. The unit cell parameters, determined from the data processing, were a = 54.7~, b = 72.6A and c = 181.5A. The standard deviations derived from counting statistics were modified according to the following scheme:

Resolution is determined as the highest order shell where the internal R-factor, Ri = ~ hkl Zi Ili(hkl) -- < I(hkl) > ]/£hkl £i li(hkl) is < 0.20. Number of reflections is the total number of reflections within the resolution limit and with a partiality above 0.5. Number rejected is the number of reflections rejected in the averaging procedure. Number of unique reflections

is the number of unique reflections after averaging. Overall completeness is the percentage of theoretically obtainable data measured. Outermost shell is the highest order data referred to below. I/c7(I) > 2 is the number of reflections with intensity greater than 2 standard deviations. These data were used in subsequent refinements.

complished with the program CMBISO and the derived difference Patterson maps were analyzed with the program MAPVIEW (both from the phasing package by W Furey). The Ag + derivative showed peaks in the Harker sections corresponding to two heavy atom sites. These peaks could not be seen in the anomalous Patterson map probably due to the low f"at the applied wavelength. The two sites were related to a common origin by standard difference Fourier techniques. Phase in formation to 3.0A resolution was extracted from this derivative. For the Pt 2 + derivative a difference Patterson map was calculated to 3.0A resolution. This map showed only one site. A cross difference Fourier, using the phases determined from the Ag + derivative, using data up to 4g. resolution, verified the site. Subsequent processing was done with programs from the CCP4 suite. The positions of the heavy atoms were refined with the program HEAVY. Further phase refinement and phase calculation was done with the program MLPHARE. Table 3 lists the heavy atom positions determined. In fact, only one binding site was found for both derivatives. However, the site was occupied by Ag + in both molecules comprising the asymmetric unit, but Pt 2+ only complexed with molecule A. Both metal ions form a complex with the Met60 and Met99 side chains which are in close proximity, and located on the surface of the peptide.

where k = 1.7 and p = 0.0 since the standard deviations found from counting statistics were generally found to be too low compared with the statistical standard deviations. The crystals for a Pt 2 + derivative were obtained by adding i mM K2PtCI4 to the mother liquor and soaking the crystals for 1 week. A wavelength of 0.9901& was used for collecting data on heavy-atom derivatives. The diffraction data were collected in 46 frames, with oscillations of 2 ° and a crystal-to-film distance of 230 mm. The cell dimensions of the derivatized crystals were altered to a = 5 3 . 5 g , b = 7 2 . 9 A and c = 181.7A, indicating non isomorphism with the native crystal. In addition, the crystals showed a rapid decay in the beam; the scale factor of the last frame was determined as 0.55 with a relative B-factor of - 1 . 7 7 A 2. A scaled < F p H > / < F p > plot against resolution indicated that the Pt 2 + derivative was only isomorphous to 4 since the slope became significantly different from zero at this resolution. An Ag + derivative was made by soaking crystals for 2 days in the mother liquor, made 5 mM with respect to AgNO 3, The same data collection parameters were used as for the Pt 2 + derivative. These crystals showed no signs of non isomorphism. Table 2 contains a summary of the data collection statistics. Only isomoIDhous contributions were used from both derivatives. The resolution cutoff criterion for all three data sets was that the internal R-factor should not exceed 0.20 in the outermost resolution shell.

The electron density map produced from the MIR data showed well defined large solvent channels in the structure, but it was not possible to trace the polypeptide chain. This is probably related to the low phasing power of the Pt 2+ derivative. The program SQUASH [30] was used for solvent flattening and phase extension from 4 to 3g.. Histogram matching, automatic Wang solvent mask generation and Sayre equation techniques were employed. This improved the overall figure of merit to 0.75. The resulting map was of high quality with clear continuity in the electron density (see Fig. 9). The remarkable success of the procedure is probably related to the large and well defined solvent content of the crystals. The initial model was built with the program O [24]. Both molecules in the asymmetric unit could be traced and no averaging procedures were used.

Refinement of the structure

261

The initial model was refined by simulated annealing using the program X-PLOR [26]. Data in the range 8-2.5& were used in the refinement, only including reflections for which I>2cy(I). This excluded 1449 out of a total of 12 348 reflections. The standard slow cool protocol was used in the refinement, starting initially at 3000 K and performing 50 steps of molecular dynamics (time step 0.5 fs) then reducing the temperature by 25 K and repeating until the temperature reached 300 K. In later refinement calculations, the initial temperature was set at 800 K. A total of 23 refinement cycles were conducted with altemating X-PLOR calculations and manual density fitting. The final restricted R-value is 0.20 with inclusion of 88 water molecules, -,all with B-factors below 60 ~2, returning 2Fo-F c density and in proximity of the protein molecules. The corresponding free R-value is 0.30 [26] using 10 % of the data as a test set. xX,2aen all measured reflections are included in the calculation of the restricted R-value, a value of 0.22 is obtained. Table 5 shows a breakdown of R-values on resolution. The average deviation from ideality in bond lengths is 0.023 g. and in bond angles is 2.3 °.

NREF free is the number of reflections included in the calculation of R-free. R = ]~hkl [Fo--Fc[/EFo. R-value free cum. is the cumulative Rfree. NREFrest. is the number of reflections included in the calculation of the restricted R-value.

The Ramachandran plot (Fig. 10) shows no residues, other than glycines or prolines, outside favoured or allowed regions. The plot includes both molecules in the asymmetric unit. 82 % of the residues are in the most favoured regions, the rest are in favoured regions. The real space correlation coefficients were examined as a function of residue number, as implemented in program O [31]. A plot of these correlation coefficients is shown in Fig. 11. The function is computed by calculating grid sums in a series of density maps calculated from the model coordinates of a se lected group of atoms from each residue. This function can reveal problem areas in a structure. The plot shows no signs of errors in the model and values are as expected for a structure at this resolution. However, it does reveal that the density around residues 9%105 is not as well defined as the rest of the density in either of the molecules. As can be seen from Fig. 1, this part of the molecule is not part of the domain structure and is probably quite flexible. The average B-value, including both molecules in the asymmetric unit, was 20.3 A2 after the final cycle of refinement. A plot of the average B-values of the main-chain atoms for all residues is shown in Fig. 7. This plot also reveals that the region around 99-105 is probably disordered, and indicates some disorder around the carboxy-terminal end and around Glu54 which is in
