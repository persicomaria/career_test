ABSTRACT Recent crystallographic studies have revealed the structures of some invertebrate extracellular giant hemoglobins of 3,600 kDa or 400 kDa and their common quaternary structure of dodecameric subassembly composed of four kinds of globin subunits (A1, A2, B1, and B2). These results have provided insight into the mechanisms of their unique functional properties of oxygen binding and sulfide binding. All of these structures were solved with oxygenated or COliganded forms at low or moderate resolutions. We have determined the crystal structure of 400 kDa Hb from a poly° chaete Oligobrachia mashikoi at 1.95 A resolution. The electron densities at higher resolution confirm the existence of an isoform of the B1 subunit because of the inconsistency with the model that was built from the formerly known amino acid sequence. The brownish color of the crystals used in this study and the absorption spectrum from the dissolved crystals strongly indicated that the obtained structure was a ferric met state, whereas completele absence of electron density around the distal heme pockets were observed at the A2, B1, and B2 subunits. We concluded that the obtained structure was in unliganded met forms at three of four globin subunits in the 24mer assembly and in oxygenated forms at the remaining A1 subunits. The partially unli-

ganded structure showed remarkable structural changes at the AB loop regions causing quaternary rearrangements of the EF-dimer structure. In contrast, few changes occurred at the interface regions composed of the E and F helices. These results suggest that the ligand-induced structural changes of Oligobrachia Hb are quite different from those of the wellstudied mollusk Hb having the same EF-dimer structure. The structural rearrangements make the dodecameric subassembliy form a tighter conformation than those of fully oxygenated or CO-liganded dodecamer structure.

different variations in their quaternary structures.1­4 Some of the annelids have extracellular giant Hbs of 3600 kDa or 400 kDa. Earthworm Lumbricus terrestris has a hexagonal bilayer (HBL) Hb of 3600 kDa. Tube worms and beard worms (siboglinid polychaetes), which primarily inhabit sulfide-rich areas of the seabed such as hydrothermal vents, also have extracellular giant Hbs. A vestimentiferan tube worm, Riftia pachyptila, has 3600 kDa Hb and 400 kDa Hb in its blood, and has another 400 kDa Hb in its coelomic fluid.5 A frenulate beard worm, Oligobrachia mashikoi, has only 400 kDa Hb in its blood.6,7 There has been no report of the existence of coelomic Hb in their fluid. The giant Hbs of these siboglinid polychaetes show high oxygen affinity and moderate cooperativity, indicating that they adapt to the hypoxic environment of their habitat.8 Moreover, it has also been reported that these Hbs can simultaneously transport both sulfide and oxygen.9­12 Several crystallographic studies of giant Hbs have been performed. In HBL Hbs, the whole structure of Lumbri° cus HBL Hb (Type I) at 3.5 A resolution,13 a reconstructed subassembly of its Hb dodecameric structure at ° ° 2.6 A resolution,14 and a 6.2 A resolution whole structure of HBL Hb (Type II) of Arenicola marina15 are available. In siboglinid polychaetes, a 400 kDa whole ° structure of Oligobrachia vascular Hb at 2.85 A resolu10 and a structure of Riftia coelomic Hb (C1) at 3.15 tion ° A resolution11 have been reported. HBL Hbs are composed of 144 globin subunits and 36 non-globin linker chains, whereas 400 kDa Hbs consist of 24 globin subunits. These structures have shown that giant Hbs are constructed highly hierarchically, and that both the HBL Hbs and the 400 kDa Hbs have a common fundamental unit of a Hb dodecamer structure, which is a domeshaped threefold trimer-of-tetramers containing many disulfide bonds. The 400 kDa Hbs have a spherical structure with a large cavity composed of two dodecamers. HBL Hbs are more complicated. An Hb dodecamer in complex with a linker heterotrimer forms a 1/12 unit, and six copies of this unit assemble into a hexagonal ring with a sixfold symmetry. The whole molecule is constructed by two hexagonal rings. In addition, though all the tetrameric structures in the common dodecamer unit of these giant Hbs are composed of four different globin subunits (termed A1, A2, B1, and B2), they take a pseudo dimer-of-dimer structure and this dimer structure is basically the same as the ``EF-dimer'' structure of echinoderm (Caudina arenicola) Hb16 and clam (Scapharca inaequivalvis) HbI17,18 of which the mechanism of cooperativity has been discussed in detail.17,19­23 At present, all the crystal structures of giant Hbs have been solved as liganded forms with oxygen (Oligobrachia Hb and Riftia Hb) and carbon monoxide (Lumbricus Hb and Arenicola Hb), and their resolutions are insufficient to discuss the functions in detail. The unliganded form of these giant Hbs is indispensable to elucidation of the

cooperative mechanisms, which remains unknown. We report herein the crystal structure of the met state Hb ° from O. mashikoi at a high resolution of 1.95 A. The higher-resolution model confirms the existence of an isoform of the B1 subunit. In addition, this structure was found in unliganded forms in the three of the four globin subunits, and some conformational changes were observed from that of the oxygenated form. METHODS
Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Siboglinid polychaete, O. mashikoi was collected as described.24 Fresh specimens of O. mashikoi after collection were immediately washed and pushed out from their tubes by a syringe. The bodies were cut in three parts: fore-parts (F), middle-parts (M), and rear-parts (R). These three parts were steeped in ISOGEN reagent (NIPPON GENE, Japan) on ice for 4 h and closely homogenized. Each total RNA was extracted using the method described in the attached instructions. The 18S rRNA bands in each total RNA (0.5 lg) were discriminated by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Each total RNA of 0.5 lg was reversetranscribed in a 20 lL volume with an oligo-dT25 primer using a reverse transcriptase, ReverTra Ace (TOYOBO, Japan), for the first-strand cDNA synthesis.
cDNA cloning and sequencing of the B1b subunit

Common 50 - and 30 -oligonucleotide primers of the B1a and B1b subunits (adding restriction sites) were designed based on the N-terminal and C-terminal nucleotide sequences of the B1a subunit registered in DNA Data Bank of Japan under the accession number of AB185394, as follows: 50 -NdeI-B1 primer: 50 -GGTTA AGCATATGGAATGCTGCAGTAGAGG-30 , and 30 -XhoIB1 primer: 50 -GCCGCTCGAGTTACAAGCCTGCACCAATAC-30 . The PCR reaction was carried out in a 20 lL volume with the primers using a DNA polymerase, KOD -plus- (TOYOBO, Japan) by a Applied Biosystems 2720 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR condition was as follows: one cycle of denaturation at 958C for 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 958C for 20 s, annealing at 608C for 30 s, and extension at 688C for 1.5 min, one cycle of the extension at 688C for 10 min, and one cycle of the end at 48C. The PCR products of the 460 bp fragment of the B1a and B1b subunits were phosphorilated and inserted into a pUC119 vector digested with SmaI using a T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (TOYOBO, Japan) and Ligation-Convenience Kit (NIPPON GENE, Japan). The vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli, XL1 blue MRF0 strain (STRATAGENE). The subcloned cDNAs from recombinant colonies were amplified with M13F and M13R primers using TAKARA Taq DNA poly-

merase (TAKARA, Japan) by the thermal cycler. The sequencing reaction with each M13 primer was performed with a Big Dye Terminator V3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) using the thermal cycler. The sequences of the cDNAs of B1a and B1b subunits were determined using an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) for sequencing analysis. The cDNAs of the B1b subunit was similarly obtained and determined with that of the B1a subunit. The accession number of the B1b subunit was registered as AB360377 in DNA Data Bank of Japan.
RT-PCR analysis

Data collection and model refinement

The 50 - and 30 -detection primers of the B1a and B1b subunits for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were designed as follows: 50 -B1-Nterminal primer: 50 -GAATGC TGCAGTAGAGGTGATGCCGAGG-30 , 30 -B1a-detction primer: 50 -GGTCACACCAGAGATTGCCC-30 , and 30 -B1bdetction primer: 50 -GGTCACACCAGAGATTGCTT-30 . The 50 - and 30 -actin primers obtained from the cDNA library of O. mashikoi (data not shown) were designed as follows: 50 -actin primer: 50 -GCCCCAGAGGAGCACCCAGT-30 , 30 actin primer: 50 -CATCTCCTGCTCGAAGTCGAG-30 . The RT-PCR reactions in a 20 lL volume were carried out by KOD -plus- DNA polymerase with the primers and 1 lL of the template from 20 lL of the first-strand cDNA solution of each three parts. The actin gene of O. mashikoi was adopted as an internal control amplified 393 bp fragment. The RTPCR condition was as follows: 1 cycle of denaturation at 958C for 2 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 958C for 20 s, annealing at 608C for 30 s, and extension at 688C for 1 min, and 1 cycle of the end at 48C. The RT-PCR products of the 308 bp fragment of the B1a and B1b subunits were directly confirmed using sequencing analysis as described earlier.
Protein preparation and crystallization

The 400 kDa Hb was purified basically as reported,6 followed by an additional column chromatography step. The fractions containing Hb were adjusted to a protein concentration of below 1 mg/mL with a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and ammonium sulfate solution was added to a final concentration of 0.8M. The solution was loaded onto a Resource 15 PHE column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.8M ammonium sulfate and eluted with a ammonium sulfate linear gradient from 0.8 to 0M in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The protein was desalted and concentrated to 30 mg/mL by ultrafiltration in a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 208C using equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution containing 7% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 10,000 and 0.2M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Crystals grew within 1­2 weeks, with typical dimensions of 0.2 mm 3 0.2 mm 3 0.5 mm.

Before data collection, crystals were soaked for 24 h in a solution of 0.2M MES, 24% (v/v) PEG 10,000, and 20% (v/v) glycerol adjusted to pH 6.0 with NaOH which provided maximum resolution of crystals between pH ranges of 4.0­7.0, and flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 21838C. X-ray diffraction experiments were performed at the NW12A beamline at PF-AR, KEK and the beamlines BL26B1, BL38B1, BL41XU, BL44XU, and BL45XU at SPring-8. The data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 package25 and truncated by the CCP4 program suite.26 For further refinement, 5% of the reflections were set apart as a random test set to calculate the Rfree values. The structure of Oligobrachia oxyHb (PDB ID 2D2M) was used as a search model for the molecular replacement method by the program MOLREP.27 In the early stages, the model rebuilding and refinement were carried out by using the program LAFIRE,28 following several cycles of manual model rebuilding and refinement performed by using the programs O29 and CNS,30 respectively. After each cycle, 2Fo 2 Fc and Fo 2 Fc electron density maps were calculated to check the fit of the model to the maps. In the final stages, the model was validated and rebuilt by the program COOT.31 Conjugate gradient minimization and restrained individual Bfactor refinements were performed by the program CNS.30 Solvent molecules were placed by identification of peaks grater than 3 r in the Fo 2 Fc map with geometry suitable for hydrogen bonding. Alternate conformations were included in the model at some residues. Contributions of the residues of the B1b subunit were also taken into account (see Results). To avoid undesired increases in the parameters, the 10 substituted residues of the B1b subunit were added to the model as pseudo double conformations. A total of 4446 protein atoms (574 residues of the four subunits, 14 residues of the alternate conformations, and 10 residues of the B1b subunit), four hemes, an oxygen molecule, two glycerols, and 524 water molecules were included in the final model. The final model quality was assessed by the program PROCHECK.32 Figures were prepared by using the program PYMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge.net/).

ity using the samples prepared by the modified purification step and slightly changed crystallization conditions, as reported previously,33 where the reproducibility of the crystallization was poor and several months were needed to get the crystals for the sufficient diffraction data. The crystals were bright red when they first appeared, indicating oxygenated Hb (oxyHb), then changing to the characteristic brown of ferric met Hb (metHb) after further incubation for several days or weeks. The cell constants of the brownish crystals differed significantly from those ° of oxyHb, where the c axis was reduced from $276 A to ° . The high R value of 0.49 just after molecular $271 A replacement using oxyHb as a search model implied some structural changes between the oxygenated form and that of the brownish crystal. The quality of the electron density maps greatly improved from that of the previous map,10 and many peaks for solvent molecules were clearly observed. The overall structure of Oligobrachia Hb and its subunit composition are shown in Figure S1 and the statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in Table I. The Ramachandran plot shows 94.6% of the residues in the most favored regions and the remainder in additionally and generously allowed regions, indicating that the model geometry also improved to the ° appropriate quality at a resolution of 1.95 A.

Apart from rotamer changes or double-conformations, the electron density maps obviously show inconsistency with the model at certain amino acid residues in the B1 subunit. For example, clear electron density in the Fo 2 Fc map and the unnaturaliy large density in the 2Fo 2 Fc map around the Ala38 Cb atom indicate that this position is partially occupied by a valine. At Ala41, a weaker peak and a stronger peak of Fo 2 Fc density near the Cb atom implies some contribution from a threonine [Fig. 1(A)]. A large negative peak in the Fo 2 Fc density and an absence of the 2Fo 2 Fc density around the Cg atom of Pro59 indicates that some smaller residue must be assigned [Fig. 1(B)]. Such inconsistent electron densities were found at several residues only in the B1 subunit, and these facts strongly suggest that there is an isoform of the B1 subunit. Indeed, another cDNA similar to that of the B1 subunit has recently been cloned (DNA Data Bank of Japan accession No. AB360377). The novel B1 amino acid sequence (B1b) shows a total of 10 substitutions (see Fig. 2) compared with the original amino acid sequence (B1a). At nine positions of the substitutions between two B1 isoforms, slight or markedly incompatible electron densities with a model that was built by the B1a amino acid sequence were observed. Only at Gln/ Glu112 was there no unusual density because the resolution was insufficient to discriminate between the amino group and hydroxyl group. The electron density maps calculated by the model using the B1b amino acid sequence also show incompatibility. These results can be explained by the mixture of the B1a and B1b subunits in the molecule. The electron densities indicate a $50% contribution from each B1a or B1b subunit, and refinements with 0.5/0.5 occupancies of the B1a and B1b subunits showed the lowest R and Rfree values. These results are supported by the fact that the RT-PCR products of both B1a and B1b subunits were actually obtained from one specimen of O. mashikoi, and that expression levels and patterns of the mRNAs of both the subunits were nearly identical in all the parts of the body (see Fig. 3). These RT-PCR results do not contradict the idea that the existence ratio of the B1a to B1b subunits was $50/ 50, which we estimated from the electron densities and crystallographic R value analyses, by considering that each mRNAs were translated to almost the same amount of proteins. Similar isoforms of the B1 subunit were identified in the structure of coelomic Hb (C1) of R. pachyptila. Amino acid sequence alignments and the phylogenic tree of other extracellular giant Hbs reveal the possible existence of isoforms of globin subunits in some species.34 Moreover, it has been reported that two of three linker subunits of Lumbricus HBL Hb in each 1/12 protomer are able to be assigned as the L1 and L2 subunits; yet, the electron density of the last one sug-

gests that it mainly arises from the L3 subunit and that there is only a small amount of contribution of the L4 subunit.13
Partially unliganded met form

Many crystal structures of Hbs and Mbs have shown that a water molecule is bound to the iron (III) atom of the heme in the met form. Nevertheless, the electron density maps around the distal heme pockets of Oligobrachia Hb in this study indicated the presence of no ligand except the A1 subunit, where a clear peak for the ligand was observed [Fig. 4(A)]. For the reasons below, the ligand molecule at the A1 heme is assigned as an oxygen molecule. Omit maps calculated after omitting the ligand molecule at the A1 subunit showed an electron density peak consistent with that of a diatomic ligand.

Modeling and refinement as a water molecule at A1 heme pocket led to the appearance of positive peaks in the Fo 2 Fc map at the position corresponding to the second oxygen atom of a dioxygen molecule. The B-factor of the second oxygen atom is almost equivalent to that of another oxygen atom. At the distal sites of the A2, B1, and B2 subunits, electron density maps show no ligands. The environments around the distal sites significantly differ from those of the oxygenated form. The residue at the E11 position is Val in all four subunits of Oligobrachia Hb (see Fig. 2), thus identical to human HbA. In the A2, B1, and B2 subunits of this study, Val E11 moves relative to the heme to tighten space for the ligand (Table II) and prohibits binding of the ligand molecule because of steric hindrance. The same phenomenon was observed in the deoxygenated b subunit of the human HbA.35 The

brownish color of the crystals that were used for data collection apparently represented a met state. In fact, absorption spectra taken from the solution in which the brownish crystals were dissolved show a similar pattern to that of typical metHb [Fig. 4(B)]. Broad and unclear peaks around 500 and 630 nm could be attributed to contamination of the oxygenated state. Based on the above, the obtained structure appeared to be a partially met form in which only the A1 subunits were oxygenated (met(A1-oxy)Hb), and the hemes of other subunits were in a ferric state, despite the sixth coordination sites not being occupied. The average B-factor of the heme in the B2 subunit is ° significantly high, 42.6 A,2 as compared with those of the ° ° ° A1, A2, and B1 subunits (28.8 A,2 26.5 A,2 and 28.9 A,2 respectively). These findings suggest that the heme in the B2 subunit is slightly dissociating from the globin mole-

cule. This is confirmed by the fact that average B-factors of the main-chain atoms of the F helix of the B2 subunit remarkably increase continuously from the beginning to the end of the F helix and FG loop (Fig. S2), including the proximal His98 (F8). Indeed, the electron density of the heme, the latter part of the F helix, and the FG loop tend to be partially or completely disordered at the B2 subunit and sometimes at the A2 and B1 subunits, especially in the case of crystals being left for more than 1 month after crystallization (data not shown). The F helix and the FG loop partially disordered could not hold the heme stably.

The 0.5 lg of each total RNA for the templates of cDNA synthesis showed the same amount of 18S rRNA bands. The actin gene of O. mashikoi was utilized as an internal control. Little mRNA of the B1a and B1b subunits was expressed in the fore-part of the body. The related expression level and pattern of the mRNA of B1a subunit had few differences from that of the B1b subunit.

four subunits in the electron density maps obtained immediately after the molecular replacement using Oligobrachia oxyHb. The root mean square (r.m.s.) difference of atomic positions by superposition of the oxyHb and the refined met(A1-oxy)Hb of each subunit are plotted by residue in Figure S3. The most remarkable structural changes were observed at the AB loop of the A1 and B1 ° subunits. In the A1 subunit, Glu20 moves 5.4 A (between Ca atoms) toward the B1 subunit and interacts with B1 Ser13 by a hydrogen bond network with solvent water ° molecules. The movement of B1 Ala21 is also 7.7 A toward the A1 subunit, thus forming a hydrogen bond network with a solvent and A1 Asn71 [Fig. 5(A)]. There were few structural changes at the AB loop of the A2 subunit, although a great improvement in the electron density of this region was observed. In the oxyHb, the electron density at that region was weak and poorly defined. In contrast, in the met(A1-oxy)Hb of this study, the electron density of this region was obviously high and well-defined so that the model was readily constructed. The movement of B2 His14 permits the formation of a hydrogen bond network to A2 Glu20 at both the main chain and side chain of B2 His14 [Fig. 5(B)]. Tight interactions between B2 Asp17 and B2 Asn79 cause a rearrangement of the A helix of the B2 subunit relative to the A2 subunit, and this movement enables B2 His14 to form a hydrogen bond network stabilizing A2 Glu20

and this loop region. These interactions stabilize each AB loop region, as confirmed by the average B-factor analysis of each subunit, which reveals that the average B-factors of the AB loop regions of all subunits are largely decreased from those of the oxyHb (Fig. S2). The new interactions between each AB loop region and its neighboring subunit cause rearrangements of the quaternary structure of Oligobrachia Hb. The A1B1 dimer structure of Oligobrachia met(A1-oxy)Hb, which is homologous to the EF-dimer structure of Scaharca HbI, results in a tighter conformation than that of the oxyHb. A superposition of the A1B1 dimers of the met(A1oxy)Hb and oxyHb that is performed by the fitting of each A1 subunit reveals that the AB loop of the B1 subunit is drawn to the A1 subunit, and this movement is followed by rearrangements of the A, B, G, and H helices. Similar rearrangements occur in the A2B2 dimer, which is also homologous to the EF-dimer structure (Fig. 6, lower panels). On the other hand, the movements of the E and F helices that form interfaces of the dimer structures are relatively small (Fig. 6, upper panels and Fig. S4), and few tertiary changes of the residues of these helices are observed. The relative positions of two hemes in the dimer structure are almost fixed; the differences in ° the distance between the Fe atom positions are 0.32 A ° in the A1B1 A2B2 dimers, respectively. These and 0.47 A findings indicate that remarkable quaternary structural rearrangements have occurred in the EF-dimer structures of met(A1-oxy)Hb, whereas large tertiary or quaternary structural changes of E and F helices are not observed and the environments of the interfaces of the A1B1 and A2B2 dimers are scarcely modified. These observations are quite different from the case of Scapharca HbI, in which the structural basis of liganded and unliganded forms has been studied in detail. A comparison between the liganded and unliganded structures of Scapharca HbI shows only a slight quaternary structural change but a large tertiary structural rearrangement.17 This tertiary structural rearrangement includes the movements of the Phe in the F helix (F4),19,22 a large displacement of the relative posi° tions of the hemes17,21 (1.8 A with the Fe atom distance), and rearrangements of the hydrogen bond networks in the dimer interface.23 Such structural changes are not observed in the dimer structures of Oligobrachia Hb. These findings suggest that the structural movements caused by ligand binding in Oligobrachia Hb and its homologous giant Hbs have considerably different properties. The quaternary rearrangements of the dimer structures directly affect the disulfide bonded dodecameric structure of giant Hbs. Comparisons of the dodecamer of Oligobrachia met(A1-oxy)Hb with that of oxyHb together with the dodecamers of Riftia C1 and Lumbricus HBL Hb reveal that only Oligobrachia met(A1-oxy)Hb shows a relatively tight conformation (see Fig. 7). These changes cause a reduction in the cell constants of the crystals of the met(A1-oxy)Hb.

A: Electron density maps around the heme of each subunit. The 2Fo 2 Fc and the Fo 2 Fc maps contoured at 1.2 r and 3.5 r are shown as cyan and magenta, respectively. All maps were calculated with a ligand-omitting model. A clear peak indicating the binding of a ligand molecule at the heme pocket was observed only at the A1 subunit. No restraints were employed for the bonds between the Fe and Ne atoms of the heme and proximal His, respectively, whereas a moderate restraint was set to the bonds between the Fe and the ligand. B: Absorption spectrum of dissolved crystals (solid line) and solution before crystallization (dotted line). The brownish crystals were dissolved in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. C: Space-filling and stick representation around the ligand site of the A1 subunit. The heme group and the oxygen molecule together with the proximal (F8) and distal (E7) histidines, residues in the B10, CD1, and E11 are displayed.

DISCUSSION The crystals of the met(A1-oxy) state of Oligobrachia Hb were obtained under the crystallization condition of polyethylene glycol (PEG). In human HbA or Mb, it is well-known that the oxygenated state can be converted to the deoxygenated state in the presence of high concentrations of PEG.36 Oligobrachia Hb has a very high affinity to oxygen6 so that, with ordinarily handling, the oxygenated state would remain through the purification and concentration steps before crystallization, and autoxidation can hardly detected in its spectrum. It may be thought that PEG gradually oxidizes Oligobrachia Hb in the crystallization solution because PEG has some oxidizing activity due to the presence of peroxide impurities and secondary products formed by autoxidation, and the crystals (or the Hb solution before crystal growth) are

not turned to the deoxygenated form but to the partially oxidized met(A1-oxy) form. This result is confirmed by the fact that the addition of reducing agents such as ascorbic acid to the crystallization drops immediately changes the color of crystals from brown to bright red, indicating that the met state is reduced and turns to the oxygenated state. The major change in the experimental conditions from the oxyHb in the previous study10 to the met(A1-oxy)Hb in the present study is a buffer in

the cryoprotectant solution. In the present study, the buffer was MES and the final pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0 with NaOH. In contrast, in the previous study, the buffer was Tris-HCl, which was the same as that used in the crystallization conditions. These solutions were prepared by using a stock solution of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the final pH was not adjusted. The actual pH value of this Tris-based cryoprotectant solution was $4.5 (depending on the concentration of PEG). The reduced cell constants and the crystal structures roughly refined from brownish crystals using the cryoprotectant solution final pH values of 4.0, 5.0, and 7.0 indicated that these structures had conformations the same as those observed in the present study (data not

shown). Thus, it is suggested that the structural changes between the oxyHb and met(A1-oxy)Hb may not be caused by a pH change but by ligand-induced rearrangement. In our previous study, crystals were obtained in an oxygenated state when a long period was required for sufficient crystal growth. The probability that our previously reported structure of the oxyHb was in a mixed oxidation state is not perfectly excluded. Nevertheless, the ratio of the met state was thought to be very small because the bright red color of the crystals and the structural conformation were significantly different from those found in the present study of the met(A1-oxy)Hb. Minor contaminants in the crystallization solution such as lipids might prevent preferentially oxidation of the heme, since

Comparisons of the EF-dimer structures of Oligobrachia Hb. A: Superpositions of the A1B1 dimer of the met(A1-oxy)Hb (blue) to that of the oxyHb (yellow). Ca atoms of only the A1 subunits were included in the calculation of these superimposed structures. A close-up view of the interface region of the dimer structure composed of the E and F helices is presented in the upper panel. The well-conserved residues (Arg E10, His F3, and Gln F7) among giant Hbs coming into contact with the heme group of the neighboring subunit are also shown as sticks together with the hemes. The lower panel represents a superposition of the overall dimeric structures by the Ca trace models and stick models of the hemes. The bottom subunits indicate rearrangement of the quaternary structure (black arrow) caused by a large movement of the AB loop region. The E and F helices are labeled. B: Superpositions of the A2B2 dimer are drawn the same as (A). The superposition was performed on the Ca atoms of the A2 subunits. His F3 is replaced with Arg in the A2 subunit.

the second column chromatography step was omitted in the previous study. Strongly bound oxygen at the A1 ligand site [Fig. 4(C)] is highly stabilized by Phe32 (B10). From mutagenesis analysis of sperm whale Mb, it has been suggested that the Phe residue at the B10 position greatly increases oxygen affinity due to stabilizing interactions between the negative portion of oxygen and the relatively positively charged edge of the aromatic ring.37 In addition, Phe at B10 remarkably reduces the rate of autoxidation.37 Amino acid sequence alignments of the Hbs of siboglinid polychaetes and annelid show a high occurrence of aromatic residues (Phe or Trp) in the B10 positions of all subunits among these animals, which may cause the high oxygen affinity and the autoxidation resistance of Hbs of these animals.14 The Phe B10 of the A1 subunit seems to take a most suitable geometry for stabilization of the oxygen molecule. The distance between the O(2) and Cf ° atoms of 3.5 A and the angle between oxygen and the Phe ring plane of nearly 08, which are almost identical to ° the reported ideal values of 3.6 A and 08.38 In contrast, the superposition of four subunits reveals that the geometries of the Phe B10 in the B1 and B2 subunits (Trp ° B10 in the A2 subunit) show some deviations (0.3­0.6 A

and 10­208) from the above ideal values. The optimum geometry of Phe B10 of the A1 subunit and the bound oxygen molecule could prevent the ligand from dissociating and the heme iron from oxidation. Moreover, it is likely that Phe46 (CD1) of the A1 subunit also contributes to further stabilization of the oxygen ligand. These tight interactions could lead to the A1 subunit alone maintaining its oxygenated form. The electron density inconsistencies in the B1 subunit clearly indicate the existence of an isoform of the B1 subunit. Because the molecular threefold and twofold axes are both parallel to the crystallographic symmetry axes, there are three possibilities for constructing the whole 24mer assembly of the giant Hb molecule with two B1 isoforms. The first and most possible situation is that the B1a and B1b subunits are randomly used in the whole molecule and exist with a $50% probability in the giant Hb. The second possibility is that particular B1 positions in the 24mer molecule are occupied by the B1a subunit and the others by the B1b subunit. But the global symmetry of Oligobrachia Hb enables it to pack in six rotational orientations. The last possibility is that one molecule is composed of only B1a subunits of all six B1 positions in the 24mer, while the other molecule consists of

only the B1b subunits. The crystals are a mixture of these two types of giant Hbs. However, we have not yet identified the coelomic Hb of O. mashikoi, because it is anatomically and technically difficult to separate the blood and coelomic fluid. While the physiological role of isoforms of the B1 subunit remains unclear, it is noteworthy that the 10 substituted residues of the B1 subunit are placed primarily at the molecular surface. Environmental differences in B1 gene expression have been reported in

Ridgeia piscesae (hydrothermal vent tube worm).39 Variations in the expression of the B1 isoforms of tube worms and beard worms might play a role in adjustment to the local environment. More tight conformations than oxygenated forms are generally observed in all known crystal structures of origomeric deoxyHbs (HbA, Scapharca HbI, and lamprey Hb40). Our findings suggest that the common dodecameric assembly of giant Hbs of annelids and siboglinid

polychaetes also form tighter conformations when in an unliganded state. The low affinity state of these giant Hbs may be primarily caused by the rearrangements of well-conserved Val E11, which reduce the space for ligand molecules in the distal pockets. Slight movements of the B helices cause small rearrangements of Phe or Trp at the B10 position, and these changes may also lower the ligand affinity. Based on knowledge of the well-studied cooperative Hbs, it has been suggested that contacts between the E and F helices, and the FG loop region are of primary importance in the cooperative effect. The results of Oligobrachia met(A1-oxy)Hb indicate an additional importance of the AB loop region in the cooperative mechanisms of the dodecameric assembly of giant Hbs in annelida.
