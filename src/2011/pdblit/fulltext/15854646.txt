cell death systems that favor plasmid-carrying cells by killing bacteria that did not inherit a plasmid copy at cell division4­6. Table 1 is a nonexhaustive list of characterized programmed cell death systems, which are also called addiction, toxin­antidote or postsegregational killing systems. The F plasmid encodes three such systems: flm (F leading maintenance)7, srn (stable RNA degradation)8 and ccd. These systems function independently and differ in their effectiveness as post-segregational killing systems6,9. The best-documented plasmid- and chromosomeencoded programmed cell death systems are composed of two elements: a stable toxin and an unstable component ­ the antidote (protein or RNA) ­ that prevents expression of the toxin, neutralizes it or protects its bacterial target. In plasmid-carrying cells, both toxin and antidote are synthesized and the cells remain viable. In plasmid-cured bacteria, de novo synthesis of the plasmid-encoded toxin­antidote pair ceases and, as a result of decay or dilution of the antidote, the more stable toxin is able to exert its toxicity, causing cell death. Figure 1 shows a general scheme of how a protein-based toxin­antidote system functions. In the case of the ccd system, the CcdA antidote is degraded by the ATP-dependent protease Lon (Ref. 10). Lon has an important regulatory function in E. coli: it fine-tunes the amounts of several specific proteins involved in switching regulatory cascades off and on and also plays a housekeeping function, eliminating abnormal or misfolded proteins11. Lon substrates usually have very short half-lifes (a few

minutes). This is in contrast to the half-life of the CcdA antidote, which is estimated at ~1 h in the presence of CcdB (Ref. 10). Long half-lifes have also been found for other antidotes, such as PemI and Phd, which appear to represent a new class of substrates for ATP-dependent proteases (Table 1). Given the essential function played by antidotes, slow degradation might be necessary to minimize killing of plasmid-containing bacteria in response to environmental perturbations that could activate proteolysis, such as temperature shock. The CcdB toxin: a new gyrase poison and inhibitor The ccd module, located in the mini-F replicon of the F plasmid, is composed of the two genes ccdA and ccdB (also called H and G or letA and letB), which encode two small proteins: the CcdA antidote (8.7 kDa) and the CcdB toxin (11.7 kDa)12,13. Both genes are organized in an operon together with the resolvase-encoding gene D (Ref. 14). This operon is downregulated by a complex of the two Ccd proteins15. When its action is not prevented by the CcdA antidote, CcdB causes reduced DNA synthesis16, activation of the SOS regulon17, cell filamentation13, formation of anucleate cells16 and cell death16. In an attempt to identify the target of CcdB, bacterial mutants resistant18 or tolerant19 to its lethal activity were isolated and were found to affect the gyrA gene. Gyrase belongs to a class of essential and highly conserved enzymes that are present in all living organisms: the topoisomerases20,21. By introducing a transient double-strand break in their DNA

The toxin is neutralized by the antidote and the cells are viable.

As the antidote is unstable and degraded by a specific protease, the toxin can interact with its target, causing cell death.

substrate, passing another piece of DNA through the break and resealing it (Fig. 2), these enzymes relieve topological constraints caused by transcription and replication complexes moving along the DNA. They also display decatenation activity that resolves interlinked DNA molecules. E. coli gyrase is a tetramer formed by the association of two GyrA (97 kDa) and two GyrB (90 kDa) subunits. Bacterial gyrases are unique among topoisomerases in that they can catalyze negative supercoiling at the expense of ATP hydrolysis22. The GyrA subunits form the catalytic core of the enzyme and ensure the DNA breaking­ rejoining reactions, whereas the GyrB subunits are responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. In prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the breaking­ rejoining reaction intermediates (named cleavable or cleaved complexes; see Figs 2b,c) are the target of potent therapeutic agents, such as quinolones and several antitumor drugs. Quinolones stabilize the cleaved complexes, resulting in DNA lesions that prevent the passage of DNA and RNA polymerases23. Attempts to bypass or repair these DNA lesions are thought to

trigger SOS induction, as well as various pathways leading to double-strand breaks and cell death24. In E. coli, CcdB appears to have two activities. First, CcdB traps and poisons the cleaved DNA­ gyrase complexes18,25 and blocks the passage of E. coli and T7 polymerases26. This strongly suggests that CcdB kills via gyrase in a similar manner to quinolones: by causing DNA lesions leading to double-strand breaks. However, convincing genetic18 and biochemical25,27 evidence supports the view that CcdB and quinolones trap different intermediates of the cleaved complex. For example, quinolone- and CcdB-resistant mutations map to different domains of GyrA (Fig. 2). Moreover, cross resistance between quinolones and CcdB is not observed18. In addition, CcdB is reported to be a direct inhibitor of gyrase28. In cells that overproduce CcdB, plasmid DNA is relaxed and the free GyrA subunits form a complex with CcdB. In the presence of GyrB and ATP, these purified GyrA­CcdB complexes are unable to catalyze supercoiling or DNA cleavage. Poisoning and inhibition of gyrase by CcdB are

Fig. 2. A molecular model for the catalytic cycle of gyrase. (a) Gyrase binds to a DNA segment (light blue and white) as a tetramer; two GyrA subunits (dark blue) and two GyrB subunits (yellow) wrap a DNA segment (~130 bp) into a positive supercoil. The gyrase catalyzes the breakage of a segment of this wrapped DNA (called the DNA gate or G-segment), the passage of a segment from the same DNA molecule through the break (called the DNA transfer or T-segment) and religation of the break. The relative positions of the G- and T-segments and part of the GyrA head dimer domain (red circle) involved in the breaking­rejoining reactions are indicated on the complex shown in parentheses. This GyrA domain contains the active site Tyr122 (see below) and the mutations leading to quinolone resistance. For clarity, the DNA G- and T-segments are represented in a linear form in parts (b)­(d). (b) When ATP binds to the GyrB subunits, conformational changes occur. GyrB subunits dimerize and capture the T-segment. Concomitantly, a transient double-strand break is introduced into the DNA G-segment. The 5 phosphate termini of the broken DNA G-segment are covalently linked to the GyrA Tyr122. (c) The T-segment is transported through the broken G-segment into the central hole of the GyrA dimer. The cleaved complexes are shown in parts (b) and (c). CcdB probably traps the intermediate shown in step (c). In contrast, the quinolones trap a cleaved complex without the need of T-segment passage28. (d) After T-segment passage, the G-segment is religated, and the T-segment is released through a transient opening of the primary dimer interface of the GyrA dimer. The green arrows in parts (b) and (d) indicate the direction of T-segment passage. Religation of the DNA break results in the introduction of two negative supercoils. ATP hydrolysis promotes enzyme turnover and regenerates the starting state. Adapted from Refs 31,45.

suppressed by the same mutations in GyrA (Arg462 to Cys in GyrA, leading to resistance to CcdB)25,26 and in CcdB (mutations in the three carboxy-terminal amino acids that inactivate the killing phenotype of CcdB)29. This strongly suggests that both activities of CcdB involve the formation of a similar GyrA­CcdB complex (E.M. Bahassi et al., unpublished). The CcdA antidote not only prevents this complex formation but also releases CcdB from the inactive GyrA­CcdB complex and from the cleaved GyrA­ CcdB­DNA complex by forming a tight CcdA­CcdB complex25,30. Recently, and independently, the crystal structure of a large fragment of GyrA (59 kDa of the aminoterminal region of GyrA)31,32 and of CcdB (R. Loris

et al., submitted) have been determined. Both mechanistic26 and structural studies have led to a model for GyrA­CcdB complex formation (R. Loris et al., submitted; Fig. 3). Arg462 in GyrA is known to play an essential role in GyrA­CcdB complex formation25. Its side chain appears to point into the central hole of the GyrA dimer, near the primary dimer interface (Fig. 3a), suggesting that CcdB could bind and block the central hole of the GyrA dimer. As this hole is slightly too small to accommodate a dimer of CcdB (Fig. 3a), formation of a GyrA­CcdB complex should require opening up, to some degree, of the GyrA dimer. This could happen in two situations: (1) CcdB could interact with GyrA during GyrA synthesis before the dimer is formed, producing an inactive

GyrA­CcdB complex (i.e. the inhibition activity of CcdB) and (2) CcdB could target GyrA when gyrase is cycling on the DNA, freezing the cycle at some stage of the T-segment passage, thus causing DNA lesions (i.e. the poisoning activity of CcdB) (Fig. 3b). In an extensive search for all the host factors involved in CcdB killing, other E. coli mutants able to survive low concentrations of CcdB (e.g. CcdB expressed from a low-copy-number F plasmid carrying an amber mutation in the ccdA gene) have been isolated; the genes affected are groE (Ref. 33), pmbA and tldD (Ref. 34). Inactivation of a fourth gene, csrA (encoding a carbon-storage regulator), reverses the tolerance phenotype of these three mutant types34. How the corresponding gene products affect synthesis, folding or the interactions between GyrA, CcdB and CcdA is not yet understood. A two-edged sword: topoisomerase poisons as a drug Quinolones represent one of the best classes of antibacterial drug. The considerable success of these synthetic products can be attributed to their broad activity spectra, minimal toxicity towards eukaryotes, ease of penetration into most bacterial cells and good pharmacokinetic properties. The excellent performance of these antibiotics has led to their overuse and misuse, with the inevitable response: drug resistance. Antibiotic resistance in bacterial species commonly results from resistance genes on transmissible plasmids or moveable transposons, but quinolone resistance is chromosomal. Its emergence and spread was expected to be slow but this has turned out to be an optimistic prediction. Quinolone resistance is already a major problem in some Gram-positive species (especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and occurs increasingly regularly in several Gramnegative species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.35 Trapping of the cleaved topoisomerase­DNA complex is the first of an intricate series of events (notably, SOS induction and illegitimate recombination) leading to genetic instability (i.e. point and frame-shift mutations, deletions and major DNA rearrangements) and/or cell death24. This is the two-edged sword of the activity of the quinolones: their high cytotoxicity makes them potent antibiotics, yet through their mutagenic effects they may accelerate the emergence of resistance to their own action. Another factor that has to be taken into account is that in patients treated with these potent drugs, it is not only the targeted pathogen that is affected. The entire nonpathogenic bacterial flora undergoes a dramatic genetic revolution. Considering the multifactorial and modular character of bacterial virulence, quinolone-induced and gyrase-mediated illegitimate recombination may participate in the emergence of new combinations of virulence factors. Quinolone antibiotics should therefore be used with considerable care and, to conserve their therapeutic potential, usage should be restricted to humans.

The carboxy-terminal -helix of CcdB (where the mutations that inactivate the killing phenotype of CcdB are located) is in close proximity to Arg462. Binding of CcdB to this conformation would prevent closure of the head dimer interface and, consequently, religation of the DNA G-segment, resulting in a trapped cleaved complex. (R. Loris et al., submitted.)

Diversification of antibiotic development is important. Promising candidates for development into clinically useful antibiotics not only include improved quinolone derivatives36 but also natural toxins targeting bacterial topoisomerases, such as CcdB, microcin B17 and clerocidin37,38. These natural toxins target different domains of the GyrA and GyrB proteins compared with the quinolones, and no cross

resistance with quinolones has been observed. Their analysis will be invaluable for the completion of our mechanistic and structural understanding of the gyrase reactions, which in turn could provide important clues for designing new therapeutic drugs targeting DNA topoisomerase. In addition, these toxins may help elucidate the complex pathway leading from stabilization of the cleaved DNA­topoisomerase complex to the mechanisms of cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. Programmed cell death versus diversity Surprisingly, some plasmid-encoded programmed cell death systems have several analogs on the bacterial chromosome (Table 1). Why are there so many suicide modules and what selective advantage do they confer? Current hypotheses stem from the pioneering work of Shapiro, who countered the generally accepted view that bacterial colonies are composed of identical individuals39. He convincingly demonstrated that bacterial populations constitute organized multicell structures in which individuals undergo epigenetic and genetic variation. In the context of a differentiated multicellular `organism', the presence of multiple programmed cell death systems makes more sense. When a bacterial population is threatened (e.g. by starvation, desiccation, viral infection, antibiotics or pollutants), the death of particular subpopulations could benefit the species, notably by providing food for the survivors or by aborting viral infection5,40. Different programmed cell death systems may be induced by different stresses. This is an interesting framework for further investigation. Among the F plasmid-encoded programmed cell death systems, ccd is a poor killer9,41. It seems inconceivable that its only role in nature is to stabilize the F plasmid, especially as this plasmid is richly endowed with other efficient stabilizing control mechanisms (Table 1). As the CcdB toxin, like the quinolones, creates lesions in DNA and induces the SOS regulon, perhaps part of its role is to generate genetic diversity in the part of the bacterial population that does not inherit the F plasmid. While it is a disadvantage in quinolone therapy (drug-resistant individuals being immediately selected), introduction of genetic diversity by ccd in a small fraction of the bacterial popuQuestions for future research
· Why do plasmids and chromosomes encode so many programmed cell death mechanisms? Are they suicide and/or mutagenic systems induced under diverse physiological conditions? Do they ensure species survival by killing or promoting adaptation of a fraction of the bacterial population? · What is the pathway(s) leading from CcdB­ and quinolone­ DNA­gyrase complexes to mutagenicity and cell death? · Can CcdB and microcin B17 help researchers to design novel peptide-based antibiotics? · Can we create new antibiotics to target gyrase that are highly cytotoxic but have reduced mutagenic properties? · Can we design novel classes of antibiotics based on the discovery and the study of new programmed cell death systems?

lation should enrich the genetic potential of the species for adaptation. Exploitation of the ccd system All the non-killer ccdB mutants isolated so far are affected in the region spanning the three carboxyterminal residues of CcdB, indicating the importance of this region in the killing function29. Yet CcdB can tolerate significant changes at many positions in its amino-terminal region without losing its lethal potential. This feature was taken advantage of to construct cloning vectors that allow selection for recombinants. These positive-selection vectors rely on the insertional inactivation of the cytotoxic ccdB gene42. The introduction of an insert into a multiple cloning site located within the 5 end of a fused ccdB gene results in the sole recovery of E. coli bearing vectors with an insert. During recent decades, Gram-negative bacterial species other than E. coli have aroused increasing interest because of their involvement in biological processes of agricultural, environmental, industrial or medical importance. To facilitate both cloning in E. coli and characterization of the cloned genes in their original host or hosts of interest, derived positive-selection vectors were constructed with transfer properties and with different host ranges and copy numbers43. Conclusions Bacterial DNA gyrases are unique among topoisomerases in that they introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA molecules22. This property appears to be attributable to the capacity of gyrase, in contrast to other topoisomerases, to wrap a DNA segment around the carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain of its GyrA subunits44. This special feature makes DNA gyrase a good target for specific antibacterial drugs with minimal toxicity towards eukaryotic topoisomerases. The natural CcdB toxin has been revealed as a specific poison of bacterial gyrases ­ potent against the gyrases of several Gramnegative bacteria43 but unable to interact with eukaryotic topoisomerases (Y. Pommier, unpublished). Recent insights into the mechanistic and structural interactions of CcdB with gyrase may provide new clues for designing peptide-based drugs that target DNA gyrase. The global overuse and misuse of antibiotics in animal nutrition and care and in human medicine have led, in just over half a century, to the widespread development of multidrug resistance among bacterial pathogens. This phenomenon has become a major problem in public health. In past decades, multidrug resistance was most successfully countered by modifying existing antibiotics. Excellent examples are the multiple derivatives of -lactamase and quinolone antibiotics with increased therapeutic performance, which are often able to overcome bacterial resistance to earlier compounds. The search for novel antibacterial agents has so far yielded limited results. Bacteria and their plasmids, in their fight for survival in nature, have designed thousands of compounds with

antibacterial activity. These natural toxins, including those encoded by the recently discovered programmed cell death systems, certainly represent an enormous reservoir of potential antibiotics. One must bear in mind, however, that developing a new therapeutic drug is a long, costly process. In contrast, bacteria have an astounding capacity to evolve resistance determinants in a very short time. Human carelessness is often to blame. To avoid wasting time and resources and to produce effective, lasting weapons against bacterial aggression, it is paramount to control the use of new antibiotics and to restrict them to human medicine.
