The substrate activity screening (SAS) method, a substrate-based fragment identification and optimization method for the development of enzyme inhibitors, was previously applied to cathepsin S to obtain a novel (2-arylphenoxy)acetaldehyde inhibitor, 2, with a 0.49 µM Ki value (Wood, W. J. L.; Patterson, A. W.; Tsuruoka, H.; Jain, R. K.; Ellman, J. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 15521-15527). In this paper we disclose the X-ray structure of a complex between cathepsin S and inhibitor 2 which reveals an unprecedented binding mode. On the basis of this structure, additional 2-biaryloxy substrates with greatly increased cleavage efficiency were designed. Conversion of the optimized substrates to the corresponding aldehyde inhibitors yielded a low molecular weight (304 Daltons) and potent (9.6 nM) cathepsin S inhibitor that showed from 100- to >1000-fold selectivity relative to cathepsins B, L, and K.
Introduction Recently, we disclosed a new method called substrate activity screening (SAS) for the substrate-based identification of novel fragments that bind to serine or cysteine protease targets.1,2 This method further enables the subsequent conversion of identified binding fragments to novel and low molecular weight mechanism-based protease inhibitors. In the first application of the SAS method,1 two distinct nonpeptidic aldehyde inhibitors (Figure 1) were identified to the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin S, which is expressed in antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. Cathepsin S degrades the MHCa class II-associated invariant chain that is required for productive loading of antigen onto the MHC class II complex, and therefore, inhibition of cathepsin S may be useful for attenuating antigen presentation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.3 More recently, we reported on further optimization of the potency and selectivity of inhibitor 1.4 Here we report that the crystal structure of cathepsin S in complex with 2 establishes that this novel inhibitor, which lacks nitrogen functionality or chiral centers, has an unprecedented binding mode. Moreover, this structural information has provided the basis for the development of a low molecular weight (304 Daltons) inhibitor with a low nanomolar Ki value and from 100- to >1000-fold selectivity relative to the closely related enzymes cathepsins B, L, and K.

Chemistry Central to the synthesis of analogues of 2 was the preparation of the appropriately substituted arylboronic acids that were needed for Suzuki cross-coupling reactions to prepare the biaryl frameworks. Accordingly, ortholithiation of 1,2-difluorobenzene with n-butyllithium in TMEDA/THF followed by addition of the requisite alkyl iodide provided the orthoalkylated difluorobenzenes 3 with high levels of regiocontrol (Scheme 1).5 A second fluorine-directed ortholithiation followed by reaction with B(OMe)3 and aqueous workup then provided the desired arylboronic acids 4. For the synthesis of the 2-arylphenoxy substrates, two approaches were taken. In the first approach (Scheme 2), Suzuki cross-coupling reactions were performed between arylboronic acids 4a and 4b and 2-bromophenol to provide the 2-arylphenols 5a and 5b. For the synthesis of 5f (Scheme 2), Suzuki cross-coupling was performed with 4 (R ) OMe), which was prepared by literature methods.6 The support-bound 7-(chloroacetamido)coumarin 61 was then alkylated with the phenols 5 mediated by the strong base 2-(tert-butylimino)-2-(diethylamino)-1,3-dimethylperhydro1,3,2-diazaphosphorine (BEMP) to provide the support-bound substrates 7. Cleavage from the support with trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2 then provided the desired substrates 8. The second method for preparing 2-arylphenoxy substrates 8 was carried out in solution (Scheme 3). Suzuki cross-coupling of 4 with commercially available 9 provided 10, which either could be taken on to substrate 8 (Scheme 3) or could be readily converted to the corresponding aldehyde inhibitor (vide infra). Saponification of 10 followed by coupling with 7-amino-4methylcoumarin acetic acid ethyl ester provided 11, which upon saponification provided the desired substrate 8. The synthesis

of the aldehyde inhibitors 12 could readily be achieved by diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) reduction of the latestage intermediate 10 (Scheme 4). Results and Discussion Proteases uniformly recognize their substrates as strands in their active sites.7 Consequently, peptide backbone hydrogenbonding is featured prominently in substrate and inhibitor binding interactions. In contrast, the novel inhibitor 2 lacks amide NH groups or alternative hydrogen bond donors. Moreover, H-bond-accepting interactions typically provided by the amide carbonyls or heterocyclic isosteres of protease substrates or inhibitors are also absent. The structure of 2 therefore suggests that its binding interactions with cathepsin S would be quite distinct from that typically observed for peptidic or peptidomimetic inhibitors. A crystal structure of 2 in complex with cathepsin S was therefore obtained to determine its mode of binding. Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 1. Indeed, as illustrated in the crystal structure (Figure 2), inhibitor 2 has a very distinctive mode of binding. While the aldehyde pharmacophore shows the expected tetrahedral adduct with the active site cysteine, the inhibitor does not make any interactions with the S1 and S3 pockets, which typically accommodate the P1

defined by residues Phe 70, Met 71, Val 162, and Val 135Gly 137 (Figure 2c). These contacts are consistent with previously reported substrate and inhibitor SAR, indicating the importance of the binding interactions provided by the fluorine substituents: removal of the 4-fluoro substituent from 2 reduces Ki by 2.5-fold and replacement of all three fluoro substituents reduces Ki by 80-fold.1 The 2- and 3-fluoro groups are likely to contribute binding interactions and specificity via weak hydrogen bond interactions with the main chain amides of Gly 165 and Gly 69, respectively (Figure 2b). Importantly, the structure suggests numerous opportunities for enhancing the potency of inhibitor 2 by extending into the S1, S2, and S3 pockets. Designing inhibitors that extend into the S2 pocket provides a particularly attractive means to achieve selectivity relative to cathepsin B, and more significantly cathepsins L and K, which have particularly high homology with cathepsin S, because Gly 137 contributes to the wall of the S2 pocket, while for cathepsins B, L, and K the larger Ala residue is located at this site. As previously reported in the development of inhibitors 1 and 2,1 and in the further optimization of 1,4 outstanding correlation between substrate cleavage efficiency and inhibitory activity was observed. Substrate analogues were therefore first prepared to evaluate the effect of introducing substituents that extend into the S2 pocket (Table 2). Replacing the 4-fluoro substituent with alkyl or ether substituents would provide an effective means to append functionality that might interact with the hydrophobic S2 pocket. Two analogues, 8f and 8c, with methoxy and ethyl groups at the 4-position, respectively (entries 2 and 3), were first prepared and evaluated as substrates to identify whether an ether or alkyl group would provide the most effective linkage strategy. While the methoxy analogue 8f showed a 10-fold reduction in substrate cleavage efficiency (entry 2) relative to that of the benchmark substrate 13 (entry 1), the ethyl derivative 8c was a substrate comparable in efficiency to 13 (entry 3). These results are consistent with the hydrophobic contacts made by the 4-fluoro group in the

cocrystal structure of 2 (Figure 2). Because 8c was a more efficient substrate than 8f, an alkyl linkage was employed for all additional analogues designed to extend into the S2 pocket. As shown in entry 4, compound 8d with R ) n-propyl was cleaved 5-fold more efficiently than compound 13, while 8a with R ) n-butyl was cleaved only 3-fold more efficiently (entry 5). Introducing branching to provide 8e with R ) isobutyl (entry 6) provided the greatest enhancement in cleavage efficiency (>10-fold) relative to that of 13. However, branched substrate 8b incorporating a cyclohexylmethyl substituent showed reduced activity and serves to define the size of the pocket (entry 7). The aldehyde inhibitors corresponding to the two substrates with the highest cleavage efficiency were prepared, and their inhibitory activities were determined (Table 3). Aldehyde 12d showed 10-fold greater potency than inhibitor 2, and aldehyde 12e, which corresponds to the best substrate, was 50-fold more potent with a 9.6 nM Ki value. On the basis of the crystal structure, the propyl and isobutyl substituents of 12d and 12e, respectively, would be expected to interact with Gly 137 in cathepsin S. Because Ala is present at the corresponding site in cathepsins B, L, and K, an increase in selectivity could be anticipated. Indeed, while 2 was only marginally selective for cathepsin S over cathepsin K and cathepsin L, replacing the 4-fluoro group with the alkyl side chains resulted in dramatic improvements in selectivity, with inhibitor 12e showing >100fold selectivity for cathepsin K and >1000-fold selectivity for cathepsins B and L (Table 3). In conclusion, the structure of novel, nonpeptidic inhibitor 2 in complex with cathepsin S has been reported and shows a binding mode that is distinct from that observed for peptidic and peptidomimetic inhibitors. The structural information guided the design of aldehyde inhibitor 12e, which is both potent (Ki ) 9.6 nM) and selective (from 100- to >1000-fold selectivity

relative to cathepsins K, L, and B). The structure of 2 in complex with cathepsin S suggests additional opportunities for enhancing potency and selectivity. The S3 pocket, which is unoccupied, provides a clear opportunity for introducing additional binding interactions. Moreover, the low molecular weight of 12e enables the aldehyde pharmacophore to be replaced by more metabolically stable covalent8 or noncovalent9,10 pharmacophores that extend into the prime binding pockets, a strategy that has proven to be successful in recent cathepsin S and K inhibitor development efforts.

The purity of the compound was checked by RP-HPLC (see the Supporting Information for MeOH/H2O/TFA and MeCN/H2O/TFA HPLC traces). General Assay Procedure. Cathepsins B, K, L, and S were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Cbz-Leu-Arg-AMC, Cbz-Phe-Arg-AMC, l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-Leu-4-guanidinobutylamide (E-64), and l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-Leu-3-methylbutylamide (E-64c) were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). The proteolytic cleavage of N-acylaminocoumarins by cathepsin S was conducted in Dynatech Microfluor fluorescence 96-well microtiter plates, and readings were taken on a Molecular Devices Spectra Max Gemini XS instrument. The excitation wavelength was 370 nm and the emission wavelength was 455 nm with a cutoff of 435 nm for AMCA substrates; the excitation wavelength was 355 nm and the emission wavelength was 450 nm for peptidyl-AMC substrates. The assay buffer consisted of a 100 mM solution of pH 6.1 sodium phosphate buffer with 100 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.001% Tween-20. Assay Procedure for AMCA Substrates. Assays were conducted at 37 °C in duplicate with and without the enzyme. In each well were placed 38 µL of enzyme solution and 2 µL of a DMSO substrate solution. Assays were performed at substrate concentrations that were at minimum 6 times less than the KM for that substrate, and assays were performed in duplicate. Relative fluorescent units (RFUs) were measured at regular intervals over a period of time (maximum 15 min). A plot of RFUs versus time was made for each substrate with and without cathepsin S. The slope of the plotted line gave Vmax/KM of each substrate for cathepsin S. Using the RFUs per micromolar concentration for AMCA, substrate concentration, and enzyme concentration determined by E-64c titration for cathepsin S,12 kcat/KM was determined. Assay Procedure for Inhibitors. The dissociation constants (Ki) were determined from the IC50 values taken from plots of Vi/Vo versus inhibitor concentration, where Vo is the velocity in the absence of the inhibitor and Vi is the velocity with the inhibitor. Because the substrate concentration is significantly below KM, the IC50 values were converted to Ki by the equation Ki ) IC50 - Et/2, where Et ) enzyme concentration.13 The cathepsin B concentration in the assays was 2 nM, that of cathepsin K was 10 nM, that of cathepsin L was 0.025 nM, and that of cathepsin S was 0.7 nM. The following concentrations for the fluorogenic substrates were used: (Cbz-Phe-Arg-AMC) 2.5 µM for cathepsins B and K, 0.3 µM for cathepsin L; (Cbz-Leu-Arg-AMC) 2.5 µM for cathepsin S. Assays were conducted in duplicate with and without inhibitor at five inhibitor concentrations to provide 10-90% enzyme inhibition. In each well were placed 180 µL of enzyme solution and 10 µL of a DMSO inhibitor solution. The resulting solutions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, then 10 µL of the peptidyl-AMC substrate was added, and generation of AMC was monitored over 5 min. Crystallization and Data Collection. Cathepsin S was expressed in the baculovirus system and its complex with inhibitor 2, produced by adding 2 to the protein in a 2/1 molar ratio prior to concentration of the protein to 15 mg/mL. A coarse screen of 480 crystallization conditions was set up in low-profile 96-well Greiner plates at 4 °C in a sitting drop format containing 250 nL of protein combined

with an equal volume of crystallization solution. Small crystals (20 µm) appeared after 1-2 weeks in a solution of 0.1 M sodium acetate, 20% Peg-8000, and 2.0 M LiSO4. Data were collected at beamline 5.0.3 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley, CA. The crystal form belongs to space group P4122 and diffracted to 1.6 Å resolution (dataset statistics are presented in Table 1). This tetragonal crystal form was isomorphous with a previously determined crystal form.9,3 The structure was then iteratively refined until convergence with Coot14 and Refmac5;15 all other crystallographic manipulations were carried out with the CCP4 program package.16 The refined structure exhibited excellent geometry with no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). Excellent agreement was observed between the conformations of inhibitor 2 in the two molecules of the asymmetric unit although the presence of an alternative conformation of Cys 25 of molecule B and less defined electron density of the compound suggest that inhibitor 2 was not at full occupancy within this monomer. The structure was deposited with PDB code 2OP3.
