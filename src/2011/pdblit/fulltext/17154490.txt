The compound behaved as an antagonist in a cell transactivation assay, and in a first in vivo experiment in rats.

Nuclear hormone receptors comprise a class of intracellular, ligand activated transcription factors, which include receptors for thyroid hormones (THsa). Thyroid receptors (TRs) exert profound effects on development and homeostasis in mammals.1 Endogenous THs, 3,5,3,5-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (T4, 1a), 3,5,3triiodo-L-thyronine (T3, 1b) (Figure 1), and its metabolites, regulate crucial genes throughout the organism and influence basal and adaptive metabolism, lipid levels, bone and muscle metabolism, heart rate, development, mood, and overall sense of well being. When the body is exposed to elevated levels of circulating 1a and 1b, this might result in hyperthyroidism. Clinically, this state often manifests itself by weight loss, hypermetabolism, lowering of serum lipid levels, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, muscle weakness, bone loss in postmenopausal women, and anxiety. At present, treatment of hyperthyroidism is directed to reduce overproduction of THs by inhibiting their synthesis or release or by ablating thyroid tissue with surgery or radioiodine. TR antagonists may have significant clinical use such as for treating hormone excess states, as it might quickly restore the euthyroid state and consequently improve the clinical manifestations mentioned above. Several crystallographic structures of the ligand binding domains (LBDs) have been determined for TR agonists, but none include a TR antagonist.2-9 Therefore, certain assumptions have to be made in terms of the design of new TR antagonists. In the literature, ligand design of TR antagonists has generally been based on the attachment of a large extension group at the 5-position of 1b or other close analogues. This extension is

believed to distort the folding of the C-terminal helix (helix 12) to the body of the LBD and thus the formation of the coactivator site. We prefer to describe this class of compounds as "direct antagonists" in order to separate them from "indirect" or "passive" antagonists.10 Examples of synthetic TR antagonists using this "extension theory" is depicted in Figure 1 by the extensively studied O-[4-hydroxy-3,5-diisopropylphenyl]-Ltyrosine11-17 (2), 3,5-dibromo-4-(3,5-diisopropylphenoxy)benzoic acid18 (3), {4-[4-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)benzyl]-3,5-dimethylphenoxy}acetic acid (4),19 and {4-[4-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-5-(4-nitrophenylethynyl)benzyl]-3,5-dimethylphenoxy}acetic acid (5).20-21 In order to optimize drug feasibility by increasing water solubility, we decided to substitute the R5-position with a pyridyl vinyl group. Furthermore, the alkynyl part in 5 can be problematic because it potentially can ring-close with the R4hydroxy to form a benzofuran ring at elevated pH,22 perceptibly not possible with an alkene group. We have also previously showed that affinity for TR increases in the order formic, acetic, and propionic acids and that accompanying optimal substitution patterns for affinity and stability involve bromine groups at the R3 and R5 positions and an isopropyl group at the R3-position.6 Structure-based design work intended for the displacement of helix-12 (H12) revealed that a viable substitution of the R5position indeed could be accomplished through the use of a pyridylvinyl group. The alkene part extends precisely through a well-defined hole between helix-3 and helix-11, and the terminal pyridyl group is directed into H12, thus potentially distorting the folding of H12 to the body of the LBD (Figure 2).23 The designed ligand, 3-{3,5-dibromo-4-[4-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-5-((E)-2-pyridin-4-ylvinyl)phenoxy]phenyl}propionic acid (6), was prepared as outlined in Scheme 1. The starting material, methyl 3-[3,5-dibromo-4-(3-isopropyl-4-methoxyphenoxy)phenyl]propionate (7),24 was regioselectively nitrated at the R5position, the nitro group reduced, diazotizated, and substituted with potassium iodide to give the intermediate methyl 3-[3,5-

Hydrogen bonds between the ligand and protein are represented by dashed yellow lines, and the surface of the ligand binding cavity is represented as a yellow mesh. There is a severe steric clash between the 5-substituent of 6 and the agonist conformation of H12, which forces H12 into the antagonist conformation.

dibromo-4-(3-iodo-5-isopropyl-4-methoxyphenoxy)phenyl]propionate (8) in moderate yield. After deprotection, the final product 6 was obtained in good yields via a regioselective crosscoupling between the R5-iodo and 4-pyridylvinyl. Total yields from the starting material 7, using six synthetic steps, were 15% for 6. The results of a binding assay for the human TRR1 and TR 1 for 3-6 and the indirect antagonist 3-(3,5-dibromo-4-cyclohexylmethoxyphenyl)propionic acid (9)10 are summarized in Table 1. Compound 6 displayed high affinity for both TRR1 and TR 1 and represents with respect to TRR1-binding an improvement of affinity compared with the previously known high-affinity ligands 4 and 5. Furthermore, 6, in contrast to 4 and 5, does not appear to be selective for either TR isoform, which is likely to be an advantage when treating the hyperthyroid state. Also, with the present binding data at hand for the high-affinity "direct antagonists" 4-6, the value of the design approach of indirect TR antagonists appears at least in this context as somewhat less valuable. The viability of this approach

warrants, however, further investigation and continued structureactivity relationship work. The result from a reporter cell assay employing CHO K1 cells (Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells) stably transfected with hTRR1 and an alkaline phosphate reporter gene downstream the thyroid response element (TRAFR1), is shown in Figure 3. Clearly 6 acts as a full antagonist in the TRAFR cell assay and the IC50 for TRAF was similar to that for TRAFR. The IC50 values were 32 nM for both TRAFR1 and TRAF 1. In order to confirm the antagonism of 6 in an in vivo experiment setting, we utilized our "standard screen" for TR agonists:27 the cholesterol fed rat model. In this model the animals confirmed the TR antagonism of 6 by a lowering of the heart rate (-10 ( 2.5% versus vehicle treated animals, p < 0.05) and a possible trend toward an increase of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (+13 ( 13%). This experiment is, however, highly preliminary, and we need to further confirm the antagonism in vivo. We have shown that a potentially druglike high-affinity direct antagonist can be designed from available crystal structures and synthesized in reasonable overall yield. Although substantial additional work on structure-activity relationships (SARs), synthetic procedures, 3D crystal structural work, and in vivo experiments is required to ensure its relevance, this approach represents a promising approach to novel and high-affinity TR antagonists.
