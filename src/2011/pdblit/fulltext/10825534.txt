We developed a microtiter solid-phase radioimmunoassay for quantitating C3 breakdown products (iC3b, C3dg, C3d) in human plasma with a unique monoclonal antibody specific for a neoantigen present on iC3b and C3d (MoAb 130). This monoclonal antibody reacts with a neoantigen which appears when C3b is converted to iC3b. The neoantigen is also present on the C3dg and C3d fragments derived from iC3b. The concentration of the neoantigen is elevated in the plasma of most patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus as compared to normal volunteers. Some patients with glomerulonephritis also had elevated concentration of the neoantigen in their plasma.

Introduction

Activation of both the classical and the alternate pathways of complement converge upon the activation of C3 (Ruddy et al., 1972). The activation of C3 by the classical and/or alternate pathway generates the C3a and C3b, which have many important biological functions (Muller-Eberhard, 1981). C3b is subsequently inactivated by factors H and I and iC3b is thereby produced (Pangburn et al., 1977). Subsequent proteolytic cleavages generate several fragments of iC3b including C3c, C3dg, C3d, C3g, and C3e (Lachmann et al., 1982).

The quantitation of activated C3 fragments called C3d in plasma of patients with various immunologically mediated diseases has been the subject of recent studies (Perrin et al., 1975; Nydegger et al., 1977; Brandslund et al., 1981; Bourke et al., 1982; Mallya et al., 1982; Bhakdi et al., 1984). A 2-step procedure based on the combined use of PEG precipitation followed by radial immunodiffusion (Perrin et al., 1975), electroimmunodiffusion (Bourke et al., 1982), or laser nephelometry (Mallya et al., 1982) has been used for quantitation of C3d in plasma, These PEG precipitation methods have been used in previous investigations. However, these methods suffer from difficulty that the 11% PEG treatment variably precipitates and removes a significant amount of the C3d. In addition, the native C3 is not quantitatively precipitated by this method (Bhakdi et al., 1984). Alternatively, the 'double-decker' rocket immunoelectrophoresis (Brandslund et al., 1981) and its modification (Bhakdi et al., 1984) have been reported, but these methods are not applica-

34 ble for screening large numbers of plasma samples in the routine laboratory Recently, Tamerius and his co-workers produced a murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb 130) which reacts specifically with a neoantigen present on iC3b, C3dg, and C3d, and minimally or not at all with C3, C3b, or C3c (Tamerius et al., 1985). By using this monoclonal antibody (MoAb 130), we developed a simple new method for directly quantitating the neoantigen to iC3b and C3d in plasma without prior PEG treatment. /~l of 1% BSA in PBS at 4°C overnight to block non-specific protein binding sites. The coated BSA blocked plates were then washed with excess 0.1% BSA in PBS and stored at 4°C until use (usually within 1 week). For determination of neoantigen level to iC3b and C3d in normal plasma samples, the samples were diluted 1:10 in 0.1% BSA in PBS. The diluted samples (50 #1) were added in triplicate to C3-coated wells. In addition to the diluted plasma samples, 50/~1 aliquots containing known amounts (7-1000 ng) of purified iC3b (generously provided by Dr. Michael Pangburn, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA) in 0.1% BSA in PBS were added in triplicate to create a standard curve on the same plate. The control sample consisted of 0.1% BSA in PBS and was added in triplicate to the wells. The ~>I-MoAb 130 anti-neoantigen was thawed and diluted 1 : 50 in 0.1% BSA in PBS. Aliquots of 50 /~1 containing approximately 50000 cpm were added to each well and the plate incubated at 4°C overnight. The plate was then washed 6 times with excess 0.1% BSA in PBS. The washed wells were then cut out and the bound 125I determined in a gamma counter. The amounts of neoantigen (iC3b, C3dg, C3d) in plasma samples were determined and expressed as iC3b equivalents by comparison to the standard curve for purified iC3b.

Materials and methods

Monoclonal antibody (MoAb 130)
MoAb 130 was purified from ascites fluid or from cell culture supernatants by protein A (protein A-CL-Sepharose 4B, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, N J) affinity chromatography (Ey et al., 1978). The purified antibody reacts with the neoantigen both found on cells bearing iC3b or C3d, and on purified, soluble iC3b and C3d, but not on C3c. Native C3 and C3b cross-react less than 1% m o l / m o l with MoAb 130 (Tamerius et al., 1985). The antibody was radiolabeled with ~251 by chloramine-T as described to a specific activity of approximately 1.0/~Ci//~g protein (McConahey and Dixon, 1966). The radiolabeled monoclonal antibody was stored at - 2 0 ° C in 20 p~Ci aliquots in buffer consisting of 1% w / v bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4.

Plasma samples
Plasma samples were obtained from patients and normal volunteers (NHP) in the Clinical Research Center of Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation by venipuncture with collection in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-K, Vacutainer Tube, Becton Dickinson, Orangeburg, N J). All samples were processed immediately. The centrifuged plasma samples were aliquoted and stored for up to 5 years at - 7 0 ° C before analysis. The patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fulfilled criteria of American Rheumatism Association (Ropes et al., 1958; Tan et al., 1982). The plasma samples obtained from patients with glomerulonephritis (GN) were collected and provided by Dr. Robert Wyatt of the University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN.

Microtiter solid-phase radioimmunoassay
Microtiter solid-phase radioimmunoassay was performed as previously described (Kurata et al., 1985). Polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates (Falcon no. 3911, Becton Dickinson, Orangeburg, N J) were incubated with 100 t~l of purified old C3 at a concentration of 1.5 t~g/ml in PBS at 4°C overnight to coat the surface with C3, iC3b, and C3d. The C3 had been purified as described (Tack et al., 1976) and stored at - 7 0 ° C for 2 years. After this period it contained approximately 20% iC3b neoantigen (mol/mol). After overnight incubation, the C3-coated plates were washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS and then each well was incubated with 200

The binding of ~25I-labeled monoclonal specific for the neoantigen on iC3b and C3d was reproducibly inhibited by known amounts of purified iC3b (Fig. 1). When N H P samples were incubated with 12~l_MoAb 130, the radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, there was a small amount of inhibition of the binding of the radiolabeled antibody equivalent to 8 - 2 2 / ~ g / m l of the purified iC3b (n = 33, 15.4 + 3.4/~g/ml). Serial normal samples stored at - 7 0 ° C for up to 5 years contained comparable amounts of neoantigen (fresh NHP, n = 8, 14.1 _+ 3.4 /~g/ml, stored NHP, n = 7, 17.4 _+ 2.6. Statistically these differences were of no significance as shown by Students's t-test). The freezing and thawing of N H P up to 3 times produced no increase in iC3b neoantigen (lst, 13.0; 2nd, 14.0; 3rd, 12.4/zg/ml). Eleven measurements in the same samples showed that the intra-assay coefficient variation was 9.2% (17.3 _+ 1.6) and the interassay coefficient variation in 33 determination was 18.7% (12,3 + 2.3). The neoantigen levels to iC3b and C3d in plasma samples obtained from patients with SLE, RA, and GN were significantly elevated as compared to N H P (Fig. 2.) The plasma of the SEE patients contained the largest amounts of neoantigen (68 _+ 56.7 ~g/ml). Forty-one out of 45

Many previous investigations have pointed to C3 as one of, if not the major, critical complement component in understanding the role of complement activation in certain immunologically mediated diseases. Complement activation by either the classical or alternate pathway involves C3, and it is generally accepted that quantitation of C3 a n d / o r its major breakdown products provides a useful parameter that is relevant in evaluating the course and severity of these diseases (Charlesworth et al., 1974; Perrin et al., 1975; Nydegger et al., 1977). Different methods for quantitating the plasma C3 fragments generated by in vivo complement activation (Clarke and Freeman, 1968; Perrin et al., 1975; Brandslund et al,, 1981; Bourke et al., 1982; Bhakdi et al., 1984) have been reported. The disadvantages of these methods relate to their inability to directly measure the activated fragments of C3 in plasma. The immunochemical techniques employed necessitate either prior separation of the C3 fragments from

36 native C3 as in the P E G m e t h o d s or c u m b e r s o m e i m m u n o e l e c t r o p h o r e t i c m e t h o d s that s e p a r a t e the fragments from native C3. In addition, recent studies have shown that m a n y different f r a g m e n t s of activated C3 m a y persist in p l a s m a - - i n c l u d i n g C3b, C3dg, C3g, as well as C3d ( L a c h m a n n et al., 1982). The availability of a m o n o c l o n a l a n t i b o d y which selectively reacts o n l y with antigens expressed on some C3 f r a g m e n t s e l i m i n a t e d the need to sepa r a t e or r e m o v e native C3 from o u r assay, or to devise sophisticated immunoelectrophoresis (Clarke a n d F r e e m a n , 1968; B r a n d s l u n d et al., 1981; Bhakdi et al,, 1984). U s i n g this unusual m o n o c l o n a l a n t i b o d y we d e v e l o p e d simple m i c r o t i t e r s o l i d - p h a s e r a d i o i m m u n o a s s a y for directly q u a n t i t a t i n g C3 f r a g m e n t s in h u m a n plasma. This assay system is readily a p p l i c a b l e to the m e a s u r e m e n t of a large n u m b e r of p l a s m a s a m p l e s and to the routine clinical l a b o r a t o r y . In a d d i t i o n , because this r a d i o i m m u n o a s s a y can detect ng a m o u n t s of n e o a n t i g e n to iC3b a n d C3d, the n e o a n t i g e n levels in other fluids such as c e r e b r o s p i n a l fluid m a y be m e a s u r able. The levels of n e o a n t i g e n in p l a s m a could theoretically represent either iC3b, C3dg, or C 3 d either a l o n g in solution or b o u n d to other p l a s m a p r o teins. Previous studies of iC3b suggest that C3c a n d C3dg are the m a j o r f r a g m e n t s of C3 in p l a s m a ( L a c h m a n n et al., 1982). The large m a j o r i t y of p l a s m a s a m p l e s o b t a i n e d from S L E or R A p a t i e n t s h a d a b n o r m a l l y elevated n e o a n t i g e n levels indicative of s u b s t a n t i a l in vivo C3 activation. T h e elevated level of n e o a n t i g e n was expected in SLE, a d i s o r d e r k n o w n to be associated with significant c o m p l e m e n t activation ( C h a r l e s w o r t h et al., 1974; Perrin et al., 1975). However, the n e o a n t i g e n was also elevated in R A , a d i s o r d e r where p l a s m a c o m p l e m e n t d e t e r m i n a tions are usually n o r m a l ( V a u g h a n et al., 1951; R u d d y et al,, 1979), despite k n o w n h y p e r m e t a b o lism of C3 a n d C4 (Weinstein et al., 1972; K a p l a n et al., 1980). This suggests that the n e o a n t i g e n assay m a y be a much m o r e sensitive a n d useful i n d i c a t o r of c o m p l e m e n t activation than CH50, C3, or C4. O u r p r e l i m i n a r y studies of iC3b a n d C3d n e o a n t i g e n in p l a s m a indicates that this m e a s u r e will be a v a l u a b l e correlate of the severity of renal disease a n d clinical activity in S L E ( N e g o r o et al., 1985). The n a t u r e of the neoantigenic material in the p l a s m a of p a t i e n t s has not yet been elucidated on a m o l e c u l a r level. It m a y represent b o t h free a n d / o r i m m u n e c o m p l e x - b o u n d C3 fragments ( T a m e r i u s et al., 1985).
