The hydroxyl radical footprint of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) bound to the high-af®nity sequence TATAAAAG of the adenovirus 2 major late promoter has been quantitatively compared to a 2 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the complex in aqueous solution at room temperature using the CHARMM23 potential. The nucleotide-by-nucleotide analysis of the TBP-TATA hydroxyl radical footprint correlates with the solventaccessible surface calculated from the dynamics simulation. The results suggest that local reactivity towards OH radicals results from the interplay between the local DNA geometry imposed by TBP binding, and the dynamics of the side-chains contacting the sugar hydrogen atoms. Analysis of the dynamics suggests that, over time, TBP forms stable interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone through multiple contacts to different partners. This mechanism results in an enthalpic advantage to complex formation at a low entropic cost.

Introduction
The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is required by the three nuclear RNA polymerases for the initiation of transcription (Cormack & Struhl, 1992). The C-terminal DNA-binding domain of TBP is highly conserved through evolution (Patikoglou et al., 1999). In genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, TBP binds to a speci®c sequence (a TATA box with consensus sequence TATAWAWN, where W  A or T, and N is any nucleotide) located ca 30 base-pairs upstream of the start site of transcription, thus initiating preinitiation complex assembly (Roeder, 1996). Related metazoan proteins (TBP-related factors or TRFs) exist, whose function and distribution may be tissue-speci®c (Dantonel et al., 1999).

Crystallographic analysis of TBP complexed with a variety of transcriptionally competent TATA box sequences (Juo et al., 1996; Kim & Burley, 1994; Kim et al., 1993; Nikolov et al., 1996; Patikoglou et al., 1999) revealed only small variations in the overall structures of these complexes, leading to the idea that TBP is rather rigid and incapable of responding to the different ¯exibilities that have been characterized for the bound DNA (de Souza & Ornstein, 1998; Flatters et al., 1997; Flatters & Lavery 1998; Pastor et al., 1997a,b, 1999; Pastor & Weinstein, 2000). In contrast, gel analysis (Starr et al., 1995; Bareket-Samish et al., 2000) and, more recently, ¯uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Parkhurst et al., 1999; J. Wu et al., unpublished results) and cyclization analysis of TBP complexed to different TATA sequences (Davis et al., 1999) point to DNA sequence-dependent differences in the complex structures. These structural differences appear to be pertinent to the stability of the complex (Hoopes et al., 1998) and to its ability to assemble a transcriptionally productive pre-initiation complex (Bernues et al., 1996). While some of the crystal structures of TBPDNA complexes contain two complexes per asym# 2000 Academic Press

56 metric unit, allowing for an initial characterization of possible structural variations while binding to the same sequence (see Table 1), direct experimental analysis of the dynamics of a TBP-DNA complex (e.g. by NMR) has not been reported. Human TBP (Juo et al., 1996; Nikolov et al., 1996) and yeast TBP (Geiger et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1993) have been crystallized with two different DNA sequences, while TBP from Arabidopsis thaliana was recently reported in complexes with ten variants of the MLP sequence (Patikoglou et al., 1999), all of which yields information on the adaptability of the TBP when faced with slightly different DNA surfaces. However, the analysis of yeast TBP is complicated by the presence of subunits of TFIIA in the same crystal (Geiger et al., 1996), and the two human TBP complexes were solved at different resolution. The large number of cognate structures deposited in the PDB (Bernstein et al., 1977) provides a valuable source of information regarding the range of possible TBP-TATA structures and the conformational adaptability of the constituent macromolecules. However, the structural similarity observable from comparisons of the crystallographically determined TBP-DNA complexes may well re¯ect a consequence of crystal packing requirements. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which have been used to explore the dynamics of such long-lived associations, should provide pertinent information in the absence of lattice constraints. Miaskiewicz & Ornstein (1996) have reported 0.4 ns long MD simulations of A. thaliana TBP (ATH) with and without bound DNA. These simulations show that the free TBP collapses into a closed conformation in the absence of DNA, and led to the suggestion that this hinge motion is important in DNA binding. These simulations show interactions between the main chain of TBP and the bases outside the TATA box, as well as ¯exibility of some side-chains located within the protein-DNA interface.

MD Interpretation of ÁOH Protection Patterns

Another experimental approach, high-resolution quantitative ÁOH footprinting, has been shown to provide a measure of the solvent accessibility of the sugar protons of DNA and RNA in solution, comparable to that observed in RNA crystal structures and co-crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes (Balasubramanian et al., 1998 Cate et al., 1996; Dixon et al., 1991; Golden et al., 1998). We have examined the ÁOH protection pattern of a TBP-TATA complex in the context of results from MD simulations of such complexes, from which we calculated the time-dependent solvent accessibility of the various sugar H atoms. The results described here show that experimentally determined ÁOH protection data provide tests of the predictions made by the MD simulation and illuminate the mechanisms used by TBP to stably bind speci®c DNA sequences. We show that, in turn, the MD simulations provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms of sugar proton protection from reaction with ÁOH, and provide tools for the interpretation of experimentally determined ÁOH footprints of protein-DNA complexes in a structural and dynamic context.

Results and Discussion
High-resolution ÁOH footprints of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TBP bound to the MLP TATA box are compared to a 2 ns MD simulation of an A. thaliana TBP complex with the same DNA sequence. The MLP TATA sequence selected for these studies is effectively the reference sequence used in both theoretical and experimental studies. In the absence of a crystal structure of S. cerevisiae TBP complexed with MLP, the co-crystal structure of A. thaliana TBP was chosen as the starting point for the simulation. The plant and yeast TBPs are $80 % identical with 100 % conservation of the residues in contact with DNA (Patikoglou et al., 1999) (Table 1).

57 widening of the minor groove. There is a drastic increase in the accessible surface area of the minor groove upon TBP binding, which is compensated for by the exclusion of most of this surface from the solvent via contacts with the side-chains of TBP. H-1H and H-2H point towards the TBP interface, so they have minimal accessibility in the complex. In the TBP-MLP complex, H-3H and H-2HH point towards the major groove away from TBP, but they are almost inaccessible to the solvent due to the curvature in DNA imposed by TBP (Figure 4). In the bound DNA conformation (TA-DNA (Guzikevich-Guerstein & Shakked, 1996)), H-2HH stacks against the base in the 3H direction. H-4H , H-5H and H-5HH are located at the rim of the minor groove, poised at the interface of TBP and solvent. Thus, these protons are likely to be most sensitive to side-chain dynamics. Figure 3 compares the relative sugar reactivities to Á OH and the time-averaged accessible surface area for the same sugars, obtained from the MD simulation (the accessible surface areas for the same DNA sequences in canonical A and B-DNA are shown for reference). The agreement between the patterns of reactivity and accessible surface area is striking, especially in the region of the DNA oligomer that is contacted directly by TBP (from T2 to G9 in the top strand and from C4 to A11 in the bottom strand). These data are consistent with the model proposed by Balasubramanian et al. (1998), that the local ÁOH reactivity is determined primarily by the solvent accessibility of the sugar hydrogens. While there is good overall agreement between the patterns of experimental reactivity and accessibilities derived either from the simulation or from the crystal structure, signi®cant differences are evident.

The ÁOH protection pattern of the TBP-MLP complex Figure 1 shows autoradiograms of the Á OH footprints of the top and bottom DNA strands in the presence and absence of TBP. Figure 2 shows the relative reactivities of the sequences 5H -CGAG CTCGGTACCCGCTATAAAAGGGCAGGGGA-3H and 3H -TGGGCGATATTTTCCCGTCCCCTA-5H as obtained from DNA oligomers 32P-labeled on either the 5H or the 3H end. The same overall pattern of ÁOH protection is observed for the two labeling protocols. For clarity, only the data obtained using the 3H -labeled DNA is shown in subsequent Figures. The accessibilities calculated for the simulated nucleotides are shown in Figure 3 (blue lines). An analysis of the free DNA and the DNA ¯anking the TATA box in the protein-DNA complex will be published elsewhere. It should be noted that identical ÁOH reactivity patterns are obtained when a synchrotron X-ray beam (Sclavi et al., 1997) rather than Fe-EDTA-mediated Fenton chemistry is used to generate ÁOH (B. Gilden & M.B., unpublished results). This result argues for the absence of any interaction of the Fe-EDTA complex with DNA under these experimental conditions. Comparison of experiment, simulation and crystal structures In canonical B-DNA (Arnott & Hukins, 1972) uncomplexed with proteins, the most accessible H atoms of the nucleotide sugars are H-4H and H-5HH . H-1H , H-2H and H-5H are practically inaccessible, and H-2HH and H-3H show very modest accessibility. In A-DNA there is an increase in solvent-accessible surface area compared to B-DNA, due to the

tivity in the top strand. The A-tract 3H to T4 is more reactive, including the aforementioned A8 predicted by the crystal structures to be inaccessible. In contrast, the MD simulation predicts appreciable reactivity for these bases and more faithfully reproduces the ``zig-zag'' pattern of reactivity of the TAAAAG sequence. Similarly, in the bottom strand, bases T7 and T8 have lower reactivity than T5, T6 and T10 in the experimental results, the latter bases predicted by the crystal structures to be inaccessible. While the predicted solvent accessibility differences between simulation and crystal structure are subtle, the simulation does more faithfully re¯ect the relative reactivities of bases T5 and T6, and from T8 through A11.

Molecular mechanisms of the ÁOH protection pattern The local Á OH reactivity depends on the accessibility of the individual sugar hydrogen atoms to solvent. To a ®rst approximation, the solvent accessibility might be accounted for by TBP side-chain contacts, implicating steric hindrance as the main mechanism of ÁOH protection. In Figure 5, the average number of contacts (distances within Ê 2.7 A) between TBP atoms and the sugar hydrogen atoms at each nucleotide within the TATA box is compared to the experimentally determined relative ÁOH reactivity. As expected, the number of contacts and the ÁOH reactivity are anti-correlated. However, the coincidence of the patterns is not suf®cient to provide a robust explanation of the protection pattern. For example, T4 in the top strand has the least reactivity and the highest number of contacts, in both the simulated structures and in the crystal. In contrast, A6 in the same strand has only slightly higher reactivity but many fewer contacts. Analogously, A9 and T7 in the bottom strand have roughly the same number of contacts but very different ÁOH reactivities. Lastly, the pattern of contacts derived from the crystal suggests symmetric sugar contacts along the TBP-MLP interface. However, the experimental ÁOH protection pattern suggests more intimate contact at the consensus half of the TATA box, especially for the top strand. The observed asymmetry is re¯ected in the MD simulation. A variety of mechanisms by which Á OH reactivity could be modulated were explored with the MD simulation. Another potential source for steric hindrance was identi®ed in the ambient sodium ions that are included in the simulation. However, when their contribution was evaluated from a count of the number of contacts of sodium ions to the sugar hydrogen atoms, the resulting small number was consistent with only a negligible contribution to the decrease in solvent accessibility. Since ÁOH is electrically neutral, the local electrostatic environment of each sugar is not likely to play any role in the differential reactivities.

The calculated solvent accessibilities diminish to essentially zero at A8 in the top strand and T5, T6 and T10 in the bottom strand for all of the crystal structures of TBP-DNA binary complexes reported to date (PDT025 (Kim & Burley, 1994), 1YTB (Kim et al. 1993), 1CDW (Nikolov et al., 1996), 1TGH (Juo et al., 1996) and the 1QN* series (Patikoglou et al., 1999)) (data not shown). Since negligible solvent accessibility in a structure predicts an absence of detectable ÁOH reactivity above background, the crystal structures predict an absence of reactivity in the aforementioned positions in the structure. While ÁOH protection data do not provide an absolute measure of reactivity, inspection of the relative reactivities reveals inconsistencies with the predictions of the crystal structures. These inconsistencies are partially relieved in the reactivity pattern predicted from the dynamic picture of the complex re¯ected in the MD simulation. For example, position T4 in the consensus half-site of the TATA-box sequence displays the lowest reac-

Local variations in the sugar conformation might modulate the accessibility to the solvent. The backbone conformation of DNA bound by TBP is very similar to that of A-DNA, with the sugar puckers in the North range (GuzikevichGuerstein & Shakked, 1996). Only the backbone dihedral angle b shows variability related to the Á OH protection pattern. The rotation about this bond moves H-5HH out towards the solvent, increasing the reactivity at that nucleotide. Figure 6 compares the reactivity and the average value for b at each position of the TATA box. The highest reactivities are found for b values around 150  . The conformation of the sugar is apparently affected by pressure from the neigh-

boring TBP side-chains. For example, at A7 in the top strand, Thr13 places a hydrogen atom directly over the center of the sugar, while Gln98 makes contacts between its Cd and H-5H , as seen in Figure 7(a). The symmetry-related residue Gln8 is responsible for the sugar conformation at A9 in the bottom strand, and a combination of contacts between Phe56 and Lys60 keep A8 of the top strand in place. To illustrate the manner in which the dynamic superposition of the general effects described above determines the experimentally observed nucleotide-speci®c differences in solvent accessibility, we discuss below four locations in the complex:

T4 has the most protected sugar residue in the top strand The sugar moiety at T4 has an almost canonical b dihedral angle value and the largest number of contacts in the whole complex. Arg136 makes H-bonds to both the phosphate anionic oxygen atom and to the one on the phosphodiester link, covering H-4H , H-5H and H-5HH (Figure 7(b)). These H-bonds are remarkably stable throughout the simulation, and must be stable in solution, given the low reactivity at this site (Figure 2). One possible reason for this stability is the environment surrounding Arg136; it is embedded in a region of positive electrostatic potential, generated by the neighboring Lys141 and Lys138. This interaction is not easily disrupted by water, since Arg136 is engaged in two H-bonds to the phosphate group. The most reactive nucleotide in the bottom strand is A9 This represents a striking increase in reactivity in an otherwise almost featureless footprint (compared to the top strand). As mentioned above, this residue has a low b value, both in the crystal structures and in the simulation. Its structure is shown in Figure 7(c). Gln8 forms a H-bond with Ser103, creating a protecting cover for the sugar, but-

tressed by Val153. The contacts between various atoms of Gln8 and the sugar moiety appear to be responsible for the abnormal b value and the increased exposure of H-5HH . The contacts with Val153 achieve the same result for H-2HH . Consequently, the increase in ÁOH reactivity is likely due to an abnormal sugar conformation and the absence of a long side-chain interacting with the phosphate group. A8 in the top strand is predicted by the crystal structures to be inaccessible to solvent The simulation and the experimental ÁOH reactivity suggest otherwise. Lys60 forms a H-bond to the phosphate group of A8, completely covering the sugar hydrogen atoms (Figure 8(a)). The average structure from the simulation shows Lys60 in a slightly different conformation, but still covering the sugar hydrogen atoms (Figure 8(b)). However, the reason for the observable ÁOH reactivity and accessibility of this sugar moiety is that Lys60 is not always bound to the phosphate group, as manifested in the multiple rotamers explored by this side-chain during the simulation. This is evident in the histograms in Figure 9, with two rotamers populated for w2 and w3, and the three allowed rotamers for w4. Thus, reactivity is due to the dynamic effect of the time-dependent behavior of

the Lys60 side-chain. Unlike Arg136 discussed above, Lys60 moves among favorable interacting sites in its vicinity: the phosphate groups in A8 and G9, and the carboxylate group of Asp94. The Lys60-phosphate interaction is more easily disrupted by water, because it involves only one Hbond at a time. The crystal structures predict that T5 and T6 in the bottom strand are almost completely solvent-inaccessible Similarly, the simulation predicts very low reactivity, especially for T6. Close examination of this region of the complex uncovered an intricate net-

work of constantly exchanging H-bonds between Arg38, Arg45, Glu33 and the phosphate groups of these nucleotides (Figure 10). Arg45 is almost always bound to the phosphate group of T7 at least with a single H-bond, and this results in the shielding of the sugar moiety of T6, accounting for the low reactivity at this site. On the other hand, Arg38 ¯uctuates widely, leaving the sugar moiety of T5 less protected and hence more susceptible to attack by ÁOH. Once more, these ¯uctuations re¯ect the availability of a variety of equally attractive interactions nearby, and illustrate the role of local dynamics in determining the relative ÁOH reactivities.

Conclusions
MD simulation has been used to interpret the ®ne structure of quantitative ÁOH reactivity pro®les of a protein-DNA complex. These studies of the TBP-DNA interaction are, to our knowledge, the ®rst application of MD simulation to the interpretation of such footprint data. The dynamics approach to analyzing sequence-speci®c proteinDNA described here is likely to be applicable to other systems in which crystallographic and solution-derived structural data exist. Hydroxyl radical ``footprinting'' makes parsimonious use of biological materials, can be conducted quickly and inexpensively, yet yields detailed information

about the nucleic acid conformation within a complex. Thus, the approach illustrated here may be particularly valuable in exploring the structures of protein-DNA complexes over ranges of experimental conditions and/or their time evolution. The analysis of an MD simulation of the TBPMLP complex shows that the experimentally observed Á OH reactivity pattern is due to both TBP-induced DNA deformation (in particular, to variations in the dihedral angle b) and the presence or absence of DNA contacts with TBP side-chains. The studies highlight the lack of symmetry in the contacts between TBP and each of the two strands of DNA, and identify a polarity in the interaction, especially for the top strand. As the various contri-

MD Interpretation of ÁOH Protection Patterns

63 by the simulation accurately re¯ects the dynamics that are responsible for some of the characteristics of the reactivity pattern (for example, at A8 in the top strand and T7 in the bottom strand). That the pattern of contacts predicted by the simulation is within the range of contacts observed in the crystal structures supports the accuracy of the simulation methodology. Notably, the MD simulation results suggest that a variety of mechanisms dominate the stability of TBP-DNA interactions at different points along the TBP-DNA interface. Thus, in an aqueous interface, direct H-bonds are subject to competition by the excess solvent. Two different strategies to obtain stability in spite of this competition are evident in our results. First, some interactions appear to have evolved to occur in a local environment that provides few binding alternatives for the involved residues. This restriction of alternative interactions forces the population of direct H-bonds between positive side-chains and the phosphate moieties. An example was illustrated above for Arg136. Second, because enthalpic stabilization comes at an entropic cost, an alternative scenario occurs for Lys60 and Arg38, which engage in enthalpically favorable but promiscuous interactions. Hence, in this case, a signi®cant portion of the entropic penalty for complex formation is regained by switching between nearby ligands. This variety of interaction mechanisms is observable as well from the analysis of variability in contact numbers among different crystal structures of TBP-DNA binary complexes, which suggests that TBP has the ability to respond to differences in sequence by modifying the nature of interactions in a local fashion.

As the asymmetric unit contains two copies of the complex, the complex with smaller B-factors (complex 2) was used. The three internal water molecules observed in the structure were included (Kim & Burley, 1994). Residues Ser19 to Ile199 constitute the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of A. thaliana TBP. Here, residue numbers are assigned starting at Ser1 (to recover the original numbers, add 18). The DNA double-stranded oligomer was truncated to the dodecamer sequence (CTATAAAAGGGC), numbered from 1 to 12 on each strand, 5H to 3H . The sequence of the top strand is shown. The 5H -terminal phosphate groups were substituted by OH, and 22 sodium ions Ê added at 3.5 A from the phosphorus atom along the O1P-P-O2P bisector. The complex with the sodium ions was solvated with 6162 TIP3 water molecules, and ®t (Mezei, 1997) into a hexagonal prism simulation cell Ê Ê (64 A long Â 36 A side), yielding a density of 1.04 g/cm3. The simulation was run with the CHARMM23 version and potential (MacKerell et al., 1995) of the CHARMM Ê program (Brooks et al., 1983), with a 13 A cutoff, SHIFT Ê for the electrostatic potential at 12 A, and SWITCH for the van der Waals potential. Neighbor lists were updated every ten steps, and the dynamics was propa-

gated with the Verlet algorithm. SHAKE (Ryckaert et al., 1977) was used on all bonds to a hydrogen atom. The water and sodium ions were energy minimized with 250 steps of steepest descent and 250 steps of adopted basis-Newton Raphson. The water and sodium ions were then heated to 600 K during 10 ps with velocity reassignment, and equilibrated for 150 ps at 600 K with a time-step of 2 fs. The last structure produced by the equilibration was energy minimized with the same protocol as before. The whole system was slowly heated over 10 ps to 300 K with velocity reassignment, and equilibrated at this temperature for 30 ps with velocity rescaling if the temperature ¯uctuated more than 3 K, with a time-step of 2 fs. After this point, the time-step was reduced to 1.5 fs and the simulation was run in the NVE ensemble for a total of 2.04 ns. The complex drifted from the starting structure during $750 ps, achieving ®nally an average root-mean-square distance (r.m.s.d.) to the starting crystal structure of Ê 2.1 A over all heavy atoms. A 2D r.m.s.d. plot of the structures generated during the simulation shows the oscillation around an extended energy basin from $350 ps of simulation onwards; the 2D r.m.s.d. analysis restricted to the contributions from TBP and the eight base-pairs of the TATA box showed a behavior consistent with the oscillation in a wide energy minimum throughout the production phase (data not shown), justi-

fying the use of the whole trajectory in the analysis. Hence, an average structure was calculated from all the structures. Analysis of the simulation Atom-atom contacts were calculated inside CHARMM25. A contact to a sugar hydrogen atom was counted if the distance between any TBP atom and a Ê sugar hydrogen atom was <2.7 A. This cutoff was derived from the sum of the van der Waals radii of the sugar hydrogen atoms and the largest radius found in the CHARMM23 parameter ®le. Thus, it represents an upper bound to a van der Waals contact geometry. For comparison with Á OH footprinting data, the solvent accessibility was calculated according to the Lee & Richards (1971) analytical algorithm implemented in Ê CHARMM25; a solvent radius of 1.4 A and the standard van der Waals radius in CHARMM23 were used. The contributions from each hydrogen atom of the sugar moieties were added, and then averaged as a function of time on a per residue basis. The simulation was divided into ten intervals of 204 ps, and the averages were calculated for each time-interval. The averages of these time averages and the standard error of the mean are reported together. The contributions from the ®rst and last nucleotides of the strands of DNA were not considered in the analysis, as they represent end effects not present in the experimental setup. Dihedral angle calculations for TBP and DNA were done with the Curves (Lavery & Sklenar, 1988) and Procurves (Sklenar et al., 1989) modules implemented in Dials and Windows (Ravishanker et al., 1989).

Experiment DNA and protein preparation Full-length TBP from S. cerevisiae was expressed in Escherichia coli and puri®ed as described (Parkhurst et al., 1996; Petri et al., 1995) and is fully active in DNA binding (Daugherty et al., 2000; Parkhurst et al., 1999; Petri et al., 1998). Plasmid ppUMLP is an oligonucleotide containing the adenovirus 2 major late promoter (MLP) TATA box and adjacent sequences (5H -GCTATAAAAGGGCA-3H ) inserted in pUC19 (Patikoglou et al., 1999). Restriction fragments labeled with 32P at either the 3H or 5H ends were prepared as follows. Plasmid ppUMLP was restricted with HindIII. For top strand 3H analysis, a single [a-32P]dATP molecule was incorporated by the large DNA polymerase fragment (Klenow). Secondary digestion with NdeI and puri®cation according to published protocols (Senear et al., 1993) yields a 282 bp restriction fragment labeled at one end with the ®rst nucleotide of the TATA box situated 38 bp from the labeled 3H end of the DNA. For bottom strand 5H analysis, the HindIII restriction site was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase and kinased with [a-32P]ATP using phage T4 polynucleotide kinase. Secondary restriction with NdeI and puri®cation as described above yields the 282 bp fragment with the ®rst nucleotide of the TATA box situated 41 bp from the labeled 5' end of the DNA. The remaining two radiolabeled restriction fragments were generated by restriction of ppUMLP with EcoRI. For bottom strand 3H analysis, [a-32P]ddATP (Amersham1, PB10233), was incorporated with Klenow.

Secondary digestion with HindIII and puri®cation as described above yields a 65 bp restriction fragment with the ®rst nucleotide of the TATA box situated 17 bp from the 32P labeled 3H end of this DNA. For top strand 5H analysis, the EcoRI restriction site was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase and kinased with [g-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Secondary restriction with HindIII as described above yields the 65 bp restriction fragment with the TATA box situated 20 bp from the labeled 5H end of the DNA. Hydroxyl radical ``footprinting'' and analysis Hydroxyl radical protection (``footprinting'') experiments were conducted using Fe-EDTA-mediated Fenton chemistry as described (Shafer et al., 1989; Strahs & Brenowitz, 1994). The binding of S. cerevisiae TBP to DNA was carried out in an assay buffer of 10 mM sodium cacodylate, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.01 % (w/v) Brij58, 100 mM KCl, 1 mg/ml poly(dG/dC), at pH 7.0 and 25  C. The protein stock solutions were dialyzed in the assay buffer overnight at 4  C prior to ÁOH footprinting. Control experiments show no loss of DNA binding activity by TBP following this procedure (unpublished data). Suf®cient [32P]DNA was diluted in assay buffer to $20,000 dpm per 100 ml total reaction volume. TBP was added to DNA-containing buffer to saturating as determined by TBP titration experiments (data not shown). The TBP and [32P]DNA were incubated at the indicated temperature for at least 15 minutes. Hydroxyl radical cleavage was carried out for two minutes for the top strand and one minute for the bottom strand. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis using denaturing 10 % and 15 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gels for the top and bottom strand DNA molecules, respectively. The gels were dried and visualized by phosphor storage autoradiography using a Molecular Dynamics1 PhosphorImager1. A band-by-band ®tting procedure based upon published protocols (Shadle et al., 1997; Strahs & Brenowitz, 1994) was implemented on a Windows1 NT workstation to determine the relative ef®ciencies of Á OH nucleotide cleavage. ImageQuant1 (Molecular Dynamics1) was used to generate lane pro®les along the middle of the bands commencing at the trough preceding the fastestmigrating band of interest and continuing through the trough following the slowest-migrating band of interest. (The Polyline function was used to generate pro®les for lanes in which geometric distortion existed.) The width of the pro®le was adjusted to encompass the central 50 % of the band (Figure 1). Invoking the Create Graph function yielded the average line pro®les for the de®ned region. The graph data were exported to an Excel1 (Microsoft1) spreadsheet and the data transformed into the X  line pixel, Y  density and Z  lane format suitable for analysis in Origin1 v 5.0 (MicroCal1, Northhampton, MA). The peak-®tting module of Origin1 was used to ®t a series of Lorentzian line-shapes to each of the line pro®les. Initial guesses for the peak number, positions and heights were entered graphically using the options available within the software. The data sets were truncated as required to begin and end at the base of the trough between bands. A ``constant baseline'' was maintained while ®tting that was in turn held constant for each set of lane pro®les analyzed. Iterations were conducted until the w2 value remained constant and the simulated and

MD Interpretation of ÁOH Protection Patterns experimental curves were visually congruent. Each family of ®tted curves was visually inspected for consistency in the peak heights and widths. The area of the ®tted peaks was normalized to the sum of the area of all the peaks and expressed as a percentage of the total. The mean and standard deviation of three or four independent determinations are reported.
