ABSTRACT:
Single crystal structures of host-guest peptides, (Pro-HypGly)4-Leu-Hyp-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)5 (LOG1) and (ProHyp-Gly)4- (Leu-Hyp-Gly)2-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4 (LOG2), ° ° have been determined at 1.6 A and 1.4 A resolution, respectively. In these crystals, the side chain conformations of the Leu residues were (+)gauche-trans. This conformational preference for the Leu side chain in the Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence was explained by stereochemical considerations together with statistical analysis of Protein Data Bank data. In the (+)gauchetrans conformation, the Leu side chain can protrude along the radial direction of the rod-like triple-helical molecule. One strong hydrophobic interaction of the Leu residue was observed between adjacent molecules in the LOG2 crystal. Because the Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence is one of the most frequently occurring triplets in Type I collagen, this strong hydrophobic interaction can be expected in a fibrillar structure of native collagen. All the

Leu residues in the asymmetric unit of the LOG1 and LOG2 crystals had water molecules hydrogen bonded to their NH. These water molecules made three additional hydrogen bonds with the Hyp OH, the Gly O¼ and a ¼C, water molecule in the second hydration shell, forming a tetrahedral coordination of hydrogen bonds, which allows a smaller mean-square displacement factor of this water oxygen atom than those of other water molecules. These hydrogen bonds stabilize the molecular and packing structures by forming one O¼ ¼C(Gly)---W---OH(Hyp) intra-molecular linkage and two NH(Leu)---W--O¼ ¼C(Gly) and NH(Leu)---W---OH(Hyp) intermolecular linkages. # 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

he molecular structure of collagen has long been a subject of interest; it has now been more than 50 years since Ramachandran and Kartha proposed a triple-helical structure.1 This triple-helical structure can be represented by a left-handed 10/3-helix with a ° 28.6 A axial repeat by modeling the three peptide strands as a

single helix. Rich and Crick also proposed a triple-helical structure with exactly the same helical symmetry and axial repeat, but a different hydrogen bonding scheme.2 They later reported the detailed structure of this model,3 which today is accepted as the molecular structure of collagen. On the other hand, we performed single crystal analysis of a collagen model peptide, (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and obtained a 7/2-helical ° structure with a 20 A axial repeat.4 Because this model can qualitatively explain the fiber diffraction patterns of native collagen, we proposed it as a new structural model for collagen.5 Despite our proposal, this model has been regarded as a structure for model peptides, but not for native collagen over the last three decades. This situation has continued even after recent findings from single crystal structure analyses of model peptides showing clear 7/2-helical symmetry as an average molecular conformation.6 Our recent fiber diffraction analysis of native collagen has demonstrated that both the 10/3-helical model and the 7/2-helical model can quantitatively explain the X-ray fiber diffraction data. In this analysis, both models were refined using continuous intensity data from the same diffraction pattern.7 Furthermore, the histogram of helical twists of 2163 triplets observed in single crystals of collagen model peptides showed that the center of the distribution of helical twist (52.68) is very close to the helical twist (51.48) of the ideal 7/2-helical model.8 In contrast, there is no indication for the Rich and Crick model around 368, which is the helical twist of the ideal 10/3-helix.8 These recent findings from both native collagen and model peptides indicate that the average molecular structure of native collagen is not the prevailing Rich and Crick model (10/3-helix), but our 7/2-helical model. The helical symmetry of the rod-like collagen molecule is important, as it changes the surface amino acid distribution; this affects the molecular interactions necessary for selfassembly of collagen microfibrils. Type I and II collagens form a microfibril in which each molecule is staggered axially ° by about 670 A (¼ D) from the neighboring molecules. Since the molecular length of collagen is about 4.4 D, this D-stagger produces an axial repetition of the gap (0.6 D) and overlap (0.4 D) step function of electron density,9 which was observed as a characteristic banding pattern in electron micrographs and as a series of meridional reflections in the small angle X-ray diffraction. To ensure the D-staggered structure there should be a sophisticated mechanism by inter-molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. According to the Fourier analysis of hydrophobic residues in the a1(I) sequence, there is an unusual concentration of hydrophobic residues with the 21-residue separation.10 In the 7/2helical model, the number of residues in one helical turn of

each strand is 21. Therefore, the result of Fourier analysis suggests that hydrophobic amino acid residues localize on the special section of rod-like collagen along the molecular axis, which imply the importance of hydrophobic interaction in the formation of microfibrils. In the collagen triple-helix, amino acid residues in the X and Y positions of the Gly-X-Y triplet are exposed to solvent water molecules. Therefore, it is important to accumulate structural information regarding surface hydrophobic side chains to consider hydrophobic interactions for the molecular assembly. The hydrophobic amino acids Leu and Phe occur much more frequently in the X rather than the Y position11 and the Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence is one of the most frequently appearing triplets in collagen.12 In this study, we have designed host-guest peptides, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-LeuHyp-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)5 (hereafter, LOG1) and (Pro-HypGly)4-(Leu-Hyp-Gly)2-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4 (hereafter, LOG2) to understand the conformational features of Leu residues in a triple helical structure by means of X-ray single crystal analysis.

METHODS
Peptide Synthesis
The LOG1 peptide was synthesized by the solid-phase method with tert-butyloxy-carbonyl (Boc) chemistry starting with Boc-Gly-PAM resin (1.0 g, 0.13 mmol/g).13 After treatment with 25% trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane for 30 min to remove the Boc group, chain elongation was carried out by condensations of Boc-GlyPro-Hyp(Bzl) (5 times), Boc-Hyp(Bzl), Boc-Leu, Boc-Gly, Boc-GlyPro-Hyp(Bzl) (3 times), Boc-Hyp(Bzl), and Boc-Pro to build a protected 30 residue peptide corresponding to LOG1 on the resin. For each condensation, 2.0 equiv of the building block, 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexa-fluorophosphate (2.0 equiv), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (2.0 equiv), and diisopropylethylamine (3.0 equiv) were reacted in DMF at room temperature for 10 min to perform preactivation. Removal of the Boc group was performed with 25% trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane after each coupling step. The protected 30 residue peptideresin was then treated with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (10 mL) on ice for 90 min to release the 30 residue peptide from the resin and to remove the benzyl group. The crude product was extracted with 10% acetic acid and lyophilized to afford 113 mg of white powder, which was further purified by Sephadex G-50 (1.8 3 80 cm, 40% acetic acid). The fractions containing pure LOG1 were collected, concentrated, and lyophilized (57 mg). A portion of the pure LOG1 was analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass (FABMS) spectroscopy. The LOG2 peptide was synthesized starting with Boc-Gly-PAM resin (2.0 g, 0.13 mmol/g) in the manner described earlier. The following Boc-peptides and Boc-amino acids were used to build the 30 residue peptide on the resin: Boc-Gly-Pro-Hyp(Bzl) (4 times), Boc-Hyp(Bzl), Boc-Leu, Boc-Gly, Boc-Hyp(Bzl), Boc-Leu, Boc-Gly, Boc-Gly-Pro-Hyp(Bzl) (3 times), Boc-Hyp(Bzl), and Boc-Pro. The

crude LOG2 peptide (621 mg) was obtained by the same procedure used for LOG1 and purified by Sephadex G-50. The fractions containing pure LOG2 were collected, concentrated, and lyophilized (315 mg). The specimen was analyzed by FAB-MS.

Crystallization and Data Collection
Six microliter drops containing 5.0 mg/mL LOG1 peptide solution, 12.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, 0.05M acetate buffer (pH 4.6 at 208C), and 5.0% (v/v) EtOH were equilibrated at 48C against a reservoir containing 30.0% (w/v) PEG400, 0.1M acetate buffer (pH 4.6 at 208C), and 10.0% (v/v) EtOH. Six microliter drops containing 5.0 mg/mL LOG2 peptide solution, 13.5% (w/v) PEG2000, and 0.05M citrate buffer (pH 6.0 at 208C) were equilibrated at 48C against a reservoir containing 27.0% (w/v) PEG2000, and 0.1M citrate buffer (pH 6.0 at 208C). LOG1 crystals were obtained after three months using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method, while LOG2 crystals were obtained after one week using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Both types of crystal had plate-like shapes with dimensions of about 0.5 mm 3 0.1 mm 3 0.05 mm. LOG1 crystals were transferred into cryoprotectant solution containing 25.0% (w/v) PEG400 and 15.0% (w/v) 2-methylpentane-2,-4,-diol (MPD), while LOG2 crystals were transferred into that containing 27.0% (w/v) PEG2000 and 15.0% (w/v) MPD. Data collection and crystallographic data are summarized in Table I. The diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK.14

Structure Determination and Refinement
° Judging from the molecular volume (&15,000 A3) in a related colla° gen model peptide,15 the cell volumes of LOG1 (29,430 A3) and ° 3) suggested two molecules in a unit cell, hence one LOG2 (30,008 A triple-helical molecule in an asymmetric unit of space group P21. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement using the X-PLOR16 program and [(Pro-Hyp-Gly)8]3, which was generated ° from the [(Pro-Hyp-Gly)11]3 structure at 1.26 A resolution, as a probe.17 Molecular orientation and position were clearly identified in the cross-rotation function and subsequent translation function by using 1173 reflections with Fo > r(Fo) for the LOG1 crystal and 1188 reflections with Fo > 2r(Fo) for the LOG2 crystal in the 10.0­ ° 3.0 A resolution range. Structural refinements were carried out using SHELX-L18 by gradually adding reflection data in the higher ° resolution. When the reflection data were expanded to 1.8 A resolution, water molecules were introduced manually based on the Fo­Fc electron density map, hydrogen bonding geometry, and distance from other water oxygen atoms. At the last stage of LOG1 analysis, 7020 (10,991 for LOG2) reflections with Fo > r(Fo) were used in the refinement, of which 6667 (10,254 for LOG2) reflections were used for refinement and 353 (657 for LOG2) reflections for Rfree monitoring. Bond length and bond angle constraints were applied as necessary in the refinements, but no torsion angle restraints were applied. The positions of the Leu residues were identified by looking for negative peaks at the Cd atoms of Pro residues in the Fo­Fc electron density map using XtalView.19 Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with entry codes 2DRT and 2DRX for LOG1 and LOG2, respectively.

FIGURE 1 Stereoview of the triple helical structures. (a) LOG1 and (b) LOG2 molecules.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Molecular Conformation
The molecular conformations of LOG1 and LOG2 are shown in Figure 1. Four residues of LOG1, Pro101, Pro201, Hyp329, and Gly330, and three residues of LOG2, Hyp129, Gly130, and Pro201 are not included in these structures because of their poor electron density. The structural units of the LOG1 and LOG2 molcules consist of three peptide strands reinforced by consecutive hydrogen bonds between the NH of Gly in one strand and the carbonyl oxygens of Pro and Leu in the adjacent strand. These direct hydrogen bonds are illustrated by broken green lines in Figure 2. The average N(Gly)---O(X) bond length and N(Gly)À ÀH---O(X) bond ° ° angle were 2.89 A and 166.08 for LOG1, and 2.91 A and 155.48 for LOG2. This type of direct hydrogen bond between adjacent chains has been reported in molecular models of collagen3,7 and many single crystals of model peptides.15,17,20­29 In addition to NH of the Gly residue, LOG1 and LOG2 peptides have NH of the Leu residue available for hydrogen bond. Although all nine NH groups of Leu do not participate in direct hydrogen bond with peptide atoms, they are involved in water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Gly carbonyl oxygen and Hyp hydroxyl oxygen atoms in the adjaBiopolymers DOI 10.1002/bip

cent strand (illustrated by red broken line in Figure 2). Details of this hydration network will be discussed later on. The overall average torsion angles (/, w, and x) of the LOG1 and LOG2 molcules are listed in Table II, together with those observed in (Pro-Hyp-Gly)1117 and those reported for the two models of native collagen.7,30,31 As the coordinates of the Rich and Crick model3 were refined by the Linked-Atom Least-Squares (LALS) method by Fraser's group,31 we used the latter structure for comparison. No significant differences were observed between the torsion angles of the Leu residue and those of the Pro residue in the X position in the LOG1 and LOG2 peptides. The average values of /, w, and x were very close to those obtained for the (Pro-Hyp-Gly)11 peptide, which has no guest Leu-HypGly sequence.17 The helical parameters (unit height, h, and unit twist, h) for each triplet in each strand were calculated from the bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles by the method of Sugeta and Miyazawa.32 The overall average helical parameters of LOG1 and LOG2 are listed in Table II, together with those for the guest Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence. The overall average helical twists of LOG1 and LOG2 are very close to those of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)11,17 and those of the ideal 7/2-helix (h ¼ 51.48 ¼ 3608/7). However, the average helical twist of the guest region in LOG2 showed a rather small value compared with that of LOG1. Two successive triplets of the Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence seemed to cause the relaxed conformation in this region. This type of relaxation was also observed in the guest region in the Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-GluArg sequence of the IBP peptide20,24 and in the Ile-Thr-GlyAla-Arg-Gly-Leu-Ala-Gly sequence of the T3-785 peptide.22 The helical (unit) twists of each triplet in each strand of the LOG1 and LOG2 peptides are plotted in Figure 3. Different from those observed in the (Pro-Pro-Gly)9 and (Pro-ProGly)10 peptides,8 the cyclical fluctuation of helical twists was not clear in LOG1, but was observable. That is, in the case of LOG1, the values of helical twist around residue number 6­ 8, 13­14, and 20­21 may be regarded as local maxima in the ° cyclic fluctuation with 7 residues (20 A) period. The guest region of LOG1 (shown in yellow on the x axis) belonged to the second peak of this fluctuation. In contrast, no cyclical fluctuation was observed in the LOG2 peptide, and the rather small values of helical twist in the central region resemble those observed in the T3-785 peptide.22

Conformation of Leu Side Chains
The side chain conformations of leucine residues are defined by the v1 (<N-Ca-Cb-Cc) and v2 (<Ca-Cb-Cc-Cd1) dihedral angles. Histograms of these angles (Figure 4) were obtained by statistical analyses carried out on 15,894 Leu residues of

The major percentage of v1 is in the (+)gauche conformation (68.1%), a minor percentage is in the trans conformation (29.6%), and the (À)gauche conformation is very limited (1.2%). The major percentage of v2 is in the trans (66.5%) conformation, a minor percentage is in the (À)gauche conformation (30.9%), and the (+)gauche conformation is very limited (1.1%). On the whole, the Leu side chains adopt one of three plausible structures. Most of the residues (64.0%) adopt a (+)gauche-trans conformation, meaning (+)gauche for v1 and trans for v2. Most of the rest

of the residues (27.2%) adopt a trans-(À)gauche conformation and a small fraction (2.7%) adopt a (+)gauche(À)gauche conformation. In the triple helical structure, the (À)gauche conformation of v1 is very rare, because the Cd atom of the Leu residue in the i-th position has a short contact with the carbonyl oxygen atom in the (i + 1)th residue when v2 is in the (6)gauche conformation, and the distance between the Cd2 atom and the N atom of the same Leu residue is rather short when v2 is in the trans conformation. Particularly in the latter case, when the adjacent residue in the neighboring strand is Hyp

(as in this study), the Cd2 atom makes a short contact with the hydroxyl oxygen atom in Hyp, which makes the (À)gauche-trans conformation unfeasible. When v1 adopts the trans conformation, the Cd atom of the Leu residue in the i-th position has a short contact with the carbonyl oxygen in the (i + 1)th residue when v2 adopts the trans or (+)gauche conformation, while there is no steric barrier when v2 adopts the (À)gauche conformation. Because of this, the trans-(À)gauche conformation is the second most favored for the most of the sequenses. However, when the (i + 1)th residue is Pro or Hyp, there is a short contact between the Cd1 atom of the Leu residue and the Cd atom in the (i + 1)th imino acid residue. Therefore, this conformation is not possible for the Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence. When v1 adopts the (+)gauche conformation, the steric restriction is much smaller. That is, there is no steric barrier when v2 is in the trans conformation, while the distance

between the Cd atom and the N atom in the same Leu residue is rather short when v2 is in the (6)gauche conformation. As a result, the plausible side chain conformations include (+)gauche-trans, trans-(À)gauche, and (+)gauche(À)gauche. According to the statistics, the percentages of these conformations are 64.0, 27.2, and 2.7%, respectively.

FIGURE 3 Helical twists of all triplets in the three strands (shown in red, green, and blue) of LOG1 (above) and LOG2 (below) show fluctuations around 51.48 (shown by dashed-and-dotted lines), which is the helical twist for the ideal 7/2-helical model of collagen. Thick yellow lines on the horizontal axis show a region in which the corresponding triplet contains a Leu residue.

Leu residues frequently occur in the X position rather than the Y position in the X-Y-Gly sequence.11 For example, in the a1 chain of human Type I collagen (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL (http://au.expasy.org/) accession code P02452), the number of Leu residues in a helical region made up of 1014 amino acid residues is 19, and all but one occur in the X position. Furthermore, more than half of these residues (11) appear in the Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence. According to a frequency analysis of 4040 triplets in human collagens,12 the Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence (5.5%) is the most frequently occurring triplet other than Pro-Hyp-Gly. As we saw in the earlier, the Leu side chain in this sequence can adopt only one conformation, (+)gauche-trans, and protrudes radially from the rod-like molecule. Therefore, we can assume that this Leu side chain plays an important role in the molecular interactions during fibril formation by exposing its characteristic hydrophobicity on the surface of the rod-like molecule.

However, as discussed earlier, the second conformation is available only for sequences other than Leu-Hyp-Gly and Leu-Pro-Gly. As will be seen in the section about hydration, typical hydration patterns of the carbonyl and hydroxyl oxygen atoms in the Gly and Hyp residues were observed in many single crystals of model peptides. In the third conformation, (+)gauche-(À)gauche, Cd atoms have short contacts with these water molecules. As the hydration of peptide oxygen atoms on the surface of a triple helix is quite important for the stabilization of molecular structure, it is reasonable to keep these hydration, and hence not to adopt the third conformation. Therefore, in the Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence, the (+)gauche-trans conformation of the Leu side chain is the only available conformation. The LOG1 and LOG2 peptides have three and six independent Leu residues in an asymmetric unit, respectively. The nine values of the v1 and v2 angles for the nine side chains are listed in Table III. Consistent with the above considerations, all nine conformations are (+)gauche-trans, with average values of v1 ¼ À67.98 and v2 ¼ 173.98. In this conformation, the Leu side chains protrude from the triple-helical rod in the radial direction (Figure 1), making it easier to directly interact with the adjacent triple-helices. Other than the LOG1 and LOG2 peptides, there is only one single crystal analysis of a peptide containing Leu residues. That is the T3785 peptide,22 where two of three independent Leu residues in the Leu-Ala-Gly sequence adopt the (+)gauche-trans conformation, while one Leu residue adopts the trans-(À)gauche conformation, in accordance with the conformational population found in the statistical analysis. As discussed earlier, the latter conformation is impossible for the Leu-Hyp-Gly sequence, but there is no such restriction for the Leu-Ala-Gly sequence.

Puckering of the Proline Ring
Proline residues adopt one of two possible conformations with different ring puckering, known as ``down'' (positive v1) and ``up'' (negative v1), in the crystal structures of small molecules. The ``down'' and ``up'' conformations are closely related to the main chain dihedral angles and hence Pro residues in the (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 structure adopt down and up puckering in the X and Y positions, respectively.34 Hyp residues (more precisely, 4(R)Hyp) strongly prefer the up-puckering that is favorable in the Y position.34 After the proposal of the propensity-based hypothesis34 to understand stabilization and destabilization of Hyp in the Y and X positions, respectively, we have taken notice of proline ring puckering in analyses of triple helical structures of model peptides. In this study, we have observed ring-puckering conformations of 25 Pro and 29 Hyp residues in LOG1 and 29 Pro and 29 Hyp residues in LOG2. All 29 Hyp residues in both peptides adopted up-puckering, consistent with the earlier hypothesis. However, 9 Pro residues in LOG1 and 7 Pro residues in LOG2 adopted up-puckering in the X position despite the expected down-puckering. This type of disobedience to the hypothesis was also observed in the structures of (Pro-HypGly)n (n ¼ 10, 11)17 and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-Pro-Gly-(Pro-HypGly)5.35 In (Hyp-Hyp-Gly)1028 and (Gly-Hyp-Hyp)925, Hyp in the X position adopts up-puckering despite the positional preference for the down-conformation. We do not yet have an explanation for the stabilization and destabilization of a triple helical structure by Hyp.

Hydration of the Triple-Helix
In the structure of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n (n ¼ 10, 11), most of the Pro-Hyp-Gly triplets had five water molecules directly linked

by hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly and Hyp, and the hydroxyl oxygen atoms of Hyp.17 In the latter two cases, the oxygen atoms of Hyp usually make two hydrogen bonds to two water molecules and fulfill the expected hydration. In the first case, only one water molecule bonds to the oxygen because the adjacent strand sterically hinders one of the two potential water sites. These water molecules are called first hydration shell water molecules. In the structure of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n (n ¼ 10, 11) at 100 K, 29 of 35 possible sites in the first hydration shell were filled, a ratio of 0.83. In this study, there were 111 first hydration shell water molecules in the LOG1 asymmetric unit and 107 in the LOG2 asymmetric unit. Because the atomic positions of four terminal residues of LOG1 and three residues of LOG2 could not be obtained in this analysis, the maximum numbers of water molecules in the first hydration shells of LOG1 and LOG2 are 130 and 135, respectively. Therefore, the ratios were 0.85 and 0.79 for LOG1 and LOG2, respectively, very similar to those of the (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n cases. In both LOG1 and LOG2 crystals (Figure 2), several regular hydration patterns appear repetitively. One of the prominent patterns of hydration is the intra-chain hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl oxygen of Hyp and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly, two residues prior to Hyp, mediated by one or two water molecules. This type of hydration was named a ``cn water bridge'' in which the subscript ``n'' corresponds to the number of water molecules participated in this bridge.36 The number of the c1 water bridge observed in this study was 4 in LOG1 and 11 in LOG2, while that of the c2 bridge was 15 in LOG1 and 11 in LOG2. The other type of hydration pattern was observed between the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Hyp and the succeeding Gly in the same strand. This type of hydration was named an ``an water bridge''. The number of the a1 water bridge was 0 in LOG1 and 3 in LOG2, while that of the a2 bridge was 14 in LOG1 and 12 in LOG2. In most of the cases, an a2 bridge is fused together with a c2 bridge by sharing one water molecule linked to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly (Figure 2). There are two remarkable features of the hydration structures of LOG1 and LOG2 that were not observed in the (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n (n ¼ 10, 11) structures.17 The first is an inter-chain hydrogen bond involving the nitrogen atom of Leu residues. Amino acid residues in the X position except Pro and Hyp can form a hydrogen bond linkage to a Gly carbonyl oxygen atom in the adjacent chain via a water molecule. This type of water-mediated hydrogen bond was first proposed by Ramachandran and Chandrasekaran37 and was recently observed in the EKG and T3-785 peptides.21,22 In LOG1 and LOG2, there are three and six Leu nitrogen atoms in the asymmetric unit, respectively. All of these form

NH(Leu)---water---O¼ ¼C(Gly) hydrogen bonds between adjacent strands. Furthermore, these water molecules are also involved in hydrogen bonding with a Hyp hydroxyl oxygen atom in the two residues C-terminal side from the Gly in the same chain. As a result, this water molecule mediates both intra- and inter-chain hydrogen bonds, as shown by red broken lines in Figure 2. All nine water molecules except for W2 in LOG2 adopted tetrahedral hydration by forming one more hydrogen bond with a water molecule in the second hydration shell. As an example, the tetrahedral hydration of W5 in the LOG2 crystal is shown in Figure 5. The W5 water molecule is hydrogen-bonded to the NH of Leu113, the OH of Hyp314, the O¼ of Gly312, and water in the second hydra¼C ° tion shell with bond lengths of 2.96, 2.95, 2.77, and 2.51 A, respectively. The W2 water molecule in the LOG2 crystal has no water molecule to fulfill the tetrahedral hydration because two methyl groups of Leu316 in the adjacent molecule are ° located close to this water (W2---Cd1, 3.66 A; W2---Cd2, 4.14 ° ). Except for W2 of LOG1 (0.33 A2), the mean-square dis° A placement factors of these water molecules (average values for W1 and W3 of LOG1 and for W1 to W6 of LOG2 are ° ° 0.19 A2 and 0.16 A2, respectively) are comparable with those for peptide atoms (Table I) and significantly smaller than those of other water molecules found in these crystals (aver° ° age values are 0.31 A2 for LOG1 and 0.36 A2 for LOG2). Therefore, the water molecules with small displacement factors may play important roles in the stabilization of triplehelices through intra- and inter-strand hydrogen bonds. The second feature found in the structures of LOG1 and LOG2 is the second hydration of Gly carbonyl oxygen atoms (Figure 2). Usually, this oxygen atom has only one hydrogen bond to a water molecule because there is a short contact with the adjacent chain for one of the two hydration sites.17 However, in this study, most of the Gly carbonyl oxygen

atoms that had hydrogen bonds to the Leu NH in the adjacent strand via a water molecule also had a second water molecule linked by a hydrogen bond. Of the nine Gly carbonyl oxygen atoms, eight had second hydrations, including two (Gly112 and Gly312 in LOG2) which have rather long ° hydrogen bonds with water molecules (3.43 and 3.36 A, respectively). The one exceptional oxygen atom is that of Gly212 in LOG1. This oxygen atom links to the water molecule (W2), which has the fairly large mean-square displacement factor as shown in the earlier and has a weak hydrogen bond with the NH of Leu313. Second hydration was also reported in the structure of the EKG peptide.21

Packing Arrangements in the LOG1 and LOG2 Crystals
Model peptides having the Pro-Hyp-Gly sequence as a major component usually adopt a pseudo-hexagonal packing in the lateral direction. In the (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n (n ¼ 10, 11) structures,17 one triple helical molecule is surrounded by six other molecules, and the central molecule has direct hydrophobic interactions or direct hydrogen bonds with four of the surrounding molecules (shown by transparent thick blue lines in Figure 6a) but has no direct interactions with the other two molecules. The distances from A to B and D molecules ° are 13­14 A, while the distance between the A and C mole° cules is about 16 A, which makes the arrangement somewhat distorted. In the case of LOG1, the distances between adja° cent molecules are about 14 A because the central molecule has hydrophobic interactions with all six neighbors with the aid of the Leu side chains, which makes this arrangement closer to ideal hexagonal packing (Figure 6b). In the case of LOG2, the number of interactions between A and C is strikingly large compared to the number of interactions between A and B or D, resulting in intermolecular distances in the ° range of 14­16 A (Figure 6c). Although there is one short atomic contact between the Cd atoms of Leu residues in the A and B molecules in the LOG1 crystal, this hydrophobic interaction does not seem to be strong enough to contribute to the stabilization of the system. In the LOG2 crystal, the Cc, Cd1, and Cd2 atoms of Leu216 of the C molecule interact significantly with the Cc, Cd1, and Cd2 atoms of Leu316 of the A molecule (Figure 7). The distance between Cc atoms in the Leu216 and Leu316 ° residues is 3.69 A. In addition, the Cd atoms in both Leu resiBiopolymers DOI 10.1002/bip

dues contribute to a hydrophobic cluster as shown in Figure 7. These hydrophobic interactions of Leu side chains between adjacent triple-helical molecules seem to be an important driving force in the assembly of collagen microfibrils.
