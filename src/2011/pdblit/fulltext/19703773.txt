Abstract--Starting from 3-aza-6,8-dioxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold (BTAa) a virtual library of molecules was generated and screened in silico against the crystal structure of the Human Macrophage Metalloelastase (MMP-12). The molecules obtaining high score were synthesized and the affinity for the catalytic domain of MMP-12 was experimentally proved by NMR experiments. A BTAa scaffold 20 having a N-hydroxyurea group in position 3 and a p-phenylbenzylcarboxy amide in position 7 showed a fair inhibition potency (IC50 = 149 lM) for MMP-12 and some selectivity towards five different MMPs. These results, taken together with the X-ray structure of the adduct between MMP-12, the inhibitor 20 and the acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), suggest that bicyclic scaffold derivatives may be exploited for the design of new selective matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs). ” 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zincdependent, calcium containing, endopeptidases involved in extracellular matrix degradation and, consequently, they play a crucial role in physiological processes such as tissue remodelling and healing of wounds.1 As the upregulation of MMPs is involved in many inflammatory, malignant and degenerative diseases,2 attempts to design and develop inhibitors that may modulate their regulation have become of great interest.3≠5 The main requirement for a small molecule to be an effective metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPI) is the presence of both a functional group capable of chelating the active-site zinc ion and a lipophilic residue able to fit into the S01 pocket.4 Hydroxamic acid is the most popular zinc binding group (ZBG) for MMPIs even if some authors report that it is fast metabolized in vivo6,7 and

it contributes to increase toxicity due to its low metal binding selectivity.8 The inhibitors designed up to date usually bind the active site on the catalytic domain providing nanomolar dissociation constants.3,4 However, several inhibitors exhibit a poor selectivity as a consequence of the high structural similarity among the members of the MMP family.9 Even if the low specificity does not prevent the use in vivo, it raises a lot of side effects and it also limits the dose that may be daily administered.10,11 As a consequence, the search of new potent and selective MMP inhibitors still represents an important pharmaceutical target. Even if the expensive high-throughput screening of small molecule libraries is one of the most popular approaches in pharmaceutical research, alternative strategies, based on docking calculation and rational drug design, may be adopted if the 3D structure of the target is solved.12≠14 A new class of molecular heterocyclic scaffolds (BTAa) based on 3-aza-6,8-dioxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton,15 which can be decorated with a ZBG and a

lipophilic residue, was chosen to design selective MMP12 inhibitors (Fig. 1). The main feature of these scaffolds is their tridimensional bicyclic skeleton generated by combination of sugar and amino acid derivatives. Their synthesis includes only few steps starting from commercially available enantiopure precursors and a stereochemistry control can be accomplished in each step of the synthesis. As dipeptide isosteres, BTAas are compounds with potential biological activity and their use as central core of pharmaceutical targets is convenient as a high number of positions can be functionalized leading to molecular diversity. Limited flexibility can be advantageous to correctly direct the pharmacophore side chains and it is also useful for computational analysis. In addition, as amino acids, they have full compatibility with the conditions required for solid-phase synthesis.15,16 All these properties, together with fair solubility and low molecular weight, were considered in scaffold selection. Diversification of BTAas by easy decoration with different functional groups may generate virtual libraries which may be screened in silico in order to identify new hit compounds for further lead discovery. Even if the binding energy provided by docking programs does not reflect exactly the real binding affinity, its value al-

lows to score the docking results in order to identify a class of potential ligand.17 Moreover, the experimental assessment of the affinity of few selected molecules outlined by docking results gives the chance to correlate binding energies and binding constants improving the prediction reliability. A combined use of virtual screening and experimental determination of the binding affinity suggested that the BTAas may represent a new type of scaffolds to design a new class of MMPIs. 2. Chemistry The synthesis of 3-biphenyl-4-ylmethyl-3-aza-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-7-carboxylic acid methyl ester (pPhBn-BTGOMe) (8) was carried out following a procedure previously reported for similar compounds and is briefly reported below Scheme 1.12 Reductive alkylation of aminoacetal 1 with biphenyl-4carbaldehyde (2) and NaBH4 afforded in good yield the aryl aminoacetal 3 which was subsequently converted into the amide 5 by treatment with (R,R) tartaric anhydride18 4. Crude 5 was treated with thionyl chloride in MeOH affording cyclic acetal 6, which was submitted to the acid-catalyzed cyclization to give 7 in 40% yield over the four steps. Reduction of amide 7 with BH3¡Me2S furnished the corresponding amine 8 in 70% yield (Scheme 1). Basic hydrolysis of 7 and acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of 8 gave, respectively, the free acids 9 and 10 in good yields.

idazole (CDI) and treated with O-benzylhydroxylamine, as a free base, providing the substituted N-hydroxyurea 19 in 60% yield after crystallization.21 Hydrogenolytic cleavage of the benzyl group over 5% Pd/C afforded the desired final compound 20 (Scheme 4). 3. Results and discussion The availability of high-resolution structure of the MMP-12 catalytic domain22,23 provided the possibility to employ a structure-based approach to design and screen a virtual library. A biphenylic moiety and a hydroxamic (or carboxylic) acid were chosen as good substituents24 to be introduced in different position of BTAa and hundreds of structures were so generated and tested in silico for their affinity to the catalytic domain of MMP-12. The hits with the highest score were selected and, among them, compounds 9-12 were synthesized due to their higher feasibility. In this class of molecules the scaffold supports the biphenylic moiety in front of the ZBG. The Autodock binding model predicted a deep insertion of the biphenyl group into the S01 cavity though the coordination geometry of the ZBG appeared not to be optimized. Dissociation constants (KD) of compounds 9≠12 were calculated through 15N≠1H HSQC experiments.25 In addition, compounds 21≠24, already present in our chemical library, were submitted to the same experiments in order to compare the results and support the docking model. Moreover, the inhibitory activity (IC50) of compounds 9≠12 was measured by enzymatic assays.26 The values of KD and IC50 for the tested compounds 9≠12 and 20≠24 are reported in Table 1.

The debenzylated product 15 was readily obtained by mild hydrogenolytic cleavage of the protecting group over 5% Pd/C at 1 atm (Scheme 3).20 A new BTAa scaffold 20 having the N-hydroxyurea group in position 3 and the p-phenylbenzylcarboxy amide in position 7 was then prepared. Due to the high reactivity of ester 16, the biphenyl derivative 17 was easily and quantitatively prepared by stirring the starting material at 60 ∞C with a neat excess of amine.

Since the identification of the amino acids involved in the binding may be crucial to prove a direct interaction with the catalytic site and, consequently, for the optimization of the process, NMR-based strategies were also used to localize the binding site on the target.27 The identification of the binding site was easily performed analyzing the protein resonance chemical shifts in 1 H≠15N HSQC spectra, recorded either in presence or in absence of the ligand.28 The pattern of the shifts was similar for all ligands. Several residues forming the S01 cavity, one or more zinc binding histidines and the neighbouring amino acids are strongly influenced by the presence of this class of molecules. As example, a ribbon representation of MMP-12 is shown in Figure 2. The NHs showing significant chemical shift perturbation upon the addition of compound 12 are highlighted. The affected amino acids nicely define the ligand binding site that is the same for all the designed compounds in agreement with the docking results. Only few differences were found among the

members of this class. In particular, the NH cross-peak of His218 was only weakly shifted by lactams 9 and 11 with respect to compound 12. The analysis of the results summarized in Table 1 suggests that the bicyclic skeleton of BTAa should be compatible with the metalloelastase catalytic domain, but the activity is strongly modulated by the type and position of the substituents. Hydroxamic acids 11, 12 (IC50 = 425 lM, 399 lM, respectively) are more potent than the carboxylic ones 9, 10 (IC50 = 954 lM, 835 lM, respectively). The affinity observed within this series seemed to be highly dependent on the presence of the biphenylic moiety: the replacement of the biphenylmethyl with a benzylic-protecting group resulted in a loss of binding affinity, so compounds 21 and 22 (KD P 10 mM) are almost inactive; and the introduction of the hydroxamic moiety in position 7 did not restore the activity (see compound 23). Otherwise, the presence of the ZBG and the lipophilic residue in vicinal position decreases the binding affinity as demonstrated

by compound 24 for which no detectable interactions were found by NMR. With these results in our hands we decided to focus our efforts on the design of new derivatives with improved affinity. A deeper penetration in the S01 cavity was possible moving the biphenyl group quite far from the scaffold. Due to the high reactivity of the BTAa methyl ester, it was synthetically very easy to introduce the biphenylic moiety in 7 through an amide bond. As a consequence, the best anchoring point for the ZBG resulted in the N-3 giving rise to a N-hydroxyurea (compound 20). The use of this functional group as metal chelator in MMP inhibitors has been previously reported6 and recently validated by a X-ray structure.31 In order to determine the affinity of the N-hydroxyurea moiety, the model compound 15 was tested in silico and synthesized (see Scheme 3). The in silico model suggested that the interaction of 15 with the active site is limited to the catalytic zinc and to the entrance into the S01 subsite. The structure of the adduct shows the same coordination scheme of the hydroxamic acid which is able both to chelate the active-site zinc ion and to provide a hydrogen bond interaction with the enzyme backbone. The protonated oxygen atom (O4) is involved in a strong hydrogen bond with carboxylate Oe2 of Glu219, while the NH shows weaker electrostatic interaction with the Ala181 carbonyl oxygen. To determine the binding affinity for the MMP-12 catalytic domain, we analyzed the alteration of the chemical shifts induced on 2D 1H≠15N HSQC upon the titration with the N-hydroxyurea derivative 15. The fit of the experimental data provided a dissociation constant of 3.4 mM. The binding mode predicted in silico is supported by the pattern of resonance frequencies shifted as a consequence of the interaction. The NH signal corresponding to His218 is strongly affected by millimolar concentration of the ligand (Fig. 3), while only few residues forming the S01 cavity are weakly influenced. Since the metal binding capability of the N-hydroxyurea was confirmed, the new scaffold 20 was synthesized. (see Scheme 4) The 1H≠15N HSQC spectra for 20 showed a pattern of shifts similar to compounds 9≠12 indicating for all these molecules the same binding site (Fig. 4). A different effect on the zinc binding histidine with respect to the N-hydroxyurea prototype is probably present since the shift perturbation involved mainly His222 instead of His218. The fit of Dd as a function of the ligand concentration provided a KD of 154 lM, in good agreement with the IC50 value of 149 lM obtained by the enzymatic assay (Fig. 4). To probe the selectivity towards MMP-12, N-hydroxyurea 20 was also tested by fluorescence enzymatic experiments for the inhibition of collagenases (MMP-1,

MMP-8, MMP-13), matrilysin 1 (MMP-7) and stromelysin 2 (MMP-10) and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. Compound 20 is a fairly selective MMP-12 inhibitor since it possesses limited activity against the other MMPs especially the MMP-1 and MMP-7. These two enzymes differ from other MMP family members since they have a relatively small S01 pocket which presumably cannot accommodate the large biaryl substituent. Although compound 20 exhibits an improved affinity towards MMP-12, nevertheless the micromolar value of KD demonstrates that all the planned interactions are not optimized. The X-ray structure of the MMP12≠20 complex (PDB code: 2HU6) provided a direct inspection on ligand≠protein interactions (Fig. 5A). As correctly predicted by the NMR studies the molecule binds the metalloelastase at the catalytic site, fitting the biaryl moiety into the S01 pocket. The electron density of the inhibitor is well defined because it is held in place by two hydrogen bonds with Pro238 and Leu181 of the enzyme backbone. However, the contribution of the hydroxyurea to the binding is absolutely negligible since it points towards the exterior of the active site and does not interact with the catalytic zinc ion. Noteworthy, the zinc ion is coordinated by the weak inhibitor acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) present, as stabilizer, in the crystallization buffer. This would suggest that the lack of interaction between the hydroxyurea and the catalytic zinc, evidenced in the crystal structure, is due to the competition with the high concentration of AHA. In order to investigate this point, an energy minimization of the ligand was performed after removing AHA from the PDB and blocking the biaryl group in the crystal structure conformation. The AMBER-8 minimized model indicates that the hydroxyurea function could

coordinate the zinc ion, even if the hydrogen bond interactions with the zinc binding site are not well defined as in the case of AHA (Fig. 5B). Therefore, these data suggest that the anchoring point and/or the length of the ZBG are not optimized and further studies have to be carried out in order to design a nanomolar inhibitor. 4. Conclusion New compounds with affinity for the catalytic domain of the MMP-12 were designed using an integrated approach based on virtual screening and on NMR analysis. The molecules are built around a BTAa scaf-

fold functionalized with a biphenyl moiety and with a ZBG. The adducts provided by docking calculation enabled the identification of the catalytic pocket of MMP-12 as the binding site for this class of compounds. The inspection of the residues showing a significant chemical shift perturbation supports this picture, with the lipophilic moiety fitted into S01 cavity and the bicyclic skeleton located outside, in front of the catalytic zinc. Among the synthesized compounds, the scaffold 20 having the N-hydroxyurea group in position 3 and the p-phenylbenzylcarboxy amide in position 7 showed an improved affinity (KD = 154 lM and IC50 149 lM) for MMP-12 and some selectivity towards the other MMPs.

The X-ray structure of the catalytic domain of Human Macrophage Metalloelastase in the presence of hydroxyurea derivative 20 gave more insight into the ligand≠enzyme interaction and appeared as a new starting point for further MMP-12 inhibitors' designing. New fragments may be easily inserted in the bicyclic scaffold to better interact with the enzyme backbone and to selectively accommodate into the binding pocket of MMP-12. Therefore, the synthetic versatility of BTAas, taken together with dissociation constant in micromolar range and fair selectivity, candidate these molecules as new compound guides to develop more potent and selective inhibitors for MMP-12. 5. Methods Docking calculations were performed using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) of the program Autodock 3.032 which, using principles of natural evolution mutations and cross-over, probes the designed molecules on the three-dimensional structure of the target macromolecule. In this work, the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MMP-12 (PDB code: 1RMZ), processed by AutoDockTools, was used as target protein. The three-dimensional structures of the designed ligands, generated by Chem3D Pro program, were minimized by semiempirical calculations and the Gasteiger-Marsili charges33 assigned by the program Babel. In order to include all the active site, a box of ∞ 19.75 ∑ 19.75 ∑ 19.75 A3, centred near the catalytic zinc ∞ and with a grid spacing of 0.275 A, was selected as docking space. A total of 50 runs were performed for each ligand and the results were ranked according to the docking energy. The cDNA, encoding the fragment Gly106-Gly263 (F171D mutant)34 of the macrophage metalloelastase, was cloned into the pET21 vector (Novagen) using NdeI and BamHI as restriction enzymes and then transfected into E. coli strain BL21 Codon Plus cells. Uniform 15Nlabelled protein was expressed by induction with 0.5 mM IPTG at 37 ∞C for 4 h in M9 minimal media containing 15 mM (15NH4)2SO4. The inclusion bodies, containing the protein, were solubilized in a buffered solution with 20 mM Tris≠HCl and 8 M urea at pH 8. The protein was then purified with a size-exclusion chromatography (Pharmacia HiLoad Superdex 75 16/60) in 6 M urea and 50 mM sodium acetate. A second step of purification was performed on cation exchange column Mono-S (Pharmacia) using a linear gradient of NaCl up to 0.5 M. The protein was refolded by using a multi-step dialysis against solution containing 50 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.3 M NaCl and decreasing concentrations of urea (from 4 M up to 2 M). The last two dialyses were performed against solution containing 20 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.3 M NaCl and 200 mM of hydroxamic acid (AHA). The catalytic domains of

MMP-1 (Val101-Pro269), MMP-7 (Tyr100-Lys272), MMP-8 (Met100-Gly262), MMP-10 (Phe99-Gly263, F170N mutant), MMP-13 (Tyr104-Pro269) were expressed, purified and refolded according to the protocol already described for MMP-12, with minor modifications.

H≠15N HSQC experiments, implemented with the sensitivity enhancement scheme,35 were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker DRX 700 operating at proton nominal frequency of 700.21 MHz. The NMR experiments were performed on samples containing 0.1 mM of 15Nenriched MMP-12 in 10 mM Tris≠HCl buffer, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.3 M NaCl and 0.2 M acetohydroxamic acid at pH 7.2.

The compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the hydrolysis of fluorescence-quenched peptide substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Biomol, Inc.). The assays were performed in 50 mM HEPES buffer, containing 10 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Brij35, at pH 7, using 1 nM of proteolytic enzyme (catalytic domains of MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-10, MMP-12, MMP-13) and 1 lM of peptide. The enzyme was incubated at 25 ∞C with increasing concentration of inhibitor and the fluorescence (excitationmax 328 nm; emissionmax 393 nm) was measured for 3 min after the addition of the substrate using a Varian Eclipse fluorimeter. Fitting of rates as a function of inhibitor concentration provided IC50 values (see Table 1). The inhibitor N-isobutyl-N-[4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl]glycyl hydroxamic acid (Biomol, Inc.) was used as control. Crystals of human MMP-12, already containing AHA from the refolding process, grew at 20 ∞C from a 0.1 M Tris≠HCl, 30% PEG 6000, 200 mM AHA, 1.0 M LiCl2 solution at pH 8.0 using the vapour diffusion technique. The final protein concentration was about 10 mg/ml. Soaking procedure was implemented in order to allow the inhibitor binding; 20 was added in the powdered form directly into the drop using a needle and was left incubating for a few days. The data were measured exploiting synchrotron radiation at the beamline ID23-1 (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The dataset was collected at 100 K and the crystal used for data collection was cryo-cooled without any cryo-protectant treat∞ ment. The crystal diffracted up to 1.3 A resolution and ∞ ∞ belongs to space group C2 (a = 51.25 A, b = 60.18 A, ∞ c = 53.97 A, a = c = 90∞, b = 114.59∞) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, a solvent content of about 50% and a mosaicity of 0.7∞. The data were processed in all cases using the program MOSFLM36 and scaled using the program SCALA37 with the TAILS and SECONDARY corrections on (the latter restrained with a TIE SURFACE command) to achieve an empirical absorption correction. Table 3 shows the data collection and processing statistics for all datasets. The structure was solved using the molecular replacement technique; the model used was that of the MMP-12≠AHA adduct (1Y93) from where the inhibitor, all the water molecules and ions were
