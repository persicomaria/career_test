A novel inhibitor of Schistosoma PNP was identified using an "in silico" approach allied to enzyme inhibition assays. The compound has a monocyclic structure which has not been previously described for PNP inhibitors. The crystallographic structure of the complex was determined and used to elucidate the binding mode within the active site. Furthermore, the predicted pose was very similar to that determined crystallographically, validating the methodology. The compound Sm VS1, despite its low molecular weight, possesses an IC50 of 1.3 M, surprisingly low when compared with purine analogues. This is presumably due to the formation of eight hydrogen bonds with key residues in the active site E203, N245 and T244. The results of this study highlight the importance of the use of multiple conformations for the target during virtual screening. Indeed the Sm VS1 compound was only identified after flipping the N245 side chain. It is expected that the structure will be of use in the development of new highly active non-purine based compounds against the Schistosoma enzyme. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Schistosomiasis is one of the world's most neglected diseases (Hotez et al., 2006) and is the collective name for infection by one of five Schistosoma species (TDR, 2005), of which Schistosoma mansoni is predominant in America and Africa. In 2005 the World Health Organization estimated that 600 million people worldwide were at risk of schistosomiasis, and close to 200 million people are actually infected continuously or intermittently (TDR, 2005). Morbidity due to S. mansoni includes hepatosplenomegaly, liver fibrosis and ascites, and as many as 130,000 individuals die per year from haematemesis due to related portal hypertension (Van Der Werf et al., 2003). The disease is associated with a chronic and debilitating morbidity manifested by its consequences including cognitive impairment, lassitude, and growth stunting (Abdulla et al., 2007). In the absence of a vaccine, efficient vector control and water sanitation, the treatment and control of schistosomiasis rely heavily on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). This drug is active against all schistosome species, and over 25 years of use has established the drug as safe and effective (Caffrey, 2007). The main problem with PZQ is that it is practically inactive against immature schistosomes,

its full activity being displayed only 6­8 weeks after infection (TDR, 2005). Furthermore, treatment failure is often the first indicative of the end of the effective life of a drug (Hagan et al., 2004). In the case of praziquantel several reports of treatment failure or the development of resistant strains of schistosomes have been reported (Silva et al., 2005; Wolfe, 2003; Lawn et al., 2003; Danso-Appiah and De Vlas, 2002; Caffrey, 2007; Fallon and Doenhoff, 1994; Ismail et al., 1994; Doenhoff et al., 2002). Clearly it would be strategically unwise to depend on a single agent for sustainable control of schistosomiasis. Ideally, a range of treatment options should be available, preferably including the use of different drug classes (Hagan et al., 2004). The World Health Organization in their Special Programme For Research and Training in Tropical Diseases reports that several million PZQ doses are administered every year and the number is going to rise in the immediate future, increasing the risk of the development of resistance. It should therefore be apparent that it is now time to start looking for new alternatives for the treatment of schistosomiasis (TDR, 2005). It has been demonstrated that S. mansoni is unable to synthesize purine nucleotides de novo, and that Schistosomes have multiple mechanisms for incorporating preformed purine bases and nucleotides into the purine nucleotide pool (Dovey et al., 1984; Senft and Crabtree, 1977; Senft et al., 1972, 1973). Together with new data from the Schistosoma genome projects for two species (japonicum and mansoni) (Hu et al., 2003; Verjovski-Almeida et al., 2003) this suggests that the purine salvage pathway may be a potential target for novel anti-Schistosomal agents.

Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1) is a central enzyme of this pathway and catalyzes the cleavage of the glycosidic bond in purine ribo and deoxyribonucleosides, in the presence of inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) as a second substrate, generating the corresponding purine base and ribose(deoxyribose) 1-phosphate. In the last two decades there has been considerable interest in new approaches to drug discovery that offer improvements to the process of identifying new therapeutic agents. Technologies such as high-throughput screening (HTS) and combinatorial chemistry allow for the testing of large libraries of compounds against a protein target (Hartshorn et al., 2005). Furthermore, recent advances in drug discovery have enabled a dramatic increase in the number of synthetic molecules and natural products that are available for testing in vitro in biochemical and cellular assays (Mcinnes, 2007). Virtual screening (VS), that is the use of computational tools to identify a reduced number of molecules with increased potential for bioactivity to be evaluated experimentally, has emerged both as a complementary and alternative method to HTS (Alvarez, 2004). The development of virtual screening methods extends the possibilities to studies of molecules that do not necessarily exist physically in an investigator's collection but which can be readily obtained through purchase or synthesis. The other obvious advantage is that, as a result of computational prediction of binding affinity, only a relatively small subset of compounds requires testing and therefore activities can be quantified in low or medium throughput assay format (Mcinnes, 2007). Among the latest developments in drug discovery is a concept called fragment based design, or fragment-based screening (FBS). In contrast to conventional HTS, where fully built, "drug size" chemical compounds are screened for activity, FBS identifies very small chemical sub-structures or fragments (usually 100­250 Da) that may only exhibit weak binding affinity (Jahnke and Daniel, 2006), but which may be more readily identified in a physical chemical (crystallographic) screen rather than a biological one. Here we describe the virtual screening of a small library of low molecular weight compounds using the three-dimensional structure of S. mansoni PNP. Despite the relatively small size of both the library and its component compounds, three completely novel compounds with inhibitor activity were readily identified. One of these compounds has a monocyclic structure of a type never previously described as a PNP inhibitor, and its structure in complex with SmPNP is reported here.

ably with key residues in the active site were selected for activity assays. 2.2. SmPNP activity assays Activity assays for the compounds identified during VS employed the coupled xanthine oxidase method of Kalckar (Kalckar, 1947). This method consists of the measurement of the hypoxanthine released during phosphorolysis of inosine or deoxyinosine indirectly by monitoring the uric acid produced by xanthine oxidase on its oxidation. The reaction mixture (final volume 1 mL) contained 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 L of DMSO (in which the potential inhibitors identified during virtual screening were dissolved at a concentration of 100 M), 100 M inosine and 0.02 units of xanthine oxidase. The reaction was started by addition of 550 ng of SmPNP to the reaction mixture and the OD293 was monitored for 2 min. The active compounds in the assay were subjected to IC50 determination. In this assay an automated method using the BIOMEK3000 workstation was employed. The method used was based on that of Erion et al. (1997), which itself is derived from the method of Kalckar but employs 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride (INT). The addition of INT to the coupled assay resulted in the formation of the highly colored formazan product which absorbs within the range 490­500 nm (Erion et al., 1997). For the IC50 determinations, the assay mixture (200 L) contained 1 mM INT, 20 mU xanthine oxidase, 10 M inosine, 100 mM Tris­HCl buffer pH 7.0 and 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0 and different concentrations of the VS compound. For Sm VS1 the concentrations used were 25.00, 12.50, 6.25, 3.12, 1.60, 0.80 and 0.40 M. The reaction was started with the addition of SmPNP (500 ng) and monitored in the microplate reader at 500 nm for up to 2 min. For calculation of the IC50 value, a nonlinear four-parameter fit was used according to the sigmoidal Imax model using the Sigma Plot Software. 2.3. Crystallization and soaking of SmPNP The purification and crystallization protocols used were as previously described (Pereira et al., 2003, 2005). The soaking parameters for SmPNP crystals consisted of 20% PEG 1500, 10% DMSO (in which the compound was dissolved at a concentration of 5 mM), 15 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.9 or 5.0 (at the pH of crystal growth) and 20% glycerol. This solution is also a cryoprotectant allowing for the rapid freezing of the crystals directly from the soaking solutions. The crystals could be maintained in this solution for 96 h before freezing. 2.4. X-ray data collection X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K to a resolution of 1.9 Å from an SmPNP crystal after soaking with the compound Sm VS1. Measurements were made on Station PX14.2 of the SRS (Daresbury-UK) using = 0.980 Å, over 1 increments in  for a total rotation of 65 . The data were indexed and integrated using the program MOSFLM (Leslie, 1999) and scaled using the program SCALA from the CCP4 suite (1994). 2.5. Structure solution and refinement Crystals of the Sm VS1 complex were isomorphous with other PNP complexes and therefore the structure could be solved by rigid body refinement using SmPNP in complex with acetate (1TD1) as an initial model using the Refmac program (Murshudov et al., 1997). Full refinement was carried out using both Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997) and Phenix (Adams et al., 2002) and the model

2. Materials and methods 2.1. SmPNP virtual screening Using the SmPNP structure in the form of its complex with NDSB-195 and acetate (PDB code 1TCV) (Pereira et al., 2005) a virtual screen was performed in order to identify compounds that may be potential binders. For this purpose the coordinates corresponding to the NSDB-195 and acetate ligands were removed from the structure file and the key residues in the SmPNP active site were identified and assigned for use in the virtual screening. These included all residues which interact directly with one of the ligands: G34, S35, H66, R86, H844, Y90, A118, A119, Y202, E203, M221, S222, T244, N245, S247 and H259. The residue E203 was used in its protonated state and rotamers were considered for N245 in which the N 1 and O 2 atoms were exchanged by flipping 2 . The maximum molecular weight of the compounds used in the search was 280 Da, which are part of a proprietary ASTEX database including 30,000 compounds. The program GOLD (Jones et al., 1997) was used for virtual screening employing the GOLD virtual screening parameters and goldscore as a scoring function. The best scored solutions were inspected manually and 22 compounds that interacted favor-

building performed with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004), using a -weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron density maps. A total of 763 water molecules were included using both COOT and Phenix and the Sm VS1 and a sulphate ion were added using the Find Ligand routine of COOT. In all cases, the behaviour of R and RFree was used as the principal criteria for validating the refinement protocol and its convergence. The stereochemical quality of the model was evaluated with Procheck (Laskowski et al., 1993). The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the PDB under the following code: 3E0Q. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Virtual screening As described previously (Pereira et al., 2007), a database of 30,000 compounds with molecular weight below 280 Da, was used in the virtual screening (VS). Compounds with the highest scores (about 100) were visually inspected and 22 compounds were selected on the basis of their drug-like properties and potential favourable interactions with the key residues of the active site. We only describe here the compounds that demonstrated inhibitory activity against SmPNP. The compound Sm VS1 (6amino-5-bromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-2,4-dione) shown in Fig. 1, has a monocyclic structure and its preferred pose forms six hydrogen bonds with residues of the active site, all within the base binding pocket. Compounds Sm VS2 (N[4-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]guanidine) and Sm VS3 (N-[4-(4-methylphenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]guanidine) have similar structures, differing only by an additional methyl substitution in Sm VS2 (Fig. 1). The predicted binding mode is also very similar in both cases. However, in Sm VS2 the dimethylphenyl group possesses a different orientation in the ribose binding site due to the presence of the second methyl group in comparison with Sm VS3. The guanidine group of both compounds interacts directly with E203 and N245 of the base binding site. In the case of Sm VS2, two hydrogen bonds are formed with both E203 and N245, and the dimethylphenyl group is accommodated within the ribose binding site, the most hydrophobic part of the PNP active site. Compound Sm VS3, despite its similarity with Sm VS2, makes only one hydrogen bond with E203 whilst its methylphenyl group also occupies the ribose binding site, making hydrophobic contacts. 3.2. Activity assays and IC50 determination Twenty-two of the selected compounds were used in a single point inhibition assay. Two of the compounds, being insoluble in DMSO, were not tested. The assay served to discriminate false hits from true ligands and as a filter for choosing compounds for subsequent soaking experiments and IC50 determinations. Three of the 20 remaining compounds showed inhibitor activity against SmPNP and one of them, Sm VS1, inhibited completely the enzyme at a concentration of 100 M. Sm VS2 and Sm VS3, which are quite similar (differing only in the presence of a methyl group as described

above), inhibited 79.5% and 70.6% respectively. These three compounds were selected for IC50 determination. Compound Sm VS1 possesses an IC50 of 1.30 ± 0.07 M (a result which is surprising low for a monocyclic compound) and is able to form H-bonds with both base and ribose binding site. In comparison, the KM value for the substrate inosine is about 7 M (Pereira et al., 2003). Sm VS2 and Sm VS3, when submitted to the IC50 determination proved to be promiscuous inhibitors due to protein precipitation and we have so far been unable to obtain crystal structures for these complexes. It should be pointed out that purine analogues have been used previously in the treatment of Schistomiasis, including tubercidin which at a concentration of 100 M induces the separation of male and female adult worms (Dovey et al., 1985; El Kouni, 1991; El Kouni et al., 1987). Furthermore immucillins have shown great promise for the treatment of parasitic diseases such as malaria, having Ki values within the nanomolar to picomolar range (Evans et al., 2003; Schramm, 2002; Fedorov et al., 2001; Clinch et al., 2009). However, the enzyme from Plasmodium belongs to the high molecular weight class of PNPs which are significantly different to that from the human host, facilitating the development of parasite specific inhibitors. There is, therefore, still a need for finding alternative lead compounds particularly for parasites such as Schistosomes which, like there hosts, possess low molecular weight PNPs. Sm VS1 therefore appeared to merit further attention. Monocyclic compounds have yet to be described as efficient PNPs inhibitors, and the identification of Sm VS1 opens up possibilities for the design of more powerful compounds based in this novel non-purine sub-structure that could be useful in the treatment of schistosomiasis. 3.3. Structure description The SmPNP structure in complex with Sm VS1 is similar to others previously described (Pereira et al., 2005). The RMSd for all C s between the Sm VS1 complex structure and that with acetate (1TD1) was only 0.18 Å. Some residues could not be located in the electron density and therefore were removed from the final structure (subunit A residues 1­4, 63­65; subunit B residues 1­3, 62­65, 253­267; subunit C residues 1­2). When compared with SmPNP in complex with hypoxanthine (PDB code 3FNQ) the RMSd is 0.52 Å and there are no remarkable differences between the structures from the point of view of the polypeptide chain. The similar binding mode suggests that Sm VS1 may act as a competitive inhibitor with respect to natural substrates. After rigid body refinement it was possible to identify electron density corresponding to the Sm VS1 molecule in all three active sites and the structure was placed into this density using the program Coot. The Fo-Fc electron density map showing both the Sm VS1 molecule and the base binding site of SmPNP can be seen in Fig. 2. The final structure has 6315 protein atoms, 584 water molecules, 1 molecule of Sm VS1 and 1 molecule of DMSO per subunit. The final R and RFree values are 18.1% and 24.2% respectively, and 91.1% of the residues are in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot. The full data collection and processing statistics are given in Table 1.

Fig. 2. Fo-Fc electron density omit map (contoured at 3 ) for the Sm VS1 bound to subunit C of SmPNP. Hydrogen bonds between the ligand and active site residues and water molecules are shown. In total Sm VS1 makes eight direct contacts within the active site explaining its affinity for SmPNP.

3.4. The active site description The active site of the binary complex contains one molecule of Sm VS1 and one water molecule. Despite its low molecular weight (206 Da) difference density for the Sm VS1 compound was clearly visible indicating the ligand form a large number of H-bond interactions with active site residues, all situated within the base binding site. In total, Sm VS1 makes eight H-bonds with key residues (four with E203, three with N245 and one with T244) as well as two H-bonds with water molecules (Fig. 2). When compared with the unliganded structure, the base binding site shows slight differences mainly involving N245, whose C and C atoms are shifted by 0.6 Å and 0.8 Å respectively. This is the result of

Fig. 3. Superposition of the base binding sites of both liganded (white) and unliganded structures (green). The binding of Sm VS1 caused small rearrangements to the base binding site, principally to N245, which included the flipping of its side chain enabling the formation of three hydrogen bonds with Sm VS1.

an altered orientation (Fig. 3), which includes flipping of the side chain, a movement which allows N245 to interact tightly with Sm VS1. When all three subunits have been superposed it is possible to perform a comparison of the binding mode of Sm VS1 in the active sites. In subunits A and C, Sm VS1 binds similarly. However, in subunit B the ligand binds more deeply within the active site being shifted in the direction of N245, and for this reason the side chains of T244 and N245 move slightly in comparison with subunit A (0.42 Å and 0.54 Å). Nevertheless, the same H-bonding network is retained in all cases and we have no specific explanation for the differences seen in subunit B. This is consistent with our (and others) observation of a high degree of flexibility and conformational variability within the PNP active site. When the virtual screening and crystallographic poses are compared, it can be seen that the GOLD program has faithfully predicted the binding mode of Sm VS1 (Fig. 4). The RMSd for all heavy atoms between the pose and crystallographic structure is 1.06 Å and the pose correctly predicts six out of the eight experimentally observed H-bonds to active site residues. In fact two virtual screens were performed, the first one with the original structure derived from the acetate complex and the second with the side chain of N245 flipped. Only in the second case is Sm VS1 a high scoring hit presenting the expected pose in the base binding site. This emphasizes the importance of target flexibility at all levels (side chains, main chains, domain movement, etc.) which is clearly a critical limitation for the success of virtual screening. One possible solution is the use of multiple structures in the virtual screening process. This was possible in the present case due to the known flexibility of the active site. This may be less easy in other cases where little may be known about target flexibility. However it emphasizes the need for the use of multiple structures wherever possible. Indeed, one of the practical advantages of the increased rate at which protein structures can now be obtained (and the potential of high throughput methods) is the possibility to better sample energetically accessible conformations via multiple structure determination. Indeed, the use of multiple structures has

site. It is well known that bromine can be readily substituted by other groups during synthetic chemistry and this could be potentially exploited in order to build a new generation of Sm VS1-based compounds by "growing" into the ribose binding pocket. It is to be expected that such larger compounds will have improved affinity. However it is already encouraging that a rapid virtual screening coupled to a simple enzyme assay was able to detect a novel nonnucleotide based inhibitor of M affinity which has the potential to be developed into a lead compound.

Fig. 4. Comparison of the virtual screening pose (green) and the crystallographically determined structure (white). The program GOLD correctly predicted the binding mode of Sm VS1 in the active site (RMSd between the two positions was 1.08 Å). This difference is probably due to the small rearrangements observed in the active site of the crystal structure which seem to be necessary in order to accommodate the ligand.

been used in the design of focused fragment libraries (Hartshorn et al., 2005, Howard et al., 2006). Comparison with SmPNP in complex with hypoxanthine (Fig. 5) reveals that the latter forms only four hydrogen bonds with active site residues (one with E203, two with N245 and one with A118) plus three with two water molecules. No significant differences are observed in the active site residues of the two complexes, and Sm VS1 occupies essentially the same volume of space and is coplanar with the hypoxanthine molecule (Fig. 5). The orientation of Sm VS1 in the active site of SmPNP further shows the bromine atom to be pointing towards the ribose binding
