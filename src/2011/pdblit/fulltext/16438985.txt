Abstract Papaya glutamine cyclotransferase (PQC), present in the laticiferous cells of the tropical species Carica papaya, was purified near to homogeneity. Starting from the soluble fraction of the collected plant latex, a combination of ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose Fast Flow, hydrophobic interaction chromatography on Fractogel TSK Butyl-650 and affinity chromatography on immobilized trypsin provided a purification factor of 279 with an overall yield of 80%. In the course of the purification procedure, the two solvent accessible thiol functions located on the hydrophobic surface of the enzyme were converted into their S-methylthioderivatives. Papaya QC, a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 33 000 Da, contains a unique and highly basic polypeptide chain devoid of disulfide bridges as well as of covalently attached phosphate groups. Its absorption spectrum is dominated by the chromophores tyrosine which, nonetheless, do not contribute to the fluorescence emission of the plant enzyme. With a Vmax of emission at 338 nm and a moderate susceptibility to be quenched by acrylamide, most of the tryptophyl residues of papaya QC appear to be sterically shielded by surrounding protein atoms. Fluorescence can thus be used to monitor unfolding of this enzyme. Preliminary experiments show that papaya QC is exceptionally resistant to chemical (guanidinium hydrochloride), acid and thermal denaturation. At first sight also, this enzyme exhibits high resistance to proteolysis by the papaya cysteine proteinases, yet present in great excess (around 100 mol of proteinases per mol of PQC) in the plant latex. Altogether, these results awaken much curiosity and interest to further investigate how the structure of this plant enzyme is specified. ß 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Glutaminyl peptide cyclotransferases (QCs) (EC 2.3.2.5) catalyze the conversion of L-glutaminyl peptides into 5-oxoprolyl peptides with, as shown in Eq.

1, the concomitant liberation of ammonia [1].

1 Before QCs were identi¢ed as true catalysts for this reaction, the presence of pyroglutamic acid at the N-terminal position of peptides and proteins was thought to result from the spontaneous and

abiotic cyclization of glutaminyl precursors and, as a consequence, did not create much interest [2]. Participation of QCs, so far, is fairly well established only in the context of the biosynthesis of hormonal and neurotransmitter peptides. Most of, if not all, such peptides are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as biologically inactive precursors which are then secreted [3]. Processing of the precursors calls on di¡erent enzymes among which QCs can play a role in cooperation with peptidases, peptidylglycine K-amidating monooxygenases, etc. [4^6]. In some cases only, e.g. for the pyroglutamyl (= 5-oxopropyl) peptides thyrotropin-, gonadotropin- and corticotropin-releasing hormones, the presence of 5oxoproline at the N-terminal position is absolutely required to confer biological activity to the peptides [7,8]. On the other hand, little is known as yet about structural and enzymological properties of QCs. In order to be able to perform such studies, disposal of su¤cient material is a prerequisite. We therefore opt for the reinvestigation of extraction of PQC from papaya latex, previously cited as a potentially rich source of the enzyme [9]. This choice was also dictated by our general interest for plant proteinases ([10] and Refs. therein). As mentioned in the literature, QCs are often associated with proteinases. This is the case as described above for mammalian QC [3] as well as for the plant enzyme in the course of the mobilization of the seed protein storage during germination [11^13]. We thus ¢rst reinvestigated the puri¢cation of PQC and characterized this plant enzyme with special emphasis on its resistance to denaturation and proteolysis. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Aldrich-Chemie (Steinheim, Germany) provided dithiothreitol (DTT), 2,2P-dipyridyldisul¢de (2PDS), K-methyl-D-glucopyranoside and methylmethanethiolsulfonate. L-Glutamine-t-butyl ester (GlntBu), NADH, K-ketoglutaric acid, N-K-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA), N-acetyl-Ltryptophan, N-acetyl-L-tryptophan ethyl ester (NATEE), glutamate dehydrogenase (type VI), bovine

trypsin (type XIII) and casein were purchased from Sigma (Bornem, Belgium). Hen egg white lysozyme was supplied by Belovo (Bastogne, Belgium). A¤gel10, the chemicals for SDS-PAGE and PAGE and the molecular mass protein standards for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Nazareth Eke, Belgium). Guanidinium hydrochloride (spectroscopic grade; Gu-HCl), tri£uoromethanesulfonic acid and soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Pharmacia Biotechnol. (Uppsala, Sweden) provided SP-Sepharose Fast Flow and Con-A Sepharose and Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) Fractogel TSK Butyl-650(M). Immobilization of trypsin on A¤gel-10 was performed according to recommendations by the manufacturer. The resulting gel exhibited the capacity to bind 0.25 Wmol of STI per ml of gel. The commercially available papaya latex used here as one of the starting materials for purifying PQC was provided by Enzymase International (Brussels, Belgium) as the spray-dried soluble fraction (papain: grade P1). 2.2. Preparation and puri¢cation of PQC All the operations were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise stated. 2.2.1. Step 1: inactivation of the cysteine proteinases Papain P1 (50 g) was dissolved in water (200 ml), the pH adjusted to 7 by adding solid Tris-base and inactivation of the cysteine proteinases was immediately obtained by adding methylmethanethiolsulfonate [14]. The resulting suspension was stirred for 30 min before being submitted to centrifugation (35 000Ug; 30 min; 4³C). The solution was then dialyzed against H2 O (4³C; 24 h) followed by 100 mM sodium acetate bu¡er at pH 5 (4³C; 24 h). Throughout this work, the molarities of sodium acetate bu¡ers always refer to the Na concentrations. 2.2.2. Step 2: fractionation of the papaya enzymes on SP-Sepharose Fast Flow An aliquot of the dialyzed solution from step 1 containing 2 g of the mixture of papaya enzymes, was applied to a (30U2.6 cm i.d.) column of SPSepharose Fast Flow preequilibrated with 100 mM sodium acetate bu¡er at pH 5 (start bu¡er). After the protein sample was loaded onto the column, a linear

277

elution gradient (total volume: 1500 ml) from 100 to 800 mM sodium acetate bu¡er at pH 5 was applied at a £ow rate of 62.5 ml/h. Fractions of 15.6 ml were collected; each individual chromatographic fraction was analyzed by measurement of A280 , conductivity, amidase and PQC activities. The chromatographic fractions showing PQC activity were pooled and concentrated by ultra¢ltration (Amicon; molecular mass cut-o¡ of the membrane=3000 Da). 2.2.3. Step 3: further puri¢cation of PQC on Fractogel TSK Butyl-650 Solid ammonium sulfate (up to 2 M) was added to the pooled papaya enzyme (723 mg) solution from the ion-exchange chromatography step. This sample was applied on a (14U2.6 cm i.d.) column of Fractogel TSK Butyl-650 preequilibrated in 2 M ammonium sulfate (start eluent). The start eluent ( þ 250 ml) was then pumped through followed by a linear gradient (total volume: 1625 ml) from 2 to 0 M ammonium sulfate and ¢nally by H2 O. Elution was performed at a £ow rate of 65 ml/h and fractions of 16 ml were collected. Each individual chromatographic fraction was analyzed by measurement of A280 , conductivity, amidase and trypsin inhibitory activities. Pools of fractions were further analyzed by measurement of PQC activity after ammonium ions were removed by ultra¢ltration followed by dialysis against H2 O. 2.2.4. Step 4: removal of papaya trypsin inhibitor (PTI) on immobilized trypsin The PQC containing chromatographic fractions issued from the Fractogel column were pooled and the resulting solution submitted to concentration by ultra¢ltration (Amicon; molecular mass cut-o¡ of the membrane = 3000 Da) and to dialysis against 2U2 l of 20 mM CaCl2 in 50 mM Tris-HCl bu¡er at pH 8.2 (start bu¡er) (24 h; 4³C). An aliquot of the dialyzed solution containing about 100 mg of partially puri¢ed PQC was then applied to a (12.5U1.6 cm i.d.) column of immobilized trypsin gel preequilibrated in the start bu¡er. After the sample was loaded onto the column, the start eluent was pumped through until the A280 reading returned to its baseline value. Elution of PTI was then performed by pumping 20 mM HCl through the column. The chromatographic fractions constituting the ¢rst eluting peak were

pooled and after concentration by ultra¢ltration, the solution of PQC was exhaustively dialyzed against H2 O at 4³C. PQC solution was stored in the frozen state, at 320³C. 2.3. SDS-PAGE and PAGE experiments Experiments were carried out on slab gels using the Mini Protean II cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For the SDS-PAGE experiments, the resolving gel (pH 8.8, 12% acrylamide) was run at a constant intensity (35 mA) and prepared according to Laemmli [15]. The stacking gel consisted of 4% polyacrylamide (pH 6.8). The upper and lower chambers contained Tris-glycine bu¡er (pH 8.3) containing 0.1% SDS. Separation was towards the anode and bromophenol blue was used as the tracking dye. Before being loaded onto the gels, the protein samples were diluted with a bu¡ered solution containing 25% TrisHCl 1 M, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 23% glycerol and 1% bromophenol blue and boiled for 4 min. The gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue R250 dissolved in a methanol/acetic acid/water (9:2:9) solution. The same solution was also used for destaining. The molecular mass standards were lysozyme (14 300), STI (21 500), carbonic anhydrase (31 000), ovalbumin (45 000), bovine serum albumin (66 200) and phosphorylase B (97 400). For the PAGE experiments, slabs of polyacrylamide were prepared according to the method of Gabriel [16]. The separating gels were 7.5% acrylamide (pH 4.3) and the stacking gels were 3% (pH 6.8). Bu¡er in both the upper and the lower electrode chambers was L-alanine/acetic acid (pH 4.3). Separation was towards the cathode and methylene green (prepared in a 20% glycerol solution at pH 6.8) was used as the tracking dye. Gels were stained with 0.08% Coomassie brilliant blue R250 dissolved in the washing solution. This latter, which also served for destaining, contained methanol/acetic acid/water (2:1:7). Electrophoresis were carried out at 4³C by applying an intensity of 40 mA per slab gel for 75 min. 2.4. Measurement of catalytic activities 2.4.1. Measurement of PQC activity The basis of the PQC assay used here is the coupling of the ammonia produced upon cyclization of

the N-terminal glutamine residue of a substrate (GlntBu) to the K-ketoglutarate in the glutamate dehydrogenase (GD) catalyzed reaction: NH3  K3ketoglutarate NADHÀ glutamate  NAD 3 In this assay, the released ammonia is proportional to the decrease in A340 resulting from the conversion of NADH to NAD [17]. Each test Eppendorf cap tube contained, in a ¢nal volume of 200 Wl, K-ketoglutarate (13.3 mM), NADH (0.65 mM), GD (0.4 unit), GlntBu (6.6 mM) and an appropriately diluted aliquot of PQC. The dilution factor was calculated so as to lead to ¢nal A340 readings of about 0.4, still in the linear part of the absorbance decrease. The dilution bu¡er was 16 mM Tris-acetate at pH 8.2. Assay cocktails were routinely prepared within 1 h before use and stored at 4³C. PQC was added to initiate the reaction (H2 O instead of PQC solution was used for the controls) which proceeded at 37³C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 800 Wl of chilled H2 O and A340 was immediately recorded. The activity was quanti¢ed by comparison of the recorded A340 with a standard curve constructed with ammonium sulfate solutions of known concentrations. One unit of PQC activity is the amount of enzyme that produced one Wmol of ammonia per minute under the conditions described here. 2.4.2. Measurement of amidase activity The amidase activity of the papaya proteinases papain, chymopapain and caricain and of bovine trypsin was measured using BAPNA as the substrate [18]. For the papaya enzymes, the reaction mixture (2 ml) contained 10% DMSO and ¢nal concentrations of 1 mM substrate, 2.5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and up to 2 WM proteinase in a bu¡er containing citrate, borate and phosphate (100 mM each) at pH 6.8. Each proteinase was preincubated at 37³C for 15 min in the bu¡er containing EDTA and DTT before the reaction was started by adding the substrate (prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO). For bovine trypsin, the reaction mixture (1.5 ml) contained 1% DMSO and ¢nal concentrations of
GD

0.83 mM substrate, 20 mM CaCl2 and up to 270 nM trypsin in 50 mM Tris-HCl bu¡er at pH 8.2. The reaction was started by adding the enzyme and proceeded at 25³C for 15 min. In both cases, the reaction was stopped by adding acetic acid (¢nal concentration: 2 M). The release of 4-nitroaniline was determined spectrophotometrically using O410 = 8800 M31 cm31 . One unit of amidase activity (nkat ) is the amount of proteinase that hydrolyzed 1 nmol of substrate per second. 2.5. Fluorescence measurements Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu RF-5001PC spectro£uorometer. Unless otherwise stated, excitation was at 295 nm and temperature 25³C. Emission and excitation bandwidths were 5.0 and 1.5 nm respectively. Calculation of £uorescence quantum yields was carried out according to the method of Parker and Rees which is based on the comparison of the £uorescence and the absorbance of the tested solution (t) to those of a reference solution (ref) with a known quantum yield, which leads to the equation: qt F t Aref  U qref F ref At where q states for quantum yield, F (the area under the emission curve) for £uorescence and A for absorbance (measured at the excitation wavelength). NAcetyl-L-tryptophan (quantum yield = 0.286) was used as reference [19]. 2.6. Other spectroscopic and analytical methods The conductivities (mS) were measured with a radiometer conductivity meter CDM3 equipped with a radiometer measurement cell type CDC314. The mS values were measured at constant temperature. pH values were measured using the pHM-84 meter. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using O278 = 55 490, 44 415, 38 690 and 41 490 M31 cm31 for papain, chymopapain, caricain and glycyl endopeptidase, O280 = 36 280 M31 cm31 for bovine trypsin and O279 = 26 270 M31 cm31 for PTI. These values were calculated using information (Mr ; contents of Trp, Tyr and disul¢de bonds) provided by their amino acid sequences [20^25] and the known

O values of the various chromophores contributing to their near-UV absorption spectra [26]. Absorbances were measured with a Varian DMS 300 spectrophotometer. The carbohydrate, phosphate and free thiol contents of PQC were evaluated according to standard protocols [14,27,28]. Brie£y, the presence of free thiol group(s) was detected as follows. The thiol group(s), if really present, blocked as S-methylthioderivative(s) was (were) unmasked by incubating the enzyme in the presence of 2.5 mM DTT in 100 mM sodium acetate bu¡er at pH 5 (30 min; room temperature). The excess of reducing reagent was then eliminated by passage through a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (10U1 cm i.d.) column preequilibrated and eluted with 100 mM sodium acetate bu¡er at pH 5. Adsorbed PQC (0.94 Wmol based on a molecular mass of 33 kDa and an absorbance of a 1% solution at 280 nm of 14.3 [9]) was eluted from the column with 2 M sodium acetate bu¡er at pH 5 and collected in a solution containing 4 Wmol of 2-PDS. The amount of released 2-thiopyridone was measured at 343 nm. Characterization of the PQC's glycan moiety(ies) was also obtained by studying the elution pattern of the glycoprotein on a (5.5U1.6 cm i.d.) column of Con-A Sepharose preequilibrated with 500 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl bu¡er at pH 7.4 (binding bu¡er). The dialyzed (against the binding bu¡er) sample of PQC was loaded onto the column. The start eluent (250 ml) was pumped through followed by a linear gradient (total volume: 600 ml) from 0 to 500 mM K-D-methylglucoside in the binding bu¡er. Elution was carried out at 25³C with a £ow rate of 23.25 ml/h. Fractions of 6.2 ml were collected and analyzed by measurement of A280 and PQC activity. 3. Results To our knowledge, only one member of the QC family has so far been puri¢ed to homogeneity. This highly puri¢ed enzyme preparation, which contained only 38 Wg of protein material, was obtained from not less than 1085 bovine pituitaries with a 10% overall yield [29]. Owing to this unique enzyme preparation, however, the complete nucleotide sequences of beef and human QCs are now available [29,30]. Their predicted amino acid sequences, which show

86% identity, consist of propeptides of 28 amino acids and of mature proteins containing 333 amino acid residues. Their amino acid sequences also show some similarity (about 30%) with that of a hypothetical 41 kDa protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [31]. Both mammalian QCs contain several putative glycosylation and phosphorylation sites which are well conserved. On the basis of the primary structure of bovine QC, a molecular weight of 36 300 may be calculated for the polypeptide chain while an apparent molecular weight of 38 000^40 000 was determined from experiments using SDS-PAGE and gel ¢ltration [29], thus suggesting that native mammalian QCs may well be true glycosylated and possibly phosphorylated proteins. As a consequence, it is expected that attempts to produce QCs using recombinant technologies in order to obtain substantial amounts of native QCs needed for investigating structural and enzymological properties, may fail to provide structurally relevant polypeptide chains. Therefore, it might be more advantageous to reinvestigate the extraction of PQC from papaya latex, a rich source of this enzyme [9]. Since its discovery, probably as soon as 1938 [32], two attempts to purify PQC have been reported [9,11]. Puri¢cation by ionexchange chromatography solely led to a ¢rst PQC preparation heavily contaminated by proteinase(s) [9]. Later on, further puri¢cation making use of a phenyl-Sepharose column provided a 40-fold puri¢ed PQC preparation starting from the soluble fraction of the crude papaya extract. Homogeneity of this PQC preparation may be questioned considering the 279-fold puri¢cation factor we obtained starting with a similar material. Indeed, no details or illustrations were given in this report by Gololobov and coworkers [11]. 3.1. Puri¢cation of PQC In the absence of available antibody(ies) raised against PQC, detection of the plant enzyme in the course of its puri¢cation can only rely on its catalytic activity. QCs, including the papaya enzyme, show a¤nity for substrates such as L-glutaminyl peptides or L-glutaminyl esters with a bias for L-glutamine [9,11,12,30]. Such substrates are also susceptible to be degraded by unspeci¢c proteinases. Laticifers of

Fig. 1. Fractionation of the papaya enzymes on SP-Sepharose Fast Flow. Each chromatographic fraction was analyzed by measurements of A280 (continuous trace), PQC (R) and amidase (b) activities and conductivity (dotted trace). For details, see Section 2. Peaks: I, papain (EC 3.4.22.2) [35]; II and III, unresolved mixture of glycyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.22.25) and of several isoforms of chymopapain (EC 3.4.22.6) [10]; IV and V, caricain (EC 3.4.22.30) [36], PQC and PTI. The chromatographic fractions, selected for further puri¢cation, were pooled as indicated by the solid bar.

Carica papaya are a particularly rich source of cysteine proteinases [20^23]. It may be calculated, from the known composition of papaya latex, that the

exudate produced by the plant upon wounding should contain these proteinases, in an active form, at a 1 mM concentration. With the exception of

glycyl endopeptidase [23], the three other proteinases are unspeci¢c [33]. Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that GD, another essential constituent of the QC assay, may also be a substrate for the papaya proteinases. As expected, preliminary tests indicated that active papaya proteinases, when present, strongly interfered with the PQC activity measurements (not shown). As a consequence, the main objective of the ¢rst step in the proposed puri¢cation scheme consists in inactivating the papaya proteinases with methylmethanethiolsulfonate [14]. The four cysteine proteinases present in papaya latex are inactivated while the PQC activity indeed remains una¡ected [9,11,12]. Methylthioderivatives of enzymes are normally stable but should readily be converted into the native (thiol-containing) form in the presence of an excess of low molecular weight mercaptan (such as DTT). GD being inactivated by thiol reagents [34], methylmethanethiolsulfonate itself is susceptible to interfere with the PQC assay.
Table 1 Puri¢cation scheme of PQC from C. papaya latex

Therefore, the excess of reagent was carefully eliminated through dialysis at the end of the ¢rst puri¢cation step. Ion-exchange chromatography fractionated the papaya enzymes into ¢ve distinct chromatographic peaks denoted I^V in Fig. 1. The hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), illustrated in Fig. 2, allowed to isolate a PQC fraction almost devoid of contaminating proteolytic activity. Some could, however, be detected using casein as the substrate. Chromatography on an immobilized trypsin support resulted in the complete separation of PQC (present in the void volume) from PTI. Elution of the inhibitor was achieved with 20 mM HCl as previously suggested [25]. The results of the stepwise puri¢cation procedure are summarized in Table 1. The recovery of PTI (56.8 mg) was in fair agreement with the value determined by Odani and co-workers [25]. Puri¢cation of PQC is further illustrated in Fig. 3 which shows the results of the SDS-PAGE and PAGE ex-

periments. Traces of molecular species having an apparent molecular mass of about 24 000 Da are still visible after step 3 (Fig. 3A, lane 4). This may be attributed to the presence of PTI in the PQC preparation. Indeed, the calculated molecular mass of the polypeptide chain of PTI is 20 655 Da while the molecular mass of the carbohydrate chain, determined by mass spectrometry, is 2845 Da [25]. Puri¢ed PQC after step 4 showed a main band (Fig. 3A, lane 5) migrating between carbonic anhydrase (31 000) and ovalbumin (45 000) but, by far, closer to carbonic anhydrase. The results reported by Gololobov et al. on a renaturation experiment of the protein eluted from the SDS-PAGE gel indicated that the PQC activity corresponded only to the band migrating at 33 000 Da [11]. This ¢nding is in excellent agreement with the molecular mass determined here. After step 4, only trace amounts of contaminants were still detectable by SDS-PAGE. PAGE did not reveal any traces of these contaminants (Fig. 3B, lane 1). 3.2. Preliminary characterization of PQC The papaya cysteine proteinases elute from the SPSepharose Fast Flow column in the order of their increasing isoelectric points (pI). Using the `isoelectric program' [37], pI values of 8.76, 9.80, 9.85 and 10.52 can respectively be calculated for papain, glycyl endopeptidase, chymopapain and caricain. Similarly, the pI of PTI was calculated to be 9.83. Fig. 1 shows that the bulk of the PQC activity peak binds even more strongly to SP-Sepharose Fast Flow than the most basic papaya proteinase caricain. On the other hand, Fig. 2 shows that PQC also strongly binds to the hydrophobic chromatographic support Fractogel TSK Butyl-650. In this respect, PQC behaves like PTI (this work) and papain [35]. According to its elution pro¢le on ion-exchange and hydrophobic chromatographic supports, PQC may thus be described as an enzyme with extreme basicity and hydrophobicity. The presence, on PQC, of glycan moiety(ies) was examined since putative sites of glycosylation had previously been identi¢ed in mammalian QCs [29,30]. Hydrolysis of PQC, using tri£uoromethanesulfonic acid as the catalyst, was performed under experimental conditions reported to selectively remove glycans from glycoproteins [38]. As revealed

Fig. 3. SDS-PAGE (A) and PAGE (B) experiments performed in the course of the puri¢cation of PQC. (A) Lanes: 1 and 6, molecular mass standards (Da) including (from top to bottom) phosphatase B (97 400), bovine serum albumin (66 200), ovalbumin (45 000), carbonic anhydrase (31 000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21 500) and lysozyme (14 300); 2, the unfractionated mixture of papaya enzymes; 3^5, the PQC chromatographic fractions after ion-exchange chromatography (step 2), hydrophobic interaction chromatography (step 3) and a¤nity chromatography on immobilized bovine trypsin (step 4) respectively. (B) Lanes: 1, the PQC after step 4; 2, the methylthiolated puri¢ed papain; 3, the unfractionated mixture of papaya enzymes.

by SDS-PAGE, such hydrolysis resulted in the reduction of the molecular mass of PQC from 33 000 to about 26 000 Da (results not shown). Moreover, when the phenol-sulfuric test described by Saha and Brewer [27] was applied on lyophilized PQC samples (0.15 Wmol) redissolved in water (500 Wl), a heavy brown-red color developed instantly. Less staining was observed with 0.20 and 0.40 Wmol of the mixture of caseins (containing, according to the manufacturer, 0.2% of lactose), 0.15 Wmol of sucrose and 0.25 Wmol of glucose or K-methyl-D-mannopyranoside. No color appeared with hen egg white lyso-

zyme, devoid of carbohydrates. We thus conclude from the comparison with these two sets of experiments that PQC is a glycoprotein. The results obtained after chromatography on Con-A Sepharose suggested that PQC exhibits a moderate to low speci¢c a¤nity towards concanavalin. This conclusion was based upon the observation that PQC, in the absence of K-D-methylglucoside, did bind to the lectin a¤nity chromatographic support. Binding of PQC to concanavalin most probably involves the participation of its glycan moiety(ies) since it was observed even in the presence of (500 mM) NaCl in the binding bu¡er and was reversed by adding K-D-methylglucoside in the eluting bu¡er. A¤nity of PQC towards concanavalin may, however, be quali¢ed as moderate to low since the plant QC eluted from the a¤nity column early after the K-Dmethylglucoside pulse was applied. It should be pointed out here that the elution pattern of PTI on the Con-A Sepharose column was similar to that of PQC. It was thus realized that, in the context of puri¢cation of the plant QC, a¤nity chromatography on Con-A Sepharose should be of little help.

We also looked for phosphate residues covalently attached to the plant QC. By the method of Buss and Stull [28], no inorganic phosphorus could be detected either in the PQC preparation or in a lysozyme sample (a protein known to lack covalently bound phosphate groups). In both cases, the A660 readings were the same as those of the blank. Such readings were observed for protein quantities as high as 21 nmol of PQC and 70 nmol of hen egg white lysozyme. On the contrary, phosphate could readily be detected with the phosphoproteins caseins in a sample containing 0.33 nmol of the bovine milk caseins. The presence of free thiol group(s) in PQC, investigated for the ¢rst time in the course of the present work, was shown as described in Section 2. An increase in A343 due to the liberation of 2-thiopyridone from 2-PDS was observed. Assuming an O343 = 7700 M31 cm31 for 2-thiopyridone, a ratio of 1.27 mol of thiol function per mol of protein was determined [14]. We realized that this value di¡ered from an integer because a fraction of the free thiol functions present in the native enzyme had been injured (e.g. was oxidized in the course of the manufacture of

Fig. 5. E¡ect of pH upon the £uorescence emission of PQC at 25³C. Solutions of PQC were prepared by accurately diluting an aqueous solution of the enzyme in 50 mM bu¡ers of known pH values and containing 150 mM KCl. Bu¡ers included: glycine-HCl (1.5^ 2.7), HCOOH-HCOONa (2.7^4.5), CH3 COOH-CH3 COONa (4.5^5.7) and KH2 PO4 -Na2 HPO4 (5.5^6.0). Fluorescence emission spectra (Vexc = 295 nm) were recorded after a 24 h incubation period at 25³C and therefrom Vmax (b) and £uorescence intensities at Vmax (F) were determined and plotted as a function of pH (experimentally determined after having recorded the £uorescence spectra).

papain P1). In order to check this assumption, PQC was puri¢ed from papaya latex (instead of papain P1), collected in the presence of an aqueous solution of methylmethanethiolsulfonate and submitted to lyophilization within 3 h after its collection. The freeze-dried powder was stored and packaged at 320³C until used for the puri¢cation of PQC. That PQC sample, unlike the enzyme prepared from papain P1, contained 1.95 mol of SH per mol of enzyme. 3.3. Spectral characteristics in the near-UV region and £uorometric characteristics of PQC PQC aqueous solutions are quite transparent in the visible region (350^700 nm). The electronic absorption spectrum of the plant enzyme (investigated within the pH range 2^9) in the near-UV region (250^320 nm) shows that tyrosyl and tryptophyl residues, present in the polypeptide chain, constitute the sole aromatic chromophores which signi¢cantly contribute to the spectrum. With a maximum located at 279 nm and the presence of an inconspicuous should-

er near 290 nm, it can be further suggested that the UV spectrum of PQC is dominated by the chromophore tyrosine [26]. The results described in the last paragraph of Section 3.2 prompted us to determine the molar extinction coe¤cient at 279 nm (Vmax ) of PQC. An O279 value of about 45 000 M31 cm31 was ¢rst estimated for the puri¢ed methylthioderivative by measuring the A279 of an aqueous enzyme solution and by determining the mass of enzyme obtained by lyophilization of a known volume of that solution. Assuming that the correct value of free thiol content of PQC is 2.00, a value of 48 500 M31 cm31 was accurately determined for O279 . The £uorescence emission spectrum of the S-methyl(di)thioderivative of PQC in phosphate bu¡er at pH 7, after excitation at 295 nm, was characterized by a maximum emission (Vmax ) at 338 nm and a quantum yield (q) of 0.120. Such a Vmax value shows that the aromatic residues responsible for the £uorescence emission of PQC are located in a rather moderate apolar environment. The parameters (Vmax and q) characterizing the £uorescence emission of PQC and of NATEE were also measured as a

Fig. 6. E¡ect of temperature on the £uorescence emission of PQC at pH 6. The £uorescence emission spectra (Vexc = 295 nm) of a solution of PQC in a 50 mM phosphate bu¡er containing 150 mM KCl at pH 6 were recorded at various temperatures between 25 and 90³C. Vmax (b) and £uorescence intensities at Vmax (F) were determined at each temperature after an incubation period (about 10 min) which secured reproducibility of the results. Incubation of the enzyme at a given temperature T (³C) never exceeded 25 min.

function of Vexc (from 275 to 300 nm). Since their emission spectra exhibited the same dependence on Vexc , it was concluded that only tryptophyl residues did signi¢cantly contribute to the £uorescence emission of the plant QC. The environment of tryptophyl residues of PQC was further characterized by determining their degree of accessibility to acrylamide. Acrylamide is a polar, uncharged compound that has been shown to quench the £uorescence of indole derivatives predominately by a collisional process. The latter is classically described by the Stern-Volmer equation: F 0 aF  1  K sv quencher where F0 and F are the £uorescence intensities at an appropriate emission wavelength in the absence and presence of the quencher and Ksv is the collisional quenching constant, which is proportional to the ef¢ciency of quenching [39]. Interestingly, the quenching e¤ciency of tryptophyl residues in proteins by acrylamide is independent of the polarity of their microenvironment and depends solely on the frequency at which they can encounter an acrylamide molecule. Thus, depending on whether the indole

ring is sterically shielded by surrounding protein segments or not, the e¤ciency of quenching (Ksv ) by the probe will be low or high. The quenching of PQC by acrylamide at pH 7 (in 50 mM phosphate bu¡er) and 25³C obeyed to the Stern-Volmer equation. A value for Ksv of 50 M31 was calculated from the experimental results shown in Fig. 4. This value represented 33% of that characterizing the quenching of NATEE by acrylamide (also shown in Fig. 4) under identical experimental conditions otherwise 31 (Ksv = 149 M ). It may thus be concluded that, as a mean, two-third of the indole rings of PQC are sterically shielded by surrounding protein atoms. 3.4. Denaturation studies on PQC Denaturation of PQC is expected to be accompanied by a large red shift of intrinsic £uorescence emission spectra (theoretically from 338 to 355 nm which is the experimental value measured here for NATEE). Also, £uorescence shows the advantage to require low enzyme concentrations, typically less than 3 WM in the case of PQC. As a consequence, it is expected that this method should minimize aggre-

Fig. 7. Gu-HCl-induced unfolding of PQC at pH 6 and 25³C. Solutions were prepared from a solution of PQC in water, a 50 mM phosphate bu¡er at pH 6 and a stock solution of 7.2 M Gu-HCl in 50 mM phosphate bu¡er, pH 6. Fluorescence emission (Vexc = 295 nm) spectra were recorded after a 24 h incubation period, at 25³C, of the enzyme in the presence of the denaturant. Vmax (F) and £uorescence intensities at Vmax (b) were determined and plotted as a function of the Gu-HCl concentration. Fluorescence intensities at Vmax were corrected for the (spectroscopic) e¡ect of Gu-HCl on the £uorescence of NATEE, used as the reference.

gation of the enzyme, if any. For all these reasons, changes in PQC structure were thus investigated by means of intrinsic £uorescence. 3.4.1. Folding of PQC under low pH conditions Fig. 5 shows the £uorescence emission Vmax and the £uorescence intensities at Vmax measured at 25³C between pH 1.5 and 6. It can be seen that measurements of £uorescence intensities at Vmax clearly disclose the existence, in the pH range 2.9^ 3.9, of a discontinuity which may be interpreted as re£ecting a conformational transition. Indeed, the protonation of carboxylate functions arising from side chains of aspartic and/or glutamic acid residues is expected to lead to a quenching of the indole chains located in their proximity [19]. In marked contrast, Fig. 5 shows that acidi¢cation of PQC is rather accompanied by a dramatic increase of £uorescence intensities. The value of the quantum yield of PQC at pH 2.9 (q = 0.265) is more than twice that of the quantum yield of the native enzyme. Interest-

ingly, in the pH interval where the £uorometric transition is observed, Messer and Ottesen previously detected an abrupt drop of the PQC catalytic activity [9], an observation con¢rmed here (results not shown). Altogether, these results suggest that acidic pH values induce a global rather than a local structural change. It should, however, be pointed out that the Vmax values are only weakly a¡ected in the course of this structural change. Indeed, while at and above pH 3.9 Vmax values of 338 nm are observed, at and below pH 2.9 Vmax values of 341 nm are determined. These latter value is by far less than the value of 355 nm which is expected for tryptophyl side chains in a completely unfolded polypeptide chain. On the other hand, the folding of PQC under low pH conditions is not a¡ected by the presence of salts (not shown) which have the capacity to shadow conformational transitions [40]. It can be concluded that acidi¢cation of PQC does not induce an unfolding of the plant enzyme. It was further observed that the characteristics of the £uorescence emission of PQC, Vmax = 338

287

nm and q = 0.120, determined under weakly acidic conditions (pH 4^6) remains una¡ected in neutral and slightly alkaline (pH 6^10) milieu (results not shown). 3.4.2. Folding of PQC at high temperatures Fig. 6 shows the variation, at pH 5.98, of Vmax and £uorescence intensity (measured at Vmax ) of PQC when the incubation temperature was raised from 25 to 90³C. It can be seen that increasing the temperature up to 90³C, at a rate of not less than 1 C³/min, does not a¡ect the value of Vmax (338 þ 2 nm). On the other hand, as the temperature is increased the intrinsic £uorescence intensity of PQC decreased, as expected. However, no break or discontinuity in the £uorescence intensity versus temperature curve can be detected. No temperature-dependent structural transition could thus be disclosed in the course of these experiments, suggesting that PQC is quite thermostable. Gololobov et al. reported that incubation of PQC at 65³C for several hours did not result in any loss of its catalytic activity [11]. On the contrary, Messer and Ottesen observed that heating the enzyme at 75³C for 40 min resulted in a 50% loss of catalytic activity [9]. These authors, however, confessed that their PQC preparation contained about 1^2% of the total proteolytic activity initially present in papaya latex. One may thus calculate that their PQC preparation may be described as an equimolar mixture of proteinase (most probably caricain) and PQC. The loss of catalytic activity observed by Messer and Ottesen might thus well arise from the combination of proteolysis and thermal denaturation of PQC. 3.4.3. Folding of PQC in the presence of Gu-HCl Fig. 7 shows the variation, at 25³C, of Vmax and £uorescence intensity (measured at Vmax ) of PQC in the presence of Gu-HCl at concentrations ranging from 0 to 7 M. Measurements were performed after equilibrium was reached, typically after having incubated the enzyme and the chemical denaturant for 24 h at 25³C. It can be seen that both the £uorescence intensity and Vmax values are a¡ected by GuHCl. Fluorescence intensities increase with increasing Gu-HCl concentrations with no clearly apparent discontinuity. On the contrary, if low Gu-HCl concentrations (in the range 0^4 M) produce only limited

variations in Vmax , higher denaturant concentrations (between 4 and 7 M) induce larger Vmax increases. Even in the presence of 7 M Gu-HCl, the £uorescence emission spectrum of PQC never reached the 355 nm value of Vmax characteristic of the £uorescence spectra of tryptophyl residues in an aqueous environment. This ¢nding is another demonstration of the extraordinary stability of the enzyme in the experimental conditions described here. 4. Discussion Messer and Ottesen had anticipated that papaya latex was a rich source of PQC [41,42]. Their prediction was correct. With 143 mg (4.3 Wmol) of puri¢ed PQC from 50 g of the soluble fraction of papaya latex and a yield of 80%, one can indeed calculate that PQC represents not less than 1% of the set of papaya enzymes and that its concentration in the plant laticifers is around 10 WM. Such a concentration is from 100 to 1000 times higher than the grossly estimated one in beef pituitaries [29]. On the other hand, under the precise experimental conditions used here, our highly puri¢ed papaya enzyme exhibited a turnover number of 50 s31 using GlntBu as the substrate. In this respect, the e¤ciency of the plant enzyme seems quite comparable to that of the beef QC [29]. It thus becomes obvious that the contribution that PQC catalytic activity a¡ords to bring to physiological processes in plant cells may be di¡erent than that exerted by QC in animal tissues. The physiological function of the laticifers of C. papaya is not precisely known. A defensive role may, however, be evoked since all the known enzymes that they contain belong indeed to families of proteins implicated in plant defense mechanisms [43]. One can cite in this respect the four cysteine proteinases papain, chymopapain, glycyl endopeptidase and caricain [20^23], the PTI [25], various chitinases [44,45] and L-1,3-glucanase [46]. Whether or not PQC does contribute to the defense mechanisms of the plant and how it could do it, are two questions which may be addressed. Some of the studies carried out in the course of the present work have also outlined the exceptional resistance of PQC to denaturation. The fold pattern of the native enzyme seems to be maintained intact

under a variety of experimental conditions (pH range: 4^9; temperature range: 25^90³C; Gu-HCl concentration range: 0^4 M). It was even observed that some residual native-like structure of PQC still persists even in the presence of 7 M Gu-HCl at neutral pH. It can be interesting to put together the exceptional resistance of PQC to these arti¢cial denaturing conditions with the unusual physicochemical properties of the physiological milieu from which the enzyme was puri¢ed. One should indeed realize that the papaya laticifers may be regarded as a bu¡ered (pH of about 5.2) aqueous solution containing 1 mM fully active cysteine proteinases and 20 mM low molecular weight free thiol compounds. These values are calculated on the basis of results of titrations with methylmethanethiolsulfonate and 2-PDS as well as of measurements of catalytic activities performed when collecting fresh papaya latex. One can calculate that, as a mean, for each molecule of PQC in the plant latex there are not less than 100 molecules of proteinases. Glycyl endopeptidase speci¢cally cleaves peptide bonds adjacent to glycine residues [47]. In contrast, papain, chymopapain and caricain are unspeci¢c proteinases capable of cleaving a great variety of peptide bonds [10]. Few polypeptide chains would resist to such a detrimental environment. Some of the results reported here support the idea that PQC does successfully resist proteolysis by the papaya proteinases. The highly puri¢ed molecular species of PQC obtained here was unambiguously shown to be constituted by a unique polypeptide chain. Moreover, examination of the PQC activity elution pro¢le on the various chromatographic supports used to purify the plant enzyme, showed that microheterogeneity was quite limited. Microheterogeneity of PQC was ¢rst revealed by the presence of a shoulder on the left side of the enzyme peak in the course of ion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 1). Also, some 20% of the total PQC activity loaded on the hydrophobic interaction chromatographic support was not co-eluted with the PQC peak but was rather shared among several of the other peaks visible in Fig. 2. The origin of the observed microheterogeneity is not known but if it is a result of the presence of nicked forms of PQC, altogether these forms probably constitute a minor fraction. This conclusion should be regarded as preliminary since

it is based upon the results of PQC activity measurements which, unfortunately, may preclude to display inactivated nicked forms of the enzyme. The use of antibodies directed against the highly puri¢ed PQC obtained here should be helpful to further investigate this point. Also, work is in progress in our laboratory to obtain more direct evidence that indeed PQC successfully resists proteolysis. Anticipating the publication of these results, it is expected from the work of Fontana and co-workers ([48] and Refs. therein) that a compact 3-D structure with short rigid loops constitutes elements which favor resistance to nicking. Such elements should also favor high resistance to denaturation as observed here. In this respect, PQC seems to even outline the other papaya enzymes. We indeed noted melting temperatures, at pH 3.9, of 80.3, 85.2, 86.2 and 89.2³C for glycyl endopeptidase, papain, caricain and chymopapain, respectively [49]. We also noted that conformational transitions were observed in Gu-HCl concentration ranges of 2^4 and 4.5^5.5 M for papain [50] and papaya class II chitinase [45] respectively.
