METHODS

Interproton distances were computed as a function of the torsion angles for a pair of linked peptide units in the standard trans geometry having Pauling-Corey dimensions (8). The interresidue distan=H * . .Ni+lH is a function of $, while the intraresidue distance N.H. * *@H * function of @. The N.H***N.

Superposition of these plots on the Ramachandran steric map (10) permits partitioning of the allowed regions of conformational space into zones characterized by specific short interproton distances. Experimental NOE results summarized in Table 1 were determined on a Bruker WH-270 MHz NMR spectrometer as described earlier (11). Details of peptide synthesis and characterisation will be published separately.
