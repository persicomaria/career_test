Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) from Xanthomonas campestris is a highly specific hemecontaining enzyme from a small family of homologous enzymes, which includes indoleamine 2,3dioxygenase (IDO). The structure of wild type (WT TDO) in the catalytically active, ferrous (Fe2+) form and in complex with its substrate L-tryptophan (L-Trp) was recently reported [Forouhar et al. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 473-478] and revealed that histidine 55 hydrogen bonds to L-Trp, precisely positioning it in the active site and implicating it as a possible active site base. In this study the substitution of the active site residue histidine 55 by alanine and serine (H55A and H55S) provides insight into the molecular mechanism used by the enzyme to control substrate binding. We report the crystal structure of the H55A and H55S mutant forms at 2.15 and 1.90 Å resolution, respectively, in binary complexes with L-Trp. These structural data, in conjunction with potentiometric and kinetic studies on both mutants, reveal that histidine 55 is not essential for turnover but greatly disfavors the mechanistically unproductive binding of L-Trp to the oxidized enzyme allowing control of catalysis. This is demonstrated by the difference in the Kd values for L-Trp binding to the two oxidation states of wild-type TDO (3.8 mM oxidized, 4.1 µM reduced), H55A TDO (11.8 µM oxidized, 3.7 µM reduced), and H55S TDO (18.4 µM oxidized, 5.3 µM reduced).
Oxidative cleavage of the L-tryptophan (L-Trp)1 pyrrole ring and the insertion of molecular oxygen to produce N-formylkynurenine is the first and rate-limiting step in the kynurenine pathway and is catalyzed by tryptophan 2,3dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (2, 3). The kynurenine pathway processes 95% of L-Trp utilized by humans, leading ultimately to the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential coenzyme (4). Kynurenine pathway metabolites have been implicated in a number of diseases ranging from neurological disorders, such as cerebral malaria and multiple sclerosis, to cataract formation (5, 6). Recent findings have implicated tryptophan catabolism via the kynurenine pathway in immune tolerance, including immune suppression in maternal fetal tolerance and the immune escape of cancers (7-10).
 The atomic coordinates for H55A and H55S mutant enzymes of TDO have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, entries 3BK9 and 3E08, respectively. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

ABSTRACT:

These properties make elucidation of the precise catalytic mechanism of these enzymes extremely important. TDO and IDO belong to a little-characterized family of dioxygenases that occurs in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (11). These enzymes have homologous 3-D structures but dissimilar primary structures, with sequence identity often less than 10% between family members (12). First identified in 1936 (13), TDO is mainly found in the liver of mammals but has also been recently identified in mammalian mucous membranes, epididymis, and brain (14, 15). The enzyme discussed here is a prokaryotic TDO from Xanthomonas campestris (the causative agent of black rot in cabbages), which shares 34% sequence identity with human TDO. The enzyme is a homotetramer that displays high substrate specificity, catalyzing the oxidation of L-Trp, 5-F-Trp, and 6-F-Trp (1). In contrast, IDO is found throughout the body in mammals, except for in the liver, and no prokaryotic IDO protein has yet been identified. IDO is monomeric and catalyzes the dioxygenation of L-Trp, D-Trp, serotonin, tryptamine, and 5-OH-Trp, displaying less substrate specificity than TDO (11, 16). The crystal structures of WT X. campestris TDO (1, 17) and human IDO (12) have been published recently, revealing similarities between the two enzymes and allowing the identification of potentially important active site residues. The catalytic mechanisms employed by TDO and IDO have, as yet, not been elucidated, but two proposed mechanisms for tryptophan dioxygenation are shown in Figure 1.

structure of the H55A mutant to 2.15 Å resolution and the crystal structure of the H55S mutant to 1.90 Å resolution and relate these to electrochemical and kinetic data for the mutant enzymes. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Genetic Manipulation, Protein Expression, and Purification. Full-length X. campestris TDO (NESG (Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium) ID XcR13) was cloned into a pET21d (Novagen, San Diego, CA) derivative with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag and overexpressed at 17 °C in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pMGK cells. Point mutations H55A and H55S were created by employing the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers directing mutations were designed in an automated fashion by using the Primer Prim'er program, accessible at www-nmr.cabm.rutgers.edu/bioinformatics/Primer_Primer/. The mutations and their associated ORF were verified by DNA sequence analysis (1). WT TDO and its mutant forms were purified using nickelaffinity and gel-filtration chromatography. Protein and heme concentrations were determined by the Bradford and pyridine hemochrome methods, respectively (18, 19). For WT TDO extinction coefficients 404nm and 431nm of 180.5 ((0.1) mM-1 cm-1 and 113.0 ((0.1) mM-1 cm-1 per protomer were calculated for the ferric and ferrous enzymes, respectively (1). For the H55A mutant enzyme extinction coefficients 405nm and 431nm were 130.4 ((0.3) mM-1 cm-1 and 120.0 ((0.1) mM-1 cm-1 per protomer. For the H55S mutant extinction coefficients 405nm and 431nm were 132.0 ((0.3) mM-1 cm-1 and 116.0 ((0.2) mM-1 cm-1 per protomer. Protein Crystallization and Data Collection. Crystallization of H55A and H55S TDO was carried out by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C in Linbro plates. Crystals were obtained with well solutions comprising 9-10% (w/v) PEG 1000, 80 mM MES buffer, pH 6.3, 20 mM bicine buffer, pH 9.0, 40 mM MnCl2, 400 mM MgCl2, 8-15 mM NaCN, and 20 mM L-Trp. Hanging drops (4 µL volume) were prepared by adding 2 µL of 8 mg mL-1 protein (in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mM in EDTA) to 2 µL of well solution. Red tetragonal shaped crystals appeared after approximately 1 week, reaching full size after 2 weeks. Crystals were immersed in mineral oil prior to being mounted in nylon loops and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. For crystals of both H55A and H55S enzymes, data sets were collected to a resolution of 2.15 and 1.90 Å, respectively, at station

FIGURE 1: Catalytic mechanism proposed for L-tryptophan dioxygenation by TDO. The figure displays an ionic, base-catalyzed mechanism of L-Trp dioxygenation. The first substrate binds to the protein (1), followed by dioxygen binding to form the ternary complex (2). The mechanism proceeds by the formation of a hydroperoxide intermediate (3 and 6), which can undergo two different rearrangements to form the product, N-formylkynurenine (8), a Criegee rearrangement (4 and 5), or a dioxetane rearrangement (7). The product is then released leaving the protein in the active ferrous state.

It is proposed that the catalytic mechanism involves the basecatalyzed deprotonation of the indole nitrogen of the substrate. However, the structures of TDO and IDO show that while TDO contains a histidine residue in its active site, IDO does not contain any residues in its active site capable of performing base-catalyzed deprotonation. Instead, it has been proposed that proton abstraction is facilitated by a bound dioxygen molecule (Figure 2). In the TDO active site histidine 55 hydrogen bonds to L-Trp and is implicated as the active site base. In this study we attempt to resolve the question of whether an active site base is necessary for catalytic activity in TDO. To accomplish this, histidine is replaced by alanine or serine (H55A and H55S mutants of TDO). These substitutions were chosen due to the inability of alanine to act as an active site base and the presence in IDO of a serine residue in the analogous position to histidine 55. We report the crystal

Data processing was carried out using the CCP4 package (20) and PHENIX (21). The wild-type TDO apoenzyme structure (PDB ID 1YW0), stripped of water, was used as the initial model. Electron density fitting was carried out using PHENIX and Turbofrodo (22), and structure refinement was carried out using PHENIX and Refmac (23). Steady-State Kinetic Analysis and Binding Constant Assays. UV-visible spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a Cary 50-Probe UV-visible spectrophotometer. Steady-state turnover assays (at pH 7.5) for oxidation of L-Trp and fluorinated derivatives were performed as described by Ishimura (24), except that substrate concentrations of up to 15 mM L-Trp were used. The rate of formation of Nformylkynurenine was monitored by measuring the change in absorbance at 321 nm ( 321(N-formylkynurenine) ) 3750 M-1 cm-1). Kinetic data were fitted to the Hill equation using Origin software (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding to ferric and ferrous WT TDO and mutant enzymes were determined by established procedures in a Belle Technology anaerobic glovebox with [O2] maintained below 5 ppm. The electronic absorption spectra at the steady state were recorded by using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SX.17MV; Applied-Photophysics, Surrey, U.K.) in conjunction with a diode array detector, housed in an anaerobic glovebox. The oxygen binding affinity (Km) was measured by standard methods by adding varying concentrations of O2 (e1 mM) to the L-Trp saturated (25 mM) assay and by calculating the steady-state parameters as described above. Oxygen concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by titrating aliquots of oxygenated buffer into a solution of electrochemically reduced methyl viologen. The subsequent change in absorbance at 540 nm ( 540(methyl viologen) ) 13000 M-1 cm-1) due to reduction of molecular oxygen was used to calculate [O2] (1). OTTLE Electrochemistry. Anaerobic potentiometric titrations on WT TDO and mutant enzymes were carried out as previously described (1, 25) at 25 °C using a modified quartz EPR OTTLE cell, with the exception that 100 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 300 mM KCl (with or without 10% glycerol) buffer was used. A range of mediators were added (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (-145 mV vs SHE), 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (-3 mV), phenazine ethosulfate (+55 mV), phenazine methosulfate (+82 mV), and 1,2naphthoquinone (+135 mV)) to ensure efficient reduction and reoxidation of the protein. Titrations were performed in both the absence and presence of substrate for WT TDO (15 mM L-Trp), the H55A mutant (5 mM L-Trp), and the H55S mutant (10 mM L-Trp). Heme reduction potentials were determined by fitting the data to a Nernst equation for a single-electron process using Origin software. Reduction potentials are quoted versus the standard hydrogen electrode. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystal Structures of H55A and H55S TDO.

to the much greater affinity of L-Trp for the oxidized mutant enzymes compared to WT TDO (see below and Table 3). For H55A TDO a data set to 2.15 Å resolution was used to refine the structure to a final R-factor of 20.5% (Rfree ) 28.5%), while for H55S TDO data to a resolution of 1.90 Å were used to refine the structure to a final R-factor of 17.8% (Rfree ) 21.6%). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. For each of the H55A and H55S mutant enzymes the final model consists of two TDO tetramers (1 and 2), one of which (tetramer 1) is better defined than the other in the electron density map. The quality of the final electron density map around the active site of chain A of tetramer 1 of both mutant enzymes is shown in Figure 3. In both mutant enzymes each monomer also binds one heme group and one substrate molecule. Further to this, a

Thackray et al. is too far (g2.7 Å) from the heme iron to be a ligand. Further to this, an additional water molecule is found in the active site of the H55A and H55S mutant enzymes (water B in Figure 5) in a position which would be sterically inhibited by the histidine 55 side chain in WT TDO. In the H55A mutant enzyme water B is H-bonded to the substrate indole nitrogen (Figure 5a), but in the H55S model water B is instead H-bonded to the side-chain hydroxyl group of serine 55 (Figure 5b), too far away (3.4 Å) from L-Trp to maintain a hydrogen-bonding interaction. In WT TDO the histidine 55 imidazole moiety H-bonds to a water molecule in the substrate-free ferrous state, which is displaced upon binding of substrate. The removal of the histidine side chain in either mutant enzyme would almost certainly result in the absence of a water molecule in such a position. Steady-State Kinetics and Substrate/Substrate Analogue Binding. It has been previously reported that WT TDO shows catalytic activity toward L-Trp, 6-F-Trp, and 5-F-Trp. We have also observed activity toward 5-methyl-DL-tryptophan and 6-methyl-DL-tryptophan. H55A and H55S mutant enzymes show catalytic activity toward L-Trp, 6-F-Trp, 5-FTrp, 5-methyl-DL-tryptophan, and 6-methyl-DL-tryptophan but no activity with any other compounds investigated. Kinetic parameters are shown in Table 2, and there is about a 7-fold decrease in kcat values, compared to WT TDO, for both mutant enzymes. As previously reported, there is no inhibition of WT TDO catalytic activity on addition of 1-Me-DLtryptophan, and the same result is obtained for the mutant enzymes (1). This contrasts with findings on IDO, where 1-Me-DL-tryptophan is a known inhibitor of L-Trp dioxygenation activity (11). Catalytic activity is observed only by the ferrous enzyme for both WT TDO and its mutant forms, in contrast to recent findings that show catalytic activity by ferric human TDO. The substitution of histidine 55 may have been expected to render the enzyme inactive if a base is required in the catalytic cycle, but the possibility that a water molecule could be bound, in the vacant space made by the substitution of histidine 55, must be considered. This water molecule could, possibly, act as an active site base dependent on its pKa in the active site. A water molecule is found near this position in both of the mutant enzymes, but it is not optimally aligned for the deprotonation of L-Trp. It is also located 3.3 Å away from the indole nitrogen atom, outside the range of a normal H-bonding interactions, and we propose that it plays no role in the catalytic cycle (Figure 1). These data, and the relative insensitivity of the WT TDO kcat to pH (Supporting Information Table 1), support the idea that histidine 55 or a solvent molecule is not required to deprotonate the indole nitrogen atom. In IDO where the active site is devoid of solvent, the equivalent residue to histidine 55 is serine 167, which is incapable of acting as a catalytic base. Turnover still occurs, and like TDO kcat is observed to be insensitive to pH (26). The decrease in kcat for L-Trp oxidation in both the H55A and H55S mutants may be explained by the movement of L-Trp in the active site. It can be seen from the crystal structures that for both mutants L-Trp has rotated toward the substituted amino acid (and away from the iron atom) relative to the position of L-Trp in WT TDO. The L-Trp indole ring has also shifted toward the heme (shown in Figure 4). These movements are accompanied by a slight increase in the

The L-Trp from the H55A and H55S enzymes (in green and orange, respectively) are rotated toward alanine/serine 55 and the heme, relative to the position of the substrate in WT TDO (yellow). The H-bond between histidine 55 and the substrate is lost as a result of the substitution by alanine/ serine. The position of the water molecule (water A; see Figure 5) above the heme group in H55A and H55S TDOs is slightly different than in WT enzyme due to the altered substrate binding. This figure was generated using PYMOL (30).

second L-Trp molecule is observed at the intersubunit interface close to each of chains A, B, C, D, and E in the H55A TDO structure, and in the H55S model there is one interfacial L-Trp per monomer. In addition, the H55A and H55S models contain 1026 and 1955 water molecules, respectively. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, accession codes 3BK9 (H55A) and 3E08 (H55S). Binding Mode of L-Trp to H55A and H55S Mutants. The binding orientation of L-Trp at the active site of the H55A mutant enzyme is slightly different from that observed in the WT TDO structure. An overlay of the active sites of WT TDO and the H55A and H55S enzymes (based on R-C overlay) is shown in Figure 4. The bound L-Trp substrates belonging to the H55A and H55S mutant enzymes (in green and orange, respectively) are shifted toward the side chain of residue 55 relative to the position of L-Trp in the wildtype enzyme (in yellow). Due to the substitution of histidine 55 by alanine or serine the hydrogen-bonding interaction between residue 55 and the substrate indole nitrogen atom is lost. The remaining interactions between the substrate and active site residues that are observed in the wild-type enzyme are maintained in both mutant enzymes (Figure 5). The active sites of WT TDO and both of the H55A and H55S mutant enzymes contain a water molecule above the distal face of the heme (water A in Figure 5). In all three enzymes this water is H-bonded to the ammonium group of L-Trp and the main-chain amide nitrogen of glycine 125 but

substrate Km values, implying a small decrease in the stability of the Michaelis complex. The rotation has resulted in the displacement of the tryptophan indole ring from the dioxygen binding site, thus decreasing overlap of the molecular orbitals involved in catalysis. The transition state for the reaction will be less stable, thus increasing the activation energy for catalysis. This will decrease the turnover rates for both mutants compared to WT TDO. In WT TDO there is a large increase in the affinity of the enzyme for L-Trp for ferrous vs ferric enzyme (Kd(Fe3+) ) 3.8 mM, Kd(Fe2+) ) 4.1 µM) (Table 3). This is in contrast to recent findings for human TDO, where there was found to be little discrimination of binding between the ferric and the ferrous enzymes (27). For both mutant proteins this effect is essentially destroyed, with only a small increase shown in the affinity of the ferrous enzyme for L-Trp relative to ferric (Table 3). This trend in Kd is repeated for other substrates. These findings suggest that one role of histidine 55 is to disfavor substrate binding to the oxidized protein, and its removal increases binding affinity by a factor >300. It can therefore be hypothesized that histidine 55 is responsible for controlling the binding affinity of the active site for L-Trp, effectively gating the binding of substrate to WT TDO. In this way histidine 55 greatly disfavors the mechanistically unproductive binding of L-Trp to the oxidized enzyme, promoting the productive binding of L-Trp to the reduced enzyme. Electrochemical Studies. Electrochemical data for WT TDO and the H55A mutant are shown in Figure 6, and the measured midpoint potentials are displayed in Table 4. There is a much smaller shift in the reduction potential upon binding of substrate (Emid H55A ) +23 mV) (Emid H55S ) +57 mV) for the mutant enzymes compared to WT TDO (Emid WT ) +136 mV). The shift in reduction potential of 23 mV for the H55A mutant enzyme almost perfectly correlates with the increase in affinity for L-Trp for the ferrous vs the ferric form (Kd (Fe(II)) ) 3.7 µM vs Kd (Fe(III)) ) 11.8 µM), both giving an estimated G of 3.5 kJ mol-1. In fact, the difference in these G values calculated for WT TDO and the H55A mutant enzyme is

The increase in affinity for L-Trp to the ferrous H55S vs the ferric give an estimated G of 5.5 kJ mol-1. It is possible that the lower affinity of oxidized WT TDO for substrate may be attributed to subtle changes in the structure of the active site (in terms of the hydrogen-bonding pattern) between the oxidized and reduced enzymes.

FIGURE 8: Production of the wild-type TDO oxyferrous ternary complex. The peak positions of the oxyferrous ternary complex are at 420, 548, and 578 nm. This decays back to ferrous enzyme and product (N-formylkynurenine, peak position 321 nm).

FIGURE 7: Plot of the observed steady-state turnover rate (kapp) versus O2 concentration for wild-type TDO (top) and H55A (middle) and H55S (bottom) mutant forms. The maximum turnover rate (kmax), the Michaelis constant (Km), and the inhibition constant (Ki (for oxygen)) are reported.

accompanies expulsion of solvent from the active site and results in the formation of a hydrogen bond between histidine 55 and the pyrrole nitrogen of the indole L-Trp moiety. In the H55A mutant enzyme the alanine side chain is unable to form the same hydrogen bonds that histidine 55 can in WT TDO. Consequently, there may be less rearrangement of the active site hydrogen-bonding interactions necessary to allow L-Trp binding, and the Kd for substrate binding to ferric enzyme is correspondingly low. All other amino acid interactions binding L-Trp to the active site are analogous to WT TDO. Consequently, the absence of significant oxidation-state-dependent changes in the active site in H55A TDO results in decreased specificity of binding to the oxidized or reduced enzyme. The case is similar for the H55S mutant enzyme as the serine side chain is unable to form the same hydrogen bonds that histidine 55 can in WT TDO. It is possible that the serine could form a bonding interaction with a nearby solvent molecule (water 250), but the data suggest that less rearrangement of active site hydrogen-bonding interactions is necessary to allow L-Trp binding than for WT TDO. Stability of the Michaelis Complex. Figure 7 shows how the observed rate constant for turnover (kapp) is dependent

on dioxygen concentration, [O2], under saturating L-Trp concentrations (25 mM). In phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 25 °C, Km(O2) is approximately 120 µM and kapp for WT TDO is only 60% of maximum; however, in the case of the H55A and H55S mutant enzymes, kapp is nearly maximal (Table 2). These data seem contrary to the Michaelis model (based on steady-state kinetics) that predicts a lower O2 binding affinity for the mutant forms. WT TDO has an ordered catalytic cycle in which the reduced enzyme-substrate complex must be formed prior to O2 binding for turnover to occur (11, 28). No ferrous-oxy complex is observed, and addition of oxygen to ferrous WT TDO or the mutant forms in the absence of substrate leads to direct decay to the ferric state. This is also the case for human TDO (27), suggesting that instability of the ferrous-oxy species may be common in TDO species. The similar L-Trp binding affinity of the reduced mutant enzymes compared to WT TDO (3.7 and 5.2 µM versus 4.1 µM) and similar Km values for substrates (Table 2) show that all enzymes can bind substrate and then dioxygen in productive ternary complex formation. Structural data indicate that movement of the indole moiety of L-Trp in the active site is responsible for the decrease in kcat for H55A and H55S. The increased L-Trp binding affinity to the oxidized H55A and H55S enzymes, compared to WT TDO, will lead to a higher probability of nonproductive oxidized enzyme-substrate complex formation, possibly decreasing kcat, but this effect would be small compared to the effect of the destabilized transition state. Formation and decay of the oxyferrous ternary species generated (Figure 8) for WT TDO show that the (Fe2+-L-Trp) complex displaying a Soret peak at 432 nm binds O2, producing (Fe2+-L-Trp-O2), with a corresponding shift in the Soret peak to 419 nm. This then decays to N-formylkynurenine (shown by an increase in absorbance at 321 nm) and ferrous enzyme (displaying a Soret peak at 432 nm). This is also observed with 6-F-Trp as the substrate, but for 5-F-Trp some uncoupling is seen, leading to production of the inactive ferric enzyme and the superoxide anion (O2-) and release of the substrate. These trends are repeated for H55A and H55S, with uncoupling observed only with 5-F-Trp as substrate. However, the initial

rates of formation of the ternary complexes are slower, with a rate constant of approximately 50 s-1 compared to 100 s-1 for WT TDO. Oxyferrous decay parallels this with rate constants of 0.4 s-1 and 2 s-1 for the mutant enzymes and WT TDO, respectively. This indicates that both mutations do not destabilize the ternary complex significantly, but as the rate of decay is decreased compared to WT TDO, this correlates with a higher activation energy for catalysis due to the movement of the tryptophan indole ring destabilizing the catalytic transition state. Substrate inhibition is observed at high oxygen concentrations for both mutant forms (Table 5), while none is observed for WT TDO. This unexpected result may be plausibly explained by the lower rate of decay and subsequent slower expulsion of product from the active site by the mutant enzymes. As the active site cavity is larger due to the removal of histidine and its replacement by alanine or serine in the mutant forms, the product, N-formylkynurenine, may be less readily expelled at high oxygen concentrations and dioxygen may be able to bind before the product has left. This would trap the product in the active site, causing inhibition of catalytic activity. CONCLUSIONS In this study we have investigated whether a putative active site base, histidine 55, is necessary for catalytic activity in TDO. The data we have presented show that in the mutant enzymes H55A and H55S turnover still occurs. This indicates clearly that histidine 55 is not an essential base. Instead, a different role for histidine 55 in controlling substrate binding at the active site has been revealed. On the basis of structural, kinetic, and electrochemical data we have proposed that the role of histidine 55 is to prevent the formation of the nonproductive ferric enzyme-substrate complex. This is most likely achieved by histidine 55 controlling the water content of the substrate-free active site.
