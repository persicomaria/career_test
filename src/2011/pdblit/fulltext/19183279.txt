Introduction
Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium that causes a range of gastrointestinal diseases, collectively referred to as C. difficileassociated disease (CDAD) (Poxton et al., 2001; Bartlett, 2007). The incidence of CDAD in North America and in Europe has increased dramatically in recent years, and C. difficile is now the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhoea (Kuipers and Surawicz, 2008). Infections are most commonly seen in the hospital setting and are often associated with previous or ongoing antibiotic therapy. Bacterial spores are the infectious agent and, once in the intestine, germinate to form vegetative cells that produce two major toxins, TcdA and TcdB (von Eichel-Streiber et al., 1996). These toxins are internalized into epithelial cells where they inhibit small-molecular-weight G proteins, resulting in disruption of the cytoskeleton, apoptosis and cell death (Just and Gerhard, 2004). Toxin action results in recruitment of neutrophils to the underlying intestinal lamina propria, resulting in a severe inflammation of the tissue. A wide variety of C. difficile strains are implicated in human disease (Brazier et al., 2007), including `hypervirulent' strains, termed NAP/1 or ribotype 027, which have been associated with increasing morbidity and mortality (Loo et al., 2005; McDonald et al., 2005). Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by C. difficile is essential to pathogenesis, but our knowledge of this process and of the bacterial factors involved is rudimentary. Apart from the toxins, a small number of putative virulence determinants of the bacterium have been identified, including adhesins, flagella and heat shock proteins (Hennequin et al., 2001; Tasteyre et al., 2001; Waligora et al., 2001), but details of their precise roles in infection are unclear. One structure that has been implicated in adhesion of C. difficile to enteric cells is the bacterial S-layer (surface layer), a proteinaceous twodimensional paracrystalline array that completely surrounds the vegetative cell. Several functions have been proposed for bacterial S-layers including acting as molecular sieves, protective factors against parasitic attack, virulence factors and adhesion sites for extracellular proteins (Sara and Sleytr, 2000). S-layers are a highly diverse family of proteins with little or no sequence identity between S-layer proteins (SLPs) from distinct

Summary
Clostridium difficile expresses a surface layer (S-layer) which coats the surface of the bacterium and acts as an adhesin facilitating interaction of the bacterium with host enteric cells. The S-layer contains a high-molecular-weight S-layer protein (HMW SLP) and its low-molecular-weight partner protein (LMW SLP). We show that these proteins form a tightly associated non-covalent complex, the H/L complex, and we identify the regions of both proteins responsible for complex formation. The 2.4 Å X-ray crystal structure of a truncated derivative of the LMW SLP reveals two domains. Domain 1 has a two-layer sandwich architecture while domain 2, predicted to orientate towards the external environment, contains a novel fold. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of the H/L complex shows an elongated molecule, with the two SLPs arranged `end-to-end' interacting with each other through a small contact area. Alignment of LMW SLPs, which exhibit high sequence diversity, reveals a core of conserved residues that could reflect functional conservation, while allowing for immune evasion through sequence variation. These structures are the first described for the S-layer of a bacterial pathogen, and provide insights into the assembly and biogenesis of the S-layer.

Fig. 1. Model of the cell wall of C. difficile.
A. The two SLPs are shown above the peptidoglycan layer: the HMW SLP (light grey), the LMW SLP (dark grey). Other minor cell wall proteins are shown as two-lobed structures (white); the filled areas, indicating domains predicted to be exposed to the environment, are variable between these proteins. Putative cell wall polymers (Ganeshapillai et al., 2008) including putative lipid-containing polymers (Poxton and Cartmill, 1982) are shown as vertical black bars. B.

species (Sara, 2001). Purified SLPs frequently retain the ability to form regular two-dimensional arrays in suspension and on a variety of solid supports including liposomes and lipid monolayers (Sara and Sleytr, 2000). Some but not all SLPs contain a conserved sequence, the S-layer homology (SLH) motif, that mediates binding to pyruvylated cell wall components (Mesnage et al., 2000; Sara, 2001). The C. difficile SLPs do not contain such SLH motifs (Calabi et al., 2001), neither are they glycosylated (Qazi et al., 2008). In C. difficile the S-layer is composed of two SLPs which are derived from post-translational cleavage of a single precursor, SlpA. The SlpA pre-protein contains a signal peptide directing translocation across the cell membrane, after which cleavage occurs producing the mature SLPs (Calabi et al., 2001; Karjalainen et al., 2002) (Fig. 1). The mature SLPs are a high-molecular-weight protein (~40 kDa, HMW SLP) and a low-molecular-weight protein (~35 kDa, LMW SLP) (Calabi et al., 2001). The SLPs facilitate adhesion to cultured cell lines, and the LMW and HMW SLPs adhere to ex vivo human gastrointestinal tissues (Calabi et al., 2002). The LMW SLP is an immunodominant antigen, and antibodies against this protein are found in sera from individuals who have had CDAD (Pantosti et al., 1989). Extensive sequence variation is seen in the SLPs between different C. difficile strains, particularly in the LMW SLP which may lie external to the HMW SLP on the bacterial cell surface (Calabi and Fairweather, 2002; Karjalainen et al., 2002). This sequence variation is reflected in limited immunological cross-reactivity between the LMW SLPs from different strains (Calabi et al., 2001). In contrast, the HMW SLP sequences, which show no sequence identity to the LMW SLPs, are highly conserved between strains and are immunologically cross-reactive. In this study we have

determined the crystal structure of a truncated mutant of the LMW SLP from C. difficile CD630 and describe how this protein associates with the HMW SLP to form a stable complex that is an inherent part of the S-layer of this organism.

Results
The SLPs from C. difficile form a stable complex S-layer extracts were prepared from C. difficile strain CD630 (Sebaihia et al., 2006) by treatment with low-pH glycine, which releases the SLPs from the cell wall, and analysed by denaturing and native PAGE (Fig. 2A). Two major bands are seen on SDS-PAGE, representing the LMW and HMW SLPs. In contrast, only one band is seen on native gels, and immunoblotting with anti-HMW SLP and anti-LMW SLP antibodies confirmed that this single band is composed of both SLPs. The two SLPs therefore co-purify from C. difficile as a single high-molecular-mass species, which we term the H/L complex. Recombinant forms of the CD630 LMW and HMW SLPs, containing C-terminal His-tags, were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. These proteins, when mixed in an equimolar ratio, also formed the H/L complex indicating that no additional C. difficile proteins are necessary for formation of the H/L complex. Size-exclusion chromatography of a low-pH glycine extract from CD630 gave one major peak (Fig. 2B), eluting at an apparent molecular mass of 320 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein fractions contained in this peak demonstrated the presence of predominantly the two SLPs. These experiments show that the H/L complex is formed by non-covalent interactions between the two SLPs and, after extraction from the cell wall of C. difficile, the complex remains as a stable species.

Crystal structure of the LMW SLP The mature LMW SLP (i.e. without its signal peptide) from strain CD630 (321 residues, 34.2 kDa) was expressed and purified from E. coli, but despite repeated attempts crystals were not obtained. Upon prolonged storage of the LMW SLP at room temperature, degradation was observed and a stable truncated form of the protein was obtained. Analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry revealed a mass consistent with the loss of the C-terminal 63 residues. A recombinant form of this truncated protein (LMW SLP1-262), lacking the C-terminal 59 residues, was constructed and expressed in E. coli. This protein readily formed crystals with a P64 space group with four molecules in the asymmetric unit and we determined its crystal structure to a resolution of 2.4 Å (Table 1). Experimental phases were obtained by the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method, using a seleno-methione (SeMet)-substituted version of the protein. The crystal structure obtained reveals a novel protein fold comprised of two domains (Fig. 3). The larger domain (domain 2), containing residues 89­238, is composed of ~10% a-helices, ~30% b-strands and ~60% loops. The main structural motifs present are: (i) two b-hairpins (hairpins 2 and 3, containing residues 150­170 and 211­227 respectively) of different loop lengths connecting each

pair of strands (hairpins 2 and 3 contain 11 and 5 residues forming each loop respectively), and (ii) one long a-helix containing residues 97­111. In addition to the two hairpins and the a-helix, domain 2 displays an intricate sequence of loops and b-turns, closely packed throughout with hydrogen-bonding interactions and intercalated with four very short b-strands (three residues long), which are paired forming two anti-parallel b-sheets. Domain 1, containing residues 1­88 and 239­249, displays a two-layer sandwich architecture [based on CATH Protein Structure Classification (Pearl et al., 2005)] and consists of ~37% a-helices, ~36% b-strands and ~27% loops (Fig. 3). One layer of the sandwich is composed of a five-stranded mixed b-sheet which provides the platform to support a pair of a-helices in the second layer. Domain 1 contains both the N- and C-termini of the protein (Fig. 3B). The first residue located at the N-terminus, and the last 24 residues including an eight-residue His-tag located at the C-terminus are unstructured due to unresolved electron density. This is the first reported crystal structure of an SLP from a bacterial pathogen; the only previously described structures are of two domains of the Archaeon Methanosarcina mazei SLP (Jing et al., 2002) and a domain of the SLP SbsC from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (Pavkov et al., 2008). Neither structure shows any similarity to that of the C. difficile SLP.

Identification of the domains of the LMW and HMW SLPs essential for formation of the H/L complex Interactions between the LMW and HMW SLPs were studied further. Using an ELISA where the HMW SLP was immobilized, the LMW SLP bound with a KD of 9.7 0.59 nM. In contrast the LMW SLP1-262, generated for crystallographic studies, was unable to interact with the HMW SLP to form the H/L complex as determined by both ELISA and native gel analysis (data not shown). We then constructed a series of deletion derivatives of the LMW SLP, and assessed by ELISA the ability of these proteins to bind to recombinant HMW SLP. Deletion of residues 1­159 or 160­210 of the LMW SLP did not significantly reduce the binding affinity for the HMW SLP, with respective KD values of 11.2 and 9.7 nM (Fig. 4A and B), whereas deletion of residues 160­321 abolished binding. Deletion of 211­259 reduced affinity compared with the full-length LMW SLP (KD of 37.5 nM) and deletion of residues 260­321 completely abolished binding. These results demonstrate an absolute requirement for the C-terminal 62 residues (260­321) of the LMW SLP for formation of the H/L complex.

In an analogous series of experiments, deletions were constructed in the HMW SLP. This was a more challenging experiment as the HMW SLP was found to degrade extensively when produced in E. coli. Purification using a His-tag produces multiple bands on SDS-PAGE, consistent with intracellular degradation of the protein. We solved this problem by purifying the insoluble form of the protein by denaturing affinity chromatography, followed by refolding by dialysis. The resulting HMW SLP retained the properties of native protein, i.e. it reacted with anti-HMW SLP antibodies and it formed the H/L complex with LMW SLP (Fig. 2A). In ELISA assays where the LMW SLP was immobilized on plates, the HMW SLP bound with a KD of 4.0 0.3 nM (Fig. 4D and E). Deletion of residues 158­ 374 of HMW SLP did not significantly affect the affinity of this protein for the LMW SLP (KD of 8.0 nM) whereas deletion of the N-terminal residues 1­156 completely abolished binding (Fig. 4D). Further analysis of the N-terminal region of the HMW SLP showed that residues 1­40 were essential for interaction with the LMW SLP, whereas deletion of residues 43­99 or 100­156 resulted in affinities similar to that of the full-length protein (KD values of 5.3 and 3.0 nM respectively; Fig. 4E).

the non-interacting truncated derivatives described above may be misfolded, the systematic deletion analysis undertaken here rules out an essential role for any other regions of the proteins in this interaction. Taken together these results show that the HMW and LMW SLPs interact via their N- and C-terminal regions respectively (Fig. 4G). Sequence conservation and variation in the LMW SLP Low-molecular-weight SLP sequences from six representative C. difficile strains were aligned (Fig. 5A). These strains are the reference strain CD630, a strain isolated in the USA in 2000 (CD101), three representatives of the most common ribotypes seen in UK hospitals (R20291, R8366 and NF2029) (Brazier et al., 2007), as well as strain R7404 (TcdA-ve, TcdB+ve) typical of those responsible for several epidemics throughout the world (Drudy et al., 2007). The majority of the LMW SLP is highly divergent, the sequence identity between any two strains being on average 32%. In contrast the C-terminal region of the protein, including the residues

present in full-length LMW SLP but absent in LMW SLP1-262, is strikingly conserved. This region contains two blocks of residues (245­274 and 304­321) which show high sequence identity (70­74%). This conserved region correlates with the residues shown to be essential for interaction with the HMW SLP (Fig. 4). The conserved residues were mapped onto the structure of the LMW SLP1-262 (Fig. 5B and C). The majority of the conserved residues are located towards the N-terminus in domain 1, which is proximal to the interaction domain. Most of these residues' side-chains are oriented towards the interior of the protein, probably contributing to the stability of this domain. The remaining conserved residues are in domain 2, and include a group of highly conserved residues which extends from the centre of the domain into a loop-rich region. This loop-rich region is located at the end of the H/L complex that is most likely to be exposed to the external environment of the C. difficile bacterium (see Discussion). The high content of loops within domain 2 may result in a structure that tolerates residue variability while retaining the overall fold.

Model of the interaction between the HMW SLP and LMW SLP. Arrowheads indicate the locations of the two cleavage events within SlpA which generate the mature SLPs; the first removes the signal sequence (SS) upon translocation across the membrane and the second separates the HMW SLP and LMW SLP. The SS is in black, the LMW SLP is dark grey and the HMW SLP is light grey. The locations of the PF04122 putative cell wall-binding Pfam motifs within the HMW SLP are indicated with hatched boxes.

Solution structures of the SLPs reveal an extended conformation In order to provide more structural information about the full-length LMW SLP and the H/L complex, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was employed. SAXS data were collected of the LMW SLP1-262, the full-length LMW SLP and the H/L complex (Table 2 and Fig. S1A). The distance distribution functions P(r) calculated from the data display skewed profiles typical for elongated particles (Fig. S1B).

The scattering pattern computed for the LMW SLP1-262 matches the experimental SAXS data with discrepancy c2 of 1.70. The crystal structure of the LMW SLP1-262 was successfully fitted into the low-resolution ab initio SAXS shapes of the LMW SLP1-262 (Fig. 6A and B) and of the full-length LMW SLP (Fig. 6C and D) determined by DAMMIN (Svergun, 1999). The rigid body exhaustive search docking, implemented in SITUS (Wriggers et al., 1999), shows a general agreement for the overall conformation of this molecule both in the crystal structure and in

solution. Furthermore, comparison of the full-length LMW SLP SAXS shape (145 Å ¥ 50 Å ¥ 33 Å) with the crystal and SAXS models of the LMW SLP1-262 reveals a protruding lobe, which is not present in the LMW SLP1-262. This

lobe most likely contains the C-terminal region (residues 263­321) that is essential for the interaction with the HMW SLP to form the H/L complex. The scattering volume of this lobe is ~2.8 ¥ 104 Å3, which corresponds to

350 Å3 per residue. This scattering-volume-per-residue value compares well with domain 1 and 2 values of 340 Å3 per residue and 277 Å3 per residue respectively. SAXS data were also obtained for the H/L complex (Fig. S1A) isolated from C. difficile CD630, and the determined molecular mass of the complex (Table 2) is consistent with a heterodimer of LMW SLP and HMW SLP molecules. These data, and the full-length LMW SLP data set, were used in MONSA (Svergun, 1999; Svergun and Nierhaus, 2000) to obtain an ab initio SAXS model of the H/L complex. Simultaneous fitting of two data sets allows one not only to reconstruct the overall shape but also to depict the LMW SLP and HMW SLP molecules (Fig. 7). The reconstructed shape displays an elongated, thin molecule with approximate dimensions 240 Å ¥ 105 Å ¥ 75 Å (Fig. 7). The elongated shape of the H/L complex may explain the aberrant mobility of this species (320 kDa) under size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2B). The two proteins are arranged in an `end-to-end' complex with the LMW and HMW SLPs interacting with each other via a contact area of c. 450 Å2, presumably between domains located in their C- and N-terminal regions respectively.

Discussion
In this study, we have solved the structure of the LMW SLP from C. difficile CD630, one of two components of the S-layer of this bacterium. This is the first crystal structure of an SLP from a bacterial pathogen to be determined and provides insight into the architecture of this class of protein. It has been suggested that difficulties in obtaining atomic resolution structures of SLPs in general lie in the propensity of these proteins to form two-dimensional arrays, hindering the formation of three-dimensional crystals (Sleytr et al., 2007). In the case of C. difficile, the H/L complex can form two-dimensional arrays in vitro in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Takumi et al., 1992). Our approach of crystallizing mutants deficient in S-layer H/L complex assembly appears to have overcome this problem, and may be broadly applicable to crystallization of this family of proteins. Like S-layers from other prokaryotes, these arrays can be formed either in liquid or on synthetic solid supports such as silicon or on cell wall components from the parent organism, e.g. peptidoglycan sacculi or secondary cell wall polymers (Sara, 2001).

Fig. 6. SAXS shapes of the full-length and truncated forms of the LMW SLP. A and B. Two orientations, differing by a 90° rotation, are shown of the SAXS shape of the LMW SLP1-262 with the crystal structure of the same molecule fitted by rigid body refinement (SITUS). C and D. Two orientations, differing by a 90° rotation, of the SAXS shape of the full-length LMW SLP with the crystal structure LMW SLP1-262 fitted by rigid body refinement (SITUS). The lobe in the full-length LMW SLP SAXS shape which is unoccupied by the LMW SLP1-262 crystal structure presumably includes the C-terminal 62 residues deleted from this molecule, which are essential for interaction between the full-length LMW SLP and the HMW SLP.

While the exact parameters which govern assembly of the complete S-layer of C. difficile are at present unknown, the conformation that the LMW SLP adopts in complex with the HMW SLP must either allow S-layer formation or contribute directly to its assembly. Deletion analysis of the LMW SLP demonstrated that the C-terminal 62 residues are necessary for interaction with the HMW SLP to form the H/L complex. The interaction domain is highly conserved in sequence between all 18 LMW SLP sequences determined to date (data not shown). The high degree of conservation of the LMW SLP C-terminal interaction domain in the context of the overall variability of the LMW SLP sequences suggests a common mechanism for the assembly of the H/L complex in C. difficile. In addition to the conserved interaction domain, the LMW SLP also shows a high degree of conservation in the signal peptide and in the N-terminal

region of the mature protein. The significance of the N-terminal conservation is discussed below in the context of the crystal structure. The crystal structure of the LMW SLP1-262 reveals two domains: domain 2 displays a novel protein fold not yet classified, and domain 1 adopts a two-layer sandwich architecture. Fitting of the SAXS structure of the fulllength LMW SLP with the crystal structure of the LMW SLP1-262 revealed that the full-length LMW SLP contains an additional lobe in the vicinity of its C-terminus. Taken together with the deletion analysis, these results indicate that this lobe contains the domain essential for the interaction with the HMW SLP to form the H/L complex. Furthermore, the low-resolution SAXS structure of the H/L complex shows the two SLPs in an `end-to-end' orientation, with a small interface between the HMW and LMW SLPs clearly visible. This is in complete agreement with

Fig. 7. SAXS structure of the native H/L complex isolated from C. difficile CD630. A and B. Two orientations, differing by a 90° rotation, are shown of the SAXS structure of the H/L complex. Structure modelling was carried out in MONSA, simultaneously fitting the H/L complex and full-length LMW SLP data sets. The white bead model represents the full-length LMW SLP and the red bead model the HMW SLP. C. Model of the orientation of the HMW and LMW SLPs on the surface of C. difficile. The SAXS structure of the H/L complex is shown as above with a ribbon representation of the LMW SLP1-262 crystal structure overlaid in blue. The HMW SLP is also shown interacting with the cell wall through one region of the protein; however, the extent and exact nature of this interaction is currently unknown.

the identification by mutagenesis of discrete interaction domains in both proteins. The overall shape of the H/L complex, the locations of the interaction domains and the overall sequence variability of the LMW SLP suggest a model for orientation of the S-layer on the cell surface. The HMW SLP contains

PF04122 Pfam `cell wall binding' motifs (Calabi et al., 2001; Karjalainen et al., 2001) that are predicted to mediate interactions with the underlying cell wall, perhaps by binding to peptidoglycan or teichoic acids (Herbold and Glaser, 1975). This implies that the HMW SLP is attached to the cell wall, acting as an anchor to display the LMW

SLP on the cell surface. The LMW SLP is then orientated such that its interaction domain is proximal to the HMW SLP with domains 1 and 2 oriented towards the external face of the S-layer. In this model, domain 2 of the LMW SLP is located at the extreme end of the H/L complex and therefore most likely to be exposed to the external environment (Fig. 7C). This is consistent with its high sequence variability and may reflect evolutionary pressure on the bacterium to avoid recognition by the immune system of the host or by phage. The SLPs are known to bind to surface components of enteric cells of the host, perhaps acting as adhesins (Calabi et al., 2002). Sequence, and perhaps structural, variability in the LMW SLPs of different C. difficile strains may result in an alteration in receptor specificity. However, the presence of a conserved region on the surface of domain 2 could reflect a conserved functional motif within this otherwise variable domain. Gram-positive bacteria employ several mechanisms for the attachment of surface-located proteins to the cell wall. The best characterized of these are the sortase pathway (Marraffini et al., 2006) and the binding of some SLPs to pyruvylated secondary cell wall polymers via SLH domains (Mesnage et al., 2000; Sara, 2001). C. difficile does not appear to favour either of these pathways, as its SLPs do not contain SLH domains and there are few predicted sortase substrates found in the C. difficile genome. Within C. difficile, the SLPs are members of a family of at least 29 proteins, each of which also contain two or three copies of the cell wall-binding PF04122 motif (Calabi et al., 2001; Karjalainen et al., 2001) The HMW SLP contains two such motifs, located adjacent to the domain essential for interaction with the LMW SLP (see Fig. 4). Other proteins containing this motif include the Cwp66 adhesin (Waligora et al., 2001) and the Cwp84 protease (Janoir et al., 2007). Others are of unknown function, but some are expressed either in vitro (Wright et al., 2005) or during infection, as seen by reactivity of human post-infection sera (Wright et al., 2008). This family of C. difficile proteins most likely share a common mechanism of attachment to the surface of the bacterium. Future structural studies of the S-layer of C. difficile, including the HMW SLP and the H/L complex, will further our understanding of S-layer assembly in C. difficile in general and the biogenesis of these surface proteins in this important human pathogen.

grown in Luria­Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. Overnight Express instant TB medium and Overnight Express System 2 medium were used for the production of recombinant proteins. C. difficile strain 630 (CD630) was grown in Brain­ Heart Infusion (BHI) broth or on Blood-agar base (Oxoid) supplemented with 7.5% defibrinated horse blood. Growth was carried out under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) at 37°C. Strain genotypes and plasmid descriptions are given in Table S1.

Plasmid construction and protein purification
Clostridium difficile SLPs were produced by the low-pH glycine extraction method described previously (Calabi et al., 2002). Briefly bacteria were grown overnight in BHI broth, collected by centrifugation, washed once with 0.1 volume of PBS and re-suspended in 0.01 volume of 0.2 M glycine pH 2.2. Cells were incubated with rotation for 30 min, centrifuged and the supernatant containing the SLPs removed and neutralized by the addition of 2 M Tris base. Recombinant C. difficile CD630 LMW SLP and HMW SLP were produced in E. coli as C-terminal 6xHis-tagged proteins from plasmids pLMW630 and pHMW630 respectively (Calabi et al., 2001). All other plasmids used in this study were derived by inverse PCR from these two parental constructs. Briefly, 5phosphorylated inverse oligonucleotides (Eurofins MWG Operon), each containing a 5 CGC overhang, were designed flanking the region to be deleted (Table S2) and PCR was carried out with these primers and the parental plasmid as template. The resulting PCR product was digested with DpnI, to remove template DNA, ligated with Quick-Stick Ligase (Bioline) and transformed into chemically competent E. coli DH5a. The 5 CGC overhangs introduce a novel BssHII site into the resulting plasmid allowing for rapid screening of clones. For recombinant protein expression and purification, plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta and grown in Overnight Express Instant TB medium. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed either by using a French press (three cycles at 6.9 MPa), or by the addition of BugBuster bacterial lysis reagent (Merck). Recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-agarose columns using an AKTA prime (GE Healthcare). LMW SLP and its derivatives were purified from the soluble fraction following lysis of bacteria with BugBuster. HMW SLP and its derivatives were purified under denaturing conditions from inclusion bodies following lysis of bacteria with BugBuster or by French press. Denatured proteins were refolded by incremental dialysis from 8 M urea to native conditions. All proteins were dialysed against 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl prior to analysis or long-term storage. For production of SeMet-substituted protein, E. coli strain Rosetta harbouring plasmid pLMW1-262 was grown in Overnight Express System 2 medium substituted with 125 mg ml-1 L-seleno-methionine. Protein was purified as described above. SeMet occupancy was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (University of Cambridge, Chemistry Department, Mass Spectrometry Facility). SlpA sequences for R20291 and NF2029 were deposited at EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database with the accession codes FM160739 and FM160740.

Protein analysis
SDS-PAGE was carried out using standard methods. Native PAGE was carried out using discontinuous Bis-Tris gels (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Sauer:bis-Tris_SDS-PAGE,_ the_very_best). For immunblot analyses, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore) using a three-buffer semi-dry method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies to the CD630 HMW and LMW SLPs were raised in rabbits against purified recombinant proteins produced in E. coli and used at dilutions of 1:100 000 or 1:200 000 respectively. Primary antibodies were detected using a HRP-conjugated goat a-rabbit secondary antibody (Dako) diluted 1:2000 and the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).

Analysis of protein­protein interactions by ELISA
Maxisorp microtitre plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4°C with 50 ml well-1 of 4.92 mM HMW SLP (or its deletion derivatives) or 5.66 mM LMW SLP (or its deletion derivatives) diluted in PBS and blocked with 100 ml well-1 of 3% (w/v) non-fat powdered milk in PBS for 2 h. Plates were then incubated with dilutions of LMW SLP (1.4 mM to 24 pM) or HMW SLP (490 to 0.48 nM) for 1 h, washed with PBS/0.05% (v/v) Tween-20, incubated for 1 h with polyclonal a-LMW or a-HMW antibodies diluted 1:30 000 or 1:15 000, respectively, and for a further 1 h with a HRP-conjugated goat a-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:1000. Protein binding was measured at 490 nm using the colorimetric substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD). Replicate absorbance values were averaged and reference subtracted. Dose­response curves were fitted to a 1:1 binding model using GraFit 6 (Erithacus Software) and dissociation (KD) constants calculated. Unless otherwise stated all proteins and antibodies were diluted in 3% milk, 0.05% Tween-20, PBS and incubations were at 37°C.

protein concentration of 10 mg ml-1 was mixed in a ratio of 2:1 with a crystallization solution [25% (w/v) PEG 1500, 0.1 M SPG (succinic acid, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, glycine), pH 4.0] to a final volume of 3 ml. The SeMet-substituted protein crystals grew from a protein solution at 12 mg ml-1 mixed with a crystallization solution containing 20% (w/v) PEG 1500 and 0.1 M SPG buffer, pH 4.3. Crystals were cryo-protected in a solution containing 30% (w/v) PEG 1500 and 0.1 M SPG buffer, and subsequently cryo-cooled by submersion in liquid N2. The X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a 2.4 Tesla 10 pole wiggler beamline (Station 10.1, SRS, Daresbury, UK) equipped with a MAR 225 CCD detector. In the case of the native data set, data were collected for 360° of the reciprocal space, whereas for the 3-wavelength MAD experiment, 180° of data were collected for each wavelength using an inverted geometry strategy with data collected in wedges of 30°. Reflection intensities were integrated using HKL2000 software (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997).

Crystal structure determination and refinement
The CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) was used along with other software cited below. Initial phase calculation and density modifications for the LMW SLP1-262 crystal structure were carried out with autoSHARP (Vonrhein et al., 2007) using the 3-wavelength MAD data set, which yielded an electron density map containing regions of well-resolved a-helices from which it was possible to trace most of the C-a backbone (Fig. S2A). Initial model building was carried out using Buccaneer (Cowtan, 2006) and manual building with Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) followed by automated model rebuilding using AutoBuild and refinement using phenix.refine, both part of the PHENIX package (Adams et al., 2002). For refinement, observed structure factor amplitudes were extracted from the native data set and a phased maximum-likelihood target was used throughout refinement. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. Figures were generated using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org). The LMW SLP1-262 crystal structure has been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under PDB code 3CVZ.

Size-exclusion chromatography
H/L complex size estimation was carried out using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 chromatography column connected to an AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare). The column was calibrated using six high- and low-molecular-weight calibration standards (Sigma) ranging in size from 29 000 to 669 000 Da and the void volume was determined using blue dextran, CD630 SLP proteins were isolated as described above and 0.5 ml (approximately 1 mg ml-1) was loaded and eluted over two column volumes. Proteins were separated at 4°C using 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl as the running buffer and a flow rate of 0.4 ml min-1. Eluted fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE.

SAXS data collection and structure determination
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data for the LMW SLP, LMW SLP1-262 and H/L complex were collected on a MAR345 image plate detector at the X33 beamline of the EMBL (DESY, Hamburg) (Roessle et al., 2007). The scattering patterns were measured with a 3 min exposure time for protein samples at a minimum of three different protein concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg ml-1. Samples were incubated with 1 mM dithiothreitol before data collection. To check for radiation damage, two 2 min exposures were compared and no radiation damage was observed. Using the sample-todetector distance of 2.7 m, the range of momentum transfer values is 0.009 < q < 0.5 Å-1 [q = 4psin(q)/l, where 2q is the scattering angle, and l = 1.5 Å is the X-ray wavelength].

Crystallization and data collection
Crystals of the native and SeMet-substituted LMW SLP1-262 grew over a period of 3 weeks to a maximum size of between 0.5 and 0.7 mm using the sitting drop vapour-diffusion crystallization technique. For the crystallization of native protein crystals, protein solution (10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5) at a

Data were processed using standard procedures and extrapolated to infinite dilution by the program package PRIMUS (Konarev et al., 2003). The forward scattering I(0) and the radii of gyration Rg were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (Guinier, 1939) assuming the intensity is represented as I(q) = I(0)exp[-(qRg)2/3] for a very small range of momentum transfer values (q < 1.3/Rg). The maximum dimensions Dmax and the interatomic distance distribution functions P(r) were computed using GNOM (Svergun, 1992). The molecular masses of the proteins were all evaluated by comparison with the forward scattering with that from a reference solution of bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). The scattering pattern from the high-resolution model of LMW SLP1-262 in the crystal was computed using CRYSOL (Svergun et al., 1995). In each case, 20 low-resolution SAXS structures were calculated ab intio using either the program DAMMIN (Svergun, 1999) for full-length LMW SLP and LMW SLP1-262, or MONSA (Svergun, 1999; Svergun and Nierhaus, 2000) for H/L complex modelling. MONSA is an extended version of DAMMIN that allows for simultaneously fitting multiple experimental data during multiphase bead modelling. The H/L complex was modelled using two data sets: (i) the data set corresponding to the LMW SLP and (ii) the data set corresponding to the H/L complex. Using this method, a multiphase (e.g. a complex) system can be modelled, which allows the localization of individual phases within a complex, in this particular case corresponding to the localization of the LMW and the HMW SLPs that constitute the H/L complex. Furthermore, this ab intio modelling shows with clarity the region of interaction, representing a much more realistic model. Model averaging was carried out with the program DAMAVER (Volkov and Svergun, 2003). Data collection and structure modelling parameters are reported in Table 2.
