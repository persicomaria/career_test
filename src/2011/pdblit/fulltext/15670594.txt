Novel Catalytic Mechanism of Glycoside Hydrolysis Based on the Structure of an NAD /Mn2 -Dependent Phospho- -Glucosidase from Bacillus subtilis

Anderson1,* 1 Molecular Pharmacology and Biological Chemistry Feinberg School of Medicine Northwestern University Chicago, Illinois 60611 2 Biosciences Division Argonne National Laboratory Argonne, Illinois 60439 3 Department of Chemistry University of British Columbia Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1 Canada 4 Department of Chemistry University of York Heslington, York Y015DD United Kingdom 5 Microbial Biochemistry and Genetics Unit Oral Infection and Immunity Branch NIDCR National Institutes of Health Bethesda, Maryland 20892 (M6P) is hydrolyzed by GlvA, yielding glucose and glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), both of which can enter the energy-generating glycolytic pathway (Thompson et al., 1998). GlvA is a 6-phospho- -glucosidase belonging to family 4 of the glycoside hydrolases (GH4 [Coutinho and Henrissat, 1999]). GH4 enzymes are unique in their requirement for NAD(H) and a divalent metal ion for activity, unlike glycoside hydrolases from other families (Thompson et al., 1998). The GH4 family is also unique in that it includes both -glycosidases, such as GlvA (Lapidus et al., 1997) from B. subtilis, and -glycosidases, such as the 6-phospho- -glucosidase CelF (Thompson et al., 1999) from Escherichia coli (Figure 1; Supplemental Figure SA). Members of this family can hydrolyze both phosphorylated (GlvA) and nonphosphorylated (galactosidase) disaccharides, as is the case with family 1 glycosidases (Coutinho and Henrissat, 1999), as well as a variety of other natural and synthetic - and -glucosides (Thompson et al., 1995, 1998, 1999, 2001a, 2001b). The coenzyme NAD(H) does not appear to be altered following the reaction (Thompson et al., 1998), and its role in catalysis has thus far been unclear. The unique appearance of both - and -glycosidases within one family and the requirement for NAD(H) suggest a novel catalytic mechanism for this group of glycosidases (Thompson et al., 1995, 1998, 1999, 2001a, 2001b; Varrot et al., 1999; Bouma et al., 1997). There are currently two known glycosidase mechanisms, resulting in either net inversion or retention of anomeric configuration as suggested by Koshland 50 years ago (Koshland, 1953). Inverting glycosidases carry out a direct displacement using a pair of carboxylic ° acids separated by 6­12 A as acid and base catalysts. Retaining glycosidases use a double-displacement ° mechanism in which the 5 A separation of the carboxylic acids permits an initial acid-catalyzed formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate that subsequently undergoes base-catalyzed hydrolysis (Zechel and Withers, 2000), both steps occurring via oxocarbenium ion-like transition states. We have determined the crystal structure of GlvA in complex with NAD(H), Mn2 , and the reaction product ° G6P to a resolution of 2.05 A. The structure of GlvA shows no similarity to that of any known glycosidases outside of the GH4 family, but does show resemblance to those of lactate/malate dehydrogenases, despite low ( 15%) sequence identity. Another -glucosidase of the GH4 family, AglA from Thermotoga maritima, first showed the structural similarity to these dehydrogenases (Lodge et al., 2003). Similarity between GlvA and the dehydrogenases extends beyond the NAD(H) binding (Rossmann fold) region and includes the spatial arrangement of several key active site residues. These findings suggest that the GH4 enzymes and the organic acid dehydrogenases diverged from a common precursor that subsequently adapted mechanistically to different metabolic requirements. The similarity to the dehydrogenases, particularly the

Summary GlvA, a 6-phospho- -glucosidase from Bacillus subtilis, catalyzes the hydrolysis of maltose-6 -phosphate and belongs to glycoside hydrolase family GH4. GH4 enzymes are unique in their requirement for NAD(H) and a divalent metal for activity. We have determined the crystal structure of GlvA in complex with its ligands ° to 2.05 A resolution. Analyses of the active site architecture, in conjunction with mechanistic studies and precedent from the nucleotide diphosphate hexose dehydratases and other systems, suggest a novel mechanism of glycoside hydrolysis by GlvA that involves both the NAD(H) and the metal. Introduction Carbohydrate assimilation in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria is frequently initiated via the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PEP-PTS). The PEP-PTS consists of several cytoplasmic and membrane proteins that together enable the simultaneous phosphorylation and transport of sugars across the cytoplasmic membrane (Meadow et al., 1990). This system is the primary route for maltose translocation in B. subtilis and is regulated by the glv operon (Yamamoto et al., 2001). Maltose is transported into the cytoplasm, concomitant with its phosphorylation by GlvC, a membrane-anchored permease (Yamamoto et al., 2001). Intracellular maltose-6 -phosphate

The 1 and 2 structures of GlvA are color-coded as follows: N-terminal Rossmann fold region A in blue and the following region B in green. Sequence alignment was done using Multalin/Espript (Gouet et al., 1999; Corpet, 1998) programs and was modified. Structural alignments of GlvA with AglA and LDH were done using algorithms implemented in PdbViewer (Guex and Peitsch, 1997).

retention of the same active-site architecture, and a lack of similarity to glycoside hydrolases of other families provided another indication that GH4 enzymes employ a novel mechanism of catalysis. On the basis of structural and mechanistic studies, we propose a reaction

mechanism that includes redox steps involving NAD and stabilization of intermediates by Mn2 . The proposed mechanism also satisfies the varied substrate stereochemistry seen in reactions catalyzed by GH4 enzymes. Part of the proposed mechanism bears some similarity

The structural and functional studies of GlvA support a reaction mechanism unanticipated during the past 50 years of research on glycoside hydrolysis. We also compare the GlvA structure to that of an inactive form of AglA (Lodge et al., 2003), for which few mechanistic studies have yet been reported. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary implications of our findings in terms of sequence, structure, function, and reaction mechanism of GlvA and the GH4 family of enzymes. Results GlvA was crystallized both in the presence and absence of its known ligands. While the crystals of the complexes generally did not diffract well, a crystal of protein with ° no added ligands diffracted to 2.05 A. Surprisingly, the electron density map calculated for this crystal revealed the presence of endogenous ligands that were interpreted as NAD(H), Mn2 , and the reaction product G6P, presumably carried through during the purification of the protein. Crystallization conditions, diffraction quality, cell dimensions, and space group assignment of these crystals (Table 1) are similar to the preliminary data previously reported (Varrot et al., 1999). Overall Structure The structure of GlvA can be divided into three regions, A­C (Figure 2A), comprising residues 1­170, 171­309, and 310­440, respectively. Region A at the amino terminus consists of six strands that alternate with helices

to form a six-stranded parallel sheet. This prominent feature also contains the characteristic glycine-rich sequence which, together with the topological arrangement of secondary structure, is consistent with a Rossmann fold that is involved in binding NAD(H), as had been suggested by sequence analysis (Thompson et al., 1998, 2001a; Raasch et al., 2002). Region B is composed of six helices and a highly twisted three-stranded antiparallel sheet. Region C is composed of a twisted, threestranded antiparallel sheet and four helices. The coenzyme NAD(H), the reaction product G6P, and divalent metal ion are located in the form of a letter "V" with the metal ion at the vertex. The nicotinamide ring of NAD(H) and the O2 and O3 of G6P converge on the metal ion that is anchored between the two rings. The phosphate group of G6P points away from the metal (Figure 2A). GlvA is known to be active as a homotetramer in the presence of Mn2 and NAD(H) (Thompson et al., 1998). In the I222 space group of our GlvA crystals, there is one subunit per asymmetric unit (asu), a tetramer being formed by the three mutually perpendicular crystallographic 2-fold axes. There are two sets of interactions in the tetramer within the crystal lattice, both of which are outside the Rossmann fold (Figure 2B). Interactions between neighboring monomers across the horizontal 2-fold axis (in Figure 2B) are extensive and include helices 10, 14, 15, and the loops that connect 9 and 9, and 15 and 16. The other dimer interface across the vertical 2-fold axis (in Figure 2B) includes residues of strands 7, 10, and 12, along with those of loops between 8 and 8, and 10 and 11. The buried surface area (CNS ver1.1) at the interface of one pair of monomers ° across the axis that is horizontal in Figure 2B is 2586 A2,

Structure 1622

and that between one pair of subunits across the vertical ° 2-fold axis is 1727 A2. Structural Similarity to the Dehydrogenases A search for structural homologs of GlvA by DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993) revealed extensive similarity to oxyacid dehydrogenases as reported for AglA (Lodge et al., 2003). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH [Buehner et al., 1974]; for example, 1LDG from Plasmodium falciparum [Dunn et al., 1996]) catalyzes the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate, while malate dehydrogenase (MDH) (1EMD from E. coli [Hall and Banaszak, 1993]) converts malate to oxaloacetate, both using NAD as oxidant. The secondary structural elements and their relative positions are similar in GlvA and LDH (Figures 1 and 3A). In fact, when the peptide backbone atoms of GlvA and LDH are compared using the SwissPdbViewer, 680 atoms from ° 170 residues can be aligned with an rmsd of 1.81 A. These residues are from all three regions of the structure, though most of them are a part of the Rossmann fold (region A). Structure-based sequence alignment of LDH with GlvA (Figure 1) reveals an insertion of 60 residues (Ala250­Ser310) in region B of GlvA that are part of helices 9­12 and strand 9. Also, GlvA has an extension of 50 residues at its C terminus, relative to LDH. The relative positions of the ligands, their interactions with the protein, as well as the interactions between the ligands themselves are preserved in both enzymes (Figures 3B and 3C). As examples, an asparagine makes contacts with both substrate and NAD in LDH, as does Asn149 of GlvA, while an active site histidine in LDH interacts with the substrate, as does His202 in GlvA, where it also coordinates the metal ion. In the LDH active site, Arg109 and Arg172 are involved in binding the substrate (or inhibitor) carboxylate moiety, as are the similarly situated Arg95 and Arg285 in GlvA. This active site architecture suggests that glycoside hydrolysis by GlvA might involve the coenzyme in a critical step similar to that in the reaction mechanism of LDH. Active Site of GlvA Many of the contacts that the ligands [metal ion, G6P, and NAD(H)] make with the protein are localized to the nucleotide binding domain or the Rossmann fold region (region A), with essentially all the residues that interact with NAD(H) being conserved in the entire family (Figure 1; see Supplemental Figure SA). Key residues such as Asn149, Cys171, and His202 are invariant within the family and in the case of GlvA are involved in interactions with NAD(H), metal ion, and the substrate (Figure 3C). At the wavelength of data collection, the anomalous scattering components f of Mg, Mn, and Se are 0.07, 1.3, and 3.8, respectively. In anomalous difference Fourier maps, we observed a signal at 3 for the metal ion relative to 18 for Se. Based on this anomalous signal, the coordination geometry (Harding, 2001), and the biochemical data that show maximum enzyme activity in the presence of Mn2 compared to other metal ions (Thompson et al., 1998), the metal ion in our refined electron density maps was modeled as Mn2 with an occupancy of 0.5. These observations rule out the possibility that this ion could be Mg2 from the crystallization

Ligands are presented as ball-and-stick with NAD in brick red, Mn2 in dark pink, and reaction product (G6P) in dark blue. (B) C -trace of GlvA tetramer. Within the crystal lattice, a tetramer is formed by the crystallographic 2-fold axes. In this tetramer, interactions across the horizontal 2-fold (x) axis are more extensive than those across the vertical (y) axis. The third (z) axis is perpendicular to the plane of this rendering. The active site pocket is not formed by the intersubunit interfaces, and all the ligands point away from these interfaces.

Key interactions between protein and ligands, i.e., the nicotinamide ring of NAD and inhibitor oxamate in LDH (B), and the nicotinamide ring of NAD, reaction product G6P, and Mn2 in GlvA (C), are presented. (C) also shows the octahedral coordination of Mn2 , which involves interactions with G6P, H2O152, and the conserved Cys171 in a single plane, while the bond with His202 is perpendicular to this plane as is the interaction with the nicotinamide ring of NAD in the opposite direction to that of His202. C atoms are depicted in gray, N in blue, O in red, S in yellow, P in orange, and Mn2 in pale pink. Important interactions are shown as broken black lines, while some of those directly involved in catalysis are highlighted in green.

conditions, since its anomalous signal would have been nearly ten times smaller than what was observed and well below the noise level of the anomalous difference electron density map. However, X-ray fluorescence suggests that the crystal contains a mixture of transition metals including Mn, Fe, Ni, and Zn. A metal ion was

also observed at this site in a second crystal of the protein that was not purified by metal affinity chromatography and was crystallized in the presence of excess Mn2 (A.V. and G.J.D., unpublished data). This crystal of GlvA, in complex with Mn2 and NAD(H), did not show any density in the active site corresponding to the G6P

This figure was prepared with BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997) and rendered in Raster3D. (B) Active sites of AglA and GlvA. GlvA and AglA (1OBB [Lodge et al., 2003]) were aligned in Swiss PdbViewer via their main chain atoms, and the superposition of their active site residues is shown here. The ligands, NAD(H), metal, and G6P of GlvA are shown in pale pink, while the maltose substrate and NAD(H) of AglA are presented in maroon. The protein residues belonging to GlvA are shown in aquamarine, while those of AglA are shown in gray with O, N, and S atoms colored red, blue, and yellow, respectively. Of interest is the nonsuperposition of the ligands of AglA on to those of GlvA, while the protein residues align reasonably well.

seen in the structure reported here. The two structures of GlvA with and without the G6P can be aligned by ° their C with an rmsd of 0.58 A with very similar positions of the metal, the coenzyme, and their interacting residues. Coordination of Mn2 in GlvA is achieved through interactions with Cys171, His202, H2O152, and O7 of the nicotinamide ring of NAD(H), and O2 and O3 of G6P (Figures 3C, 4A, and 4B). Additional details of the active site components and the distances of interacting groups are presented in Supplemental Figure SB. In trying to identify the compound that copurified with the protein and that is bound at the active site in our GlvA structure, we fitted both and anomers of G6P and also a flattened ring intermediate (as proposed in the reaction mechanism). The flattened ring showed the worst fit of the three to the electron density. Although there may be a mixture of both and anomers in the crystal, the density is somewhat more consistent with O1 being , and this is what has been modeled (Figure 4A). Interaction partners with the G6P product include Mn2 , the nicotinamide moiety of NAD(H), and Asp172 with O2, Mn2 , H2O152, and Asn149 with O3, Glu111 and Asn149 with O4, and Tyr265 with O5 (Figures 3C, ° 4A, and 4B). The O1 of G6P in the position is 3.15 A from the oxygen of Asp172 in this structure. Binding of a substrate, such as maltose-6 -phosphate, in the binding mode we observe for G6P would result in a short ° (2.45 A) hydrogen bond from Asp172 to the O1 and close contacts between the nonphosphorylated glucose moiety and Asp172 and His320. Although one could speculate on the role of these steric conflicts in favoring formation of an intermediate or transition state, the present results do not provide an indication of how the protein or substrate may adapt in the enzyme-substrate complex.

The observed structure suggests that Asp172 will have an essential role in catalysis in the -glucosidases of GH4, most likely as the acid/base catalyst. In some enzymes of the GH4 family, including AglA, a histidine is found at the corresponding position, suggesting that a histidine plays the role of acid/base catalyst in those family members. The cofactor is located in close proxim° ity to the substrate, with C4 of NAD located 3.56 A from C3 of G6P in GlvA, suggesting that an oxidation may occur at this position. As a comparison, in LDH (1LDG), ° C4 of NAD is found 3.45 A from C1 of the inhibitor ° oxamate, while in MDH (1EMD) it is 3.52 A from C4 of the inhibitor citrate. Interestingly, the relative locations of the NAD and the substrate are such that in GlvA the hydride moiety transferred would be the pro-R hydrogen of the NADH so formed, whereas in the case of AglA it would appear to be the pro-S hydrogen. This difference arises from the different orientation of the NAD in the active site in the two cases. The mechanistic implications of all the above are discussed below. Structural Comparison with Another GH4 Member, AglA AglA, an -glucosidase from T. maritima, is one of the largest members of the GH4 family, with 480 amino acids compared to 440 residues for the rest of the family. Both AglA and GlvA hydrolyze -glucosides, although, unlike GlvA, AglA does not require its substrates to be phosphorylated. While residues presumed to be important in catalysis are in similar positions in both structures, their placement with respect to the NAD(H) and the substrate are different. Comparison of their primary structures shows four significant insertions in AglA relative to GlvA, which occur mainly between residues 200

Family 4 Glycosidase Structure and Mechanism 1625

and 300. These insertions render sequence alignment in this region difficult, and published alignments (Lodge et al., 2003) are misleading. However, alignment of the two structures is a more reliable measure for comparison. Superposition of the GlvA and AglA (1OBB [Lodge et al., 2003]) structures via their backbone atoms shows that the overall structure of GlvA is quite similar to that of AglA (see Supplemental Figure SC). While the active site residues are at similar locations in both structures, the position and orientation of the substrate maltose and coenzyme NAD are different in AglA compared to GlvA (Figure 4B). The nonreducing glucose moiety of the maltose in the AglA structure does not exactly align with the G6P in the GlvA structure. Orientation of the nicotinamide ring of NAD(H) in AglA is also different from that of GlvA, though this portion of the NAD(H) is noted as being poorly defined in the AglA structure (Lodge et al., 2003). In the AglA structure, the metal ion is absent (Lodge et al., 2003), probably due to the oxidation of the active site Cys174 (Cys171 in GlvA) to sulfinic acid (Figure 4B). In the absence of metal, positions of the coenzyme and the substrate and their interactions with protein residues are all significantly altered, presumably accounting for the inactivity of this form. Due to the oxidized cysteine in the active site and the lack of the metal ion, the AglA structure left unclear the catalytic mechanism and the role of NAD(H). In AglA, the absence of arginines corresponding to the positions 95 and 285 of GlvA is consistent with the preference of the former for nonphosphorylated substrates. Asp119 (corresponding to Glu111 of GlvA) interacts with the substrate at the O4 position. The environments around this residue in the two enzymes are different because of the insertion Lys102­Ala111 in AglA and an insertion in GlvA of Cys113­Gly116 relative to AglA (compare the structure-based sequence alignment in Figure 1 with the mathematical sequence alignment in Supplemental Figure SA). Most significantly, Asp260 of AglA occupies the position of Tyr265 in GlvA. Tyr265 most likely functions as a catalytic base to abstract a proton from C2 of the substrate, as described below. The nonreducing glucose moiety of the maltose bound to AglA (Lodge et al. 2003) corresponds to the G6P observed in the GlvA structure. However, when the polypeptide backbones (Figure 4B) are superimposed, the pyranose rings are tilted with respect to each other. The result is that although C3 and C4 atoms are not far apart, the O1 atom of maltose ends up, not where the O1 atom of G6P would be when in the position, but closer to where we have placed the -G6P O1. Presumably the recognition and binding of this pyranose by the protein and metal ion bring it further into the binding site, closer to the NAD and to Asp172. Another difference between GlvA and AglA is in their oligomeric structures. In the P21 space group of the AglA crystal structure, there are two possible dimer interfaces (Lodge et al., 2003). Based on the regions of the polypeptide involved, the dimer preferred by Lodge and colleagues roughly corresponds to the association of subunits across the 2-fold axis of GlvA that is horizontal in Figure 2B. However, the possible dimers in the AglA crystal structure have much smaller buried surface area ° at their interfaces (1248 and 1051 A2) compared to those of GlvA.

Mechanistic Analysis A defining mechanistic element of any glycosidase is whether it hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond with net inversion or retention of anomeric configuration. Determination of stereochemical outcome by direct 1H NMR analysis of the enzymatic reaction mixture was not possible because of the requirement for (paramagnetic) Mn2 , which broadens signals. Furthermore, the relatively rapid mutarotation of the G6P product (Balaban and Ferretti, 1983) precluded "stopped" approaches involving removal of Mn2 ion. However, to our advantage, the enzyme was found to retain reasonable activity in 5 M methanol, with the formation of a stable methyl 6-phosphoglucoside product. HPLC analysis of such reaction mixtures revealed exclusive formation of the -anomer of methyl 6-phosphoglucoside, thereby demonstrating that GlvA is a retaining glucosidase. The inference that other GH4 enzymes are also retainers is supported by further evidence from the mechanistic studies on another GH4 enzyme BglT, a 6-phospho- -glucosidase (Yip et al., 2004). Of particular interest was the observation by 1H-NMR that, when this reaction was carried out in D2O buffer in the absence of methanol, followed by removal of the GlvA protein and Mn2 , the C-2 proton in the product was fully exchanged with deuterium, yielding 2-{2H}-D-glucose-6-phosphate. Control experiments in which the substrate and product were incubated in D2O buffer in the absence of enzyme for similar time periods revealed no such exchange. This proton exchange is presumably an important part of the mechanism.

Discussion Substrate Specificity and Site-Directed Mutagenesis GlvA requires -glycoside substrates with equatorial configurations of the OH groups at C2 and C4, and a phosphate group at O6 (Thompson et al., 1998). As noted earlier, the enzyme also requires NAD(H) and a divalent metal ion (Mn2 , Fe2 , Ni2 , or Co2 ) for catalysis (Thompson et al., 1998). Active site interactions observed in the crystal structure are consistent with these observations. The involvement of NAD(H) and the metal ion in extensive and specific interactions at the active site of GlvA, both with the protein and with the substrate/product, provides the precise positioning of the substrate and all the other reaction components for hydrolysis to occur. While the phosphoglucose moiety is clearly tightly coordinated, there would appear to be far fewer interactions with the leaving group, fully consistent with earlier observations (Thompson et al., 1998) about the ability of GlvA to cleave a range of 6-phospho- -glucosides, including maltose-6 -phosphate, trehalose-6 -phosphate, p-nitrophenyl- -D-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate, and 4-methylumbelliferyl- -D-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate (Thompson et al., 1998). Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies had shown that Asp41, Glu111, and Glu359 are essential for GlvA activity (Thompson et al., 1998). Asp41 and Glu359 are invariant in the GH4 family (Figure 1; see Supplemental Figure SA), while Glu111 is conservatively substituted with Asp in other enzymes of this family. Asp41 makes

extensive contacts with the ribose of NAD(H), which would likely be perturbed if this residue were mutated, as suggested previously (Thompson et al., 1998; Raasch et al., 2002). Similarly, mutation of Glu111 might affect substrate binding, and this residue appears to play a key role in the reaction mechanism, though not in the manner proposed previously (Thompson et al., 1998). The role of Glu359, however, is not clear. It is located at the end of strand 11, quite distant from the active site, and it does not interact with any of the ligands. However, it may be noted that Glu359 makes main chain and side chain contacts with Gly199 and Asn201, both of which are invariant in the entire family. More importantly, these residues are immediate neighbors of His202, which is not only conserved within the family but is essential in coordinating the metal ion. It is quite likely that mutation of Glu359 would lead to improper positioning of His202, resulting in impaired activity. Proposed Mechanism of Glycoside Hydrolysis GlvA is a retaining 6-phospho- -glycosidase that carries out solvent proton exchange into C2 of the product during catalysis. Control experiments confirmed that the observed exchange was not a trivial nonenzymatic event. This implies that the GlvA mechanism involves proton abstraction from C2, reminiscent of events occurring during the -glucan lyase reaction in which a

1,2-unsaturated hydroxyglucal product is formed via an elimination reaction (Lee et al., 2002). The -glucan lyase mechanism is not sufficient to explain the GlvA reaction since the lyase does not make use of NAD, nor would it account for the formation of G6P as product. However, if the NAD serves to first transiently oxidize O3, this would render H2 significantly more acidic, facilitating deprotonation, which would be followed by elimination. This is the case in sugar dehydratases, which also carry out an elimination reaction as their contribution to the pathways of deoxysugar biosynthesis (Allard et al., 2001, 2002). The proposed intermediate formed by GlvA would be a 1,2-unsaturated Michael acceptor, which is much more reactive toward attack of water in a subsequent step than would be a simple hydroxyglycal. The process would be completed by reduction of the C3 ketone by the on-board NADH, returning the enzyme to its starting state. The proposed mechanism (Figure 5) is completely consistent with the active site structure observed. The NAD is perfectly positioned to extract the hydride from C3 of the substrate. In concert with general basecatalyzed alcohol deprotonation, possibly by a metalbound hydroxide, the 3-hydroxyl is thereby oxidized to the ketone. Interestingly, the mechanistically analogous TDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (Allard et al., 2001), which carries out the 5,6-elimination of water from the glucose moiety of its substrate, and the UDP-galactose

Family 4 Glycosidase Structure and Mechanism 1627

4-epimerase (Thoden et al., 2000), which inverts the C4 stereochemistry of its sugar, both use an on-board NAD to oxidize and then reduce a sugar hydroxyl. These enzymes both seem to use a tyrosine as the base that deprotonates the hydroxyl group (Allard et al., 2001; Thoden et al., 2000). The second step in catalysis is proposed to involve elimination across the 1,2 bond. It thus requires both acid catalysis of aglycone departure and base catalysis to abstract the proton at C2. The best candidate for the catalytic base in GlvA is Tyr265, which could be activated for this role by the nearby Glu111, operating through an intervening water molecule. This arrangement is similar to that found in chrondroitin AC lyase, where a Tyr is proposed to function as a general base and the proton taken up by a Glu via a His (Lunin et al., 2004). Interestingly, Tyr265 does not appear to be conserved in all enzymes of family 4; indeed, in the AglA structure an Asp is found at this location. Because of differences in the polypeptide backbone in this region, an oxygen of the Asp in AglA is close to the Tyr265 hydroxyl of GlvA. Proton abstraction at C2 is also facilitated by the metal ion, which polarizes the carbonyl at C3 and stabilizes the resultant enolate species. Elimination of the glucose moiety could then occur via breakage of the anomeric carbon-oxygen bond, with acid catalytic assistance from Asp172. Finding a carboxylic acid in this role is unsurprising since the dehydratases also use such residues and since carboxylic acids have been invariably found as the acid/base catalysts in conventional glycosidases (Zechel and Withers, 2000; Allard et al., 2001). Interestingly, however, as noted earlier, Asp172 is apparently replaced by a His in some enzymes of the GH4 family, while this position in the sequence is occupied by an Asn in the -hydrolases. An equivalent acid/base residue presumably exists in the -glucosidases on the opposite side (relative to Asp/His172 in -glucosidases) of the substrate plane. However, because amino acid sequence alignments between residues 210­330 are uncertain, identifying the equivalent of Asp172 for the -specific enzymes is not apparent from this information alone. The third step in catalysis would involve the addition of water across the double bond of this , -unsaturated Michael acceptor. Since we have shown that GlvA is a retaining -glucosidase, this addition must occur from the " face" of the substrate, with Asp172 acting as the general base catalyst and the metal ion again stabilizing the enolate so generated. Reprotonation of the enolate will then occur from Tyr265 via the reverse of the proton abstraction process. During the course of this mechanism, there is clearly time for exchange of the proton on Tyr265 with solvent water, as witnessed by the solvent proton "wash-in" observed. The final step in the overall mechanism would involve reduction of the ketone at C3 to yield the G6P product, regenerating the NAD. This proposed mechanism, which is an intriguing blend of the mechanisms of the 4,5 and 1,2-lyases coupled with the redox steps of the dehydratases, explains all the known features of this mechanistically fascinating family of enzymes. The requirement for NAD, but the absence of overall redox chemistry (Thompson et al., 1998), rests in the transient oxidation at C3 to activate

the C2 proton. The metal ion is required to stabilize the -hydroxyketone intermediates, and more specifically the -hydroxyenolate species, while the proton exchange at C2 is a by-product of the elimination process. The occurrence of both - and -glycosidases in the same family is possible because the locations of the central mechanistic components (the NAD and the Tyr base) are the same for both mechanisms; only the amino acid providing the acid/base machinery needs to move. Such is not the case for "classical" retaining hydrolases, where the catalytic nucleophile must be very precisely positioned on the correct face of the substrate (Zechel and Withers, 2000). The predicted hydride and proton transfers at C3 and C2, respectively, are supported by recent kinetic isotope effect measurements on a -specific GH4 enzyme (Yip et al., 2004). The proposed mechanism also suggests possible identities for mystery compounds "X" and "Y" noted previously during the hydrolysis of maltose-6 -phosphate (Thompson et al., 1998). These could well be the ketone and , -unsaturated ketone intermediates, which may leak from the active site. This would also explain the need for some added NAD, as otherwise such a leakage would inactivate the enzyme by reducing the on-board NAD. Conclusions The GH4 enzymes are surprisingly similar to those of -hydroxy organic acid dehydrogenases in structure. Structural comparison of GlvA, a 6-phospho- -glucosidase from the GH4 family, with lactate dehydrogenase shows similarities in their active site architectures, positions of several key residues and ligands, as well as protein-ligand and interligand interactions. These analyses, in conjunction with mechanistic studies and precedent from other systems, led to the proposal of a mechanism of glucoside hydrolysis by GlvA that involves both the coenzyme NAD(H) and the metal ion. This reaction mechanism, while novel to the glycoside hydrolases, has intriguing similarities to that of the nucleoside diphosphate hexose dehydratases. The structural and mechanistic similarities of GH4 enzymes, the dehydrogenases, and the dehydratases suggest that these functionally distinct enzymes have diverged from a common precursor. The more extensive similarity between the GH4 enzymes and the -hydroxy acid dehydrogenases suggest that they are more closely related than either is to the dehydratases. The mechanistic similarity between GH4 enzymes and dehydratases may have resulted from an evolutionary convergence.
Experimental Procedures Expression and Purification The cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant GlvA in E. coli was carried out as described (Dieckman et al., 2002; Stols et al., 2002) with some modification. Selenomethionine labeling of the protein followed the methionine pathway inhibition procedure of Doublie (1997). The purified labeled protein in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.25 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 5% glycerol was used at a concentration of about 10 mg/ml for crystallization in hanging drops (1:1 protein:reservoir). Optimization of initial Hampton Research screen conditions yielded diffraction-quality crystals in 0.2 M MgCl2, 0.1 M Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 28% PEG4000, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Long rodlike crystals appeared in a mixture with some granular precipitate

after 1­2 days at 22 C. The crystals measured approximately 0.2 0.2 0.5 mm at harvest. Data Collection, Processing, and Phasing Crystals were harvested from the mother liquor and coated with a mixture of Paratone N and paraffin oil prior to mounting and rapid cooling in the nitrogen stream. The absorption edge of Se was determined from fluorescence emission scans. A single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) dataset was collected at the peak ° wavelength of Se (0.979 A) with 0.6 oscillation and an exposure of 10 s per image. A total of 180 of data was collected to a resolution ° of 2.05 A with 7-fold redundancy (Table 1). Data were integrated and scaled using the DENZO-SCALEPACK program suite (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The data were then used in a SAD routine implemented in the SOLVE/RESOLVE program suite (ver2.2 [Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999]). SOLVE was used to locate the selenium sites and RESOLVE for density modification and initial interpretation of the electron density. These programs found 16 of the 18 sites and traced 146 residues with side chains and 119 without, placing a total of 265 residues out of the 472. Model Building and Refinement Starting with the initial model generated by the auto-building algorithm in RESOLVE, XtalView (McRee, 1999) and CNS (ver1.1 [Brunger et al., 1987; Adams et al., 1997]) were used for further building of the model and its initial refinement. Missing or misinterpreted residues were manually built and refined in subsequent cycles to complete the model. Similar results were obtained with the automated crystallographic system AcrS (Brunzelle et al., 2003). We were also able to identify NAD(H), a metal ion, and presumably the reaction product G6P in the final electron density maps. Although it is subject to significant uncertainty, the three ligands were refined to an estimated occupancy of 50%. This resulted in B values for the ligands that were comparable to those of the surrounding protein side chains. Further refinement with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) from the CCP4 suite took advantage of TLS refinement. The final model contains 436 out of 472 expected residues. Of the 36 missing residues, 23 belong to the N-terminal oligohistidine tag (MHHHHHHSSGVDLGTENLYFQSNA), and 7 residues (235­241) are in a loop region that is exposed to solvent. Mechanistic Analysis via 1H NMR 1 H NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer at 400 MHz. Synthesis of the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl- -D-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate (pNP G6P) is as described by Wilson and Fox (1974) with minor modifications. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. All buffers and chemicals were lyophilized twice from 99.9% D2O. GlvA was exchanged into deuterated buffer solutions via repeated (three times) dilution and concentration using a centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) with a nominal molecular weight limit (NMWL) of 10 kDa. The enzymatic reactions were performed under the following conditions: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM NAD, 0.8 mg/ml enzyme. pNP G6P (20 mg) was incubated at 37 C in 5 ml of the above solution, and the reaction was monitored by TLC. After 24 hr, additional enzyme (2 mg) was added. After a further 24 hr, the enzyme was removed using a 10 kDa NMWL centrifugal filter unit and 100 mg of Chelex 100 resin (BioRad) added to the filtrate and stirred at room temperature for 2 hr to remove metal ions. Filtration of the resin left a solution that was lyophilized and then redissolved in D2O for 1H NMR analysis. An identical control experiment, but without enzyme, was carried out. Two other controls involved 1H NMR analysis of reaction mixtures in which the product G6P had been incubated with the buffer and cofactors in the presence and absence of GlvA. Stereochemical Outcome Determination via HPLC A reaction mixture (100 l) containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM NAD, 9.7 10 3 mg/ml enzyme, 4.4 mM pNP G6P, and 5 M MeOH was incubated at 37 C for 24 hr. Alkaline phosphatase (20 l of 1 mg/ml; Sigma) was added to cleave the sugar phosphate, and the reaction mixture incubated at 37 C for 2 hr. Then the enzymes were removed using a 10 kDa NMWL centrifugal

filter unit. The filtrate was dried under reduced pressure, redissolved in 150 l acetonitrile, and chromatographed on a Tosoh Biosep TSKGEL Amide-80 HPLC column while monitoring the elution profile with a Sedex 75 evaporative light scattering detector. The composition of the reaction mixture was determined by comparing the elution times with those of standard solutions of sodium p-nitrophenolate, p-nitrophenyl- -D-glucopyranoside, methyl- -D-glucopyranoside, methyl- -D-glucopyranoside, and glucose.
