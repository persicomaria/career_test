Studies on the Reaction Mechanism of Riboflavin Synthase: X-Ray Crystal Structure of a Complex with 6-Carboxyethyl-7-Oxo-8-Ribityllumazine

Riboflavin synthases are characterized by an internal sequence repeat, which suggested that the polypeptide folds into two domains with similar folding patterns (Figure 2) [9]. This hypothesis has been confirmed by X-ray structure analysis of riboflavin synthase of Escherichia coli [10]. Binding studies had shown earlier that each subunit of riboflavin synthase can bind two substrate analogs [11­15]. Surprisingly, the mechanistically complex dismutation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (1) can proceed in the absence of a catalyst [6, 16­18]. Riboflavin is formed when an aqueous solution of the lumazine derivative is boiled under reflux at neutral or acidic pH. The enzymecatalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions proceed with identical regiospecificity [7, 16, 17]. Gram-negative bacteria and certain yeasts are unable to incorporate riboflavin from the environment and are therefore absolutely dependent on endogenous synthesis of the vitamin [19­22]. Riboflavin synthase is therefore a potential target for the development of anti-infective drugs. The design of specific enzyme inhibitors could benefit substantially from protein structure information. The structure of riboflavin synthase from Escherichia coli has been determined by X-ray crystallography at a ° resolution of 2.1 A [10], but the substrate binding determinants and local structure of the active site have not been elucidated unambiguously. This paper reports the structure of riboflavin synthase of Schizosaccharomyces pombe in complex with the substrate analog, 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine (8; Figure 3). Results Quality of the Model Riboflavin synthase from S. pombe was crystallized in complex with the bound substrate analog, 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine (8; Figure 3). Native dif° fraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.7 A. The crystals belonged to space group P61, with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure in complex with 8 was solved by multiple anomalous dispersion techniques using synchrotron radiation. The ° structure was refined to 2.1 A resolution with crystallo22.0%) with good graphic R values of 18.5% (Rfree stereochemistry (Table 1). The final model of monomeric S. pombe riboflavin synthase (Figure 4A) consists of 203 residues that were well defined with the exception of the last 5 residues. Most of the side chains were clearly defined by their electron density, except for some surface-exposed residues.

Summary Riboflavin synthase catalyzes the disproportionation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine affording riboflavin and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione. We have determined the structure of riboflavin synthase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe in complex with the substrate analog, 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo° 8-ribityllumazine at 2.1 A resolution. In contrast to the homotrimeric solution state of native riboflavin synthase, we found the enzyme to be monomeric in the crystal structure. Structural comparison of the riboflavin synthases of S. pombe and Escherichia coli suggests oligomer contact sites and delineates the catalytic site for dimerization of the substrate and subsequent fragmentation of the pentacyclic intermediate. The pentacyclic substrate dimer was modeled into the proposed active site, and its stereochemical features were determined. The model suggests that the substrate molecule at the C-terminal domain donates a four-carbon unit to the substrate molecule bound at the N-terminal domain of an adjacent subunit in the oligomer. Introduction Riboflavin (vitamin B2) serves as a precursor of flavocoenzymes, which have essential roles as redox cofactors in all organisms. The final step in the biosynthesis of the vitamin is catalyzed by the enzyme riboflavin synthase [1­3]. This unusual reaction involves the dismutation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (1), affording riboflavin (6) and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (7) (Figure 1) [4­7]. A pentacyclic intermediate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (4, compound Q) has been de4

expression of the N-terminal domain of the E. coli protein afforded a c2 symmetric homodimer [25, 26]. The monomeric S. pombe riboflavin synthase model consists of 203 amino acids, arranged in an N-terminal barrel (residues 1­90), an almost identically folded C barrel (residues 91­184), and a C-terminal helix (residues 185­203) (Figure 4A). Superimposition of 168 -carbon atoms including both barrels and the C-terminal helix of the monomers of riboflavin synthase from S. pombe and E. coli reflects their high structural similar° ity by an rmsd value of 0.8 A (Figure 6). A structural comparison of the N-terminal barrel and the C barrel of S. pombe riboflavin synthase (Figure 4B) shows their internal pseudo-2-fold symmetry with ° an rmsd value of 0.97 A for 84 -carbon atoms.

Crystal packing and the space group clearly show that the enzyme is present as a monomer in the crystals. Meanwhile, sedimentation studies had shown a trimer in solution (our unpublished data). The sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a protein solution (0.7 mg/ml) containing 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 100 mM potassium chloride. Notably, the trimer structure was also observed by sedimentation equilibrium analysis in the presence of the inhibitor 8, which was used in the crystallization experiments. We conclude that crystallization induces dissociation, probably as a result of the high amount of methylpentanediol present. ° The temperature factors of bound 8 (23.0 A2 ) are lower ° than those of the protein on average (27.2 A2 ) (Table 1). Correspondingly, the two ligand molecules were well defined in the final electron density maps (Figure 5), indicating clearly the proposed active site arrangements and allowing insights into the reaction mechanism of riboflavin biosynthesis.

Binding of a Substrate Analog Inhibitor to the Barrel Domains We cocrystallized riboflavin synthase from S. pombe with a derivative of substrate 1, 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo8-ribityllumazine (8). This tightly bound inhibitor mole° cule is well defined in its electron density map at 2.1 A resolution and clearly indicates the location of the two substrate binding sites of each barrel domain (Figure 5). By comparison of the two barrel domains, the positions of the bound substrate analog of each barrel are matched almost exactly (Figure 2B). The substrate analogs are mainly bound through hydrophilic side chain and main chain interactions (Figures 3A and 3B). In contrast to the binding of 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine to 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase of S. pombe [27], the upstream enzyme in the riboflavin synthetic pathway, 8 is bound to S. pombe riboflavin synthase without contributions by aromatic stacking interactions.

Structural Overview Riboflavin synthases from E. coli and B. subtilis are both homotrimers in solution as shown by hydrodynamic studies [23, 24]. The crystal structure of the ligand-free enzyme of E. coli has been reported [10]. The enzyme is an asymmetric trimer with the subunits related to one another by rotations of 124 , 85 , and 151 . Trimerization occurs principally via the C-terminal helices, but does not lead to a symmetrical structure. The recombinant

6-Carboxyethyl-7-Oxo-8-Ribityllumazine Binding to the N-Terminal Barrel The lumazine chromophore of 8 in the N-terminal barrel is exclusively involved in hydrophilic interactions (Figure 3A). The strictly conserved active site residue, His102, the only aromatic residue in the N-terminal active site, forms only a hydrogen bond by its side chain to the oxo substituent at position 7 of the lumazine ring. The peptide amide groups of Ala64 and Thr50 are oriented toward the O2 and O4 carbonyl groups of the ligand ° ° lumazine ring at distances of 2.7 A and 2.9 A, respectively. In addition, the side chain oxygen atom of Thr50 is involved in a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the imido group N5 of the ring system. The carbonyl oxygen of Gly62 is strongly hydrogen bonded to the N3-imide hydrogen atom of the CEOL inhibitor at a distance of ° 2.7 A. The side chain oxygen -O of Ser67 is involved in an additional hydrophilic interaction to the O2 carbonyl group and further in a hydrogen bond interaction to the OH3 hydroxyl group of the ribityl side chain of the lumazine ring system. The next ribityl hydroxyl group OH4 is hydrogen bonded to the main chain amide group of Val103. The residues Val103 and His102 take part in 8 binding from the following C barrel of the S. pombe riboflavin synthase monomer. The distance between the

° thiol group of Cys48 and carbon atom 6 of 8 is 4.0 A (Figure 3C). 6-Carboxyethyl-7-Oxo-8-Ribityllumazine Binding to the C-Terminal Barrel The binding arrangement of 8 in the C barrel is almost the same as for the N-terminal barrel mentioned above (Figure 3B). The two aromatic residues, Tyr139 and Tyr164, interact with the bound ligand via hydrogen bonds to the carboxyethyl substituent at position 6 of the lumazine derivative and its ribityl side chain, respectively. The peptide amide groups of Ile162 and Thr148 are in hydrogen-bonding distance with the O2 and O4 carbonyl groups of the ligand lumazine system. The active site residue Thr148 of the C barrel is in the same topological position as the corresponding Thr50 of the

N-terminal barrel and establishes identical hydrogen bonds. The carbonyl oxygen of Met160 is strongly hydrogen bonded to the N3-imide hydrogen atom of the ° inhibitor at a distance of 2.7 A. Ser67 of the N-terminal barrel is replaced by the corresponding Thr165. In the C-terminal barrel, Thr165 is hydrogen bonded to the O2 carbonyl group. Corresponding to the N-terminal barrel, the OH3 hydroxyl group of the ribityl side chain of the lumazine ligand is in hydrogen-bonding distance to the -O atom of Thr165. Only the active site residue Val6 of the adjacent N-terminal barrel is involved with the main chain amide group in a hydrogen contact to the ribityl hydroxyl group OH4 of the bound CEOL in the C barrel of the S. pombe riboflavin synthase monomer. Whereas most amino acid residues in direct contact with the lumazine chromophore are identical at the N- and C-ter-

minal binding sites, the amino acid topologically equivalent to cysteine 48 of the N barrel is the serine residue 146 of the N barrel. Discussion The benzenoid ring of riboflavin originates in a most unusual way by dismutation of the pteridine derivative 1. The available information on the reaction mechanism can be summarized as follows. (1) The enzyme-catalyzed reaction requires no organic cofactors and no metal ions [15]. (2) The reaction can proceed in the absence of a catalyst in neutral or acidic aqueous solution [16­18]. (3) The pentacyclic lumazine dimer 4 fulfills the criteria for a kinetically competent reaction intermediate [8]. (4) The pentacyclic intermediate can be cleaved by riboflavin synthase to yield either riboflavin (6) and the pyrimidine 7 or two molecules of the riboflavin synthase substrate 1. (5) An isotope effect of 5.0 has been found for [6 -2 H3]6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine [5]. Hence, the release of a proton(s) from the position 6 methyl group could involve a relatively high energy barrier. Riboflavin synthase of bacteria and yeasts, including S. pombe, are homotrimeric proteins in solution. The quaternary structure of the S. pombe enzyme in solution is not affected by the ligand 8, the ligand used in the present crystallographic study (our unpublished data). Hence, the monomer structure found in the crystals must be due to the crystallization buffer, most probably by the organic solvent used as precipitant. The riboflavin synthase subunit folds into two domains ° with closely similar folding topology (0.97 A rmsd in case of the S. pombe enzyme; Figure 2). This had been anticipated on the basis of sequence arguments [9] and

has been confirmed by X-ray structure analysis of riboflavin synthase of E. coli (without bound ligand) [10] and of S. pombe (with bound ligand). In the crystals of the S. pombe protein, the two folding domains are related by a noncrystallographic pseudo-c2 symmetry axis with a rotation angle of 176.2 (Figure 4B). Both domains of the S. pombe protein can bind one molecule of the enzyme inhibitor, 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo8-ribityllumazine, in shallow cavities lined by hydrophilic groups. The conformations of the ligand molecules bound to the N- and C-terminal domains are closely similar. The amino acid residues in contact with the bound ligand are also closely similar. The major difference is a cysteine residue (position 48 in the N-terminal domain) being replaced by a serine residue (position 146 in the C-terminal domain). Both amino acids are absolutely conserved in all putative riboflavin synthase paralogs. Nevertheless, serine 146 of the S. pombe enzyme can be replaced by alanine with only a minor impact on enzyme activity. Replacement of cysteine 48 by serine reduces the activity by a factor of five, but replacement by alanine affords a soluble protein whose activity, if any, is below the level of detection (our unpublished data). It should also be noted that mutant genes specifying E. coli riboflavin synthase mutants carrying alanine or serine instead of cysteine 48 (corresponding to cysteine 48 of the S. pombe enzyme) could not be expressed in recombinant E. coli strains [28]. Distances of the side chain heteroatom of cysteine 48 and serine 146 to atoms of the bound enzyme inhibitors are shown in Figures 3C and 3D. The closest neighbor of the thiol ° group is the 6 -methylene group of the ligand (3.7 A). The folding topologies of the E. coli and S. pombe enzymes are closely similar (Figure 6). Moreover, the

amino acids in direct contact with the bound ligand are identical or very similar in the E. coli enzyme (Figure 7). Therefore, the lumazine analog could be modeled easily from the S. pombe structure to all six binding sites of the E. coli enzyme (Figure 4C). The E. coli riboflavin synthase is devoid of trigonal symmetry [10]. Trimerization occurs via the C-terminal helices. Only the N-terminal domain of one subunit has extended contacts with the C barrel domain of a second subunit. Only in one out of three potential active sites, two subunits are in close contact and form an active site with pseudo-c2 symmetry (Figure 8), where the substrate molecules are ideally positioned for the dismutation reaction. Indirect evidence for the nonsymmetrical character of riboflavin synthases had been obtained earlier by protein perturbation experiments using fluorinated pteridine derivatives which were monitored by 19F NMR [12, 13, 28, 29]. Multiple 19F NMR signals were observed for trifluoromethyl groups of enzyme-bound ligands, which were best explained by the hypothesis that the ligand

molecules are bound in different environments. Recent NMR experiments with the S. pombe enzyme gave similar results (our unpublished data). We conclude that the asymmetry observed with the unliganded E. coli riboflavin synthase persists in the presence of ligands. The protein perturbation studies are well in line with the hypothesis of major dynamic motions in the homotrimeric protein which could bring N- and C-terminal domains of different subunits into the appropriate spatial relationship for substrate dimerization. The crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme would then have to be interpreted as a snapshot of a specific conformation which is stabilized by crystal contacts. In order to analyze the reaction mechanism in closer detail, we replaced the inhibitor molecules in Figure 9A (1) by the substrate 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (Figure 9B) and (2) by the pentacyclic reaction intermediate 4 (Figure 9C). The stereochemistry of the pentacyclic intermediates has not been determined hitherto. It appears plausible that the dimerization of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine

should result in syn linkage of the ring systems of donor molecule 1a and receptor molecule 1b (Figure 1). Of the two diastereomers (6*R;7*S) and (6*S;7*R), only (6*R;7*S) (Figure 3E) fits into the cavity formed at the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains of subunits A and C of the E. coli enzyme. The result of a dynamics simulation described in Experimental Procedures is shown in Figure 9C. The pentacyclic substrate dimer fits closely into the putative active site of S. pombe riboflavin synthase generated with the coordinates of the E. coli enzyme [10]. Upon enzymatic cleavage of the dimer, the resulting riboflavin would be bound to the N-terminal domain, and the pyrimidine product would be bound to the C-terminal domain. In other words, the lumazine molecule originally bound to

the N-terminal domain is the four-carbon acceptor and the substrate bound to the C-terminal domain is the four-carbon donor. With this in mind, the thiolate group of cysteine 48 may act as a base which abstracts a proton from the 6 -methylene group in the hypothetical reaction intermediate 4 and/or 5. However, it should be noted that the catalytic activity of the enzyme is only reduced 6-fold by replacement of cysteine 48 with serine, although the KA values of cysteine and serine differ by at least five orders of magnitude. The serine residue 146 could act as the nucleophile X proposed by Plaut and Beach [3]. However, it is also possible that this function could be assumed by a water molecule, since the reaction can proceed without enzyme

catalysis. This would fit the observation that, although serine 146 appears to be absolutely conserved, it can be replaced with only minor impact on catalytic rate. Plaut and Beach proposed an elegant hypothesis suggesting that the hydroxyl group of the position 8 ribityl side chain of 2 could act as a nucleophile attacking position 7 of the pteridine system under formation of a tricyclic reaction intermediate [30]. Indeed, the formation of tricyclic lumazine anion structures has been shown in solution [31­33]. The X-ray structure of the S. pombe enzyme shows the ribityl side chains of both substrate molecules to be bound strongly in an extended conformation. This appears inconsistent with the proposed tricyclic anion intermediate. On the contrary, the polyol side chains of both substrate molecules are likely to retain an extended conformation throughout the complex reaction trajectory. Biological Implications Riboflavin synthase performs an unusual dismutation reaction in which two identical substrate molecules serve as donor (1a) or acceptor (1b) of a four-carbon

unit. Previous structural analysis [10] and NMR studies (our unpublished data) [9, 23, 24] revealed a markedly nonsymmetric trimeric state of riboflavin synthase. Our modeling experiments, based on the inhibitor-bound protein, strongly suggest that the close intersubunit contact of the trimer as seen in the crystals of the E. coli protein is indeed in an active conformation and capable of supporting the dismutation reaction. Therefore, this trimer very likely represents a distinct functional state. As there is no reason to suggest a static asymmetric ensemble, it appears likely that thermal fluctuation or substrate binding converts the three different intersubunit contacts into one another, retaining an asymmetric trimer. We demonstrate here that the reaction is achieved by binding the substrate molecules in a pseudo-c2 symmetric environment, where the C-terminal domain acts as donor site and the N-terminal domain as acceptor site. In addition, the geometry of the active site allows us to suggest the stereochemistry of the pentacyclic intermediate 4. The enzymes of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway are essential enzymes in enterobacteria or yeasts as a

consequence of the apparent absence of a flavin uptake system. Therefore, riboflavin synthase itself is a potential target for anti-infective drugs. The detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism could reveal new insights for the development of mechanism-based enzyme inhibitors designed for therapeutic application. The pseudoc2 symmetric active site allows the design of inhibitors that link the donor and acceptor domains with a single inhibitor as a novel strategy for inhibitor design [29].
Experimental Procedures Materials 6-Carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine was prepared by published procedures [34]. Recombinant riboflavin synthase of S. pombe was prepared (our unpublished data). Crystallization Crystals of S. pombe riboflavin synthase in complex with 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine of maximal dimensions 0.2 mm 0.05 mm 0.05 mm grew within a few days by sitting drop vapor diffusion

against a 0.3 ml reservoir solution containing 0.1 M bicine (pH 9.0) and 65% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). Droplets were composed of 2 l enzyme solution (9 mg/ml of 20 mM Tris hydrochloride [pH 7.0], containing 100 mM potassium chloride and a 10 molar excess of solid 8) and 2 l of reservoir buffer. For data collection, these cocrystals could be frozen at 100 K in reservoir buffer serving as a cryoprotectant due to its high content of MPD. Data Collection and Structure Solution Native X-ray data (NATI) for the inhibitor-bound wild-type enzyme were collected on a MAR Research 345 imaging plate detector system mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode operated at ° 50 mA and 100 kV with CuK 1.542 A under cryogenic condi° tions. The X-ray intensities were evaluated up to 2.7 A by using the MOSFLM [35] program package. The crystals complexed with 8 ° belong to the space group P61 with cell constants a b 70.32 A, ° c 92.37 A. The asymmetric unit contained one monomer resulting ° in a Matthews coefficient of 3.0 A3 /Da [36] with a solvent content of 59%. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the cocrystals at room temperature either in 2 mM thiomersal (C9H9HgNaO2S) for 2 hr or incubation with tantalum bromide (Ta6Br12 ) overnight. The corresponding derivatives and double derivatives were analyzed by difference Patterson methods and cross-phased difference Fourier maps with MLPHARE [37]. Anomalous data (DERI) for MAD phasing were collected from a single cross-phased characterized mercury heavy atom cocrystal at the DESY synchrotron source beamline BW6 (Hamburg, Germany) employing a MAR Research CCD detector. The derivatized cocrystal was frozen at 100 K, with the mother liquor serving as a cryoprotec° tant. The MAD data up to 2.1 A were measured at Hg-K absorption ° ° edges f (1.010 A) and f (1.000 A) and the remote wavelength at ° 0.9499 A. Complete data sets were recorded in rotation frames of 0.5 per angular range of 90 followed by a continuous set of 90 for measured Friedel pairs in inverse beam geometry. All data sets were integrated and scaled with the HKL package [38] and further processed using programs from the CCP4 suite [39]. Data collection statistics are shown in Table 1. One mercury position could be confirmed in anomalous difference Patterson maps and was used for initial phasing with MLPHARE [37]. Phases were improved by solvent flattening and density modification. The experimental MAD map had an overall figure of merit of 0.55 (Table 2) and allowed tracing of most of the polypeptide chain, including side chains. Examination of the packing indicated reasonable crystal contacts between the riboflavin synthase monomers without overlap of symmetry-related molecules. Model Building and Refinement Model building was carried out with the program MAIN [40]. The initial model was subjected to rigid body and positional refinement using CNS [41]. After several cycles of manual rebuilding, positional

and B factor refinement and two rounds of simulated annealing water molecules were incorporated automatically into the S. pombe ° riboflavin synthase model at 2.1 A resolution. The progress of all refinement procedures was monitored by using 10% of the reflections to calculate a free R value (Rfree). A geometry check using the program PROCHECK [42] revealed that 86.0% and 14.0% of all nonglycine residues lie within the most favored and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively (Table 1) [43]. Molecular Modeling Using SYBYL modeling software [44], two substrate molecules, 6,7dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (1) and the reaction intermediate 4, were generated and modeled into the proposed active site formed by

two adjacent S. pombe riboflavin synthase monomers. This active dimer was generated by superposition of S. pombe riboflavin synthase monomers on the crystal structure of the E. coli trimer (1I8D). Correct atom types, stereocenters, hybridization states, and bond types were defined, and Gasteiger-Huckel charges were assigned ¨ ° to each atom. A spherical subset of 8 A radius around compound 4 was defined and energy minimized using the Powell method and the Tripos force field. The remaining protein was treated as rigid body during energy minimization. Analysis and Graphical Representation Stereochemical parameters were assessed with PROCHECK [42]. Protein structures were aligned three-dimensionally by TOP3D [39], and
