We studied the interaction of hematopoietic cell kinase SH3 domain (HckSH3) with an artificial 12-residue proline-rich peptide PD1 (HSKYPLPPLPSL) identified as high affinity ligand (KD = 0.2 M). PD1 shows an unusual ligand sequence for SH3 binding in type I orientation because it lacks the typical basic anchor residue at position P-3, but instead has a tyrosine residue at this position. A basic lysine residue, however, is present at position P-4. The solution structure of the HckSH3: PD1 complex, which is the first HckSH3 complex structure available, clearly reveals that the P-3 tyrosine residue of PD1 does not take the position of the typical anchor residue but rather forms additional van der Waals interactions with the HckSH3 RT loop. Instead, lysine at position P-4 of PD1 substitutes the function of the P-3 anchor residue. This finding expands the well known ligand consensus sequence +xxPpxP by +xxxPpxP. Thus, software tools like iSPOT fail to identify PD1 as a high-affinity HckSH3 ligand so far. In addition, a short antiparallel -sheet in the RT loop of HckSH3 is observed upon PD1 binding. The structure of the HckSH3:PD1 complex reveals novel features of SH3 ligand binding and yields new insights into the structural basics of SH3­ligand interactions. Consequences for computational prediction tools adressing SH3­ligand interactions as well as the biological relevance of our findings are discussed.

kinase expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells of myeloid and B-lymphoid origin.1,2 Hck has been shown to be involved in myeloid cell growth, differentiation, and function. It has been identified as a signaling component of numerous receptor pathways including FcR 3 (FcRI, 4 FcRII 5 ), Integrins6,7 and Cytokine-mediated signal transduction (IL-2,8 IL-3,9 LIF/IL-610, GM-CSF11). Hck is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, 12­14 apoptosis,15,16 gene transcription,17 regulation of K + -channels 18 as well as phagocytosis and degranulation.19­22 It plays an important role in Bcr/Abl-induced leukemia23 and in HIV disease. It binds to HIV-1 Nef24 resulting in an increase of Hck kinase activity in vitro25 and in vivo.26 It also binds to HIV-1 Vif, which counteracts cellular activities that would otherwise limit HIV-1 replication by suppressing kinase activity.27 According to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot family/ domain classification, the human Src-type proteintyrosine kinase family includes at least ten more members (Blk, Brk, Fgr, Frk, Fyn, Lck, Lyn, Src, Srm,

1518 Yes) in addition to Hck. They all consist of four consecutive domains, an amino-terminal "unique" domain, an SH3 and an SH2 domain, which is separated by a short SH2-kinase linker region from the catalytic kinase domain that has a short carboxyterminal regulatory tail. Three-dimensional structures are known for SH3, SH2 and kinase domains of Hck,28­31 as well as for various other tyrosine kinases. The Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which binds left-handed poly-proline type II (PPII) helices, is known to affect the localization of the protein32 and recruit possible target proteins to the catalytic domain.33,34 The SH3 domain negatively regulates kinase activity,35,36 and mutations in the domain frequently result in constitutively active kinases.37,38 HIV-1 Nef, on the other hand, stimulates the kinase activity by binding to the SH3 domain. The regulatory functions of the highly conserved SH2 and SH3 domains result from intramolecular interactions shown in the crystal structures of inactive Src and Hck.39,28 Intramolecular binding of a phosphorylated tyrosine residue at the carboxyterminal tail to the SH2 domain rearranges the SH2kinase linker region, which then binds via its PPII helix to the SH3 domain. This interaction results in an intramolecular structural rearrangement at the active site of the kinase domain, which becomes inaccessible for substrates and the kinase activity is inhibited. Recently, we have identified an artificial peptide (PD1) to be a high affinity HckSH3 ligand (KD = 0.2 M) from screening a phage displayed peptide library against the closely related lymphocyte specific kinase (Lck) SH3 domain.40 Compared to typical class I ligands, the PD1 amino acid sequence shows some unusual features. A basic residue is found at position P-4 and not at the typical anchor position P-3, where it contains a hydrophobic tyrosine instead. We determined the solution structure of the HckSH3:PD1 complex to elucidate the structural basis of the high affinity of PD1 to HckSH3.

Results
Determination of the dissociation constant between PD1 and HckSH3 and mapping of the PD1 binding site To obtain the dissociation constant (KD) of the phage display selected peptide PD1 to HckSH3, fluorescence titrations were carried out.41,42 The resulting KD value was determined to be 0.23 M (Table 1). To elucidate further details of PD1 binding to HckSH3, we employed chemical shift perturbation mapping by NMR spectroscopy. Observation of chemical shift changes () in a protein upon ligand binding is a sensitive method for measuring the strength of an interaction and for defining the protein's interaction surface. 43,44 Thus, 1 H- 15 Nheteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of 300 M 15N-labeled HckSH3 were recorded with increasing amounts of PD1 peptide (Figure 1(a)). During PD1 peptide titration of HckSH3, followed by 1 H-15N-HSQC NMR spectra, 50 of 91 amide resonances of the unbound state of HckSH3 disappeared without shifting while at the same time new resonances of these amide groups appeared at different chemical shift values that belong to the PD1-bound state of HckSH3. This is in accordance with the low KD value of this complex obtained by fluorescence titration. Amide resonances of H65, N66, E89, H92 and H93 of unliganded HckSH3 could not be observed. Addition of PD1 resulted in the appearance of these amide resonances except for H93 (Figure 1(a)). Figure 1(b)­(d) shows plots of chemical shift changes between unliganded and PD1-bound HckSH3. The most prominent changes of the chemical shifts were found within three distinct stretches of the HckSH3 peptide chain, namely residues in the RT loop (E94, D95), the n-Src loop (E109-W114), which builds the specificity region of the HckSH3 binding surface, and residues in the 310 helix (I127, S129, N130).

The secondary structure elements are represented below the histograms.

Solution structure of the HckSH3:PD1 complex We have determined the solution structure of human Hck SH3 domain comprising residues 60 to 140 complexed with the PD1 peptide ligand using 13 C and 15 N-edited multidimensional NMR techniques. Nearly complete 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shift assignments have been achieved. The 1 H chemical shift assignment of unlabeled PD1 peptide and intermolecular interproton nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) have been carried out using multidimensional filter experiments. A set of 100 conformers were calculated using the torsion angle dynamics simulation program DYANA. The set was calculated using a total of 2500 NOE-derived distance restraints. A total of 2031 distance restraints result from intramolecular NOEs of the SH3 domain, 115 distance restraints from the PD1 peptide and 354 distance restraints are of intermolecular origin. No long-range and only a few medium-range interproton NOEs were observed for the N and C termini (residue 60 to 78 and 137 to 140) of the SH3 construct, implicating that these regions are largely unstructured. In the following we use the one-letter amino acid code for the HckSH3 residues and the three-letter amino acid code for the residues of the PD1 peptide. Figure 2(a) shows the superposition of the 20 lowest energy conformers. A ribbon diagram of a representative conformer is shown in Figure 2(b).

The 20 conformers calculated for the HckSH3:PD1 complex show deviations among the N and Cterminal regions of HckSH3, and in the loop regions, while the residues involved in secondary structure formation are well defined. The residues 6 to 10 of the PD1 peptide containing the xPxxP-motif are extremely well defined (Figure 2(a)). Intermolecular NOE-derived restraints are found for residues in the RT and n-Src loops as well as in the 310 helix, especially to peptide residues of the xP-dipeptides Leu6/Pro7 and Leu9/Pro10 but also to the Nterminal amino acids (see Supplementary Data for details). The solution structure of HckSH3 domain in complex with PD1 shows a -barrel conformation, typical for SH3 domains. It contains two orthogonal -sheets consisting of three antiparallel -strands with the b-strand shared between the two sheets. The subdivision of the b-strand is marked by the strong amide proton NOEs between L107 and E108, which arise from a -bulge at L107. Thus, the first sheet consists of strands a, b1 and e, the second one of b2, c and d (see Kohda et al.45 for nomenclature). The a, b, c and d-strands are separated by three loops, the RT, the n-Src and the distal loop, respectively. Strands d and e are separated by a short 310 helix. A new feature in the structure of complexed HckSH3 is a short but well defined antiparallel -sheet within the RT loop, which arises from two hydrogen bonds between

1520 backbone amide group and carbonyl oxygens of residues Y88 and F98 (Figure 2(b)). The chemical shift deviations (Figure 1(b)­(d)) are mapped in the surface representation of the

HckSH3:PD1 complex in Figure 2(c). The largest chemical shift deviations arise from residues located in the HckSH3 specificity pocket built of the n-Src and RT loops as well as residues from the 310 helix. H2O/2H2O exchange experiments The HckSH3 domain exhibits a more flexible RT loop region than other SH3 domains and this flexibility seems to be important for the specific binding to ligands as assumed for the binding to HIV-1 Nef.30 The RT loop of free HckSH3 is absent from regular secondary structure elements,29,30 but structure calculation for the HckSH3:PD1 complex yielded a short antiparallel -sheet that is characterized by the formation of two hydrogen bonds between the backbone amide and carbonyl groups of the residues Y88 and F98. To investigate the flexibility of the RT loop in free and complexed HckSH3, H2O/2H2O exchange experiments for free and PD1-bound HckSH3 were carried out (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3(a) and (b), amide protons with increased lifetimes coincide well with -sheets and hydrogen bonds therein. PD1 binding does not only result in longer exchange lifetimes inside the -sheet regions, especially within the a-strand, but also in the N and C-terminal regions of the RT loop (Figure 3(c)). Increased amide proton lifetimes upon ligand binding were also reported elsewhere.29,46 Most of the residues with increased lifetimes are not directly located at the ligand binding interface, indicating that the stabilization upon PD1 binding propagates through the whole HckSH3 structure as already suggested for the AblSH3 domain upon binding of p41.47 The increase of amide proton lifetimes in the RT loop, also for the residues Y88 and F98 in the complexed state indicates some loss of RT loop flexibility upon complex formation. Thus, PD1 ligand binding stabilizes existing hydrogen bonds and induces additional hydrogen bonds, resulting in the creation of a short regular -sheet within the HckSH3 RT loop region.

1521 conserved acidic residue within the SH3 compass pocket and determines the binding orientation of the ligand.48 The specificity of SH3 domains to their ligands seems to arise from residues located "downstream" (around P-6) of the anchor residue. Those residues interact with less well conserved residues of the RT and n-Src loop.48­53 In the HckSH3:PD1 complex PD1 adopts a type-I binding orientation with its N terminus directed to the SH3 domain compass pocket. The critical proline residues Pro7 and Pro10 correspond to positions P0 and P3, while the two leucine residues Leu6 and Leu9 occupy positions P-1 and P2 (nomenclature54). The PD1 peptide adopts a PPII-helix conformation between residues Leu6 to Pro10. These residues adopt the typical  and -angles of a poly-proline type II helix (-78° and +146°, respectively55). The helical conformation is terminated at residue Pro5, which lies above the conserved tryptophan residue W113. This tryptophan residue separates the hydrophobic poly-proline binding sites from the compass pocket and is known to disturb the PPIIconformation.56 The peptide backbone is kinked at this position and the N-terminal part of PD1 (residues 1­4) adheres to the SH3 surface in an Sshaped fashion (Figure 4(a)). Peptide residue His1 (peptide position P-6) is flanked by the n-Src and the RT loop and is packed against a hydrophobic pocket build by the sidechains of H92, H93, W113, and Y126. The backbone amide nitrogen of His1 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of W113. The conformation of the side-chain of His1 is not well defined. Only some intermolecular NOEs between the His1 backbone protons and the side-chain of Y126 were detected. The short side-chain of Ser2 (P-5) is situated in the cleft between peptide backbone and n-Src loop residues S110 and E112, and points towards the side-chain of the latter residue. The basic side-chain of Lys3 (P-4) points towards the compass pocket. However, due to a lack of intermolecular NOEs between side-chain protons of Lys3 and protons of HckSH3 residues which causes a lack in distance constraints, this side-chain is not well defined in the complex structure. Nevertheless, amongst 20 calculated conformers, some yielded the side-chain of Lys3 to be within the compass pocket. This suggests that there is no steric hindrance for the Lys3 side-chain to bind into the compass pocket and to interact with the acidic compass residue D95 or with residue E94 in the RT loop (Figure 4(b)). Additionally, a structure calculation containing additional constraints defining a salt-bridge between the side-chain amino group of Lys3 and the side-chain carbonyl group of D95 also did not yield additional distance or van-der-Waals constraint violations. Involvement of the carboxyl group of either D95 or E94 in a salt-bridge with the epsilon-amino group of Lys3 should lead to a significant change of the side-chain carbonyl carbon chemical shift of D95 or E94. Thus, we performed a two-dimensional H(C)

Description of the HckSH3:PD1 binding region Usually, the core motif recognized by SH3 domains is of the consensus sequence xPxxP and adopts a PPII helix conformation. Due to the pseudosymmetric character of the PPII helix, proline-rich peptides can bind to the SH3 domains in two orientations. For SH3 domains of Src-type, ligands with class I orientation are of the consensus sequence +pxPpxP (+ = basic residue, mostly arginine; P = invariant proline; p = proline preferred), while the consensus sequence of class II orientation is xPpxPp+.48,49 The two xP-dipeptide parts contact hydrophobic pockets while the basic residue at position P-3 (anchor position) contacts a highly

The Lys3 side-chain position upon structure calculation employing additional constraints describing a salt-bridge between Lys3 and D95 is highlighted in orange. (c) View on the RT loop regions of the HckSH3:PD1 and the FynSH3:3BP2 (PDB code 1FYN59) complexes. Superposition is based on optimal fitting of the C coordinates within the -sheets. The conserved tryptophan (HckSH3 residue W113) and proline side-chains as well as the tyrosine side-chain within the 310 helix (HckSH3 residue Y131) are coloured in blue and orange for HckSH3 and FynSH3, respectively. The conserved tryptophan residue in the FynSH3 complex structure (W119) is known to adopt a SH3-I orientation.58 Compared to Fyn W119, the plane of the HckSH3 W113 side-chain is tilted by about 12° towards the conserved proline residue, indicating a SH3-II orientation for W113 in the HckSH3:PD1 complex structure.

CO2 experiment57 to determine the chemical shifts of the side-chain carbonyl carbon atoms of D95 and E94. The resonance of the H-CO correlation of E94 could not be assigned because of a strong overlap of many glutamatic acid residue resonances. The respective resonance of the H-CO correlation of D95 could only be detected for the free HckSH3, but not in the PD1-bound HckSH3. Although this prevented us from determining the side-chain carbonyl carbon chemical shift change of D95 upon PD1 binding, the disappearing resonance could indicate D95's involvement in exchange processes that are not present to this extent in the unliganded HckSH3. Whether this is due to involvement of D95 in salt-bridge formation or to other direct or indirect interactions with PD1, cannot be determined definitely. The aromatic side-chain of Tyr4 (P-3) covers a hydrophobic patch built from the side-chains of W113, H92, H93 and I91. It interacts via van der Waals interactions with the imidazole ring of H92. Thus, in the HckSH3:PD1 complex the H92 sidechain adopts a fixed position within the SH3 compass pocket as compared with its flexible behaviour in unliganded HckSH3. The carbonyl ox-

ygen of Tyr4 is involved in two hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond with the indole nitrogen of W113 is typical for ligands with PPII-helix conformation. The hydrogen bond with the amino nitrogen of Leu6 contributes to the stabilisation of the kink at Pro5, where the N-terminal residues of the peptide backbone change from helical conformation to a more extended one. Residue Leu6 (P-1) packs with its side-chain into a hydrophobic xP-dipeptide binding pocket formed by W113, P128/Y131 and Y88/I91/H95 of the n-Src loop, the 310-helix and the RT loop, respectively. Its side-chain is situated between the S129 and N130 side-chains of the 310 helix and the E112 side-chain of the n-Src loop. The side-chain of Pro7 (P0) occupies the same hydrophobic xP-dipeptide binding pocket as that of Leu6. The side-chain of N130 is positioned between Leu6 and Leu9 pointing towards Pro7. The amino nitrogen of N130 is involved in a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Pro7. The side-chain of Pro8 (P+1) points away from the SH3 binding surface. The side-chain of I91 is situated between Pro7 and Pro8, making hydrophobic contacts to the side-chains of the two peptide residues.

1523 peptides to a set of different SH3 domains, and found that most of the KD values were higher than 10 M.61 Thus, the KD value for HckSH3 (about 0.2 M) ranks among the highest affinity ligands reported so far for short chemically unmodified proline-rich peptides. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of PD1 shows some unusual features of a Src-type SH3 domain ligand. The basic residue is situated at position P-4 instead of the anchor position P-3, where a tyrosine is present. In order to structurally characterize this interaction and to confirm the high affinity of PD1 to HckSH3 we employed NMR spectroscopy. The NMR chemical shift pertubation experiments reveal a slow exchange relative to the NMR timescale between free and bound state of HckSH3 upon addition of peptide PD1 (Figure 1(a)). Intensities of most of the amide resonances in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra disappeared during ongoing titration without shifting while new resonances appeared as a result of complex formation. The NMR titration experiment thus confirmed the high affinity of PD1 peptide to HckSH3 domain as obtained from fluorescence titration experiments. Comparison of the HckSH3:PD1 complex to other HckSH3 structures Up to now, high resolution structural information of the HckSH3 domain in complex with peptide ligands was not available. Thus, a comparison of the HckSH3:PD1 complex is only possible with the solution structure of unliganded HckSH3 domain (PDB code 4HCK29), and with crystal structures of unliganded (PDB code 1BU130) and intramolecularly complexed HckSH3 domain (PDB code 1AD5;28 PDB code 1QCF31). The comparison shows a high degree of similarity and congruent arrangement of secondary structure elements across nearly the entire SH3 domain sequence (see Supplementary Data). Overall, the backbone deviations of the HckSH3: PD1 complex compared to the four HckSH3 structures are small and arise mainly from differences in the RT loop and, to a smaller extent, from the 310 helix, the n-Src and the distal loop (Figure 5(a)­(d)). Interestingly, the HckSH3:PD1 structure shows higher similarity to the crystal structures than to the NMR-derived 4HCK structure, particularly in the RT loop region. However, distinct differences do exist between PD1 bound HckSH3 and the other HckSH3 structures. The RT loop of PD1 bound HckSH3 is located closer to the peptide binding site, and the side-chain of H92 is packed onto the compass pocket. These properties of the PD1-bound HckSH3 are very likely due to the unusual binding mode of the PD1 peptide. In addition, none of the HckSH3 structures reported so far exhibits the short -sheet in the RT loop (Figure 5(e)). Since no additional structural data of ligandbound HckSH3 exist, it is not clear, whether the induction of a RT loop -sheet is a unique feature of PD1-liganded HckSH3 or a general property of

The side-chains of Leu9 (P+2) and Pro10 (P+3) share a second hydrophobic xP-binding pocket between the RT loop and the 310 helix of the SH3 domain. This pocket is formed by the side-chains of Y131 of the 310 helix and Y86 of the RT loop. The side-chains of Pro5 (P-2) and Ser11 (P+4) are oriented towards the solvent. Additionally, no intermolecular NOEs were found for Ser11. Leu12 (P+5) shows some weak intermolecular NOEs to the side-chain of Y86. No medium or long range NOEs were found for Ser11 and Leu12, resulting in large RMSD values for these side-chains in the 20 calculated conformers. It is obvious that PD1 comprises the consensus motif LPx(L/A)P (with a leucine preferred at P2), found in SH3 class I ligands. It is known that the orientation of a conserved tryptophan in the SH3 domain, SH3-I or SH3-II, determines the selective specificity of a given SH3 domain for binding to ligands of class I and class II/class I, respectively. Despite a type I ligand orientation, PPII helix conformation of class I ligand shows a higher similarity to that of class II ligands with the leucine residues occupying the same binding pocket positions as the proline residues do in class II binding.58 As illustrated by the superposition of the SH3 domains from the HckSH3:PD1 and the FynSH3: 3BP2 complex (PDB code 1FYN59), upon binding of PD1 we found W113 of HckSH3 in SH3-II conformation, supporting the binding of PD1 as class I ligand (Figure 4(c)). Interaction of modified PD1 peptides with HckSH3 Normally, position P-3 of SH3 domain ligands of Src-type is occupied by a basic residue (mostly arginine60). To elucidate whether binding affinity of PD1 could be enhanced by a basic residue at P-3, we measured the affinity of a modified peptide PD1-Y(-3)R (HSKRPLPPLPSL), carrying an arginine instead of P -3 tyrosine to HckSH3 by fluorescence titration experiments (Table 1). Interestingly, peptide PD1-Y(-3)R shows a twofold lower affinity to HckSH3 as PD1, suggesting a preference of HckSH3 for tyrosine at position P-3. We also measured the binding affinities of PD1-Y (-3)A and PD1-K(-4)A, both carrying an alanine instead of P-3 tyrosine or P-4 lysine, respectively. In comparison to PD1, the higher KD values for the HckSH3 further highlight the importance of residues Tyr4 and to a lesser extent, Lys3 (Table 1).

Discussion
PD1 binds to HckSH3 in the upper nanomolar range Fluorescence titrations of HckSH3 with peptide PD1 yielded an extremely low dissociation constant in the upper nanomolar range (Table 1). Others examined the affinity of thousands of SH3-binding

rich region of the GTPase activating protein29 show a similar increase in the amide proton lifetimes of the RT loop as for the HckSH3­PD1 interaction, indicating a loss of flexibility in this region. Residues 5 to 10 of PD1 bind to HckSH3 like a class I ligand Peptide PD1 contains the core consensus LPx (L/A)P motif described for SH3 class I ligands.58 As expected, PD1 binds to HckSH3 in type I orientation. PD1 residues 5 to 10 adopt a class I binding conformation, which is defined by the SH3II conformation of the W113 side-chain in the HckSH3:PD1 complex. In contrast, the plane of the W113 side-chain is tilted by about 16° towards the 310 helix in all crystal structures. Thus, all HckSH3 crystal structures show the side-chain of W113 to adopt a SH3-I conformation (Figure 5(e)). Interestingly, the unliganded HckSH3 solution structure yielded the W113 side-chain to be in SH3-II conformation in accordance with the PD1 bound HckSH3 structure. Peptide residues Leu6 to Pro10 adopt a PPII helix conformation with typical  and  angles. The Cterminal PD1 residues Ser11 and Leu12 did not reveal experimental contacts to HckSH3. The amino-terminal residues 1 to 4 are responsible for the unusual binding mode of PD1 The four N-terminal PD1 residues attach to the SH3 surface in an S-shaped fashion generating various interactions of hydrophobic and electrostatic origin. While the backbone amide nitrogen of His1 (P-6) is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of W113, the side-chain of His1 does not seem to contribute to the complex formation. The Nterminal peptide backbone adheres to the valley between n-Src and RT loop. The side-chain of Lys3, positioned at P-4, points towards the compass pocket of HckSH3. Lysine instead of an arginine anchor residue is not unusual for SH3 ligands, as demonstrated by natural HckSH3 ligands like Vif (KKIKPPLP27) or Btk (KKPLPPLP62). The formation of a salt-bridge between the sidechains of Lys3 and D95 or E94 could not be unambiguously validated in the HckSH3:PD1 complex. Such experimental difficulties are known also from other examples, e.g. the Fyn SH3 domain in

Structure of Hck SH3 Domain Ligand Complex

1525 Based on ITC experiments, Arold and co-workers claim that not the salt-bridge formation, but the positive electrostatic charge of the basic anchor residue is important for binding.30 It is assumed that the preference of Src-type SH3 ligands for basic residues at position P-3 is caused by locating and orienting effects between the ligand and the respective SH3 domain prior to the binding event. If Lys3 has the role of an anchor residue in PD1, then irrespective of whether Lys3 forms a saltbridge or not, replacement of Lys3 with an alanine should significantly decrease HckSH3 affinity. Indeed, the ten-fold increase of the KD value for HckSH3-PD1 interaction when Lys3 of PD1 is exchanged with alanine (PD1-K(-4)A) (Table 1) confirms that Lys3 is able to replace the above described function of common P-3 anchor residues regardless of whether it builds a salt-bridge to the side-chain of D94 or not. The PD1 Tyr4 side-chain lies atop a hydrophobic pocket and is involved in extensive van der Waals interactions with the imidazole ring of H92, which is placed onto the compass pocket of HckSH3 and therefore becomes an integral part of the ligand binding interface. Ligands with hydrophobic residues at position P-3 are known for the Abl SH3 domain.64 To check whether PD1 could act as an Abl SH3 ligand, we determined the affinity of PD1 to Abl SH3 by fluorescence titration experiments and could not detect any significant interaction (data not shown). Consistent with this, the hydrophobic anchor residues of Abl ligands 3BP-1 (PDB code 1ABO59), 3BP-2 (PDB code 1FYN59) and p41 (PDB code 1BBZ51) superpose with Lys3, and not with Tyr4, of PD1 (Figure 6(b)). Tyr4 contributes to the binding affinity of PD1 to HckSH3 by creating additional interactions with the hydrophobic patch of the RT loop. This is supported by a more than 70-fold increased KD value of PD1-Y (-3)A to HckSH3 as compared to PD1. PD1-Y(-3)R yielded only a twofold increase of the KD as compared to PD1, demonstrating that arginine at position P-3 is at least partially able to substitute the contribution of Tyr4 to the binding affinity. Summarized, the structure of the HckSH3 bound to the PD1 peptide in combination with the described fluorescence titration data reveal that outside the core xPxxP motif the ligand residues do not necessarily need to conform to the Src-type SH3 ligand consensus. Up to now, several exceptions have challenged the generality of the SH3 consensus motif and in most cases they can be explained by distinctive features in the amino acid sequence of the respective SH3 domain.65­70 In case of the standard SH3 domains from Src-family kinases Lck and Fyn, a low affinity ligand with a RkxxYxxY binding motif was identified.69 Here we present a ligand with unusual amino acid sequence that is able to bind HckSH3 with higher affinity than peptide ligands satisfying the standard SH3 consensus sequence. Due to the extended S-shaped conformation of the N-terminal PD1 peptide back-

complex with a proline-rich peptide ligand derived from the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase, although it shows the usual +xxPxxP consensus sequence.50 However, structure calculations containing additional constraints to enforce a salt-bridge between side-chains of Lys3 and D95 in the PD1:HckSH3 complex did not induce additional distance violations or van der Waals clashes. A comparison of the PD1 peptide backbone with the two peptides VSL1263 and RLP248 in complex with the c-Src SH3 reveals that the peptide residue Lys3 is positioned to a location relative to the D95 side-chain that is similar to the arginine residues in "standard" ligands (Figure 6(a)). Superposition of the VSL12 and RLP2 peptides with the HckSH3:PD1 complex reveals the C atoms of the anchor arginine residues in VSL12, RLP2 and that of the Lys3 residue in PD1 to have similar distances to the C atom of D95 in the respective HckSH3 domain, namely about 11 Å.

1526 bone, the lysine at P-4 is positioned to act as anchor residue. The tyrosine at position P-3 is able to contribute by additional interactions with the hydrophobic patch in the RT loop to form an extended binding interface. The fact that PD1 binds with higher affinity to HckSH3 than any other peptide ligand, might open the way to identify artificial ligands with increased specificity to selected SH3 domains for use in basic research of signal transduction networks and disease treatment. Consequences for computational prediction tools In addition to the impact artificial ligands could have for future research, it might well be that there are physiological SH3 ligands present in cells that do not conform to the ligand consensus sequences known so far. Such ligands cannot be detected by computational screening and prediction tools based on the presently available databases for SH3 ligand interactions. To demonstrate this, we compared the KD values of PD1, PD1-Y(-3)R, PD1-Y(-3)A, PD1-K(-4)A as well as those of two putative physiological HckSH3 binding peptides to HckSH3. Values obtained from fluorescence titration experiments were compared with the predicted HckSH3 interaction scores listed in Table 1 using the iSPOT database.71­73 Because the iSPOT algorithm is based on information extracted from position-specific contacts derived from SH3-ligand complexes with known structures, the underlying SH3-specific matrix evaluates the probability of peptide binding to a specific SH3 domain with a bias for similarities to known SH3-peptide complexes. Not surprisingly, relative iSPOT scores for the examined Sam68 and Sos derived peptides, comprising established class II binding motifs, are in good accordance to the relative difference of the measured KD values. The low score predicted for PD1 peptide binding to HckSH3 does not agree with the KD measured for this complex. The PD1-Y(-3)R peptide, which shows the usual Src type SH3 domain binding consensus, receives a conspicuously higher score than the PD1 peptide. The PD1-K (-4)A and PD1-Y(-3)A peptides also have low iSPOT scores for their interaction with HckSH3, which do not correspond to the experimental affinities. Therefore, by implementing the interaction data of the presented HckSH3:PD1 complex structure in existing algorithms, a more accurate prediction of certain uncommon HckSH3­ligand interactions should be possible. Biological relevance A blast search74 with PD1 as query revealed similarities of PD1 to the cytoplasmatic part of several ADAM metallopeptidase domain 22 isoforms. The long cytoplasmic tail of ADAM22 differs in length within the known five ADAM22 splice variants/isoforms.75,76 Whereas splice variants , ,

Structure of Hck SH3 Domain Ligand Complex

 contain the PD1 homologous sequence within their very C-terminal regions, the somewhat shorter variants  and  do not. Interestingly, the PD1 corresponding sequence (YPMPPLP; amino acid positions 882-888 in isoform 1/; accession no. NP_068369) covers Tyr4 of PD1 as well as the core PxxP motif. To confirm this finding, we examined the affinity of a peptide (15-mer) based on the putative HckSH3-binding sequence of ADAM22, which is conserved in isoforms , , , to recombinant HckSH3. We found a KD value of 37 M. A peptide including an alanine instead of tyrosine corresponding to the PD1 Tyr4 relevant position revealed a KD value of about 300 M (Table 1). This indicates a great importance for this tyrosine residue of the ADAM22-derived peptide for HckSH3 binding as it was already demonstrated for PD1 (Table 1). Thus, even if the affinity of the ADAM22-derived peptide to HckSH3 is not in the nanomolar range like PD1, its affinity is comparable to that of other peptides derived from known cellular HckSH3 interaction partners like Sam68, Sos (Table 1), and RasGAP.29 From our knowledge no cellular interaction partner for SH3 domains had been described up to now that shows affinities in the submicromolar scale. This is in accordance with the function of these domains, which are docking modules with very dynamic properties. Otherwise, the results of our study show that SH3 domains surely have the potential to bind to some artificial or pathogenderived peptides even in the submicromolar range. In most cases, these peptides are from artificial sources, often derived from phage display selection studies (e.g. the high affinity SrcSH3 peptides VSL12 and RLP263). We hypothesise that viruses deal with this scope by evolving high affinity SH3 binding proteins like the HIV Nef protein,24 which, because of their unusual high binding strength, are able to manipulate the cellular function of the affected SH3 domain. What might be the function of the above-mentioned interaction of ADAM22 and Hck? ADAM22, like ADAM11 and ADAM23, is a brain-derived ADAM protein. The extra cellular disintegrin-like domain of these ADAM proteins is homologous to that of ADAM2 and ADAM15, which are known to be potential integrin ligands. It is suggested that ADAM22 interacts via its cytoplasmic tail with cytoplasmic proteins in signal transduction events, which are related to cell growth and development. Interaction data, which were derived from yeast two-hybrid screens with amino acid residues 761­ 859 (not including the PD1 homologous region) of ADAM22 as bait recently suggested it to potentially bind to 14-3-3, a member of a highly conserved protein family ubiquitously presented in eukaryotic cells whose members function as adaptors, linkers or co-ordinators in assembling signaling complexes and are ubiquitously present in eukaryotic cells.77,78 As mentioned above, the splice variants ,  and  of ADAM22 have extended cytoplasmic tails. Only these variants include the somewhat unusual SH3-binding motif, which shows similarities to the

PD1 sequence. In this context, it is interesting that, like in other ADAM proteins (ADAM1, 7­10, 12 and 17), the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM15 contains motifs for interaction with SH3 domains. Thereby, specific interactions between the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM15 and two Src family PTK members, Hck and Lck as well as for the SH3 domain of Grb2, could be demonstrated. 79 An alignment of e.g. the respective ADAM22 regions of splice variants , , and  with the cytoplasmic part of ADAM15 would show several conformities, mainly in the PxxP core motif region for SH3 binding. To discuss a possible role for the HckSH3­ ADAM22 interaction, the cellular distribution of both proteins has to be considered. According to the present literature, ADAM22 is mainly expressed in the brain, whereas Hck is believed to be myeloid cellspecific. A look in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database shows that under certain circumstances, e.g. after viral infection, ADAM22 could also be found in macrophages (accession GDS1271; 161039_at). Microglia cells might be another possible location for a potential HckSH3­ADAM22 interaction. According to its homology to ADAM15, ADAM22 is discussed as a potential integrin ligand. Very recent studies show that ADAM22 inhibits cellular proliferation via its disintegrin domain. This appears to be mediated by interaction of this domain with specific integrins.80 Src-type kinases like Hck and the closely related Lyn, play an important role in integrin signaling within leukocytes.81 For Hck a selective recruitment by certain integrins is documented in the literature. 82 Thereby, a direct interaction of Hck and the cytoplasmic tail of integrin  results in an activated kinase.83 One might speculate now that Hck or alternatively Lyn, which also shows substantial binding to the PD1 sequence (data not shown) and was demonstrated to be the predominant Src kinase activity in glioblastoma tumor cells, 84 might play a role in the regulation of integrin/ disintegrin-mediated cell adhesion and related signaling events via a direct interaction with ADAM22. This certainly needs extensive investigation by further experiments. It is a controversally discussed matter, whether Src-family kinases or their SH3 domains are useful therapeutic targets.85 In the case of SH3 targeting drugs, the issue of specificity is regarded to be the major problem. Recently, a broadly applicable method that combines the benefits from phage display with that of small-molecule compound libraries was presented for novel integrin blockers.86 In our view, it would be a promising and simple approach, to look for small synthetic molecules that are able to displace PD1 from HckSH3 somehow similar to an approach reported recently.87 Such molecules, because they should mirror the high affinity and the unusual features of PD1, might be potent lead molecules for the development of new therapeutics that are able to influence Hck activity.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification HckSH3 protein: A DNA fragment coding for the SH3 domain of Hck (residues 60 to 140, HckSH3; residue numbering scheme of the human p60hck) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pGEX-6P-2 (GE Healthcare) using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites introduced by PCR. Sequence analysis of the resulting expression plasmid pGEX-HckSH3 confirmed 100% identity with human HckSH3 (SwissProt accession no. P08631). The construct contains a PreScission protease cleavage site to remove the N-terminal glutathione-Stransferase (GST) affinity tag from the HckSH3 peptide. The GST-HckSH3 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 transformed with pGEXHckSH3. Cells with an A600 nm of about 0.6 were induced with 1 mM isopropyl--D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and harvested after 4 h growth at 37 °C. For 15 N and/or 13C labelling, M9 minimal medium88 was used with [15N]ammonium chloride and [13C]glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. GSTHckSH3 fusion protein was purified using affinity chromatography on glutathione Sepharose. Cleavage with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) was performed as per manufacturer's protocol and applied to a Superdex 75 prepgrade gel filtration column equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) containing 20 mM sodium chloride. The protein mass was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, the final yield of purified HckSH3 was 12 mg/l cell culture. Peptides Peptides PD1, PD1-Y(-3)R, Sam6834­48 and Sos1147­1161 or PD1-Y(-3)A and PD1-K(-4)A were purchased as reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography purified products from JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH (Berlin, Germany) or Coring System Diagnostix GmbH (Gernsheim, Germany) with their N and C-terminal ends being acetylated and amidated, respectively. Identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF MS). Fluorescence spectroscopy and calculation of the binding constants Fluorescence titration experiment of peptides to the SH3 domain were performed by using a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and an emission wavelength of 345 nm (slid width 3.4 nm) as described.40 Measurements of binding affinities are based on the interaction of the peptides with aromatic residues (predominantly tryptophan) in the SH3 domains. To obtain the titration curves for calculating the binding constants, peptides from stock solutions in H2O were added in small increments to 1.6 ml of PBS, 1 mM DTT containing 0.5 M of the free SH3 domain. The experimental data were fitted according to equation (1), where Ltot is the total peptide (ligand) and Ptot is the total SH3 (protein) concentration at each measurement point, F is the measured fluorescence intensity at the particular peptide concentration, and Fmax is the observed maximal

Surface plasmon resonance analysis Surface plasmon resonance experiments of ADAM22peptides to HckSH3 were carried out using a BIAcore X (Biacore AB, Sweden). HckSH3 was immobilized on a CM5 carboxymethyldextran biosensor chip (Biacore) via amine coupling. The immobilization of HckSH3 (in 10 mM NaAc, pH 4.5) was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 l/min in HBS-EP running buffer 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% P20 surfactant. A second channel on the same chip was treated only with the NaAc buffer as a negative control. The binding event of the ADAM22-peptides at various concentrations ranging from 5 to 800 M to HckSH3 was measured at 25 °C with a flow rate of 5 l/min for 180 s. The dissociation constant was calculated using the Biacore Analysis Software (Biaevaluation) by fitting the mean maximum response values from the binding curves to a simple 1:1 ligand:receptor binding model. NMR sample preparation The NMR sample contains approximately 1 mM of the HckSH3 protein for the free HckSH3 domain and 1.3 mM for the 1:1 complex of the HckSH3 domain and PD1 in a 93% H2O/7% 2 H2O buffer containing 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.7) and 20 mM sodium chloride. For the H2O/2H2O amide proton exchange experiments the sample was lyophilised and dissolved in 99.9% 2 H2O. Data acquisition and processing NMR spectra were acquired at 14.1 and 18.8 T on Varian Unity INOVA spectrometers using 5 mm XYZPFG-1H{13C,15N}- and Z-PFG-1H{13C,15N} probes at 25 °C, respectively. Data were processed with NMRPipe89 and VNMRJ (Varian, Inc.) and analysed with CARA.90 NMR titration experiment Titration of the unlabelled PD1 peptide to the 15Nlabelled HckSH3 were used to determine the protein residues involved in ligand binding by measuring the changes in HN and N chemical shifts via 2D 1H-15N-HSQC spectra. Changes in HN and N chemical shifts were monitored until no further changes occur in the chemical shifts upon peptide addition. Using a starting concentration of 300 M for HckSH3 and a stock solution of PD1, the

titrations were performed to an 1:1 ratio of HckSH3 and PD1. Sequential/side-chain assignment The sequential assignments of the free HckSH3 domain were accomplished by a combination of 1 H- 15 NHSQC91,92 and HNCACB,93 that of the HckSH3:PD1 complex by 1H-15N-HSQC, 1H-13C-HSQC,94 HNCACB, HNCO,95 HNHA,96 C(CO)NH,97 H(CCO)NH,97 HCCHCOSY98 and HCCH-TOCSY.98 Aromatic resonance assignments were made using the (HB)CB(CGCD)HD, (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE99 and the 1 H/15N and 1H/13C 3D NOESY spectra. Side-chain carbonyl carbon resonance assignments of free and PD1bound HckSH3 aspartic and glutamic acid residues were accomplished by using the H(C)CO2 spectra.57 The sequential assignments of the PD1 protons were made using a series of two-dimensional COSY, TOCSY and NOESY filter experiments (120 ms NOESY mixing time), in which the signals from the 15N and 13C-attached protons of the HckSH3 domain are purged.100 Structure calculation Interproton distance restraints were determined from a 120 ms mixing time 1H/15N 3D NOESY-HSQC101 and two 1 H/13C 3D HSQC-NOESY spectra for aliphatic and aromatic protons with 100 and 150 ms mixing time, respectively.102 Intermolecular NOEs were detected from a 150 ms mixing time 13 C/ 15 N-filtered, 13 C/ 15 N-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC.103 The peak picking and assignment of the NOE ­crosspeaks as well as the calculation of the structures were accomplished by RADAR, an automated NOESY spectral analysis software, which combines ATNOS104 for automated NOESY peak picking and NOE signal identification in NOESY spectra and CANDID105 for combined automated NOE assignment and structure determination, and the torsion angle dynamic simulation program DYANA.106 PROCHECK-NMR107 and MOLMOL108 were used to assess the quality of the structures and extract structural parameters. MOLMOL and POV-Ray were used to prepare Figures 2, 4, 5(e) and 6. Data bank accession codes The coordinates of the 20 lowest-energy structures out of 100 initially generated structures have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with the accession code 2A4Y. Chemical shift assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank with BMRB entry number 6581.
