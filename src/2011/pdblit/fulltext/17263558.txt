ABSTRACT: The plasma lipoprotein lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] comprises a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle covalently attached to the glycoprotein apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. Apo(a) consists of multiple tandem repeating kringle modules, similar to plasminogen kringle IV (designated KIV1-KIV10), followed by modules homologous to the kringle V module and protease domain of plasminogen. The apo(a) KIV modules have been classified on the basis of their binding affinity for lysine and lysine analogues. The strong lysine-binding apo(a) KIV10 module mediates lysine-dependent interactions with fibrin and cellsurface receptors. Weak lysine-binding apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8 modules display a 2-3-fold difference in lysine affinity and play a direct role in the noncovalent step in Lp(a) assembly through binding to unique lysine-containing sequences in apolipoproteinB-100 (apoB-100). The present study describes the nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of apo(a) KIV8 and its solution dynamics properties, the first for an apo(a) kringle module, and compares the effects of -aminocaproic acid ( -ACA) binding on the backbone and side-chain conformation of KIV7 and KIV8 on a per residue basis. Apo(a) KIV8 adopts a well-ordered structure that shares the general tri-loop kringle topology with apo(a) KIV6, KIV7, and KIV10. Mapping of -ACA-induced chemical-shift changes on KIV7 and KIV8 indicate that the same residues are affected, despite a 2-3-fold difference in -ACA affinity. A unique loop conformation within KIV8, involving hydrophobic interactions with Tyr40, affects the positioning of Arg35 relative to the lysine-binding site (LBS). A difference in the orientation of the aromatic side chains comprising the hydrophobic center of the LBS in KIV8 decreases the size of the hydrophobic cleft compared to other apo(a) KIV modules. An exposed hydrophobic patch contiguous with the LBS in KIV8 and not conserved in other weak lysinebinding apo(a) kringle modules may modulate specificity for regions within apoB-100. An additional ligand recognition site comprises a structured arginine-glycine-aspartate motif at the N terminus of the KIV8 module, which may mediate Lp(a)/apo(a)-integrin interactions.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]1 is a plasma lipoprotein comprising a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-like moiety that is attached to the glycoprotein apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] by a single disulfide bond (1, 2). The LDL moiety of Lp(a) is similar to the plasma-derived LDL both in lipid composition and in

the presence of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) (3). As such, the apo(a) component likely confers the unique structural and functional properties that have been attributed to Lp(a). Apo(a) contains tandem repeats of a sequence that closely resembles plasminogen kringle IV (75-85% similarity), followed by sequences that are highly homologous to the kringle V and protease domains of plasminogen (4). On the basis of the amino acid sequence, apo(a) contains 10 distinct subclasses of plasminogen kringle IV-like domains (KIV1-KIV10) (4). Apo(a) KIV types 1 and 3-10 are present as single copies, while the kringle IV type 2 domain (KIV2) is present in a variable number of identically repeated copies and is the molecular basis for the observed isoform size heterogeneity of Lp(a) (5, 6).

NMR Solution Structure of the Apo(a) KIV8 Module While a physiological role of Lp(a) has yet to be determined, numerous epidemiological studies have identified elevated plasma Lp(a) concentrations as a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic disorders, including coronary heart disease (reviewed in refs 7 and 8). The unique structure of Lp(a) has suggested both a proatherogenic role, because of its similarity to LDL, and a prothrombotic/antifibrinolytic role, on the basis of the resemblance of apo(a) to plasminogen (9-11). It is generally accepted that the assembly of LDL and apo(a) into the Lp(a) particle is a two-step process in which a noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB100 (12-16) precedes disulfide bond formation between a free cysteine residue (Cys4507) within the KIV9 module of apo(a) (1, 2) and a cysteine residue of apoB-100, the identify of which remains to be definitively identified. Biochemical and biophysical studies have implicated Cys3734 of apoB100 in the covalent step (17, 18), while more recent sitedirected mutagenesis studies suggested that Cys4326 in apoB100 was required for Lp(a) formation (19, 20). In Vitro studies have shown that the noncovalent step in Lp(a) assembly can be inhibited by the addition of lysine, lysine analogues, arginine, proline, and phenylalanine (15, 21-23) and that the weak lysine-binding sites (LBS) present within the KIV5-KIV8 region of apo(a) are likely involved in mediating this interaction (16, 21, 22, 24, 25). Apo(a) KIV6 (15, 22, 26), KIV7 (12, 15, 16, 26), and KIV8 (12, 15) modules have been implicated in the noncovalent step, and recombinant constructs of each have been shown to display moderate to weak affinities for the lysine analogue -aminocaproic acid ( -ACA) (12, 27), when compared to the highaffinity -ACA-binding KIV10 module [dissociation constant (Kd) ) 20 µM] (24, 28-31). KIV6 and KIV7, whose structures have been previously determined (27, 32), display similar -ACA affinities (Kd  0.2-0.3 mM), while KIV8 has a 2-3-fold lower affinity (12). Mutagenesis studies ruled out a role for KIV6 in the initial noncovalent step, while KIV7 and KIV8 were both required for maximally efficient noncovalent and covalent Lp(a) assembly and recognized unique lysine-containing sequences in apoB-100 of the LDLlike moiety (12, 14). A recent role for apo(a) in integrin-mediated cellular functions has also emerged. A lysine-dependent interaction between apo(a) and the Mac-1 integrin promoted endothelial cell adhesion and migration (33). Lp(a) also decreased platelet aggregation through an interaction between the fibrinogen receptor and the sole arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif of apo(a), which is located at the N terminus of the KIV8 module (34). In this study, we describe the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of the KIV8 module of apo(a), which has a similar overall fold to structures of apo(a) KIV6 (27), KIV7 (32), and KIV10 (29, 30). Analysis of the dynamics properties of KIV8 is presented, the first for an apo(a) kringle module, and using backbone chemical-shift mapping, we show that there is no significant difference in the residues of KIV7 and KIV8 affected by -ACA binding, despite a 2-3-fold difference in the binding affinity. Notable differences in KIV8 are observed in the side-chain orientations of several aromatic residues, both within and adjacent to the LBS, and appear to alter the cationic and hydrophobic centers of the LBS. These observations provide a structural rationale for the differential modes of apoB-100 recognition

In addition, the structure reveals that the RGD motif within KIV8 is structured and indeed accessible for the interaction with integrin target proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning of Apo(a) KIV8/pET-16b and KIV7/pET-16b. The upstream and downstream primers GGACTGACATATGGCACAACTGAAAACAGCAC and CCCATATGTTAGACACTCGATTCTGTCACTGGACATCGTGTCAGGTTGC, respectively, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with the KIV8/prK5 plasmid2 to generate a 300 base pair (bp) fragment encoding apo(a) KIV8 with 5 and 3 NdeI restriction sites (underlined). The resulting fragment was subcloned and ligated into the EcoRV site of BlueScript (Strategene) using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5R. The ligation mixture was plated on Luria Bertani (LB)-ampicillin plates containing isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and X-galactose. Plasmids were extracted from white colonies and digested with NdeI to excise the 300 bp fragment. The digested fragment was inserted into the NdeI site of the cloning region of a pET-16b expression vector (Stratagene) using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The directionality and sequence of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the plasmid was transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain for expression. The apo(a) KIV7/pET-16b expression plasmid was constructed in a manner similar to the apo(a) KIV8/pET-16b expression plasmid, with the exception that the KIV7/prk5 plasmid and the NdeI-containing (underlined) up- and downstream primers GGACTGACATATGGCACCAACGGAGCAAAGCCC and GGCATATGTTAGAGAGTTGATTCCATCACTGGAC were used to generate the 300 bp fragment encoding apo(a) KIV7. Protein Expression and Purification. The expression, refolding, and purification of recombinant apo(a) KIV8 and KIV7 were performed using a modified protocol by Becker et al. (12). Transformed cells were grown in LB media supplemented with 100 µg/L ampicillin in a 2.8 L Fernbach flask at 37 °C with shaking to an OD600 of 0.75. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and growth was continued for an additional 6 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a volume of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole) equal to 10 times their packed weight, and disrupted by sonication (4 × 30 s) on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 48000g in a Beckman 25.5 rotor. The supernatant solution was discarded; the pellet was resuspended in buffer A to 5 times its packed weight; and the sonication and centrifugation steps were repeated. The pellet was resuspended, sonicated (4 × 30 s) in buffer B [20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 0.5% Triton, and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)] and left to rock at 4 °C for 3 days. The suspension was increased to 5 times its original volume in buffer A; the concentrations of oxidized and reduced glutathione were added to a final concentration of 1.25 mM; and the sample was agitated overnight at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a column packed with 2 mL of Ni2+-chelating sepharose

The bound protein was eluted with buffer A containing 1 M imidazole in 1 mL fractions. Fractions containing protein were determined by the Bradford assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), pooled, and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 size-exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9 and 25 mM NaCl. Elution fractions (3 mL) were collected using the same buffer. Fractions containing protein were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon stirred cell (Millipore Corporation) with a 1 kDa membrane at 4 °C under pressure from nitrogen gas. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 3.5 using trifluoracetic acid, filtered using a 0.45 µm nylon acrodisc filter, and loaded on a Vydar C18 protein and peptide column attached to a Beckman high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Apo(a) KIV8 and KIV7 eluted in 34 and 30% acetonitrile treated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, respectively. Acetonitrile was removed from the samples using a Savant Speed Vac Concentrator, and the samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. Dried protein was stored at -20 °C. Uniformly 15N- and 13C/15N-labeled apo(a) KIV8 and KIV7 were expressed, refolded, and purified in a manner similar to that of the unlabeled protein, with the exception that a 5 mL bacterial culture of LB was used to inoculate 50 mL of M9 minimal media containing 14N-NH4Cl and 12C-glucose. At an OD600 of 1.1, 10 mL was used to inoculate 1 L of M9 minimal media containing 1 g/L 15N-NH4Cl for uniform 15N labeling and 2 g/L 13C-glucose and 1 g/L 15N-NH4Cl for uniform 13C/15N labeling (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). At induction, 15N- and 13C/15N-labeled growths were supplemented with 10 mL of 15N-Bio-Express-1000 media or 10 mL of 13C/15N-Bio-Express-1000 media (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), respectively, and 50 µg/L ampicillin. Growth was continued for 14 h after IPTG induction at 30 °C. NMR samples were prepared in 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.2 in 90% H2O/10% D2O (v/v) to a final protein concentration of 1 mM. NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on Varian 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with pulse field-gradient triple-resonance cryoprobes. Sequential backbone and side-chain assignments were determined using 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) (35), HNCACB (36), CBCACONH (37), HNHA (38, 39), C(CO)NH-total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and HC(CO)NH-TOCSY (40), and HCCH-TOCSY (41) experiments. 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of apo(a) KIV8 have been deposited in the BMRB (accession number 7032). Interproton distances of apo(a) KIV8 were measured from three-dimensional 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectrometry (NOESY)-HSQC (42), 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (43), and 13C-aromatic NOESY (44) datasets with mixing times of 150 ms. All data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (45) and NMRView (46), respectively. 15 N T1, 15N T2, and {1H}-15N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) values for the apo(a) KIV8 were measured at 600 MHz using experiments similar to those described by Farrow et al. (47). Longitudinal delays of 10, 20, 40, 80, 320, and 640 ms (T1) and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)

Chitayat et al. delays of 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 150, and 190 ms (T2) were used in the acquisition of the data. Steady-state heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE data were obtained with and without 3 s of proton saturation and a total recycle delay of 7 s. NOE values were extracted as the ratio of peak intensities with and without proton saturation for 73 well-resolved resonances. Rate analysis functions in NMRView 5.0.4 were used to analyze the T1 and T2 decay rates, which were computed using the two-parameter model using CurveFit (48) for 70 well-resolved resonances. The isotropic rotation correlation time (m) was approximated using the ratio of R2/R1, and average R2 and R1 values were computed for only wellresolved resonances. Structure Calculation. Structures of apo(a) KIV8 were generated using the simulated annealing protocol in CNS 1.1 with 20 000 molecular dynamic steps and 10 cycles of 1000 minimization steps (49). Interproton distances were calibrated for all proton pairs using maximum and minimum NOE intensities for known distances (d N, dRN, and dNN) in regions comprising the loop or extended structure. A total of 3044 NOE-derived distance restraints were obtained for the structure calculation, including 2098 short-range (intraresidue and sequential), 348 medium-range (1 < |i - j| e 5), and 598 long-range (|i - j| > 5) distance restraints. Additional restraints were introduced corresponding to the well-conserved kringle module disulfide bond pattern (Cys1Cys78, Cys22-Cys61, and Cys50-Cys73). Backbone dihedral angle restraints ( angle) for six residues, Cys1, Tyr2, Cys61, Trp70, Thr76, and Arg77, located in secondary-structure elements, were obtained from analysis of 13CR, 13C , 13C, 1 R H , and 15N chemical shifts using TALOS (50). An additional 43  angle restraints were used from HNHAderived 3JHNR coupling constants (51). The 20 lowest energy structures with no distance violations greater than 0.3 Å and no angle violations greater than 5° were accepted into the final ensemble, and the quality of the structures was evaluated using PROCHECK and MOLMOL (52, 53). All figures representing structures were generated using MOLMOL (53) or PyMOL (54). NMR-Based -ACA Titrations. Titrations of 0.21 mM 15Napo(a) KIV8 or 0.21 mM 15N-apo(a) KIV7 with incremental additions of -ACA were monitored using 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded at 25 °C and 600 MHz. Sequential additions of -ACA giving rise to a total concentration of 200 µM, 800 µM, 1.5 mM, 3 mM, 6 mM, 10 mM, and 20 mM were added to apo(a) KIV8 and 36 µM, 100 µM, 180 µM, 240 µM, 360 µM, 540 µM, 720 µM, 1.5 mM, 2.5 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM were added to apo(a) KIV7. Sample buffer conditions were 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.2. The data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe and NMRView 5.2.2, respectively (45, 46), and dissociation constant (Kd) values were interpolated from plots of the chemical-shift change as a function of the -ACA concentration. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Effects on the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence properties of apo(a) KIV7 and apo(a) KIV8 by a variety of amino acids were monitored using a Fluorolog-3 spectrometer (Horiba JobinYvon). Incremental additions of glycine, -ACA, and Lamino acids, glutamine, proline, lysine, or arginine, from 1 M stock solutions were made to either 200 nM apo(a) KIV7 or 200 nM apo(a) KIV8, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 340 nm, respectively. The amino

acid and protein solution contained 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9 and 25 mM NaCl. The data were plotted and analyzed using SigmaPlot to obtain Kd values. RESULTS Resonance Assignments and the Solution Structure of Apo(a) KIV8. The assignment of backbone and side-chain 1H, 15 N, and 13C resonances of apo(a) KIV8 was completed using standard multidimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques. In total, 94% of the expected backbone (Figure 1) and 91% of the side-chain resonances were assigned for the 102residue construct comprising residues 3867-3962 of apo(a) (4) and a N-terminal deca-histidine tag. Backbone amide proton resonances of two N-terminal interkingle residues (Gly[-15] and His[-13]) and four core residues (Ser8, Arg10, Arg35, and Cys73) were not observed in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, indicating that these residues occupy regions of the protein module that are exposed to the solvent. NMR structures were calculated using 3044 NOE-derived distance restraints and 43 backbone  and 6  dihedral angle

restraints obtained as described in the Materials and Methods. Using an extended starting model of apo(a) KIV8, 133 structures were accepted from the 200 total generated structures based on the fact that they had no distance restraint violations greater than 0.3 Å and no dihedral angle restraint ( and ) violations greater than 5°. From these accepted structures, the 20 lowest energy structures were selected for further analysis, and a summary of structural statistics is shown in Table 1. An average structure from this ensemble was calculated and minimized against experimental restraints. KIV8 adopts the typical tri-loop kringle fold, comprising two short sheets and several loops and turns (Figure 2). A backbone superposition of the 20 lowest energy NMR structures, shown in Figure 2A, indicates that KIV8 is welldefined by the NMR data, with the exception of a loop region comprising residues Gly4-Gly11and the N- and C-interkringle regions, defined by Ile[-17]-Asp[-1] and Pro[79]-Val[102], respectively. The lack of medium- and long-range NOEs associated with these regions suggest that they are disordered in solution. The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) from the

minimized average structure for the well-defined core of the ensemble, defined by residues Cys1-Cys78, is 0.764 ( 0.07 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.31 ( 0.11 Å for all heavy atoms. Ramachandran analysis in PROCHECK-NMR (52) indicated that 95% of all residues comprising the core region of KIV8 fell within the allowed regions of  and  space. The overall fold of apo(a) KIV8 is similar to previously solved apo(a) kringle module structures, including the weak lysine-binding KIV6 (27) and KIV7 (32) modules and the high-affinity lysine-binding apo(a) KIV10 module (29). An antiparallel sheet (Trp60-Tyr62 and Trp70-Tyr72) and a parallel sheet (Cys1-Tyr2 and Thr76-Arg77) form the secondary-structure elements of KIV8, while the remainder of the protein module comprises several loops and turns. KIV8 lacks the 310 helix observed in the apo(a) KIV6 solution structure (27), which is also absent in the crystal structure of apo(a) KIV7 (32). Solution Dynamics of Apo(a) KIV8. To investigate the backbone dynamic properties of KIV8, the steady-state {1H}-15N NOE and longitudinal 15N T1 and transverse 15N T2 relaxation time constants were measured (Figure 3). Quantification of peak intensities was possible for 73 of the 88 total HN backbone resonances from the {1H}-15N NOE dataset and 70 of the 88 total HN backbone resonances in the 15N T1 and 15N T2 datasets. A partial overlap or weak signal precluded reliable quantification of the remaining HN backbone resonances. The average {1H}-15N NOE value for residues Cys1-Cys78 inclusive is 0.762, a value similar to that previously observed for the kringle 1 (KI) module of human plasminogen in the absence and presence of -ACA (55), and implies that the core of the apo(a) KIV8 module is well-ordered. These NOE values are consistent with our experimental 15N T1 and 15N T2 values, which have averages for the core region of 569 and 78.1 ms, respectively. Very

The backbone of the residues found within two short sheets are colored green and indicated by arrows in the minimized average structure. The side chains of the RGD motif are colored red and labeled using a one-letter code for amino acid type, followed by the position in sequence.

little deviation from these values is observed within the core region, suggesting that the relaxation properties of the molecule are governed by the overall diffusion tensor. Residues comprising the N-terminal interkringle region (Ile[-17]-Asp[-1]), Thr97, Val102 at the extreme C termini, and Gly11 within the core region of apo(a) KIV8 display smaller than average T1/T2 ratios, indicating increased mobility within these regions (parts B and C of Figure 3). Further, significantly reduced {1H}-15N NOE values are observed for these regions (Ile[-17]-Asp[-1], Gly11, and Pro[79]-Val[102]), indicating that they are undergoing motion on the subnanosecond time scale (Figure 3A). These observations are consistent with the lack of observed medium- and long-range NOEs within these regions and, in the case of Gly11, backbone amide protons of proximal residues (Ser8 and Arg10) undergoing exchange with the solvent. An isotropic correlation time (m) of 7.23 ns was estimated for the core region apo(a) KIV8 from 15N T1 and 15N T2 values (56). This value is similar to the estimated m of 7.97 ns for the amino-terminal kringle module of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (57) and somewhat larger than those for the plaminogen kringle 1 (apo form, 5.91 ns; -ACAbound form, 5.23 ns) (55) and 2 [trans-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (AMCHA)-bound form, 4.49 ns] (58). No aggregation was observed during size-exclusion chromatographic analysis of the purified apo(a) KIV8, and

the 1H line widths were not indicative of higher oligomeric species. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a monomer-dimer equilibrium exists. Overall, the NMR relaxation results do suggest that the apo(a) KIV8 construct is stable and ordered, with the exception of the N- and C-terminal interkringle regions and a region comprising Gly11, data which is consistent with the NOE-based NMR

Although both apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8 modules have been identified as weak lysine-binding kringle modules (12, 15, 16), KIV8 displays a 2-3-fold lower affinity for lysine analogue -ACA, despite the 84% sequence identity

FIGURE 4: Plot of -ACA-induced average amide chemical-shift changes () along the sequence and on the backbone ribbon diagram of (A) apo(a) KIV7 and (B) apo(a) KIV8. The average chemical-shift changes were calculated using the formula  ) [(0.17N)2 + (HN)2]1/2 (61). Red bars in the histograms and red-colored regions on the backbone ribbon diagrams indicate residues that exhibit chemical-shift changes exceeding the average chemical-shift change by greater than 1 standard deviation [>0.0993 ppm for apo(a) KIV7 and >0.1154 ppm for apo(a) KIV8]. Blue bars and blue-colored regions identify those residues that undergo chemical-shift changes greater than the average chemical-shift change but less than 1 standard deviation above the average [>0.0476 ppm for apo(a) KIV7 and >0.0592 ppm for apo(a) KIV8]. Black dashed lines represent the average chemical-shift change. The N and C termini are labeled in the backbone ribbon diagrams.

shared by these two modules (12). In an attempt to identify differences in -ACA-induced conformational changes between KIV7 and KIV8, we used 2D heteronuclear NMRbased -ACA titration studies. Several backbone amide resonances from KIV7 and KIV8 displayed fast exchange on the NMR time scale upon titration with -ACA (see the Supporting Information), an observation consistent with the previously reported fluorescence-derived dissociation constants (Kd) for the KIV7- -ACA (217 µM) and KIV8- -ACA (800 µM) interactions (12). Quantification of these -ACA-induced backbone HN and 15N chemicalshift changes afforded the identification and comparison of residues whose local environments were affected upon

binding of -ACA. As shown in Figure 4, those residues displaying significant (greater than 1 standard deviation above the average chemical-shift change; red bars) and notable chemical-shift changes (greater than the average chemical-shift change but less than 1 standard deviation above the average; blue bars) were similar for both the apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8 modules. When residues displaying prominent -ACA-induced changes were mapped on the backbone of their respective modules, they include residues of the anionic (KIV7, Asp54; KIV8, Glu56) and hydrophobic (KIV7, Trp60 and Tyr62; KIV8, Tyr62) centers of the LBS and those that are adjacent to the LBS of each module (KIV7, His31-Gln34, Asn42, and Gly44-Arg47; KIV8, Cys50-Arg58,

Cys61, and Glu71). In addition, the side-chain indole groups of Trp60 and Trp70 in the LBS of both KIV7 and KIV8 display notable chemical-shift changes upon incremental additions of -ACA (see the Supporting Information). These observations are similar to those previously seen for KIV6 (27) and KIV10 (30). The only notable difference between affected residues in KIV7 and KIV8 involves Thr21 and Cys22 in each module. The backbone HN groups of these residues in KIV7 displayed chemical-shift changes greater than the average chemical-shift change, while those in KIV8 did not. In both structures, Cys22 forms a disulfide bridge with Cys61, which borders the LBS, and likely results in -ACA-induced conformational effects being transmitted through covalent linkage. While notable, this difference appears to be subtle because the observed chemical-shift changes for Thr21 and Cys22 in KIV7 are slightly greater than the average chemicalshift change, while chemical-shift changes for these residues in KIV8 are slightly below the average chemical-shift change. To assess ligand specificity, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was used to monitor the binding of apo(a) KIV8 to -ACA, lysine, arginine, and proline, which are molecules that have previously been shown to inhibit noncovalent interactions between a recombinant 17-kringle form of apo(a) and immobilized LDL (15). Apo(a) KIV8 preferentially binds -ACA, with a Kd of 655 µM, compared to Kd values of 5.75 and 7.30 mM for L-arginine and L-lysine, respectively (Table 2). When the affinities determined for apo(a) KIV8 were compared to a parallel experiment involving apo(a) KIV7, which gave rise to Kd values of 291 µM, 2.55 mM, and 2.49 mM for -ACA, L-arginine, and L-lysine, respectively, they were found to be 2-3-fold weaker. These observed Kd values for apo(a) KIV7 are similar to those previously determined for apo(a) KIV7 (12, 31), with the exception of the Kd values for arginine and proline. Our value of 2.49 ( 0.4 mM for arginine is significantly less than the value of 6.7 ( 1.1 mM reported by Rahman et al., and we could not detect a fluorescence change upon titration of proline, whereas a Kd value of 4.5 mM for proline was previously determined (31). These differences could be attributed to our modified purification protocol in which we have included an additional HPLC purification step to remove residual ions. DISCUSSION The weak lysine-binding apo(a) kringle modules KIV7 and KIV8 display a 2-3-fold difference in affinity for lysine and lysine analogues, and recently, each has been shown to regulate the noncovalent step in Lp(a) assembly through recognition of unique lysine-containing sequences within apoB-100 (12). These differences occur despite the fact that they share 84% sequence identity, including conservation

of the cationic center (Arg35 and Arg69), anionic center (Asp54 and Glu56), and hydrophobic center (Trp60, Tyr62, Trp70, and Tyr72) of the LBS (4), which was first identified in the plasminogen kringle 4 module (59). In the present work, we have determined the solution structure of KIV8, characterized its dynamic properties, and used NMR spectroscopy to monitor the residue-specific effects of -ACA binding on KIV7 and KIV8 in an attempt to identify the structural basis for the observed differences in ligand affinity and specificity. Comparison to Existing Kringle Module Structures. Threedimensional structures exist for the strong lysine-binding apo(a) KIV10 module (29, 30) and the weak lysine-binding apo(a) KIV6 (27) and KIV7 (32) modules. While the KIV8 structure described here shares a similar overall fold with these structures (Figure 5), backbone pairwise rmsd values of 2.60, 2.71, and 2.56 Å for KIV8 with KIV6, KIV7, and KIV10, respectively, are significantly higher than those previously reported for the comparison of the CR traces of KIV6 with KIV7 (1.64 Å) and KIV10 (1.50 Å) (27) and KIV7 with KIV10 (0.5 Å) (32). Conspicuous differences between the backbone conformations of KIV8 and the other apo(a) kringle modules reside in the N and C termini and within a loop and turn comprising residues 34-45. The relaxation parameters for residues located in the N and C termini of the core region of KIV8 and the temperature factors for the analogous regions

1740 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 7, 2007 in the KIV7 crystal structure indicated that they are wellordered in both modules, ruling out a dynamics-based rationale for the observed structural differences. A hydrogen-bonding network involving Arg35, Tyr40, and Asp54 in the KIV7 crystal structure was previously suggested to play a role in the reduced lysine-binding affinity by restricting the adaptability of the cationic and anionic centers of the LBS to accommodate the ligand (32). An analogous hydrogen-bonding network is not observed in our KIV8 solution structure. Rather, Tyr40 forms extensive hydrophobic contacts with Pro37, Ala43, and Leu45 in KIV8, leading to a 180° difference in orientation of the Tyr40 aromatic ring, when compared to its position in KIV7 (32). Because this conformational deviation restricts Tyr40 from participating in such a hydrogen-bonding network in KIV8, the underlying structural basis for the observed weak lysine affinity must be unique from that of KIV7. Interestingly, the weak LBS of KIV6 has similar hydrophobic and anionic center conformations to those of KIV7, displays similar affinities for lysine analogues to KIV7, yet is also lacking the analogous hydrogen-bonding network (27, 32). Arg35 is a key residue in the cationic center of the LBS and occupies a central position within the LBS of KIV7 because of hydrogen-bonding contacts with Tyr40 and Tyr62 (32). In contrast, the side chain of Arg35 is fully exposed to the solvent and 6.4 Å from the aromatic ring of Tyr62 in KIV8, a residue previously shown to be important for LDL binding by KIV7 (14). The position of Arg35 relative to the LBS in KIV8 suggests that a backbone conformational change would have to accompany lysine binding for the side chain of Arg35 to participate at the cationic center. Crystal structures of KIV10 in the apo and ligand-bound states indicate that the LBS is preformed and that no significant conformational changes accompany ligand binding (29, 30). In the case of KIV6, a lack of a detectable backbone HN resonance for Arg35 led the authors to suggest that this is a region of high flexibility, which could accommodate such a change without distorted proximal regions of the module (27). We were also unable to identify the backbone HN resonance of Arg35 for both KIV7 and KIV8. However, our relaxation parameters show that the region surrounding Arg35 is well-ordered in KIV8, which suggests that the lack of an identifiable backbone HN resonance is due to this group not participating in a hydrogen bond and at the same time being accessible to the solvent. The KIV8 structure and relaxation parameters suggest that a significant change in the backbone conformation would have to occur for Arg35 to optimally participate in the LBS. Given that the KIV7 structure is similar to the apo and complexed KIV10 structures (32) and that our chemical-shift mapping studies of KIV7 and KIV8 indicate that -ACA binding induces a similar and limited backbone conformational change in both modules, these observations suggest that the preformed conformation of the KIV8 LBS is not optimal for ligand binding, thereby resulting in a lower affinity for lysine compared to KIV7. Note, with the exception of Asn, Gln, and Trp side-chain amide groups, the extent of side-chain reorientations within the LBS of KIV8 cannot be determined from the presented chemicalshift mapping data. Inspection of the LBS beyond Arg35 revealed a substantial alteration in the orientation of tryptophan (Trp60 and Trp70) and tyrosine (Tyr62 and Tyr72) residues that comprise the

hydrophobic center, when compared to KIV6, KIV7, and KIV10 (Figure 6). The aromatic rings of Tyr62 and Tyr72 in KIV8 are rotated clockwise 85° and 15°, respectively, when compared to the analogous residues in KIV7 and looking down on the LBS. The indole rings of Trp60 and Trp70 of KIV8 have moved from a vertical stacking position in KIV7, where the plane of the rings aligns with the two strands that form the base of the LBS, to an almost horizontal position, in which the plane of the rings has been rotated almost 90° (Figure 6). The positioning of the indole ring of Trp70 in KIV8 appears to cap the hydrophobic cleft of the LBS, potentially reducing the hydrophobic contacts accessible to -ACA through steric hindrance, thereby contributing to the 2-3-fold decrease in ligand affinity that we and others have observed for KIV8 (12). Additional Ligand-Binding Sites. The observation that kringle modules have substantial sequence identity (>80%) yet display unique ligand affinities and specificities suggests that the binding sites encompass molecular determinants beyond the LBS. Analysis of the apo(a) KIV8 structure reveals an exposed hydrophobic surface formed by residues Met28, Thr29, Trp32, Ile36, Leu38, and Tyr39, which sits adjacent the cationic center (Arg35 and Arg69) of the LBS. Of the residues listed, Met28, Thr29, Trp32, and Tyr39 are conserved among KIV6, KIV7, and KIV8. The threonine and glutamate residues at positions 36 and 38 of both KIV6 and KIV7 are substituted for isoleucine and leucine residues in KIV8. These differences, particularly at position 38, where there is a hydrophobic versus charged residue, may provide a discrete yet critical mechanism by which KIV7 and KIV8 can discriminate between their cognate apoB-100 binding sites

NMR Solution Structure of the Apo(a) KIV8 Module through recognition of residues adjacent to their respective core lysine residue. KIV8 contains the sole RGD motif within uncomplexed apo(a) and in the Lp(a) particle. Recent studies, using an apo(a) RGD epitope, have suggested that this motif is responsible for Lp(a)-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation through binding to the IIb subunit of the fibrinogen receptor (34). The RGD motif is located within a solventexposed loop at the N terminus of KIV8 (Arg3-Gly4-Asp5) and forms a short turn containing a hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Arg3 and the backbone amide proton of Asp5. The structure is similar to the distorted type-II turn formed by the RGD motif from the 10th fibronectin type-III module of fibronectin (60). Future biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies of the RGDmediated interaction between KIV8 and the fibrinogen receptor will provide unique insight into additional roles for KIV8 in apo(a) function.
