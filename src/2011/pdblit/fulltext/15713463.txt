SUMMARY

of td mRNA from TCinfected cells has been determined The splice junction sequence . . . .3 `) and shown to be identical to that of the RNA ligation product encoded by the cloned (5'.... GGU-CUA gene [ Belfort et al. Cell 41 (1985) 375-3821. The RNA processing functions, T4 RNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the host prr gene product appear not to be essential for exon ligation; neither are the host endoribonucleases RNase III, RNase P and RNase E required for intron excision. While these results are consistent with the autocatalytic splicing mechanism demonstrated in vitro [ Chu et al. J. Biol. Chem. 260 (1985) 10680-106881, they leave unanswered the question of which protein(s), if any, might stimulate the in vivo reaction. Analysis of the products of the cloned td gene has led to identification of two td-encoded polypeptides, namely a polypeptide corresponding to the exon-I-coding sequence (NH,-TS), and the catalytically active thymidylate synthase (TS). Kinetic and nucleotide sequence data provide evidence that NH,-TS is the product of the primary transcript and that TS is encoded by spliced mRNA. These results suggest that splicing may provide a switch controlling the relative expression of NH,-TS and TS, two proteins with markedly different temporal appearances despite their identical transcriptional and translational start sites.

Other hosts were E. coli B, E. coli B NapIV (Nelson et al., 1982) and CTRSX (Depew and Cozzarelli, 1974). The phages used were wild-type T4D +, the polynucleotidekinase-defective T4pseT 1 (Depew and Cozzarelli, 1974; from W. Wood) and the RNA-ligase-defective T4rli13 (Runnels et al., 1982; from W. Wood). Hosts used for transformation by pUC9-Td (Chu et al., 1984) were AB2495 and AB2495-prr (polynucleotide kinase R NA ligase restrictive) (Jabbar and Snyder, 1984). The temperature-inducible lysogen N99(Abio lOcI857Pam3) (from D. Wulff) and N99[pcI857] (Remaut et al., 1983) were used as hosts for induction of p,-promoted transcription from the pKC30 (Rosenberg et al., 1983) derivatives. pKTd2, comprising the intact td gene on a 2.85-kb* EcoRI fragment cloned into pKC30, has been described previously (Belfort et al., 1983).

This finding facilitated the use of primer extension sequencing as a means to probe the role of specific phage functions in splicing. While the cloned td gene may be expressed in uninfected E. coli, this does not preclude the involvement of phage products during a normal infection, particularly since phage functions which duplicate host products are a common occurrence in T4. We therefore sought to investigate the involvement in the mRNA ligation reaction of phage-RNA-processing enzymes polynucleotide kinase, the pseT product (Depew and Cozzarelli, 1974; Cameron and

This was achieved by using the clinical host isolate CTRSX, which specifically restricts the growth of T4pseT ~ and T4rZi - phage (Depew and Cozzarelli, 1974).

To identify the protein products encoded by the td gene the intact gene and relevant td subfragments were fused to the %p, promoter in expression plasmid pKC30 (Rosenberg et al.. 1983) (Figs. 4 and 5). These constructs were harbored in thermoinducible ,? lysogens. Labeled proteins encoded by p,-promoted transcripts, induced by the shift from 32°C to 42' C, were separated on PA gels. On this basis, two polypeptides were ascribed to the td gene. One is the 32-kDa mature enzyme (TS); the other is the exon I (ExI) product (NH,-TS), with an apparent M, of 24000 to 25 000. Corresponding bands are seen as products of a 2.85-kb EcoRI fragment which encodes the intact td gene (Fig. 4, lane Td). These bands are absent when the 2.85kb fragment is cloned in reverse orientation (Fig. 4, dT lane). A 12-kDa polypeptide (X), which maps to sequences outside the td gene at the far 3' end of the fragment is also apparent (Fig. 4, lanes Td and ExII, and Fig. 5). The polypeptide assignments were confirmed by using additional constructs, with the data summarized in Fig. 5. The mature synthase is, as anticipated, observed only in the presence of the intact gene, comprising the exon I, intron and exon II subsegments (constructs 1 and 2). The identity of this polypeptide, which corresponds exactly in size to the 32-kDa enzyme subunit, has been confirmed by its specific binding to FdUMP (Belfort et al., 1983) a TS-active-site label. Further, this gene product is synthesized in vitro in a coupled transcription-translation system, binds FdUMP and is immunoprecipitable by antibody to the T2 phage synthase (Chu et al., 1985). The NH,-TS product is encoded by all

constructs carrying the intact exon I subsegment (Fig. 4, lane ExI; Fig. 5, constructs 1, 2, 3,4 and 7). The predicted Pn, of NH,-TS from the sequence data of the exon I ORF is 21200 (Chu et al., 1984). The discrepancy in size between this value and the apparent M, of 24000 to 25 000 for NH,-TS in these gels (Fig. 4) most likely reflects the spurious migration properties of this protein species. Such migration artifacts are common in gel systems of this type (Belfort, 1978). Synthesis of NH,-TS from the intact exon I subsegment has also been observed in the in vitro system (Chu et al., 1985). In these latter experiments the immunoprecipitability of NH,-TS with TS antibody has been shown and its structural identity to a portion of the mature enzyme demonstrated by CNBr fragmentation. The data in Fig. 5 further indicate that polypeptide X, produced by constructs 1, 3, 6 and 8, is encoded by the region 3' to the C-terminal coding sequence of td, since it is both absent in construction 2 and present in construction 3. These data also demonstrate that polypeptide X is not required for td gene expression, since the mature synthase is produced by construct 2, despite the absence of product X. Species X may well correspond to the 11.3kDa polypeptide Y observed by Mileham et al. (1980) using A-td subclones. The dispensibility of 3' sequences to td expression is also demonstrated by construct 7, wherein deletion of the 3' portion of the exon II coding sequence results in a mature, albeit truncated tdgene product of the predicted size. Deletion into the 5' portion of the td gene abolishes expression of both NH,-TS and mature enzyme products (construct 6), as anticipated from loss of the translations start signal. No intron polypeptide has been observed, either with this subclone, with constructs carrying a smaller intron-containing subfragment (Fig. 4, lane In; Fig. 5, construct 5) or with the intact gene (Fig. 4, lane Td; Fig. 5, constructs 1 and 2) despite the occurrence of a 735-nt ORF within the intron (F.K.C., G.F. Maley, D.K. West, M. Belfort and F. Maley, submitted). Neither is a product corresponding only to the exon II coding sequences detectable. As in this in vivo system, the only two observable td-specific protein products synthesized in vitro are TS and the exon I-encoded NH,-TS (Chu et al., 1985).

In contrast, mature enzyme appeared with a delay of 3 min after temperature shift and increased to a maximum at 15 min post-induction before its level of synthesis decreased. Oligonucieotide protection assays specific for unspliced RNA sequences or for the mature mRNA were used to monitor unspliced and spliced RNAs for the first 15 min of induction (Fig. 8). Primary transcript levels, like NH,-TS were already elevated by 1 min, whereas spliced mRNA appearance was delayed like that of the mature enzyme. Furthermore, the spliced message showed a steady increase for 15 min post-induction, mirroring the synthesis of its synthase product. These data suggest that immediately after the td gene begins to be expressed, NH,-TS is made at high levels from the primary transcript. Processing of this primary transcript to the mRNA that encodes TS would first result in loss

was observed over a 20-min chase period. This result argues against a possible precursor-product relationship between NH,-TS and TS at the protein levei, consistent with RNA processing as the pathway for expression of the mature TS gene product (Belfort et al., 1985; Chu et al., 1985). The stability of these species also facilitates the interpretation of pulse-labeling experiments which monitor the rate of synthesis of the protein products (Fig. 7). The temporal disparity between the appearances of NH,-TS and TS was shown by pulse-labeling pKTd2 polypeptides at various times after induction of tn'specific transcription (Fig. 7). NH,-TS appear-

by the finding that the drop in NH,-TS synthesis was less dramatic upon induction of a pKC30-Exon I subclone which does not support synthesis of spliced RNA. Here a decline of approx. 10% was observed for NH,-TS, as opposed to a roughly three-fold decrease over the 15-min induction period when expressed from the intact td gene (not shown). Thus the decline in NH,-TS synthesis appears to be dependent upon sequences 3' to exon I and no doubt reflects processing of the primary transcript. It thus appears that intron excision triggers the switch from NH,-TS synthesis from the primary transcript to mature synthase production from the ligated exons.

Despite the ability of td RNA to self-splice in vitro (Chu et al., 198.Q there are several reasons to suspect that accessory factors may facilitate the in vivo reaction. For example, aIthough the td gene is transcribed and the intron is excised after T4 infection in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol, exon ligation is completely inhibited under these conditions (Belfort et al., 1985). While we have not ruled out direct inhibition of ligation by chloramphenicol, we favor the explanation that the absence of mature mRNA results from inhibition of synthesis of a phage function or labile host factor involved in splicing. Additionally, the RNA component M 1 of E. co& RNase P is catalytically active in vitro (Guerrier-Takada et al., 1983), although the protein component enhances in vitro Ml reactivity and is required for enzyme activity in vivo (Kole et al., 1980). F~ermore, in several fungal mitochondrial systems, certain RNAs self-splice in vitro despite the existence of unlinked mutations that inhibit splicing in vivo (Garriga and Lambowitz, 1984; Van der Horst and Tabak, 1985). Taken together these considerations imply that while RNA may have catalytic properties in vitro, the reactions are facilitated by proteins in vivo. The nature of protein factors, if any, involved in td RNA splicing remains unclear. Our study indicates that neither of the well-known TCencoded RNA processing functions, RNA ligase and polynucleotide kinase, seems to alter splicing efficiency (Fig. 2). Moreover, host cells lacking endonucleases

relative to that of TS suggests that RNA processing acts as a switch, turning off NH,-TS synthesis, while simultaneously furnishing the template for TS production. This provides us with a novel prokaryotic regulatory mechanism, whereby two products of the same gene, with the same primary transcript and identical transcriptional and translational controls, are expressed independently, in an RNA-splicingdependent fashion. Such a process may be a primitive form of alternate splicing as seen in many eukaryotic systems, in which more than one protein product may be encoded by the same (reviewed by Sharp, 1985). split gene

tions in the phage or host cell that affect td expression. The two protein products revealed by polypeptide analysis are the TS subunit, the mature product of the two exon sequences, and NH,-TS, the NH,-terminal end of the synthase encoded by exon I (Figs. 4 and 5). Whereas mature enzyme has been identified previously in &Td constructs (Mileham et al., 1980) and with pKTd2 (Belfort et al., 1983), the NH,-TS product has heretofore been noted only in vitro (Chu et al., 1985). The kinetics of synthesis (Fig. 7) and decay (Fig. 6) of these two species provide evidence against any direct precursor-product relationship. Rather, these data are consistent with NH,-TS being a product of the exon I ORF, which would be predicted to exist only in the primary transcript (Fig. 1). Processing of the precursor into mature mRNA, by elimination of the intron, is thought to be responsible for shutting off NH,-TS synthesis, since the UAA stop codon at the 5'-intron boundary is removed from its termination site at the carboxyterminus of NH,-TS. The subsequent ligation step would then be responsible for generating the mRNA template for mature enzyme synthesis. Consistent with the above model for NH,-TS and synthase expression, are the following findings: (1) the kinetics of synthesis of the particular RNAs and their putative protein products from the cloned gene are similar (Figs. 7 and 8); (2) after early synthesis, the rapid decline of NH,-TS from the intact td gene (Fig. 7) is less dramatic in clones which cannot support mature mRNA production (not shown); (3) whereas the relationship between NH,-TS production and synthesis of the primary transcript after T4 infection remains to be determined, the appearance of mature enzyme is delayed when encoded by the intact phage (Belfort et al., 1985; Trimble et al., 1972) or by the cloned gene (Fig. 7). The delay presumably reflects the time required to generate the spliced template.
