In previous work the metal-polypeptide co-ordinative bonds in the major protein species of a reconstituted ] "3Cd,]metallothionein-2 preparation from rabbit liver in aqueous solution were determined, the secondary polypeptide structure was found to contain several halfturns and 3,,-helical segments, and a preliminary characterization of the overall polypeptide backbone fold in the b-domain containing the three-metal cluster, and the a-domain containing the four-metal cluster, was obtained. Using a new, more extensive set of nuclear magnetic resonance data these earlier structures were improved by new structure calculations. The new experimental data consist of distance constraints from measurements of nuclear Overhauser effects, and dihedral angle constraints derived from both coupling constants and nuclear Overhauser effects. The structure calculations were performed with the program DISMAN. Since no information on the orientation of the two domains relative to each other could be obtained, the structure calculations were performed separately for the cc-domain and the p-domain. The average of the pairwise root-mean-square distances among the 29 structures with the least residual violations of input constraints was 2.9 A for the p-domain and 1.4 A for the a-domain (1 A = 0.1 nm). The overall chirality of the polypeptide fold is right-handed for the /?-domain and left-handed for the a-domain. For each of the seven metal ions the local chirality of the co-ordination of the four cysteinyl SY atoms is clearly defined. The improved structures of both domains show the previously noted differences relative to the recently published crystal structure of metallothionein-2a
from rat liver.

(a) 12.m.r. experiments

thioneins have been investigated independently in single crystals by X-ray crystallography (Furey et al., 1986, 1987) and in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (Neuhaus et aE., 1984, 1985; Frey et al., 1985; Wagner et al., 1986u, 1987a; VaSBk et al., 1987). The structures obtained from the two investigations markedly different. are The differences are primarily on the level of the metalpolypeptide co-ordinative bonds, which for the solution structure were determined directly by ' ' 3Cd-' H heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy (Frey et al., 1985). For the polypeptide conformation in solution only preliminary results were presented (Braun et al., 1986), which nonetheless indicated the presence of a novel secondary structure element, the half-turn (Wagner et al., 1986a). In view of the considerable general interest raised by the structural investigations with metallothioneins we started a new round of data collection to obtain a more precise characterization of the polypeptide fold in the solution conformation of rabbit MT-2a. A major element of the new experiments presented here is that a homogeneous preparation liver was obtained by of rabbit ] `13Cd,]MT-2a HPLC purification. In all our previous investigations the MT-2a samples contained a minor admixture of a homologous protein (Neuhaus et al., 1985; Wagner et al., 19863). While sequence-specific assignments of the proton resonances could be obtained (Wagner et al., 19866) and the metalpolypeptide co-ordination elucidated (Frey et al., 1985), the presence of this impurity, now designated MT-2b (Kagi & Kojima, 1987), left the assignments of numerous NOESY cross peaks ambiguous, so that they could not be included in the input for the structure calculations (Braun et al., 1986). With the new homogeneous sample a larger number of NOE distance constraints could be identified. Additional structural constraints were obtained from a combined analysis of spin-spin coupling constants and intra-residue and sequential NOES, which yielded constraints on backbone dihedral angles 4 and @, and side-chain dihedral angles x1. All t'hese constraints were used as the input for a much larger number of structure calculations with the program DTSMAN (Braun & Go, 1985) than in the previous study (Braun et al., 1986). This paper presents a description of the rabbit liver MT-2a solution conformation thus obtained. The description covers separately the B-domain, which includes residues 1 to 30 and the three-metal cluster, and the a-domain, which includes residues 31 to 61 and the four-metal cluster, since the relative orientations of the two domains are not constrained by the experimental data.

All 2D n.m.r. spectra were recorded on a Bruker WM500 spectrometer. ZQF-COSY (Piantini et al., 1982; Shaka & Freeman, 1983; Rance et al., 1983) and NOESY (Jeener et al., 1979; Kumar et al., 1980) spectra were recorded as described. For all experiments quadrature detection was used in both dimensions, with timeproportional phase-incrementation of the first pulse (Marion & Wiithrich, 1983), and the carrier was placed in the centre of the spectrum. For the spectra recorded in H,O, the spectral width was 6024 Hz in both dimensions. 512 and 280 t,-values were recorded for the 2QFCOSY and for the NOESY spectra, respectively, with 4096 and 1024 data points along t2. Prior to Fourier transformation, the time domain data were multiplied with phase-shifted sine bell window functions (Wagner et al.. 1978). using phase shifts of n/10 and n/40 in the t, and t, dimensions, respectively. With zero-filling the time domain data were then extended to 1024 points in t, and 4096 points in t,. For the spectra recorded in `Hz0 a spectral width of 3788 Hz was used in both dimensions, otherwise the data handling was the same as for the spectra in H,O. All NOESY spectra were recorded with a relaxation delay of 2.5 s to avoid a bias in the comparison of the NOESY cross peak intensities which might arise due to incomplete relaxation. In total, a set of 9 spectra was used for the collection of the input for the structure calculations. Three NOESY spectra with mixing times of 60, 120 and 250 ms and 1 2&F-COSY spectrum each in Hz0 and in `H,O. were recorded. All these spectra were recorded with reconstituted, isotopically homogeneous ["%d,]MT-2a to resolve ambiguities of cross-peak assignments with cysteine B-protons.

(b) Assignment of NOESY crosspeaks The chemical shifts of all protons in rabbit liver MT-2a were published elsewhere (Wagner et al., 1986b), and these were used to assign those NOESY cross peaks that had not been used for obtaining the resonance assignments (Wiithrich, 1986). The assignment of NOESY cross peaks was mainly based on spectra recorded at) 14°C. For the majority of these cross peaks both chemical shifts which define their locations were unique, and the peak assignment was straightforward. Three criteria were employed to arrive at unambiguous assignments in those cases where in the spectra at 14°C one or both chemical shifts were degenerate. In case of ambiguities about assignments to cysteine p-protons, NOESY spectra of ["%d,]MT-2a were consulted, where the cysteine B-proton resonances can be identified on the basis of the heteronuclear coupling to ' 13Cd. In other situations. recorded at different temperatures were spectra consulted, where degeneracies of the chemical shifts of 2 or several amide protons were often resolved, as was described in detail by Wagner et al. (198%). Finally. residual ambiguities could in most instances be resolved through the analysis of the initial structure calculations, where erroneous assignments would consistently give rise to major violations of distance constraints (see also the

and Methods

Rabbit liver MT-2a was isolated from rabbits injected subcutaneously 15 times in 2 to 3-day intervals with 1 mg of CdClz per kg body weight (Kimura et al., 1979). The MT-2 isoforms were separated as described (Kiigi et al..

Appendix). For a small number of cross peaks the assignments remained ambiguous according to these criteria; these were not used in the structure calculations.
(c) Distance constraints from

NOES Y

A semi-quantitative correlation between NOESY crosspeak intensities and `H-`H distance constraints was obtained from comparison of the NOESY spectra recorded with different mixing times, and from calibrations based on standard distances in protein structures (Wiithrich. 1986). The quantitative determination of the cross-peak intensities was based on counting the exponentially spaced contour levels. First, the 60 ms NOESY spectrum was found to have a cutoff distance of around 3.0 A (1 A = 0.1 nm). This value was obtained from the number of intraresidue NH-H" cross peaks observed. This distance can be at most 2.9 A. In the 60 ms NOESY spectrum 43 out of the possible 59 such cross peaks were observed, with 1 to 3 contour levels. The presence of another 8 of these peaks cannot be excluded, but due either to overlap with other peaks or to partial saturation by the water irradiation, they could not be identified unambiguously. The remaining 8 NH-H" intraresidual cross peaks were definitely absent, indicating that the cutoff distance would be below 2.9 d. To allow for some influence of mobility (Braun et d, 1981) and diverse relaxation effects we equated cross peaks with an intensity of 1 contour level at a mixing time of 60 ms with an upper distance limit of 3.1 A. Using the pm6 dependence of the cross relaxation, cross peaks with 2 contour levels at a mixing time of 60 ms were equated with an upper distance limit of 2.7 & and those with 3 or more contour levels with an upper distance limit of 2.4 A. For a similar evaluation of the cross peaks at' a mixing time of 120 ms the sequential distance d,, bet,ween H" of residue i and NH of residue i+ 1 was chosen. d,, depends on the torsion angle JI and is always shorter than 3.6 A (Wiithrich; 1986). In MT-2a there are 58 sequential daN relations. Of these 39 were observed at 120 ms with an intensity of 1 to 4 contour levels. Twelve NOESY cross peaks corresponding to d,, could not be identified uniquely due to resonance overlap, and 7 were definitely absent. indicating that the cutoff distance was somewhat below 3.6 A. To allow for other effects which might influence the cross-peak intensities we used an upper distance limit of 4.0 A for all cross peaks which were observed in the 120 ms spectrum but not in the 60 ms spectrum. In NOESY spectra with a 250 ms mixing time one expects yet additional cross peaks due to both the longer time available for the build-up of direct NOES and to spin diffusion. In particular, the 250 ms spectra of MT-2a contained a significantly larger number of longrange NOEs. The upper distance limit for cross peaks observed only in the 250 ms spectrum was set to 5.5 A. This limit was chosen somewhat arbitrarily to allow for possible effects of spin diffusion. An indirect justification came from the fact that the DISMAN calculations could find structures consistent with all these constraints. (d) Measurement of spin-spin
coupling constants

was 0.28 Hz/point. 3Juscoupling constants were measured in a phase-sensitive ZQF-COSY spectrum of MT-2a in *H,O using cross sections along I+ with a final digital resolution of 0.40 Hz/point. The J-values were obtained as the distance between the antiphase peak components. No corrections were made for cancellation effects due to large line widths (Neuhaus et al., 1985).
(e) Stereospeci$c assignments of fi-methylene protons and

determination of dihedral angle constraints The dihedral angles 4, I++and 1' can in principle be determined by measuring the corresponding vicinal spinspin coupling constants and the intensities of NOE cross peaks. Relationships between 4 and `JHN.. and between x1 and `J,,, respectively, are well known (Bystrov, 1976; DeMarco et aE., 1978a,b; Arseniev et al., 1984; Pardi et al.. 1984). However, the Karplus-type equations have in general multiple solutions, and the determination of x1 requires that the prochiral b-methyl protons are individually assigned. For numerous residues in MT-2a this was achieved by combined use of the spin-spin coupling constants and intra-residual as well as sequential NOES. This approach was applied in a similar fashion to the proteins BPTI by Wagner et aZ. (19876) and Eglin by Hyberts et al. (1987). The definition of the 3 rotamer positions HBg+, HBEand Ho', and the positions of the prochiral protons Ha2 and HB3 for the 3 values 6OO",180" and -60" of the dihedral angle x1 are given in Fig. 1. If the treatment is restricted to L-amino acids and the peptide groups are assumed to be planar, i.e. w = 180", then the intensities of the NOESY cross peaks between NHi or NH, +l and HT, HtZ and HF3 are related to the torsion angles 4, II, and x1 (Fig. 2). Clearly, in principle there should be a sufficient number of experimental measurements to solve t,he problem of characterizing the dihedral angles from the qualitative differences between the distances from NH, or NHi+l to the 3 staggered rotamer proton positions HfgC, Hbg- and HP in the sterically allowed regions for the dihedral angles (Fig. 2). In practice, however, the data collection is limited by several factors. (1) To prevent falsification of the NOE distance constraints by spin diffusion one is restricted to NOESY spectra recorded with short mixing times of less than 60 ms. Only cross peaks corresponding to distances shorter than about 3.0 to 3.5 A could thus be detected with our spectrometers, which does not cover the full range of the intra-residual and sequential distances (Fig. 2). (2) The typical line widths in small proteins prevent measurements of coupling constants smaller than about 5 Hz (Neuhaus et al., 1985; Wiithrich, 1986). (3) The analysis of x1 is only meaningful if the side-chain in question is locked in a

sensitive 2&F-COSY spectrum of MT-2a in H,O, using cross sections taken along the w,-axis (Marion & Wiithrich, 1983). To achieve a high digital resolution, the cross sections were subjected to an inverse Fourier transformation, zero-filled to 32,000 data points, and Fourier transformed. The resulting final digital resolution

unique conformation about ,yi, rather than presenting a dynamic equilibrium involving all 3 staggered rotamers. These 2 situations can in many cases be distinguished from measurements of the 2 coupling constants from H" to the 2 P-methylene protons (Nagayama & Wiithrich, 1981). If both a@ coupling constants are smaller than 5 Hz, the side-chain is in a gauche-gauche conformation, with x1 near 60". If 1 of the 2 coupling constants is larger than 10 Hz, then the second a-/l coupling constant must be smaller than 5 Hz, which corresponds to the guuchetrans or tram-gauche conformers, with x1 either near 180" or near -6OO". If the a-/l coupling constants are in the range of 5 to 9 Hz, one cannot distinguish, from the coupling constants alone, between a unique conformer or rotational mobility around x', and these cases have not been further investigated here. Measurement of "Jmls enables one to distinguish between the truns position of a P-proton relative to H" and the 2 gauche positions (Fig. 1). This can be applied directly in the residues Val, Ile and Thr, which contain a fi-methine proton. For residues with P-methylene groups the problem to be solved then consists of distinguishing between the 2 gauche positions g+ and g-. Fig. 2(a) shows that in the sterically allowed regions for 4 the intraresidual distance from the amide proton to H"+ is always about 05 A shorter than that to HBg-. Therefore, the conformation gft is characterized by 2 strong NH,-Hf NOESY cross peaks, and tg- by 1 strong and 1 weak NH,-Hf cross peak. If these NOESY cross peaks are resolved the conformers g+t and tg- can thus be distinguished, and hence the stereospecific assignments for HBZ and HP3 will be obtained. Otherwise, the sequential distances d,, can, in certain situations, provide the information needed (Fig. 2(b)). If the backbone dihedral angle + is in the allowed region from -70" to -40". the distances daCg+jN and do,,-,, have similar values. Both conformations g+t and tg- therefore have the same pattern of a weak and a strong HP-NH,,, NOESY cross peak and an unambiguous distinction is not possible. If $ is in the range from about 120" to 180" and - 170" to - 180", the sequential distance from the

amide proton to Hflg- is significantly shorter than that to Hbgc. Correspondingly, the g+t conformation is characterized by 2 weak d,, NOESY cross peaks and tg- by a strong and a weak peak, which can be used to obtain the stereospecific assignments. These arguments are qualitatively valid also if the side-chains are not rigidly locked in unique rotation states, but allowed to undergo rapid rotational motions of up to +30" about any specified state (see also Nagayama & Wiithrich, 1981). Constraints on the torsion angle 1/1were obtained for X-Pro dipeptide segments, where 2 strong NOES between the a-proton of the residue X and the 2 d-proton of Pro are indicative for a $ value between 60 and 180". (f)
Distance geometry

culculations

The program DTSMAN (Braun & Go, 1985) was used for the distance geometry calculations of MT-2a structures from the n.m.r. data. The input of NOE distance constraints was relative to pseudo-atoms replacing methylene and methyl groups (Wiithrich et al., 1983). The stereospecific assignments described above were used to obtain dihedral angle constraints from the spin-spin coupling constants and the short-range NOES. These angular constraints were used as additional input for DISMAN as described in detail elsewhere (Braun. 1987). A special comment must be added on the input format for the structural constraints imposed by the co-ordinative bonds, which cadmium-sulphur corresponds to that used previously (Braun et al., 1986) and is summarized in Table 1. Since DISMAN operates in angular space. single atoms cannot be handled. Therefore a pseudo-atom, Cd*, was attached to Sy of each Cys residue, with a bond length of 2.6 A representing the coordinat'ive metal-sulphur linkage. Since the 20 Cd' pseudoatoms (C in Table 1) must represent 7 metal ions, an upper limit of 0.1 A is imposed on the distance between any 2 Cdd which correspond to the same Cd ion. For bridging cysteines, which are identified by + in Table 1, the bond to the second metal ion is enforced by imposing a distance of 2.6 A on the metal-sulphur

Finally, tetrahedral symmetry of the 4 sulphur ligands around each metal ion is enforced by imposing a fixed distance between each pair of sulphur atoms bound to the same Cd ion.

Our previous investigations of rabbit liver MT-2a had been hampered by the presence of a minor admixture of a homologous protein in the MT-2a preparations (Wagner et al., 1986b; Neuhaus et al., 1985), so that for a number of NOESY cross peaks it was difficult to decide whether they belonged to the major or minor protein species. The presence of this impurity was most clearly manifested in the spectral SQF-COSY region containing the aH-PCH, cross peaks of alanine and the /?H-yCH, cross peaks of threonine (Neuhaus et al., 1985). These cross peaks have narrow line widths and are outstandingly intense, so that they can be observed for proteins present at low concentration. For the HPLC-purified MT-2a used in the present study this spectral region contained 12 cross peaks, which correspond to nine alanine and three threonine residues (Fig. 3). In contrast to the same spectral region shown in Figure 8 of Neuhaus et al. (1985) there are no additional peaks with weaker intensity. We estimate that the admixture of MT-2b or any

Prior to this experiment all labile protons were exchanged against deuterons. This 250 ma spectrum was recorded in a series with 2 spectra with mixing times of 60 ma and 120 ms, without removing the sample from the spectrometer: 400 t, values were recorded with 160 scans each. Before the Fourier transformation the time domain data were truncated in the same way as for Fig. 4, and the spectra were then analysed in an analogous way to those of Fig. 4.

other single protein in the preparation used here amounts to less than 3% of the MT-2a concentration, whereas in the previously used samples it was of the order of 5 to 15%. With the availability of this homogeneous protein preparation nearly all NOESY cross peaks could~ be assigned, yielding a more extensive set of distance constraints than in the previous preliminary determination of the polypeptide fold (Braun et al., 1986).

(b) Input for the distance geometry calculations The 28 cadmium-cysteine co-ordinative bonds identified by heteronuclear [ l1 %d, `HICOSY (Frey et al., 1985) were used in the input as described in Materials and Methods (Table 1). NOE distance constraints were collected from two sets of NOESY spectra recorded, respectively, in H,O and 2H20 solution with mixing times of 60,

The amino acid residues are identified either by the 3-letter symbol or the l-letter symbol followed by a number indicating the position in the amino acid sequence. HN stands for amide proton, HA for C" proton, HB for C@proton, HG for Cy proton, and HD for cd proton. The following upper-case letters indicate pseudo atoms which substitute for a group of 2 or more protons; lower-case letters indicate that the distance constraint has been modified to account for the use of the pseudo atom (Wiithrich et al., 1983). M replaces the 3 protons of a methyl group and is located in the centre of the 3 proton positions, with the correction m = 1.0 A. P replaces the protons of a methylene group and is located in the centre between the 2 proton positions, with the same correction as for methyl groups. Distance constraints to the amide protons in the side-chain of Asn are referred to the amide nitrogen atom ND, with the correction m. The rows following the 3-letter symbol for the amino acids list all the distance constraints that involve hydrogen atoms of this residue. For each residue the distance constraints are grouped into 3 classes, which are presented in 3 columns. Sequential backbone constraints are those between backbone protons (for Pro also Cd protons) in sequentially neighbouring residues. Mediumrange backbone and long-range backbone constraints are between the same proton types in residues that are not nearest neighbours in the sequence. Constraints with side-chains are all those that have not been listed elsewhere. All entries appear twice, once for each residue concerned. In each column, the first entry identifies a hydrogen atom (or pseudo atom) in the amino acid identified by the a-letter symbol. The second and third entries indicate a hydrogen atom in a different residue to which a distance constraint has been observed. The fourth entry is the distance constraint in A, possibly with symbols indicating that 1 or 2 corrections were added to the NOESY distance constraint to allow for the use of pseudo atoms. The fifth entry, in parentheses, lists the chemical shifts of the interacting protons.

120 and 250 milliseconds. Figures 4 and 5 show the spectral regions of the spectra in Hz0 and 2H20, which were most, extensively analysed in the two solvents. Table 2 lists the distance constraints that were derived from these data with the procedures described in Materials and Methods. With the exceptions of Ile49, where the complete side-chain is constrained, and single NOE with the side-chain amide protons of Asn4 and CYH2 of Pro39, no NOES were observed with side-chain protons beyond the p position. Mainly for this reason no intraresidual NOE constraints were included in Table 2 or used explicitly in the input. (Note, however, that intraresidual NOES with the P-methylene protons were used for obtaining the dihedral angle constraints

(see Figs 1 and 2 and Materials and Methods). the distance constraints with Throughout, methylene protons are listed relative to the pseudoatom positions (Wiithrich et al., 1983). Even though for were obtained assignments stereospecific numerous /?-protons, these were only used in the determination of the dihedral angle constraints and not for obtaining more precise NOE distance constraints. Table 3 lists the amide proton-a-proton and a-proton-@-proton coupling constants measured in rabbit MT-2a. The DISMAN program can accept the dihedral angle constraints obtained from these coupling constants and from short-range NOES in the form of allowed intervals as input data. These

Initial calculations using the program DISMAN (Braun & Go, 1985) were used to check the NOESY cross-peak assignments for self-consistency and to eliminate typing errors in the preparation of the input data (see also the Appendix). With the resulting final input 200 calculations were started with different random starting structures. Since there are no constraints between the c1 and /?-domains, separate calculations were performed for the two domains. After eliminating those calculations which converged poorly at low levels of the variable target function, calculations up to level 32 were completed for 87 structures for the /?-domain, and 84 structures for the a-domain. For each of the two domains the 20 solutions with the smallest residual error functions were then selected for further analysis of the structures. In Tables 4 and 5 the 20 best structures were ordered according to the sum of the residual distance violations, which range from 5.5 to 8.5 ir for the P-domain, and from 10.9 to 19.8 A for the a-domain. For each structure the number of residual distance and dihedral angle violations of the size indicated at the top are listed. There are no NOE distance constraint violations greater than 1-O A in either cluster, and there are only a few greater than O-3 A. The constraints violations arising from the tetrahedral cadmium-sulphur coordination (Table 1) were somewhat more heavily especially in the a-domain. These violated, violations concern, in most cases, the constraints which enforce the tetrahedral symmetry about the Cd ions, whereas the cadmium-sulphur distances of 2.6 A were satisfied throughout to within 0.1 A. The larger number of constraint violations in the a-domain are probably a consequence of the more complex double-ring geometry of its metal cluster (see below). In both domains the numbers of nonbonded contact and torsion angle constraint violations are small. In the b-domain no nonbonded contact violations exceed 0.3 g in any of the 20 structures, and in the a-domain only a few of the structures contained one or two non-bonded contact violations in the range 0.3 to 0.4 A. Overall, Tables 4 and 5 show that the 20 best DISMAN solutions for the two separate domains in rabbit MT-2a represent structures that satisfy the input constraints of Tables 1 to 3. In Figures 6 and 7 the 20 structures of Tables 4 and 5 have been

superimposed for pairwise minimum RMSD with the best structure. Clearly, all 20 solutions represent the same global fold of the polypeptide chain (Fig. 6). The structure of the /?-domain is quite well defined, except for the first four residues which are only poorly constrained and were not included in the RMSD tit, and to some extent the loop between Cys7 and Cysl3. The dispersion among the 20 solutions for the a-domain is significantly smaller than for the B-domain, showing that this structure is more precisely characterized by the n.m.r. data. Figure 7 shows that the six-ring formed by the three Cd ions and the three bridging S atoms adopts a nearly ideal boat conformation in all 20 structures of the three-metal cluster. The two fused six-rings in the four-metal cluster both have somewhat distorted boat conformations. The local chirality of the sulphur co-ordination is uniquely defined for all seven Cd ions, whereas

there is some variance among the calculated structures with regard to some Sy positions. The visual impression from Figures 6 and 7, suggesting that the input of Tables 1 to 3 provides a sufficiently dense network of structural constraints to uniquely characterize the molecular structure of MT-2a, and that the a-domain is more precisely constrained, is confirmed by the RMSD values listed in Table 6. The average RMSD for the backbone heavy-atoms, all b-carbons and the metal-sulphur cluster is 2.9 A for the /?-domain and I.4 A for the a-domain, and in each domain virtually identical values were found for the backbone atoms alone. In contrast to the overall structure the metal and sulphur atoms taken separately give larger RMSD values in the fourmetal cluster than in the three-metal cluster, which again coincides with the visual impression from Figure 7.

4. Discussion
A survey of the rabbit liver MT-2a structure obtained with the procedures described in the preceding sections is afforded by Figure 8, which shows a stereo view of the heavy-atom positions in the polypeptide backbone and the 20 cysteinyl sidechains, as well as the seven metal ions. (a) The global polypeptide fold in rabbit MT-2a The polypeptide fold can be described as a series of loops of variable length, which have both ends
tied to a metal ion in the same cluster via the co-

ones of these loops are least well defined by the present n.m.r. data, as evidenced by the larger dispersion among the 20 structures shown in Figure 6. In the p-domain this applies to the N terminus, where Met 1, Asp2 and Pro3 are not fixed relative to the bulk of the molecule either by a metal-Cys bond or by long-range NOES (Tables 1 and 2), the eight-residue loop bounded by Cys7 and Cysl3, and to a lesser extent the five-residue loop from Cysl5 to Cvsl9. Four three-residue loops Cys-X-Cys in the positions 5 to 7, 13 to 15, 19 to 21 and 24 to 26, and the two four-residue loops 15 to 19 and 26 to 29 are noticeably more tightly constrained by the n.m.r.
data. While part of these differences in the precision

Around the four-metal cluster the polypeptide forms a left-handed fold, in contrast to the

their sequence numbers the Cys residues around the cadmium determine a right or a left-handed loop, the local chirality around cadmium ions I, II, III and IV is right-handed, and around cadmium V, VI and VII left-handed. These local chiralities could not be directly inferred from the n.m.r. data, but result from the combination of all data through the DISMAN calculations. As mentioned previously (Braun et al., 1986), regular tetrahedral symmetry of the metal co-ordination was assumed in the input (Table 1). Overall, this assumption, which is supported by a variety of experimental observations (see references cited by Braun et al., 1986), was found to be compatible with the present n.m.r. data. The residual violations of those constraints that were used to enforce regular tetrahedral co-ordination geometry (Tables 4 and 5) might indicate deviations from a perfect tetrahedron, but the co-ordination geometry could not be determined more precisely directly from the experimental data of Tables 1 to 3.

(c) Secondary structure and intramolecular hydrogen bonds Figure 9 presents a statistical analysis of the 4 and $ angles as a function of the sequence numbers aimed at the recognition of secondary structural elements in all 20 DISMAN structures of Tables 4 and 5. This procedure checks in an objective way the occurrence of the secondary structure elements 3,,-helix and half-turn, which were previously found by an empirical pattern recognition approach to occur in rabbit MT-2a (Wagner et al., 1986a). Figure 9(a) is a plot of the deviations of 4' and $ from the ideal values for half-turns (Wagner et al., 1986a), and Figure 9(b) shows the same for values (Ai) 310-helices. Low standard deviation indicate the occurrence of a secondary structure element in all, or nearly all, of the examined 20 structures. The significance of these secondary structure identifications is obviously related to the variability of the local polypeptide backbone conformation among the 20 DISMAN structures, as expressed by the plots of the standard deviations of I#Jand $ versus the amino acid sequence (Fig. 9(c)). was taken to separate Special consideration independent variations of *i and 4i+1 from the effect of tilting the intervening peptide plane (for details see the legend to Fig. 9). Wherever the filled squares indicate lower values of gi than the open squares, the dihedral angle variation is partly caused by tilting of the peptide planes. The plots shown in Figure 9(c) show the largest standard deviations for the longest peptide loops separating metal-bound cysteine residues. This coincides with the observations made with the global fits of the 20 DISMAN structures in Figure 6, which show the largest dispersion for the same polypeptide segments. In Figure 9(b) 310-helices are manifested by several sequentially adjoining low values of Ai. This is observed for residues 42 to 45 and 58 to 60. Both of these locations were recognized as 3,,-helices by the empirical pattern recognition method (Wagner et al., 1986a). The present approach for secondary structure identification receives further support from Figure IO(a), where the peptide segment 42 to 47 in the 20 DISMAN structures (Tables 4 and 5) is

superimposed on a segment of regular 3io-helix. The close fit clearly confirms that this segment forms a 3,,,-helix in the solution conformation of the individual MT-2a. An attempt to identify hydrogen bonds in the 3,,-helices, using the same criteria as in other structures determined by the same method (Williamson et al., 1985; Wagner et al., 1987b) failed to provide unambiguous answers. To a large part this is due to the fact that to prevent dissociation of the Cd ions, all n.m.r. experiments with MT-2a were done at neutral pH, where the amide proton exchange is intrinsically more rapid than in the acidic range (Wiithrich, 1986). This makes a delineation of hydrogen bonds by the criterion of slowed exchange with the solvent difficult or, as in the present case, impossible. Furthermore, the 31,,-helical structures are somewhat distorted (Fig. 10(a)), and as a result the hydrogen bond lengths and bond angles deviate sufficiently from the regular values so that they are not unambiguously identified by a standard search procedure. In Figure 9(a) isolated residues with a low value of Ai indicate the formation of a half-turn by the four residues i- 1 to i + 2, as explained in more detail in the Figure legend. Half-turns are thus indicated for the peptide segments 18 to 21, 20 to 23, 23 to 26, 40 to 43, and 47 to 50. Figure 9(a) affords also a comparison with the earlier results obtained using an empirical pattern recognition approach (Wagner et al., 1986a). The proposed three half-turns in the segment 1 to 14 are not clearly indicated by small Ai values, which is explained by the high variability of the structures in this part of the sequence (Figs 6(a) and 9(c)). Between residues 18 and 22 there are two instead of one previously predicted half-turn. Residues 38 to 41 were identified as either a type II tight turn or a half-turn. Tndividual analysis of the involved dihedral angles now indicated that the conformation is that of a type II tight turn followed by a half-turn. For the segments 23 to 26, 33 to 36 and 47 to 50 both methods identify a half-turn. While the identification of the half-turn 33 to 36 is not very clear in Figure 9(a), a superposition with a standard half-turn (Fig. IO(b)) provides unambiguous support for its presence. In conclusion, the formation of half-turns, which were previously identified as a novel secondary structure element first described in MT-2a (Wagner et al., 1986a) is confirmed by the objective search method illustrated in Figure 9(a). (d) Relationships between the solution structure of rabbit MT-2a and the crystal structure of rat MT-2a A fundamental difference between the two structures is that 21 of the total of 28 metalcysteine connectivities are with cysteine residues in different sequence positions. For the solution of the metal co structure the identification ordination sites was a result of heteronuclear [i13Cd, `HICOSY experiments (Frey et al., 1985),

These differences obviously carry over to the polypeptide fold. However, shortly before submitting this paper, we were informed that the refinement of the crystal structure was still

in progress, and that a more detailed comparison would be premature (D. Stout, personal communication). The MT-2a solution structure presented here will provide part of the substance for such a comparison in the future. Appendix It is an essential part of any protein structure determination with the methods used here that the structures obtained are checked for consistency with the experimental n.m.r. data, in particular with that data that were not explicitly contained in the input for the structure calculations (Braun eta,?., 1981; Williamsonet al., 1985; A. Kline, W. Braun

& K. Wiithrich, unpublished results). One of these checks is provided by Tables 4 and 5, which list discrepancies between those experimental data that were assigned and analysed to provide structural constraints. As mentioned repeatedly in the main text the input list of Table 2 was completed after several rounds of checking structures, calculated with less extensive sets of input constraints, against t'he experimental spectra in order to obtain additional, unambiguous assignments for NOESY cross peaks that had not been used for the structure determination. Here, we briefly illustrate how the relationships between molecular structures and experimental NOESY spectra were established. At each stage of the rabbit MT-2a structure determination the atom co-ordinates of the DISMAN structures and the chemical shifts known from the assignment of the `H n.m.r. spectrum (Wagner et al., 19866) provided the basis for the checks against the experimental NOESY spectra. In the following we describe an NOE simulation from the final structures of Tables 4 and 5 (Fig. 6). For each pair of protons (or pseudo atoms) in both domains the average, (d) = ((~-~))-l'~, of their distance in the best 20 structures was computed. Each pair of atoms for which this average, (d), was less than 3.5 L%and the sum of(d) plus its standard deviation o was less than 4.0 A, was then represented by a symbol in the w1 -w2 frequency plane. The size of the symbols in this plot of simulated NOE signals (Fig. 11) was chosen proportional to (d). Thus, it reflects the expected intensity of the corresponding NOE peaks in an experimental spectrum. Similar plots with cut-off criteria at longer inter-atomic distances contained additional cross-peaks, as expected. A comparison of the simulated NOE plot shown in Figure 11 with the corresponding region of the experimental NOESY spectra recorded with mixing times of 60, 100 and 250 milliseconds (Fig. 4) showed that all predicted peaks could be observed in at least one of the experiments, except for the seven peaks represented by filled symbols. Four of these involved the side-chain amide protons of Gln46, where the NOES might be quenched by rapid proton exchange. For two other peaks the `H-`H distances have large corresponding, standard deviations among the 20 DISMAN structures, so that the significance of their presence in the computed spectrum is doubtful. The seventh peak corresponds to a distance of 3*3( kO.3) A between Ser58 H" and Cys60 NH, and its absence
must at this point be attributed to an unknown

Figure 11. Positions and approximate intensities of NOESY cross peaks in the wr-o2 region of Fig. 4 predicted using the `H-`H distances in the 20 best DISMAN structures of rabbit MT-2a (Tables 4 and 5) and the `H chemical shifts (Wagner et aZ., 19866). A symbol was plotted at the known chemical shift positions of a pair of protons whenever the average of the distances between them in the set of the 20 structures, (d) = ((re6))- 1'6,was smaller than 3.5 A, and the sum of(d) and its standard deviation u was smaller than 4.0 A. Triangles, diamonds and squares represent intra-residue. sequential and longer-range NOES, respectively. The area of the symbols is approximately proportional to the intensity expected from the distances they represent. Open symbols represent predicted NOE peaks which were actually present in the experimental spectra. Filled symbols represent NOES which were predicted but not present in any of the experimental spectra (see the text).

quenching mechanism. On the other hand the spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 60 milliseconds contained seven extra peaks which are not present in Figure 11. However, these appeared in a simulated NOE plot when the cut-off criteria were increased to (d) s 4.0 A and ((d) +(T) I 4.5 A. The experiment with a 250 millisecond mixing time (Fig. 4) produced nearly all the cross peaks in Figure 11 (besides the 7 peaks corresponding to the filled symbols in Fig. 11, several peaks that had been observed in the spectra recorded with shorter mixing times were absent because of bleaching by the water irradiation), and 59 additional peaks. These additional peaks correspond either to direct NOES with slow build-up rates, or are due mainly to spin-diffusion. Therefore they are not predicted by the protein structures when the cut-off criteria of Figure 11 are used, and the checks must be extended to plots that include representations of longer inter-nuclear distances. Overall, in the present example of rabbit MT-2a the comparisons of NOESY spectra predicted from the structures with the experiments indicated that the final DISMAN results obtained using all the data in Tables 1 to 3 can account for virtually all experimental NOESY cross peaks, and that the NOESY spectrum at 60 milliseconds mixing time was essentially completely analysed. In the MT-2a project the major impact of these attempts at relating the structures directly with the n.m.r. experiments was, however, clearly in the intermediate stages of the structure determination, where they resulted in the identification and unambiguous assignments of numerous NOESY cross peaks which could not be exploited without reference to a low-resolution structure. In future, similar procedures will undoubtedly gain additional importance for the refinement of the final structures, where both static and dynamic aspects might thus become accessible. While a visual presentation, such as Figures 4 and 11, may in many instances be in suitable ways implemented on graphics systems, numerical handling of both the experimental and the computed spectra may be the preferred strategy with systems of increased working when complexity.
