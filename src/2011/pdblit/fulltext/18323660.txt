The crystal structure of the Alba protein (PhoAlba) from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus hori° koshii OT3, was determined at a resolution of 2.8 A. PhoAlba structurally belongs to the = proteins and is similar not only to archaeal homologues but also to RNA-binding proteins, including the C-terminal half of initiation factor 3 (IF3-C) from Bacillus stearothermophilus, an Esherichia coli protein implicated in cell division (Yhhp), and an Arabidopsis protein of unknown function. We found by gel shift assay that PhoAlba interacts with both ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA (PhopRNA) and precursor-tRNATyr (pre-tRNATyr ) in P. horikoshii. However, the addition of PhoAlba to reconstituted particles composed of PhopRNA and four or five protein subunits had little influence on either the pre-tRNA processing activity or the optimum temperature for the processing activity. These results suggest that PhoAlba contributes little to the catalytic activity of P. horikoshii RNase P. Key words: Alba; crystal structure; precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA); Pyrococcus horikoshii; ribonuclease P (RNase P)

Several DNA-binding proteins have been isolated from archaea and extensively characterized in terms of structure and protein-DNA interaction.1) Part of the interest in studying these proteins lies in the possibility of a structural or at least a functional equivalence on the part of one or more of them to the role played by histones in eukaryotic cells. Alba would appear to be a prime candidate for a protein having such a role. Alba was initially identified as 10-kDa proteins present in the
y

chromatin of crenarchaeota, particularly in Sulfolobus species.2,3) Subsequently, it was found that Alba homologs are present not only in crenarchaeota but also in euryarchaeota and in some eukarya. They are small, basic proteins, and they occur as a dimeric form in solution.4) Since Alba binds nonspecifically to doublestranded DNA and is predominantly present in chromatin,4,5) it is thought to play a major role in the architecture of the archaeal chromosome. It was further found that the Alba protein (SsoAlba) from Sulfolobus solfataricus forms a stable complex with an archaeal Sir2 homolog from S. solfataricus, which has histone deacetylase activity, and that acetylation of SsoAlba at Lys16 strongly reduces the affinity of the protein for DNA. Hence, acethylation and deacethylation of SsoAlba, like histone in eukaryotic chromosome, is assumed to play a crucial role in chromatin regulation.6,7) There is, however, evidence that the Alba proteins bind to both DNA and RNA.8) In addition, although Alba is a dominant chromosomal protein in crenarchaeota, studies on the chromatin of eukarya and euryarchaeota have not detected Alba homologs as major constituents of chromosomes in these lineages.9) These findings suggest that highly conserved Alba homologs might have additional functions. Meanwhile, comparative genomics revealed that the protein subunits Rpp20 and Rpp25 of human ribonuclease P (RNase P) belong to the Alba protein family, suggesting that archaeal Alba proteins are the functional equivalent of Rpp20 and/or Rpp25 in archaeal RNase Ps or related ribonucleoprotein complexes.10) Despite this, the involvement of Alba proteins in catalysis by archaeal RNase Ps has not been examined.

RNase P is a ubiquitous trans-acting ribozyme that processes the 50 leader sequence of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA).11,12) Although the functionality of RNase P is similar from bacteria to humans, the chemical composition of this ribozyme differs in three phylogenetic domains of life: eubacteria, archaea, and eukarya.13) Eubacterial RNase P is composed of a catalytic RNA and a single protein subunit,14) while eukaryotic RNase Ps comprise a single RNA moiety and as many as 10 proteins; a highly purified nuclear RNase P from HeLa cells has at least 10 distinct protein subunits, termed Rpp14, Rpp20, Rpp21, Rpp25, Rpp29, Rpp30, Rpp38, Rpp40, hPop1, and hPop5.15­17) Although Rpp21 and Rpp29 are known to be strongly involved in the catalytic activity of human RNase P,18) the functional roles of other human RNase P proteins in RNase P have not been established. It was reported recently that Rpp20 and Rpp25, belonging to the Alba protein family, bind to each other, and that heterodimerization regulates their RNA-binding activity, subcellular localization, and expression, though their catalytic contribution to human RNase P remains unclear.19) Furthermore, a recent study indicates that human nuclear RNase P is required for transcription of tRNA and other small noncoding RNA genes by pol III, and Rpp20 and Rpp25 are expected to play an essential role in this function as chromatinbinding proteins.20) We have found via a reconstitution experiment that RNase P RNA (PhopRNA) and four proteins, PhoPop5, PhoRpp21, PhoRpp29, and PhoRpp30, are essential to the RNase P activity of the Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3.21) The RNase P proteins from P. horikoshii OT3 were designated according to their homology to the corresponding human proteins, and the prefix Pho is added to differentiate them from homologous proteins from other organisms.22) The reconstituted particle (R4P), however, had a lower optimal temperature (around 55  C) than that (70  C) for the authentic RNase P from P. horikoshii. This result suggests that the authentic RNase P has additional components that affect the optimal temperature. Subsequently, a fifth protein, PhoRpp38 (an archaeal homolog of human Rpp38), was found to be involved in elevating the optimal temperature of the reconstituted particle (R-5P).23) Although these results indicate that PhopRNA and five protein subunits reconstitute a RNase P that exhibits enzymatic properties of the authentic enzyme, we could not exclude the possibility of the presence of additional protein components in P. horikoshii RNase P, due to a lack of information about protein subunits of authentic RNase P. During the course of studying P. horikoshii RNase P, we identified the gene PHS053 of Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3,24) the translational product of which shows sequence similarity to those of the Alba family proteins.2,3) Hence it was referred to as PhoAlba. In this study, to provide further structural information about euryarchaeal Alba proteins, we determined the

° crystal structure of PhoAlba at a resolution of 2.8 A with molecular replacement using, the Alba structure (SsoAlba) of S. solfataricus25) as a search model. We found that PhoAlba has a topology similar to archaeal homologs from euryarchaeota as well as crenarchaeota. Further, we tested the involvement of PhoAlba in RNase P activity in the expectation that this would aid in establishing a functional assignment of the Alba proteins in archaeal as well as eukaryotic RNase Ps.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Five RNase P proteins (PhoPop5, PhoRpp21, PhoRpp29, PhoRpp30, and PhoRpp38), PhopRNA, and 32 P-labeled pre-tRNATyr in P. horikoshii were prepared as described previously.21,23) All nucleotide sequence data were cited in the P. horikoshii OT3 genome database (http://www.bio.nite.go.jp). All other chemicals were of analytical grade for biochemical use. Expression and purification of PhoAlba. The P. horikoshii gene (ID code, PHS053) was amplified using a set of oligonucleotides. Cloning and expression of the resulting DNA fragment were done in a manner identical to those described for expression of P. horikoshii RNase P proteins.21,23) E. coli lysate overproducing PhoAlba in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0), containing 200 mM NaCl, was first heated at 80  C for 40 min, and then the supernatant was applied onto a SP-Sepharose FF column (1:5 Â 12 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 7.0), containing 200 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.2 to 1.2 M NaCl in the starting buffer, and the purified protein was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0) buffer, containing 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 , and 200 mM arginine hydrochloride. Arginine hydrochloride was required to solubilize the protein in the buffer. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS­PAGE using 15% polyacrylamide gels. Circular dichroism spectra. CD spectra were measured using a JASCO J 720 spectropolarimeter at given temperatures. PhoAlba was dissolved in 50 mM Tris­ HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.5 M NaCl, and the protein concentration was 0.5 mg/ml. The path length of the cells used for wavelength region 200­250 nm was 1 cm. Thermstability of PhoAlba was evaluated by comparing the CD spectra for the protein treated at given temperatures. Hence, the cuvette containing the protein was heated for 10 min at a given temperature with a thermostatically regulated circulating-water-bath, and then the CD spectra for the proteins were measured as described above. Crystallization and data collection. The purified PhoAlba was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0) buffer, containing 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 , and 200 mM arginine hydrochloride.

Initial screening for crystallization conditions of PhoAlba was performed by the sitting drop method at 20  C by mixing an equal volume of protein (0.8 ml) and reservoir solution (0.8 ml), using crystallization screening kits. The best crystals for x-ray diffraction analysis were obtained within one day under condition of 0.1 M Bicine (pH 9.0) containing PEG MME 550 and 0.1 M NaCl. The crystal was transferred into a cryoprotectant solution (0.1 M Bicine, pH 9.0, containing PEG MME 550, 0.1 M NaCl, and 20% glycerol). X-ray diffraction data were collected using the synchrotron radiation source at station BL40B2 of SPring-8, Japan. The crystal diffracted to ° 2.8 A, belonging to space group P21 21 21 with unit ° ° cell dimensions of a ¼ 41:26 A, b ¼ 51:97 A, and c ¼ ° . The crystal contained two dimers in the 173:00 A asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 44.96% and ° a VM value of 2.23/Da A. All data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000.26) The statistics for data collection are given in Table 1. Structural determination and refinement. The crystal structure of PhoAlba was determined by the molecular replacement method using S. solfataricus Alba (SsoAlba)25) as a search model with program CNS.27) Structure refinement was done using CNS with diffraction data ° from 50.0 to 2.8 A resolution. After the first step of refinement, an atomic model of PhoAlba was rebuilt using the program Coot.28) Iterative cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding in Coot were carried out until the free R-factor converged. The stereochemistry of the models was verified using PROCHECK.29) Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2Z7C.

Functional analyses. The RNA-binding capacity of PhoAlba for PhopRNA and pre-tRNATyr was tested by gel shift assay, as described previously.21,23) The involvement of PhoAlba in pre-tRNA processing activity was analyzed as follows: reconstituted particles R-5P and R-4P, composed of PhopRNA and four and five proteins respectively, were prepared, and then an equimolar amount of PhoAlba was added. The pretRNA processing activity for R-5P and R-4P was analyzed at 55  C and 70  C respectively for the indicated periods of time using in vitro transcribed 32 P-labelled P. horikoshii pre-tRNATyr , as described previously.21,23) The optimum temperature of the reconstituted R-4P and PhoAlba was analyzed as described above, except that the activity was measured at various temperatures. Reaction products were separated on 15% polyacrylamide denaturing gels, and then visualized using a PhosphorImager, FLA-5000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo). For time-course analysis, the resulting phosphorimagery was used to obtain values for the pre-tRNA processing activity with various incubation times. The processing activity was calculated as follows: quantity of (matured tRNA + leader fragment) Â 100/quantity of (pre-tRNA + matured tRNA + leader fragment). The percentage was plotted against the incubation times. Nomenclature. The Alba proteins have been isolated from various archaea and they have distinct names, such as DBNP-B, Sac10b, Sso10b, and Ssh10b.2,3) The new nomenclature, Alba (acetylation lowers binding affinity),6) is used in this paper, and the prefixes Pho, Sso, Afu, and Mja are added to differentiate them from homologous proteins from P. horikoshii, S. solfataricus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, and Methanococcus jannashii respectively.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of PhoAlba We searched the Alba proteins in the P. horikoshii genome database with the program BLAST2 using the Alba protein (SsoAlba) from S. solfataricus as a probe. The search revealed that the gene PHS053 has sequence homology to the gene encoding SsoAlba. Hence the PHS053 gene product was referred to as PhoAlba. The PhoAlba protein consists of 93 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of PhoAlba was aligned with the sequences of five archaeal homologs by CLUSTAL W, as shown in Fig. 1A. In this comparison, PhoAlba shared 63, 66, 52, 32, and 54 amino acid residues with AfuAlba1, AfuAlba2, SsoAlba1, SsoAlba2, and MjaAlba respectively, that is, 70.8%, 74.2%, 56.5%, 36.8%, and 62.1% amino acid sequence identity. PhoAlba was readily aligned with homologous proteins without deletion or insertion. There were identical residues at 14 positions in all sequences, and at a considerable number of the other positions there were chemically

similar residues. Particularly, the N-terminal half was highly conserved, having long runs of absolutely conserved sequences. Aravind et al. classified the human RNase P protein subunits Rpp20 and Rpp25 into the Alba family.10) Figure 1B shows a sequence alignment of the PhoAlba sequence with the sequences of human RNase P proteins Rpp20 and Rpp25. In this comparison, PhoAlba can be aligned with the central regions of Rpp20 and Rpp25 by making a few long deletions in PhoAlba (Fig. 1B). The comparison indicated that PhoAlba shares 23 and 13 identical residues with Rpp20 and Rpp25, that is, at 26.1% and 14.4% of the residues compared, respectively. PhoAlba in P. horikoshii might thus function as a homolog of human Rpp20 and/or Rpp25 in RNase P. To address this issue and also to provide more structural information about euryarchaeal Alba proteins, we attempted to crystallize PhoAlba, and we tested its involvement in catalysis by P. horikoshii RNase P. For this purpose, the gene PHS053 was amplified from genomic DNA from P. horikoshii OT3, and the amplified DNA fragment was placed under the control of the phage promoter on expression plasmid pET-22b. Expression in the E. coli BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus RIL strain, preparation of the lysate, and purification of the resulting protein were done as described in ``Materials and Methods.'' The PhoAlba protein was purified to homogeneity. The yield was about 10 mg/liter in induced cultures. It is known that SsoAlba is an = protein consisting of two -helices and four -strands,25) and that the Pyrococcus proteins are generally thermostable. To evaluate the structural integrity and also to confirm thermostability of the resulting protein, PhoAlba, we measured circular dichroism (CD) spectrum at 37  C in the far-ultraviolet region (200 nm­250 nm), where the spectra reflects the content of the secondary structures of the protein. As shown in Fig. 2, the CD spectrum of PhoAlba showed a bottom peak around 222 nm, mainly from -helical structure in the protein. It was hence suggested that the resulting PhoAlba folds into a native structure containing an -helical structure. Further, thermostability was examined by comparing the CD spectra of the protein treated at various temperatures. Hence, the cuvette containing PhoAlba was heated for 10 min at a given temperature by a thermostatically regulated circulating-water bath, and then the CD spectra were measured at various temperatures. As Fig. 2 shows, the CD spectra of PhoAlba treated at up to 65  C were essentially the same as that of the protein treated at 37  C, and only a slight change was detected in the protein treated at 75  C. This result confirmed the structural integrity and thermostability of PhoAlba prepared in this study. Structural determination It has been reported that PhoAlba proteins might

function as the equivalent of Rpp20 and/or Rpp25 in human RNase P.10) Our previous studies determined crystal structures of the five P. horikoshii RNase P proteins.23,30­33) The amino acid residues in PhoRpp21 and PhoRpp30 essential for the activity were assigned by site-directed mutagenesis.30,32) In the present study, to extend this structural analysis to PhoAlba and also to gain more structural information about euryarchaeal Alba proteins, we determined the crystal structure of PhoAlba. Crystals of PhoAlba were grown from 0.1 M Bicine (pH 9.0), containing PEG MME 550 and 0.1 M NaCl. ° The crystals diffracted to 2.8 A, belonging to the space ° group P21 21 21 , with cell dimensions a ¼ 41:26 A, ° , and c ¼ 173:00 A. The crystals of PhoAl° b ¼ 51:97 A ba contained two dimers (MolA, MolB, MolC, and MolD) per asymmetric unit, corresponding to a VM of ° 2.23 A3 /Da, and the calculated solvent content of the crystal was 44.96%. The statistics of data collection are summarized in Table 1. The crystal structure of PhoAlba was solved by the molecular displacement method using SsoAlba from S. solfataricus as a search model. The two dimers in the asymmetric unit (referred to as A, B, C, and D) had slightly different conformations in the loop regions. After refinement, the model had an Rwork ° of 23.0% for 95% of the data between 50.0 and 2.8 A. The Rfree for the remaining 5% of the data within this resolution range was 31.8%. The refined structure contained 359 residues (5-93, MolA; 5-93, MolB; 593, MolC; and 2-93, MolD) and 86 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. The model had geometries close ° to ideal, with a rmsd of 0.0074 A and 1.30 from ideal values for bond lengths and angles respectively. When the structure was examined using PROCHECK, 83.0% of the non-glycine and non-proline residues fell in the most favored regions and 17.0% in the permitted region of the Ramachandran plot in all molecules. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structural description A stereo view of the overall dimeric structure of PhoAlba is shown in Fig. 3A. The monomer is of the = type, consisting of a four-stranded -sheet and two -helices. The connectivity scheme is 1-1-2-2-34, and the secondary structure of PhoAlba, as defined by the DSSP program, is given in Fig. 1. The N-terminal half consisted of a two-stranded parallel -sheet and two -helices, and the two -strands (1 and 2) were connected to the -helices, 1 and 2 respectively, by sharp turns which have highly conserved glycine residues, Gly10, Gly28, and Gly38, between 1 and 1, 1 and 2, and 2 and 2 respectively. The C-terminal half consisted of a two-stranded antiparallel -sheet, forming an extended -ribbon structure with a natural right-handed twist. The three -strands (2-4) ran antiparallel, whereas 1 ran parallel to the adjoining 2 strand, and the resulting -sheet formed a concave surface on one side of the molecule. The concave shape

of the -sheet was reinforced by the hydrophobic interactions on the back side of the -sheet where -helical segments (1 and 2) packed against the sheet, forming a well-extended hydrophobic cluster. It involved residues Val7, Ile9, Val18, Val21, Phe25, Val32, Ile34, Ala36, Ala40, Ile41, Ala44, Val47, Ala48, Val51, Leu56, Val60, Ile87, and Leu89. The surface representation of the electrostatic potential clearly shows that the concave surface of the molecule is positively charged, including Lys11, Lys35, Arg37, Arg39, Arg43, Arg54, Lys57, and Arg78, whereas the backside is neutral, as shown in Fig. 3B. PhoAlba, like other homologous Alba proteins, occurs as a dimer in solution. Gel filtration analysis revealed that the form of PhoAlba in solution had a molecular weight of about 20 kDa (data not shown), which is consistent with a dimeric form. Two monomers sat back to back to expose their concave surfaces, and the two -ribbon arms extended from the body in opposite directions, adopting a conformation that resembles the letter X, in which the two arms of the X are formed by the two -ribbon structures (Fig. 3A). The two molecules appeared to interact via close contacts primarily involving segments of -helices, 2, and the long extended arm structures. The interface between the homodimer of PhoAlba was extended over a large surface area and was dominated by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 3C). These interactions involved Ile41 and Val45 at 2; Val62, Ile65, and Ile67 at 3; and Ile87 at 4. The side chains of Ile41 and Val45 at 2 in one PhoAlba interacted with those of Ile41 and Val45 in the other PhoAlba, and vice versa. In addition, the side chains of Val62, Ile65, and Ile67 interacted with those of Ile67, Ile65, and Ile62 in the other PhoAlba, and vice versa. Furthermore, a few hydrogen bonding interactions appeared to stabilize the contact face of the two molecules. Hence, the side chains of Asp46 and Glu49 formed hydrogen bonds with those of Ser83, Gly68, and Thr69 in the other PhoAlba and vice versa. Structural comparison In overall structure, PhoAlba displayed significant similarity to archaeal homologs (Fig. 4A). Superposition of the entire PhoAlba with the four homologs SsoAlba1,25) SsoAlba2,34) AfuAlba,35) and MjaAlba36) using the program SSM gave rmsd values of 1.18, 1.10, 0.96, and 0.87 respectively for 87, 82, 85, and 77 C atoms respectively. This result is fully consistent with the taxonomy of archaea: S. solfataricus belongs to crenarchaeota, whereas P. horikoshii, A. fulgidus, and M. jannashii are classified into euryarchaeota. A slightly distinct structure was observed at the tip of the extended -ribbon arm. Slightly different structures were also found by comparison of the four independent molecules of PhoAlba in the asymmetric unit (data not shown). This suggests structural flexibility of the loop between 3 and 4. The tip of the loop between 3 and 4 might

interact with DNA/RNA, as proposed by models, thereby fixing the conformations. Based on the crystal structures of SsoAlba1 and SsoAlba2, models for the Alba proteins bound to both B-DNA and A-DNA (or RNA) have been proposed.25,34) In these models, the two loops between 1 and 1 in the dimer bind to the phosphates across the major groove of DNA or RNA, whereas the two flexible  hairpin arms between 3 and 4 in the dimer extend from the body in the opposite direction oriented to contact the minor groove of DNA or RNA. The loop between 1 and 1 and -hairpin loop between 3 and 4 in PhoAlba are highly conserved with the corresponding structures in other Alba proteins. It is thus likely that PhoAlba binds DNA or RNA in a manner identical to models proposed for SsoAlba1 and SsoAlba2. Furthermore, a Dali server search showed that PhoAlba, like other Alba proteins, is similar to RNAbinding proteins, such as the C-terminal half of initiation factor 3 from Bacillus stearothermophilus (IF3-C)37) (Dali Z score = 7.4) and the E. coli protein implicated in cell division (Yhhp)38) (Dali Z score = 6.5). In addition, PhoAlba was found to have significant similarity to an Arabidopsis protein of unknown function (PDB ID 1vm0), giving a Dali Z score of 10.9. PhoAlba could be superimposed on IF3-C, Yhhp, and ° the Arabidopsis protein, giving rmsd values of 7.4 A for ° ° 70 C atoms, 3.45 A for 100 C atoms, and 1.6 A for 77 C atoms respectively (Fig. 4B). This finding indicates that an ancestral protein for the Alba protein family emerged before the divergence of the three phylogenetic domains of life, and has evolved into the Alba family proteins that might play roles in diverse aspects of DNA/RNA metabolism in all organisms. Involvement of PhoAlba in RNase P activity Although Alba is a dominant chromosomal protein in crenarchaeota, the Alba homologs have not been detected as major constituents of the chromatin of euryarchaeota.9) This finding suggests that the highly conserved Alba homologs in euryarchaeota might have additional functions. Recently, it was reported that the protein subunits Rpp20 and Rpp25 of human ribonuclease P (RNase P) belong to the Alba protein family, suggesting that archaeal Alba proteins are the functional equivalent of Rpp20 and/or Rpp25 in archaeal RNase Ps or related ribonucleoprotein complexes.10) In the foregoing study, we found that the four RNase P proteins (PhoPop5, PhoRpp21, PhoRpp29, and PhoRpp30) bound to both PhopRNA and pre-tRNATyr ,21) while PhoRpp38 bound PhopRNA but not to pre-tRNATyr .23) The affinity of PhoAlba for PhopRNA as well as pretRNATyr was evaluated by gel retardation assay, as described in ``Materials and Methods.'' In this analysis, a basic protein, hen egg white lysozyme, was used as a control. In vitro synthesized PhopRNA and pre-tRNATyr were prepared, and the assay was done with increasing concentrations of PhoAlba. Mobility shift assays re-

Fig. 5. RNA-Binding Activity of PhoAlba. Gel shift assay was done in a reaction mixture containing PhopRNA (A) or pre-tRNATyr (B) and increasing amounts (0-8-fold molar excesses) of PhoAlba in binding buffer, as described in ``Materials and Methods.'' Gel shift assays were done with increasing amounts of hen egg white lysozyme as a control.

vealed that PhoAlba formed complexes with both PhopRNA and pre-tRNATyr , whereas lysozyme showed no significant band shift (Fig. 5). This result indicates that PhoAlba, like other four proteins,21) interacts with PhopRNA and pre-tRNATyr . Next we added PhoAlba to the reconstituted particles (R-4P or R-5P) composed of PhopRNA and four or five proteins respectively, and evaluated its involvement in the catalytic activity of P. horikoshii RNase P. In this analysis, lysozyme was again used as a control protein, because it is known to be a highly thermostable protein, having a midpoint thermal denaturation temperature at 78  C.39) First, R-5P and R-4P were mixed with increasing amounts of PhoAlba, and then the resulting particles were characterized with respect to pre-tRNA processing activity for 20 min at 55  C and at 70  C. As shown in Fig. 6A, increasing amounts of PhoAlba added to R-4P appeared to enhance the activity at 55  C, and a slight enhancement of activity was also observed in reconstituted particles of R-5P analyzed at 55  C and 70  C. However, a similar activation of processing activity was observed with the addition of lysozyme to reconstituted particles R-5P and R-4P (data not shown). Hence, we further analyzed the time-course (0­20 min) of the pre-tRNA processing activities of R-5P and R-4P containing a 4-fold molar excess of PhoAlba. The result showed that the addition of PhoAlba to R-5P increased the processing activity both at 55  C and 70  C. However, lysozyme had a similar effect on the processing activity of the reconstituted particle: it appeared to increase processing activity slightly (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the addition of PhoAlba to R-4P resulted in a small increase in pre-tRNA processing activity at 55  C, while lysozyme had little effect on the activity (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that PhoAlba has little influence on the processing activity of the reconstituted particle lacking PhoRpp38, suggesting that PhoAlba might replace PhoRpp38 in the reconstituted particle. This assumption led to the speculation that PhoAlba might, like PhoRpp38,23) be involved in the elevation of the optimal temperature of the reconstituted particle. To test this assumption, the influence of PhoAlba on

the optimum temperature of the reconstituted particles was evaluated. PhoAlba was added to R-4P and the pretRNA processing activity was measured at various temperatures. As shown in Fig. 7, although the addition of PhoAlba or lysozyme resulted in the particles showing activity at a slightly higher temperature (around 67  C), unlike PhoRpp38, they had no influence on the optimal temperature (around 58  C) of R-4P (Fig. 7). Taken together with these results, it is possible that addition of the protein to reconstituted particles R-5P and R-4P somehow slightly stabilizes a catalytic conformation of PhopRNA, and thereby lightly activates the pre-tRNA processing activity of the reconstituted particles. Hence, we concluded that PhoAlba is unlikely to be directly involved in the pre-tRNA processing activity of P. horikoshii RNase P. Conclusion The Alba superfamily includes the human RNase P protein subunits Rpp20 and Rpp25. It is known that Rpp20 and Rpp25 have chromatin-binding capabilities.40,41) Furthermore, the heterodimerization of Rpp20 and Rpp25 regulates their RNA-binding activity, subcellular localization, and expression.19) A recent study showed that human nuclear RNase P is required for transcription of tRNA and other small noncoding RNA genes by pol III, and Rpp20 and Rpp25 are expected to play an essential role in this function as chromatin-binding proteins.20) In the present study, we found that PhoAlba in the hyperthermophilic archaeon P. horikoshii was capable of binding to PhopRNA and pre-tRNATyr , but that it had little effect on the pre-tRNA processing activity of reconstituted R-5P or R-4P composed of PhopRNA and five or four proteins respectively. Furthermore, PhoAlba had no influence on the optimum temperature of R-4P. PhoAlba is, therefore, unlikely to play an essential role in catalysis by RNase P in P. horikoshii. Rather, PhoAlba might, as is the case for Rpp20 and/or Rpp25 in human RNase P, be involved in transcriptional regulation of tRNA and noncoding RNAs in P. horikoshii. Further studies of PhoAlba will address this intriguing assumption and
