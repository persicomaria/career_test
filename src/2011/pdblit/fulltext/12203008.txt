Abstract The three-dimensional structures of the isolated Cd3b domains from Homarus americanus metallothionein have been determined by NMR methods in order to establish a set of b-domain structures for comparative analysis. First, it was determined that the Cd-cysteine connectivities forming the Cd3S9 metal center were identical to those observed for the bN domain in the native holoprotein. Time- and temperaturedependence studies of the 113Cd and 1H 1D-NMR spectra indicated that the bN domain undergoes slow conformational changes before reaching an equilibrium structure. In addition to structural information provided by the metal-to-cysteine connectivities, F, v1 and v2 angle constraints, three HN...S hydrogen bond interactions were also determined from a long-range optimized 1 N 113 H - Cd HMQC experiment. A simulated annealing protocol was applied to the distance and angle constraints obtained from the 2D-NMR experiments to

calculate the three-dimensional structure of the synthetic Cd3bN domain of lobster metallothionein. Structurereactivity relationships are proposed for the reactions of Cd3b domains with 5,5¢-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), based on comparisons of surface exposure of sulfur atoms of the lobster and rabbit Cd3b domain structures. Finally, the surface exposure of the b domains of lobster is compared with b domains from mammalian metallothioneins.

Introduction
Metallothionein (MT) is a small protein discovered in 1957 by Margoshes and Vallee [1] in the kidney of horses adventitiously exposed to cadmium in the environment. It is characterized by the lack of histidine, aromatic amino acids and disulfide bonds, despite its high content (30%) of cysteine residues. These features confer on MT its well-established, large metal-binding capacity. Among the numerous biological roles attributed to MT are detoxification of heavy metals such as Hg2+ or Cd2+, radical scavenging of reactive oxygen species, metabolism of alkylating agents and other metallodrugs, participation in the stress response and regulation of zinc and copper metabolism including donation of zinc and copper to newly synthesized apoenzymes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. All of these activities are predicated on the metal and ligand substitution properties of the protein as well as the reactivity of its thiol groups [11]. Mammalian metallothioneins have been characterized by X-ray and NMR techniques [12, 13, 14, 15]. Their structure is based on the presence of metal-thiolate clusters which comprise the interior space of the b- or Nterminal and a- or C-terminal domains. The b-domain includes nine cysteine residues and binds three divalent metal ions, while the a-domain contains 11 cysteine

residues which bind four metal ions.1 The mammalian protein practically lacks any elements of secondary structure. The only fragment of secondary structure that has been reported, a 310 helix, is found at the C-terminal end of the sequence [12, 14, 15]. Crustacean MTs differ from the mammalian structure in that they only have 18 cysteine residues within their sequences that give rise to two M3S9 clusters and peptide domains [16, 17, 18]. Previous structural studies carried out with lobster (Homarus americanus) and crab (Callincetes sapidus) Cd6-MT using 2D-NMR methods showed that the Cd-cysteine connectivities and, hence, the peptide folding, differ between their bN and bC clusters and also diverge from that found for the bN domain in mammalian MTs, despite the nearly homologous placement of cysteine residues in the crustacean and mammalian bN domains [17, 18]. These three M3b domains display different reactivity toward reagents such as DTNB [5,5¢-dithio(2-nitrobenzoic acid)] and EDTA, leading to the hypothesis that their reactivity is related to the detailed folding of the peptide sequences around their clusters and not just to properties of the clusters themselves [19, 20]. Structural studies of the chemically synthesized lobster bN and bC domains have been carried out as part of a systematic investigation of the structural basis for the differences in reactivity among various b-domain structures. In this work the 3D structure of the chemically synthesized Cd3bN and Cd3bC domains of lobster metallothionein have been determined using 2D-NMR spectroscopy. These results provide the opportunity to consider structure-reactivity relations among Cd3bN domains.

previously described [20]. For the NMR experiments, a 3­5 mM sample was used in 5 mM Tris-d11-HCl, pH 7.4 (90% H2O/10% D2O) for Cd3bN. In the case of Cd3bC, a 2­3 mM sample in 5 mM Tris-d11-HCl, pH 7.4, in both 90% H2O/10% D2O and in 100% D2O was used. NMR methods One-dimensional 113Cd{1H} NMR spectra were obtained at several temperatures (278, 298 and 333 K) using a Bruker DPX300 NMR spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient broadband probe. The 113 Cd chemical shifts are reported with respect to the external standard 0.1 M 113Cd(ClO4)2 as 0.0 ppm. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker DRX500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a three-axis gradient inverse probe. PE-COSY, TOCSY and NOESY experiments were performed using the standard pulse sequences with water suppression achieved using the WATERGATE scheme [21] combined with water flip-back pulses employing low-power rectangular pulses (90° pulse of 2 ms). DQF-COSY, 1H{113Cd} HSQC and 113 Cd HSQC TOCSY experiments were obtained with gradient selection for coherence selection and water suppression [22]. TOCSY experiments employed a DIPSI-2 spin lock of 90 ms and NOESY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 60 and 150 ms in the case of Cd3bN and 100, 200 and 300 ms in the case of Cd3bC. 113Cd decoupling was applied in most experiments except for the COSY experiments used to measure 3JHbCd. Hydrogen bond-mediated amide proton 1H-113Cd coupling constants 2hJHNCd were measured using the 1D heteronuclear spinecho difference method (HSED) modified by an additional water flipback pulse and pulse field gradients for water suppression [23, 24]. The delay for HN-Cd magnetization transfer was 62 ms and the delay (D) separating the two jump and return 90° pulses for decoupling of JHNa and water suppression was set to 208 ls (1/[2(dHN­dH2O)]). A 90x° (113Cd) pulse at the beginning of data acquisition ensured a purely absorptive character of the signals from protons coupled to 113 Cd. Ten thousand transients were accumulated in the difference spectrum, whereas the reference spectrum was acquired with 100 scans. Hydrogen bond connectivities were obtained from a 2D 1H{113Cd} HMQC experiment optimized for small HN-Cd couplings by decoupling 3JNHa during the indirect detection period in a similar fashion as in the 1D HSED experiment (see Fig. S1 of the Supplementary material). For the 2D data set, 1024 transients were accumulated for each of the 18 complex data points. Distance and dihedral angle restraints In the case of the bN domain, cross-peaks in the 60 ms NOESY spectrum at 278 K were classified as strong, medium, or weak and ° were assigned distance restraints of 1.8­2.7, 1.8­3.6 and 1.8­4.5 A, respectively. Additional cross-peaks observed in the 150 ms mixing ° time spectrum were assigned distance limits of 1.8­5.8 A. The bC domain cross-peaks in the 100 ms spectrum at 298 K were classi° fied according to their peak intensity, with upper bounds of 2.7 A ° ° (strong), 3.2 A (medium) and 3.6 A (weak), respectively. Additional cross-peaks observed in the spectra acquired with mixing times of 200 ms and 300 ms were assigned upper bounds of ° ° 4.5 A and 5.5 A, respectively. In the case of restraints involving ° methyl groups, 0.5 A were added as correction to the upper bounds. In addition, for those amide protons exhibiting a crosspeak in the long-range optimized 1H-113Cd HMQC spectrum, ° ° NHÆÆÆS hydrogen bonds of 2.7­3.0 A and 3.6­3.9 A for the HN-S and N-S distances, respectively, were included as ambiguous restraints to the four Sc atoms connected to the particular Cd. Restraints for some backbone dihedral angles u were obtained from 3JHNa coupling constants and set as follows, ­120±30° (for 3 JHNa>10 Hz), ­120±40° (for 10 Hz>3JHNa>8.5 Hz) and ­60±30° (for 3JHNa<5 Hz). Side-chain v1 angles could be constrained for those residues for which stereospecific assignment of the b-methylene protons was possible [25]. In addition, restraints for some of the CaCbScCd v2 torsional angles of non-bridging cysteines were obtained from 3JHbCd coupling constants using the

Material and methods
Peptide synthesis, purification and analysis Fmoc-amino acids, Fmoc-alanine-Sasrin resin, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and N,N¢-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide were purchased from Bachem. Dichloromethane, N-methylpyrrolidone, acetonitrile, trifluoroacetic acid, ammonium sulfate, diethyl ether (anhydrous), CdCl2, sodium acetate, HCl, NaOH and KCl were obtained from EM-Science; Trizma base, ninhydrin, trimethylsilyl bromide and mcresol were from Sigma; thioanisole was from Janssen Chimica; DTNB and ammonium bicarbonate were from Aldrich; 1,2-ethanedithiol was from Merck Shuchardt; and Tris-d11, NaOD and DCl were from Isotech. The Cd3bN and Cd3bC domains of lobster metallothionein (MT-1) were synthesized and then purified and characterized as

The sequences of the lobster (crab) bN and bC domains of MT-1 and the rabbit MT-2 bN domain are given in Table S1 of the Supplementary material. The Cd-cysteine thiolate connectivities for the lobster and crab domains are identical: Cd3bN-CdII (Cys5,9,22,25), -CdIII(Cys4,5,16,20), -CdV(Cys11,16,25,27); Cd3bCCdI(Cys39,45,49,56), -CdIV(Cys33,37,55,56); and CdVI(Cys30,33, 49,53). Those for rabbit MT-2 Cd3bN are CdIV(Cys5,7,21,24), CdIII(Cys7,13,15,26), CdII(Cys15,19,24,29). It is noted that the chemical shifts of CdII and CdIII in the lobster holoprotein and in the bN domain are reversed; thus, the numbering of CdII and CdIII also switches

715 Karplus-type relation reported by Zerbe et al. [26]. Metal cluster connectivities were determined from the 1H{113Cd} HSQC-TOCSY experiment and introduced as restraints by defining the appropriate cluster element in X-PLOR, assuming tetrahedral geometry about the Cd and using average values obtained from the metal-thiolate ° model complexes for the Cd-S bond length (2.54 A) and S-Cd-S, CS-Cd and Cb-S-Cd angles [27]. For the bonds and angles involving ° ° Cd, force constants of 500 kcal mol­1 A­2 and 250 kcal mol­1 A­2 were used, respectively. Structure calculation Structure calculations were carried out with the program X-PLOR 3.851. The ab initio simulated annealing protocol [28, 29] was used to generate 300 structures, starting from a linear chain with randomized u and w angles and metal ion coordinates. The protocol involved a 30 ps high-temperature phase at 2000 K that is followed by two cooling phases, the first one of 10 ps during which the temperature was lowered to 1000 K in steps of 50 K, and a second of 6 ps that reached a final temperature of 100 K. Distance restraints from experimental NOEs were applied with a soft square potential and a force constant which was gradually increased to ° 50 kcal mol­1 A­2 during the high-temperature phase. Restraints involving methylene protons which were not stereospecifically assigned were treated with the floating chirality procedure of XPLOR [30]. Dihedral restraints were applied with a force constant of 200 kcal mol­1 rad­2. The best structures (91 bN, 63 bC) were further refined using a lower initial annealing temperature of 600 K and a 5 ps cooling phase. Analysis of structures Secondary structure determination and calculation of the solvent exposure of sulfur atoms were carried out with the program MOLMOL [31]. Ramachandran plots were obtained using the program PROCHECK [32]. Molecular dynamics calculations were performed as described previously [20].

which strongly supports the lack of elements of secondary structure (Fig. 1). A total of 240 proton distances were assigned from NOESY spectra at 278 K for the synthetic lobster Cd3bN. Figure 1 summarizes those NOEs corresponding to the sequential and mediumrange interactions. The sequential NOE pattern was consistent with the presence of three possible b-turns centered at Cys5, Gly14 and Cys22, based on the presence of strong HN-HN(i­1,i) and HN-Ha(i,i+1) peaks and the presence of an HN-HN(i­1,i+1) cross-peak. Side-chain v1 torsional angles fall within the same range as those observed for the native crab holoprotein [18]. The temperature coefficients of the amide proton chemical shifts are summarized in Fig. 1. The amide protons of Cys16, Thr18, Gly19, Lys21 and Arg26 exhibited the most strongly negative temperature coefficients (<­9.5 ppb K­1), which suggested that these amide NH groups are exposed to the solvent. Notably, all residues in the loop comprised of residues 16­19 exhibited large temperature-dependent shifts, indicative of increased flexibility of this loop. Structure calculation For the structure calculation in X-PLOR 3.851 [28, 29], a total of 240 NOEs (89 intra-residual, 94 sequential, 39 medium range and 18 long range) and three HNÆÆÆS hydrogen bonds were included, along with a total of 27 dihedral angle restraints (13 F, 10 v1 and four Cys-Cd v2 angles) from 3JHNa, 3Jab and 3JbCd. With this information and the procedure outlined in the experimental section, a final set of 63 low-energy structures was ob° tained with no NOE violations greater than 0.4 A and with no deviations from the ideal geometry for the ° peptide bonds and angles of more than 0.05 A and 5°, respectively. However, there was always one dihedral violation larger than 5° for the dihedral angle v1 of Cys27. As found in similar structures [18], the metal cluster (Cd3S9) exhibited deviations from ideal tetrahedral geometry that were larger than 5° for the cadmium center, but none of them was greater than 10°. A superposition of 30 of these structures is shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 summarizes the results of the structure calculation. The set of structures exhibited low (0.36) RMSD values for the Cd-S cluster and the non-terminal backbone atoms. Generally, the backbone torsional angles were in the allowed space of the Ramachandran plot (38% core, 48% allowed and 9% generously allowed regions); only Lys8 was located in the disallowed region according to the PROCHECK program [32]. As expected, larger variations were observed for residues at the ends of the polypeptide chain. The loop comprising residues Glu16 to Gly19 exhibited some disorder consistent with the high temperature coefficients of the amide proton chemical shifts for those residues and consistent with increased flexibility in this region compared to the rest of the backbone (Fig. 2). The structure lacks any elements of secondary structure, although

Results
Cd3bN structure NMR assignments of the final structure Chemical shift assignments of backbone and side-chain protons of the final equilibrium structure of Cd3bN were obtained according to standard procedures (Supplementary material, Table S2A) [25, 33, 34]. It was necessary to acquire TOCSY spectra at different temperatures to observe broadened resonances and to resolve chemical assignment ambiguities [18, 25, 33, 34]. Cadmium-cysteine connectivities were obtained from the 1H{113Cd} HSQC-TOCSY experiment (Supplementary material, Fig. S2). They showed that the synthetic Cd3bN exhibits the same metal coordination as the native holoprotein [17]. It should be noted, however, that the chemical shift order of CdII and CdIII is interchanged with respect to the holoprotein. Secondary structure analysis Analysis of 3JHNa from the phase-sensitive COSY revealed values varying randomly from 5.3 to 11.2 Hz,

analysis of the u angles in the final structure indicated the possible presence of several b2-type turns centered at Cys5, Cys11 and Gly14.

Hydrogen-bonding interactions The temperature dependence of the amide proton chemical shift provides an indirect indication of possible hydrogen bonds involving amide hydrogens with a low temperature coefficient (Dd>­5 ppb K­1) (Fig. 1) [35]. Scalar spin-spin couplings, 2hJHCd (NHÆÆÆS-Cd), typically on the order of 0.5­2.0 Hz, offer more direct evidence of HNÆÆS hydrogen bonding [23]. A two-dimensional 1 H{113Cd} HMQC experiment optimized for small couplings, and with decoupling of 3JHNa during the indirect detection period, was employed to obtain qualitative connectivity information between amide protons and the 113Cd2+ ions (Fig. 3). The strongest of the observed signals corresponded to a cross-peak between the amide proton of Glu10 and CdIII. Since CdIII is coordinated to Cys4, Cys5, Cys16 and Cys20, all of which

are at least five residues distant from Glu10, long-range coupling was not possible. Therefore, the cross-peak was attributed to a hydrogen bond between the amide proton of Glu10 and a sulfur atom of one of the cysteines coordinated to CdIII. The NMR structure for Cd3bN showed that, of these four, only the thiolate (Sc) of Cys5 was within distance to form a NHÆÆÆS hydrogen bond. Since Sc of Cys5 is bridging two Cd2+, the hydrogen bond to the amide proton of Glu10 might give rise to a NH/Cd cross peak not only with CdIII but also with CdII. However, only the former was observed. The CdIII-S-HN angle across the hydrogen bond of the final 63 ensemble structures was 113­115° for all observed NH/Cd interactions. In contrast, the CdII-S-HN angle was much smaller (78°), suggesting the possibility of an angle dependence of the NHÆÆÆCd coupling similar to that proposed for 2hJHP and 3hJNP couplings through NHÆÆÆO-P hydrogen bonds [36]. Three other hydrogen bonds, Ser24(NH)ÆÆ Cys22 (Sc), Cys22(NH)ÆÆÆCys20(Sc) and Cys5(NH)ÆÆÆCys5(Sc), were also identified by a coupling of the amide protons with CdII, CdIII and CdII, respectively (Table 2). In the case of the intra-residue interaction Cys5(NH)ÆÆÆ Cys5(Sc), a long-range coupling over five bonds could not be completely ruled out and thus this hydrogen bond was not used as restraint in the structure calculation. The remaining peak in Fig. 3 appeared to result from a hydrogen bond within the minor conformation, since it was observed in conjunction with a 113Cd signal observed at 639 ppm. In summary, all experimentally determined hydrogen bond interactions were consistent with the observed indirect indicators of hydrogen bonds, namely a downfield chemical shift and a

small negative or positive value of the temperature coefficient of the amide proton chemical shift (> ­5 ppb K­1). A quantitative analysis of 2hJHN-Cd coupling constants mediated via hydrogen bonds to the sulfur atoms of the cysteine residues coordinated to cadmium was carried out using a 1D heteronuclear spin-echo difference experiment [24]. The values obtained for 2hJHN-Cd coupling constants fall in the range 0.3­1.1 Hz (Table 2). These values are of similar magnitude to ones reported previously for rubredoxin and desulfodextrin

[23, 24, 37]. A comparison of the coupling constants with the corresponding NHÆÆÆS distances indicates that there is no direct correlation between the magnitude of 2h JHN-Cd and NHÆÆÆS bond length. Time-dependent formation of native

Cd3bN

The 113Cd chemical shifts (dCd) values of two of the Cd2+ ions, CdII and CdV, obtained immediately after constitution of the Cd3bN did not coincide with the ones observed for the bN domain of the holoprotein, indicating slightly different environments for the two structures. These chemical shifts showed a very slow time dependence and stabilized approximately three months after reconstitution of the apo-domain with Cd2+, with final chemical shifts in good agreement with those of the holoprotein (Fig. 4). Notably, the resonance (dCd) at 646.6 ppm, corresponding to the chemical shift of CdIII in the domain (CdII in the holoprotein), remained constant during this time interval. An additional small signal observed at 639 ppm gradually appeared during the incubation period and apparently represented a minor conformation (10%) about one of the Cd ions. The process was rapidly reversible upon acidification of the protein at equilibrium to pH 2 to dissociate the Cd2+ ions and restoration to pH 7.5 to restore Cd-thiolate bond formation. The 113Cd chemical shifts of this reconstituted sample were in good agreement with the original values of the sample at the beginning of its three months incubation. During this period the mass and the

Cd2+ and reduced thiol concentrations of the sample were repeatedly checked and remained invariant at the values for the native Cd3bN domain. A comparison of TOCSY spectra of the starting and final structures showed that the resonances of the cysteines bound to CdIII remained unaltered, while those of Cys22, Cys25 and Cys11, bound to CdII and CdV, exhibited time-dependent chemical shifts of about 0.1 ppm. Differences were also observed in the resonances of those residues involved in H-bonding in the final, stable structure (residues Cys19, Cys22, Cys24, Cys25). Apparently, only a small part of the structure was changing over time. The nature of this subtle transformation is under investigation. NMR assignments for Cd3bC NMR assignments for the Cd3bC domain were obtained as described for the Cd3bN structure (Supplementary material, Table S2B). In order to establish the connectivity of the Cys residues with the Cd atoms and, thereby, obtain the topology of the Cd-S cluster, a 1 H{113Cd} HSQC-TOCSY experiment was performed. This experiment correlates the 113Cd chemical shift not only with the b-hydrogens of each Cys residue bound to that particular Cd, but also through the TOCSY transfer with all hydrogen atoms of that cysteine, including the amide proton. The advantage of this experiment is that the large chemical shift dispersion of the amide protons permits their unambiguous identification and avoids the problems of assigning overlapping b-proton resonances.

This is demonstrated in Fig. 5, which shows that all terminal and bridging cysteine residues are readily identified from the amide region of the spectrum. It was found that the metal-cluster connectivities are the same as in the bC domain of the holoprotein. Secondary structure analysis A total of 228 proton distances were assigned from NOESY spectra at 298 K for the synthetic lobster Cd3bC. Figure 1 summarizes those corresponding to the sequential and medium-range interactions. Initial analysis of the 3JHNa information from the phase-sensitive COSY revealed values varying randomly from 5.5 to

10.4 Hz, which indicated the absence of any element of regular secondary structure (Fig. 1). Amide protons from residues Glu31, Thr34, Cys37, Ser41, Glu44 and Cys56 exhibited slow proton exchange with water according to the COSY experiment in D2O. One of these slow exchanging amide protons has a NOE signature indicative of a type II b-turn, centered at Leu38 as derived from the presence of strong HN-HN(i­1,i) and HNHa(i,i+1) peaks and the presence of an HN-HN(i­1,i+1) cross-peak. As described for Cd3bN, two HNÆÆÆSc hydrogen bonds were observed, (K32)HNÆÆÆSc(C30) and (C39)HNÆÆÆSc(C37). Table S3 in the Supplementary material summarizes the v1 values calculated for the cysteine residues from the combined analysis of the experimental 3Jab measured in the phase-sensitive COSY spectrum and the intra-residue HN-Hb and Ha-Hb NOE values, as well as the chemical shifts (d) for each of the protons involved in the determination of these torsion angle constraints. These values fall within the same range as those observed for the holoprotein, MT-1, from crab [18]. Structure calculation For the structure calculation, 228 NOEs were applied (101 intra-residue, 78 sequential, 34 medium range and 15 long range). In addition, a total of 20 dihedral angle restraints (11 F, seven v1 and two Cys-Cd v2 angles) from 3JHNHa, 3JHaHb and 3JHbCd were applied. Following the procedure outlined in Material and methods, a final set of 53 lowest energy structures were generated ° which displayed no NOE violations greater than 0.3 A,

no dihedral violations larger than 5°, and exhibited acceptable geometries around the cadmium ions. A superposition of the 30 structures with the lowest energy is shown in Fig. 2. The polypeptide chain folded with the positioning of all the cysteine residues with a lower sequence number on one side of the cadmium plane and those with a higher number on the opposite side. Table 1 summarizes the results of the structure calculations for the synthetic Cd3bC domain of lobster MT. The set of structures exhibited low RMSD values (0.47) for the CdS cluster and the non-terminal backbone atoms. All the backbone torsional angles were in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (29% core, 54% allowed and 17% generously allowed regions), although a larger variation was observed for those residues at the two ends of the polypeptide chain, as expected. Examination of the structures revealed a 310 helix between residues 31 and 33 and a b-helix involving residues 44­48 as the only elements of secondary structure of the synthetic 113 Cd3bC (Fig. 6).

Discussion
NMR and X-ray studies of metallothioneins have shown that the protein is largely devoid of elements of secondary structure [12, 14, 38, 39]. In the determination of the NMR structures, the most important tertiary structural information was the set of Cd-S connectivities. In this study, these were derived from the HSQC-TOCSY spectrum. This is the first example in which cadmium atoms were correlated to the amide protons of the cysteine ligands through TOCSY transfer instead of to the

cysteine b-protons to define the Cd-S connectivities (Fig. 5). Since the amide portion of the spectrum is better resolved than the b-proton region, the specific cadmium-cysteine connectivities were readily identified. The quality of the ensemble of structures used to generate the average domain structures can be judged from (1) the insignificant deviation from the idealized covalent tetrahedral geometry observed for each of the metal centers and (2) the small RMSD values obtained for the ensemble structures (Table 1). It is recognized that the Cd-thiolate core and the backbone surrounding it are the most constrained parts of the structure; much less experimental NMR information was available about the conformation of the side chains. As with the crab Cd3bN and -bC structures in the Cd6-MT holoprotein, both lobster b-domain structures are much better defined than the rabbit Cd3bN domain Cd7-MT. Indeed, considering both the amide proton and 113Cd 1D spectra, each becomes progressively broader in the series Cd3bC (crustacean), Cd3bN (crustacean), Cd3bN (rabbit) [13, 20]. Accordingly, the structures of crustacean Cterminal or Cd3bC domains appear less flexible or participate in fewer exchange processes than their Cd3bN counterparts and the mammalian Cd3bN structure. In particular, the amide region of the proton spectrum is much more resolved in the case of the bC domain; with bN the resolved resonances appear on top of a very broad signal [20]. Similarly, the Cd3bN domains of rabbit MT-2 and human MT-3 displayed broadened resonances [13, 40]. In this respect the bC domain resembles the Cd4a (C-terminal domain) structure of MT2 and human MT-3, which also exhibits well-resolved amide proton spectra (Ejnik J, Munoz A, DeRose EF, ~ Petering DH, in preparation, [41]). Examination of the two lobster domain structures reveals that each metal cluster exhibits a boat conformation, as is found in other b-domains of MTs (Fig. 6). The structure of the synthetic isolated bN domain of lobster MT lacks any element of the secondary structure,

The different stages represent a the naked Cd3S9 cluster; b, d, f the Cd3S9 cluster plus Cys residues and backbone atoms; c, e, g inclusion of all atoms. The residue number of exposed sulfur atoms is indicated. Virtually all sulfur atom coverage is already achieved by cysteine and backbone atoms alone

but the Cd3bC conformation includes a short 310 helix between residues 31­33 and an a-helical segment between residues 45­48 bounded by two cysteine residues, Cys45 and Cys49 (Fig. 6). An a-helix has been found in the C-terminal domain of all the mammalian proteins studied, as well as in the C-terminal b-domain of crab MT. The a-helix of crab MT comprises three more residues, 42­44, than are present in the lobster bC helix. In this work, six possible hydrogen bonds were identified within the Cd3bC domain (Table 2). These ° included HNCys56-OCys53 (2.20 A), which was supported by the observation of slowly exchanging amide protons. ° Others included HNCys49-OCys45 (1.63 A) in the region corresponding to the helix and additional ones involving ° ° HNLys51-OCys49 (1.81 A), HNCys53-OLys51 (2.09 A), ° ° HNSer35-OCys33 (1.82 A) and HNThr58-OCys56 (1.72 A). In addition, analysis of the final ensemble of simulated annealing structures of Cd3bN revealed the presence of two HNÆÆÆO hydrogen bonds in the folded bN domain, namely (G19) HN-Oc (T18) and (C27) HN-O (C25). X-ray diffraction analysis of rat Cd5Zn2-MT has shown that there are 13 potential NHÆÆÆSc hydrogen bonds, eight of which involve residues of the N-terminal

(b) domain and that all but one have a peptide amide NH as the donor [14]. Three NHÆÆÆSc hydrogen bonds were experimentally established for Cd3bN by applying a 2D 1H-{113Cd} HMQC experiment optimized for small HN-Cd couplings (Fig. 4) and two for Cd3bC. This produced the first example of a 2D NH-Cd correlation through a hydrogen bond and the first example of an experimentally established hydrogen bond for a MT in solution. Two of these HNÆÆÆS hydrogen bonds represent a CysXCys motif in which the HN of the second Cys is a hydrogen-bond donor (C22 in Cd3bN and C39 in Cd3bC). Two other hydrogen bonds stabilize a CysXXCys motif by donation of the HN of X(i+2) (S24 in bN and K32 in bC), and one a CysXXXCys motif through a donation from X(i+1) (E10 in bN) (Fig. 6). One of these HNÆÆÆS hydrogen bonds was linked to the Cys5 sulfur atom with Glu10 NH. Another hydrogen bond involving these two residues was inferred from a comparison of chemical shifts of the Cys5 and Glu10 amide protons with the analogous NH groups in the crab protein from Cys5 and Val10. Whereas most NH chemical shifts are identical within 0.2 ppm for both domains, difference chemical shifts of 1.4 ppm for the NH of Cys5 and 0.7 ppm for that of residue 10 were observed (Supplementary material, Fig. S3). It was hypothesized that the substitution of Glu for Val at position 10 affected the chemical shifts of each NH through the formation of a NHÆÆÆO hydrogen bond involving the carboxylate side chain of Glu10. In support of this interpretation, the backbone F angle of lobster Cys5 is positive (+40.3°) and involved in a b2-type turn, whereas it is negative (­87.9°) in crab Cd6-MT, indicative of the presence of different constraining interactions in the two structures. Although the position of the side chain of Glu10 is rather ill-defined in the NMR structure, the N-H bond of Cys5 is oriented in the general direction of the Glu10 residue. Thus, it appears conceivable that a hydrogen bond between these two atoms does form and is responsible for the change of the local geometry of Cys5. The plausibility of this hydrogen bond is supported by molecular dynamics calculations carried out on crab Cd3bN using Sybyl 6. It demonstrated that, in the absence of constraints from the hydrogen bonds, native and mutant Val10Glu structures adopted the same overall peptide conformation. In addition, the mutant displayed a hydrogen bond between amide proton of Cys5 and O of Glu10, as in the lobster domain. In another calculation performed previously [20], the lobster sequence was modified with a Glu10Lys change. In the new structure, the F angle of Cys5 shifted from +40° to ­128.8°, qualitatively approaching the angle in the crab protein, ­87.9°, suggesting that Glu10 is critical to the observed F angle of Cys5. The structures of eight Cd3b domains [the lobster domains, the corresponding b domains of crab MT which have the same Cd-thiolate connectivities, and the structures of several mammalian Cd3bN (rabbit, mouse, rat and human)] have been solved by NMR methods [12,

18, 39, 42]. Exhibiting three different sets of Cd-thiolate connectivities, they serve as a database for inquiry about structure-reactivity relationships of MT domains. As a starting point, reactivity of the Cd3S9 metal-thiolate cluster is hypothesized to depend on the folding of the peptide about the core and to the solvent accessibility of the sulfur atoms of the cluster. The lobster bN structure contains a crevice that ° exposes Cys11 (10.5 A2 sulfur exposure) and Cys27 ° ° (20.9 A2) to solvent (Fig. 7 and Table 3). Cys9 (12.0 A2) also displays significant surface exposure. The four thiolate atoms bound to CdIII are virtually buried, with ° ° ° residual exposure of 0.0 A2 (Cys4), 0.0 A2 (Cys5), 0.0 A2 ° 2 (Cys20). Steric contributions from (Cys16) and 1.3 A the cysteine side-chain methylene and backbone atoms [-CH(NH-)CO-] almost completely block three of these four thiolate groups, leaving the following exposures:

° ° ° 11.4 A2 (Cys4), 2.5 A2 (Cys5), 0.4 A2 (Cys16) and ° 2 (Cys20). Cys25 (0.0 A2) lacks access to solvent ° 1.3 A even in Cd3Cys9. In contrast, the other four sulfurs re° tain 61.7 A2 of surface area in this partial structure. Addition of the rest of the backbone and other amino acid side-chains only reduces their exposure to solvent ° by 45 A2. Table 3 shows a detailed analysis of the solvent exposure of the sulfur atoms for the Cd3bC domain. The Cd3S9 core of the lobster bC domain is almost completely buried by the surrounding peptide. In contrast to other characterized bN and b domains, it does not contain a crevice with multiple, exposed sulfur atoms that serve as a plausible site of solvent interaction with the interior Cd-thiolate cluster (Fig. 7). Instead, only Cys39 and Cys45 display significant solvent access (Table 3).

723

Table 4 lists the solvent-accessible surface area of the sulfur atoms of the lobster, crab and rabbit b-domain structures, revealing a wide range that extends from 15 ° to 74 A2. In order to understand the origin of these differences, Table 4 also contains comparative information about this parameter in the naked Cd3S9 cores, in Cd3Cys9 structures, in Cd3Cys9 plus the rest of the peptide backbone, and in the minimal assemblies of Cd3Cys9 plus the backbone and amino acid side-chains that match the solvent access of the thiolates of the holo b-domains (Fig. 7). Each Cd3S9 core has a similar total ° surface area of 511­544 A2, with the terminal sulfur atoms substantially more exposed than the bridging thiolates. Including the rest of their cysteinyl residues [CH2-CH(NH)-CO], the residual surface area is reduced ° about 80% to 96­108 A2 among the structures. Significant differences emerged when the rest of the backbone without side-chain groups was added to this ensemble. The exposed area of the sulfurs in the three bN domains ° ranged from 69 to 96 A2 in comparison with 42 and ° 2 surfaces in the bC domains. Coverage of the 59 A central cluster by the backbone clearly correlated with the final extent of burial of the sulfur ligands in the holodomain structures. The remaining reduction in sulfur exposure was accomplished by a number of residues in each sequence, with only 2­3 side chains in each sequence individually ° providing more than 3 A2 reduction in surface area (Table 4). In each domain, except lobster and rabbit bN, the contribution of side-chain groups to covering the S atoms was much less than that of the backbone fold surrounding the Cd-cysteine core. In the latter cases, the much smaller coverage of the sulfur atoms by the backbone ensures that the clusters are more open to solvent. Thus, the final solvent accessibility of the sulfur atoms is a clear function of the peptide fold. The validity of this conclusion is strengthened by the recognition that the conformation of the backbone is comparatively well defined by the experimental NMR distance constraints. Among the five sequences, the composition of noncysteine amino acids is diverse. Whereas the rabbit domain involves four charged residues, seven non-polar R groups including the hydrogens of glycines, and five side chains larger than two carbons in length, the lobster domains contain eight charged, eight (bN) or six (bC) nonpolar, and nine (bN) or 11 (bC) large R groups (Supplementary material, Table S1). Similarly, the crab MT-1 domains include seven (bN) or eight (bC) charged side chains, four (bN) or eight (bC) non-polar groups, and nine (bN) or ten (bC) large residues. These sets of side chains ° contribute only 17­42 A2 to the burial of the sulfur atoms. Thus, neither the average steric bulk of the side chains nor their non-polar character or specific charge-charge interactions, such as neutralization of the ­3 charge on the Cd3S9 core by lysines or arginine, seems to play the primary role in the overall coverage of sulfur atoms. Consequently, for most of the structures, the solvent accessibility of the sulfur atoms is only secondarily dependent on the nature of the non-cysteine amino acids.

Table S4 of the Supplementary material summarizes cysteine sulfur accessibility to solvent among four Cd3bN domains of mammalian species, which differ only in the identity of some non-cysteine amino acids in the se° quence. All display total sulfur exposures of 74­88 A2. Thus, the general pattern emerges that different backbone folds are associated with distinct, aggregate solvent accessibilities of the sulfur atoms. The table also reveals that the distribution of exposed surface area among individual sulfur atoms differs among the sequences, showing that more detailed comparisons will be needed to understand the relationship between cluster Cd-thiolate connectivities, backbone fold and cluster exposure to the solvent. The availability of different Cd3b domain structures for which kinetic information on cluster reactivity is in hand offers the opportunity to begin considering structure-reactivity relationships. Examining the thiol-disulfide exchange reactions of DTNB with Cd3bN and Cd3bC of lobster MT, the thiolate groups of each domain react in a biphasic manner with DTNB [20]. Furthermore, each phase displays the rate law k=k1+k2[DTNB]. That is, there is a unimolecular process in each step that is rate limited by the protein as well as a bimolecular component that is determined by interaction between the protein and the thiol reagent. As a starting point for linking structure and reactivity, it is hypothesized that, in the bimolecular reaction, DTNB reacts with thiolates that display solvent accessibility. The biphasic character of each reaction is plausible in terms of the presence of buried Cd-thiolate sites in the clusters. Thus, with Cd3bN, six of the nine thiolate groups bound to two Cd ions react faster than the other three. On the basis of the analysis of the surface exposure of various thiolate groups, those of Cys9 bound to CdII and Cys9 and Cys27 linked with CdV are highly exposed and available for bimolecular reaction with DTNB. The less-reactive Cd center is CdIII, which is effectively buried and without access to DTNB (Table 3). This is also the Cd ion which did not change its chemical shift with time after constitution of the apodomain with Cd2+. Similarly, Cd3bC offers significant sulfur exposure through only two thiolates (Cys39, Cys45) bound to a single metal ion, CdI. Therefore, as experimentally found, it is reasonable that only three thiol groups bound to this Cd ion react in the fast step of the reaction of this domain with DTNB. The rate constants for the second-order components of the reaction of Cd3bC with DTNB are several times larger than those for the reaction involving Cd3bN [20]. Since the cluster of Cd3bC displays only 40% of the sulfur exposure as Cd3bN, the larger second-order rate constants of the bC domain are not explained on the basis of solvent accessibility of the sites of reaction to DTNB. Extension of the structure-reactivity comparison to Cd3bN of rabbit is premature because the rabbit domain structure, obtained by NMR methods at millimolar concentrations of Cd7-MT, exists as a dimer, which may display different reactivity than the monomer [42, 43, 44].

724

A remarkable feature of the reaction of Cd2+ with bN was the initial formation of a Cd3S9 structure that differed in the chemical shift of two of the bound 113Cd ions (CdII and CdV) from those displayed by 113Cd6MT-2 and the equilibrium state of Cd3bN (Fig. 4). The approach to equilibrium was slow, reversible, and not subject to perturbation by temperature. Resonances of residues in the immediate region of CdII were also perturbed, suggestive of an altered cluster conformation. Since apoMT reconstituted with Cd2+ rapidly assumed its equilibrium conformation, these results suggest that interdomain interactions may play a role in the adoption of this structure which are not available to facilitate the formation of the same conformation in the isolated Cd3bN domain. The fact that only two of the three cadmiums participated in the process indicates that at some level the Cd3S9 cluster is not a unit and can be subdivided into two substructures involving two and one Cd ions.
