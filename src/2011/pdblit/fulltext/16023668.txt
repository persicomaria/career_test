Aquifex aeolicus 3-deoxy-D -manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) catalyzes the condensation of arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by favoring the activation of a water molecule coordinated to the active-site metal ion. Cys11, His185, Glu222 and Asp233 are the other metal ligands. Wild-type KDO8PS is purified with Zn2þ or Fe2þ in the active site, but maximal activity in vitro is achieved when the endogenous metal is replaced with Cd2þ. The H185G enzyme retains 8% of the wild-type activity. ICP mass spectrometry analysis indicates that loss of His185 decreases the enzyme affinity for Fe2þ, but not for Zn2þ. However, maximal activity is again achieved by substitution of the endogenous metal with Cd2þ. We have determined the X-ray structures of the Cd2þ H185G enzyme in its substrate-free form, and in complex with PEP, and PEP plus A5P. These structures show a normal amount of Cd2þ bound, suggesting that coordination by His185 is not essential to retain Cd2þ in the active site. Nonetheless, there are significant changes in the coordination sphere of Cd2þ with respect to the wildtype enzyme, as the carboxylate moiety of PEP binds directly to the metal ion and replaces water and His185 as ligands. These observations indicate that the primary function of His185 in A. aeolicus KDO8PS is to orient PEP in the active site of the enzyme in such a way that a water molecule on the sinister (si) side of PEP can be activated by direct coordination to the metal ion.

Introduction
3-Deoxy-D -manno-octulosonate (KDO) is an eight-carbon atom sugar present in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of all Gram-negative bacteria.1 3-Deoxy-D -manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8P synthase, EC 4.1.2.16) plays a key role in the biosynthesis of KDO.

lyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) to form KDO8P (precursor to KDO) and inorganic phosphate (Figure 1).1,2 Dephosphorylation of KDO8P to KDO, and synthesis of CMP-KDO (from CTP and KDO) occur prior to insertion of the sugar into LPS.3 Earlier studies have determined that the reaction of KDO8P synthesis is a sequential process in which the binding of PEP precedes the binding of A5P, and the release of inorganic phosphate precedes the release of KDO8P.4 The condensation step of the reaction is stereospecific, involving the addition of the sinister (si ) face of C3PEP to the rectus (re ) face of the A5P carbonyl group.5,6 It has been established that phosphate release occurs by cleavage of the C ­ O bond of PEP7,8 and that the anomeric oxygen atom of the product KDO8P originates from bulk solvent.8 A reaction very similar to KDO8P synthesis is the formation of 3-deoxy-D -arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P) from erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) and

Figure 1. Biosynthesis of KDO8P from A5P and PEP. Attack by a hydroxide ion on C2PEP leads to a transient carbanion at C3PEP that reacts with C1A5P. This transient species is shown in brackets, marked with a double-dagger symbol. Only the hydrogen atom of the hydroxide ion is shown.

PEP catalyzed by DAH7P synthase (DAH7PS, EC 4.1.2.15), which constitutes the first step of the shikimate pathway.9 KDO8PS and DAH7PS share several structural and mechanistic characteristics.10 ­ 13 However, while all the bacterial and eukaryotic DAH7P synthases require divalent metals for activity,14,15 two different classes of KDO8P synthases have been recognized with respect to their requirement for metals.16 We have determined the crystal structure of one member of the metal-free class, the Escherichia coli enzyme,13,17 and of one member of the metal-requiring class, the enzyme from the hyperthermophile Aquifex aeolicus.18 The structure of A. aeolicus KDO8PS ° provides the highest level of definition (1.8 A resolution) achieved so far for these enzymes. While the detailed mechanism of the E. coli enzyme is still debated,19 we have proposed that in the A. aeolicus enzyme a water molecule coordinated to the active-site metal ion starts the condensation reaction by attacking C2PEP (Figure 1).20 A. aeolicus KDO8PS requires a divalent cation for activity, with the level of activation varying over a tenfold range in the order:21 Cd2þ < Mn2þ . Ni2þ < Co2þ . Ca2þ . Cu2þ . Mg2þ < Zn2þ Although the native enzyme probably utilizes Fe2þ or Zn2þ,21 crystals of KDO8PS are typically maintained in the presence of Cd2þ.18 In the active site of the enzyme, the cadmium ion displays a distorted octahedral coordination with the thiolate group of Cys11, the 1 nitrogen atom of His185, the carboxylate moieties of Glu222 and Asp233, and a water molecule as ligands.18 The water molecule is in van der Waals contact with the si side of PEP, and is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the 1 nitrogen atom of His185 and the z nitrogen atom of Lys46. These features of the active site of A. aeolicus KDO8PS are particularly reminiscent of the homologous enzyme DAH7PS. The crystal structures of the E. coli phenylalanine-regulated DAH7PS in various complexed states show either Pb2þ or

Mn2þ bound in the active site and interacting with PEP.10,11 As expected, several residues in the coordination sphere of the active-site metal ion in DAH7PS (Cys61, His268, Glu302 and Asp326) have counterparts in the active site of A. aeolicus KDO8PS (Cys11, His185, Glu222 and Asp233). The specific role of Cys61 and His268 in DAH7PS has been addressed by both site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification. These studies have shown clearly that Cys61 is a metal ligand.14 Instead, it has been suggested that His268 is not important for metal binding, but that it plays a direct catalytic role.22 Here, we present crystallographic evidence that the equivalent histidine residue (His185) of A. aeolicus KDO8PS is necessary for the correct binding of PEP and of a catalytic water molecule in the active site.

Results
Metal content and activity of H185G KDO8PS Wild-type A. aeolicus KDO8PS produced in E. coli and purified from this bacterium contains Zn2þ and Fe2þ, with the ratio Zn2þ/Fe2þ ranging from 1 to 2 in different preparations.21 The total amount of metal is almost stoichiometric with the enzyme, such that, on average, two subunits of the tetramer contain Zn2þ and one or two contain Fe2þ. The presence of Fe2þ is probably responsible for the slightly pink color of the enzyme solutions and crystals.18 However, the enzyme is most active when the endogenous metal is removed by incubation with EDTA and replaced with Cd2þ.21 For this reason, all crystallographic studies of A. aeolicus KDO8PS have been carried out with the Cd2þ form of the enzyme; as expected from the absence of any iron, the solutions and crystals of the Cd2þ enzyme are colorless.18,20 As the structure of wild-type A. aeolicus shows that His185 is a ligand of the active-site metal ion, we have analyzed the metal content of the H185G mutant

enzyme produced in E. coli to determine whether the loss of a potential ligand alters the metalbinding properties of the enzyme. The results of the metal analysis carried out by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are shown in Table 1. Basically, the H185G enzyme is isolated with 0.5 equiv. of Zn2þ and very little else. The lack of Fe2þ is consistent with solutions of the H185G mutant enzyme not having the pink color of the wild-type. Thus, it appears that the loss of His185 as a ligand decreases the natural propensity of KDO8PS to bind iron. However, as in the wildtype enzyme, maximal activity (8 ­10% of the wild-type level) is obtained when the native metal is replaced with Cd2þ (Table 2). For this reason, the crystallographic studies of H185G KDO8PS (see below) were carried out with the Cd2þ form of the enzyme. Structure of substrate-free H185G KDO8PS Crystals of A. aeolicus KDO8PS belong to space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions a ¼ ° ° b ø 84.3 A, c ø 159.5 A, and diffract to approxi° mately 1.8 A. Although solution studies clearly indicate that, like the E. coli enzyme, A. aeolicus KDO8PS is a tetramer, the asymmetric unit of the crystals contains a homodimer.18 However, application of one of the operations of crystallographic symmetry (x ¼ y, y ¼ x, z ¼ 2 z ) of space group P3121 produces a tetrameric assembly of A. aeolicus KDO8PS that can be superimposed onto the E. coli ° enzyme with rmsd of only 1.22 A for 696 aligned a C atoms. The structure of substrate-free H185G KDO8PS (see Table 3 for data collection and refinement statistics) is almost indistinguishable from ° that of the wild-type (rmsd of 0.189 A for 503 a ordered, out of 528 total C atoms of the homoTable 2.

dimer contained in the asymmetric unit). In both subunits of the enzyme, the largest differences are observed in the active site, where the loss of the imidazole moiety of His185 leaves a cavity that is only partially filled by a water molecule (Figure 2). The temperature factor of the Cd2þ form ° (B ø 60 A2) is similar to that observed in the sub° strate-free wild-type enzyme (B ø 55 A2), but is significantly higher than in the structures of either ° the mutant (B ø 35 A2) or the wild-type ° 2) enzyme with bound PEP (see below), (B ø 30 A suggesting that the presence of this substrate contributes to stabilizing the metal ion in the active site. Distortion of the coordination sphere of the Cd2þ is evident in the positional shifts of Glu222 and Asp233 side-chains, and in the loss of His185 and water as ligands (Figure 2). A water molecule is still present in the vicinity of the metal ion, but not sufficiently close to act as a ligand. Additional small changes are observed in residues located in proximity of Gly185 and are likely to represent local adjustments compensating for the loss of His185 side-chain. Among these, most notable is a slight backbone displacement in the regions 184 ­ 191 and 220 ­243 (not shown), the latter stretch of residues forming one of the three loops that seal the active-site cavity from solvent.18 As in wildtype KDO8PS,18 two phosphate ions are bound near the opening and at the very bottom of the active-site channel (Figure 2), at the positions where the phosphate moieties of A5P and PEP bind when these substrates are included in the crystal holding solution. As discussed in previous

208

studies,13,17,18 phosphate ions are probably carried by the enzyme throughout the purification procedure, and remain bound in the active site until they are actively displaced by the substrates. Structure of H185G KDO8PS in complex with PEP The structure of the H185G mutant KDO8PS in complex with PEP (see Table 3 for data collection and refinement statistics) deviates minimally from ° that of the wild-type enzyme (rmsd of 0.198 A for a 508 ordered, out of 528 total C atoms in the asymmetric unit). However, the coordination sphere of the metal shows significant differences. In particular, the water molecule that, in the wild-type, is located on the si side of PEP and is directly coordinated to Cd2þ (Figure 3(A)) is now replaced by the carboxylate moiety of PEP, which appears to form a bidentate bond with the metal (Figure 3(B)). The position and interactions of the phosphate moiety of PEP are unchanged with respect to wild-type, such that direct metal coordination is made possible mostly through a rotation of the carboxyethyl moiety. The new orientation of PEP appears to be a direct consequence of the mutation, as the substrate carboxylic group partially overlaps the position formerly occupied by the 1 nitrogen atom of His185. PEP temperature factors are significantly higher than in the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that His185 contributes a significant fraction of the interaction energy between the substrate and the

protein active site. In the wild-type enzyme, the carboxylate moiety of Glu222 forms a bidentate bond with Cd2þ. In the mutant enzyme, the sidechain of Glu222 is shifted such that only one of the two carboxyl oxygen atoms remains clearly coordinated to Cd2þ (Table 4). Altogether, these changes produce in the mutant enzyme a significant distortion of the almost canonical octahedral coordination geometry of Cd2þ observed in the wild-type (compare Figure 3(A) and (B)). As with the substrate-free enzyme, small compensatory changes are observed near position 185, the most notable of which are a shift of Phe220, whose sidechain is in van der Waals contact with the imidazole moiety of His185 in the wild-type, and the already noted backbone displacements of regions

At this site, the phosphate moiety of A5P is stabilized by hydrogen

bonds to the backbone and side-chains of the L7 loop of the barrel (residues 187­ 201). The electron density of A5P is not well defined, such that only the positions of the phosphate moiety and of the bridging oxygen atom can be identified unambiguously (Figure 4(A)).18 In the active site of subunit B, where only PEP binds, the L7 loop is disordered. A similar situation is observed in the structure of the H185G enzyme in complex with A5P and PEP (see Table 3 for data collection and refinement statistics). A5P binds to only one of the two subunits in the asymmetric unit, and in this subunit the L7 loop becomes ordered and stabilizes the phosphate moiety and bridging oxygen atom. As observed in the wild-type enzyme, the remaining part of A5P is disordered (Figure 4(B)). Also in this structure, PEP binds to Cd2þ with its carboxylate moiety, while two water molecules are in the region of space occupied by the carboxylate moiety of PEP in its standard binding mode (Figure 4(B)). Analysis of the electron density around the metal ion (Figure 5) and of the metal ­ ligands distances (Table 4) suggests that in subunit A the carboxylate groups of Glu222 and PEP each provide only one coordination to Cd2þ. Therefore, in this active site Cd2þ has a tetrahedral rather than an octahedral coordination. As observed with the wild-type enzyme, A5P does not bind in subunit B, and the L7 loop is disordered. However, it is difficult to determine whether PEP binds at all in this second subunit. The electron density around the metal ion can be interpreted either as a water molecule coordinating directly Cd2þ with phosphate bound nearby, or as PEP bound at very low occupancy (not shown). While Glu222 appears to provide only one strong coordination to the metal (Table 4), it is not possible to know with certainty whether PEP would provide one or two bonds. Thus, at this site Cd2þ may have a coordination of order

higher than tetrahedral (Cys11, Glu222, Asp233, water or PEP).

Discussion
Two different classes of KDO8P synthases have been recognized with respect to their requirement for a metal ion.16 The absence or presence of metal in the active site may be associated with substantial differences in the way the reaction progresses. For example, Asojo et al.19 have proposed that non-metallo KDO8PS forms the postulated linear reaction intermediate stepwise via a transient oxocarbenium ion at C2PEP. In contrast, Duewel et al.20 favor an attack by a hydroxide ion on C2PEP with formation of a transient C3 carbanion as originally proposed by Hedstrom & Abeles (Figure 1).7 Interestingly, the coordination of Cd2þ in the A. aeolicus enzyme is very similar to that observed for Mn2þ in the structure of E. coli DAH7PS.11 What is the function of the metal in these enzymes? One possibility is that it serves a structural function such as that of orienting correctly the substrates or the reaction intermediate in the active site: for example, Duewel et al.20 have reported that in A. aeolicus KDO8PS a bisubstrate inhibitor mimicking the postulated linear intermediate coordinates the metal ion with one of its hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, while we have not observed significant changes in the position of PEP in A. aeolicus KDO8PS in the absence or in the presence of metal,18 in the crystal structure of the E. coli DAH7PS in complex with Mn2þ and the PEP analog, 2-phosphoglycolate (PGL), the octahedral coordination of the metal ion is completed by the carboxylate moiety of PGL, which substitutes for PEP in the active site.11 In this study, we have investigated the effects of the H185G mutation on

Figure 6. Hydrogen bond chains in the active site of wild-type KDO8PS. Note how the water molecule coordinated to Cd2þ is within hydrogen bond distance from the 1 nitrogen atom of His185 and from the z nitrogen atom of Lys46. Two possible pathways for proton translocation from the catalytic water molecule coordinated to Cd2þ to the bridging oxygen atom of PEP are represented with broken-line bonds. The first path includes His185, Asp182 and Lys124. The second path includes Lys46, Asp81 and two water molecules. Coordinates for this Figure are from PDB entry 1FWW.

the metal content of the native enzyme purified from E. coli extracts, and on the coordination of the active-site metal in the Cd2þ substituted enzyme. While the wild-type enzyme, as purified, contains between 0.25 equiv. and 0.5 equiv. of Fe2þ, and 0.5 equiv. of Zn2þ,21 the mutant enzyme contains only Zn2þ. Thus, loss of His185 seems to decrease the natural affinity of the enzyme for iron. However, the mutation does not affect the rate enhancement that occurs when the endogenous metal (Fe2þ or Zn2þ) is replaced with Cd2þ (Table 2). Furthermore, regardless of the type of metal bound in the active site, the H185G enzyme retains approximately 8% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). Thus, the decreased activity observed in the mutant does not appear to be a consequence of the particular type of metal present in the active site, but is likely to be a direct consequence of the loss of a function associated directly with His185. In this context, it is worth noting that when the Cd2þ form of the H185G enzyme was analyzed by X-ray crystallography, the amount of Cd2þ bound in the active site (as estimated from its occupancy and temperature factor) was found to be similar to that of the wildtype (Figures 2 ­5). Altogether, these observations suggest that metal loss is not responsible for the decreased activity in H185G. Notably, a similar conclusion was reached by Howe et al.22 for the

equivalent His268 of DAH7PS. In that study, comparison of the UV spectra of H268G and of wild-type DAH7PS saturated with Cu2þ revealed no differences in the binding of Cu2þ between the two enzyme forms. When PEP and A5P are added together to the H185G mutant, the L7 loop becomes ordered and seals the active site from the external solvent. As noted with the wild-type enzyme, this phenomenon occurs only in molecule A of the asymmetric unit.18 In molecule B, the L7 loop is disordered and the active site is open. This difference between the two subunits has been interpreted as representative of a mechanism of alternating-site catalysis,18 and it has been proposed that His185 might play a key role in this mechanism.18 His185 is located at the very beginning of the L7 loop (residues 187 ­ 201), and near both substrates, such that it might act as a transducer of information from the active site to this loop. However, the observation that the opening and closing of the L7 loop on alternate sites of the enzyme is not affected in the mutant H185G suggests that His185 is not involved in this regulatory process. What is then the function of His185? The unusual binding mode of PEP and the consequent distortion of the metal coordination geometry seem to be a direct consequence of the loss of His185, as PEP partially fills the position formerly occupied by the imidazole moiety of this residue. However, direct binding of PEP to the metal in the mutant enzyme should not in itself be a factor hampering catalysis, as this binding mode brings C3PEP closer to C1A5P, and would actually favor the condensation of the two substrates without affecting the stereochemistry of the reaction. Instead, the loss of activity observed in the mutant H185G might be the consequence of several factors that together concur to depress catalysis. For example, the strength itself of PEP binding in the altered position appears to be significantly less than in the wild-type, as attested by the fact that, despite the high resolution of these structures, the electron density for PEP is quite weak (Figures 3 ­5) and the temperature factors of PEP atoms are rather large. Another factor could be the loss of the water molecule that in the wild-type is located on the si side of PEP and is directly coordinated to the metal. In a previous study,20 we have proposed that the first step in the condensation of the two substrates is the activation to a hydroxide ion of this water molecule and its subsequent attack onto C2PEP. A water molecule near the metal ion is not visible in the structure of the substrate-free H185G enzyme (Figure 2), possibly because of the loss of a stabilizing hydrogen bond between the water molecule and the 1 nitrogen atom of His185. Furthermore, coordination of water is prevented in the structures in which PEP binds directly to the metal ion (Figures 3 and 4). If this water molecule is intimately involved in catalysis, how can the H185G mutant retain 8% of activity? The

212

most likely explanation is that some residual binding of PEP in the correct position still occurs in the mutant, although the low occupancy of PEP (, 10%) at this site would prevent its detection in the crystals. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that the temperature factors of PEP atoms are quite high, suggesting that this substrate is quite mobile in the active site of the mutant enzyme. Altogether, these observations indicate that the primary role of His185 is that of orienting PEP in the active site correctly in relationship to the metal ion. However, His185 could be involved in other more subtle functions. For example, while the hydroxide ion originated from the metal-coordinated water molecule ultimately becomes the anomeric oxygen atom of the product (Figure 1), the extracted proton must be disposed of in order to regenerate the general base for the next reaction cycle. Only two amino acid residues, His185 and Lys46, are sufficiently close to this water molecule to potentially act as a general base (Figure 6). His185 is part of a network of hydrogen bonds, including Asp182 and Lys124, that ends with the bridging oxygen atom of PEP (Figure 6); during the course of the reaction, this atom becomes the bridging oxygen atom of the linear intermediate (see Figure 1). This structural feature may be of relevance in view of the fact that KDO8PS is one of only four known PEP-utilizing enzymes in which phosphate release from PEP occurs by cleavage of the C ­ O rather than the P ­O bond (the homologous DAH7PS, UDP-Nacetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase representing the other three members of this group). Interestingly, the same triad of residues (His268, Asp265, and Lys186) exists in DAH7PS.11 Thus, a proton extracted from water by His185 could move along the chain of hydrogen bonds to ultimately reach the phosphate oxygen atom concurrently with the breaking of the C ­ O bond. As protonated histidine cannot be a metal ligand, this mechanism is expected to involve a transient disengagement of His185 from Cd2þ coordination and may require a rotation of the His185 side-chain in order to shuttle a proton from water to Asp182. Consistent with this hypothesis, chemical modification with diethylpyrocarbonate of the equivalent His268 in DAH7PS suggested that this residue is possibly involved directly in catalysis as a general base.22 Alternatively, His185 could be involved in properly orienting the water molecule coordinated to Cd2þ, and the catalytic base could be Lys46. The z nitrogen atom of this residue is part of a chain of hydrogen bonds that includes Asp81 and two water molecules, and ends on the bridging oxygen atom of the linear intermediate (Figure 6). The corresponding chain of hydrogen bonds, involving Lys97, Glu143 and two water molecules, is present in the homologous DAH7PS.11 While the hydrogen bond chain involving Lys46 is intact in H185G KDO8PS, disruption of the hydrogen bond chain

associated with His185, may be a critical factor that further impairs catalysis in this enzyme. According to this view, the decreased activity of the H185G enzyme could be due to a combination of factors, including incorrect binding of PEP, loss or destabilization of a critical catalytic water molecule, and inefficient protonation of a leaving group.

Materials and Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis The construction of a plasmid containing the kdsA gene coding for wild-type A. aeolicus KDO8PS has been reported.23 This plasmid served as template for PCR mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit.24,25 The potential mutagenic plasmids were used to transform competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells. Plasmid DNA from selected clones was characterized by restriction digests and DNA sequencing. The plasmid containing the mutant sequence was used to transform competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression and purification. Protein purification and metal analysis Recombinant H185G KDO8PS was isolated and the enzyme activity measured as described23 at 80 8C in the presence of 3 mM A5P, 3 mM PEP, with or without 0.5 mM CdCl2. To determine the metal content of KDO8PS directly following purification, samples of the enzyme were dialyzed extensively against 5 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.5), at 4 8C. Following dialysis, the concentration of the dialyzed enzyme was determined and subjected to metal analysis. A sample of the dialysate was analyzed in order to determine the metal content of the dialysis buffer. The quantification of individual metals in the enzyme and buffer samples was determined by high-resolution ICP-MS on a Finnigan MAT ELEMENT instrument at the W. M. Keck Elemental Geochemistry Laboratory (Department of Geology, University of Michigan). The detection limits of this instrument in parts per trillion are as follows: calcium, 30; cadmium, 0.8; cobalt, 0.1; copper, 10; iron, 10; manganese, 2; nickel, 2; zinc, 10. Protein crystallization Crystals of the recombinant protein (spacegroup ° ° P3121; a ¼ b ø 84.3 A, c ø 159.5 A) were obtained as described18 and incubated in a cryo-protectant holding solution (50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 21% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 16% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (w/v) ethylene glycol, 100 mM CdCl2), in the absence or presence of 8 mM PEP, 10 mM A5P. In the absence of any substrate, crystals of the H185G enzyme do not diffract as well and decay rapidly (Table 1). Structure determination and refinement Data sets were collected at 100 K with an R-axis IV image plate detector at the Cu Ka wavelength (Table 1). Oscillation data were processed with HKL.26 Model refinement was carried out with CNS version 127 using cross-validated maximum likelihood as the target function.28 Solvent molecules were added during the

final stages of refinement after the protein model had stabilized. Least-squares superpositions were carried out with the program LSQMAN.29 The Figures were drawn with MOLSCRIPT,30 Bobscript31 and Raster-3D.32 Protein Data Bank code numbers The structure factor amplitudes and the refined coordinates of A. aeolicus KDO8PS in the various complexed states described here have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank as entries 1LRN, 1LRO, and 1LRQ.
