Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.19) from Bacillus circulans has been purified, crystallized and analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The enzyme is monomeric. SDS/ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave an J!!, of 73,600( rt lOOO), corresponding to 670( f 10) amino acid residues. The structure of the crystalline enzyme has been elucidated at a resolution of 3.4 A, using multiple isomorphous replacement and solvent flattening for phase determination. The resulting electron density map allowed tracing of the polypeptide chain; 664 residue positions have been assigned. The chain fold has been subdivided into five domains. The N-terminal domain forms a (@),-barrel, which contains the second domain of about 55 residues as an insert after the third b-strand. The three remaining domains form almost exclusively P-pleated sheet structures and consist of about 90, 80 and 95 residues. The chain fold of the three N-terminal domains of 492 residues resembles closely the two known structures of a-amylases. This geometric similarity corresponds to the observed amino acid sequence homology. On the basis of the sequence homology with a-amylases, the active center can be located. The fourth domain has an immunoglobulin fold and is far away from the active center, while the fifth domain participates in the formation of the broad depression at the active center. Accordingly, the cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase chain fold can be considered as an a-amylase chain fold with two additional domains.

1. Introduction
The a-glucans starch and glycogen are common storage carbohydrates found in nature. Accordingly, starch and glycogen hydrolyzing enzymes are widely distributed in numerous groups of prokaryotic and eukaryotic micro-organisms. Many bacteria and fungi produce extracellular a- and /I-amylases or glucoamylases for the degradation of high molecular weight carbon sources into fragments that can be imported into the cell (Marshall, 1972; French, 1975). There exists a small group of bacteria, however, that degrade starches or starchlike compounds with the aid of cyclodextrin glyco-

amylases, i.e. cellular cyclodextrin-degrading cyclodextrinases (DePinto & Campbell, 1968; Suzuki & Imai, 1985; Bender, 1986), whereas the CGTase-producing strain of Klebsiella pneunzoniae has intracellular CGTase and amylomaltase as well as maltodextrinphosphorylase, which are involved in cyclodextrin metabolism (Bender, 1977a,b). The cyclodextrins have considerable technical applications (Szejtli, 1988). Mostly, they are used as micro-encapsulators for stabilizing light- and airsensitive as well as volatile compounds, or for

syltransferase (CGTaset, EC 2.4.1.19). CGTase is excreted into the medium and converts the substrates partly into cyclodextrins. These cyclic compounds can be imported into the cells and metabolized. The CGTase-producing bacilli have intra-

About a dozen CGTase-producing bacterial species are known at present (Bender, 1986; Hofmann, 1989).

et al. isoelectric focussing. The electrophoresis gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue revealed only 1 protein band with M, 73,600( &- 1000). The small error is based on the use of closely homologous proteins as markers. Isoelectric focussing gave 2 major bands with p1 values of&O and %4 as well as a minor band (less than 5%) with p1 69. Repeated isoelectric focussing after storage of the enzyme preparation for several months showed that the protein fraction with p1 %4 had decreased at the cost of the fraction with pI %O. The p1 8.0 and p1 &4 fractions could be separated by ion exchange chromatography using a linear NaCl gradient (Sepharose S fast flow from Pharmacia, Sweden, gel bed volume 100 ml, flow rate 114.5 cm/h, elution buffer 15 mm-triethanolamine .

chain parts, and cG, cyclodextrins. The ring size x is mainly 6, 7 or 8; the corresponding names are a-, fi-, and y-cyclodextrins. Depending on the initially formed cyclodextrin, the enzymes are classified as LX-,/?- and y-CGTases. The amino acid sequences of seven CGTases have been elucidated at the DNA level (Binder et al., 1986; Sugimoto et al., 1986; Takano et al.. 1986; Kimura et al., 1987; Kaneko et al.. 1988; Horikoshi, 1988; Schmid et al., 1988). The CGTases of the bacilli are homologous, with 60 to 8Oo/o identical amino acid residues and molecular weights around 74,000, which corresponds to about 680 residues. K. pneumoniae is the only Gram-negative bacterium known to produce CGTase. The sequence of this CGTase has only 625 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 69,000 (Binder et al., 1986). Sequence similarities between a-amylases and CGTases have been observed for four highly conserved chain segments, which may include amino acid residues that participate in catalysis (Binder et aE., 1986; Kimura et al.. 1987). These similarities suggest that a-amylases and CGTases are related to each other, although the former are hydrolases whereas the latter are transferases. We report the three-dimensional structure of the CGTase from B. circulans, which belongs to the B-type. From a comparison of sequence fragments, this enzyme is closely homologous (70 to 80% identical amino acid residues) to the CGTase of an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. (Kimura et al.. 1987).

sodium-citrate (pH 50), 0 to 50 mM-NaCl, 400 mg of protein). There was no difference in the crystallization behavior between total CGTase and the fractions separated by ion exchange chromatography. Accordingly, crystals from total CGTase were used for X-ray analysis throughout. For cystallization we used the hanging-drop method with 10 to 20-~1 drops and 1 ml reservoir. The drops consisted of 50% (v/v) protein solution with 7 to 15 mg CGTase/ml in 50 m&i-triethanolamine . HCl/sodiumcitrate (pH 6.7), @5% polyethylene glycol (PEG-1500 analytical grade, Serva, F.R.G.), 50% reservoir solution. The reservoir solution was identical with the protein solution except that it contained 0.9 to 1.0 M-ammonium sulfate and no protein. Crystals suitable for X-ray analysis grew within 4 weeks after seeding each drop with 1 cystal of about 0.03 mm x @03 mm x @2 mm. The 0.3 mm x obtained maximum dimensions were @3mmx3mm. (b) Crystal

2. Materials
(a) Enzyme production,

and Methods
purijkation and cqstallization

From wheat bran we isolated a bacillus (strain no. 8)
that produces CGTase in good yields. It was identified to belong to the B. circulans group. Being prototrophic, it

was grown (3O"C, 30 h) in minimal medium (100 mMpotassium phosphate at pH 7.2, 4 g ammonium sulfate/l, @2 g sodium citrate/l, 0.1 g MgCl,/l, 15 mg FeSO,/l) with
1 o/o (w/v) starch as the carbon source. The extracellular CGTase was isolated from the culture filtrate of a 200 1 culture. The filtrate was concentrated to 10 1 by ultrafiltration (Romicon hollow fiber cartridge, cut-off 10,000). Some viscous material was precipitated by CaCl, (final concentration 24 mm) and removed by centrifugation (12,000 revs/min, 30 min). The supernatant was applied to an affinity chromatography column containing p-cyclodextrin (Wacker Chemie. F.R.G.) covalently bound to Sepharose-6B (Pharmacia, Sweden) via the spacer (Sigma) 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (Sundberg 6 Porath, 1974; L&z16 et al., 1981). For the preparation, a gel bed of 700 ml and a flow rate of 23.4 cm/h were used. After application of the protein, the column was washed with . HCl/NaOH buffer 4 x ~tota* of 20 mw-triethanolamine (pH 6.7). and the CGTase was eluted using the same buffer with 1 y. /&cyclodextrin. Three grams of protein in a total volume of 400 ml were obtained from a 200 1 culture filtrate. The protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% saturation) and stored at 4°C. Protein samples of 2 pg, 5 pg and 8 pg were analyzed by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together with the CGTase from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain l-l (Schmid et al., 1988) and Bacillus macerans (Takano et al., 1986), the sequences of which are known. and also by

For storage we transferred the crystals to a buffer containing 50 mM-triethanolamine . HCl/sodium-citrate at pH 67, 1.1 M-ammonium sulfate, 1.0% PEG-1500 and 5 mg CGTase/ml (saturated). We did not succeed in stabilizing the crystals in the absence of CGTase, e.g. crystals decay within a few days if 3 instead of 5 mg/ml are used. For crystal mounting we used the same buffer, but 1.5 M-ammonium sulfate and no protein. From X-ray precession photographs (Camera Y925, Enraf Nonius, Delft, NL) taken with a rotating anode generator (model GX6, Enraf Nonius, Delft, NL) the crystal space group was established as P2,2,2,. with unit cell parameters a = 948 8, b = 1047 A, c = 114.0 A (1 A = 0.1 nm). The crystal density was determined by dropping CGTase crystals into a gradient of toluene/bromobenzene, which had been calibrated with droplets of CsCl solutions. The resulting crystal density was 1.200 (*@015) g/ml. Accounting for the density of the crystal mounting buffer of 1.120 g/ml and assuming a protein density of 1.34 g/ml. this converts (Cramer et al.. 1970) to 1.1 ( f02) molecules/ asymmetric unit. Thus, the solvent content of the CGTase crystals is as high as SS%, so that phase improvement by solvent flattening becomes an attractive option. (c) X-ray data collection

Intensity data were collected on an automated 4-circle diffractometer (modified model P2,. Nicolet, U.S.A.) at 6°C using Ni-filtered CuKcl radiation from a fine-focus sealed-off tube. Scan evaluation and corrections for background, absorption and radiation damage were done as described earlier (Thieme et aZ.. 1981). All data were collected in 3 shells up to resolutions of 59 A, 4.4 A and 3.4 A, containing about 3500,440O and 8700 independent reflections, respectively. The widths of the reflections at a

level of 10% of the maximum were 93" to 05" so that we used omega-scan ranges of 04" to 96". The data quality R-factor between was monitored by an internal symmetry-related reflections (Thieme et al., 1981). For the native datasets we observed RF values around 7 u/0 in shells 1 and 2 and 10% in shell 3. The platinum derivate data had R:' values of 6% in all 3 shells, while the uranyl derivative showed RF values around 11% in shells 1 and 2. For every dataset we used one single crystal. We measured 2 native datasets, one to 44 A and one to 3.4 A resolution, and averaged them. In addition, a native dataset containing only 40 strong reflections from each shell was measured and used throughout for scaling. For the native and the platinum derivative datasets, the radiation damage was below 15%, whereas the uranyl derivative dataset had up to 25% damage. Typical crystal sizes and measuring times were 0.2 mm x 0.25 mm x 1.0 mm and 30 s/reflection, respectively. (d) Heavy-atom derivatives and m.i.r. map

In order to find suitable derivatives, we soaked the crystals in 22 different heavy-atom compounds. Intensity changes were monitored visually by taking X-ray precession photographs of the hOZ-plane. In 8 cases appreciable intensity changes were observed and data were collected on a diffractometer, 2 derivatives were suitable for analysis to higher resolution. The phasing procedure was initiated by the interpretation of the platinum difference Patterson function (Blundell & Johnson, 1976) in terms of sites no. 1 and no. 2 given in Table 1. Site 3 of the platinum derivative as well as the uranyl site were then detected in difference Fourier maps, The heavy-atom parameters were refined using the method of Dickerson et al. (1968). The data are given in Table 1. With the resulting phases, we calculated an electron density map at 5.9 A resolution to begin with. This map showed clearly the solvent and protein regions so that the molecular boundaries could be outlined. Using a protein density of 1.34 g/ml the volume within this outline converts to M, = 79.000, which is only 10% larger than the M, derived from SDS/polyacryalmide gel electrophoresis. As a next step. the m.i.r. phases and a corresponding map were calculated to 3.4 A resolution. The density was represented on a display system (model PS-330, Evans & Sutherland, U.S.A.). At this resolution, the position and the chirality of the a-helices became clear. Apart from the cc-helices. however, the chain could not be followed with certainty. (e) Phase improvement by solvent flattening

Since the crystals contain the comparatively large fraction of 687; solvent and since the m.i.r. phases are of limited quality (Table l), we improved the phases by solvent flattening. For this purposes we followed the procedure of Wang (1985), using the program version of Leslie (1987), which accelerates the production of the protein mask appreciably. The unit cell was sampled at 96 x 108 x 120 grid points. The Wang procedure combines the observed m.i.r. phase probabilities with the phase probability distributions calculated from the structure factors of a current improved map according to Sim (1959). Firstly. we derived the protein mask from the m.i.r. map using an averaging sphere of 10 A and a level adjustment to 50qb solvent so that the mask exceeds the protein volume by more than 507,;. With this mask we started solvent

flattening iterations that were halted when the 4th cycle gave an average phase angle change below 5". The resulting improved map was used for calculating a 2nd mask with the same averaging sphere but adjusted to 55% solvent. After 3 further iterations, a final mask was derived in the same manner but at a level of 60% solvent. At this level, the mask still exceeded the protein volume by 25%. Using this mask, the final improved phases and the corresponding map were obtained when the solvent flattening iterations converged after 10 cycles. The whole procedure required 8 h central processor unit time on a MicroVAX-II (Digital Equipment Corp., F.R.G.). A comparison between final and m.i.r. structure factors showed an average phase angle change of 41". Relating this value to the average phase angle change of arc cos (1~0s ~1) = 505" between exact single isomorphous replacement phases and corresponding exact m.i.r. phases demonstrates that the change and therefore the expected improvement is substantial. An appreciable improvement is also indicated bg the difference between the average figure-of-merits of 046 for the m.i.r. structure factors (Table 1) and 0.83 for the final structure factors.

3. Results and Discussion
(a) Data analysis and chain fold

map and model-building

The Fourier transform of the final structure factors yielded the final electron density distribution, which was drawn out at a scale 10 mm = 3.4 A and mounted on plexi-glass. This minimap was used for chain tracing. Model-building was done on a display system with the program package FRODO (Jones, 1978; Pflugrath et al., 1984). Since only a small fraction of the amino acid sequence is known, the model was built as polyalanine. In order to reduce geometric errors in the main chain we ran 5 cycles of the program PROFFT (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980; Finzel, 1987) using the observed structure factors as restraints. This procedure reduced the average bond length and bond angle deviations from 0.13 A and 12" to 0.03 A and 7". respectively. The total root-mean-

The large molecular weight of CGTase together with orthorhombic space group symmetry gave rise to crystals with cell axes around 100 A (Hofmann et al., 1987). Crystals grown under similar conditions were recently also reported for CGTase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Kubota at al., 1988). These ceil dimensions challenged our diffractometer to its limits. After finding and refining two heavyatom derivatives, we calculated an m.i.r. electron density map at 3.4 A resolution. In this map, all a-helices could be identified with respect to size and chirality. There remained a number of ambiguities, however, in the connections between the cc-helices and in the connections in the /?-sheet domains. After solvent flattening, we obtained a 3.4 A electron density map that allowed a much more detailed interpretation. The map quality is illustrated in Figure 1. In this map the main chain could be traced unambiguously for about 570 amino acid residues. The a-helix directions could be deduced from their general side-chain orientations. All directions agreed with each other and showed that this chain part is N-terminal. From the visual inspection of the fold, these 570 residues can be subdivided into four regions: domains A, B, C and D. Domain B is inserted into domain A; domains C and D are separate entities. The C-terminal 100 residues form domain E, which consists mostly of B-sheet strands. Here, the exact connections in two turn regions

remain ambiguous. We decided to adopt the connections that fit the densities best. The resulting P-sheet is completely antiparallel. The fuzzy regions register around residues 570 and 597, and 655 and 664. In the current interpretation the total chain comprises 664 residues. The resulting chain fold is shown in Figure 2. Although this Figure provides a good overview, it is too overloaded for following the chain easily. We therefore present the same chain fold as an explosion graph for each domain separately in Figure 3(a) to (e). From the &f, 73,600( f 1000) derived from SDS/ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see above), a chain length of 670( + 10) residues may be calculated, if the average molecular weight per residue of 110 of the bacilli CGTases with known sequences is applied. This chain length agrees, within the limits of error, with our map interpretation of 664 residues, indicating that no substantial parts of the chain are missing. Additions and deletions of a number of single or double residues in less welldefined loop regions at the surface have to be expected (Thieme et al., 1981). These may easily add up to a total difference of ten residues. The CGTases of other bacilli with known sequence have around 680 residues. The most closely related CGTase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 1011 (Kimura et aZ.. 1987) has 686 residues. (b) The (/?a),-barrel The N-terminal part of the polypeptide chain folds as a (@),-barrel, which is usually called TIMbarrel because it has been found initially in triose phosphate iso,merase (Banner et al., 1975). Now, more than a dozen TIM-barrels are known; they have been reviewed by Chothia (1988). A head-on view of this barrel is given in Figure 4, it comprises residues 1 to 140 and 195 to 403. Domain B is inserted after the third B-strand. Thus, CGTase joins the club of TIM-barrel proteins.

Among the proteins in which TIM-barrels have been detected previously, there are the Takaamylase (Matsuura et al., 1984) and the a-amylase from porcine pancreas (Buisson et al., 1987). These amylases accept the same substrates as the CGTases but catalyze predominantly hydrolysis. Like CGTase, both amylases have a domain B of about 60 residues inserted after the third j-strand. An overlay of the chain fold of domains A and B of Taka-amylase (Matsuura et al., 1984), which was taken from the Protein Data Bank (file BTAA, Bernstein et al., 1977), on the (@),-barrel of CGTase showed close chain fold correspondence.
(c) Structural comparkons

The chain fold similarity with Taka-amylase is not restricted to the barrel (domains A and B) but extends to domain C, which consists of residues 403 to 492 and folds as a P-sheet with greek key topology (Richardson, 1981). Since also the relative positions of domains A, B and C are similar in the amylases and CGTase, CGTase may be considered as a prolonged amylase. Domains D and E, which contain about 80 and 95 residues, are added. Both additions fold into antiparallel B-sheet topologies (Fig. 3). Domain D has the frequently observed topology of an immunoglobulin domain (Schiffer et al., 1973; Huber, 1976). Among the proteins with this fold there is also an cr-amylase inhibitor from Streptomyces tendae (Pflugrath et al.. 1986). homology between the However, no sequence CGTase of the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 1011 (which is the most closely related CGTase, see below) and the Cl-domain of human y-immunoglobulin or the a-amylase inhibitor could be detected. The structural similarity with the a-amylases was to some extent anticipated because sequence similarities within four short regions of about half a dozen residues of a CGTase and a-amylases had been reported by Binder et al. (1986). We have

looked at this similarity in more detail by

comparing the sequences of Taka-amylase (Toda et al., 1982) and CGTase from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 1011 (Kimura et al., 1987). This CGTase is the enzyme of known sequence that is functionally and in sequence most closely related to the CGTase analyzed here. The homology between the two CGTases can be estimated from sequence comparisons between three chain fragments comprising the 15 N-terminal residues, 15 residues around position 130 (Hofmann, 1989), and the 110 C-terminal

residues (Nitschke, 1989). These fragments have 73%, 73% and 74% identical amino acid residues, respectively. Since the homologies between the CGTases of known sequence are uniformly distributed over the chain (Hofmann, 1989), the observed fragment values indicate a total homology of 70% to 80% identical residues between the two CGTases.

Figure 5. Sequence comparison between all residues of Taka-amylase (Toda et al., 1982) and the 500 N-terminal residues of CGTase from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 1011 (Kimura et al., 1987), which is functionally and in sequence most closely related to the CGTase analyzed here. The applied program follows that of McLachlan (197 1) and uses the similarity matrix MDM78 (Schwartz & Dayhoff, 1978). The segment length is 17 residues. Similarities are drawn as continuous lines if they exceed the level of 3.4 standard deviations above the average. In addition, the alignment along the diagonal has broken lines for similarities between 1.7 and 3.4 standard deviations above average. The aligned segments are (amylase start-end/CGTase start-end): 9 to 28/15 to 34, 29 to 50/41 to 62, 51 to 71/65 to 85, 72 to 125/90 to 143, 196 to 2171219 to 240, 218 to 2421245 to 269,243 to 3421274 to

Dayhoff (1978), we found the evident homology shown in Figure 5. With a segment length of 17 residues, there were 225 residues (51 y. of domains A and C) aligned at 3.4 standard deviations above the average. For this alignment, eight shifts of up to six residues each were introduced. The next best alignment was clearly inferior as it relates only 52 residues at this level and requires ten much larger shifts. Moreover, t,he given alignment could be extended, without further shifts, to a total of 338 residues (77 o/o of domains A and C) at a level of 1.7 standard deviations above average (Fig. 5). The alignment resulted in 22% identical amino acid residues, as related to the cr-amylase. Therefore, we conclude that the sequences of the a-amylase and the CGTase are homologous over the whole amylase chain, except for domain B. The B domains have deviating sequences but still show the same fold. The observed homology allows us to suggest that the active centers of both enzymes are at equivalent positions. Since the active site of cr-amylases is known to be located at the C-terminal ends of the P-strands of the TIM-barrel (Matsuura et aE., 1984; Buisson et al., 1987); the same most likely applies for CGTase. The general area of the active site can be visualized in Figure 2. It consists of a broad depression in the structure. Domains B and E participate in the formation of this depression.

4. Conclusion

and Outlook

We have found that CGTase has a chain fold very similar to that of the known cr-amylases, but contains two additional domains, one of which contributes to the active center. This addition may correlate with the functional change from a hydrolyzing enzyme (a-amylase) to a group-transferring

452/460 to 479. Domain A (= TIM-barrel) and domain C
are aligned. The large alignment gap around residue number 170 corresponds to domain B (residues 140 to 195 of CGTase), which is about the same size in both enzymes. There are 22 y0 identical amino acid residues as compared to the amylase.

enzyme (CGTase). Work on a more detailed structural model is continuing. The enzyme is cloned (Nitschke, 1989). In the future, we intend to use this clone for protein-engineering endeavours, the most obvious being the conversion of the enzyme to an exclusive producer of a given cyclodextrin ring size.
