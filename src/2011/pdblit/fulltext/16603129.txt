The catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10) has been ° expressed in Escherichia coli and its crystal structure solved at 2.1 A resolution. The availability of this structure allowed us to critically examine the small differences existing between the catalytic domains of MMP-3 and MMP-10, which show the highest sequence identity among all MMPs. Furthermore, the binding mode of N-isobutyl-N-[4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl]glycyl hydroxamic acid (NNGH), which is one of the most known commercial inhibitors of MMPs, is described for the first time.

Introduction
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) constitute a family of enzymes that are secreted by living cells to modify the surrounding environment. They belong to the class of hydrolases and are specialized in endopeptidase activity. In multicellular eukaryotes they are involved in tissue degradation/remodeling,1,2 which they achieve by hydrolyzing extracellular matrix components, such as all forms of collagen, gelatin and elastin. New members of the human MMP family have been continuously discovered in the last 20 years, until the final deposition of the human genome has fixed the final number at 24, five of which possess an additional shorter isoform.3,4 All MMPs have in common a catalytic domain constituted by about 170 residues. The domain contains a zinc ion, which is responsible for the peptide hydrolysis reaction. Another zinc ion and one to three calcium ions are present in the catalytic domain with a structural role.5 All but two of the human MMPs (MMP-7 and MMP-26) have a C-terminal hemopexin-like domain,3,6 and two MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9) contain fibronectin insertions into their

catalytic domains.7,8 All MMPs share a marked sequence similarity, and the similarity is maximal for the catalytic domains, where the percentage of identical residues ranges from a minimum of 33% (between MMP-21 and MMP-23) to a maximum of 86% (between MMP-3 and MMP-10). Because of their involvement in numerous pathologies such as tumor development, tumor metastasis, arthritis rheumatoides and pulmonary emphysema,9 ­ 12 they are attractive drug targets. It has been relatively easy to design molecules with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range for the active site of the catalytic domain of MMPs. However, adverse side effects observed in clinical trials have so far prevented MMP-directed drugs from reaching the market. The major, if not the only, cause of the side effects is related to the low selectivity of these drugs related to the high similarity among the members of the MMP family and to their inhibitory activity towards other nonMMP metalloproteinases.13,14 It is becoming increasingly clear that to achieve selective inhibition of any human MMP one has to rely on strategies that either exploit the peculiarities of some MMPs (e.g. the fibronectin domains15,16) or rest on a very accurate structural description of the catalytic domains of all MMPs. Only in the latter case one can employ rational drug design to exploit even relatively small differences at, or close to, the enzyme active site. High resolution 3D structures of the catalytic domains of only nine

In an effort to fill the gap of structural knowledge on human MMPs we have expressed the catalytic domain of MMP-10 and solved its crystal ° structure at 2.1 A resolution. MMP-10 (stromelysin-2), similarly to the better known MMP-3 (stromelysin-1), is active towards the hydrolysis of aggrecan, collagen III, IV and V, elastin, fibronectin, gelatin I, link protein, casein and fibrinogen.27 Other catalytic activities known for MMP-3 have not been tested for MMP-10, so there is as yet no evidence of a qualitatively different biological function between these two MMPs. On the other hand, the two proteins exhibit differences in cellular synthesis and inducibility by cytokines and growth factors in vitro.28 The availability of this structure allowed us to critically examine the small differences existing between the catalytic domains of MMP-3 and MMP-10, which, as discussed before, show the highest sequence identity among MMPs. The rationale for this work is that of making available to the rational drug design community the structures of the pair of MMPs that are most similar. If a candidate drug can be made which shows sufficient discrimination between these two domains it is likely that this drug can be also refined to discriminate against all other MMPs.

Results and Discussion
Description of the structure The monoclinic (space group C2) crystals of the truncated catalytic domain of the MMP-10 in complex with the hydroxamate-based N-isobutyl-N-[4methoxyphenylsulfonyl]glycyl hydroxamic acid

(NNGH) inhibitor29,30 contain three independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. The three molecules differ only in minor structural details (vide infra). The MMP-10 molecule displays the classical structure common to the other matrix metalloproteinases, which consists of three a-helices and a twisted five-stranded b-sheet with a further two short b-strands and two intervening large loops L1 and L2 in a b1-a1-b2-b3-L1-b4-b5a2-L2-a3 topology, where the five-stranded twisted b-sheet is formed by b2-b1-b3-b5-b4. The N-terminal part of the molecule is rich in secondary structures (Figure 1) with the amphiphilic a1-helix separating the b1 and b2 strands of the twisted b-sheet. The a1-helix packs against the a2helix, which is followed by a long stretch of unstructured polypeptide ending in the C-terminal a3-helix spatially close to the N terminus. As in the other metalloproteinase structures, the b-sheet is composed of four parallel (b2-b1-b3-b5) and one antiparallel (b4) strands (Figure 1). The b-sheet provides two of the residues (His182, His195), which bind the structural Zn2 ion, the other two being provided by the wide L1 loop (His167, Asp169) which folds over the b-sheet sandwiching the zinc ion (Figure 1). The catalytic zinc-binding site is inserted between a2 and the following large loop where the metal ion is bound to His217, His221 and His227 (Figure 1). His217 and His221 belong to a2 and His227 stems from the loop that covers the site, by making a large bend encompassing the residues Pro237­ Ala246. Adjacent to the catalytic site lies the S10 hydrophobic pocket defined by Leu180, Leu213, Val214, Leu234, Pro237, Leu238 and Tyr239 with Phe248 at the bottom. Three calcium-binding sites have been found in each subunit where they lie approximately in the plane of b3, b5 and b4 strands of the b-sheet and are bound to residues from the b-turns of the sheet (Figure 1). The three molecules (ABC) are very similar, with

° RMSDs on the Ca atoms ranging between 0.53 A ° ° for the AB couple to 0.61 A and 0.63 A for the AC and BC couples, respectively. These deviations account for the little differences occurring at the N terminus and in some of the residues of the L2 loop of the three molecules. In the structures of the A and C molecules, the L2 region between Phe242 and Glu244 is severely disordered with unclear electron density, which prevents the tracing of the residues. On the contrary in molecule B this loop is much better defined, resulting in a clear electron density and unambiguous tracing of the polypeptide chain. For this reason the discussion about the structural details of the inhibitor binding and of the active site structure will refer to molecule B. The molecular packing entails different intermolecular contacts. The intermolecular contacts between the three molecules in the asymmetric unit involve different parts of the subunits. Subunit A interacts with B through the b-turn hosting the non-catalytic zinc, which makes contacts with the extended loop over the catalytic B zinc site and the loop preceding a2. The contacts between the B and C molecules are more extended and involve the b-turns of both subunits as well as the loop between b1 and a1. The closer intermolecular interactions made by the L2 loop of the B molecule in the crystal packing appear to be responsible for its well ordered structure, while the L2 loops of the A and C molecules are involved in a lower number of contacts. A comment is due to the residues Lys165, which falls in generously allowed regions for all three molecules, and His178, which falls in generously allowed regions for molecules B and C and in a disallowed region for molecule A. In every case the side-chains and all backbone atoms are clearly identified in the electron density. The unusual conformation of these residues, within or close to the p-region of the Ramachandran plot, is due to their location on the L1 loop between b3 and b4.

Lys165 is close to the Zn2 ligand His167 and receives a strong H-bond from the Nd1 nitrogen of His167. His178 lies on the portion of the same loop where a calcium ion is bound and its conformation allows the three backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly175, Gly167, Ser179 to get closer in space in order to bind the Ca(II) ion. It is worth noting that the His178 conformation is approximately the same in all the three independent molecules, but in two cases (molecules B and C), it comes to establish an H-bond with the O3 oxygen of the NNGH inhibitor bound to the active site of the next molecule (A and B, respectively). Comparison with the available 3D structures of the other MMPs shows that these violations are characteristic of this family of proteins. Not surprisingly, in many MMPs a glycine is present at either or both positions (e.g. gelatinase A). Notable exceptions in terms of bulky residues for which the violation is more striking are Trp165 in MMP2 and His178 in the present case. The catalytic site The catalytic zinc ion (Zn1) is bound to the active site cleft between the b-sheet and loop L2. The zinc is five-coordinate, the ligands being the His217 N12, His221 N12, His227 N12 atoms and the two oxygen atoms of the chelating hydroxamate moiety of the NNGH inhibitor (Figure 2). The electron density of all the zinc ligands and of the inhibitor is well defined, as shown in Figure 3 for the inhibitor. The second zinc ion (Zn2) is bound in a tetrahedral geometry by His167 N12, Asp169 Od, His182 N12 and His195 Nd1. Of the three calcium ions, Ca1 is bound to Gly175, Gly177, Ser179 carbonyl oxygen atoms and to Asp174, Asp197, and Glu200 side-chains. Ca2 is bound to Gly189, Tyr191 carbonyl oxygen atoms, to Asp157, Asp195 side-chains and to one water molecule. One coordination position is open but no electron density is seen for a probable sixth water ligand. Ca3 is

sequences DGPGXX and PGPGXXGD (the bold characters indicate the calcium ligands). Inhibitor binding The present structure shows for the first time the binding mode of the NNGH inhibitor,29,30 which has never been described for MMPs. The interaction of the inhibitor with the active site is limited to the Zn1 ion and to the S10 subsite. In addition to the metal chelation, NNGH is held in the active site by H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Scheme 1 shows the NNGH interactions in the active site. The hydroxamic acid moiety chelates the zinc ion and is further involved in two H-bonds. The protonated oxygen atom (O4) in addition to the zinc coordination, donates a strong H-bond to the ° carboxylate O12 of Glu218 (2.5 A). In other hydroxamate-inhibited MMPs this distance ranges ° ° from 2.7 A to 3.1 A. On the contrary the carbonyl hydroxamate oxygen O5 is not involved in any H-bond while the hydroxamate NH has only a weak electrostatic interaction with the Ala181 carbonyl oxygen. The NNGH sulfonyl oxygen O2 makes important contributions to the inhibitor binding energy by establishing H-bonds with Leu180 N, and Ala181 N. Finally the sulfonyl oxygen O3 forms a hydrogen bond with His178 N12 from molecule C of the asymmetric unit (see before). This latter interaction is likely to occur only in the crystal and is made possible by the unusual conformation adopted by the His178 main-chain, as described above. Finally the phenolic methyl ether group of NNGH is deeply inserted in the S10 pocket, as also shown by Scheme 1. A water molecule is buried in the pocket and makes an H-bond with the methyl ether oxygen of the inhibitor. The external wall of the S10 pocket is

bound to Asp123 and Glu200 side-chains, while Asp199 shows an unusual behavior by chelating Ca3 with the carbonyl oxygen and one of the sidechain carboxylate oxygen atoms. Two water molecules complete the octahedral coordination. The residues that bind Ca1 and Ca2 are conserved among the MMPs and belong to glycine-rich

largely formed by the 240 ­ 247 loop (see below). The side-chains of Leu213 and Leu234, which are ° about 4.3 A apart and which make a hydrophobic cluster together with the side-chains of Phe248 and Phe212, form the bottom of the pocket. However, the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of these residues are present just on top of the Leu213 and Leu234 side-chains, and might serve as H-bond acceptors towards protonated inhibitors. Hence they can be considered as determinants for the design of new inhibitors. Similarly to other MMPs, the cavity is open on the back and can presumably host longer groups than the present metoxyphenyl moiety. Comparison between MMP-10 and MMP-3 Figure 4 shows the sequence alignment of MMP3 and MMP-10, with highlighted the catalytic domain and the stretch of residues present in the X-ray structure, and Figure 5 shows a stereo view of the Ca traces of MMP10 and MMP3 (1G49) superimposed by least-squares fitting of the Ca ° atoms (RMSD, 0.61 A). Overall, in the catalytic domain only 27 amino acid residues out of 177 are different in the two proteins, 22 of which are actually visible in the X-ray structure of the present construct. As many as ten of the latter are clustered in the stretch 178 ­207, and another five in the stretch 240­ 247. Therefore, these two regions are the ones where subtle structural differences are

more likely to occur. In the following, the structure of MMP-10 is compared with that of MMP-3, and particular attention is paid to the above two regions. There are as many as 26 Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries for the catalytic domain of MMP-3, both as such and complexed with active site-directed inhibitors, at different degrees of resolution. We first compare these structures to ascertain the degree of variability of the various regions of the protein from one experimental structure to another. Overall, all structures are of course very similar. The region 178­ 207 is very well conserved among all MMP-3s. Superposition of this region of the present MMP-10 structure with the whole family of MMP-3 structures shows that, despite the ten different side-chains, the overall structure is maintained. The proportion of hydrophobic versus hydrophilic residues is substantially conserved; the main discrepancy is a difference in charge for residue Glu204 of MMP-10, which is a Lys in MMP-3; in both cases this residue is on the surface of the molecule fully exposed to the solvent and is not involved in any interaction with other residues. The other differences in the alignment of the two proteins do not seem to be easily related to a possibly different chemical or structural behavior. Conversely, the only region of relatively large variability matches with the other stretch (loop 240­ 247) where amino acid differences between

MMP-3 and MMP-10 are concentrated. The variability of the loop 240 ­ 247 is apparent for the 11 structures that show this stretch sufficiently well resolved for at least one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Indeed, two other MMP-3 structures even show a gap of a few residues within the 240 ­247 region,31,32 indicating the presence of disorder in the crystalline state. This loop is particularly important, as it constitutes the outside wall of the S10 channel, which is the preferred target for the hydrophobic group of many active-sitedirected inhibitors of MMPs. In the large majority of cases (14 out of 19 molecules), this loop shows a fairly similar Ramachandran conformation, which is illustrated in Table 1. In the case of MMP-10, despite five residues out of eight being different, a Ramachandran conformation similar to that preferred by the majority of MMP-3 structures is adopted, but with the notable exception of Ser241, which moves from the B to the A region of the Ramachandran plane (Table 1). The fact that sometimes even within the same crystal structure different conformations of this loop are observed

(see 1D5J_a and b) suggests that this loop is intrinsically flexible and can assume several conformations having comparable energy, and the fact that this loop is not even resolved in two different crystal structures of MMP-331,32 as well as in molecules A and C of the present MMP-10 structure further confirms this intrinsic flexibility. It is important to recall that an inhibitor is present in several of the structures, and the different size and shape of its hydrophobic part may contribute to stabilize one conformation with respect to another. Ultimately, the flexibility of this loop may be one of the reasons for the limited success in designing inhibitors that are tailored to be specific for one or another MMP.

Conclusions
The crystal structure of another member of the human MMP family (MMP-10) has been deter° mined at 2.1 A resolution; although the structures of several other members of this family are already

known, some detailed features of MMP-10 can shed further light on the structure­function relationship of this class of proteins. The overall folding of MMP-10 clearly resembles those of the other MMPs and in particular that of MMP-3, according to their sequence homology, which is the highest among all MMPs. The main difference between MMP-3 and MMP-10 lies in a loop that involves residues 240­ 247. In one of the three molecules present in the asymmetric unit of MMP-10 (molecule B), possibly due to crystal packing contacts, this loop is stabilized in a more rigid conformation, as pointed out by a clear electron density in the corresponding region. As expected from the high identity in the catalytic domain, no apparent differences are seen between MMP-10 and MMP-3 in the groove that presumably hosts the substrate collagen. However, molecular modeling studies4 suggest that the hemopexin domain contributes to the definition of the substrate-binding region. The hemopexin domain shows a lower sequence identity (74%) between the two proteins and this might contribute in the modulation of the catalytic activity. Finally, this work shows for the first time the binding mode of NNGH, one of the most known commercial high affinity inhibitors of MMPs, which can be of help in the design of further variants of this scaffold.

acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), a weak inhibitor of MMPs, in order to avoid auto-proteolytic degradation. The sample for the crystallization was prepared by concentrating the refolded protein using an Amicon stirrer, fitted with a YM10 membrane in nitrogen atmosphere at 4 8C. Unfortunately the MMP-10 catalytic domain showed problems of solubility because, above the concentration of 0.3 mM, protein precipitation occurred. To solve this problem we have prepared the F170N mutant where a hydrophobic amino acid, present in the superficial area, was replaced with an hydrophilic one without altering the catalytic activity of the protein. A mutation at the same position was also successfully employed to increase the solubility of MMP-12.33 The mutant, produced with the same procedure as the wildtype protein, resulted three times more soluble than this one and so it was chosen as a model for the crystallization studies. We used the 1H ­ 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra of the 15N-enriched F170N mutant as a diagnostic tool to study the folding of the protein in the presence of either acetohydroxamic acid alone or together with NNGH29,30 (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc), a strong MMP inhibitor. In the second case the NMR experiments showed a better signal spreading, indicating that NNGH has an important role in stabilizing the protein. For this reason, when preparing the sample for the crystallization, we added the NNGH inhibitor to the refolded protein before its concentration. Crystallization, data collection and structure solution

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and characterization The cDNA encoding the sequence Phe99 ­ Gly263 of the MMP-10 catalytic domain was amplified from human fibroblast cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and it was cloned into the pET21 expression vector using Nde I and Xho I as restriction enzymes. The final expression product was bearing an additional methionine in the position 98. The recombinant vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3 and the bacteria were grown in 2 £ YT media. When a cell density corresponding to 0.6 A was reached, the expression of the protein was induced by adding 0.5 mM of IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside) and the incubation was continued for another three hours. The MMP-10 catalytic domain precipitated in the inclusion bodies and these were solubilized, after lysis of the cells, in a solution of 8 M urea and 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.5). The protein was purified on the anion exchange column Hitrap Q Sepharose HP (Pharmacia) with a buffer containing 6 M urea, 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.5) and carrying out an elution with a linear gradient of NaCl up to 0.35 M. After this procedure the yield of protein obtained was approximately of 3 mg/dm3. The purified protein was then refolded by using a multi-step dialysis against solutions containing 50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.3 M NaCl. During these steps the concentration of urea was gradually decreased from 4 M to 2 M and then completely removed from the buffer. Starting from the 2 M urea step, we added to the refolding buffer 0.2 M of

Crystals of human MMP10, already containing AHA and NNGH from the refolding process, grew at 20 8C from a 0.1 M Tris ­ HCl, 30% (w/v) PEG 6000, 200 mM AHA solution at pH 8.0 using the vapor diffusion technique. The final protein concentration was around 8 mg/ml. The crystals appeared in three to four weeks and they grew to an approximate size 0.2 mm £ 0.1 mm £ 0.1 mm. The reproducibility of the crystals is problematic and, despite the many attempts conducted over more than one year, we were able to obtain only four crystals of the complex. Furthermore, despite their size, the diffracting power of these crystals was very poor due to the low crystal order. On the laboratory rotating anode source we were able to observe only a ° few reflections at maximum resolution of about 9.0 A. Any attempt to improve the crystal quality failed so far. The availability of the extremely powerful synchrotron radiation source from the ESRF ID29 and ID14-1 beamlines (Grenoble, France) allowed us to collect a complete ° dataset to 2.1 A resolution. The data were measured at 100 K and the crystals used for data collection were cryo-cooled without any cryo-protectant treatment. The selected crystal had a mosaicity of 0.88 and diffracted to ° a maximum resolution of 2.0 A. The crystal space group ° ° ° is C2 with a ¼ 117:15 A, b ¼ 61:14 A, c ¼ 68:59 A, a ¼ g ¼ 90.008, b ¼ 108.678 and three molecules in the asymmetric unit. The low quality of the crystals is reflected in the quality of the obtained dataset. The data ° were weak and we have chosen to cut them to 2.1 A in order to achieve better completeness and I/s(I) ratio greater than 2.0 in the highest resolution bin (2.21­ ° 2.10 A) as well as an Rsym not larger than 10%. The data were processed using the program MOSFLM34and scaled using the program SCALA35 with the TAILS and SECONDARY corrections on (the latter restrained with

The structure was solved using the molecular replacement technique; the model used was that of a molecule of human MMP3 (PDB-ID 1G49) from where the inhibitor, all the water molecules and ions were omitted. The correct orientation and translation of the molecule within the crystallographic unit cell was determined with standard Patterson search techniques36,37as implemented in the program MOLREP.38,39 The program provided an evident solution for the positioning for the three molecules in the asymmetric unit with a correlation factor of 0.5. The Rcryst after molecular replacement was 0.35 and the Rfree was 0.40. The first seven to nine residues (depending on the molecule) present in the construct were not visible in the electron density maps and are not part of our model. The refinement was carried out using CNS40 and REFMAC5.41,42 CNS was used at the initial stages of the refinement where non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were used. At an R-factor of about 0.32 the NCS symmetry was released and REFMAC used for the final refinement cycles. In between the refinement cycles the model was subjected to manual rebuilding by using XtalView.43 The same program has been used to model the NNGH inhibitor. A total of 351 water molecules have been added by using the standard procedures within the ARP/wARP suite.44 The final Rcryst was 0.276 and the Rfree 0.298. The stereochemical quality of the refined models was assessed using the program PROCHECK.45 The Ramachandran plot relative to all three molecules is of good quality, considering the resolution of the structure
