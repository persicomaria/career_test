The projected structure of the vanadate-induced crystalline aggregates of Ca*+-ATPase molecules in isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes has been determined. The molecules form tubular crystals with an oblique surface lattice having cell dimensions a = 65.9 A, b = 114.4 A and y = 77.9". The space group is P2. The crystalline tubules are formed through lateral aggregation of chains made up of dimers of Ca ' + -ATPase molecules.

1. Introduction The Ca2+ transport ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum is an intrinsic membrane protein with a molecular weight of about 100,000 (Martonosi & Beeler, 1983). It is asymmetrically distributed in the phospholipid bilayer (Blasie et al., 1982; Saito et al., 1978) with much of its mass exposed on the cytoplasmic surface, where it can be visualized by negative staining in the form of 40 A diameter surface particles (Martonosi, 1968). The average density of the 40 A particles is about 20,000 per pm2 (Jilka et al., 1975). In freeze-fracture studies, the membrane-embedded regions of the protein were identified as 85 A diameter intramembrane particles that are more numerous on the cytoplasmic than on the luminal fracture face (Deamer & Baskin, 1969). The density of intramembrane particles is about 4000 to 5000 per pm2 (Jilka et aZ., 1975). The ratio of about four surface particles to one

intramembranous particle led to the suggestion that the ATPase may be present in the membrane as an oligomer (Jilka et al., 1975). Recent ultracentrifuge, fluorescence, electron spin resonance and enzyme kinetic data in detergentsolubilized and reconstituted Ca2+-ATPase systems are consistent with interactions between ATPase molecules (for a review, see Meller et al., 1982), but leave the nature of the interactions and their functional significance largely undefined. The crystallization of Ca `+-ATPase in scallop sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (Castellani & Hardwicke, 1983) as well as in rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles exposed to Xa,V04 (Dux & Martonosi? 1983a,b,c,d) opened a new approach to the analysis of this problem. The data reported here indicate that the Ca" -ATPase crystals induced by vanadate contain dimers as structural units that can polymerize into chains. The dimer chains further aggregate into right-handed helical membrane cylinders 600 to 800 A in diameter. A preliminary account of t'his work has been reported (Taylor et al., 1983). 2. Materials and Methods
of crystals

(a) Preparation

Crystalline arrays of Ca2+ -ATPase were prepared in isolated rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles by treatment with 5 mM-Na,VO, in the presence of 0.1 .RIKCl, 10 mivf-imidazole, 5 mM-Mgcl,, 05 mM-EGTA (pH 7.4) at 0°C for 1 to 2 days (Dux & Martonosi, 1983a). The total protein concentration was 1 to 2 mg/ml. (b) Electron microscopy Specimens for electron microscopy were prepared in a cold room at 4°C by applying a drop of crystalline suspension of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (1 mg protein/ml) to a 400-mesh copper electron microscope grid with a thin carbon support film. The grid was then washed with several drops of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution to remove residual crystallization medium. Once in many1 acetate, the vesicles are stable and t'he grids were therefore dried at room temperature. Electron micrographs for image analysis were taken at a magnification of 45,000 x on a Philips EM 301 electron microscope using minimal dose procedures as described by Unwin & Henderson (1975). Total specimen exposures required to scan at low magnification and record each micrograph were between 5 and 10 e/A2. The hand of the CaZt-ATPase surface lattice was determined by placing a drop of membrane suspension on a freshly cleaved mica surface and negatively staining it with loj, many1 acetate. The sample was then rotary shadowed with platinum/carbon at an angle of 12" and the shadowed surface backed with carbon for support. The resulting replica would not float off onto a clean water surface, but could be removed easily by floating the mica on a solution consisting of 25% (w/v) CrO,, lOO;, (v/v) H,SO,. The technique is an adaptation of a routine method for cleaning freeze-fracture replicas (Costello et al., 1982), except that the mica does not dissolve. The replica is recovered as a single piece floating on the acid solution and is washed free of acid without further treat,ment,. (c) Data analysis Using the optical diffraction pattern as the criterion, 7 micrographs were selected for computer analysis. The micrographs were defocused so that all observed reflections fell within the first ring of the contrast transfer function. assembled in this laboratory by W.

Longley and D. A. Kopf. The densitometer consists of a Zeiss microscope, a DEC LSI lljO2 computer, dual RX02 flexible disks, Matrox TV monitor and a video display terminal. Transparencies are traversed in x and y directions by computer-controlled stepping motors across a focused beam of light, which is then projected through the scanning aperture onto a silicon photodiode. The data, which are linear functions of optical density in the range 0 to 4, are first collected in computer memory as 256 gray levels, then transcribed onto flexible disks and later transferred to g-track magnetic tape. The system provides a 16 gray level display on an external TV monitor. Micrographs were scanned at a step size of 30 pm, which is equivalent to 7 A spacing with respect to the original object. The structure factor data obtained for each image were tested for the presence of a 2-fold rotation axis normal to the membrane plane by shifting the origin and comparing the phase of the reflection with the nearest value of either 0" or 180". Cross-correlations between different images were made using an origin refinement program originally written by S. D. Fuller and modified by K. A. Taylor at Duke. The latter correlations were determined both with and without assumptions about the presence of symmetry elements within the crystals. Structure factors and Fourier transforms of 256 x 256 point arrays were computed using of Molecular software originally written at the Medical Research Council Laboratory Biology, in Cambridge, England (courtesy of Dr Linda Amos). Density maps were calculated using the ROCKS crystallographic computing system. Calculations were carried out on the IBM 3081 computer at the Triangle Universities Computation Center, Research Triangle Park, N.C., and on a DEC LSI 11/23 computer equipped with a Hewlett-Packard HP7220T pen plotter.

3. Results
Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles containing crystalline arrays of Ca2+-ATPase display a variety of forms when examined on the electron microscope. These forms depend both upon the diameter of the tubules and the degree of flattening when dried in negative stain. For our image analysis, we chose crystalline tubules that were uniformly flattened to the carbon film and appeared coherent over an axial distance of 1800 to 2000 A. Three examples are shown in Figure 1. The vesicles covered with crystalline arrays frequently assume an elongated tubular shape. Rows of negatively stained particles are arranged in pairs forming ribbons that are oriented diagonally to the long axis of the flattened tubules at an angle of 57.6( k2.1)". Superposition of the images on the near and far sides of the tubules creates a diamond pattern. The double-stranded ribbons are separated from adjacent ribbons by wider bands of negative stain; as a result, the distance of separation between rows of particles alternates. The particles in neighboring ribbons are arranged in register, giving rise to rows oriented at approximately 20" to the cylinder axis. Along the edge of the flattened tubule, a broken line of densities is observed that is due to Ca2+-ATPase molecules seen in lateral projection. The appearance of these lateral projections is different from the particles seen on negatively stained native sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, which consist of 40 A diameter spheres connected by short stalks to the membrane surface. It remains to be established whether these differences are due to changes in the shape of Ca"`-ATPase molecule induced by Na,VO,. The widths of the flattened tubules used in the analysis ranged from 900 to 1100 A. This variation means that all crystals need not have the same helical

computed transforms of the seven tubules that were examined, indicated that in each case the "a" cell dimension from one side was consistently shorter ( -6%) than that from the other side. Such shrinkage is usually observed on the side that is not' stabilized by the carbon support film. This observation suggested that the "a" cell axis of the flattened tubules arose from left-handed helical components in the cylindrical tubules,

To confirm the hand of the crystalline t,ubules, we rotary shadowed specimens negatively stained on freshly cleaved mica sheets. Crystalline tubules for which the aqueous regions in the surface lattice are incompletely fiIled with negative stain can be expected to show the surface lattice of one side only (Fig. 3). Righthanded striations with approximately 100 a spacing are clearly observed; lefthanded striations approximately 60 a apart can also be seen when the micrographs are viewed obliquely. From this observation, we conclude that the

average cell constants, of the seven particles analyzed, are a = 65.9( k 1.0) A, b = I14.4( k2.3) A, y = 77.9( k2.9)" for the side nearest the carbon film and a = 61.9( kO.8) A, b = 114.2( +50) A, and y = 74.4( k2.4)" for the far side. These values differ from those reported previously (Taylor et al., 1983), which were obtained from membranes exposed to high electron dose. Based on these lattice constants, only two of the 17 possible two-sided plane groups, namely Pl and P2, can describe the distribution of matter within the crystalline tubule. In addition, the only possible symmetry element that could be present is a Z-fold rotation axis normal to the plane of the membrane. An origin search was carried out for each of the 11 data sets to test this prediction. The Fourier transforms contain contributions from both near and far sides, and it was common to have at least one coincident reflection pair in each transform. The origin search was carried out in two ways, using only non-coincident reflections. First, the 2-fold axis was tested by an internal search for the structure factors of each image. In the second method, cross-correlations were made between each image and a reference image to derive an average of all the 11 data sets. This latter approach took into account the possible S-fold symmetry and yielded somewhat higher phase residuals; these results are given in Table 1. The phase residuals strongly suggest the presence of a 2-fold axis and we conclude that the space group for the lattice is P2. By combining the structure factors for the 11 data sets, it was possible to assign unambiguously amplitudes and phases to 17 reflections. Averaging of the separate data sets was necessary because of the coincident reflections. Fortunately, due to the variation in helical and cell parameters, the same reflections were not always

coincident for each analyzed image. The averaged st,ructure factors are listed in Table 2. The averaged phases for all reflections are so close to either 0 or 180" that t'here is no ambiguity in assigning their nearest real value. A density map was calculated from the averaged set of structure factors using reflections that extend to 28 A resolution (Fig. 4). The projection shows pearshaped contours with a large dense domain and a small projecting lobe, which are assumed to represent structural domains of single ATPase molecules. Therefore, the antiparallel pairs of densities centered at the corners of the unit cell on 2fold rotation axes are probably Ca `+-ATPase dimers. Intermolecular connections between dimers give rise to dimer chains separated from adjacent chains by wider bands of negative stain. Weaker, discontinuous regions of negative stain separate the ATPase molecules within the dimer chains; the relative weakness of these stain densities supports a pattern of stain-excluding (protein) regions superimposed upon the negative stain. The maps calculated from the separately averaged near sides and from the separately averaged far sides are virtually identical to the map given in Figure 4. The effect of radiation damage on the structure of the crystals was assessed by comparing an averaged image of crystals obtained using conventional microscopic methods with a map calculated to the same resolution using the low dose data (Fig. 5). The high electron dose map was determined by combining near and far side data obtained from micrographs of four crystalline tubules. The accumulated electron exposure for each of these micrographs is considerably greater than

4. Discussion
Crystalline arrays of Ca2+ -ATPase molecules develop in isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles after treatment with Na,VO,. The tubular crystalline arrays consist of a right-handed helical surface lattice of ribbons of Ca2' -ATPase dimers. The flattened crystalline tubules have a variety of widths ranging from 800 to 1200 a and have a 2-fold rotation axis normal to the axis of the cylinder. The unit cell constants derived by Fourier analysis are a = 66 8, b = 114 A and y = 78". Similar lattice constants were reported recently by Aebi and his co-workers (Buhle et al., 1983; Aebi et al., 1983). Crystalline arrays of Cazt-ATPase molecules have been observed also in molluscan muscle microsomes in the absence of Na,VO, (Castellani & Hardwicke, 1983). The unit cell c0nstant.s are different in

the molluscan system from those observed here for the rabbit. In addition: the relationship bet,ween the units of the dimer appear also to be different,. Nevertheless, their projected density map is consistent with our interpretation of the crystal structure in terms of ribbons of dimers separated by deeper troughs of negative stain. The differences in the shape of the ATPase molecules in the density maps of molluscan as compared with rabbit muscle mierosomes might plausibly be explained by differences in electron dose. The differences in cell constant remain to be explained. The density map shows pairs of Ca 2+-ATPase molecules in two types of arrangements related by 2-fold rotation axes. In the type A arrangement, the pair of ATPase molecules is related by the S-fold axis a,t the corners of the unit cell as drawn in Figure 4 (0,O). The type B relationship exists between the pairs of ATPase molecules related by the 2-fold at the midpoint of the b axis (O,b/Z). Although the centers of the protein masses are closer in the type R than in the type A arrangement: the pairs of ATPase molecules in t'ype B a.re separated by a deep trough of negative stain, while in type A there is much less stain penetration between the two ATPase molecules. This difference is most likely due to the superposit'ion of some stain-excluding material, probably protein between the type A pairs. The lesser degree of stain penetration in the type A arrangement implies a more significant contact between the ATPa,se pair. Therefore, we conclude that the t'ype A relationship represents ATPase dimers as st,ructural units. The ATPase dimers are linked to form double-stranded ribbons, which are themselves separate struct.ural entities. Individual dimer ribbons can be visualized

under tw-o different conditions. They appear frequently on t.he surface of spherical vesicles during early phases of the crystallization process, and later associate laterally to form the extended lattice with the appearance of cylindrical profiles (Dux & Martonosi, 1983cc). Separate dimer ribbons also arise after disruption of crystalline arrays by osmotic lysis of the vesicles or as a result of mechanical disruption during negative staining (Dux & Martonosi, 1983c). These observations imply that the bonds that link the type A pairs into dimers and the dimers into chains are stronger than the bonds that establish contact between the type B pairs and link the dimer chains into register to form the extended lattice. The existence of oligomeric forms of the Ca2+-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum was proposed some years ago, based on t.he relative number of intramembranous 85 A particles and the number of 40 A surface particles seen in negatively stained images of isolated membranes (Jilka et al., 1975). Further support for the existence of ATPase oligomers came from physical and enzyme kinetic studies on detergent-solubilized Ca `+-ATPase preparations (Moller et al., 1982), from fluorescence energy transfer measurements (Vanderkooi et al., 1977), and from measurements of excimer fluorescence of pyrenemaleimide covalently bound to the Ca 2+- L 4TPase (Ludi & Hasselbach, 1983). Target inactivation experiments (Vegh et al., 1968; Maurer et al., 1983) and stereological analysis of freeze-fracture images of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes (Napolitano et al., 1983) suggest Ca 2+-ATPase dimers as the predominant species in the native membrane. Mild non-ionic detergents (Triton X-100) disrupt both the extended lattice and the dimer ribbons at concentrations that do not solubilize sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (Dux & Martonosi, 1983c) and do not influence the excimer fluorescence of pyrenemaleimide covalently bound to the Ca2+-ATPase (Kracke & Martonosi, unpublished results). As the excimer fluorescence indicates the existence of ATPase oligomers, these observations imply that the bonds that stabilize dimers are less sensitive to detergents than the bonds involved in the formation of dimer chains, and their interaction with each other. Such results provide firm evidence for an oligomeric structure of Ca'+-ATPase in the native sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane but' do not define its stoichiometry. The crystallographic data presented in this report establish the dimer as the structural form of the enzyme in the crystal and make it very likely that dimers are also the predominant, species in the Ca2+-ATPase equilibrium in the native membrane. We would expect that higher order aggregates (trimers or tetramers) of identical molecules in the same conformation would most likely crystallize in trigonal or tetragonal lattices, for which there is no indication. Since during Ca2 ' transport, cyclic changes in the conformation of the Ca"-ATPase occur, in principle, higher order aggregates could occur, but these are likely to be multimers of dimers with a lifetime of the order of t'he turnover time of the Ca2+ATPase, i.e. about 100 milliseconds. The question arises as to why crystalline arrays of Ca2+-ATPase have not been observed in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes in &IO or in vitro under physiological conditions. The formation of ordered arrays of Ca2+-ATPase may require that all molecules assume the same conformation (Dux & Martonosi,
