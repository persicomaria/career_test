Institute of Veterinary Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of ¨ Zurich-Irchel Winterthurerstrasse 190 ¨ CH-8057, Zurich, Switzerland DNA damage leads to activation of several mechanisms such as DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints. It is evident that these different cellular mechanisms have to be finely co-ordinated. Growing evidence suggests that the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 cell-cycle checkpoint complex (9-1-1 complex), which is recruited to DNA lesion upon DNA damage, plays a major role in DNA repair. This complex has been shown to interact with and stimulate several proteins involved in long-patch base excision repair. On the other hand, the well-characterised DNA clamp-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) also interacts with and stimulates several of these factors. In this work, we compared the effects of the 9-1-1 complex and PCNA on flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1). Our data suggest that PCNA and the 9-1-1 complex can independently bind to and activate Fen1. Finally, acetylation of Fen1 by p300-HAT abolished the stimulatory effect of the 9-1-1 complex but not that of PCNA, suggesting a possible mechanism of regulation of this important repair pathway.

Introduction
It was estimated that a mammalian genome undergoes about 100,000 modifications per day.1 Some of these DNA base damages that can be generated by ionizing radiation, simple alkylating agents, as well as endogenous hydrolytic and oxidative processes are corrected by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Two BER sub-pathways have been characterised using in vitro and in vivo methods, and have been classified according to the length of the repair patch as either short-patch BER (SP-BER, one nucleotide) or long-patch BER (LP-BER; more than one nucleotide).2 The first step in both BER sub-pathways is carried

out by DNA glycosylases (examples being OGG1, NTH1, MYH), which are specific for a particular type of base damage or, more commonly, a group of related types. These enzymes remove the damaged base, leaving a potentially mutagenic apurinic/ apyrimidinic (AP) site. The resulting abasic site is then recognized by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (called APE1 or HAP1), which incises the damaged strand, leaving a single-nucleotide gap with 3 0 -OH and 5 0 -deoxyribose phosphate (5 0 -dRP) groups flanking the nucleotide gap. Further repair can be accomplished via two pathways that involve different subsets of enzymes and result in replacement of one (SP-BER pathway) or from two to ten (LP-BER pathway) nucleotides. In the LP-BER pathway, the collaboration of DNA polymerase (pol) d/3, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication factor C (RF-C) and flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) can displace the 3 0 nick and synthesize up to ten nucleotides. The flap is cut by Fen1 and the final nick is sealed by DNA ligase I.3­5 pol d/3 can participate in this reaction,6­8 and DNA ligase I is likely the patch size mediator in LP-BER.9 Moreover, the LP-BER pathway can be carried out by pol b, Fen1

Regulation of Fen1 by the 9-1-1 Complex and PCNA

981 complex (the 9-1-1 complex) that exhibits structural similarity with the homotrimeric clamp formed by PCNA,28­30 and was shown to play a major role in sensing DNA damage.27,31­36 Although the link between checkpoint engagement and the recruitment to DNA lesions of repair machinery is far from being understood, recent studies performed in yeast have shown interaction or co-localisation of the alternative checkpoint clamp 9-1-1 complex with proteins involved in various DNA-repair processes upon DNA damage.37­39 Moreover, recent investigations showed a possible link between the human 9-1-1 complex and the BER pathway (Table 1). First, we reported a physical and functional interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with the main BER pol, pol b40 and functional analysis revealed that the 9-1-1 complex had a specific stimulatory effect on pol b activity. The pol b stimulation resulted from an increase in its affinity for the primer-template. The interaction with the 9-1-1 complex stimulated DNA strand displacement synthesis by pol b, an activity required for LPBER, raising the possibility that the 9-1-1 complex might attract pol b to DNA-damage sites, thus connecting directly checkpoints and DNA repair. Very recently, we showed that the 9-1-1 complex interacts with and stimulates another protein involved in LP-BER, DNA ligase I.41 In addition, similar physical and functional interactions with the 9-1-1 complex were identified for human Fen142 and for the MutY homolog of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.43 These results suggested that the 9-1-1 complex could act as a recruiting platform for the different factors involved in LP-BER. On the other hand, the other DNA clamp PCNA can interact with more than 25 cellular proteins. 36,44 Among them are also components of the LP-BER machinery, including DNA glycosylase,45,46 HAP1,47,48 pol b,49 Fen115 and DNA ligase I50 (Table 1). Interestingly, the interaction of BER proteins with PCNA resulted in most of the cases in a functional stimulation. For these reasons, the parallel between PCNA and the 9-1-1 complex with respect to their interaction with the LP-BER machinery is striking. The recent findings concerning the 9-1-1 complex now raise the question of how the two DNA clamps alternatively regulate the action of the BER proteins.

and DNA ligase I. In this case, pol b and Fen1 cooperate within a so-called hit and run mechanism, where the two enzymes act successively.10 The Fen1 endonuclease is a major player in BER, and it has an essential role in DNA replication, where it participates in the removal of initiator nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) during Okazaki fragment processing.11,12 Fen1 endonuclease was shown to be modulated by protein­protein interactions. It forms a stable complex with PCNA both in vivo and in vitro via a PCNA interaction motif located near its basic C terminus,13­17 resulting in a stimulation of Fen1 activity in vitro.14,18­20 Moreover, Fen1 is a target for two post-translational modifications in vivo: acetylation21,22 and phosphorylation.23 Fen1 has been shown to be modified by the histone acetyl transferase activity of p300 in vitro at its C terminus, resulting in an inhibition of its endo- and exonuclease activities, without affecting its stimulation by PCNA.21,22 Additionally, UV treatment of cells results in a significant increase of Fen1 acetylation, suggesting an implication of this post-translational modification in DNA damage response. On the other hand, cyclindependent kinase 1-cyclin A can interact with and phosphorylate Fen1 in vivo and in vitro, resulting in a reduction of its endo- and exonuclease activities.23 Moreover, phosphorylation of Fen1 was shown to inhibit its stimulation by PCNA. Hence, through their ability to modulate Fen1 activity, these two posttranslational modifications probably play important regulatory roles in its function in vivo. DNA repair is coordinated with cell-cycle progression24,25 and with DNA-damage checkpoints.26 DNA-damage checkpoint pathways are activated at specific points during the cell cycle when the integrity of DNA is examined before progression to the next cell-cycle phase is allowed. After their activation, highly ordered mechanisms are induced by proteins that function as signal sensors, transducers and effectors, which lead to either delay or arrest of cell-cycle progression, induction of DNA-repair genes or apoptosis.27 Some of these factors, such as ataxia telangectasia mutated protein (ATM), ATM-related protein (ATR), ATR interacting protein (ATRIP), Rad17, Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1, are thought to be involved in triggering DNA repair processes. Among those, the three human proteins Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 form a heterotrimeric

with and regulate the function of Fen1. Finally, we found that acetylation of Fen1 by p300-HAT regulates differentially the effect of the 9-1-1 complex and PCNA on Fen1 activity.

Results
The 9-1-1 complex interacts physically with Fen1 and stimulates its endonuclease activity The 9-1-1 complex has been shown to interact with several LP-BER factors in vitro (Table 1) and to co-immunoprecipitate with Fen1 from cellular extracts.42 Our initial aim was to determine whether the 9-1-1 complex and Fen1 interact directly in vitro. To address this question, we first performed Hispull-down experiments with purified 9-1-1 complex in the presence of either His-Fen1 bound to nickel beads or nickel beads alone (Figure 1(a), upper panel). Western blot analysis against Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 revealed a specific co-precipitation of the complex with His-tagged Fen1 but not with nickel beads used as a control. In addition, we used PCNA as a positive control (Figure 1(a), lower panel) and showed that, as expected, PCNA interacted with Fen1 under these conditions. As a second step, we tested which of the monomers were involved directly in this interaction. This was done by Hispull-down after incubation of His-Fen1 with Sf21 cell extracts over-expressing Rad1, Hus1 or Rad9 separately (Figure 1(b)). Western blot analysis revealed a specific interaction of Rad1, Hus1 and Rad9 with Fen1, which was further confirmed in a far-Western blot experiment (data not shown). These results demonstrate for the first time that the 9-1-1 complex and Fen1 interact directly in vitro, and that this interaction appears to be mediated by each of the three monomers, as it is the case for pol b40 and the fission yeast MutY homolog.43 We next tested whether Fen1 interaction with the 9-1-1 complex resulted in a stimulation of its cleavage activity on a 20 nt single-flap DNA substrate (Figure 1(c)). As shown in Figure 1(c), left panel, addition of increasing amounts of 9-1-1 complex led to a dose-dependent stimulation of Fen1 activity. A 12-fold stimulation was observed in the presence of a 20-fold excess of 9-1-1 complex over Fen1, which is in agreement with the data presented by Wang et al.42 In addition, as shown in Figure 1(c), right panel, we demonstrated that the 9-1-1 complex used in our assays did not contain any intrinsic flap endonuclease activity. Together, these data suggest a specific stimulation of Fen1 by the 9-1-1 complex. The C terminus of Fen1 is involved in the interaction and stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex Since we showed that both PCNA and the 9-1-1 complex interact with Fen1, we next analysed if both DNA clamps shared a common interaction site on Fen1, which is known to interact with PCNA through a conserved motif near its C terminus,

His-pull-down experiments were performed in the presence of either HisFen1 (8 mg) or nickel beads alone and purified 9-1-1 complex (1.7 mg) or PCNA (0.46 mg) as a positive control. The presence of co-precipitated proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. (b) Physical interaction of the 9-1-1 complex subunits with Fen1. Hispull-down experiments were performed in the presence of either His-Fen1 (8 mg) or nickel beads alone and Sf21 cell lysates (15 mg) expressing Rad1, Hus1 or Rad9 separately. The presence of co-precipitated proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. (c) Stimulation of Fen1 flap endonuclease activity by the 9-1-1 complex. Fen1 endonuclease activity was determined as described in Materials and Methods in the absence or in the presence of increasing amounts of 9-1-1 complex (as indicated). Where indicated, 5 fmol of Fen1 was used. The DNA substrate is shown at the top of the Figure, substrate and product size (in nt) are indicated at the left of the Figure. The amount of 21mer product (in %) is indicated at the bottom of the Figure.

983 did not stimulate Fen1 DP but stimulated Fen1 DC (data not shown). As expected, the Fen1 DP and Fen1 wt endonuclease activity were stimulated to a similar extent by the 9-1-1 complex (compare Figure 2(c), lanes 2­7 and 8­13), confirming that the PCNA interaction motif is not required for stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex. Surprisingly, although its interaction with the Fen1 DC mutant was only partially impaired, the 9-1-1 complex was completely unable to stimulate the endonuclease activity of the Fen1 DC mutant (Figure 2(c), lanes 15­20), even when greater amounts of either 9-1-1 complex or Fen1 DC were used (data not shown). Therefore, the last C-terminal 21 amino acid residues of Fen1 are important for the interaction with the 9-1-1 complex, but absolutely necessary for its stimulation (Figure 2, compare data in (b) and (c)). However, Fen1 stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex may be due either to an increased processive cleavage or to a faster distributive rate of the nuclease. In this case, the observed lack of stimulation may be explained by

QxxLxxFF.15 To analyse if the interaction with the 9-1-1 complex was also mediated by this region, His-pull-down experiments with a Fen1 mutant lacking the PCNA interaction motif, Fen1 DP, were performed (see Figure 2(a) for description of Fen1 mutants).17 As shown in Figure 2(b), the Fen1 DP mutant interacted with the 9-1-1 complex to the same extent as wild-type (wt) Fen1 (compare lanes 3 and 5). A Fen1 deletion mutant lacking the last 21 C-terminal amino acid residues (360­380) called Fen1 DC, however, showed a significantly reduced interaction with the 9-1-1 complex, indicating that the C terminus of Fen1 might be important for this interaction. These results suggested that the interaction site for the 9-1-1 complex on Fen1 is different from the PCNA interaction motif and likely involves the last 21 amino acid residues of Fen1, although other regions of Fen1 might be involved. Next, we tested whether the previously observed stimulation of Fen1 endonuclease activity by PCNA and the 9-1-1 complex was impaired in the Fen1 deletion mutants. As shown previously,17 PCNA

The endonuclease activity of Fen1 wt (5 fmol, lanes 2­7), Fen1 DP (5 fmol, lanes 8­13) and Fen1 DC (5 fmol, lanes 15­20) was determined in the absence (lanes 2, 8 and 15) or in the presence of increasing amounts of the 9-1-1 complex (lanes 3, 9 and 16, 20 fmol of 9-1-1 complex; lanes 4, 10 and 17, 40 fmol of 9-1-1 complex; lanes 5, 11 and 18, 60 fmol of 9-1-1 complex, lanes 6, 12 and 19, 80 fmol of 9-1-1 complex, lanes 7, 13 and 20, 100 fmol of 9-1-1 complex).

Regulation of Fen1 by the 9-1-1 Complex and PCNA

the fact that, due to a less stable interaction, the bound 9-1-1 complex does not remain associated with Fen1 throughout a full catalytic cycle of Fen1. Addition of both DNA clamps PCNA and 9-1-1 complex to Fen1 increases its cleavage efficiency From these results, an important question arose; namely, to determine how the two DNA clamps can interact with Fen1. If the binding sites for PCNA and the 9-1-1 complex on Fen1 are different, one would not expect that the interaction of one clamp influences the interaction of the other with Fen1. Indeed, pull-down experiments with the 9-1-1 complex and PCNA showed that addition of increasing amounts of PCNA led to an increase in PCNA binding, but had no effect on the interaction of Fen1 with the 9-1-1 complex (Figure 3(a), compare lane 4 with lanes 7 and 8). Similarly, increasing the amount of the 9-1-1 complex showed no effect on the interaction with PCNA, enhancing only the 9-1-1 complex interaction (Figure 3(a), compare lane 4 with lanes 5 and 6). Addition of bovine serum albumin as a control showed no effect on these two interactions (data not shown). Therefore, the presence of one clamp neither stimulated nor inhibited the binding of the other clamp to Fen1. This result led us to test how Fen1 could be stimulated by the simultaneous addition of both DNA clamps. Fen1 was incubated first with a constant amount of PCNA in the presence of the flap DNA substrate. Then, increasing amounts of the 9-1-1 complex were added and, after a second incubation, the reactions were started by the addition of MgCl2. The results in Figure 3(b) and (c) show that Fen1 wt could be stimulated simultaneously by the 9-1-1 complex and PCNA, reaching an increased cleavage efficiency when compared to the stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex alone (Figure 3(b), compare lanes 3­6 with lanes 7­10). Furthermore, quantification of three independent experiments showed that stimulation of Fen1 following addition of the 9-1-1 complex was proportional in the absence and in the presence of PCNA (Figure 3(c)), thus suggesting that PCNA has neither a synergistic nor an inhibitory effect on Fen1 stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex. Acetylation of Fen1 prevents stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex but not by PCNA In Figure 2(b) and (c), we show that the C-terminal part of Fen1 is important for the interaction with the 9-1-1 complex. This region is involved in DNA binding and contains several lysine residues.17 Considering that the C terminus of Fen1 is a target for acetylation by p300,21 we

Control His-pull-down experiments were performed separately in the presence of His-Fen1 (8 mg) and 9-1-1 complex (1.7 mg, lane 1) or PCNA (0.46 mg, lane 2). Lanes 4 to 8 show pull-down experiments where PCNA and the 9-1-1 complex were added simultaneously to His-Fen1 bound to Ni beads. Lanes 4 to 6, His-pull-down experiments performed in the presence of His- Fen1 (8 mg), a fixed amount of PCNA (0.46 mg) and increasing amounts of 9-1-1 complex (lane 4, 1.7 mg; lane 5, 3.4 mg; lane 6, 6.8 mg). Lanes 4, 7 and 8, His-pull-down experiments were performed in the presence of HisFen1 (8 mg), a fixed amount of 9-1-1 complex (1.7 mg) and increasing amounts of PCNA (lane 4, 0.46 mg; lane 7, 0.92 mg; lane 8, 1.84 mg). The presence of co-precipitated proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. (b) Stimulation of Fen1 cleavage by simultaneous addition of 9-1-1 complex and PCNA. The endonuclease activity of Fen1 wt (3.75 fmol, lanes 1­10) was determined on the same flap DNA substrate as in Figure 1. After preincubation for 10 min on ice with 150 fmol of PCNA (lanes 2­6), increasing amounts of the 9-1-1 complex were added (lanes 3 and 7, 20 fmol of 9-1-1 complex; lanes 4 and 8, 40 fmol of 9-1-1 complex; lanes 5 and 9, 60 fmol of 9-1-1 complex and lanes 6 and 10, 100 fmol of 9-1-1 complex). After a second incubation for 15 min on ice, the reactions were started by the addition of MgCl2. Lane 1 corresponds to the activity of Fen1 wt alone.

investigated whether acetylation of Fen1 could affect its stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex. For this purpose, we performed acetylation of Fen1 as described by Hasan et al.21 and used the acetylated Fen1 in flap endonuclease assays with either the 9-1-1 complex or PCNA (Figure 4(b)). In each set of experiments, we used in parallel acetylated Fen1 and control Fen1, which was subjected to the same treatment but in the absence of the acetyl donor, acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA; see Materials and Methods). The amounts of acetylated and control Fen1 after treatment were determined in a Bradford assay (data not shown), and a fraction of each sample was subsequently analysed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue, followed by autoradiography. As shown in Figure 4(a), the amounts of Fen1 present in both samples were similar, and the acetylation (incorporation of [14C]acetyl group) was confirmed by autoradiography showing a signal only for acetylated Fen1. His-pull-down experiments using acetylated Fen1 performed as in Figure 1(a) showed that it was still able to interact with the 9-1-1 complex (data not shown). When the 9-1-1 complex was used in a Fen1 endonuclease assay with non-acetylated Fen1, the stimulatory effect of the 9-1-1 complex could still be clearly detected (Figure 4(b), lanes 6­10), although the stimulation was weaker than that usually observed with untreated Fen1 (see Figure 1). Most interestingly, the acetylated Fen1 apparently lost its ability to be stimulated by the 9-1-1 complex (Figure 4(b), lanes 1­5). This effect is not due to the presence of AcCoA, since the latter did not show any effect on Fen1 endonuclease activity (data not shown).21 Stimulation by PCNA was used as a positive control (Figure 4(b), lanes 11­20) and showed that both acetylated and non-acetylated Fen1 retained the ability to be stimulated by PCNA, an observation made earlier in our laboratory.21 A quantitative analysis of the results of three independent experiments (Figure 4(c)) confirmed the loss of stimulation of the acetylated Fen1 by the 9-1-1 complex, whereas addition of 9-1-1 complex to nonacetylated Fen1 resulted in a threefold stimulation. The fact that the stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex is lower than previously observed (Figure 1), was likely due to an alteration of Fen1 during the incubation step of the acetylation process. Nevertheless, the difference between acetylated and nonacetylated Fen1 was significant. From these data, we concluded that acetylated Fen1 lost its capacity to be stimulated by the 9-1-1 complex.

Discussion
The 9-1-1 complex was first supposed to play a role in sensing and transducing DNA damage within checkpoint pathways.27 However, growing evidence suggested that it may play a more direct role in various DNA-repair processes such as nucleotide excision repair (NER),39 double-strand break repair,37 or translesion DNA synthesis.37­39 In

The left panel shows a Coomassie brilliant blue-stained SDS/polyacrylamide gel of Fen1 (3 mg) after the acetylation assay in the absence (control Fen1) or in the presence of [14C]AcCoA (Fen1 Ac), respectively. The right panel shows the autoradiography of the same gel. (b) The effect of acetylation on 9-1-1 complex and PCNA stimulation. Fen1 endonuclease assay with acetylated or control Fen1 (6 fmol) in the presence of the 9-1-1 complex or PCNA using the same flap DNA substrate as in Figure 1 was performed as outlined in Materials and Methods. Increasing amounts of the 9-1-1 complex (lanes 2 and 7, 40 fmol; lanes 3 and 8, 70 fmol; lanes 4 and 9, 100 fmol and lanes 5 and 10, 150 fmol) or of PCNA (lanes 12 and 17, 100 fmol; lanes 13 and 18, 200 fmol; lanes 14 and 19, 300 fmol and lanes 15 and 20, 400 fmol) were tested with acetylated or control Fen1. Substrate and product size (in nt) are indicated at the left of the Figure (c) Quantification of the effect of acetylation on 9-1-1 complex and PCNA stimulation. The graphs show the stimulation of acetylated (open circle) or control (filled square) Fen1 by the 9-1-1 complex (left panel) or PCNA (right panel). The values represent the mean of three independent experiments GSEM. The stimulation was calculated as the quotient between the activity in the absence and in the presence of the indicated amounts of PCNA or the 9-1-1 complex.

986 our laboratory, we focused on the role of the 9-1-1 complex in BER and showed that the 9-1-1 complex interacts with and stimulates pol b40 and DNA ligase I.41 Although the 9-1-1 complex is not as well characterised as PCNA, it is interesting to notice that the two clamps have some interacting partners in common, and that for some of them they exert a similar effect on their activities (Table 1). In this work, we confirmed that the 9-1-1 complex stimulates Fen1 activity, and we further analysed how the two proteins interact (Figures 1 and 2). Contrary to what one may expect, considering the structural similarity with PCNA, we showed that the 9-1-1 complex does not interact with Fen1 through its PCNA interaction motif (PIP).15 This finding suggests that, although the two clamps have some common interacting partners, their interaction might be different. In this context, we showed very recently that DNA ligase I, another LP-BER protein that also interacts with PCNA and the 9-1-1 complex, can be stimulated by the 9-1-1 complex even in the presence of PCNA.41 In the case of Fen1, we showed that the presence of both clamps did not interfere with the binding or with the stimulatory effect of either of them (Figure 3). This finding, taken together with the fact that PCNA and the 9-1-1 complex colocalize upon DNA damage, suggest that the two DNA clamps could act simultaneously in some steps of the BER process. Since recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex onto chromatin upon DNA damage has been shown to be an early event of checkpoint activation,51 one may propose that upon binding to the lesion, the 9-1-1 complex may recruit and stimulate the BER proteins where DNA repair should occur. Subsequently the presence of PCNA could allow an increased efficiency of the repair process via the stimulation of some of the enzymatic activities involved. In addition, we showed that, as it was found for pol b40 and the MutY homolog glycosylase,43 the three subunits of the 9-1-1 complex are able to interact with Fen1 (Figure 1(b)). At a first glance, this finding may be surprising. However, this result does not necessarily imply that this is also the case when the three subunits are assembled in a ringshaped complex, as this may provide an additional regulation for the binding of each protein interactor. Moreover, one should keep in mind that this situation is very similar to that of PCNA, where each of the three identical subunits can potentially interact with each protein partner. It will therefore be important to determine in detail, as it was done for PCNA,14,52,53 the interaction sites of the different 9-1-1 complex partners, and the possible regulation of their simultaneous or sequential interactions with the heterotrimeric ring. Finally, the heterotrimeric PCNA from Sulfolobus solfataricus was shown to interact simultaneously with the major B-type polymerase (polB1), Fen1 and DNA ligase of S. solfataricus.54 In this case, distinct PCNA subunits contact the DNA polymerase, DNA ligase, or Fen1, allowing a sequential action of these proteins during Okazaki fragment maturation. Similarly,

Regulation of Fen1 by the 9-1-1 Complex and PCNA

one may suppose that the interaction of the different BER proteins with the heterotrimeric ring formed by the 9-1-1 complex occurs and is regulated at the sites of BER in a similar way. In addition, we showed that the C-terminal part of Fen1 is involved in the interaction with the 9-1-1 complex and that this region is essential for 9-1-1 complex-mediated Fen1 stimulation (Figure 2). This finding is interesting from the evolutionary point of view, considering that the C-terminal part of Fen1 is absent from Archaea, and that these organisms do not express any rad-family checkpoint proteins.55 These two facts may suggest a parallel evolution of these systems in eukaryotic cells. Additionally, the C-terminal part of Fen1 is the target of acetylation by the acetyltransferase p300.21 We showed that acetylated Fen1 could not be stimulated anymore by the 9-1-1 complex, whereas it was still stimulated by PCNA (Figure 4). Another post-translational modification, phosphorylation of Fen1 has been shown to abrogate its stimulation by PCNA.23 Taken together, these data point to a possible differential regulation of the effect of the 9-1-1 complex and PCNA on Fen1 via modification of its post-translational status. Moreover, acetylation could play a role in regulation of DNA repair mechanisms upon different DNA lesions. Previous studies documented that Fen1 acetylation is increased upon UV damage that is known to activate the NER pathway.21 As Fen1 is not involved in this repair pathway, the absence of stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex on acetylated Fen1 may be a regulatory feature that may prevent the activation of Fen1 by the 9-1-1 complex under these conditions. Furthermore, p300 was shown to acetylate pol b, resulting in a decrease of its dRP-lyase activity, which is crucial for BER.56 Consistent with these data, it has been shown recently that the glycosylase NEIL2 is a target for acetylation by p300, resulting in a total inactivation of its activity.57 Therefore, acetylation of BER components may be a common down-regulating mechanism when other repair pathways are required in a cell.

on ice. After addition of the 9-1-1 complex, samples were further incubated 15 min on ice and the reactions were started as described above. Acetylation assays A sample of purified Fen1 (10 mg) was acetylated with glutathione Sepharose bound GST-p300-HAT (1 mg) for 30 min at 30 8C in 30 ml of HAT-buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM sodium butyrate) and 50 mM [14C] AcCoA (47 mCi/mmol) as described.21 Acetylated Fen1 was used for endonuclease assays after determination of protein concentration by Bradford assay, and for SDSPAGE analysis followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue and autoradiography.

and mutants described in Figure 2(a) were expressed in E. coli and purified as described.17,59 Untagged or Histagged 9-1-1 complexes were respectively obtained by coexpressing in Sf21 cells the three baculoviruses encoding the recombinant hRad1, hRad9 and hHus1 or recombinant hRad1, hRad9 and His-hHus. The 9-1-1 complex was purified as described.40 Singly infected Sf21 cell extracts were obtained by expression of each of the recombinant proteins followed by extraction according to Shiomi et al.29 GST, GST-tagged fragment number 4 (#4) (amino acid residues 1459­1892) of p300 (GST-p300 #4) and the GSTtagged HAT domain (amino acid residues 1197­1674) of p300 (GST-p300 HAT) were expressed in E. coli TG1 strain as described.21 Antibodies The anti-Hus1 and anti-Rad9 antibodies described by Toueille et al.40 were a gift from R. Freire (Tenerife, Spain). The goat anti-Rad1 antibody (N18), as well as the rabbit anti-GST (Z-5) and the mouse anti-PCNA (PC10) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Pull-down assays with His6-Fen1 Amounts of wild-type or deletion mutants of His-Fen1 resulting in equal binding to Ni2C beads were determined. After binding of the His-tagged proteins to the beads, they were subsequently treated with 10 mg of Sf21 cell extract to prevent unspecific binding. The purified protein or cell extracts indicated in the Figure legends were subsequently added and incubated for 2 h at 4 8C in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) NP40. The beads were then washed five times with the same buffer, containing 10 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer and resolved on an SDS/12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. The co-precipitated proteins were subsequently analyzed by Western blot using the corresponding antibodies according to established methods. Flap endonuclease assays Assay conditions and flap substrate preparation were as described.22 The flap substrate presented in Figure 1(c) consisted of three oligonucleotides. The sequences are as follows: 39-mer, 5 0 -GTCATGATAGATCTGATCGCTCGAAT TCCTGCAGCCCGG-3 0 ; 30-mer, 5 0 -TCGAGGTCGA CGGTATCGATAAGCTTGATA-3 0 and 49-mer, 5 0 CCGGGCTGCAGGAATTCGATATCAAGCTTATCGA TACCGTCGACCTCGA-3 0 . Unannealed nucleotides (nt) are shown in bold. Reactions were performed in a final volume of 12.5 ml containing 40 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 200 mg/ml of BSA and 50 fmol of DNA substrate. After addition of wt or mutant Fen1 and 9-1-1 complex, reactions were incubated for 15 min on ice. Cleavage was started by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubation at 37 8C for 4 min. Reactions were stopped with 2.5!stop buffer (95% (v/v) formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) each bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). Products were separated by electrophoresis in denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. The gels were quantified on a PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For simultaneous stimulation of Fen1 by PCNA and the 9-1-1 complex, PCNA was added first and reactions were incubated for 10 min
