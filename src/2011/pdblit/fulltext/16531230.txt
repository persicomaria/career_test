SWIRM is a conserved domain found in several chromatin-associated proteins. Based on their sequences, the SWIRM family members can be classified into three subfamilies, which are represented by Swi3, LSD1, and Ada2. Here we report the SWIRM structure of human MYb-like, Swirm and Mpn domain-containing protein-1 (MYSM1). The MYSM1 SWIRM structure forms a compact HTH-related fold comprising five -helices, which best resembles the Swi3 SWIRM structure, among the known SWIRM structures. The MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM structures are more similar to the LSD1 structure than the Ada2 structure. The SWIRM domains of MYSM1 and LSD1 lacked DNA binding activity, while those of Ada2 and the human Swi3 counterpart, SMARCC2, bound DNA. The dissimilarity in the DNA-binding ability of the MYSM1 and SMARCC2 SWIRM domains might be due to a couple of amino acid differences in the last helix. These results indicate that the SWIRM family has indeed diverged into three structural subfamilies (Swi3/MYSM1, LSD1, and Ada2 types), and that the Swi3/ MYSM1-type subfamily has further diverged into two functionally distinct groups. We also solved the structure of the SANT domain of MYSM1, and demonstrated that it bound DNA with a similar mode to that of the c-Myb DNA-binding domain.

Structures of SWIRM Domains

223 The roles of the SWIRM domains are still undefined. For example, it was reported that the Ada2 SWIRM domain (Ada2-type) bound DNA and a dinucleosome.16 In addition, the SMARCC2 SWIRM domain (Swi3-type) bound a di-nucleosome 16 and the Swi3 SWIRM domain (Swi3-type) bound both DNA and a mono-nucleosome.17 The Rsc8 SWIRM domain (Swi3-type) can also weakly interact with DNA,17 while the SWIRM domaincontaining region of Rsc8 is assumed to be involved in protein binding.11,18,19 Furthermore, the LSD1 SWIRM domain (LSD1-type) is thought to mediate protein­protein interactions.15,20 Therefore, it is essential to comprehensively compare the structures and functions of the SWIRM domain subtypes, which are dispersed throughout broad categories of histone-interactive protein complexes, to clearly understand the roles of the SWIRM domains. To gain insights into the structures and functions of the SWIRM family members, we compared all of the SWIRM domain subtypes. Here, we determined the tertiary structure of the human MYSM1 protein, an uncharacterized protein that contains a SWIRM domain sandwiched between an N-terminal SANT domain and a C-terminal JAMM domain (Figure 1). Through the comparison of the four SWIRM structures (i.e. the MYSM1, Swi3, LSD1, and Ada2 SWIRM structures), we found that the SWIRM domains of MYSM1, Swi3, and LSD1 are structurally distinct from that of Ada2, in terms of the secondary structure composition. From the viewpoint of surface characteristics, the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM domains differ from the LSD1 SWIRM domain. Furthermore, we found that, in MYSM1, the SWIRM domain was not a DNA-binding domain, but the SANT domain, which is located in the N-terminal region of MYSM1, exhibited DNA-binding activity. Based on the structural and functional diversity of the SWIRM subtypes, we discuss the molecular evolution of the SWIRM family.

Introduction
Eukaryotic DNA metabolism, including RNA transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair, is regulated through the maintenance and the dynamic alterations of chromatin structure.1­3 For this regulation, covalent modifications of the flanking tails of core histones (histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) are assumed to be the most critical hallmarks, leading to the "histone code" hypothesis.4 Typically, the modifications (e.g. acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation) of specific residues (i.e. Lys, Arg, Ser, and Thr) in the N-terminal tails of core histones are catalyzed by huge protein complexes with one or more enzymatic activities.5,6 Interestingly, several conserved domains are often found in these histone-interactive complexes, such as the bromodomain, the chromodomain, and the SANT (Swi3, Ada2, NCoR, and TFIIIB) domain. 7­10 Another such conserved domain is the SWIRM (Swi3, Rsc8, and Moira) domain, which was recently identified using computational methods.11 The SWIRM domain is present in many different histone-interactive complexes, including several subunits (e.g. Swi3/SMARCC1/SMARCC2 and Rsc8) of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, the histone demethylase LSD1 of the CtBP multi-enzyme complex, and the transcriptional adaptor Ada2 of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex11­14 (see Figure 1). The SWIRM domains have been classified into three main subfamilies (Swi3, LSD1, and Ada2 types), based on their domain architectures and sequence homologies.15 Recently, three tertiary structures of SWIRM domains were reported: the SWIRM structures of mouse Ada216, yeast Swi3,17 and human LSD1.15 All of these SWIRM structures form a compact helix-turn-helix (HTH)-related fold, in which a long central -helix is surrounded by several short helices,15­17 indicating the conservation of the SWIRM folds.

Results
Solution structure of the MYSM1 SWIRM domain We determined the NMR structure of the human MYSM1 SWIRM domain, using a protein sample (region from His367 to Arg470) expressed in a cellfree system.21,22 The backbone resonance assignments of the MYSM1 SWIRM domain were almost complete, except for Lys430, Asn439, Gly441, Asn444, and six residues in the tag-derived sequence. The side-chain assignments were complete, with the exception of H of Phe397. Among the

labile side-chain protons, the amide groups of all of the Asn and Gln residues, except for Gln402, the  and -proton resonances of Arg383, and the proton resonances of Arg413, were assigned using nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs). Pro425 was in the cis conformation, while the other five Pro residues were in the trans conformation, as confirmed by the intensity of the sequential nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) cross-peaks,23 and by the C and C chemical shift differences.24 A superimposed ensemble of the 20 lowest target function structures of the MYSM1 SWIRM domain is shown in Figure 2(a).

Structures of SWIRM Domains

225 Swi3 SWIRM domains as belonging to the same structural subfamily (i.e. Swi3/MYSM1-type) of the SWIRM domain. We found that the SWIRM structure of MYSM1 is stabilized by the formation of a hydrophobic core, as also observed in the other SWIRM domains.15­17 The residues responsible for the formation of the hydrophobic core are marked with orange circles in Figure 3. These residues are highly conserved among all of the SWIRM subtypes (Figure 3), which results in the formation of the common compact core of the SWIRM structure. Also conserved among all of the SWIRM subtypes are the residues corresponding to Glu390 and Arg413 in the MYSM1 SWIRM domain (acidic and basic residues marked by red and blue circles, respectively, in Figure 3), which form the characteristic electrostatic interaction between helices II and IV. The four solved SWIRM structures share a long (at least 18 amino acid residues) central helix (helix IV) that is packed against the rest of the helices (Figures 2(b) and 3). This central helix (IV) and the two surrounding helices (V and VI) form an HTH-related fold. Comparison of the SWIRM folds We next compared the folds of the four SWIRM structures (Figure 4(a)). Although these SWIRM structures were similar to each other, we found three major differences in their folds. First, as described, the LSD1 SWIRM structure differs from the MYSM1, Swi3, and Ada2 SWIRM structures, in that it has an additional helix (helix I) at its N terminus (shown in light magenta in the third panel of Figure 4(a)). This helix is stabilized by a hydrophobic interaction between two Ala residues (Ala177 and Ala178 of helix I) and one Leu (Leu218 of helix IV), which may protect the salt-bridge between helices II and IV. Second, the Ada2 SWIRM structure differs from the MYSM1, Swi3, and LSD1 SWIRM structures, in that it has a longer helix II and lacks a helix corresponding to helix III (highlighted as magenta ribbons in Figure 4(a)). The structure-based alignment shown in Figure 3 indicated that a P-s-h motif (where P is a Pro, s is a polar residue, and h is a hydrophobic residue; marked with green circles in Figure 3) is conserved in helix III of the MYSM1, Swi3, and LSD1 SWIRM structures. Close-up views around helix II are shown in Figure 4(b). In the MYSM1, Swi3, and LSD1 SWIRM structures, the hydrogen bond network is disrupted at the position of the Pro in the P-s-h motif, for which the sidechains are shown in green (Figure 4(b)). This results in the formation of the short helix III, which bends away from helix II (top three panels in Figure 4(b)). The hydrophilic residue next to the Pro (s; Glu396 of MYSM1, Glu329 of Swi3, and Asp198 of LSD1) is exposed to the solvent. The next hydrophobic residue (h; Phe397 of MYSM1, Phe330 of Swi3, and Ile199 of LSD1) contributes to the formation of the hydrophobic core, and stabilizes the position of

constraints and the structural quality of these SWIRM domains are summarized in Table 1. The structure of the human MYSM1 SWIRM domain consists of five -helices, as shown in Figure 2(b). To avoid confusion during the subsequent structural comparisons, we tentatively designated the first helix, comprising Glu388­Ile394, as helix II. Similarly, the second (Pro395­Phe398), third (Pro406­ Cys423), fourth (Lys430­Arg434), and fifth (Val443­ Ile456) helices were designated as helices III, IV, V, and VI, respectively (Figure 2(b)). Among the known SWIRM structures, the MYSM1 SWIRM structure was most similar to the Swi3 SWIRM structure.17 The RMSD74CA,C,N value for the backbones between the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM structures was 1.06 Å. Structure-based sequence alignment of the SWIRM family Based on the folds of the MYSM1, Swi3, LSD1, and Ada2 SWIRM structures, 15 the representative SWIRM sequences were aligned (Figure 3). This structure-based sequence alignment indicated that the helix composition of the MYSM1 SWIRM structure is the same as that of the Swi3 SWIRM structure (Figure 3). In addition, the MYSM1, Swi3, and Ada2 SWIRM domains lack the helix corresponding to helix I of the LSD1 SWIRM domain (Figure 3). Furthermore, the alignment revealed that the position of helix III is conserved among the MYSM1, Swi3, and LSD1 SWIRM domains. The sequence of the residues composing helix III in the MYSM1 SWIRM domain is identical to that of Swi3 and its mammalian counterparts, SMARCC1 and -2 (Figure 3). Considering the structural and sequence conservation, we hereafter regard the MYSM1 and

227 around this area in the LSD1 SWIRM structure.15 In addition, the hydrophobic residue just before the P-s-h motif (Ile394 of MYSM1, Leu327 of Swi3, and

helix III itself. Consequently, the P-s-h motif, which is conserved among the Swi3 and LSD1-types (Figure 3), forms a specific hydrophobic cleft

228 Phe196 of LSD1, shown in purple in Figures 3 and 4(b)) interacts with a hydrophobic residue of helix VI (Tyr452 of MYSM1, Phe384 of Swi3, and Tyr255 of LSD1). However, the corresponding residue in the Ada2 SWIRM domain (Cys384, which is four residues away from the salt-bridging basic residue; shown in purple in Figures 3 and 4(b), bottom panel) interacts with the first residue of helix IV (Pro391). The third difference is the length of the loop between helices V and VI (Figure 4(a)), which corresponds to the loop of the HTH motif.25,26 This loop is composed of three residues in the Ada2 SWIRM domain (Figures 3 and 4(a), bottom panel), whereas it comprises eight and six residues in the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM domains, respectively (Figure 3). The loop in the LSD1 SWIRM domain is composed of eight residues, with a partially helical structure (Figures 3 and 4(a), third panel). The loop length of the Ada2 SWIRM domain is as short as that of the Myb DNA-binding domain.25,26 In addition to these three differences, the Nterminal end region of the MYSM1 SWIRM domain is close to the C-terminal part of helix VI (Figure 2(a), B). This structural feature is specific to the MYSM1 SWIRM domain, among the four SWIRM structures. Comparison of the SWIRM surfaces Next, we compared the surface charge distributions (Figure 5(a)) of the four SWIRM structures. The comparisons revealed that each SWIRM structure has distinct surface characteristics. Interestingly, the Ada2 SWIRM surface is quite basic (Figure 5(a), bottom panel). On the other hand, the LSD1 SWIRM surface has a rather acidic nature (Figure 5(a), third panel). The MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM surfaces have a mixed, but rather basic, charge distribution (Figure 5(a), top and second panels). Subsequently, we compared the distribution of conserved surface residues (Figure 5(b)). The conserved basic residues are most prominent in the Ada2 SWIRM structure (shown in cyan in the bottom panel of Figure 5(b)). On the other hand, the LSD1 SWIRM structure has a conserved hydrophobic surface, which forms a narrow cleft with an overhang composed of a pair of ionic residues (Figure 5(b), third panel). The surface characteristics of the MYSM1 (Figure 5(b), top panel) and Swi3 (second panel) SWIRM structures are both more

similar to that of the LSD1 SWIRM structure (third panel) than to that of the Ada2 SWIRM structure (bottom panel), because the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM structures have (1) a hydrophobic surface similar to that in the cleft of the LSD1 SWIRM domain, and (2) a couple of ionic residues on the hydrophobic surface (Figure 5(b)). However, in contrast to the conserved Asp at position 198 of LSD1, a Glu is conserved at the corresponding position in MYSM1 and Swi3 (Figures 3 and 5(b)). As a result, the hydrophobic surfaces of the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM structures seem to be filled by Glu, which has a larger side-chain than Asp (Figure 5(b)). Despite these similarities between the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM surfaces, we found an important difference between these surfaces: two Lys residues that are responsible for the DNA binding in Swi3 (Figures 3 and 5(b), indicated in black) are not conserved in MYSM1. DNA-binding activities of the SWIRM and SANT domains Next, we examined the DNA-binding abilities of the SWIRM domains. We carried out an in vitro binding assay by the surface plasmon resonance method, using double-stranded cytomegalovirus promoter DNA with a TATA box sequence (CMVTATA). As expected, the Ada2 and SMARCC2 SWIRM domains interacted with the DNA, but the LSD1 SWIRM domain did not (Figure 6(a)).16,17,27,28 Under these conditions, the MYSM1 SWIRM domain did not exhibit DNA-binding activity (Figure 6(a)). Similar results were obtained using a different DNA sequence (data not shown). These results indicate that, unlike the SMARCC2 SWIRM domain, the MYSM1 SWIRM domain is not a DNAbinding domain. To gain insight into the functional role of the MYSM1 protein, we also tested the DNA-binding activity of the SANT domain, which is often found in SWIRM-containing proteins (shown as yellow ovals in Figure 1). Interestingly, the MYSM1 SANT domain strongly bound to the CMV-TATA DNA, while the SANT domain of Ada2 did not show DNA-binding activity (Figure 6(b)). The MYSM1 fragment containing both the SANT and SWIRM domains (residues 117 to 470) also bound to the CMV-TATA DNA, but the existence of the SWIRM domain did not enhance the DNA-binding activity of the SANT domain (data not shown).

(b) Close-up views showing the structural differences around helix II. The main chains are indicated by gray ribbons or loops. The side-chains are indicated by gray ball-and-stick models. The side-chains of the three residues composing the P-s-h motif (Pro395, Glu396, and Phe397 in MYSM1; Pro328, Glu329, and Phe330 in Swi3; and Pro196, Asp197, and Ile198 in LSD1) are highlighted in green. In the MYSM1, Swi3, and LSD1 SWIRM structures, the residue before the Pro, which is located in helix II, is highlighted in purple. The corresponding residue in the Ada2 SWIRM structure (Cys384; also shown in purple) was determined by the sequence distance from the salt-bridging basic residue of helix II.

mined the structure of the MYSM1 SANT domain (region from Tyr117 to Gly181) by NMR (Figure 7(a)). The structure of the MYSM1 SANT domain consists of three -helices (Figure 7(b)), and it is structurally related to the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb.29 The surface of the MYSM1 SANT structure is highly basic (Figure 7(c)), which is quite consistent with its DNA-binding activity (Figure 6(b)). Next, we performed the NMR chemical shift perturbation experiment with the CMV-TATA DNA to determine the DNA-binding surface of the MYSM1 SANT domain. As expected, addition of the equal molar DNA to the MYSM1 SANT domain yielded a chemical shift perturbation at many residues (shown in magenta in Figure 8(a)). On the other hand, the MYSM1 SWIRM residues were not significantly perturbed by the addition of the DNA (Figure 8(b)). We mapped the locations of the perturbed residues on the SANT fold (Figure 8(c)). Among these 15 residues, seven residues are located in the last helix of the SANT domain, which corresponds to the DNA recognition helix of the cMyb DNA-binding domain29 (Figure 8(c)). Six of the perturbed helix residues (Lys156, Ser157, Arg160, Gln161, Phe163, and Asn165) are on the molecular surface (Figure 8(d)). Four other surface residues (Trp121, Arg139, Lys142, and Lys168), which are located near the last helix, were also strongly affected by the addition of the DNA (Figure 8(d)). A structure-based alignment of the MYSM1 SANT domain and the c-Myb DNA-binding domain (Figure 9(a)) allows us to postulate a possible DNA-binding model for the MYSM1 SANT domain (Figure 9(b)). We utilized the C positions of the protein-DNA complex structure of the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb (PDB ID code 1MSE) as the reference C positions. With the exception of Lys142 and Arg160, all of the lysine and arginine residues were conserved and well-superimposed. The postulated DNA-binding model of the MYSM1 SANT domain is quite consistent with the result of the NMR perturbation experiment. Phylogenetic analysis of the SWIRM family members To understand the diversity of the SWIRM family members, we constructed an unrooted phylogenetic tree of the SWIRM domain family, by aligning the amino acid sequences of 74 SWIRM domains in the Pfam database (Figure 10). The phylogenetic tree of the SWIRM family has three major branches. From the structural and phylogenetic points of view, we grouped the SWIRM family members into

We further divided the Swi3 subfamily members into two groups: one group containing MYSM1 (circled in light red in Figure 10) and the other group containing Swi3 and SMARCC2 (dark

red), based on their functional differences (described in Discussion).

Discussion
Here, we described the solution structures of the SWIRM domain (Figure 2) and the SANT domain (Figure 7) of MYSM1. The SWIRM domain of

MYSM1 did not show DNA-binding activity, while the SANT domain displayed considerable DNAbinding activity (Figures 6 and 8). In this section, we first compare the structures and functions of the SWIRM domain subtypes. We next discuss the possible function of MYSM1. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the SWIRM family proteins. Structural and functional relationship of the SWIRM domains The SWIRM structures have two major common features. One is that all of the SWIRM subtypes have a topologically similar structure, consisting of four to six helices. Each subtype has the long central helix (helix IV), which is surrounded by the remaining three to five short helices (Figure 4(a)). The central helix IV interacts with one of the surrounding helices (helix II) through an electrostatic interaction mediated by a pair of ionic residues (shown by red and blue circles in Figure 3). The other feature is that

the SWIRM structure has a three-helix bundle fold, composed of helices IV, V, and VI, which is related to the HTH motif15­17,26 (Figure 4(a)). Since these two features are conserved among the four solved SWIRM structures, we concluded that all of the SWIRM structures share a common fold. However, there are several differences between the Swi3/ MYSM1 and LSD1-type SWIRM domains and the Ada2-type SWIRM domain, in terms of their folds, surfaces and functions. First, in the SWIRM folds, the Ada2 SWIRM structure has a longer helix at the position of helix II than those of the MYSM1, Swi3, and LSD1 SWIRM structures. Most interestingly, the corresponding sequences of the MYSM1, Swi3, and LSD1 SWIRM domains are divided by the Pro of the P-s-h motif (shown in a green circle in Figure 3), yielding another new, short helix (helix III), which bends away from helix II (Figure 4(a), top three panels). The fold and the orientation of helix III are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions among several residues

The DaliLite program56 was used for a pairwise structure comparison between the SANT domain of MYSM1 and the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb. The model was depicted by aligning the C atoms of the structurally equivalent residues. The side-chains of all of the lysine and arginine residues are indicated by blue stick models.

located near the Pro (Figure 4(b), top three panels), resulting in the formation of a putative proteinbinding, hydrophobic cleft in the LSD1 SWIRM structure (Figure 5(b), third panel).15 These interactions are also well conserved in the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM structures (Figure 4(b), top and second panels), suggesting that the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM structures may also utilize this fold as a protein-binding pocket (Figure 5(b); described below). Second, on the SWIRM surfaces, the charge distribution of the Ada2 SWIRM structure is the most basic, as compared to those of the other three SWIRM structures (Figure 5(a)). Importantly, most of the basic surface residues are conserved among

the Ada2-type members (Figures 3 and 5(b) bottom), and four of the five residues are clustered at the HTH-related fold (Figure 3). These features suggest that the Ada2-type SWIRM domains represent a distinct subfamily, with different structures and functions from those of the canonical (i.e. Swi3/MYSM1 or LSD1-type) SWIRM domains. On the other hand, the surface characteristics of the MYSM1, Swi3, and LSD1 SWIRM structures resemble each other, in terms of the distribution of the conserved surface residues (Figure 5(b), top to third panels). However, the conserved hydrophobic surfaces of the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM structures, which correspond to the hydrophobic cleft of the LSD1 SWIRM

Figure 10. An unrooted phylogenetic tree of the SWIRM family. The scale bar indicates the number of substitutions per site. The sequences used in the alignment of Figure 3 are indicated in bold, with the respective protein name and the abbreviation of the corresponding species (Hs, human; Mm, mouse; Dm, fruit fly; Ce, nematode; Sp, fission yeast; Sc, budding yeast). Other proteins are shown with the abbreviation of the database (tr, TrEMBL; sp, Swiss-Prot), the accession number, and the species abbreviation. Note that the phylogenetic tree of the SWIRM family has three major branches. Based on structural and functional evidence, we grouped the SWIRM family members into three subfamilies: the Swi3/ MYSM1-type (circled in red), the LSD1-type (green), and the Ada2-type (blue). Based on the functional differences, the Swi3/MYSM1-type subfamily members could be divided into two groups: one group containing MYSM1 (circled in light red) and the other group containing Swi3 and SMARCC2 (dark red).

structure, are buried by the side-chain of the conserved glutamate at 396 and 329, respectively, positioned as the hydrophilic residue of the P-s-h motif (Figures 3 and 5(b), top and second panels). Thus, Glu396 and Glu329, in the MYSM1 and Swi3 SWIRM structures, respectively, might have to undergo a conformational change for this hydrophobic cleft to be utilized for possible interactions with other proteins. Further investigations of the protein-binding activity of the MYSM1 SWIRM domain will be necessary to understand the role of this hydrophobic surface. Third, for the SWIRM functions, we observed that the SWIRM domains of Ada2 and SMARCC2 interacted with DNA, strongly and weakly, respectively, while those of MYSM1 and LSD1 did not interact with DNA (Figure 6(a)). The considerable

DNA-binding activity specifically observed with the Ada2 SWIRM domain, among the four SWIRM domains examined (Figure 6(a)), is quite consistent with the aforementioned structural differences (Figures 4 and 5). The DNA-binding activity of the SMARCC2 SWIRM domain was much weaker than that of the Ada2 SWIRM (Figure 6(a)). While attempting to solve the structures of the different SWIRM domains, we had difficulty in determining the structure of the SWIRM domain of human SMARCC2 (Glu419­Thr521), since it was partially unfolded, as judged by the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra (data not shown). This is a possible reason for the difference in the DNA-binding affinity of Swi3 (ref. 17) and our SMARCC2. The lack of DNA-binding activity in the LSD1 SWIRM domain (Figure 6(a)) was con-

235 regulators, and is considered as a catalytic domain of metalloproteases for ubiquitin.32­34 Therefore, the MYSM1 SWIRM domain may contribute to the removal of ubiquitin from chromatin-associated proteins. It would be intriguing to examine whether MYSM1 could associate with ubiquitinated chromatin proteins, such as histones H2A/H2B. Evolution of the SWIRM family As described, the Ada2-type SWIRM domain structurally differs from the other SWIRM subtypes (i.e. Swi3/MYSM1- and LSD1-types). The phylogenetic tree, constructed using the 74 SWIRM domain sequences in the Pfam database (Figure 10), revealed that the SWIRM sequences indeed fall into three clusters: the Swi3/MYSM1-type (circled in red, containing Swi3 and MYSM1), the LSD1-type (green, containing LSD1), and the Ada2-type (blue, containing Ada2) (Figure 10). Curiously, the LSD1type SWIRM domain exists in fission yeast and higher organisms, but not in budding yeast, which has the Swi3 and Ada2-types of SWIRM domains.11,14 Considering the structural resemblance between the Swi3/MYSM1 and LSD1 SWIRM domains, it is possible that the Swi3/MYSM1-type and Ada2-type SWIRM proteins had diverged before the appearance of the LSD1-type SWIRM. An Ada2-type SWIRM protein might have originated from a common ancestor of a SWIRM prototype that belongs to the Swi3/MYSM1-type (i.e. Swi3 or Rsc8) in budding yeast or a closely related species. An LSD1-type SWIRM protein must have diverged from a Swi3/MYSM1-type SWIRM protein in fission yeast or a closely related species, at least after the branching of budding yeast and fission yeast. Among the Swi3/MYSM1-type subfamily members, this phylogenetic tree also indicated that the group containing MYSM1 (circled in light red in Figure 10) may have functionally diverged from the "ancestor" group containing Swi3 and SMARCC2 (dark red in Figure 10), because the SWIRM domains of Swi3 and SMARCC2, but not that of MYSM1, have DNA-binding activity (16,17; this study). We conclude that the Ada2-type SWIRM domain represents a distinct subtype, and that the Swi3/MYSM1-type (including MYSM1group) and LSD1-type SWIRM domains are the canonical SWIRM (SWI3, Rsc8, and Moira) representatives.

sistent with previous reports.27,28 As for the MYSM1 SWIRM domain, despite its structural resemblance to the Swi3 SWIRM domain, it did not exhibit DNAbinding activity (Figure 6(a)). This functional difference might be a consequence of the nonconservation of the two residues responsible for DNA-binding in Swi3 (Figure 3, indicated by black circles; the two residues are also shown in black in the second panel of Figure 5(b)). In addition, the loop between helices V and VI of MYSM1, which is two amino acid residues longer than that of Swi3 (Figures 3 and 4(a), top and second panels), might also inhibit DNA-binding. Furthermore, the close proximity of the N-terminal end of the MYSM1 SWIRM domain and its helix VI, which is specifically observed in MYSM1, might hinder the ability of the MYSM1 SWIRM domain to bind DNA (Figure 2(a) and (b)). Collectively, the MYSM1type subfamily may have functionally diverged from the Swi3-type subfamily. Our results, together with previous observations, 15­17,20 implied that there are at least two functionally different kinds of SWIRM domains: the protein-binding and nonDNA-binding SWIRM domain of LSD1 (15,20,27,28; this study), and the DNA-binding SWIRM domains of Ada2 and Swi3/SMARCC2 (16,17; this study). The recognition of different intracellular substrates (e.g. protein and DNA) by conserved domain folds has been reported, including the cases of HTH-related domains (e.g. SANT and MybDBD), chromo-related domains, and zinc finger domains. 8­10,26,30 Our results indicate that the SWIRM domain family has also functionally diverged, to allow the recognition of different kinds of biomolecules. Possible functions of MYSM1 To date there has been no report on the function of MYSM1. Here, we found that the N-terminal SANT domain of MYSM1 could bind DNA (Figure 6(b)) while the central SWIRM domain could not (Figure 6(a)). These features of MYSM1 are quite different from those of Ada2, which has a nonDNA-binding SANT domain and a DNA-binding SWIRM domain (16; this study). Considering the DNA-binding activity of MYSM1 (Figure 6(b)), which has a similar DNA-binding mode to the cMyb DNA-binding domain (Figures 8(c) and (d), and 9(b)), it is likely that MYSM1 also functions in a chromatin-mediated event(s). The inability of the MYSM1 SWIRM domain to interact with DNA leads us to postulate that it may associate with, or be involved in, some chromatin components. In the case of LSD1, its SWIRM domain in isolation can interact with a histone tail peptide,15 and it forms a hydrophobic, concave surface for recognition of a histone tail, in collaboration with the histone demethylase domain at its C terminus.31 In MYSM1, a JAMM domain (residues 572 to 682) is located next to the SWIRM domain, at the C-terminal region. The JAMM domain is found in proteasome regulatory subunits as well as in transcriptional

Experimental Procedures

(Invitrogen), as a fusion with an N-terminal histidineaffinity tag and a TEV protease cleavage site. The 13 C/15N-labeled fusion proteins were synthesized by a cell-free protein expression system.21,22 Protein purification The cell-free reaction solutions of the MYSM1 and Ada2 SWIRM domains were adsorbed onto HiTrap Chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences), which were eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 500 mM sodium chloride and 500 mM imidazole. The MYSM1 SANT domain was adsorbed onto a HiTrap Chelating column, which was eluted with 20 mM TrisHCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 M sodium chloride and 500 mM imidazole. The eluted MYSM1 SWIRM domain was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with the TEV protease, while the Ada2 SWIRM domain and the MYSM1 SANT domain were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with the TEV protease and 5 mM EDTA. The samples were loaded on Hitrap SP columns (Amersham Biosciences), which were eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 300 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM imidazole. Each fractionated lysate was applied to a HiTrap Chelating column, equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM imidazole, which was eluted with a concentration gradient of imidazole (500 mM final concentration). The flowthrough fractions of the SWIRM domains were concentrated to 4 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 300 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM 1,4-DLdithiothreitol (DTT), 4 mM NTA, and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (complete, EDTA-free (Roche)). The MYSM1 SANT domain was concentrated to about 4 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 300 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM imidazole, and 0.5 mM EDTA. The NMR samples of the two SWIRM domains contained about 1 mM protein in 20 mM d-TrisHCl buffer (pH 7.0) with 100 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM d10-DTT, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, and 10% 2H2O/90% 1H2O. The MYSM1 SANT domain contained about 1 mM protein in 20 mM sodium acetate-d3 buffer (pH 4.5) with 100 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM d10-DTT, 0.02% NaN3, and 10% 2H2O/90% 1H2O. NMR spectroscopy All NMR data for the MYSM1 SWIRM domain were collected on a Bruker AVANCE600 spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance CryoProbe, while the NOESY spectra were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE700 spectrometer at 296 K. NMR data for the Ada2 SWIRM domain were collected on a Bruker AVANCE600 spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance CryoProbe, while the NOESY spectra were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE800 spectrometer at 296 K. NMR data for the MYSM1 SANT domain were collected on a Bruker AVANCE600 spectrometer, while the NOESY spectra were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE800 spectrometer at 298 K. Sequencespecific backbone chemical shift assignments were achieved with the 13C/15N-labeled sample, using standard triple-resonance experiments.35 Assignments of sidechains were obtained from HBHA(CBCA)(CO)NH, C(CO) NH, HC(C)H-TOCSY, and HC(C)H-COSY spectra.36­39 15 N-edited NOESY and 13C-edited NOESY spectra with 80 ms mixing times were used to determine the distance restraints.

Structures of SWIRM Domains Structure determination and analysis All of the spectra were processed with the program NMRPipe.40 The programs KUJIRA (N. Kobayashi, personal communication) and NMRView 41,42 were employed for visualization of the NMR spectra and chemical shift assignments. Automated NOE assignments and structure calculations with torsion angle dynamics were performed using the software package CYANA.43­46 Dihedral angle restraints were derived using the program TALOS.47 A total of 100 structures were independently calculated. The 20 conformers with the lowest targetfunction values were finally selected. Structural quality was evaluated using PROCHECK-NMR48 and WHATCHECK.49 The programs MOLMOL50 and PyMol51 were used to analyze the calculated structures and to prepare drawings of the structures. Throughout this study, we used our Ada2 SWIRM structure (2CUJ) for comparisons to the three other SWIRM structures, because all of these structures, except for the Swi3 SWIRM structure, were determined with samples prepared using essentially the same experimental method, and were solved with the same structure calculation methods. Our Ada2 SWIRM structure (PDB ID: 2CUJ) consisted of four -helices. The first (Glu378­Val387), second (Pro391­Gln408), third (Leu413­Ile420), and fourth (Val424­Arg436) helices were tentatively designated as helices II, IV, V, and VI, respectively. In the Swi3 SWIRM structure (2FQ3), the first (Ser321­Leu327), second (Pro328­Phe331), third (Pro340­Asn357), fourth (Val364­Arg368), and fifth (Ala375­Trp388) helices were tentatively designated as helices II, III, IV, V, and VI, respectively. DNA-binding assay The DNA-binding assay was carried out on a Biacore 3000 instrument, using streptavidin sensor chips (Biacore). The solved SWIRM domains of MYSM1, Ada2, and LSD1, and the SWIRM domain of human SMARCC2 (Glu419­Thr521) were used for the analysis. Biotin-labeled oligonucleotides (CMV-TATA: Biotin-5'-TGGGAGGTCTATATAAGCAGAGCTCG-3') were annealed with the complementary non-labeled oligonucleotides in a buffer containing 100 mM sodium chloride. Approximately 700 resonance units of the double-stranded oligonucleotides were immobilized to the sensor chip, using HBS-EP buffer (10 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM sodium chloride, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% Tween-20). Then, the purified proteins were loaded for 60 s at a 10 l/min flow rate onto the oligonucleotide-immobilized sensor chip, and the flow was continued for 60 s. Control surfaces with no oligonucleotide attached were used to correct for refractive index differences between the protein solution and the buffer. The results were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 4.1 software. NMR perturbation experiment The MYSM1 SANT and MYSM1 SWIRM domain samples were dialyzed against HBS-EP buffer. 2H2O was added to the samples to a final concentration of 10%. Throughout the NMR perturbation experiments, the sample concentration was kept at 0.1 mM, while the concentration of the CMV-TATA DNA was increased from 0 to 0.8 mM (0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mM). After each titration step, the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded, and the changes in chemical shifts were analyzed using NMRView.41,42

Structures of SWIRM Domains Phylogenetic analysis The amino acid sequences of typical SWIRM domains, which were classified as members of the "SWIRM family" in the Pfam database, were aligned using the Clustal W program.52 The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method, using the TreeView program.53 Protein Data Bank accession numbers The structural coordinates of the human MYSM1 SWIRM, mouse Ada2 SWIRM, and human MYSM1 SANT domains have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, under the accession codes 2DCE, 2CUJ, and 2CU7, respectively.
