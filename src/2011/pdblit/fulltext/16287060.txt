ABSTRACT The crystal structure of the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) heterodimer from Naja naja sagittifera reveals the presence of a new PLA2-like protein with eight disulphide bridges. The heterodimer is formed between a commonly observed group I PLA2 having seven characteristic disulfide bonds and a novel PLA2-like protein (Cys­PLA2) containing two extra cysteines at two highly conserved sites (positions 32 and 49) of structural and functional importantance. The crystals of the heterodimer belong to tetragonal space group P41212 with cell dimensions, a b 77.7 Å and c 68.4 Å corresponding to a solvent content of 33%, which is one of the lowest values observed so far in the PLA2 crystals. The structure has been solved with molecular replacement method and refined to a final R value of 21.6% [Rfree 25.6%]. The electron density revealed the presence of cysteines 32 and 49 that are covalently linked to give rise to an eighth disulphide bridge in the PLA2-like monomer. A non-protein high-quality electron density was also observed at the substratebinding site in the PLA2-like protein that has been interpreted as N-acetylglucosamine. The overall tertiary folds of the two monomers are similar having all features of PLA2-type folding. A zinc ion is detected at the interface of the heterodimer with fivefold coordination while another zinc ion was found on the surface of Cys­PLA2 with sixfold coordination. The conformations of the calcium-binding loops of both monomers are significantly different from each other as well as from those in other group I PLA2s. The N-acetylglucosamine molecule is favorably placed in the substrate-binding site of Cys­PLA2 and forms five hydrogen bonds and several van der Waals interactions with protein atoms, thus indicating a strong affinity. It also provides clue of the possible mechanism of sugar recognition by PLA2 and PLA2-like proteins. The formation of heterodimer seems to have been induced by zinc ion. Proteins 2006;62:329 ­337.

INTRODUCTION Secretory phospholipase A2s (PLA2, phosphatide acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.4) have been classified into various groups using different parameters. The most common criteria used for classification have been based on the overall structures of the enzymes, number and locations of disulfide bridges, and mechanisms of catalysis. Although several classes of PLA2s have been reported,1 only groups I and II have been characterized extensively. The group I enzymes typically contain about 115 to 120 amino-acid residues and seven disulfide bridges. The group II enzymes were found having 120 to 125 amino-acid residues and seven disulfide bridges. The group II differs from group I enzymes for having a C-terminal extension of five to six amino acids and a disulfide bridge linking Cterminal segment with Cys 50. The PLA2s of group I and II generally contain an aspartate residue at position 49 which plays an important role in the binding of Ca2 ion and is also critically involved in the enzymatic activity by participating in the hydrogen-bonding scheme in the active site through His 48. In some of the PLA2 enzymes, this residue has been replaced by Lys 492-4, thus causing considerable loss of enzymatic activity, significantly affecting calcium-binding capability and reducing the protonation effects. In some instances, serine has also been found at position 49.5. In spite of its critical role, Asp 49 mutations have been observed several times.2­ 4 A few isoforms have also been found with six disulfide bridges instead of the typical seven.6 The group I and II enzymes contain a characteristic calcium-binding loop with a conserved sequence of Tyr 25­Gly­Cys­Tyr/Phe­Cys­Gly­X­Gl­Gly 33 having a cagelike structure. The presence of two Cys and four Gly residues in the loop provides a delicate balance between

rigidity and flexibility in the loop with a specific compatibility to calcium coordination. The delicate balance of Gly and Cys residues is important for calcium binding. In addition to the basic function of hydrolyzing phospholipids at sn-2 ester bond, the PLA2s also elicit various other biological responses via their specific receptors. Unfortunately, the studies about possible modes of their binding to cell surface receptors are lacking. Much less is known about the nature of interactions and the site of binding in PLA2s. Some snake venom PLA2 enzymes are also known that require additional protein factors to express their pharmacological effects at full potency. These proteins get associated with PLA2 enzymes in different ways. In some cases, they form covalent complexes7 whereas in others a simple molecular association may occur.8 Some of them form higher order aggregates in crystals while in dilute physiological conditions they may exist as monomers.9 Although the existence of heteropolymeric PLA2s has long been established,8 the understanding of the basis of oligomerization and its consequences on the PLA2 activities are not yet understood clearly. The crystal structure of the heterodimer formed between a group I PLA2 enzyme and a PLA2-like protein (Cys­PLA2) at 2.3 Å resolution is reported here. The structure reveals the presence of an N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) molecule in the substrate-binding site of Cys­PLA2. This is the first observation that shows the binding of a saccharide at the substrate-binding site. This is also the first structure that reports two unusual natural mutations of Gly 32 and Asp 49 to Cys 32 and Cys 49 and also the first case of a PLA2-like protein with eight disulphide bridges. Also, the presence of zinc ions, one at the interface of the dimer and another on the surface of the PLA2-like monomer, may provide useful information about the effects of metal ions on the state of aggregation of PLA2s. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Isolation and Purification The lyophilized samples of venom from Naja naja sagittifera were obtained from Irula Snake Catchers Industrial Cooperative Society (Chennai, India). The venom was dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 at 50 mg/mL concentration by stirring it for 30 min at 25°C. The solution was cleared by centrifugation at 12000 g for 10 min. This was size fractionated on Sephadex G-150 column that was pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 6 mL/h. The elution profile showed five peaks. The peak corresponding to molecular weight of 14 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulphate­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was collected for further purification. The pooled fractions were desalted and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 and loaded on carboxymethyl C-50 column. The column was washed with the above buffer. The unbound fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. This was finally loaded on a Cibacron blue affinity column pre-equilibrated with 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.0.

The column was washed with same buffer. The column was eluted with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The eluted fractions containing protein peak were pooled, ultrafiltered, and lyophilized. Protein Sequence Determination The tissues from the venom gland of Naja naja sagittifera were obtained from Irula snake farm, with the permission of the Forest Department of the Tamil Nadu Government (Chennai, India) and the complete cDNA sequences were determined. The venom glands were homogenized in 4M GITC buffer (pH 5.0) in ice cooled conditions. The total RNAs were extracted by the phenol/chloroform method.10 The poly (A ) mRNAs were isolated from the total RNA using an oligo (dT) cellulose column (Amersham-Pharmacia). The small syringe column packed with oligo (dT) cellulose was washed with 10 mL of high salt buffer (1M NaCl, 1 mM Na2-EDTA, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The total RNA was mixed with an equal volume of high salt buffer and warmed to 65°C and cooled immediately by placing it in the ice. The chilled RNA was passed through the column. The column was washed with 3 mL of low salt buffer (0.1M NaCl, 1 mM Na2-EDTA), which was prewarmed at 65°C. The poly (A ) RNA was used for cDNA syntheses, which were carried out with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-reverse transcriptase using oligo (dT) primers. A portion (2 mL) of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for the PCR amplification of the genes. The conserved nucleotide sequences from snake venom phospholipase A2s were used for the design of primers. The sequences 5 CTACCTGTGGAGGCCAAAGGA3 and 5 AATTTATTGGACCTTCTGGCC3 were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCRs were carried out using Taq polymerase (Promega) using MJ research thermal cycler model PTC100. The nucleotide sequencing was carried out using the cloned double-stranded DNA (pGEM-T) on an automatic sequencer model ABI-377. Both strands were used for sequencing. Estimation of the Thiol Groups The quantification of the number of disulfide bonds in phospholipase A2 was done using the disodium 2-nitro-5thiosulfobenzoate (NTSB) method as described by Thannhauser and colleagues,11 and incorporating the modification of Damodaran.12 NTSB was synthesized according to Thannhauser and colleagues.11 The aliquoted stock was kept at 20°C until used. The NTSB assay solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution with freshly prepared 0.2M Tris-HCl containing 0.1M Na2SO3, 3 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 3M guanidine thiocyanate. The final pH was adjusted to 9.5. The NTSB concentration was 0.5 mM. One hundred milliliters of PLA2 solution in 0.2M Tris-HCl was added to 1.5 mL of NTSB assay solution in a cuvette. The solutions were mixed well and the increase in absorbance at 412 nm was monitored using PerkinElmer (Lambda 25) spectrophotometer. Estimations were carried out for five different concentrations of protein ranging from 1.0 10 6 to 5 10 5M

and the steps were repeated three times for every concentration. Dinitrosalicylic Acid Test Protein crystals were dissolved in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Aliquots of this solution ranging from 50 to 500 mL were diluted to 2.0 mL with the buffer and incubated at 50°C for 30 min. One milliliter of dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) solution was added to each of them. The samples were boiled for 15 min and centrifuged to remove any insoluble material. After cooling the supernatant, each sample was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 540 nm, which confirmed the presence of sugar in the crystals.13 Dynamic Light Scattering The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were made at different concentrations of protein containing two isoforms in the presence and absence of zinc ions. The studies were carried out with DLS system (RiNA, Berlin, Germany) and analyzed using the software described by Schulze.14 The sample solutions were prepared in 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.0, made in deionzed water obtained from a Millipore Alpha-Q system. The samples were filtered through 0.1 mm polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore). The protein concentration used was 10 mg/mL at a constant temperature. The samples were manually injected into the flow cell (50 mL) and illuminated with a 25 mW, 600 nm solid-state laser. The data were measured three times and averaged. Crystallization The purified and lyophilized protein samples were used for crystallization. The vapor diffusion hanging drop method was used for the initial screening of crystallization conditions. Crystals with a typical size of 0.25 0.10 0.05 mm3 were finally obtained by dissolving the protein at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer containing 2 mM zinc acetate, pH 6.5, that was equilibrated against the same buffer containing 25% ethanol. MALDI-TOF of the Samples from Crystals Crystals of the heterodimer were washed with 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5. Then the crystals were dried and dissolved in distilled water to attain an approximate concentration of 10 mg/mL. The mass spectrometric analysis was carried out on the protein crystals with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization­time of flight (MALDI-TOF) (KRATOS, Shimadzu, Japan). Prior to the acquisition of spectra, 100 mL of the solution was mixed with 100 mL of 0.2% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. One milliliter of the acidified solution was spotted onto a stainless-steel sample slide followed by 1 mL of 3,5dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) matrix solution (10 mg/mL in 50:50 ethanol/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). X-Ray Intensity Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement The crystals of the heterodimer were flash-frozen in nitrogen gas at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems cryostream

cooler). Data were collected using 345 mm MAR Research imaging plate scanner mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode X-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA, with the use of Osmic focusing optics. A data set of 80 images with scan angle of 1° with 10 min exposure per image was collected. The intensities were integrated, scaled, and merged with DENZO and SCALEPACK.15 The crystallographic data statistics are given in Table I. The structure was solved using molecular replacement method with the program AMoRe.16 The structure of PLA2 dimer from Naja naja sagittifera (PDB code: 1S6B)17 was used as a search model. Ca2 and water molecules were removed from the search model, but all side chains and the refined individual temperature factors were retained. Two strong peaks (8.2 and 6.5 over the means) were found in a cross-rotation function that was calculated using reflections between 12 and 3.5 Å (next highest peak 3.2 s). The highest 15 rotation solutions were used for a translation search, and after rigid-body refinement, the best solution, corresponding to the highest rotation and translation function solutions, gave an R value of 50.8% and a correlation coefficient of 36.4% (copy A). Another round of translation search was done while fixing the first molecule, using the next 14 sets of rotation angles found in the cross-rotation procedure. The highest correlation coefficient and R value corresponded to the second highest peak of the rotation function (copy B). After rigid-body refinement of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the R value was 47.6%, and the correlation coefficient was 58.6%. The molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by an approximate twofold rotation axis almost parallel to the b axis, explaining why a self-rotation function did not show a twofold non-crystallographic symmetry axis. Subsequent phase improvement was done using DM.18 Electron density maps were calculated using data to 2.5 Å after solvent flattening or solvent flipping and with and without twofold averaging. Ten percent of the data were omitted for cross-validation19 in DM and, later, in refinement. An initial model was constructed using the molecular graph-

ics program O.20 At this stage some amino-acid residues at the N- and C-termini of the protein and in the loop regions could not be interpreted, but most of these comprising the core of the protein could be determined clearly from the map. Two breaks in the chains of each molecule were observed at positions 15 and 31 in molecule A and 15 and 32 in molecule B. The molecule was subjected to simulated annealing and interactive cycles of positional and temperature factor refinement followed by manual fitting and rebuilding. All refinement procedures employed the maximum likelihood amplitude target in CNS.21 Extending the resolution to 2.3 Å made the identification of most amino acids possible according to the sequences of molecules A and B. From the Fourier ( 2Fo Fc ) and difference Fourier ( Fo Fc ) maps, two Zn2 ions were identified, one at the interface

near the C-terminal regions of both molecules and one on the surface of molecule A. A characteristic nonprotein density was observed in the difference Fourier map at 2.5 in the substrate-binding region of molecule A (Fig. 1). A molecule of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) was modeled into it very clearly. Water molecules were assigned to peaks at a contour greater than 3 that were within hydrogen bonding distances from the potential partners. An unusually strong and continuous electron density in both ( 2Fo Fc ) and ( Fo Fc ) maps was also present between the calcium-binding loop and an a-helical segment containing residues 40 to 55 seemingly connecting residues Gly32 (mutated to Cys 32) and Asp 49 (mutated to Cys 49) (Fig. 2). The N-terminal sequence determination and the complete amino-acid sequence determination have indicated the presence of Cys residues at position 32 and 49 in molecule A. Further refinement of the model containing two zinc ions, one NAG molecule, Cys 32 instead of Gly 32, and Cys 49 instead of Asp 49 in molecule A, and water molecules dropped the R and Rfree values by 3%.

molecule A are among the most significant mutations reported so far in the PLA2 sequences. The sequence of molecule B, on the other hand, is very similar to those of other group I PLA2s except an unusual deletion of the conserved Gly 32. The two molecules share an overall 81% sequence identity (Fig. 3). Estimation of Thiol Groups The estimations of thiol groups from the observed maximum absorbance at 412 nm gave a value of approximately 14.9 disulfide bonds per dimeric molecule, thus accounting for a total of 15 disulphide bridges: 8 disulfide bridges in molecule A and 7 in molecule B. Presence of NAG in the Crystals The molecular mass of protein samples was determined with MALDI-TOF using crystals as samples for analysis. Two peaks were observed that corresponded to molecular masses of 13282.8 Da and 12706.4 Da. The molecular mass of molecules A and B estimated from the amino-acid sequences were 13061.5 Da and 12705.2 Da, respectively. The excess mass of molecule A from the crystal was 221.3 Da. This was equal to the molecular mass of NAG (MW @ 221.0) calculated from its formula (C8N1O6H15). Molecular Association The results of dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments gave a mean hydrodynamic radius (RH) of 1.85 0.08 nm without zinc ions. In the presence of zinc ions, the RH value was found to be 2.71 0.09 nm. The RH values of 1.85 nm and 2.71 nm correspond to proteins of molecular weights with approximately 14 kDa and 28 kDa respectively.25,26 Because the polydispersity values in these estimates were below 15% of the average radii, all PLA2 molecular configurations are expected to be monodisperse at both experimental conditions. This means that in samples without zinc ions PLA2 exists as a monomer, whereas it forms a heterodimer in the presence of zinc ion. Effects of Zinc Ion on the Activity of PLA2 The calcium ion is known to bind to PLA2 in the calcium-binding loop and plays both structural and ionic roles in the activation of PLA2. It has been observed that other metal ions are unable to bind to PLA2 effectively in the calcium-binding loop27 and hence fail to activate the enzyme with equal efficiency.27 The Zn2 and Ca2 ions have also been shown to promote the dimerization of various isoforms of PLA2s.17,28 The consequences of dimerization on the enzymatic function of PLA2 have been determined.17,28 They showed that the metal induced dimerization produced orientations of monomers in which substrate-binding sites were found occluded. The position of Zn2 ion and the orientations of monomers in the present structure are very similar to those reported earlier.17,28 However, the orientations of amino acids involved in the coordination with the interfacial metal ions are considerably different. The calcium ion coordination involves five oxygen atoms from protein ligands and two from water molecules and forms a sevenfold coordination

geometry of the dimeric model indicated the convergence of refinement. The refinement was stopped when no further improvement to Rfree was made. The refinement statistics are given in Table II. The current dimer model contains 1784 protein atoms from molecule A (Cys PLA2) and molecule B (PLA2), 2 Zn2 , 1 molecule of NAG, and 245 water molecules. Data Bank Accession Numbers The complementary DNA sequences for the two molecules from Naja naja sagittifera have been deposited in the Gen Bank with accession numbers AY862399 and AY862400 for Cys PLA2 (molecule A) and group I PLA2 (molecule B), respectively. The final refined coordinates of the structure are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a code 1Y75. All the figures were drawn using the program Swiss PDB Viewer.22 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Sequence Analysis The cDNA sequences of the two molecules, referred to hereafter as molecules A and B, contain 378 base pairs each. These sequences are comprised of 21 nucleotides from the signal sequence and 354 nucleotides encoding for 118 amino-acid residues of the mature protein in each molecule along with the stop codon. The numbering schemes in the mature sequences of the two molecules are from Asn 1 to Asn 120 and Asn 1 to Gln 120 with two deletions at positions 16 and 31 in molecule A and positions 16 and 32 in molecule B. The positions 31 and 32 are part of the highly conserved calcium-binding loops. Therefore, the effects of these deletions are expected to be directly related to the calcium-binding capabilities of monomers as well as the enzyme activity. Furthermore, the mutations of Gly 32 to Cys 32 and Asp 49 to Cys 49 in

with distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry.17 On the other hand, in the earlier structure of zinc dimer, the zinc ion was coordinated through three oxygen atoms from protein residues and two from water molecules, resulting in a regular fivefold coordination.28 In the present structure, zinc ions also form a fivefold coordination, but all the oxygen atoms are from protein residues. As compared to

the previous structures, the coordination distances in the present structure are slightly longer. Quality of the Model The final model consists of a heterodimer formed between Cys­PLA2, which is designated as molecule A, and a group I PLA2, designated as molecule B. Molecule A

contains amino acids from Asn 1 to Asn 120 with two deletions at positions 16 and 31, while molecule B has an equal number of amino-acid residues from Asn 1 to Gln 120, also with two deletions at positions 16 and 32. The structure contains 1784 protein atoms, 2 zinc ions, 1 molecule of NAG bound in the hydrophobic channel of molecule A, and 244 water molecules. The 2Fo Fc electron density map is continuous and well defined for both the backbone and the side chains. The root-meansquare deviations in bond lengths and angles were 0.008 Å and 1.4°, respectively. As calculated using PROCHECK,29 87.7% of the nonglycine residues fall in the most allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.30 The refinement statistics are given in Table II. Overall Structure The molecular topology of both monomers conserves all main features of the PLA2 type of folding (Fig. 4). The N-terminal helix (H1) runs from residues 2 to 12. Helix 2 (H2) extends from residues 40 to 55 and the helix 3 (H3) spans residues 85 to 103. The structure also contains a double-stranded antiparallel -wing (residues 70 ­73 and 77­79). There are two helical turns involving residues 19 to 22 (SH4) and residues 110 to 112 (SH5). The backbone conformations of both molecules are also very similar. The root-mean-square displacement for the Ca atoms of the two chains is 0.73 Å. Notable differences are observed in the conformations of calcium-binding loops, some surface loops, b-wings, and the C-terminal regions. Detection of a New S­S Bridge PLA2s are classified into various groups based on specific parameters such as molecular size and numbers and locations of disulfide bridges. Although several classes of PLA2s are described, the most extensively studied PLA2s are those of groups I and II. These are present mainly in the snake venoms, mammalian pancreatic juices, synovial fluid, sperm, and platelets.1,31­33 The catalytic function of PLA2 involves specifically the release of fatty acids from the sn-2 position of phospholipids. It is well known that PLA2s generally require Ca2 ion for the catalytic function. The group I PLA2s typically contain 115 to 120 amino-acid residues while the PLA2s of group II have 120 to 125 amino-acid residues. The PLA2s of both groups are characterized with seven disulfide bridges, although the positions of two cysteine residues are different. According to the number of residues and the sequence identities of molecules A and B, both molecules belong to the family of group I PLA2s. The observations of two novel mutations in molecule A at highly conserved positions 32 and 49 that are invariably occupied by Gly and Asp indicate considerable influence on its structure and function. It may be noted that Gly at 32 imparts flexibility to the calciumbinding loop, which in turn facilitates the binding of Ca2 ion. The resulting shape of the calcium-binding loop together with calcium ion contributes to the substrate binding and hydrolysis. Similarly, Asp 49 plays an important role in the binding of Ca2 and in imparting stereochemical support to the catalytic residues. In addition, the

covalent linkage between the calcium-binding loop and helix H2 through Cys 32 and Cys 49 further alters the stereochemistry of the substrate-binding channel. This new disulfide bridge is observed for the first time in this family of proteins. It imparts considerable rigidity to the structure of molecule A in which H2 helix (residues 44 ­55) stands like a pole holding various parts of the molecule through four disulfide bridges, Cys 44 ­Cys100, Cys 45­ Cys29, Cys 49 ­Cys 32, and Cys 51­Cys 93 that act like strings. It is a rare observation where a small segment of protein with just seven amino acids contributes to four disulphide bonds. Calcium-Binding Loop It is generally observed that calcium is required for the catalytic function of PLA2 enzymes,34,35 although there have been a few instances where PLA2 activity has been reported without Ca2 .8,23,36 There is also a unique requirement of a structure in the protein for an efficient binding of the calcium ion. PLA2 molecules contain a favorable environment for calcium binding. Therefore, calcium is easily trapped in a loop, Tyr 25­Gly 33 that contains four glycine residues at positions 26, 30, 32, and 33, and two Cys residues at positions 27 and 29. The calcium ion is coordinated by three main chain oxygen atoms from residues 28, 30, and 32, and two carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp 49. Two generally conserved solvent water molecules complete the coordination sphere of the calcium ion forming a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. It is believed that two disulfide bridges Cys 27­Cys 119 and Cys 29 ­Cys 45 ensure the correct relative orientation of the calciumbinding loop in relation to the amino acids of the catalytic network. The presence of four Gly residues in the loop provides the necessary conformational flexibility to facilitate the interactions of three main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms. In the present structure, the calcium-binding loop of molecule A has three glycines and three cysteines instead of four glycines and two cysteines and one deletion of residue at position 31. A deletion is also observed in the calcium-binding loop of molecule B at position 32. The conformations of calcium-binding loops in molecules A and B are significantly different from each other [Fig. 5(a)]. Both are also considerably different from the conformations of calcium-binding loops observed in other group I PLA2s [Fig. 5(b)]. Binding of N-Acetylglucosamine (NAG) Chemical studies have shown the presence of carbohydrate in the crystals. A remarkably good quality electron density in the substrate-binding site of molecule A has allowed us to model one N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) molecule. It is located deep inside the substrate-binding cleft (Fig. 1). The corresponding region in molecule B is empty. As seen from Figure 6, NAG is held firmly in the substratebinding site with four hydrogen bonds. Lys 64 Nz forms a hydrogen bond with NAG O1. O1 forms another hydrogen bond with OW 47. In turn, OW 47 interacts with Tyr 52 OH and Thr 2 OH. OH (4) of NAG is involved in a hydrogen bond with Phe 22 O. O5 and O6 interact with His 48

through a water molecule OW 1. In addition to these hydrogen bonds, the side chains of Phe 5, Trp 19, and Phe 22 are at appropriate distances to give rise to several van der Waals interactions. The presence of NAG in the substrate-binding site of molecule A and its participation in a number of interactions clearly demonstrate the carbohydrate recognition potential of molecule A. Structure of the Dimer The dimer induced by Zn2 contains Cys­PLA2 (molecule A) and a group I PLA2 (molecule B). It is stable both in solid state as well as in solution (DLS studies). The Zn2 at the interface of two monomers forms fivefold coordination through two carboxylic oxygen atoms from Asp 24 of molecule A as well as from Asp 24 of molecule B. Od1 atom of Asn 112 (molecule A) completes the coordination sphere of the Zn2 ion forming a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. A second zinc ion has been observed at the surface of molecule A that interacts with Glu 71 of molecule A, its symmetry related Glu 71 and two main chain oxygen atoms, also of symmetry related Asn 120. Molecules A and B are so arranged that an approximate twofold noncrystallographic symmetry axis passes through the interface via zinc ion (Fig. 4). In comparison, the present heterodimer shows a good match with the zinc dimer reported earlier from Naja naja sagittifera.27 The electrostatic interaction involving Arg 62 (molecule A) and Glu 56 (molecule B) observed in the previous zinc dimer is absent in the present dimer as Glu 56 is mutated to Gly 56 in molecule

B. Other important interactions such as Asp 49 (molecule A) O 2­Arg 31 (molecule B) NH2, Arg 31 (molecule A) NH1­Cys 29 (molecule B) O observed in zinc dimer are also absent in the present dimer. Molecular Packing The novel heterodimer is crystallized in space group P41212 and the asymmetric part of the unit cell contains molecules A and B, one molecule of NAG and two zinc ions, one at the interface and the second on the surface of molecule A. The protein molecules in the crystal are tightly packed. In addition to strong intermolecular coordination linkages through zinc ion, there are at least 14 hydrogen bonds and 34 van der Waals interactions between neighboring molecules. The stacking of the molecules was very tight, resulting in one of the lowest solvent contents (33%) observed so far for a PLA2 structure. The contributions of the density of packing to the crystal quality should in principle be visible in terms of high resolution and low B-factors. However, the resolution was not very high (2.3 Å) and the B-factors were found on the higher side (B average 48.2 Å2) among various PLA2 23,37,38 structures. Also, the mosaicity with value of 1.1° was considerably high, indicating no direct relationship with solvent content. In principle, the crystal quality should have improved with denser packing because the protein molecules are less exposed to solvent and their side chains are more restricted in movement. In the present heterodimer, the two molecules are held tightly only at one

end while the lack of interactions on the other end of the interface provides a lot of scope for the monomers to oscillate with respect to each other, thus generating a conformational heterogeneity resulting in a comparatively poor resolution and high B-factors. Therefore, this structure provides a good example of the solvent content not always being directly related to the quality of the crystals.
