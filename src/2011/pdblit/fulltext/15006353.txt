Molecular details of formin-mediated actin assembly
David R Kovar
Formins are a large family of multi-domain polypeptides that form homodimers. The highly conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domain and its neighboring formin homology 1 (FH1) domain, which are surrounded by regulatory domains, cooperate in rapidly assembling profilin­actin into long filaments while remaining continuously associated with the fast-growing barbed end. Recent biochemical, biophysical, theoretical and structural studies have concluded that diverse formins are mechanistically similar, but that the rates of various assembly states differ quantitatively, and have shed light on the mechanism of formin auto-regulation and activation by Rho GTPases.

protein [9­12] while simultaneously directing the addition of profilin­actin to the barbed end at rates up to 5­10fold faster than free actin [8]. Here I discuss recent studies that have shed light on the molecular mechanism(s) of formin-mediated actin assembly and the regulation of formins.

Formin-mediated actin assembly
Formins are large multi-domain proteins (Figure 1a) required for the assembly of the actin filaments found in the cytokinetic contractile ring, yeast actin cables, adherens junctions between epithelial cells and filopodial protrusions [13­20]. The defining feature of formin is the $400 residue FH2 domain [21] and the adjacent variablelength proline-rich FH1 domain near the C terminus (Figure 1a), which cooperatively mediate actin filament assembly. A crystal structure shows that the FH2 domain from budding yeast Bni1p forms a stable, but flexible, dimeric `donut' (Figure 1b) [22]. The FH2 domain is necessary and sufficient to nucleate actin filament assembly [4,23] and to bind with low nM affinity [4] and remain continually associated (processive) with the fast-growing barbed end (Figure 2a) [6­8,9,10]. Processive barbedend association explains the general properties of all formin FH2 domains studied: formins do not affect the rate of pointed end elongation/depolymerization, variably reduce the rate of barbed end elongation/depolymerization (Figure 2b), and allow barbed ends to elongate in the presence of barbed-end capping proteins. How FH2 remains continually associated with the elongating barbed end is an outstanding question. Most schematic models [8,9­11,22] predict that each half of the FH2 homodimer interacts with only one actin subunit (one half with the ultimate subunit and the other with the penultimate subunit) and that it `stair steps' with the elongating barbed end. Models that require dissociation of the trailing FH2 half from the penultimate actin subunit to provide space for addition of the next actin subunit do not easily explain how FH2 domains can keep up with a rapid elongation rate (at least 100 subunits/s) [8], how they remain processive during the addition of tens of thousands of subunits [7,8], or why they do not appear to rotate on the barbed end of the elongating filament [7]. A remarkable co-crystal of Bni1 FH2 associated with tetramethyl-rhodamine-labeled actin (TMR actin) demonstrates that flexibility in the FH2 dimer permits the actin filament to sit inside the `donut hole' [24], allowing each half of the FH2 dimer to

Introduction
Cells maintain a large reserve of actin monomers bound to profilin [1]. Since profilin­actin cannot add to the pointed end, actin filaments with free barbed ends are required for rapid assembly. New filaments are created primarily by an expanding list of mechanistically different nucleating proteins. Spire binds and stabilizes the pointed end, leaving the barbed end free to elongate [2]. Arp2/3 complex binds to the side of a mother filament and initiates a branch by mimicking the pointed end of a new daughter filament. Pointed-end-associated nucleators are not ideal for making long filaments because the free barbed ends are rapidly bound by capping proteins that block monomer addition [3]. How then can filaments become long without being capped, a requirement for several actinbased structures? A fascinating solution to this conundrum is provided by formin, which nucleates [4,5] and then remains continuously (processively) associated with the elongating barbed end [6­8]. Processive barbed end association of formin allows protection from capping

Structural, biochemical and mechanistic insights into mDia1 regulation. (a) Domain organization of mouse formin mDia1. G, region necessary for binding Rho GTP-ase (Rho) [38,39,40]; DID, diaphanous inhibitory domain [38]; DD, dimerization domain [39,40]; FH1 and FH2, formin homology domains; DAD, diaphanous auto-regulatory domain [42,43]. Regulatory domains flank FH1 and FH2, which mediate actin filament assembly. Association of the C-terminal DAD with the N-terminal DID inhibits the FH2. Rho-GTPase activates FH2 by associating with the G and DID, resulting in dissociation of the DAD. (b) Schematic representation of formin domain structures. Crystal structures show that both the mDia1 N-terminal G, DID and DD domains (left) [39,40] and the budding yeast Bni1p C-terminal FH2 domain (middle) [22] dimerize. A full-length formin `homodimer' (right) might consist of a flexible proline-rich FH1 domain tethered at either end to dimerization domains. (c) Schematics of mDia1 regulation. Left: a typical model for autoinhibition of an mDia1 monomer via DAD­DID interaction, relieved (activated) by association of Rho-GTPase to residues within the G and DID [39].

interact with two actin subunits at the end of the filament (a total of three subunits are bound since the penultimate subunit is bound by both FH2 molecules). This configuration allows both FH2 halves to remain continuously bound during subunit addition because only one of the two

Formin-mediated actin filament elongation. (a) Continual (processive) attachment of formin FH1FH2 constructs (fission yeast Cdc12, budding yeast Bni1, mouse mDia1 and mDia2) to growing barbed ends has been directly demonstrated by observing filament elongation from formin immobilized on microscope slides [6,7] (Kovar et al., unpublished) and polystyrene beads [8]. Filaments do not dissociate from formin during the incorporation of thousands of actin or profilin actin subunits. When immobilized NEM-myosin captures a filament growing from an immobilized formin, piconewton forces from polymerization buckle the filament, as observed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy [7]. Scale bar represents 5 mm. (b) Formins have dramatic effects on the rate of elongation. In the absence of profilin, formins reduce the elongation rate, compared to free barbed ends, variously from $100% inhibition (fission yeast Cdc12) to $0% inhibition (mouse mDia1). Profilin increases the elongation rate of all formin-associated barbed-ends [7,8]. (c) Although the rates of particular steps vary, the general mechanism is conserved between formins. Continual attachment of formin with the elongating actin filament barbed end is dependent upon the FH2 dimer, which encircles the filament end like a donut [24]. The FH2 dimer is in rapid equilibrium (Ko/c) between a `closed' (left) and an `open' (right) state. The equilibrium constants vary among formins, ranging from mostly capped for fission yeast Cdc12p (Ko/c = 0.01) to mostly open for mouse mDia1 (Ko/c = 1.0). Although profilin and profilin­actin can bind to the proline-rich FH1 domain in both states (pathways 4 and 5), actin or profilin­actin can add to the barbed end only when the FH2 dimer is `open' (pathways 1­3). Free profilin­actin (pathway 2) adds at only a third the rate of free actin (pathway 1). Profilin­actin associated with the flexible FH1 domain can assemble up to 5­10-fold faster than free actin (pathway 3).

filaments that do not accumulate torsion stresses and supercoil [26]. Structural and biochemical experiments provide a working model that the FH2 dimer exists in equilibrium between a `closed' state, which does not allow subunit addition, and an `open' state (Figure 2c) [24]. Transition from `closed' to `open' involves movement of the lagging unit of the FH2 dimer towards the barbed end, causing the two subunits of the FH2 dimer to exchange roles [24]. These transitions must occur quickly since elongation rates in the presence of formin increase linearly with actin concentration [9]. FH2 domains reduce the rate of barbed end elongation (compared with a free barbed end), but the magnitude of the effect varies among formins [7,8,9­11,23,24,27,28], suggesting that the equilibrium between open and closed (Ko/c) varies among formins (Figure 2b and c). Fission yeast Cdc12 completely blocks elongation (Ko/c 0.01), mouse FRL1 and mDia2 slow elongation by $80% (Ko/ c = 0.2), budding yeast Bni1 slows elongation by $50% (Ko/c = 0.5), and mouse mDia1 has little effect on elongation (Ko/c ! 0.9). In addition to Ko/c, the rate of actin addition and/or subtraction from the barbed end in the `open' state might also contribute to differences in elongation rates in the presence of various formin FH2 domains. Flexible FH1 domains, characterized by short runs of consecutive proline residues that bind profilin with low mM affinity [13], are adjacent to the FH2 domain (Figure 1a). Both the number of profilin binding sites (1­16) and the affinity of each site may vary widely. Nevertheless, for all formin FH1FH2 constructs studied, profilin increases the barbed end elongation rate (Figure 2b) [7,8,27] (Kovar et al., unpublished), provided that profilin can interact with both actin and FH1 [5,23,27]. The magnitude of the increase depends on both the particular formin and the concentration of profilin (Kovar et al., unpublished). At optimal profilin concentrations the elongation rate for all formins is higher than control filaments, up to $5­10-fold higher for mouse mDia1 [8]. The most dramatic effect is with fission yeast Cdc12, since the barbed end elongation rate increases infinitely from $0.0 mMÀ1 secÀ1 in the absence of profilin to 12.5 mMÀ1 secÀ1 (1.25-fold higher than free barbed ends) in the presence of profilin. At higher concentrations of profilin the elongation rate is lower, owing to free profilin competing with profilin­actin for binding to FH1 sites. Mechanisms that may contribute to profilin's effect include the following: profilin­actin binding to FH1 (at least for fission yeast Cdc12p), which may increase Ko/c (the open/closed equilibrium); tethering profilin­actin to FH1, which might increase the probability that actin is oriented favorably for binding to the barbed end; and raising the local concentration of profilin­actin several orders of magnitude.
Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2006, 18:11­17

The emerging model is that although the parameters of particular reactions (i.e. Ko/c and the magnitude of profilin enhancement) vary between formins, the general mechanism is conserved (Figure 2c). Many details remain to be worked out. For example, the mechanism by which FH2 `walks' along the barbed end is not understood in any detail. Also the role of actin's ATP in forminmediated elongation is in dispute. In one study, profilin was shown to inhibit the elongation of actin filaments associated with mouse mDia1 in the presence of nonhydrolysable Mg-AMP-PNP, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is required for processivity [8], whereas in another study four formins (including mouse mDia1) were found to remain processively associated with elongating ADP­ actin in both the absence and presence of profilin (Kovar et al., unpublished). It is also important to characterize additional formins within and between organisms to test for mechanistic differences. A plant formin FH2 domain completely inhibits barbed end elongation, whereas the corresponding FH1FH2 construct allows barbed elongation even in the absence of profilin [29]. Additionally, the nucleating activity of budding yeast Bni1, but not budding yeast Bnr1, is increased by the cell polarity factor Bud6/Aip3 [30].

Regulation of formins
Why do most organisms have multiple (two in budding yeast; six in Drosophila; 15 in mammals) formin isoforms? Although it is possible that quantitative differences in actin filament elongation rates are physiologically relevant, the simplest hypothesis is that cells require formins that are differentially regulated. For example, fission yeast contains three formin isoforms, each of which localizes differentially and assembles actin filaments required for distinct cellular processes [13,15,31,32]. Similarly, the two budding yeast formins Bni1 and Bnr1 (Figure 3a), as well as the mouse and Dictyostelium formins mDia2 and dDia2 (Figure 3b), assemble actin filaments required for unique actin structures [17,19,33­35]. The actin assembly FH1FH2 domains are flanked on either side by regulatory domains (Figure 1a) that are less well conserved. Diaphanous-related formins are regulated by auto-inhibition through interaction between the N and C termini (Figure 1a and c). Rho GTPase binding to the N-terminal region activates formins by releasing the FH1FH2-domain-containing C terminus [36,37]. Exciting work has recently shed light on structural and biochemical details of the mechanism of mouse formin mDia1 auto-regulation [38,39,40]. The Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD) is a stretch of 20­30 amino acids found C-terminal to the FH2 domain (Figure 1a) that binds with sub-mM affinity to the diaphanous inhibitor domain (DID) [38], a $250 residue region located near the N terminus. DAD­DID interaction is sufficient

Differential regulation allows formins to manufacture long filaments that are crosslinked into polar bundles at specific cellular locations. (a) In budding yeast, by localizing to the bud neck and bud tip, formins Bnr1 and Bni1 assemble polarized actin cables whose barbed ends are oriented for myosin-V directed delivery of vesicles and organelles to the division site and expanding bud tip (schematic based on diagrams by Tony Bretscher and colleagues, Cornell University). (b) At the leading edge of a motile cell, mouse mDia2 [17] and Dictyostelium dDia2 [19] are required for filopodium formation, suggesting that locally activated mDia2/dDia2 allow barbed end elongation of a subset of Arp2/3 complex branched actin filaments (schematic based on a similar model postulated for VASP [44,45]).

for auto-inhibition. Two crystal structures show that the DID folds into five armadillo repeats and that residues immediately following the DID domain (the dimerization domain or DD) form a highly stable homodimer [39,40]. Rho GTPase activates mDia1 by binding with low mM affinity to a region that comprises both a portion of DID (which overlaps with the DAD­DID interaction) and a G domain (residues upstream of DID that are required for GTP-ase binding) [38,39,40]. Therefore, although association of Rho and DAD with the regulatory region of mDia1 are mutually exclusive, their binding sites only partially overlap, a common theme for autoinhibitory regulation of Ras GTPase effectors [40]. A co-crystal of RhoC in complex with G­DID­DD shows that two RhoC molecules associate with the G­DID­DD homodimer via the Rho `switch' regions [39]. Given that full-length formin probably forms a stable dimer that is coupled near both the N terminus (DD) and the C terminus (FH2) (Figure 1b), details of mDia1 regulation might be more complicated than currently

appreciated (Figure 1c). Other diaphanous-related formins, which contain DAD and DID sequences and are regulated by Rho GTPases [41], probably have a similar mechanism to mDia1. However, many formins do not contain obvious DAD and DID sequences [36,37], so their mode of regulation is certain to be different.

Conclusions
Formins are remarkable machines that allow the rapid assembly of profilin­actin into long polarized unbranched actin filaments in a spatial and temporally regulated fashion. By employing a domain-by-domain approach, rapid progress has been made towards understanding the molecular mechanism(s) of formin regulation and forminmediated actin assembly. We are now beginning to understand that although formins are variously regulated, their mechanism for actin assembly is conserved even though the rates of particular reactions are quantitatively different. However, we must test whether full-length formins retain the same molecular characteristics. Given their size

(typically > 1000 residues) and low abundance this will not be a trivial endeavor. Additionally, many fascinating questions remain. What are the structural arrangements of the `open' and `closed' states on the barbed end, and what are the bases for intrinsic differences between diverse FH2 domains? How does profilin increase the rate of elongation beyond the diffusion limit? Are differences between formins in their Ko/c (equilibrium between `open' and `closed' states) and in the extent to which profilin enhances their barbed end elongation physiologically relevant? Finally, given that many organisms contain multiple profilin isoforms, does the particular profilin isoform affect the rate of barbed end elongation?
