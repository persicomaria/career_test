ABSTRACT Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is a gastrointestinal incretin hormone, which modulates physiological insulin secretion. Because of its glucose-sensitive insulinotropic activity, there has been a considerable interest in utilizing the hormone as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes. Structural parameters obtained from NMR spectroscopy combined with molecular modeling techniques play a vital role in the design of new therapeutic drugs. Therefore, to understand the structural requirements for the biological activity of GIP, the solution structure of GIP was investigated by circular dichroism (CD) followed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. CD studies showed an increase in the helical character of the peptide with increasing concentration of trifluoroethanol (TFE) up to 50%. Therefore, the solution structure of GIP in 50% TFE was determined. It was found that there was an a-helix between residues 6 and 29, which tends to extend further up to residue 36. The implications of the C-terminal extended helical segment in the inhibitory properties of GIP on gastric acid secretion are discussed. It is shown that the adoption by GIP of an a-helical secondary structure is a requirement for its biological activity. Knowledge of the solution structure of GIP will help in the understanding of how the peptide interacts with its receptor and aids in the design of new therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of diabetes.

trimeric G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) located on the pancreatic b cell.3 GIP(1­30)amide shows a similar insulin-secreting activity to that of the native GIP; however, its somatostatinotropic activity is greatly reduced when compared with the parent peptide.4 Human GIP results from proteolytic cleavage of the 153 residue precursor preproGIP, giving rise to a 51 amino acid N-terminal fragment, a 42 amino acid middle section that is GIP, and a 60 amino acid segment at the C terminus. GIP-receptors have been located at various extrapancreatic sites including the gut, adipose tissue, heart, adrenal cortex, and the brain.5 Because of its glucose-lowering and insulinotropic properties, which are active only under hyperglycaemic conditions, GIP is being considered as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, the rapid degradation of GIP in the circulation has led to the development of various analogs to prolong the half-life of GIP in plasma.6 Identification of the structural features and study of biological properties of the GIP family of peptides are vital in understanding structure-activity relationships. There have been numerous biological studies carried out on GIP in an attempt to elucidate the bioactive domains of the molecule.2,6­12 Until recently, the threedimensional structure remained unknown. In this article, we present the three-dimensional solution structure of GIP (YAEGTFISDYSIAMDKIHQQDFVNWLLAQKGKKNDWKHNITQ) in a 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)-d3:H2O solvent mixture, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular modeling.

with increasing concentrations of TFE. The optimum helical content was achieved when using equimolar concentrations of TFE and water as a solvent. GIP, under the aqueous conditions used, adopts a stable a-helical conformation between residues Phe6 and Gln29 and a less well-defined extended helical segment between residues Lys30 and Trp36. The latter could account for the somatostatinotropic activity shown by GIP. The results presented here provide a valuable insight into the structural and functional properties of the native GIP, which should help in the design of novel peptidic drugs active at the GIP receptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis and Sequence Analysis of GIP Human GIP was sequentially synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 432A automated peptide synthesizer using standard solid-phase N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) procedure, starting from an Fmoc-Gln-Wang resin as described previously.13 The peptide was purified to homogeneity by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and structural identity confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.12 The hydrophilicity of the peptide was predicted using the Hopp & Woods scale14 using ProtScale.15 Peptide sequence similarity and conservation was respectively analyzed with FASTA16 and Jalview17 using the Clustal X color scheme.18 CD Spectroscopy CD spectra were obtained in the far-UV region (180­ 250 nm) on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. GIP samples were dissolved in water or in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and TFE. The final concentration of TFE was 10, 20, 33, 50, and 70% TFE for each buffered and unbuffered sample. The concentration of the peptide was 30 lM and was calculated using the UV absorbance at 280 nm. CD experiments were carried out using a response time of 2 s, a scanning speed of 50 nm/min, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and data pitch of 0.2 nm. All spectra were acquired at 208C by accumulation of 15 scans in a 0.1-cm cell, and corrected for baseline contributions. Calculation of the helical content was performed with the program K2D19 using the DICHROWEB web interface.20,21 NMR Spectroscopy NMR experiments were performed using a 5-mm inverse probehead with Bruker DRX 500, 800, and 900 NMR spectrometers operating at a 1H resonance frequency of 500.13, 800.13, and 900.27 MHz, respectively, at 298 K. The peptide samples of GIP (2 mM) were dissolved in 1:1 mixture of TFE-d3:H2O (600 lL). One-dimensional proton NMR spectra were acquired with a standard parameter set. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive doublequantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY),22 total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY),23 and nuclear

Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY)24 data sets were acquired with a relaxation delay of 1.4 s, acquisition time of 0.40 s, and a spectral width of 10 kHz. The TOCSY data were acquired with 30 and 80 ms mixing times, whereas the NOESY data were acquired with a 200-ms mixing time. The experiments were performed with 16, 8, and 16 transients for each of 2048 t1 increments into 8192 complex data points for the DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY data, respectively. 2D data were zero-filled to 4096 data points in F1 prior to transformation. All data sets were apodized in both dimensions using a shifted squared sinebell window function. All spectra were referenced internally to the residual 1H signal of F3CCDHOD, resonating at 3.98 ppm and TSP at 0 ppm, where necessary. Data were acquired and processed using the Bruker XWINNMR program (version 3.5). Structure Calculations 2D NMR spectra were analyzed and the spectral integration of the NOESY peaks were done using the SPARKY software version 3.110.25 NOESY peak volume integrals were converted into distance constraints by calibrating of nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) intensity versus distance bonds routine of backbone, flexible side-chain, and methyl proton classes with CALIBA.26 Pseudoatoms were introduced for the protons, which could not be stereospecifically assigned.27 Distance constraints involving fixed distances as well as those limits that could not be violated were regarded as irrelevant by the CYANA program. A set of constraints was thus obtained with upper distance limits as input for further calculations. Torsional angle constraints in the À908 to À408 range were also included for 3JHNHa < 6.0 Hz. Structure calculations were carried out using the CYANA program (version 1.0.6).28 Distance and torsional constraints were used as input to CYANA. Two hundred structures were randomly generated and energy minimized in CYANA, including 10,000 steps of simulated annealing, as well as 5,000 steps of conjugate-gradient minimisation. During the CYANA calculations, distance and torsional constraints were weighted using the force ° constants kNOE ¼ 1 kJ molÀ1 AÀ2 and kDihed_c ¼ 5 kJ molÀ1 degÀ2, respectively. Finally, the 20 structures with lowest target function values were subjected to 1000 steps of unconstrained Powell minimization using the Tripos force field within SYBYL (version 6.8.1).29 The Biopolymer module of TRIPOS software29 and the MOLMOL30 (version 2K.2) graphics packages were used for final structure analysis. MOLMOL and PyMOL (version 0.99)31 were used for structure representation. RESULTS CD spectroscopic studies of GIP revealed that, regardless of the presence or absence of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, the helicity of the peptide was enhanced with increasing amounts of TFE, up to a concentration of 50%. GIP samples with a TFE concentration of 70% resulted in no additional increase in the helical content of GIP (Fig. 1).

Standard NMR experiments, 1D proton, TOCSY, DQF COSY, and NOESY, were used for the identification of proton resonances. The fingerprint region of the DQF-COSY spectrum showed 43 crosspeaks in the NH/aH region, including two peaks for each of the aH resonances of the two Gly residues. Alanine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, and valine residues were used as starting points for the identification of sequence-specific resonance assignments. The reliability of the resonance assignments was supported by the observation in the NOESY spectrum of amide proton connectivities between neighboring amino acid residues (Fig. 2). Clear, strong aiH/Niþ3H medium-range connectivities were observed for residues Glu3 through to Asp35 as well as weak connectivities for residues Lys37 and His38. Strong NiH/Niþ1H backbone connectivities were observed for most of the residues. The N-terminal
PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

residues up to Phe6 and C-terminal residues beyond Gln29 showed strong aiH/Niþ1H short-range resonances, whereas weaker aiH/Niþ1H connectivities were found for the remaining residues, Phe6-Gln29. The strong aiH/ biþ3H medium-range connectivities observed for residues Glu3-Gln29 of the NOESY spectrum confirmed the helical nature of the peptide. The structural constraints obtained from the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 3) and the 3JHNHa couplings extracted from the DQF­COSY spectrum were used for structure calculation. Two hundred structures were generated from the computer modelling and the 20 structures with lowest target function value were used for further studies. These structures were in good agreement with the experimentally derived constraints as shown by the calculated low target function value of 0.70 Æ 0.14. The main structural character of the peptide was a highlyordered, right-handed a-helix, between residues Phe6Gln29. The NMR data and structure calculation studies revealed that the helix spans further towards the C terminus, the segment between residues Lys30-Trp36 showing a weaker, less well-defined helix. The C-terminal region of the peptide, Lys37-Gln42, showed a random coil conformation. The low root mean square deviation (RMSD) value obtained upon best fit superposition of the structures between residues Phe6-Gln29 was 0.24 Æ 0.06 for backbone atoms (Table I; Fig. 4), an indication that

the calculated structures remain within one family of conformations. The Hopp­Woods hydrophilicity plot, in which regions of the peptide with values greater than zero are regarded as hydrophilic, is shown in Figure 5. The sequence similarity of GIP with members of the glucagon family, including the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist exendin-4, has been studied with FASTA (Table II). The N termini and the area between residues 22 and 26 are remarkably well conserved (Fig. 6). DISCUSSION The importance of the pharmacological antidiabetic properties of GIP has made the structural and biological studies of GIP and its analogs a subject of intense interest. Although an aqueous environment favors the natural formation of proteins and larger peptides, NMR studies of small polypeptides show few or no regular secondary structural features in water. Therefore, less polar solvents, such as methanol, acetonitrile, and TFE have been used extensively in NMR and structural studies of biologically important molecules.32­34 Such solvents form fewer hydrogen bonds than water and so they promote the formation of internal hydrogen bonds in the solute. The fact that the ability of GIP(1-30)amide to stimulate the secretion of somatostatin is reduced, in comparison

with the native GIP,4 led us to analyze the C-terminal end of the peptide (Lys30-Gln42) in search for elements of secondary structure that could account for such biological action. Since the C terminus was found to adopt a mainly random coil conformation in water,35 aqueous TFE was used. TFE has been shown to promote the formation and stabilization of helical regions and b-hairpins in polypeptides with an intrinsic propensity to do so in their native state.36­38 The use of TFE allowed us to compare the structure of GIP with similar peptidic hormones (manuscript in preparation).

Previous conformational studies performed by only CD spectroscopic methods have shown that the helical content of GIP in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 was increased dramatically, 11­79%, for a sample containing 40% TFE.39 Our present CD and NMR studies of GIP, carried out under similar conditions, confirmed these findings. In addition, we have found that increasing concentrations of TFE result in an increase in the helical content of GIP, regardless of the presence, or absence of buffer in the samples. We have also observed that there seemed to be no additional increase in helicity at concentrations of TFE above 50% (Fig. 1). Therefore, the solution structure of GIP was determined in 50% TFE. One- and two-dimensional NMR data collected using 800 and 900 MHz magnets showed well defined, high resolution, proton NMR spectra in aqueous TFE. Despite the low molecular mass of GIP of $5 kDa, a large number of negative NOE resonances have been recorded. Despite the absence of some resonances of individual amino acid spin systems in the TOCSY spectrum, complete connectivity patterns were found in the NOESY spectrum. The presence of short range aiH/Niþ1H and NiH/Niþ1H intraresidue connectivities supported the reliability of the assignments. The NH/aH region of the NOESY spectrum showed aiH/Niþ3H medium-range connectivities, revealing the occurrence of elements of helical secondary structure. The presence of strong aiH/biþ3H crosspeaks in the aH/bH region of the NOESY spectrum and small 3JHNHa coupling constants (<6 Hz) was a clear indication of the existence of an a-helical arrangement between Phe6 and Gln29. Weak aiH/Niþ3H and very weak aiH/biþ3H connectivities indicated a less well-defined helix in the region between Lys30 and Trp36. The remaining parts of the GIP sequence, particularly, the C-terminal region beyond Trp36, showed a series of strong aiH/Niþ1H, absence of aiH/Niþ3H, and aiH/biþ3H connectivities as well as medium 3JNHa coupling constants (7­9 Hz), typical of random coil conformations. The solution structures obtained by molecular modeling are consistent with the NMR data. Analysis of the calculated structures with PROCHECK-NMR40 revealed the presence of an a-helical backbone for residues between Phe6 and Gln29 in the 20 selected structures as well as a continued helix for residues Lys30-Trp36 in a number of structures. Therefore, four conformational regions of structure could be defined as an irregular N-terminal segment up to residue Thr5, a stable a-helical region between residues Phe6 and Gln29, a less well-defined helix between resiPROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

dues Lys30-Trp36 and a random coil region beyond residue Trp36. The C-terminal segment of the polypeptide (Lys37Gln42) is ill-defined (Figs. 3 and 4), hence it is thought to be in equilibrium among various conformational states. NMR and modeling data suggested that the N-terminal region of the polypeptide between residues 1­5 is less flexible than that of the C-terminal residues 37­42. The side chain groups of residues in the helical region also showed a compact conformation. The structure of GIP in aqueous TFE presented here is similar to that of the previously determined solution structure of GIP under physiological conditions in our laboratory, which was characterized by an a-helical arrangement between Ser11 and Gln29.35 The N termini remained unstructured in both cases, as did the C terminus in water, whereas the helix extended further towards the C terminus when TFE was present. Pairwise best-fit superposition of the helical segments (residues 11­28) of selected structures of GIP in aqueous TFE and water ° revealed surprisingly low RMSD values of 0.53 and 1.17 A for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively (Fig. 7). These results are also supported by preliminary studies of the peptide in phospholipidic media (unpublished data), which suggest that GIP adopts a helical structure. This leads us to conclude that the a-helical arrangement of GIP is its bioactive conformation. Furthermore, the fact that GIP adopts a helical conformation in 100% water allows us to conclude that, in this case, TFE stabilizes the helical segment, rather than merely inducing its formation. Our results are consistent with NMR and modeling studies of similar peptides of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)/secretin family.41 The other major incretin hormone, GLP-1,34 and the GLP-1 agonist exendin-442 have been shown to adopt similar a-helical conformations in aqueous TFE. The X-ray structure of glucagon also consists of a helix between residues 6 and 26.43 In fact, pairwise comparison of GIP with members of the glucagon family of peptides shows a high degree of sequence similarity and identity (Table II). This is to be expected since these peptides bind to GPCRs of the same class.41 Two regions are particularly well conserved, as can be seen in Figure 6: An area around residue 25 and the N terminus up to residue 6. The former corresponds to a hydrophobic region present in all compared peptides (Fig. 5). This observation and the fact that, in these peptides, the a-helix starts forming around this region34 leads us to the conclusion that this segment of the peptide is essential in receptor recognition and binding.

servation of this region in exendin-4, as well as the deviation of its hydrophilicity curve, is most probably because of its nonhuman origin44 when compared with the other peptides. It is thought that peptidic hormones that bind to seven transmembrane GPCRs, such as GIP, may do so in a twostage process: first, the peptide would bind to the cell membrane, and then to the receptor.45 Consequently, it is assumed that, as the peptide approaches the hydrophobic membrane, it adopts its biologically active conformation. A closer look at the arrangement of the side chains in GIP reveals two hydrophobic and two hydrophilic patches. The hydrophobic regions (Fig. 8, depicted in blue) are those formed by the side chains of Phe6, Ile7, Tyr10, Met14, and Ile17, and the side chains of Phe22, Val23, Trp25, Leu26, Leu27, and Ala28, respectively. Such distribution of residues would favor the occurrence of hydrophobic interactions between the helical segment of the peptide and the cellular membrane, further supporting the two-step binding theory.45 A similar arrangement has been observed in the helical region of VIP.46 The hydrophilic areas are defined by the side chains of residues Asp15, Lys16, His18, Gln19, Gln20, Asp21, and Asn24 (Fig. 8, depicted in red), and the C terminus of the peptide from residue 29 (Fig. 5), respectively. These hydrophilic segments may be important for activity, since the hydrophilic side chains will project outside the peptide, whereas the hydrophobic residues would tend to be buried within the helix. The fact that the C-terminal end of GIP is highly hydrophilic supports our previous study, in which we speculated that the C terminus gave the peptide the necessary stability for the formation of an a-helix in a purely aqueous solvent.35 Furthermore, our NMR results show that the a-helix tends to extend further towards this end. This extended, largely polar helical segment could account for the somatostatinotropic activity of GIP. The biological relevance of the N-terminal region of GIP has been extensively studied.11 However, to the best of our knowledge, the only study to report direct evidence of the structure of the N terminus of a similar peptide was that of receptor-bound PACAP21.45 PACAP21 binds to a GPCR of the same family as that of the GIP receptor and shows a sequence similarity with respect to GIP of 82% for residues 1­11. Similarly, this region is extremely well conserved in the aforementioned glucagonlike family of peptides. Therefore, it is very likely that these peptides have a similar three-dimensional structure, thus sharing a common interaction mechanism with their respective receptors. CONCLUSION In conclusion, results obtained from the aqueous TFE solution for native GIP show similarities with structures of other peptides of the same family. The set of structures calculated, consisting of a well-defined a-helix between residues 6 and 29 and an extended helical segment for residues 30­36, is compatible with all observed experimental data. These and previous results carried out in our laboratory35,47 together with studies of peptides of the same family under similar conditions48 and the
PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

fact that GIP in water also adopts a highly similar a-helical arrangement allow us to conclude that the a-helix is the bioactive conformation of GIP. Although TFE and organic solvents, in general, are widely being used in the study of the three-dimensional structure of polypeptides, some debate still remains regarding the physiological relevance of these studies.36,49 However, we have shown here that aqueous TFE is a valid and useful solvent to study the structural properties of polypeptides. We believe that the studies reported in this work go some way towards answering the questions related to the receptor-bound state of such peptides. Results presented in this article could be useful for designing receptor selective agonists or antagonists, which may lead to the development of drugs for type 2 diabetes therapy. NMR, modeling, and biological studies of GIP and its biologically active fragments under various conditions are currently being studied.
