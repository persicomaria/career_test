We have applied NMR and molecular dynamics computations including intensity based re®nement to de®ne the structure of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-GG-G-C) dodecanucleotide in 100 mM NaCl solution. The G-G-G-C sequence is of interest since it has been found as tandem repeats in the DNA sequence of human chromosome 19. The same G-G-G-C sequence is also seen as islands in adeno-associated virus, a human parvovirus, which is unique amongst eukaryotic DNA viruses in its ability to integrate site-speci®cally into a de®ned region of human chromosome 19. The d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) sequence forms a quadruplex in Na cation containing solution through head-to-tail dimerization of two symmetryrelated stem-hairpin loops with adjacent strands antiparallel to each other around the quadruplex. The connecting T4 loops are of the lateral type, resulting in a quadruplex structure containing two internal GÁ GÁG ÁG tetrads ¯anked by GÁC ÁGÁC tetrads. The G(anti)ÁG(syn)Á G(anti) ÁG(syn) tetrads are formed through dimerization associated hydrogen bonding alignments of a pair of Hoogsteen G(anti) ÁG(syn) mismatch pairs, while the G(anti)ÁC(anti)ÁG(anti)Á C(anti) tetrads are formed through dimerization associated bifurcated hydrogen bonding alignments involving the major groove edges of a pair of Watson-Crick GÁ C base-pairs. The quadruplex contains two distinct narrow and two symmetric wide grooves with extensive stacking between adjacent tetrad planes. The structure of the quadruplex contains internal cavities that can potentially accommodate Na cations positioned between adjacent tetrad planes. Three such Na cations have been modeled into the structure of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex. Finally, we speculate on the potential role of quadruplex formation involving GÁ GÁG ÁG and GÁ C ÁG ÁC tetrads during the integration of the adeno-associated parvovirus into its target on human chromosome 19, both of which involve stretches of G-G-G-C sequence elements.

DNA sequences can adopt higher-order architecture beyond duplex alignments, with previous research in this area focused on the three-dimensional structures and energetics of DNA triplexes (reviewed by Sun & Helene, 1993; Radhakrishnan & Patel, 1994; Plum et al., 1995), quadruplexes (reviewed by Rhodes & Giraldo, 1995; Pilch et al., 1995; Patel et al., 1999) and junctions (reviewed by

620 Lilley & Clegg, 1993; Altona et al., 1996). The range of strand directionalities and pairing alignments within these multi-stranded structures provide novel DNA architecture associated with molecular recognition and function. The structure of DNA quadruplexes formed by the pairing of Watson-Crick and mismatch-containing DNA duplexes is of great current interest since it impacts on processes ranging from the architecture of telomeric and centromeric sites to the potential pairing alignments during genetic recombination events. The initial efforts in this area have focused on monovalent cation coordinated Gquadruplexes formed by the stacking of planar G ÁG ÁGÁ G tetrads (Gellert et al., 1962; Henderson et al., 1987; Sen & Gilbert, 1988; Sundquist & Klug, 1989; Williamson et al., 1989; reviewed by Guschlbauer et al., 1990). These include G-quadruplexes formed by four separate strands (Wang & Patel, 1993a; Aboul-ela et al., 1994; Laughlan et al., 1994; Kettani et al., 1997; Phillips et al., 1997), by dimerization of hairpins (Kang et al., 1992; Smith & Feigon, 1992; Schultze et al., 1994b; Smith et al., 1994; Keniry et al, 1995; Kettani et al., 1995) and by the unimolecular folding of a single strand (Padmanabhan et al., 1993; Wang & Patel, 1993b, 1994, 1995; Schultze et al, 1994a; Wang et al., 1993; Smith et al., 1995; Catasti et al., 1996). The architecture of these quadruplexes is de®ned by the relative directionality of individual strands and the

distribution of syn and anti guanine residues within the quadruplex. More recently, it has been shown that Watson-Crick GÁC pairs can align through pairing along either their minor groove (Leonard et al., 1995; Salisbury et al., 1997) or major groove (Kettani et al., 1995) edges to form G ÁC Á GÁC tetrads, thus greatly expanding our current knowledge of potential tetrad alignments within quadruplexes (reviewed by Rhodes & Giraldo, 1995; Patel et al., 1999). Our efforts have focused on G ÁC ÁG ÁC tetrads formed through alignment of Watson-Crick pairs along their major groove edges as ®rst reported by us for d(G-C-G-G-T3-G-C-G-G) quadruplex in NaCl-containing the (C-G-G) fragile X triplet repeat disease sequence (Kettani et al., 1995). This quadruplex (shown schematically in Figure 1(a)) formed through head-to-tail dimerization of a pair of hairpins contains a pair of central G ÁC Á GÁC tetrads ¯anked by G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrads with adjacent strands running antiparallel to each other around the quadruplex. More recently we have attempted to generate a quadruplex (shown schematically in Figure 1(b)) containing central GÁG ÁGÁ G tetrads ¯anked by G ÁC Á GÁC tetrads with adjacent strands running antiparallel to each other. Our approach focused on the d(G-G-G-C-Tn-G-G-G-C) sequence, which has the potential to form such a quadruplex through head-to-tail dimerization of a pair of hair-

621 contains one predominant folded conformer under these conditions whose narrow NMR resonances are amenable to structural characterization. A second form can be detected in slow exchange with the folded form on diluting the sample of d(G1-G2-G3-C4-T4-G9-G10-G11-C12) in 100 mM NaCl solution. This new form does not contain narrow imino proton resonances between 11 and 14 ppm and has very narrow non-exchangeable proton resonances with chemical shifts characteristic of an unstructured single-stranded form. A systematic study of the concentration dependence of these two forms in equilibrium based on the relative intensity of the CH3 resonance of T8 yields the strand stoichiometry of the folded conformer to be 2.00 Æ 0.06 (Figure 3). Thus, the folded conformer is generated through dimerization of two strands of d(G1-G2-G3-C4-T4-G9-G10G11-C12) sequence in 100 mM NaCl solution. Exchangeable protons The imino and amino protons are well resolved in the exchangeable proton spectrum of the d(G-GG-C-T4-G-G-G-C) sequence in 100 mM NaCl containing H2O buffer (pH 6.6) at 10 C (Figure 2). We observe formation of a predominant conformer for which two guanine imino protons resonate between 13.0 and 13.4 ppm while four others resonate between 11.1 and 12.0 ppm (Figure 2). The former guanine imino protons resonate in a region characteristic of Watson-Crick base-pair formation while the latter guanine imino protons resonate in a region characteristic of G ÁG ÁGÁ G tetrad formation (Wang et al., 1991). We observe four cytosine amino protons between 8.8 and 9.2 ppm (Figure 2) originating in the two cytosine residues at positions C4 and C12 in the d(G1-G2-G3-C4-T4G9-G10-G11-C12) sequence. These down®eld cytosine amino proton shifts are characteristic of

pins. The G-G-G-C sequence is of biological interest since it has been found as tandem repeats in the DNA sequence of human chromosome 19. The G-G-G-C sequence is also observed as islands in adeno-associated virus, a human parvovirus, which is unique amongst eukaryotic DNA viruses in its ability to integrate site-speci®cally into a de®ned region of human chromosome 19 (Kotin et al., 1991, 1992; reviewed by Berns & Linden, 1995). Here we report on the high resolution solution structure of d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in NaCl solution while the companion paper (Bouaziz et al., 1998) reports on the corresponding high resolution solution structure of the d(G-G-GC-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in KCl solution. The combined contributions provide insights into the structural basis of a novel monovalent cationdependent conformational switch in the connecting loop and adjacent G ÁC Á GÁC tetrad in DNA quadruplexes formed through dimerization of stemhairpin loop domains. In addition, our experimental results combined with modeling of monovalent cation binding sites within d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-GC) quadruplex structures in NaCl and KCl solution potentially expand the knowledge base of known monovalent cation coordination sites on DNA and may be relevant to the design of nucleic acid inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase (Rando et al., 1995; Mazumder et al., 1996; Jing et al., 1997).

hydrogen bond formation and establish that both amino protons of each cytosine must be hydrogenbonded in the folded structure of this sequence in solution. The imino protons of the four thymine residues in the sequence form part of a broad envelope of resonances between 10.4 and 11.0 ppm. An independent assignment of guanine imino protons can be achieved by either chemical or isotope substitution of speci®c guanine residues in the sequence. An attempt to replace guanine G1 and G9 by inosine one at a time in the sequence was unsuccessful as monitored by the NMR spectral signatures that are characteristic of folded structure formation. This goal was achieved using the isotope substitution approach on a sample of the d(G1-G2-G3-C4-T4-G9-G10-G11-C12) 12-mer sequence containing 15N labels at the N1, N2 and N7 positions of guanine G1 and G10. We have recorded the proton difference spectrum of 15N decoupled/15N coupled spectra of this site-speci®cally labeled 12-mer in 100 mM NaCl containing H2O buffer (pH 6.6) at 20 C. We observe a difference pattern at 13.06 ppm (assigned to the imino proton of G1) in the spectral region characteristic of Watson-Crick pair formation and another difference pattern at 11.12 ppm (assigned to the imino proton of G10) in the spectral region characteristic

of GÁG ÁG ÁG tetrad formation. The replacement of T5 by dU5 was helpful in differentiating between the overlapped H-6 protons of T5 and T6 within the T4-T5-T6-T7 segment of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-GG-G-C) 12-mer sequence. The availability of the imino proton assignments of G1 and G10 then permitted the assignment of the expanded NOESY (250 ms mixing time) contour plot (Figure 4(a)) correlating NOEs between imino protons and imino, amino and base protons in the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) sequence in 100 mM NaCl containing H2O buffer (pH 6.6) at 10 C. The observed NOE cross-peak assignments are listed in the legend to Figure 4(a). The imino protons of guanine residues G1 and G9 are involved in Watson-Crick GÁC pair formation, since they exhibit NOEs to cytosine amino and H5 protons across the pair (labeled cross-peaks a, b, c, d, q and r in Figure 4(a)). The cytosine H-5 protons can be unambiguously assigned from an analysis of the non-exchangeable proton spectra permitting de®nitive identi®cation of the exchangeable imino and amino protons associated with the G1 ÁC12 and G9 ÁC4 Watson-Crick base-pairs. Since, both cytosine amino protons of C4 (8.88 and 9.18 ppm) and C12 (8.82 and 9.15 ppm) resonate at low ®eld and are hence hydrogen-bonded, the experimental data are suggestive of Watson-Crick GÁ C basepairs potentially dimerizing through their major groove edges to form a G ÁC Á GÁC tetrad alignment. The G2, G3, G10 and G11 guanine imino protons are involved in G-tetrad formation, since each guanine imino proton exhibits an NOE to its Hoogsteen aligned adjacent guanine H-8 proton (independently assigned from an analysis of nonexchangeable proton spectra) around the G-tetrad (cross-peaks k, l, i and j, Figure 4(a)). The directionality of hydrogen bond donor to acceptor alignments of the G2 ÁG3 ÁG10 ÁG11 G-tetrad was established by the observation of an NOE between the imino proton of G10 (identi®ed de®nitively from the selective 15N-labeling experiment) and the H-8 proton of G11 (peak i, Figure 4(a)). The formation of a G-tetrad by the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-GC) sequence in 100 mM NaCl solution can only occur if the 12-mer folds into a hairpin, which in turn dimerizes into a quadruplex. Such a head-totail quadruplex alignment exhibits strand symmetry as required by the NMR spectral data, which exhibits a single set of resonances for the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) sequence. The imino and amino proton chemical shifts in the d(G-G-G-C-T4G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl at 10 C are given in Table 1. A schematic of the folding topology of the d(G1G2-G3-C4-T4-G9-G10-G11-C12) quadruplex formed in 100 mM NaCl solution is outlined in Figure 1(b) together with the hydrogen bond donor to acceptor directionalities around the G1 ÁC12 ÁG9 ÁC4 and G2 ÁG3 ÁG10 Á G11 tetrads.

The cross-peaks a to x are assigned as follows: a, G9(NH-1)-C4(NH2-4 tetrad); b, G9(NH-1)-C4(NH2-4 WC); c, G1(NH-1)-C12(NH2-4 WC); d, G1(NH-1)-C12(NH2-4 tetrad); e, G11(NH-1)-C12(NH2-4 WC); f, G3(NH-1)-C4(NH2-4 WC); g, G9(NH-1)-G10(H-8); h, G9(NH-1)-T7(H-6); i, G10(NH-1)-G11(H-8); j, G2(NH-1)-G3(H-8); k, G11(NH-1)-G2(H-8); l, G3(NH-1)-G10(H-8); m, C12(NH2-4)-G9(H-8); n, C4(NH2-4)-G1(H-8); o, G9(NH-1)-T5(H-1H ); p, G1(NH-1)-C12(H-1H ); q, G9(NH-1)-C4(H-5); r, G1(NH-1)-C12(H-5); s and v, C12(NH2-4)-C12(H-5); t and u, C4(NH2-4)-C4(H-5); w, G1(NH-1)-T8(CH3-5); x, C12(NH2-4)-T8(CH3-5).

The lines trace the NOE connectivities between the base protons and their own and 5H -¯anking sugar H-1H protons from G1 to C12. The cytidine H-6 ± H-5 NOEs are designated by asterisks. The NOE cross-peaks a to f are assigned as follows: a, G11(H-8)-C12(H-5); b, G9(H-8)-C12(H-5); c, G3(H-8)-C4(H-5); d, G1(H-8)-C4(H-5); e, T8(H-6)-C12(H-5); f, G2(H-8)-G3(H-1H ). (It should be noted that we also observe additional broader cross-peaks in this expanded NOESY contour plot which are unassigned at this time. They are likely to originate in minor conformer(s) of the quadruplex and/or the single-stranded form of the d(G-GG-C-T4-G-G-G-C) sequence in NaCl containing solution. The strongest of these additional cross-peaks are likely to correspond to the strong NOE between H-5 and H-6 protons of cytosine residues in these minor conformers).

Non-exchangeable protons The non-exchangeable protons in the d(G-G-GC-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex formed in 100 mM NaCl solution have been assigned following analysis of the NOESY, COSY and TOCSY NMR spectra of the complex in 2H2O buffer at pH 6.6 and 20 C. An expanded NOESY (300 ms mixing time) contour plot correlating the base (7.0 to 8.2 ppm) and sugar H-1H (5.1 to 6.6 ppm) protons is plotted in Figure 4(b). We have traced the NOEs between the base protons and their own and 5H -¯anking sugar H-1H protons from G1 to C12 in the d(G1-G2G3-C4-T4-G9-G10-G11-C12) sequence as shown in Figure 4(b). The strong NOEs observed between the H-8 and their own H-1H protons for G2 and

G10 in a 50 ms short mixing time NOESY spectrum with intensities comparable to the NOEs between cytosine H-6 and H-5 protons (®xed Ê 2.46 A separation) of C4 and C12 establish formation of syn glycosidic torsion angles (Patel et al., 1982) at the G2 and G10 residues in the d(G-G-GC-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex. An independent assignment of the H-8 protons of G1 and G10 emerges from the difference spectra of the d(G1-G2-G3-C4-T4-G9-G10-G11-C12) 12-mer sequence containing 15N labels at the N1, N2 and N7 positions of guanine G1 and G10. The measurable two-bond coupling between the N7 nitrogen and H-8 proton results in difference patterns at the H-8 proton chemical shifts of G1 (7.95 ppm) and G10 (7.51 ppm) in the difference spectrum of the

quadruplex. The non-exchangeable base and sugar proton assignments have been identi®ed by analysis of the entire NOESY and TOCSY data sets of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex and the chemical shifts in 100 mM NaCl at 20 C are summarized in Table 1. There are several cross-peaks in the expanded NOESY spectrum in Figure 4(b) that are unassigned at this time and must originate from minor conformer(s) of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) sequence in NaCl containing solution.

NOEs between G ÁC ÁG Á C tetrad and T-T-T-T loop segment The alignment of the T5-T6-T7-T8 loop segment relative to the G1 ÁC12 ÁG9 ÁC4 tetrad is de®ned by a set of NOEs involving both exchangeable and non-exchangeable protons in the d(G1-G2-G3-C4T5-T6-T7-T8-G9-G10-G11-C12) quadruplex in NaCl solution. Several examples of such restraints involving exchangeable protons between non-adjacent residues include NOEs between the imino proton of G9 and the H-6 proton of T7 (peak h, Figure 4a) and the H-1H proton of T5 (peak o, Figure 4(a)), between the imino proton of G1 and the CH3-5 protons of T8 (peak w, Figure 4(a)), and between the amino protons of C12 and the CH3-5 protons of T8 (peak x, Figure 4(a)). Additional examples of such restraints that involve non-exchangeable protons between non-adjacent residues include NOEs between the T8(H-6) and C12(H-5) protons and between the G1(H-8) and T7(H-6) protons in the quadruplex. These NOEs should help to de®ne the potential stacking of individual thymine bases over the G ÁC Á GÁC tetrad in the quadruplex. Head-to-tail dimerization involving lateral hairpin loops The NMR data permit us to distinguish between head-to-tail dimerization of hairpins (T4 loops positioned at opposite ends of the quadruplex) versus one generated through head-to-head dimerization (T4 loops positioned on the same side of the quadruplex) of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in NaCl solution. The observation of NOEs between the G1(NH-1) and T8(CH3-5) protons (peak w, Figure 4(a)), between the C12(NH2-4) and T8(CH3-5) protons (peak x, Figure 4(a)) and between the T8(H-6) and C12(H-5) protons (peak e, Figure 4(b)) de®nitively establish a head-to-tail alignment of the hairpin dimers that form the quadruplex. The T4 loops in the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in NaCl solution can be of either the lateral or diagonal kind. Both types have been observed in DNA quadruplexes with the lateral

NOE patterns within and between G ÁC ÁG Á C and G ÁG ÁG Á G tetrads We detect NOEs between the G9(H-8) and both C12(H-5) (peak b, Figure 4(b)) and C12(NH2-4) (peak m, Figure 4(a)) protons and between the G1(H-8) and both C4(H-5) (peak d, Figure 4(b)) and C4(NH2-4) (peak n, Figure 4(a)) protons that de®ne the G1 Á C12 ÁG9 ÁC4 tetrad alignment. These are critical NOEs, since they are between the G1 ÁC12 and G9 ÁC4 Watson-Crick base-pairs and, in addition, across the stem-hairpin loop dimers that form the quadruplex. A set of cross-strand NOEs de®nes the relative donor-to-acceptor hydrogen bond directionalities between the adjacent G1 Á C12 ÁG9 ÁC4 and G2 ÁG3 ÁG10 Á G11 tetrads in the quadruplex. These include NOEs between the imino protons of G1 and G11 and between the imino protons of G3 and G9 across these adjacent tetrads in the quadruplex. We also detect NOEs that involve exchangeable and non-exchangeable protons that could potentially originate between protons within a given G2 ÁG3 ÁG10 Á G11 tetrad or between adjacent G2 ÁG3 ÁG10 Á G11 tetrads in the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-GG-C) quadruplex in NaCl solution. This ambiguity is associated with strand symmetry that relates the two adjacent GÁ GÁG ÁG tetrads in the interior of the G-quadruplex (Figure 1(b)). Some examples of such ambiguous NOEs include those between the G10(H-8) and G11(H-8) protons and between the G2(H-8) and G3(H-8) protons in the quadruplex.

The input restraints statistics for the structure calculations of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-GC) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution are listed in Table 2. The distribution of distance restraints at each residue in the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in NaCl solution are plotted in Figure 5(a) and (b). The structure calculations on the d(G-G-G-C-T4G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution were undertaken in three stages. Following metric matrix distance geometry and simulated annealing regularization, eight structures were selected out of 100 based on their low covalent energies and relatively few input-restraint violations. These structures were re®ned in the second stage against distance restraints using molecular dynamics calculations and these distance-re®ned structures were subsequently re®ned further in the third stage against NOE intensity restraints from NOESY data sets at ®ve mixing times. (The protocols for the re®nement computations are outlined in Materials and Methods.) The quality of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-GG-G-C) quadruplex structures after each stage of the computations is summarized in Table 3. The ®nal intensity re®ned structures of the d(G-G-G-CT4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution exhibit very good R-factors and convergence statistics.

The NMR data de®ning strand alignment and syn/anti distribution around the G-tetrad are only consistent with lateral loop formation in the d(G-G-G-CT4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex. In addition, demonstration of Watson-Crick G1 Á C12 base-pair formation is only consistent with lateral loop alignment. Input restraints and structure calculations Distance restraints for the exchangeable protons were qualitatively deduced from NOESY data sets (two mixing times) on the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl containing H2O solution.

quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution as labeled in Figure 7(c) and (d). Models of the quadruplex that include bound Na cations Previously reported X-ray analysis of G-quadruplexes have identi®ed the role of monovalent cations in stabilizing the structures of quadruplexes containing either all parallel strands determined to high resolution (Laughlan et al., 1994; Phillips et al., 1997) or adjacent strands that are antiparallel to each other determined to moderate resolution (Kang et al., 1992). The monovalent cations are sandwiched between G-tetrad planes and coordinated to the inwardly pointing guanine O6 oxygen atoms of individual G-tetrads. We have used the GRASP program (Nicholls et al., 1991) to identify potential cavities that could accommodate Na cations either between tetrad planes and/or within the T4 hairpin loop of the intensity re®ned structures of d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in NaCl containing solution. Three cavities were identi®ed and they were all located between tetrad planes of this quadruplex. One of these potential Na binding cavities was located between adjacent G2 ÁG3 ÁG10 Á G11 tetrads and the other two between symmetry-related adjacent G1 Á C12 ÁG9 Á C4 and G2Á G3 ÁG10 ÁG11 tetrads in the quadruplex. An averaged structure was computed from the eight distance-re®ned structures of the d(G-G-G-CT4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl without incorporation of ions, and this averaged structure subjected to minimization and dynamics protocols with all constraints. Two views (similar in orientation to those in Figure 6) of this averaged minimized structure are shown in Figure 8(a). A nonhydrated Na cation was next inserted into each of these cavities in the averaged structure and molecular dynamics re®nements undertaken with the full set of distance restraints together with additional restraints de®ning Na to coordinating oxygen and Na to Na distances (with bounds Ê of Æ 20%) obtained from the 1.2 A crystal structure of a G-quadruplex (Laughlan et al. (1994); this Ê structure has been re®ned to 0.95 A by Phillips et al. (1997). (The protocols for the re®nement computations are outlined in Materials and Methods.) Two views of the averaged minimized model of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex with three bound Na cations are shown in Figure 8(b). The coordinating oxygen atoms are shown as red balls in Figure 8(a) and (b) while the bound Na cations are shown as orange balls in Figure 8(b). The NMR restraint statistics and the quality of the averaged re®ned structures (without Na cations) and averaged re®ned models (with Na cations) of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex are listed in Table 4. The same results emerge for computations where the monovalent cations are placed in the center of mass of the oxygen atoms forming the cavity, without the incorporation of cation-oxygen and cation-cation restraints.

Discussion
Folding topology The d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution is formed through the head-to-tail dimerization of a pair of hairpins such that adjacent strands are antiparallel to each other around the quadruplex (Figure 1(b)). The dimerization of the hairpins involves the mutual alignments of the major groove edges of the Watson-Crick G1 ÁC12 and G9Á C4 base-pairs to form the terminal G1 ÁC12 Á G9ÁC4 tetrads (Figure 7(a)) and the major groove edges of the Hoogsteen G2 ÁG11 and G10 ÁG3 mismatch pairs to form the internal G2 ÁG3 ÁG10 Á G11 tetrads (Figure 7(b)). Such a structure exhibits strand symmetry and contains two unique narrow and two equivalent wide grooves. We have identi®ed syn guanine residues at positions G2 and G10 corresponding to G1/ G9(anti)-G2/G10(syn)-G3/G11(anti)-C4/C12(anti) alignments along individual strands and G2(syn) Á G3(anti)Á G10(syn)ÁG11(anti) alignments around individual G-tetrads in the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-GC) quadruplex. The T4 loops in the d(G-G-G-C-T4G-G-G-C) quadruplex are of the lateral (Figure 1(b)) rather than the diagonal type. Such a folding topology involving adjacent anti-parallel strands and lateral loops directed towards opposite ends of the quadruplex has been observed in the X-ray structure of the K cation stabilized Oxytricha d(G4T4G4) sequence, which involves head-to-tail dimerization to form a G-quadruplex (Kang et al., 1992), and the NMR solution, structure of the fragile X syndrome triplet repeat d(G-C-G-G-T3-GC-G-G) sequence in NaCl solution, which also

involves head-to-tail dimerization to form a Gquadruplex (Kettani et al., 1995). Helical parameters We used planarity restraints for bases within individual tetrads during the early phases of the computations but these were lifted during the last 10 ps of distance-restrained dynamics and were not incorporated during the intensity-restrained dynamics. Nevertheless, the bases are suf®ciently coplanar within individual G ÁC Á GÁC and G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrads in the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution (Figure 6(a)). The helical parameters have been estimated using the CURVES 5.2 program (Lavery & Sklenar, 1989). The adjacent G2 ÁG3 ÁG10 Á G11 tetrads stack primarily through overlap of their purine ®vemembered rings (Figure 7c) with the tetrad planes related by a right-handed twist of 19.7 . The G2 ÁG3 ÁG10 Á G11 and G1 ÁC12 Á G9 ÁC4 tetrads stack primarily through overlap of the six-membered rings of the guanine residues of the G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrad and the six-membered rings of the guanine and cytosine residues of the GÁC ÁGÁ C tetrad (Figure 7(d)) with the tetrad planes related by a right-handed twist of 33.7 . The alternating strand directionalities and distinct sequence composition of the 2-fold symmetric d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution results in three distinct grooves with unique dimensions (Figure 7(c) and (d)). Symmetrical wide grooves are formed by the antiparallel alignment of adjacent G1-G2-G3-C4 and G9-G10G11-C12 strands of each hairpin with a groove

Narrow grooves of somewhat different dimensions are formed by the antiparallel alignment of adjacent G1-G2-G3-C4 strands (designated N1) with a Ê groove width of 10.1 A and adjacent G9-G10-G11C12 strands (designated N2) with a groove width Ê of 9.0 A. This alternation of narrow and wide grooves reported for the solution structure of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex has been observed in other G-quadruplex structures where adjacent strands have been aligned antiparallel to

each other (Kang et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1993; Schultze et al., 1994a; Kettani et al., 1995).

The loop T5 base stacks partially with the C4 base of the GÁ C ÁG ÁC tetrad while the loop T8 base stacks well with the C12 base of the G ÁC Á GÁC tetrad in the solution structure of the quadruplex.

towards the exterior while the T7 base is directed towards the interior of the loop amongst the re®ned structures of the quadruplex. The stacked T5 and T8 loop bases are better de®ned than the T6 and T7 loop bases within the T5-T6-T7-T8 segment of the quadruplex (Figure 5(c)). There is no internal cavity within the T5-T6-T7-T8 loop fold and this precludes the potential accommodation of a monovalent Na cation within this loop fold. This observation is consistent with the smaller T3 loop being able to replace a T4 loop while retaining the predominant conformer of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-GG-C) quadruplex. G ÁC ÁG Á C tetrads The solution structure of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-GG-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution (shown schematically in Figure 1(b)) contains internal G ÁG ÁGÁ G tetrads (Figure 7(b)) ¯anked by G ÁC Á GÁC tetrads (Figure 7(a)). The G ÁC Á GÁC tetrad formation involves hydrogen bonding align-

ment of two Watson-Crick GÁC base-pairs through their major groove edges using bifurcated hydrogen bonds (Figure 7(a)). Both amino protons of the cytidine residues are hydrogen-bonded within the G ÁC Á GÁC tetrad (Figure 7a) accounting for the observed down®eld chemical shifts (8.8 to 9.2 ppm) of both cytidine amino protons in the spectrum of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution. There have been con¯icting positions in the scienti®c literature as to the exact alignment of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in models associated with the potential pairing of the major groove edges of Watson-Crick G ÁC base-pairs to form a GÁ C ÁG ÁC tetrad (Lowdin, 1969; Kubitschek & Henderson, 1966; O'Brien, 1967; McGavin, 1971; Mitas et al., 1995). We avoided any bias in our computations by generating starting structures where hydrogen bonding restraints aligned the cytidine amino protons either with the guanine O6 oxygen atoms or with the guanine N7 nitrogen atoms across Watson-Crick G ÁC pairs involved in

G ÁC Á GÁC tetrad formation. The structure re®nements yielded GÁC ÁGÁ C tetrads involving bifurcated hydrogen bonds from the cytidine amino protons to the guanine O6 oxygen atoms and N7 nitrogen atoms across Watson-Crick G ÁC pairs (Figure 7(a)) independent of the starting alignment. These results establish that the pairing alignments around the GÁ C ÁG ÁC tetrad (Figure 7(a)) are driven by distance restraints associated with NOEs between the G1(H-8) and C4(H-5) protons (peak d, Figure 4(b)) and between the G9(H-8) and C12(H5) protons (peak b, Figure 4(b)). Such a G ÁC ÁG ÁC tetrad which involves alignment of a pair of Watson-Crick GÁ C base-pairs through their major groove edges (O'Brian, 1967; Kettani et al., 1995; this study) is distinct from a related G ÁC ÁG ÁC tetrad which involves alignment of a pair of Watson-Crick G ÁC base-pairs through their minor groove edges (Leonard et al., 1995; Salisbury et al., 1997). Modeling of potential Na cation coordination between tetrads There are two distinct types of potential Na cation binding sites in the model of the Na cation coordinated d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex (Figure 8(b)). One of these types has been reported for certain monovalent cation binding sites in the crystal structure of Na cation coordinated parallel-stranded d(T-G-G-G-G-T) quadruplex (Laughlan et al., 1994; Phillips et al., 1997) and involves sandwiching of the Na cation between G ÁG ÁGÁ G tetrads in the center of the d(G-G-G-CT4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex. The Na cation in this case is coordinated by a total of eight oxygen atoms involving four guanine O6 oxygen atoms from each GÁ GÁG ÁG tetrad plane. The second type involves sandwiching of the Na cation between G ÁG ÁGÁ G and G ÁC Á GÁC tetrads in which case the Na cation is coordinated by a total of seven oxygen

atoms from the DNA. Four of these coordinating oxygen atoms involve the guanine O6 oxygen atoms from the G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrad plane, two involve guanine O6 oxygen atoms from the G ÁC Á GÁC tetrad plane and the remaining oxygen is associated with the O2 oxygen of inwardly pointing of T7 in the hairpin loop. Comparison between G-C-G-G and G-G-G-C containing quadruplexes Our laboratory has now solved the solution structures of the d(G-C-G-G-T3-G-C-G-G) quadruplex containing the C-G-G fragile X syndrome triplet repeat sequence in NaCl solution (Kettani et al., 1995) and the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex containing G-G-G-C repeats in NaCl solution seen in the adeno-associated virus DNA sequence and human chromosome 19 (this study). Each quadruplex contains two GÁ GÁG ÁG and GÁ C ÁG ÁC tetrads with the GÁ C ÁG ÁC tetrads forming the central core of the d(G-C-G-G-T3-G-C-G-G) quadruplex in NaCl solution (Kettani et al., 1995; Figure 1(a)) and the G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrads forming the central core of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in NaCl solution (this study; Figure 1(b)). Thus, quadruplexes involving antiparallel alignment of adjacent strands in NaCl solution can form involving different arrangements of stacked GÁ GÁG ÁG and G ÁC Á GÁC tetrads. Biological significance Our demonstration of formation of G ÁC Á GÁC tetrads in quadruplexes formed by the dimerization of the d(G-C-G-G-T3-G-C-G-G) stem-hairpin loops in NaCl solution (Kettani et al., 1995; Figure 1(a)) and the dimerization of the d(G-G-GC-T4-G-G-G-C) stem-hairpin loops in NaCl solution (this study; Figure 1(b)) has potentially important

632 implications for the alignment of duplex segments involved in genetic recombination. A case in point involves the human parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV), which integrates, site speci®cally, into human chromosome 19 q13.4-ter (Kotin et al., 1990, 1991; Samulski et al., 1991). AAV is non-pathogenic for man (Blacklow et al., 1968) and an understanding of its integration is important for the use of the virus as a vector for gene therapy. The human target sequence of AAV within chromosome 19, designated AAVS1, has been identi®ed and sequenced (Kotin et al., 1992). The sequence of AAVS1 shows no apparent homology with the sequence of AAV and an analysis of the proviral junction of AAV suggests that integration occurs by non-homologous recombination (Kotin et al. 1992). The recombination event between the AAV terminal repeat sequence and its AAVS1 target on chromosome 19 is mediated by AAV rep gene products which control viral propagation. One of these proteins, Rep68, has both helicase and sequence-speci®c endonuclease activities and is essential for viral DNA replication and excision (Im & Muzyczka, 1990). It has been shown that the AAVS1 sequence, the AAV terminal repeat sequences and the Rep protein are all involved in non-homologous recombination. Kotin and coworkers have established that viral integration requires a rearrangement of the AAV viral sequences by inversions and translocations (Kotin & Berns, 1989), as well as of AAVS1 cellular sequences (Kotin et al., 1992). These rearrangements occur coordinately and can result in formation of stem-hairpin loop structures for both AAV viral terminal repeat and AAVS1 chromosomal sequences. It is likely that the Rep proteins recognize these stem-hairpin loop secondary structures and mediate the recombination between AAV viral terminal repeat sequences, and cellular AAVS1 sequences. The G  C content is extremely high for both AAV and AAVS1 sequences, making these G-rich segments potential candidates for Gquadruplex formation on the pathway to integration. In addition, it is noteworthy that each of the two AAV terminal repeat sequences contains three sets of G-G-G-C segments in close proximity and the AAVS1 sequence of human chromosome 19 contains direct repeats of the G-G-G-C segment. One can therefore speculate that the potential participation of quadruplex structures on the pathway to integration of the viral AAV sequence into the chromosomal AAVS1 site could involve, in part, stacked GÁC ÁGÁ C and G ÁGÁ GÁG tetrads along the lines reported here for the quadruplex formed by the dimerization of d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) stemhairpin loop structures.

The crude 5b-dimethoxytrityl protected products were puri®ed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C4 column (Rainin Instrument Co.) with a linear gradient of 1%/min of acetonitrile in 10 mM triethylammonium acetate (pH 6.8), detritylated upon treatment with 80% (v/v) acetic acid for 30 minutes and chromatographed a second time with a linear gradient of 0.5%/min in the same buffer as the ®rst chromatography. The volume of the collected eluent containing the pure oligodeoxyribonucleotide was next reduced to 10 ml. The product was dialyzed against water several times and against 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 6.5) for four hours and ®nally against 5 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 6.5) and lyophilized. The details of the synthesis and puri®cation of the d(G1-G2-G3-C4-T4-G9-G10-G11-C12) sequence labeled with 15N at the N1, N2 and N7 positions of G1 and G10 will be reported elsewhere.

NMR sample preparation and experiments Approximately 300 A260 units of d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-GG-C) were dissolved in 0.6 ml 2H2O (%5 mM in single strands) for non-exchangeable proton NMR experiments or in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O for exchangeable proton NMR experiments. The ®nal NaCl concentration was 100 mM in the buffer. All NMR experiments (NOESY, COSY-45, COSY-90 and TOCSY) in 2H2O were conducted at 20 C and NOESY experiments in H2O were conducted at 10 C. The proton NOESY experiments (mixing time 80 and 250 ms) in H2O were recorded with the H2O signal suppressed by a jump-and-return pulse sequence as the reading pulse (Plateau & Gueron, 1982). The carrier frequency was placed on the H2O resonance with the maximum excitation centered at 12.0 ppm. The proton NOESY experiments in 2H2O were recorded at mixing times of 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 ms in the hypercomplex mode. The spectra were collected with 2048 complex points in the t2 dimension and 300 real free induction decays in the t1 dimension with a spectral width of 4.8 kHz. A repetition delay of 3.2 seconds was used and the residual HDO signal was suppressed by low-power continuous wave irradiation during this delay. Homonuclear proton total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments were acquired with 2048 t2 complex points and 300 t1 increments in the hypercomplex mode with spin-lock times of 40 and 80 ms. The phasesensitive correlation spectroscopy (COSY-45 and COSY90) experiments were acquired with 2048 t2 complex points and 512 t1 increments. All experiments were performed on Varian Unity Inova 600 MHz spectrometers. The data sets were processed by Varian software and the real matrixes were transformed to the FELIX format. All NOESY and TOCSY data sets were apodized by a 90 -shifted sinebell squared function. The ®nal matrix contained 2048 Â 2048 real points. All proton chemical shifts were referenced relative to internal sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5sulfonate (DSS, for 1H). The cross-peaks were picked

È with the ``SUM'' averaging option in X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992; Nilges, 1995), which allows for ambiguity in the atom speci®cation in input distance restraints. This feature is particularly useful, since about 50% of the NOE cross-peaks arise from a combination of intra-strand and inter-strand proton pairs, and the inherent symmetry in the system prevents strand speci®c assignments of the cross-peaks. Out of 100 attempts at embedding and optimization, eight best structures were selected based on the criterion of acceptable covalent geometry, low distance restraint violations, and favorable non-bonded energy. These eight structures were further optimized with restrained molecular dynamics simulations. Distance restrained molecular dynamics Restrained molecular dynamics was carried out in vacuum with a distance-dependent dielectric constant. The dynamics was initiated at 5 K and the temperature was gradually increased to 1000 K in 5.0 ps and then equilibrated for 1.0 ps. The force constants for the disÊ tance restraints were kept at 2.0 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 during these stages. Subsequently, the force constants for the distance restraints were scaled up to a ®nal value of Ê 50 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 over 6.0 ps. The system was then allowed to evolve for 20.0 ps at 1000 K and then slow cooled to 300 K in 14.0 ps and equilibrated for 10.0 ps. The coordinates saved every 0.5 ps in the last 4.0 ps were averaged. The resulting structure was subject to conjugate gradient minimization till a ®nal gradient of Ê 0.1 kcal molÀ1 AÀ1 was reached. All dynamics were carried out with a time step of 1.0 fs, and the force constant on the hydrogen bond related distance restraints was Ê maintained at 100.0 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 throughout. All experimentally observed distance restraints were speci®ed ambiguously with ``SUM'' averaging. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained throughout. Relaxation matrix intensity refinement All eight distance re®ned structures were next subjected to relaxation matrix based direct NOE intensity re®nement in vacuum, using X-PLOR. NOE volumes from 240 cross-peaks for each of ®ve mixing times were used as restraints, with uniform upper and lower bounds of Æ20%. The volume restraints were speci®ed ambiguously with multiple atom selection. During re®nement, X-PLOR restrains the sum of the corresponding calculated intensities to the observed ones. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained throughout. The R1/6 term (Nilges et al., 1991) was minimized during the re®nement. The R1/6 factor is de®ned by: R1a6  ÆjIys 1a6 À KIgl 1a6 j ÆIys 1a6

Stoichiometry of multimeric form Six samples containing decreasing known concentrations of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) sequence were prepared in 2H2O solution containing 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM phosphate (pH 6.6). The samples were incubated for three weeks at room temperature to ensure equilibration between single-stranded and multimeric states. The intensities of the resolved CH3 resonance of T8 were monitored at each concentration for both the multimeric and single-stranded states at equilibrium in slow exchange. The concentration of the multimeric state and the single-stranded state are plotted in Figure 3 with the experimental data ®t to the equation [M]  [SS]n/Kd, where [M] and [SS] are the concentration of the multimer and the single strand, respectively and n is the number of strands in the multimeric state.

Distance restraints The distances between non-exchangeable protons were estimated from the buildup of NOE intensities as a function of mixing time (50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 ms) in 2 H2O. A quadratic polynomial was ®tted to the data points and the initial slope was calculated from the linear ®t of the quadratic curves to the ®rst non-zero mixing Ê time. The cytosine H-5 to H-6 distance of 2.46 A was used as the standard for calibrating initial slopes to inter-proton distances. The upper and lower bounds were uniformly assigned to Æ20% of the estimated distance. Cross-peaks involving exchangeable protons in the NOESY spectra (80 and 250 ms mixing times) in H2O were classi®ed as strong (strong intensity at 80 ms), medium (weak intensity at 80 ms), and weak (peak observed only at 250 ms), and the corresponding proton Ê pairs were restrained to distances of 3.0(Æ0.6) A, Ê Ê 4.0(Æ0.8) A and 5.0(Æ1.0) A, respectively. The hydrogen bonds de®ned by the experimental restraints were constrained to distances corresponding to ideal hydrogen bond geometry during the computations (Saenger, 1984). Planarity restraints were not used during the later stages of the computations and were not incorporated during the intensity-restrained dynamics. The two strands of DNA are identical in solution, as evidenced by a single set of resonances in the NMR spectra of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex in 100 mM NaCl solution. Hence, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed on all non-hydrogen Ê atoms, with a force constant of 300 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2, to maintain the two strands superimposable.

Distance geometry and simulated annealing regularization Metric matrix distance geometry calculations were È performed, with the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) to embed and optimize initial structures. The experimentally obtained distance restraints were duplicated for the two strands of DNA, during the embedding stage of the protocol. For optimization with simulated annealing (DGSA protocol) all distance restraints were speci®ed

where K is the calibration factor, IObs is the observed intensity, ICalc is the calculated intensity and the summations run through all observed, quanti®able NOE cross-peaks in NOESY spectra recorded in 2H2O solution at ®ve different mixing times (50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 ms). Dynamics was initiated at 5 K with distance restraints as at the end of the distance restrained molecular dynamics simulation. After heating the system to 300 K in 0.6 ps, the NOE intensity restraints were

634
introduced by gradually scaling the force constant over 1.0 ps to a ®nal value of 300. Simultaneously, the force constant on the NOE derived distance restraints on the non-exchangeable protons were scaled down to zero. The system was equilibrated at 300 K for 3.0 ps and the resulting structure was subject to conjugate gradient minimization till a ®nal gradient of 0.1 kcal molÀ1 Ê AÀ1 was reached. The distance restraints on the exchangeable protons, and on the atoms involved in hydrogen bonding in the tetrad planes were maintained throughout. Ê During dynamics, a cutoff of 4.5 A was employed for computing relaxation pathways, and an isotropic correlation time of 3.75 ns was used based on a grid search. Distance restrained molecular dynamics with Na cations The GRASP program (Nicholls et al., 1991) was used to identify potential cavities capable of accommodating Ê Na cations (van der Waals radius 3.0 A) within the fold of the structure of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-G-G-G-C) quadruplex re®ned in the absence of Na cations. Three such cavities lined by oxygen atoms were identi®ed within the structure of the quadruplex and were all located between tetrad planes. The central cavity was positioned between G2Á G3ÁG10 ÁG11 tetrad planes while the ¯anking cavities were positioned between G1ÁC4 Á G9Á C12 and G2Á G3Á G10Á G11 tetrad planes. The distance between the Na cation and the coordinated guanine O6 oxygen atoms and between adjacent bound Na cations were estimated from the coordinates of the high resolÊ ution 1.2 A X-ray structure of the parallel-stranded d(TG-G-G-G-T) quadruplex (Laughlan et al., 1994). These distances with bounds of Æ 20% were used to position the Na cations within the cavities during the computations. Initially, an average structure was generated from the eight distance re®ned structures of the d(G-G-G-C-T4-GG-G-C) quadruplex. Three Na cations were next positioned within the cavities and the system subjected to a conjugate gradient minimization until the gradient Ê reached a value smaller than 0.1 kcal molÀ1 AÀ1. The system was next subjected to 10 ps of restrained molecular dynamics at 300 K followed by another round of conjugate gradient minimization until a value of 0.1 kcal Ê molÀ1 AÀ1 was reached for the ®nal gradient. The exchangeable and non-exchangeable proton restraints were used for all steps and speci®ed ambiguously using the ``SUM'' average option. The hydrogen bonds were restrained and non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were maintained throughout the computations. Planarity restraints were not used during the computations. Graphics programs INSIGHT II (Molecular Simulations, Inc) and GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991) programs were used to display structures. Helical torsion angles were measured using the program CURVES 5.2 (Lavery & Sklenar, 1989).
