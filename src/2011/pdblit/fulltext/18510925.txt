The XPD protein is central to our understanding of the relationship between NER deficiencies and human disorders. Three recent papers report the crystal structures of XPD from archaea. Apart from anticipated helicase domains the structures reveal a 4FeS cluster and novel "Arch" domain. The structures help our understanding of genotype­phenotype relationships in the XPD gene. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction

Nucleotide excision repair is the pathway that removes most types of damage generated in DNA by exogenous agents. The mechanism of NER and the functions of the 30 or so polypeptides that are involved are understood in some detail, though many aspects of its regulation remain to be elucidated. The crystal structures of only a few of the participants have been solved so far. The importance of NER in man is underlined by the genetic disorders associated with defects in NER, namely xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD) [1]. Central to understanding of these disorders is the XPD gene, mutations in which can result in XP, TTD, XP with CS, XP with TTD and Cerebro-oculofacial-skeletal syndrome (COFS), with wide variations in clinical features and severity [2­4]. XPD, together with XPB and TTDA are components of the 10-subunit transcription factor TFIIH, which has roles in NER, basal transcription, activated transcription and possibly cell cycle control [5]. It has been hypothesised that XP results from mutations that affect repair alone and that TTD arises from mutations that generate subtle tissuespecific deficiencies in transcription [6,7]. In TTD TFIIH levels are substantially reduced [8], leading to the suggestion that TTD mutations destabilise the TFIIH complex. These ideas

are supported by the finding from XPD mutation spectra that each mutation is specific for a particular disease phenotype [2]. However there are no disease-specific domains, most of the mutations clustering in the C-terminal third of the protein. Indeed adjacent mutations can result in different phenotypes. Thus D601N is a mild XP-specific mutation, whereas G602R is a mutation found in a severe XP-CS patient. Furthermore no disease mutations were detected between aa 260 and 460. Three recent reports on the crystal structure of archaeal XPDs, from the labs of White, Tainer and Kisker represent major milestones in our understanding of this crucial protein and help to explain the disease specificity of the individual mutations [9­11].

XPD structural domains

XPD is a 5 -3 DNA helicase and its structure was modelled several years ago on that of the UvrB helicase from Escherichia coli [12]. The new crystal structures show that, as predicted, part of the structure has a RecA-like fold found in the SF1 and SF2 family of helicases, with two domains (HD1 and HD2) separated by a cleft containing the residues that bind ATP (Fig. 1A shows the structure obtained by Fan et al. using XPD from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius [9], which is very similar to those

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.) from Sulfolobus tokodaii [10] and Thermoplasma acidophilum [11]). However two new domains revealed in the structures are a 4FeS cluster between aa 109 and 202 (numbers correspond to aa in the human protein), previously identified biochemically by the White group 2 years ago [13], and a novel "Arch domain" between aa 246 and 439, which represents a new protein fold. Interestingly, both these domains are inserted into the HD1 domain. The 4FeS cluster consists of six alpha helicases with four cysteines co-ordinating the Fe atoms. The Arch domain is also largely -helical with a 60 angle between two sets of helices, which gives rise to the arch-like structure. The importance of the 4FeS cluster is shown by loss of helicase activity when any of the co-ordinating cysteines is mutated [13], by the loss of structure of several parts of the molecule when the iron is oxidised [9] and by a common TTD-specific mutation (R112H) being localised in this cluster [13]. Although none of the groups obtained structures containing DNA, they all predicted more or less the same position for the DNA, with the ssDNA passing through the groove between the HD2 and Arch domains and then through a tunnel or hole encircled by the Arch, 4FeS and HD1 domains (Fig. 1B­D). It is proposed that either the hole itself or a pocket on the side of the hole [11] is able to recognise lesions in the DNA. Arginine112, which when mutated destroys the FeS cluster [13] and abolishes helicase activity [14], is part of the wall of this hole. The 4FeS domain is inserted between the HD1 Walker A and B motifs, suggesting that its conformation may change when ATP is bound or hydrolysed and the cluster may help open the dsDNA.

XPD mutations

XP-specific mutations (red spheres in Fig. 1A and red region in Fig. 1B) are found either on the faces of HD1 and HD2 that

1914

are predicted to interact with ss or dsDNA or are close to the ATP-binding pocket. These mutations drastically reduce helicase activity, as also shown previously [14]. Those mutations generating the XP/CS phenotype are clustered around the ATP binding site (yellow spheres in Fig. 1A and yellow region in Fig. 1C), but are also predicted to either produce or prevent important conformational changes. As pointed out previously, mutations in two of these patients convert glycines to aspartate or arginine, respectively [15,16], which will have a dramatic effect on the flexibility of the structure. Most of the TTD mutations are distributed within the body of the HD1 and HD2 domains (purple spheres in Fig. 1A and D) and are predicted to decrease the stability of the XPD protein framework, as indicated schematically in Fig. 1D. Often but not always this impacts on the helicase activity. Two TTD mutations are the only ones found in the 4FeS cluster (R112H) and Arch domains (C259Y), respectively. Interestingly aa 260­460 is to date devoid of any identified human mutations. This corresponds closely to much of the Arch domain (although C259Y is at the beginning of the Arch domain). This suggests that most of the Arch structure might be rather tolerant of minor structural alterations.

XPD interactions

The C-terminal part of XPD interacts with the N-terminal half of the p44 subunit within the TFIIH complex. This important interaction results in a 10-fold stimulation of the helicase activity of XPD [14,17]. Unfortunately the C-terminal 60 aa are not found in the Sulfolobus XPD, the last 30 aa are not conserved in T. acidophilum, and p44 orthologs are not found in the archaea used in these studies. The results of Dubaele et al. suggest that the interaction surface is disrupted by many of the mutations in the C-terminal 150 aa. Evidence also suggests that XPD interacts via its N-terminal domain with the MAT1 component of the three-subunit CAK sub-complex of TFIIH and acts to tether the CAK sub-complex to the six-subunit core of TFIIH [18]. The structure of the interacting surfaces between XPD and the other TFIIH components is an important missing piece in the puzzle, which will hopefully be solved in future studies.
