Abstract DNA damage occurs unceasingly in all cells. Spontaneous DNA base loss, as well as the removal of damaged DNA bases by specific enzymes targeted to distinct base lesions, creates non-coding and lethal apurinicrapyrimidinic ZAP. sites. AP sites are the central intermediate in DNA base excision repair ZBER. and must be processed by 5X AP endonucleases. These pivotal enzymes detect, recognize, and cleave the DNA phosphodiester backbone 5X of, AP sites to create a free 3X-OH end for DNA polymerase repair synthesis. In humans, AP sites are processed by APE1, whereas in yeast the primary AP endonuclease is termed APN1, and these enzymes are the major constitutively expressed AP endonucleases in these organisms and are homologous to the Escherichia coli enzymes Exonuclease III ZExo III. and Endonuclease IV ZEndo IV., respectively. These enzymes represent both of the conserved 5X AP endonuclease enzyme families that exist in biology. Crystal structures of APE1 and Endo IV, both bound to AP site-containing DNA reveal how abasic sites are recognized and the DNA phosphodiester backbone cleaved by these two structurally unrelated enzymes with distinct chemical mechanisms. Both enzymes orient the AP≠DNA via positively charged complementary surfaces and insert loops into the DNA base stack, bending and kinking the DNA to promote flipping of the AP site into a sequestered enzyme pocket that excludes undamaged nucleotides. Each enzyme≠DNA complex exhibits distinctly different DNA conformations, which may impact upon the biological functions of each enzyme within BER signal-transduction pathways. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

rial enzymes within a larger structural framework. Thus, human BER enzymes possess additional residues appended to their amino- or carboxyl-termini, which may in part mediate cooperative partnerships with other enzymes in the BER pathway. BER can conceptually be divided into two distinct stages. In the first step of DNA BER, many distinct DNA glycosylases and combined glycosylaserlyase enzymes w4≠6x distort DNA to detect and flip specific damaged bases out of the DNA helix, and into a sequestered enzyme active site pocket w7≠14x. Both pure and combined glycosylases cleave the N`C1X glycosylic bond to remove specific damaged DNA bases and create the central BER intermediate: an apurinicrapyrimidinic ZAP. site. All abasic sites are particularly cytotoxic since they can form abortive suicide products with mammalian topoisomerase I w15≠17x. In the second and damage-general step of BER, the DNA backbone must be cleaved 5X of AP sites to generate a free 3X OH end to initiate DNA repair synthesis. The combined glycosylaserAP lyase enzymes, such as Escherichia coli Endonuclease III ZEndo III., are erroneously classified as AP endonucleases, because they generate DNA strand breaks due to b-elimination of their base excision products w18,19x. These DNA strand breaks are, however, 3X of the abasic site, and create a ,b-unsaturated aldehydes that are not suitable 3X-OH ends to prime DNA polymerase repair synthesis w20,21x. These blocked 3X termini due to AP lyase activity, as well as true abasic sites created spontaneously and by pure DNA glycosylases, are processed by either one of two conserved 5X AP endonuclease enzyme families. The true BER AP endonucleases cleave 5X of blocked 3X termini and AP sites to generate the needed 3X-OH ends for DNA repair synthesis. The AP endonuclease termed Exonuclease III ZExo III. is the major constitutively expressed AP endonuclease in E. coli, and primarily functions as an AP endonuclease and a 3X-repair diesterase w22,23x. Exo III has additional enzyme activities including the efficient 3X 5X exonuclease activity for which it is named, a 3X-phosphomonoesterase activity, and an endonuclease activity at urea residues in DNA w24≠ 26x. In humans, the overwhelming majority of 5X AP endonuclease activity is provided by an Exo III homolog designated APE1 w27x, but also known by

TM

the names HAP1 w28x, REF1 w29x, and APEX w30x. APE1 lacks significant 3X 5X exonuclease activity w31x but does possess the other enzymatic activities of Exo III w27,32x. The importance of APE1 activity is underscored by the fact that expression of the APE1 protein in human cells is activated by DNA damaging agents and reactive oxygen species w33x, and homozygous APE1 knock-out mice are embryonic lethal w34x. Human APE1 specifically stimulates the activities of human uracil-DNA glycosylase w14x and thymine-DNA glycosylase w35x, likely through active displacement of the glycosylases from their tightly bound, AP≠DNA products. APE1 bound to abasic DNA also interacts with and stimulates w36x the DNA repair polymerase Polb, perhaps as part of a transient multienzyme complex with the scaffolding protein XRCC1 and DNA ligase III w37≠40x. These enzyme partnerships may ensure that toxic damaged DNA intermediates w20,41,42x are never left exposed in the cell w43≠45x. Indeed, these enzyme partnerships may be disrupted by overexpression of some DNA repair enzymes causing imbalances in DNA repair that, ironically, create mutator phenotypes w46,47x. While the primary AP endonuclease in humans is APE1, the archetype for the second conserved AP endonuclease family, Endo IV, is the major AP endonuclease in yeast and is induced in E. coli by DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species w48≠50x. Like APE1 and Exo III, purified Endo IV is a 5X AP endonuclease and a 3X-repair diesterase w51≠53x removing 3X DNA blocking groups such as 3X phosphates, 3X phosphoglycolates, and 3X a ,b unsaturated aldehydes w54,55x. Similar to APE1, but unlike Exo III, Endo IV is not a significant 3X 5X exonuclease, but has an additional activity that can cleave the DNA backbone 5X of the oxidative lesion a-deoxyadenosine w56x. This lesion arises when the chirality of the deoxyribose is inverted from the normal b configuration due to hydroxyl radical attack at the deoxyribose C1X atom. In Saccharomyces cere’isiae, the predominant constitutively expressed AP endonuclease is the Endo IV homolog, APN-1. Deletion of the S. cere’isiae apn1 gene increases the mutation rate with cells experiencing an ; 60 fold increase in AT GC transversion mutations w57x, and a hypersensitivity to alkylating agents and chemical oxidants w54x. In S.

cere’isiae, AP sites are likely removed by an alternate long-patch BER pathway that utilizes the structure-specific endonuclease FEN-1 w58≠60x, the polymerase processivity factor PCNA w61,62x, polymerase d or ¥ and replication factor C. This alternate BER pathway is initiated when APN-1 nicks the abasic DNA, and DNA polymerase synthesis displaces the 5X deoxyribose phosphate moiety onto a single stranded 5X flap. This 5X flap strand is removed by the structure-specific endonuclease FEN-1 w58≠60x, and repair synthesis completed by DNA polymerase and DNA ligase w63x. Notably, an Endo IV activity has not been detected in any mammalian cell and sequencing efforts have yet to identify any human Endo IV homologs. The lack of a human homolog coupled with the fact that Endo IV homologs exist in Caenorhabditis elegans, Candida albicans, and Plasmodium falciparum w64,65x, suggests that Endo IV may be a suitable target for the design of anti-fungal and anti-malarial agents. Recent structural results obtained for enzymes representative of these two conserved families of 5X AP endonucleases, both in their free forms w66≠68x and in complex with abasic DNA w68,69x, illustrates the biological importance of efficient AP site processing and provides precise atomic details for how these key enzymes function. Notably, these structural studies reveal important similarities and striking differences for both the initial detection and recognition of AP sites, and the chemical mechanism of phosphodiester bond cleavage. The fact that these two decidedly different enzymes have evolved independently to process AP sites highlights the biological need for creating proper 3X-OH ends to prime DNA repair synthesis. The ends really do justify the means. 2. The APE1 family of 5X AP-endonucleases The APE1 family of AP endonucleases are small, ; 30,000 to 40,000 Da, monomeric, divalent-metal ion dependent enzymes, which can be inactivated by metal-chelating agents. The structure of Exo III w70x revealed the characteristic four-layered a ,b-sandwich fold, which is conserved in the human homolog APE1 w67x, and is also seen in a digestive enzyme: the sequence-dependent endonuclease deoxyribonuclease I ZDNase I. from bovine pancreas w71,72x.

The similar three-dimensional fold is pseudo-symmetric about two central b-sheets and the surrounding a-helices, but substantially different loops and a-helices protrude from APE1 and Exo III than from DNase I ZFig. 1A.. These loops define the positively charged grooves that form the DNA-binding faces of the enzymes, and dictate each enzyme's specificity. Other members of this homologous AP endonuclease family include the Arp protein of A. thaliana w73x, the Rrp1 protein of D. melanogaster w74,75x, as well as enzymes from bacteria w76x and mammals w30x. Based on sequence similarity and a similar endonucleolytic activity, this four-layered a ,b-sandwich fold likely also exists in the semi-specific endonuclease that initiates retrotransposition by the human L1 retrotransposon w77x. The L1 endonuclease nicks DNA at oligoZdT.:oligoZdA. junctions in DNA, which are known sites of retrotransposon integration w78,79x. These distantly related enzymes share limited amino acid sequence similarity Z; 15≠20% identity., but their functions are ultimately tied to binding to DNA and cleaving the DNA phosphodiester backbone. Accordingly, conserved amino acids essential for nucleolytic activity are concentrated around the active site and divalent metal-ion binding site. Models for the specific recognition of abasic DNA by 5X AP endonucleases range from: Z1. intercalation of an aromatic residue side-chain into the DNA base stack at the abasic site w80x, Z2. non-specific recognition of an extra-helical base opposite the abasic site, Z3. enzyme-induced distortion of the DNA w70x, to Z4. specific recognition of a flipped-out abasic sugar w67x. In DNase I≠DNA co-crystal structures, most enzyme contacts are made with the DNA minor groove 5X of the active site, widening the minor groove and bending the DNA w81,82x. Exo III and APE1 have similar minor-groove binding loops, but differ from DNase I in several important respects. First, DNase I has limited amino acid sequence similarity and structural homology with Exo IIIr APE1. Second, the DNA-binding region of DNase I is about half of the enzyme surface. In the other half of the structure, where DNase I makes a tight turn, the AP endonucleases contain an insertion that protrudes out to contact the DNA. Inserting additional residues into this region of DNase I lowers DNase activity 800-fold w83x. Thirdly, DNase I does not

214

bind extrahelical nucleotides and does not have 5X AP endonuclease activity. Recent structural and mutational results for a human APE1 complex with abasic DNA show how the unique features of this class of 5X AP endonucleases function in AP site recognition, binding and catalysis.

2.1. APE1 recognition of Abasic DNA Crystal structures of human APE1 bound to synthetic abasic site-containing DNA, both with and without the divalent metal ion, show how APE1 recognizes abasic sites and cleaves the target bond

w69x. In the co-crystal structures, APE1 binds a flipped-out abasic nucleotide with residues penetrating both the DNA minor and major grooves to engulf the extrahelical AP site in a sequestered active site pocket ZFig. 1B.. The APE1≠DNA interface is centered around the extrahelical abasic deoxyribose and its flanking phosphates, which contribute nearly one-third of the buried surface area of the complex. The interface encompasses both DNA strands but most contacts are made with the AP≠ DNA strand ZFig. 1C.. These results agree with solution data from footprinting experiments, which show that APE1 contacts two DNA phosphates 3X of the AP site w84x and that ; 3 base-pairs 3X and ; 4 base-pairs 5X of the AP site are needed for bond cleavage w85x. APE1 is preformed for recognizing and binding ∞ abasic DNA. The enzyme only deviates ; 0.7 A in C a atom positions between the AP≠DNA bound and free enzyme structures, but the AP≠DNA structure is severely distorted from a standard B-DNA helix. The enzyme-bound AP≠DNA is bent ; 358 ∞ and there is a large ; 5 A displacement, or kinking, of the DNA helical axis, where the two inserted APE1 loops cap the extrahelical abasic site ZFig. 1B,C.. The kinked AP≠DNA structure is stabilized on the 5X side by an a-helix, which braces the DNA backbone, and a loop, which spans and widens the DNA minor groove ZFig. 1B.. These contacts anchor the DNA for the bending and extreme kinking centered on the extrahelical AP site. At the AP site an APE1 loop buttresses the DNA backbone for

double-loop insertion of methionine residues into the DNA minor groove ZMet270 and Met271., and an arginine residue into the DNA major groove ZArg177.. The arginine side chain delivers a charged hydrogen bond to the non-target DNA phosphate group 3X of the AP site ZFig. 2A. stabilizing the extrahelical conformation of the AP site, and effectively locking APE1 onto the AP≠DNA. At the APE1 active site, direct hydrogen bonds from conserved APE1 residues, as well as from the divalent metal ion, to all four oxygen atoms of the 3X AP site phosphate orient and polarize the target scissile P`O3X bond for cleavage ZFig. 2A, see Section 4.2.. APE1 specifically binds the extrahelical abasic site in a pocket bordered by aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid residues that pack with the hydrophobic side of the abasic deoxyribose ZFig. 2A.. 2.2. APE1 coordination of DNA repair steps The recognition of DNA bases through nucleotide flipping is a common method for damage detection employed by DNA glycosylases and glycosylaser lyases w44x. Flipping abasic nucleotides out of the DNA helix is not obviously required, however, by APE1 and other DNA backbone cleaving endonucleases, and flipping is not seen in DNA co-crystal structures of DNase I w81,82,86x, the structurally unrelated Very Short Patch DNA Repair endonuclease w87x, or in sequence-specific DNA backbone cleaving restriction endonucleases w88≠92x. Abasic nucleotide flipping by APE1 allows for the sharp

DNA kinking at the damage locus. Both the amount of helical displacement, and the extent of the APE1: DNA interface, are larger than that seen in DNA complexes with damage-specific DNA glycosylases w10,12,14,93x, suggesting that APE1 may competitively displace these enzymes from their inhibitory AP-site products leading to the observed APE1 enhancement of DNA glycosylase activities w14,35x.

Moreover, the tight packing of the abasic deoxyribose in the APE1 active site excludes normal DNA nucleotides from binding, and appears specific for the a anomer of natural AP sites that are the direct product of DNA glycosylases, suggesting that in vivo the AP site is passed directly to APE1 from the damage-specific DNA glycosylases. This partner exchange of DNA substrates between BER enzymes

avoids the release of repair intermediates into solution where abasic sites can racemize into the disfavored b configuration. The effects on enzyme activity of site-directed alanine mutants of the APE1 residues that penetrate the DNA minor groove ZMet270, Met271., and DNA major groove ZArg177. showed, surprisingly, that none of these residues are required to flip AP sites out of the DNA helix ZFig. 2B.. These data suggest that APE1 functions as a structure-specific nuclease targeted to DNA that can adopt the kinked conformation while simultaneously presenting a flipped-out AP site to the APE1 recognition pocket. Both the Met270Ala and Met271Ala mutant enzymes are as active as wild-type APE1 enzyme, but the specific activity of the Arg177Ala mutant enzyme is increased relative to wild-type ZFig. 2B.. Thus, the Arg177 intercalation into the DNA base stack and DNA phosphate interaction apparently slows APE1 dissociation from the cleaved product w94x, and enzyme kinetic analysis indeed shows that the Arg177Ala mutant is a more efficient enzyme than wild-type APE1 ZFig. 2B.. The conformation and amino acid sequence of the Arg177 loop in APE1 is not conserved in Exo III or in other non-mammalian members of this AP endonuclease family, suggesting

that the interactions of Arg177 reflect a biological function in human cells. As evolutionary selective pressure acts at the level of biological function rather than single enzyme rates, these results support a biological role for tight product binding by APE1. Thus, the biological need to coordinate APE1 with downstream DNA BER enzymes w36,43,95x has evidently guided evolution of the APE1 structure, rather than maximizing catalytic efficiency and allowing rapid release of toxic, incised DNA products. These results suggest the molecular basis for the orderly transfer of DNA damage from DNA glycosylases to APE1 and from APE1 to Polb. The more extensive APE1 interaction surface and pronounced kinking of the DNA helix relative to DNA glycosylases allow APE1 to stage human DNA repair by first displacing a bound glycosylase from its product AP site. Secondly, the APE1 anti-catalytic adaptation of tight product binding and interaction of the APE1: DNA complex with Polb then recruits the DNA repair synthesis enzymes to areas of damaged DNA ZFig. 2C.. The high relative amounts of APE1 per cell Z350,000 to 7,000,00. w32x compared to Polb Z; 50,000 molecules. w96x, suggest that functionally relevant APE1 interactions with Polb largely depend upon the distorted DNA conformation as APE1 is

Stereo view of the APE1 active site illustrating interactions with the flipped-out abasic deoxyribose and target 5X phosphate. The hydrophobic face of the extrahelical AP site packs within a complementary APE1 pocket formed by the side chains of Phe166, Trp280, and X Leu282. The side chain of Arg177 inserts through the DNA major groove to form a hydrogen bond to the non-target AP site 3 phosphate. X X The target AP site 5 phosphate O5 and O2P atoms form hydrogen bonds with Asn174 Nd2 and Asn212 Nd2, respectively, while His309 forms a direct hydrogen bond to a third phosphate oxygen. Asp210, which is positioned to activate a water molecule ZHOH. for the cleavage reaction, is oriented by hydrogen bonds from the Asn212 backbone amide and the Nd2 atom of Asn68, which also delivers a hydrogen bond X to the metal ligand Glu96. The metal ion stabilizes the transition state and faciltates the O3 leaving group, perhaps through a first hydration 2q shell water molecule of a Mg ion in vivo. ZB.

Results are the average of three independent experiments with ranges as indicated by the error bars. Enzyme kinetic analyses of Arg177Ala were performed as described for wild-type APE1 w114x. ZC. Model for Coordination of DNA Repair steps by APE1. In the first step of BER, a damage-specific DNA repair enzyme such as UDG removes a damaged base but remains bound to and presents the product abasic DNA to APE1. Owing to the more extensive APE1: DNA interaction surface that encompasses both DNA strands and the more pronounced DNA kinking, APE1 dislodges the bound UDG, allowing it to release the cleaved uracil base Zred dot. and detect another uracil-containing nucleotide. After cleavage of the DNA phosphodiester backbone, APE1 presents its product nicked DNA to DNA polymerase b andror possibly XRCC1, which also tightly binds nicked DNA. This product≠substrate exchange may be partially mediated through the APE1 N-terminus and the Polb deoxyribophosphodiesterase domain. Polb increases DNA bending to the ; 908 observed in Polb: DNA complexes. Through these known interactions of APE1: DNA with Polb, and of XRCC1 with both Polb and DNA ligase III, the DNA repair synthesis enzymes can assemble at the site of DNA damage. Following repair and religation, the DNA can no longer accommodate the bending and the component enzymes likely dissociate, but are now localized to a region of damaged DNA and can reassemble at the next lesion. APE1 may remain associated with the complex or be freed to dislodge the next glycosylase.

218

unchanged upon binding abasic DNA. APE1 can stage repair synthesis by presenting the ; 358 bent and kinked nicked abasic DNA to Polb, such that the smaller polymerase deoxyribophosphodiesterase domain contacts the APE1: DNA complex 3X of the AP site, dislodges APE1, and increases the DNA bending to the ; 908 needed to form an active Polb: DNA complex ZFig. 2C.. The APE1 N-terminus, which is unique to mammalian APE1 enzymes, extends towards the DNA where it could non-specifically bind the DNA backbone and mediate interactions with Polb, and possibly also with XRCC1, which tightly binds nicked APE1 product DNA w37x. Through the known interactions w37≠39x of Polb, XRCC1, and DNA ligase III, the entire DNA repair synthesis machinery can be assembled ZFig. 2C.. The majority of DNA BER synthesis replaces only the single damaged nucleotide w97x, and the religated and repaired DNA can no longer accommodate the ; 908 bend to bind Polb. Thus, lacking an amenable DNA substrate, the component BER enzymes likely dissociate after repair synthesis, yet may remain localized to regions of damaged DNA to reform at, and more efficiently repair, other sites of DNA damage.

The three Endo IV active site Zn2q ions are precisely situated within the deep groove to effect phosphodiester bond cleavage. Two of the Zn atoms are bridged by a tightly bound water molecule ZFig. 3B., which is likely deprotonated in the enzyme active site, and acts as the nucleophile in the hydrolysis reaction. The third Zn atom is not involved in activation of the catalytic water, but plays a key role by stabilizing the 3X hydroxyl leaving group liberated in the reaction Zsee Section 4.2.. The arrangement of the active site Zn2q ions in Endo IV is similar to that seen in two other trinuclear Zn cluster-containing enzymes: P1 nuclease from Penicillium citrinum w102,103x, and phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus w104≠106x. Neither of these enzymes are a 8 b 8 TIM barrels, and completely lack any structural homology to Endo IV. Like Endo IV, however, these enzymes employ three Zn2q ions for phosphodiester bond cleavage, and utilize a Zn-bridging hydroxide ion as the active nucleophile w103,107x, illustrating how the trinuclear Zn cluster may be an optimal motif for cutting the DNA phosphodiester backbone. The structure of Endo IV bound to abasic DNA revealed the specific structural adaptations of the Endo IV TIM barrel that allow it to recognize and bind AP sites in DNA. 3.1. Endo IV recognition of Abasic DNA

3. Endonuclease IV family of AP-endonucleases Endo IV is a small, ; 30,000 Da Zn2q-dependent endonuclease that, unlike the Mg 2q-dependent APE1 family of AP endonucleases, resists inactivation by EDTA w98x. The structure of Endo IV from E. coli, ∞ determined to ultra-high 1.0-A resolution, provides the highest resolution atomic description yet obtained for any DNA repair or Zn-containing enzyme w68x. The structure revealed that Endo IV is a single domain ab protein with secondary structure elements arranged as a b-barrel having eight parallel b-strands surrounded by eight peripheral a-helices ZFig. 3A.. Although this common fold was first observed in Triose Phosphate Isomerase ZTIM. w99x, and occurs in many enzyme families of diverse function w100,101x, Endo IV is the firt structure to reveal how the ubiquitous TIM barrel fold can be used for binding a large macromolecule such as DNA, and it is the first TIM barrel structure containing a trinuclear Zn2q cluster at its active site ZFig. 3B..

The recently determined crystal structure of Endo IV bound to a synthetic abasic site-containing DNA revealed the structural features that underlie AP site recognition and cleavage by this conserved family of 5X AP endonucleases w68x. In the Endo IV: DNA complex structure, the AP≠DNA is not kinked but instead is bent by ; 908 with both the abasic site and its partner nucleotide flipped out of the DNA helix ZFig. 4A.. Binding to abasic DNA is mediated by five DNA recognition loops that emanate from the carboxyl-terminal face of the Endo IV b-barrel. These loops form the walls of a positively charged crescent-shaped groove that complements the negatively charged phosphate backbone of doublestranded DNA ZFig. 4B.. Residues on these recognition loops contact nucleotides on both DNA strands through both direct and water mediated interactions, and brace the DNA in the dramatically bent conformation seen in the structure. In the enzyme active

site, the AP site phosphodiester bond has been cleaved and the extensive set of contacts to both DNA strands serve to anchor the liberated 5X phosphate to all three active site Zn2q ions ZFig. 4C.. Unlike the DNA binding surface of APE1, which is preformed for abasic site binding and recognition, Endo IV undergoes striking local conformational changes that allow two of the DNA recognition

loops to insert residues into the base stack through the DNA minor groove. Conserved enzyme residues occupy the gap left by the flipped out AP site and its orphan nucleotide partner, and undergo considerable backbone and side chain shifts from their positions in the free Endo IV structure to those seen in the DNA complex. As a result of this double-loop penetration, the DNA minor groove is grossly deformed,

∞ becoming ; 5.5 A wider than normal B-DNA. Despite the extrahelical conformation of both the AP site and its partner nucleotide, stacking interactions with both base pairs 3X and 5X of the AP site are preserved in the complex as Tyr72 and Ile73 stack with and stabilize the base pair 5X of the AP site, while Arg 37 makes key stacking interactions with the 3X base pair. Consistent with biochemical results showing that Endo IV has no preference for the base

opposite an AP site w56x, no specific contacts are made to the orphan base. The extrahelical conformation of this orphan nucleotide is likely stabilized by Trp39, whose backbone amide and side chain indole nitrogen atoms also move from their positions in the unbound enzyme structure to interact with the two phosphates flanking the orphan nucleotide. Endo IV specifically recognizes AP sites in dsDNA by binding the flipped out sugar in a se-

questered pocket that sterically excludes binding of normal b-configuration nucleotides. The Endo IV pocket is lined with conserved residues that pack against the deoxyribose and, unlike APE1, both the a and b anomers of deoxyribose can be accommodated in the enzyme active site. Endo IV is the only known enzyme that is active against damaged nucleotides with bases in the a configuration, and this form of DNA damage, which results from oxidative processes w56x, can fit in a solvent accessible pocket on the enzyme surface. Endo IV's 3X repair diesterase activity is also explained by the active site structure as the sequestered pocket can accommodate any base-free nucleotide such as 3X a ,b-unsaturated aldehydes, 3X phosphates, and 3X phosphoglycolates. All these substrates would fit in the AP site binding pocket, and importantly they retain the normal spacing of the DNA backbone atoms allowing the target phosphate to be intimately coordinated by the three Zn2q ions, and these interactions are critical for catalysis.

specific protein fold recurs, which is optimized for binding and cutting DNA. Thus, variations on this structural theme have been exploited to evolve enzymes involved not only in DNA repair, but extends to enzymes that degrade DNA in digestion or target DNA for transposable element integration in host genomes. The ubiquitous a 8 b 8 TIM barrel fold, which is more commonly found in enzymes that bind and phosphorylate sugars in glycolysis and phospholipid headgroups, is unexpectedly revealed by the Endo IV structure as being ideal for binding to DNA. The TIM barrel fold orients all of the positive ahelical dipoles towards one enzyme face, which complements and neutralizes the negatively charged DNA sugar-phosphate backbone. Thus, these new 5X AP endonuclease structures in complex with abasic DNA provide new insights into how two astonishingly different protein folds accomplish the same biological function. 4.1. AP site detection: DNA bending and kinking A fundamental problem in molecular recognition is the detection of a substrate that lacks specific recognition elements. While damage-specific DNA glycosylase enzymes, such as uracil-DNA glycosylase, can be targeted to the distinct physical and chemical attributes of damaged DNA bases w14,44, 108x, abasic sites are featureless holes in doublestranded DNA. Lacking the Watson≠Crick base-pairing and DNA base-stacking interactions of normal nucleotides, AP sites impart increased deformability to the DNA helix. This inherent property of AP

4. The disunion of fold and function: two means to an 3X end The guiding premise of X-ray crystallographic analyses is that knowledge of structure will clarify function; yet structures of the two major classes of 5X AP endonucleases reveal that nature is not so particular about how a needed function is achieved, it merely requires that the function be fulfilled. In the case of the APE1 class of 5X AP endonucleases, a

DNA is exploited by the 5X AP endonucleases for AP site detection and both APE1 and Endo IV dramatically distort their DNA substrates to detect and recognize AP sites in DNA. Importantly, as the

structures of both APE1 and Endo IV were determined bound to the exact same abasic DNA oligonucleotide ZFig. 5., and since the DNA conformations in each complex are distinctly different, these

complex structures clearly indicated that rather than recognizing a pre-existing solution conformation of AP DNA, 5X AP endonucleases induce the necessary structural distortions required for AP site detection and recognition. The AP DNA-bound structures of APE1 and Endo IV suggest that the 5X AP endonucleases are specific for AP sites by imposing structural distortions onto the DNA helix within the constraints of enzyme active sites that select against normal DNA nucleotides. Both enzymes insert loops into the DNA minor groove, and maintain the orientation of their electrostatically positive DNA-binding surfaces towards the DNA. The APE1 and Endo IV enzyme: DNA contact surfaces are surprisingly similar ZFig. 5., and clearly reflect the importance of these minor-groove interactions for binding abasic DNA, despite the distinctly different DNA conformations in the APE1 and Endo IV complexes. Given these results, and since the structure of the DNA minor groove is much more uniform than the major groove, these enzyme: DNA contacts suggest that both APE1 and Endo IV efficiently scan for AP sites by using their minor-groove penetrating loops to slightly distort the DNA minor groove. These distortions would place mechanical strain on the DNA, enabling each enzyme to probe for weak points in the DNA helix that can accommodate the full bending and kinking required to form catalytically competent complexes. APE1 may efficiently scan for AP sites by skimming along the DNA minor groove. APE1 binds the DNA minor groove 5X of the AP site, via the conserved minor-groove widening loop. Such minorgroove widening 5X of the target nucleotide is likely

a conserved feature of the four-layered ab-sandwich fold, as similar yet distinct DNA minor-groove interactions are also seen in DNase I: DNA complexes w81,82x, and in Exo III: DNA complexes ZC.D. Mol, R.P. Cunningham, and J.A. Tainer unpublished results.. This penetration of the DNA minor groove anchors one-half of APE1 to the DNA, while the electrostatic attraction between the positive APE1 DNA-binding face and the negative DNA phosphodiester backbone ensures that the entire enzyme remains oriented towards the DNA. In this half-bound configuration APE1 can skim processively w109x along the DNA scanning for regions that can accommodate the kinking induced by the three APE1 DNA recognition loops 3X of the target nucleotide. Only abasic DNA can be deformed in this manner within the constraints of the APE1 abasic nucleotide-binding pocket ZFig. 2A.. In contrast, Endo IV detection of AP sites may be mediated by contacts with the DNA minor groove 3X of the AP site. Endo IV inserts residues from two loops into the minor groove, and these enzyme: DNA contacts would slightly expand the minor groove of normal DNA and cause initial DNA bending. Upon detecting an AP site, increased DNA bending and double-nucleotide flipping likely occur simultaneously with full penetration of the DNA base stack by the Arg37 and Tyr72 loops. Finally, interactions between key loop residues and the DNA backbone 5X of the AP site leads to full DNA bending and formation of a productive complex. Thus, as proposed for APE1 Endo IV can also skim the DNA minor groove in a half-bound configuration, but, unlike APE1, initial detection is likely mediated by

the DNA recognition loops penetrating the DNA minor groove 3X of the AP site. 4.2. AP site clea’age: one Mg 2 q or three Zn 2 q ions Analyses of both the cleaved and uncleaved AP≠ DNA complexes of both APE1 and Endo IV reveals that they employ similar strategies to cleave the target scissile P`O3X bond. Despite distinctly different structural chemistries at their active sites, the proposed reaction mechanisms both involve enzyme-activated hydroxyl nucleophile attack of the target phosphorus atom, leading to an inversion of

the configuration of the phosphate group, with a metal-ion stabilizing the developing negative charge at the O3X leaving group ZFig. 6.. For APE1 we propose a structure-based reaction scheme that is consistent with mutagenesis results w31,110,111x, in which the conserved Asp≠His pair previously thought to activate the attacking hydroxyl nucleophile w67,70,82x, instead delivers a direct hydrogen bond from the histidine side chain to a phosphate oxygen atom ZFig. 6A.. Direct hydrogen bonds from other conserved APE1 residues, as well as from the divalent metal ion, to all four oxygen atoms of the target phosphate orient and polarize the scissile P`O3X bond for cleavage, with only the side

chain of Asp210 favorably aligned to deprotonate a water molecule to generate the attacking hydroxyl nucleophile ZFig. 6A.. Held in position by hydrogen bonds, the p K a of the buried Asp210 side-chain carboxylate would be elevated, and along with the Asp≠His phosphate interaction, likely results in the observed maximal APE1 activity at pH 7.5, with a pH 6.7 to 9 activity profile w112x. The divalent metal ion dictates the directionality of bond cleavage by stabilizing the O3X leaving group, either by direct ligation or via a water in the first hydration shell of a Mg 2q ion ZFig. 6A.. In the Endo IV: DNA complex, the target P`O3X bond is cleaved and the now terminal phosphate is ligated by all three Zn2q ions. As with APE1, the target AP site 5X phosphate is intimately coordinated by enzyme residues and the bound metal ions. Two of the target phosphate oxygen atoms are bridging ligands between adjacent Zn2q ions, which together with the active site chemistry, suggests an elegant mechanism in which hydrolysis proceeds through a pentacoordinate transition state where one bridging phosphate oxygen remains bound to its cognate metal ions ZFig. 6B.. Initial binding of Endo IV to an extrahelical AP site is constrained by the intact target P`O3X covalent bond, and in the pre-transition state the bridging hydroxide would be positioned favorably for an in-line attack on the phosphorus atom ZFig. 6B.. Glu261, which is also a Zn ligand, may assist in orienting and activating the attacking nucleophile, while charge neutralization of the phosphate group by the three Zn2q ions likely renders the phosphorus atom susceptible to nucleophilic substitution. As with APE1, the reaction proceeds through an inversion of the stereochemical configuration of the phosphate group, and the developing negative charge at O3X is stabilized by interactions with a metal ion ZFig. 6B.. Thus, all three Zn2q ions participate directly in a three-metal-ion mechanism for phosphodiester hydrolysis by the Endo IV 5X AP endonuclease family.

5. Future perspectives Taken together, these 5X AP endonuclease and 5X AP endonuclease: DNA complex structures reveal that specificity for AP sites results from concerted

changes in the DNA ZAPE1 and Endo IV. and also in the enzyme ZEndo IV.. These conformational changes are damage dependent, and are dictated by the precise size and shape of of the abasic nucleotide-binding pocket and on the structural chemistry that occurs at the active sites of the individual enzymes. For APE1 and human BER, it appears that transient and complex interactions with other BER enzymes are being delineated that reveal a higher level of DNA repair organization. Similar studies with Endo IV, performed with purified enzymes from relevant organisms, will determine whether such apparent coordination of DNA repair steps is an inherent property of the APE1 fold, or a biological necessity that transcends enzyme structure. Such studies may be particularly relevant in yeast where the Endo IV homolog APN1 is the dominant 5X AP endonuclease. The occurence of DNA damage is a relatively rare event, regardless of genome size, and the involvement of APE1 in stimulating DNA glycosylases and DNA polymerase activity in humans may reflect the need to coordinate DNA repair for maximal efficiency in relatively large mammalian genomes. In the smaller genomes of prokaryotes and yeast it may be sufficient to allow the BER enzymes to function independently. Even in organisms that possess enzymes from both the APE1 and Endo IV classes of 5X AP endonucleases, the expression of the secondary enzyme is tightly regulated. Thus, having high cellular levels of competing AP endonucleases may actually imbalance DNA repair and increase mutation rates. As pointed out by Lindahl and Wood w113x, human DNA repair lacks homologs for many of the simpler bacterial enzymes that repair UV-induced DNA damage, and this likely reflects human evolution from small, furry, nocturnal mammals which were under little evolutionary selective pressure to preserve efficient repair of UV damage. The prospect of enhancing human DNA repair could focus on targeted gene therapy that introduces enzymes like Endo IV into the human genome. However, given the apparent role of enzyme partnerships in maintaining human genome integrity, such an approach may actually adversely affect the efficient DNA repair pathways already operating in the cell. Thus, the potential for such genetic processes to improve the
