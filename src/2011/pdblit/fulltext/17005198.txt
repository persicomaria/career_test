The Rcs signalling pathway controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis, cell division or motility in prokaryotes. The Rcs regulation cascade, involving a multi-step phosphorelay between the two membrane-bound hybrid sensor kinases RcsC and RcsD and the global regulator RcsB, is, up to now, one of the most complicated regulatory systems in bacteria. To understand the structural basis of Rcs signal transduction, NMR spectroscopy was employed to determine the solution structure of the RcsC C terminus, possessing a phosphoreceiver domain (RcsC-PR), and a region previously described as a long linker between the histidine kinase domain of RcsC (RcsC-HK) and the RcsC-PR. We have found that the linker region comprises an independent structural domain of a new / organization, which we named RcsC-ABL domain (Alpha/ Beta/Loop). The ABL domain appears to be a conserved and unique structural element of RcsC-like kinases with no significant sequence homology to other proteins. The second domain of the C terminus, the RcsC-PR domain, represents a well-folded CheY-like phosphoreceiver domain with the central parallel -sheet covered with two -helical layers on both sides. We have mapped the interaction of RcsC-ABL and RcsC-PR with the histidine phosphotransfer domain (HPt) of RcsD. In addition we have characterized the interaction with and the conformational effects of ­ Mg2+ and the phosphorylation mimetic BeF3 on RcsC-ABL and RcsC-PR.

type I capsular polysaccharides, 5­8 biofilm formation,4,9 motility,10­12 antibiotic resistance 13 and cell division.14 Positive as well as negative effects on gene expression have been described and additional indirect control mechanisms are likely through the modulation of other regulators by the Rcs system.15,16 The Rcs system represents, therefore, a major control element for the remodeling of the enterobacterial surface in response to host infection and other changing cellular environments. The Rcs regulatory pathway is a complex modification of the standard bacterial two-component signaling systems. Key elements are the two 900 amino acid membrane bound sensor kinases RcsC and RcsD (formerly YojN), the cytoplasmic transcriptional regulator RcsB and its co-activator RcsA.

69 ulator proteins like the outer membrane associated protein RcsF20,21 and the co-activator RcsA, which binds together with RcsB at a conserved motif in a subset of regulated promoters 5,22 modulate the signal transfer in specific pathways of the Rcs regulon. Hence, the Rcs system is one of the most complex and multi-valent bacterial signal transduction pathways. It has been speculated that the biggest advantage of such a complex phosphorelay system involving several different domains and proteins compared to standard two component signal transduction systems is increased flexibility and a higher number of potential regulation sites. As a basis for understanding the complex RcsC phosphorelay network we have started to structurally characterize its individual components and to map their interaction with each other. In previous work, we had solved the structure of the RcsD-HPt domain by liquid state NMR spectroscopy and mapped its interaction interface with a truncated RcsC700-949 protein construct that contains the RcsC-PR domain and the approximately 130 amino acid long previously undefined linker region between RcsC-PR and RcsC-HK.23 Based on the unusual length of this linker we suspected the presence of additional structural features and started a detailed structural investigation of the entire C terminus of RcsC. Here we present the structure of the complete C-terminal fragment spanning amino acid residues 700­949 (RcsC700-949).

distinct membrane compounds18,19 are detected by the periplasmic sensor domains of RcsC/RcsD and activate the signaling cascade. This signal transfer is mediated by a RcsC/RcsD/RcsB phospho-relay cascade (Figure 1) involving conserved integrated phosphate shuttle domains. Signal perception initiates the autophosphorylation of the RcsC histidine kinase (RcsC-HK) domain at the conserved residue His479 that subsequently transfers the phosphoryl group to the conserved residue Asp875 in the Cterminally located phosphoreceiver domain (RcsCPR). The C-terminal histidine phosphotransferase domain of RcsD (RcsD-Hpt) serves as a phosphate shuttle between RcsC-PR and the receiver domain of the response regulator RcsB (RcsB-PR). This multi-step, intermolecular His-Asp-His-Asp phosphorelay pathway is one of several distinct features of the Rcs signalling system. In addition, the arrangement of the hybrid sensor kinases RcsC and RcsD is very unusual and the presence of a terminal phosphoreceiver domain was so far only described for two other prokaryotic sensors, VirA of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and LuxN of Vibrio harveyi. RcsC is proposed to form a heterodimeric complex with RcsD in order to facilitate the phosphotransfer between RcsC-PR and RcsD-HPt.12 Accessory reg-

Results
The global structure of RcsC700-949 Analysis of the linker region between the HK and PR domains of RcsC indicated the presence of an unknown structural domain between amino acid residues 700 and 825. Secondary structure prediction suggested the existence of both -strands and helices in this region. To characterize this potentially structured domain as well as the Rcsc-PR domain we expressed in bacteria the C-terminal fragment RcsC700-949. The structure determination by NMR spectroscopy of this 250 amino acid protein followed standard protocols. The CANDID module of CYANA24 1.05 was used for nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) peak assignments and simultaneous structure calculation resulting in 3617 unambiguous non-redundant upper limit constraints. In addition, 101 hydrogen bonds (based on proton­ deuterium exchange data and the results of secondary structure prediction with the CSI program25) and 276 angle constraints predicted by TALOS26 were used for the final structure calculation with the program DYANA 2.6.27 The structure was refined by energy minimization with CNS/ARIA.28 The result of these structure calculations is shown in Figure 2, and the structural statistics are given in Table 1A. The C-terminal region of RcsC contains two independent, well-structured domains of

71 The ABL domain is an evolutionary conserved feature in the RcsC regulatory network The structure of the isolated RcsC-ABL domain is presented in Figure 3(a) and (b) and structural statistics are provided in Table 1B. The central element of the RcsC-ABL structure is the fivestranded parallel -sheet with a 21345 topology, including strands 1­5 (residues Arg708-Ala712, Val732­Thr735, Val746­Asp750, Ala761­Phe765 and Glu780­His783, respectively). Packed against one side of this sheet are two helices 1 (residues Ala716­Leu726) and 2 (residues Leu791­Tyr799) while the remaining connection between the individual -strands is provided by three loops L1, L2 and L3 (residues Tyr736­ Asp745, Glu751­Arg760 and Cys761­Gly779, respectively), all located on the opposite side of the -sheet (Figure 3(c)). Residues Val713­Asn715, Gln727­Ile731 and Ser784­Glu790 form tight turns connecting strand 1 and helix 1, 1 and 2, 5 and 2, respectively. The loops L1­L3 are enriched in proline and glycine residues, emphasizing the absence of regular secondary structure elements. In total, five out of six proline residues and four out of eight glycine residues of RcsC-ABL are allocated in these loops. The hydrophobic cluster of the molecule is composed of the inner surfaces of the -helices (residues Leu718, Cys719, Leu722 and Leu726 from 1, and Leu791, Leu794, Leu795, Ala796 and Ile798 from 2), the -strands (3 and 4, and parts of 1, 2 and 5) and some residues from the loops (Pro741 from L1; Trp757, Val753 and Lys757 from L2; Ile772, Pro773 and Leu774 from L3). The participation of the loops in these hydrophobic interactions stabilizes their conformation, resulting in low root-meansquare deviation (RMSD) values (the highest RMSD value for the individual residues, for His769 in L3, amounts to 1.43 Å for backbone atoms and 3.52 Å for all heavy atoms). A structural similarity search using DALI 30 identified about 540 different protein structures with similarity to the RcsC-ABL domain. Most homologous structures represent the flavodoxinlike fold with the highest similarity found in the CheY-like superfamily. Domains of this superfamily contain a five-stranded parallel -sheet surrounded by five -helices (three on one side of the -sheet and two on the other side). As discussed above the RcsC-ABL domain differs from this classical domain architecture by having three helices replaced with loops. The presence of these three loops remains a unique feature of the RcsC-ABL domains, distinguishing this type of protein architecture from the well-known CheY-like superfamily. Thus, the RcsCABL domain constitutes a new family within the CheY-like superfamily. To investigate if other proteins with a similar primary structure exist we searched the GenBank database for homologous sequences. Only 19 entries for RcsC proteins belonging to eight different species of the family of enterobacteria showed a

fold with five helices surrounding the central sheet, the N-terminal domain contains only two helices located on one side of the -sheet. All three helices on the other side of the -sheet seen in the RcsC-PR domain are replaced by loops. In order to emphasize this new topological feature, we have named the N-terminal domain ABL domain (Alpha/ Beta/Loop). Analysis of the NOE pattern of the linker connecting the RcsC-ABL and the RcsC-PR domains did not indicate any regular structure, suggesting that the two domains are structurally independent. To further investigate this structural independence the two domains were expressed separately and their [15N, 1H]- transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) and NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were compared to the spectrum of the two-domain protein. With the exception of the residues in the linker region close to the separation line of the two domains we could not detect any significant differences in the chemical shifts or NOE patterns between the isolated domains and the two-domain protein. These findings suggest that the two domains do not interact with each other within the complete Cterminal fragment RcsC700-949.

significant degree of identity of at least 25 % to the RcsC-ABL domain of Escherichia coli (Figure 4). Highest scores of approximately 68% were obtained for the ABL domains in RcsC of Salmonella thipi and Shigella flexneri. The poor overall identity of all eight sequences of only 6%, however, suggests a rather structural role of the RcsC-ABL domain. In contrast, the overall sequence identity among all eight different sequences of the flanking RcsC-HK domain and the RcsC-PR domain are quite high with 65% and 67%, respectively. The alignment of the eight RcsC-ABL sequences revealed only few conserved residues. The most prominent feature of the predicted ABL domains is the conservation of structurally important motifs, such as a hydrophobic surface in helix 1 and 2, or hydrogen bonds maintaining the fold. In addition, Gly730 and Gly771 in the tight turns between secondary structure elements are conserved (Figure 4). The RcsC-PR domain forms a classical phosphoreceiver structure The structure of the RcsC-PR domain is presented in Figure 5 and structural details are summarized in

Table 1C. The structure reveals that RcsC-PR is a typical member of the family of aspartate phosphotransferases which consists of a central fivestranded parallel -sheet, surrounded by five helices, forming an // sandwich with the Rossman fold (Figure 5(c)). One of the signature motifs of aspartate phosphotransferases, an Asp, Asp di-peptide sequence that is responsible for coordinating an essential Mg2+, is located at the end of strand 1. The phosphoaccepting Asp875 is located at the end of strand 3 and its side-chain is in close proximity to the Mg2+-coordinating motif. Lys925 and Thr903, which stabilize the aspartylphosphate group, are located at similar positions compared to other aspartate phosphotransferases. The close proximity between the side-chains of Lys925 and Asp831­832 as well as Asp875 is facilitated by the cis-conformation of Pro926. Some of the amino acid residues in close proximity to the active site show weaker signals compared to other amino acid residues of the protein, suggesting that the active site shows slow conformational exchange. For some of the resonances even two separate signals can be detected. These resonances include the active site Asp875 and several residues directly N-terminal to the active site as well as the Mg2+ coordinating Asp831. Additional double resonances

To investigate which of both domains is responsible for the interaction with the RcsD-HPt domain, we repeated the titration experiment, this time, however, with the isolated RcsC-ABL domain. This titration experiment demonstrated that most of the chemical shift changes observed in the RcsD-HPt domain are due to interaction with the RcsC-PR domain. Only a small number of weak chemical shift changes were induced by the isolated RcsC-ABL domain. Interestingly, all of these chemical shift changes were located in helix I which forms a capping helix on top of the four helix bundle of the RcsD-HPt domain and the N terminus of helix IIA and the C terminus of

are seen for several residues of -helices 3 and 4 and of the connecting loops. The weak signal intensity of these additional peaks, however, has so far prevented a detailed structural analysis. Their appearance in the vicinity of Pro879, Pro898 and Pro926 suggests that they are most likely due to cis-trans proline isomerizations. Interaction of the RcsC-ABL and RcsC-PR domains with the RcsD-HPt domain and ­ investigation of the Mg2+-dependent BeF3 activation of the RcsC-PR domain Signal transduction within the Rcs pathway requires the transfer of a phosphoryl group from the RcsC-PR domain to the HPt domain of RcsD (formerly known as YojN). In a previous study we had investigated the interaction between both domains by NMR titration experiments. In these experiments we had followed the chemical shift changes of the 15N-labeled RcsD-HPt domain upon

74 helix III, which are in close proximity to helix I. The reverse titration of the 15N-labeled RcsC-ABL domain with the unlabeled RcsD-HPt domain confirmed the existence of a direct but weak interaction based on the detection of only small chemical shift differences. These differences are located mostly in the loop connecting strand 5 with the last helix 2. Additional very small chemical shift differences also occur in the structurally adjacent N-terminus of loop L3 (Figure 6(a) and Supplementary Data, Figure 1). Comparison of the interaction surface of the RcsD-HPt domain with the RcsC-ABL domain and with the full length RcsC700-949 protein suggests that it is the RcsC-PR domain that interacts with the active site His842 as well as the adjacent surface, including the C-terminal half of helix III and the N terminus of helix IIB. Titration experiments with the 15 N-labeled RcsC-PR and the unlabeled RcsD-HPt domains revealed that the most significant chemical shift differences appear

for residues in the loop connecting strand 1 with helix 1, the N terminus of helix 1, the C terminus of strand 4 and the adjacent loop (Figure 6(b) and Supplementary Data, Figure 2). Interestingly, the active site Asp 875 is not affected by the titration with the RcsD-HPt domain and of the Mg2+-coordinating motif, only Asp832 exhibits small chemical shift changes. To investigate if Mg ions interact with either of these domains we titrated a solution of RcsC700-949 with a MgCl2 solution. This titration revealed chemical shift changes exclusively in the RcsC-PR domain, suggesting that only this domain and not the RcsC-ABL domain binds Mg2+ specifically (Figure 7 and Supplementary Data, Figure 3). This result is consistent with the fact that the Mg2+ binding signature sequence Asp-Asp present in the RcsC-PR domain is replaced with a Arg-Asn sequence in the RcsC-ABL domain. Within the RcsC-PR domain, the strongest chemical shift differences are observed for the end of strand 1

75 interaction networks rely on phosphorylation cascades including many kinases. In contrast, phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction in prokaryotic cells is based on relatively simple twocomponent systems that involve one membrane bound and sensor coupled histidine kinase and an effector protein, for example a transcription factor that becomes phosphorylated.33­35 However, in addition to these simple two-component systems prokaryotic cells have evolved also more complicated hybrid sensor kinase systems, characterized by the integration of PR and HPt domains. From HPt domains the phosphoryl group is transferred to the phosphoaccepting receiver domain of an effector protein. 36,37 In the Rcs system an even more complicated phosphotransfer scheme has evolved that relies on the intermolecular phosphoryl transfer between the two hybrid sensor kinases RcsC and RcsD. The discovery of yet another domain in the RcsC protein, the RcsC-ABL domain seems to further complicate this system. However, despite its structural similarity to phosphoreceiver domains no interaction with Mg2+ or beryllium fluoride could be detected although the RcsC-ABL domain contains a conserved aspartate residue (Asp750) in a location that corresponds to the active site Asp875 in the RcsC-PR domain. All other critical residues involved in phosphotransfer in the RcsC-PR domain including the Asp-Asp di-peptide are however, substituted with other amino acid types. The conclusion that the RcsC-ABL domain is not directly involved in the transfer of the phosphoryl group is further supported by mapping of the interaction surfaces between all domains involved. These titration experiments have revealed that the RcsC-PR domain contacts the RcsD-HPt region near the active site including His842. However, these experiments had also demonstrated a direct interaction between the RcsC-ABL and the RcsDHPt domains involving the capping helix I. In contrast to the interaction with the RcsC-ABL domain the interaction of the RcsD-HPt domain with the RcsC-PR domain seems to be dependent on the phosphorylation state of the domain. A weak interaction between both domains exists in the non-phosphorylated state (our previous work23 and this study, Supplementary Data, Figure 4). Surprisingly, this interaction does not include the active site aspartate and of the two critical Asp residues that coordinate the Mg2+ only one shows small chemical shift differences during the titration experiments, suggesting that the RcsC-PR domain has to undergo a conformational change in order to form a productive complex with the RcsD-HPt domain. Indeed a change in conformation and dynamics in the helix 4 and in the loops surrounding the active site (so called "3445" face) ­ can be observed upon addition of Mg2+ and BeF3 38­42 similar to other phospho-receiver domains. Although the ABL domain does not appear to play a direct role in the phosphoryl transfer it is present in all RcsC sequences of all enterobacteria sequenced so far. The low sequence identity among

containing the Mg2+-coordinating Asp-Asp di-peptide motif, the following loop and the adjacent N terminus of helix 1, the C terminus of strand 3 including the phosphoaccepting aspartate and the adjacent loop as well as the loop between strand 4 and helix 4. In a subsequent experiment we titrated unlabeled RcsD-HPt domain into a solution of the 15 N-labeled RcsC700-949 pre-loaded with Mg2+. Similar to the previous titration without Mg2+, we could detect only a small number of small chemical shift differences that involved the same regions that were identified in the previous experiments. This result suggests that Mg2+ alone is not sufficient to induce a strong interaction between the RcsD-HPt domain and RcsC700-949. To test if the interaction is influenced by phosphorylation we added beryllium fluoride as a phosphorylation mimetic 31,32 to a solution of RcsC700-949 pre-loaded with Mg2+. Significant chemical shift differences occurred in the spectrum, with some peaks shifting and some disappearing. The resonance overlap in the spectra, however, prevented a detailed analysis of the effect of adding ­ BeF3 on both domains. In order to solve the overlap problem, we expressed RcsC 700-949 selectively labeled with [15N]Asp and repeated the experiments with this sample. In agreement with the experiments described above addition of Mg 2+ resulted in chemical shift differences of aspartates located only in the RcsC-PR domain (Figure 7(c)). The Mg2+ coordinating Asp831 and Asp832 as well as the active site Asp875 resonances disappeared, while others in close structural proximity (Asp856, Asp859 and Asp920) shifted. Even more prominent differ­ ences occur after addition of BeF3 to the sample. Interestingly, the resonances of the active site and Mg2+-coordinating aspartate residues as well as of an aspartate residue in the loop connecting strand 3 with helix 3 that was invisible even in the Mg2+free state reappear, indicating the loss of internal dynamics. Additional differences accumulated upon titration with the RcsD-HPt domain. Interestingly, all significant chemical shift differences were located in the RcsC-PR domain with the RcsC-ABL domain only showing the small chemical shift differences also seen in the previous titration experiments. These results suggest that the interaction between the RcsD-HPt domain and the RcsC-ABL domain is weak and independent of the phosphorylation state of the neighboring RcsC-PR domain. Based on the number and value of the chemical shift differences observed in the RcsC-PR domain the interaction with the RcsD-HPt domain becomes significantly stronger upon addition of Mg2+ and ­ BeF3 .

Discussion
Phosphorylation-based signal transduction in eukaryotic cells often involves complicated protein­protein interaction networks. Many of these

76 these different ABL domains that is in stark contrast to the high sequence conservation of the flanking HK and PR domains suggests that the ABL domain most likely plays a structural role. Based on this interpretation several options for the function of the RcsC-ABL domain can in principle be envisaged. (I) Despite the absence of the Mg2+ coordination motif, an active role in phosphotransfer cannot be completely excluded. The position of Asp750 corresponds to the location of the active site phosphoaccepting aspartate in PR domains. Interestingly, this aspartate is conserved among all eight putative ABL domains in RcsC sequences (Figure 4). A complete active site could be reconstituted by interaction with other proteins or domains. (II) RcsC-ABL could act as a coordination module that facilitates the phosphoryl transfer between the RcsC-HK and the RcsC-PR domains or the RcsC-PR and the RcsD-HPt domain. (III) Finally, the RcsC-ABL domain could act as an inter-molecular binding site for additional proteins that either modulate the phosphotransfer in the Rcs pathway or facilitate cross-talk with other phosphorelay systems. In this respect it is interesting to note that structural investigations of PR domains have revealed that they frequently form dimers, often involving those helices that are replaced by loops in the RcsC-ABL domain.43,44 Since the phosphoaccepting function of ABL domains might have been lost during evolution, the original dimerization function might have evolved into a function that regulates the interaction with other proteins. The interpretation that ABL or ABL-like domains might be important for signal transduction in bacteria is further supported by the fact that similar sized but so far uncharacterised domains occur in several hundred kinase-like sequences. This first description of an ABL domain thus further contributes to the increased complexity of prokaryotic signaling systems.

Solution Structure of the E. coli RcsC C Terminus RcsC-PR was expressed as a fusion protein, containing 18 residues of RcsC-ABL at the N terminus followed by a Arg-Gly di-peptide. Protein expression, purification and NMR samples preparation For protein expression the corresponding plasmids were transformed into the E. coli M15/pREP4 strain. Expression of uniformly 13C and/or 15N-labeled proteins was achieved by growing the bacteria on minimal medium containing 1 g/l 15NH4Cl, and 2.0 g/l unlabeled/ D- [U-13C]-glucose and 1.0 g/l unlabelled/[U-13C]glycerol. The protein's overproduction was induced by 1.0 mM IPTG. After 3 h of induction, the cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM Tris­ HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol (pH 7.5) and lysed. The proteins were loaded onto a Ni2+- Chelate Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham-PharmaciaBiotech) column and eluted with a linear gradient from 20 mM­500 mM imidazole. Further purification and buffer exchange into NMR buffer (35 mM Tris­HCl, 125 mM NaCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM -Met, 2.0 mM TCEP) was achieved by gelfiltration with a Superdex200 column. Pure sample fractions were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of 0.2­1.1 mM. A 5% 2H2O as lock substance and 0.1 mM 4.4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1sulfonate (DSS) as internal proton chemical shift standard were added to the samples. NMR spectroscopy Assignment of RcsC700-949 resonances has been described elsewhere46 and mostly followed standard structure determination procedures. Proton­proton distances for structure calculations were derived from spectra collected at 296 K on Bruker Avance700 and DRX600 spectrometers equipped with cryogenic probes with Z-gradient capability. Proton chemical shifts were referenced relative to internal DSS. The 15N and 13C chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using the consensus N ratios.47 A TROSY-based48 15N-edited 3D NOESY with a mixing time of 70 ms was collected for the RcsC700-949, RcsC-ABL and RcsC-PR samples. 13 C-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra (mixing times 80 ms) were recorded in two different versions, optimized for H/H NOE-correlations (3D NOESY[1H,13C]-HSQC) using gradient-coherence selection49 and for methyl group NOE-correlations (3D NOESY-(CT)[1H,13C]-HSQC) using WATERGATE solvent suppression.50 A 13C-edited 3D NOESY spectrum employing a constant time 13 C TROSY evolution period51 was recorded in order to derive distance constraints involving aromatic ring protons. The mixing time chosen for this spectrum was set to 120 ms. Prior to Fourier transformation, all the time-domain data were zero-filled and multiplied by a 90°­shifted squared sine-bell window function in all dimensions. The proton-exchange experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance700 spectrometer at 296 K. The 15N-labeled RcsC700-949 sample was exchanged in 2H2O-based buffer on a 16x10 PE10 desalting column so that the time between sample injection and end of first [1H,15N]-HSQC spectrum did not exceed 120 min. Spectra were acquired every 30 min during the first 2 h and thereafter every 2 h the following day.

Methods
Strains, plasmids and DNA manipulations All cloning steps were performed following standard protocols.45 Polymerase chain reactions were carried out using Vent polymerase (NewEnglandBiolabs). The cloning of an expressible gene encoding amino acids 700 to 949 of the RcsC protein and containing the complete receiver domain was described elsewhere.23 The DNA fragment encoding amino acids 700­816 of the RcsC protein (RcsC-ABL domain) was amplified by using the oligonucleotides RcsCR-up (CGGGATCCGG-CGTGGAAGGGTTGAGTGGTAAACG) and RcsCNPR-low (CGGAAGCTTTTAATG-GTGATGGTGATGGTGGTCCGTTGACGGCAGAGCGTTAGC) as primers and chromosomal DNA of the E. coli strain XL1 (Stratagene) as a template. The DNA fragment was cloned with the restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII into the expression vector pQE60 (Qiagen) resulting in the plasmid pQE60-RcsC-ABL including a C-terminal poly(His)6-tag.

Solution Structure of the E. coli RcsC C Terminus The NMR spectra were processed and analysed using the XWINNMR 2.6 and AURELIA 2.7.5 (Bruker BioSpin) and Sparky 3.11152 programs. Structure calculation The NOE-based distance restraints for the RcsC700-949 were extracted from the 3D 13C and 15N-edited NOESY spectra using the CANDID module of the CYANA24 program, version 1.0.5. The final structure calculation was performed using a simulated annealing protocol with torsion angle dynamics (DYANA27 1.5) on the basis of 3415 unambiguous upper limit constraints generated by CANDID. One hundred and one hydrogen bonds, deduced from the proton exchange data and secondary structure prediction, were included as distance restraints (dHO  2.1 Å and dNO  3.1 Å). In addition, 276 torsion angle constraints were included as predicted by the program TALOS26 based on chemical shift values. Two hundred and twenty stereo-specific assignments were obtained for the prochiral methylene protons and isopropyl groups of 65 residues using the program GLOMSA.53 For the calculation of the final structure ensemble, 200 structures were calculated in 8000 time steps per conformer. The 40 best DYANA conformers were refined in an explicit water shell28 using the CNS software package54 and 20 structures with the lowest energy (about -11000 kcal/mol) were selected for validation using PROCHECK-NMR55 3.4. The Figures were prepared using the programs MOLMOL56 and PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC). Structure calculation of the RcsC-ABL and RcsC-PR domains followed the protocol described above. Protein-protein interaction The chemical shift perturbation values, , were calculated for each individual amide group using the formula:57 Dy ¼ ½Dy2 þ ðDyN =6:5Þ2 1=2 HN The dissociation constants, Kd, were calculated by a least-squares fit to the titration data under the assumptions of a fast exchange regime and a "one binding site" mode of protein interaction. The equations for the Kd calculations have been described.58,59 Kd and max = bound-free were used as minimization parameters. Protein Data Bank accession codes The atomic coordinates and the structure factors of the whole E. coli RcsC700-949 (PDB ID code is 2AYX), RcsC-ABL domain (PDB ID code is 2AYY) and RcsC-PR domain (PDB ID code is 2AYZ) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.
