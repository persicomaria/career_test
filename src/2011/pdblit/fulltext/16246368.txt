The response regulator DosR is essential for promoting long-term survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis under low oxygen conditions in a dormant state and may be responsible for latent tuberculosis in one-third of the world's population. Here, we report crystal structures of full-length unphosphorylated DosR at 2.2 Å resolution and its C-terminal DNAbinding domain at 1.7 Å resolution. The full-length DosR structure reveals several features never seen before in other response regulators. The Nterminal domain of the full-length DosR structure has an unexpected ()4 topology instead of the canonical ()5 fold observed in other response regulators. The linker region adopts a unique conformation that contains two helices forming a four-helix bundle with two helices from another subunit, resulting in dimer formation. The C-terminal domain in the fulllength DosR structure displays a novel location of helix 10, which allows Gln199 to interact with the catalytic Asp54 residue of the N-terminal domain. In contrast, the structure of the DosR C-terminal domain alone displays a remarkable unstructured conformation for helix 10 residues, different from the well-defined helical conformations in all other known structures, indicating considerable flexibility within the C-terminal domain. Our structures suggest a mode of DosR activation by phosphorylation via a helix rearrangement mechanism.

Latent tuberculosis is a major public health concern because it acts as a reservoir of M. tuberculosis that can remain undetected for decades before re-emerging as active disease. Current treatments for tuberculosis are highly effective only when the bacteria are actively growing. Tuberculosis infections require prolonged drug therapy, presumably due to the persistence of the bacteria that make them refractory to the drug treatment. Two-component regulatory systems in bacteria are a major class of signal transduction proteins

228 involved in adaptation to environmental changes.3 Typical two-component regulatory systems contain (i) a membrane-bound sensor kinase that has a crucial role in sensing environmental stimuli, and (ii) a cytosolic response regulator, usually consisting of an N-terminal domain, a linker, and a Cterminal domain. This pair of proteins functions as a molecular switch that controls diverse adaptive environmental responses.3­5 In the presence of the appropriate stimulus, a sensor kinase catalyzes an ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of a specific

His residue in the cytoplasmic domain. The signaling cascade proceeds next by transfer of the phosphoryl group from the histidine of the sensor kinase to a conserved aspartate in the N-terminal domain of the response regulator. Phosphorylation of the response regulator switches on its C-terminal domain to perform its associated function such as DNA-binding or enzymatic activity. Multi-domain response regulators containing a C-terminal DNAbinding domain function in most cases as transcription factors by binding to promoter regions of

Our previous crystal structures of the DosR Cterminal domain (DosRC) and of its complex with DNA identify DosR as a member of the NarL subfamily of response regulators on the basis of the structural topology of the C-terminal domain.55 A DosRC dimer is the functional unit for DNA binding where residues in the C-terminal helix 10 form a dimerization interface.55 Two such DNA-binding dimers assemble as a tetramer via an interface involving helices 7 and 8 of the C-terminal domain.55 However, due to the absence of the Nterminal regulatory domain, a molecular mechanism for phosphorylation activation of DosR remains unclear. Here, we report a crystal structure of fulllength unphosphorylated DosR at 2.2 Å resolution. Our structure reveals a novel topology for both the N-terminal domain and the linker region, and a unique conformation for the C-terminal domain. In addition, we present a 1.7 Å resolution structure of the C-terminal domain fragment (DosRC) with yet another conformation of the residues forming helix 10, which is different from our previous structures of DosRC55 and, to the best of our knowledge, all related structures.6,11,12,56­62 The structures reported here provide insight on how DosR conformational changes might be induced by phosphorylation through a helix rearrangement mechanism.

specific genes to activate gene expression. This family of response regulators can be classified into three major subfamilies, NarL, 6 OmpR,7,8 and NtrC,9,10 on the basis of their C-terminal domain sequences.3­5 So far, unphosphorylated full-length structures have been reported only for the NarL (represented by NarL6,11 and StyR12) and OmpR (represented by DrrD13 and DrrB14) subfamilies. No full-length structure of a multi-domain response regulator in the active phosphorylated state has been reported to date. A two-component regulatory system dosS-dosR (also called devS-devR15) is among the M. tuberculosis genes induced by hypoxia or NO exposure,16,17 two conditions frequently associated with the onset and maintenance of latent tuberculosis.18,19 Sherman et al.16 proposed that dosS and dosR form a two-component signaling system involved in the adaptation of bacilli to low oxygen conditions within the host. Nearly all M. tuberculosis genes rapidly up-regulated in response to low oxygen and NO levels require DosR for their induction.17,20 The sensor kinase DosS (whose gene is upstream of the dosR gene) and an orphan sensor kinase DosT (located elsewhere) phosphorylate their conserved histidine (His395 for DosS and His392 for DosT) and subsequently transfer the phosphoryl group to Asp54 of DosR using Mg2+ as a cofactor.21­23 Phosphorylation of the catalytic Asp54 presumably leads to a conformational change that enhances the binding affinity of DosR to its cognate DNA sequence and activates transcription of regulated genes.21 By sequence homology, the N-terminal domain of DosR belongs to a larger CheY family of regulatory domains with a ()5 fold.24 The activation mechanism in this family of regulatory domains has been studied extensively through comparisons of available native and phosphorylation-activated regulatory domain structures of FixJ,25,26 NtrC,27,28 and Spo0A,29,30 and BeF3- activated structures of CheY,31­33 DctD,34,35 NtrC,28,36 Spo0F,37­40 CheY2,41 ArcA,42 PhoB43 and Ntrc1.9,44 Six conserved residues have been reported to be involved in the phosphorylation activation mechanism: three Asp (equivalent to Asp8, Asp9, and Asp54 in DosR), one Thr/Ser (Thr82), one Tyr/ Phe (Tyr101), and one Lys (Lys104)45 (for residue numbers of selected proteins, see Fig. 1). All these proteins share a general mechanism of "coupled rearrangement" of the Thr and Tyr residues after modification of the third Asp occurs (by a phosphoryl group or its analog BeF3 - ). 4,36,45 Upon activation, the Thr residue changes conformation to form a hydrogen bond with an oxygen atom of a phosphoaspartate (or a fluoride atom in the BeF3- activated proteins). This causes the Tyr residue to move from a solvent-exposed outward position to a buried inward position, which induces conformational changes of nearby residues. Different response regulators have different magnitudes of conformational change38 and the outcome is different from case to case. For example, a phosphorylation-induced conformational change (i) triggers domain separation in FixJ46 and NarL,47 (ii) causes

Results
Overall structure of full-length DosR The structure of full-length DosR was solved by the SeMet MAD technique and refined using native data to 2.2 Å resolution (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains two DosR molecules forming a dimer related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. The electron density is well defined for the first 210 residues, with C-terminal tail residues 211­217 being disordered (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain of DosR (formed by residues 1­97) is connected to the C-terminal domain (residues 150­210) by a two-helix linker (Fig. 2). Quite remarkably, the structure of each of these three elements is different from other members of the NarL subfamily to which DosR belongs. The N-terminal regulatory domain The N-terminal domain of DosR contains an /  fold with a ()4 arrangement and is topologically different from the canonical regulatory domain fold with a ()5 arrangement.24 The canonical secondary structure elements 4 and 5 appear to be absent from the DosR structure (Fig.

2). Surprisingly, the DosR helix 4 is positioned where the canonical helix 5 is located in structures of other members of the subfamily (as discussed below). The catalytic Asp54 residue, involved in the phosphorylation reaction, is located in the 3-3 loop surrounded by the conserved Asp8 and Asp9 residues from the 1-1 loop from the same subunit (Fig. 3). The O1 atom of Asp54 makes a hydrogen bond to a water molecule. This water molecule also forms two hydrogen bonds with the O1 and O2 atoms of Asp9. Interestingly, the O2 atom of Asp54 makes two hydrogen bonds to the O1 and N2 atoms of Gln199 located in the beginning of the Cterminal domain 10 helix. This unique feature will also be discussed further below. The linker region The linker formed by residues 98­149, between the N- and the C-terminal domains contains helices 5 (residues 101­121) and 6 (residues 127­143). These two helices form a four-helix bundle dimerization interface with their counterparts from another

subunit of the dimer (Fig. 2). According to a B-factor plot (not shown), helix 6 has the highest average Bfactor in the structure (78 Å2 for residues 125­144 versus 44 Å2 for the remainder of the protein), suggesting flexibility in this part of the molecule. The conserved Tyr101 and Lys104 residues of DosR are located at the beginning of helix 5 and their side chains point into the solvent. This arrangement is entirely different from what is seen in the structures of other NarL subfamily members.6,11,12 The C-terminal DNA-binding domain In the full-length DosR structure, the C-terminal domain folds back from the linker region to interact with the N-terminal domain of the same subunit (Fig. 2). This domain has an unusual conformation where helix 10, which starts at Gln199, moves away from the core formed by helices 7 to 9 of the C-terminal domain and packs against helix 1 of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2). The O1 and N2 atoms of Gln199 from helix 10 form hydrogen bonds to the O2 atom of Asp54 of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 3), shielding Asp54 and surrounding residues

from solvent and stabilizing the protein in the inactive closed conformation. Domain interfaces within a DosR subunit The interactions between the N-terminal domain, the linker region, and the C-terminal domain of DosR are extensive. The largest interdomain interface occurs between the N-terminal domain plus the linker region and the C-terminal domain, burying 2500 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area. This

interface has a gap volume index (gap volume per interface solvent-accessible surface) of 1.4 Å, which is a low value indicating an excellent complementarity of the interaction.63,64 The N-terminal domain alone and the C-terminal domain bury 1900 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area, with the same gap volume index. Interestingly, most of the interface between the N- and the C-terminal domains is due to contacts between the N-terminal domain and the 10 helix region (residues 194­210) which bury 1400 Å2 of solvent-accessible interface with a very

Y101 is 12 Å away from T82. The D54­Q199 and D87­E206 hydrogen bonds contribute to contacts between helix 10 and the N-terminal domain. The latter hydrogen bonds require protonation of at lease one of the carboxylates. (b) A stereo view of the phosphorylation site.

small gap volume index of 0.8 Å, indicating a very tight interaction, given that the average gap volume index is 2.5 ± 1.0 Å for heterocomplexes.64 The major contacts between the N-terminal domain and the 10 helix region are hydrogen bonds between Asp54 O2 and Gln199 O1 and N2 atoms; Leu81 carbonyl oxygen and Arg197 N and N2 atoms; Thr82 O1 and Met194 carbonyl oxygen; Thr82 carbonyl oxygen and Arg196 main chain N; Asp87 O1 and Arg197 N1; and Asp87 O2 and Glu206 O2 (Fig. 3). The rest of the C-terminal domain (helices 7­9) and the N-terminal domain bury only 500 Å2 of solvent accessible interface with a gap volume index of 4.9 Å, indicating weak interactions. Inspection of all hydrogen bonds present in all interdomain interfaces within the subunit reveals that only those between Asp54 O2 and Gln199 O1, and between Asp87 O2 and Glu206 O2 are made possible by protonation of side chain carboxylate

groups at pH 3.0 of our crystallization mother liquor. Only a small Gln199 side chain rotation is required, and possible, to maintain the Gln199-Asp54 contact via the N2 of Gln199 at neutral pH. Similarly, the loss of a proton in the Asp87­Glu206 hydrogen bond in our current structure might be followed by small rotations about the C­C bond of Asp87 and the C­C and C­C bonds of Glu206 so that these residues are not repulsed by the negative charges on the side chain carboxylate groups at neutral pH. Therefore, it is likely that at neutral pH, the 10 helix can also adopt the conformation observed in our structure. Because no contact involving protonated carboxylate groups occurs elsewhere within the same subunit, we believe that our structure may be physiologically relevant and crystallization conditions at low pH only helped stabilize the dynamically flexible helix 10 into a well-defined conformation that assists crystal growth.

233 and 9, superimpose well in all four available structures (DosRC-I, DosRC-DNA, DosRC-II, and full-length DosR) with mutual r.m.s. deviations of less than 1 Å (Fig. 5). However, the behavior of helix 10 is totally different. In the current fulllength structure, helix 10 starts at Gln199 (instead of Arg196 in the previous structures) and rotates about 113° from the canonical conformation to a new position, enabling the helix to interact with the N-terminal domain. In the new DosR C -II structure, residues Arg196­Gln199 become a coiled-coil structure, and residues after Gln199 are disordered. It is possible that residues Gln199­ Arg209 may still adopt a helical conformation in the DosRC-II crystal but, due to the high level of flexibility, this region is invisible in the electron density map. The orientation of this coiled-coil structure is accompanied by a 180° kink at Gly193 compared to the DosRC-I and the DNA complex structures (Fig. 5). The three different conformations of the residues forming helix 10 in different crystal structures suggest major flexibility within the C-terminal domain. This flexibility is most likely of great importance for DosR function, as discussed below. Comparison with homologous structures DosR is recognized as a member of the NarL subfamily by sequence homology of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). Two other members of this subfamily with known full-length structures are NarL6,11 and StyR,12 both in the unphosphorylated state. The N-terminal domain Full-length DosR adopts an unusual ()4 fold with the canonical helix 4 and strand 5 absent from the N-terminal domain compared to the ()5 fold of homologous structures. Superposition of the DosR N-terminal domain to its closest sequence homologue NarL11 yields an r.m.s. deviation of 1.7 Å for 82 superimposable C atoms, and 1.2 Å for the superposition of 77 C atoms with StyR (Fig. 6). Their equivalent secondary structure elements comprise 1­3 plus 5 in NarL and StyR and 1­3 plus 4 in DosR. Most unexpectedly, helix 4 of DosR is shifted and positioned in a place where the canonical helix 5 is located in NarL and StyR. In another surprise, a sequence segment Tyr101­ Gly121 of DosR, corresponding to 5­5 of the canonical regulatory domain becomes helix 5 of the linker region. When considering conserved residues involved in phosphorylation activation, it appears that Asp8 and Asp9 in the 1-1 loop, and Asp54 in the 3-3 loop, are within 1 Å from equivalent residues in other structures. However, the key Thr82 residue located at the end of strand 4 is shifted 3­4 Å away compared to the position of the equivalent Thr residue in other structures, as the 4­4 loop has to connect to helix 4 in its new position (Fig. 6b and c). Tyr101, conserved in

Dimer interface of full-length DosR The two subunits in the asymmetric unit form a dimer related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 2b). The dimerization interface buries 2900 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area, of which 33% is polar and its gap volume index is 2.4 Å (compared to an average of 2.2 ± 0.9 Å for homodimers).64 The two-helix linker (helices 5 and 6) from both subunits form a four-helix bundle and bury 1800 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area; i.e., 62% of the total dimerization interface. The second part of the dimerization interface comes from interactions between the N-terminal domain helices 2 and 3 of one subunit and the C-terminal domain helices 7 and 8 of the other subunit. A sulfate molecule is found buried in the dimer interface mediating hydrogen bonds between its oxygen atoms and side chains of Arg113, and of a protonated Asp117, and mediating longer-range electrostatic interactions with the guanidinium group of Arg67 at a distance of 3.6 Å. Structure of the DosR C-terminal domain in crystal form II The DosRC structure in a new crystal form II (DosR C -II), different from our crystal form I (DosRC-I),55 was obtained at pH 6.5, solved by molecular replacement and refined to 1.7 Å resolution (Table 1). Interestingly, molecular replacement using all four helices of the DosRC-I structure was not successful, but using only helices 7­9 gave a clear solution. In the DosRC-II crystals, two DosRC molecules form a dimer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 4a). The dimerization interface buries 1300 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area with a gap volume index of 2.7 Å. In this structure, helices 7, 8, and 9 are arranged in the manner as observed previously in the structures of the DosRC-I and DosRC-DNA complexes55 (Fig. 4b) and in the full-length structure reported here (Fig. 2). Most surprisingly, however, helix 10 was not observed in this structure with residues Arg196 to Gln199 adopting a coiled-coil structure and residues beyond Gln199 being disordered. The latter probably explains the differences in success with three- and four-helix molecular replacement probes. Comparison of the DosR C-terminal domain structures The full-length DosR and the new DosRC-II structures presented here reveal two novel features, with helix 10 separated from the rest of the C-terminal domain in both cases. In our previous structures of DosRC-I55 and the DosRC-DNA complex,55 helix 10 is formed by residues Arg196 to Arg209 and packs in the canonical conformation against the hydrophobic core of the rest of the domain (7­9 helices). In the two new structures described here, residues Leu150­Leu192, comprising helices 7, 8,

conserved Lys104, which makes a salt-bridge with a phosphoryl oxygen of phosphoaspartate or BeF3 ­ analog in activated response regulator structures, is located in the 5 linker helix in our structure 21 Å away from the position of the equivalent Lys in NarL and StyR. This has implications for the activation mechanism as will be discussed below. The linker region The interdomain linker of the full-length DosR structure shows no resemblance to those of NarL and StyR.6,11,12 Quite surprisingly, DosR uses the amino acid sequence for the canonical 5­5 secondary structure elements to form a "new" helix 5 (Figs. 1 and 2), which clearly is part of the linker connecting the N-terminal and the Cterminal domains. Together with helix 6, the twohelix linker forms a four-helix bundle with the other subunit in the dimer (Fig. 2). In contrast, in the unphosphorylated NarL structure, helix 6 is a linker allowing both domains to make contacts in a compact "closed" conformation (Fig. 6a).6,11 In the case of StyR, the 5 helix adopts its canonical position but residues 108­141 form a long helical extension of helix 5 that separates the C-terminal domain from the N-terminal domain by 48 Å (blue helical segment in Fig. 6a).12 (Although specific residues involved in activation adopt an "activelike" conformation, the reported structure of StyR is likely to be an inactive monomer from an oligomerization point of view).12 In the case of DosR, however, the linker positions the C-terminal domain near the phosphorylation site to make extensive

contacts with the N-terminal domain. Moreover, the DosR linker provides a dimerization interface for the unphosphorylated protein in contrast to both StyR and NarL, whose structures are both monomeric (Figs. 2 and 6a).6,11,12 The C-terminal domain Except for helix 10, the C-terminal domain in the full-length DosR and the DosRC-II structures are similar to the canonical conformation observed in all related structures.6,11,12,55­62 In contrast, the entire C-terminal domains of the full-length NarL and StyR structures are both in the canonical conformation (Fig. 6a).6,11,12 In all three full-length proteins, the C-terminal domain does not form the 10 interface dimer as seen in the previous structure of DosRC-I and its DNA complex55 and the NarLCDNA complex.59

Discussion
How phosphorylation activates response regulators is one of the central questions in two-component regulatory system research. Response regulators are believed to be in equilibrium between inactive and active conformations, with phosphorylation acting as a molecular switch to shift this equilibrium towards the active form.45,65­67 In all activated structures of the N-terminal regulatory domain, phosphorylation (or BeF3 activation) of the critical Asp residue causes a movement of a conserved Lys in the 5­5 loop to form a salt-bridge to the phosphoryl group. Phosphorylation also causes a conforma-

tional change of a conserved Thr residue in strand 4 to form a hydrogen bond with a phosphoryl oxygen atom. This allows the side chain of a conserved Tyr residue in 5 to reorient from a solvent-exposed outward position to fill a pocket vacated by the Thr residue in a buried inward position with concomitant conformational changes of surrounding residues.45

The puzzle remaining after our structure determination is that, in DosR, Tyr101 and Lys104 (i) deviate considerably from the positions seen in other structures; (ii) the side chains in their new positions are essentially totally solvent-exposed, while (iii) these residues are conserved nevertheless. The main reason for all these differences is a major rearrangement of secondary structure elements such that

It is likely that at neutral pH, helix 10 is dynamically in equilibrium between different conformations, of which at least two are seen in our structures reported here. This would allow Asp54 to be solvent-exposed part of the time and to become phosphorylated in the presence of sensor His kinases or acetyl phosphate. A proposed helix rearrangement activation mechanism On the basis of the structures reported here and previously,55 we propose that the arrangement of helices 4, 5, and 10 from the conformations seen

our full-length DosR structure lacks the canonical 4 and 5 secondary structure elements in the N-terminal domain in which the conserved Tyr101 and Lys104 are located. These residues are now found in helix 5 of the linker region 15­20 Å away from the catalytic Asp54. The DosR activation mechanism may involve a phosphorylation-dependent equilibrium switching between the inactive conformation seen in our fulllength structure and the active canonical conformation where the C-terminal domain forms a dimer at the 10 interface.55 Our full-length DosR structure indicates that in the inactive conformation, the Cterminal domain is bound to the N-terminal domain where Gln199 of helix 10 may make contacts with and buries Asp54 residues from accessibility to solvent. Interestingly, a similar interaction has been observed for Spo0F where the catalytic Asp54 residue is blocked by a salt-bridge interaction of an Arg

Fig. 7. A helix rearrangement activation mechanism of DosR by phosphorylation. The N-terminal regulatory domain is shown in magenta, the linker in blue, and the C-terminal DNA-binding domain in green. Helices are numbered. The critical Asp54 is depicted as a red star with a yellow core. Unphosphorylated DosR dimer in an inactive/closed conformation (1), as seen in the crystal structure of full-length DosR, and is in a concentration-dependent equilibrium with monomer (2) in solution. At neutral pH, helix 10 adopts multiple conformations, including one with no contact with the N-terminal domain (3), allowing Asp54 to be solvent-exposed. One of these conformations might be the "canonical" conformation, which may facilitate phosphorylation of Asp54 and in its turn may contribute to shifting the equilibrium towards that of the canonical conformation. The linker helix 5 becomes now the canonical 5 and 5 secondary structure elements (4), resulting in an active/open conformation with the two domains separated by linker 6 (5). This allows the C-terminal domain to arrange helix 10 to its canonical position and interact with 10 from a second subunit to form the 10 helix interface, resulting in a DosR dimer (6). This dimer recognizes cognate DNA yielding a DosR dimer­DNA complex (7).

238 in our structure to new conformations in a phosphorylated active state occurs via a helix rearrangement mechanism (Fig. 7). The unphosphorylated DosR dimer in an inactive/closed conformation (1 in Fig. 7) as seen in the crystal structure of full-length DosR, is in equilibrium with the monomer (2) in solution. At neutral pH, helix 10 adopts multiple conformations, including one with no contact with the N-terminal domain (3), allowing Asp54 to be solvent-exposed part of the time. Phosphorylation of Asp54 is likely to promote a cascade of events that may be as follows. First, the new phosphoryl group will prevent helix 10 from returning to bind the N-terminal domain due to steric hindrance between the phosphoaspartate and Gln199 side chains. Secondly, phosphorylation presumably induces a conformational change in the N-terminal domain such that interactions with the C-terminal domain (as seen in our structure) become unfavorable. This change includes a rearrangement of the ()4 domain and of the 5-6 linker seen in our structure to become the canonical ()5 fold. In this case, helix 4 moves to resume its canonical position and helix 5 becomes the canonical 5-5 unit. Such a conformational change will cause a collision between helix 4 and the C-terminal domain. Thirdly, the conserved Thr82 side chain may abandon its interactions with the C-terminal domain (i.e. with residues Met194 and Arg196) in order to reorient and form a hydrogen bond with phosphoaspartate. Alternatively, the adoption of the canonical ()5 fold could potentially take place before phosphorylation of Asp54 occurs. In agreement with the fact that the interdomain interface in our structure occurs extensively only through the helix 10 region, while the rest of the interface is minimal, a separation of the two domains after phosphorylation of the Nterminal domain is likely to occur (4). This allows the C-terminal domain to arrange helix 10 to its canonical position, leading to an active/open conformation (5) and form a dimer using the 10 helix interface (6), resulting in a DosR dimer-DNA complex in the presence of cognate DNA (7). In the absence of a phosphorylated DosR structure, this scenario remains to be validated. Nevertheless, once the C-terminal domain is released from the N-terminal domain and the 10 helix is reorganized to the canonical conformation, DosR becomes active and binds to DNA21 as a dimer, as observed in the structures of the DosRC-DNA complex.55

were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 20 min at 4 °C and stored at -80 °C. Cell pellets containing SeMet DosR were resuspended in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), benzonase nuclease, and lysed by sonication. Protamine sulfate was added to the lysate and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, then centrifuged at 20,000g for 30 min and the supernatant was clarified by filtration and loaded onto a Ni-NTA affinity chromatography column. The non-specifically bound proteins were eluted with 30 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol. Subsequently, SeMet DosR was eluted with 300 mM imidazole in the same buffer. Fractions containing SeMet DosR were concentrated and subsequently purified using a Superdex75 HR10/30 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A (20 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine). SeMet DosR from peak fractions was diluted to 3 mg/ml in the same buffer for crystallization. Native DosR was expressed in LB medium and purified by the same procedure as that used for the SeMet protein. Crystallization SeMet DosR crystals were grown at 4° C by the sittingdrop, vapor diffusion method; 2 l of 10% glycerol, 1 l of 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 l of precipitant containing 0.5 M Li2SO4 and 0.1 M citric acid (pH 3.0) were added to 2 l of protein (3 mg/ml) to minimize showers of microcrystals. Thin plate crystals appeared after a week and reached their maximum size after about a month. For acetyl phosphate-soaking experiments, crystals were transferred from the mother liquor to a working solution containing 25 mM lithium potassium acetyl phosphate and 5 mM MgCl2 in a mixture of 1:1:1 ratio by volume of buffer A:50% glycerol: precipitant and were soaked in this solution at 4 °C for 1 h. Crystals were subsequently transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 25 mM lithium potassium acetyl phosphate and 5 mM MgCl2 in a mixture of 1:1:1 ratio of buffer A:75% glycerol:precipitant and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Native DosR was crystallized at 4° C by the sitting-drop, vapor-diffusion method; 2 l of 10% glycerol, 1 l of 10 mM MnCl2, and 1 l of precipitant solution containing 0.5 M lithium sulfate and 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.0 were added to 2 l of protein solution. Crystals were soaked for 10 s in a solution containing 5 mM MnCl2 in 1:1:1 ratio by volume of buffer A:50% glycerol:precipitant followed by a cryoprotectant solution containing 5 mM MnCl2 in 1:1:1 ratio by volume of buffer A:75% glycerol:precipitant, and subsequently flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Native DosRC was expressed and purified as described for SeMet DosRC.55 The protein was crystallized with 24% (w/v) PEG 5000 MME, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol and 0.1 M MES buffer pH 6.5. Crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing the same concentration of precipitant plus additional 15% ethylene glycol and subsequently flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data collection and structure determination DosR crystals often diffracted anisotropically and had very high mosaicity (2­2.5°) unsuitable for data collection. Hundreds of crystals had to be screened for diffraction quality. Data sets were eventually collected from a native

refinement, the SeMet DosR structure was almost identical with the native structure but, unfortunately, no electron density for a phosphorylated aspartate was observed. A data set for the native DosRC crystal form II was collected at the Advance Light Source (ALS). The data set was processed with HKL200069 in space group P212121, while the SeMet DosRC crystal form I, crystallized under similar conditions, belongs to space group P1.55 The structure could not be solved by molecular replacement using the complete C-terminal domain of crystal form I55 as search model. A new search model using only helices 7­9 was used and two solutions were found using the program MOLREP,76 resulting in subunits A and B per asymmetric unit. The A-weighted Fobs­Fcalc electron density map after several cycles of rigid body and restrained refinements using REFMAC78 revealed extra electron density for the C-terminal portion of the molecule in a conformation different from what had been observed previously.55 Automatic model building using RESOLVE_ BUILD script75 was carried out followed by manual building and water adding using the program COOT.77 Subsequently REFMAC78 was used for TLS refinement,79,80 yielding the statistics summarized in Table 1.

crystal to 2.2 Å resolution, and from an acetyl phosphatesoaked SeMet crystal. The SeMet data sets were collected at the Se peak and high-energy remote wavelengths at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and processed separately (due to random crystal orientations on a goniometer) with HKL200069 to 2.9 Å for the peak wavelength data and 4.1 Å for the remote wavelength data. The peak wavelength was used for finding Se sites and phasing. The systematic absence of the data suggested space group P212121. The Matthews' coefficient was 2.6 Da/Å3 for two molecules in the asymmetric unit (with an anticipated 16 SeMet/asymmetric unit). While the self-rotation function revealed no non-origin peak, the self-Patterson function contained one strong peak at v = 0.5, suggesting a noncrystallographic translation along the b axis which may contribute to the systematic absence of 0 k 0 reflections. Hence, space group P21212 was also tested. The programs SHELX70 and BnP (SnB)71 were used to locate heavy atoms, and heavy-atom sites were refined by SOLVE/ RESOLVE72 or SHARP.73,74 All programs were able to find probable solutions for both P212121 and P21212 space groups. However, heavy-atom sites in space group P212121 show a drop of peak height after 16 sites were found and maintained high site occupancy after refinement, while in P21212 the peak heights decreased gradually without a clear cut. The program RESOLVE72 was able to find the NCS operators from these sites only in space group P212121, which incorporated a translation of 0.5 along v in agreement with the self-Patterson. Anomalous Fouriers using phases from RESOLVE confirmed the presence of all 16 sites. However, the map at this point was not interpretable. Molecular replacement with known structures of the DosR C-terminal domain55 did not yield a solution either by using Fobs or the experimental phased map. Molecular replacements using homologous protein structures of the N-terminal domain did not yield any solution. The remote wavelength data set was then used to improve phasing power. The program SHELX70 was used to search for 16 Se sites, which were found and appeared to be identical with those found previously using only the peak data. By subsequently using (i) the program SHARP73,74 to refine Se sites and calculate phases;. (ii) RESOLVE72 for density modification with NCS averaging; (iii) the RESOLVE_BUILD script for iterative model building and refinement, RESOLVE75 was able to build 296 residues, of which 80 residues had side chains assigned (out of the expected 450 residues in the asymmetric unit) with: Rwork =Rfree ¼ 43:9=52:1% This initial model was used as a search model for molecular replacement to the native data set collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) and processed with HKL200069 in space group P21. The program MOLREP76 yielded a clear solution with an R-factor of 44.1% and a correlation coefficient of 60%. At this point, the native data were used for chain tracing. Cycles of RESOLVE_BUILD75 and manual building using program COOT77 and restrained refinement using the program REFMAC78 were done next. The refinement of the native DosR structure was completed with TLS refinement79,80 using REFMAC78 after subsequent cycles of manual building and water addition. Data collection and the refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Subsequently, the native DosR model was used for molecular replacement for the MAD data set to verify the accuracy of the chain trace using anomalous Fourier peaks of methionine residues in the MAD electron density map, and to determine whether Asp54 was phosphorylated.
