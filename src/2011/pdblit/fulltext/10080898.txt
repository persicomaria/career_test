Cloning and characterization of the cDNAs encoding Na + channel-specific toxins 1 and 2 of the scorpion Centruroides noxius Hoffmann. Toxicon 33, 1161-1170, 1995.--Using a cDNA library prepared from venomous glands of the Mexican scorpion Centruroides noxius Hoffmann the genes that encode toxins 1 and 2 were identified, cloned and sequenced. In view of the proposed mechanism for processing the mature peptides coded by these two genes, the corresponding peptide-toxins were sequenced de novo. Mass spectrometric and IH-NMR analyses of the C-terminal peptide produced by enzymatic digestion of both toxins indicated that the last residue is serine-amide. Sequence comparison revealed that these two genes have a similarity of 56% and 80% at the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively. Small corrections to the published primary structures were introduced: Cn toxin 1 has an extra serine residue at position 65 and the residue in position 60 is a proline, while the amino acids at positions 34 and 35 of Cn 2 are, respectively, tyrosine and glycine. Sequence comparison of toxins from the genus Centruroides suggests the presence of at least three classes of distinct peptides in these venoms.

INTRODUCTION

Scorpion venoms contain an assortment of low mol. wt peptides toxic to a variety of organisms, including humans (Miranda et aL, 1970; Possani, 1984; Zlotkin et al., 1978). Scorpion toxins have been considered valuable tools for the study of ion channels (Catterall, 1976). Two main families of distinct peptides have been described: (l)

long-chain polypeptides containing 6 ~ 7 0 amino acid residues, which affect Na + channels of excitable cells (Catterall, 1977; Couraud et al., 1982), and (2) short-chain peptides of 31-39 amino acid residues, blockers of K + channels of excitable cells (Carbone et al., 1982; Gimenez-Gallego et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1985; Possani et al., 1982; Strong et al., 1989). We have previously described the purification, characterization and complete primary structure of C. noxius toxin 1 (abbreviated Cnl), previously called component II-14 (Possani et al., 1985) and Centruroides noxius toxin 2 (abbreviated Cn2), previously called component II-9.2.2 (Zamudio et al., 1992), from C. noxius venom. This communication reports the nucleotide sequence of the c D N A s encoding these toxins. Because the peptides encoded by these c D N A s are modified during the maturation process at the N-terminal site (cleavage of signal peptide) and at the C-terminal part (amidation of a serine residue for both Cnl and Cn2), the amino acid sequence of the corresponding peptides was performed de novo. A couple of minor corrections to the published primary structure of Cnl and Cn2 are now consequently included. Comparative analysis conducted thereafter suggests the existence of three distinct families or groups of peptides in the venom of scorpions of the genus Centruroides.

MATERIALS A N D METHODS
Cloning and nucleotide sequencing Inserts of cDNA from clones C n g t I V and CngtV (Becerril et al., 1993) were amplified by PCR using lambda

gtll forward ( 5 ' - G G T G G C G A C G A C T C C T G G A G C C C G ) and reverse (5'-TTGACACCAGACCAACTGGTAATG) primers (New England Bio-Labs, Beverly, MA, U.S.A.). These primers hybridize with the flanking regions of the lambda gtl 1 E c o R I cloning site. The reactions were performed using a Perkin Elmer 9600 using 30 rounds of temperature cycling (92°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min and 7T'C for 2 min) followed by a final 15 min step at 72°C. These PCR products were purified from gel, labelled using [~32p]dCTP (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA, U.S.A.) by the random primer extension method (Dupont, kit NEP-103, Boston, MA, U.S.A.) following the instructions of the manufacturers. The labelled PCR products were used to screen the cDNA library. The construction of the venom gland cDNA library, the screening conditions and the sequencing of the desired inserts were performed as described elsewhere (Becerril et al., 1993). The lambda gt 11 forward and reverse and the M13-20 and M13 reverse oligo primers were used for sequencing.

Amino acid sequence determination

Toxins Cnl and Cn2 were purified as described by Possani et al. (1985) and Zamudio et al. (1992). For Cnl (Possani et al., 1985), an additional chromatographic step on HPLC using a C4 reverse-phase column was introduced. Peptide eluting at 37.33 min corresponded to pure component Cnl (data not shown). Both toxins were reduced and carboxymethylated (RC-Toxin) (Zamudio et al., 1992). RC-toxin Cnl was cleaved with protease Asp-N (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), while RC-toxin Cn2 was digested with protease V8 from Staphylococcus aureus (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). The resulting fragments were separated on HPLC by means of an analytical column (reverse-phase C I 8 from Vydac, Hysperia, CA, U.S.A.). The ProSequencer model 6400/6600 (MilliGen/BioSearch/Millipore Division, Burlington, MA, U.S.A.) was used to determine the corresponding sequences (Vazquez et al., 1993).

Mass spectrometry and I H - N M R spectroscopy

Mass spectrometry of the C-terminal fragments of both RC-toxin Cnl and Cn2 was obtained as earlier described (Vazquez et al., 1993), using both a 3-sector mass spectrometer from Sciex and a Hewlett Packard electrospray mass spectrometer. For the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (~H-NMR) experiments, freeze-dried native toxin Cn2 was dissolved in H20/D20, 9:1 (v/v). The peptide concentration was 1.5 mM, and the solution pH was adjusted at 3.5. The N M R spectra were run on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer at 303 K. Data were processed with the V N M R 4.3 (Varian Inc.) software. P. COSY (correlated spectroscopy; Marion and Bax, 1988), clean TOCSY (total correlated spectroscopy; Griesinger et al., 1988) and NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effects spectroscopy; Kumar et al., 1980) experiments were used for the identification of spin systems, as described recently (Lebreton et al., 1994).

Cloning and nucleotide sequencing The c D N A inserts CngtlV (probe to look for the c D N A encoding toxin C n l ) and CngtV
(probe to find the c D N A that codes for toxin Cn2), were used to screen a lambda gtl 1 c D N A library prepared from C. noxius Hoffmann (CnH) venom glands. F r o m these two screenings we detected several positive signals with different intensities. As the required c D N A s should be very similar but not identical to their respective probes, we decided to characterize first the clones that gave intermediate intensities. The corresponding c D N A inserts were subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.) in order to be sequenced. A m o n g the clones showing intermediate signal intensities, the clones containing the c D N A s encoding toxins Cnl and Cn2 were found. The nucleotide (nt) sequences of clones CngtVI and CngtVII are shown in Fig. 1. These c D N A s are about 350 bp in length and encode toxin precursors of 86-87 aa. The c D N A encoding toxin Cn2 (CngtVII) lacks 16 nt (8 nt corresponding to 5' non-coding region and 8 nt encoding the first 3 aa of the signal peptide), as compared to c D N A encoding toxin

Cnl (CngtVI). This loss at the 5' end of C n g t V I I cDNA was probably due to incomplete elongation during the cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase. Comparative analyses between C n g t V I and C n g t V I I revealed a similarity of 56% at the aa level and 80% at the nt level. Similar results were reported when comparing other C. noxius cDNAs (Becerril et al., 1993). Since the deduced amino acid sequence in Fig. 1 suggested that the mature peptides were also processed at the C-terminal, with the possibility of amidation of the last amino acid residue (Vazquez et al., 1993), and because small discrepancies were apparent when comparing the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 1 with the published primary structures o f C n l (Possani et al., 1985) and Cn2 (Zamudio et al., 1992), the full determination of the amino acid sequence of both toxins were performed de novo, as described below.
Peptide sequence determination Reduced and carboxymethylated toxin Cnl was sequenced by direct Edman degradation up to residue at position 56, as shown in Fig. 2. Additional peptides were generated by enzymatic hydrolysis of RC-toxin Cnl (Fig. 3a). From the five main fragments obtained in this step the peptide eluting at 30.06 min (labelled with an asterisk in Fig. 3a) gave the amino acid sequence D S T P T W P L P N K T C S . This peptide fragment corresponded to the C-terminal region of Cnl, and clearly showed a proline (in bold, Fig. 2) at position 60, replacing threonine, previously reported (Possani et al., 1985). Additionally, it shows a serine in position 65, confirming the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 1. This serine residue at position 65 seems to be amidated, as described below. Similarly, automatic sequencing of a sample of RC-toxin Cn2 provided the N-terminal amino acid sequence up to residue 46 (Fig. 2). Digestion of RC-toxin Cn2 with protease V8 produced about 11 peptidic fragments (Fig. 3b). The peptide eluting at 35.55 min (labelled 1 in Fig. 3b) corresponded to residues from position 54 to 66, and was used for mass spectrometry analysis, from which the conclusion of an amidated serine at the end was suggested. Peptide 2 (Fig. 3b) showed the amino acid sequence C K Q Q Y G K G A G G Y C , corresponding to the position 29 to 41. This sequence showed that the previously published primary structure of Cn2 (Zamudio et al., 1992) had an inversion of

Fig. 2. Amino acid sequence of toxins C n l and Cn2. Cn 1: The total amino acid sequence of toxin Cnl was obtained by direct E d m a n degradation, from residues number 1 to 56 as shown by the under-labelling (:.d. >). An overlapping peptide purified by HPLC, after enzymatic cleavage with endopeptidase Asp-N of RC-toxin, was found to correspond to the C-terminal segment, from amino acid residue number 52 to 65, under-labelled with (:-aspN- >). The serine at position 65 was shown to be amidated by mass spectrometry (ms). Cn2: The total amino acid sequence of toxin Cn2 was obtained by direct sequencing from residues number 1 to 48 (labelled :.d. >), plus sequencing two additional peptides obtained through H P L C of RC-toxin digested with protease V8. Peptide labelled with V8 L corresponds to residues 54~66 of the primary structure, and peptide V82 is overlapping the sequence from residues 29 to 53. The serine at position 66 was shown to be amidated, both by nuclear magnetic resonance ( N M R ) and by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the overlapping is confirmed by the nucleotide sequence of Fig. I.

(a) RC-toxinCnl (approx. 100/~g)was digested with Asp-N endopeptidase and separated in a C18 reverse-column, using a linear gradient of 0% solvent A (0.10% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to 60% solvent B (0,12% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile), for 60 min. *Peptide corresponding to the C-terminal segment of Fig. 2. (b) RC-toxin Cn2 (approx. 100#g) was digested with Staphylococcus aureus protese V8 and separated in the same system as (a).

amino acids at positions 33 and 34 (bold in Fig. 2), tyrosine being the one at position 33 and glycine the one at position 34; hence confirming the nucleotide sequence found in Fig. 1. Toxin Cn2 was also analysed by N M R , as discussed below, and unequivocally showed that the last residue in position 66 was amidated.
M a s s spectrometry and ~ H - N M R spectroscopy The pure peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of Cn l, after cleavage with the protease Asp-N (labelled with an asterisk in Fig. 3a), was additionally submitted to mass spectroscopy analysis showing the presence of a mol. mass of 1602.7 indicating that the serine at the end, position 65, might be amidated. Similarly, the pure C-terminal peptide of RC-toxin Cn 2 (with sequence Q A I V W P L P N K R C S ) was analysed by mass spectrometry, giving a tool. mass of 1568.4, consistent with the presence of an amidated serine at the end of this peptide. Thus, these results confirmed both the amino acid sequence that was directly determined and the sequence inferred from the nucleotide sequence. Further confirmation of the results found for Cn2 toxin came from ~H-NMR spectroscopy analysis. Using a combination of 2D (two-dimensional)-NMR experiments, most of the protons in the Cn2 toxin have been assigned, and the N M R three-dimensional structure of Cn2 is under refinement (Lebreton, F., Gurrola, G. B., Possani, L. D. and Delepierre, M, in preparation). Owing to the characteristic pattern of serine spin system (Wuthrich, 1986) and to the uniqueness of this residue in the Cn2 sequence, the protons of the serine at position 66 (Ser66) were assigned unambiguously (with 6 H N : 8.79 ppm; 6H~: 4.49 ppm; 6H/~l: 3.91 ppm; ~5H/32:3.98 ppm). In the N O E S Y spectra, cross-peaks were observed between a proton at 7.47 ppm and Ser66: Ha, HN, and H/~ 1 protons. A smaller N O E

cross-peak was also present between a proton resonating at 7.24 ppm and Ser66: H~ proton. These two protons (at 7.47 and 7.24 ppm) are scalarly coupled as shown in the T O C S Y and P. COSY experiments. The ROESY experiment (Kessler et al., 1987), run with a mixing time of 200 msec at 303 K, indicates that these two protons are in chemical exchange, as expected for the protons of an amide function. Some of the connectivities

observed in the ROESY and NOESY spectra are shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, the two protons unambiguously assigned at 7.47 ppm and 7.24 ppm demonstrate the presence of the amidated serine at the C-terminal position. DISCUSSION The structure of the cDNAs reported (Fig. 1) shows the presence of an open reading frame encoding a signal peptide (19 aa for toxin Cnl) followed by a region encoding the mature peptide (65~66 aa) and two additional codons that code for a basic residue (Lys) preceded by a glycine residue, and finally a stop codon and 60-90 bp as a 3' non-coding region in which the polyadenylation site should be included (the latter is evident in the c D N A reported for toxin Cn2). A similar canonical structure has been reported for cDNAs encoding toxins of the North African scorpion Androctonus australis Hector (Bougis et al., 1989) and the Mexican scorpion Centruroides noxius (Becerril et al., 1993). The isolated and sequenced peptides from these scorpion venoms showed that they are processed in both ends: the signal peptides are eliminated and the C-terminal residues are processed given either a free carboxyl group or an amidated end-terminal amino acid residue. The basic residue situated in front of the codon of termination is not present in the mature peptides and when Gly precedes one or two basic residues, the residue preceding Gly becomes amidated (Bougis et aL, 1989; Vazquez et aL, 1993). According to these rules the carboxyl end of toxins Cnl and Cn2 should be: . . . cysteinyl-serinamide. This seems to be true for both toxins, as demonstrated by the N M R and mass spectroscopy data presented here. Unfortunately, the N M R spectroscopy data are not yet available for Cnl. However, the mass spectrometry and N M R data obtained for Cn2 leave no doubt that the rule discussed previously (Becerril et al., 1993; Bougis et aL, 1989; Vazquez et al., 1993) holds true, at least for the latter toxin, where the Ser66 is now definitively established to be amidated. The similarity at the nt level between C n g t V I and C n g t V I I suggests that these cDNAs originate from mRNAs transcribed from closely related genes. This last premise can be generalized for C n H toxin genes. We have proposed that toxins of scorpions of the Centruroides genus, specific for Na + channels, can be divided into three groups (Fig. 5) according to their primary sequences (Becerril et al., 1993). It has also been suggested that there is a relationship between the various groups of distinct amino acid sequences and the pharmacological properties (specific for mammals, crustaceans and insects) of the toxins included in each group or family of different peptides. The similarity among the cDNAs we have reported thus far, at the aa level fluctuates between 56% and 91%, but at the nt level oscillates between 80% and 92%. Even for cDNAs with 56% similarity at the aa level, the similarity in the region encoding the signal peptide and the 3' non-coding region is remarkable. This analysis led us to conclude that the genes encoding toxins of the Cn H venom have been generated from an ancestor gene which experienced several duplications, and each duplicated version evolved independently. This same phenomenon might have occurred in other species of the Centruroides genus. A similar event has been observed in the case of the North African scorpion A. australis Hector (Bougis et al., 1989). Returning to the discussion of the species specificity of the scorpion toxins, this subject is still under intense investigation. The groups in Fig. 5 were initially proposed based on sequence comparison (Becerril et al., 1993), but they also correspond to results obtained with the purified peptides using mice, crickets and crustaceans as bioassays. Examples of

the first group, which include peptides from scorpions of the genus Centruroides toxic to mice, were reported by Rochat et al. (1979) for C. suffusus suffusus toxin II (Fig. 5); Possani et al. (1982), Zamudio et al. (1992), Vazquez et al. (1993) for C. noxius toxins 2 (same as CngtVII), 3 and 4 (same as C n g t V in Fig. 5), respectively; and finally, for C. l. tecomanus toxin 1 (Cltl in Fig. 5) by Ramirez et al. (1988) and Martin et al. (1988). For purposes of comparison the sequences deduced from cDNAs (labelled CngtX, where X is a Roman number in Fig. 5) include the unprocessed end terminal residues. The consensus residues (Cons. 1, bottom part of group 1 in Fig. 5), meaning identical amino acids at the same position in all sequences, are very high. Furthermore, toxins Cn2 and Cn3 were shown to be non-toxic to crustaceans, at doses lethal to mice (Serrano, S. and Possani, L. D., unpublished observations). The second group contains examples of representative toxins specific to insects, such as the variants 1, 2 and 3 (Csvl-3 in Fig. 5) from the scorpion C. sculpturatus, as described by Babin et al. (1974), and minor corrections for variant 3 by Fontecilla-Camps et al. (1980). This group includes two amino acid sequences deduced from cDNAs (CngtII and CngtIII, Fig. 5), from which only CngtII has already been isolated as an expressed peptide. It turns out to be toxic to insects and crustaceans, but definitively non-toxic to mammals. Also included is Cll 1, a new crustacean toxin isolated from C. limpidus limpidus scorpion (Lebreton et al., 1994). The consensus sequence (Cons. 2) for this group is striking.

Fig. 5. Amino acid sequence comparison of main representatives of Centruroides scorpion toxins. These sequences were grouped according to their similarities. Gaps ( ) were introduced where necessary to maximize similarities. Below each group a consensus sequence is shown in bold. For consensus sequence X means variable residue. Amino acid sequences deduced from c D N A s (denoted as Cngt and a R o m a n number) are included. The last two residues at the carboxyl end of the peptides encoded by Cngt I], V, VI and VII cDNAs, are not present in the mature toxin. The last two residues of the peptides encoded by c D N A s III and 1V (peptides not yet isolated from the venom) are presumably not present either. The aa are aligned with the last digits of the numerals. The carboxyl ends of the mature peptides encoded by CngtV (Vazquez et al., 1993), CngtVI and C n g t V I I (this study), are asparagine-amide, serine-amide and serine-amide, respectively. Data are from this study, Becerril et al. (1993), Meves et al. (1984), Zamudio et al. (1992) and Lebreton et al. (1994).

The third group contains toxin Cn 1 (same as CngtVI, Fig. 5) which was originally said to be toxic to mice (Possani et al., 1985), but has turned out to be rather toxic to crustaceans (Serrano, S. and Possani, L. D., unpublished observations). The initial purified toxin Cnl (Possani et al., 1985) contained a small contaminant of toxin Cn7, which is one of the most toxic peptides to mammals, isolated from the venom of C. noxius, with Ko = 40 pM to rat brain synaptosomes (Valdivia et al., 1994). Thus, toxin Cnl was assayed in crustaceans, showing a considerable degree of toxicity, but was non-toxic to mice at doses up to 100 #g/20 g mouse. The peptide coded for CngtlV (Fig. 5) is still unknown. Toxin CsEI, from C. sculpturatus (Babin et al., 1974), is toxic to cockerels. Thus, the latter group, which also has an important consensus sequence (Cons. 3, Fig. 5) is less well studied and is not strictly specific to crustaceans. In conclusion, the various groups of toxins compared in Fig. 5 seem to show, grosso modo, a certain degree of species specificity. Although more experiments are under way to refine the data, it is worth noting that similar primary structures are apparently conditioning similar pharmacological effects in vivo.
Note added in proof--While this manuscript was under revision a new set of experiments was conducted with

toxin Cn 1 by an independent operator, showing unequivocally that this peptide is amidated at the end terminal residue (serine-amide). RC-toxin 1 from C, noxius was cleaved de novo with endopeptidase Asp-N, separated by HPLC (similarly to Fig. 3a) and the peptide corresponding to the C-terminal segment (residues 52~55) was analysed by mass spectrometry. Eight spectra were obtained and using three ions per spectrum (the all 12 C, the 13 C1 and 13 C2 doubly charged species) gave 24 data points which gave an average mol. wt of 1602.73, consistent with an amidated C-terminal amino acid residue. The authors wish to thank Dr Carl Ijames, from N.I.M.H., for running these spectra and calculating the mol. wt of the peptide.
