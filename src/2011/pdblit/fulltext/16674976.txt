CheY is a member of the response regulator protein superfamily that controls the chemotactic swimming response of motile bacteria. The CheY double mutant D13K Y106W (CheY**) is resistant to phosphorylation, yet is a highly effective mimic of phosphorylated CheY in vivo and in vitro. The conformational attributes of this protein that enable it to signal in a phosphorylation-independent manner are unknown. We have solved the crystal structure of selenomethionine-substituted CheY** in the presence of its target, a peptide (FliM16) derived from the flagellar motor switch, FliM, ° to 1.5 A resolution with an R-factor of 19.6%. The asymmetric unit contains four CheY** molecules, two with FliM16 bound, and two without. The two CheY** molecules in the asymmetric unit that are bound to FliM16 adopt a conformation similar to BeFK-activated wild-type CheY, and also bind 3 FliM16 in a nearly identical manner. The CheY** molecules that do not bind FliM16 are found in a conformation similar to unphosphorylated wild-type CheY, suggesting that the active phenotype of this mutant is enabled by a facile interconversion between the active and inactive conformations. Finally, we propose a ligand-binding model for CheY and CheY**, in which Ile95 changes conformation in a Tyr/Trp106-dependent manner to accommodate FliM.

Introduction
Two-component signal transduction networks are a ubiquitous means of responding to diverse environmental stimuli in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. In these networks, signals are propagated by means of reversible phosphorylation. The activity of the first component, an autohistidine kinase, is controlled by proteins that respond to

environmental signals. The target of this kinase is the second component, termed the response regulator, which can be phosphorylated at a conserved aspartate residue. The phosphorylation state of the response regulator directly governs the magnitude of a particular output (e.g. gene expression or motor bias). CheY is the response regulator protein that controls chemotaxis in motile bacteria.1 Because CheY has been extensively studied using genetic, biochemical, and biophysical techniques, it has been called the "prototype" response regulator.2 CheY functions by binding the flagellar motor switch protein, FliM, to change the direction of the flagellar motor from counterclockwise (smoothswimming phenotype) to clockwise (tumbly phenotype).3,4 Phosphoryl-CheY (CheYwP) binds FliM with approximately 20-fold higher affinity than non-phosphorylated CheY.5 Therefore, the swimming behavior of the cell can be continuously

1326 modulated in response to chemoattractant and chemorepellent gradients by changing the intracellular concentration of CheYwP. While the three-dimensional structure of CheY has been determined,6 the high autodephosphorylation rate of CheYwP has precluded efforts to obtain its structure. Attempts to chemically synthesize a stable analog of the phosphorylationinduced conformation in vitro have met with success. Beryllofluoride-CheY,7,8 and to a somewhat lesser extent phosphono-CheY,9,10 have amide chemical shifts and FliM-binding affinities (KdZ 26 mM and 38 mM, respectively) that mimic that of CheYwP (27 mM)5 rather than CheY (ca 600 mM).5,7 The structures of these activated CheYs have provided details about the function of conserved residues in binding magnesium, stabilizing the phosphoryl group, and transmitting the signal from the active site to the remote target binding site.10,11 Beryllofluoride-CheY ðBeFKK CheYÞ in 3 complex with a FliM peptide provided the first structure of a response regulator bound to its target.12 A number of CheY mutants have been identified that cause both a hyperactive (increased tumbling) phenotype in vivo and increased FliM-binding in vitro. Two such activating mutants, CheYD13K and CheYD13K Y106W (CheY**), are essentially non-phosphorylatable, inviting the hypothesis that they are able to adopt the active conformation in the absence of a phosphoryl group.13 However, such a hypothetical structure was not found in crystalline CheYD13K, which had a conformation nearly identical to that of unphosphorylated wild-type CheY.14 As a result, questions concerning the conformational basis of activity in this family of mutants (i.e. do these mutationally activated CheYs bind FliM in a manner similar to beryllofluoride-activated CheY?) have gone unanswered. In the absence of phosphodonor, CheY** has been shown to be a highly effective mimic of CheYwP as assayed by swimming behavior,13,15 extent of crosslinking to FliM in vivo,16 and FliM peptide affinity (KdZ55 mM) in vitro.2 Because mutant proteins (in contrast to chemically modified ones) can be genetically introduced into the cell, elucidating the "active" structure of an activating mutant has the powerful potential to link CheYwP-like activity in vivo to a particular CheY conformation. Here, we present the crystal structure of CheY** in the presence of a peptide (FliM16) derived from the 16 N-terminal residues of FliM. Fortuitously, half of the CheY** molecules in the asymmetric unit are bound to FliM16, while half remain uncomplexed. This allows direct comparison of the free and bound states of CheY**, and shows them to be conformationally distinct. In the unbound ("resting") state, CheY** (like CheYD13K) has a conformation similar to unphosphorylated wild-type CheY.6 The FliM 16-bound conformation, however, closely resembles that of BeFK-activated wild-type CheY.11 3 Moreover, the details of the FliM16 binding site, as well as the conformation of FliM16, are nearly

identical to that found in the BeFK-CheY-FliM16 3 complex.12 These observations suggest that activating mutations do not cause the protein to switch constitutively to the active conformation. Rather, they suggest that these mutations allow a more facile transformation to the active form.

Results
General description of structural results CheY** in complex with its target, a 16-residue peptide (FliM16) derived from the N terminus of the flagellar motor switch protein FliM, crystallized in ° space group P1 and diffracted to 1.46 A. The six polypeptides in the unit cell form two pairs of biological units: (i) free CheY** and (ii) CheY** in a 1 : 1 complex with FliM16. We define the two unbound versions of CheY** as chains C and D. The CheY** chains bound to the FliM peptide are denoted as chains A and B with their bound peptides denoted as E and F, respectively. All protein and peptide residues are clearly defined in the final 2FoKFc map with the following exceptions: residues 1 to 3 of the FliM peptide (chains E and F), and residues 126­129 of free CheY (chain A only). These residues (with the exception of the selenium atom and C3 carbon of SeMet129) are not included in the final model. Two conformations with half-unit occupancy were used to model Asn31 of peptide-bound CheY** (chains A and B), and Met60 of free CheY** (chains C and D). CheY** changes conformation upon binding FliM16 The average r.m.s. deviation of Ca atoms between non-crystallographic symmetry related CheY** molecules (chains A and B or chains C and D) was small ° (0.09 and 0.10 A, respectively). In contrast, there are significant conformational differences between peptide-bound and peptide-free CheY** molecules (Ca ° r.m.s.dZ1.0 A). The largest differences cluster in three regions: a-helix 1, the b4/a4 loop, and the b5/a5 loop (Figure 1). A smaller region of difference occurs around residue 48 (residues 49 and 50 are glycine) in the a2/b3 loop. The following Ca ° positions change by more than 1.5 A: 48, 87­91, 110­114, and 117. A clearly defined difference between the free and bound CheY** conformations is the repositioning of the tryptophan side-chain at position 106. This tryptophan, which replaces the native tyrosine, has a different rotameric conformation in peptide-free as compared to peptide-bound CheY** (Dc1Z1298). In the complex with FliM16, the indole group of Trp106 occupies an internal site, while in free CheY** this aromatic ring is in an external, solvent-exposed position (Figure 2). The "buried" conformation of Trp106 is stabilized by burial of hydrophobic surface area and an H-bond between the indole nitrogen of Trp106 and the backbone

Figure 1. The plot in blue shows the differences in Ca positions between free and FliM16-bound CheY** (chains D and B, respectively). For comparison, the plot in red shows an equivalent comparison of the structure of wildtype CheY (3CHY) with that of BeFK-CheY in complex 3 with FliM16 (1F4V, chain A). In the latter case the large difference in conformation at the C terminus (125­129) appears to result from interactions with neighbor molecules in the crystal of the BeFK-CheY­FliM16 complex. 3 Superpositions were performed using all Ca atoms.

° carbonyl at position 89 (2.8 A), which appears to stabilize the b4/a4 loop. The "exposed" conformation of Trp106 appears to result from a combination of stabilizing hydrophobic interactions with Ile95, and destabilizing steric forces associated with the position of the Thr87 methyl group, which occludes Trp106 from the cavity. The tyrosine at position 106 in wild-type CheY has been implicated in signaling17 and exists in both the buried and exposed conformations as well (see Discussion).6 Active site comparison The active site of CheY** also undergoes a significant rearrangement between peptide-free and peptide-bound conformations, in the absence of magnesium or the phosphoryl moiety. In the peptide-free conformation (Figure 3(a)), active site interactions include an H-bond between the Lys109 3-amino group and a carboxylate oxygen of Asp57 ° (3.0 A), a water-mediated interaction of the Lys109 3-amino group and the carboxylate group of Asp12, and a hydrogen bond between the mutant Lys13 3amino group and the backbone carbonyl at position ° 59 (2.8 A). The Lys13 3-amino group, backbone amide, Asn59 backbone carbonyl, and a carboxylate oxygen of Asp57 interact through an ordered water molecule that resides in the magnesium binding site of wild-type CheY. An ordered water molecule at this position was also observed in the crystal structure of wild-type CheY in the absence of magnesium.6 With the exception of interactions
Figure 2. Tryptophan 106 moves from a solventexposed position in resting state CheY** (a) to a buried position when FliM16 is bound (b). As a result, in resting state CheY** both Trp106 and Thr87 are located away from the active site (a), whereas they are sequestered toward the active site in the complex (b). In wild-type CheY (which has a Tyr instead of a Trp at position 106) an analogous coordinated movement of Thr87 and Tyr106 (termed Y-T coupling) occurs during activation. FliM16 is shown in green. (a) and (b) were generated with CheY** chains D and B, respectively.

associated with the mutant lysine at position 13, the active site of free CheY** has a hydrogen bonding pattern and solvent structure that are very similar to that of magnesium-free wild-type CheY. In FliM16-bound CheY** (Figure 3(b)), the Lys109 side-chain is repositioned so that the 3-amino group

two helical turns comprising residues 8p to 15p (Figure 4). This peptide conformation is stabilized by several intramolecular interactions, including hydrophobic contacts between Leu6p and Ile11p, and a pair of backbone­side-chain hydrogen bonds between Ser7p and Glu10p. The CheY**­FliM16 interface is largely identical to the BeFK-CheY­FliM16 interface, though slightly 3 ° less surface area is buried (991 A2 versus 2 12 ° ). Intermolecular contacts that comprise 1110 A this interface in the extended portion of the peptide (residues 4p to 7p) include hydrogen bonds between the backbone carbonyl of Ser4p and the backbone amide of CheY** Lys92, and between the backbone carbonyl of CheY** Ala90 and the backbone amide of Leu6p. In the helical portion of the peptide, several hydrophobic side-chains reside on the surface facing the CheY** molecule, including Leu6p, Ile11p, and Leu15p. These residues form a hydrophobic cluster with Ile95, Ala99, Trp106, and Val108 of CheY**. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds stabilizing the complex are found between the Gln8p side-chain carboxyl and backbone amide of Val108, as well as between the Asn16p side-chain carboxyl and the backbone amide of Trp106. In addition, a salt bridge is formed between the Lys119 side-chain of CheY** and the Asp12p side-chain of FliM16. Finally, a quartet of hydrogen bond partners, formed by an association of the Gln8p sidechain amine, the Asp12p side-chain carboxylate oxygen ðO31 Þ, the Asn16p side-chain amine, and the Trp106 backbone carboxyl, stabilizes both the peptide conformation and the peptide­protein complex. In contrast to the BeFK-CheY-FliM16 complex, 3 Lys122 does not form a strong salt bridge with the bound peptide. Instead, it forms a weak salt bridge

can interact with a carboxylate oxygen of Asp12 ° (2.7 A). The 3-amino group of Lys109 continues to interact with a carboxylate oxygen of Asp57, though at a much longer distance and with an intervening water molecule. This carboxylate oxygen of Asp57 now also interacts with the hydroxyl oxygen of Thr87 through a well-ordered water molecule. This water, as well as two other well-ordered water molecules that are in close proximity to Asp57, form an equilateral triangle that is similar to the positions of the fluorine atoms in BeFK-activated CheY.11 3 Thus, in the peptide-bound conformation, the active site arrangement closely approximates that of BeFK-activated wild-type CheY, except that water 3 molecules, rather than the BeFK group, mediate the 3 interaction between Asp57 and Thr87. CheY**­FliM16 contacts In the complex with CheY**, electron density was uninterpretable for residues 1p­3p of the peptide, likely due to disorder (the superscript p is used throughout to distinguish residues of the peptide from residues of the protein). FliM16 residues 4p to 7p adopt an extended conformation, followed by

with the Asn16p carboxylate in CheY** chain A, and extends into a solvent channel in the symmetryrelated CheY** molecule (chain B). This behavior of Lys122 appears to account for the bulk of the ° difference in buried surface area (991 A2 versus ° 1110 A2)12 for the CheY**­peptide complex as compared to the BeFK-activated CheY­peptide 3 complex. FliM16 binding to CheY** is correlated with the rotameric conformation of Trp106 and the terminal methyl group of Ile95 The degree to which FliM16-binding induces the conformational change in CheY** versus selecting a pre-existing conformation has been a subject of discussion in the literature. This cannot be resolved by the structures of the free and bound states presented here. However, regardless of the temporal order of binding and conformational change, it is clear that the two are tightly correlated. As mentioned earlier, a large change in the rotameric orientation of CheY** Trp106 is perhaps the most striking component of the global conformational change that accompanies FliM16-binding. This residue is solvent-exposed in the absence of bound FliM16, and is buried in the CheY**­FliM16 complex (Figure 2). If the complex and the free CheY** structures are superimposed, then Trp106 in the exposed position sterically clashes with Ile11p of the peptide. This indicates that the free CheY** conformation is not competent to bind FliM16 without conformational rearrangement. When Trp106 is in the buried position, this unfavorable steric interaction is eliminated. In order for Trp106 to move to the buried position the methyl group of Thr87 has to move. Interestingly, in the crystal structure of the activating single mutant Y106W, Trp106 is seen in the buried position in the absence of peptide.18 Thus it appears that there are subtle structural and energetic features that determine the predominant position of Trp106 in this family of mutant forms. It is likely that the energetic differences between the buried and exposed positions are small in the absence of peptide. A second residue on the FliM16-binding surface of CheY** whose conformation is mediated by the presence of the peptide is Ile95. In the absence of bound FliM16, the terminal methyl ðCd Þ of Ile95 is exposed to solvent ("out"), while it is buried ("in") in the complex (Figure 5(a)). The movement of Trp106 to the interior of the protein exposes the Ile95 side-chain, enabling it to interact with Ile11p of FliM. By analogy to the exposed position of Trp106, the "out" rotamer of the Ile95 terminal methyl appears to discourage access of FliM16 to its binding site via steric conflict with Ile11p. In contrast, the "in" rotamer of the Ile95 terminal methyl allows it to form productive hydrophobic contacts with both Trp106 (buried) and Ile11p of FliM16. This movement of the Ile95 terminal methyl is also seen in a comparison of inactive wild-type CheY 6 and the BeFK-activated CheY­FliM 16 3

(b) Inactive wild-type CheY (Mg2C-free) is shown in white, BeFK-activated CheY is shown in orange, and the 3 BeFK-activated CheY­FliM16 complex is shown in green. 3 The steric conflict that would result between Ile95 Cd out ° and Ile11p of FliM16 (w2.5 A) is depicted as a red dotted line. Superpositions were performed using all Ca atoms in the molecule, rather than just those shown. Bound and free CheY** (a) were modeled using chain B and D, respectively.

complex (Figure 5(b)).12 It might be assumed that the movement of the aromatic residue at position 106 and the terminal methyl ðCd Þ of Ile95 happen in concert. However, such a mechanism is unlikely in light of both the BeFK-activated CheY structure11 3 (Figure 5(b)) and the structure of the activating single mutant Y106W,18 in which the aromatic at position 106 is buried and Ile95 is out. Rather, we propose a two-step mechanism in which the burial of the aromatic at position 106 is necessary, but not sufficient to reorient the Ile95 Cd methyl group. In the second step, following the burial of position 106 and concomitant with the binding of FliM16, the Ile95 Cd methyl reorients to the in position, driven

1330 by the favorable interaction between activated CheY and FliM16.

Discussion
CheY** and wild-type CheY take on similar conformations in the resting state At the physiological level CheY** appears to be a phenocopy of the phosphorylated form of wildtype CheY.13,15 It might be expected that CheY** would take on an activated conformation similar to that of CheYwP. However, it is clear that in the absence of FliM16, CheY** is predominantly in an inactive conformation similar to the conformation of unphosphorylated wild-type CheY.6 This is distinctly different from the conformation seen when wild-type CheY is activated in its complex with BeFK but in the absence of the FliM16 target.11 3 The most notable differences in the CheY (Mg2C free) structure resulting from the D13K/Y106W double mutation (in the absence of peptide) are (1) the exclusive outward orientation of Trp106 in CheY** as compared to the dual conformations of Tyr106 observed in wild-type, (2) decreased order of the b4/a4 loop, and (3) some alterations in the hydrogen bonding pattern in the vicinity of the D13K mutation. A least-squares superposition of peptide-free CheY** and Mg2C-free, inactive CheY6 reveals a high degree of similarity between the two ° molecules (Ca r.m.s.d.Z0.5 A), which persists even at the level of the active site solvent structure. Diffraction data collected for crystalline CheY** alone, which will be presented elsewhere, confirm that this conformation is not an artifact of the adjacent CheY**­FliM16 complexes in the crystal. Furthermore, the assigned chemical shifts in the 15N HSQC NMR spectra of uniformly N15 labeled CheY** (in the absence of FliM16) closely resemble the shifts of inactive wild-type CheY (C.M.D. & F.W.D., unpublished results). Only two resonances (Phe14 and Gly76) undergo large shifts relative to the wild-type case. While we are still analyzing the reasons for the shifts seen in these two residues, it is clear that the inactive conformation predominates in solution and no global conformation change has occurred as a result of the mutations. There is also little evidence of exchange broadening in the spectra of CheY** suggesting that the interconversion between the active and inactive conformations is fast on the millisecond timescale. To reconcile this apparent paradox between the inactive-like structure and the active-like functional properties of this mutant, we propose that the activated conformation is more energetically accessible to this mutant, at least in the presence of FliM16, though the inactive wild-type conformation is still preferred under resting state conditions. We should point out that a similar activation pathway was proposed for the less hyperactive D13K single mutant, which also crystallized in the inactive conformation in the absence of FliM16.14 The

authors suggest that the D13K mutation, which results in reorientation of Asp57 and weakening of the H-bond interaction between Lys109 and Asp57, may render the D13K inactive conformation "a metastable state of the molecule," resulting in greater accessibility of the active conformation.14 Similar reasoning could be applied to the double mutant CheY**, which, in the absence of FliM16, has an active site that is nearly identical to that of the D13K single mutant. There is growing evidence that CheY and other response regulatory domains sample multiple conformations that are likely similar to the active and inactive forms that we observe here.19­21 This may well reflect the structural similarities in these domains and the relatively small energy difference between the active and inactive forms in these homologous systems. The active state of CheY is structurally conserved FliM16 binds to the a4-b5-a5 face of CheY**, resulting in a conformational change in CheY** (Ca ° r.m.s.d.Z1.0 A; Figure 1). A conformational change of similar magnitude accompanies the binding of Mg2C, BeFK, and FliM peptide by wild-type CheY 3 ° (Ca r.m.s.d.Z1.0 A). The overall structures of the K BeF3 -CheY­FliM16 complex and the CheY**­FliM16 ° complex are quite similar (Ca r.m.s.d.Z0.5 A). Thus the activated CheY conformation is conserved with respect to chemical and mutational activation. Though no crystals containing exclusively CheY**­ FliM16 complexes have been reported to date, we think it is highly unlikely that the conformation of CheY** in complex with FliM16 presented here is an artifact of neighboring unbound CheY** molecules or crystal packing forces. In support of this assertion, it can be noted that the present structure as well as two distinct activated structures11,12 are all very similar, even though all three have different space groups. We also dismiss the possibility of a functional CheY** multimer due to (1) the small contact area between adjacent CheY** molecules, (2) the lack of a similar tertiary arrangement in crystals of the BeFK-CheY­FliM16 complex12, and (3) pre3 vious reports that demonstrate the very high monometric propensity of CheY.11 In the active site, bound CheY** attains the hydrogen bonding pattern of phosphorylated wild-type CheY by virtue of three well-ordered water molecules that substitute for the three phosphoryl oxygen atoms (Figure 3(b)). This arrangement allows for communication between the phosphorylation site and the effector binding site by substituting a water-mediated interaction of the Asp57 and Thr87 side-chains for an interaction mediated by a phosphoryl oxygen. By maintaining
 This calculation ignores the four C-terminal residues of CheY (126­129), as they adopt a significantly different conformation in the two crystal structures, apparently as a result of crystal packing forces.

1331 interacting with bound FliM16. Furthermore, an Ile to Val mutation at this position (I95V) results in a hyperactive phenotype in vivo,23 and has enhanced affinity for FliM16 in vitro, in both phosphorylated (sevenfold increase) and non-phosphorylated (threefold increase) forms.2 A comparison of the free and FliM16-bound CheY** structures presented here indicates that Ile95 Cd methyl moves from "out" to "in" when FliM16 binds (Figure 5(a)). A comparison of inactive wild-type CheY,6 BeFK-activated CheY,11 and the 3 BeFK-CheY­FliM16 complex12 suggests that, in con3 trast to Tyr106, the repositioning of Ile95 is not a consequence of the activated conformation, but is instead correlated with FliM16-binding (Figure 5(b)). This leads us to formulate a two-step model to describe the interaction between activated CheY (CheY** or BeFK-CheY) and FliM16 whereby Tyr/ 3 Trp106 and Cd of Ile95 are sequentially relocated from solvent-exposed to buried positions to generate the high-affinity FliM interface. In the first step, the active site communicates with the peptide binding site via the previously described Y/W-T coupling mechanism, whereas the movement of Ile95 Cd in the second step results primarily from local interactions, such as steric interference with bound FliM and the identity (Tyr or Trp) of the buried aromatic side-chain at position 106. The structure of BeFK-activated CheY11 (Figure 5(b)), 3 which represents an intermediate (Tyr106 buried, Ile95 methyl out) between the free and bound states of CheY, is consistent with such a two-step binding mechanism. Additionally, this model stipulates that the burial of the aromatic at position 106 is necessary, but not sufficient to enable high-affinity FliM-binding. In support of this assertion, a loss of the Tyr side-chain (Y106A) results in a loss-offunction phenotype and twofold decrease in affinity for FliM16.24 This result indicates that the lack of Y106 in the exposed position is, of itself, insufficient to generate the high-affinity FliM interface, supporting a functional role for Y106 buried, as our model suggests. An essential feature of the model is that the resting state conformation of Ile95 Cd ("out") sterically inhibits the binding of FliM, and that the ability of FliM-binding to relieve this inhibition is related to the rotameric disposition and identity of the aromatic side-chain at position 106. In BeFK3 activated CheY, NMR evidence indicates that Tyr106 and Ile95 are in contact.8 The crystal structure of CheY I95V,2 which differs significantly from wild-type CheY only at the mutation site and by the predominantly solvent-exposed Tyr106, provides evidence that these residues (95 and 106) interact in a specific fashion. Because it is highly improbable that the exposed position of 106 leads to increased FliM16-binding (due to steric overlap, see above), we imagine that the loss of the Ile95 Cd methyl group caused by the I/V mutation is directly responsible for the increased affinity of CheY I95V for FliM16, at least in the unphosphorylated state. We assume that in CheY I95V

this interaction, FliM16-bound CheY** is able to effectively support coupling between Thr87 and Trp106, dubbed Y-T coupling in wild-type, W-T coupling here. The essential feature of this communication pathway is the ability of Asp57 to sequester Thr87 in the direction of the active site by interacting with its side-chain hydroxyl. This necessarily moves the methyl group of Thr87 toward the active site, which widens the cavity adjacent to position 106, and facilitates the burial of the aromatic residue at that position (Figure 2). The role of Tyr106 in CheY signaling Among the response regulator class of proteins, position 106 (or its equivalent) is highly conserved as an aromatic residue (Tyr or Phe). Mutation of this position to residues other than Phe or Trp (Y106X, XZL,I,G,V,C) obliterates propagation of the chemotactic signal in Escherichia coli, and even Phe or Trp at this position severely inhibits chemotaxis.17 The crystal structures of several mutants at, or affecting, position 106 in CheY (T87I,22 Y106W and Y106W/T87I18) suggested a straightforward model of the role of this position in propagating the chemotactic signal. A mutation that buries the aromatic residue at position 106 on the interior of the protein, Y106W, is hyperactive in signaling ("tumbly" phenotype), while mutations that lock the aromatic at 106 in a solvent-exposed position (T87I, Y106W/T87I) do not signal ("smooth swimming" phenotype). Therefore, a model was proposed in which CheY is inactive when position 106 is exposed, and active when 106 is buried.18 Further support for this model came from the two structures of BeFK-activated CheY (alone11 and in 3 complex with FliM1612), both of which locate Tyr106 in the interior. Additionally, the structure of BeFK-activated CheY in complex with FliM16 3 indicates that it is improbable that FliM16 binds to CheY with Tyr106 exposed due to steric overlap with Ile11p of FliM16. In light of the well-supported role of position 106 in CheY activation, it is somewhat surprising that the CheY** double mutation results in an exterior positioning of Trp106, whereas the Y106W mutation alone results in burial of Trp106, and the D13K single-mutant does not affect the wild-type dualconformations of Tyr106. As mentioned above, we imagine that the energetic differences associated with the buried and exposed conformations of Trp106 are small (in the absence of FliM16). FliM16-binding correlates with relocation of the Ile95 terminal methyl in mutationally and chemically activated CheY The importance of CheY residue 95 in binding FliM has been well established. The Bourret laboratory has shown that a series of non-conservative point mutants at this position result in a loss-offunction phenotype.2 In addition, the structure of the BeFK-CheY­FliM16 complex shows Ile95 directly 3

1332 the relocation of Tyr106 to the interior is a relatively low energy event, and that elimination of the need to relocate Ile95 Cd to prevent steric interference with FliM16 provides the excess binding energy. Though no structural data are presently available for phosphorylated CheY 195V, we imagine that the reduction in steric inhibition associated with deletion of Ile95 Cd is also primarily responsible for the enhanced affinity of this mutant form for FliM16, consistent with our proposed model. Evidence that Ile95 responds to the chemical nature of position 106 comes from 13C HSQC spectra of uniformly methyl-labeled wild-type CheY, BeFK-CheY, and 3 CheY**. These spectra for wild-type CheY and CheY** are very similar, except for large changes in the chemical shifts of the Ile95 Cd and Cg2 methyl groups (C.M.D. & F.W.D., unpublished results). In BeFK-CheY, the chemical shift of the later resonance 3 is essentially the same as in wild-type CheY, indicating that the magnetic environment of this methyl group is influenced by the adjacent Trp mutation at position 106 in a manner that is distinct from the influence of Tyr exposed (wild-type CheY) or Tyr buried (BeFK-CheY) at the same position. In 3 aggregate, the biological, crystallographic and NMR data indicate that Ile95 is responsive to both the rotameric disposition and chemical nature of the aromatic side-chain at position 106, supporting a central feature of our model. Finally, we should point out the interaction between Ala90 and Ile95 side-chains in resting CheY**. In unbound CheY** Ala90 Cb and Ile95 Cd ° interact closely (3.2 A), while they are separated by ° in FliM16-bound CheY**. Crystalmore than 5 A lographic B-factors also decrease significantly in this region when FliM16 binds, suggesting increased order (data not shown). This arrangement is analogous to the resting6 and FliM16-bound12 states of wild-type CheY (unactivated and BeFK-activated, 3 respectively), and likely affects the conformation of the Ile95 terminal methyl ðCd Þ. Additionally, the conformation and/or flexibility of this loop may affect FliM16-binding directly, as the peptide forms specific backbone contacts (to Ala90 CO and Lys92 NH) in this region of CheY and CheY** that are characteristic of an antiparallel b-sheet.12 However, the large thermal parameters for the b4/a4 loop in resting CheY** and the high variability of this region in the family of CheY structures make drawing conclusions difficult. As such, we are reticent to speculate on the influence of the b4/a4 loop in our FliM-binding model described above.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification, crystallization, and data collection CheY** was overexpressed and purified using the previously described protocol for wild-type E. coli CheY.25 The FliM peptide, consisting of E. coli FliM residues 1 to 16 (MGDSILSQAEIDALLN) was purchased from Macromolecular Resources (Fort Collins, CO) at a minimum of 85% purity. A solution containing 0.6 mM CheY**, 1.2 mM FliM peptide, and 50 mM Tris (pH 7.9) was made by combining concentrated CheY (0.7 mM) with dissolved peptide (13 mM) in the presence of buffer. Diffraction-quality crystals of CheY** in complex with FliM were obtained at 4 8C from a screen that included 32­37% PEG 3350 plus 0.11­0.18 M ammonium sulfate, buffered by 50 mM Tris (pH 7.9). The crystals grew in around 12 days and belong to the space group P1. To minimize radiation damage, the crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen.26 Crystals were mounted in a nylon loop directly from the mother liquor in which they were grown and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen (w100 K). Crystals were kept in a cold nitrogen stream during data collection. Multi-wavelength diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. For each wavelength, 3608 of data were collected with an oscillation range of 1.08 and an exposure time of two seconds. Data were processed with D*trek (James Pflugrath, MSC, The Woodlands, TX, USA; Table 1). Structure determination by MAD phasing Initial attempts to solve the structure of the CheY**­ FliM16 complex with molecular replacement suggested that MAD phasing would simplify analysis. Crystals grown from SeMet CheY** (and native FliM16) grew isomorphously to native crystals, and allowed the determination of experimental phases. A total of 29 selenium atoms were located by SnB27 using SeMet multiple-energy anomalous dispersion (MAD) data. Initial refinement of heavy atom positions, B-factors, and occupancies was performed by SHARP.28 Three lowoccupancy sites were rejected, and one site was added, following inspection of an anomalous difference residual map using the program O.29 Further refinement with SHARP, including anisotropic B-factors, resulted in phases with a figure of merit of 0.63. The positions and occupancies of the 27 refined sites indicated that 24 unique selenium atoms had been located, of which three were doublets with approximately half-occupancy. Because CheY** contains seven methionine residues (after cleavage of Met1), the location of 24 selenium atoms was consistent with four CheY** molecules per unit cell, in agreement with the calculated Matthews coefficient (VM) of 1.90 A3/Da. The 27 sites were used by SHARP to generate the initial map, which was further improved with solvent flattening (SOLOMON30). Density corresponding to four CheY** molecules and two FliM peptides was unambiguous in the solvent-flattened experimentally phased maps. Automated backbone fitting by ARP w/ARP31 was used to locate roughly 80% of backbone atoms. Several programs (GETAX, 32 FINDNCS33) indicated the presence of two non-crystallographic 2-fold axes in the P1 unit cell. One of these relates the two peptide-free CheY** molecules of the unit cell, while the other relates the two peptide­CheY** complexes. The least-squares superposition program

 The authors of this paper suggest that Tyr106 "predominantly points out," though they do not exclude the possibility that, as the electron density suggests, a fraction of the crystalline molecules may bury Tyr106.  In fact, even in the context of a single crystal structure ° (wild-type CheY at 1.1 A), two distinct conformations of this loop, described as "inactive" and "meta-active" were found.21

LSQKAB34 was used to generate non-crystallographic symmetry rotation and translation matrices relating the molecules within each pair. After appropriate masks were created around NCS related pairs (MAPMASK32), NCS averaged experimental phased maps (SFALL,32 FFT32) and NCS averaged backbone positions (TNT35) were generated. The r.m.s. deviation in the backbone atom positions for NCS-related mol° ecules was less than 0.2 A prior to averaging. For the two unique structures (peptide-free CheY** and the CheY**­FliM16 complex), visible side-chains (O90%) and the remaining visible backbone were modeled into the two NCS-averaged map manually in O. From the two unique structures, the six polypeptide chains (two peptide-free CheY ** s, two peptide-bound CheY**s, and two FliM peptides) in the unit cell were generated by the NCS transformations described above using the program PDBSET.32 The R-factor of ° this initial model was 36% to 2.0 A resolution.

Structure refinement Refinement was performed using the program TNT.35 ° Initially, all B-factors were set to 20 A2, and grouped Bfactors were refined for all six polypeptides (four CheY** molecules and two FliM peptides) in the unit cell. After five cycles of refinement, grouped B-factors for the four ° CheY** molecules clustered around 20 A2, while the ° peptide-grouped B-factors were closer to 30 A2. In all following refinement cycles atomic coordinates and individual B-factors were refined simultaneously. A total of 385 cycles of refinement were performed, interspersed with rounds of rebuilding in O, based on the 2FoKFc, FoKFc, and solvent-flattened NCS-averaged maps. For the first 50 cycles, the resolution limit was set at ° 2.0 A and the atomic coordinates were completely constrained by NCS. During the next 100 cycles, the model was restrained by NCS with decreasing strictness, ° ° and the resolution limit was increased from 2.0 A to 1.7 A

1334
° in 0.1 A increments. During the final 235 cycles, water molecules and sulfate ions were picked manually, and the ° resolution limit was gradually increased from 1.7 to 1.5 A. No NCS restraints were used during these cycles. Because ° the average I/sig(I) fell below 2.0, reflections below 1.50 A resolution were excluded from refinement. A total of 576 water molecules and two sulfate ions with unit occupancies were modeled. Two additional sulfate ions were fit with partial occupancies. The resulting model has an Rfactor of 19.6% (RfreeZ27.4%) with reasonable geometry (Table 1). Structure analysis Ramachandran statistics were generated using PROCHECK36 (Table 1). In all four CheY** molecules, Asn62 (0.8% of residues) is found in a disallowed region due to its participation in a g-turn, as was addressed in detail in the original wild-type CheY structure.6 The least squares superposition program LSQKAB34 was used to superimpose various CheY structures, and also to calculate individual Ca differences and overall r.m.s. deviation between structures. Ca difference plots were generated using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA). Structural Figures were generated using MOLSCRIPT.37 Protein Data Bank accession codes Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the CheY**­FliM16 crystal have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, with accession code 1U8T.
