Abstract A glycoprotein of human renal dipeptidase expressed in Pichia pastorisoGS 115/pHIL-D2A DP4S has been crystallized, into the space group P21 with cell dimensions of a = 81.70 A, b = 81.74 A, c = 57.13 A and fl = 96.45 °. The dipeptidase is a homodimer consisting of two 42 kDa monomers. The monomer with 4 N-linked glycosylation sites is secreted in highly glycosylated forms that exhibit a molecular mass of about 45 kDa. In order to obtain diffraction-quality crystals, oligosaccharide moieties of this metal enzyme were trimmed by the endoglycosidase Hf treatment. The dipeptidase trimmed to 42 kDa retains nearly full catalytic activity. Crystals were obtained at 10°C by use of a 15 g/100 g polyethylene glycol 8000 precipitant of pH 5.6 and were further grown with the macroseeding technique. The crystal diffracts X-rays at least to 2 A resolution and is suitable for investigation of the three-dimensional structure.

1. Introduction Human renal dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.19) [ 1,2] is a membrane-bound glycoprotein involved in the hydrolysis of dipeptides [3]. Dipeptidases that hydrolyze only dipeptides have no activities toward tripeptide, oligopeptide and ester substrates [4]. The identities between the mammalian and the human dipeptidase sequences [3] are 82% for the rabbit [5], 76% for the rat [6], 74% for the mouse [7] and 81% for the pig enzymes [8]. These mammalian dipeptidases exhibit no significant sequence similarities to any other proteins [3]. Although the dipeptidases lack the His-Glu-X-X-His amino-acid sequences identified commonly in zinc proteases [9], zinc ions are re-

ported to be essential to their hydrolytic functions [10,11]. Though general roles in the organism are still unknown, the human renal dipeptidase hydrolyzes S(substitute)-L-cysteinyl-glycine adducts such as Lcystinyl-bis-glycine and S-N-ethylmaleimide-Lcysteinyl-glycine [12,13]. The enzyme is also responsible for the conversion of leukotriene D 4 to leukotriene E 4 [12,13] and for the hydrolysis of /3-1actam antibiotics [ 14]. These facts suggest that the enzyme plays important roles in the renal metabolism of glutathione, its conjugates and some drugs. The human renal dipeptidase is a homodimer consisting of two 42 kDa monomers [3]. The monomer with 4 N-linked glycosylation sites is secreted in highly glycosylated forms that often exhibit a molecular mass of about 62 kDa under reducing conditions [12]. In order to obtain diffraction-quality crystals, we expressed this metal enzyme in a Pichia

eties off the enzyme by glycosidase treatments. Crystals successfully obtained from the trimmed enzyme are well suited for the three-dimensional structural investigation.

2. Experimental procedure
In order to prepare the saccharide-trimmed human renal dipeptidase, we constructed the plasmid pHILD2ADP4S for the expression of soluble human renal dipeptidase. After the transformation of the plasmid into Pichia pastoris GS115 [15], transformants were screened for integration. A positive clone of P. pastoris GS 115/pHIL-D2 A DP4S- 1 was chosen and used for large scale expression. Total 20 L culture of the clone was grown for 2 days in media containing glycerol in baffled flasks. For induction of the expression, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 6 L of media containing methanol. After 3 days, the media were collected by centrifugation and filtered through Milidisk (Millipore). The filtrate was concentrated by ultrafiltration. After the dialysis against 50mM Tris-HCl, the sample was purified by employing DEAE-Sepharose, Zn 2÷chelating-Sepharose and Cilastatin-Sepharose columns. The purified sample of 50 mg was incubated with 5 000 000 units of endoglycosidase Hf in the presence of 2% octyl-/3-D-glycopyranoside at 37°C for 16 h. After the treatment with endoglycosidase Hf, the sample was further purified by employing Zn2+-chelating-Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose columns. The trimmed dipeptidase was concentrated by ultracentrifugation (details will be reported elsewhere). Crystals of the dipeptidase were grown at 10°C with the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, by use of 24-well tissue-culture plates. In the early stage of this study, human dipeptidase expressed in baculovirus-infected silkworms (to be reported elsewhere) was subjected to crystallization experiments. Crystals were obtained, by mixing a 5 m g / m L protein solution with a reservoir solution containing 10-12% (weight/weight) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 10mM Zn(COO) 2 and 20mM sodium cacodylate buffer of pH 6.5.

In the crystallization of the trimmed dipeptidase, droplets containing 10 m g / m L protein and 7.5% PEG 8000 (pH 5.6) were equilibrated against reservoir solutions of 15% PEG 8000 (pH 5.6). Boxshaped crystals were obtained after a few days. These crystals were seeded in droplets of the solution containing l0 m g / m L protein and 10% PEG 8000 (pH 5.6). The seeded droplets were equilibrated against reservoir solutions of 12% PEG 8000 (pH 5.6). The crystals thus grown were stored in a standard mother liquor consisting of 20% PEG 8000 and 0.2M 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazinyl] ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.6). Each of the crystals was sealed in a thin-walled quartz capillary with a silicone wax. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 4°C on the oscillation camera that automatically reads out diffraction patterns recorded on Imaging Plates (Fuji Photo Film Co.). Nickel-filtered Cu K a X-rays from a rotatinganode generator operated at 50 kV and 100 mA were focused on the specimen crystal by a pair of platinum-coated mirrors. The camera and the generator were specially designed by Y.S. and manufactured by Rigaku. Integration, scaling and post refinement of diffraction intensities were performed with programs DENZO and SCALEPACK [16]. Calculation of the self-rotation function was performed with program X-PLOR [17!, using reflections in a spacing range from 8 ~, to 4 A.

3. Results
The Crystals of the dipeptidase from baculovirusinfected silkworms showed space group P41212 or its enantiomorphic P43212 and cell dimensions of a = 74.7 A and c = 204.9 ~,. These bipyramidal crystals grew to typical sizes of 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm, but diffracted X-rays only up to 4 A resolution. We judged that the crystals were poorly suited to highresolution structural studies. Assuming that an asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a monomer with a molecular mass of 42 kDa, which was estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), the V value representing m the crystal volume per unit molecular mass of protein [18] is estimated to be 3.40 A3/Da. This Vm value indicates that two monomers of the homo-

These indicate that the crystals from the trimmed dipeptidase are suitable for determination of the three-dimensional structure. The calculation of the self-rotation function gave a single prominent peak that corresponds to the rotation of 180 ° around the crystallographic b axis. This suggests that the two-fold axis possibly relating two monomers exists along the b axis.

Fig. 1. Photograph of the saccharide-trimmed human renal dipeptidase. The human dipeptidase was expressed in the Pichia pastoris system and was treated with endoglycosidase Hf so as to trim down saccharide moieties. The largest dimension for the crystal grown by the macroseeding is about 0.45 mm (one division corresponds to 0.025 mm).

4. Discussion The crystal of the pig enzyme was obtained from the supernatant of the 50-75% ammonium sulfate fraction in the purification process from pig kidney [20]. The enzyme redissolved from the crystal showed a molecular mass of 47 kDa, though no crystallographic study was reported on this crystal. The dipeptidase purified from human kidney showed a band at 62 kDa in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and at 130 kDa under non-reducing conditions [12]. Hence the human enzyme with 42 kDa polypeptides has a saccharide content much higher than the pig enzyme. This difference in saccharide contents is possibly related to the numbers of the N-linked glycosylation sites: 4 in the human and 2 in the pig enzymes. Therefore, we tried to prepare recombinant human dipeptidase with small saccharide contents in order to crystallize the enzyme. The crystals of the dipeptidase expressed in the baculovirus-infected silkworms were obtained initially. Though this protein exhibited a molecular mass of about 42 kDa, which is nearly identical to that for the trimmed dipept!dase, the crystals diffracted X-rays only up to 4 A resolution. Glycoproteins expressed in baculovirus systems sometimes exhibit heterogeneities in saccharide moieties, as is the case of rat acid phosphatase expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells: the enzyme showed 2

dimeric molecule are possibly related by the two-fold axis in the crystal. Under reducing conditions, the dipeptidase from the P. pastoris expression system showed several bands at about 45 kDa in SDS-PAGE and the saccharide-trimmed enzyme showed a single band at 42 kDa. The Crystals of the trimmed enzyme grew to mature sizes of 0.15 X 0.10 X 0.025 mm. Hence they were barely suited to X-ray diffraction experiments. The crystals often exhibited small cracks on the surfaces. When crystals without cracks were selected and seeded in the protein droplets, they grew to sizes of 0.5 × 0.3 X 0.1 mm. A photograph of the crystal grown with this macroseeding technique is shown in Fig. 1. The crystal of the trimmed dipeptidase diffracted Cu Kc~ X-rays up to 2.6 A resolution. When synchrotron X-rays were applied to the crystal, at BL14A of KEK Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan [19], diffraction spots were recorded up to 2.0 A. The crystal belongs to sl~ace group P21 with cell dimensions of a = 81.70 A, b = 81.74 A, c = 57.13 A and /3 = 96.45 °. Assuming that a dimer of 84 kDa exists in an asymmetric unit, the Vm value is estimated to be 2.26 A3/Da. This Vm value corresponds to the solvent content of 48% in crystal volume. The data

bands at 48 kDa and 46 kDa, while the enzyme treated with N-glycosidase showed a band at 41 kDa that is very close to the calculated mass of the polypeptide [21]. As the poor resolution of the dipeptidase from the baculovirus system seemed due to possible heterogeneity in saccharide moieties, we attempted to trim saccharide moieties off the dipeptidase expressed in large quantities from the P. pastris system. Among glycosidases we tested, only endoglycosidase Hf gave satisfactory results. Endoglycosidase Hf cleaves off saccharides at the downstream of N-linked N-acetylglucosamine, leaving only a single sugar group at each glycosylation site. The trimmed dipeptidase showed the molecular mass of 42 kDa, which is close to the calculated molecular mass of 41 068 Da for the dipeptidase polypeptide. The dipeptidase retained nearly full activity as well as moderate solubility suited to crystallization experiments. Therefore, trimming of oligosaccharides by the endoglycosidase Hf treatment is essential to obtaining diffraction-quality crystals. The crystallizations of the deglycosylated proteins have been reported on the Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase treated with a-mannosidase and endoglycosidase H [22] and on the amino-terminal half of human lactoferrin, which was produced from transfected baby hamster kidney cells and was treated with an endoglycosidase preparation [23]. The procedure we developed for the dipeptidase expressed in the P. pastoris system may be applicable to crystallizations of glycoproteins which exhibit high saccharide contents or heterogeneities. For the structure determination by the multiple isomorphous replacement method, diffraction data sets for 3 heavy-atom derivatives have been collected. Full elucidation of the dipeptidase structure by X-ray crystallography is in progress.
