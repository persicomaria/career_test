Abstract Reduced pteridines are required for a number of important cellular functions. Trypanosomatid parasites, unlike their mammalian hosts, are pteridine auxotrophs and salvage the precursor pteridines from the host and reduce them to the respective biologically active tetrahydro forms using parasite-encoded enzymes. These enzymes may oVer selective drug targets. In Leishmania, pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1), the primary enzyme for reducing pterins, is also responsible for resistance to antifolate drugs. Typically, PTR1 is more active with fully oxidized biopterin and folate than with their reduced counterparts. We have identiWed an enzyme, TcPTR2 of Trypanosoma cruzi, which though very similar to PTR1 in its primary sequence, can reduce only dihydrobiopterin and dihydrofolate and not oxidized pteridines. The structures of an inhibitor (methotrexate) and a substrate (dihydrofolate) complex of this enzyme demonstrate that the orientation of the substrate and the inhibitor in the active site of TcPTR2 are diVerent from each other. However, the orientation of each ligand is similar to that of the corresponding ligand in Leishmania major PTR1 complexes.  2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent for Chagas' disease or American Trypanosomiasis, which aVects 18­20 million people mostly in South and Central America and causes approximately 50,000 deaths annually. Approximately 100 million people in 21 countries are at risk. Currently available drugs are not eVective in the chronic stage of the disease and show severe side eVects (Urbina, 1999), and no vaccine is available. Although programs to control transmission at the vector level have been relatively successful in some

countries, eVective therapy is needed for millions of already infected persons. Understanding of essential metabolic pathways of the parasite is important for identiWcation of novel drug targets. Folate and other pterins (collectively referred to as pteridines) are required for a number of important biochemical reactions. Folates serve as cofactor in a number of one-carbon transfer reactions (e.g., biosynthesis of the nucleotide dTMP) (Decampo, 2001). Pterins play important role in aromatic amino acid hydroxylation (Kaufman and Kaufman, 1985; Kwon et al., 1989; Shiman, 1985), cleavage of ether-linked lipids and in nitric oxide biosynthesis in various organisms (Beck and Ullman, 1990; Marletta, 1993; Nichol et al., 1985; Trager, 1969). Although trypanosomatid parasites cannot synthesize pteridines, the absolute requirement for reduced pterins

by several trypanosomatid parasites has been established (Beck and Ullman, 1990; Cruz and Beverley, 1990; Cunningham and Beverley, 2001; Gourley et al., 2001; Oe et al., 1983; Winstanley, 2000). Therefore, these parasites depend on uptake of these molecules from their hosts. The precursor pterins (and folate) are reduced to the biologically active tetrahydro forms by parasite-encoded enzymes (Fig. 1). Bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) catalyzes the reduction of folate to 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) and subsequently to 5,6,7,8tetrahydrofolate (THF) (Beverley, 1991; Webber and Whiteley, 1985). Parasitic DHFR-TS enzymes show no activity with pterin substrates (Nare et al., 1997a; Smith et al., 1987; Zuccotto et al., 1998). On the other hand, pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1), catalyzes the reduction of conjugated and unconjugated pterins, but can also carry out reduction of folate to DHF and THF (Nare et al., 1997a). The ptr1 gene was originally identiWed as the gene responsible for resistance to the classical antifolate drug methotrexate (MTX) in Leishmania. In the presence of MTX, PTR1 is overexpressed, and since MTX is a relatively poor inhibitor of PTR1 (as compared to DHFR) and yet capable of reducing folate to DHF and THF, it provides a bypass for folate reduction in the presence of MTX (Nare et al., 1997a). Molecular and biochemical aspects of pteridine metabolism have been extensively studied in a number of Leishmania species (Chang et al., 1999; LeBlanc et al., 1998; Nare et al., 1997b; Papadopoulou et al., 1992), and recently the crystal structures of L. major PTR1 (Gourley et al., 2001) and L. tarentolae PTR1 (Zhao et al., 2003) have been determined. In contrast, the pteridine metabolic pathway in T. cruzi and related parasites is poorly understood. Robello et al. (1997) cloned the gene encoding T. cruzi PTR1 and showed that its overexpression enhanced resistance of the parasite towards MTX and other antifolate drugs. T. cruzi PTR1 is also relatively insensitive to MTX (Ki D 112 nM) (D. Chattopadhyay, unpublished).

Recently, we have expressed a recombinant T. cruzi enzyme (TcPTR2), which can reduce only dihydropteridines but not oxidized pteridines (Senkovich et al., 2003). The TcPTR2 protein diVers from the previously reported T. cruzi PTR1 (Robello et al., 1997) in only nine amino acid positions in the primary sequence. The enzyme, like PTR1, exists as a tetramer in solution and uses NADPH as a cofactor. It is even less susceptible to MTX (Ki D 5.5 M) than PTR1 (Chattopadhyay, unpublished). Here, we present crystal structures of two ternary complexes of T. cruzi PTR2 (PDB Ids: 1MXF, 1MXH).

2. Experimental Methods describing the expression, puriWcation, and crystallization of recombinant T. cruzi pteridine reductase (TcPTR2) have been reported (Schormann et al., 2001). Since no homologous model was available at the time, we determined the crystal structure using the MAD phasing technique. 2.1. Expression, puriWcation, and crystallization For expression of the selenomethionine-substituted enzyme (SeMet), the coding sequence for T. cruzi PTR2 was engineered into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET15b (Novagen) and the recombinant plasmid was then transformed into methionine auxotrophic strain B834pLysS of E. coli. The bacterial culture was grown in a selective medium (LeMasters) containing L-amino acids except methionine, which was substituted with L-selenomethionine (Sigma). The protein was puriWed by aYnity chromatography on a Ni­NTA superXow column (Qiagen), and subsequently by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia). Incorporation of selenomethionine (SeMet) was veriWed by mass spectrometry. A ternary complex of the

Both crystals belong to the same space group P31, and they were isomorphous. 2.2.

tion, and remote) for the SeMet PTR2 · NADPH · MTX complex were merged and scaled to 2.7 Å resolution keeping the Bijvoet pairs separated. These three data sets were used for structure solution. For subsequent reWnement of the structure of the MTX/NADPH complex we used the data set from the remote wavelength, which was processed as non-anomalous data to 2.3 Å resolution. For reWnement of the DHF/NADP+ complex we used a native data set scaled to 2.3 Å resolution. 2.3. Structure solution The structure of the MTX/NADPH complex was solved by MAD phasing using the program SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999). A plot of the selfrotation function showed a total of 12 peaks (at D 180° section) with a set of four peaks related by the crystallographic threefold symmetry. Moreover, the value of the Matthews coeYcient (for Nasu D 4: VM D 2.3, corresponding to 46% solvent) and packing considerations suggested the presence of a tetramer, related by noncrystallographic 222 symmetry, in the asymmetric unit (Schormann et al., 2001). Twelve Se positions (three for each monomer) were located and used in a multiple isomorphous replacement approach to provide phases to 2.7 Å (Table 1). The three non-crystallographic symmetry operators were determined using the program FINDNCS (Lu, 1999) with the 12 Se atoms as input. A combination of solvent Xattening and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging using program DM (Cowtan and Zhang, 1999) produced an interpretable map. Using data from the remote wavelength experimental phases were extended to 2.3 Å resolution for calculation of an experimental density map. Phasing statistics are shown in Table 1. 2.4. Structure reWnement An initial model containing about 60% of all residues for the MTX/NADPH complex was obtained by automated interpretation of the density map and model building at 2.3 Å resolution combined with reWnement using the ARP/wARP program package (Perrakis et al., 1999). Several rounds of manual model building for a monomeric unit using QUANTA (Accelrys) were followed by intermittent reWnement cycles against the remote wavelength data using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) until the initial model was about 85% complete. In the initial cycles of reWnement strict non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) was employed. Alternate cycles of rebuilding, positional reWnement, simulated annealing, and B factor reWnement were performed until both the R and Rfree values were about 30%. At this stage, the cofactor NADPH and the inhibitor MTX were Wtted into diVerence electron density maps and a tetramer was created by application of non-crystallographic symmetry

followed by alternate cycles of rebuilding, positional reWnement, B factor reWnement, and water placement. A Xat bulk-solvent model and NCS restraints were used until the R factor converged at about 22.9%. No special restraints for the cofactor and inhibitor were imposed during reWnement. In a Wnal round of positional reWnement and B factor reWnement we released the NCS restraints and reWned the four monomers in the asymmetric unit independently to an R factor of 20.4% (Rfree of 24.7%) at 2.3 Å resolution. The r.m.s. (root mean square) deviation for all atoms between individual monomers is 0.2­0.3 Å. The structure of the DHF (substrate) complex was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) with coordinates from the MTX/NADPH complex as a search model. ReWnement of this structure proceeded in similar fashion as described above to a Wnal R factor of 20.0% (Rfree of 25.2%) at 2.3 Å resolution. No special restraints for the cofactor and substrate were imposed during reWnement. ReWnement statistics are shown in Table 2. Coordinates and structure factors for TcPTR2 have been deposited with PDB (PDB entries: 1MXF, r1mxfsf.ent; 1MXH, r1mxhsf.ent). Sequences for T. cruzi PTR2 from Sylvio and Y strains were deposited with GenBank (AAO18339; AAN62582). It should be noted that the sequence of the TcPTR2 protein used for crystallization (see Fig. 2) diVers from GenBank sequence AAO18339 at three positions (15, 121, and 248). It is not clear if these changes are due to strain variability or errors introduced during PCR ampliWcation of the coding sequence.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Quality of the structures The structure of the ternary complexes with NADPH and MTX as well as with NADP+ and DHF were reWned to a resolution of 2.3 Å (Table 2). These complexes will be referred to as MTX and DHF complex, respectively. The N-terminal 20 residues encoded by the expression vector were not visible in either structure. In addition, protein residues 1­10 and residues in two loop regions (113­122 and 152­160 in the MTX complex; 113­123 and 152­158 in the DHF complex) are missing from the Wnal models. For the MTX and DHF complexes, the Ramachandran plot shows 88.7 and 87.1% of the residues in the most favored region, as well as 10.8 and 12.4% in the additionally allowed regions. One amino acid residue (Arg22) in each monomer lies in the generously allowed region in both structures. This residue adopts a more unusual rotamer conformation, presumably because of its critical role as a contact residue to both cofactor and substrate/inhibitor. A similar conformation for the corresponding arginine residue is seen in the structures of other pteridine reductase enzymes

The one-letter codes are colored red for charged, light blue for polar, and black for hydrophobic residues. Conserved residues are shaded in gray. The boxed residues show the diVerence between TcPTRl and TcPTR2. The labeled secondary structure elements are as observed in the two TcPTR2 structures (see also Fig. 3A ). The active site triad residues are also labeled. Colored rectangles above the sequences mark important structural residues: residues binding the cofactor NADPH are in lavender, residues binding the inhibitor MTX are in green, residues binding both are in cyan, the active site residues of the catalytic triad are boxed and in gold, and residues with missing electron density are dashed in black.

(Gourley et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2003). The overall quality of the present structures is comparable to the other pteridine reductase structures (1E92, 1E7W, 1P33, and 1W0C). SIGMAA plots (Read, 1986) indicate an overall error in atomic coordinates of 0.27 Å for the inhibitor complex and 0.26 Å for the substrate complex. The average B factors for all atoms are 36.3 and 39.4 Å2 for the MTX and DHF complex, respectively. Excellent electron density was noticeable for the MTX and cofactor molecules, as well as for a number of water molecules at or near the active site (see Fig. 6). 3.2. Topology of monomer and organization of the tetramer Each monomer in TcPTR2 folds into a single / domain and maintains typical SDR topology, consisting of a seven-stranded parallel -sheet and seven -helices, with three helices on each side of the sheet (Fig. 3A ). Each subunit is equipped with its own binding sites for both cofactor and substrate/inhibitor. However, the

functional enzyme is a tetramer in solution, and in the crystal structure the subunits forming the tetramer are related by 222 point-group symmetry (Schormann et al., 2001). Tetramer formation extends the sheet structure with the two seven-stranded parallel sheets being antiparallel to each other (interface between subunits A and C, as well as B and D). The other major contact area between monomeric subunits is conWned to -helices 4 and 5 (interface between subunits A and B, as well as C and D). Helices 4 and 5 from one subunit together with corresponding helices from the other subunit form a four-helix cluster at the interface. This spatial arrangement positions the active sites at a distance of 30­35 Å from each other. The active sites of monomers A and D are on one side, the active sites of monomers B and C on the other side of the tetramer (Fig. 3B ). As observed in L. major PTR1 (Gourley et al., 2001), the C-terminus of one subunit is positioned between the loop linking 5­ 5 and the C-terminus of the partner subunit, bringing the side chain of Arg275 close to the active site of the partner subunit.

TcPTR1 and TcPTR2 showed a total of nine diVerences (Fig. 2). Two of these amino acid changes occur in a loop region, which is not visible in the electron density of our structure(s). Mapping of the remaining residues onto the tertiary structure(s) reveals that neither of these residues is close to the active site, but four amino acid changes occur at two of the subunit interfaces (residue 137: subunit interface A­B and C­D; residues 248, 259, and 263: subunit interface A­C and B­ D). The implication of these diVerences remains

unknown until the three-dimensional structure of T. cruzi PTR1 is available. Alignment of primary sequences for pteridine reductase from four species of kinetoplasts shows a high degree of homology (Fig. 2). The Leishmania sequences demonstrate highest homology (80% identity and 91% similarity between LmPTR1 and LtPTR1), followed by the Trypanosoma sequences (58% identity and 77% similarity between TcPTR2 and T. brucei PTR1), while the homology between Leishmania and Trypanosoma sequences is lower (47­48%

identity and 67­70% similarity). Comparison of crystal structures of the inhibitor complexes for L. major, L. tarentolae, and T. cruzi pteridine reductase show an r.m.s. deviation of 0.6 Å for 240 C atoms (LmPTR1 vs. TcPTR2) and 0.5 Å for 241 C atoms (LtPTR1 vs. TcPTR2), while the corresponding substrate complexes of LmPTR1 and TcPTR2 show an r.m.s. deviation of 0.7 Å for 243 C atoms.

The NADPH molecule is held in place via an extensive network of

hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with the protein (Fig. 4). There are also extensive interactions between the pterin moiety of MTX and the nicotinamide ribose and the pyrophosphate moiety of the cofactor. This provides an explanation for the sequential binding mode where NADPH must bind Wrst. The substrate/ inhibitor can only bind eVectively after the PTR2 · NADPH complex is formed. Once the substrate/ inhibitor is bound the active site is virtually closed leaving little room for the departure of the oxidized cofactor. At the completion of the reaction, the product must leave the active site before NADP+ can leave. Since both the oxidized (NADP+) and the reduced (NADPH) cofactor form extensive contacts with the protein in a very similar fashion, it is not clear how the newly formed NADP+ is released to make room for binding another NADPH molecule for initiating a new round of reduction. The relatively low turnover rate of the enzyme may result from an ineYcient release of NADP+. The cofactor NADPH shows an extended conformation. The nicotinamide ribose, as well as the adenosine ribose adopts a C2 -endo pucker conformation. The conWgurations of the nicotinamide and the adenine ring are syn and anti to their respective sugar moieties. The interaction between pteridine reductase and NADPH diVers from other short chain dehydrogenases (SDRs)

(Oppermann et al., 2003). The coenzyme-binding motif GXXXGXG is replaced by G18XXXR22XG24 in the T. cruzi enzyme sequence. This motif is characteristic for all pteridine reductases. In SDRs, speciWcity for NADPH over NADH is established by the side chains of two basic residues that interact directly with the 2 -phosphate of NADPH. In TcPTR2, Arg21 and Arg43 represent these conserved basic residues. In our structures, Arg21, Arg43, His44, and Ser45 create a 2 -phosphate binding pocket and establish interactions with the 2 (ribose) phosphate group. Side-chain interactions to the 2 -phosphate group occur only with residues Arg21 and Ser45 whereas residues Arg43 and His44 display only main-chain interactions and Ser45 is involved in mainchain interactions in addition to side-chain interactions. In contrast, in L. major PTR1 the corresponding residues are Lys16, His38, Arg39, and Ser40, and only the main-chain atoms of residues His38, Arg39, and Ser40 interact with the 2 -phosphate (Gourley et al., 2001). The catalytic site contains several crucial water molecules (W62, W79, W110, and W247) that bridge residues Ala20, Glu131, Ser103, and the cofactor. The amide group of the nicotinamide ring is hydrogen-bonded to residues Ser215 and Leu216. The pyrophosphate moiety shows interactions with side-chain atoms NE and NH2 of Arg22. No direct interactions are observed between

the adenine ring of NADPH and the enzyme surface, although there is a hydrogen bond to a water molecule (W110), which connects to side-chain atoms of Arg43 and Glu131. The interactions between protein, cofactor and inhibitor occur mainly through the pteridine ring. A stacking interaction is observed between Tyr105 and the pteridine ring of the inhibitor (Fig. 5). In addition, the pteridine ring is stacked on the opposite side against the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor. All nitrogen atoms except N5 in the pteridine ring participate in electrostatic interactions with the nicotinamide ribose and the pyrophosphate moiety of the cofactor, protein residues Tyr182 (side-chain), Ser103 (side-chain and main-chain) and Arg22 (through a

bridging water molecule). Interactions between the protein and the remaining atoms of the inhibitor are limited to a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Tyr229 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the p-aminobenzoyl group of MTX. In contrast, in DHFR, essentially all atoms of MTX take part in protein­ ligand interactions resulting in a more eYcient binding of MTX in the DHFR active site (Li et al., 2000). In the active site of TcPTR2, the pteridine ring of MTX shows a diVerent orientation (rotation about the N2­ N5 axis by 180 °) relative to that observed for DHF (Fig. 5). Similar orientations are observed for MTX and folate in their complexes with DHFR (Davies et al., 1990). The diVerence in the binding mode of

MTX compared to DHF (which results from the substitution of the 4-keto group by an amino group) can be exploited for development of antifolate substrate analogs based on the 2,4-diaminopteridine scaVold. Structure­activity studies based on a similar strategy have been reported for L. major PTR1 (Hardy et al., 1997; McLuskey et al., 2004) and T. cruzi PTR2 (Schormann et al., 2003). 3.4. Active site interactions in ternary substrate (DHF) complex The oxidized cofactor NADP+ shows an extended conformation similar to NADPH in the MTX complex. The nicotinamide ribose adopts a C3 -endo, and the adenosine ribose a C2 -endo pucker. NADP+ shows similar interactions with the protein as observed for NADPH. One diVerence is the loss of a direct contact to Arg21. In addition to the electrostatic interactions with Arg22 and the N2 atom of DHF, the pyrophosphate moiety of NADP+ also displays a contact to Arg21 through a bridging water molecule (W200). The nicotinamide ring is also hydrogen-bonded to mainchain atoms of Ser215 and Leu216. The adenine ring of NADP+ forms a direct contact through N6 with sidechain atoms of Ser72 and Glu131. Arg22 donates hydrogen bonds to the pyrophosphate of NADP+ and to O4 of DHF. The nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the pteridine ring of DHF make a number of contacts with the protein: O4 of the pteridine ring with side-chain atoms of Arg22, N8 with the hydroxyl group of Tyr182, N2 with the hydroxyl group of Ser103. In addition, the N1 atom of the substrate makes contact with the nicotinamide ribose, and N2 as well as N3 with the pyrophosphate moiety of the oxidized cofactor. A similar binding mode was noted for DHB in its complex of L. major PTR1 (Gourley et al., 2001). One notable diVerence in this DHF complex is the weak electrostatic interaction between the nicotinamide ring and N5 of the pteridine ring. In the present structure, Leu216 contacts O4 and N5 of the pteridine ring through a bridging water molecule (W455). The remaining atoms of the substrate are not well deWned and there is only one notable electrostatic interaction between the carbonyl oxygen of the p-aminobenzoyl group with the hydroxyl group of Tyr229. In human DHFR (Davies et al., 1990), the carbonyl oxygen atom of the p-aminobenzoyl group and the carboxyl oxygens of the glutamate tail of folate are hydrogen-bonded to basic residues and water molecules. 3.5. Catalytic triad and reaction mechanism The catalytic triad of T. cruzi pteridine reductase is made up of Tyr182, Lys186, and Asp169. In all pteridine reductases, aspartate replaces the normally

observed serine in the active site of SDRs. The sidechain of Tyr182 forms hydrogen bonds to the pterin N8 atom of DHF and to the side-chain of Asp169. The side-chain of Lys186 displays electrostatic interactions only with the nicotinamide ribose but not the hydroxyl group of Tyr182 (distance 4.5 Å). In the mechanism suggested by Gourley et al. (2001), the protonated aspartyl residue participates in the reduction of oxidized pterins. The decrease in activity at higher pH would then likely correspond to deprotonation of the solvent accessible aspartyl residue. According to the proposed reaction mechanism, the active site tyrosine (Tyr182) forms a hydrogen bond to the N8 atom of the substrate and provides the proton for the Wrst reduction. In the DHF complex, Tyr182 is at an appropriate distance for proton transfer. The reason for the incompetence of TcPTR2 to catalyze the Wrst reduction step cannot be explained on the basis of these structures. There are nine amino acid diVerences between TcPTR1 and TcPTR2 distributed over the entire 276 residues. All residues proposed to be directly involved in the Wrst and second reduction steps catalyzed by PTR1 are conserved between TcPTR1 and TcPTR2. Two of the nine variant residues could not be located in the electron density map of TcPTR2 presumably because of high thermal motion. Several variant residues are at the surface of the protein and some at the intermolecular interfaces. Amino acid residues, which are located outside of the active site can change the geometry of the active site and inXuence substrate binding and/or enzyme activity. An example of this is found in human Cu­Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD). Eleven unique mutations at nine distinct sites of SOD are associated with amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease. These mutations lie outside the active site but produce slight distortions in the elements of the secondary structure of the protein and aVect its ligand binding and enzymatic activity (Deng et al., 1993). It is not known at the present time if the lack of activity with fully oxidized pterins for PTR2 arises from its inability to bind the fully oxidized substrate or due to the lack of capacity to transfer the proton.
