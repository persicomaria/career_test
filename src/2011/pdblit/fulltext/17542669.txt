Objective: To analyze interactions between the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) and a thyroidstimulating human monoclonal autoantibody (M22) at the molecular level. Design: A complex of part of the TSHR extracellular domain (amino acids 1­260; TSHR260) bound to M22 Fab was prepared and purified. Crystals ° suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained and the structure solved at 2.55 A resolution. Main outcome: TSHR260 comprises of a curved helical tube and M22 Fab clasps its concave surface at 908 to the tube length axis. ° The interface buried in the complex is large (2500 A2) and an extensive network of ionic, polar, and hydrophobic bonding is involved in the interaction. There is virtually no movement in the atoms of M22 residues on the binding interface compared to unbound M22 consistent with ``lock and key'' binding. Mutation of residues showing strong interactions in the structure influenced M22 activity, indicating that the binding detail observed in the complex reflects interactions of M22 with intact, functionally active TSHR. The receptor-binding arrangements of the autoantibody are very similar to those reported for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) binding to the FSH receptor (amino acids 1­268) and consequently to those of TSH itself. Conclusions: It is remarkable that the thyroid-stimulating autoantibody shows almost identical receptor-binding features to TSH although the structures and origins of these two ligands are very different. Furthermore, our structure of the TSHR and its complex with M22 provide foundations for developing new strategies to understand and control both glycoprotein hormone receptor activation and the autoimmune response to the TSHR.

Introduction utoantibodies to the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) are responsible for thyroid overactivity in Graves' disease (1), a condition that affects about 1 in 50 females worldwide (2). The autoantibodies bind to the TSHR in such a way as to mimic the action of TSH thereby stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis (1). The TSHR, along with the receptors for luteinizing hormone and for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), belongs to a subfamily of G protein­coupled receptors characterized by a large, extracellular, leucine-rich repeat domain (LRD) which has an important role in hormone binding (3). Recently, the binding arrangements between FSH and part of the FSH receptor (FSHR) LRD (amino acids 1­268) have been defined by X-ray analysis and comparative modeling studies indicate that TSH interacts with the TSHR LRD in a similar manner (3­5).

A

We have isolated a human monoclonal autoantibody to the TSHR (M22), which is a powerful thyroid stimulator with high affinity for the receptor, and determined its crystal ° structure at 1.65 A resolution (6,7). The availability of M22 has enabled us to prepare, purify, and crystallize a complex of M22 and part of the TSHR LRD suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis, thus providing a unique opportunity to study the interactions between the autoantibody and its target receptor at the molecular level. Materials and Methods Expression of TSHR260 in insect cells A TSHR260 construct (coding for amino acids 1­260 of the human TSHR) was amplified using full-length human TSHR (764 amino acids) (4) as template (8) with 50 -CACTGCAGG ATCCAAATGAGGCCGGCGGACTTG-30 and 50 -CAGTCCT CTAGATTATCAGTGATGGTGGTGGTGATGGTTAAGAG

396 TCCAGGTGTTTCTTGCTAT-30 primers (Sigma Genosys, Cambridge, UK) which added a BamHI restriction site to the N terminus and also a one amino acid linker (asparagine), a six-histidine tag, stop codon, and an XbaI restriction site to the C terminus. TSHR260 was cloned into pFastbac1 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) using BamHI and XbaI restriction sites and the DNA sequence was verified using the Sanger­Coulson method (9). Recombinant Bacmid DNA was made using the Bac to Bac Baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant plasmid DNA was prepared using a plasmid midi kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and the presence of TSHR260 DNA in the recombinant Bacmid was confirmed by PCR. Recombinant Bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf-9 insect cells (Invitrogen), which were grown in TC100 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v=v) fetal calf serum and 7 mg=mL gentamycin, to obtain and amplify recombinant baculovirus stock. All virus stocks were titered using a BacPAK baculovirus rapid titer kit (BD Clontech, Cowley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of purified M22 IgG and Fab M22 IgG was prepared from heterohybridoma culture supernatants using protein A affinity chromatography on MabSelectÔ (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK). The purified IgG was treated with mercuripapain (Sigma, Poole, UK) at an enzyme=protein ratio of 1:50 and passed through a MabSelectÔ column to remove any intact IgG or Fc from the Fab preparation as described before (7). M22 Fab was analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (10) under reducing conditions to assess purity and biological activity tested in adenasine 30 ,50 cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) stimulation assays using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that express the TSHR (7). In addition, the ability of M22 Fab to inhibit 125I-TSH or 125 I-M22 binding to TSHR-coated tubes was assessed (11,12). Preparation of the TSHR260­M22 Fab complex High FiveÔ insect cells (BTI-TN-5B1-4 from Invitrogen) were maintained in ExCell 400 medium (SAFC Biosciences, Basingstoke, UK) supplemented with 0.1 mmol=L KI and 7 mg=mL gentamycin at 228C in 500 mL spinner flasks (Barloworld Scientific, Stone, UK), stirring at 60 rpm with ventilation. Each flask was seeded at a cell density of 0.5Â106 cells=mL and incubated for 24 hours at 228C before infecting with baculovirus stock at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0006 pfu=cell. Incubation of cell cultures was continued, and purified M22 Fab was added 96 hours postinfection to a final concentration of 2 mg=mL. Culture supernatants containing TSHR260­M22 Fab complex were harvested 120 hours post infection by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 minutes. One tablet of Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) was added per 200 mL of supernatant, before storing at À 708C until purification. Purification of the TSHR260­M22 Fab complex Culture supernatant containing the TSHR260­M22 Fab complexes was adjusted to pH 6.2 with 500 mmol=L sodium phosphate (NaH2PO4) and loaded onto 75 mL of Streamline

SANDERS ET AL. Direct HST matrix in a Streamline 25 expanded bed chromatography system (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 50 mmol=L NaH2PO4 (pH 6.0) and 50 mmol=L sodium chloride (NaCl), followed by 100 mmol=L NaCl and 50 mmol=L Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), and eluted with 100 mmol=L NaCl and 50 mmol=L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The presence of the TSHR260­M22 complex in the eluted fractions was confirmed by Western blotting analysis using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1 mg=mL) reactive with a TSHR epitope within amino acids 246­260 (TSHR MAb 18C5) (13). The TSHR260­M22 Fab complex was further purified by affinity chromatography using a mouse monoclonal antibody (TSHR MAb 14C4) (13) that binds to a conformational epitope within amino acids 22­261 of the TSHR extracellular domain, which was coupled to CNBr-activated sepharose-4B (Sigma). In particular, the complex was loaded onto a 4 mL MAb 14C4 affinity column, washed with 100 mmol=L NaCl and 50 mmol=L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), eluted with 100 mmol=L NaCl and 100 mmol=L citrate (pH 4.0), and collected into an equal volume of neutralization buffer (0.5 mol=L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) followed by dialysis into 50 mmol=L NaCl and 10 mmol=L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The dialyzed complex was then further purified using nickel affinity chromatography in which the complex was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen), washed with wash buffer (50 mmol=L NaCl and 10 mmol=L TrisHCl, pH 8.0), and eluted with 20 mmol=L midazole in wash buffer. The eluted complex was then dialyzed into 50 mmol=L NaCl and 10 mmol=L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and used to set up deglycosylation reactions. The concentration of the complex was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm on the basis that 1 absorbance unit was equivalent to 0.69 mg= mL of TSHR260­M22 Fab (the extinction coefficient was obtained using ProtParam tool in ExPASY Proteomics Server, http:= =www.expasy.org=tools=protparam.html). Deglycosylation of the TSHR260­M22 Fab complex and final purification The purified complex was deglycosylated using Endoglycosidase F3 (Sigma) at an enzyme-to-complex ratio of 152 mU of enzyme per mg of complex in 50 mmol=L sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) at 208C for 5 days. The deglycosylation reactions were then adjusted to pH 6.5 using 200 mmol=L TrisHCl, run onto a cation exchange High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Bioassist S column (Tosoh), and eluted using a pH gradient from pH 6.5 to pH 9.0. The eluted, purified complex was then concentrated to approximately 32 mg=mL using a Microcon YM-10 concentrator (Millipore, Watford, UK), analyzed by gel filtration using an HPLC TSK-GEL G3000SW column (Tosoh) to check integrity and purity, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assess purity further. The purified complex was then used for crystallization screening trials immediately or stored at À 208C in aliquots. Protein sequencing of TSHR260 Purified TSHR260­M22 Fab complex (30 mg) was run on 12% SDS-PAGE (under non-reducing conditions) followed by blotting onto Immobilon PSQ transfer membrane (Millipore) in 10 mmol=L 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPS) (pH 11) and 10% methanol. The membrane was stained with Coomassie blue, the band representing TSHR260

TSH RECEPTOR CRYSTAL STRUCTURE was excised, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence was analyzed (Alta Biosciences, Birmingham, UK). Amino acid mutations in the M22 heavy chain or light chain The M22 heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) sequences with C-terminal six-histidine tags were cloned into vectors derived from pUC18 as described previously (7). Specific ``forward'' and ``reverse'' PCR primers (Sigma Genosys) were designed for each mutation to change the nucleotide coding sequence of either the HC or LC to code for the appropriate amino acid mutation. Wild-type (WT) or mutated M22 HC genes were cloned into XhoI and SpeI restriction sites of Immunozap H=L vector (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, Netherlands), and WT or mutated M22 LC genes were cloned into SacI and XbaI restriction sites of the same vector. The presence of the mutations was verified using sequencing by the Sanger­Coulson method (9). Plasmid DNA containing the M22 HC and LC gene sequences was transformed into HB2151 cells (GE Healthcare) and expression of recombinant M22 Fab in the cultures was induced with isopropyl-b-D thiogalactoside (final concentration of 1 mmol=L) in the presence of 0.3 mol=L sucrose. Expression of recombinant Fab was verified by Western blotting using Fab-specific anti-human IgG antibody (Sigma) and 10 ng of WT recombinant M22 Fab was detectable in this system. Recombinant M22 Fab preparations were then purified on a Streamline Direct HST column (GE Healthcare) followed by Ni-NTA agarose chromatography. Purity of the eluted Fabs was >95% as assessed by SDS-PAGE (10) and Fab concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm on the basis that 1 absorbance unit was equivalent to 0.7 mg=mL of Fab. Amino acid mutations in the TSHR sequence The method used to introduce specific mutations into the TSHR sequence was as described in detail previously (14). All PCR primers for introducing mutations were made by Sigma Genosys and the presence of the mutation was verified using sequencing by the Sanger­Coulson method (9). The Flp-In system (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of WT and mutated TSHR cDNAs into CHO cells as described previously (14). Effect of mutations in the TSHR or in M22 on M22 biological activity The activity of WT or mutated recombinant M22 Fab preparations was assessed by their ability to stimulate cyclic AMP production in CHO cells transfected with WT or mutated TSHR (14). The expression and function of mutated TSHRs was checked by their ability to respond to TSH (14). In addition, 125I-labeled WT M22 Fab binding to mutated TSHR preparations was assessed (14). Crystallization and diffraction data collection Partially deglycosylated TSHR­M22 Fab complex (see ``Results'' and ``Discussion'' sections for details of deglycosylation) at a concentration of 32.8 mg=mL was used for vapordiffusion hanging-drop crystallization experiments. Clusters

397 of small crystals appeared after about 2 weeks in Wizard Crystal Screen I, condition #46 (Emerald BioStructures, Bainbridge Island, WA). The crystallization solution was then optimized to 8% PEG 8000, 0.1 mol=L 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) (pH 6.0), and 0.25 mol=L zinc acetate, which resulted in bigger crystals but still growing in clusters. A single crystal with dimensions 0.02Â0.02Â 0.05 mm was manually separated from a cluster and flashcooled in liquid nitrogen in the presence of 26% ethylene glycol as cryo-protectant agent. X-ray diffraction data collection experiments with this crystal were performed at 100 K using an ``in-house'' copperrotating anode radiation source (generator RU-H3R, RigakuMSC, Sevenoaks, UK, equipped with Max-Flux confocal multilayer optics, Osmic, Rigaku-MSC group, Sevenoaks, UK). The diffraction data were recorded using a Raxis IVþþ image plate detector (Rigaku-MSC). Raw diffraction data were collected using the single crystal at one-degree oscillation steps (a total of 129 degrees were collected) and were indexed, integrated, scaled, and reduced using HKL diffraction data processing suite (15). The crystal belonged to the orthorhombic I212121 space group, had one TSHR­M22 Fab complex in the asymmetric unit (54% solvent content), and diffracted to ° 3.1 A Bragg's spacing. Subsequently, a second round of crystallization experiments was set up using a different batch of purified TSHR260­M22 Fab complex (at 32 mg=mL) and crystals were obtained with the same crystallization conditions as the first series of experiments. X-ray diffraction data collection was then carried out using a synchrotron radiation source (station PX14.2, Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils, Daresbury, UK). The data were collected from a single crystal at ° 100 K and the resolution of diffraction was improved to 2.55 A ° Bragg's spacing. The initial structure obtained at 3.1 A reso° lution was then refined using the newly acquired 2.55 A resolution data and the analysis presented here refers to analysis ° of the structure solved at 2.55 A. Results TSHR260­M22 Fab complex The TSHR260­M22 Fab complex that formed in the insect cell culture media remained stable throughout three rounds of column chromatography, deglycosylation with Endoglycosidase F3, and final purification by cation exchange chromatography. In particular, analysis of purified deglycosylated TSHR260­M22 complex by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions indicated that the complex resolved into its two components, that is, TSHR260 (37 kDa) and M22 Fab (54 kDa), in approximately equal proportions (Fig. 1A). As shown in Figure 1A, a small proportion of M22 Fab after incubation with glycosidase (lanes 2­4) ran on SDS-PAGE with the same relative mobility as untreated M22 Fab (lane 1), suggesting that not all M22 Fab in the complex was deglycosylated. Only a small amount of free M22 Fab (approximately 7%) was present in the purified deglycosylated TSHR260­M22 Fab complex as assessed by analysis on HPLC gel filtration (Fig. 1B, C). Analysis of the N-terminal amino acids of the protein band at molecular weight approximately 40 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1) revealed the following sequence: Met-Gly-X-Ser-Ser-Pro. The X is likely to be Cys. This corresponds to the sequence of human TSHR between amino

The positions of molecular weight markers are also shown, and the positions of M22 Fab and TSHR260 before and after deglycosylation are marked (lane 1: purified TSHR260­M22 Fab before deglycosylation; lane 2: the complex after deglycosylation and before final purification by cation exchange HPLC; lane 3: the complex after deglycosylation and purification by cation exchange; lane 4: deglycosylated, purified, and concentrated complex [as used for crystallization trials]). As shown in the figure, M22 Fab in the complex was partially deglycosylated. Approximately 10 mg of TSHR260­M22 Fab was loaded per lane in lanes 1, 2, and 4, and approximately 5 mg in lane 3. (B) Analysis of purified TSHR260­M22 Fab complex before deglycosylation by gel filtration HPLC (TSK-GEL G3000SW run in 150 mmol=L NaCl, 10 mmol=L Tris pH 7.0; fraction volume 0.5 mL) (peak 1: TSHR260­M22 Fab complex; peak 2: M22 Fab alone superimposed from a run carried out separately).

acids 22 and 27, that is, Met-Gly-Cys-Ser-Ser-Pro, and is consistent with the expressed sequence starting with residue 22 (residues 1­21 are the signal peptide) (16). Consequently, the identity of TSHR260 in our purified complex was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Crystallization of TSHR260­M22 Fab complex, structure determination, and refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement; M22 Fab (7) and the FSHR (3) crystal structures being used as search models and calculations were done in AMoRe (17). The M22 Fab search probe was further split into two: one containing only variable domains and the other, constant domains. The positions of TSHR and variable domains of M22 Fab within the asymmetric unit were successfully obtained, resulting in an R-factor of 48.2%. However, no solution could be identified for the constant domains; these were subsequently placed manually using electron density maps calculated after a preliminary refinement round. The resulting model, prior to the refinement, had an R-factor of 43.5% and Rfree of 45.5%. A total of eight rounds of crystallogra-

phic refinement and manual rebuilding were performed. The structure was refined using CNS (18) and REFMAC (19) in the final stages. Manual rebuilding was performed in Coot (20) using sigmaA weighted 2Fo À Fc, Fo À Fc, and annealed omit maps. The Zn2þ ions, N-acetylglucosamine residues, and water molecules were placed only in the last refinement=rebuilding rounds. The model of the complex structure ° solved at 3.1 A resolution was then refined again using dif° fraction data at 2.55 A resolution to an R-factor of 18.1% (Rfree ¼ 24.5%). The refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The final structure consists of M22 LC (residues 1­208), HC (residues 1­127 and 134­213), TSHR (residues 30­257), six N-acetylglucosamine residues, five zinc ions, and 289 water molecules. Continuous electron density was observed for the first sugar unit (N-acetylglucosamine) at all N-linked glycosylation sites on the TSHR (N77, N99, N113, N177, and N198) and the one site on M22 (LC N26). There was no electron density for the loop residues of M22 HC 128­133 and some terminal residues (M22 Fab LC 209­212, M22 Fab HC 214­220, TSHR residues 22­29 and 258­260, and the C-terminal hexa-histidines) due to disorder. Side-chain atoms of TSHR E35 were lacking clear electron density and there-

399 residues in each of the 10 parallel b strands of the concave surface number are 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 5, 6, 3, and 3. There is an additional b strand lying antiparallel to the others before the first repeat, which forms a b hairpin (Fig. 2). The structure of the convex surface of the TSHR LRD presents eight small strands (two residues each) forming two 3-stranded b sheets and one 2-stranded b sheet (Fig. 2). There are no a helices in the TSHR LRD structure. All five (N77, N99, N113, N177, and N198) glycosylation sites are located on the convex surface of the TSHR LRD. The N-terminal cysteines (C31 and C41) in the TSHR sequence are disulfide bonded. Interactions in TSHR260­M22 Fab complex The structure of TSHR260­M22 Fab shows M22 Fab bound to the concave surface of TSHR260 with the appearance of an approximate pseudo dyad axis of symmetry perpendicular to the TSHR ``tube'' and lying nearly parallel to the interface between the LC and HC of M22 (Figs. 2 and 3). The majority of the residues located on the binding interface of the antibody variable regions of M22 when bound to the TSHR have almost identical positions compared to those in ° unbound M22 (rmsd of all atoms 0.4 A). The highest devia° tion of an atom from M22 backbone residues is only 1.1 A, observed for the Ca atom of HC P97. In addition, only six M22 residues present a deviation of their side chains com° pared to unbound M22 greater than 2 A. The overall position of M22 Fab constant region domains differs from that seen in unbound M22 Fab by about 208 of rotation around the axis between the constant and variable domains due to the packing of the molecules in the crystal. None of the glycosylation sites on the TSHR (all present on the convex surface of the TSHR tube) interfere with M22 Fab binding and are distant from the binding interface. ° A total of 2,500 A2 of solvent-accessible surface area is buried in the autoantibody­receptor interface. The interactions between TSHR260 and M22 are a mixture of an extensive hydrogen bonding and salt bridge network (22 hydrogen bonds and salt bridges), non-hydrogen bonding polar interactions and hydrophobic contacts (Table 2; Fig. 4). The HC of M22 has more residues interacting with the TSHR than the LC although both form a number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (14 for the HC and 8 for the LC) (Table 2; Fig. 4). The majority of the interacting residues of M22 are located in the hypervariable regions L2, H2, and H3 (Fig. 3E). The surface buried in the interface between TSHR260 and M22 LC is ° ° 526.9 A2 for TSHR260 and 526.5 A2 for M22 LC, whereas for the interaction between TSHR260 and M22 HC, the area is ° ° 730.1 A2 for TSHR260 and 730.4 A2 for M22 HC. TSHR260 forms seven hydrogen bonds with M22 LC and seven hydrogen bonds with M22 HC (Table 2). In particular, M22 HC Y99 is hydrogen bonded with two TSHR residues: E107 (involving the backbone nitrogen of M22 Y99 and the side chain of TSHR E107) and K58 (involving the side chains of both residues). Also M22 LC Q53 produces two hydrogen bonds (with TSHR N208 and Q235). TSHR K129 produces three hydrogen bonds involving M22 HC T30 and T53, while TSHR Q235 is hydrogen bonded to two M22 residues (LC D52 and LC Q53). The TSHR260­M22 Fab interactions also include 14 water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Table 2). In addition, some TSHR260 residues are involved in strong van der Waals interactions with M22, in particular R255 with an interaction

Structure of the TSHR LRD The TSHR has the shape of a slightly curved helical tube constructed from leucine-rich repeat motifs. It has opposed concave and convex surfaces, with a 10-stranded b sheet located on the concave surface (Fig. 2). The inner surface of the tube is lined with hydrophobic residues. The closest homologue of the TSHR is the FSHR with which it shares 40.9% sequence identity (3,16); the root mean square deviation ° (rmsd) on Ca core atoms between the structures is 1.1 A. Like that of the FSHR (3), the concave surface of the TSHR LRD is formed from an untwisted b-sheet whilst the convex surface has less regular but mainly extended return strands. The

M22 residues involved in van der Waals interactions with TSHR260 with large interaction surface areas include residues in both ° the HCs and the LCs: for example, M22 HC R28 (116 A2) and ° M22 LC Y50 (86 A2) (Table 3B). The electrostatic surface potential of the TSHR260 concave surface and the M22 antigen-binding surface are polarized in terms of charge distribution. In particular, the N-terminal part of the concave surface of the TSHR tube is predominantly positively charged whereas the C-terminal part is predominantly negatively charged (Fig. 3D). The surface distribution of charged residues on M22 is complementary to that on TSHR260 with the negatively charged surface of M22 combining with the positively charged N-terminal part of TSHR260 and the positively charged surface of M22 combining with the negatively charged C-terminal end of TSHR260 (Fig. 3D). There are a number of electrostatic interactions in

the TSHR260­M22 complex (shown using interaction strength greater than 6.0e-10 N as a cutoff) and these are detailed in Table 4. TSHR R80 produces the strongest accumulated electrostatic interactions with M22 whereas M22 HC R28 produces the strongest accumulated electrostatic interactions with the TSHR. M22 H1, H2, and H3 form the outer edge of a negatively charged cavity, which interacts with a highly positively charged area formed at the N terminal of the TSHR by R38, K58, R80, H105, and K129. Mutations in the TSHR and in M22 In an earlier study (14), we analyzed the effects of mutations in the TSHR and M22 on the TSHR­M22 interaction and the TSHR­TSH interaction. These experiments indicated that TSHR mutations R80A, E107A, R109A, K129A, K183A, Y185A, and R255A had a marked effect (Table 5A) on the

ability of M22 Fab to stimulate cyclic AMP production in TSHR-transfected CHO cells (but had no effect on TSH stimulation, indicating that the TSHR was expressed in a functionally active form). Analysis of these seven TSHR residues in the TSHR­M22 complex showed that all seven interact with M22. Furthermore, they are involved in 9 out of the 22 hydrogen bonds and salt bridges present in the structure (Table 2) while TSHR R109 produces two water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Table 2) and strong van der Waals interactions (Table 3A). Also, R80, E107, R109, K183, Y185, and R255 are involved in both non-hydrogen bonding polar interactions and in hydrophobic contacts with M22 (Table 2). Mutation of another TSHR residue, F130 to alanine, also had a marked effect on M22 activity (Table 5A) and the crystal structure shows F130 in hydrophobic contacts with M22 HC P97 and HC G98 (Table 2). TSHR K209 is involved in nonhydrogen-bonding polar interactions with M22 LC Y50, forming hydrophobic contacts with M22 LC Q53 (Table 2) and attractive electrostatic interactions with M22 LC D51 and LC D52 (Table 4); this provides an explanation why mutation TSHR K209E resulted in loss of M22 activity (<20% of activity with WT TSHR) (Table 5A). Also, mutation of several M22 residues resulted in reduced M22 Fab stimulating activity (Table 5B) and these amino acids were found to be involved in interactions with the TSHR in the crystal structure. For example, the stimulating activity of M22 with HC mutation R28D was reduced (Table 5B) most likely due to disruption of interactions between M22 R28 and TSHR260 that are evident in the crystal structure, that is, three salt bridges with TSHR D151, polar interactions with TSHR F153 and I152, and hydrophobic contacts with TSHR I152 and F153 (Tables 2 and 4). Also, mutation of M22 HC D52 caused loss of activity (Table 5B), and this residue is involved in strong electrostatic interactions with TSHR R80 (Tables 2 and 4) and polar interactions with TSHR H105 (Table 2). Furthermore, M22 HC D54 is in strong elec-

trostatic interaction with TSHR R80 and is hydrogen bonded with TSHR T104 through water, while M22 HC Y56 is in polar interaction with TSHR R38 and in strong hydrophobic contact with TSHR R38, T56, and R80 (Tables 2 and 4); indeed, mutation of M22 HC D54 or Y56 caused loss of activity (Table 5B). M22 LC D52 is hydrogen bonded with TSHR Q235 and forms a salt bridge with TSHR K209 (Tables 2 and 4), and mutation of LC D52 also caused some loss of M22 activity (Table 5B). A further series of mutation experiments were carried out to investigate the strong electrostatic interactions between the

D52K caused marked loss of stimulating activity with WT TSHR (Table 5B; Fig. 5B, C). When M22 HC D52K (almost inactive with WT TSHR) was tested with TSHR R80D (reverse charge on the respective residues), stimulating activity of M22 HC D52K was restored (Fig. 5D). Amino acids in the C-terminal part of the TSHR LRD surface are also important for interactions with M22. TSHR R255 is of particular interest. For example, mutation of TSHR R255 to an oppositely charged residue (R255D) caused marked loss of responsiveness to M22 but not to TSH (Table 5A) (14). This is consistent with the interactions seen in the crystal structure including TSHR R255 forming two hydrogen bonds with M22 LC V58, hydrogen bonds via water molecules with M22 LC K54 and LC D60, electrostatic interactions with LC D60, polar interactions with LC D60, and hydrophobic contacts with LC L54 (Tables 2 and 4). The variable and framework region genes of M22 HC and LC genes of M22 have undergone somatic mutation with overall replacement=silent ratios of 3.8 and 10 for the HC and LC, respectively (7). Consideration of the M22 amino acids important for interacting with the TSHR indicates that residues HC CDR2 T53, HC CDR3 E96 and P97, LC CDR2 Q53, and LC CDR3 D95A have mutated away from their respective germline sequences (7). Also, R28 in the HC framework corresponds to oppositely charged serine in the germline sequence (7).

shown in Figure 6 where the two structures are superimposed. The positions of M22 Fab and FSH relative to the concave surface of their respective receptors are remarkably similar; the pseudo dyad axes of M22 and FSH coincide. Both ligands clasp their receptors at 908 to the receptor tube length axis. Furthermore, the overall structures of both complexes are very similar with the rmsd on Ca core atoms of the re° ° ° ceptor LRDs being 1.1 A. A total of 2500 A2 and 2600 A2 of solvent-accessible surface area is buried in the interface between the TSHR or the FSHR and their ligands, respectively. Residues from all 10 b strands (or residues next to them) from the concave surface of the TSHR or FSHR interact with M22 or FSH, respectively. Except for strands 1, 8, and 9, all other strands present interactions by residues that are structurally equivalent (i.e., same position in space) for both receptors. However, the residues involved in hydrogen bonding are not structurally equivalent in the two complexes and this is probably due to differences in the number of hydrogen bonds: 6 in the FSHR­FSH complex and 14 in the TSHR­M22 complex (Fig. 6C; Tables 2 and 6). There are seven structurally equivalent residues in the TSHR and FSHR, which produce strong electrostatic interactions with M22 or FSH, respectively, and a large part of the concave surface of both receptors is involved in binding to their respective ligands. However, M22 interacts with residues in the C-terminal part

of the TSHR whereas the equivalent residues in the FSHR are not involved in binding with FSH (Fig. 6D). Discussion The crystal structure of the TSHR in complex with M22 we describe provides details, at the molecular level, of how a pathogenic autoantibody interacts with its target, the TSHR. In our study we used an insect cell expression system to produce part of the extracellular region of the TSHR (amino acids 1­260) which has the ability to bind M22 with high affinity and in particular with a very slow dissociation rate (12). This feature was helpful in producing TSHR260­M22 Fab complexes that remained intact during several rounds of purification. In addition, allowing binding of M22 Fab to TSHR260 in the culture medium protected the expressed receptor from degradation and denaturation (data not shown). We obtained crystals of TSHR260­M22 Fab suitable for crystallization in each of two separate purification and crystallization experiments. The diffraction data obtained with crystals from the first trial allowed the structure to be solved at ° ° 3.1 A resolution and crystals from the second trial at 2.55 A resolution. In the asymmetric unit of our crystals, there was only one complex consisting of one molecule of TSHR260 bound to one molecule of M22 Fab. Consequently, there was

no evidence of dimer formation. In the case of studies on the FSH­FSHR (amino acids 1­268) complex, the asymmetric unit contained two FSH­FSHR complexes (3). This difference could reflect differences in packing of the crystals although dimerization of the FSH­FSHR complex has been suggested (3).

This permitted us to compared to 14,001 reflections at 3.1 A improve the data fit of our model resulting in lower R=Rfree values (18.1%=24.5% versus 20.7%=28.3%, respectively, at

408 ° ° 2.55 A and 3.1 A). Also, the higher resolution data allowed us to model more comprehensively the solvation state of the complex assembly in the crystal. The additional water molecules observed (289 compared to 38) provided further information about water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions between the TSHR and M22 Fab. The higher resolution data set also produced clearer and more defined electron density maps, thus lowering the error in determi° ° nation of atomic positions (0.30 A compared to 0.54 A). Interactions between the TSHR and M22 present in the crystal structure were tested in experiments involving mutated TSHR and=or M22. Mutations of residues showing strong interactions in the structure influenced M22 activity, indicating that the binding arrangements in the complex reflect the interactions of M22 with intact, functionally active TSHR at least in vitro and it is most likely that similar interactions take place when the TSHR and M22 combine in vivo. The crystal structure of the complex shows M22 Fab clasping the concave surface of the TSHR LRD at 908 to the TSHR helical tube axis. The concave surface of the TSHR LRD, which interacts with M22, is large and extends from the N terminus to the C terminus. The extensive M22 surface in the interface with the TSHR [more than typically observed for an antibody (29)], together with a large number of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals interactions in the interface, reflects the high affinity of M22 for the TSHR compared to the affinity of TSH (Table 5A) (1,30) or FSH (31) for their respective receptors. For example, there are only six hydrogen bonds in the interaction between FSH and the FSHR LRD (3). It also appears that M22 binds the TSHR in a ``lock and key'' fashion with essentially no movement in the atoms of M22 residues when TSHR binding occurs. Consequently, loss of free energy through induction of a conformational change in M22 does not occur during binding and this is consistent with the observed high affinity of the antibody­receptor interaction (6,7,12). In contrast to M22 binding considerable conformational changes occur in FSH on receptor binding (3). The HC of M22 Fab has more residues that interact with the TSHR than the LC, although both chains form a number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with the receptor (14 for the HC and 8 for the LC). The majority of interacting residues of M22 Fab are located in hypervariable regions L2, H2, and H3, and the residues of H1, H2, and H3 form the outer edge of a negatively charged cavity, which interacts with a positively charged area of the TSHR (R38, K58, R80, H105, and K129). This feature provides opportunities for designing molecular structures that could prevent M22 (and other TSHR autoantibodies with similar surface characteristics) binding to the receptor. For example, a small molecule designed to interfere with M22 interacting with the highly positively charged ridge at the N terminus of the TSHR would be expected to inhibit the receptor­autoantibody interaction. In addition, small molecules designed to interfere in interactions involving other parts of the TSHR LRD, such as the region around TSHR R255, should act as inhibitors of stimulating autoantibodies. This could open new avenues in the treatment of Graves' disease; that is, rather than interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis as current medications do, the new compounds would act at the start of the pathogenic pathway involved in thyroid hyperstimulation. Furthermore, these new compounds would inhibit binding of TSHR au-

SANDERS ET AL. toantibodies to the TSHR in all tissues that express functional receptors. For example, if the involvement of TSHR autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy is confirmed (32), new forms of treatment to control the eye signs of Graves' disease could be developed using specific small-molecule inhibitors of thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies (33). The manner in which M22 positions itself on the TSHR is very similar to that of FSH on the FSHR (3) and consequently very similar to that of TSH on the TSHR (4,5). It is remarkable that the autoantibody adopts almost identical binding features to the hormone. Previous studies have indicated considerable overlap between the TSH and TSHR autoantibody binding sites (1,6,7,11,13,14,33­35) and the crystal structure shows that residues from all 10 b strands (or residues next to them) from the concave surface of the TSHR interact with M22. This binding arrangement is very similar to that observed in the FSH­FSHR LRD complex (3) and this is reflected in the rmsd on Ca core atoms of the receptor LRDs of ° 1.1 A when the two complexes are superimposed. However, M22 interacts with residues in the C-terminal part of the TSHR LRD whereas the equivalent residues in the FSHR are not involved in binding with FSH (Fig. 6D). Consequently, almost the entire concave surface of the TSHR LRD is involved in interaction with the thyroid-stimulating autoantibody M22, and residues in both the N- and the C-terminal part of the LRD form important networks of bonds with M22 (Figs. 2 and 4; Tables 2­4). A detailed comparison of interactions between the TSHR and M22 with the interactions between the TSHR and TSH would be of interest. Now that the crystal structures of the TSHR260­M22 and FSH­FSHR (amino acids 1­268) complexes are available, the binding arrangements between TSH and the TSHR can be assessed with greater confidence (4,5) and compared to that of M22 binding. Studies of this type are currently underway in our laboratories. The structure of the TSHR LRD itself is very similar to the reported structure of the FSHR LRD (3) except for some differences in the number of b strands (Fig. 6). However, the higher resolution we obtained for the TSHR LRD structure ° ° (2.55 A compared to 2.9 A for the FSHR LRD) is likely to be particularly helpful in studies on the structure and function of the glycoprotein hormone receptor family. The TSHR ° LRD structure at 2.55 A resolution defined five glycosylation sites that correspond to the predicted glycosylation sites. Fur° thermore, the 2.55 A resolution data allowed identification of 11 water molecules located in the interface between the TSHR LRD and M22 Fab. These water molecules mediate hydrogen bonding and fill up cavities in the interface between the TSHR LRD and M22 Fab. Although the structures of the glycoprotein hormones and their respective receptors are very similar, cross reactivity is weak if it occurs at all (36). Now the structures of important parts of both the TSHR and FSHR are known, further analysis and comparison of these structures should permit a greater understanding of the molecular basis of glycoprotein hormone specificity. Receptor binding by TSH, other glycoprotein hormones, and TSHR autoantibodies initiates transmission of a signal to the receptor's transmembrane domain (TMD) which triggers G-protein activation, but how this signal is initiated and transmitted to the TMD is not yet understood (1,30,31,34,36,

TSH RECEPTOR CRYSTAL STRUCTURE 37). It is possible that hormone or autoantibody residues not involved in direct binding to the LRD produce interactions with the TSHR cleavage domain (4,5,13,36­38) and=or TMD. This could either occur in the same molecule (i.e., in a receptor monomer) or involve interactions with a second receptor molecule (i.e., in a receptor dimer) (36­39). Candidate residues in TSH could be the a-chain amino acids 11­20 (3,30) and in M22, the L1 and=or L3 residues. Furthermore, the asymmetric relative orientation of M22 HC and LC hypervariable regions (7) may provide M22 with the ability to interact with parts of the TSHR in addition to the LRD, and this feature could have a role in receptor activation. Overall, the most surprising outcome from the crystal structure of the TSHR­M22 complex is that the autoantibody shows very similar receptor-binding arrangements to the natural ligand TSH even though the structures and origins of the two thyroid stimulators are very different. This suggests that there has been evolutionary convergence (40,41) in the process of the formation of the autoantibodies, which mimic hormone binding and action so closely.
