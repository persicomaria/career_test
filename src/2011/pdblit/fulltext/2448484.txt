The structure of form I I crystals of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor has been investigated by joint refinement of X-ray and neutron data. Crystallographic R factors for the final model were 0.200 for the X-ray data extending to 1 A resolution and 0-197 for the 1.8A neutron data. This model was strongly restrained, with 0.020 A root-mean-square (r.m.s.) departure of bond lengths from their ideal values and 0.019 A r.m.s, departure of planar groups from planarity. The resulting structure was very similar to that of crystal form I (r.m.s. deviation for main chain atoms was 0-40 A); nevertheless larger deviations were observed in particular regions of the chain. Twenty out of 63 ordered water molecules occupy similar positions (deviation less than 1 A) in both models. Eleven amide hydrogens were found to be protected from exchange after three months of soaking the crystals in deuterated mother liquor at p H 8-2. Their locations were in excellent agreement with the results obtained by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, but the rates of exchange are much lower in the crystalline state. 0022-2836/84/340301-29 $03.00/0 301 © 1984 Academic Press Inc.

1. Introduction

Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is one of the most extensively studied proteins. Its three-dimensional structure has been determined for the crystals of form I (Huber et al., 1970) using X-ray data extending to 2.5 A resolution and multiple isomorphous replacement. The structure was subsequently refined (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975) using data extending to 1.5 A and a real-space procedure of Diamond (1971). The availability of a highly refined structure for this small protein (only 58 amino acids) led to its utilization in a large variety of experiments. The internal motions in BPTI t have been studied extensively by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques (for a review, see Wagner, 1983). BPTI provided an invaluable model in the development of two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance as a technique capable of providing three-dimensional information about the protein without a reference to the crystal structure (Wiithrich et al., 1982). Amide hydrogen exchange has been studied extensively (Nagayama & Wfithrich, 1982; Wagner & Wfithrich, 1982; for a review, see Englander & Kallenbach, 1983). BPTI was the first protein for which detailed experimental information about the folding of the polypeptide chain became available (for a review, see Baldwin, 1978). Computer simulations of internal protein dynamics have been developed using BPTI as a model (Levitt, 1981,1983; Brooks & Karplus, 1983). The methods of structure prediction based on the amino acid sequence were also applied first to BPTI (Tanaka & Scheraga, 1975; Levitt & Warshel, 1975). The need for a well-refined, high-resolution structure of BPTI is clear. The limits of resolution of the protein structures studied by diffraction methods are usually dictated by the quality of available crystals. Few proteins are capable of providing measurable diffraction data beyond 1 A resolution. Teeter & Hendrickson (1979) reported that reflections corresponding to plane spacings as close as 0.79 A have been observed during preliminary investigations of crystals of a small plant protein, crambin. The structure of this protein has been refined recently using X-ray data extending to 0.945 A resolution (Hendrickson, personal communication). Another protein refined with X-ray data extending to beyond 1 A resolution was avian pancreatic polypeptide (Glover et al., 1983). Both of these proteins are smaller than BPTI. The limits of diffraction of form I crystals of BPTI were not unusually high and only when a new crystal form (form II) was found (Walter & Huber, 1983) did it become possible to measure X-ray data to resolutions exceeding 1 A. The rationale of studying this new crystal form was to obtain the most detailed structure, as well as to compare the structure of this very well-characterized protein in the two crystal forms and thus to correlate the changes in the structure with molecular packing. Neutron diffraction has been shown to provide additional information about protein structure not easily obtained from X-ray diffraction studies (for a review, see Wlodawer, 1982). This technique is particularly sensitive in locating hydrogen atoms, since their scattering lengths are of the order of those for carbon, oxygen Abbreviations used: BPTI, bovine pancreatictrypsin inhibitor; PEG, polyethyleneglycol;n.m.r., nuclear magneticresonance;r.m.s., root-mean-square.

and nitrogen. Neutron diffraction has been applied successfully in the studies of myoglobin (Hanson & Schoenborn, 1981; Phillips & Schoenborn, 1981), trypsin (Kossiakoff & Spencer, 1981), ribonuclease A (Wlodawer & SjSlin, 1983), lysozyme (Bentley & Mason, 1981) and crambin (Teeter & Kossiakoff, 1984). This technique was found to be very powerful in the investigations of the process of hydrogen exchange in crystals (Wlodawer & SjSlin, 1982; Kossiakoff, 1982; Bentley et al., 1983). Wlodawer & Hendrickson (1982) have shown t h a t simultaneous refinement with X - r a y and neutron data works well and that it can provide more information about protein structure than refinement using either type of data alone. Large protein crystals are needed for the measurement of high-quality neutron diffraction data, but the crystals of form I I of B P T I can be grown quite large, making such experiments feasible. This protein provides, indeed, a system of choice for neutron diffraction studies, in view of the availability of a large a m o u n t of data on hydrogen exchange collected using other techniques. We expected to be able to correlate diffraction results with those obtained by other methods, in particular n.m.r. For the reasons discussed above, we began the study of form I I crystals of B P T I by a combination of X - r a y and neutron diffraction, using the data extending to the highest measurable resolution that could be obtained with the instruments available.

2. Materials a n d M e t h o d s
(a) Crystal growth and treatment Crystals of form II of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor used for X-ray experiments were grown as described previously (Walter & Huber, 1983). They belong to the space group P212121, a = 74.1A, b = 23.4A, c = 28.9A. Large crystals used for neutron experiments were grown by a slight modification of that procedure. Lyophilized protein was dissolved in water at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. Sodium azide (0-02%, w/v) was added to inhibit bacterial growth. Separately~ a solution of 0-5 M-K2HPO4 was made, with pH adjusted to 9"5. Crystallization solution was prepared by mixing 100 #1 of protein solution with 40 ~1 of the buffer and it was placed in a depression slide inside a plastic sandwich box filled with 15 ml of the buffer. The mixture was allowed to equilibrate by vapor diffusion for 4 days, after which a seed crystal was added. The seed crystal was first washed for 30 s in buffer solution in which it just starts to dissolve. It was then transferred to the equilibrated protein solution and was left undisturbed for 2 months. The crystal used for neutron data collection grew as a plate with the shortest dimension (along a) of about 1 mm and a total volume of 8 mm 3. At the completion of its growth, it was rapidly transferred t o a stabilizing solution containing 10 raM-potassium phosphate (pH 8.2), 0.02% (w/v) NaN 3 and 30% PEG of average Mr 20,000. We have found that the presence of PEG enhances stability of the crystals during storage. The large crystal was deuterated by slow addition of stabilizing solution made with 2H20 instead of H20. Heavy water used in this study was manufactured in 1983 by the facility in Rjukan, Norway (batch 367, initial isotopic purity 99.997%). Even though the PEG used in the stabilizing solution was not deuterated, it was not expected to increase the incoherent background since such a large polymer probably cannot enter the crystal. Several complete exchanges of the solvent were made during a period of about 3 months. The crystal showed no obvious signs of deterioration (such as cracking, which was usually observed while deuterating ribonuclease A; Wlodawer & SjSlin, 1983). It was mounted in a quartz tube and immobilized with quartz wool (WIodawer. 1980). Contrary to previous practice, the crystal

was dried and only a small drop of mother liquor was placed at the b o t t o m of the tube. The tube was sealed with silicone grease, wax and Epoxy, preventing any possibility of drying. Protein crystals mounted in such a manner were found to be stable for years (Wlodawer, 1982). (b) Data collection and processing X-ray intensity d a t a were collected on a computer-controlled 4-circle Siemens diffractometer using the (0/20 scan technique. Ni-filtered CuK~ radiation was used. Focusto-crystal distance was 37 cm and crystal-to-detector distance was 32 cm. The intensity profile of each reflection was scanned twice in steps of 1/100 ° in o~. The background was measured on each side of the peak. I n total, 18 crystals with volumes of up to 0'5 m m 3 were used for measurements to 0.94 A resolution. A reference reflection was measured for each crystal every hour; it served as an indicator of radiation damage and was used for scaling of the individual d a t a sets. However; no sin 0/£ dependence was considered in this scaling procedure. Crystals were discarded as soon as the intensities of the reference reflections dropped by more t h a n 10% . The intensity d a t a from each crystal were corrected for absorption by an empirical m e t h o d (Huber & K o p f m a n , 1969). Absorption reflections were measured to 1.4 A resolution. The transmission surface was extrapolated for higherresolution data. This m a y have introduced some errors, especially to the d a t a at v e r y high resolution, and could have been partially responsible for the relatively high R factor after refinement (see below). The absorption-corrected d a t a from all crystals were merged and scaled together by means of the overlap of the various d a t a sets using the P I ~ O T E I N program system of W. Steigemann (Steigemann, 1974). Table 1 summarizes the X - r a y intensity datacollection statistics. Neutron data were collected using the flat-cone diffractometer (Prince et al., 1978) located at the National Bureau of Standards Reactor. The neutrons were monochromatized by reflection from a 50 m m × 100 m m graphite crystal t h a t had a mosaic spread of 40 rain. The wavelength of the neutrons was 1.68 A. The neutron flux, measured in the sample position with a calibrated fission monitor, was 6 × 10 e neutrons em -2 s-1 (estimated error + 10%). The diffractometer was equipped with a linear position-sensitive detector 1 m long, mounted vertically on the counter arm. The neutron diffraction d a t a set was collected in 2 parts. A d a t a set extending to 2.0 A resolution for the level /c = 0 and somewhat higher resolution for the upper levels was TABLE 1

collected in flat-cone geometry. I n this mode the crystal was rotated around its shortest real axis (b) while the data for 1 level were measured. Next, the detector was moved to a position appropriate for a new level, and the process was repeated. Altogether data from 11 levels (]c = 0 to 10) were collected. A 270 ° or longer ~ scan was performed for each level (in 0.09 ° steps, counting time approx. 2 rain/step), so that each accessible reflection was measured at least 3 times. The reflection intensities were integrated by using the dynamic mask procedure (SjSlin & Wlodawer, 1981), which improved the precision of the data and increased the number of statistically significant reflections [I > 1.5a(I)]. Symmetry R factors ranged from 0.048 for lower levels to 0.126 for the level ]c = 10; 3380 unique reflections out of the total of 3893 were considered to be observed. Reflections either inaccessible in the flat-cone geometry or beyond the resolution range accessible in the chosen setting of the diffractometer were measured in equatorial geometry, neglecting intensities falling outside of the equatorial plane of the instrument. The reflections were measured by an (9 step-scan method, with 61 steps counted every 0.025 ° (total width l'5°). The time spent counting each reflection was about 20 rain. This time is approximate since the counting periods were based on the output of a low-efficiency main-beam monitor, which compensated for the flux instability. The data measured in the equatorial and flat-cone geometries were merged by using the scaling algorithm of Hamilton et al. (1965). The combined data set did not have any blind regions, which would have been present if the crystal were rotated around a single axis in the flat-cone geometry. The scaling R factor was 0"076. (Rsc~ = ~, IF1 -sY21/~, F1, where F 1 and F 2 represented the structure amplitudes measured in the equatorial and flat-cone geometries, respectively.) The data were virtually complete to 1-8 A resolution, with some reflections measured in a shell extending to 1.66 ~,. The total number of unique reflections considered to be observed was 4044 (78°/o of the theoretical maximum). Over half of the reflections in the shell at 1-82 A were observed. The contamination of the beam with neutrons of wavelength ),/2 was estimated by measuring a number of axial reflections prohibited by the symmetry of the space group of the BPTI crystal (P212121). Measurable intensities were observed for the reflections 001, 003, 030, 500 and 700. The ratios F2()[/2)/F2()[) for these reflections averaged 0.028 ± 0'006, in good agreement with the 20% contamination of the incident beam expected from the Maxwellian distribution. Since the reflectivity of crystals increases as a function o f ) 3 the sample crystal helps in monochromatizing the beam. A computer program was written to apply the 2/2 correction to the diffraction data. Since the corrected data set differed only very slightly from the starting data set (R = 0.003), we are of the opinion that the influence of neutrons with wavelength )[/2 is so small that it is practically negligible for protein data collection at the resolution of less than about 1.5 A, (e) Computational procedure8 for joint refinement The computational procedure for the joint protein structure refinement with the X-ray and neutron data was used for BPTI refinement. This procedure was described in detail by Wlodawer & Hendrickson (1982) and was previously used successfully for ribonuclease A (Wlodawer & SjSlin~ 1983). It required relatively minor conceptual modifications to the stereochemically restrained refinement procedures (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1981) that have been used successfully to refine a number of protein structures. The principal modifications enabled hydrogens to be included in the model, with separate scattering lengths for H and 2H atoms. The X-ray and neutron diffraction data had separate weights, but otherwise all diffraction data, together with stereochemical restraint information, were used to calculate a single matrix. Relative weights for the 2 types of data were determined on the basis of experience and were not directly related to their estimated standard deviations. We aimed at balancing the influence of these factors and at preventing domination of the refinement by either type of data. Amino acid standard groups that contained hydrogen positions were prepared on the basis of neutron structures whenever available. The contribution of hydrogen atoms was initially neglected in the calculation of

306

X-ray scattering factors, while their positions were identified as either H or :H for the choice of appropriate scattering lengths in the neutron calculations. In the last stages of refinement hydrogen atoms were used with X-ray data as well. The version of the program used for full structure refinement did not allow variable hydrogen/deuterium occupancy ratios. A separate version was therefore used to refine these occupancies. This special version of the refinement program allowed the occupancies for all atoms (and not only hydrogen) to vary and was run only to refine the occupancies, that is, without allowing the positional and thermal parameters to vary (Wlodawer & SjSlin, 1982). Difference Fourier maps were examined by using interactive computer graphics. The program FRODO (Jones, 1978), implemented on the VAXl]/780 for the Evans and Sutherland Multi-Picture System by B. Bush, allowed us to manipulate the model and to fit it to density maps. The difference Fourier maps were usually calculated with either X-ray or neutron coefficients of the type 2F o - F¢. For some regions where the structure was more seriously in doubt, the maps were sometimes calculated with the coefficients F o - F¢ after the contribution of a portion of the atoms to structure factor calculations was subtracted. Such "fragment AF" maps were expected to show less refinement-induced bias. 3. Results (a) X-ray structure refinement The steps of X - r a y structure refinement are summarized in Table 2. Initially the refined model of the crystal form I (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975; Marquart et al., 1983) was oriented and shifted in the form I I crystal cell according to the unique solutions provided b y Patterson search calculations (Walter & Huber, 1983). Structure factors calculated for this transformed model had an R factor of 0.463 in the resolution range 2.5 to 8.0 A. Residues 1 to 3 and 57 to 58 as well as the 60 ordered water molecules observed in the first crystal form were initially excluded from structure-factor calculation. The refinement was started by applying a rigid-body procedure (CORELS; Sussman et al., 1977). Only three rotational and three translational p a r a m e t e r s were varied while d a t a between 3.0 A and 6.0 A resolution were included. After four cycles of CORELS the shifts were small (0.04 A translation and 2 ° rotation), but the R factor dropped to 0.386 (2.5 to 8.0 A). Structure refinement was continued with the energy restraint refinement p r o g r a m E R E F of J a c k & Levitt (1978) modified by H. Deisenhofer and G. Remington. The potential energy p a r a m e t e r s suggested b y Levitt (1974) were used. During the cyclic refinement procedure F o - F ¢ Fourier maps were calculated and inspected either as stacked minimaps or at a Vector General graphics display system with the program F R O D O (Jones, 1978). The resolution of the included reflection d a t a was increased in stages during the refinement. In the early stages of refinement (see Table 2) electron density was observed for residues 1 to 3, which were omitted from structure-factor calculations at the beginning. All atoms of the N-terminal residues Argl, Pro2 and Asp3, except the carboxyl group of Asp3, were located in the electron density and activated for refinement. No significant density was detectable for the C-terminal residues Gly57 (except for the amide N) and Ala58 even in the final stage of X - r a y refinement. In the crystal form I electron density was observed for both residues only during the final stages of E R E F refinement (H. Deisenhofer, personal communication).

In the course of refinement about 70 density peaks were interpreted as ordered water molecules and activated for refinement. Between Arg20 NH1 and Tyr35 OH very close density peaks were observed which originally were assigned as water molecules, later removed from structure-factor calculations and finally, during the joint X-ray and neutron refinement, identified as a phosphate group (see below). Weaker energy restraints (about one-third of those suggested by M. Levitt) were applied next and finally a few cycles of energetically unrestrained refinement (free atom refinement) were carried out. In this ease the standard deviation of bond lengths increased to more than 0.08 A and the standard deviation of bond angles to more than 5 ° . As expected, the largest deviations from ideal geometry were observed for the side-chain groups less-defined in the Fourier maps. For example, the bond distances of Glu7 CG-CD and Glu49 CD-OE2 became 1.9 A and 0.9 A, respectively. This refinement procedure converged to an R value of 0-198. At this stage we decided to refine anisotropic thermal parameters of the model using the restrained refinement program P R O L S Q (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1981). The anisotropie fl factors were restrained to prevent unreasonably large deviations. Again, we experimented with two different paths of refinement of positional parameters. The r.m.s, deviations of the unrestrained refined model from ideal geometry, 0.094 A for bond lengths and 5.58 ° for bond angles (main chain: 0.059 A and 4.37 °, respectively), were regarded as unacceptably large. Figure 1 shows the positional deviations of the backbone atoms (N, CA, C) after optimal superposition of the restrained and unrestrained refined models. The refined anisotropic temperature factors turned out, on the whole, to be reasonable at least for the well-defined atoms. For example, all four T y r hydroxyl oxygen atoms and 39 of the 56 ordered carbonyl oxygen atoms have their lowest r.m.s. deviation from equilibrium position along the C-O bond. For the restrained model the overall average temperature factor became 15.3 _~2 for the protein atoms and 40.9 A2 for the ordered solvent atoms. The R factor was 0.196 in the resolution range 0.94 to 6.0 A. This model (stage 19) was subsequently used for joint refinement with the neutron data. In view of a large number of crystals used to measure X-ray data, we have experimented with the use of calculated structure factors as a reference data set (weight = 1.0) in the scaling. The use of resealed data resulted in a decrease of the R factor by 1"3~o, but introduced no essential structural changes. Since we felt that our aim was to achieve high quality of the model rather than the lowest R factor, this line of calculations was abandoned, in view of the uncertainties introduced by the inclusion of calculated structure factors in the scaling. (b)

Progress of joint refinement

The model resulting from restrained X-ray refinement of B P T I was used for the initial phasing of the neutron data (disregarding the anisotropic temperature factors). The initial R factor was 0"348 for 3950 neutron structure factors, which excluded the inner shell extending to 7.2 A, based on a model containing 526

The quality of the resulting difference maps was nevertheless quite good even at this stage, with many hydrogen atoms whose positions should have been predetermined by stereochemistry clearly visible (Fig. 2). It was also clear at this stage that some methyl rotors could be oriented properly (Fig. 3) and that some amide hydrogen atoms were protected from exchange, while others were present as deuterium atoms (Fig. 4).

FIG. 5. Sections through 2 F o - F ~ neutron differenceFourier maps of Gln31 before joint refinement (left) and after manual reorientation followedby refinement (right). Contoured as in Fig. 2. was then examined using computer graphics and compared with the map described above. The positions of a number of deuterium atoms belonging to sidechain hydroxyl groups were quite obvious and were adjusted accordingly. These changes were introduced to threonines 11, 32 and 54, to tyrosines 23 and 35, and to Ser47. It became very likely that the side-chain amide of Gln31 was improperly assigned and the position of the oxygen and of the nitrogen with attached deuterium atoms was reversed (Fig. 5). The map also suggested the necessity for slight adjustment of the positions of the side-chain atoms of Lys46, Met52 and Arg53. No a t t e m p t was made at this stage to orient terminal methyl groups and while their arbitrary co-ordinates were kept, the hydrogen atoms were assigned zero weights. Similarly, even though m a n y amide hydrogens could have been assigned unambiguously as either hydrogen or deuterium, this was not done and their weights were kept as zero. This conservative approach was followed in order to prevent any model-induced bias from influencing subsequent refinement. This model was used as a starting point of joint refinement with the X-ray and neutron data. Initial R factors were 0.217 for the X-ray data in the I0 to 0.94 A shell and 0.315 for the neutron data extending from i0 to 1.8 A. Fourteen cycles of refinement lowered the respective R factors to 0"210 and 0.232 while the agreement of the model with the standard geometry was made considerably worse (for example, r.m.s, deviations in bond lengths not involving hydrogen atoms increased from 0.020 to 0.028 A and deviations of planar atoms from ideal positions increased from 0.019 to 0@27 A). As expected, the new difference Fourier map was much less noisy than the original one and was consequently easier to interpret. At this stage, the identity of amide hydrogen atoms was investigated in a neutron refinement in which the positional and thermal parameters for all atoms was kept constant while their occupancies were allowed to vary. Temperature factors for the amide hydrogen atoms were assigned as (B+ ~/~) of the adjacent nitrogens (Kossiakoff, 1982). Convergence was reached after ten cycles and while

the occupancies of a majority of deuteriums tended to average about 0.75, 11 of them turned negative, indicating the presence of unexchanged hydrogen atoms. There was no clear indication of partially exchanged sites and we tentatively interpreted the lower average occupancy of the exchanged sites as being due to the errors in the estimates of the temperature factors for the amides, resulting from previous refinement. The new assignments of the amides were used in subsequent refinements. The orientation of methyl hydrogen atoms was investigated in a manner suggested by Kossiakoff & Spencer (1981). Sections of F o - F ¢ difference Fourier maps were calculated in planes containing all three hydrogen atoms of each methyl group and the sums of scattering densities corresponding to all atoms were plotted as a function of the torsion angle in increments of l0 °. These plots had clear minima for most methyl groups (Fig. 6), even though the maps themselves were seldom clear (Fig. 3). We also tried a similar approach using X-ray data extending to 1 A resolution, but the peaks due to the scattering of hydrogen were much less pronounced, confirming the neutron data to be much more suitable for this purpose, even though their resolution was much lower. Examination of the 2 F o - F ¢ maps indicated the possibility of alternative orientations due to static disorder for four side-chains: Glu7, Glu49, Met52 and Arg53. A number' of other residues were also adjusted manually and the interpretation of solvent was revised. This new model was further refined, yielding R factors of 0.217 and 0"218 for the X-ray and neutron data, respectively. Reinterpretation of the X-ray difference Fourier map indicated that the positions originally assigned to water molecules 300 and 301 are probably occupied by a well-ordered phosphate (the neutron map was ambiguous). Densities corresponding to atoms belonging to one side-chain, which was previously considered to be disordered (Asp3), now appeared in the X-ray and neutron maps, but the alternative positions for Glu49 and Arg53 were no longer clear and were deleted

Two amino acids on the carboxyl end were placed in the density, which now appeared in both maps (quite clear in the X-ray map and not as good in the neutron map), and their occupancies were set to l. In the subsequent refinement the lower limit of resolution of the data was increased from l0 to 7.2 A, eliminating about 50 reflections from each data set for

which the observed and calculated structure factors were in poor agreement. In this round of refinement, occupancies of the solvent atoms were allowed to vary, with the temperature factors and occupancy shifts applied in alternate cycles. The restraints on the geometry of the model were tightened; nevertheless the R factors were lowered to 0.203 and 0.204 when convergence was reached. The co-ordinates were again subjected to seven cycles of occupancy refinement in order to finalize the assignments of amide hydrogens. Resulting occupancies are shown in Figure 7. The distribution of protected and exchanged hydrogen atoms was unchanged compared to the initial assignment, while individual occupancies were much closer to unity. Again, there was no indication of any partially protected sites. At this stage all protein atoms were assigned full occupancies and only the solvent molecules were subtracted (or added) as indicated by the difference Fourier maps. Three more cycles of refinement followed by examination of the maps completed the procedure. The resulting model has R factors of 0.200 (X-ray) and 0.197 (neutron). The bond lengths differ from the ideal values by 0.020 A for non-hydrogen atoms and 0.018 A for hydrogen, the departure from planarity is 0.019 A and the chiral volumes differ by 0.232 A 3 from their ideal values. (c) Secondary structure The secondary structure of BPTI in the new crystal form is virtually identical to that observed previously. The hydrogen bonds involving main chain atoms are shown in Figure 8. Two regions of the structure are helical. The a helix near the carboxyl terminus includes six hydrogen bonds (almost three turns) and is quite regular. The residues forming this helix extend from Ser47 through Gly56. This helix does not show the amphipathic character described by Blundell et al. (1983), since only one water molecule is found within a hydrogen bond distance of a carboxyl oxygen. The length of the hydrogen bond between the carboxyl of Glu49 (which is also hydrogen-bonded to Watl01) and the amino group of Art53 is 2-84 A, not significantly different from the 2.91 A average hydrogen bond length for this helix (2.87 A if we do not include the long bond on the amino end of the helix). Average conformational angles for this helix are ( - 6 3 °, -41.5°), closer to the values compiled by Blundell et al. (1983) for a "hydrophilic" helix than to those of a "hydrophobic" helix. The average length of the hydrogen bonds is close to the average for the other hydrophobic helices; similarly, the average C-O-N angle is 154° (150.5 ° if the angle on the amino end of the helix is excluded), closer to the hydrophobic than to the hydrophilic values. Another helical region in BPTI involves one and a half turns of 31o helix near the amino terminus of the protein. The three hydrogen bonds involved in this helix were not mentioned as such after the previous refinement (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975), even though this region is very similar in both crystal forms and the presence of a helix in this segment was originally reported (Huber et al., 1970). The helical nature of this fragment was also recognized by others, sometimes correctly (Levitt, 1983; Wagner, 1983), and sometimes incorrectly as helix (Levitt, 1981; Brooks & Karplus, 1983).

The central part of the BPTI molecule consists of a double-stranded antiparallel fl structure extending from residues 16 to 36. Three pairs of hydrogen bonds are very regular, with less regularity found near the ends of the sheet. In addition, a pair of bonds between Tyr21 and Phe45 adds a suggestion of another short strand, while another extension of the sheet is due to a bond between T h r l l and Gly36. A sharp turn with the angles characteristic for 27 ribbon is caused by a hydrogen bond between Ash44 and Arg42. (d) Intermolecular hydrogen bonds The number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds found in this crystal form of BPTI is quite low. The only main chain bond is made by the amide N of Argl7 and the carbonyl O of Ala25; the bond length is 3.12 A. Three other hydrogen bonds are made by peptide atoms. The hydroxyl group of Tyr21 makes a bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Ala27, while nitrogens NH1 and NH2 of Arg39 make hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Asn44 and Arg42, respectively. Eight intermolecular hydrogen bonds involve water bridges (one of them is formed by the disordered side-chain of Glu7), and an additional six involve waterto-water contacts. The phosphate forms three hydrogen bonds with the sidechains of Arg20 and Tyr35 belonging to one BPT I molecule and one bond with Lys41 of another. The small number of intermolecular hydrogen-bonded interactions is important in interpreting the results of hydrogen-exchange data (see below), since it is unlikely that so few interactions could seriously modify the flexibility and accessibility to solvent of different parts of the secondary structure of BPTI, compared to the situation existing in solution.

(e) Unsatisfied hydrogen bonds
Very few groups that are potentially capable of forming hydrogen bonds are not involved in such interactions. Only two main chain carbonyl oxygens (belonging to residues 15 and 37) do not have identifiable hydrogen bond partners. Both carbonyl groups are located on the surface of the protein and it is most likely that they are hydrated, but the putative water molecules are disordered and thus were not included in the final model. We did not establish any clear hydrogen bonds for seven main-chain amide nitrogens. Four of them are on the surface, including three (32, 57 and 58) that are a part of or in close proximity to the carboxyl terminus, which is at least partially disordered. It is certain that not all of the available density has been fully accounted for in this region, so the previous argument applies here as well. Three non-bonded amides are buried (29, 47 and 49), with the latter two found in a quite hydrophobic environment. The absence of hydrogen bonds in their case is dictated by the structure and must lead to some increase in the energy of the stable form of the protein. However, this type of a compromise must be expected, even in view of its unfavorable energetics, since it is unlikely that a protein can be folded in a fashion regular enough to satisfy all possible hydrogen bonds. We can see, though, that the number of clear exceptions is quite small.

STRUCTURE OF TI~YPSIN INHIBITOI~ (f) Hydrogen exchange

319

The information about amide hydrogen exchange, not available in the X-ray structure determination, becomes accessible during analysis of the neutron data. This happens as a by-product of the soaking of the crystals in deuterated mother liquor, done in order to reduce the incoherent background caused by the presence of hydrogen atoms in the protein. The time required for the exchange of unprotected amide hydrogens is much less than the several months usually spent on solvent exchange, while the most highly protected amides can stay unchanged longer than that (Rosa & Richards, 1981). Neutron methods were successfully used to establish the pattern of amide hydrogen exchange in several proteins. These included ribonuclease A (Wlodawer & SjSlin, 1982,1983), trypsin (Kossiakoff, 1982), lysozyme (Bentley et al., 1983; Mason et al., 1984), metmyoglobin (Raghavan & Sehoenborn, 1984) and erambin (Teeter & Kossiakoff, 1984). Ribonuelease results could be compared with the individual assignments derived by chemical means (Rosa & Richards, 1981,1983), with fair agreement between the two techniques. The discrepancies were probably due mostly to the experimental difficulties inherent in the proteolytic technique, since the errors in amide occupancies were estimated at +15% in the neutron experiment (Wlodawer & Sj51in, 1982). n.m.r, has gained wide acceptance in recent years as a technique suitable for studies of hydrogen exchange. It is much easier experimentally than the chemical methods and can yield exchange rates for individual protons. The main difficulty lies in the interpretation of the results, since the assignment of resonances in the n.m.r, spectra is not straightforward. While 32 amide resonances have been assigned in the n.m.r, spectra of lysozyme and their exchange rates have been compared with the estimates available from a neutron experiment (Bentley et al., 1983), assignment of practically all amides has been achieved so far for only one protein, namely BPTI. Partial results for BPTI were obtained by Richarz et al. (1979) using the traditional proton n.m.r, technique, while the remaining exchange rates were obtained using two-dimensional n.m.r. (Wagner & Wiithrich, 1982). For these reasons, we considered BPTI to be an ideal protein for testing the agreement between the results of these two techniques. The occupancies of amide hydrogen atoms resulting from this study are shown in Figure 7. This Figure shows quite clearly the presence of two classes of amide hydrogen atoms, one corresponding to the unexchanged hydrogen atoms with negative scattering, the other to the exchanged ones, for which the scattering is positive. If all amides contained deuterium atoms, their average occupancy would be 0.65 (standard deviation 0"57). This compares with 0.97 (0.1) for the 58 amide nitrogens, 0"94 (0.13) for ~ carbons, 0.97 (0.07) for carbonyl oxygens and 0.90 (0-14) for ~ hydrogens. On the other hand, by separating the positive and negative scatterers, the average occupancy for the 43 amide deuteriums is 0.94 (0.12) and for 11 amide hydrogens 0-90 (0.09), in line with the occupancies of other mainchain atoms. The deviations of the average occupancies from 1.0 are due to the errors introduced in refinement (most probably in the estimates of temperature factors) and are in agreement with the estimated accuracy of the final structure of

320

the protein. The fact that the standard deviations of the two classes of amide hydrogens are of the same order as for the neighboring atoms shows that we have not detected any partially exchanged sites. While unusual, such a situation is by no means impossible. The fraction of amide hydrogen atoms protected from exchange under the experimental conditions was 20~o. By comparison, the fraction of fully and partially protected amide hydrogen atoms was 22.5% in ribonuelease (Wlodawer & SjSlin, 1982), 32% in trypsin (Kossiakoff, 1982), and 43% in lysozyme (Bentley et al., 1983). Only 3~o of amide hydrogen atoms were found to be even partially protected in metmyoglobin after ten years of exchange (Raghavan & Schoenborn, 1984), while 53% were unexchanged and 24% were partially exchanged in crambin after a week of exchange (Teeter & Kossiakoff, 1984). The degree of protection observed for these proteins varies widely and is clearly more dependent on experimental conditions than on the nature of the protein. These results show little if any correlation between the size of the proteins and the overall degree of protection, even though the relative size of the inner core must be much larger in the proteins having the longer chain. It seems quite remarkable that a protein as small as BPTI has a sufficiently large hydrophobic core to offer such a degree of protection from exchange. The comparison of the individual amide hydrogen atoms observed as protected from exchange in the neutron experiment with their rate constants for the exchange as observed by n.m.r. (Wagner, 1983) shows a remarkable degree of qualitative agreement. One should keep in mind that the n.m.r, exchange rates were quoted at pH 3"5, 36°C, while the crystal used for the neutron experiment was soaked at pH 8.2, 22°C. Nevertheless, of the 11 amides with a rate of exchange lower than 10 .5 min -1 only one was found to be exchanged in the neutron experiment. This amide belongs to Asn44, and its quoted rate of exchange (0.75 x 10-5 rain-1) is three times higher than for the next slower amide in this group (Ilel8). Most of the protected amides are involved in making hydrogen bonds in the regular part of the antiparallel fl pleated sheet. The only two exceptions are the amide of Tyr23, making a strong hydrogen bond with the oxygen OD1 of Asn43, and Gly37, which makes no apparent hydrogen bonds (Fig. 9). Protection of the latter amide is particularly puzzling. Its resonance was not observed in the n.m.r, experiment, so that the neutron result was quite unexpected. It appears that the reason for this protection is the proximity of the phenyl ring of Tyr35. The distance between the amide hydrogen and the center of the ring is 2.6 A, and it might be possible that the ring itself is serving as an acceptor of a quasi hydrogen bond. It is interesting to note that another hydrogen, belonging to the side-chain amide of Asn44, is found at the same distance on the other side of the ring, but this one is clearly exchanged. It is well known, though, that the rates of exchange for the side-chain amide hydrogens are much higher than those for the main chain, so we would not expect the ring to offer much protection in the latter ease. The distribution of protected amides in the structure of BPTI is in good agreement with our understanding of the mechanism of hydrogen exchange and with the patterns of protection noticed in other proteins. It has been noted before

only scattered amides are protected by the interaction with side-chains. The segment of an ~ helix present in B P T I contains six hydrogen bonds and all of its amides are shielded from the solvent. Nevertheless, neither n.m.r, nor neutron data show appreciable protection from exchange for this p a r t of the chain. Similarly, the three amides forming a short 31o helix at the amino terminus are fully exchanged. Only the amides found in the v e r y regular central p a r t of the fi sheet are protected, while those forming the less-regular fringes (Gly28, Alal6) are not. The amide of Asn44 is involved in a sharp 27 t y p e turn and thus is less likely to be protected, as shown b y its rate of exchange being the highest among the "slow" amides. We found no evidence t h a t the intermolecular contacts in the crystal affect the relative rates of exchange of highly protected amides in a n y measurable way. While the qualitative agreement between the results of the n.m.r, and neutron measurements is truly excellent, some unanswered questions a b o u t the correlation of actual exchange rates still remains. Assuming t h a t the exchange of less than 10~o of the protons of any particular amide during the four months spent soaking the crystal in deuterated m o t h e r liquor would be undetectable in the neutron experiment, we arrive at the m a x i m u m exchange rates of 0"6 × 10 -6 rain-1 for the 11 protected protons. While this rate is well within the range listed by Wagner (1983), we should not forget the differences of p H and of t e m p e r a t u r e in the two experiments. Rieharz et al. (1979) investigated the dependence of rate constants on the t e m p e r a t u r e and pH, and while only f r a g m e n t a r y results were presented, it is clear t h a t at room t e m p e r a t u r e the exchange rates are faster b y three to four orders of magnitude at p H 8 compared to p H 3.5.

significantly exceed the expected errors in analysis are observed. These differences are summarized in Table 3. At the N terminus the guanidinium group of Argl is shifted by more than 1 A compared to the structure of form I, allowing different hydrogen bond interactions in both crystal forms. The C-terminal residues Gly57 and Ala58, for which some electron density was observed only during joint X-ray and neutron refinement, occupy different conformations as well. Ala58 appears to be about 7 A away from its location in the crystal form I, where the carboxyl group is within hydrogen bond distance of Argl7 NH2 of a neighboring molecule. In the form II crystal structure Cys30 O and Tyr21 OH of a neighboring molecule are hydrogen bond partners of the earboxyl of AlaS8. Weak electron density as well as high temperature factors in both crystal forms indicate the probable existence of alternative conformations of low occupancy. These results also show that different intermolecular contacts can favor fixed but different conformations of flexible segments. Considering other largely deviating segments, some correlation between them due to crystal contaets becomes apparent. Recalling t h a t there are intermolecular hydrogen bonds between Argl7 NE and Lys26 O, and between Arg39

guanidinium and Glu49 carboxyl and Ala48 N, respectively, in the crystal form I and between Arg39 guanidinium and carbonyl oxygen atoms of Lys41, Arg42 and Ash44 in the crystal form II, some mutual influence is clearly indicated. Although positional differences of up to 0.6 A are observed for amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen atoms that are involved in hydrogen bond formation of the fl structure and the a helix, the corresponding hydrogen bond distances in both structures deviate by less than 0.1 A. Positional shifts forced by different molecular packing are directed in such a way t h a t any increase in hydrogen bond energy is avoided and the elements of secondary structure are preserved. The distribution of temperature factors along the polypeptide backbone has remarkably similar characteristics in the two structures (Fig. 12), indicating that it represents a conserved property of the molecule. This observation agrees with the results reported for trigonal and orthorhombic trypsin (Walter et al., 1982) and for the comparison of hen and human lysozyme (Artymiuk et al., 1979). In particular, the increase of the main chain temperature factors near the carboxyl and amino termini emphasizes the high flexibility of the polypeptide chain at these locations. The smoother course of the temperature-factor distribution in the structure of form II results from the different methods of refinement. The temperature factors were not restrained in the refinement of form I structure, while restraints of thermal parameters of bonded atoms were included in the joint refinement of the crystal structure of form II. (h) Solvent structure Our interpretation of the solvent structure after joint refinement yields 63 ordered water molecules and one phosphate group. Twenty-nine water sites have full occupancy and the rest are apparently only partially occupied. The lowest occupancy in the final model was 0.4. Significant densities were detectable in both neutron and X-ray maps for almost all solvent positions, indicating little if any difference in the solvent structure that would be due to deuteration. Neutron densities for most water molecules were not spherically symmetric and the orientation of the deuterium atoms could be discerned from the map for some of the water molecules that had the lowest temperature factors. While deuterium positions are included in the final model for all water molecules, most of them were placed on the basis of probable hydrogen bonds and, while they remained rather stable during refinement, we cannot claim that their placement was due solely to the experimental data. Indeed, positions for some deuterium atoms refined to quite unreasonable orientations and the final model has to be viewed with some scepticism in this respect. Forty-four water molecules are found within hydrogen bond distances to the backbone amides or carbonyl oxygen atoms. Of the remaining 19 water molecules, 15 form at least one hydrogen bond to a side-chain amide or oxygen. One water molecule clearly occupies two sites separated by 1.9 A, with occupancies of 0.5 and 0.4. Both sites are within hydrogen bond distance of the carbonyl oxygen of Lys46. Another water molecule (occupancy 0"7) is located only 1.3 A away from the alternative site of the carboxyl group of Glu7. Since the occupancy of this

alternative site is 0"3, we may conclude that the water site is occupied only in the absence of the amino acid side-chain. Additionally, four unfavorable short hydrogen bonds (their lengths vary between 2 A and 2.4 A) may also be explained by partial disorder of the hydrogen bond partners. One peak detected in the solvent region in the final stages of joint refinement remains uninterpreted, even though it is placed in the co-ordinate list as an oxygen of water molecule 324. This peak is adjacent to Tyr23 and is located in the plane of the ring. It is also close to the sulfur atoms of Cys30 and Met52. The lack of suitable hydrogen bond partners, the compact shape of the peak and the presence of nearby hydrophobic groups rules out the possibility that this represents a water molecule. We suspect that this peak may correspond to a potassium ion with partial occupancy, but no proof of this assumption can be offered at this time. Comparison of the ordered solvent structures in both crystal forms of BPTI shows that 20 out of 63 ordered water molecules are located at very similar positions (deviation < 1.0 A) and have the same hydrogen bond partners. None of these water molecules was involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the crystal form I, but five of them are so involved in the crystal form II. Also, two oxygen atoms of the phosphate (03, 04) adopt positions close to water sites in the crystal form I. The phosphate oxygen atoms 02 and 03 as well as 04 form hydrogen bonds to Arg20 NH2, NH1 and Tyr35 OH, respectively, whereas O1 hydrogen bonds to Lys41 NZ of a neighboring molecule. In this way, the phosphate mediates a crystal contact. The four "internal" water molecules reported in form I crystals are all present also in the crystals of form II.

High-resolution X-ray and neutron studies of form II crystals of BPTI have revealed a structure that is quite similar to that of form I, although differences exist that exceed experimental uncertainty. One question not really answered by this investigation is the reason why form II crystals diffract so much better than those of form I. Higher limits of diffraction are usually obtained for crystals in which the protein is more tightly packed, as was, for example, the case for triclinic v e r s u s tetragonal lysozyme (Kurachi et al., 1976). The fraction of the unit cell occupied by the solvent was much lower for the former crystal form than for the latter, and thus it was not surprising that the triclinic crystals diffracted much better. Crambin crystals, for which observable diffraction has been reported at a resolution as high as 0.79 A, contains only 29% solvent, which places it at the low extreme of the range (30 to 78%) observed in other protein crystals (Matthews, 1977). Similarly, only 30% of the unit cell contains solvent in the strongly diffracting crystals of the avian pancreatic polypeptide (Wood et al., 1977). Crystals of form II of BPTI, on the other hand, actually contain slightly more solvent than those of form I (380/0 v e r s u s 36°/0). On the other hand, they grow much larger and are usually very well formed, which might account for (but not fully explain) the observed higher diffraction limit.

Joint refinement of the structure of B P T I with the X-ray and neutron data has resulted in a model that has elucidated a number of features t h a t otherwise would remain unclear. An example is provided by the ease of the reorientation of the side-chain of Gln31. The earboxyl terminus of the protein was also a source of considerable difficulty. It is possible t h a t the two residues could have been located eventually even in the absence of the neutron data; nevertheless, no density was found for them in the final map resulting from X - r a y refinement, while it was possible to place them after both types of data were used. The neutron data were particularly useful in locating hydrogen atoms. While a fraction of hydrogen atoms could be placed unambiguously during the refinement of crambin with 0.945 A X-ray data (Hendriekson, personal communication) and as m a n y as 800/0 of all hydrogen atoms were resolved in positive regions of the 1.2 A electron density map of insulin (Sakabe et al., 1981), our experience evaluating the 1 A X-ray map of B P T I was that only relatively few hydrogens could have been assigned unambiguously. This was particularly clear in our evaluation of the methyl rotors, which were very poorly determined in the X-ray map, while quite clear in the neutron map at much lower resolution (Fig. 3). When the method of joint refinement of protein structures with X-ray and neutron data was first introduced (Wlodawer & Hendrickson, 1982), it was postulated that all diffraction data should be collected from identically deuterated crystals. This was not followed in the refinement of B P T I , since only crystals used to collect neutron data were deuterated. Nevertheless, the comparison of the progress of refinement with what was observed in refining the structure of ribonuclease A where all crystals were identically deuterated (Wlodawer & SjSlin, 1983) showed no difficulties due to this effect. This leads us to reconsider this requirement and we no longer assume the necessity of identical deuteration as a prerequisite of successful joint refinement. Information that was derived from the neutron data only led to the assignment of the l l amide hydrogen atoms that were found to be protected from exchange during the course of this experiment. We have previously remarked on the fact that the maximum rate of exchange extrapolated from the neutron data was about three orders of magnitude lower than the solution rate observed under similar conditions of p H and temperature (Richarz et al., 1979). Englander & Kallenbach (1983) discussed the available data for exchange in crystals of several proteins and compared them with the rates in solution. They found large discrepancies between the reported relative rates of exchange for different proteins. On the one hand, there is considerable evidence that exchange rates in lysozyme are almost insensitive to crystallization (Bentley et.al., 1983); on the other, unambiguous slowing of the exchange in the crystals of insulin was observed by Tuchsen & Ottesen (1979). Recalculation of the data of Wlodawer & SjSlin (1982) showed a rate of exchange at least an order of magnitude slower in the crystals, after all other effects had been accounted for. Even larger effects were observed by Kossiakoff (1982) in his study of trypsin, with a difference of several orders of magnitude between the rates of exchange in crystals and in solution. The latter results are in the best agreement with our observations for BPTI.

A complicating factor in our interpretation of the markedly slower rates of exchange, as being due to crystal forces, is the presence of polyethylene glycol in the solution surrounding the crystal. The osmotic pressure of 30~o P E G 20,000 is of the order of ten atmospheres (1 atm = 101,325 Pa) and thus the activity of water inside the crystal is also lowered. It is unlikely, though, that this could explain any significant part of the observed effect. Differences of actual rates notwithstanding, the agreement between the assignment of protected amides derived in this study is in remarkably good agreement with the results obtained by two-dimensional n.m.r. I t is quite clear t h a t if the experiments were to be performed in the reverse order, the availability of the neutron diffraction data could have made the task of assignment of n.m.r. resonances considerably easier. We are in complete agreement with Wagner (1983) about the relative merits of both techniques. Neutron diffraction results are more direct and easier to obtain for larger proteins, while n.m.r, is much better suited for collecting titration data as a function of parameters such as pH, temperature: pressure, etc. We can only hope that these two techniques will be combined more often for the studies of such problems in the future (Cohen & Wlodawer, 1982; Bentley et al., 1983).
