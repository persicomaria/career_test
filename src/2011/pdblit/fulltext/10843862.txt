Investigation of the Interaction between the Class I MHC-Related Fc Receptor and its lmmunoglobulin G Ligand
Malini Raghavan," Marcus Y. Chen,* Louis N. GastineltS, and Pamela J. Bjorkmant *Division of Biology 156-29 tHoward Hughes Medical Institute California Institute of Technology Pasadena, California 91125 ter and Rees, 1985). The extracellular regions of the heavy chains of class I molecules and FcRn share sequence similarity and are organized into three domains, al, a2, and a3, that are anchored to the cell surface via a short transmembrane segment C-terminal to the a3 domain (Simister and Mostov, 1989a, 1989b; Townsend and Bodmer, 1989). Despite their structural similarity, class I MHC molecules and FcRn function very differently in immune recognition. Class I molecules bind peptides derived from self and foreign proteins and present them to cytotoxic T cells (Townsend and Bodmer, 1989). Stable cell surface expression of class I molecules depends upon the binding of peptides during transit through the endoplasmic reticulum (Townsend et al., 1989; Ljunggren et al., 1990; Schumacher et al., 1990). There is no known role of peptides in the binding of FcRn to its IgG ligand, and purified preparations of FcRn do not contain bound peptide (Raghavan et al., 1993). FcRn has been predicted to fold into a three-dimensional structure resembling that of class I molecules (Simister and Mostov, 1989a, 1989b; Gastinel et al., 1992). Crystallographic studies of class I molecules showed that the a3 and Pnrn domains resemble immunoglobulin constant domains and pair with each other, while the al and a2 domains form a platform of eight antiparallel j3 strands topped by two long a helices (Bjorkman et al., 1987a, 1987b; Garrett et al., 1989; Madden et al., 1991; Fremont et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992). A groove between the helices constitutes the binding site for short (eight or nine residue) peptides (Bjorkman et al., 1987a, 1987b; Garrett et al., 1989; Madden et al., 1991; Fremont et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992). The T cell receptor is thought to interact simultaneously with class I residues on the top surface of the al and a2 domains and with exposed portions of the peptide (reviewed by Bjorkman and Parham, 1990). Conserved residues in a negatively charged loop within the a3 domain of the class I molecule have been mapped as the main site of interaction with the CD8 coreceptor (Connolly et al., 1988; Potter et al., 1989; Salter et al., 1990). Although structural, genetic, and biochemical studies have led to a significant understanding of class I molecules and their interactions with peptides and T cell proteins, little information was available about the molecular details of the FcRn-IgG interaction prior to this report. The goal of these studies was to gain a better understanding of the FcRn-IgG complex, in particular of the mechanistic basis of the observed pH-dependent binding betwean FcRn and IgG, and also to investigate whether there were any parallels between the FcRn-IgG interaction and class I interactions with peptides or macromolecules. Since the pK, of imidazole side chains of histidines usually falls within the pH range of 6.0-7.0, the pH dependence of the FcRn-IgG interaction has been suggested to involve histidine residues either directly at the interaction site (Parham, 1989; Simister and Mostov, 1989b) or indirectly by causing astructural transition to a nonbinding state of FcRn (Raghavan et al., 1993). To investigate these

Summary The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is structurally similar to class I major histocompatibility molecules. FcRn transports maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) from ingested milk into the blood. IgG is bound at the pH of milk (pH 6.0-6.5) in the gut and released at the pH of blood (pH 7.5). We find that alteration of a histidine pair within the a3 domain of FcRn and of a nearby loop (the FcRn counterpart of the class I CDB-binding loop) affects the affinity for IgG. Inhibition studies suggest the involvement of the FcRn Brmicroglobulin domain in IgG binding. Fragment B of protein A inhibits FcRn binding to IgG, localizing the binding site on Fc for FcRn to the C&2-C&3 domain interface. Three histidines present at the Cn2-CH3 domain interface of Fc could be partially responsible for the pH-dependent interaction between FcRn and IgG. Introduction The immune systems of fetal and newborn mammals are not fully developed for defense against foreign agents. Thus, acquisition of passive immunity from maternal immunoglobulins is important for the immune response during the first few weeks of life (Brambell, 1970; Johnson and Matre, 1979). ,Mammals acquire maternal immunoglobulins by direct placental transfer in utero (Johnson and Matre, 1979), and also from ingested milk or amniotic fluid (Brambell, 1970; Rodewald and Kraehenbuhl, 1984). In suckling rats, a receptor on intestinal epithelial cells binds and transports maternal immunoglobulins from milk into the circulation of the newborn (Rodewald and Kraehenbuhl, 1984; Simister and Rees, 1985; Israel et al., 1993). This receptor, FcRn, is specific for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Jones and Waldman, 1972) and isolated Fc fragments of IgG bind to the receptor. The interaction of FcRn with IgG is markedly pH dependent, with IgG being bound at the pH of milk (pH 6.0-6.5) and released at the pH of blood (pH 7.0-7.5) thus ensuring efficient unidirectional transport (Rodewald, 1976). FcRn is a heterodimer composed of a membrane-bound heavy chain attached noncovalently to (32-microglobulin &m), the same light chain that associates with class I major histocompatibilitycomplex(MHC)molecules(Simis-

possibilities, we carried out mutagenesis studies of histidine residues unique to FcRn. The extracellular portion of the heavy chain of rat FcRn contains six histidine residues @mister and Mostov, 1989a, 1989b) at positions 10, 168, 237,250,251, and 263. The histidine at position 263 would contribute to the structural stability of the immunoglobulin domain fold, and is an almost completely conserved feature of immunoglobulin constant domains (Kabat et al., 1991) as well as class I a3 domains (Bjorkman and Parham, 1990). This histidine is therefore unlikely to be involved in specific FcRn functions. Of the remainder, three (positions 168, 250, and 251) are predicted to be at least partially solvent accessible and the other two (positions 10 and 237) are at the interface between the heavy chain and Pnrn, based upon the class I crystal structures (Bjorkman et al., 1987a, 1987b; Garrett et al., 1989; Madden et al., 1991; Fremont et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992). We report here that alteration of the histidine pair in the a3 domain (residues 250 and 251) results in an FcRn molecule with reduced affinity for IgG, but that retains pHdependent binding. FcRn residues 250 and 251 are predicted to be located on a loop in three-dimensional proximity to the loop in class I molecules that is believed to be the principal CD8 recognition site (Salter et al., 1990). To test whether there are parallels between the recognition of IgG by FcRn and CD8 by a class I molecule, we constructed a mutant FcRn molecule in which six amino acids (residues 219-224) in the counterpart of the CD&binding loop were replaced by the corresponding residues found in a class I sequence. We find that the binding affinity of this mutant FcRn is diminished only slightly compared to the wild-type receptor. This result suggests that residues 219-224 of FcRn are located at the FcRn-IgG interface, but that this loop is unlikely to play a dominant role in IgG binding, unlike the analogous loop in class I molecules that exerts a major effect on the CD8-class I interaction. We also have evidence to suggest that residues in the ppm domain of FcRn interact with IgG. Support for the

involvement of the Pnrn domain comes from inhibition studies using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against FcRn heterodimers to test for blocking of the pHdependent FcRn-IgG interaction. We find a MAb that recognizes free rat j&m and &rn complexed with the FcRn heavy chain inhibits IgG binding to FcRn. A second MAb reactive with rat Prim was also found to inhibit IgG interaction with FcRn. These results provide a first map of the mode of recognition of IgG by FcRn, suggesting that the binding site is distinct from the counterparts of the class I peptide and T cell receptor sites. To investigate the possible involvement of histidine residuesof Fc in influencing the pH-dependent FcRn-Fc binding interaction, we sought to localize the binding site on Fc for FcRn, which had not previously been studied. Here we use blocking experiments to show that the binding site on Fc for FcRn and for fragment 5 of protein A overlap. The crystal structure of an Fc-fragment B complex shows that fragment B binds to the interface between the Ct,2 and CH3 domains of Fc (Deisenhofer, 1981), implying that the FcRn-binding site OR Fc includes this region. A cluster of histidines on Fc are present at the fragment B-binding interface, which could be partially responsible for the pHdependent interaction between FcRn and IgG.

Results Identification of FcRn Residues that Affect IgG Binding Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) in a truncated form of the rat FcRn heavy chain gene in which a stop codon was inserted after the codon for amino acid 269. This truncated heavy chain pairs with a lipid-linked rat P2m-decay-accelerating factor fusion protein (j&m-DAF; see Experimental Procedures) when the genes for both proteins are transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and the heterodimer binds IgG with the known physiological pH dependence (Gastinel et

Columns 1-3 list the mutants constructed, the observed expression levels, and predicted location of mutation sites based upon the class I crystal structure. In the histidine mutants, all heavy chain histidines in FcRn were replaced by the corresponding residues found in the murine class I molecule H2-Ld, with the exception of His-168, which was replaced by an alanine rather than the bulky side chain of a tyrosine residue that is conserved at this position in class I sequences. In the CD8 mutant, residues 219-224 of the FcRn heavy chain were changed from the sequence LASGSG to EDQTQD, the corresponding residues found in the human class I molecule HLA-AP. In the RGD mutant, FcRn heavy chain residues 246-248 were changed from the sequence RGD to SGE, the corresponding residues found in HLA-B. Average dissociation constants (KD) derived from Scatchard analyses (Figures 3A-3C) of the binding of `? IgG to cells expressing mutant and wild-type receptors are listed in column 5 along with the number of independent experiments that were performed to compute the average in parentheses. The ratio of the KD of the mutant to the K. of the wild type is listed in column 6 for results from the cell binding assays, and in column 7 for two of the mutants whose K. were also determined by a SPR assay (Figures 4A and 48).

al., 1992). The use of the truncated heavy chain+m-DAF heterodimer ensures that only those mutant heavy chains that are properly folded and associated with Pnrn will be detected at the cell surface. Specific mutants that were constructed are listed in Table 1 and their positions on the structure of aclass I MHC molecule (here representing FcRn) are shown in Figure 1. His-lo, His-237, His-250, and His-251 were changed to the corresponding residues found in the murine class I molecule H2-Ld, while His-l 68 was changed to alanine rather than the tyrosine found in class I sequences. The anti-F&n heavy chain MAb 1 G3 (see Experimental Procedures) was used to assay transfected CHO cell lines for surface expression of FcRn. Figures 2A and 28 show flow cytometric analyses of the expression levels of cells transfected with wild-type-, Hl68A-, H2370, or H250Q-H251 N-truncated FcRn heavy chain genes, demonstrating that alterations of these FcRn histidines do not interfere with Pzrn association or cell surface expression. All three mutants bind IgG in a pH-dependent manner, established by flow cytometric analyses of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled IgG binding at pH 6 and pH 8 (data not shown), as previously demonstrated for the wild-type protein (Gastinel et al., 1992). We have not been able to detect surface expression of the HlOF mutant in four separate transfections, and assume

that this mutation affects pairing with Pnrn as suggested by its location at the al aP+m domain interface (see Figure 1). The binding of `*Y IgG to cells expressing wild-type or mutant proteins was compared at pH 6.0 by Scatchard analysis (Figures 3A and 3s) and the derived dissociation constants are listed in Table 1. The H2500-H251 N mutant shows a reduction in binding affinity for IgG of about 6-fold (Ko = 43.8 +- 2 nM; Figure 3A) compared with the wild type (KD = 7.8 f 4 nM) and the Hl68A (K. = 5.2 f 1 nM; Figure 3A) and H237Q mutants (Ko = 6.3 nM; Figure 38). We next sought to identify other regions in three-dimensional proximity to residues 250 and 251 that could influence IgG binding affinity. Immediately preceeding residues 250 and 251 in the primary sequence of FcRn is an RGD sequence (residues 246-248), which is believed to serve as an adhesion recognition sequence in cell adhesion molecules (Hynes, 1990). To assess the importance of this sequence in FcRn binding to IgG, the RGD sequence was changed to SGE, corresponding to the sequence of the analogous residues in human class I HLA-B molecules (Bjorkman and Parham, 1990). Based upon the class I three-dimensional structure (see Figure 1), the FcRn loop containing His-250 and His-251 should also be

Histidines unique to FcRn are labeled with their residue number (in FcRn numbering); the loop of sequence LASGSG (the counterpart of the class I loop implicated in binding to CD8; Connolly et al., 1988; Potter et al., 1989; Salter et al., 1990) is labeled as CD8 loop, and the RGD sequence loop is labeled as RGD loop.

spatially proximal to the counterpart of the loop that plays a dominant role in the interaction of class I molecules with CD8 (Connolly et al., 1988; Potter et al., 1989; Salter et al., 1990). The N-terminal portion of this loop (residues 219-224 in FcRn, sequence LASGSG) was altered by sitedirected mutagenesis to encode the residues found at the analogous positions in the class I molecule HLA-A2 (residues 222-227, sequence EDQTQD). FcRn residues 225 and 226 were unaltered as these residues constitute part of a potential N-linked glycosylation site (residues 225227, sequence NCS). The cDNAs for heavy chains that were altered at the RGD sequence and the counterpart of the CD8 interaction site (hereafter referred to as the RGD and CD8 mutants, respectively) were transfected into CHO cells along with the P2m-DAF gene, as described for the histidine mutants. The RGD mutant was expressed at the surface of tran8feCted cells at levels comparable to the wild-type FcRn heterodimer, while the CD8 mutant was initially ex-

pressed at comparable levels, but consistently lost surface expression with passage (Figure 2C). Scatchard plots for lz51 IgG binding to cells expressing these mutants or the wild-type FcRn are shown in Figure 3C. Mutation of the RGD sequence has little effect on the affinity of FcRn for IgG. The measurement of the affinity of the CD8 mutant was complicated by the instability of this transfected cell line. Nevertheless, this mutation appears to result in a reduction in affinity (Table l), although the value of the affinity constant determined from multiple experiments showed a large spread of error. As an independent verification of the reduction in binding affinity of the H250Q-H251 N and CD8 loop mutants, and because of the difficulties in determining an accurate binding constant for the CD8 mutant, we derived equilibrium constants for the interaction between IgG and purified soluble wild-type or mutant receptors using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay (FBgerstam et al., 1992; Malmqvist, 1993). Mutant or wild-type FcRn was released from transfected cells expressing the heavy chain+mDAF heterodimers by treatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Binding was assayed by SPR measurements of the interaction of purified mutant or wild-type FcRn with a biosensor chip to which rat IgG had been immobilized, and binding affinities were determined by Scatchard analyses (Figure 4). The ratio of the K. for the H250Q-H251 N mutant to the KD of the wild-type protein again shows that the mutant has a reduced binding affinity of 6- to 7-fold (KI, of the mutant = 346.0 -c 15 nM; KD of the wild type = 53.7 + 5 nM; Figure 4A; Table 1). For the CD8 mutant, we see only a P-fold reduction in the affinity compared with the wild-type protein (KD of mutant = 125.0 + 2.5 nM; KD of wild type = 53.7 f 5 nM; Figure 48; Table 1). Although the affinity difference for the CD8 mutant is small, it is reproducible, and correlates with the observation of a reduced affinity for this mutant using the cell binding assay. Because of the instabilityof the CD8 mutant cell lines, the binding affinitydetermined by the cell binding assay is likely to be less accurate than that determined by the SPR assay, which uses equivalent amounts of purified mutant and wild-type proteins. The differences in the absolute values for the Kas determined in the SPR assay from those determined using the cell binding assay probably reflect the different techniques, the use of soluble rather than membrane-bound FcRn, or a combination of the two. This range of difference has been observed by others comparing SPR-based assays versus radioimmunoassays for derivation of binding constants (Cunningham and Wells, 1993). Indeed, in our case, when the SPR assay is conducted in the reverse orientation (wild-type FcRn immobilized on the biosensor chip, binding of soluble IgG is assayed), the K. value for the binding affinity of IgG is closer the K. derived from the cell binding experiments (K. = 12 nM, SPR assay, M. R. and P. J. B., unpublished results; compared with K. = 7.8 nM, cell binding assay).

the pH-dependent binding of IgG to FcRn. In particular, we investigated whether antibodies against the 8?rn domain of FcRn could interfere with ligand binding, since alteration of residues in the neighbouring a3 domain of FcRn affected the binding affinity for IgG. One of the MAbs generated (4C9) reacts with free Bnrn and with j3*rn complexed with the FcRn heavy chain. A second previously described antibody (2BlOCll; the gift of L. Lodgberg) has similar recognition properties (Gastinel et al., 1992). These two MAbs and other MAbs against unknown epitopes in the FcRn heterodimer were assayed for their ability to inhibit the pH-dependent binding of IgG to FcRn. Cells expressing wild-type FcRn heavychain+m-DAFcomplexes were preincubated at pH 8.0 with a j3*rn- or FcRn-specific MAb or with an irrelevant MAb. Flow cytometric analysis was then used to assay FcRn-expressing cells for the binding of FITC-labeled rat IgG at pH 6.0 or pH 8.0. Cells pretreated with 4C9 or 2BlOCll show complete blocking of IgG binding at pH 6.0 (Figures 5C and 5D), whereas ceils pretreated with the irrelevant MAb show no blocking compared with cells receiving no pretreatment (Figure 5A). The MAb 2G3 against an epitope involving the bottom of the FcRn a3 domain and possibly the Bern interface (see Experimental Procedures), and the MAbs 40 1 and 1G3 against unknown epitopes in the FcRn heterodimer showed partial blocking of IgG binding (Figures 5E, 5F, and 5B). Fragment B of Protein A Inhibits IgG Binding by FcRn The binding site on Fc for the 8 kDa fragment B of protein A is known from the crystal structure of an Fc-fragment B complex (Deisenhofer, 1981). Fragment B binds to the interface between the CH2 and c1.13domainsof Fc, making contacts with the bottom of the CH~ domain and the top of the CH3 domain (Figure 6). We tested the ability of a genetically engineered functional analog of fragment B (the 2 domain; Nilsson et al., 1987) to block binding of FcRn to IgG using a SPR assay (Figure 7). Human IgG, which binds to rat FcRn in the same pH-dependent manner as rat IgG (Wallace and Rees, 1980) was immobilized on the biosensor chip (human IgG was used, as protein A does not bind to rat IgG). The interaction of soluble FcRn (2.3 uM) was assayed at pH 6.0 by monitoring the change in resonance units (RU) (Figure 7A). After complete dissociation of FcRn, 2.2 PM 2 domain was injected onto the chip, and binding to the immobilized IgG was indicated by an appropriate change in RU. After dissociation of the

The binding of FITC-labeled rat IgG at pH 6.0 was analyzed by flow cytometry subsequent to pretreatment of cells at pH 8.0 with an irrelevant antibody (B27Ml) or with MAbs against the FcRn heterodimer (iG3,2G3, and 4C11) and against p,m (4C9 and 2BlOCll) (bold line).

such that the presence of equimolar amounts of F&n and the Z domain in the injection mixture resulted in greater than 50% inhibition of FcRn binding to the immobilized IgG (Figure 7A). Complete inhibition of FcRn binding to IgG was observed in the presence of a 1O-fold molar excess of the Z domain (Figure 78). By contrast, no inhibition of FcRn binding to immobilized human IgG was observed using a IO-fold molar excess of an irrelevant protein, cytochrome c (data not shown). The ability of the functional analog of fragment B of protein A to inhibit FcRn binding to IgG suggests that the interface between the CL2 and C&3 domains of Fc makes up part of the binding site on Fc for FcRn. To test whether isolated CH3 domain dimers (the pFc' fragment) can form stable interactions with FcRn, we used a pFc' fragment of human IgG expressed as a secreted protein in Escherichia coli in binding and inhibition assays. 6~3 domain dimers did not bind to a biosensor chip to which FcRn had been immobilized, and no inhibition of FcRn binding to immobilized rat IgG was observed in the presence of a 150-fold

The immune system employs a number of Fc receptors in the binding of immunoglobulins, the transport of them, or both. One of these receptors, FcRn, shows significant sequence similarity to class I MHC molecules in its heavy chain, and forms a heterodimer with f&m, the class I light chain (Simister and Flees, 1985; Simister and Mostov, 1989a, 198913). We have recently verified that the crystal structure of the FcRn heterodimer shows the Same domain arrangement and overall fold as a class I molecule (W. P. Burmeister, L. N. G., N. E. Simister, M. L. Blum, and P. J. B., unpublished data); thus, the class I structure depicted in Figure 1 represents a first order model of the FcRn structure. FcRn is unique in its structural similarity to class I MHC molecules. Other Fc receptors (e.g. FcyRI,

FcyRII, FcyRIII, FcsRl and the polyimmunoglobulin receptor) are composed of tandem repeats with sequence similarity to immunoglobulin domains (Ravetch and Kinet, 1991; Mostov et al., 1984). The functional significance of the structural similarity between FcRn and class I molecules is unclear. The marked pH-dependent binding and release of IgG by FcRn gave rise to the hypothesis that histidine residues on the receptor, IgG, or both would be present at the binding interface, since histidines usually deprotonate over the same pH range (Simister and Mostov, 1989b). Deprotonation could result in a pH-dependent loss of salt bridges or hydrogen bonds that might lead to release of IgG. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to study the possible interaction of histidine residues of the FcRn heavy chain with IgG. Cell surface expression and pairing of mutant FcRn heavy chains with B2rn was achieved in three mutants in which four FcRn histidine residues were changed to their counterparts in class I sequences or to other resi-

Observed RU are plotted as a function of time (a sensorgram) for various injections onto a biosensor chip with human IgG immobilized to 3000 RU. Before each injection, the sample from the previous injection was allowed to dissociate completely. (A) Sensorgram of an injection of 2.3 PM FcRn (observed response IRobS] = 1279 RU). injection of 2.2 pM 2 domain (f&. = 257 RU), and injection of a mixture of 2.2 PM 2 domain plus 2.3 PM FcRn (L = 533 RU). In a control experiment, no inhibition of FcRn binding was observed in the presence of cytochrome c at concentrations similar to the 2 domain in this experiment (data not shown): injection of 2.2 uM cytochrome c (Rob, = -35 RU) or a mixture of 2.3 uM FcRn plus 2.2 KM cytochrome c (ROD, = 1214 RU; equal to the additive response from separate injections of 2.3 ELM FcRn and 2.2 FM cytochrome c). Injections of the same samples onto a blank flow cell yielded the following responses (data not shown) to be subtracted from the R,, values reported above: 2.3 pM FcRn, Robr = 58 RU; 2.2 PM 2 domain, Rbs = 25 RU; 2.2 PM 2 domain plus 2.3 sM FcRn, Robr = 61 RU; 2.2 WM cytochrome c, Rabs = -36 RU; 2.3 uM FcRn plus 2.2 PM cytochrome are the following: 2.3 PM FcRn, c, Rae = -6. Thus, the net responses 1221 RU; 2.2 gM 2 domain, 232 RU; 2.2 nM 2 domain plus 2.3 PM c, -1 RU; 2.3 PM FcRn plus 22 FcRn, R,, = 472 RU; cytochrome PM cytochrome c, 1220 RU. (6) Sensorgrams of an injection of 2.3 PM FcRn (Rob, = 1279 RU), injection of 22 nM 2 domain (Rob, = 307 RU), and injection of a mixture of 22 sM 2 domain plus 2.3 nM FcRn (Rob. = 443 RU). No inhibition of FcRn binding was observed in the presence of cytochrome c at concentrationssimilarto theZdomainconcentration in thisexperiment (data not shown): injection of 22 mM cytochrome c (RObS = -315 RU; negative response due to buffer differences) or a mixture of 2.3 nM FcRn plus 22 nM cytochrome c (R.IP = 944 RU; the additive response from separate injections of 2.3 pM FcRn and 22 NM cytochrome c). Injections of the same samples onto a blank flow cell yielded the following responses (data not shown) to be subtracted from the R,,, values reported above: 2.3 nM FcRn, Robs = 56 RU; 22 pM 2 domain, RDbS = 68 RU; 22 nM 2 domain plus 2.3 PM FcRn, RObJ = 155 RU; 22 PM cytochrome c, R,, = -349 RU; 2.3 PM FcRn plus 22 PM cytochrome c, R,,, = -320. Thus, the net responses are the following: 2.3 nM FcRn, 1221 RU; 22 pM 2 domain, 239 RU; 22 nM Z domain plus 2.3 NM FcRn, RObJ = 288 RU; cytochrome c, 34 RU; 2.3 sM FcRn plus 22 pM cytochrome c, 1264 RU.

dues. In the fourth mutant, alteration of a histidine residue at the al a2-8,m interface apparently resulted in the inability of the mutant heavy chain to pair with Barn, to reach the cell surface, or both.

Of the histidine mutants analyzed, we found none that completely abrogate IgG binding at pH 6.0, and changes of two of the histidines had no effect on the affinity of the F&n-IgG interaction at pH 6.0. Of these two, His-168 is predicted to be surface accessible and to point into the counterpart of the class I peptide-binding groove (Figure 1). The ability to change this residue without affecting the binding of IgG rules out a model in which Fc interacts in a pH-dependent manner with a histidine within the FcRn ala2 groove. The other histidine, residue 237, is at the interface between the a3 and brim domains, where it could not directly contact a bound IgG, but could trigger a pHdependent conformational alteration of the FcRn heavy chain+m interface, resulting in loss of IgG binding at pH 8.0 (Raghavan et al., 1993). The lack of change in the pH dependence of IgG binding or even in the binding affinity upon alteration of this residue suggests that it does not mediate such a change. The only histidines observed to affect IgG binding at pH 6.0 were residues 250 and 251, located in the a3 domain. Although mutation of His-250His-251 does not completely eliminate IgG binding at pH 6.0, the affinity for IgG is substantially reduced in the mutant FcRn heterodimer compared with the wild-type receptor at this pH (Figures 3A and 4A). Three different crystal forms of FcRn show a dimer of FcRn heterodimers related by a dyad axis (W. P. Burmeister, L. N. G., N.E. Simister, M. L. Blum, and P. J. B., unpublished data). Although soluble FcRn is a monomer in solution (Gastinel et al., 1992) dimerization may be induced by the high concentrations of protein in the crystal. Since the stoichiometry of the FcRn-IgG interaction is two FcRn molecules binding to one IgG (Huber et al., 1993) the FcRn dimer in the crystal could represent the dimeric form of FcRn that binds the Fc portion of IgG. The interface of the crystalline dimer of FcRn heterodimers is formed by the a3 and finm domains, and His-250 and His-251 form part of the contact area (W. P. Burmeister, L. N. G., N. E. Simister, M. L. Blum, and P. J. B., unpublished data). The loss in affinity as a consequence of mutagenesis of residues 250 and 251 could result either because one or both residues directly contact IgG, or because one or both residues stabilize formation of a dimer of FcRn molecules that binds IgG with higher affinity than an FcRn monomer. Whatever the actual mechanism, it appears that in the wild-type receptor, titration of His-250 and His-251 could partially (6- to 7-fold) contribute to the loss of binding energy at high pH. However, this phenomenon alone appears insufficient to account for the overall loss of affinity (>lOO-fold over the pH range from 6.0-7.0; M, R. and P. J. B., unpublished data) upon raising the pH. Therefore, the observed abrogation of FcRn-IgG binding at pH 8.0 may involve additional residues of FcRn, IgG, or both (see below). The counterpart of the loop that in class I MHC molecules mediates interaction with the T cell co-receptor CD8 is in spatial proximity to His-250 and His-251 (Connolly et al., 1988; Potter et al., 1989; Salter et al., 1990). This loop in the FcRn a3 domain is solvent accessible and is not involved in contacts between FcRn molecules in the crys-

tallographically observed dimer. Alteration of this loop in FcRn results in a 2-fold reduction of affinity for IgG at pH 6.0. Comparable small reductions in affinity between human growth hormone receptor and hormone mutants have been reported for residues known to map to the crystallographically determined structural epitope between the two proteins (De Vos et al., 1992; Cunningham and Wells, 1993). The hormone receptor studies suggest a differentiation between a structural epitope (those residues at the intermolecular interface) and a functional epitope (those contact residues that provide the majority of the stabilization energy for the complex). By analogy, our datasuggest that the FcRn counterpart of the class I CD8binding loop is likely to be at the IgG-FcRn interface, but that this loop does not contain the residues that contribute most strongly to the binding energy. By contrast, alteration of an RGD sequence (residues 246-248) that is also in spatial proximity to residues 250 and 251 did not significantly affect the binding affinity for IgG. RGD sequences in proteins containing fibronectin type Ill repeats have been implicated in adhesive interactions with integrins (Hynes, 1990), but the presence of this sequence within FcRn does not appear to have functional consequences for IgG binding. Based upon the structural similarity between FcRn and class I MHC molecules, three candidate regions were proposed as possible binding sites on FcRn for IgG (Simister and Mostov, 1989b): the counterpart of the class I peptide binding site, presumably accomplished by inserting a loop region of Fc into the putative FcRn groove; the binding site for T cell receptor, i.e., the tops of the al and a2 helices; or the loop in the a3 domain containing the counterpart of the class I residue 227 that is implicated in CD8 binding (Connolly et al., 1988; Potter et al., 1989; Salter et al., 1990). The mutagenesis results reported here suggest that the IgG binding interface with FcRn includes the bottom of the a3 domain. Our data also suggest that residues in the p,m domain play a role in IgG binding by FcRn, as two different MAbs specific for Prim completely block PM-dependent binding of a rat IgG. These results exclude models in which the FcRn-IgG interaction is similar to interactions of class I molecules with peptides or T cell receptors, in that an Fc contacting &rn could not simultaneously reach the tops of the helices on the al and a2 domains or the groove between them, since &rn is located underneath the al and a2 domains (Figure 1). However, given that FcRn and Fc are roughly the same length, contacts by Fc within the FcRn al and a2 domains are not ruled out and, in fact, might be expected. Such contacts would be limited to the side of the ala2 domain platform; e.g., involving loops connecting 8 strands to each other or to the helices. The strongest parallel between the FcRnIgG interaction and class I interactionswith another macromolecule is the class I-CD8 interaction, but only in that CD8 interacts with residues on the bottom of the class I a3 domain. The binding of CD8 to the a3 domains of class I molecules and the interaction of the Fc portion of IgG to the a3 domain of FcRn can be superficially similar at best, as CD8 and Fc have very different three-dimensional structures(Leahyet al., 1992; Deisenhofer, 1981)and alteration

of the FcRn counterpart of the class I loop identified as the main site of CD8 interaction only slightly reduces the binding affinity of the mutant FcRn for IgG. Competition studies reported in this paper serve to localize the site on Fc that interacts with FcRn. The inhibition of FcRn binding to IgG by a functional analog of fragment B of protein A (Nilsson et al., 1987) suggests that the binding site for FcRn and fragment B on Fc overlap. Since fragment B is a small polypeptide (8 kDa) whose interaction with Fc has been characterized structurally (Deisenhofer, 1981; Figure 6), the inhibition data suggest that the FcRn-binding site on Fc involves the bottom of the CH2 domain and the top of the CH3 domain. There are three histidines on Fc at the fragment B-binding interface (residues 310,433, and 435, highlighted on Figure 6) that could be partially responsible for the pH-dependent iinteraction between FcRn and Fc. To assay the relative contributions from the Fc CH2 and C&3 domains, we tested tlhe binding of isolated CH3 domain dimers (the pFc'fragment) to immobilized FcRn and the ability of the CH3 domains to block the FcRn-IgG interaction. The crystal structure of the pFc' fragment shows that the isolated CH3 domains dimerize to form the same structure in the absence of the C&2 domains as they do when part of the Fc fragment (Phizackerley et al., 1979). The observed lack of ~Fc'fragment interaction with FcRn implies that the CH3 domains alone are either unable to bind to FcRn in the absence of the CH2 domains, or have a very reduced affinity compared with the Fc fragment, suggesting that the FcRn-binding site on Fc includes contributions from both CH2 and CH3. An interesting parallel to these results are studies mapping the interaction between the FcsRl receptor a.nd the Fc fragment of IgE to the N-terminal portion of the Fc C&3 domain and the Cs2-C&3 interface (Beavil et al., 1993; Helm et al., 1988). Taken together, these results suggest that His-250 and His-251 of FcRn, as well as His-310, His-433, and His-435 of Fc are likely to contribute to pH-dependent binding in the Fc receptor-IgG complex. The results reported in this paper also suggest that the pgm domain and the side of the a3 domain of FcRn, as opposed to the top of the ala2 domain platform, interact with the side of Fc. Additional mutagenesis studies of residues within f3*rn or along the side of the ala2 domain platform, coupled with results of the ongoing structure determination of crystals of an FcRn-Fc complex (Huber et al., 1993) should increase our understanding of this receptor-ligand interaction, and perhaps shed further light on the evolutionary relationship between FcRn and class I MHC molecules.

Adjuvant was purchased from Ribi ImmunoChem Research (Hamilton, Montana). HL-1 murine myeloma cells were from Ventrex (Portland, Maine). Y (specific activity - 100 mCi/ml) was obtained from Amersham in the form of sodium iodide. PD-IO columns were purchased from Pharmacia. Recombinant phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C was purified from transformed bacteria (Koke et al., 1991), the gift of Drs. J. A. Koke and 0. H. Griffith (University of Oregon). N-ethylN'-(3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), ethanolamine, and BlAcore surfactant P20 were obtained from Pharmacia Biosensor. Purified Z domain, a functional analog of fragment B of protein A (Nilsson et al., 1987), was the gift of Dr. R. Kelley, Genentech. CH3 domains (the pFc' fragment) of human IgG were expressed as a secreted protein in E. coli (P. Carter, unpublished data), and were the gifi of Dr. P. Carter, Genentech. Construction and Expression of Mutants Molecular biological experiments were performed by standard methods (Sambrook et al., 1989). Mutations were introduced into a previously described truncated FcRn heavy chain ending at amino acid 269 that pairs with a lipid-linked version of rat Pzm at the cell surface (Gastinel et al., 1992). The lipid-linked bzrn protein consists of the phosphatidylinositol-anchoring signal of DAF (residues 31 l-347; Caras et al., 1987) fused to the final amino acid of bnrn (b,m-DAF). The cDNA encoding the truncated heavy chain was altered by oligonucleotidedirected in vitro mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) to give the set of mutants described in Table 1. Altered cDNAs were sequenced and subcloned into the expression vector pBJ1 (Lin et al., 1990). Expression vectors carrying the mutant heavy chain genes were cotransfected along with an expression vector (pBJ5-GS ; Gastinel et al., 1992) containing the rat P2m-DAF gene into CHO cells using a lipofectin procedure. pBJ5-GS is a derivative of pBJ1 that carries the glutamine synthetase gene as a selectable marker and means of gene amplification in the presence of the drug methionine sulfoximine (Bebbington and Hentschel, 1967). Transfected CHO cells were grown in a minimal essential medium supplemented with 5%-10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 100 UlmL penicillin-streptomycin, and 25 KM methionine sulfoximine. Afler two to three weeks, populations or clones were screened for heterodimer expression by immunostaining at pH 8.0 with an anti-heavy chain MAb lG3 (see below) coupled to an FITCconjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab'), secondary antibody. The methionine sulfoximine concentration in positive populations or clones was increased to 100 PM and after a further 10 days, high expressing lines were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Cell sorting and analysis was performed on a Coulter Epics Elite flow cytometer using Coulter Elite software, version 3.0. Purification and lodination of a Rat IgG M1/42, a hybridoma cell line secreting a rat monoclonal lgG2a against murine class I MHC proteins (Stallcup et al., 1981), was introduced into a minimouse Cell Pharm cell culture system bioreactor device (Unisyn Fibertec). Ml/42 from supernatants was purified by affinity chromatography on either an immobilized FcRn column using a previously described procedure (Huber et al., 1993) or by thiophillic adsorption on a T gel column according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Purified protein was iodinated using iodobeads. In brief, one to two beads were rinsed in 1 ml of 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.0 (buffer A), dried on filter paper, and added to a mixture of 20 ~1 of `*Y in 180 ~1 of buffer A. After a 5 min interval, 0.5 ml (0.4 mg) of purified Ml/42 was added and the mixture was allowed to incubate for approximately 20 min at room temperature. Excess unreacted 1251was removed by gel filtration using a PD-10 column. Protein fractions were pooled and the protein concentration estimated using a BCA assay. Determination of K. Values by Cell Binding Assays Wild-type or mutant cell lines were grown to confluence in tissue culture plates. Cells were detached by incubation with phosphatebuffered saline (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA for 20-30 min and collected in binding buffer at pH 7.8 (Hank's balanced salt solution, 10 mM HEPES, 0.25% bovine serum albumin). The cells were pelleted, washed once with binding buffer (pH 6.0), and resuspended in binding buffer (pH

8.0) after adjusting their concentration to approximately 3 x 1 O6 cells/ ml. Cells (3 x lo5 to 5 x 105) cells were mixed in duplicate or triplicate assays with labeled IgG, different concentrations of unlabeled IgG, and binding buffer (pH 6.0) to a total volume of 0.5 ml. The samples were incubated for 2-3 hr at room temperature. After completion of the incubations, cells were pelleted for 5 min at 14000 rpm in an Eppendorf microfuge, the supernatants aspirated, and 1.0 ml of cold binding buffer (pH 6.0) added. After pelleting the cells and removal of these last supernatants by aspiration, the tubes were placed in vials and levels of radioactivity were determined using a Beckman Gamma 5500 counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by similar treatment of wild-type CHO cells. The binding data were analyzed using Scatchard plots. At high concentrations of IgG, the Scatchard plots show biphasic behavior suggesting the existence of a high and low affinity state of FcRn, as has been previously described for IgG binding to cell surface FcRn (Wallace and Rees, 1980). Dissociation constant (Ko) values listed in Table 1 correspond to estimates of the high affinity state only. Over the concentration range that we report, the Scatchard plots are linear and there does not appear to be significant contribution from the lower affinity state. Determination of K. Values by BlAcore Analysis Soluble versions of the wild-type, H250Q-H251N mutant, and CD8 mutant FcRn proteins were isolated from supernatants of transfected cells treated with 0.1 pglml recombinant phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Koke et al., 1991). The FcRn proteins were purified on a rat IgG affinity column as described (Gastinel et al., 1992) and concentrated to between 0.08-0.16 mg/ml in 50 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCI, 0.005% Tween 20 (pli 6.0) (buffer 8). A BlAcore biosensor system (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Incorporated) was used for real time binding experiments. This system includes a biosensor element that has a dextran-coated gold surface to which the rat MAb Ml/42 was immobilized using the standard amine coupling chemistry described in the BlAcore manual. Binding of FcRn to the immobilized IgG result in changes in the SPR signal that are directly propotional to the amount of bound protein, and read out in real time as resonance units (RU) (FBgerstam et al., 1992; Malmqvist, 1993). Immobilization of Ml/42 was accomplished by initial activation of the sensor chip with 0.2 M EDC and 0.05 M NHS. The NHS-ester was then reacted with Ml/42 (diluted in 10 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.1) to give to a final absorbance of 0.1 at 280 nm) and the remaining unreacted NHS-ester groups were displaced by 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5). For the histidine mutant experiments, Ml142 was coupled to a final response of 3500 RU, while for the CD8 mutant experiments, Ml/42 was coupled to a final RU of 2200 RU. Different concentrations of soluble wild-type or mutant FcRn molecules in buffer B were exposed to the IgG-modified biosensor element at a flow rate of 5 wllmin. Determination of equilibrium responses at the different concentrations of FcRn permitted a Scatchard type analysis of the data by plotting R,,/C versus R, as described in the BlAcore manual (R, is the equilibrium response at a given concentration C). ELlSAs One hundred pl of purified FcRn (5 pglml) or purified rat Brim (1 pgi ml) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 6.0 were preabsorbed at room temperature to 96-well assay plates. On the day of use, the plates were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.5, 0.1% ovalbumin, 0.1% Tween 20 (buffer C). After extensive washing, the wells were incubated with 50 ~1 supernatant from a MAb secreting hybridoma (see below) for 1 hr. Each well was then washed four times with buffer C, then incubated with 50 ~1 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat F(ab'), against mouse IgG plus IgM heavy and light chains (diluted l/1000). Reactivitywas measured afterfourwasheswith buffer C as absorbance at 490 nm after treatment of antigen-antibody complexes with o-phenylenediamine. MAbs Female BALB/c mice (aged 5 weeks) were primed and twice boosted at two week intervals by intraperitoneal injection of 100 vg of purified soluble FcRn in adjuvant. Serum was screened a week after each injection by ELISA. Three days preceding the fusion, one mouse was boosted with 100 pg purified FcRn in phosphate-buffered saline. Splenocytes from the boosted mouse were fused with HL-1 murine

myeloma ceils, and media from the hybridoma cultures was tested for antibodies against FcRn by ELISA. After subcloning positive clones at clonal density, ascites tumors were produced in pristane-primed BALB/c mice. Four MAbs produced by this fusion were used for the study described in this article: 1 G3, 2G3,4Cli, and 4C9. These antibodies were characterized by their reactivity in an ELISA (described above) against purified FcRn or purified rat f%m, immunoprecipitation of soluble FcRn heterodimers, and staining of transfected CHO cells expressing the lipid-linked version of rat Ptrn (&m-DAF) or three different forms of FcRn. The three forms of FcRn expressed on these transfected cells were the following: truncated FcRn heavy chain paired with 3,m-DAF (denoted as FcRnl below), a lipid-linked FcRn heavy chain (F&n-DAF) paired with unaltered Bnrn (denoted as FcRnP below), and a lipid-linked FcRn heavy chain (FcRn-DAF) whose gene was transfected in the absence of the rat f&m gene (Gastinel et al., 1992). In cells transfected with the FcRn-DAF construct alone, the lipid-linked FcRn heavy chain may pair with endogenous hamster Pnrn or bovine j3*m in the medium (Gastinel et al., 1992). The FcRn-DAF protein consisted of the lipid anchoring signal from DAF (Caras et al., 1987) fused to amino acid 289 of the FcRn heavy chain (Gastinel et al., 1992). The secondary antibody used for cell staining experiments was FITC-conjugatedgoat F(ab'banti-mouse immunoglobulin. Results are summarized in Table 2. Thus, lG3, 2G3, and 4Cll react with the heavy chain of FcRn heterodimers, while4C9 recognizes rat j3*m, either alone or complexed with FcRn heavy chains. lG3 and 4Cll recognize either lipid-linked form of FcRn heterodimer and the FcRn-DAF construct. 2G3 fails to recognize the FcRn heterodimer form in which the heavy chain is attached to the lipid anchor (FcRn-DAF&m) and the FcRn-DAF construct, implying it recognizesan epitope atthe bottom of the a3domain possibly involving the interface with rat Bnrn that is obscured by attachment of the lipid anchor. 2BlOC11, a mouse MAb against rat Bnrn, was the gift of L. Logdberg (Sandoz Pharmaceutical). It had previously been characterized to react with B2m-DAF, soluble FcRn heterodimers, and CHO cells expressing the truncated FcRn heavy chain paired with lipid-linked rat Snrn (Gastinel et al., 1992). B27M1, a mouse MAb that recognizes HLA-B27, was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. Inhibition of FcRn Ligand Binding by MAbs Cells expressing FcRn as the truncated heavy chain paired with lipidlinked p,m (km-DAF) were detached from tissue culture plates as de scribed for the cell binding assays and suspended in binding buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution, 10 mM HEPES, 0.25% bovine serum albumin) (pH 8.0) after one wash with the same buffer. Purified murine antibodies (lG3, 2BlOC11, or the irrelevant antibody B27Ml) were concentrated to 0.3-0.4 mglml and then further diluted 20-fold into a suspension of the FcRn-expressing cells in 0.5 ml binding buffer (pH 8.0). Ascites produced from the hybridoma cell lines 2G3, 4C9, or 4Cll were diluted 1 OO-fold into the cell suspension in 0.5 ml binding buffer (pH 8.0). The concentrations of the MAbs in the ascites were roughly equal (1.5-2.5 mg/ml), as estimated bycoomasie blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels of samples precipitated with protein A beads. After incubation for 1 hour, the cells were washed once with binding buffer at pH 8.0, and again with binding buffer at pH 8.0, before resuspension in a solution of FITC-labeled rat IgG (100 pg/ml) at pH 6.0. Flow cytometric results from these samples were compared with results from cells receiving no MAb pretreatment that were incubated with 100 uglml FITC-labeled rat IgG either at pH 6.0 (positive control) or pH 8.0 (nega. tive control).

BlAcore Analysis of Blocking of FcRn-IgG Interaction by a Fragment of Protein A and by Isolated Fc CH3 Domain Dimers Z domain (a functional analog of fragment B of protein A; Nilsson et al., 1987) inhibition experiments were carried out using human IgG, since protein A does not bind to rat IgG. Commercial human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), which consists of a mixture of different IgG subtypes, has been used for the experiments. Inhibition experiments using Fc CH3 dimers (the pFc' fragment) were carried out using Ml/ 42, the rat monoclonal IgG described above. Immobilization of human IgG or Ml/42 was accomplished by the coupling procedure described above. About 3000 RU of human IgG and 2300 RU of rat IgG were coupled. Different concentrations of the Z domain (2.2 uM and 22 uM) or cytochrome c (2.2 uM and 22 uM) in the presence or absence of 2.3 uM FcRn, were injected onto the immobilized human IgG chip, and the response was compared with the response observed upon injection of 2.3 uM FcRn alone. Identical injections were repeated on a blank flow cell that had been activated with NHS-EDC and blocked with 1 M ethanolamine to estimate nonspecific binding at each concentration. Forthe Ck3domain inhibition experiments, different concentrations of the pFc' fragment ( 3.9 NM, 7.8 uM 15.5 PM, and 31 PM), in the presence 200 nM FcRn, were injected onto the immobilized rat IgG chip, and the response was compared with that observed upon injection of 200 nM FcRn alone. Direct binding of the CH3 domain dimers to FcRn was assayed using FcRn immobilized on a biosensor chip by the amine coupling chemistry. For this purpose, FcRn was diluted into a 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 4.0) to give a final absorbance of 1 .O at 280 nm, and coupling was carried out using the procedure described above for the IgG coupling, such that a final response of 2000 RU was obtained. Injection of a 15 PM sample of the C&3 domain dimers gave a response at the level of background (100 RU after subtracting the response observed upon injection of the same sample into a blank chip that had been activated with NHS-EDC and blocked with 1 M ethanolamine). By contrast, injectionsof a2.9uM sampleof M1/42ontothesame immobilized FcRn chip yielded a net response of 1000 RU. Acknowledgments We thank W.
