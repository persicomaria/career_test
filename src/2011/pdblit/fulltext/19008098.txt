Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of illness and death worldwide. The recent rise of TB is associated with the emergence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).

shown almost 3 log reduction in cfu in lungs and spleen which was significantly lower as compared to control (p<0.001) as well as to actinonin (p<0.01) (Fig. 2). The efficacy of PDF inhibitors in combination with key frontline drugs replacing a bacteriostatic drug, PZA in murine model revealed encouraging results. When BB-3497 was replaced with PZA in three drug combination consisting of INH, RIF and PZA, the profile of cfu reduction for INH, RIF and BB-3497, was found to be similar to INH, RIF and PZA (Fig.2).

Thus, for the first time it has been demonstrated that BB-3497 can serve as a promising antitubercular agent even along with conventional tharapeutics. In summary, this study indicates that PDF inhibitors especially BB-3497 may act as a potential future antimycobacterial agent thus highlighting the need for their further evaluation.
