Cytochrome c3 is a 14 kDa tetrahaem protein that plays a central role in the bioenergetic metabolism of Desulfovibrio spp. This involves an energy transduction mechanism made possible by a complex network of functional cooperativities between redox and redox/protolytic centres (the redoxBohr effect), which enables cytochrome c3 to work as a proton activator. The three-dimensional structures of the oxidised and reduced Desulfovibrio gigas cytochrome c3 in solution were solved using 2D 1H-NMR data. The reduced protein structures were calculated using INDYANA, an extended version of DYANA that allows automatic calibration of NOE data. The oxidised protein structure, which includes four paramagnetic centres, was solved using the program PARADYANA, which also includes the structural paramagnetic parameters. In this case, initial structures were used to correct the upper and lower volume restraints for paramagnetic leakage, and angle restraints derived from 13C Fermi contact shifts of haem moiety substituents were used for the axial histidine ligands. Despite the reduction of the NOE intensities by paramagnetic relaxation, the ®nal family of structures is of similar precision and accuracy to that obtained for the reduced form. Comparison of the two structures shows that, although the global folds of the two families of structures are similar, signi®cant localised differences occur upon change of redox state, some of which could not be detected by comparison with the X-ray structure of the oxidised state: (1) there is a redox-linked concerted rearrangement of Lys80 and Lys90 that results in the stabilisation of haem moieties II and III when both molecules are oxidised or both are reduced, in agreement with the previously measured positive redox cooperativity between these two haem moieties. This cooperativity regulates electron transfer, enabling a two-electron step adapted to the function of cytochromes c3 as the coupling partner of hydrogenase; and (2) the movement of haem I propionate 13 towards the interior of the protein upon reduction explains the positive redox-Bohr effect, establishing the structural basis for the redox-linked proton activation mechanism necessary for energy conservation, driving ATP synthesis.

Functional Cooperativities in a Tetrahaem Cytochrome

Introduction
Many reactions in cellular metabolism involve redox-linked structural modi®cation mechanisms that can regulate electron transfer, enzyme activity (Williams et al., 1997; Poulos, 1996; Modi et al., È È 1996; Tahirov et al., 1996; Fulop et al., 1995; Fukuyama et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1994) and energy transduction processes (Messias et al., 1998; Verkhovsky et al., 1999). A plethora of reactions and processes depend on such mechanisms, achieved by the thermodynamic linkage (cooperativity) between different functional centres (Wyman, 1975), stabilising different protein conformations. The paradigm for the study of cooperativity mechanisms is haemoglobin (Perutz, 1990), for which the molecular basis was established for both homotropic (the in¯uence on the oxygen af®nity of one haem moiety upon oxygenation of other haem molecules), as well as heterotropic cooperativities (the in¯uence on oxygen af®nity upon binding different effectors to the protein). The Bohr effect is an important example in which the effectors are protons (Bohr, 1904). However, there is an important difference when the functional af®nity involves only charged particles. Here, progress has been slower and only recently has it become possible to establish some structural basis for cooperativity (Messias et al., 1998; Luecke et al., 1999). Tetrahaem cytochromes c3 are small (ca 14 kDa) proteins present in large quantities in the periplasm of the sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the family of Desulfovibrionacea. These cytochromes contain four low-spin c-type haem groups (Ambler et al., 1969; Meyer et al., 1971) with bis-histidinyl axial coordination and distinct reduction potentials that are as low as À400 mV (Coutinho & Xavier, 1994). Cytochromes c3 have been shown to play a central role in the energetic metabolism of sulfate-reducing bacteria, working as a coupling protein to hydrogenase (H2 3 2H  2eÀ) (Odom & Peck, 1981; Louro et al., 1997). They can receive the electrons and protons produced by the oxidation of dihydrogen and perform an energy transduction step, activating the protons so that they can be used ef®ciently by ATP synthase. This step is made possible by a cooperative mechanism between protolytic (acidic or basic) and redox centres (redox-Bohr effect). A further positive cooperativity between two of the redox centres allows the concerted transfer of two electrons. The structures of several cytochromes c3 have been studied using X-ray crystallography (Higuchi et al., 1984; Czjzek et al., 1994; Matias et al., 1996; Ä Simoes et al., 1998; Nùrager et al., 1999) and NMR spectroscopy (Coutinho et al., 1992; Salgueiro et al., 1997b; Messias et al., 1998). Thermodynamic properties have been investigated by NMR spectroscopy and potentiometric titrations for some of these cytochromes (Santos et al., 1984; Turner et al., 1994; Park et al., 1996; Louro et al., 1996; Turner et al., 1996; Louro et al., 1997; Salgueiro et al., 1997a; Louro et al., 1998) and also for some site-

directed mutants (Saraiva et al., 1998). Although the reduction potentials of the individual haem groups of the tetrahaem cytochromes c3 are quite different, the three-dimensional structures have shown that the architecture of the haem groups and the general fold of the polypeptide chain is conserved, despite the low degree of amino acid sequence identity (as small as 20 %). Nonetheless, these cytochromes have several common properties: the four haem group display homotropic redox cooperativity, and their redox potentials are pH dependent (Turner et al., 1996; Louro et al., 1998a). These properties give the proteins the ability to work as ``proton-thrusters'', transferring electrons and activated protons in a concerted step within the physiological pH range (Louro et al., 1996, 1998a,b). This increases the rate of hydrogen uptake by the periplasmic hydrogenase, and leads to energy transduction in the absence of a membrane con®nement (Louro et al., 1997). The solution structure of the fully reduced Desulfovibrio vulgaris (strain Hildenborough) (Dvc3) has been determined (Messias et al., 1998), showing that the structural basis for the redox-Bohr cooperativity involves the concerted movement of propionate substituent(s) of haem I and nearby residues Lys45 and Cys46 (Messias et al., 1998; Saraiva et al., 1998). The crystal structure of cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio gigas (Dgc3) in the oxidised state has been determined by X-ray diffraction (Matias et al., 1996) and the microscopic thermodynamic properties are well-established (Louro et al., 1998a). The ®rst haem moiety to oxidise is haem I, followed by haems II, III and IV, numbered in order of the haem binding sites along the sequence of 112 amino acid residues. There is strong positive redox cooperativity between haems II and III and a substantial redox-Bohr effect involving primarily haem I (pKox  6.2 and pKred  8.5) (Louro et al., a a 1998a,b). In order to understand the structural basis for the network of redox cooperativities observed in cytochromes c3, it is essential to obtain high-resolution structures of at least the fully oxidised and the fully reduced states of the protein to identify conformational changes. Comparing the crystal structure of the oxidised state above the pKox (nominal pH 6.5) with a solution structure of a the reduced form is not ideal. Differences may result from the experimental error inherent in each structure, from packing forces in the crystal (Tame, 1999), from the change in redox state, or from the effect of protonation. Also, there are several missing side-chains in the crystal structure and the effective pH is not accurately known. However, the similarity between the crystal and solution structures of the oxidised form adds con®dence to the methods used here. The solution structures of oxidised and reduced form of Dgc3 are presented here. These structures were determined at pH conditions that ensured that both forms were in the same protonation state with respect to the pKa values of the redox-Bohr effect (pH 5.1 and 7.3, respectively). Careful com-

63 with non-degenerate chemical shifts (47.6 %) and 75 out of the 133 NOEs to the fast-¯ipping aromatic residues (56.4 %) were pseudo-stereospeci®cally assigned to one or other side of the ring. The effects of spin diffusion were simulated by complete relaxation matrix calculations and, accordingly, a parameter was set in the program INDYANA to loosen all distance restraints by 6 %. After adjustment for non-stereospeci®cally assigned protons, 1895 lovs and 3841 upvs were generated by INDYANA. This program has the functionality of DYANA and, in addition, optimises the calibration of distance restraints separately for each structure by treating the scaling factors as parameters in parallel with the torsion angles. A total of 67 3JHNHa values was obtained and converted into f torsion angle restraints using È the program HABAS (Guntert et al., 1989). No hydrogen bond restraints were used. The set of experimental restraints was supplemented by 84 ®xed upper limit distances to represent covalent links in the ¯exible haem and proline rings. Functions for calibrating NOE volumes using either the inverse fourth or sixth power of distance were tested. The fourth power gave structures with signi®cantly lower target functions, smaller numbers of violations and improved Ramachandran plots and therefore this was used in all subsequent calculations. An average of 49 NOE restraints per amino acid residue (16 lovs and 33 upvs) and 300 per haem residue (93 lovs and 207 upvs) was used for the ®nal calculation. Since the calibration of NOE volumes is fully automatic, restraints that are redundant in the sense that they do not restrain the protons within the distance limits imposed by covalent geometry cannot be identi®ed until the calculation is complete. For this reason, the NOE restraints presented in Table 1 and Figure 1(a) were converted into distances using the scaling factors of the best structure before analysing them according to the recommendations for the presentation of NMR structures (Markley et al., 1998). The redundancy of the input restraints was evaluated using the program DYANA (Version 1.4) and a Ê cut-off value of 1.8 A for van der Waals contacts: 22.4 % of the upls and 16.6 % of the lols were found to be redundant. The number of non-redundant NOE restraints per residue is shown graphically in Figure 1(a) and detailed statistics of all experimental restraints derived from NMR data are given in Table 1. The number of non-redundant restraints per amino acid residue (including only upls) was found to be 13.2 for this structure, which compares well with the average value of 11.3 found for 97 NMR structures deposited at the PDB up to the end of 1996 (Doreleijers, 1998). Furthermore, this number was determined using every residue in Dgc3, not only well-de®ned residues in the structures (those with both S(f) and S(c) >0.8), and includes only upls, although lower bounds were also used in the structure calculation.

parison of the structures reveals several redoxstate-related changes in conformation, which contribute to the understanding of cooperative effects in this protein.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination for the reduced state Sequential assignment Amino acid assignment was performed using È the classical approach described by Wuthrich (1986), assisted by the use of ring current shifts calculated for the X-ray structure of the ferricytochrome (Matias et al., 1996) as well as the observed chemical shifts for the homologous cytochrome Dvc3 (Messias et al., 1998). Spin systems were identi®ed through analysis of the TOCSY and COSY spectra in 2H2O and H2O at different temperatures, and sequence-speci®c assignment was performed by analysing the H2O NOESY spectra and identifying sequential connectivities. Sequential assignment was straightforward for residues 1 to 16, 18 to 38, 40 to 42 and 45 to 112. The assignment of the remaining residues was complicated by the absence of some of the expected cross-peaks. Residues 16 and 17 are located in a solvent-exposed loop, the resonances are signi®cantly broadened, and the Gly16 Ha to Glu17 HN connectivities were not observed. The HN proton from His39 was not observable in the experimental conditions, probably because the resonance is overlapped with the water signal. Indeed, the HN from the sequence-aligned His35 in Dvc3 has a resonance very close to the water signal (Messias et al., 1998). No signals were identi®ed for Asp43. The chemical shifts assigned in this work con®rm those of the haem molecules and aromatic resonances reported by Picarra-Pereira et al. (1993). Ë In total, 92.0 % of all the protons in this protein were assigned. This corresponds to 98.6 % of the protons after excluding exchangeable protons other than backbone HN. The amino acid sequence found by NMR is in agreement with that deposited at the SWISSPROT database (accession number P00133) except that residue 40 was found by NMR to be a Gln instead of a Asp residue. Structure calculations Assigned cross-peaks in the H2O and the 2H2O NOESY spectra were integrated and converted into volume restraints, resulting in 1648 lovs and 3647 upvs. A further 104 NOEs were predicted from Ê inter-proton distances up to a cut-off of 3 A in preliminary calculated structures; measuring these in both the H2O and the 2H2O NOESY spectra gave rise to 85 new upvs. The preliminary structures were also analysed using the program GLOMSA È (Guntert et al., 1991), modi®ed to take NOE volumes as input, and 59 stereospeci®c assignments were generated out of the 124 stereopairs

ution structure of the protein. Only two consistent Ê violations larger than 0.2 A were found within the ensemble; the full statistics of violated restraints are given in Table 3. Quality analysis of the structures The completeness of the observed NOEs, de®ned as the ratio of the number of experimentally observed NOEs to the number of NOEs ``expected'' from the calculated structures, was assessed using the program AQUA (Laskowski et al., 1996; Doreleijers et al., 1999). When only upper bounds are taken in consideration, the NOE Ê completeness is 26.5 % up to 5 A cut-off distance, which is comparable to the average value found in the literature for the available NMR structures (26 Æ 9 %) (Doreleijers et al., 1999). The structures were superimposed using all heavy atoms. The average rmsd value relative to Ê the mean coordinates is 0.59 A for the backbone a H Ê atoms (N, C and C ) and 0.87 A for all heavy atoms (Table 3). Several regions of the structure are very well de®ned, with backbone rmsd values Ê smaller than 0.5 A (Figure 2(a)) and angular order parameters for f and c torsion angles larger than 0.90. This is the case for residues 3-13, 20-38, 45-57, 62-75, 80-90, 95-102 and 105-111, which are mainly fragments with de®ned secondary structure (helices and b-sheets) or haem-binding sites. The remaining residues are essentially located in solvent-exposed loops and tend to be poorly de®ned, with few NOE restraints, increased rmsds and smaller angular order parameters for the backbone. The average circular variance for the backbone dihedral angles (cvf,c) for well-de®ned residues in

the NMR structures with angular order parameters for f and c torsion angles larger than 0.80 is 0.013 (0.031) and the global pairwise rmsd for the backÊ bone 0.86 (0.29) A, with standard deviations given in parenthesis. These values are within the ranges determined for the 85 multi-model NMR structures deposited at the PDB during 1997 (Doreleijers, 1999) which are cvf,c  0.038 (0.023) and rmsd  Ê 1.2 (0.8) A. The deviation of the backbone torsion angles from ideality is represented by a Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran et al., 1963). Since the repulsive term used in these calculations is too weak to force residues into ``allowed'' regions, the plot is a genuine test of the quality of the structures based on NMR data. The statistics for the family of structures are given in Table 3. The residues falling in the disallowed regions (residues Asp2, Glu17, Asp43, Asp93 and Cys104; none of which are disallowed in more than 50 % of the structures) have few NOE restraints, with exception of Cys104 (Figure 1(a)). The quality of the plot improves if it is restricted to residues that have both S(f) and S(c) larger than 0.9 (Table 3), in which case no residue is found in disallowed regions and only 2.5 % of these residues appear in the generously allowed regions. As observed previously for Dvc3 (Messias et al., 1998), many of the haem ligands do not fall in the most favourable regions, despite having large angular order parameters (all above 0.8). A PROCHECK-NMR analysis of the haem ligands reveals that 50.0 % of these residues are located in the most favoured regions, 43.1 % in additional allowed regions, 6.2 % in generously allowed regions, and 0.6 % in disallowed regions. A similar distribution was observed for these residues in the

X-ray structure (Matias et al., 1996) and this appears to be a typical consequence of haem ligation (Gunasekaran et al., 1996). The ``normality'' of the local amino acid environment in the structures was evaluated using the directional atomic contact analysis (DACA) method (Vriend & Sander, 1993) in the program WHAT IF (Table 3). This method assumes that the average distribution observed in the PDB is representative of the distribution in nature. The average DACA score for the amino acid residues in the best NMR structure was found to be À2.1 which is lower than the average value À1.4(Æ0.7) for NMR structures (Doreleijers, 1998). However, there are four haem groups in this protein and the atomic environment is not typical. In fact, the crystal structures for cytochromes c3 deposited at the PDB Ê have resolution better than 2 A (Higuchi et al., Ä 1984; Czjzek et al., 1994; Matias et al., 1996; Simoes et al, 1998) and yet their Z-scores are below À1.6, which is to be compared with an average value of À0.5(Æ0.4) for high-resolution X-ray structures. The packing quality of the NMR structures was also evaluated with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) (Table 3). The NMR structures for Dgc3 have an average value of 9.2(Æ1.6) bad inter-atomic contacts per 100 residues. This is somewhat higher than the average number of 5.6

(standard deviation 6.7) found for NMR structures (Doreleijers, 1998) but is not surprising because this protein has four bulky prosthetic groups, each with four covalent links to the polypeptide chain, that compel the atoms to adopt less energetically favourable arrangements. A total of 95 hydrogen bonds was identi®ed in the family of 20 INDYANA conformers with the program WHAT IF (Vriend, 1990), 36 of which were present in at least 50 % of the structures. These hydrogen bonds correlate in general with slowly exchanging protons in the 2H2O sample. The NMR structure models for reduced Dgc3 presented in Figure 3(a) are, in general, well de®ned. Some loops in the protein, as well as some amino acid side-chains or haem ligand propionate groups have larger conformational variability, probably because of the reduction in the number of restraints caused by higher solvent exposure. Ring current shifts were calculated for each proton in the NMR structures and compared with experimental values as described in Material and Methods (Figure 4(a)). The overall agreement is comparable with that obtained using the X-ray structure, implying that the structure is of good quality, but there are marked differences that reveal local conformational changes.

The number of restraints per residue calculated using the program AQUA (Doreleijers et al., 1998). The volume were converted into distances using the scaling factors of the best structure. Redundant distance restraints were removed using DYANA and lower distance restraints below the van der Waals radii were also removed. Upper and lower limits from the same NOE were counted as one. Haem - haem and intra haem restraints were excluded from the count. b This number includes both NOE restraints and dipolar shift restraints.

1998b). Six of the exchangeable hydroxyl group protons of the Thr and Ser residues were found (Thr50, 51, 82, 102; Ser 85 and 107). One of the phenylalanine rings (Phe12) is fast-¯ipping, giving degenerate positions for He and Hd protons, but four distinct proton resonances are shown for Phe24. The ®fth proton, Hz, was not assigned due to overlap. In total, 86.0 % of the proton resonances were assigned. This corresponds to 93.0 % of the protons after excluding exchangeable protons other than the backbone HN atoms. Restraints A total of 849 lower volume limits and 1491 upper volume limits was obtained from the 80 ms NOESY spectra. The 25 ms spectra yielded a further 385 lovs and 562 upvs. These were used together with the ®xed upper limit distances as input for the program INDYANA. The initial calculated structures were tested for consistency with the experimental data by checking for interproton Ê distances below 2.5 A for which there were no experimental restraints. Where possible, the volumes at the expected positions of such crosspeaks were measured to provide additional upper volume restraints. This procedure led to 83 extra upper volume restraints for the 80 ms spectrum, giving a total of 1574 upper volume restraints for the 80 ms spectra. Stereospeci®c assignments were obtained using the program GLOMSA. Out of the 125 stereopairs with non-degenerate chemical shifts, 45 were stereospeci®cally assigned and 43 % of the restraints to fast-¯ipping aromatic residues were pseudo-stereospeci®cally assigned to one side

matic improvements are seen for Thr28 and Lys80; these are discussed below. Structure determination for the oxidised state Sequential assignment Assignments were obtained for the 112 amino acid residues and the four haem groups, using a combination of NOESY, TOCSY and COSY experiments at different mixing times. The haem group assignments agree with those published previously and were extended to include 15 of the 16 meso protons and all of the propionate group protons (Louro et al., 1998b). The axial histidine residues experience large paramagnetic shifts and the HN, Ha and Hb protons are shifted down®eld. The positions of the b and a protons were con®rmed by comparison with HMQC spectra (Louro et al.,

or other of the ring. A summary of the restraints used is presented in Table 2 and the number of restraints per residue is shown in Figure 1(b). Initial structures generated without any correction for paramagnetic leakage were used as input for the relaxation matrix calculations. Correction factors were obtained as described in Materials and Methods, and each upper and lower volume limit was divided by its factor. Structures calculated with these corrected volumes were then used as input for relaxation matrix calculations, which gave corrected distances which exceeded the range of experimental restraints with an rmsd of 6 % for the 80 ms data and 7 % for the 25 ms data; these values were used to soften all distance restraints. The function used for converting volumes into distances was chosen after comparing results using the inverse fourth and sixth powers of distance: a family of ten structures with a 13 % range in target function was calculated with each exponent. The fourth power gave a lower target function, smaller maximum lower and upper limit violations, and was used thereafter. Dipolar shifts depend on the inverse cube of the distance from the metal centres as well as the orientation and anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility tensors (Bertini & Luchinat 1986). Thus, they contain important long-range structural information which can be used together with other experimental restraints, such as paramagnetic relaxation (Barry et al., 1971) and nuclear Overhauser enhancements (Barry et al., 1974), or used as restraints in re®nement of structures (Gochin & Roder, 1995). Banci and collaborators (Banci et al., 1996, 1997, 1998; Assfalg et al., 1998) have demonstrated the simultaneous use of NOEs and dipolar shifts in the solution structure determination of paramagnetic proteins. An extension of their approach is used here: the anisotropies of the magnetic susceptibility tensors, as well as the orientation of their principal axes, are optimised for each structure, such that the ®nal family of structures re¯ects the uncertainty in all of the parameters of the tensors. Experimental dipolar shifts were obtained by subtraction of the shifts of the reduced protein

from the observed oxidised shifts, but differences in the diamagnetic contribution to the shifts of the oxidised and reduced form are possible if there are structural changes or changes in the hydrogen bonding network between the two forms. Ring current shifts are the dominant source of diamagnetic shift variations in this protein and the difference in these shifts was calculated for the family of solution structures in the reduced form and for a preliminary family of oxidised structures obtained without using dipolar shifts. Protons for which the difference was greater than 0.2 ppm were rejected from the list of dipolar shifts to avoid systematic errors. Also, since paramagnetic shifts cannot be de®ned unambiguously for protons that are not stereospeci®cally assigned in both forms, those shifts were restrained to lie in the range of the maximum and minimum possible experimental shifts. The shifts accepted as restraints had an absolute mean difference of calculated ring current shifts of 0.07 ppm and a standard deviation of 0.07 ppm: a cut-off of 0.2 ppm was used in the target function calculation such that deviations of less than 0.2 ppm make no contribution. The number of experimental dipolar shifts used per residue is shown in Figure 1(c). The dipolar shifts, together with the NOE data, were used as input for the program PARADYANA (Turner et al., 1998). This program has the functionality of INDYANA as a subset and optimises magnetic susceptibility tensors (the axes and the anisotropies) simultaneously with the torsion angles for each structure. For test purposes, two families of structures were obtained: one with the inclusion of dipolar shifts and the other without. The total of 432 dipolar shifts used includes all assigned protons except for haem groups, haem ligands, and those eliminated as described above. For the two families with a similar target function range the rmsd Ê Ê decreases from 0.92 A to 0.70 A, and the percentage of residues in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot increases by 3.5 % on inclusion of dipolar shifts. Dipolar shifts were included in all calculations thereafter. This family of structures was also used to assign speci®c axial

69 ton-proton restraints in the backbone or sidechains. The average magnetic tensors obtained over a family of structures are listed in Table 4, with the results previously obtained using dipolar shifts of backbone protons and the crystal structure (Turner et al., 2000) included for comparison. Haem II has a lower than average equatorial anisotropy that agrees with the geometry of the axial ligands (Louro et al., 1998b). The structures, shown in Figure 3(b), superimÊ pose with an average backbone rmsd of 0.70 A Ê and a heavy atom rmsd of 1.06 A to the mean structure (Figure 2(b)). For well-de®ned regions (S(f) and S(c) > 0.9) the structures overlap with an Ê average rmsd of 0.48 A for backbone atoms and Ê 0.82 A for all heavy atoms. A summary of the violations of the restraints is presented in Table 3. The analysis of the Ramachandran plot is summarised in Table 3. Inclusion of all relevant residues gave 58.0 % in the most favoured regions, 35.4 % in the additionally allowed, 5.5 % in the generously allowed and 1.1 % in the disallowed regions. Residues in the disallowed region include Ala5, Glu17, Ser64 and Lys95, which have a low number of restraints per residue, but only Ser64 falls in the disallowed region for more than 50 % of the structures. Using only the well-de®ned regions gives 65.1 % in the most favoured regions. The bad contacts were analysed using PROCHECK, which found an average of 19 per 100 residues in the family. A DACA score of À2.3 was calculated using WHAT IF for the best NMR structure (Vriend, 1990; Vriend & Sander, 1993). The number of non-redundant NOE restraints per residue was calculated using AQUA, and the distances obtained with the calibration of the structure with the lowest target function and excluding intrahaem and interhaem restraints (Laskowski et al., 1996; Doreleijers et al., 1998) (see Table 2). Counting only upper limits gave 7.0 restraints per residue and the full set of non-redundant restraints, with upper and lower limits from the same NOE counting as one, gave 13.1 restraints per amino acid residue. Comparison between the solution and the crystal structures of the oxidised state The comparison to the X-ray structure (1wad) for the oxidised cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio gigas is limited to residues 1-111, as the X-ray structure does not include residue 112 (Matias et al., 1996). The positioning of the haem groups in the structures and the haem puckering is very similar. The global rmsd of the mean NMR structure to the Ê crystal structure (nominal pH 6.5) is 1.12 A for Ê for the backbone atoms, which decreases to 0.82 A well-de®ned regions of the NMR structures. Most of the large rmsd values arise from regions which are exposed to solvent and not well-de®ned in the NMR structures. These regions include residues 1-2, 14-20, 40-43 and 91-94. The b-bulge formed by residues 7, 8 and 24 in the NMR structures is not

found in the crystal structure and results in a large rmsd. Residues 60-64 and 104-106 also have a large rmsd, but residue Cys104 is involved in intermolecular contacts in the crystal. Comparison between the solution structures of the oxidised and reduced states This section presents a survey of the differences in the two families of structures for the identi®cation of genuine redox-state-related changes; the changes associated with redox-Bohr cooperativity and with inter-haem cooperativity are discussed below. In order to investigate conformational changes associated only with the oxidation state

and not with the main protolytic group, the solution pH for the oxidised and reduced samples was set below the redox-Bohr pKas (5.1 and 7.3, respectively). The mean structure from each family superimÊ poses with an rmsd of 1.03 A for backbone atoms Ê for all heavy atoms. Using only the and 1.48 A well-de®ned regions in both structures, an rmsd of Ê Ê 0.80 A is obtained for backbone atoms and 1.25 A for heavy atoms. The largest rmsd values are found in the regions 16-20, 41-42, 45-47, 56-65, 7581, 89-95 and 104-106 (see Figure 2(c)). Among these, some regions are ill-de®ned: the loop formed by residues 16-19 in both families, residues 40-44 in the oxidised structures, and residues 39-44 in

the reduced structures. The side-chains of residues Gln45 and Tyr46 are also badly de®ned in the oxidised structures. The overall fold of the two structures is very similar. The positioning of the haem groups and the Fe-Fe distances in each structure show good agreement, although the Fe-Fe distances from both families are slightly longer than those in the crystal structure. The double-stranded b-sheet formed by residues 8-10 and 22-24 is present in both families. Residues 27-30 form an a-helix in the oxidised structures which becomes a composite turn in the reduced structures. In both families, residues 48-50 form b-turns. Residues 63-66 in the oxidised family form a 310-helix which is not found in the reduced form. The segment formed by residues 73-75 forms a g-turn in the oxidised structures and a composite turn in the reduced structures. In the oxidised structures, residues 84-89 form an a-helix which is extended to residue 90 in the reduced structures, and residues 95-99 form an a-helix in the oxidised structures and a 310-helix in the reduced structures. Both solution structures have room to accommodate the Ca2 in a position similar to that found in the X-ray structure of the oxidised state. Calculated ring current and dipolar shifts were used to provide an independent test of the existence of oxidation state dependent changes in the structure (Figure 4). Simple differences in the agreement between observed shifts and those calculated from each family of structures serve to highlight differences in conformation. However, such differences should only be taken as con®rmation of the accuracy of the reduced structure if the ring current shifts ®t best in that case, and as con®rmation of the oxidised form if the dipolar shifts ®t well and they were not used as restraints in the structure calculation. The calculated ring current shifts of Thr28 are in much better agreement with the conformations in the reduced NMR structures than with the oxidised structure (the difference in the average scaled ring current shift error, see Materials and Methods, is 1.02). The orientation in the oxidised NMR structures is less well-de®ned but is essentially the same as that in the crystal structure, and the observed dipolar shifts are predicted better by the oxidised

state structures than by that of the reduced. The dipolar shifts of this side-chain were not included in the structure calculations. It is clear, therefore, that Thr28 undergoes a redox-linked reorientation in solution. Also, the hydrogen bonding is different in the two orientations, with the Og1 of Thr28 forming a hydrogen bond to the axial histidine ring proton in the oxidised form. The breaking of hydrogen bonds in the reduced form may be important in controlling the redox potential of haem III. The side-chain of Asp6 shows a movement associated with that of Thr28: the distance from the Od atoms to the Fe atom of haem I changes between the two families, averaging Ê Ê 11.6 A in the oxidised family and 13.5 A in the reduced family. Its surface exposure also increases from 59.2 % to 83 %. This change may modulate the redox potential of haem I. A similar change in the conformation of the sequence aligned Thr24 was seen previously in Dvc3 (Messias et al., 1998), for which it was suggested that a change in hydrogen bonding involving either propionate 17 or an axial ligand of haem III could be important in controlling the reduction potential of that haem. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on this Thr residue are now being conducted in Dvc3 in order to evaluate the functional effect of this conformational change between the oxidised and the reduced state. There is a signi®cant movement of the backbone of residues 58-65 and 75-81. The side-chain of Lys63 has a different orientation in the two families. This lysine residue is part of a positively charged patch which has been proposed as the docking surface for interaction with coupling proteins, movement of charged residues in this region may modulate the kon and koff rates (Matias et al., 1999). The side-chain of Lys80 also reorientates; the change in ring current (the difference in the average scaled ring current shift error, see Materials and Methods, is 1.62) and dipolar shifts (Figure 4(b)) is dramatic and the analysis clearly supports the different conformations found in the oxidised and reduced forms. This will be discussed in detail below. The side-chain of Ser85, which is close to haem III, is orientated differently in the two families. The

72 Og is able to form hydrogen bonds to residues Thr82 and Cys86 in the oxidised structures, and the hydroxyl group proton of Ser85 was visible only in the oxidised conditions. Breakage of these hydrogen bonds in the reduced structures may be important in modulating the redox potential of haem III. Residues 89-95 show a movement associated with a different conformation of the side-chain of Lys90, which will be discussed below. The sidechains of Lys88, Lys99 and Lys100 adopt different conformations in the families, but they are exposed in both families, and the distance to the nearest haem group is essentially unchanged. However, these lysine residues are part of the positively charged patch, along with Lys63, and movement of the side-chains upon reduction may in¯uence the interaction with coupling proteins. Redox-Bohr cooperativity Comparison between the solution structures of ferro- and ferricytochrome c3 in the same protonation state shows that the conformation of propionate 13 of haem I is redox state-dependent. The two different orientations are clearly seen in Figure 5. The propionate group is more exposed to the solvent in the oxidised state, whereas it is orientated towards the interior of the protein in the reduced. Surface exposure calculations show a large difference for the carboxylic group oxygen atoms (13.0 % in the reduced structure and 25.7 % in the oxidised structures). Interestingly, the exposure in the X-ray structure at nominal pH 6.5, above the pKox  6.2, is even greater (36.7 %). Proa pionate 17 also adopts a different orientation in the oxidised and reduced families but the carboxylic oxygen atoms were found to have a large exposure (>80 %) in both families. The decrease of 2.3 units in the pKa of the protolytic group involved in the redox-Bohr effect (Louro et al., 1998a) is not expected without implying a redox-linked movement of the haem propionate group. The protonated form would also have to be stabilised to shift its pKa well above its value

Functional Cooperativities in a Tetrahaem Cytochrome

in free solution. This is compatible with the low exposure of propionate 13 in the reduced state and its increased exposure in the oxidised state. Furthermore, comparison of the oxidised protein spectra at pH 5.1 with those acquired at pH 7.5 shows that the propionate group of haem I have the largest pH-dependent shifts in the molecule, supporting the proposal that propionate 13 has a pKa in this range and is the group involved in the redoxBohr effect. The proton chemical shifts of methyl groups 2, 7, and 18 of haem I also have the largest pH-dependence among the haem methyl groups. These shifts require only a slight modi®cation of the electronic structure of the haem which is compatible with the ionisation of a propionate substituent. The ionisation of propionate 13 of haem I appears to have more widespread effects. Within the oxidised protein, the largest pH dependent shift among the non-haem resonances was found for Cys49 HN, which increases by 0.5 ppm at high pH values. This suggests the formation of a hydrogen bond between the Cys49 HN and propionate 13 of haem I at a pH above the pKa. Haem I propionates show only a small number of NOEs in the oxidised form, but differences in the NOEs were observed for the propionate group protons at the two pH values which shows that the orientation of the propionate 13 changes with pH as well as with redox state. At low pH conditions, one of the propionate b protons shows a stronger NOE to the Hz and He proton of Phe12 and the propionate a protons show larger NOEs to the methyl 12 group of haem I. At conditions of high pH, one of the propionate a protons shows a larger NOE to the d methyl of Ile10. On the other hand, propionate 17 is highly exposed to the solvent and shows only NOEs to other protons of the same haem group. Altogether, these redox and protonation linked structural rearrangements can explain the redoxBohr effect. In Dvc3, it was demonstrated that propionate 13 of haem I is involved in the redox-Bohr effect by redox linked movements that change its electrostatic interaction with Lys45 (Messias et al., 1998;

73 Ê Ê in the oxidised structures (6.1 A and 7.8 A in the oxidised and reduced structures, respectively). The orientation of haem II propionate 17 in the crystal structure (nominal pH 6.5), is similar to that for the reduced state structures, but the Nz atom of Lys80 is close to the charged atoms of Asp36 and can form a hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group oxygen atoms of Asp36 or Cys37 in the reduced state. In the NMR structure of the oxidised protein there is also a movement of the backbone of Lys80 allowing the formation of a hydrogen bond from Gly78 HN to the carbonyl group of Lys80, which is absent in the reduced form. An analogous rotation of the amide of Gln81 was found in cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio africanus (Nùrager et al., 1999), which is located in a homologous structural region to that of Lys80 in cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio gigas. Movement of water molecules into the space vacated by the side-chain was also observed. Similarly, propionate 17 of haem III was found to reorientate, with the carboxyl group oxygen atoms moving near to the iron atom in the oxidised state, as reported here for the haem II propionate 17 of Dgc3. However, due to the lack of microscopic thermodynamic data for cytochrome c3 from D. africanus, the functional implication of this movement is not clear. The side-chain of Lys90 moves towards the propionate 13 of haem III in the reduced structures, Ê with the positively charged group 2.2 A closer to the oxygen atoms of the propionate group on average. This can be seen clearly in Figure 6. The surface exposure of propionate 13 decreases from 59.6 % to 23.6 % (oxidised and reduced, respectively). The average distance from the lysine residue charged atom to the iron atom is similar in both Ê Ê families (9.6 A and 9.9 A in the oxidised and reduced structures, respectively) and the charged group is highly exposed in both. Although Asp89 also exhibits a redox-dependent conformation, the distance from its carboxyl group oxygen atoms to the charged atom of Lys90 remains similar in both Ê redox states (approximately 8 A). However, several other redox-linked structural rearrangements are observed. In the oxidised structures, Lys90 HN

Saraiva et al., 1998). Although the sequence-aligned residue is a glycine residue in Dgc3, there is an analogous conformational change of this propionate, but there is a different strategy for the redox-Bohr effect in this protein. Indeed, a change in hydrophobicity (Inoue et al., 1992), rather than electrostatic interactions, is supported by comparison with the solution structure of the oxidised form at the same protonation state and data at pH above the redox-Bohr pKa value. A change in the propionate pKa has previously been proposed as an important modulator of haem protein reactivity (Trewhella et al., 1979; Sievers et al., 1983; Leitch et al., 1984). Inter-haem positive redox cooperativity The side-chain of Lys80 is situated between haem groups II and III and moves towards haem II in the reduced form. This is illustrated in Figure 6. As discussed above, the dipolar shifts of the side-chain of Lys80 were not used as restraints but are predicted better by the oxidised structures, and the ring current shifts are best predicted by the reduced structure, con®rming that this is a real redox-state-related conformational change. Surface exposure calculations show that the Nz atom of this lysine residue is 59.4 % exposed in the oxidised state and only 1.2 % in the reduced state structures. On average, the positively charged Nz atom of this Ê lysine residue is 3 A closer to the iron of haem II Ê and 4.3 A closer to that of haem III in the reduced state, thus stabilising the reduced state in relation to the oxidised state. Conversely, the form in which both haem II and haem III are oxidised is stabilised by having this charge moved further away. The movement of Lys80 is coupled with a movement of haem II propionate 17 that brings Lys80 closer to the propionate group in the oxidised form as its side-chain moves away from the haem structure. On average, the Nz atom of the lysine residue Ê is 3.5 A closer to the propionate group in the oxidised structures. The charged atoms of the propionate 17 of haem II are also closer to the iron atom

Figure 6. Haems II, III, Lys80 and Lys90 of the structures closest to the mean for each of the two families (reduced (cyan) and oxidised (grey)). The Nz atom of Ê Lys80 is on average 3 A closer to the Fe atom of the haem II and Ê 4.3 A closer to the Fe atom of haem III in the reduced structures. The charged group of Lys90 is on averÊ age 2.2 A closer to the propionate 13 in the reduced structures.

74 forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen atom of His87, the sixth axial ligand of haem III, whereas a hydrogen bond is formed between Lys90 HN and the carbonyl group oxygen atom of Cys86 in the reduced structures (see Figure 7). In fact, the hydrogen bonding network in this region is quite different for the two families with the following hydrogen bonds present only in the reduced structures: 91 HN Ð 87 O, 92 HN Ð89 O and 93 HN Ð 91 O. This change in the hydrogen bond network is re¯ected in the extension of the a-helix to residue 90 in the reduced structures. These changes along with the hydrogen bond modi®cations resulting from the movement of Ser85 (see Figure 7) may have an important role in modulating the redox-potential of haem III. Thus, the redox dependent conformation of Lys90 and the change observed in the hydrogen bond network is clearly signi®cant, but it could not be observed in the comparison to the crystal structure, since no electron density was obtained for its sidechain. Altogether, the redox-linked conformational changes described here are compatible with the reciprocal interaction (positive cooperativity) between haems II and III.

Conclusions
Proton NMR spectra of reduced cytochrome c3 from D. gigas at pH 7.3 and of the oxidised form at pH 5.1 have been extensively assigned (98.6 % and 93.0 %, respectively, of the protons excluding exchangeable side-chain protons). The amino acid sequence found by NMR agrees with that deposited at the SWISSPROT database (accession number P00133), except that residue 40 was found to be a Gln instead of an Asp residue. Moreover, it was possible to assign the C-terminal Ser residue and the side-chain protons of several residues for which no electron density was seen in the diffraction maps. The solution structure of reduced cytochrome c3 has been solved using the program INDYANA (Turner et al., 1999) which is a simple extension of È DYANA (Guntert et al. 1997), in which the parameters of the calibration of NOE intensities are optimised independently for each structure,

together with the torsion angles, such that the rmsd of the family of structures also re¯ects uncertainties of the calibration. The pucker of proline residues, as well as those of the haem groups, is allowed to vary in these calculations. Finally, the quality of the structures is assessed using standard stereochemical checks as well as their agreement with the NOE experimental data and with the ring current shifts. The solution structure and magnetic properties of the oxidised Dgc3 was solved using NOE intensities from mixing times of 25 ms and 80 ms, dipolar shifts, and angle restraints for the histidine orientation derived from 13C data of the haem resonances (Louro et al., 1998b) with an extended version of INDYANA called PARADYANA (Turner et al., 1998). The NOEs were corrected for paramagnetic leakage and converted into distances automatically, with an additional parameter for the ratio between the two datasets. The strategies used here, based on the inclusion of paramagnetic parameters in the calculations, have made it possible to obtain a solution structure for the oxidised protein of similar precision and accuracy to that of the reduced form, despite the loss of NOE intensity through paramagnetic relaxation. Comparison between the structures of tetrahaem cytochrome c3 in the oxidised and reduced state elucidates the molecular and structural basis for the functional network of positive cooperativities between redox and protolytic centres. Energy transduction mechanisms, resulting from the thermodynamic coupling between different centres explains how cytochrome c3 can maximise the utilisation of the energy liberated by the oxidation of dihydrogen. This involves two separate redoxlinked structural changes: (i) the movement of the positive charges of two lysine residues (Lys80 and Lys90) and the rearrangement of hydrogen bonds, such that reducing haem II and haem III destabilises the oxidised forms, allowing a concerted twoelectron step; and (ii) the movement of the haem I propionate towards the protein interior, increasing its pKred. Thus, the dif®culty in releasing the proa tons from dihydrogen into an acidic medium of the periplasm (Louro et al., 1997) can be overcome: these low-activity protons can be temporarily har-

2 mM in each case. The pH was adjusted to 5.1 for the structure determination (uncorrected pH reading). NMR spectroscopy Reduced state spectra H-NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AMX500 spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm inverse detection probe head with internal B0 gradient coil. The experimental temperatures were controlled using a Eurotherm 818 temperature control unit with a BCU 05 cooling unit. One-dimensional spectra were acquired with a sweep width of 60 ppm (30 kHz) to con®rm that the protein was fully reduced. Assignments were performed using 2D spectra of samples at pH 7.3 acquired at 303 K, but additional spectra were obtained at 293 K and 308 K to help resolve peak overlap. All 2D spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode by the States-TPPI method (Marion et al., 1989) collecting 4096(t2) Â 1024(t1) data points to cover a sweep width of 8 kHz, with at least 32 scans per increment. NOESY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 50 and 100 ms (Jeener et al., 1979; Kumar et al., 1980; Brown et al., 1988). NOESY spectra of the 2H2O sample were recorded with standard pulse sequences with continuous low-power water presaturation during the relaxation delay (at least 1.3 seconds) and the mixing time. NOESY spectra of the H2O sample were recorded with presaturation of the water resonance by a composite 180  inverse pulse followed by a SCUBA sequence to facilitate recovery of potentially saturated alpha protons (Brown et al., 1988). Total correlation spectra were acquired using the clean TOCSY pulse sequence (Bearden et al., 1988; Griesinger et al., 1988; Briand & Ernst, 1991) with spin-lock times of 40 and 60 ms. DQFCOSY spectra were also recorded (Rance et al., 1983; Derome &Williamson, 1990). Raw data were multiplied in the F2 dimension by a Gaussian function with line narrowing of 5 Hz and gaussian broadening of 0.05 and by a pure cosine-squared function in the F1 dimension, except for the COSY spectra, which were multiplied by a pure sine-squared function in both dimensions. The 2D spectra were processed to a ®nal size of 4 k Â 1 k data points, except the COSY spectrum used to obtain the 3JHNHa coupling constants, which was processed with 8 k Â 2 k data points. Polynomial baseline corrections were applied in both dimensions of each spectrum. Data were processed using XWINNMR software (Bruker, Rheinstetten). Proton chemical shifts are referenced to the resonances of the methyl groups in DSS designated at 0.0 ppm using formate as internal reference at 8.475 ppm. Oxidised state spectra A series of two dimensional spectra was recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer at 306.4 K. NOESY spectra (Jeener et al., 1979; Kumar et al., 1980) were recorded with 25 ms and 80 ms mixing times. The short mixing time NOESY, which was used for investigation of crosspeaks to haem resonances, was recorded with standard pulse sequences using presaturation of the water signal and spectral widths of 56 ppm in 2H2O and of 24 ppm in 90 % H2O/10 % 2H2O. A NOESY spectrum of spectral width 22 ppm and a mixing time of 80 ms was recorded for the sample in 2H2O using standard pulse sequences. A large spectral width 25 ms NOESY and 80 ms NOESY were also recorded at a lower temperature (283 K). The 80 ms NOESY was recorded using a sequence with pre1

boured in a less acidic group, ready to be activated upon reoxidation of the cytochrome as it gives electrons to the respiratory chain. As discussed above, although this ``proton thruster'' mechanism is performed by soluble proteins, it is formally similar to that necessary for the proton pumping activity of several transmembrane proteins involved in respiratory chains (Louro et al., 1997, 1998a). As pointed out by Williams and coworkers, the fact that the proteins are in solution is no impediment to the mechanism of redox-linked proton activation, as long as the paths for charge separation leading to phosphorylation are vectorial (Williams, 1961, 1978, 1994; Gao et al., 1992). In sulphate reducing bacteria, charge separation is achieved when the electrons generated in the periplasm are vectorially transferred across the membrane to the cytoplasm where sulfate reduction occurs. The activated protons must remain on the periplasmic side to be used for ATP synthesis. È Recent results obtained by Wikstrom and collaborators (Verkhovsky et al., 1999) showed that during the oxidative phase of the binuclear centre of cytochrome c oxidase, electrogenic protons are temporarily stored in a metastable structure and can only be released upon immediate restarting of the reductive phase of the catalytic cycle. In cytochrome c3, energy conservation can also only be achieved when the correct path for the two-electron redox cycle is completed. This allows cytochrome c3 to work as a ``proton thruster'', performing a redox to proton energy transduction step, that can lead to ATP synthesis (Louro et al., 1998a).

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation Cytochrome c3 was puri®ed from D. gigas as reported by Louro et al. (1998a). The protein was dialysed against distilled water at 4  C and sterile ®ltered. For NMR experiments in H2O, the protein was lyophilised from H2O and redissolved in 92 % H2O/8 % 2H2O. For NMR experiments in 2H2O, the protein was lyophilised once from 2H2O (after incubation at 313 K for one hour) and redissolved in 2H2O (99.96 % atom). The protein was reduced by gaseous hydrogen in the presence of catalytic amounts of the enzyme hydrogenase from D. gigas (LeGall et al., 1982). The pH was adjusted in an anaerobic chamber (Mbraun MB 150 I) to 7.3 by addition of ml aliquots of 0.1 M NaO2H or 2HCl, for 2H2O samples, and 0.1 M NaOH or HCl, for H2O samples. The pH was monitored using a glass electrode (Ingold) inserted directly into the NMR tube. The pH values determined are direct meter readings without correction for the isotope effect (Glasoe & Long, 1960). The ®nal protein concentration was 3.2 mM in each sample. An antibiotic cocktail with 70 mM ampicillin, 50 mM kanamicine and 50 mM chloramphenicol, was also added in order to prevent bacterial growth. The same procedure was carried out as described above for the preparation of the oxidised sample. In this case the protein was dissolved in 90 % H2O/10 % 2H2O and in 100 % 2H2O to make a ®nal concentration of ca

saturation of the water signal by a composite 180  pulse followed by a SCUBA sequence to facilitate recovery of saturated alpha protons, with a spectral width of 22 ppm 90 % H2O/10 % 2H2O (Brown et al., 1988). TOCSY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 75 ms and 25 ms using the clean TOCSY technique (Bearden et al., 1988; Griesinger et al., 1988; Briand & Ernst, 1991). COSY spectra were also recorded (Aue et al., 1976). All the NOESY and TOCSY spectra were processed in a similar manner to that for the reduced state data. Assignment and integration Reduced state È The software package XEASY (Version 1.2; ETH, Zurich) (Bartels et al., 1995) was used to display and annotate spectra and for volume integration of NOESY crosspeaks. The NOEs were measured in the 100 ms NOESY spectra in H2O and 2H2O at 303 K and pH 7.3, crosspeaks involving protons separated by ®xed distances and all intra-haem cross-peaks, except those involving the propionate groups, were excluded. The NOESY spectra at other temperatures were used to con®rm sequential assignments and to determine the ratio of individual contributions to NOEs that were completely overlapped at 303 K but were resolved at 293 K. Integration was performed either by manual integration for isolated peaks or with line-shape integration for overlapped peaks. The baseline around each individual peak (or cluster of peaks) was determined and used to correct the volume. Oxidised state The same software was used for spectral analysis of the oxidised spectra. Several haem resonances had been assigned previously (Louro et al., 1998b). For the integration, cross-peaks involving protons separated by ®xed distances and all intra-haem cross-peaks, except these involving the propionate groups and the thioether groups, were excluded. Once a signi®cant number of other shifts had been assigned, the dipolar shifts were obtained by subtraction of the reduced shifts and used to calculate the magnetic tensors with respect to the crystal structure (Matias et al., 1996). The predicted dipolar shifts were used to indicate possible assignments, a procedure which also helped to extend the assignment of the reduced form (Salgueiro et al., 1997b). Integration of cross-peaks was carried out as described above. Determination of restraints Reduced state Volumes of NOESY cross-peaks that involve exchangeable protons in the spectrum of the H2O sample were corrected for the percentage of 2H2O present. Signals involving Ha protons close to the H2O frequency were taken from the 2H2O spectrum only, except for HNHa cross-peaks. NOE volumes from cross-peaks involving non-exchangeable protons were integrated both in H2O and 2H2O spectra and used to obtain an overall scaling factor relating the spectra (Messias et al., 1998). The volumes were then combined into a single dataset. The minimum uncertainty in any measured volume (dV) was estimated from the intensity of the smallest recognisable peaks in the H2O spectrum and used as input for the program INDYANA (Turner et al., 1999). The

Functional Cooperativities in a Tetrahaem Cytochrome program computes upper limit volumes (upv) as hVi  max(ÁV,dV), and lower limit volumes (lov) as hVi À dV, where hVi and ÁV are, respectively, the average and difference of volumes for each pair of symmetrical cross-peaks. If one peak in a pair could not be measured, its volume is treated as zero. Any lovs with a negative value or with contributions from overlapping protons were discarded. With the exception of prochiral protons and aromatic protons in fast-¯ipping aromatic residues, the most restrictive upv and lov was selected from the H2O and 2H2O spectra. For non-stereospeci®cally assigned protons which both have NOEs to a third proton, the least restrictive of the lovs and upvs is applied to both. If an NOE is observed to only one proton in the pair, the ®xed distance between the protons is used as an offset for the distance obtained from the lov and upv during the target function calculation. Information was extracted from degenerate or completely overlapped peaks by applying the upv to both protons and, for degenerate prochiral protons, also applying one half of the measured lov to one proton only. Some of the peaks treated initially as overlapping were assigned speci®cally when other possible assignments could be eliminated by reference to the preliminary calculated structures. The Hd and He ring protons in fast-¯ipping aromatic residues are a special case of degeneracy because the large distance between them often makes it possible to distinguish which side of the ring is involved. Initially, all the NOEs of degenerate ring protons are treated as non-speci®c, except for one that is chosen to distinguish the two sides of the ring. In the course of the structure re®nement, individual NOEs are assigned speci®cally in a manner analogous to that used for nondegenerate prochiral protons with the aid of the program È GLOMSA (Guntert et al., 1991), modi®ed to use NOE volumes as input. For rings that do not ¯ip rapidly on the NMR timescale, only the strongest NOE was used when separate NOEs were observed to both sides of the ring, since spin diffusion may be accelerated even by slow ring-¯ips. Where possible, f torsion angles were calculated from 3 JHNHa coupling constants using the program HABAS, È with the following parameterisation (Guntert et al., 1989):

Oxidised state Many cross-peaks that were visible in the 25 ms NOESY spectrum disappear at 80 ms because of paramagnetic relaxation. Therefore, all cross-peaks involving haem groups and haem ligands were measured from the 25 ms H2O spectrum. In other cases, integrals were taken from the spectrum in which the cross-peak was more intense, and a separate calibration was used for the two mixing times, with a single additional parameter determining the ratio of scaling factors for each class of peak. Instead of integrating every peak in both spectra, the cross-peak volumes at both mixing times were calculated with respect to preliminary structures to indicate which spectrum was appropriate for each cross-peak. Peaks with intensities predicted to increase by less than a factor of two between 25 ms and 80 ms were measured at both mixing times, and the largest volume was used in each case. In the 80 ms spectra, volumes for nonexchangeable protons were measured in both 2H2O and

Functional Cooperativities in a Tetrahaem Cytochrome H2O. A similar procedure was applied to the two spectra measured at 25 ms (one with a large spectral width and the other with a smaller spectral width). The two sets of integrals (25 ms and 80 ms) were processed separately to convert them into upper and lower volumes using the algorithm described previously in INDYANA (Turner et al., 1999).

Additional restraints Three non-standard residues were used for both structure calculations: fast-¯ipping aromatic residues (Wareham et al., 1995a,b; Messias et al., 1998), ¯exible haem groups (Turner et al., 1998; Messias et al., 1998) and ¯exible proline residues. The ¯exible proline fragment was built by modi®cation of a standard proline residue with the Cb Ð Cg bond removed and the ring closed by superimposition of pseudo-atoms attached to Cb with coordinates corresponding to Cg and Cd, with ®ve new torsion angles. The van der Waals repulsion term proved suf®cient to keep the bonds to Cg close to tetrahedral. The haem and proline rings are closed by Ê ®xed upper limit distances of 0.1 A in order to allow suf®cient ¯exibility. In addition, for the oxidised state, two types of histidine axial ligands were de®ned with pseudo-atoms to de®ne the iron±nitrogen bond (Messias et al., 1998; Turner et al., 1998). One of the axial histidine ligand fragments carries a set of pseudo-atoms to represent the magnetic axes (Turner et al., 1998). Each histidine residue also carries four pseudo-atoms with a torsion angle to de®ne the angle of the histidine residue with respect to the haem plane. These extra pseudo-atoms are superimposed on the haem pyrrole group nitrogen atoms with Ê upper limits of 0.2 A. In the ®nal stages of structure re®nement, the calculated structures were checked for short distances (less Ê than 3.0 and 2.5 A for reduced and oxidised, respectively) between assigned protons that should give rise to signi®cant NOEs. The volume at the predicted frequencies was measured, whether or not there was a visible peak, and used in further calculations. This procedure provided upvs that ensure that protons will not be allowed to approach each other in the structures if there is no NOE in the spectrum. For this purpose, NOEs involving non-exchangeable protons were measured only from the 2H2O spectrum and those involving exchangeable protons were taken from the H2O spectrum. For the oxidised state this procedure was only carried out for the 80 ms spectra.

where gI is the nuclear magnetogyric ratio, ri is the distance from the proton nucleus to the metal, tS is the correlation time for electron spin relaxation, mB is the Bohr magneton, S is the electron spin angular momentum and oI and oS are the Larmor frequencies of the proton and the electron. The NOE intensity can be obtained from relaxation matrix calculations (Boelens et al., 1988, 1989) by adding the electron-nucleus dipolar contribution (equation (2)) to the diagonal elements of the internuclear dipole-dipole relaxation matrix. The electronic relaxation and all the constants of equation (2) are combined in a parameter, k, such that ri  krÀ6, which assumes that the unpaired i electrons are localised on the iron atoms. For simplicity, ts is assumed to be equal for the four haem groups. The values of k and tc were estimated from the ratio of intensities of cross-peaks in the 25 ms and 80 ms spectra, Ê yielding k  1 Â 106 A6 sÀ1 and tc  6 ns. Cross peak intensities were then calculated with and without paramagnetic effects using averaged distances from a family of preliminary structures. A correction factor was obtained for each cross-peak from the ratio of the two calculated values, Ipara/Idia, and each upper and lower ij ij volume limit was divided by its correction factor. Since this approach is approximate, all distance restraints were softened by a percentage to allow a margin for error. For this purpose, the cross-peak intensities calculated with the inclusion of paramagnetic relaxation were replaced by scaled measured values and backtransformed to give theoretical distances. Those distances that were outside the range obtained from the maximum and minimum experimental volumes were used to calculate a ratio that was used to relax all distance restraints. Dipolar shifts as restraints for the oxidised state Approximate dipolar shifts were obtained for input to the program PARADYANA (Turner et al., 1998) by subtracting the shifts of the reduced protein from those observed in the oxidised protein. Shifts whose diamagnetic reference are uncertain as a result of possible structural change between the two forms are not used. In computing target functions and gradients, a deviation of 1 ppm in a dipolar shift is treated as equal to a deviation Ê of 1 A in a distance restraint. Angle restraints for the oxidised state It has been shown that the 13C Fermi contact shifts of the haem substituents can be used to give information about the orientation of the axial histidine ligands (Louro et al., 1998b, Turner et al., 2000). The following equation was derived from a study of four tetrahaem cytochromes c3 (Louro et al., 1998b): ÁE  5  cos 4y cos b 3

Correction of volume restraints for the oxidised state Dipolar coupling to the unpaired electrons on the iron atoms of the haem groups increases the relaxation rates of nearby protons, reducing the NOE intensities. Correction for paramagnetic leakage has been shown to increase the resolution of calculated structures in regions close to the paramagnetic centre (Bertini et al., 1996a,b). Since lower distance limits are used here, it is particularly important to avoid them being overestimated and becoming too restrictive. The contribution to longitudinal relaxation from the dipolar interaction between a nuclear spin and each unpaired electron is described by the following equation (Bertini & Luchinat, 1986):

where ÁE, the molecular orbital splitting in kJ/mol, and y, the orientation of the rhombic perturbation can be

78
obtained by ®tting 13C contact shifts. The orientation of the bisector of the normals to the histidine planes is approximately equal to y, and the two histidine orientations can be obtained using the dihedral angle, b, between them. The information obtained from the NMR analysis does not differentiate between the two ligands, so preliminary structures were used to distinguish the ligands in a manner similar to stereospeci®c assignment. These angle restraints are important for de®ning the histidine ring orientations since the resonances for the ring protons are so broad that they are not observed in the NMR spectra. Structure calculations Reduced state Structure calculations were performed using the extended version of the program DYANA, called È INDYANA (Guntert et al., 1997; Turner et al., 1999). This program converts the NOE volumes used as input p into proton distances using a relation of the form r  k/n V, where r is the inter-proton distance, k the scaling factor and V the NOE volume. Separate scaling factors were used for NOEs involving two methyl groups, one methyl group and a single proton, two single protons in sidechains, or two backbone protons (HN and Ha). A power of n  4 was used in the structure calculations. The parameterisation for simulated annealing was described previously (Messias et al., 1998). The contribution of the restraints to target function was de®ned as DYANA type È 1 (Guntert et al., 1997) except for the ®xed upls used in the non-standard residues, which were de®ned as type 2. The program optimises the torsion angles that de®ne the structure and the scaling factors, k, simultaneously. Hence, each calculated structure is calibrated independently and has its own set of scaling factors. No signi®cant difference was found between the scaling factors obtained for protons in the side-chains and those of the backbone. A complete relaxation matrix analysis was used to estimate the error that might be induced by spin diffusion. NOE volumes were calculated from an ensemble of ten structures, using the average inverse sixth power of the inter-proton distances and a single correlation time optimised to ®t the set of measured NOEs, with methyl group rotation and rapid ring-¯ips taken into account. Theoretical NOEs were replaced by scaled measured NOEs and the combined NOE matrix was back-transformed to obtain inter-proton distances that take account of spin diffusion. The rmsd of the ratio between the calculated distances that deviated from the maximum or minimum distances obtained by automatic calibration in INDYANA was used to loosen all of the distance restraints in subsequent structure calculations. Since the pH of the sample (pH 7.3) is above the pKa of carboxylic groups in model peptides (Bashford & Karplus, 1990) and haem propionate groups (Moore & Pettigrew, 1990), they were treated as deprotonated forms. The amino groups were treated as protonated forms. Oxidised state The ®nal structures were calculated with the program PARADYANA (Turner et al. 1998), which optimises magnetic susceptibility tensors together with the parameters of the structure and the NOE calibration, using corrected NOE volumes, dipolar shifts and angle

Functional Cooperativities in a Tetrahaem Cytochrome restraints. The corrected NOE volumes were handled as described above. After conjugate gradient minimisation to remove strong overlaps, the structures were annealed with 60,000 steps and a weight of 0.1 for the valid dipolar shifts. The weighting of the dipolar shifts was then increased to 0.5 and a further 60,000 steps of annealing was carried out. The weighting of the van der Waals repulsion was then increased to 2.0, followed by conjugate gradient minimisation and 200 steps of molecular dynamics at constant temperature, and a ®nal 2000 steps of conjugate gradient minimisation. Structure analysis The program MOLMOL (Version 2.6) (Koradi et al., 1996) was used for superimposition, visual inspection, drawing of the various families and calculation of solvent exposures. Average solvent exposures were deterÊ mined using a radius of 1.4 A for the H2O molecule. The NMR structures were analysed with respect to the experimental restraints with the program AQUA (Laskowski et al., 1996). The stereochemical analysis of the structures was performed with the program WHAT IF (Vriend, 1990) and with both PROCHECK (Version 3.4.4) (Morris et al., 1992; Laskowski et al., 1993) and PROCHECKNMR programs (Version 3.4.4) (Laskowski et al., 1996). The program WHAT IF (Version 19990619-1458) (Vriend, 1990) was also used for the identi®cation of possible hydrogen bonds in the families of conformers and in Xray structure of the ferricytochrome (Matias et al., 1996) and for the identi®cation of crystal contacts in this structure. Identi®cation and classi®cation of the consensus secondary structure elements in the NMR structures ensemble, de®ned as those present in at least 50 % of the structures, was accomplished with the program PROMOTIF (Version 2.0) (Hutchinson & Thornton, 1996). Ring current shift calculations Proton ring current shifts were calculated for the ensemble of the best NMR structures for both the oxidised and reduced states and for the X-ray structure of the ferricytochrome, as described by Messias et al. (1998). The difference between the observed chemical shifts and È tabulated average values (Guntert et al., 1997) was used to approximate the experimental ring current shifts. Exchangeable protons were excluded because of the possibility of signi®cant shifts caused by hydrogen bonding. Protons from the haem ligands, His ring protons, and all Cys protons, were also excluded because the calculation may be inaccurate close to the haem group. For each unique or stereospeci®cally assigned proton i, the deviation between the calculated and the experimental ring current shift was treated as a squared scaled error (Messias et al., 1998): scaled errori2  dcalc À dobs 2 grad2  Á2 4

where dcalc is the calculated ring current shift, dobs is the ring current shift determined experimentally, grad is the Ê change in the local ring current shift over 1 A (obtained Ê from the gradient in ppm/A), and Á is a term which allows for uncertainty in the appropriate reference shifts for each proton, set at 0.2 ppm. For a pair of non-stereospeci®cally assigned protons i and j a squared average scaled error for the ring current
