et al. note that the core of the NTD of M3 has some, but very limited, structural similarity to vCKBP-2. The b-strands that compose the core structure of M3 and vCKBP-2 are common, but the connecting loops and helices appear completely distinct. This suggests common structural features among vCKBPs. In this case, the structure of vCKBP-2 complexed to a chemokine has not been determined, and thus we do not have information on how this interaction takes place. However, we do know from binding studies of CCL2 mutant analogs to vCKBP-2 encoded by vaccinia virus that the residues of CCL2 involved in vCKBP-2 binding are those implicated in chemokine receptor binding, a situation that parallels the interaction of CCL2 with M3 [14,15]. The amino acid sequence is unrelated among these viral proteins despite their ability to interact with the same or related ligands. Some of these vCKBPs appear to use the same general strategy of receptor mimicry and might share common structural features or interact with the same domain of chemokines, as we have seen so far in the initial studies on the herpesvirus M3 protein and the poxvirus vCKBP-2. Viruses have evolved a variety of proteins unrelated to the chemokine receptor that have the ability to bind chemokines and modulate their activity. Further investigations will provide more insights into the molecular basis of distinct vCKBP­ chemokine interactions and their inhibitory mechanism. Ultimately, this will provide valuable information to rationally develop new strategies of immune modulation based on the neutralization of chemokines in solution and the inhibition of their proinflammatory properties [16].

Is the bacterial ferrous iron transporter FeoB a living fossil?

The cytoplasmic membrane protein FeoB of Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Legionella pneumophila and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is necessary for Fe21 uptake. The C-terminal part of FeoB is predicted to contain 8­12 membrane-spanning helices. The N-terminal domain shows much similarity to eukaryotic and prokaryotic G proteins and, indeed, GTPase activity is necessary for Fe21 transport. Four of the five

characteristic conserved G protein motifs have been identified in FeoB proteins. Whether FeoB is involved directly, via its Me21 binding site, or indirectly in Fe21 transport, remains to be investigated. Most bacteria living in an oxic environment produce iron chelators, called siderophores, to satisfy their needs for iron, which forms highly insoluble ferric hydroxide at neutral pH. Ferric siderophores have attracted much interest not only because of their appealing brown, red,

Fig. 1. Bacterial iron transport. A schematic view of iron uptake systems of Gramnegative bacteria is shown. Under low-iron stress, many bacteria secrete siderophores to bind Fe3þ and take it up by specific receptors (R) that are energized by the Ton complex (T). Some pathogenic bacteria are able to use lactoferrin- or transferrin-bound iron either with the help of their siderophores or with specialized receptors in their outer membranes (OM) [2,5]. Often, these bacteria have additional systems to utilize the heme-bound iron of their host either by secreting a special heme-binding protein, a hemophore [14], or through specific receptors for heme, hemoglobin, or hemopexin, which are able to extract the heme and transport it across the outer membrane [14]. All these different substrates ­ ferric iron from transferrin, heme, and Fe3þ-siderophores ­ are transported by specialized ABC transporters (ABC) across the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) [1,2,15]. In the cytoplasm (C), Fe3þ-siderophore reductases or heme oxygenases help to mobilize the iron for cell metabolism. FeoB is a transporter, which can either utilize the more-soluble Fe2þ or possibly obtain Fe2þ from mostly uncharacterized reductive processes (labeled Red in the figure) at the cell surface or in the periplasm (P). FeoA and FeoC might take part in Fe2þ transport. Mobilization and Fe2þ transport is not as well-characterized as Fe3þ transport is.

with 27% identity to E. coli FeoB has been found. Helicobacter pylori is able to live in the extremely hostile acidic environment of the stomach, where it can cause gastric ulcer or even stomach cancer. A study of its ironuptake systems has revealed that FeoB is the most important iron transporter [8]. A tonB mutant, which is expected to be unable to use any ferric siderophores, has no reduced ferric-citrate uptake, which indicates that ferric citrate efficiently passes through the outer membrane of H. pylori without the help of TonB. The feoB mutant has a reduced Fe2þ and Fe3þ-citrate uptake, indicating that a reductase might supply FeoB with Fe2þ. When whole cells are treated for 10 mins with the protonophore FCCP, the ATPase inhibitor DCCD, or the ABC transporter inhibitor vanadate, iron uptake is inhibited. Therefore, an active process is responsible for Fe2þ uptake [8]. However, without further study, it is not possible to conclude which energy source is required for FeoBdependent iron uptake. A feoB mutant of the intracellular parasite Legionella pneumophila has a lowered Fe2þ uptake and is attenuated for intracellular growth [9]. A member of the FeoB protein family transports Fe2þ also in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. In mutants lacking Fe3þ-siderophore uptake systems, Fe2þ uptake is enhanced, and an iron-deprived feoB mutant has lower Fe2þ uptake than the parent strain does [10]. These few reports show that FeoB contributes to the iron supply of bacteria, and its importance for growth varies, depending on the species studied. FeoB is a GTPase The E. coli feoB gene codes for a membrane protein of 773 amino acids with an N-terminal nucleotide-binding site that was at first erroneously interpreted as an ATPbinding site [4]. A recent BLAST search clearly shows the high similarity of FeoB to GTP-binding proteins, especially to eukaryotic G proteins in the first 160 amino acids, with 8 ­ 12 membrane-spanning a-helices predicted for the C-terminal domain (residues 280­ 773). Recently, Unger's group [11], who observed the striking similarities of FeoB to eukaryotic G proteins (Box 1), managed to characterize the E. coli FeoB protein as a GTPase. The N-terminal domain of FeoB, predicted to be in the cytoplasm, was cloned and shown to bind the fluorescent non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue 20 /30 -O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine-50 -[(b,g)imido]triphosphate (mant-GMPPNP) and not the corresponding analogue of ATP, mant-AMPPNP. The N-terminal domain of FeoB and the full-length FeoB protein slowly hydrolyzed GTP; no hydrolysis of ATP was observed. This clearly showed that FeoB is, in fact, a GTP-hydrolyzing enzyme. The FeoB N-terminus is similar to that in G proteins GTPases contain five well-defined sequence motifs, G1­ G5, which have been shown in different G protein structures to bind Mg2þ and certain parts of GTP/GDP. In silico analysis of E. coli FeoB revealed the G1 (residues 10 ­ 17 in FeoB), G2 (residue 37), and G3 (residues 56 ­ 59) sequence motifs in the N-terminus [11] (Fig. 2). The G1 site in different G proteins binds the a- and b-phosphates of the nucleotides, whereas both the G2 and the G3 sites bind the

blue or green fluorescent colors, but also because of their interesting uptake mechanisms and their role in pathogenicity, as evidenced by numerous publications (Fig. 1) [1,2]. Ferrous iron uptake by bacteria is certainly as important as ferric iron uptake, yet it is less wellstudied. Fifteen years ago, an Escherichia coli strain with a mutation in the feo genes responsible for a ferrous iron uptake system was isolated [3]. Because cloning of the feo genes was difficult, it took another 6 years until the sequence of feoA and feoB was published [4]. The feoA<Tn5 and feoB<Tn5 mutants were impaired in the uptake of ferrous iron, as was shown by transport experiments with radiolabeled 55Fe2þ. In ,50% of the bacterial genomes sequenced to date, a feoB-like gene was found. Phenotypes of Feo mutants In colonies of E. coli Feo mutants, the iron-regulated genes for siderophore uptake are de-repressed, which indicates that the cells are in need of iron. In the Feoþ parental strain, 40 mM iron in the agar completely represses these iron-reporter genes. This regulation is accomplished by the general regulator of iron metabolism, the Fur protein, which acts as a repressor with iron as corepressor [5]. feo mutants of E. coli [6] and Salmonella enterica [7] are defective in colonization of the mouse intestine, but the feoB mutation does not attenuate S. enterica serovar Typhimurium for oral or intraperitoneal infection of mice.

Box 1. Characteristics of G proteins
G proteins use GTP hydrolysis as an energy source mainly for their regulatory activity [12]. Three types of G proteins have been characterized: (i) the monomeric small G proteins that act as switches or adaptors in eukaryotes (the well-known Ras protein is a member of this group and initiates, in response to a receptor signal, the MAP kinase cascade leading to the activation of transcription factors in the nucleus); (ii) elongation factors, e.g. EF-Tu; and (iii) heterotrimeric G proteins, which are widely distributed in eukaryotes, that signal the recognition of external stimuli by a membrane receptor to enzymes on the cytoplasmic site of the membrane. Sequence similarities of all three types of G proteins point to a common evolutionary origin of their GTPase domains. GTP binding and hydrolysis trigger conformational changes within the switch region of the catalytic domain and change the binding affinity of the divalent Mg2þ ion. The GTP- and GDP-bound states define the active and the inactive states of the regulatory G proteins, respectively. Five conserved loops, G1 ­G5, constitute the guanine nucleotide binding domain [12] (Fig. 2).

g-phosphate and Mg2þ [12]. The G1 and G3 motifs correspond to the Walker A and Walker B boxes, respectively, found in many nucleotide-binding proteins; this had led to the erroneous classification of FeoB as an ATPase [4]. Two potential G4 motifs have been detected in FeoB. In G proteins, the G4 site specifically forms hydrogen bonds to the guanine ring. One G4 site in FeoB (residues 120­ 123) (Fig. 2), identified by mutation, is indispensable for mant-GMPPNP binding [11]. A D123N mutation introduced in this site allows binding of the xanthosine analogue mant-XMPPNP; binding does not occur with the non-mutated N-terminal domain of FeoB (N-FeoB). This type of mutation has been introduced into different G proteins (Ras and EF-Tu), and the same change in substrate specificity is observed. The G5 motif, which buttresses the guanine recognition site [12], has not been detected in the various FeoB proteins. Low GTPase activity and slow release of GDP are characteristic of many isolated G proteins. The slow release of GDP keeps the proteins' regulatory activity mostly in the off state (see Box 1). Also, the E. coli FeoB protein has a low GTPase activity, but in contrast to all known GTPases with a low GTPase activity, the release of GDP is very fast. The binding affinity for GTP is in the micromolar range, whereas Ras-like G proteins have an affinity in the picomolar to nanomolar range. These kinetic parameters distinguish the GTPase activity of FeoB from that of other G proteins. Function of the GTPase domain Whether or not the function of the GTPase domain is necessary for Fe2þ uptake has been tested in a complementation experiment using the mutated FeoB-D123N protein. In a plate assay, only FeoB, but not FeoB-D123N,

leads to repression of the iron-regulated reporter gene, indicating that no functional Fe2þ transport is obtained with the mutant protein [11]. The G-protein-like domain is necessary for Fe2þ uptake, but its function in this process remains to be elucidated. Several possibilities exist but, in every case, additional regulatory factors would be required: (1) The G domain is only responsible for the activity regulation of the transporter domain in the membrane, and Fe2þ uptake is mainly driven by the membrane potential. As discussed by Marlovits et al. [11], slow GTP hydrolysis and fast GDP release would cause a mostly open Fe2þ channel, for which additional factors might be necessary to adjust uptake to the demands of the cell. (2) The FeoB protein is not the transporter, but regulates an unknown transporter, as discussed by Marlovits et al. [11]. This seems less likely because such mutants have not been detected in different genetic screens. (3) The G domain energizes by GTP hydrolysis the uptake of Fe2þ, and the low GTPase activity is modulated by accessory proteins, such as FeoA or FeoC. This hypothesis seems most attractive because it is known that the affinity of the divalent cation Mg2þ for G proteins is drastically lowered after hydrolysis of GTP. This change in affinity might be a mechanism of Me2þ transport. For (1) or (3), additional factors might be FeoA and FeoC; however, in several bacteria (e.g. H. pylori), no FeoA or FeoC homologs were detected. Is the GTPase domain directly involved in Fe21 uptake? The ionic radius of Fe2þ (0.76 £ 10210m) differs from that of Mg2þ (0.65 £ 10210m); however, small changes in the protein structure could accommodate these differences and could allow binding of Fe2þ to the Mg2þ-binding site. For this transport model, the cation-binding site should be accessible through the membrane channel from the outside, allowing Fe2þ to bind in the GTP-bound state (with the opportunity to replace Mg2þ). Hydrolysis of GTP would initiate a structural change, closing the membrane channel and allowing release of Fe2þ into the cytoplasm. In G proteins, the affinity for Mg2þ is lower in the GDPbound state than in the GTP-bound state. Accessory proteins could regulate the GTPase activity and control iron uptake. Experiments testing the binding of Fe2þ (or Mn2þ) to the G domain would clarify this. In addition, it would be interesting to see how these ions, in comparison

Fig. 2. Conserved sequence motifs of G proteins. G proteins contain five sequence motifs, G1­ G5, that contain the conserved residues indicated and that are important for the binding of GTP/GDP and Mg2þ [12]. The corresponding motifs of E. coli FeoB are shown [11]. The G4 motif in FeoB (and in most bacteria) deviates from the consensus in that it has an M instead of a K. However, a few bacterial sequences with a K in that position are found. The question marks in G5 indicate that the G5 motif was not identified in FeoB [11]. A candidate might be the GCP motif which, however, is not well conserved in all FeoB sequences.

to Mg2þ, influence GTP/GDP binding kinetics and GTPase activity. Is FeoB a `living fossil' in the world of G proteins? ¨ ¨ According to Wachtershauser [13], iron and sulfur were important for the early steps of life. In the world before the appearance of free oxygen, more than three billion years ago, ferrous iron transport should have been the main source of iron for cells. It is interesting to note that not only in the genomes of bacteria, but also in the genomes of several archaea, sequences encoding proteins homologous to FeoB are found. Whether or not these proteins function as Fe2þ transporters remains to be shown. Conclusions The bacterial FeoB protein is a G protein with properties of GTPase activity kinetics and GTP/GDP binding that differ from those of the eukaryotic proteins. The GTPase activity of FeoB is necessary for Fe2þ transport. Whether the uptake is directly accomplished by the FeoB protein or more indirectly remains to be shown.

Pyoverdines (PVDs) are complex siderophores produced by members of the fluorescent Pseudomonas. They comprise a dihydroxyquinoline fluorescent chromophore joined to a peptide of remarkably variable length and composition. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, PVDs also function as signal molecules for the production of virulence factors. Genes responsible for the biosynthesis, excretion, uptake and regulation of these high-affinity siderophores are located either at a single locus or at up to three different loci in the genomes of the four pseudomonads analyzed.

backbone of PVD is assembled by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and modified by accessory enzymes in the cytoplasm, and probably the periplasm. Regulation of PVD production and uptake depends on two extracytoplasmic sigma factors (ECF-ss), PvdS and FpvI, together with one anti-sigma, FpvR. Siderophores are iron(III) chelators produced by aerobic bacteria in response to iron limitation and their structure can be extremely diverse [1,2]. Pyoverdines (PVDs) are yellow-green, fluorescent, high-affinity siderophores excreted by all fluorescent Pseudomonas species and by
