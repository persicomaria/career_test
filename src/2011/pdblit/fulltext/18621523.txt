Starting from the known FXR agonist GW 4064 1a, a series of alternately 3,5-substituted isoxazoles was prepared. Several of these analogs were potent full FXR agonists. A subset of this series, with a tether between the isoxazole ring and the 3-position aryl substituent, were equipotent FXR agonists to GW 4064 1a, with the 2,6-dimethyl phenol analog 1t having greater FRET FXR potency than GW 4064 1a.

The farnesoid X receptor is a nuclear receptor expressed in liver, gall bladder, intestine, kidney, and adrenal glands.1,2 Its function is critical for the regulation of bile acids as well as for lipid metabolism.3,4 Furthermore, FXR also plays an important role in glucose homeostasis.5 Because of the involvement of FXR in these physiologies, FXR modulators could have great potential in the treatment of cholestasis,6­8 liver fibrosis,9­11 and diabetes.5 GlaxoSmithKline scientists have previously disclosed the discovery of GW4064 1a,12 a potent FXR agonist. GW4064 1a has proven a useful tool compound to explore FXR biology, however; the stilbene moiety, contained in GW 4064 1a, is unstable to UV light exposure, as well as being a potentially toxic pharmacophore, lessening its potential for further development.13 Nonetheless, the X-ray co-crystal structure of GW 4064 1a with FXR revealed that the 2,6-dichlorophenyl isoxazole fragment of

GW 4064 1a made key binding interactions with helices 10 and 12 of FXR,13 implying that modifications in this portion of the agonist could affect co-activator/co-repressor recruitment to this nuclear receptor. Thus, employing GW4064 1a as a lead, GSK scientists made a series of analogs substituted at the 3- and/or 5-positions of the isoxazole ring, with the hopes that these compounds could exhibit altered modulation of FXR function. Furthermore, they might have increased potency and/or be more metabolically stable. Any interesting discoveries from these analogs might then be applied in combination with other improvements to the lead molecule to arrive at a clinical candidate.

Various analogs with different functionalities at the 3- and 5-positions of the isoxazole were initially prepared employing the

synthetic route disclosed in the original Glaxo Wellcome article,12 starting from different commercially available or known aldehydes 2a­e (X@O) or alcohols 2f­h (X@H, OH)14 as depicted in Scheme 1. This multi-step procedure, involving aldehyde oxime formation, chlorination, base promoted b-keto-ester 4a mediated isoxazole formation, and aluminum hydride mediated ester reduction, was used to produce the alcohols 6a, and 6c­h. A single modification to this sequence was utilized to prepare alcohol 6b. An attempt to reduce the ester 5b with di-iso-butylaluminum hydride failed to give clean conversion to the desired alcohol 6b. Therefore, an alternative approach involving hydrolysis of the ester, followed by conversion of the resulting acid to its mixed anhydride with isopropyl chloroformate, and subsequent reduction with sodium borohydride afforded the alcohol 6b. By employing different b-ketoesters 4b­e, synthesized according to literature procedures,15,16 various alcohols 6i­l with different alkyl groups at the 5-position of the isoxazole were also prepared. The alcohols 6a­l were then coupled with phenol 717 via a Mitsunobu reaction protocol to give the esters 8a­g and 8ai­an.18 The penultimate esters were then hydrolyzed to produce the desired acids 1a­g and 1ai­an.19 Alternatively, extended heteroatom linked 3-position isoxazoles were prepared by a modified procedure, allowing more rapid synthesis of analogs as outlined below. The tert-butyl ether 8g was converted to the alcohol 8h via acid-catalyzed cleavage of the tertbutyl fragment. Then, this key intermediate 8h was utilized in multiple Mitsunobu reactions with various substituted phenols 9a­b, 9f­w, trifluoroacetamides 9c and 9d, thiophenol 9e, and thiotetrazole 9x, to produce the esters 8i­m and 8p­ah. The low acidity of most anilines precludes there successful utilization in standard Mitsunobu reactions, therefore, the commercially available anilines 9c­d (X@NH) were converted to their corresponding trifluo-

The esters 8i­m and 8p­ah were then hydrolyzed to yield the acids 1i­m and 1p­ah, with concomitant hydrolysis of the trifluoroacetamide activating groups for 8k and 8l. The thiophenol 8m was oxidized with approximately 2 equiv of 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to yield a mixture of the sulfoxide 8n and the sulfone 8o, which were separated by flash column chromatography. The esters 8n and 8o were then hydrolyzed to yield the acids 1n and 1o. The structure­activity relationships of the isoxazole analogs 1a­an are depicted in Table 1. A X-ray co-crystal structure of GW 4064 1a revealed little room for further substitution of the terminal aryl ring.13 Moreover, since ortho, ortho disubstitution of the terminal phenyl ring is important to conformationally twist the aryl ring out of plane of the isoxazole ring, a dichloropyridine analog 1b was prepared with the hope of increasing water solubility and possibly forming a hydrogen bond interaction with the receptor. This substitution had little effect on potency or efficacy in either the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for recruitment of an SRC-1 peptide (EC50 = 150 nM, %Max = 97) or the transient transfection (TT) assay (EC50 = 52 nM, %Max = 88), despite the higher desolvation penalty to strip hydrogen bonded water molecules from the pyridine of analog 1b relative to phenyl moiety of lead 1a (TT EC50 = 65 nM), implying that the pyridine nitrogen might be forming a weak interaction with the nuclear receptor. The X-ray co-crystal structure of GW 4064 1a, with the FXR ligand binding domain, further revealed some open space adjacent to the terminal aryl ring, that might be exploited to enhance the potency or efficacy of the lead 1a, by employing a tether to allow more flexibility in the ligand's ability to interact with the receptor. Thus, several extended phenyl analogs were prepared to explore this hypothesis. The naked benzyl compound 1c (TT EC50 = 230 nM) was less potent than the lead 1a. This potency drop is likely the sum of two factors. A one carbon tether possibly places the terminal phenyl at the wrong angle to properly fit in the receptor subpocket. A second reason for the decreased potency could be the lack of optimal substitution on the phenyl ring. The more flexible and longer phenethyl derivative 1d (TT EC50 = 93 nM) was more potent than the one atom tether 1c, despite a higher entropic penalty to bind in a single conformation than its less flexible analog 1c. This flexibility likely allows the two atom tether of 1d to kink around, placing its phenyl group in an acceptable position in the protein. In contrast, the phenpropyl derivative 1e (TT, EC50 = 1200 nM) is 10-fold less potent than its shorter analog 1d. It is also a partial agonist. This decrease in activity could reflect the higher entropic penalty to freeze out the appropriate binding conformer of the longer tether 1e. Yet, more likely, the phenpropyl derivative 1e is too large to fit into the receptor subpocket and distorts the active receptor conformation, altering its ability to recruit co-activators and resulting in lower efficacy (FRET%Max = 44, TT%Max = 68). Appropriate substitution of the two atom tether phenyl ring could enhance interactions with the receptor, leading to improved efficacy and/or potency. The 2,6-dichlorophenyl analog 1f (TT, EC50 = 48 nM) was twice as potent as the naked phenyl compound 1d and equipotent to the starting lead GW 4064 1a. A heteroatom was introduced into the tether between the isoxazole and the terminal phenyl ring to facilitate synthesis of substituted terminal aryl analogs. The naked phenyl ether 1i (TT, EC50 = 1200 nM) was substantially less potent than the all carbon linker 1d, possibly because of a higher enthalpic penalty to strip away water molecules upon receptor binding. Analog 1i serves as a baseline for the effect of phenyl ring substitution. Interestingly, the tert-butyl ether synthetic intermediate 1g (TT, EC50 = 600 nM) is slightly more potent than the phenyl ether 1i. In contrast, the alcohol 1h (TT,

EC50 = >10,000 nM) is a poor agonist, implying that this receptor subpocket appears to prefer hydrophobic ligands. In contrast to the drop in activity of the phenyl ether 1i relative to the naked phenyl 1d, the dichloroaryl ether analog 1j (TT, EC50 = 89 nM) exhibited similar potency to the 2,6-dichlorophenyl derivative 1f and GW 4064 1a. Possibly, analog 1j pays a lower desolvation penalty upon receptor binding, as the ortho, ortho disubstitution in 1j could shield the ether oxygen from hydrogen bonding to bulk water. Furthermore, substitution of the ether oxygen of compound 1j with nitrogen or sulfur is well tolerated as the aniline 1k (TT,

EC50 = 140 nM) and the thioether 1m (TT, EC50 = 100 nM) have similar activity to the ether 1j. At physiological pH, the pyridine 1l (TT, EC50 = 420 nM) likely bears at least a partial positive charge and the tetrazole 1ah (TT, EC50 = 2100 nM) is quite hydrophilic. Reinforcing the hypothesis that this receptor subpocket prefers hydrophobic ligands, these charged analogs are weak, partial agonists of FXR. In contrast, the tether region tolerates some hydrophilicity, as the racemic sulfoxide 1n (TT, EC50 = 72 nM) and the sulfone 1o (TT, EC50 = 390 nM) are potent, full agonists of FXR.

In an effort to discover the optimal substitution for the two atom tethered aryl ring, a systematic exploration of the receptor subpocket was undertaken. The ortho-chlorophenyl analog 1p (TT, EC50 = 82 nM) was a potent full FXR agonist. In contrast, the meta-chloro- and para-chlorophenyl analogs 1q (TT, EC50 = 2000 nM) and 1r (TT, EC50 = 1300 nM) were less potent and only partial agonists. Furthermore, the 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 3,4-, and 3,5dichlorophenyl analogs 1w­aa are also less potent agonists than the 2,6-derivative 1j, implying that the protein cannot accommodate large meta or para substituents in this region. The 2-naphthyland 1-naphthyl derivatives 1af (TT, EC50 = 2300 nM) and 1ag (TT, EC50 = 1200 nM) give further support to this conclusion. In addition to exploring the optimal substitution pattern of the terminal aryl ring, the nature of the substituents was also altered to ascertain the best complementarity between the receptor and ligand. Thus, the 2-chloro-6-methylphenyl-, the 2,6-dimethyl phenyl-, the 2-chloro-6-fluorophenyl-, and the difluorophenyl analogs 1s­v, respectively, were prepared. The methyl substituted analogs 1s (EC50 = 150 nM) and 1t (EC50 = 56 nM) maintain potency, while there is a diminishment in potency as chlorines are sequentially replaced by fluorines as in analogs 1u (EC50 = 290 nM) and 1v (EC50 = 720 nM). From these results, it can be inferred that the electronic nature of the 2- and 6-substituents are less important than their steric size for receptor potency, as the more electronegativity, but smaller fluorine group is less potent than the larger, but more electropositive methyl fragment, in addition to being less active than the large, electronegative chlorine moiety. The 2,4,6-trisubstituted analogs 1ab­ae were also prepared with the goal of shielding a potential oxidatively soft site from metabolism. Unfortunately, trisubstitution did not enhance potency. Since the two atom tether likely exists in only one of its three lowest energy conformers when bound to the receptor, biasing the ligand by rotamer constraint should lower the entropic cost of binding, increasing analog potency. A trans-cyclopropyl tether analog 1ai was synthesized as an anti-rotamer mimic to try to take advantage of this possibility, but this analog was a poor agonist. Thus, the preferred rotamer of 1f is either not the anti-rotamer or the constraining scaffolding is not accommodated by the receptor. The X-ray co-crystal structure of GW 4064 1a with the FXR ligand binding domain revealed a small hydrophobic space near the iso-propyl moiety of the isoxazole. Thus, several small 5-alkylisoxazole analogs were prepared with the hope of enhancing the interaction of the ligand with the receptor. Furthermore, these analogs might be sterically less susceptible to oxidative metabolism, in contrast to the methine CH of the iso-propyl group. Both the cyclobutyl 1aj (TT, EC50 = 140 nM) and cyclopentyl 1ak (TT, EC50 = 240 nM) were slightly less potent than the lead 1a. Of the two sec-butyl derivatives 1am (TT, EC50 = 290 nM) and 1an (TT, EC50 = 93 nM), the R-isomer was slightly more potent than the S-isomer and equipotent to GW 4064 1a.20 It was hoped that the 3-pentyl analog 1al, being slightly bigger that the sec-butyl analog 1an, would have the advantage of completely filling the receptor subpocket, yet be achiral. Unfortunately, 1al (TT, EC50 = 280 nM) although a full agonist, was less potent than GW 4064 1a. Thus, although attempts were made to maximize the interaction of the 5-isoxazole substituent with the FXR ligand binding domain, there was no enhancement in activity realized by these analogs. A X-ray co-crystal structure of sulfoxide 1n with the ligand binding domain of FXR and a SRC-1 co-activator peptide was solved. It is depicted in Figure 1, overlayed with the X-ray co-crystal structure of GW 4064 1a,13 and these structures provide insight into the structure­activity relationships of these analogs. The vast majority of the binding sites are very similar between GW 4064 1a and sulfoxide 1n. The carboxylic acids of the compounds both

interact with the guanidine of 331Arg, while the stilbenoid moieties also have similar interactions with 335Ile, 348Leu, 287Leu, 328Met, and 290Met. Only a few side chain residues of amino acids exhibit significantly different conformations (rotomers) between the two structures, while there are no major changes in the amino acid backbone conformations of the two complexes. The altered residues are 284Phe, 357Ile, and 454Trp, which rotate to accommodate the larger ligand. The conformation of the thiophenol oxide ring of 1n is significantly different from the phenyl ring of 1a, with the dichlorophenyl ring of analog 1n in a more `stacked' arrangement to the isoxazole compared to the orthogonal disposition of the aryl ring in lead 1a. However, despite this different arrangement, the dichlorophenyl group of sulfoxide 1n occupies similar space in the binding site of FXR as the aryl ring of lead 1a, interacting with 365Met, 369Tyr, 329Phe, 352Ile, 357Ile, and 454Trp. Most of these residues show little movement between the two co-crystal structures, but 357Ile and 454Trp do shift in the sulfoxide 1n structure relative to the GW 4064 1a structure. The positional change of 454 Trp cascades to 284Phe, which moves to maintain a face to edge aromatic interaction with the indole of 454Trp. In order to accommodate the larger linker, the plane of the isoxazole has shifted slightly, but the iso-propyl of analog 1n remains in a similar location. The shift of the isoxazole, places it in position to accept a hydrogen bond from the imidazole NH of 447His. This hydrogen bond of the isoxazole nitrogen of analog 1n appears stronger than the potential hydrogen bond of the isoxazole moiety in the GW 4064 1a complex, but this change also results in a weaker interaction between the isoxazole of compound 1n and the indole of 454 Trp. Both 447His and 469Trp (on the AF2 helix) remain in a face to edge stacking arrangement, believed to be important for coactivator recruitment, like in the GW 4064 1a structure. Most of the analogs shown in Table 1 were tested in a panel of nuclear receptor assays. In general, the compounds were at least 100-fold selective for FXR versus the other nuclear receptors. The series did have some activity in the PXR assay, where several compounds were weak full agonists. The activities of analog 1n are shown in Table 2 as an example. Several compounds of the series were selected for pharmacokinetic studies in rats. As shown in Table 3, all of the analogs profiled

The alcohol 2h was prepared from commercially available (E)-2,6dichlorocinnamic acid in three synthetic steps. First, the acid was esterified employing the Fischer method with catalytic sulfuric acid in methanol (94% yield). Then, the resulting unsaturated methyl ester was converted to the methyl 2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate via its addition to the in situ generated sulfur ylide prepared by adding sodium hydride to trimethylsulfoxonium iodide in dimethyl sulfoxide (26% yield). Finally, reduction of the ester with di-iso-butylaluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran afforded the desired [2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropyl]methanol 2h (78% yield). 15. Miller, W. H.; Dessert, A.

Mitsunobu reactions in this Letter were performed under the following conditions: a mixture of 1.0 equiv each of the alcohol, the phenol, di-isopropyl diazodicarboxylate, and triphenylphosphine were placed in a microwave reaction vessel and toluene was added to make a 0.1 M mixture. Then, the vessel was sealed and heated in a microwave reactor between 85 and 100 °C for between 600 and 1000 s. The resulting mixture was then concentrated and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography with gradients of ethyl acetate in hexanes. 19. Saponification reactions in this Letter were performed under the following conditions: The ester was placed in a microwave reaction vessel and a 2:1 mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol was added, followed by 1.5 equiv of 1 M sodium hydroxide. Then, the vessel was sealed and heated in a microwave reactor between 100 and 120 °C for 500 s. The resulting mixture was neutralized with 1 M hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. 20. The stereoisomers of the sec-butyl group were separated at the alcohol 6l stage and carried through the rest of the synthesis separately to give analogs 1am and 1an.

exhibited medium volumes of distribution (VSS = 1100­2100 mL/ kg), with the three two atom tether analogs (1j, 1k, and 1ab) having moderate clearances (Cl = 15­20 mL/min/kg) of less than one third of hepatic blood flow in the rat, translating into terminal half-lives (t1/2 = 130­140 min) of greater than 2 h. Unfortunately, all of the analogs had poor oral exposure (F = 1.9­9.2%). These clearances were significantly lower than the starting lead GW 4064 1a (Cl = 36 mL/min/kg). Furthermore, despite similar clearances between phenol 1j and aniline 1k, the potentially more soluble aniline 1k (F = 2.6%) had a lower oral bioavailability than the phenol 1j (F = 9.2%). Possibly, the stilbene moiety that is present in all of the analogs is detrimental to oral exposure and overrides any changes elsewhere in the agonists. In summary, a series of analogs of GW 4064 1a were synthesized as potential modulators of FXR. Incorporation of a two atom tether between the isoxazole and the 2,6-dichlorophenyl ring produced a number of highly efficacious FXR agonists with comparable efficacy and potency to the original lead 1a. Introduction of a heteroatom into the linker allowed the rapid production of terminal ring analogs. Several of the compounds with a two atom tether had lower in vivo clearances than GW 4064 1a. Structure­activity relationships identified from this work should prove useful in the design of improved FXR modulators based on GW 4064 1a.
