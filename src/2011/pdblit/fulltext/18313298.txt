The effectiveness of modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in the treatment of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis is demonstrated by the beneficial effects of anti-TNFa therapeutics such as Enbrel and Remicade.1­4 However, due to disadvantages including high costs and inconvenient dosing regimens, new generations of anti-inflammatory therapies call for the development of safe and effective orally active small molecules. Of particular interest is the development of selective inhibitors of the p38 MAP kinase pathway.5­7 The a isoform of p38 MAP kinase has been shown to be a control point which, when activated, leads to the downstream release of a pro-inflammatory cassette of cytokines including interleukin1b (IL-1b), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa). As p38a activation is not involved in normal physiology, increases in the levels of these cytokines are thought to play a pathophysiological role in inflammatory processes associated with rheumatoid arthritis,8­10 inflammatory bowel disease,11 congestive heart failure12 and psoriasis.13 Since p38a activation leads to cytokine expression, it is thought that inhibition of p38a with compounds such as SCIO-469 (Fig. 1) can normalize this aberrant physiology and play a key role in the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In fact, SCIO-469 was evaluated in human phase I and phase II clinical trials.14,15

SCIO-469 is a potent inhibitor of p38a (IC50 = 9 nM), with modest isoform selectivity over p38b (IC50 = 98 nM). Furthermore, it is over 1000-fold selective against a number of additional kinases and receptors. The compound inhibits LPS-induced cytokine release in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (EC50 = 20­50 nM for TNFa, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8) and blocks the LPS-induced release of TNFa in 10Â diluted human whole blood (EC50 = 300 nM). It has oral bioavailability in rat (F% 15), dog (F% 69), and monkey (F% 12) with a dose-dependent linear PK profile and is active in a rat collagen induced arthritis model at 40 mg/ kg, QD. Unfortunately, the half life (T1/2) of SCIO-469 is relatively short as revealed in various animal PK evaluations. In fact, from both in vitro and in vivo metabolism studies, a major debenzylated metabolite (1) was observed and was thought to be responsible for the shortened half life (Fig. 2). Due to these problems, considerable effort was placed on the development of next-generation backups with improved pharmacokinetic profiles compared to SCIO-469.

Docking studies of SCIO-469 into a p38a MAP kinase crystal structure revealed additional space at the benzylic position for further substitution (Fig. 3). In an effort to improve the metabolic stability of SCIO-469, introduction of steric bulk at and around the site of metabolism was pursued. Thus, the introduction of methyl, cyano, and phenyl groups at the SCIO-469 benzylic position, as well as the preparation of cyclic compounds (7­12 and 19) were proposed. The common intermediate 6, used in the preparation of compounds 7­12, was prepared from the D-tartaric acid salt of chiral 2,5-dimethyl-4-fluorobenzyl piperazine, compound 4.16 As shown in Scheme 1, Boc-protection of compound 4 followed by debenzylation afforded Boc-protected piperazine 5. Subsequent coupling with 6-chloro-indole carboxylic acid yielded compound 6. Compounds 7­

Figure 3. Proposed binding of SCIO-469 (yellow) and compound 9 (magenta) to p38a using a published p38a X-ray crystal structure (PDB code: 1ove). Carbonyl oxygen of SCIO-469 and 9 make bi-dentate hydrogen bonds to backbone nitrogen of Met-109 and Gly-100. 4-Fluoro benzyl group of SCIO-469 and one of the phenyl rings of the diphenylmethane analog of 9 occupy a hydrophobic pocket commonly known as the gatekeeper pocket. In addition, the substituted indole moieties occupy a second hydrophobic pocket near the solvent front. The second phenyl ring of the bis-phenyl moiety of 9 occupies an opening near the conserved residues Lys53 and Asp-168.

9 were completed by initial treatment of compound 6 with appropriate substituted benzyl bromides followed by reacting with oxalyl chloride and dimethylamine. Compound 10 was prepared similarly but employed a reductive amination instead of a direct displacement. Compounds 11 and 12 were prepared by initial reaction with 4-fluorobenzaldehyde and ethyl aluminum cyanide.17 As illustrated in Scheme 2, the synthesis of cyclized indazole analog 19 originated from commercially available ortho-chloro

benzoyl chloride. Reaction with tosyl hydrazide followed by treatment with thionyl chloride yielded the chloroimine 14. Displacement of 14 with (2R,5S)-dimethyl-piperazine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester18 provided intermediate 15, which upon treatment with K2CO3, cyclized into indazole 16. Following the removal of the Boc protecting group, the amine was coupled with 6-chloro-1methyl-1H-indole-5-carboxylic acid16 to afford compound 18. Subsequent treatment of 18 with oxalyl chloride and dimethyl amine followed by cleavage of the tosyl protecting group gave the desired indazole analog 19.

As indicated in Table 1, the p38a activity for all, but one of the analogs was below 50 nM, indicating that the predictive model was an effective tool in the design of potent p38a inhibitors. However, the cellular activities (dWBA IC50) of these analogs were clearly dependent upon a compound's cell permeability and not predictive based on modeling. Interestingly, both a more hydrophobic analog 8 and a more polar analog 11 gave the worst cellular activities. The microsomal incubation study shows that only the diphenylmethane analog 9 and indazole analog 19 gave significantly lower levels of the debenzylated metabolite while maintaining potency. Analogs 7 and 10 yielded higher percentages of the debenzylated metabolite whereas 11 and 12 were much less stable under the microsomal incubation conditions. Finally, while microsomal digestion of analog 19, produced less than 5% of the corresponding debenzylated metabolite, its oral availability (determined in rat PK studies) was found to be much lower than expected. As this compound is structurally quite different than SCIO-469, its poor PK may be due to other factors. Further microsomal studies of the diphenylmethane analog 9 demonstrate that it is, in fact, more metabolically stable that SCIO-469. Additionally, this trend was observed in multiple species. While it was observed that metabolism of 9 also occurs at the dimethyl amide region of the molecule, a higher percentage of demethylated metabolite, compared to SCIO-469, was formed in every species (Table 2). Evaluation of compound 9 in in vivo PK studies indicated it has a bioavailability of 31% in rat and 33% in dog. Furthermore, PK parameters such as oral exposure, clearance and volume of distribution, measured in multiple species (Table 3), warranted consideration of compound 9 as a backup to SCIO-469. While lower exposure was observed in monkey, this was consistent with the increased amount of demethylated metabolite noted in the in vitro studies mentioned above. In summary, through efforts to discover backup molecules with improved pharmacokinetic profiles over SCIO-469, we identified the diphenylmethane group as a superior alternative to the 4-fluorobenzyl moiety in the indole-piperazine class of p38a MAP kinase inhibitors. This modification resulted in improved in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles compared to SCIO-469, presumably due to the sterically hindered environment around the site of metabolism. Furthermore, this steric hindrance suppressed the formation of a potential major metabolite while maintaining overall biological properties and potency against p38a MAP kinase.
