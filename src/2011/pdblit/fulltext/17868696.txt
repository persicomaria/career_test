In Vitro Evolution of a Hyperstable G1 Variant
Michael Wunderlich and Franz X. Schmid
Laboratorium für Biochemie und Bayreuther Zentrum für Molekulare Biowissenschaften, Universität Bayreuth, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany An in-vitro selection strategy was used to obtain strongly stabilized variants of the 1 domain of protein G (G1). In a two-step approach, first candidate positions with a high potential for stabilization were identified in G1 libraries that were created by error-prone PCR, and then, after randomization of these positions by saturation mutagenesis, strongly stabilized variants were selected. For both steps the in-vitro selection method Proside was employed. Proside links the stability of a protein with the infectivity of a filamentous phage. Ultimately, residues from the two best selected variants were combined in a single G1 molecule. This variant with the four mutations E15V, T16L, T18I, and N37L showed an increase of 35.1 °C in the transition midpoint and of 28.5 kJ mol-1 (at 70 °C) in the Gibbs free energy of stabilization. It was considerably more stable than the best variant from a previous Proside selection, in which positions were randomized that had originally been identified by computational design. Only a single substitution (T18I) was found in both selections. The best variants from the present selection showed a higher cooperativity of thermal unfolding, as indicated by an increase in the enthalpy of unfolding by about 60 kJ mol-1. This increase is apparently correlated with the presence of Leu residues that were selected at the positions 16 and 37.

Introduction
The stabilities of most natural proteins are only marginal, just high enough to maintain their functions in the organism. Three major strategies are currently used to improve protein stability: structure-guided design,1,2 computational design,3­7 or in vitro evolution.8­12 In in vitro evolution, libraries of protein variants are subjected to screening or selection steps in vivo or in vitro. The selection can be based on the maintenance of a specific function of the protein to be stabilized (such as enzymatic or binding activity) at increased temperature or denaturant concentration13­16 or on a more general

property such as the improved protease resistance of stabilized protein variants. 17­26 In our laboratory we use the in vitro selection method Proside (protein stability increased by directed evolution) to identify stabilized variants of proteins in phage libraries.17,20,24,25 Proside uses the relation between the thermodynamic stability of a protein and its resistance to proteolysis, which is linked with the infectivity of the filamentous phage fd.17 Infection of Escherichia coli by phage fd is mediated by its gene-3-protein (G3P), which consists of three domains. The C-terminal domain CT anchors G3P in the phage coat, the protruding N-terminal domains N1 and N2 attach the phage first to the F-pilus and then to the TolA receptor of the bacterial cell. The domains are connected by glycine-rich stretches of 18 and 39 amino acids, respectively, and this covalent linkage between the domains must remain intact for the infection.27 In Proside, a repertoire of sequences coding for the protein to be stabilized is inserted between the N2 and the CT domain of G3P. In the presence of a protease, the linkage between these two domains is maintained only when the inserted guest protein is not cleaved. Variants with increased

546 thermodynamic stability show an increased resistance towards proteolysis. The corresponding phage variants remain infectious, and thus they can be enriched in repeated cycles of in vitro proteolysis, infection of E. coli, and phage propagation. The proteolytic selection step is performed in vitro, therefore the conditions can be varied over a wide range, limited only by the stability of the phage and the protease. Here we employed a phage variant with a stabilized G3P, which is resistant to chymotrypsin up to 60 °C.21 G1, a domain of the streptococcal protein G,28­30 is used as a model to develop and test methods for optimizing protein stability by both computational and evolutionary approaches.31­34 G1 consists of 56 amino acids and, in its native state, forms a fourstranded antiparallel -sheet and an -helix (Figure 1). Mayo and co-workers used computational design to increase the stability of G1. Initially they optimized three core positions35 and then four partially exposed, "boundary" positions.31 The core re-design led to the triple mutant Y3F/L7I/V39I, the subsequent re-design at the four boundary positions Thr16, Thr18, Thr25 and Val29 led to ten nearly isoenergetic variants, and the best one (T16I/T18I/ T25E/V29I) showed an experimental stabilization by 15.9 kJ mol-1.31 We used G1 to evaluate the performance of our in vitro selection method Proside for protein stabilization.34 Phage libraries contain 106­108 variants, and therefore they represent only a tiny

fraction of all possible sequence variants even of a very small protein such as G1. It is thus mandatory to develop stepwise procedures, in which first promising positions for stabilization are identified, followed by finding the optimal residues for these positions. In previous work, we used different approaches to locate suitable positions. In the stabilization of a mesophilic cold shock protein, we employed the comparison with the sequence of a thermophilic homolog,20 and for the selection of stabilized variants of G1,25 we used four boundary positions that had been identified before by computational design.31 The variants obtained from this Proside selection were all strongly stabilized, and two of them showed a higher stability than then best variant from the computational design. Here we asked whether Proside selections could be used for both identifying positions with a potential for stabilization and finding the best amino acid replacements for these positions. To this end we first employed error-prone PCR to generate several independent G1 libraries with random mutations. After multiple rounds of Proside selections, five promising positions for stabilization could be identified in these libraries. In the next step, these positions were randomized simultaneously by saturation mutagenesis and the corresponding libraries again subjected to Proside selections. The manual combination of residues from the two best selected variants led to a fourfold mutant of G1 with an increase in TM of more than 35 °C and an

547 I6V and T53A as the template for the selections. They destabilize G1 by 10.0 kJ mol-1.25,36,37 To identify positions with a potential for stabilization, we generated five independent libraries of G1 by error-prone PCR and subjected them to Proside selections. After multiple selection rounds the G1 inserts of phage variants with increased protease resistance were sequenced (Table 1). We found mutations at 11 sites (Figure 1), and, except the mutations G9R and N37M (in library E3), all originated from single base changes. The selected mutations were then transferred into the gene for wild-type G1 (without the destabilizing mutations I6V and T53A) and the thermal stabilities of the corresponding protein variants were measured (Table 1). The N8Y/G9V double mutation was found in several variants and increased the protease resistance of the corresponding phage. Nevertheless, it destabilized the wild-

increase in stability by 28.5 kJ mol-1. This variant shows a much higher stability than the best mutant from the previous selection,25 which used positions that were identified computationally.31 Intriguingly, in both selections polar-to-non-polar substitutions at boundary positions turned out to be strongly stabilizing.

Results
Random mutagenesis With a TM value of 77 °C (at pH 7.0; Table 1), the wild-type form of G1 shows a higher thermostability than the phage G3P. To adapt G1 to the selection range in the Proside experiments, we used a G1 variant with the two destabilizing mutations

Five independent libraries were created by error-prone PCR (E1­E5) and subjected to several rounds of Proside selection. The data for wild-type G1 (wt) are given for comparison.

The origin for this unexpected result became clear when the N8Y/ G9V double mutation was introduced into the G1 template that was used for the selections. This variant with the mutations I6V and T53A is in fact stabilized by 4.2 °C when the N8Y and G9V mutations are present (Table 1). Residue 8 is very close to Val6 and Ala53 in the destabilized G1 template (Figure 1), and the aromatic side-chain of Tyr 8 probably interacts in a favorable fashion with Val 6 and/or Ala 53 in the template. The position 1 of G1 is peculiar. In the template used for the selections it is occupied by Asp as in the intact streptococcal protein G. For the expression of the isolated G1 domain in bacteria, this Asp is always replaced by a Met. The removal of Met1 destabilizes wild-type G1 by 7.1 kJ mol-1,38 and this preference for a non-polar residue explains probably why in library E5 the D1V mutation was selected. An Asp  Met mutation would have required three base changes. The mutation T11I was lost in later selection steps, the mutation K13I did not change the protein stability (compare the variants 13/1 and 13/3 of library E1; Table 1) and E56V, as a single mutation, was slightly destabilizing for wild-type G1. In library E1 we also found variants with the mutation A53E. This confirmed that the T53A mutation, which had been used to pre-destabilize G1 for the selections, is indeed destabilizing. The mutations T16I and T18I were found in library E2. They were strongly stabilizing and increased the TM value of wild-type G1 by 13 °C (Table 1). The three mutations E15V, A24V, and N37M stabilized wild-type G1 by 3.8 °C (compare the variants E113/1 and E3-17/1; Table 1).

Site-directed saturation mutagenesis The five positions 15, 16, 18, 24 and 37 were chosen for a joint randomization by saturation mutagenesis such that all 20 naturally occurring amino acids were allowed at these positions. Phage libraries contain up to 108 variants, and therefore five positions can be probed simultaneously. The other positions (1, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 56) were excluded for the reasons described above. Three independent libraries of G1 were established and used for 10 to 13 rounds of Proside selections. Ten clones with highly increased protease resistance were then taken from each library, and the corresponding G1 inserts were sequenced. The 30 selected clones showed different nucleotide sequences, which, at the amino acid level, coded for 11 different G1 variants (Table 2). The three independent selections led to similar results (Figure 2). At the positions 16 and 37 Leu residues were found in all 30 clones. At position 15, Val was selected most frequently, but polar residues (Glu, Thr, Ser, Gln) were found as well. At position 18 only aliphatic residues (Val, Ile, Leu) or Met were found, also with a preference for Val. For position 24 the selection did not really converge. Residues ranging in size from Gly to Trp were found as well as polar or positively charged residues. This diversity suggests that the nature of residue 24 is less important for the stability of G1. The selected residues were usually coded by different base triplets (Table 2; Figure 2). For both Leu16 and Leu37 five of the six Leu codons were found, for Val15 three, and for Val18 all four codons for Val were found. Several variants with identical amino acid sequence were coded by different nucleotide sequences. This indicates that the starting

libraries were sufficiently diverse and that the selection occurred at the protein level. Experimental characterization of the selected variants Ten of the 11 sets of stabilizing mutations were introduced into wild-type G1, and the thermal stabilities of the corresponding protein variants were determined. The stability of wild-type G1 is maximal at pH 5.5,39 and at this pH most of the selected variants showed TM values higher than 100 °C. Therefore, we measured all thermal unfolding transitions at pH 7.0 and in the presence of 1.5 M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). Under these conditions the TM of wild-type G1 is reduced from 77.0 °C to 51.2 °C. All the selected variants are strongly stabilized (Figure 3). Their TM values are increased by at least 22 °C and the corresponding GD values by at least 16 kJ mol-1 (Table 3). The two best variants (variants 1 and 2; Table 3) are stabilized by about 30 °C, equivalent to an increase in GD by 24 kJ mol-1.

The thermodynamic parameters were derived from thermal unfolding transitions as shown in Figure 3. The variants are ranked according to decreasing stabilities. The variants M1 and M2 represent manual combinations of the two most stable variants from the selection. The variant M3 is identical to M2, but Leu at position 16 is mutated to Ile as found in previous selections.25 The accuracies of TM and HD are ±0.2 °C and ±5 kJ mol-1, respectively. The accuracy of GD (70 °C) is correlated with TM. For variants with TM close to 70 °C the accuracy is ±0.3 kJ mol-1, for variants with 65 °C  TM  75 °C the accuracy is ±0.5 kJ mol-1. a TM is the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transitions. b HD is the enthalpy of unfolding at TM. c GD is the change in Gibbs free energy of unfolding at 70 °C. d GD is the change in Gibbs free energy relative to the wild-type protein.

At position 24, the wild-type residue Ala was found in variant 1, whereas in the variants 3, 4 and 5 this position was occupied by Arg, Thr, or Ser, respectively. These variants are only slightly less stable than variant 1, which confirms that the residue at position 24 is of minor importance for the thermal stability. At the positions 16 and 37, the two best variants both showed Leu residues. They differed, however, at the other three positions. Therefore, we examined whether the stability of G1 could be further increased by a manual combination of residues at the positions 15, 18, and 24. Variant 2 does not show the consensus residue Val15, which is found in four of the five best variants. We therefore replaced Glu15 in variant 2 by a Val to obtain variant M1. Indeed this replacement increased the TM value by almost 4 °C and GD by 3.3 kJ mol-1. Next, we changed Val24 to Ala24 as in the best selected variant (variant 1; Table 3). This mutation provided a further slight stabilization (by 0.9 °C or 1.1 kJ mol-1; compare variants M1 and M2 in Table 3). This suggests that Ala (as in the wild-type protein) is an adequate residue for position 24. M2 is our best variant. Its TM value is increased by 35.1 °C and GD by 28.5 kJ mol-1. In our previous selection25 the four boundary positions 16, 18, 25 and 29 were randomized, and Ile was identified as the optimal residue for position 16. In the present selections, however, we always found Leu at position 16. To examine this apparent discrepancy, we mutated Leu16 to Ile in our best variant. This destabilized the protein by 1.8 °C or 2.1 kJ mol-1 (cf. variants M2 and M3 in

Table 3), which suggests that the effects of the mutations at position 16 are slightly context dependent. The stabilities of the best variants (variants 1­4, M1 and M2) were also probed by GdmCl-induced unfolding (Figure 4). The measured increases in Gibbs free energy of unfolding relative to the wildtype protein (GD; Table 4) were similar to those obtained from the thermal transitions (Table 3).

The fractions of native proteins (represented by continuous lines) as obtained after a twostate analysis of the data are shown as a function of GdmCl concentration. The corresponding thermodynamic parameters are given in Table 4.

The stability data were derived from GdmCl-induced unfolding transitions as shown in Figure 4. The variants are numbered as in Table 3. The accuracies of m and GD(30 °C) are ±0.3 kJ mol-1 M-1 and ±1.5 kJ mol-1, respectively. a [GdmCl]m is the concentration of GdmCl at the midpoint of the transition. b The cooperativity value m represents the dependence of GD(30 °C) on the concentration of GdmCl. c GD(30 °C) is the Gibbs free energy of unfolding at 30 °C in the absence of GdmCl. d GD is the change in Gibbs free energy of unfolding relative to the wild-type protein.

Comparison of the variants found by computational design and by in vitro evolution Various computational and evolutionary approaches have been employed to increase the stability of G1. Initially, three core and four boundary positions were optimized computationally.31,35 Our group then used the four boundary positions, randomized them, and isolated the best variants by in vitro selections.25 Here we had employed in vitro selections first to identify promising positions and then to find the best amino acid residues for these positions. How do the results of these different approaches compare? To address this question, we measured the thermal stabilities of key variants from the different approaches under identical experimental conditions in the presence of 1.5 M GdmCl at pH 7.0 (Figure 5). The three core mutations Y3F, L7I, and V39I

identified by computational design stabilized G1 by 7.3 kJ mol-1 (Table 5; variant C3). The mutations T16I, T18I, T25E, and V29F at the four boundary positions, as found in the Proside selections, stabilized the protein by 14.5 kJ mol-1 (Table 5; variant B4). The combined sevenfold mutant C3B4 is stabilized by 22.7 kJ mol-1, indicating that the contributions of the core and the boundary mutations are additive. From the libraries that were constructed by errorprone PCR one strongly stabilized variant (Table 5; variant EP) could be selected directly. It contained the mutations T16I and T18I, and its stability was increased by 10.9 kJ mol-1. Positions 16 and 18 were also identified in the computational design, and both the stability calculations and the Proside selections had already identified Ile residues as good replacements. Thr can be changed by a single base change to Ile, and therefore the T16I/T18I variant was found in the libraries created by error-prone PCR. The best variant selected after the simultaneous randomization of the five positions 15, 16, 18, 24, and 37 (Table 5; variant 1) was stabilized by 23.8 kJ mol-1, equivalent to an increase in TM by 30.7 °C. In this variant, only the mutation E15V is identical to the mutations found initially by errorprone PCR. The best variant C3B4 from the former selection25 and variant 1 from this selection show similar TM values, but variant 1 shows a much higher enthalpy of unfolding, i.e. the cooperativity of unfolding is increased (Figure 5). The manual combination of the two best variants from the present selections led to mutant M2, which is stabilized by 28.5 kJ mol-1. This fourfold mutant is 5.8 kJ mol-1 more stable than C3B4, the sevenfold mutant that resulted from the previous combination of computational design and in vitro evolution.25,31 This difference in stability, determined at 70 °C is a conservative estimate. It increases with decreasing temperature because the unfolding of M2 is much more cooperative than the unfolding of C3B4. It should be noted that these two best variants share only a single common mutation (T18I).

The thermodynamic parameters were derived from thermal unfolding transitions as shown in Figure 5. The variants are explained in the text. The accuracies of TM and HD are ±0.2 °C and ±5 kJ mol-1, respectively. The accuracy of GD (70 °C) is correlated with TM. For variants with TM close to 70 °C the accuracy is ±0.3 kJ mol-1, for variants with 65 °C  TM  75 °C the accuracy is ±0.5 kJ mol-1. a Empty spaces signify identity with the wild-type protein (cf. first line). b TM is the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transitions. c HD is the enthalpy of unfolding at TM. d GD is the change in Gibbs free energy of unfolding at 70 °C. e GD is the change in Gibbs free energy of unfolding relative to the wild-type protein.

We also combined the best residues from the two selections. The mutations T25E and V29F, which were found by optimizing the four boundary positions, stabilize G1 by 3.6 kJ mol-1 (cf. variants B4 and EP). We introduced them into the best variant from this selection (M2), to generate variant M4, but its stability was only marginally increased (by 1.2 kJ mol-1; Table 5).

more cooperative. The increase in the enthalpy of unfolding might originate from an improved packing with more or stronger intra-molecular contacts in this stabilized variant. The course of the selection Most of the mutations that were introduced into G1 by error-prone PCR were C  T transversions or A  T transitions, as expected.40­42 About ten Proside rounds were sufficient to select the most stable variants from a particular library (Table 1), and three mutations were found in more than one library. Many selected variants contained several mutations, such as A24V and N37M, which were found together in library E3. Position 37 is critical for the stability, but position 24 is unimportant. This became evident after the position-specific randomizations (Figure 2). At position 24 many different residues were found, and the stabilities of the corresponding variants were very similar. The strongly stabilizing residues Ile16 and Ile18 were found in the primary libraries that were created by error-prone PCR, because the corresponding mutations T16I and T18I required only single base changes. Leu, the best residue for position 37 was found only after site-specific saturation mutagenesis. It was probably not found in the primary libraries, because the N37L mutation requires a two-base change. Intriguingly, the N37M mutation that initially led to the discovery of position 37 was also a two-base change. This illustrates that some promising mutations may be hard to find in libraries created by error-prone PCR, because they are inaccessible by single base changes. The conditions for in vitro selections, such as temperature or denaturant concentration, are limited by the viability of the organism used for the selection. The results with G1 show that predestabilization provides a good strategy to circumvent this limit and to select variants with TM value

Discussion
The strategy for stabilization The enormous sequence space even of a very small protein provides virtually unlimited possibilities for tailoring its properties by sequence variation, but, at the same time, poses the problem of finding the optimal sequences. Phage libraries show diversities of up to 108 particles, which implies that only five or six amino acid positions can be randomized simultaneously in proteins displayed on a phage. Therefore, we employ strategies in which first the promising positions and then the optimal residues for these positions are identified. In our previous approach to stabilize G1,25 we focused on four positions that had been discovered computationally by the Mayo group.31 Here we used Proside in vitro selections for both identifying the promising sites (in libraries of G1 mutants that were created by error-prone PCR) and obtaining the best residues (in libraries created by saturation mutagenesis at these sites). A combination of the two best selected variants resulted in the hyperstable fourfold mutant M2 that showed an increase in TM of 35.1 °C and an increase in GD of 28.5 kJ mol-1 at 70 °C. M2 was thus considerably more stable than the best variants from all previous approaches. The enthalpy of unfolding of M2 was also increased, making thermal unfolding

553 libraries that were created independently, first by error-prone PCR and then by saturation mutagenesis. Whether there are many more positions with a high stabilizing potential is a matter of speculation. The fact that our set of residues overlaps at two positions (16 and 18) with those found previously by computation31 suggests that the number of such positions is limited. Structural basis for the stabilization We discuss the stabilizing effects of the mutations on the basis of the structure of folded G1. Mutations can stabilize proteins also indirectly by destabilizing the unfolded state,43,44 and therefore this discussion might give an incomplete picture. The residues at positions 15, 16, 18 and 37 are all partially exposed in the wild-type protein. They are near each other on the same side of the folded protein but do not contact each other (Figure 6). Residues 15, 16 and 18 are in an edge strand (2) of the four-stranded  sheet of G1. The stabilization by the E15V mutation is probably explained by the difference in -sheet-forming propensity, which is very high for Val but very

above 100 °C (under physiological conditions). However, the results must be carefully analyzed to uncover mutations (such as those at the positions 8 and 9 of G1) that reversed the effects of the destabilizing mutations. These mutations were not useful for the further stabilization of wild-type G1, but they confirmed that Proside indeed selects very well for mutations that increase the stability of the guest protein in the phage G3P. The best variant that was produced by manual combination (M2) was not found in the selections. This seems surprising and might indicate that it had not been present in the libraries. The selective power of Proside decreases with increasing temperature and protease concentration, because near 60 °C the phage itself becomes sensitive to proteolytic inactivation. This explains, why several strongly stabilized variants persisted in the libraries (cf. Table 2), even after more than ten selection rounds. It probably also explains why M2 was not found in the collection of 30 clones that were sequenced. Even for a very small protein, such as G1, the sequence space can by no means be searched exhaustively. We identified several stabilizing mutations by performing multiple parallel selections with

Figure 6. Tertiary structure of wild-type G1. The wild-type residues of the stabilizing mutations E15V, T16L, T18I and N37L and the surrounding positions Lys4, Lys13, Phe30 and Tyr33 are shown in ball-and-stick representation.

554 low for Glu.38,45 This stabilization is smaller in the presence of the ionic denaturant GdmCl (compare the variants M1 and 2 in Tables 3 and 4), indicating that Glu15 provides an unfavorable Coulombic contribution to the stability of wild-type G1. The positions 16 and 18 are also in strand 2, and, in wild-type G1, both are occupied by Thr, which shows a high -sheet propensity.38,45 The -sheet propensity is similarly high for Ile, for Leu it is lower. Increased secondary structure preferences thus cannot explain the strong stabilizations caused by the T16L and T18I replacements. Thr18 is a partially exposed "boundary" residue. The stabilizing effect of the T18I mutation was identified by computational design31 and confirmed in the previous Proside selections.25 The side-chain of Thr18 is close to the phenyl ring of Phe30 (distance 3.9 Å), and favorable hydrophobic interactions between Ile18 and Phe30 probably explain the stabilizing effect of the T18I mutation (Figure 6). All selected variants contained Leu16 and Leu37, and both are the most stabilizing residues for these positions. Leu37 was discovered in this selection. Position 16 had been identified before as a good candidate for stabilization, but in both the computational design31 and the previous Proside selections25 an Ile residue was found as the best replacement for Thr16. It is unclear why, in the presence of Leu37, a Leu is also preferred at position 16. The C atoms of the residues 16 and 37 are separated by more than 10 Å, and therefore they cannot interact directly. An indirect interaction between Leu16 and Leu37 might, however, be mediated by Tyr33, which is located between the residues 16 and 37 (Figure 6). The formation of a hydrophobic cluster between the side-chains of Leu16, Tyr33 and Leu37 might thus explain the interdependence between the mutations T16L and N37L. A minor stabilization by 0.7 kJ mol-1 was observed previously for the N37A mutation.46 Mayo and co-workers classified position 37 as a boundary position47 but did not consider it in their computational design study.31 Thus, its strongly stabilizing potential was not identified.

from the comparisons between homologous proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms.55­59 In the Proside optimization of the cold shock protein CspB of Bacillus subtilis mostly charge substitutions were selected, because in the wild-type protein the charged residues are distributed asymmetrically. In G1 the charge distribution is better optimized, and the electrostatic interactions are overall stabilizing. In this case the strongest stabilization originated from the optimization of uncharged residues. Both computational design and in vitro selection identified partially exposed "boundary" positions as promising targets for stabilization, and at almost all positions, mutations of polar to non-polar aliphatic residues were strongly preferred. We suspect that the aliphatic residues with their differences in size and shape are very well suited to optimize side-chain packing. These substitutions also decreased the polarity of the surface, but did not compromise the solubility of the purified proteins. This might be different in the crowded environment within cells. An exhaustive sampling of the sequence space even of small proteins such as G1 is still beyond reach in both computational and experimental approaches. Therefore it is important to employ hierarchical approaches in which theoretical and experimental approaches are combined to identify first positions with a potential for stabilization and then the optimal residues for these positions.

Materials and Methods
Construction of phage libraries The G1 template used for library construction contained the two destabilizing mutations I6Vand T53A.25,36,37 Random mutations were inserted into the g1 gene by error-prone PCR. The g1 gene with the mutations I6V and T53A was amplified by using upstream and downstream-linker-primers22 in the presence of 0.25 mM Mn2+, reduced dNTP concentration (20 M) and Taq DNApolymerase. For the construction of libraries E2­E5 the Cterminal primer was extended into the C-terminal region of the gene (the codons for residues 53 to 56) to avoid the loss of the destabilizing T53A mutation during random mutagenesis. The repertoire of mutated DNA fragments encompassing the g1 gene were hybridized to the (+) DNA strand of phage, extended to the doublestranded form of the phage DNA by Pfu DNApolymerase and used to transform E. coli XL1Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA).22 For the saturation mutagenesis at the positions 15, 16, 18, 24 and 37 libraries of G1 genes were constructed by PCR using one oligonucleotide with degenerate codons (NNN) for the amino acid positions 15, 16, 18 and 24 and a second oligonucleotide with a degenerate codon (NNN) for amino acid position 37. The resulting repertoires of PCR fragments were then introduced into the phage fd as described above. The theoretical diversity of these libraries was 3.6×106 at the protein level. The initial libraries of 1.5×107­6.0×107 transformants should thus have been sufficiently large to contain all possible residue combinations at the randomized positions.

Conclusions
Computational optimization of the interior of G135 led to an only modest increase in stability, and, in this work, we could not find stabilizing mutations in the core. This confirms that the protein interior is usually well packed and not easily improved by single mutations.19,24,26,48,49 Only in the presence of obvious packing defects, such as void volumes50,51 or buried charges52 could proteins be stabilized by optimizing the corresponding residues in their interiors. Substitutions at or near the protein surface can be strongly stabilizing. Such a high potential for stabilization at the surface emerged also from other protein optimization studies20,24,53,54 and

In vitro Evolution of a Hyperstable G1 Variant Proside selections The selections were performed essentially as described.22 After 2 min incubations in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) at different temperatures the phage were exposed to 0.25 M chymotrypsin for 15 min at the same temperature in a total volume of 50 l. To propagate the phage that remained infectious, the solution was added to a growing culture of E. coli TG1. For the phage libraries created by random mutagenesis the temperature was raised from 40 °C to 55 °C during the selection and the concentration of chymotrypsin was increased from 0.25 M to 2.5 M. For the phage libraries created by saturation mutagenesis the temperature was raised from 40 °C to 57.5 °C and the chymotrypsin concentration from 0.25 M to 25 M. Protein purification DNA fragments coding for the selected G1 variants were amplified by PCR with primers coding for the N and the C-terminal region. These primers did not code for the destabilizing mutations I6V and T53A. The primer for the N-terminal region also contained the mutations D1M and T2Q. The T2Q mutation was introduced to prevent the loss of the N-terminal methionine.38 Additionally, restriction sites for NdeI at the N terminus and BamHI at the C terminus were included. The sequence motif Tyr8/Val9 that was found in the selections after random mutagenesis was additionally introduced into the G1 variant with the two destabilizing mutations I6V and T53A. The genes for the G1 variants were cloned into the plasmid pET11a (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). After DNA precipitation by poly(ethyleneimine), the supernatant was incubated at either 60 °C or 70 °C for 20 min to precipitate heat-labile proteins. This step was omitted in the purification of the variants that contained the destabilizing mutations at position 6 and 53. The G1 variants were purified by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration as described.38 Thermally and chemically induced unfolding transitions Thermal unfolding transitions of 4 M protein in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate­HCl (pH 7.0) were followed by circular dichroism at 222.6 nm with 1 nm bandwidth in 10 mm cells using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter equipped with a PTC-348 WI Peltier device. The stabilities of the variants that were selected from the libraries made by error-prone PCR were measured in buffer without denaturant. Those obtained from the libraries made by sequence-specific randomization were measured in the presence of 1.5 M GdmCl. The data were analyzed according to a two-state model using non-linear regression and the program Grafit (Erithacus Software, Staines, UK), the heat capacity change Cp was kept constant at 4000 J mol-1 K-1. The reversibility of thermal unfolding was examined by heating protein samples for 5 min at a temperature that was 10 °C above its TM value, cooling it to 15 °C and subsequent thermal unfolding. The transitions were identical with those obtained without pre-heating. For the GdmCl-induced unfolding transitions 1-M samples of the G1 variants were incubated for 2 h in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate­HCl (pH 7.0) and varying

555
concentrations of GdmCl. The emission at 342 nm (bandwidth 10 nm) after excitation at 280 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) was measured at 30 °C in 10 mm cells with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The experimental data were analyzed according to a two-state model and by assuming a linear dependence of the fluorescence emission on the GdmCl concentration. A non-linear leastsquares fit of the experimental data was used to obtain the Gibbs free energy of denaturation GD as a function of the GdmCl concentration.60
