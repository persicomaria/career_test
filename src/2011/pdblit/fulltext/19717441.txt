Plexin cell surface receptors bind to semaphorin ligands and transduce signals for regulating neuronal axon guidance. The intracellular region of plexins is essential for signaling and contains a R-Ras/M-Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain that is divided into two segments by a Rho GTPase-binding domain (RBD). The regulation mechanisms for plexin remain elusive, although it is known that activation requires both binding of semaphorin to the extracellular region and a Rho-family GTPase (Rac1 or Rnd1) to the RBD. Here we report the crystal structure of the plexin A3 intracellular region. The structure shows that the N- and C-terminal portions of the GAP homologous regions together form a GAP domain with an overall fold similar to other Ras GAPs. However, the plexin GAP domain adopts a closed conformation and cannot accommodate R-Ras/M-Ras in its substrate-binding site, providing a structural basis for the autoinhibited state of plexins. A comparison with the plexin B1 RBD/Rnd1 complex structure suggests that Rnd1 binding alone does not induce a conformational change in plexin, explaining the requirement of both semaphorin and a Rho GTPase for activation. The structure also identifies an N-terminal segment that is important for regulation. Both the N-terminal segment and the RBD make extensive interactions with the GAP domain, suggesting the presence of an allosteric network connecting these three domains that integrates semaphorin and Rho GTPase signals to activate the GAP. The importance of these interactions in plexin signaling is shown by both cell-based and in vivo axon guidance assays.
autoinhibition axon guidance signaling structure

lexins are a large family of type I transmembrane receptors for semaphorin axon guidance molecules. Repulsive signals from semaphorin-bound plexins are critical for proper axonal pathfinding and target innervation during neural development, and also play important roles in regulating cell migration, vascular patterning, and immune responses [reviewed in (1­3)]. Malfunction of plexin signaling has been implicated in diseases such as neurological disorders and cancer, and plexins have emerged as new drug targets for these diseases (4). All four classes of plexins (A, B, C, and D) share a similar domain structure, with an extracellular region that binds the semaphorin ligand, a single transmembrane helix and an approximately 600 residue-long intracellular region that transduces signals from the ligand-bound extracellular region to downstream pathways. Studies of the plexin intracellular region have led to the identification of a number of signaling pathways [reviewed in (1, 2, 5)]. Of particular interest is the recognition that the plexin intracellular region exhibits sequence similarity to Ras GTPase-activating proteins (Ras GAPs), representing the first example of a transmembrane receptor containing a GAP domain (6, 7). R-Ras, a homologue of Ras involved in regulating cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth, is a substrate of the plexin GAP (8, 9). Conversion of R-Ras into the GDP-bound inactive form by the plexin GAP leads to decreased activity of integrin and loss of cell adhesion, contributing to repulsive axon guidance. A recent study shows that the plexin GAP also acts on another Ras homolog M-Ras, leading to remodeling of

dendrite morphology (10). The GAP activity is important for plexin signaling, and plexin function is lost upon mutation of either of the two conserved catalytic arginine residues (7­9, 11). The GAP domain of plexins is unique in that it is divided into two segments, referred to as C1 and C2 respectively, by a domain of approximately 200 residues that does not show homology to Ras GAPs. The C1 and C2 regions each contain one of the two catalytic arginine residues (12), and the mechanism through which these two arginines are positioned precisely in close proximity for catalysis is not known (13). The domain between C1 and C2 in class A and B plexins binds Rho-family GTPases Rac1, Rnd1, or RhoD in their GTP-bound active form, and is called the Rho GTPase binding domain (RBD) (7, 14­16). A recent study shows that plexin D1 RBD binds another Rho GTPase Rnd2, whereas the Rho GTPase specific for the class C plexin has yet to be identified (17). The structures of the core region of the plexin B1 RBD and its complex with Rnd1 have been solved [PDB ID: 2REX, (18, 19)]. The RBD core adopts an ubiquitin-like fold and binds Rnd1 through one edge of its -sheet. Mutational analyses suggest that Rac1 and RhoD bind to the RBD in the same mode (18). Plexins behave as logic ``AND'' gates during signal transduction, as their activation requires concomitant binding of semaphorin to the extracellular region and one of the Rho GTPases to the RBD (9­11, 14, 20). The GAP activity of the plexin cytoplasmic domains can be induced by simultaneous binding of Rnd1 and an clusterinducing antibody, whereas no activity was detected in the absence of either (8, 11). While semaphorins may contribute to plexin activation by inducing a change in its oligomerization state (8, 11, 21, 22), the mechanism by which the Rho GTPases facilitate the activation process remains unclear. A conformational change associated with GAP activation has been suggested by studies that show interactions between C1 and C2, and dissociation of the two upon RhoGTPase binding to the RBD (11, 20). Central questions concerning plexin signaling mechanisms include how the separated C1 and C2 regions interact with each other to form a functional GAP domain, and how GAP activity is regulated by semaphorins and Rho GTPases. To address these questions we determined the crystal structure of the intracellular domain of plexin A3, one of the most widely expressed plexins in the nervous system (23). The structure shows that C1 and C2 of plexin fold in an intertwined manner to form a GAP domain that has an overall fold similar to other Ras GAPs (12). Structural comparisons suggest that the plexin GAP is in an autoinhibited state, and Rho GTPase binding alone does not appear

to be able to induce its activation. The structure also identifies a previously unnoted N-terminal segment. The GAP domain is coupled to both the N-terminal segment and the RBD through conserved inter-domain interactions, which were shown to be critical for signaling by our functional assays, providing insights into the plexin activation mechanism involving binding of both semaphorin and a Rho GTPase. Results
Structure of the Intracellular Domain of Plexin A3. We have solved a

2.0-Å crystal structure of the intact intracellular region of plexin A3 (residues 1,247­1,872). Despite the unusual divided domain structure and low sequence similarity to other Ras GAPs ( 21% identity and 29% similarity to p120 Ras GAP) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1), the two GAP homologous regions C1 and C2 of plexin A3 form a GAP domain with an overall fold similar to canonical Ras GAPs such as p120 Ras GAP (Fig. 1 B and C) (12, 24, 25). The two catalytically critical arginine residues in plexin A3, Arg-1407 and Arg-1724, superimpose precisely with those in p120 Ras GAP (Fig. 1C). The structure identifies unambiguously the boundaries of the C1 (residues 1,325­1,450) and C2 (residues 1,651­1,872) regions of plexin A3 (Fig. S1). The plexin A3 GAP does show important structural differences when compared to other Ras GAPs, which will be discussed in detail below. The RBD segment (residues 1,451­1,650) between C1 and C2 extends out of the GAP domain and adopts an independent ubiquitin-like fold, similar to that of the isolated plexin B1 RBD

reported previously (Fig. 1 A and B) (18). The ubiquitin-like RBD core (residues 1,478­1,578) is connected to C1 and C2 by two linkers, the N-terminal linker (residues 1,451­1,477) and Cterminal linker (residues 1,579­1,650), respectively (Fig. 1 A). The RBD interacts with the GAP domain through one edge but the area that binds Rho GTPases is entirely accessible (Fig. 1B and see details below). The structure reveals a previously unrecognized N-terminal segment (residues 1,246­1,324), which is not part of the GAP homology region and does not show noticeable sequence similarity to proteins outside of the plexin family (Fig. 1 A and B and Fig. S1). This N-terminal segment adopts an extended helix-loop-helix-loop structure and makes extensive interactions with the GAP domain (Fig. 1B and see details below).
Autoinhibition Mechanism of the Plexin GAP Domain. The plexin A3

GAP domain adopts an overall elongated and curved shape similar to other Ras GAPs, with the active site containing Arg-1407 and Arg-1724 located at the concaved surface. However, the Ras substrate-binding cleft in the plexin A3 GAP is narrower and deeper than that of p120 Ras GAP (Fig. 1C). Other Ras GAP structures such as synGAP and neurofibromin all adopt the same open, active conformation as that of p120 Ras GAP (Fig. S2B). A recently deposited structure of the plexin B1 intracellular region (PDB ID: 3HM6) shows a closed conformation essentially identical to plexin A3 (Fig. S2 A), suggesting that this conformation is a favored resting state of the plexin family members.

BIOCHEMISTRY

Fig. 2. The dimer of the plexin B1 RBD core reported previously (2R2O) mimics an intra-molecular interaction between the RBD core and the Cterminal linker in plexin A3.

The ``closed'' substrate-binding site of plexin A3 is mainly due to helices 4 and 5, which are taller than their counterparts in p120 Ras GAP, and large inward/downward shifts of helices 14 and 15 on the other side of the active site (Fig. 1C). Docking a Ras molecule onto the plexin A3 GAP based on the structure of p120 Ras GAP/Ras complex results in many steric clashes (Fig. 1D) (13). Given the high degree of structural similarity among Ras homologues, these clashes are likely to be present when R-Ras or M-Ras is docked. Therefore, this conformation of the plexin A3 GAP domain cannot bind its R-Ras/M-Ras substrate in a productive mode. This autoinhibited conformation explains the lack of GAP activity of plexins in the absence of upstream stimuli (8, 11). A significant conformational change is required for the plexin GAP to convert to the active conformation as seen in p120 Ras GAP.
Oligomerization State of Plexin-Intracellular Domain. Dimerization

or higher order clustering plays an important role in regulating plexin signaling (8, 11, 21). The plexin intracellular regions weakly dimerize in solution (Fig. S3). To gain insights into the nature of this dimer and its potential role in plexin regulation, we analyzed dimeric interactions in crystal structures of plexins. The plexin A3 crystals contain several putative dimers. Mutational analyses in combination with sequence considerations however suggest that none of these represents the plexin dimer seen in solution (Fig. S3 and Table S1). A dimer of the plexin B1 RBD core has been reported previously (18). The interface is mediated by the extra -hairpin outside of the ubiquitin-like fold, which form a short four-stranded -sheet between the two monomers (Fig. 2). The -hairpin in the structure of the full length plexin A3 intracellular region does not make such a dimeric interaction. Instead, it forms an intra-molecular fourstranded -sheet with a segment in the C-terminal linker (Fig. 2), which is not present in the plexin B1 RBD core protein. We conclude that this dimer of the plexin B1 RBD core mimics the missing intra-molecular interaction, and the full-length plexin intracellular region is unlikely to form such a dimer. Consistently, the same intra-molecular interaction, instead of the dimer, is present in the structure of the full-length plexin B1 intracellular region (Fig. S2 A). The true nature of the preformed dimer of the plexin intracellular domain and its role in plexin signaling remain to be determined.

Leu-1464 in the N-terminal linker places its side chain into a hydrophobic pocket formed by helices 9, 11, 15, and 16 in the GAP domain. In addition, Ile-1453, Tyr-1462, and Leu-1469 also contribute to the RBD/GAP interface. The C-terminal linker is largely disordered, except for the segment between residues 1,626­1,636, which forms the short -sheets with the extra loop from the RBD

A conserved 1631HLV1633 motif in this segment points their sidechains toward the domain interior, connecting interior packing in the N-terminal linker and the RBD core (Fig. 3A). The RBD core also makes numerous contacts with the GAP domain, mainly through buried polar residues (Fig. 3A). Most residues in the RBD/GAP interface are conserved, suggesting important functional roles for these interactions (Fig. S1).

induce 20% cell collapse, close to a negative control mutant which contains a double R1407/1408A mutation in the catalytic site and is known to be incapable of signaling (7­9, 11). We have also tested the L1464G-equivalent mutation in Drosophila plexin A (L1524G) in an in vivo axon guidance assay (26). Overexpressed neuronal wild-type plexin A generates axon guidance defects in Drosophila, whereas a plexin A mutant without the cytoplamic domain does not cause such effects (Fig. 3C). Likewise, the L1524G mutation eliminates plexin A-induced guidance defects (Fig. 3C), consistent with the results from the collapse assay. These results together demonstrate that the interaction between the RBD and the GAP domain is critical for plexin signaling. To understand how Rnd1 or other RBD-binding Rho GTPases contribute to plexin activation through this coupling between the RBD and the GAP domain, we compared plexin A3 with structures of the full-length plexin B1 intracellular region, the plexin B1 RBD core, and its complex with Rnd1 (Fig. 4) (18). Rnd1 binds to one side of the RBD corresponding to strands 3, 4, the following short -hairpin, and the surrounding loops in the plexin A3 intracellular region (Fig. 4A and C). Residues in the RhoGTPase binding site are conserved among class A and B plexins, suggesting that they all bind Rnd1, Rac1, and RhoD in the same manner. Class C and D plexins however contain several distinct residues in the binding site (Fig. 4C), explaining their different Rho GTPase specificities (17). The entire RBD core, including the Rho GTPase binding site, is essentially identical in the Rnd1-bound and the three apo-structures (Fig. 4A and B), suggesting that binding of Rnd1 (and likely other Rho GTPases) alone cannot induce a significant conformational change in plexin. The RBD-bound Rho GTPase however may be able to facilitate the conformational change required for activation in the context of the plexin dimer/oligomer induced by semaphorin, allowing plexins to function as a logic ``AND'' gate in signal transduction (14).

The RhoGTPase binding site in the RBD is located on the opposite side of the domain that interacts with the GAP domain. A superimposition of plexin A3 and the plexin B1 RBD/Rnd1 complex placed Rnd1 far away from the GAP domain (Fig. 4A). Given the extensive interactions between the RBD and the GAP domain, it is unlikely that the relative orientation between the two can change sufficiently to allow Rnd1 to regulate the GAP domain directly. Instead, The RBD/GAP interactions may establish an allosteric network to facilitate the indirect communication between the RBD-bound Rho GTPase and the GAP domain. This model predicts that disruption of the RBD/GAP interface would prevent plexin activation. We made four interface mutants of plexin A3 (I1453R and L1464G in the N-terminal linker, Q1506A in the RBD core and H1631A/L1632A in the C-terminal linker), and tested their activity by using a COS-7 cell-based collapse assay (Table S1) (22). Cells expressing the wild-type plexin A3 exhibit robust collapse ( 60%) after stimulation by the Sema3F ligand (Fig. 3B). The four mutants

The structure shows that the N-terminal segment also makes extensive interactions with the GAP domain, which may enable it to regulate the GAP conformation in response to semaphorin binding in the extracellular region. The first helix in the N-terminal segment interacts with the curved outer surface of one side of the GAP domain by undertaking a kink between residues Ala-1269 and Leu-1270 (Fig. 5B). Portions flanking this kink are anchored to helices 9, 11, and 16 in the GAP domain by both non-polar and electrostatic interactions (Fig. 5A and B). Helices 9, 11, and 16 also participate in the hydrophobic pocket that binds Leu-1464 in the RBD (Fig. 3A). These interactions therefore indirectly connect the N-terminal segment and the RBD. The loop following the first helix contains a 1295IPFL1298 motif, which makes hydrophobic interaction with residues including Phe-1438 and Phe-1737 in the GAP domain (Fig. 5B). Immediately following this loop is the second, shorter helix, which is located at the junction between the two sides that shape the concaved GAP active site. This amphiphathic helix interacts with the GAP domain through its hydrophobic side containing aromatic residues Tyr-1300, Tyr-1303, and Phe-1309. Most residues in the N-terminal segment contacting the GAP domain are conserved (Fig. 5A), suggesting important functional roles for these inter-domain interactions. To test this, we performed mutational analyses using the same functional assays mentioned above. Four mutants, M1261R, L1279R, Y1300A, and F1309A, were examined in the cell collapse assay. While the M1261R mutation appears to have no effect, the other three mutations reduce the levels of collapse close to that of the R1407/1408A mutant (Fig. 5C). We also analyzed the M1320R and L1338R mutations in Drosophila plexin A, corresponding to M1261R and L1279R in plexin A3, respectively, using the in vivo axon guidance assay. Consistent with the results from the collapse assay, the M1320R mutant remained partially active, and the L1338R mutation eliminated the repulsive effects of plexin A in axons (Fig. 5D).

These results together suggest that the N-terminal segment is not just a passive linker between the extracellular and the intercellular regions, but plays an important role in regulating plexin activity through its interactions with the GAP domain. Discussion The unusual divided architecture of the plexin GAP homology regions and their low sequence similarity to other Ras GAPs has raised the question of whether plexin is indeed a Ras GAP (6, 7, 27). Our structure of plexin A3 shows that the C1 and C2 regions do form a canonical Ras GAP domain, providing a structural basis for the recently observed R-Ras/M-Ras GAP activity of plexin (9, 10). The GAP domain in this structure however exhibits an inactive conformation, representing an autoinhibited state of the plexin intracellular region. In contrast, structures of several other Ras GAP domains all show the active conformation (13, 24, 25), and regulation of their activity often involves direct blocking of the active site by regulatory domains in the proteins (28). The observations of both active and inactive conformations suggest a distinct regulation mechanism for Ras GAPs. The GAP domain may exist in equilibrium between the two conformations, and other domains/ proteins allosterically regulate its activity by trapping one conformation and shifting the balance between the two without interacting with the catalytic site directly.

A critical remaining question is how plexin is activated by semaphorin and a Rho GTPase binding. A well-studied signaling mechanism of receptors is ligand-induced dimerization of receptor tyrosine kinases, in which the two kinase monomers activate each other by transphosphorylation of one or several regulatory tyrosines (29). Dimerization can also promote inter-molecular interactions that allosterically induce the active conformation, as exemplified by the EGF receptor kinase (30). Small GTPases trigger downstream signaling through recruiting their effectors to the proper location and/or inducing their active conformation (31). In the case of plexins, however, neither semaphorin nor the Rho GTPases alone are sufficient for activation (9­11, 14, 20). Our structural analyses support this by showing that the Rho GTPases do not appear to induce any conformational change in the GAP domain or interact with the GAP active site directly. Our data are consistent with an allosteric activation mechanism involving both of them, which is critically dependent on the tight coupling between the N-terminal segment, the GAP domain and the RBD in the plexin intracellular region. Elucidation of this allosteric mechanism requires further studies, especially structural analyses of plexin in the active conformation bound to both a Rho GTPase and the R-Ras/M-Ras substrate.

He et al.

(residues 1,247­1,872) were cloned into a modified pET28 vector (Novagen), which expresses the target protein with a N-terminal His6-Sumo protein tandem tag. Mutants of plexins were generated by Quickchange reactions (Stratagene). The proteins were expressed in the bacterial strain ArcticExpress (Stratagene) by following the manufacture's instruction. The protein was purified using a HisTrap 1-mL column (GE Healthcare). The His6-Sumo tag was removed by treatment of a Sumo-specific protease Ulp1. The proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography, concentrated to approximately 10 mg/mL and stored under 70 °C. Seleno-methoinine replaced plexin A3 was expressed in the same bacterial strain using the protocol as described by Van Duyne et al. (32). Native PAGE were performed using 10 ­20% Tris-HCl gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination. Initial crystallization trials of native plexin A3 at 5 mg/mL were performed through sitting drop vapor diffusion in the 96-well format. The initial condition (100 mM Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaNO3, and 20% PEG3350) was optimized by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Best crystals were obtained by mixing plexin A3 (2­5 mg/mL) and the crystallization buffer (100 mM Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.75, 100 mM NaNO3, and 15% PEG3350) at 1:1 volume ratio. Seleno-methionine replaced crystals were obtained in similar conditions. Both the native and seleno-methionine singlewavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) datasets were collected at beamline 19BM in the Advanced Photon Source. The diffraction data were processed using the program HKL2000 (33). The SAD dataset was used for solving the structure and ab initio model building using the Autosol and Autobuild Wizards in the Phenix package, respectively (34). The structure was then refined against the native dataset by iterative manual model building in Coot and refinement using the Phenix refinement module (34, 35). The statistics of data collection and structure refinement are summarized in Table S2. COS-7 Cell Collapse Assay. The cell collapse assay is based on the ability of plexins expressed on the surface of COS-7 cells to trigger cell collapse when activated by semaphorin (22). While plexin A3 failed to induce collapse in a previous study (36), we observed robust collapse by increasing the concentrations of semaphorin and the duration of the stimulation. Full-length plexin A3 and and its co-receptor neuropilin 2 with a C-terminal myc-tag were cloned into the pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vectors, respectively. Point mutations of plexin A3 were generated by QuikChange reactions (Stratagene). The plasmid encoding the plexin A3 ligand semaphorin 3F fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP-Sema3F) (a kind gift from Dr. Roman Giger) was transfected into HEK-293 cells for pro-

ducing the ligand. COS-7 cells were seeded into six-well plates at a density of approximately 1.2 105 cells/well 1 day before transfection. Transfection were performed by using Fugene6 (Roche) with a ratio of Fugene: plexin: neuropilin at 4.5 L:0.9 g:0.6 g. Two days after transfection, cells were treated with APSema3F at 3­5 nM concentration at 37 °C for approximately 90 min. Cells expressing both plexin A3 and neuropilin 2 bound AP-Sema3F and were stained by the BCIP/NBT substrates. The staining results showed that both the wild-type plexin A3 and the mutants were expressed on the cell surface. The ratio of collapsed cells and the total number of stained cells was taken as the percentage of cell collapse. Each experiment was repeated three times and more than 200 cells were counted each time. In Vivo Axon Guidance Assay. Mutants of Drosophila plexin A were cloned into the Drosophila transformation vector HAplexin A pUAST (37). Multiple independent transgenic fly lines containing these HA-tagged plexin A proteins were generated (BestGene, Inc.) and examined for expression and in vivo function using standard approaches. Analysis of alterations in plexin A-dependent axon guidance was performed as described previously, based on the observation that overexpressed plexin A in neurons using the ELAV-GAL4 driver enhances axonaxon repulsion, leading to abnormal axon separation and crossing of the midline of the central nervous system (CNS) (26). Low level overexpression of plexin A (1 copy) in a wild-type background generate relatively minor CNS axon guidance defects. Under this sensitized genetic background, expression of an additional copy of plexin A robustly increases the number of defects, providing a sensitive in vivo assay for plexin A signaling. Stage 16 or later embryos expressing an additional copy of the plexin A or mutants were collected at 30 °C and immunostained to visualize CNS axons with the Fasciclin II antibody (1D4; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). ``Thick'' axonal bundles exiting the longitudinals/crossing the CNS midline were counted in 10 embryos/genotype ( 90 segments).
