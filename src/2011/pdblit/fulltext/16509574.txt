A novel class of highly selective inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase was discovered from high throughput screening. The synthesis and optimization of a series of 5-amino-N-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl-3-phenylmethanones is described. An X-ray crystal structure of this series bound in the ATP binding pocket of unphosphorylated p38R established the presence of a unique hydrogen bond between the exocyclic amine of the inhibitor and threonine 106 which likely contributes to the selectivity for p38. The crystallographic information was used to optimize the potency and physicochemical properties of the series. The incorporation of the 2,3-dihydroxypropoxy moiety on the pyrazole scaffold resulted in a compound with excellent druglike properties including high oral bioavailability. These efforts identified 63 (RO3201195) as an orally bioavailable and highly selective inhibitor of p38 which was selected for advancement into Phase I clinical trials.
Introduction Continued interest in development of small molecule inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase is based on the central role this enzyme plays in inflammatory cell signaling. It is known that activation of p38 leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-R and IL-1 .1 Human clinical trials with biologic agents which neutralize TNF (etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab) or IL-1 (anakinra) have validated the concept that modulation of these cytokines leads to dramatic improvement in inflammatory diseases such as RA, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease.2 While these biologic agents have revolutionized the treatment of some inflammatory disorders, their high cost and inconvenient dosing regimens creates the need for safe and effective orally active inhibitors of TNF and/ or IL-1. Several excellent reviews describing the potential importance of p38 inhibitors as novel therapeutics in inflammatory disorders have been published.3 To date, however, only a small number of inhibitors of p38 have been reported to have advanced into phase II clinical trials. Only Vertex has reported a correlation between inhibition of p38 and therapeutic benefit in RA patients.4 A number of other agents have established a correlation between inhibition of p38 and inhibition of TNF and/or IL1 in phase I studies in healthy volunteers.5 Herein, we describe one part of our overall strategy to identify multiple novel scaffolds as inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase.

previously reported on the design and synthesis of 4-azaindoles as potent and selective inhibitors of p38.6 In this manuscript, we describe our efforts to optimize a lead identified through high throughput screening (HTS), 4-benzoyl-5-aminopyrazole. Several benzoyl containing amino pyrazoles were identified in our HTS campaign, including compound 1 with an IC50 ) 2.3 µM. Early crystallographic efforts resulted in cocrystal structures of the pyrazole series bound to unphosphorylated p38 MAP kinase. These X-ray structures revealed a novel interaction in the ATP binding site. In particular, the amine forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain hydroxyl of threonine 106, a residue not prevalent in most human kinases, which we hypothesized might impart a high degree of selectivity to the series. The structure also identified portions of the lead molecule which could be readily substituted to optimize the physicochemical properties of the series without loss of intrinsic potency. This paper highlights our strategy utilizing structural data to drive lead optimization and to ultimately identify 63 (RO3201195), a highly selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of p38. Chemistry Two synthetic routes to the (5-amino-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol4-yl)phenylmethanone scaffold were developed (Schemes 1 and 2). The principle approach began with the corresponding methyl benzoate 6. Addition of the lithium anion derived from acetonitrile provided cyano ketone 7 in good yield. Ketone 7 reacted with N-phenylformamidine to form enamine 8 in high yields. Treatment of 8 with the corresponding hydrazine proceeded with high regioselectivity and exclusively cyclized onto the nitrile to form pyrazole compounds 1 and 9-21. Alternatively, the pyrazoles could be assembled according to the route highlighted in Scheme 2. This approach allowed the benzoyl ring to be added at a later stage of the synthesis.

a Reagents: (a) CH CN, LDA, THF; (b) C H N:CHNHC H , xylenes, 3 6 5 6 5 reflux; (c) appropriately substituted phenylhydrazine, ethanol.

Condensation of ethyl (ethoxymethylene)cyanoacetate with 4-fluorophenyl hydrazine 22 in ethanol formed pyrazole carboxylate esters directly. Saponification of the ester with lithium hydroxide in methanol provided 5-amino-4-carboxypyrazole 23. Activation of the acid by conversion to the 2-thiopyridyl ester afforded intermediate 24 which was directly reacted with substituted phenylmagnesium bromides in THF7 to give ketones 25 and 26. Subsequent deprotection of the silyl ether with TBAF gave 27 which was then converted to the mesylate 28 under standard conditions. Treatment of 28 with sodium azide and potassium carbonate in DMF,8 followed by Staudinger reduction with triphenylphosphine, provided analogue 29.9 Alternatively, nucleophilic displacement of the mesylate 28 with 1-methylpiperazine under basic conditions in DMF gave compound 30. Elaboration of the aroyl ring using various coupling technologies is described in Schemes 3 and 4. Coupling of aryl halide 16 or 19 with alkynes under Sonogashira coupling conditions10 gave derivatives 31-38. Alternatively, Heck reactions with halide 16 provided olefins 41-44 in good yield. Hydrogenations of the unsaturated side chains using catalytic palladium on carbon afforded derivatives 45-48. Finally, Stille coupling11 with iodide 18 and vinyltributyltin gave styrene 49. Dihydroxylation of 49 with osmium tetroxide12 gave the desired diol 50 in good yields. Alternatively, Suzuki coupling of aryl halides could be used to access compounds 51-58 as described in Scheme 4. Coupling of pyridylboronic acids with halides 16, 17 or 19 produced compounds 51-55. The N-oxide analogue 56 was produced via oxidation of 55 with mCPBA in dichloromethane. Preparation of analogues 57 and 58 started from iodo derivative 18. Suzuki coupling between (2-bromoallyloxymethyl)benzene and iodide 18 via in situ boronate formation13 provided intermediate 57 in

acceptable yield. Subsequent oxidation with osmium tetroxide followed by catalytic hydrogenation to remove the benzyl protecting group furnished compound 58. Preparation of oxygen linked derivatives is shown in Scheme 5. Deprotection of the methoxy group of 20 with boron tribromide provided phenol 59 which served as an intermediate for the preparation of analogues 61-63. Analogue 61 was prepared by Mitsunobu coupling of phenol 58 with bromoethanol followed by subsequent halide displacement with piperidine. Alternatively, alkylation of phenol 59 with (R)- or (S)O-isopropylideneglycerol tosylate followed by deprotection of the acetal with p-toluenesulfonic acid gave chiral alcohols 62 and 63. Results and Discussion Initial Lead Identification. HTS was performed using a radioactive filtration binding format using [33P] ATP (250 µM) and myelin basic protein (150 µM) as the substrate. Compounds were initially tested at 40 µM, and those which displayed >40% inhibition of the enzyme activity were retested in the same format at multiple concentrations. Several benzoyl amino pyrazoles were identified in our HTS campaign, including compound 1, which was confirmed to have an IC50 ) 2.3 µM. To our knowledge, this was the first example of this scaffold to be identified as an inhibitor of a protein kinase. Preliminary SAR studies revealed that only small hydrophobic substituents on the N-phenylpyrazole ring were tolerated (Table 1). It was found that substitution at the para position of the phenyl ring (compare ortho (13) vs meta (12) vs para (11) fluorine derivatives and ortho (15)/para (14) methoxy) was preferred.

More polar residues such as nitro and methoxy were less active than hydrogen. In parallel, attempts to replace the exocyclic amine resulted in loss of activity. Likewise, conversion of the ketone to an oxime also resulted in inactive compounds. X-ray Crystallography. To accelerate optimization of the pyrazole lead series, significant effort was focused on generation of X-ray crystal structures of pyrazole analogues bound to p38R enzyme. The X-ray crystal structures of p38 MAP kinase with bound pyrazole compounds revealed a unique binding motif previously not reported for inhibitors of p38 kinase (Figure 1). This class of inhibitors form a hydrogen bond between the benzoyl oxygen and the main chain NH of methionine 109 (1.8 Å), a key interaction observed with all ATP competitive p38 inhibitors (Figure 1b). A novel hydrogen bond was observed between the NH2 group of the aminopyrazole and the side chain alcohol of threonine 106. A hydrogen bond between a p38 inhibitor and threonine 106 has not been reported previously. With only approximately 20% of the human kinome having a threonine at this position, we hypothesized that an inhibitor series with this unique interaction could confer improved selectivity versus other kinases which do not contain a similarly located threonine. The N-phenyl ring of this inhibitor class is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket toward the back of the binding site, which is partially defined by threonine 106. Lead Optimization Strategy. Compounds derived from the pyrazole series were extremely insoluble and had poor oral bioavailability. It was clear from the initial X-ray structures that substitution of the benzoyl ring at either the meta or para position would be well tolerated by the protein (Figure 1a). We anticipated that substitutions at this position would be required to achieve the desired physical properties for the series. Our basic strategy was to improve the potency of the lead compounds based on data from in in vitro assays and then to optimize the pharmacokinetic properties. We put particular emphasis on the LPS-induced cytokine production assay in undiluted human whole blood (HWB) as a key driver for compound selection as this assay provided surrogate efficacy in a physiologically

relevant environment in the presence of serum albumin and other proteins. Initial focus was to install either polar or ionizable functional groups to either the para or the meta position of the aryl ring either directly or via a linker group of different lengths. It became apparent after synthesis of a number of analogues that the meta position offered significantly greater tolerability to a wide range of substituents than the corresponding parasubstituted analogues (examples include meta-substituted compounds 31, 37 and 39 vs para analogues 32, 38 and 40). While it was not immediately evident from our X-ray structures why there was a preference for meta substitution, we focused our optimization on a broader range of substituents at the meta position. The installation of ionizable function, as expected, did lead to dramatic improvements in intrinsic solubility; an increase in solubility from 1 to 5 µg/mL in the lead molecule to >6 mg/mL and 5-10 mg/mL was obtained with analogues 25 and 36 respectively. This prompted us to explore other basic containing groups (Table 2). While these derivatives had desirable solubilities, they also exhibited greater inhibition in cellular assays than expected based on their intrinsic in vitro

enzyme potency. We postulated that these molecules may have other nonspecific effects resulting in cytotoxicy. In addition, compounds such as 21 suffered from problems such as poor metabolic stability and/or a complex metabolic profile specific to the amine-bearing side chains. We ultimately chose to look for alternate ways to improve the physicochemical properties including installation of less-basic amines which would be uncharged at physiologic pH. To this end, another series of pyridyl analogues were synthesized and the results are shown in Table 3. Within this series, several analogues were identified that had enhanced potency with a similar correlation between the isolated enzyme and the cellular assays as observed with the more basic amine derivatives. While these compounds showed good metabolic stability (only the N-oxide metabolite of the pyridyl ring was identified, data not shown), they unfortunately exhibited toxicity upon chronic administration in rodents. On the basis of these findings, alternate nonionizable solubilizing functional groups became the primary focus of the lead optimization strategy (Table 4). A variety of polar functional

derivatives were made including amides, sulfonamides, ethers, alcohols and diols. While several functionalities maintained excellent potency against p38, only a few derivatives retained both intrinsic potency as well as good inhibition of LPS-induced Il-1 production in undiluted human whole blood. The compounds which had the best balance between desirable physical properties and potency in both in vitro and acute in vivo assays were compounds 27 and 46 and diols 62 and 63. As there was no precedence for the use of diols as solubilizing groups for kinase inhibitors, there was some concern that these diols would be prone to rapid clearance in vivo. We chose to evaluate 27

and 46 and both enantiomers 62 and 63 in vivo to evaluate their pharmacokinetic properties. Definitive PK studies ultimately resulted in the selection of diol 63 (the (S) enantiomer) due to its high bioavailability and lower clearance rates relative to the (R) enantiomer and analogues 27 and 46 across multiple species Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of 63. A summary of the pharmacokinetic parameters for the S isomer 63 is detailed in Table 5. In animals, systemic clearance of 63 was low to moderate, while volume of distribution (Vdss) was medium to high. The absorption was rapid and complete. Oral bioavailability was 62%, 57% and 88% in rat, monkey and dog,

respectively. Compound 63 was moderately bound (79-88%) to plasma in all species studied. In vitro, 63 is a poor substrate for cytochrome P-450 and had a low affinity for the major isoforms. In Inhibition studies with human cytochrome P-450 enzymes, 63 modestly inhibited only the 2C9 isoform with an IC50 of 11 µM (IC50 values for human cytochromes 1A2, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 were greater than 25 µM). Pharmacological Evaluation of 63. The complete in vitro and in vivo pharmacology for diol 63 is summarized in Table 6. Compound 63 decreased the production of secreted cytokines such as TNFR in a human monocytic cell line, THP1, after stimulation with LPS. Compound 63 showed a concentrationdependent inhibition of TNFR production with an estimated IC50 of 0.25 µM. The inhibitory effect of 63 on TNFR and IL-1 production also was tested in a mononuclear cell fraction isolated from HWB. Inhibitor 63 displayed a similar concentrationdependent inhibition for both IL-1 and TNFR. The concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-1 was comparable to the

inhibition detected in the unfractionated whole blood, whereas TNFR was more potently inhibited in the mononuclear cell fraction. To evaluate 63 in vivo, the compound was tested in a number of acute inflammatory models. In the first study, 63 was dosed orally and was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the production of TNFR and IL-6 after IP injection of LPS into Hanover-Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats. In this model, 63 was administered to rats 0.5 h prior to challenge with 50 µg/kg LPS. Serum was collected 1.5 h after LPS injection for analysis of cytokines and concentrations of drug. Compound 63 demonstrated significant dose-dependent inhibition of serum TNFR and IL-6. The estimated effective dose (ED) for TNFR inhibition by 63 is reported in Table 6. In addition to inhibition of TNFR production, compound 63 also regulates TNFR signaling. In another rat model, 63 was administered to rats 0.5 h prior to challenge with TNFR. Serum was collected 2 h after IP injection of TNFR for analysis of cytokines and concentrations of drug. Compound 63 inhibited TNFR-induced IL-6 at an ED50 ( ASE of 1.5 ( 0.5 mg/kg. Furthermore, compound 63 was evaluated in a chronic disease model, rat adjuvant arthritis (AI), by subcutaneous delivery using osmotic minipumps. Lewis rats were treated with vehicle or compound 63 delivered at a rate of 0.5 mg/hr from day 1 to 14. Compound 63 inhibited the adjuvant-induced increase in hind paw weight by 58% (p < 0.01) compared to vehicle-treated animals. In addition, the mean clinical score exhibited by compound 63 treated rats was 6 (( 1) compared to 10 (( 0.7) out of a possible 19 in vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of compound 63 were 7.6 ( 0.8 and 7.5 ( 0.6 µM (mean ( SEM) on days 3 and 14, respectively. Kinase Selectivity Profiling. Protein kinases are considered "higher" risk drug discovery targets in part due to the difficulty to both measure and achieve kinase selectivity. We have continued to improve our ability to assess the kinase selectivity and to correlate the profiles of our kinase inhibitors with their in vitro and in vivo pharmacology. As part of these efforts, we evaluated the in vitro kinase selectivity profile of 63 against 105 kinases using the Ambit Biosciences platform.14 Of the 105 kinases tested, 63 inhibited only six other kinases with inhibition >50% at 10 µM concentration. For each of these kinases, the Kd was determined as is reported in Table 7. Compound 63 is highly selective for p38 and inhibits only two other kinases at comparable concentrations to its p38 activity. Compound 63 binds to both p38R and p38 isoforms but does not bind to either the p38  or p38  isoforms. Compound 63 binds to both

the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated form of p38R (data not shown) as commonly reported for ATP competitor inhibitors of p38. On the basis of all of these results, compound 63 was selected as a candidate for Phase I clinical trials as an oral agent that will suppress TNF and related cytokine production, with the potential to offer increased safety and efficacy compared to the current standard therapies for RA at appreciably less cost than that of biological anticytokine therapy. Conclusion A novel class of p38 inhibitors (5-amino-1-phenyl-1Hpyrazol-4-yl)phenylmethanones was identified by HTS. Initial SAR studies and the cocrystal structure of 25 with unphosphorylated p38 guided our efforts to improve both in vitro and in vivo potency as well as the physical properties of our initial lead. After surveying a wide variety of different solubilizing groups, only nonbasic solubilizing groups, particularly 2(S) glycerol monoether 63, resulted in a balance of good potency and favorable drug delivery characteristics with a desirable metabolic profile. To our knowledge, compound 63 represents the first use of a diol moiety as a solubilizing group for a kinase inhibitor selected for clinical study. Our data suggests that diols can be effectively used to improve the physical properties of otherwise insoluble kinase scaffolds. The use of the glycerol mono ether moiety on the pyrazole scaffold resulted in a molecule with excellent drug-like properties and high oral bioavailability while maintaining intrinsic potency against p38. Compound 63 selectively inhibits p38 MAP kinase, an enzyme in the intracellular signaling pathway for the generation of TNFR and IL-1 . The compound reduced the production of TNFR from human monocytes, whole blood, and a monocytic cell line in vitro as well as reduced the production of downstream cytokine IL-6 in vivo. Upon the basis of the range of efficacy in the biological models, compound 63 was selected as a clinical candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. Experimental Section

To a solution of 5-amino-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(3-iodobenzoyl)pyrazole (1.0 g, 2.46 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) were added potassium carbonate anhydrous (733 mg, 7.37 mmol), diboron pinacol ester (0.686 g, 2.70 mmol) and dichloro[1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium(II) dichloromethane adduct (0.20 g, 0.246 mmol). The solution was degassed with argon and warmed to 80 °C for 2 h. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature and dichloro[1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium(II) dichloromethane adduct (200 mg, 0.246 mmol) was added along with (2-bromoallyloxymethyl)benzene (0.613 g, 2.70 mmol) and sodium carbonate (1.3 g, 12.3 mmol) in water (6 mL). The reaction was again degassed and warmed back to 80 °C. After 18 h, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and was poured into water (100 mL), and the product was extracted into ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts were washed with brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. Concentration in vacuo gave a brown oil which was purified by flash column chromatography using 4:1-2:1 hexane/ethyl acetate to yield [5-amino-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1Hpyrazol-4-yl]-[3-(1-benzyloxymethylvinyl)phenyl]methanone (380 mg).

and then stirred with ether for 20 min, filtered and dried to give 0.785 g of [5-amino-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-(3-bromophenyl)methanone 60. [5-Amino-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]- (3-bromophenyl)methanone 60 (0.6 g, 1.48 mmol) was combined with piperidine (1.47 mL, 14.8 mmol) and ethanol (10 mL) and heated at reflux for 16 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was partitioned between a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated under vacuum and purified by column chromatography on silica gel using 16:1 CH2Cl2/MeOH. Dissolving the product in ethyl acetate then adding hydrochloric acid (1.0 M, 1.0 equivalent) formed the hydrochloric salt which was filtered and dried to give 0.413 g of [5-amino-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-[3-(2-piperidin1-yl-ethoxy)phenyl]methanone. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6)  1.39 (m, 1H), 1.66-1.98 (m, 5 H), 3.00 (m, 2H), 3.49 (m, 4H), 4.49 (t, J ) 4.92 Hz, 2H), 7.17-7.23 (m, 3H), 7.29 (m, 1 H), 7.38-7.51 (m, 4H), 7.57-7.62 (m, 2H), 7.81 (m, 1H).

To a solution of 5-amino-4-(3-hydroxybenzoyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)pyrazole (8.0 g, 26.9 mmol) in 30 mL dry dimethylformamide was added D-R, -isopropylideneglycerol -tosylate (11.3 g, 39.5 mmol) followed by anhydrous potassium carbonate (11.13 g, 80.7 mmol). The reaction was warmed to 80 °C under argon. After 24 h, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and diluted with distilled water (100 mL), and the product was extracted into ethyl acetate. The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and then concentrated in vacuo to a brown oil. The oil was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel using 2:1-1:1 hexanes/ethyl acetate as eluent. Concentration of the column fractions in vacuo gave 9.32 g of the desired acetal. To a solution of the acetal formed above (17.42 g, 42 mmol) in methanol (80 mL) were added distilled water (20 mL) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (500 mg). The solution was warmed to 50 °C under an argon atmosphere. After 6 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and concentrated in vacuo to a yellow oil. The oil was redissolved in ethyl acetate and 5% sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mL). The organic layer was separated, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo, and the desired diol precipitated out of solution to give 13 g of a white solid. The solid had a small amount of impurity and was thus suspended in 150 mL 1:1 hexanes/ethyl acetate and stirred for 1 h.

HTS Assay. HTS was performed using a Zymark robotic system and a 96-well, radioactive filtration binding format. The enzyme was preincubated with test compounds (40 µM) for 10 min. at 30 °C, following which the reaction was initiated by adding [33P] ATP (250 µM) and myelin basic protein (150 µM). Following an additional incubation for 20 min at 30 °C the reaction was terminated, and the radiolabeled product was captured on nitrocellulose filtration plate, washed and counted for radioactivity. Compounds which displayed >40% inhibition of the enzyme activity were retested at multiple concentrations. In Vitro Assay. Inhibition of human recombinant active p38R [5 nM] was tested by measuring the incorporation of 33P from -[33P] ATP [50 µM, 1 µCi] into myelin basic protein (MBP) (35 µM]. The assay was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate. In 40 µL reaction volume, 26 µL diluted p38R (5 nM) in assay dilution buffer (ADB) (20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, 40 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM -glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) were preincubated at room temperature for 10 min with 4 µL test compounds (0-100 µM), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (10%). The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 µL assay mix, containing ADB and -[33P] ATP (50 µM, 1 µCi) and MBP (35 µM). After 30 min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by transferring 25 µL reaction samples onto a prewetted phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore) containing 200 µL 0.75% phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The plate membranes were washed three times with 200 µL 0.75% H3PO4 for the removal of the free radionucleotide. 50 µL Microscint-20 scintillant (Packard) was added to each well; the plate was sealed with a plastic film and counted in a Packard Topcount microplate scintillation counter. The 50% inhibitory value was calculated by fitting the data to the equation: fractional activity ) 1/[I]/IC50 + 1 Induction of TNF Biosynthesis. THP1 cells were suspended in culture medium [RPMI (Gibco-BRL, Gailthersburg, MD) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.02 mM 2-mercaptoethanol], at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/mL and then plated in a 96well plate (0.2 mL aliquots in each well). Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted with the culture medium such that the final DMSO concentration was 5%. Twenty-five microliter aliquots of test solution or medium with DMSO (control) were added to each well. The cells were incubated for 30 min, at 37 °C. LPS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the wells at a final concentration of 0.5 µg/mL, and cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. At the end of the incubation period, culture supernatants were collected and the amount of TNF-R present was determined by a specific trapping ELISA assay using two antiTNF-R antibodies (2TNF-H22 and 2TNF-H34) as described.19 Inhibition of TNFR and IL-1 Biosynthesis in LPS-Stimulated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells. Blood was collected from healthy volunteers (drug-free for two weeks) into vacutainers (Becton Dickinson, Mountainview, CA) containing 19 units/mL sodium heparin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated using a Histopaque-1077 gradient (Sigma; H-8889). Briefly, whole blood was diluted 1:1 in Dulbecco's phosphatebuffered saline (Gibco; #14190-136) and layered onto the histopaque solution followed by centrifugation at 400g for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were collected and washed once in cold PBS followed by red cell lysis with lysing media (Sigma #R-7757, Lot #46H2373). A final cell suspension was prepared at 2 × 106 per mL in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL, #11875-085), 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 5.5 × 10-5 M -mercaptoethanol. Dilutions of test compounds were predispensed in 25 µL aliquots (before addition of cells) into round-bottom 96-well plates (U bottom TC

plate; Costar #3799). The starting concentration was 100 µM in 5% DMSO and 6 half log serial dilutions were made. After the addition of 200 µL cell suspension and 25 µL of 5 µg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli; 0127; B8; Cat. No. L3129, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in medium, the final DMSO concentration was 0.5%. Aliquots of test compounds were diluted an additional 10-fold, and the final LPS concentration was 500 ng/ mL. PBMC suspension (200 uL per sample) was preincubated with the diluted compound for 30 min at 37 °C followed by addition of 25 µL of LPS dissolved in RPMI (Gibco BRL, #11875-085) to produce a final LPS concentration of 0.5 µg/mL. Negative control wells received RPMI alone. Plates were incubated for 2 or 5 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for determination of TNFR or IL1 , respectively, followed by centrifugation at 150g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected from each sample and stored in polypropylene plates at 4 °C. TNF-R and IL-1 were determined by Elisa (Antibody Solutions, Palo Alto, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Optical density of each sample was read at 450 nm with a reference of 650 nm. Cytokine concentrations were determined from a standard curve using Molecular Devices SoftMax Pro. The percent inhibition was calculated for each concentration tested and an IC50 curve was constructed using Xlfit software. Systemic LPS and TNF-R Challenge. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Roche Palo Alto. Female Hanover-Wistar rats (100-130 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Hollister, CA). Animals were randomly segregated into groups (8 per group) and treated with LPS (Sigma, St Louis, MO; 50 µg/kg intraperitoneally in 0.9% saline) or TNF-R (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; 5 µg/kg intraperitoneally in 0.9% saline). Animals were treated with vehicle or compound 63 by oral gavage 30 min prior to LPS or TNF-R challenge. Animals were euthanized 90 min after the challenge by CO2 inhalation and serum harvested. TNF-R and IL-6 levels were measured in serum samples by ELISA (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rat Adjuvant Arthritis (AI). Female Lewis rats (120-150 g) from Charles River Laboratories were randomized and immunized with heat killed Mycobacterium butyricum (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) in light mineral oil (Sigma; 5 mg/ml) by intradermal injection (0.1 mL) into the tail on day 0. Vehicle (PEG 400) and compound 63 were subcutaneously delivered from day one onward by osmotic minipump (Alza; Mountain View, CA). Two minipumps were implanted to each rat and replaced on day eight. Plasma samples were collected on days three and fourteen. Animals were euthanized on day fourteen and hind paw weights recorded in addition to clinical scores. Rat Phamacokinetic Study. Female Wistar/Han (CRL:WI) Rats (Charles River, Hollister, CA) weighing between 180 and 220 g were used. Animals were allowed free access to a standard laboratory chow and tap water and were housed in a constant temperature-humidity environment. Three rats per dose regime were administered either single 10-mg/kg iv bolus doses (50% cyclodextran/water) or single 10-mg/kg oral suspension doses prepared in aqueous vehicle containing 0.9% NaCl, 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.4% polysorbate 80 and 0.9% benzyl alcohol. Blood was collected from each rat anesthetized with CO2:O2 (60: 40) via the orbital sinus or cardiac puncture at 1, 3, 6, 8 and 24 h after dosing. Plasma levels of test compounds were assayed by a LC/MS method. In this method, an aliquot of plasma was treated by mixing with acetonitrile to precipitate protein, centrifuged to clarify the supernatant and then further diluted with formate buffer (50 mM) and injected onto an HPLC. Test compounds were separated from endogenous interfering substances and subsequently eluted from the HPLC column for mass spectrometric quantification. Microsomal Incubations. Nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent transformation was studied with concentrations of 100 µM of test compound. Incubations were conducted at 37 °C and contained 2 mg/mL of liver microsomal protein in pH 7.4, 40 mM phosphate buffer containing 3 mM

magnesium chloride and 1.0 mM NADPH. Aliquots of the incubations were taken at specific time points over a 30 min incubation period. To stop the reaction the timed aliquots were added to an equal volume of acetonitrile containing an internal standard (IS). The IS-acetonitrile solution denatured and precipitated the microsomal protein. The protein was separated by centrifugation, and an aliquot of the resultant supernatants were assayed by a HPLC/UV method. Incubations prepared without the addition of NADPH acted as controls.
