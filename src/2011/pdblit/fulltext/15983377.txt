Inhalation anthrax is a deadly disease for which there is currently no effective treatment. Bacillus anthracis lethal factor (LF) metalloproteinase is an integral component of the tripartite anthrax lethal toxin that is essential for the onset and progression of anthrax. We report here on a fragment-based approach that allowed us to develop inhibitors of LF. The small-molecule inhibitors we have designed, synthesized, and tested are highly potent and selective against LF in both in vitro tests and cell-based assays. These inhibitors do not affect the prototype human metalloproteinases that are structurally similar to LF. Initial in vivo evaluation of postexposure efficacy of our inhibitors combined with antibiotic ciprofloxican against B. anthracis resulted in significant protection. Our data strongly indicate that the scaffold of inhibitors we have identified is the foundation for the development of novel, safe, and effective emergency therapy of postexposure inhalation anthrax.

that take advantage of highly sensitive heteronuclear NMR techniques, we have readily identified a preferred inhibitor scaffold for LF. Cell-based and peptide cleavage assays were subsequently used to confirm the potency of the iterated leads. Initial structural analyses of the LF­inhibitor complexes at the atomic resolution level provide insights on the rationale of the potency of the designed inhibitors. The inhibitory potency of the refined leads was validated in in vitro as well as cell-based assays. Preliminary in vivo studies on the efficacy of our inhibitors combined with antibiotic ciprofloxican against B. anthracis (Sterne strain) are also discussed. Materials and Methods
Reference Compounds and Reagents. All common chemicals, re-

agents, and buffers were purchased from Sigma­Aldrich, Chembridge (San Diego), or Maybridge (Cornwall, U.K.). Recombinant LF and MAPKKide were both purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Fluorinated peptide substrate was from Anaspec (San Jose, CA).
Fluorescence Peptide Cleavage Assay. Cleavage reactions (100 l each) were performed in a 96-well plate. Each reaction contained MAPKKide (4 M) and LF (50 nM) in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and the small-molecule inhibitor. Kinetics of the peptide cleavage was examined for 30 min by using a fluorescent plate reader at excitation and emission wavelength at 485 and 590 nm, respectively. The Km and Vmax values of the MAPKKide cleavage by LF were determined at 25°C by using the same experimental condition described above for the fluorescence screening assay but with increasing MAPKKide concentrations (2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 M). The Ki and Km(app) were calculated at a fixed 10 M inhibitor concentration. All constant values were definitely evaluated by fitting the data to the Lineweaver­Burk plot.
19F NMR 1D spectra were acquired on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) Avance 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a selective 19F 1H probe. Each spectrum was recorded at 25°C in buffers with a 9:1 H2O:D2O ratio. All spectra were collected with a sweep width of 5 ppm and an acquisition time of 20 min. The LF assay was performed with 50 nM recombinant LF (List Biological Laboratories) and 20 M peptide substrate Ac-A-R-R-K-K-V-YP-NH-Ph-CF3 (Anaspec); inhibition activity was detected in the same conditions. Reaction was quenched after 30 min by using 100 M GM6001 (List Biological Laboratories) at 0°C or BI-MFM3.

he U.S. government has declared that an effective postexposure treatment of anthrax is a key national priority in the fight against bioterrorism. Bacillus anthracis (1) is the causative bacterium of anthrax, and its clinical presentation and outcome strongly depend on its entry route in humans. Cutaneous anthrax is rarely lethal. In contrast, inhalation anthrax, a potential weapon of bioterror, is far more dangerous and usually fatal if it is not diagnosed and treated early (2). After anthrax spores are inhaled, they adhere to alveolar macrophages and then germinate. Bacteria migrate to lymph nodes, where they rapidly multiply (3) and excrete a tripartite exotoxin comprised of protective antigen (PA, 83 kDa), lethal factor (LF) Zn2 - metalloproteinase (90 kDa), and calmodulin-activated edema factor adenylate cyclase (EF, 89 kDa). Current knowledge suggests that the concerted activity of PA, LF, and EF kills host macrophages and largely eliminates the host immune system, thereby promoting continual progression of the disease. Unless properly and promptly treated, inhalation anthrax will lead to the death of the host organism (4). To exert its lethal effect, anthrax lethal toxin must enter inside the cell compartment. PA binds to the ubiquitously expressed cellular receptors (5) and, after its proteolytic activation by the furin-like proprotein convertases and the release of the N-terminal 20-kDa fragment, generates the mature PA protein (PA63). PA63 heptamerizes and binds both LF and EF. After endocytosis of the resulting complexes, the engulfed molecules of LF and EF are liberated and exert their toxic action (6). Inside the cell compartment, LF cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKK) (7­9), disrupts signal transduction, and finally leads to macrophage lysis through a mechanism that is not completely understood to date (10). Accordingly, inhibition of LF is the most promising means for treating postexposure anthrax (11, 12). We describe in this report a fragment-based drug design approach that led us to the discovery of several small-molecule synthetic inhibitors, which have shown a strong and highly specific inhibition of LF protease activity.

Synthetic Chemistry. General procedure for the synthesis of rhodamine derivatives (Table 2). Rhodanine acetic acid (0.100 g, 0.523 mmol) was

added to a solution of the furfuraldehyde (0.575 mmol) in dimethylformamide (1 ml), and the mixture was stirred until it became homogenous. The mixture was then placed in the microwave (Milestone, Monroe, CT), where it underwent four cycles of 1-min heating (140°C, 1,000 W) and 3 min of cooling (25°C). Water was then added to the solution, where precipitate was formed. The precipitate was collected via filtration, recrystallized from acetone water, and dried to yield the desired compound. Characterization of each compound was obtained by means of NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, as reported below.

Novagen, San Diego, CA). The recombinant N-terminally Histagged MAPKK1 construct was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The expression of the His-MAPKK1 chimera was induced by isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside. The soluble His-MAPKK1 protein was purified from the cell lysate on a HiTrap Chelating High Performance Ni-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences). His-MAPKK1 was eluted from the column with a linear 0­300 mM imidazole gradient. The high purity of the isolated His-MAPKK1 was confirmed by SDS PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses.
LF Proteolysis of MAPKK1. His-MAPKK1 (700 ng) was coincubated at 30°C for 2 h with LF (10 ng) in 20 l of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. The digest reactions were stopped by adding 4 l of 5% SDS. The digest samples were analyzed on SDS PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel. Where indicated, increasing concentrations of LF inhibitors (0.1­20 M) were added to the samples to inhibit the LF proteolysis of MAPKK1. Cytotoxicity Assay.

was a kind gift of M. Fukuda (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). The cells were grown to confluence in wells of a 48-well plate (Costar) in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma). The cells were replenished with fresh medium (0.1 ml per well) and then incubated with LF inhibitors for 4 h to allow the inhibitors to penetrate the cell compartment. PA and LF were then added to the final concentration of 500 ng ml and 25 ng ml, respectively. After incubation for an additional 4 h, cell viability was assessed by 3,[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining. Cells were incubated with 0.5 mg ml MTT in DMEM for 45 min at 37°C; the medium was aspirated, and the blue pigment produced by the viable cells was solubilized with 0.5% SDS 25 mM HCl in 90% isopropyl alcohol. The concentration of oxidized MTT in the samples was measured at 570 nm by using a microplate reader. Each datum point represents the results of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. A percentage of viable cells was calculated by using the following equation: (A570 of cells treated with LF, PA and inhibitor) A570 of cells treated with LF and PA .

by using a concentration of 13 mg ml LF. Crystals were grown from 1.70 M (NH4)2SO4 0.2 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0­7.5 2 mM EDTA by using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, as described in ref. 30. Monoclinic crystals appeared after 4 days to 2 weeks and were then harvested for experiments. The LF crystals are of the space group monoclinic P21, with averaged unit cell dimensions a 96.70 Å, b 137.40 Å, c 98.30 Å, 90, 98, and 90, containing two molecules per asymmetrical unit. The soaked crystals for this crystal complex had unit cell dimensions a 95.96 Å, b 136.65 Å, c 97.90 Å, 90, 98.23, and 90. LF native crystals were harvested from the hanging drops in which they were grown and bathed in several rounds of fresh buffer without EDTA, consisting of 1.90 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0, and finally left to soak in this solution for an additional 30 min. These crystals were then used for obtaining the protein­ inhibitor­zinc complexes. All manipulations were done at room temperature (23­26°C). The LF-BI-MFM3-Zn protein­inhibitor crystal complex was obtained by soaking an individual native LF monoclinic P21 crystal in a solution of 1 mM Zn SO4 1.90 M (NH4)2SO4 0.2 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0, for 10 min, then transferring the crystal to a solution of 1.0 mM MFM3 inhibitor, 1%(vol vol) DMSO 1.9M (NH4)2SO4 0.2

Finally, the crystal was transferred into a cryoprotectant solution of 1.0 mM MFM3 inhibitor 2.4 M (NH4)2SO4 0.2 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0 2 mM EDTA 25% glycerol and soaked at room temperature for an additional 1 min. The crystal was then immediately mounted onto a cryoloop and flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen. All data collection was done at 100 K. The dataset for the LF complexes was collected in the Burnham Institute's in-house x-ray facility on a Rigaku (Tokyo) FR-E rotating copper anode generated x-ray beam (wavelength 1.5418 Å). X-ray diffraction data were collected for LF-BI-MFM3-Zn2 to resolution limits of 2.67 Å. Using PDB ID 1J7N as the starting model (without water molecules), the model of LF (with Zn2 ions in the catalytic site) alone was put through rigid body refinement and then minimization, before the first initial maps were calculated for model building and further refinement. Excess electron density at level 1.0 indicated the binding location of the inhibitor in the active site of LF. The model of the inhibitor was then built into this position and further refined in CNS (31). The final R factors 27.6% and Rwork 23.4% for LF-BI-MFM3-Zn. were Rfree The current models fall within the limits of all of the quality criteria of the program PROCHECK (www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk roman procheck procheck.html) from the CCP4 (www.ccp4. ac.uk main.html) suite.

DMSO. The animals were challenged on day 0 with 2 107 spores per mouse in PBS through i.p. injection. Treatment was started 24 h after challenge. Treatment regimes include ciprofloxacin alone (50 mg kg) or a combination of ciprofloxacin with B1-11B1, B1-11B2, or B1-11B3 LF inhibitors (5 mg kg). Animals were closely monitored twice per day until day 14 after infection. Animals were divided into five groups based on their treatment:

Control (not treated). Ciprofloxacin alone. Ciprofloxacin B1-11B1. Ciprofloxacin B1-11B2. Ciprofloxacin B1-11B3.

Ciprofloxacin and LF blocking substances were administered through i.p. injection with a volume of 200 l for each once per day for 10 days. All surviving animals were killed on day 14 by CO2 inhalation. Sick animals that appeared moribund (exhibiting a severely reduced or absent activity or locomotion level, an unresponsiveness to external stimuli, or an inability to obtain readily available food or water, along with any of the following accompanying signs: ruffled haircoat, hunched posture, inability to maintain normal body temperature, signs of hypothermia, respiratory distress, or any other severely debilitating condition) were killed on the same day. Results Peptide cleavage fluorescence assays are straightforward when screening for potent LF inhibitors. Keeping in mind that LF specifically cleaves proteins of the MAPKK family (13) at their N termini (14), we used the optimized peptide MAPKKide as a substrate for our fluorescence assay (List Biological Laboratories). Particularly, MAPKKide is derived from the MAPKK-2 substrate

K.A. Three compounds, BI-11B1, BI-11B2, and BI-11B3, were prepared in two steps. One week before the start of the study, 200 mg of each compound was dissolved in 800 l of DMSO and stored at 20°C. Immediately before injection, each substance was diluted in PBS, resulting in a final concentration of 0.5 mg ml in 2%

for LF, and it is intramolecularly quenched by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The C-terminally linked fluorophore is a FITC, and the acceptor chromophore is 4-([4 -(dimethylamino)phenyl]azo) benzoic acid (DABCYL). After cleavage by LF, it is possible to detect a sensible fluorescence increase in the reaction solution setting excitation and emission wavelengths at 485 and 590 nm, respectively. Although it would be a sensible strategy to use such an assay to screen several thousand compounds, herein we report a different approach, based on the initial identification of preferred weakly binding scaffolds to be successively used as a starting point for iterative optimizations (15). Although the fluorescence-based assay is a robust technique to search for very potent inhibitors, it becomes more ambiguous in detecting weaker ligands ( 100 M), possibly due to interference introduced by test compounds (normally used at high concentration) in the spectrophotometric assay. For this reason, we relied on a NMR-based enzymatic assay, which is unlikely to lead to false positives (16­23). Recently, the use of 19F-1D NMR to detect enzyme activity and inhibition both in proteases and kinases has been reported (22). NMR experiments based on observation of 19F present several benefits. Above all, this nucleus shows sensitivity comparable to that of 1H, so that it is possible to acquire 1D spectra in a relatively short time. Moreover, because of its large anisotropy, 19F chemical shifts are spread over a wide spectral window; as a consequence, the potential spectral resolution is greatly improved. It is also worth underlining that overlapped signals arising from buffers, solvents, and other reaction components are unlikely to occur in 19F-NMR spectra. We succeeded in detecting LF inhibition by 19F-NMR using the fluorinated peptide Ac-A-R-R-K-K-V-Y-P-NH-Ph-CF3 as an enzymatic substrate (24, 25). Cleavage of the peptide occurring at the Pro-Xxx position deeply affects chemical environment of 19F nuclei because of the conversion of the amide functionality into an amine with release of pCF3-aniline. Therefore, it is possible to monitor LF kinetics and inhibition by monitoring 19F NMR signals of uncleaved peptide substrate and the reaction product pCF3-aniline. We applied such a strategy to a small but diversified library of 300 compounds representing most of the scaffolds commonly found in drugs (26). This library was designed by selecting compounds on the basis of their drug-like properties, ease of synthesis, and or availability of several hundred derivatives. Therefore, a library of only 300 scaffolds representative of a chemical space of several hundreds of thousands compounds was tested. Application of this strategy led to the identification of compound BI-9B9b (Table 1), which exerted 50% LF inhibition at 140 M concentration. Exploring commercially available chemical repositories, such as Maybridge, Chembridge, and those listed by Chemnavigator (San Diego), we spotted the most representative derivatives of BI-9B9b (22 among 680 analogues identified by using a 2D substructure search). These compounds were selected on the basis of an additional experiment in which we could not detect any appreciable LF inhibition (up to 500 M) when the furan ring was substituted by a benzene ring, indicating that both rings of BI-9B9b are important for binding. All selected compounds (Table 1) have been tested by both NMR- and traditional fluorescence-based assays. Compounds BI-MFM3 and 17­21 emerged as very effective inhibitors with a 70% LF inhibition at 10 M concentration. For each compound, the 19F-1D NMR assay was performed. The results of a representative assay are shown in Fig. 1. The cleavage of the fluorinated peptide (20 M) by LF (50 nM) led to a strong NMR signal of pCF3-aniline (Fig. 1a). A known hydroxamate inhibitor of LF, GM6001 (27), at a concentration of 20 M, demonstrated a 50% inhibition of the LF activity (Fig. 1b). In turn, BI-MFM3 (20 M) fully inhibited the cleavage of the fluorinated peptide by LF, thus pointing to BI-MFM3 as a more potent inhibitor against LF when compared with GM6001 (Fig. 1c). Subsequently, the IC50 value of the inhibitors was determined in the MAPKKide peptide cleavage assays (Table 1). The IC50 of the

most potent inhibitor, BI-MFM3, was 1.7 M (Fig. 1e). To confirm and extend these findings, we measured the Ki value and the type of inhibition of LF by BI-MFM3 (Fig. 1f ). For these purposes, we initially determined the Km and Vmax of the MAPKKide cleavage 0.0007 mol by LF, which were 2.22 0.2 M and 0.0942 min 1 mg 1, respectively. We then used a 10 M concentration of BI-MFM3 to identify the inhibitor's Ki value, which was determined to be 0.8 0.3 M in our assay. Because BI-MFM3 affected the Km rather than the Vmax of the cleavage reactions, BI-MFM3 is considered to be a competitive inhibitor of LF. To assess the specificity of our compounds against other MMPs, we tested them against two more related MMPs: MMP2 and MMP9, which appear to be the most functionally important human MMPs (28). Although the IC50 of the initial scaffold BI-9B9b against MMP-2 and MMP-9 was 10 M, BI-MFM3 did not inhibit these proteases at concentrations up to 100 M. To evaluate the activity of BI-MFM3, 19, and 21 in cell-based tests, we used murine RAW264.7 cells, which are sensitive to LF and undergo apoptosis if treated with the bipartite PA-LF toxin. Compounds 19, 21, and especially BI-MFM3 were capable significantly of rescuing cells from the toxic action of LF at micromolar concentration (not shown). These observations have suggested that these three identified leads provide a solid foundation for the design of more effective drugs with improved efficiency against LF. Encouraged by these data, we sought to design additional compounds with improved inhibitory properties on the basis of structure­activity relationship data reported in Table 1, as follows. The presence in R1 position of a substituted phenyl with a small electronegative group significantly increases the inhibitory activity, whereas a small group containing a carboxylic moiety in position R2 also seems to improve the potency. On the contrary,
Forino et al.

a large group, such as a substituted phenyl in R2, causes a dramatic reduction of activity, especially if not balanced with an effective group in R1. In particular, a comparison of activities for compounds 8 and 17 suggested that an acetyl group would be the preferred substituent in R2. Regarding R1 group, substitutions in all positions on the phenyl ring seem to be equally effective, thus indicating that compounds with multiple substitutions may result in increased activity. To verify these hypotheses, we elaborated a synthetic scheme (Fig. 1g) to afford additional BI-MFM3 analogues (Table

2). In agreement with the above observations, each of the synthesized compounds showed an increased inhibitory activity compared with BI-MFM3 in both the fluorescence and NMR-based assays. Particularly, compound BI-11B3 appeared to be the most potent inhibitor, with a Ki value of 32 22 nM (Fig. 1f ). A NMR-based assay using the fluorinated peptide also confirmed the potency of BI-11B3 in inhibiting LF (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, to rule out the possibility of eventual nonspecific interactions, we verified that no substantial changes in the IC50 values for compounds BI-11B1 and BI-11B3 were detected when increasing 7-fold the protein concentration (from 25 to 175 nM), as well as by preincubating the

BI-11B2 and GM6001 (as control) were each coincubated with LF and MAPKK1. The digest samples were analyzed by SDS PAGE to determine the specific conversion of MAPKK1 into the 45-kDa cleavage product. (b) Inhibitors BI-11B2 and BI-11B3 are effective in protecting MAPKK1 and murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells against LF. Cells were coincubated with anthrax PA (500 ng ml) and LF (40 ng ml). The indicated concentrations of the inhibitors were added to the cells. In 4 h, the residual viable cells were measured by adding the tetrazolium salt 3,[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The data show that inhibitors BI-11B2 (open circles) and BI-11B3 (filled circles) protect cells from the cytotoxic effect by LF and PA.

Fig. 4. Comparison of survival rates between different treatments regimes. DBA2 mice were infected with B. anthracis Sterne spores at a dosage of 2 107 per mouse in 200 l of PBS on day 0 through i.p. injection. Animals were treated with ciprofloxacin alone or in combination with lethal toxin blocking substance B1-11B3. Similar data were obtained with compound BI-11B1 (not shown). Treatment was started 24 h postexposure and continued for 10 days. Nontreated mice were used as a control. Animals were monitored for 14 days after infection.

compounds with LF for 30 min. These simple tests have been shown to give dramatically different IC50 values in the presence of nonspecific ligand­protein interactions (29). To corroborate these findings, we also tested the efficiency of BI-11B1, BI-11B2, and BI-11B3 in protecting MAPKK1, a natural protein target of LF, from the LF proteolysis in vitro. In the concentration range of 1­2 M, each of the three inhibitors was capable of protecting MAPKK1 from LF cleavage, and each of the inhibitors was superior relative to the GM6001 hydroxamate (Fig. 2a). BI-11B1 and especially BI-11B2 and BI-11B3 were highly potent in protecting the RAW264.7 cells against LF-induced cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 2­5 M (Fig. 2b), compared with 50 M observed with GM6001. Thus, BI-11B2 and BI-11B3 were at least 1 order of magnitude more potent in cell-based assays than the GM6001 hydroxamate. In these assays, we could not observe 100% protection with our compounds, probably due to reduced solubility at higher concentrations and or limited macrophage cell membrane permeability. However, after initial infection, it is reasonable to assume that even a 60% (as shown) or lower rescuing of macrophage activity could be sufficient to combat bacterial proliferation. To obtain further insights on the mechanism of action of our compounds, we have also initiated a structural characterization of the most potent compounds by means of x-ray crystallography (Fig. 3). We are currently trying to obtain x-ray high-resolution structures for LF in complex with compounds BI-MFM3 as well as BI-11B1 and BI-11B3. Details of the 3D structure of the complex between LF and BI-MFM3 are reported in Fig. 3. Analysis of the docked structure revealed that the rhodanine ring is capable of interacting with Zn2 metal-ion via the thiazolidine sulfur atom, which explained the activity of the scaffold BI-9B9b (Table 1) against LF and other MMPs (Fig. 3). The carboxylic group of BI-MFM3 is pointing toward a hydrophilic region of the protein close to its surface, which explains the variability of the substitutions allowed at this position and the increased affinity of the compounds when R2 is a small charged group (Table 1). In addition, hydrophobic interactions between the phenyl ring group and hydrophobic side chains of LF were also observed, and most likely they are responsible for the increased affinity and selectivity of our compounds for LF vs. other MMPs and the increased affinity with bisubstituted compounds (Table 2). The electron density of the benzene ring is less evident in the structure of BI-MFM3, indicating a possible conformational mobility. To evaluate the efficacy of LF inhibitors when combined with antibiotic against postexposure to Bacillus anthracis (Sterne strain), we tested the effect of our compounds in female DBA2 mice (9­11 weeks old) with body weights between 20 and 24 grams (Taconic Laboratories, Germantown, NY). The animals were challenged on

day 0 with 2 107 spores per mouse in PBS through i.p. injection. Treatment, started 24 h after challenge, included ciprofloxacin alone (50 mg kg) or a combination of ciprofloxacin with LF inhibitors B1-11B1, B1-11B2, or B1-11B3 (5 mg kg). Animals were closely monitored twice per day until day 14 after infection. Survival rates of mice treated with B1-11B3 in combination with ciprofloxacin compared with the survival rates of mice treated only with ciprofloxacin are shown in Fig. 4. LF inhibitor B1-11B1 in combination with ciprofloxican provided 40% protection against the B. anthracis Sterne infection compared with the conventional treatment ciprofloxacin that protected only 20% of the animals. Discussion Despite the current threat of bioterrorism, there is no specific and effective therapy for inhalation anthrax, a deadly disease in humans. The proteolytic activity of LF MMPs is essential for the onset, progression, and lethality of anthrax. We have applied a fragmentbased methodology that has led us to the identification of an initial LF inhibitory scaffold. The iterative optimizations of this scaffold have resulted in a series of phenylfuran-2-ylmethylenerhodanineacetic acid derivatives with a nanomolar inhibitory activity against LF. During the past two decades, major efforts from both the academic and pharmaceutical industry sectors have been devoted to the identification of metal­protease inhibitors, given their pivotal role in virtually any human disease (32). A common approach to the development of such inhibitors relied on structure-guided derivatizations of Zn2 chelating compounds, most commonly hydroxamate, to yield potent and possibly selective compounds (33). Likewise, the scaffolds reported here could well be used to derive additional potent and selective inhibitors of several other Zn-metallo-proteases, also aided by our structural analysis and structure­ activity relationship data. The LF inhibitors we have derived are capable of protecting macrophages from LF-induced cytotoxicity at concentrations well below those needed with a nonselective hydroxamate-based protease inhibitor and show synergistic protection with ciprofloxacin in vivo. Although further in-depth pharmacokinetics studies will be necessary to establish the exact dosage and regimen of the compound and to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed combination therapy against inhalation anthrax, the data reported here provide in vivo evidence of the effectiveness of LF inhibitors in the treatment of postexposure anthrax. As such, our lead compounds hold great promise for the development of novel, safe, and effective emergency therapy of postexposure inhalation anthrax.
