Abstract N-(5-Bromo-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)butanamide (compound 1) was found active (IC50 = 808 nM) in a high throughput screening (HTS) for CDK2 inhibitors. By exploiting crystal structures of several complexes between CDK2 and inhibitors and applying structure-based drug design (SBDD), we rapidly discovered a very potent and selective CDK2 inhibitor 4-[(5-isopropyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)amino] benzenesulfonamide (compound 4, IC50 = 20 nM). The syntheses, structure-based analog design, kinases inhibition data and X-ray crystallographic structures of CDK2/inhibitor complexes are reported. # 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is one of the cyclindependent Ser/Thr kinases and plays an essential role in the cell cycle [1,2]. To date, 13 distinct CDKs and 25 different cyclinbox containing proteins have been identified from human genome sequencing [3]. Different CDK/cyclin combinations serve to regulate distinct check points in the cell division cycle. CDK2 activity is required for progression through G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle [1,2]. A large number of CDK2 crystal structures, including the apoform and binary as well as ternary complexes, are available from the public domain. Molecules complexed with CDK2 include the co-factor ATP, various ATP-competitive inhibitors, Cyclin A and Cyclin M, p27, KAP as well as combinations thereof [4,5]. N-(5-Bromo-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)butanamide (IC50 CDK2/ Cyclin A = 808 nM, compound 1 of Fig. 1) emerged as an active compound from a HTS screening for CDK2 inhibition. In this article, we report the syntheses, activities and crystal structures of derivatives of 1 in complex with CDK2 and we show how, following a structure-based approach, we rapidly

identified more potent and selective ATP-competitive CDK2/ Cyclin A/E inhibitors, i.e. 2 (IC50 = 192 nM) and 4 (IC50 = 20 nM) of Fig. 1. The potency of the thiazole class was thus improved by synthesizing, in the early phase of the drug discovery program, only few analogs. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Inhibitors docking The docking program QXP [6] was used to dock the designed molecules in a crystal structure of CDK2/CyclinA (PDB code 1JST). QXP was employed using the docking algorithm, referred to as MCdock [7]. This algorithm allows for fully flexibility of the inhibitor and simultaneous flexibility of selected active site side-chains, which can move under the influence of the molecular mechanics force field during energy minimization. The sections designated for movement can be made fully flexible or partially flexible (using distance-based constraints). The CDK2 glycine-rich loop region (Gly11, Glu12, Gly16 and Val17) and Glu8 was treated as partially flexible, Lys33, Lys89, Tyr15 and Gln85 as completely flexible. The docking run included 1000 steps of Monte Carlo perturbation and final energy minimization. The results were

solution (at a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml) and reservoir solution (10% PEG3350, 50 mM ammonium acetate, 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.4). Compounds 3 and 4 of Fig. 1 were dissolved separately in DMSO at a concentration of 50 mM. The inhibitor stock solutions were then added to the crystals' mother liquor up to a final DMSO concentration of about 15%. Crystals were soaked for up to one week and then transferred to a cryoprotectant solution (10% PEG3350, 50 mM ammonium acetate, 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.4, 25% glycerol). Diffraction data were collected at the X-ray beamline 5.2R of the Elettra synchrotron, Trieste, Italy, using a 345 mm MAR imaging plate detector. X-ray data were processed with the DENZO/HKL [10] package and reduced with the CCP4 suite [11]. The structures were solved by difference Fourier and refined with the program REFMAC [12]. Cycles of refinement were alternated with manual rebuilding of the protein and inhibitors using the graphics program O [13]. A summary of the diffraction data and the refinement statistics are shown in Table 1.

Compounds 1­5 were prepared as depicted in Schemes 1­3. 2-Amino-5-isopropyl-1,3-thiazole 8b was prepared by reacting 3-methyl-butanaldehyde with bromine, followed by thiourea [14] in 42% yield over the two steps (Scheme 1). Acylation of 8b and of the commercially available 2-amino-5-bromo-1,3thiazole 8a led to compounds 1­3 [14]. The reductive amination of 8b (Scheme 2) with benzaldehyde, Me4NBH(OAc)3 and acetic acid in 1,2-dichloroethane provided compound 5 [15]. Compound 4 was synthesized according to Scheme 3. The 2bromo-aldehyde 7 was reacted with 4-aminosulfonyl-phenyl thiourea, which can be easily obtained from the corresponding aniline [16]. Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel (E. Merck, Grade 60, 230­400 mesh) with the eluent indicated. Melting points are uncorrected. Proton NMR spectra were recorded with Bruker (300 MHz). Less common abbreviations

Results and discussion Compound 1 of Fig. 1 was a commercial compound present in our research compound collection. Its ATP-competitive binding to CDK2 was confirmed by kinetic analysis of

biochemical assay data. Several crystal structures of CDK2 have been reported in literature. These include CDK2 or CDK2/ Cyclin A in complex with ATP [17], isopentenyladenine [18,19], olomucine [20], roscovitine [18], staurosporine [21], des-chloro-flavopiridol [22], purvalanol B [23], indirubin [24] O6-cyclohexylmethylguanines [25], 2-anilino-4-(thiazol5yl)pyrimidine [26] as well as CDK2/Cyclin A with and without ATP [27,28] and pseudo-peptitic substrate bound [24]. The association of CDK2 with Cyclin A results in modification of the ATP-binding site. Thus, in the present modelling studies, the fully activated CDK2 structure in complex with Cyclin A available from the Protein Data Bank [29] was used (1JST PDB code). Compound 1 was docked into the ATP-binding site of CDK2 with the thiazole ring occupying part of the region of the purine ring of ATP. The model was subsequently energy minimized, allowing flexibility to the protein. The relative binding modes of compound 1 and ATP are shown in Fig. 2. The planar aromatic thiazole ring is sandwiched between two large planar hydrophobic surfaces formed by a pool of lipophilic residues: Val18, Ala31, Val64, Leu134, Ala144 (for simplicity not shown in Fig. 2). The main chain atoms from residues Glu81 to Leu83 are involved in the hydrogen-bonding network of both the ATP and the inhibitor. The nitrogen atom of the thiazole ring can accept a hydrogen bond from the amide nitrogen of Leu83 and the amide-NH is able to donate a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Leu83. The bromine atom extends into a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by the side-chains of Phe80, Val18, Val64 and Ala144. Recently, crystal structures of CDK2 in complex with different aminothiazoles were also published [30­33]. In these crystal structures, the thiazole ring-binding mode is the same as that of our compounds. The comparative analysis of the docking model of compound 1 with the crystal structure of CDK2 in complex with roscovitine [18] (Fig. 3a­c) prompted us to introduce a (hetero)aromatic benzyl moiety in the amidic side-chain and to

further elaborate the hydrophobic substitution in 5. To this end, a new 2-benzylcarbonylamino 4-isopropyl thiazole derivative was designed: compound 2 of Fig. 1. Modelling experiments supported the possibility of changing the bromine atom into a bigger hydrophobic isopropyl group, as present in the roscovitine molecule (see Fig. 3a­c). The 2-benzyl carbonyl amino moiety in position 2 of the thiazole in compound 2 perfectly mimics the interaction with the protein of the N6-benzyl group present in the purine CDK2 inhibitors, such as roscovitine (Fig. 3) and olomucine. This group was proposed to be an important determinant for specificity in the purine class of CDK inhibitors [18,19]. In fact, roscovitine and olomucine inhibit CDK1, CDK2 and CDK5 while are inactive against CDK4 and CDK6 [20]. One of the two residues contacting the N6-benzyl moiety (Phe82 of CDK2) is different between these two sub-families: phenylalanine in CDK1/CDK2/CDK5 and histidine in CDK4/CDK6 kinases (see Table 2). Compound 2 showed to be more active than the starting hit (compound 1) with an IC50 = 192 nM and was selective against CDK4/Cyclin D1 (IC50 CDK4/Cyclin D1 > 10 mM). Other hydrophobic 5- or 6-member rings can replace the phenyl ring of compound 2 with essentially conserved

inhibitory efficacy (data not shown). In particular, the replacement of the phenyl ring with a meta-pyridine aromatic ring gave compound 3 (Fig. 1) showing an IC50 of 95 nM. To elucidate the details of the interaction between compound 3 and CDK2, the crystal structure of the protein­inhibitor complex ° was determined and refined to 1.9 A resolution (crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1). The CDK2 protein, common with other protein kinases, comprises an aminoterminal lobe that is almost entirely b-sheet and a mostly a-helical C-terminal lobe. Compound 3 binds into the ATPbinding cleft, locating in between the two lobes, with its thiazole ring occupying part of the region of the purine ring of ATP, as described above for the binding model of compound 1. The pyridine ring is well ordered and makes hydrophobic interactions with residues Ile10 and Phe82. From the calculated electron density map, it is not obvious which of the two possible positions the pyridine nitrogen atom occupies. However, in one of the two orientations a water-mediated hydrogen bond can be formed with the side-chain of Lys20 (see Fig. 4). This bridging water molecule is very well located and has been observed to be often present in other in-house CDK2 crystal structures. The presence of this additional hydrogen bond leads to an

improvement in CDK2 inhibitory activity. Compound 3, as compound 2, displays selectivity against CDK4/Cyclin D1 (see Table 3). Examination of the initial docked ligands and the subsequent crystal structure of compound 3 with CDK2 provided insight for the design of a more potent analogue. To pick up potential additional interactions with Asp86, we envisaged substitution of the n-propyl amide moiety in a para sulfonamide aniline substituent (compound 4 of Fig. 1, IC50 = 20 nM). The structural modification implemented in this compound (with respect to the modification in compounds 2 and 3) provides a more rigid compound with an associated favourable entropic contribution to binding affinity. The aniline group packs closely towards the side-chain of the hydrophobic residues Ile10. The key interactions of the sulfonamide moiety with both the main and the side-chain atoms of Asp86 were confirmed by the crystal structure of CDK2 in complex with ° compound 4 refined at 2.0 A resolution (Table 1). A weak

hydrogen-bond interaction with Lys89, which is solvent exposed and highly flexible (Fig. 5), is also formed. The Lys89 hydrogen-bond interaction might be important in imparting selectivity to this inhibitor against CDK4/Cyclin D1 (see Table 3) [34]. In fact, the corresponding residue in CDK4 is a threonine (see Table 2). The combination of the two modifications, the isopropyl in position 5 and the para sulfonamide aniline in position 2, resulted in an increase of activity by two orders of magnitude for compound 4 with respect to the original hit, compound 1. It was lately confirmed and reported by others that the para sulfonamide aniline substituent brings about an improvement of both potency and selectivity. This effect was reported in the oxindole-based inhibitors [35,36] (see 1FVT and 1KE5 PDB codes) and in the purine-based inhibitors [37­39] (see 1H1S, 1JSV and 1OIT PDB codes). Several other modes of expansion were not pursued based on structural inspection coupled with single molecule experimental proof. As an example, we have explored the effect of a 3-N-benzylamino group in the 2-amino thiazole scaffold. Compound 5 of Fig. 1 was synthesized and no CDK2 inhibition was detected (% inhibition @ 10 mM = 8%). A conformational analysis was carried out on compound 5 by rotating the two torsion angles of the benzyl group while maintaining fixed the thiazole core. Fig. 6 reports three representative conformational minima of compound 5. Conformations A and B cannot fit into CDK2 pocket due to severe steric interactions with Ile10, Asp86; conformation C has a poor binding affinity as the benzyl group is not making any direct contact with the protein.

4. Conclusion In summary, compound 1 was identified by HTS screening of our research compound collection. It inhibited CDK2/Cyclin A in an ATP-competitive manner with an IC50 of 808 nM and was selected as a promising template for expansion within a small-molecule CDK2 inhibition program. The combination of X-ray structure determination and molecular modelling allowed us to rationally design two novel and potent CDK2 inhibitors by evaluating the optimal substitutions at two critical regions of the thiazole template. Designed modifications at positions 2 and 5 of the thiazole core system were examined and resulted in a rapid and effective improvement of in vitro CDK2 inhibition. 5.
