A Quantitative Study

The cystal structure of the double-helical B-USA dodecamer of sequence W-C'(:-A-A-T-T-(Y-C-G has been solved and refined independently in three forms : (1) the parent sequence at) room temperature; (2) the same sequence at 16 K : and (3) the Shromo variant (`-(;-C-(:-~~-A-T-TBr~-~~-(`-(`-(: at 7°C' in 6004, (v/v) 2.methyl-2.1. pentanediol. The latter two structures show extensive hydration along the phosphate backbone, a feature that was invisible in the native structure because of high temperature factors (indicating t,hermal or stat'ie disorder) of thtl hackhonc atoms. Sixty-five solvent) peaks are associated with the phosphate backbone. or an average of three per phosphate group. Sinetrcn other molewles form a first shell of hydration to base edge S and 0 at,oms within the major groove, and 36 mow art' found in upper hydration layers. Thv latter tend to occur in strings or cslust)ers spa"ning the major groove from one phosphate group to another. A single spermille molcvule also spans the major groove. In the minor groove, the zig-zag spine of hydration that we helievca to be principally responsible for stabilizing the R form of I)X\`=2 is found in all three structures. I'pper level hydrat~ion in the minor groove is relatively sparse. and consists mainly of strings of water molwules extending awoss the groove. with few contacts to the spine below. Sugar O-l' atoms are closely assoviatrd with water molecules, but these are chiefly molr~ules in the spine. so thv association may reflect the geometr? of the minor groore rather than any int,rinsic. at,traction of O-l' atoms for hgdratmn.

1. Introduction
Any careful structural analysis of DNA must recognize the important role that water plays in stabilizing the double helix. In their earliest) fiber work, Franklin & (:osling (1953) observed that different diffraction patterns were obtained from the same DSA sample depending on t'he relative humidity of the fibers. and hence on

the same conclusions from spectroF)hotornetric studies. During drying to 5,5", relative humidity. four or five water molecules per basr are removed, mainly from base-pair edges in the grooves. while the hydration of tht phosphate backbone remains intact. These phosphate backbone water molecules finally are &sorbed last of all when the relative humidity drops below 6001~. In their gravirnet,ric studies, Falk it rll.

IIickerson. 1981). with the important' WV addition of loc~alized solvent peaks along the phosphat'e backbone. Although peaks are not f'ounti at precisely the same posit'ions in the MPD7 and 16 K structures. thr l)at tern of hydration along the backbone is the same. This is seen in more detail for MPD7 in Figure 3. which shows all 75 peaks that lie within 1.1 Lq of main chain oxygen atoms: 67 associat'ed with phosphate oxygen atoms. and eight with terminal 5' and 3' OH groups. (Four peaks spaced 3% to 4.1 &-! from phosphate Iuwklwne oxygen atoms but buried nitjhin the minor groove are considered later: SW Fig. 8.) The associat,ion of these solvent peaks with the double helix backbone is somrwhat easier to understand in the unrolled helix backbone diagram shown in Figure 1. h`ear1.v three-quarters of the peaks are close enough to the DXA oxygen atoms (35 -4 or less) to form t'rue hydrogen bonds. and the others are more looseI> asscwiatetl.

Individual phosphate groups have one to five solvent peaks within 4.1 A. for an average of 3.OIf: 1.3 peaks (mean and standard deviation). Clustering seems to be most dense in the upper half of the molecule, and this may be because the spermine molecule bridges the major groove. decreasing the mobility of this part of the helix. lowering the mean B values of the phosphate groups to which they are attached and making the associat'ed solvent peaks more visible. Many of the phosphatrassociated peaks are also involved in net)works of peaks extending into and across the major and minor grooves. as will be described lat'er.

The hydration pattern of N and 0 atoms on base edges within the major groove is represented schematically in Figure 5. Kearly every S and 0 has at least one solvent peak in close proximity. and in only one case. peak 100. does the distance suggest that the peak could be a magnesium ion. Some solvent molecules interact with only a single base atom ; other associations are bidentate. bridging two I)K.l, atoms. Bidentate bridging can be of three types. X . ..H `0' (2) s . . H-0 I H

The 20 solvent molecules in Figure 5 (in addition to the spermine peaks) represent a monolayer of water coating the polar edges of bases in the major groorc with slight)lg less than one localized water molecule per base. Obher water moleculer in second and higher hydration levels bridge the major groove in an irregular manner. as depicted in Figure 6. Forty-eight such molecules are sufficientI> localiztld to be risible in the electron density map. They have the appearance of strings of water molecules stretching across the major groove from one phosphat'c bacbkbonr to the ot,her. a feature that was predicted by (`lementi & C'orongiu (1981) from theoretical Monte Carlo simulations of solvent' structure. Although there are coonnections between this upper layer (Fig, 6) and the first hydration monolayer. the!, are not extensive, nor of a regularity comparable with the first and second lrvel hydration in the minor groove spine. It may be that the solvent peaks sh0w.n in Figures 5 and 6 represent Wolf-Hanlon class 1 and 2 water molec&~s. rrsp~ct ively.

(d) The minor

groove spine of hydration

The zig-zag spine of ordered water molecules first observed lining the minor groove in the A +T-rich center of the native B-DiVA helix (Drew & Dickerson, 1981) is also seen in the MPD7 and 16 K helices. As illustrated in Figure 7, a first shell of hydration bridges the adenine N-3 and thymine O-2 atoms (both of them being hydrogen bond acceptors) that are brought into closer proximity by helix rotat,ion. These in turn are bridged by a second layer of molecules that confers tetrahedral bond co-ordination on the first shell water oxygens. approximate Comparison of Figure 7 with Figure 5 of Drew & Dickerson (1981) shows that the geometry of the spine is almost identical in native and MPD7 structures, What was not realized earlier, however, is that the sugar O-l' atoms, which line thr bot)tom of the minor groove and point inward toward this groove (rather than toward t,he major groove). also make a substant'ial contribution to stabilization of' the spine (Fig. 8). Fourteen 0-1'.to-spine distances of 4.1 is or less are observed. of which eight are within reasonable hydrogen bonding distance of 3.5 a. alongside 12 good hydrogen bonds between spine and base edge N and 0. Although some of the distances between O-l' and spine are too great for true hydrogen bonds. all the O-l' atoms certainly contribute to a polar environment deep within t)he minor groove et al. (1960) that would make a spine of water molecules more st)able. (Langridge suggested water bridging between sugar 0-l and O-2 or S-3 at,oms of adjacent bases. but not a longer range spine structure down t,he minor groove.)

as in the nat,ive helix. the integrity of the regular zig-zag spine of hydration begins to crumble when one passes from the A +T-containing center of the molecule t)oward the C + G ends. The spine lifts out' of the bottom of the groove to either end. and ultimat)ely frays int'o a cloud of irregularly positioned solvent peaks. This arises packing occludes the minor groove for the first two in part because intermolecular or t)hree base-pairs in from each end of the helix, but another significant factor is the disruptive effect of hydrogen-donating K-2 amino groups on guanine residues (Drew & Dickerson. 1981 : Dickerson et nl.. 1981.1982). A third factor leading to a more stable spine in A + T-rich regions than G + C-rich is the geometry of the minor groove it'self. As discussed by Fratini et al. (19&Z), the inherentSly greater positive propeller twist of A. T base-pairs than C:. C leads to a displacement of C-l ' atom positions in the A +T center, and to a narrowing of the minor groove. It also twists t)he base planes so the groups that are bridged by first shell hydration in the minor

result's of physical chemistry experiments. All of t'he 114 well-defined solvent peaks are illustrated in one or another of Figures 4.5.6. 8 and 9. Some appear more than once if they occupy bridging positions and play more t'han one significant role with adjacent DNA molecules. Peak 119. for example, int'eracts with phosphat'e 4 on one molecule and phosphate 21 on a neighbor (Fig. 4). Its involvement with I'21 is also sho\f.n in Figure 9 because it extends out over t'he minor groove. as is also clear from the st)ereo view in Figure 3(a). A DSA helix in solution, isolated from neighboring molecules. probably would hare individual water molecules occupying both P4 and El sit,es. so peak 119 must be counted twice if a fair impression of the degree of hydration of isolated DSA molecules is to be obtained. L2Yth this ccr~&. a census of t)he solvent, peaks around an isolated DS*\ dodec~amer. as derived from these Figures. is given in Table 2. Among what LVolf & Hanlon would term class 1 peaks. interacting direct'ly with the DXA. we can see an average of t)hree peaks per backbone phosphate group and two from the grooves (one eac*h from major and minor). exactly half t,he tot)al predicted b\- them. This c~)uld br a real effect, but is more likely to represent simply the degree of localization of water molecules at fixed positions at all DNA helices of the crystal. under our experimental conditions. ?(-ray analysis cannot see solvent, molecules t,hat occiput varying positions from one D?r'A helix t'o the next. Of the eight upper shell or class 2 solvent molecules per nucleotide predicted b? \\`olf' C! Hanlon. we can see an average of two. This probably arises from a c*ombination of four factors : t'he previously mentioned incomplet,e localization of u-at,er molecules throughout the crystal, int,erference with upper level patterns of hydration arising from the close proximit'y of neighboring molecules. the limited resolution of the N-ray analysis (2.3 -i). and the fact that the liquid into which the crystals were transferred after growth is 60"/, MYD and only -CO':&water. The consequence of all the above factors is that we see five class 1 hydration peaks per

A4side from t,he minor groove spine. about which E'alk et nl. (1963a,b) could not hare known. t'he next most thoroughly hydrated loci are t'he free phosphate oxygen atoms as they predicted, with (X0', involved in valid hydrogen bonds and another ZP,, in looser associations. Following these come the O-l' atoms of sugar rings. again in agreement with t,he early infrared studies. Half of the O-l' atoms in Figure X are within 35 -4 of a water molecule. and 93O,, are within 4.1 8. But nearI) all of' these wat'er molecules belong to the minor groove spine, and their proximit) to O-l' atoms probably is a consequence of the st'ructure of the minor groove rather than to any innate attract,ion by O-l' atoms. Hence the significance of the O-1' hydration in R-D?\`A is not clear. The faint broken lines in Figure 7 show how each first-shell water molecule of the spine is flanked by two O-l' atoms projecting from the t1f.o w,alls of the minor groove. Major groove base edge S and 0 atoms are next in strengt'h of hydration, and main cdhain phosphate O-3' and O-5' atoms are last. with virtually equal affinities. As (aan br seen in Figure i. there are no steric factors that would restrain hydration at the O-S' and O-5' positions. so this must represent a genuine lack of attraction for water molecules. In sum, t)he empirical order of decreasing affinit,y from Y-ra! analvsis of the &DNA dodecamer st,ructures is: (I ) (2) (3) (1) (5) Minor groove spine (data only frorn X +T-rich region) Free phosphate oxygen at'oms. Sugar O-1' atoms (uncertain significance). Major groove base edge N and 0 atoms. EMerified O-3' and O-5' phosphat,e oxygen at'oms.

The reason for the relatively sparse hydration of backbone O-3' and O-5' atoms is not c.lear. sinw there appear to be no st,eric factors that would prevent access to thrsrs atoms by water molecules. The issue of the int,rinsic attraction of sugar O-l' atoms for hydrating molecules wilt have to wait, upon detailed examination of the A helix. in which the O-l' atorns are not located close to an ordered spine of hydration. Our analysis of the detailed hydration pattern in R-DSA representIs generally both a conformation and an ext)ension of the knowledge of' DSA hydration derived from non-cry&allographic methods of analysis. \Vf, thank IGn (`onn~r for disc-ussions of hydration in -4 -1)NA and B-DNA in advanw of puhlieatiotl of his .-I-helic*al (`-(`Y-C: hydration analysis. and IVat-d Smith for help with ()K'TEI I)rogram atiaptation.
