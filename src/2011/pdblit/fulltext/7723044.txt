Human interleukin 2 (IL-2) was radioiodinated by a modified form of the chloraraine-T reaction. Comparison with biosynthetically radiolabeled IL-2 demonstrated that the iodinated molecule retained similar receptor binding characteristics and proliferation-inducing ability. The iodinated molecule also possessed the distinct advantages of a higher specific radioactivity and a reduced processing time for the assay samples. The majority of the iodine was incorporated at the tyrosine in position 45 of the polypeptide chain. Evidently, this residue is unimportant for the molecule's association with its receptor. The development of active radioiodinated IL-2 should facilitate routine measurement of the high-affinity IL-2 binding sites which mediate the physiological response to this lymphokine. Key words: interleukin 2 - radioiodination- receptor binding- lymphokines

Introduction Interleukin 2 (IL-2, formally called T-cell growth factor) is an antigen-non-specific modulator of several immune responses. Among these are proliferation of activated T and certain activated B cells, enhancement of natural killer cell activity and induction of immunoglobulin and gamma-interferon secretion (Robb, 1984). Often such responses involve a complex interaction of different cell types and multiple lymphokines. Moreover, conditions must be optimal both for secretion of the soluble mediators and for induction of specific cell surface receptors on their target cells. In fact, the inability to produce or respond to lymphokines such as IL-2 has been

16 implicated in a number of disease states including autoimmunity (Linker-Israeli et al., 1983), AIDS (Pallidino et al., 1984) and cancer (Rey et al., 1983). In the case of IL-2, Robb and colleagues (Robb et al., 1981) used biosynthetically radiolabeled factor to demonstrate the presence on activated T cells of small numbers (1000-5000 per cell) of specific, high-affinity (dissociation constant- 5 pM) binding sites. This observation was later extended to reveal an additional, more numerous class (or classes) of binding sites with a much lower apparent affinity (K d - 10-30 nM) (Robb et al., 1984a, 1985b). Both classes of binding sites were shown to be composed of a 55,000 MW glycoprotein recognized by the monoclonal antibody, anti-Tac (Robb and Greene, 1983; Robb et al., 1984a). The molecular basis for the high- and low-affinity forms of the molecule is still uncertain, although phosphorylation, dimerization and interaction of the Tac protein with distinct subunits have been proposed (Farrar and Taguchi, 1985; Robb et al., 1984a; Greene et al., 1985; Robb, 1985b). The ratio of high- to low-affinity forms of the receptor varied between cell types and between states of cellular activation (Robb et al., 1984a). Thus, the level of binding of the anti-Tac antibody was not always an accurate measure of the capacity of cells for high-affinity interaction with IL-2. Since it is the high-affinity form of the receptor which mediates most or all of the physiological effects of the growth factor (Robb et al., 1981; Robb, 1984), analysis of the role of IL-2 in a cellular response requires direct measurement of high-affinity ligand binding. Although IL-2 biosynthetically labeled with radioactive amino acids was successfully used for receptor binding measurements (Robb et al., 1983), such measurements were restricted by several factors. These included the relatively low specific radioactivity of the probe (generally under 106 dpm/pmol), the need for special high IL-2-producing cell lines and the expense of the radiolabeled amino acids. Numerous attempts at incorporation of an external label, such as 1251, generally resulted in partial or total loss of high-affinity receptor binding (Robb et al., 1981; Greene and Robb, 1985). In those early attempts which involved iodination of tyrosine, no special precautions were taken to minimize oxidation of susceptible residues on the IL-2 protein which might be essential for bioactivity. In this paper, we use a method for iodination which retains the bioactivity of the IL-2 molecule. Comparison of radioiodinated IL-2 and biosynthetically labeled IL-2 demonstrates that both probes have nearly identical high-affinity interactions with the cellular IL-2 receptor.

Materials and Methods
Interleukin 2

IL-2 was prepared from a high-producer subclone (J6.8.9.15.32.23) of the human cell line JURKAT following stimulation (16 h) in serum-free DMEM with 1.5 /~g/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; HA-16, Welcome Reagents, U.K.) and 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristic 13-acetate (PMA, Consolidated Midlands Corp., Brewster, NY) (Robb et al., 1983). The crude cell supernatant was fractionated on an immunoaffinity column coupled with murine monoclonal antibody 46C8-A2 which selectively

17 binds human IL-2 containing N-acetyl-D-galactosamine attached to the threonine in position 3 of the polypeptide chain (Robb et al., 1984b; Robb, 1985a). Bound IL-2 was eluted from the affinity column with 1.5% acetic acid. This material was judged to be greater than 98% pure by SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC analysis and possessed a specific activity of 12.9 × 106 BRMP units/mg protein (Robb et al., 1984b).

Bioassay for IL-2
The biological activity of IL-2 was determined by its effect on the uptake of [3H]thymidine ([3H]Tdr) by an IL-2-dependent, cloned murine T cell line (CTLL-2, subclone 15H) (Gillis et al., 1978). Serial dilutions (100/~1) of unknown samples and a standard IL-2 preparation, provided by the Biological Response Modifiers Program (BRMP) of the National Cancer Institute, were combined with 4000 CTLL-2 cells (100/~1 volume) and incubated 20 h at 37°C. The cultures were then pulsed for 4 h with 50/~1 medium containing 0.5/~Ci [3H]Tdr (6.7 Ci/mmol, Du Pont-NEN, Boston, MA), followed by harvesting of the cells on glass fiber strips (Titertek cell harvester, Flow Laboratories, Rockville, MD). The reciprocal of the dilution of the unknown sample yielding half-maximal [3H]Tdr incorporation was divided by that of the standard to give IL-2 activity in BRMP units per ml. The BRMP standard was arbitrarily assigned a value of 500 U / m l and generally yielded 50% [3H]Tdr incorporation at a final dilution (200/~1 volume) of 1 : 400.

Biosynthetic radiolabeling of IL-2
IL-2 was labeled biosynthetically as previously described (Robb et al., 1981, 1984a). JURKAT cells were resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in leucine, lysine-free DMEM (Grand Island Biological Co., New York) to which was added 40 /~M unlabeled leucine, 65 #M unlabeled lysine and 0.75 mCi/ml each of [4,5-3H]leucine (40 Ci/mmol) and [4,5-3H]lysine (48 Ci/mmol). The cells were stimulated with 1.5 /~g/ml PHA and 50 ng/ml PMA. The cell supernatant was harvested after 16 h at 37°C and fractionated on the 46C8-A2 immunoaffinity column to yield the GalNAc-derivative of IL-2. In this instance, the column was eluted with 1.5% acetic acid containing 1 mg/ml affinity-purified bovine serum albumin (BSA, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) as a carrier. When chromatographed on a 4.6 × 75 mm RPSC-C 3 reverse-phase column (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) this material eluted as a single major peak at 48% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoracetic acid, TFA). The fractions (1 ml) were collected into polypropylene tubes containing 1 ml of 1 mg/ml affinity-purified BSA. The acetonitrile was partially removed under a stream of nitrogen and the sample was equilibrated in 10 mM Tris pH 7.5,0.14 M NaC1 on a YM-5 membrane using a Model 3 stirred mini-cell (Amicon, Lexington, MA). The IL-2 content of the probe was estimated by repeatedly measuring its bioactivity in the [3H]Tdr assay and converting the average value (1.16 + 0.08 × 104 BRMP units/ml) to terms of protein based on a specific bioactivity of 12.9 x 106 BRMP units per mg of IL-2 (i.e., 11,600/12.9 × 106 or 8.98 × 10 -4 mg/ml). At 25.6 × 106 dpm [3H]/ml, the specific radioactivity was thus 2.85 × 101° d p m / m g IL-2 or 4.5 × 105 dpm/pmole, assuming a molecular weight of 15,500 (Robb et al.,

18 1983; Taniguchi et al., 1983). This value corresponds to an average of 6.6 atoms of 3H per molecule of IL-2 or about 53% of the maximum incorporation (22 leucine and 11 lysine residues per molecule) expected from the final specific activities of the combined radioactive and non-radioactive leucine and lysine. The GalNAc-derivative of IL-2 which was selected by the immunoaffinity column made up only 60% of the IL-2 released by the JURKAT cells ( R o b b e t al., 1984b). Thus, the combined recovery of the immunoaffinity column and the reverse-phase HPLC step was about 45% of the original IL-2 activity in the cell supernatant. The conditions for biosynthetic labeling which were required to maximize the specific radioactivity of the final product (i.e., low levels of unlabeled leucine and lysine and high levels of 3H) also tended to depress (by 50-80%) IL-2 production by the JURKAT cells. From the original 20 ml culture containing 30 mCi of [3H]labeled amino acids, approximately 8800 BRMP units or 43 pmol of [3H]IL-2 were recovered. This material was sufficient for approximately 480 assays of high-affinity receptor binding (see below).

Radioiodination of IL-2 Immunoaffinity-purified JURKAT-derived IL-2 was radioiodinated with Na125I (NEZ-033H, Du Pont-NEN) using a modified chloramine-T method (Hunter and Greenwood, 1962). In this method, the NalZSI was first oxidized by chloramine-T, followed by addition of the protein. As previously described for other protein and hormone molecules (Berson and Yalow, 1973; Roth, 1975), minimal, stoichiometric amounts of radioiodine and chloramine-T were employed in order to limit oxidation of sensitive amino acids (i.e., cysteine and methionine). Indeed, functional analysis of different iodinated IL-2 preparations indicated that receptor binding and bioactivity were very dependent on the amount of chloramine-T employed, even where the level of iodine incorporation was the same (unpublished observations). The IL-2 (50 /~g) and chloramine-T/Na125I mixture (2.5 mCi 125I or about 1 atom of I per 3 molecules of IL-2) were incubated for 10 rain at 20°C, followed by quenching of the reaction with sodium metabisulfite. The reaction mixture was injected directly onto a wide pore, reverse-phase HPLC column and separated with a gradient of acetonitrile (see Fig. 1 legend). Fractions (1 ml) were collected into tubes containing 1 ml 0.4% BSA and immediately diluted to 25/LCi/ml. The a25I-IL-2 from the HPLC step was pooled and repurified on the 46C8-A2 immunoaffinity column. About 90% of the radiolabel bound to this column and was recovered by a low pH elution. A typical overall recovery for all the steps was 30% of the original aliquot of IL-2 (15/~g or 970 pmol, sufficient for 11,000 binding assays). The a25I-IL-2 was stored in 1.5% acetic acid containing 1 mg/ml BSA at either - 2 0 ° C or 4°C, with no detectable loss of bioactivity over a period of 6 weeks. The specific radioactivity of the lzsI-IL-2 preparation was measured in 2 ways. In the first approach, the percentage of 125I incorporated into tyrosine residues on the IL-2 protein was determined. An aliquot of the radioiodination reaction mixture was spotted onto an ITLC strip (Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI) and the strip was developed in 0.15 M NaCI. The labeled IL-2 remained at the origin while the free 125I migrated with the solvent front. About 92% of the 125I was incorporated, yielding a specific

19 radioactivity of 45/~Ci//~g IL-2 (about I atom of iodine per 3 molecules of IL-2) or 1.55 × 106 dpm/pmole. In the second approach, which was also used for the biosynthetically labeled IL-2, the concentration of IL-2 following purification by reverse-phase and immunoaffinity chromatography was determined with the bioassay. The purified 125I-IL-2 pool contained 1.33 -t- 0.2 × 10 4 BRMP units, or about 1.03 × 10 -3 mg, of actioe IL-2 per ml. At 120 × 106 dpm [125I]/ml, the specific radioactivity was estimated to be 1.17 × 10 H dpm/mg or 1.82 × 106 dpm/pmol. The retention of IL-2 bioactivity was evidently high since the estimate based on the bioassay result was close to that obtained by direct measurement of 125I incorporation. Since only about a third of the IL-2 molecules contained an iodine atom, however, any effect of the iodine on .the overall bioactivity would be partially masked by the contribution of the more numerous unlabeled molecules. An average of the values from the 2 approaches was used in all subsequent calculations of receptor number and affinity. This value (1.69 × 106 dpm/pmol) was almost 4 times the specific radioactivity of the [3H]IL-2 probe.

Receptor binding assays
High-affinity receptor binding was measured by incubating (in 1.5 ml Eppendorf micro test tubes, Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY) serial dilutions of the radiolabeled IL-2 (from 300 pM initial concentration to 3 pM final concentration) with 0.4-0.6 × 106 cells in a total volume of 100 #l RPMI 1640 containing 10 mg/ml BSA (RPMI-BSA). The tubes were mechanically rotated about their longest axis (horizontal position) at 20 rpm in a 37°C water both for 15 rain. Following this incubation period, 1 ml ice-cold RPMI-BSA was added to each tube and the cells were pelleted by spinning in a Beckman microfuge 12 at 9000 x g for 20 s. The supernatant was removed and used to determine the level of unbound IL-2. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 /~l RPMI-BSA and centrifuged (9000 × g for 90 s) through a 200/~l layer of a mixture of 84% silicone oil (550 fluid; Contour Chemical Co., North Reading, MA) and 16% paraffin oil (Fisher Scientific Co., Philadelphia, PA) to remove the small m o u n t of residual unbound radioactivity. For 125I-IL-2, the tips of the tubes containing the cell pellet were cut off and counted directly. For [3H]IL-2, the tips were transferred to 20 ml glass scintillation vials. The cells were expelled from the tips using 200/~l phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized by the addition of 200 /~l 1% SDS, followed by 10 ml Biofluor (DuPont-NEN, Boston, MA). The 3H radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation on a Tri-Carb 4640 (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Greene, IL) and the 125I radioactivity was determined on a Clinigamma Quatro gamma counter (LKB Instruments, Gaithersburg, MD). The efficiency of counting for the cell-bound and unbound [3H]IL-2 were 46% and 41%, respectively, while the corresponding values for 125I-IL-2 were 78% and 73%.

22 protein (with about 40% of the injected radioiodine) eluting at about 80 min (Fig. 1). The major impurities were oxidation byproducts which emerged early in the chromatogram. The HPLC protein peak was pooled and the IL-2 was extracted on an anti-IL-2 immunoaffinity column. Following the 2-step fractionation, the final purity of each of the labeled probes was judged to exceed 98% on the basis of SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC analysis (Fig. 2). The 125I-IL-2 migrated slightly slower than [3H]IL-2 under both reducing and non-reducing conditions on gel electrophoresis. The presence of iodine, however, made little difference on the retention time of the intact molecule on reverse-phase chromatography. Human IL-2 contains 3 tyrosine residues (positions 31, 45 and 107, Fig. 3B). To determine the relative incorporation of radioiodine into each, the 125I-IL-2 (plus unlabeled IL-2 as a carrier) was cleaved with trypsin and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 3A). The tryptic peptides of unlabeled IL-2 served as markers since the elution time of each was known (Robb et al., 1984b; Robb, 1985a). About 82% of the total recovered radioiodine eluted in a 3 peak pattern (peaks a, b, c) between 32 and 38% acetonitrile. This proportion varied only slightly with changes in the amount of chloramine-T employed during radioiodination. The major radioiodine peaks, labeled a and b, had slightly later elution times than unlabeled peptides p44-48 and p44-48ox. The covalent linkage of iodine typically increases the retention time on reverse-phase supports (particularly of small peptides) while the oxidation of methionine residues (positions 23, 39, 44 and 104) generally reduces the retention time (unpublished observations). Thus, 125I-peaks a and b were identified as oxidized and unoxidized derivatives of p44-48, with the iodine incorporated at Tyr-45. Peak c was most likely a diiodo-derivative of p44-48 with the second iodine contributing to yet a longer retention time. This conclusion is supported by the finding that the abundance of peak c relative to peaks a and b corresponded roughly to the proportion of diiodotyrosine seen in a total pronase hydrolysate of 125I-IL-2 (there was no incorporation of 1251 into amino acids other than tyrosine). The minor 125I-peaks labeled d and e (2% of total radiolabel) were nearly coincident with the elution positions of p98-120 and its corresponding sulfoxide form. The remaining radiolabel (region f, 16% of total 125I) which eluted from the column formed a heterogeneous profile at the end of the chromatogram. Some of this label may have been incorporated at Tyr-31 which is contained in the very hydrophobic peptide p10-32. The late elution position and heterogeneous profile, however, suggests that this label was, in part, contained in partial cleavage fragments. Since no such fragments were observed in the A210 profile of peptides from unlabeled IL-2 (Fig. 3A), it is possible that incorporation of iodine at one of the tyrosine residues or oxidation of one of the methionines could have contributed to incomplete cleavage. Previous attempts at radioiodination of IL-2 resulted in loss of much of the bioactivity of the sample (Robb et al., 1981; Greene and Robb, 1985). To assess the proportion of labeled molecules capable of specific interaction with cellular receptors in the present preparations, a constant amount of labeled IL-2 was incubated with increasing numbers of ceils of the receptor-positive cell line, H U T 102B2 (Robb et al., 1981). As the ratio of chloramine-T to IL-2 was reduced, a dramatic increase

A constant amount of IL-2 (13 fmol) was incubated with increasing numbers of HUT 102B2 cells in a total volume of 0.1 ml for 15 min at 37°C. After incubation, free and bound IL-2 were separated as described under Methods. Non-specific binding was determined by including 50 pmol unlabeled IL-2 in parallel sets of tubes. The level of non-competible binding ([3H]IL-2, I ; 125I-IL-2, t2) was similar for both probes and increased linearly from 0.05% of the input radiolabel at the lowest cell level to 1.4% at the highest cell level.

was seen in the fraction of iodinated molecules capable of specific cellular association (from 30% to 95+%). In fact, the binding curve for 125I-IL-2 at the lowest chloramine-T level employed was virtually identical to that of biosynthetically radiolabeled [3H]IL-2 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, up to 95% of the radiolabeled molecules in each of the preparations was specifically bound by the cells under conditions of extreme receptor excess. Non-specific binding, as assessed by competition with unlabeled IL-2, was less than 2% for both probes. Thus, the vast majority of the radiolabel in both the biosynthetically labeled and radioiodinated preparations was associated with IL-2 molecules capable of specific interaction with the cellular receptor. Although almost all the radioiodinated IL-2 was cell-bound under conditions of receptor excess, incorporation of iodine could affect the affinity of the IL-2-receptor interaction. To examine this question, competitive binding curves were generated by mixing increasing quantities of unlabeled IL-2 with a constant amount of the 2 labeled probes (Fig. 5). Once again, the results for both [3H]IL-2 and 12sI-IL-2 were

very similar. More importantly, the concentration of unlabeled IL-2 necessary to cause a 50% reduction in the control level of bound radiolabel was equal to the concentration of the labeled probes. Thus, in both cases, the labeled molecules and

Fig. 6. A: typical curve for the binding of [3H]IL-2 and ]25I-IL-2 to HUT 102B2 cells (470,000 cells in 0.1 ml total volume). The specific radioactivities of the probes (4.5×10 5 dpm/pmol for [3H]IL-2 and 1.69x 106 dpm/pmol for 125I-IL-2) were used to convert the maximum levels of bound radioactivity to the number of receptor binding sites (R) per cell. Note that the higher specific radioactivity of 125I-1L-2 considerably facilitated the measurement of bound and free radioactivity at low IL-2 concentrations. B: Scatchard plot of the data in A. The specific radioactivities of the probes were used to convert the slopes of the lines into values of the dissociation constant (Kd) with units of pM.

27 unlabeled molecules showed similar characteristics of receptor association. As a direct comparison of the use of the 2 probes, receptor association assays were performed on a number of cell types. Binding of ~25I-IL-2 and [3H]IL-2 to the HUT 102B2 cells resulted in relatively linear Scatchard plots (Fig. 6), demonstrating that both the high-affinity receptors and the radiolabeled probes were homogeneous in their association characteristics. With respect to the reliability of the data, the higher specific radioactivity of the 125I-IL-2 preparation offered a distinct advantage over the [3H]IL-2 preparation, particularly when the greater efficiency of 125I detection is considered. The estimates of the number of receptor binding sites and of the dissociation constant (K a) were reasonably close using the 2 probes (Table I). The 125I-IL-2 values were somewhat lower than the [3H]IL-2 values for the 2 human cell types, HUT 102B2 and PHA blasts, but about'the same for the IL-2-dependent, murine cell line CTLL-2. There was no specific binding of either [3H]IL-2 or 125I-IL-2 to the receptor-negative JURKAT cell line (data not shown).

Discussion

These results demonstrate that IL-2 radioiodinated under mild oxidative conditions behaves similarly to biosynthetically radiolabeled IL-2 and unlabeled IL-2 in its interactions with the cellular IL-2 receptor. The vast majority (at least 95%) of label in both the 1251- and 3H-probes was incorporated in molecules capable of specific receptor association and the level of non-specific, non-competible binding was extremely low in both cases (Fig. 4). Thus, the 125I-IL-2 was as suitable for receptor binding measurements as the biosynthetically labeled factor. Moreover, the radioiodinated preparation offered the distinct advantages of a higher specific radioactivity and a higher efficiency of detection (75% versus 44%). The use of 125I-IL-2 also avoided the time-consuming preparation of the samples for liquid scintillation and the need for special, high IL-2-producing cell lines. The same methodology used for cell line-derived IL-2 was applicable to radioiodination of IL-2 prepared by recombinant DNA techniques (unpublished observations). The estimates of the receptor number and dissociation constant were reasonably similar when the 125I-IL-2 and [3H]IL-2 probes were compared. The values for the murine cell line which was used to estimate the protein content, however, were closer than those for the 2 human cell populations. This discrepancy could arise if the specific biological activity of the 125I-IL-2 preparation differed on human and murine cells. In fact, however, the proliferation-inducing capacity of the radioiodinated probe on human PHA-blast cells was within 8% of the value measured on the CTLL-2 cells (data not shown). The efficacy of unlabeled IL-2 in competing for the binding of 125I-IL-2 and of [3H]IL-2 on human cells was also equivalent (Fig. 5), implying that the same number of molecules compose a unit of bioactivity in each probe. In addition, the rates of internalization (Robb and Lin, 1984) of cell-bound 125I-IL-2 and [3H]IL-2 were the same when measured on human cells (data not shown). Thus, in several respects the [3H]IL-2 and 125I-IL-2 behaved

28 identically. The discrepancy between the 2 probes on human cells represents a 20-25% difference in the estimates of both receptor number and K d. Such a parallel deviation could arise from an overestimation of the specific radioactivity of the 125I-probe or an underestimation of the value for the 3H-probe, or both. In fact, variations of this magnitude were not uncommon in the results from two independent preparations of [3H]IL-2 and may simply be a reflection of the inherent inaccuracies of the bioassay and binding measurements (R. Robb, unpublished observations). Such fluctuations are of little consequence as long as an entire experiment is performed with a single probe. Peptide mapping of the radioiodinated IL-2 indicated that the vast majority (> 82%) of the iodine was incorporated at Tyr-45 (Fig. 3A). This result, however, is based only on the radiolabel recovered in the peptide peaks (a total of 85% of the input radiolabel). Although the recovery of unlabeled peptides p44-48 and p98-120 was generally the same, that of p10-32 was often lower (R. Robb, unpublished observations). Therefore, the proportion of ~25I incorporated into Tyr-31 (< 16%) may be somewhat underestimated. In any case, Tyr-45 appears to be exposed and preferentially iodinated while Tyr-107, which is located near a cysteine residue (Cys-105) involved in the intramolecular disulfide bond, is far less reactive. The region surrounding Tyr-45 contains many charged amino acids which are likely to be exposed on the molecule's surface. This expectation is supported by the fact that a monoclonal antibody (9B11-lE5) which neutralizes IL-2-bioactivity reacts with a synthetic peptide (residues 33-54) containing Tyr-45 (Robb, 1984, 1985b). If this section of the molecule is involved in receptor binding, as is implied by the finding that antibody 9B11-lE5 directly interferes with receptor association (Robb, 1984), then the hydroxylphenyl sidechain of Tyr-45 is not essential. Virtually all of the 125I-IL-2 was capable of receptor association (Fig. 4) and the Scatchard plot of the binding (Fig. 6B) did not demonstrate any significant heterogeneity in receptor affinity within the pool of iodinated molecules. The peptide map of 125I-IL-2 also indicated a considerable degree of oxidation ( - 3 2 % ) of Met-46 (Fig. 3A). This proportion exceeded the extent of oxidation ( < 10%) of the unlabeled carrier peptide p44-48. In fact, oxidation of Met-46 may be favored by incorporation of iodine at the adjacent position (Tyr-45) of the polypeptide chain. When larger amounts of chloramine-T were used in the iodination reaction up to 65% of p44-48 was in the oxidized form. Nevertheless, molecules with such high levels of Met-46 oxidation were recovered by low pH elution of cell-bound 125I-IL-2 and were completely active in subsequent cell proliferation and receptor binding assays (data not shown). If the oxidation of Met-46 occurred during the iodination reaction and not during preparation and analysis of the tryptic peptides, it would appear that the state of Met-46 oxidation is unimportant in the molecule's association with the receptor. Notwithstanding this observation, both the bioactivity and receptor binding were clearly susceptible to oxidative modification of some residue(s) in the molecule, since the proportion of active IL-2 was considerably lower at higher levels of chloramine-T. The most likely candidates for the susceptible residue(s) are the remaining methionines at positions 23, 39 and 104 and the free cysteine at position 125. Cys-125 could be replaced by serine without affecting the

29

molecule's bioactivity (Wang et al., 1984), but deletion of this residue or the adjacent Phe-124 and Gln-126 (Liang et al., 1985) or deletion of the C-terminal 16 amino acids (R. Robb, Y. Lin, and J. Gray, unpublished observation) resulted in an inactive molecule. Thus, although the sulfhydral group of Cys-125 might not be absolutely necessary, its oxidation could conceivably affect the conformation of the critical C-terminal region. Alternatively, the loss of function could be due to modification of the intramolecular disulfide bridge (connecting Cys-58 and Cys-105) which is essential for maintaining an active conformation of the molecule (Robb et al., 1984b; Wang et al., 1984). From past experience with small peptides (R. Garlick, unpublished observations), however, the reaction conditions employed during the radioiodination procedure (i.e., oxidation with chloramine-T and reduction with sodium metabisulfite) were not sufficiently extreme to affect disulfide linkages (in particular, the loss of bioactivity was directly related to the chloramine-T concentration and not the metabisulfite concentration, which was kept constant). Therefore, any loss of IL-2 activity was probably not due to modification of this bond. Considerable progress in the molecular characterization of the IL-2 receptor has accompanied the introduction of the monoclonal antibody, anti-Tac, which recognizes the IL-2-binding component (both high- and low-affinity forms) on the cell surface (Robb and Greene, 1983; Leonard et al., 1983). In fact, the mRNA encoding the 55,000 MW binding chain was recently cloned, sequenced and expressed in mammalian cells (Leonard et al., 1984; Greene et al., 1985). Nevertheless, since it is the high-affinity form of the receptor which mediates most, if not all, of the physiological responses to IL-2 and since the ratio of high- to low-affinity binding sites is variable (Robb et al., 1984a), direct ligand binding measurements are the most accurate means for determining the capacity of a cell population for a functional interaction with this lymphokine. Active 125I-IL-2 should facilitate the application of such measurements to a full range of scientific and clinical investigations.
