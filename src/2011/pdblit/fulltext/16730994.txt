Abstract The hydrophilic poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (PHPMA) was used for RNase A or BS-RNase modification to prevent their degradation in bloodstream or fast elimination. Two PHPMA chains (classic and star-like) were synthesized and their conjugates with both enzymes were tested on the CD-1 nude mice bearing various human tumors. These RNase conjugates injected intravenously or intraperitoneally into the mice bearing melanoma, neuroblastoma or ovarian tumor caused significant reduction of transplanted tumors following ten daily doses of 2.5 and/or 1 mg/kg, respectively, while free RNase A or BSRNase injected in doses of 10 mg/kg exerted only negligible antitumor activity. Histological examination confirmed potent cytotoxic effect of RNase A conjugates in ovarian tumor. Despite the antitumor activity observed in vivo, the in vitro cytotoxic activity of RNase A conjugates was not pronounced and did not differ from that caused by the free RNase A. The in vitro experiments with 125I-labeled preparations demonstrated that polymer conjugates were internalized by tumor cells very poorly in contrast to the dose-dependent internalization of the wild enzyme preparation. Surprisingly, mice injected with EL-4 leukemic cells, which were preincubated for 4 h with BS-RNase conjugates, exerted significantly prolonged survival compared with the control non-treated mice. It may be supposed that both BS-RNase and RNase A conjugates with PHPMA act after administration in vivo by a mechanism different from that or those occurring under in vitro conditions because in vivo they exert an antitumor action, whereas in vitro, they are ineffective. The experiments proved that RNase A, when conjugated to PHPMA, produced identical aspermatogenic and antitumor effects as BS-RNase conjugated to this polymer and that this preparation may be regarded as a potential anticancer drug.

already many years ago [5,12], but this action has not been later confirmed by other authors [15,21]. Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase), a dimeric homolog of RNase A, is cytotoxic to various tumor cells, while unimer BS-RNase and RNase A do not show any antitumor activity [2,4,9]. In the last years, attention has been paid to the modification of RNase A, BS-RNase and human pancreatic ribonuclease and to the study of their effect on various experimental tumors [12,19,25,26]. The preparation of a stable dimer of RNase A led to a significant increase of its antitumor activity [1,27]. Dimeric RNase A active against tumor cells has been also obtained by site-directed mutagenesis [6]. Preparation of RNase A aggregates from dimers to tetramers has shown that the ability to degrade double-stranded RNA and to possess antitumor activity increases in going from dimers to oligomers while in monomeric RNase is absent [17]. Our recent studies on athymic nude mice bearing various human tumors [3,20,22] have proven that the antitumor action of BS-RNase differs, depending on the mode of drug injection. While intratumoral administration of BS-RNase or its injection in the vicinity of the tumor caused potent reduction of tumors, intravenous or intraperitoneal treatment was ineffective. It has been suggested that native RNase A injected in blood vessel has a very short half-life and is eliminated in a few minutes from the organism [27]. Recently, hydrophilic poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (PHPMA) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) were used to modify bovine seminal and bovine pancreatic ribonucleases and prevent their degradation or fast elimination. Beneficial therapeutic effects of these polymer conjugates were proven in mice bearing human melanoma [16,23,29] and its lung-metastasing form [24], and, in addition, their prolonged retention in blood of treated animals was determined [24]. In this paper, we enlarged our attention on the therapeutic effect of RNase A and BS-RNase polymer conjugates administered intravenously or intraperitoneally into athymic nude mice bearing three different human tumors. We also attempted to understand the mode of action of polymer-conjugated RNases.

2. Material and methods 2.1. Ribonuclease preparations Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A) was purchased from Sigma. Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase) was isolated from bull seminal vesicles and purified as previously described [7]. 2.2. Polymer conjugates Star polymer BS-RNase and star polymer RNase A conjugates were prepared by aminolysis of precursor 1 with the respective unimer or dimer enzyme in water using pH-stat radiometer and classic conjugates, branched polymers consisting of one or more RNase molecules linked via polymer chains were prepared as reported in our previous publications [23,24,29]. The contents of BS-RNase and RNase A were calculated using results of amino acid analysis. The purity of conjugates was checked by SDS ­PAGE electrophoresis on gradient gels 7­ 15 Phastsystem (Pharmacia LKB) and by GPC [28,29]. No native enzymes (BS-RNase and RNase A) or polymer were detected. 2.3. BS-RNase labelling Samples of BS-RNase and its polymeric conjugate (200 Ag of protein) were labeled with 1 mCi carrier-free Na125I in a glass vial coated with 100 Ag of IODO-GEN following the manufacturer's instruction as previously described [8]. The iodinated protein was isolated by passing the reaction mixture over Bio-Gel P-6 column (0.9 Â 5 cm) equilibrated with PBS. 0.2 ml aliquots were eluted with PBS and the fifth fraction with the highest specific activity was used. For binding experiments, ML-2 cells were incubated at 37 jC with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled BS-RNase preparations. After 70 min, cells were centrifuged, washed with PBS and treated at 0 jC for 2 min with 1 ml of 0.6 M NaCl. The supernatant and 1 ml PBS wash were collected and kept for measurement of the released radioactivity. Then, 1 ml of 0.1 M NaOH was added, and cell pellets were left overnight for measuring the incorporated radioactivity in a g-counter.

2.4. Antitumor effect 2.4.1. Cell culture The cell line ML-2 derived from human myeloid leukemia was used for testing RNase inhibition activity as described previously [22,25]. A total of 2 Â 105 cells in 0.2 ml of the RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10% v/v) were established in micro titer plates (NUNC, FB type) and cultivated in humidified atmosphere containing 5% of CO2 for 48 h. Simultaneously, a known concentration of RNase was added to each triplicate culture. Four hours before the termination of cultivation, the samples were pulsed with 24 kBq of [6-3H]-thymidine (specific activity 980 GBq/mmol, Institute for Research, Development and Application of Radioisotopes, Prague, Czech Republic). Cells were then collected with a Scatron harvester, and the incorporated radioactivity was evaluated with a Beckman scintillation counter. The mean value of the three cultures containing a particular ribonuclease was compared with that for untreated control cells. 2.4.2. Mice Antitumor activity of free RNase A, BS-RNase and their PHPMA conjugates was tested on athymic female nude mice CD-1 (AnLab-Charles River) weighing 18­ 20 g. The mice were housed under aseptic conditions in cages with bedding (SAWI Research Bedding) sterilized by irradiation and fed with sterile diet as referred previously [20,22]. Human melanoma was obtained from a surgical specimen and pieces 3 Â 3 mm were transplanted subcutaneously on the right flank of the mouse. Neuroblastoma and ovarian tumor cells sustained in a culture were injected at the concentration of 107 cells/mouse in the same way. Treatment of the mice started when the area of the transplanted tumor reached about 5 Â 5 mm. RNase preparations were administered daily with breaks on weekends, usually for 2 weeks. The daily dose of conjugated preparations was calculated as milligrams of native RNase per kilogram of body weight. Detailed conditions of experiment and the preparations used are indicated in the legends of individual experiments. Leukemia cells EL-4 sustained in a culture were pre-incubated with BS-RNase conjugates at the

concentration of 5 mg/3 Â 106 cells/ml of basic MEM medium for 4 h, and then 0.1 ml of this cell suspension was injected s.c. or i.p. into the mice C57/Bl/6. During the following 2 months, mice survival was followed compared to the survival of controls injected with EL-4 cells preincubated only with medium. 2.5. Aspermatogenic effect The aspermatogenic effect of RNase A, BS-RNase and their conjugates with PHPMA was determined by a method previously described [16,29]. Adult ICA mice received various doses of free RNase or its polymer conjugates injected subcutaneously once a week for 5 weeks. Ten days after the last injection, the mice were sacrificed and their testes without epididymes were excised and histologically examined. Degenerative effects on the testes were assessed as described earlier [16]. Fifty to sixty tubules of the central part of the testes were watched microscopically. Body weight of mice was followed before and after the experiment. 2.6. Immunogenicity determination The immunogenicity of free and PHPMA-conjugated RNase A was determined as described previously [16]. A non-competitive ELISA test was performed. Micro titer plate wells were coated with 25 Ag of free RNase A or its PHPMA conjugate. After washing the plates, antisera from mice treated with the above mentioned ribonucleases and control sera from mice injected with PBS were serially diluted in wells and incubated at 37 jC for 2 h. The SwAM PX (Swine anti-mice IgG with peroxidase, USOL, Prague, Czech Republic) conjugate diluted 1:1000 was added, and following further 20 min of incubation with the substrate solution, the reaction was stopped with the addition of 4.0 N H2SO4. The solution was measured using photometry at 450 nm (Titertek Uniskan, Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK). Serum test results were defined as positive when the optical density of the serum tested was found to be at least 3 S.E.M.s higher than that of control mice. Antibody titers against free RNase A and its conjugates with HPMA were detected.

2.7. Embryotoxic effect Two-cell embryos were obtained from super-ovulated mice by flushing mouse oviducts 36 h after mating. Embryos were cultured with free or HPMA conjugated RNase A in CZB medium (81.62 mM NaCl, 4.83 mM KCl, 1.18 mM KH2PO4, 1.18 mM MgSO4Á7H2O, 25.12 mM NaHCO3, 1.7 mM CaCl2Á H2, 31.3 mM sodium lactate, 0.27 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.11 mM EDTA, 1 mM glutamine, 100 unit/ ml penicilin G sodium, 0.50 mg/ml streptomycin and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and the protein species to be tested for 72 ­92 h in a humidified atmosphere containing CO2 (5% v/v) at 37.5 jC. Controls were prepared as above, but without addition of protein species. The development stage of the embryos was monitored with stereomicroscope [17,29]. 2.8. Histology All animals were subjected to tumor enucleation, and these were consequently fixed in buffered formaldehyde (10%) for histology examination. Fixed samples of tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks. Tissue slides (6 Am) were cut and stained with hematoxilin ­ eosin (HE).

3. Results 3.1. Therapeutic effect of BS-RNase and RNase A conjugates on melanoma tumor growth In our previous studies [20,22,24], no or very negligible effect was seen with free RNase A and BS-RNase at the doses of 10 ­ 12 mg/kg when injected intravenously or intraperitoneally into athymic nude mice bearing various human tumors. Surprisingly, both of these enzymes conjugated covalently to polymer chains (PHPMA or PEG) exerted significant antitumor effectiveness in mice bearing melanoma tumor using much lower doses (from 0.5 to 2 mg/kg) [16,23,29]. However, the toxicity of both conjugated RNases also increased. While free BS-RNase was well tolerated at daily intravenous doses of more then 10 mg/kg, the daily doses of 5 mg/kg of its classic polymer conjugate (P-BS) or 2 mg/kg of its star-like polymer conjugate (S-BS) were already toxic as was demonstrated by the mortality and marked loss of mouse body weight [24]. On the contrary, RNase A covalently conjugated to polymer chains (classic and star-like PHPMA or PEG5 and PEG22) exerted significant reduction of melanoma tumor volume with lower symptoms of toxicity compared to that of BS-RNase

conjugates [16,23,29]. The dose-dependent effect of RNase A and BS-RNase conjugates with PHPMA chain on melanoma tumor is shown in Table 1. The efficiency of RNase A conjugates is quite comparable with that of BS-RNase conjugates, while their toxicity is markedly lower. It proves that the use of RNase A conjugates for tumor therapy might be more convenient.

3.2. Therapeutic effect of BS-RNase and RNase A conjugates on human neuroblastoma Human neuroblastoma cells (107) sustained in a culture were injected subcutaneously in the right flank of a mouse and the treatment started when the area of the transplanted tumor reached about 5 Â 5 mm. RNase preparations were administered daily, with breaks on weekends usually for 2 weeks. The effect of free BS-RNase, BS-RNase conjugate with classic polymer (P-BS) and RNase A conjugate with star-like polymer (S-RA) is shown in Fig. 1. S-RA (1 mg/kg) and P-BS (2.5 mg/kg) in eight doses decreased significantly ( P>0.01) the growth of neuroblastoma tumor in the course of 3 weeks, whereas free BSRNase at 10 times higher dose exerted only negligible and non-significant effect followed with toxic symptoms (decrease of mice body weight by 15%) (Fig. 2). The S-RA conjugate exerted better antitumor activity than P-BS even used at lower doses. Both tested preparations did not show any toxic side effects in mice. 3.3.

mentioned above, and also the schedule of treatment was the same as before. Compared to free BS-RNase and its polymer conjugates, RNase A and its conjugate (star S-RA and classic P-RA) were better tolerated by mice without marked toxic symptoms. In addition, free RNase A administered at the daily dose of 10 mg/kg exerted small therapeutic effect whereas its star polymer conjugate (S-RA) was highly effective (Fig. 3). The best effect was

do not exert any antiproliferative activity on ML-2 cells in vitro. This demonstrates that penetration of bulky polymer-RNase molecules into tumor cells is markedly reduced in an in vitro system and there is no difference in the antiproliferative activity between the BS-RNase and RNase A conjugates and between the star-shaped and classic polymer carriers. The inability of BS-RNase conjugate to internalize the tumor cell in vitro is also demonstrated in the next experiment. 3.6. Binding and uptake of BS-RNase and its HPMA conjugate

polymer P-BS (3 Â 106 cells/2.5 mg RNase/ml of RPMI medium) and incubated for 4 h in a CO2 incubator at 37 jC. Then 0.1 ml of this mixture was injected s.c. or i.p. into the mice C57/Bl/6. Prolonged mouse survival was tested during the following 2-month period compared to the control group injected with EL-4 cells pre-incubated only with medium. Both BS-RNase and its conjugate prolonged significantly the survival of mice. The subcutaneous administration (Fig. 5b) of the cell mixture was more effective than the intraperitoneal one ( Fig. 5a). It was of interest that the effect of free BSRNase did not markedly differ from that of its conjugated preparation, which suggests that conjugated BS-RNase might be internalized the same way as the free enzyme. The body weight of the mice did not markedly decrease during the experiment and also the shape of mice did not show any toxic symptoms. 3.5. Antiproliferative effect on ML-2 cells We previously demonstrated a potent antitumor activity of BS-RNase on various tumor cell lines, whereas its polymer conjugates or RNase A were ineffective [10,22,25]. The data in Fig. 6 have shown similarly that also conjugates of RNase A

Internalization of BS-RNase and its star-shape polymer conjugate (S-BS) was tested on ML-2 tumor cell line. The binding and uptake of 125I-labeled BSRNase preparations was estimated with increasing amounts of free and conjugated enzyme. As shown in Table 2, a significant dose-dependent radioactivity was detected in the pellet of cells treated with free BS-RNase, while only negligible radioactivity was found after incubation of cells with conjugated preparation S-BS. Addition of an excess of cold BS-RNase decreased significantly the uptake of labeled BS-RNase while the S-BS uptake was not influenced (unpublished data). The radioactivity remaining on cell surface, removed by high salt concentration, was in both cases very low and independent of concentration. This result indicates a very fast binding and uptake of free BS-RNase by tumor cells. The negligible uptake of S-BS is in accordance with its inefficiency on proliferation of ML-2 cells.

3.7. Aspermatogenic activity Subcutaneous injections of 100 Ag (RNase A equivalent) of all RNase A conjugates showed increased aspermatogenic activity of these species in comparison with free RNase A. This aspermatogenic effect of conjugated RNase A is almost the same as that observed after the injection of free BSRNase or 1000 Ag of free RNase A (Table 3). The body weight of mice injected with free RNase A and BS-RNase as with polymer-conjugated RNase A did not change markedly during the tested period. The immunogenicity determined as titer of antibodies increased very much against the free enzyme but decreased against the PHPMA-conjugated RNase A (Table 3).

4. Discussion The antitumor activity of various ribonucleases has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo and published in many papers [1,10 ­15,17 ­ 23,30]. Recently, the use of copolymers of PHPMA or PEG have gained importance in targetable drug carrier systems for the site-specific therapy. Considering that the activity of the modified protein remains preserved, and delivered in efficient form to the target cell, we prepared PHPMA and PEG conjugates with two bovine ribonucleases (BS-RNase and RNase A), and tested their antitumor activity. These RNases conjugated with the mentioned polymers demonstrated marked antitumor effect after intravenous administration in mice bearing three different human tumors, whereas they did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect in vitro on various tumor cell lines [16,23,29]. In our previous experiments [3,20] on human tumors transplanted into nude mice, BS-RNase was effective only when injected intratumorally and RNase A was not effective at all. One can assume that the conjugated RNases might accumulate in tumor due to the en-

hanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) as published by Maeda et al.[13]. In addition, we have proven that polymer-conjugated BS-RNase persists after 24 h at a high level in blood stream of mice, whereas the free form of BS-RNase is very quickly eliminated [23]. This finding was consistent with the report of Tarnowski et al. [27] who announced that injected RNase A disappears from blood in a few minutes. One could conclude that conjunction with PHPMA or PEG might not only be capable to prevent RNase, circulating in blood, from proteolytic degradation, but could also prevent it from binding to the ribonuclease inhibitor (RI). It was also reported that the maintenance of the catalytic activity is essential for the biologic activity of BS-RNase [9]. We have proven that modification of BS-RNase with PHPMA does not affect its catalytic activity and results in a dramatic increase of its resistance to proteolytic attack [18,29]. Previous studies [2,4,10,14] have shown that there is a correlation between dimeric structure and biologic action of BS-RNase and/or its ability to escape the effect of the RI. Based on these studies, it seems that under in vitro conditions, the dimeric structure of an RNase plays an essential role in the process underlying the escape of an RNase from the interaction with RI [10,12,19,25]. On the contrary, the results presented here or reported recently [12,16, 25,29] with polymer-conjugated RNases injected into mice bearing tumors did not prove this assumption. Monomeric RNase A conjugated to polymer carriers exerted the same antitumor activity as the conjugate of dimeric BS-RNase. The efficiency of monomeric RNases was also proved by other authors who reported high antitumor effectiveness of a monomeric RNase, onconase [30] or monomeric human pancreatic RNase conjugated with transferrin whose cytotoxicity to U251 tumor cells is 5000 times greater than that of the recombinant wild-type hRNase [26]. Our experiments with EL-4 cells were performed to bring better knowledge about the difference between in vitro and in vivo effects of conjugates. Whereas the conjugated BS-RNase was not effective in vitro, EL-4 cells pre-incubated with conjugated BS-RNase and administered into mice exhibited a prolongation of their survival time compared to that measured in control animal injected with non-treated cells. This result showed that there must exist another pathway for internalization of conjugated RNases under in vivo

condition which does not occur in in vitro systems. The results presented here and in our previous publications [16,23,24,29] suggest the possibility of several mechanisms of action of PHPMA and PEG conjugated RNases. The polymers protect the monomeric RNase A against the action of RI and potentially increase its cytotoxic activity. Polymers prolong significantly the life time of RNases in blood stream and enable them to reach the site of action in target cell [23]. After conjugation, the catalytic activity of RNase remains preserved with a dramatic increase of its resistance to proteolytic digestion [18]. PEG-conjugated RNases bind less efficiently antibodies directed against them, and their spermatogenicity, embryotoxicity and toxicity in mice decrease [16].
