Lampreys carry different skin receptors, including presumed mechanoreceptors called neuromasts, Merkel cells, and free nerve endings [for a review, see R. C. Lethbridge and I. C. Potter, in The Biology of Lampreys, M. W. Hardisty and I. C. Potter, Eds. (Academic Press, New York, 1982), vol. 3, pp. 377­ 449; and C. M. Rovainen, in The Biology of Lampreys, M. W. Hardisty and I. C. Potter, Eds. (Academic Press, New York, 1982), pp. 1­136]. The main neural pathways that convey stimulation originating at the skin to the central nervous system are the dorsal roots of the spinal cord and the trigeminal nerves. Afferent fibers of the dorsal roots in lampreys have their cell bodies either within the spinal cord (dorsal cells) or in dorsal root ganglia. Anatomical and electrophysiological studies have shown that dorsal column afferent fibers carrying somatosensory information from the body ascend to the brainstem of lampreys (5, 20). Dorsal column fibers project disynaptically via a brainstem relay to RS neurons. Trigeminal sensory afferents carrying cutaneous inputs from the head region travel also within the lateral part of the rhombencephalon [H. Koyama, R. Kishida, R. C. Goris, T. Kusunoki, J. Comp. Neurol. 264, 437 (1987)]. Stimulation of the ipsi- or contralateral trigeminal nerve produces a mixed excitatoryinhibitory synaptic response in RS neurons (6) [W. O. Wickelgren, J. Physiol. (London) 270, 89 (1977); C. M. Rovainen, J. Neurophysiol. 30, 1000 (1967)]. Upon mechanical stimulation of the skin, we observed mostly excitatory PSPs (n 57) and rarely predominant inhibitory PSPs (n 3). Cutaneous inputs to RS neurons have also been described in cats [ T. Drew, T. Cabana, S. Rossignol, Exp. Brain Res. 111, 153 (1996); B. W. Peterson and L. P. Felpel, Brain Res. 27, 373 (1971); M. Shimamura and I. Kogure, ibid. 230, 27 (1983)]. 9. J. T. Buchanan, L. Brodin, N. Dale, S. Grillner, Brain Res. 408, 321 (1987); Y. Ohta and S. Grillner, J. Neurophysiol. 62, 1079 (1989). 10. Experiments (n 28) were performed on larval and young adult lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) anesthetized with tricaine methanesulfonate (100 mg/liter; Aldrich). All surgical and experimental procedures conformed to the Canadian Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines and were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee. The animal was completely transected below the gill. The brain and rostral segments of the spinal cord were dissected with the notochord and underlying cranium. The preparation was pinned down at the bottom of a recording chamber. Perfusion with oxygenated cold Ringer's solution (pH 7.4) was maintained throughout the experiment. All brain tissue rostral to the diencephalon was removed, making the preparation a decerebrate one. The skin covering the snout was kept for mechanical stimulation with a glass rod (diameter, 0.5 mm) attached to a strain gauge. The stimulation was performed either manually or by a computer-controlled step motor. The trigeminal nerves were exposed for electrical stimulation with glass-coated tungsten microelectrodes (2 to 4 megohm). RS cells were impaled with sharp glass micropipettes filled with 4 M potassium acetate (100 megohm). Local application of drugs was done with a Picospritzer. 11. The semi-intact preparation (n 11) was similar, but the caudal two-thirds of the body was left freely moving behind the dissected brainstem and rostral spinal cord. Teflon-coated stainless steel microwires (50 m in diameter) were inserted into the muscle for EMG recording. 12. Trigeminal inputs to RS neurons in lampreys are mediated by excitatory and inhibitory amino acids (6, 20). 13. Consistent with this observation, we recently recorded NMDA-induced plateau potentials, which are resistant to tetrodotoxin, in RS neurons. 14. Reticulospinal neurons were retrogradely labeled in vitro for 24 to 48 hours by placement of Calcium Green­Dextran (10,000 MW; Molecular Probes) on the rostral end of the sectioned spinal cord at the 1­2 segment level. Labeled cells were imaged on a Nikon epifluorescent microscope and recorded with an intensified charge-coupled device camera at a rate of one to two images per second. Calcium responses are expressed as relative changes in fluorescence ( F/F %). M. J. O'Donovan, S. Ho, G. Sholomenko, W. Yee, J. Neurosci. Methods 46, 91 (1993); A. D. McClellan, D. McPherson, M. J.

Structural Plasticity in a Remodeled Protein-Protein Interface
Shane Atwell, Mark Ultsch, Abraham M. De Vos, James A. Wells*
Remodeling of the interface between human growth hormone (hGH) and the extracellular domain of its receptor was studied by deleting a critical tryptophan residue (at position 104) in the receptor, creating a large cavity, and selecting a pentamutant of hGH by phage display that fills the cavity and largely restores binding affinity. A 2.1 Å resolution x-ray structure of the mutant complex showed that the receptor cavity was filled by selected hydrophobic mutations of hGH. Large structural rearrangements occurred in the interface at sites that were distant from the mutations. Such plasticity may be a means for protein-protein interfaces to adapt to mutations as they coevolve.

Protein-protein interfaces are usually large
and elaborate, consisting of 10 to 40 contact side chains, each of which interdigitates with several others across the interface (1). The contact side chains are often presented from discontinuous segments of each polypeptide chain. Given the complexities of these interactions, we wondered how a functionally disruptive mutation on one side of the interface could be complementS. Atwell and J. A.

ed by mutations in its binding partner. This is a challenge that nature faces as protein complexes coevolve. We studied this problem by phage display using the high-affinity interface between hGH and the extracellular domain of its receptor (hGHbp), members of a cytokine-receptor superfamily (2). The hormone and receptor initially form a tight 1:1 0.3 complex (dissociation constant Kd nM), and the x-ray structure of this complex is known to high resolution (3). There are about 30 contact side chains on each side of this interface, but alanine-scanning mutagenesis has shown that only a small set of primarily hydrophobic contacts at the center of the interface dominate affinity (4, 5).

tor includes a tryptophan residue at position 104 (W104) (6) that inserts into a groove in hGH (Fig. 1). When W104 is mutated to alanine (W104A), the binding affinity decreases by a factor of 2500 (5). We isolated a variant of hGH that could bind to the mutant W104A-hGHbp and determined the x-ray structure of the complex to see how the interface adapted. To isolate a mutant of hGH that could bind to W104A-hGHbp, we randomly mutated hGH at five residues (K168, D171, K172, T175, and F176) that pack against W104 (Fig. 1A). A pool of hGH mutants,

Table 1. Crystallographic statistics for the complex between A1-hGH and W104A-hGHbp. The 2.1 Å data were collected from flash-frozen crystals at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) with an Area Detector Systems Corporation charge-coupled device detector positioned at 175 cm with the direct beam in the corner, and data were reduced with DENZO and SCALEPACK (20). Solution of the structure was done by molecular replacement with coordinates from the 2.6 Å resolution 1:1 complex structure (3). The initial refinement was done in X-PLOR (21) and completed by using maximum likelihood in the Refmac package of the CCP4 suite (22). No cutoff was used. The final model includes the ordered residues for A1-hGH (residues 3 to 48, 51 to 129, 136 to 148, and 155 to 191) in complex with W104A-hGHbp (residues 32 to 52, 61 to 72, 79 to 236).

containing 107 independent sequences, was displayed on filamentous phagemid particles (7) and selected for binding to immobilized W104A-hGHbp (8). After seven rounds of binding selection, clones were sequenced and screened for binding to W104A-hGHbp. The most frequently isolated clone, called A1-hGH, was the only one found to bind detectably to W104AhGHbp in a screening assay (9). This variant contained five mutations (K168R, D171T, K172Y, E174A, and F176Y). One of these, E174A, was not encoded by the mutagenic oligonucleotide. Such spurious mutations usually have a strong selective advantage (10). Three of the selected residues (D171T, E174A, and F176Y) were similar to previously selected variants of hGH (D171S, E174S, and F176Y) that bound more tightly to wild-type hGHbp (11). The affinity for binding of the A1-hGH variant to W104A-hGHbp (12) was dramatically improved by the five mutations (Kd 14 nM), as compared with wild-type hGH binding to W104A-hGHbp (Kd 1000 nM). To identify the mutations in A1-hGH that most affected binding, we reverted each to their wild-type counterpart and measured their binding affinities to W104A-hGHbp (12). The arginine selected at position 168 and the tyrosine selected at position 176 made only minor contributions to affinity: their reversion back to lysine and phenylalanine, respectively, only reduced affinity up to twofold from the A1 varint (Kd 33 nM and 21 nM, respectively). However, each of the other three selected mutations (D171T, K172Y, and E174A) caused 15 to 300-fold reductions in affinity when reverted to their wild-type 5000 nM, 200 nM, and 400 residue (Kd nM, respectively). A1-hGH bound much

more weakly to the wild-type hGHbp (Kd 1 M), showing it to be highly specific for the W104A-hGHbp mutant (9). To understand the structural basis for these functional effects, we determined the x-ray structure of the complex between A1hGH and W104A-hGHbp (13). The crystals were isomorphous with the wild-type 1:1 complex (3) and diffracted to 2.1 Å (Table 1), the highest resolution yet obtained for any hGH:hGHbp complex. The structure shows that the 150 Å3 hole in W104A-hGHbp is filled by the phenolic group of the critical K172Y mutation of A1-hGH (Fig. 1B); in addition, the I103 side chain in W104-hGHbp rotates around to place its isobutyl side chain in the cavity. This rotation allows a shift of the D126 side chain of W104A-hGHbp, which breaks a hydrogen bond to the main chain at position 104 to form a salt bridge with R43 (Fig. 1B). The movement of D126 is probably coupled to the critical D171T change in A1-hGH, because retention of aspartate at position 171 would cause electrostatic repulsion at D126 of W104A-hGHbp (Fig. 1). Indeed, the binding affinity of a T171A mutation is reduced twofold compared 27 nM), consistent with A1-hGH (Kd with the preference for a neutral residue over Asp at position 171 for binding to W104A-hGHbp. The E174A mutation in hGH induces another set of concerted changes (Fig. 1B). In the wild-type complex, E174 makes two hydrogen bonds: one to H18 of hGH and the other to N218 of hGHbp. When E174 is mutated to Ala, H18 rotates to avoid clashing with N218, which allows the hormone and receptor to move closer together (Fig. 1B). The other two selected residues (K168R and F176Y) do not make new contacts with hGHbp, consistent with their

having little effect on binding when reverted back to their wild-type residues. Overall, the combination of mutations with conformational changes nearly fill the 150 Å3 cavity introduced by the W104A mutation. A hole of about 20 Å3 is left between Y172 and Y176 of the hormone and I103 of hGHbp; a hole of about 40 Å3 is created by the movement of the K168R side chain of hGH. These small cavities, which are not seen filled with ordered solvent, may be disruptive to affinity by analogy to destabilizing mutations in T4 lysozyme (14); these cavities may account for the reduced affinity of the complex of A1-hGH with W104A14 hGHbp relative to the wild-type (Kd nM compared with 0.3 nM, respectively). Remarkably, the local structural changes near the site of the W104A mutation induce substantial global changes that affect the entire interface. The five mutations allow the hormone to move closer to hGHbp in the vicinity of the W104A mutation, with the C of K168 1.1 Å closer to the C of W104A. This movement is accompanied by a 5° rotation of A1-hGH relative to the receptor. A1-hGH slides across the receptor, pivoting at a point near G168 of hGHbp. The global changes that radiate outward from the pivot point necessitate substantial rearrangement in both main-chain and side-chain contacts throughout the interface. Some of the main-chain and side-chain van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding groups that are 15 Å from the epicenter of these mutations move by up to 3 Å relative to their neighbors in wild-type hGHbp (Fig. 2A). As a result, four hydrogen bonds are lost and three new ones are gained between unchanged atoms in the mutant complex (Fig. 3). For example, the 3 Å salt bridge between K41 and E127 in the wild-type complex, which is 11 Å from the -carbon of W104, has moved apart by 2.4 Å in the mutant complex (Fig.
Fig. 3. Two views (A and B) of nonmutated contact residues that change salt bridge partners in the A1hGH and W104A-hGHbp complex (right) relative to the wild-type complex (left). Hormone residues are in blue, and receptor residues are in pink, except for position 104 which is in orange.

3A). This gap is filled by two ordered waters, one of which mediates interactions between this charged pair. The salt bridge in the wild-type complex between R64 and D164, 17 Å from W104, is replaced by one between R64 and E44 in the mutant complex with commensurate changes in ordered waters (Fig. 3B). In contrast, large domain movements and detailed changes in the interface were not seen in another mutant complex in which three functionally inert residues in hGH (F25, Y42, and Q46) were simultaneously mutated to alanine (15). These mutations, which are near the periphery of the interface, induced only small movements near the sites of mutation (Fig. 2B); two hydrogen bonds were lost and none were gained. The structures and binding regions for a number of hematopoietic cytokines and their receptors are now known (2, 16). One of the notable features is that although the same general regions of the hormone and receptor are involved in binding, the exact nature of the contacts is very different. For example, W104 of hGHbp is conserved in only a few of the cytokine receptors, partic-

ularly the prolactin receptor, which shares 30% sequence identity with hGHbp and also binds hGH. Interestingly, the structure of the complex between hGH and the prolactin receptor also shows substantial differences in domain orientation compared with hGHbp (16). These studies reveal how large, functional changes can be rescued by a limited number of mutations. The mutations were accommodated by remarkably large movements in unaltered side-chain and mainchain contacts throughout the interface. Structural changes induced by mutations have been seen in x-ray structures of single-domain proteins; for example, when core residues were mutated (17) or when surface residues were inserted or deleted in helices of T4 lysozyme (18) or staphylococcal nuclease (19). Here, it is striking that such large changes are observed over a large interface in a bimolecular protein complex, requiring coordinated changes in both components, and that they involve very specific interactions such as hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. These results suggest that structural plasticity is nascent in protein-protein interfaces and provides a

A1-hGH and the single-site revertants were constructed by mutagenizing pB0720, a G120R-hGH expression plasmid (7 ). These were expressed as soluble proteins [C. N. Chang, M. Rey, B. Bochner, H. Heyneker, G. Gray, Gene 55, 189 (1987)] in the strain 34B8, a nonsuppressor strain of Escherichia coli. Each mutant was isolated from a 50-ml culture in 250-ml shake flasks by pelleting the cells and freezing them at ­20°C overnight. Cells were thawed and osmotically shocked in 10 mM tris (pH 8.0). The concentration of hormone was determined by densitometry of Coomassie blue­stained gels (4). Initial characterization of binding was measured on a BIAcore instrument by coupling W104A-hGHbp through lysine residues to 2500 resonance units [(4); B. Johnsson, S. Lofas, G. Lindquist, Anal. Biochem. 198, 268 (1991)]. Radioimmunoassay was performed for binding of hGH variants to hGHbp or W104A-hGHbp as described [S. A. Spencer et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7862 (1988)]. In the case of wild-type hGHbp, 125I-labeled hGH was used as competitor; for W104A-hGHbp, an affinity-optimized variant of hGH (11) labeled with 125I was used. This variant bound with an affinity of 1.6 ( 0.7) nM to

W104A-hGHbp. Standard errors in the Kd measurements ranged from 30 to 50% of the value indicated in the text and were higher near the detection limits of the assay ( 1 M). We purified A1-hGH and W104A-hGHbp from an E. coli fermentation culture using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction columns. The two proteins were combined and purified as a complex on a gel filtration column. Crystals were induced by streak seeding with crystals of the F25A, Y42A, Q46AhGH:hGHbp complex (15) ( 5 mg/ml) in 50 mM bis-tris (pH 6.5) and 17 to 20% saturated ammonium sulfate. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. A. E. Ericksson et al., Science 255, 178 (1992); A. E. Ericksson, W. A. Baase, B. W. Matthews, J. Mol. Biol. 229, 747 (1993). K. H.

Cleland and Kreevoy recently advanced the idea that a special type of hydrogen bond (H-bond), termed a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB), may account for the "missing" transition state stabilization underlying the catalytic power of many enzymes, and Frey et al. have proposed that the H-bond between aspartic acid 102 and histidine 57 in the catalytic triad of serine proteases is an example of a catalytically important LBHB. Experimental facts are here considered regarding the aspartic acid­ histidine and cis­ urocanic H-bonds that are inconsistent with fundamental tenets of the LBHB hypothesis. The inconsistencies between theory and experiment in these paradigm systems cast doubt on the existence of LBHBs, as currently defined, within enzyme active sites.

The H-bond inherently involves the sharing of hydrogen atoms to varying extents with other atoms (1). This sharing is often depicted as a chemical equilibration or resonance hybridization of structures such as 1 and 2 (Eq. 1). Proton sharing can also be depicted as a lengthening of the A-H bond of the donor, 1, as if the proton were in an intermediate stage of transfer to B (2). In conventional H-bonds the H atom is associated more with one heteroatom than the other.

LBHBs are distinguished from convenE. L. Ash, J. L. Sudmeier, W. W. Bachovchin, Department of Biochemistry, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, USA. E. C.

tional H-bonds by equal proton sharing between the heteroatoms. LBHBs can be double-welled, depicted as 1 and 2 contributing equally to the system; or single-welled, depicted as a single structure with the proton residing at a point equidistant between A and B, as in 3 (Eq. 1). LBHBs were first observed in the gas phase (1, 3), where evidence for their existence and strength is persuasive. Schowen first proposed that LBHBs may exist within the protected interior of proteins (4). Promotion of this idea by Cleland and Kreevoy (5) and Frey et al. (6) has led to its substantial (7), though not universal (8), acceptance. Physicochemical parameters used to identify LBHBs include (i) extreme low-field 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts [ 16 parts per million (ppm)]; (ii) deuterium isotope effects on low-field 1H resonances; (iii) low ( 1.0) isotopic fractionation factors; and (iv) deuterium isotope effects on infrared and Raman frequencies (1)--the most unambiguous of
