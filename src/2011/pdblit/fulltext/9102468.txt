The enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) has been isolated from a mutant strain of Salmonella tgphimurium, constructed by Kustu, which lacks the enzymatic activity for adenylylation of glutamine synthetase. Thus the purified GS is uniformly unadenylylated, as confirmed by gel electrophoresis and enzyme assays. It crystallizes readily in many morphologies, at least six of which are distinct polymorphs. The most favorable crystal form for structural studies belongs to space group C2, with unit cell dimensions a = 235.5 A, b = 134.5 A, c = 200.1 A, /3 = 102.8", and with one GS molecule per asymmetric unit. The crystals diffract to about 2.8 A resolution in rotation X-ray photographs and thus appear suitable for structural studies at moderate resolution. These crystals are isomorphous with crystalline GS from Escherichia coli in both adenylylated and unadenylylated states, suggesting that the enzymes from the two bacteria are similar molecules, and that adenylylation does not greatly affect the conformation of the molecule.

In the nitrogen metabolism of bacteria, glutamine synthetase plays a central role; it catalyzes one of the main reactions by which ammonia is assimilated: &fez+ L-glutamate + NH3 + ATP e L-glutamine + ADP + Pi. Numerous end products of glutamine metabolism bind to, and are enzymatic effectors of, GS2 as found by Woolfolk and Stadtman (1). GS activity is also modulated by divalent cations. Moreover, the activity of GS is regulated by covalent modification of a specific tyrosyl residue by an AMP moiety (2-4).

This latter modification, termed adenylylation, has complicated X-ray diffraction studies of Escherichia coli GS. Partially adenylylated GS may crystallize in either monoclinic space group C2 or triclinic space group Pl under identical conditions (5,6). These two crystal forms frequently are found intermingled in the same droplet. Their morphologies are quite similar, and their diffraction patterns can be distinguished only by careful comparison. For this reason, we set out to isolate and to crystallize GS which is completely unadenylylated. Initially we attempted to isolate unadenylylated GS both by regulating the growth conditions of E. coli and by treating isolated enzyme with phosphodiesterase to remove the AMP moiety. Neither method was completely successful. Subsequently, Dr. S. Kustu provided us with a mutant strain of Salmonellu typhi512

METHODS

Enzyme isolation The enzyme purification was based on previous procedures (8-10). A slant of S. typhimurium, strain SK708 (hisF645 glnE122), was kindly provided by Dr. S. Kustu of the University of California, Davis. Cells were grown in a 166-liter culture in a New Brunswick IF250 fermentor, on a medium consisting of 0.2 mM histidine, 7 mM glutamine, 15 mM KHzPOI, 23 mM K,HPO,*3H,O, 7 mM Na$04,

0.9 mM MgSOl * 7HzO,28 mM glucose, and trace metals at pH 7.1. Immediately after harvesting, the cells (890 g wet wt) were opened by two passes through a French pressure cell, at a pressure of 8000 psi. The variations from the published isolation (10) were as follows. In step 3, 45% saturated (at 4°C) ammonium sulfate was used for enzyme precipitation, and the suspension was stirred for 8-12 h at pH 7.1. In step 4 the enzyme solution was heated to 58-6O'C. Again in step 5, 45% saturated ammonium sulfate was used, and the pH adjusted to neutrality before stirring. In step 7 the ammonium sulfate was 20% saturated, rather than 10%. The final purification step involves affinity chromatography on an Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) column. A 3 X 5-cm column was equilibrated with 0.9 M NaCl,

All these crystallizations were done at 4°C; method (c) gave the same results at 21°C. 4. 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and spermine. To 10 ~1 of GS in 15 mM imidazole, pH 7.1, and 2.2 mM MnCl, was added 10 pl of O-2 mM MPD with 1 or 2 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride, to form a drop on a cover slip. The coverslip was inverted over a reservoir of 5% MPD. 5. PEG 6000, sodium chloride, and spermine. As in 4 above, 10 ~1 of GS solution was mixed on a coverslip with a solution of 10% PEG 6000, 1 M NaCl, and 1 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride, and the coverslip was inverted over a reservoir of 10% PEG 6000 and 1 M NaCl.

and the protein solution containing 0.9 M NaCl was loaded in two batches. The column was washed with 100 ml of 0.9 M NaCl and GS was eluted with 0.9 M NaCl containing 10 mM NaADP. The enzyme was assayed by the y-glutamyl hydroxamate method (10). The pooled enzyme fractions were dialyzed 3 days against 50 mM imidazole (pH `7) containing 10 rnr.i MnClz and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol or against 5 mrd imidazole (pH 7.1) containing 0.2 mM MnClr and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. Other methods. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run by the method of Laemmli (11) to assess purity, as well as the state of adenylylation of GS (12). Protein concentration was measured by the procedure of Lowry (13) and enzyme assays were done following the procedures of Stadtman et al. (14). X-ray crystallographic experiments were carried out as described previously (5), except that rotation photographs were taken with graphite-monochromatized radiation. Electron microscopy, using negative staining with 1% uranyl acetate, was carried out both at UCLA, by Mr. Steve Eshita and Dr. James A. Lake, and at the FritzHaber-Institut, Berlin, by Dr. W. Kunath, Mr. K. Weiss, and Dr. Martin Kessel. Crystdlization A survey of many crystallizing conditions was carried out virtually as described before (5). by the hanging-drop method of vapor diffusion, using drops of 20 pl and reservoirs of 1.5 ml, all solutions used in the drops having been millipore filtered prior to use. Unless noted otherwise in the following, all crystallizations were at 21°C. Further details of the five most successful crystallizing methods are as follows: 1. Crystallizations with 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). A lo-p1 aliquot of dialyzed GS solution (50 mM imidazole, pH `7, 10 mM MnClr, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol) was mixed on a coverslip with 10 ~1 of reservoir solution. The coverslip was immediately inverted over a reservoir containing 13-15% MPD (v/v). 2. Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG). As in 1 above, a lo-r1 aliquot of GS solution was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution and placed over a reservoir of 2-8% (w/v) PEG. 3. PEG 6000 with various salts. As in 1 and 2 above, the hanging drop was prepared by mixing equal volumes of GS and reservoir solutions, but the reservoir solution contained salts in addition to PEG 6000, as suggested by Collier et al (15). Solutions were made by mixing a given volume percent salt solution or a solution saturated in water at 21°C with a PEG 6000 solution of a given weight percent. The following reservoir solutions were used: (a) 20% PEG 6000 with 2 M NaCl and 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4; (b) 18% PEG 6000 and 9% saturated ammonium sulfate; (c) 12-26% PEG 6000 and 12-24% saturated sodium sulfate; (d) 16-1896 PEG 6000 and 12% saturated sodium

Formation of heavy atom odducta A few grains of Nb&li4 were added to crystals in a 20-~1 hanging drop of synthetic mother liquor (15 mM imidazole, pH `7, 3 mM MnCl,, 1 mM spermine, and 5% MPD). For other heavy atoms in Table II, weighed quantities were dissolved in water and used to make the above synthetic mother liquor containing the desired concentration to 20 ~1 of of heavy atom. Crystals were transferred this solution. After 3-20 h, the crystals were mounted in capillaries for X-ray diffraction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Isolation and properties of GS. From a typical 166-liter fermentation, 500 mg of GS was isolated, having a specific activity of 50 pmol/min/mg in the y-glutamyl hydroxamate assay at pH 7.57 and 25" (14). In electron micrographs, negatively stained molecules of GS from S. typhimurium (Fig. 1) appear essentially identical to dodecameric GS from E. coli (16, 17) in which the 12 subunits appear to be arranged as the carbon atoms of two eclipsed benzene rings, face to face. On SDS gels (Fig. 2), the electrophoretic

mobility of the mutant GS from S. typhimwrium appears nearly identical to that of GS from wild-type S. typhimurium and GS from E. co&, except that the GS from mutant cells runs as a single band, in contrast to the other two GS samples which reveal a fainter, second band with slightly lower mobility. This second band is characteristic of GS subunits that are adenylylated, whereas the band of higher mobility is characteristic of unadenylylated GS subunits (12). Thus GS isolated from the mutant 5! typhimurium cells appears by the criterion of gel electrophoresis to be unadenylylated, as expected from the work of Kustu (`7). Further evidence that the GS isolated from the mutant is unadenylylated comes from enzyme assays in mixed imidazole buffer (14). The pH optimum of the enzyme y-glutamyltransferase activity is dependent upon both the adenylylation state and the divalent cation present; in the presence of 0.3 mM MnClz an adenylylation state of 12 gives a pH optimum of 6.9 while an adI

enylylation state of 1.2 gives an optimum at pH 8.1. In 0.3 mM MnCl, plus 60 mM MgClz the pH optimum shifts to 7.4 for an adenylylation state of 0.0. With the mutant Salmonella enzyme the pH optimum with 0.4 mM MnClz was 8.0, changing to 7.3 with the addition of 60 mM MgClz (data not shown). Thus, the adenylylation state of the mutant enzyme is low. Crystals. The crystallization survey yielded a variety of crystalline habits. Of the many types we observed, we characterized the larger and more abundant crystals by X-ray diffraction, and a summary of results is given in Table I. Among methods that yielded the crystallization crystals too small or too unstable to characterize by X-ray diffraction are the following: form III (sheets and needles from

method 3a), forms IV and VII (octahedra and rods from 3c), form V (plates from method 3d), form VI (rods from 3b), form VIII (from 3e), form IX (from 3f), form X (octahedra from 3g), form XI (from 3h), and form XII (from 3i). Of the six crystalline forms examined by X-ray diffraction, the one called form XIV appears the most suitable for structural studies. It grows reproducibly to moderate size (0.4 X 0.4 X 0.25 mm), and the better crystals diffract to about 2.8 A resolution on rotation X-ray photographs (Fig. 3). This crystal form is isomorphous with crystal form III of GS from E. coli (6). Not only are the space group and unit cell dimensions the same, but the intensity distribution appears extremely similar on h01, hk0, and Ok1 precession photographs.

This isomorphism of the crystal of GS from the mutant S. typhimurium with that from E. coli in both the adenylylated and unadenylylated states indicates that the S. typhimurium GS molecule is similar in structure to GS from E. coli in both states. Two other aspects of crystal form XIV deserve mention. The first is that we have not observed among these crystals the mixture of C2 and Pl polymorphs that we found for the corresponding crystal from E. coli (6). We had speculated that the mixed polymorph from E. coli was related to adenylylation, and the present work seems to bear this out. The second point is that spermine seems essential for crystals to form, as though it bridges negatively charged sites on adjacent molecules in the crystals, diminishing repulsion. Similarly, we found that spermine promotes growth of the corresponding crystal from E. coli. Spermine has been reported to cause spectral changes in GS (4, 18). Form XVII is unusual for its long c-axial length of 1165 A. The packing must approximate that in which 12 molecules per unit cell stack face-to-face on top of each other, with their sixfold molecular axes almost parallel to the c-axis. This arrangement of GS molecules is similar to that seen in the helical cables reported by Frey et al. (17). Heavy atom adducts. The formation of heavy atom adducts by the crystals is sum-

marized in Table II. The rare earth compounds produce significant changes in intensities of diffraction, but also sometimes change the space group at longer soaking times. Fortunately both Nb&& and K2PtC14 produce large intensity changes and do not otherwise affect the crystals. The Nb salt results in deep yellow crystals as well.
CONCLUSIONS

The form XIV crystals of GS from S. typhimurium appear to be suitable for structural studies at moderate resolution from the aspects of (i) reproducibility of crystal growth; (ii) size of crystals; (iii) resolution and spacing of the diffraction spots; and (iv) the possibility of preparing the heavy atom adducts required for phase determination by the method of isomorphous replacement. The isomorphism of these crystals with those of E. coli GS in both adenylylated and unadenylylated states indicates that the enzymes from the two bacteria are similar, and that adenylylation does not cause large conformational changes.
