Structural Mechanism of Endosome Docking by the FYVE Domain
Tatiana Kutateladze* and Michael Overduin
The recruitment of trafficking and signaling proteins to membranes containing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] is mediated by FYVE domains. Here, the solution structure of the FYVE domain of the early endosome antigen 1 protein (EEA1) in the free state was compared with the structures of the domain complexed with PtdIns(3)P and mixed micelles. The multistep binding mechanism involved nonspecific insertion of a hydrophobic loop into the lipid bilayer, positioning and activating the binding pocket. Ligation of PtdIns(3)P then induced a global structural change, drawing the protein termini over the bound phosphoinositide by extension of a hinge. Specific recognition of the 3-phosphate was determined indirectly and directly by two clusters of conserved arginines. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases direct membrane trafficking and signaling by the regulated production of PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The monophosphorylated product is the most abundant because of its universal and constitutive expression in eukaryotic cells [reviewed in (1)]. PtdIns(3)P is recognized by the FYVE domain (2­ 4), which is named for its identification in the Fab1p, YOTB, Vac1p, and EEA1 proteins (5). Mammalian EEA1 fuses endosomes and relies on its FYVE domain for specific localization to PtdIns(3)P-enriched membranes and for recruiting regulatory Rab5 (6, 7) and syntaxin proteins (8, 9). However, the mechanism of membrane docking by the FYVE domain remains unclear. Crystal structures of the lipid-free FYVE domains of yeast Vps27p (10) and fruit fly Hrs (11) suggest different models for PtdIns(3)P recognition. To better understand the mechanism of endosome targeting, we solved the structures of the FYVE domain of human EEA1 in the PtdIns(3)Pbound and phospholipid-free states (12) ( Table 1) and defined the interactions in the specific complex with PtdIns(3)P-enriched micelles, a nonspecific dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelle complex, and aspecific complexes with PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns. The fold of the FYVE domain in the free state was similar to its fold when bound to phosphoinositides or micelles (Fig. 1). The antiparallel sheet formed by the 1 and 2 strands was the central structural element and played a crucial role in PtdIns(3)P binding. The second sheet formed an

elongated extension that packed against Phe1405 and Leu1408 in the COOH-terminal helix. Two zinc-binding clusters lay beneath and structured the PtdIns(3)P binding site; the first cluster also anchored the exposed hydrophobic Phe1364-Ser-Val-ThrVal1368 loop and mobile NH2-terminus. PtdIns(3)P was bound through a network of electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding,

and hydrophobic interactions. The binding pocket for the inositol head group was defined by basic clusters at either end of the 1 strand, one proximal (Arg1369 and Arg1370) and the other distal (Arg1374 and Arg1399) to the exposed hydrophobic loop. The PtdIns(3)P molecule inserted parallel to 1, as judged by nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) observed between the 4 and 5 positions of the inositol ring and Arg1370, His1372, and Ile1379 (Fig. 2). The 1- and 3-phosphates were ligated by the proximal Arg1369 HN and Arg1370 HN groups and by the distal Arg1374 HN and HN groups, respectively, as reflected by changes induced in their resonances (Fig. 3A). The arginine resonance perturbations were reciprocated by comparable changes in the 31P chemical shifts of the 1- and 3-phosphate groups (Fig. 3, B and C). The electrostatic nature of the interaction was emphasized by the FYVE domain's surface potential, with the most acute chemical shift changes occurring in the side chains that line the basic concave surface centered about the 1 strand (Fig. 4, A and B). Specificity for PtdIns(3)P involved indirect recognition. Within mammalian cells, FYVE domains select PtdIns(3)P over other phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(5)P, its structurally most similar biological com-

petitor. In fact, PtdIns(5)P did bind weakly to the EEA1 FYVE domain, inducing small but important chemical shift changes that paralleled the changes induced by PtdIns(3)P in the distal cluster (13). However, the arginine resonances in the proximal cluster were practically unaltered by PtdIns(5)P. Thus, we infer that the 5-phosphate could satisfy the distal cluster that normally ligates the 3-phosphate, whereas the 1-phosphate could not be accommodated by the proximal cluster. Consequently, specificity for PtdIns(3)P was determined indirectly by exclusion of the 1-phosphate of PtdIns(5)P, rather than by the inability of the 5-phosphate to mimic the 3-phosphate. Direct recognition of the 3-phosphate was also essential, because PtdIns, which lacks the 3-phosphate group, did not bind at all. Global conformational changes were induced by PtdIns(3)P ligation. The 10 residues preceding the membrane insertion loop constituted the most disordered region of the unligated domain. However, upon interaction with PtdIns(3)P, this region became more constrained and moved toward the binding pocket (Fig. 1D). In particular, the NH2-terminal Trp1348 and Ala1349 side chains exhibited new NOE contacts to binding-site residues including His1372, Arg1374, Gly1377, Asn1378, and Ile1379. This motion hinged on the Glu1353-Val-Gln1355 residues, which became more extended in the complex, displaying large changes in their backbone resonances and dihedral angles. Moreover, a similar motion of this element was induced by PtdIns(5)P (13), suggesting that distal cluster occupancy was sufficient to engage the NH2-terminus.

The H2N resonances of the Arg1370 and Arg1374 become resolved only in the presence of PtdIns(3)P (upper panel), indicating that the guanidino group rotation is impeded by PtdIns(3)P coordination.

The second sheet also shifted closer to PtdIns(3)P, and as a result of tighter packing in the distal cluster, new NOEs appeared between Arg1374, Arg1399 and neighboring residues near the basic cluster. Local rearrangements in the core were supported by chemical shift perturbations of buried residues, principally Ile1379 and Phe1380. Together, these changes yielded a more globular structure in the FYVE domain complex. Membrane insertion of an exposed hydrophobic loop stabilized the complex. Upon addition of micelles to the PtdIns(3)P-bound FYVE domain, the resonances of the Phe1364-Ser-Val-Thr-Val1368 loop migrated and broadened (13), presumably because of direct insertion into the lipid bilayer (Fig. 4D). Indeed, membranes devoid of PtdIns(3)P can interact similarly with the FYVE domain, as judged by the small parallel shifts of the Val1366 and Thr1367 resonances upon addition of DPC alone (Fig. 4C). However, the nonspecific complex was much weaker because, even at a 600-fold excess concentration of DPC, the micelle-bound state was still not saturated (13). In addition, this nonspecific association was less extensive than the specific membrane interaction, which also involved Gln1355, Phe1364, Val1368, Arg1369, and Ala1382. Membrane insertion critically enhances affinity, because the FYVE domain binds PtdIns(3)P-containing liposomes with a binding affinity of 50 nM (14 ) and binds micelle-free PtdIns(3)P with a micromolar affinity; furthermore, membrane localization of EEA1 is abrogated by Val1366-Thr1367 mutations (15). Nonspecific membrane insertion may position and prime the PtdIns(3)P binding site. The mobile Lys1347-Trp-Ala1349 residues appeared to be pried away from the PtdIns(3)P pocket upon micelle association. In particular, the cross-peaks of these residues migrated in directions that were essentially exactly opposite to those induced by PtdIns(3)P ligation (13). Furthermore, pocket opening required articulation about the Asn1352-Glu-Val1354 hinge. The backbone amide peaks of these hinge residues again shifted away from their closed conformation values. Thus, as a result of the mobility of the NH2-terminal element and hinge, the FYVE domain existed in partially open, fully open, and closed conformations, depending on whether it was unligated, membrane-primed, or PtdIns(3)P-engaged. We postulate that sequential progression through these states allows FYVE domains to target to endosomal membranes in a rapid, specific, and stable fashion. Although the structure of the EEA1 FYVE domain was similar in topology to those reported for Vps27p (10) and Hrs (11), the inferred binding mechanisms differ fundamentally. Direct ligation of the 3-phosphate by Arg220 of Vps27p (which is equivalent to Arg1399 of EEA1) is not substantiated by mutations (14 ) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, which revealed distinct hydrogen bonding to Arg1374. Ligation of the 1-phosphate by Hrs residues His178 and Arg208 (corresponding to EEA1 residues His1371 and Arg1399, respectively) is inconsistent with the NMR studies, which instead implicated Arg1369 and Arg1370. Lipid bilayer interactions predicted for the Vps27p Lys181Lys182 residues or the Hrs 3 and 4 strands were not observed in the homologous EEA1 residues. Moreover, the predicted membrane orientation of the Hrs FYVE domain differs from the micellebinding interface of the EEA1 FYVE domain. Priming and clamping of the PtdIns(3)P pocket of EEA1 depended on a key tryptophan, which in the Hrs structure mediates dimerization. An irregular strand in the crystal structures does not resemble any conformation of EEA1's flexible hinge and mobile element. Some of these differences may be influenced by unphysiological crystal contacts (10) and

dimerization interfaces seen in crystals (11) that are not supported by the apparent monomeric state of Hrs expressed in cells (16 ). General 3-phosphoinositide recognition principles are shared by FYVE domains and pleckstrin homology domains (17, 18). Despite the lack of any homology, both domains ligate the 3-phosphate asymmetrically by HN and HN groups of a conserved arginine, which is assisted by a second basic residue. Moreover, the 1-phosphate consistently forms hydrogen bonds with a polar residue separated from this arginine by three extended NH2-terminal residues. Finally, an exposed hydrophobic loop proximal to the point of 1-phosphate ligation is positioned near the membrane. In summary, we propose that EEA1 is targeted to endosomes through several stages. The FYVE domain is recruited to membranes through insertion of a conserved hydrophobic loop into the lipid bilayer. This weak membrane complex opens the binding site, priming it for specific recognition of PtdIns(3)P, ligation of which clamps the mobile termini down. Potential competitors such as PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns are excluded by indirect and direct readout of the phosphorylation state of the inositol ring. Simultaneous ligation of PtdIns(3)P and insertion into the membrane enhances affinity. Greater avidity for endosomes is afforded by parallel dimerization of EEA1's coiled-coil region (19). Finally, the structural plasticity of the FYVE domain suggests that it may play a key role in dynamically integrating Rab5 (6, 7) and syntaxins (8, 9) into the endosomal membrane fusion complex.

Samples contained 0 to 2 mM of the FYVE domain, 10% or 99.9% 2H2O, 20 mM tris-d11 buffer ( pH 6.8 or 5.2), 200 mM KCl, 20 mM perdeuterated dithiothreitol, 1 mM NaN3, 50 M 4-amidinophenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, 0 to 600 mM perdeuterated DPC, 0 to 5 mM dibutanoyl PtdIns(3)P, 0 to 1 mM PtdIns(5)P, and 0 to 0.6 mM PtdIns (Echelon Research Laboratories). NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on Varian INOVA (600 and 500 MHz) and Mercury (400 MHz) spectrometers. Resonances were assigned from homonuclear and 31P-edited total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC), 1H-13C HSQC, (HB)CBCA(CO)NNH, HNCACB, HNCO, HCCH, H(CCO)NH, and C(CO)NH TOCSY spectra. NOEs were assigned from 15N- and 13C-edited NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) and 13C F 1 filtered, F2-edited NOESY experiments.
