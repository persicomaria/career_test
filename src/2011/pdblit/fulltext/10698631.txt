Summary : Zinc insulin hexamerhasbeenshownto undergoa phenol-induced to R, T, conformational transition in solution. Our circular dichroic (CD) studies demonstrate insulin that undergoes pH-dependentconformationalchangesover the pH rangeof 6-10 in the T-stateand in the R- state. In order to determinewhich specific amino acid residues may be responsible for thesepH-dependentchanges,a series insulin analogs of were utilized. In the T-state, the pH dependent changes CD monitoredin the far UV region have a pK of 8.2 and appearto be related to the titration of the Al-Gly aminogroup. Using the nearUV CD a second pH-dependent conformational changewasdetectedwith a pK of 7.5 in the T-state. `H N.M.R. studiessuggest that BS-His may be responsible this conformationaltransition. In the presence m-cresol(Rfor of state),the pK value was found to be 6.9. During this titration, the increased ellipticity for the Rstateis diminishing aspH decreases from pH 8 to 6, and no difference in ellipticity wasobserved at 255 nm betweenT- and R-statesat pH 6. Therefore, this may be due to the transition from the R back to the T-state. `81992 Academic Inc. Press,

Recentstudieson insulin have emphasized flexibility of the peptidehormoneand its the propensity to undergostructuralchange. Crystallographicanalysishasdemonstrated that crystallization in the presence phenoliccompounds of gives an R, hexamerin which all six subunitshave undergonea T to R conformationaltransition (1). The principal changefor the T to R transition is the switch of Bl-B8 residues from extendedconformation (T-state) to helix (Rstate). The available spectroscopic evidencefrom tH NMR and circular dichroismand the rapid kinetic studiesindicatedthat the T- and R- states found in the crystal can be induced in solution by the binding of lyotropic anionsor by phenolic compounds (2-4). M-cresol, for instance,increases the circular dichroismin the far-UV, correspondingto an increasein helix, and around 255 nm (2). Despiteextensive studies the T- and R- statesof zinc or cobalt insulin in solution, their pH on dependent conformational changes have not heenreported. One possible reasonmay be the isoelectricprecipitation occurring in the neutralpH range. We were ableto study pH dependent conformational changes zinc insulin in solution(in the T- stateandthe R-state)from neutralto of basicpH rangein the presence an ionic stabilizer(citric acid), which extendsthe solublepH of rangeof zinc insulin down to 5.5.

Material andMethods Zinc biosynthetic humaninsulin wasobtainedfrom Eli Lilly & Co, Insulin analogues, carbamylatedinsulins(5), and BlO-Asp insulin (6), were kindly provided by Mr. JamesA. Hoffmann andDr. Ronald E. Chance,respectively, of DiabetesResearch Eli Lilly & Co. All of chemicals were of analytical gradeor higher. Samples CD experimentswere preparedby for combining acidic zinc insulin solution (1.7 mM insulin and 1.2 mM Zn) with an equalvolume of basicbuffer solution containing 5.2 mM citric acid, and 0 or 10.5mM m-cresol. The initial pH of the mixture was approximate6, and further pH adjustments were madewith a smallamountof HCl or NaOH if necessary. Insulin concentrationswere determinedby UV absorbance using an extinction coefficient of 1.05 at 276 nm for 1 mg/ml solutionin a 1 cm path length. It was assumed that insulin derivatives have the same extinction coefficient asinsulin. CD measurements were madewith an Aviv 62D spectrometer. The `H N.M.R. spectrawere obtainedwith a Bruker AMXSOO spectrometer operatedat 500 MHz. Chemical shifts were measured using Sodium-3-(trimethyl silyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-D4asan external standard.Samplesfor N.M.R. were preparedin the sameway asthat for CD, but using QO, NaOD, and DCl. pHs of the samples were uncorrectedfor deuteriumisotopeeffects and adjustedwith NaOD and DCl. Titrations for pKa measurements L-histidine were performedusinga VIT 90 Video Titrator, of RadiometerCopenhagen.

ResultsandDiscussion The far UV CD spectraof zinc-insulin taken at various pH valuesin the absence mof cresolare shown in Fig. 1A. Single wavelength multiple measurements were madeat 224 nm, which reflects primarily a-helix, and plotted againstpH in Fig. 1B (The solidline is a theoretical curve using the equationof log (Y/l-Y) = pKa - n(pH), whereY is the fractional CD changeand n is the numberof participating protons.). The circular dichroismof insulin decreases with increasingpH in the pH rangeof 7 to 10. The experimentalresultssuggest zinc insulin in that solution undergoes pH dependentconformationaltransition with a pK of 8.2. Theoretical a calculationsindicate that one proton is involved in this pH titration. This titration is reversibleand independentof insulin concentration up to 8.5 mM. After blocking the chargesof the two N-terminal amino groupsby carbamylation, the pH dependent conformational changedetectedby far-UV CD (seeFig. 1C) completely disappeared. Therefore A 1-Gly or B 1-Phe mustbe responsible the pH dependent for conformationaltransition describedin Fig. 1B. However, blocking the chargeof only Bl did not perturb the pH dependent CD change. Therefore it can be concludedthat it is attributableto A 1-Gly. The protonation of A lGly appears stabilize the a-helix of insulin. A similar pH dependentCD changehasbeen to observedby Packer and Biswas with a very dilute insulin solution in the absence zinc (7). They of interpreted the resultsasa dissociationof the higher associated statesto monomers a as consequence high chargerepulsion.Under the zinc and insulin concentrationsusedin these of studies,however, it is unlikely that insulin dissociates easily. Moreover, if we accepttheir interpretation for our system,one would expect to seethe sameCD changes A 1, B lfor dicarbamoyl insulin in the samepH rangeunless chargesof N-terminushave an effect on the association dissociationstates insulin. Our CD experimentsindicate that Al, B1-dicarbamoyl of insulin alsoundergoes T to R conformationaltransition in solution on addition of m-cresol(data a not shown). 1116

pH titrations of the far-UV CD of insulin andAl, B 1-dicarbamoylinsulin were madein the presence m-cresol (R-state), and shownin Fig. 1D. In the R-statealso,pH dependent of confoxmationalchangeswere detectedby far-UV CD in the pH rangeof 7 to 9.5. However, these disappeared after carbamylationof the two terminal amino groups.In a separate experiment,it was confirmed that Bl-carbamoyl insulin showedthe same trend asregular insulin in this pH range.

The near-UV CD alsochanges a function of PH. Fig. 2B as showsthe pH titration of the near-UV CD of insulin at 255 nm. Thesedata showthat insulin undergoes anotherpH dependentconformationaltransition with a pK of 7.5. Theoretical calculationsindicate that it is a one-protonevent. In a separate experiment, we confirmed that modification of NH,-Bl by carbamylation or BlO-His by substitutionwith Asp did not perturb the 1117

C: Titration curves of histidine resonances of insulin in D,O measured by `H N.M.R. spectroscopy. The samples contained 0.85 mM insulin, 0.60 mM zinc and 2.6 mM citric acid. pH was measured with a combination glass electrode, and uncorrected isotope for effect.

pH dependentCD changes.Therefore, it may be due to BS-His. The pK value of BS-His hasbeen directly determinedby lH N.M.R. spectroscopy. Bradbury et al. reported the first assignment of the H-2 resonances the BS-His and BlO-His residues zinc insulin in D,O (8). On going from of of low to high pH, the position of the resonance shifts upfield 1 p.p.m. in both histidines. The titration curves (seeFig. 2C) we obtainedfrom the N.M.R. spectraof zinc insulin solutionsat different pH values indicate that both histidineshave pKs of 7.5 (pH wasmeasured with a combinationglasselectrode,and uncorrectedfor isotopeeffect ) (9). The pK value is the sameas that obtained by the CD experiment. Therefore, the pH dependent changesat 255 nm should CD be attributable to BS-His. According to the zinc insulin crystal structute, BS-His is hydrogen bondedto A7-Cys, which forms a disulfide bond with B7-Cys (10). The deprotonationof B5His may affect the dihedral angleof the disulfide bond. The pK value of this transition in the absence zinc hasbeenreported to be 7 (11). The discrepancyof 0.5 pH unit betweenthe two of studiesmay be due to solvent effect. 1118

A: pH dependentCD of insulin at 255 nm in the presence of m-cresol (R- state) : A m comparison with that of T-state. B: Far-UV CD change afunctionof pH in thepresence mas of cresol (R-state): comparison thatof T-state.Thesamples A with contained mM insulin,0.60 0.85 mM zinc, 2.6mM citric acid,and0 (T-state) 5.25mM (R-state) or m-cresol.

In Fig. 3A, the pH dependentCD of insulin monitoredat 255 nm in the presence m-cresol of (R- state)is comparedwith that of the T-state.In the presence m-cresol,the pK of the titration of (6.9) was found to be lower than that of the T-state (7.5). The pK valuesof L-histidine were determinedin the presence in the absence m-cresolwith an automated and of titrator to evaluate the solvent effect. Under the m-cresolconcentrationusedin thesestudies,the solvent effect causedby m-cresolon all three pK valuesof L-histidine wasfound to be negligible within an experimental error. X-ray crystallographic studieshave shownthat BS-His in the R-stateis in a more hydrophobic environment than in the T-statedue to the binding of phenolic compound(1). The lower pKa observedfor the R-stateseems agreewell with the explanation. This transition to detectedby near-UV CD titrates two protonsaccordingto the theoreticalcalculation,however. As other workers already observed,at pH 7.8 - 8.0 the addition of m-cresolresultsin an increasein meanresidueellipticity at around255 nm. The difference in ellipticity betweenthe T and the R becomes negligible at pH 6. A similarsituationhasbeendemonstrated the far-UV CD also(see in Fig. 3B). Therefore, this may be due to the transition from the R back to the T-stateassociated with a possibletitration of BS-His and anotheraminoacid residue. In the pH rangeof 6 to 10, the ellipticities of insulin at 224 nm were increasedby addition of m-cresolcorrespondingto increases helix (seeFig. 3B). Similar pH dependentCD changes in (at 224 nm) were observedfor the R-statein the samepH range (pH 6 to 7.5) asdescribedin Fig. 3A for the R-state. However, in the T-state,thesepH dependent conformationalchanges were not detectedat 224 nm, but were presentat 255 nm. This suggests the conformational changein that the R-statemustbe due to one of the eight residues betweenBl-B8 which are helical in the R-state only. Consideringthe pH rangein which the CD changes occurring and all the observations are describedabove, it is likely that it is alsorelated to the deprotonationBS-His. It is not clear, however, whetherit is a direct effect of the deprotonationof BS-His on stabilizing an a-helix of the N-terminus of the B-chain, or whether we are simply observinga transition from the R- back to the T- statepossibly associated with the protonation of BS-His. 1119
