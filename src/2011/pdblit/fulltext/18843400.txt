Received 30th May 2008, Accepted 4th July 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 11th August 2008 DOI: 10.1039/b809178a Recently, we designed a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors incorporating a stereochemically defined bicyclic fused cyclopentyl (Cp-THF) urethane as the high affinity P2-ligand. Inhibitor 1 with this P2-ligand has shown very impressive potency against multi-drug-resistant clinical isolates. Based upon the 1-bound HIV-1 protease X-ray structure, we have now designed and synthesized a number of meso-bicyclic ligands which can conceivably interact similarly to the Cp-THF ligand. The design of meso-ligands is quite attractive as they do not contain any stereocenters. Inhibitors incorporating urethanes of bicyclic-1,3-dioxolane and bicyclic-1,4-dioxane have shown potent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral activities. Inhibitor 2 (K i = 0.11 nM; IC50 = 3.8 nM) displayed very potent antiviral activity in this series. While inhibitor 3 showed comparable enzyme inhibitory activity (K i = 0.18 nM) its antiviral activity (IC50 = 170 nM) was significantly weaker than inhibitor 2. Inhibitor 2 maintained an antiviral potency against a series of multi-drug resistant clinical isolates comparable to amprenavir. A protein­ligand X-ray structure of 3-bound HIV-1 protease revealed a number of key hydrogen bonding interactions at the S2-subsite. We have created an active model of inhibitor 2 based upon this X-ray structure.

Introduction
The proteolytic enzyme HIV-1 protease is essential for viral assembly and maturation.1 As a consequence, the design of specific inhibitors for HIV-1 protease has become the subject of immense interest. In 1996, protease inhibitors (PIs) were introduced in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors to become a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).2 This treatment regimen significantly increased life expectancy, improved quality of life and decreased mortality and morbidity among HIV/AIDS patients. Despite these notable advances, the emergence of drugresistant HIV-1 variants is severely limiting the efficacy of HAART treatment regimens. Therefore, the development of new broadspectrum antiretroviral drugs that produce minimal adverse effects remains an important therapeutic objective for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.3 We have recently reported our structure-based design and development of a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors including darunavir,4,5 TMC-126,6 and GRL-06579A (1, Fig. 1).7 These inhibitors were designed with specific features

to help combat drug resistance. They have exhibited marked potency in enzyme inhibitory and cell-culture assays. Furthermore, these inhibitors have shown impressive activity against a broadspectrum of HIV isolates including a variety of multi-PI-resistant clinical strains. Darunavir has been recently approved for the therapy of HIV/AIDS patients who are harboring drug-resistant HIV and do not respond to other antiretroviral drugs. Org. Biomol.

One of our design principles to combat drug resistance is to maximize the ligand-binding interactions in the active site and particularly to promote extensive hydrogen bonding with the active site protein backbone. Indeed, inhibitor 1 incorporates a stereochemically defined bicyclic cyclopentanyltetrahydrofuran (Cp-THF) as the P2-ligand in the hydroxylethylsulfonamide isostere. The protein­ligand X-ray structure of inhibitor 1 revealed extensive hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone atoms throughout the enzyme active site.8 The cyclic ether oxygen is involved in hydrogen bonding with the backbone NH of Asp29. The presence of this oxygen is critical for its superb antiviral properties, especially against drug resistant HIV strains. Based upon further examination of the protein­ligand X-ray structure of 1-bound HIV-1 protease, we subsequently speculated that a simplified meso-hexahydrocyclopenta-1,3-dioxolane ligand could conceivably maintain similar interactions with respect to the CpTHF ligand in inhibitor 1. Particularly, it appears that one of the oxygens of this meso ligand can hydrogen bond with the Asp29 NH. Since the Cp-THF ligand in inhibitor 1 contains three chiral centers, incorporation of a meso ligand as shown in inhibitor 2 would remarkably simplify the synthesis compared to the bicyclic Cp-THF ligand. Furthermore, we speculated that the second oxygen atom in the meso-P2-ligand could conceivably engage in further interactions at the S2-subsite. Herein, we report the design, synthesis and biological investigation of a series of protease inhibitors that incorporate structure-based designed symmetrical meso-bicyclic 1,3-dioxolane and 1,3-dioxane derivatives as the P2ligands. Inhibitors (2 and 3) incorporating these ligands have shown exceedingly potent enzyme inhibitory potency as well as antiviral activity. Furthermore, we evaluated the drug-resistance profile of inhibitor 2 against multi-drug-resistant clinical isolates and it was shown to maintain tremendous potency. The protein­ ligand X-ray structure of 3-bound HIV-1 protease has been determined and this structure has provided molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions.

Chemistry
The hexahydrocyclopenta-1,3-dioxolan-5-ol (11), required for the synthesis of 2, was prepared as described in Scheme 1. Commercially available 1,6-heptadien-4-ol 4 was protected as the corresponding t-butyldiphenylsilyl ether using sodium hydride as the base in THF. The resulting diene was subjected to a ring closing metathesis reaction using second generation Grubbs' catalyst to afford the protected cyclopenten-1-ol 5 in 94% overall yield. Osmium tetroxide-promoted dihydroxylation of olefin 5 was accomplished using a catalytic amount of osmium tetroxide and NMO and pyridine to afford diol 6 as a 6 : 1 mixture of anti- and syn-isomers which were easily separated by column chromatography. The anti- isomer 6 was subsequently treated with paraformaldehyde, preliminarily cracked with aqueous hydrochloric acid in chloroform under reflux,9 affording the cyclic acetal 7 in good yield. Along with the desired compound 7, the trioxepane 8 was also isolated from the reaction mixture in a 1 : 1 ratio. We therefore decided to incorporate the tetrahydro-5aHcyclopenta[f ][1,3,5]trioxepan-7-yl-moiety as a P2-ligand (resulting in inhibitors 27­28, Table 1) because the higher flexibility of the trioxepane ring could allow an improved adaptability to enzyme amino acid mutations, leading to better activity against HIV3704 | Org.

resistant strains. Accordingly, both intermediates 7 and 8 were deprotected using tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in THF to provide the anti-alcohols 9 and 10. Compounds 9 and 10 were subsequently subjected to Mitsunobu inversion to afford the corresponding syn-alcohols 11 and 12. For the preparation of inhibitors 3 and 29, alcohols 15 and 16 were synthesized as described in Scheme 2. Diol 6 was heated under reflux in toluene in the presence of dibutyltin oxide with azeotropic removal of water. The resulting stannylene acetal intermediate was treated with chloroethanol to obtain the monoalkylated derivative 13 in 68% overall yield.10 Subsequently, the primary

alcohol was selectively tosylated with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of pyridine. Exposure of the resulting compound to sodium hydride resulted in an intramolecular substitution reaction leading to the corresponding cyclization compound 14. TBAFmediated deprotection furnished the target anti-alcohol 15 in good overall yield. The syn-alcohol 16 was then obtained after Mitsunobu inversion of 15 as described above. The synthesis of the active carbonates required for the synthesis of the various inhibitors is shown in Scheme 3. Alcohol 9 was converted to the succinimidyl-derivative 17 by treatment with N,N¢-succinimidylcarbonate in the presence of Et3 N as described previously.11 Alcohols 10­12, 15 and 16 were activated by conversion to the corresponding p-nitrophenylcarbamates 18­ 22 (81­95% yield) by using p-nitrophenylchloroformate and Nmethylmorpholine in THF. The general procedure for the synthesis of inhibitors 2, 3 and 26­30 is outlined in Scheme 4. Epoxide 2312 was converted into intermediate 24 following our previously reported procedure.8 Deprotection of 24 by using trifluoroacetic acid followed by reaction with the activated alcohols 17­22 furnished inhibitors 2, 3 and 26­29 in 43­85% yields.

Results and discussion
The inhibitory potencies of the synthetic inhibitors were evaluated using the assay protocol of Toth and Marshall,13 and the results are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, inhibitor 2 has shown an enzyme inhibitory potency of 0.11 nM. It appears that the bicyclic 1,3-dioxolane ring can be accommodated by the S2-subsite of HIV-1 protease. Inhibitor 26 with a meso ligand containing a trans-bicyclic-1,3-dioxolane ring is 2.5-fold less potent than the syn-isomer 2. We have examined the effect of both syn and antitrioxepane rings as P2-ligands in inhibitors 27 and 28. The synisomer 28 is significantly more potent (K i = 0.51 nM) than the antiisomer 27. Considering the acid sensitivity of 1,3-dioxolane rings, we not only speculated that the stable 1,4-dioxane ring may fill the hydrophobic S2-site, but also that the oxygens on the dioxane ring may interact with backbone atoms or residues in the active site. As shown, the meso ligand in inhibitor 3 with a syn-bicyclic-1,4dioxane ring has shown an enzyme inhibitory potency of 0.18 nM (K i value). Consistent with previous results, the corresponding anti-isomer 29 is significantly less potent. As reported previously, the P2-ligand Cp-THF with a P2¢-hydroxymethyl sulfonamide (inhibitor 1) is significantly more potent than the corresponding P2¢-methoxybenzene sulfonamide derivative. We have, therefore, compared the inhibitory potency of inhibitor 30, containing a P2¢-hydroxymethyl benzene sulfonamide derivative, with inhibitor 2. However, inhibitor 30 did not exhibit this potency enhancing effect. We have examined selected compounds for their activity against HIV-1 using a human CD4+ T-cell line (MT-2 cells). The activity of inhibitor 2 against a variety of multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 variants was also examined in detail using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as target cells. We employed two endpoints for the activity against HIV-1: (i) the inhibition of the HIV-1-elicited cytopathic effect for MT-2 cells and (ii) the inhibition of HIV-1 p24 production for PBMCs.5 Org.

Finally, inhibitor 30 was synthesized from the known8 amine 25. This amine was reacted with the activated carbonate 17 in the presence of diisopropylethylamine in THF at 23  C to provide 30. Inhibitor 30 was obtained in 63% yield. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008

When examined in MT-2 cells as the target cells, inhibitor 2 displayed an impressive antiviral IC50 of 3.8 nM (Table 1). Inhibitor 3 showed an antiviral IC50 value in the high nanomolar range (IC50 = 210 nM, Table 1), while it exhibited a similar K i to inhibitor 2. We subsequently examined inhibitor 2 for its activity against a clinical wild-type X4-HIV-1 isolate (HIV-1ERS104pre ) along with various multi-drug-resistant clinical X4- and R5-HIV-1 isolates (Table 2) using PBMCs as the target cells.5 The activity of inhibitor 2 against HIV-1ERS104pre (IC50 = 29 nM) was comparable to those of currently available protease inhibitors, SQV, APV, and IDV, which display IC50 values of 12, 33, and 26 nM, respectively. Of particular note, the IC50 value of inhibitor 2 in PBMCs (IC50 = 29 nM) was nearly 8-fold greater than the IC50 value in MT-2 cells

(IC50 = 3.8 nM). With regard to this difference, considering that 2 is highly potent as examined in human T-cells (MT-2 cells) but its activity is slightly less in PBMCs, it is possible that relatively higher concentrations of 2 are required to suppress HIV-1 production in chronically infected macrophages.14 IDV was not capable of efficiently suppressing the replication of most of the multi-drugresistant clinical isolates examined (HIV-1MDR/MM , HIV-1MDR/JSL , HIV-1MDR/C , and HIV-1MDR/A ), with IC50 values of >1.0 mM. The potency of inhibitor 2 against most of the multi-drug-resistant variants was generally comparable to that of SQV and APV, although DRV was found to be the most potent among those tested, including inhibitor 2, against HIV-1ERS104pre as well as all the multi-drug-resistant variants.

X-Ray crystallography To obtain molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions responsible for the impressive enzyme inhibitory potency of compound 3, we determined the X-ray structure of 3-bound HIV1 protease. The crystal structure was solved and refined to an R ° factor of 15.2% at a 1.07 A resolution. The inhibitor binds with extensive interactions from P2 to P2¢ with the protease atoms, and most notable are the favorable polar interactions including hydrogen bonds, as shown in Fig. 2. The transition-state hydroxyl group forms hydrogen bonds to the side chain carboxylate oxygen atoms of the catalytic Asp25 and Asp25¢. Of particular interest, the meso-bicyclic 1,4-dioxane ligand appears to be involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone atoms and residues at the S2-site. One of the dioxane oxygens hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Asp29. The other oxygen makes a watermediated hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly48. These interactions are described in several peptide substrate analogs.15 However, the design of high affinity ligands incorporating this interaction with Gly48 has not been previously demonstrated. The inhibitor also hydrogen bonds with the protease main chain amide carbonyl oxygen of Gly27, and there are water-mediated interactions with the amides of Ile50 and Ile50¢ that are conserved in the majority of protease complexes with inhibitors16 and

substrate analogs.15 The weaker polar interactions such as C­ H    O and water-p interactions can be analyzed accurately in atomic resolution structures.17,18 Inhibitor 3 also shows a watermediated interaction of the p system of the P2¢ aromatic ring with the amide of Asp29¢, which was also observed for darunavir and inhibitor 1.19 Furthermore, the P2¢ methoxy group forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone NH of Asp30¢. Importantly, the P2 group forms a hydrogen bond interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly48 and a water-mediated interaction with the amide of Gly48, similar to the interactions described for several peptide substrate analogs.15 These interactions of the P2 group confirm the design strategy of incorporating new polar interactions with conserved backbone regions of the protease. In an effort to understand the binding interactions of the corresponding meso-1,3-dioxolane ligand in the S2-subsite, we have created an active model of inhibitor 2 (Fig. 3) based upon the X-ray structure of 3-bound HIV-1 protease. The model suggests that both dioxolane oxygens may interact with both active site residues Asp29 and Asp30, as well as Gly48 through the structural water molecule. In comparison, it appears that the dioxane oxygens of inhibitor 3 are not within hydrogen bonding distance of the backbone NH of Asp30. This may explain the marked difference in antiviral activity of inhibitor 2 compared with inhibitor 3.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors were designed and synthesized by incorporating bicyclic meso-1,3dioxolane and 1,4-dioxane derivatives as the P2-ligands. A number of inhibitors have shown very impressive enzyme inhibitory and antiviral potency, similar to inhibitor 1 with a stereochemically defined Cp-THF ligand. The design of meso-1,3-dioxolane and 1,4-dioxane P2-ligands as exemplified in inhibitors 2 and 3, respectively, has remarkably simplified the stereochemical complexity as well as chemical synthesis over the Cp-THF ligand in inhibitor 1. We have developed efficient synthetic routes to these ligands. Inhibitor 2 has shown potent antiviral activity in both MT2 cells and PBMCs. Inhibitor 2 was profiled against a series of multi-drug-resistant clinical isolates. While inhibitor 2 is less potent than darunavir, it is significantly more potent than IDV and comparable to APV and SQV in suppressing the replication of multi-drug-resistant isolates MDRMM and MDRJSL . A protein­ligand X-ray structure of 3-bound HIV-1 protease revealed extensive interactions of the inhibitor with the active site of HIV-1 protease. Most notably, both oxygens of the mesoP2-ligand are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with the protein backbone atoms. In particular, a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the Gly48 carbonyl is very unique. An active model of inhibitor 2 indicates similar ligand binding site interactions. Our design principle of increasing `backbone binding' appears to maintain key interactions in the enzyme active site leading to retained potency against multi-drug-resistant variants. Further design and ligand optimization involving these interactions is in progress.

The HIV-1 protease construct with the substitutions Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A to optimize protein stability,20 was expressed and purified as described.21 Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using a 1 : 15 molar ratio of protease at 2.0 mg mL-1 and the inhibitor dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. The reservoir contained 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH = 4.2) and 1.5 M NaCl. Crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution containing the reservoir solution and 20­30% (v/v) glycerol, mounted on a nylon loop and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on the SER-CAT beamline of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data were processed using HKL200022 resulting in a Rmerge value of 7.0% (41.8%) ° for 90 315 unique reflections between 50 and 1.07 A resolution with a completeness of 88.1% (51.3%), where the values in parentheses are for the final highest resolution shell. Data were reduced in space ° ° group P21 21 2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 58.00 A, b = 86.34 A ° and c = 45.83 A with one dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the CPP4i suite of programs,23,24 with the structure of the D30N mutant of HIV protease in complex with GRL-98065 (2QCI)19 as the starting model. The structure was refined using SHELX9725 and refitted manually using the molecular graphics programs O26 and COOT.27 Alternate conformations were modeled for the protease residues when obvious in the electron density maps. Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters (B-factors) were refined for all atoms including solvent molecules. Hydrogen atoms were added at the final stages of the refinement.
