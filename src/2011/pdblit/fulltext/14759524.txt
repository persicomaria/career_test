Apoptosis: Silencing the death receptors
Jürg Tschopp*, Fabio Martinon* and Kay Hofmann

Spontaneous signaling from death-domain-containing receptors can result in inappropriate cell death. An inhibitory protein has recently been identified, called silencer of death domains (SODD), that binds to the death domain of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, thereby negatively regulating downstream signaling.

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family are critically involved in the regulation of infections, inflammation, autoimmune diseases and tissue homeostasis. Binding of these ligands to their respective receptors leads to the triggering of diverse signaling pathways, including the activation of caspases, the activation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor B (NF-B), and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases such as Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). As each of these pathways leads to different outcomes, TNF-related ligands can promote apoptosis, differentiation, or proliferation. The TNF-related factors are synthesized as trimeric type II transmembrane molecules [1] that are capable of oligomerizing (trimerizing) the corresponding receptor. Consequently, ligand-bound receptors transmit the signal across the membrane by bringing their cytoplasmic portions into close proximity, leading to the recruitment and activation of downstream effector proteins. Those members of the TNF receptor family that induce apoptosis have in their cytoplasmic region a sequence of approximately 70 amino acids called the death domain, which is essential for signal transmission [2]. These domains represent protein­protein interaction motifs that have an intrinsic propensity to oligomerize and to interact with other death domains in a homophilic fashion. At present, six death-domain-containing receptors have been identified -- Fas, TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1), death receptor 3 (DR3; also known as TRAMP, Wsl, APO-3 and LARD), the two receptors for TNFrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) TRAILR1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5, and DR6 [2]. Out of all of these receptors, the apoptotic signaling pathways downstream of Fas and TNF-R1 have been studied most extensively. The oligomerized death domain of activated Fas specifically binds to the death domain of

the adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), whereas in the case of TNF-R1 FADD recruitment occurs indirectly via another adaptor molecule, TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD). In both cases, FADD then binds to the apoptosis-inducing cysteine protease caspase-8, connecting receptor activation with the apoptotic machinery and initiating the cascade of caspase activation. In contrast to Fas which, in almost all cases, signals cell death, the biological function of TNF-R1 is more diverse, however. This diversity is reflected in the increased complexity of proteins that are present in the TNF-R1 signaling complex (Figure 1). TNF-R1 first recruits TRADD, which in turn not only recruits FADD, as mentioned, but also recruits TNFRassociated factor 2 (TRAF2) and the kinase receptorinteracting protein (RIP). TRAF2 is essential for JNK activation [3], whereas RIP is instrumental for the activation of the NF-B pathway [4]. Artificial overexpression of most death-domain-containing proteins causes cell death in a ligand-independent manner, because of the spontaneous self-aggregation of death domains that occurs with higher frequency when these proteins are expressed above physiological levels. The mere overexpression of TNF-R1, for example, initiates all three signaling pathways -- that is, activation of caspases, NF-B and JNK -- and it has therefore been difficult to generate cell lines that express death receptors at high levels. But many cells express death receptors at relatively high surface densities, and yet spontaneous trimerization resulting in a productive signal is not observed. How then is the spontaneous, and presumably lethal, aggregation of cytoplasmic death domains avoided, considering the tendency of the death domains to self-aggregate? A recent report now provides new insight into a possible mechanism for silencing of death receptors [5]. Using the cytoplasmic domain of DR3 as `bait' in a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen, a 457 amino acid protein termed SODD, for silencer of death domains, was identified. This protein specifically bound to the death domain of DR3 and TNF-R1 but not to that of Fas or the two TRAIL receptors. In the presence of SODD, TRADD binding to TNF-R1 was not observed, suggesting that SODD blocks signaling pathways downstream of TNF-R1 (and, by implication, DR3). Indeed, overexpression of SODD suppressed the capacity of TNF to activate NF-B and to cause cell death and, conversely, expression of SODD antisense mRNA led to increased NF-B signaling and decreased cell viability. TNF-R1 and SODD were found to be pre-associated in non-stimulated cells, and

Figure 1 The TNF-R1 signaling pathway. (a) In the absence of TNF, SODD and possibly Hsp70/Hsc70 are associated with the monomeric form of TNF-R1. SODD and Hsp70/Hsc70 inhibit the intrinsic selfaggregating properties of the death domain of TNF-R1 and maintain the receptor in an inactive, signaling-incompetent state. (b) Crosslinking of the receptor through the trimeric TNF triggers the release of SODD and Hsp70/Hsc70. The unbound death domain of TNF-R1 then recruits TRADD via an interaction between the death domains of these molecules. TRADD in turn recruits FADD, TRAF2 or RIP to form the TNF-R1 signaling complex. Activation of signaling pathways leading to apoptosis (via the FADD­caspase-8 complex), JNK (via TRAF2) and NF-B (via RIP) follows. This signaling complex rapidly dissociates, allowing SODD (and probably Hsp70/Hsc70) to bind again to the death domain of TNF-R1. (c) It is conceivable that downregulation of SODD by currently unknown stimuli (see text) sensitizes cells to TNF-induced signals, leading to signal induction that is ligand-independent.

TNF-induced receptor trimerization led to the rapid dissociation of SODD from TNF-R1 (occurring within 5 minutes) allowing the recruitment of TRADD and the assembly of an active signaling complex. Binding of the signaling proteins was transient, though, because 10 minutes after the addition of ligand, these proteins were dissociated from the receptor and SODD was again bound, re-establishing the `normal', silent state of TNFR1. The probable importance of SODD in the control of TNF-R1 signals is underscored by its broad tissue distribution: SODD mRNA was found in all tissues tested, and SODD protein was detected in several human cell lines. We have searched databases for proteins homologous to SODD and have found a number of proteins with significant sequence identity to the carboxy-terminal 70 amino acids of SODD (Figure 2). This sequence motif is highly conserved in BAG-3 and BAG-5, containing between 40 and 60% identical residues. We found weak but significant homology to this region with BAG-1, a multifunctional protein that interacts with and regulates heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and the Hsp70 cellular homolog Hsc70. We therefore call this conserved motif the BAG domain as proposed by Takayama et al. [6]. Probable orthologs or homologs of BAG-domain-containing proteins are also identifiable in Caenorhabditis elegans, in yeast and in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Figure 2) [6]. The BAG domain of SODD, however, does not appear to be responsible for the binding of SODD to the death

domain of TNF-R1 for two main reasons: firstly, the aminoterminal part of SODD was the region isolated in the twohybrid screen with DR3; secondly, the BAG domain of BAG-1 and other BAG-family members is known to interact with the ATPase domain of Hsp70/Hsc70 [6,7]. The BAG domain of SODD may therefore bind to Hsp70/Hsc70 and not to TNF-R1. We have in fact found this to be true: when SODD and Hsc70 are overexpressed, a specific interaction between the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and the BAG domain of SODD is observed (our unpublished observations). Thus, we propose that SODD may act as an adaptor protein that targets Hsp70/Hsc70 to the cytoplasmic domain of TNF-R1. Could Hsp70/Hsc70 play an active role in preventing the spontaneous aggregation of death domains? Historically, Hsp70 was identified as molecule that is induced under stress conditions to prevent aggregation of cellular proteins by assisting the refolding of partially unfolded stretches of hydrophobic residues. Hsp70/Hsc70 also plays an essential role under normal growth conditions, however, including guiding protein translocation across organellar membranes, disassembling oligomeric protein structures and facilitating proteolytic degradation. These chaperone activities of mammalian Hsp70/Hsc70 are regulated by co-chaperones that modulate the peptide substrate cycle and/or target the actions of chaperones to specific proteins and subcellular locations [8]. Proteins that contain a J domain, which interacts with Hsp70/Hsc70, form one subfamily of co-chaperones that

Figure 2 SODD and related members of the BAG family bind to Hsp70/Hsc70. (a) Domain structure of the BAG-family members. All members contain a conserved BAG domain that has been demonstrated to interact with the ATPase domain of Hsc70 in the case of SODD (our unpublished observations), BAG-3, BAG-5 and BAG-1 [6]. The mammalian BAG family can be subdivided into two subfamilies: the SODD subfamily and the BAG-1 subfamily. Members of the SODD subfamily contain a BAG domain that is at least 40% identical to the other members of this subfamily; see (b). Members of the BAG-1 subfamily contain, in addition to the BAG domain, a ubiquitin-like domain (Ub). Additional domains, the calmodulin-interacting IQ domain (I) and the WW domain (W), are present in some members. The yellow box in Snl1 represents the transmembrane domain. BAG-family members have also been found in C. elegans (Ce), S. pombe (Sp), S. cerevisae (Sc), and A. thaliana (At). (b) Alignment of representative BAG-domain sequences.

stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70, resulting in the ADP-bound state of this chaperone that binds tightly to peptides. One of the best-studied J-domain-containing proteins is auxilin, which recruits Hsp70 to clathrin-coated vesicles causing the disassembly of the clathrin coat in a ATP-dependent manner. A similar role as co-chaperone has been attributed to the BAG members. BAG-1 stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp70/Hsc70, but has the opposite effect to auxilin [9]. The Hsp70/Hsc70-bound substrate is not released and instead remains in a partially unfolded, but not aggregated, state. By analogy with auxilin and BAG-1, we could therefore imagine a scenario where the BAG domain of SODD targets Hsp70/Hsc70 to hydrophobic surfaces of the cytoplasmic regions of TNF-R1, locking them in a silent state. If this notion is correct, we would anticipate that overexpression of Hsp70/Hsc70 inhibits TNF signaling. In agreement with this, increased levels of Hsp70 have been shown to protect cells from TNF-induced damage [10,11], and conversely, agents such as D-galactosamine that sensitize cells to TNF-mediated damage lower the levels of Hsp70 [12]. Thus, it is conceivable that TNF-R1 signals can be triggered not only by TNF binding but also in the absence of TNF in a ligand-independent manner, for example by downregulation of SODD (or Hsp70/Hsc70). This would explain why cells expressing SODD antisense mRNA show increased spontaneous NF-B signaling in the absence of TNF.

Silencing of signaling systems by complexes of BAGfamily members and Hsp70/Hsc70 may not be restricted to death receptor signaling. BAG-1 forms complexes with several other proteins including the glucocorticoid receptor [7], hepatocyte growth factor, the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 and, most notably, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 [13]. BAG-1 binding to Bcl-2 increases Bcl-2's antiapoptotic activity and it is therefore possible that BAG-1 recruits Hsp70/Hsc70 to Bcl-2. This recruitment may in turn block spontaneous binding of the pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax or Bak, to Bcl-2 [14]. The activity of many cellular proteins is regulated by association with silencing partners. The discovery of SODD has shed light on the mechanism by which cells are protected against spontaneous signals emanating from death receptors. Further studies of the biological roles played by SODD-like adaptor proteins and other BAG-family members are likely to provide insights into how other death receptors or signaling systems are kept in check.
