Src family kinases (SFKs) are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that are reported to be critical for cancer progression. We report here a novel subseries of C-5-substituted anilinoquinazolines that display high affinity and specificity for the tyrosine kinase domain of the c-Src and Abl enzymes. These compounds exhibit high selectivity for SFKs over a panel of recombinant protein kinases, excellent pharmacokinetics, and in vivo activity following oral dosing. N-(5-Chloro-1,3-benzodioxol-4-yl)-7-[2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethoxy]-5(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yloxy)quinazolin-4-amine (AZD0530) inhibits c-Src and Abl enzymes at low nanomolar concentrations and is highly selective over a range of kinases. AZD0530 displays excellent pharmacokinetic parameters in animal preclinically and in man (t1/2 ) 40 h). AZD0530 is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth in a c-Src-transfected 3T3-fibroblast xenograft model in vivo and led to a significant increase in survival in a highly aggressive, orthotopic model of human pancreatic cancer when dosed orally once daily. AZD0530 is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in man.
Introduction c-Src kinase is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that acts as a signal transduction inhibitor that is a critical component of multiple signaling pathways that control cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis. While c-Src kinase is highly regulated and active only at low levels in most normal cells, studies have shown that c-Src kinase is upregulated in many human tumor types.1,2 Recently emerging data support the hypothesis that the predominant consequence of increased c-Src activity in tumor cells is to reduce cell adhesion, facilitate motility, and thereby promote an invasive phenotype. Consequently, there is considerable interest in the inhibition of c-Src kinase as a treatment for cancer and in particular as an antiinvasion strategy. Tumor cell invasion is a feature common to all malignant tumors and is a process that occurs throughout the evolution of a cancer. There is evidence that c-Src kinase activity is an important component of the invasive phenotype in both early and advanced solid tumors. In early disease, c-Src kinase plays a key role in the epithelium to mesenchymal transition that marks the conversion of epithelial tumor cells to a more invasive phenotype.3 Increased c-Src kinase activity has been linked with the disruption of E-cadherin-mediated cellcell adhesion4-6 and also impacts the assembly and turnover of focal adhesions, which are critical for cell migration.7,8 Studies on colon tumors have found that the highest level of c-Src kinase activity occurs in metastatic tissue9,10 and that increased c-Src kinase activity is an indicator of a poor prognosis.11-13 Furthermore, emerging data suggest that c-Src kinase inhibition

may enhance the antitumor efficacy of hormonal and cytotoxic agents in preclinical models.14,15 As well as having a role in solid tumors, c-Src family kinases might be involved in the progression of chronic myeloid and acute lymphoid leukemias (CMLs and ALLs) that are positive for the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+). Studies have shown that c-Src kinases have a function in imatinib-resistant CML and ALL16,17 and that inhibitors of c-Src and Bcr-Abl kinases have activity against both imatinib-sensitive and imatinibresistant cell lines.18 c-Src kinase activity is also implicated in metastatic bone disease, a characteristic of late-stage progression of many solid tumor types, for example, breast19 and prostate,20 and of leukemias.21,22 In animal models, inhibition of c-Src kinase has been shown to limit invasion of bone metastases and destructive bone resorption.23 c-Src kinase has been and still is one of the most studied cellular protein tyrosine kinases, yet no inhibitor has reached the market either for osteoporosis or for cancer by targeting tumor growth, cell adhesion, or motility.24 However, several classes of molecules have been studied preclinically for their ability to inhibit c-Src and Abl kinases,24-26 of which the three most advanced compounds (Figure 1) that are undergoing clinical evaluation are the anilinoquinazoline AZD0530 [N-(5chloro-1,3-benzodioxol-4-yl)-7-[2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethoxy]5-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yloxy)quinazolin-4-amine,27,28 the thiazolecarboxamide BMS-354825,29 and the quinolinecarbonitrile SKI-606.24 AZD0530 (33) is a highly selective, orally available, dualspecific c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor which is in clinical development for the treatment of a wide range of tumor types. On the basis of current knowledge of c-Src kinase activity, 33 is likely to have a therapeutic benefit as an anti-invasive agent, with potential for activity in early and advanced solid tumors, leukemia, and metastatic bone disease. In this paper, we describe

the rationale and structure-activity relationships (SARs) leading to the synthesis of 33. Chemistry The C-5-substituted anilinoquinazolines described in Table 1 were usually prepared by one of the two main routes as described in Schemes 1-7. The general strategies to introduce the C-5 and C-7 substituents on the quinazoline core were based either on the selective dealkylation of the C-5 and/or C-7 methoxy of the (benzyloxy)quinazoline precursors 39, 43, 46, 58, 59, 61-64, 73, 88, 93, 99, and 113 or on the displacement by alkoxide anions of the C-5 and/or C-7 fluorine atom of the fluoroquinazoline intermediates 48, 52, 108, and 109. Displacement of the C-5 fluorine atom of the commercially available quinazolinone 48 by sodium methoxide led to 45 (Scheme 1). Subsequent activation of the C-4 position by POCl3, followed by the nucleophilic displacement of the intermediate 4-chloroquinazoline with 2-chloro-5-methoxyaniline, led to 46. Deprotection of the C-5-methoxy group was achieved by heating with pyridine/HCl to give 47. When the same sequence of reactions was applied to the dimethoxy derivative 43, the last step led to selective deprotection of the more reactive C-5 methoxy substituent over the less reactive C-7 methoxy to give rise to 44. The phenols 44 and 47 were then treated under Mitsunobu conditions with a range of alcohols to give 1, 2, and 4. Alternatively, as shown with the synthesis of 52, the electronwithdrawing property of the C-5 fluorine atom was used to activate the C-4 position of the quinazoline 51 and facilitate the introduction of the 4-amino-5-chloro-1,3-benzodioxole27 to give 52. The C-5 fluorine atom, although less reactive in 52 than in 48, was subsequently displaced by primary or secondary alkoxides in DMF at 80 °C to give 3 and 53. Cleavage of the BOC protecting group of 53 under acidic conditions gave 54, which was then methylated under reductive amination conditions to give 26 (Scheme 1). To achieve a mild and selective deprotection of the C-7 position after having introduced the desired C-5 alkoxy substituent, we prepared the 5,7-bis(benzyloxy)anilinoquinazoline 59 from the isatin precursor 55 (Scheme 2). Treatment of 59 with pyridine/HCl gave the phenol 60, which was then reacted with a range of secondary alcohols under Mitsunobu conditions to give 61-64 with excellent yields. Deprotection of the C-7 benzyloxy protecting group with TFA led to 65-68, and these were then reacted with either 4-(3hydroxypropyl)morpholine30 or 3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propan-1-ol to give 7-10 or 21, respectively. The [(5-chloro-1,3benzodioxolyl)amino]quinazolines were synthesized as described in Schemes 3-6. The dimethoxyquinazolinone 43 was selectively deprotected at the C-5 position using MgBr2/pyridine to

give 71. The selectivity observed for the C-5 position over C-7, is most probably due to an internal coordination of the magnesium atom with the C-4 and C-5 oxygen atoms, favoring a concerted process. Selective protection of the N-3 position of 71 with the POM group led to 72, which was then substituted at C-5 by the tetrahydropyran nucleus. The deprotection of the C-7 methoxy group of 73 required stronger conditions, namely, thiophenol and potassium carbonate in NMP at 195 °C to give the C-7 hydroxyquinazolinone 74. Acylation of the C-7 position allowed subsequent versatile modification of either the C-4 or C-7 substituent to generate 11, 14-16, 18, 19, 25, 33, 41, 42, and 80 after conventional deprotection and Mitsunobu reactions. The 6-chlorobenzodioxanamine31 was prepared and coupled to the quinazolinone 75 (Scheme 3) after in situ activation, as described for the preparation of 77. Compound 120 was then deprotected as described for 77 to give 121, which was subsequently alkylated to give 41 and 42. The synthesis of the C-5 piperidinyloxy derivatives is described in Scheme 4 and utilizes the N-protected quinazolinones 72 and 83. Introduction of the N-methylpiperidinyl moiety or its N-Boc-protected equivalent at the C-5 position gave the key protected precursors 84-87, which were subsequently modified at positions C-4 and C-7 to give 5, 6, 12, 13, 28, 29, 96, and 97. Deprotection under acidic conditions of the BOC protecting group of 97 gave 24. Reductive amination of the secondary piperidine 96 using sodium borohydride triacetate and formaldehyde in acetic acid/ methanol gave the corresponding N-methyl derivative 27. The series of C-5 isopropoxy derivatives was obtained as shown in Scheme 5. The protected quinazolinone 83 was reacted with 2-propanol and subsequently deprotected using ammonia/ methanol in a one-pot process to give 99. Debenzylation followed by acylation at C-7, chlorination at C-4, and displacement of the chlorine by the 4-amino-5-fluoro-1,3-benzodioxole or 4-amino-5-chloro-1,3-benzodioxole gave 101 and 102. Alkylation with 2-chloroethanol gave two chloroalkyl precursors, 103 and 104. Nucleophilic displacement of the aliphatic chlorine atom of 103 and 104 by morpholine and N-acetylpiperazine led, respectively, to 31 and 32. The difluoroquinazolinone 108, prepared from the commercially available 3,5-difluoroaniline, also proved to be a valuable intermediate in our strategies (Scheme 6). Activation of the C-5 fluorine atom by the quinazoline carbonyl group, together with the second fluorine at the C-7 position allowed selective nucleophilic displacement of the C-5 fluorine by morpholine to give 109. Subsequent displacement of the C-7 fluorine atom by the (2-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidine side chain required the formation of an intermediate alkoxide to give 110. Chlorination followed by reaction with the aminobenzodioxole gave 20. The C-5- and C-6-disubstituted derivatives were synthesized as shown in Scheme 7. The 5-hydroxy functionality of 111 was generated from the 5-(benzyloxy)-6-methoxybenzoquinazolone using TFA. Subsequently, the N-3 position of 111 was selectively protected to give 112. Reaction with tetrahydropyran-4-ol or N-methylpiperidin-4-ol led to 113 and 114, respectively. These key intermediate quinazolinones were subsequently processed through conventional functionalization of the C-6 and C-4 positions to give 38 and 40. Results and Discussion For clarity of discussion, data on only a limited, representative set of compounds are used to describe the structure-activity relationships. Where trends are exemplified by a single pair of compounds, it is to be understood that more examples exist to support the SAR described.32

Kinases are important biological targets, and tremendous efforts have been made over the past few years to solve their three-dimensional structures complexed with different classes of inhibitors.33 This has supplied key information, not only on the nature and topology of the ATP binding site, but also on the conformation of their active and inactive forms, revealing something of their complex and varied modes of activation.34-39 Structural studies of kinase complexes have revealed the existence of a pattern of clustered residues and conserved hydrogen bond interactions surrounding the active site, providing a basis for the understanding of the binding of ATP or competitive inhibitors.34,35 The adenine moiety of ATP itself is anchored in the active site by two such bonds as illustrated in Figure 2. This hydrogen bond network has been widely exploited to design purine-mimetic scaffolds and develop novel chemical series of ATP competitive kinase inhibitors27,40-50 as shown in many kinase-inhibitor complexes.45-47,51-54 Although hydrogen bonding is essential for this mode of inhibition, the number of protein-ligand hydrogen bonds is not correlated with potency. Structural studies have also revealed the presence of other pockets within the active site which play important roles in the potency and selectivity of small-molecule inhibitors. One feature frequently exploited in the design of kinase inhibitors is the presence of a deep hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the adenine binding site (Figure 2).41,42,44,46,47,52,56,57 This pocket is made up of conserved and nonconserved residues and is not occupied by ATP itself. While its nature remains mainly hydrophobic,

Schematic representation of ATP bound to the Src kinase domain.36 The binding site is represented by its molecular surface in blue.73 Molecules are illustrated in stick representation with colored elements. The adenine moiety is anchored by one donator and one acceptor H bond with Ty340 and Met341, respectively. Crystal structures of kinase-inhibitor complexes43,50,51,55 have shown that another H bond could also be formed between an H bond donor (HBD) and the backbone carbonyl of a residue equivalent to Met341. The locations of the ATP binding site pockets exploited in drug design are also shown.

its size and shape vary noticeably between kinases and depend on the activation state of the enzyme.36,37,39a,58-60 The residue present at the entrance of this pocket, also known as the

The chlorobenzodioxole moiety of AZD0530 is buried in the hydrophobic pocket. Note that this pocket is not fully occupied by the benzodioxole, in agreement with the fact that this pocket is deeper in the inactivated (c-Src) than in the activated (Lck) form. (b) Stereoview of AZD0530 in the ATP binding site. The molecular surface of the binding site is colored according to the hydrophobicity of the surrounding residues. Yellow areas indicate hydrophobic regions, magenta hydrophilic, and blue and red, respectively, positively and negatively charged residues. The tetrahydropyran ring is seen to pack with a hydrophobic pocket in the ribose binding site. The interactions are predominantly formed with the glycine loop in the N-terminal domain (Leu273, Gly274) and with Leu393 and Ser345 in the C-terminal domain.

gatekeeper, is another key determinant for selective inhibition within a kinase family.44,61,62 We have previously reported that 2-chloro-5-methoxyanilinoquinazolines substituted at the C-6 and C-7 positions of the quinazoline ring (Table 1) display good inhibition of the c-Src kinase enzyme.27 Interestingly, these inhibitors do not occupy the ribose binding site. In this work we investigated a novel series of anilinoquinazolines substituted at the C-5 position of the quinazoline ring. The C-5 position allows substituents to access the ATP ribose binding site and could thus provide additional binding affinity for the enzyme. Unlike the selectivity pocket, the ribose pocket is partially open to the solvent and lined by a series of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues (Figure 2). Modeling and docking of potential inhibitors into our 3D model of c-Src suggested to us that heterocycles linked to the position C-5 of the quinazoline would nicely fit the shape and the chemical nature of the ribose pocket. Other work on CDK1-2 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitors had shown that the ribose pocket could be occupied by a broad range of substituents, including straight or branched alkyl chains, phenyl, or cyclic amines.50a,b,63,64 Despite extensive SAR studies aimed at modifying the quinazoline core, little information was known about the possible beneficial effects of C-5 substitution at the time of initiation of this work. A thorough investigation of the SAR around the substitution at the C-5 position of the quinazoline nucleus was thus made in both the monocyclic 2-chloro-5-methoxyanilinoquinazolines and the bicyclic [(chlorobenzodioxolyl)amino]quinazoline series with the aim of finding suitable substituents

that would optimally fit the ribose pocket and provide additional affinity for the enzyme active site. A wide range of substituents, flexible or rigid, linear or cyclic, neutral or basic, proved to be well tolerated at this C-5 position (Table 1). However, cyclic substituents generally led to more potent enzyme inhibitors than did acyclic, flexible substituents (Table 1; compare 4 and 5), consistent with an accessible ribose pocket of limited dimensions. Oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as the tetrahydropyran-4-yloxy, tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy, and the (N-methylpiperidin-4-yl)oxy rings proved overall to be preferred (Table 1, 5 and 7-10). Comparison of compounds 5 and 22 shows that these C-5 cyclic substituents can improve enzyme affinity by 10-fold over a C-5 hydrogen. When we previously applied this C-5 substitution strategy to the design of novel anilinoquinazoline inhibitors of EGFR-TK (epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase), we observed that a basic group at C-5 was clearly beneficial to sustain good potency,64 probably due to the presence of aspartic residues within the EGF kinase ribose pocket. Unlike that, in c-Src the presence of a basic group at C-5 does not affect potency (compare compounds 1, 4, and 2) despite the fact that the aspartic residues thought to play a role in charge interactions with the EGFR-TK inhibitors are conserved in c-Src (Asp404 in the conserved DFG motif and Asp348). This suggests that the acidic side chains might be orientated differently in these two enzymes and have a different impact on the electrostatic surface surrounding the ribose pocket. From an in-house crystal structure of our best compound 33 complexed with c-Src, the tetrahydropyran ring fits tightly in the ribose pocket (Figure 3). The interactions with the protein are predominantly hydrophobic, and no H-bonding interaction

is observed between the ring oxygen and the ribose pocket. Due to the presence of the bulky chlorobenzodioxole, the side chain of Asp404 is indeed deflected opposite the hydrophobic pocket. Increasing the degree of flexibility of the C-5 substituent as illustrated by the larger and more flexible (N-methylpiperidin4-yl)methoxy substituent (compound 26) or conversely reducing its flexibility as illustrated by the rigid and directly linked morpholinyl substituent (compound 20) sustained a good level of enzyme inhibition, although up to 12-fold lower than that of the corresponding tetrahydropyran-4-yloxy or (N-methylpiperidin-4-yl)oxy equivalent (compare 26 and 3 and 20 and 16). Branched alkyl chains, such as isopropoxy, gave potency equivalent to that of the broad range of tolerated cyclic nuclei, as shown by compounds 6-8, 10, 15, 24, 30, and 36. The improvement in affinity achieved with the C-5 tetrahydropyran is comparable in magnitude to that observed by interaction with the protein through the C-7 position of the quinazoline as shown by the comparison of 22 with 5 and 35. In the C-5 series, investigation of the substitution pattern of the aniline also proved extremely important to help improve the potency of our inhibitors. Bicyclic anilines such as the benzodioxole (compounds 11, 12, and 14) were tolerated,

although they were about 5-fold less potent than the monocyclic 2-chloro-5-methoxyanilines (compare 12 and 5). Expansion of the benzodioxole ring size by one carbon atom as shown by the benzodioxane nucleus retained a good level of c-Src enzyme inhibition (comparison of compounds 12 and 13 and 14 and 17). Interestingly, this result differs significantly from that observed in the C-6, C-7 quinazoline series where the benzodioxane was 26-fold less active than the benzodioxole equivalent.27 This possibly suggests that the C-5 substituent slightly distorts the ATP site of the c-Src enzyme, thus slightly opening up the entrance of the hydrophobic pocket to accommodate the increased size of the benzodioxane ring. Further, introduction of a chlorine atom at the C-6 position of the 2,3-(methylenedioxy)aniline ring (see Table 1) (compare compounds 6, 11, 12, and 14-17), as observed in our previous work,27 also led to a significant improvement in potency of up to 15-fold. The chlorine atom is thought to add to the lipophilic interaction of the compound with an alanine residue within the c-Src kinase selectivity pocket (Ala403), thus increasing the binding affinity (Figure 4). The chlorine substituent can be replaced by bromine without loss in potency.65 Replacement by the smaller halogen fluorine led to a slight but consistent reduction in potency

(compare 31 and 32). A subsequent in-house crystal structure of the benzodioxane derivative 17 in complex with c-Src has provided interesting information. Compound 17 binds similarly to the benzodioxole derivative 33 except that the benzodioxane ring, which occupies the hydrophobic pocket, is rotated by about 180° compared to the chlorobenzodioxole ring. This particular orientation may be necessary to relieve the steric bulk resulting from the larger benzodioxane ring. Interestingly, in this orientation the ethylenedioxy bridge is no longer in the vicinity of the gatekeeper residue (Thr338 in c-Src, Val916 in KDR), which may explain the good potency to KDR and the reduced selectivity. We also noticed that the potency of the C-5-substituted series was again increased by up to 25-fold by the introduction of an electron-donating group (EDG) at the C-7 position of the quinazoline nucleus (compare 1 and 5, 3 and 6, 23 and 24, and 3 and 28). In this C-7 position a large diversity of side chains (basic, heterocyclic, heteroaromatic, neutral, etc.) were tolerated by the enzyme with compounds showing low nanomolar inhibition of c-Src (compounds 15, 18, 19, 23-25, and 2733). Moreover, this region of the molecule is exposed to the solvent and thus proved to be ideal to anchor flexible side chains

bearing solubilizing groups to not only enhance the in vitro potency but also optimize the physicochemical properties of this series.55,66 Interestingly, the improvement in potency achieved with the additional C-7 substituent proved to some extent to be dependent on its relative basicity (compare 5 and 1, 7 and 2, and 2 and 21). Steric hindrance near the quinazoline was disfavored as indicated by the 10-25-fold reduction in potency observed with the isopropoxy derivative 27 compared with unbranched side chains, as illustrated by 6, 28, and 29. If a second EDG is introduced at the C-6 position (ortho relative to that at C-5), the activity of the resulting compound is reduced by 17-100-fold compared with that of the C-5, C-7 isomer (compare 5 and 38 and 21 and 40). This can probably be explained by a conformational effect in which the relative peri and ortho relations of the C-4, C-5, and C-6 substituents forces the C-5 substituent to be oriented slightly out of the plane of the quinazoline and thus induces unfavorable positioning or steric contacts within the ribose pocket. Kinase Selectivity. Selectivity for c-Src over other tyrosine kinases was one of our major objectives to optimize the tolerance profile of our inhibitors. As shown by the 2-chloro-5methoxyanilinoquinazoline 5, the C-5 series proved very selec-

tive for c-Src over VEGFR-2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, also known as KDR) (c-Src/KDR IC50 ratio >70fold). We had previously reported that in the binding to KDR and c-Src of our C-6,C-7-disubstituted quinazoline-based inhibitors27 the quinazoline ring is sandwiched between the N- and C-terminal domains of the kinase and forms a number of hydrophobic contacts (Figure 4). The exploitation of the hydrophobic pocket had led us to design and develop the selective (4-aminobenzodioxolyl)quinazoline series.27 In the C-6,C-7-disubstituted quinazoline series, the 6-H-benzodioxolamine fits particularly well into the hydrophobic pocket, providing an excellent increase in selectivity over that of the monocyclic 2-chloro-5-methoxyaniline, in particular versus KDR.27 The increase in selectivity between c-Src and KDR observed in the C-6, C-7 series had been rationalized by the presence of a threonine at the entrance of the selectivity pocket in c-Src (Thr338), which gives more favorable contacts with the benzodioxole oxygens than the corresponding Val916 present in KDR.27,67 In contrast to what we reported in the C-6, C-7 series,27 the 6-H-benzodioxole aniline unexpectedly led to a 5-10-fold reduction in selectivity for c-Src over KDR

compared with the monocyclic aniline as shown by the comparison of 12 and 5 and 11 and 7. In the C-5 series, as previously suggested for the c-Src enzyme, the size of this C-5 substituent probably distorts slightly the entrance of the hydrophobic/selectivity pocket of KDR, thus minimizing the differences between the two enzymes and leading to a reduced selectivity. As a direct consequence of the benzodioxane ring fitting KDR quite well in the C-5 quinazoline series, the selectivity of these benzodioxane derivatives for c-Src over KDR was reduced by 6-20-fold compared with that of the corresponding benzodioxole (compare 14 and 17 and 12 and 13). An improvement in selectivity was achieved in the C-5substituted benzodioxole series by the introduction of the 6chlorine atom as shown by the comparison of compounds 14 and 16 and 11 and 15 (Figure 4). The chlorine lies in a hydrophobic groove within the selectivity pocket, lined by an alanine residue in c-Src (Ala403), whereas this residue is a sterically and electronically less favorable cysteine in KDR. Overall this series proved to deliver excellent selectivity for c-Src inhibition over KDR inhibition as shown by the KDR/c-

Src IC50 ratios (62-fold to >7000-fold) of compounds 6, 15, 16, 18, 19, 23-25, and 28-33 (Table 1).

As shown in Table 4, this class of compounds proved to be very selective against a range of kinases including cell cycle

kinases such as CDK2 and Aurora as well as antiproliferative receptor and nonreceptor kinases such as EGFR-TK and MEK. They also proved to be selective over Csk, the natural inactivator of c-Src as demonstrated by compounds 15 and 33 (Csk/c-Src IC50 ratios, respectively, >70-fold and 310-fold).

other c-Src kinase family members and c-Src-related kinases such as c-Yes and Lck as well as v-Abl (Table 4). The kinase selectivity profile of 33 is representative of this series of molecules and demonstrates potent dual-specific inhibition of c-Src and Abl kinases. The functional redundancy demonstrated in mouse gene knockout experiments among the ubiquitously expressed SFKs c-Src, Yes, and Fyn coupled with emerging evidence suggestive of similar mechanisms in cancer cells suggests a pan SFK selective agent, such as AZD0530, might be the profile required to ensure maximum inhibition of SFK activity in cancer cells and tissues. It is anticipated a pan SFK inhibitor could impact aspects of the immune cell function. Although we have not seen evidence of this in preclinical studies with AZD0530, active monitoring for immune cell and immune function effects of the drug is being carried out in man. In Vitro Cellular Activity. Inhibition of c-Src activity in cells was evaluated in mouse NIH 3T3 cells transfected with constitutively active human c-Src. The C-5-substituted anilinoquinazoline series showed good permeability through cell membranes (15, PA-B > 1 × 106 cm/s; 33, PA-B > 30 × 106 cm/s), and consequently, an inhibition of c-Src at concentrations below 10 nM in the enzyme assay translated into inhibition of the c-Src-transfected NIH 3T3 cell proliferation at concentrations below 100 nM. Inhibition of in vitro random cell motility (chemokinesis) was measured by the ability of compounds to prevent the migration of human lung tumor cells (A549 NSCLC) suspended in an agarose microdroplet. In this assay the activity of this series of molecules was consistently submicromolar and again mirrored the potency found in the enzyme assay. Compound 33 displayed IC50 values of 76 nM in the prolifera-

tion assay (c-Src-transfected NIH3T3 cells) and 140 nM in the migration assays (A549 cells). The inhibition of migration cannot be attributed to a direct antiproliferative effect on the A549 cells in view of the weak antiproliferative activity of 33 on these cells (IC50 ) 14 ( 1.5 µM (n ) 4)). Cellular activity against Abl was evaluated in K562 cells (human line CML). 33 displayed in vitro antiproliferative IC50 values of 220 nM (n ) 3) in K562 (WT Ph+) cells. Paxillin is a direct substrate of c-Src and is an adaptor/ scaffolding protein thought to be essential in linking newly formed focal adhesions to the actin cytoskeleton. This link helps provide the contractile forces required for cell motility. Measurement of paxillin phosphorylation in tumor cells provides a reliable in vitro mechanistic measure of c-Src activity, which is linked to the adhesion/motility signaling pathway. Compounds of this series displayed good activity in this assay,68 and in particular 33 inhibited paxillin phosphorylation in vitro in A549 cells by 70% at a concentration of 1 µM (measured by Western blot). Moreover, the excellent selectivity observed for these compounds at the kinase enzyme level was confirmed in cell assays against selected targets with representatives of the series.68 Physicochemical Properties and DMPK. As illustrated by compounds 19 and 31, the solubility of almost neutral [(6chlorobenzodioxolyl)amino]quinazolines is moderate at physiological pH (Table 3). We had shown previously that the solubility of anilinoquinazolines could be improved by the introduction of a basic nitrogen.66 Introduction of basic side chains at either the C-5 or the C-7 position of the quinazoline core led to a very significant (>500-fold) increase in solubility

when measured at pH 7.4 by virtue of protonation of the basic moiety. Even with moderately basic C-7 substituents such as (N-methylpiperazinyl)ethoxy (compound 33, pKa ) 7.9), the solubility increased very significantly compared with that of their neutral counterparts (comparison of compounds 33 and 19). Moreover, the basic function led to a 5-15-fold increase in the fraction unbound in the plasma of these derivatives as illustrated by compounds 6, 15, and 33 over 19 and 31. To design compounds to incorporate good oral bioavailability amenable for chronic oral administration, we paid particular attention to the molecular properties that have been reported to affect absorption such as the total polar surface area (PSA), molecular weight (MW), H-bond donor-acceptor (HBDA) properties, and number of rotatable bonds.69 Our C-5 derivatives were designed to possess moderate PSA and a minimum number of rotatable bonds. This approach led us to design compounds with excellent exposure as shown by the total area under the curve (AUC0-24 h) in mice following oral administration (Table 5). However, all the C-5-substituted subseries are not equivalent

with regard to their ADME properties. Of the two main subseries, the C-5 tetrahydropyranyl one (compounds 15 and 16) always demonstrated significantly higher oral exposure than the C-5 piperidine one (compounds 6, 24, and 29) despite the excellent Lipinski properties69 and moderate pKa of the latter (compound 6, Table 3). The difference between the two C-5 subseries was suggested to be due to reduced permeability and increased efflux properties of the C-5 N-methylpiperidine series. In the C-5 tetrahydropyranyl series, absorption is good and excellent exposure is achieved even when basic side chains are present at C-7 as shown by compounds 15 (pKa ) 9.5) and 18 (pKa ) 9.4). The C-5-substituted series compares very favorably from an ADME properties point of view with the C-6,C-7disubstituted series we previously reported (comparison of 15 and 18 and 34 and 37). As shown in Table 2, anilinoquinazolines bearing basic functions can display large volumes of distribution (Vd) which tend to lead to long half-lives (15, 18, 35) when combined with moderate to low clearance.66 Similarly to what was observed in the C6,C-7-disubstituted anilinoquinazolines, we have shown that in this C-5, C-7 series, the modulation of the pKa of the side chain (at C-5 or C-7) correlated generally well with the Vd (Figure 5) for compounds displaying moderate clearance and quite similar unbound fractions in plasma. This in turn permitted a relatively precise control of the t1/2 of the final molecule. Moreover, we identified that the pKa of the side chain was also playing an important role with regard to the affinity for the hERG receptor of our compounds. Very basic compounds proved to have more affinity for this receptor than less basic or neutral ones. With its moderate pKa (7.9), compound 33 displayed very low affinity for the hERG channel.

33 in the NIH3T3 model, this suggested that 33 should also prevent formation of metastasis in vivo. We also demonstrated that AZD0530 prevents the formation of lymph node metastasis in a bladder model (NBT-II) and liver metastasis in an orthotopic L3.6 human pancreatic tumor model.68,72 Moreover, in an orthotopic model of human pancreas (BxPC-3 cells), athymic mice treated with 33, given orally once daily at doses of 25 (mg/kg)/d for more than 50 days, demonstrated a significant 38% (p < 0.05) increase in survival compared with control animals which may, in part, be attributable to an anti-invasive activity in this aggressive orthotopic tumor model.85 Conclusions C-5-substituted (benzodioxolylamino)quinazolines are potent and dual-specific inhibitors of c-Src and Abl kinases. Their enzyme inhibition profiles translate very well into activity in cells in vitro in terms of inhibition of both proliferation and cell migration. The presence of a moderately basic side chain at the C-7 position confers excellent physicochemical properties, in particular good aqueous solubility and moderate binding to plasma proteins. The C-5 tetrahydropyranyl series possesses good pharmacokinetic properties and demonstrates appropriate exposure following oral administration to rodents and dogs. These properties, combined with good intrinsic potencies, led to good in vivo activity in a range of preclinical models. The full exploitation of our knowledge of the shape, size, and properties of the different binding sites of c-Src and KDR and of the best fit substituents led to the design of 33 (AZD0530). 33 displays potent c-Src enzyme inhibition (IC50 ) 2.7 nM) and excellent selectivity for c-Src over KDR (7740-fold). In view of its good physicochemical properties, selectivity profile, pharmacokinetics, and activity in preclinical models, compound 33 was selected for further development and is currently undergoing phase I clinical evaluation in patients with advanced cancers. Experimental Section
All experiments were carried out under an inert atmosphere and at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Flash chromatography was carried out on Merck Kieselgel 50 (Art. 9385). The purities of compounds for biological testing were assessed by analytical HPLC on a Hichrom S5ODS1 Spherisorb column system set to run isocratically with 60-70% MeOH + 0.2% CF3COOH in water as eluent. Purification by preparative HPLC/MS was performed on a Waters LC/MS system using a Waters Symmetry column (C18, 5 µm, 19 mm diameter, 100 mm length) with a mixture of water (containing 1% acetic acid) and acetonitrile (gradient from 5% to 100%) as solvent. NMR spectra were obtained on a JEOL JNM EX 400 (400 MHz) spectrometer and Bruker Avance 500 (500 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shifts are expressed in  (ppm) units, and peak multiplicities are expressed as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets; t, triplet; br s, broad singlet; m, multiplet. Mass spectrometry was carried out on an analytical Waters LC/MS system with positive and negative ion data collected automatically. NMR and mass spectra were run on isolated intermediates and final products and were consistent with the proposed structures. For the microanalysis, all the adducts mentioned were measured: water was assayed by the Karl-Fisher method using a Mettler DL 18, the HCl content was determined on a Metrohm 686 by titration using silver nitrate solution, and organic adducts were measured by 1H NMR.

Figure 6. Inhibition of an Src-transfected 3T3 tumor xenograft following daily oral administration of AZD0530.

When tested in animal models over a range of doses, 33 did not display modification of the ECG nor prolongation of the QT interval of ECGs.65 Compound 33 represented a good compromise among moderate pKa, leading to excellent bioavailability and general ADME properties in preclinical species (Table 2), low affinity for hERG, and good physicochemical properties. The pharmacokinetic profiles of 33 observed in rat and dog (Table 2) were subsequently confirmed in man and proved consistent with once daily oral dosing with a mean terminal half-life at steady-state of 40 h (range 32-47) and low interpatient variability.70 In Vivo Activity. Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts engineered to overexpress a deregulated, constitutively active form of human c-Src have a phenotype altered from that of the wild-type parental line. In vivo, the transfected cell line grows subcutaneously to form tumors in athymic rats and mice, while the wildtype 3T3 cells do not. Implanted subcutaneously in athymic rats, the transfected lines develop large tumors in approximately 3 weeks. Animals treated with 15 orally once daily at doses of 10 (mg/kg)/d for 18 days show 90% inhibition of tumor volume, while animals treated with 33 orally (Figure 6) once daily at doses of 6 (mg/kg)/d for 18 days show >95% inhibition of tumor volume and tumor weight at the end of the experiment. The activity observed in this model is unlikely to be due to a direct inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. As expected from its very weak activity against VEGFR-2, 33 does not inhibit the in vitro VEGF- or FGF-stimulated growth of HUVECs (VEGFHUVEC and FGF-HUVEC IC50 > 5 µM (n ) 4)) and was shown to be inactive in in vivo angiogenesis assays.65 Moreover, inhibition of paxillin phosphorylation at tyrosine Y31 as well as FAK (focal adhesion kinase) tyrosine phosphorylation demonstrated in vitro was confirmed in vivo. More than 80% inhibition of both paxillin and FAK phosphorylation has been demonstrated in Calu-6 xenograft tumors 6 h post last dose following oral administration of 20 (mg/kg)/d of 33.68 In this xenograft model 33 is more active than our previously reported 2-chloro,5-methoxyanilinoquinazoline derivative 35 (M475271) and delivers complete inhibition of tumor growth at 1/10 of the dose required by 35 to achieve the same effect.27 c-Src is overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and we have previously reported that 35 prevented the formation of metastasis in an orthotopic L3.6pl human pancreatic tumor model. Untreated animals developed liver metastasis within a few weeks, whereas complete inhibition of liver metastasis formation was achieved with once daily oral administration of 25 (mg/kg)/d of 35.71 Combined with the superior activity of

A mixture of 116 (700 mg, 2.7 mmol), acetic anhydride (10 mL), and pyridine (700 µL) was heated at 100 °C for 1 h. After evaporation the residue was taken up in a mixture of methanol (9 mL) and water (9 mL) and the resulting mixture stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The formed precipitate was filtered off, and methanol evaporation gave a second crop after filtration.

Biological Evaluation. IC50 values reported are means of at least three to five measurements. (i) In vitro Src Kinase Inhibition Test. This assay determines the ability of test compounds to inhibit c-Src kinase activity. The method is as reported previously.27 (ii) In vitro Abl Kinase Inhibition Test. This assay determines the ability of test compounds to inhibit Abl kinase activity. A poly(Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1 random copolymer (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, U.K.) was used as the tyrosine-containing substrate. It was stored as a 2 mg/mL stock solution in PBS at -20 °C and diluted 1:1000 with PBS to coat 96-well plates (100 µL/well). The substrate was plated the day before an assay, and the plates were covered with adhesive seals and stored overnight at 4 °C. On the day of the assay the substrate solution was discarded, and the plates were then incubated with 120 µL/well of 5% BSA in PBS/A for 10 min. The plates were then washed once with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20) and then incubated with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) at 100 µL/well until the next stage. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM. A dilution series was then made in doubly distilled H2O to give solutions at 4 times the final required reaction concentrations. Solutions of 12 µM ATP in 80 mM MgCl2 and 80 mM MgCl2 alone (for -ve controls) were prepared. Abl protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) is a truncated form (45 kDa) of v-Abl PTK and is identical to the normal c-Abl PTK. Abl isolated from a strain of E. coli cells carrying the Abl kinase catalytic domain encoded

by the Abelson murine leukemia virus under the control of a T7 expression system (New England BioLabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA) was diluted to 40 U/mL in enzyme dilution buffer (100 mM HEPES, 2 mM DTT, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.02% BSA). The HEPES was discarded from the substrate plates, and the following additions were made in order, 25 µL/well compound dilution (water in the case of +ve and -ve controls), 25 µL/well of ATP/MgCl2 or MgCl2 (-ve controls) alone, and finally 50 µL/well of Abl kinase in dilution buffer to start the reaction. The final reaction concentrations were 20 U/mL Abl kinase, 20 mM MgCl2, and 3 µM ATP (determined as the Km for ATP). The reaction time allowed was 22 min at room temperature on a plate shaker. The assay was stopped by washing the plates four times with PBST (150 µL/well). Detection of the resultant tyrosine phosphorylation was facilitated by the addition of an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (anti-pY/HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., California); this was diluted 1:5000 in PBST/ B/O (PBST + 0.5% BSA + 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate), added at 100 µL/well, and incubated for 1 h. The plates were again washed (7×). One tablet of the HRP substrate 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 100 µL of DMSO and added per 10 mL of phosphate/citrate buffer with sodium perborate (supplied as soluble capsules, Sigma-Aldrich). TMB substrate solution (100 µL/well) was added. After 5 min of color development the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 µL/well of 0.8 M H2SO4, and the positive control wells gave an A450 nm of ca. 1.21.5. Control and blank wells were included on all plates, containing compound diluent and MgCl2 solution with and without ATP, respectively, to determine the dynamic range of the assay. The curves were plotted, and the IC50 values for compound enzyme inhibition were interpolated using KC3 Kineticalc software (BioTek Instruments) following subtraction of the blank values. (iii) In Vitro KDR Kinase Inhibition Test. This assay determines the ability of test compounds to inhibit KDR kinase activity. The method is as reported previously.48 (iv) Other in Vitro Kinase Inhibition Test. Flt-4 tyrosine kinase was obtained from ProQinase GmbH (Freiburg, Germany) and c-Kit tyrosine kinase from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Each additional kinase used was generated as a cell lysate, following infection of insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses containing kinase domains. All enzyme assays were run at, or just below, the respective Km for ATP (0.2-30 µmol/L). The inhibitory activity of the compounds was determined against a range of recombinant tyrosine kinases [CSK, c-Yes, LCK, Flt-1, Flt-4, c-Kit, PDGFR-R, PDGFR- , FGFR1, Abl, epidermal EGFR, and Aur-B] using ELISA methodology described previously.48 Selectivity versus CDK2 serine/threonine kinase was examined using scintillation proximity assays with a retinoblastoma substrate and [-33P]ATP.66b Activity versus the dual-specificity kinase MAPK kinase (MEK) was determined with a MAPK substrate, [-33P]ATP, and paper capture/ scintillation counting.66b Microcal Origin software (v. 3.78, Microcal Software, Inc., Northhampton, MA) was used to interpolate IC50 values by nonlinear regression. (v) In Vitro c-Src 3T3 Proliferation Assay. This assay determines the ability of test compounds to inhibit the proliferation in culture of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells transfected to overexpress active c-Src kinase. The method is as reported previously.27 (vi) In Vitro K562 Proliferation Assay. These assays determine the ability of test compounds to inhibit the proliferation of cells in culture. The cells used were K-562, a human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line, ATCC No. CCl-243. The K562 suspension cell line was maintained at between 105 and 106 cells/mL in phenol red free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), and 50 mM HEPES. For assay the cells were plated into 96-well plates at 5000 cells/ 90 µL of the indicated growth medium per well. One extra plate designated the "predose plate" was also made at this time. After 2 h the cells were dosed with 10 µL/well of compound solution. (The compounds were stored in stock concentrations of 10mM in 100% DMSO.) The dilutions ensure that the final concentration of DMSO

in each assay well is 0.1% and that the final compound concentration in the assay wells ranges between 10 and 0.00 15µM. MTS reagent (20 µL) (no. G1111/2, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was then added to the predose plate, and after a 2 h incubation the plate was read (as indicated below). After a further 72 h 20 µL of MTS reagent was added to all the remaining wells. After a 2 h incubation, 25 µL of 10% SDS was added to the wells. Then the plates were read at A490 nm. Only the inner 60 wells of the 96-well plates were used in this assay to minimize edge effects. The outer wells were filled with sterile PBS during the course of the assay to help prevent any evaporation. The average absorbance of the predose plate was subtracted from the later plate readings in determining the results. (vii) In Vitro A549 Microdroplet Migration (Chemokinesis) Assay. This assay determines the ability of test compounds to inhibit the random motility (chemokinesis) of A549 cells (human epithelial lung carcinoma cells, ATCC CCL 185). The method is as reported previously.27 (viii) Pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics were determined in mouse, rat, and dog following single intravenous or oral doses (doses described in Tables 2 and 6) of the compound. For the iv studies, the compounds were formulated in a mixture of 25% (w/ v) (hydroxypropyl)- -cyclodextrin/Sorenson's phosphate buffer (pH 5.5). For the oral studies, the compounds were formulated as a solution in either 1% polysorbate or 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 3). (ix) Rat Xenografts. This assay determines the ability of the test compound to inhibit the growth of c-Src-transfected 3T3 cells implanted subcutaneously following once daily oral administration. The method is as reported previously.27 (x) BxPC-3 Orthotopic Model. Female athymic nude NMRI / mice (Bioservices, The Netherlands) were orthotopically inoculated with human pancreatic tumor cells (BxPC-3) at day 0. The mice were treated by gavage (25 mg/kg of AZD0530 daily). The first oral treatment was administered 1 h prior to inoculation of the human pancreatic (BxPC-3) tumor cells and treatment continued thereafter until sacrifice. The primary outcome for AZD0530 activity was prolongation of survival, evaluated by two separate means. First, the percentage T/C (survival) was calculated by dividing the median day of sacrifice in the treated group "T" by the median day of sacrifice in the control group "C" and multiplying that number by 100. In this model, a T/C value >130% indicates a significant prolongation of survival when compared with the survival of the vehicle-treated control group. Second, the effect of AZD0530 was evaluated by conducting a Kaplan-Meier analysis with the cutoff level of significance (log-rank statistics) set at a p value of <0.05. Solubility Measurements. The thermodynamic solubility of a research compound is measured under standard conditions. A known amount of compound is stirred in 0.1 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer at constant temperature (25 °C) for 24 h. The supernatant is then separated from undissolved material by double centrifugation and subsequently analyzed and quantified against a standard of known concentration in DMSO using generic HPLC-UV methodology coupled with mass spectral peak identification. Molecular Modeling. To be consistent with our enzymatic assay, which targets the activated form of c-Src kinase, initial modeling and docking studies of the kinase domain were performed using the crystal structure of activated Lck as a surrogate for Src.74 Indeed, our in-house crystal structures of c-Src contain the SH2, SH3, and kinase domains in an inactivated form, as do published structures of c-Src. They differ from the closely related kinase Lck, which is published as the isolated and activated kinase domain.79 Notable structural differences have been observed in the size of the hydrophobic pocket, which is deeper in the inactive form than in the active one,36 although the shape of the sugar pocket is not significantly different. These observations supported the choice of the Lck structure as a model for activated c-Src. Our inhibitors were built using Quanta, and the charges were assigned by the Quanta charge template method.80,81 These inhibitors were docked manually into the ATP binding site, and the most relevant solutions were then energy minimized with the CHARMm force field to relieve possible unfavorable contacts.82

Crystallography. Protein and crystals were prepared following Xu et al.79 with minor modifications in crystallization. Crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 15 °C, combining 1.5 µL of reservoir solution (50 mM PIPES (pH 6.5), 10 mM DTT, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 4-9% PEG4000 (w/v)) with 1.5 µL of protein-inhibitor solution (made by mixing 10 µL of 10 mg/mL protein with 1.4 µL of 20 mM inhibitor dissolved in 10 mM PIPES (pH 6.5) and 20% DMSO, adjusted so that pH > 4.0). Crystals appeared within 48 h and were cryoprotected by being dipped into 50 mM PIPES (pH 6.5), 20% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.1 M sodium chloride, 10 mM DTT, and 22.5% glycerol before being cooled to 100 K. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a ) 49.81 Å, b ) 72.47 Å, and c ) 171.57 Å, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were recorded at the ESRF (Grenoble), beamline ID14-4, on an ADSC Quantum4R CCD detector. Data were integrated with the program MOSFLM.83 CCP4 programs84 were used for subsequent data analysis. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the published structure of c-Src.79 Model building used QUANTA2000 (Accelrys), and refinement was to R ) 20.5% (Rfree ) 27.6%). The final statistics are given in Table 6. Thr523 and Glu524 were modeled as Ala because of poor side chain density. The coordinates are deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2H8H.
