We report the 1.1-Å resolution crystal structure of a bulky rhodium complex bound to two different DNA sites, mismatched and matched in the oligonucleotide 5 -(dCGGAAATTCCCG)2-3 . At the AC mismatch site, the structure reveals ligand insertion from the minor groove with ejection of both mismatched bases and elucidates how destabilized mispairs in DNA may be recognized. This unique binding mode contrasts with major groove intercalation, observed at a matched site, where doubling of the base pair rise accommodates stacking of the intercalator. Mass spectral analysis reveals different photocleavage products associated with the two binding modes in the crystal, with only products characteristic of mismatch binding in solution. This structure, illustrating two clearly distinct binding modes for a molecule with DNA, provides a rationale for the interrogation and detection of mismatches.

which mismatch repair proteins as well as base-excision repair proteins may interrogate DNA to find damage. These proteins have the remarkable task of finding the rare occurrences of DNA mispairs and base lesions despite their low copy number, yet the mechanism by which they do so remains to be established (13). In particular, it is debated whether proteins that repair damaged bases search for them by actively flipping out every base consecutively (13, 14), capturing a lesioned base pair that is transiently extrahelical because of its instability (15, 16), or in some manner sensing the damage without extruding the bases (17­20). With unmodified bases that simply are mispaired, extrahelical searches are still more difficult to understand. Results and Discussion To improve our understanding of the structural basis for targeting mispaired sites, -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 was cocrystallized with a self-complementary oligonucleotide containing two AC mismatches (5 -C1G2G3A4A5A6T7T8C9C10C11G12-3 ) for highresolution x-ray structure determination by the single anomalous diffraction technique (Table 1). The structure, obtained at atomic resolution (1.1 Å), reveals two different binding modes of the metal complex: (i) site-specific insertion via the minor groove at the mismatch site with ejection of the two bases and (ii) intercalation via the major groove at a matched site (Fig. 1). Although there now are many examples where a single base is flipped out of the DNA duplex, the structure reported here represents an example of insertion of a molecule in DNA with ejection of a base pair.
Minor Groove Insertion at a Mismatched Site. At the thermodynam-

oncomplementary base pairs, or mismatches, within DNA occur during its synthesis via nucleotide misincorporation, inclusion of chemically damaged nucleotides, or inclusion of an undamaged nucleotide opposite a damaged one within the template strand. If left uncorrected, these mismatches lead to mutations upon DNA replication. DNA polymerases generate mismatches at the rate of 10 4 to 10 5 per base pair at the nucleotide insertion step (1). These mistakes typically are reduced to 10 7 per base pair per replication by exonucleases associated with the DNA polymerase and further are reduced 50- to 1,000-fold by the mismatch repair machinery. Deficiencies in mismatch repair increase the rate of mutation and subsequently the risk of developing cancer (2­5). We have designed rhodium complexes that recognize these sites with high selectivity. Octahedral metal complexes that bind by intercalation previously have been prepared with a range of site selectivities (6). In the case of mismatches, the selectivity is attained (7) with the use of an extended intercalating ligand, such as 5,6-chrysenequinone diimine (chrysi), that is wider than the span of a base pair in normal B form DNA (Fig. 1). Photoexcitation of the rhodium complex cleaves the DNA sugar backbone near the mismatch site. [Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 , for instance, can specifically target a single mismatch in a 2,725-bp plasmid (8). Furthermore, the rhodium complex recognizes and cleaves 80% of mismatch sites in all possible single-base sequence contexts around the mispaired bases (9). These quantitative photocleavage titrations have established that the mismatch-specific binding constants correlate strongly with independent measurements of the thermodynamic destabilization of the mispaired bases. The high specificity of the metal complex in targeting mismatches has led to the application of [Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 in the discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (10). The complex also selectively inhibits the proliferation of mismatch repair-deficient cells. This unique cell selectivity provides a basis for a strategy for chemotherapeutic design (11, 12). Furthermore, the binding characteristics of the bulky rhodium complex offer a unique opportunity to explore mechanisms by

ically destabilized site, -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 inserts in the DNA via the minor groove and ejects both mismatched bases from the double helix (Fig. 2). The mismatched cytosine is extruded into the major groove, where it is positioned in proximity and perpendicular to the -stacked bases of the helix. In contrast, the ejected mismatched adenosine remains in the minor groove, likely as a result of crystal packing. Indeed, the mismatched adenosine -stacks both with a bpy ancillary ligand of a rhodium complex inserted in the mismatch site of a crystallographically related DNA and with the adenosine ejected from that same helix. The ejection of the mismatched bases certainly supports

-stacks fully with the flanking AT base pair and with the pyrimidine of the flanking CG base pair; the guanine -stacks only partially with the chrysi ligand. The chrysi ligand is inserted so deeply in the DNA that it protrudes through the DNA such that it is partially accessible by solvent from the major groove. At this site, the rhodium atom is only 4.7 Å from the helix axis, as compared with the 10-Å radius of B-DNA. Insertion of the metal complex from the minor groove results only in small conformational changes in the oligonucleotide and is accommodated mainly through opening of the phosphate backbone. Significantly, all sugars maintain C2 -endo puckering, and all bases, including the ejected ones, maintain an anti configuration (Tables 2 and 3). The flanking base pairs neither stretch nor shear. Other distortions we observed included buckling and staggering of the external flanking base pairs, which also were observed with the 9,10-phenanthrenequinone diimine (phi) major groove intercalators (21). Our previous studies on metallointercalators have shown that matching the chirality of the metal complex with that of DNA significantly enhances the binding affinity (22­24). As a result, only the enantiomer of [Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 cleaves mismatched DNA; no reaction with DNA is observed after photolysis of the enantiomer (7). This enantioselectivity also has been correlated with the higher cytotoxicity of -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 observed in mismatch repair-deficient cell lines as compared with the enantiomer (12). Interestingly, for major groove metallointercalators bound to well matched B-DNA, enantiospecificity is achieved only with complexes containing more bulky ancillar y ligands such as for [Rh(5,5 -diphenyl-2,2 bipyridyl)2phi]3 (24), yet here it is observed with the smaller bpy ligand. The deep insertion of the rhodium complex within the minor groove without an increase in base pair rise provides a structural basis for this enantiospecificity. For insertion from the minor groove into a mismatched site, replacing the enantiomer with the isomer in such a way that the chrysi ligand still -stacked with the flanking base pairs resulted in significant steric conflict between the ancillary bipyridine ligand and the sugar-phosphate backbone.

at the central matched site in a manner similar to that observed for - -[Rh[(R,R)-Me2trien]phi]3 specifically intercalated in a 5 -TGCA-3 site (21); the interaction between the intercalating aromatic ligand and the -orbitals of the bases closely resembles stacking of consecutive base pairs in a DNA duplex. The DNA accommodates the chrysi ligand by opening its phosphate backbone, which results in a doubling of the rise, as well as buckling and staggering of the bases flanking the ligand (Table 3). Although the intercalating chrysi is 0.5 Å wider than the span of a base pair in B form DNA, no shear or stretch was observed in the neighboring base pairs. Furthermore, unlike the phi ligand, which preferentially -stacks with purines, the chrysi ligand is wide enough to completely overlay with both the purines and pyrimidines of the flanking base pairs. The chrysi ligand does not intercalate as deeply in the major groove as does the phi ligand. Superposition of the structures of the two DNA/metallointercalator complexes indicated that the rhodium atom of - -[Rh[(R,R)-Me2trien]phi]3 is 1.2 Å closer to the helix axis than that of -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 .

central 5 -AATT-3 step of the oligonucleotide from its major groove. In this central site, the rhodium complex intercalates in two different orientations, located on a crystallographic twofold axis, resulting in four rhodium residues of equivalent occupancies. This intercalation has not been detected in solution studies with the rhodium complex and likely is favored by crystal packing. Each ancillary bpy ligand of this central rhodium complex -stacks with the terminal CG base pair of two crystallographically related oligonucleotides (Fig. 3). Significantly, this crystal packing provides a direct comparison of two distinct binding modes for the metallointercalator. The complex -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 intercalates in the major groove

complexes are potent photooxidants, this photochemistry has been exploited in marking sites of binding on the DNA duplex (6). -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 specifically cleaves neighboring the mismatch site and, perhaps not surprisingly, with a different product profile than that observed with a major groove intercalator, [Rh(bpy)(phi)2]3 (26, 27). Irradiation of the oligonucleotidebound metal complex at 365 nm in solution yielded three oxidation products. A first cleavage product, typical of DNA damage, is observed at m/z 2,802 and corresponds to a 9-mer DNA with a 3 -phosphate terminus (Fig. 5). Two unusual products, which are assigned to a furanone derivative (m/z 2,898) and a fragment containing a 2,3-dehydronucleotide terminus (m/z 2,991), characteristically are found after reaction with -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 bound to mismatched DNA but are not observed with major groove

ium complex itself distorts in a similar manner both upon intercalation and insertion in the DNA (Fig. 4). Most notably, in the Rh-DNA complex, the chrysi ligand flattens so as to better -stack with the flanking base pair regardless of the binding mode. In the rhodium complex, the bending of the chrysi ligand is attributed to the steric hindrance between the protonated imine and the hydrogens of C25 and C37 (25). It is possible that in the intercalated complex, the two imines are deprotonated, thus enabling the chrysi ligand to flatten. The ancillary bpy ligands also are sufficiently flexible to bend within the groove so as to better accommodate the sugar-phosphate backbone. To insert inside the minor groove, the two bpy ligands bend 26° and 12°. Similarly, intercalation in the major groove obliges the two bpys to distort 34° and 19°.

intercalators. A second MALDI-TOF mass measurement after 48 h at ambient temperature showed complete conversion of the fragment containing a 2,3-dehydronucleotide terminus (m/z 2,991) to the phosphate-modified oligonucleotide. In solution, no DNA cleavage was seen for the chrysi complex with matched DNA. A 2 -deoxyribonolactone, corresponding to the loss of a cytosine base, also appeared at m/z 3,534. Importantly, the photooxidation products directly reflect access of the metal complex to the major or the minor groove of the DNA and can thus be used to assess its binding mode. Strand cleavage via the minor groove is associated with abstraction of H1 , H4 , or H5 of the deoxyribose ring (28). In the case of -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 , the furanone and the 2,3-dehydronucleotide fragments observed after cleavage at the mismatch site were similar to those of [Cu(phen)2] , a minor groove binder that reacts with DNA via H1 abstraction (29, 30). It is noteworthy that the base propenal and oligonucleotide 3 phosphoglycolate products characteristic of H4 abstraction, such as with iron bleomycin, were not observed with the bulky rhodium complex (31, 32). The present structure indicates that insertion of the metal complex via the minor groove positions the Cchrysi34 2.7 Å). bulky ligand in closest proximity to H1 (H1 The structure thus corroborates a mechanism for DNA strand

cleavage at the mismatch site, where the first step involves H1 abstraction with subsequent degradation of the deoxyribose ring. Note that -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 does not cleave DNA directly at the mismatch site but one base away from the mismatch in the 3 direction and on the 5 strand only. In the oligonucleotide crystallized, for instance, cleavage does not occur at the mismatched cytosine but at its flanking pyrimidine (Fig. 5). The present structure provides an explanation for this observation as well. Indeed, ejection of the two mismatched bases positions the deoxyribose protons of the flanking C10 significantly closer to the chrysi ring than that of the mismatched C9. Accordingly, the present crystal structure, like the structure of - -[Rh[(R,R)-Me2trien]phi]3 (21), also indicates that intercalation via the major groove positions the chrysi ligand close to the H2 of the sugar ring (H2 Cchrysi27 2.9 Å). Consistent with other mechanistic studies (27), we propose that for major groove intercalators, the initial oxidative reaction involves abstraction of H2 , followed by hydrogen migration to form the C3 radical and subsequent degradation of the sugar ring. Notably, irradiation of crystals of the Rh-DNA complex but not in solution also results in strand cleavage, both at the matched and the mismatched positions with expected reaction products (Fig. 5). Analysis of the cleavage products, characteristic of each mechanism, thus may directly assess the binding mode of a metal complex with DNA.

two different binding modes for this metallointercalator: intercalation in matched DNA and insertion in the mismatched site. The comparison furthermore illustrates how the mismatched versus matched site may be distinguished. Intercalation of a complex occurs via the major groove and is typified by a doubling of the rise and no ejection of bases. On the contrary, insertion of a complex occurs via the minor groove and is characterized by ejection of the destabilized mismatch with no change in rise. The differing major and minor groove orientations for these binding modes also lead to distinct photochemical strand cleavage reactions. Furthermore, the large width of the major groove does not sterically hinder the ancillary bipyridine ligands of the complex and can accommodate both the and isomers, whereas the narrow width of the minor groove can only lodge the enantiomer within the right-handed B-DNA helix. These findings are in accordance with the low enantioselectivity observed for the major groove intercalator [Rh(phen)2phi]3 in contrast to the enantiospecificity observed for [Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 . Significantly, the bulky chrysi ligand intercalates shallowly in the more open major groove (Rh helical axis distance 5.8 Å) but deeply in the more sterically hindered minor groove (Rh helical axis distance 4.7 Å), indicating that steric hindrance is not a discriminating factor for minor groove insertion. The structure thus illustrates a clear strategy for mismatch

recognizes the mismatched site without consecutively interrogating every base extrahelically; rather, it is the local instability of the mismatch that enables -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 to eject the bases. Importantly, the metal complex does not eject the well paired bases but intercalates between them. These different binding modes for matched and mismatched DNA underscore a similar strategy by which repair proteins may examine DNA, where no extrahelical interrogation of each base pair is required. This 1.1-Å resolution crystal structure therefore reveals with atomic detail the structural basis for the recognition of thermodynamically destabilized mismatched sites in DNA and enables a direct comparison with intercalation at a matched site. As such, the structure illuminates a potential strategy for interrogation of DNA by repair proteins that does not involve sequential extrahelical interrogation of each base to detect lesions. Rather, it is the local instability of the mismatch that favors ejection only of mismatched bases. Materials and Methods

The product at 1,825 reflects cleavage only at the matched site yielding 5 -CGGAAA-phosphate. The colors in the duplex sequences above reflect the correspondence with the mass spectral fragments.

Photoactivated Cleavage Experiments. Photoactivated cleavage of the DNA by -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 in solution was analyzed under conditions similar to those used to grow the crystal. The oligonucleotide (200 M dsDNA) was annealed in 20 mM NaCacodylate (pH 7.0), 40 mM SrCl2, and 10 mM MgCl2. -[Rh(bpy)2chrysi]3 (680 M) was added, and the orange solution was irradiated for 1 h at 365 nm. Similarly, for photocleavage of the crystallized DNA, a crystal enclosed in a glass capillary was irradiated for 4 h at 365 nm at ambient temperature and redissolved in water before characterization. The reaction mixtures were desalted by using the ZipTip procedure. ZipTip C18 columns were equilibrated, and the oligonucleotides were bound, washed, and eluted in 10 l of acetonitrile/water as described in the procedure for oligonucleotides (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The oligonucleotides then were dried on a speedvac and redissolved in 1 l of water. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra were measured on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE Pro instrument.

solved by single anomalous dispersion using the anomalous scattering of rhodium (f 3.6 electrons for Rh at 1.54 Å) with the Shelxc/d/e suite of program (36, 37) on the data obtained with CuK radiation. We located 1.5 heavy atoms per asymmetric unit, with 1 atom on a special position. The structure then was refined by using the program ShelxH (38, 39) against 1.1-Å data to a final R1 15.2% and Rfree 20.4%. The rhodium complex located on the crystallographic twofold axis perpendicular to the helical axis of the DNA intercalates in two different orientations, resulting in four disordered residues of equivalent occupancies. In the later stage of refinement, indi1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. Iyer RR, Pluciennik A, Burdett V, Modrich PL (2006) Chem Rev 106:302­323.
