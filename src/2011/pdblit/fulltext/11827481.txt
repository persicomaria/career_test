Bacillus stearothermophilus phosphatase PhoE is a member of the cofactordependent phosphoglycerate mutase superfamily possessing broad specificity phosphatase activity. Its previous structural determination in complex with glycerol revealed probable bases for its efficient hydrolysis of both large, hydrophobic, and smaller, hydrophilic substrates. Here we report two further structures of PhoE complexes, to higher resolution of diffraction, which yield a better and thorough understanding of its catalytic mechanism. The environment of the phosphate ion in the catalytic site of the first complex strongly suggests an acid ­base catalytic function for Glu83. It also reveals how the C-terminal tail ordering is linked to enzyme activation on phosphate binding by a different mechanism to that seen in Escherichia coli phosphoglycerate mutase. The second complex structure with an unusual doubly covalently bound trivanadate shows how covalent modification of the phosphorylable His10 is accompanied by small structural changes, presumably to catalytic advantage. When compared with structures of related proteins in the cofactordependent phosphoglycerate mutase superfamily, an additional phosphate ligand, Gln22, is observed in PhoE. Functional constraints lead to the corresponding residue being conserved as Gly in fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases and Thr/Ser/Cys in phosphoglycerate mutases. A number of sequence annotation errors in databases are highlighted by this analysis. B. stearothermophilus PhoE is evolutionarily related to a group of enzymes primarily present in Gram-positive bacilli. Even within this group substrate specificity is clearly variable highlighting the difficulties of computational functional annotation in the cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase superfamily.

single protein fold. Its archetypal member, dPGM, has gradually yielded its secrets to decades of biochemical and structural analysis.2 ­ 5 As early as 1989, the enzyme catalyzing an apparently unrelated catalytic activity, fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F26BPase; EC 3.1.3.46), was predicted by sequence analysis to share a common fold and catalytic residues,6 a prediction subsequently verified by the determination of its structure.7 An increasing number of different specific phosphatase activities are now being associated with sequence relatives

412 of dPGM and F26BPase.8 ­ 10 Broad specificity phosphatase activity was identified in the superfamily in the form of Bacillus stearothermophilus PhoE11 (previously annotated as YhfR). The original functional annotation of PhoE as a dPGM highlights the difficulties in prediction of protein function from sequence alone,12 particularly in diverse superfamilies. As well as the evolutionary relationships apparent from sequence analysis, structural determinations have revealed the presence of dPGM-like folds in more distant relatives, both specific13 and non-specific14 phosphatases. The availability of various dPGM and F26BPase structures, supported by biochemical analysis, has enabled the identification of a common catalytic core and a good understanding of catalytic mechanism to be achieved.5,7,15,16 Key residues, using the PhoE numbering scheme, are His10 which is phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated in the course of the reaction, a group of residues, Arg9, Arg59, Asn16 and His151, which stabilize the phosphohistidine intermediate, and Glu83 which acts as proton donor during phosphorylation and proton acceptor during dephosphorylation. The phosphatase reaction proceeds through phosphorylation of His10 by the substrate, dissociation of the dephosphorylated product molecule, hydrolysis of phosphohistidine intermediate and release of product phosphate. dPGMs also catalyze in this manner, as a side reaction, the hydrolysis of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) to 2 or 3-phosphoglycerate (2 or 3-PGA) plus phosphate, but their principal reaction is the interconversion of 2 and 3-PGA. This requires an enzyme previously phosphorylated on His10 ("primed") by 2,3-BPG, a cofactor. This phospho group is transferred to incoming 2 or 3-PGA resulting in a 2,3-BPG intermediate molecule which largely remains bound to the enzyme, undergoing reorientation such that either phospho group of 2,3-BPG may be transferred back to His10 and the resulting 2 or 3-PGA product released. The key phosphohistidine intermediate, originally detected chemically,17 has now been observed in structures of both F26BPase and dPGM.5,7 Our previous structural determination of B. stearothermophilus PhoE18 confirmed the expected presence of a dPGM-like catalytic core characteristic of glycolytic enzymes. Briefly, the PhoE structure consists from a major domain, an a/b/a sandwich of central mixed b-sheet flanked on both sides by a-helices, and a smaller excursion composed of two a-helices and a b-sheet (Figure 1). The structure also revealed an open hydrophobic binding site for substrates, presumably responsible for its efficient dephosphorylation of large hydrophobic substrates such as a-naphthylphosphate.11 The structure suggested that small hydrophilic substrates, also efficiently hydrolyzed, could be accommodated within the positively charged, hydrophilic catalytic core.11 The occupation of the catalytic site by glycerol molecules in

that structure offered few clues as to the detailed catalytic mechanism of catalysis. Using new crystallization conditions we have now determined ° a much higher resolution (1.69 A) structure of PhoE containing a tetrahedral ligand, which evidence suggests to be a phosphate ion, at the catalytic site (Table 1). Comparison of the binding interactions of this ligand with dPGM and F26BPase complexes highlights a role for Gln22 and suggests that the presence of this residue defines phosphatase activity in the dPGM superfamily. The C-terminal tail, not previously defined by electron density, is partially ordered in the new structure and interacts, unexpectedly, with Arg9, a catalytic site residue. Through soaking of these crystals we also obtained a trivanadate complex, doubly covalently bonded to catalytic residues His10 and Glu83 (Table 1). The C-terminal tail In our earlier PhoE native structure,18 electron density was not apparent for the C-terminal five residues, Glu204­ Val208. In both the phosphate and vanadate complexes presented here sufficient density is present to enable an identical unambiguous tracing of the main-chain of this region. The main-chain position is clear despite these residues, in the phosphate complex for example, having higher than average B-factors (mean 88 compared to 35 for the rest of the protein) and poorer real space correlation coefficients (mean 0.73 compared to 0.95 for the remainder). As shown in Figure 1, these five residues adopt an extended conformation with the C-terminal carboxylate group interacting electrostatically with Arg9, a residue of the catalytic core (see below). Previously, due to a different position of Glu203, the C-terminal tail was presumed not to be capable of directly influencing the catalytic site.18 The C-terminal tail is one of the regions that most differ between members of the dPGM superfamily. Taking the end of the last strand of the core b-sheet as reference (residue 197 using PhoE numbering), PhoE has a tail ten residues long, compared with 19 and three residues for the dPGMs of Escherichia coli5 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe,19 respectively, and 34 residues for rat F26Bpase.15 Until recently, the role of the C-terminal tail in dPGMs was unclear, despite biochemical data suggesting its importance,20 largely because earlier dPGM crystals did not produce electron density for the region. Recently, it has been shown that ordering of the C-terminal tail in the E. coli dPGM accompanies adoption of an active phosphorylated state.5,16 A comparison of phosphorylated active5 and non-phosphorylated inactive16 E. coli dPGM structures has demonstrated a hydrogen bonding connection, via Asn16 (PhoE numbering), between enzyme phosphorylation and ordered C-terminal tail structure. Arg residues may provide a further link between substrate binding and tail ordering. A function

The B. stearothermophilus PhoE protein was produced and purified as described11 and stored at 2 80 8C with preservation of activity in 10.0 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.4), 1.0 mM DTT, 2.0 mM EDTA, 150.0 mM NaCl at a concentration of 25 mg/ml. Crystallization of the B. stearothermophilus PhoE­ phosphate complex was accomplished using the vapor diffusion, hanging drop method24 in 24 well VDX culture plates (Hampton Research Inc.). Equal volumes of the protein sample and reservoir solution (1 ml each), and 0.5 ml of AMP substrate11 (25 mM) were used and the mixture was equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution at 22 8C. A sparse matrix screen (Hampton Research Inc.) was used to obtain initial conditions. Diffraction quality irregularly shaped crystals were obtained after the refinement of initial conditions using 15.0% (v/v) ethylene glycol (EG), and 85.0 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 4.5), as the reservoir solution, in one to two weeks (0.5 mm £ 0.4 mm £ 0.3 mm). The PhoE­ vanadate complex was obtained by soaking the crystals described above in 50.0 mM of ammonium metavanadate (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), 30.0% EG, 20.0 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for three days in a depression dish. The PhoE ­phosphate complex crystals were soaked for 20 seconds in a cryoprotecting solution (30.0% EG, 25.0 mM AMP, and 55.0 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 4.5)) and flash frozen at 2170 8C in liquid nitrogen immediately before data collection. The PhoE ­ vanadate complex crystals were also flash frozen in liquid nitrogen directly from their soaking solution. Both sets of crystals were diffracted using a synchrotron X-ray radiation source, beamline 5.0.1 at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, with a ° 1.0 A wavelength. The oscillation diffraction images were recorded using an ADSC Quantum 4u CCD detector. The diffraction data were processed with the HKL2000 package.25 A Free R-factor,26 calculated from 5% of reflections set aside at the outset, was used to monitor the progress of refinement. The free R set from the earlier crystal17 was transferred to the new data for the phosphate complex and completed randomly in the higher resolution range. This free R assignment was then transferred to the trivanadate complex data. The new complex structures were solved using rigid body refinement with a maximum likelihood target using CNS27 and atoms of the refined model subjected to a random ° positional shift of up to 0.3 A in each of the x, y and z dimensions before further refinement in order to eliminate phase bias. All data were used throughout, without the application of sigma or amplitude-based cutoffs. Further rounds of positional and restrained individual B-refinement were carried out with a variety of stereochemical28 and other analyses29,30 periodically performed in order to locate possible model errors. Alternate conformations were introduced into the model when electron density clearly justified their inclusion. Ligands were modeled and refined with the aid of the HIC-UP database.31 The phosphate complex contains a phosphate ion and an ethylene glycol molecule in the catalytic site, and a second ethylene glycol molecule at the protein surface. The trivanadate complex contains trivanadate in the catalytic site and a partially occupied phosphate group at the protein surface. Water molecules were added into 3s peaks of the s-A weighted l2Fo 2 Fcl map within hydrogen bonding distance of suitable model atoms. Programs of the CCP4 package32 were used for manipulations and O29 for visualization and manual rebuilding. Structural superpositions were made with LSQMAN.33 The structures and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB PDB with codes 1h2e and 1h2esf (phosphate complex) and 1h2f and 1h2fsf (trivanadate complex).

for the C-terminal tail in E. coli dPGM of indirect phosphohistidine intermediate stabilization was thereby proposed.5 The conformation of the PhoE C-terminal tail most resembles that of F26BPase, despite the disparity in overall length (Figure 1). In both cases the tail turns through around 908 relative to the last b-strand of the core b-sheet in order lie over

the catalytic site. Despite this overall similarity, the side-chains of the two tails do not make equivalent contacts, with the exception of PhoE Val208 which occupies approximately the same position as Val441 in rat F26BPase, albeit adopting a different side-chain conformation.

seems to be related to this latter residue's different conformation in the present structures, as compared with the earlier one. In the conformation observed in the earlier structure, Arg9 is not suitably positioned to interact with the phosphate group, nor with the Val208 carboxylate. Instead it accepts hydrogen bonds from the Tyr175 OH and the main-chain nitrogen of Met176. When phosphate binds the x1 angle of the Arg9 side-chain changes from 658 to 2 1768, with the rest of the side-chain remaining extended. This change simultaneously enables the interaction of Arg9 with phosphate and with Val208 carboxylate. The connection between the C-terminal tail and catalytic site provided by Arg9 is reminiscent of that observed for Asn16 in the E. coli dPGM structures. It can therefore be proposed, in an analogous way, that ordering of the C-terminal tail upon phosphate binding offers additional stabilization of the active conformation of the catalytic core. PhoE also contains a corresponding Asn16, but it

is positioned identically in the three PhoE structures. Comparison of the present PhoE structures with the earlier one is consistent with the idea that occupation of the phosphate binding site near to the phosphorylable histidine is sufficient for C-terminal tail ordering, the covalent modification of that residue by phosphorylation5 or vanadylation (the PhoE ­ vanadate complex) not necessarily being required. This conclusion may be drawn only for PhoE, with its unique availability of apoenzyme,18 product bound, and phosphorylated intermediate mimicking structures, but seems likely to apply for other dPGM superfamily members. Active, non-phosphorylated dPGM and inactive F26BPase structures would be particularly interesting targets for structural determination, not least as a means to test the generality of this observation. The occurrence of only minimal structural changes on the transition from structures with an occupied phosphate pocket to phosphorylated structures

makes excellent functional sense, as discussed below. The catalytic site The clearly tetrahedral density at the catalytic site (Figure 2(a)) along with the presence of cacodylate buffer under the new crystallization conditions initially led us to assign the density to cacodylate. However, this assignment on refinement led to unrealistically close contacts (as little ° as 2.6 A) between cacodylate methyl groups and polar protein atoms neighboring the density. Additionally, the arsenic atom in the refined cacodylate received a B-factor of 49, significantly higher than the remaining cacodylate atoms (around 32). Reassigning this tetrahedral density as phosphate removed the unfavorable contacts, generating an

extensive network of hydrogen bonds, and yielded a phosphorus B-factor of 35, close to those assigned to the oxygen atoms (around 31). Sulphate would be another possible identity of the molecule responsible for the tetrahedral density but there were no sulphate ions used neither in the purification or crystallization of PhoE. The phosphate group likely originates in hydrolysis of the substrate molecules, AMP in the cases of the crystals analyzed here, that were found essential for the crystallization process (J.E.L. & M.J.J., unpublished results). No inorganic phosphate compounds were used during the purification or crystallization procedures. The assigned phosphate group, after refinement, lies at the center of an extensive network of hydrogen bonds (Figure 2(a)). Four of these phosphate hydrogen bonding partners are positively charged (His10, His 151, Arg9 and Arg59 side-chains) and three neutral (Asn16 and Gln22 side-chains along with the Gly152 backbone nitrogen). The final bonding partner Glu83, making the closest

° phosphate contact (2.6 A between Glu OE2 atom and O4 of phosphate) is presumably also neutral, probably due to the proximity of the negatively charged phosphate, whose binding is forced, notwithstanding the proximity of Glu83, because of its other highly favorable interactions with PhoE. This positioning of Glu83 shows that it donates a proton directly to the substrate during the phosphorylation of His10, without the intermediacy of a water molecule.18 Superimposition of complexes of F26BPase reveals that their bound phosphate groups virtually superimpose on the phosphate observed in the PhoE complex, although some minor differences in side-chain conformations of binding residues are visible. Some of these F26BPase complexes were crystallized at alkaline pH21 suggesting that protonation of Glu83 in the PhoE ­ phosphate complex, is not related to the relatively low pH at which this latter was crystallized. The main PhoE conformational difference induced by phosphate binding is in the Arg9 sidechain (see above). A smaller conformational change in Arg59 is also apparent involving x3 and x4 changes, which suitably positions both the N1 and Nh1 atoms for interaction with phosphate. In the earlier structure, only Nh1 would be able to interact with phosphate. Vanadate is commonly used to study the binding and catalytic mechanism of enzymes whose substrates contain phospho or sulpho groups. Covalent and non-covalent binding to protein and/or ligands has been observed, typically involving single vanadate units, but also the linear and cyclic vanadate polymers that form in solution. Encouraged by the vanadate binding observed in E. coli dPGM15 and to the distant dPGM relative, prostatic acid phosphatase,22 the crystals of the PhoE ­ phosphate complex were soaked in vanadate. In contrast to the non-covalent binding of tetravanadate to E. coli, and to the transition state mimicking seen for rat prostatic acid phosphatase, difference maps clearly showed the presence of trivanadate, surprisingly covalently bound both to His10 and to Glu83 (Figure 2(b)). In this case, the modification of His10 can be confidently assumed to mimic the phosphohistidine intermediate. The displacement of phosphate by vanadate and this latter's twin covalent modification of the protein lead to few structural changes (Figure 2). The

overall main-chain hardly alters (r.m.s. displace° ment for 621 atoms of 0.16 A). At the catalytic site ° together with a x1 rotation a backbone shift of 0.4 A of 108 are observed as His10 accompanies the change in N12 to tetrahedral center atom distance ° ° from 3.12 A (non-bonded N12-P) to 1.77 A (cova12 lently bonded N -V). Strikingly, with the exceptions of the Gln22 and Glu83 hydrogen bonds, all the interactions made by the three phosphate oxygen atoms are conserved in the corresponding vanadate atoms of the vanadate unit covalently bonded to His10 (Figure 2). The distance between phosphate P and the first vanadate V in super° imposed structures is just 0.65 A, less that the 12 displacement of His N between the two struc° tures (0.9 A). Catalytically, to minimize the structural changes accompanying the transitions from substrate complex to intermediate is advantageous, since the activation energy of the reaction will thereby be reduced. Comparison of phosphate complexes and the phosphohistidine form of F26BPase leads to the same conclusion. Conceivably the success of this family in optimizing catalytic efficiency in this way is related to the widespread adoption of the fold for the catalysis of diverse reactions. The PhoE ­trivanadate complex apparently represents the first structure of a protein covalently modified with trivanadate, as well as the first covalent modification of more than one residue with vanadate. Just as the proximity of Glu83 to the phosphate group in the phosphate complex provides indirect evidence for its being protonated, the nucleophilic attack on the vanadate by which it was covalently modified in the metavanadate complex demonstrates its ionized state. The facility with which Glu83, involved in acid­ base catalysis, changes ionization state is thus illustrated. A glutamine residue at position 22 is an indicator of phosphatase activity Although many features of the current structures are in line with observations previously made for dPGMs and F26BPases, serving therefore to locate common structural and catalytic features of the superfamily, one difference draws particular attention. Among the ligands of phosphate in PhoE ­ phosphate is Gln22, a residue present in neither dPGMs or F26BPases. In fact, this position

is occupied by a conserved glycine residue (located in an area of the Ramachandran plot disallowed for non-glycine residues) in F26BPases and by Ser, Thr or Cys in dPGMs. The extra stabilization of the phosphate offered by its additional interaction with Gln22 raises the question as to why neither dPGMs or F26BPases allow its presence. In the case of F26BPases, the backbone nitrogen atom forms a hydrogen bond with O3 of the fructose ring.15 The positioning of this glycine residue (and the following glycine, also conserved) in unusual areas of the Ramachandran plot suggests that the local backbone conformation necessary to make the interaction with O3 of the fructose, and thereby help define substrate specificity, is only accessible to a diglycine pair. In the case of dPGMs, the backbone nitrogen atom of the corresponding Thr/Ser/ Cys, along with the backbone nitrogen atom of the following Gly, have been proposed to bind the carboxylate group of 2,3-BPG. Thus, it appears that a small residue may be required at the position corresponding to PhoE Gln22 for unimpeded ligand binding. These considerations suggest that the simple presence of a Gln residue corresponding to PhoE Gln22 in a given dPGM superfamily member should be enough to cast doubt on its functional assignment as either dPGM of F26BPase. In order to test this hypothesis, annotations were examined for the 77 members with a Gln at position 22 in a list of 437 dPGM superfamily members. Mainly these annotations are of equivocal kind, dPGMlike, member of dPGM family, similar to dPGM etc., although 16 are annotated simply as dPGMs, two as dPGM/F26BPase and one as F26BPase. Alignment of these reveals that not a single one possesses a full set of either F26BP binding residues15 or 2,3-BPG binding residues,16 strongly reinforcing our doubts regarding their current functional annotation. A single sequence is experimentally annotated, the mannitol-1-phosphatase from Eimeria tenella.9 When PhoE was first subjected to detailed analysis,11 relatively few close homologues were found and the conclusion reached was that PhoE was not the founder member of a clear family, such as the dPGMs or F26BPases. Since then many bacterial genomes have been fully sequenced prompting a re-examination of the question. In BLAST output, 29 homologues, each containing a Gln at position 22, precede the first clear hit to a reliably annotated protein, a potato F26BPase. Phylogenetic analysis (not shown) of these sequences, plus several others slightly worse placed in the output, along with dPGMs, F26BPases, a-ribazole-50 -phosphate phosphatases8 and mannitol-1-phsopahatases9 revealed their clear evolutionary separation from these wellcharacterized proteins. Distance and parsimonybased methods produced identical branching orders revealing the presence of three sub-groups in the close Gln22-containing homologues. Group 1 contains B. stearothermophilus PhoE along with

three other sequences sharing 32 ­ 42% sequence identity. Group 2 contains 22 proteins, sharing 21 ­31% sequence identity with group 1 while group 3, still further separated evolutionarily, with six members, shares 25 ­ 33% sequence identity with group 1. In total, 14 species, all bacterial, are represented in these groups, all but two are Gram-positive bacilli. Alignment of these sequences (Figure 3) reveals reasonable conservation of the conspicuous hydrophobic PhoE substrate binding residues18 in group 1, but little conservation elsewhere. The main region of sequence divergence within and between the three groups is for the region 95 ­120 (PhoE numbering scheme) corresponding structurally to the excursion from the main a/b/adomain. As well as low sequence conservation, the length of this segment varies dramatically in these proteins, from 17 ­48 residues, compared with the 26 residues seen in PhoE (Figure 3). In all members of the dPGM superfamily, residues from this portion contribute significantly to the substrate binding site. The striking diversity of this segment in the family shown in Figure 3 therefore strongly implies the presence of diverse substrate specificities among their members. Interestingly, a variety of pathogenic organisms: Streptococci, Listeria, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis, are represented in this family, making it a particularly interesting subject for further research.
