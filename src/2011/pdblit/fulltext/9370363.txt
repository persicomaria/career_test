Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease hydrolysis of the Gag CA-p2 cleavage site is crucial for virion maturation and is optimal at acidic pH. To understand the processing of the CA-p2 site, we have determined the structure of HlV-1 protease complexed with an analog of the CA-p2 site, [r denotes the reduced peptide bond the reduced peptide inhibitor Arg-Val-Leu-r-Phe-Glu-Ala-Ahx-NH, and Ahx 2-aminohexanoic acid (norleucine), respectively]. The crystal structure was refined to an Rfactor of 0.17 at 0.21-nm resolution. The crystals have nearly the same lattice as related complexes in P2,2,2, which have twofold disordered inhibitor, but are in space group P2,, and the asymmetric unit contains two dimers of HIV-1 protease related by 180" rotation. An approximate non-crystallographic symmetry has replaced the exact crystal symmetry resulting in well-ordered inhibitor structure. Each protease dimer binds one ordered inhibitor molecule, but in opposite orientations. The interactions of the inhibitor with the two dimers are very similar for the central P2 Val to P2' Glu residues, but show more variation for the distal P3 Arg and P4' Ahx residues. Importantly, the carboxylate oxygens of Glu at P2' in the inhibitor are within hydrogen-bonding distance of a carboxylate oxygen of Asp30 of the protease suggesting that the two side chains share a proton. This interaction suggests that the enzyme-substrate complex is additionally stabilized at lower pH. The importance of this interaction is emphasized by the absence of polymorphisms of Asp30 in the protease and variants of P2` Glu in the critical CA-p2 cleavage site.

Maturation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins by the viral protease is crucial for the production of infectious virus particles (for review see Oroszlan and Luftig, 1990; Swanstrom et al., 1990). The protease catalyzes the hydrolysis of specific sequences in the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins to release itself and the other mature structural and functional viral proteins (Darke et al., 1988; Kohl et al., 1988). The viral protease has proven to be a good target for anti-HIV agents and several inhibitors of HIV-1 protease are currently available for treatment of AIDS infection. However, the therapeutic efficacy of protease inhibitors is limited due to the rapid selection of inhibitor resistant variants of the protease (Schinazi et al., 1996). Therefore, further studies of the molecular basis for the specificity of the protease for its substrates and inhibitors will be valuable for overcoming drug resistance.

The 99-residue HlV-1 protease is a member of the aspartic proteinase family and is enzymatically active as a homodimer. Crystal structures of the uninhibited HIV-1 protease and of the protease in complex with different inhibitors have been determined (for review, see Wlodawer and Erickson, 1993). The HIV-1 protease is highly specific for native precursor polyproteins or peptide substrates that correspond to the natural cleavage sites (Darke et al., 1988; Tozser et al., 1991). Catalysis is most efficient for peptides of seven residues extending from P4 to P3`, where the scissile bond is between P1 and Pl', but the selectivity for cleavage is not obvious due to the absence of a well-defined consensus sequence. However, kinetic measurements for hydrolysis of peptides with single amino acid substitutions at each position have defined the residues that form the best substrates for a particular peptide sequence (Tozser et al., 1992; Griffith et al., 1992; Cameron et al., 1993). Furthermore, comparison of the amino acid sequences of HlV-1 cleavage sites and non-viral substrates of the HIV-1 protease suggests a stringency for residues at positions P2, P1, and P2' (Poorman et al., 1991). Although a majority (>60%) of the non-viral substrates have Glu at the P2` position, only one, the capsid-p2 (CA-p2) junction, of the nine HIV-1 cleavage sites in the Gag and GagPol polyproteins, has P2' Glu. The cleavage of the CA-p2 site is an important regulatory step for the sequential processing of the Gag precursor (Pettit et al., 1994). Cleavage of the CA-p2

site is influenced by the p2 domain and is accelerated at lower pH, perhaps due to protonation of the P2' Glu. Thus, to understand the molecular basis of this critical processing event in Gag maturation, we have analyzed the protease in complex with an analog of the CA-p2 site. The HIV-1 protease variant that is resistant to self-proteolysis (Mildner et al., 1994) was crystallized in complex with the reduced peptide inhibitor Arg-Val-Leu-r-Phe-Glu-Ala-Ahx-NH,, where r denotes the reduced peptide bond and Ahx is 2-aminohexanoic acid (norleucine), an analog of the CA-p2 cleavage site. Initial analysis suggested the space group P2,2,2, containing one protease dimer and two disordered, half occupancy inhibitors. However, the crystal structure actually is in space group P2, and contains two dimers of HIV-1 protease, each with one ordered inhibitor. The dimers are related by an approximate twofold axis, but the inhibitor binds in opposite orientations in the two dimers. In one protease dimer, the carboxylate oxygens of Glu at P2' in the inhibitor are within hydrogen-bonding distance of the carboxylate oxygen of Asp30 of the protease suggesting that the two side chains share a proton. This interaction could explain the observation that >60 % of non-viral sequences that are hydrolyzed by HIV protease have Glu at P2'. The absence of polymorphisms of Asp30 in the protease (Kozal et al., 1996; Los Alamos database) and conservation of P2' Glu in CA-p2 (Barrie et al., 1996) further emphasize a critical mechanism in the maturation events of the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins.

acetate, pH 4.7, and 5 mM dithiothreitol with fivefold molar excess of inhibitor by varying the conditions described previously (Bhat et al., 1994). Small crystals were grown by vapor diffusion against a reservoir solution of 66 mM sodium citrate, 132 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10% dimethylsulfoxide, and 44-45 % saturated ammonium sulfate. Crystals of about 0.4X0.05X0.05 mm' were used for macroseeding under similar conditions with 41 -42 % saturated ammonium sulfate. A second macroseeding with 40-41 % saturated ammonium sulfate resulted in a crystal of 0.4X0.08X0.08 mm' that was used for measurement of diffraction data. X-ray diffraction data were collected on an R-AXIS imaging plate detector mounted on an RU200 Rigaku rotating anode X-ray generator that was operated at 50 kV and 100 mA with a 0.5-mm collimator. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature with 3.0" oscillations. Each oscillation frame was exposed for 45 min. The distance to the detector plate was set at 100 mm. The diffraction data extended to 0.21-nm resolution. The space group was determined by the symmetry and systematic absences. A small number of weak intensities were observed at systematic absences along the OkO axis. Initially, the diffraction data were reduced in space group P2,2,2, and later reduced in space group P2, order to model the disorder in the inhibitor. The unit cell dimensions were a = 5.96 nm, b = 5.22 nm, and c = 6.17 nm. The crystal structure was solved in space group P2,2,2, by molecular replacement using the HIV protease-inhibitor crystal structure 7HVP (Swain et al., 1990) as the starting model. The structure was refined using XPLOR (Brunger, 1992) and refitted to 2F,-Fc and F,-F, electron density maps using the program EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES FRODO (Jones, 1985). First, the structure was refined as one Cells bearing the construct for the expression of the triply protease dimer with two partial occupancy inhibitor molecules mutated HIV-1 protease (Gln7+Lys, Leu33+Ile, and in space group P2,2,2,.

with 0.45 occupancy each for a total occupancy of less than the expected value of 1.0. The electron density map for the inhibitors is shown in Fig. IA, and the disorder is clearly visible for the PI and P1' positions, where the density resembles phenylalanine with added small projections for the superimposed leucine side chain. However, it was difficult to fit the atoms to the density that represented a superposition of two inhibitors, and the protease residues near the inhibitor were also disordered. This disorder would necessitate modelling multiple conformations for the inhibitor and for the protease residues forming the inhibitorbinding site. Therefore, the simpler approach of introducing two dimers into the asymmetric unit wag tested. First, two independent copies of the protease dimer with inhibitor were introduced at half occupancy in the P2,2,2, space group. However, this approach to modelling the disorder was numerically unstable and the refinement behaved poorly. Therefore, the diffraction data were reduced in space group P2, to test if the disorder of the inhibitor could be modeled more correctly as one single occupancy inhibitor in each of two protease dimers. The presence of very weak intensities Cf,,Jsigma of 2.3-3.0) at several odd indices along the axes, with the exception of 010, was consistent with the lower symmetry P2, space group in the c-unique setting, The diffraction data were reduced to a lower R merge in P2, and the structure was refined to the lower R factor of 0.17 compared to 0.19 after refinement in space group P2,2,2, (Table 1). Refinement in P2, was tested with an asymmetric unit

consisting of two copies of the P2,2,2, dimer related by a rotation of 180" and no inhibitor. The initial 2F,,-Fc map clearly showed density for one ordered inhibitor in each protease dimer. The two inhibitors were related by about 0" rotation and bound in different orientations in the two protease dimers. Therefore, the orientation of the inhibitor is correlated with the lattice, and the apparent disorder in the higher space group was an artifact of the use of the incorrect space group. The refinement was continued after adding the two inhibitor molecules. The conformation of the inhibitor and its interactions with the protein were refined more accurately in the P2, model. The final structure and electron density for the inhibitor molecules in the two dimers refined in the space group P2, is shown in Fig. 1B and C, and demonstrates that the two HIV protease dimers bind the inhibitor in opposite orientations. Several crystal structures of HIV protease have been refined with inhibitors that exhibited twofold disorder similar to that shown in Fig. 1A for the structure refined in the higher symmetry space group. Conformational or orientational disorder is observed when the binding of the ligand is not correlated with either the crystal lattice or the symmetry operators. Reduction to a lower space group will resolve the disorder only if the conformations or orientations are correlated with the lattice, but not with the higher symmetry. Because the disorder involves changes in a small fraction of the atoms, estimated to correspond to about 1% of the scattering amplitude in this case, then the expected maximum change in the scattering intensities may be small with respect to the error in the data. The 1% change in scattering amplitudes would result in a maximum difference of 2% in the intensities. Typical symmetry R factors on intensities are in the range 5-lo%, and a difference of 2% may therefore not be apparent in the data reduction statistics. It is always legitimate to reduce the symmetry to a sub-group, so it is crystallographically valid to lower the symmetry when there is suspicious disorder in the structure. The choice of the lower symmetry space group will be verified if the disorder is resolved into ordered density. Most crystal structures of HIV-1 protease contain either one protease dimer or one subunit in the asymmetric unit (Wlodawer and Erickson, 1993). In some crystal structures, one unique inhibitor molecule is observed bound to the protease dimer, while in other structures the inhibitor shows twofold disorder. However, it is not obvious whether refinement of these structures in a lower symmetry space group was tested for all cases, There is also a crystal structure of HIV-2 protease with a peptidic inhibitor that has two protease dimers, each with two disordered inhibitors, in the asymmetric unit (Tong et al., 1993). Thus, HIV-1 protease is variable in the types of crystal packing interactions it can assume.

Comparison of two HIV-1 protease dimers. The structures of the two protease dimers are very similar with root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.034 nm for main chain atoms and 0,097 nm for side chain atoms. The two dimers are also similar to the crystal structure of HIV-1 protease with the MVTlOl reduced peptide inhibitor (Miller et al., 1989), with rms deviations for dimers 1 and 2 of 0.049 nm and 0,050 nm on main chain atoms and 0.129 nm and 0.136 nm on side chain atoms, respectively. These differences are within the experimental errors observed for different crystal structures of identical proteins, where recent comparisons have found a range 0.016-0.079 nm for main chain atoms (Zegers et al., 1994). The side chain atoms of these protease dimers have lower rms deviations than the range of 0.132-0.168 nm reported for different crystal forms of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Wlodawer et al., 1987). The two dimers had larger differences in one region of each subunit, the residues 41-45 of subunit 1 and 41'-43' of subunit 2

Comparison of the inhibitors in protease dimers 1 and 2. The protease dimers in the P2, crystal structure each bind one inhibitor in opposite orientations. The CA-p2 analog inhibitor ArgVal-Leu-r-Phe-Glu-Ala-Ahx-NH,, from P3 to P4'. The extends two orientations can be distinguished because the two subunits of HIV-1 protease are asymmetric, and the interflap hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Ile50' and the amide of Gly51 has been used to define the first and second subunits in each dimer (Table 3). In dimer 1, residues P3 Arg to PI Leu of the inhibitor are bound in the first subunit, and residues PI` Phe to P4' Ahx are in the second subunit. The opposite is observed in the second dimer in the asymmetric unit. The inhibitor showed clear electron density from P2 Val to P3' Ala in both dimers, but the density becomes weaker at the termini. In dimer 1, there is discontinuous density for the side chain of P3 Arg, although P3` Ala and P4` Nle are in continuous density (Fig. 1B). In dimer 2, there is clear density for the side chain of P3 Arg, but weaker, discontinuous density for the side chain of P4' Ahx (Fig. IC). The conformation of the two inhibitors is compared in Fig. 3. The rms deviation is 0.109 nm on main chain atoms. P3 Arg, P3' Ala, and P4' Nle show more variation in position than do the central P2-P2' residues. This result is consistent with structures of other inhibitors which also show more variation in the conformation of the distal residues than for residues P2 to P2' near the non-hydrolyzable bond (Wlodawer and Erickson, 1993).

HIV-1 protease-inhibitor interactions and comparison to other inhibitors. The inhibitor forms hydrogen bond interactions with the protease dimers that are similar to those observed in other HIV-1 protease-inhibitor structures (Gustchina et al., 1994 ; Wlodawer and Erickson, 1993). The conserved hydrogen bond interactions between the peptide amide and carbonyl oxygen atoms and protease atoms extend from the carbonyl oxygen of P3 Arg to the amide of P3' Ala (Table 3). The unique water molecule that is observed between the flaps and the inhibitor in crystal structures of HIV protease is present in both protease dimers. The hydrogen bond distances between the carbonyl oxygens of P2 and PI' and the water molecule tend to be shorter than the other protease-inhibitor hydrogen bond lengths, as noted previously (Gustchina et al., 1994). The termini of the inhibitor showed different interactions in the two dimers. The inhibitor in dimer 1 showed a hydrogen bond interaction between the amide of P3 Arg and the side chain of Asp30', while the amide of P4` Ahx formed two interactions with the side chain oxygens of Asp29 and Asp30. These interactions were not observed in dimer 2. Instead, the side chain of P3 Arg formed an ionic interaction with the side chain of Asp30, and the carbonyl oxygen of P4' Ahx formed a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Lys45'. Interestingly, Lys45 is the site of a drugresistant variant of HIV-1 protease, Lys45-Ile (Schinazi et al., 1996). Variant Ile45 cannot form the hydrogen bond with the P4' carbonyl oxygen that is observed for Lys45 (Table 3), suggesting that this change will reduce the affinity for substrates.

(Fig. 2). These residues form a surface loop leading to the flap. The plot of average B factor per residue is very similar for both dimers (Fig. 2). There is some correlation between residues with high rms deviations and high B factors. Overall, the two protease dimers are essentially identical in conformation and show a similar distribution of B factors.

Sites of mutations and the interactions of protease dimers. Leu33+Ile and Leu63-Ile are conservative substitutions of partly buried hydrophobic residues with little effect on the protease structure. The Gln7-+Lys mutation alters a surface residue. The side chain of Lys7 from the first subunit of both dimers has no interactions with other protease residues. However, the side chain of Lys7` from the other subunit is involved in crystal packing interactions that connect the two dimers. Lys7' of dimer 1 has a hydrogen bond interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of residue 10' from a symmetry related dimer 2, while Lys7` of dimer 2 forms an ion pair with Glu21' from a symmetry related dimer 1. The interactions of Lys7' stabilize the two dimers in the crystal lattice without altering the dimer conformation. Therefore, the Gln7-Lys mutation may promote the arrangement of dimers observed in the P2, lattice. The two dimers within the asymmetric unit interact by van der Waals' interactions between the hydrophobic side chains of residues Pro9, Pro81, Pro44`, Met46', and Phe53' from one dimer and residues Ile63, Ile72, Thr4', and Trp6' from the other dimer. The Trp6' side chain packs between the side chains of Phe53` and Pro81, which also form part of the inhibitor binding site.

Interactions between P2' Glu of inhibitor and Asp30 of protease. The inhibitor used in this study is an analog of the CA-p2 cleavage site, which is unique among HIV-1 protease viral cleavage sites in having Glu at P2'. Interactions of the P2' Glu with the protease are shown in Tables 3 and 4. The side chain oxygen of P2' Glu formed two weak hydrogen bond interactions with the amides of Asp29 and Asp30 of HIV protease in dimer 1. These interactions were not present in dimer 2, although the P2' Glu side chain has a similar orientation to that in dimer 1. Glu at P2' in another reduced peptide inhibitor has

similar interactions with HIV-2 protease (Tong et al., 1993), as does P2` Glu in the product complex with simian immunodeficiency virus protease (Rose et al., 1996). The absolute conservation of the P2` Glu in the CA-p2 junction (Barrie et al., 1996) and its high frequency of occurrence in non-viral substrates (Poorman et al., 1991) suggested a more specific interaction between P2' Glu and the protease. We now show that both side chain oxygens of P2' Glu are 0.28 nm from the carboxylate oxygen 062 of Asp30 in dimer 1, while in dimer 2 one side chain oxygen of P2' Glu is 0.35 nm from 062 of Asp30` (Table 4). The proximity of the acidic side chains of P2' Glu and Asp30 in dimer 1 suggests that these side chains share a proton. The pKa of Asp30 of protease was determined to be 4.0 by titrating pH-dependent chemical shifts in a enzyme-inhibitor complex (Yamazaki et al., 1994). Therefore, either the Asp30 or the P2` Glu side chain is protonated near pH 4.0. Further support of this interpretation comes from our analysis of the crystal structures of the HIV-2 protease-inhibitor complex of Tong et al. (1993) and the complex of simian immunodeficiency virus protease with product peptide (Rose et al., 1996). We found that the P2' Glu side chain oxygen of the inhibitor is within 0.26 nm of the Asp30 carboxylate oxygen of HIV-2 protease in 3 out of 4 subunits, and both side chain oxygens of P2' Glu in the product peptide are within 0.29 nm of the Asp30 carboxylate oxygen of the simian protease (Table 4). Thus crystal structures of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus proteases with inhibitors or a product peptide containing Glu at P2` are consistent with a proton-mediated interaction with Asp30. The implication is that protease binding and hydrolysis of the CA-p2 cleavage site in the polyprotein will depend on the pH inside the virion. The p2 domain is suggested to regulate the cleavage of the natural CA-p2 site in Gag and this cleavage is accelerated at lower pH (Pettit et al., 1994). The protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of the related chromogenic substrate Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-LeuPhe(N0,)-Glu-Ala-Ahx, is optimal at pH 4.0 (Polgar et al., 1994). The protease complex with the CA-p2 peptide was modeled in the presence and absence of a proton between Asp30 and

P2' Glu, as described in Weber and Harrison (1996). The models confirmed that the proton is required to stabilize the conformation of the residues that is observed in the crystal structure. However, since the pH within the immature virion is not known, it is not possible to confirm that processing of the CA-p2 site in vivo is dependent on the protonation of Asp30 of protease or P2' Glu of the substrate. However, the absence of polymorphisms of Asp30 of the protease (Kozal et al., 1996; Los Alamos database) and conservation of P2' Glu in the CA-p2 cleavage site sequence (Barrie et al., 1996) suggests that pH-dependent processing through protonation of either the Asp30 of the enzyme or P2` Glu of the C A p 2 cleavage site sequence may be a critical regu-

latory mechanism for proper assembly and maturation of the virion. Consistent with a key regulatory mechanism, a chimera of the CA-p2 cleavage site sequence tethered to the C-terminus of HIV-1 Vpr was shown to inhibit viral replication by loo%, unlike the chimera with other cleavage site sequences (Serio et al., 1997). In light of these observations, it is significant that a majority of the non-viral sequences that are substrates of the HIV-1 protease (Poorman et al., 1991) and two of the major sites of autoproteolysis of HIV-1 protease (Mildner et al., 1994) have Glu at P2`. Recently, the mutation A s p 3 b A s n in HIV-1 protease was observed on exposure to the inhibitor nelfinavir (Schinazi et al., 1996). However, the effect of this mutation on viral replication has not been described. It will be important to consider the conserved interaction of Asp30 of protease with P2' Glu of the substrate in the structure-based design of novel drugs to target the virus and overcome drug resistance.
