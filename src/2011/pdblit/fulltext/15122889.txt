ABSTRACT: The Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains a heme oxygenase (pa-HO) that primarily oxygenates the -meso heme carbon [Caignan, G. A., Deshmukh, R., Wilks, A., Zeng, Y., Huang, H. W., Moenne-Loccoz, P., Bunce, R. A., Eastman, M. A., and Rivera, M. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 14879-14892]. This differs from other previously characterized heme oxygenases, which display regioselectivity for the R-meso heme carbon. Here we report the crystal structure of pa-HO at 1.60 Å resolution and compare it to the 1.50 Å structure of nm-HO from Neisseria meningitidis [Schuller, D. J., Zhu, W., Stojiljkovic, I., Wilks, A., and Poulos, T. L. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 11552-11558]. The crystal structure of pa-HO maintains the same overall fold as other bacterial and mammalian heme oxygenases, including a conserved network of hydrogen-bonded solvent molecules important for dioxygen activation. The novel -regioselectivity of heme oxygenation observed by pa-HO is due to the heme being rotated by 100°, which places the -meso heme carbon in the same position as the R-meso heme carbon in other heme oxygenases. The main interaction in pa-HO that stabilizes the unique heme orientation is a salt bridge between Lys132 and the heme 7-propionate, as well as hydrophobic contacts involving Leu29, Val33, and Phe189 with the heme methyl and vinyl groups.

Heme oxygenase (HO)1 catalyzes the initial steps in heme degradation. The overall heme oxygenase reaction involves a sequence of transformations that consumes three molecules of O2 and seven electrons (Figure 1). The first electron reduces the ferric heme iron to the ferrous state, followed by O2 binding to form a dioxygen complex. Addition of a second electron and one proton to the oxy complex generates a reactive hydroperoxy intermediate, Fe(III)-OOH (1). In most heme oxygenases the Fe(III)-OOH hydroxylates the R-meso heme position to give ferric R-meso-hydroxyheme (1, 2). This differs from cytochromes P450 and peroxidase enzymes, which heterolytically cleave the O-O bond to generate a ferryl Fe(IV)-O species (3). The crystal structures of human and rat HO-1 (4, 5), and bacterial nm-HO and cdHO (6, 7) suggest that the R-regioselectivity of the reaction is likely to be controlled by steric interactions between the distal helix and the heme. Furthermore, hydrogen-bonding interactions within the active site may help to orient molecular oxygen toward the R-meso carbon. Upon reaction with one molecule of O2 and one electron, R-meso-hydroxy This work was supported by NIH Grants GM33688 (to T.L.P.) and AI55912 (to A.W.).

heme is converted to verdoheme, with release of the R-meso carbon as CO (8-10). The conversion of verdoheme to the biliverdin product is not well understood but does require both molecular oxygen and reducing equivalents (11, 12). HO has been identified in a large number of organisms, including higher green plants, red algae, and cyanobacteria, where the HO reaction is required for the formation of openchain tetrapyrrole pigments, phytobilins (13). In mammals the product CO has been implicated as a neuronal secondmessenger molecule in various physiological pathways (1418), while biliverdin and its reduced form, bilirubin, may work as physiological antioxidants (19-21). Of particular interest, HO is present in some pathogenic bacteria including Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrheae. In the Gram-negative pathogens N. meningitidis and N. gonorrheae, HO was shown to be necessary for bacterial utilization of iron from imported heme (22). Recently, a heme oxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa-HO) was identified by its high amino acid sequence identity (37%) with a heme oxygenase from N. meningitidis (nm-HO) (23). P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of systemic infections, particularly in those afflicted with cystic fibrosis, as well as cancer and AIDS patients who are immunosuppressed (24, 25). P. aeruginosa prefers anaerobic metabolism, which requires micromolar quantities of host iron for optimal growth (26). Because there is essentially no free iron in mammals (27), pa-HO is critical for the acquisition of host iron. pa-HO is unusual since it hydroxylates heme predominantly at the

Substituents are numbered 1-8, and abbreviations are given by Me (methyl group), V (vinyl group), and P (propionic acid group).

-meso carbon (28), while all other well-studied HOs hydroxylate the R-meso carbon (29-31). However, mutants of HO-1 have been shown to exhibit altered regioselectivity. For example, mutating Arg183 in rat HO-1 leads to the formation of -biliverdin, suggesting that heme propionateprotein interactions are important in controlling regioselectivity (32). Here we report the crystal structure of pa-HO at 1.60 Å resolution and compare it to the 1.60 Å structure of nm-HO (6), which provides important insights into factors that control the unique regioselectivity of heme oxygenation by pa-HO. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Expression of pa-HO. The Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain carrying pWMZ1656 (pigA) was expressed as previously described (23). A single colony of freshly transformed cells was cultured overnight at 37 °C in 5 mL of LB medium containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin. The cells were subsequently subcultured into fresh LB-ampicillin medium (100 mL) and grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase. These cells were then subcultured (10 mL) into fresh LB-ampicillin medium (1 L), and upon reaching mid-log phase, expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM. The cells were grown further for 4 h at 28-30 °C and harvested by centrifugation (5500 rpm for 15 min). The resulting cell pellet was green due to the conversion of endogenous E. coli heme to biliverdin by the expressed pa-HO protein. Purification of pa-HO and Reconstitution with Heme. Purification of the recombinant pa-HO protein and its reconstitution with heme were carried out as previously

described (23). The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and the mixture was allowed to stir at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells next were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 18 000 rpm for 1 h. The soluble fraction was applied to a Sepharose-Q Fast Flow column (1.5 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.6). The column was washed with three volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and the protein was eluted in the same buffer by a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mM. Peak fractions were pooled together on the basis of SDS-PAGE analysis, and the purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6, 2 × 4 L) at 4 °C. Hemin was then added to the pa-HO sample at a final 2:1 heme:protein molar ratio, and the heme-pa-HO complex was applied to a Sepharose-Q Fast Flow column (1.5 × 6.0 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The column was washed with three volumes of 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.6), and the protein was eluted in the same buffer by a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mM. Peak fractions were pooled together and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) (2 × 4 L), and the sample was then applied to a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (3.0 × 100 cm) previously equilibrated in the same buffer. The final purified pa-HO protein was concentrated by Amicon filtration unit and stored at -80 °C. Crystal Growth and Data Collection. Optimized conditions for crystallization of pa-HO consisted of vapor diffusion with the reservoir containing 2.3 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.0% Jeffamine ED-600 (Fluka), and sitting drops consisted of 5 µL of reservoir buffer and 5 µL

Preparation of crystals suitable for cryogenic data collection required the use of D-(+)-trehalose as a cryoprotectant. Crystals were soaked by a three-step process into reservoir buffer containing increasing amounts of D-(+)trehalose to a final concentration of 30% (w/v) and flashfrozen by cold nitrogen stream. A 2.5 Å data set with high redundancy (250° scan) was collected in-house on an R-axis IV imaging plate equipped with a Rigaku RU-H3R X-ray generator and Osmic focusing optics. High-resolution diffraction data sets of pa-HO were collected on single crystals by use of synchrotron radiation of 1.0 Å wavelength at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA), beamline 5.0.1. Data sets consisted of 130 frames with a  rotation of 1°/frame. Data were integrated and scaled by use of HKL-2000 and SCALEPACK (33), with rejections performed with ENDHKL (Louis Sanchez, California Institute of Technology) in conjunction with SCALEPACK. Structure Solution and Refinement. The pa-HO structure was determined by the molecular replacement method by use of AMORE from the CCP4 suite (34). A search model was constructed from the protein moiety of nm-HO (PDB code 1J77) by mutating all residues to Ala. Rotation and translation function searches identified one solution with a correlation coefficient of 0.54 and R factor of 50.4% at 5.0 Å resolution. Packing analysis of all symmetry mates in the unit cell revealed some clashing between a surface loop of the nm-HO model and a neighboring molecule. Thus, the molecular replacement calculation was repeated after removal of the loop region (residues 90-100) from the search model. The final solution from AMORE was confirmed by observation of a 10 peak at the expected heme iron position, which was generated by an anomalous difference Fourier synthesis using model phases. To further improve the quality of the electron density maps, heme iron coordinates were provided to SHARP (35) for refinement of the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) phases from the 2.5 Å in-house data set. The SAD phases were then combined with the molecular replacement model phases and further modified by use of DM from the CCP4 suite, including solvent flattening and histogram matching. The electron density maps calculated from the combined phases were better quality than the maps calculated from the molecular replacement model phases alone. The protein side chains of a pa-HO model, as well as the truncated loop region, were built into the electron density maps with the program O (36). Early rounds of refinement with CNS (37) included rigid-body minimization, simulated annealing, and B-factor refinement. Electron density maps generated from a 1.60 Å data set were used for further refinement of the pa-HO structure to a final R factor of 0.235 and Rfree factor of 0.273. Backbone geometry was checked in PROCHECK (38), and none of the residues were in the disallowed region. During refinement, water molecules were manually added to the pa-HO structure in CNS and checked through visual inspection of their positions in both 2Fo Fc and Fo - Fc maps. In addition, one sulfate anion was assigned to the electron density. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OVerall Structure. The 1.60 Å crystal structure of pa-HO in a complex with heme has been solved by the molecular replacement method, with nm-HO as a search model. The first 11 residues of pa-HO are not ordered in the electron density map, and thus the pa-HO structure begins with Asn12 at the N-terminus and ends with Ala198 at the C-terminus. In nm-HO, the C-terminus wraps around toward the front of the active site, whereas the corresponding C-terminal region in pa-HO is not present due to a shorter amino acid sequence. Superimposition of the folds of nm-HO and pa-HO reveals that the two enzymes, as expected, share a homologous and largely R-helical fold (Figure 2), with an overall RMS deviation of 0.85 Å. In contrast, the overall RMS deviation between nm-HO and human HO-1 is 1.73 Å (6), indicating a higher degree of structural similarity between the two bacterial enzymes. Heme Coordination EnVironment. The heme iron is sixcoordinate with the imidazole group of His26 providing the

5242 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 18, 2004

Friedman et al. important for the catalytic mechanism (39, 40). With human HO-1, distinct differences are observed in the position of the distal helix relative to the heme in the two molecules of the asymmetric unit (4). One molecule has the distal helix further from the heme and has been termed the "open" conformation, while the other adopts a more "closed" conformation with the distal helix positioned closer to the heme. In addition, differences have been noted between the distal helix in human HO-1 and the highly homologous rat HO-1 (41, 42). 2Fo - Fc composite-omit electron density maps indicate that the heme and distal helix in pa-HO are well-ordered (Figure 4). By comparison with other known HO structures, the distal helix in the pa-HO structure adopts the closed conformation. Furthermore, the side-chain OH group of Ser117 in nm-HO and Ser122 in pa-HO forms hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone, which helps to stabilize the distal helix distortion. Throughout the distal helix region only one residue is not structurally conserved between nm-HO and pa-HO. As shown in Figure 5, Asn118 in nmHO points up and away from the heme but is replaced by Lys123 in pa-HO. In nm-HO there is a concerted motion of Asn118 and Arg77 in going from the Fe(II) to the Fe(II)NO structure. Asn118 swings up while Arg77 swings down to complete an H-bonded network with the iron-linked NO that is very likely important for catalysis (43). In pa-HO, Arg80 points down toward the heme as in the nm-HO Fe(II)-NO structure, and hence, Arg80 in pa-HO is already in the "activated" position. This difference is most likely due the replacement of Asn118 in nm-HO with Lys123 in pa-HO, which precludes, owing to potential steric clashes, the concerted motion observed in nm-HO. All known HO structures, including pa-HO, contain a network of hydrogen bonds within the distal heme pocket between key side chains and ordered solvent molecules. This rigid network of H-bonded water molecules ensures proper proton delivery to the distal O atom of the iron-bound O2 ligand and helps to stabilize the active HO hydroxylating

FIGURE 3: (A) Superimposition of the proximal and distal helices in nm-HO (blue) and pa-HO (red) (B) The distal helices both have 50° kink directly above the heme surface, which is introduced by the glycines of the highly conserved sequence Gly-Ser-X-LeuGly. This kink is thought to provide the flexibility required for binding of the heme substrate and release of the biliverdin product.

proximal heme ligand. The orientation of the His ligand ring also is the same in both structures, such that the plane of the imidazole ring roughly bisects the vectors defined by the pyrrole N-Fe-N bonds. In both nm-HO and pa-HO, a neighboring carboxylate can accept a hydrogen bond from the proximal His ligand. In nm-HO, Asp24 directly H-bonds with His23, but in pa-HO, Glu30 interacts with His26 through a bridging water molecule that is located 2.75 Å from the N atom of His26 and 2.89 Å from the O atom of Glu30. A similar bridging interaction was also identified in the crystal structure of cd-HO (7), involving Glu24, a nearby water molecule, and the proximal His20 ligand. A water molecule serves as the other axial ligand, consistent with previously reported spectroscopic and mutagenesis results (23, 28). The carbonyl oxygen of both Gly121 and Leu124 are within H-bonding distance of the distal water ligand, 3.21 and 2.87 Å, respectively. Distal Helix and Heme Pocket. Superimposition of the proximal and distal helices of nm-HO and pa-HO is shown in Figure 3A. An important structural feature identified in all heme oxygenases studied thus far is the distortion in the distal helix that covers part of the heme surface (Figure 3B). Such distortions and flexibility are generally considered

species, Fe(III)-OOH. In human HO-1, Thr135 and Asp140 directly participate in this H-bonded network, whereas residues of different size and charge are utilized in nm-HO and pa-HO (Figure 5). Although the active-site residues differ between bacterial and mammalian heme oxygenases, the close similarity in the H-bonded water networks suggests a common catalytic mechanism shared by all HO enzymes. Heme Orientation and Propionate Interactions. NMR studies of human HO-1 indicate that the heme has two orientations rotated by 180° along the R- meso axis (44). This is consistent with the observed hydroxylation of heme by pa-HO such that both the - and -meso heme carbons are oxidized with -meso hydroxylation favored (28). The 2Fo - Fc electron density for the heme methyl, vinyl, and propionate groups are well-defined, indicating a single heme orientation in the pa-HO crystal structure. The reason pa-HO gives a 70:30 mixture of -hydroxyand -hydroxyhemes, respectively, is readily understood from the pa-HO crystal structure. The heme in pa-HO is rotated by 100° such that the -heme edge is positioned toward the back end of the active-site pocket rather than the R-heme edge as in other HOs. Using NMR methods, Caignan et al. (28) also concluded that the heme in pa-HO is rotated 110° relative to the R-meso hydroxylating HOs. This structural difference is a result of different interactions between the protein and heme propionates. In nm-HO, these interactions involve Lys16 and Tyr112 (Lys18 and Tyr134 in human and

rat HO-1), but the corresponding residues in pa-HO are Asn19 and Phe117, respectively (Figure 6). Table 2 provides a list of heme-protein contacts in various HOs. Furthermore, there are no basic side chains in pa-HO that correspond to Lys179 and Arg183 in mammalian HO-1, which are important for proper heme positioning through charge interactions with the heme propionates (4, 41). Zhou et al. (32) showed that mutation of Arg183 in rat HO-1 leads to the formation of -biliverdin. One possible explanation presented by Zhou et al. is that the heme rotates in the active site (32). Interestingly, Trp158 in pa-HO occupies the space taken by Arg183 in mammalian HO-1 and may partly explain the unique -regioselectivity observed by pa-HO. As shown in Figure 6, Lys132 provides the key interaction with a heme propionate in pa-HO that stabilizes the heme in a unique orientation. On the basis of mutagenesis experiments, Fujii et al. (45) concluded that Lys34 in pa-HO may also hydrogen-bond with a heme propionate. The crystal structure of pa-HO indicates that Lys34 does not form a direct hydrogen bond with a heme propionate but may be close enough (6.3 Å) to provide a weak electrostatic interaction. The distance between the N atom of Lys132 and the heme 7-propionate is 2.8 Å and is thus the dominant interaction in pa-HO that controls -regioselectivity. Furthermore, the heme 1-methyl group is located 3.3 Å from Leu29, and the heme 8-methyl group is located within contact distance (4.2 Å) from the C atom of Val33. These two hydrophobic

rotation of the heme substrate about the R- meso axis (28), as previously observed in human HO-1 (44) and more recently in the crystal structure of bacterial cd-HO (7). CONCLUSIONS Given the close structural homology between the various HOs whose structures are known, it is reasonable to expect a common mechanism for the control of regioselecitivity. Three obvious factors related to regioselective hydroxylation are shared by all HOs. First, the distal helix blocks reaction with the iron-linked hydroperoxy intermediate at all but the meso heme carbon to be hydroxylated (Figure 7). Second, the distal helix favors bending of the Fe(III)-OOH intermediate toward the correct meso carbon. Third, the local solventprotein hydrogen-bonded network also favors bending of the Fe(III)-OOH toward the correct meso carbon in addition to providing the proton relay network required for oxygen activation. The main new insight in this study is that only minor alterations on the surface of HO can lead to different regioselective hydroxylation of the heme substrate. The nmHO and pa-HO structures are very similar, yet nm-HO gives the more common R-meso hydroxylated product while paHO hydroxylates primarily the -meso carbon. This difference is due to a rotation of the heme within a common activesite pocket. The heme orientation is controlled by the positioning of surface Lys and Arg residues that interact with the heme propionates. These interactions are very likely not strong since they occur on the surface where bulk solvent can provide a dielectric screen. A relatively loose association is actually an advantage since this ensures an energetically easier release of product under turnover conditions.
