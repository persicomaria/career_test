Received 3rd February 2009, Accepted 14th May 2009 First published as an Advance Article on the web 19th June 2009 DOI: 10.1039/b902284h Peptide-based 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds have emerged as potent inhibitors for serine proteases. Herein, we have designed and synthesized D-arabinose and D-trehalose-based esters, a-ketoesters and a-ketoamides, and evaluated their inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen 85C (ag85C), an acyltransferase in the serine hydrolase superfamily. In addition the compounds were evaluated for the ability to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 14 468, a non-pathogenic surrogate for Mtb. Among the synthetic analogs evaluated only the methyl ester 1 derived from D-arabinose was found to inhibit the acyltransferase activity of ag85C (IC50 = 25 mM). Based on this weak inhibitory activity it was not surprising that none of the compounds inhibits the growth of M. smegmatis. In spite of the weak inhibitory activity of 1, X-ray crystallography on crystals of ag85C soaked with 1 suggested the formation of a covalent ester adduct between 1 and the Ser124 side chain hydroxyl moiety found within the catalytic site of ag85C; however, some of the active site electron density appears to result from bound glycerol. The lack of activity associated with the a-ketoester and a-ketoamide derivatives of D-trehalose may be the result of intramolecular cyclization of the a-keto moiety with the nearby C-4/4 0 hydroxyls leading to the formation of stable bicyclo-ester and amide derivatives.

Introduction
An estimated 30% of the world's population is infected with tuberculosis (TB) and 1.7 million people die of the disease annually.1,2 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the main causative pathogen for this infection. The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extremely drug resistant (XDR) TB as well as co-infection with HIV poses new challenges for the treatment of this disease once thought to be under control.2 Therefore, an urgent need for new classes of anti-tubercular agents is obvious. One reason among several that Mtb is difficult to treat is the presence of a thick hydrophobic cell wall3­8 responsible for protecting the organism from foreign substances. The antigen 85 complex (ag85A-C)9 is believed to be responsible for the attachment of the hydrophobic mycolyl groups onto the cell wall of Mtb. In this work we explore potential inhibitors against the ag85s which represent potential targets for the development of new anti-tubercular agents. Ag85A-C are acyltransferases belonging to the a,b-hydrolase superfamily and convert trehalose 6-monomycolate (TMM) to trehalose 6,60 -dimycolate (TDM) and mycolate the peptidoglycan

bound D-arabino-D-galactan (AGP) to form mycolated AGP (mAGP), the major hydrophobic structure of the cell wall of Mtb.10­14 mAGP and other non-covalently bound glycolipids like TMM and TDM form an impermeable barrier to many hydrophilic drugs.15 Ag85C is the most active component of the ag85 complex largely responsible for cell wall mycolation.16­18 In our efforts19­21 to identify potential inhibitors of ag85s, we speculated that 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds such as a-ketoamides and a-ketoesters, known transition state inhibitors of related serine proteases, may have inhibitory activity against ag85s.22,23 The catalytic triad of serine proteases such as chymotrypsin and subtilisin contain a Ser-His-Asp24,25 charge-relay system similar to that of Ser-His-Glu system found in ag85s.26 A putative tetrahedral intermediate in the transfer of the mycolyl moiety from ag85s to the D-arabino-Dgalactan (AG) or TMM (not shown) is illustrated in Fig. 1A (Ser124 corresponds to Mtb ag85C numbering). At the onset of our study we proposed that the Ser124 nucleophile would be trapped by esters and a-keto compounds according to models shown in Fig. 1B and C, respectively. In the case of the a-keto compounds the enzyme-bound hemiketal could be stabilized through hydrogen bonding with the nearby amides known to stabilize the oxyanion present during acyltransfer (Fig. 1C). With these design features in mind, three different classes of carbonyl compounds consisting of methyl esters (1 and 4), a-ketoesters (2 and 5), and a-ketoamides (3 and 6) derived from b-D-arabinose and D-trehalose, respectively, were designed (Fig. 2). D-Arabinose and D-trehalose were chosen as templates

of the arabinose and trehalose-based carbonyl compounds and evaluate their ability to inhibit ag85C.

Results and discussion
To explore our hypothesis we synthesized esters 1 and 4, a-ketoesters 2 and 5, and a-ketoamides 3 and 6 (Fig. 2) starting from methyl b-D-arabinofuranoside and D-trehalose, respectively. The tritylated derivative 729 was first benzylated with benzyl bromide and sodium hydride in DMF to produce 8 in 81% yield and the product 8 was detritylated30 with 80% acetic acid at 70 1C to generate alcohol 931 in 83% yield. The hydroxymethyl moiety of 9 was oxidized quantitatively to an aldehyde by Swern conditions32 and the crude aldehyde33 was used directly in a Horner­Wadsworth­Emmons condensation32 in the presence of methyl diethylphosphonoacetate and sodium hydride in THF to produce a,b-unsaturated ester 10 (61% yield in two steps). Reduction of 10 with Pearlman's catalyst Pd(OH)2/C32 under H2 (1 atm) afforded the target ester 1 in 54% yield (Scheme 1). The a,b-unsaturated double bond of 10 was then selectively reduced with Wilkinson's catalyst (PPh3)3RhCl34 at 50 psi of H2 in THF to furnish 11 in 83% yield. Carboxylic acid 12 was generated in 73% yield when 11 was exposed to LiOH in THF­H2O. Subsequent coupling35 of 12 with (cyanomethylene)triphenylphosphorane36 in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3 0 -dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in CH2Cl2 produced a-keto-cyanophosphorane derivative 13 in 89% yield. DMDO oxidation37 of 13 in MeOH yielded 14 in high yield. Finally, the target a-ketoester 2 was obtained in 56% yield by hydrogenolysis of 14 using catalytic hydrogenation (10% Pd/C­H2 in THF) in good yield. Similarly, 13 was converted

for the inhibitor design since both are substrates for ag85. The target compounds were thought to be obtainable starting from an arabinose methyl glycoside or trehalose followed by modification at the hydroxymethyl moiety with either a methyl ester, a-ketoester, or an a-ketoamide. The methyl esters were expected to act as potential suicide substrates27 capable of forming a covalent adduct with serine at the Ser124 of ag85C while the 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds were expected to act as transition state inhibitors.28 Herein, we describe the synthesis

to 15 in 24% yield by DMDO oxidation in CH2Cl2 followed by amidation37 with butylamine at À78 1C. The target a-ketoamide 3 was accessed in 73% yield from 15 by Pd/C­H2 reduction32 (Scheme 1). a-D-Trehalose ester 4 was synthesized starting from D-trehalose (16). The first step of the synthesis was a regioselective silylation of C-6 and C-6 0 positions with tert-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride (TBDPSCl) in the presence of imidazole in DMF using standard conditions. The reaction at room temperature generated both mono- and di-silylated products 17 and 18, which were isolated as their benzylated derivatives 20 (24% yield) and 21 (31% yield) in the next step (Scheme 2). During benzylation of the mixture (17 and 18) with benzyl bromide and sodium hydride in DMF in the presence of tetrabutylammonium iodide, along with desired products 20 and 21, a minor amount of octa-O-benzyl-D-trehalose 1932 (8% yield) was isolated as the side product. However, compound 18 was

isolated in 84% yield when the silylation on 16 was performed at 35 1C under similar reaction conditions. Further, benzylation of the pure 18 produced the desired product 21 in 45% yield accompanied by 19 and 20 in 8% and 24% yields, respectively, as the undesired products. Next, the silyl protective groups of 21 were removed with tetrabutylammonium fluoride trihydrate (TBAFÁ3H2O) in THF to produce 2232 in 84% yield. Compound 22 was converted to 2332 in high yield by oxidation followed by Horner­Wadsworth­Emmons condensation using the previously described conditions. Methyl ester 4 was finally obtained in 79% yield by catalytic reduction32 with Pearlman's catalyst, Pd(OH)2/C, in anhydrous THF under H2 atmosphere. Regioselective reduction of a,b-unsaturated double bonds in 23 was accomplished with Wilkinson's catalyst, (PPh3)3RhCl,34 under 50 psi of H2 to afford 24 in 67% yield. An increased yield of 24 (84%) was obtained from 19 when flash column chromatography was carried out at the final step. Carboxylic acid 25 was generated in 95% yield when 24 was treated with LiOHÁH2O in THF­H2O (3 : 1). Compound 25 was coupled with (cyanomethylene)triphenylphosphorane36 by literature procedure35 in the presence of EDCI and DMAP in CH2Cl2 to generate 26 in 78% yield. Compound 26 when oxidized with DMDO37 in MeOH yielded a-ketoester 27 in 64% yield. Finally catalytic reduction on 27 using 10% Pd/C under H2 (1 atm) rendered 29 in 62% yield. Compound 30 was similarly obtained from 26, which was first oxidized to 28 in 46% yield with DMDO37 followed by treatment of butylamine in CH2Cl2 at À78 1C, and finally, catalytic reduction by 10% Pd/C under H2 on 28 produced desired 30 in 65% yield (Scheme 2). It appeared that under standard benzylation conditions 6,6 0 -di-O-silylated trehalose derivative 18 was not fully stable and underwent desilylation leading to the formation of fully benzylated trehalose derivative 19 and mono-silylated trehalose derivative 20 as the undesired products. We found that methyl esters 1 and 4 formed smoothly under the reaction conditions described above in both the arabinose and trehalose substrates with the ester carbonyl carbon appearing at d = 174.4 and 176.2 ppm in their respective 13C NMR. Characteristic carbonyl peaks of a-ketoester 2 (d = 161.4 ppm for ester carbonyl, and 193.9 ppm for a-keto carbonyl) and its amide congener 3 (d = 160.28 ppm for amide carbonyl, and 199.03 ppm for a-keto carbonyl) in their 13C NMR confirmed the presence of these two functional groups as expected. We employed the similar reaction conditions for accessing trehalose-derived a-ketoester 5 and its amide congener 6 from their precursors 27 and 28, respectively. To our surprise, due to proximity of hydroxyl groups at C-4/C-4 0 , bicyclo-ester 29 and its amide congener 30 formed readily during the palladium-charcoal reduction at the final step. As expected, no a-keto carbonyl was found around 200 ppm in either of 29 or 30 in the 13C NMR spectra of bicyclo-products 29 or 30. The carbonyl peak for a-keto-functionality of compound 29 was absent (see ESIz), rather an additional characteristic carbon peak at d = 95.4 ppm for C-8/C-8 0 appeared in the vicinity of the anomeric carbon, d = 95.9 (C-1/C-1 0 ). Similarly, a set of two adjacent carbon peaks at d = 94.8 and 94.9 ppm was found in 13C NMR of 30. A literature search

shows that the configuration at C-8/C-8 0 resembles the C-2 carbon of N-acetyl neuraminic acid, which appears at d = 96.4 ppm value.38 By comparing the d-value of C-8/C-8 0 with that for anomeric carbon of the acid, we concluded C-8/C-8 0 as having the similar configuration in both 29 and 30. Compounds 1­4, 8, 10­15, 18, 20, 21, 24­30 were further characterized by 1H, 1H­1H gCOSY, 13C NMR and HRMS. Arabinofuranoside analogs 1­3 and trehalose congeners 4, 29 and 30 were screened for their ability to inhibit M. smegmatis ATCC 14 468 using Kirby­Bauer disk diffusion assay.39 Isoniazid (INH) was used as a positive control and DMSO, the diluent, as a negative control. M. smegmatis ATCC 14 468 was used as a fast growing non-pathogenic surrogate for M. tuberculosis.40 The strain was previously used for screening antimycobacterial compounds.32,41 Unfortunately 1­4 and 29­30 showed no inhibitory activity against this organism. The in vitro activity of the synthetic compounds was evaluated using a recently developed ag85C acyltransferase assay.21 The trehalose-derived analogs (4 and 29­30) did not produce any inhibitory activity (Fig. 3; panel (a)). Among the arabinose-derived substrates, only methyl ester 1 showed inhibition of the enzymatic activity of ag85C at millimolar concentration (Fig. 3; panel (b)). When the enzyme was preincubated with 1 prior to the experiment, 50% inhibition of enzymatic activity was observed at 25 mM concentration of 1.

By comparison, 20% inhibition of the enzymatic activity was observed without incubation at the same inhibitor concentration. The time dependent nature of the results suggests weak binding between the enzyme and 1 leading to the formation of a covalent bond between the enzyme and the inhibitor. Because the low inhibitory activity of 1 required the use of relatively high concentrations to observe any inhibition, insufficient amounts were available for performing a thorough kinetic analysis. From the current data, it is not possible to ascertain the type of inhibition imparted by 1 on ag85C. Considering that 1 is structurally analogous to the true substrate, our continuing hypothesis is that it is a competitive inhibitor. Crystallographic studies of ag85C using the inhibitor to confirm this hypothesis are inconclusive (Table 1, PDB: 3HRH). Strong electron density is observed in the carbohydratebinding pocket of the enzyme, however, the identity of the compound or compounds producing this density is not known at this time. Two different compounds were added to the protein crystals and each of three different scenarios could represent the observed electron density. First, compound 1 could be binding within the active site and forming a covalent intermediate with the nucleophile Ser124. The density between Ser124 and the density within the carbohydrate-binding pocket is contiguous, indicating that a bond has been formed. Surprisingly, the positions of the catalytic triad residues do not deviate between this structure and the native form. If a bond is being formed, this result seemingly contradicts our previous contention that the conformational change seen in the ag85C-DEP (diethylphosphate) structure is induced upon formation of the covalent bond between the Ser124 nucleophile and the substrate/inhibitor. However, it is possible that within the context of the protein crystal the propensity of the enzyme to undergo a conformational change is not sufficient to overcome the lattice energy of the crystal. The second scenario is that the electron density corresponds to glycerol. In the previous structure of ag85C, no electron density resembling glycerol was observed in the carbohydratebinding pocket. However, in those previous studies, the crystal was exposed to glycerol for less than 10 seconds before flash cooling to 100 K. In preparing the sample for this diffraction study, the crystal was incubated in a solution containing both glycerol at a final concentration of 20% v/v and 1 for an extended period of time. It is likely that the significantly higher

concentration of glycerol in the cryo-protecting solution promoted the displacement of 1 from the active site, leaving the glycerol bound within that same site. This presumes that no covalent bond is formed between the inhibitor and the enzyme. This scenario is strengthened by the fact that the current structure exhibits no change in the active site. The third explanation is that the electron density represents a combination of both previously mentioned states, where glycerol and 1 are bound at less than 100% occupancy. Considering all of the available information, multiple glycerol molecules were placed within the enzyme active site (Fig. 4A). While the structure lacking 1 is disappointing, the information garnered from that structure still offers important insights to how ag85C can interact with various carbohydrates. To better understand how 1 may inhibit ag85C activity, the available electron density from the current crystal structure was used as a basis for modeling 1 within the carbohydrate-binding pocket (Fig. 4B). The most reasonable explanation is that the binding energy between protein molecules required for crystal packing cannot be overcome by formation of the covalent bond in the active site. This lack of an observed conformational change offers the advantage of understanding the interactions between the carbohydrate-binding site of ag85C and potential substrates and inhibitors.

result it appears difficult to install a-ketoester and a-ketoamide functionalities in trehalose substrates due to this substratecontrolled intramolecular cyclization phenomenon. In an ag85C acyltransferase assay among the synthetic analogs 1­4, 29 and 30, only methyl ester derivative of D-arabinofuranoside 1 has emerged with moderate inhibitory activity against ag85C at 25 mM concentration under preincubation conditions. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, compounds 1­4, 29 and 30 showed no antibacterial activity against M. smegmatis ATCC 14 468. Finally, the results from co-crystallization and X-ray diffraction studies of ag85C with 1, while ambiguous, offer hints for designing more potent inhibitors possessing improved binding affinity and specificity for the antigen 85 active site.

Experimental section
General method Starting materials such as D-arabinose and D-trehalose, and all fine chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. All solvents were obtained from Fisher and used as received. Silica (230­400 mesh) for flash column chromatography was obtained from Sorbent Technologies; thin-layer chromatography (TLC) precoated plates were from EMD. TLCs (silica gel 60, f254) were visualized under UV light or by charring (5% H2SO4­MeOH). Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (230­400 mesh) using solvents as received. 1H NMR were recorded either on a Varian VXRS 400 MHz or an INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3, CD3OD or DMSO-d6 using residual CHCl3, CH3OH and DMSO as internal references, respectively. 13C NMR were recorded on a Varian VXRS 100 MHz or Varian INOVA 150 MHz in CDCl3 using the triplet centered at d 77.3, in CD3OD, using the septet centered at d 49.0 or in DMSO-d6 using septet as internal references, respectively. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on a Micromass Q-TOF2 instrument.

Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized an arabinose-based ester, a-ketoester and a-ketoamide, as designed. Under the similar reaction conditions, a trehalose-based ester was prepared smoothly. Due to proximity of the hydroxyl functionality close to the a-keto moiety in the trehalose series the a-ketoester and a-ketoamide cyclized at the final step, and bicyclo-products were isolated in each case. To the best of our knowledge, the observation is the first to show the formation of a bicyclo-derivative in trehalose-based compounds, which might open up an avenue for accessing synthetically challenging analogs of the compound class.

Benzyl bromide (0.7 mL, 5.93 mmol) was added dropwise and the resulting solution was stirred at ambient temperature. The reaction was monitored by TLC and appeared complete after 7 h. Two to three ice-cubes were added into the reaction mixture and the solution was stirred for 15 min to hydrolyze the excess reagents. The reaction mixture was diluted with 50 mL water and aqueous layer was extracted with ether (3 Â 40 mL). Combined organic layer was dried (anhydrous Na2SO4) and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to get a crude material, which was purified by silica gel flash column chromatography (230­400 mesh; 10 Â 5.5 cm) using 1 : 9 (250 mL) and then 1 : 4 (750 mL) EtOAc­hexanes to produce 8 as a yellow gum: yield 1.01 g (81%); Rf = 0.46 (1 : 4 EtOAc­hexanes); 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): d 3.18­3.24 (m, 2 H, H-5/H-5 0 ), 3.22 (s, 3 H, OMe), 4.03 (dd, 1 H, J = 4.2, 6.6 Hz, H-2), 4.07 (dd, 1 H, J = 6.0, 10.8 Hz, H-4), 4.12 (t, 1 H, J = 7.2 Hz, H-3), 4.55 (d, 1 H, J = 11.4 Hz, benzylic), 4.61 (m, 3 H, benzylic), 4.69 (d, 1 H, J = 4.2 Hz, H-1), 7.21 (m, 5 H, aromatic), 7.27 (m, 10 H, aromatic), 7.34 (m, 4 H, aromatic), 7.46 (m, 6 H, aromatic); 13C NMR (150 MHz, CDCl3): d 55.1 (OMe), 66.0 (C-5), 72.6 (CH2), 72.7 (CH2), 80.6 (C-4), 82.8 (C-3), 84.2 (C-2), 101.5 (C-1), 127.2, 127.7, 127.8, 128.0, 128.1, 128.3, 128.5, 128.6, 128.9, 137.8, 138.24, 144.1; mass spectrum (ESI-MS), m/z = 367.1493 (M + Na À Tr)+ (C20H24NaO5 requires 367.1521). Methyl 2,3-di-O-benzyl-b-D-arabinofuranoside (9)31 Compound 8 (1.04 g, 1.77 mmol) was dissolved in 80% AcOH­H2O and the resulting mixture was stirred at 70 1C following a literature procedure.27 TLC showed no starting material after 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with 100 mL water and aqueous layer was extracted with ether (4 Â 40 mL). The organic phase was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 until pH = neutral (checked by pH paper) followed by brine. The ether layer was dried (anhydrous Na2SO4) and filtered.

Kirby­Bauer disk diffusion assay Disk diffusion assays were adopted from methods described by Wang et al. and the NCCLS.32,40 M. smegmatis ATCC 14 468 was inoculated into Middlebrook 7H9 containing 0.2% glycerol and ADC enrichment, respectively. The inocula were incubated at 37.5 1C for approximately 24 h and 160 rpm to yield OD600 = 0.27. The bacteria were plated on agar (Middlebrook 7H10 containing 0.5% glycerol and OADC enrichment) using a cotton-tipped applicator. Concentration of 20 mg mLÀ1 of each synthetic analog and 500 mg mLÀ1 of INH were prepared in DMSO and 10 mL of each solution was applied to 6 mm sterile paper disks. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 1C. The diameter of zone of inhibition (DZI) was measured using a ruler. Antigen 85C acyltransferase assay The components of the assay were prepared as described previously.21 The acyl donor solution in DMSO (50­175 mM) was added to the well followed by buffer and the tested compound. A master mix was prepared with 2 U of beta-glucosidase, 3 mM of D-glucose, 150 nM of antigen 85C for each reaction and buffer for a total volume of 100 mL. To start the reaction, the master mix was added to the well. The reaction was followed by UV-vis spectrophotometry. The release of the signaling molecule, p-nitrophenolate, was monitored by measurement of the absorbance at 405 nm every 30 s for 30 min. The data from three independent experiments were exported from SoftMaxs Pro5 and analyzed in GraphPad Prism 5s. For the arabinosylfuranoside methyl ester, the enzyme was incubated with the compound prior to the experiment. In that particular case, the experimental procedure was modified as follows. In each well, 175 mM of the acyl donor in solution in DMSO were added, followed by buffer. A master mix was prepared with, for each reaction, 2 U of beta-glucosidase, 3 mM of D-glucose, 150 nM of antigen 85C preincubated, if necessary, with the desired concentration of inhibitor and buffer for a total volume of 100 mL. To start the reaction, the master mix was added to the well. The percent initial velocity was calculated by dividing the value obtained in the presence of inhibitor (with or without preincubation) by the value obtained in the absence of inhibitor. Method of crystallization The crystal used to solve the structure was obtained by soaking experiment. Antigen 85C was crystallized in a solution of 0.3 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH = 4.5). A solution of 0.05 M of methyl ester 1 was prepared and 1 mL was added to the crystallization drop (4 mL) containing the crystals for a final concentration of 10 mM of 1. A solution identical to the crystallization solution was prepared with 20% (w/v) of glycerol. The crystals were briefly soaked into this solution before being flash-frozen in the liquid nitrogen cryo stream.

The data were collected at beamline 23 GM-CA/CAT at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. ° The data were collected at a wavelength of 1 A and was integrated using the HKL2000 program.42 The crystals were isomorphous with the crystal leading to the native structure (accession code 1dqz).26,43 Using this structure, a difference Fourier map was calculated in CNS version 1.2.44,45 Simulated annealing, energy minimization, and B-factor refinement in CNS were used to refine the structure. Fo­Fc maps calculated using this partially refined model exhibited additional electron density contiguous with residue S124 and extending into the known carbohydrate-binding pocket of the ag85C active site.43 The methyl ester arabinofuranoside model was built in Pymol and incorporated into the model using Coot and CNS.46 Energy minimization and B-factor refinement, followed by the addition of solvent, produced the final model.
