The GCN4 Leucine Zipper can Functionally Substitute for the Heat Shock Transcription Factor's Trimerization Domain

University of California Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, 229 Stanley Hall #3206, Berkeley, CA 947203206, USA The heat shock transcription factor (HSF) is the only known sequencespeci®c, homotrimeric DNA-binding protein. HSF binds to a DNA recognition site called a heat shock element (HSE), which contains varying numbers of nGAAn units (``GAA boxes'') arranged in inverted repeats. To investigate the role of trimerization on HSF's DNA-binding properties, we replaced the trimerization domain, which self-assembles to form a three-stranded a-helical coiled coil, with the GCN4 leucine zipper, which forms a two-stranded a-helical coiled coil. Surprisingly, this substitution did not effect the ability of HSF to function in vivo. Biochemical studies of an HSF-leucine zipper chimera in comparison to an HSF truncation show that the HSF-leucine zipper chimera, though dimeric in solution and dimeric when bound to a two-box HSE, forms a trimeric complex when bound to a three-box HSE. The ability to form trimers depends on the presence of three contiguous GAA boxes present in inverted repeats. The proximity of the leucine zippers due to the orientation of the binding sites suggests that the leucine zippers might be forming a three-stranded coiled coil and several experiments lend support to this model. The ability of the leucine zipper to change oligomeric states in context might explain why the leucine zipper can replace the trimerization domain of HSF in vivo.

Introduction
Oligomerization is critical to the function of many DNA-binding proteins. Not only does it increase the af®nity of a DNA-binding protein by allowing two or more subunits to bind cooperatively, but it also works in conjunction with the spatial organization of the binding site to promote highly speci®c binding. For example, in the GAL4 binuclear zinc cluster family, changes in the oligomerization domain (as well as the linker region) allow the members to differentiate between sites

spaced at different intervals (Reece & Ptashne, 1993; Liang et al., 1996). In many cases, the oligomerization domain can be substituted with another of a similar oligomeric status. For example, the dimerization domains of lambda and lexA repressors can be functionally substituted by the GCN4 dimerization domain (Hu et al., 1990; OertelBuchheit et al., 1993), the prototypical two-stranded coiled coil, also known as a ``leucine zipper'' (Landschulz et al., 1989; O'Shea et al., 1989). In addition, the p53 tetramerization domain must be replaced with a tetrameric coiled coil motif for full function (Waterman et al., 1996). In DNA-binding proteins, coiled coils are important for oligomerization, as well as proper positioning of the protein on DNA (Lupas, 1996). Thus, we were surprised to ®nd that the trimerization domain of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) could be functionally replaced by the GCN4 dimerization domain. HSF is responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the eukaryotic heat shock response, or stress response (for a review, see Wu, 1995). HSF

62 has been cloned from several eukaryotic species, and the DNA-binding and oligomerization characteristics of this protein appear to be evolutionarily conserved. One of the most intriguing aspects about HSF is its trimeric nature. HSF is the only known example of a homotrimeric, sequencespeci®c DNA-binding protein. The trimerization domain of HSF is thought to form a three-stranded a-helical coiled coil (Peteranderl & Nelson, 1992). This would give the trimeric complex an unusual 3-fold symmetry, in comparison to the 2-fold symmetry seen for dimerization domains such as the leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix motifs (O'Shea et al., 1991; Ellenberger et al., 1992; Ferre-D'Amare et al., 1993, 1994; Konig & Richmond, 1993; Ma et al., 1994), the 4-fold symmetry seen for the p53 tetramerization domain (Jeffrey et al., 1995), or the double dyad symmetry seen for the Lac repressor tetramerization domain (Friedman et al., 1995). HSF recognizes and binds to arrays of a 5 bp DNA consensus sequence, nGAAn, arranged in inverted repeats (Amin et al., 1988; Xiao & Lis, 1988; Cunniff et al., 1991). The n can be any nucleotide, although HSF binds with highest af®nity when the nucleotide 5H to the GAA is adenine (Cunniff & Morgan, 1993; Fernandes et al., 1994; Kroeger & Morimoto, 1994). The consensus repeat is referred to as a GAA box and the arrays are heat shock elements, or HSEs. The relationship between the size of the box (5 bp), the helical repeat of DNA ($10.5 bp), and the inverted nature of the repeats, positions all of the GAA boxes within an HSE on the same side of the double helix, with alternate GAA boxes oriented in opposite directions (Figure 1). A single HSF DNA-binding domain interacts with each GAA box (Kim et al., 1994). A trimer of HSF would therefore optimally associate with a three-box site, nGAAnnTTCnnGAAn, and this is the minimal site necessary for transcriptional activation in vivo (Amin et al., 1988, 1994; Xiao & Lis, 1988; Cunniff et al., 1991). Nevertheless, a trimer of HSF can also bind to a two-box site in vitro (Perisic et al., 1989). HSF can recognize either arrangement of a two-box site, nGAAnnTTCn (head-to-head) or nTTCnnGAAn (tail-to-tail). In addition, it can also contact the two-box sequence nGAAnnNNNnnGAAn, called a skipped-box, because the appropriate periodicity between the two boxes is preserved (Xiao et al., 1991). Footprinting experiments suggest that the third, or extra, subunit of HSF does not contact DNA directly in these complexes (Xiao et al., 1991; Fernandes et al., 1994). The af®nity for all three types of two-box sites is nearly the same, although substantially lower than that for a three-box site (Xiao et al., 1991). Typical heat shock promoters contain two or more HSEs of two to six repeats each, suggesting possible protein-protein interactions beyond those within the trimer (Cunniff et al., 1991; Chen & Pederson, 1993; Amin et al., 1994; Bonner et al., 1994; Kroeger & Morimoto, 1994; Wang & Morgan, 1994; Giardina & Lis, 1995). Indeed, trimers of HSF bound at two distal

binding sites can interact and form a DNA loop (Wyman et al., 1995). HSF is required for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sorger & Pelham, 1988; Wiederrecht et al., 1988). Deletion analyses have shown that the domain structure of HSF is complicated, with N-terminal and C-terminal activation domains, as well as a DNA-binding, linker and trimerization domain located between the two activation domains (Nieto et al., 1990; Sorger, 1990; Flick et al., 1994). The DNA-binding domain, linker region, and at least one transcriptional activation domain are required for HSF activity; deletion of either activation domain results in a partially functional HSF. Deletion of only the trimerization domain results in a minimally functional HSF, while deletion of the trimerization domain and the C-terminal activation domain results in an inactive HSF. Therefore, the minimum amount of the HSF gene required for viability includes the N-terminal activation domain, DNA-binding domain, and linker region, as well as the trimerization domain (Nieto et al., 1990; Sorger, 1990; Flick et al., 1994). In order to better understand the role of trimerization in HSF function, we studied the effect of replacing the HSF trimerization domain with the leucine zipper of GCN4, a two-stranded coiled coil (O'Shea et al., 1989, 1991). For convenience, we used the minimal HSF consisting of the N-terminal activation domain, DNA-binding domain, linker region, and trimerization domain. We found that replacement of the trimerization domain with the leucine zipper results in an HSF that is still functional in vivo at physiological temperatures. This led us to investigate whether the chimeric complex was binding as a dimer or a trimer. We compared the behavior in vitro of an HSF-GCN4 chimeric protein (containing the DNA-binding domain and linker of S. cerevisiae HSF fused to the GCN4 leucine zipper) to that of an HSF truncation (containing the DNA-binding domain, linker, and trimerization domain of S. cerevisiae HSF). This truncation has all of the DNA-binding and oligomerization properties of full-length HSF (Sorger & Pelham, 1987; Sorger & Nelson, 1989; Rye et al., 1993; Flick et al., 1994; Wyman et al., 1995). Although the oligomeric state of the chimeric protein in solution, monomeric or dimeric, is dependent on protein concentration, our results show that the oligomeric state of the DNA-bound chimeric protein is dependent on the number and orientation of GAA boxes within the binding site:

on a three-box HSE, the HSF-leucine zipper chimera can bind as a trimer and as multimers of trimers. Additional experiments support the idea that the leucine zipper domain forms a threestranded coiled coil when the chimeric protein is bound to a three-box HSE. The ability of the leucine zipper to change oligomeric states in context might explain why the leucine zipper can replace the trimerization domain of HSF in vivo.

Results
Substitution of leucine zipper for HSF trimerization domain in vivo Although HSF is a required gene in yeast, not all of the gene is required for viability (Sorger & Pelham, 1988; Wiederrecht et al., 1988). A C-terminal deletion of HSF, leaving the N-terminal activation domain, DNA-binding domain, linker and trimerization domain is viable at 30 C (Nieto et al., 1990; Sorger, 1990). Further deletion into the trimerization domain, however, will not support growth at any temperature (Sorger, 1990). The linker in S. cerevisiae HSF has two parts: a conserved 21 amino acid residue region that is required for function and a unique 53 residue region that is not required for viability of the full-length HSF (Flick et al., 1994) and, as shown below, is not required for viability of the C-terminal deletion. For testing viability in vivo, we compared two HSF-leucine zipper chimeras to their corresponding HSF fragments. Figure 2(b) illustrates the four different proteins. ND(73L)T contains amino acid residues 1 to 424 of S. cerevisiae HSF, including the N-terminal activation domain, DNA-binding domain, 73 amino acid residue Linker (conserved and unique parts of the linker), and Trimerization domain; ND(21L)T contains amino acid residues 1 to 280 and 333 to 424, including the N-terminal activation domain, DNA-binding domain, 21 amino acid residue Linker (conserved part of the linker), and Trimerization domain. ND(73L)Z contains amino acid residues 1 to 332 of HSF (including the N-terminal activation domain, DNAbinding domain and 73 amino acid residue Linker) fused to the leucine Zipper, and ND(21L)Z contains amino acid residues 1 to 280 (including the N-terminal activation domain, DNA-binding domain and 21 amino acid Linker) fused to the leucine Zipper. All four expression constructs have the HSF fragment or chimera expressed from the HSF promoter; these constructs were transformed individually into the yeast strain PS145 (Sorger & Pelham, 1988), whose sole HSF expression is driven from a GAL4 promoter. The transformed cells were then grown in glucose in order to turn off expression of the full-length HSF expressed from the GAL4 promoter and test the dependence of growth on the HSF truncations and chimeric proteins. All four yeast strains had identical growth phenotypes: they were all viable at 30 C (Figure 3, left). At 37 C, all the yeast were temperature-sensi-

The amino acid boundaries for the DNA-binding domain (170 and 259) and the trimerization domain (333 and 424) are marked along with the N and C termini (1 and 833). (b) Constructs used for the in vivo experiments. ND(73L)T is a truncation of S. cerevisiae HSF from residues 1 to 424; ND(21L)T is a truncation of S. cerevisiae HSF from residues 1 to 424 with a 52 amino acid residue deletion (281 to 332); ND(73L)Z is a fusion between residues 1 to 332 of S. cerevisiae HSF and the leucine zipper of GCN4; and ND(21L)Z is a fusion between residues 1 to 280 from S. cerevisiae HSF and the leucine zipper of GCN. (c) Constructs used for the in vitro experiments. D(21L)T is a truncation of S. cerevisiae HSF from residues 170 to 424 with a 52 amino acid residue deletion (281 to 332); and D(21L)Z is a fusion between residues 1 to 280 from S. cerevisiae HSF and the leucine zipper of GCN4.

tive (Figure 3, right). Therefore, the leucine zipper can functionally substitute for the trimerization domain in vivo. Oligomerization of HSF leucine zipper chimera in vitro In order to study the oligomerization of the HSF-leucine zipper chimera in vitro, we compared two protein fragments: D(21L)T, an HSF truncation containing the DNA-binding domain, conserved 21 amino acid residue Linker and Trimerization domain; and D(21L)Z, an HSF-leucine zipper chimera containing the DNA-binding domain and conserved 21 amino acid residue Linker from HSF fused to the leucine Zipper of GCN4. The fragment D(21L)T has the same DNA-binding and oligomerization characteristics as the full-length protein (Sorger et al., 1987; Sorger & Nelson, 1989; Flick et al., 1994), and the protein is better behaved in solution than the truncation including the unique

linker region (unpublished results). A diagram of these two constructs is shown in Figure 2(c). To determine their oligomeric state, the proteins were reacted with EGS (ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate)), a homobifunctional cross-linking reagent, and then run on an SDS-PAGE gel. The calculated molecular masses of D(21L)T and D(21L)Z are 22.2 kDa and 15.8 kDa, respectively. Monomers of both proteins migrate slower in SDSPAGE gels than their calculated molecular masses, and thus it was expected that the multimers would migrate slower as well. Cross-linking of D(21L)T produces complexes that migrated on an SDSPAGE gel with mobilities comparable to monomers (approximately 24 kDa), dimers (48 kDa), and trimers (72 kDa), as shown in Figure 4(a). Crosslinking of D(21L)Z produces a doublet complex with a mobility comparable to a dimer of this protein (approximately 34 kDa), as shown in Figure 4(b). The reasons for the doublet formation are not understood. Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to con®rm the oligomeric state in solution of each of these proteins. For D(21L)T, the molecular mass as determined by sedimentation equilibrium at a loading concentration of 2 mM is 65.8(Æ2.4) kDa, in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 66.6 kDa for a trimeric complex. The molecular mass of D(21L)Z complexes as determined by sedimentation equilibrium at loading concentrations of 2 to 10 mM is 32.1(Æ1.2) kDa, which is in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass for a D(21L)Z dimer (31.6 kDa). Therefore, both cross-linking and ultracentrifugation show that replacement of the HSF trimerization domain with the leucine zipper of GCN4 changes the oligomeric state of the protein in the micromolar to millimolar solution concentrations from a trimer to a dimer, as expected. DNA-binding properties in vitro depend on the size of the binding site We had previously shown that HSF will bind to DNA in a complexes larger than a trimer as protein concentration is increased (Sorger et al., 1987;

Sorger & Nelson, 1989). Direct stoichiometric determination using a two-color ¯uorescent gel mobility shift assay con®rmed that the ®rst complex formed was a trimer (Rye et al., 1993; Drees et al., 1996). The larger, multimeric complexes were formed by addition of trimeric units, making hexamers, nonamers, etc. The mobility of these complexes is dependent only on the number of HSF subunits and not on the number of GAA boxes (Rye et al., 1993). D(21L)Z also forms multiple complexes on the DNA as the protein concentration is increased, but the mobility of the type of D(21L)Z/DNA complexes depends on the number of GAA boxes in the binding site. Puri®ed D(21L)Z was incubated with fragments of DNA containing HSEs of different sizes, shown

65 phoretic mobilities in comparison to other complexes, these lower mobility complexes that are formed on a three-box site are likely to be two trimers or a hexamer. It is interesting that the HSFleucine zipper chimeras form multimeric complexes in a manner analogous to that of the HSF truncations, which forms multimers of trimers as protein concentration is increased (Rye et al., 1993; Drees et al., 1996). Direct determination of the stoichiometry of the protein-DNA complexes To determine if the ®rst D(21L)Z/DNA complex formed on a three-box site is actually trimeric, we calculated the stoichiometry of D(21L)Z/DNA complexes on two-box and three-box sites in the same two-color ¯uorescent gel shift assays used to study the HSF truncation (Rye et al., 1993). Sitedirected mutagenesis was used to change the lysine residue at position 28 of the GCN4 leucine zipper to cysteine and to construct a new HSFGCN4 chimeric protein containing this amino acid change. This residue is in the f position of the coiled coil (O'Shea et al., 1991), opposite the helical interface; a ¯uorescein label in this position should be exposed to solvent and should not interfere with the formation of a coiled coil. The new chimeric protein, named D(21L)ZSH, was site-speci®cally labeled with ¯uorescein-5-maleimide, a sulfhydryl-speci®c labeling reagent. The labeled protein, D(21L)ZS-Fl, was used in two-color ¯uorescent gel shift assays in which the DNA was labeled with the intercalating ``energy transfer'' dye TOTIN5 (Benson et al., 1995). DNA fragments of 500 base-pairs in length were used in the binding reactions so that the long stretches of non-speci®c DNA ¯anking the HSE sequences would provide space for several dye molecules to intercalate, resulting in a strong ¯uorescent signal, without blocking the HSF binding site. The DNA to dye ratio used was 40 base-pairs per dye molecule, a concentration that has been shown to be low enough that dye intercalation does not interfere with protein binding (Rye et al., 1993). The molar amount of DNA fragment in each proteinDNA complex was quanti®ed by comparing its signal to that of known amounts of dye-labeled DNA in a fX174 HaeIII digest run on the same gel. The amount of D(21L)ZS-Fl in each complex was measured by comparing its ¯uorescein emission to that of known amounts of native D(21L)ZS-Fl in microtiter wells. To observe any changes in the ¯uorescence of labeled protein caused by DNAbinding, we measured the ¯uorescence of known amounts of D(21L)ZS-Fl incubated with molar excess amounts of DNA (Drees et al., 1996). The ¯uorescence emission of D(21L)ZS-Fl did not appear to be changed by binding to its speci®c site on DNA (data not shown). The results of these ¯uorescently double-labeled gel shift assays are that D(21L)Z/DNA complex has an average protein:to DNA ratio of 2.09 Æ 0.54 for a two-box site and an

in Figure 5(a), and run in gel shift assays. Figure 5(b) illustrates the complexes formed by D(21L)Z binding to HSEs of two and three GAA boxes. Comparison of lanes 2 and 7 shows that the size of the most prominent complex formed at the lowest protein concentration decreases in mobility as the number of GAA boxes increases. Since D(21L)Z forms dimers in solution, we expected it to bind DNA as a dimer, like GCN4 itself (Hope & Struhl, 1987). The simplest interpretation is therefore that D(21L)Z is binding as a dimer to a tail-totail two-box site at low protein concentrations (Figure 5(b), lane 2). As protein concentration increases, a complex is formed that is likely to be two dimers or a tetramer (Figure 5(b), lanes 3 to 5). The same complexes are formed on a head-to-head orientation of a two-box site (compare Figure 5(b), lanes 1 to 5, with Figure 7(b), lanes 1 to 3), as well as for a skipped box orientation of a two-box site containing the sequence aGAAtaaggtaGAAa (data not shown). On a three-box site at low protein concentration, the most prominent complex has a mobility between those of the putative dimer and tetramer complexes (compare Figure 5(b), lanes 7 to 5). Again, the simplest interpretation is that D(21L)Z is binding to a three-box site predominantly as a trimer with a minor amount of dimeric complex that decreases with increasing protein concentration. At higher protein concentrations, complexes that migrate more slowly are seen (Figure 5(b), lanes 8 to 10). Based on their electro-

average ratio of 3.32 Æ 0.36 for a three-box site. Thus, the chimeric protein is binding to a two-box site as a dimer and to a three-box site as a trimer. Binding affinities on two-box and threebox HSEs The binding af®nities of the truncated HSF and the HSF-GCN4 chimeric proteins for a three-box site and for different arrangements of two-box sites were compared. The results show that the ability to trimerize in solution greatly increases HSF's af®nity for a three-box site, but not for any arrangement of two-box sites. Puri®ed proteins were titrated against the four HSEs shown in Figure 6(a) in gel shift assays. Figure 6(b) illustrates the binding curves for D(21L)T to each of these sites. The HSF trimer binds all arrangements of a two-box site with an apparent Kd of approximately 40 nM, but binds the three-box site with a 20-fold higher af®nity of approximately 2 nM. As shown in Figure 6(c), the HSF-GCN4 chimeric protein

D(21L)Z binds all arrangements of a two-box site with an apparent Kd of approximately 40 nM, and binds the three-box site with only twofold higher af®nity of 20 nM. In contrast, the DNA-binding domain alone binds a three-box site with at least 100 times lower af®nity, with a Kd greater than 5 mM (Flick et al., 1994). Trimerization of the HSF truncation has an association constant of at least 10À16 M2 (Drees et al., 1996), and is mostly trimeric under the conditions used in the binding assays. The fact that D(21L)T has different af®nities for the two-box and three-box HSEs suggests that the presence of a third GAA box in the binding site increases HSF's binding af®nity by providing speci®c DNA contacts for all three trimer subunits. Trimer binding may also be stabilized by protein-protein interactions between trimer subunits (Xiao et al., 1991). At the concentrations used in the binding assays, the leucine zipper is thought to exist primarily as a disordered monomer (O'Shea et al., 1989; Weiss, 1990; Thompson et al., 1993). Because the DNAbinding domain of S. cerevisiae is monomeric at all concentrations in the absence of DNA (unpublished results), we expect the protein D(21L)Z to be mostly monomeric in the range of concentrations used in our gel shift assays. In the presence of a two-box HSE, D(21L)Z associates to form a dimer upon binding to DNA; a third GAA box provides additional speci®c contacts that allow it to bind DNA as a trimer. This might induce the GCN4 leucine zipper to form a three-stranded coiled coil or other trimeric association. Since the wild-type leucine zipper has never been seen to form such a structure in solution, it is likely that the induced structure is inherently unstable compared to the usual two-stranded coiled coil. While the availability of additional speci®c DNA contacts favors binding and trimerization of D(21L)Z on three-box HSE, the inherent instability of the induced trimeric structure would make binding to this site unfavorable compared to binding a two-box site. We suggest that these forces are approximately balanced, with the result that D(21L)Z binds the three-box site as a trimer with only twofold higher af®nity than it binds two-box sites as a dimer. An analogous type of energetic balance has been proposed for a leucine zipper oligomeric switch (Gonzalez et al., 1996a). Requirements for HSE arrangements To ®nd out what characteristics of the heat shock element sequence are necessary to induce the HSE-leucine zipper chimera to bind as a trimer, we compared the complexes formed by D(21L)Z binding on two-box and three-box HSEs and on a ``2  1`` element, which contains a palindromic two-box site plus a third GAA box situated ®ve base-pairs away. HSF can bind speci®cally to interrupted arrays of GAA boxes if the ®ve base-pair periodicity of the GAA repeats is preserved (Amin et al., 1988; Xiao et al., 1991). The sites used are

DNA-Dependent Oligomerization States

67 boxes are no longer in orientation and instead there are two direct repeats (Figure 7(c)). Figure 7(d) compares the complexes formed on this site relative to a normal three-box HSE and shows that the chimera binds as a dimer to the variant HSE and the trimeric complex is observed only on the HSE that contains three GAA boxes in alternating repeats. Similar results were seen with the sequence aTTCtaTTCtaGAAt (data not shown). Therefore, formation of the trimeric D(21L)Z/DNA complex not only requires three GAA boxes available for binding, but also requires a speci®c arrangement of boxes in the site. Does the chimera form a three-stranded coiled coil? The dependence on three contiguous and inverted repeats of GAA boxes for formation of a trimeric complex by the HSF-leucine zipper chimera suggests that proximity is required for trimer formation and supports the idea that a direct interaction between subunits is necessary. There are several models that can be proposed, but we will concentrate on the two most obvious ones: (a) interaction occurring via the leucine zippers with formation of a three-stranded coiled coil; or (b) cooperative interactions between adjacent DNAbinding domains. While it is dif®cult to prove the ®rst model (illustrated by Figure 8(a)), one can propose experiments to disprove the second model (illustrated schematically in Figure 8(b)). The second model would propose that two of the three subunits bound to a three-box site would dimerize via a two-stranded coiled coil while the leucine zipper part of the third protein was free. This suggests two testable hypotheses: (i) the DNA-bound complex would have a ``free'' and accessible leucine zipper; and (ii) a heteromeric complex could be formed with both HSF-leucine zipper chimeras and free HSF DNA-binding domains bound to DNA. If the complex of the chimera and DNA bound to a three-box site had a free leucine zipper, it is possible that excess leucine zipper would bind to the complex and alter the mobility of the binding patterns. Titration of up to 100-fold molar excess of leucine zipper does not alter the mobility of the binding patterns (data not shown). This result does not support the idea of a free leucine zipper present in the complex; however, it cannot prove that interactions occur between the three leucine zippers of the trimer (i.e. that there is a three-stranded coiled coil), since it is formally possible that a free leucine zipper exists, but is not accessible. To further address the possibility of whether the trimeric complex is formed by binding of a dimer and a free protein subunit, we titrated free DNAbinding domain into the reaction. The DNA-binding domain alone binds to DNA at much higher protein concentrations than those used in this experiment (Flick et al., 1994), but it might be possible that cooperative interactions between a free DNA-binding domain and a DNA-bound one

The trimeric complex is observed only on the HSE that contains three GAA boxes in a continuous array, while the two-box site and the 2  1 site are bound by dimers and tetramers. In the second experiment, the orientation of the GAA boxes was tested by looking at the effect of inverting one of the GAA boxes on a three-box element. This creates a site in which the three GAA

68 effectively lower the concentration needed to get the second DNA-binding domain bound to DNA. Previous experiments had shown that at lower concentrations of leucine zipper chimera, such as those used in this experiment, formation of both dimers and trimers occurs. If addition of the third monomer did not require a leucine zipper, then titration of excess DNA-binding domain might promote the formation of trimeric complexes. As shown in Figure 8(c), titration of up to 50-fold higher concentrations of DNA-binding domain did not in¯uence the ratio of trimers to dimers. Taken together, the results of these two experiments suggest that it is unlikely that the trimeric complex formed on a three-box site consists of a dimer plus a third free subunit and most likely that the trimeric complex consists of a direct association between the three leucine zipper domains. There are many possible models that can explain the data, including non-speci®c interactions between different parts of the chimera or fast exchange of leucine zipper dimeric partners, that are dif®cult to exclude experimentally. Nevertheless, we support the idea that the chimeric protein forms a three-stranded coiled coil on a three-box site, and we suggest that this is possible because the pseudo 3-fold symmetry of the DNA structure (Figure 1) would promote the formation of the three-stranded coiled coil. Effect of a single point mutation in the leucine zipper The possibility that the leucine zipper chimera forms a three-stranded coiled coil on a three-box site is strengthened by analysis of a mutant form

of the leucine zipper. Studies on the leucine zipper have identi®ed different components that determine the oligomeric state (Hu et al., 1990, 1993; Harbury et al., 1993, 1994; Betz et al., 1995). For example, changing the buried asparagine residue at position 16 of the GCN4 leucine zipper sequence to glutamine enabled the peptide, which normally forms only two-stranded coiled coils, to form both

69 gel mobility shift assay and con®rmed by direct stoichiometric analysis of the complexes in the gel. The ability of the HSF-leucine zipper chimera to bind as a trimer depended on the binding site having three contiguous and inverted repeats (Figure 7). This suggested two possible models for formation of a trimer, shown in Figure 8(a) and (b). In the ®rst model, the leucine zippers form a three-stranded coiled coil in order to stabilize trimer formation. In the second, a dimeric chimera binds and attracts a monomeric chimera protein to bind via cooperative interactions between adjacent DNA-binding domains. Two experiments contradict the model in Figure 8(b). First, titration of excess leucine zipper does not alter the mobility of the complexes, suggesting that it is not able to bind to any free and accessible leucine zippers in the DNA-bound complex. Second, titration of excess DNA-binding domain does not increase the amount of trimer formation at low concentrations of the HSF-leucine zipper chimera, suggesting that trimer formation needs more than cooperative interactions between adjacent DNA-binding domains. The results of these experiments lend support indirectly to the triple-stranded coiled coil model in Figure 8(a). Further support is seen with a mutant leucine zipper, which promotes trimerization in solution and increases the af®nity of the HSF-chimera for a three-box site. One usual aspect of HSF binding to DNA is its ability to bind both permutations of a twobox palindromic sequence, nGAAnnTTCn or nTTCnnGAAn, with almost equal af®nity (Perisic et al., 1989; Xiao et al., 1991). This indicates that there is a great deal of ¯exibility in the orientation of HSF subunits relative to each other when bound to DNA. We have shown that this ¯exibility is not a result of HSF's trimeric symmetry, since the HSFGCN4 chimeric protein D(21L)Z, which binds these sites as a dimer, exhibits the same behavior. We can compare HSF's ability to recognize different arrangements of binding sites with the ¯exibility of binding displayed by the nuclear hormone receptor family of DNA-binding proteins (for reviews, see Desvergne, 1994; Gronemeyer & Moras, 1995; Luisi & Freedman, 1995). Receptor homodimers bind to palindromic sites of inverted repeats (Luisi et al., 1991); however, many members of this family also form heterodimers that bind sites of direct repeats (Mader et al., 1993; Perlmann et al., 1993; Rastinejad et al., 1995). A ¯exible connection between the domains is thought to allow binding to both types of sites. Similarly, the ability of HSF to recognize and bind two different arrangements of a palindromic sequence is probably related to the ¯exibility of the conserved linker sequence (Flick et al., 1994) that connects the oligomerization and DNA-binding domains in the wild-type and chimeric proteins. The basic effect of trimerization on HSF's DNAbinding properties is to increase the protein's af®nity for a three-box HSE so that it greatly prefers this site over two-box palindromic sites. It has

two-stranded and three-stranded coiled coils in solution (Gonzalez et al., 1996b). We made the same change in the leucine zipper sequence of our HSF-GCN4 chimeric protein. This construct, with an asparagine to glutamine substitution, is referred to as D(21L)ZQ. EGS cross-linking shows that D(21L)ZQ forms both dimers and trimers (Figure 9(a)). Analytical ultracentrifugation of D(21L)ZQ gives an average molecular mass of 39.1(Æ2.6) kDa, which is intermediate between the predicted molecular mass for dimers (31.6 kDa) and trimers (47.4 kDa). This suggests that D(21L)ZQ can form a mixture of dimers and trimers in solution, in agreement with the results on the isolated leucine zipper mutant (Gonzalez et al., 1996b). The complexes formed by D(21L)ZQ upon binding to two-box and three-box HSEs are shown in Figure 9(c). When D(21L)ZQ is bound to a two-box HSE, it forms both dimers and trimers, as expected from the results in solution, while on a three-box site, it forms exclusively trimers. D(21L)ZQ binds all arrangements of a two-box site with an apparent Kd of approximately 40 nM, but binds the three-box site with an apparent Kd of approximately 2 nM (data not shown). This con®rms the premise that the ability to trimerize in solution greatly increases the af®nity of HSF or an HSF chimera for a three-box site. In summary, these results suggest that the asparagine to glutamine substitution, while promoting formation of a threestranded coiled coil, also promotes trimerization on DNA. This lends support to the idea that, on a three-box HSE, the leucine zipper portion of the chimera monomers, even in the case of the D(21L)Z with a wild-type leucine zipper, are positioned in such a way as to promote the formation of a three-stranded coiled coil.

Discussion
Substitution of the HSF trimerization domain with a leucine zipper in the minimal HSF required for function in vivo results in a functional HSF. In order to further study this, we compared the oligomeric behavior of an HSF-leucine zipper chimera to the analogous HSF truncation. Both proteins contained the DNA-binding domain and linker region from S. cerevisiae HSF and differed only in their oligomerization domains. In solution, the HSF truncation is trimeric, while the HSF-leucine zipper chimera is either monomeric or dimeric depending on the protein concentration. We had previously shown that the HSF truncation binds to all HSEs as a trimer, and forms multimers of trimers at higher protein concentrations (Rye et al., 1993). The HSF-leucine zipper chimera, however, has different oligomerization properties depending on the binding site. On a two-box site, the HSF-leucine zipper chimera bound as a dimer; on a threebox site, it bound as a trimer. The results were initially observed by differences in mobility in a

70 been noted that the minimal 5 bp site bound by an HSF monomer is small and provides few speci®c DNA contacts (Kroeger et al., 1993; Kim et al., 1994). Zinc ®nger motifs also recognize and bind three base-pair sequences (Nardelli et al., 1991, 1992; Pavletich & Pabo, 1991); in their case, the problem of binding speci®city is typically solved by using multiple, covalently linked ®ngers to contact several triplet sites (Pavletich & Pabo, 1991, 1993; Clemens et al., 1994). In the case of HSF, an HSE containing two GAA repeats may not provide enough speci®c DNA contacts for high-af®nity binding. The addition of a third DNA-binding subunit and the resulting preference for a three-repeat site (or, conversely, the addition of a third set of speci®c DNA contacts and the resulting preference for binding a trimer) may have arisen to meet a need for a more speci®c and stable binding interaction for HSF in the regulation of the heat shock response (Giardina & Lis, 1995). One still must explain why the leucine zipper can functionally replace the trimerization domain despite the lowered DNA-binding af®nity. We would suggest that the yeast can survive at physiological temperatures with a lower level of HSF activity. This has been noted from other studies as well; for example, deletion of the trimerization domain reduces binding at least 20-fold in vitro, yet the yeast can still survive (Sorger & Nelson, 1989; Sorger, 1990). It is striking that the oligomeric properties of the chimeric protein's leucine zipper are in¯uenced by DNA. Studies on the switch between two, three, and four-stranded coiled coils of the GCN4 leucine zipper suggest that the number of strands formed depends not only on the pattern of hydrophobic and polar amino acids, but also on the shapes of the buried side-chains (Harbury et al., 1993, 1994; Betz et al., 1995; Gonzalez et al., 1996b). In addition, small ligands can alter the oligomeric state (Gonzalez et al., 1996a). Our studies suggest that other factors, such as the proximity of the strands due to placement on DNA, can also in¯uence the oligomeric state of the coiled coils. This lends a cautionary note to other studies on DNA-binding proteins that use the leucine zipper as a replacement for their oligomerization domains.

DNA-Dependent Oligomerization States which has an NdeI site at amino acid residue 333; pHN533, which has a double stop codon after amino acid residue 424 followed by an NheI site; and pHN413, which is deleted for amino acid residues 281 to 332, inclusive. Two derivatives were made of pHN413: pHN534, which has an NdeI site at amino acid residue 333; and pHN537, which has a double stop codon after amino acid residue 424 followed by an NheI site. An NdeI-NheI fragment from pHN530 was ligated into the NdeI-NheI backbone of pHN111, creating pHN531, and into the NdeI-NheI backbone of pHN534, creating pHN535. In both cases, the NdeI site was removed and wild-type amino acid sequence restored on both sides of the fusion by oligo-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, creating pHN532 and pHN536, respectively. Fragments from a BamHI-NheI digest of pHN532, pHN533, pHN536, and pHN537 were cloned into a BamHI-NheI backbone of pHN1002 (Hubl et al., 1994), creating plasmids pHN1507 (encoding ND(73L)Z, which contains amino acid residues 1 to 332 of HSF and the leucine zipper of GCN4), pHN1509 (encoding ND(73L)T, which contains amino acid residues 1 to 424 of HSF), pHN1511 (encoding ND(21L)Z, which contains amino acid residues 1 to 280 of HSF and the leucine zipper of GCN4), and pHN1513 (encoding ND(21L)T, which contains amino acid residues 1 to 280 and 333 to 424 of HSF), respectively. pHN1002 is a CEN/ARS/TRP4 yeast shuttle vector carrying a full-length copy of the S. cerevisiae HSF gene including its own promoter. The new constructs (pHN1507, pHN1509, pHN1511, and pHN1513) express truncated versions of HSF and HSF chimeras in yeast. Oligo-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (Sambrook et al., 1989) was used to put an EcoRI site into pHN502 at the beginning of the sequence encoding the GCN4 leucine zipper, creating pHN504. Oligo-mediated sitedirected mutagenesis was used to put an EcoRI site into pHN148 (Flick et al., 1994) immediately after amino acid residue 280 of the S. cerevisiae HSF gene, creating pHN514. An NdeI-EcoRI fragment from pHN514 was cloned into the NdeI-EcoRI cut backbone of pHN504 to make pHN515, which encodes amino acid residues 170 to 280 of S. cerevisiae HSF attached to the GCN4 leucine zipper. The EcoRI site was removed and wild-type amino acid sequence restored on both sides of the fusion by oligo-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, creating pHN516. An NdeI-BamHI fragment from pHN516 was cloned into a variant of the pET3b expression vector to create pHN517. pHN517 expresses the protein D(21L)Z, which contains the S. cerevisiae DNA-binding domain (amino acid residues 170 to 259, and the conserved linker (amino acid residues 260 to 280), as well as the GCN4 leucine zipper. Oligo-mediated site-directed mutagenesis was used to change the asparagine residue at position 15 of the leucine zipper sequence of pHN516 to glutamine, creating pHN526, and the lysine residue at position 27 of the leucine zipper sequence of pHN516 to cysteine, creating pHN528. NdeI-BamHI fragments from pHN526 and pHN528 were cloned into a variant of the pET3b expression vector to create pHN527 and pHN529, respectively. pHN527 expresses the protein D(21L)ZQ, and pHN529 expresses the protein D(21L)ZSH. The construction of pHN150, the expression vector of D(21L)T, has been described (Flick et al., 1994). Figure 2 illustrates all of the protein fragments used in both yeast and E. coli expression.

Yeast and E. coli protein expression vectors Plasmid pFG60 was a generous gift from Dr Jim Hu. A XbaI-BamHI fragment from pFG60 that contained the sequence of a fos-GCN4 chimera was cloned into pBluescriptKS to create pHN500. The existing EcoRI site was abolished by restriction digest followed by ®lling in with Klenow polymerase and blunt end ligation; this created plasmid pHN502. An NdeI site was put at the start of the leucine zipper, and a stop codon and then an NheI site was put at the end of the leucine zipper, creating plasmid pHN530. pHF157 is a pBluescriptKS plasmid that encodes S. cerevisiae HSF amino acid residues 1 to 537 (Sorger & Nelson, 1989). Three derivatives were made: pHN111,

DNA-Dependent Oligomerization States Yeast growth assay The yeast tester strain (a gift from P. Sorger) is a haploid derivative of S. cerevisiae W303 (MATa ade2-1 trp1 can1-100 leu2,3-112 his3-11,15 ura3; Shore & Nasmyth, 1987), which carried the HSFÁ2::LEU2 chromosomal disruption and a wild-type HSF gene under the control of a GAL1 promoter on a derivative of the URA3-containing plasmid YCp50 (Sorger & Pelham, 1988). Plasmids containing a mutant version of HSF were transformed into the yeast tester strain using the PEG-lithium acetate procedure (Elble, 1992). The transformants were plated onto the appropriate selective synthetic medium with 2% (w/ v) galactose. Colonies were grown and plated in rich medium with 2% (w/v) dextrose, and then tested for the loss of the URA-3 containing plasmids on the appropriate selective synthetic medium with 2% (w/v) glucose. The yeast were then restreaked onto plates and grown at 30 C and 37 C for comparison. Protein overexpression and purification The pET3b expression vectors were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS. Protein expression was induced as described (Studier et al., 1989; Rye et al., 1993). Cells were suspended in 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and stored at À20 C. D(21L)T was puri®ed as described (Flick et al., 1994). D(21L)Z and D(21L)ZQ were puri®ed as follows. Frozen cells were thawed and 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin were added. The cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 39,000 g for 20 minutes at 10 C. The high-speed supernatant was diluted to 50 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris (pH 6.7), 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and loaded onto a heparin-agarose column (Sigma). The column was developed with a NaCl gradient and the protein eluted at 650 mM. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted to 50 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris (pH 6.7), 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, prior to loading onto a carboxymethyl-Sepharose column (Pharmacia). The column was developed with a NaCl gradient and the protein eluted at 450 mM. Peak fractions from this column were pooled and diluted to 100 mM NaCl in 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and loaded onto a second heparin-agarose column, which was also developed with a NaCl gradient. The protein eluted at 650 mM NaCl. Peak fractions typically contained 0.5 to 1 mg/ml protein of approximately 95% purity as judged from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. These were stored in aliquots at À70 C. Puri®cation of D(21L)ZSH was conducted as described above for D(21L)Z with the following modi®cations. After sonication of the E. coli expression culture, DTT was added to the lysed cells to a concentration of 10 mM. The cell extract was diluted with 50 mM Tris (pH 6.7), 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mM sodium tetrathionate before loading onto the ®rst heparin column. After elution from the carboxymethyl-Sepharose, peak fractions were combined and diluted with sodium phosphate (pH 8.5), 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v) to lower the NaCl concentration to 100 mM. The second heparin column was run with a NaCl gradient in the same sodium phosphate (pH 8.5) buffer. In addition, 2 mM sodium tetrathionate was added to all buffers except to the phosphate buffers used with the second heparin column. D(21L) was a generous gift from K. Flick; the protein was puri®ed from expression vector pHN420 as

71
described (Flick et al., 1994). The leucine zipper peptide was a generous gift from L. Gonzalez. Cross-linking reactions Samples of puri®ed protein were diluted to a ®nal concentration of 5 mM in a buffer of 100 mM triethanolamine (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol. EGS was added from a freshly made 200 mM stock in dimethylsulfoxide to ®nal concentrations of 0.5 to 50 mM. The reactions were incubated for ®ve minutes at room temperature and quenched by the addition of lysine to a ®nal concentration of 20 mM. After cross-linking, 10 ml of 4 Â SDS loading buffer was added to the reactions for SDS-PAGE. Ultracentrifugation Sedimentation equilibria were determined with a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge run at a speed of 60,000 rpm with a radius of 5.8 to 7.2 cm at a temperature of 25 C. Protein loading concentrations were 2 to 10 mM in 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 10 % (w/v) glycerol. The data were analyzed using programs supplied by Beckman assuming a two-component system (solvent and solute), ®tting a model curve to the observed distribution (Laue et al., 1992). Plasmids containing HSEs and preparation of DNA fragments Plasmids pBL2tt (aTTCtaGAAa), pBL3 (aGAAtaTTCtaGGAa), and pBL4tt (aTTCtaGAAtaTTCtaGAAa) were generated by cloning BamHI fragments of the plasmids pI2, pI3, and pI4 (Perisic et al., 1989) containing the HSF binding sites into pBluescriptKS  . Oligo-mediated sitedirected mutagenesis was used to make the following changes in the binding sites: the third GAA box of the pBL3 binding site was abolished to create pBL2hh (with the sequence aGAAtaTTCt), the second GAA box of pBL3 was abolished to create pBL2sk (aGAAtaaggtaGAAa), and the third GAA box of the pBL4tt binding site was abolished to create pBL(2  1) (aTTCtaGAAtaaggtaGAAa). PCR mutagenesis was used to change the pI3 recognition site from aGAAtaTTCtaGAAa to: aGAAtaTTCtaGAAt to create pBL3v1; aGAAtaTTCtaTTCt to create pBL3v2; and aTTCtaTTCtaGAAt to create pBL3v3. Fragments created by SpeI-XhoI digests, which contained the HSF binding sites, were labeled at both ends with Klenow polymerase and [a-32P]dTTP and [a-32P]dCTP for use in radiolabeled gel shift assays. For convenience in viewing the Figures, the fragments are labeled with HSE- replacing the pBL portion of their name. Binding reactions and gel shift assays Binding of protein to DNA was performed in 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 10 % glycerol, 500 mg/ ml bovine serum albumin. For typical binding reactions, a target DNA fragment (0.2 to 2 fmol) was mixed with a sample of the protein (0.02 fmol to 20 pmol) and incubated at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. Mixing was typically conducted in a total ®nal volume of 20 ml. Reactions containing non-speci®c competitor DNA, as noted in the Figure legends, included 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) or 0.02 mg/ml calf thymus DNA. Reactions containing D(21L), which has a C-terminal cysteine resi-

72
due, were incubated in the presence of 5 mM DTT. After incubation, the samples were loaded onto 0.25 Â TBE (23 mM Tris-borate (pH 8.3), 0.5 mM EDTA) polyacrylamide gels (1 mm thick gels with 0.5 cm wide wells). Electrophoresis was conducted in 0.25 Â TBE buffer at 20 V/cm for 90 to 105 minutes at room temperature. Two-color fluorescent gel shift assays Fluorescein-5-maleimide was obtained from Molecular Probes. Modi®cation of D(21L)ZSH with ¯uorescein-5maleimide was performed as described for a previous HSF construct (Rye et al., 1993). Binding reactions were performed as described (Rye et al., 1993) using 500 bp PvuII fragments from plasmids pBL2tt and pBL3 labeled with TOTIN5 (Benson et al., 1995) at a DNA: to dye molar ratio of 40 bp/dye molecule. Electrophoresis, gel scanning, and image processing were done as described (Rye et al., 1993). Quantification of dye-labeled DNA in complexes Quanti®cation was done as described for a previous HSF construct (Rye et al., 1993). Brie¯y, for each gel, the molar amount of DNA was measured by comparing the signal in the 645 to 700 nm channel to that from the known amounts of DNA in a fX174 HaeIII digest loaded onto the same gel with our binding reactions. The resulting curve is the ratio of signal per gram of labeled DNA. The molar amount of DNA fragment in each HSF-DNA complex on the gel was calculated by using this calibration curve to determine the gram amount of DNA in the band and then dividing this number by the molecular mass of the DNA fragment. Quantification of fluorescein-labeled HSF in complexes Amounts (0.2 ng, 0.5 ng, 1 ng, and 2 ng) of ¯uorescein-labeled D(21L)ZS-Fl were mixed with increasing amounts of a DNA fragment containing an HSE of four GAA boxes in a ®nal reaction volume of 24 ml. These reactions were loaded into a microtiter tray and scanned at 532 nm with the confocal scanning system. There was no signi®cant change in protein ¯uorescence due to added DNA. We plotted the average ¯uorescein signal versus moles of protein to obtain a calibration curve of the signal per mole of D(21L)ZS-Fl. The molar amount of D(21L)ZS-Fl in each complex was determined by comparing the signal in the 500 to 565 nm channel to the calibration curve. Quantification of DNA signal and estimation of DNA-binding affinity Dried gels were used to expose Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager plates, which were then scanned on the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The signal volumes of all bands present in a given lane of a gel, including the free DNA, were quanti®ed using MD ImageQuant. To estimate DNA-binding af®nity, the average percentage of the total signal in each lane found in protein-DNA complexes was plotted against protein concentration. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of the binding reaction is equal to the concentration at which half of the DNA is bound by protein. Because of the strong cooperativity, which results in multiple complexes

DNA-Dependent Oligomerization States bound to a single HSE, true dissociation constants could not be measured.
