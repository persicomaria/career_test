Acceleration of 5-Methylcytosine Deamination in Cyclobutane Dimers by G and Its Implications for UV-Induced C-to-T Mutation Hotspots
Vincent J. Cannistraro and John-Stephen Taylor
Department of Chemistry, Washington University, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA Received 13 February 2009; received in revised form 15 July 2009; accepted 16 July 2009 Available online 22 July 2009 Sunlight-induced CT mutation hotspots occur most frequently at methylated CpG sites in tumor suppressor genes and are thought to arise from translesion synthesis past deaminated cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). While it is known that methylation enhances CPD formation in sunlight, little is known about the effect of methylation and sequence context on the deamination of 5-methylcytosine (mC) and its contribution to mutagenesis at these hotspots. Using an enzymatic method, we have determined the yields and deamination rates of C and mC in CPDs and find that the frequency of UVB-induced CPDs correlates with the oxidation potential of the flanking bases. We also found that the deamination of TmC and mCT CPDs is about 25-fold faster when flanked by G's than by A's, C's or T's in duplex DNA and appears to involve catalysis by the O6 group of guanine. In contrast, the first deamination of either C or mC in ACmCG with a flanking G was much slower (t1/2 N 250 h) and rate limiting, while the second deamination was much faster. The observation that CmCG dimers deaminate very slowly but at the same time correlate with CT mutation hotspots suggests that their repair must be slow enough to allow sufficient time for deamination. There are, however, a greater number of single CT mutations than CCTT mutations at CmCG sites even though the second deamination is very fast, which could reflect faster repair of doubly deaminated dimers.

Introduction
In basal and squamous cell carcinomas, the p53 tumor suppressor gene exhibits a high percentage of C-to-T transition mutations at dipyrimidine sites.1­5 Previous studies on sunlight-induced mouse skin tumors indicate that 30­50% of these mutations are due to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photoproducts (Fig. 1a).6,7 A comparison of sunlight-induced mutation spectra of cII and

lacI transgenes as well as that of the p53 gene in human skin tumors reveal that 5-methylcytosine (mC) is involved in 25­40% of the mutations in all three systems.8 Most significantly, methylation at the C of PyCG increases CPD formation in sunlight 15-fold.9 The principal polymerase involved in synthesizing past CPDs is polymerase  (pol ). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have found, however, that T-, U-, C-, and m C-containing CPDs are not measurably mutagenic when replicated by pol .10­14 Indeed, loss of functional pol  in xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) results in an increased risk of skin cancer due to the replication of photodimers by more errorprone polymerases.15­17 While C and mC are very stable with a deamination half-life of 30,000 years in duplex DNA,18 C and mC within CPDs are more than a millionfold less stable and deaminate to U or T, respectively (Fig. 1a), in hours to days due to loss of aromatic stabilization.14,19­27 The replication

(bypass) of these deaminated products by a pol Y family polymerase is thought to be the origin of most UV-induced C-to-T mutations, a process otherwise known as the deamination-bypass mechanism (Fig. 1b).24­26,28­31 Little is known, however, about the deamination of C and mC within PymCG mutational hotspots. Deamination of C and mC in CPDs has been studied in dinucleotides and in single-stranded DNA by chromatographic, mass spectrometry, and enzymatic analysis.14,19,20,22,23,27 Deamination has also been studied in vivo by genetic assays and by ligation-mediated PCR.21,24­26 The reported deamination rates vary from hours to weeks depending on the substrate and organism with no clear explanation for the differences. In this article, we describe a sensitive method for determining in vitro deamination rates of C- and mC-containing cyclobutane

dimers in duplex DNA using site-specifically radiolabeled nucleotides. While methylation only occurs at CG sites in vertebrates, such sequence restrictions do not apply in plants and fungi32 where mCcontaining dimers could be formed in any sequence context. We therefore determined the deamination rates of both NmCfmCN pyrimidine dimers, where N is any base to better understand the structure­ activity relationships in deamination of mC and its biological implications. We found that deamination of TfmC or mCfT cyclobutane dimers is at least 10fold faster when flanked by G relative to A, C, or T and appears to involve the O6 carbonyl group of guanine. In contrast, deamination of C or mC in CfmCG, a known hotspot for C-to-T mutations in humans, is very slow and suggests the rate of repair of these dimers must also be slow to allow sufficient time for deamination.

1147 pH 8.3 to minimize deamination.14 Under these conditions, cis-syn dimers, (6-4) photoproducts, and their Dewar isomers are the major products, whereas trans-syn and TA photoproducts are minor products. After irradiation, the samples were adjusted to pH 7 and allowed to deaminate at 37 °C for specific times, and then the cis-syn dimers were specifically photoreverted with 100-fold excess of E. coli photolyase.33 After photoreversion, the DNA was degraded to 5-mononucleotide phosphates with nuclease P1 to generate 32pmC/C and 32pT/U, which were separated by a two-dimensional (2D) acrylamide gel system (Fig. 3a). All nonphotorevertible dipyrimidine photoproducts are digested to trinucleotides, pPyPyN.34 Nuclease P1 interfered with migration of the nucleotides in a citrate gel and could not be used to separate 32pmC/C and 32pT/U directly in a single dimension. We therefore ran a 10% acrylamide gel containing TBE [Tris-borate EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)] and 7 M urea to separate 32pmC/ C and 32pT/U as a single intense band as a firstdimension step (shown in rectangle). Because of the low percentage of acrylamide, this band also contained some incompletely digested di- and trinucleotide products as well as photoproductcontaining trinucleotides as discussed below. The second dimension with citrate buffer35 was used to separate 32pT/U from 32pmC/C, which appear as distinct and reproducible bands of high and low mobility, respectively. Oligonucleotides in a citrate gel move primarily according to base composition and are not very sensitive to size, with electrophoretic mobility increasing in the order C N A  G N T. A number of intermediate bands of variable amounts (b 5%) that were incompletely digested by nuclease P1 were also observed. These bands correspond to ODN dimers, trimers, and possibly higher oligomers, with variable base

Results and Discussion
Methodology To determine the rate of formation and deamination of C and mC in cis-syn cyclobutane dimers, we developed an assay that takes advantage of the specificity of Escherichia coli photolyase for reverting this class of photoproduct. The idea was to 32P-label the C or mC of interest and, after photodimerization and deamination, specifically degrade the cis-syn photodimer along with undamaged DNA to mononucleotides with E. coli photolyase and nuclease P1 (Fig. 2). The extent of deamination could then be quantified by analysis of the deaminated to undeaminated 32P-labeled nucleotide by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). To ensure that the substrate was in the duplex form and to minimize end effects on deamination, we designed a 42-mer containing two centrally located pyrimidines (Py's) (X and Y) flanked by variable bases of interest (N and M) (Table 1). The other bases in the immediate vicinity (n) were chosen to minimize unwanted secondarystructure formation in the single strand that might result from the choice of N, X, Y, and M. To prepare the internally labeled 42-mer, an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) containing a 5-terminal mC was [-32P]-end-labeled and then ligated to a second ODN using a 20-mer scaffold. The ligated product was then separated from the ligation scaffold by denaturing gel electrophoresis in the presence of a sixfold excess of an ODN that was complementary to the scaffold to ensure that only the singlestranded form of the 42-mer was obtained. The duplex form was then prepared by annealing the 32 P-labeled 42-mer to the complementary 42-mer. Irradiation of single-stranded or duplex 42-mer was performed at 302 nm (UV-B light) for 1 h at 4 °C and

(a) 2D acrylamide gel of the nuclease P1 digestion products of duplex tGTfmCGtc that was deaminated for 0, 59, 120, 171, 218, 330, 456, and 536 min at 37 °C (lanes 1­8, respectively) in 10 mM Tris/ Mes/HCl (pH 7.0) containing approximately 5 mM NaCl, and then photoreverted. Lane 9 contains the products following 16-h incubation at 67 °C at pH 6.3. The first dimension was carried out in the downward direction in 10% acrylamide with a 7 M urea, TBE buffer to give an unresolved mixture of the 32P-labeled mononucleotides pmdC and pT that migrate as a single intense band shown in the box. The second dimension was carried out in the upward direction toward the positive electrode in 28% acrylamide/citrate. The second dimension separates pT (fastest migrating band) from pmdC (slowest migrating band). The bands in the middle (b5%) are due to incomplete digestion products of P1 nuclease and nonphotorevertible-photoproduct-containing trinucleotides. (b) Plots of the fraction of undeaminated dimer versus time: data for duplex tGTfCGtc in 0 mM added NaCl () shown in (a), and in 400 mM added NaCl () and data for duplex tATmCAtc in 0 mM () and 400 mM (O) added NaCl.

the cis-syn dimer-containing trinucleotide photoproducts also migrated with these bands but are completely eliminated by photoreversal conditions used in our experiment. Further experiments with T4 endo V to quantify cis-syn dimers in 5-endlabeled substrate also showed that under the conditions used, photolyase reverted N95% of TT and TmC cis-syn dimers. The incompletely digested products and nonrevertible photoproducts do not interfere with quantification of the pT/U band, as very little product was observed at the position of this band at zero deamination time, and any background activity at this time point was subtracted from the other lanes. To determine the rate of deamination, the yield of cis-syn photodimer was first determined by heating the irradiated DNA to 67 °C at pH 6.3 for 16 h to completely deaminate the dimer prior to the photolyase and nuclease P1 steps, and then calculating the ratio of the pT/U band to the pmC/C + pT/U band. The half-lives were obtained from a plot of the natural log of the fraction of undeaminated dimer versus time. Figure 3b shows typical plots of the data from different 2D gels from which the half-lives were calculated. Deamination of in mCfT

composition. Control experiments with unirradiated DNA suggested that the incompletely digested products may have arisen from a small fraction of labeled substrate that was in poor contact with NP1 and, because each time point was digested separately, are of variable amounts. Because NP1 cannot discriminate between undamaged DNA and photoreverted DNA, the calculation of the percentage of deaminated product is not affected by the presence of partially digested products as long as the photoreversion of the CPDs is complete. Another contributor to the intermediate bands are trimers resulting from digestion of nonphotorevertible DNA photoproducts. Experiments with and without photoreversal by photolyase showed that

In our first experiments, we compared deamination rates of mC within mCfT and TfmC dimers flanked either by A's or by G's. Comparing the same flanking base, the 3- m C in the dimer deaminates about three to four times faster than the 5-mC in both single-stranded and duplex DNA. (Table 1, Fig. 4). This contrasts with the deamination of C in the cis-syn dimers of the dinucleotides TpdC and dCpT, which have similar half-lives of 1.3 and 1.2 h, respectively, at pH 7 at 50 °C.22 Together, these results initially suggested that the slower deamination of the 5-mC is due to steric interference by the 5-flanking base, which might impede the attack of water or hydroxide on C4 of a 5-C (Fig. 1c). In the crystal structure of a cis-syn thymine dimer flanked by A's (Fig. 5a and b),36 the 3-flanking base is moved greatly to the side and would not pose the same degree of steric interference to the attack of water or hydroxide on C4 of a 3-mC. Single-stranded DNA is also partially stacked and might confer a similar degree of steric interference. On the other hand, mC appears to deaminate almost 200 times faster in the dimer of the dinucleotide TpdmC (5.6 h, pH 7.4, 50 °C)27 than in the dimer of dmCpT (48 days or 1152 h, pH 7, 25 °C).23 Barring some experimental error, this large difference in rate suggests that the methyl group interferes more with the approach of hydroxide from the 5-side than the approach from the 3side due to the cyclobutane ring conformation, which must be different in the dinucleotide compared with single-stranded or duplex DNA. In support of this idea, the cyclobutane ring conformation of a TT dimer has been shown to be

significantly different in duplex DNA compared with the dinucleotide.38 Deamination of m CfT and Tfm C is fastest when the mC is flanked by G The deamination half-lives of mC in a CPD flanked by either A or G are very similar in singlestranded DNA, with values of 3.5 and 4.2 h for GTfmCG and ATfmCA, respectively, and 10.7 and 12.1 h for GmCfTG and AmCfTA, respectively

Sequences in bold and blue on the front face of the cube refer to the double-stranded form. Numbers in italics are the deamination half-lives in hours.

(Table 1 and Fig. 4). In contrast, deamination of mC in duplex DNA was fastest when flanked by G's. The t1/2 for mC was 22 times shorter for GTfmCG (5.8 h) than for ATfmCA (134 h) and approached that observed in single-stranded DNA. Likewise, the t1/2 for deamination in GmCfTG (26.6 h) was 19 times shorter than that for AmCfTA (N 500 h). To determine the effect of a flanking C or T on deamination, we determined the deamination rates of mC within TTmCTT and CCmCCC sequences in duplex DNA. Irradiation of these sequences produces a mixture of two dipyrimidine dimers with the m C located either in the 5- or in the 3-positions. Using the cis-syn-dimer-specific T4 endonuclease V, we found that TTfmCT and TmCfTT were produced in a 2:1 ratio and that CCfmCC and CmCfCC were produced in a 3:4 ratio. The observed deamination rate is therefore a composite of the rates of deamination for mC in the 5- and 3-positions, which could differ by fourfold based on what was observed for the deamination of mC flanked by A or G. The observed deamination half-life of 300 h for mC in dimers flanked by C's is about two to three times longer than the 107­160 h determined for deamination of the two central C's in CCCC of plasmid DNA in vitro,25 as would be expected from the rateretarding effect of methylation. The deamination half-life is also similar to the 160 h calculated from the percent deamination data for CCC in codon 300 of the p53 gene in irradiated human cells.26 In that same study, the deamination half-life of six TCT sites in the p53 gene was also about 160 h, comparable to the halflife of 385 h that we found for mC in a dimer flanked by T's. These deamination rates are very different, however, from the 3.9 h reported for a C in the TCT sequence tRNA suppressor gene in E. coli.21,39 This site in E. coli is actively transcribed, which would make the site more single-stranded and, consequently, more

photodimer with various analogs lacking specific functional groups of G (Fig. 6). When G was replaced by 2-aminopurine (aP), which lacks the C6 carbonyl group but retains the C2 amino group, the deamination rate of mC in TfmC slowed by 8-fold. When G was replaced with inosine, which lacks the C2 amino group but retains the carbonyl group, the rate only slowed 2-fold. Based on these results, we conclude that O6 and possibly N7 of guanine are somehow involved in directing or activating water for attack at C4. Consecutive guanines, as in GTfmCGGG, did not enhance the effect (Table 1), suggesting there is no cooperative effect between adjacent guanines. The O6 carbonyl group of G together with N7 may form a region of high negative electrostatic potential40 that stabilizes the positively charged protonated C effectively, raising the pKa to accelerate the reaction. This explanation is similar to the one used to explain why the cis-syn dimer of TpdC deaminates more quickly than the trans-syn-I dimer.22 In that case, it was found that the pKa of the protonated C in the trans-syn dimer was lower (2.9 versus 4.2) and attributed to a favorable alignment of the C4 carbonyl of T with the iminium ion of C located on the same side of the cyclobutane ring. In the trans-syn-I dimer, the O4 carbonyl of the T is on the opposite side of the cyclobutane ring and cannot interact as effectively. While the difference in rate is substantial at pH 4 (24-fold), it is much less at pH 7 (3-fold) than the 22-fold difference observed for deamination of mC flanked by G compared to A, C, or T. G may be able to achieve better alignment of its O4 carbonyl group (Fig. 5) compared with the O4 carbonyl of a flanking T, while A and C possess an amino group with a less favorable dipole. Effect of salt on deamination We tested the effect of salt on deamination, since mono- and divalent cations are known to interact

prone to deamination. Since the deamination halflives were very long for dimers flanked by T and C in our substrates and similar to those dimers flanked by A's, we conclude that G is unique in its ability to accelerate the deamination of C. Only the G immediately flanking a mC had this effect, with ATfmCG deaminating much more rapidly than GTfmCA (t1/2 of 6.6 and 170 h, respectively) (Table 1). O6 of guanine implicated in the deamination mechanism Spontaneous deamination of C or mC within a dinucleotide photoproduct is a general acidcatalyzed reaction.22 The reaction is initiated by the protonation of cytosine at N3, which induces a positive charge at C4. Attack of hydroxide or water on C4 then produces a tetrahedral hemi-aminal intermediate that collapses to release ammonia or ammonium ion (Fig. 1c). To determine whether a particular functional group on G might be involved in the mechanism, we replaced the G's flanking the

1151 69 h)27 indicates that methylation of a 3-C slows deamination by 9-fold. The effect appears to be even greater (172-fold) for 5-C compared with the deamination rates of dCpT (6.7 h) and dmCpT (48 days). A possible explanation may involve the cyclobutane ring conformation as discussed above (see the section Deamination of mC is faster in TfmC than in mCfT). Our results with duplex DNA are more in accord with an in vitro PCR experiment with irradiated plasmid DNA that indicates little effect of methylation on deamination of CmCG at codon 248 or 282.26 Double deamination of Cfm C to UfT Both C residues in a CfC cyclobutane dimer can individually deaminate to ultimately yield UfU and thereby result in a CCTT mutation after replication.25,26 To dissect the mechanism of the double deamination, we first tried to measure the deamination rates of C and mC in the sequence GCfmCG, but the yield of this product was very low (Table 2). We found that replacing the 5-G with A increased the yield, and that both the C and the mC deaminate very slowly and at nearly the same rates (t1/2 lives were 320 and 256 h respectively) (Table 2). The slow deamination of the mC flanked by G was surprising, since we had found that G greatly accelerates the deamination of TmC dimers. In ACfmCG, deamination of the C will lead to AUfmCG, whereas deamination of mC will lead to ACfTG, where the underlined bases are mispaired to G. Deamination of either C or mC was therefore expected to accelerate the deamination of the remaining base, since a basepair mismatch should enhance the accessibility of the C to protons and water through duplex destabilization. Indeed, we found that the deamination halflives of ACfTG and dAUfmCG with a G mismatch opposite the deaminated base were 28 and 4.7 h, respectively, and 11.4- and 54-fold faster than the corresponding sites in ACfmCG (Table 2). The U·G mismatch contributed very little to the 54-fold increase in the deamination rate of the 3-mC, as judged by only a 1.5-fold increase in the deamination

with both N7 and O6 of guanine by inner-sphereand water-mediated interactions41 and stabilize the duplex form.42 Deamination was carried out in 0­ 400 mM added NaCl with duplex GTfmCG and ATfmCA (Fig. S1). At the highest NaCl concentration, the deamination rate slowed by a factor of 3.8 for the G sequence and by a similar factor of 3.3 for the sequence flanked by A's. Surprisingly, the Gflanked sequence deaminated 20-fold faster than the A-flanked sequence over the entire range of salt concentrations. Consistent with the observation that both mono- and divalent cations compete for the same sites in DNA,43 we found that the rate of deamination of GTfmCG decreased by a factor of 4.3 in 10 mM MgCl2. From these results, it appears that salt may slow down deamination by stabilizing the duplex form of the helix in a non-sequencespecific manner, thereby inhibiting protonation of the C and addition of water. These results also indicate that while salt may not affect the relative rates of deamination between different sequences, deamination may be quite slow in vivo, where monovalent salt concentrations are about 150 mM. Effect of methylation on deamination of C Although it is known that C methylation greatly increases CPD formation in sunlight by about 15-fold,9 the effect of methylation on the deamination rate of photodimers in duplex DNA is not well established. We found that methylation of the C in GTfCG, ATfCG, and ATfCA slowed deamination by factors of 1.2, 1.3, and 3.8, respectively (Table 1). It appears that the deamination rate of a 3-C is more affected by methylation when flanked by an adjacent A than by a G. Deamination of a 5-C flanked by A was also slowed by a factor of 3.8 upon methylation [compare t1/2 of 500 h for AmCTA (Table 1) with 131 h for ACTG (Table 2)]. Comparing the estimated deamination rate for C in the cis-syn dimer TpdC at 25°C at pH 7 (half-life of 7.7 h)22 with that of methylated C at pH 7.4 (half-life of

1152 rate of mismatched AUfmCG compared to matched ATfmCG (Table 1). The T·G mismatch, however, appeared to be the major factor for the 11.4-fold increase in the rate of deamination of the 5-C, as judged from the 4.7-fold increase in rate of deamination of ACfTG compared to that of ACfTG. Thus, it would appear that the 5-C in ACfmCG exerts a much greater inhibitory effect on deamination of the 3-mC than does the 3-mC on the 5-C. The slow overall deamination rate of ACfmCG can thus be explained by a rate-limiting first deamination step that is of similar rate for both the 5-C and the 3-mC followed by a fast second deamination step. Our results are consistent with the in vitro rate of deamination of CC dimers in a CCCC sequence in a plasmid DNA by a reversion assay.25 A rate-limiting first deamination step with a half-life of 107­160 h was inferred, since single CT mutations plateaued at about 10%, while the frequency of CCTT mutations increased to about 90% over time. A two-step deamination mechanism with a rate-limiting first deamination also fits the observed reversion frequencies induced by a CC dimer in a CCC sequence in E. coli. 29 By fitting the mutation frequency to an analytical expression for two sequential first-order steps, we calculated the second deamination step to be 7.6 times faster than the first step. In contrast to the results of the in vitro deamination studies, the half-life for the first and second deamination steps were calculated to be 2.7 h and 21 min, respectively, which is indicative of some other process, such as transcription, that would disrupt the duplex nature of the DNA. The slower deamination of a CC dimer was first predicted by Lemaire and Ruzsicska from their studies of cis-syn and trans-syn-I TpdC dimers.22 As discussed above (see O6 of guanine implicated in the deamination mechanism), these workers found that the trans-syn-I dimer deaminates slower than the cis-syn dimer, which they attributed to a favorable dipole interaction between the O4 carbonyl of T with the iminium ion of the protonated C (Fig. 1c). On this basis, they argued that a cis-syn CC dimer should deaminate more slowly than a TC dimer because the amino group of the attached C would not have a favorable dipole interaction with the iminium ion of the protonated C. What is puzzling, however, is why m C in dimers of CCmCC that are flanked by C deaminates at approximately the same rate as the dimer in the ACmCG, which should be accelerated by the 3-flanking G (Table 1). Equally puzzling is why the mC in dimers of CCmCC, which should have an unfavorable dipole, deaminates at about the same rate as in dimers of TmCT. It may be that the complementary G-tract can slip and misalign with the dimer-containing C tract, which would disrupts the duplex structure and thereby accelerate deamination. It is also possible that a flanking C, unlike a C fixed in a particular position within the dimer, can help catalyze deamination by directing attack of hydroxide on the protonated C through H-bonding with its C4 amino group.

Sequence and methylation effects on photoproduct yield In preparing CPDs for deamination studies, we found that photoproduct yield at 302 nm was highly sensitive to flanking sequence (Table 1). We observed higher photoproduct yields when the dipyrimidines were flanked by A's compared with G's and that this was independent of the position of the mC in the dipyrimidine sequence. A 17% yield of CPD formation was observed for ATmCA compared to 5.4% for GTmCG, and a 7.8% yield of CPD formation for A m CTA compared to 3.4% for GmCTG. The yield was also high for an mC flanked by T's as judged by the combined yield of 15.7% for TfmC and mCfT CPDs in TTmCTT. The yield of CmC CPDs were lowest (1.4%) when the sequence was flanked by G's in GCmCG, intermediate (2.9%) when flanked by an A and a G, higher (3.4%) when flanked by A's in AC m CA, and highest (6% combined yield) when flanked by C's in CCmCCC. Methylation did not increase the photoproduct yields with 302-nm light as much as the 15-fold increase reported for simulated sunlight, only increasing the yield for GTfCG, ATfCA, ATfCG, and ACfTG by 5.4-, 2.4-, 2.4-, and 8-fold, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). Recent experiments have shown that a thymine dimer is produced in b 1 ps following UV excitation, which is faster than DNA can change conformation, suggesting that dimer yield is related to the proportion of photoreactive conformations.44 This proposal has been supported by molecular dynamics calculations correlating thymine dimer yield with conformation.45 Other factors can also enhance or diminish the yield of CPD formation by light, including photosensitization, and both direct and electron-transfer-mediated photoreversal of the dimer. Because of the many potential factors, it is hard to attribute the observed dimer yield to any single cause. Some factors, however, such as direct photoreversal, are not expected to contribute greatly at 302 nm due to the low absorptivity of Py dimers.22 Likewise, base-mediated photoinduced electron transfer is also inefficient at this wavelength, except for the special case of a quadruplex-bearing DNAzyme.46 As for photosensitization, A is at least 10-fold more efficient in excited-state energy transfer than C, G, or T at 256 nm.47 If photosensitization represents a dominant mechanism at 302 nm, the yield of CPDs should be lower with flanking T's compared with A's, which is not the case. Correlation of oxidation potential with photoproduct yield The observed yields are more consistent, however, with an electron-transfer-mediated mechanism as revealed by CPD formation in the sequence NTmCN where N = G, A, and inosine. When G is replaced by A, which has a higher oxidation potential, the yield increased from 5.4% to 17%. When the A's are replaced with inosine, which has an even a higher

oxidation potential,48 the yield further increased from 17% to 29%. We also found that consecutive G's, which have a lower oxidation potential than a single G,49 decreased photoproduct yield. Dimer formation in ggGTmCG and GTmCGgg was lower (3.9% and 3.4% yields, respectively) compared with that in GTmCG (5.4%). One possible explanation for these results is quenching of the Py excited state by electron transfer from the flanking base. This would result in the formation of an exciplex that could deactivate by back electron transfer. When the flanking G's in GTmCG are replaced with aminopurine (aP), which has an oxidation potential similar to that of A and therefore expected to increase the yield, the yield dropped from 5.4% to 2.8%. We attribute this drop in yield to competitive absorption of the 302-nm light by aP, which has a red-shifted absorption maximum at about 320 nm. In further support of an exciplex mechanism, we observe a lower photodimer yield when G is located in the 5-position relative to the dipyrimidine site. When the 5-A in the sequence ATmCA is replaced by G, the yield drops about 50%, from 17% to 8.8%, but if the 3-A is replaced by G, the yield only drops by about 30% to 12%. This is consistent with better stacking at Pu (purine)­Py sequences compared to Py­Pu sequences (Fig. 5c),37 which would facilitate electron transfer and exciplex formation. Interestingly, the effect of flanking A, C, G, and T on the yield of photoproduct induced at 302 nm parallels the yield observed at 254 nm, which has been explained by a competition between dimer formation and photoinduced electron-transfer-mediated reversion.50 Implications for the origin of sunlight-induced C-to-T mutations In our study, we found that a 3-flanking G has the unique ability to increase the deamination rate of mC in a TmC CPD, but not in a CmC CPD, which occurs about 50 times slower. If one accepts the deamination bypass mechanism as the principal pathway for C-to-T mutations, we would then expect that these

mutations would occur more frequently at TmC sites than at CmCG sites as has been observed in a SupF system.30 On the other hand, CmCG and not TmCG sites are the major mutation hotspots in the p53 gene of skin cancers. Of 86 CT mutations at eight methylated CCG and three TCG sites in non-XP squamous and basal skin cancers, 81 (97%) were at CmCG sites (Table 3).51 The lower than expected frequency of TCGTTG mutations can be explained, in part, by the very low frequency observed for this mutation at two of the these three TmCG sites in the p53 gene in all cancers, indicating that they are not as tumor promoting as those at the CmCG sites. The high frequency of CT mutations at CmCG in the p53 gene of skin cancers also suggests that dimers at these sites must be repaired slowly enough to allow deamination to occur prior to pol  replication. In support of this notion, it has been found that only 20% of dimers in Chinese hamster ovary cells were repaired in 6 h, and only 25­50% after 24 h.52 The initial rapid removal of 20% of the dimers is likely due to transcription-coupled repair, which has been shown to remove 70% of CPDs within 24 h.53 Transcription-coupled repair is known to preferentially remove dimers from the transcribed strand of the p53 gene, 54 which would explain why 71 of the 84 mutations at the eight CmCG sites are in the nontranscribed strand. It has also been found that 25­32% of cis-syn dimers at two CmCG sites in exon 8 of the mouse p53 gene remain after 48 h.7 Thus, it is likely that some fraction of dimers may persist for hundreds of hours in untranscribed regions as well as in untranscribed strands, giving them sufficient time to deaminate. Transcription, however, might also accelerate deamination in nontranscribed strands due to disruption of the duplex structure. While slow repair of CfmC dimers may explain the high frequency of CT mutations at CmCG sites, it does not explain the much higher percentage of single CT mutations than tandem CCTT mutations at these sites. Of 83 CT and CCTT mutations at the eight CmCG sites, 8 are CCTC

strand have enough time to completely deaminate and cause CCTT mutations. Our scheme also would predict that CCCT mutations would predominate over CCTC mutations because, while both UfmC and CfT dimers are produced at the same rate, UfmC is more rapidly depleted due to the accelerating effect of G on deamination. In accord with this, 45 of the 53 CT mutations at the eight CmC hotspots are CCCT mutations. Because these CCCT mutations correspond to missense mutations, it is also possible that they predominate because of some selective survival advantage conferred by the mutant protein, and not because of selective deamination. Conclusion

and 45 are CCCT single-base mutations (66%), whereas only 28 are CCTT tandem mutations (34%). Since the second deamination step in tandem deamination is much faster than the first, the doubly deaminated product is calculated from the kinetic data (Table 2) to predominate after only about 5% of the dimer has deaminated (Fig. S2). Unless replication of the dimers only takes place during this first 5% of reaction, an alternative explanation for the high percentage of single CT mutations is needed. One possibility is that excision repair of the doubly deaminated dimer (UfT·GG) is faster than the singly deaminated dimers (Ufm C·GG and CfT·GG), which would suppress CCTT mutations, as shown in the scheme in Fig. 7. We have previously found that a TfT·GA mismatched dimer destabilizes the DNA duplex by 0.7 kcal compared to a matched TfT·AA dimer,55 suggesting that a double mismatch would be even more destabilizing and hence more easily detected by the excision repair system. Indeed, a doubly mismatched dimer, TfT·GG, is repaired faster than the singly mismatched dimer TfT·GA, which is repaired at a rate similar to that of TfT·AG, both of which are repaired much faster than TfT·AA.56,57 In further support of our scheme (Fig. 7), the frequency of CCTT mutations is much higher in skin cancers from XPC patients than from non-XP patients (76% versus 8%) and occurs almost exclusively in the nontranscribed strand.58,59 At the eight C m CG hotspots, only CCTT mutations were observed. Sufferers of XPC lack the DNA damagerecognition component of nucleotide excision repair, and thus CfC dimers in the nontranscribed

Sunlight produces cis-syn dimers at PymCG sites, which correlate with C-to-T and CC-to-TT mutational hotspots found in basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Our results are consistent with a mutagenic pathway that involves spontaneous deamination of mC to T in a CPD followed by error-free translesion synthesis by pol , resulting in insertion of A opposite the T. We have discovered that deamination of mC in a CPD in duplex DNA is highly sequence dependent and is fastest for a TmCG site and slowest for a CmCG site. The observation that a CfmCG dimer deaminates the slowest, but is at the same time a hotspot for C-to-T and CC-to-TT mutations in skin cancers, suggests that repair must be slow enough at these sites to allow sufficient time for deamination. The higher incidence of CT than CCTT mutations at CmC sites, in spite of a very rapid second deamination step, might be explained by more rapid repair of the doubly deaminated dimer than the singly deaminated dimer. Our deamination data provides a baseline of comparison for future studies aimed at dissecting the effects of DNA structure, dynamics, and protein interactions on photoproduct formation, deamination, repair, and bypass, which ultimately govern the overall mutation frequency.

P-labeled substrates

In a typical experiment, 7 g of a gel-purified 21-mer ODN containing a 5-mC was end-labeled with 2 l of T4 polynucleotide kinase in a 40-l reaction mix containing

Deamination of 5-Methylcytosine in Cyclobutane Dimers 50­100 C [-32P]ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 1 h and then terminated by heating to 100 °C for 40 min. The 5-32P-labeled 21-mer oligonucleotide was ligated to a second 21-mer ODN using a short complementary ligation scaffold of 20 nucleotides. Both the second ODN and the scaffold were added in twofold molar excess over the 32P-end-labeled ODN in a volume of 144 l. This mixture was heated to 80 °C for 5 min and then allowed to slowly cool down to room temperature before adding 16 l of 10× ligation buffer supplied by the vendor and 4 l of T4 DNA ligase. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 23 °C. The next day, the reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C for 10 min to inactivate the ligase and the sample and then divided into two 80-l aliquots. A 20-mer ODN (42 g) complementary to the scaffold was added to one aliquot (sixfold molar excess over the scaffold in that aliquot). This was done in order to minimize any possible reannealing of the scaffold and ligated DNA in subsequent heating and acrylamide gel electrophoresis steps. No additions were made to the second aliquot. It is important to purify the ligated product to ensure that all radiolabeled nucleotides resulting from subsequent NP1 digestion arise only from the ligated sequence. Therefore, each aliquot was evaporated to dryness at 43 °C, resuspended in 30 l of formamide containing xylene cyanol dye marker, and then heated to 100 °C for 10 min before being loaded onto a 0.8-mm-thick acrylamide slab containing TBE and 7 M urea. The excess scaffold and its complementary sequence are easily separated by the acrylamide gel, giving close to 100% yield of single-strand ligated 42-mer product. The second sample, without the complementary scaffold sequence targeted for duplex DNA production, also ran primarily as the single-strand ligated product. In each case, phosphorimaging was used to locate the singlestrand product. A 1 × 6-cm acrylamide rectangle containing each internally labeled ligated product was cut out and crushed with a glass rod in a 50-ml plastic centrifuge tube. The internally labeled DNA was eluted in 5 ml of water after 2 days at room temperature with rapid agitation by a magnetic stir bar. After elution, the sample was centrifuged to pellet any polyacrylamide and the supernatant containing the DNA was then evaporated to 600 l. The DNA was pelleted by ethanol precipitation with 0.5 M NaCl and 3 volumes of ethanol. The sample was reprecipitated and then washed with 95% ethanol. The DNA pellet was air-dried in a 37 °C oven for 30 min before resuspension in 200 l of 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.3). The 42-mer ODN (28 g) complementary to the 42-mer ligation product was added to the sample targeted for duplex deamination studies and heated to 100 °C followed by slowly cooling to room temperature. Irradiation and deamination Each sample (about 200 l) was irradiated at 302 nm for 1 h at 4 °C on a model TR-302 Spectroline transilluminator light box in a 4 °C cold room at pH 8.3. The samples were spotted in 100-l droplets onto a single layer of clear plastic cut from a Ziploc bag. After irradiation, the separate 100-l droplets were pooled and the volume was brought up to 200 l with the addition of water. We observed about a 30% loss in volume due to evaporation. Mes buffer (pH 6.0) was added to each sample to bring the pH to 7.0, which introduced about 5 mM NaCl, and stored frozen. Deamination was carried out by quickly heating a frozen sample ( 200 l) to 37 °C, after which 10-l samples were removed at time intervals and quick-frozen

1155
on dry ice. The collected deamination samples were stored frozen at -70 °C until the photolyase step. After all the time points were collected, the remaining sample was brought to pH 6.3 and incubated at 67 °C for 16 h for complete deamination. At 67 °C, the 42-base-pair duplex dissociates into single strands, which deaminate rapidly at the lower pH. After the 16-h incubation, the pH was brought back to pH 7 by the addition of Tris buffer. Photoreversion and degradation NaCl and DTT (50 and 1 mM, respectively, in a total volume of 0.35 l) were added to each 10-l deamination sample. This was followed by the addition of 0.2 l ( 1 g) photolyase. This mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 5 min in the dark before incubation under a black light at 23 °C for 60 min. Each microfuge tube (1.5-ml size) was placed on its side so that the light source was roughly 1.3 cm from the photolyase reaction mixture at the bottom of the tube. A maximum of 20 tubes could be placed under the 32-cm-length bulb, leaving 4 cm at the ends of the bulb vacant. After photoreversion, ZnCl2 (1 mM) was added to each sample in addition to enough Mes buffer to lower the pH to 6.2. P1 nuclease (7 g in a volume of 1 l) was then added to each sample and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 23 °C. After the reaction, samples were stored at -20 °C. 2D acrylamide electrophoresis and analysis Sonicated denatured salmon sperm DNA (5 l of 10 mg/ml) was added to each sample followed by 18 l of formamide containing 0.1% SDS and xylene cyanol dye marker. Aliquots (5-l) of each sample (without heating) were loaded onto a 1-mm-thick, 30.5 × 35-cm 10% acrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and TBE buffer. The wells were 0.5 cm wide, and two wells were left empty between each sample. The xylene cyanol dye was allowed to migrate 10 cm before phosphorimaging. A long razor blade tool was used to cut a 4 × 25-cm rectangle in the gel that included the mononucleotide band. The rest of the gel was removed, leaving that piece of gel attached to the glass plate. Spacers and glass plate were then put in position for pouring of the second dimension. The second dimension was a 28% citrate acrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, which was poured in the same orientation as the original gel and allowed to polymerize vertically. Pouring the gel vertically provides much better contact with the top of the first dimension of the TBE gel. The gel was poured in three steps. First, 10 ml of the citrate gel was poured and allowed to polymerize at the bottom of the slab, providing a plug. We found that sealing the gel form with agarose alone was not effective in stopping leaks when the gel was poured in a vertical position. Second, the gel form was filled with 50 mM citrate and allowed to stand for 30 min and then poured off. We found that TBE inhibits polymerization and results in poor contact with the first-dimension gel. Third, the rest of the citrate gel could be poured at this point. Large amounts of polymerization reagents were required for the citrate gel in order to obtain good contact with the first-dimension gel (for 150 ml acrylamide, we used 3.25 mg FeSO4, 130 mg ascorbate, and 410 l of 3% H2O2). At these high concentrations, the gel would polymerize in about 3 min. The second-dimension gel was run for 4 h at 400 W in the upward direction by reversing the leads to the power supply. Phosphorimaging was used to quantify the [32P]T (or [32P]dU) and [32P]mC bands in the second-dimension

1156
citrate gel, and the fraction of deaminated band relative to the undeaminated band, F(t), corresponding to pT/U/ (pT/U + pC) was calculated for each time point. The fraction of pT/U in the sample that had been heated at 16 h at pH 6.3 to completely deaminate the dimer was taken to correspond to F() and the yield of the cis-syn photodimer. The deamination half-lives were obtained from the slope of a linear least-squares fit to a plot of the natural log of the fraction of undeaminated product, ln[(F ()-F(t))/F()], versus time.
