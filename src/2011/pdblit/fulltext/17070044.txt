Abstract--Serine protease factor Xa (fXa) inhibitor 1 showed good ex vivo anti-fXa activity upon oral administration in rats. However, it has been revealed that 1 had low metabolic stability against human liver microsomes. To improve the metabolic stability, we attempted to modify the S1 and S4 ligands of 1. These modifications resulted in compound 34b, which exhibited selective anti-fXa activity and excellent anti-coagulation activity. Ó 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Serine protease factor Xa (fXa) is a key enzyme in the cascade-like activation of the coagulation system. It holds a central position joining the extrinsic and intrinsic activation pathways1 and converts prothrombin to thrombin (fIIa). Although both fXa and thrombin play crucial roles in the coagulation cascade, compared with fXa, thrombin acts as multifunctional and its platelet activation is important for stopping hemorrhage. From this viewpoint, fXa inhibitors are expected to display less bleeding risk than do thrombin inhibitors.2 In previous reports,3 we have found that the fused ring fXa inhibitor 1 showed good ex vivo anti-fXa activity at oral administration in rats. In vitro human liver microsomal metabolic stability of compound 1 has been measured by a reported method,4 and we calculated intrinsic clearance (CLint) of this compound from the values5 (Table 1). Consequently, it has become apparent that 1 had low metabolic stability against human liver

microsomes. Similar to 1, tetrahydrothiazoropyridine derivative 2,3 which had the structure with the carbamoyl moiety removed from 1, showed low metabolic stability. On the other hand, biaryl derivative 3,6 which had the structure of tetrahydrothiazolopyridine transformed to pyridinyl-benzene, showed high stability. This finding suggested a possibility of improving metabolic stability by converting the tetrahydrothiazolopyridinyl part. fXa has two affinity sites for compound 2, which are the so-called S1 binding site and aryl binding site (S4 binding site). We have previously reported that the 5-chloroindole moiety was a better structure for the S1 site than the 6-chloronaphthalene moiety.6 An optimization study was carried out for 4, whereby the structure of the 6-chloronaphthyl moiety of 2 was transformed to 5-chloroindolyl, as a lead compound (Fig. 1). Life-threatening consequences often result from thrombosis, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, and so on. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), termed by McKay,7 is one of these disorders, and a DIC animal model is used to confirm the efficacy of anti-coagulants. DIC was originally a clinical designation for an abnormality of clotting and the fibrinolysis system resulting

Mitsunobu reaction with phthalimide gave 23. Cleavage of phthalimide with hydrazine, followed by tert-butoxycarbonylation and the Pictet­Spengler reaction gave tetrahydrooxazolopyridine 25. Diol formation from 25 with osmium tetraoxide, followed by NaIO4 oxidation and MnO2 oxidation, gave 5g. Formation of the required oxazolopyridazine skeleton was achieved starting from 2721 by the same procedure as for 5c. Preparation of 34a,b is shown in Scheme 6. Phenylsulfonylation of 5-fluoroindole (29), followed by introducing sulfonyl chloride at the 2-position, condensation of 1-tert-butoxycarbonylpiperazine, and cleavage of Boc protection, gave 32a. Carboxylation of 6d, followed by condensation with 32a,b,6 and oxidation using m-CPBA, gave 34a,b. In this condensation reaction condition, the phenylsulfonyl moiety was deprotected (6d + 32a ! 33a).

Preparation of 38a­d is shown in Scheme 7. Debenzylation of 35,22 followed by monosulfonylation at the 4-position, gave 36. Carboxylation of 6d, followed by condensation with 36, hydrolysis, amide formation with various amines, and oxidation using m-CPBA, gave 38a­d. 3. Result and discussion We predicted that the sulfur atom of thiazole and the carbon atom adjacent to nitrogen of tetrahydropyridine are the most likely candidates to be metabolized. Enzyme inhibitory activities, anti-coagulant activities, and metabolic stabilities of synthesized compounds are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Predictably, the indole derivative 4 improved in vitro anti-fXa activity, but it did not improve human metabolic stability. Transformation of thiazole to oxazole

decreased the in vitro anti-fXa activity. On the other hand, various non-aromatized transformations of the tetrahydropyridine part maintained anti-fXa activity, except for 8e. Thiazolopyridine 9a, an aromatized analogue of 4, exhibited 50-fold less anti-fXa activity than that of 4. However, 9d and f, which include a nitrogen atom at the 4 position, showed only 3-fold less antifXa activity. Moreover, 12d, an N-oxide derivative of 9d, exhibited the best anti-coagulant activity in an array of these compounds (Table 2). We have measured the in vitro human liver microsomal metabolic stability of several indole derivatives. Conversion of a sulfur atom into an oxygen atom improved human metabolic stability (4 vs 10g). However, tetrahydrooxazolopyridine 10g exhibited less satisfactory anti-fXa activity. The other potent compounds also showed a tendency to improve the metabolic stability compared with the parent compound 4. Especially, thienopyridine N-oxide 12d showed a much higher metabolic stability than 4. To determine the binding mode of 12d, we carried out an X-ray study of 12d and fXa. The statistics of data

processing and crystallographic refinement for the resulting crystal are shown in Table 4. As a result of the X-ray crystallographic analysis, the chloroindole part located in the S1 subsite with hydrogen bond formation between the nitrogen of chloroindole and the amide carbonyl oxygen of Gly218 on the main chain and a thienopyridine part located in the S4 subsite (Figs. 3 and 4). We have already reported3 that the tetrahydrothiazolopyridine part of 1 was arranged parallel to the indole ring of Trp215 (panel B). However, the thienopyridine part of 12d was arranged vertically to the indole ring of Trp215 (panel A). We have observed an intramolecular S­O close contact (thiazolopyridine-S and carbonyl-O) in the crystal complex of 1 and fXa.3 In contrast, 12d has existed without such an intramolecular S­O close contact. The coplanar location of the thienopyridine of 12d and piperazine amide carbonyl is a disadvantage for stabilizing the conformation, because of repulsion between the thienopyridine 3-H of 12d and piperazine 3 or 5-H.

calculation23 results of the model compounds A and B, illustrated in Figure 5, supported this disadvantage. DHF of conformers B-I and B-II exhibited the minimum value and the second minimum value among the respective various conformers. Because of the closest S­O proximity, the DHF of B-I was lower than that of BII. On the other hand, the DHF of conformer A-I exhibited the maximum value (Fig. 6). These results suggested that a preferable conformation of 12d would be a twisted relationship between the thienopyridine face and carbonyl face. The chloroindole part of 12d fits so tightly into the S1 binding site that its location was not flexible. Considering these structural limitations, the thienopyridine part of 12d should be arranged vertically to the indole ring of Trp215. In many crystal structural analyses of low molecular weight compounds and the fXa complex, the aromatic moiety of the ligand, which was located in the neighborhood of the phenyl ring (Phe174) and indole ring (Trp215), was arranged vertically to the indole ring of Trp215.6,24 Consequently, the conformation of 12d in that crystal structure is the

desirable conformation for stabilization of both the molecule and the binding mode to the S4 binding site. Moreover, the cationic pyridine ring interacted with the cation binding site the same as reported by others.6,24c,25 This would be the reason why 12d exhibited a 6-fold more active fXa inhibition than did 9d. The optimized study of 12d is shown in Table 3. In our X-ray study, the S1 part of 12d tightly bound to fXa and the linker part of 12d was located on the surface of fXa. We hoped that introducing a hydrophilic moiety in the piperazine ring would improve metabolic stability as a result of changing the physicochemical property without reducing the fXa activity. Therefore, we designed compounds which had carbamoyl moiety on the piperazine ring and halogen substituted 5,6 fused aromatic ring in the place of 5-chloroindole. Metabolic stability of the

benzothiophene analogue 34b was improved 80 times from 1. The rate of microsomal metabolic turnover for carbamoylmethyl derivatives was higher than that of the parent compound 34b. This approach maintained or improved the in vitro anti-fXa activity, but could not reduce the microsomal metabolism. Thienopyridine analogues, 12d and 34b, were tested in the Caco-2 assay (gastrointestinal cell assay). Much

higher permeability of 34b was observed than that of 12d in the Caco-2 system (Table 5). After oral administration of 34b to rats, at a dose of 30 mg/kg, potent antifXa activities in the plasma and prolongation ratio of the prothrombin time until 4 h were observed. The results are shown in Table 6. Equi-potent fXa inhibitors 34b and 1 were evaluated in the rat DIC model;28 the data are presented in Figures 7 and 8. A dose-dependent anti-thrombotic effect of 34b had been exhibited at doses of 1­10 mg/kg po. The dose required for 50% inhibition of platelet consumption (ID50plt) was estimated as being 6.5 mg/kg, and the dose required for 50% inhibition of TAT (thrombin­antithrombin III complex) formation (ID50TAT) was esti-

mated as being 7.3 mg/kg. In the case of 1, ID50plt and ID50TAT were calculated as being 19.4 mg/kg and 24.3 mg/kg, respectively. 4. Conclusion Compound 34b exhibited excellent anti-coagulation activity and selective anti-fXa activity. Furthermore, its metabolic stability in human microsomes was improved 80 times compared with that of 1. It has been demonstrated that this compound was highly efficacious in an animal thrombosis model. Good permeability and metabolic stability may contribute to high anti-coagulant activity in an in vivo model after oral administra-

tion. We obtained a non-basic and highly selective fXa inhibitor, and it is expected that this compound will be useful for preventing some thrombotic disorders by oral administration. 5. Experimental 5.1. General Melting points were determined with a Buchi 520 appa¨ ratus in glass capillary tubes and are uncorrected. Column chromatography was performed with Merck silica gel 60 particle size (0.060­0.200 mm or 0.040­ 0.063 mm) or Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Biosciences Corp.). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck pre-coated TLC aluminum sheets with silica gel 60 F254 and detected by UV quenching at 254 nm or by spraying with phosphomolybdic acid or ninhydrin. All analytical samples were found to be homogeneous by TLC. H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JNMEX400 spectrometer and chemical shifts are given in parts per million (d) from tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Mass spectra were performed with a JEOL JMS-AX505W (EI) or a JEOL JMS-HX110 (FD, FAB) spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on a HITACHI 270-30 spectrometer. 5.2. Preparation of the crystals Purified human Gla-less fXa was purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. Without further purification, the purchased protein sample was dialyzed against 5 mM maleate imidazole, pH 5.0/4 mM CaCl2/10 mM benzamidine, and concentrated to 7.5 mg/ml with Microcon-10 (Millipore Co., MA). Concentrated Gla-less fXa was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (15% PEG6000/1 mM CaCl2/0.3 M AcONa/0.1 M maleate imidazole, pH 5.0) and vapor-equilibrated against the same solution at 20 °C. After several days, 2 mM of compound 12d was added to the drop and then benzamidine/Gla-less fXa crystal3 was seeded to the drop by the streak-seeding method.29 The obtained micro-crystal was then grown to a sufficient size for X-ray experiments by the micro-seeding method.29 5.3. X-ray data collection and processing A co-crystal was sealed in a glass capillary together with mother liquor. An all X-ray data set was collected at room temperature on an R-Axis IIc imaging plate detector (RIGAKU, Japan) with an RU200 rotating anode generator (RIGAKU, Japan). Data processing was carried out using d*trek.30 5.4. Structure solution and crystallographic refinement A previously reported Gla-less fXa structure (PDB code 1HCG31) was used as the initial structure. Phase refinement and model rebuilding was carried out by using refmac532 and Turbo Frodo.33 Low resolution data

° (<25 A2) were included and Babinet bulk solvent scal34 ing was applied. Stereochemistry checks indicate that the refined protein model is in good agreement with expectations within each resolution range. The statistics of the crystallographic refinement are shown in Table 4. Atomic coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 2D1J). 5.5. Computational study Ab initio calculations obtaining energy profiles and point charges were performed by using the Gaussian 94 program systems35 at the RHF level of theory with the STO-3G basis set. Geometry of model compounds A and B was optimized by fixing the torsion angles of the carbamoyl moiety (O@C­N­R) at 0°. Relative energies (DHF) of each conformer were obtained for values of torsion angle (v) of the S­C­C@O moiety in the range 0­180° and are shown in Figure 6. The v value was incremented in 30° steps and fixed. The global energy minimum for each model compound A and B was normalized to 0 kcal/mol. 5.6. Anti-fXa activity in vitro Anti-fXa activity in vitro was measured by using a chromogenic substrate S-2222 (Chromogenix, Inc.) and human fXa (Cosmo Bio-ERL). Aqueous DMSO (5% v/v; 10 ll) or inhibitors in aqueous DMSO (10 ll) and 0.05 U/ml human fXa (10 ll) were mixed with 0.1 M Tris­0.2 M NaCl­0.2% BSA buffer (pH 7.4; 40 ll). The reaction was started by the addition of 0.75 M S-2222 (40 ll). After the mixture was stirred for 10 s at room temperature, the increases of optical density (OD/min) were measured at 405 nm. Anti-fXa activity (inhibition percentage) was calculated as follows: anti-fXa activity = 1 À [(OD/min) of sample/(OD/min) of control]. The IC50 value was obtained by plotting the inhibitor concentration against the anti-fXa activity. 5.7. Anti-fIIa activity in vitro Anti-thrombin activity in vitro was measured by using chromogenic substrate S-2266 (Chromogenix, Inc.) and human thrombin (Sigma Chemical, Inc.). Aqueous DMSO (5% v/v; 10 ll) or inhibitors in aqueous DMSO (10 ll) and 4 U/ml human thrombin (10 ll) were mixed with 0.1 M Tris­0.2 M NaCl­0.2% BSA buffer (pH 7.4; 40 ll). The reaction was started by the addition of 0.50 M S-2266 (40 ll). After the mixture was stirred for 10 s at room temperature, the increases of optical density (OD/min) were measured at 405 nm. Antithrombin activity (inhibition percentage) was calculated as follows: anti-thrombin activity = 1 À [(OD/min) of sample/(OD/min) of control]. The IC50 value was obtained from the inhibition percentage on the statistical probability paper. 5.8. Anti-coagulant activity in vitro Anti-coagulant activity in vitro was evaluated with the plasma clotting time doubling concentration for pro-

thrombin time (PTCT2). Plasma (20 ll) was mixed with inhibitors in saline (20 ll) in the process tube. Coagulation was started by the addition of Simplastin (Organon Teknica, Inc.) (40 ll). 5.9. Anti-fXa activity and anti-coagulant activity ex vivo Male Wistar rats were fasted overnight. Synthetic compounds were dissolved in 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose solution and administered orally to rats via a stomach tube. For control rats, 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose solution was administered orally. Rats were anesthetized with ravonal at several time points when blood samples were collected into tubes containing trisodium citrate. After blood samples were centrifuged, the platelet poor plasma samples were used for measuring their anti-fXa activities or anti-coagulant activities. Anti-fXa activity: plasma (5 ll) was mixed with 0.1 M Tris­0.2 M NaCl­ 0.2% BSA buffer (pH 7.4; 40 ll), H2O (5 ll) and 0.1 U/ ml human fXa (10 ll). The reaction was started by the addition of 0.75 M S-2222 (40 ll). After the mixture was stirred for 10 s at room temperature, the increase of optical density (OD/min) was measured at 405 nm. Anti-fXa activity (inhibition percentage) was calculated as follows; anti-fXa activity = 1 À [(OD/min) of sample/ (OD/min) of control]. Anti-coagulant activity: plasma (20 ll) was mixed with inhibitors in saline (20 ll) in the process tube. Coagulation was started by the addition of Simplastin (40 ll). Anti-coagulant activity was evaluated by comparing the prolongation rate of prothrombin time versus control. 5.10. 1-[(5-Chloroindol-2-yl)sulfonyl]-4-[(5-methyl4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-2-yl)carbonyl]piperazine hydrochloride (4) To a stirred solution of 5-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine 5a (6.43 g, 41.7 mmol) in dry THF (200 ml) was added n-BuLi (1.47 M in hexanes; 34.0 ml, 50.0 mmol) at À78 °C under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred for 40 min at À78 °C. After the bubbling of CO2 gas for 1 h, the reaction mixture was warmed up to room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. Collection of the residue and washing with hexane gave lithium 5-methyl-4,5,6,7tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-2-carboxylate (9.42 g) as a pale brown amorphous solid. To a mixture of lithium 5-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridin2-carboxylate (175 mg), 1-[(5-chloroindol-2-yl)sulfonyl]piperazine (7) (400 mg, 1.33 mmol), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (10.5 mg, 0.08 mmol), and N-methylmorpholine (86.8 mg, 0.86 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (100 ml) was added 1-(dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodimide hydrochloride (194 mg, 1.01 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 h and then concentrated in vacuo. The residue was added to H2O and AcOEt. The separated organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (AcOEt/MeOH = 10/3), and then the residue was added to 1 N HCl­EtOH and H2O. The solution was concentrated in vacuo to give 4 (68 mg, 17%) as a pale yellow powder.

To disclose conformational characteristics lurking in the 2-carbamoylthiophene moiety we performed ab initio calculations using the Gaussian 94 program for the model compounds A and B. We examined each relative energy (DHF) for the various conformers of A and B in which torsion angles (v) of the S­C­C@O moiety changed from 0° to 180°. The value of each DHF of A and B was calculated on the basis of the energy (0 kcal/mol) of conformer A150 (v = 150°) and B0 (v = 0°). (a) Maignan, S.; Guilloteau, J.; Pouzieux, S.; ChoiSledeski, Y.
