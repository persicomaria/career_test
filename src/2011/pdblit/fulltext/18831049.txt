ABSTRACT a-Aminoadipate aminotransferase (AAA-AT), a homolog of mammalian kynurenine aminotransferase II (Kat II), transfers an amino group to 2-oxoadipate to yield a-aminoadipate in lysine biosynthesis through the a-aminoadipate pathway in Thermus thermophilus. AAA-AT catalyzes transamination against various substrates, including AAA, glutamate, leucine, and aromatic amino acids. To elucidate the structural change for recognition of various substrates, we determined crystal structures of AAA-AT in four forms: with pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (PLP) (PLP complex), with PLP and leucine (PLP/ Leu complex), with N-phosphopyridoxyl-leucine (PPL) (PPL complex), and with N-phosphopyridoxyl-a-aminoadipate (PPA) at 2.67, 2.26, 1.75, and ° 1.67 A resolution, respectively. The PLP complex is in an open state, whereas PLP/Leu, PPL, and PPA complexes are in closed states with maximal dis° placement (over 7 A) of the a2 helix and the b1 strand in the small domain to cover the active site, indicating that conformational change is induced by substrate binding. In PPL and PLP/Leu complexes, several hydrophobic residues on the a2 helix recognize the hydrophobic side chain of the bound leucine moiety whereas, in the PPA complex, the a2 helix rotates to place the guanidium moiety of Arg23 on the helix at the appropriate position to interact with the carboxyl side chain of the AAA moiety. These results indicate that AAA-AT can recognize various kinds of substrates using the mobile a2 helix. The crystal structures and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that intersubunit-electrostatic interactions contribute to the elevated thermostability of this enzyme.

INTRODUCTION Lysine is an essential amino acid for higher animals, including mammals; however, there are organisms that can synthesize lysine via either of two different lysine biosynthetic pathways: through diaminopimelate, as found in plants and bacteria, or through a-aminoadipate (AAA), as found in fungi and yeast.1­3 Our previous studies revealed that the extremely thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus synthesizes lysine through AAA, following a pathway similar to that in lower eukaryotes until AAA synthesis.4­8 In these biosynthetic steps, evolutionary relationships of lysine biosynthesis against the tricarboxylic acid cycle and leucine biosynthesis are suggested.9 In contrast, the latter part of the lysine biosynthetic pathway in T. thermophilus differs from the pathway in fungi and yeast that contains saccharopine as a biosynthetic intermediate,10 but shows similarity to the conversion of glutamate to ornithine in arginine biosynthesis. We have previously cloned most genes for lysine biosynthesis from T. thermophilus and shown that lysine biosynthesis through AAA has an evolutionary relationship with other amino acid biosyntheses and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.4­8,11,12 In lower eukaryotes, the enzyme a-aminoadipate aminotransferase (AAA-AT, EC 2.6.1.39), which catalyzes the transamination reaction using 2-oxoadipate as an amino acid acceptor to yield AAA, was suggested to be involved in lysine biosynthesis13; however, the gene responsible for the reaction was not identified until recently. We cloned the gene (lysN) from T. thermophilus, which encodes a mammalian kynurenine aminotransferase (Kat) II homolog showing

AAA-AT activity.11 The mutant strain that lacks the lysN gene grows slower than the wild-type strain in minimal medium. Although addition of AAA or lysine improved growth of the mutant strain to some extent, growth of the mutant strain by adding AAA or lysine is still slower than that of the wild-type strain in minimal medium.11 This incomplete restoration of growth by addition of AAA or lysine suggests that AAA-AT encoded by lysN contributes not only to the conversion of 2-oxoadipate to AAA in lysine biosynthesis, but also to other metabolic events, for example, biosyntheses of other amino acids. We also have demonstrated that the enzyme shows distinct aminotransferase activity for branched-chain amino acids, especially leucine, as well as AAA-AT activity, suggesting its involvement in leucine biosynthesis.11 In mammals, kynurenic acid (4-hydroxy-2-quinolinecarboxylic acid) is involved in regulation of the central nerve system by acting as an antagonist at the glycine modulatory site of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and the a7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.14,15 A low kynurenic acid level in the central nerve system is correlated with several neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia and Huntington's disease.16,17 Kynurenic acid is synthesized through the irreversible transamination of kynurenine (2anthraniloylalanine), which is catalyzed mainly by kynurenine aminotransferase (Kat) I and II. Recently, crystal structures of Kat II were determined by two groups in an apo form and in the kynurenine complex, and the recognition mechanism of kynurenine was elucidated.18,19 Although the crystal structures of prokaryotic Kat II homologs, PH0207 from Pyrococcus horikoshii,20 Tm1131 (PDB entry 1VP4) from Thermotoga maritima, and multiple-substrate aminotransferase from Thermococcus profundus (PDB entry 1WST) have been reported or deposited into the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) to date, they are all in substrate-free forms, and therefore can provide only limited information on the substrate recognition mechanism in aminotransferase homologs. To elucidate the mechanism to recognize multiple substrates of AAA-AT, we have determined the crystal structures of AAA-AT in four forms: (i) PLP complex, (ii) PLP/Leu complex, (iii) PPL complex, and (iv) PPA complex. The form (i) corresponds to the apo form, whereas forms (ii), (iii), and (iv) correspond to a leucine-bound Michaelis complex, an intermediate-like form of the leucine-bound complex, and another intermediate-like form of the AAA-bound complex, respectively. By comparison of these structures along with the structural comparison with Kat II, the mechanism of substrate recognition for various compounds is discussed. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Preparation of AAA-AT

used for crystallization. To facilitate the convenient purification of AAA-AT for activity assay and thermal denaturation, we constructed an expression and purification system based on Ni-affinity chromatography. The gene encoding AAA-AT with (His)6 tag at its C-terminal end was amplified using appropriate primers, and the amplified DNA fragment with a correct sequence was introduced into the expression vector, pET-26b(1). The mutated gene encoding the Asp105Ala variant was constructed by a QuickChange kit (Stratagene-Japan, Tokyo) using appropriate oligonucleotide primers. The expression vector carrying the correct mutation was constructed in the same manner as His-tagged AAA-AT. Heat-treated crude extracts containing His-tagged AAA-AT proteins were prepared from recombinant Escherichia coli, as described in the previous report,11 and applied to a ProfinityTM IMAC Ni-charged resin (Nippon Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan) column pre-equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl). The column was washed with buffer B containing 20 mM imidazole. His-tagged AAA-AT and His-tagged Asp105Ala were then eluted with buffer B containing 500 mM imidazole. The protein fractions were pooled and concentrated, and the purity was verified by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%). The concentrations of proteins were determined by the methods of Bradford using a protein assay kit (Nippon Bio-Rad).
Crystallization of AAA-AT complexes

PPL and PPA were synthesized according to the method of Islam et al.21 Chemical structures of PLP, PPA, and PPL are shown in Figure 1(A). Crystals of PLP, PLP/Leu, PPL, and PPA complexes were obtained by the vapor diffusion method, mixing 1 lL of the purified AAA-AT, each concentrated to 6.5, 5.0, 5.0, and 4.5 mg/mL, respectively, with an equal volume of the reservoir solution within 1-3 days at 208C. For preparation of PLP and PLP/Leu complexes, 0.1 mM PLP was added into purified AAA-AT. For PPL and PPA complex formation, the enzyme solution was supplemented with 10 mM PPL and PPA, which are 91- and 100-fold excess in molar ratio to the purified AAA-AT concentration, respectively. The reservoir solution contains 17.5-18.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 100 mM tri-sodium citrate (pH 6.1-6.6) and 200 mM ammonium acetate for the PLP complex, 8-13% (w/v) PEG 6000 and 100 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.0-6.5) for the PLP/Leu complex, 18% (w/v) PEG 4000, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 200 mM lithium sulfate for the PPL complex, 18% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 200 mM potassium fluoride for the PPA complex.

Recombinant AAA-AT (without tag) was expressed and purified as described in a previous report,11 and

Crystals were flash-frozen in a cold N2 stream from a liquid-nitrogen cryostat (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). Diffraction data sets were collected with an ADSC Quantum CCD detector on the BL5 and the BL6A station at the Photon Factory in High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK). All data sets were collected at 95 K from a single crystal mounted on a cryoloop. Diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and scaled with HKL2000.22 The data of the PLP/Leu complex collected at a wave° length of 1.0 A were used for subsequent molecular replacement and crystallographic refinement. The molecular replacement of the PLP/Leu complex was performed with MOLREP23 in the CCP4 program suite24 by using the model of a monomer of a putative aminotransferase (Tm1131) from T. maritima, which is deposited in the RCSB PDB with accession number 1VP4, as a search model. Model correction in the electron density map was performed with XtalView program suite25 and Coot.26 Refinement was performed with CNS 1.127 and Refmac5.2.28 The final model contains four, six, two, and two monomers in PLP, PLP/Leu, PPL, and PPA complexes, respectively. In the PLP/Leu complex, leucine molecules are observed in the active center clefts of A, C, and E chains out of six chains, although leucine was not added in crystallization solution. The leucine molecules bound to AAA-AT are presumably derived from recombinant E. coli cells and remain bound through the purification steps. Data collection and refinement statistics and

the results of Ramachandran plots produced by the program PROCHECK29 are summarized in Table I. Although Leu268 falls in the disallowed region in each complex, excellent map fitting ensures unambiguous model building. Figures were prepared using XFIT in the XtalView program suite, Raster3D30 and Pymol [http:// pymol.sourceforge.net/]. The atomic coordinates of PLP, PLP/Leu, PPL, and PPA complexes have been deposited in the RCSB PDB with accession number 2EGY, 2ZP7, 2Z1Y, and 3CBF, respectively.
Kat assay

The enzyme reaction was initiated by adding an appropriate amount of the purified AAA-AT to 1 mL reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 0.05 mM pyridoxal 50 -phosphate, 3 mM NAD1, 11.9 U glutamate dehydrogenase per mL, 3 mM kynurenine, and 50 mM 2-oxoglutarate), which was preincubated at 458C for 5 min. The reaction was monitored at 458C by measuring the increase in absorption at 340 nm of NADH. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that reduced 1 lmol NADH per min at 458C in the reaction.
Thermal denaturation

Purified His-tagged wild-type AAA-AT and Asp105Ala enzyme were applied onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare Bioscience Japan, Tokyo) equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The protein

Overall structure of AAA-AT

First, we describe the structure of the PPA complex, ° which is determined at the highest resolution of 1.67 A, to explain the overall AAA-AT structure. AAA-AT forms ° a dimer with a large intersubunit interface of 7058 A2. Each monomer is divided into three structural domains: an N-terminal arm (Ser5-Ala19), a small domain composed of two regions (Ser20-Lys45 and Phe285-Ala395), and a large domain (Leu46-Gly284) [Fig. 1(B)], which is similar to aspartate aminotransferase (Asp-AT) from T. thermophilus31 and aromatic aminotransferase (Aro-AT) from Paracoccus denitrificans.32 The program secondary

structure matching algorithm SSM (www.ebi.ac.uk/msdsrv/ssm) was used to search for proteins from the PDB database possessing three-dimensional structures similar to that of AAA-AT. High Z scores (strength of structural similarity) about 12 with r.m.s.d ranging from 1.6 to ° 1.8 A were obtained for several enzymes, all of which are classified into aminotransferase fold-type I. Top hit was multiple-substrate aminotransferase from T. profundus (Z ° score of 12.3 and r.m.s.d of 1.6 A). Fold-type I aminotransferases were classified into seven subgroups, Ia to Ix, by Jensen and Gu.33 Later Iraqui et al. proposed that Kat II and Aro-AT proteins (Aro8p and Aro9p) should constitute a new subfamily among fold-type I aminotransferases, distinguishing the members of the new subgroup as an enzyme specialized for aromatic amino acids and a-aminoadipate13,34; however, no phylogenetic analysis has been performed until now. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Kat II and Kat II homologs, including AAA-AT and Aro-AT, do not belong to any existing subgroups, but form a separate lineage [Fig. 2(A)]. This

indicates that Kat II and its homologs actually form a new subgroup in fold-type I aminotransferases.
Structural rearrangement in forming the PPA complex

In the PLP complex, one PLP molecule is bound in a cleft in each subunit and stabilized by a set of specific interactions [Fig. 3(A)]. The C40 atom of PLP is covalently bound to the e-amino group of Lys238 forming internal aldimine (Schiff base) linkage. The 30 -phenolic hydroxyl group of PLP makes hydrogen bonds with the

side chain of Tyr205 and with the side chain amide nitrogen of Asn174. The pyrimidine nitrogen atom of ° PLP makes salt bridges (2.7, 3.4 A) with Asp202. The pyrimidine ring is sandwiched between Tyr125 and Ala204. The phosphate group of PLP makes salt bridges (2.7, ° 2.8 A) with guanidium group nitrogens of Arg245 and is hydrogen-bonded with the side chain hydroxyl oxygens of Ser235 and Ser237 and with the main chain amide of Gln101. The phosphate group is also stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr70 from another chain. We have not yet determined the crystal structure of AAA-AT without PLP.

After structures of the PPL and PPA complexes were superimposed on that of the PLP complex to show the smallest r.m.s.d for all the atoms, the distance of Ca atom between corresponding residues was measured and used as an index of Ca atom displacement upon substrate binding. Displacements between the PLP and PPA complexes are shown as black triangles and lines. Displacement between the PLP and PPL complexes are shown as gray boxes and lines. N-terminal arm, small domain, and large domain are indicated by N, S, and L, respectively.

other hand, crystal structure of a Kat II homolog PH0207 was determined without PLP in an open form with a2-helix apart from the catalytic site. When the structure of the PLP complex of AAA-AT is compared with that of PH0207 without PLP, a little conformational changes, for example, rotation (about 908) of the aromatic ring of conserved Tyr125 and displacement of several residues on a2 helix, are observed (not shown). These observations suggest that PLP-binding does not cause a large conformational change of AAA-AT. In Asp-AT (EcAsp-AT) from E. coli, torsion between the pyridine ring and the imine bond of PLP-Lys258 aldimine is the principal determinant of its low pKa value.38 Distorted conformation of the aldimine is maintained by the hydrogen bond of O30 of PLP to the amide side chain of Asn194, the hydroxyl group of the Tyr225 side chain. Asp222 forms a hydrogen bond to pyridine N atom, which serves to lower the pKa value of aldimine and maintain the distorted structure. In addition, EcAspAT undergoes open-to-closed conformational change upon substrate binding, which forces the carbonyl O atom of Gly38 to interact with the hydroxyl group of Tyr225. The unprotonated aldimine causes repulsion with the lone pair electrons of the carbonyl O atom of Gly38, which results in elevating the activation energy level of the Michaelis complex, thereby decreasing the activation-free energy between the Michaelis complex and the torsion state to promote catalytic function.39 The Asp-AT Asn194, Asp222, Tyr225, Gly38, and Lys258 are completely conserved in AAA-AT as Asn174, Asp202, Tyr205, Gly40, and Lys238 in the structure [Fig. 3(A)],

suggesting that the transaminating mechanism of AAAAT is similar to that in Asp-AT. The overall structure of the PPA complex is similar to that of the PLP complex. The PLP moiety of the PPA complex is recognized in a manner similar to that of the PLP moiety in the PLP complex, although the covalentbond partner of C40 atom switches from Lys238 to the amino group of the a-aminoadipate moiety and the pyrimidine ring rotates by 29 degrees [Fig. 3(B)]. Compared with the PLP complex, the small domain moves to close the active site cleft upon binding the substrate [Figs. 1(A) and 3(C)] as is the case for other fold-type I aminotransferases,32,40,41 although the movement is ° not so great in total; r.m.s.d. is 0.8 A for all Ca atoms. Larger displacement to recognize PPA is observed in lim° ited portions of the small domain: a-helices, a2 (5.3 A), ° ° ° a13 (2.1 A), and a14 (0.9 A), and b-sheets, b1 (2.7 A) ° ) [Fig. 3(D) and 4]. The largest displaceand b12 (1.6 A ° ment, 7.0 A, is found in Pro32 on the turn between the a2 helix and the b1 strand. The a-aminoadipate moiety of PPA is recognized by several electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. Its a-carboxyl group forms an ion pair with Arg386 and a hydrogen bond with Asn174 and Gly40, and a-amino group forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr205 [Fig. 5(B)]. The gcarboxyl group of a-aminoadipate forms an ion pair with Arg23 and its side chain forms hydrophobic interactions with Ile22, Leu41, Tyr70*, and Leu268* (asterisk indicates residues from another subunit). The conserved Ser20 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain amide of Arg23. In addition, Arg23, which recognizes the a-carboxyl group of the AAA moiety of PPA in the PPA complex, forms a hydrogen bond with both the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr73* and the main chain carbonyl of Ser71* from another subunit. The intersubunit hydrogen bonds stabilize the orientation of Arg23 to interact with the acidic substrate. In contrast, such interactions are not observed in the PLP complex, which is in an open form [Fig. 5(A)]. These interactions seem to serve as an ``inter-subunit patch'' for domain closure, which is necessary for substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism, as well as an ``inter-domain patch'', which is important for substrate-binding-induced domain closure and conformational change toward the transition state, as seen in EcAsp-AT.41 This observation indicates that the functional oligomeric state of AAA-AT to show biological activity is a dimer. Dimeric assembly of AAA-AT was also supported by gel-filtration profile of AAA-AT (not shown). Another major conformational difference is seen in a conserved residue, Gly40. In the PLP complex, Gly40 protrudes into the substrate binding site, whereas ° Gly40 is displaced in the PPA complex by 2.0 A allowing the C-terminal region of the a2 helix to form a hydrogen bond between the main chain amide of Gly40 and the a-carboxyl group of the AAA moiety of PPA [Fig. 5(B)].

The PLP moiety sits roughly on the position as seen in the PPA complex [Fig. 3(B)], and the a-carboxyl group and the a-amino group of the leucyl moiety are recognized in a manner similar to those of the AAA moiety in the PPA complex. Different from the PPA complex, however, the a2 helix rotates about 45 degrees to interact with the hydrophobic leucyl moiety of PPL [Fig. 5(C)]. Consequently, the hydrophobic side chain of the leucyl

moiety of PPL is stabilized through hydrophobic interactions with Ile22, Leu25, Leu26, Leu41, Tyr70*, and Leu268*. Most interestingly, in the PPL complex, the conserved Arg23 residue changes its side-chain orientation to interact with Glu74*, Gln257*, and Gln261* from another subunit, accompanied by a similar flip of another conserved residue, Ser20, to form a hydrogen bond with Gln261*. Thus, in the PPL complex, a different set of residues form another ``inter-subunit patch'' to stabilize the substrate-binding form. The conserved residue, Arg23, which plays a role in directly recognizing the carboxyl side chain moiety of AAA in the PPA complex, has crucial role in this inter-subunit patch necessary for substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism in this complex. Alteration of the dihedral angle of Gly40 is also seen in this complex. Substrate recognition in the PLP/ Leu complex is essentially the same as in the PPL complex, although the interaction with bound leucine seems slightly weaker than that found in the PPL complex [Fig. 5(D)].
Role of the a2 helix in recognition of various substrates

The structural comparison stated above indicates that both the mobility of the a2 helix to fix the substrate-recognizing residues at the active site and its ability to function as the inter-subunit patch are important factors in the reaction of various substrates of this enzyme. When the PPA (or PPL) form is compared with the PLP form, rotation of the a2 helix is found to initiate from Ala19, which is conserved as Ala or Ser in prokaryotic Kat II

homologs [Fig. 2(B)], suggesting a common mechanism for the movement of the a2 helix upon substrate binding. Similar substrate-assisted small-domain movement was reported for Asp-AT. In mitochondrial Asp-AT from chicken (mAsp-AT), substrate induces the small domain movement toward the large domain.41 Although both mAsp-AT and AAA-AT show small-domain movement upon substrate binding, the movements differ. In mAspAT, roughly speaking, the small domain moves as a rigid body toward the large domain, whereas in AAA-AT only a limited portion, a2-b1, of the small domain responds ° to the substrate binding and shows a larger shift (8.7 A) to close the active site. In Asp-AT from T. thermophilus (TtAsp-AT), the Nterminal region (Lys13-Val30) of the small domain moves to the active center to interact with the substrate analog, maleate.31 Thr17 and Ser15 on the helix corresponding to the a2 helix in AAA-AT are involved in recognizing the carboxyl side-chain of maleate. Therefore, it can be said that the motion upon substrate binding of AAA-AT is similar to TtAsp-AT from the viewpoint that a limited portion, an a helix, in the N-terminal region of the small domain undergoes distinct movement. TtAsp-AT has a unique feature that a residue, Lys109, which plays the primary role in interaction with the carboxyl side chain of the substrate, comes from the large domain showing no significant movement upon substrate binding. TtAspAT specifically catalyzes transamination between aspartate and glutamate42 and does not catalyze the reaction for aromatic or hydrophobic substrates. In the reaction, this enzyme recognizes both the acidic amino acids in essen-

tially the same closed form, which contrasts with the cases of AAA-AT that changes the closed form conformation depending on the substrate, as revealed by crystal structures in this study. Similar to AAA-AT, branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase from E. coli (EcBc-AT) recognizes glutamate, leucine, valine, and isoleucine specifically.43 In EcBc-AT, the catalytic cleft contains hydrophobic residues, Phe36, Tyr126, Tyr129, Tyr164, Tyr31*, and Val109*, to recognize the hydrophobic side-chain of the substrates44 and the hydrophilic residues, Arg97, and Tyr31*, to accept hydrophilic glutamate.45 Using these residues, EcBc-AT undergoes minimum conformational change to interact with two different types of substrates. In contrast, AAA-AT changes its conformation through induced fit mechanisms and interacts with leucine by facing the hydrophobic cluster to the leucyl side-chain. Thus, both AAA-AT and EcBc-AT can recognize branched-chain amino acids; however, the mechanisms are quite different from each other. Nevertheless, the strong activity, especially for leucine, found in AAA-AT may suggest that AAA-AT contributes to leucine biosynthesis to a certain extent in T. thermophilus.
Structural comparison with human Kat II

groups.18,19 The most striking difference between the structures of Kat II and AAA-AT is the domain swapping that occurs in Kat II. Since structural comparison between Kat II and prokaryotic homologs are shown in the reports, details for the domain swapping are not described here. In brief, a region, Lys49-Glu65, forms a long a helix, a3, in AAA-AT, whereas the amino terminal half of the corresponding region has a different structure of b-turn-b, forming a double-stranded anti-parallel bsheet, b1 and b2, in Kat II. Because of the difference in the secondary structure of this region, the a2 helix is oriented to cover the active site of the same subunit in AAA-AT, while the corresponding helix, a2, interacts with another subunit of the dimer in Kat II. Irrespective of the difference in topology, a2 helix has the same role in covering the active site cleft and interacting with the substrates in both structures (see Fig. 6). In the Kat II/ kynurenine complex, the a-carboxyl group of kynurenine interacts with Arg399 and Asn202, and the a-amino group of kynurenine is recognized by Gly39*, which are conserved as Gly40 in AAA-AT, suggesting very similar recognition in AAA-AT. The amino group of the phenolic ring of kynurenine forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr142, and the aromatic ring of kynurenine is stabilized by hydrophobic interaction with Leu293* along with the pcation interaction46 with Arg20* (see Fig. 6). These residues are highly conserved in AAA-AT. The only difference is that residues that recognize the side-chain of kynurenine are mostly derived from another subunit, while they are in the same subunit in AAA-AT. Conservation of these residues may imply that AAA-AT recognizes kynurenine in a manner similar to that in Kat II, although this hypothesis must be verified by determination of the crystal structure of AAA-AT/kynurenine complex. If it is turned out to be the case, there will be another sub-

Recently, the crystal structures of human Kat II have been reported by two different

AAA-AT from T. thermophilus is a highly thermostable enzyme with melting temperature over 958C (see Fig. 7). It is said that electrostatic interaction is one of the key factors conferring elevated thermostability on thermostable enzymes.47 In AAA-AT, Asp105 and Lys109 on the a5 helix interact electrostatically with Lys109* and Asp105*, respectively, on the a5 helix from another subunit (see Fig. 8). No such interaction is observed in Kat II with the corresponding residues Cys22 and Glu126, respectively (not shown), suggesting that the intersubunit electrostatic interaction contributes to the high thermostability of AAA-AT. To verify this hypothesis, altered AAA-AT with Asp105Ala replacement was constructed and its thermostability was analyzed. As expected, the denaturation temperature of the resulting enzyme markedly decreased to 808C (see Fig. 7). This result indicates that intersubunit electrostatic interaction is responsible for the elevated thermostability of AAA-AT. Crystal structures were determined for other Kat II homologs, Tm1131, PH0207, and multiple-substrate aminotransferase, all from hyperthermophiles. Interestingly, there is a stronger electrostatic interaction network in the region via Asp134/Arg138 of PH0207 which corresponds to that containing Asp105/Lys109 pairs in AAA-AT. These observations suggest that strong electrostatic interaction around this region is one of the key elements that contribute to elevating the thermostability of the Kat II homolog.
Biological implications

AAA-AT can recognize multiple a-amino and a-keto compounds as substrates, although the main function is in lysine biosynthesis. By determination of the crystal structures in several forms, the ability of AAA-AT to recognize various compounds as substrates is found to be derived from the high mobility of the a2 helix. Preliminary results show that AAA-AT can catalyze a transamination reaction of aromatic amino acids (data not shown), suggesting that AAA-AT recognizes aromatic amino acids in a manner similar to that found in Kat II for kynurenine. All the microorganisms, mostly hyperthermophilic archaea, that are suggested to synthesize lysine through AAA, have Kat II homologs and all the homologs possess residues, Arg23 and Ser20, that are important for this unique substrate recognition mechanism. Therefore, we speculate that these homologs show similar wide substrate specificity and have physiological functions in lysine biosynthesis and possibly other amino acid biosyntheses.
