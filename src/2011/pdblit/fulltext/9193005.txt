SUMMARY

I. The binding of 3-methylFAD and 3-carboxymethylFAD to lipoamide dehydrogenase apoprotein was studied. The methyl derivative is bound quite elfectively in a process very similar to that of the binding of FAD. The binding is accompanied by a large increase of the activity with DCIP at all temperatures, followed by a decline at temperatures above 5 °. During the decline the activity with oxidized lipoate increases. With the carboxymethyl analogue only a small increase of DCIP activity is observed. The association constants for these derivatives are smaller than 1or FAD. 2. The pH-dependent fluorescence of the derivatives is very similar to that of FAD, indicating that they are also internally complexed. 3. The sedimentation pattern of an enzyme containing 3-methylFAD indicates that the activity with oxidized lipoate is as with the FAD-holoenzyme connected with the dimer.

INTRODUCTION

The recombination of the apoenzyme of lipoamide dehydrogenase 'NADH: lipoamide oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.4.3) with FAD was studied and some of th~ characteristics of this process delineated in the preceding paper 1. These included changes in polarization and intensity of fluorescence as well as activities on both an artificial substrate, DCIP, and the more natural substrate, lipoic acid. One of the features was the almost instantaneous binding of most of the FAD, as can be deduced from ;t prompt increase in polarization. To obtain more detailed information about the sequence of the reactions following the attachment of the flavin, recombination with analogues of FAD has now been examined. The 3-methyl- and 3-carboxymethylFAD, compounds alkylated at the 3-imino position in the isoalloxazine system of the flavin-adenine dinucleotide, were used for this purpose.

The 3-niethyl-, 3-carboxym e t h y l - a n d 2 - m o r p h o l i n o F A D was synthesized via their mono p h o s p h a t e esters2, 3 b y condensation with 5 - p h o s p h o r o m o r p h o l i d a t e 4 and in p a r t was a gift from Prof. P. HEMMERICH (Konstanz). The enzyme and the a p o e n z y m e were p r e p a r e d and a c t i v i t y m e a s u r e m e n t s p e r f o r m e d as m e n t i o n e d p r e v i o u s l y 1 using the same definitions for calculating specific activities.

Recombination

Samples were w i t h d r a w n at the t e m p e r a t u r e s and times i n d i c a t e d to measure activities.

Fluorescence polarization
The technique a n d a p p a r a t u s used were essentially the same as those described beforeL However, as the emission i n t e n s i t y a n d polarization of fluorescence of the F A D analogues b o u n d to the r e c o n s t i t u t e d enzyme were unknown, the m e t h o d of BARLEY AND RADDAa or the one described b y LAURENCE 6 could only be used for the calculation of the fraction of b o u n d analogue b y assuming t h a t these values were the same as for F A D b o u n d to the holoenzyme. The vertical and horizontal vectors of i n t e n s i t y were corrected for c o n t r i b u t i o n s from the a p o e n z y m e itself. The fraction of flavin which is b o u n d enables one to calculate the association constants. The n u m b e r of b i n d i n g sites was calculated using the e q u a t i o n derived b y KLOTZ v.

RESULTS

Restoration of activities Tim effectiveness of 3-methyl- and 3-carboxymethylFAD relative to FAD in restoring tile diaphorase activity can be seen from tile data in Fig. x. In comparison to activities with FAD, those obtained with the 3-methyl analogue are reisonably high, but those with the 3-carboxymethyl derivative are low. For example ;tt io tzM concentration, the 3-carboxymethylFAD shows only 5 % of the activity restored by FAD while 60% is restored by the 3-methyl derivative. A similar experiment with

2-morpholinoFAD showed this compound to be inactive*. In Table I are given the maximum values of the specific activities in the diaphorase and lipoate dehydrogenase reactions after incubation with FAD and its 3-substituted analogues. As seen previously 1, the maximal diaphorase activity is obtained in the first minutes after incubating the apoenzyme with FAD on ice. Again both the 3-methyland the 3-carboxymethylFAD's partially restore the DCIP activity; both analogues are less coenzymatically active than FAD; the 3-carboxymethylFAD is least active. The amount of activity with oxidized lipoate restored after raising the temperature indicates that the analogues are less able to replace FAD. The 3-methylFAD

The recombination with the derivatives is strongly temperature dependent as is the case with F A D itself. Fig. 2 shows the results obtained at 2 different temperatures. Over the temperature range from o ° to 25 °, D C I P activity increases practically linearly to a plateau in the presence of 3-carboxymethylFAD.

activity with D C I P is still rather linear at o °, while at higher temperatures it shows similarities to the behavior of F A D (cf. ref. I).

Fluoresce~zce changes The fluorescence-pH profiles of FAD and its 3-alkyl derivatives are given in Fig. 4. As with FAD, both 3-carboxymethyl- and 3-methylFAD exhibit maxima for fluorescence intensity near pH 2.5. In all cases the fluorescence decreases toward neutral p H with a midpoint at pH 3.5 indicative of the pKa for protonation of the 6-amino group of adenosine s. Relatively low fluorescence is seen from mildly acid to slithtly alkaline solutions wherein these flavins are intramolecularly complexed 9. Thus the FAD analogues like FAD are presented as internally complexed species to the apoenzyme. The fact that the fluorescence characteristics of the derivative~ are very

similar to those of FAD justifies the assumptions made for the calculation of the association constants, i.e. they show the same increase in fluorescence upon binding to the protein. The patterns for change in polarization and intensity of fluorescence are given in Fig. 5 for the binding of the methylFAD at 2o °. The polarization increases rapidly within the first minute; after this it keeps increasing, but much more slowly. The intensity also increases rapidly in a way grossly similar to the changes in polarization. The recombination with 3-methylFAD is very similar to that of FAD over the whole temperature range studied; however, the polarizations are somewhat less. The relatively small increase in polarization which characterizes the 3-carboxymethylFAD system, indicates that the affinity of this derivative for the protein is lower than those with FAD or the 3-methyl analogue. This low affinity of 3-carboxymethylFAD, in combiBiochim. Biophys. Acta, i59 (1968) 257-264

nation with a lower activity at saturating concentrations for the activity with DCIP, explains the shape of the saturation curve of Fig. I. The fluorescence polarizations as well as intensities of the free flavin-analogues were determined. The 3-carboxymethyl- and the 3-methyl FAD do not differ from FAD with respect to the polarization. All the p values found were between o.o2,~ and o.o32 and are practically temperature independent. A sample of apoenzyme (DCIP activity, 8o~}~, activity with oxidized lipoate, less than 3°~o) was reconstituted with excess 3-methylFAD, precipitated with (NH4)2SO4, and extensively dialyzed against o.o3 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) which contained o.3 mM EDTA. The polarization of fluorescence of the 3-methylFAD bound to this reconstituted enzyme was o.37, determined at IO°. This is in fair agreement with values obtained for the FAD-containing lipoamide dehydrogenase (o.38). This reconstituted enzyme showed an activity with oxidized lipoate of 17 °/o and a DCIP activity of 33o %, indicating that the physiological activity is also partially restored. The value ofo.37 was used for the polarization of both the bound 3-methylFAD and 3-carboxymethylFAD in the calculations. The association constants are average values from at least 4 independent experiments using different flavin : apoenzyme ratios. By the method of KLoxz~ it was calculated that I.O 1.2 moles flavin analogue was bound per 5 o ooo g of apoenzyme, a value which is close to the one obtained with FAD (cf. ref. I). A preliminary experiment with a small amount of purified 3-methyl FADcontaining enzyme shows that the absorption spectrum has maxima around 454 m,u and 35 ° m3, and minima around 41o m/, and 33 ° m/~. Because the solution was slightly turbid these values are not accurate. Since the spectrum shows a shoulder between 465 and 485 m#, one can nevertheless conclude that this FAD analogue is bound in a way similar to FAD. Fig. 6 shows that the sedimentation patterns of reconstituted 3-methylFADcontaining lipoamide dehydrogenase maintain a very sharp peak which is asymmetrical

and skewed to the side of the meniscus, which suggests heterogeneity. The rather low ionic strength and dissociation phenomena, as suggested by the high DCIP activity, may both be responsible for this. Sedimentation coefficients were calculated from the top of the peak. At 7 °, 12 ° and 17 ° the respective values are 4.1, 4.9 and 5.2 S. An average S2o,~,, value of 6.o S can be calculated from these results. Extrapolation to zero protein concentration was not possible, as there was not enough material available.

LIPOAMIDE DEHYDROGENASE. I I DISCUSSION

263

The present finding that the apoenzyme of lipoamide dehydrogenase is able to recombine with FAD analogues is of real significance in studying flavin-protein interactions. Up to now, FAD-analogues have been tested for their coeuzymatic functions almost exclusively on the apoenzylne of D-alnino acid oxidase, ltowever, the results now obtained emphasize that one cannot appraise coenzylne function on the basis of only one enzyme. Replacement of FAD by the two 3-alkyl derivatives in the lipoalnide dehydrogenase resulted in reasonably active complexes with the artificial substra~e DCIP. As to physical properties, the 3-1nethyl- as well as the 3-carboxylnethylFAD do not differ very much from FAD, e.g. the redox potentials are the same TM. S w c t r a and fluorescence behavior are also practically the same. Apparently the equilibria, between the internally quenched complexes of the 3-alkyl analogues and their open fluorescent forms, evidenced by fluorescence-pH profiles, are similar to that of FAD (ref. IO). This suggests that replacement of the 3-imino hydrogen of FAD by a substitu,~nt which is larger or negatively charged does not markedly influence the ability tc fi~rln an intramolecular nonfluorescent complex. The increase in fluorescence polarization upon addition of the 3-alkyl analogues, as with FAD, reflects the binding process. Moreover, since the unbound flavins are less fluorescent than when bound, the increase in their intensities must :effect an opening of their intralnolecular complexes upon association with the enzvlne. The analogues cannot fully replace FAD. This is not surprising as the association ~'onstants have been shown to be different. From the midpoints of the saturation curves (see Fig. I) one can calculate the association constants only approximately, as the m a x i m u m obtainable velocities are uncertain. These are assumed for the DCIP actixity to be 2000% and 13oo % of the value of holoenzyme for the FAD and the 3-1neth~'l derivative, respectively. However, the latter value is quite uncertain, since saturating concentrations of the methyl derivative were not applied. The fact that 3-substitut,~d flavins are able to be bound to form an active enzyme indicates that the 3-position is not involved primarily in the binding to the protein as has been proposed p r , viously TM for other flavoproteins (cf. ref. 14). Recently DE I(OK, SPENCER AND WEBER 15 concluded from lifetime studies that upon binding FAD to lipoamide dehydrogenase, the complex between the isoalloxazine nucleus and the adenine moiety is broken. The fluorescence quenching of the bound flavin is probably due to another group in the vicinity of the flavin. The slow increase of the fluorescence intensity towards its maximum in comparison with the rapid initial phase (cf. ref. I) indicates that a series of consecutive reactions is involved in this binding process.
