The crystal structure of the `blue' copper protein plastocyanin from the cyanobacterium Phormidium laminosum has been Ê solved and re®ned using 2.8 A X-ray data. P. laminosum plastocyanin crystallizes in space group P43212 with unit-cell Ê dimensions a = 86.57, c = 91.47 A and with three protein molecules per asymmetric unit. The ®nal residual R is 19.9%. The structure was solved using molecular replacement with a search model based on the crystal structure of a close homologue, Anabaena variabilis plastocyanin (66% sequence identity). The molecule of P. laminosum plastocyanin has 105 amino-acid residues. The single Cu atom is coordinated by the same residues ± two histidines, a cysteine and a methionine ± as in other plastocyanins. In the crystal structure, the three molecules of the asymmetric unit are related by a noncrystallographic threefold axis. A Zn atom lies between each pair of neighbouring molecules in this ensemble, being coordinated by a surface histidine residue of one molecule and by two aspartates of the other.

1. Introduction
Plastocyanin is a small (Mr 10 000±12 000) `blue' copper protein (`type 1', `cupredoxin'). It plays an essential role in oxygenic photosynthesis, where its function is to carry electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to the P700+ complex of Photosystem I (PSI). Its reactions with cytochrome f and P700+ are interesting examples of long-range electron transfer in proteins. These reactions have been intensively studied for the proteins and complexes of higher plants, but a full understanding in terms of the molecular structures and physical properties of the proteins concerned remains elusive (Redinbo et al., 1994). All known higher plant plastocyanins have a negative overall charge, and it is clear that the diffusive interactions of plastocyanin with its reaction partners are strongly in¯uenced by the electrostatic properties of the molecules. A group of conserved acidic residues at the socalled `remote' site has been implicated (Lee et al., 1995; Kannt et al., 1996; Hibino et al., 1996; Hippler et al., 1996). Recent NMR evidence favours a two-step mechanism in which the acidic residues on plastocyanin initially provide electrostatic guidance for `docking' with a group of basic residues on cytochrome f (Ubbink et al., 1998). The transient bimolecular complex formed in this way is thought to have many rapidly exchanging orientations and to undergo a rearrangement which establishes an electron-transfer pathway by bringing His87 (the `northern' histidine) of plastocyanin into contact with the haem group of the cytochrome (Ubbink et al., 1998). Plastocyanins from cyanobacteria, on the other hand, have only a small negative or even a positive total charge, and

reduced states. The absorbance ratio A278/A598 for the pure oxidized protein was 2.0. The recombinant protein was shown to be identical with a sample of native plastocyanin isolated directly from cells of P. laminosum (Varley et al., 1995) by UV/visible spectroscopy, one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrometry, electrospray mass spectrometry, redox potentiometry and isoelectric focusing. Full details of the above methods and results will be provided elsewhere. In order to ensure that the protein used for crystallization had metal sites fully occupied by CuII, 1 ml of PlPc solution was concentrated from 1.36 to 9 mg mlÀ1 in a Centricon (Millipore; cutoff 1 kDa) with successive washes of 2 ml of 1 mM CuCl2, 3 ml of 0.1 M Tris (pH 8), 2 ml of 1 mM potassium ferricyanide and 3 ml of Tris.
2.2. Crystallization, data collection and processing

sequence alignments indicate that the conserved acidic residues of the plant proteins have largely been replaced by neutral or basic residues. The ®nding that electron transfer to the plastocyanin of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 occurs via a collisional mechanism has been attributed to the absence of an acidic patch (Romero et al., 1998). In the case of the weakly acidic (pI 5.2) plastocyanin from the cyanobacterium Phormidium laminosum, the effects of ionic strength on the reaction with the cytochrome b6f complex suggest that the electrostatic interactions found in plants are reversed, and that local positive charges on plastocyanin attract local negative charges on cytochrome f (Wagner et al., 1996). The need to explain this interaction in molecular terms led to an interest in the molecular structure and thus provided the motivation for the present work.

PlPc was initially crystallized from Hampton Crystal Screen 1 condition #45 (Hampton Research Ltd). A ®ne search around this condition gave the best crystals in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 6.0, 0.2 M zinc acetate and 15%(v/v) PEG 8000. The square-pyramidal blue crystals grew to 0.35 Â 0.28 Â 0.28 mm in several weeks at 277 K. No crystals were obtained in the absence of zinc acetate. X-ray data were recorded on an R-AXIS II imaging-plate detector mounted on an RU-200 rotating-anode generator with a Cu target and focusing-mirror optics (Z. Otwinowski & G. Johnson, Yale University, as marketed by Molecular Structure Corporation, Texas, USA). All data were integrated and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, Ê 1993). Native data to 2.8 A were collected at 293 K from three Ê crystals (P43212; a = 86.57, c = 91.47 A, Z = 24, three molecules per asymmetric unit). Details of data-merging statistics are given in Table 1.

2.1. Protein expression and puri®cation

The starting point for the preparation of recombinant plastocyanin of P. laminosum (PlPc) was the plasmid pPLL6B, which included a DNA fragment containing the petE gene and ¯anking regions (Varley et al., 1995). The sequence corresponding to the mature protein plus its leader sequence was ampli®ed by the polymerase chain reaction and used to prepare a plasmid (pETPC) derived from the high expression plasmid pET11d. The construct was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The transformed cells were grown overnight on plates containing ampicillin. Recombinants were isolated and used for preparation of plastocyanin. PlPc was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS grown overnight in the presence of 100 mM copper acetate, 0.2 mM isopropylthio--d-galactoside as inducer and 100 mg mlÀ1 ampicillin. Mature protein was secreted into the periplasmic space. After harvesting the cells, the periplasmic contents were obtained by osmotic shock and the protein was puri®ed by a series of chromatographic procedures involving ion exchange and gel ®ltration with the protein in both oxidized and

The structure was solved by molecular replacement (MR) using AMoRe (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994; Navaza, 1994). The search model was taken from the crystal structure of Anabaena variabilis plastocyanin (AvPc) at Ê 1.7 A resolution (Fields et al., 1999). The amino-acid sequence of PlPc is 66% identical to that of AvPc, with no insertions, deletions or terminal extensions. The search model comprised one of the two nearly identical molecules in the asymmetric unit of AvPc, with non-glycine residues truncated at C. The active-site Cu atom was omitted in order to provide a means of validating subsequent MR solutions. A self-rotation function was calculated, but was not interpretable since the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit was not known unequivocally. The calculated values of the solvent content VM for two or four molecules per asymmetric Ê unit, 3.7 or 1.9 A3 DaÀ1, were both within the range normally observed (Matthews, 1977). When the structure was eventually solved, it was found to be consistent with the selfrotation function (see below). A cross-rotation function (RF) was calculated using normalized structure-factor amplitudes

Ê (Driessen & Tickle, 1994) in the resolution range 10±3 A using AMoRe. The top 100 solutions from the RF progressed to the translation function (TF) stage. TF and ®t-function (FF) calculations were carried out in the enantiomorphic space groups P41212 and P43212. The solutions in space group P43212 had a higher self-consistency and statistical signi®cance. The positions of the three molecules comprising the ®nal solution were found in a stepwise manner. In space group P43212, the best FF solution [(1, 2, 3) = (33.0, 42.6, 320.7 ), (x, y, z) = (0.337, 0.390, 0.261); 4.5'] was ®xed, and was used to phase a further round of TF/FF. This yielded a second signi®cant peak [(1, 2, 3) = (64.9, 55.4, 184.14 ), (x, y, z) = (0.146, 0.116, 0.701)]. A third round of TF/FF, in which both solutions were ®xed, yielded a third peak [(1, 2, 3) = (32.8, 66.3, 78.6 ), (x, y, z) = (0.886, 0.593, 0.548)]. The molecules corresponding to these three solutions were found to be related by a non-crystallographic threefold rotation axis, which was consistent with the peak at 3 = 54.7, 9 = 45.0, = 120 in the self-rotation function calculated with POLARRFN (Collaborative Computational Project, Number   4, 1994). An (|Fo| À |Fc|, calc) electron-density difference map calculated from these coordinates contained a strong well de®ned peak at the putative Cu-atom position of each of the È three molecules. Rigid-body re®nement in X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992), in which ®rst the trimer and then the three separate molecules were treated as rigid bodies, led to small decreases in the residuals R (from 48.1 to 47.9%) and Rfree (from 49.4 to 48.3%). The value of Rfree in these and subsequent re®nement calculations was calculated using a subset of 428 randomly selected re¯ections (5% of the total), which were otherwise excluded from the re®nement. At this point, non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) matrices were derived from the three monomers, and threefold cyclic map averaging was performed with the RAVE package (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994a). The resulting averaged map was of good quality, permitting the addition of all side chains to the poly-Gly/Ala model. Map inspection and rebuilding were performed using O (Jones et al., 1991). Re®nement in X-PLOR continued with simulated annealing. Strict NCS constraints and a bulk-solvent correction were applied, yielding residuals R = 36.2% and Rfree = 40.6%. The Cu atom was added to the single-molecule model. Further re®nement of the positional and temperature para-

meters, using two isotropic B values per residue, reduced the residuals to R = 27.1% and Rfree = 27.9%. A new threefoldaveraged map was calculated and the model was rebuilt to ®t this map. The strict NCS contraints were now replaced by restraints [main-chain atoms: weight = 300, '(B) = 1; side-chain atoms: weight = 200, '(B) = 2]. As the re®nement progressed, electron-density maps revealed signi®cant deviations from NCS at residues 1, 10±12, 24±28, 54, 77±81 and 104±105. The restraints at these residues were relaxed further [weight = 5, '(B) = 5]. The re®nement of positional and temperature parameters as above converged with residuals R = 21.1% and Rfree = 26.2%. In the ®nal rounds of re®nement, cycles of rebuilding and omit-map calculation allowed the less well de®ned regions of electron density to be modelled con®dently and with minimal model bias. Solvent molecules were added at 39 differencedensity peaks exceeding 3'(&), each peak having at least one hydrogen-bonding partner at a geometrically appropriate position. In order to minimize model bias in the Cu±ligand distances, the van der Waals interaction restraints were removed from the ligand residues (His39, Cys89, His92 and Met97) and the Cu atom. A notable feature of the ®nal re®nement cycles was the persistence of three large NCSrelated difference-density peaks, one between each pair of molecules in the trimer. Test re®nements of the B values, in which the peaks were modelled as solvent or metal atoms of various sizes, suggested the presence of metal atoms with about 30 electrons. The peaks could be assigned with high probability as Zn2+ ions, on the grounds that the crystallization buffer had contained 0.2 M Zn2+. The tetrahedral arrangement of the nearest neighbours, which include the side chains of a histidine in one protein molecule and two aspartates in another, supported the assignment. The ®nal model consists of 2418 protein atoms, three Cu atoms, three Zn atoms and 39 ordered solvent molecules; the atomic coordinates were deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). The ®nal values of the residuals are R = 19.9% and Rfree = 25.2% (Table 2). The r.m.s. deviations of the geometry from the Engh & Huber (1991) Ê dictionary are: bonds, 0.009 A; angles, 1.8 ; dihedrals, 27.3 and impropers (C tetrahedral distortion values), 1.8 .

3.1. The structure of P. laminosum plastocyanin
Cyanobacteria

The molecular structure of PlPc is shown in Fig. 1. The polypeptide fold is the same as found, with only minor variations, in all previous structure analyses of plastocyanin from plants, green algae and cyanobacteria (Table 4). The polypeptide forms a -sandwich comprising seven -strands and one irregular strand. The seven -strands are arranged in

two -sheets (sheet 1: strands 2a, 1, 3, 6; sheet 2: strands 4, 7, 8, 2b). The only helical segment in the molecule begins with a turn of 310 helix at the end of strand 4. It continues, after one non-helix residue, with two turns of -helix at the beginning of the irregular strand 5, which is the region of greatest variability among plastocyanin structures. The Cu atom is located near one end of the molecule (the `north' end) and is coordinated by the side chains of two His residues, a Cys and a Met. The coordination geometry is trigonal pyramidal with the Met ligand at the apex. The orientation of the copper site is such that the shortest pathway from the Cu atom to the molecular surface is via the imidazole ring of one of the His ligands (His92 in PlPc, corresponding to His87 in plant plastocyanins). As stated above (see x2.3), the asymmetric unit of PlPc comprises three molecules A, B and C, which are related by a non-crystallographic threefold axis (Fig. 2). Pairwise superpositions of the three molecules reveal no signi®cant differences between the structures (Fig. 3, top three panels). The Ê displacement parameters B are generally high (hBi = 34 A2). When plotted against the residue numbers in molecules A, B and C, the B values exhibit several common trends (Fig. 4). Low B values occur at residues 80±95 (the copper-binding loop between -strands 7 and 8). High values occur in the regions of residues 20±25 (-strand 2), residues 77±80 (the loop between -strands 6 and 7) and residues 101±105 (the Cterminal end of -strand 8).

The coordination is roughly tetrahedral; on spectroscopic grounds it is best described as trigonal pyramidal, with Met97 S in the apical position (Pen®eld et al., 1981).

Between each pair of the PlPc molecules related by the noncrystallographic threefold axis lies a Zn2+ ion (Fig. 2a). Since crystals could not be grown in the absence of Zn2+, it is likely that the formation of trimers was a prerequisite for crystallization. Each Zn2+ ion is coordinated by His61 N42 from one PlPc molecule and by Asp44 O2 and Asp45 O1 from another. These ligating atoms lie at three corners of a tetrahedron. For the Zn2+ ions between molecules A and B and molecules B and C, a solvent atom in the fourth coordination position was clearly identi®ed in electron-density maps. Similar interstitial Zn2+ ions, coordinated by Asp/Glu and His side chains of two protein molecules, have been reported in the structure of another `blue' Cu protein, Pseudomonas putida azurin (Chen et al., 1998), as well as the structure of Rhodobacter capsulatus

cytochrome cH (Tahirov et al. 1997). In the latter case, as in the present work, the Zn2+ ions were essential for crystallization.
3.4. Comparisons between PlPc and plant plastocyanins

P. laminosum plastocyanin has 105 amino-acid residues (Varley et al., 1995), whereas the plastocyanins of higher plants and green algae have 97±99. In a structure-based alignment with a 99-residue plant plastocyanin (Fig. 5), two of the additional residues occur at the N-terminus, three at positions 78±80 and one at the C-terminus. The extensions at the N- and C-termini do not affect the polypeptide fold, and the additional residues at positions 78±80 merely add a hairpin bend to a loop at the the end of the molecule remote from the copper site (the `south' end). However, there are two further differences between the structures of PlPc and plant plastocyanins: in PlPc, ®ve residues at positions 51±55 replace a group of three residues in the plant plastocyanins, and one residue at position 62 replaces another group of three residues. These differences leave the total number of residues unchanged, but they are associated with a substantial structural rearrangement in the irregular ®fth strand of the polypeptide. The two additional residues at 51±55 in PlPc are part of an additional turn of helix at residues 52±56, while the shortening of the polypeptide at residue 62 removes a bulge which occurs at residues 58±60 in plant plastocyanins. From a functional point of view, the most important difference between PlPc and plant plastocyanins is that at neutral pH the PlPc molecule has a total charge of À3, compared with charges of À7 to À9 on plant plastocyanin molecules (including in each case +2 for the Cu atom and À1 for the copper-binding Cys). The difference between the charges is largely localized in the region of the `acidic patch', which in plant plastocyanins occurs at residues 42±45 and 59± 61. In PlPc the residues corresponding to the ®rst of these two groups are Asp44±Asp45±Lys46±Gln47 and the residues corresponding to the second group are Ser62±Gln63 (Fig. 6).

Thus, the two groups of acidic residues, which have attracted attention because they surround the invariant residue Tyr83 in plant plastocyanins, are missing in PlPc. Instead, the region around the invariant Tyr (Tyr88 in PlPc) has an overall basic character, to which Lys53 and Arg93 also contribute (Fig. 6). While the role of the invariant Tyr in physiological electron transfer is still uncertain, the presence of a basic region on the PlPc molecule is consistent with the observation that PlPc, when it reacts with the cytochrome b6f complex, behaves as though it has a small net positive local charge (Wagner et al., 1996).
3.5. Comparisons between PlPc and other cyanobacterial plastocyanins

Two cyanobacterial plastocyanins have previously been characterized structurally: A. variabilis plastocyanin (AvPc) and Synechocystis plastocyanin (SyPc) (Table 4). A structurebased alignment of the sequences of PlPc, AvPc and SyPc is included in Fig. 5. The sequence of SyPc is seven residues shorter than the other two sequences, with two residues instead of ®ve at positions 47±51, three residues missing between positions 78±82 and one residue missing at the C-terminus. A detailed analysis of the structural consequences of these sequence differences is in preparation (Fields et al., 1999). Owing to the inclusion of additional structural information, the present alignment of SyPc with AvPc differs slightly from earlier proposals (Navarro et al., 1997; Romero et al., 1998). Fig. 3 (bottom two panels) shows the differences between the positions of corresponding C atoms when PlPc is superposed in turn with AvPc and SyPc. The differences between corresponding C atomic positions are generally small, except

The sequence shown for SyPc is that of the native protein (Briggs et al., 1990); the coordinates used to align this sequence with the others were taken from the structure of a SyPc triple mutant (Protein Data Bank entry 1PCS). The sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW (Thompson et al., 1994). Figure produced using ALSCRIPT (Barton, 1993).

at residues 23±26 (the -turn between strands 2 and 3), 44±46 (a -turn near the end of strand 4), 60 (end of helical segment in strand 5) and 79±81 (the -hairpin bend between strands 6 and 7). A close similarity between the structures of PlPc and Ê AvPc (r.m.s. difference = 1.1 A) is to be expected in view of the high level of sequence identity (66%). The differences between PlPC and AvPc at residues 44±46 and 60 can be attributed to the presence of the Zn2+-binding site at residues 44, 45 and 61 in PlPc. The large differences at residues 23±26 and 79±81 are associated with high displacement parameters in PlPc (Fig. 4), suggesting that these loops are disordered or ¯exible and hence determined with lower accuracy. the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (UK) for a Research Studentship.

4. Conclusions
The structure of P. laminosum plastocyanin is closely similar to those of the plastocyanins from two other cyanobacteria, Anabaena variabilis and (with allowance for differences in the number of amino-acid residues) Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (A42D/D47P/A63L triple mutant). The absence of a concentration of negative surface charges corresponding to the acidic patch of plant plastocyanins is con®rmed. The location and coordination of interstitial Zn2+ ions in PlPc crystals are consistent with the grouping of the protein molecules around a non-crystallographic threefold axis and explain why Zn2+ ions appear to be essential for crystallization.

Figure 6

The surface residues near Tyr88 in P. laminosum plastocyanin are predominantly non-acidic. The sequences Asp44±Asp45±Lys46±Gln47 and Ser62±Gln63 correspond to the conserved negative patch formed by residues 42±45 and 59±61 in plant plastocyanins. The basic character of the surface near Tyr88 is enhanced by Lys53 and Arg93.
