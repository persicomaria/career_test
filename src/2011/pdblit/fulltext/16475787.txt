ABSTRACT: Prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) formed from arachidonic acid is an unstable intermediate and is efficiently converted into more stable arachidonate metabolites by the action of enzymes. Prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS) has dual catalytic activities: formation of PGF2R from PGH2 by the PGH2 9,11endoperoxide reductase activity and 9R,11 -PGF2 (PGF2R ) from PGD2 by the PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity in the presence of NADPH. Bimatoprost (BMP), which is a highly effective ocular hypotensive agent, is a PGF2R analogue that inhibits both the PGD2 11-ketoreductase and PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase activities of PGFS. To examine the catalytic mechanism of PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase, a crystal structure of PGFS[NADPH + BMP] has been determined at 2.0 Å resolution. BMP binds near the PGD2 binding site, but the R- and -chains of BMP are locate on the - and R-chains of PGD2, respectively. Consequently, the bound BMP and PGD2 direct their opposite faces of the cyclopentane moieties toward the nicotinamide ring of the bound NADP. The R- and -chains of BMP are involved in H-bonding with protein residues, while the cyclopentane moiety is surrounded by water molecules and is not directly attached to either the protein or the bound NADPH, indicating that the cyclopentane moiety is movable in the active site. From the complex structure, two model structures of PGFS containing PGF2R and PGH2 were built. On the basis of the model structures and inhibition data, a putative catalytic mechanism of PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase of PGFS is proposed. Formation of PGF2R from PGH2 most likely involves a direct hydride transfer from the bound NADPH to the endoperoxide of PGH2 without the participation of specific amino acid residues.

of mammals (1-7) and exhibits a variety of biological activities, including contraction of pulmonary arteries (811). PGF2R is mainly synthesized directly from PGH2 by PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase (12-15). A small amount of PGF2R is also produced from PGE2 by PGE2 9-ketoreductase (16, 17). A PGF2R epimer has been reported to

exhibit various biological activities (18-21), and its levels are increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and urine in patients with mastocytosis (18) and bronchial asthma (22-24). PGF2R is synthesized from PGD2 by PGD2 11ketoreductase (25, 26). PGF synthase (PGFS) was first purified from bovine lung (15, 27). PGFS has dual functions; it catalyzes the formation of PGF2R from PGH2 by PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase in the presence of NADPH and also catalyzes the formation of PGF2R from PGD2 by PGD2 11-ketoreductase (28). However, this enzyme does not catalyze the reduction of PGE2 (15) (Chart 1). Interestingly, this enzyme exhibits reductase activities toward various carbonyl compounds, such as 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ), p-nitrobenzaldehyde, and p-nitroacetophenone (15). Although the PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity is competitively inhibited by PQ, the PGH2 9,11endoperoxide reductase activity is not inhibited by PQ, suggesting that the PGD2 and PGH2 binding sites are different (15). PGFS belongs to the aldo-keto reductase family on the basis of its substrate specificity, molecular weight, and amino acid sequence (29, 30). Human 3R-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoforms have been systematically named AKR1C1AKR1C4, and PGFS, 3R-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, is named AKR1C3 (31). We proposed a catalytic mechanism for the PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity of PGFS on the basis of complex structures of PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2] and PGFS[NADPH + rutin] (32), which is similar to the basic mechanism of the aldo-keto reductase family (33). Our mechanism uses the catalytic triad (D50,,,K84,,,Y55 H-bonding) instead of the catalytic tetrad (D50,,,K84,,, Y55,,,H117 H-bonding) for donation of a proton from Y55 to PGD2 (33). Also, in our mechanism, H117 might act as a general acid at a low pH to donate a proton to PGD2. Recent reports suggest that the PGFS activity is high in gastrointestinal tumors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) protect against the progression of gastrointestinal tumors (34-40). There is a growing body of

evidence which shows that NSAIDs may also protect against a variety of other cancers, including prostate carcinoma and, most recently, leukemia (34-40). For example, treatment of leukemia HL-60 cell line cells with indomethacin (IMN) inhibits the growth of HL-60 cells, and overexpression of PGFS in myeloid cells promotes proliferation, suggesting that IMN inhibits PGFS (41-43). Indeed, a crystal structure of PGFS containing IMN has been determined (44). PGFS is inhibited by NSAIDs such as Suprofen (IC50 ) 0.6 µM), Flurbirofen (IC50 ) 0.8 µM), Ketoprofen (IC50 ) 3.8 µM), and IMN (IC50 ) 4.1 µM) (45), and these NSAIDs have preventive activity against the progression of gastrointestinal tumors. Therefore, specific inhibitors of PGFS might be important anticancer drugs. Recently, it has become apparent that there are neutral lipids of several existing fatty acids (46-55). These neutral lipids occur in the form of an amide, ether, or ester, which replaces the invariant carboxylic acid moiety. Anandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol are examples of neutral lipids that are substrates for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The resultant products are prostaglandin amides (prostamides) or glyceryl esters (49, 51). Reduction of prostamide produces biologically active prostamide F2R. Bimatoprost (BMP) is a synthetic structural analogue of PGF2R in which the charged carboxylic acid group is replaced with a neutral ethylamide substituent.

Structurally, BMP is therefore a prostaglandin amide or prostamide and exhibits biological activity similar to that of prostamide F2R (56, 57). BMP is of particular interest because it is clinically the most efficacious ocular hypotensive agent reported to date, its activity exceeding that of both timolol and latanoprost (58, 59). The ocular hypotensive activity has been suggested to be due to enzymatic hydrolysis to a free acid metabolite that would behave as an authentic prostanoid FP receptor agonist (60), but this is controversial (61). Also, BMP in-

hibits formation of PGF2R from PGH2 (IC50 ) 6 µM) and formation of PGF2R from PGD2 (IC50 ) 5 µM) by PGFS (62). Here we describe crystal structures of a human lung PGFS ternary complex, PGFS[NADPH + BMP]. On the basis of the structure, we propose a catalytic mechanism for formation of PGF2R from PGH2 by PGFS. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Crystallization. Recombinant human lung PGFS was purified from Escherichia coli HB101 containing a pUChLuFS plasmid encoding the human lung PGFS sequence. The enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using methods previously described (63). The hanging drop method of vapor diffusion was employed for crystallization of the enzymes. BMP was dissolved in 95% ethanol and added to the crystallization solution just before the crystallization was set up. Thick plate-shaped crystals of PGFS[NADPH + BMP] suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were grown in a solution containing 1.0 mM BMP, 1.0 mM NADPH, 0.14 M NaCl, 50 mM MES buffer (pH 7.0), and 26% (w/v) PEG 8000 with a protein concentration of 7 mg/ mL at 4 °C. The crystals were grown for 14 days. Data Measurement. The crystal (0.3 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.1 mm) of PGFS[NADPH + BMP] in a hanging drop was scooped with a nylon loop and dipped into a cryoprotectant solution for 10-15 min, before it was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cryoprotectant solution was composed of the original mother liquor containing 18% ethylene glycol. The frozen crystal was transferred onto a Rigaku RAXIS IIc imaging plate X-ray diffractometer with a rotating anode X-ray generator as an X-ray source (Cu KR radiation at 50 kV and 100 mA). The X-ray beam was focused to 0.3 mm by confocal optics (Osmic, Inc.). The diffraction data were measured up to 2.0 Å resolution at -180 °C. The data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (64). The statistics are given in Table 1. Crystal Structure Determination. The unit cell dimensions and space group of the PGFS[NADPH + BMP] crystal indi-

cate that the crystal structure is not isomorphous to that of PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2]. The crystal structure of the PGFS[NADPH + BMP] complex was determined by a molecular replacement procedure using the PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2] structure. The protein structure with the bound NADPH was refined by the simulated annealing procedures of X-PLOR (65). The 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps exhibited a large significant residual electron density peak in the active site (Figure 1). A BMP molecule was built into the residual electron density peak. Other well-defined residual peaks were assigned to water molecules. The complex structure and water molecules were refined with all data (no  cutoff) at 2.0 Å resolution. Site-Directed Mutagenesis. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare cDNAs encoding the mutated Y55F form of the enzyme (30). Mutagenic oligonucleotides was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel et al. (66), with a Mutan-K site-directed mutagenesis kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). A clone containing the Y55F mutation was identified by nucleotide sequence analysis across the mutation site by the dideoxy chain termination method (67). PGD2 11-Ketoreductase ActiVity (PGD2 f PGF2R ) Assay. The PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity and the PGH2 9,11endoperoxide reductase activity of the Y55F mutated enzyme were measured as described previously (15). The standard reaction mixture that contains 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 500 µM NADPH, and 1.5 mM [3H]PGD2 (0.14 µCi) was prepared. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 µL of the enzyme (1 mg/mL) to 90 µL of the standard reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Blanks contained the reaction mixture without the enzyme. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 250 µL of a cold diethyl ether/methanol/200 mM citric acid mixture (30:4:1), and PGs were extracted into the organic phase. The mixture of PGD2 and PGF2R (20 µg each) was added to the solution as authentic markers. The organic phase (150 µL) was subjected to thin-layer chromatography in a diethyl ether/methanol/acetic acid solvent system (90:2:0.1). The positions of the PGs on the silica gel plate were visualized with iodine vapor. Silica gel was scraped off in sections corresponding to PGD2, PGF2R , and others, and the radioactivity of each section was measured by a liquid scintillation spectrometer in a toluene solution containing 0.01% 1,4-bis[2-(4-methyl-5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene and 0.5% 2,5-diphenyloxazole.

PGH2 9,11-Endoperoxide Reductase ActiVity (PGH2 f PGF2R) Assay. The PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase activity was assayed under the same conditions that were used for the PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity except that 80 µM [1-14C]PGH2 (0.1 µCi) was used as a substrate in place of 1.5 mM [3H]PGD2 and that the incubation time was 1 min at 30 °C. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OVerall Structure. The crystallographic refinement parameters (Table 1), final 2Fo - Fc maps, and conformational analysis by PROCHECK (68) indicate that the crystal structure of the PGFS[NADPH + BMP] complex has been determined with acceptable statistics. As shown in Figure 2, the protein structure of PGFS displays the characteristic fold of the AKR superfamily (69), an (R/ )8 barrel with three associated large loops. The -strands ( 1- 8) form the cylindrical core of the barrel and are surrounded by R-helices (R1-R8), while the accompanying loops (loop 4, loop 7, and loop 9) partially cover the C-terminal end of the barrel. In addition to the (R/ )8 core structure, there are two -strands (B1 and B2) from the N-terminus sealing the N-terminal end of the barrel and two R-helices (H1 and H2) from the C-terminal part of the molecule packed by the side

of the barrel. These additional -strands and R-helices are conserved in other AKR structures (69). Cofactor (NADPH) binds in a deep cavity at the Cterminal end of the barrel and extends across the barrel closer to the core. The bound NADPH is heavily involved in H-bonds with amino acid residues in the loops connecting -strands and R-helices. The nicotinamide moiety is located within the enzyme near the center of the barrel, while the adenine moiety is exposed on the outer surface of the protein. BMP in the ActiVe Site. As shown in Figure 3, a BMP molecule is located above the bound NADPH and is surrounded by loop 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9. Although the two hydroxyl groups (O9 and O11) of the cyclopentane moiety are pointed to the nicotinamide ring of the bound NADPH, there is no significant interaction between them. Each of the O9 and O11 hydroxyl groups of the cyclopentane moiety is involved in two H-bonds with two water molecules (w2 and w3, and w4 and w5, respectively). The ethylamide R-chain is deep within the active site cavity, while the phenyl -chain is located above the R-chain. O1 and N1 in the R-chain participate in H-bonds with OG of S118 and w1, respectively. Although OH of Y319 can be near N1 to form a H-bond, there is no H-bond between them because of the presence of the ethyl moiety. The hydroxyl group O15 in the -chain

participates in a H-bond with OG of S129 and w4. Therefore, the polar groups of R- and -chains (tails) are directly connected to the protein with H-bonds, while the cyclopentane moiety (head) is associated with water molecules, suggesting that the cyclopentane moiety is movable in the active site cavity. Although the polar groups of BMP are involved in H-bonds, BMP is bound to the protein by mainly hydrophobic interactions. There are seven aromatic residues (Y24, W86, F139, W227, F306, F311, and Y319) surrounding the bound BMP. W227 is located over the cyclopentane moiety of BMP as if it seals the bound BMP into the active site cavity. Since BMP is an analogue of PGF2R, a PGF2R molecule can be completely superimposed on the bound BMP and forms the same H-bonds that were observed for BMP, except that O1 of the carboxyl group forms a H-bond with OH of Y319 and water (w1). This modeling suggests that the product PGF2R from PGH2 might bind to the same site as BMP before being released from the active site cavity. An inhibition study supports this conclusion because BMP inhibits the 9,11endoperoxide reductase activity as well as the 11-ketoreductase activity of PGFS (62). A Comparison of the PGD2 and BMP Binding Sites. Although the crystal structure of PGFS[NADPH + BMP] is not isomorphous to that of PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2], the peptide fold is identical within experimental error. Significant

movements are only observed in the side chains of W227 and F311. These aromatic residues are two of seven residues surrounding BMP, suggesting that the PGFS structure is relatively rigid. The NADP+ and NADPH binding sites in the PGFS structure are the same within experimental error (rmsd ) 0.22 Å), and their H-bonding networks are also the same. Although PGD2 and BMP bind to a similar site, there are several significant differences between their binding schemes. The R- and -chains of BMP are located on the - and R-chains of PGD2, respectively, indicating that the BMP and PGD2 binding schemes are flipped. The bound BMP and PGD2 direct their opposite faces of the cyclopentane moieties toward the nicotinamide ring of the bound NADP (Figure 4). PGFS has an oxyanion hole in the active site. In the PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2] structure, the carbonyl oxygen (O11) of PGD2 is pulled into the oxyanion hole and forms H-bonds with OH of Y55 and NE2 of H117. On the other hand, no part of BMP is near the oxyanion hole in the PGFS[NADPH + BMP] structure. A water (w6) is located in the oxyanion hole and forms H-bonds with Y55 and H117. Consequently, the positions of the cyclopentane moieties of BMP and PGD2 are significantly different, suggesting that the catalytic sites of 11-ketoreductase and 9,11-endoperoxide reductase in PGFS are in different locations in the active site cavity.

However, the bound BMP and PGD2 direct their opposite faces of the cyclopentane moieties toward the nicotinamide ring of the bound NADP. O11 of PGD2 which is in an oxyanion hole is depicted as a larger red sphere. Thin lines denote possible H-bonds between BMP and PGFS. Direct hydride transfer that would occur between C11 of PGD2 and C4 of NADP+ is shown as a thin line.

FIGURE 5: Model structure of PGFS[NADPH + PGH2] built based on the PGFS[NADPH + BMP] structure. The bound BMP is converted to PGF2R by replacing the ethyl amide group with oxygen and modifying the phenyl group to the tail of the -chain. PGH2 (magenta) is built from the resultant PGF2R by forming the endoperoxide. A swinging model (yellow) is built as follows. The cyclopentane moiety is swung toward the bound NADPH so that O9 is sufficiently close to receive the pro-R hydrogen from C4 of NADPH. Although the R- and -chains were moved slightly, all H-bonds between PGH2 and PGFS remained.

A Possible Catalytic Mechanism. BMP inhibits the PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity as well as the PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase activity (62). From the crystal structures of PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2] and PGFS[NADPH + BMP], the PGD2 11-ketoreductase inhibitory activity of BMP is quite obvious because the two molecules bind to a similar region in the active site cavity. Since BMP is a PGF2R analogue and also inhibits the PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase reaction, it is reasonable to assume that PGH2 and PGF2R bind to the BMP binding site. On the basis of this assumption, we can build a model structure of PGFS[NADP+ + PGF2R] from PGFS[NADPH + BMP] and another model structure of PGFS[NADPH + PGH2] by forming the endoperoxide between O9 and O11 (Figure 5). The endoperoxide moiety of PGH2 in the model structure is too distant to transfer a hydride directly from the bound NADPH. In PGFS[NADPH + BMP], the cyclopentane moiety of BMP is surrounded by water molecules (w2-w5) and does not directly attach to the protein through H-bonding, suggesting that the cyclopentane moiety is movable in the active site cavity. As shown in Figure 5, the cyclopentane moiety of BMP can be moved toward the bound NADPH without breaking the H-bonds between the chains of PGH2 and the protein. In this model structure, O9 of PGH2 is brought near the bound NADPH and is able to receive the pro-R hydrogen from the bound NADPH.

On the basis of these two PGFS[NADPH + PGH2] model structures, we propose a putative catalytic mechanism for the PGH2 f PGF2R reaction. PGH2 binds at the BMP binding site found in the crystal structure (model 1, colored magenta in Figure 5), and the cyclopentane-endoperoxide moiety swings toward the bound NADPH (model 2, colored yellow in Figure 5) without breaking the H-bonds of the R- and -chains. In this geometry, O9 of PGH2 can be located within 3.5 Å of C4 of NADPH, the pro-R hydrogen of NADPH can be directly transferred to O9 of PGH2, and the O9-O11 bond is broken in a concerted fashion (Figure 6A). The negatively charged O11 receives a proton from the solution to complete the reaction, and the resulting PGF2R is released from the active site cavity. The proposed catalysis occurs only if the endoperoxide moiety of PGH2 is oriented correctly relative to the bound NADPH, whose location and orientation did not vary in the three crystal structures (PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2], PGFS[NADPH + rutin], and PGFS[NADPH + BMP]). Obviously, the proposed mechanism for formation of PGF2R from PGH2 is different from that of formation of PGF2R from PGD2 proposed on the basis of PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2] and PGFS[NADPH + rutin] structures (32). In PGF2R formation, a PGD2 binds to the active site, carbonyl oxygen O11 is in the oxyanion hole, and the carbonyl carbon (C11) directs its re face toward the nicotinamide ring of the

A PGH2 binds to the active site, and the polar groups of the R- and -chains form H-bonds with PGFS. O9 of the cyclopentane moiety is brought near the bound NADPH by a swinging motion and receives directly the pro-R hydrogen from NADPH. The O9-O11 bond is broken in a concerted fashion. The negatively charged O11 receives a proton from the solution to complete the reaction, and a PGF2R is formed. (B) PGD2 11-ketoreductase. A PGD2 binds to the active site; carbonyl oxygen O11 is in the oxyanion hole, and the carbonyl carbon (C11) directs its re-face toward the nicotinamide ring of the bound NADPH.

bound NADPH. Y55 (or H119) donates a proton to O11 of PGD2, and the pro-R hydrogen of NADPH is transferred directly to C11 of PGD2 to form PGF2R (Figure 6B). Y55 is the essential amino acid residue for the PGD2 11ketoreductase activity, while it does not participate in the proposed PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase activity. Therefore, the Y55F mutated enzyme was prepared, and the PGD2 11-ketoreductase and PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase activities were measured. The Y55F mutated enzyme loses the PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity but retains the PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase activity, indicating that the formation of PGF2R from PGD2 and the formation of PGF2R from PGH2 utilize the different catalytic mechanism. Since no specific amino acid residue directly facilitates the hydride transfer in the proposed catalytic mechanism of PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase, the hydride transfer rate would be slower than that of the PGD2 11-ketoreductase reaction facilitated by a general acid catalysis. Indeed, the catalytic rate (kcat ) 5.7 × 10-3 s-1) and efficiency (kcat/KM ) 2.28 × 102 M-1 s-1) of PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase are lower than those of PGD2 11-ketoreductase (kcat ) 1.42 × 10-2 s-1, kcat/KM ) 9.47 × 103 M-1 s-1) (30). PGF2R Binding Site and Mode. The proposed catalytic mechanism assumes that PGF2R binds to the BMP binding

site in the same binding mode which is different (flipped mode) from that of PGD2 found in the crystal structure of PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2]. It is possible that the bulky ethylamide and phenyl groups at the R- and -chains, respectively, might prevent the cyclopentane moiety of BMP from entering deeply into the active site cavity as observed in PGD2 binding and induce BMP to have a mode flipped compared to the PGD2 binding mode. To examine this possibility, the following three model structures were built: (1) BMP bound to the BMP binding site in the same mode as PGD2, (2) BMP bound to the PGD2 binding site in the same mode as PGD2, and (3) BMP bound to the PGD2 binding site in the same mode as BMP (flipped mode). Model 1 was built by flipping the bound BMP, and the conformations of R- and -chains were varied to superimpose the R- and -chains on the - and R-chains of the bound BMP, respectively. Note that O11 is far from the oxyanion hole (the bound water w6 position). Models 2 and 3 were built by placing O11 and O9 of BMP, respectively, in the oxyanion hole; each BMP model structure was rotated at O11 or O9, and the conformations of R- and -chains were varied to superimpose them on the bound PGD2 in the PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2] structure. Since the active site cavity of PGFS is relatively large, BMP fits well in the active site

1994 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 7, 2006 cavity in the three model structures without short contacts. Thus, the modeling studies suggest that the BMP binding site and mode found in the PGFS[NADPH + BMP] structure would not be due to the bulky groups attached to the R- and -chains. Since BMP and PGF2R are structurally very similar, PGF2R could bind to PGFS in a manner similar to that of BMP in the model structures; i.e., it could bind to two different sites (PGD2 and BMP binding sites) in two different binding modes (PGD2 and flipped modes). However, PGFS does not catalyze the reduction reaction from PGD2 to PGF2R or from PGE2 to PGF2R (28). Both PGD2 and PGE2 are structurally quite similar and have a carbonyl group. One of the characteristic structural features of PGFS is the presence of an oxyanion hole in the active site of 11-ketoreductase. The carbonyl oxygen (O11) of PGD2 is placed in the oxyanion hole in the PGFS[NADP+ + PGD2] structure, and thus, the carbonyl group is reduced to a hydroxyl group to produce 9R,11 -PGF2 (PGF2R ) but not 9R,11R-PGF2 (PGF2R). On the other hand, if PGE2 were to bind to the PGD2 binding site in the flipped mode to place carbonyl O9 in the oxyanion hole, the carbonyl group (C9dO9) would be reduced to PGF2R. However, PGE2 is not reduced to PGF2R by PGFS, indicating that PGE2 and PGF2R do not bind to the PGD2 binding site in the flipped mode. Therefore, the catalytic activity of PGFS indicates that the "real" PGF2R binding site must be shifted from the PGD2 binding site (i.e., O9 or O11 is not in the oxyanion hole) and thus eliminates the model 2 and 3 structures. Although the cyclopentane moiety of BMP (PGF2R) in model 1 is shifted from that of PGD2, O9 and O11 are not pointed toward the nicotinamide ring of the bound NADPH, suggesting that the model 1 structure is not suitable for PGF2R production. Since the BMP binding site found in the PGFS[NADPH + BMP] structure is shifted from that of PGD2 but O9 is near C4 of the nicotinamide ring of the bound NADPH, it is reasonable to conclude that PGF2R and BMP bind to the same site in the same mode (flipped mode).
