ABSTRACT: Guanine or hypoxanthine, physiological corepressors of the Escherichia coli purine repressor (PurR), promote formation of the ternary PurR-corepressor-operator DNA complex that functions to repress pur operon gene expression. Structure-based predictions on the importance of Arg190 in determining 6-oxopurine specificity and corepressor binding affinity were tested by mutagenesis, analysis of in vivo function, and in vitro corepressor binding measurements. Replacements of Arg190 with Ala or Gln resulted in functional repressors in which binding of guanine and hypoxanthine was retained but specificity was relaxed to permit binding of adenine. X-ray structures were determined for ternary complexes of mutant repressors with purines (adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and 6-methylpurine) and operator DNA. These structures indicate that R190A binds guanine, hypoxanthine, and adenine with nearly equal, albeit reduced, affinity in large part because of a newly made compensatory hydrogen bond between the rotated hydroxyl side chain of Ser124 and the exocyclic 6 positions of the purines. Through direct and water-mediated contacts, the R190Q protein binds adenine with a nearly 75-fold higher affinity than the wild type repressor while maintaining wild type affinity for guanine and hypoxanthine. The results establish at the atomic level the basis for the critical role of Arg190 in the recognition of the exocyclic 6 position of its purine corepressors and the successful redesign of corepressor specificity.

The Escherichia coli purine repressor (PurR) binds to a conserved 16 bp operator sequence and regulates transcription of multiple pur regulon genes, including nine operons for de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, the purR gene, and other genes with functions related to nucleotide metabolism (1). PurR is a 341-amino acid residue polypeptide that functions as a dimer. Each subunit is composed of an NH2-terminal DNA binding domain (residues 1-60) and a larger COOH-terminal corepressor binding and dimerization domain (residues 61-341), termed the CBD. Binding of a corepressor, hypoxanthine or guanine, increases the operator DNA binding affinity. Consequently, PurR is the primary regulatory protein that coordinates expression of pur regulon genes to the availability of purines in E. coli. In addition,

purF-encoded glutamine PRPP amidotransferase, the first enzyme of the pathway for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis, is subject to feedback regulation by purine nucleotides. The X-ray structures have been determined for a PurRhypoxanthine-purF operator complex (2) as well as the ligand-free PurR CBD dimer (3). The CBD consists of NH2 and COOH subdomains which have very similar R/ topologies. Residues at the interface of the two subdomains and from two of the three crossover strands that connect the subdomains form the corepressor binding pocket. The structures of the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex and the corepressor-free CBD also identified key elements of the protein involved in DNA binding and have suggested the allosteric mechanism by which corepressor binding mediates specific binding to DNA (3). Upon binding corepressor, structural changes that include hinge-bending rotations of at least 17° between the NH2 and COOH subdomains of each monomer result in the "closed" CBD conformation. These rotations were deduced to position the DNA-binding domains of each PurR monomer such that in the presence of operator DNA, the hinge region, residues 48-56, can undergo a coil to helix transition. Once formed, the hinge helix interacts specifically with the minor groove and causes the DNA to be kinked by greater than 50°. The 2-fold related helix-turn-helix motifs of PurR are then able to make a series of base-specific contacts in the DNA major

groove (2). Thus, PurR function requires a minimum of five steps: (i) corepressor binding, and (ii) a CBD structural transition that is (iii) transduced to the DNA binding domain, resulting in (iv) DNA binding and (v) inhibition of transcription. Analysis of the corepressor binding pocket of the PurR implicated residue Arg190 as a key specificity determinant of PurR for 6-oxopurines (2). Specifically, the guanidinium group of this residue was found to donate two hydrogen bonds to the two lone pair acceptors of the O6 atom of hypoxanthine. Such hydrogen bond complementarity should preclude PurR binding to any purine that has hydrogen bond donor groups at this position, e.g., adenine. In addition to its proposed role in corepressor discrimination, the Arg190 guanidinium group is involved in a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the N1. Although not a corepressor-discriminating interaction, this water-mediated hydrogen bond likely contributes to the overall binding affinity. In this report, we describe the structure-based design and analysis of two mutant PurR proteins in which residue Arg190 is substituted by alanine or glutamine. To study the function of mutations in vivo, we used conditionally replicative, integrative plasmids to incorporate purR into the chromosome in single copy. Next, we purified the mutant proteins to assess their corepressor and DNA binding activities. Finally, we describe seven crystal structures of mutant PurR-corepressor-purF operator complexes in which Arg190 has been replaced by either alanine (R190A) or glutamine (R190Q). Replacement of Arg190 by alanine or by glutamine expanded the corepressor specificity of PurR to include adenine as well as guanine and hypoxanthine and, in the case of the R190A mutant, 6-methylpurine. The structures of R190A bound to hypoxanthine, guanine, adenine, or 6-methylpurine reveal the structural and chemical features that allow these purines, which differ at their exocyclic 6 position, to bind the repressor with nearly equal, albeit lowered, affinity. The structures of R190Q bound to hypoxanthine, guanine, or adenine clarify the stereochemical details of the direct and water-mediated interactions which this protein utilizes to bind the natural corepressors with undiminished affinity and adenine with only a 6-16-fold lower affinity than hypoxanthine and guanine, respectively. Combined, the in vivo, in vitro, and structural data demonstrate that Arg190 is the key recognition determinant of PurR for 6-oxopurine corepressors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and Plasmids. E. coli strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1. Plasmid pCAH64 (Figure 1A) is a choramphenicol-resistant, oriRR6K, attP plasmid that was derived from pSK49uidA2 (4). These plasmids are conditionally replicative because they have the  replication origin of R6K (denoted oriRR6K). Hence, they require the trans-acting  protein, the pir gene product, to replicate as a plasmid. An oriRR6K plasmid replicates at an intermediate or high copy number, ca. 15 or 250 copies per cell, in a strain with pir+ or pir-116, respectively, on the chromosome (5). All pir-dependent plasmids were propagated in the pir+ host BW23473 or the pir-116 host BW23474 (4). These plasmids are integrative because they carry attP from phage . In a standard non-pir strain, an oriRR6K, attP plasmid cannot replicate. Rather, it integrates into the chromosome

Redesign of Corepressor Specificity of PurR in single copy by site-specific recombination when  integrase (int) is supplied in trans (4, 6). In pCAH64, purR is transcribed from a weak synthetic promoter denoted Psyn1 that originated from pHH7013 (from J. Hu). The promoter region, ribosome binding site, and translation start site are shown in Figure 1B. The purR wild type and mutant genes were subcloned into a precursor plasmid pCAH63 as NdeI/ BamHI fragments, thus yielding pCAH64. Similar plasmid constructs in which purR was expressed from Ptac instead of Psyn1 were toxic, presumably due to high expression of purR (7). For construction of strain FL100, the purF-lacZ(kan)TX773 transcriptional fusion (from TX773) (8) was crossed into purR strain R220 by selecting KanR transductants (9). The resulting strain FL100 was transformed with pINT-ts (6) to provide integration function. pINT-ts is an ampicillinresistant, low-copy plasmid with a temperature-sensitive replication origin; pINT-ts expresses int under control of the cI-repressible Pr promoter and encodes the temperaturesensitive cI857 repressor. Plasmid Integration. Plasmids were integrated into the chromosomal attB site in strain FL100 using pINT-ts (4). The int gene in pINT-ts is expressed at temperatures above 37 °C; the plasmid is also temperature-sensitive for replication (5). Thus, incubation of pINT-ts transformants at 43 °C simultaneously induces int synthesis and blocks plasmid replication. Accordingly, an ampicillin-resistant transformant of FL100 carrying pINT-ts was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) at 30 °C and transformed with a pCAH64purR plasmid. The mixture was incubated at 43 °C for 30 min and at 37 °C for 1 h, then spread onto LB agar containing chloramphenicol (6 µg/mL), and incubated at 37 °C. Several CmR colonies were purified on LB agar (without chloramphenicol), screened for ampicillinsensitive ones, to verify loss of pINT-ts, and then tested by PCR for plasmid copy number. Once constructed, integrants were routinely grown in the absence of antibiotic selection. A pCAH64 plasmid integrant lacking purR was used as a negative control. PCR Testing for Copy Number. Two primers specific for the vector attP (P2 and P3) and two specific for the chromosomal attB region (P1 and P4) were used to test integrants for those with a single copy of the integrated plasmid (Figure 2), as described (4). Primers P1 (GAAGGACGTTGATCGGGCGGGG), P2 (CAGTGACACAGGAACACTTAACG), P3 (CACGATAATATCCGGGTAGG), and P4 (GGCGCAATGCCATCTGGTATCAC) were obtained from IDT, Inc. (Coralville, IA). These primers were designed so that a non-integrant yielded a 231 bp PCR fragment with P1 and P4 (attB pair) and a single-copy integrant gave a 327 bp PCR fragment with P1 and P2 (attL pair) and a 592 bp PCR fragment with P3 and P4 (attR pair). Double or higher multiple integrants gave the 327 and 592 bp PCR fragments and an additional 698 bp PCR fragment with P2 and P3 (attP pair). These fragment sizes were verified when non-integrant, single-integrant, and double or multiple-integrant control strains were tested. PCR was performed directly using bacterial colonies as described (10). Cells were picked with a glass capillary into 20 µL of lysis solution [1× PCR buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) containing 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/mL nuclease-free BSA, 0.05 mg/mL Proteinase K, 20 mM dithiothreitol, and

1.8 µM sodium dodecyl sulfate]. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, after which they were heated to 90 °C for 5 min. Five microliters of lysed cells, 50 pmol of each primer (P1-P4) and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) were combined with 1× PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at 200 µM in a final volume of 100 µL. PCR was carried out for 25 cycles (denaturing for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 63 °C, and extending for 1 min at 72 °C). Assay for Repression by purR. FL100 purR integrants were cultured overnight at 37 °C in minimal medium (11) containing 15 µg/mL chloramphenicol. Then, 100 µL of the fresh overnight culture was used to inoculate 5 mL of the same medium in a 1.5 cm × 12 cm tube. The cells were grown with shaking at 37 °C until reaching mid-log phase. The -galactosidase activity was assayed in permeabilized cells according to the method of Miller (12). Site-Directed Mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis by the procedure of Kunkel et al. (13) was carried out as described previously (14). Single-stranded purR template DNA was prepared from plasmid pPR1005-2 (11). OVerexpression and Purification of PurR. Wild type and mutant purR genes in pPR1005-2 were transferred via flanking NdeI and HindIII sites to pET24(a) for overexpression. In this vector, purR is transcribed from a phage T7 promoter under the control of a lac operator. The pET24(a) vector in strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (D. N. Arvidson and R. G. Brennan, unpublished) thus replaced the previous method for purR overexpression where pT7-7 and phage CE6 were employed to provide T7 RNA polymerase (11). These manipulations were necessary to negate purR toxicity from a multicopy plasmid. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS for IPTG-induced overexpression (15). Overexpressed protein was purified by two chromatographic steps, DEAE-Sepharose and heparin-agarose as described (16). For purified PurR, the protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an A280 (1%) of 12.9 (11). DNA Binding Site. PurR binds to a 16 bp palindromic site in 19 E. coli operons (1). Two binding sites were used in this study: the 16 bp purF operator and a 16 bp perfect palindromic sequence (1) designated pur. These sites which

974 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 4, 1998 have been used previously (2, 14) were incorporated into oligonucleotides of different lengths. Flanking sequences in oligonucleotides of 24-30 bp have not been observed to influence PurR binding affinity. Corepressor Binding. Equilibrium dialysis was used to determine binding of purine corepressors when the Kd for guanine and hypoxanthine was <20 µM and the Kd for adenine was <35 µM. The binding measurements were carried out as described previously (16). Binding data were fit to the Hill equation (17) using Ultrafit software (Biosoft, Cambridge, U.K.) (eq 1). Y is the fraction of protein bound;

Kd, the dissociation constant; n, the Hill coefficient; and L, free corepressor. Fits were made allowing both Kd and n to vary. In some cases, Kd values were too high to be determined by equilibrium dialysis and gel retardation was used to estimate binding of corepressors to PurR (11). In this method, corepressor binding to PurR is coupled with binding of the holorepressor to operator DNA. The experiments were carried out under conditions where PurR binding to DNA is dependent upon corepressor. The method relies on the observation that the affinity of the PurR-corepressor complex for DNA is more than 200-fold greater than the affinity of PurR for corepressor (11, 14, 16). This relationship assures that once corepressor binds to PurR the complex will bind to DNA. A 30-mer DNA probe with the pur operator was labeled with 32P as described (14). Binding was performed in corepressor-dependent buffer II [100 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 250 mM potassium glutamate, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, and 2% dimethyl sulfoxide]. The 20 µL incubation mixture contained 10 fmol of DNA probe, 15 nM PurR, and varied concentrations of corepressor and buffer II. The concentration of PurR refers to the 38 kDa subunit. The proteinDNA complex and free DNA were separated by electrophoresis, and the gel was dried and counted for radioactivity using a Packard Instant Imager. From these data, the fractional saturation of PurR was estimated at varied concentrations of corepressor. In previous experiments, similar Kd values were determined for binding of hypoxanthine and guanine to PurR by equilibrium dialysis (16) and estimated by gel retardation methods (11). In this work, a control experiment confirmed that the two methods gave similar Kd values for the PurR-hypoxanthine interaction (data not shown). Finally, the binding constants for binding of 6-methylpurine to wild type PurR and the R190Q mutant were determined using a fluorescence anisotropy assay (18, 19). In this assay, a 24 bp oligonucleotide containing the pur operator site was annealed to its complementary strand that is fluoresceinated on the 5-end. The anisotropy measurements were carried out at room temperature in 1 mL of binding buffer II, which also contained 1 µg of poly(dI,dC), 50 nM PurR or R190Q, and 2 nM labeled duplex. The purine was titrated into this mixture. The anisotropy measurements were taken with a Panvera Beacon Fluorescence Polarization instrument. The data were plotted as anisotropy versus purine concentration, and the Kd was calculated using the equation (adapted from ref 19):

Using the experimental data for A (the measured anisotropy), [P]T (the total protein concentration), [C] (the corepressor or purine concentration), and Kd (the protein-DNA equilibrium dissociation binding constant), we fit the equation to determine Kc (the protein-purine equilibrium dissociation binding constant), Amax (the maximum anisotropy value at saturation), and Ao (the initial anisotropy value). Measurement of ApoPurR-DNA Binding. The specific binding of wild type and mutant apoPurR to operator DNA was determined by gel retardation using corepressorindependent buffer I [10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EDTA] (11). In this buffer, PurR assumes the conformation required for high-affinity binding to operator DNA without a requirement for corepressor. This assay was used to evaluate the DNA binding function of corepressor binding mutants. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination. Crystals of the mutant PurR-purine-pur operator complexes were grown by the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method, which was used previously to crystallize the PurRhypoxanthine-purF operator complex (20). Briefly, protein at a concentration of 0.25-0.50 mM was saturated with corepressor and mixed 1:1 (v:v) with a 0.50 mM solution of the 16 bp purF operator or a pur operator site (18), both of which have an additional 5-nucleoside overhang on both oligonucleotide strands, the identity of which is irrelevant to crystallization. The protein-corepressor-DNA solution was mixed 1:1 with the reservoir solution, which is 25% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 0.40 M ammonium sulfate, 50 mM cobalt hexammine chloride, and 0.10 M ammonium phosphate (pH 7.5). Crystals grow initially as thin twodimensional plates and within a period of 2 weeks to several months melt and are replaced by large rhombohedral crystals (typically 0.6 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.3 mm). The mutant PurRpurine-pur operator crystals are isomorphous to the PurRhypoxathine-purF operator crystals (Table 2). X-ray intensity data were collected at room temperature with an Area Detector Systems Corp. (ADCS) multiwire area detector (21) using a Rigaku RU200-H rotating anode operating at 40 kV and 150 mA. Selected crystallographic data for each mutant-purine-DNA complex are listed in Table 2. Structure Determination and Refinement. All seven structures were solved by difference Fourier techniques using the wild type PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex, minus the corepressor, the arginine side chain of residue 190 and solvent, as the starting model for each (2). There is one PurR monomer, purine molecule, and pur or purF operator half-site in the asymmetric unit. Refinement of each mutant complex structure began with several cycles of rigid body refinement and was followed by XYZ (positional) and B factor (thermal parameter) refinement as implemented in TNT (22). The R190Q-guanine-purF operator structure underwent only XYZ refinement due to the limited resolution of the data. Purines and water molecules were built into the structures in the final stages of refinement using either

FRODO (23) or O (24). To ensure the unbiased placement of the purines and any side chains, which underwent significant movements, a series of Fo - Fc omit maps were calculated for each structure. In these omit map calculations, the purine, attendant water molecules, and any rebuilt corepressor binding pocket residues were removed. The model was then subjected to 20-30 cycles of positional and thermal refinement before inspection of the omit density map. Refinement statistics and selected stereochemical parameters (25) are listed in Table 2. RESULTS In Vivo Function of PurR Mutants. On the basis of the critical interaction of Arg190 with the purine corepressor exocyclic 6 position, seen in the X-ray structure of holoPurR bound to operator DNA (2), we have mutagenized this residue to alanine or glutamine. Mutant genes were constructed and integrated into the phage  attachment site of the E. coli chromosome in single copy in order to evaluate repressor function (Figure 2). The purR gene, in this construction (Figure 1A), is controlled by a weak synthetic promoter (Figure 1B) chosen to give expression comparable to that of the wild type gene at its normal site. Western blots of wild type cells and the integrants verified that all strains contained similar PurR levels (not shown). Data in Table 3 show repression of a purF-lacZ reporter by PurR+ and mutant repressors. Repression of purF by PurR+ and R190Q was 18- and 21-fold, respectively, values that are similar to the 17-fold repression by the wild type gene at its normal chromosomal position (8, 26). R190A retained approximately 60% of the function of PurR+. It is necessary to emphasize that the repression assay depends upon corepressor-dependent binding of PurR to the purF operator but does not address which purines function as corepressor.

PurR Purification. The wild type and R190A and R190Q proteins were overexpressed as described in Materials and Methods, and the repressor protein was purified in order to assess corepressor binding directly. For the wild type and the two mutants, PurR accounted for approximately 40% of the soluble protein on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). The elution profiles of PurR from DEAE-Sepharose and heparin-agarose columns were identical for the wild type and mutants. In addition, binding constants similar to that of operator DNA were obtained for the wild type and mutant repressors when determined in corepressor-independent binding buffer I (11). The apparent Kd for wild type PurR was 11 nM, and the values for the mutants were between 7 and 16 nM (data not shown). Binding of Purines to PurR. Three methods were used to determine binding affinities of purines to wild type and

mutant repressors. Equilibrium dialysis was generally used to determine binding of hypoxanthine and guanine in cases where the Kd was less than 20 µM and for adenine when the Kd was less than 35 µM. Due to the limited solubility of PurR in dialysis buffer at 4 °C, in cases of low affinity, binding constants were estimated by a gel retardation assay (11). Binding constants are summarized in Table 4. For wild type PurR, Kd values of 1.6 and 11 µM were obtained for guanine and hypoxanthine, respectively, in close agreement with previous data (16). The apparent Kd value of wild type PurR for adenine was 2460 µM. Thus, the exocyclic atom at position 6 of the purine [a hydrogen bond acceptor for hypoxanthine (O6) and a hydrogen bond donor for adenine (N6)] is mainly responsible for the increased binding affinity of hypoxanthine compared to that of adenine by a factor of more than 220. Binding of Purines to Arg190 Mutants. To evaluate the proposed key role of Arg190 in corepressor specificity, we determined binding affinities for binding of purines to the R190A and R190Q mutants. Binding curves are given in Figure 3 and Kd values summarized in Table 4. Data in Table 4 show that for the R190A repressor the binding affinity for guanine and hypoxanthine was decreased by 9-40-fold whereas the binding affinity for adenine increased by nearly 20-fold as compared to that of the wild type. These changes in binding constants effectively abolish the 220fold specificity for hypoxanthine over adenine and 1500fold specificity for guanine over adenine. In addition, it was found that the R190A repressor bound 6-methylpurine as well as guanine with an observed Kd of 76 µM. Specificity for corepressor was also changed in the R190Q repressor. In this mutant, wild type affinity for guanine and hypo-

xanthine was retained, while the affinity for adenine was increased over 75-fold. Thus, the specificity for hypoxanthine over adenine was reduced from 220- to 6-fold and for guanine over adenine from 1500- to 16-fold. Crystal Structures of R190A Bound to the pur Operator and Corepressors Hypoxanthine, Guanine, Adenine, or 6-Methylpurine. To determine the structural basis of R190A binding to the physiological corepressors, hypoxanthine and guanine, and its increased affinity for adenine and 6-methylpurine, we determined four crystal structures: the R190Ahypoxanthine-pur operator complex, the R190A-guaninepur operator complex, the R190A-adenine-pur operator complex, and the R190A-6-methylpurine-pur operator complex. Superimposition of the CR carbons of these structures and the wild type PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator structure confirms that they are identical with rmsds of 0.16 Å for the R190A-hypoxanthine-pur operator complex, 0.16 Å for the R190A-guanine-pur operator complex, 0.16 Å for the R190A-adenine-pur operator complex, and 0.22 Å for the R190A-6-methylpurine-pur operator complex, all of which are within error of the coordinates. As in the wild type PurR-DNA structure, the DNA is kinked about the central CpG base pair step. The DNA bending angle, which was calculated with CURVES (27) and excluded the first and last base pairs of the 16 bp operator because of their poor electron density, is 54° in the pur operator for R190A bound to hypoxanthine, guanine, and adenine and 52° for the pur operator in the R190A6-methylpurine structure. These values indicate that the DNA structure is essentially identical to that of the PurRhypoxanthine-purF operator structure (54° kink) (2, 18). All other DNA properties, e.g., roll and twist angles and rise per nucleotide, were also nearly identical to those found in the wild type protein-corepressor-DNA structure (2, 18). To explain the expanded specificity and the equilibrium dissociation binding constants of R190A for these four purines, we predicted that all other protein-corepressor contacts would be maintained and water molecules would be recruited to the binding pocket to replace the missing Arg190 interactions with protein-water-corepressor contacts. Because of the potential of water to donate and accept hydrogen bonds, adenine would be expected to bind as well as hypoxanthine and guanine. Examination of the corepres-

FIGURE 4: Views of the corepressor binding pocket of the R190A mutants after the superimposition of their CR carbon atoms onto those of the wild type PurR protein bound to hypoxanthine: (A, top left) R190A-guanine (green) and PurR-hypoxanthine (red), (B, top right) R190A-hypoxanthine complex (yellow) and PurR-hypoxanthine (red), (C, bottom left) R190A-adenine (blue) and PurR-hypoxanthine (red), and (D, bottom right) R190A-6-methylpurine (gray) and PurR-hypoxanthine (red). Note the lack of rotation of the Ser124 hydroxyl group in the R190A-6-methylpurine structure. The hydrogen bond distance between the guanidinium NH2 of Arg190 and the O6 oxygen of hypoxanthine is given in each figure as are the hydrogen bonding distances between the hydroxyl OH of Ser124 and the O6 oxygens of hypoxanthine and guanine or the N6 of adenine. With the exception of that made by R190, all other wild type protein-purine contacts are found in each R190A mutant-purine complex. These include aromatic interactions between the purines and Tyr73, Phe74, and Phe221 van der Waals interaction to C8 and a hydrogen bond to N7 from the Thr192 side chain; and a hydrogen bond between N9 and the carboxylate group of Asp275. These figures were generated with the molecular graphics computer program O (24).

sor binding pockets of the structures of the R190Acorepressor-pur complexes reveals, as expected, that none of the remaining wild type protein-purine interactions are missing and that the purines do not take radically different binding positions (Figure 4A-D). Moreover, the large cavity created in the binding pocket by the loss of the Arg190 side chain is indeed filled with several well-ordered solvent molecules. However, none of these water molecules make direct hydrogen bonds to the exocyclic 6 atom. Rather, the side chain of Ser124, which normally makes a hydrogen bond

to the side chain of Thr67 and stacks atop the Arg190 side chain, rotates into the binding pocket and donates a hydrogen bond to the O6 of guanine (OH-O6, 3.31 Å) (Figure 4A) and hypoxanthine (OH-O6, 3.42 Å) (Figure 4B) and accepts a hydrogen bond from adenine (HO-N6, 3.13 Å) (Figure 4C). When 6-methylpurine is bound, Ser124 maintains its hydrogen bond to the side chain of Thr67 but makes van der Waals contact to the exocyclic methyl group (Figure 4D). The basis for the slightly increased affinity of R190A for guanine compared to those of the other three purines is

978 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 4, 1998 explained by both a specific protein-base-water mediated contact and protein-purine electrostatic complementarity. These contributions have been described recently for the wild type PurR-guanine-purF operator complex (28). In the R190A structure, the same interaction is found between a water molecule and the exocyclic hydrogen bond donor N2 atom of guanine (H2O-N2, 3.33 Å; not shown). This hydrogen bond specifies a donor at this position on the purine ring as both hydrogen bond donors of this water molecule are taken: one by the carboxyl side chain of Glu222 (O 1HOH, 3.20 Å) and the other by the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Phe221 (CO-HOH, 3.04 Å). Additional specificity for guanine, in both the mutant and wild type proteins, arises from better electrostatic complementarity between the negative corepressor binding pocket and the positive exocyclic amino 2 group of guanine (28), a binding feature that is becoming more appreciated (29). Because of the noted importance of the Ser124 side chain in the R190A mutant, Ser124 was replaced by an alanine or an aspartate to assess further its function in corepressor binding. Data in Table 3 indicate that a S124A mutant retained nearly 90% function but when that mutant was combined with an R190A mutation repression was virtually abolished (Table 3). In the latter double mutant, it was thought that an aspartate replacement of Ser124 might retain hydrogen bonding to the 6-amino group of adenine. However, the inactivity of these mutants suggests that adenine either was not bound or if bound was unable to activate PurR. Similar results were obtained for an R190A/S124N double mutant. Crystal Structures of R190Q Bound to the purF Operator and Corepressors Hypoxanthine, Guanine, and Adenine. To elucidate the stereochemical and structural basis by which R190Q binds the natural corepressors, hypoxanthine and guanine, with unchanged affinity, and adenine with physiologically relevant affinity, we determined three crystal structures: the R190Q-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex, the R190Q-guanine-purF operator complex, and the R190Q-adenine-purF operator complex. Again as anticipated, the corepressor binding pockets of each of the R190Q-corepressor-purF operator complexes reveal that none of the remaining wild type protein-purine interactions are missing and that the bases do not take radically different binding positions (Figure 5A-D). Superimposition of the CRs of each of these structures onto the corresponding atoms of the wild type PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator structure confirms their structural identity and yields rmsds of 0.17 Å for the R190Q-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex, 0.27 Å for the R190Q-guanine-purF operator complex, and 0.18 Å for the R190Q-adenine-purF operator complex (all within error of the coordinates). Again as observed in the wild type PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator and the R190A-corepressor(s)-pur operator structures, the DNA is kinked about the central CpG base pair step. The DNA bending angles, which were calculated with CURVES (27) and excluded the first and last base pairs of the 16 bp operator because of their poor electron density, are 50°, 50°, and 49° in the purF site for R190Q bound to hypoxanthine, adenine, and guanine, respectively, again indicating that the DNA structure is essentially identical to that seen in the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator structure (2, 18). All other DNA properties, e.g., roll and twist angles

Lu et al. and rise per nucleotide, were also nearly identical to those found in the wild type protein-corepressor-DNA structure. To design a PurR with expanded corepressor specificity of high affinity, we predicted that a glutamine side chain, having both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, would reorient in the binding pocket to allow the R190Q mutant to bind adenine as well as hypoxanthine and guanine. However, glutamine can replace only one of the two hydrogen bonds donated by the wild type arginine side chain to the purine O6, and we expected some loss of affinity for the natural corepressors. On the contrary, the in vitro corepressor binding data reveal that the R190Q mutant binds guanine and hypoxanthine with wild type affinity and, therefore, must compensate for the loss of this direct hydrogen bond. To do so, the R190Q mutant recruits a water molecule to the position occupied by the guanidinium NH2 of Arg190 in the wild type structure (compare panels A, C, and D of Figure 5 to panel B). From this position, the water molecule allows the R190Q mutant to form a protein-water-purine hydrogen bond that satisfies either the remaining lone pair electrons of the O6 atom of hypoxanthine and guanine or the remaining hydrogen atom of the N6 moiety of adenine. Moreover, in the R190Q-6-oxopurine structures, the glutamine carboxamide nitrogen engages in a hydrogen bond to the O of Thr192 (Figure 5A, D). The result of this hydrogen bond network is a wild type affinity of R190Q for the physiological corepressors (Figure 5A, D) and by a 180° rotation about 3, which swaps the positions of the O and NH2 atoms (Figure 5C), its tight binding to adenine (Table 4). In fact, the R190Q mutant displays a more than 74-fold higher affinity for adenine than wild type PurR and thus has extended corepressor specificity as designed. However, as a consequence of the rotation about the 3 torsion angle, the side chain oxygen atoms of Gln190 and Thr192 face each other. To avoid their unfavorable electrostatic interaction, the side chains move away from each other slightly (Figure 5C). Although the resolution of the data does not allow us to quantify its movement, adenine is somewhat rotated clockwise in the binding pocket with respect to the other bound purines (Figure 6A) and guanine is pushed up (Figure 6B), presumably to make its best NH2 -O6 hydrogen bond. Finally, there is a close approach of the Gln190 carboxamide oxygen and purine O6 oxygen atoms in the R190Qguanine-purF operator complex that permits these atoms to make van der Waals contacts (Figure 5A). DISCUSSION In the X-ray structure of the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex, residue Arg190 was recognized to be a primary determinant of corepressor specificity by virtue of NH and NH2 hydrogen bonds with the hypoxanthine O6. These interactions require the atom at the exocyclic 6 position of the purine to be a hydrogen bond acceptor and thereby effectively preclude adenine binding. In this work, we have replaced Arg190 with either alanine or glutamine in order to assess directly the function of this residue and the structural consequences of such substitutions. Measurements of repression and in vitro purine binding have confirmed the critical role of this residue in corepressor binding. Replacement of Arg190 with alanine results in an 18-fold increase in affinity for adenine but diminishes the binding

All hydrogen bond donor-acceptor lengths are given as is the van der Waals contact distance between the O of Gln190 and the O6 of guanine (see also Figure 6A). In the R190Q-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex structure, weak electron density is observed near the N1 of hypoxanthine and is presumably due to the water molecule found in the other structures. However, it is not included here. The water molecule shown donating a hydrogen bond to the O6 of guanine was poorly refined, presumably due to the limited resolution of the data. As described in the figure legend of Figure 4, with the exception of that made by R190, all other wild type protein-purine contacts are found in each R190Q mutant-purine complex. These figures were generated with the molecular graphics computer program O (24).

affinity for guanine and hypoxanthine by 43- and 9-fold, respectively. The overall observed higher equilibrium dissociation constants of R190A for guanine and hypoxanthine arise in large part from the loss of three R190-purine interactions, two to the O6 atom and a water-mediated bond to the N1 atom of hypoxanthine or guanine (2, 28). Surprisingly, unlike wild type PurR, the R190A mutant protein can also bind 6-methylpurine, a base without a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor at the exocyclic 6 position, as well as guanine. The crystal structures of R190A in complex with the pur operator site and each of these purines reveal the stereochemical bases of their binding. In the absence of the bulky arginine side chain, residue Ser124 breaks its wild type hydrogen bond with Thr67, moves toward the corepressor binding pocket, when occupied by hypoxanthine, guanine, or adenine, rotates its hydroxyl side chain toward their exocyclic 6 position, and engages in hydrogen bonds with each (Figure 4A-C). In this way, Ser124 acts as a replacement for the Arg190 side chain in this protein. However, the hydrogen bonds made between Ser124 and these purines are clearly not enough to restore

wild type affinity (Table 4), and their strength, as estimated by the distance between the two interacting atoms, should not be considered the most important indicator of binding affinity (compare the hydrogen bond lengths and Kd values of R190A-adenine and R190A-hypoxanthine). Other factors, such as protein-purine electrostatic complementarity and purine desolvation, especially in the case of 6-methylpurine binding, must play a role (28). Another consequence of the replacement of arginine by alanine at position 190 is the increased hydrophobicity of the binding pocket, which aids indirectly the binding of 6-methylpurine. Although found in its wild type location, the Ser124 side chain again assists in this binding by providing van der Waals contacts to the 6-methyl group (Figure 4D). The substitution of Ser124 by aspartate or asparagine in the context of the R190A replacement was an attempt to increase the affinity of this protein for adenine while decreasing its affinity for hypoxanthine and guanine. However, the double mutants failed completely to repress transcription in vivo (Table 3). The longer side chain of

Lu et al. the physiologicial corepressors (2, 18, 28) and plays a role in maintaining the architecture of the corepressor binding pocket by making a salt bridge to the side chain of solventinaccessible Arg196. The glutamine replacement of Arg190 was designed to permit this mutant protein to retain its capacity to bind tightly to guanine and hypoxanthine via a side chain NH2 -O6 hydrogen bond while gaining the ability to bind adenine with high affinity by a side chain O -N6 hydrogen bond. Although the glutamine side chain can engage in only one direct hydrogen bond to the exocyclic 6 position, as compared to two provided by the arginine guanidinium group, the affinity of the R190Q protein for the natural corepressors is equal to that of the wild type PurR and for adenine is 75-fold higher (Table 4). As a result, in vivo function is indistinguishable from that of the wild type (Table 3). The crystal structures of the R190Q-purine-DNA complexes reveal the chemical basis for the high affinity of this mutant repressor for these purines (Figure 5A-D). In addition to the predicted direct hydrogen bond between the glutamine side chain and the purine O6 or N6 exocyclic groups, the remaining lone pair of the O6 of hypoxanthine or guanine or the remaining hydrogen atom of the N6 of adenine makes a second hydrogen bond to a water molecule that is recruited to the corepressor binding pocket (Figure 5A,C,D). Clearly, water can play a critical role in multiple biological processes such as enzyme catalysis, thermostability, and protein-ligand binding (28, 33, 34), and recruitment of a water molecule to replace a missing side chain hydrogen bond donor or acceptor after its removal by site-directed mutagenesis has been reported (35, 36). However, to our knowledge, this is the first structural example in which the recruited water molecule serves to maintain the wild type affinity for the natural ligands and to increase dramatically the affinity for a nonphysiologically relevant ligand. A priori one would think that the localization of these water molecules would be entropically unfavorable and, hence, result in a comparatively lower binding affinity of the mutant protein for the 6-oxopurines. On the other hand, the formation of the observed protein-water-purine hydrogen bonding network is enthalpically very favorable and should contribute significantly to the high affinity. These thermodynamic considerations parallel closely those of wild type PurR. In its corepressor-free form, the Arg190 side chain is on a loop that is completely disordered and, therefore, entropically favorable (3). Upon binding corepressor, the loop becomes locked down and the Arg190 side chain ordered. Again, the loss of side chain entropy is offset by the enthalpic gain of the three hydrogen bonds that Arg190 makes either directly or through water to two purine atoms (2, 28). Despite the high affinity of adenine for R190Q, it remains 6- and 16-fold lower than those of hypoxanthine and guanine, respectively (Table 4). This observation may be explained in part by considering the following series of purine-protein and protein-protein hydrogen bonds: (1) the carboxylate side chain of residue Asp275 can only accept a hydrogen bond from the protonated N9 nitrogen of these three purines, (2) the hydroxyl side chain of residue Thr192 can only donate a hydrogen bond to the deprotonated N7 of these three purines (Figure 5A,C,D), and (3) in the structures of R190Q bound to guanine or hypoxanthine, the observed hydrogen

This rotation increases the O -O6 distance from 2.64 to 3.02 Å. These figures were generated with the molecular graphics computer program O (24).

the aspartate or asparagine might possibly interfere sterically with corepressor binding. The R190A mutation reveals the capacity of Ser124 to break its hydrogen bond with Thr67 and rotate into the corepressor binding pocket to hydrogen bond with purines, which contain hydrogen bond donors or acceptors at their exocyclic 6 position, and provides a striking example of the significance of plasticity and adaptability in proteins. Interestingly, Ser124 is one of only two Ramachandran outliers in PurR-corepressor-pur complexes (Table 2). This side chain is positioned perfectly to function in corepressor release as it is located above the "specificity loop" (residues 188193) which undergoes a disorder to order transition upon corepressor binding (3). Thus, the strain associated with this side chain may play a role in corepressor binding dynamics. This is supported by the finding that this strain is nearly completely relieved in the unliganded form of PurR (3). The significance of such strain has been noted in other structures and is found to be intimately associated with the function of the protein (30, 31). Striking examples include the histidinecontaining phosphocarrier protein, HPr, where it has been postulated that the strain associated with Ala6 ultimately facilitates the phosphotransferase process from enzyme I to HPr (30) and -lactamase where two Ramachandran outliers contribute in the positioning of key catalytic components (32). Consistent with the finding that  and  outliers have significant functional importance, the other Ramachandran outlier of PurR, Asp275, makes a contact to the N9 atom of

Redesign of Corepressor Specificity of PurR bond between Gln190 and Thr192 requires that the glutamine side chain be the hydrogen bond donor and the Thr192 side chain the acceptor (Figure 5A,D). However, when adenine is bound and the Gln190 side chain is rotated 180° to satisfy the hydrogen bond acceptor requirements of N6, the hypoxanthine/guanine binding configuration would bring the lone pair electrons of the Thr192 and Gln190 side chains too close. To avoid such proximity, the Gln190 side chain moves away by at least 0.5 Å (Figure 5C). In turn, this movement is the likely cause of the slightly altered location of adenine with respect to the other purines (Figure 6A). Therefore, the absence of hydrogen bonding partners for Thr192 O and Gln190 O provides a good chemical rationale for the lower affinity of R190Q for adenine than for the natural corepressors. Another contributor to the less favorable R190Qadenine binding is the poorer electrostatic complementarity between the partial charges on its N1 ( ) -0.81) and C2H ( ) 0.07) atoms and the strongly negative electrostatic nature of the corepressor binding pocket. In support of this latter factor is our recent analysis of the crystal structure of the PurR-guanine-purF operator, which revealed that the better electrostatic complementarity between wild type PurR and the stronger partial positive charge of the guanine N1 ( ) 0.41), N2H2 ( ) 0.43), and N2H1 ( ) 0.43) atoms, as compared to their N1 ( ) 0.41) and C2H ( ) 0.010) hypoxanthine counterparts, contribute in part to the higher affinity of guanine for PurR (28). A similar contribution to the increased affinity of R190Q for guanine compared to that for hypoxanthine is likely. This, of course, includes the reasonable assumption that the free energies of the corepressor-free conformations of wild type PurR and R190Q are very similar. In conclusion, PurR mutant proteins R190Q and R190A are redesigned repressors with expanded corepressor specificity. Specifically, the R190A protein binds guanine, hypoxanthine, adenine, and 6-methylpurine with nearly equal affinity, albeit the affinity is reduced with respect to wild type PurR. Their binding affinities result in part from either a new compensatory hydrogen bond formed between the rotated hydroxyl side chain of Ser124 and the exocyclic 6 positions of guanine, hypoxanthine, and adenine or the combination of van der Waals contacts between the Ser124 side chain and the 6-methyl group of 6-methylpurine and the energetically more favorable desolvation of this purine. The R190Q protein, aided by direct and water-mediated contacts, is able to bind adenine with a nearly 75-fold higher affinity than wild type PurR while still maintaining the wild type affinity for guanine and hypoxanthine. By combining the R190Q mutation with additional structure-based substitutions of key residues in the corepressor-binding pocket, we should be able to increase further the affinity of PurR for adenine, e.g., E222Q or E222M, as well as to provide new corepressor specificities for PurR.
