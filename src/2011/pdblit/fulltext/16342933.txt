ABSTRACT: Indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) catalyzes the fifth step in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. It belongs to the large and versatile family of ( R)8-barrel enzymes but has an unusual N-terminal extension of about 40 residues. Limited proteolysis with trypsin of IGPS from both Sulfolobus solfataricus (sIGPS) and Thermotoga maritima (tIGPS) removes about 25 N-terminal residues and one of the two extra helices contained therein. To assess the role of the extension, the N-terminally truncated variants sIGPS(1-26) and tIGPS(1-25) were produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized in comparison to the wild-type enzymes. Both sIGPS(1-26) and tIGPS(1-25) have unchanged oligomerization states and turnover numbers. In contrast, their Michaelis constants for the substrate 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate are increased, and their resistance toward unfolding induced by heat and guanidinium chloride is decreased. sIGPS(1-26) was crystallized, and its X-ray structure was solved at 2.8 Å resolution. The comparison with the known structure of sIGPS reveals small differences that account for its reduced substrate affinity and protein stability. The structure of the core of sIGPS(1-26) is, however, unchanged compared to sIGPS, explaining its retained catalytic activity and consistent with the idea that it evolved from the same ancestor as the phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase and the R-subunit of tryptophan synthase. These ( R)8-barrel enzymes catalyze the reactions preceding and following IGPS in tryptophan biosynthesis but lack an N-terminal extension.

The ( R)8- or TIM-barrel structure seems to be nature's favorite scaffold to constitute enzymic active sites (1-3). The canonical ( R)8 barrel is composed of eight R units, in which a -strand is connected to an R-helix by a R loop. The individual R units are linked by R loops. In all known ( R)8-barrel enzymes, active site residues are located at the C-termini of some of the parallel -strands and also in the R loops. This similarity suggests that a large fraction of ( R)8-barrel enzymes may have arisen from an ancestral precursor by divergent evolution, despite the wide range of

chemically diverse reactions catalyzed by them (4-6). Three consecutively operating enzymes of the pathway of tryptophan biosynthesis, namely, phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase (PRAI),1 indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS), and the R-subunit of tryptophan synthase (TSR), possess the ( R)8-barrel fold. They have a common phosphate binding motif in R loops 7 and 8 (7). The structural and functional relationships between these enzymes, as well as the similarity of their substrates, suggest that they have evolved from a common ancestor. IGPS, which catalyzes the conversion of 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate (CdRP) to indole-3glycerol phosphate (IGP) (Figure 1), carries an N-terminal extension of the first -strand (Figure 2). This extension is absent in PRAI and TSR, which seems to contradict the hypothesis of divergent evolution. This N-terminal extension is about 40 residues long and includes both helix R0 that lines the active site cleft and helix R00 at the opposite face of the barrel. Earlier deletion studies (8) found that the

Schneider et al. Thermotoga maritima [tIGPS (10)] and investigated their catalytic and structural properties as well as their thermostabilities. The KM values for the substrate 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate (CdRP) of the recombinantly truncated variants sIGPS(1-26) and tIGPS(1-25) are drastically increased compared to those of the wild-type IGPSs, and their stabilities toward heat inactivation and chemical unfolding are decreased. However, the catalytic turnover numbers are unchanged. The X-ray structure of sIGPS(1-26) has been solved at 2.8 Å resolution by molecular replacement. A comparison with native sIGPS (9) shows that the entire helix R0 can be removed without significant effects on the structural core of the enzyme. These results therefore support a common evolutionary origin of the three ( R)8-barrel enzymes of tryptophan biosynthesis.

N-terminal portion of helix R0 is not essential for catalysis but rather for effective substrate binding, suggesting that the catalytic function of IGPS is sustained even by the canonical ( R)8 barrel. To elucidate the role of the N-terminal extension of IGPS further, we constructed more extensively truncated variants of IGPS from Sulfolobus solfataricus [sIGPS (9)] and

N-Terminal Extension of a ( R)8-Barrel Enzyme MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA Manipulation and Sequence Analysis. Preparation of DNA, amplification, extraction with restriction endonucleases, and sequencing were performed as described (11). Cloning of strpC, strpC(1-26), ttrpC, and ttrpC(125). The strpC gene encoding sIGPS was amplified by PCR, using strpC-pDS56/RBSII/SphI (9) as the template and the oligonucleotides 5-CTA GCT AGC ATG CCA CGT TAT3 and 5-CCG CTC GAG TAG TAT AAA TTC-3 (restriction sites in bold) as 5- and 3-primers. The ttrpC gene encoding tIGPS was also amplified by PCR, using ttrpC-pET21a(+) (12) as the template and the oligonucleotides 5-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGA GAA GAC TC-3 and 5-CCG CTC GAG CTC TGA CCA TGC-3 (restriction sites in bold) as 5- and 3-primers. Both genes were cloned into pET21a(+), using the restriction endonucleases NheI and XhoI for strpC and NdeI and XhoI for ttrpC. The 3primers for the amplification of strpC and for the amplification of ttrpC were designed such that the internal stop codons were deleted. As a consequence, six plasmid-encoded histidine codons were added to the 3-end of the genes, which allowed the purification of the protein products by metal chelate affinity chromatography. The strpC(1-26) and ttrpC(1-25) genes encoding sIGPS(1-26) and tIGPS(1-25) were cloned into pET21a(+) in an analogous way as described for the wild-type genes, using the same templates, the same restriction endonucleases, and the same 3-primers. However, the 5-primers 5-CTA GCT AGC ATG CCA CGT TAT-3 and 5-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGA GAA GAC TC-3 (restriction sites in bold) were designed such that the first 78 bp and 75 bp were deleted in strpC and ttrpC, respectively. Heterologous Gene Expression and Purification of the Protein Products. Expression was conducted in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3) RIPL cells (Stratagene), which contain the gene for the phage T7 polymerase on their chromosome and plasmids for tRNA genes that are rarely used in E. coli. An overnight culture of freshly transformed cells containing LB medium with ampicillin (0.15 mg/mL), chloramphenicol (0.03 mg/mL), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ mL) was used to inoculate 2 L of the same medium, which was stirred at 37 °C until the OD600 reached a value between 0.5 and 0.6. Expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG and continued overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (Sorvall RL 5B plus, GS3 rotor, 4000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 30 mL of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, lysed by sonification (Branson sonifier W-250 D, 2 × 2 min, amplitude 50%), and centrifuged again (Sorvall RC 5 plus, rotor 22500, 12000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C). The analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that sIGPS was present in equal amounts in the soluble and the insoluble fractions of the cell extract. In contrast, both sIGPS(1-26) and tIGPS(1-25) were found almost exclusively in the soluble fraction. For unknown reasons, tIGPS was found mainly in the soluble fraction of cultures that were grown without IPTG but was absent from both the soluble and insoluble fraction of cultures containing 1 mM IPTG. All proteins were purified from the soluble fraction of the cell extract, which was first dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. To fragment nucleic acids, 250 units of benzonase and 2 mM MgCl2 were added, followed by an incubation for 1 h at 37

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 50, 2005 16407 °C. In the case of the wild-type enzymes sIGPS and tIGPS the extracts were then incubated at 75 °C for 15 min to precipitate thermolabile host proteins. In the case of the N-terminally truncated variants, heating was performed at 55 and 65 °C, respectively. However, these temperatures were not high enough for an efficient enrichment of either sIGPS(1-26) and tIGPS(1-25) and were therefore omitted in most purifications. The heat-precipitated host proteins were removed by centrifugation (Sorvall RC 5 plus, rotor 22500, 12000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was applied at room temperature onto a Ni2+-chelate affinity column (AKTA basic 10 better chromatography system, ¨ Amersham Bioscience; POROS MC/20 column, volume 7.8 mL, Applied Biosystems) that had been equilibrated with 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 300 mM KCl. The bound proteins were eluted with 10 column volumes of a linear gradient of 0-600 mM imidazole dissolved in the same buffer. sIGPS, tIGPS, and their N-terminally truncated variants eluted between 50 and 200 mM imidazole. The fractions containing pure protein (as judged by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, dialyzed against 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, concentrated by ultrafiltration, dripped into liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The yields were between 10 and 40 mg of protein from 2 L of growth medium. Trypsin Digestion and N-Terminal Sequencing. sIGPS and tIGPS were incubated with trypsin at a molar ratio of 10:1 in 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 at 25 °C. After different time intervals, aliquots were taken, and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were Westernblotted (semidry transfer unit model TE70, Hoefer Pharmacia Biotech) onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, stained by Coomassie blue, cut from the dried membrane, and N-terminally sequenced by automated Edman degradation (Applied Biosystems Procise). Analytical Methods, Steady-State Enzyme Kinetics, and Ligand Titration Studies. SDS-PAGE, analytical gel filtration, fluorescence emission and circular dichroism spectroscopy, and estimation of protein concentrations were performed as described (13). The catalytic activity of IGPS variants using the enzymatically produced substrate CdRP was monitored fluorometrically as described (14, 15). The values for the steady-state enzyme kinetic parameters kcat and KMCdRP were determined from saturation curves, which were constructed from initial velocity measurements recorded at 25 °C in 50 mM EPPS buffer, pH 7.5, 4 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT in the presence of various concentrations of CdRP. Whereas sIGPS, tIGPS, and tIGPS(1-25) showed hyperbolic saturation curves, the saturation curve of sIGPS(126) was linear over the entire tested concentration range (0312 µM) of CdRP. As a consequence, only the catalytic efficiency paramter kcat/KMCdRP could be determined for this variant but not the separate kcat and KMCdRP values. The binding of the substrate analogue reduced CdRP (rCdRP) to tIGPS and tIGPS(1-25) at 25 °C in 50 mM EPPS buffer, pH 7.5, 4 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT was followed by fluorescence energy transfer and analyzed as described (16). Heat InactiVation. The kinetics of irreversible heat inactivation were measured as described (9). The proteins were incubated in 50 mM EPPS buffer, pH 7.0, containing 4 mM EDTA at 75 °C [sIGPS and sIGPS(1-26)] or 80 °C [tIGPS

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Preparation of sIGPS(1-26) and tIGPS(1-25). Because both sIGPS and tIGPS carry about 10 Arg and Lys residues in the N-terminal sequences preceding strand 1 (Figure 2), we tested their partial or complete removal by trypsin at 25 °C. The progress of the reaction was monitored by SDS-PAGE, which identified one major digestion product for each enzyme. N-Terminal sequencing revealed that trypsin cleaved sIGPS about as efficiently at the C-termini of either R23 or R26 and tIGPS exclusively at the C-terminus of R28. The sequence alignment (Figure 2B) shows that R26 in sIGPS corresponds to V25 in tIGPS, which are located in the loop connecting helices R0 and R00. The canonical ( R)8 barrels are apparently resistant to tryptic cleavage under these conditions. To obtain large amounts of sIGPS, sIGPS(1-26), tIGPS, and tIGPS(1-25), the corresponding genes were cloned by PCR into pET21a(+) and were heterologously expressed in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were enriched from the soluble cell extract. As judged by SDS-PAGE, the final preparations were more than 95% pure. Oligomerization States. Both sIGPS (9) and tIGPS (10) are intrinsically monomeric proteins. tIGPS can dimerize, however, by oxidative disulfide formation between its unique, exposed cysteine (C102) residue (20). Analytical gel filtration was performed to check whether the N-terminal deletion of about 25 residues affects the oligomerization states of both proteins. sIGPS and sIGPS(1-26) eluted as single symmetric peaks corresponding to molecular masses of 23.5 and 26.3 kDa (data not shown), which are somewhat lower and identical, respectively, than the calculated monomer values of 28.6 and 26.4 kDa. In contrast, both tIGPS and tIGPS(1-25) eluted as two peaks. The trailing peaks correspond to molecular masses of 24.2 and 28.2 kDa, similar to the calculated monomer values of 28.7 and 26.6 kDa. The leading peaks correspond to dimer masses of 39.3 and 47.1 kDa. Obviously, the tendency of tIGPS to form covalently linked dimers seems to be retained in tIGPS(1-25). Thus, we conclude that the N-terminal truncations do not change the association states of sIGPS or tIGPS. Catalytic ActiVities. To better understand the functional role of the N-terminal extensions, steady-state enzyme kinetic studies were undertaken to compare the wild-type enzymes with their truncated variants. Table 2 summarizes the turnover numbers (kcat) and the Michaelis constants (KMCdRP) as well as the catalytic efficiency parameters (kcat/KMCdRP) at 25 °C that were deduced from substrate saturation curves. Since the catalytic rate of sIGPS(1-26) is a linear function of CdRP up to the highest assayed concentration of 312 µM, its KMCdRP value must be strongly elevated compared to that of sIGPS.

and tIGPS(1-25)]. Aliquots were taken after different times, chilled on ice, and centrifuged (Eppendorf 5415R, 13000 rpm, 3 min, 4 °C). The residual activity of the supernatant was measured at 50 °C in 50 mM EPPS buffer, pH 7.0, 4 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. The half-lives of inactivation were calculated by fitting the decrease of the initial velocities to a single exponential function (program SigmaPlot 5.0). Chemical Unfolding. sIGPS, sIGPS(1-26), tIGPS, and tIGPS(1-25) were incubated with various concentrations of guanidinium chloride dissolved in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 at 25 °C. Protein unfolding was followed by the decrease of the circular dichroism signal at 220 nm [not for tIGPS(1-25), which generated ambiguous results] and of the fluorescence emission at 320 nm after excitation with 280 nm [not for sIGPS(1-26), which contains no tryptophan residues]. The signals were followed after different time intervals until no further change was observed. Moreover, the proteins were completely unfolded in 6 M guanidinium chloride, and refolding was induced by removing the chaotropic reagent by means of dilution into 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 at 25 °C. Crystallization of sIGPS(1-26) and Data Collection. Crystallization was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. Crystals were grown by mixing equal volumes of a reservoir solution containing 30% PEG 8000 and 0.2 M ammonium sulfate as precipitants in 0.1 M MES buffer at pH 6.5, with protein concentrated to 40 mg/ mL. X-ray diffraction data from a single crystal of approximate size 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.3 mm3 were collected on a MAR-Research image plate area detector mounted on a rotating anode generator. Data evaluation was performed with MOSFLM and the CCP4 suite of programs (17). The space group of the measured crystal is P212121 with cell dimensions a ) 39.2 Å, b ) 61.4 Å, and c ) 80.4 Å. The crystal, containing one molecule per asymmetric unit (VM ) 1.92), had a solvent content of 35.9%. Statistics on the data collection are summarized in Table 1. Structure Solution and Refinement. The structure of sIGPS(1-26) was solved by molecular replacement [XPLOR (18)] using the structure of sIGPS that was truncated by the first 26 amino acids as the search model (9) (PDB

from the slope of the graph, it follows that its turnover number must also be increased compared to sIGPS. Similarly, sIGPS(1-9) lacking the N-terminal loop and the first turn of helix R0 has a kcat value comparable to that of sIGPS and a 100-fold increased KMCdRP value (8). By selecting mutants of sIGPS that promote increased turnover at low temperatures, among others, the variant sIGPS-P2Q(4-28) was isolated (21). It contains a large deletion similar to sIGPS(1-26). The kcat value of tIGPS(1-25) is practically identical to that of tIGPS. However, its KMCdRP value is increased almost 30-fold. Fluorometric titration of tIGPS(1-25) with the substrate analogue reduced CdRP (rCdRP) yielded a value for the thermodynamic dissociation constant (KDrCdRP) of 0.46 µM, which is similar to the KMCdRP value of 0.69 µM (Table 2). Titration of 1 µM tIGPS with rCdRP resulted in a linear curve up to about equal molar concentrations of the ligand. These findings suggest that the KDrCdRP of tIGPS is at least 1 order of magnitude smaller than the KDrCdRP of tIGPS(1-25). Taken together, these results show that the entire helix R0 is expendable for catalysis of the IGPS reaction but that its stepwise deletion results in a stepwise and dramatic loss of substrate binding affinity. Stability Measurements. Thermal stabilities were assessed from the kinetics of irreversible heat inactivation. The proteins were incubated at 75 °C [sIGPS and sIGPS(126)] or 80 °C [tIGPS and tIGPS(1-25)]. Samples were drawn after different time intervals, chilled on ice, and tested for their residual activities at 50 °C. The resulting half-lives (t1/2) show that the N-terminally truncated variants lose activity about 40-fold faster than the wild-type enzymes (Table 3). The resistance toward unfolding induced by guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) was monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy to follow the loss in secondary and tertiary structure, respectively. For all proteins, chemical denaturation was reversible. The concentration of GdmCl (D1/2) necessary to unfold 50% of the wildtype proteins compared to the truncated variants was

somewhat higher [sIGPS versus sIGPS(1-26)] and almost identical [tIGPS versus tIGPS(1-25)] (Table 3). These results suggest that the native extension, including helix R0, considerably increases the kinetic barrier for inactivation of both sIGPS and tIGPS but has only a limited influence on their conformational stabilities. The removal of the Nterminal extension also seems to modify the chemically induced unfolding mechanism of IGPS at equilibrium. At pH 7 only the fully native and unfolded states of sIGPS are populated. At pH 9, however, an equlibrium unfolding intermediate of sIGPS was detected (22). In contrast, sIGPS(1-26) seems to unfold via an intermediate even at pH 7 (23). It was argued that, at pH 7, the N-terminal extension may selectively stabilize the native state relative to the intermediate by forming salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with the core of the barrel (Table 4). These interactions would be absent in sIGPS(1-26) and weakened at pH 9 in sIGPS, due to the titration of positively charged groups with abnormally low pKa values (22). As a consequence, the relative stabilization of the native state would no longer occur, and the population of the intermediate would increase to a detectable level (23). Along the same lines, the unfolding of tIGPS(1-25) at pH 7 takes place in several phases, which suggests that an intermediate is significantly populated. At the same pH value, the unfolding of tIGPS occurs in a

Schneider et al. posed (Figure 3A). Figure 3B depicts the distances between equivalent CR positions as a function of the residue number (rms deviation 0.68 Å). The largest deviations are found between residues P57 and L60 in loop 1R1. However, this region is highly variable in different crystal forms of wildtype sIGPS as well, depending on pH and ionic strength (19). Therefore, the observed deviations seem not to be caused by deleting the N-terminal extension, and the structure of the canonical ( R)8-barrel core of sIGPS is unaffected by removal of helix R0. The IGPS reaction consists of a sequence of condensation, decarboxylation, and dehydration steps and is practically irreversible, due to both the formation of the pyrrole ring of indole and the release of CO2. X-ray structure (24) and mutational analysis (24, 25) imply that the side chains of K110 and E159 of sIGPS act in the reaction as general acid and general base and that residues E51 and K53 assist catalysis by forming specific salt bridges with K110 and the carboxylate moiety of the substrate CdRP. The location and conformations of all of these residues are identical between sIGPS and sIGPS(1-26) within experimental error, which explains why the kcat values of the N-terminally truncated variants are practically identical to those of the wild-type enzymes (Table 2). In the wild-type enzyme, the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the benzene moiety of the substrate CdRP and the substrate analogue reduced CdRP (rCdRP) (24) is formed by residues P57 (loop 1R1), F89 (loop 2R2), and F112 (loop 3R3), the hydrophobic tail of R182, L184, and L187 (loop 6R6), and W8 (on helix R0). Figure 4 shows the hydrophobic pocket of sIGPS(1-26) superimposed on that of wild-type sIGPS in complex with rCdRP (24). The backbone conformation of loop 1R1 with P57 in sIGPS(1-26) differs slightly from that of the wildtype enzyme due to its intrinsic flexibility as described in Figure 3. In contrast, the backbones of loops 2R2, 3R3, and 6R6 are essentially identical in both structures. The side chain of F89 remains unchanged upon removal of helix R0. However, the phenyl ring of F112 is rotated by approximately 30° around 2, and the side chain of L184 has shifted toward the solvent. As shown in Table 2, deletion of residues 1-9 of sIGPS does not alter kcat appreciably but increases KMCdRP significantly. Since residues 1-7 are distant from the substrate binding site, it is likely that the loss of W8 (and posssibly L9) is mainly responsible for the decreased substrate binding affinity of sIGPS(1-9). The

more cooperative manner, in accordance with the presence of lower concentrations of the intermediate (data not shown). X-ray Structure of sIGPS(1-26). The crystal structure of sIGPS(1-26) was solved to understand better the different performances and stabilities of sIGPS and sIGPS(1-26). It has the same ( R)8-barrel fold as the wild-type enzyme except that the entire helix R0 and the first half of loop R0R00 are missing. No electron density was found for the N-terminal residues Q27 and R28. These residues were therefore discarded from the model. For a more detailed comparison, the CR traces of sIGPS (PDB entry code 1IGS) and sIGPS(1-26) (PDB entry code 2c3z) were superim-

N-Terminal Extension of a ( R)8-Barrel Enzyme

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 50, 2005 16411 rationalized on the basis of the structures of sIGPS and sIGPS(1-26). Numerous stabilizing contacts between side chains of the N-terminal extension and the canonical ( R)8 barrel, as well as key residues involved in binding CdRP, are lost in the truncated protein. The intrinsic enzymatic function of IGPS, however, does not require the extension, which proves that all catalytic residues are provided by the barrel core of the enzyme. This notion is in keeping with the hypothesis that TIM-barrel enzymes involved in the tryptophan biosynthesis have diverged from a common ancestor during evolution (4).

FIGURE 5: 2Fo - Fc electron density map contoured at 1.0  viewing the hydrophobic pocket at the active site of sIGPS(126). The water-filled cavity (magenta spheres) that arises by the cleavage of the N-terminal extension is in the wild-type enzyme partially occupied by the hydrophobic side chains of residues W8 and L9 at the N-terminus of helix R0. The figure was produced with "O" (28).

further increased KMCdRP of sIGPS(1-26) might be attributed to the deletion of L12 and V13, which are not an integral part of the hydrophobic (r)CdRP binding pocket but are located close enough to influence substrate affinity. In the absence of either substrate or product molecules, the active site of sIGPS(1-26) forms an hydrophobic channel that is filled with crystallographically well-defined water molecules (Figure 5). These water molecules might compete with the substrate for binding to the active site and thus also contribute to the high KM value for CdRP. In the wild-type enzyme this cavity is covered by helix R0, and some water molecules that are closer to the protein surface are displaced by the side chains of W8 and L9. The interaction of the N-terminal extension with the ( R)8barrel core of sIGPS has been analyzed on the basis of the wild-type structure. Most of these interactions are formed by hydrogen bonds, which are listed in Table 4. In addition, salt bridges are found between R3 and D165, K6 and E185, and R19 and D111 as well as R26 and D128. From these ion pairs R3/D165 and K6/E185 are observed in only one out of three different sIGPS crystal forms (19) and can therefore be classified as weak, transient interactions. In contrast, the salt bridges R19/D111 and R26/D128 seem to be highly specific and strongly supported by the molecular context (for a detailed description see refs 9 and 19). Since structural differences between the ( R)8-barrel cores of wildtype and truncated sIGPS are restricted to minor conformational rearrangements (Figure 3), it is apparent that the disruption of the hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the N-terminal extension and the core are crucial for the decreased stability of sIGPS(1-26) compared to sIGPS (Table 3). CONCLUSIONS The comparison of thermal inactivation and steady-state enzyme kinetic data of sIGPS and tIGPS with sIGPS(126) and tIGPS(1-25) shows that the N-terminal helix R0 is important for both resistance to irreversible thermal inactivation and substrate binding. These findings can be
