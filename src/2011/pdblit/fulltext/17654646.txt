Experimental Methods. Protein.Crystallography C. elegans cyclophilin 3 (Cyp3) was expressed, purified and crystallized as described
[1, 2]

. Native Cyp3 crystals (approximately 0.2 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm) were soaked in 10 µl drops of well solution (30

% poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether 5000; 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.6) containing increasing concentrations of the Xaa-Pro dipeptide. Soaking time was between 1 and 3 hours. Crystals were mounted in a 0.2 - 0.3 mm cryoloop (Hampton Research, Inc.), dipped in cryoprotectant (well solution + 20% glycerol) for a few seconds, and frozen by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100K at synchrotron radiation sources at the EMBL, Hamburg, or the SRS, Daresbury. The Cyp3 native structure model. For each crystal the following standard refinement protocol was carried out: The program REFMAC ARP_water
[4] [3] [1]

was used as a starting

was used to refine the structure water molecules added automatically using

.

Once convergence was complete the three active site water molecules were removed and the Xaa-Pro ligand was placed in the active site and further cycles of refinement were carried out using individual atom B-factor refinement. B-factors of all well ordered protein atoms within 4Å of the Xaa-cis-Pro ligand (namely 14 atoms from residues F67, Q70,A108, N109, F120 and H133) were used to estimate a B-factor which was then used as a fixed value for all ligand atoms in subsequent refinement steps. (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2) SHELX97 [5] was used in the final steps of refinement in which the doubly disordered model was defined in the following way: The coordinates of Arg62n, Arg62l, Xaa-Pro dipeptide, Wa, Wb, Wc, and Wd were fixed during occupancy refinement. Arg62n represents the Arg62 conformation in the native (free) form of Cyp3 and Arg62l represents the Arg62 conformation with Xaa-Pro dipeptide bound to Cyp3. The restraints applied in the occupancy refinement are: QArg62n + QArg62l = 1 QArg62l = Ql QArg62n = QWa = QWb = QWc = QWd Where QArg62n is the occupancy of the Arg62 conformation in the native (free) protein, QArg62l is the occupancy of the Arg62 conformation with Xaa-cis-Pro bound, and Ql is the occupancy of Xaa-cis-Pro. The B-factors of Arg62l, Arg62n, Xaa-Pro, Wa, Wb, Wc, and Wd were fixed to the same B-factor that was estimated in the final step of the REFMAC refinement. An alternative procedure using SHELX97 in which the

2

occupancy and overall ligand B-factor were refined simultaneously gave ligand occupancy values that were closely consistent with the chosen protocol. By regarding the crystal soaking experiment as a simple equilibrium in which each protein molecule in the crystal lattice can be bound or free, the ligand occupancy (Ql) is related to the dissociation constant by equation 1; Ql = (Qmax × [L]) / ([L] + Kdc) eq. 1

where Ql is the occupancy of ligand (fraction of the protein sites in the crystal occupied by ligand), Kdc is the crystal dissociation constant, [L] is the concentration of the ligand (it is assumed that the concentration of ligand in the 10 µl drop is constant throughout the soaking experiment and Qmax is the maximal fractional occupancy of the ligand at saturation (fixed at 1). Peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) assay. This colourimertic assay, performed essentially as described
[6]

,

determines the rate of the cis to trans conversion of the peptidyl-prolyl amide bond in the substrate N-succinylAla-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (AAPF-pNA). Final concentrations of Cyp3 and AAPF-pNA were 100 µM and 18.3 nM, respectively. The IC50 was determined by a least squares fit of equation 2 to plots of the initial reaction rate (background thermal isomerisation rate subtracted), Vo (in µM.s-1) versus the cis concentration of dipeptide (at equilibrium in aqueous solution the percentage of the cis-confomers are 48% for Gly-Pro, 34 % for Ala-Pro and 33% for Ser-Pro [7]). Vo = V + (Vzero - V) / {(1 + ([XcisP] / IC50) Slope)}

eq. 2

Where V is the reaction rate at infinite inhibitor concentration (fixed at 0), Vzero is the initial velocity in the absence of inhibitor, [XcisP] is the inhibitor concentration , IC50 is the inhibitor concentration that causes 50 % inhibition and Slope is the Hill number. Correction for substrate competition was preformed using equation 3; Kds = IC50 / 1 + ([AAPF] / Km)

eq. 3

where [AAPF] is the initial AAcisPF-pNA concentration and Km is the substrate Michealis constant (410 ± 76 µM). All three dipeptides do not inhibit chymotrypsin- in the nM range (data not shown), in agreement with previous data [8]. Molecular modeling. The accessible surface of the ligand molecule (SL) was calculated in isolation using an implementation of Connolly's algorithm [9] using a probe radius of 1.5 Å in the modelling program WITNOTP
[10]

. The accessible surface of the un-liganded protein molecule (SP), included the 5 common water molecules

(We ­ Wi), to define a composite protein surface. The buried surface of the ligand was calculated as (SP + SL ­ SPL), where SPL is the accessible surface area of the complex.
