Abstract Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). eIF2B is a heteropentameric protein composed of a­e subunits. The a, b, and d subunits form a regulatory subcomplex, while the c and e form a catalytic subcomplex. Archaea possess homologues of a, b, and d subunits of eIF2B. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of an archaeal regulatory subunit (aIF2Ba) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii  OT3 determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 A resolution. aIF2Ba consists of two subdomains, an N-domain (residues 1­95) and a C-domain (residues 96­276), connected by a long a-helix (a5: 78­106). The N-domain contains a five helix bundle structure, while the C-domain folds into the a=b structure, thus showing similarity to D -ribose-5-phosphate isomerase structure. The presence of two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit and the gel filtration analysis suggest a dimeric structure of aIF2Ba in solution, interacting with each other by C-domains. Furthermore, the crystallographic 3-fold symmetry generates a homohexameric structure of aIF2Ba; the interaction is primarily mediated by the long a-helix at the N-domains. This structure suggests an architecture of the three subunits, a, b, and d, in the regulatory subcomplex within eIF2B. Ó 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

heterotrimeric GTP binding protein (a, b, and c) that binds charged initiator Met-tRNAi in a GTP-dependent manner to form a stable ternary complex [4­6]. The resulting 43S preinitiation complex is thought to scan along the mRNA to locate the AUG start codon [7]. Recognition of this codon by the anticodon of the initiator Met-tRNAi triggers GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 in a reaction also requiring eIF5. eIF2 is released from the ribosome in a stable binary complex with GDP. The 60S ribosomal subunit then joins, leading to the elongation phase of protein synthesis. The binary complex eIF2GDP is inactive for binding the initiator Met-tRNAi and must be converted to eIF2-GTP to regenerate the ternary complex. This recycling process is facilitated by

the nucleotide exchange factor, termed eIF2B [8,9]. This recycling reaction from eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP is a major target of translational control by a conserved mechanism involving phosphorylation of eIF2. The eIF2 phosphorylation on Ser51 of its a subunit is a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B. As eIF2 generally occurs in excess of eIF2B, and phosphorylation of eIF2-GDP increases its affinity for eIF2B, the recycling of eIF2 can be inhibited by phosphorylation of only a fraction of eIF2 [10]. The guanine exchange factor eIF2B is composed of five subunits, a, b, c, d, and e [2]. The a, b, and d subunits which interact with eIF2 are required to sensitize eIF2B to inhibition, while the c and e subunits are involved in the catalytic function [11,12]. The largest subunit, e, contains the catalytic domain, but its assembly into the five-subunit holocomplex greatly enhances its nucleotide-exchange activity [13]. It is also known that the a, b, and d subunits share extensive sequence similarity and can form a regulatory subcomplex in the absence of the other two subunits [14]. Recently, the missense mutations in all subunits of human eIF2B are causal in the rare inherited and fatal neurodegenerative brain disorder leucoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter [15,16]. Although molecular genetic and biochemical studies on yeast provided sequence information and functional roles for each of the five subunits of eIF2B, the structure­function relationships of the subunits remained unclear as their three-dimensional structures were unknown. Archaea, a third phylogenetic kingdom of organisms, are bacteria living in extraordinary environments such as anaerobic conditions, high salt condition, high temperature or extremely acidic media [17]. Recently, the complete sequencing of several archaeal genomes became available ([18] and references therein). It has been generally accepted that various components of the translation apparatus in archaea share many sequence and functional features with eukaryotic counterparts [19,20]. In addition, proteins from thermophilic organisms are more robust and crystallize better than those of mesophilic organisms. Indeed, Archaea possess all three subunit homologues of eIF2. Three subunits in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi were overproduced in Escherichia coli cells, and their reconstitution to form a trimeric protein was reported [21]. In addition, the crystal structure of the c subunit of the P. abyssi IF2 was established: it displays significant similarities to elongation factors, such as EF-Tu [21]. Thus, information on archaeal proteins will ultimately be of help in establishing the structure and function relationships of corresponding proteins from eukaryotes. As for archaeal homologues for eIF2B, the regulatory subunits a, b, and d have been identified, although these are not specifically related to any of the three eukaryotic

subunits. In our own study on structural genomics on hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 [18], we identified three genes, PH0440, PH0702, and PH0208, with translational products of sequence similarity to the a, b, and d subunits of eIF2B, respectively. Hence, their translational products were designated as aIF2Ba, aIF2Bb, and aIF2Bd, respectively. To gain insight into the structure­function relationships of eIF2B, we attempted to crystallize the recombinant proteins, aIF2Ba, aIF2Bb, and aIF2Bd. Although no suitable crystals for aIF2Bb and aIF2Bd have heretofore been available, the aIF2Ba crystals did grow under an appropriate condition. In the present study, we determined  the crystal structure of aIF2Ba at 2.2 A resolution using the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method. The crystal structure suggests an architecture of the three subunits, a, b, and d, in the regulatory subcomplex within eIF2B.

Materials and methods
Materials. Restriction enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas. Plasmid pGEM T-vector and expression plasmid pET-22b were obtained from Promega and Novagen, respectively. E. coli strains JM109 and BL21 Codon PLus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) were used as host cells for cloning and producing recombinant protein, respectively. Reagents of the highest purity available were purchased. Preparation of aIF2Ba. The gene (ID code PH0440) encoding the P. horikoshii IF2Ba (aIF2BaÞ was PCR amplified and placed under control of the T7 phage promoter on the expression plasmid pET-22b. Expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG; as the resulting protein was found to be produced as inclusion bodies, the recombinant protein was purified as follows. The E. coli cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in 30 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 30 mM NaCl. The lysate was centrifuged at 8000g for 15 min and the pellet was collected and washed with 1 M sucrose, followed by 2% Triton X100/10 mM EDTA. The inclusion bodies thus obtained were dissolved in 30 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 30 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 8 M urea. The protein solution was dialyzed against 30 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 30 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 4 M urea for 24 h and finally against the same buffer without urea. The protein was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a HQ/M column (0.45 Â 10 cm) using BioCAD SPRINT instrument (Applied Biosystems). The adsorbed protein was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl concentration from 30 mM to 1.5 M in the buffer. In this chromatography, the protein was eluted at 0.15 M NaCl and gave a single band on SDS­PAGE (data not shown). To estimate the apparent molecular weight in solution, aIF2Ba (a final concentration of 1 mg/ ml) was loaded onto the HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, containing 30 mM NaCl, and the protein was eluted at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min at 4 °C. Crystallization and data collection. The purified protein aIF2Ba was concentrated to 6.2 mg/ml in 0.1 M Hepes­NaOH buffer (pH 7.5). Crystallization attempts were made by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C using crystal screen kits (Hampton Research) as reservoir solutions. Each drop was formed by mixing equal volumes (1:1 ll) of protein and reservoir solution. The crystals were obtained under three different conditions: (1) 35% (v/v) dioxane, (2) 10% ethanol containing 1.5 M NaCl, and (3) 0.1 M tri-sodium citrate dehydrate, pH 5.6, containing 2% (v/v) ethylene imine polymer and 0.5 M NaCl.

Y. Kakuta et al. / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 319 (2004) 725­732 Crystallization was optimized under these conditions and the best crystal was obtained from 1.5 M NaCl in one week with a size of 0.2 Â 0.2 Â 0.5 mm3 . For data collection, the crystals of aIF2Ba were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution containing 20% glycerol with saturated NaCl solution, then mounted in a nylon loop, and flashfrozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data sets for MIR experiment were collected on beamline BL40B2 at SPring-8 of Japan and high resolution native data were collected on beamline BL41XU at SPring-8, integrated, scaled, and merged using HKL2000 programs [22]. Structure determination and refinement. For crystallographic data calculation, the CNS program [23] was used. Initial heavy-atom sites of  Hg at 4 A were determined using difference Patterson maps, vector verification, and difference Fourier maps. Mercury sites were determined and verified by cross phasing. Heavy-atom positions, occupancies, B-factors, and initial phases were calculated, including the anomalous diffraction data of all two derivative data sets. The

727

refinement of all parameters and the first phases was calculated and  resulted in an overall figure of merit of 0.43 at 3.0 A resolution. The  initial 3.0 A Fourier map was improved by solvent flattening. The first secondary structure elements could be built in this map as an incomplete model. All building steps were carried out with ARP/wARP [24]. With this first model and the derivative phases, an improved phase combined Fourier map could be calculated, from which the initial amino acid side chains and thus the peptide sequence could be derived using program O [25]. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules of aIF2Ba, which are denoted as MolA and MolB. These molecules were used as the starting model for the refinement and density modification  using 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps at 2.2 A resolution of high resolution native data, which were calculated with the CNS. The rebuilding was alternated with positional refinement, simulated annealing, and positional and individual B-factor refinement of the model. After finishing the refinement of the protein model, water molecules were added, the latter automatically using CNS applications and final visual inspection.

Results and discussion During our studies of structural genomics on hyperthermophilic archaeon P. horikoshii OT3, we identified three genes, PH0440, PH0702, and PH0208, the translational products of which showed 25%, 15%, and 25% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, with those of eIF2Ba, eIF2Bb, and eIF2Bd from Saccharomyces cerevisiae; they were thus referred to as aIF2Ba, aIF2Bb, and aIF2Bd; respectively. The archaeal proteins aIF2Ba, aIF2Bb, and aIF2Bd are composed of 276, 364, and 324 amino acids, respectively, with calculated isoelectric points of 5.89, 6.43, and 7.71. As cases of eukaryotic subunits, the archaeal proteins, aIF2Ba, aIF2Bb, and aIF2Bd, share sequence similarity with each other, showing 26% (aIF2Ba and aIF2Bb), 35% (aIF2Ba and aIF2BdÞ, and 34% (aIF2Bb and aIF2BdÞ identity. As all three proteins, aIF2Ba, aIF2Bb, and aIF2Bd, were produced as inclusion bodies in E. coli cells, they were dissolved in the solution containing 8 M urea and then refolded using the dialysis method. The only protein aIF2Ba could be efficiently refolded into a native structure and purified to apparent homogeneity, as described under Materials and methods. The yield was about 6 mg/liter in induced cultures. Structure determination  The crystals of aIF2Ba diffract to 2.2 A and belong to space group P63 22, with cell dimensions a ¼ b ¼   158:4 A, c ¼ 151:5 A, and c ¼ 120°. The crystals of aIF2Ba contain two molecules (MolA and MolB) per  asymmetric unit, corresponding to a VM of 4.3 A3 /Da [26], and the calculated solvent content in the crystal is

70.0%. The statistics of data collection are summarized in Table 1. The native structure was solved by MIR using heavy-atom derivatives of K2 PtCl4 and (C2 H5 )2 Hg. The refinement steps included optimization of the weighing factors of the X-ray term and led to a final R-factor of 20.9% (Rfree 23.4%). The refined structure contains 549 residues [2­275 (MolA) and 2­276 (MolB)] and 208 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. The model has geometries close to ideal with rmsd of  0.006 A and 1.3° from ideal values for bond lengths and angles, respectively. When the structure was examined using PROCHECK [27], 94.4% of the non-glycine and non-proline residues fell in the most favored regions and 5.6% in other allowed for a region of the Ramachandran plot in both MolA and MolB. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Overall structure Fig. 1 shows the overall structure of aIF2Ba from P. horikoshii and its secondary structure elements of aIF2Ba, as defined by the DSSP program [28], are given in Fig. 2. aIF2Ba consists of two major domains: an Ndomain (residues 1­95) and a C-domain (residues 96­    276), with approximate dimensions 60 A Â 47 A Â 40 A. The N-domain is built entirely of a-helices; five closely packed a-helices are arranged in a manner similar to membrane-spanning a-helices. The chain directions of each a-helix are reversed in this folding motif. The helix bundle has the hydrophobic interior composed of residues from a-helices. It involves residues Val6, Ile9, Phe32, Leu35, Ile48, Leu51, Val55, Leu68, Phe71, Ile72, Leu81, Phe88, Leu89, and Met92. The C-domain consists of nine helices (four a-helices: a5, a6, a7, a10, and five 310 -helices: a8, a10, a11, a12, and a13) and 12 b-strands (b1­b12). The amino acid residues at the C-domain fold into the a=b structure with a five-stranded parallel b-sheet (b1, b2, b3, b4, and b7) surrounded

by five helices (a6­a10). The polypeptide chain enters the extended arm structure (residues 233­251), comprising short b strands, b8 and b9, followed by another short b strand b10. The C-terminal region is completed by two short b strands, b11 and b12, preceded by the 310 -helix (a13). Fig. 2 shows the sequence alignment of two archaeal a subunits as well as four eukaryotic a subunits. This comparison shows that the C-domain is more conserved than the N-domain, having five absolutely conserved residues, Leu123, Gly149, Leu156, Asp168, and Val183. In addition, several amino acid exchanges in the C-domain represent conservative substations. It is thus assumed that structure of the C-domain appears to be common in the eIF2Ba protein family and may play

an essential role in the structure and/or function. The two subdomains of aIF2Ba are connected by a long a-helix a5 (residues 78­106), which is the last and first helices in the N-domain and C-domain, respectively, and leads to the first b-strand b1 in the C-domain. The linker helix a5 appears to be responsible for interaction with two other molecules located in crystallographic 3-fold symmetry, as discussed below. Quaternary structure As stated above, aIF2Ba crystallizes with two molecules, MolA and MolB, in the asymmetric unit. Superposition of the two asymmetric molecules gave an rmsd

730

 of 0.51 A for 274 equivalent Ca atoms (data not shown). The closer match between two molecules may reflect the greater accuracy of their coordinates as indicated by the lower mean atomic displacement parameters. The only slight difference between the two aIF2Ba monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit occurs in the extended arm region between a12 and b10 (residues 233­ 251). The two molecules seem to interact via close contacts primarily involving segments of a-helices (a7­ a10), b3, and the long extended arm structure including

b8 and b9, as shown in Fig. 3. The molecular contacts include a hydrogen bonding interaction between side chains of Tyr145 at a7 in two molecules and b-sheet type hydrogen bond between Val165 at b3 and Arg247 at b9. In addition, the main chain (NH) and the side chain of Arg247 hydrogen bond to the side chains of Gln170 and Glu164 at b3, respectively. Furthermore, the main chain interaction of Ala169 at a8 and Gly199 at a10 appears to stabilize a contact face of the two molecules. Gel filtration analysis revealed that the solution form of aIF2Ba has a molecular weight of about 70 kDa (data not shown), which is consistent with a dimeric form. Taken together, it is suggested that the homodimer is stable in solution and represents a fundamental building block of the aIF2Ba crystals. In addition, the crystallographic 3-fold symmetry generates a homohexameric structure of aIF2Ba, as shown in Fig. 3; the interaction is primarily mediated by the long a-helix a5 in the N-domain of each molecule. Residues Arg77­Leu81, Arg84, Ala85, Phe88, Leu89, Arg91­Glu93, Ala95, Lys96, Leu99, and Ala100 at a long a-helix (a5) seem to be involved in hexameric formation with crystallographic symmetry. The a subunits share sequence similarity with the b and d subunits, and it was reported that a subunit forms the regulatory subcomplex with the b and d subunits in the absence of the catalytic subcomplex composed of c and e subunits [11,12]. As described above, aIF2Ba appears to exist in a dimeric form but it is still unknown whether archaea possess a homologue of eIF2B as homologues for eIF2Bc and eIF2Be are not available. Nevertheless, the structural organization of aIF2Ba observed in the crystals may indicate the structural arrangement of a, b, and d subunits in the regulatory subcomplex within eIF2B.

Structure similarity A search for a homologous structure was made using the VAST server [29]. The structure of the C-domain is related to the structure of D -ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (PRI) from P. horikoshii (PDB code 1LK5) [30], whereas none were detected for the N-domain except for a few other proteins with limited similarities. The monomer of PRI consists of two domains linked by a short three-stranded b sheet [30]; the first domain can be superimposed with the C-domain of aIF2Ba, giving an  rmsd value of 3.1 A for 133 residues, as shown in Fig. 4A. A structure-based sequence alignment of aIF2Ba and PRI is shown in Fig. 4B. The sequence of PRI can be aligned with that of aIF2Ba by making a long insertion between b3 and b4 compared with aIF2Ba. This insertion folds into a large protruding second domain in PRI. Although we cannot exclude that they just represent a convergent evolution to a common fold, it is likely that the genes for aIF2Ba and PRI could have evolved from an ancestral gene; the gene for aIF2Ba evolved from a fusion with the gene encoding the N-domain, while that for PRI from an insertion of the gene for the second domain. Recently, it was reported that the structure of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A (RpiA) from E. coli is similar to that of PRI from P. horikoshii [31]. We speculate that the evolutional events may have occurred on genes for the initiation factor and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase prior to divergence of three phylogenetic domains. The D -ribose-5-phosphate isomerase catalyzes the interconversion between the ribose and ribulose forms involved in the pentose phosphate cycle and in the process of photosynthesis. Crystallographic analysis of RpiA in complex with the inhibitor identified amino acids involved either in the catalysis or the substrate binding. The amino acid residues Lys7, Ser30, Thr31, and Lys125 in PRI are identified to be essential amino acids for binding of the phosphate group [31]. Examining the corresponding amino acids in aIF2Ba, the four residues are completely conserved in the primary structure of aIF2Ba as Lys96, Ser120, Thr121, and Lys222, though all residues except for Lys222 are replaced in a subunits from other organisms (Fig. 2) as well as in b and d subunits from P. horikoshii. As described above, the a, b, and d subunits form the regulatory subcomplex and each plays an important role in sensing and binding eIF2a phosphorylated at Ser51, such that a single missense mutation in any one subunit can make eIF2B insensitive to the phosphorylation event. Recently, we found that a translational product of the P. horikoshii gene (ID. PH0512) specifically phosphorylates the Ser residue at position 48 in aIF2a [32]. This finding strongly suggests the presence of an aIF2a phosphorylation pathway in archaea. In this context, it is tempting to speculate that Lys96, Ser120, Thr121, and Lys222 in

aIF2Ba may be implicated in recognition of the phosphate group at the phosphorylated Ser48 in aIF2a. A further study on aIF2Ba as well as eIF2Ba should provide support to this assumption.
