SUMMARY

I. It was found that both riboflavin-5'-monosulfate (FMS) and adenosine-5'monosulfate (AMS) compete with FAD for binding with apo-D-amino acid oxidase but not with each other, which suggests the binding of the FMN as well as the AMP moieties of the FAD molecule with the apo-protein. 2. Using FMS and AMS as indicators, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) was found to be a competitor with the FMN part of FAD. It was considered likely that the phenylamino group affects the binding point of the FMN part of FAD with the apo-protein. The dissociation constant of the apo-protein-PABA complex calculated from the competition of PABA with FAD for the protein appeared to be 7.3" lO-3 M. In the presence of AMS, this dissociation constant decreased to 2.5" IO-a M, i.e., the affinity of PABA to the protein increased, which indicates an interaction between the two binding sites. 3. p-Chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB) was found to be a competitor of the AMP moiety of FAD. This action was attributed to the binding of the SH-reactive group of PCMB with the sulfhydryl group of the apo-protein, which suggests that the AMP moiety of FAD combined with sulfhydryl group of the apo-protein. The dissociation constant of the complex of PCMB and apo-protein was calculated to be 1.6. io -7 M. In the presence of FMS, this constant decreased to 8. 5. io s M, also suggesting an interaction of the binding sites of the apo-protein.

INTRODUCTION

In order to elucidate the processes involved in the dynamic enzyme complex formation it is necessary to demonstrate th.e binding sites of apo-enzyme, coenzyme, and substrate, since these are fundamental to the mechanism of enzyme action. For the study of this subject, D-amino acid oxidase was selected as a tool. The reasons for the selection are that the apo-enzyme and coenzyme of this enzyme are instanAbbreviations: FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; FMN, flavin-5'-monophosphate; AMP, adenosine-5'-rnonophosphate; FMS, riboflavin-5'-monosulfate; AMS, adenosine-5'-monosulfate; PABA, p-aminobenzoic acid; PCMB, p-chloromercuribenzoate.

taneously dissociable and associable with a rather large dissociation constant, and that the coenzyme FAD has a characteristic physico-chemical nature. Concerning the binding of D-amino acid oxidase, previous work J '~, especially the series on the mechanism of inhibition of this enzyme a 5, provided some evidence. It has been noted by a model experiment and kinetic analysis of enzyme action ~ that the tyrosyl group of the apo-protein is responsible for the complex formation with the 3-NH group of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, which is analogous to the old yellow enzyme reported by THEORELL AND NYGAARD 6. At the same time, the phenylamino group of the benzene derivative was found to affect the binding site of the apo-protein with FAD ~, but the portion affected has not been studied. On the other hand, the importance for the enzymic activity of the sulfhydryl group in D-amino acid oxidase apo-protein has been reported by several workers 7-1° but their conclusions about the binding site of the protein-sulfhydryl group were all different. SINGER AND BARRON 7, and SINGERs suggested that the protein-sulfhydryl group might be involved directly in the binding of the substrate. FRISELL AND HELLERMAN9 concluded, however, that the enzyme-sulfhydryl group is not needed for the direct binding of the substrate, D-amino acids. KUBO et a l ) ° were of the view that the protein-sulfhydryl group binds with the 3-NH group of FAD. Thus, opinions are divided about the binding of the sulfhydryl group of the apo-protein. The indicator method previously reported for the study of the mechanism of inhibition 5 proved to be useful for solving these problems. Results obtained by kinetic analyses for the purpose of demonstrating of the bindings involved in D-amino acid oxidase are reported in this paper. A preliminary note has already appeared 11.
MATERIALS

D-Amino acid oxidase protein, free from FAD, was prepared by the method of
NEGELEIN AND BROMEL 12.

FAD was prepared by the method of YAGI e! al. 13, as described previously. FlVIS and AMS, kinetic indicators, were synthesized by the method of TAKAHASm, YAGI, AND EGAM114, and that of EGAMI AND TAKAHASHI is, respectively. DL-Alanine, PABA, and PCMB were chemically synthesized samples.
METHOD

The oxidase activity was measured as described previously z. The dissociation constant of FAD with tile apo-protein (Kf) and that of D-alaninc with the apo-protein (/£8) were calculated to be I.~.1o -7 M and 3.3" IO z M, respectively, using the equation of Miehaelis-Menten. Assuming that an inhibitor inhibits the oxidase activity in competition with the coenzyme, FAD, for the apo-protein, the reaction velocity (v) can be shown as I7

This result indicates that the inhibition is of single mechanism involving FAD. Method I was applied and the plots of I/V against Ill gave a straight line with the same intercept as that obtained by the plots of the experiment without any inhibitor, as shown in Fig. 2. From these results, it may be concluded that both FMS and AMS compete with FAD. The dissociation constant of the complex of FMS and the apoprotein, and that of AMS and the apo-protein were calculated to be 3.2" IO-5 M and 3.[" IO-a M, respectively, from the slope of Curve I and Curve I I in Fig. I, and Curve I I and Curve I I I in Fig. 2. The presence of both FMS and AMS causes the plots of Vo/V to be second-order curve, as shown by Curve I I I in Fig. I. Curve I I I shows that FMS and AMS do not compete with each other, but with the FMN and AMP part of FAD, respectively. Bv substituting the values of Vo/V into eqn. (8), K a and K 4 were calculated to be 6.6.1o .4 M and 6 . 7 . i o - 6 M , respectively. These results indicate that a positive interaction occurred between the binding portion of the apo-protein with the FMN part of FAD and that of the apo-protein with the AMP part of FAD, so that the affinity of each binding (I/K4, I/Ka) becomes five times larger than the original affinity (I/K1, I/K2).

In the presence of FMS and PABA, plots of Vo/V are on a straight line, as shown in Fig. 3, Curve II, which indicates that FMS and PABA compete with each other. On the other hand, plots of Vo/V in the presence of AMS and PABA are on a secondorder curve, as shown in Fig. 3, Curve I I I , which indicates that AMS and PABA do not compete with each other. From these results, it is concluded that PABA competes with the FMN part of FAD.

Analysis of inhibition by PCMB of the oxidase, using kinetic indicators
It was observed through spectrophotometry and fluorimetry that PCMB does not form a complex with FAD. Method I in the presence of 2.8.IO 7 M of PCMB, a rate-limiting concentration of FAD, and excess DL-alanine (o.15 M in its final concn.) gave a straight line with the intercept I/V as shown in Fig. 2, Curve V. From the slope of this line, Kip was calculated to be 1.6. IO 7M. Plots of Vo/Vagainst conch. of PCMB (Method II) were on a straight line with the intercept I, as shown in Fig. 4, Curve I. The value of Kip obtained from the slope of this line agreed with that mentioned above. Plots of Vo/V against concns, of PCMB and FMS gave a second-order curve as shown in Fig. 4, Curve II, whereas in the presence of PCMB and AMS they gave a straight line as shown in Fig. 4, Curve III. From these results, it may be concluded that PCMB combines with the apoprotein in competition with the AMP part of FAD.
DISCUSSION

It was demonstrated that both FMS and AMS compete with FAD, but not with each other. In view of their chemical structure, it is reasonable to expect that FMS and AMS would compete specifically with the FMN and AMP part of FAD, respectively, and they can he adopted as the specific kinetic indicators as already mentioned. In a previous report from this laboratory 4, it was demonstrated that PABA competes with both FAD and the substrate for D-amino oxidase protein, and that phenylamino and phenylcarboxyl groups are responsible for competitive inhibition with FAD and with the substrate, respectively. Since a large excess of the substrate was present in the reaction mixture used in the present experiments, PABA competed only with FAD and this action is attributed to its phenylamino group. As to the behaviour of the inhibitory action of PABA, kinetic analysis using indicators demonstrated that the inhibitor competes with the FMN part of FAD. In view of the chemical structure of FMN, it was assumed that the competition occurred between the phenylamixm group of PABA and the 3-NH group of the isoalloxazine ring. The inhibitory action of PCMB was also examined and it was found that PCMB competes with FAD to combine with the apo-protein, and that it competes with the AMP part of FAD. Concerning the mechanism of inhibitory action of PCMB, SINGER AND BARRON 7 reported competitive inhibition of PCMB with the substrate and they suggested the combination of the protein-sulfhydryl group with the substrate. However, the previous paper from this laboratory 4 demonstrated that the inhibitory action of benzoate or its derivatiw~s in competition with the substrate

COMPLEX FORMATION OF D-AMINO ACID O X I D A S E . I

can be attributed to their phenylcarboxyl group and that this type of inhibition is independent of other radicals in the benzene ring. Therefore, the inhibitory action of the phenylcarboxyl group of PCMB in competition with the substrate is thought to be involved in the inhibitory action of PCMB observed by SINGER AND BARRON7. On the other hand, FRISELL AND HELLERMAN reported that the inhibitory action 9 of phenylmercuric acetate is not in competition with the substrate. From these results, it m a y be considered that the competitive inhibition of PCMB with the substrate m a y be attributed to the phenylcarboxyl group of the inhibitor. As to the competition of PCMB with FAD, it m a y be attributed to its sulfhydrylreactive group, since it was made clear that the phenylcarboxyl group does not take part in the competition with FAD and that the competition of PCMB with FAD was found to be of a single mechanism. Moreover, the competition of PCMB was attributed to its competition with the AMP part of FAD as mentioned before. Thus, the conclusion deduced from the above considerations that the sulfhydryl group of D-amino acid oxidase apo-protein combines with the AMP part of FAD m a y solve the confusion 7 ~0 regarding the binding site of the sulfhydryl group of the apo-protein. From these results, it should also be noticed that the binding between FAD and the apo-protein of D-amino acid oxidase occurs at least in two portions. Furthermore, it was noticed that there is an important interaction between the binding sites of the apo-protein with FMS and AMS. The present results indicated that the attachment of AMS to the apo-protein increases the affinity of the apoprotein for FMS, and that the binding of FMS increases the affinity of the apo-protein for AMS. These positive interactions were also observed between the binding site of FMS and that of PCMB, and the binding site of AMS and that of PABA. These demonstrations of positive interaction are of special interest in the study of the combination of the apo-protein with FAD, and consequently, of the mechanism of action of this enzyme.
