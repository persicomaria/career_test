The C1 subunit of a-crustacyanin: the de novo phasing of the crystal structure of a 40 kDa homodimeric protein using the anomalous scattering from S atoms combined with direct methods
The previously unknown crystal structure of the C1 subunit of the carotenoid-binding protein -crustacyanin has been determined using the anomalous scattering available at Ê 1.77 A wavelength to determine the partial structure of the S atoms intrinsic to the native protein. The resulting `heavyatom' phases, in conjunction with near-atomic resolution Ê (dmin = 1.15 A) data, were then used to initiate successful structure determination using a direct-methods approach. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the ®rst time such a small anomalous signal ($1%) has been used to aid the determination of a macromolecular structure. As well as the structure itself, the methods used during data collection and those used in the elucidation of the sulfur `heavy-atom' partial structure are described here. As predicted, the C1 subunit adopts a tertiary structure typical of the lipocalin superfamily: an eightstranded antiparallel -barrel with a repeated +1 topology. The -barrel has a calyx shape with the two molecules in the asymmetric unit interacting in such a way that the open ends of each calyx face each other, although they do not form a single elongated pocket. A comparison of this structure with those of other members of the lipocalin superfamily has allowed speculation as to the nature of carotenoid binding by the protein.

1. Introduction
Except for the special case of metalloenzymes, the most common methods for the de novo solution of the phase problem in macromolecular crystallography (isomorphous replacement, MAD) rely on either the preparation of heavyatom derivatives or the incorporation into native sequences of modi®ed amino acids or nucleotides. When neither of these options is available, macromolecular structure determination becomes notoriously dif®cult, as the atomic resolution data currently required for ab initio direct-methods solution of the phase problem are rarely measurable for macromolecular crystals. Even when such data are available, the special nature of macromolecular crystals means that the success of direct methods is not always guaranteed. However, the vast majority of proteins and all nucleic acids contain atoms (sulfur and phosphorus, respectively) which have considerable anomalous scattering properties. Could the presence of these properties be used to derive phases without the need for incorporation of heavy atoms or the measurement of atomic resolution data? This question is not new and it has been shown that it is possible to measure data from which phases might be determined from crystals of macroActa Cryst. (2001). D57, 1230±1237

molecules at wavelengths close to the sulfur K absorption edge (Lehmann et al., 1993; Stuhrmann et al., 1997). However, this is unlikely to become commonplace: the severe absorption and radiation-damage problems encountered at such long Ê wavelengths ($5 A) are in most instances likely to prove insurmountable. A much more appealing and possibly general method would be the exploitation of the anomalous scattering properties of sulfur and phosphorus at wavelengths more commonly used for macromolecular crystallography data collection. This idea has also been addressed and it has been shown that one can solve ab initio the crystal structures of proteins such as crambin (Hendrickson & Teeter, 1981) or lysozyme (Dauter et al., 1999) by taking advantage of the anomalous Ê scattering of sulfur at 1.54 A wavelength. Given that f HH for sulfur at this wavelength is only 0.55 eÀ, the anomalous signal available is rather small and makes for dif®culties in (i) measuring anomalous differences accurately enough to determine the S-atom substructure and (ii) using the substructure as a springboard to full structure solution. However, inspired by these successes, we have solved the previously unknown crystal structure of the C1 subunit of -crustacyanin by elucidating the positions of the S atoms on Ê the unit cell using anomalous differences measured at 1.77 A wavelength and then using these to initiate the successful direct-methods phasing of the entire crystal structure. We report here our results and in particular our experimental method. The binding of astaxanthin (3,3H -dihydroxy-,-carotene4,4H -dione) by the protein -crustacyanin is responsible for the blue colouration of the carapace of the lobster Homarus gammarus. -Crustacyanin itself has a molecular weight in the region of 320 kDa, is hexadecameric and consists of eight copies of so-called -crustacyanin dimers, the formation of which is astaxanthin-dependent (Cheesman et al., 1966; Kuhn & Kuhn, 1967; Buchwald & Jencks, 1968; Quarmby et al., 1977) and which are made up of combinations of type I and II apocrustacyanin monomers. The type I apocrustacyanins are the C1, C2 and A1 proteins, while type II comprises the subunits A2 and A3. The sequences of the major member of the two families (C1, A2) are known (Keen et al., 1991a,b) with alignment (Thompson et al., 1994) of the two sequences showing them to be highly ($56%) homologous, although the actual sequence identity is only 35%. It is therefore highly likely that the type I and type II monomers adopt the same three-dimensional structure. Crystals of -crustacyanin were ®rst grown around 20 years ago, but the size of the problem was at the time deemed unfeasible. Therefore, ten years ago the emphasis was placed on targeting the individual subunits (Wright et al., 1992), crystals of which it was hoped would be more suitable for a crystallographic structure determination. Until now, this has not proved to be the case. The C1 subunit consists of 181 amino-acid residues of which six are cysteine and none are methionine. It has been classi®ed as being a member of the lipocalin superfamily of proteins that are responsible for binding small hydrophobic ligands (North, 1989). The protein crystallizes readily with a dimer in the

asymmetric unit and crystals can diffract to very high resolution (Gordon & McSweeney, unpublished data). Unfortunately, despite much effort and excellent crystal quality, the structure solution of the C1 subunit (and the homologous A1 protein, the structure of which is reported by Cianci et al., 2001) has proved recalcitrant. Although the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000) contains many crystal structures with the lipocalin fold, exhaustive molecular-replacement searches were unsuccessful. Isomorphous replacement experiments also failed and were probably hindered by the use of high concentrations of ammonium sulfate and a high pH in the crystallization medium. Thus, despite much effort suitable heavy-atom derivatives for the C1 crystals have never been found. Coupled with these dif®culties, the protein is puri®ed from lobster shells and the possibility of engineering a selenomethionine residue into the sequence did not exist. It thus seemed that structure solution using conventional techniques posed an insurmountable problem, hence our attempt to solve the structure using the anomalous signal from the S atoms.

2. Data collection
Orthorhombic crystals (space group P212121) of the C1 subunit containing a dimer (362 residues) in the asymmetric unit were grown as previously described (Wright et al., 1992). A crystal was ¯ash-frozen in a stream of gaseous nitrogen at 110 K using 30%(v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) as a cryoprotectant and mounted on beamline BM14 of the ESRF. The expected Bijvoet ratio resulting from the presence of sulfurs Ê for this system at 1.54 A wavelength (f HH 9 0.56 eÀ) is extremely small at 0.8%. Thus, to increase our chances of success Ê the wavelength was set to 1.77 A, where an f HH of $0.72 eÀ for sulfur would yield an increased Bijvoet ratio of 1.0%. Two data sets were collected from the same crystal. The ®rst Ê Ê of these was collected to 2.5 A resolution at ! = 1.77 A; 720 of data were collected in the hope that a highly redundant data set would result in extremely accurate anomalous differences being measured. No attempt was made to align the crystal and measure Bijvoet-related re¯ections on the same or even on neighbouring images. These data were integrated with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) with, at the latter stage, the hkl and hkl re¯ections in an anomalous pair being treated as separate re¯ections during both scaling and merging. Although the resulting data were of good quality, for reasons that are unclear a large number of data oscillation images around 9 = 0, 360 and 720 had individual merging R factors close to double the overall value. These images were excluded from the ®nal data set which consisted of 560 of data. Details of this are given in Table 1. As it was already known that crystals of the C1 subunit diffract to very high resolution (see above), the wavelength of Ê BM14 was then set to 0.72 A to allow a data set with Ê to be collected. The rationale behind this datadmin = 1.1 A collection strategy was to minimize any error in nonisomorphism between data sets in case any phases derived

Ê from the 2.5 A data set needed to be `transferred' to the highresolution data to allow complete solution of the structure. These high-resolution data were collected in two passes to ensure proper data completeness and were integrated with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (see Table 1 for full details). For both data sets, mean structure-factor amplitudes and anomalous differences were derived using the program TRUNCATE (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994; French & Wilson, 1978).

each of these top six sites had an adjacent peak of positive (>4') density. The distance between each of the top six sites and its neighbouring residual map density was on average Ê close to the 1.8 A SÐS distance in a disul®de bond. Hence, it Ê appears that using data with dmin = 2.6 A, the SnB search had shown up as its top six sites peaks corresponding to a single member of each of six disul®de moieties present in the asymmetric unit and that the second sulfur of each of the disul®des could then be found from the SHARP residual maps. The second set of six positions from the original 12 all re®ned in SHARP to have occupancies around 0.5 and did not have adjacent density on the residual maps. It was thought that these probably corresponded to the positions of bound sulfate ions. A second round of re®nement and phase-probability distribution calculations in SHARP was then carried out with a model for the S-atom partial structure consisting of 12 `disul®de' sulfurs and six `free' S atoms. This resulted in clean residual maps indicating a correct S-atom partial structure. The overall FOM for acentric re¯ections was 0.365 for all data Ê in the resolution range 40.0±2.5 A.

4. Phasing, model building and refinement
The electron density (Fbest, best, FOM) map calculated by SHARP was not interpretable and was clearly very biased towards the partial structure model. Moreover, use of the powerful solvent-¯attening programs DM (Cowtan, 1994) and SOLOMON (Abrahams & Leslie, 1996) did not signi®cantly improve this. Attempts to use different approaches to partial structure re®nement and phase-probability distribution calculation, such as those available in the programs MLPHARE (Otwinowski, 1991) and OASIS (Hao et al., 2000), were no more successful. It therefore seemed that with the programs currently available, the combination of a very low anomalous signal (1%) and relatively low resolution data (dmin Ê = 2.5 A) the determination of the sulfur substructure would not allow full phasing of a crystal structure.

3. Determination of S-atom partial structure
To ®nd the S-atom partial structure, the data collected at Ê ! = 1.77 A with Ihkl and Ihkl scaled and merged separately were used as input into the direct-methods program SnB (Howell et al., 2000). The difference E values (diffE) (to a maximum Ê resolution of 2.6 A) required for this were derived based on the observed anomalous differences using the program DREAR (Blessing, 1987). During this procedure, a search was carried out for a total of 12 sites (i.e. all S atoms in the protein dimer). 400 re¯ections (phases) were used to generate 6000 triplet-phase invariants with the maximum diffE set to be 5.0 and the minimum being 0.75. In order to generate a suf®cient number of re¯ections in the starting set, the minimum diffE/'(diffE) acceptable was reduced to 2.0 from the SnB default value of 3.0. 1000 trials were carried out with starting phases being derived from random atoms. `Twice baking' was not carried out and all other parameters and choices were left as the defaults provided by the program. At the end of the procedure, the distribution of the minimum function Rmin was examined for the bimodal nature that is characteristic of successful partial structure determination (Miller et al., 1994; Howell et al., 2000). As can be seen from Fig. 1, this is clearly in evidence and the top 12 sites were thus used as input for re®nement and phase-probability distribution calculation using the anomalous differences in the Ê 1.77 A wavelength data with the program SHARP (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997). Of the 12 sites input to the initial round of re®nement, the top six re®ned to yield occupancies greater than 1 (in the range 1.10±1.40). Inspection of the loglikelihood-based residual maps from SHARP revealed that

mination (see, for example, Dauter et al., 1999) is a `hard' limit that may be dif®cult to overcome. The major part of the atomic model for the protein dimer was built automatically using the program wARP (Perrakis et Ê al., 1999). Further re®nement (dmin = 1.15 A) and manual rebuilding of the model were carried out with the SHELX suite of programs (Sheldrick, 1998) and QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, USA), respectively. The ®nal

However, the availability of high-resolution data collected Ê from the same crystal as the 1.77 A wavelength data did allow us to determine the crystal structure. E values for the highresolution data were calculated for all data to a resolution Ê limit of 1.15 A [the point where hI/'(I)i for the resolution shell fell below 2.5] using the program DREAR (Blessing, 1987). Starting phases calculated from the positions of the 12 S atoms in the six disul®de bridges only were then used as a basis for phase re®nement using the program ACORN (Foadi et al., 2000). Provided that the resolution of the data was not truncated in any way, this procedure worked immediately providing electron-density maps of excellent quality (Fig. 2). The fact that even with some prior phase information directmethods procedures still required data to a resolution limit of Ê Ê 1.15 A is signi®cant, suggesting that the 1.2 A resolution limit often quoted for successful direct-methods structure deter-

model contains 361 amino-acid residues (residues 1±181 for molecule A, 2±181 for molecule B), four bound MPD moieties, two sulfate ions and 429 water molecules. Despite the high resolution of the data available, poor electron density in certain regions of the map meant that residue Asp1 in molecule B was not included in the model and that Lys61 in the same molecule was truncated to alanine. All C, N, O and S atoms in the model were re®ned with anisotropic temperature factors. H atoms were included in the re®nement procedure by generating their positions based on geometrical criteria and then allowing them to `ride' on the heavy atoms to which they are attached. The current crystallographic R factor is 15.0% for 121 722 re¯ections with F > 0 in the resolution range 40.0± Ê È 1.15 A, while the Rfree (Brunger, 1992) is 18.8% for 6420 re¯ections in the same resolution range. Full details of the results of the re®nement procedure can be found in Table 2. The quality of the ®nal model (see Table 2) was assessed using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and WHATIF (Vriend & Sander, 1993). The conformations of all the amino acids lie in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965), except for Tyr112 in both monomers. This residue is found in the Thr-Asp-Tyr -turn motif and its non-standard conformation is a feature of many lipocalin structures (Huber et al., 1987; Cowan et al., 1990; North, 1989).

5. Structure description

As expected, the structure of the C1 subunit (Fig. 3) has a characteristic lipocalin fold: an eight-stranded antiparallel -barrel with a repeated +1 topology (North, 1991). The -barrel, formed by two orthogonally arranged -sheets, forms a calyx or cup shape. The strands of the barrel are linked by a +1 connection giving a closed -sheet. There is a conserved 310 helix at the N-terminal end and a longer C-terminal helix which folds back along the barrel and packs against strands G and H. In the C1 structure, there are also extra secondarystructural elements that are not characteristic or common to all members of the lipocalin superfamily. At the N-terminus ± before the 310 helix ± there is a short -strand (residues 7±10), an extended loop and then an -helical extension to the 310 helix. At the C-terminus, strand I is followed by an additional two-turn helix near the very end of the polypeptide chain (residues 145±156). There are three disul®de bonds per monomer: Cys12±Cys121, Cys51±Cys173 and Cys117±Cys150, which link the N-terminus to strand G, strand B to the Cterminus and strand G to the C-terminal end of helix 2, Figure 4 respectively. A ribbon diagram of the C1/C1 homodimer found in the asymmetric unit. Note that the dimerization is of a `face-to-face' nature and that By analogy with the crystal structures of other members of monomer±monomer interactions occur via the N-terminal and loops the lipocalin family, the binding cavity of the C1 subunit is GH, EF and DE. Two MPD molecules shown in ball-and-stick composed predominantly of aromatic and polar residues: nine representation (carbon, grey; oxygen, red) can be seen in the two binding aromatic residues (Trp35, Tyr45, Tyr56, Tyr97, Phe101, pockets, which are almost facing one another. Phe132, Phe134, Phe136, Phe1101), nine aliphatic residues (Leu47, Ile48, Val52, Leu83, Ile95, Ala102, Ala103, Leu105, Leu118), three hydroxyl groups (Ser67, Ser100, Ser120), four amides (Gln7, Asn3, Gln46, Asn54) and two charged residues (Arg79 and Asp96). The cavities in the crystallographic dimer are closed to the solvent Ê and have a volume of 148 A3 as calculated using VOIDOO (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994) using a Ê 1.4 A probe. There are two MPD Figure 5 molecules bound per pocket, The amino-acid sequence and secondary-structure assignment of the C1 crustacyanin subunit aligned with the A2 subunit sequence using ESPrit (Gouet et al., 1999). Areas of sequence similarity are boxed with white with the interactions of these background and areas of sequence identity boxed with red background. As can be seen, the two sequences moieties and the protein being are highly homologous, suggesting they have the same overall structure, hence our hypothesis (see main mediated via water molecules. text) that the C1/C1 homodimer described here is a good model for the C1/A2 heterodimer found in crustacyanin.

pocket is characterized by the presence of Trp35, a residue that is strictly conserved in all members of the lipocalin superfamily. The C1 crystals contain a homodimer (Fig. 4) in the asymmetric unit. The two molecules lie so that the top of the cavities are packed against one another, each facing in the opposite direction. Interactions are through the N-termini and loops GH, EF and DE. A comparison of the C1 structure with a database of known protein structures carried out using the DALI server (Holm & Sander, 1995) showed that despite sequence identities of only 23 and 18%, respectively, the structures with the greatest similarity in tertiary structure were bilin binding protein Ê (BBP) (Huber et al., 1987; r.m.s. deviation of 2.6 A for 158  superimposed C positions) and pig plasma retinal binding Ê protein (RBP) (Zanotti et al., 1993; r.m.s. deviation of 2.5 A for 156 C positions). The magnitudes of these r.m.s. deviations help to explain the failure of molecular-replacement techniques in solving the crystal structure described here. The -barrel core of the protein appears to be the most strongly conserved feature, with the base of the binding pockets showing a remarkable similarity in side chains and rotamer positions despite differences in the ligand speci®cities. Assuming that the structure of the C1 subunit is very similar to that of A2 (see Fig. 5 for sequence similarities), it may be that the dimer we see in the crystal structure is a good model for the structure of the heterodimeric -crustacyanin. In common with the model of the C1/A2 heterodimer (Keen et al., 1991a,b), the dimerization in the crystal is of a near face-toface nature. However, the residues (N-termini and loops GH, EF and DE of each monomer) and secondary-structural elements found at the dimer interface are markedly different from those predicted in the model dimer, which was based on the dimer found in the crystal structure of BBP (Huber et al., 1987; Keen et al., 1991b). Examination of a van der Waals surface of the C1 dimer gives little clue as to where the two astaxanthin molecules bound to -crustacyanin might bind. However, superposition of a C1 monomer with the structures of BBP and RBP gives two possibilities as to how this might be achieved. The ®rst of these is directly analogous to the binding of retinol in the RBP structure: in each monomer one end of the astaxanthin would bind to the protein with the other end protruding away from the subunit (Fig. 6a). This is similar to the binding mode proposed in the C1/A2 model. However, differences in dimer formation between the C1 dimer crystal structure and the previously proposed model mean that in our crystal one end of each astaxanthin would be exposed to solvent, an unlikely possibility given the hydrophobic nature of astaxanthin. A second possible mode of astaxanthin binding is shown in Fig. 6(b) and is analogous to bilin binding in BBP: this results in the carotenoid spanning both molecules in the dimer, one end being buried in the pocket amd the other on the surface of the neighbouring molecule. Here, the residues involved in the binding of both ends of the astaxanthin are overwhelmingly highly conserved between the C1 and A2 subunit sequences (data not shown), which would allow for both C13A2 and
Acta Cryst. (2001). D57, 1230±1237

A23C1 ®xing of the substrate. This `dimer-spanning' binding mode sits well with observations of Keen and colleagues (Keen et al., 1991b) that astaxanthin is `much more ®rmly ®xed' in the -crustacyanin heterodimer than in either the C1 or A2 subunits alone. However, in this mode of binding, the long axes of the two astaxanthin moieties are parallel, contrary to evidence cited in Keen et al. (1991b) that they should be almost orthogonal to each other. It should be emphasized that the above speculation as to the nature of astaxanthin binding is precisely that and we await with interest the structure determination of astaxanthinbound -crustacyanin to discover exactly how the chromophore is bound.

6. Discussion
We have reported here that a very small `anomalous signal' of Ê around 1% has been measured suf®ciently accurately at 2.6 A resolution to allow the elucidation of a heavy-atom partial structure. This was in turn used to kick-start the solution of the crystal structure of a 40 kDa homodimeric protein at near-atomic resolution. SAD phase-probability distributions derived from the partial structure and the measured anomalous differences were not of suf®cient quality to allow solution of the crystal structure even in conjunction with powerful density-modi®cation procedures. The anomalous differences, however, are much smaller and available to much Ê lower resolution than for the cases of psoriasin (2.0 A; Ê Brodersen et al., 2000), lysozyme (1.5 A; Dauter et al., 1999) Ê and crambin (1.5 A; Hendrickson & Teeter, 1981) the structures of which have been solved directly from observed anomalous differences. Tests of the limit of SAD methods carried out with error-free data indicate that it should be Ê possible to solve a structure using data to 3 A resolution with an anomalous signal (Bijvoet ratio) in the region of 0.5% (Wang, 1985). However, it may be that we have inadvertently found the current practical limit for the `general method' of solution of crystal structures using anomalous differences resulting from the presence of atoms that are intrinsic to native macromolecules. Our experiments also show that the requirements for successful determination of the S-atom partial structure need not be as stringent as those used by Ê Dauter et al. (1999), who suggest that data to at least 2.2 A Ê resolution are required for this. We have used data to 2.6 A resolution and using a combination of direct methods and heavy-atom re®nement in SHARP have shown that one can `resolve' both the S atoms in a disul®de bridge. Other tests we have carried out (Micossi & Leonard, unpublished work) have Ê shown that 2.5 A data are also suf®cient to ®nd the positions of individual cysteine or methionine S atoms using this technique. We have also investigated the effect of multiplicity on the success of partial structure determination using SnB by truncating the number of images included in the data set used for partial structure determination. In all cases, using the approach outlined above, an average multiplicity of greater than 11.0 produced the correct solution. This fact, combined

proper phase distributions for a macromolecular structure using a small anomalous signal and limited data resolution. These limits appear to have been overcome in a recent publication (Lui et al., 2000) which describes the successful phasing of a 22.2 kDa structure using sulfur SAS measureÊ ments at 2.5 A resolution using the program ISAS (Wang, 1985). The signal available in the work of Lui et al. (2000) at $1.5% is somewhat larger than that used in the structure solution of the C1 subunit of crustacyanin. However, if the sulfur-phasing method is proved to be generally applicable, it could represent a watershed in macromolecular crystallography.

with the moderate resolution at which we were successful in resolving the heavy-atom partial structure, suggests that for moderately diffracting crystals one may be able to routinely solve S-atom partial structures without the need for an excessively long data-collection time. In the future, this may thus allow the routine use of S atoms as markers to facilitate protein structure building, if not for use in the full phasing of macromolecular crystal structures. We have suggested above that the limits of this technique appear to be using this substructure information to calculate
