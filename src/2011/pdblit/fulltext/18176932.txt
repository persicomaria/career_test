Figure 1 shows a random segment of the final 2Fo-Fc map. One streptavidin monomer is found in the asymmetric unit of the unit cell reported here, but the crystal actually contains streptavidin tetramers possessing 222 (D2) symmetry. The overall structure of the tetramer is very similar to that found for full-length streptavidin[13] except that in this structure, the C-terminal tail is not bound in an ordered way to the rest of the protein. Although the expressed protein contains residues 134-159, these residues

Adaptation of protein expression for small-scale screening Strains and media have previously been described.[2] Overnight pre-cultures (7.5 ml) containing antibiotics and 2% glucose were used to inoculate 50ml of cultures (without glucose) in baffled Erlenmeyer flasks. Cultures were grown for 3 hrs at 34.5 ºC in an orbital shaker (415 rpm), induced with 75 µl IPTG (0.8 M) and harvested 3hrs postinduction. Harvested cells were frozen-thawed and resuspended in 1ml of extraction buffer pH7.4 (Tris/HCl 20 mM; NaCl 100 mM, PMSF 1 mM). After addition of 10 µl of DNAase1 (10 mg/ml, from bovine pancreas; for Roche, min Switzerland), at room extracts were incubated 30-90 temperature,

microcentrifuged at 14 000 rpm (5 min), pellet re-extracted with 0.5ml extraction buffer. Pooled supernatants (approx 1.5 ml) were titrated for biotin-fluorescein binding activity in 96-well plates, from which the concentration of free streptavidin active sites was calculated.[15] Typically, 100ml of culture was sufficient for catalyses; in some cases the extracts from several 50ml cultures were pooled

Expression levels of all mutants are given in Supporting Figure 8. Description of the catalytic runs Boric Acid - Sodium Formate Mixture. Boric acid (2.10 g, 34 mmol) and sodium formate (2.72 g, 40 mmol) were dissolved in water (40 ml). The pH was adjusted to 6.25 with NaOH pellets and the solution was thoroughly degassed.

To a solution of cell extract containing the streptavidin (0.15 µmol) was added the suspension of biotin ­ sepharose (215 µl containing 125 µl wet beads; the solution contained a two-fold excess of protein with respect to the beads).

The degassed immobilized protein (337 µl suspension, 0.0337 µmol) was mixed in an eppendorf tube with the precursor complex [6-(arene)RuCl(Biot­p-L)] (4.27 µl of a 0.0395 M stock-solution in DMF, 0.169 µmol Ru) and shaked at room temperature for 10 min. The beads were centrifuged in 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes, washed three times with 200 µl boric acid - formate mixture, one time with 200 µl water and then resuspended in degassed water in a total volume of 340 µl. The boric acid - formate mixture (405 µl) and the MOPS buffer (135 µl of a 1M stock-solution, pH adjusted to 6.25) were added.

Supporting Table 2: List of mutagenic primers used for saturation mutagenesis on positions K121 and L124. Sitedirected mutagenesis was carried out using the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on the pET11b-Sav plasmid. The upper (positive) and lower (negative) primers were partially overlapping with each other and fully complementary at the mutation site. In many cases, a silent Sca1 restriction site was introduced to distinguish mutated clones from the template DNA. Note that K121X and L124X were used to make single mutants (using a wildtype DNA plasmid) and also for double-saturation mutagenesis, using a plasmid DNA template already containing the S112A mutation (for S112A/K121X, S112A/L124X double-mutants) or the S112K mutation (for S112K/K121X and S112K/L124X doublemutants).

Supporting Figure 8. Expression levels of streptavidin mutants per volume of culture. Pooled extracts from a minimum of 100 ml cultures were titrated for biotinfluorescein binding activity in 96-well plates, from which the concentration of free streptavidin active-sites was calculated, as described above.
