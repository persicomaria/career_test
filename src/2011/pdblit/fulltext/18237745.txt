Structure and control of pyridoxal phosphate dependent allosteric threonine deaminase
D Travis Gallagher1*, Gary L Gilliland1*, Gaoyi Xiao1, James Zondlo1, Kathryn E Fisher1, Diana Chinchilla1 and Edward Eisenstein1,2*
Background: Feedback inhibition of biosynthetic threonine deaminase (TD) from Escherichia coli provided one of the earliest examples of protein-based metabolic regulation. Isoleucine, the pathway end-product, and valine, the product of a parallel pathway, serve as allosteric inhibitor and activator, respectively. This enzyme is thus a useful model system for studying the structural basis of allosteric control mechanisms. Results: We report the crystal structure of TD at 2.8 Å resolution. The tetramer has 222 symmetry, with C-terminal regulatory domains projecting out from a core of catalytic PLP-containing N-terminal domains. The subunits, and especially the regulatory domains, associate extensively to form dimers, which associate less extensively to form the tetramer. Within the dimer, each monomer twists approximately 150° around a thin neck between the domains to place its catalytic domain adjacent to the regulatory domain of the other subunit. Conclusions: The structure of TD and its comparison with related structures and other data lead to the tentative identification of the regulatory binding site and revealed several implications for the allosteric mechanism. This work prepares the way for detailed structure/function studies of the complex allosteric behaviour of this enzyme.

Introduction
The enzymology of control by feedback inhibition is a well established tenet of biochemistry; metabolic regulation is achieved through variations in the activity of oligomeric allosteric enzymes arising from ligand-promoted changes in the interactions between their subunits [1]. Biosynthetic threonine deaminase from Escherichia coli (distinguished from a biodegradative threonine deaminase also present in E. coli) played a prominent role in the development of this concept, due primarily to the work of Umbarger, Changeux and colleagues [2,3]. Early work using crude cell lysates established that threonine deaminase activity was end-product inhibited by isoleucine [4­7]. Later enzymological studies provided initial experimental support for the notion that different conformations of regulatory enzymes could be stabilized by ligand binding to sites distinct from their active site [8­11]. These observations were influential to the development of the seminal two-state model of allostery [12]. Threonine deaminase (threonine dehydratase; L-threonine hydrolyase (deaminating); EC 4.2.1.16; TD) catalyzes the committed step in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms: the pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent dehydration/deamination of L-threonine (or L-serine) to 2-ketobutyrate (or pyruvate). End-product control by isoleucine and valine of the

sigmoidal ,-elimination reaction regulates carbon flow through the pathway in order to maintain a proper balance of metabolites for efficient protein synthesis. The enzyme is a tetramer of identical 514-residue chains, and contains four pyridoxal phosphate moieties [13]. This is particularly interesting as of the several hundred PLP-dependent enzymes of known sequence, TD is one of the few cooperative, feedback-regulated allosteric enzymes that utilize this versatile cofactor. Binding studies using wild type and site-specific mutants of TD have revealed four effector sites for isoleucine and valine [14,15]. These studies led to the formulation of an expanded two-state model for homotropic cooperativity in TD in which substrates and analogs possess greater affinity for the regulatory sites than for the active sites [16], suggesting that the allosteric transition from the low activity T state to the high activity R state occurs synergistically, in a progressive manner throughout the saturation curve. A fundamental goal of research on allosteric proteins is to correlate the large changes in the activity of these enzymes with changes in their structures [17,18]. TD has been crystallized under several conditions, and three forms have been characterized by X-ray diffraction [19]. In this report, a 2.8 Å resolution structure of TD is described for an unligated crystal form with a single chain in the

asymmetric unit. As high-resolution structures are essential to resolving the nature of the subunit rearrangements that are linked to allosteric transition(s), this work provides the starting point for structure/function studies of the effects of ligand binding and the complex allosteric behavior of this enzyme.

Results
Quaternary structure

The overall shape of the TD tetramer is a prolate ellipsoid (Figure 1), with three mutually perpendicular twofold axes intersecting at the center; these axes will be called p, q and r, as suggested in [20]. The four N-terminal catalytic domains form the core of the tetramer, whereas the C-terminal regulatory domains form the ends, lying along the r axis. Quaternary contacts around the r dyad are the most extensive, especially between the C-terminal regulatory domains, with a smaller area of interaction along the p dyad. There are no quaternary interactions by the q axis. The tetramer therefore appears as a `dimer of dimers' in which each subunit interacts with two other subunits along two strikingly different subunit interfaces.
Polypeptide fold and domain organization

Each of the identical subunits of TD is organized into two differently sized domains, in agreement with earlier genetic studies [21­23]. A diagram of the secondary structure topology of TD, as calculated by the program DSSP, [24] is presented in Figure 2. A larger N-terminal domain, which is referred to as the catalytic domain as it contains the essential pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, consists of residues 1­320 and comprises two distinct but similar folding units, N1 and N2. As can be seen in Figure 3, the N1 and N2 subdomains each contain a central four-stranded, parallel  sheet with flanking helices. While the N2 subdomain consists of a single contiguous zone of sequence (residues 63­153), N1 is composed of an N2-like core (residues 160­313) with an additional pair of antiparallel strands (residues 34­51) extending the  sheet to six strands. The catalytic domain is homologous (40 identities out of about 280 aligned residues [25]) to the  subunit of tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium, and the relation of the subdomains is largely as described for that enzyme [26]. This relation and homology are further described in the Discussion section. The C-terminal regulatory domain, comprising residues 321­514, folds as an eight-stranded antiparallel sheet with helices on one side, and can be divided into two similar half sheets related by approximate twofold symmetry. As can be seen in Figure 3 (see also Figure 2), each of these halfsheets has an `+ plait' folding topology [27]. In the oligomer, two regulatory domains associate extensively to form a spheroidal dimer with a diameter of about 50 Å. This pairing of C-terminal domains places the helices on the outside, with the two eight-stranded sheets close to the r dyad but separated by an intervening layer. This layer is

The quaternary and tertiary structure of the TD tetramer. Each of the four chains is shown in a distinct color. The length of the tetramer is 150 Å from top to bottom. The PLP cofactors within the catalytic Nterminal domains are shown in yellow. The C-terminal regulatory domains are at the top and bottom in this view. (Figure made using Raster3D [55,56].)

formed by residues 411­432, which connect the two + plait folding units. The zone of missing residues 481­496 is on the exterior of the domain, in a position where a helix would be expected in order to complete the second + plait motif. Figure 4 presents a C trace of one TD subunit in the context of the tetramer's symmetry axes. The catalytic and regulatory domains are connected by a thin neck-like region. This narrow neck twists about 150° around the r dyad with the result that each catalytic domain is adjacent to a regulatory domain belonging to a different subunit. This region of the structure, with its right-handed overall twist, is dominated by helix 13 (residues 323­334). Interestingly, except for contacts involving helix 13 itself, there appear to be no contacts between catalytic and regulatory domains. Helix 13 makes several van der Waals and ionic interactions with residues from the catalytic and regulatory domains, and associates closely with its r dyad symmetry mate.

Intersubunit interactions

Because cooperative ligand binding by allosteric proteins can be energetically driven by changes in the interactions between subunits, it is of interest to examine the nature of the intersubunit interactions in the unligated conformation of TD. There are three unique subunit interfaces in the tetramer. There is a relatively small region of contact relating catalytic domains about the p dyad, there is a larger, more complicated interface between catalytic domains across the r dyad, and there is an extensive set of interactions between regulatory domains, also about the r dyad axis. The subunit interface along the p dyad is made up primarily of residues from regular structure in three sections

of the polypeptide chain. Contacts include Leu17 and Leu21 from the C-terminal region of helix 1, Leu171, Gln175 and Ala178 from the C-terminal region of helix 7, and residues Leu203 and Met204 from the C-terminal region of helix 8. As can be seen in Figure 5, the area of contact is relatively small, and primarily hydrophobic in nature. The solvent accessible surface area buried at this interface is approximately 730 Å2 (calculated by the program `ms' [28]), with interaction between two symmetry-related Gln175 residues providing the chief polar contact at the interface. Strikingly, substitution of Gln175 with either glutamate or aspartate results in the dissociation of the native tetramer into fully active dimeric enzymes that retain cooperative ligand binding and feedback control (DC, DTG and EE, unpublished results).

Environment of pyridoxal phosphate and the putative active site

As TD utilizes PLP as a cofactor for the conversion of threonine to -ketobutyrate, and genetic studies have implicated several residues that contribute to catalysis [22], it is of interest to examine the environment surrounding the cofactor for clues to the substrate-binding site. The PLP is wedged snugly between the N1 and N2 folding units of the catalytic domain (Figure 8), in a site that is formed entirely by residues from a single subunit. The coenzyme is observed bound to Lys62, in agreement with previous chemical identification [16]. The cofactor is sandwiched between the sidechain of Phe61 and the mainchain of Gly241. Each of the PLP's polar substituents is coordinated by an appropriate enzyme functional group: the pyridinium nitrogen is hydrogen bonded to the sidechain of Ser315, the C3-hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the sidechain of Asn89, and the phosphate group of PLP is coordinated by mainchain amides from the tetraglycine loop (residues 188­191) at the N terminus of helix 8 (see Figure 2).
Crystal packing

TD dimer ribbon model. One chain is colored gray, while the other is colored from blue to orange to indicate the sequence of the domains as shown in Figure 2. The active site PLP cofactor (center of lower domain) and Gln175 (bottom) are shown in ball-and-stick representation. The three mutually perpendicular dyad axes are depicted and the hydrogen-bonding interaction at the p dyad, involving Gln175 (see Figure 5), is illustrated. Also labeled are the N1 and N2 subdomains of the catalytic domain. (Figure made using MOLSCRIPT [57] and Raster3D [55,56].)

The subunit interface along the r dyad of the tetramer is much more extensive and involves both the catalytic and regulatory domains. The interface between the portion of the chains that form the catalytic domain is limited to a set of sidechains close to the r axis. As can be seen in Figure 6, only the N1 subdomain is involved and there is a preponderance of positively charged sidechains. This part of the interface buries about 1100 Å 2 of surface area. In contrast to the interactions among the catalytic domains, the interface between regulatory domains is quite interdigitated, with the two adjacent chains packing tightly together. Figure 7 shows the 30 sidechains that approach within 4 Å in this portion of the interface. This is by far the most extensive domain­ domain interaction, burying about 2200 Å2 per domain and involving numerous hydrophobes.

The construction of the tetramer is unambiguous, due to its close cyclic arrangement around only one of the four unique 222 centers in the unit cell. Each monomer (the asymmetric unit) contacts two others within its tetramer, and also makes six contacts to neighboring subunits in the crystal. The crystal contacts appear weak: each of the three crystallographically unique lattice interactions involves fewer than eight residues in total. Each of these contacts is between the C-terminal domain of one tetramer and the N-terminal domain of a neighboring tetramer. There is a gap of about 15 Å between successive tetramers along the crystallographic c direction (molecular r axis), confirming the assignment of the tetramer (because each dimer contacts only one other dimer along its axis, the two contacting dimers must define the tetramer). The body-centered crystal is formed by interactions between identically oriented tetramers, where each tetramer contacts all eight of its neighbors at (x ± ½, y ± ½, z ± ½). Crystal growth and morphology have been described [19].

Discussion
The structure of tetrameric TD advances efforts to understand its mechanism of cooperative ligand binding and allosteric control, and integrates several previous observations concerning the structure and function of homologous regulatory dehydratases and other PLPdependent enzymes. Some of the earliest descriptions of the structural attributes of TD originated from studies of the sequences of representative PLP-containing enzymes, which suggested that TD would contain a fold that was similar to the  subunit

of tryptophan synthase [21­23,29,30]. Although sequence analysis suggests that a number of other PLP-dependent enzymes appear to be in the same fold type II family [31], thus far, a high-resolution structure has been available only for tryptophan synthase. The structure of TD reveals that the overall folding pattern of the N-terminal catalytic domain is indeed identical to that of the  chain of tryptophan synthase [26]. These two PLP-containing catalysts are composed of structurally similar subdomains of matching topology, and possess a virtually complete set of homologous secondary structure elements up to helix 13 (an exception is helix 9, residues 219­226, in TD). As seen previously for the two subdomains of the  subunit of tryptophan synthase, the smaller N2 subdomain in TD occurs as an extended digression from the larger N1 portion, with an N-terminal extension along the cleft between them. The C positions of the  subunit of tryptophan synthase were superimposed on the catalytic domain of TD using the program ALIGN [32]. Figure 9 shows that the majority of the secondary structure elements superimpose closely; the root mean square (rms) deviation over 277 aligned C pairs is 1.8 Å. The similarity seen between these two proteins at the chain and domain level is also apparent in their quaternary structures. The twofold axis in the 2 dimer of tryptophan synthase corresponds to the r dyad in a catalytic domain dimer of TD. The dimer interface is different for the two

proteins, however. The interface in the 2 dimer is extensive and involves both folding units, providing a broad, relatively flat surface for dimerization. On the other hand, the interface between catalytic domains of TD involves relatively few residues, contributed exclusively by the N1 subdomain. Interestingly, in both the 2 dimer and the catalytic domain dimer of TD there is an arginine sidechain involved in a close stacking interaction across the dyad axis. This type of interaction, involving Arg379 in the  subunit and Arg55 in TD, has been observed in other dimeric structures [33]. In spite of the overall similarity within the catalytic domain of TD to corresponding regions in the  chain of tryptophan synthase, there are several significant differences. A unique structural feature in tryptophan synthase is a molecular tunnel that is thought to conduct an indole intermediate, generated in the  reaction, to the  site for condensation with the PLP-bound amino acrylate [34­36]. This tunnel is formed partly by residues 260­310, which adopt an extended loop with little regular secondary structure. No such tunnel is found in TD, where the corresponding region (residues 215­250) has no resemblance or sequence homology and also forms a somewhat unstructured loop. This loop (indicated by  in Figures 2 and 8) forms one wall of the PLP-binding site and adjacent putative active-site cleft in TD. Another unusual feature of the -chain structure is that the last regular structural element,

Other sidechains are colored gray. The position of Gln175 is labeled for orientational reference only. (Figure made using Raster3D [55,56].)

helix 13, extends outwards away from the active site, appearing to jut into solution [26]. The homologous structural region in TD, residues 323­334 (helix 13), forms the neck that links the catalytic and regulatory domains. One of the interesting attributes of PLP-dependent enzymes is their versatility: a single cofactor is used for catalysis of a wide range of chemical reactions involving amino acids. It is believed that the specificity and rate increases seen for these enzymes are largely dictated by the fold and the active site microenvironment of the particular catalyst [37]. Consequently, PLP-dependent enzymes have frequently been grouped into families that catalyze similar reactions in the hope of assessing their propensity for adopting similar polypeptide folds. For example, it has been proposed that the group of PLPdependent enzymes that catalyze -replacement/elimination reactions, which includes TD and the  subunit of tryptophan synthase and has been called the  family [38] or type II [31], utilize the same overall fold [30,31,38]. Indeed, many of the residues shown in Figure 8 that are in the vicinity of the PLP in the TD structure also appear to be strongly conserved in enzymes of this family. These residues include Phe61 and Gly241, that embrace the aromatic pyridine ring, and Asn89, Ser315 and a tetraglycine loop (Gly188­Gly191) that make hydrogen bonds with the cofactor. These results strongly support the notion that the members of this family of PLP-dependent enzymes adopt a similar structural

motif around the active site, and further suggest that the family may exhibit homology at the level of tertiary and perhaps even quaternary structure. The location of the substrate-binding site has not been crystallographically determined. However, as threonine is known to displace the -amino group of Lys62 when forming a Schiff base with PLP to initiate the catalytic cycle [39], its binding site probably corresponds to a pocket adjacent to the observed PLP­Lys62 Schiff base linkage. In addition, this interpretation is supported by early genetic experiments that identified TD mutants with reduced levels of catalytic activity [22]. Four auxotrophic mutants, Lys62Glu, Ser86Gly, Trp153Tyr and Pro156Ser, involve substitutions within 10 Å of the cofactor, and suggest that they may affect activity by leading to a decrease in substrate affinity or by decreasing the rates of processing the PLP-bound catalytic intermediates. In addition to the structural similarities involving the catalytic domain, the fold of the regulatory domain of TD bears a striking resemblance to the regulatory serinebinding domain of the allosteric enzyme D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGD) [40]. Each chain of this tetrameric dehydrogenase has a C-terminal regulatory domain with a single + plait, resembling one half of the TD regulatory domain. Regulatory domains in two chains of PGD associate with twofold symmetry to form an

eight-stranded  sheet with four helices; this dimeric structural unit resembles a monomeric regulatory domain of TD. Thus, the approximate twofold symmetry in the regulatory domain of TD, represented by the pseudodyad at the top center in Figure 2, corresponds to true molecular symmetry in the regulatory domain of PGD. The similarity of the fold of the TD regulatory domain with that seen in PGD, and the fact that the reported structure of the PGD domain is ligated with its regulatory effector serine, provides a possible clue for the location of the binding site(s) for isoleucine and valine in TD. Serine is bound to the dimeric regulatory domain of PGD (at two symmetry-related sites) on the dimer interface between the sheet and helices [40,41]. As shown in Figure 10, the lower of these sites corresponds to a location near the TD neck, at the N terminus of helix 17 in TD, suggesting that residues 445­450 may be involved in effector binding. The results of TD mutation studies lend additional support to this tentative identification of a TD effector site. A previously isolated feedback-resistant mutant of TD, Leu447Phe, binds only two of the normal four molecules of isoleucine or

valine [16]. Like the single Leu447Phe mutant, double (Leu447Ala, Leu451Ala) and triple (Leu447Ala, Leu451Ala, Leu454Ala) mutants in strongly conserved helix 17 exhibit markedly altered regulatory properties. These mutants are insensitive to feedback modifiers, with immeasurably low affinities for isoleucine and valine (DC and EE, unpublished results). There are a number of unusual isoforms of TD, in particular the variants from Bacillus subtilis (PS Fink, personal communication), Sulfolobus sulfartaricus (SJ Sandler, personal communication) and Corynebacterium glutamicum, that contain only about 400 residues, but which are fully regulated, allosteric tetramers [42]. Alignments of these sequences with TD show that the homology among the isoforms is strong throughout the catalytic domain, but that the regulatory domain is only half as long as in E. coli. These analyses can now be interpreted to indicate that the variation in sequence alignment corresponds structurally to the deletion of one of the four-stranded subdomains from the regulatory domain of TD. Thus, (in a dimer) only two + plait motifs may be necessary for feedback regulation. However, it is unclear at this time how the shorter, related threonine deaminases assemble into their tetrameric quaternary structure. Either the arrangement of the regulatory domains occurs in a side-by-side manner, analogous to one chain of E. coli TD (as in PGD), or in a

The PLP sites are virtually identical; only one is shown (yellow, near middle of structure). The view direction is similar to that in Figure 8. The respective dyads are indicated by the long thin cylinders on the right (i.e. the isolated green cylinder is the TD r dyad). Most of the elements superpose closely; the greatest deviations are at the C termini and in the region that includes the N termini and the  loops (upper left; see text).

back-to-back orientation, resembling half of a dimeric regulatory unit of E. coli TD. The crystal structure of the unligated conformation of TD does not as yet yield direct information on the transitions that accompany increases in substrate affinity and activity. Indeed, the structure raises numerous questions. Does the unligated structure reported here correspond to the low activity or T state? Or, following the nomenclature for other PLP-dependent enzymes, is the structure described here the open form? Is the open form equivalent to the T state? If so, then when the active sites are occupied by substrate analogs, is TD in a `closed' form, as has been described for other PLP-dependent enzymes [43­45], and does this structure correspond to the high activity R state? In light of the observed shifts in the sigmoidal kinetics promoted by ligand binding to TD, to what extent will the two-state model apply to the allosteric conformations adopted by this enzyme? In an effort to address these questions and gain insight into

possible structural rearrangements that may result from the conversion from the low activity to high activity conformation, a comparison of the catalytic domain of TD with the structurally similar, PLP-containing  subunit of tryptophan synthase was undertaken. This qualitative analysis is facilitated by the extensive structural information available for tryptophan synthase in the absence [26] and presence of substrates and analogs [46] and various essential monovalent cations [47]. A structural transition occurs in tryptophan synthase in which the two subdomains of the  subunit close around the active site in the presence of ligands [46]. If a similar movement of homologous domains occurs when TD binds active site ligands, this level of structural reorganization would be likely to affect the local interactions about the p subunit axis and, thus, the communication between dimers that gives rise to the observed homotropic effects. Moreover, the proximity of the active site and the putative effector site to helix 13 suggests that the neck could be a focus of structural rearrangement in the

allosteric transition. In particular, the dimeric regulatory domain could rotate with respect to the core of the catalytic domain, through a change in the twist of the neck, and this could affect the accessibility of the active site and/or the open/closed status of the catalytic domain. It is possible that aspects of both of these models may account for the molecular communication among domains that gives rise to cooperative ligand binding and feedback regulation in TD. Additional biochemical and structural work will be needed to resolve these issues.

ligand-promoted domain movements in the homologous  subunit of tryptophan synthase, and the modular organization of the structural domains for catalysis and regulation in TD, suggests possible rigid-body domain rearrangements that may be involved in cooperative ligand binding and feedback regulation. Detailed structure/function studies can now be undertaken to investigate these issues and to probe the molecular basis for the allosteric transition.

Materials and methods Biological implications
Control of carbon flow into isoleucine and valine in plants and microorganisms is achieved in part by allosteric regulation of biosynthetic threonine deaminase (TD). TD catalyzes the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)dependent dehydration/deamination of threonine (and serine) to yield 2-ketobutyrate (and pyruvate) in a controlled fashion. The initial velocity of the reaction is a sigmoidal function of substrate concentration, and the sigmoidal kinetics are shifted markedly in the presence of isoleucine and valine, end-products of the pathway. Isoleucine is an allosteric inhibitor, while valine is an allosteric activator of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. TD is a tetramer of identical polypeptide chains containing 514 amino acid residues. The structure of the enzyme revealed by X-ray crystallography at 2.8 Å resolution shows that the tetramer has 222 symmetry, and that each subunit is composed of two well defined domains. The C-terminal regulatory domains project outwards from a central core of four N-terminal catalytic domains. The essential PLP cofactor is located between two lobes of the catalytic domain and identifies the active site. A number of residues surrounding the cofactor are strongly conserved in other PLP-dependent enzymes that similarly catalyze -replacement/elimination reactions, suggesting a common structural framework for this family of enzymes. The catalytic domain of TD is similar to the PLP-containing  subunit of tryptophan synthase, while the fold of the regulatory effector domain resembles that of allosteric phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. Comparison with the serine-ligated dehydrogenase structure suggests that the allosteric effector site in TD may involve helix 17. This observation is in agreement with the previous identification of mutations in helix 17 that disrupt effector binding. The catalytic and regulatory domains of TD are connected by a thin neck formed by helix 13 and its dyad mate. Strikingly, there are no contacts between the catalytic and regulatory domains except those involving helix 13, which suggests it may be a crucial structural region for the allosteric transition. Consideration of
General methods
TD was prepared as described previously [13,15] and crystallization, diffraction at pH 7.2 and data processing were as described in [19]. Single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) phase calculation utilized the PHASES suite [48] as previously described [19]. Solvent-leveled [49] SIRAS maps revealed the domain structure and enabled tracing of the chain in the N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 1­320). The SIRAS map of the C-terminal regulatory domain, however, was uninterpretable. This domain (residues 330­514) protrudes out from the catalytic domain core and appears to be inherently less well ordered. In addition, the regulatory domain contains the uranyl-binding site with its associated local nonisomorphism and Fourier artifacts.

Structure factor manipulations
When the catalytic domain had been built, it was used in a cyclic phase-refinement procedure to improve maps of the regulatory domain. The procedure, which we call iterative map recombination (IMR), was as follows. Coordinates for the catalytic domain were Fourier-transformed into structure factors representing this domain. A premise of the IMR method is that these structure factors are sufficiently accurate to enable phase improvement over the solvent-flattened SIRAS phases. Next, the envelope of the unbuilt regulatory domain was defined as a mask, and this mask was used to extract the regulatory domain region from the SIRAS map. The extracted map region was transformed into structure factors corresponding to the regulatory domain. The N-terminal catalytic domain and C-terminal regulatory domain structure factors were then scaled according to the relative sizes of the domains and vectorially added to give new estimates of the total phase. These new phases were combined with the solvent-leveled SIRAS phases to give improved phases, a new map was calculated, and the cycle was repeated. At each iteration, the same catalytic domain structure factors were used, and the same regulatory domain mask was used, but the maps in the regulatory domain region gradually improved. After ten cycles using fixed catalytic domain coordinates, the catalytic domain was refined in X-PLOR [50] using partial structure factors calculated from the regulatory domain map. The refined catalytic domain was then used in ten further IMR cycles. This process was carried out in the 10­3 Å resolution shell, resulting in significant improvements in the interpretability of the regulatory domain. As sidechains became recognizable, initially recognized sequence elements in several strands and helices were extended to include connecting loops until the entire domain was traced, with the exception of four loops, three of which were built during the refinement phase. A more detailed description of the IMR method is in preparation.

Refinement
The complete structure (both domains) was refined against 86% complete data with Rsym = 0.07 in the resolution shell 16­2.8 Å by alternating rounds of the program TNT [51] with model adjustments using the program O [52]. The initial Rcryst value was 0.36 for a model containing 3507 nonhydrogen atoms out of the protein total of 3971. Rfree was monitored [50] using 8% of the data; its value at the start of refinement was 0.43. After four rounds of positional refinement (each comprising about 40 cycles) the Rcryst and Rfree values had decreased to 0.23 and 0.35, respectively. During the model adjustments between these refinement

474

rounds, three of the four missing loops and several previously unresolved sidechains were added, bringing the atom count to 3815. At this point individual isotropic thermal parameters (B values) were refined, imposing a tight B correlation for bonded atoms (TNT weight 20.0). Although the number of reflections used in the refinement (13 356) was somewhat less than the total number of parameters refined (x,y,z and B for 3815 atoms for a total of 15 260 refined parameters), the parameter values were restrained (towards ideal geometry and B value correlation) so as to reduce the effective parameter-to-observation ratio. After two more rounds of refinement, 33 solvent molecules were added at difference map maxima with reasonable contacts to the protein. The final model lacks residues 1­4 at the N terminus and also lacks residues 481­496. This missing zone in the regulatory domain corresponds to a highly exposed connection between two  strands, where electron-density maps show the presence of the polypeptide but are insufficiently ordered to construct it. The distance between residues 480 and 497 and the extent of the intervening weak density correspond reasonably well with the number of missing residues, and there is no ambiguity about the topology or fold. The final values of Rcryst and Rfree are 0.20 and 0.34, respectively. Overall the model is of a quality consistent with other structures of its size and resolution, according to PROCHECK [53]. Rms deviations from ideal parameters are 0.020 Å for bond lengths and 2.9° for bond angles.
