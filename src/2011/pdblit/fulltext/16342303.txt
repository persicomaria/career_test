Phage display can be used as a protein-engineering tool for the selection of proteins with desirable binding properties from a library of mutants. Here we describe the application of this method for the directed evolution of Bacillus subtilis lipase A, an enzyme that has important properties for the preparation of the pharmaceutically relevant chiral compound 1,2-O-isopropylidenesn-glycerol (IPG). PCR mutagenesis with spiked oligonucleotides was employed for saturation mutagenesis of a stretch of amino acids near the active site. After expression of these mutants on bacteriophages, dual selection with (S)-(+)- and (R)-(À)-IPG stereoisomers covalently coupled to enantiomeric phosphonate suicide inhibitors (SIRAN Sc and Rc inhibitors, respectively) was used for the isolation of variants with inverted enantioselectivity. The mutants were further characterised by determination of their Michaelis­Menten parameters. The 3D structures of the Sc and Rc inhibitor­lipase complexes were determined and provided structural insight into the mechanism of enantioselectivity of the enzyme. In conclusion, we have used phage display as a fast and reproducible method for the selection of Bacillus lipase A mutant enzymes with inverted enantioselectivity.

Introduction
In pharmacotherapy, the use of enantiopure drugs is often associated with improved potency and selectivity of the compound. In addition, adverse side effects resulting from the "wrong" enantiomer are eliminated, and the production and isolation of pure enantiomers has thus become an important process in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. In particular, bacterial enzymes, such as lipases, have been widely used for the production of enantiopure intermediates and drugs, since they are capable of enantioselective hydrolysis and esterification.[1­4] Moreover, in the past decades, protein engineering has opened the opportunity to tailor enzymes with specific properties and interesting practical applications.[5] We chose to study the chiral intermediate 1,2-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol (IPG), since IPG is a starting compound in the chemical synthesis of b-adrenoceptor antagonists. Lipase A from Bacillus subtilis 168 (LipA) is of particular interest for the production of enantiopure IPG as it shows some advantageous characteristics over other lipases. It has a relatively low molecular mass (181 amino acids, 19 kDa) and it can be well expressed and engineered in Escherichia coli and B. subtilis, since it does not require specific chaperones for proper folding and secretion. Furthermore, this enzyme represents one of the few examples of a lipase that does not show interfacial activation in the presence of oil­water interfaces.[6­8] Finally, the crystal structure of B. subtilis LipA has been elucidated.[9] As in other lipases, the fold of B. subtilis LipA resembles the core of enzymes of the a/b fold hydrolases. Because of its small size and the absence of a separate lid domain, as present in the larger

lipases, B. subtilis LipA can be regarded as a minimal a/b hydrolase fold enzyme. We have already established that purified LipA can hydrolyse acetate, butyrate and caprylate esters of IPG, although hardly any enantioselective preference was observed (ee values ranging from 20.3 % to 73.2 % in favour of (À)-IPG; Table 1). Therefore, our aim was to invert and to improve the enantioselective hydrolysis of the enantiomer of interest--(S)-(+)-IPG--by B. subtilis LipA. We mutated residues 16 to 20 of the mature LipA by localised saturation PCR mutagenesis, since this region might be of particular interest for the enantioselective characteristics of this enzyme.[9] Recently it was demonstrated that LipA from B. subtilis can be functionally expressed as a fusion to the phage coat protein g3p.[10] In this study, we evaluated for the first time the use of enantiomeric phosphonate suicide inhibitors for the selection of phage-displayed LipA mutants

with inverted enantioselectivity. These phosphonates bind covalently to the active site serine of a lipase molecule, thus mimicking the conformation of the first transition state in ester hydrolysis (Scheme 1).[10, 11] Finally, the 3D structures of both enantiomers of the IPG phosphonate inhibitor bound in the lipase active site were determined and provided a structural explanation for the enantioselectivity of B. subtilis LipA.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the structure of B. subtilis LipA. The structure shows a single compact domain that consists of six b-strands in a parallel b-sheet, surrounded by five a-helices. Two a-helices are located on one side of the b-sheet, whereas the other three (including a very small ahelix consisting of only four amino acids residues) are found on the opposite side. The catalytic triad residues Ser77, His156 and Asp133 are labelled with S, H and D, respectively. The catalytic Ser77 is positioned at a very sharp turn, the so-called nucleophile elbow, between a b-strand and an a-helix. The letters N and C indicate the N and C termini, respectively. The amino acids 16­20, which have been subjected to saturation mutagenesis, are indicated in black.

Dual selection In order to develop a selection system for phage-bound LipA mutants, two transition state analogues were synthesised.[11] These phosphonates bind covalently to the active-site serine, and so mimic the conformation of the first transition state of a substrate in the active site of a lipase molecule (Scheme 1).[10, 11] These two immobilised inhibitors consisted of the substrate analogue, 1,2-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol [(+)IPG or (À)-IPG (Scheme 2 A)], a leaving group (p-nitrophenol) and a glass bead matrix connected to the phosphonate moiety through a linker (Scheme 2 D). The dual selection procedure applied is schematically represented in Figure 2. For the initial selection of all phages with a lipase fusion, selection round 1 was designed to allow specific isolation of the phages able to bind to the SIRAN Sc inhibitor. For this purpose, 8.3  1010 phages were incubated with the SIRAN Sc phosphonate inhibitor and allowed to react for 15 min. After collagenase digestion, 1.4  106 phages containing the phagemid genome (as indicated by the presence of an ampicillin resistance marker) were obtained. Those phages were propagated by infection of exponential-phase E. coli TG-1 cells. After overnight incubation, helper phages were added to produce a new phage pool containing the phagemid genome and a mixture of wild-type and fusion g3p. The next selection rounds--2, 3 and 4--were designed for the selection of enzymes with inverted enantioselectivity. We have previously established that phage-bound LipA reacts covalently with the

Results
Construction of the mutant library The LipA encoding gene (Genbank accession number M74010) was cloned in phagemid pCANTAB 5E as described previously.[10] An ApaLI restriction site was introduced at bp 27 by a silent mutation and a spiked oligonucleotide was used to construct a saturated mutant library directed towards amino acids 16 to 20 of mature LipA (Figure 1). These oligonucleotides each had about 80 % resemblance to the lipA sequence, which should theoretically yield a mutant library composed mostly of single and double mutations. Sequence analysis of 24 clones revealed that 8 % of the mutants had no amino acid mutation, whilst the percentages of singly, doubly, triply and quadruply mutated amino acids were 25 %, 42 %, 13 % and 8 %, respectively. Only 4 % of the mutants contained five mutated amino acids. After transformation of E. coli TG-1, a mutant library consisting of 5  104 colonies was obtained, which should be more than sufficient to saturate all possible single mutations at the amino acid level. E. coli TG-1, containing the mutant library, was infected with M13 KO7 helper phages to produce phage particles containing the phagemid genome and a mixture of wild-type and fusion g3p. The lipase fusion to g3p results from

Directed Evolution of Bacillus subtilis Lipase A with E. coli TG-1 cells and a new phage pool was produced. All results concerning the dual selection method are summarised in Table 2. Additionally, we also determined the initial activity of each phage pool before each phage selection round by p-nitrophenyl caprylate assay as described previously.[10] This assay revealed rather similar activities for each phage pool (e.g., approximately 0.4 U mgÀ1). After two additional selection rounds (selection rounds 3 and 4), the eluted phages were allowed to infect E. coli HB2151. As the TAG stop codon is not suppressed in this strain, soluble lipase will be secreted into the periplasm.

Note that each inhibitor is enantiopure at the chiral atom of the IPG molecule (Sc or Rc inhibitor) and racemic at the phosphorus atom (mixture of Rp and Sp inhibitor).

The specific activity and enantioselectivity towards IPG butyrate esters of 15 LipA mutants randomly chosen from selection round 4 (Scheme 2 B) were determined and compared with those of wild-type LipA (Table 3 and Figure 3). The periplasmic fraction was isolated in order to determine the enantioselectivity towards IPG butyrate, and the DNA was isolated for sequencing purposes. Eleven mutants showed enantioselectivities comparable to that of the wild-type LipA, whereas one mutant was not enantioselective at all. Sequence analysis revealed that eight of these 11 mutants contained the wild-type amino acid sequence. In this respect, it should be mentioned that, prior to the selection, sequence analysis of 24 randomly

LipA and LipAN18I were purified and their Km and kcat values for the butyrate esters of IPG were determined (Table 4). Interestingly, the kcat value of LipAN18I towards the butyrate ester of (À)-IPG was reduced (p < 0.05), but its Km value was not significantly lowered. As a consequence, LipA and LipAN18I do not have significantly different catalytic efficiencies towards the butyrate ester of (À)-IPG (p > 0.05). In contrast, the Km value of LipAN18I towards the butyrate ester of (+)-IPG was significantly lowered (p < 0.01), which was reflected in a higher catalytic efficiency. Additionally, comparison of the enantiomeric excesses (ees) in favour of (+)-IPG revealed an inversion of the enantioselectivity of LipAN18I in relation to LipA (ee value for LipAN18I = + 32.9 % and + 35.3 %; ee value for LipA = À33.3 %).

Directed Evolution of Bacillus subtilis Lipase A molecules in the asymmetric unit (molecules A and B). After refinement, the electron density for the inhibitors bound in the active site is well defined in one molecule of the asymmetric unit but slightly less well defined in the other molecule (Figure 4). Residues 12­16 in molecule B change conformation upon binding of the Sc or Rc inhibitor. In the unbound form, this loop partly closed the active site, but when the inhibitors are bound, it has the same conformation as in molecule A to make space for the inhibitor.[9] The Rc and Sc inhibitors are enantiopure at the chiral carbon atoms of their IPG groups, but are racemic at their phosphorus atoms (Rp or Sp). However, the structures of the complexes The solvent-accessible surface of LipA decreases with very similar values upon binding of either the Sc (197 2) or the Rc inhibitor (204 2). The lack of clear enantioselectivity of B. subtilis LipA is understandable from the structures, since there are no specific interactions of the protein with the covalently bound transition state mimics and both enantiomers fit equally well in the hydrophobic groove.

Discussion

In this study we have described a novel method for the directed evolution of enantioselective lipases. Its principle is based on a combination of phage display technology and a selection step based on the use of enantiomeric phosphonate inhibitors. The relationship between the 3D structure and the enantioselectivity towards the substrate of interest, IPG in our case, can be studied in detail, since we have successfully elucidated the crystal structure of B. subtilis LipA with covalently bound enantiomeric phosphonate inhibitors. Several methods for the directed evolution of hydrolases have been introduced in recent Figure 4. Final 2 FoÀFc electron densities (contoured at 1 s) of covalently bound inhibitors at Ser77 (A: Rc inhibitor years, but most were based on in molecule A, B: Rc inhibitor in molecule B, C: Sc inhibitor in molecule A, D: Sc inhibitor in molecule B). high-throughput screening and not on selection.[14­21] show that in both cases only one phosphorus enantiomer (Sp) For probing of large libraries, selection of improved variants is observed.

W. J. Quax et al. After four selection rounds, 15 mutants were characterised in detail. Strikingly, 11 mutants with enantioselectivities comparable to that of the wild-type LipA were retrieved. DNA sequencing revealed strong selection for wild-type amino acids. Interestingly, in one of the 15 mutants a TGA termination codon was observed, whilst a fully enzymatically active enzyme could still be isolated from the periplasm of those mutants. Indeed, Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a fully intact lipase (data not shown). A possible explanation for this phenomenon was provided by the fact that the TGA stop codon is not fully suppressed in this strain. Correspondingly, it is known that tryptophan is inserted at the UGA (opal) stop codon in some E. coli strains, resulting in an intact protein.[37, 38] To test this hypothesis, we have constructed the LipAF17D,F19W mutant, which contained the UGG codon (tryptophan) instead of the UGA codon (stop codon). After isolation of the periplasmic fraction of this mutant, its enantioselectivity towards IPG butyrate was determined. In fact, this mutant showed an enantiomeric excess (ee) of + 2.13 % at 31 % conversion. Besides the selection of variants with wild-type-like activities, we were able to demonstrate for two mutants that the inversion of the enantioselectivity towards IPG could be accounted for by an N18I mutation.

Directed Evolution of Bacillus subtilis Lipase A Comparison of the enantiomeric excess in favour of the IPG butyrate ester revealed an inversion of the enantioselectivity of LipAN18I relative to LipA (ee value for LipAN18I = + 32.9 % and + 35.3 %; ee value for LipA = À33.3 %). Although the changes in ee value are significant and encouraging, for practical applications the observed ees are still rather low. Several explanations can be given for the modest increase in the enantioselectivity: a) the library size spanning residues 16­20 is rather limited and mutation N18I simply is the best single mutant in this library, b) catalytic activity does not solely depend on binding of the enzyme to the substrate, but also on completion of the catalytic cycle, and c) the chiral carbon atom in IPG is relatively remote from the actual site of catalysis in the enzyme. Moreover the (À)-IPG and (+)-IPG used for selection are stereochemically not very different and so the creation of a highly enantioselective enzyme may require more rigorous modification of the enzyme, such as insertion of amino acids. With respect to (b), one may wonder whether selection for strong binding could result in the selection of inactive enzymes with impaired dissociation of the substrate. These mutants would still pass the selection process since the phages are rescued from the SIRAN beads by cleavage of the collagenase site, leaving the immobilised enzyme behind. Within the group of selected mutants, however, there was no accumulation of inactive enzymes, which implies that this is not a major hurdle in the procedure. An important prerequisite for selection on phage is the formation of correctly folded enzymes. In fact, Danielsen and colleagues have recently shown that the lipase from T. lanuginosa could be displayed on phages as a fusion to the phage coat protein g3p, but subsequent selection of improved lipase variants on suicide inhibitors failed.[28] They suggest that the complex process of folding and secretion of lipases complicates the expression in a heterologous host. In addition, the activity of T. lanuginosa lipase is enhanced in the presence of lipid­water interfaces, complicating the design of a selection protocol. LipA of B. subtilis appears to be an important exception, as this enzyme does not require a chaperone for functional phage display. Another important advantage of this lipase is the lack of a lid, enabling the characterisation of the enzyme by Michaelis­Menten kinetics. The results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate that the selected LipA mutants were fully catalytically active and therefore correctly folded. With respect to (c), an explanation can be found in the 3D structures of the covalent B. subtilis lipase­inhibitor complexes, which illustrate that the active site cleft of LipA can accommodate both IPG enantiomers equally well, and that both enantiomers have very similar binding modes. This explains why only a slight enantiopreference is observed. By replacement of the side chain of Asn18 by an isoleucine side chain, several rotamers of Ile are possible. Each of these rotamers should have too close van der Waals contacts with neighbouring amino acids (either with Leu160 (~ 2.3 ) and Ala15 (~ 2.8 ) or with His10 (~ 2.7 ) and Phe19 (~ 3.2 ), depending on the rotamer conformation), since an isoleucine has an additional branch on the Cb atom in relation to asparagine. Therefore, small local rearrangements have to occur to make space for Ile18, but the
ChemBioChem 2006, 7, 149 ­ 157

exact outcome is hard to predict. Thus, more rigorous mutations may have to be constructed to evolve LipA of B. subtilis as a highly enantioselective enzyme for the kinetic resolution of IPG esters. Our intention is therefore to focus on extending the amino acid region flanking the active site (amino acids 16­ 20 of mature LipA) through the use of small stretches of amino acid, these stretches to be selected with the aid of the 3D structures of homologues of Bacillus LipA. Ideally, a lid-like structure will thus be formed, covering the active site. Possibly, this could have a larger impact on the enantioselectivity of LipA. It is also conceivable that highly enantioselective LipA mutants may be obtained when a secondary alcohol instead of IPG (a primary alcohol) is present in the phosphonate inhibitor.

Conclusion
We have explored the feasibility of using phage display for the selection of an enantiospecific lipase, and the effect of the mutation has been explained on the basis of the 3D structures of Bacillus LipA with bound IPG inhibitors. For further improvements of the lipase more extensive alterations to the enzyme structure are required.

Plasmids, bacterial strains and media: E. coli TG-1 (supE, K12 D(lac-pro), thi, hsdD5/F', traD36, proAB, laqIq, lacZD-M15), E. coli HB2151 (K12 D(lac-pro), ara, nalr, thi/F', proAB, laqIq, lacZD-M15), helper phage M13 KO7 and pCANTAB 5E were purchased from Pharmacia (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). 2xTY medium contained: Bactotrypton (1.6 % w/v), Bacto yeast extract (1 % w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5 % w/v). As antibiotic agents, ampicillin (100 mg mLÀ1) and kanamycin (50 mg mLÀ1; Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands) were used. Mutagenesis of the lipA gene: The LipA encoding gene was cloned in the phagemid pCANTAB 5E, downstream of a modified g3p signal sequence, as described previously.[10] To introduce an ApaLI restriction site in the lipA gene, a silent mutation at base pair position 27 of the lipA gene was made by use of the oligonucleotides lipapaLI (Life Technologies, UK): 5'-CAGTCGTTATGGTGCACGGTATTGGAGGGGC-3' (ApaLI) and lipArev: 5'-TCAAGGTTTTGTTGCGGCCGCCTTCGTATTCTGGCC-3' (Eco52I). Restriction sites are indicated in bold italics. To construct the mutant library, the following primer was used (Eurosequence, Groningen, The Netherlands): 00B468a: 5'-ATGGTGCACGGTATTGGAGGGGCA576557665555878GGAATTAAGAGC-3' (ApaLI; 5 = 80 % T; 6 = 80 % A; 7 = 80 % C; 8 = 80 % G; the remaining 20 % is an equal mixture of the other three bases). Recombinant DNA procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al.[39] Plasmid DNA was prepared as described by Birnboim and Doly.[40] DNA purification was performed with a Qiaquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The library was amplified from the chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis 168 by use of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The gene fragment was digested with ApaLI and Eco52I (Pharmacia), and cloned in E. coli TG-1 into the ApaLI and Eco52I sites of the phagemid pCANTABLip-CH.[10] Prior to phage display, the constructs were se-

quenced to assess the mutation ratio. The LipAF17D,F19W mutant was constructed with the oligonucleotide F17DF19W 5'-TCCAGTCGTTATGGTGCACGGTATTGGAGGGGCATCAGACAATTGGGCGGGAATTAAGAG-3' (ApaLI) and lipArev. The gene fragment was digested with ApaLI and Eco52I and cloned in E. coli TG-1 into the ApaLI and Eco52I sites of the phagemid pCANTABLip-CH. Phage rescue: Phages were rescued as described by Drçge et al.[10] In short, helper phages were added to exponential-phase E. coli TG-1 cells (phage to bacterium ratio 30:1), followed by 16 h of growth at 28 8C in 2xTY medium. Phages were precipitated by addition of polyethylene glycol (40 % w/v) in NaCl (0.6 M). After centrifugation, the phages were resuspended in Tris HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 1 mM), and passed through a 0.45 mm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA.). The number of phage particles was determined by mixing a diluted phage suspension (150 mL, 102­108-fold) with exponential-phase E. coli TG-1 cells (150 mL). After plating and overnight growth, the number of infective phages was counted. Dual selection with enantiomeric phosphonate inhibitors: Enantiomeric phosphonate inhibitors (SIRAN Sc and Rc inhibitors) were synthesised as described by Reetz et al.[11] All selections were in assay buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8, 0.36 % v/v Triton X100 and 0.1 % w/v gum Arabic) at room temperature. Triton X100 was used to reduce the unspecific. For selection round 1, the SIRAN Sc inhibitor (10 mg, loading 10 mmol inhibitor per g SIRAN) was washed twice for 10 min with assay buffer (500 mL). Note that the inhibitor does not dissolve in this solution. The reaction mixture was vertically rotated during incubation. Subsequently, lipase-expressing phages were added and allowed to react for 15 min. The supernatant was then removed and the inhibitor was washed eight times for 10 min to remove all unbound and unspecifically bound phages. Afterwards, collagenase A (0.1 % w/v, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was added (1 hour incubation at 37 8C) to elute the bound phages. The total number of phages in each fraction was determined by phage counting. The phagemids were propagated by mixing the phages with exponential-phase E. coli TG-1 cells (phage/bacterium ratio 30:1). After overnight growth, phagesexpressing lipase can be produced as described above. Subsequently, the SIRAN Rc and Sc inhibitors (10 mg) were washed separately. Lipase-expressing phages from round 1 were added to the SIRAN Rc inhibitor and allowed to react for 15 min (selection round 2). The supernatant was then isolated and incubated on the SIRAN Sc inhibitor. After 5 min, the supernatant was removed and the inhibitor was washed eight times for 10 min. Afterwards, collagenase A (0.1 % w/v) was added to elute the bound phages. The total number of phages in each fraction was determined by phage counting. The phagemids were propagated by use of E. coli TG-1 cells and, after overnight growth, lipase-expressing phages were produced as described above. This procedure was repeated another two times (selection rounds 3 and 4). After the fourth round of selection, the eluted phages were incubated with exponentialphase E. coli HB2151 for isolation of lipase from the periplasm. Isolation of the periplasmic fraction: E. coli HB2151 was grown in 50 mL tubes containing 2xTY medium (10 mL), ampicillin and isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mM). The tubes were incubated at 37 8C at 250 rpm for 16 h. The OD600 was recorded and the cells were harvested and resuspended in Tris HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4). After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in buffer containing Tris HCl (200 mL, 10 mM, pH 8.0), sucrose (25 % w/v), EDTA (2 mM) and lysozyme (0.5 mg mLÀ1, Sigma­Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). After incubation on ice for 20 min, buffer containing Tris HCl (50 mL, 10 mM, pH 8.0), sucrose (20 % w/v) and MgCl2 (125 mM) was added. The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant, containing the periplasmic fraction, was isolated and used as the enzyme solution in the IPG ester assay. The protein content of this fraction was determined by performing a Bradford assay in triplicate with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois, USA). 1,2-O-Isopropylidene-sn-glycerol ester assay: Periplasmic fractions were diluted with MOPS buffer (0.07 M, pH 7.5), containing BSA (0.2 % w/v), to a final volume of 100 mL. References were diluted correspondingly, but contained no enzyme solution. The esters of IPG (1 mM) were dissolved in MOPS buffer (10 mL, 0.07 M, pH 7.5), containing Tween 80 (14.3 % w/v), and diluted to 50 mL with MOPS buffer (0.07 M, pH 7.5). The substrate solution (500 mL) was added to the enzyme solution and the final mixture was incubated in a water bath at 32 8C. After incubation, saturated NaCl solution (500 mL) and internal standard solution (10 mL, racemic hex-3-en-1ol, 5 mg mLÀ1 assay buffer) were added to the sample solution and the aqueous solution was extracted twice with ethyl acetate (1 mL). GC analysis was performed as described by Drçge et al.[41] One unit (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyses 1 mmol IPG ester per minute. Enantiomeric excesses (ees) were calculated as described by Chen et al. and were defined as the ability of the enzyme to distinguish between enantiomers.[42] All data were expressed as mean Æ SEM. The statistical significance of differences was tested at a significance level of p < 0.05 by a twotailed Student's t-test. Enzyme purification and characterisation: E. coli HB2151 was grown for 16 h at 37 8C in 2xTY medium (1 L) supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg mLÀ1) and IPTG (1 mM). The periplasmic fraction was isolated as described above. Histidine-tagged LipA was purified on an immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) resin (Talon, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (0.5 M in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7, containing 0.2 M NaCl). LipAN18I was purified as described by Lesuisse et al.[8] Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data from Eadie­Hofstee plots. The mean and SEM values of four measurements were calculated. The kcat was calculated from the theoretical molecular mass of the his-tagged enzyme (21 kDa). Binding of Rc or Sc inhibitors to crystallised lipase A: Crystals were grown by vapour diffusion in hanging drops, containing B. subtilis LipA solution (3 mL, 6 mg mLÀ1) and reservoir solution (3 mL, 35 % PEG4000, 0.1 M ethanolamine, pH 10.0, 20 mM Na2SO4 and 3 mM CdCl2).[9] The crystals were transferred to a 10 mL sitting drop with PEG4000 (45 %), ethanolamine (0.1 M, pH 10.0), and Na2SO4 (20 mM) in equilibrium with the same solution. The pH was lowered stepwise once every 15 min to pH 7.5 by removal of most of the liquid surrounding the crystal, followed by the addition of a similar solution of 0.5 unit lower pH. At pH 8.5 the buffer was replaced by triethanolamine (100 mM) as an additional step. Finally, washing at pH 7.5 was performed twice. The phosphonate inhibitor (either Rc or Sc, 1 mL) was added to the final drop (10 mL). These phosphonate inhibitors form small oil drops on the surface of the drops containing the crystals. After 65 h the crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until data collection. X-ray data collection and refinement: The data collection statistics are given in Table 5. The data were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK.[43] Reduction to structure factor amplitudes was performed with TRUNCATE.[44] The B. subtilis LipA structure (PDB code 1I6W) was rigid-body refined by CNS with both molecules in the asymmetric unit as separate bodies, without

water molecules and Cd2 + ion.[45] One round of simulated annealing was performed and the electron density at the active site was inspected. In both cases (Rc and Sc inhibitors) both molecules in the asymmetric unit clearly showed additional density extending from Ser77 (PDB codes 1R4Z and 1R5O for the Rc and Sc inhibitor, respectively). The electron density also showed a change of conformation of residues 10 to 15 in molecule B. The phosphonate inhibitors were built in the electron density and the loop of residues 10 to 15 in molecule B was rebuilt to fit the electron density. The structure was refined with CNS and water molecules were added. The refinement statistics are listed in Table 5. The solvent-accessible surfaces were calculated with AREAIMOL from the CCP4 package.[45, 46]
