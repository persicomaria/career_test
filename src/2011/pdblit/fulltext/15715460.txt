A miniaturized thermal denaturation assay was used to screen chemical libraries, resulting in the discovery of a novel series of benzodiazepinedione antagonists of the HDM2-p53 interaction. The X-ray crystal structure of improved antagonists bound to HDM2 reveals their R-helix mimetic properties. These optimized molecules increase the transcription of p53 target genes and decrease proliferation of tumor cells expressing wild-type p53.

The p53 tumor suppressor plays a key role in regulating cell cycle progression, as evidenced by the high frequency of p53 mutations in neoplasia.1 p53 is a transcription factor that regulates genes that can induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In human cells, p53 activity is normally modulated by HDM2, the homologue of murine MDM2. HDM2 binds to and blocks the p53 transactivation domain, preventing the transcription of p53 target genes. Both p53 and HDM2 are covalently modified in response to cell stress, resulting in their dissociation. This disruption of the HDM2-p53 interaction can be mimicked by neutralizing antibodies,2 p53 peptides,3 or protein fusions4,5 and leads to p53 stabilization and control of proliferation. Additionally, antisense HDM2 oligonucleotides increase both p53 levels and activity by reducing HDM2 protein levels.6 The crystal structure of the HDM2 N-terminal domain bound to a p53 peptide7 revealed that this association is driven largely by three amino acid side chains in close

proximity to each other on one face of a helix, raising the expectation that a small molecule antagonist might be found that could mimic this interaction and accomplish similar disruption and cellular sequelae. Such a molecule would be expected to have therapeutic potential for the estimated 7% of human tumors that overexpress HDM2,8 as well as the 50% of tumors that express wild type (wt) p53. Low-molecular weight antagonists of HDM2 have been reported, but many of these molecules have had low potency and limited characterization of their cellular activity.9-11 Most recently, a report describing compounds with good potency and in vivo activity also provided structural data demonstrating that these compounds bind HDM2 in the same pocket as the p53 helix.12 We describe here the discovery and characterization of small molecules of a different chemotype that bind to HDM2 with high affinity resulting in functional agonism of p53 in cells. Compound libraries designed using Directed Diversity software13-15 were synthesized using standard combinatorial chemistry methods. More than 338 000 compounds were screened for HDM2 binding using a miniaturized affinity-based screening assay, named ThermoFluor.16 The ThermoFluor instrument uses fluorescent dyes to monitor protein unfolding as a function of temperature, allowing the detection of compound binding to target proteins by measuring the resultant increase in thermal stability. This is quantified as the change in midpoint transition temperature (Tm) in the presence of the compound at a single concentration.16 The protein used in these experiments, glycine-HDM2 residues 17-125, comprises a minimal N-terminal p53 binding domain.7 That the ThermoFluor assay is a sensitive measure of binding affinity for HDM2 is verified by the shift in Tm on addition of peptides known to bind to HDM2,17,18 with higher affinity peptides generating larger shifts (Figure S1). On the basis of a statistical analysis of ThermoFluorgenerated melting curves, 1216 compounds were selected for further characterization. Included in this group were 116 compounds (Tm 1.0- 4.9 °C) from a benzodiazepinedione (BDP) library, an example of which is shown in Figure 1A. The BDPs have two chiral centers and were screened as mixtures of four stereoisomers. The selected compounds were tested using a fluorescent peptide displacement (FP) assay designed to detect specific inhibitors of the p53-HDM2 interaction, and the most active BDPs were used as guides for synthetic elaboration.19 The more active pair of enantiomers from an optimized analogue were separated using chiral chromatography, and their divergent affinities confirm the stereospecificity of binding (Figure 1B). To understand the molecular details of BDP binding by HDM2, we determined crystal structures of HDM2 with various peptides and small molecules occupying the p53 binding pocket. We solved the structures of two in a series of optimized peptides reported to have affinities that decreased with peptide length18 to determine if the HDM2 binding site changed with inhibitor

affinity and/or size. The structures of HDM2 bound to a 12mer (MPRFMDYWEGLN, data not shown) and a 9mer20 (RFMDYWEGL, Figure 1D) were very similar to the reported HDM2-p53 15mer complex.7 The ordered main chain atoms (N, CR, C , C, O) of corresponding HDM2 residues superimposed with an RMSD of less than 1 Å. The buried surface area decreased with peptide length from 1493 Å2 to 1207 Å2 and 1073 Å2 for the 15mer, 12mer, and 9mer peptides, respectively. Crystallization trials using BDPs in combination with a series of engineered HDM2 proteins that varied in length lead to the identification of a set of reagents and conditions that consistently yielded diffraction quality crystals. A 2.7 Å crystal structure of 1 bound to HDM221 was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of the HDM2-9mer complex as a search model. The salient features of the interaction of 1 with HDM2 are depicted in Figures 1C and 1D. The binding cleft of HDM2 is predominantly hydrophobic,7 and the inhibitor occupies the same pockets as the peptide side chains Phe 19, Trp 23, and Leu 26. The HDM2 interactions with the inhibitor are, like the bound peptides, largely nonspecific van der Waals contacts. The compound makes hydrogen bonds to three water molecules (Figure 1C) observed also in other HDM2BDP cocrystal structures (data not shown), but none to the protein. These water molecules hydrogen bond to a diazepine ring carbonyl that can be removed without substantially affecting the affinity,19 and to a diazepine ring nitrogen that can be alkylated, again without affecting potency (manuscript in preparation), suggesting that the bound waters do not contribute substan-

tially to the affinity of the BDPs. The antagonist buries roughly 25% less exposed surface area in the p53 binding pocket (804 Å2) than the area buried by the smallest peptide. As shown in Figure 1D, the bound conformation of 1 is amphipathic, similar to the p53 peptide. The bound BDP projects pendant groups that orient themselves such that they mimic the position of the hydrophobic side chains on one face of the helical p53 peptide ligand and thus acts as an R-helix mimetic. The discovery of small synthetic molecules that mimic one or more turns of an R-helix has been a significant research challenge.22-24 To our knowledge, this is the first report of a benzodiazepinedione acting as an R-helix mimetic, suggesting the possible utility of this scaffold in the design of inhibitors of related targets. Interestingly, the structure of the binding pocket, defined as any HDM2 residue within 4 Å of any atom of 1 (G16, S17, L54, L57, G58, I61, M62, Y67, Q72, F91, V93, H96, I99, Y100), varies little from that observed in the 9mer peptide complex. In contrast, NMR studies reveal global conformational changes in HDM2 on ligand binding.9,25,26 We have generated cocrystal structures of the S,S enantiomer and HDM2 from racemic mixtures of similar compounds (data not shown), demonstrating that the HDM2 protein selectively binds the active enantiomer. However, the compounds with IC50s greater than 1 µM in the FP assay failed to produce cocrystals. These data suggest that different tight binding ligands induce a single stable HDM2 conformation. To determine the activity of HDM2 antagonists on intact cells, JAR choriocarcinoma cells, which overex-

press p53 and HDM2, were treated with 1. HDM2 has three roles in association with p53: it inhibits p53directed transcription, it is itself transcribed, and, as an ubiquitin ligase, it targets p53 for degradation. 1 exhibits an HDM2 antagonist profile in JAR cells: it induces a dose dependent stabilization of p53 protein and an increase in the target genes p21 and HDM2 (Figure 2A). These data support the hypothesis that blocking the binding of HDM2 to p53 renders p53 transcriptionally competent. Induction of p53 target genes is associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. JAR cells treated with 1 exhibit the expected decrease in proliferation, as measured by incorporation of BrdU, with an IC50 of 30 µM (Figure 2B). Cells lacking a functional p53 are predicted to be insensitive to HDM2 antagonists, as was observed for the p53 mutant breast carcinoma cell line MDA MB231 (Figure 2B). The inactive enantiomer, 2, is not effective at suppressing growth in either p53 wild type or mutant cell lines (Figure 2B). These results strongly support the conclusion that the antiproliferative activities of 1 are mechanistically related to disruption of the HDM2-p53 interaction. Modulation of protein-protein interactions with small molecule antagonists provides an opportunity for intervention in a wide variety of cellular processes. Success in the development of such antagonists as drugs has so far been limited, although interest in the field is accelerating the pace of the discovery of candidate compounds.22 Unlike screening assays that monitor the competitive binding of compounds and custom reporter ligands, the ThermoFluor instrument uses generic fluorescent dyes to monitor protein unfolding as a function of temperature, allowing the detection of compound binding to target proteins by measuring the

resultant increase in thermal stability. As an affinitybased screen, it requires no specific knowledge of the protein and in principle can be used to discover biologically active compounds that bind to orphan proteins of unknown function. For the HDM2 screen described here, the compounds that produced significant shifts in the melting temperature were tested for site specificity in a fluorescent peptide displacement assay. The identification and optimization of screening hits that antagonize the binding of the HDM2 protein to p53 demonstrates the utility of using ThermoFluor as a screening tool for protein-protein interactions. The initial structural characterization of the HDM2p53 peptide complex revealed a binding site that seemed attractive from the viewpoint of small molecule drug discovery.7 Our results, and those recently reported by another group,12 provide structural confirmation that synthetic small molecules that have drug-like properties and that compete with p53 for binding to HDM2 can be found and optimized. With respect to the general goal of discovering small molecule antagonists of protein-protein interactions, it is encouraging to discover that multiple chemical classes of small molecule HDM2 ligands bind competitively at the p53 binding site. The BDPs described here induce p53 target genes in cultured tumor cells and decrease proliferation. The HDM2-BDP cocrystal structure should aid in the design of HDM2 antagonists with improved potency and pharmacological properties that may be therapeutically useful in treating tumors by enhancing the activity of endogenous p53.
