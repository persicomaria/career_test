Effects of amino acid substitutions at four fully buried sites of the ubiquitin molecule on the thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, Gibbs energy) of unfolding were evaluated experimentally using differential scanning calorimetry. The same set of substitutions has been incorporated at each of four sites. These substitutions have been designed to perturb packing (van der Waals) interactions, hydration, and/or hydrogen bonding. From the analysis of the thermodynamic parameters for these ubiquitin variants we conclude that: (i) packing of non-polar groups in the protein interior is favorable and is largely defined by a favorable enthalpy of van der Waals interactions. The removal of one methylene group from the protein interior will destabilize a protein by , 5 kJ/mol, and will decrease the enthalpy of a protein by 12 kJ/mol. (ii) Burial of polar groups in the nonpolar interior of a protein is highly destabilizing, and the degree of destabilization depends on the relative polarity of this group. For example, burial of Thr side-chain in the non-polar interior will be less destabilizing than burial of Asn side-chain. This decrease in stability is defined by a large enthalpy of dehydration of polar groups upon burial. (iii) The destabilizing effect of dehydration of polar groups upon burial can be compensated if these buried polar groups form hydrogen bonding. The enthalpy of this hydrogen bonding will compensate for the unfavorable dehydration energy and as a result the effect will be energetically neutral or even slightly stabilizing.

Introduction
Understanding the detailed energy balance of the forces involved in stabilization of the native protein structure represents an important aspect of structural biology. One of the most promising experimental approaches is the study of the effects of small perturbations in the chemical structure of a protein on the stability of the molecule. These perturbations can be introduced by chemical modification1 ­ 3 or by site-directed mutagenesis.4 ­ 8 Chemical modifications allow an investigator to introduce any required changes in the chemical structure, but often are technically quite difficult and require development of specific methods or

approaches.1,9 ­ 12 Site-directed mutagenesis on the other hand is technically relatively easy and straightforward; however, the investigator is limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acid residues. Analysis of the effects of amino acid substitutions on the stability of proteins started in the mid 1970s and clearly remarkable progress has been achieved.8,13 ­ 16 Nevertheless, numerous issues remain to be resolved. For example, most studies of the stability of mutant proteins concentrated on evaluation of the Gibbs energy of unfolding, a parameter that provides a measure of thermodynamic stability of the protein molecule. However, the Gibbs energy, DG, consists of two terms describing the enthalpic, DH, and entropic, 2 TDS, contribution, i.e. DG ¼ DH 2 TDS: The enthalpic and entropic contributions for a given system appear to have an intimate relationship, the so-called enthalpy/entropy compensation.17 ­ 22 In some cases the enthalpy/entropy compensation is so

significant that it can obscure the occurrence of the changes in a system, if the analysis is done only in terms of Gibbs energy. For example, Makhatadze et al.,23 have shown that the protein stability in heavy water (2H2O) appears to be very similar to the stability of a protein in light water (H2O), yet the differences between the changes in the enthalpy and entropy are very significant (up to 70 kJ/mol and 200 J/(mol K), respectively). This indicates dramatic differences in the behavior of

the system in these two relatively similar solvents. Several other open questions are related to the fundamental role of different interactions in determining protein stability: the role of packing interactions for protein stability and energetic cost of burial of polar groups in the protein interior are just few to be mentioned. Therefore, we initiated a study of the effects of various amino acid substitutions on the stability of a model protein, the ubiquitin molecule. The first novelty of the present work is that we evaluate the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein stability not only it terms of Gibbs energy, DG, but also enthalpy, DH, and thus entropy, DS, by taking advantage of the high sensitivity of current differential scanning calorimeters (DSC). The second novelty of the present study is that the same set of amino acid substitutions was introduced at several pre-selected fully buried sites in the sequence of ubiquitin molecule. By doing this we assume that if the results are qualitatively independent of the substitution site, the changes in thermodynamic parameters are qualitatively associated with the changes in the properties of the native state and not with the changes in the structure of the unfolded state ensemble. The third novelty of this study is that the substitutions were made with residues that vary in size (e.g. V5A, V17A, L67A), hydrogen bonding ability (e.g. Q41V, Q41L, Q41N, Q41T, Q41S), and hydrophobicity (e.g. V5T, V17T, V5N, V17N, L67N, L67T, L67S). In total 15 amino acid substitutions have been designed that introduce changes in size (disruption of packing interactions) or polarity (change in hydration and/or hydrogen bonding). Stabilities of these variants of ubiquitin were measured using DSC and the changes in Gibbs energy and enthalpy of unfolding have been analyzed. We show that large-to-small non-polar amino acid substitutions lead to a decrease in stability, which is largely defined by a

decrease in the enthalpy due to the loss of packing interactions. We also show that burial of a polar group in a non-polar environment is very destabilizing unless the buried polar group can form hydrogen bonding in the protein interior, and that this destabilization is largely due to the large enthalpy of dehydration of polar groups.

Thermodynamic parameters derived from the DSC experiments Figure 2 shows the dependences of the transition temperature (Tm) on pH for all amino acid substitutions studied at four fully buried sites of the ubiquitin molecule. The changes in transition temperature as a function of pH for different ubiquitin variants are very similar, indicating that the amino acid substitutions did not have a significant effect on the titration properties of the ubiquitin variants.24 ­ 27 It is notable that there are dramatic differences in the effects of amino acid substitutions on Tm ranging from no changes to a decrease in the transition temperature by 34 8C. Figure 3 presents the dependence of the enthalpy of unfolding (DHcal) on the transition temperature. Large variations in the slope and in the absolute values of the enthalpies are observed. The differences in the slope indicate that there is difference in the heat capacity change upon unfolding, DCp, in different ubiquitin variants. These changes are in the direction predicted by the data of the model compound study and have been discussed by us.28 The difference in the absolute values of enthalpies

for different variants is also remarkable, indicating that amino acid substitutions have a significant effect on the enthalpy of unfolding. The observed changes (decrease) in enthalpy of unfolding are large (Table 1). In some cases single amino acid substitution leads to a decrease of enthalpy of unfolding by almost 50% (e.g. DDH(V5NWT) ¼ 2 100 kJ/mol) compared to the for the enthalpy of the unfolding of the wild-type protein at the same temperature (DH(WT) ¼ 200 kJ/mol). The calculated changes in the Gibbs energy of unfolding of different ubiquitin variants at 50 8C as a function of pH are presented in Figure 4. The reference temperature of 50 8C was chosen because it represents an average transition temperature of all variants and thus minimizes the error of extrapolation from the transition temperature to the reference temperature. Table 1 and Figures 5 and 6 compare the relative changes in enthalpy (DDH ) and Gibbs energy (DDG ) upon amino acid substitutions at positions 5, 17, 67 and 41 of the ubiquitin molecule. It is clear that the decrease in DDG is in

all cases defined by a large decrease in the enthalpy of unfolding, DDH, thus leading to conclusion that the observed destabilization is largely enthalpic. Interestingly, the decrease in enthalpy is always larger than the decrease in DDG, indicating that the changes in entropic term (2 TDDS ) upon substitutions are favorable (see Table 1). This favorable relative changes in 2 TDDS are probably related to the difference in the hydration, to the difference in configuration entropies of different side-chains, and to the changes in the mobility of the residues in the vicinity of the substitution site. Comparison with the stability data reported for other protein systems The changes in Gibbs energy (but not the enthalpies!) upon some of the substitutions of similar character in other protein systems have been characterized (see Table 2). Close comparison with these data provide support that the observations and conclusions derived from our experimental

data are not limited to the ubiquitin molecule but can be applied to the analysis of the effects of amino acid substitutions at any fully buried site of any globular protein. The effects of Val to Ala substitutions on protein stability have been studied in a large number of proteins (Table 2). The changes in stability at two positions of ubiquitin molecule are 2 12.5 kJ/mol (V5A) and 2 8.3 kJ/mol (V17A). These numbers are comparable to the data obtained on other protein systems (average DDG ¼ 2 12.1(^ 3.3) kJ/ mol). The amino acid substitution of Leu to Ala at position 67 of ubiquitin leads to a decrease in stability by 11.8 kJ/mol. This decrease in DDG is comparable with the changes in stability upon Leu to Ala substitutions in other proteins (average The observed DDG ¼ 2 14.2(^ 4.2) kJ/mol). changes in stability of two ubiquitin variants relative to the wild-type Val to Thr substitutions are 2 15.6 kJ/mol (V5T) and 2 7.9 kJ/mol (V17T), which is comparable with the decrease in stability upon Val to Thr substitutions in a number of other proteins (average DDG ¼ 2 11.3(^ 3.7) kJ/mol). The effect of Leu to Thr substitutions on protein stability was examined only in three cases but in all of them the decrease in stability of ubiquitin is similar to that obtained for other proteins. Unfortunately, we were unable to find any data on the effects of Val or Leu to Asn and Gln to Leu, Val, Asn, Thr, Ser substitutions on the protein stability. The overall trend in all these changes in stability upon amino acid substitutions is clear: independent of the model protein system studied the effects are qualitatively very similar. Nevertheless, the absolute values of DDG vary appreciably, which is probably related to the differences in the local environment such as type of secondary structure, the volume that a given residue occupies in these structures, and polarity of the milieu.

Discussion
Before discussing the effects of the amino acid substitutions on the stability of the ubiquitin molecule, comments on structure must be made. This is particularly important because detailed

structural information on these ubiquitin variants is not available. Three different scenarios of the effects of substitutions on structure can be envisioned. In the first scenario, amino acid substitution leads to a large conformational change throughout the structure of the molecule. Vast amount of structural data on various mutants, available from Matthews group,29 ­ 31 and more recently from Fersht,32 ­ 35 Yutani,36 ­ 42 Pace43 ­ 45 and Lattman46 ­ 50 groups, suggests that single site amino acid substitutions do not affect the global structure of proteins. For example, Brian Matthews in his 1993 review31 states that "...experience has shown that mutant proteins usually retain overall structures that are very similar to those of their wild-type parents." Clearly this is the case with the ubiquitin variants discussed here. As we have shown using NMR spectroscopy,28 the HSQC spectra of the variants are very similar to the wild-type protein, thus indicating that at least the global structural properties of the variants are similar. In the second scenario, the amino acid substitutions will have effects only on the structure in the vicinity of the substitution site. Circular dichroism spectroscopy obviously does not have enough resolution to provide information. The HSQC experiments usually do not provide any details of such conformational changes either which in many cases involve only side-chains. Thus, we can only infer possible changes in the structure around the substitution sites. In the case of Val/Leu to Ala substitutions at largely buried sites (fraction buried . 0.9), studies of several model systems that include T4 and human lysozyme, SNase, barnase, RNase Sa, show that "cavity creating" amino acid substitutions never lead to dramatic structural changes that completely eliminate cavities.8,37,51 In some cases there are no conformational changes and the structure remains completely unchanged. In the rest of the cavity creating variants, there are some movements in the position of atoms lining the newly created cavity but in each case the cavity remained in the structure of the variant.32,51 The difference in the size of the remaining cavity appears to correlate with the stability: the larger the cavity is the less stable is the protein variant.51

It should be noted that all the data listed in this Table are restricted to the substitutions at positions that are more than 90% buried. We were unable to find any data on the effects of Val or Leu to Asn and Gln to Leu, Val, Asn, Thr, Ser substitutions on the protein stability.

What is even more important, despite the differences in the absolute values, similar substitutions always produce qualitatively similar changes in stability at these fully buried sites.29 ­ 31 These experiments describing the cavity creating mutations showed that the structural perturbations do not have a significant effect on the structure of a protein around the substitution site. Therefore, it is not surprising that the isosteric substitutions such as Val to Thr also do not perturb the structure significantly.29,41 A notable example is the structure of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase), in which severe perturbations in the chemical structure of Val66 that is fully buried in the hydrophobic environment have been introduced.46,49 Substitutions with Gly, Ala or Ile produced structures superimposable with the WT structure. Furthermore, substitutions with two highly polar residues that are bulkier than Val, V66E and V66K were also shown to produce very small perturbations in the protein structure. From these and numerous other examples we infer that the changes in the structure of ubiquitin variants discussed in this work are probably very modest. The third scenario, is similar to the previous one, but with the cavities being filled with water molecules. Only rarely was this observed, partly because water molecules that are not ordered would not be seen in the X-ray experiment.52,53 In some cases even when buried water is observed, their contribution to the stability appears to be very small. Detailed structural and thermodynamic analysis of the buried water in T4 lysozyme demonstrated that these buried water molecules are energy neutral.54 Theoretical calculations also support the energetic neutrality of buried water molecules: molecular dynamics simulations of Garcia & Hummer55 indicate that entropically interior water molecules are similar to the bulk water. In other cases it appears that buried water molecules are stabilizing. For example, two out of five structures of different single site Ile to Ala substituted human lysozyme showed presence of a water molecule in the cavity created by the sub-

stitution. These two proteins were somewhat less destabilized than the other three, which appeared to have cavity empty. Nevertheless, qualitatively all five substitutions were significantly destabilizing.56 Thus, even without detailed information about the structure of the site of amino acid substitution we can discuss the effects of substitutions on stability. The conclusions reached from such analysis will be mostly qualitative, but we believe they will provide the essence of the contribution of different forces to protein stability. The purpose of the experiments described above is to obtain insights on the effects of burial of polar and non-polar amino acid side-chains on the enthalpy and Gibbs energy changes upon protein unfolding. At least three major factors, van der Waals (packing) interaction, hydrogen bonding and hydration are expected to be affected by the amino acid substitutions at buried sites. The key is to separate these different contributions at least on a qualitative level. We will start discussing relatively simple cases that involve only two types of interactions: packing and hydration. Cavity creating substitutions of Val/Leu to Ala The amino acid substitutions of larger non-polar residues with smaller ones such as V5A, V17A and L67A will have an effect on two factors: hydration of these side-chains in the unfolded state, and the packing interactions formed in the native state. It is expected that the changes in hydration for these substitutions should produce relative small changes in thermodynamic parameters (Table 3). For example, the difference in Gibbs energy of hydration of Val or Leu relative to Ala (see Table 3) is expected to be destabilizing and is estimated to be 2 2.6 kJ/mol (Val ! Ala) and 2 3.7 kJ/mol (Leu ! Ala).57 The difference in the configurational entropy upon Val or Leu substitutions for Ala, 2TDDSðVal=Leu ! AlaÞ; on the other hand should be stabilizing by 2 ­4 kJ/ mol, depending on different estimates.58 ­ 60 Thus,

these two contributions should largely offset each other and the resulting stability of the protein variant should remain unchanged. However, the experimentally observed changes in DDG upon Val/Leu to Ala substitutions are significant (213 kJ/mol, 27 kJ/mol and 2 12 kJ/mol for V5A, V17A and L67A, substitutions, respectively) and, as discussed above, comparable with the similar substitutions obtained in other proteins. One can conclude that this decrease in stability is due to the loss of packing interactions (cavity formation) in the native state of the alanine-containing variant. Furthermore, we can estimate the destabilizing effect of cavity formation per one carbon (methyl/ methylene group) atom. Val to Ala substitution removes two carbon atoms, whereas Leu to Ala eliminates three carbon atoms. V5A, V17A and L67A substitutions destabilize by 2 13 kJ/mol, 2 7 kJ/mol and 2 12 kJ/mol, respectively, resulting in a destabilization of 4­ 6 kJ/mol per carbon atom upon cavity formation. This estimate is in accordance with the results of earlier experimental studies13,30,51,61 ­ 67 and theoretical estimates.68 ­ 70 In addition to DG, we can also estimate the enthalpy of cavity formation upon Val/Leu to Ala substitutions. All three ubiquitin variants with large-to-small non-polar substitutions have much lower enthalpy of unfolding than the wild-type protein. This difference, DDH, is 2 26 kJ/mol, 2 22 kJ/mol and 2 35 kJ/mol for V5A, V17A, and L67A, respectively. The enthalpy of hydration of valine or leucine relative to alanine at this temperature (see Table 3) is expected to be small, 2 3 kJ/ mol (Val ! Ala) and 2 5 kJ/mol (Leu ! Ala).57 Thus, all of the observed differences in the enthalpies of unfolding of the variants are not due to the difference in hydration. The only other factor (other than structural changes that are unlikely for the reasons discussed above) that can be responsible for this decrease in the enthalpy of unfolding is the decrease in packing (van der Waals) interactions.57 Val to Ala and Leu to Ala substitutions lead to the elimination of two and three carbon atoms, respectively. Then the enthalpic effect due to the decrease in packing when calculated per carbon atom is very similar for all three (V5A, V17A, L67A) variants, 2 12(^ 1) kJ/mol. There is

no similar estimate for the enthalpy of disruption of packing interactions in proteins. We can, however, compare it to the enthalpy changes upon sublimation or vaporization of non-polar molecules. Vaporization and sublimation data will model packing in the protein interior as organic liquid or organic crystal and will probably bracket the minimal and maximal possible values for the enthalpy disruption of packing interactions. For example, the enthalpy of vaporization of pentane is 26.4 kJ/ mol that according to Lazaridis et al.71 translates into the interaction energy of 10.6 kJ/mol of carbon atoms and will provide an estimate for the lower limit of DDH packing per carbon atom. The upper limit will be provided by the enthalpy of sublimation of pentane (39.1 kJ/mol) that translates into the interaction (crystal packing) energy of 15.6 kJ/ mol of carbon atoms.71 Clearly the experimental data on ubiquitin is between these two extremes, indicating that probably the interior of a protein is not packed as well as organic crystal. To summarize the analysis of Val/Leu to Ala substitutions, the thermodynamic consequences are that these substitutions primarily decreased the protein stability by decreasing the strength of packing interactions in the native state. Independent of the substitution site the Gibbs energy decrease was 5 kJ/mol of carbon atoms. This destabilization appears to be mainly due to the enthalpic factor: the observed decrease in the enthalpy of unfolding is independent of the substitution site and is 2 12 kJ/mol of carbon atom. The entropic gain is most probably associated with the increased flexibility of the residues lining the newly created cavity. These results are in agreement with a number of experimental and theoretical observations, strengthening the opinion that packing interactions are an important factor for protein stabilization.15,72 ­ 90 Non-polar (Val/Leu) to polar (Thr) substitutions Numerous instances in which the structures of Val or Leu to Thr variants of different proteins have been solved, the protein structures appear to be very tolerant to substitution. For example, the backbone structure of wild-type T4 lysozyme

° (2LZM) has 0.16 A deviation from the structures of two variants with Val to Thr substitutions (V87T, 128L and V149T, 126L). The magnitude of DDG observed for T4 lysozyme mutants is certainly similar to the DDG observed in this study. We can thus assume that Val to Thr substitutions in ubiquitin had very small effects on the structure, and that the Thr side-chain is packed in the same environment as Val. If so, one can assess a possible change in interactions upon insertion of Thr instead of Val/Leu at three positions of ubiquitin. Val and Thr are both b-branched side-chains and thus have the same shape and can be considered isosteric. Despite this similarity in shape and similar atomic volumes, Val appears to have a somewhat larger van der Waals volume than Thr (Table 3). Obviously the Leu side-chain is larger than Thr (see Table 3). Thus, the average distance from the neighboring atoms will be longer for the hydroxyl group of Thr than for the methyl group of Val. Since packing interactions are strongly distancedependent this should lead to a decrease in the strength of packing interactions. However, the polarizability of hydroxyl oxygen is higher than for carbon and thus the minimum of the packing interactions (as modeled for example by 6 ­12 potential) with the hydroxyl oxygen atom is deeper than for carbon atom.91,92 This difference is not very large at the distances observed for protein groups (the nearest neighbors through space for CG1 or ° CG2 of Val5 and Val17 are at least 4 A apart). Thus, one should expect an overall similar strength in packing interactions for substitutions of buried Val with Thr because of compensation due to increase in distance (EvdW , 1/r 6) and increase in the polarizability (EvdW , a). Nevertheless, the experimental observation is that substitutions of buried non-polar Val or Leu residues to Thr are always somewhat destabilizing. More importantly, the destabilization upon Val/Leu to Thr substitutions is larger than the corresponding substitutions with Ala (Figures 4 and 5; Table 1). Keeping in mind that the Ala substitutions will have the largest effect on the packing interactions, the only possible reason for the Val/Leu to Thr substitution to be more destabilizing than Val/Leu to Ala substitutions can be the difference in hydration. Indeed, the difference in Gibbs energy of hydration of Val/Leu versus Thr is of the order of 2 30 kJ/mol (Table 3) and is independent of whether the DG values are for the transfer to aqueous solution from the gas phase57 or cyclohexane.93 Furthermore, if the difference in hydration between Val/Leu and Thr is the cause of decrease in stability of V5T, V17T and L67T variants, they should also have lower enthalpy of unfolding. As already discussed, the energy of packing interactions (van der Waals interactions) by Thr might be expected to be equal or stronger than for Val/Leu in the same environment. If the Val/Leu to Thr substitutions affected just packing interactions, the enthalpy of unfolding of Thr variants should either remain the same or be

higher than the WT. Experimentally, however, a significant decrease in enthalpy of unfolding (2 37 kJ/mol, 2 22 kJ/mol and 2 28 kJ/mol for V5A, V17T and L67T, respectively) is observed. It is known from the study of model compound transfer data that the large difference in the Gibbs energy of hydration, DGhyd, between Val/Leu and Thr is defined by a large difference in the hydration enthalpy, DDHhyd ¼ DHhyd(Val/Leu) 2 DHhyd(Thr). According to Makhatadze & Privalov,72 this difference is very large, in the order of 2 33 kJ/ mol (Table 3). This close correspondence between DDHhyd and DDHexp (2 27(^ 7) kJ/mol averaged over three variants) is probably fortuitous. Another variant, L67S further supports the notion that the decrease in stability and the enthalpy of unfolding upon substitution with Thr is largely defined by the unfavorable energy of hydration of Thr relative to Val/Leu. The serine residue has very similar enthalpy and Gibbs energy of hydration to Thr but has one carbon atom less in the side-chain. So the loss in hydration of Ser will be the same as for Thr but there will be additional loss of packing. Thus, L67S is predicted to be even less stable that L67T. This is exactly what is observed experimentally (Table 1). Furthermore, the difference in DDH between L67S and L67T is 11 kJ/mol, consistent with the loss of packing of one carbon atom as estimated above from Val/Leu to Ala substitutions (see the previous section). Non-polar (Val/Leu) to polar (Asn) substitutions The effect of Val/Leu to Thr substitutions suggest that dehydration upon burial of a polar side-chain in the native state significantly destabilizes the protein structure and that this destabilization is largely enthalpic. To further confirm the importance of hydration at the buried sites we analyzed the substitutions to Asn. The Asn sidechain has a volume similar to Thr but smaller than Val or Leu. Despite this, Asn is much more polar than Thr, as evidenced by a much more negative enthalpy and Gibbs energy of hydration (Table 3). The difference in Gibbs energy of hydration between Val/Leu and Asn is of the order of 2 52 kJ/mol. This DDG value is largely defined by the enthalpic factor, DDHhyd(Val/Leu ! Asn) < 2 58 kJ/mol. Compared to Val/Leu to Thr substitutions, the Gibbs energy and enthalpy of hydration for Val/Leu to Asn substitutions is almost twice as high. Thus, if our conclusion that hydration upon burial of polar group is highly destabilizing is correct then we should expect that V5N, V17N, and L67N substitutions would be even more destabilizing than V5T, V17T and L67T. This is exactly what is observed experimentally: Asn substitutions at three fully buried sites of ubiquitin lead to a further decrease in stability compared to Thr (Table 1). Thus, our results are in agreement with previous notion that buried "...non-charged polar groups that lack a hydrogen-bonding partner are very destabilizing."94

Moreover, a significant decrease in the enthalpy of unfolding is also observed, which is consistent with the large enthalpy of dehydration of polar groups.57,70 To summarize the analysis of Val/Leu to Thr or Asn substitutions, the thermodynamic consequences are that these substitutions decreased the protein stability. The primary cause for this significant destabilization upon the burial of polar sidechain in non-polar protein interior is the dehydration of polar surface. These effects are enthalpy driven and depend on the type of the amino acid side-chain. Burial of less polar Thr is less destabilizing than the burial of an Asn sidechain. Substitutions at buried polar residue How do these conclusions reconcile with the notion that there are many buried polar amino acid side-chains in proteins? According to McDonald & Thornton95 the majority (. 98%) of all buried polar side-chains form hydrogen bonding. Since hydrogen bonding is stabilizing it will compensate for an unfavorable energy of dehydration of burial of polar side-chain. To further support this conclusion and gain deeper insights into how unfavorable dehydration of polar groups upon burial is compensated by the formation of buried hydrogen bond, we analyzed the effects of amino acid substitutions at position 41 on the stability of ubiquitin. Glutamine at position 41 is 100% buried in the native structure. The NE2 nitrogen atom of Gln41 forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen atoms of Lys27 and Ile36. We first substituted Gln41 with non-polar residues Leu and Val, thus eliminating two hydrogen bonds. Gln has a van der Waals ° volume of 66 A3 that is somewhat larger than that ° of Val (57 A3) but smaller than the volume of Leu ° (76 A3). Despite being smaller than Leu, Gln and Leu have a very similar shape. Thus, in the case of Gln to Leu substitution there might be a small "overpacking" created by the Leu side-chain, but Val should be able to fit into the space previously occupied by Gln. This seems to indeed be the case, i.e. the Q41L ubiquitin variant is less stable than the Q41V protein (Figure 6). What is more important is that the Q41V protein is as stable as the wild-type protein. The Q41V variant is also similar to the wild-type protein in terms of enthalpy of unfolding (Table 1). We can conclude therefore that dehydration of buried Gln sidechain that forms two hydrogen bonds has the same effect on the stability as dehydration of a non-polar group with a similar volume that is buried into a non-polar environment. Since the combined effect of dehydration of non-polar groups and their packing in a non-polar environment is in essence a hydrophobic effect,57 one can conclude that hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect are of the same magnitude, in accord with earlier work.13,57

To further estimate the separate contributions of the effects of hydration upon burial of polar groups and hydrogen bonding in the protein interior we analyzed the ubiquitin variant with a Gln to Asn substitution in position 41. The Asn residue has the thermodynamics of hydration similar to that of Gln, the difference in the Gibbs energy and enthalpy of hydration is only a few kJ/mol (Table 3). However, the side-chain of Asn is one covalent ° bond (, 1.5 A) or one methylene group shorter than the side-chain of Gln. The van der Waals volume of Asn is smaller than that of Gln but similar to the volume of Val residue (Table 3). Thus, Asn at position 41 eliminates two hydrogen bonds, in addition to a small decrease in packing. This decrease in packing can be expected to be similar to that of Q41V due to the similarity in volumes of Asn and Val (Table 3). What is most important, however, is that the Q41N substitution would not change the amount of buried polar surface, thus retaining energetically and enthalpically unfavorable hydration upon burial of polar groups. The effect of Gln to Asn substitution at this 100% buried site is dramatic! The Q41N variant is 10.7 kJ/mol less stable than the WT protein. This observation supports the conclusion that in order to compensate the unfavorable energy of dehydration, the buried polar groups must form hydrogen bonding. Another interesting observation is that the 10.7 kJ/mol decrease in stability (DDG ) is also accompanied by a 36 kJ/mol decrease in the enthalpy of unfolding. This indicates that the energy of hydrogen bonding in the protein interior has a significant enthalpic component. The destabilizing effect of a burial of polar sidechain is further supported by the Q41T variant. The side-chains of Thr and Asn have similar van der Waals volume and thus should have similar packing interactions (Table 3). Yet, the dehydration of the Thr side-chain has much a lower DG value than the dehydration of the Asn side-chain. Thus, if dehydration plays a role, the Q41T substitution should be destabilizing but to a much lower degree than the Q41N substitution. Again this is what is observed experimentally (Table 1). The Q41T variant is five times less destabilized than Q41N, 2 1.8 kJ/mol versus 2 10.7 kJ/mol, respectively. The Q41S substitution provides further support for this. Ser and Thr residues have the same hydration but Ser is smaller than Thr a by methyl group. As a result, the Q41S variant is less stable than Q41T, which is consistent with the loss of packing of one methyl group.

Conclusions
Based on the analyses of Gibbs energies and enthalpies of over a dozen different amino acid substitutions at four different fully buried sites of the ubiquitin molecule we concluded the following.

1. Packing of non-polar groups in the protein interior is favorable and is largely defined by a favorable enthalpy of van der Waals interactions. For example, the removal of one methylene group from the protein interior will destabilize a protein by , 5 kJ/mol, of which 12 kJ/mol of the loss of stability will come from the decrease in the enthalpy of a protein. 2. Burial of polar groups in the non-polar interior of a protein is highly destabilizing, and the degree of destabilization depends on the relative polarity of this group. For example, burial of a Thr side-chain in the non-polar interior will be less destabilizing than burial of an Asn side-chain. The decrease in stability is defined by a large enthalpy of dehydration of polar groups. 3. The destabilizing effect of dehydration of polar groups upon burial can be neutralized or compensated if these buried polar groups form hydrogen bonding. The energy of this hydrogen bonding, which appears to have a large enthalpic component, will compensate for the unfavorable dehydration energy. As a result the effect will be energetically neutral or even slightly stabilizing.

Materials and Methods
Mutagenesis and expression of ubiquitin variant Site-directed mutagenesis of the yeast ubiquitin gene was carried out by using the QuickChangeTM Sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The presence of mutations was confirmed by sequencing the entire ubiquitin gene using an ABI 100 genetic analyzer. Overexpression of the ubiquitin variants was done in the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. Each variant was purified to apparent homogeneity as described.28 Due to a significant decrease in stability upon of some of the substitutions, the mutations were introduced in two different backgrounds: WTp, which is a yeast ubiquitin gene carrying the K63R substitution; and WT#, which carries two substitutions, K63R and R42E and has a ,13 8C higher than WTp thermostability.28,96 Differential scanning calorimetry Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a VP-DSC (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) instrument at a scan rate of 1.5 deg/ minute. The protein concentration for ubiquitin mutants varied between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/ml. Temperatureinduced unfolding of all variants was checked for reversibility by comparing first and second DSC scans, and found to be always better than 90%. Detailed procedures of the sample preparation for the DSC experiment were the same as described.28,97 The partial molar heat capacity of the protein, Cp;pr ðTÞ; was obtained from the experimentally measured apparent heat capacity difference between the sample (containing protein solution) and reference (containing corresponding buffer solution)
