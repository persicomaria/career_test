The pentameric Escherichia coli enzyme 2-hydroxypentadienoic acid hydratase assembles to form a 20-nm-diameter particle comprising 60 protein subunits, arranged with 532 symmetry when crystallised at low pH in the presence of phosphate or sulphate ions. The particles form rapidly and are stable in solution during gel filtration at low pH. They are probably formed through trimers of pentamers, which are stabilised by the interaction of two phosphate ions with residues of the N-terminal domains of subunits at the 3-fold axis. Once the particles are formed at high concentrations of phosphate (or sulphate), they remain stable in solution at 20-fold lower concentrations of the anion. Guest molecules can be trapped within the hollow protein shell during assembly. The C-termini of the subunits are freely accessible on the surface of the protein cage and thus are ideal sites for addition of affinity tags or other modifications. These particles offer a convenient model system for studying the assembly of large symmetrical structures and a novel protein nanoparticle for encapsulation and cargo delivery.

Introduction
2-Hydroxypentadienoic acid hydratase (MhpD) is the fourth enzyme in the m-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid catabolic pathway of Escherichia coli.1 It is a divalent cation-dependent hydratase that converts 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoic acid (HPD) into 4-hydroxy-2-ketopentanoic acid, which is then converted by succeeding enzymes into the Krebs cycle intermediates pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. The MhpDcatalysed reaction proceeds rapidly, with a kcat of 450 s- 1, which is thought to be necessary due to the short half-life of the substrate.2 A three-dimensional structure of MhpD has been determined previously to 2.9 Å resolution 3 by a structural genomics consortium (New York Structural Genomics Re*Corresponding author.

search Consortium) [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1SV6]. The quaternary structure of MhpD in this crystal is pentameric and made up of identical 30kDa subunits, each comprising 261 amino acids. The crystal structure of a homologous protein, 2-oxohept-3-ene-1,7-dioate hydratase (HpcG), has been reported recently and solved to a resolution of 1.6 Å (PDB code 2EB4).4 This enzyme belongs to the homoprotocatechuate degradation pathway of E. coli and also forms a homopentameric assembly. The crystal contains two pentamers stacked together on a common 5-fold axis to form a decamer. This decamer is also formed in solution, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation.4 More remote family members, such as KdhA from Sulfolobus solfataricus5 and Mus musculus fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase,6 adopt tetrameric and dimeric forms, respectively. Here we describe the formation of a large dodecahedral protein cage from the E. coli enzyme MhpD. Natural systems employ a wide range of selfassembling containers in different biological processes. For example, virus particles carry and deliver viral genomes to target cells, the protein ferritin sequesters iron for storage, and certain heat shock proteins encapsulate protein folding intermediates and chaperone their correct folding. Very large enzyme superstructures have been identified within cells, where their organisation is of special interest

They provide a library of materials ranging in size from 9 nm to 30 nm, with variable properties including symmetry, interior cage volume and chemical character, window size, and thermal stability. In addition to the inherent properties of the protein cage arising in nature, there is considerable scope through biotechnological methods to modify the particles for particular applications. For instance, polypeptide chain extensions might be added to interior or exterior surfaces, enabling targeting to particular locations or engineering affinity for other particular molecules inside and outside the cage. (For reviews of protein cages as multifunctional nanoplatforms with applications in materials science, electronics, imaging, and drug delivery, see Uchida et al.8 and Niemeyer.9) The MhpD cage described here forms under nonphysiological conditions and has potential utility in nanoscience applications, but it remains to be discovered whether related particles have a role in a biological context.

Results
Protein purification and crystallisation Typically 120 mg of protein showing an  30-kDa single-stained band on a heavily loaded SDS electrophoresis gel was recovered from a 1-l culture without any special effort to optimise production. A His6 tag provides a convenient affinity purification procedure, but overexpression is so good that other methods (salt precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography) would likely suffice. Size-exclusion chromatography­multiangle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) gave an Mr of 151, 000, indicating that MhpD is a homopentamer (data not shown), in accordance with the previously determined crystal structure.3 Following prolonged incubation of crystallisation screens (4 weeks), flat plate-like crystals grew under a number of conditions. All of these conditions contained high concentrations of phosphate ions and low pH. Subsequently, the same crystal form was grown using 1 M Na/K dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 3.2) or 0.75 M ammonium sulphate in 100 mM formate buffer (pH 3.2). The space group of the crystals was determined to be H3 (a = 207.35 Å, b = 207.35 Å, c = 545.47 Å,  = 90°,  = 90°, and  = 120°) from the translation function during molecular replacement. Crystallographic statistics are included in Table 1. The MhpD model has a good geometry, with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of  0.01 Å for bonds and an rmsd of  1.43° for angles. In the Ramachandran plot, 100% of residues are located in the allowed regions (89% are located in the most favoured regions).

Values in parentheses correspond to the highest-resolution shell. b Rfree was calculated with a subset (5%) of randomly selected reflections.

Structural analysis of crystal asymmetric unit Electron density maps showed that four pentamers were packed together edge to edge in the asymmetric unit to produce a curved surface. Replication of this arrangement by the crystal 3fold symmetry defines a dodecahedral particle of MhpD molecules comprising 12 pentamers or 60 monomers (Fig. 1). The complete unit cell contains three dodecahedra (i.e., 36 pentamers of MhpD or 180 individual protein subunits). The protein particles of the crystal lattice are organised with local face-centred cubic close packing (ABC alternation), with each dodecahedron being surrounded by 12 others. The high solvent content of the crystal ( 67%) can be accounted for by the large solvent volumes within the particles. The four pentamers in the asymmetric unit are composed of the following subunits: ABCDE (pent1), FGHIJ (pent2), KLMNO (pent3), and PQRST (pent4). Structure of an individual MhpD subunit The tertiary structure of each protein subunit can be divided into roughly three domains: the largest and central domain is made up of an incomplete barrel, comprising a strongly twisted -sheet of seven substantial strands interleaved by short helices. At the N-terminus, there is a small -helical domain; at the C-terminus, there is a small antiparallel -sheet (Fig. 2). The helices flanking the barrel are involved in interactions between subunits within and between pentameric assemblies. The

tertiary arrangement has the FAH fold, first defined for the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase,6 and is included in the FAH superfamily of the SCOP database.10 As can be seen from the topology diagram in Fig. 2a, the fold of MhpD is very similar to the archetypal FAH fold. The major difference is that mouse FAH has an  120-residue /-sandwich N-terminal domain (NTD), whereas MhpD has only an  50-residue all--helical NTD. Another smaller difference is that the excursion following strand 3 of the -barrel in MhpD consists of one strand, whereas it consists of three -strands in FAH. A -strand of this excursion in both proteins runs parallel with the last -strand of the C-terminal domain (CTD). Sequences of other family members are also of variable lengths due to terminal extensions and substantial inserts. The crystal structure of HpcG is very closely related to that of MhpD, and coordinates superpose over almost the entire length of the polypeptide chain, including the small -helical NTD, even though they have only a 32% sequence identity. It is possible to fit 936 main-chain atoms of HpcG and MhpD with an rmsd close to 1 Å, omitting small surface loops and disordered regions.4 The active site of MhpD, inferred from sequence alignment with HpcG, consists of three acidic residues (Glu105, Glu107, and Glu138), which would likely be involved in coordinating the divalent cation essential for activity. The active-site pocket is buried within the core of the FAH fold and situated within the partial -barrel structure, with

the base of the pocket being formed by -strand 1. It appears to be accessible to the substrate only from the exterior surface of the protein cage. Features of pentameric MhpD The N-terminal -helical extension from the typical FAH fold comprises residues 1­55. It is divided into three helices that pack against the body of the -barrel and against the smaller helix G (residues Phe151-Asp157), which is sandwiched between the two features. The buried surface area of each subunit in the pentameric structure is  1566 Å2 (about 13.5% of the subunit surface area). The interface predominantly involves the helix F (residues Thr122-Ala129) of one subunit sitting in a pocket of the neighbouring subunit formed by the opening of the -barrel, which is situated on the inner surface of the particle. Helix F thus blocks the active site from the inner cavity of the MhpD protein cage. In this interface, Glu125 of helix F forms a salt bridge with Arg55 of the neighbouring subunit. The remainder of the interface consists of two smaller regions. The first is an interaction between the loop formed by residues Pro173-Asn180 (of the helix F subunit) and the loop formed by residues Pro169-Gln171 of the neighbouring subunit. The interaction here occurs predominantly through van der Waals contact of the two loops, coupled with an H-bonding interaction between a backbone amide and a carbonyl group

(Ala170 O to Gly175 N, 2.9 Å). The second small contact region is located between Gly202-Asn206 (of helix F subunit) and Asp90-Glu92 of the neighbouring subunit. In this instance, a number of H-bonds are formed: Asp90 O to Asn206 ND2 (2.9 Å), Asn91 OD1 to Gly202 O (3.2 Å), and Glu92 OE2 to Asn206 OD1 (3.4 Å). Nanoparticle formation The electron density indicated two bound ligands at the junction of groups of three pentamers (the 3fold axis) whose coordination geometry was consistent with that of bound phosphate ions derived from the crystal mother liquor. One phosphate ion is coordinated by three arginine residues (Arg15) arising from three N-terminal helices. The other phosphate ion is coordinated by three glutamine

residues (Gln19) from the same helices (Fig. 3). A sulphate ion occupies the Arg15 phosphate position when crystals are grown from ammonium sulphate. When viewed down the 3-fold axis, these anions lie one above the other along the axis, but are approximately 5 Å apart. The phosphate coordinated to the Arg15 residues lies towards the interior of the cage, whereas the phosphate coordinated by the Gln19 residues lies towards the exterior of the cage. Interactions between the three N-terminal helices of each subunit in this region provide a considerable proportion of the stabilizing interface of the protein particle. Each subunit at this interface has a buried surface area of 967 Å2, which is  8.3% of the total surface area of the subunit. The total surface area buried between the three pentamers around this axis (involving nine subunits in an isolated trimer) is  7196 Å2, which is  5% of the total surface area of

the three pentamers of MhpD (Fig. 4). The total buried surface area of any particular subunit within the particle is 2815 Å2, arising from a combination of interactions between adjacent monomers in the pentamer and interactions at the 3-fold axis. This is

approximately 24% of the total surface area of each subunit. The residues of the N-terminal helices that are principally involved in the interactions between pentamers are Lys3, His4, Asp12, Arg15, Glu18, and

1384 Gln19, which would all be solvent exposed in the pentameric form of MhpD. The side-chain amine of Lys3 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Gln52 (NZ-O, 2.9 Å) of the adjacent subunit. His4 stacks against the guanidinium group of Arg54 of the adjacent subunit, which is also stacked against Phe83 of its own subunit on the other face of the side chain. The charge on Arg54 would be neutralised by the salt bridge that it forms with Asp85 of its own subunit (OD1-NE,  2.8 Å; OD2-NH2,  2.8 Å). Arg54 also forms an H-bond with Asp49 of the same subunit (OD2-NH1,  2.9 Å). The Asp12 carboxylate forms H-bonds with the backbone carbonyl of Glu18 (OD1-O, 3.1­3.5 Å; OD2-O, 2.8­3.1 Å) of the adjacent subunit and with the side chain of Arg15 (OD1-NH2  2.6 Å) of the same subunit. The side chain of Arg15 forms Hbonding interactions with the side chains of Glu18 (NH1-OE1,  3.2 Å; NH2-OE1, 3.4 Å) and Gln19 (NE-OE1, 3.0­3.4 Å) of the adjacent subunit, as well as the all-important binding of one phosphate ion (see the text below). Gln19 also binds the other phosphate ion at the 3-fold axis. These fairly extensive interactions occur between two adjacent subunits at the 3-fold axis; thus, corresponding interactions are replicated two more times to complete the trimeric arrangement. The tetrahedral phosphate ion coordinated by the three Arg15 residues is arranged with the apical oxygen pointed along the 3-fold axis, towards the exterior of the particle. This oxygen is almost equally bound by all three Arg residues (O-NH1, 2.9 Å). The other three oxygens of the phosphate are positioned such that each one is pointed towards one of the adjacent Arg residues (O-NH1, 2.5­3.0 Å). The other phosphate at the 3-fold is also arranged such that the apical oxygen is pointed along the axis, but towards the interior of the cage. The three remaining oxygen atoms are pointed toward each adjacent Gln19. The apical oxygen is 3.1­3.5 Å from the Gln19 NE2, and the other oxygens are  2.7 Å away from the Gln19 NE2. The OE1 atoms of the Gln19 side chains are also only 3 Å away from the phosphate oxygens. Two types of interaction participate in sparse contacts between particles in the crystal lattice. These involve only one or two subunits per pentamer for each particle. One involves -strands 8 and 9, where the side chains of Glu190 and Glu191 from -strand 9 and the side chain of Arg187 from -strand 8 are principally involved. In the other interaction type, -strands 8 and 9 and -strand 11 are the principal points involving interactions between Lys184 and Glu191 of one subunit and Glu250 of an adjacent one. His248 of each subunit also makes contacts. Additional phosphate ions are also found at these interfaces. Features of dodecahedral MhpD Each approximately spherical protein particle has an external diameter of 20 nm and encloses an internal cavity of 15 nm diameter. At the centre of each pentameric face, there is a 1.5-nm-diameter

window passing completely through the protein layer, lined with 10 basic residues, with Arg114 and Arg172 from each subunit (Fig. 5). A further, but less pronounced, penetration of the protein layer occurs at the 2-fold axes of the particle. The opening can be conveniently considered to be rectangular with dimensions of 4 nm × 1 nm; but in fact, the long edges are highly corrugated, with substantial narrowing towards the axis. The long edges are each defined by the termini of three long helices and three short helices, while the short edges derive from corner loops of the -barrel. The constriction close to the axis brings together two Asp33 residues and two Asp75 residues from subunits of different pentamers into close contact. The closest interaction would occur between Asp33 OD2 of one subunit and Asp33 OD2 of another subunit, with a distance of 3.8 Å. The distances between Asp75 and Asp33 are in the region of 6 Å (Fig. 6). This arrangement is only expected to be stable below the pKa of aspartic acid. At neutral pH, side-chain repulsion would not be expected to favour the formation of the dodecahedral particle, unless appropriate counterions were bound. The C-terminal regions of each subunit, including the His6 tag, project from the outer surface of the particle, and the absence of electron density from Ser261 onward suggests that they are highly mobile. The protein N-termini are located towards the inner face of the particle and are significantly involved in the interface at the 3-fold axis. The curvature of the protein shell in this region leads to crowding and little scope for tags of appreciable size. Indeed, we find that the N-terminal solubility tag interferes with particle formation at pH 3.2 (data not shown). Formation of MhpD cages in solution and entrapment Gel filtration of MhpD on Superdex 200 (10/30) in 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 3.2) produces a symmetrical absorbance peak at 8.5 ml, a little after the column void volume, suggesting that a large protein particle much like that observed in the crystal is also formed in solution. Dispersal of the concentrated MhpD stock in the low-pH buffer and loading took as little as 2 min, followed by the 16-min elution time. This suggests that the particles form rapidly and maintain their stability during the dilution ( 10-fold) experienced during gel filtration. SECMALLS estimates a molecular mass of 1.64 MDa, close to that expected from the crystallographic results (12 pentamers of MhpD would be  1.8 MDa). The protein cages must first be formed with at least 1 M phosphate (pH 3.2), but can then maintain their stability at lower phosphate concentrations at pH 3.2. Once particles are formed, the phosphate concentration of the column eluent can be reduced to 50 mM (pH 3.2) and still give only one symmetrical peak at 8.5 ml, indicating complete retention of the caged form. Under these conditions, it is necessary to include 100 mM NaCl in the elution buffer to overcome protein interactions with the

column matrix. The particles remain intact following incubation for several days in 50 mM phosphate/ 100 mM NaCl (pH 3.2). The solubility of the protein particles is limited to  2 mg/ml under these conditions. Addition of  10% glycerol to the buffers allows the formation of the particles at higher concentrations of MhpD, possibly by reducing the self-association of particles. Gel filtration of MhpD particles produced in the presence of cytochrome c showed Soret band absorbance from liganded haem at 406 nm eluting at the same volume as the protein particle, suggesting entrapment during particle formation. From the measured absorbances and associated extinction coefficients at 280 nm and 406 nm, we estimated that 2.6 molecules of cytochrome c were associated with each particle when assembly took place in the presence of 1.2 mM cytochrome c. Cytochrome c was shown to be very soluble in the high-phosphate lowpH buffer, and so aggregation onto the outer surface of the MhpD cage during gel filtration is not likely to be the explanation for the coeluting peaks. Indeed, when a very concentrated cytochrome c solution (4 mM) was added to preformed MhpD particles prior to gel filtration, no significant Soret band absorbance was observed at the MhpD elution volume. Cytochrome c gel filters under these conditions as a single low-molecular-weight species with no sign of excluded volume material. Cytochrome c is a very basic protein; at pH 3.2, MhpD also carries a net positive charge, suggesting a

strong repulsion even in the presence of phosphate counterion screening and little chance of nonspecific binding of sufficient affinity to withstand gel filtration. These results are consistent with encapsulation of cytochrome c during particle assembly.

Discussion
It is not uncommon for crystal packing to generate complex interacting assemblies of protein molecules that only exist within the crystal. The MhpD particles defined here in crystals are particularly interesting because similar-sized particles assemble in solution under conditions closely related to those employed in crystallisation. The assembly takes place under extreme conditions, in terms of pH (pH 3.2) and ionic environment (1 M phosphate), that are not approached in vivo. We have been unable to produce particles in solution at appreciably lower phosphate concentrations or at higher pH. For instance, no particle formation is observed at pH 4 in 0.75 M phosphate, suggesting that some critical threshold values with respect to the concentrations of protein, phosphate, and hydrogen ions must be met to enable assembly. We have not observed mixtures of assembly intermediates; under appropriate conditions, assembly is rapid. These observations are consistent with a model in which the unfavourable formation of trimers of pentamers is driven by a high phosphate ion concentration.

These trimers then rapidly associate to full particles. The strict pH dependence very likely depends, in part, on the protonation of carboxylates that come together at the 2-fold axes of the particle. It may also depend on a wider context of protein and phosphate ionisation states, since trimers unaffected by the 2fold interaction have not been observed in failed assembly reactions at higher pH. The stability of preformed particles at phosphate and protein concentrations much lower than those required to produce them is also in accordance with this model. It remains to be discovered whether the particles described here are the result of fortuitous chemistry or are related to a real biological context. Various threads of circumstantial evidence point to the latter. Johnson and Speir have reviewed the geometric problems of the self-assembly of virus capsids with reference to the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus.11 This icosahedral virus favours assembly as hexagonal sheets that maximise protein­protein interac-

tions, gaining curvature from 5-fold interactions. The rapid assembly of the dodecameric MhpD particle is likely favoured by the 5-fold symmetrical building unit, forming a T = 1 icosahedron. Metal coordination by acidic residues at particle symmetry axes or their protonation at reduced pH is an important step in cowpea chlorotic mottle virus assembly in vitro,11 and it is certainly possible that some as yet unidentified counterion could participate in stabilising MhpD particles by binding acidic residues at the 2-fold axis, providing strong parallels with capsid assembly. The conservation of these acidic residues in MhpD homologues that possess the critical NTD and phosphate-coordinating residues also suggests that a counterion like Ca2+ might be important for assembly (Table 2). The dimerisation of the Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein (CA) has also been shown to be driven by the protonation of aspartic acid side chains.14 The protein monomers were shown to dimerise in vitro

Analysis of these hits indicated that there are 29 proteins with 98­99% sequence identity to E. coli strain K12 MhpD: 28 from other strains of E. coli and 1 from Shigella sonnei. Thus, all three domains of the tripartite structure are conserved, including two that are not directly involved in the catalytic activity of the enzyme but are instead involved in either formation of the particle or interaction between particles. It is a reasonable speculation that this arrangement evolved to enable processes such as encapsulation of the reactive substrate of the enzyme, much as other compartments are known to exist in bacterial cells for sequestering reactive intermediates (for instance within the carboxysome).7,17 However, the active sites of MhpD particles described here are located within the central -barrel and are only accessible from the outer surface of the cage. Of these 29 sequences, 27 are annotated as HPD hydratases and 2 are annotated as 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase (4-OD). The 4-OD enzymes are from E. coli strain ATC8739 and E. coli BL21(DE3). Thus, we assume that these enzymes could also function as HPD hydratases or that they have been annotated incorrectly. Most non-E. coli homologues of MhpD that have significant sequence identity (25­91%) are, however, quite dissimilar in the N-terminal regions and thus would not be expected to form protein cages. A BLAST search using the NTD sequence of MhpD (residues 1­53), using the default penalties, only returned 131 closely related sequences. Of these, the first 29 are homologues with 98­99% identity to the full-length protein. The remaining hits have sequence identities down to 30%. Of these, only four have the phosphate-binding Arg and Gln residues at positions similar to those in MhpD. These include 4-OD from Pseudomonas putida W619, HPD hydratase MhpD1 from P. putida, and MhpD from Azoarcus sp. strain BH72, which have 68%, 66%, and 50% overall sequence identities to MhpD, respectively. We expect that the Arg15 and Gln19 residues of MhpD (RQ) could be conservatively replaced and still coordinate the phosphate ions to facilitate particle formation. For instance, Arg15 could be replaced by a Lys residue, and Gln19 could be replaced by an Arg or Lys residue, or indeed any residue with a suitable hydrogen-bonding side chain. Two further proteins of interest from the NTD BLAST search in this respect are MhpD2 from P. putida and 4-OD from Sphingomonas wittichi, which have KK and RR in place of the archetypal RQ, respectively. It seems that a high sequence identity within this enzyme family is not a prerequisite for the formation of pentamers. Furthermore, pentamer formation is a necessary--but not sufficient--criterion for particle formation. As noted earlier, the hydratase HpcG that has only a 32% sequence identity to E. coli K12 MhpD has a pentameric structure that is very similar to that of MhpD, but it forms a decameric quaternary structure in solution through stacking of these pentamers. The RQ sequence is not

conserved; in our hands, this protein does not form dodecahedra under conditions similar to those used with MhpD (data not shown). Formation of the MhpD particle leads to a considerable area of protein surface becoming buried. It is also noteworthy that a large number of potential ion­pair interactions exist in the structure; however, at the low pH of particle formation, these are probably present as neutral hydrogen bonds. Considerable additional stabilization of the particle is likely to arise when the carboxylate component of these interactions carries a charge at neutral pH. Guided by the disposition of the bound phosphate anions on the 3-fold axis of the MhpD particle, we speculated that a triphosphate moiety as found in ATP could be bound and could provide phosphate spacing consistent with the observed structure. Preliminary experiments confirm that ATP does indeed contribute to the formation of large MhpD aggregates at neutral pH, but further work is required to define the nature of these aggregates. Mutagenesis investigations are in progress to further understand the importance of residues implicated by the structure for particle assembly. These site-directed mutants may enable the MhpD nanoparticle to be engineered to favour assembly with phosphate or other ions at neutral pH. For example, replacement of Arg15 with His might allow cation stabilisation. The opposing carboxylates at the 2-fold axis might be mutated to improve particle stability. Mutation of Arg187, Glu190, or His248 at the particle interface might block crystallisation and improve particle solubility. The MhpD particle is novel in that it rapidly assembles at low pH in the presence of phosphate and sulphate ions. The assembly process is not impeded by the presence of high concentrations of cytochrome c. Indeed, cytochrome c is trapped within the particle. The internal volume of the nanoparticle is 2.4 × 103 nm3, which is equivalent to 2.4 × 10- 12 nl; enclosing this volume of a 1 mM solution of cytochrome c would entrap 2 molecules. Further experiments investigating other modes of guest loading are in progress to exploit potential applications of this system as a nanocontainer that can be targeted by tags on the outer surface.

Methods
Construction of expression vector The mhpD gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction from E. coli K12 chromosomal DNA using the following primers: GGAATTCGATGACGAAGCATACTCTTGAGC (forward; 5­3) and GCCCCAAAAGGAAGTCTGTCACTCGAGCGG (reverse; 5­3). Restriction sites for EcoR1 and XhoI (underlined) were included in the forward and reverse primers, respectively. This enabled the gene to be ligated into a modified pET22b (Novagen) expression vector encoding a His6 tag preceded by a dipeptide (LE) on the C-terminus of the protein and a

Assembly of a 20-nm Protein Cage by E. coli MhpD 56-residue GB-1 solubility tag at the N-terminus. The GB-1 tag is linked via a 3C protease (Precision) site that, upon cleavage, leaves three extra amino acids (GPL) at the protein N-terminus. Protein expression and purification Protein was expressed from the construct described above in BL21(DE3) cells at 37 °C for 3 h, following induction with 0.5 mM IPTG after the cell density had reached an OD600 of 0.7. The cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A [50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8), 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole]. Cell lysis was carried out by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Crude lysate was loaded onto a 10-ml Ni Sepharose affinity column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer A, at 3 ml/min. The GB-1 tag was removed by 3C protease cleavage (1:100 enzyme/fusion protein) during buffer recirculation (0.2 ml/min) on the column at 4 °C overnight. Bound MhpD was then eluted with an imidazole gradient of 10­400 mM. The eluted enzyme was further purified by Superdex 75 gel-filtration chromatography. The gel-filtration column was preequilibrated with buffer B [50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8) and 100 mM NaCl]. Eluted MhpD was concentrated to 4.5 mg/ml in 30-kDa cutoff Centricon centrifugal ultrafilters. The expression levels and the progress of the purification were followed by reducing SDS electrophoresis, where the fusion protein showed a Coomassiebrilliant-blue-stained band at an Mr of 35,000 and a purified product at an Mr of 30,000. Crystallisation and data collection The initial screening for the crystallisation conditions of MhpD, with and without Mg2+, was conducted using Molecular Dimensions Screens I and II at 4 °C using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Drops consisted of 2 l of a protein (4.5 mg/ml) solution mixed in equal proportions with a well solution. Optimal crystals were grown with either 1 M Na/K phosphate (pH 3.2) or 0.75 M ammonium sulphate in 100 mM formate buffer (pH 3.2). Crystals were cryoprotected with glycerol or paraffin oil and flash frozen in nitrogen stream at 100 K. Diffraction data for phosphate-grown crystals were collected to 2.8 Å resolution at beamline ID23-1 (wavelength of 0.9762 Å at 100 K) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), and diffraction data for sulphategrown crystals were collected to 2.9 Å resolution at beamline I04 (wavelength of 0.9722 Å at 100 K) of the Diamond Light Source (Didcot, UK). Data processing, model building, and refinement Data were indexed and intensities were integrated using MOSFLM,18 and then scaled using SCALA from the CCP4 suite.19 Phases were determined by molecular replacement with MOLREP20 using the pentameric MhpD structure (PDB code 1SV6) as search model. The resulting model was refined with REFMAC521 and manipulated using COOT.22 Rigid-body refinement was carried out, with each protomer treated as a separate rigid body. Positional and B-factor refinements were carried out using strict NCS restraints due to limited resolution. The location of phosphate ions within the electron density maps was based on the observation that the B-factor would refine to an unrealistically low value when waters

were modelled into these positions. The choice of replacing these waters with phosphate was based on a number of factors: firstly, the coordination of phosphate at these sites would give a good symmetrical H-bonding between protein side chains and the phosphate ion; secondly, the crystallisation conditions contained very high concentrations of phosphate ion; thirdly, it was known experimentally that MhpD nanoparticles only formed with high phosphate concentrations and thus must be structurally crucial; and, finally, the crystallisation conditions contained high concentrations of sodium and potassium ions, which would probably not coordinate favourably to such ligands as Arg, Asn, or Lys. This final point is also the justification we have used for incorporating either of these metal ions into the peaks of electron density adjacent to several Asp and Glu residues close to the 3-fold axes. These also did not appear to be water molecules owing to very low B-factors (b 10) and a residual positive difference density when waters were refined in these positions. The remaining strong electron density peaks are refined as water molecules only if they are within H-bonding distance of protein residues, have good densities in both 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps, and have B-factors that are within the same range as neighbouring protein residues. Water molecules have also been positioned at significant peaks of electron density near the 5fold axes of the model--one water molecule adjacent to each side chain of an Arg172, which lines the pore at this position. The final model incorporates residues 1­261 of MhpD for all 20 subunits within the asymmetric unit. Residue 0 is a Leu that is part of the protease cleavage site that precedes the N-terminal Met. As also seen for the model of MhpD already in the PDB, we can only observe good electron density for the model up to Ser261; the remaining eight residues of MhpD and the C-terminal tag are not visible in the electron density maps. There is one cis-peptide per subunit between Gly168 and Pro169. Strict NCS restraints were maintained between all 20 subunits within the asymmetric unit, except in a number of special cases. These were for residues 183­193 of subunits C, F, G, K, L, and Q, and for residues 244­250 of subunits F, G, K, and L that are involved in interactions between neighbouring MhpD nanoparticles in the crystal. These residues have different local environments in these regions compared to the other subunits, as shown by differences in the electron density maps. Therefore, NCS restraints were not applied to these residues, so that they would not be forced to occupy positions where they obviously clashed with side chains of interacting neighbours. NCS restraints were also not applied to any of the nonprotein atoms. Calculations of accessible surface areas were carried out using the areaimol programme of the CCP4 suite.19 All pictures of the MhpD model were generated using PyMOL.23 Size-exclusion chromatography­multiangle laser light scattering Molecular mass and molecular mass distributions were determined using on-line SEC-MALLS. Samples were applied in a volume of 100 l to a Superose 6 10/30 GL column equilibrated in 1.0 M Na/K phosphate (pH 3.2) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was mounted on a Jasco HPLC controlled by the Chrompass software package. The scattered light intensity of the column eluate was recorded at 16 angles using a DAWN-HELEOS laser photometer (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA). The protein concentration of the eluent was determined from the refractive index change (dn/dc = 0.186) using an

1390
OPTILAB rEX differential refractometer equipped with a Peltier temperature-regulated flow cell, maintained at 25 °C (Wyatt Technology Corp.). The wavelength of the laser in the DAWN-HELEOS laser photometer and in the light source in the OPTILAB rEX was 658 nm. The weightaveraged molecular mass of the material contained in chromatographic peaks was determined using ASTRA software version 5.1 (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Briefly, at 1-s intervals throughout the elution of peaks, the scattered light intensities, together with the corresponding protein concentrations, were used to construct Debye plots [KC/R against sin2(/2)]. The weight-averaged molecular mass was then calculated at each point in the chromatogram from the intercept of an individual plot. An overall average molecular mass and polydispersity term for each species was calculated by combining and averaging the data from the individual measurements. Protein entrapment Concentrated MhpD (22 mg/ml) was diluted 10-fold into 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 3.2) containing 14 mg/ml horse cytochrome c. The resulting mixture ( 200 l) was gel filtered through a Superdex 200 10/30 column, and the eluate was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm and 406 nm. A further experiment was carried out, but cytochrome c was added after nanoparticle formation in 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 3.2). Gel filtration of MhpD alone, under the same conditions, produced a very small light-scattering peak at 406 nm. Chromatography of cytochrome c, also under the same conditions, showed no evidence of aggregation or the presence of free haem. The relative amounts of MhpD and cytochrome c associated with eluted peaks were estimated from calculated and published extinction coefficients, respectively.24 Accession number The refined MhpD model and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB with accession code 2WQT.
