Structural Framework for the Mechanism of Archaeal Exosomes in RNA Processing
¨ Katharina Buttner, Katja Wenig, and Karl-Peter Hopfner* Gene Center and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry University of Munich Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 25 81377 Munich Germany core that associates with a variety of cofactors in a cell-compartment and species-dependent manner. For instance, the yeast core exosome contains six RNase PH-like subunits (Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp43, Rrp45, Rrp46, and Mtr3) and three KH and/or S1 domain-containing RNA binding proteins (Csl4, Rrp4, and Rrp40) (Mitchell and Tollervey, 2000). Protein-protein interaction studies and electron microscopy suggested that the six RNase PH-like subunits form a hexameric ring, which associates with the three KH- and/or S1-containing subunits (Aloy et al., 2002; Estevez et al., 2003; Raijmakers et al., 2002a). Archaeal exosomes contain only two RNase-PH subunits, denoted Rrp41 and Rrp42, and recent structural evidence suggests that alternating Rrp41 and Rrp42 subunits also assemble into a hexameric ring (Lorentzen et al., 2005). Because archaeal exosomes also contain homologs of Csl4 and Rrp4 and/or Rrp40, the core architecture of exosomes is probably conserved in evolution. The structural mechanism of exosomes in the diverse RNA processing and degradation pathways is still poorly understood. For instance, it is unclear how and why exosomes degrade some RNA substrates in a processive manner but only trim some ribosomal RNA substrates. In addition, whereas the hexameric RNase-PH domain ring of archaeal Rrp41 and Rrp42 can processively degrade small unstructured oligo(rA) substrates, complete yeast core exosomes stall at RNA with secondary structures and show only distributive activity in vitro (Mitchell et al., 1997). In vivo, processive degradation or trimming of RNA substrates by exosomes requires accessory cofactors. For instance, mRNA degradation by the cytoplasmatic exosome in yeast is activated by the superkiller (SKI) complex (Araki et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2000; van Hoof et al., 2000). Likewise, degradation of rRNA and snoRNA by the nuclear exosome requires 30 polyadenylation (LaCava et al., 2005; Wyers et al., 2005), which can also stimulate exosome processing of structured RNA in vitro. A mechanistic basis for the diverse functional features and cofactor-dependent stimulation of the exosome has not been revealed. To provide a framework for the architecture and mechanism of the core exosome, we report crystal structures and mutational analysis of two different isoforms of the archaeal exosome. Both exosome complexes consist of a hexameric ring of three Rrp41:Rrp42 heterodimers, forming the 30 /50 processing chamber, plus a trimer of either Csl4 or Rrp4 subunits, which form a regulatory substrate recognition platform at one side of the hexameric ring. Significantly, the S1 domains of Csl4 and Rrp4 frame a central pore in the substraterecognition platform that is ideally positioned to regulate and restrict entry into the central phosphorolytic processing chamber to unstructured RNA substrates. Tungstate soaking experiments and structure-guided mutagenesis in conjunction with RNase and RNA binding assays define nuclease active sites and suggest that RNA enters the exosome via this S1 pore. The functional architecture suggests a mechanism for regulated processive degradation of unstructured RNA that can

Summary Exosomes emerge as central 30 /50 RNA processing and degradation machineries in eukaryotes and archaea. We determined crystal structures of two 230 kDa nine subunit archaeal exosome isoforms. Both exosome isoforms contain a hexameric ring of RNase phosphorolytic (PH) domain subunits with a central chamber. Tungstate soaks identified three phosphorolytic active sites in this processing chamber. A trimer of Csl4 or Rrp4 subunits forms a multidomain macromolecular interaction surface on the RNase-PH domain ring with central S1 domains and peripheral KH and zinc-ribbon domains. Structural and mutational analyses suggest that the S1 domains and a subsequent neck in the RNase-PH domain ring form an RNA entry pore to the processing chamber that only allows access of unstructured RNA. This structural framework can mechanistically unify observed features of exosomes, including processive degradation of unstructured RNA, the requirement for regulatory factors to degrade structured RNA, and leftover tails in rRNA trimming. Introduction The exosome was first identified as a large multisubunit RNase complex that is required for the 30 /50 processing of ribosomal RNA in yeast (Mitchell et al., 1997). Subsequent work identified similar exosomes in humans, other eukaryotes (Allmang et al., 1999; Andrulis et al., 2002; Chekanova et al., 2002; Estevez et al., 2001), and archaea (Evguenieva-Hackenberg et al., 2003; Koonin et al., 2001). Functional analysis revealed that exosomes are involved in many other RNA processing or degradation pathways, including normal turnover of cytosolic mRNA, quality control of (pre-) mRNA (Hilleren et al., 2001), and processing of small noncoding RNA (Butler, 2002; Raijmakers et al., 2004; Vasudevan and Peltz, 2003). Recent results showed that the exosome also degrades cryptic nuclear PolII transcripts and RNA fragments arising at RNA interference processes (Orban and Izaurralde, 2005; Wyers et al., 2005). Thus, exosomes emerge as key enzymes in 30 /50 degradation processes in both eukaryotes and archaea. All exosomes identified so far are large assemblies of proven or predicted RNase and RNA binding subunits. In general, they contain a conserved RNA degradation

explain many functional features of exosomes. Our results also reveal surprisingly parallel concepts of RNA degradation by exosomes and protein degradation by proteasomes. Results and Discussion Coexpression and Purification of Different Exosome Core Complexes The 250 kDa archaeal exosome contains two RNase PHlike subunits (Rrp42 and Rrp41) along with Rrp4- and Csl4-like subunits (Evguenieva-Hackenberg et al., 2003; Koonin et al., 2001). Rrp41, Rrp42, and Rrp4 genes are located in one common operon, indicating that they are coexpressed. The Csl4 subunit is not located in this operon, and expression might be differentially regulated. For crystallization and further analysis, we coexpressed Archaeoglobus fulgidus (afu) Rrp41, Rrp42, and Rrp4 in E. coli. The resulting complex (denoted Rrp4-exosome) has a 1:1:1 subunit stoichiometry (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Coexpression of all four Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp4, and Csl4 subunits in E. coli resulted in a heterogeneous mixture of complexes that contain Rrp41 and Rrp42 in almost stoichiometric amounts and Csl4 and Rrp4 in substoichiometric amounts (Figure S1). Depending on the affinity purification strategy, we obtain an apparent 2:1 or 1:2 Rrp4:Csl4 stoichiometry. We could crystallize the major species, the ``Csl4-exosome'' isoform, with 1:1:1 (Rrp41:Rrp42:Csl4) stoichiometry. Coexpression of Rrp41, Rrp42, and Csl4 indeed resulted in a homogeneous exosome isoform with 1:1:1 stoichiometry (see Figure S1). Given the proposed defined eukaryotic exosome complexes, the ability of archaeal exosomes to form different isoforms in vitro was surprising. However, substantial stoichiometry fluctuations of Csl4 and Rrp4 subunits are also observed in the analysis of exosomes from archaeal cells (Evguenieva-Hackenberg et al., 2003; Farhoud et al., 2005). Although we do not want to rule out that additional factors help to assemble more defined archaeal exosome complexes, isoforms with different Rrp4 and/or Csl4 stoichiometry could have different activities in vivo. In any case, both Csl4- and Rrp4exosome isoforms possess processive 30 /50 degradation activity on oligo(rA) 30-mer RNA in vitro (see below). Architecture of the Archaeal Exosome To reveal the architecture of the archaeal exosome, we crystallized the Rrp4- and Csl4-exosome complexes in space group P21 and P4322, respectively. Each crystal form contained one complete exosome complex per ° asymmetric unit and diffracted X-rays to 2.7 A resolution. We obtained phase information for both crystal forms by single anomalous dispersion (SAD) experiments on selenomethionine containing protein crystals. The resulting electron-density maps were of sufficient quality to build all nine polypeptide chains in each of the two exosome complexes (see Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Data). Crystallographic data and statistics for the refined atomic models are summarized in Table 1. Both the Rrp4- and Csl4-exosome complexes form large globular molecular assemblies that consist of

nine subunits with overall dimensions of 90 3 95 3 95 ° A (Figure 1). Each complex contains three copies of the RNase PH-type subunits Rrp41 and Rrp42 plus three copies of either Rrp4 (Rrp4-exosome) or Cls4 (Csl4-exosome). Alternating Rrp41 and Rrp42 subunits assemble into a hexameric ring, which is best viewed as a trimer of three tightly engaged Rrp41:Rrp42 pairs, and contains the central phosphorolytic chamber (Lorentzen et al., 2005). Rrp4 or Csl4 forms flat, trimeric multidomain caps that cover the top face of the (Rrp41:Rrp42)3 ring (Figure 1). Both Rrp4 and Csl4 subunits possess three domains. Rrp4 contains an N-terminal six-stranded all-b domain followed by a central ribosomal protein S1 homology (S1) domain and a C-terminal protein K homology (KH) domain. The N-terminal and KH domains are situated on the outside of the Rrp4 trimer. The S1 domains are lo° cated in the center and form an w15 A wide pore (denoted ``S1 pore''). Csl4 possesses a similar N-terminal all-b domain as well as a central S1 domain. Both domains not only share the fold but also the overall position with their equivalent Rrp4 counterparts. As a result, the ° Csl4 cap also has a central, w18 A wide S1 pore. In contrast to Rrp4, Csl4 does not contain a KH domain. Instead, it possesses a small C-terminal zinc-ribbon domain, where four cysteine residues coordinate a central zinc ion. This zinc ribbon occupies the space between S1 and N-terminal domains and shares neither fold nor position with the Rrp4 KH domain. Both exosomes contain a central channel of varying width, which has openings at the S1 pore and at the opposite side of the RNase-PH domain ring (denoted ``PH pore''). Directly beneath the S1 pore, an Rrp41 loop ° forms a neck of w10 A in diameter, after which the channel widens to form a central chamber in the (Rrp41:Rrp42)3 ring. This chamber contains the phosphorolytic active sites and is additionally connected to ° the solvent by the second opening, the w18 A wide PH pore. RNase PH Ring and Phosphorolytic Active Sites The processing chamber, which possesses the phosphorolytic activity of the exosome, is assembled by six RNase-PH domains of the (Rrp41-Rrp42)3 ring. RNasePH family RNases degrade RNA by adding inorganic phosphate across the 50 -30 phosphodiester bond between the ultimate and penultimate nucleotides (Symmons et al., 2002). The reaction releases a nucleotide diphosphate from the 30 end of the RNA substrate. In the presence of ADP and low amounts of phosphate, RNase-PH family enzymes catalyze the reverse reaction and polyadenylate the 30 end. To identify phosphorolytic active sites in the nine-subunit archaeal exosome, we incubated the crystals of the Rrp4 exosome in a solution containing 50 mM tungstate and recorded anomalous dispersion data at the tungsten LIII absorption edge. Tungstate mimics phosphate and can be used to locate phosphorolytic sites of RNase-PH-type enzymes (Symmons et al., 2000). We observe strong anomalous difference electron density in the three Rrp41 pockets in the central chamber. We do not find anomalous density in equivalent positions of the Rrp42 subunits. Consistent with mutagenesis results from us (see below) and others (Lorentzen et al., 2005), these data indicate that the

archaeal exosome contains three phosphorolytic active sites. The phosphorolytic active sites are situated in an Rrp41 pocket at the interface between Rrp41 and Rrp42. N termini from two Rrp41 helices form two suitable phosphate binding moieties and contain strong tungstate anomalous difference density (>4s, Figure 2A). The highest tungstate occupancy (>8s) is found near the end of the pocket, and a modeled tungstate and/or phosphate is coordinated by G135rrp41, S136rrp41, and R97rrp41. Adjacent acidic residues (D180rrp41 and D186rrp41) are suitably positioned to participate in phosphorolytic attack. To confirm the functional relevance of these sites, we analyzed the degradation of an oligo(rA) 30-mer by the Rrp4-exosome and a corresponding D180rrp41A mutation. Consistent with the tungstate binding sites, RNase activity by the Rrp4 exosome requires the presence of phosphate and is completely abolished by the D180rrp41A mutation (Figure 2C). A second, less occupied tungstate density is observed in one active site and forms an elongated stretch between the pocket and the central channel. Three arginines (R91rrp41, R96rrp41, and R107rrp42) form a positively charged rim beneath this density (Figure 2B) and are suitably positioned to bind the backbone of RNA. Thus, this second density could mark a path for RNA that enters the phosphorolytic active sites. Taken together, the RNase-PH domain ring of the exosome

forms a self-compartmentalized cage for three phosphorolytic active sites. This architectural principle suggests that exosomes may be regulated by restricting or promoting active site access of RNA via entry or exit pores, similar to the regulation of protein degradation by proteasomes (van Hoof and Parker, 1999). Rrp4 and Csl4 Caps Rrp4 and Csl4 form layers of S1 and KH nucleic acid binding motifs on top of the self-compartmentalized RNase-PH domain ring and are ideally placed to regulate RNA entry into the processing chamber. Both Rrp4 and Csl4 bind to the Rrp41 subunit with their N-terminal domain and to the adjacent Rrp42 subunit with their S1/ KH or S1/zinc-ribbon domains (Figures 3A and 3E). An extended linker connects the N-terminal and the S1 domains and reaches across two adjacent Rrp41:Rrp42 dimers. In contrast, we do not find any significant interaction among the Rrp4 and Csl4 trimers. Thus, all Rrp4 and Csl4 subunits bind to the (Rrp41:Rrp42)3 assembly independently, consistent with the heterogeneity of exosomes in in vitro-reconstituted complexes and previous analysis of archaeal cells (Evguenieva-Hackenberg et al., 2003; Farhoud et al., 2005). The N-terminal domains of Rrp4 and Csl4 appear as a major anchor for the caps to the phosphorolytic ring and bind into the ``armpit'' formed by the protruding C-terminal helix of Rrp41 (Figures 3B and 3F). The core

Both exosomes contain a ring of alternating Rrp41 (blue) and Rrp42 (green) subunits. Three tungstate moieties (magenta and red cpk model) indicate three active sites in the Rrp41:Rrp42 ring. Three Rrp4 subunits (orange, with annotated NT, S1, and KH domains) or Csl4 subunits (red, with annotated N-terminal (NT), S1, and zinc-ribbon (ZN) domains plus yellow zinc ions) bind to the top face of the Rrp41Rrp42 ring in both exosome complexes, respectively. (D) A slice view through the molecular surface of the Cls4-exosome reveals the channel that proceeds from S1 domains (S1 pore) via the central processing chamber to a pore at the ° RNase-PH domains (PH pore). A 10 A narrow neck restricts the channel diameter between the S1 pore and the processing chamber.

of this interface is formed by a Pro-Gly loop that is conserved among archaeal and/or eukaryotic Rrp4, Rrp40, and Csl4 subunits, suggesting that archaeal and eukaryotic Csl4- and Rrp4-type subunits interact with the RNase-PH domain ring in a similar manner (Figures 3D and 3G). Apart from some additional conserved sidechain interactions, the remainder of the Csl4:Rrp41 and Rrp4:Rrp41 interfaces is surprisingly different. Rrp41 responds to the different N-terminal domains by conformational plasticity (e.g., Tyr241rrp41 in Figures 3B and 3F). In addition, the C-terminal helix of Rrp41 is substantially kinked in the Rrp4-exosome as compared to the Csl4-exosome due to the presence of the additional KH domain (Figures 3A and 3E). The S1 domains belong to the oligonucleotide and/or oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold proteins and possess the typical kidney-shaped, five-stranded b barrel structure (Figures 3A and 3E). In both Rrp4 and Csl4, the two S1 domains are situated at the center of the caps and interact with a radial helix on top of Rrp42. The concave sides form the perimeter of the central pore. Structural and functional data for a number of S1 and/or OB fold domains indicate that nucleic acids interact with this concave side (e.g., Shuman and Lima, 2004), raising the possibility that the central pore forms a major RNA binding site. Because the orientation of S1 domains is similar in both Csl4 and Rrp4, such a central RNA binding pore is probably also a feature of the proposed eukaryotic heterotrimeric Csl4-Rrp4-Rrp40 cap. The Rrp4 KH domain is situated on the outside of the cap (Figure 1A). The KH domain possesses the ``eukaryotic'' KH fold and packs to the convex side of the S1 domain (Figure 3A). The KH domain also interacts with the C-terminal helix of Rrp41 and the radial helix on top of Rrp42. All these interfaces exhibit a substantial hydrophobic nature, suggesting that the overall domain

arrangement of S1 and KH domains is fixed, apart from local mobility of the S1 domains (Figure 3C). Because recombinant yeast and Arabidopsis Rrp4 are found to possess some distributive hydrolytic 30 /50 RNase activity in vitro, we looked for a potential nuclease active site in KH and S1 domains. We do not find structural evidence for a hydrolytic RNase active site, and archaeal Rrp4 and Rrp4-exosomes do not possess hydrolytic RNase activity in vitro (Figure 2C). Thus, the nature of the hydrolytic activity of yeast and Arabidopsis Rrp4 remains unclear. Csl4 contains a zinc-ribbon domain instead of a KH domain (Figure 3E). Eukaryotic Csl4 lost the zinccoordinating cysteines but still contains sufficient sequence homology to predict a similar overall fold with reasonable confidence (Figure 3G). Thus, the zinc ion probably has a structural role, for instance to maintain the fold of this small domain in the harsh growth environment of archaea. Like the KH domain, the zinc-ribbon domain shares a considerable hydrophobic interface with the S1 domain. A mutation in a conserved glycine in this interface gives rise to the Ski4-1 phenotype in yeast (Figures 3E and 3G). Ski4-1 strains have normal rRNA maturation activity but are defective in mRNA degradation (van Hoof et al., 2000). The interface location of the mutation suggests that the mutual arrangement of S1 and the zinc-ribbon domain is important for mRNA degradation. In support of this, the zinc-ribbon domain is positioned between two adjacent S1 domains, toward the outside of the cap. This orientation is ideally suited to provide additional macromolecular interaction sites for recognition of RNA or protein cofactors. Macromolecular Recognition Surface S1 and KH domains form well-known protein-nucleic acid recognition motifs. The S1 and KH domains of

The side chains of notable conserved active side residues are shown as annotated color-coded sticks. Tungsten anomalous difference density is shown with 4s (yellow) and 8s (magenta) contour and indicates a possible RNA path from the central channel into the active site pocket. A tungstate moiety (WO4) is modeled into the 8s contour and may denote the position of the attacking phosphate. (C) RNase activity and polyadenylation assays. Protein, phosphate, or ADP was added as indicated, and substrate oligo(rA) 30-mer (S) and polyadenylated (PA) or phosphorolytically degraded (P) nucleotide products were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Rrp4-exosome (REx) shows that processive degradation (lanes 2 and 3) and processive polyadenylation (lane 7) of a 30-mer oligo(rA) depended on phosphate (lane 4) or ADP. Both activities are abolished or severely inhibited by the D180A mutation in the active site (lanes 6 and 9) or the R65E mutation in the neck loop (lanes 5 and 8). Controls show that Csl4-exosome (CEx, lane 12) and the Rrp41:Rrp42 complex (41:42, lanes 10 and 11) possess a similar activity, whereas Csl4 (lane 13) and Rrp4 (lane 14) subunits alone do not possess RNase activity in vitro.

AtRrp4 bind RNA in vitro, and the KH domain also possesses the typical nucleic acid-recognizing helix-turnhelix motif with the central GXXG sequence (Figures 3A and 3D) (Chekanova et al., 2002). Zinc-ribbon domains are structurally diverse but typically form proteinprotein or protein-nucleic acid recognition modules. To look for structural neighbors of the zinc-ribbon and N-terminal domains, we performed a DALI search. To our surprise, the only significant structural neighbors of zinc-ribbon and N-terminal domains turn out to be ribosomal proteins. The N-terminal domain possesses a fold similar to ribosomal protein L27 (PDB entry 1V8Q), whereas the zinc-ribbon domain most closely matches ribosomal protein L37ae (PDB entry 1FFK chain W). Both ribosomal proteins are implicated in binding to ribosomal RNA (Ban et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2004). From an evolutionary point of view, it is interesting that ribosome architecture (L27 and L37 and S1 domain proteins) and ribosome maturation (exosome cap domains) share structural features. Because all nine domains of the Csl4 and Rrp4 caps belong to domain families that are typically involved in macromolecular interactions, the caps could form a large platform that recruit macromolecular substrates and cofactors. To further characterize the molecular surface, we mapped the electrostatic potential onto the

molecular surface of the Rrp4- and Csl4-exosome complexes. Consistent with the possibility that the caps form a major RNA binding site, Rrp4 and Csl4 caps contain positive surface potential, whereas the remainder of the A. fulgidus exosome surface is highly negatively charged (Figure 4). The strongest positive potential is found in the S1 pores. Significantly, the locations of these positive patches superimpose well with characterized nucleic acid binding sites of numerous S1 and/ or OB fold domains. Evidently, the typical location of RNA binding sites on S1 domains and the matching surface charge suggest that the S1 pore is a good candidate for a major RNA binding site on the caps. The proposed RNA binding site on the KH domain, which also contains positive surface potential, is quite remote from the S1 domains and suggests that RNA binding to these two sites, if any, occurs independently. This structural implication is supported by independent RNA binding of S1 and KH domains of A. thaliana Rrp4 in vitro (Chekanova et al., 2002). Taken together, the orientation of S1, KH, and zincribbon domains suggests that the caps form a macromolecular interaction surface with two zones. The inner zone, formed by the S1 domain, would be suited to regulate RNA entry through the S1 pore and neck (see below). The function of the peripheral zone (KH and

Rrp4- ([A], top view) and Csl4-exosome ([B], top view) contain strong positive patches at the S1 and KH domains. In contrast, the exterior of the RNase-PH domain ring is highly negatively charged ([C], bottom view of the Csl4 exosome). The strongest positive potential reaches from the S1 pore via the neck loops into the processing chamber ([D]: slice view of the Rrp4 exosome), indicating a likely path for RNA. The location of the functionally important neck residue R65rrp41 is indicated by (*). The positive patches on the S1 and KH domains match the RNA binding sites of related OB fold and KH domains.

zinc-ribbon domains) is less clear. Its peripheral location might indicate that these domains are more involved in the specific recognition of RNA targets such as rRNA, mRNA, and poly(A) tails but could also be involved in the recognition of cofactors. A role in substrate and/or cofactor selection would be consistent with the Ski4-1 phenotype, where a mutation in the S1-zinc-ribbon interface specifically abolishes mRNA degradation but does not affect rRNA maturation (van Hoof et al., 2000). In support of different substrate specificities of S1 and KH domains, we find that our oligo(rA) 30-mer is more efficiently degraded by the Csl4-exosome and Cls4/Rrp4 hybrid complexes than by the Rrp4-exosome or the Rrp41:Rrp42 ring alone (Figure S4). Thus, the Rrp4/Cls4 subunits are probably involved in specificity and regulation of RNA processing.
Figure 3. The Rrp4 and Csl4 Structures

30 /50 Degradation Machineries Are Related in All Kingdoms of Life The structures of the archaeal exosome can provide a framework for the architecture of eukaryotic exosomes. The size and architecture of the archaeal exosome matches electron microscopic images and protein-protein interaction data derived for eukaryotic core exosomes (Aloy et al., 2002). For instance, the bridging of two adjacent Rrp41- and Rrp42-type subunits by Csl4 can explain the exclusive interaction of human (h) Csl4 with hRrp42 and the Rrp41-type subunit hRrp46 (Raijmakers et al., 2002b). The ring of alternating Rrp41 and Rrp42 subunits could structurally resemble alternating eukaryotic Rrp41-type (Rrp41, Mtr3, and Rrp46) and Rrp42-type (Rrp42, Rrp43, and Rrp45) subunits. AfuCsl4 matches the domain architecture of yeast

The three Rrp4 subunits are shown in red, orange, and yellow, whereas Rrp41 and Rrp42 are shown in blue and green, respectively. ° The S1 domains can at least move by 5­6 A (double-headed arrow), a distance that could allow threading of RNA one base at a time.

Figure 5. 30 /50 Processing Complexes in All Kingdoms of Life (A) A model for a heterotrimeric Csl4-Rrp4-Rrp4 cap on the molecular surface of the RNase-PH domain (gray). Placement of a Csl4 subunit (red ribbon model) into an Rrp4 cap (orange ribbon models, the third subunit is substituted by Csl4). The placement was guided by superimposing the RNase-PH domains of Rrp4- and Csl4-exosomes in silico. The model indicates that Csl4 and Rrp4 type subunits can form heterotrimeric caps without evident steric clashes, consistent with our biochemical observations. Such a model is a good approximation of the eukaryotic exosome Csl4-Rrp4-Rrp40 cap. (B) Evolutionary conservation of RNA degradation in all kingdoms of life. Ribbon representations of the Rrp4 exosome complex (only three out of nine subunits are shown) and bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase, only one out of three subunits is shown). The comparison reveals similar overall arrangement of the catalytic RNase-PH domain dimer (blue and green) and the phosphorolytic active sites (with magenta tungstate moieties). S1 (orange) and KH (yellow) domains are located at related but not identical positions with respect to the active sites. However, S1 and KH domains of PNPase are incompletely resolved and may be mobile. Whereas the precise mode of RNA recognition between PNPase and exosome probably differs to some extent, the overall mechanistic principle of RNA degradation, inferred from the domain arrangements, appears remarkably conserved.

Csl4 subunit fits well into the space between the two remaining Rrp4 subunits without the necessity of structural changes. Although we do not want to rule out that changes occur at the interface of Cls4 and Rrp4 subunits, key features derived from homotrimeric caps are probably also found in heterotrimeric caps, in particular the S1 pore that is surrounded by peripheral KH and zinc-ribbon-like domains. Our structures allow us now to fully compare RNA processing machineries in all three kingdoms of life. The structure of the RNase-PH domains and the experimentally defined tungstate binding site closely matches those of polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). PNPase is involved in 30 /50 degradation of RNA in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria (Symmons et al., 2002). Bacterial PNPase consists of a tandem repeat of RNase PH-type domains, an S1 domain, and a KH domain on a single polypeptide chain (Symmons et al., 2000). Three PNPase molecules assemble in a trimeric ring. The six RNase PH-type domains in a PNPase trimer resemble the RNase-PH ring of the exosome (Aloy et al., 2002; Lorentzen et al., 2005; Raijmakers et al., 2002a) (Figure 5B). In addition, comparison of PNPase to the archaeal exosome reveals that S1 and KH domains of both processing machineries are also located at the same side of the phosphorolytic chamber. The precise locations of S1 and KH domains appear to be different in exosome and PNPase, but the PNPase S1 and KH domains are only incompletely resolved in the available crystal structure and may be mobile. The overall architecture of exosomes and PNPases is remarkably similar, suggesting a common mechanistic basis for RNA degradation in all kingdoms of life. The Central Channel and Proposed RNA Path How does the phosphorolytic chamber process RNA? The processing chamber of the exosome contains two suitable openings, denoted PH and S1 pores. The PH pore at the bottom of the phosphorolytic ring is closer to the active sites and wider than the S1 pore. However, it does not contain recognizable RNA binding elements, it carries a strong negative surface potential, and it is far away from the putative RNA binding S1/KH domain layer (Figure 4). It is therefore unlikely that RNA enters through the PH pore. A more intriguing possibility for RNA entry is the S1 pore at the Rrp4/Csl4 cap structures. Because of highly positive electrostatic potential and the favorable location of the RNA binding S1 domains, this pore is well suited to interact with RNA (Figure 4). Consistently, the path from the putative RNA binding S1/KH domains to the active sites through the neck carries the strongest positive electrostatic potential in the archaeal exosome, and we observe strong tungsten anomalous difference density in the opening between the three neck loops (Figures 4D and 6A). This unusually broad and strong density may represent binding of a tungstate cluster and supports the idea that the neck loops could interact with a phosphate backbone. To more directly assess the functional relevance of the neck, we introduced a structure-guided mutation (R65rrp41E) and analyzed the capability of this mutant to bind and degrade a 30-mer poly(rA) substrate (Figure 2C and Figure 6B). R65rrp41 directly lines the neck, and the positive charge at this position is conserved.

Csl4, whereas afuRrp4 matches the domain architecture of yeast Rrp4 and Rrp40. Conservation of the N-terminal domain suggests that eukaryotic and archaeal Csl4- and Rrp4-type subunits associate with the RNase-PH domains in a similar manner. However, eukaryotic exosomes are proposed to contain caps that possess a Csl4-Rrp4-Rrp40 composition. To see if our homotrimeric Rrp4 and Csl4 caps are compatible with heterotrimeric caps, we substituted one Rrp4 subunit by its corresponding Csl4 subunit in silico, after structurally superimposing the two Rrp41-Rrp42 rings of the Cls4- and Rrp4-exosomes (Figure 5A). The

Figure 6. Proposed Mechanism for Core Exosomes (A) Functional analysis of the neck. Shown is a slice through the Rrp4-exosome (in colorcoded ribbon representation) with highlighted neck side chains and tungstate difference density (yellow mesh). Tungstate density and the R65rrp41E mutation (annotated) indicate that the neck region is important for RNA processing and presumably relays RNA from the S1 domains to the active sites (AS). (B) Gel shift assays of the wild-type and R65E containing Rrp4-Exosome (REx) and Rrp41: Rrp42 ring (41:42) is shown. R65E changes the shift pattern of the Rrp4-exosome (lanes 2­4 and 5­7) but abolishes RNA binding by the Rrp41:Rrp42 ring (lanes 8­10 and 11­13). The data are consistent with a model in which RNA binds to S1 and/or KH domains and enters the processing chamber in the Rrp41: Rrp42 ring via the neck containing R65. (C) Proposed model for RNA degradation and trimming by exosomes. Our structural and functional results support a model in which single-stranded RNA 30 tails reach the active sites (AS) via the S1 pore and neck. For simplicity, only two out of three active sites and S1 domains are shown. The neck and S1 pores restrict processive degradation to fully unfolded RNA substrates. Secondary structures can stall at the S1 pore and abort processive degradation. Accessory factors with helicase activity could stimulate processive degradation in part by providing unfolded, protein-deprived RNA. Sufficiently stable secondary structures of protein:RNA complexes are only trimmed, leaving a tail of about eight nucleotides that span the distance between the active sites and the S1 domains.

R65rrp41 has no evident architectural role for exosome structure or assembly, and purified Rrp4-exosomes that contain R65E have an evidently normal nine-subunit composition (data not shown). However, R65rrp41E reduces RNA degradation of exosome complexes more than 90% (Figure 2C). This indicates that R65rrp41 and the neck motif are important elements in processive ° RNA degradation although they are more than 50 A away from the phosphorolytic active sites. We also find that R65rrp41E abolishes the polyadenylation activity of exosome complexes, indicating that elongated substrates ``exit'' through the neck/S1 pore (Figure 2C, data not shown). Consistently, bacterial PNPase that carries a mutation in an equivalent neck opening is defunct in vivo. To further address the role of the neck in the mechanism of the exosome, we analyzed RNA binding by the Rrp41:Rrp42 ring and the Rrp4-exosome (Figure 6B). We find that the Rrp4-exosome and its R65E mutation bind RNA with similar affinities but have different band-shift patterns, indicating a somewhat altered RNA binding mode. This is not unexpected, because the S1 and KH RNA binding domains probably bind RNA independently from the central chamber and R65. Thus, we also analyze RNA binding by the Rrp41:Rrp42 ring alone and by its R65E mutation. In the absence of S1 and KH domains, we find that R65E completely abolishes RNA binding by the Rrp41:Rrp42 ring. The most plausible explanation for these observations is that RNA initially binds to S1 and/or KH domains and then enters the processing chamber via the neck. Taken together, these structural and functional observations strongly support a model in which RNA passes through the neck into the central chamber for 30 /50 processing.

Implications for Exosome Mechanism Our results suggest a likely mechanism for processive RNA degradation by the phosphorolytic active sites (Figure 6C). Csl4 and Rrp4 form suitable multidomain structures for substrate and/or cofactor recruitment and regulated processing. KH and zinc-ribbon domains are situated on the outside of the regulatory caps and could be involved in RNA substrate or cofactor binding. The ring of S1 domains is ideally suited to guide RNA into the neck. Furthermore, the S1 domains are sufficiently mobile to promote RNA advancement for one base at a time (Figure 3C). The proposed path of RNA indicates that the exosome should be processive on ssRNA without secondary structures. Once singlestranded RNA enters the processing chamber, the 30 tail in principle has a choice of three active sites, at least in the archaeal exosome. This high concentration of active sites, in combination with tight RNA binding at the neck and S1 domains, provides a conceivable explanation for the high processivity of exosomes on unstructured RNA. ° The neck forms a 10 A narrow pore that may just fit extended RNA, as suggested by molecular modeling (Figure S5), and would only allow entry of fully unfolded RNA. However, typical cellular RNA substrates are rarely unstructured. Thus, degradation of RNA in vivo probably requires activities that efficiently unfold RNA secondary structures and/or removes bound proteins. The yeast SKI and TRAMP complexes contain subunits that possess or are predicted to possess RNA helicase activity and stimulate processive degradation of structured RNA by the yeast exosome in vitro (Araki et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2000; LaCava et al., 2005; van Hoof et al., 2000; Wyers et al., 2005). Thus, one intriguing possibility

Molecular Cell 470

is that these accessory factors activate the exosome by providing sufficiently unstructured RNA. In addition, our model suggests that processive degradation stops at stable secondary structures or protein roadblocks that are not unwound or removed by additional factors. This may explain why the exosome degrades 7S RNA only to 6S RNA, but not to the final 5.8S RNA. Why is the exosome unable to also remove the final eight nucleotides? The distance between the S1 pore or neck ° and the active sites is about 50­60 A, a length that corresponds to w7­9 nucleotides of extended ssRNA (Inners and Felsenfeld, 1970). Thus, very stable rRNA structures or rRNA:protein complexes might simply prevent further processing because they stall at the S1 pore or neck. This stall would leave about eight nucleotides 30 to the stable secondary structure and may provide an explanation to why a much smaller nuclease (Rrp6) is needed to trim the remaining tail of 6S rRNA to form 5.8S rRNA. Finally, our structures suggest that initial threading of RNA substrates into the central chamber should be facilitated by a highly unstructured 30 tail of several nucleotides. Of course, the poly(rA) tails of mRNA and the 30 poly(rA) tails added by the TRAMP complex on nuclear RNA targets of the exosome are ideally suited for such an initial threading. Conclusions Although the RNA processing by eukaryotic exosomes is probably more complex due to additional RNase activities and cofactors, our results suggest a mechanistic framework for the RNA degradation mechanism that can explain many biochemical and structural features of archaeal and eukaryotic exosomes. This framework reveals a remarkably similar principle to protein degradation by proteasomes, a feature that has been long suspected (van Hoof and Parker, 1999). Like the proteasome, the exosome is a self-compartmentalized enzyme in which substrate biopolymers are fed through narrow entrance pores that allow efficient regulation by associated subunits and coactivators.
Experimental Procedures Protein Expression and Purification The coding sequences of Archaeoglobus fulgidus exosome subunits Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp4, and Csl4 were amplified from genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into modified pET21 and pET29 bi-cistronic expression vectors (Novagen; see Supplemental Data for primers) (Lammens et al., 2004). The resulting expression plasmids of Rrp4 and Rrp41+Rrp42 or Csl4+Rrp4 and Rrp41+Rrp42 were cotransformed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen). Cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) medium at 37ºC to an OD600 of 0.6, and gene expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After further growth overnight at 18ºC, bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in 20 mM phosphate (pH 7.8) and 200 mM NaCl, and disrupted by sonication. Incubation at 80ºC (25 min) denatured E. coli proteins. After centrifugation, the Rrp4-exosome in the supernatant was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen), Resource S ion exchange (Amersham), and S200 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham). The Csl4-exosome was purified by Resource Q ion exchange and S200 gel filtration chromatography. Selenomethioninecontaining exosomes were produced accordingly, with the exception that E. coli B834 (Rosetta [DE3]) was grown in minimal medium containing 50 mg/l L selenomethionine. All buffers for purification of the SeMet proteins were degassed before use and contained freshly added 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol.

Crystallization and Structure Determination Crystals of native Rrp4-exosome were obtained by the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing 1 ml protein (15 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris [pH 7.8] and 200 mM NaCl) and 1 ml of reservoir solution (0.1 M HEPES [pH 6.2], 35% MPD, 10 mM CaCl2, and 15% Glycerine) at 20ºC. Native Csl4-exosome (15 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris [pH 7.8], 200 mM NaCl, and 10% Glycerin) was crystallized accordingly, using 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.6), 32% MPD, and 10 mM NaCl as precipitant solution. Prior to data collection, crystals were mounted in nylon loops and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. We collected redundant single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data at the K absorption edge at beamlines ID29 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility [ESRF], Grenoble, France) and PX (Swiss Light Source [SLS], Villigen, Switzerland) and processed the datasets with the XDS program (Kabsch, 1993). Atomic positions for 57 Se atoms were independently located in Csl4 and Rrp4 datasets with the SHELX program (Schneider and Sheldrick, 2002). Phases were obtained with SHARP software (Global Phasing, Cambridge) and used as input for automated and manual model building using the programs RESOLVE/REFMAC (Terwilliger, 2002) and MAIN (Turk, 1992). Refinement was performed with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and included overall anisotropic B factor and bulk solvent corrections, individual B factor refinement, simulated annealing, and positional refinement. Initial 3-fold noncrystallographic symmetry within the exosome complexes was gradually removed at later refinement steps to account for subunit flexibility. Solvent was generated with CNS and verified by manual inspection. We omitted 5% of the reflection data from refinement for cross validation. Data collection and model statistics are summarized in Table 1. Mutagenesis and RNase Activity Assays Mutant Rrp41 was constructed by PCR, using oligonucleotides that carry the nucleotide exchange, and verified by sequencing. Mutant complexes were expressed and purified in the same way as the native complexes. We carried out RNase activity assays with a 32P 50 labeled 30-mer poly(rA)-oligoribonucleotide as substrate essentially as described (Lorentzen et al., 2005). 30 pmol RNA was labeled with 60 mCi [g-32P] ATP and 4.5 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas) in a 30 ml reaction for 1 hr at 37ºC and purified by using MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham). For each reaction, 5 or 50 pmol protein was incubated with 50 fmol of substrate in 20 ml buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.8), 60 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% Glycerine, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mg/ml BSA, 10 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.8) or 20 mM ADP, and 0.8 U/ml RNasin (Promega) for 10 min at 60ºC. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.5 volumes loading dye containing 3 M urea. The reaction products were resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel and were analyzed by phosphorimaging (Amerham). RNA Binding Assay RNA binding assays were carried out with 32P 50 -labeled 30-mer poly (rA)-oligoribonucleotide as substrate. For each reaction, 5, 2.5, or 0.25 mM protein was incubated with 50 fmol of RNA substrate in 20 ml 20 mM Tris (pH 7.8), 60 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerine, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.8 U/ml RNasin (Promega) for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction products were resolved on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel and were analyzed by phosphorimaging. (Amersham).
