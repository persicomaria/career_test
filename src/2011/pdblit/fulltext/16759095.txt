A series of (5-substituted pyrrolidinyl-2-carbonyl)-2-cyanopyrrolidine (C5-Pro-Pro) analogues was discovered as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitors as a potential treatment of diabetes and obesity. X-ray crystallography data show that these inhibitors bind to the catalytic site of DPPIV with the cyano group forming a covalent bond with the serine residue of DPPIV. The C5-substituents make various interactions with the enzyme and affect potency, chemical stability, selectivity, and PK properties of the inhibitors. Optimized analogues are extremely potent with subnanomolar Ki's, are chemically stable, show very little potency decrease in the presence of plasma, and exhibit more than 1,000-fold selectivity against related peptidases. The best compounds also possess good PK and are efficacious in lowering blood glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test in ZDF rats.
Introduction and glucose-dependent Glucagon-like peptide-1 insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP, also known as gastric inhibitory polypeptide) are two important incretins that regulate blood glucose of the body.1 After ingestion of meals, GLP-1 and GIP are released (from L-cells and K-cells, respectively) and then function through their respective receptors. Specifically, GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion,2 inhibits glucagon secretion,2c,3 and delays gastric emptying,4 each beneficial in controlling blood glucose. GIP has a similar insulinotropic effect but does not inhibit glucagon secretion or influence gastric emptying in humans.1,5 However, active GLP-1(7-36) and GIP(1-42) are inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5) rapidly.6 Two different strategies to prolong the physiological actions of GLP-1 and GIP for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have emerged: one is to use GLP-1 or GIP receptor agonists (GLP-1 or GIP mimetics) that are resistant to DPPIV degradation, the other is to inhibit DPPIV activity.7

(GLP-1a)

DPPIV (or DPP4, also known as CD26) is a ubiquitously distributed serine protease that mediates the activities of a number of regulatory peptides. It exists as both a membranebound protein and a soluble protein in plasma.8 It cleaves GLP1(7-36) to GLP-1(9-36) and GIP(1-42) to GIP(3-42) by selectively cleaving two N-terminal amino acid residues, which are important for receptor binding.6a,6b Evidence from numerous studies suggests that inhibition of DPPIV may represent a new approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DPPIV knockout mice were healthy, showed increased active GLP-1 levels, improved glucose tolerance, and were resistant to body weight gain on a high-fat diet.9 DPPIV-deficient Fisher rats also showed similar phenotypes.10 More importantly, several human clinical trials indicate that small-molecule DPPIV inhibitors are welltolerated, lower blood glucose and/or HbA1c levels, and increase glucose tolerance.11 Furthermore, there are two potential advantages for DPPIV inhibitors as therapeutic agents for diabetes. First, because the actions of GLP-1 and GIP are strictly glucose-dependent, DPPIV inhibitors are unlikely to cause serious hypoglycemia. Second, studies in Zucker diabetic rats suggest that chronic exposure to GLP-1 may increase -cell mass by promoting growth and differentiation and inhibiting apoptosis.12 Chronic treatment with DPPIV inhibitors preserved islet function in diabetic mice13 and improved -cell survival and islet cell neogenesis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.14 Both studies suggest that DPPIV inhibitors might be able to induce production of new -cells in type 2 diabetics and thus prevent the worsening of the disease. Extensive research efforts from both the academia and the pharmaceutical industry have resulted in a number of potent DPPIV inhibitors. Among them, 1 (P32/98),15 2 (DPP728),16 3 (LAF-237),17 4 (MK-0431),18 and 5 (BMS-477118)19 (Chart 1) are noteworthy and have entered into human clinical trials in diabetic patients.11,20 Here we report the discovery, structureactivity relationship (SAR), and pharmacological evaluation of

Chart 1. Structures of Selected DPPIV Inhibitors

a novel series of (5-substituted-pyrrolidinyl 2-carbonyl)-2cyanopyrrolidines (C5-Pro-Pro) as potent DPPIV inhibitors. Chemistry cis-C5-alkyl substituted pyrrolidinyl-2-cyanopyrrolidine analogues (C5-Pro-Pro) were synthesized according to Scheme 1. The lactam nitrogen of ethyl (S)-2-pyroglutamte 6 was protected and activated with a Boc group, and the resulting Boc-lactam was treated with the corresponding Grignard reagent to afford dicarbonyls 7.21 After removal of the Boc group, the resulting amines concomitantly cyclized intramolecularly with the keto group to afford imines 8. The double bond was saturated with hydrogen to yield cis-5-substituted prolines, and the nitrogen was protected with a Boc group to give proline esters 9. The ester group was hydrolyzed, and the resulting acid was coupled with (S)-2-cyanopyrrolidine, and then the Boc group was removed to afford the final products 10. (S)-Pyroglutamate 11 was transformed to alkyne 12 as a mixture of cis- and trans-isomers according to literature precedents (Scheme 2).22 The cis-isomer and trans-isomer (which differ only at C5 with the stereochemistry at C2 constant) were separated by chromatography, and each pure isomer was carried on in parallel. The methylcarbamate group of ester 12 was switched to a Boc group in two steps to give ester 13. After the TMS group was removed by TBAF, the alkyne was partially saturated to afford alkene 14. The methyl ester was hydrolyzed, and the resulting acid was coupled with (S)-2-cyanopyrrolidine to afford amide 15, which upon straightforward manipulation led to analogues 10d-f. The double bond of akene 15 was ozonolyzed to yield the key intermediate, aldehyde 16. ReducScheme 1a

tion of the aldehyde and removal of the Boc group yielded alcohols 10g and 10h. With key intermediate, aldehyde 16, in hand, a variety of final products were synthesized as shown in Scheme 3. The aldehyde was oxidized with KMnO4 to give the corresponding acid 17,23 which was coupled with amines, followed by the removal of the Boc group, to give amides 18. Reductive amination of the aldehyde and removal of the Boc group produced amines 19. Alternatively, the aldehyde was reduced to alcohol 20. The alcohol was coupled with different phenols via Mitsunobu reaction under various conditions, including diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD)/PPh3, di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD)/PPh3, and cyanomethylene tri-n-butylphosphorane (CMBP).24 The condition of di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD)/PPh3 in toluene gave the highest yield. After removal of the Boc group, ether analogues 21 were obtained. Alcohol 20 was transformed into amine 22 under optimized Mitsunobu conditions, which was further diversified to afford amide 23, ureas 24, and sulfonamide 25. The nitro group of Boc ethers 26 was reduced with iron powder and the resulting anilines 27 were either acylated or sulfonylated to give 21ar and 21as. The syntheses of the requisite phenol intermediates are shown in Scheme 4. Treatment of phenols 28 with tetrabutylammonium tribromide gave bromides 29. The bromides were carbonylated in methanol to afford the corresponding methyl esters, which were hydrolyzed to give acids 30. Treatment of the acids with N,N-dimethylformamide di-tert-butyl acetal in heated benzene or toluene afforded phenols 31. Methyl ester 32 underwent an ester exchange to give tert-butyl ester 33, which was chlorinated with N-chlorosuccinamide (NCS) to yield chlorophenol 34. 2-Chloro-4-methanesulfonyl phenol 36a was prepared by chlorination with chlorine generated in situ (KClO4 in hydrochloric acid).25 2-Bromo-4-methanesulfonyl phenol 36b was made by treating the phenol with tetrabutylammonium tribromide. Results and Discussion Establishment of Pharmacophore and Improvement of Potency. At the outset of our program, unsubstituted 2-cyanopyrrolidine 10a (Table 1) was reported to be a reasonably potent DPPIV inhibitor with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 20 nM, albeit with poor chemical stability (vide infra).26 Modification at C4 position of the P2 pyrrolidine was recently reported to yield potent inhibitors.27 Alternatively, upon analyzing the structures of more potent inhibitors, cyanopyrrolidine 2 (Chart 1) and compound 10a, it occurred to us that if the P2 pyrrolidine moiety of compound 10a could serve as a rigidified linker to replace the flexible aminino side chain of cyanopyrrolidine 2, of the P2 pyrrolidine ring could be modified to improve potency

and other properties. To our delight, when a cis-C5-methyl group was introduced, the resulting compound 10b was a very potent DPPIV inhibitor with an inhibition constant of 8.3 nM. Both an ethyl and an unsaturated vinyl chain were also tolerated (compounds 10c and 10e), although the potency decreased as the chain became longer (compare 10c to 10b). Branching of the C5 chain was detrimental to the potency (compounds 10i and 10j). A free hydroxyl group (10g) decreased potency dramatically. The stereochemistry of the C5-substitution was critical, as evidenced by the fact that none of the 2,5-trans

analogues (10d, 10f, and 10h) is more potent than their corresponding 2,5-cis analogues (10c, 10e, and 10g). After establishing the regio- and stereochemistry of the substituents on the P2 pyrrolidine with relatively simple alkyl/ aryl substituents, we then started to explore more elaborate substituents at the C5 position. When an amide was used as the linker between the phenyl ring and the P2 pyrrolidine ring, the resulting amide 18a was a very weak DPPIV inhibitor (Table 2). A 4-bromo substitution on the phenyl ring did not improve potency (18b). The reversed amide 23, extended with a

methylene spacer, turned out to be a much better inhibitor, with a Ki of 20 nM. Ureas 24a and 24b were also very potent (15 and 6.7 nM, respectively). Sulfonamide 25 was slightly weaker, with a Ki of 44 nM. With this set of data, we speculated that the main reason for the dramatic decrease in potency of amides 18a and 18b was the reduced basicity of the amino group of the P2 pyrrolidinyl group (due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the R-carbonyl of the amide group), as the interaction between this amine and two glutamate residues of the enzyme is critical (vide infra). The corresponding amine analogues turned out to be very potent, with 19a showing a Ki of 12 nM (entry 7). The p-bromophenyl analogue 19b showed a Ki of less than 10 nM. While branching at the nitrogen atom (tertiary amine 19c) decreased potency, introduction of cyclic aliphatic morpholine was extremely detrimental to the potency (19d). The most potent analogues came when an ether was used as the linker, with the unsubstituted phenyl analogue 21a showing a Ki of 6.8 nM. The p-bromo substituent provided a similar level of potency (21b). Consistent with the SAR observed in the simple alkyl-

substituted analogues, the trans-analogue 21c was significantly less potent than the corresponding cis-analogue 21b, again demonstrating the significance of the stereochemistry at the C5. Further exploration within the ether-linked series suggested that a phenyl ether was much better than the corresponding benzyl analogue 21d (Table 3). While electron-donating groups at the para-position of the phenyl group caused little change in potency (21e and 21f), an electron-withdrawing group was welltolerated (21g). On the other side, at the ortho-position, both electron-donating (21h) and electron-withdrawing (21i) groups improved potency, with the Ki of the 2-chlorophenyl analogue

21i (entry 7) reaching the subnanomolar level (0.85 nM). Subsequently, X-ray crystallography demonstrated that the 2-chloro atom forms a number of unique interactions with the enzyme (vide infra). However, when both of the ortho-positions of the phenyl ring were substituted, the potency suffered dramatically (21j). When both ortho- and para-positions were substituted, the resulting analogues (21k and 21l) showed excellent potency. An ionizable carboxylic acid group was also tolerated at the ortho-position (21m). A heterocyclic ring (21n), as well as bicyclic rings (21o and 21p), also provided very potent inhibitors. Tetrahydronaphthyl group (21q, entry 15) was not tolerated, presumably due to steric reasons. Chemical Stability. It's known that cyanopyrrolidines can suffer from instability in that the P2 amino group (either in a ring or open chain) attacks the cyano group under neutral or basic conditions (eq 1) and the resulting cyclized imidate 38 or

diketopiperizine 39 are inactive as DPPIV inhibitors.17 Steric hindrance in close proximity to the P2 amino group is known to modulate the rate of the intramolecular cyclization and hence stability.28 To assess the stability, the inhibitors were incubated in pH 7.4 buffer at 37 °C. The concentration of the parent compound was then measured using HPLC at various time points, and a half-life (t1/2) was calculated using a pseudo-firstorder kinetic model. As shown in Table 4, C5-unsubstituted cyanopyrrolidine 10a was very unstable, with a half-life of only 1.3 h (entry 1). Methyl substitution at C5 of the P2 pyrrolidine dramatically increased the half-life to 6.5 h (entry 2). As the size of the C5-substituent increased from methyl to ethyl and isopropyl groups, the half-life increased to 16.5 h and >100 hours, respectively (entries 3 and 4). Unfortunately, the potency of these simple C5-alkyl substituted analogues decreased as the stability increased. The 4-bromophenyl ether 21b had a halflife of 7.8 h. The analogue with a naphthyl group (21p) had a half-life of 10.8 h (entry 6). When o-chlorophenyl analogue 21k (with an 2-chloro substituent) was tested, the half-life (16.7 h) confirmed what we suspected: the ortho-substituent on the aromatic ring, although far away form the P2 pyrrolidinylamine, indeed modulated the chemical stability of these C5-Pro-Pro analogues. Therefore, we had identified a position to modify that allowed potency and stability to be simultaneously increased. The trend was born out by 21aa (t1/2 of 41.2 h, entry 8) where a bulky tert-butyl group was introduced (for structure, see Table 5), though there was a limit to what ortho-substituent was tolerated, as evidenced by the total loss of potency by 21ab (Ki > 3 µM).

a K is the inhibition constant (K ) measured in our "normal" assay where i i Michaelis-Menten kinetics holds. Ki (TB) is the inhibition constant (Ki) measured in the tight-binding assay; Ki (TB, 10% PL) is Ki measured in the tight-binding assay with 10% rat plasma. For details, see the Experimental Section. b All Ki values are an average of at least two runs.

The next improvement came when a carboxylic acid group was introduced at the para-position of the phenyl ring, leading to compound 21ac with slightly better potency (entry 3 vs entry

1, Table 5) and stability (entry 11 vs entry 8, Table 4) and better PK profile (vide infra). We therefore synthesized a large number of analogues with a carboxylic group incorporated at various positions and on various aromatic rings (Table 5). Isopropylphenylcarboxylic acid 21ad (entry 4) had an excellent potency of 2 nM. As we were able to consistently make extremely potent inhibitors, the enzymatic kinetics could no longer be analyzed using the Michaelis-Menten model, and a tight-binding analysis model had to be used instead.29 This model accounts for the reduction in concentration of free inhibitor due to enzymeinhibitor complex formation, wherease the Michaelis-Menten model assumes that the free inhibitor and total inhibitor are identical. The effect of using the Michaelis-Menten model in a tight-binding situation is to make compounds appear less potent than they actually are. Therefore, a tight binding assay was used to accurately measure the inhibition constants [Ki(TB)] for these very potent inhibitors (Ki e 2 nM). Within the ortho-substituted p-acid subseries (entries 3-6, Table 5), 2-chlorophenyl acid 21ae was the most potent so far (1.5 nM). It should be noted that the chemical stabilities of these analogues were well-maintained (entries 10, 11 of Table 4). When the acid group was moved from the para- to the meta-position, the resulting acid 21ag (0.67 nM) had about the same potency as isomer 21ae, but exhibited improved selectivity against other peptidases (vide infra). Here the beneficial effect of an acid group on chemical stability was most evident in that the halflife of 21ag was >100 h compared to the half-life of the corresponding analogue 21k of 16.7 h. Similar potency levels were observed with the corresponding 2-bromo analogues (Ki ) 0.40 nM for 21ah and Ki ) 0.48 nM for 21ai). When pyridinyl groups with different substitution patterns were incorporated, the resulting analogues (21aj and 21ak) turned out to be the most potent inhibitors (0.59 and 0.48 nM, respectively). The corresponding N-oxide 21al maintained most of the potency of the "parent" compound. The two (nonionizable) sulfones (21am, and 21an) were also very potent DPPIV inhibitors, with Ki(TB)'s reaching subnanomolar levels. Bicyclic rings such as methylenedioxyphenyl and naphthyl with orthosubstituents (21ao and 21ap) were well-tolerated, as was a nitro group (21aq). Further extension of the phenyl ring at the aniline position with fairly large groups such as phenylsulfonyl (21ar) and pyrazole amido (21as) was well-accommodated by the enzyme, with 21as (entry 18) reaching a Ki of 270 pM in our tight binding assay. These very potent inhibitors (Ki e 2 nM) were tested in our plasma shift assay, using the tight binding analysis, where either 0% or 10% (v/v) of rat plasma was used as part of our screening paradigm. A compound with high plasma protein binding is expected to show a large shift in Ki values [Ki(TB,10%PL) > Ki(TB)], whereas a compound with low protein binding will show a minimum shift [Ki(TB,10%PL)  Ki(TB)]. As can be seen (Table 5), most of the potent inhibitors showed very little shift in the presence of plasma (e.g. 21ad, 21ah, 21aj, and 21ak), which is consistent with the fact that many of them showed low protein binding in a direct protein-binding assay (data not shown). There are a few others that showed some shift (e.g. 21ar and 21as) in the presence of plasma. It was observed that, qualitatively, compounds with larger cLogP values (data not shown) tended to have a larger shift of potency. Pharmacokinetic Profile. Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of a few selected analogues tested in Sprague-Dawley rats are shown in Table 6. The 5-methyl analogue 10b showed a very high clearance (iv) and low area under curve (AUC) when dosed orally. 2-Chloro-4-cyanophenyl analogue 21k (entry 2) showed

an increased AUC and decreased clearance, albeit with a high maximal concentration (Cmax) and a short terminal half-life (t1/2) of 1.5 h when dosed orally. The beneficial effect of the acid group can be clearly seen by comparing 21ac to 21aa: while 21aa showed a dismal AUC of 28 ng h/kg and oral bioavailability (F) of 3%, acid 21ac showed a dramatically improved PK profile with AUC of 9633 ng h/kg and F of 63%. The same trend held for the isopropylphenyl acid 21ad (entry 5). Pyridinyl acid 21ak showed a very low AUC, probably due to poor absorption, since plasma clearance was low (0.96 L/h kg) when dosed intravenously (iv). The other selective compound 21ag (entry 8) exhibited a reasonable exposure as measured by oral AUC (1278 ng h/kg) and a much longer half-life (6.9 h), although the oral bioavailability was very low. Sulfone 21an showed improved PK over the corresponding cyano analogue 21k in that it had a slightly longer half-life (2.2 h) and a slightly lower Cmax. Naphthyl acid 21aq had a reasonable exposure as measured by AUC and a reasonable half-life. Selectivity. There are a number of other dipeptidyl peptidases in the body, and although the function of most of these peptidases remains unknown at present, there is evidence indicating that selectivity over other peptidases, especially over DPP8/9, may be important.30 We screened our potent DPPIV inhibitors for selectivity against DPP7 (also known as DPP2 and QPP),31 DPP8,32 DPP9,33 prolyl oligopeptidases (POP),34 and fibroblast activation protein R (FAPR, also called seprase).35 Although our understanding of the origin of selectivity is limited due to scarce structural information on these peptidases other than DPPIV, a few structural features of the inhibitors seem to affect selectivity and are noted as follows. First, all the inhibitors were selective against DPP7, with the least selective analogue 21am (entry 6, Table 7) showing a 500-fold selectivity. At the ortho-position of the phenyl ring, introduction of a chloro substitution improved selectivity over DPP9 modestly and over POP significantly (entry 2 vs 1). Introduction of a neutral nitrile group at the para-position of the phenyl ring decreased selectivity, especially against DPP9 and POP (entry 3 vs 2). Second, introduction of an acid group in the para-position of the phenyl ring improved the selectivity over POP (entry 4 vs 3). Naphthyl acid 21ap and sulfone 21am (entries 5 and 6) had reasonable selectivity against peptidases other than DPP9. Third, when the acid group was moved from the para- to meta-position, selectivity improved across the board, leading to 21ag with a selectivity larger than 360-fold against all the peptidases tested (entry 7). Last, replacing the phenyl ring with a pyridinyl ring increased selectivity, leading to pyridine 21ak and the corresponding N-oxide 21al with selectivities greater than 1,000fold over all the enzymes tested (entries 8 and 9).

a K values (nM) in tight-binding assay for each enzyme are reported i and the fold of selectivity is shown in the parentheses. b Ki values for DPPIV are from tight-binding assay. For structures of the compounds, see Tables 1, 2, 3 and 5.

Binding Mode. Recombinant human DPPIV was prepared as described by Rasmussen and co-workers36 and the protein was crystallized for structural analysis by X-ray crystallography.

Inhibitor complexes were obtained by soaking crystals in the presence of compounds, and structures were well-defined with high-resolution diffraction data.37 As can be seen in Figure 1, these cyanopyrrolidine inhibitors bind in the active site with the nitrile group, forming a covalent bond with the hydroxyl group of the active site serine, Ser630.38 Consistent with the known binding of the P2 amino group of peptide inhibitors to two glutamates, we observe the amino group of the P2 pyrrolidine in close proximity to the side chains of Glu205 and Glu206. However, crystal structures of three compounds with different linkers and substituents on the phenyl ring exhibit quite different conformations. The structure of 21ac shows that the tert-butyl moiety is in position for a close hydrophobic contact with the side chain of Phe357, and the edge of the phenyl ring is oriented toward Arg125. In the case of m-acid 21ag, the phenyl ring stacks face to face with the guanidine moiety of Arg125 for a - interaction. The o-chloro atom is positioned within van der Waals contact of the OH group of Tyr547 (3.6 Å) and the imidate nitrogen (3.7 Å). The potency gain exhibited by analogues bearing an o-chloro substitutent may be a combination of effects, including van der Waals contacts with neighboring atoms and an electronic effect upon the -stacking interaction. The m-carboxylate group is oriented favorably for a polar interaction with the side chain of His126. This carboxylate group not only boosted potency, but also increased

Figure 2. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of female ZDF rats dosed with 21ad orally. Female ZDF rats (n ) 10/group) of 10 weeks of age were dosed with either vehicle or DPPIV inhibitor 21ad. Four hours later (t ) 0), the rats were given glucose at 2 g/kg and then the blood glucose levels were measured. Plasma glucose change from baseline is shown in the left panel and area under curve (AUC) change (from t ) 0 to t ) 120) is shown in the right panel.

selectivity modestly over other peptidases, suggesting differences in interactions among enzyme family members in this region. In contrast to the ether-linked analogues of 21ac and 21ag, the structure of 24b has a urea-linked aryl that binds differently. In this case the phenyl moiety binds face to face with the side chain of Tyr547 in position for a - stacking interaction. These structures demonstrate the diversity of interactions that the compounds make with the enzyme. In Vivo Pharmacology. Inhibitors were chosen to be evaluated in oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) based on their overall properties of potency, stability, and PK. After an overnight fast, female Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats of 10 weeks of age were dosed with either vehicle or a DPPIV inhibitor orally at different dosages. Four hours later (t ) 0), the rats were administered glucose (2 g/kg) via oral gavage and the blood glucose levels were measured at six time points in the course of 2 h. The results with acid 21ad-treated rats are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, blood glucose levels of the rats dosed with DPPIV inhibitor 21ad were lowered compared to those of the rats dosed with vehicle. The effect was dosedependent, demonstrating a statistically significant difference beginning at the 1 mg/kg dose. The reduction of glucose excursion as measured by area under the curve (AUC) from t ) 0 to t ) 120 min increased from 17% to 30% when the dose was increased from 1 to 3 mg/kg. In summary, a series of (5-substituted-pyrrolidinyl-2-carbonyl)-2-cyanopyrrolidines (C5-Pro-Pro) was discovered as DPPIV inhibitors. X-ray crystallography data show that they bind to the catalytic site of DPPIV with the cyano group forming a covalent bond with the serine residue of DPPIV. The C5substituents make various interactions with the enzyme and affected potency, selectivity, and PK properties of the inhibitors. The optimized analogues are extremely potent (achieving subnanomolar Ki), are chemically stable, show very little potency decrease in the presence of plasma, and exhibit greater than 1000-fold selectivity against related peptidases. The compounds with good PK are efficacious in lowering blood glucose in an acute oral glucose tolerance tests in ZDF rats. Experimental Section
Partial Purification of Human DPPIV. Caco-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (P.O. Box 3605, Manassas, VA), cultured, and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in low glucose DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic/antimycotic. In preparation for making an extract, cells were seeded at a density to achieve confluence within

7 days. The cells were cultured for an additional 14 days to allow for maximal DPPIV expression. On the day of harvest, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's PBS and solubilized in a 10 mM NaCl containing 50 mM Tris HCl, 0.5% Nonidet P40, and 0.3 µg/ mL aprotinin at pH 8.0. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 35 000g for 30 min at 4 °C. Inhibition Constant (Ki). DPPIV activity was determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of a surrogate substrate, Gly-Pro7-amidomethylcoumarin (Gly-Pro-AMC, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The assay was carried out at room temperature in black 96-well polypropylene or polyethylene plates in a total volume of 100 µL per well. Appropriate dilutions of the compounds were made in DMSO and then diluted 10-fold into buffer. Aliquots (10 µL) of five concentrations of the inhibitor or 10% DMSO in buffer were added to individual wells containing 80 µL of DPPIV diluted in assay buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.12 mg/mL BSA. After 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was initiated by adding 10 µL of either 280, 700, 1750, or 3500 µM Gly-Pro-AMC in water. The DPPIV activity resulted in the formation of the fluorescent product amidomethylcoumarin (AMC), which was continuously monitored by excitation at 355 nm and measurement of fluorescent emission at 460 nm every 112 s for 37 min using an appropriate plate reader. The fluorescence at 460 nm was converted to nanomoles of AMC using a standard curve, and the steady-state rate of AMC formation was calculated. For each concentration of inhibitor or DMSO control, the steadystate rates were used to fit a rectangular hyperbola, from which apparent KM (Michaelis constant) and maximal velocity (Vmax) values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (PRISM, GraphPad Software). The ratio of the apparent KM/Vmax vs inhibitor concentration was plotted and the negative X-intercept, as calculated by linear regression, was the competitive Ki. Tight-Binding Inhibition Constant Determination. A tight binding situation exists when there is a significant portion of the inhibitor present as enzyme-inhibitor complex, and the concentration of free inhibitor can no longer be approximated by the concentration of total inhibitor, as is the case for the MichaelisMenten kinetics. In such cases, Ki (Kic, competitive inhibition constant) values were computed by nonlinear regression fitting of velocities to the Morrison and Stone equation39 V ) A{[(Kip + It - Et)2 + 4KipEt]1/2 - (Kip + It - Et)} where A ) kcatS/(2(KM + S), It ) total inhibitor concentration, Et ) total enzyme concentration, S ) total substrate concentration, and Kip ) Kic(1 + S/KM). For these reactions, enzyme concentration was 200 pM, S was 200 µM, and the velocities were determined by monitoring reactions for up to 2 h and using the linear portion of the reaction progress curve. The Michaelis constant, KM, was

previously determined to be 50 µM in the studies that determined the inhibition constant under Michaelis-Menten conditions. Chemical Stability Assay. Reverse-phase HPLC methods were developed for each compound. The chromatography was isocratic through a Phenomenex Synergi RP polar, 4.6 × 250 mm, 4-µm column at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was 90-100 µL, and the UV detection wavelengths used were 210, 240, and 257 nm. The autosampler was set to 37 °C ((2 °C) and the column exposed to ambient temperature. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 0.1% perchloric acid or 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2.5. The mobile phase ratio of organic:aqueous varied according to the compound. The retention time and peak shape of parent compound were optimized to between 8 and 34 min by adjusting the mobile phase ratio. Stability solutions were prepared in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 adjusted to µ ) 0.155. Samples were weighed using a Mettler-Toledo microbalance and transferred into a 20-mL glass scintillation vial or a volumetric flask. The phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was added with an EDP Plus 10 mL electronic pipet. The samples were sonicated for approximately 2 min and filtered using a PTFE membrane syringe filter. Aliquots of the filtrate were transferred to a set of amber HPLC vials and placed in an autosampler maintained at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by HPLC with the first sample injected denoted as the time zero sample. The peak area response of the remaining samples was measured as a function of time. After data acquisition was completed, the chromatograms were processed for each compound using Beckman Peak Pro software CALS version 8.4a. Reaction was analyzed using a first-order kinetic model, where a plot of log(peak area remaining/peak area at zero time) vs exposure time at 37 °C is linear. The rate constant and half-life were obtained from a linear fit to the plot using Microsoft Excel 2000. Pharmacokinetics (PK) in Rats. Compounds were prepared as solutions in ethanol/propylene glycol/D5W vehicles (10/30/60 v/v) at concentrations appropriate for a 1 mL/kg dose volume for intravenous (iv) or oral administration. Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Portage, MI) were fasted overnight prior to dosing and for the first 12 h of the study but were permitted free access to water. The 5 mg/kg iv dose was administered as a slow bolus in a jugular vein under light ether anesthetic while the 5 mg/kg oral dose was administered by gavage. Serial EDTA blood samples were obtained from a tail vein of each animal 0.1 (iv only), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h after drug administration. Plasma was separated by centrifugation (16 000 rpm × 4 min, 4 °C) and stored frozen (<-15 °C) until analysis. Compounds were separated from the plasma using protein precipitation with methanol and acetonitrile. A plasma aliquot (100 µL, sample or spiked standard) was combined with 150 µL of internal standard (prepared in methanol) and 150 µL of acetonitrile. The samples were vortexed vigorously for 1 min followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min (4 °C). An aliquot of the supernatant (100 µL) was transferred to a clean 96-well plate and diluted with 500 µL of 1% acetic acid in water. Samples were analyzed simultaneously with spiked plasma standards. The parent compound and the internal standard were separated from each other and coprecipitated contaminants on a 100 × 3 mm Kromasil 3-µm column (Higgins) with an acetonitrile/1% aqueous acetic acid mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Analysis was performed on a Sciex API4000 Biomolecular Mass Analyzer with a turbo-ionspray interface. Analytes were ionized in the positive ion mode with a source temperature of approximately 400 °C. Detection was in the multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. Peak areas were determined using the Sciex Analyst software. The plasma drug concentration of each sample was calculated by least squares linear regression analysis (weighted as 1/concentration) of the peak area ratio (parent/internal standard) of the spiked plasma standards versus concentration. Protein X-ray Crystallography Analysis Methods. Purified human DPPIV(39-766) was crystallized according to conditions described in the literature.36 Complexes were prepared by soaking crystals in the presence of compound and preserved in liquid nitrogen for data collection at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were

collected at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory on the IMCA beamline 17-ID with an ADSC quantum 210 detector and reduced using the program HKL2000.40 Structures were solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP using atomic coordinates with pdb accession code 1N1M.41 Models were fit to electron density maps that revealed density for compounds, and structures were refined against all available data using the programs QUANTA and CNX (Accelrys). Compound Synthesis. Unless otherwise specified, all solvents and reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further drying or purification. All reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere unless otherwise noted. Normal-phase flash chromatography was done using Merck silica gel 60 (230400 mesh) from E. M. Science or was performed on an Analogix IntelliFlash system with prepacked columns. Reverse-phase preparative chromatography was performed using a Gilson HPLC system equipped with a Gilson 215 liquid handler and a Waters Nova-Pak column 25 × 100 mm C18 column. Fraction collection was triggered by UV absorption at 214 nm. In a number of cases, the crude reaction mixture was reduced in volume (if necessary) and then dissolved in 1/1 MeOH/DMSO and purified by reverseHPLC without any workup. Final products were eluted as TFA salts with linear gradient 0-70% CH3CN/H2O with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the aqueous phase. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with 300 and 500 MHz spectrometers; all chemical shift () values were referenced to tetramethylsilane as an internal standard and are reported as shift (multiplicity, coupling constants, proton count). Mass spectral analysis was accomplished using fast atom bombardment (FAB), electrospray (ESI), or direct chemical ionization (DCI) ionization techniques. All elemental analyses were done at QTI and are consistent with theoretical values to within (0.4% unless otherwise indicated. Method A. Synthesis of cis-5-Alkyl-Substituted Prolines. Method A1. Ethyl N-Boc (S)-pyroglutamate (2.33 g, 9.06 mmol)42 was dissolved in 6 mL of THF, and the mixture was cooled to -40 °C. Ethylmagnesium bromide solution (1.0 M in THF, 10.84 mL, 10.84 mmol) was added slowly via a syringe. After 2 h, the reaction flask was placed in a freezer (ca. -20 °C) overnight. Saturated aqueous NH4Cl and 1 N HCl were added, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×). The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4, concentrated, and purified by flash chromatography (30% EtOAc/hexane) to provide keto ester 7c (2.018 g, 78%): 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3)  1.06 (t, J ) 7.46 Hz, 3 H), 1.28 (t, J ) 7.12 Hz, 3 H), 1.44 (s, 9 H), 1.82-1.97 (m, 1 H), 2.06-2.19 (m, 1 H), 2.43 (q, J ) 7.46 Hz, 2 H), 2.51 (q, J ) 7.57 Hz, 2 H), 4.19 (q, J ) 7.12 Hz, 2 H), 4.21 (br m, 1H), 5.06 (br s, 1 H) ppm; MS (ESI), m/z 310 (M + Na)+.

Iodotrimethylsilane (6.4 mL, 42.9 mmol) was added to the solution of cis-12 22 (10.15 g, 35.8 mmol) in chloroform (20 mL). The mixture was stirred at 65 °C for 1.5 h. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by column chromatography (50%-60% EtOAc/hexane) to give the corresponding amine (7.4 g, 93%): 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3)  0.15 (s, 9 H), 2.07-2.49 (m, 5 H), 3.70 (s, 3 H), 3.87-4.02 (m, 2 H) ppm; MS (DCI) m/z 226 (M + H)+. The above amine (7.4 g, 32.9 mmol) and di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (8.6 g, 39.8 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL) and then triethylamine (7.2 mL) was added.
