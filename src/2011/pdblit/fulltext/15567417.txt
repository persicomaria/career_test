Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated gene 8 (NEDD8) is a recently discovered ubiquitin-like posttranslational modifier. NEDD8 acts predominantly as a regulator of ubiquitin­ protein ligases and as a decoy for proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation. It thereby controls key events in cell cycle progression and embryogenesis. Deneddylase-1 (DEN1/NEDP1/SENP8) features a selective peptidase activity converting the proNEDD8 precursor to its mature form and an isopeptidase activity deconjugating NEDD8 from substrates such as cullins and p53. In this study, we describe a highthroughput screening (HTS)-compatible time-resolved fluorescent resonance energy transfer (TR­FRET) assay measuring the peptidase activity of DEN1.

NEDDylation is a process of reversible posttranslational protein modification and involves an enzymatic cascade for the conjugation and deconjugation of neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated gene 8 (NEDD8),3 very similar to the ubiquitin system [1]. NEDD8 is a 9-kDa polypeptide that shares 80% sequence homology with ubiquitin. NEDD8, like ubiquitin, is synthesized as precursor protein with a C-terminal extension [2]. However, a single amino acid mismatch in the otherwise sequence identical C termini of NEDD8 (Ala72) and ubiquitin (Arg72) underlies the specific recognition of NEDD8 by the heterodimeric E1-activating enzyme APPBP1­UBA3 and the deneddylase DEN1 (deneddylase-1) [3,4]. The binding of NEDD8 to APPBP1­UBA3 and DEN1 is mediated via extensive protein interfaces and induces extensive conformational changes in all binding partners, thereby stimulating the catalytic activity of DEN1. DEN1 is a cysteine protease that plays a dual role in the NEDD8 system [5]. First, DEN1 features an isopeptidase activity deconjugating NEDD8 from a wide variety of substrates, including cullins

and p53 [5­7]. Second, the same catalytic site of DEN1 has a peptidase activity that acts on proNEDD8 precursors to generate the Cterminal conjugation motif LRGG [5]. The main function of NEDD8 conjugation appears to be the regulation of protein stability either indirectly by modulating ubiquitin ligase activities or directly by marking protein substrates for proteasomal degradation [8,9]. Small molecule inhibitors of DEN1 are wanted to facilitate the interrogation of the intracellular NEDD8 network and to investigate the potential of DEN1 as a cancer drug target. Here we present a time-resolved fluorescent resonance energy transfer (TR­FRET)-based assay to measure the processing of proNEDD8 by DEN1 in a high-throughput screening (HTS)-compatible, high-density, 1536-well plate assay format. By using full-length proNEDD8 as opposed to short oligopeptide substrates mimicking the C-terminal end of NEDD8, this assay takes advantage of the increased catalytic activity of DEN1 toward its protein substrates and is tailored to target the most physiologically relevant and substrate selective enzyme conformation [4]. Relative to assays relying on straight fluorescence intensity measurements and using, for example, C-terminally labeled ubiquitin constructs [10­12], TR­FRET assays are less prone to fluorescence interference and, therefore, are especially well suited for the screening of large diverse compound libraries [13,14]. Moreover, TR­FRET assay formats are generally highly sensitive at low target concentrations in the picomolar to nanomolar range and low assay volumes of around 10 ll and less. The principle of the featured DEN1 activity assay is illustrated in Fig. 1A. Unprocessed DEN1 substrate His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG is quantified by TR­FRET through interactions with anti-Myc­ Eu­cryptate- and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-FLAG

His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG was either left untreated (Co) or incubated with 10 nM GST­DEN1 for 8 h after DEN1 had been preincubated with either dimethyl sulfoxide (Co + DEN1), 100 nM NEDD8­vinylsulfone (VS), 30 mM iodoacetamide (IA), or 30 mM maleimide (MI) for 30 min.

antibodies. After excitation with ultraviolet (UV) light at 340 nm, Eu­cryptate is able to transfer energy to the adjacent acceptor (APC), which can emit light at 665 nm. Energy that is not transferred is emitted from Eu at 615 nm. The intensity of light emitted by the APC acceptor at 665 nm, or alternatively the 665/620-nm intensity ratio, is a measure for the relative His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG concentration. DEN1-mediated substrate cleavage decreases the TR­FRET signal. Materials required for the assays were obtained as follows. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)­DEN1 was expressed and purified as described previously [5]. His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG was PIPEcloned into pSpeedET [15] using the forward primer AACCTGTACTTCCAGGGCATGGAACAAAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTG and the reverse primer GAGTTAATTAAGTCGCGTTATCACTTGTCATCGT CGTCTTTGTAGTC, expressed in Escherichia coli TOP10, and purified by affinity chromatography using first nickel­nitrilotriacetate (Ni­ NTA) and then anti-FLAG M2 sepharose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) to ensure the presence of both the N- and C-terminal tags necessary for TR­FRET detection. The initial nickel column purification yielded three bands: the full-length His­Myc­NEDD8­FLAG and two bands that migrated slightly lower and appeared to be C-ter-

minal cleavage fragments based on Coomassie and anti-His Western blot analyses. Based on Coomassie blue staining, approximately two-thirds of this material appears to be the fulllength protein, whereas the remaining one-third is the truncated material. Therefore, the subsequent anti-FLAG purification was deemed necessary. Anti-c-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies for Western blot analysis were purchased from MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH, USA) and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA), respectively. The Eu­ cryptate-conjugated anti-Myc­Eu and the APC (XL665)-conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Cisbio­US (Bedford, MA, USA). The TR­FRET assays were performed at least in triplicates using white solid-bottom 1536-well plates (Greiner, San Diego, CA, USA) in a final detection volume of 10 ll. NEDD8­ vinylsulfone (VS) was purchased from Boston Biochem (Cambridge, MA, USA), and iodoacetamide and maleimide were purchased from Sigma. Before attempting the development of a microtiter plate assay, we first confirmed the activity and selectivity of our GST­DEN1 enzyme preparation by Western blot analysis, looking at both the Nterminal Myc tag and the C-terminal FLAG tag of the His6­Myc­ proNEDD8­FLAG substrate construct (Fig. 1B). The peptidase reaction was performed at room temperature using 750 nM substrate in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.05% Chaps (buffer A). Both DEN1 concentration and time-dependent C-terminal proNEDD8 processing could be observed and followed through the occurrence of a distinct truncated NEDD8 species that maintained its N-terminal Myc tag (Fig. 1B and C). At higher DEN1 concentrations or longer incubation times, the His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG turnover could also be registered in the anti-FLAG blots as a weakening of the unprocessed precursor substrate band (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Protease inhibitors were tested to further validate the specificity of this assay (Fig. 1D). We found that not only the pan-cysteine protease inhibitors iodoacetamide and maleimide but also the DEN1-specific inhibitor NEDD8­VS abrogated the proteolytic processing of proNEDD8. This result demonstrates the dependence of the proteolysis reaction on the specific DEN1 peptidase activity and eliminated possible contaminants in GST­DEN1 preparation as major contributors to the reaction. Next, the peptidase activity of DEN1 was measured in a 1536well plate TR­FRET assay (Fig. 1A) in a final reaction volume of 10 ll per well. The enzyme reaction was performed in a 4-ll volume in buffer A and was followed by the addition of an antiMyc­Eu/anti-FLAG­APC antibody mix diluted in reconstitution buffer (Cisbio­US). Relative anti-Myc­Eu and anti-FLAG­APC (data not shown) and His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG concentrations were optimized for maximal TR­FRET signal/noise (S/N) detection. Fig. 2A shows titrations of His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG at various incubation times post- antibody addition. Ternary antibody­substrate complex formation equilibrated after 2 h of room temperature incubation. At fixed concentrations of 2 nM anti-Myc­Eu and 10 nM anti-FLAG­APC, increasing His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG concentrations between 3 and 100 nM resulted in correspondingly increased TR­FRET signals. At higher His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG concentrations, a hook effect set in (Fig. 2A). Based on the time-dependent decline of the TR­FRET signal at concentrations of 100 pM GST­DEN1 and 75 nM His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG (Fig. 2B), the effects of a number of DEN1 inhibitors on the DEN1 peptidase activity were tested at a 6 h endpoint (Fig. 2C). DEN1 activity was completely inhibited by 100 pM NEDD8­VS as well as by 1 mM iodoacetamide and 1 mM maleimide. The HTS compatibility of the TR­FRET-based DEN1 peptidase assay was then assessed in a ``pilot screen" by testing a randomized 1536-well compound plate chosen from the 2.5 million compound library of the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF, San Diego, CA, USA). In the final protocol, 2 ll of GST­

(1-mM dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] stocks) were pintool-transferred (V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA) from a 1536-well compound plate. Then 50 nl of iodoacetamide (10 mM stock in DMSO) was added from a second control compound plate into 7 reference wells on the same assay plate (position H45­N45). The assay plate was then preincubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by the addition of 2 ll of His6­Myc­proNEDD8­FLAG. At the end of a 6 h reaction time, 6 ll of detection reagent at final concentrations of 2 nM anti-Myc­Eu, 10 nM anti-FLAG­APC, and 1 mM maleimide in reconstitution buffer were added and incubated at room temperature for another 2 h before reading the TR­FRET signals on an Envision reader (PerkinElmer, Fremont, CA, USA). Fig. 2D shows the resulting data and assay statistic; the Z0 factor (Z0 = 1 À [(3rIodo + 3rDMSO)/(lIodo À lDMSO)]) [16] for this representative plate was 0.6. In conclusion, we have developed a robust and HTS-compatible TR­FRET assay for the peptidase activity of DEN1 in a miniaturized 1536-well plate format that is tailored to the screening of large diverse compound libraries. We believe that this assay will facilitate the discovery of DEN1 targeted small molecule inhibitors and valuable probes for the dissection of DEN1 and NEDD8 biology through the screening of targeted protease inhibitor collections and comprehensive diverse molecular libraries.
