these complex developmental processes. To gain some understanding of the molecular basis of fluke development, we reported recently the application of `differential display' to the identification of several previously undescribed cDNA sequences that are regulated in a stage-specific manner [5]. One sequence (DD2) identified an abundant 400­500 bp RNA species by Northern hybridization that was expressed at levels at least tenfold higher in immature parasites relative to adult parasites. This study reports the complete DD2 cDNA sequence which predicts a protein (termed FhSAP-1 ) encoding a novel member of the natural killer (NK)-lysin or saposin-like protein family of structurally related proteins [6­ 8] that is most related to the amoebapore polypeptides of pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica [9­15].

The DD2 sequence was isolated from an `adult' F. hepatica cDNA library [16] using the DD2 differential display clone as a probe and the complete nucleotide sequence is available in the GenBankTM database (accession number U58467). DD2 exhibits a continuous open reading frame (nucleotides 1­338) that is predicted to encode a 102 amino acid protein (termed FhSAP-1 ) extending from the putative methionine initiation codon (nucleotides 30 ­ 32) up to the first termination codon (nucleotides 336 ­ 338). A BLAST search [17] of the combined NCBI databases with the FhSAP-1 sequence revealed the highest similarity with the three E. histolytica ` amoebapore' --precursors (amoebapores A, B and C) [10,11,13]. The amoebapores are a family of related polypeptides (35 ­ 57% amino acid identity) that form ion-channels within target cell membranes and are believed to play a role in the extraordinary lytic capacity of this highly invasive protozoan parasite [9 ­ 15]. A CLUSTAL W (1.5) alignment [18] of the predicted FhSAP-1 protein sequence with each of the three amoebapore precursor proteins reveals 26 ­ 28% identity and 44 ­ 48% similarity (Fig. 1). Moreover, each of the cysteine residues within the predicted FhSAP-1 protein sequence aligns with the six conserved cysteines present within the mature coding regions of the amoebapore proteins (Fig. 1), strongly suggesting a common structural organisation between these proteins. The putative FhSAP-1 protein encoded by DD2 exhibits a typical hydrophobic signal peptide sequence [19,20]. The cleavage site for this putative signal peptide, as determined by the Signalp (V1.0) network server (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis; Lyngby, Denmark), is predicted to occur between amino acid residues 21 ­ 22 (Fig. 1, arrow), consistent with both the alignment data (Fig. 1) and hydropathy analysis [21] (data not shown). The mature protein is predicted to consist of 81 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 9094 Da. This prediction has yet to be confirmed through N-terminal sequence analysis of purified FhSAP-1. BLASTP similarity searches [17] of the NCBI protein sequence databases were performed using a substitution matrix (PAM 250) that is suitable

for highly divergent proteins [22]. In addition to the amoebapores, several functionally diverse proteins that include bovine saposin C [23], human saposin B [24], human and rodent pulmonary surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B) [25,26], rodent sulfated glycoprotein 1 (SGP-1) [27], porcine NK-lysin [28] and human granulysin [29,30] were also identified as sharing significant sequence similarity with FhSAP-1 (Fig. 1). Each of these proteins has recently been assigned to the NK-lysin or saposin-like protein family of structurally related proteins [6­8] that also includes saposins A and D [24,31], the small subunit of human acyloxyacylhydrolase [32] and acid sphingomyelinase [33]. Although the functions of the proteins within this family differ widely, ranging from the organisation of lipids within pulmonary surfactant by SP-B [34] to the antimicrobial and antitumour activity of NK-lysin [28], each molecule has shown the capacity to directly interact with phospholipids. Although the primary sequence identity for members of this protein family is variable (13­ 57% amino acid identity), the most striking common feature of these proteins is the presence of six absolutely conserved cysteine residues arranged within four amphipathic a-helical domains. The one exception is granulysin in which the first of the six cysteines appears to be displaced upstream (Fig. 1). From a CLUSTAL W (1.5) alignment [18] of the predicted 81 amino acid FhSAP-1 protein with the coding regions of amoebapores A, B and C [10,11,13], porcine NK-lysin [28], bovine saposin C [23], human saposin B [24,31], rabbit SP-B protein [35], mouse SGP-1 [27] and human granulysin [29,30] it can be seen that FhSAP-1 also belongs within this class of evolutionary diverse proteins (Fig. 1). Since conserved cysteine patterns are considered important in reflecting structural homology, this result suggests that the three-dimensional arrangement of disulfide bonds within FhSAP-1 may reflect that previously described for each of the related NK-lysin family proteins [6­8]. Recombinant FhSAP-1 was expressed by ligating the 427bp EcoRI insert contained within DD2 (comprising the entire FhSAP-1 coding region) `in-frame' with the Escherichia coli expression vec-

tor pGEX-2T [36]. Sera obtained from sheep 18weeks after infection with F. hepatica react strongly toward the 39 kDa GST-FhSAP-1 fusion protein but not with recombinant SjGST [36] alone (data not shown), demonstrating that antibodies directed against FhSAP-1 are produced in infected sheep. Using the GST-FhSAP-1 fusion protein, antibodies to FhSAP-1 were affinity purified from pooled serum obtained from sheep 8 ­ 20 weeks post-F. hepatica infection and depleted of non-specific antibodies by adsorption with SjGST. To investigate the expression of FhSAP-1 during development of F. hepatica, antiFhSAP-1 antibodies were used to probe Western immunoblots of detergent lysates obtained from newly excysted juvenile, immature and adult F. hepatica parasites. Although some non-specific reactivity of the secondary anti-sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugate antibody can be seen (Fig. 2A, and data not shown), a series of low molecu-

lar weight proteins specific to the anti-FhSAP-1 antibodies were identified within the lysates of immature F. hepatica parasites that were not detected within either the NEJ or adult lysates (Fig. 2A). At least 3­4 apparently distinct polypeptides ranging from 4­10 kDa were identified for both the reduced and non-reduced samples prepared from immature parasites. Importantly, the protein expression patterns are consistent with the data obtained from Northern blot analysis [5] indicating that expression of the FhSAP-1 transcript is down regulated as the parasite progresses toward maturity. The ability to detect several protein species within immature parasites with purified anti-FhSAP-1 immunoglobulins suggests that F. hepatica expresses a small family of FhSAP-1 -related proteins, as seen in E. histolytica [13]. By analogy with the amoebapores of E. histolytica [9­12,37], FhSAP-1 may be released from

Fig. 2. FhSAP-1 protein expression throughout F. hepatica development within the mammalian host. (A) Aliquots of detergent lysates prepared from immature (5 week), adult and NEJ F. hepatica containing equivalent amounts of protein were subject to non-reducing and reducing tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16% resolving gel) [42] and Western transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot reactions were carried out using affinity-purified sheep anti-FhSAP-1 antibodies as described in the text. The relative positions of the 14.4 and 6.5 kDa molecular weight markers are indicated. Note the non-specific reactivity of the secondary conjugate antibody resulting in the detection of several proteins ( \14 kDa) common to all three developmental stages for both non-reduced and reduced protein samples. The latter proteins were reproducibly identified on identical immunoblots probed with the secondary rabbit anti-sheep immunoglobulins (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) in the absence of primary anti-FhSAP-1 antibodies (data not shown). (B) Aliquots of immature, adult and NEJ F. hepatica ES containing equivalent amounts of protein were Western transferred and probed with anti-FhSAP-1 antibodies as in (A). Some non-specific reactivity of the secondary conjugate is again evident, resulting in the detection of a small number of larger proteins ( 22 kDa) common to all three developmental stages. Depletion of anti-FhSAP-1 antisera on an excess of purified recombinant GST-FhSAP-1 abolished any reactivity with parasite ES or detergent lysates (aside from the non-specific reactivity due to the secondary conjugate), confirming the specificity of the purified antibodies used in these studies (data not shown).

cytoplasmic storage granules present within F. hepatica parasites. To confirm this, excretory/ secretory (ES) material collected from in vitro maintained NEJ, immature and adult F. hepatica parasites was analysed for the presence of FhSAP-1 through Western immunoblotting. Two polypeptides consistent with the expected molecular weight of the FhSAP-1 protein, 6 and 8 kDa, were identified within ES obtained from both immature and adult F. hepatica (Fig. 2B). Neither molecule was detected within an equivalent amount of NEJ ES protein (Fig. 2B, and data not shown). The abundance of the 6 kDa protein appears to be roughly equivalent in both the adult and immature developmental stages, whilst the 8 kDa molecule is present in much larger amounts within immature ES than adult ES. Based on their relative mobility, neither molecule corresponds exactly to any of those identified within the detergent lysates prepared from immature parasites (data not shown). The finding that the anti-FhSAP-1 antibodies are reactive with proteins secreted by adult parasites is consistent with the fact that the FhSAP-1 cDNA clone was originally purified from an adult F. hepatica cDNA library. Given the similarities between the RNA [5] and protein expression profiles, the 8 kDa secreted protein may correspond to FhSAP-1. The 6 kDa protein that is secreted/excreted from both adult and immature parasites in approximately equal amounts may therefore represent another member of the FhSAP-1 family. Despite their structural similarities and shared ability to bind phospholipids, the activities of individual members of the NK-lysin family are quite diverse. Presumably, the conserved arrangement of disulfide-linked amphipathic helices provides a common structural framework that is able to support a wide array of biological functions and, as such, has been maintained throughout the course of evolution. The protein ­ lipid interactions lead to ion-channel formation and cell-lysis only for the amoebapores [10,11,13], NK-lysin [28,38] and granulysin [30]. NK-lysin and granulysin both possess broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities and are present within the cytotoxic granules of cytolytic T lymphocytes and NK cells of porcine and human origin, respectively. For

other proteins within the NK-lysin group, related protein­lipid interactions lead to the stimulation of glycosphingolipid catabolism (saposins A­D) [8,24], a reduction in the surface tension at air­ lipid interfaces within the lung (SP-B) [34], hydrolysis of sphingomyelin within lysosomes (acid sphingomyelinase) [33], modification of membrane lipids during sperm maturation (SGP-1) [27] and bacterial lipopolysaccharide detoxification in phagocytic cells (acyloxyacylhydrolase) [32]. Each of these specific functions is likely to be associated with non-conserved residues present in the a-helical bundles themselves or, alternatively, in the apparently unrelated regions connecting each helix. However, given that structure­function relationships attributable to either conserved or non-conserved sequence elements within the NK-lysin family remain to be elucidated, it is difficult at this stage to identify a likely role (s) for FhSAP-1 within developing F. hepatica. If FhSAP-1 possesses an amoebapore-like capacity to form ion channels within lipid bilayer membranes, FhSAP-1 may contribute to the lymphotoxic activities previously attributed to F. hepatica ES that are proposed to mediate (at least in part) parasite evasion of the host's cellular immune response [39,40]. However, given the inadequacies of de novo fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis within trematodes [41], FhSAP-1 may function in a manner that is related to other members of the NK-lysin family and play a role in various aspects of fluke lipid metabolism.
