ABSTRACT The Escherichia coli open reading frame YbdK encodes a member of a large bacterial protein family of unknown biological function. The sequences within this family are remotely related to the sequence of -glutamate-cysteine ligase ( -GCS), an enzyme in the glutathione biosynthetic pathway. A gene encoding -GCS in E. coli is already known. The 2.15 Å resolution crystal structure of YbdK reveals an overall fold similar to that of glutamine synthetase (GS), a nitrogen metabolism enzyme that ligates glutamate and ammonia to yield glutamine. GS and -GCS perform related chemical reactions and require ATP and Mg2 for their activity. The Mg2 -dependent binding of ATP to YbdK was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy employing 2 (or 3 )-O-(trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5 -triphosphate, and yielding a dissociation constant of 3 0.5 M. The structure of YbdK contains a crevice that corresponds to the binding sites of ATP, Mg2 and glutamate in GS. Many of the GS residues that coordinate the metal ions and interact with glutamic acid and the phosphoryl and ribosyl groups of ATP are also present in YbdK. GS amino acids that have been associated with ammonia binding have no obvious counterparts in YbdK, consistent with a substrate specificity that is different from that of GS. Ligase activity between glutamic acid and each of the twenty amino acid residues was tested on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by following the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. Catalysis was observed only with cysteine. A pyruvate kinase/ lactic acid dehydrogenase coupled assay was used to rule out GS activity and to determine that YbdK exhibits -GCS activity. The catalytic rate was found to be approximately 500-fold slower than that reported for authentic -GCS. Proteins 2004; 56:376 ­383. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

members. YbdK shows remote sequence homology to -glutamate-cysteine ligase ( -GCS, EC 6.3.2.2); enzymes from plants and some bacteria are more closely related to YbdK than those from animals. The closest homologue with experimentally confirmed -GCS function is one from Brassica juncea (PSI-BLAST E-score 3E-8, and 20% identity over 159 amino acid residues), which has been associated with the biosynthesis of heavy metal sequestering peptides.2 A second sequence homologue with confirmed function is the Arabidopsis thaliana -GCS involved in cadmium sequestration.3 The majority of carbon-nitrogen bond forming ligases (EC 6.3.) are involved in small molecule synthesis in reactions that typically utilize ATP, and in a few cases (EC 6.3.2.5 and EC 6.3.4.4) CTP or GTP. They have been grouped into five classes. The acid-ammonia or acid-amide ligase class (EC 6.3.1) includes glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6.3.1.2), and the acid-amino-acid ligase class (EC 6.3.2) includes -GCS. Both enzymes link glutamic acid to a nitrogen-containing moiety. In the nitrogen metabolism pathway, GS ligates ammonia to the -carboxyl of L-glutamic acid while hydrolyzing ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate. ATP transfers its phosphoryl group to the glutamic acid to form a -glutamyl phosphate intermediate, which reacts with ammonia to form glutamine and phosphate.4 ­ 6 GS also functions in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, where it is involved in the conversion of Und-PP-MurNAc-(GlcNAc)-L-Ala-D-Glumeso-1,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-Ala-D-Ala to Und-PP-MurNAc-(GlcNAc)-L-Ala-D-Gln-meso-1,6-diaminopimeloyl-DAla-D-Ala. This makes GS an important component of antibiotic resistance.7 Two different proteins are annotated in E.coli as glutamine synthases. The protein b3870/ P06711 (glnA) is part of an operon (glnG-glnL-glnA) associated with nitrogen metabolism, whereas b1297/

P78061 is annotated as a putative glutamine synthase. The sequence identity between the two proteins is 25% over 397 residues, and the BLAST E-score is E-16. GS has been extensively studied.8 Structures of GS in the unbound state and in complexes with substrates and inhibitors have been published.9 ­11 The structure containing an ADP molecule, two Mn(II) ions, and the glutamatemimicking inhibitor, phosphinothricin, revealed the environment and mode of binding of these moieties11 (PDB entry code 1FPY), and comparison with the structure lacking the inhibitor indicates that the enzyme undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding.11 -GCS catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of glutathione, forming a peptide bond between a CO group of the -carboxyl of L-glutamate and an -amino group of L-cysteine.12 As with GS, the ATP-dependent reaction requires Mg2 or Mn2 . The structure of the enzyme has not been determined yet; however, sequence analysis has revealed common motifs in -GCS and GS despite the remote overall sequence similarity between the two. The fingerprint for the binding of the two metal ions seen in GS also exists in -GCS. A three-dimensional model of -GCS from Trypanosoma brucei was built based on this analysis.13 We report the crystal structure of YbdK, which reveals the same fold as GS. We also show that the protein exhibits Mg2 -dependent ATP binding and that it uses the conversion of ATP to ADP to catalyze the -GCS reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and Expression of YbdK Specific PCR TOPO-charged oligonucleotides were designed to amplify YbdK from genomic E.coli K-12 DNA using Pfu polymerase under standard conditions. The amplified YbdK gene was cloned into the pET Directional TOPO expression system (Invitrogen). E.coli BL21Star(DE3) cells were used as the hosts for protein expression. Cells were transformed with the recombinant ampicillin-resistant plasmid and grown for 14 ­16 h at 37°C. This culture was diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in fresh luria broth containing 100 g/mL ampicillin and 1% glucose. Cells were then grown at 37°C for approximately 3 h, induced at mid-log phase with 1 mM isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and harvested after 3 h of induction. The pellet was frozen at 20°C. For selenomethionine-containing (SeMet) protein production, E. coli strain B834(DE3) was transformed with recombinant plasmid harboring the YbdK gene. Cells were grown in M9 media supplied with the 19 other amino acids, 50 g/mL SeMet and 100 g/mL ampicillin. Protein Purification The purification procedure for both wild-type and SeMet YbdK was the same. Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen), benzonase and lysozyme. The cells were then broken by passage through a French press. After lysis, cells were clarified by high-speed centrifugation. The

supernatant was applied first to Q sepharose HP column in loading buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1-1.0M NaCl over 12 column volumes. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated and applied to a Sephacryl S200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl. The fractions containing YbdK were pooled and concentrated. Saturated ammonium sulfate was added to the protein solution to a final concentration of 1M and the protein was transferred to a phenyl sepharose HP column in loading buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1M ammonium sulfate, 0.25 mM PMSF, and 1 mM EDTA. The adsorbed protein was eluted with a 1.0-0.0M ammonium sulfate gradient in ten column volumes and was found to be more than 99% pure, as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The buffer solution was exchanged for 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 100 mM NaCl, and the protein sample was transferred to a Mono Q column and eluted using a linear gradient of 100 ­ 400 mM NaCl in 30 column volumes. Protein solution was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and concentrated to achieve a final protein concentration of 12 mg/mL for wild-type YbdK, and 14.7 mg/mL for the SeMet YbdK. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) To determine the oligomeric state of the protein, DLS measurements were performed using a Dyna Pro instrument (Protein Solutions). The YbdK protein solution was diluted to a final concentration of 3 mg/mL and centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min at a speed of 14,000 rpm. The sample was then passed through a 0.02 m filter. The DLS measurement showed one single peak (98% in bimodal analysis) with a mean Rh value of 3.7 nm. This corresponds to a standard-curve molecular weight of approximately 72 kDa. The SeMet YbdK sample also showed one major peak with a mean Rh value of 3.8 nm, similar to the value obtained with wild-type protein. The theoretical molecular weight of YbdK is 41,688 Da. Thus, the molecular weight indicated by the analysis is somewhat lower than the value expected for a dimer. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography Size exclusion chromatography using Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed to further asses the molecular weight of the protein in solution. The experiment was carried out at a low flow rate (0.3 mL/min) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. A calibration curve was prepared by measuring the elution volume parameter, Kav, obtained from two different sets of low molecular weight calibration standards (Bio-Rad and Amersham Biosciences). The estimated molecular weight of the protein was 63.5 kDa, even lower than that obtained by the DLS experiment.

All spectra were obtained using a Spex FluoroMax2 at 293 K. Two milliliters or 150 L of solutions containing 1 M 2 (or 3 )-O-(trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5 -triphosphate (TNP-ATP), trisodium salt (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and 10 mM MgCl2 were titrated with 1 L aliquots of YbdK. The samples were excited at 408 nm, and emission spectra were recorded at 480 ­ 620 nm. Maximal fluorescence was observed at 536 nm. Enzyme Assays The conversion of ATP to ADP was assayed discontinuously by quenching on dry ice and separating the products on a 10 100 mm Poros QE 20 column (Applied Biosystems, USA) using a mobile phase of 10 mM­1M ammonium acetate, pH 6.0. Reaction mixtures contained 500 M ATP, 10 mM L-glutamate, 10 mM of a tested substrate (except for -aminobutyric acid (ABA) at a concentration of 100 mM), 1 mM MgCl2 in 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. Reactions lacking the second substrate and the enzyme were used as controls. All 20 common amino acids were tested, and the mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The ATPase activity was followed at 37°C using a spectrophotometric assay that couples ADP production with the oxidation of NADH via pyruvate kinase and lactic acid dehydrogenase to regenerate ATP.13 The reaction mixture contained Tris-HCl (100 mM, pH 7.8), potassium L-glutamate (10 mM), a second substrate as listed below, MgCl2 (20 mM), disodium ATP (5 mM), monosodium phosphoenol pyruvate (2 mM), NaCl (100 mM), NADH disodium salt (0.15 mM), pyruvate kinase type III from rabbit muscle (20 units/mL), and lactic acid dehydrogenase type II from rabbit muscle (20 units/mL). The reaction was initiated by the addition of YbdK, and the rate of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed at 37°C using a Cary 300 Bio UV/Visible spectrophotometer. The following substrates were tested: ABA (100 mM), cysteine (10 mM), DL-homocysteine (20 mM), aspartic acid (10 mM), and serine (10 mM). The rate of ATP hydrolysis (kcat) was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of NADH (6220 M 1cm 1). Crystallization and Data Collection Crystals of SeMet-containing YbdK were obtained by the vapor diffusion method in hanging drops at room temperature. The reservoir solutions contained 0.2M NaCl and 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350. The hanging drops contained equal volumes of protein solution (14.7 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5), and reservoir solution. For data collection, crystals were briefly soaked in a mother liquid solution containing an additional 25% glycerol, and flash-cooled with liquid propane cooled by liquid nitrogen. The crystals belong to space group P21, with unit cell dimensions a 49.5 Å, b 100.3 Å, c 71.3 Å, and 99.9° (Table I). The solvent comprises 40% of the crystal, and the asymmetric unit contains two protein molecules (forming a dimer).

was used to determine the positions of Se atoms, using data to a resolution limit of 2.5 Å. Nineteen of the potential sites were identified, two of which were later found to represent alternative conformations of the same SeMet residue. No Se site was found for Met1, Met36, or Met216 of one molecule, or for Met1 of the second molecule in the asymmetric unit. These residues are disordered or associated with high crystallographic temperature factors in the refined structure. Phase determination was carried out at a 2.15 Å resolution using SOLVE. The phases were further improved by solvent-flattening and two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging using the program RESOLVE.16 Automatic tracing by RESOLVE built a polyalanine model for 521 out of 744 residues.17 The remaining polypeptide chain of one molecule was built manually on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation using the interactive computer graphics programs Xfit.18 After adding the side chains, the second molecule of the asymmetric unit was generated by applying the non-crystallographic symmetry operators. Refinement of the structure (Table II) was carried out using the program CNS,19 with data between 20 Å and 2.15 Å. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit were refined independently. Following a simulated annealing molecular dynamics cycle at 4000 K, alternating cycles of positional and individual temperature factor refinement were performed. The resulting model was inspected and

modified using Xfit. In the final stages of the refinement, water molecules were added using SHELXWAT20 based on the Fo Fc difference electron density map (where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively), using peaks with density 3 as the acceptance criteria. Structure analysis was carried out using a number of computer programs, including PROCHECK21 for geometric analysis, MOLSCRIPT22 and RASTER3D23 for structure depiction and DALI24 for identification of structural homologues. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Final Model The crystallographic R-factor of the SeMet-containing YbdK was found to be 0.189, and Rfree was 0.252 (Table II). The electron density map in the vicinity of the active site is shown in Figure 1. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, A and B, forming a homodimer, consistent with the DLS result (and, more ambiguously, with the size exclusion chromatography). The model also contains 658 water molecules. No electron density is associated with several amino acid residues, and accordingly these residues were omitted from the model. The missing residues in molecule A include the N-terminal residues 1 and 2, residues 106 ­121, and the C-terminal residue, 372. The disordered residues in molecule B are 1, 53, 106 ­117, and

STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF YbdK

Overall Structure YbdK assembles into a dimer of asymmetric dimensions approximately 80 Å 50 Å 40 Å. The dimer contacts include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and a solvent-filled cavity. The total subunit area buried in the dimer interface is 1784 Å2, approximately 11% of the total surface area. Because of the presence of the cavity, and the ambiguity in the DLS and the size exclusion chromatography analysis, the oligomeric state of the biological unit remains unclear. The molecule adopts an fold (Figures 2, 3a, and 4). A core antiparallel -sheet of six strands is curved into a half barrel with the topology 22- 31- 12- 41- 62- 5, as shown in the orientation of Figure 3a. Thirteen helices wrap around the convex side of the -sheet in two layers, with two hydrophobic helices ( 6 and 8 in Fig. 4) that are buried between the central -sheet and a second layer of helices. Two -hairpin units are present, one connecting helices 4 and 5, and the second connecting helices 8 and 9. The concave face of the -sheet is mostly solvent exposed and contains the proposed active site crevice. Structural Relationship to Glutamine Synthetase A structural similarity search using the program DALI24 revealed a relationship between the structures of YbdK and GS [Figs. 3(a,b) and 4]. The DALI Z-score to the PDB coordinate set 1LGR25 is 13.9 and the RMS deviation of C atom positions (spanning 238 of the 350 ordered residues of YbdK that align with the catalytic domain of GS) is 3.5 Å. In general, the core secondary structure units are similar, but some loop regions are quite different. The second structure homologue is creatine kinase26 (PDB entry code 1QH4), with a Z-score of 5.6 and an RMS deviation for C atom positions of 3.6 Å for only 140 aligned residues. In SCOP,27 this fold is classified as the superfamily of glutamine synthetase/guanido kinase, which in addition to GS and creatine kinase also includes arginine kinase. The default DALI search did not identify the arginine kinase as

a structural homologue, but a pairwise DALI alignment of YbdK with arginine kinase28 (PDB entry code 1M15) yielded a Z-score of 4.7 and an RMS deviation for C atom positions of 3.6 Å for 137 aligned residues. YbdK lacks the N-terminal domain of GS, a domain that carries Asp50 and Ser53, which has been proposed to be involved in ammonia binding.11 Also, the two proteins form different quaternary structures. GS assembles into a hexamer of dimers, such that Asp50 on the N-terminal domain projects into the active site of a neighboring molecule. YbdK associates into dimers, with a different interface than that seen in GS. Moreover, each YbdK active site is formed by only one molecule. Two loop regions that may be relevant to enzymatic activity are worth noting. The YbdK loop that spans residues 100 ­131, including the 106 ­121 disordered segment, is absent in GS. In turn, a GS loop (residues 323­330) that closes on the glutamate analogue, phosphinothricin, adopts a more open conformation in the absence of the inhibitor. This loop corresponds to the 184 ­192 loop of YbdK, which in the current structure adopts an open conformation, although somewhat different than that of the GS loop. The possible role of the 100 ­131 loop of YbdK in activity is discussed below, whereas the involvement of the 184 ­192 loop in activity is not obvious based on structural considerations alone. The active site crevice in both GS and YbdK is approximately 25 Å long. Many of the active site residues of GS are conserved in YbdK (Fig. 4), which further substantiates the location of the YbdK active site. The common features are shown in Figure 3©, and are discussed below. In the GS PDB entry code 1FPY, the adenine stacks itself between the side chains of Arg355 and Phe225. In addition, it forms polar and hydrophobic interactions with other amino acid residues.11 In particular, Ser273 hydroxyl interacts with the N-6 atom of the adenine. The ribose moiety forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of His271 and the main chain nitrogen atom of Phe225. Two Mn2 ions bind in the active site. One Mn2 coordinates the -phosphoryl group of ADP, the carboxyl groups of Glu129, Glu357, and the N atom of His269. The second Mn2 coordinates the carboxyl groups of Glu131, Glu212, and Glu220, and the phosphino group of phosphinothricin, the homologue of glutamate. A dip at one end of the active site crevice anchors the backbone of the glutamate, such that the amino group interacts with the side chain of Glu131 and the carbonyl group of Gly265. The carboxylate group of the substrate/inhibitor interacts with the side chains of His269 and Arg321. Finally, Arg359 is close to the phosphino group of the inhibitor, and is likely to counter the charge on the side chain carboxylate group of a glutamate substrate. The superposition of the active site residues of GS and YbdK shows that the YbdK residues flanking the adenine are different from those of GS. Val65 and Phe 233 of YbdK are the likely counterparts of Phe225 and Arg355 of GS, respectively. The YbdK residue equivalent to the GS Ser273 is a glycine. However, another conserved serine, Ser9, is located nearby, and modeling shows that a small

382

adjustment to the ATP molecule enables an analogous N-6-hydroxyl interaction. The inferred interactions between the ATP ribose and YbdK are equivalent to those seen in GS, one with the main chain amide nitrogen of Val65, and the second with His138 [Fig. 3(c)]. The Mg2 /Mn2 that coordinates the -phsophoryl group of ADP also coordinates the side chains of Glu17 (Glu129 in GS), Glu237 (Glu357 in GS) and His136 (His269 in GS). Similarly, the fingerprint for binding the second Mg2 /Mn2 is present in YbdK. Glu19, Asp53, and Glu90 are the counterparts of Glu131, Glu212 and Glu220 in GS. Of these, Asp53 is oriented away from the Mg2 /Mn2 site, but this may be because of the absence of metal in the crystals. The dip that anchors glutamate is present also in YbdK. Glu19 (Glu131 in GS) and the main chain carbonyl of Val132 (Gly265 in GS) are in position to interact with the amino group of glutamate. His136 (His269 in GS) and Arg182 (Arg321 in GS) counter the main chain carboxylate charge of the glutamate substrate. Arg239 (Arg359 in GS) is the likely residue to interact with the -carboxyl group of a glutamate substrate. While the common active site features suggest that both YbdK and GS utilize magnesium, ATP, and glutamate in a similar manner, there are substantial differences close to the implied site of glutamate-ammonia ligation in GS. In GS, Asp50 on the N-terminal domain of a neighboring molecule, and Glu327 on the adjustable loop cover the active site, and thus both were implicated in activity. These residues are missing in YbdK. On the other hand, the YbdK 102­128 loop, a loop that is absent in GS, exhibits substantial disorder, and is located close to the glutamate site. It is tempting to speculate that upon substrate binding, the loop adopts a conformation that sequesters the active site from solvent. An aromatic residue on this loop, Tyr116 (sometimes replaced by a phenylalanine) may provide a key interaction with the substrate. The above differences occur in the vicinity of both the glutamate and ammonia/amine binding sites. However, as the residues involved in glutamate binding are conserved in GS and YbdK, glutamate must be a common substrate of both enzymes. Thus, the differences described above pertain to the second substrate, and ammonia is an unlikely substrate of YbdK. YbdK Sequence Family and Relationship to GCS The sequence identity between the E. coli YbdK and its close family members varies between 23­ 84%. The pattern of residue conservation (Fig. 4) corresponds to clusters of key active site residues, and to residues located behind the dip that anchors the glutamate substrate (the 159 ­169 and 285­291 segments). The second iteration cycle of PSI-BLAST reveals homology to -GCS. The residues that coordinate two metal ions are present in -GCS: (a) Glu55, Glu93, and Glu100 may coordinate the L-Glu metal, and (b) Glu53, Glu489, and Gln321 may coordinate the ATP metal (the numbering scheme follows -GCS from Trypanosoma brucei). This homology was noted earlier by Grishin and colleagues in

an elegant analysis that identified sequence relationship between GS and -GCS corresponding to the active site residues, and proposed a three dimensional structure based on the structure of GS.13 The structural similarity between YbdK and GS further substantiates the prediction that -GCS adopts the GS fold. Nucleotide Binding The fluorescent nucleotide TNP-ATP was employed to investigate nucleotide binding to YbdK. Samples were incubated for 5 minutes prior to the measurements. The data were analyzed by non-linear regression, and fitted to a simple hyperbolic model. The calculation yields Kd 3 0.5 M. After the fluorescence reached a plateau, 1 L aliquots of 100 mM ATP or GTP were added. For the addition of ATP, the fluorescence decreased, reaching 50% of the maximum value at a concentration of 27 M added ATP. For the GTP experiment, no change in fluorescence was detected. These experiments confirm that the enzyme is an ATP-dependent ligase, and not a guanido kinase. The addition of 50 L of 250 mM EDTA resulted in fluorescence decrease close to the fluorescence value of TNP-ATP alone, confirming that nucleotide binding is Mg2 -dependent. Enzyme Activity The ligase activity of YbdK was initially assayed directly by measuring conversion of ATP to ADP using anion exchange chromatography. Activity towards all 20 common amino acids and ABA were tested, and only Lcysteine produced detectable amounts of ADP. With the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay, activity was also observed towards ABA. In fact, the catalytic rate was slightly higher (kcat 0.007 s 1) com1 pared with L-cysteine (kcat 0.004 s ). This was previously reported for authentic -GCS, and attributed to cysteine undergoing spontaneous oxidation.29 The enzyme is also active towards homocysteine (kcat 0.002 s 1), but no significant ligase activity was detected with ammonia or with any of the other amino acids tested. YbdK catalytic rates are approximately 500-fold slower than those reported for authentic -GCS from T. brucei.13 Biological Function The structure and activity of YbdK confirm that the enzyme is a carboxylate-amine ligase. Because of the low catalytic rates, the question remains whether L-cysteine is the actual biological substrate. -GCS is known to act on other amino acids than L-cysteine, but with lower activity.29 By analogy, it is possible that we have not identified the true substrate of YbdK, and the low catalytic rate observed with L-cysteine corresponds to a non-specific activity. Clearly, the true substrate in this case would not be one of the common amino acid residues which have been already assayed in this study. Alternatively, it is possible that YbdK is a second -GCS in E. coli or in other bacteria whose genomes contain YbdK family members. This is not unprecedented; Streptomyces coelicolor contains two GS homologues, GS-I and GS-II.30

In that example GS-I is more active than GS-II. In fact, sequence analysis indicates that E. coli also contains two GSs. Finally, if YbdK is a -GCS, perhaps it requires a partner protein to exhibit the optimal activity, reminiscent of the mouse enzyme that functions with a modifier subunit.31 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank John Moult and Eugene Melamud for the use and help with their bioinformatics web site (http:// s2f.carb.nist.gov); James Parsons and Debra DunawayMariano for advice regarding the functional assays; the staff at the Advanced Photon Source, IMCA-CAT, for their help during data collection.
