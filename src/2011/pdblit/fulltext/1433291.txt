The sequence-specific `H nuclear mag netic resonance (n.m.r.) assignment of 49 of the 51 amino acid residues of human BS(Asp) insulin in water at, low pH is reported. Spin systems were identified using a series of two-dimensional n.m.r. techniques. For the majority of t'he amino acid residues with unique spin systems, parbicularly Ala, Thr, Val, Leu, Tie and Lys, the complete spin systems were identified. Sequence-specific assignments were obtained from sequential nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) connectivities. The results indicate that the solution structure of the mutant closely resembles the crystal structure of native insulin. Thus, the NOE data reveal three helical domains all consistent with the secondary structure of the native human 2Zn insulin in the crystal phase. Numerous slowly exchanging amide protons support these structural elements, and indicate a relatively stable structure of the protein. A corresponding resemblance of the tertiary structures in the two phases is also suggested by slowly exchanging amide protons, and by the extreme chemical shift values observed for the P-protons of Bl5(Leu) that agree with a close contact between this residue and the aromatic rings of B24(Phe) and B26(Tyr), as found in the crystal structure of the 2Zn insulin. Finally, there are clear indications that the BS(Asp) insulin mutant exists primarily as a dimer under the given conditions.

1. Introduction The physiological importance of insulin, as the only hormone that reduces the blood sugar concentration, has triggered numerous biophysical and biochemical studies of its structure and structurefunction relationship. Important landmarks in these studies are detailed determinations of the threedimensional crystal structure of different insulins by X-ray crystallography. Thus, the crystal structure of native 2Zn pig insulin was determined at an early stage (Adams et al., 1969; Blundell et al., 1971). More recently it was refined to 1.5 .& resolution (1 A=@1 nm; Baker et al., 1988). With the development of the n.m.r..$ method for three-dimensional structure determination of proteins in solut'ion (Wiithrich, 1986), insulin would

seem t,o be an obvious target' for such a determination. This holds. in particular, because the relatively low molecular weight of the hormone should make it' amenable to two-dimensional n.m.r. investigat'ions. Nevertheless, a detailed and complete 21) n.m .r. analysis of native insulin in water has not' been reported so far, the reason being the self-association of native insulin in solution (Blundell ef al.. 1972) t'hat occurs at' the concentrat,ion required for 21) n.m.r. studies. Thus, in a 1 mM aqueous solution at pH 2.0, 25°C. and an ionic strength of 0.1, the apparent. average molecular weight of insulin is well above the molecular weight of the monomer (Jeffrey 8r (loates 1966u,b; Blundell et al.. 1972), corresponding to an equilibrium mixt)ure of monomers, dimers, tetramers, hexamers: and higher-order oligomers. This, inevitably, leads to line-broadening due to the longer correlation times of the aggrrgates. In addition, exchange between t,he monomeric and the oligomeric states can lead to linebroadening for exchange rates in t,he 0.1 to 1 kHs range. As suggested (Weiss et al.. 1989) both processes contribute to the broadening of the prot,on n.m.r. signals of insulin at low pH values. The selfassociation can be reduced by the addition of an organic solvent, as demonstrated in an n.m.r. study of human insulin dissolved in a mixture, consisting of water and 35% (volume) deuterat.ed acetonitrile at pH 3.6 (Kline & Justice. 1990). Using this solvent, good-quality spectra were obt'ained. allowing a complete sequence-specific assignment' of t,he `H n.m.r. spectrum of the hormone. The chernical shift dispersion observed in the spectra was considered indicative of a globular nature of the protein. As shown by Boelens et al. (1990) the selfassociation of the shortened insulin derivative. des(B26-B27-B28-B29-B3O)-insulin (lIPI): is also sufficiently reduced at low pH (1.7 to 1.9) and low concentration (1 rnM) to allow a complete sequential assignment. However. the low concentration required constitutes a considerable challenge. Recently, a series of insulin mutants that are essentially monomeric at pharmaceutical concentrat,ions (0.6 mM) has been obtained by protein engineering (Brange et d., 1988). The main strat,egy followed was to int,roduce charge repulsion into the monomeric-monomeric interface by single amino
acid substitution. Most of these substitutions did

the native insulin under similar caonditions. Although the specific reason for t,his is unknown at the moment, it, undoubtedly reflects a reduced ten dency of aggregation. Still there are clear cbxperi mental indications (vide infm) that the B9(Asp) insulin mutant, as the native insulin, exists primarily as a dimer under the given experirnernal
condit~ions.

2. Materials and Methods (a) Sample preparation
Human BS(Asp) insulin was made by specific alteration
of the amino acid sequence at the Yt,h position in the H-chain from Ser t,o Asp through DN.4 t,echnology. After purification by reverse-phase h.p.l.~.. the purity of the insulin was at least 987;. The lyophilized powder was suspended in H,O (wit'h IO",, `H,O) or 9996Ob `H,O, and dissolved by adjusting the pH to 1.8 to l.!l. No further effort, was made to remove minor amounts ot HDO (1) is deuterium) from the samples dissolved in *H,O. The concentration of the samples was 5 mM or 7 mM with respect to the insulin mutant. No buffers were used. Dioxan was added only in the last experiments as an int'ernal reference to allow a precise determination of the chemical shift values. The samples were contained in high-quality n.m.r. tubes and were stored at 5°C bet,ween experiments. Under these conditions no deamidation or other types of degradation of the samples were observed, even after several weeks of storage. One sample, exposed t'o highly acidic pH, showed severe deamidation of the side-chain of the C-terminal asparagine in the A-chain, as revealed by several double signals in the n.m.r. spectra (de infra) . and verified by reverse-phase h.p.l.c*. purification. (b) n,.m,.r. exprimenhs The `H n.m.r. spectra were recorded at 500 MHz on a

BRUKER AM500 spectrometer equipped with an .4SPECT 3000 computer and a high sensitivity, dedicated
prot,on probe. The temperature of the probe was regulated by using an FTS Air-Jet Crystal Cooler. in order to keep t.emperaturr fluctuations at' a minimum (I ~0ldeg.C) during the experiments. All spectra were recorded with sequential quadrature detection in the t, dimension (Redfield & Kunz. 1975) and time proportional phase increments (TPPI) in the t, dimension (Drobny et al.. 1979; Bodenhausen et al., 1980; Marion & Wufhrich. 1983). allowing the transmitter to be placed in the centre of t,he spectral region, and the spectra to be represented in the phase-sensitive mode. In the t,ime domain each 27) spect,rum consisted of 2047 FID signals. each represented by 8192 data points. The sweep width was, in most cases. set to 20,000 Hz in both dimensions in order t)o minimize zoning artifacts that, ot'herwise. would give rise to baseline distortions (Abildgaard rt al., 1988; Marion & Bax, 1988). The %-dimensional methods applied inrlude COSY (Aue et al.. 1976), RELAY (Eich et al., 1982), DQS (Braunschweiler et al., 1983), TOCSY (Braunschweiler & Ernst, 1983; Bax & Davis, 1985) and NOESY (Jeener et al.. 1979; Macura et al., 1981). In the RELAY experiments the mixing time was set, t'o 26 ms allowing optimum coherence transfer from a-protons to y-protons aia p-protons in valine (Bax & Drobny, 1985). In the DQS experiment recorded in H,O. a mixing delay of 32 ms was used to achieve an optimum amount of double-quantum coherence between t,he a-protons of the glycine residues,

Here we present a 27) proton n.m.r. study of one of t'hese mutants. The study includes the sequential assignment of the major part of the amino acid
residues and the determination of the secondary structure. The mutant investigated is one in which

the serine residue in the ninth position of the B-chain of native human insulin has been substituted by an aspartic acid residue. Despite the fact that the study was carried out at a pH value well below the pKo value of the side-chain carboxyl group of the free aspartic acid, thereby jeopardizing the charge repulsion effect of the substitution, the proton n.m.r. spectrum of the mutant shows less

so as to optimize the intensity of the remote connectivities to the amide protons (Wagner & Zuiderweg, 1983: Ot,ting & Wiithrich, 1986). In the TOCSY experiment in H,O (with IO"/, `H,O) a mixing time of 35 ms was applied for the identification of the direct and the single relayed correlat,ions between backbone amide protons and the M and /?-protons, respectively. In `H,O solution a mixing time of 60 ms was used to achieve double and triple relayed correlations. In the TOCSY experiments a WALTZ-16 (Shaka et al., 1983) or a DTPSI-2 (Shaka et al.. 1988) spin lock pulse of 83 kHz was applied in combination with 2 z-filters (Sorensen et al.. 1984: Rance, 1985). The NOESY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 180 or 296 ms. Although random variation of the mixing time (Macura &. Ernst, 1980; Macura et al.. 1981, 1982) was not applied; there was no indication of any zeroquantum signals in the obtained NOESY spectra. In experiments where water saturation was needed, saturation was achieved by phase-coherent, continous irradistion during the preparation period (Hoult. 1976: Zuiderweg et al., 1986). A preparatiou period of 1.4 to 2.0 s was used in all experiments to obtain a sufficient amount of initial z-magnetization. In order to obtain correlations in the fingerprint region involving sr-protons normally saturated by the water irradiation, NOESY spectra in H,O were also acquired with a jumpreturn read pulse as described by Driscoll et al. (1989). In these spectra the residual water resonance was removed by deconvolution prior to the Fourier transformation (Marion & Bax, l989a) and a linear baseline correction was applied in both frequency dimensions. The spectra were recorded at the 2 temperatures. 295 K and 305 K in order to facilitate the assignment of near-degenerate signals. Especially during the sequential assignment procedure signals in regions with overlap were assigned by comparing the NOESY spectra obtained at 2 temperatures, Discrimination between slow and fast exchanging amide protons was achieved by recording a jump-return NOESY spectrum after dissolving the sample in 99.96~~&`H,O, and defining the amide protons still giving rise to cross peaks as slowly exchanging. The total acquisition times ranged between 15 and 50 h. The experimental data were transferred to a VAX 8350 computer and processed and represented using a homemade software package and the FTNMR program (Hare Research Inc.). The first data points in each slice were corrected by linear prediction estimation (Marion & Bax. 1989/j). In combination with the large sweep width, used in all cases except for the NOESY spectra obtained with a jump-return read pulse (&de supru), this made baseline correction unnecessary. After zero-filling and 2D Fourier transformation. the resolution was 488 Hz/point in the P, dimension and 244 Hz/point in the F, dimension, The general quality of the spectra is illustrated by the DQF-(:OSY spectrum in Fig. I. During the sequential assignment procedure the program HEQASSIGN (Billeter et at., 1988) was used fot intelligent book-keeping of the identified sequential and medium-range NOISY cross peaks.

(iii) Vnline, leucine and isoleucinr The four valine residues were identified by t,he observation of correlations bet'ween one P-proton and the protons of two methyl groups. All four assignments were verified in the RELAY spectrum by t,he appearance of signals correlating the m-proton and protons of the two y-methyl groups. Five of the six leucine residues were identified in the COSY, RELAY and TOCSY spectra, and later verified during the sequential assignment procedure. All resonances in Leu(A13), Leu(A16), Leu(B15) and Leu(Bl7) were assigned by the observation of a SH-CYCH correlation. two crCH+?CH correlations and two yCH-GCH, correlations for each leucine in t'he COSY or RELAY spectra. The protons of the methyl groups were connected to the backbone resonances by the observation of correlations between c( and &protons in the TOCSY spect,rum recorded in 2Hz0. It is of interest that the p-protons of Leu(B15) are shifted toward an unusually high field (-@02 p.p.m. and 0.73 p.p.m., respectively). This is most likely due to ring current effects caused by aromatic side-chains in the near proximity of the leucine residue. This is in close agreement with the crystal structure of the 2Zn insulin at neutral pH (Blundell et al., 1972) where Leu(B15) is positioned immediately above t'he rings of Phe(B24) and Phe(B26). It should be noted that neither for insulin in water/acetonitrile (Kline & Justice, 1990). nor fat DPI in water (Boelens et al.. 1990), were similar chemical shift values observed for extreme Leu(B15). For the fifth leucine, namely Leu(BB), no signals were observed correlating the cl-proton and the protons of the two &methyl groups in the TOCSY spectrum. However, weak relayed signals in the TOCSY spectrum correlating the P-protons with the S-protons served to identify the spin system. Subsequently, this was verified by the observation of intra-residual NOES between the c( and &prot'ons (Redfield & Dobson, 1988) and between t)he fl and S-protons. One of the two isoleucine residues, IIe(AlO), has been fully assigned. Early in the process of identifying the spin systems it was believed to be a valine or a leucine, as t,he down-field shift of the b-prot,ons relative to the y-methylene protons result's in an unusual appearance of the isoleucine spin system. A careful inspection of the COSY and RELAY spectra later established the current assignment of t*hr isoleucine. The second and last isoleucinr. Tle(A2). is not fully assigned. (iv) Lysine The only lysine residue of the hormone, K(B29), was completely assigned by combined use of the COW, RELAY and TOCSY spectra. Especially the TOCSY spectrum recorded in 2H20 proved very useful. as correlations were observed between the a-proton and all of the other non-labile protons in the spin system. As both of the two y-protons and the two &protons, respectively, are degenerate, the spin system observed in the TOCSY spectrum could

also be assigned to the arginine residue. This ambiguity, however. could be ruled out, by the absence of single relayed connertivities that would appear. had it been an arginine residue: i.e. a connectivity between the a and y-protons and brt,ween t.hth fl and S-protons of the arginine. The identification of tjhe Iysine was further confirmed in t,he sequt~nc~r-sy)rcific` assignment'. (v) ilrgin%nw fznd prolinr The arginine and the proline residue were identified in t,hc sequence-specific assignment. and by the observation of intra-residual NOE oonnectivities. For bot'h residues. aCH-PCH, correlations were located in regions with severe overlap and were; therefore: not' observed in the COSY spectrum. The observation of a COSY cross peak, connecting the labile c-proton with the &protons, confirmed the of the arginine. while t)he identificaidentification t,ion of the proline was confirmed by a TOCR'I signal correlating the a-proton with t,he &protons. The presence of a sequential NOE correlating the a-proton of Thr(B27) wit,h the &protons of Pro(B28). in combination with the absenc~t~of' a NOE correlating the two a-protons, indicate a tram conformation of t,he Thr(B27)-I%( B28) peptide bond (Wiit,hrich et al., 1984). This is in accordance wit'h the cryst'al st)ructure of the native human 2% insulin. (vi) Wutamic acid and glutamine The seven Glu/Gln spin systems wet-c all discriminated from the AMX spin systems by the observations of correlations bet ween t!he a-proton and three or four non-labile protons in the aliphatic region of the TOCSY spectrum. (vii) A M .Y *spin systems I)uring t,he identificat'ion process the AMX spin systems were not further categorized. Only the pr+ sence of t,he t'wo serine residues was suggested by the appearance of two AMX spin systems with low field (Gross & P-protons at relatively Kalbitzer, 1988). The chemical shift values for the identified spin systems are given in Table 1. The identification of t'he cross peaks in the fingerprint region of the DQF-COW spectrum is shown in Figure 2. (k)) Bequential assignmentCs Each of the amino acid residues Ala, Arg. Pro and Lys have unique spin systems, and occur only once in the sequence. Thereforr, they are key points in the sequent'ial assignment. However, only the alanine and lysine residues could be identified from the spin systems alone. Invest'igation of NOES involving the alanine residue resulted in the assignment of the tripeptide fragment GIu( B 13). Ala(B14)-Leu^(B15). Tnspection of the NOES involving the protons of the lysine spin system resulted in the identification of the proline residue. and in the assignment of the C-terminal threonine,

Solution Structure of insulin Thr( B30). The two remaining threonine residues were also identified at an early stage of the sequential assignment procedure. Thus, Thr(A8) has a sequential NOE to a serine, that is (A9), while Thr(B27) shows a NOE correlating its a-proton to the b-protons of Pro(B28). Further expansion of the peptide fragment involving Thr(A8) led to the assignment of Cys(A7) and Ile(A10). The second serine residue was identified as being a member of a tripeptide Ser- Leu-AMX, which was uniquely

assigned to the A-chain position 12, 13 and 14, respectively. Only one unique dipeptide fragment in addition to those present in the peptide fragments already assigned was found, namely Phe( B 1)-Val( B2). Subsequently, this was expanded to a tripeptide fragment including Asn(B3) by investigation of sequential NOE connectivities. At this stage of the assignment procedure it was necessary to search for longer peptide fragments to obt,ain further

(c) Secondary

structure

The identification of secondary structures in proteins by two-dimensional n.m.r. methods relies mainly on the observed sequential and mediumrange NOE connectivities, as reviewed by Wiithrich (1986). Regions dominated by helical structures are characterized by short sequential d,, and d,, distances, and several medium-range distances, including short d&i, i + 3)and d,,(i, i+ 3) distances, and slightly longer d&i, i + 2)- d&i, i + 4) and d,,( i, i + 2) distances. The various turns are also characterized by short dNN distances, whereas the /?-sheet structures are characterized by short sequential darN distances and long-range distances

connecting the peptide strands involved in the B-sheet formation. The identification of secondary structure in human BS(Asp) insulin is based on the 86 sequential and 19 medium-range NOE connectivities identified during the sequential assignment procedure. These connectivities are summarized in Figure 6. Three regions in the sequence have NOE connectivities that are characteristic of helical structures, namely the regions from Ile(A2) to Thr(A8) and from Leu(A13) to Cys(A20) in the A-chain, and the region from Asp(B9) to Cys(B19) in the B-chain. In all three cases the NH protons are characterized by slow exchange, as indicated in Figure 6. The three helical regions are consistent with the crystal structure of native human 2Zn insulin at neutral pH (Blundell et al., 1972). The helix from Ile(A2) to Thr(A8) is then least well-defined of the three helices as indicated by the relatively few amide protons exhibiting slow exchange. This is in accordance with the crystal structure where the helix is rather irregular. The second stretch of helix is well defined in terms of sequential d,, and d,, connectivities. Only

between Tyr(A14) and Gln(A15) is the observation of the corresponding sequential connectivity prevented by near-degeneracy of the NH resonances. The two daN(i, i + 3) correlations, connecting Leu(A13) to Leu(A16) and Leu(A16) to Tyr(A19) are also good indications of the helical structure. The large number of slowly exchanging amide protons further indicates a regular helical stwcturr stabilized by an equivalent number of hydrogen bonds. The third helical region, stretching from Asp(B9) to Cys(BlS), is less well defined in terms of sequential NOES, since Leu(B11) has not been assigned. Also the near-degeneracy of the NH resonances of Leu(B15) and Tyr(B16), and of Val(B18) and Cys(BlS), respectively, preclude the observation of connectivities. the important sequential d,, Consequently, the identification of this helix relies, primarily, on the observed medium-range connectivities, including one d&i, i + 2), four d&i, i + 3) and three d,,(i, i +4) connectjvities. The three d&i, i + 4) connectivities indicate an a-type helix

that is consistent with the crystal structure of the 2Zn insulin. The d,,(i, i + 2) correlation between Gly(B8) and His(B1O) suggests that the helix could be extended to include Gly(B8). The K-terminal end of the B-chain is well defined, between all neighwith strong dnN connect'ivities bouring residues from Phe(B1) to Asp(B9) where the central helix of the B-chain begins, as shown in Figure 5. No medium-range NOE connectivities have been observed in this region and it is, therefore, probable that no regular secondary structure exists. This would be in accordance with the 2Zn insulin crystal structure, where the eight N-terminal residues of the B-chain are folded across and run antiparallel to the central part of the A-chain (Blundell et al., 1972). The four sequential dNN connectivities in the region could, however, indicate a rather twisted path of the backbone, but there is no evidence of any helical structure as seen in the crystal structures of 4Zn insulin (Bentley et al., 1976) and 2Zn insulin containing phenol (Derewenda et al., 1989).

The l-letter codes for the sequence of the A and the B-chain. respectively, are given at the top. The observed connectivities are indicated by bars connecting the 2 involved residues. For Pro(B28) the connectivity to the &protons is shown. Filled and empty circles indicate backbone amides with slow and rapid exchange rates, respectively

The slowly exchanging amide prot(on of residue Leu(B6) is in agreement with the hydrogen bond between this proton and the carbonyl oxygen of residue Cys(A6) that characterizes the tertiary structure of insulin in the crystal phase (Baker et al., 1988), and indicates t,hat the fold of N-terminal residues of the n-chain is similar to that of the crystal structure. The hydrogen bond from the amide proton of Cys(Al1) to the carbonyl oxygen of Gln(B4) is also evident as slow exchange is observed for the amide proton of Cys(Al1). However, the reverse hydrogen bond between NH-Gln(B4) and CO-Cys(Al1 ) could not be verified. After the central helix in the &chain from Ser(B9) to Cys(BIS), the peptide chain makes a p-bend in the crystal structure, giving rise to hydrogen bonds bet)ween NH of Arg(B22) and CO of Cys(B19) and between NH of Gly(B23) and CO of Gly(B20) (Baker ut n,l., 1988). The slow exchange of

the amide protons of Arg(K22) and Gly(B23) observed here indicates t'hat this structural feature is preserved in solution. Slow exchange of the amide proton of Phe(B25) is consistent with a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr(A19) evident in the crystal structure, and is again a.n indication of a tert,iary solution structure similar t'o that in the crystal phase. In a sample partially deamidated at' t'he sidechain of Asn(A21) several doubled cross peaks were observed corresponding t'o both the Asn(A21) form and the Asp(A21) form. The residues giving rise to double signals include, primarily, Tyr(AlS), Cys(A2O), Asn(ASl), but also double signals from Tyr(B26) and Thr(B27) were observed in the spectrum of' the sample. This latter effect suggests that these two peptide fragments are spatially near to each other, in agreement with the crystal structure. The two slowly exchanging amide protons of

Phe(H24) and Tyr(K26) cannotf be related to intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the crystal struct,urr. However, t'he monomer-monomer interface in the crystal includes an inter-molecular antiparallel P-sheet from Phe(B24) to Tyr(R26). This /?-sheet is held together by four inter-molecular hydrogen bonds involving residues Phe(B24) and Tyr(K2li) nf bot.h molecules in the dimer. t,hereby explaining the observed slow exchange. Tt is therefore very likeiS that. the BS(Asp) insulin mutant exists as a, dimer under the given experimental conditions. Tndeed, this is expected since the applied pH (1.8 to 1.9) value is well below the ph', value of the side-chain of the free aspart,ic acid. thereby eliminating the charge repulsion effect causing thr formation of monomers at, neutral pH. If t,he R9(Asp) insulin mutant exists as a dirner in solution. the fact t>hat it gives qualitatively better spect'ra than native insulin under the same conditions can be explained by a reduced tendency to form higher aggregates. II\ number of residues known from t,hc crystal structure to take part in the monomer~monomer This interface show considerable line-broadening. includes Val(Bl2), Tyr(B16), Phe(B25) and Tyr(B26). This cannot be a result' of exchange between monomers and dimers as t,his would imply the breaking of t#hc hydrogen bonds forming the intermolecular P-sheet), thereby causing fast exchange of the amide prot,ons of Phe(B24) and Tyr(H26). An explanat,ion more consist,ent' with t,he observed slow exchange of Phe(B24) and Tyr(K26) amide protons is t'he existence of difierrnt. conformations resulting in conformational averaging of t.hr resonances in the region. In the study of native insulin dissolved in a mixt'ure of water and acetonitrile (Kline & ?Just)ice. 1990) a similar effect was observed. The number of slowly exchanging amide prot,ons in the RS(Asp)-insulin is significantly larger than that, observed for nat'ive insulin in waterlacetonitrile where only seven slowly exchanging amide protons were observed, corresponding to residues A1.5, A1 6 and K1.5 to H19. These residues correspond to t'he cetltral part of tjhe second helix in the ;1 -chain and a larger part of the central helix in t.he B-chain. (lompared to this we observe a t,otal of 27 slowly exchanging amide protons in the BS(Asp) mutant distributed over the t,hree helical regions and a number of other positions in the B-chain (Gdr supra). Also, in contrast, to t'he study of insulin in waterlacetonitrile a large number of these were st'ill seen in the one-dimensional spectrum after 1X hours of exposure to the deuterated solvent (not8 shown). It is t)herefore suggested that insulin is more stahilized in terms of hydrogen bonds in water at low pH (1.8 to 1.9) than under conditions where significant amountas of acetonitrile are present. Thus, acetonit)rile may function as a weak denaturant resulting in more flexibility. The stability of the molecule could also be influenced by the state of aggregation. However, the information presently available on insulin dissolved in water/acetonitrile does not indicate whether insulin exists mainly as a monomer, a

dirner or a higher state of aggregation caonditioris.

4. Conclusion It has been demonstrated that SD n.m.r. studies of the solution struct'ure of a complete and biologically active insulin molecule in water have become feasible by use of a mutant' with a single amino acid substitution. Thus, an almost complete assignment of the proton resonances of the BS(Asp) mutant of human insulin at pH I.8 to 1.9 has been obtained together with the identification of t,he major secondary struct,ures. The secondary structures identified are all in accordance with the crystal structure of the native human 2Zn insulin at neutral pH. These structures include the three helices from Ile(A2) to Thr(AX), from Leu(AI 3) to Cys(A20) and from Asp(B9) t'o Cys(B19). respectively. and the ,&bend. involving the peptidr fragment, from Gly(B20) to Uly(R23). On the ot)her hand, there are no indications of an extension of t,he B9-1319 a-helix to the region from B2 to H9, as observed in 4Zn insulin (Bentley rt nl., 1976; Chothia ef al.. 1983), and in 2Zn insulin stabilized by phenol (Derewenda rf al., 1989). Rather, t.hr X-terminal part of the B-chain forms an extended chain as in t,hr crystal structure of 2Zn insulin. The pattern of slowly exchanging amide protons suggest.s t'hat the tcrtlary structure of insulin in solution is also very similar t,o t,hat observed in the crystal phase. Indications of an inter-molecular antiparallel P-sheet between the monomers in analogy with the crystal structure, suggest t'hat the R9(Asp) insulin mutant exists as a dimer under t'hc applied experimental conditions. In conclusion the results presented here show a close similarity of the structure of insulin in solut'ion and in the crystal phase, and provide the basis fo1 further investigations of t~hc structure and function of insulin in solution by the n.m.r. approach. Assignment of additional long-range NOE: connectivities art' in progress and are expectfed to result in a three-dimensional solut,ion structure.
