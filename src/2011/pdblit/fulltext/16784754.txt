Nitric oxide reductase cytochrome P450nor catalyzes an unusual reaction, direct electron transfer from NAD(P)H to bound heme. Here, we succeeded in determining the crystal structure of P450nor in a complex with an NADH analogue, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, which provides conclusive evidence for the mechanism of the unprecedented electron transfer. Comparison of the structure with those of dinucleotide-free forms revealed a global conformational change accompanied by intriguing local movements caused by the binding of the pyridine nucleotide. Arg64 and Arg174 fix the pyrophosphate moiety upon the dinucleotide binding. Stereo-selective hydride transfer from NADH to NO-bound heme was suggested from the structure, the nicotinic acid ring being fixed near the heme by the conserved Thr residue in the I-helix and the upward-shifted propionate side-chain of the heme. A proton channel near the NADH channel is formed upon the dinucleotide binding, which should direct continuous transfer of the hydride and proton. A salt-bridge network (Glu71-Arg64-Asp88) was shown to be crucial for a high catalytic turnover.

Introduction
Nitric oxide reductase cytochrome P450nor catalyzes an abnormal electron transfer, direct electron transfer from NADH or NADPH (NAD(P)H) to bound heme. Direct electron transfer from NAD(P)H to a redox protein that contains only a one-electron redox center, such as cytochrome, ferredoxin, and other metalloproteins, is usually impossible. This is because NAD(P)H releases two electrons simultaneously, usually as a hydride ion (HK),1­5 and the one-electron redox center can never accept a hydride ion directly. Electron

transfer from NAD(P)H to a one-electron redox center requires the aid of other redox partner(s), such as a flavoprotein. Therefore, the electron transfer catalyzed by P450nor apparently contradicts the classical central dogma of biological electron transfer. P450nor, which is involved in fungal denitrification, catalyzes an unusual reaction as compared with other monooxygenase cytochrome P450s (P450). It functions as nitric oxide reductase to reduce NO to N2O (Reaction 1).6 P450nor can perform this reaction without the aid of other redox partners. 2NO C NADðPÞH C HC/ N2 O C NADðPÞC C H2 O (1)

208 binds the substrate NO to form a ferric enzyme­NO complex (Fe3C­NO) (Reaction 2). Fe3C­NO is then reduced by NAD(P)H to yield a specific intermediate (I) exhibiting a Soret absorption peak at 444 nm (Reaction 3), and finally I reacts with the second NO to form the product N2O (Reaction 4). Regarding these reactions, the mechanism by which the two electrons of NAD(P)H are transferred to the Fe3C­ NO complex (Reaction 3) and what the chemical entity of I is the subject of great interest. The overall reaction of P450nor can also be viewed as 2NO C 2eK C 2HC/ N2 O C H2 O in which two electrons and two protons are supplied to reduce NO to N2O. We assume the intermediate I to be the two-electron reduced product of the Fe3C­NO, formally the (Fe3C­ NO)2K state. We found that I can be formed upon reduction of the Fe3C­NO complex with sodium borohydride (a hydride donor) instead of NADH, and observed a kinetic isotope effect as to Iformation (Reaction 3) for the proR hydrogen of NADH.8 These results are highly indicative that two electrons of NAD(P)H are transferred as a hydride ion, which is equivalent to two electrons and one proton, to the Fe3C­NO complex to form I. On the other hand, we are not sure in which step (Reaction 3 or 4) the second proton is supplied for the enzymatic reaction. Therefore, the chemical entity of I depends on whether the reduction step is a single or double protonic reaction. In spite of its abnormal function, P450nor belongs to the P450 superfamily, CYP 55,9 and its tertiary structure resembles those of other P450s.10 Therefore, elucidation of the structure­function relationship of P450nor is also important from the viewpoint of the molecular evolution of the P450 superfamily.11,12 The crystal structure of P450nor has so far been determined for the Fe3C resting state,10 Fe2C­CO complex,10 and Fe3C­NO complex.13 Little noticeable difference was observed between these ligand-free and ligand-bound structures, except that a new hydrogen bond network is formed in the Fe3C­NO complex involving Ser286, Asp393, and a few water molecules, which is supposed to act as a proton delivery system for I formation. Unique features characteristic of P450nor are noticeable in the structure on the heme-distal side of the molecule. The B 0 -helix and F, G-loop, which form the entrance gate, are oriented upwards to form a big cavity in the heme-distal pocket. This cavity comprises a hydrophilic environment with many hydrophilic amino acid residues and water molecules, which is in contrast to the distal pocket of other P450s, which is usually hydrophobic. The positive charge cluster comprising many Arg and Lys residues has been shown to be crucial for the interaction with NAD(P)H.14 The P450nor isozymes isolated from several fungi6,15,16 can be divided into two types, depending on their specificity for electron donors, NADH and NADPH. One type, such as P450nor of

P450nor in Complex with an NADH Analogue

Fusarium oxysporum (used in this study), is specific to NADH, and the other type can utilize both or even prefers NADPH to NADH. We showed that two amino acid residues in (or neighboring) the B 0 helix (at the 73rd and 75th sites in the case of P450nor of F. oxysporum) play a crucial role in the electron donor specificity.17 Mutations to delete the side-chains of Ser residues at these sites (Ser75Gly or Ser73Gly/Ser75Gly) enormously improved the reactivity as compared to NADPH of P450nor of F. oxysporum. This suggests that the specificity with respect to NADPH is determined by whether the space around the B 0 -helix can accommodate the bulky 2 0 -phosphate moiety of NADPH. These characteristic features of P450nor are consistent with the electron transfer from electron donor (NAD(P)H) on the distal side, unlike for other monooxygenase P450s, which receive electrons on the proximal side.18,19 However, we could not obtain a crystal of the P450nor­NADH complex, which would have afforded conclusive evidence of the above. In this study, we succeeded in crystallizing a complex of P450nor with an NADH analogue, nicotinic acid pyridine dinucleotide (NAAD), and in determining its structure utilizing a double mutant (Ser73Gly/Ser75Gly; GG mutant) of P450nor of F. oxysporum, whose affinity for NAD(P)H and its analogues was remarkably improved. The complex structure was the first direct evidence of the dinucleotide binding of P450nor, and gave a 3-D view of the active site of this unique enzyme complexed with an NADH analogue.

Results
GG mutant and crystallography The affinity of P450nor for the electron donor NADH is not high.15 Accordingly, the Kd values of the wild-type enzyme for NADC, NADPC, and PAAD are distributed in the range of 4.0­10 mM (Table 1).17 The low affinity was not improved by the Ser75Gly single mutation. Possibly because of the low affinity, we have not succeeded in crystallizing the wild-type P450nor or SG mutant in a complex with either of these NADH analogues. Here, we found that the affinity for these cofactor analogues was greatly improved with the GG mutant, as shown in Table 1. Crystallization trials using the GG mutant in the presence of 20­40 mM PAAD frequently produced plate-shaped crystals (type A), which were afterwards found to be cofactor-free. Infrequently, however, we obtained pillar-shaped crystals (type B), which were found to comprise a complex with NAAD. Although nucleation of type B crystals was not observed reproducibly, we could obtain isomorphous crystals by means of the microseeding method with good reproducibility. Type A crystals belong to monoclinic space group P21, with unit cell dimensions of ° ° ° aZ54.5 A, bZ79.4 A, cZ56.2 A, and bZ118.28. Type

209 adenine ring, and oxygen atoms of the nicotinic acid ring. On the other hand, hydrophobic interactions occurred with the carbon atoms of the aromatic and sugar rings. The mutated residue, Gly75, is involved in this hydrophobic interaction. Another important hydrophobic residue, Ala289, is located near the nicotinic acid ring. The distance between Cb of Ala289 and the C4 atom of nicotinic acid is ° 3.5 A. Global conformational change on NAAD binding The three structures of P450nor, i.e. those of the wild-type enzyme in the ferric­NO state (WT-NO; PDB entry 1CL6), cofactor-free GG, and the NAAD complex, were superimposed by least-squares fitting of heme atoms, and two of the structures are shown in Figure 2(a). The atoms of the switched propionate side-chain (described later) are not included in the least-squares fit. The cofactor-free GG structure was almost identical with that of WT° NO, the rmsd of Ca being 0.45 A. On the other hand, the NAAD complex structure was significantly different. The root-mean-square deviations of the Ca atoms of the NAAD complex as to WT-NO and ° ° cofactor-free GG were 1.51 A and 1.43 A, respectively. The heme-distal pocket of P450nor closes on NAAD binding, which results from global deformation not hinge motion. The movement was maximal at the entrance of the heme-distal pocket. The Ca atoms of Gln78 at the middle of the B 0 helix and Ala181 at the C terminus of the F-helix moved ° ° by 4.0 A and 3.1 A, respectively. On the other hand, there was no significant movement in the vicinity of the heme on its proximal side, including the cysteine heme-ligand (Cys352) (Figure 2(b)). Mass movement of the charged amino acid cluster on the B 0 -helix side Superimposition of the NAAD complex and WTNO structures at the heme-distal pocket is shown in Figure 2(b). As expected,14 Arg64 and Arg174 play a crucial role in the fixing of the pyrophosphate moiety at the center of the dinucleotide molecule. The conformation around the pocket was rearranged significantly on NAAD binding. The Arg64 residue located in the loop between the b5 ° strand and the B 0 -helix moved about 3.5 A to interact directly with the phosphate moiety on the adenosine side. Interestingly, most of the charged residues in the pocket (Arg62, Arg64, Glu71, Asp88, Lys291, and Arg292) are clustered on the Arg64-side beneath the B 0 -helix, whereas Arg174 is the sole charged residue on the opposite side beneath the F, G-loop. In response to the biased location of the charged residues, many hydrophilic moieties of the bound NAAD, including the hydroxyl groups of both the two ribose rings and the phosphate moiety on the adenine side, face the Arg64 side. On NAAD binding, each member of the charged cluster approaches the hydrophilic side of the NAAD molecule by a fair distance, accompanying the

B crystals belong to orthorhombic space group ° P212121, with unit cell dimensions of aZ43.3 A, bZ ° ° 56.1 A, and cZ163.3 A. Both crystal types contain one P450nor monomer per asymmetric unit, and the crystal structures were determined in the ferricresting state, by means of molecular replacement using the wild-type P450nor structure (PDB entry 1EHE)20 as the search model. The type A crystal ° structure (cofactor-free GG) was refined at 2.0 A resolution with a crystallographic R-factor of 20.5%. ° The type B crystal structure was refined at 1.8 A resolution with a crystallographic R-factor of 20.6%. The Fo­Fc omit map of the pyridine nucleotide cofactor bound in the type B structure is shown in Figure 1(a). For the aldehyde group of PAAD, two electron density peaks corresponding to oxygen (or nitrogen) were observed (designated as A and B in Figure. 1(a)). There was the possibility that the aldehyde group takes on two alternative conformations, or that it is oxidized into a carboxyl group. Two oxygen atoms were included tentatively in the model, and the occupancies of the atoms at the A and B positions were refined to 0.8 and 1.0, respectively. Therefore, we concluded that 80% of the PAAD molecules were oxidized to yield NAAD during the crystallization period. Here, the type B crystal structure is designated as the NAAD complex. The NADH molecule, which has a nicotineamide ring, is very similar to NAAD in shape, and is probably bound to P450nor in a similar conformation. The electron density of NAAD was clear for the nicotinic acid ribose and pyrophosphate moieties, but somewhat ambiguous for the adenine ribose moiety (Figure 1(a)). The nicotinic acid ribose and adenine ribose moieties were in the anti-C3 0 -endo and syn-C2 0 -endo conformations, respectively. A drawing of NAAD recognition is presented in Figure 1(b). The NAAD molecule was recognized through the following four types of interaction: that of a number of water molecules in the hydrophilic pocket; hydrophobic interactions with several residues; two arginine residues (Arg64 and Arg174) interacting with the pyrophosphate moiety; and hydrogen bonds to the nicotinic acid ring (Gly240 and Thr243). The water molecules formed an extensive hydrogen-bonding network involving the hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety, oxygen atoms of phosphate groups, nitrogen atoms of the

212 global main-chain movement (Figure 2(b); Lys62 and Lys291 are not indicated). These charged amino acid residues (except Arg64) do not interact directly with NAAD, but form a hydrophilic environment around the nicotinic acid ribose moiety via a number of water molecules. The side-chain amino group of Lys62 recognizes indirectly the O2 0 atom of the nicotinic acid ribose moiety via a water molecule. Arg292 corresponds to the arginine residue conserved in P450 proteins, which has been shown to be essential for the binding of the heme.21 In all of the previously known cofactor-free P450nor structures, Arg292 was shown to interact with one of the propionate side-chains of the heme via two water molecules. However, in the NAAD complex structure, this residue interacted directly with the propionate side-chain (Figure 2(b)). It is intriguing that the propionate side-chain changed its conformation, positioning its tip above the heme plane in concert with the upward shift of Arg292. On the opposite side of NAAD, the F-helix moved about a half-pitch along the helix to close the entrance of the NADH-access channel. In contrast to the mass movement of the charged residues on the opposite side, the tip of the sidechain of Arg174 did not move to maintain its position for the interaction with the pyrophosphate moiety, although the main chain of its root moved considerably (Figure 2(b)). Thus, the global conformational change caused upon NAAD binding is centered on the guanidino group of Arg174, which should first fix the NAAD molecule when it is engulfed in the pocket. The results are consistent with our previous observation that Arg174 is the most important residue for cofactor-binding.14 The salt-bridge network Glu71-Arg64-Asp88 Two negatively charged residues, Glu71 and Asp88, are present in the positive charge cluster of the heme-distal pocket (Figure 2(b)). They are located in the vicinity of Arg64, with the sidechain of Arg64 between them, acting like guards. In the dinucleotide-free structure, Glu71 and Asp88 are so close to Arg64 as to make a salt-bridge network. The interaction distances are as follows: ° Arg64 Nh1-Glu71 O32, 3.2 A; Arg64 Nh1-Glu71O31, ° ° ; and Arg64 Nh2-Asp88 Od2, 3.0 A. On NAAD 3.4 A binding, Glu71 accompanied Arg64 in response to the mass movement, while the movement of Asp88 was smaller, resulting in break of the salt-bridge between Arg64 and Asp88. The interaction distances in the NAAD complex form are as follows: ° Arg64 Nh1-Glu71 O32, 3.0 A; Arg64 N3-Glu71 O31, ° ° ; and Arg64 Nh2-Asp88 Od2, 5.4 A. 2.7 A Electron donor specificity for NADH and NADPH Previous studies have demonstrated that the 75th site in the B 0 -helix and the 73rd one in the next site are most crucial for the electron donor cofactor specificity of P450nor, as noted above. Actually, this region (Gly73-Gly75) was at a proximal position

with respect to the O2 0 atom of the adenosine ribose moiety in the NAAD complex structure of the GG mutant (Figure 3). The main-chain carbonyl carbon and amide nitrogen atoms of the peptide bond between Gly75 and Gly76 were located at distances ° ° of 3.5 A and 3.4 A, respectively, from the O2 0 atom of the adenosine ribose moiety. This agrees with the great decrease in NADH-dependent nitric-oxide reductase activity with the Gly76Ala mutation.17 Gly73 was located relatively far from NAAD. However, the GG mutant exhibits Kd values that are more reduced for NADC, NADPC, and PAAD (Table 1), as well as more improved NADPHdependent nitric-oxide reductase activity, compared with the SG mutant.17 The Ser73Gly and Ser75Gly mutations together could increase the flexibility of the main chain of this region, making it possible to accommodate a bulky group such as the 2 0 -phosphate group of NADPH in this region or to bind cofactor analogues more strongly. Active site The NAAD complex and WT-NO structures, superimposed at the heme active site, are shown in Figure 2(c). The distance between the heme iron atom and the C4 atom of the nicotinic acid ring is ° 4.2 A, and the superimposed NO molecule is located between them. The C4 atom of the nicotinic acid ring is located proximal to the oxygen atom of the NO molecule, facing the pro-R side at a distance ° of 1.8 A. There is no space to accommodate a water molecule between them. The carboxyl group at the C3 atom of the nicotinic acid ring formed hydrogen bonds with the side-chain oxygen atom of Thr243 and the main-chain nitrogen atom of Gly240 (Figure 1(b)). The opposite side of the ring outside the C5 and C6 atoms was blocked by the propionate sidechain of the heme, which shifted upwards in response to the movement of Arg292 (Figure 2(b) and (c)), which made no space for the C3 carboxyl group on this side. Therefore, the nicotinic acid ring and the nicotinamide ring of NADH are unlikely to adopt an anti-conformation, in which the pro-S side faces the NO molecule. Thr243 located in the I-helix corresponds to the Thr residue highly conserved in P450s.22 The conserved Thr residue is thought to play a crucial role by providing protons for monooxygenase reactions, cooperating with an Asp residue that is conserved as the N-terminal neighbor of the Thr residue.23­25 However, the neighbor on the Nterminal side of Thr243 of P450nor is Ala242. It is thus unlikely that a proton-providing system similar to that in monooxygenase P450s mediated by the Thr-Asp couple operates in the enzymatic reaction of P450nor. On the other hand, mutations of the Thr243 residue decrease the rate of the reduction step greatly.26 Thus, the role of this residue in the reduction step remained obscure.27 The present NAAD complex structure revealed that Thr243 is the only residue whose side-chain recognizes the carboxyl group of the nicotinic acid

ring directly (Figure 1(b)), and it is considerably ° distant from the catalytic center (5.1 A between the g Thr243 O and NAAD C4 atoms). Therefore, we conclude that Thr243 is important for the binding of NADH, but not for proton delivery. Thr243 plays a crucial role in the accommodation of the nicotinic acid ring, and possibly the nicotinamide ring in the case of NADH, in a stereo-selective manner in concert with the propionate side-chain of the heme noted above. In the ligand-free structure, the hydroxyl group of Thr243 side-chain forms an unusual hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Ala239 through two water molecules, resulting in complete disruption and stretching of the I-helix at this position. 10 A remarkable movement was observed on NAAD binding around here. On NAAD binding, the I-helix moved away from the heme, and the peptide bond between Ala239 and Gly240 flipped, making the main-chain oxygen atom of Ala239 become opposite to NAAD (Figure 2(c)). Conversely, the main-chain amide nitrogen atom of Gly240 faces the heme side and is hydrogen-bonded directly with the carboxyl group of NAAD (Figure 1(b)). The peptide flipping at the Ala239-Gly240 peptide bond induces slight bending of the I-helix at this position, resulting in appropriate positioning of Thr243 and Gly240 for direct interaction with the carboxyl group of NAAD. The sequence of A/G-G-X-X-T is highly conserved in the I-helices of P450s,22 possibly endowing flexibility on the long helix at this site. This motif is utilized for formation of the oxygen (O2)-binding pocket in monooxygenase P450s,21 but diverted in P450nor for NAD(P)H binding. Proton channel In the heme-distal pocket of the Fe 3C­NO structure, Ser286 and Asp393 form a hydrogenbonding network with a few water molecules, which is considered to be a proton delivery pathway from the solvent to the active site in the reduction step.13 Of these water molecules, Wat74, Wat292, and Wat46 were excluded by the nicotinic acid ring in the NAAD complex structure (Figure

4(c)), which disrupted the terminal part of the hydrogen-bonding network. Furthermore, the network extending to Thr243 was interrupted by the bound NAAD molecule. In the NAAD complex ° structure, however, Wat261 was positioned 3.4 A from the C4 atom of the nicotinic acid ring, forming a rearranged hydrogen-bonding network connected to the solvent (Figure 4(c)). The side-chains of Ser286 and Asp393 are involved in the rearranged hydrogen-bonding network in the NAAD complex structure.

Discussion
The structural features of the NAD(P)H channel are quite unique among nucleotide-binding proteins. Two Arg residues fix the dinucleotide molecule like the axis of a seesaw. Even the sidechain of the bound cofactor (heme) participates in the stereo-selectivity of the bound nicotinamide (nicotinic acid) ring. The heme-distal pocket comprises three surfaces, those below the B 0 -helix, below the F, G-loop, and on the Asp393 side (Figure 4(a)). The former two surfaces form the access channel for NAD(P)H (NAAD), and the Asp393 side forms a proton delivery network (proton channel). Thus, two channels for NAD(P)H and protons, respectively, are formed in parallel with each other from the entrance of the pocket to the vicinity of the heme in the NAAD complex (Figure 4). The face below the F, G-loop is hydrophobic, containing only one charged residue, Arg174. The ionic interaction in the hydrophobic environment between Arg174 and the pyrophosphate moiety of the dinucleotide should be the strongest. By contrast, the face below the B 0 -helix is hydrophilic, containing the charged cluster. In response to the completely different environments on the two sides of the access channel, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic sides of bound NAAD face the F, G-loop and B 0 -helix sides, respectively. The proton channel side is hydrophilic and the distal pocket is shallower on this side than the other NAD(P) access channel side, making it possible for a shorter channel for protons.

215 and Asp88 upon binding of a pyridine nucleotide cofactor would be energetically unfavorable, resulting in lower affinity for NAD(P)H or NAD(P)C. This mechanism should be essential for rapid release of NAD(P)C to realize the abnormally high catalytic turnover.6,7 In other words, P450nor has attained the high catalytic turnover number at the expense of the affinity for NAD(P)H. This is consistent with the low affinity of P450nor for NAD(P)H.15 The high catalytic turnover must be essential for the detoxification of NO, the hazardous molecule being extinguished rapidly.6,30

binds in close vicinity to the heme in a stereoselective manner, the pro-R side of its C4 atom facing the NO molecule bound to the heme. The results are consistent with our previous observations concerning the significant kinetic isotope effect of [4R-2H]-NADH on the reduction step yielding form I (Reaction 3) as well as the successful formation of I upon reduction of the Fe3C­NO complex with borohydride.8 The present and previous results strongly support the direct transfer of a hydride ion from the pro-R side of NADH to the Fe3C­NO complex to form intermediate I. The sidechain of Ser286 is located closest to the C4 atom of nicotinic acid or the oxygen atom of NO bound to the heme (Figures 2(c) and 4). The mutation involving replacement of Ser286 with an Ala or Val residue decreases the I-forming activity greatly.13,20 Furthermore, the bound NAAD is involved in formation of the hydrogen bond network by fixing Wat287 (Figure 4(c)). Involvement of the NAAD molecule itself in the rearranged hydrogen-bond network is good evidence that the hydride transfer and proton delivery are events that occur continuously during the reduction step yielding to form I. Therefore, we conclude that a hydride and a proton (corresponding to two electrons and two protons) are provided simultaneously in this reduction step (Reaction 3), supporting our previous proposal, that the chemical substance of I is equivalent to a ferric­hydroxylamine radical complex.8 Modulation of the salt-bridge network Glu71Arg64-Asp88 on NAAD binding is intriguing. The interaction between Arg64 and Asp88 is broken on NAAD binding. We showed recently that the mutation involving replacement of Asp88 with an Ala or a Val residue causes a great decrease in the overall nitric oxide reductase activity without blocking of the I-formation step, suggesting that a process subsequent to I formation is blocked by the D88A or D88V mutation.28 We have examined such mutants as to all charged or hydrophilic amino acid residues in the distal pocket. Asp88 is unique, in that it is the sole residue among them, the mutation of which caused inactivation of the enzyme without blocking of the I-forming step. We suggested that release of NADC from the intermediate after the electron transfer was blocked by the mutation. On the other hand, Glu71 is essential for I formation. The E71A mutation blocked the I-formation step as well as decreased the binding affinity for an NAD analogue dinucleotide.29 These mutant analyses results are consistent with the present structural results. Glu71 seems to pull and fix Arg64 on NAAD binding (Figure 2), and thus to be important for the cofactor binding. By contrast, Asp88 destabilizes the structure of the complexes with the dinucleotides, and thus the D88A or D88V mutation is favorable for tight binding of NADH/ NADC.28 The present and previous results highlight the unique function of the salt-bridge network.
