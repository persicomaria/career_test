Structure of murine angiogenin: features of the substrate- and cell-binding regions and prospects for inhibitor-binding studies
Angiogenin is an unusual member of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily that induces blood-vessel formation and is a promising anticancer target. The three-dimensional structure of murine angiogenin (mAng) has been determined by X-ray crystallography. Two structures are presented: one is ∞ a complex with sulfate ions (1.5 A resolution) and the other a ∞ complex with phosphate ions (1.6 A resolution). Residues forming the putative B1, P1 and B2 subsites occupy positions similar to their hAng counterparts and are likely to play similar roles. The anions occupy the P1 subsite, sulfate binding conventionally and phosphate adopting two orientations, one of which is novel. The B1 subsite is obstructed by Glu116 and Phe119, with the latter assuming a less invasive position than its hAng counterpart. Hydrophobic interactions between the C-terminal segment and the main body of the protein are more extensive than in hAng and may underly the lower enzymatic activity of the murine protein. Elsewhere, the structure of the H3≠B2 loop supports the view that hAng Asn61 interacts directly with cell-surface molecules and does not merely stabilize adjacent regions of the hAng structure. mAng crystals appear to offer small-molecule inhibitors a clear route to the active site and may even withstand a reorientation of the C-terminal segment that provides access to the cryptic B1 subsite. These features represent considerable advantages over crystalline hAng and bAng.

1. Introduction
Angiogenin (Ang) is an angiogenic protein originally isolated from the conditioned medium of HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Fett et al., 1985). It plays a role in tumour angiogenesis (Olson et al., 1995, 2001, 2002; Kao et al., 2002) and its increased expression has been correlated with diverse cancers in more than 20 clinical studies to date (see Kao et al., 2002). Antagonists of Ang inhibit the establishment, progression and metastasis of human tumour xenografts in athymic mice (Olson et al., 1995, 2001, 2002; Kao et al., 2002), identifying it as a promising target for anticancer therapy. Human Ang (hAng) has been the subject of intensive functional and structural analyses. It is a member of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily (Kurachi et al., 1985; Strydom et al., 1985) and possesses a weak ribonucleolytic activity that is essential for angiogenicity (Shapiro et al., 1989; Shapiro & Vallee, 1989; Curran, Shapiro & Riordan, 1993). Its three-dimensional structure (Acharya et al., 1994; Lequin et al., 1997; Leonidas, Shapiro, Allen et al., 1999) is broadly similar to that of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A; EC 3.1.27.5), with which it shares 33% sequence identity. Engineered hAng variants have enabled the identification of

structural elements that govern its characteristic cell binding (Harper & Vallee, 1989; Hallahan et al., 1991, 1992; Shapiro & Vallee, 1992; Holloway et al., 2002), nuclear translocation (Moroianu & Riordan, 1994) and enzymatic (Harper & Vallee, 1988, 1989; Shapiro et al., 1989; Shapiro & Vallee, 1989; Curran, Shapiro & Riordan, 1993; Curran, Shapiro, Riordan et al., 1993; Russo et al., 1994, 1996; Shapiro, 1998; Leonidas, Shapiro, Allen et al., 1999; Holloway et al., 2002, 2004; Leonidas et al., 2002) activities. Once it reaches the nucleus, Ang stimulates rRNA transcription, playing a key role in endothelial cell proliferation that is necessary for angiogenesis induced by other angiogenic factors (Kishimoto et al., 2005; Tsuji et al., 2005). Despite yielding much information, study of the human protein has limitations. Firstly, there are obvious practical difficulties in studying the role of hAng in healthy living subjects. Secondly, in all known crystal forms of hAng variants, key residues in the ribonucleolytic active site are intimately involved in crystal packing (Leonidas et al., 2001). This has prevented visualization of the binding of known lowmolecular-weight substrates and inhibitors, in turn hampering the rational design of potential anticancer agents. It has also obscured the precise nature of the change in protein conformation that is believed to accompany the binding of pyrimidine nucleotides (Russo et al., 1994). The crystal structure of bovine Ang (bAng; Acharya et al., 1995) has proved to have similar limitations. The murine Ang (mAng) system may offer solutions to the experimental problems outlined above. The mAng gene shares 76% sequence identity with hAng (Bond & Vallee, 1990) and is known to have comparable angiogenic activity and approximately one-third of its enzymatic activity (Nobile et al., 1996). In addition, the murine genome encodes five additional Ang-like proteins that appear to have undergone positive selection (Brown et al., 1995; Fu & Kamps, 1997; Strydom, 1998; Cho et al., 2005). At least one of these is angiogenic (Fu et al., 1999), but others may have different functions (Nobile et al., 1996; Cho et al., 2005). Established protein-engineering and murine gene-disruption techniques provide the means for probing the physiological roles of these proteins, while the continued use of structural biology techniques will be essential for the validation and interpretation of such experiments. As a first step along this route, we present here two X-ray crystal structures of mAng. We assess their similarity to the structure of hAng, focusing on regions involved in RNA cleavage and cell binding. We also examine the suitability of these crystals for the visualization of small-molecule inhibitor binding.

2.1. Protein preparation

mAng was prepared from the soluble extract of recombinant Escherichia coli W3110 by cation-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose and Mono-S media as described previously (Shapiro & Vallee, 1992; Nobile et al., 1996). The sample was mixed with 0.25 volumes of 1 M potassium phosActa Cryst. (2005). D61, 1568≠1578

Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique. Drops were prepared by mixing 2 ml protein solution (15 mg ml¿1) with 2 ml reservoir solution and were incubated at 289 K suspended over 0.8 ml reservoirs. Two types of crystal were grown, mAng≠SO4 and mAng≠PO4. In the former case the reservoir solution was 25%(w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4 (unbuffered) and in the latter it was 25%(w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 5.2. mAng≠SO4 crystals were thin plates and reached their full size within 3 d. mAng≠PO4 crystals were thicker and grew more slowly, continuing their growth for 1≠2 months. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on station PX9.6 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Dares∞ bury, UK), which provided monochromatic radiation of 0.87 A

wavelength and was equipped with an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector. Data from two mAng≠SO4 crystals were merged and supplemented with further data from an in-house MAR Research 30 cm image plate mounted on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating-anode X-ray source emitting Cu K radiation. Data from a single mAng≠PO4 crystal were collected at the synchrotron. All data were indexed, scaled and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and intensities were truncated to amplitudes using TRUNCATE (French & Wilson, 1978). Detailed dataprocessing statistics are given in Table 1. model building using O (Jones et al., 1991). During the final stages, restrained refinement and electron-density map calculations were performed with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997). Those residues with partial density were truncated accordingly and residues for which there was no discernible density were omitted. Polyvalent anions were then incorporated, followed by the first two shells of water molecules. All water molecules had peaks of !3 in mFo ¿ DFc electrondensity maps. Detailed statistics for each model are given in Table 1. Model validation was conducted using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and the WHAT_CHECK server (Rodriguez et al., 1998). Structural superpositions were performed with LSQMAN (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994) and topological classification with PROMOTIF3 (Hutchinson & Thornton, 1996). Omit phases were calculated with SFCHECK (Vaguine et al., 1999). Figures were drawn using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA, USA).

2.3. Structure determination and refinement

Initial phases were determined by the molecular-replacement method as implemented in AMoRe (Navaza, 1994), employing a search model derived from the crystal structure of bAng (PDB code 1agi; Acharya et al., 1995). In this search model, residues 1 and 121≠125 were deleted and all nonglycine residues that differed from their counterparts in mAng were replaced by alanine. Clear solutions were obtained for both mAng≠SO4 and mAng≠PO4 and the resultant models were subjected to cycles of refinement in which simulated annealing, coordinate minimization and B-factor refinement ® with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) were alternated with manual

Orientation A is also similar to the single orientation observed in the hAng≠PO4 structure (PDB code 1hby; Leonidas et al., 2001; Fig. 2f), but with somewhat better hydrogen-bonding geometry (Table 2). Orientation B is substantially different and to our knowledge is novel (Fig. 2e). It is incompatible with conformation B of His113, but permits hydrogen bonds with all the above P1 residues except Lys40. Sulfate binds to the P1 subsite in a single orientation that is offset slightly from phosphate orientation A (Fig. 2d). Although some specifics of the hydrogen bonds are different (His13 bonds to O3 instead of O1, His113 bonds in conformation A only and Gln12 bonds in conformation A rather than conformation B; Table 2), the same five residues ligate the anion.

This is also a characteristic of the bAng structure, which features an equivalent Leu!Phe substitution. The closed conformation of hAng is stabilized by Gln117≠ Thr44 and Ser118≠Asp116 hydrogen bonds and by the hydrophobic packing of the Ile119 and Phe120 side chains against the main body of the protein (Harper & Vallee, 1988; Curran, Shapiro, Riordan et al., 1993; Russo et al., 1994, 1996; Shapiro, 1998; Leonidas et al., 2002). In mAng, the hydrogen bonds are comparable (Table 3) while, as a consequence of several amino-acid substitutions (Phe114 for Leu115, Phe118 for Ile119, Tyr64 for His65), the hydrophobic interactions are more extensive. In more detail, the side chains of Phe118 and

Phe119 (the counterparts of Ile119 and Phe120 in hAng) are cradled in a pocket lined by residues from six -strands (Fig. 4). These residues can be divided into those that form the pocket base (Met70, Val77, Arg100, His101 and Val102) and those that form a collar (Thr44, Tyr64, Thr79, Val103 and Phe114). Both Phe118 and Phe119 make extensive contacts with residues from each layer (Figs. 4a and 4c). In contrast, Ile119 and Phe120 of hAng interact closely with the base (and with each other) but much less so with the collar (Figs. 4b and 4d).
3.4. Structure of the B2 subsite and the H3≠B2 loop

shows that the type I -turn is present in a modified form (Gly58-Ala59-Asn60-Gly61). The extended torsional freedom of the two glycine residues in the turn prevents perturbation of helix H3 and strand B2. Asn60 (the counterpart of hAng Asn61) makes no direct contact with the rest of the protein (Fig. 5). Instead, the Asn60 side chain adopts a more solventexposed orientation in which it is free to hydrogen bond with Lys72 from a symmetry-related molecule (not shown). A network of water molecules separates Asn60 from Ser52 and Asn73 (the counterparts of hAng Ser52 and Ser74), suggesting that the side chain of Asn 60/61 is not essential for the positioning of residues 52 and 73/74.
3.5. Crystal packing and the potential binding of inhibitors

The B2 subsite binds the nucleotide base positioned downstream of the scissile phosphodiester bond. In RNase A, adenine binding involves nonpolar interactions with the side chains of His119 (≠ stacking), Cys65 and Ala109, strong hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Asn71 and transient hydrogen bonds to Asn67, Gln69 and Glu111 (Richards et al., 1970; Tarragona-Fiol et al., 1993; Fontecilla-Camps et al., 1994; Zegers et al., 1994; Toiron et al., 1996). Several of these residues are contributed by a disulfide-stabilized loop (residues 65≠72) located between strands B2 and B3. In Ang-family members, this loop and its disulfide bridge are not conserved and the structure of the B2 subsite is not easily discerned (Leonidas, Shapiro, Allen et al., 1999). The subsite may be rather rudimentary, perhaps limited to counterparts of the nonpolar elements of the RNase A subsite, i.e. residues His114, Leu69 and Ala106 in hAng. These three residues are conserved in mAng and occupy positions similar to their hAng counterparts. Any interactions that they make with substrates are likely to be conserved. The roles of RNase A and Ang residues in the region of strand B2 have diverged over the course of evolution. Whereas several of these residues are employed by RNase A for substrate binding (as described above), a subset (residues 60≠68 in hAng) is implicated in the interaction of Ang with the surface of endothelial cells (Leonidas, Shapiro, Allen et al., 1999). Among these is Asn61, which is located in the solventexposed loop that connects strand B2 to the preceding helix, H3. Proteolytic cleavage of the 60/61 peptide bond or deamidation of Asn61 to isoAsp abolishes angiogenic activity, but has no appreciable effect on enzymatic activity (Hallahan et al., 1991, 1992). Variants with either of these modifications lack the ability to inhibit Ang-induced neovascularization, indicating the perturbation of a critical cell-binding site. The importance of Asn61 may lie in its ability to interact directly with cell-surface molecules or in its role in stabilizing the structure of two adjacent regions with which it forms three hydrogen bonds (Asn61 N2--Ser52 O, Asn61 N2--Ser52 O and Ser74 N--Asn61 O1). The structure of mAng narrows down these possibilities. Whereas in hAng the H3≠B2 connection is a type I -turn comprising four residues (Glu58Asn59-Lys60-Asn61), in mAng the connection comprises only three (Gly58-Ala59-Asn60) and features two nonconservative substitutions. The electron-density map for this region is well defined in the mAng≠SO4 and mAng≠PO4 structures and

Crystal packing orients the central substrate-binding subsites of mAng (B1, P1 and B2) towards a well defined solvent channel. The accessibility of these subsites to a known dinucleotide inhibitor such as 50 -phospho-20 -deoxyuridine-30 pyrophosphate (P0 !50 ) adenosine 30 -phosphate (pdUppA30 -p; Russo et al., 2001) can be gauged by aligning each of the mAng structures with that of the RNase A≠pdUppA-30 -p complex (PDB code 1qhc; Leonidas, Shapiro, Irons et al., 1999) and superposing the dinucleotide coordinates with those of mAng. This type of analysis suggests that the pathway of such a ligand to the active site (the obstructive conformation of the C-terminus aside) is clear (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, none of the likely dinucleotide-binding residues make intermolecular crystal contacts. In order for a given small-molecule inhibitor to bind to Ang, it may be necessary for the C-terminus to disengage from the main body of the protein. For this to occur in a crystal-soaking experiment, there will need to be sufficient room for manoeuvre of the C-terminus within the crystal. In mAng crystals, the C-terminal segment approaches two symmetryrelated molecules (Fig. 6b), which we designate SYM MOL 1 (lattice position ¿b + c, symmetry operator ¿x + 1, y + 1, ¿z) 2 2 and SYM MOL 2 (lattice position ¿b, symmetry operator ¿x + 1, y + 1, ¿z). Owing to different degrees of ordering at 2 2 their N-termini, the mAng≠SO4 and mAng≠PO4 structures differ in the extent of the interaction. In mAng≠PO4 (which has the best ordered N-terminus), the C"1 atom of Phe118 lies ∞ 3.7 A from the C atom of Asp2 from SYM MOL 1. The two side chains make contact `end-on' and the C-terminal segment does not appear to be constrained by the interaction. Furthermore, in mAng≠SO4 the side chains of all residues upstream of Ser4 are disordered and no contact is evident. The C-terminal segment also approaches helix H2 and the preceding loop of SYM MOL 2 but does not make direct contact (Fig. 6b). Here, the main-chain conformation orientates the side chains of Lys19, Arg24 and Arg28 toward the C-terminal segment. However, in the mAng≠PO4 structure none of these side chains are ordered beyond C. In the mAng≠SO4 structure Arg24 shows electron density out to C, but the other two are again disordered beyond C. Thus, it appears that these side chains have considerable mobility within either crystal form.

likely to be a consequence of enhanced hydrophobic interactions at the C-terminus of mAng which stabilize the `closed' conformation, presenting a higher energetic barrier to substrate turnover. This view is supported by studies on the contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the C-terminal conformation of hAng. When these interactions are weakened 4. Discussion through the introduction of mutations at the C-terminus (I119A/F120A) or by exposure to methanol, enzymatic As might be expected on consideration of sequence homology activity is enhanced threefold to fourfold but substrate alone, the structure of mAng is extremely similar to that of specificity is unaffected (Russo et al., 1996; Leonidas et al., hAng. Nevertheless, minor differences between the two 2002). Hence, an increase in the hydrophobic interactions as orthologues have provided some insight into RNA-cleavage observed in mAng would be likely to cause a severalfold activity and cell binding. There are subtle differences between suppression of enzymatic activity. Next, whereas hAng has a the enzymatic properties of mAng and hAng (Nobile et al., 12-fold preference for C over U at the B1 subsite, mAng has a 1996; Shapiro, 1998). Firstly, the specific activity of mAng is only about one-third of that of hAng as judged by the ability somewhat stronger 35-fold preference. This suggests modifito cleave tRNA or dinucleotide substrates. This seems most cation of the recognition of the substituent(s) at positions 3 and/or 4 of the pyrimidine. There are no structural differences in the vicinity of Thr44 that might affect its ability to form hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen function at position 3 and the nature of the interaction with the heteroatom at position 4 is unknown. Nearby, two nonpolar residues are conservatively substituted (hAng Ile42!mAng Val42, hAng Leu115! mAng Phe114) and there is a small shift in the alignment of the C-terminal segment. However, it is not possible to predict what bearing this might have on C/U selectivity and the resolution of this issue awaits a Figure 5 direct observation of pyrimidine binding. In B2≠H3 loop. Stereoview in which mAng≠SO4 (carbon, gold; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red; sulfur, contrast, mAng and hAng have very similar orange) is superposed with hAng (PDB code 1b1i; Leonidas, Shapiro, Allen et al., 1999; grey). selectivities favouring A over G at the B2 Residues that interact with mAng Asn60 and hAng Asn61 are also shown. Dashed lines denote subsite (fourfold and threefold, respecpotential hydrogen bonds. In summary, mAng crystals appear to offer small-molecule inhibitors ample access to the active site and may even withstand a modest change in the conformation of the C-terminal segment.

tively). This is consistent with the conservation of the identity and positioning of the putative B2 subsite residues His114, Leu69 and Ala106 (hAng numbering). Finally, the mAng structure supports the view that the side chain of Asn61 in hAng binds directly to a molecule on the endothelial cell surface and does not merely stabilize adjacent segments of the hAng structure. The structures presented here indicate that in several respects crystalline mAng is a promising tool for the study of Ang structure≠function relationships, particularly those relating to enzymatic activity. Firstly, the catalytic and specificity-determining residues of the two orthologues superpose closely, suggesting that small-molecule inhibitors targeted to the central substrate-binding subsites will bind to each orthologue in similar ways. Secondly, the crystal packing arrangement should permit the approach of such inhibitors to their targets and there is some (albeit limited) scope for conformational rearrangement of the C-terminus that might provide access to the cryptic B1 subsite. These features represent considerable advantages over crystalline hAng and bAng.
