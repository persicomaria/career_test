Despite the fact the first first X-ray diffraction diagrams of starch were reported in the 1930s (I) , unambiguous description of the native crystalline arrangement is not yet complete. Kainuma and French (2) were the first to suggest a double-stranded helix for the B polymorph (commonly found in tubers). This origianl proposal was extensively considered by Wu and Sarko (3,4) who arrived at the conclusion that both B and A types (found in cereals) can be described as right-handed, parallel-stranded double helices, packed in an antiparallel fashion. However, A and B polymorphs differ considerably in the crystalline packing of the duplexes. Current models derived from biochemical data (5,6) rely only on parallel arrangements of molecules. Similar arguments about chain polarity also arise from biosynthetic considerations; it would be more reasonable to expect parallel packing of parallel-stranded double helices since all the chains would have the same polarity. There is therefore a discrepancy between the currently accepted models (7). The present paper is concerned with the threedimensional structure analysis of the A-type polymorph . New crystallographic data were obtained by using two complementary methods: electron diffraction on single, micron-sized crystals (8) and deconvolution of X-ray powder patterns (9) into individual peaks. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction diagrams recorded were similar to those displayed by native cereal starch granules and those corresponding to fibrallar samples. They all can be indexed using an orthorhombic-like unit cell having a volume of -2.2 nrrr'. According to the measured density of 1.48, 12 glucose residues, together with a few water molecules, can be accommodated in the unit cell. Computer modelling of IX (1-4)-linked glucose units indicated that the observed repeat of c = 1.069 nm can either correspond to an extended conformation of a maltotriose unit or to a shallow conformation of a maltoheaxose unit. Therefore, three structural hypotheses had to be tested against their packing constraints: (i) four single three-fold helices (n = 3, h = 0.355 nm); (ii) two six-fold helices (n == 6, h = 0.178 nm); and (iii) two double six-fold helices repeating in 2c = 2.139 nm [in order to restore the observed repeat of 1.069 nm, each double helix has to be parallel stranded, the single strands (n = 6, h = 0.355 nm) being associated to its counterpart through a two-fold axis]. All cases were thoroughly examined and only the latter was Shown to be a valid candidate. Further molecular modelling showed that the conformation at the glycosidic linkage corresponds to the intersectionof n = 6 and h -0.355 nm (left-handed chirality) (Figure I). Such a situation corresponds to one of the stable energy minima (10) and is reminiscent of the observed conformation of a crystalline amylose oligomer (11). Assembling two such parallel single strands through a two-fold symmetry operation permits forma© IRL Press Limited, Oxford, England

tions of a double helix having no short contacts. Information about the crystallographic symmetry elements relating two such double helices in the unit cell was provided by electron diffraction data. All the systematic absences derived from the electron diffractograms were indicative of a body-centered lattice. For an orthorhombic system only two space groups (1222 or 12)2 12 1) are possible for chiral molecules. However, none of them is able to accommodate two double-helical chains, and one has to select a system of lower symmetry. The only solution remained the face-centered monoclinic space group B2, with the fiber axis C as the unique axis. After proper transformation, the crystal data are a = 2.124nm,b = l.l72nm,c = 1.069nmand)' = 123.5*; space group B2. Electron diffraction provided proof of monoclinic symmetry. By sequential tilting about an axis perpendicular to the crystal axis, some hkl and <hkl (in the orthorhombic denomination) reflection intensities could be compared and were found to be unequal, contrary to expectations for an orthorhombic symmetry. In the B2 space group, the asymmetric unit is made up of a maltotriose moiety. The double helices have to sit on the crystallographic two-fold axis located respectively at the corners of the cell and in the middle of the faces (a,c); they are related by a simple translation: al2 + el2. Their parallel arrangement is imposed de facto by the symmetry elements of the space group. Several putative models (left-handed and right-handed chains along with different orientations of the primary hydroxl groups) were checked against both packing constraints and experimental data, with the aid of the LALS procedure (12) using diffraction intensities from powder, and diffraction intensities from fiber as taken from the work of Wu and Sarko (4), after proper reindexing of the reflections.

model, the two independent runs converged to the same orientation of the helices in the unit cell. The model with left-handed double helices having the primary hydroxyl groups in the gauche-gauche orientation had much better three-dimensional R-factors than the alternatives; no steric conflict between the chains was found. Judging by the measured density of the crystals, four water molecules can be accommodated per unit cell. The two-dimensional location of the water molecules was determined by calculating the two-dimensional R-values in a stepwise fashion. As for the location about the fiber direction, contact criteria were used. In the last step of the refinement, all the valence angles and torsion angles at the glycosidic bridges were allowed to vary, along with the exo-cyclic torsion angles of the primary hydroxl groups. The final three-dimensional crystallographic factors are R = 0.27 and R = 0.24 for powder and fiber diffraction intensities respectively (in two-dimensions, they are respectively, 0.17 and 0.19). The observed and calculated X-ray powder diffraction patterns are shown in Figure 2. All A-type crystalline samples studied here (in vitro grown single crystals, polycrystalline samples, fibrilar samples) exhibit the same scattering features and therefore the same crystal and molecular organization as the crystalline components of native cereal starches. The repeating unit consists of a maltotriose moiety where the glucose residues have the 4C1 conformation and are a (1-4) linked. The conformation of the glycosidic linkage is characterized by torsion angles (¢, 1/;) which take the values (91.8*, -153.2*), (85.7*, -145.3*) and (91.8*, -151.3*); all the primary hydroxyl groups 457

exist in a gauche - gauche conformation. There is no intra-strand hydrogen bond. Within the double helix, inter-strand stabilization is achieved without any steric conflict and through the occurrences of 0(2)-0(6) hydrogen bonds . There are two such bonds per glucose residue . The inner dimension of the double helix cavity is 0 .35 nm in diameter which does not allow any water molecule to pack into the hole , while the outer diameter is about 1.03 nm. A representation of the three-dimensional structure is shown on Figure 3 (13) where it is clear that such an arrangement obeys the law of close packing. The B2 space group appears to be well suited for dense packing, since the symmetry operations permit the nesting of neighbouring double helices which have pronounced 'crests' and 'troughs'. The cohesion between these double helices is further achieved through a series of hydrogen bonds involving distances ranging from 0.263 to 0.278 nm. It is surprising to see the limited amount of water present in the structure, as well as its minor role in establishing the three-dimensional features. The present results establish that the A-type polymorph is characterized by a parallel packing of left-handed, parallel-stranded double-helices . The formation of double-helical structures involving short amylose chains appears to be an ubiquitous phenomenon governed either by biosynthesis (in the starch granule) , or by simple thermodynamic

rules (crystallization from solution). The formation of such double helices in solution has been postulated to explain two major properties of starch: gelatinization and retrogradation (14). The size of short branches of amylopectin (12 - 20 glucose residues for cereal starches) is ideal for the formation of double helices; these chains are densely packed in crystallites arranged radially in the granule. Therefore, the new three dimensional structure of amylose A, and more precisely of the linear branches of amylopectin in A-starch, is consistent with the 'cluster' model of amylopectin (6) as well as with the overall architecture of the starch granule (15).
