INTRODUCTION LOC79017 (MW 21.0 kDa, residues 1­188) was annotated as a hypothetical protein encoded by Homo sapiens chromosome 7 open reading frame 24. It was selected as a target by the Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics (CESG) because it did not share more than 30% sequence identity with any protein for which the three-dimensional structure is known. The biological function of the protein has not been established yet. Parts of LOC79017 were identified as members of uncharacterized Pfam families (residues 1­95 as PB006073 and residues 104­180 as PB031696).1 BLAST searches revealed homologues of LOC79017 in many eukaryotes, but none of them have been functionally characterized.2 Here, we report the crystal structure of H. sapiens protein LOC79017 (UniGene code Hs.530024, UniProt code O75223, CESG target number go.35223). MATERIALS AND METHODS The gene of LOC79017 was cloned and selenomethionyl protein was purified following the standard CESG pipeline protocol for cloning,3 protein expression,4 protein purification,5 and overall information management.6 Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop method from 10 mg/mL protein solution in buffer (50 mM NaCl, 3 mM NaN3, 0.3 mM TCEP, 5 mM BisTris pH 8.0) mixed with an equal amount of reservoir solution containing 28% (w/v) PEG 2K, 0.2M potassium glutamate, 50 mM sodium acetate, 50 mM MES pH 5.5 at 48C. The crystals were soaked in reservoir solutions supplemented with

increasing amounts of ethylene glycol up to 10% (w/v) and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at The General Medicine and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team (GM/CA-CAT) 23ID-D beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory at 100 K. The diffraction images were processed with HKL2000.7 The selenium substructure of the crystal was determined by using SHELXD8 and HySS from PHENIX,9,10 and the selenium positions were used for single wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing in AUTOSHARP.11 The initial model was built by the automatic tracing procedure of ARP/wARP,12 and the structure was completed using alternating cycles of manual building in COOT13 and refinement in REFMAC5.14 The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed using MolProbity.15 Identification of hydrogen bonds and calculation of surface area were performed using WHATIF.16 PyMol was used to assign secondary structures and generate figures.17 The final coordinates were

side of the barrel and the b-sheet is located at one of the barrel's open ends. The C-terminal domain [residues 136­183, cyan in Fig. 1(A)] contains three a-helices (a3­ a5), which are assembled together on another side of the barrel and also interact with the three-stranded b-sheet and the helix a1. The observed domain organization is different from the segments predicted Pfam clustering. In the asymmetric unit, LOC79017 forms a dimer with approximate 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry [Fig. 1(B)]. A root mean square deviation (rmsd) for Ca ° atoms between the two monomers is 0.2 A. The dimeri° zation buries 1640 A2 of solvent accessible surface area and involves 13 hydrogen bonds. The dimeric interface is stabilized by contacts between the b6 strand of each monomer, essentially forming a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (b6, b7 in each monomer) across the interface. Results from gel filtration chromatography and mass spectrometry also support dimeric state of LOC79017 (data not shown). VAST search found four structural neighbors of LOC79017.19 Arabidopsis thaliana protein At5g39720.1 ° (PDB code 2G0Q)20 has an rmsd of 1.6 A, a VAST score

deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank18 with accession number 2I5T. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The crystal structure of LOC79017 from H. sapiens ° was determined to a resolution of 2.0 A using single wavelength anomalous diffraction. Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The asymmetric unit of the structure contains two LOC79017 monomers and 141 water molecules. Several N- and C-terminal residues (residues 1­13 and 183­188 for chain A; residues 1­14 and 184­188 for chain B) were not included in the model due to insufficient electron density. The monomeric structure of LOC79017 contains five a-helices (a1­a5) and eight b-strands (b1­b7), and is organized in two domains [Fig. 1(A)]. The N-terminal domain [residues 14­135, red in Fig. 1(A)] comprises a five-stranded antiparallel b-barrel (b1, b2, b5­b7) surrounded by two a-helices (a1, a2) and a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (b3, b4, b8). The helices flank one

of 9.2 and 22% sequence identity for 101 aligned Ca atoms. Mus musculus protein 13879365 (PDB code ° 1VKB)21 has an rmsd of 1.7 A, a VAST score of 9.4 and 22% sequence identity for 94 aligned Ca atoms. Pyrococcus horikoshii protein PH0828 (PDB code 1V30)22 has ° an rmsd of 1.5 A, a VAST score of 10.8 and 16% sequence identity for 84 aligned Ca atoms. Escherichia coli protein ytfP from (PDB code 1XHS) has an rmsd of ° 1.7 A, a VAST score of 11.2 and 19% sequence identity for 81 aligned Ca atoms. These proteins are functionally uncharacterized. The structures of the four neighbors all contain a b-barrel with adjacent a-helices and a b-sheet at one of its open ends as found in the N-terminal domain of LOC79017. However, C-terminal regions of the five proteins are structurally variable. The crystal structure of LOC79017 revealed extra electron density in a cavity surrounded by the b-barrel and flanking a-helices [Fig. 1(C)]. The extra electron density was found in both monomers in the asymmetric unit with very similar shapes. The mass of a potential ligand or modification corresponding to this electron density was estimated at 100­300 Da. However, we were unable to convincingly fit any chemical reagents used in purification or crystallization into this electron density. Attempts to identify a ligand or modification corresponding to this unknown electron density using tryptic digestion and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) were also unsuccessful. Among the four structural neighbors, the structures of M. musculus 13879365 and P. horikoshii PH0828 have been solved by X-ray crystallography and revealed ligands (CHES and formic acid molecules, respectively) in the structurally conserved cavity surrounded by their b-barrel and a-helices. In both cases, the bound ligands were from crystallization reagents. Many residues located in the cavity are completely conserved or conservatively substituted in LOC79017 and the four structural neighbors. The residues include Tyr22, Gly23, Ser24, Leu94, Tyr105, and Tyr125. Considering the presence of the extra electron density/ligands and the conservation at the sequence and structure levels, it is most likely that the cavity has a crucial role in the function of LOC79017 and its structural neighbors possibly as an active site or ligand-binding site. Combined with the structural information provided by this study, further biochemical and biophysical analysis of LOC79017 including identification of the unknown ligand would contribute to an understanding of this protein's function.
