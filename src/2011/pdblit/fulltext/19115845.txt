Cdc7 kinase is a key regulator of the S-phase of the cell cycle, known to promote the activation of DNA replication origins in eukaryotic organisms. Cdc7 inhibition can cause tumor-cell death in a p53-independent manner, supporting the rationale for developing Cdc7 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. In this paper, we conclude the structure-activity relationships study of the 2-heteroaryl-pyrrolopyridinone class of compounds that display potent inhibitory activity against Cdc7 kinase. Furthermore, we also describe the discovery of 89S, [(S)-2-(2-aminopyrimidin-4-yl)-7-(2-fluoro-ethyl)-1,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridin4-one], as a potent ATP mimetic inhibitor of Cdc7. Compound 89S has a Ki value of 0.5 nM, inhibits cell proliferation of different tumor cell lines with an IC50 in the submicromolar range, and exhibits in vivo tumor growth inhibition of 68% in the A2780 xenograft model.
Introduction The initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells requires the assembly of multiple proteins at origins together with the action of protein kinases. Among the proteins known to assemble at origins before the initiation of DNA synthesis are the origin recognition complex, Cdc6,a and the minichromosome maintenance complex, MCM. Together they constitute the "prereplicative" complex that is phosphorylated in the S-phase by at least two kinases, a cyclin-dependent kinase and the Cdc7 kinase. Phosphorylation is believed to activate the MCM

helicase, thus leading to the unwinding of the double-stranded DNA at origins of replication, and to the loading of DNA polymerases and accessory factors that participate in the synthesis of new DNA strands during chain elongation.1-3 The human Cdc7 gene was identified in the late 1990s,4-6 and its involvement in DNA replication and cell proliferation has been demonstrated.7-10 When it is bound to one of two regulatory subunits, Dbf4 or Drf1/Dbf4B,7,9,11 Cdc7 is activated and is able to phosphorylate several MCM subunits with some preference for MCM2.12 Two specific phosphorylation sites in MCM2, Ser40 and Ser53, have been linked to Cdc7 activity, and RNA interference studies have demonstrated that in vivo phosphorylation of these sites is completely dependent on Cdc7.13,14 We and others have previously shown that siRNA mediated Cdc7 depletion causes a differential response in normal versus tumor-cell lines: tumor cells enter apoptosis in a p53independent manner15 while cell cycle progression is arrested in normal cells without loss of viability.10 At the molecular level, we found that blocking initiation of replication, in contrast to blocking DNA elongation, not only causes a failure in DNA replication but also fails to activate the critical DNA damage checkpoint, leaving open the possibility for the cell to undergo further damage and eventual death. Multiple anticancer agents that target DNA replication elongation are widely used in the clinic, among them gemcitabine, active metabolites of 5-fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea.16 The striking differences between the cellular responses to the inhibition of Cdc7 and the inhibition of DNA replication elongation by conventional chemotherapeutics, to which tumor cells can also become resistant in multiple ways,17,18 prompted us to search for small-molecule inhibitors of the Cdc7 kinase and to explore their potential in preclinical models as a novel class of anticancer drugs that tackle the same process through a different mechanism of action. In a previous communication,19 we described the discovery of 2-heteroaryl-pyrrolopyridinones as Cdc7 inhibitors, their

synthesis, and some details of the structure-activity relationships (SAR). We started from compound 1 (Figure 1), a scaffold formerly used for the preparation of MK2 inhibitors,20 and by examining variations at rings A, B, and C, we outlined the basic scaffold (Figure 1) and we identified the structural features that provide the best equilibrium between activity and selectivity. In addition, we showed that compound 1 itself is able to induce cell death in a broad panel of cell lines, including cell lines resistant to other replication inhibitors, and to cause tumor growth inhibition or tumor stabilization in different preclinical tumor models.21 The present paper completes the SAR analysis of these molecules through the expansion of the unexplored 6 and 7 positions. Thus, a series of compounds were prepared and evaluated for their potency against a panel of 38 kinases in proliferation assays and in a variety of cell-based mechanistic assays. Next, a small subset was selected for characterization of their in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties. Among the inhibitors synthesized, 89S (Figure 2) stands out as having the best balance in terms of tumor target kinase inhibition profile and pharmaceutical properties for development. Chemistry Our strategy for the preparation of pyrrolopyridinones is based on the following two protocols (for preparation and analytical data of compounds 1 and 5 see ref 19). 1. The Hantzsch reaction was used to prepare compounds 65, 68-76, and 78-95 (Scheme 1). According to this procedure, the commercially available heteroarylbromoketones 64 were reacted with piperidinediones 100 or 104 in ethanol at room temperature in the presence of ammonium acetate to obtain the final compounds 65, 68-76, and 78-95. Two compounds (96, 97) were obtained from 94 and 95, respectively. O-Debenzylation of the side chain by hydrogenolysis of 94 afforded 96 and treatment of 95 with boron trichloride at low temperature provided 97. 2. The intramolecular lactam ring closure of the structurally suited pyrrole precursor 106 in the very last step provided compounds 66, 67, and 77 (Scheme 2). Ketoesters 105 were accessed from -aminoacids 98 by a two-carbon extension process that was accomplished in two ways: directly, by means of monoethylmalonate potassium salt and carbonyldiimidazole in the presence of magnesium chloride,22 or via activation with Meldrum's acid,23 in the presence of EDC as the activating agent, followed by decarboxylation in boiling ethanol.

The preparation of the commercially unavailable precursors 106 was achieved by condensing the N-protected -ketoesters 105 with the bromoketone 64a and cyclizing the 1,4-diketone intermediate to the pyrrole ring under the Hantzsch reaction conditions, with ammonium acetate in ethanol at room temperature. Aminoesters 106 were finally deprotected in acid and cyclized under basic conditions, in the presence of potassium carbonate, affording pyrrolopyridinones 66, 67, and 77. For the synthesis of piperidinediones 104, one of the three methods depicted in Scheme 3 was used. In the first procedure, Meldrum's acid was reacted with the commercially available aminoacid derivatives 98 to obtain compounds 99. Next, they were cyclized in boiling ethyl acetate to the protected piperidinediones 100a-e that can be optionally deprotected to 104a-e in acidic conditions; for instance, trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane. In the second procedure, -amino-carboxyester derivatives 101 were reacted with ethyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate under basic conditions, affording amides 102 that were cyclized to piperidinediones 103f-l by heating in base; for example, in sodium methylate or ethylate in toluene. Their decarboxylation to piperidinediones 104f-l was accomplished by refluxing in acetonitrile/water. The third alternative allows for the rapid preparation of 5-substituted analogues because each variation is obtained by simply attaching the desired chain at the preformed piperidinedione ring.24 Commercially available N-Boc-piperidinedione 56 was reacted with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in tetrahydrofuran and treated with a suitable alkylating agent R-X, where X is iodo or bromo. The desired protected piperidinediones 100m-q were thus provided that could be optionally deprotected to 104m-q under acidic conditions such as trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane. The preparation of commercially unavailable -aminoesters 101 is shown in Scheme 4. The aminoesters were obtained as follows: 101f by amination of ethyl 3-methyl-but-2-enoate with ammonia under pressure and heating,25 101j from ethyl 2-cyano-2-ethyl-butanoate by hydrogenation catalyzed by platinum oxide, and 101g25 and 101l by exhaustive catalytic hydrogenation of ethyl 2-cyano-3methyl-2-butenoate and ethyl cyano-cyclobutylidene-acetate, respectively. Ethyl cyano-cyclobutylidene-acetate was in turn prepared from cyclobutanone and ethyl cyanoacetate under acidic conditions, with acetic acid and ammonium acetate.26 Results and Discussion Having defined the basic scaffold of pyrrolopyridinones in a previous study,19 we concentrated our effort on positions 6 and

7. With the exclusion of gem-disubstituted analogues, the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds induced asymmetry into the molecule. The stereogenic center was created in a nonstereospecific manner and, therefore, the SAR was carried out with the racemates. Once a few molecules were chosen from the eligible candidates, chiral chromatographic separation provided the single enantiomers. To understand the influence of substitutions at position 6, the same set of substituents was introduced and compared in the two series of pyridinyl and aminopyrimidinyl derivatives (Table 1). The substituents are almost exclusively alkyl groups, a choice dictated by the need to increase lipophilicity (cLogP is as low as -1 in the unsubstituted precursors) with the hope of improving the suboptimal cell permeability (1.84 ×10-6 cm/s measured for 1 in the PAMPA assay)27,28 and the correlated cellular activity. Surprisingly, although different substituents gave a variation in the IC50 values for both series, they did not have a major influence on the cellular activity. As for position 6, the influence of substitutions at position 7 on activity was established by introducing the same set of substituents in the two series and comparing them with the unsubstituted analogues (Table 2). In both series, the presence of the R7 groups enhanced cellular activity: by 2-6 fold in pyridinyl analogues and by 3-8 fold in aminopyrimidinyl analogues. Comparing the same substituents (namely methyl, isopropyl and gem-dimethyl) at positions 6 and 7 of the pyridinyl (Table 3) and aminopyrimidinyl (Table 4) derivatives, it is apparent that only the substituents at position 7 ensure 2-6 fold higher cellular activity in both series.

While developing the first generation of Cdc7 inhibitors, we decided that the concomitant inhibition of other kinases involved in cell cycle regulation, such as Cdk2 and PLK1, was to be avoided as much as possible because it could potentially mask the biological effects of Cdc7 inhibition. Thus, the compounds were tested against a panel of 38 kinases to evaluate their levels of selectivity. Interestingly selectivity determinations distinguish between 7-substituted aminopyrimidinyl and pyridinyl derivatives, as the former series shows selectivity ratios greater than 30 versus Cdk2A, a kinase that frequently cross-reacts with Cdc7 inhibitors,19 while the latter derivatives are 2-3 times less selective against Cdk2A. In the case of aminopyrimidinyls, 1 out of 38 kinases (TAO3) was inhibited at IC50 < 50 nM versus 3 out of 38 kinases (Cdk2A, GSK3 , PLK1) inhibited at IC50 < 50 nM for pyridinyls. With the exception of the gem-dialkyl derivatives (90, 91) that experience a strong loss of selectivity versus many kinases, all 7-substituted aminopyrimidinyl derivatives demonstrate an improved cell-activity/selectivity profile with respect to the unsubstituted parent compound 5. For this reason, they were chosen for further development. A few new derivatives carrying heteroatoms in their chains were also prepared in order to explore the sugar pocket region for additional binding interactions. As expected from the docking of compound 1 into the predicted ATP pocket of the kinase obtained from a homology model,19 a hydroxyl group inserted in the aliphatic chain protruding from position 7 could mimic the hydroxyl groups of the ATP sugar ring and a fluoro atom could establish electrostatic interactions with the carbons of the

backbone carbonyls. From this limited survey, only compounds 93 and 94 emerged as acceptably active on cells (Table 5). However, although both compounds are active on cells, they demonstrate slight differences in selectivity; 93 was sufficiently selective with none out of 38 kinases inhibited at IC50 < 100 nM, while 94 inhibits 2 out of 38 kinases (Cdk2A, GSK3 ) at IC50 < 50 nM. To assess the influence of the configuration at position 7, derivatives 86-89 and 93 were selected for further investigations because they show acceptable cell activity with greater than 30-fold selectivity versus the other tested kinases. Thus, the racemic mixtures were separated by chiral column chromatography (see the Experimental Section) and the results were determined for the single enantiomers. As shown in Table 6, the impact of configuration on the Cdc7 activity is evident only for the isopropyl (87) and cyclobutyl (88) enantiomers. Among the most active compounds in cells 86-2, 87-2 and 88-2 display poorer levels of selectivity, showing inhibition against 3 out of 38 kinases (GSK3 , PLK1, and TAO3) at IC50 < 100 nM. Because 1 was shown to inhibit Cdk9,21 a kinase involved in the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and in transcriptional regulation of gene expression,29,30 all of the selected compounds were also tested for their capability to block Cdk9 activity in a biochemical assay. As can be seen from Table 6, most compounds inhibit Cdk9T,31 with IC50 values lower than 100 nM and less than 20 times the ratio with respect to Cdc7. Thus they can be defined as dual Cdc7/Cdk9 inhibitors. No attempts have been made to define the structure-activity relationship controlling the specificity for Cdc7 over Cdk9. As

mentioned in previous work,21 Cdk9 does not appear to be strictly essential for cell cycle division and the combination of transcriptional Cdk inhibition with either cell cycle or other types of cellular stress represents an opportunity for tackling leukemia and solid tumors. For these reasons, we do not consider the inhibitory activity on Cdk9 kinase as a limitation and, consequently, the choice of the compounds for development was not influenced by these observations. The most promising compounds from Table 6, 86-1, 89S, and 93-2, were chosen for additional investigation and their in vitro physicochemical ADME properties were determined (Table 7). Interestingly, these compounds are not distinguished by their in vitro parameters because they all are acceptably soluble, poorly permeable, metabolically stable, and only moderately bound to plasma proteins. In contrast, the in vivo results are more helpful because they suggest an overall superiority of compound 89S after intravenous (iv) and oral (po) administration (Table 8). Compound 89S displayed high clearance (3.7 L/h/kg), yet it was lowest among compounds tested. Compound 89S also had the highest volume of distribution at about 4-fold total body water, indicating extensive tissue distribution. Plasma levels for 89S were detectable up to 6 h postdosing, giving an apparent average terminal half-life of about 1 h, and the greatest AUC

(9.5 µM.h) after iv dosing. After po dosing, the Tmax of compound 89S was found to be 0.5 h, the terminal half-life was comparable to that after iv administration, suggesting that the rate of absorption does not interfere with the disposition of the compound, and the oral bioavailability was acceptable (F ) 53%). Most important, 89S showed the greatest AUC (5.0 µM · h). The pharmacokinetic properties of compound 89S were also assessed in Han-Wistar rats and in beagle dogs following both iv and po dosing (Table 9). After iv dosing in the rat, the compound displayed moderate clearance (1.8 L/h/kg) and a volume of distribution three times the total body water. After po dosing, detectable plasma levels were observed up to 24 h post dosing and the Tmax of the compound was found to be 0.25 h with acceptably high bioavailability (F ) 45%). In dogs, the

compound showed moderate-high clearance (3.2 L/h/kg) and a volume of distribution three times the total body water. Furthermore, in dogs, the renal clearance accounted for approximately 13% of the total clearance. After po dosing, the Tmax of the compound was found to be 0.3 h and the extent of the absorption was reasonable (F ) 50%). Because of the characteristics described above, 89S was selected for further in vitro and in vivo testing. As such, 89S was tested against a broader panel of tumor cell lines and found to be active against many of them. The observed potency was comparable to that observed against A2780 cells and 89S was always more potent than compound 1 (Table 10). Thus, further in vitro investigation was directed at demonstrating that the antiproliferative activity observed was mediated by Cdc7 inhibition. The compound was checked for its capacity to block the cell cycle and stop DNA synthesis by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation block. The cell cycle profile was studied on asyncronous HeLa cells, using fluorescence activated cell sorting (Figure 3). Cell population peaks showed a G1/S block to DNA content analysis showed accumulation of S-phase cells at 3 µM, with drastic decrease of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (from 35% to 3%), meaning that DNA synthesis in these tumor cells was impaired. Western blot analysis of the phosphorylation status of the known substrate MCM212 showed a corresponding inhibition of phosphorylation at the Cdc7 dependent sites Ser40 and Ser53,13 indicating that the antiproliferative activity of 89S is mediated by blocking Cdc7. Caspase 3 activation and sub-G1 accumulation indicate that the treatment with 89S causes apoptosis in the cells (Figure 4). Figure 5 shows that the minimum dose necessary to achieve Cdc7 kinase inhibition, after 4 h of treatment of A2780 cells with 89S, was 0.6 µM, corresponding to the IC50 of proliferation in this cell line. This result indicates that the mechanism of action of the compound strongly correlates with Cdc7 inhibition. These features, coupled with good solubility in vehicles (10 mg/ mL in 5% dextrose, in 5% Tween 80 in dextrose solution, and in 50% PEG 400 in dextrose solution), excellent metabolic stability (CLint is 0.3 L/h/kg at the concentration of 1 µM in rat hepatocytes and no inhibition of the major human cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19,

The absolute configuration of the molecule was assigned by X-ray analysis of the binary complex with GSK3 and turned out to be (S) (Figure 6). The binding mode of the crystallographic structure of compound 89S in complex with GSK3 validates the modeling hypothesis formulated with the homology model of Cdc7 reported in a previous communication,19 where the binding of the nitrogen of pyridine with the hinge region was found to be the more favorable of the two possible modes. In vivo, 89S proved to be efficacious in the human ovarian A2780 xenograft mouse model and in the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced rat tumor model. In the A2780 xenograft model (Figure 7), tested orally at 60 mg/kg twice a day for 10 days, the compound showed 68% tumor growth inhibition. This dose is potentially very close to the maximal tolerated dose as the mice experienced severe, although reversible, body weight loss. With the aim of providing a quantitative estimate of the in vivo potency, a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic approach, based on a previously published model,32 was applied to the efficacy data. This method, linking the pharmacokinetics of the compound to the effect on the growth curves, provides two model parameters: Ct and K2 (Table 12). The former (Ct) provides an estimate of the steady-state drug concentration in plasma above which tumor mass reduction and eventually

eradication are observed, the latter (K2) can be regarded as a drug specific measurement of the potency of the compound. Both model parameters indicate a good in vivo potency of 89S. The estimated Ct value in the A2780 xenograft model was 1.93 µmol/L and the potency K2 was 0.0059 h/µmol/L. As a comparison, the same parameters for a well-known antitumor drug like Paclitaxel are 0.545 µmol/L and 0.022 h/µmol/L, respectively.32 In the DMBA tumor model, 89S was tested at a dose of 20 mg/kg, oral, twice a day for 10 days. As displayed in Figure 8, durable tumor stabilization is reached. Thus, 89S appears to have a greater antitumor activity than compound 1,21 both in the A2780 ovary carcinoma xenograft (68% vs 50% tumor growth inhibition) and in the DMBA tumor model, where tumor stabilization is maintained for a longer period of time (35 vs 25 days). To correlate antitumor activity with Cdc7 inhibition, A2780 tumors, explanted from controls or animals treated with two administrations (60 mg/kg each) of 89S in 6 h (second administration 3 h after the first one), were analyzed by Western blot (Figure 9). We observed that phosphorylation of Mcm2 at the Cdc7 dependent sites Ser40 and Ser53 was greatly decreased in the tumors of treated animals consistent with inhibition of Cdc7 in the tumor cells. Conclusions Pyrrolopyridinones have been shown to be potent inhibitors of the Cdc7 kinase. Our investigation of the SAR of this series of compounds has identified the key components necessary for kinase inhibition. Optimization efforts led to (S)-2-(2-aminopyrimidin-4-yl)-7-(2-fluoro-ethyl)-1,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2c]pyridin-4-one (89S), which showed a number of desirable

features for the purpose of cancer drug development, including biochemical potency against its main target, acceptable selectivity against a panel of unrelated kinases, as well as good potency in proliferation and in cell-based mechanistic assays. Compound 89S displayed good bioavailability across multiple species, resulting in plasma exposures sufficient to achieve good antitumor activity in two different species. Altogether, these characteristics make 89S a significantly improved derivative with respect to the starting parent compound 1. However, 89S, like 1 and many other compounds in this class, is rapidly cleared from plasma. Defining the mechanisms for plasma clearance and being able to limit it will be a critical challenge for developing a Cdc7 kinase inhibitor from this class that is suitable for human administration. Experimental Section 1. Chemistry. Unless otherwise noted, all solvents and reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. All reactions involving air- or moisture-sensitive reagents were performed under an argon atmosphere. All final compounds were purified to >95% purity as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Purity was routinely measured by HPLC on a Waters X Terra RP 18 (4.6 mm × 50 mm, 3.5 µm) column using a Waters 2790 HPLC system equipped with a 996 Waters PDA detector and Micromass model A ZQ single quadrupole mass spectrometer, equipped with an electrospray (ESI) ion source. Mobile phase A was an ammonium acetate 5 mM buffer (pH 5.5 with acetic acid/ acetonitrile 95:5), and mobile phase B was H2O/acetonitrile (5: 95). The following conditions were used: a gradient from 10 to 90% B in 8 min and held at 90% B for 2 min; UV detection at 220 and 254 nm; a flow rate of 1 mL/min; an injection volume of 10 µL; full scan, mass range from 100 to 800 amu. The capillary voltage was 2.5 kV; the source temperature was 120 °C; the cone was 10 V. Retention times (HPLC rt) are given in minutes at 220 or at 254 nm. Masses are given as an m/z ratio. When necessary, compounds were purified by preparative HPLC on a Waters Symmetry C18 (19 mm × 50 mm, 5 µm) column using a Waters preparative HPLC 600 equipped with a 996 Waters PDA detector and a Micromass model A ZMD single quadrupole mass spectrometer, with electrospray ionization, in the positive mode, was used. Mobile phase A was water and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. The following conditions were used: a gradient from 10 to 90% B in 8 min and held at 90% B for 2 min; a flow rate 20 mL/min. Column chromatography was conducted either under medium pressure on silica (Merck silica gel 40-63 µm) or on prepacked silica gel cartridges (Biotage) or on a Horizon system. 1 H NMR spectra were routinely recorded on a Varian Inova 400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz and equipped with a 5 mm indirect detection PFG probe, (1H{15N-31P}). Where reported, a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer, operating at 500 MHz and equipped with a 5 mm triple resonance PFG probe, (1H{15N-31P}) or a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer, operating at 300 MHz and equipped with a 5 mm switchable probe (15N-31P{1H,19F}) was used. All observed protons are reported as parts per million (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane (TMS) or other internal reference in the appropriate solvent indicated.

Crystallographic Methods. Full-length GSK3 was produced as previously described.34 Crystals of 89S in complex with GSK3 grew at 20 °C against a reservoir containing 20% PEG 3350, Hepes pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. 89S was dissolved in 20% DMSO, 35% PEG 400, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.0, and added at a final concentration of 1 mM to the protein sample. Hanging drops were made by mixing 1 µL of sample with 1 µL of reservoir solution and crystals appeared within one week. Subsequently, larger crystals were obtained via the microseeding method, setting up drops made of 1 µL protein sample, 0.8 µL reservoir solution, and 0.2 µL seed stock. Next, a single crystal was soaked for 20 min in

10 µL of a cryoprotecting solution containing 18% PEG 3350, 25% glycerol, and 20 mM MgCl2 before being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data at 2.2 Å resolution were collected at the ESRF on beamline ID23-1. The crystal belongs to space group P212121, and two molecules are present in the asymmetric unit (AU). The initial 2mFo-DFc electron density map prior to the addition of the inhibitor's model clearly showed its binding mode. Moreover, inspection of the electron density after a few cycles of model building/refinement allowed us to unambiguously determine the S configuration of compound 89S. One point worth mentioning is that, although the electron density is clearly defined, for the majority of the inhibitor, it is somewhat poor for the inhibitor's fluorine atom in both molecules of the AU. Tight NCS restraints were used in Refmac and released at the end of refinement (the atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 3DU8). The final model has an R factor of 21.3% and an Rfree of 24.6%. 4. Kinase Assays. Kinase assays were performed as previously described.19 5. High-Throughput Solubility. Solubility at pH 7 was performed as previously described.35 6. Cell Permeability. Caco2 and PAMPA cell permeability assays were performed as previously described.36 7. Metabolic Stability. The compound was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM concentration. Human cDNA expressed cytochrome P450 isoforms (supersomes) were purchased from Gentest (Woburn, MA). Human cytochrome b5 was purchased from PanVera (Madison, WI). All chemicals used were of analytical grade and commercially available. The potential inhibitory effect was investigated against cDNA expressed human CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 supersomes using typical substrates incubated at their respective Km concentration. A known inhibitor was included for each CYP isoform to check the inhibition response. These were furafylline, quercetin, sulfaphenazole, tranylcypromine, quinidine, and ketoconazole for CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, respectively. Analysis of both substrate and metabolite was done by LC/MS-MS. 8. Plasma Protein Binding. Plasma protein binding was performed as previously described.35 9. In Vivo Pharmacokinetics. Nu/Nu Mouse. The pharmacokinetic profile of the compounds was investigated in overnight fasted male Nu/Nu mice following a single dose given intravenously (iv) or orally (po). The vehicle used was 5% dextrose solution. A total of six mice were treated (three for each leg). Blood samples of each mouse were collected from the saphenous vein at predose, 0.083, 0.5, 1, 6, and 24 h postdosing following iv dosing, and at predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 6, and 24 h following oral dosing.

CdI Nu/Nu 3 female mice from Charles River Italy, six weeks old, weighing 21-30 g, were treated for 10 days at the dose of 30 mg/kg twice a day. After the last treatment, blood samples were taken at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 24 h postdosing. Samples were centrifuged at 10000g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the plasma was stored at -80 °C until analysis. Samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS technique. Han-Wistar Rat.

for 3 min at 4 °C, and the plasma was stored at -80 °C until analysis. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS technique. Beagle Dog. The pharmacokinetic profile of the compound was investigated in overnight fasted male and female Beagle dogs (2/ sex). The two treatments (iv and po) were given at the same animals 2-weeks apart. The vehicle used was 5% dextrose solution. Blood samples of each dog were collected from the jugular vein at the following times: predose, 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h postdosing following iv dosing and at predose 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h following oral dosing. Urine samples were collected after the following time intervals: 0-8, 8-24, 24-48 h. Plasma samples were centrifuged at 10000g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the plasma was stored at -80 °C until analysis. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS technique. Pharmacokinetic Noncompartmental Data Analysis. The pharmacokinetic parameters were derived by noncompartmental methods using the WinNonlin software program. The highest concentration Cmax and the time to peak tmax were read as the coordinates of the highest observed concentration. The terminal half-life time (t1/2,z) was calculated by the formula t1/2,z ) ln(2)/z, where z is the slope of the terminal linear phase of natural-log concentrations vs time curve. The choice of the points on the terminal phase was based on visual inspection of the data. The area under the plasma level vs time curve, AUC, was calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule up to the last detectable concentration C(tz) and beyond that time by extrapolation from C(tz) assuming monoexponential decay, using the following formula: AUC ) AUC(0 - tz) + C(tz)/z. The following formulas were applied for the estimate of plasma clearance (CL) and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss). CL ) dose/AUC; MRT ) AUMC/AUC; Vss ) CL · MRT; AUMC ) AUMC(0 - tz) + C(tz) · tz/z + C(tz)/z2, with AUMC(0 - tz) calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule on C · t vs t plots. The oral bioavailability (expressed as percent) was estimated by the ratio of dose-normalized AUC values after oral and iv dose. Renal clearance was evaluated as: Ae/AUCt, where Ae was the amount of compound excreted unchanged in urine within the scheduled time collection (rat: 0-24 h; dog: 0-48 h).

Pharmacokinetic data for the PK/PD modeling were modeled using a monocompartment with a first-order absorption (k10) and first-order elimination (K01) with the aid of WinNonlin software program. 10. Antiproliferative Assay. HeLa cells (European collection of cell culture) and MCF7 (European collection of cell culture) were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with heat inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). HCT116 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and HT29 (European Collection of Cell Culture) were maintained in McCoy's medium with 10% FCS. SW403 (DSMZ, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) were maintained in DMEM medium with 10% FCS. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) were maintained in fibroblast basal medium supplemented with growth factors and with 10% FCS. A2780 (European Collection of Cell Culture), COLO205, SW48, NCI-H929 (American Type Culture Collection), and L-363, OPM2 (DSMZ, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures), were grown in RPMI1640 10% FCS. Cells were seeded at different densities ranging from 2500 to 5000 cells/well in 96 well black plates (Perkin-Elmer) with the appropriate complete medium. After 24 h, plates were treated with compounds and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. At the end of incubation, cells were lysed and the ATP content in the well, used as a measure of viable cells, was determined using a thermostable firefly luciferase-based assay (CellTiter-Glo) from Promega. IC50 values were calculated using percent of growth versus untreated control. 11. Inhibition of Cell Proliferation. Inhibition of cell proliferation was performed as previously described.19 12. Cell Cycle Analysis and BrdU Determination. All the cells in the plates including cells floating in the medium and released during PBS washes were collected and analyzed. Adherent cells

were released from the plastic by mild treatment with trypsin and added to the tubes. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS. For FACS analysis, cells were suspended in PBS containing RNase A (2 µg/mL) and propidium iodide (5 µg/mL) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For BrdU staining cells were incubated with 50 µM BrdU, washed in PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS. DNA was denatured with 2N HCl for 20 min, and cells were then blocked in buffer containing 1% FCS, 0.5% Tween20 in PBS and finally incubated with FITC anti-BrdU antibody (Becton Dickinson) diluted 1:5 in the blocking buffer. Samples were analyzed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). 13. Western Blot Analysis. For Western blot analysis, cell extracts were prepared in a buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, and 1 mmol/L DTT and were sonicated for 10 s. Then 15 µg of protein extract determined by TCA assay was loaded in each lane; anti-MCM2 was from Abcam; anti-caspase3 and anti Rb (pS807/811) were from Cell Signaling; anti-Cdc6 was from Neomarker; anti-pSer53 MCM2 and anti-pSer40/41 MCM2 were previously described.13 14. Evaluation of Antitumor Efficacy. CdI Nu/Nu female mice from Charles River Italy, six weeks old, weighing 21-30 g, were maintained in cages with paper filter covers, food, sterilized bedding, and acidified water. A2780 human ovarian carcinoma (from American Type Culture Collection) was maintained by subcutaneous (sc) transplantation in athymic mice using 20-30 mg of tumor brei. For the experiment, tumors were excised and fragments were implanted sc into the left flank. The treatments started when the tumors were measurable; mean tumor weight for all the groups was 0.185 g and 89S was dissolved in glucose solution. Treatments were administered orally twice a day for 10 days. In the control group, animals were treated with the vehicle twice a day. The tumor growth was evaluated every 3 days. Tumor dimension was regularly measured by calipers during the experiments, and the tumor mass, as well as the PK/PD model parameters, were calculated as described.37 The tumor growth inhibition (TGI, %) was calculated according to the equation: %TGI ) 100 - (mean tumor weight of treated group/mean tumor weight of control group) × 100. Toxicity was evaluated on the basis of the body weight reduction. Mice were sacrificed when the tumors reached a volume that hampered them, and the gross autopsy findings were reported. 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and its vehicle sesame oil were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Female CD OFA rats, from Charles River Italy, were intubated with a single intragastric dose of 20 mg of DMBA in 1.0 mL of sesame oil. After approximately 50 days, animals were examined by palpation. When at least one mammary tumor measuring 1 cm in diameter was identified, the rats were placed sequentially into two groups and treated orally, twice a day, for 10 days with 20 mg/kg of 89S, dissolved in glucose solution or its vehicle. Each group included 10 animals and the volume of Y (control group) or Z (treated group) primary tumors was measured using Vernier calipers for the duration of the experiment.
