The family 10 xylanase from Streptomyces olivaceoviridis E-86 contains a (b/a)8-barrel as a catalytic domain, a family 13 carbohydrate binding module (CBM) as a xylan binding domain (XBD) and a Gly/Pro-rich linker between them. The crystal structure of this enzyme showed that XBD has three similar subdomains, as indicated by the presence of a triple-repeated sequence, forming a galactose binding lectin fold similar to that found in the ricin toxin B-chain. Comparison with the structure of ricin/lactose complex suggests three potential sugar binding sites in XBD. In order to understand how XBD binds to the xylan chain, we analyzed the sugar-complex structure by the soaking experiment method using the xylooligosaccharides and other sugars. In the catalytic cleft, bound sugars were observed in the xylobiose and xylotriose complex structures. In the XBD, bound sugars were identi®ed in subdomains a and g in all of the complexes with xylose, xylobiose, xylotriose, glucose, galactose and lactose. XBD binds xylose or xylooligosaccharides at the same sugar binding sites as in the case of the ricin/lactose complex but its binding manner for xylose and xylooligosaccharides is different from the galactose binding mode in ricin, even though XBD binds galactose in the same manner as in the ricin/galactose complex. These different binding modes are utilized ef®ciently and differently to bind the long substrate to xylanase and ricin-type lectin. XBD can bind any xylose in the xylan backbone, whereas ricin-type lectin recognizes the terminal galactose to sandwich the large sugar chain, even though the two domains have the same family 13 CBM structure. Family 13 CBM has rather loose and broad sugar speci®cities and is used by some kinds of proteins to bind their target sugars. In such enzyme, XBD binds xylan, and the catalytic domain may assume a ¯exible position with respect to the XBD/xylan complex, inasmuch as the linker region is unstructured.

Introduction
Endo-1,4-b-D-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) hydrolyzes b-1,4-glycosidic bonds within the xylan backbone, producing the b-anomeric xylooligosaccharides. Xylan is a major component of hemicelluloses in plant cell walls. Based on the amino acid sequence of their catalytic domains, xylanases have been classi®ed mainly into two glycoside hydrolase families, 10 and 11.1 Initial crystallographic studies of family 10 xylanases showed that the catalytic

66 domain comprises of an eight-fold (b/a)8-barrel, whose catalytic cleft runs through the surface at the C-terminal side of the central b-barrel.2 ± 4 The catalytic mechanism of family 10 xylanases is believed to involve a double displacement general acid-base reaction in which two glutamic acid residues act as the nucleophile and acid-base.5 ± 7 Extensive subsite analyses, including mutant as well as crystallographic studies of enzyme/substrate and enzyme/substrate analogue complexes, have been conducted to better understand the active site of this enzyme.7 ± 12 Besides the catalytic domain, xylanases frequently have a substrate binding domain at the N or C-terminal end. The substrate binding domains of xylanases are often speci®c for xylan and they are therefore referred to as xylan binding domains (XBDs).13 ± 15 XBD seems to assist the catalytic process by binding the long xylan chain. In cellulases, cellulose binding domains (CBDs) are similarly found, and help the degradation of crystalline cellulose.16,17 XBD, CBD, and other sugar binding domains are now referred to as carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). CBMs constitute rather small domains, but possess various types of structures and at present they are classi®ed into more than 20 families based on amino acid sequence similarities.16,18 A xylanase from Streptomyces olivaceoviridis E-86 (FXYN: 45 kDa) has been used to produce xylobiose and xylose from commercial hardwood and its substrate speci®city has been well characterized.19 ± 23 The DNA sequence of FXYN has indicated that the enzyme consists of a catalytic domain and a substrate binding domain, with a Gly/Pro-rich linker region connecting the two domains. Based on the sequence of the catalytic domain, this enzyme belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 10.15 The XBD of FXYN has a triple-repeated sequence, similar to those of xylanase A and arabinofuranosidase B from Streptomyces lividans,24,25 and this type of XBD belongs to the CBM family 13. We have conducted some mutational studies on FXYN to investigate the properties of this enzyme. Removal of the XBD from FXYN resulted in a truncated enzyme with about half the hydrolytic activity against insoluble xylan as the wild-type FXYN.15 This suggested that XBD binds to insoluble xylan and effectively assists in the catalysis. Recently, we have determined the crystal structure of FXYN, which possesses both the catalytic domain and XBD.26 This was the ®rst X-ray analysis of a xylanase containing XBD. XBD consists of three similar repeated peptides of about 40 residues in length. Each peptide folds into a fourshort-stranded subdomain referred to as subdomains a, b, and g, and these three units assemble around the pseudo 3-fold axis, forming a globular structure. This combination of three subdomains results in a fold similar to the ``b-trefoil fold''.27 This fold is shared by some plant galactose binding lectins from Ricinus communis (ricin toxin B-chain,

RTB),28 Abrus precatorius29 and Sambucus nigra,30 in which two triple-repeated-sequence domains are arranged in tandem. CBM 13 is therefore referred to as ricin-type lectin representing various galactose binding lectins.31 Comparison of the XBD sequence of FXYN with the RTB/lactose complex structure showed that most of the residues involved in lactose binding in RTB are strictly conserved among all three subdomains of XBD, indicating that XBD could bind to lactose at the same binding sites. At the same time, these sites are the major candidates for xylan binding based on the docking model. Examination of XBD of FXYN showed that xylooligosaccharides with at least three xylose units effectively released the bound xylan from the XBD.32 Meanwhile, sugar binding characteristics of CBM 13 from S. lividans were reported which suggested that XBD binds to xylan by co-operative interactions through two of the three xylan binding sites.33 These studies showed that XBD prefers rather long substrates as the binding ligands. They also showed broad binding activity against many mono- and disaccharides. To clarify the substrate binding mode of XBD, we have conducted structural analyses of the substrate complexes of FXYN using some xylooligosaccharides, and other sugars as the binding ligands.

Results and Discussion
The FXYN crystals have adequate space around the catalytic cleft and subdomains a and g, to yield structures of sugar complexes for examination by X-ray crystallography. Overall architecture Sugar complex structures of FXYN were deterÊ mined at approximately 2.0 A resolution (Figure 1). X-ray data collections were conducted under cryoconditions for crystals of the complexes of xylose (X1), xylobiose (X2), xylotriose (X3), and glucose (Glc) and at room temperature for crystals of the complexes of lactose (Lac) and galactose (Gal). All crystals contained two non-crystallographic-symmetry (NCS)-related molecules A and B, and the root-mean-square (rms) differences between the Ê two molecules were below 1.0 A for all atoms. Crystal parameters and structural re®nement statistics are shown in Table 1. Cell parameters under cryo-condition were smaller than those at room temperature. The overall structure of FXYN in all complexes were almost identical to those of the non-complexed enzyme. The rms differences between the complexes and non-complex strucÊ tures were below 1.0 A. The model of FXYN consisted of an N-terminal 301-residue (b/a)8-barrel motif as a catalytic domain, a 123-residue ricintype lectin domain as XBD, with 11-residue Gly/ Pro-rich linker region between the two domains, owing to the cryo-condition of the experiment (Figure 1).

(304-312) in the linker region, which were missing in the previous study, were observed in the Fobs À Fcalc maps in some sugar complex structures (Figure 2). Three Pro residues at the center of the linker region formed a turn around in the solvent area. The electron densities corresponding to the soaked sugars were found in the catalytic cleft in the catalytic domain and in the sugar binding site of subdomain a and g of the XBD (Figure 1). The sugar binding site in the subdomain b was involved in the crystal packing interface between the NCS molecules, and the soaked substrate seemed incapable of reaching the binding site. As a result, electron density for the soaked sugar was not observed in subdomain b. The results of the soaking experiments are summarized in Figure 3.

Bound xylooligosaccharides in the catalytic domain The active site is positioned at the bottom of the cleft which runs along the C-terminal side of the bstrands of the (b/a)8-barrel. Subsites at the catalytic cleft of the glycoside hydrolases are usually de®ned from the cleavage site as 1, 2 . . . to the reducing end and as À1, À2 . . . to the non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide.34 The catalytic residues are the two glutamic acid residues, Glu128 acting as an acid/base catalyst and Glu236 as a nucleophile. Concerning to the NCS-related molecules (A and B), there were some differences in the assigned bound sugars maybe because of the crystal packing. But basically the sugar coordination was almost the same between the two mol-

ecules, and the descriptions hereafter refer mainly to molecule A. In the structure of FXYN/X3 complex, the xylotriose molecule was observed at subsites À1 $ À3, while only two sugar units of the xylotriose were interpreted to be present from the map at () subsites in the opposite side of the cleft (Figure 4). In the structure of FXYN/X2 complex, two xylobiose molecules were clearly recognized from the electron density map to be present at subsites À1 and À2, and subsites 1 and 2. In the structure of the FXYN/X1 complex, no clear electron density for sugar units was observed in the catalytic cleft. Structural analyses of the family 10 xylanase/ substrate complexes have been conducted in several ways.7 ± 12 The results have basically shown that amino acid residues on the (À) side of the cleft are very strongly conserved but the residues on the () side are not well conserved among family 10 xylanases. In our analysis, xylose units were observed in the electron density maps in the complexes of FXYN/X2 and FXYN/X3 in both the (À) and () sides (Figure 4). Since structural analyses of X2 and X3 complexes at room temperature and low substrate concentration showed no electron density in the () side cleft (data not shown), af®nity of the (À) side subsites to the xylooligosaccharides would be higher than the () side and the reaction product may come off easily from the () side. It was probably due to the cryo-condition that the soaked substrates could be seen in the maps in the () side. In the (À) side of the cleft, two xylose moieties occupied subsites À1 and À2 in the FXYN/X2 complex and three moieties were observed at À1 $ À 3 subsites in the FXYN/X3 complex. In

both complexes, the xylose moiety at subsite À1 hydrogen bonded to the side-chains of Glu128, Glu236, Asn127, and His81, including forming strong hydrogen bonds with the Glu128 carboxyl through the O1 atom with a coordination distance Ê of 2.5 A (Figure 4). The xylose at subsite À1 also had hydrophobic interactions by being surrounded by Trp85, Trp274 and Trp266. The xylose moiety at subsite À2 also hydrogen bonded with Glu44, Asn45, Trp266, and Lys48. The xylose unit at subsite À3, however, had no direct interaction with the protein. One ordered water molecule mediated the xylose at subsite À3 as well as the side-chains of Asp50 and Gln88 by hydrogen bonding. From the bound structure, subsite À3 seemed to have weak binding energy. While subsites À1 and À2 showed many direct interactions, including hydrophobic interactions with the three tryptophan residues, which possibly caused tight substrate binding, no clear density for xylose was observed in the catalytic cleft in the complex of FXYN/X1, even though a high X1 concentration was employed for the soaking experiment, suggesting that occupation of the two subsites À1 and À2 may be needed to recognize the substrate. In the FXYN/X2 and FXYN/X3 complexes, two xylose moieties were observed at subsites 1 and 2. Xylose at subsite 1 came slightly off the site, perhaps because of the tightly bound xylose unit at subsite À1, and had only a weak stacking interaction with Tyr172, with no direct polar inter-

action. At subsite 2, the xylose unit was hydrogen bonded to three residues, Asn209, Ser212, and Arg275. Compared to the (À) side of the cleft, residues in the () side are not conserved among family 10 xylanases.9 In FXYN, the () side of the catalytic cleft showed variation in the upper left positon of the cleft in Figure 4, especially in the vicinity of the loop region Asn209-Pro213, which protruded out to the end of the () side of the catalytic cleft compared to the other xylanases. Asn209 and Ser212 in this loop coordinate to the 2 xylose unit and the bound xylose at 2 was positioned

outside of the cleft compared to the other xylanases.11,12 Next to the subsite 2, one xylose unit was less clearly observed in molecule B in the FXYN/X3 complex, which was hydrogen bonded with Asn173 and also interacted hydrophobically with Trp179, but was absent in molecule A. The third xylose was disordered in the water region in one case and, therefore, FXYN seems to have two subsites 1 and 2 of the cleft which are not conserved as with the other xylanases and which serve as determinants of substrate speci®city for FXYN.

Beyond the 2 site, electron density for one xylose molecule was observed in molecule A of the FXYN/X1 and FXYN/X2 complexes (site R in Figure 1) , which was not observed in the FXYN/ X3 or other sugar complexes. Since there were no direct hydrogen bonds, the site R was not con-

sidered as another subsite. The distal xylose overlaid the Trp179 forming a stacking interaction and the indole ring of Trp179 took different conformations between the complex structures in cryocondition and at room temperature. This Trp may interact in part with the long xylan backbone or

side-chain sugars through its indole ring and help with substrate binding. However the R site was not reached directly by a long extended xylooligo-

saccharide from the bound X2 in the () subsite in the FXYN/X2 complex, because of the extended loop of Asn209-Ser212.

72 Plant xylan is usually found as an arabinoglucuronoxylan, which has arabinose and glucuronic acid as branched sugar side-chains, where an arabinofuranosyl residue (A) is attached to the O3 atom of the xylose by the a-1,3 linkage and a glucuronosyl residue (GlcUA) or 4-O-methyl-glucuronosyl residue (MeGlcUA) is linked to the O2 atom by the a1,2 linkage. Substrate speci®city of FXYN toward the arabinoglucuronoxylan was investigated previously,20,35,36 and FXYN produced mainly four kinds of hetero-oligosaccharides, 3.2-a-L-arabinofuranosyl-xylobiose (A-X-X), 32-a-L-arabinofuranosylxylotriose (X-(A)X-X), 23-a-D-glucuronosylxylotriose (GlcUA-X-X-X) and 23-4-O-methyl-a-D-glucuronosylxylotriose (MeGlcUA-X-X-X). These products indicated the site speci®cites of FXYN, and the recognition mechanism of the sugar sidechain of FXYN would be elucidated by the result of FXYN/X3 complex (Figure 4(b)). The O2 and O3 hydroxyl atoms of the bound xylose unit at subsite À1 were buried into the cleft and could not afford to have branched residues, and this structure explains the fact that FXYN cannot hydrolyze the reducing end b-1,4-linkage of the branched xylose. FXYN cannot also hydrolyze the second b-1,4-linkage from the glucuronosyl xylose in the direction of the reducing end, but can hydrolyze in the case from the arabinofuranosyl xylose. The O2 atom of the xylose unit at subsite À2 was half surrounded by Trp266, Trp274 and Glu44 and the glucuronosyl residue might be impossible to be linked, but the O3 atom had suf®cient space to have the arabinofuranosyl side-chain. Similarly, the O2 and O3 atoms of the bound xyloses at subsites À3 and 1 oriented outward of the cleft and both arabinose and glucuronic acid could be linked to these xylose units. This is consistent with the fact that FXYN can hydrolyze both the ®rst b-1,4-linkage to the non-reducing end and the third linkage to the reducing end. Product X-(A)X-X indicated that the arabinofuranosyl residue should be attached to the O3 atoms of xyloses at subsites 2 and À2. Based on the bound structure, the O3 atom at subsite 2 was hydrogen bonded by Arg275 and seemed to be impossible to link the arabinose residue. But considering the ¯exibility of Arg275 and the b-1,4-linkage of the xylan backbone between xylose units at 1 and 2 as well as the weak binding energy of the () side cleft, the xylose molecule at subsite 2 might take a rather free position to link the side-chain through the O3 atom. Bound xylooligosaccharides in the XBD XBD can be divided into three repeated subdomains (subdomains a, b and g) of approximately 40 residues each of whose sequences and structures are homologous to each other. The mutational analyses of two of three Tyr residues showed that all the binding sites including subdomain b bound xylan or xylooligosaccharides and the binding af®nity of subdomain b was higher than other subdo-

mains (unpublished data). In the complex of FXYN/X1, electron density corresponding to one xylose unit each was observed in subdomains a and g, whereas in the complexes of FXYN/X2, and FXYN/X3, one xylose unit was observed in subdomains a, and two xylose units in subdomains g (Figures 3 and 5(a) and (b)). These xylose binding sites correspond to the galactose binding sites of RTB subdomains 1a and 2g.37 Residues involved in the galactose binding in the RTB/lactose complex, such as the conserved polar residues Asp, Gln Asn and Tyr, also participated in binding xylose. O2 and O3 atoms of the xylose were positioned in the inner part of the site, forming hydrogen bonds with the side-chains of both Asp and Asn. O4 atoms made hydrogen bonds with Gln338 in subdomain a or Glu421 in subdomain g and were at the XBD surface. Tyr340 in subdomain a and Tyr423 in subdomain g entered into stacking interactions with the xylose rings between the aromatic ring and sugar ring. There were also hydrogen bonding interactions between the O3 atom of xylose and the main-chain carbonyl of Pro327 in subdomain a or the carbonyl of Val410 in subdomain g, and between the O2 atom and the sidechain of His343 in subdomain a. In subdomain g, a water molecule mediated between the O2 atom of xylose and the side-chain oxygen of Ser426. But the xylose binding manner of XBD was different from the galactose binding manner in RTB/Lac complex as may be expected from the structure of galactose and xylose, although almost all of the residues participating in galactose binding in RTB are strictly conserved in the three subdomains of XBD. The galactose unit of the bound lactose was attached to the RTB, with the O3 and O4 atoms buried within the site and the galactose had a different sugar orientation from that of RTB. In contrast, the manner of xylose binding in subdomains a and g was almost the same. The xylose molecule was mounted above the aromatic ring of Tyr, and the O2 and O3 atoms formed the main hydrogen-bonding interaction with the XBD. The O1 and O4 atoms were exposed to the surface of the XBD and the xylan chain could be extended from this xylose unit in both directions. In the FXYN/X2 or FXYN/X3 complexes, continuous electron densities were observed on both sides of the bound xylose at the O1 and O4 atoms, and the XBD appeared to be bound precisely to the middle part of xylan. As mentioned above, the xylan binding site of subdomain b is buried in the crystal packing interface and the bound sugar could not be observed. However, subdomain b has a structure similar to that possessed by subdomains a and g and most of the xylose-coordinating residues of subdomain b were readily superimposable on those of subdomains a and g (Figure 6), indicating that it is likely to bind xylose in the same manner as subdomains a and g. As a result, all three subdomains seem to have similar xylan binding sites and to be capable of binding the xylan chain.

The O1-O4 direction of the xylose unit could not Ê be determined from the 2 A resolution electron density maps because of the highly symmetric structure of the xylose moiety. Besides the ring to ring stacking interaction with Tyr residues, C5 and O5 atoms have no polar interaction with the protein. Excluding these two atoms, xylose has a completely symmetrical structure with four equatorial hydroxyl groups, and it is dif®cult to discriminate on the basis of electron density between C5 and O5 atoms. Therefore, the determination of the probable direction of bound xylose was ®rstly guided by the bound glucose in the FXYN/Glc structure. Glucose has a non-symmetric structure with an extra hydroxymethylene group at the C5 atom of the xylose molecule, which has a clear electron density on analysis (Figure 5(c)). In the case of this binding, the O5 atom is located on the far side of the sugar ring, probably to avoid close contact with the aromatic ring. After going through the cycles of re®nement, one water molecule was assigned within the binding site g, at a distance of a hydrogen bond from the O5 atom of the bound xylose, con®rming the correct direction of the sugar ring. However, binding of xylan in the reverse direction cannot be excluded if the aim is to bind the substrate by any means. When XBD binds xylose, the O2 and O3 atoms of xylose point into the protein, suggesting that the binding sites cannot accommodate the side-chain branched xylose. However, based on the xylobiose bound structure (Figure 5(b)), the O2 and O3 atoms of the adjacent xylose point outward from the protein, enabling it to link side-chain substitutions. The same situation prevails on the opposite side and consequently XBD could bind the branched insoluble xylan chain, even though it cannot recognize the branched xylose.

Bound lactose, galactose and glucose in the XBD The manner in which galactose was bound was determined from analyses of the FXYN/Gal and FXYN/Lac complexes. In the FXYN/Gal complex, an electron density corresponding to only one galactose unit was observed at the xylan binding site of subdomains a and g (Figures 3 and 5(d)). The manner of galactose binding was different from that of xylose binding in the FXYN/X1 complex, but similar to that of galactose binding in the RTB/Lac complex. In the subdomain a, O3 and O4 atoms of the galactose molecule were positioned in the inner part of the site, hydrogen bonded to the side-chain of Asp325. The O3 atom had two more hydrogen bonds to the side-chains of His343 and Asn347. The O4 atom hydrogen bonded to the side-chain of Gln338 and the main-chain carbonyl of Asn328. The galactose ring assumed a chair conformation and a part of the sugar ring, C3-C4-C5, faced the aromatic ring of Tyr340, where they formed partial stacking interactions. XBD bound galactose in the same manner in subdomain g. In the FXYN/Lac complex, an electron density corresponding to only one galactose unit of the lactose was clearly observed at subdomains a and g of the XBD (Figure 5(e) and (f)), and the manner of galactose binding was different between the two subdomains. In the FXYN/Lac complex, the position and binding mode of the galactose unit in subdomain a were almost the same as those of the galactose moiety in the FXYN/Gal complex (Figure 5(d) and (f)), but in subdomain g they were almost the same as those of xylose in the FXYN/X1 complex (Figure 5(b) and (e)). More speci®cally, in subdomain g, XBD binds to galactose in two different ways. These differences in binding manner may be due to crystal packing where a molecule occupies an adjacent space for the glucose unit of lactose in

74 subdomain g when the lactose molecule binds perpendicularly to the XBD surface, as in subdomain a. In the crystal, lactose may be docked when lactose binds tangentially along the XBD surface. In the solution, however, the sugar binding site of subdomain g had suf®cient space and lactose could bind to subdomain g of the XBD in the same manner as in subdomain a. These experiments demonstrated that XBD can still bind to galactose as in the case of the galactose binding lectin, although the enzyme utilizes XBD to bind xylan or xylooligosaccharides. The xylan binding site itself seems to have rather loose speci®city against the sugars, since XBD can bind many kinds of sugars, and as well as galactose in two different manners. A continuous electron density from the O1 atom of the galactose moiety was found in both subdomains, particularly in subdomain g, which may correspond to the C4 atom of glucose of the glycosyl linkage (Figure 5(f)), indicating that the bound sugar was lactose, but a glucose unit might be ¯exibly oriented against XBD in the crystal. In the RTB/Lac complex, both the galactose and glucose units were observed in the electron density map, whereas only the galactose moiety was clearly observed in the FXYN/Lac complex. Orientation of the galactose in subdomain a of FYYN and RTB was the same, and the coordinating residues to galactose were almost the same. One of the differences in the manner of binding was that, in subdomain 1a of the RTB, Asn328 of XBD was replaced by Asp25, which interacted with the O3 atom of the glucose unit of lactose. But, the speci®city for lactose in both proteins may be due to subtle differences caused by the surrounding residues. Even though XBD binds to xylose and galactose in different ways, there are common features in their sugar coordination. In the FXYN/Gal complex, carboxylate of Asp325 hydrogen bonds with O3 and O4 atoms of the galactose moiety, whereas in FXYN/X1, FXYN/X2 and FXYN/X3 it coordinates with O2 and O3 atoms of the xylose. In these complexes, the structures of O3-C3-C4-O4 of galac-

tose and O2-C2-C3-O3 of xylose are well localized in the same position (Figure 7). The different orientation of the sugar ring was caused by superposition of the O2 and O3 atoms of xylose onto the O3 and O4 atoms of galactose. Why galactose binds differently from glucose or xylose, therefore, might be because the axial C-4 hydroxyl group forms stronger hydrogen bonds with the protein, while the equatorial orientation of the C-4 hydroxyl group of xylose or glucose cannot accommodate the protein. In XBD, Asp325 in the subdomain a and Asp408 in the subdomain g and their surrounding residues appear to play important roles in controlling the mode of binding while the Tyr aromatic rings hold part of the sugars. In general, the aromatic residues contribute to the tight sugar binding to the protein. But in the case of this particular XBD, the Tyr ring does not completely regulate the position of the sugars, which allows for the broad speci®city of binding seen against the sugars. When XBD binds to xylose, O1 and O4 atoms are positioned at the side of the binding pocket, such that the adjacent xylose units are linked by the b-1,4-glycosyl bond, thereby permitting binding to the long xylan chain (Figure 8). On the other hand, when XBD binds to galactose, the O1 atom of the galactose protrudes outwards. As a result, it can bind to the sugar chain in which galactose is linked to the other sugars through the O1 atom as in lactose, but not through the O4 atom. In this binding mode, the RTB binds to the terminal galactose or galactose derivative of the sugar chains at the cell surface, as does the galactose binding lectin. In the FXYN/Glc complex, the glucose was bound to subdomains a and g of the XBD and the sugar ring had the same orientation as the xylose molecule in the FXYN/xylose complex (Figure 5(c)). The hydroxylmethylene group of the glucose unit, which is lacking in xylose, had no interaction or con¯ict with the XBD. No electron

75 roles, binding and orienting the substrate properly for catalysis. The catalytic and substrate binding domains were in close contact and the sugar binding sites of the CBD were placed in line with the linear catalytic cleft so that the cellulose chain could extend linearly from the cellulose binding domain to the catalytic site. While in the present study, XBD of FXYN can indeed bind to the substrate, XBD does not seem to enter into a tight multi-domain interaction to provide the substrate to the catalytic domain directly, although XBD and the catalytic domain contact each other with some of the polar and hydrophobic interactions occurring in the crystal.26 Figure 9(a) shows a xyloheptaose-docking model for three sugar binding sites of the XBD. The xyloheptaose model was constructed to have a typical 3-fold screw helix and be superimposable on the bound xylose in the binding sites a and g at the center, and a docking model was similarly modeled for subdomain b. None of the straight xylan chain pointed toward the catalytic cleft from the xylan binding site. Although the xylan backbone has a rather ¯exible linkage and may lie over the two domains, the linker region may also play an important role in effecting catalysis, since it, too, seems to have a ¯exible structure judging from the electron density map and is not visible unless under cryo-condition. When XBD binds to xylan, the catalytic domain could assume a ¯exible position with respect to the XBD/xylan complex, as the linker region is unstructured. In this mode, the enzyme can degrade at whichever site the XBD binds substrate. Assuming that the role of XBD is only to bind substrate and not to direct the substrate into the active site of the

density attribute to glucose was observed in the catalytic cleft or in any other location of the FXYN. Binding against insoluble xylan Carbohydrate binding modules as in XBD and CBD usually help catalysis of a long substrate. The structure of the cellulase E4 from Thermomonospora fusca, containing both the catalytic domain of the glycosyl hydrolase family 9 and CBD of the CBM family 3, shows the consolidated nature of multidomain function.38 In this case, the CBD has two

76 enzyme, the virtue of having the three binding sites in XBD would increase the probability of the catalytic domain binding the substrate and thus effecting hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds. A ¯exible linker between domains is usually easy to be attacked by proteases. In this enzyme, three Pro residues at the center of the linker region make a round turn, which may help protect against protease degradation. The present study shows that the xylan binding sites recognize mainly only one xylose moiety with polar and Tyr stacking interactions. Although two xylose units of the xylotriose are identi®ed in the subdomain g in the FXYN/X3 complex, no special contact was observed between XBD and distal xylose unit from the binding site. However, our previous report showed that a polymer longer than xylotriose more effectively replaced the bound insoluble xylan from the XBD.32 This suggested that a neighboring xylose around the binding site might also have some interaction with the protein. His343 or Trp383, which are located around the binding sites, are good candidates for stacking interactions with xylan, as are other amino acid residues which might make contact to support the xylan chain. Especially, subdomain b has two aromatic rings of Tyr380 and Trp383 at the site, and seems to have the twist stacking structure to bind the xylan molecule, as seen in other CBMs.39 Sugar binding characteristics of CBM 13 from S. lividans, which are highly similar to those of XBD of FXYN, have been shown to have individual xylan binding sites with relatively low af®nities of 103 to 105 MÀ1 and the XBD seemed to bind xylan by cooperative interactions employing two of three xylan binding sites.33 A long substrate, which can occupy two xylan binding sites at the same time, could not be used in the soaking experiment, since the space around the enzyme molecule was limited, and the enzyme degraded the substrate in the crystal drop. Based on the results depicted in Figure 9(b) and (c), no xylan chain passed straight from one xylan binding site toward an adjacent site. In order to connect the xylan chain from site g to a, xylan needs to bend along the upper side of the XBD shown in Figure 9(b). Flexibility around the glycoside linkage of xylan due to a lack of the C-5 hydroxymethylene group would help in the formation of the bent conformation. In this case, the direction of the xylan at subdomain g would have to be reversed and concomitantly the manner in which xylan binding takes place would have to be reversed or take on other docking mode at the binding site g compared to subdomain a. As mentioned above, the mechanism involved in sugar recognition is rather loose, as is also seen in the case of galactose binding, which presumably enables XBD to bind xylan at multiple binding sites. The three xylan binding sites seem to permit the enzyme to bind different xylan chains at the same time, which also makes for effective substrate binding in the presence of an insoluble xylan clus-

ter. RTB has two galactose binding sites at subdomain 1a and 2g, which are located on different btrefoil domains and bind to larger galactooligosaccharides using two sites, thereby achieving high af®nity.37 Although FXYN has only one XBD, XBD has three xylan binding sites, probably to allow for multi-site recognition as in the case of the lectin stratagem. On the other hand, the low af®nity of the individual binding sites indicates that XBD is able to release bound xylan or xylooligosaccharide relatively easily. Since the catalytic domain still has about half the activity against insoluble xylan, FXYN does not necessarily need XBD to hold on to the substrate for catalysis. FXYN only needs XBD just for the ef®cient catalysis of insoluble xylan. From this point of view, even though xylan binding sites have low af®nity, the enzyme should work well as long as XBD is associated with a catalytic domain and turns over the substrate by rapidly binding and releasing the substrate using the three binding sites. But XBD actually has a preference for binding the longer xylan and XBD may carry out a partial turnover of substrate wherein XBD keeps binding the substrate of insoluble xylan and releasing the shorter xylooligosaccharides. Still, XBD may choose to bind insoluble xylan possibly by a multi-recognition process involving the triple low af®nity binding sites. In conclusion, a study of complex sugar structures has revealed some details of the manner by which sugar binding by XBD and hydrolysis by the catalytic domain take place in FXYN. XBD, which belongs to the CBM family 13, binds xylose or xylooligosaccharides at its three xylan binding sites differently from the binding of galactose to XBD or ricin-type lectin, but this mode of binding is effectively used by xylanase to bind the long substrate.

Material and Methods
Crystallization and data collection Recombinant full-length enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and puri®ed by a modi®ed method.15 Crystallization procedures have been reported previously.40 The enzyme was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature using a 20 mg/ml protein solution and a reservoir solution composed of 25 or 27.5 % (w/v) ammonium sulfate and 2 % McIlvaine buffer (a mixture of 0.1 M citric acid and 0.2 M Na2HPO4, pH 5.7). After a week, rod-like crystals grew more than 1 mm long. Xylose, lactose, galactose and glucose were purchased from WAKO Chemicals, Osaka, Japan and the other xylooligosaccharides were purchased from Megazyme. X1, X2, X3, galactose and lactose complex crystals were prepared by means of soaking experiments. Lactose and galactose were dissolved into the reservoir solution at a concentration of 20 mg/ml and the crystals were soaked into the substrate solution. In the case of cryo-condition analysis, X1, X2, X3, and glucose were dissolved at the concentration of 30 % in the reservoir solution and used as cryo-protectant, then ¯ash-frozen under a 100 K nitro-

Family 10 Xylanase with Family 13 CBM gen stream. Diffraction experiments were conducted on a RIGAKU imaging-plate diffractometer RAXIS IV. Ê All crystals diffracted to approximately 2.0 A resolution. The collected data sets were processed and scaled using the programs CRYSTALCLEAR (RIGAKU). All the crystals belonged to orthorhombic space group P212121 and contained two molecules in an asymmetric unit (molecules A and B). Structure determination The structural analysis was started with the noncomplexed FXYN structure26 (PDB accession code 1xyf) as the initial model and the rigid-body re®nement was performed against the complex data using the program CNS,41 resulting in appropriate structure models. The resultant Fobs À Fcalc or 2Fobs À Fcalc maps yielded the electron density corresponding to the soaked substrate. Sugar models were added into the model and successive manual model rebuilding was conducted with the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The model was then re®ned by simulated annealing, using the parameters of Engh & Huber,42 gradually adding water molecules. 5 % of the observed re¯ections were randomly removed for the cross-validation.43 The NCS constraint was not used in the re®nement cycles. The stereochemistry of the models was analyzed with programs PROCHECK44 and WHATCHECK45 and rms deviations resulted in the proper values (Table 1). Protein Data Bank accession number The coordinates for FXYN/substrate complex were deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The accession codes are 1ISV, 1ISW, 1TSX, 1ISY, 1ISZ and 1ITO for FXYN/X1, FXYN/X2, FXYN/X3, FXYN/Glc, FXYN/Gal and FXYN/Lac complexes, respectively.
