Abstract--The SAR of a series of potent sulfonamide hydroxamate TACE inhibitors, all bearing a butynyloxy P10 group, was explored. In particular, compound 5j has excellent in vitro potency against isolated TACE enzyme and in cells, good selectivity over MMP-1 and MMP-9, and oral activity in an in vivo model of TNF-a production and a collagen-induced arthritis model. # 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Small molecule mediators of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) levels are sought after agents for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease.1 EnbrelTM, a soluble TNF receptor-Fc dimer, modulates TNF-a by interacting with both the 26 kDa membrane-bound form of TNF-a and 17 kDa soluble TNF-a and is a highly effective RA therapy.2 However, EnbrelTM must be parenterally dosed and an orally bioavailable agent would therefore be highly desirable. An alternative paradigm for affecting TNF-a levels is via the inhibition of TNF-a converting enzyme (TACE/ ADAM-17), the enzyme primarily responsible for the shedding of membrane-bound TNF-a to provide its soluble form.3 A number of small molecule TACE inhibitors possessing excellent enzyme and cellular potency have recently been disclosed (Fig. 1).4À7 Some of these are selective for TACE over most MMPs (e.g., 1, IK6824), others are broad-spectrum inhibitors of TACE and MMPs (e.g., 2, SDZ 242­4845) and some display selectivity over MMP-1 (e.g., 36 and 47). Since a variety of MMPs have been found to be over-expressed in RA

synovial tissue and have been implicated in the destruction of cartilage in RA joints the optimal MMP/TACE selectivity profile for a drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis is at present unresolved.8 We have previously disclosed a series of anthranilic acid based sulfonamide hydroxamic acid TACE inhibitors bearing novel propargylic P10 groups, exemplified by compound 4.7 A number of these propargyl ethers are excellent inhibitors of TACE in a cell-free enzyme assay and also potently inhibit the LPS-induced release of

soluble TNF in THP-1 cells. Selectivity for TACE over MMP-1 and potent inhibitory activity in an in vivo model of TNF-a production has also been demonstrated. We now disclose the extension of the use of the butynyloxy P10 group to a series of sulfonamide hydroxamates, 5, derived from acyclic amino acids (Fig. 2). Sulfonamide hydroxamic acids 5a­i (Table 1) were prepared as shown in Scheme 1. Thus, 4-butynyloxybenzene sulfonyl chloride, 6, was readily available from the reaction of 1-bromo-2-butyne with 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, followed by treatment with oxalyl chloride. Sulfonylation of various amino-esters with 6 gave sulfonamides 7 in good yield. These N-H sulfonamides could then be converted into the corresponding hydroxamates, or first N-alkylated to afford 8 followed by hydroxamate formation. The cysteine and penicillamine derivatives 5k­n resulted from initial S-alkylation of the amino acids, and subsequent sulfonylation and hydroxamate formation according to Scheme 1. Derivative 5o was available by appending a Boc protected N-methyl ethanolamine sidechain on Fmoc protected 4-hydroxyphenylglycine methyl ester via Mitsunobu reaction prior to Fmoc removal and sulfonylation with 6. Compound 5p required sulfonylation of TBS-protected 4-hydroxyphenylglycine methyl ester, followed by N-methylation of the sulfonamide, desilylation and functionalization of the phenol. Alternatively, N-H sulfonamides, including 5j, could be obtained via solid phase synthesis. Coupling of Fmoc protected amino acids with a hydroxylamine-linked resin9 followed by

removal of the Fmoc, sulfonylation with 6 and cleavage of the linker with TFA gave the desired hydroxamates 5. Variants of the butynyloxy P10 group were available from glycine according to the routes described in Scheme 2. Initial formation of 4-fluorophenylsulfonamide 9a was followed by formation of the t-butyl ester and alkylation of the sulfonamide to give 10a. Displacement of the fluorine with propargylamine led to 11a, while reaction with potassium ethyl xanthate and reduction of the resulting disulfide, followed immediately by S-alkylation with 1-bromo-2-butyne, led to 11b. Conversion of 11a­b into hydroxamates 12a­b proceeded via the acids, with HOBT/EDC and hydroxylamine. Nitrile analogue 12c resulted from a Heck coupling of 4-bromophenylsulfonamide 10b with acrylonitrile and subsequent hydrogenation to give intermediate 11c, followed by hydroxamate formation. b-Amino acid derivatives 13a­b were prepared by sulfonylation of b-alanine t-butyl ester and subsequent conversion into the desired NH- or N-methyl sulfonamide hydroxamates similarly to Scheme 1.

S30 channel of TACE is confirmed by the X-ray structure of 5d (Fig. 3). A potential polar interaction between the sulfonamide NH of 5d, and its analogues, and the backbone carbonyl of an active-site proline residue in both MMP-1 and TACE may serve to reduce the conformational entropy of these ligands. This would adversely affect the ability of the butynyl moiety of the NH-sulfonamides to fit in the S10 pocket of MMP-1, and effectively increase selectivity for TACE over MMP-1. The difference in selectivity between the NH and N-methyl sulfonamide series might then be rationalized by the observation, through NMR analysis, of multiple binding conformers of compound 5g bound to MMP-1.13

All of the sulfonamide hydroxamic acids were tested in vitro10 for their ability to inhibit MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-13 and TACE.11 The inhibition of these enzymes may help prevent cartilage degradation in RA, and therefore be therapeutically desirable.8 However, inhibitors of TACE with various MMP inhibition profiles were also sought in order to gain insight into the possible source of musculoskeletal side effects seen in clinical trials of some broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors.12 The in vitro potencies for a series of acyclic sulfonamide hydroxamic acid analogues bearing butynyl P10 groups are shown in Table 1. All of the a-amino acids used to prepare the sulfonamide hydroxamates in Table 1 afforded potent inhibitors of TACE enzyme in a cell-free assay. The d-aamino acids were generally greater than 50-fold more potent than the analogous l-a-amino acid derivatives (not shown). For each series the NH-sulfonamides (5a, 5d, 5f, 5h­k, 5m, and 5o) are far more selective for TACE over MMP-1 than the analogous N-methyl sulfonamides (5b, 5e, 5g, 5l, 5n, and 5p), with selectivity ratios ranging from 80- to 2000-fold. That the butynyl group of these analogues does in fact reside in the S10 -

In contrast to selectivity, activity in the THP-1 cellular assay14 is improved for the N-methyl sulfonamides relative to the NH-derivatives, with the exception of the glycine (5a, 5b) and penicillamine (5m, 5n) series. Cellular potency also improves with increasing steric bulk of the alkyl amino acids in both the NH and N-methyl sulfonamide series, but selectivity over MMP-1 decreases as substitution on the amino acid b-carbon increases (compare 5d, 5f, and 5h), presumably due in part to beneficial interactions with the S20 pocket of the MMPs. An exception is the geminal dimethyl analogue 5i, which has poor cell activity, although it has > 100-fold selctivity for TACE over both MMP-1 and MMP-9. In search of a boost in cellular potency several analogues were prepared with polar functionality incorporated in the inhibitor P1, or P20 groups. Appending a picolyl group to the sulfonamide nitrogen in the glycine series (5c) does not affect enzyme potency, but increases cell activity relative to the corresponding NH and Nmethyl analogues (5a­b). A threonine residue (5j) provides good selectivity over each of the MMPs tested along with moderate cellular potency. Compounds 5k­ p, with basic amines in the P1 substituent, also offered no distinct advantage over the alanine and valine analogues in terms of their potency in the THP assay. To investigate whether the butynyloxy P10 group, optimal for TACE enzyme and cell activity in the anthranilate sulfonamide series,7 was preferred for the a-amino hydroxamate series the analogues in Table 2 were prepared. The propargyl amine 12a and thioether 12b are both less potent than butynyl ether 5b in the enzyme and cellular assays. Surprisingly, nitrile 12c is poorly

active against TACE, although whether it is the carbon linker or the nitrile that is not tolerated has not been determined. The acyclic b-amino acid derivatives, 13a­b, are not as potent against TACE enzyme as 5a­b, but appear to be greater than 100-fold selective over MMP-1, -9, and-13 (Table 3). Unfortunately, both compounds are also less active in the cellular assay at 3 mM. Additional work in this series aimed at enhanced cellular potency will be reported in due course. The in vivo activity of compounds 5d­5p was initially measured by their ability to inhibit the LPS-stimulated production of TNF-a in a mouse.14 Several of these compounds (5d, 5h, and 5p), dosed at 50 mg/kg po, provided greater than 75% inhibition of TNF-a levels one h after administration of LPS, and two (5f and 5j) gave greater than 50% inhibition at 25 mg/kg po. The most potent analogue in this model was threonine derivative 5j with an ED50 of 3 mg/kg po. The potential of these compounds to be effective treatments for RA was then assessed by activity in a mouse prophylactic collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) efficacy model, a standard model of human RA.15 Compound 5j is reproducibly active at reducing clinical severity scores in this efficacy model at 20 mg/kg po bid (n=4) and has shown activity at 10 mg/kg po bid (n=2). Furthermore, 5j has excellent bioavailability at 10 mg/kg in the mouse (100%), rat (46%), dog (75%) and monkey (17%), and inhibits LPS-stimulated TNF-a production in human whole blood with an IC50 of 1 mM. Compound 5j is stable in liver microsomes of several species, including humans. The glucuronide, observed in CD-1 mouse and cynomologous monkey, is the only metabolite seen. In summary, we have synthesized a series of butynyloxy-based a-sulfonamide hydroxamate inhibitors of MMPs and TACE. Many of these compounds are potent inhibitors of TACE in an isolated enzyme assay and in THP-1 cells, with several possessing greater than 100-fold selectivity for TACE over MMP-1 and MMP9. Oral activity has been demonstrated for several of these compounds in a mouse model of LPS-stimulated TNF-a production and one (5j) shows good oral potency in a prophylactic CIA efficacy model. The extension of this work to additional inhibitor scaffolds will be reported in due course.

Arthritis was induced in female mice, aged 6­8 weeks, by intradermal injection at the base of the tail with 100 mL (100 mg) of type II collagen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) supplemented with additional 2 mg/mL of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Ra. Mice were dosed with drug twice a day, while control mice received vehicle only. Dosing began on day 18 prior to the onset of arthritis and continued for 17 days. On day 21, disease was induced by injecting 40 mg of LPS intraperitoneally.
