The crystal structure of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligand binding domain in a ternary complex with dexamethasone and a TIF2 coactivator peptide has been determined recently. The structure reveals several distinct features not found in other nuclear receptors, such as a novel dimerization interface and a second charge clamp that might be important in determining coactivator binding selectivity. The GR ligand binding domain also has a steroid binding pocket that is distinct from other nuclear receptors and might explain its selectivity for glucocorticoids and its diversity of responses. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that are involved in numerous physiological processes such as endocrine homeostasis, stress responses, lipid metabolism, inflammation and apoptosis [1]. Their biological actions are mediated through the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which acts by activating or repressing the expression

of target genes [2,3]. Glucocorticoids represent one of the most widely used and effective treatments for several clinical conditions, and are used for their anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases, including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and allergic rhinitis. However, long-term use of glucocorticoids is limited by adverse side-effects ranging from the suppression of the hypothalamic­ pituitary axis and growth retardation to osteoporosis. A leading hypothesis is that the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids occur through a mechanism involving GR-mediated repression of genes whereas the side-effects might result from the transactivation of genes. However, this hypothesis is controversial because some side-effects appear to be mediated by both transactivation and transrepression of genes [4,5]. A goal of several pharmaceutical companies is to develop glucocorticoids that maintain their efficacy and beneficial anti-inflammatory action but with reduced side-effects. The design of such compounds, unquestionably, will be aided by knowledge of

the structure of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the GR and an understanding of how its interactions with coregulatory molecules contribute to transactivation and transrepression of genes. The LBD of the GR has important functions in addition to ligand binding, including receptor dimerization, coactivator binding, transcriptional activation and transrepression [3,6­ 8]. Understanding how these functions relate to the structure of the GR LBD remains of both biological and therapeutic importance. Crystallization of the GR LBD To date, insight into structure of the LBD of the GR has been derived from molecular modeling based on crystal structures of LBDs from related nuclear receptors. Although the structure of the DNA binding domain of the GR [9] has been known for several years, the crystal structure of the LBD remained elusive because of purification difficulties relating to the solubility of the protein. Recently, Bledsoe and colleagues overcame these difficulties by introducing a single point mutation at residue 602 in helix 5 of the LBD of the GR [10]. The mutation improved the expression and solubility of the LBD with no apparent effect on GR function as determined by in vitro and transcriptional assays [10]. The human GR LBD was crystallized in a ternary complex with dexamethasone and an LxxLL peptide from the coactivator TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor 2) (Fig. 1). The structure of the LBD was reported based on two crystals at ° ° a resolution of 2.8 A and 2.5 A, respectively. Although the

overall structure of the GR LBD is similar to other nuclear receptor LBDs, with 11 a-helixes and four b-strands folded into a three-layer helical sandwich, there are several features unique to the GR LBD. These include a distinct dimerization interface, a second charge clamp and a unique steroid binding pocket. The dimer interface Ligand-dependent dimerization of nuclear receptors requires portions of both the LBD and the DNA binding domain. Crystallographic studies have revealed that the dimerization interface in estrogen receptor (ER) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) dimers occurs predominantly through helix 10 with contributions from helices 7, 8 and 9 [11,12]. By contrast, the progesterone receptor (PR) contains a smaller and less stable dimer interface as a result of the position of helix 12 and a C-terminal extension of its LBD [13]. The recent crystallization of the GR LBD by Bledsoe et al. has defined a distinct dimerization interface of the GR LBD. Like that of the PR [13], the dimerization interface of the GR LBD does not involve contact points within helix 10 (which are involved in ER and RXR dimers) [11,12]. Rather, the GR LBD contains a distinct dimerization interface that involves the formation of a central hydrophobic intermolecular b-sheet. This interface is formed by interactions of residues P625 and I628 in the b-turns of strands 3 and 4 [10]. Mutation of residue P625 to alanine resulted in decreased transactivation and repression, consistent with studies reporting defective ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of the mutant [14]. Mutation of residue I628 resulted in decreased GR-mediated activation but did not change the ability of the GR to transrepress nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling. Thus, these findings suggest that the novel dimerization interface is important for both transactivation and transrepression. Coactivator recognition The binding of agonist compounds to nuclear receptors induces a conformational change in the AF-2 (activation function 2) helix of the receptors, revealing a recognition site groove for interaction with coactivators [15,16]. The coactivators bind the AF-2 helix via LxxLL sequence motifs termed NR-boxes, found in multiple copies within the coactivator protein [2,16,17]. Nuclear receptors discriminate among individual NR-boxes of coactivators; however, the basis for this selectivity remains unclear. Structural analysis of several LBDs in complex with either the first (LLQLL) or second (LHRLL) NR-box of the coactivators TIF2 ­GRIP-1 (GR interacting protein 1) or SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator 1) reveal that the terminal ends of the motif interact with conserved residues of the AF-2 helix through hydrogen bonding [11­ 13,16]. A `charge clamp' is formed that positions the motif within the recognition groove of the AF-2 helix [16]. In contrast to these structures, the GR LBD was crystallized with the third NR-box (LRYLLD) from the coactivator TIF2 (Fig. 2). Previous work indicates that the GR associates preferentially with this peptide motif [16]. The structure reveals the LBD interacts with residues of the third motif through two charge clamps. Residues E755 of the AF-2 helix and

K579 of helix 3 in the GR form the first charge clamp with leucine residues conserved at the ends of the third NR-box, as is observed with the first and second NR-boxes [16]. However, the additional charge clamp interacts with arginine (R þ 2) and aspartic acid (D þ 6) residues that are only present within the third NR-box (LR YLLD). Bledsoe and colleagues also showed that the residues of the second charge clamp in GR, D590 and R585, are conserved among oxosteroid receptors such as the androgen receptor (AR), PR and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), but not in other nuclear receptors such as the ER [10]. Mutation of the arginine and aspartic acid residues of the LR YLLD motif in the coactivator or GR residues D590 and R585 involved in the second charge clamp in the GR, PR and MR resulted in decreased binding of the coactivator peptide and decreased transcriptional function [10]. Bledsoe and colleagues propose that the presence of the second charge clamp might be a mechanism by which oxosteroid receptors can selectively bind coactivators that contain the third LRYLLD motif. Coactivators containing the conserved third LRYLLD motif are members of the SRC family [18] that include SRC-1, TIF2 ­ GRIP-1 and RAC ­ pCIP (also known as SRC-3). Steroid binding pocket The structure of the GR LBD reveals the presence of a ligand binding pocket that is distinct from the steroidshaped pockets of the ER, PR and AR. Thus, the GR LBD contains an additional side pocket that is formed as a result of changes in the positions of helix 6 and 7 [10], which are caused by differences in the sequences of the helices in the GR compared with the ER, PR and AR [10]. Moreover, the related MR has high sequence homology in helix 6 and 7 to the glucocorticoid receptor, suggesting that it might also contain this side pocket. Bledsoe and colleagues propose that this pocket allows for the selective

binding of glucocorticoids and some mineralocorticoids that have larger substituents at the C17a position than other steroids [10]. The absence of the pocket in nuclear receptors such as ER, PR and AR might explain their inability to bind corticoids. However, the GR and MR have overlapping ligand binding specificities [19]. The GR binds only glucocorticoids, whereas MR binds both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. If the presence of the side pocket can explain the ability of the receptors to bind glucocorticoids, what dictates mineralocorticoid selectivity? Bledsoe et al. propose that differences in hydrogen bond formation between the receptors can explain steroid selectivity. Glucocorticoids have a 17a-hydroxyl group at their C17a position, whereas mineralocorticoids lack this group. The crystal structure of the GR LBD indicates that residue Q642 of the GR forms a hydrogen bond with the 17ahydroxyl group of dexamethasone (Fig. 3). The lack of a 17a-hydroxyl group in mineralocorticoids might help explain why the GR fails to bind these steroids. Similarly, Bledsoe and colleagues suggest that a leucine residue at the corresponding residue in the MR would prevent hydrogen bond formation between glucocorticoids and the MR. Differences in hydrogen bonding in the MR might explain its selectivity for both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid. Together, these findings suggest that the selectively of the GR for glucocorticoids might result from the formation of a distinct side pocket and the distribution of hydrogen bonding. Evaluation of these hypotheses will come with the crystallization of the MR LBD. Concluding remarks The recent crystallization of the GR LBD by Bledsoe et al. helps to provide a firm basis for understanding the structure of the LBD, determining structure ­ activity relationships, analyzing mutations of the LBD and will be useful in the design of novel glucocorticoids for the treatment of diseases. Furthermore, the structure provides novel insight into the

Support for the author's findings and further insight into the GR LBD structure and function will certainly come with future crystallizations of the LBD with other glucocorticoids, antagonists and coactivator peptides.

Do unpredictable toxic side-effects of drugs reflect their promiscuous binding energies?
Alan Wiseman
Biochemistry Group, School of Biomedical & Life Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK GU2 7XH.

Laudable attempts by Kenakin and Onaran to explain the paradox that drug efficacy remains separable from drug affinity at receptors [1] has produced a `probabilistic' concept in silico of time-profiling in the oscillation between receptor conformations. Toxic side-effects of seemingly receptor-specific drugs might therefore result from differential binding energies, where the drug itself selects the receptor conformation. Moreover, the selection of the receptor conformation by drugs initiates a series of short-lived, low-energy drug ­ receptor conformations. This concept is accepted in molecular enzymology where the active-site configuration leads to dispersal of the binding energy of the substrate among active-site amino acid residues; attainment of a lowered energy

transition state thereby allows the progression of the conversion of the substrate to products [2]. The side-effects of drug binding to receptors are also dependent on a variety of cofactors that are characteristic of the tissue. Indeed, in the brain, the blood ­ brain barrier, when circumvented by small lipid-soluble translocator drugs, displays a wider than expected range of problems with respect to the promiscuous nature of the binding of neuroleptic agents to neuroreceptors (or at least the side-effects of these drugs are more obvious). Furthermore, in silico, correct predictions of drug specificity will require an approach that includes analysis of the receptor conformation that is adopted [3,4], whereas bioassay of the metabolites of drugs that increase the
