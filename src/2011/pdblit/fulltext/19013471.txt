Abstract Diaminopimelate (DAP) epimerase catalyzes the stereoinversion of LL-DAP to meso-DAP, a precursor of L-lysine and an essential component of the bacterial peptidoglycan. This function is vital to bacteria and the enzyme therefore represents an attractive target for the design of novel anti-bacterials. DAP epimerase belongs to the group of PLP-independent amino acid racemases that function through a rather unusual mechanism involving two cysteines acting in concert as a base (thiolate) and an acid (thiol). We have solved ° ° the crystal structures of the apo-forms of DAP epimerase mutants (C73S and C217S) from Haemophilus influenzae at 2.3 A and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. These structures provide a snapshot of the enzyme in the first step of the catalytic cycle. Comparisons with the structures of the inhibitor-bound form reveal that the enzyme adopts an `open conformation' in the absence of substrates or inhibitors with the two active site cysteines existing as a thiol­thiolate pair. Substrate binding to the C-terminal domain triggers the closure of the N-terminal domain coupled with tight encapsulation of the ligand, stabilization of the conformation of an active site loop containing Cys73 and expulsion of water molecules with concomitant desolvation of the thiolate base. This structural rearrangement is critical for catalysis. Ó 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The increased microbial resistance to conventional antibiotics has stimulated interest in new methods of inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis [1]. One approach involves blocking the formation of D-amino acids such as D-alanine, D-glutamate and meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP) that are present in the peptidoglycan [1,2]. Many D-amino acids, including those necessary for bacterial cell wall formation, are synthesized from the corresponding L-isomers by a-amino acid racemases [3,4]. Some of them, such as glutamate racemase [4], aspartate racemase [5], proline racemase [6] and diaminopimelate (DAP) epimerase [7] invert

the configuration at the a-carbon atom of the amino acid without the aid of cofactors, metals, reducible keto or imino functionalities. A two-base mechanism involving two cysteines has been proposed for this group of enzymes [6­9]. It entails one active site cysteine thiolate acting as a general base to deprotonate the a-carbon and a second cysteine thiol acting as a general acid to reprotonate the resulting planar anionic intermediate from the opposite face (Scheme 1). This represents a particularly challenging chemical problem, as it implies the deprotonation of a very weakly acidic proton, the amino acid's a-hydrogen by a relatively poor base, a cysteine. The debate surrounding the mechanism by which the significant energetic barrier for a-deprotonation is overcome in these enzymes has made

LL-

and meso-DAP.

considerable progress recently with the availability of three-dimensional structures of several PLP-independent racemases [10­14]. DAP epimerase represents a unique member of this group because its substrates, LL-DAP and meso-DAP, contain two stereocenters (Scheme 1). This enzyme exhibits very strict requirements for its substrates, and only accepts DAP isomers with the L configuration at the distal site [2,14,15]. Furthermore, DAP analogs lacking an amino or carboxyl group are neither substrates nor effective inhibitors [16]. Development of a rationale to explain these observations has been hampered by the lack of sufficient structural information about this enzyme. Initial crystal structures of the apo wild-type DAP epimerase from Haemophilus influenzae revealed a novel pseudosymmetric arrangement of two structurally homologous a + b domains for this 274 amino acid enzyme, with a proposed active site lying at the interface of the two domains [12,13]. Unfortunately, these structures were all of an inactive-form of the enzyme with a collapsed active site due to the formation of a disulfide-link between the two catalytic cysteines, Cys73 and Cys217. Our recent crystallographic studies of DAP epimerase inhibited by two different isomers of the substrate mimic and irreversible inhibitor, AziDAP (2-(4-amino-4-carboxybutyl) aziridine2-carboxylic acid)) provide for the first time a detailed picture of the active site environment surrounding the substrates. However, a limitation of these structures is that they do not provide insight into the extensive reorganization that occurs during substrate recognition and binding. Although, the two AziDAP-bound complexes of DAP epimerase are similar to each other, they display significant conformational rearrangement with respect to the inactive disulfide-linked enzyme [14]. Despite considerable efforts by several groups [12,13], no crystal structure of an enzymatically active wild-type DAP epimerase has been obtained. If both C73 and C217 are present, they oxidize to a disulfide prior to crystallization. In previous work [17], we found that the C73S and C217S mutants of DAP epimerase are enzymatically active, albeit at a considerably reduced level, in that they can remove the a-hydrogen of DAP and can also catalyze the elimination of hydrogen fluoride from 3-fluoro-2,6,-diaminopimelate. Here, we describe the crystal structures of the single mutants C73S and C217S of DAP epimerase from H. influenzae. These structures provide a true representation

of the `open conformation' of the enzyme prior to substrate binding and form significant new tools for the rational design and discovery of novel inhibitors of this important protein drug target. Comparison of the mutant structures to those of the inhibitor-bound enzyme provides insights into the conformational reorganization necessary for catalysis. Materials and methods
Cloning, expression and purification of C73S and C217S DAP epimerase mutants. Two pairs of complementary primers, C73Sf(5 0 -AGTTTCG CAAAGCGGAAATGGTG-3 0 )/C73Sr(5 0 -CACCATTTCCGCTTTGCG AAACT-3 0 ) and C217Sf(5 0 -AACTCAAGCCAGTGGAAGTGGTG-3 0 )/ C217Sr(5 0 -CACCACTTCCACTGGCTTCA-GTT-3 0 ), containing mutations (bold characters) corresponding to C73S and C217S of the diaminopimelate epimerase open reading frame were synthesized. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Insertion of the correct mutations was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Expression and purification of the mutant enzymes were accomplished following the protocol for the wild-type enzyme [12]. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry confirmed the mass of the mutant epimerases and the purity of the samples. The purified enzymes were then dialyzed against Hepes buffer (pH 8.0, 25 mM Hepes/5 mM DTT) and concentrated using a Millipore Ultrafree Biomax 10K concentrator to 20 mg/ml. Structure determination. X-ray diffraction quality crystals for the C73S and C217S mutant enzymes were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Intensity data from flash frozen crystals were collected at beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, to resolutions ° ° of 2.3 A and 2.2 A for the C73S and C217S mutants, respectively. Crystal structures of the C73S and C217S mutants of DAP epimerase were solved by molecular replacement with the coordinates of the inactive disulfidelinked enzyme (pdb id: 1GQZ) as the search model. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein data bank with accession codes 2Q9H (C73S) and 2Q9J (C217S). The details of the crystallization and the structural calculations are described in the Supplementary online material.

Results and discussion Structural analysis of enzymatically active C73S and C217S DAP epimerase mutants Crystal structures of the single mutants C73S and C217S of DAP epimerase have been determined to resolutions of ° ° 2.3 A and 2.2 A, respectively. The overall conformation of the enzyme remains mostly unaltered following mutagenesis. The enzyme is composed of two structurally equivalent domains, an N-terminal domain (residues 1:117 and 263:274) and a C-terminal domain (residues 118:262), with

the active site located in a solvent accessible cleft at the domain interface. Both the C73S and C217S mutant enzyme structures are very similar to each other with a root ° mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.38 A for their 274 Ca atom pairs. Superposition of each mutant with the inactive ° disulfide enzyme (pdb id: 1GQZ) results in a rmsd of 0.6 A ° (C217S) for the corresponding 274 Ca (C73S) and 0.81 A atom pairs. Notably, the C-terminal domains of the mutants and the inactive disulfide enzyme match more clo° ° sely with an rmsd of 0.21 A (C73S) and 0.23 A (C217S). Although, the overall fold of the C73S and C217S mutants is grossly similar to that of the inactive disulfide enzyme, there are several significant differences. In particular, the mutant enzymes both adopt a more open conformation than the inactive disulfide-linked enzyme (Fig. 1A and B). However, the most striking difference between the mutants and the inactive disulfide enzyme is in the movement of the active site loop residues Gln72-Asn75 from the N-terminal domain, positioning Cys73 away from its catalytic partner Cys217. In the structures of the inactive disulfide enzyme [12,13], the loop residues Gln72-Asn75 are pulled in towards the C-terminal domain due to the formation of a disulfide link between Cys73 and Cys217. As a consequence of this movement, the Ca positions of residues

Ser73 in the C73S mutant and Cys73 in the C217S mutant ° ° differ by 3.8 A and 3.3 A, respectively, from the Ca position of Cys73 in the inactive disulfide enzyme (Fig. 1C and D). Crystal packing could not possibly have influenced these differences, since the crystals of the two mutants, as well as the inactive disulfide enzyme are isomorphous, packing in an identical fashion into the orthorhombic space group C2221 and hence are all subject to similar crystal contacts. Asymmetry in the active site prior to ligand binding Both the C73S and C217S mutant enzyme structures reveal a clear difference in the environments of the two catalytic residues (positions 73 and 217) (Fig. 2A and B). Cys73 (Ser73 in the C73S mutant) is a part of an active site loop Gln72-Asn75 which differs significantly from its position in the inactive disulfide-linked enzyme. The higher ° temperature factors for residues Gln72-Asn75 of 76.7 A2 ° 2 (C217S) compared to the protein aver(C73S) and 65.7 A ° ° age of 40.1 A2 (C73S) and 44.6 A2 (C217S) is indicative of the intrinsic flexibility of this region of the enzyme. In the mutants as well as in the inactive disulfide enzyme, two active site helices Ala77-Leu86 (helix A) and Ala218Met230 (helix B) lie facing each other at the domain inter-

face. Cys73 is located three residues away from the helix A; its side chain is partially exposed and makes van der Waals ° contacts (3.5­4 A) with surrounding residues Gly74, Met118, Met155 and Asn157 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Cys217 (Ser217 in the C217S mutant) is positioned at the N-terminus of helix B; its Sc atom forms hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogen atom of Gly220, Oc of Ser219 and two water molecules (Fig. 2B). Interaction with the positive dipole of helix B, coupled with stabilization through hydrogen bonds could favor the formation of a thiolate at position Cys217. In the C217S mutant enzyme, Cys73 is oxidized to a sulfenic acid (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary online material). Sulfenic acid derivatives have been demonstrated in the active sites of a number of cysteine-dependent enzymes [18]. However, it seems unlikely that an oxidized form of cysteine might be of significance to the mechanism or to the regulation of DAP epimerase and is probably an artifact of the ex-vivo treatment. Structural reorganization upon the binding of substrate analogs The crystal structures of the two mutant enzymes reveal a highly `open conformation' of the enzyme as opposed to the `closed conformation' found in the structures of the wild-type enzyme bound to irreversible substrate analog inhibitors, LL-AziDAP or DL-AziDAP [14]. Superposition of the entire C73S structure onto the LL-AziDAP-bound ° enzyme yields an rmsd of 2.73 A for the 274 Ca atom pairs. However, the individual domains are more similar with an ° rmsd of 0.34 A for the 145 Ca atom pairs of the C-terminal ° domains and an rmsd of 1.08 A for the 129 Ca atom pairs of the N-terminal domains. The two inhibitor-bound structures of DAP epimerase have both isomers of the substrate analog irreversibly bound. In these structures, there is a tight encapsulation of the DAP skeleton that is achieved via a 20° rotation of the N-terminal domain relative to the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3A).

As described earlier, two internal a-helices A(Ala77Leu86) and B (Gly218-Met230) lie with their positive dipoles facing one another at the domain interface in the mutant enzyme. The distances between the Ca atoms of ° the N-terminal residues of these helices is 9.7 A in the ° C73S mutant and 9.2 A in the C217S mutant. However, ligand binding triggers a winding of the loop residues (Gly74-Gly76) into a helical turn and extending helix A by one turn (Fig. 3 A and B). The distance between the Ca atoms of the N-terminal residues of these helices is ° now reduced to 4.3 A. Such an end on orientation of the positive charge emanating from the two helix dipoles would be highly unstable in the absence of the substrate. The ligand-induced loop reorganization stabilizes the conformation of the active site loop residues Gln72-Asn75, which are highly mobile in the apo-enzyme. As a result, a unique and symmetric active site is created with the catalytic cysteines positioned at the N-termini of two equivalent active site helices. In the enzyme-substrate complex, the retention of this motif supports the earlier proposal by Lloyd et al. [13], that their dipole moments would generate partial positive charges at their N-termini thereby resulting in the observed decrease in the pKa values of the wild-type Cys-73/Cys-217 (6.1 and 7.0) compared to that of 9 for a typical cysteine residues. Furthermore, the inhibitor-bound structures revealed that the N-terminal partial positive charges (+0.5 e) associated with the helix dipoles are directed at the a-carboxylate moieties of the inhibitors. Also, this carboxylate is strongly fixed in place by a total of five hydrogen bonds from the main-chain nitrogen atoms of conserved residues Gly-74, Asn-75, Gly-218, Ser-219 and the side chain Oc of Ser219 [14]. Calculations have indicated that protonated a-carboxyl groups of a-amino acids show dramatically reduced pKas for the aproton [19]. The observed electrostatic environment of the a-carboxylate likely disperses its negative charge far more effectively than would protonation, thereby strongly amplifying this effect [20].

Fig. 3. Conformational changes on inhibitor binding. (A) Domain closure 20° upon binding AziDAP inhibitors is illustrated by superposition of the C° terminal domains (rmsd = 0.34 A for 145 Ca pairs) of the C73S mutant (salmon) and LL-AziDAP-bound DAP epimerase (pdb id: 1GKE, purple). (B) Closer-view of the conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of DAP epimerase upon binding ligands (AziDAP; carbon, green). Loop (residues Gly74-Gly76) reorganization creates a symmetric catalytic site in which two active site a-helices (A,B) face each other and position the catalytic cysteines (Cys73 and Cys217; ball-and-stick, sulfur, yellow) at the N-termini of their respective helices. (C) Stereo-view of the hydrogen-bonded network (black dotted lines) involving residues lining the active site cavity in the AziDAP-bound enzyme (ball-and-stick; carbon, purple; oxygen, red; nitrogen, blue; sulfur, yellow). Corresponding residues from the C73S mutant (line model; carbon, salmon) are shown to illustrate the restructuring of the active site residues from the N-terminal domain of the enzyme upon inhibitor binding.

Comparison of the mutants with the inhibitor-bound enzyme also reveals a marked rearrangement of the amino-acid side chains lining the active site cavity accompanying the domain closure. The residues lining this cavity are largely conserved across all the DAP epimerase sequences isolated from different bacterial species and include Asn11, Phe13, Gln44, Tyr60, Asn64, Val70, Gln72, Cys73, Gly74, Asn75, Asn157, Asn190, Glu208, Arg209, Cys217, Gly218 and Ser219. Many of these residues form an extended hydrogen-bonded network around the inhibitor (Fig. 3C). This highly structured active site is absent in the open form observed in the mutants, as well as in the inactive disulfide enzyme and is a result of the changes in the side-chain conformations of the active-site residues accompanying ligand binding. Furthermore, the conformational changes induced by ligand binding result ° in an additional 74 contacts (<4 A) between the two domains of the enzyme. Of these interactions, most prom° inent are the hydrogen bonds (2.9­3.0 A) formed between

the side chains of conserved residues Asp66 and Arg188 in the inhibitor bound enzyme (Fig. 3C). These interactions at the entrance of the active site act like a `latch' sealing the active-site cavity from the outside solvent. The corresponding distances between Asp66 and Arg188 in the two serine mutants and the inactive disulfide enzyme are in the range ° of 14­16 A. Insights into the chemical mechanism The emerging mechanistic picture is that in the absence of substrate, catalytically competent DAP epimerase has its substrate binding cleft open (as in the two active serine mutants). A highly mobile active site loop, Gln72-Asn75, helps to orient the acid­base functionality of the catalytic cysteines, which exist as a thiol­thiolate pair prior to ligand binding. Comparisons of the C-terminal domains across all the DAP epimerase structures, including the `closed' ligand-bound form and the `open' form observed in the

552

serine mutants, as well as in the inactive-disulfide enzyme reveal no significant conformational differences (rmsds ° 0.2­0.3 A). In contrast, the residues from the N-terminal domain display major conformational rearrangements on binding ligands (Fig. 3C). Thus, it is likely that the substrate initially binds to the C-terminal domain, with its a-carboxyl group anchored strongly through electrostatic interactions with the N-termini of helix B (Ala218Met230). Optimally positioned residues Asn157, Asn190, Glu208, Arg209, Cys217, Gly218 and Ser219 of the C-terminal domain provide the initial substrate binding interactions. The binding of a DAP substrate triggers the N-terminal domain closure on the substrate (as seen in the two structures with AziDAP isomers) with the expulsion of solvating water and the concomitant formation of the extensive network of hydrogen bonds necessary for catalysis. This desolvation creates a hydrophobic environment that greatly enhances the basicity of the thiolate anion [14]. The pKas of the catalytic cysteines are lowered to 6.1 and 7.0 [7,13] as a result of interactions with the positive dipole of the neighboring helices. Together with an optimal stereoelectronic alignment of the scissile hydrogen to Ca bond with the fully hydrogen-bonded carboxylate, this effect promotes the formation of a delocalized anionic character at the a-carbon (Scheme 1). The thiol on the opposite side of the resulting carbanion is thus ideally positioned in the closed active site to deliver a proton to the a-carbon, thereby completing the epimerization process. In summary, the crystal structures of the enzymatically active C73S and C217S mutants of DAP epimerase reported in this study taken together with our earlier investigation of the wild-type enzyme inhibited with AziDAP isomers [14] reveal the importance of protein domain closure for effective catalysis and exquisite substrate specificity. This high level of substrate specificity represents a considerable challenge in the design of effective DAP epimerase inhibitors We propose that the `open conformation' observed in the mutants provides a better scaffold for the design of inhibitors of this enzyme as potential antibacterial agents. Development of allosteric inhibitors that trap the epimerase in the open state may provide an effective means to block the enzyme [21]. Not only is wild-type enzyme likely to exist primarily in this open conformation prior to binding of the substrate, but the entry of inhibitors into the active site of the closed form of the enzyme is also likely to be even more difficult.
