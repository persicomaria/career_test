Abstract The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) ordinarily exists in electrophoretically distinct hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated forms. Human cytomegalovirus infection induced forms of this subunit whose electrophoretic mobilities were intermediate without decreases in abundance of the original forms. Phosphatase treatment nearly eliminated the intermediate migrating forms. In vitro, the viral protein kinase, UL97, phosphorylated this subunit, a recombinant protein containing the CTD, and peptides containing the CTD consensus sequence, YSPTSPS. Phosphorylation occurred predominantly on serine 5 and was substantially reduced when either serine 2 or 5 was already phosphorylated. The abundance of the intermediate and hypophosphorylated forms was reduced at most twofold during infections in which UL97 was genetically or pharmacologically inhibited. These results identify a new pattern of RNA polymerase II modification induced by virus infection and a viral enzyme that phosphorylates the CTD in vitro, but only possibly in vivo.

Introduction RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) is the enzyme that transcribes protein-coding genes in eukaryotic cells. The largest subunit of RNAP II includes a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), which lies next to the exit groove for nascent transcripts (Cramer et al., 2001). The CTD consists of highly conserved heptapeptide repeats (consensus sequence, YSPTSPS), the number of which varies among organisms (Allison et al., 1988). During the initiation and elongation phases of transcription, the CTD cycles through various

phosphorylation states of which the major two forms (RNAP IIA and IIO) can be distinguished by electrophoretic mobility (reviewed in Hirose and Manley, 2000; Kobor and Greenblatt, 2002; Maniatis and Reed, 2002; Oelgeschlager, ¨ 2002; Palancade and Bensaude, 2003). In particular, RNAP II whose CTD is hypophosphorylated (RNAP IIA) is preferentially recruited to preinitiation complexes at a promoter. Then, during initiation and elongation, the CTD becomes highly phosphorylated, resulting in the hyperphosphorylated form, RNAP IIO. CTD phosphorylation is controlled by several cellular kinases. Some of these, such as the kinase component of transcription elongation factor PTEFb (CDK9/cyclin T1), have been reported to phosphorylate the serines at either or both the second and fifth positions (Ser-2 and Ser-5) in the consensus sequence, although others, such as the kinase component of the general transcription initiation factor (TF) IIH (CDK7/cyclin H), mainly phosphorylate Ser-5 (Kim et al., 2002; Ramanathan et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2000). These specific phosphorylation events mediate different transcriptional activities of the CTD and couple transcription to posttran-

scriptional processes such as capping, splicing, and polyadenylation. Thus, changes in CTD phosphorylation are of considerable interest. Many viruses induce alterations in host cell gene expression. These alterations include changes in the transcriptional machinery such as modification of the CTD (reviewed in Knipe et al., 2001). One well-studied example is the recruitment of CDK9/cyclin T1 by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat protein, which results in hyperphosphorylation of the CTD and stimulation of elongation of HIV transcripts (reviewed in Taube et al., 1999). A second example occurs during herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Early during the course of viral infection, the phosphorylation state of the largest subunit of RNAP II is altered, such that the IIO and IIA forms are depleted and replaced with alternately phosphorylated forms of intermediate electrophoretic mobility (Rice et al., 1994). These new forms of RNAP II collectively are referred to as RNAP IIi (intermediate or infected cell form). The HSV protein kinase UL13 and viral immediate early protein ICP22 are each required for the efficient formation of RNAP IIi, for the efficient depletion of the IIA form, and for the efficient expression of certain viral genes (Long et al., 1999; Purves et al., 1993). However, it has not been shown that the UL13 protein kinase phosphorylates RNAP II or its CTD, and indeed, the possibility that the effect on RNAP II (e.g., via effects on ICP22 or cell kinases), is indirect has been entertained (Long et al., 1999). Like HSV, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus. The HCMV homolog of HSV UL13 is UL97 (Chee et al., 1989). Both proteins are members of the HvUL protein kinase family (McGeoch et al., 1995). UL97 is perhaps the most atypical member of this family. UL97 has been heterologously expressed, purified, and characterized (Baek et al., 2002a, 2002b; He et al., 1997). It is a serine/threonine protein kinase with several unusual properties including a high pH optimum, resistance to high salt concentrations, and an uncommon preference for peptide substrates with basic residues at the P + 5 position (Baek et al., 2002b; He et al., 1997). It also has the ability to phosphorylate certain nucleoside analogs such as ganciclovir, which is important for their antiviral activities (Littler et al., 1992; Sullivan et al., 1992; Talarico et al., 1999). UL97 is critical for viral replication (Krosky et al., 2003b; Prichard et al., 1999; Wolf et al., 2001). In contrast, HSV UL13 is less critical for viral replication (Long et al., 1999; Overton et al., 1994; Purves et al., 1993) and lacks the ability to phosphorylate nucleoside analogs (Ng et al., 1996). Interestingly, the modest replication defect of an HSV UL13 mutant can be repaired by HCMV UL97 (Ng et al., 1996). This raised the possibility that HCMV infection or UL97 might modify RNAP II. To investigate this possibility, we studied the effects of infection by wild-type HCMV on the electrophoretic mobility of the largest subunit of RNAP II. We found that HCMV infection induced the formation of RNAP IIi, but without

depletion of the IIA or IIO. This led us to investigate the phosphorylation of RNAP II and its CTD in vitro by UL97, and the importance of UL97 for modification of RNAP II in cells.

Results Modification of RNAP II during HCMV infection During HSV infection, the abundance of hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms of the largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (RNAP IIA and RNAP IIO, respectively) declines and the abundance of intermediately migrating forms (RNAP IIi) increases (Rice et al., 1994). To investigate phosphorylated forms of RNAP II during HCMV infection, lysates from mock-infected cells or cells infected for various times with wt HCMV were analyzed by immunoblotting using two different monoclonal antibodies directed against the largest subunit of RNAP II. The monoclonal antibody, ARNA 3a, recognizes both IIA and IIO, while the monoclonal antibody 8WG16, whose binding is blocked by phosphorylation of Ser-2, recognizes the hypophosphorylated form, IIA, but not the hyperphosphorylated form, IIO (Cho et al., 2001; Patturajan et al., 1998). Both antibodies recognize the HSV-induced IIi forms (Rice et al., 1994). Within 24 h p.i. by HCMV, both RNAP IIO (Fig. 1, top panel) and IIA (Fig. 1, top and bottom panels) accumulated above the levels seen in uninfected cells. This increase continued through 72 h p.i. During the same time period, there was little change in the amount of RNAP II in mockinfected cells (data not shown). In addition, in HCMVinfected cells, there was a progressive appearance of intermediate migrating forms, beginning about 24 h p.i. and becoming especially evident from 60 h through 72 h, where there abundance increased more than did the IIA and IIO

forms. These will be referred to as RNAP IIi, based on their similarity to the forms observed during HSV infection (Rice et al., 1994). To determine if the altered electrophoretic mobilities of the RNAP IIi species are due to phosphorylation, we treated lysates with lambda phosphatase before analysis by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Whether detected with antibody ARNA 3a (top panel) or 8WG16 (bottom panel), the RNAP IIi species nearly disappeared following phosphatase treatment (lane 3), leaving the IIA species as the only abundant RNAP II form. Mock incubation had little or no effect (lane 2). Thus, the formation of intermediately phosphorylated forms of RNAP II (RNAP IIi) appears to be similar between HSV and HCMV; however, unlike the case during HSV infection, forms IIA and IIO are not depleted, but rather accumulate. Modification of the largest subunit of RNAP II, GST-CTD, and CTD peptide by UL97 in vitro The alterations in RNAP II that we observed in HCMVinfected cells increased our interest in the possibility that UL97 could directly phosphorylate RNAP II on its CTD. To investigate this possibility, we initially assayed whether

Lysates were prepared and dialyzed against lambda phosphatase buffer as described in Materials and methods and then either incubated for 30 min alone, either on ice (lane 1) or at 30 jC (lane 2), or with lambda phosphatase (lane 3). The top panel shows an immunoblot probed with ARNA3a, which recognizes RNAP II large subunit regardless of phosphorylation state, and the bottom panel shows an immunoblot probed with 8WG16, which does not recognized the hyperphosphorylated form (IIO).

purified RNAP II (from yeast; Cho et al., 1997) could be phosphorylated by purified recombinant GST-UL97. Recombinant, purified yeast TFIIH (Cho et al., 1997) was used as a positive control. The largest subunit of RNAP II was phosphorylated by both TFIIH and UL97 (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). To test for the specificity of phosphorylation by UL97, we employed a specific UL97 inhibitor, maribavir (Baek et al., 2002b; Biron et al., 2002), and a catalytically inactive point mutant of UL97, K355Q (He et al., 1997). Phosphorylation by UL97, but not TFIIH, was abolished by maribavir (lanes 1 and 3). No phosphorylation was observed in the absence of added kinase (lane 5) or using the K355Q mutant (lane 6). Similar amounts of RNAP II were present in each lane, as verified by Coomassie staining of the gel (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Phosphorylation of the largest subunit of RNAP II by TFIIH and other enzymes occurs on the CTD, which consists of heptapeptide consensus repeats of YSPTSPS (Feaver et al., 1991; Lu et al., 1992; Serizawa et al., 1993). Recombinant GST-CTD, consisting of 26 consensus heptads, was tested as a substrate for UL97 and TFIIH and was phosphorylated by both (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 5). As before, phosphorylation of CTD (and autophosphorylation) by UL97 (lane 6), but not TFIIH (lane 4), was essentially eliminated by maribavir. No phosphorylation was observed in the absence of added kinase (lane 1) or using the K355Q mutant (lane 7). To determine if the CTD itself was sufficient to serve as a substrate for UL97, a synthetic peptide consisting of three repeats of the consensus heptapeptide was tested as a substrate. It was phosphorylated extensively by UL97 (Fig. 3C, lane 2). Phosphorylation was eliminated by maribavir, and the K355Q UL97 mutant did not detectably phosphorylate the peptide. We conclude that UL97 can phosphorylate the RNAP II CTD in vitro. UL97 phosphorylates CTD predominantly on Ser-5 Each CTD heptapeptide can potentially be phosphorylated on three different serines, a threonine, and a tyrosine. To determine which amino acid is phosphorylated by UL97, GST-CTD (26 repeats) and the CTD peptide (3 repeats) were each phosphorylated by UL97 using 32P-ATP and hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid. The resulting amino acids were separated electrophoretically, and autoradiography revealed that phosphorylation had occurred nearly exclusively on serine residues (Fig. 4A). In order to identify the specific serine residue(s) phosphorylated, N-terminal sequencing of 32P labeled CTD peptide was performed. Each cycle of sequencing was monitored for the release of radioactivity, and it was found predominantly in cycles corresponding to Ser-5 of the first and second repeat units (Fig. 4B). (Radioactivity in the cycle corresponding to Pro-6 is most likely due to carryover.) Ser-2 of the second repeat and third repeat was also phosphorylated, but to a lesser degree.

Fig. 4. Phosphoamino acid and sequence analysis. (A) GST-CTD and synthetic CTD peptide were phosphorylated by GST-UL97, gel purified, hydrolyzed, and subjected to thin-layer electrophoresis with phosphoserine (P-Ser), phosphothreonine (P-Thr), and phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr) standards. The positions of the phosphoamino acid standards (as indicated between the panels) were visualized with ninhydrin staining, and the position of the radiolabeled peptide visualized by autoradiography. (B) Sequence analysis. Synthetic CTD peptide, phosphorylated by GST-UL97, was subjected to automated sequencing. The material in each fraction was subjected to automated peptide sequencing. The material released at each cycle was split to identify the amino acid by RP-HPLC (shown at the bottom of each panel) and the radioactivity by scintillation counting (indicated by black bars). The major residues phosphorylated are underlined.

Prior phosphorylation of Ser-2 or Ser-5 blocks CTD phosphorylation by UL97 We also investigated the ability of synthetically phosphorylated CTD peptides (in this case, containing four heptad repeats) to serve as substrates for UL97 in vitro. Peptides in which Ser 2 or Ser 5 were synthetically phosphorylated were only very weakly phosphorylated by UL97, with extents of phosphorylation being only 15% and 8% of the unphosphorylated peptide (compare lanes 2 and 3 to lane 1 in Fig. 5), and a peptide in which both Ser 2 and Ser 5 were prephosphorylated was not detectably phosphorylated by UL97 (lane 4). Thus, prior phosphorylation of Ser5 does not result in compensatory utilization of other sites. Moreover, the ability of UL97 to phosphorylate its major

acceptor site on CTD peptides, Ser-5, depends largely on Ser-2 being unphosphorylated. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of UL97 at most modestly affects accumulation of IIi and IIA Given the ability of UL97 to phosphorylate the CTD in vitro, we then compared the effects of infection of an HCMV UL97 null mutant virus (RCD97) with those of wt HCMV on the accumulation of the various forms of RNAP II. As illustrated in Fig. 6, reduced amounts of RNAP IIi and IIA were observed in mutant-infected cells compared with wt-infected cells, whether detected by the ARNA 3a or the 8WG16 antibody. This effect was rather modest compared with the overall increase in RNAP II in virus-infected cells versus mock-infected cells (about twofold less than that of wt based on a dilution series of lysates from wtinfected cells), but reproducible. These differences between mutant and wt were not due to differences in preparation or analysis of the proteins, as similar amounts of RNAP IIO and clathrin (a polypeptide of similar size) were observed on the same immunoblots (Fig. 6). (The amounts of these latter polypeptides were within the linear range of the assay.) We also investigated the effect of maribavir on accumulation of various forms of RNAP II. In the experiment shown in Fig. 6, maribavir treatment of wt-infected cells resulted in a very slight decrease (<twofold) in accumulation of RNAP IIi and IIA relative to untreated wt-infected cells.

Immunoblot analysis of RNAP II large subunit from HFF cells that were mock infected (M) or infected with wt HCMV strain AD169 (A) or RCD97 (R), in which UL97 is deleted, or with wt in the presence of 1 AM of the drug, maribavir (D) for 72 h. The top panel shows an immunoblot probed with ARNA3a that recognizes RNAP II large subunit regardless of phosphorylation state, the middle panel shows the blot probed with 8WG16, which does not recognize the hyperphosphorylated form (IIO), but recognizes less phosphorylated forms (hypophosphorylated, IIA, and intermediate forms, IIi), and the bottom panel with an antibody that recognizes clathrin. The positions of the various polypeptides are indicated to the right of the panels. All lanes contain extracts from the same number of cells.

However, in two other experiments, no difference was observed. Thus, the absence or inhibition of UL97 had, at most, a twofold effect on the accumulation of RNAP IIi and IIA induced by HCMV.

Discussion Our results show that wt HCMV infection induces a new pattern of RNAP II modification--the accumulation of intermediately migrating forms of RNAP II without depletion of the hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated forms ordinarily found in uninfected cells. These observations encouraged us to perform studies that showed that UL97 can phosphorylate RNAP II CTD in vitro, predominantly on Ser-5, but with a requirement for unphosphorylated Ser-2 residues. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a virally encoded protein kinase that can phosphorylate RNAP II CTD in vitro. This led us to test the hypothesis that UL97 is necessary for the pattern of RNAP II modification in infected cells. We found that this enzyme is not necessary although it might contribute. We discuss these findings below.

The positions of GSTUL97 and CTD peptide following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography are indicated in the top panel and the names and sequences of the peptides are indicated below.

HCMV induces a new pattern of RNAP II modification The pattern of RNAP II phosphorylation induced by HCMV both differs from and resembles those induced by other viruses. Unlike what we have observed with HCMV, HIV has not been reported to induce global changes in

RNAP II phosphorylation. Rather, it appears to recruit and activate CDK9/Cyclin T1 to transcription units containing trans-activation response elements, resulting in hyperphosphorylation of the CTD (reviewed in Taube et al., 1999). Thus, this mechanism is promoter-specific. Like HCMV, HSV induces global changes in RNAP II phosphorylation that involve the formation of intermediate-migrating forms (RNAP IIi). However, unlike the accumulation of both standard forms of RNAP II (IIA and IIO) that occurs during HCMV infection, HSV induces their depletion (Rice et al., 1994). The depletion of RNAP IIO has been correlated with repression of host cell transcription by HSV (Spencer et al., 1997). Consistent with this correlation, HCMV infection both induces RNAP IIO accumulation (this report) and host cell transcription (reviewed in Mocarski and Courcelle, 2001); this induction may also help explain the increases in amounts of RNAP IIA and O, and also clathrin (Figs. 1 and 6) during HCMV infection. It has been suggested that the depletion of RNAP IIO induced by HSV is due to a dissociation of TFIIE from RNAP II holoenzyme, because TFIIE stimulates CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH (Jenkins and Spencer, 2001). In this view, the formation of RNAP IIi could result in part from partial phosphorylation of CTD by TFIIH, as has been observed in vitro when TFIIH is stimulated by certain TFIIE mutants (Okamoto et al., 1998). The accumulation of RNAP IIO in HCMV-infected cells tends to argue against TFIIE dissociation alone explaining the formation of RNAP IIi in these cells. Regardless, the novel pattern of RNAP II modification that we have observed is likely to be important for gene expression in HCMV-infected cells. Phosphorylation of CTD by UL97 in vitro Our conclusion that UL97 can phosphorylate RNAP II and, specifically, its CTD in vitro rests on two important controls for specificity that ensure that phosphorylation is not due to other contaminating kinases: (1) The lack of activity of the catalytically inactive K355Q mutant protein that was purified in identical fashion and (2) sensitivity to the specific UL97 inhibitor, maribavir. The RNAP II CTD thus joins a small, but growing list of exogenous protein and peptide substrates that UL97 can phosphorylate in vitro (Baek et al., 2002a, 2002b; Krosky et al., 2003a). It is interesting to compare UL97 with CTD kinases that have been implicated in regulation of gene expression. As has been reported for the CDK7/cyclin H component of TFIIH (Gebara et al., 1997; Ramanathan et al., 2001; Roy et al., 1994; Trigon et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 2000), UL97 exhibits a preference for Ser-5 of the heptapeptide consensus sequence. UL97 can also phosphorylate Ser-2, albeit to a lesser extent. Ser-2 phosphorylation has been reported for the CDK9/cyclin T1 of P-TEFb, although there is disagreement in the literature regarding its extent (Kim et al., 2002; Ramanathan et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2000). It is worth emphasizing that we analyzed the sites of phosphorylation

directly, by sequencing phosphorylated CTD peptides, providing a quantitative assessment of their extents of phosphorylation. In contrast, most studies of TFIIH and P-TEFb kinases have used more indirect methods such as assessing the effects of substitutions at Ser-2 or Ser-5, or of antibodies that recognize phosphorylated Ser-2 or Ser-5. The specificity of such antibodies can be limited (Palancade and Bensaude, 2003). As observed with the TFIIH kinase, but not the P-TEFb kinase (Ramanathan et al., 2001), CTD peptides containing phosphorylated Ser-2 are poor substrates for UL97, despite the predominant phosphorylation of Ser-5. Interestingly, these three kinases are all inhibited by benzimidazole ribonucleosides-5,6, dichloro-h-D-ribosylbenzimidazole (DRB) CDK7/cyclin H and CDK9/cyclin T1 (Marshall et al., 1996; Yankulov et al., 1995), and maribavir in the case of UL97 (Baek et al., 2002b; Biron et al., 2002). DRB and maribavir differ only in substituents at the 2-position of the heterocycle and in the stereochemistry of the glycosidic bond. The CTD and CTD peptides differ from other substrates robustly phosphorylated by UL97 in that they lack a basic residue at the P + 5 position. We do not know what features of the CTD sequence account for its utilization by UL97. Previous results had indicated that unlike many kinases (Songyang et al., 1996), the P-3 residue had little importance for UL97 activity (Baek et al., 2002a, 2002b). Ser-2 is at the P-3 position relative to the predominant site of phosphorylation, Ser-5. This result suggests a negative effect of a phosphate at that position or at the P + 4 position. Alternatively, the phosphorylated peptide might be ``seen'' by the enzyme as a product, and is not phosphorylated. Does UL97 contribute to CTD phosphorylation in infected cells? Given that the UL97 null mutant still induced the formation of RNAP IIi and increased amounts of RNAP IIA relative to mock-infected cells, clearly UL97 plays at most a modest role in modification of RNAP II in HCMVinfected cells. The minimal effects of maribavir on formation of RNAP IIi suggest an even less important role. (The differences in RNAP II modification observed between mutant-infected vs. drug-treated, wt-infected cells could be due to several factors including greater penetrance of the mutant vs. the drug.) It is possible that UL97 does phosphorylate the CTD in infected HFF cells, but given the limited effects overall on RNAP II modification, this will be difficult to investigate further. It is also possible that UL97 might have a larger role in specific cell types, or, of course, that UL97 does not directly phosphorylate the CTD in any infected cells. In any event, inasmuch as UL97 is the only well-established HCMV-encoded protein kinase and as there is no evidence for a HCMV-encoded phosphatase, apparently the altered pattern of RNAP II modifications in HCMV-infected cells does not require a virus-encoded kinase or phosphatase.

This incomplete effect on RNAP II modification is similar, at least qualitatively, to what is observed following infection by an HSV mutant deficient in the UL13 protein kinase. Infection with either an HCMV UL97 mutant (this report) or an HSV UL13 mutant (Long et al., 1999) reduced, but did not abolish, accumulation of RNAP IIi without affecting the amount of RNAP IIO. However, with respect to RNAP IIA, opposite effects were observed: Infection with the HCMV UL97 mutant resulted in reduced formation of RNAP IIA, although infection with the HSV UL13 mutant resulted in more RNAP IIA than did infection with wt HSV. This latter observation led to the suggestion that at least some RNAP IIA is converted to RNAP IIi in HSV-infected cells, possibly by UL13 (Long et al., 1999). The simplest interpretation of our data is that UL97 does not convert RNAP IIA to IIi. To explain why there is reduced formation of RNAP IIA in UL97 mutant-infected cells, a more complicated interpretation starts with the assumption that UL97 directly does phosphorylate RNAP II in HCMV-infected cells. If so, as prior phosphorylation of CTD peptides on either Ser-2 or Ser-5 precludes further phosphorylation, UL97 would be expected to phosphorylate IIA relatively lightly, resulting not only in IIi species but also in even less phosphorylated forms that comigrate with IIA. Thus, both IIi and IIA would appear to be diminished in the absence of UL97. However, this pattern could be due to indirect effects. UL97 is very important for productive infection by HCMV, but its role is controversial. Studies of maribavir (Biron et al., 2002), RCD97 (Wolf et al., 2001), or both (Krosky et al., 2003b) have indicated that UL97 is most important for DNA synthesis, capsid assembly, or nuclear egress, respectively. Additionally, UL97 has been shown to phosphorylate the viral polymerase accessory protein, UL44, in vitro and to be essential for its normal phosphorylation in infected cells (Krosky et al., 2003a). Regardless of these findings and the only modest role of UL97 in RNAP II modification, the similarities of UL97 to two cellular kinases involved in transcriptional elongation, and to HSV UL13, continue to provoke the speculation that UL97 plays a role in gene expression. Although UL97 is not required for the efficient expression of certain viral genes in HFF cells (Krosky et al., 2003b; Prichard et al., 1999; Wolf et al., 2001), it could conceivably enhance the expression of other viral genes, host genes, or both, which might in turn enhance virus replication, in these or other cells. Further studies of the effects of UL97 mutations on host and viral gene expression may be warranted.

Cells and viruses Human foreskin fibroblast cells (HFFs) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM, Clontech) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals). Cells were subcultured every 2­ 3 days and screened monthly for mycoplasma contamination by PCR. HCMV wild type (wt) was also obtained from ATCC. The UL97 null mutant virus (RCD97), which contains an insertion encoding the E. coli lacZ and gpt genes that replaces most of the UL97 open reading frame (Prichard et al., 1999), was provided generously by Mark Prichard. Viral stocks were prepared and titered as previously described (Turk et al., 1987). Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells, obtained from ATCC, were maintained in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 Ag/ml streptomycin B. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing wild-type or mutant K355Q glutathione-S-transferase (GST) ­ UL97 fusion proteins (He et al., 1997) were propagated and maintained on Sf9 cells by standard methods (Crossen and Gruenwald, 1998). Western blot analysis HFF cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight at 37 jC. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of one plaque forming unit per cell in DMEM with 5% FBS for 2 h (inocula titers were checked by back titration). Inocula were removed and the cells were washed 2 times with DMEM with 5% FBS. DMEM and 5% FBS, with or without 1 AM maribavir, was then added and incubation at 37 jC continued for the indicated times post-infection (p.i.). At selected times, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and either immediately lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, or harvested with 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS, collected by centrifugation (5 min at 1000g at 4 jC), and lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. In some experiments, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 1 and 2 were included during lysis. The same results were obtained with or without these inhibitors. For studies of the phosphatase sensitivity of RNAP IIi species, cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris ­ HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation at 18 000 Â g for 30 min at 4 jC and dialyzed against lambda phosphatase buffer (50 mM Tris ­ HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT) supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail. Fifteen microliters of dialyzed lysate was either incu-

bated on ice or incubated at 30 jC either alone or with 400 units of lambda protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Proteins in lysates were separated through 6% SDSPAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 100 V for 3 h. The following antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis: 8WG16 (Thompson et al., 1990), kindly provided by Charlotte Spencer or purchased from Biodesign International (diluted 1:1000 ­ 10 000); ARNA 3a (Kramer et al., 1980) from Research Diagnostics, Inc (1:1000); horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse from Amersham (1:25 000 ­ 50 000); anti-clathrin HC from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., (1:15 000); HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat from Santa Cruz (1:50 000). Membranes were blocked with Super Block (Pierce) or with 5% nonfat dry milk (BioRad) dissolved in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, developed with SuperSignalWest Femto substrate (Pierce), and stripped with Restore (Pierce) or with a solution of 62.5 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mM hÀmercaptoethanol, before reprobing. All products were used as described in the package insert, except that membranes were blocked overnight at 4 jC. Dilutions of extracts were analyzed to ensure that detection signals were within the linear ranges of the assays. Purification of baculovirus-expressed GST-UL97 and E. coli-expressed GST-CTD Baculovirus-expressed GST-UL97 and GST-UL97K355Q were purified as detailed previously (Baek et al., 2002a). To purify GST-CTD, overnight cultures of E. coli (DH5a) expressing GST fused to the yeast RNAP II CTD (Cho et al., 1997), a kind gift from E.-J. Cho and S. Buratowski, were diluted 10-fold in fresh Luria broth containing 100 Ag/ml ampicillin and grown for 1 h before addition of 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-h-D-galactopyranoside. After 4 h of induction, cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml glutathione-sepharose column. The column was washed with 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol, and the GST-CTD was eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione. The resulting protein was apparently homogeneous based on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and was stored at À80 jC. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis performed by Angelo Dickerson at the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Peptides CTD peptide, which consists of three YSPTSPS repeats, was purchased from Research Genetics. Peptides CTD4-WT (four YSPTSPS repeats), CTD4-S2P (same as WT except

Ser-2 is phosphorylated), CTD4-S5P (same as WT except Ser-5 is phosphorylated), and CTD4-S2P/S5P (same as WT except Ser-2 and Ser-5 are phosphorylated) were generous gifts from Cho et al. (2001). The sequences were verified by laser desorption mass spectroscopy and the concentrations of each solution were quantified by amino acid analysis by James Lee and Angelo Dickerson, respectively, at the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Protein kinase assays In vitro phosphorylations were performed in kinase buffer (50 mM Tris ­HCl, pH 9.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 5 AM ATP), with 5 ACi g-32P ATP at >5000 Ci/mmol (ICN), wild type or mutant GST-UL97 (100 ng) or yeast TFIIH (100 ng; generously provided by E. Cho and S. Buratowski) and, as substrate, either yeast RNAP II (150 ng; Cho et al., 1997) generously provided by E.-J. Cho and S. Buratowski, GST-CTD (200 ng), synthetic CTD peptide (10 Ag), or one of the CTD-4 peptides (final concentration of 30 AM). The reactions were incubated at 37 jC for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 6Â SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min and were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE (yeast RNAP II) or 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE (GST-CTD and various CTD peptides). Phosphoamino acid analysis Kinase reactions were performed as described above with GST-CTD (10 Ag) or CTD peptide (10 Ag). After 10% SDSPAGE, the GST-CTD was extracted as described previously for GST-UL97 (He et al., 1997), and phosphorylated synthetic CTD peptide was isolated from a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel as described previously for extraction of tryptic peptides from alkaline acrylamide gels (Baek et al., 2002b). One-dimensional electrophoretic separation of amino acids was performed subsequent to acid hydrolysis as described previously (Baek et al., 2002b). Amino acid standards were visualized with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone, and radioactivity was detected by autoradiography. Identification of phosphorylation sites by amino acid sequence analysis CTD peptide that had been phosphorylated in vitro was coupled to Immobilon-AA (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sequencing was performed by James Lee of the Molecular Biology Core Facility, DanaFarber Cancer Institute, using previously described methods (Baek et al., 2002b). An in-line split diverted a portion of each sequencing cycle to a fraction collector to determine 32 P content by liquid scintillation counting, the remaining portion was employed for residue identification by reversedphase high performance liquid chromatography.
