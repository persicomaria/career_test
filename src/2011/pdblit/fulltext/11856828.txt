Description of ordered solvent molecules in a Ê platinated decanucleotide duplex refined at 1.6 A resolution against experimental MAD phases
Accurate experimental phases derived from a MAD experiment may be useful to enable the identi®cation of solvent molecules during the course of an atomic parameter re®nement. The structure of a double-stranded DNA decaÊ nucleotide bearing a cisplatin interstrand cross-link at 1.6 A resolution, whose phases were ®rst determined experimentally using the LIII edge of the Pt atom, was re®ned by various methods. The previously published structure resulted from a least-squares re®nement using the structure-factor magnitudes and stereochemical restraints (program SHELX). In this paper, these previous results are compared with a model obtained by the likelihood-maximization method (program REFMAC) which allows the combination of the observed magnitudes with experimental MAD phases. This solution corresponded to a lower Rfree (18.8 compared with 20.3%), a lower R factor and accounted for 135 water molecules and one spermine molecule collected by the program wARP during re®nement. The previously published SHELX solution exhibited no spermine molecule and accounted for 92 water molecules, only 74 of which are also present in the model obtained with the MAD phases. In order to verify that these improvements were actually related to the use of the MAD phases, the same type of procedure without the MAD phases was applied starting from the initial model. The resulting solution had a higher Rfree (20.3%), which could be related to the loss of 22 water molecules and the addition of 20 new ones. MAD phases therefore seem especially helpful in preventing the model bias which may affect the solvent molecules. All models have in common a hydration cage of nine water molecules which surround the platinum residue. In addition to the spermine molecule, the model obtained with the MAD phases allows description of the water-molecule organization, with reproducible motifs related to the base pairs and to the phosphodiester backbone.

1. Introduction
In macromolecular crystallography, the number of measured intensities is often insuf®cient to re®ne the individual atomic parameters reliably and/or accurately when the diffraction data does not reach atomic resolution. Usually, the experimental diffraction data must be supplemented with chemical information in the form of stereochemical constraints or the minimization of the internal energy of the molecule in order to improve the balance between the number of observations and the number of unknown parameters to re®ne. However, accurate stereochemical information is lacking for the ordered solvent molecules which are associated with the macromolecular structures. To date, there is little means available to

cross-linked DNA molecule to be assigned unambiguously enable distinction between features caused by ordered solvent (Fig. 1). The model was re®ned conventionally (i.e. against molecules and those re¯ecting errors of experimental origin or scattered magnitudes only) with SHELX97 (Sheldrick, 1997) arising from model bias. In 1996, Burling and coworkers and 92 water molecules could be identi®ed from ' A-weighted included in a least-squares re®nement the minimization of the difference (mFo À DFc) maps using the program ARP differences between the computed structure-factor phases and (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993).

This could explain the instability of this particular meters than in the re®nement without the experimental adduct under physiological conditions (Perez et al., 1997). In phases. This new re®nement allowed the identi®cation of this paper, we describe the results of a new re®nement of the many ordered solvent molecules as well as partially ordered model, using the program REFMAC (version 4.0; Collaborasolvent shells.

We discuss the stereochemical improve the accuracy of the macromolecular model, especially information drawn from the water molecules determined by when the scattering limit of the crystals does not approach the new re®nement with MAD phases and included in the atomic resolution.

2.2. Structure determination

Determination of the structure-factor phases was performed with the program SHARP (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997), taking !4 magnitudes (high-energy remote) as the native data set (pseudo-MIR method). After convergence, high ®gures of merit (overall FOM = 0.84 and Ê FOM = 0.77 in the 1.74±1.63 A resolution shell) and phasingpower values (overall, 5.1 for the high-energy remote amplitudes and 8.6 for the peak) were obtained. The MAD electron-density map is unambiguously interpretable at the atomic level. Solvent ¯attening (SOLOMON; Abrahams & Leslie, 1996), however, yielded a map with a higher contrast, which was used to build the initial model. The O atoms of the phosphate groups have distinct density maxima and all the bond angles are clearly de®ned for all non-H atoms of the macromolecule. An example of the quality of this initial map superimposed with the re®ned atomic model is given in Fig. 1 for one of the GÁC base pairs.

Table 1

The initial model built with TURBO-FRODO v.5.5 (Roussel & Cambillau, 1991) gave an R factor of 32%. A ®rst model re®nement based on structure-factor amplitudes only was performed with SHELX97. Alternate sets of least-squares re®nement cycles and analysis of ' A-type weighted difference maps (2mFo À DFc and mFo À DFc) using ARP led to the localization of 92 water molecules. These water molecules had densities above 1' and were checked for hydrogen-bond stereochemistry consistency. For the last cycles of re®nement, anisotropic temperature factors were re®ned for both the backbone P and Pt atoms (2091 individual parameters, 407 restrained atoms, 92 unrestrained atoms). In this re®nement, the ®nal R and Rfree factors were 16.92 and 20.32%, respectively. Other statistics are given in Table 1. To take advantage of the high quality of the MAD phases, a second re®nement was undertaken using REFMAC. In this we used the MAD phases derived from the program SHARP with their corresponding probabilities given by the Hendrickson± Lattman coef®cients. Furthermore, the solvent ¯attening is able to introduce a bias whose effects would be opposite to the collection of ordered solvent molecules. Indeed, we estimated that the initial phases from SHARP have a more straightforward physical meaning than the phases derived from SOLOMON, which depend on the de®nition of a mask, itself subjected to possible errors. This program has the option of including in the re®nement not only the observed moduli and the constraints of the bond distances and angles, but also the structure-factor phases of any origin provided that they are associated with individual probabilities. The minimization method used was based upon gradient minimization associated with maximum-likelihood ranking. The use of the MAD phases is equivalent to augmenting the number of structurefactor observations with an equal number of experimental values which are generally less accurately known than the magnitudes (we suppose that the probability functions associated with the MAD phases are well represented by the

Hendrickson±Lattman coef®cients). The initial unre®ned model of the cross-linked DNA molecule was taken as a starting point for this new re®nement and did not include any solvent molecules. Stereochemical restraints were applied to all non-H atoms from the DNA molecule and isotropic thermal parameters were re®ned for all atoms. When the R factor reached the value of 22%, we began to add solvent molecules located as before in ' A-type weighted difference maps from the program wARP (2mFo À DFc and mFo À DFc). After several steps of re®nement and introduction of water molecules in the model, we identi®ed a continuous stretch of density in which we could build 12 of the 14 atoms of a spermine molecule. A total of 135 putative water molecule O atoms have been included in the last re®nement cycles as well as the partially built spermine molecule. The results of this re®nement using experimentally derived phases (REFMAC/ MLKMAD) and its comparison with the more conventional re®nement (SHELX) are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2.

Although anisotropic temperature factors were not applied to the P and Pt atoms in the REFMAC re®nement, the R and Rfree factors are lower than those resulting from the SHELX re®nement (R = 16.0% compared with 17.0%; Rfree = 18.6 compared with 20.3%). In addition, the average of the indiÊ vidual B factors decreases from 18 to 15 A2 for the DNA molecule. The B factors of the two re®nements can be compared in Fig. 3. This difference in B factors has an effect on the apparent resolution of the maps. With the experimental MAD phases and with the SOLOMON phases, the purine rings have shapes where each valence angle can be identi®ed (Fig. 1), whereas surprisingly with the SHELX phases, the corresponding rings exhibit holes of a smaller size for the hexagonal moieties and have a smoother appearance. As in the ®rst re®nement, all occupancy ratios for the solvent molecules were set to 100%. The atomic coordinates for the Ê cross-linked DNA had an r.m.s. displacement of 0.11 A with respect to the SHELX model. The strongest shifts, which occur for the phosphate O atoms, are partly a consequence of the fact that anisotropic thermal parameters were not used for the P atoms in this case. Fig. 2 gives a comparative analysis of discrepancies between the different sets of phases (for simplicity, we denote the conventional SHELX97 re®nement as the SHELX model, the REFMAC re®nement with phases as the REFMAC model, the initial phases from SHARP before solvent ¯attening as MAD phases and those resulting from solvent ¯attening as the SOLOMON phases). The phase differences between the two re®ned models vary from 13 to 18 (average 16 ). For the REFMAC re®nement the differences from the experimental Ê Ê phases vary from 26 (2.7 A resolution) to 40 (1.6 A resolution) and the average discrepancy is 30.5 . For the SHELX re®nement, the extrema are 28 and 40 and the average is 32 . We notice that the (REFMAC À experimental) phase differences curve is systematically below the (SHELX À experiÊ mental) curve, except for the 1.66 A shell. Furthermore, the REFMAC phases are closer to those derived from SOLOMON than the SHELX phases by an average of 2 . This is interesting, as the SOLOMON phases correspond to a map corrected for errors in the cell volume occupied by the bulk solvent and have not contributed to the re®nement. However, Ê we may notice that beyond 1.75 A all the slopes of the difference curves increase signi®cantly and this may mean that experimental MAD and SOLOMON phases become less accurate. This is not surprising as the resolution limits are Ê Ê 1.72 A for the low-energy remote data, 1.69 A for the peak Ê for the high-energy remote and and in¯exion data, and 1.63 A the corresponding Rsym values are higher (Coste et al., 1999).
2.4. Identification of water molecules

The water molecules were identi®ed automatically by the program ARP from (mFo À DFc) and (2mFo À DFc) maps with phases computed from the atomic model after each range of re®nement cycles. Afterwards, the density of each new solvent molecule was inspected visually and then included de®nitively into the atomic model only if its hydrogen-bonding stereochemistry is sensible and its B factors re®ned below Ê 50 A2. A total of 18 water molecules from the SHELX model are absent from the MLKMAD list and 74 water molecules (identi®ed after the visual inspection of the list of atoms sorted according to one of the atomic parameters) are common to both models. Since it was not possible to relate the water molecules from the SHELX model to characteristic patterns (except for the water molecules in contact with the platinum residue), it is dif®cult to relate these 18 water molecules to speci®c interactions. On the contrary, in the case of the MLKMAD model it has been possible to relate the ordered water molecules to reproducible interactions along the DNA molecule. We may therefore suspect that the 18 solvent molecules removed from the SHELX model were a consequence of model bias and that the addition of the 61 new water molecules helped to propose logical descriptions for the hydration patternslloyd

In the course of the re®nement process, a continuous stretch of density appeared in an area close to the extrahelical cytosine C16. The program ARP tentatively interpreted this electron density as a cluster of water molecules. However, owing to the close contacts the density could not be properly modelled as a cluster of water molecules. We veri®ed that the map could convincingly accommodate 12 non-H

the interpretation of the results is that the re®nements performed with SHELX and REFMAC did not involve the same number of atomic parameters for the DNA molecule. In SHELX the possibility has been implemented of re®ning the anisotropic thermal parameters for speci®ed atoms only, which is not the case with REFMAC. The question of the number of solvent molecules which may arti®cially improve the re®nements could also be raised. As we pointed out in the introduction, we are aware of two main criteria which are not 2.6. REFMAC refinements based on structure-factor magnitudes only and/or without stereochemical restraints completely independent in checking the quality of the structure re®nement: (i) being able to assign a maximum number of Since SHELX and REFMAC are different programs using solvent molecules on the basis of an automatic analysis of the different minimization methods to re®ne the atomic models, electron density in the course of the re®nement and (ii) the question of the origin of the improvements obtained with avoiding the possibility that this electron density is biased by REFMAC must be addressed. More precisely, the use of the model. The program REFMAC allowed us to compare two likelihood ranking might improve the model by itself re®nements performed in parallel with and without the MAD according to our criteria. Another fact which may complicate phases by maximum-likelihood ranking. The corresponding re®nement statistics are given in Table 1. The Rfree factor is higher by 1.5% when MAD phases are omitted, whereas the R factors have comparable values. The mean thermal parameters have intermediate values between the SHELX and MLKMAD re®nements. The examination of the set of solvent molecules shows that the two solutions have 115 water molecules and the partially occupied spermine molecule in common. Conversely, 22 water molecules from the MLKMAD model are absent from the MLK model and 20 other water molecules present in the MLK model are absent in the MLKMAD model. Now, if we start from the MLKMAD model and re®ne it without the MAD phases, it remains stable and the R factors are even better than with the MLKMAD re®nement (data not shown). This means that the MLKMAD solution is also compatible with the structure-factor magnitudes alone when re®ned with the MLK conditions. Conversely, if the MLK procedure is replaced by the classical least-squares option, 15 water molecules disappear from a (2Fo À Fc) map and the spermine molecule is altered. Editing these solvent molecules would probably converge towards the SHELX solution. Another means to check the relative contributions of likelihood ranking versus use of MAD phases, lies in the comparison of the DNA atomic models corresponding to the different re®nement procedures (MLKMAD, MLK, LSQ) in the absence of stereochemical restraints. This comparison (Table 2) shows that MLKMAD shifts are the smallest and LSQ ones the largest. R.m.s., mean and maximum shifts for the MLK procedure are approximately halfFigure 4 way between MLKMAD and LSQ.

3. Structural and biological importance of the ordered solvent molecules
At the end of the re®nement process based on the experimental values of the structure-factor moduli and phases, 135 solvent molecules and one partial spermine molecule involved in intermolecular contacts have been identi®ed. The solvent molecules were assigned in the ®rst instance as water molecules. The chemical nature of the solvent molecules and ions present in the crystals are given in the crystallization conditions. The K+ ions (30 mM) and the ClÀ ions (35 mM) cannot in principle be confused with water molecules because of their putative high electron density. Only Na+ ions (25 mM) could be confused for water molecules as they have the same number of electrons. The question of the possible attribution of solvent peaks to Na+ ions has been discussed recently in the case of the structure of the Drew±Dickerson dodecamer (Shui et al., 1998; Chiu et al., 1999). We applied the equation of Brown & Wu (1976) to identify possible cation sites (WASP program; Nayal & Di Cera, 1996), but we did not obtain any clear results for the presence of Na+ ions (data not shown). For the substitution of water molecules by K+ ions, six sites have valence strengths larger than 1. However, the corresponding atoms re®ned as oxygen have large B values and the corresponding densities were not convincing for fully occupied K+ sites. We therefore consider all the well resolved single solvent peaks to represent O atoms from water molecules. With respect to the SHELX re®nement, the ratio of water molecules per nucleotide increases from 4.5, which is the average number found for 15 B-DNA molecules in the PDB by Schneider et al. (1998), to 6.9, in spite of the suppression of 18 water molecules from the SHELX model. Of the 74 water molecules occupying similar positions, only those surrounding the platinum residue seemed to belong to a well de®ned motif. Conversely, the water molecules of the REFMAC model exhibit four different regions of interaction: with the platinum residue in the minor groove, with the Watson±Crick base pairs, with the phosphodiester backbone and between neighbouring symmetry-related molecules. The interactions with the platinum residue have been already well described (Coste et al., 1999) and are conserved in the REFMAC model. One water molecule bound to an N atom of an ammine group

Ê undergoes a displacement of about 1 A, which gives a more symmetrical shape to the cage surrounding the platinum coordination sphere with respect to the platinum coordination plane. These results from the new re®nement using experimentally derived phases now allow an exhaustive description of the interactions of other solvent molecules.
3.1. Hydration of the Watson±Crick base pairs.

On the basis of structural models deposited in the NDB, Schneider et al. (1992, 1993), Berman (1994, 1997) and Auf®nger & Westhof (2000) proposed some general rules and gave averaged patterns of hydration for the two different types of standard Watson±Crick base pairs. In the case described in this paper, some parts of the DNA molecule have different conformations not representative of the classical B-DNA structure, such as the cytosines C5 and C16 that extend into the solvent and the complementary guanines cross-linked to the platinum moiety. These large distortions modify the arrangement of the water molecules in the vicinity of the lesion only. However, the other base pairs shown in Fig. 5 display strong similarities to the standard patterns given in the reviews cited above. If we exclude the terminal base pairs C1ÁG20 (which makes a triplet with C6 from another molecule)

and C10ÁG11, the three other GÁC pairs are quite similar, especially in the major groove which does not contain the platinum residue. For less disturbed parts of the DNA molecule, the atoms N7, O6 and O2 of the guanines are always bound to a water molecule. The N3 positions of the purines as well as the 2 and 4 positions of the pyrimidines are also hydrated (except for the terminal GÁC pairs). All these O atoms from water molecules lie close to the mean plane of the Watson±Crick base pairs and follow the propeller twist. In the three AÁT base pairs, the N6 of A12 is hydrated as well as the N7 of A14 and A18. The heterocyclic O4 from the three T nucleotides (T3, T7 and T9) are hydrated. The pair T7ÁA14 is close to the lesion and O2 of T7 makes a hydrogen bond with one of the ammine groups of the platinum residue instead of a water molecule. This speci®city is related to a shift of the water molecule bound to N3 of A14.
3.2. Hydration of the phosphodiester backbone

While the hydration of DNA base pairs is well documented, the hydration of the phosphodiester backbone is less well known. Nonetheless, the hydration of the phosphate groups is of particular importance in the overall stabilization and in the transitions of nucleic acids from one polymorph to another (Saenger et al., 1986). In B-DNA, no regular hydration patterns at neighbouring phosphate groups have been observed while water molecules bridging two O(II) atoms are frequently seen in A-DNA crystal structures (Schneider et al., 1998; Wahl & Sundaralingam, 1997). Our REFMAC re®nement reveals a regular pattern of water molecules along the two strands of the phosphodiester backbone in the areas where the double-helical structure is conserved and in the absence of intermolecular contacts (Fig. 6). Indeed, the O(II) atom at the 5H side of a nucleotide is linked to the O(I) atom of the phosphate at the 3H side by two consecutive water molecules. When the nucleotides are not in standard B conformation, there may be a linkage between two successive O(II) atoms or by a single water molecule. The linkage by two water molecules could be a characteristic of B-DNA. Egli et al. (1996) describes an RNA with consecutive O(I) phosphates bridged by a single water molecule. In a recent molecular-dynamics study (Auf®nger & Westhof, 2000), several adjacent phosphate groups of a RNA duplex were bridged by one water molecule. However, it is interesting to note that in the same study no long-lived water bridge was Figure 6 found between the major-groove phosphate Stereo pairs for (a) the upper and (b) the lower phosphodiester backbone strands (blue) and groups of a B-DNA duplex. It seems that hydrogen-bond linked water molecules (red). Figure generated by MOLSCRIPT and Raster3D. the phosphate±phosphate distance and the

hydration of phosphate groups are directly related (Saenger et al., 1986). The type of nesting between adjacent phosphates found in this platinated DNA molecule seems to exclude the presence of monovalent cations close to the phosphate groups. More particularly, the coordination of these solvent peaks is not characteristic of a monovalent cation and these sites were not identi®ed by the equation of Brown & Wu (1976). The cations are probably present in the bulk solvent and the negative charge of the phosphate groups may be dislocated between the different O atoms including those of the water molecule bridge. This network of water molecules bound to the phosphate moieties of the phosphodiester backbone shields the deoxyribose moieties and especially protects the 3H and 5H ester functions against hydrolysis.
3.3. Intermolecular contacts

In the case of crystals of oligonucleotide crystals, the stacking of terminal base pairs mimics the continuity of the double helix, ensuring the crystal cohesion in one direction. In our case, a twofold axis is close to both terminal base pairs, so each terminal base pair (C10ÁG11 and C1ÁG20) stacks with the same base pair from a neighbouring molecule (Coste et al., 1999). In the case of the C1ÁG20 pair, a triplet is also formed with the extra-helical cytosine C6 from another molecule, ensuring the cohesion in a direction perpendicular to the mean double-helix axis. The extra-helical cytosine C16 interacts at the side opposite to C6 with a C1 phosphate group from another molecule. Some putative water molecules are also involved in close contacts in the area of the extra-helical cytosine C6. Interestingly, Wa3 and Wa4 form a bridge between two phosphate groups: the O(II) from nucleotide 5 from one molecule and the O(I) from the nucleotide 4 of an adjacent molecule (Fig. 7). This interaction seems to reproduce the type of nesting which has been found between two successive phosphate groups of the same strand. Wa3 and Wa4 have low B values for water Ê molecules (about 12 A2), but their coordination number is too

small for a metal ion. Wa3 is also involved with Wa60 in an intramolecular bridge between two successive phosphate groups. The contacts of the spermine molecule are shown in Fig. 4(b). The distance between the two secondary amine groups (N5 and N10) is close to that of two successive phosphodiester groups (C2 and T3) and they form hydrogen bonds with the O(I) of residues C2 and T3. The spermine molecule shields the phosphodiester backbone in a way similar to the nesting of the water molecules which form intramolecular bridges. The N5 secondary amine group is also hydrogen bonded to Wa90, which is itself linked to the O(II) of residue G17 from another molecule. Here we again have a succession of two hydrogen-bond linkers which connect two phosphate groups from different molecules. The terminal primary amine from the spermine molecule N14 is hydrogen bonded to the O2 oxygen moiety from the extra-helical cytosine C16 which precedes the G17 residue involved in the interaction with Wa90. The N1 primary amine moiety of the spermine molecule is not visible in the electron-density maps and is probably disordered owing to the absence of any strong interactions.

4. Discussion
4.1. Refinement technique

Ê A MAD experiment at 1.6 A resolution around the Pt LIII absorption edge of a crystallized double-stranded decanucleotide bearing a cisplatin interstrand cross-link allowed us to determine accurate phases related to the prior determination of the Pt-atom position. The re®nement of the atomic model by minimization of the mean-square error between the calculated structure factors and the phased observed amplitudes led to atomic parameters for the DNA molecule close to those resulting from a re®nement performed with the observed moduli only. However, the atomic thermal paraÊ meters are signi®cantly lower (3 A2) for the SHELX re®nement when the MAD phases are used and this resulted in an increased contribution of the highresolution re¯ections to the computation of the maps and a more accurate model. The main interest in such a procedure to re®ne macromolecular crystal structures lies in the identi®cation of solvent molecules, because the difference maps from which such molecules are collected are less subjected to model bias. In fact, it would be much better to compute a map resulting from a combination of the MAD phases with those computed from the model, with a proper weighting of each source of information. Such a weighting would require a rigorous Figure 7 statistical treatment which is beyond Stereo pair showing the water linkage between two neighbouring DNA molecules.

Ê we showed that even at 1.6 A resolution and with the use of an improved model only to compute the phases, the collection of solvent molecules surrounding the macromolecule yields results strikingly different than in the case of the traditional re®nement method. In our case, 18 water molecules (of the 92 found after the re®nement without the MAD phases) were removed, whereas 61 new water molecules have been added to the list. In addition, partially occupied atomic positions have been found for a spermine molecule. Since these solvent molecules may be important in the discussion of such topics as the recognition mechanism between macromolecules, enzymatic mechanisms, folding mechanism of proteins, oligomeric proteins assembly and crystallization processes, the reliability of their identi®cation and location is of biological importance. Until now, although some researchers have scanned the databases to point out some interesting features related to solvent molecules, little work has been performed to check the reliability of this part of the data. Since the number of structures determined with MAD techniques, with Se labelling and with data from a unique crystal is increasing, it would be rewarding to generalize the use of MAD phases in re®nement whatever the resolution. Of course, when atomic resolution is reached by the diffraction data, MAD phases are probably not mandatory. However, they regardless provide a means to verify the reliability of the solvent-molecule assignments by checking their stability during the re®nement process. The use of maximum-likelihood ranking without the MAD phases is able to improve the model signi®cantly. Indeed, the MLK re®nement (see Tables 1 and 2) and the examination of the corresponding difference maps indicate that the quality of the re®nement is intermediate between SHELX and MLKMAD. The water molecules which disappear are peripheral ones, particularly those related to the phosphodiester backbone. It has not been possible to check with the program REFMAC a combination of the use of the MAD phases and the classical least-squares method as this possibility was not operational. Anyway, in the absence of stereochemical restraints, the use of MAD phases combined with likelihood ranking is able to maintain the atoms of the DNA molecules at relevant positions, better than likelihood ranking alone. This fact suggests that accurate MAD phases have played an important role in terms of the overdetermination of the parameters of the atomic model and would be able to help solving the problem of model bias at non-atomic resolution. The use of experimental phases was ®rst proposed by Ê Burling et al. (1996) in a 1.8 A resolution study of a protein. We used a similar approach to study the hydration of a DNA molecule at a higher resolution. In our case, conspicuous biochemical information has been derived from the identi®cation of solvent molecules included in the DNA structure.

limitations have to be considered: (i) the crystallization mother liquor generally includes many components in addition to water, which may complicate the interpretation of the map features attributed to solvent or (ii) modify the structure of the hydration shell with respect to what occurs in the cellular medium and (iii) the intermolecular contacts which are speci®c to the crystal lattice are also able to interfere with the primary hydration layer. Nevertheless, the crystallographic analysis of the solvent±DNA interaction provides a unique opportunity to understand some aspects of the crystallization process at the atomic level and relate it to thermodynamic considerations. In this study, two aspects of the hydration patterns are related to the speci®city of the DNA molecule: the interactions with the DNA bases and the interactions with the platinum moiety. GÁC and AÁT base pairs display different hydration patterns. These patterns are modulated by the sequence context and/or the conformation of the DNA molecule. In our case, standard patterns are less affected by the distortions induced by the cross-link in the major groove than in the minor groove, where the adduct protrudes. This can be veri®ed for the pairs G13ÁC8, G17ÁC4 and G19ÁC2, for which the hydration pattern displays three different arrangements at the minor-groove side and only one at the majorgroove side. The positions N7, O6, N2 of guanine residues and the positions N4 and O2 of cytosine are always hydrated in these three pairs. The pairs G11ÁC10 and G20ÁC1 are involved in intermolecular contacts, including the formation of a triplet (G20ÁC1), and cannot be considered further. In AÁT pairs, the N7 position of adenine is hydrated in A18ÁT3 and A14ÁT7, whereas for A12ÁT9 the corresponding water molecule is shifted toward N6. For the three AÁT pairs, the N4 from thymine is always hydrated. In the minor groove, the N3 from adenine is always hydrated, whereas the O2 interacts with a water molecule in T9 and T3 and in T7 it is hydrogen bonded to an ammine group from the cisplatin adduct.
4.3. The role of solvent molecules in the cohesion of the crystals

Macromolecular crystallography now allows detailed description of the interaction between proteins or nucleic acids and the ordered solvent molecules. However, three

Spermine molecules have been dif®cult to identify in crystals of nucleic acids, although they are frequently required for crystallization. To date, a partial spermine molecule (seven of the 14 atoms) has been located in only one B-DNA crystal structure (Shui et al., 1998). A possible explanation of this dif®culty in seeing the spermine is that polyamines play the

same role as cations in the non-speci®c shielding of the charged phosphate groups. This type of ionic interaction is less stable than hydrogen bonding and is subject to disorder. According to the results of a recent molecular-dynamics simulation, the highly ¯exible spermine molecules do not form structurally stable complexes with B-DNA (Korolev et al., 2001). In our case, the spermine molecule has an extended conformation, enabling two of its amino groups to interact with two consecutive phosphates. The spermine interacts also with the extra-helical cytosine C16 in a non-ionic fashion and with the G17 phosphate group from another molecule. It seems that for the ®rst time in a nucleic acid crystal a clear connection has been found between the requirement for spermine in crystallization and its role in crystal cohesion. Interestingly, the required concentration of spermine in the mother liquor is not high compared with other oligonucleotide crystals (2.5 mM); neither is that of the precipitating agent (2.5% MPD). In these crystals, the extra-helical cytosine residues are essential to link together the molecules in a direction perpendicular to the double-helix axis. Consistently, the spermine molecule helps to establish this interaction with the cytosine C16 which is not involved in a triplet formation like the cytosine C6.

5. Conclusions
The use of MAD phases to enhance the strength of a structure Ê re®nement at 1.6 A, combined with likelihood maximization, allowed determination of structural details at the boundary of the molecule, which are dif®cult to model even at this resolution. In nucleic acid biochemistry, knowledge of the structure of the ordered solvent molecules is essential to understand the interactions of these molecules with drugs and proteins. Experimental MAD phases could also be used to investigate the relationship between a given nucleic acid sequence and the structure of the ordered solvent shell systematically. Such experiments would require further progress in nucleic acid synthesis to incorporate strong anomalous scatterers at chosen positions within the DNA molecule and with minimal disturbance of the solvent shell.
