Abstract
We present the analysis of the activities towards soluble and insoluble substrates of seven cellulases cloned from the saprophytic fungus Humicolu insolens. The activity on the soluble polymer substrate carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was used to determine the pH activity profiles of the five endoglucanases (EG), whereas cellotriose and reduced cellohexaose were used to determine the pH activity profiles of cellobiohydrolase I (CBH) and CBH II. All the EGs show optimal activity between pH 7 and 8.5, while CBH I and CBH II peak around pH 5.5 and 9, respectively. The catalytic activities of five of these cellulases were investigated under neutral and alkaline conditions using reduced cellohexaose as a substrate in a cellobiose oxidase coupled assay. EG I and CBH I both belong to family (7) according to a recent classification of glycosyl hydrolases. They both have activity against cellotriose. Therefore, they were studied using a coupled assay involving glucose oxidase. The activity on insoluble substrate (phosphoric-acid swollen cellulose) was assessed by the formation of reducing groups. The presence of a cellulose binding domain (CBD) lowers the apparent KM. This can be explained by the dispersing action of CBD. However, the CBD also reduces the apparent k,,, probably by slowing down the mobility. EG I. EG II and EG III show similar activity towards CMC and amorphous cellulose, while EG V, EG VI, CBH I and CBH II have the highest catalytic rate on amorphous cellulose. In summary, Humicolu insolens possesses a battery of cellulose-degrading enzymes which cooperate in the efficient hydrolysis of cellulose. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Cellulose, a polymer of ,8-1,6linked glucose residues, is one of the most abundant naturally produced compounds on the planet. Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is catalyzed by a number of cellulases, which have been classified as CBH and

EG. CBHs are characterized by producing predominantly cellobiose from insoluble cellulose and having very low activity on CMC; in contrast, EGs are endocellulases which can lower the vicosity of a CMC solution. Most cellulolytic microorganisms produce many different cellulases. A special group of microorganisms produces a high molecular weight complex, the cellulosome, which consists of a cellulosome-integrating protein to which different cellulolytic enzymes are bound. However, most fungal and bacteria posses many different single cellulolytic enzymes. The fungal system is less diverse than its bacterial counterpart. The catalytically active core structures of fungal cellulases can be classified into five families according to Henrissat et al. (1989) and Henrissat and Bairoch (1993) Henrissat and Romeu (1995). This includes the CBH belonging to families 6 and 7. Bacterial cellulases are found in eight families (5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 44, 45, 48) and CBH-like cellulases are found in families 6 and 48. There are thus, no bacterial cellulases found in family 7. The fungal cellulolytic enzymes can be further subdivided. One group consists of a single-domain cellulolytic core enzymes, while the members of the second group contain two-domain structures, where the catalytic core is joined to a cellulose binding domain by a region referred to as a linker region. The fungal CBDs are 36638 amino acid residues long and have a wedge-like structure (Kraulis et al., 1989). In addition to the catalytic domain, five of the Hurnicola cellulases contain a CBD domain at the N-terminus or at the C-terminus. The CBD is attached to the catalytic core via a linker region which consists of 0-glycosylated serines and threonines together with many prolines. Bacteria cellulases are more diverse. Multiple domains can be linked together, and at least eight different bacteria CBD-families have been identified (Tomme et al., 1995). The present study deals with the enzymatic characterization of cellulases from Humicola insolens (a saprophytic fungus) which produces at least seven different cellulases representing five families, namely 5, 6, 7, 12, and 45. All seven

cellulases have been cloned and expressed in a non-cellulolytic host (Aspergillus oryzae). In addition, Humicola insolens produces xylanases belonging to families 10 and 11. 3D-structures from four of the five families are now available. In family 5, three bacterial cellulase core structures have been published: CelCc from Clostridium thermocellum (Dominguez et al., 1995) CelCCA from Clostridium cellulyticus (Ducros et al., 1995) and El from Acidothermus cellulolyticus (Sakon et al., 1996). In family 6, both a fungal and a bacterial core cellulase structure has been determined, viz. cellobiohydrolase II from Trichoderma reesei (Rouvinen et al., 1990) and endocellulase E2 from Thermomonospora fusca (Spezio et al., 1993). Family 7, cellulases are only found in fungal systems. Three structures are published, namely CBH 1 from Trichoderma reesei (Divne et al., 1994) Humicola EC I (Davies et al., 1997) and Fusarium EG I (Sulzenbacher et al., 1996). In family 12 the structure of Aspergillus aculeatus CMCase has been presented in Japan, but the coordinates are not yet available. Family 45 is found in both bacterial and fungal systems, and the structure of the endoglucanase V core from Humicola insolens has been published (Davies et al., 1993, 1995). The purpose of the following work was to determine the catalytic activity of the cellulases with a highly homogeneous substrate. The incubation time was at most 20 min, to retain steady state conditions during the whole incubation period, and thus, obtain reliable kinetic constants. This will enable us to achieve a more precise understanding of the optimal conditions for each cellulase. Phosphoric-acid swollen cellulose (PASC) was used to obtain apparent kinetic constants on insoluble substrate. This substrate is more homogeneous than Avicel or filter paper, which both contain amorphous as well as crystalline regions. The activity of the cellulases on CMC has also been determined and used for pH activity profiles of the EGs. However, the substitutions on the CMC substrate make it inaccessible to the two CBHs. Therefore, the pH activity profiles on the cellobiohydrolases were measured using cellotriose and reduced DP6.

With regard to the family 7 cellulases, which can degrade cellotriose, a new method was optimized using cellotriose as substrate. Steady state kinetic data were obtained by direct detection of the product glucose. Finally, the inhibition of family 7 cellulases by cellobiose was also determined.

2. Material 2.1. Enzymes

and methods

All the enzymes were produced by cloning the gene and transforming it into Aspergillus oryzae using a plasmid with the gene inserted between the gene coding for fungal amylase promoter and the gene coding for the AMG terminator from A. niger (Christensen et al., 1988). Cellobiose dehydrogenase was purified from a cellulase product from Novo Celluzyme, Nordisk produced by Humicola insobns (Schou et al., 1993b). 2.2. PuriJication of cellulases with CBD

The cellulases with a CBD were purified by exploiting their binding to Avicel. After the extracellular fluid was separated from the production The cellulase was then purified to a organism. affinity chromatography. high degree using Avicel, 150 g, in a slurry with 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.5 was mixed with the crude spent medium containing about 1 g of protein in total. After incubation at 4°C for 20 min, the Avicel-bound enzyme was packed into a 400 ml column. The column was washed with 200 ml buffer, then washed with 0.5 M NaCl in the same buffer until no more protein eluted, and washed with 500 ml buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.5). Finally, the pure full-length enzyme was eluted with 1% triethylamine pH 11.8. All the cellulases were fully stable at this high pH. The eluted enzyme solution was adjusted to pH 8 and concentrated using an Amicon cell unit with a 20 kDa cut-off membrane (polypropylene DOW GR6lPP) to 5 mg 1~ ' protein. The purified enzymes all gave a single band on SDS-PAGE.

Some cellulases lack CBDs either for natural reasons, through proteolytic cleavage or due to the introducing of a stop codon after the catalytic domain. These cellulases could not be purified on Avicel. Instead, these core cellulases were separated from the Aspergillus proteins by cation exchange chromatography on the extracellular proteins as follows. The spent medium was adjusted to pH 3.5 and filtered to remove the precipitating proteins. Then the proteins were subjected to ultra-filtration (concentrated and washed with water) on a DOW GR81PP membrane with a cut off 6 kDa until the conductivity of the eluate was below 1000 ms cm - `. The sample was finally applied to a S-Sepharose column equilibrated with a 20 mM citrate buffer pH 3.5. The enzyme will bind to the S-Sepharose at this low pH and it is eluted as a single peak using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 500 mM. The eluted pure enzyme was concentrated on an Amicon cell with a DOW GR81PP membrane. All the cellulases were stable at pH 3.5. If the enzyme was not pure at this stage, a final purification step involving size chromatography using Superdex 75 or 200 was added. 2.4. Buffers All enzyme experiments of the following buffers: pH pH pH pH pH pH 3.0-3.5: 4.0-5.5: 6.0: 6.5-7.5: 8.0-8.5: 9.0- 10.0: 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 M M M M M M were performed in one

modified from Lever (1972) using 5 g of potassium sodium tartrate in addition to 1.5 g of PHBAH. The CBHs have very low activity on CMC, so soluble cellodextrin was used to obtain the pH activity profiles. Cellotriose was used for CBH I and reduced cellohexaose for CBH II. CBH I was incubated with 0.1 mM cellotriose (a little below the KM Table 2). The formation of glucose was determined using the glucose oxidase coupled assay (see below). The CBH II was incubated with reduced cellohexaose at a final concentration of 0.1 mM (five times K,) and the formation of reducing sugars was determined using the modified PHBAH method from Lever (1972). Cellohexaose was reduced with 25(X, sodium borohydride (w:w) as described (Schou et al., 1993b). 2.6. Celluluse kinetic studies on cellotviose

slope of the curve after monitoring of the reaction for 200 s by recording the linear increase in the absorbance at 418 nm. The kinetic parameters were calculated using enzyme kinetic equations in the program GraFit (Leatherbarrow, 1992). Inhibition studies were done by adding a constant amount of cellobiose and then measuring the steady state kinetics using different concentrations of cellotriose. The KI was calculated using the equation for competitive inhibition in the program Grafit (Leatherbarrow, 1992). 2.7. Cellulusc~ kinetics using reduced cellodextrins

The steady state kinetic determination using cellotriose as substrate, was obtained by the simultaneous determination of the formed glucose. Glucose is produced by cleavage of cellotriose, irrespective of whether cleavage is at the reducing end or at the non-reducing end. The detection of glucose can be determined using ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline6-sulfonic acid, Boehringer Mannheim cat. no. 102946) together with glucose oxidase (GOD) and peroxidase (POD) in a coupled reaction. Both enzymes and ABTS can be used in the pH range of 6.0-8.5. The half life of reduced ABTS is not long enough for steady state kinetic determinations at pH above 9.0. The cellotriose was from Merck, the GOD-Perid test were from Boehringer Mannheim. To obtain linear steady state conditions, the final ABTS concentration was increased to 6 mg ml ' (9.1 mM) using the recommended POD concentration of > 0.8 U ml ~ ' and a GOD concentration of more than 10 U ml-`. The determination was done with six different cellotriose concentrations in the range of 0.2-5 times K, using an enzyme concentration around 0.1 pmol for the EG and 15 pmol for the CBH. The reaction was done at 40°C in a temperature controlled cuvette in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The formation of glucose was calculated from the

This method is described in detail in Schou et al. (1993b). The principle is that cellobiose dehydrogenase does not react on reduced cellodextrins, but when the cellulase cleaves the substrate, one of the two products has a reducing group and will be oxidized with the cellobiose dehydrogenase. However, if the product with the reducing group is glucose, it is not detected. The dehydrogenase then reduces a colored substrate, 2,6-dichloroindophenol or cytochrome c. The assay was also used at pH 7.5 and 9.5. At pH 9.5, the reduced 2,6-dichloroindophenol was not stable, instead cytochrome c was used. The cellobiose dehydrogenase is fully stable at both pH-values, and the rate of formation of increased color at 550 nm was used to calculate the hydrolysis rate using an extinction coefficient of 19 600 M - ' cm - ' (Yonetani, 1965). The assay was done using six different substrate concentrations between 0.005 and 2 mM depending on the KM. To stabilize the assay, PEG 6000 was added before incubation to a final concentration of 1 g `. The assay was done under conditions where the cellobiodehydrogenase was not rate limiting. However, at very low substrate concentrations (5510 LIM), the steady state rate lasted at most about 60 s; at higher substrate concentrations it was constant for 300 s. Only steady state data were used for calculations. 2.8. Appurent kinetic constant determination phosphoric-acid swollen cellulose (PASC) PASC stock solution was prepared using

ing way. Cellulose (Avicel), 5 g, was moistened with water, and 150 ml ice cold 85% ortho-phosphoric-acid was added. The suspension was slowly stirred in an ice-bath for 1 h. Then 100 ml ice cold acetone was added while stirring. The slurry was transfered to a Buchner filter with Pyrex sintered disc number three and then washed three times with 100 ml ice cold acetone, sucked as dry as possible after each wash. Finally it was washed twice with 500 ml water, and again sucked as dry as possible after each wash. The PAX was mixed with deionized water to a total volume of 300 ml. It was blended to homogeneity (using an Ultra Turrax Homogenizer) and stored in a refrigerator for up to 1 month. Substrate was equilibrated with buffer using the following procedure: 20 g phosphoric-acid swollen cellulose PASC stock solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 rpm, the supernatant was poured off, and the sediment was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer. After 20 min centrifugation at 5000 rpm, the supernatant was decanted, and the sediment was resuspended in buffer to a total of 30 g. This corresponds to a substrate concentration of 10 mg l- `. To measure kinetic parameters, substrate concentrations from 0.2 to 8 mg mll i were used. Rates were measured at eight different substrate concentrations in duplicate. The amount of reducing sugars was determined using the PHBAH method modified from Lever (1972). The enzyme concentration was calculated using the molar absorbancy. The apparent kinetic constants KMcapp.), Vmax(app.jand kcatcapp.) were calculated using the equation for enzyme kinetics in the computer program GraFit (Leatherbarrow, 1992). 2.9. Determination of the stereochemical course of hydrolysis of EG II and CBH I All substrates, enzymes and buffer materials were freeze-dried twice from D,O prior to use. Proton NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker ACP 300 and AC 300 spectrometers operating at 300 MHz. Typically, 10 mg of the appropriate reduced cellodextrin in 450 ~1 D,O and 50 ~1 of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer in D,O were loaded in 5 mm sample tubes and a first spectrum

was recorded. Then 20 ~1 of enzyme solution in D,O was added and spectra were recorded at 5, 10, 15, 30 and 50 min.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. The cellulases As first proposed by Koshland (1953), glycosyl hydrolases either employ a retaining mechanism or an inverting mechanism. The present work confirms that the EG II and CBH I both have a retaining mechanism, as previously reported for homologous enzymes (Gebler et al., 1992). The mechanism of the other five cellulases was published by Schou et al. (1993b). The molar extinction coefficients were published in the latter paper. However, those values were based on the full sequence of CBH II, EG I and EG V, and the amino acid composition of the other cellulases. Now the latter have also been sequenced. The molar extinction coefficients in Table 1 are based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence. The domain composition and stereochemical mechanisms of the cellulases are listed in Table 1. They are listed according to the family they belong to, as based on the catalytic core sequence (Henrissat and Bairoch, 1993). 3.2. Family 5 cellulase EG II is a family 5 endoglucanase with the N-terminal CBD. Details on cloning and sequencing are published in Dalboge and Heldthansen (1994). The amino acid sequence of the EG II-cellulase was found to be homologous with EG II from Trichoderma reesei. The degree of homology between these two cellulases is approximately 50%. The sequence of the EG II-cellulase from Trichoderma reesei was published as `EG III, a new endoglucanase from T. reesei' (Saloheimo et al., 1988). Based on the structure of the three bacterial family 5 sequences published (Dominguez et al., 1995; Ducros et al., 1995) and (Sakon et al., 1996) it can be concluded that the core enzyme folds as a TIM barrel with a typical alternating P-strand, M helix motif.

The number of amino acid residues in the three domains (the catalytic core, the linker and the cellulose binding domain (CBD)), are based on sequence alignment to homologous cellulases with known function or by introducing stop codon and detemination of activity. The molar extinction coefficient was calculated based on the amino acid composition obtained from the DNA sequence. The stereochemical course of hydrolysis was determined using deuterium reduced substrate and following the hydolysis with NMR, as denoted by from *Schou et al. (1993b).

3.4. Family

7 celluluses

CBH II is a family 6 cellulase with N-terminal CBD. The sequence of this CBH is more than 65% homologous with T. reesei CBH II (Hastrup, personal communication). The sequence is so homologous that no gaps are required in the sequence alignment. This indicates that the Humicolu CBH II has the same loops as T. reesei CBH II. These loops cover the active site as seen in the 3D structure (Rouvien et al. 1990). The EG VI is a fungal endoglucanase with activity on CMC. The cloning is published by Dalboge and Heldthansen (1994). The sequence of the core has 60% homology with the CBH II. However, in the alignment a gap can be identified at amino acids number 405-415 in CBH II (Flensted, personal communication) corresponding to a loop which covers the active site of CBH II (Rouvinen et al., 1990). Other cellulases from this family comprise other fungal CBH II enzymes as well as EGs and CBHs from bacteria (Meinke et al., 1994 and Zhang et al., 1995). The structure of Thermomonospora jiiscu EG has been published (Spezio et al., 1993). As with family 5, the structure is a TIM barrel. The Humicolu EG VI has the CBD at the C-terminal.

Family 7 cellulases have hitherto only been found in fungi. CBH I has been found in most cellulolytic fungal strains including Neurosporu, Aguricus, Penicillium, Geotrichum, Phuenerochuete and Trichodermu, from which both the core 3D structure as well as the CBD 3D structure have been published (Divne et al., 1994 and Kraulis et al., 1989). A partial homologous Humicolu sequence has been published by Azevedo and Radford (1990). The Humicolu insolens CBH I was cloned by Dalboge and Heldthansen (1994). The sequence is highly homologous with the published Humicolu CBH I, although the linker is eight amino acid longer (Flensted, personal communication). The mechanism was identical with the other family 7 cellulases i.e. retaining. EG 1 is described by Schou et al. (1993b). The cellulase is homologous to Trichodermu EG I although it does not contain a CBD at the C-terminal end, in contrast to the EG from Trichodermu. The structure of this enzyme has been solved (Davies et al., 1997). Only the first 398 amino acid residues form an ordered structure. The remaining 17 residues are not required for catalytic activity. A construction with 402 residues has catalytic properties identical to the intact 415 residue long EG I.

For CBH I the substrate was cellotriose (0.1 mM) with incubation for 20 min and measurement of the formation of glucose at the different pH using GOD-PERID assay. For CBH II the activity was measured using 0.1 mM reduced DP6 as substrate, incubation for 20 min at 40°C and measuring the formation of reducing sugar. The relative activity is calculated in percentage of the maximal activity obtained at pH 9.0. for CBH II and at pH 5.0 for CBH I.

The two Humicola cellobiohydrolases are predicted to have an active site tunnel, based on sequence homology with the sequence of cellulases with known 3D-structure from family 6 and 7. These cellulases do not lower the viscosity of a CMC solution, and they only form small amounts of reducing sugar from CMC. However, they have

activity on cellodextrins. Fig. 1 shows the pH activity profile of the two cellobiohydrolases on soluble substrates. Humicola CBH II has no activity on cellotriose so reduced cellohexaose was used as substrate for the pH activity profile. The CBH II has the highest activity at pH 9.0, about 3 pH units higher than the homologous CBH II from Trichoderma. In contrast, the CBH I activity profile (using cellotriose) has pH optimum around pH 5-6, similar to Trichoderma (data not shown). Both enzymes are able to hydolyze a recently described bifunctionalized fluorogenic tetrasaccharide, which in the future can be used for pH activity profiles for these cellulases (Armand et al., 1997). The other five cellulases hydrolyse CMC (Schtilein et al., 1993). The structure of EG I and V is known and the active site residues in these enzymes are situated in an active site cleft. It may be a general feature that cellulases which can hydrolyze CMC, have an active site cleft which can accommodate the carboxymethyl groups attached to the glucose units. The endoglucanases have been analysed for pH activty using CMC (Fig. 2). All have pH optima in the range of 6-9. EG I, II and V have the broadest optima, EG VI the most narrow.

inhibition

The inhibition of family 7 cellulases by cellobiose can be seen in Table 2. Trichoderma reesei EG I is also characterized by its ability to degrade cellotriose (3iely et al., 1991), and the product (cellobiose) is an inhibitor. Cellobiase is important for total cellulose degradation due to competitive inhibition by cellobiose. The DP3 thiol inhibits EG I with a K, of 330 PM (Schou et al., 1993a). Thus, binding of the DP3 thiol is stronger than

cellobiose (K, of 900 PM), but weaker than cellotriose (KM of 114 PM). CBH I has pH optimum around 5-6. Therefore, pH 6.0 was chosen for inhibition of CBH I. The activity on cellotriose at this pH gave a k,..,, around 0.01 s ~ ' and a KM of 0.13 mM for cellotriose. At pH 8, the k,,, was about three times lower and the K, ten times higher (data not shown), in agreement with the pH activity profile, although we have used too low substrate concentration (below the KM) for the pH activity profile. The K, of cellobiose at pH 6.0 was 0.5 mM using cellotriose as substrate. Cellotriose is not the optimal substrate, the Trichoderma CBH I active site cleft is known to contain seven binding sites (Divne et al., 1994). By increasing the polymer chain length the hydrolytic rate will increase dramatically (Schou et al., 1993b). Using phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (with a DP around 200) a k,,, of 5 s-' could be obtained (Table 4). 3.9. Kinetic constant on reduced DP6

pected to move along the glucose polymer from the non-reducing end in a progressive manner. The family 7 cellulases have not been tested on reduced cellohexaose because glucose is also produced. This is not detected by the cellobiose dehydrogenase, thereby giving a wrong kinetic constant in this assay. 3.10. Kinetic constants on insoluble substrate

The results were obtained using the coupled assay with cellobiose dehydrogenase as described in methods. Experiments were performed in either sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 with 82 ,uM 2,6-dichloroindophenol or in glycine buffer pH 9.5 with 100 PM cytochrome C. The substrate was reduced DP6 in concentrations between 0.2 x KM and 5 x K,. Incubation 200&600 s at 40°C. The kinetic constants were calculated using Grafit program (Leatherbarrow, 1992). Standard errors within 1O'Y".

new data and the previously published data (Schou et al., 1993a,b) is due to the corrected molar extinction coefficient as well as a better curve fitting program. Changes in k,,, with pH are in agreement with the pH activity profile using CMC as substrate for the three endoglucanases: EG V has close to 80% alkaline activity at pH 9.5 compared with pH 7.5. EG II has 30% alkaline activity and EG VI has only lo%, also in agreement with the CMC profile. The EG III activity under alkaline conditions is too low to be determined. In this assay, CBH II has better activity at pH 7.5, although the pH activity profile indicated optimum at pH 9. However, the I&,, is higher at lower pH and the pH activity profile was carried out using a constant substrate concentration (0.1 mM). The conclusion must be that CBH II has a broad pH optimum between pH 7.5 and 9.0 on soluble substrate. It is interesting that two cellulases from family 6 have a much lower KM on reduced DP6. This could indicate that both the EG VI and the CBH II use the same mechanism of attacking from the non-reducing end. CBH II is ex-

Table 4 summarizes the apparent kinetic constants on PASC at two different pH values. All seven cellulases have been analyzed at pH 8.5 and they were all active indicating that this substrate is suitable for both CBHs and EGs. It is well known that synergy is observed on crystalline cellulose substrate such as filter paper or Avicel (Henrissat et al., 1985). But no synergy is obtained with PAX (data not shown). It can be used in concentrations up to 8 g 1~ `, this is in all cases above the apparent KM. The CBH I and EG III are not very active at pH 8.5 so they have not been analysed at pH 10. CBH I has the lowest apparent KM. Both CBH I and CBH II are less active than the endoglucanases (EG V, II and VI). However, the CBH II core has four-fold higher catalytic activity without the CBD on PASC at pH 8.5. EG III is extremely slow under our assay conditions and we have not found a better substrate for this cellulase although we also tested its activity on: barley /?-glucan, xylan and xyloglucan. Therefore, the function of this cellulase remains unclear. Our results shed light on the function of the CBD. The CBD's lower the apparent KM for the cellulases and in some cases also the apparent k,,,. This suggests a dual function of the CBD; one is to find the substrate and anchor the core close to it, the other is the dispersing effect. Both functions are important when the hydrolysis is done under substrate limiting conditions. In the case of the cellobiohydrolase II, the anchoring effect has slowed down the activity by binding to areas without reducing end (non productive binding). The decreased mobility due to the presence of CBD also reduces the apparent k,,,.

The results were obtained after incubation in 20 min at 40°C at either pH 8.5 or 10. After determination of reducing sugars, the apparent kinetic constants were calculated using the Grafit program (Leatherbarrow, 1992). The concentration of substrate were between 0.2*K, and max. 8 g I- `_ Standard errors within 10%.

4. Conclusion All the seven cellulases degrade reduced DP6 and phosphoric acid swollen cellulose at a reasonably high rate. Most of the problems in the field of cellulolytic degradation are caused by the heterogeneity of the substrate. In this work I have chosen well defined homogeneous substrates to obtain more accurate data on the catalytic properties of the different cellulases. The fungus Humicolu insokns produces many different cellulases, each with its own specificity. EG I is the most efficient on soluble substrate and EG V is the most efficient cellulase on amorphous cellulose. EG I, EG II, EG V and EG VI have similar activity on CMC (45-80 CMCU rng- ' Schiilein et al., 1993). EG I and EG II are best on CMC whereas EG V, EG VI, CBH I and CBH II are best on PASC. CBH I can furthermore degrade crystalline cellulose. For total hydrolysis of cellulose, a combination of all cellulases will be the optimal choice and the inhibition by cellobiose (which is a major product of hydrolysis) can be overcome by the presence of a cellobiase (p glycosidase) which also is produced by Humicolu insolens but not characterized in this work. However, for more specific industrial applications like stone wash, color care in detergent, cleaning cellulase in detergent, drainage of pulp for paper mak-

ing etc. only single cellulases few highly specific cellulases

or a combination are required.
