Abstract The determinants governing the self-catalyzed splicing and cleavage events by a mini-intein of 154 amino acids, derived from the dnaB gene of Synechocystis sp. were investigated. The residues at the splice junctions have a profound effect on splicing and peptide bond cleavage at either the N- or C-terminus of the intein. Mutation of the native Gly residue preceding the intein blocked splicing and cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction, while substitution of the intein C-terminal Asn154 resulted in the modulation of N-terminal cleavage activity. Controlled cleavage at the C-terminal splice junction involving cyclization of Asn154 was achieved by substitution of the intein N-terminal cysteine residue with alanine and mutation of the native C-extein residues. The C-terminal cleavage reaction was found to be pH-dependent, with an optimum between pH 6.0 and 7.5. These findings allowed the development of single junction cleavage vectors for the facile production of proteins as well as protein building blocks with complementary reactive groups. A protein sequence was fused to either the N-terminus or C-terminus of the intein, which was fused to a chitin binding domain. The N-terminal cleavage reaction was induced by 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid and released the 43 kDa maltose binding protein with an active C-terminal thioester. The 58 kDa T4 DNA ligase possessing an N-terminal cysteine was generated by a C-terminal cleavage reaction induced by pH and temperature shifts. The intein-generated proteins were joined together through a native peptide bond. This intein-mediated protein ligation approach opens up novel routes in protein engineering. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

exteins (Perler et al., 1994). Since the initial discovery of a 454-residue intein in the 69 kDa vacuolar membrane ATPase subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sce VMA intein) ( Kane et al., 1990; Hirata et al., 1990), almost 100 inteins have been identified in eubacteria, archea and eucaryotic unicellular organisms (InBase, the Intein registry Web site at http://www.neb.com/neb/ inteins.html; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The alignment of inteins has revealed that most inteins are bifunctional proteins and contain a centrally located endonuclease domain, while a few inteins (termed miniinteins), ranging in size from 134 to 198 amino acids (aa), lack the endonuclease region (Perler et al., 1997; Pietrokovski, 1998). In vitro protein splicing of purified protein precursors indicated that protein splicing is a self-catalyzed reaction ( Xu et al., 1993; Chong et al., 1996). Analysis of the

splicing intermediates and products suggested that protein splicing proceeds via four tightly coupled nucleophilic displacements ( Xu et al., 1994; Chong et al., 1996; Xu and Perler, 1996; Shao et al., 1996). Hydroxyl or thiol containing residues (Cys, Ser or Thr) at the positions immediately following the two splice junctions and an invariant Asn at the intein C-terminus are essential for the intein-catalyzed splicing reaction ( Fig. 1). Splicing is initiated by an N­S (or N­O) acyl rearrange-

ment involving Cys (or Ser) at the N-terminus of the intein, generating a reactive thioester (or ester) linkage at the N-terminal splice junction. Next, transesterification involving attack by the side chain of Ser, Cys or Thr at the beginning of the C-extein on the linear thioester (or ester) intermediate formed in Step 1 leads to the generation of a branched intermediate. The branch is resolved by the attack of the intein C-terminal asparagine sidechain on the scissile peptide bond linking the

Fig. 1. Proposed protein splicing and cleavage pathway for the Ssp DnaB mini-intein. Protein splicing occurs via four concerted nucleophilic replacements: Step 1 -- formation of a linear thioester intermediate at the N-terminus of the intein by an N­S acyl rearrangement at Cys1. Step 2 -- Formation of a branched intermediate by transesterification involving attack by the side chain of Ser155 on the thioester formed in Step 1. Step 3 -- Excision of the intein by peptide bond cleavage coupled to succinimide formation by Asn154 at the C-terminus of the intein. Step 4 -- Spontaneous O­N acyl rearrangement of the transitory ligated exteins to form a stable amide bond. Protein splicing for other inteins presumably proceeds by four analogous chemical steps, except that the Cys residues may be replaced by Ser or Thr or vice versa, as described previously ( Xu and Perler, 1996; Chong et al., 1996; Shao et al., 1996). N-Terminal splice junction cleavage can occur by hydrolysis or nucleophilic attack of the thioester or ester linkage. Cyclization of Asn154 can proceed independently when the normal route of the splicing reaction is inhibited.

intein and C-extein resulting in release of the intein. Finally, the ester (or thioester) linkage between the exteins undergoes a spontaneous acyl rearrangement to form a native peptide bond. Our previous work on protein splicing chemistry has shown that self-splicing inteins can be used in the production and labeling of proteins (Chong et al., 1997). In this system, the C-terminal asparagine of the Sce VMA intein is mutated to alanine to block C-terminal cleavage but still allow formation of a thioester linking the N-extein and the intein. In conjunction with the use of a chitin binding domain fused to the intein C-terminus, a bacterially expressed fusion protein can be purified on a chitin matrix and the protein of interest can be released in the presence of a thiol compound such as 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT ) by transthioesterification. Recently, this intein N-terminal cleavage system was exploited to generate bacterially expressed proteins with a C-terminus thioester for ligation to a synthetic peptide ( Evans et al., 1998; Muir et al., 1998; Severinov and Muir, 1998; Gimble, 1998). This new protein semisynthetic method defined as intein mediated protein ligation (IPL) ( Evans et al., 1998, 1999), or expressed protein ligation ( EPL) (Muir et al., 1998), extended the previously developed `native chemical ligation' technique (Dawson et al., 1994; Tam et al., 1995) in which the C-terminal thioester of a synthetic peptide is generated chemically. However, the need for a C-terminal synthetic peptide in IPL remained a major obstacle for the broad use of this technique. The dnaB gene encoding for DNA helicase of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 (Ssp) contains an intein of 429 amino acid residues (Pietrokovski, 1996). We have previously shown that the Synechocystis sp. DnaB intein is capable of splicing with five native extein residues flanking both splice junctions ( Wu et al., 1998). A deletion of the central 275 amino acid residues resulted in a splicing-proficient minimal intein (Ssp DnaB mini-intein) consisting of the N-terminal 106 residues and the C-terminal 48 residues. In the study reported here, we sought to investigate the roles of extein residues in the splicing of the Ssp DnaB mini-intein, and to search for new approaches to the modulation of splicing and cleavage activity. The selfsplicing Ssp DnaB mini-intein has been converted into catalytic domains capable of cleavage at its N-terminal or C-terminal junction. These systems were employed to readily generate large bacterially expressed proteins with an N-terminal cysteine residue and protein containing a reactive C-terminal thioester for protein ligation. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Numbering of residues in the Ssp DnaB mini-intein fusion Amino-acid numbers refer to the position in the 154 amino acid minimal intein, with Cys1 being the first

residue of the intein and Asn154 the last. The numbering continues sequentially into the C-extein beginning with Ser155. The N-extein residue adjacent to Cys1 is referred as -1, and the numbering continues sequentially into the N-extein. 2.2. Plasmid construction The full-length Ssp DnaB intein (429 residues) and the minimal intein of 154 amino-acid residues derived from a deletion of 275 intein residues within the fulllength intein ( Wu et al., 1998) were inserted in-frame into pMYT1 (Chong et al., 1996) between the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP or M, 43 kDa) and the E. coli thioredoxin protein (12 kDa) to create pMST2 and pMST2d, respectively. All enzymes were manufactured by New England Biolabs (NEB, Beverly, MA). The inteins are flanked with five native N-extein residues (LRESG) and five native C-extein residues (SIEQD). The intein and the native extein sequences are flanked with unique XhoI and AgeI sites. To facilitate mutagenesis of the amino-acid residues at both splice junctions by linker replacement , the unique restriction sites NheI and NruI were introduced into the mini-intein by the following steps. A unique NheI site was introduced into pMST2d downstream of the intein N-terminal splice junction by silent base substitutions using Kunkel mutagenesis ( Kunkel et al., 1987) to yield pMST3d. A unique NruI site was introduced by silent base substitutions upstream of the intein C-terminal splice junction, the mini-intein, except for the C-terminal 7 residues, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pMST3d DNA using Vent DNA polymerase and the primers (5-G AGG GGG CTC GAG TTA AGA GAG AGT GGC TGC ATC AGT GGA G-3 and 5-CAC GAT ACC GGT GAT GTC ATT CGC GAC AAA GTT ATG-3). The PCR fragment digested with XhoI and AgeI was ligated with pMST2d digested with XhoI and AgeI to replace the original sequence to yield pMST4d. A linker replacement using NruI and AgeI sites in pMST4d reintroduced the missing intein residues and the first five native C-extein residues (SIEQD) with a substitution of Asn154 with Ala to yield pMST4A. The deletion of the native extein residues -2 to -5 (LRES) preceding the N-terminal splice junction in pMST4A resulted in the amino-acid sequence GTLE in front of Gly-1 yielding pMST11. Substitution of Gly-1 with Leu was made by ligation of a mutagenic linker in the XhoI­ NheI sites of pMST4A yielding pMST12. pMSB11 was constructed by transferring the 0.5 kb XhoI­AgeI fragment of pMST11 into the corresponding sites in pMYB129 (NEB) to create a three-part fusion protein termed (MSB) consisting of the E. coli MBP, the N-terminus of the Ssp DnaB mini-intein (S) containing an N154A substitution, and a chitin-binding domain

(CBD or B) from the C-terminal region of chitinase A1 from Bacillus circulans WL-12 ( Watanabe et al., 1994; Chong et al., 1997). pMSB17 ( Table 1) was constructed by transferring the DNA sequence of the MSB fusion gene into an expression vector pTYB1 (NEB) under control of the T7lac promoter (Studier et al., 1990; Dubendorff and Studier, 1991). pMSB12 was created by transferring the 0.5 kb XhoI­AgeI fragment of pMST12 into pMSB17. pMSB2 was made by transferring the full-length Ssp DnaB intein (429 amino acids) from pMST2 into the XhoI­AgeI sites in pMSB17. The deletion of Glu-2 and Leu-3 in pMSB17 was achieved by linker replacement using the SacI and NheI sites in pMSB17, resulting in pMSB17GC1. Random mutagenesis of Asn154 was performed by ligation of pMSB17 digested with NruI and AgeI with the complementary oligomers containing the bases NN(G/C ) for the 154 position. The resulting constructs, pMSB17X154, were sequenced to identify the amino acid residue at the 154 position. Other MSB mutants ( Table 1) were created by linker replacement using the unique XhoI and NheI sites flanking the N-terminal splice junction or NruI and AgeI sites flanking the C-terminal splice junction in pMSB17 or a derivative. The pBYT4 vector expresses a three-part fusion protein consisting of the chitin binding domain (CBD), the

Sce VMA intein (Chong et al., 1997), and T4 DNA ligase (58 kDa, Armstrong et al., 1983). pMSL1 was generated by ligation of the 1.3 kb AgeI­PstI fragment containing the coding region of T4 DNA ligase from pBYT4 with the pMSB32 vector DNA digested with AgeI and PstI. Substitution of Ser155 with the other 19 natural amino-acid residues was carried out by linker insertion into Nru I and Age I sites in pMSL1. The resulting constructs, pMSL-X155, were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All pMSL constructs contained the C1A mutation, which blocked both splicing and N-terminal cleavage events. pBSL-I155 was constructed by subcloning the 1.8 kb XhoI­PstI fragment containing the mini-intein­T4 DNA ligase coding region from pMSL-I155 into pBYT4. The fusion gene was subcloned into the NdeI and PstI sites of pTYB1 (NEB) for expression under control of the T7 promoter (Studier et al., 1990). pBSL-C155 was created by linker insertion resulting in CRAMG immediately downstream of the intein. 2.3. Analysis of in vivo splicing and cleavage activity Escherichia coli ER2566 cells (NEB; Chong et al., 1997) bearing plasmids were grown at 37°C in 3 ml LB medium containing 100 mg/ml of ampicillin to an A 600 of 0.5­0.6. Expression of the MSB fusion proteins was

induced by 0.3 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 15°C for 16 h. The cells were broken by sonication at 4°C. Crude extracts (40 ml ) were mixed with 20 ml of 3×SDS­PAGE sample buffer (NEB) supplemented with 15 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl )-phosphine ( TCEP, PIERCE, Rockford, IL). The sample buffer contained 187.5 mM Tris­HCl, 6% (w/v) SDS, 30% glycerol and 0.03% (w/v) bromophenol blue. The samples were boiled for 10 min and electrophoresed on a 12% Tris­glycine PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The running buffer was 25 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 190 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS. The stained gels were scanned with a Microtec Scanmaker III. To examine the effects of boiling and thiol reagents on MSB fusion proteins, crude extracts (40 ml ) were mixed with 20 ml of 3×SDS­PAGE sample buffer (NEB) with or without DTT (50 mM ) or TCEP (15 mM ). The samples were either incubated at 4°C, 37°C or boiled for 10 min before running on SDS­ PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. 2.4. Expression and purification of MSL fusion proteins ER2566 transformed with pMSL-I155 were induced with 0.3 mM IPTG at 30°C for 3 h in LB media supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin. Protein purification on amylose resin was carried out as described previously (Chong et al., 1997). The column buffer contained 20 mM Na­Hepes (pH 8.5), 0.5 M NaCl. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976) and the samples were analyzed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS­PAGE. To investigate the optimal pH for in vitro C-terminal cleavage reactions, 20 mM Na­Hepes (pH 8.5) buffer was substituted by 100 mM bis-Tris­propane/100 mM sodium acetate buffer with the pH adjusted from pH 5.0 to 9.5. Amylose-purified MSL-I155 or other fusion proteins were incubated at different pH at 25°C for 30 h. 2.5. Purification of thioester-tagged protein pMSB17 expresses a tripartite fusion protein (MSB) consisting of MBP­Ssp mini-intein (N154A)­chitin binding domain. Expression in ER2566 bearing pMSB17 was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG at 30°C for 3 h. The soluble fraction was loaded onto three columns each with 10 ml bed volume of chitin beads (NEB). The columns were washed with 20 column volumes of column buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCl ) at 4°C. The columns were flushed with the column with or without 50 mM DTT or buffer 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA) (Sigma Chemical Co., Saint Louis, MO) before the flow was stopped. The columns were incubated overnight at 4°C (with DTT or MESNA) or at 25°C (without thiol reagent). The protein was eluted with the column buffer

(pH 8.0). Typically, 4­6 mg of protein were obtained from 1 L of culture. 2.6. Generation of T4 DNA ligase with an N-terminal cysteine ER2566 bearing pBSL-C155 was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG at 30°C for 3 h. Cells were sonicated in column buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 0.5 M NaCl ). The soluble fraction from a 2 L induced culture was loaded onto a column at 4°C with 20 ml bed volume of chitin beads. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of column buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 0.5 M NaCl ) and then flushed with cleavage buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl ) before the flow was stopped. The column was incubated at 25°C for 16 h and 10 mg of protein was eluted. 2.7. Ligation reaction and analysis Freshly isolated thioester-tagged MBP and T4 DNA ligase with an N-terminal cysteine, starting concentration of 10­25 mM, were mixed and concentrated with a Centriprep 30 and Centricon 10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to a final concentration of 400­600 mM for each protein. The concentrated protein samples were incubated overnight at 4°C and then analyzed by 12% Tris­ glycine PAGE (Novex) stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (Sigma). Four milligrams of ligation sample were bound to 4 ml of amylose resin (NEB). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl before proteins were eluted with column buffer containing 10 mM maltose. The eluted proteins were treated with bovine factor Xa (NEB) at a protein:FXa ratio of 200:1 at 4°C for 16 h. N-Terminal sequencing of factor Xa generated protein was performed on a Procise 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The N-terminal sequencing data showed NH YGTLEGCRAMGY 2 COOH. The cysteine residue was identified as the acrylamide alkylation product.

3. Results 3.1. The effect of extein mutations on protein splicing The 154 aa Ssp DnaB mini-intein (S) or the fulllength Ssp DnaB intein (429 aa), with five native flanking N-extein and C-extein residues, were inserted in-frame between the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP or M, 43 kDa) and a chitin-binding domain (B, 5 kDa) from Bacillus circulans. Mutants carrying substitutions of the native extein residues ( Table 1) were examined for splicing activity by analyzing E. coli cell extracts on SDS­PAGE ( Fig. 2). The splicing of MSB2 (98 kDa, lane 1), containing the full-length Ssp DnaB intein, and

splicing, resulting in accumulation of MSB precursor protein. In addition, substitution of Cys1 with Ala inhibited splicing but allowed proficient cleavage at the C-terminus of the intein, producing a product of 61 kDa expected for MBP-intein (MS) ( Fig. 2, lane 10). The identity of the splicing products were verified by Western blot analysis using antiserum raised against MBP, the Ssp DnaB intein and CBD domain (data not shown). 3.2. The effect of extein mutations on thioester formation at Cys1 To investigate the role of the extein residues in the N­S acyl rearrangement to form a thioester linkage between Cys1 and the preceding residue, a series of constructs, each with an N154A mutation to block C-terminal cleavage, were created ( Table 1). Replacing the native N-extein residues (-2 to -5), except for Gly-1, (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4) or simultaneous replacement of both native extein residues at -2 to -5 and 156­159 ( lane 7), exhibited little inhibitory effect on N-terminal cleavage, resulting in processing of the MSB precursor to yield MBP (42 kDa) and the intein­chitin binding domain (SB) species (with an apparent molecular mass of 28­32 kDa). Furthermore, substitution of Ser155 by Cys or Thr also did not block the N-terminal cleavage reaction ( Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). However, N-terminal cleavage was substantially inhibited when Gly-1was replaced by Leu ( lane 1), Ala ( lane 3) or Pro (data not shown). The difference in the rate of migration of the intein­CBD (SB) species or, to a smaller extent, M on SDS­PAGE appeared due to the absence of DTT in the protein sample buffer as well as amino-acid substitutions. Cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction occurs when the thioester bond formed at Cys1 is attacked by thiol reagents such as 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT ), or undergoes hydrolysis. The equilibrium between precursor and thioester intermediate in induced cells was investigated based on the effect of high-temperature treatment, which increases the rate of hydrolysis, and the presence of DTT. The MSB17 crude extract samples were mixed with SDS­PAGE sample buffer with and without DTT, and then subjected to treatment at different temperatures (4°C, 37°C or boiling) for 10 min before subjection to SDS­PAGE ( Fig. 3B). Boiling of the samples, with or without DTT, resulted in a decrease of fusion precursor and an increase of MBP. In comparison to the sample treated at 4°C in the absence of DTT ( lane 4), the amount of full-length fusion protein decreased by approx. 40­60% after boiling in the presence ( lane 3) or absence of DTT ( lane 6). DTT in the SDS­PAGE sample buffer increased cleavage to a smaller extent during incubation at 37°C or 4°C. Similar treatment of MSB12 or MSB17A-1 cell extracts showed little effect on the cleavage of the fusion proteins, indicating that Leu or Ala at the -1 position inhibited

Cells containing plasmids with mutants of the MSB protein (see Table 1) were induced overnight at 15°C as described in Materials and methods. Following induction, the crude cell extracts were analyzed by Coomassie Bluestained SDS­PAGE. Lane 1, splicing of the MSB2 protein, MBP­S ­CBD (MSB2, 98 kDa), resulted in the formation of the 429 ligation product MBP­CBD (MB, 50 kDa) and the full-length Ssp intein (S , 48 kDa). Note the presence of a small amount of 429 N-terminal cleavage resulting in MBP (M, 43 kDa). Lane 2, splicing of the Ssp mini-intein from protein MSB4N, MBP­S ­CBD (MSB, 154 68 kDa) yielded MB and the free mini-intein (S , apparent molar 154 mass of 22 kDa).

The position 154 of molecular weight markers (NEB Broadrange) are shown on the left in kDa.

MSB4N (68 kDa, lane 2), containing the Ssp miniintein with five native N- and C-terminal extein residues, resulted in the accumulation of ligated exteins (MB, 50 kDa) and excised intein with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa and 22 kDa, respectively. Studies with MSB4N and derivatives demonstrated that mutants with the substitutions of four native N-extein residues, -2 to -5 (pMSB31, lane 4), or both -2 to -5 residues and four native C-extein residues, 156­159 (pMSB17C5, lane 5), yielded expected splicing products, indicating efficient splicing. Substitution of Ser-2 with Pro also allowed proficient splicing (pMSB31P-2, lane 3). However, Ala at the -1 position (pMSB31A-1) partially inhibited splicing in vivo exhibiting approx. 20% splicing products ( lane 6). Substitutions of the native -1 residue, Gly-1, by Leu ( lane 7) or Pro ( lane 8), as well as the substitution of Ile156 by Pro ( lane 9), blocked

the accumulation of the thioester intermediate (data not shown). 3.3. Modulation of N-terminal cleavage activity by mutation of Asn154 Protein splicing requires precise alignment of the two splice junctions to form the active site. To explore the

plausible interaction between the two intein termini, the intein C-terminal asparagine residue (Asn154) in pMSB17 was substituted with 13 naturally occurring amino-acid residues and the in vivo splicing activity of the mutants were examined by SDS­PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3C, all mutations blocked splicing and C-terminal cleavage. Interestingly, the N-terminal cleavage reaction was strongly affected by substitution of Asn154 with

8

other residues. For a large group of amino acids at position 154, including Met, Val, Glu, Thr, Cys, Ser, and Gln, the fusion proteins underwent efficient in vivo cleavage (>90%) at the N-terminal splice junction, resulting in the accumulation of MBP (43 kDa) and intein-CBD species (SB), with an apparent molecular mass of 28­32 kDa, whereas Ala, Gly, Pro or His mutants showed 60­80% in vivo cleavage. However, substitutions with Lys or Leu resulted in significantly slower in vivo cleavage (10­30%). Purified MSB proteins with Leu, Lys or Pro still underwent quantitative cleavage in the presence of DTT (data not shown). Furthermore, unlike MSB17 ( Fig. 3B), boiling of the cell extract in SDS­PAGE sample buffer in the presence of DTT had little effect on the stability of precursor proteins with Lys or Leu at position 154 (data not shown). 3.4. Modulation of intein C-terminal cleavage Substitution of the intein N-terminal Cys1 with Ala (pMSB32, Table 1) resulted in the inhibition of splicing and N-terminal cleavage and yielded a 61 kDa product (MBP­intein) corresponding to cleavage at the C-terminal splice junction ( Fig. 2, lane 10). In order to investigate the effect of the first C-extein residue on the cyclization of Asn154, Ser155 was substituted with the other 19 naturally occurring amino acids ( Table 1). In each case, the intein is expressed as a three-part fusion protein (MSL) comprising MBP domain (M, 43 kDa), the intein (S, 17 kDa), and T4 DNA ligase (L, 58 kDa). The replacement of the CBD (5 kDa) in pMSB32 by T4 DNA ligase assisted in the observation of C-terminal cleavage products by SDS­PAGE analysis. In vivo cleavage activity was analyzed by SDS­PAGE after induction of plasmid-bearing cells at 30°C for 3 h (Fig. 4A). The presence of Ser, Cys, Ala, or His at position 155 resulted in cleavage of more than 75% of the precursor proteins. Ser and Cys are the two most favored residues for C-terminal cleavage (approx. 90%). Nine substitutions (Gly, Met, Glu, Asp, Trp, Phe, Tyr, Val, and Thr) yielded various amounts of C-terminal cleavage (10­75%), while seven substitutions (Gln, Asn, Leu, Ile, Arg, Lys, and Pro) essentially blocked cleavage with less than 10% of the precursor being processed. Induction at 15°C resulted in similar patterns of C-terminal cleavage (data not shown). One major exception was that the Thr mutant resulted in a higher cleavage activity at 15°C (approx. 30%) as compared to approx. 10% at 30°C. Efficient in vivo cleavage prevented purification of MSL-S155 or MSL-C155 precursor proteins. However, mutants that accumulated protein precursors were used to study parameters affecting the C-terminal cleavage reaction. As shown in Fig. 4B, the C-terminal cleavage reaction of the MSL-I155 protein purified on amylose

resin was most favored at pH 6­7.5, yielding MBP­ intein (MS, 61 kDa) and T4 DNA ligase (L, 58 kDa), while the reaction was substantially inhibited below pH 5.5 or above pH 8.0. Examination of purified fusion proteins with Thr, Gly, Trp, Tyr, or Phe at the 155 position also showed essentially the same pH-dependent cleavage activity (data not shown). 3.5. Protein purification using inducible intein N- and C-terminal cleavage The Ssp mini-intein mutants demonstrate unique properties which may be exploited for inducible cleavage at either the N-terminal or C-terminal splice junctions. Proficient cleavage of the amylose purified MSB17 fusion protein (carrying Asn154Ala substitution) was observed by treatment with a thiol compound such as DTT or 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA) at 4°C, but also by incubation at higher temperatures (16­ 25°C ) without thiol reagent, presumably due to hydrolysis (data not shown). These properties allow for purification of a protein fused to the N-terminus of an intein­ CBD fusion protein. When E. coli cell extract expressing MSB17 was loaded onto chitin beads, followed by overnight incubation of the chitin column at pH 8.0 at 25°C or at 4°C with 50 mM DTT or 50 mM MESNA, highly pure MBP was eluted, with a yield of 4­6 mg/l of cell culture (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, cleavage of the MSB17 protein with Asn154 substituted with Leu, Lys or Pro resulted in a 2­10-fold increase in the final yield of MBP in the presence of DTT at 4°C (data not shown). In order to perform protein purification using an inducible C-terminal cleavage reaction on chitin beads, the CBD coding region replaced the MBP coding region in the MSL fusion construct. The 5 native C-extein residues (SIEQD) were replaced with CRAMG so that C-terminal cleavage would generate T4 DNA ligase with an N-terminal cysteine. The tripartite fusion protein (BSL) consisting of CBD­Ssp mini-intein (Cys1Ala)­ T4 DNA ligase accumulated after induction of E. coli cells bearing pBSL-C155 at 30°C for 3 h. The clarified cell extract was loaded onto a chitin column ( Fig. 5B, lane 1) in column buffer at pH 8.5, which would inhibit cleavage during purification. Incubation of the column at 25°C in cleavage buffer at pH 7.0 for 16 h yielded single species T4 DNA ligase ( Fig. 5B, lane 4), with a yield of 5 mg/l of cell culture. 3.6. Intein-mediated protein ligation (IPL) An IPL reaction (Fig. 6) was performed by mixing and concentrating the MBP and T4 DNA ligase fractions generated by intein catalyzed cleavage on chitin beads. Quantitative ligation, with approx. 30% efficiency, was observed corresponding to the appearance on SDS­PAGE of a species of approx. 101 kDa,

Fig. 4. C-Terminal cleavage activities of the Ssp DnaB mini-intein mutants. The intein was expressed as a fusion protein (MSL, 119 kDa) consisting of the N-terminal maltose binding protein (M, 43 kDa), the Ssp mini-intein (S, 18 kDa) and T4 DNA ligase (L, 58 kDa). (A) In vivo C-terminal cleavage activities of the Ssp mini intein Ser155 mutants. All mutants also contained the C1A substitution to block N-terminal cleavage. In vivo C-terminal cleavage activities of the MSL mutants in crude cell extracts were analyzed by Coomassie Blue-stained 12% SDS­PAGE following induction of E. coli cells bearing pMSL-X155 at 30°C for 3 h. Cleavage activity was detected by a decrease in the full-length fusion protein MSL and the simultaneous increase of cleavage products MBP­intein (MS, 61 kDa) and T4 DNA ligase (L, 58 kDa). The amino acids at position 155 are indicated above each lane. Cell extract containing an expressed MBP­intein fusion protein (MS ) was loaded in the right-most lane. (B) pH-dependent cleavage at the intein C-terminal junction in MSL-I155.In vitro C-terminal cleavage of the MSL-I155 fusion protein was performed using protein samples purified on amylose resin.

expected for the MBP­T4 DNA ligase fusion (Fig. 5B, lane 7). The increase in MBP concentration increased the ligation efficiency for T4 DNA ligase to >70% (data not shown). Following purification on an amylose resin to remove unreacted T4 DNA ligase, the ligation sample was treated with factor Xa, which cleaves at a site 5 amino acids N-terminal to the fusion site, resulting in the generation of a 58 kDa species corresponding to T4 DNA ligase and an increase of MBP. N-Terminal sequencing of the 58 kDa species showed NH YGT2 LEGCRAMGYCOOH which matched the last five residues of MBP (GTLEG) followed by a linker sequence inserted between the C-terminus of the intein and the T4 DNA ligase coding region in pBSL-C155. The amy-

lose purified ligation fractions exhibited DNA ligase activity on HindIII restricted l phage DNA (data not shown).

4. Discussion The work described here represents several important advances in understanding protein splicing and modulating the inherent intein catalytic activities for use in protein purification and protein semisynthesis. Previous studies suggested that an intein plus the first C-extein residue contained all the catalytic residues required for splicing (Cooper et al., 1993; Davis et al., 1992; Xu

et al., 1993). On the other hand, splicing has been shown to be less efficient in a foreign protein context ( Xu et al., 1993). The extein residues could contribute to the highly coordinated splicing process by affecting the precise alignment of the two splice junctions and the orientation of the reacting groups. The evidence presented here indicates that the native glycine residue at the -1 position seems essential for efficient splicing of the Ssp mini-intein. Substitution of Gly-1 with Ala, Leu or Pro drastically affected splicing ( Fig. 2). The presence of a glycine residue favors thioester formation at Cys1, the initial step in the splicing pathway, resulting in the accumulation of a substantial amount (approx. 50%) of the linear thioester intermediate ( Fig. 3B). The accumulation of a large amount of thioester seems puzzling, since the equilibrium in peptides favors the amide form (Dawson et al., 1994; Tam et al., 1995; Shao et al., 1997). It is likely that a glycine residue is favorable for a cis conformation of the peptide bond between the -1 residue and Cys1 as suggested by the crystal structure of the GyrA intein from Mycobacterium xenopi

( Klabunde et al., 1998). It is also possible that the intervention by certain intein residues and the decor of the active site of the precursor protein could stabilize the thioester linkage. Previous studies of the Sce VMA intein showed that certain substitutions at the -1 position also affected splicing and accumulation of the thioester intermediate (Chong et al., 1998b). However, in contrast to the Ssp dnaB mini-intein, the Sce VMA intein with the native glycine at the -1 position has been shown to accumulate little linear thioester intermediate and the fusion protein seems very stable in the absence of thiol compound or hydroxylamine (Chong et al., 1996, 1998b). Therefore, accumulation of a large amount of thioester intermediate may not be essential for efficient splicing since the acyl rearrangement at Cys1 is tightly coupled with transesterification. The data also show that other native N-extein residues (-2 to -5) and C-extein residues (156­159) flanking the Ssp DnaB intein appeared to have more subtle effects on splicing and cleavage reactions ( Table 1 and Fig. 2). In most cases, the mutant proteins still

Fig. 6. Intein-mediated protein ligation (IPL) system. The IPL method uses genetically engineered intein vectors to express and purify a protein of interest (N ) fused to the N-terminus of an intein or a protein of interest (C ) fused to the C-terminus of an intein. Cleavage of the expressed fusion proteins on chitin matrix releases the N-terminal target protein with a C-terminal thioester (by the pathway on the left) or the C-terminal target protein with an N-terminal cysteine (by the pathway on the right). An N-terminal cleavage vector expresses a target protein­intein(Asn154Ala)­ chitin binding domain (CBD) fusion protein. Incubation with a thiol compound, 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA), results in cleavage of the peptide bond preceding the intein N-terminus (Cys1) and the linkage of MESNA to the C-terminus of the target protein by a thioester bond. The C-terminal cleavage vector expresses a CBD­intein (Cys1Ala)­target protein. Cleavage of the peptide bond following the intein C-terminal Asn154 releases the target protein with an N-terminal cysteine residue. When the two proteins with complementary reactive groups are mixed, a chemoselective reaction and subsequent spontaneous S­N acyl rearrangement results in an amide bond between the reacting proteins (Dawson et al., 1994; Tam et al., 1995).

exhibited efficient in vivo splicing. The inhibition of splicing in the I156P mutant could be due to its steric effect on the structure or the orientation of Ser155 (the branch point residue). Furthermore, in the context of the C1A mutation, the replacement of the five native C-extein residues in pBSL-C155 resulted in the accumulation of substantially more precursor (Fig. 5B), while

a single S155C substitution exhibited proficient in vivo C-terminal cleavage (Fig. 4A). Since the two splice junctions must align precisely to form an active site pocket during splicing, it is possible to modulate N-terminal cleavage at Cys1 by substitution of the intein C-terminal Asn154. Indeed, substitution of Asn154 blocked splicing as well as C-terminal cleavage

12

and resulted in different rates of in vivo N-terminal cleavage, which presumably requires an N­S acyl rearrangement at Cys1 and subsequent hydrolysis. Ala, Met, Val, Glu, Thr, Cys, Ser, and Gln mutants were characterized by rapid N-terminal cleavage, reflecting facile formation of a thioester at Cys1. On the other hand, substitution with Pro, Lys or Leu resulted in substantial down-modulation of in vivo cleavage activity but still allows thiol induced cleavage in vitro (data not shown). These residues may have steric and electrostatic effects on the acyl shift at Cys1 and on the hydrolysis of the thioester bond. Cyclization of Asn154 appeared to be substantially affected by the side chains following the scissile peptide bond. It is not unexpected that serine and cysteine are among the most favorable residues for C-terminal cleavage since these residues are highly conserved as the first C-extein residue among inteins (Perler et al., 1997; Pietrokovski, 1998). Although it is believed that these residues participate only in the preceding catalytic steps, inteins must have evolved to adopt these residues, along with the neighboring sequence, to accommodate cyclization of asparagine in the highly coordinated splicing process. Other favorable residues include Ala and Gly with short aliphatic side chains, histidine with an imidazole ring, sulfur-containing Met, and Asp and Glu with negatively charged side chains. Phe, Tyr, and Trp with aromatic side chains also showed moderate activity. Amino acids, Val, Thr, Leu and Ile with longer aliphatic side chains, Gln and Asn with amide-containing side chains, Arg and Lys with basic side chains, and Pro are not favorable for in vivo cleavage. The inhibitory effects from certain types of amino-acid side chains could be due to steric and electrostatic interference resulting in misalignment of the reacting groups required for cyclization of Asn154. It has been observed previously that splicing of the intein from the Pyrococcus species GB-D DNA polymerase is favorable at pH 6 and can be completely inhibited at pH 9 ( Xu et al., 1993). Our in vitro analysis of the precursor proteins showed for the first time that the C-terminal cleavage reaction, which accounts for the branch resolution step in the splicing pathway, is pH-dependent, with a favorable pH in the range of 6.0­7.5. The highly conserved penultimate histidine residue appeared to be crucial for C-terminal cleavage. Mutation of the penultimate histidine inhibited splicing and C-terminal cleavage ( Xu and Perler, 1996; Chong et al, 1996, 1998b). Our preliminary data showed that mutation of His153 in the Ssp DnaB mini-intein completely blocked C-terminal cleavage in vivo and in vitro. However, the detailed catalysis involved in cyclization of Asn154 has yet to be worked out by further mutagenesis study and a precise crystal structure of a precursor protein. We have demonstrated that large recombinant proteins can be readily generated as protein building blocks by the intein self-catalyzed, highly specific cleavage

reaction (Fig. 6). Autoproteolytic N-terminal or C-terminal cleavage mutants can be used as protein fusion partners and applied in generating proteins with a C-terminal thioester and proteins possessing an N-terminal cysteine for protein ligation. Proteins fused to either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of an engineered Ssp mini-intein could be purified in a single chromatographic step, in conjunction with the use of a chitin binding domain. The MBP protein fused to the N-terminus of the intein, carrying an N154A substitution, can be freed from chitin either by thiol induced cleavage of the fusion protein at 4°C or by incubation at 25°C at pH 8.0 presumably due to hydrolysis ( Fig. 5A). Cleavage by hydrolysis would allow purification of thiol sensitive proteins. The cleavage reaction induced by MESNA can generate a thioester at the C-terminus of MBP for ligation with a peptide with an N-terminal cysteine (Evans et al., 1998; Muir et al., 1998). Furthermore, in order to increase the yield, intein mutants with Leu, Lys or Pro in place of Ala154 could be utilized to reduce in vivo cleavage activity. Modulation of C-terminal cleavage activity by mutation, pH and temperature provides a new approach to express and purify recombinant proteins. This C-terminal cleavage system is uniquely designed by substitution of Cys1 with Ala to block N-terminal cleavage so that only a single C-terminal cleavage reaction can occur. This system requires no proteolytic cleavage of the fusion proteins to separate the protein of interest and the fusion partner, as required by many affinity tag systems (Guan et al., 1988; Smith and Johnson, 1988; LaVallie and McCoy, 1995) nor a thiol reagent for induction of cleavage as in the previously described intein purification systems (Chong et al., 1997, 1998a). Fusion proteins can be simply purified at pH 8.5 and the protein of interest is eluted after incubation of the chitin column overnight at pH 7 at 25°C. Studies with BSL proteins carrying the Ser155 mutation indicated that reaction performed at 4°C for 3­5 days can also result in comparable yields (data not shown). In addition, the fusion of a protein of interest to the C-terminus of the intein may result in higher expression levels compared to the intein N-terminal fusion system. The pMSB and pBSL expression vectors strongly regulate the transcription initiation at the T7 promoter (Studier et al., 1990; Dubendorff and Studier, 1991). Most importantly, this system offers possibilities to generate proteins or peptides with a defined N-terminus (e.g., free of an N-terminal methionine residue) without the use of exogenous proteases. It is conceivable that in addition to protein purification, one of the major applications of this technique is the facile production of large bacterially expressed proteins possessing an N-terminal cysteine for protein ligation. It has recently been shown that an engineered mini intein of 134 residues from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was used to purify bacterially expressed proteins with an N-terminal

cysteine for protein­protein ligation ( Evans et al., 1999). The availability of an increasing number of inteins would allow the optimization of expression and cleavage efficiency for a variety of protein of interest. This inteinderived technology would greatly expand the application of intein-mediated protein ligation in protein semisynthesis and facilitate the design and production of novel proteins.
