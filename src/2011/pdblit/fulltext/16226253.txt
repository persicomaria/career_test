ABSTRACT : Fluorescence studies were carried out on a purified preparation of the ADP/ATP carrier protein solubilized in 3-laurylamido-N-N-dimethylpropylaminoxide. The intrinsic fluorescence of the protein was modified upon addition of ADP and ATP and specific inhibitory ligands (carboxyatractyloside and bongkrekic acid). The fluorescence was transitorily enhanced by micromolar concentrations of ADP or ATP. The rise in fluorescence lasted for 10 set at 25'C. It was suppressed by carboxyatractyloside and on the contrary enhanced by bongkrekic acid. These data were interpreted as reflecting conformational changes probably related to the functioning of the ADP/ATP carrier. Mg'+ inhibited the ADP- or ATP-induced rise in fluorescence, indicating that the free forms (and not the Mg++ complexed forms) of ADP and ATP are the true substrates for the ADP/ATP carrier.

MATERIALS

AND METHoDs

Nucleotides and carboxyatractyloside were purchased from Boehringer and a-B-methylene adenosine diphosphate (AOPCP) from Miles. Bongkrekic acid was prepared as in (5). Laurylamido-N-N-dimethylpropylaminoxide was synthetized as described in (6). The ADP/ATP carrier protein from beef heart mitochondria was prepared by chromatography on hydroxyapatite (Biorad) as described in (7), using pure laurylamido-N-N-dimethylpropylaminoxide as detergent instead of Aminoxid WS35. The pass-through fraction, which contained the protein, was diluted twice with 136 mM glycerol to give a final protein concentration ranging between 0.15 and 0.25 mg/ml ; the final pH was 6.5. This fraction was used for fluorescence measurements. All fluorescence measurements were made at 25"C. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer MPF 2A fluorimeter using a 1 x lcm fluorescence cuvette in 2 ml final volume (Fig. 1). Kinetics of fluorescence changes (Fig. 2-6) were measured with a DURRUM D117 fluorimeter as described in a recent paper (8). The protein fluorescence was excited at 295nm ; the emitted light was collected at 90° through quartz lenses and filtered with a O-54 Corning filter coupled to an ultraviolet light filter. The resulting band-pass was centered at 355 nm with a peak transmission of 75 % and a width of 60 nm at half maximum of the peak. With this set-up and efficient stirring there was virtually no photolysis within the time range of the experiments.
