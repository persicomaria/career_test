SUMMARY

The proton and oxygen affinity was studied of both human hemoglobin A and A~ over the p H region 5.5-9.o. This study revealed the following: I. The Bohr effect of hemoglobin A is identical to that of hemoglobin A s 2. There is no difference in the oxygen affinity between the two hemoglobins. 3. The oxygen binding curves of hemoglobin A and A s are identically affected by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. 4. His GI9(II7) fl in hemoglobin A has an abnormally high p K value of about 7.8 in both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin.

INTRODUCTION

Hemoglobin A 2 (Hb A2) is one of the minor human hemoglobins occurring in tile red cell hemolysate ; it has two a chains identical to those of the major component Hb A. The non a chains, the so called b chains, differ from the fl chains of H b A at IO sites in the amino acid sequence 1. Among these differences there are 3 replacements of polar residues: Glu B4(22)fi is replaced by Ala, His GI8(ii6)fl by Arg and His GI9(II7) fi by Asn'. Since the functional behavior of hemoglobin is closely related to its structure, H b A2 has been the subject of several studies 2-4. These studies have all presented evidence that in the region between p H 6.6 and 7.6 the Bohr effect, i.e. the mutual dependence of the oxygen and proton affinity of hemoglobin, is the same for both hemoglobins. They disagree, however, on whether Hb A 2 would show a higher affinity for oxygen than H b A or not. Eddison et al. a have found that both proteins exhibit the same oxygen affinity, while Huisman et al. s and Santa 4 reported that Hb As has a considerably higher oxygen affinity than normal Hb A.

Recently, we have presented evidence that of the two histidines which the fl chain has in excess t o the ~ chain, His GI 9 is titratable and His GI8 maskedS; since H b A and H b A s have identical Bohr effect, this His GI 9 should have the same p K in both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin A. In view of this and the above-mentioned discrepancy concerning the oxygen affinity of H b A s and Hb A, we have investigated both the p H dependence of the oxygen affinity and the oxygen-linked proton affinity of the two hemoglobins in the p H region 5.5-9.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

H u m a n hemoglobin was prepared from whole blood by the toluene method s . The two components A and A 2 were isolated by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, type A5o, as described earlier 5. The isolation procedure is a modification of the method of Bernini 7. The collected fractions were dialysed against distilled water and subsequently deionized by repeated passing through a mixed bed ion-exchange column (Amberlite IRA 400 and I R 12o). H ÷ titrations were carried out using the continuous automatic titration equipment described earlier s. Isoionic solutions of oxyhemoglobin As (pHiso ---- 7.60) were titrated to pH 6 and subsequently deoxygenated b y passing argon through the titration vessel. Hb As was deoxygenated at this pH, as the oxygen affinity at the isoionic p H is much higher than at p H 6. Titration results obtained after deoxygenating H b A s at p H 7.60 were not reproducible enough. This was probably due to only partial deoxygenation of the solution in the titration vessel. After deoxygenation the titration curve of deoxyhemoglobin A 2 was recorded up to p H 9. At this pH, by passing CO through, the deoxy form was converted into the carboxy form; subsequently the titration curve was recorded down to p H 6. Deoxyhemoglobin was converted into carboxyhemoglobin instead of into oxyhemoglobin in order to avoid oxidation into methemoglobin. The same procedure was applied for Hb A. As usual no differences could be detected in control experiments between the titration curves of oxy- and carboxyhemoglobin. Titrations were carried out at an ionic strength of o.I (KCI) at 25 °C. The hemoglobin concentrations were 8-lO -4 M (berne basis). The methemoglobin contamination amounted to only a few percent in all samples studied. Oxygen binding equilibria were measured spectrophotometrically 9. The oxygen binding curves were calculated applying the relations given by Benesch et al. TM. Oxygen was added to the tonometer (volume I 1) by injecting air using normal syringes. 0.05 M phosphate buffers were used below p H 8; above this p H we used borax buffers. The hemoglobin concentrations were about 5" lO-5 M. All hemoglobin concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically on the carboxy derivatives using a value for the extinction coefficient per mole heme, e, of 14 ooo at 54 ° n m .

The figure shows that, over the ptt region considered, the curves tbr carboxy- and deoxyhemoglobin A,~ lie above tile curves for carboxy- and deoxyhemoglobin A, respectively. "File results for Hb A are identical with those reported earlier s. The dift\~rence in protons bound (AZH) is about 2 at low pH and 3.5 at high pH (sue a/s() Fig. 2, where this difference in protons bound is plotted vs pH). This increase in difference in Z , is due t¢) the fact that, of the two histidines (;19 and GI8, only the first is titratable a. Since His (;19 ~ can compensate for the positive charge of Arg (;18 (~, Z m a x (the maximuln positive proton charge) will be equal fi)r both proteins. As a result, the presence of (;111 ;l~t l)osition B 4 in the fi chain, where tile 0 chain has an Aln residue, is found as tile difference in charge ()f about 2 at low pH.

Fig. 2 reveals further that tile titration behavior of His (ii 9 is very similar in both carboxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and t h a t in both forms its imidazole group has an abnormally high p K value of about 7.8. This similar behavior in both states is in agreement with the crystallographic d a t a of Perutz and co-workers n, which have shown t h a t this residue forms a saltbridge with Glu B8(26)fl both in carboxv -n and deoxyhemoglobin (Perutz, M. F., personal communication). Due to this saltbridge the p K of His GI 9 will be elevated in both forms. Fig. 3 shows the difference in protons bound (AZ) between the deoxy and c a r b o x y form of the two hemoglobins. The plot reflects the change in proton affinity of deoxyhemoglobin upon ligation. Since an identical Bohr effect for the two proteins, as presented in Fig. 3, does not mean t h a t t h e y would also show the same oxygen affinity, we measured the log/Sa0 vs p H curves. Tile results presented in Fig. 4 indicate t h a t hemoglobin A and A 2 have not only the same Bohr effect but also identical oxygen affinity when measured under the same conditions. This ()bservation is supported b y the oxygen binding equilibrium studies in the presence and absence of 2,3-

diphosphoglycerate. This polyanion binds strongly to the deoxy form only and has therefore a remarkable influence on the oxygen affinity of adult human hemoglobin12,1~. The binding site for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is on the dyad axis at the entrance of the central cavity, where the negative charges of the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate anion can form saltbridges with positively charged groups on the fl chains. These groups are very probably the two histidines H2I, the two terminal amino groups and the lysines E F 6 (ref. 14). Since hemoglobin A and A 2 have these groups in common, it could be expected that the oxygen affinity of both proteins would equally be affected by the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The results are presented in Fig. 5 and show that

the shift in oxygen affinity introduced by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is indeed equal for both H b A and A.,. Summarizing, we can say that from the data presented in the last three figures it can be concluded that H b A and A 2 are indistinguishable as far as the oxygen binding features are concerned. The difference in affinity reported for the two hemoglobins a,4 might be explained by assuming that 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, which can only partially be removed from the hemolysate by dialysis ~5, was still present in the isolated HI) A and A2 fraction though at different concentration, resulting in pseudo-heterogeneity in the oxygen affinity of the two proteins. In all our experiments 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is routinely removed by deionizing the solutions using the mixed bed ion-exchange column 1". The equal oxygen affinity of both hemoglobins indicates that the [$ and ~ chain when combined with the t t chain have the same functional behavior. Finally, we want to say something about the Bohr groups of Hb A. Up to now the amino group of the terminal valine of the a chain and the imidazole group of the terminal histidine of the/3 chain have been identified as Bohr groups. Together, they probably account for 70% of the total Bohr effecW, is. The group responsible for the remaining 30% has not yet been identified. As far as the fl chain is concerned, the only residues remaining as possible candidates for this group are His NA2, His FG 4 and His E F I . From these residues, His FG 4 is the most likely one, since it is in close contact with Tyr C6(4~)a at the alfll interface n, which undergoes large changes upon oxygenation. Measurement of the Bohr effect of Hb Malm6, in which His FG4 is replaced by Asn l'q could be conclusive in this respect. If this henloglobin showed a normal Bohr effect, then the still missing Bohr group should be looked for among the histidines of the a chain; one of these histidines, His H5(I22)a, is proposed by P e r u t # 4 as a possible Bohr group.
