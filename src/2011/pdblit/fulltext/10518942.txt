These observations suggest that DNA methylation also functions as a genome integrity system. In addition, DNA methylation has been linked to several human neurodevelopmental syndromes, such as Rett, fragile X, and ICF syndromes, which result from mutations in factors involved in DNA methylation (Robertson and Wolffe, 2000). In many cases, sites of DNA methylation are recognized by a family of protein factors that contain conserved methyl-CpG binding domains (MBDs). To date, five family members have been characterized in mammals and Xenopus laevis: MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4 (Figure 1A) (Hendrich and Bird, 1998; Wade et al., 1999; Ballestar and Wolffe, 2001). These MBDcontaining proteins bind specifically to methyl-CpG pairs, except for mammalian MBD3 and X. laevis MBD3 LF. Studies have shown that MBD binds DNA as a monomer, and that binding is independent of the DNA sequence surrounding the methyl-CpG site (Hendrich and Bird, 1998; Ballestar and Wolffe, 2001). MBD-containing proteins function by recruiting various complexes to methyl-CpG sites. For example, MeCP2 simultaneously binds the Sin3-histone deacetylase complex via its transcriptional repression domain and promoters containing methylated CpG sequences, resulting in deacetylation of core histones and subsequent transcriptional silencing (Nan et al., 1998; Jones et al., 1998). Likewise, MBD2 and MBD3 reside in distinct complexes in the mammalian cell, which link DNA methylation with chromatin modification and transcriptional repression. MBD2 is associated with the MeCP1, a large multisubunit complex that contains the first identified binding affinity to methylated DNA (Meehan et al., 1989; Ng et al., 1999). MBD3 forms an Mi-2/NuRD complex with nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities (Wade et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1999). Mi-2/ NuRD has no significant affinity for methylated DNA, but can be tethered to it in the presence of MBD2. MBD1 is a transcriptional regulator, characterized by two or three CXXC domains, that binds methylated CpG islands from the tumor suppressors p16, VHL, and E-cadherin, and imprinted SNRPN genes (Cross et al., 1997; Fujita et al., 1999). MBD1 inhibits the promoter activities of these genes in a methylation-dependent manner through cooperation of the MBD, CXXC, and transcriptional repression domains (Ng et al., 2000; Fujita et al., 2000). The repression mechanism of MBD1 may involve deacetylation, as the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A can partly overcome the repression (Ng et al., 2000). In contrast to the other family members, MBD4 contains an enzymatic domain within its polypeptide chain, and can function by itself as a thymine glycosylase that removes the deamination product at methyl-CpG sites (Hendrich et al., 1999).

Summary In vertebrates, the biological consequences of DNA methylation are often mediated by protein factors containing conserved methyl-CpG binding domains (MBDs). Mutations in the MBD protein MeCP2 cause the neurodevelopmental disease Rett syndrome. We report here the solution structure of the MBD of the human methylation-dependent transcriptional regulator MBD1 bound to methylated DNA. DNA binding causes a loop in MBD1 to fold into a major and novel DNA binding interface. Recognition of the methyl groups and CG sequence at the methylation site is due to five highly conserved residues that form a hydrophobic patch. The structure indicates how MBD may access nucleosomal DNA without encountering steric interference from core histones, and provides a basis to interpret mutations linked to Rett syndrome in MeCP2. Introduction DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides is a major epigenetic modification of mammalian genomes and is important for the regulation of gene activity, genomic stability, and chromatin structure (Chen et al., 1998; Bird and Wolffe, 1999). Differences in DNA-methylation status have been correlated with diverse biological events, including genome imprinting, inactivation of the X chromosome, embryonic development, and carcinogenesis (Ballobio and Willard, 1992; Surani, 1998; Xu et al., 1999; Costello et al., 2000). Several lines of evidence, albeit indirectly, indicate that DNA methylation may also be linked to suppression of transcriptional noise, homologous recombination, transposon mobilization, and parasitic DNA expression (Bird and Wolffe, 1999; Robertson and Wolffe, 2000).

The methyl-CpG site is highlighted in red.

Further importance has been attached to the MBD and MBD-containing proteins since the discovery that Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the methylCpG binding protein MeCP2 (Amir et al., 1999). Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disease, and a leading cause of mental retardation and autistic behavior in females. Mutational data has been rapidly accumulating for MeCP2 (reviewed by Van den Veyver and Zoghbi, 2000; Dragich et al., 2000), and mutations of more than 17 different residues have been found so far. Intriguingly, 11 missense mutations cluster on the MBD, further emphasizing the importance of this domain. A central step to understanding the molecular mechanism of the DNA methylation system would be to determine how the methylation signal is read by MBD-containing proteins. Previous analyses, including structural determinations of the unliganded MBDs of MBD1 and MeCP2 by us and others, have suggested that the basic conserved protein surface and a loop may form the interfacial surface with methylated DNA (Ohki et al., 1999; Wakefield et al., 1999); however, the mode of protein-DNA interaction remains largely unknown. Here, we report the solution structure of the MBD of human MBD1 in complex with methylated DNA. We also present mutational binding data that confirm many of the key interactions observed between MBD and DNA in the NMR structure. The structure explains how MBD can access exposed CpG sites on nucleosome cores without encountering steric interference from core histones, and also provides a basis to interpret rapidly accumulating mutational data for MeCP2 from patients suffering from Rett syndrome.

Results and Discussion Structure Determination A section of human MBD1 encompassing the N-terminal MBD domain (residues 1­75) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, isotopically labeled, and purified (Figure 1A). The recombinant protein, which binds specifically to a methyl-CpG site, was mixed at a 1:1 stoichiometry with a 12 bp palindromic duplex oligonucleotide containing a methyl-CpG pair (Figure 1B). Preliminary DNA binding analysis by electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that this oligonucleotide is sufficiently long for the methylation-dependent binding of the MBD (data not shown). The complex formed between the 15Nlabeled MBD and the 12 bp oligonucleotide exhibited an excellent 1H-15N HSQC spectrum that differed from the unliganded MBD spectrum. The structure of the MBD-DNA complex was determined from a total of 2022 distance and torsional angle restraints, including 91 intermolecular NOE restraints (Figure 2A and Supplemental Table S1, available online at http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/105/3/487/DC1). Figure 3A depicts the protein backbone and DNA heavy atoms of the final 20 structures derived from the NMR data, showing that the atomic coordinates of residues 3­69 of the protein and base pairs 3­10 of the DNA have been well defined. The statistics of the structures are listed in Table S1. Structure of the MBD The MBD in the complex folds into an / sandwich structure comprising a layer of twisted sheet, backed

by another layer formed by the 1 helix and a hairpin loop at the C terminus (Figure 3B). These layers are both amphipathic, with the 1 helix and the sheet lying parallel and the hydrophobic faces tightly packed against each other. The sheet is composed of two long inner strands ( 2 and 3) sandwiched by two shorter outer strands ( 1 and 4). The section of the inner strands that projects beyond the outer strands is embedded in the major groove at the target DNA site and, together with the loop (L1) that links 2 and 3, forms the principal DNA interface (Figure 3B). Loop L1 undergoes major structural rearrangements upon binding DNA: its flexible loop conformation adopts a well defined hairpin-like structure. The rest of the DNAbound MBD has a similar structure to that of the unliganded MBDs of MBD1 and MeCP2 (Ohki et al., 1999; Wakefield et al., 1999). The measured {1H}-15N NOE values for residues in loop L1 in the complex (0.74 0.06) are comparable to those found in the / structured regions, whereas the NOE values for the L1 residues in the unliganded MBD are much smaller (0.32 0.15; Figure 2B), clearly indicating the presence of an induced fit. The induced hairpin-like structure results from extensive contacts between the loop and the major groove of DNA; seven of the nine residues in loop L1 contribute to an interface with just one of the two DNA strands (Figures 1A and 3B). The other DNA strand contributes to a second major interface with residues 44­48 of MBD, comprising loop L2 and the N-terminal part of helix 1 (Figures 1A and 3B). Loop L2 is inserted into the DNA major groove, with all its residues projecting outward to make important base contacts. By contrast, residues in the N-terminal part of helix 1 interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone, orientating the N-terminal end of this helix toward the DNA backbone, as often seen in protein-DNA complexes. These contacts to base and backbone anchor an edge of the sheet and the N-terminal part of the 1 helix to the DNA. In the complex, the DNA is unbent

and displays features typical of a B form duplex, except for a slight widening of the major groove at the MBD contact site. The heavy atoms in base pairs 3­10 in the complex have a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) from ° standard B form DNA of 1.5 A. Recognition of the Methyl-CpG Site The two methyl groups in the methyl-CpG site are distinguished by major groove contacts made by five MBD residues, Val-20, Arg-22, Tyr-34, Arg-44, and Ser-45, which form a continuous hydrophobic patch that mediates the contacts (Figures 3C and 4A). Apart from Val20, these amino acids are invariant in all functional MBD family members. The lack of symmetry in the methylcontacting interface indicates that each of the two methyl groups is recognized in a distinct manner (Figure 4B). The methyl group of m5C6 packs into a pocket formed by the hydrophobic side chains of Val-20 and Tyr-34, and an aliphatic portion of the Arg-22 side chain. The other methyl group, m5C18, makes hydrophobic contacts with aliphatic portions of the conserved Arg44 and Ser-45 residues. These interfacial contacts are deduced from 19 intermolecular NOE observations between the methyl groups and these five residues (Figure 2A). Recognition of the two guanine bases, G7 and G19, at the methyl-CpG site, results from interactions with Arg-22 and Arg-44. The guanidinium of Arg-22 is poised to donate a hydrogen bond to G7, being held in position by a hydrogen bond-salt bridge interaction with the carboxylate of conserved Asp-32 (Figures 4A and 4B). Arg22 also donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate located between C5 and m5C6 through its -NH, thus contributing to interfaces with both the base and backbone of the DNA. To G19, the guanidinium group of Arg44 is in a position to donate a hydrogen bond, buttressed by the aromatic ring of Tyr-34. These interfacial contacts are significant to recognition, as substitution of Arg-22 or Arg-44 with either alanine or lysine abolishes DNA

binding (Figure 4C). In addition, the side chain-side chain contacts to Arg-22 and Arg-44 provided by Asp-32 and Tyr-34, respectively, are crucial for generating the correct interfacial surface. The existence and importance of the Asp-32-Arg-22 interaction has been shown by mutagenesis; substitution of Asp-32 with alanine significantly impairs DNA binding, even though Asp-32 appears not to make a direct contact with DNA (Figure 4C). Specificity for the m5C:G base pair is further conferred by Tyr-34; its side chain hydroxyl group is poised to accept a hydrogen bond from the 4-amino group of m5C6 (Figure 4A). The existence of this bond is supported by mutagenesis of Tyr-34 to phenylalanine or alanine, either of which markedly decreases the affinity for methylated DNA, suggesting that the Tyr-34 hydroxyl group participates in DNA binding (Figure 4C). This result indicates that the amino acid at position 34, along with the amino acid at position 30, may account for the different affinities of mammalian and X. laevis MBD3 for methylated DNA. Mammalian MBD3, which does not bind to methyl-CpG (Hendrich and Bird, 1998), has phenylala-

nine and histidine at positions 34 and 30, respectively (MBD1 numbering; Figure 1A). In contrast, X. laevis MBD3, which is capable of binding specifically to a methyl-CpG site (Wade et al., 1999), has tyrosine and lysine at positions 34 and 30, respectively, which are homologous to the residues in functional MBD family members. Mutation of the patch residue, Ser-45, to alanine, also causes a reduction in DNA binding (Figure 4C). None of the mutants shown in Figure 4C showed evidence of a disruption in their overall fold caused by the mutation, as judged by NMR (see Experimental Procedures). Taken together, recognition of the methyl-CpG site appears to be the result exclusively of hydrophobic and polar contacts made by the five patch residues. Base contacts by MBD are limited to the m5CG sequence within the major groove. Contacts to the DNA Backbone Most of the contacts to the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone are made by residues in loop L1 and helix 1. Loop L1 (residues 22­30), which becomes ordered upon DNA

binding, spreads out from the body of the protein, its tip latching onto the DNA backbone of one strand (Figure 3B). The invariant Gly-25 forms a characteristic sharp turn at the extreme of the loop, and the main chain amide groups of its neighboring residues (Lys-23, Ser24, Ala-26 and Thr-27) are favorably positioned to donate hydrogen bonds to either of the two phosphates located between C5 and G7 (Figure 4B). Some of these residues on the loop make simultaneous hydrophobic contacts with the backbone sugars. Helix 1 contributes its three N-terminal residues to the interface with the backbone of the other DNA strand. These contacts orient the N-terminal end of this helix toward the DNA backbone, permitting a favorable interaction of the helix dipole with the negatively charged DNA backbone. As in other DNA binding proteins, several arginine and lysine residues interact with the negatively charged DNA backbone including Arg-18, Lys-23, Arg-30, Arg-42, Lys46, Arg-51, and Lys-65 (Figure 4B). The importance of Arg-30, Lys-46, and Lys-65 to DNA binding has been shown by alanine substitutions, which significantly decreased DNA binding in each case (Figure 4C). By con-

trast, conservative substitution of Arg-30 to lysine has little effect on DNA binding, presumably because the positively charged side chain of lysine can make a similar contact with the DNA backbone. However, lysine substitution of either Arg-22 or Arg-44 abolishes DNA binding, revealing that the guanidinium groups of these residues are crucial for base discrimination as predicted from the complex structure (Figure 4C). The backbone interaction is further stabilized by two 1 helix residues, Val-47 and Glu-48, that make hydrophobic contacts with deoxyribose rings of C17 and m5C18, respectively (Figure 4B).

The Protein-DNA Interfacial Area A remarkable feature of the MBD-DNA interaction is its small contact area. The calculated change in solventaccessible surface area of the MBD upon DNA binding ° is only 810 A2, which is much smaller than the average ° value of 1340 A2 calculated for nine monomeric proteins (Jones et al., 1999). This small value reflects the fact that the MBD contacts DNA exclusively within a narrow

Figure 5. The Protein-DNA Interfacial Area (A) The MBD-DNA contacts lie exclusively within the major groove of DNA. The surface of the protein is viewed from the minor groove side at the methyl-CpG site. Residues interacting with DNA bases and the sugar-phosphate backbone are shown in red and blue, respectively. (B) A model of the MBD-nucleosome core complex, constructed from the solution structure of the MBD-DNA and the crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle (Luger et al., 1997). The MBDs are shown in yellow, core histones in blue, DNA bases in gray, and DNA backbone in white. This model illustrates that the MBD can access methyl-CpG sites exposed in the major groove on nucleosome cores without encountering steric interference from the core histones. (C) Schematic ribbon diagrams comparing DNA complexes of the MBD (left), Tn916-INT (middle) (PDB code 1B69; Wojciak et al., 1999), and AtERF1 (right) (PDB code 1GCC; Allen et al., 1998). The N and C termini are labeled. Residues interacting with DNA bases and the sugarphosphate backbone are shown in red and blue, respectively.

area of the major groove of the duplex, and that no part of the protein invades the minor groove side (Figure 5A). This limited interfacial contact area of DNA is probably necessary for MBD to bind efficiently to nucleosomal DNA. The crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle shows that all the core histone/DNA interactions occur at inward-facing DNA backbone segments or in the minor groove of the outward-facing parts of the DNA (Luger et al., 1997). Parts of the N-terminal tails of histones H2A, H2B, and H3 are embedded in the outward-facing minor grooves, leaving adjacent major grooves untouched. Restricting the MBD contact area to the DNA major groove is therefore advantageous; it means that the MBD can access methyl-CpG sites exposed in the major groove on nucleosome cores without encountering steric interference from any part of the core histones. In the crystal structure, the histone N-terminal tails of the nucleosome structure are not acetylated; thus, the

structure is regarded to be in a "compact and inactive" state. Model building using the coordinates of the nucleosome core (PDB code 1AOI) and the MBD-DNA complex reveal that the infrastructure of the nucleosome permits the MBD to coexist on the nucelosome with nonacetylated core histones (Figure 5B). Indeed, Chandler et al. (1999) have shown that the MBD of MeCP2 can bind to methyl-CpG sites exposed in the major groove of nucleosomal DNA without major impediment. This ability to bind to nucleosomal DNA characterizes the MBD-containing proteins as members of an unusual group of proteins that include the glucocorticoid receptor, the thyroid hormone receptor, HNF3, and histone H1 (Chandler et al. 1999). In contrast to histone H1, however, MBD binding to the nucleosome does not appear to cause rearrangement of the core histone contacts with DNA (Guschin et al., 1998; Lee and Hayes, 1998; Chandler et al., 1999). Because the contact surface between the DNA and MBD is small, the fold of the

The area of the negatively charged surface is circled by a dotted line. For comparison, the electrostatic potential on the protein surface of the MBD1 MBD-DNA complex is shown (right).

MBD-bound DNA probably deviates little from that of standard B form DNA. Comparison with Other DNA Binding Proteins The secondary structure organization of MBD has similarity to those of several other DNA binding proteins (Ohki et al., 1999). Both the DNA binding domains of Tn916 integrase (Tn916-INT) and a GCC-box binding protein, AtERF1, have a sandwich structure formed by a three-stranded sheet and a C-terminal helix, resembling the MBD (Figure 5C) (Allen et al., 1998; Wojciak et al., 1999), despite no apparent sequence similarity between the MBD and these proteins. The mode of DNA binding of the MBD is, nevertheless, different from those seen with Tn916-INT and AtERF1. In the complexes of Tn916-INT and AtERF1, the face of three-stranded sheet lies flat in the DNA major groove

with every other side chain pointing toward the DNA, making extensive contacts with four and five base-pairs and the backbone of the DNA (Figure 5C) (Connolly et al., 2000). These sheet residues dominate binding in the major groove. In the Tn916-INT complex, a loop following the sheet is positioned in the minor groove to make additional electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone. In addition, the C-terminal helices of both Tn916-INT and AtERF1 are remote from the interface (Connolly et al., 2000). Striking differences can be seen in the MBD-DNA complex. The heavily twisted sheet is positioned slantingly within the major groove to wedge the C-terminal part of strand 4, rather than lying flat in the groove (Figure 5C). This orientation of the sheet of the MBD allows helix 1 and loop L2 to mediate major groove contacts with DNA. The largest interface with DNA is

Cell 494

made by residues in L1; by contrast, there is no counterpart of L1 in Tn916-INT or AtERF1. All the contacts made by the MBD are confined within the major groove and backbone, and involve only two base pairs of DNA (m5C6 and G7); thus no minor groove contact was observed. Rett Syndrome: Mutations in MeCP2 The strong conservation of residues that are important for DNA binding and structural integrity of the domain suggests that the folding and mode of DNA interaction are similar throughout the MBD family. The structure of the MBD-DNA complex thus allows us to interpret the rapidly accumulating mutational data for MeCP2 in patients suffering from Rett syndrome, a leading cause of mental retardation and autistic behavior in females. We constructed a model of the MeCP2 MBD-DNA complex by best-fit superposition of the coordinates of the unliganded MeCP2 MBD (PDB code 1QK9; Wakefield et al., 1999) to those of the MBD1 MBD bound to DNA, as shown in Figure 6. The root-mean-square deviation between the DNA-bound MBD of MBD1 and ° the unliganded MBD of MeCP2 is 1.46 A over 23 C coordinates for residues in the 2, 3, and 4 strands and the 1 helix. Because the loop equivalent to L1 of MBD1 (residues 111­119 in MeCP2) has no known Rett mutation site, DNA contacts mediated by this loop are not discussed here, and the structural rearrangement that this loop would undergo upon DNA binding has not been considered in the model. Omitting this loop, all protein residues that make base contacts and most of the residues that make backbone contacts are located at similar positions, relative to the DNA, in the MBDDNA complex and in the model (Figure 6A), suggesting the validity of our model. Our model is also consistent with previous chemical shift perturbation and mutational data for MeCP2 (Wakefield et al., 1999; Ballestar et al., 2000; Free et al., 2001). Substitutions of more than 17 different residues have been reported in MeCP2, 11 of which are in the MBD, as shown in Figure 1A (Amir et al., 1999; Van den Veyver and Zoghbi, 2000). The MeCP2 residues Arg-133 and Ser-134, which are mutated in some cases of Rett syndrome, are positioned in close vicinity to DNA bases in the model (Figure 6B) and are equivalent to Arg-44 and Ser-45 of MBD1--two of the five residues that form the hydrophobic methyl binding pockets in the MBD1-DNA complex (Figures 1A and 4B). Therefore, it is logical to suggest that either of these Rett mutations causes defects in contacting the DNA bases, and thus in reading the methylation site. In fact, the Rett mutation R133C has been shown to reduce the DNA binding of MeCP2 significantly (Yusufzai and Wolffe, 2000; Free et al., 2001). Another residue of MeCP2 at a Rett mutation site, Ala-140, is not conserved between MeCP2 and MBD1; and the corresponding residue of MBD1, Arg-51, makes a backbone contact in the DNA complex. In the model of the MeCP2 MBD-DNA complex, Ala-140 is located relatively near the DNA backbone (Figure 6B); therefore, the Rett mutation of Ala-140 to valine might cause reduced DNA binding affinity through the introduction of valine's bulky side chain. Five other MeCP2 residues found in the Rett mutation sites, Pro-101, Arg-106, Leu-124, Pro-152, and Phe-155,

are well conserved among the MBD family, but are located away from the DNA interface. Rett mutations affecting these MeCP2 residues likely have global structural consequences, because they are presumably important for proper folding or for maintaining the protein's structure in both MBD1 and MeCP2 (Figure 6B) (Ohki et al., 1999; Wakefield et al., 1999; Ballestar et al., 2000; Free et al., 2001). The mutations R106W and F155S have been shown to cause a disruption of the MBD fold (Ballestar et al., 2000; Free et al., 2001) The remaining three residues at known Rett mutation sites, Asp-97, Asp-156 and Thr-158, are clustered at the protein surface away from the DNA interface (Figures 6B and 6C); however, on the basis of their side chain location, mutations at these residues are unlikely to cause global conformational changes or large reductions in DNA binding. In fact, previous experiments have shown that the Rett mutation T158M causes little reduction in its binding affinity for methylated DNA, compared with the Rett mutation R133C, which reduces DNA binding significantly (Ballestar et al., 2000; Free et al., 2001). In the MBD family, only MeCP2 and MBD4 possess a threonine at position 158 (MeCP2 numbering) (Ballestar et al., 2000); MBD1 has a lysine that contributes to the DNA backbone interaction (Lys-65 in MBD1; Figure 1A). Adjacent to Thr-158, residues at two Rett mutation sites, Asp-97 and Asp-156, form a negatively charged surface opposite to the DNA interface, together with Glu-143, Asp-147, Asp-151, and Asp-154 (Figure 6C). Apart from Glu-143, these residues are conserved between mammalian and X. laevis MeCP2 but not between other MBD family members, indicating that this surface is unique to the MBD of MeCP2 (Figure 1A). This region of MeCP2 is made up of the N- and C-terminal residues of the MBD sequence, and its tertiary structure is significantly different from the corresponding part of MBD1 (Figure 6C). These observations suggest that Thr158 and this negatively charged region may be involved in a specific function of MeCP2, such as interacting with another protein factor or with another domain within MeCP2. Conclusion Methyl-CpG binding proteins have been something of an enigma; the recognition site is extremely short and can only be distinguished efficiently by the presence of two methyl groups (Hendrich and Bird, 1998; Ballestar and Wolffe, 2001). The extensive interactions between protein side chains and DNA bases that we have determined here reveal a basis for recognizing symmetric methyl-CpG sequences. The absence of apparent baseprotein contacts outside the dinucleotide sequence is consistent with the observation that MBD binding is independent of the DNA bases surrounding the CG sequence. Finally, our structure provides a framework for further studies of Rett syndrome by facilitating the interpretation of the accumulating mutational data on MeCP2.
Experimental Procedures NMR Sample Preparation 15 N-labeled and 15N/13C-labeled GST-MBD11­75 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5 grown in synthetic media

containing 15NH4Cl and 15NH4Cl/13C-glucose, respectively, and purified. After cleavage with thrombin, MBD11­75 with an extra Gly-Ser sequence at its N terminus, referred to as MBD, was further purified by chromatography. A sample of perdeuterated, 15N-labeled MBD containing only Arg residues labeled with 13C, 15N, and 1H was obtained by growing E. coli in media (90 atom% D2O) supplemented with 100 mg/liter 13C, 15N-labeled Arg. The palindromic 12-mer oligonucleotide containing a methyl-CpG sequence at natural isotopic abundance was synthesized chemically and annealed. The MBDDNA complex was formed by titrating the oligonucleotide into the protein. Changes in the amide group resonances of the protein in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum and in the imino proton resonances of DNA were used to indicate a 1:1 stoichiometry. The complex was concentrated using a Centricon column for NMR. The MBD-DNA complex was in slow exchange on the chemical-shift timescale. Samples for NMR measurements typically comprised 1.3 mM MBDDNA complex in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 5 mM DTT.

intermolecular NOEs. For the protein, cross peaks due to the chemical exchange process were not observed. Backbone torsion angle (, ) restraints in / structure regions were estimated by the backbone vicinal coupling constants (3JHN,H ) or by a database search procedure based on backbone chemical shifts, using the program TALOS (Cornilescu et al., 1999). The torsion angles 1 of Trp-15, Tyr-35, Tyr-52, Phe-62, and Phe-64 were estimated from the 3JC C and 3JNC coupling constants. Those of Asp-7, Arg-22, Asp-32, and Tyr-34 were estimated from 3JNH , 3JC C and/or 3 JH H couplings, obtained from HNHB, HN(CO)CO, and HACAHB spectra (Vuister et al., 1998).

NMR Spectroscopy NMR spectra were acquired at 303 K using Bruker DMX500, DRX500, or DRX800 NMR spectrometers. For assignments of the protein 1H, 15 N, and 13C resonances, a series of three-dimensional (3D) experiments (HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY) was performed (Cavanagh et al., 1996). Assignment of 1H chemical shifts of the DNA duplex was obtained from analysis of 2D ( 1, 2)-13C-filtered NOESY and TOCSY experiments. The stereospecific assignment of Leu and Val methyl groups was achieved using a 15% fractionally 13C-labeled protein. (H )C (C C )H and (H )C (C C C )H experiments were used to assign aromatic proton resonances. Interproton distances within the DNA were derived from 2D 1 H/1H NOE spectra and ( 1, 2)-13C-filtered NOE spectra, at a mixing time of 40 ms. Interproton distances within the protein were derived from 3D 15N- or 13C-separated or 4D 15N, 13C- or 13C, 13C-separated NOESY experiments, with a mixing time of 100 ms (Cavanagh et al., 1996). Intermolecular NOEs observable in D2O were identified using 3D 13C-filtered/13C-separated NOE spectrum at a mixing time of 100 ms. Then, intermolecular interproton distances were derived from 2D ( 2)-13C-filtered NOE spectra, and 2D 1H/1H NOE spectra, at a mixing time of 40 ms. Intermolecular interproton distance restraints, including protein main chain or Arg -protons, were identified using the 3D 15N-separated NOE spectrum of perdeuterated, 15N-labeled MBD11­75 containing only Arg residues labeled with 13C, 15N, and 1H. Assignment of arginine guanidinium 1H and 15N chemical shifts was obtained, using the same sample, as described previously (Yamazaki et al., 1995). Although the MBD-DNA complex is in slow exchange on the chemical-shift timescale, observation of NOESY cross peaks arising from chemical exchange of the two DNA strands at a mixing time of 120 ms revealed that there was stochastic reversal in the orientation of the bound MBD relative to the DNA duplex. In the complex, the asymmetric MBD monomer is bound to the symmetric doublestranded oligonucleotide; thus, each strand of the DNA interacts with the MBD in a distinctly different way, exhibiting chemical shifts that are different from those of the opposite strand. Therefore, reversal in the orientation of the bound MBD during the NOESY mixing time generates cross peaks, as has been seen, for example, in the case of the HIV Protease/inhibitor KNI-529 (Katoh et al., 1999). At a mixing time of 120 ms, we observed several cross peaks in the NOESY spectra, arising from a combined effect of chemical exchange and NOE. We distinguished cross peaks due to chemical exchange by measuring NOE spectra at a variety of mixing times (40, 60, and 120 ms) over a range of temperatures (from 15 to 35 C), as described previously (Katoh et al., 1999). The build-up rates of these exchange-originating cross peaks were found to be strongly temperature-dependent, increasing as the temperature rose. We 2.5 kHz, mixing time 40 also measured ROESY spectra ( B1 ms) to identify cross peaks arising solely from chemical exchange. Intensities of cross peaks that arose from a combined effect of the chemical exchange and NOE were sufficiently small in NOE spectra at a mixing time of 40 ms; thus, all interproton distances within the DNA and those between the protein and the DNA were derived at this mixing time. Despite this technical difficulty, we collected 91

Structure Determination The structures of the MBD-DNA complex were calculated with simulated annealing protocols, using XPLOR (Bruenger, 1993). The NOE connectivities within the protein, and between the protein and DNA, were categorized by strong, medium, weak, and very weak cross peaks, and assumed to correspond to the upper limits for proton° proton distances of 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 A, respectively. Interproton distance restraints for the DNA were classified into five ranges, ° 1.8­2.5, 1.8­3.0, 1.8­3.5, 2.3­5.0, and 2.3­6.0 A. Experimental restraints are listed in Table S1. Distances involving nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons and aromatic ring protons in the protein were represented as a ( r 6) 1/6 sum (Omichinski et al., 1997). Watson-Crick base pairing was maintained in the DNA by the following hydrogen bond restraints: for GC base pairs, rG(N1) C(N3) 2.95 ° ° ° 0.2 A, rG(N2) C(O2) 2.86 0.2 A, and rG(O6) C(N4) 2.91 0.2 A; for AT ° ° 0.2 A, and rA(N6) T(O4) 2.86 0.2 A base pairs, rA(N1)-T(N3 ) 2.82 (Wojciak et al., 1999). Loose torsion angle restraints for the DNA were used to alleviate problems associated with mirror images, covering both A- and B-form DNA conformers ( 65 50 , 180 50 , 60 50 , 180 50 and 85 50 ) (Omichinski et al., 1997; Wojciak et al., 1999). In addition, angles for all sugar rings were estimated to be 145 50 , based on (H1 , H2 ) or (H3 , H4 ) cross peak patterns in a DQF-COSY spectrum. These hydrogen bond and torsion angle restraints for DNA are justified, because the pattern of NOEs for the DNA is typical of B-DNA. Weak planarity restraints for base pairs were included during the ° simulated-annealing protocol (a force constant of 10 kcal mol 1A 2). The XPLOR target function also included a quadratic harmonic potential term for covalent geometry and a quartic harmonic potential term for van der Waals repulsion. In the final steps of the structure determination, hydrogen bond restraints within the protein were included for 13 slowly exchanging protein backbone amides ob° ° tained at 303 K (pH 6.5) (2.8­3.4 A [N-O], 1.8­2.4 A [H-O]). No proteinDNA interfacial hydrogen bonds were assumed during the calculation of the complex. The procedure for calculating the complex structure was essentially as described by Omichinski et al. (1997). First, the structure of the protein was calculated by simulated annealing using only restraints within the protein. Second, the structure of the complex was calculated by simulated annealing using all the experimental restraints, starting from B-form DNA and the calculated structure of the protein, and using a variety of protein-DNA orientations with ° a separation of about 50 A. In total, 200 structures of the complex were calculated. Of these, 81 structures exhibited neither distance ° violations greater than 0.3 A nor dihedral violations greater than 5 degrees. These structures were further refined by a simulated annealing procedure. Finally, the 20 structures with the lowest energy were selected and analyzed with MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996), and PROCHECK-NMR software (Laskowski et al., 1996). The statistics of these structures are listed in Table S1. All figures of molecular structures were drawn with MOLMOL or GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). The protein-DNA hydrogen bonds illustrated in Figure 4B are observed in most members of the NMR ensemble, except for the hydrogen bond from the guanidinium of Arg-44 to either N7 or O6 of G19, or to both of them. This Arg-44-G19 hydrogen bond was assumed on the basis of the following observations. First, single substitution of Arg-44 to either alanine or lysine abolished DNA binding, indicating that Arg-44 is important for DNA binding (Figure 4C). Second, in members of the NMR ensemble, only N7 or O6 of G19 and/or O6 of G20 can accept hydrogen bond from the N atom of Arg-44; no other group in the DNA was found to accept the bond.

Cell 496

Of these two Arg-44-base contacts, the significance, or existence, of the Arg-44-G20 hydrogen bond can be excluded because MBD of MBD1 can bind efficiently to DNA of the sequence 5 -GATCGAm5 CGACGTAC-3 (data not shown). This observation indicates that for specific binding, the base following the m5CG sequence (positions 8 and 20 in Figure 1B) can also be adenine or thymine. Taken together, these observations indicate that the Arg-44-G19 hydrogen bond found in the NMR ensemble is significant in DNA recognition. However, no additional restraints besides the NOE-derived ones were applied to the side chain of Arg-44 or Arg-22 during the structure calculation. The interfacial NOE restraints involving these residues included: for Arg-44, H -mC18(methyl), H -C17(H2 ), -mC18(H2 and methyl), -[C17(H6) or mC18(H6)], H -mC18(H2 and methyl), -[C17(H6) or mC18(H6)], H -mC18(H6 and methyl), H -mC18(methyl); for Arg-22, H -C5(H4 ), -mC6(H2 ), H -mC6(H6 and methyl), H mC6(H2 ,H2 ,H3 , H6 and methyl), -G7(H8), H -mC6(H6 and methyl), -G7(H8), HN-[mC6(H3 ) or C5(H3 )]. Mutational Analyses Vector constructs containing mutated MBDs were prepared, and the GST-MBD fusion proteins were purified, as described previously (Ohki et al., 1999). For each mutant except S45A, we checked that the overall native fold had not been disrupted by 1H-15N HSQC spectra, as described previously (Ohki et al., 1999). We could not obtain enough of the S45A MBD for HSQC measurements; however, a 1H NMR spectrum of S45A showed no evidence of disruption of the native fold (Ohki et al., 1999). DNA binding reactions were carried out in 10 l of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol. The mixtures contained 1.7 g of each purified protein and 74 ng of the methylated or unmethylated 12-mer oligonucleotide duplex. Reactions were carried out for 30 min at room temperature. The binding reaction mixtures were loaded on a 10% acrylamide gel and run in TBE; the gels were stained with SYBR green I (Molecular Probes). Of those shown in Figure 4C, we have previously reported DNA binding activities of the following mutants: R22A, R30A, D32A, Y34A, R44A, S45A, and Y52A (Ohki et al., 1999).
