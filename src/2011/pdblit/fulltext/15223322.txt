Introduction The treatment of cancer with vaccines has been a dream of physicians since the first vaccines against infectious diseases were developed. Advances in the development of vaccines against many infectious diseases, such as poliomyelitis, measles and rubella, have been based on the demonstration that immunity against the infecting agent (or related agents) resulting from natural infection is protective against reinfection. Only recently has the remarkable progress in molecular biology and our understanding of antigen processing and presentation provided a of vaccines that may someday basis for the production induce immunity against infectious diseases that do not naturally induce protective immunity. With regard to cancer, specific and protective immune responses against a variety of experimental tumors in laboratory animals have been induced by tumor vaccines [ 1,2], but comparable responses in man have been more difficult to document. Patients with unexpectedly favorable courses after spontaneous regression or surgical resection of metastatic cancer occasionally have tumor-specific antibodies [ 21 or qtotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [3,4], but such antibodies or T cells are also sometimes seen in patients with rapidly progressive cancers [ 23 1. As with infectious diseases that do not induce natural immunity, the problem appears to be a combination of the poor immunogenic@ of relevant antigens, antigenic heterogeneity, which permits cells expressing little or no antigen to escape immune attack, and the uncertainty over which arm of the immune system is most important for conferring protection. Excepting the few tumor antigens associated with transformation and encoded by viruses, most well defined tumor antigens are autoantigens with a restricted distribu-

tion on normal tissues (differentiation antigens) or normal antigens with mutations. Since partial or complete tolerance to these predominantly self antigens is expected, our focus turns to approaches for augmenting immunogenicity. They include the following: (a) covalent attachment (conjugation 1 to immunogenic carrier proteins for the induction of T helper (Th) cell active ity and an efficient antibody response; (b) expression of proteins or peptides in viral or mycobacterial vectors for induction of CTLS as well as Th cells and antibodies; and (c) the use of potent immunological adjuvants GqXble of augmenting all arms of the immune system. These three approaches, which are discussed further below, are greatly facilitated by the availability of carbohydrate and peptide tumor antigens for vaccine construction. There are several additional apprc' aches to tumor vaccine construction which will not be discussed in this review. These include the following: whole cell or cell-fraction vaccines (some of which may eventually fall under the scope of this review when the relevant antigens are bet, ter characterized) [ 1,5] ; anti-idiotypic vaccines containing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with variable regions resembling epitopes on cancer cells [6,7] ; and autologous or ~~~~matched cells modified to contain genes for the expression of cytokines [8,9] or tumor antigens. Some of these approaches will be discussed in other reviews in this issue.

of greatest interest to the tumor immunologist are the differentiation antigens, which although never tumor specific, may have a distribution restricted to a subset of normal tissues of the same embryological origin. Many of these carbohydrate antigens have been described (reviewed in [lo] ), but only a few are known to be immunogenic in man. These can be divided into two categories, namely gangliosides and blood group related antigens.

Gangliosides

Gdngliosides are neuraminic acid containing glycosphingolipids that are anchored into the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane by their lipophilic ceramide moiety. They came to the attention of tumor immunologists ini~ tially because they are abundantly expressed on a number of tumors of neuroectodermal origin, and natural antibodies against GM2 and GD2 gangliosides were iden~ tilied in sera from some normal donors and melanoma patients (reviewed in Ill]). Immunization with whole melanoma cell vaccines was shown to result in GM2 and GD2 antibodies in a subset of patients [ 11,121. Based on this experience my collaborators, Oettgen and Old, and I focused on GM2 ganglioside in our initial studies with purified antigen vaccines in melanoma patients. In a series of experiments in the mouse, we showed that the immunogenicity of GM2 and other gangliosides is increased by pretreatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide (decreasing suppressor-cell activity) and the use of vehicle-adjuvants such as various bacteria or liposomes (reviewed in [5]). Bacillus CalmetteG&rin (BCG) wds found to be a particularly effective carrier in man [ 111 and so was used in a randomized trial comparing cyclophosphamide plus BCG with cyclophosphamide plus the GM2/BCG vaccine. Produc tion of GM2 antibodies after immunization was associated with a significantly longer disease-free interval and survival. Comparing the control (RCG) and experimental (GM2/BCG) arms of this study, with a minimal follow-up of 40 months, a 17% improvement in disease-free interval and a 9% improvement in survival was seen in patients receiving GM2/BCG vaccines. Neither improvement was statistically significant (p = 0.06 and 0.29, respectively). IgM antibodies that had a relatively short duration were seen in 86% of immunized patients while 1gG antibodies were detected in only lo%, consistent with GM2 acting as a T-cell independent antigen. To improve upon these results we are currently exploring two approaches: firstly, the use of conjugate vaccines with gangliosides covalently attached to immunogenic carrier proteins plus the use of additional potent immunological adjuvants, such as those described below; and secondly, the construction of polyvalent vaccines containing four gangliosides known to be immunogenic in man and to be expressed minimally on normal tissues: GM2, GD2, GT3 and 9-O-ace@ GD3

antigens of epithelial cancers. Springer [ 141 first called attention to Thornsen-Friedenreich (T) antigen (GalplSGalNAca-0-Ser) expression on breast cancer specimens and the anti-T antibodies in most normal sera. Both T and sialylated Tn (sTn) (Neu5Acc12-6GalNAcaOSer) antigens are expressed in glycoproteins or mucins and have been successfully used for imaging various types of epithelial cancers [ 15,161. With regard to tumor vaccines containing T and sTn antigens, epithelial cancer cells growing in tissue culture do not generally express these antigens or express them minimally, so alternative sources of these antigens are required for vaccine construction. We have immunized 20 patients with a vaccine containing partially desialylated ovine submaxillary mucin (OSM) expressing Tn and sTn [17]. While none of the six patients receiving OSM alone produced detectable antibodies, nine of 14 patients receiving OSM plus the irnmunological adjuvants BCG or Detox produced a high titer of anti-sTn IgM antibodies. Patients only occasionally produced IgG antibodies against sTn and these were of low titer. Conjugate vaccines with T or sTn covalently attached to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and other carriers are currently under investigation in a number of laboratories. Vaccines containing synthetic T antigen covalently attached to KLH have resulted in IgM and IgG antibodies and delayed type hypersensitivity reations against T antigen in the mouse as well as the recovery of mice with establised tumors [ 18,191. Recently, production IgM and IgG antibodies against T antigen in man on administration of these vaccines has also been described [ 201. MacLean' and our groups (unpublished s data) have induced IgM and IgG antibodies against sTn in cancer patients after sTn-KIH vaccinations.

The carbohydrate tumor antigens described above are well characterized, expressed predominantly at the cell surface, known to be immunogenic and are available for study in purified or synthetic form, advantages that do not all apply to any of the protein antigens identified on human tumor cells. There are, however, several protein or glycoprotein antigens identified by sera from patients with melanoma. Gp75 is a member of the tyrosinase-related family of proteins and is an integral membrane protein of melanosomes [ 21 ?? was originally identified on *I It melanoma cells by sera from a patient with melanoma. Its restricted distribution on normal cells and its extensive presence around melanoma cells has permitted it to be used eflictively for localization studies with the antigp75 mAb TA99 in the mouse [22]. Immunization studies with gp75 protein are currently in progress in the preclinical setting. Two glycoprotein antigens that have been particularly well studied are ~97 (melanoferrin) [23] and the 58 kD melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan antigen [ 241. Both are abundantly expressed on melanoma cells and are expressed widely but in lesser amounts on normal cells. Neither has been shown

to be immunogenic in man either naturally or after immunization with whole cell vaccines. Antibodies against the high molecular weight melanoma chondroitin sulfate antigen have been reported in patients immunized vaccinia with anti-idiotype vaccines [7]. A recombinant virus expressing p97 has been shown to augment irnmunity against p97 and melanoma cells in rodents and two monkeys (reviewed in [ 25]), and a clinical trial with this recombinant vaccine is in progress. Other serologitally defined immunogenic melanoma antigens have been described. They include the FD antigen, which is a mutated version of p97 (described above) recognized in zitro by serum from patient FD exclusively on his autologous melanoma cell line [ 261, and melanoma tumor associated antigen (MTAA) and urinary tumor associated antigen (UTAA), two well defined antigens, which have not yet been sequenced, identified by sera from many melanoma patients in extracts prepared from melanoma culture medium or melanoma patient urine (respectively). Antibody titers against both MTAA and LJTAA have been increased by immunization with whole melanoma cell vaccines [27], Two additional antigens are known to be immunogenic in man as a consequence of identification by CT& The first of these, MZ2-E, is a protein antigen which was identified by Boon and coworkers [28**] and is reviewed in this issue by van der Bruggen and Van den Eynde (pp 60~12). The second is the polymorphic epithelial mucin (PEM) antigen expressed by adenocarcinomas of breast and pancreas origin. The protein core of this mucin (Mucl) contains multiple tandem repeats of a 20 amino acid sequence and is identical to the one expressed on the corresponding normal tissues [ 29]. It is not, however, recognized on normal cells by mAbs or CTLs, presumably as a consequence of more efficient glycosylation obscuring the protein core in normal tissues. CTL recognition occurs in a MHC-unrestricted fashion, a finding attributed to the highly repetitive nature of the antigenic epitope [ 30**]. A recombinant vaccinia virus expressing this epithelial tumor antigen has successfully been used to immunize rats against challenge with a tumor expressing the PEM antigen [31]. PEM peptide and vaccinia vector vaccines are being explored in the preclinical setting at a number of institutions.

issue

A variety of proto-oncogene products (i.e. HER2-neu, ras, c-myc, c-abl and epidermal growth factor receptor) and tumor suppressor gene products (i.e. ~53 and RB) have been identified and the list of both is rapidly expanding. Most are nuclear antigens, which are not normal cell surface constituents. Their expression at the cell surface as processed peptides bound to MHC antigens is assumed but not yet documented. Others such as the epidermal growth fact!Jr receptor and HER2neu are cell surface components and thus are susceptible to recognition by antibodies as well as CT& P53 and HERZ neu are reviewed briefly here to indicate the progress made and the obstacles remaining to the use of these types of antigens for vaccine construction. Mutations in the ~5-3 tumor suppressor gene resulting in a prolonged half-life and the marked hyperexpression of the mutant ~5-3 gene product have been identified in the majority of human cancers (reviewed in [ 33**]). The wild type p5.? gene product cannot generally be detected in any normal tissues. Consequently, mutated p53 and possibly wild type p53 antigens are good candidates for vaccine construction. It remains to be determined whether these nuclear antigens can be presented in the context of HIA class I or II antigens at the tumor cell surface and be reconcogene ognized by CTIs or Th cells. The HERA-mu encodes a 185kD transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in multiple human malignancies and is associated with progression of breast and ovarian neoplasms (reviewed in [34]). Immunization of mice with the human HER2mu gene product has induced transplantation immunity against syngeneic tumors transfected with the human HER2 neu gene [35], but immunization with mouse HER2 neu gene has not rem sulted in protection against tumors expressing syngeneic (mouse) HERZneu antigen. This may be a consequence of immunological tolerance due to expression of this gene product on a number of tissues in the fetus and in some normal cells in the adult.

Viral transforming gene products and proto-oncogene products are two classes of tumor antigens that offer significant promise for vaccine construction although neither are known to be recognized on human tumor cells by human antibodies or T cells. The Epstein-Barr virus induced latent membrane protein, which has been reported to be expressed on 65% of nasopharyngeal carcinomas and 50% of Hodgkin' s lymphomas, and the Papilloma virus E6 and E7 transforming gene products expressed on 85% of cervical cancers are of special interest for vaccine construction. Viral transforming gene

This approach derives from Landsteiner' classic experis ments with hapten conjugation and has been used successfully to augment the immunogenic@ of a variety of peptide and carbohydrate antigens. It is based on the concept of split tolerance. Studies of immunological t&erance and ways to overcome it have shown' in multiple experimental systems that T-cell unresponsiveness is more rapidly induced and more easily maintained than B-cell unresponsiveness. Levels of circulating antigens suitable fbr maintaining T-cell tolerance frequently fail to maintain B-cell tolerance. Consequently, if T-cell help is provided by covalent attachment to immunogenic proteins or use of the corresponding xenogeneic antigens (i.e. rat thyroglobulin in mice), antibodies can be pro-

duced to tolerated T-cell dependent antigens. A variety of experimental autoimmune diseases have been induced by the use of this approach (reviewed in [ 5,361). Immunization of infants with diphtheria toxoid conjugated to Haemophilus influenzae type B capsular polysaccharide, but not the B polysaccharide alone, results in IgG antibody production and protection from H. inJhenzae meningitis [ 371.We and others have used this approach for the induction of IgM and IgG antibodies against GD3 ganglioside and T and sTn antigens, three antigens which normally result in only IgM antibodies [38-40]. B-cell activation by approaches such as these results in improved antigen-presenting capacity for the B cells and has been reported to facilitate T-cell activation against autoantigens 141,421.

QS21 which is a purified Quil A saponin fraction [ 50**]. Of these adjuvants, QS21 is unique in that it is able to induce CTL activity against peptide antigens in addition to the usual Th-cell activity and antibody responses [ 50**]. Based on studies comparing the antibody titers and delayed type hypersensitivity responses to a variety of carbohydrate and protein antigens [ 39,511, we have selected SAI-m and QS21 as particularly potent adjuvants suitable for study in man. We are currently conducting Phase I clinical trials with QS21 and SAFm.

Conclusion It is possible, with only slight trepidation, to predict the course tumor vaccinology will take over the next few years. Functional and antigenic heterogeneity are inherent features of malignancy and genetically based heterogeneity of responsiveness to individual antigenic epitopes is an inherent feature of the host immune response. Consequently, immunization against single tumor antigens is not likely to be as effective as polyvalent tumor vaccines, and so the quest for additional immunogenic carbohydrate and protein tumor antigens must continue. This quest will benefit from a variety of approaches for identifying tumor antigens such as those described by van der Bruggen and Van den Eynde (pp GOs-blZ) and Rettig (pp 63&640) in this issue. It will also benefit from efforts to understand how tumor antigens are normally processed and presented to the immune system, as well as how tumor cells may sabotage this presentation, issues described by Browning and Bodmer (pp 613418). Most tumor antigens will be autoantigens, or mutated autoantigens, which are poorly immunogenic. Consequently approaches such as those described above for augmenting their immunogenicity will be pivotal. Additional approaches toward this end, such as attachment of peptides to heat shock proteins which may circumvent or facilitate presentation by MHC molecules (reviewed in [52**] >, will undoubtedly result from continuing advances in our understanding of antigen processing, presentation and recognition. Immunogenicity will be further augmented by new generations of potent immunological adjuvants which are able to augment all arms of the immune system (presumably by local cytokine induction in the proper sequence and magnitude) or the direct use of cytokines as described by Pardoll in this issue (pp 619423). The application of these various immunization approaches in a stepwise manner, guided initially by serological or cell-mediated immune responses induced in immunized patients and subsequently by the results of controlled randomized clinical studies, will undoubtedly be productive. It will identif): some antigens that induce protective responses and some that do not induce protective responses or induce detrimental responses as has occurred with vaccines against some infectious diseases [53]. In the long run, however, this stepwise approach will teach much about interactions between the immune system and cancer, and will add active specific immuno therapy with tumor vaccines to the list of effective moddl~ ities for the treatment of cancer.

and mycobacterial T cells

Vaccination with recombinant viruses or mycobacteria expressing the relevant antigens is another approach being used for immunization against infectious diseases and cancer. Following infection by the vector the intracellular production of antigen results in its expression in the context of class I as well as class II MHC antigens and induction of CTLs as well as Th cells. This approach is being used with a number of viruses (reviewed in [43]) but especially vaccinia virus for immunization against the melanoma glycoprotein ~97 (melanoferrin) [ 441, the epithelial tumor mucin antigen [32-l and carcinoembryonic antigen [ 451. Recombinant BCG may also be particularly suitable for this approach for a number of reasons: BCG has been safely used to immunize millions of people; it is a strong immunopotentiating agent; it persists in uivo for a long period of time; it induces immune responses for many years; and recently, recombinant BCG has successfully induced long-lived Th-cell and CTL responses against transfected antigen in mice [46],

Immunological

adjuvants

The term immunological adjuvant refers to an agent that increases the specific immune response to antigens. The relative importance of depot effect (i.e. the sequestration of antigen for slow release and for phagocrytosis by macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells), macrophage activation, and T-cell and B-cell activation in augmenting immune responses following adjuvant use remains an open question and is probably dependent on the antigen used. Primarily because of the need for adjuvants to augment the immunogenic@ of recombinant peptide and purified carbohydrate vaccines against infectious diseases, a number of potent new adjuvants have been prepared and are in various phases of preclinical and clinical testing. These include the following: pleuronic triblock copolymers such as L121 [47], which are known to activate macrophages and facilitate attachment of antigen to lipid-aqueous interfaces; SAI-m, which contains a muramyl dipeptide analog, L121 and squalene [48]; Detox which contains a monophosphoryl lipid A analog and mycobacterial cell wall skeletons [49]: and
