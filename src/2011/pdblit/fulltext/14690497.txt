COPI-coated vesicles mediate retrograde transport from the Golgi back to the ER and intra-Golgi transport. The cytosolic precursor of the COPI coat, the heptameric coatomer complex, can be thought of as composed of two subcomplexes. The first consists of the b-, g -, d- and z-COP subunits which are distantly homologous to AP clathrin adaptor subunits. The second consists of the a-, b0 - and e-COP subunits. Here, we present the structure of the appendage domain of g -COP and show that it has a similar overall fold as the a-appendage of AP2. Again, like the a-appendage the g -COP appendage possesses a single protein/protein interaction site on its platform subdomain. We show that in yeast this site binds to the ARFGAP Glo3p, and in mammalian g -COP this site binds to a Glo3p orthologue, ARFGAP2. On the basis of mutations in the yeast homologue of g -COP, Sec21p, a second binding site is proposed to exist on the g -COP appendage that interacts with the a,b0 ,e COPI subcomplex.

in most organelles. For example, the ER retains its resident proteins by a sorting mechanism that ensures that ERderived COPII vesicles are enriched for proteins destined for transport elsewhere and depleted for ER-resident proteins (6). Any ER-resident proteins that aberrantly enter COPII vesicles along with SNAREs that allow COPII vesicle fusion and are consequently delivered to the VTCs and/or cis-Golgi are transported back to the ER by the COPI retrieval machinery (5,7). The COPI coat was first identified in a mammalian cell-free assay that reconstitutes intra-Golgi transport (4,5,8). The abundant coat present on vesicles isolated using this assay is composed of the small GTPase ARF1 and the COPI complex (also termed coatomer), a cytosolic 700-kDa protein complex comprising seven stoichiometric subunits a-, b-, b0 -, g-, d-, e- and z-COP. Each of the subunits is well conserved from mammals to yeast, and with the exception of e-COP, which appears to play a structure-stabilizing role (9), the genes for all the COPI subunits are essential for yeast cell viability (10). COPI is found mainly on the cis-side of the Golgi and on anterograde VTCs, where it is believed to sort cargo ready for return to the ER through its binding to ER retrieval signals. The signals characterized to date include KKxx, which has been shown variously to bind to the WD40 domain of a-COP (11­13) and to g-COP (14,15), a di-aromatic motif that may bind to d-COP (16) and a KxKxx motif whose binding site on coatomer has so far not been characterized. Coatomer and GTP-bound ARF1 constitute the minimal machinery required to deform a lipid bilayer into vesicles or buds, since they are the only proteins necessary to produce COPI-coated vesicles from Golgi-enriched membranes or liposomes of a defined composition (8,17,18). Uncoating of COPI vesicles is initiated when ARF1 hydrolyses its bound GTP, which releases ARF1 and coatomer back into the cytosolic pool, and this ultimately allows fusion of the vesicles with its target membrane to occur (5). The rate of the GTP hydrolysis reaction on ARF1 is greatly enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins, ARFGAPs. In yeast, two ARFGAP proteins, Gcs1p and Glo3p, provide an essential, overlapping function in COPImediated retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport, whereas knocking out either gene individually results in only a mild phenotype (19,20). The mammalian Gcs1p orthologue has been characterized and is named ARFGAP1 (21). Much evidence exists to suggest that ARFGAPs, apart from being involved in vesicle uncoating, play a role in cargo selection into COPI-coated vesicles (22,23), reviewed in (24). The exchange of GDP for GTP that `reprimes' the cycle and drives ARF1 onto the membrane is catalyzed 79

The secretory pathway consists of a series of membranebound compartments [endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vesicular-tubular clusters (VTC), the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane] that are distinct from each other in terms of molecular composition and function. The establishment and maintenance of the identity of every organelle depends on the correct localization and retention of its resident proteins (1,2). There are two main mechanisms by which this may be achieved. One mechanism is to prevent the entry of resident proteins into transport vesicles that form from a given organelle. This may be achieved through the physical interaction of these proteins with other resident components of the organelle, such as large, multiply tethered protein complexes or lipids with a distinct organelle localization (3). A second mechanism is the selective retrieval of resident proteins after they have incorrectly left an organelle (4,5). Current evidence suggests that both mechanisms act simultaneously

by GTP exchange factors (GEFs). As a result, the localization of the GEF may directly define the membrane onto which the COPI coat via its interaction with membrane-associated GTP-bound ARF1 (25,26). Much structural work has been carried out on the AP clathrin adaptor complexes and the related monomeric GGA clathrin adaptors. Sequence comparisons have indicated low but significant homology between the a, b, m and s subunits of AP adaptor complexes and the g,b,d,z subcomplex of COPI (27); for review, see (10,28). Inspection and secondary structure prediction indicate that, as with the large adaptin AP subunits, g-COP consists of a large stacked helical region at the N-terminus joined to an appendage domain by a low-complexity linker with little or no secondary structure. It was decided that confirmation of the structural similarity between COPI and APs would be finally established if their appendage domains possessed similar folds despite having sequence similarity on the very edge of detection, e.g. 15 residues out of 266 for the putative appendage of g-COP compared with the a-adaptin appendage. It was also hoped that the structure of a part of COPI, which by analogy with APs would be predicted to have a functional rather than structural role, would provide a starting point for functional investigations into the exact role of COPI in vesicle formation. Most specifically, since the appendages of APs have been shown to bind to/recruit other proteins that play important roles in CCV formation (29­31), it was hoped that similar `accessory proteins' would be discovered that bind to the g-COP appendage and may be involved in COPI vesicle formation. In this work, we present the structure of the g-COP appendage. It clearly has a similar overall structure as the a and b2 appendage of AP2, confirming the evolutionary relationship proposed to exist between COPI and the APs. Only one binding partner outside coatomer itself was detected for the human g-COP appendage, namely the novel ARF GAP protein, ARFGAP2, which is a mammalian orthologue of Glo3p in yeast (G. Frigerio et al., manuscript in preparation). We further show that the yeast ARFGAP Glo3p binds to the yeast g-COP (Sec21p) appendage domain, thus localizing one of the two binding sites for Glo3p previously demonstrated on yeast coatomer (13). In common with the a-appendage accessory binding site, the binding site for ARFGAP2 is a single patch of high hydrophobic potential on the surface of the C-terminal or platform subdomain. Mutation of this site prevents the binding of ARFGAP2 to the g-COP appendage both in vitro and in vivo. However, loss of this binding function resulting from a point mutation (F836S) in the binding platform on yeast g-COP had no effect on trafficking from the Golgi in yeast, as assayed by Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) sorting. The point mutant showed no transport defect for CPY, whereas deletion of the entire autonomously folding appendage domain resulted in a CPY transport defect. These data suggest that a second ligand important for COPI function, other than GLO3p, must bind in a different way to the g-COP appendage, either at the 80

same or a different site. The implications for the formation and disassembly of COPI-coated vesicles are discussed in the light of these findings.

Results
Structure of the g -COP appendage domain We have determined the structure of the g-COP appendage domain (residues 608­874 of human g-COP) by X-ray crystallography. Crystals of the g-COP appendage domain ° diffract to 1.9 A resolution and the structure was determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction from a single selenomethionine derivative crystal (Table 1). Despite the lack of significant sequence homology, the g-COP appendage has a similar bilobal (2 subdomain) structure to the appendages of the a- and b2-subunits from the AP2 adaptor protein complex. The N-terminal subdomain is an 8-stranded b-sandwich, reminiscent of an immunoglobulin fold, which unlike other appendage domains, possesses a short a-helix at the extreme N-terminal end. The C-terminal or platform subdomain is joined to the N-terminal subdomain by a short linker, and consists of a four-stranded b-sheet flanked by 3 a-helices (Figure 1). Structural and functional studies have shown that the a- and b2-subunits of AP2 bind proteins that play accessory/regulatory roles in vesicle formation via their C-terminal appendage domains. These interactions were proposed to involve binding of DPF/W peptide motifs from the accessory proteins in a hydrophobic pocket centered around a conserved tryptophan within the platform subdomains of the appendages (29,30,32). This has now been confirmed by the determination of the structure of the a-appendage complexed with a number of DPF/W peptides (33). By analogy with these adaptor appendage domains, we believe that the platform will act as a site for protein recruitment. This proposal is supported by the observation that one of the few identical residues conserved between the a, b2 adaptin and g-COP appendage domains is the tryptophan around which the DPF/W binding pocket in the a appendage domain is built (equivalent to W776 in human g-COP). Moreover, it can be seen that this tryptophan plays a role in forming a similar pocket of high hydrophobic potential in g-COP as in the a and b2-appendage domains. The N-terminal subdomain (b-sandwich) of the a and b2appendage domains is thought to act as a structural scaffold that orientates the platform domain, although there is a suggestion that it may also contain a site for protein/ protein interactions (33). The g-appendage domains of AP1 and the GGAs consist of just a b-sandwich domain, which contains the binding site for accessory proteins (31,34). Inspection of the g-COP appendage structure, indicates that its b-sandwich domain contains a patch of high hydrophobic potential that could form a protein-binding pocket (Figure 2).

(D) Sequence alignment between the g-COP appendage domain and the a- and b2-appendage domains of AP1, conserved residues are indicated by yellow boxes. Overall, the sequence homology is poor; however, the tryptophan at the center of a hydrophobic binding pocket in the a- and b2-appendages (29,30) is conserved between all three (Trp 776 on this alignment).

Identification of binding partners Whereas many binding partners are known for the a appendage of AP2 and the g appendage of AP1, surprisingly little is known about proteins that bind to COPI. It has previously been demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays that a member of the ARFGAP family involved in retrograde traffic in yeast, Glo3p, can interact with Sec21p, Traffic 2004; 5: 79­88

the yeast orthologue of the g-subunit of COPI, as well as with yeast b0 -COP, and also avidly binds to coatomer in vitro (13). To investigate whether this interaction is conserved between yeast and mammals and is mediated by the g-COP appendage, more specifically the hydrophobic pocket identified in the structure, the wild type and W776S mutant forms of the g-COP appendage were produced as 81

N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The tryptophan residue at the center of the pocket (W776) was mutated to a serine as in both the a and b2-appendages this mutation has been shown to prevent binding through this site without unfolding the protein. These were then used in pull-down experiments from rat liver cytosol (Figure 3). Products of the GST pull-down experiments were analyzed by Western blotting using affinity purified antibodies against the two isoforms of yeast Glo3p, mammalian ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3, which have been identified in mammals (G. Frigerio et al., manuscript in preparation). Both isoforms were shown to be present in rat liver cytosol. The g-COP appendage bound strongly to the ARFGAP2 isoform but only weakly to the ARFGAP3 isoform. Neither isoform bound to the fully folded W776S mutant form of the g-COP appendage, indicating that the interaction occurs in the hydrophobic pocket centered around Trp776, as predicted. 82

We next investigated by immunofluorescence whether this interaction occurs in vivo by immunofluorescence. The g-COP appendage domain, and the W776S point mutant were cloned into a eukaryotic overexpression vector under the control of the Cyto Megalovirus Virus promoter and these constructs were transfected into NRK cells. After expression of the native g-COP appendage, we observed a strong effect on the localization of ARFGAP2, with the staining becoming cytosolic as opposed to punctate and peri-nuclear. This is consistent with membranelocalized ARFGAP2 being sequestered into the cytosol by its interaction with free cytosolic overexpressed g-COP appendage. In line with the binding experiments described above, the labeling of ARFGAP3 remained normal (Figures 3 and 4). No effect on the labeling of either ARFGAP2 or ARFGAP3 was observed in cells transfected with the mutant g-COP (W776S) appendage domain. These data strongly suggest that ARFGAP2 is a bona fide in vivo Traffic 2004; 5: 79­88

established that the direct interaction between the g-COP appendage domain and Glo3p was conserved. Indeed, we found that a GST-tagged Sec21p appendage but not GST protein alone bound to yeast Glo3p with significant specificity (Figure 3B). This interaction was abolished if Phe836, the bulky hydrophobic residue in the proposed binding pocket (analogous to Trp776 in g-COP) was mutated to serine (Figure 3B). Analysis of this point mutant in yeast cells, however, revealed no effect on the maturation of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a common marker for membrane transport in yeast. Truncation of the entire Sec21p appendage domain (cells expressing only residues 1­647 of Sec21p) however, led to temperature-sensitive growth and a CPY defect (Figure 3C). In pulse-chase experiments we found only 42% of newly synthesized CPY in the vacuole after a 300 chase vs. 88.5% in wildtype cells and 89% in F836S mutant cells (Figure 3C). Clearly, truncation of the Sec21p ear domain led to a much more severe phenotype than a point mutant inactivating the Glo3p binding pocket of Sec21p. Together, these data suggested the existence of another binding partner for the appendage of g-COP or its yeast homologue Sec21p, whose binding was not abolished by mutation of the platform subdomain hydrophobic pocket. One potential binding partner would be the a,b0 ,e subcomplex of coatomer. To investigate this possibility, the binding of GST-g-COP appendage to purified intact mammalian coatomer and to purified coatomer that had been dissociated with the lysine e-amino-group blocking agent DMMA was tested. The data in Figure 5 show that both the wild-type and W776S mutant form of the g-COP appendage bound to the a,b0 ,e subcomplex of coatomer, as indicated by the presence of both a-COP and b0 -COP subunits.

Figure 3: Interaction of the g -COP appendage domain with ARFGAP2. (A) GST-g-COP appendage domain and the W776S point mutant were tested for binding to ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 in pull-down experiments from rat liver cytosol. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting. GST, GST-amphiphysin SH3 domain, and GST-a-appendage were included as negative controls. This shows clearly that ARFGAP2 binds to the g-COP appendage domain to a much greater extent than ARFGAP3. In the ARFGAP3 pull-downs, ARFGAP3 is indicated by an asterisk (*). (B) GST-Sec21 appendage domain and the F836S point mutant were tested for binding to Glo3p in pull-down experiments from wild-type, pep4D yeast cells (9). Proteins were detected by immunoblotting. GST and GST-amphiphysin SH3 domain were included as negative controls. This shows clearly that yeast Glo3p binds to the yeast Sec 21p appendage domain. (C) Trafficking defects of sec21 mutants were assessed by in vivo pulse-chase labeling experiments assaying the transport of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY). A defect in the ER-to-Golgi transport of CPY was observed in sec21 truncation mutant cells, whilst the sec21 point mutant cells showed wild-type CPY sorting.

Discussion
The bilobal structure of the Sec21p appendage domain demonstrates the close relationship between the AP complexes and the b,g,d,z subcomplex of COPI [(36), and this study]. Our results leave COPII as the only coat which bears no evolutionary relationship to the others ­ AP complexes, GGAs and COPI. By analogy with the situation seen in the a and b2 appendages of AP2, the existence of a hydrophobic protein-binding site on the C-terminal platform domain of the g-COP appendage was postulated. This site was similar in chemical properties to those found in the AP2 appendages, being a pocket of high hydrophobic potential surrounded by polar residues. However, in order to test this hypothesis a ligand for this site needed to be identified. In the case of AP complexes, the proteins that bind to the appendages play `accessory' or `regulatory' roles in clathrin-coated vesicle formation and along with clathrin form a `meshwork' of proteins that coat the membrane of a coated pit. `Pull-down' experiments from a 83

binding partner of the g-COP appendage domain. Cells transfected with either the native or the point mutant gCOP appendage domain, were also labeled for the Golgi marker TGN38. Labeling remained normal in both cases, indicating that overexpression of the proteins did not have any adverse effects on overall Golgi structure. Role of the g -COP appendage domain in yeast To further understand the function of the g-COP appendage in COPI-mediated membrane traffic, we made use of the genetic tractability of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae whose g-COP orthologue is Sec21p (35). First, we Traffic 2004; 5: 79­88

variety of tissue sources with GST-g-COP appendage revealed no bands suitable for identification by mass spectrometry. Yeast 2-hybrid studies, however, had previously shown that the yeast homologue of g-COP Sec21p, interacts with Glo3p, one of the two ARF GTPase-activating proteins involved in retrograde Golgi-to-ER traffic in yeast 84

(13). In this work, we show that the g-COP appendage of yeast and man, respectively, binds Glo3p and a human Glo3p orthologue, ARFGAP2 (G. Frigerio et al, manuscript in preparation), in vitro and in vivo. Binding of ARFGAP2 occurs at the hydrophobic site predicted to be involved in making protein/protein interactions by analysis of the Traffic 2004; 5: 79­88

g -COP Appendage Domain Structure

Figure 5: Interaction of g -COP appendage with coatomer subunits. GST-g-COP appendage and the GST-g-COP appendage W776S point mutant were tested for binding to the a,b0 ,e subcomplex of coatomer in pull-down experiments. The heptameric coatomer complex was used either in its native form (bottom panel) or following dissociation into its two subcomplexes by treatment with DMMA (top two panels). Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against the a and b0 subunits. GST and GST-amphiphysin SH3 were included as negative controls. Binding of GST-g-COP appendage and of the W776S mutant to the a,b0 ,e subcomplex was only detected when the coatomer was first dissociated into its constituent subcomplexes.

(13). These interactions are most likely involved in the structural stability of the coatomer complex (13). Failure to detect such an interaction in `pull-down' experiments from cytosol would likely be due therefore to the inability of free Sec21p/g-COP appendage to compete effectively with Sec21p/g-COP appendages that are part of the heptameric coatomer complex, which is held tightly together by multiple interactions between the various subunits (13,37). However, as data in Figure 5 indicate, after coatomer has been dissociated by DMMA treatment, the g-COP appendage is able to bind to the a,b,e subcomplex, presumably through its interaction with either e-COP and/or b0 -COP. There is still a robust interaction with the W776S mutant g-COP appendage, indicating that the mode of binding of the g-COP appendage to ARFGAP2 is different from that of its binding to the a,b,e coatomer subcomplex. In light of these observations, it seems likely that in yeast cells the trafficking defect resulting from expressing `appendageless Sec21p' could result from a destabilizing effect on the heptameric coatomer complex. In summary, the structure and functional data presented here indicate that at least one accessory or regulatory protein implicated in the COPI vesicle cycle functionally interacts with the g-COP appendage, demonstrating a striking conservation of function since COPI diverged from the APs. By analogy with the situation with AP1, AP2 and GGA vesicle coats, further studies may well reveal other g-COP appendage binding partners that are involved in the regulation of the functional cycle of COPI vesicle formation and vesicle uncoating.

structure. Mutation of the tryptophan residue (W776), which is conserved at the base of the hydrophobic pockets in the g-COP and a and b2 adaptin appendages, abolishes the strong interaction of the g-COP appendage with ARFGAP2, confirming this to be the site of the interaction between these two proteins. The finding that the abolition of the interaction between Glo3p and the Sec21p appendage by a point mutation in the site on Sec21p that mediates the interaction (F836S) does not result in a trafficking defect, indicates that the interaction is either not vital for COPI vesicle formation or that Glo3p can bind to COPI at a second site. This last possibility seems the most likely, as an interaction has been detected between Glo3p and yeast b0 -COP in the two-hybrid system (13). Furthermore, Glo3p in yeast also shows partial functional redundancy with another ARFGAP, Gcs1p, making it even less likely that disrupting one of two binding sites of Glo3p on coatomer would result in a trafficking phenotype. On the other hand, the observation that a trafficking missorting phenotype is caused by deletion of the whole Sec21p appendage suggests clearly that there is at least one other interaction made by the appendage that plays an important role in COPI-coated vesicle function and that either occurs at a different site on the appendage or occurs at the same site, but that is not affected by the mutation that abolishes the Glo3p interaction. However, no other binding partners had been detected in pull-down experiments. One intriguing possibility was that such a binding partner could be the rest of coatomer itself. This possibility was suggested by the reported interactions between e-COP and the carboxy-terminal region of g-COP, and between full-length g-COP and b0 -COP in the two-hybrid system Traffic 2004; 5: 79­88

Materials and Methods
Coordinates have been deposited at the PDB code 1R4X. Experimental procedures Crystallization of the -COP appendage domain: Residues (isoform g) 608­874 of the human g-COP protein were cloned into the plasmid pMW172H6, resulting in the production of the protein as an N-terminal hexa-his fusion protein on expression in E. coli (BL21(DE3)pLysS). For incorporation of selenomethionine (SeMet), cells were grown in M9 minimal media in the presence of 50 mg/ml L-SeMet. Cells were lysed using a French pressure cell in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl (buffer A) plus protease inhibitors, and the protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The protein was further purified by gelfiltration chromatography in buffer A containing 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and concentrated to 10­15 mg/ml. The best crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 0.2 M magnesium acetate, 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 6.5), 20% PEG 8000. Crystals grow overnight, belong to space-group P212121 and diffract ° X-rays to a maximum resolution of 1.9 A. 85

Crystallographic data collection and structure determination: Crystals were flash cooled at 100 K in mother liquor containing 15% glycerol as cryoprotectant. A SAD data set was collected from a SeMet crystal at the peak wavelength for the Se anomalous signal at the 14.2 beamline (SRS Daresbury), while a native crystal was collected ° to a higher resolution of 1.9 A using longer exposures at the ID29 beamline (ESRF Grenoble) (Table 1). Initial sites ° and phases to 2.2 A were obtained from the SeMet SAD data set using autoSHARP (38), and then density modification [solvent flattening using SOLOMON (39)]. The solvent flattened phases were then combined with the native ° amplitudes and extended to 1.9 A resolution using WARPnTrace, which was able to automatically build 95% of the protein chain. This model was completed and adjusted by hand in `O' (40) and refined using REFMAC5 (38). Subsequent rounds of manual rebuilding and refinement produced a final model with Rcryst ¼ 18.4% and, Rfree ¼ 21.5%, and with excellent geometries except for a single Ramachandran violation (Asp 867). The final model comprises residues 608 through 874 of g-COP-ear plus the entire N-terminal 6 His tag, 206 water molecules and 1 Mg2þ ion. Due to the presence of cacodylate buffer in the crystallization conditions, cysteine 700 is covalently modified by the addition of a dimethylarsenic group forming S-(dimethylarsenic)cysteine.

Antibodies against ARFGAP2, ARFGAP3 and Glo3p: Polyclonal antibodies against two human orthologues of the yeast ARFGAP Glo3p, named ARFGAP2 (G. Frigerio et al., manuscript in preparation) and ARFGAP3 (41) were raised in rabbits. After affinity purification the two antibodies recognized a single major band of expected molecular weight in rat liver cytosol or extracts of Normal Rat Kidney (NRK) cells. Antibodies against yeast Glo3p have been described previously (13). Identification of binding partners of the -COP appendage domain: Wild-type and a point-mutant (W776S) of the human g-COP appendage domain (residues 608­874) were made using standard PCR procedures and cloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia, BiotechAmersham Biosciences UK Limited, Pollards Wood, Nightingales Lane, Chalfont, S St.Giles, Bucks, HP8 4SP, UK). These were then expressed in E. coli as N-terminal GST-fusion proteins and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT. Both proteins were expressed at high levels and remained soluble throughout purification. To identify binding partners of the g-COP appendage domain `GST pull-downs' were performed from rat liver cytosol in PBS and 0.05% (v/v) IGEPAL detergent (buffer B). GST-fusion proteins (50 mg) were incubated with 5 mg of rat liver cytosol in buffer B [PBS and 0.05% (v/v) IGEPAL detergent] at 4 °C for 1 h in the

presence of 50 ml of 50% slurry glutathione sepharose. The glutathione beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer B. Proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using antibodies to ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 (G. Frigerio et al., manuscript in preparation). Wild-type and a point-mutant (F836S) of the Sec21p appendage domain (residues 647­935) were cloned and proteins produced as described above. Identification of binding partners were performed by GST pull-downs from cytosol prepared from wild-type, pep4D yeast cells (which have reduced protease activity in the vacuole) (9), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using antibodies to Glo3p (13), as described above. Over-expression of the -COP appendage domain in NRK cells: The g-COP appendage domain, and W776S point mutant (residues 608­874) were cloned into the pCMVmyc plasmid (a gift from H. McMahon), so as to create an N-terminal myc-g-COP appendage domain fusion. The plasmids were transfected into NRK cells and cells were then grown for 16 h. Cells were methanol/acetone fixed and labeled for immunofluorescence using the 9E10 mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, 2145 Delaware Avenue, Santa Cruz, California 95060, USA). Cells were double-labeled with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TGN38, and ARFGAP2 or ARFGAP3. Secondary antibodies used were FITC conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and TEXAS REDÆ conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (OncogeneTM Research Products, 10394 Pacific Center Court, San Diego, California 92121, USA). Yeast plasmid and strain construction: TRP1 plasmids expressing either full-length point mutant Sec21 (F836S) or truncated Sec21 (1­647) were constructed based on pRS414 (42). To obtain haploid strains expressing truncated or point mutant Sec21, strain RDY255 (Sec21D::HIS3; harbouring pRS416::SEC21, URA3) (35), was transformed with the TRP1 plasmids (pRS414::sec21 F836S or pRS:sec21 1­647). Ura­, Trpþ colonies were selected on 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) plates. CPY sorting assay: CPY is modified in the ER to the p1 form (67 kDa) and the Golgi form [p2 (69 kDa)] before arrival in the vacuole, where it is proteolytically cleaved to the 61 kDa mature (m) enzyme; ER and Golgi forms of CPY accumulate in mutants with a secretory block at these stages (43). Radiolabeling of cells and immunoprecipitations of denatured proteins from radiolabeled extracts were performed as described (44). Cells were grown at 24 °C, to mid-logarithmic growth phase in selective minimal media. Cells were then shifted to 37 °C for 1 h, pulse-labeled for 10 min and chased for 0 min, 15 min, and 30 min at 37 °C. Total cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antiserum to CPY, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using a PhosphoImager (Figure 3C). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels, followed by quantitation using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA, Traffic 2004; 5: 79­88

USA) PhosphorImager. The anti-CPY antiserum used was a kind gift from Dr Randy Schekman (Berkeley). Isolation of and reversible modification of coatomer with DMMA: Coatomer was purified in its native state from rabbit liver cytosol using the protocol described in (45), as modified by (46). Reversible modification of the purified coatomer was carried by treatment with dimethyl malic anhydrate (DMMA) as described in (47). Interaction of coatomer with -COP ear: The interactions of coatomer with g-COP ear were analyzed using `GST pull-downs' from DMMA dissociated and undissociated, purified coatomer. GST-fusion proteins (100 mg) were incubated with coatomer samples (1 mg) for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 50 ml of 50% slurry glutathione sepharose beads. g-COP appendage fusion protein from the sample containing undissociated coatomer was isolated by centrifugation, and the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer B. The sample containing dissociated coatomer was dialyzed against 100 mM KCl/50 mM Hepes KOH, pH 6.7/1 mM DTT overnight at 4 °C to regenerate Lys e-amino-groups blocked by DMMA treatment. g-COP appendage fusion protein bound to glutathione sepharose beads was isolated as above. Dialysis of the DMMA was necessary to allow binding between g-COP appendage and coatomer to occur. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, using antibodies against the a-subunit and b0 -subunit of coatomer.
