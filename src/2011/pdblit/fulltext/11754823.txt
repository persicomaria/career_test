Abstract
According to present concepts, innate immunity plays an important role in tumor surveillance and immune modulation. The state of NK cells depends on the balance between inhibitory and activating signals from corresponding receptors. As one of the activating receptors, NKG2D recognises some self ligands such as MICA/B in human and Rae1 in mice, which is dissimilar to those toll-like receptors that recognise some pathogen-derived ligands. NKG2D is expressed not only on NK cells, but on gd T cells, CD8+ ab T cells in normal individuals and CD4+ ab T cells in rheumatoid arthritis patients and plays a different role on respective cells. Whereas NKG2D can only function as a costimulatory receptor on CD8+ ab T cells under the domination of ab TCR in spite of a deficiency of costimulatory molecule CD28, NKG2D can directly activate NK cells even in the presence of inhibitory signals from MHC-I and corresponding receptor complexes. Experiments in mice have identified that alternative splicing produces two distinct NKG2D polypeptides that associate differentially with the DAP10 and DAP12 signaling subunits and that differential expression of these isoforms and of signaling proteins determines whether NKG2D only functions as a costimulatory receptor in the adaptive immune system (CD8+ T cells) or as both a primary recognition unit and a costimulatory receptor in the innate immune system (natural killer cells and macrophages). This review summarizes the research achievements in a new ligand family (UL16 binding proteins) of NKG2D in human and shows the possible prospects of ULBP function and application. r 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

Introduction
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a type I membrane glycoprotein UL16 which is only expressed in HCMV-infected cells but not in virus particles (Kaye et al., 1992). As a new candidate immunomodulator, UL16 attracts some immunologists. David Cosman and his group screened the cDNA library of Namalwa from

a human Burkitt's lymphoma with recombinant UL16Fc protein in 2001 and found a novel membrane protein molecule which they called UL16 binding protein 1 (ULBP1) (Cosman et al., 2001). Searches of an EST database discovered two similar sequences called ULBP2 and ULBP3. In the same year, Haruo Onda et al. in another laboratory also identified ULBP2, but they called it ALCAN (Onda et al., 2001). Later, Chalupny et al. identified ULBP4 by searching the NCBI human genomic database using the amino acid sequence of ULBP1, ULBP2 and ULBP3 and the tBLASTn algorithm (Jan et al., 2003). Coincidentally, ULBP4 was also identified by Jose R. Conejo-Garcia and his group by a different method. They named it

Lymphocyte Effector cell Toxicity Activating Ligand (Letal) (Conejo-Garcia et al., 2003). Amino acid sequence analyses predict that they are 23≠26% identical with MICA and contain a1 and a2 domains as do MHC-I molecules, but do not have a3 domains (Cosman et al., 2001). Whereas ULBP1, ULBP2 and ULBP3 are GPI-linked membrane proteins, newly found ULBP4 contains predicted transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Conejo-Garcia et al., 2003; Jan et al., 2003). In 2002, murine ULBP-like transcript 1 (MULT1) was also identified. Its sequence shows great similarity with ULBP3 but possesses an extensive intracellular domain (Carayannopoulos et al., 2002). Previous research has shown that MICA as the ligand of NKG2D, which is one of the activating receptors on human NK cells, gd T cells and CD8+ ab T cells, can markedly enhance the responsiveness of those cells (Das et al., 2001; Groh et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2002). Because of the sequence and structure similarity between MICA and ULBPs, David Cosman and Marek Kubin attempted to show ULBPs' potential role in the function of NK cells and discovered that those tumor cells that were insensitive to NK cells could be lysed effectively when transfected with ULBPs and that the pathway was dependent on NKG2D (Cosman et al., 2001). Furthermore, CD3/ULBP4 co-activated CD8+ cells could effectively kill MHC-Ineg K562 erythroleukemia cells with anti-CD3 antibody, although ULBP4 alone was weak without a TCR signal and ULBP4 alone-activated lymphocytes couldn't kill K562 cells (Conejo-Garcia et al., 2003). Furthermore, although ULBP transcripts can be detected in some normal cells, they can be upregulated in some tumor cells (Cosman et al., 2001). Finally, ULBP1, ULBP2 and ULBP3 can be induced in HCMV-infected cells (Rolle et al., 2003; Welte et al., 2003). All this implies potential functions for ULBPs in immune responses to viruses and tumors.

of colon carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and cervical carcinoma (Table 2) (Pende et al., 2002). However, there is a discrepancy between the level of ULBP transcript and membrane protein on Raji tumor cells (Cosman et al., 2001). In other words, high levels of ULBP mRNA are detected in Raji cells but no detectable protein can be demonstrated on the cell surface with monoclonal antibody. Unfortunately, the distribution pattern of ULBP4 on the surface of tumor cells hasn't been documented.

The expression pattern of ULBPs
With RT-PCR technology, ULBP1, ULBP2 and ULBP3 transcripts can be detected in several normal tissues including heart, brain, lung, liver, testis, lymph node, thymus, tonsil, and bone marrow (Cosman et al., 2001). In addition, they are also abundant in fetal heart, brain, lung, and liver. However, ULBP4 mRNA is found mainly in skin and small intestine (Conejo-Garcia et al., 2003; Jan et al., 2003). The levels of ULBP transcripts and their membrane proteins are up-regulated in some tumor cells such as colon and stomach tumors, suggesting a potential role in tumor rejection (Cosman et al., 2001). For example, ULBP1 and ULBP2 are mainly expressed on the surface of T lymphoma cells (Table 1) (Pende et al., 2002). Furthermore, high levels of ULBP2 and ULBP3 are also detected on the surface

Comparison of amino acid sequence and threedimensional structure between ULBPs and MICA
Amino acid sequence analyses indicate that ULBP1, ULBP2 and ULBP3 are 55≠60% identical (Cosman et al., 2001), while newly found ULBP4 is more divergent, with greater similarity to ULBP3 than to ULBP1 or ULBP2 (Jan et al., 2003). ULBP1, ULBP2 and ULBP3 show only low homology (23≠26% identity) to MICA (Cosman et al., 2001). The amino acid sequences of ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3 and ULBP4 predict that they all contain a1 and a2 domains but no a3 domain (Conejo-Garcia et al., 2003; Cosman et al., 2001). ULBP1, ULBP2 and ULBP3 link to the membrane by virtue of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) instead of a

in the a1 and a2 domains of MICA and ULBP3 is closed off, suggesting they may not be able to bind with peptides and other small molecules (Li et al., 1999; Radaev et al., 2001). NKG2D binds diagonally across the a-helical surface of both MICA and ULBP3, similar to the mode of binding of a TCR to a MHC molecule (Li et al., 2001; Radaev et al., 2001). It should be noted that several residues contacting NKG2D receptor are conserved, especially those that are thought to contribute most of the binding energy (Raulet, 2003).

transmembrane domain (Onda et al., 2001; Cosman et al., 2001). However, ULBP4 contains predicted transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (ConejoGarcia et al., 2003; Jan et al., 2003), similar to MICA which contains a1; a2 and a3 domains but doesn't link to b2m which binds to the a3 domain of MHC-I molecules (Fig. 1). Comparison of the sequences of ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3 and MICA with those of representative classical and nonclassical MHC class I molecules indicates that they share $20% of highly conserved residues throughout the a1 and a2 domains, which clearly identifies the ULBPs as novel members of the extended MHC class I family (Cosman et al., 2001). Three-dimensional structure analyses indicate that the site corresponding to the MHC peptide-binding groove

As a MHC-I related molecule, MICA is not expressed on the surface of most normal tissues except on the intestinal epithelium and its expression can be enhanced in virus or bacteria-infected cells or tumor cells (Groh et al., 1996). Previous research showed that the expression of MICA could be regulated by promoter heat shock elements similar to those of HSP70 genes (Groh et al., 1996). Whereas retinoic acid treatment can up-regulate MIC and Rae1 family members (Cerwenka et al., 2000; Jinushi et al., 2003), it can progressively decrease ULBP4 mRNA expression in A2008 ovarian tumor cells (Conejo-Garcia et al., 2003). Furthermore, both Herpes simplex virus infection and TNF-a can enhance basal ULBP4 expression in A2008 cells (Conejo-Garcia et al., 2003). However, the mechanism of the regulation of other ULBPs at the transcriptional level is still unknown. A lot of evidence implies that there is a possibility the presence of ULBPs is regulated at the translational level in virus-infected cells and tumor cells. First, as a clue to ULBPs, the type I membrane glycoprotein UL16 encoded by HCMV can't be detected in the virus particles but mainly accumulates in the ER and cis-Golgi apparatus in HCMV-infected cells and rarely on the surface of cells (Dunn et al., 2003). Introducing full length UL16 cDNA into the C1RMICB cells can down-regulate the expression of MICB on the surface of C1R cells despite abundant intracellular staining because intracellular UL16 can bind to MICB thus retaining these ligands of NKG2D inside cells (Wu et al., 2003). Second, although HCMV can induce expression of MIC, ULBP1, ULBP2 and ULBP3 in infected fibroblasts, solely MICA and ULBP3 can reach the cellular surface to engage NKG2D, while MICB, ULBP1 and ULBP2 are selectively kept in the endoplasmic reticulum by UL16 (Welte et al., 2003). Similar results are found by other labs (Odeberg et al., 2003; Rolle et al., 2003; Vales-Gomez et al., 2003). Among these ligands, ULBP3 and some allelic MICA variants apparently have a lower affinity for NKG2D as compared to MICB, ULBP1 and ULBP2, suggesting that UL16 selectively binds to higher affinity NKG2DL, which may be sufficient to attenuate a

NKG2D-mediated anti-viral response (Welte et al., 2003). Finally, in Raji tumor cells, high levels of ULBP mRNA can be detected, but ULBP cell surface expression is undetectable (Cosman et al., 2001). However, we don't know whether this case is Rajispecific or a more extensive condition. Based on such information, establishing the cDNA libraries of Raji tumor cells and setting up a yeast two-hybrid system by using ULBPs as a bait may be helpful for validating whether there is a possibility that some tumor cells may produce another cellular protein which doesn't exist in normal cells and can function as UL16.

Known and other possible functions of ULBPs
Previous research indicated that free soluble ULBPs (sULBPs) can stimulate NK cells to secrete cytokines such as IFN-g; TNF-a and MIP-1b by engaging NKG2D (Kubin et al., 2001). Some target cells which are insensitive to NK cells can be efficiently lysed when exposed with ULBPs (Jan et al., 2003; Cosman et al., 2001). Notably, in cytotoxicity assays of NK cells, the presence of sULBP1, sULBP2 and sULBP3 during the effector phase had no effect on NK cell killing, whereas addition of a soluble form of MICA (sMICA) including the a1; a2 and a3 extracellular domains inhibited the responses of several V d1 gd T-cell clones to MICAexpressing C1R cells (Bauer et al., 1999; Kubin et al., 2001), implying different activation mechanisms for ULBPs and MICA. NK cells that are well known for their rapid responses can provide effector activities before the adaptive immune response is sufficiently developed to control the infection or tumor. Although they don't require gene rearrangement machinery to obtain diverse receptors, NK cells do clearly discriminate among potentially harmful cells such as tumor cells, infected cells and stressed cells. There are three proposed mechanisms to explain this diversity. First, the ``missing self recognition'' hypothesis is that NK cells preferentially attack cells in which MHC-I expression is reduced or abolished, while ignoring normal cells because of an inhibitory signal from MHC-I. Three families of inhibitory class I specific receptors have been identified: Ly49 (in mice, but not humans) (Chan and Takei, 1989; Karlhofer et al., 1992; Yokoyama et al., 1989), KIR (in humans, but not mice) (Colonna and Samaridis, 1995; Moretta et al., 1993; Wagtmann et al., 1995a, b), and the NKG2A receptor (both in humans and mice) (Carretero et al., 1997; Houchins et al., 1991; Lazetic et al., 1996; Vance et al., 1997). The second mechanism is the tolllike receptor system, one of the oldest strategies in evolutionary terms, which specifically recognises structures associated with microbes, including bacterial cell wall constituents, bacterial flagella and DNA. The final

mechanism is ``induced-self'' ligands such as MIC in humans and Rae1 in mice, the receptor of which is NKG2D, one of the NKG receptor family. Whereas NKG2A/B bind to CD94 to form heterodimers which are inhibitory receptors, NKG2D constitutes homodimers and functions as an activating receptor. NKG2D provides only a costimulatory signal in T cells, but can provide both activating and costimulatory signals in innate immune system cells such as NK cells and macrophages (Diefenbach et al., 2002; Gilfillan et al., 2002). Experiments in mice have identified two distinct adapters which NKG2D recruits to trigger NK cell activation and costimulation because NKG2D lacks a tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in its cytoplasmic tail and can't function as a single receptor. NKG2D has two splice variants, the longer of which (NKG2DL) only binds to DAP10 which contains ITAM motifs to costimulate CD8+ T cells, while the shorter one (NKG2DS) can couple with DAP10 or DAP12 to activate or costimulate NK cells, respectively (Diefenbach et al., 2002; Gilfillan et al., 2002). However, the regulating mechanism in humans hasn't been determined. Because of the extensive expression pattern of NKG2D on immunocytes, ULBPs may have more potential functions in the immune system. As we know, NKG2D is expressed on several immunocytes including NK cells, CD8+ ab T cells, and gd T cells in peripheral blood and intestinal epithelium in human (Raulet, 2003). Although NKG2D isn't expressed on macrophages, monocytes and normal CD4+ ab T cells, it can be expressed on the surface of CD4+ ab T cells in rheumatoid arthritis patients (Raulet, 2003). CD3/ ULBP4 co-activated CD8+ cells could effectively kill MHC-Ineg K562 erythroleukemia cells with anti-CD3 antibody, although ULBP4 alone was weak without a TCR signal and ULBP4 alone-activated lymphocytes couldn't kill K562 cells (Conejo-Garcia et al., 2003). Similarly, MICA on the surface of virus-infected cells can costimulate CD8+ ab T cells by engaging NKG2D (Groh et al., 2001). Furthermore, MICA can also enhance the antigen-dependent effector function of g9d2 T cells in peripheral blood (Das et al., 2001). Tetramers of MICA can also bind to gd1 TCR, but such tetramer binding is restricted to TCRs derived from responder T cell clones classified as reactive against a broad range of MIC-expressing target cells and is abrogated when TCRs are composed of mismatched g- and d-chains (Wu et al., 2002). MICA can deliver both the TCR-dependent signal 1 and the NKG2Ddependent costimulatory signal 2 (Wu et al., 2002). Because of the structural similarity of the extracellular domains between ULBPs and MICA, ULBPs may function similarly in gd T cells and may cooperate with MICA or other unknown ligands to engage NKG2D.

Fig. 2. ULBPs engage NKG2D/DAP10 and trigger multiple signal transduction pathways in human NK cells.

ULBP-NKG2D/DAP10 interaction triggers calcium mobilization and activation of the PI3-K/Akt, MEK/ ERK, and JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway (Sutherland et al., 2002). Costimulation of NK cells with ULBPs and IL-12 greatly enhances the production of multiple cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 2) (Sutherland et al., 2002). In spite of the description of the ULBPs-NKG2D signal transduction pathway in NK cells, it is unknown whether other NKG2D+ immunocytes apply the same or similar pathways. Furthermore, although Jennifer Wu et al. have proved that d1B T cells do not respond to ULBPs-C1R cells (Wu et al., 2002), this doesn't mean that all d1 T cells are incapable of killing ULBPs-C1R cells because they added MICB-C1R cells as a stimulator in the process of culturing d1B T cells (Groh et al., 1998). So, it's very possible that those d1 T cells that can respond to ULBPs-C1R cells were ``negatively selected'' in culture. If ULBPs do function as a stimulator to engage d1 TCR and deliver a signal, what's the signaling pathway? Is there a correlation between the signaling pathway of d1 TCR and the one of NKG2D?

such ligands could grow into progressive tumors when subcutaneously inoculated into mice (Diefenbach et al., 2001). Rejection is mediated by NK cells and or CD8+ T cells (Diefenbach et al., 2001). The ligand-transfected tumor cells will induce potent priming of specific cytotoxic T cells and sensitization of NK cells in vivo (Diefenbach et al., 2001). In other words, mice that were inoculated with live or irradiated tumor cells expressing Rae1 or H60 can specifically reject subsequent challenge with the same tumor cells lacking NKG2D ligands. In human, previous studies have shown the important role of MICA in tumor immunity, suggesting ULBPs may contribute to tumor surveillance and rejection. Although the soluble form of MICA (sMICA) encompassing the three extracellular domains has not be found in normal individuals, high levels of sMICA can be detected in some tumor patients and expression of NKG2D is reduced markedly on large numbers of tumor-infiltrating and matched peripheral blood T cells from individuals with cancer (Groh et al., 2002; Salih et al., 2002, 2003). Such release of MICA from tumor cells is mediated by metalloproteinases (Salih et al., 2002). Binding of MIC can induce endocytosis and degradation of NKG2D, causing severe impairment of the responsiveness of tumor-antigen-specific effector T cells (Groh et al., 2002). Although ULBP2 is not only bound on cell surfaces but can be secreted into the culture supernatant in in vitro culture experiments (Onda et al., 2001), as yet there are no reports on the presence of soluble ULBPs in tumor patients. So we still can't exclude the possibility that some ULBP-expressing tumor cells avoid immune attack by virtue of a similar mechanism.

Possible role of ULBPs in autoimmune diseases
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, the severity of autoimmune and inflammatory joint disease correlates with large numbers of CD4+ CD28¿ T cells, which are scarce in healthy individuals (Groh et al., 2003). First, although NKG2D receptor isn't expressed on normal CD4 T cells, it can be detected on the surface of CD4+ CD28¿ T cells in peripheral blood and synovial tissue of RA patients (Groh et al., 2003). Second, whilst substantial amounts of synoviocyte-derived soluble MICA are present in peripheral blood serum samples of RA patients, it fails to induce down-regulation of NKG2D because of the existence of TNF-a and IL-15 in peripheral blood serum and inflamed synovia of RA patients which has the opposite effect of inducing the expression of NKG2D (Groh et al., 2003). An extensive dysregulation of NKG2D and its ligand MICA may cause autoreactive T cell stimulation and then promote the self-destroying pathology in RA and possibly other autoimmune diseases (Groh et al., 2003), suggesting

Potential role of ULBPs in tumor immunity
Tumor-associated ligands can stimulate innate and adaptive immunity to promote tumor rejection by engaging NKG2D on immunocytes. Results of several researches in vitro indicated that C1R and Daudi tumor cells, that are insensitive to gd1 T cells coming from epithelium, can be lysed effectively when these tumor cells are transfected with MICA or MICB (Groh et al., 1998). Furthermore, Andreas Diefenbach and his group performed an experiment in mice and argued the possibility of using the ligands of NKG2D as components of vaccine. They showed that some tumor cells such as EL-4, RMA, B16-BL6 all coming from C57BL/6 mice could be rejected by syngeneic mice when these tumor cells were transfected with Rae-1 or H60, ligands of NKG2D in mice, whereas those that didn't express

another ligand of NKG2D such as ULBPs may have a similar potentiality to contribute to the start or development of autoimmune disease.

Concluding remarks
The NKG2D-ligand system seems to have evolved to function as a multi-functional sentinel system to alert the immune system in response to infections and tumors. Because of this important role of the NKG2D-ligand system in the immune system, some meaningful achievements have been made but further research is still needed. In the first place, MICA can markedly enhance the responsiveness of NK cells, gd T cells and CD8+ ab T cells (Das et al., 2001; Groh et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2002). Although some research in vitro has shown the contribution of ULBPs to NK cell cytotoxicity, there is no corresponding research or information about the potential function of ULBPs in other immunocytes. Second, in spite of the difference in expression of NKG2D ligands between normal cells, tumor cells and virus-infected cells, the detailed mechanisms regulating expression haven't been documented. Of course, it's very possible that some other unfound NKG2D ligands exist, and these ligands may cooperate with each other. Finally, the fate of UL16-MICB or UL16-ULBP1 or UL16-ULBP2 complexes in HCMV-infected cells is unknown. From another biological view, a new technology to ``knock out'' the membrane protein instead of RNAi or ubiquitin-dependent protein knock-out technology would be useful in order to study the function of the membrane protein. Further extensive research will be helpful in elucidating the recognition mechanism of gd1 TCR, the all-round function of the NKG2D-ligand system in human and the development of tumor vaccines.
