the design of the synthetic antigens and synthetic vaccines, primary consideration should be given to the choice of the carrier. Since small peptides which are being used as the relevant antigenic determinants are likely to be poor immunogens as such, the augmentation of their immunogenic capacity by the carrier or any other means is crucial for the induction of immunity. In the present study, we explored several approaches for the enhancement of the immune response towards synthetic peptides derived from the B-subunit of cholera toxin. The results indicate that the use of tetanus toxoid as a macromolecular carrier, polymerization of the peptide without any external carrier and the conjugation of dipalmityl side chain had comparable effects in enhancing the immune response to several synthetic peptides. This effect was manifested both at the level of antibodies produced and in their capacity to neutralize the biological activity of the cholera toxin. Prior exposure to the carrier resulted in a dose-dependent suppression against the synthetic epitope attached to it.

INTRODUCTION

In the last few years there have been many reports on the possible use of synthetic peptides as the basis for synthetic bacterial, viral or hormonal vaccines [reviewed in Arnon et al. (1983) and Sutcliffe et al. (1983)]. In most of these reports the synthetic peptide was coupled to a protein carrier for the purpose of immunization, since small synthetic peptides are liable to be poor immunogens. From the results it became clear that, beside the selection of the appropriate antigenic determinant, the choice of carrier is of great importance. Carriers such as bovine serum albumin, chicken immunoglobulin or KLH*, being potent immunogens, were indeed efficient in leading to antibody induction by the peptides; however, it is obvious that such carriers are unacceptable for use in human vaccines. The inclusion of a carrier such as KLH negates some of the advantages of a defined synthetic vaccine, and problems of hypersensitivity to the carrier may occur when repeated injections are necessary. Because of the above aspects TT might be considered as a more adequate carrier. This protein has been used recently as a carrier for both a synthetic peptide (Arnon et al., 1981) and blood group polysaccharides (Jennings and Lugowski, 1981). The advantage of TT over other protein carriers is that, although it is an efficient immunogen, it has been an

approved agent for human use for many years. Among other approaches applied to studies on synthetic vaccines is the use of polymerized peptides without an external carrier (Audibert et al., 1982) and the conjugation of fatty acids such as palmitic acid without the use of a macromolecular carrier (Hopp, 1984). We have recently reported that synthetic peptides derived from the B-subunit of CT, conjugated to TT, are efficient in the induction of the anti-CT response with neutralizing capacity (Jacob et al., 1983, 1984). The purpose of the present study was to explore the possibility of using other carriers in this system, as well as to investigate the effect of previous exposure to the carriers on the response against the antigenic determinant attached to it.

CT was purchased from Schwartz-Mann, Orangeburg, NY. Poly (DL-danyl)--pOly (L-lysine) (A--L), was prepared as described by Sela et al. (1956). Crude TT was obtained from Raffa Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel and further purified by a 15-30% ammonium sulfate cut followed by separation on Sephadex G-100, concentration and dialysis against PBS. The bis-t-butyloxycarbonyl derivative of lysine was prepared by Mr I. Jacobson (Department of Biophysics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). All other t -butyloxycarbonyl derivatives of the various amino acids were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All other reagents were of analytical grade or the best grade available. Peptides derived from the B-subunit of CT were synthesized by a solid-phase method as previously

described (Jacob et N/., 1983). The peptides used in this publication include the sequences 8-20 (CTPI). 50-64 (CTP3). 69-85 (CTP4) and 83- 97 (CTP6) (see Table 1).

The peptides were attached either to TT (mol. wt 150,000) or to the synthetic carrier A--L (mol. wt 100,000). The synthetic peptide (IO-20 mg) was added to 20-25 mg of protein carrier in PBS, followed by the addition of IO-fold molar excess over the peptide of I-ethyl-3-(3'dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride. The mixture was stirred at room temp for 18 hr, dialyzed against 0.1 M NH,HCO-, and lyophilized. The peptides were also conjugated to TT uia an azo bond. While still on the resin, the peptide was elongated by reaction with r-butyloxycarbonyl paminophenylacetic acid prior to the cleavage with hydrogen fluoride. The p-aminophenylacetic acid derivatives of the peptides were dissolved in cold 2 M hydrogen chloride, diazotised by addition of ice-cold aq. 0.1 M sodium nitrite, and added to a solution of TT in 0.5 M NaHCO,, while maintaining the pH at 8.5 by the addition of cont. Na,CO, (Spirer et cd., 1977). After 10 hr at 4 C, the mixture was dialyzed against 1 A4 NH,HCO,. The peptide content of the conjugates was determined by amino acid analysis compared to the amino acid content of TT (Bizzini et ul., 1970) and by trace labeling with `251, when possible. To polymerize peptides, 15 mg of peptide in 2 ml of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate was mixed with aq. gluteraldehyde solution (257:, Merck) to obtain a final concn of 0.1%. The mixture was stirred for 3 days at room temp in the dark. The conjugate was dialyzed against PBS.

Rabbits were immunized by multisite intradermal injections. Peptide-carrier conjugates were administered in a I-mg dose in FCA. Peptide polymers and palmitic acid conjugates were given in IOO-pg doses. Animals were boosted I month later with the same amount in FIA. Additional boosters were given if needed.
Solid-phuse RJA

This was performed according to Greenberg et u/. (1979) as previously described (Jacob et cd., 1983).
immunoblotting procedure

CT, separated into its subunits on a 5-l So/, sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel, was transfered to nitrocellulose sheet, cut into strips and incubated with I : 100 dilution of different antisera for 1-2 hr at room temp. After thorough washing the strips were incubated for l-2 hr with `251-labelled protein A (5 x lO'cpm/ml). The washed and dried blots were autoradiographed.

Inhibition of CT-induced CAMP by the various antisera was performed by incubation of 50 ng of CT with the various antisera at 1: 10 dilution for 1 hr at room temp and then added to 250,000 freshly prepared dispersed kidney cells for 3 hr at room temp. The CAMP assay was carried out according to Harper and Brooker (1975) as described by Jacob et al. (1984).

Palmitic acid was coupled to the peptides CTP3 and CTPI via an N-terminal lysine residue, which in turn was derivatized by the linkage of palmitic acid at both the a- and c-amino groups. The synthesis was performed using the Merrifield solid-phase synthesis, using the bis-t-butyloxycarbonyl derivative of the amino acid lysine. After deprotection of the lysine by trifluoroacetic acid, the palmitic acid moieties were coupled by the anhydride method as used for amino acid coupling (Hopp, 1984).

The synthesized peptides correspond to several regions of the B-subunit of CT (Table I). The only change from the native sequence was the replacement of cysteine residues at positions 9 and 86 in CTPI and CTP6, respectively, by alanine, to avoid formation of aggregates. The purified peptides were conjugated to TT or the synthetic A--L carrier by using a watersoluble carbodiimide as a coupling agent. Alternatively, the peptides were linked via an azo bond, employing their p-aminophenylacetic acid derivatives. The advantage of this method is its specificity, since the linkage occurs only between the amino terminal group of the p-aminophenylactic acid and histidine or tyrosine residues on the carrier (Spirer et u/., 1977). Both methods of coupling yielded an adequate amount of conjugation (Table 2). These conjugates were administered to groups of three rabbits per conjugate. No significant differences were observed in antibody response towards the conjugates obtained by the two procedures (results not shown). In addition to preparation of conjugates, CTP3 and CTP6 were also polymerized and administered

without carrier. Alternatively, these peptides were derivatized by coupling of palmitic acid to the amino terminal lysine residue. Immunization with the dipalmityl derivatives of CTPl and CTP3 was carried out without the use of carriers. Simultaneous immunization with two peptides, CTPl and CTP3, was carried out in order to evaluate whether the combined immune response might lead to augmentation of the neutralizing effect achieved by each peptide separately. The peptides were administered to rabbits when bound together to the same TT carrier, or when presented on separate carrier molecules. In addition, a polymerized form was given without any carrier. The immune responses elicited by the various conjugates and derivatives of the CT peptides are depicted in Figs 14. As shown, in most cases, the conjugates to TT, the polymerized derivatives, as well as the dipalmityl compounds gave rise to a high-titer anti-peptide response, whereas the response to the A--L conjugate was marginal, and the free peptide did not elicit a significant level of antibodies. Parallel phenomena were observed for the crossreactivity with the intact CT, but the extent of reactivity varied for the different peptides. The highest cross-reactivity with CT was elicited in response to the conjugates and derivatives of the peptide CTP3 (Fig. 2) Derivatives of CTPl (Fig. l), CTP4 (Fig. 3) and CTP6 (Fig. 4) elicited a much lower crossreactivity. The free peptides as well as CTP3-A--L and CTPLCA--L conjugates were found to be noncross-reactive with the native toxin. In the case of combined immunization with the two peptides CTPI and CTP3, a positive anti-peptide titer was obtained against both peptides (Fig, 5) slightly higher when the peptides were administered on a separate TT carrier molecule, and comparable to the titer of antibodies elicited by the TT conjugates of the individual peptides alone (Figs 1 and 2). The response to native CT was also better when the two peptides

were bound to separate carrier molecules than when bound together to the same carrier. However, when compared to the data obtained with the individual peptides either as TT conjugates or in the polymerized form, there was no elevation in the anti-CT binding as a result of the combined immunization.

The purpose of this series of experiments was to check whether exposure to the TT carrier alone, prior to immunization with the peptide-TT conjugate, might affect the anti-peptide immunity. Five groups of rabbits were compared, one immunized and boosted with CTP3 TT. whereas the others were injected first with various doses of the carrier TT. and only subsequently immunized with the CTP3-TT conjugate. The results of these experiments are given in Table 3. As shown, secondary as well as primary responses to CTP3 were suppressed in rabbits that were pretreated with TT. The antibody suppression observed is epitope-specific, as the antibody response to the TT carrier was not affected at all. It is noteworthy that this suppression is dose-dependent and was not observed with relatively low doses of the TT.
DISCUSSION

The sera against the various peptide conjugates were evaluated for their capacity to neutralize the biological activity of the CT, as manifested by the toxin-induced adenylate cyclase. The inhibitory effect on CAMP production, brought about by the various antisera, is shown in Fig. 7. As demonstrated, antibodies against CTPI-TT and CTP3-TT conjugates caused the highest inhibitory effect as evidenced by a 65--70x inhibition of CT-induced CAMP. Antisera against dipalmityl-lysylCTP3 and CTP3 polymer were also good inhibitors of the CT activity, causing about 60 and 50% reduction in CAMP levels, respectively. Dipalmityllysyl-CTPI was significantly less effective than the TT conjugate of this peptide. Combined administration of CTPl and CTP3 on different carrier molecules was also effective in inhibiting the extent of CAMP production, although not more than the immunization with the conjugates of each peptide alone. On the other hand, the administration of both peptides on

The results presented in this study indicate that augmentation of the immune response against a synthetic peptide is possible by using various approaches. Thus, the use of TT as a macromolecular carrier, polymerization of the peptide without an external carrier, and the conjugation of dipalmityl side chains, all had comparable effects on the level of either the homologous anti-peptide response or the cross-reactive response against the intact CT. This was true for several peptides derived from the CT B-subunit. When a macromolecular carrier is being used, the extent of the response depends on its nature. Thus the synthetic branched polymer A--L was not an efficient carrier and did not lead to a significant antibody production against the CT peptides as compared to the immunization with the respective free peptides.

The polyacrylamide gel electrophoresed intact CT was transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet, strips of which were reacted with 1: 100 dilution of the indicated antisera. The positions of the A- and B-subunits of CT are shown.

A--L carrier proved to be efficient in other synthetic peptide systems such as lysozyme (Arnon et al., 1971), MS-2 bacteriophage (Langbeheim et al., 1976) and diphtheria toxin (Audibert et al., 1982), as well as influenza hemagglutinin (Miiller et al., 1982). These results indicate that the suitability of a carrier is correlated with the characteristics and specificity of the antigenic determinant coupled to it. The effect of palmitic acid is of interest. Already Rude et al. (1971) have shown that attachment of a lipid moiety such as lauric acid causes an augmentation of the immunogenicity of soluble antigens. Stark et al. (1980) also showed enhanced immunogenicity of lipid-conjugated proteins. Hopp (1984) applied the conjugation of dipalmityl lysine for enhancement of the antigenicity of synthetic peptides,

and has demonstrated that an efficient anti-hepatitis B surface antigen response was obtained with such conjugates. Hopp (1984) reported that the dipalmityl conjugates were even more effective than KLH conjugates. However, the present results indicate a higher efficacy of protein carrier such as TT over dipalmityl lysine, e.g. in the case of CTPl. Nevertheless, this addition of lipid moiety is sufficient for the induction of antibodies against the intact CT. Polymerization seems to be a decisive parameter in endowing an antigen with immunogenic properties. This applies not only for synthetic peptides but also for native proteins. Several proteins of relatively low mol. wt, such as cytochrome c (Reichlin et al., 1970) or monomeric flagellin (Nossal et al., 1964), which are rather poor immunogens as such, can be rendered

when administered in a polymeric form. This phenomenon was shown also for synthetic peptides such as the tetrad~apeptide of diphtherja toxin (Audibert et al., 1981). In our study this parameter was checked for two of the peptides, CTP3 and CTP6, and the results demonstrated that polymerization was indeed effective in augmentation of the antibody production. In the case of CTP3 the polymer was as effective as the conjugate with TT. The advantage of polymerization is that it can be readily applied when there is more than one peptide. In such case, the resultant polymer leads to efficient immunization against both peptides, to an extent similar to that where the two peptides are attached to a macromolecuIar carrier (Fig. 6). The usefulness of a vaccine is usually determined not by the titer and immunochemical reactivity of the antibodies it induces but, rather, by its biological neutralizing eflectivity. Considering this aspect, the results demonstrate that all three approaches we empioyed endowed the small synthetic peptides with
more immunogenic

immunogenic properties (Fig. 7), the highest response being obtained with the protein conjugates. Using Ihe latter measure, it is of interest that, when the peptides are attached to the same carrier molecule, their effectiveness is considerably lower than when each peptide is attached separately. The reason for this phenomenon is not clear, but it has been observed in other systems as well (unpublished data). The last parameter addressed in the present investigation is the effect of prior exposure to the carrier on the immune response towards epitopes attached to it. This argument is of special significance when one considers TT as a carrier for human vaccines, in view of its worldwide use for anti-tetanus vaccination. The results in Table 3, demonstrating a dose-dependent, epitope-specific suppression by the carrier, are a factor that should be borne in mind. However, the quantity of TT used in human vaccines is small, and probably is below the threshold of suppressive activity.
