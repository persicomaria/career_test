Constitutive phycocyanin from cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon (Calothrix sp. PCC 7601) grown in green light, has been isolated and crystallized. The crystals belong to the space group R3 with cell constants a = b = 180,26 d, e = 61.24 .&, c( = j? = 90", y = 120". The crystal structure has been determined by Patterson search techniques using the molecular model of C-phycocyanin from the cyanobacterium Agmenellum quadruplicatum. The asymmetric unit of the crystal cell consists of two (c&monomers related by a local dyad. Three asymmetric units are arranged around a crystallographic triad and form an (afl)B-hexamer, the functional unit in the native antenna rod. The initial structure has been refined in a cyclic manner by energy-restrained crystallographic refinement and modelling until the conventional crystallographic R-factor converged at 18.1 ye with data to a resolution of 1.66 8. The molecular structure resembles closely the C-phycocyanins of Mastigoeladus laminosus and A. quadruplicatum. The conformation and configuration of the a-84 and b-84 chromophores is very similar to the corresponding chromophores in the trimeric C-phycocyanin of M. laminosus, whereas the p-155 chromophore differs in configuration with C,,,-2, Co,,-2 and Co,,-2 compared to of the P-155 chiral centres is C&,-R C,,,-R and q`q-2, C,l& c,, 5)-2,E.

The amino acid sequences of constitutive and inducible phycocyanin differ mainly in residues located on the surface of the b-subunits that mediate the inter-hexameric contacts.

1. Introduction
In photosynthesis, light energy used by photosynthetic organisms is converted into chemical energy. In the primary photosynthetic reactions, the incident sunlight is trapped by antenna systems and its energy conducted to the photosynthetic reaction centres, where charge separation across the thylakoid membrane occurs. Photosynthetic antennae consist of supramolecular pigmentprotein complexes. Pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids are found in the globular bacteriochlorophyll a binding protein-in the transmembrane antennae (LHl and LH2) of purple bacteria, in chlorosomes of green photosynthetic bacteria and the chloroplasts of higher plants. In these antenna systems, the pigments are non-covat Present address: Kantonales Laboratorium Aagau, Kunsthausweg 24, CH-5000 Aarau, Switzerland. $ Author to whom all correspondence should be addressed. 577

lently bound to apoproteins. In the antenna systems of cyanobacteria (blue green algae), eukaryotic red algae and cryptomonads, bilin chromophores are found and bound covalently to the apoproteins. The pigment-protein complexes in these organisms are arranged in water-soluble complexes called phycobilisomes, hemidiscoidal or hemiellipsoidal aggregates forming regular arrays on the surface of thylakoid membrane. Phycobilisomes are composed of phycobiliproteins and linker proteins. The phycobiliproteins are phycoerythrin (PEG) and phycoQAbbreviations used: PE, phycoerythrin; PEG, phycoerythrocyanin; APC, allophycocyanin; PCAQ, phycocyanin from Agmenellum quadruplicatum; PCML, phycocyanin from Mastigocladus laminosus; PC,, PC,, constitutive and inducible phycocyanin from Fremyella diplosiphon.

erythrocyanin (PEC), which are located on the tips of the antenna substructures, phycocyanin (PC) in the middle of the antenna rod and an allophycocyanin (APC) core that is in close proximity to the reaction centre. The spatial arrangement of the components makes the phycobilisome an ideal lighttransducer with a very light overall quantum effciency of approximately 100% (Sauer, 1975). The phycobiliproteins extend the spectral range of the trapped sunlight and funnel energy to the region centres. Preliminary crystallographic studies on phycobiliproteins have been reported (Dobler et al., 1972; Hackert et al., 1977; Sweet et al., 1977; Fischer et al., 1980; Riimbeli et al., 1985) and the three-dimensional structures of three phycobiliproteins have been solved at high resolution (Schirmer et al., 1985, 1986, 1987; Duerring et al., 1990). All phycobiliproteins have very similar three-dimensional structures. The basic building block is composed of an (#)-monomer. Both ct and /?-chains have a backbone conformaton related to globins (Schirmer et al., 1986). Eight helical segments (termed X2 Y, A, B, E, F, G and H) are the dominant secondary structure elements. In C-phycocyanins, the a-subunit carries one phycocyanobilin chromophore covalently bound to cysteine a-84, whereas the p-subunit carries two phycocyanobilins at cysteine p-84 and p-155, respectively. In PEC, the a-84 chromophore is a chemically different phycobiliviolin and in PE, the chromophores are phycoerythrobilins or phycourobilins. Three (@)-monomers are arranged around a 3-fold symmetry axis and form an (a&-trimer. Two trimers are associated face-to-face to form an (a/?),-hexamer, which is the functional unit in the native antenna (Schirmer et al., 1986). (For reviews, see Glazer, 1984, 1985, 1989; Zuber, 1985, 1986; MacColl & Guard-Friar, 1987; Huber, 1989.) Some phycobiliprotein-containing organisms have the ability to alter the composition and the size of the phycobilisome antennae with light quality. This called complementary chromatin phenomenon, adaptation (Bogorad, 1975; Tandeau de Marsac, 1983), enables the organism to adjust to the prevalent spectrum of the incident sunlight. genes of the chromatically Phycobiliprotein adapting cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon (Calothriz sp. PCC 7601) have been isolated, characterized and sequenced (Conley et al., 1985, 1986, 1988; Maze1 et aZ., 1986, 1988). A multigene family encodes the OL and b-chains of the different phycobiliproteins. Under green light, the phycobilisome rods are composed of three distal hexamers of PE attached to a constitutive phycocyanin (PC,) that is always present, independent from the wavelength of the incident light. An inducible operon, encoding PCi (inducible phycocyanin) is expressed only under red light and the phycobilisome rods carry two hexameric PC, instead of three PE hexamers. Here, we report three-dimensional structure of PC, from F. diplosiphon at 1.66 A resolution (1 A = O-1 nm). It is the first phycocyanin of known three-

structure from a chromatically dimensional adapting organism. The model helps toward an understanding of the phenomenon of complementary chromatic adaptation. Among all phycobiliprotein structures, PC, is so far the highest resolved and is therefore a good basis for precise energy transfer calculations.

(a) &?xp?erimental procedures 3'. diplosiphon (UTEX 590) cultures were purchased Algenkulturen, fiir from the Sammlung Universitiit, Institut der Pflanzenphysiologisches Nikolausbergerweg 18, D-8400 Giittingen. They were transferred to BG,i medium (Rippka et al., 1979) and grown under continuous green light (neon light source, &ram power star H&I-T 250WIDqH 4; green-filter. Riihm 7778) at a temperature of 28°C. After 4 weeks, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 11,000 g and washed once with fresh medium. At this stage, one part of the cell mass was shock-frozen and st.ored at -20°C. Cells (20 g) were suspended in a buffer containing

20 rnM-potassium phosphate

(pH 8.0), 2 rnM-EDTA,

002% (w/v) sodium azide. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of the same buffer and mixed with glass beads (@IL?to 0.2 mm diam.). Cells were broken up in a cell mill for 10 min. The mixture was then washed twice with phosphate buffer and centrifuged a,t 12,000 g to remove glass beads and disrupted cells from the solution. The supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 140,000 g for 2 h. The protein in the supernatant was precipitated by a stepwise increase of the ammonium sulphate concent,ration to 30%, 40% (mainly PE precipitated) and ?0"/6 (mainly PC and APC precipitated), followed by centrifugation at 48,000 g for 20 min. The pellet of t,he 70% precipitation was dissolved in 5 mM-potassium phosphate (pH 65), 2 m&r-EDTA, OO:!qi, sodium azide and dialysed overnight at 4°C against the same buffer. separated by The phycobiliproteins were (30 cm x 2% cm DEAE-cellulose chromatography column). Approximately 5 ml of protein solution (approx. 05 g of protein) was applied t)o the column and eluted at a flow-rate of 40 ml/h until the eluate became pink. Then the column was eluted using a 5 mM to 200 mm-potassium phosphate gradient at a flow-rate of 80 ml/h. Phycocyanin was washed out at a concentration of 100 mm-potassium phosphate. The pooled fractions were concentrated to a protein content of 20 mg/ml and dialysed against 120 mivr-sodium chloride, 50 rnAqphosphate (pH 7.4), 0020/, sodium azide. Then 150 JLI of protein solution was applied to a molecular sieve (Superose 12) column and eluted at a flow-rate of 0.1 ml/min. The PC-cont'aining fractions were pooled and dialysed against 5 miv-phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mM-EDTA; OO02u/o sodium azide, and concentrated to a protein

content of 30 mg/ml. SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7 y. to 14%), fluorescence (&,,,,= 644 nm) and absorption spectra (L,,, = 614 nm) revealed linker-free phycocyanin. In the absorption spectrum of pure PC (Fig. I), the ratios &14/ 3"se0 and &14/?b280 were 609 a.nd 613, respectively. The solution was subsequently used for further crystallization experiments.

The crystals were transferrred into a buffer containing 20% PEG, 91 M-phosphate (pH 5.0) @02% azide and sealed in a glass capillary of 1.5 mm diameter. Crystallographic characterization indicated space group R3 with cell constants a = b = 180.26 A, c = 61.24 A, CI= /I = QO", y = 120" (hexagonal setting). (c) Data collection The X-ray intensity data were collected on a FAST television area detector diffractometer (Enraf Nonius, Delft). The X-ray source was a rotating anode generator (Rigaku, Japan) operating at 5.4 kW. The apparent focal spot size was @3 x 0.3 mm'. The diffractometer was located in a thermostatically controlled room at 20°C and the crystal was additionally cooled to 4°C by a stream of cold air. The crystal-to-detector distance was 40 mm. The diffractometer was controlled by a VAX II/725 computer. The evaluation of the measured X-ray intensities on the FAST diffractometer was performed by the program packet MADNES (Messerschmidt & Pflugrath, 1987). The cell constants and the camera parameters could be refined by this program. During the data collection, the orientation parameters were regularly adjusted after 20 frames on the basis of observed and calculated reflection positions. Frames of 01" were recorded in 100 s per exposure. After collecting 1 complete data set, the crystal was tilted and the detector inclined to collect another data set with increased resolution. The intensities were scaled and corrected for absorption effects, whereby the differences in the intensities of symmetry equivalent reflections were used to determine scale factors, overall B-values and the 6 absorption ellipsoid parameters of the 3-axial (Messerschmidt et al., 1990). Additional data were collected by rotation photography on a Huber (Rimsting) rotation camera. The crystal was cooled to 5°C by a stream of cold air. The X-ray source Ru 200 rotating anode generator was a Rigaku-Denki operating at 45 kW, which produced graphite monochromatisized CuKa radiation. The apparent focal spot size

was 93 x 63 mm'. A collimator with pinholes of 94 mm and a length of 20 cm was used. The crystal-to-film distance was 45 mm. Intensity data of 1 crystal with dimensions 94 mm x 95 mm x 0.7 mm were collected within a total rotational range of 152" around the a"-axis. The rot.ation angle/exposure was 1.2". Three Kodak DEF-2 films were used per pack. Between 2 rotation photographs, 1 still photograph was taken with an exposure time of 15 min. Reflections with intensities greater than 1.2 c above background were processed further. The data set was extended to higher resolution data in the EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) outstation at the DESY (Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron) in Hamburg. Data collection was carried out at the X-11 instrument. The double focus optics allowed an adjustment of the wavelength to 1.037 A. The crystalto-film distance was 749 mm. A collimator with pinholes of 64 mm and 10 cm length was used. The rotation speed was controlled by the incident X-ray beam intensity. The rotation angle/film was 15" with a mean exposure time of 8 min. Due to radiation damage, 2 crystals were required for collecting a complete data set. The total rotational range was 90" around the a*-axis. All films were scanned on an Optronics rotating-drum film scanner (100 pm x 100 pm raster) and evaluated with the FILME program system (Schwager et al., 1975, modified by W. S. Bennett). Film and FAST data were merged and scaled using the program packet PROTEIN measurements with a (Steigemann, 1974). Individual mean standard deviation greater than 30% from the average value were discarded.

(d) Patterson search The crystal structure was solved using Patterson search techniques (Huber, 1965). As starting model, the molecular model of the from (a&-hexamer C-phycocyanin from A. quadruplicatum (PCAQ; Schirmer et al., 1986, 1987) was used, where the side-chains of nonhomologous residues were truncated to alanine. The application of search methods in direct space gave orientation parameters of the (a&e model. The program used a PROTEIN program package of the subroutine (Steigemann, 1974). The calculated rotational parameters were applied to the model, followed by a rigid body refinement, carried out by the program TRAREF (Huber & Schneider, 1985). In TRAREF, the orientation and translation parameters of the distinct CIand p-chains were refined individually, which resulted in small alterations of rotation angles and translation vectors of the model. (e) Model building and

refinement

The refined parameters for the M: and P-subunits obtained by TRAREF were applied. Structure factors and electron density were calculated, followed by inspection and manual correction on a graphics display (Evans & Sutherland) using the program system PROD0 (Jones, 1978). The formerly introduced alanine residues were exchanged for the correct residues according to the DNA sequence (Maze1 et al., 1986). Some of them could not be fitted into the density. They were omitted from following Fourier transform calculations. After the manual corrections, the model was subjected to the energy restrained crystallographic refinement program EREF (Jack & Levitt, 1978). Manual correction and energy refinement were repeated in a cyclic manner (Schirmer et al., 1987) until convergence of the R-factor was achieved.

The X-ray intensity data were collected with three different systems (FAST, rotation camera, synchrotron). The three different sets of data were internally consistent, but merging and scaling of all data resulted in increased Rmerg values. Table 1 indicates the number and quality of the measured reflections of the individual data sets and of the data after merging. Jn the Table, a relatively high R-factor of the DEW data is obvious. There may be several reasons for it. The higher resolution of the recorded reflections, slightly incorrect synchrotron polarization parameters (these parameters were estimated as Hpol= SO%, lipol= 20%), the use of data coming from two crystals with perhaps slight anisomorphy, whereas the FAST and conventional film data sets were obtained from a single crystal. After merging all data, reflections whose deviations from the mean value was above 30% were discarded, whereby the overall R-value decreased from 11.1 y. to 8.9% with a slight loss of unique reflections. Table 2 lists the completeness of the resolution shells. It shows an data in the individual increase in the outermost resolution shell from 1.66 a to 1.55 8, for which we had no explanation. The analysis was therefore limited to 1.66 8.

To analyse local symmetry elements, a selfrotation function of the Patterson map was caieulated in a resolution range of 10 A to 3.5 a. The product correlation function in direct space was calculated in the polar angle syst,em defined as $: inclination against y*: 4: azimuth relative to x and IC: rotational angle; IC, y* and z define an ort,hogonal system where x coincides with a, y* with b* and z with c. The search for a local dyad (K = 180") showed a maximum at, ($,4) = (65~0",0~0") and at symmetry equivalent positions with a height of 8S-6Q/o of the origin peak. They were indicative of a local Z-fold axis through which the two (a&monomers of the asymmetric unit are related. Figure 2 presents a plot of t'he product correlation function. The local dyad in the crystal system is perpendicular to c with an inclination angle of 25" to the b-axis. This may be compared with the location of t,he local dyad in crystals of PE from the red algae Porphyridium cruentum which also crystallize in space group R3 and have similar cell constants. There the local dpad is 48" inclined to b (Fisher et al., 1980). (ii) Cross-rotation search

The orientation of the local 2-fold axis and the location of the (a/I),-hexamer on the Y-fold crystallographic axis provides a unique solution of the crystal structure.

model, were placed in a cubic cell of a side length of 250 !I with the centre of gravity at the origin. The Fourier transform and Patterson function of this model were calculated in the resolution range of 10 A to 3.5 A. From the Patterson map the 2473 highest maxima were selected and correlated with the Patterson map of PC, by rotating it in steps of 5" around Z, followed by calculation of the product function. A clear maximum with height Rkorr= 141.2 (arbitrary units) appeared at O,= 2650" (where O3 is the dihedral rotation angle around the z-axis) and at symmetry-related positions. The next highest peak at unrelated positions was 118.82. This solution is consistent with the self-rotation function. The model was rotated 265" around the z-axis and refinement initiated.

were refined and yielded small changes. After four TRAREF cycles, the R-factor decreased from 43.2% to 39.5 y. (Table 3). (d) Model building and energy re$nement

In order to allow possible relative shifts of the individual (@)-monomers within the hexamers that had served as the search model, the program TRAREF was applied to the model. For this, one was placed into the origin of a cubic (a&-monomer cell with a side length of 250 A. A Fourier transform was calculated within the resolution limits of 10 A to 3 A. The orientation and translation parameters

The refined orientation parameters obtained by TRAREF were applied to the model. Fourier transform and electron density were calculated in the resoluton range of 10 a to 3 A. The DNA seyuence (Maze1 et al., 1988) was built into the model. Residues that could not be fitted into the electron density were omitted from the phase calculation in the next refinement cycle. of The model was subjected to a cyclic refinement the conformational parameters, followed by manual correction at the graphics display (Table 4). After (Schirmer et al., 1987), the third EREF macrocycle water molecules were added to the model. They were built when they were stereochemically plausible and both ZF,, - F, and F,- F, difference Fourier map showed high positive density. After four EREF macrocycles, the thermal parameters of the model were also refined. In EREF macrocycles 5 and 6, the temperature factor of main-chain and side.-chain atoms were refined separately, then averaged. In the last three EREF macrocycles, the temperature

factors of all atoms were refined individually. During this refinement, the thermal parameters of some water molecules became exceptionally high in subsequent (B > 50 8'). They were discarded rounds of refinement. In the final model, 244 water molecules were found per asymmetric unit, which corresponds to 0.36 water molecules per amino acid. A total of nine EREF macrocycles were carried out until the final R-factor converged at 18.1 y0 with data from 8 A to 1.66 A. Table 5 shows the parameters of the refined model. The overall temperature factors of the corresponding polypeptide chains of the asymmetric unit, la, ICY and l/3, S/I are similar. In Figure 3(a) and (lo), the temperature factors of the main-chain atoms are plotted as a function of residue number. They are closely but the P-chains show slightly higher similar, temperature factors than the a-chains, probably related to the fact that a-subunits mediate the tight trimer contacts while the P-chains are more exposed in the stacked hexamer contacts (see Fig. 4). This is in contrast to the PCML trimer, where b is involved into stronger (lattice) contacts and has lower p-values (Schirmer et al., 1987). The fluctuations in the B-values with a periodicity of three to four residues in the helical regions is a common feature in all the phycobiliproteins of known three-dimensional structure (Schirmer et al., 1985, 1986, 1987; Duerring et aE., 1990) and is expected for partially exposed peripheral x-helices.

The Ramachandran diagram presented in Figure 5 shows that all residues fall into allowed regions, with the exception of Thr lb-77 and Thr 6/?-77 with (4/$) angles of (90"/153") and (90"/148"), respectively.

Despite differences in species, crystal packing and aggregation states, the conformational angles of these residues are conserved. The 2F,-F, map (minimum = -2.31 e/A", maximum = 7.2 e/A', cr = 0.38 e/A3) displayed at 1.5 rr, showed continuous density for all main-chain atoms. The good resolution gave reliable information of structural details (Fig. 6). The DNA sequence (Maze1 et al., 1986) was used in the density interpretation. Some side-chain atoms, mostly located in residues on the protein surface, were badly defined: Ser 1~15, Glu lcr-46, Lys 1~47, Asn 1~70, Gln l/?-11, Arg 18-79; Asn l/3-113, Leu l/3-120, Ser 6c(-15, Arg 6a-32, Lys 6~42, Lys 6x-62, Arg 68-79, Asn 68-113 and Asp 68-146.

The residues lp-77 and 68-77 are marked. well as the CO atom of 61x-46 show weak electron density. The electron density at the side-chain of residue Ser la-21 appears branched, suggesting alternative posit,ions. These are at optimal distances from several nearby polar atoms (IV 10r-12, ODl l/?-12, OEH la-125, OG 6a-164) to be possible hydrogenbond partners. The residues ID-65 and 6fi-65 were interpret.ed as glutamine or glutamate and not as glycine as reported by Maze1 et al. e (1988). This interpret.ation was examined by an "omit" map (Pig. 7) in which the side-chain atoms of the ambiguous residue did not contribute to the phase calculation. The electron density around positions lp-72 and 68-72 suggested that, these residues are both methylated. At these positions, y-fl-methylasparagine residues (NMA) were built into the sequence. The planar carboxamide group of lb-72 (tip-72) Iies approximately parallel to the chromophore plane 18-84 (6p-84) as found in the structures of PCML and PCAQ (Duerring et al., 1988). No water molecule near at,om ND2 lb-72 (68-72) was found ir, the PC, as is present in the trimeric PCML structure, where it acts as a hydrogen-bond partner with the nitrogen atom. Since this water molecule is absent also in PCAQ, it reflects the aggregation state of the protein. The PO-PC difference Fourier map of the final maximum = (minimum = - 077 e/A3, model

For PCi, residues different from PC, are given. Insertions were introduced according to Schirmer et aZ. (1986) to optimize alignment. In the segment p-119 to p-174, 14 of the 17 exchanged residues face the next hexamer omfthe 60 A crystal period (Figs 4 and 8).

The genes encoding the polypeptide chains of constitutive phycocyanin have been isolated and sequenced (Conley et al., 1988; Maze1 et al., 1988). At several positions, the two sequences are different, possibly due to different origins of the organisms. The sequence reported by Maze1 et al. (1988) agreed with the X-ray sequence, except at residue Glx D-65 as mentioned above. Conley et al. (1988) reported glutamine at position p-65. The sequence identity between PC, and PCi is 84.6% for the a-chains. The high level of sequence homology between PC, and PCi suggests close similarity of both protein structures. In the antenna rod of the P. diplosiphon phycobilisomes, PC, or PE appear as alternative distal neighbours of PC,, depending on the growth conditions of the organism. The sequence alignment of PC, and PC, shows that the P-subunit has nearly twice as many exchanges compared with CI. In addition, these exchanges are clustered in j3 and more uniformly distributed in a. Clusters in the P-subunit are in the regions p-19 to p-34 and b-124 to p-174. The former segment includes helix Y, the latter segment helices G and H and the chromophore attachment site of p-155. In this segment, it is obvious that the nonidentical amino acids appear with a frequency of three to four as can be seen in the alignment below. 10 20

The two (@)-monomers of the asymmetric unit show little difference and are reflected by an almost exact local dyad symmetry (Table 6). In the crystal system, the rotation matrix - 0.98404 0.17794 0.00141 0.17793 0.98402 -0.00613 900248 - 0.00578 - 0.99998

and the translation vector (903407 A, 0.00716 A, 1 (@)-monomer - 0.31204 A) transfer the "upper" into the "lower" B(a&monomer. This corresponds to a rotation of 179.9" around the local dyad. The superposition of the C" atoms of PC, and PCAQ show close correspondence, despite species differences. There is also a close relationship in space group, in cell size and in molecular packing between PC, and PE from Porphyridium cruentum, which is an indication for closely related three-dimensional structures. The attachment sites of the extra chromophores and the additional loop of ten residues in PE are compatible with the PC folding (Huber, 1989). 30

The 2F, - E", elect,ron density shows well-resolved electron densities for all chromophores (Fig. 9).

The conform&ion stereochemistry of the chiral atoms is Cc,,-R, C(,,,-R and Cc,,-R, respectively. Chromophore b-155 has a different stereochemist,ry with 4&-R, C,,,,-S and C,,,-R. Tts configuration, C&-Z, C(,,,-Z and Cc,,,-Z, is different from PCML and PEC, respectively, where ring D has a configuration between Z and E (Fig. 10(a)). A schematic representation of a phyeocyanobilin chromophore with the atom numbering is given in Figure 10(b). The dihedral angles of all PCFR chromophore are listed in Table 8. The Z,Z,Z configuration of the p-155 chromophore is a consequence of the hexameric aggregation state of the protein whereby p-155 of subunit 1p (Fig. 4(b)) comes in contact with helices Y and H of subunit 6a in the other trimer. We had not, seen a significant difference in P-155 between the hexamerit PCAQ and the t,rimeric PCML, but note that

The spectral characteristics of the phycobiliproteins and the nature of the energy transfer are dependent on the chemical nature of the chromophore and on the surrounding protein, especially polar and aromatic residues, which tune the spectrum of the chromophore. The neighbouring amino acids keep the chromophores in a rigid conformation, which is essential for efficient energy transfer.

the analysis of PCAQ is a substantially lower resolution (25 A) th an the present PC, or the previous PCML analysis and not sufficiently discriminatory. We re'examined PCAQ and found the electron density of ring D of p-155 relatively weak, allowing both interpretations. The previous interpretation of PCAQ led to a short contact distance between atom Cl71 of rings D b-155 and atom OD2 6cl-147 (2.13 A). A Z,Z,Z configuration of the chromophore leads to a normal contact and atom 019 p-155 may form a hydrogen bond of 2% A to atom OD2 6a-147. This interaction is also observed in the j-155 chromophore in PC, where two hydrogen bonds stabilize the 2 configuration of ring D: N24 p-155 to OD2

6a-147 (3.2 A) and 019 b-155 to OEl 6a-33 (3.16 A). In the trimer of PCML and PEC, no such interaction is possible, instead the atoms in ring D of chromophore p-155 are in contact to symmetryrelated atoms of the crystal. These contacts are less tight and allow increased rotational freedom of ring D similar to the situation in solution. The change in of ring D p-155 and its rigidification configuration upon hexamer formation may be a factor explaining the increased ratio of visible to near ultraviolet absorbance (Ma&o11 & Berns, 1981) and the decrease of fluorescence lifetimes (Holzwarth et al., 1987). The different stereochemistry of atom CcS1) led us to reinvestigate the structures of PCAQ, PCML and PEC. In PCAQ and PCML, the p-155 chromophores could be fitted into the density with an S-configuration of atom Cc3rj. The electron density of PCAQ was not indicative and allowed both interpretations due to lower resolution. In PCML, a new map was calculated, in which the chromophore atoms were omitted from the phase calculation. This map clearly indicated an S-stereochemistry of atom Cc,,,. The situation in PEC was different. Although the resolution of this structure (2.7 A) is lower, the omit electron density map suggests an R configuration of atom %I) p-155. If true, this may be an additional factor for the variation in the absorption spectrum of PEC besides the different phycobiliviolin chromophore bound to cysteine a-84. In phycocyanins, the geometry of the chiral of centre at CcS1) /I- 155 seems to be independent aggregation state and species. The difference from a-84 and p-84 might be an additional factor deterthe spectral differences between the mining chromophores. et al. (1988a,b,c) Investigations by Arciero revealed that phycocyanobilins bind spontaneously to apophycocyanins. However, the experiments suggest that the in vivo attachment is under enzymic control, since the condensation products differ chemically from the naturally occurring chromophores and an addition at position b-155 was not

In phycobilisomes, energy is transferred among the chromophores. A theory derived by Foster (1948, 1967) differentiates two kinds of interactions of the chromophores. If the two participat,ing chromophores are coupled by a strong interaction, the energy is delocalized over the coupled system and the absorption spectrum cannot be derived by a superposition of its component spectra. On the other hand, in a system of two weakly interacting chromophores, the energy can be localized on one chromophore at a time and the absorption spectrum

of the whole system is therefore the sum of its components. In this theoretical framework, a treatment of the chromophores as isolated dipoles seems to be a sufficient approximation to calcula,te the energy transfer rate between distinct chromophores. The calculations (Sauer et al., 1987; Sauer & Scheer, 1988) based on the three-dimensional structures of PCML and PCAQ (Schirmer et al., 1985, 1986, 1987) were in accord with stereoscopical and kinetical studies (Schirmer & Vincent, 1987; Mimuro et al.; 1986). The energy transfer rate between two chromophores is strongly dependent on the distance between the two chromophores. A highly resolved structure allows a more reliable calculation of the energy transfer rate. The formula: L = 4ww)6> where k,, is the energy transfer rate, K' is the

the a-84 and p-84 chromophores changes drastically: Their centres of mass come to lie at a distance of 266 A and give rise to a strong interaction (Fig. 11(b)). Intra-hexamer energy transfer pathways (Fig. 11(c)) are mainly found between a-84 chromophores, since the distances and orientation factors are favourable in this arrangement. Furthermore, the p-155 chromophores become more efficiently coupled. Assuming a distance of 60 A between two distinct hexamers, only the p-84 are potential candidates for efficient inter-hexamer energy transfer (Fig. 11(d)). Calculations on the chromophore system in PCAQ and PCML (Schirmer et al., 1987) led to similar results, but a direct comparison between PCAQ and PCML might be misleading due to the different resolution of the structures. One should keep in mind that the calculations with the more highly resolved PCFR model did not result in fundamental changes of the phycobilisomal energy transfer pathways. It should be noted, however, that linker proteins, which are believed to be in the central cavity of the hexamer, play an important role in the energy transfer. This influence is observed as a red-shift of absorbance maximum when linkers are bound to the protein.

All phycobiliproteins of known three-dimensional structures have a common architecture at all levels of structure: folding of the polypeptide chain, association of a and P-subunits and formation of higher trimeric or hexameric aggregates, including stacking of hexamers. Also the chromophores have similar geometries. Chromophore b-155, which absorbs at the short wavelength edge of C-PC, differs in the configuration of ring D, which is between Z and E in the trimeric and Z in the hexameric state. In phycocyanins, p-155 also show a different stereochemistry at Cc31j compared to a-84 and j-84.
