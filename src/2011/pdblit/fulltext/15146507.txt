Introduction. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of D-isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate and CO2, with NAD (EC 1.1.1.41) or NADP (EC 1.1.1.42) as a cofactor,1 in the presence of Mn2 or Mg2 . IDHs from each of the three domains of life have been cloned and sequenced, and dimeric and multimeric IDHs have been divided into three phylogenetic subfamilies.2,3 Subfamily II is mainly comprised of eukaryal NADP -dependent IDHs. Subfamily III is comprised of NAD -dependent hetero-oligomeric mitochondrial IDHs and one NADP -dependent IDH from Thermus thermophilus.2 Subfamily I is a prokaryotic group, in which the NAD and NADP usage is widespread within archaeal and bacterial enzymes.4 All archaeal IDHs belong to subfamily I and are closely related to the IDH from Escherichia coli (EcIDH)5 and that from Bacillus subtilis IDH (BsIDH),6 whose three-dimensional structures have already been reported. The cofactor specificity of EcIDH is conferred through interactions between NADP and several amino acid residues.3,7 These residues are practically conserved in the archaeal NADP -dependent IDHs and are in accordance with cofactor specificity.4 The activity of EcIDH is regulated through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the Ser113 residue, which is catalyzed by IDH kinase/phosphatase.8 The dimeric IDH from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Aeropyrum pernix (ApIDH), also belongs to subfamily I and requires NADP as a cofactor. ApIDH is coded by an open reading frame (ORF) APE0689 and exhibits 48% amino acid sequence identity with EcIDH.4 The enzyme is the most thermostable IDH identified so far, with a melting temperature of 109.9°C. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of ApIDH. Materials and Methods. The putative ApIDH gene (accession NP_147421)9 was amplified using primers (TAACAATTGCATATGCAGGTTATGGCTTCC and CGGTAGAATTCCTCCTAGCCCCTCTTCC) and cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pET17b vector. The gene was expressed in E. coli strain JM109 (DE3) cells, and the ApIDH protein was extracted by sonication. ApIDH was purified by heat treatment (80°C for 30 min) and with butyl-Toyopearl (Tosoh), Mono-Q HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 (Amersham Biosciences) columns. Crystallization was conducted using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion

method; 2 L of protein (14 mg/mL ApIDH in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and 4 L of a reservoir solution were mixed to form a drop. The best crystallization conditions were obtained with a reservoir solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 200 mM di-ammonium citrate at a of pH 5.0. Polygon-shaped crystals (0.3 0.3 0.1 mm) that consistently diffracted up to about 2.3 Å grew at 25°C within 3 days. Prior to data collection, the crystals were briefly immersed in a cryoprotectant solution comprised of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (20% v/v) in the mother liquor. The ApIDH crystals were found to belong to tetragonal space group P43212 with unit cell dimensions of a b 107.9 and c 172.9 Å. The data were collected with an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD camera at beamline BL6A of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan), and processed using the HKL 2000 program suite.10 Molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP11 in the CCP4 program suite, using the crystal structure of EcIDH (PDB entry 4ICD) as a search model. Molecular replacement analysis gave two solutions related by a non-crystallographic two-fold symmetry operator. The angles of rotation to superpose the two monomers were 94.2° and 89.7° for the molecular replacement solution and the final refined model, respectively. ARP/wARP12 was used for automatic model building, starting from the initial phase of the molecular replacement. The whole region of chain A and part of chain B (residues 146 ­343, the small and clasp domains) were automatically built with the ARP/wARP program. For subsequent crystallographic refinement, chain A was rotated according to non-crystallographic symmetry to generate a starting model for chain B. Refinement was carried out with CNS 1.1.13 Non-crystallographic symmetry was used at the first stage of refinement, but not at the final stages, because some structural deviation from symmetry was observed, especially in the phosphorylation loop. The data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The coordinates

and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1V94. Results and Discussion. The ApIDH crystal was found to contain two subunits per asymmetric unit, which are related through a noncrystallographic two-fold axis. The final model of the ApIDH crystal structure contains residues Pro7­Gly435 of chain A, Cys9 ­Ala431 of chain B, and 243 water molecules. An overview of the ApIDH dimer is shown in Figure 1. Although electron density for chain A was clearly seen throughout the polypeptide, the density for chain B was relatively ambiguous, especially for the large domain, where there was no crystallographic contact. The average temperature factors for the whole regions of chains A and B and for the large domain of chain B were 32.5, 50.6, and 66.7 Å2, respectively. The two chains had similar structures (root mean square deviations for C and all atoms were 0.770 and 1.390 Å), except for in part of the `phosphorylation loop' region (Gly115­Ser120), as described later. Therefore, we mainly describe chain A unless otherwise noted. The ApIDH structure was very similar to those of EcIDH and BsIDH, as was expected from the extensive amino acid sequence homology [Figs. 2(a­ c)]. Each subunit of ApIDH is composed of 15 -strands and 20 -helices and can be divided into three distinct domains:

large (1­130 and 322­ 435), small (131­163 and 205­321) and clasp (164 ­204) domains. A loop region before the serine residue of ApIDH (Ser120), which corresponds to the phosphorylated serine of EcIDH, is called the `phosphorylation' loop (Pro109 ­Lys119).14 The loop region was relatively open, widening the entrance to the active site [Fig. 1(a)], unlike in the BsIDH structure.4 The loop regions of both the A and B chains had similar `open' conformations, but the B chain was more open than the A chain. Electron density for the `phosphorylation' loops and the serine residues of both chains was unambiguously observed, except for the peptide bond between Tyr118 and Arg119 of chain A (data not shown). The biological significance of such conformational variations at this loop is unknown, because there is no evidence that ApIDH or BsIDH is regulated through phosphorylation in vivo. In the small domain, the so-called `13-amino acid insert' of BsIDH (246 ­276) forms two -helices [ g2 and g3; Fig. 2(c)], whereas the corresponding region of EcIDH (255­ 272) forms two -strands [ K and L; Fig. 2(c)]. In the corresponding region of ApIDH, which is longer by only two residues than EcIDH, one short -helix (Glu263­ Glu268, g2) is followed by a loop region with no secondary structure [Fig. 2(a)]. No ligand molecules, such as NADP , isocitrate, or Mg2 , were found in the active site of the ApIDH structure, but several waters were found here. Electron density for the side chains of the residues at the Mg2 and isocitrate binding sites, including Arg126, Arg136, Arg159, Tyr166, Lys233 , Asp287 (apostrophes

indicate residues from the opposing monomer), Asp311, and Asp315, was clearly observed. ApIDH seems to be stabilized through the cumulative effects of various improvements, such as the formation of a disulfide bond (Cys9 ­Cys87) within the large domain (Fig. 3) and salt bridges on the surface. The cysteine residues forming the disulfide bond are only present in ApIDH; thus, the intradomain linkage probably contributes to thermostability. It has been noted that ApIDH exhibits a significantly increased Arg composition compared with other IDHs.4 We found numbers of salt bridges formed between these additional arginine residues (Arg31, 42, 84, 152, 180, 182, 194, 206, 210, 215, 246, 257, 284, 386, and 409) and acidic ones on the surface of the ApIDH structure. Notably, an extensive cluster of salt bridges between helices f and g1 in the large domain, including four basic residues only present in ApIDH (Arg206, Arg210, Arg215, and Lys255) and three acidic residues (Glu214, Glu250, and Glu254), was observed. On the other hand, residues at the subunit interface in the small and clasp domains are practically conserved in mesophilic IDHs. Table II.
