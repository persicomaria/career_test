MHCIb molecules serve more diverse and specialized functions than MHCIa molecules. For example, CD1 molecules present lipid antigens and M3 is a mouse MHCIb molecule with extraordinary preference for binding N-formylated peptides naturally processed by prokaryotes and mitochondria (Wang et al., 1995). The Qa-1 molecule, and its human HLA-E homolog, presents peptides from the hydrophobic leader sequence of classical MHCIa molecules to receptors on NK cells, rather than to TCRs, thereby permitting NK cells to monitor the MHCI expression status of target cells (Aldrich et al., 1994; Braud et al., 1997). The T10 and T22 molecules serve as activation markers that are recognized by T cells following immune perturbation, although they are not capable of presenting antigens (Crowley et al., 1997; Schild et al., 1994; Weintraub et al., 1994; Wingren et al., 2000). The structurally defined T22b molecule has severely modified 1 and 2 domains, as it is missing the H1 segment of the 2 helix and lacks a classical antigen-binding groove (Wingren et al., 2000). The FcRn, which binds to Ig constant (C) regions, illustrates yet another possible mode of class I-mediated immune recognition. In this case, not only is the antigen-binding groove narrowed and compromised, but recognition of Ig C regions is via the side rather than the top of the 1 and 2 domains of FcRn (Burmeister et al., 1994). The TL molecule, originally identified as a thymic leukemia tumor antigen, is encoded by T3b, T3d, T18d, and other closely related genes in the T cluster of the murine MHC locus (Cheroutre et al., 1995; Old et al., 1963). Although it was one of the first MHCIb molecules to be defined, its function has long been enigmatic. The constitutive expression of TL on epithelial cells of the small intestine in all mouse strains has suggested the possibility that TL plays an important role in mucosal immunity. Consistent with this notion, TL binds to CD8 homodimers that are expressed constitutively by many intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIEL), whereas the predominant form of CD8, the CD8 heterodimer, is expressed on conventional MHC class I restricted T cells. Moreover, the interaction of CD8 expressed by IEL with TL expressed by the antigenpresenting cells alters TCR-mediated signals leading to increased cytokine production without enhancing T cell proliferation or cytotoxicity (Leishman et al., 2001). TL directly binds to the CD8 homodimer with a significantly stronger affinity than to the CD8 heterodimer (Kd 10 M versus 100 M), an affinity that surpasses that of MHCIa molecules to either the CD8 or CD8 (Leishman et al., 2001; Moody et al., 2001). This TL/CD8 interaction, however, occurs independently of TCR and coreceptor-mediated antigen recognition. As the TL 3 domain conserves the primary CD8 docking sequences found in H-2Kb, it was expected that TL would interact with CD8. However, the basis for an augmented TL/CD8 affinity is uncertain. Moreover, whether peptide or lipid antigens can bind to TL and are

Summary TL is a nonclassical MHC class I molecule that modulates T cell activation through relatively high-affinity interaction with CD8 . To investigate how the TL/ CD8 interaction influences TCR signaling, we characterized the structure of the TL/CD8 complex using X-ray crystallography. Unlike antigen-presenting molecules, the TL antigen-binding groove is occluded by specific conformational changes. This feature eliminates antigen presentation, severely hampers direct TCR recognition, and prevents TL from participating in the TCR activation complex. At the same time, the TL/CD8 interaction is strengthened through subtle structure changes in the TL 3 domain. Thus, TL functions to sequester and redirect CD8 away from the TCR, modifying lck-dependent signaling. Introduction Classical, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encoded class I molecules or MHC class Ia molecules (MHCIa hereafter) are broadly expressed at high levels on the surface of many cell types, and they possess substantial allelic polymorphism. By contrast, the nonclassical or MHC class Ib (MHCIb hereafter) molecules are displayed at lower density. They manifest a much more restricted tissue distribution and show little genetic variation (Braud et al., 1999; Shawar et al., 1994; Stroynowski and Lindahl, 1994). In humans, the MHCIb molecules include HLA-E, -F, and -G, HFE, the MIC and ULBP proteins that bind to the NKG2D NK receptor, CD1 proteins and the FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor), as well as several other proteins of unknown function.

required for TL function is not known. Existing evidence suggests that TL does not bind antigen, as shown by both the capability to refold TL protein produced by recombinant methods in bacteria in the absence of peptide (Weber et al., 2002) and the expression of TL in TAP-deficient cell lines (Holcombe et al., 1995; Rodgers et al., 1995). On the other hand, between TL and MHCIa molecules the conservation of certain residues, which form hydrogen bonds to the N and C termini of bound peptides (Bouvier and Wiley, 1994; Matsumura et al., 1992), implicated a possible binding function in the "groove." Consistent with this conservation, there are some biochemical data indicative of TL binding to peptides (Sharma et al., 1996). To resolve these questions and define the structural basis by which TL/CD8 ligation triggers modification of the TCR-mediated activation signals, we have deter° mined the structure of the TL/CD8 complex to 2.1 A resolution. This represents the first structure of CD8 in complex with any MHCIb molecule. More importantly, our data here, in conjunction with our earlier H-2Kb/ CD8 complex structure (Kern et al., 1998), show how the antigen-presenting activity of this MHCIa-related molecule has been structurally eliminated with concurrent augmentation of CD8 binding. This information offers a view as to how CD8 functions not as a coreceptor during T cell activation but rather as a modulator of the CD8 coreceptor/TCR signaling complex formation. Results and Discussion Complex Overview of the TL(T18d)/CD8 complex The structure of the murine TL(T18d)/CD8 ° was determined to 2.1 A using the molecular replacestructure (PDB ment method with the H-2Kb/CD8 code 1bqh) as a search model. Figure 1 shows the com-

plex in a view oriented as if TL (T18d) stands on the cell membrane at the bottom and the CD8 homodimer reaches TL(T18d) from an opposing T cell above. Although the nonclassical MHCI molecule TL(T18d) is predicted to manifest different structure in conventional antigen-binding regions from that of H-2Kb (Leishman et al., 2001), we were able to utilize the entire H-2Kb/ CD8 complex for molecular replacement search, obtaining a surprisingly straightforward result. As described later, this is a consequence of the fact that within the TL(T18d)/CD8 and H-2Kb/CD8 complexes, their respective CD8 homodimers and MHC 3 and 2M domains, the major CD8 binding regions, can be super° imposed to an RMS deviation of 0.99 A for 390 C atoms. This result emphasizes the topological similarity of the CD8 binding modes of the two MHC molecules and suggests that the high affinity of TL(T18d)/CD8 binding must be a consequence of the fine tuning of detailed intermolecular interactions rather than of a distinctly different binding mode, consistent with results of recent mutation data (Devine et al., 2002). The surface buried ° ° area for the TL(T18d)/CD8 complex is 3704 A2 (1890 A2 ° ° for TL and 1814 A2 for CD8), as opposed to 3514 A2 for ° ° complex (1766 A2 for H-2Kb and 1748 A2 H-2Kb/CD8 for CD8) using the program AREAIMOL in CCP4 suite ° (CCP4, 1994) with a 1.7 A as radius probe. Strikingly, the antigen-binding groove defined by the cleft between the two helical regions of the 1 and 2 domains in a classical MHCIa is obliterated in TL(T18d). Figure 2A is the surface representation comparison of TL(T18d) versus H-2Kb viewed toward the platform. In the case of H-2Kb, the MHCI-bound VSV8 octapeptide has been removed in order to reveal the antigen-binding groove. The contrast is readily apparent: TL(T18d), unlike H-2Kb, has no space to accommodate a peptidic or lipid antigen. This finding confirms the biological observation that, as a specialized nonclassical MHCIb molecule,

Figure 2. TL-Specific Amino Acid Residues that Seal the "Antigen Binding Groove" in TL (A) The surface representation of TL (on the right) versus H-2Kb (on the left) is viewed toward the platform with the "groove" in the vertical orientation and was prepared with GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). In order to highlight the structural distinction of TL versus H-2Kb platforms, the peptide bound to H-2Kb has been removed. The deep and wide groove in the classical MHCIa molecule H-2Kb strikingly contrasts with the essentially closed groove in the nonclassical MHCIb molecule TL. In the TL/CD8 structure, a few discrete water molecules are found near where the N terminus of the bound peptide lies in a classical MHC class I structure. These waters are not shown here, leaving a small depression as seen in the upper part of the TL surface. (B) A top view of the 1 2 platform (90 rotation from Figure 2A) showing a cluster of hydrophobic residues that may play a major role in providing energy to pull the two helical regions toward one another within direct contact. TL-specific residues are colored in dark blue, whereas conserved residues are in red. In this overlay, the C trace of TL is in blue and that of H-2Kb with bound peptide is in gold. Shown in the figure also is the footprint (in magenta) of the 2C TCR CDR1 and CDR2 loops from both V and V domains derived from 2C TCR/H-2Kb structure (Garcia et al., 1996). (C) A side view of the 1 2 platform showing the hydrogen bond network in the TL groove. For clarity, 1 is colored in magenta, 2 in green, the floor sheet in yellow, and selected side chains in red ball-and-stick. The most prominent feature in the network is centered at the TL-specific Glu114 on the 5 strand, which forms hydrogen bonds to TLspecific residues. Also shown here are the three bound water molecules near where the peptide's termini would have been. (B) and (C) were prepared with MOLSCRIPT (Krulis, 1991).

TL(T18d) is incapable of presenting antigen for TCR recognition (Weber et al., 2002). There is no electron density between the two helical regions aside from several discrete densities assignable to water molecules positioned primarily where the N terminus of the antigenic peptide would reside in a classical peptide MHCI (pMHCI) structure. The Structure of the TL(T18d) Molecule The overall structure of TL(T18d) resembles a classical MHCI molecule. The heavy chain contains 1 and 2 domains that form a platform composed of a structurally conserved eight-stranded sheet on the bottom topped by two helical regions and an Ig-like 3 domain below the sheet (Figure 1). The 2M light chain is a conserved 99 residue Ig-like domain paired with the 3 domain. As mentioned above, compared to the murine MHCI molecule H-2Kb, TL(T18d) maintains the same configuration as its membrane proximal Ig-like domains, but has a substantially different arrangement of the 1 and 2 domains.

Within the 274 residue chain there are 82 substitutions in TL(T18d) relative to H-2Kb. Sixty-nine differences are found in the 180 residue 1 2 domain platform (62% identity) while only 13 reside in the 3 domain (86% identity). Importantly, there are no deletions or insertions of residues throughout (Teitell et al., 1994). Similar substitutions are evident in the other TL molecules, T3b, T3d, and T3a, with a single 3 residue deletion in the latter (Figure 3). As we shall discuss, these substitutions account for both the inability of TL to present antigen and its conversion into a stronger CD8 binding protein compared to the classical MHCIa molecule H-2Kb. The high sequence identity among TL molecules ( 92%, see Figure 3) indicates that the T18d structure should be representative of all TL proteins. Hence, hereafter we shall refer to T18d as TL. In this section, the large conformational changes in platform are described, whereas the more subtle changes in 3 domain that afford stronger CD8 binding will be discussed in the next section. The major structural changes in the platform resulting

Figure 3. Sequence Alignment of TL Family Members and H-2Kb Secondary structure elements are marked with broken lines. Those identical residues are colored in red, whereas conserved residues are in black and variant ones in blue, respectively. The sequences were from Chen et al. (1985), Mashimo et al. (1992), and Pontarotti et al. (1986).

from this sequence variation can be divided into two categories: alteration of secondary structure and modification of side chain distribution. The 8 stranded sheet that is conserved in all MHC molecules remains unchanged. However, the conformation of the loop linking strands 3 and 4 in TL has significantly changed because of sequence differences. The Gly40-Gly43 in TL forms a turn, curving up and in doing so, likely pushing the 1 helix toward the 2 helix (Figure 2B). The 1 helical region, like in H-2Kb, consists of a short 310 helix of Arg50-Glu55 and a long helix of Gly56Asn86. Interestingly for TL, the mid-portion of the long helix of 1 overwinds, thereby becoming a 310 helix, from Phe74 to Thr80. This energetically unfavorable long 310 helix is stabilized by the hydrogen bond between Trp147 on the 2 helix and the TL-specific Asn77 on the 1 helix (Figure 2C) and the aromatic ring clustering of Phe74 and TL-specific Phe73 on 1 as well as Trp147 and the TLspecific Tyr152 on 2 (Figure 2B), which help to close up the peptide binding groove. The 2 helical region in H-2Kb has a short helix of Asp137-Gln149 and a long helix of Gly151-Gly175 with a bend at the Gly162 (Figure 2B). In all MHCIa and MHCIb structures surveyed, this long helix kinks 90 at its C-terminal Gly175 and is followed by another short helix of Gly175-Arg181. By contrast, in TL a Gly175Arg substitution allows the long helix to extend one additional turn to Thr178 and then directly link to the 3 domain starting at Asp183 (Figure 2B). This 2 helix elongation has a net effect of changing the relative disposition between the platform and the

membrane proximal Ig-like domains 3 and 2M. In fact, a one-turn helical extension of the 2 region results in ° about a 2.5 A movement of the entire platform toward the 3 domain (Figure 4A), which allows for a TL-specific contact between the 2- 3 loop of the 1 domain and BC loop of the 3 domain. This in turn yields slight movement of the 2M toward the 3 domain, too, due to the extensive interactions between the 2M domain and the bottom of the platform. Another unique feature of the TL's 2 helical region is at the Pro163, one residue after the Gly162 bending point (Figure 2B). As the carbonyl group of Tyr159 cannot form a hydrogen bond to Pro163 in an helical conformation, it turns to the amide group of Cys164 instead, and so follows the Leu160-Lys165 pair. Apparently the short helix conformation unwinds the helical region, making the Gly162 bend sharper than that in H-2Kb and in a bending direction opposite to that of 1. Since the disulfide bond of Cys164-Cys101 fixes the C-terminal portion of 2 on the sheet platform, the overall consequence of the bend is to move the N-terminal portion of 2 toward the 1, further narrowing the groove. Compared to the H-2Kb structure, the largest ° C atom movements are 4.3 A for Arg75 of 1 and ° 2.6 A for Tyr152 of 2, respectively. The net result is to ° approximate the 1 and 2 helical regions about 7 A closer to each other than in the corresponding region of a class Ia molecule where the P6-P7 residues of an antigenic peptide would reside. Beyond the closer apposition of 1 and 2 helices in

In the figure prepared with MOLSCRIPT (Krulis, 1991), the TL structure is represented by thick colored lines with domains labeled in respective colors, while H-2Kb is represented by thin black lines. The two insets correspond to their respective boxed regions, highlighting detailed intermolecular interactions. The orientation differs from that in (A) to emphasize the detailed contacts. (Inset blue) Detailed intermolecular interactions between the AB and EF loops of TL and the DE loop of CD8 2. The color codes remain the same as in the superposition figure. (Inset green) Detailed intermolecular interactions between the BC and C'C" loops of CD8 1 and the CFG face of TL. (B) Comparison of MHC class I AB loop conformations. In HLA-A2 the AB loop points toward the reader, away from CD8 2, whereas in H-2Kb it flips inward and toward CD8 2. In the case of TL, the tip of the AB loop leans even further toward CD8 2.

TL, amino acid substitutions within the groove occupy the narrow intervening space. As shown in Figure 2B, the TL-specific Val67 and Phe73 from the 1 helix, the Tyr152 from the 2 helix, and the Tyr9 and Tyr99 from the sheet floor below, joined by conformationally readjusted residues, conserved Tyr7, Phe74, and Tyr159, fill up the groove. Hydrophobic interactions among these residues might provide the major energy to pull the two helical regions toward one another within direct contact. It is interesting to note from the superposition of TL and VSV8/H-2Kb shown in the Figure 2B that these hydrophobic residues evenly span the peptide binding footprint. Additionally, there are some hydrogen bond changes promoting this conformational transformation. The most prominent one is centered at the TL-specific Glu114 on the 5 strand. Glu114 forms three hydrogen bonds to His116, Tyr152, and Arg156, respectively, all of which

are TL-specific substitutions (Figure 2C). This network lies underneath the P6 pocket region and should have a significant facilitative effect in approximating the 1 helix with the 2 helix, on which the Tyr152 and Arg156 lie. An earlier study indicated that there are ten conserved antigen-binding site residues among 22 human MHCI sequences and 13 murine MHCIa sequences (Bjorkman et al., 1987). Three of those residues (Tyr7, Tyr59, and Tyr171) form a network of hydrogen bonds directly to the N terminus of the bound peptide and another three (Tyr84, Thr143, and Lys146) to the peptide's carboxyl group. In other words, most of these conserved residues define a sequence-independent peptide binding mode, a characteristic structural feature of class I MHC antigen presentation (Madden, 1995). Interestingly, these ten residues remain conserved in the seven known TL sequences (Obata et al., 1994). Our TL structure shows

Immunity 210

that bound water molecules are found in close proximity to where the peptide's N terminus would residue in an MHCIa structure. As shown in Figure 2C, a hydrogen bond network from one water molecule (labeled "O25" in the figure) to Tyr7, Tyr171, and Glu63 is formed. The bound waters in TL help maintain the conformation of these buried conserved tyrosines for structure integrity. The peptide's carboxyl terminus is relatively close to the molecular surface with its side chain deeply buried. In TL there is also another water molecule (labeled "O7") in association with the C-terminal anchoring pocket. This water forms a similar hydrogen bond network to conserved Thr143 and TL-specific Asn77 and Thr80. The side chains of the conserved Tyr84 and Lys146 are turned such that they become solvent exposed. Another interesting observation from the Figure 3 sequence alignment of known TL molecules is that while those residues that show mouse strain-specific sequence differences are essentially exposed, none are located on the top surface of TL. Hence, this allelic TL variation cannot be directly recognized by the TCR in a conventional manner. That TL-specific displacement of the 1 helix likely eliminates the TCR V CDR2 contact (Figure 2B) observed with the 2C TCR/H-2Kb interaction (Garcia et al., 1999) supports this notion. Alteration of residues on the platforms of TL versus H-2Kb where putative TCR contacts would be made is also striking. Those most important for TCR binding include (H-2Kb to TL) Glu61Ala, Gln65Asp, Lys66Ile, Arg79Asn, Lys89Asn, Leu141Asp, His145Ser, Arg155Leu, Trp167Ser, and Lys173Asp. The tendency is to have less featured surface, which will also significantly alter the immune recognition interface of TL. Structural Features of TL Enhancing CD8 Binding Collectively, the above findings indicate that substantial structural adaptations have occurred in the 1 and 2 domains of the TL molecules, eliminating antigen-presenting function. On the other hand, the 3 domain is more conserved between TL and H-2Kb (Obata et al., 1994) (Figure 3), suggesting that CD8 binding would be preserved. In fact, binding experiments with recombinant TL expressed in a baculovirus system demonstrate that the TL/CD8 affinity is significantly stronger than that of H-2Kb/CD8 , consistent with the ability of TL tetramers to specifically detect CD8 homodimers in flow cytometry experiments (Leishman et al., 2001). Functional conservation of the CD8 binding site in the TL 3 domain has been demonstrated by molecular chimeric analysis; CD8 can serve as a coreceptor for CTL recognition of a chimeric MHCIa molecule containing the TL 3 domain (Teitell et al., 1991). Nonetheless, differences in murine CD8 affinity for MHCIa H-2Kb and H-2Db are linked to small conformational changes in their respective 3 domains (Moody et al., 2001). We are now in the position to directly compare the structures of the murine TL/CD8 complex to the murine H-2Kb/CD8 complex (Kern et al., 1998), exploring the basis of affinity variation. We have noticed that the CD8 homodimer somewhat more closely approximates the 3 domain in the TL/CD8 complex than in the H-2Kb/CD8 complex. The distance between mass ° centers of the TL 3 domain and CD8 is 0.35 A shorter

than the distance between the H-2Kb 3 domain and CD8 . This result indicates the overall proximity of TL versus H-2Kb in CD8 binding, which will be discussed in detail below. The major CD8 binding region resides on the CD loop of the 3 domain for both human and mouse MHC molecules, encompassing residues 219-228 (Gao et al., 1997; Kern et al., 1998). Within this segment, the only TL versus H-2Kb substitution observed for most TL molecules is the Met228Thr (Figure 3). The side chain of Thr228 is not directly engaged in CD8 binding. Instead, its hydroxyl group hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Leu224. This increases the number of hydrogen bonds within the CD loop (Kern et al., 1998), making the loop of TL more rigid. It can be envisioned that a rigidified CD loop favors CD8 binding from an entropic point of view. Most of the intermolecular contacts detailed previously between CD8 and H-2Kb (Kern et al., 1998) are conserved in the TL/CD8 complex. An exception is the loss of one hydrogen bond between the H-2Kb 3 domain's Lys198-NZ and the carbonyl group of CD8 1 Ser59, due to the Lys198Asp substitution in TL. However, TL gains one hydrogen bond between the Arg194 NH1 and the carbonyl group of Asn61 in the nearby region (Figure 4A, inset blue). Arg194, a residue conserved in TL and H-2Kb, readjusts its side chain to form this additional hydrogen bond, afforded by the closer proximity of the TL/CD8 interaction. Elsewhere, in TL/ CD8 relative to H-2Kb/CD8 , more intermolecular contacts are observed, in particular near the bottom of the complex (Figure 4A, inset blue) between the DE loop of the CD8 2 subunit and the TL molecule's AB and EF complex loops. In comparing the murine H-2Kb/CD8 to the human HLA-A2/CD8 complex, we noticed earlier that the AB loop of the murine H-2Kb 3 domain has a different conformation from the corresponding loop in human HLA-A2 (Kern et al., 1998), bending toward CD8 2 and contributing more binding energy. In HLAA2, the A and B strands form a 10 residue-long antiparallel structure up to and including the His192-Thr200 pair, followed by a bulge at Ala193 and Val194 (Figure 4B, left panel). The AB loop is a normal turn of Ser195Glu198, pointing away from CD8 with no contacts. In H-2Kb, probably due to the Ser195Pro substitution, the A-B strand pairing extends two more residues to Arg194-Lys198, leaving Pro195-Glu196-Asp197 as an irregular loop and bending toward the CD8 2 subunit for contacts (Figure 4B, middle panel). The TL 3 domain has a similar AB loop conformation as in that of H-2Kb but with a slightly different internal hydrogen bond pattern (Figure 4B, right panel). The Glu197Gly substitution in TL permits residue 197 to assume the otherwise disallowed dihedral conformation of 156 and  96. Its carbonyl group no longer forms a hydrogen bond to the neighboring D strand like that in H-2Kb, but instead turns to hydrogen bond to the side chain of Arg194 within the AB loop. This brings the AB loop even closer to the CD8 2 subunit. Since the E strand pairs with the B strand all the way up to residue Ser251 at the beginning of the DE loop, it also brings the DE loop closer to CD8. The overall consequence of the closer abutment in this region is that there are six pairs of hydrophobic contacts and one hydrogen bond between the TL molecule's AB

TL/CD8 211

Interaction

and EF loops and the CD8 2 DE loop, whereas there are only two hydrophobic contacts and two hydrogen bonds between the corresponding regions of H-2Kb/ CD8 complex. The comparison is manifest from Figure 4A, inset blue. In an analogous fashion, the interaction between TL and CD8 1 is also further "reinforced" (Figure 4A, inset green). For instance, Gln34 of the CD8 1 subunit BC ° loop makes two hydrogen bonds (both longer than 3.2 A) to the Leu215-NH and Thr216 side chain, respectively, on the C strand of H-2Kb 3 domain, whereas the same Gln34 of the CD8 1 subunit appears to make two hydrogen bonds to the Leu215 backbone groups with notice° ably shorter distance (both shorter than 2.8 A) on TL. There are also more hydrophobic contacts in the TL/ CD8 1 interaction as clearly shown in Figure 4A, inset green. Another unique interaction in murine H-2Kb/ CD8 complex is between the N terminus of CD8 1 and H-2Kb (Kern et al., 1998). By comparison, the N terminus of TL curves away from 2M and toward the 3 domain, creating a different set of interactions with CD8 1, while the number of interactions does not change. For example, the carbonyl group of CD8 1 Lys1 makes a hydrogen bond to the side chain of the 2M domain in H-2Kb. In TL, this same Lys1 residue uses its side chain to hydrogen bond to Glu229 of the TL 2 domain; also Arg8 of CD8 1 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Lys58 of 2M in H-2Kb, but a salt bridge to Asp122 of the TL 2 domain. This is actually an intricate area, where CD8 1 meets both heavy and light chains of MHCI molecule. A Leu29Ala mutation in CD8 , for instance, substantially reduces H-2Kb binding, but has no effect for TL binding (Devine et al., 2002). For CD8 1, this Leu29 points to the tip of DE loop of 2M, in a quite crowded environment. In the H-2Kb complex, the Lys58 from the 2M DE loop forms a salt bridge to Glu27 of CD8 1, and the nearby Leu29 apparently participates to stabilize the interaction, which may explain why the CD8 Leu29Ala mutation is impairing. On the other hand, in the TL complex the side chain of Lys58 swings away from CD8 1 Glu27, so the same mutation of Leu29Ala may not have such an effect. Given the similar general features of the two MHCI/ CD8 interfaces, the structural differences are quite small. Nonetheless, the binding affinity difference in the receptor-ligand interaction results from exquisite conformational changes between the TL/CD8 versus pairs. From the sequence alignment H-2Kb/CD8 shown in Figure 3, it is obvious that all of the abovementioned T18d residues associated with the stronger CD8 binding are conserved among TL molecules. Predictably, those other TL molecules should manifest higher CD8 binding affinity than H-2Kb. Structural Comparison of Nonclassical MHC Molecules and Implications for Coreceptor Binding There have been multiple crystal structures of nonclassical MHCIb and MHCI-like molecules available, including neonatal human Fc receptor (FcRn) (Burmeister et al., 1994), murine H2-M3 (Wang et al., 1995), mouse CD1d (Zeng et al., 1997) and human CD1b (Gadola et al., 2002), human hemochromatosis protein HFE (Lebron et al., 1998), human MIC-A (Li et al., 1999), human Zn- 2-gly-

coprotein (ZAG) (Sanchez et al., 1999), murine T22 (Wingren et al., 2000), and murine Qa-2 (He et al., 2001). Their diversity is striking: the widely opened classical MHCIa antigenic peptide binding groove of H-2Kb, the specialized peptide binding groove of Qa-2 and H2-M3, the slightly narrowed but much deepened antigenic lipid binding groove in CD1 molecules, the very narrowed groove in HFE, and closed grooves in TL and FcRn. There are additional examples of structural diversity among the molecules. For example, T22 displays a truncated 2 helix at its N-terminal half (Wingren et al., 2000), while ZAG and MIC-A do not associate with a 2M light chain (Li et al., 1999; Sanchez et al., 1999). The degree of structural deviation of these molecules from classical MHCIa molecules matches with their evolutionary phylogeny. Using an 3 domain sequence alignment to construct a phylogenetic tree, the nonclassical MHCIb molecules with the exception of FcRn are closer to MHCIa, whereas the FcRn and CD1 family are closer to MHC class II (MHCII) molecules (Kulski et al., 2001). The majority of these MHCI-like molecules still play roles in immune responsiveness. A few perform unrelated functions, however, such as HFE, which binds to the transferrin receptor and regulates iron homeostasis (Feder et al., 1998). Class Ia and class II MHC molecules are known to bind CD8 and CD4 coreceptors selectively, with CD8 mainly contacting the MHCIa 3 domain CD loop (Gao et al., 1997; Kern et al., 1998) and CD4 "inserting" into the junction between two membrane proximal Ig-like domains (Wang et al., 2001). Several of the aforementioned class Ib molecules also interact exclusively with CD8 but others, such as HFE, do not interact with CD8 at all. While TL has a stronger affinity for CD8 than its classical MHCIa H-2Kb counterpart, another MHCIb molecule, murine Qa-2, has a much weaker affinity (Teitell et al., 1993), also associated with the characteristic AB loop conformation of its 3 domain (He et al., 2001). T22 is a T cell receptor ligand that apparently does not present antigens (Crowley et al., 1997). At least one of the proposed TCR binding sites (Pro124) on T22 may prevent any coreceptor engagement since it lies very close to the T22 3 domain (Wingren et al., 2000). The ZAG-related MHCIb MIC-A molecule is unlikely to associate with the CD8 coreceptor due to its unusual 3 domain and variant CD loop (Sanchez et al., 1999). Moreover, since both ZAG and MIC-A do not associate with 2M, which contributes significantly to the CD8 interaction surface, they most likely will not ligate CD8 efficiently, if at all. TL/CD8 Interaction as a Modulator of the TCR/CD8 /pMHCIa Signaling Complex Both the inability of TL to bind antigenic ligands and the narrow interhelical TL geometry, unfavorable to TCR binding, imply that TL cannot participate in cognate TCR recognition functions. Consistent with this notion is the observation that TL transgenic mice expressing T18d under control of the H-2Dd promoter fail to foster CD8 T lineage development when crossed onto a Tap / background (H.C. and M.K., unpublished data). At the same time, presentation of a stronger CD8 binding site with preference for CD8 over CD8 favors ligation

of CD8 with TL, rather than with MHCIa molecules. As a consequence, CD8 that can be coexpressed together with a conventional coreceptor will preferentially interact with TL while the coreceptor CD4 or CD8 ligates with the MHC involved in the TCR activation complex. In this view, the TL/CD8 interaction disrupts the potential coreceptor function of CD8 , diverting CD8 from participation with the TCR in bidentate binding to the same MHCIa molecule. Recently it was shown that such specific interaction of CD8 constitutively expressed by the activated IEL with TL constitutively expressed by intestinal epithelial cells significantly modifies TCR activation signals (Leishman et al., 2001). CD8 expression is not unique to IEL and its expression can be induced upon activation of conventional T cells as well. Similarly, TL can be induced upon dendritic cell activation and it is thus feasible that the interaction of activation-induced CD8 and TL molecules modifies activation signals that might determine the fate of the stimulated effector T cells. The CD8 chain harbors the signaling component of the CD8 coreceptor molecule, by binding the active tyrosine kinase p56lck (Molina et al., 1992; Straus and Weiss, 1992; Turner et al., 1990; Yao et al., 1990). It is the CD8 chain, however, that permits translocation of the CD8 coreceptor to lipid rafts bringing the CD8 -associated lck in close proximity to the raft-associated TCR activation complexes (Arcaro et al., 2001). This translocation event is required for efficient induction of downstream signaling cascades and T cell activation. When interacting with TL, CD8 is largely excluded from these activation complexes,

thus sequestering the CD8 -associated lck away from the TCR and possibly redirecting the kinase to other immune receptors. It is conceivable that shifts in the responsiveness of effector T cells, for example from IL-2 to IL-15 dependency, or the upregulation of survival factors such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL observed in memory CD8 T cells (Ku et al., 2000; Lodolce et al., 1998; Suzuki et al., 1997), are predicated on this signaling component compartmentalization. In this way, TL/CD8 -mediated attenuation of TCR ligation may prevent activationinduced cell death while selectively stimulating survival pathways for memory T cell precursors. Such TL/CD8 interaction appears to promote the survival of constitutively activated IEL (Leishman et al., 2001). This view is consistent with the observations described in a recent study by Konno et al. (2002) in which human CD8 T cells were identified that expressed a typical memory phenotype. The latter finding further indicates that the CD8 -mediated process of memory formation is conserved across species.
Experimental Procedures Production and Purification of CD8 and TL The N-terminal extracellular fragment of murine CD8 chains (residues 1­122), with leucine-zipper-forming acidic or basic segments at carboxyl-terminal, respectively (resulting in a homodimer formation), was expressed in and purified from Lec3.2.8.1 cells by 2H11affinity chromatography. The leucine zipper was cleaved by thrombin and the deglycosylation was performed by Endo-H treatment as described previously (Kern et al., 1998). The CD8 protein was further purified by gel-filtration on a Superdex 75 column and buffer exchanged to 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) and 0.025% sodium azide.

TL/CD8 213

Interaction

The cDNA of murine T18d heavy chain (encoding the residues 1­274) was inserted into the expression vector pET-23b and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The inclusion bodies were purified and dissolved in guanidine-HCl solution (1.1g/ml of guanidine HCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). The denatured heavy chain (TL) and human light chain ( 2m) inclusion bodies were added each to 5 ml of 3 M guanidine-HCl, 10 mM sodium acetate, and 10 mM EDTA (pH 4.2). An efficient refolding was achieved by rapidly diluting the inclusion bodies into 1 liter cold refolding buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 400 mM L-arginine, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, and 0.2 mM PMSF) with vigorous stirring. The final concentrations of the heavy and light chains were 1 and 2 M, respectively. After the refolding solution was incubated at 10 C with slow stirring overnight, the second and third batches of inclusion bodies were added in every 6­12 hr, and a further overnight incubation was performed. The refolded material was then concentrated to 10 ml and sized on a Sephacryl S-300 Hi-Prep column (HR 26/60), followed by ion exchange on a Mono-Q column using a NaCl gradient elution. Subsequently, the purified TL protein was buffer exchanged to 10 mM HEPES. Crystallization and Data Collection The TL/CD8 complex was crystallized using the hanging-droplet vapor diffusion method. The T18d and CD8 homodimer were mixed in an equal molar ratio to the final protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. 1 l protein solution was mixed with 1 l crystallization buffer containing 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 2.0% polyethylene 400, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.5). Including DMSO was a key to converting polycrystals into large single crystals. The co-crystals belong to space group P3212 with cell parameters ° ° a b 83.8 A and c 178.8 A. There is only one complex in the asymmetric unit. Originally the crystals diffracted very anisotropi° cally with the best direction to 3.5 A and the worst direction only ° ° to around 6 A. A 4.5 A data set was first collected at room temperature from a single crystal mounted in a capillary tube using a MAR Research image plate area detector with the Rigaku RU300 RC rotating anode X-ray generator. The crystals were soaked in a buffer for dehydration treatment and cryo-protection. The treatment buffer contains 2.3 M ammonium sulfate, 0.3 M sodium citrate, and 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5). The treatment causes the unit cell to shrink to a ° ° b 77.0 A, c 176.1 A with the same space group, and the tighter packing dramatically improved the crystal quality. A detailed report ° about the treatment will be published elsewhere. Good quality 2.1 A resolution data were collected under -160 C using a single prefrozen, dehydration-treated crystal at the SBC-CAT 19ID beamline of the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratories. All the data were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Structure Determination and Refinement The structure was initially determined using the molecular replacement method implemented in the program package CNS (Brunger ° et al., 1998) with the 50.0­4.85 A data collected at room temperature. ° complex derived from the 2.8 A crystal The entire H-2Kb/CD8 structure was used as a search model (PDB code 1bqh) (Kern et al., 1998). Those residues that differ between H-2Kb and T18d were replaced before calculation. The solution was relatively straightforward. The model was then divided into five parts for subsequent rigid body refinement with CNS: the 1 2 platform, 3, 2M, CD8 1, and CD8 2 domains. At this stage, the platform's substantial conformational changes were already observed and the electron density maps clearly showed a closed groove between the two ° helical regions. The 2.1 A data set was then available for further refinement, and the model was subjected to simulated annealing, energy minimization, B factor refinement, and water-inclusion using CNS. The refinement was alternated by manual model rebuilding using O (Jones et al., 1991) based on calculated difference Fourier maps. After the simulated annealing procedure, the (2Fo-Fc) map for all of the secondary structures were well defined except for the 4 strand of the platform and the carboxyl end of the 2 helix. The final model fits the electron density map very well with good geometry. The model includes the entire 274 residues of TL, residues

1­120 of the CD8 1 subunit, residues 4­125 of the CD8 2 subunit, and 164 water molecules. No meaningful electron densities were found for the N-terminal three residues of the CD8 2 subunit, and the C-terminal five residues of the CD8 1 subunit. The densities for residues Ile17, Ser18, and Glu19 in the 1 2 loop of the TL molecule were also poor; these surface exposed residues have nevertheless been tentatively modeled. ° To verify that the 2.1 A structure does not have significant deformation caused by the dehydration treatment, the refined structure was back subjected to five rounds of rigid body refinement against ° the 4.5 A resolution data collected at room temperature without such treatment. The RMSD value for all C atoms between the input ° and output models was only 0.54 A. This result clearly indicates that the dehydration treatment has little effect on domain arrangement. Rather, the treatment induces much tighter molecular packing than that before treatment. This is manifest in the unit cell dimension difference that gives the treated crystal about 17% reduction in volume (Table 1).
