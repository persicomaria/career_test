Subtle modulation of antibody-binding properties by protein engineering often lies with an accurate structural and energetic description of how an antigen is recognised. Thus, with the intent to increase the af®nity and add a bias in favour of natural estradiol compared with its chemically modi®ed immunogen, we have determined the crystal structure of two anti-estradiol monoclonal antibodies, 10G6D6 and 17E12E5. Although generated against the same estradiol derivative, these antibodies share little sequence identity, which is re¯ected in dissimilar binding pockets and in different positioning of the steroid. In both antibodies the characteristic 17-hydroxyl group is buried deeply at the bottom of hydrophobic pockets and stabilised by hydrogen bonds. Apart from this similarity, the steroid is oriented differently in the respective binding pockets. The high speci®city of both antibodies has been mapped out, and even closely related steroids show low cross-reactivity. The structural studies of the complex formed between 10G6D6 and 6-CMO-estradiol have identi®ed contacts between the 6-CMO coupling linker and an arginine residue from the heavy chain CDR2 segment. This segment is now being targeted by random mutagenesis to select mutants with a preference for natural estradiol compared to the branched hapten.

Introduction
Accurate diagnosis and effective cancer or viral therapies require highly speci®c antibodies directed against proteins or haptens.1,2 Among haptens, steroids are favourite targets, as they characterise distinct physiological and pathological states and are present widely in biological samples. For such analyses, anti-steroid antibodies that combine high selectivity and af®nity are required. Unfortunately, steroids form a large family of small hydrophobic molecules, chemically and

structurally related to each other, and thus present a problem for their recognition. Being small, they need to be linked to a macromolecule during immunisation, a situation that may produce a ``bridge-effect'' where the chemical linker becomes part of the recognised epitope, or even worse distorts the structure of the hapten, resulting in a suboptimal recognition of the natural molecule as compared to the chemically modi®ed one. Several crystallographic studies have helped in our understanding of these issues, particularly cross-reactivity in the case of anti-steroid antibodies. This is well exempli®ed by the anti-progesterone antibody DB3 that was studied in complex with progesterone (Kd 1 nM) and four cross-reactive steroids that bind with high af®nity (Kd 0.4 nM to 21 nM).3 ± 5 Structurally, these steroids form two distinct groups that use overlapping but alternative binding pockets. The speci®city of DB3 rests on its capacity to establish conserved

The three-dimensional structures of two antidigoxin antibodies generated independently of each other6,7 show highly speci®c recognition of particular conformations, of digoxin by 26-10 and of ouabain by 40-50, using different side-chains in unrelated orientations. The haptens adopt different orientations but share a common characteristic: the lactone rings dominate the interaction, with overall strong shape complementarity. Antibody fragment Fv4155 discriminates between two closely related steroid glucuronides with af®nities that differ by an order of magnitude (estriol Kd 10 nM and estrone Kd 100 nM).8 The difference in binding af®nity is accounted by a different hydrogen-bond geometry and subtle changes in solvation. 10G6D6 and 17E12E5, presented here, are two murine monoclonal antibodies that resulted from the same immunisation against 17b-estradiol conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) at position 6 through an ethoxy-methyl-carboxylate (EMC) linker (Figure 1, compound 16). Here, we will abbreviate the names of these antibodies to 10G6 and 17E12. Biosensor assays using estradiol-6-CMOalkaline phosphatase as a conjugate established that 10G6 and 17E12 exhibit similar high af®nity with deduced dissociation constants of 1.0 nM and 10 nM, respectively. Furthermore, cross-reactivity measurements revealed a high recognition speci®city. However, in immunoassay, 10G6 and 17E12 disfavour the natural 17b-estradiol compared to the conjugated one, suggesting a ``bridge-effect''. A combination of molecular modelling and sitedirected mutagenesis was implemented to predict how 17E12 and 10G6 bind to estradiol.9 To further improve the quality of the structural information, we embarked on the determination of the crystal structures of 17E12 and 10G6 free and complexed. We present here the structures of FabH 17E12 alone and complexed with the 17b-estradiol and of FabH 10G6 alone and complexed with 17b-estradiol-6carboxyl-methyl-oxime (6CMO) (Figure 1, compounds 1 and 2). The crystal structure of the two binding pockets, complemented with the mutagenesis and cross-reactivity data has revived the engineering project. In particular, the proximity of an arginine residue from the hypervariable loop 2H of 10G6 to the chemical 6-CMO linker has re-focussed the project on a previously ignored stretch of amino acid residues that might lead to variants with preferential af®nity for natural 17b-estradiol.

branched hapten; a goal that must be reached without loss of their original high level of speci®city. A semi-rational strategy was preferred to a merely random one. The project consisted of two stages. The ®rst was the identi®cation and mutation of segments predicted to be in the vicinity of the 6-CMO chemical linker by combining modelling and site-directed mutagenesis. The predictions provided initial models on which to base the engineering of the two antibodies.9 With hindsight, the accuracy of the constructed models was not suf®cient, so our ®rst attempts did not yield the results that were hoped for (unpublished data). The second, slower stage, consisted of the X-ray crystallographic studies of free and complexed FabH fragments of 17E12 and 10G6. Now, with the availability of the X-ray crystallographic structures, we are able to assess the modelling results and modify our engineering targets.

Overview of the structures of the free and complexed antibodies Conformation of the hypervariable loops Both antibodies were crystallised free and complexed. Antibody 10G6 was crystallised in complex with 17b-estradiol-6CMO and 17E12 complexed to 17b-estradiol (Figure 1, compounds 1 and 2). The hypervariable loops are well de®ned in the electron density, as is the rest of the variable regions of both antibodies in the free and complexed strucÊ tures. The data for 10G6 extends to 2.7 A and most phi-psi angles are as expected for this resolution. The hypervariable loops L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2 follow the standard conformations tabulated for canonical structures10 (Table 1). The 15 amino acid residues long hypervariable loop H3 of 10G6 is in a bulged torso conformation11 from H92 to H95 and from H100a to H104; the ®ve residue stretch from H96 to H100 is in an extended conformation. This loop has a weak resemblance to the equivalent loop in catalytic antibody 1E9 (PDB 1C1E; rmsd Ê 1.9 A) that also has an H3 loop of the same length and with which it shares 53 % sequence identity, the closest structure in the PDB. For FabH 17E12, the phi-psi angles are less accuÊ rate due to the lower 3.0 A resolution. Loops L1 to H2 of this antibody conform to canonical structures (Table 1). The H3 loop presents two unusual features: it is among the shortest, having only ten amino acid residues between CysH92 and GlyH10412 with a rarely observed proline residue at position H102 just before the conserved residues TrpH103 and GlyH104.11 The torso part of the H3 loop presents a conformation different from the classical bulged or non-bulged loops reported to date.11 Better-diffracting crystals of this or another antibody with a similar H3 sequence would help to de®ne this new torso structure more precisely.

Results
The results of the crystallographic study described here are part of an antibody engineering project undertaken to improve the af®nity and recognition speci®city of two monoclonal antibodies (17E12 and 10G6) so that they should show a preference for natural estradiol compared to the

Numbering of atoms is shown on the structure of the 17b-estradiol. Cross-reactivity experiments were made with compounds 1 to 15. The antibodies were generated against 17b-estradiol-6EMC (16).

FabH 10G6-Estradiol-6CMO complex The asymmetric unit of the estradiol-6CMO-FabH 10G6 complex contains four molecules. Molecules 1 and 4 are related by an approximate non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, as are the constant domains of all other molecules. However, the same relation-

ship is not true for the variable domains of the other molecules, which deviate by up to 3  . The framework regions of the four antibodies were restrained during the crystallographic re®nement, which allows for some slight rearrangements among the four complexes. In the ®rst omit maps Ê calculated at 2.85 A resolution, the estradiol-6CMO

could ®t in two different orientations. They differed in the position of the 6CMO linker and the estradiol A and B rings. Re®nements conducted in parallel allowed us to discriminate between the two possibilities. A drop of 0.5 % in the Rfree value clearly favoured one position compared to the other, this choice is also evident in the electron density maps (Figure 2(a)). The interaction is mediated by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts as given in Table 2. Three distinct regions of the steroid are involved: (i) rings C and D, and the hydroxyl group at position 17; (ii) rings A and B, and the hydroxyl group at position 3; and (iii) the carboxyl-methyl oxime (CMO) linker attached at position 6. The two rings C and D stack against TrpH33, LeuH98 and TrpH47 (Figure 3(a)). The methyl group in C18 comes in contact with LeuH98 and PheL96. The hydroxyl group at position 17 is within hydrogen bond distance of the side-chains of GlnH35 and ThrH100a. Rings A and B stack mainly against TrpL91 and AsnL94 from L3 and the alkyl chain of

ArgH58. The upper part of these rings (atoms C4 to C9) is the least buried part of the steroid, as expected from the structure of the immunogen, consisting of a hapten linked to BSA at position C6 via an EMC moiety. The CMO, used in the crystal structure, protrudes to the outside of the combining site, making only a small contribution to the binding, so small that the position of the linker is poorly de®ned in two of the four molecules. In the other two, the side-chain NZ2 atom of ArgH58 is within distance for a weak hydrogen bond from Ê Ê the CMO-O19 (3.4 A) or O20 (3.6 A). Although the contribution of the linker may be small, it is nonetheless important, since the 6CMO linker is used in the diagnostic test.9 The 6CMO moiety differs from the 6EMC linker used in the immunogen (Figure 1, compounds 2 and 16): CMO oxime (-N-O-) is longer than EMC ethoxy (-O-). This may in¯uence the different manner in which the side-chain of ArgH58, and in particular its polar atoms, may contact the CMO moiety compared to EMC.

FabH 17E12-estradiol complex The electron density map for the 17b-estradiolFabH 17E12 complex shows the presence of the 17b-estradiol in the combining site (Figure 2(b)). However, due to the moderate resolution of the data, the electron density map does not allow the identi®cation of a unique conformation of the 17bestradiol moiety. The cross-reactivity results (Table 3), play an important role in removing most of the ambiguity. Slight modi®cations on the D ring disrupt the estradiol binding (see below), consistent with the 17b-estradiol adopting a position where the hydroxyl group at position 17 and the rings C and D are buried at the bottom of the combining site. The data for the glucuronide groups at positions O3 or O17 help to de®ne the cavities that must exist around these positions. The fact that 17glucuronide-estradiol derivative (Figure 1, compound 7) abrogates binding, while the glucuronide at position 3 (Figure 1, compound 8) does not affect binding, allows us to orient the steroid axis and places the 17 hydroxyl group at the bottom of the pocket. This leaves two possible orientations but only one of these allows the formation of both

hydrogen bonds, those between the 17 hydroxyl group and TyrL36 and HisL89. Consequently, the hydrogen bonds and the contacts established by the steroid with FabH 17E12 remain somewhat ambiguous, given the resolution (Table 4). Two principal regions characterise the interaction between the estradiol and the antibody: (i) rings C and D, and the hydroxyl group at position 17; (ii) rings A and B, and the hydroxyl group at position 3. As for 10G6, rings C and D are the most buried, stabilised mainly by stacking against PheL91 and PheH35 (Figure 3(b)). PheH35 is rare in mouse VH genes, as the residue at position 35 is most often His or Gln. Ring C interacts with the apex region of the H3 loop where the methyl group at position 18 comes into contact with main-chain atoms from three of the residues located on this loop. The hydroxyl group at position 17 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the side-chains of TyrL36 and HisL89. As was observed for FabH 10G6, rings A and B are the less buried, with the upper part of these rings (atoms C4 to C9) making fewer contacts with the antibody pocket, strengthening the idea that the immunogen has a strong in¯uence in

shaping the combining site structurally and energetically. Rings A and B are stabilised mainly by TyrL49, a dominant residue involved in two-thirds of the contacts realised by the FabH with these rings. Similarities and differences between FabH 10G6 and 17E12 binding modes Overall orientation and position of the estradiol Although antibodies 10G6 and 17E12 were generated against the same immunogen, estradiol6EMC (Figure 1), cloning and sequencing of their Fab fragments have shown that these use different genes. There is only 55 % sequence identity in the variable regions of the heavy chains of 10G6 and 17E12; although both belong to the g1 class, the variable domains are from the VIII and IX gene families, respectively. The 38.5 % identity in the variable sequences of the light chains of 10G6 and 17E12 is not surprising, since these belong to the l

and k families, respectively. Hence, some large differences in their mode of binding were expected. In both structures, the estradiol is buried deeply in the combining site. In 10G6, the estradiol-6CMO Ê buries 70 % of its surface (403 A2 buried out of Ê 2 of accessible surface), 87 % of this surface 580 A corresponds to the estradiol portion of the hapten. This is similar to the 85 % buried by the free estraÊ Ê diol in 17E12 (385 A2 buried out of 450 A}2 of accessible surface). The steroid adopts a similar overall orientation in both antibodies, with ring D being the most buried, and ring A the least. In this way, the hydroxyl group at the C3 position of ring A is exposed to the solvent at the top of the combining site, while the hydroxyl function at position C17 on ring D is buried at the bottom of the combining site. The estradiol orientation is likely to be the result of the attachment of the steroid to its carrier protein, BSA, at position C6 on ring B though the 6EMC linker (Figure 1, compound 16).

plexed structures, including the third hypervariable loops of both heavy chains, suggesting that no signi®cant conformational change occurs during binding in either antibody (Table 1). Speci®cally, loop H3 of FabH 10G6 has a similar conformation in Ê both free and complexed states (rmsd 0.12 A for main-chain atoms for the most exposed part of the loop, from ArgH96 to TyrH100). The lack of conformational changes may be thought unusual. In the case of 17E12 it could be due to the fact that the estradiol was introduced by soaking, and hence lattice forces could have hindered a conformational change. Such an argument cannot be made for 10G6, where co-crystallisation promotes a different crystal form, suggesting that whatever minor conformational changes are induced by the binding of the steroid they have a profound in¯uence on the crystal contacts. Co-crystals of the estradiol complex of 17E12 can be grown; they are morphologically similar, although of poorer quality, suggesting that in the case of 17E12 there are really no signi®cant changes. The most likely reason for the lack of major conformational change may lie in the presence of an additional electron density in the middle of the combining site of both steroid-free antibodies. The size and height of the electron density could be attributed to a cluster of water molecules or, more likely, to the relatively hydrophobic buffers used in the preparation: Ches for FabH 17E12 and TEA for FabH 10G6. The shape of the density would favour the latter hypothesis. Hence, the structures that we refer to as ``free'' are free of steroid, but are not free structures in the strictest sense. Whatever the nature of these components of the solvent, their presence might explain the weak deviation between the free and complexed combining sites and suggest that an open hydrophobic binding site favours non-speci®c binding. These antibodies do not have a mechanism like that in FabH DB3,3,4 where in the free structure TrpH100 acts as a pseudo ligand and closes the entrance to the hydrophobic binding site. Cross-reactivity studies

Comparison between free antibody and steroid-complexes Superposition of the whole Fv regions between the free and complexed structures shows no major conformational change in the polypeptide chain as Ê a result of ligand binding (rmsd of 0.42 A for FabH Ê 17E12 and 0.43 A for FabH 10G6 for 890 main-chain atoms). Some minor differences are observed in loop L3 of FabH 10G6, which makes contact with Ê the hapten (rmsd 0.66 A for main-chain atoms; Table 1) but, given the limited resolution of the complex structure, one could not assign such minor differences to an induced-®t mechanism. Otherwise, in both antibodies, the hypervariable loops superimpose well between the free and com-

Cross-reactivity studies have been carried out for 10G6 and 17E12 with 14 estradiol derivatives. Results for 11 have been reported.9 Three additional compounds (Figure 1, compounds 9, 10 and 12) were tested later to better understand the relative binding activities of these steroids in light of the two antibody-steroid complex crystal structures. A theoretical model of the structure of the free steroid derivatives was constructed with the program TURBO13 on the basis of crystallographic structures.8,15 Derivatives (Figure 1, compounds 5, 6, 13-15) models were constructed with the program CSchem 3Dpro. All the derivatives were superimposed on the estradiol, minimising the Ê deviation over the 17 carbon atoms (rmsd 0.12 AÊ 0.7 A; Table 3). The relative binding activities for the different derivatives and the main features deduced from the superimposition of these com-

707 than that of natural estradiol. However, modelling of the CMO linker in 17E12 indicates neither stabilisation nor steric hindrance with residues of the FabH surrounding the 6 position. In conclusion, most cross-reactivity measurements indicate that, for both antibodies, it is necessary to maintain the hydrogen bonds formed by the 17-hydroxyl group and that a major contribution to the binding is achieved through the stabilisation of this hydroxyl group within a hydrophobic region.

pounds in the combining sites of both antibodies are given in Table 3. Cross-reactivity between estradiol derivatives for antibody 10G6 Deletion of the 17-hydroxyl group (as in 17-desoxy and 16-estratetraen) or its substitution by a carbonyl (estrone) group are suf®cient to disrupt steroid recognition (Table 3). This underscores the dominant role played by the hydrogen bonds made by the 17-hydroxyl group with the sidechains of GlnH35 and ThrH100a in a rather hydrophobic environment at bottom of the combining site. The relative position of the hydroxyl group and the carbon atom at position 17 on the steroid b face is a characteristic of the 17b-estradiol. Positioning the 17-hydroxyl group on the other face, as in the 17a-estradiol, disrupts at least one of the hydrogen bonds and leaves a poorly stabilised polar group in a hydrophobic environment. The additions of a glucuronide at positions 3 or 17 have radically different effects. At position 17, major steric hindrance would break major interactions while at position 3, it may enhance binding through additional interactions of the sugar hydroxyl group with surrounding residues.16 Five derivatives with a supplementary hydroxyl group at position 16 (estriol), 2, 4, 6a and 11b were analysed. Hydroxyl groups at positions 16 and 11b are disruptive, as in the structure of 10G6 these hydrophilic groups would be unable to form supplementary hydrogen bonds and would ®nd themselves in a hydrophobic environment next to TrpH33 for estriol (hydroxyl group at position 16) and TrpH47 and TrpL91 for the 11b-hydroxy derivative. On the other hand, 2-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy groups could be stabilised through additional hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl group of AsnL94 and with the guanidinium group of ArgH58, respectively. The binding activities measured for these compounds are not better, implying that such stabilisation is insuf®cient. Cross-reactivity between estradiol derivatives for antibody 17E12 Most observations made for 10G6 apply to 17E12, though the estradiol is located in a completely different structural environment. All modi®cations of the 17-hydroxyl group result in loss of af®nity, whatever the nature of the change (estriol, estrone, 17-desoxy, or 17a-estradiol). This is consistent with critical interactions made by the 17-hydroxyl group at the bottom of the cavity. The 17-glucuronide derivative results are also similar. However, addition of hydroxyl groups at other positions has a different effect from that observed for 10G6. In particular, a 2-hydroxyl group would prevent recognition by disrupting the stacking of the phenyl ring of TyrL49 against ring A, introducing a polar group in an hydrophobic environment. The binding of estradiol-6CMO is weaker

Discussion
Structural diversity in the immune response against estradiol It is noteworthy that 10G6 and 17E12 share similar structural and energetic characteristics although they belong to two distinct families of anti-steroid antibodies with two structurally unrelated combining sites (Figure 4). In FabH 17E12, the cavity occupied by the estradiol is at the apex of the short H3 hypervariable stretch. In 10G6, the H3 loop is ®ve amino acid residues longer than in 17E12, and extends to occupy the site that in 17E12 is occupied by the estradiol. The binding cavity in 17E12 is generated partly by its unusually short H3 loop. Other anti-steroid antibodies whose crystallographic structure has been determined have an H3 loop of standard length. In the DB3-progesterone complex,3,4 the relative position of the steroid is close to that found in 10G6 after superimposition Ê of both antibody variable regions (rmsd of 1.34 A

The estradiols are in ball-and-stick representations and are coloured in light green for 17bestradiol in FabH 17E12 and dark green for 17b-estradiol6CMO in FabH 10G6.

over 734 main-chain atoms) (Figure 5(a)). The steroids D rings superimpose particularly well (rmsd Ê 1.6 A) in spite of the presence of a keto group on progesterone at position C17 in place of the 17bhydroxyl group in estradiol and in spite of the different position of the linker used in the immunisation, 11a for DB3 instead of 6 for 10G6. This is not so for the other rings, due to a 30  angle Ê between the steroid axes (rmsd for A rings 5.1 A). Three hydrophobic residues that are in contact in DB3 with the D ring superimpose well with hydrophobic residues in 10G6 (TrpH50, TrpH100 and PheH100b in DB3 superpose with TrpH33, LeuH98 and MetH101 in 10G6) The structures selected within the immune repertoire for the recognition of a single hapten has been the subject of numerous genetic studies. It appears that during the ®rst response to a hapten only a few primary antibody genes are selected. However, recombination of the VH and VL genes together with somatic mutations, generates further diversity.17 In the case of 10G6 and 17E12, the genes and corresponding structures suggest that these antibodies were originally selected independently and later optimised in parallel. This situation is somewhat unusual, as most antibodies raised against the same immunogen show a high degree of structural convergence, with most of the diversity located mainly on the H3 hypervariable loop, which is highly variable both in sequence and size.18 Mapping of the combining sites: models versus crystal structures In advance of the crystallographic studies, models were constructed for both antibodies to predict how estradiol may bind. This was done on the basis of mutational analysis and cross-reactivity measurements.9 These models were used to guide site-directed mutagenesis that did not arrive at the desired goal. With the availability of the crystals structures of the antibody complexes we can try to evaluate why the prediction turned out

to be inaccurate. Overall, there is a quite good agreement between the models and X-ray structures. Thus, modelled Fv region of 10G6 superimposes on the structure (Figure 5(b)) with an rmsd Ê of 1.56 A for 836 main-chain atoms as given by the program ALIGN.19 The deviation observed is mainly due to a slight inaccuracy in the prediction of the VL-VH interface. The superposition is even better if the variable segments are compared indiÊ Ê vidually (VL, rmsd 0.97 A; VH, rmsd 1.32 A). The VL-VH interface is better predicted for 17E12, where the rmsd for the whole variable region is Ê Ê Ê 0.89 A compared to 0.81 A or 0.78 A for separated VL and for VH, respectively. For both antibodies, the modelling identi®ed most of the amino acid residues that compose the paratope. In the case of 10G6, eight residues interact with the hapten in the crystal structure: TrpL91, TrpH33, GlnH35, TrpH47, ArgH58, SerH97, ThrH100a and LeuH98. Only the last two were not identi®ed. The model correctly predicted the involvement of GlnH35 in the stabilisation of the 17b-hydroxyl group via a hydrogen bond at the bottom of the proposed cavity. Residues GlyH95, ThrH100a, and ArgH96 in 10G6 were not predicted correctly. Although not part of the core, these residues are important in the stabilisation of the steroid. The modelled binding pocket and the crystal structure of 17E12 are in good agreement regarding the involvement of HisL89 in hydrogen bonding with the 17b-hydroxyl group. However, the crystal structure shows a second hydrogen bond with TyrL36. Of the nine amino acid residues, TyrL36, TyrL49, HisL89, PheL91, TyrL96, PheH35, GluH95, LysH96 and AspH97 that bury a signi®cant amount of their surface during the interaction with estradiol, only six were predicted correctly by the model. The superimposition of the theoretical models and the X-ray structures showed major deviations of the side-chain positions for both antibodies. Though the functional paratopes are quite well predicted, the local interactions made by some

709 an inaccurate prediction of the linker environment. The X-ray structure of FabH 10G6 complexed with 17b-estradiol-6CMO has corrected these de®ciencies, showing the true nature of the contacts between the linker and the antibody. More precisely, the stabilisation of the carboxy-methyloxime segment, although located outside the combining site, appears to be mediated by several van der Waals contacts and two hydrogen bonds with ArgH58 on the surface of the CDR 2H (Table 2). Such ®rst-rate observation is a strong foundation on which to base a structure-based engineering program to improve the relative af®nity of 10G6 for 17b-estradiol compared to 17b-estradiol-6CMO. A library of variants by saturating mutagenesis of residues 56-60, on the exposed part of the loop 2H containing the interacting residue Arg58, has been constructed by phage display technology and is currently being screened.

critical residues are not described precisely enough. The models predict well the overall position of the framework residues, in particular TrpH33 and TrpH47 in 10G6 and PheH35 and TyrL49 in 17E12, and correctly identi®es one potential hydrogen bond donor located in the bottom of each cavity: but not both. The second most important hydrogen bond is missing because of a slight rotational error in the predicted position of the estradiol (Figure 5(b)). The H3 loops in the theoretical model and crystallographic study differ substantially Ê (rmsd 2.5 A for 56 main-chain atoms of FabH 10G6, Ê and rmsd 1.84 A for 40 main-chain atoms of FabH Ê 17E12) with differences as large as 6.7 A in 10G6 a (H98 LeuC ). Despite its short length, the H3 loop of FabH 17E12 was rather dif®cult to model, due to its non-classical sequence with a proline residue at the end of the torso region. The modelling predicted that LysH96 should be buried while, in fact, it is shown to be accessible to solvent by the X-ray Ê structure, hence the large discrepancy of 5.8 A on Ê Ca and 17 A on Nz for this residue. However, and despite these large structural deviations concerning the conformation of the H3 loops, the core residues located on H3 were identi®ed correctly as delimiting the cavity in the theoretical model, though their positions were predicted incorrectly. Thus, although somewhat inaccurate, the modelling located the binding cavities correctly and a certain number of the residues involved in the interaction and hence was a source of valuable information that needed some important improvements. Structure-based engineering? Modulation of protein properties in general, and of antibodies in particular, can be achieved by rational, semi-rational or more recently by random mutagenesis strategies. The choice of a particular strategy depends on the knowledge available for the molecule to be engineered, and on the goals. Thus, many groups have elaborated strategies to reshape a pre-existing steroid binding site through molecular modelling, site-directed mutagenesis and design or the selection of new antibody fragments by phage display technology.20 ± 25 Our objective is to attempt to improve the sensitivity of our two antibodies to make them more suitable to the development of an ultrasensitive and speci®c immunoassay. Ideally, the reshaped antibody fragments should combine the high degree of speci®city of the initial molecules together with improved af®nity for natural 17bestradiol. Clearly, this means that we have to maintain unchanged the binding pockets as they have been mapped in that study. In this respect, the structural characterisations of 17E12, and 10G6 complexes, constitutes a unique and useful source of information for further re®nement of these antibodies by semi-rational protein engineering. Indeed, owing to de®ciencies in the complex models we obtained initially, our ®rst attempts at af®nity improvement failed, mostly on account of

Materials and Methods
Purification and crystallisation The antibodies 17E12 (IgG1, k2) and 10G6 (IgG1, l3) were produced in ascitic ¯uid. Three forms of these antibodies were prepared and puri®ed as follows. Brie¯y, the ascitic ¯uid was diluted 1:7 (v/v) in high-salt buffer (1.5 M glycine, 3 M NaCl, pH 8.9), then loaded, following the manufacturer's instructions on a protein A column (Pharmacia) and eluted at pH 6.0. The F(abH )2 fragments were obtained by proteolytic cleavage of the IgG by pepsin. The puri®ed IgG were mixed with pepsin-agarose (Sigma P609) in an acidic buffer, with an IgG to pepsin ratio ranging from 1 mg/ 50 units to 1 mg/100 units and digested for 1.5 hours at 37  C. The pepsin-agarose was then eliminated by centrifugation and the F(abH )2 fragments were recovered in the supernatant. The F(abH )2 were further puri®ed by protein A chromatography (Pharmacia). The FabH fragments were obtained by reducing with 30 mM b-mercaptoethanol the most labile disulphide bridges of F(abH )2 and by blocking the corresponding free cysteine residues with 50 mM iodoacetamide. The FabH were further puri®ed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia). Fab fragments were obtained by proteolytic cleavage of the IgG by papainagarose (Sigma). Reaction was conducted in phosphate buffer (100 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 10 mM cysteine, 2 mM EDTA) with an IgG to papain ratio ranging from 1 mg/0.5 unit to 1 mg/10 units and digested for ®ve to 20 hours at 37  C. The Fcg and undigested IgG were removed by protein A chromatography. For both antibodies, the different fragments were concentrated between 5 mg/ml and 15 mg/ml. Crystallisation screenings were conducted in parallel with free protein or complexed protein with estradiol derivatives in ®ve- to tenfold excess, by vapour diffusion at room temperature. For antibody 10G6, initial crystallisation conditions were identi®ed through reverse screening26 but suitable crystals for X-ray diffraction were dif®cult to obtain through additive screening or seeding techniques.27 Small crystals and the protein solution were analysed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) using precast polyacrylamide gels with ampholines yielding separation in the pH range 3.5-9.5 (Pharmacia). The FabH 10G6 was further puri®ed by anion-exchange chromatography on a mono

710
Q column (Pharmacia) to yield species with homogeneous pI. After loading the protein at pH 7.3 in 20 mM TEA, six isospecies were separated by a NaCl gradient. These peaks were collected and crystallisation assays around the previously identi®ed condition were conducted. Two peaks out of the six, eluted with about 30 mM NaCl, gave larger crystals. Free FabH 10G6 crystals were obtained by mixing equal volumes of a reservoir solution 22.5 % (w/w) monomethyl polyethylene glycol 550 with 200 mM imidazole malate (pH 7.0) with FabH at 10 mg/ml. Free crystals belong to space group P212121 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystals of complexed FabH 10G6 with estradiol-6CMO (Figure 1) were obtained in similar conditions by mixing the reservoir solution with FabH complexed with ligand in excess. The complexed crystal form belongs to space group P21 Ê Ê Ê with cell parameters a  70.2 A, b  192.9 A, c  71.1 A,  H b  92.9 with four Fab per asymmetric unit. Because other unit cells with just one molecule are possible Ê Ê Ê (orthorhombic 97.4 A, 102.4 A, 192.9 A; for example) the re®ned NCS operations were checked for being close to 180.o. The constant domains of molecules 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 24 have an average non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) Ê angle of 179.1  and the largest rmsd for atoms is 0.1 A. However, the variable domains of molecules 1-4 are related by a 177  due to a different elbow angle of these Fab molecules. After superposition of the constant Ê regions, there is a 4 A deviation between certain parts of the variable regions of these two molecules, con®rming the choice of space group. For antibody 17E12, small crystals were initially obtained through sparse matrix screenings,28 and incom-

Highly Speci®c Anti-estradiol Antibodies plete factorial experiment.29 Crystals with FabH or F(abH )2 were polycrystalline, although in some cases, single crystals could be separated from each other and used for data collection. Such crystals were obtained by mixing a reservoir solution 18 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mM Ches (pH 9.3) with free F(abH )2 at 10 mg/ml. The crystals belong to space group P21212 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystal of complexed F(abH )2 17E12 were obtained by soaking free crystals with estradiol. Diffraction data were recorded with crystals kept at 4  C at the W32 and D41 station of the LURE synchrotron (Orsay, France) using a MarResearch image plate detector for FabH 17E12 and on a laboratory rotating anode for FabH 10G6. The data were indexed and integrated with DENZO and merged with SCALEPACK.}30 Data collection statistics are summarised in Table 5. Structure determination and refinement 10G6 and 17E12 crystal structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using the program Ê Ê AMoRe31 and data in the 15 A to 4 A range. The variable (VL-VH) and the constant (CL-CH1) regions were searched separately. Models were chosen in the PDB by using the FASTA search and by selecting structures with highest sequence identities and best resolutions. For 10G6, the models used are Se155-4 (code PDB 1mfc) for the variable region34 and HC19 (1gig)35 for the constant one. For 17E12, the models used are 8F5 (code PDB 1bbd)36 for the variable and constant regions. At the end of the molecular replacement, the models consisting of two

The models were re®ned by using conjugate-gradient protocol in X-PLOR and CNS,32 and progress was judged by decrease of the free Rvalue calculated on the basis of 5 % of the re¯ections which were not included in the re®nement. For FabH 10G6 complexed with estradiol6CMO, NCS restraints were applied to the framework regions of the four variable (VL-VH) and four constant (CL-CH1) regions. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were ®rst checked and rebuilt with data corresponding to free antibodies. Omit sA-weighted 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron density maps were examined with the program O37 or TURBO.13 The hypervariable loops of both antibodies are well de®ned in the electron density maps. Statistics for the re®nement of the free structures are summarised in Table 5. For the complexed FabH , ligands were initially removed from the model and omit electron density maps clearly indicate the presence of estradiol for 17E12 and estradiol-6CMO for 10G6. Statistics for the complexed structures are reported in Table 5. The four structures present standard stereochemistry as evaluated by PROCHECK.33 Cross-reactivity with steroids Competitive ELISA titrations using biotinated estradiol and estradiol derivatives were performed to evaluate the speci®city of 17E12 and 10G6 antibodies. Microtitration plates (Maxisorb Nunc) were coated overnight at room temperature with an anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 5 mg/ml diluted in 50 mM NaCO3 (pH 9.6). The plates were washed extensively in 0.05 % PBS-Tween and blocked for one hour at 37  C with 1 % (w/v) non-fat dry milk dissolved in PBS. Subsequently, the anti-estradiol antibody (17E12 or 10G6), diluted in 0.05 % PBS-Tween, was incubated for one hour at 37  C. After washing, serial dilutions of each competitor in presence of 0.1 mg/ml of 17b-estradiol6CMO-biotin were added to the plates for 15 minutes at room temperature with gentle shaking. Finally the streptavidin peroxydase conjugate was incubated for 30 minutes at 37  C and the reaction was revealed with OPD (ortho-phenylenediamine) for 15 minutes. The percentage of cross-reactivity was calculated from the equation: IC50 estradiolaIC50 competitor Â 100 Models of the complexes between each of the 15 estradiol derivatives and both antibodies 10G6 and 17E12 were constructed. Ten estradiol derivatives were constructed from different X-ray structures with estradiol,15 estriol and estrone,8 and ®ve compounds were constructed with CSchem 3Dpro program (5, 6, 13, 14 and 15, Figure 1). All derivatives were placed in the antibodies' combining site by superimposing all estradiol carbon atoms with programs ALIGN19 and O.37 Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates have been deposited into the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession Codes 1JN6 for 10G6 free, 1JNH for 10G6-estradiol-6CMO complex, 1JNL for 17E12 free and 1JNN for 17E12-estradiol.
