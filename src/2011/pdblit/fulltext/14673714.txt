Abstract Previously, we utilized 4-iodopyrazole (4IPzH) as a heavy atom derivative for the initial solution of the crystal structure of the nitrophorin from Rhodnius prolixus, NP1, where it was found to bind to the heme with the iodo group disordered in two positions. We have now determined the structure of the 4IPzH complex of NP4 at pH 7.5 and find that the geometry and bond lengths at the iron center are extremely similar to those of the imidazole (ImH) complex of the same protein (structure determined at pH 5.6), except that the G­H loop is not in the closed conformation. 4IPzH binds to the heme of NP4 in an ordered manner, with the iodo substituent pointed toward the opening of the heme pocket, near the surface of the protein. In order to understand the solution chemistry in terms of the relative binding abilities of 4IPzH, ImH, and histamine (Hm, a physiological ligand for the nitrophorins), we have also investigated the equilibrium binding constants and reduction potentials of these three ligand complexes of the four Rhodnius nitrophorins as a function of pH. We have found that, unlike the other Lewis bases, 4IPzH forms less stable complexes with the Fe(III) than the Fe(II) oxidation states of NP1 and NP4, and similar stability for the two oxidation states of NP2 and NP3, suggesting that this ligand is a softer base than ImH or Hm, for both of which the Fe(III) complexes are more stable than those of Fe(II) for all four nitrophorins. Surprisingly, in spite of this and the much lower basicity of 4IPzH than imidazole and histamine, the EPR g-values of all three ligand complexes are very similar.

Introduction
The nitrophorins (nitro=NO, phorin=carrier) are a group of NO-carrying heme proteins found in the saliva of at least two species of blood-sucking insects, Rhodnius prolixus, the ``kissing bug,'' which has four such proteins [1], and Cimex lectularius, the bedbug, which has one ([2], Weichsel A, Maes EM, Andersen JF, Valenzuela JG, Berry RE, Shokhireva TK, Walker FA, Montfort WR, submitted). These interesting heme proteins sequester nitric oxide that is produced by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that is similar to vertebrate constitutive NOS, which is present in the cells of the salivary glands [3, 4, 5]. The NO is kept stable for long periods of time in the salivary glands by being bound as an axial ligand to the ferriheme centers of the nitrophorin proteins [6]. Upon injection into the tissues of the victim, NO dissociates, diffuses through the tissues to the nearby capillaries to cause vasodilation, and thereby allows more blood to be transported to the site of the wound. At the same time, in the case of the Rhodnius proteins, histamine, whose role is to cause swelling, itching, and the beginning of the immune response, is released by mast cells and platelets of the victim. This histamine binds to the heme sites of the Rhodnius nitrophorins, hence preventing the insectÕs detection for a period of time [7]. The Rhodnius proteins, which have been named NP1­ 4 in order of their abundances in the insect saliva (NP1 most abundant), have been investigated by a number of spectroscopic techniques ([1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], Shokhireva TKh, Smith KM, Andersen JF, Weichsel A, Balfour CA, Montfort WR, Walker FA, submitted) and the solid-state structures of one or more ligand

136

complexes of NP1 [9, 14], NP2 [15], and NP4 [16, 17, 18] have been determined by X-ray crystallography.The structures are unique for heme proteins, in that the heme is located at the open end of a beta-barrel [19], rather than in the more commonly observed largely alphahelical globin or 4-alpha-helix bundle folds. The ferriheme molecule is bound to the protein via a histidine imidazole ligand, and the sixth coordination site is available to bind NO or other ligands. The four nitrophorin proteins of Rhodnius prolixus are likely a result of gene duplication, followed by slow mutation, followed by another gene duplication of each of the first duplicates at different times, followed by additional slow mutation until the present, thus yielding the observed high sequence identity of NP1 and NP4 and lower sequence identity of NP2 and NP3 (90% and 79% identity, respectively, overall 38% identity [1]). In previous studies we showed that the rate and equilibrium constants for NO dissociation from the four Rhodnius nitrophorins are different for each protein within and between the two similar-sequence pairs, NP1, NP4 and NP2, NP3, with NP1 and NP4 losing NO much more rapidly and completely at a given concentration of NO than do NP2 and NP3 [10]. The rate of NO release is about 30­60 times more rapid at pH 8.0 than at pH 5.0 for NP1 and NP4, but only about twice as rapid for NP2 and NP3 under the same conditions [10]. Thus, we have hypothesized that the reason for the persistence of the four Rhodnius nitrophorin genes through time is that the different equilibrium binding properties of the four proteins under physiologically relevant conditions help to spread out the release of NO to the victimÕs tissues over a longer period of time and larger concentration range than could any single protein [10]. The histamine complex dissociation constants have also been measured at pH 8.0 [10], but not all at the same temperature; thus, before the present work it was not clear whether the histamine binding abilities also vary significantly for the four nitrophorins, nor was the nature of the pH dependence clear. The first structure of the first nitrophorin, NP1, to be solved used several heavy-atom derivatives, including that in which 4-iodopyrazole (4IPzH) was complexed to the ferriheme iron [14], and although this complex was very useful in the initial solution of the structure of the protein, the structure of the 4IPzH complex itself was not refined and reported at that time. More recently, we have ° refined the structure of NP1­4IPzH to about 2.1 A. We have also soaked 4IPzH into the NP4 crystals used for high-resolution structure determinations [17, 18], collected X-ray diffraction data, refined that structure to a ° resolution of 1.25 A, and have compared these structures to that reported previously for NP4­imidazole (ImH) [18].We have also obtained the EPR spectra of NP1­ 4IPzH and NP4­ImH in frozen aqueous solution at 4.2 K for comparison to those of NP2­ImH [13] and NP1­histamine (Hm) [20], in order to compare the dorbital splitting abilities of the three azole-donor ligands. In order to understand the ambient temperature solution chemistry of 4IPzH as a ligand that binds to the

same distal binding site of the nitrophorins as that to which the two physiological ligands (NO and Hm) bind, and the relative binding abilities of ImH and Hm, we have measured and compared the equilibrium binding constants of the 4IPzH, ImH, and Hm complexes of the four Rhodnius nitrophorins in their physiologically relevant oxidation state [Fe(III)]. In order to understand the relative stability of these ligand complexes of the two biologically relevant oxidation states of iron, their reduction potentials have also been determined. Thus, the work presented herein provides a comparison of the solution complexation abilities of the four nitrophorins toward three azole ligands, Hm, ImH, and 4IPzH, the relative stabilities of their Fe(III) and Fe(II) complexes, the d-orbital splitting patterns that result from the binding of each of these ligands to a representative nitrophorin, and the crystal structure of the 4IPzH complex of NP4 (and to a limited extent NP1).

Materials and methods
Sample preparation For measurement of equilibrium constants and electrochemical studies the recombinant nitrophorins NP1­4 were prepared as described previously [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and stored in lyophilized form at )80 °C; for crystal growth, NP4 samples were not lyophilized. Protein solutions ($0.1 mM) for electrochemical studies were prepared as described previously in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at the appropriate pH using 1 mM methyl viologen (Aldrich) and 0.2 mM Ru(NH3)6Cl3 (Alfa) as electrochemical mediators [9]. In some cases, 1-methyl-4,4¢-bipyridium (prepared as described by Yamaguchi et al. [21]) was used instead of the dimethyl analog, typically called methyl viologen. Ligand binding constants to the ferriheme forms of the nitrophorins were carried out utilizing solutions that also contained 0.1 M phosphate buffer at the chosen pH.

Measurement of ligand binding constants for Fe(III) complexes of the nitrophorins These measurements were carried out by adding aliquots of the chosen axial ligand to 10 lM solutions of the nitrophorins and recording the optical spectra from 300 to 700 nm. Because of the high ligand affinities, even under these dilute solution conditions a significant fraction of the added ligand was bound, and so a mutually depleting model [22, 23] was used to analyze the data: DA=DAmax ¼ ðPt& Lt þ Kd Þ=ð2Pt Þ þ h i0:5 ' =ð2Pt Þ À ðPt þ Lt þ Kd Þ2 Àð4Lt Pt Þ

ð1Þ

where DA is the change in absorbance at a given wavelength for a specific total ligand concentration Lt, DAmax is the change in absorbance of the fully complexed species at the same wavelength (determined by extrapolation), Pt is the total protein concentration and Kd (=1/KeqIII) is the ligand dissociation constant (M) for ligand L from the Fe(III) protein.

Spectroelectrochemical titrations These were carried out using the same instrumentation and the same reference electrode (Ag/AgCl, E°=)205 mV vs. SHE) as described previously [9, 10]. The temperature of the measurements was

137 27±1 °C. The spectroelectrochemical titrations were carried out as described previously [9, 10], by setting the potential at some value Eapp and waiting until the optical spectrum did not change with time, then recording the optical spectrum, followed by setting a new potential Eapp and repeating the process, etc. The data are analyzed in terms of the Nernst equation, which describes the effect of applied potential on the ratio of the concentrations of oxidized and reduced forms of the complex and the standard reduction potential, E°: Eapp ¼ E þ 2:303ðRT =nF Þlog10 ð½Ox=½RedÞ ð2Þ Table 1 Crystallographic data and refinement statistics for NP4-4IPzH Crystallographic data Space group ° a, b,c (A) b (°) ° Wavelength (A) Temperature (K) ° Resolution (A) Total reflections Unique reflections Completeness (%)a Redundancy (%)a MeanI/r(I)a Rsyma Refinement statistics No. of amino acid residues No. of non-hydrogen atoms No. of waters Rcrystb Rfreec ° R.m.s.d. of bond dist.

where Eapp is the applied potential, E° is the reduction potential determined from these data, and [Ox] and [Red] are the concentrations of the protein in the Fe(III) and Fe(II) states, respectively, in the presence of either no ligand or a high enough concentration of ligand L to insure full complexation of both oxidation states. [Ox] and [Red] are calculated from the optical spectra using BeerÕs law. E° is determined as the intercept of the plot of log([Ox]/[Red]) versus applied potential Eapp. The slope of this plot is 2.303RT/ nF=59 mV at 25 °C, or 59.5 mV at 27 °C. The shift of the FeIII/FeII reduction potential when a ligand L is bound to the iron is a measure of the ratio of the Fe­L binding constants for the two oxidation states, since the Nernst equation (Eq. 2) can be rewritten as:    III II ð3Þ Ec À E ¼ ÀðRT =nF Þln Keq =Keq where E° is the measured potential for the nitrophorin fully comc plexed to the ligand L in both oxidation states, E° is the measured potential for the nitrophorin in the absence of L, and KeqIII and KeqII are the binding constants for ligand L to the Fe(III) and Fe(II) states, respectively.

EPR spectroscopy The EPR spectra of NP1­4IPzH and NP4­ImH were recorded in frozen D2O buffer solution (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0), at 4.2 K on a Bruker ESP-300E EPR spectrometer operating at X-band, using a Systron-Donner frequency counter to measure the microwave frequency. Instrument settings included 0.2 mW microwave power, 100 kHz field modulation, and a modulation amplitude of 4 G.

Results and discussion
Spectroelectrochemistry of the axial ligand complexes of the nitrophorins In Fig. 1 are shown the optical spectra of NP3 in the presence of a 10-fold excess of 4IPzH at pH 5.5 as a function of applied potential. Good isosbestic behavior and reversibility over many cycles of positive and negative applied potential are observed. Using spectral data such as those of Fig. 1, a Nernst plot such as that shown in the inset of this figure was constructed and the midpoint potential was obtained from the y-intercept. From similar measurements and calculations, the midpoint potentials of the complexes of all four nitrophorins with 4IPzH, ImH, and Hm were determined. The results are summarized in Table 2, where all potentials are expressed versus SHE (+205 mV with respect to the Ag/ AgCl reference electrode used for the spectroelectrochemical measurements). Because of questions about the potentials reported previously for NP3 [11], spectroelectrochemical titrations of NP3 with NO were repeated and the values obtained are also summarized in Table 2. For spectroelectrochemical titrations of the ImH and Hm complexes of the four nitrophorins, the spectra also show additional absorbances at 396 nm and below at very negative potential settings owing to the beginning of one-electron reduction of the low-potential mediator, methyl viologen. These absorbances grew quite large at

Structure determination Crystals of NP4 were obtained by the hanging drop method from 2.8 M ammonium phosphate, 100 mM TrisÆHCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature. To obtain the NP4­4IPzH complex, a single NP4 crystal of 0.5·0.5·0.05 mm was transferred at first to 3.5 M potassium phosphate for 1 h, then to a similar solution supplemented with 20 mM 4IPzH. After a 12-h equilibration with 4IPzH the crystal was transferred again to 3.5 M potassium phosphate for 15 min and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were measured at ° SSRL, Stanford, beam-line 7-1, using 1.08 A wavelength X-rays and a MAR345 image plate detector, and processed with d*TREK [24] to ° a maximum resolution of 1.25 A (Table 1). The structure of NP4­ 4IPzH was built using difference Fourier methods, the program O [25], and PDB entry 1D2U as a starting model. Refinement was with SHELXL [26] and other computations with CCP4 [27]. Anisotropic temperature factors were refined for all non-hydrogen atoms in the final cycles of refinement and restraints for the heme, proximal histidine, and distal ligand were removed, leading to a model with excellent geometry and little bias in the iron coordination sphere (Table 1). The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry code 1ML7). The NP1­4IPzH complex was used in the structure determination of NP1 [14]. A model was built using difference Fourier approaches and partially refined. However, the data were of much worse quality than the identical complex with NP4, and so we consider it below in only a limited capacity.

potentials more negative than )450 mV vs. SHE, and caused the spectra at these potentials to no longer hold to the isosbestic point near 416 nm. As a result, the absorbances at 430 nm, somewhat beyond the Soret maximum of the reduced form of the complexes, were used to obtain results that showed good Nernstian behavior. In some cases a mediator with a more negative reduction potential, 1-methyl-4,4¢-bipyridium, was used to check the potentials obtained with methyl viologen. From the data presented in Table 2 it can be seen that in the vast majority of cases there is a negative shift of about 20­60 mV in reduction potential upon raising the pH from 5.5 to 7.5, or 10­30 mV per pH unit. This is much smaller than expected for a proton-linked redox reaction, and is instead indicative of the fact that the nitrophorins are in between pKa values of the heme propionates and histidine imidazole deprotonation, as discussed previously [9]. The only clear exception to this rule found thus far is for one of the distal pocket mutants of NP2, the L122V,L132V double mutant, which shows a negative shift of 140 mV for the ligand-free protein over the pH range 5.5­7.5 [13]. The structure of this mutant protein has not yet been determined, so at the time of publication of this study it was hypothesized that this larger pH dependence may be due to deprotonation of water molecules in the distal pocket [13]. The much more negative reduction potentials (250­ 300 mV more negative) of the ligand-free nitrophorins, NP1­NP4, than that for met-myoglobin (+28 and 0 mV at pH 5.5 and 7.5, respectively [9]) are likely due to the presence of carboxylate groups, either the buried carboxylate (Glu55 for NP1, NP4, Glu53 for NP2, NP3) or those in the A­B loop (Asp30, Glu32, Asp34 for NP1 and NP4, Asp29, Asp31, Asp36 for NP2 and NP3) near the heme. Preliminary investigations of mutants of the buried carboxylate suggest that this residue is responsible for approximately 100­150 mV of the negative shift of the reduction potential of the proteins (Berry RE,

Montfort WR, Walker FA, work in progress). It is likely that Asp70 (NP1, NP4), which hydrogen bonds to a water molecule which in turn hydrogen bonds to the imidazole N­H of His59, is not involved in this negative shift in reduction potential as compared to met-myoglobin, because it is protonated at the pH at which structures have been determined (5.5­7.5) [14, 16, 17, 18], and also because in NP2 and NP3 this residue is an asparagine (Asn68), yet the structures of NP1 [14], NP4 [16, 17, 18], and NP2 [15] are the same in this region, as are the pH dependences of their reduction potentials (Table 2). It can also be seen from the data in Table 2 that the reduction potentials of the NO and 4-IPzH complexes are shifted positive of those of the ligand-free nitrophorins, while those of the ImH and Hm complexes are shifted negative in each case. These shifts in potential are a measure of the relative stability of the ligand complexes of the Fe(III) and Fe(II) oxidation states, as measured by the ratio KeqIII/KeqII calculated from the reduction potentials using Eq. 3, and they indicate that the NO and 4IPzH complexes of Fe(II) are more stable than those of Fe(III), while the ImH and Hm complexes of Fe(III) are more stable than those of Fe(II). The most dramatic potential shifts are those of the NO complexes reported previously [9, 10] and summarized in Table 2, which give rise to calculated ratios KeqII/KeqIII that show that the Fe(II)­NO complexes are more stable than the Fe(III)­NO complexes by factors ranging from 4·105 (NP2) to 1.6·107 (NP1) or logKeqII to 5.60 or 7.20 at pH 5.5 and similar factors at pH 7.5 [9, 10]. Part of this difference in stability of the NO complexes of the two oxidation states may be due to stabilization of the Fe(III)­NO complexes because of the large degree of ruffling of the heme [18]: Mutating Leu132, or both Leu122 and Leu132, to valine in NP2 yields a 90 mV positive shift in the reduction potential of the NO complexes of these two mutants, indicating an

approximate 32-fold stabilization of the Fe(II)­NO forms of these complexes, thus increasing the stability factor KeqII/KeqIII to 1.4·106 or log of the ratio to 6.15 for these NP2 mutants [13]. Hence, the ruffling maintained in the wild-type nitrophorins appears to help stabilize the Fe(III)­NO oxidation state of the proteins. In addition to the ruffling, the potential negative charges near the heme that could stabilize the Fe(III) state when the carboxylate side chains are deprotonated

may be important in the utilization of these nitrophorins as NO-releasing proteins. The net positive charge of the Fe(III) center, which is present in both the NO-free and NO-complexed forms of the nitrophorins, should be significantly stabilized by the negative charges of these carboxylate side chains when the carboxylates are deprotonated [9, 28]. This stabilization of the Fe(III) oxidation state would help to ensure that the Fe(III)­NO complex is not autoreduced, because the KeqIII values are

140

of just the appropriate size (106­107 M)1 at pH 7.5, logKeqIII=6­7, Table 2) to allow NO release upon dilution of the saliva into the tissues of the victim, while the KeqII values are so large (1013­1014 M)1 at pH 7.5 [10], or logKeqII=13­14, Table 2) that NO would not be released to aid the insect in obtaining a sufficient blood meal. The crystal structures of the open loop (NP4­ NH3, PDB entry 1D2U; NP4­H2O, PDB entry 1D3S; NP4­CN, PDB entry 1EQD; NP4­Hm, PDB entry 1IKE) [16, 17, 18] and closed loop (NP4­NO, PDB entry 1KOI; NP4­ImH, PDB entry 1IKJ) [17, 18] forms of NP4 clearly show that Asp30, Glu32, Asp35, and Asp129 are closer to the Fe(III) center in the closed than in the open loop form (8.00 versus 8.49, 12.55 versus ° 15.54, 10.35 versus 16.58, and 11.60 versus 14.73 A, respectively), but the same structures all indicate that these carboxylates are protonated throughout the pH range of the structure determinations (5.5­7.5) for the closed loop forms, and are solvent-exposed for the open loop forms. Therefore, there should be few if any negative charges near the heme of the closed loop forms of NP4 over this pH range, while the open loop forms could deprotonate at the higher pH. However, the fact that NP4­Hm has an open loop while NP4­ImH has a closed loop structure [17, 18], yet the two show similar pH dependence in their reduction potentials and Fe(III) binding constants (see next section), suggests that the difference in loop structure may not lead to deprotonation of these carboxylates at pH 7.5. Nevertheless, preliminary electrochemical data for the D30N and D30A mutants of NP4 in the absence of NO show that both mutants have more positive reduction potentials than the wild-type protein, by 50 mV at pH 5.5 and 70 mV at pH 7.5 (Berry RE, Montfort WR, Walker FA, work in progress), but the reduction potentials of the axial ligand complexes of these mutants have not yet been investigated. Thus, the effect of the carboxylates of the A­B

loop has yet to be fully elucidated, and the $300 mV more negative reduction potential of the nitrophorins as compared to met-Mb and its NO complex has yet to be quantitatively explained. Equilibrium constants for ligand addition to the sixth coordination site of the ferric forms of the nitrophorins The optical spectra obtained from a typical titration of NP2 at pH 7.5 with histamine are shown in Fig. 2a, and the best fit of the data is shown in Fig. 2b. Equilibrium constants measured in this work, as well as those reported previously for NO and histamine addition to the nitrophorins [10], are presented in Table 2. Since the binding constants for histamine are extremely large, utilization of the full Eq. 1 was required because the concentration of ligand utilized in forming the complex could not be neglected [22, 23]. In all cases, for the Fe(III) oxidation state, the values of KeqIII (=1/KdIII), were measured directly from optical absorption data as described in the experimental section; the extremely large magnitude of most of these KeqIII values leads to estimated error limits of ±25%, or logKeqIII=±0.1­0.13. The equilibrium constants for the Fe(II) oxidation state, KeqII, were derived from the directly measured KeqIII values using the ratio KeqIII/KeqII calculated from the reduction potentials using Eq. 3; the logarithms of these values are also included in Table 2. As discussed previously [10], the equilibrium constant data presented in Table 2 show that logKeqIII for Hm binding is larger than for NO binding at pH 7.5, with the differences ranging from two and more than one orders of magnitude for NP1 and NP4, respectively, to very small (a factor of two in the binding constants) for NP2. Thus, as mentioned previously [10], histamine, released by the

141

victim of the bite, at equal concentrations, can displace NO, especially in the case of NP1 and NP4, and thus provide a second means to help the insect obtain a sufficient blood meal. For Hm binding, the equilibrium constant KeqIII increases with increasing pH. The increase of logKeqIII over the pH range 5.5­7.5 is from 0.9 to 1.6 for the four nitrophorins (Table 2). For logKeqII the increases over the same pH range are generally smaller. As in the case of Hm, the logKeqIII values for ImH binding are larger at pH 7.5 than at pH 5.5, by 1.1­1.9. Nevertheless, the value of logKeqIII for Hm is larger than for ImH (at pH 7.5 by 1.2­1.3 for NP1 and NP4, respectively), but the difference is much smaller for NP2 and NP3. Clearly, Fe(III) is a much better Lewis acid than the proton toward ImH, in that it binds with logKeqIII values in the 5­6 range at pH 5.5 for all four nitrophorins. In comparison, logKeqII for ImH increases by 1.2­1.8 between pH 5.5 and 7.5 for the four nitrophorins. For 4IPzH, logKeqIII decreases slightly with increasing pH for NP1 and NP4, but increases with increasing pH for NP2 and NP3; logKeqII decreases slightly with increasing pH for all except NP2. 4IPzH is a much weaker base {pKa(BH+)%2.7 [29]} than ImH {pKa(BH+)=6.65 [30]} or Hm {pKa(BH+)=5.94 [30]}, and it has a smaller affinity (logKeqIII smaller by 0.9­1.7 at pH 5.5, and 2.4­2.6 at pH 7.5) for the oxidized NPs than does ImH [although not nearly as much smaller as its pKa(BH+) value would have suggested], but generally greater affinity than ImH for the reduced nitrophorins (Table 2). Overall, 4IPzH appears to be a softer base than ImH. This conclusion is based upon the fact that while the binding constants for Hm and ImH are larger for Fe(III) than for Fe(II) at both pH 5.5 and 7.5, those of 4IPzH are smaller or similar in size for Fe(III) as compared to Fe(II). EPR spectra of the NP1 complex with 4IPzH The EPR spectra of NP1­4IPzH and NP4­ImH are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, both spectra are rhombic, with g-values very similar to those of NP2 and its distal pocket mutants complexed to ImH [13] and NP1­Hm [20], and are in all cases indicative of ferriheme centers bound to two ImH-like ligands. The NP1­4IPzH g-values lead to calculated ligand field (d-orbital) splitting parameters [31] of D/k (tetragonality)=4.33, V/k (rhombic splitting)=4.81, and V/D (rhombicity, a purely geometric quantity)=1.11. These values may be compared to those of NP1, NP2, and NP4­ImH, with D/ k=3.61­4.05, V/k=3.17­3.34, and V/D=0.82­0.88 [10, 13, 20], to that of NP1­Hm, with D/k=4.37, V/k=3.84, and V/D=0.88 [20], and to those of cytochromes b5, with D/k=3.68­4.10, V/k=2.88­3.27, and V/D=0.78­82 [32, 33], which in all cases are indicative of ferriheme centers bound to two imidazole-like ligands, in which the two axial ligands are in approximately parallel planes [34, 35]. The tetragonality parameter, D/k, has previously

been considered diagnostic of the basicity of the axial ligands, which was extremely useful some 30 years ago for predicting the axial ligands (and state of histidine protonation/deprotonation) of newly reported low-spin ferriheme proteins [36, 37], and still is useful today [38]. Hence, it is somewhat surprising that in spite of its much lower basicity, the 4IPzH ligand, at least when bound opposite a histidine imidazole, does not create a significantly different ligand field than an ImH or Hm ligand bound to the sixth position of the nitrophorins. However, it does create a larger rhombicity, V/D, as is the case for the bis-pyrazole [39] and bis-3-aminopyrazole [40] complexes of model hemes, for which the calculated tetragonalities are smaller (D/k=2.81 and 3.83, respectively) and more in line with the ligand basicities {pKa(BH+)=2.2 and 5.5, respectively [30]}. Hence it is possible that the proximal histidine imidazole ligand so dominates the crystal field splittings of the nitrophorin complexes that the nature of the sixth ligand is only minimally important. Crystal structure of the NP4 complex with 4IPzH The asymmetric unit of the crystal contained one molecule of NP4­4IPzH, 263 water molecules, and a second 4IPzH molecule positioned between two protein molecules in the crystal lattice. The latter molecule lies near a two-fold crystallographic axis and is positionally disordered. The overall NP4 geometry is similar to that found in other NP4 structures [18]. In particular, the pyrazole ring is in almost exactly the same orientation as the

142

imidazole rings in the NP4­ImH and NP4­Hm complexes [18]. The iodine atom lies towards the opening of the binding pocket, near the heme propionates (Fig. 4). This single orientation of the ligand in NP4 is in contrast to the NP1­4IPzH complex, where two ligand orientations are observed, one rotated 180° from the other about the Fe­N bond. The His59 imidazole ring makes an angle of 48° to the pyrrole nitrogens of rings A and C, an angle of 132° for the A heme rotational isomer, as measured counterclockwise from the pyrrole rings C (II) and A (IV), or an angle of 138° for the B isomer. The pyrazole ring of the distal ligand makes an angle of 61° with the same axis, an angle of 119° counterclockwise for the A heme rotational isomer, or 151° for the B isomer, yielding a dihedral angle between the two ligands of 13°. In comparison, the His59 imidazole ring of the NP4­ImH complex makes an angle of 51° to the pyrrole nitrogens of rings A and C, or 129° counterclockwise for the A heme rotational isomer, or 141° clockwise for the B isomer, while the exogenous imidazole ring of the NP4­ImH complex makes an angle of 65° to the pyrrole nitrogens of rings A and C, which is 115° counterclockwise of the pyrrole nitrogens C (II) and A (IV) for the A heme rotational isomer, or 155° clockwise for the B isomer [18], a dihedral angle between the two ligands of 14°, and thus the orientations of the exogenous ligands in the two complexes are nearly identical (Fig. 5). In NP4­4IPzH the position of the pyrazole ring is restricted through van der Waals con° ° tacts with Leu123 (3.9 A), Leu133 (3.6 A), and a weak

° hydrogen bond to a water molecule (3.0 A) that is also hydrogen bonded to Thr121 (Fig. 4). ImH displays a similar hydrogen bond, but to a different water molecule, owing to the alternate position of the ring nitrogen [18]. The Fe­N(Por) bond lengths of the 4IPzH complex ° ° (1.96, 2.00, 2.02, 2.02 A, average 2.00 A) are slightly shorter than those of the ImH complex of NP4 (1.98, ° ° 2.03, 2.00, 1.95 A, average 1.99 A); the Fe­N(Ax) bond lengths of the 4IPzH complex are more equal [2.00 (His), ° 1.99 (4IPzH) A] than those of the ImH complex [1.95 ° (His), 2.02 (ImH) A]. Although the resolution of the two structures is quite high, these differences are probably within the experimental error of the measurements. In terms of the immediate heme environment, the two structures are extremely similar, with essentially the same exogenous ligand plane orientation and dihedral angle to the histidine imidazole ligand plane, except for an approximately 3° rotation of both axial ligands with respect to the porphyrin core. This 3° rotation may represent a slight difference in the heme ``seating'' in the structures of the two complexes. The small dihedral angles of 13° for the 4IPzH complex and 14° for the

143

ImH complex of NP4 are consistent with the observation of rhombic EPR signals (Fig. 3). As mentioned above, the nitrophorins contain a severely ruffled heme that may contribute to stabilizing the ferric heme state [18]. This distortion appears to have both steric and electronic components, with binding of NO leading to substantially increased ruffling [17]. As shown in the formal core diagrams of Fig. 5, the heme in NP4­4IPzH is slightly less distorted than that for NP4­ ImH, both of which are much less distorted than in the NO complex. The ruffling and saddling components, as ° defined in [18] and [41], are )0.324 and 0.222 A, respectively, for NP4­4IPzH, slightly less than for NP4­ ° imidazole ()0.422 and 0.306 A) [18]. The ruffling component gives rise to a rotation in the heme pyrrole rings with respect to the mean plane of the four heme nitrogen atoms, leading to rotations of 7.8°, )2.3°, 5.2°, and )3.9° for the A, B, C, and D rings, respectively, in NP4­ 4IPzH, as compared to 6.9°, )5.3°, 7.4°, and )4.0° in NP4­ImH [18]. Further from the heme, the nitrophorins undergo a conformational change upon binding NO or imidazole that involves large positional shifts in the two loops at the entrance to the distal pocket, resulting in a closed conformation and completely buried ligands [17], as mentioned above. This conformational change is only partially observed in the NP4­4IPzH structure. Although the A­B loop, between residues 32 and 38, has a closed conformation similar to that displayed in NP4­ ImH and NP4­NO [17], the G­H loop, residues 125­131, is in an open conformation resembling that displayed in the NP4­Hm and NP4­NH3 structures [17]. This mixed conformation is in part a consequence of a steric conflict between the iodine atom and the 130­131 peptide fragment of NP4. While the positively charged aliphatic amine side chain of histamine stabilizes the open conformation through hydrogen bonding to Asp30, the similarly located iodine atom in 4IPzH turns this proton accepting group away. The pH at which the NP4­4IPzH structure was determined (7.5) may also contribute to the partially open conformation since the closed conformer is destabilized at this pH [17].

Conclusions
In conclusion, we find that although a much weaker base toward the proton than imidazole, 4-iodopyrazole is a good ligand for the nitrophorins; its complexes have similar EPR spectra and very similar structures in the solid state to those of the corresponding imidazole complexes. However, in homogeneous solution it differs from imidazole as a ligand in that in general it forms more stable complexes with the Fe(II) than with the Fe(III) state of the nitrophorins, the sign of its being a softer base than imidazole.
