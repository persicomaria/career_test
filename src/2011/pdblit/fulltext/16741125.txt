second coincident TonB could not use the Tonbox in binding, so its affinity would be much lower (as has been observed). Binding of the substrate to the transporter likely induces an orderto-disorder transition in the Ton-box (8), and this disordered Ton-box is the recognition element for TonB. Because the TonB-transporter interaction is transient (i.e., TonB may interact serially with multiple outer membrane transporters to perform multiple transport cycles), the presence of disorder (high entropy) of the Ton-box is a useful strategy for obtaining high specificity without high affinity (30). The disordered Ton-box may be useful for sweeping out a larger volume within the periplasm, thus increasing the probability of encountering TonB. The conserved salt bridge between the Ton-box and TonB may be critical for longer range electrostatic attraction and nucleation of b strand formation of the Ton-box. Lastly, the structure of this complex, particularly the Ton-box:TonB region, may be useful in structure-based lead compound discovery for novel antibacterials. The addition of Ton-box peptides to media inhibits bacterial growth (31), and the expression of periplasmic domains of TonB inhibits transporter function (32). Both of these results indicate that disruption of the physiological TonB:Ton-box interface may provide a drug-discovery paradigm.

Structure of TonB in Complex with FhuA, E. coli Outer Membrane Receptor
Peter D. Pawelek,1 Nathalie Croteau,1 Christopher Ng-Thow-Hing,1 Cezar M. Khursigara,1 Natalia Moiseeva,2 Marc Allaire,2 James W. Coulton1* The cytoplasmic membrane protein TonB spans the periplasm of the Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope, contacts cognate outer membrane receptors, and facilitates siderophore transport. The outer membrane receptor FhuA from Escherichia coli mediates TonB-dependent import of ferrichrome. We report the 3.3 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the TonB carboxyl-terminal domain in complex with FhuA. TonB contacts stabilize FhuA's amino-terminal residues, including those of the consensus Ton box sequence that form an interprotein b sheet with TonB through strand exchange. The highly conserved TonB residue arginine-166 is oriented to form multiple contacts with the FhuA cork, the globular domain enclosed by the b barrel. ron is an essential element in bacteria for a number of redox processes (1). It is highly insoluble in its ferric (Fe3þ) form at physiological pH. To overcome the low bioavailability of Fe3þ, Gram-negative bacteria have

evolved strategies for high-affinity Fe3þ uptake. One well-characterized strategy involves transduction of energy from the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) to the outer membrane (OM), resulting in active transport of Fe3þ chelated to molecules known as siderophores. Central to this process, the CM-anchored energy-transducing protein TonB spans the periplasm and contacts OM-embedded receptors that bind metal-chelated siderophores. TonB, through uncharacterized conformational changes, transduces energy from SCIENCE VOL 312

the CM_s proton motive force to the receptor and facilitates siderophore transport into the periplasm. Existing structural data that describe key protein components of the siderophore transport cycle highlight outstanding questions regarding the overall molecular mechanism (2). The CM protein TonB is composed of three domains. An N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 33) is anchored to the CM and makes contacts with proteins ExbB and ExbD to form an energytransducing complex. A C-terminal domain (residues 155 to 239) directly contacts receptors in the OM. An intermediate domain (residues 34 to 154) contains a region of alternating Pro-Glu and Pro-Lys repeats located between residues 66 and 100. There is currently no known structure for the entire TonB protein. However, three structures have been reported for the TonB Cterminal domain. Its oligomeric states are variable and correlate with lengths of the recombinant constructs used to obtain the structures: a tightly interwoven dimer, residues 155 to 239 (3); a loose dimer, residues 148 to 239 (4); and a monomer, residues 103 to 239 (5). The monomeric C-terminal domain consists of two a helices positioned on the same face of a fourstranded antiparallel b sheet, strand b4 being located at the C terminus of TonB. The OM receptor FhuA is the Escherichia coli transporter of the hydroxamate siderophore

Structurally homologous TonBdependent OM receptors include the E. coli transporters of cobalamin (BtuB) (6), ferric citrate (FecA) (7), and ferric enterobactin (FepA) (8). The crystal structure of FhuA demonstrates (9, 10) a porin-like protein, with a 22-stranded C-terminal b barrel domain that encloses a globular N-terminal cork domain. Ferrichrome binds to the receptor via extracellular loops and apical regions of the cork domain. The cork domain occludes the lumen of the barrel, preventing passive diffusion of ferrichrome. Characteristic of TonB-dependent OM receptors, FhuA possesses an N-terminal consensus sequence termed the Ton box (8TITVTA13) that was not visible in the reported three-dimensional structures of FhuA. We crystallized a purified complex of TonB (residues 33 to 239) and FhuA (residues 1 to 725) and collected data on a single TonB-FhuA crystal (11). The TonB-FhuA crystal structure consists of one protomer of TonB in complex with one protomer of FhuA (Fig. 1). The model was refined at

TonB interacts with the periplasm-exposed face of FhuA such that TonB helices a1 and a2 are oriented toward FhuA, with the TonB b sheet (composed of b1 to b3) distal to the FhuA barrel (Fig. 1A). The TonB protomer occupies approximately one-half of the periplasm-exposed surface area of FhuA and occludes the barrel lumen from the edge containing periplasmic turns 8 to 10 to a boundary delineated by a straight line between periplasmic turns 1 and 7 (Fig. 1B). Inspection of the TonB-FhuA structure relative to FhuA 1QFF revealed minor structural rearrangements Eroot mean square deviation (RMSD) 0 0.23 )^ upon TonB binding. Structural changes proximal to the bound TonB are localized to the periplasmic turns of the FhuA barrel as well as the periplasm-exposed loop at the C terminus of the cork domain (fig. S1).

The N-terminal globular cork domain (residues 19 to 160) of FhuA is enclosed by the C-terminal b-barrel domain (residues 161 to 725). The cork domain possesses a four-stranded b sheet between residues 47 and 154. The barrel domain is composed of 22 antiparallel b strands. The b strands terminate in 11 long loops on one face of the barrel and 10 short turns on the other face (Fig. 1A). Given the membrane topology of FhuA, the loops and turns are exposed to the extracellular environment and periplasm, respectively. A molecule of ferricrocin was observed bound to FhuA in a position not much different from that observed for the ligandloaded FhuA structure 1QFF. TonB residues 158 to 235 were observed in the TonB-FhuA structure (see supporting online text).

The overall Ca-Ca RMSD between FhuA-complexed TonB and TonB 1U07 is 0.93 ). The largest main-chain deviations are localized mainly to the C terminus from residues Ile232 to Thr235. The Ca-Ca deviation relative to 1U07 at TonB Ile232 is 2.0 ), whereas at Thr235 the Ca-Ca deviation is 3.5 ). We observed extensive and continuous electron density N-terminal to FhuA Glu19 and extending toward TonB. This unambiguous electron density allowed us to build FhuA residues 9 to 18 into the model, encompassing five of the six residues in the conserved FhuA Ton box consensus (Fig. 1C). The FhuA Ton box forms a parallel b interaction with b3 of the TonB Cterminal domain, extending the b sheet. FhuA residues Ile9, Thr10, Val11, and Ala13 interact with TonB residues Val225, Val226, Leu229, and Lys231, respectively (table S2). These interactions result in the formation of an interprotein b sheet with TonB b1 to b3 (Fig. 2A). The side chain of TonB Gln160, a residue previously shown to interact with the Ton box, was not visible in the electron density; a specific mode of interaction between this residue and the FhuA Ton box was not immediately apparent. However, sampling of the preferred side-chain rotamers at TonB residue 160 suggests a potential interaction with the FhuA Ton box via a hydrogen bond with the Fig. 3.

main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Thr12 (Fig. 2B). The residue immediately N-terminal to FhuA Thr12 is a position of conserved hydrophobicity. In FhuA this position is occupied by a valine residue. Multiple alignment of the Ton box regions of related TonB-dependent OM receptors (BtuB, FecA, FepA; fig. S2, red) reveals this position to be invariably occupied by valine. The hydrophobic environment at this position may SCIENCE VOL 312

contribute to the observed instability of TonB Gln160. The TonB-FhuA interprotein b sheet positions TonB a1 and a2, the two helices of the TonB C-terminal domain, such that they are oriented toward the periplasmic face of FhuA (Fig. 1C). The recently solved nuclear magnetic resonance structure of monomeric TonB (5) indicates that the C terminus of the protein folds back to form the fourth strand (b4) of the central b sheet of

the C-terminal TonB domain. We do not observe TonB b4 in our structure. Instead, the C terminus of TonB extends away from the complex, such that the FhuA Ton box forms a parallel b interaction with TonB b3 (Fig.2C). This observation clearly demonstrates that the complexation of TonB to FhuA occurs via strand exchange. Our in vitro surface plasmon resonance studies (12, 13) indicated that TonB-FhuA complexation involves a kinetically limiting conformational rearrangement. The present structure showing exchange of TonB b4 with the FhuA Ton box corroborates these biophysical observations and suggests that formation of the interprotein b sheet is the initial committed step of TonB-FhuA complexation. The complex that we observe in this structure is likely the 1:1 high-affinity complex identified by biophysical methods. Interactions between a FhuA Ton box peptide and residues from TonB b3 and b4 were recently reported (5). Ton box residues may therefore form low-affinity encounter interactions with TonB b3 and b4 before formation of the stable interprotein b sheet. TonB Gln160 likely participates in these encounter interactions, perhaps facilitating displacement of TonB b4. A cysteine cross-linking study (14) mapped a complex network of interactions between TonB residues 159 and 164 such that each TonB residue interacted with multiple residues in the BtuB Ton box. This is consistent with TonB residues at or near Gln160 being involved in multiple transient encounter interactions before high-affinity complex formation. The TonB-FhuA interface has a mean interfacial accessible surface area (DASA) (15) of 1299 )2. The calculated shape correlation statistic (Sc) for this interface is 0.60, indicating that it has a surface complementarity similar to that observed for cork-barrel interfaces of TonBdependent OM receptors (16). The TonB-FhuA interface is composed of a network of 17-residue pairs bound by hydrophilic interactions (table S2). All pairs were observed to have well-defined electron density for both FhuA and TonB side chains. Within this interface, a single electrostatic interaction occurs between FhuA cork residue Glu56 and TonB Arg166, located on TonB a1 (Fig. 3). A hydrogen bond is also formed between TonB Arg166 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of FhuA Ala26, located in the switch helix region. Ferrichrome binding to FhuA was previously observed to result in a 17.3 ) translocation of the FhuA N terminus and unwinding of the switch helix (9). Therefore, it appears that unwinding of the FhuA switch helix upon ligand binding occurs in order to stabilize FhuA interactions with TonB Arg166. FhuA barrel residues Ala591 and Asn594, located in or near periplasmic turn 8, also form hydrogen bonds with TonB Arg166. What does the crystal structure of the TonBFhuA complex tell us about interactions of TonB with a cognate OM receptor and the transport of metal-chelated siderophore? Given our structural data, combined with findings from previous studies of TonB interactions with OM receptors in vitro and in vivo, we propose that the interprotein b sheet formed between the receptor Ton box and the TonB C-terminal domain is required to position TonB helix a1 proximal to the receptor cork domain. In the TonB-FhuA structure, this results in TonB Arg166 forming an electrostatic interaction with FhuA cork residue Glu56. Both TonB Arg166 (17) and FhuA Glu56 located in the TEE motif (16) are highly conserved residues, predicting functional importance of this TonB-FhuA ionic interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations of FhuA have suggested that cork domain solvation may lower the energy barrier for active transport of ferrichrome (18). It has recently been proposed that hydration of the central b sheet of the cork domain may render it prone to disruption by TonB through transmission of a relatively small force perpendicularly applied to the b strands of the cork domain (16). Given its position proximal to the central b sheet of the FhuA cork domain, TonB Arg166 is positioned to mediate a mechanical shearing or pulling force applied in trans to the central b sheet of the cork domain, resulting in its disruption. Localized unfolding of the cork domain would allow siderophore translocation into the periplasm, facilitating subsequent steps of the siderophore transport cycle.

One key prediction is that as the density of animals in the group increases, a rapid transition occurs from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion. Understanding such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information.
