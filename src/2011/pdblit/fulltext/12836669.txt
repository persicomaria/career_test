Key words: epsin, ENTH domain, endocytosis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), solution structure

Abstract Epsin is a protein that binds to the Eps15 homology (EH) domains, and is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain (about 140 amino acid residues) is well conserved in eukaryotes and is considered to be important for actin cytoskeleton organization in endocytosis. In this study, we have determined the solution structure of the ENTH domain (residues 1­144) of human epsin by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the ENTH-domain structure, seven -helices form a superhelical fold, consisting of two antiparallel two-helix HEAT motifs and one three-helix ARM motif, with a continuous hydrophobic core in the center. We conclude that the seven-helix superhelical fold defines the ENTH domain, and that the previously-reported eight-helix fold of a longer fragment of rat epsin 1 is divided into the authentic ENTH domain and a C-terminal flanking -helix. Abbreviations: ENTH ­ epsin N-terminal homology; epsin ­ Eps15-interacting protein; EH ­ Eps15 homology; POB1 ­ partner of RalBP1; VHS ­ (VPS-27, Hrs, and STAM); HSQC ­ heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NMR ­ nuclear magnetic resonance; NOE ­ nuclear Overhauser enhancement; NOESY ­ NOE spectroscopy; TOCSY ­ total correlated spectroscopy Introduction Epsin was identified as a protein that binds to the Eps15 homology (EH) domains of Eps15, intersectin, and POB1, and is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis [1-5]. The C-terminal region of epsin contains three Asn­Pro­Phe (NPF) motifs, which interact with the EH domains [1, 4]. The central region of epsin contains multiple copies of the Asp­Pro­Trp (DPW) motif, and interacts with the -adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 [1]. In addition, there are fiveand seven-residue clathrin-binding motifs in the Cterminal and central regions, respectively, of epsin [6]. The N-terminal region of epsin is well conserved in a number of eukaryotic proteins, from yeast to mammals [1]. Kay et al. [7] found that about 140 amino acid residues at the N-terminus are highly conserved, and named this region the epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain. Genetic studies of the yeast homologues of epsin showed that this domain is essential for endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton organization [8]. Recently, the crystal structure of a rat epsin 1 fragment (residues 1­160) including the ENTH domain was reported [9]. This fragment apparently forms a compact globular domain with eight -helices, and was therefore redefined as the ENTH domain of rat epsin 1 [9], although the amino-acid sequence of this

2 C-terminal -helical region is less conserved than that of the originally-defined ENTH domain. The region corresponding to the originally-defined ENTH domain contains seven -helices. These -helices are arranged into three helical hairpin repeats (-helices 1­2, 3­4, and 5­7), which constitute a characteristic superhelical fold. By contrast, the additional C-terminal region forms -helix 8 (residues 136­156), which is tethered on the side of the superhelical fold through only a few polar interactions. These data indicate that the ENTH domain is defined by the N-terminal seven-helix superhelical fold, rather than the extended eight-helix fold. On the other hand, the crystal structures of the VHS (VPS-27, Hrs, and STAM) domains of Drosophila melanogaster Hrs and human Tom1 have also been reported [10, 11]. The VHS domaincontaining proteins are involved in endocytosis, vesicular transport, and/or signal transduction [12, 13]. The VHS domain structure has eight helices, which form a seven-helix superhelical fold in a manner similar to that of the epsin ENTH domain, and the C-terminal helix 8 [10, 11]. Intriguingly, the location of the eighth -helix on the superhelical fold in the VHS domain is different from that in the rat epsin 1 fragment. In this study, we prepared a protein sample of the ENTH domain (residues 1­144) of human epsin, according to the original definition by Kay et al. [7], and determined its solution structure using heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. This fragment lacks three fifths of the region corresponding to the C-terminal flanking helical part of the rat epsin 1 fragment structure [9]. The present authentic ENTH domain (residues 1­144) exhibited the seven-helix superhelical fold, which was superimposable onto that of the rat epsin 1 ENTH domain, in the absence of the C-terminal flanking region. These results indicate that the superhelical fold composed of the N-terminal seven -helices is the fundamental fold of the ENTH domain. the expression vector are added to the N-terminus of the epsin ENTH domain. Escherichia coli strain BL21 was transformed with this plasmid, and was grown at 30  C in M9 minimal media supplemented with MgSO4 (3 mM), CaCl2 (300 µM), trace element solution, vitamin solution, and ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). For the uniformly 15 N- and 15 N/13 C-labeled proteins, 15 NH4 Cl (1 g/l) and/or [13 C6 ] D-glucose (3 g/l) were used as the sole nitrogen and/or carbon sources in the growth media. Harvested cells were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM PMSF, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and were disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. The bound proteins were eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 14 mM glutathione (Sigma), and fractions containing the fusion protein were concentrated with a Centriprep-10 unit (Amicon). The fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin (Sigma and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 25  C. The digestion mixture was diluted 2-fold with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT, and then was applied to a Resource S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. The bound protein was eluted with an NaCl gradient (150­500 mM), and the fractions containing the ENTH domain were concentrated with a Centricon-10 unit (Amicon). The purity of the ENTH domain was judged to be over 95% from an SDS­ PAGE analysis, and the molecular weight observed from mass spectrometry was identical to the calculated value. The concentration of the ENTH domain for NMR analyses was 1.0 mM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 400 mM NaCl, 2 mM 2 H DTT, 0.01% sodium azide, and 10% 2 H O. 10 2 NMR spectroscopy NMR experiments were performed at 303 K on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer. The 2D 1 H-15N HSQC [14], 3D 15 N-edited TOCSY-HSQC [15], 15 Nedited NOESY-HSQC [16], and HNHB [17] spectra were recorded on the 15 N-labeled sample. The 2D 1 H-13 C HSQC [14], 3D HNCA [18], HN(CO)CA [19], HNCO [18], HCACO [18], CBCANH [20],

Materials and methods Protein expression and purification The human epsin ENTH domain (residues 1­144) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein using the pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In this construct, four residues (Gly, Ser, Ser, and Arg) derived from

3 CBCA(CO)NH [21], HBHA(CO)NH [22], C(CO)NH [23], H(CCO)HN [23], HCCH-TOCSY [24], HCCHCOSY [25], 13 C-edited NOESY-HSQC [26], 4D 13 C/15 N-edited NOESY [27], and 13 C/13 C-edited NOESY [28] spectra were also recorded on the 13 C/15 N-labeled sample. All spectra were processed on Octane and Origin2000 workstations (SGI), using the program NMRPipe [29]. Analyses of the processed data were performed with the NMRView software [30]. The AutoAssign program was used for the backbone resonance assignment [31]. Distance and Dihedral angle restraints Based on the NOE intensities, the interproton distance restraints, obtained from the 3D 15 N-edited NOESY-HSQC, 13 C-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 4D 13 C/13 C-edited NOESY spectra, were classified into upper bound distance restraints of 2.9, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 Å for the NOEs from the 15 N-edited NOESYHSQC spectrum, and 2.7, 3.3, 4.5, and 5.5 Å for the NOEs from the 13 C-edited NOESY-HSQC and 4D 13 C/13 C-edited NOESY spectra. The lower bounds for the interproton distance restraints were set to 1.8 Å. Distances involving methyl groups, aromatic ring protons, and non-stereospecifically assigned methylene protons were represented using r-6 averaging [32]. No pseudoatom correction was applied to distance bounds involving non-stereospecifically assigned protons. The backbone hydrogen bond restraints were given for the residues in the secondary structure elements on the basis of the absence of cross-peaks between NH and H2 O in the 3D 15 N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum measured by the water flip-back method. The upper and lower limits of the constraints for N­O were 3.5 and 2.5 Å, respectively, and those for NH­O were 2.5 and 1.5 Å, respectively. The  and  dihedral angle restraints were also given for the residues that are involved in the secondary structure elements determined by the NOE connectivities, and moreover have consistent 13 C chemical shift indices [33]. In the helical regions, the  and  angles were restrained to -65 and to -40 with allowed ranges of ±30, respectively. Structure calculations The structure of the ENTH domain was calculated with the program X-PLOR 3.1, using the simulated annealing protocol [32]. The final structure calculation was based on a total of 1034 restraints: 828 interproton distance restraints, 70 distance restraints for 35 backbone hydrogen bonds, and 136 dihedral angle restraints of 68  and 68 .

Results and discussion Structure determination The sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments were acquired by the AutoAssign program [31], using data from the 3D HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HCACO, 15 Nedited NOESY-HSQC, and 15 N-edited TOCSY-HSQC spectra. Of the 146 expected backbone amide resonances, 139 were observed in the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum of the epsin ENTH domain. The missing peaks are those of the N-terminal unstructured region (Gly(-3), Ser(-2) and Asn16) and of the loop region (Asn30, Asp31, Ser36, and Ser37). The aliphatic resonance assignments were obtained from the 3D 15 Nedited TOCSY-HSQC, HBHA(CO)NH, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)HN, HCCH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, and 13 Cedited NOESY-HSQC spectra, while the aromatic resonance assignments were obtained from the 3D HCCH-COSY and 13 C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. The secondary structure of the human epsin ENTH domain was determined on the basis of the NOE connectivities observed in the 3D 15 N-edited, 13 C-edited, and 4D 13 C/13 C-edited NOESY spectra. The sequential and medium-range NOEs, the backbone hydrogen bonds, and the 13 C chemical shift indices are summarized in Figure 1. The secondary structure of the epsin ENTH domain consists of seven -helices. The three-dimensional structure of the epsin ENTH domain was determined from a total of 1034 restraints. A summary of the structural statistics for the 20 final structures is provided in Table 1. These structures satisfy the distance and dihedral angle restraints with no violations greater than 0.3 Å and no dihedral violations greater than 3 , respectively. Figure 2 shows the structures aligned by superimposing the backbone atoms (N, C , and C ) of the secondary structure elements. The average root-mean-square (rms) deviation was 0.34 (± 0.17) Å for the backbone atoms of the secondary structure elements (Table 1). A ribbon representation of the three-dimensional structure of the human epsin ENTH domain is shown in Figure 3. The structure consists of seven -helices that form three tandem stacking repeats; repeat 1 (1­ 2) and repeat 2 (3­4) each form a two-helix hairpin, and repeat 3 (5­7) forms a three-helix hairpin

Figure 1. Diagram of the sequential- and medium-range NOE connectivities, the backbone hydrogen bonds, and the 13 C chemical shift indices. The height of the bars reflects the strength of the NOE correlation, as strong, medium, weak, or very weak. The NOE connectivities that could not be established unambiguously because of overlaps are marked by open boxes (dNN and dN) or dashed lines (dN and d). The residues that lacked a cross-peak between the HN and H2 O resonances in the 3D 1 H-15 N NOESY-HSQC spectrum are indicated by . The well conserved hydrophobic-core residues are colored in green. The residues that are highly conserved among ENTH domains but are not involved in the hydrophobic core, are colored in red.

(Figure 3). The helices of each repeat make hydrophobic interactions, and the stacking of these repeats forms the superhelical fold, which includes a continuous hydrophobic core in the center. The residues involved in this hydrophobic core are well conserved among the ENTH domains, indicating the conservation of this topology (Figure 1). In this topology, the two short loops (loops between helices 2 and 3 and between helices 4 and 5) that connect the three repeats

exist on one side of the structure, whereas the three loops (loops between helices 1 and 2, between helices 3 and 4, and between helices 6 and 7) connecting the helices of each repeat constitute the opposite side. These two sides include most of the highly conserved residues that are not involved in the hydrophobic core, indicating their biological importance (Figures 1 and 3).

tables have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (BMRB-4959). Comparison with the crystal structure of the rat epsin 1 ENTH domain Recently, the crystal structure of a fragment of rat epsin 1 was reported. The crystal structure of the fragment (residues 1­160) including the rat epsin 1 ENTH domain [9] is very similar to the solution structure of the human epsin ENTH domain: the amino acid sequences of both domains (residues 1 to 144) are the same, and the rms difference of the backbone C atoms is 1.00 Å when the C atoms of the secondary structure elements of the rat epsin ENTH domain are superimposed onto those of the human epsin ENTH domain (Figure 4). On the other hand, the eighth helix (136­156) follows the C-terminus of the ENTH domain, in the case of the crystal structure. This helix is tethered on the side of the superhelical fold through only a few polar interactions, and is not involved in the hydrophobic core of the domain. In our case, the protein retains the superhelical fold, although about three fifths of this eighth region are deleted and the remaining two fifths are disordered. These results indicate that only the superhelical fold is essential for the ENTH domain, and the eighth helix is distinct from the ENTH domain. Comparison of the structure of the human epsin ENTH domain with those of other domains We compared the structure of the human epsin ENTH domain with those of other proteins. The two-helix

and three-helix hairpins of the epsin ENTH domain are structurally similar to the HEAT repeat and the armadillo (ARM) repeat, respectively. The HEAT repeat is found in proteins like the PR65/A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase  [34, 35]. On the other hand, the armadillo repeat is found in proteins like -catenin and karyopherin  [36, 37]. Both repeats are contiguously stacked, and form superhelical structures. Recently, the crystal structures of the VHS domains of Drosophila Hrs and human Tom1 have been reported [10, 11]. The VHS domain contains eight helices, and its seven-helix superhelical structure is very similar to that of the ENTH domain, in spite of the low sequence homology between these two domains (Figure 5). The rms difference of the backbone C atoms is 1.74 Å when the C atoms of the ENTH domain secondary structure elements are superimposed onto those of the Hrs VHS domain. In the case of the VHS domain, an additional -helix (8) exists at the C-terminus, and is bound to 6 and 7 of the third hairpin. Although the crystal structure of the rat epsin 1 fragment (residues 1­160) including the ENTH domain also has an additional -helix (8) at the C-terminus, this helix is bound to a surface region that is different from that of the VHS domain (Figures 4 and 5). These data suggest

7 that the common superhelical fold composed of seven helices is essential for these two domains. Biological implications The high similarity of the structure of the ENTH domain with that of the VHS domain indicates that some functional similarities may exist among these domains. The ENTH domain has been reported to be necessary for endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton structure [8]. On the other hand, the VHS domain is found in proteins involved in endocytosis and/or vesicular traffic [12]. Moreover, both domains are generally localized at the N-terminus of proteins, and some other protein­protein and/or protein­lipid interacting motifs exist in the C-terminal regions of these proteins. These data indicate that the seven-helix superhelical structure is one of the general folds involved in endocytosis, and plays some similar role in the function of each protein. In the case of the VHS domain, several VHS domain-containing proteins are localized to cellular membranes. The N-terminal region of EAST, including the VHS domain, can localize to the plasma membrane [38]. In addition, the VHS domain of Vear shows widespread membrane localization when overexpressed in COS-7 cells [39]. Thus, the VHS domain may interact with membranes and/or other membrane-associated proteins to localize the VHS domain-containing proteins. Previous studies reported that some ENTH domain-containing proteins are also localized to the membrane [1, 8]. These data indicate that, like the VHS domain, the ENTH domain also interacts with the membrane directly and/or other membrane-associated proteins in order to localize the ENTH domain-containing proteins. Several highly conserved basic residues are clustered on the surface region involving loop1 (loop between 1 and 2), 3, and 4 (Figure 1). The conserved positively-charged region is characteristic of phospholipid-binding domains, such as the PH (pleckstrin homology) and FYVE (Fab1p, YOTB, Vac1p, and EEA1) domains [40], suggesting that the ENTH domain also binds phospholipids in the membrane. In fact, we just recently found that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is strongly bound to this basic region on the surface of the epsin ENTH domain, and this interaction is necessary for clathrinmediated endocytosis [41]. This region is far from the eighth helix (8), suggesting that 8 is not involved in the molecular function of the ENTH domain. On the other hand, Hyman et al. recently reported that the epsin ENTH domain interacts with the transcription factor, promyelocytic leukemia Zn2+ finger protein (PLZF) [9]. This report shows that epsin may be involved not only in endocytosis but also in nuclear function. Further experiments will reveal the molecular mechanism for the regulation of cellular functions by the ENTH domain.
