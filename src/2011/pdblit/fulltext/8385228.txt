Crystallographic Study of Elongation Factor G from Thermus thermophilus I-IB8
Crystals of elongation factor G with a molecular mass of about 76,000 from Thermus thermophilus HB8 were grown. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions: a = 76-2 A, b - 107-6 A and c -- 117-1 A. The assumed number of protein molecules per asymmetric part of a unit cell is one. Polypeptide chain elongation factor G (EF-G) is a large monomeric protein. In the process of biosynthesis, EF-G promotes the translocation of the peptidyltRNA. mRNA complex from the A to the P site on the ribosome (Lucas-Lenard & Lipmann, 1971). Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of EF-G could ~c~vid,e an ~nde~standi~g of the mechanism 0.f EF-G binding with nucleotides and ribosome. FactQ r G from Escherichia coli has been crystallize~ by I~aziro & !notre (1968) but large crystals suitable for X-ray analysis have not been obtained. The large tryptic N and C-terminal fragments of EF-G from E. coli have been crystallized by us recently (Reshetnikova et al., 1982). However, the large crystals obtained did not have a good radiation stability. In this letter we report preliminary data on the crystallographic study of elongation factor G isolated from the thermophilic bacteria Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TEF-G). I t has a molecular mass of about 76,000 as estimated by us with the use of gel electrophore~is. The factors TEF-G and EF-G from E. coli have similar catalytic and molecular properties (Arai et al., 1978a,b; Nakamura et al., 1978). The isolation of TEF-G was carried out as described by Garber & Reshetnikova (1982). During this procedure the protein molecule undergoes some proteolytic modification. The polypeptide chain breaks at a distance of about l0 to 15 amino acid residues from the N-terminal end and the modified factor retains its biological activity. The native and modified forms of TEF-G seem to be very si~mi!ar: Practically the same crystals have been obtained from a homogeneous modified form of TEF-G as well as from a mixture of native and m o,~ified fpros: Crystals were grown by the hanging drop microdiffusion technique at 4°C. A drop of T]~F-G solution at a concentration of 10mg/ml in 20mM-imidasol.HC1 (pH 7"8), 3 raM-sodium azide was equilibrated with 20% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4pentanediol as a precipitant. The crystals were grown for three weeks arid had dimensions of about 0"5 mm × 0-5 m m × 0-15 mm. Other details are described by Reshetnikova & Garber (1983). X-ray diffraction measuremen.ts were carried out on an Elliott GX-6 rotating anode generator operated at 35 kV and 35 mA. The size of the focal spot was 0-2 mm × 0-2 mm. Precession photographs were taken with a Nonius camera. Unit cell dimensions taken from the photographs were increased by 0-15% due to film 449 0022-2836/83/220449-02 $03.00/0 © 1983 AcademicPress Inc. (London)Ltd.

shrinkage. The root-mean-square errors of the unit cell dimension measurements were no worse than 0"25~/o as calculated from several precession photographs. The analysis of diffraction p a t t e r n s y m m e t r y was done from precession photographs of the main zones a t a b o u t 5 A resolution. The crystals displayed a diffraction limit up to 4 A during 30 to 40 hours at 18°C. The crystals belong to space group P212121 as seen from the absences along three orthogonal axes observed in the zones hko, okl and hkh. In addition a 2-fold screw pseudo-axis was found along the diagonal direction [101] of a unit cell. The absences along this direction were observed to a b o u t 6"5 A resolution. According to the s y m m e t r y of the given space group the unit cell has four asymmetric parts. We can estimate the n u m b e r of molecules in the unit cell using volume packing p a r a m e t e r Vm = V,,it~l]nM, where V is the volume, n is the n u m b e r of molecules in the unit cell and M is the molecular mass of a protein molecule (Matthews, 1968). For a large n u m b e r of proteins the Vm value for their crystals varied from 1-68 to 3"53 A3/dalton; the most frequently occurring value was 2"15 A.3/dalton. F o r T E F - G crystals the possible n u m b e r of molecules in the unit cell is assumed to be four or eight. In these cases the Vm value is 3"08 and 1-54 A3/dalton, respectively. Therefore, the assumed n u m b e r of protein molecules in the unit cell appears to be four and the asymmetric part of the unit cell contains one molecule. Taking into account a low resolution non-crystallographic s y m m e t r y along the diagonal [101] in the xoz plane we can suppose the internal molecular s y m m e t r y is supplied by the 2-fold screw pseudo-axis. Therefore, a molecule of T E F - G seems to consist of two semi-equal domains. An X - r a y crystal structure analysis of T E F - G is now in progress.
