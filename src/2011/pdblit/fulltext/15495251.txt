Hemoglobin (Hb) Bassett, an abnormal Hb variant with a markedly reduced oxygen affinity, was discovered in a Caucasian (Anglo-Saxon) male child who experienced episodes of cyanosis. Cation-exchange and reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the patient has an abnormal Hb, with a mutation in the a-globin. Tryptic peptide digest of the abnormal a-globin with subsequent HPLC analysis revealed abnormal elution of the a-T11 peptide. Further studies with Edman sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry of tryptic peptide a-T11, as well as structural analysis by X-ray crystallography revealed an AspfiAla substitution at the a94 (G1) position, a match for Hb Bassett. Detailed functional studies showed that this Hb variant had a markedly reduced oxygen affinity (P50 at pH 7.0 = 22 mmHg; Hb A P50 = 10.5 mmHg), reduced Bohr effect (-0.26 compared to - 0.54 in Hb A), and low subunit cooperativity (n = 1.4, compared to 2.6 in Hb A). X-ray crystallography results explain the probable effects of the structural modification on the oxygen-binding properties of this Hb variant. Am. J. Hematol. 77:268­276, 2004.

INTRODUCTION

Most of the currently documented a-globin mutations in human hemoglobin (Hb) do not affect the oxygen affinity of Hb because the mutation site may be remote from amino acid groups that are crucial in the interactions between globin and heme or between aand b-globin subunits [1]. However, in some Hb variants, the a-globin mutation leads to significant changes in their properties. All of these a-globin-mutated Hb variants have amino acid substitutions at the crucial contact regions which have bonds that stabilize oxy(relaxed or R) and deoxy- (tense, or T) forms of Hb and, hence, are crucial for allosterism. The amino acids at the a1:b2 interface, for instance, play a major role in the transformation of Hb between the deoxy and the

oxy states and in the dissociation of Hb into dimers. Most mutations in the a1:b2 interface cause either an increase or a decrease in oxygen affinity, leading to polycythemia or anemia, methemoglobinemia, cyanosis, tissue hypoxia, and respiratory distress [2­11]. We report here an abnormal Hb with a very low oxygen affinity found in a 6-year-old Caucasian male.

Hb Bassett With Low O2 Affinity

269

The proband appeared cyanotic in the early newborn period and had rare episodes subsequently. While measurements of oxygen saturation have remained low ($90%), normal arterial pO2 values have been noted in the past. He has been only marginally anemic with a Hb level of 11.9 g/dL at age 6 years. Reticulocyte counts have remained slightly elevated (2.9%). The existence of an abnormal Hb with a low oxygen affinity, specifically Hb with an a-globin mutation was suspected, because the cyanosis existed before the replacement of the g-globin chain by the b-globin chain [``switch'' from fetal Hb (Hb F) to adult Hb (Hb A)] and persisted after the replacement. The result of amino acid analysis showed that this Hb variant has the same amino acid substitution as Hb Bassett, which was reported by Fairbanks in a personal communication [12]. However, detailed functional and structural studies were not performed on this Hb variant. In this paper, we describe the identification and various properties of Hb Bassett (a94Asp!Ala). From the results of the X-ray crystallographic analyses of both the T and R states of Hb Bassett, the molecular mechanism involved in the aforementioned mutant functional properties is proposed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of the Hemolysate

Instruments, Inc., San Jose, CA) using a weak cationexchange column (SwiftTM WCX-PEEK: 50 mm Â 4.6 mm, Isco, Inc., Lincoln, NE) and eluted with a linear gradient of phase B from 10% to 60% in 10 min at 220 nm (mobile phase A, 50 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM potassium cyanide pH 6.0; phase B, 50 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM potassium cyanide, 0.5 M sodium chloride, pH 6.0). Twenty microliters (about 50 mg of Hb) of the hemolysate dissolved in mobile phase A was applied to the column. AFSC or FASC (hemoglobin standards containing approximately equal amounts of Hb A, Hb F, Hb S, and Hb C) was used as a control for the HPLC analysis.
Purification of the Hemoglobin Variant

After washing the cell fraction of whole blood sample from the patient (collected in EDTA tubes) three times with isotonic saline by centrifugation at 15,000g at 4 C for 2 min and removal of the buffy coat, hemolysate was prepared by lysing the red blood cells (RBCs) in a hypotonic hemolysing solution [13]. To remove the stroma (RBC ghosts) efficiently, 1/10 volume of 10% NaCl was added followed by centrifugation at 15,000g at 4 C for 10 min.
Globin Chain Separation

To separate the patient's globin chains, hemolysate was analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (DX 500, Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) using a MicrosorbMVTM C4 column (4.6 mm Â 250 mm, 5 mm, Rainin Instruments Company, Inc., Woburn, MA), with a gradient from 60% to 80% of phase B, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min in 40 min (phase A ¼ 20% acetonitrile, 0.3% TFA in water; phase B ¼ 60% acetonitrile, 0.3% TFA in water) and at an absorbance of 214 nm. A diluted solution (50 mL) of hemolysate (about 120 mg of Hb) was loaded on the column.
Hemoglobin Variant Analysis

The hemoglobin variant was separated from total Hb with a CM Sephadex C-50 column using a linear gradient from 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, to 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0. Approximately 50 mL of a diluted solution of the hemolysate containing Hb Bassett (1 g/dL total Hb) was dialyzed against two buffer changes of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 at 4 C, and loaded on the column, which had been previously equilibrated with the same buffer. Separation was performed at 4 C. The separated fractions were collected in test tubes, and the absorbance of one of the oxyhemoglobin peaks (A576nm) was measured spectrophotometrically, and values were plotted. Fractions containing the Hb variant were pooled, adjusted to pH 7.4 and concentrated with an Amicon Model 8050 ultrafiltration cell (W.R. Grace & Co., Cambridge, MA) using Diaflo YM10 ultrafiltration membranes (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). Aliquots (0.5 mL) were frozen and stored at À80 C. To separate the a- and b-globins, the concentrated stock solution was subjected to RP-HPLC as described previously. The a-globin fraction was collected from several HPLC runs, pooled, lyophilized, and consequently subjected to tryptic digestion. The same procedure was performed on normal a-globin from control Hb A. Alkaline cellulose acetate electrophoresis (at pH 8.6) was performed on both the total Hb and the purified fraction of the Hb variant according to the manufacturer's recommended methods (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX), in order to study and compare their migration patterns to those of Hb A, Hb F, and sickle hemoglobin (Hb S).
Determination of Hemoglobin Oxygen Equilibrium Curve

The hemolysate was also analyzed for Hb variants by cation-exchange HPLC (Hitachi 7000 Series, Hitachi

Oxygen equilibrium curves (OECs) of the proband's hemolysate, the purified Hb variant, and Hb A were determined with a HemoxTM Analyzer (TCS

The effects of organic phosphates on the oxygen affinity of this Hb variant were studied by measuring the P50 value (the oxygen pressure at which 50% of Hb molecules are in the oxy or deoxy form) in the presence of 2 mM 2,3-DPG (2,3-diphosphoglycerate) and 2 mM inositol hexaphosphate (IHP, phytic acid).
Hemoglobin Stability

RP-HPLC runs for isolation and collection of peptides for further analysis.
Identification of the Amino Acid Substitution

The stability of the Hb variant was studied using the mechanical shake test as described by Asakura et al. [16,17]. Hb A and Hb S were used as stable and unstable Hb controls, respectively. The Hb solutions were diluted in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to obtain a concentration of about 35 mM (A576nm $ 0.5). One milliliter of each of the samples (Hb Bassett, Hb A, and Hb S) was then subjected to mechanical shaking using a Hemo-ShakeTM machine (TCS Scientific Corp.) in tightly sealed cuvettes at 30- and 60-sec intervals, followed by centrifugation at 7,000g at ambient temperature for 7 min after each shake cycle. Absorbance spectra were measured between 400 nm and 700 nm to verify that the spectrum type remained essentially the same (oxy-Hb). The absorbance at 576 nm was measured spectrophotometrically to determine the concentration of the remaining oxyhemoglobin in solution after each shake­centrifuge cycle. The absorbance values of the remaining Hb in solution at 576 nm were expressed in percentages, using the following formula: Remaining Hb ¼ ½A576nm after a in solution (%) shake-centrifuge cycle= initial A576nm  Â 100 The total shake time was 720 sec, and all measurements were carried out at room temperature.
Tryptic Digestion and Peptide Analysis

The abnormal tryptic peptide obtained from the HPLC peptide map was sent to local amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry laboratories along with the normal tryptic peptide obtained from Hb A. All mass spectrometry measurements were made on a VG Quattro II Triple Quadruple mass spectrometer with ESI source and Micromass Masslynx data system. The instrument was operated in positive ion mode. The mobile phase (5% acetic acid/ methanol, at 50:50 v/v) was introduced into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. Capillary and cone voltages were kept at 4.76 kV and 30 V, respectively, both multipliers at 650, low and high resolutions at 15.0, and source temperature at 100 C. Nitrogen was used as nebulizing gas. The amino acid sequences of the peptides (normal and mutant) were determined by the Edman degradation method [18,19], using a Beckman Model LF 3400 gas-phase protein sequencer (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA).
DNA Analyses

Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using a QIAampÒ DNA Blood Mini Kit 50 (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). The a-globin gene cluster was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using a common forward primer (50 -CGC GCT CGC GGC CCG GCA C-30 ) and reverse primers specific for a1 (50 -GGG GGG AGG CCC AAG GGG CAA GAA-30 ) and a2 (50 -GGG AGG CCC ATC GGG CAG GAG GAA C-30 ). PCR products were sequenced at the Core Facilities laboratory of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Structural Analysis of Hb Bassett by X-ray Crystallography

Solutions containing purified a-globins which had been prepared from Hb A or Hb Bassett were digested with trypsin (Sequencing Grade, Promega, Madison, WI), at a globin-to-trypsin ratio of 50:1 in 60 mM NH4CO3, pH 8.0, at 37 C for 24 hr. The resulting peptides were separated by RP-HPLC using a Vydac C-18 column (5 mm, 4.6 mm Â 250 mm, Bio-Rad Corporation, Hercules, CA) and were eluted in a 60-min linear gradient from 0% to 50% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Sufficient amounts of both a-Bassett and normal a-A globins were digested with trypsin to permit multiple

Crystals of the T and R states of the Hb variant were produced using high salt as described by Perutz [20]. The isomorphous native T (PDB code 2HHB) and R (PDB code 1AJ9) state Hb structures were used as starting models to refine the mutant T- and R-state Hb structures, respectively. Refinement converged to final Rfactor/Rfree of 18.3/23.6% and 21.8/ 28.1% for the T- and R-state Hb variant structures, ° at resolutions of 1.80 and 2.15 A, respectively. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession code 1R1Y and 1R1X for the T- and R-state Hb variant structures, respectively.

RESULTS Hb Analyses

Functional Studies

RP-HPLC analysis of Hb A showed approximately equal amounts of a- and b-globin peaks. The proband's hemolysate showed an abnormal peak eluting as a shoulder of the normal a-globin peak. The b-globin was eluted as a single peak both in Hb A and in the proband's Hb. This result indicated that the abnormality in the proband's Hb is in the a-globin. In the cation-exchange HPLC, Hb Bassett eluted between Hb S and Hb C (Fig. 1). The proband's hemolysate contained approximately 30% abnormal Hb. Purification of a large quantity of the abnormal Hb was achieved by CM-Sephadex column chromatography. Hb Bassett was eluted at a pH near 8.0. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis of the proband's Hb revealed an abnormal Hb band migrating between the bands of Hb F and Hb S. The isolated Hb Bassett migrated to the same position as this abnormal band.

The oxygen equilibrium curves of Hb A and Hb Bassett were studied and compared. The OEC of Hb Bassett is significantly right-shifted compared with the OEC of Hb A (Fig. 2). Interestingly, even at pO2 ¼ 500 mmHg, Hb Bassett was not completely saturated with oxygen as evidenced by the hyperbolic shape of the OEC. Hb Bassett had lower subunit cooperativity (heme­heme interaction) than Hb A, as evidenced by the low Hill's coefficient of 1.4 (that for Hb A is 2.6). As shown in Table I, Hb Bassett has a low oxygen affinity and a very small Bohr effect [Dlog P50/DpH between pH 6.5 and 8.0 ¼ À0.26, compared to a value of À0.54 for Hb A]. At pH 7.0, the degree of the effect of 2,3-DPG on the position of the OEC of Hb A and Hb Bassett are almost equal (1.3- and 1.4-fold increase in the P50 values, respectively). However, inositol hexaphosphate had a significantly smaller effect on the position of OEC of Hb Bassett (1.7-fold increase in P50 value), than on that of Hb A (about 7-fold increase) (Table I). Comparison of the stability of Hb Bassett, Hb A, and Hb S by the mechanical shake method showed that the oxy form of Hb Bassett was slightly more unstable than oxy-Hb A but that it was more stable than oxy-Hb S. It is noteworthy that the remaining Hb in the supernatant solution after being subjected to mechanical shaking had essentially the same type of spectrum as that of the original Hb solution. Neither methemoglobin nor hemichrome was formed.
Structural Studies

RP-HPLC of the tryptic digests of a-Bassett and normal a- globin showed that only the tryptic peptide a-T11 was eluted differently from that of normal a-A globin. The normal and mutant a-T11 tryptic peptides were collected for Edman sequencing and electrospray mass

spectrometry (ES-MS), and a substitution of Asp!Ala at a94 (G1) was found in the mutant a-globin. When subjected to mass spectrometry, the normal peptide had an m/z ratio of 818.6, while the mutant peptide had an m/z ratio of 774.5. After correction for hydrogen, the difference was 43 u, which corresponds to the difference in mass between Asp and Ala, hence confirming the results obtained from Edman sequencing. DNA sequencing revealed a single base substitution at codon 94 of the a1-globin gene (GAC!GCC). This result confirms the substitution of Asp!Ala at a94 which was identified in the protein studies. The three-dimensional structures of both the T and R states of native Hb A and Hb Bassett were studied at ° 1.80 and 2.15 A resolution, respectively. The two Hb variant structures (T and R state) were compared with ° the high-salt 1.74-A deoxygenated T-state (2HHB) and ° carbonmonoxy R-state (1AJ9) Hb structures. 2.2-A Figures 3A and 3B show stereoviews of the a1:b2 Hb dimer interfaces of the Hb variant structures superimposed on their respective native T- and R-state Hb structures. It is clear from Fig. 3A that the a1:b2 interface of the T-state Hb structure was only slightly perturbed by the mutation. As expected, a hydrogen-bond interaction between a1Asp94 OD1 and b2Trp37 NE1 found in the native T-state Hb structure was absent in the mutant T-state Hb structure due to the substitution. In addition, a hydrogen bond between a1Arg92 O and ° b2Arg40 NE (3.3 A) found in the native T-state Hb structure, was replaced by a salt-bridge interaction ° between a1Arg92 NH2 and b2Glu43 OE2 (3.0 A) in the mutant T-state Hb structure. The difference in the a1Arg92 interaction is most likely due to the flexibility of the side chains of aArg40 and bGlu43, and not a consequence of the mutation, as other high-resolution T-state Hb structures (1A3N, 1BZ0 and 1THB, 1LJW) also show variations in interactions involving aArg92. In all, seven hydrogen-bond and salt-bridge interactions were found at the a1:b2 interface of the native T-state Hb structure, compared to six in the mutant T-state Hb structure. There were a total of ten water-mediated hydrogen-bond interactions across the a1:b2 interface

in both the native and mutant T-state Hb structures; eight of them were conserved, while two were unique to each structure. However, the mutant R-state Hb structure revealed significant structural changes at the a1:b2 subunit interface (Fig. 3B). Even though the mutation was located in the a chain, the largest structural change in the mutant R-state Hb structure occurred in the b chain, where there was significant rearrangement of the bFG-corner (residues bVal98­bAsn102), which had shifted closer to the aC-helix. The b2Asp99 residue had moved almost ° 2.2 A to make two unique hydrogen-bond interactions in the Hb variant structure: b2Asp99 OD2 to a1Tyr42 ° ° OH (2.9 A) and b2Asp99 OD1 to a1Asn97 ND2 (3.0 A). These two hydrogen-bond interactions are absent in the native R-state Hb structure but interestingly are found in the native T-state Hb structure. As expected, the substitution abolished two inter-subunit hydrogenbond interactions involving aAsp94 that are found in the native R-state Hb structure, including a1Asp94 OD1 to b2Trp37 NE1 and a1Asp94 OD2 to b2Asn102 ND2. Also absent in the mutant R-state Hb structure, but present in the native R-state Hb structure, are the hydrogen-bond interactions involving a1Thr38 OH to b2His97 O and a1Leu91 O to b2Arg40 NE. The interaction between a1Thr38 OH and b2His97 O was in fact substituted by a unique water-mediated hydrogenbond interaction between a1Thr38 O and b2Asn97 O. A similar loss of hydrogen-bond interaction between a1Thr38 and b2His97 has been reported in a recently published native R-state carbonmonoxy Hb structure [21], suggesting that the structure is in the process of initiating the allosteric transition to the T state. Interestingly, like the mutant R-state Hb structure, the native T-state Hb structure lacks the hydrogen-bond interaction between a1Thr38 and b2His97 and between a1Asp94 and b2Asn102. It thus seems that the a1:b2 packing interface of the mutant R-state Hb displays some T-state characteristics. Another important difference between the native and the mutant R-state Hb structures was the presence of three important water-mediated hydrogen-bond interactions

found across the a1:b2 dimer interface of the native Hb structure (two of them involving a1Asp94), that are absent in the Hb variant structure. In all, six direct and three water-mediated hydrogen-bond interactions were found at the a1:b2 interface of the native R-state Hb structure, compared with four and one, respectively, in the mutant R-state Hb structure.

DISCUSSION

Our investigations revealed a hemoglobin variant which matches the previously described Hb Bassett. However, detailed studies on this variant were not reported. Hb Bassett has an amino acid substitution (a94Asp!Ala) at the a1:b2 contact region, where the

274

Abdulmalik et al.

key conformational changes associated with oxygenation and deoxygenation of the Hb molecule take place. This dimer interface plays a major role in the allosteric activity of the Hb by forming an inter-subunit hydrogen bond/salt bridge that links and stabilizes the two ab dimers in both the T- and R-state Hb. It is, therefore, no surprise that substitution of aspartate to alanine causes significant effects on both the oxygen affinity and stability of this Hb variant. According to the allosteric model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (WMC) [22], the tetrameric Hb exists in equilibrium between two quaternary conformations: R (relaxed) and T (tense). Fully deoxygenated Hb is almost exclusively in the T state, while normal oxy-Hb exists in the R conformation. The transition between these two conformations involves a considerable free-energy change which is reflected as cooperativity between the subunits, or heme­heme interaction. One of the important changes that take place during this isomerization is rotation of the b chains relative to the a chains at the a1:b2 interface, leading to disruption and/or formation of new hydrogen-bond and salt-bridge interactions across the a1:b2 dimer interface. Also, when Hb dissociates into dimers, it does so across this contact region [23]. The T state has more hydrogen bond/salt bridges across the a1:b2 interface than the R state. Disruption of any of the a1:b2 interface bonds that stabilize the T state causes high oxygen affinity [24,25], and disruption of any bond that stabilizes the R-state Hb structure does the reverse. The inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interaction between a1Asp94 and b2Asn102 is very important for stabilizing the R conformation [5,6]; therefore, changes that negatively affect this bond are expected to reduce oxyhemoglobin stability, enhance dissociation into dimers, and, consequently, decrease oxygen affinity. The importance of this inter-subunit hydrogen bond has been illustrated

and described in Hb variants with amino acid substitutions in the b-globin [Hb Kansas (b102 (G4) Asn!Thr), ´ Hb Saint Mande (b102 (G4) Asn!Tyr)], and Hb variants with substitutions in the a-globin [Hb Setif (a94 Asp!Tyr), Hb Capa (a94 Asp!Gly), Hb Roanne ¸ (a94 Asp!Glu), Hb Sunshine Seth (a94 Asp!His), and Hb Titusville (a94 Asp!Asn)] (Table II). Most of the a-chain mutants with amino acid substitutions at this position show reduced oxygen affinities. Functional data are not available for Hb Sunshine Seth, while the fifth one, Hb Roanne, has increased oxygen affinity (Table II). Of the four described b-chain mutants with substitutions at this interface, two variants (Hb Beth Israel b102 Asn!Ser and Hb Richmond b102 Asn!Lys) have increased oxygen affinity [9,10], while the other two (Hb Kansas b102 (G4) Asn!Thr, and Hb ´ Saint Mande b102 (G4) Asn!Tyr) exhibit reduced oxygen affinity [7,11]. In Hb Bassett, replacement of the aspartate residue by alanine abolishes significant inter-subunit hydrogen bond interactions involving the aspartate, in accordance with Perutz's atomic model of oxyhemoglobin [26­28]. The reduced stability of Hb Bassett relative to normal Hb is obviously a consequence of the reduced inter-subunit interactions in both the T and R states of the Hb variant as a result of the substitution. Although there is apparent loss of inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions across the a1:b2 dimer interface in both the T and R states of the Hb variant, we expect the a1:b2 dimer interface of the R-state conformer to be more destabilized than that of the T-state conformer because of loss of a greater number of inter-subunit interactions in the R-state Hb. The allosteric equilibrium is therefore expected to favor the relatively stable T-state Hb variant, giving rise to the observed low oxygen affinity of this Hb variant. Supporting this conclusion is

the fact that the R-state in this Hb variant is characterized by a T-state a1:b2 interface packing, suggesting an R-state Hb structure with a subtle but significant gradation in the allosteric transition toward the T state. Interestingly, the presence of the three acidic residues, a1Asp94, b2Asp99, and b2Glu101, in close proximity to each other at the a1:b2 interface, may partially explain the observed functional properties of the Hb variant. In the normal T-state Hb, the carboxylate of a1Asp94 is at a dis° tance of 5.1 and 4.6 A from those of b2Asp99 and b2Glu101, respectively, compared to distances of 5.6 ° and 7.4 A, respectively, in the normal R-state Hb. The close proximity of the acidic residues in the T-state Hb should lead to greater electrostatic repulsion between them compared to that in the R-state Hb. Replacement of aAsp94 with aAla94 may therefore have a less deleterious effect on the T-state Hb than on the R-state Hb, leading to the observed functional properties. Based on the X-ray crystallographic results of the T- and R-state structures of the Hb variant, we offer explanations for the observed biological properties of the aAsp94x mutants listed in Table II. Substitution of aAsp94 to aGly94 should result in similar structural changes as observed for the aAsp94Ala, that is, greater loosening and destabilization of the R structure relative to the T structure, resulting in a shift of the allosteric equilibrium toward the low oxygen affinity T-state Hb. Substitution of aAsp94 to aAsn94 probably does not change the orientation of aAsn94; as such, it is expected that interactions similar to those of aAsp94 are maintained in both the T- and R-state Hb structures. On the other hand, the substituted aAsn94 should stabilize the T state by dramatically reducing or removing the destabilization effect of aAsp94 as described above. This may explain the low oxygen affinity observed in the aAsp94Asn mutant. Unlike the variants aAsp94Ala and aAsp94Gly, which are slightly unstable, aAsp94Asn is stable. This may be due to the fact that, unlike the aGly94 and aAla94 mutants, the inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions observed with aAsp94 in normal Hb A should still be maintained with aAsn94. Moreover, the T state should be stabilized to a greater degree by this substitution compared with the T state of aAsp94. Increasing the side-chain length in the a1Glu94 substitution would lead to an even greater electrostatic repulsion between the carboxylate of a1Glu94 and those of b2Asp99 and b2Glu101 in both the T and R states compared to that of aAsp94. This would weaken the a1:b2 inter-subunit interactions in both Hb states and explain why this mutant is slightly unstable. Overall, the destabilization effect would be greater in the T state than in the

R state and explains why this mutant has increased oxygen affinity. When aTyr94 was graphically modeled to replace aAsp94, it was found to be too bulky with unfavorable steric interactions at the a1:b2 interface. Therefore, unless the protein or the a1:b2 interface undergoes major rearrangement, aTyr94 should destabilize the Hb, and this explains why the mutant is unstable. The most characteristic functional property of Hb is its cooperative binding with oxygen. This unique property of Hb has important physiologic significance for both the binding of oxygen at the lungs and efficient release of oxygen at the tissues. The binding of oxygen to one heme progressively increases the affinity of the second, third, and fourth hemes. This cooperative binding of oxygen to Hb, which is caused by allosterism, is called heme­heme interaction [29]. This cooperativity is expressed as the n value (Hill's coefficient) from Hill's plot. A lower n value indicates a reduction in subunit cooperativity and hence, less efficient unloading of oxygen at the tissues. A reduced Hill's coefficient has been documented in Hb Kansas and Hb Titusville, among other low-affinity Hb variants. The Hill's coefficient of Hb Bassett was significantly smaller than that of native Hb A, suggesting reduced cooperativity. This is probably due to the weakened intersubunit interactions in Hb Bassett. Hemoglobin Rothschild (b37 Trp!Arg), which has a substitution at the a1:b2 interface, is also characterized by having low cooperativity, low oxygen affinity, and decreased stability of both the T and R states [30­ 33]. Other Hb variants with low cooperativity and low oxygen affinity have been reported by Imai [34]. Another important factor is the relationship between oxygen affinity and Hb level, especially in individuals with amino acid substitutions that affect oxygen affinity. According to Bunn and Forget [1], oxygen affinity is directly proportional to the Hb level; hence, high oxygen affinity Hb variants lead to erythrocytosis in most patients, while variants with reduced oxygen affinity usually cause anemia. These factors provide possible explanations for the associated symptoms of borderline anemia in Hb Bassett and episodes of cyanosis in the proband.
