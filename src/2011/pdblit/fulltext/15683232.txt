ABSTRACT: We report the crystal structure of alanine racemase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (AlrMtb) at 1.9 Å resolution. In our structure, AlrMtb is found to be a dimer formed by two crystallographically different monomers, each comprising 384 residues. The domain makeup of each monomer is similar to that of Bacillus and Pseudomonas alanine racemases and includes both an R/ -barrel at the N-terminus and a C-terminus primarily made of -strands. The hinge angle between these two domains is unique for AlrMtb, but the active site geometry is conserved. In AlrMtb, the PLP cofactor is covalently bound to the protein via an internal aldimine bond with Lys42. No guest substrate is noted in its active site, although some residual electron density is observed in the enzyme's active site pocket. Analysis of the active site pocket, in the context of other known alanine racemases, allows us to propose the inclusion of conserved residues found at the entrance to the binding pocket as additional targets in ongoing structure-aided drug design efforts. Also, as observed in other alanine racemase structures, PLP adopts a conformation that significantly distorts the planarity of the extended conjugated system between the PLP ring and the internal aldimine bond.

With approximately one-third of the world's population infected with the tuberculosis bacillus, tuberculosis (TB)1 is the deadliest infectious disease for human adults (1). Every year, about 8 million people will develop active TB and between 2 and 3 million will succumb to this illness (2, 3). Although tuberculosis disproportionately affects the Third World, it is still a major concern in the United States. In the early 1990s, a resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States took place primarily due to infection involving patients with AIDS, and was reflected in 64 000 excess cases of tuberculosis reported in this country through 1993 (4). Estimates of the cost to society of these AIDS-related tuberculosis cases have reached hundreds of millions of dollars (5). As a result, advances in the treatment of tuberculosis would have enormous public health benefits.

Coupled with this increase in the incidence of tuberculosis has been a major increase in multidrug resistance. It is estimated that 5-10% of tuberculosis cases in the United States are caused by organisms that are resistant to one or more first-line anti-tuberculosis agents (6), and up to 15% among AIDS patients (7). Treatment of MDR tuberculosis is difficult and so costly that both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health have listed this agent as a bioterrorism threat (8-11). Despite a clear need for new agents, no new drugs specifically marketed to target tuberculosis have been introduced in the United States in more than three decades. Since the sequencing of the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12), great effort has been devoted to the study of promising targets for the development of new antimycobacterial agents (13, 14). One of these proteins, alanine racemase (Alr) (EC 5.1.1.1), is a pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-containing enzyme essential for the growth of bacteria. It catalyzes the racemization of L-alanine into D-alanine, a key building block in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan layer in bacterial cell walls. Because Alr is essentially absent in eukaryotes but ubiquitous among prokaryotes, it has long been an attractive target for antimicrobial development (15, 16). As a result, a number of alanine racemase inhibitors have been synthesized, and most are structural analogues of D-alanine (17). However, these compounds are not specific for Alr, but also act on other PLP-containing enzymes, including those found in humans (18, 19). The antibiotic D-cycloserine is an efficient inhibitor of alanine racemase. It is still marketed as a drug for tuberculosis, but its clinical

use is severely restricted because of serious side effects, such as central nervous system toxicity (20-22). Structural studies on alanine racemase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus) (23, 24) have established that Alr is a homodimeric enzyme, each monomer consisting of two different domains, an R/ -barrel at the N-terminus and a C-terminal domain with a novel architecture composed primarily of -strands. The core of the R/ barrel constitutes the active site in which the PLP cofactor forms an internal aldimine linkage with a lysine residue. Two nearby arginine residues and one tyrosine have been found to be involved in hydrogen bonding with both the PLP cofactor and all inhibitors or substrate analogues used in structural studies to date. (23-27). Further support for these residues having a role in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism has come from structural studies conducted with substrate analogues (27). Structures of Alr with the covalent inhibitors alanine phosphonate and D-cycloserine have demonstrated that inhibition of Alr often occurs via the formation of a stable covalent linkage with PLP (28, 29), which is similar to other PLP enzymes (30, 31). We recently reported the 1.45 Å crystal structure of alanine racemase (DadX) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important human pathogen (26). While most of the structural characteristics of Alr from Geobacillus are conserved in the DadX structure, we reported a serendipitous finding involving PLP. We presented structural evidence of both internal and external aldimine linkages involving PLP in the active site of the DadX crystal structure. This evidence was interpreted to represent a dynamic interchange between an internal aldimine involving lysine and an external aldimine involving an unanticipated guest substrate.

We report here the crystal structure of alanine racemase from M. tuberculosis (AlrMtb) at 1.9 Å resolution. The levels of amino acid sequence identity between AlrMtb and the two other published alanine racemase structures, DadX from P. aeruginosa (DadXPao) (26) and Alr from G. stearothermophilus (AlrBst) (23), are 32 and 34%, respectively (Figure 1). As expected, the structures of all three enzymes are similar, and a detailed comparison is presented. In addition, we now report that residues found outside of the active site but within the entryway leading to the active site are strongly conserved. We propose that these residues be incorporated into current drug design efforts that could allow for the rational design of larger and potentially more specific inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) containing pMB1909 (alrTB) (32) was grown in LB medium with chloramphenicol (30 µg/mL) and kanamycin (50 µg/mL) at 37 °C. At an OD600 of 0.6-0.9, 0.5 mM IPTG was added. Cells were grown overnight at 30 °C and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.5 mM PLP. Cells were lysed using a Spectronic French press at 16 000 psi, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Less than 5% of AlrMtb was found in the soluble fraction. After (NH4)2SO4 25 and 60% cuts, protein pellets were resuspended and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), loaded on a Pharmacia Biotech Q-Sepharose high-performance anion exchange column, and eluted with a NaCl gradient. Pooled fractions containing the highest specific activity were loaded on a Pharmacia Hi-Prep Phenyl (low sub) hydrophobic interaction chromatography column

and eluted with a 1 to 0 M (NH4)2SO4 gradient. Peak fractions were further purified on a Pharmacia Superdex 200 Prep Grade column. For the selenomethionine-containing protein, E. coli B834 (Novagen) was used as the host strain and cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/mL) and selenomethionine. Crystallization. Native and selenomethionine-containing AlrMtb (20 mg/mL) were crystallized at 4 °C in sitting drops equilibrated versus 25% PEG400, 0.3 M CaCl2, and 0.1 M sodium carbonate-bicarbonate (pH 9.2). Hexagonal, deeply yellow crystals with dimensions of 0.3 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm were obtained in space group P41212 with the following unit cell parameters: a ) b ) 164.78 Å and c ) 57.88 Å. Data Collection and Processing. Multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) data sets were collected at beamline 14ID-B of the BioCARS sector of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). Four different MAD data sets were collected at -180 °C on a single crystal to a resolution of 2.2 Å using a MAR CCD detector. Native data were collected to 1.80 Å resolution on a wild-type crystal at beamline F1 of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source using a Q4 CCD detector. All data were integrated, scaled, reduced, and merged using the HKL package (33). Collection and processing statistics for the MAD and native data sets are listed in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement. Assuming two monomers per asymmetric unit, as suggested by a Matthews coefficient of 2.65 with a solvent content of 53%, 19 of the 20 expected selenium atoms were readily located using SOLVE (34). The data were initially phased to 2.2 Å resolution with an overall mean figure of merit of 65%. The experimental phases as determined by SOLVE and the entire native data set were input into ARP/wARP in the warpNtrace mode for the tracing of the protein (35, 36). A total of 10 iterations, consisting of one cycle of model building and 10 cycles of positional and Biso refinement, yielded 89% of the entire trace of the protein (681 of 768 residues) with a connectivity index of 97% and an R-factor of 21.1%. Missing residues (40 in each monomer) were primarily located in the N- and C-termini, but some of them were also located in the active site. The side chains of those residues that could be built were fitted into the corresponding electron density using the side chains docking script side_dock.sh of ARP/ wARP and the amino acid sequence (37). Next, solvent molecules were removed, and the protein model was submitted to 20 cycles of positional refinement with all B-factors

fixed at 20 Å2, followed by 20 cycles of positional and Biso refinement using SHELXL (38) with standard restraints using data to 1.95 Å. At this intermediate state, the values of R and Rfree (calculated on 3% of the whole data set) were 29.9 and 35.0%, respectively. Careful examination of the electron density maps obtained with coefficients 2Fobs - Fcalc (SigmaA map) and Fobs - Fcalc (Sigma-D map) (38) in O (39) revealed additional interpretable density and allowed for the inclusion of 41 more residues, yielding R and Rfree values of 28.2 and 34.2%, respectively. Placement of the PLP cofactors in both monomers further decreased R and Rfree to 27.7 and 33.7%, respectively. By combining ARP/wARP in the solVent building mode with SHELXL refinements, we located a total of 350 waters, yielding values for R and Rfree of 22.9 and 28.3%, respectively. Extension of the data to 1.90 Å, followed by refinement of the anisotropic scaling parameter and addition of a solvent mask, all in SHELXL, further decreased the R and Rfree parameters to their final values of 20.4 and 25.4%, respectively, for 55 001 reflections between 30 and 1.90 Å for which I > 2(I) (Table 2). Further extension of the data to 1.80 Å was attempted but did not improve the density, the R factor, or any other statistics. Because the shell of data from 1.90 to 1.80 Å had higher Rmerge values than other shells, we were not surprised by this result and chose to restrict the data to 1.90 Å. The final AlrMtb structure contains two crystallographically distinct monomers with a total of 722 residues, 5360 nonhydrogen protein atoms, 350 water molecules, and 30 nonhydrogen PLP atoms. The root-mean-square deviations from ideality for bond lengths and angles are 0.006 Å and 1.9°, respectively. Electron density is missing for residues located at the N- and C-termini of both monomers (residues 1-10 and 382-384) and for residues 174-178 in monomer A and residues 264-278 in monomer B. These residues were not included in the structure. Electron density for the side chain of Arg140 of monomer A was also missing and included as alanine in the final refinement. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Description of the OVerall Structure. The structure of Alr from M. tuberculosis (AlrMtb) is a homodimer formed by a head-to-tail association of two monomers (Figure 2). The monomers are crystallographically distinct but very similar in geometry, as evidenced by a low rms difference of 0.56 Å obtained for their CR atoms after least-squares superposi-

tion. Each AlrMtb monomer consists of two different domains. The N-terminal domain is an eight-stranded R/ -barrel formed by residues 1-246. The C-terminal domain comprises residues 247-384 and contains predominantly -structure. When the structure is viewed from the side, there is an angle of approximately 130° between the N- and C-terminal domains. The secondary structure and overall fold of AlrMtb are very similar to those observed in DadXPao and AlrBst (Figure 3), confirming a strong architectural resemblance between prokaryotic alanine racemases. In Table 3, the rms differences between the N- and C-terminal domains of AlrMtb, DadXPao, and AlrBst, each superimposed separately, are reported. These rms values all range between 1.6 and 1.9 Å and indicate that notable structural differences between the individual domains exist despite their strong topological similarity. As shown in Figure 4, the AlrMtb monomer cannot be superimposed onto that of DadXPao or AlrBst as a whole. Superposition of the R/ -barrel of AlrMtb with those of the two other alanine racemases results in their -domains being significantly displaced from each other. In AlrMtb, this shift relative to AlrBst is due to an 8° rotation around an axis that passes through Glu365. Interestingly, the interdomain angle found in AlrMtb is approximately one-half of the 15° interdomain angle recently reported for DadXPao (Figure 4) (26). For the DadXPao and AlrBst structures, these distinct domain orientations appear to result from hydrogen bonding

Calculated using monomer A. Calculated using the active site composed of the N-terminal domain of monomer B and the C-terminal domain of monomer A. It contains residues 40-46, 64-68, 85-89, 104-108, 129-142, 167-175, 207-214, 225-232, and 361-368 from monomer B and residues 269-272 and 316-321 from monomer A.

observed between the N- and C-terminal tails of opposite monomers (26). Although this may also be true for AlrMtb, the density in this region is not very clear. In our analysis, crystal packing does not have any influence on the hinge angle. N-Terminal Domain (residues 1-246). At the N-terminal domain, structural differences between AlrMtb and DadXPao and AlrBst occur near the N-terminus and in some helices and loops located in the periphery of the R/ -barrel (Figure 5a). However, the core residues that form the active site of all three proteins superimpose very well (Figure 6) with rms differences of 0.85 and 0.72 Å between the CR atoms of AlrMtb and those of DadXPao and AlrBst, respectively. In the N-terminus, the first AlrMtb residue observed, Leu11, matches Pro3 of DadXPao and Asp7 of AlrBst with rms differences of 3.9 and 1.0 Å, respectively. Val16 of AlrMtb and Ile8 of

Crystal Structure of M. tuberculosis Alanine Racemase

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 5, 2005 1475 interact with the other monomer upon dimerization. For example, the loops labeled 1 (between B19 and B20 in AlrMtb) and 2 (immediately before H13 in AlrMtb) in Figure 5b contain a different number of residues in all three alanine racemases and adopt somewhat different orientations in all three structures. Another region of significant structural variability is located at the extreme C-terminus. For example, the last residue observed in AlrMtb, Ala381, has a high rms difference with its equivalent residues, Ala357 of DadXPao (5.3 Å) and His371 of AlrBst (3.0 Å). These termini differ in overall length with AlrMtb containing three more residues (382-384) than DadXPao but 14 fewer residues than AlrBst. As a result, the last -strand (B20) of AlrBst is absent in both AlrMtb and DadXPao. These structural differences likely contribute to the variable interdomain angle that has been noted in alanine racemases, because they are involved in hydrogen bonding between the N- and C-termini of opposite monomers. To illustrate, consider Asn379AlrBst, a residue involved in one of the three intermonomer hydrogen bonds that contributes to the interdomain angle in alanine racemase. This residue or its equivalent is lacking in both AlrMtb and DadXPao. In addition, Phe4 of AlrBst, another residue involved in intermonomer hydrogen bonding, is missing in DadXPao, but has an equivalent in AlrMtb, probably Pro8, although density is weak in this region. As a result, it is possible that, of the three intermonomer hydrogen bonds observed in AlrBst, none are present in DadXPao, but one or two may be present in AlrMtb based on sequence homology. This bonding pattern would then potentially explain the different interdomain rotations found in all three proteins. ActiVe Site. The active site of the protein is located in the center of the R/ -barrel and contains a PLP cofactor covalently linked to Lys42. The primary substrate binding cavity in AlrMtb is 5.5 Å × 5.0 Å × 2.5 Å and lies adjacent to the PLP cofactor. Acetate, propionate, alanine phosphonate, D-cycloserine, and the putative substrate in DadX are all located in this region in the structures of complexes reported to date (23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 40). This cavity is delimited on one side by PLP, the side chain of Met319, and the side chains of Tyr46 and Tyr364. Overall, the geometry of the active site of AlrMtb closely matches that of DadXPao and AlrBst (Figure 6). The rms differences between the CR atoms of the active site residues in AlrMtb and their equivalent in DadXPao and AlrBst are 0.85 and 0.72 Å, respectively (Table 3). The levels of sequence identity between the active site residues of AlrMtb and those of DadXPao and AlrBst are 44 and 50%, respectively, while it is 47% between DadXPao and AlrBst. There is clear contiguous electron density between the protein Lys42 and the C4 atom of PLP, characteristic of an internal aldimine bond between the protein and the cofactor. Consistent with several previous alanine racemase structural reports, there is some weak density at 3 in the region where inhibitors and substrates bind, but it is too weak to allow any interpretation. From this active site cavity, a second cavity on the opposite side of PLP is accessible. This cavity, first reported in DadXPao, has dimensions of 6.0 Å × 4.5 Å × 7.5 Å. In AlrBst, this cavity contains four water molecules, whereas in DadXPao, it contains three solvent atoms. In AlrMtb, the presence of Trp88 in this cavity reduces the free space, and only two water molecules are found. One of these two waters

The different interdomain rotation angles for all three proteins are apparent. At the top of the figure, the distance between structurally equivalent residues is reported.

DadXPao are the first residues with rms differences of less than 1 Å (0.55 Å) for these two enzymes. Most regions of AlrMtb that have high rms differences with DadXPao and AlrBst are directly related to deletions and insertions (Figure 1). For instance, the loop between H1 and B2 is one residue longer in AlrMtb than in DadXPao (His34 inserted) but one residue shorter than in AlrBst (Asp31 deleted). As a result, the AlrMtb trace for this loop is distinct from that of DadXPao and AlrBst. Similarly, the turns between H3 and B3, and between B4 and H5 contain insertions or deletions that result in locally higher rms differences with DadXPao and AlrBst. Interestingly, due to insertions between residues 120 and 130, 160 and 170, and 200 and 210, H6H8 are all approximately one turn longer in AlrMtb. On the other hand, since the region of residues 240-249 contains a deletion compared to DadXPao and AlrBst, H11 is replaced with a hairpin loop in AlrMtb. C-Terminal Domain (residues 247-384). The -structure of the C-terminal domain reported for DadXPao (26) and AlrBst (23) is conserved in AlrMtb (Figure 5b). The few structural differences that are observed appear in regions that do not

(Wat203) interacts with both O3 of PLP and NE1 of Trp88, forming a triangular hydrogen bonding network. These two waters also interact with Asp320 and Gln321 from the opposite monomer, as they do in the DadXPao and AlrBst structures. Notably, the bulky side chain Trp88 does not alter the orientation of the strongly conserved residues found within the active site. All bacterial alanine racemases studied to date display similar substrate specificities. This result is completely consistent with the strong structural conservation we observe within their active sites. However, it has also previously been reported by us that the Vmax of AlrMtb is more than 100-fold lower than for either DadXPao or AlrBst (32, 41). Our analysis of the structure does not provide a ready explanation for this

result. It is known that only the homodimeric form of alanine racemase is active (42). It has recently been proposed that variations in kinetic activity found for different alanine racemases may be correlated with their association constant for dimer formation (43). For example, in some Shigella species, those racemases that display tighter monomermonomer association appeared to be more active (43). No data are available with regard to this hypothesis for AlrMtb. Quality of the Electron Density throughout the ActiVe Site. While most of the electron density is of good quality in both active sites of AlrMtb, including the PLP cofactor and the aldimine linkage (Figure 7), there is poor electron density for some residues. In active site 1 (N-terminus of monomer A and C-terminus of monomer B), six residues (174, 175,

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 5, 2005 1477 and forms a loop on the tip of which Tyr271 is located (Figure 5b). Disorder was also observed for this tyrosine in the structures of alanine racemase complexed with acetate, propionate, and D-cycloserine (23, 24), but it did not seem to affect other nearby residues. In these structures, the disorder was hypothetically related to multiple conformations for the neighboring side chain of Cys311 (29). The side chain of Arg140 was accurately located in earlier alanine racemase structures and found to be involved in strong hydrogen bonds with a nearby carbamylated lysine (24, 26, 40). Unfortunately, in AlrMtb, Arg140 is part of a region that exhibits poor electron density. Consequently, the nearby lysine in AlrMtb, Lys133, cannot be identified as a carbamylated derivative. Orientation of PLP. The PLP cofactor and the covalently linked side chain of Lys42 have average B factors of 22.0 and 22.7 Å2 in active site 1 and 22.8 and 23.8 Å2 in active site 2, respectively. The C4 atom of PLP, which is involved in a covalent bond with Lys42, has a somewhat higher B factor than the other atoms of the cofactor (28.7 Å2 in active site 1 and 31.9 Å2 in active site 2). The PLP is positioned such that its plane makes an angle of 20° with the imine bond (Figure 7b). Although the planarity between the PLP and the imine bond favors delocalization of the excess negative charge into the PLP ring upon formation of the carbanion intermediate during racemization (44-46), no such requirement is present for the internal aldimine form. In fact, this out-of-plane geometry for the imine-PLP system has been observed for the internal aldimine in several other alanine racemase structures (23, 24, 26). The lack of planarity could be an artifact due to the modest resolution of protein crystal structure determinations, but it may also suggest that small deviations from planarity in this bond system are not critical. It has been conclusively demonstrated in studies on electron delocalization in small organic compounds with extended -systems that significant deviations from planarity are well-tolerated (47). Alternatively, the lack of planarity could destabilize the internal aldimine and favor the formation of the external aldimine upon encountering the substrate. Hydrogen Bonds with PLP. Most of the hydrogen bonds with the PLP cofactor characteristic of previous alanine racemase structures are also observed in AlrMtb (Figures 8 and 9). The strong interaction between the N1 atom of PLP and a nearby arginine (Arg228) is conserved in AlrMtb at 3.0 Å. Arg228 itself is part of a four-residue hydrogen bond network comprising Tyr271, His172, Arg228, and His209. The strong internal hydrogen bond between the imine nitrogen of Lys42 and O3 of PLP (2.5 Å) confirms the protonated nature of the Schiff base. The phosphate tail of PLP is held in place by a total of six hydrogen bonds, identical to those observed in previously determined structures. However, as described above, poor electron density for some residues interferes with a complete analysis of the hydrogen bond network. One new hydrogen bond noted in this structure involves the O3 atom of PLP with the NE1 atom of Trp88. This 3.3 Å interaction is not observed in the DadXPao and AlrBst structures where Trp88 is replaced with Leu85 and Leu78, respectively. Note that among the residues involved in hydrogen bonding with and around PLP in all three alanine racemases, only a few are not fully conserved. For AlrMtb, they are Trp88, Leu89, and Asn141 as shown below. These

and 269-272) and the side chain of Arg140 are missing and residues 135-142, 172, and 173 have a high average B factor. In contrast, the second active site is complete, but some of the problematic residues in active site 1 also have a high B factor in active site 2 (N-terminus of monomer B and C-terminus of monomer A). As a result, the placement and interpretation of Tyr271, Arg140, and Lys133 were difficult. The fact that these residues are embedded within the active site renders their disorder surprising, since the electron density for the rest of the active site is of good quality. It could suggest that the orientation and position of this three-residue system are correlated. Tyrosine 271 is the structural equivalent of Tyr265 in AlrBst and has been identified as one of the bases that are important in the catalytic mechanism (23). In AlrMtb, it could be built only in active site 2. Even then, its side chain, only roughly positioned because of poor electron density (Figure 7b), has an average B factor of 50.2 Å2. Tyr271 is actually part of a 15-20-residue region showing weak electron density in both active sites. This region comprises B13 and B14 (Figure 3)

three residues are all part of the second cavity described above. ConserVed Entryway into the ActiVe Site. The substrate binding site itself is compact (5.5 Å × 5.0 Å × 2.5 Å) and located near the PLP molecule. Although it is large enough to allow successful docking of molecules in the molecular weight range of 300, it is difficult for these molecules to reach the compact active site because of a constriction in the entryway corridor formed near the PLP by two residues, Tyr271 and Tyr364 (Figure 10). The entryway corridor is roughly conical with its base oriented toward the outside of the enzyme. This entryway narrows as the PLP is approached. The corridor to the active site in alanine racemase can be thought of as three layers, outer, middle, and inner, with the inner layer terminating at the PLP. The construction of these layers is shown schematically in Table 4. The outer layer in AlrMtb contains three residues, Asp357, Lys178, and Ala241. The middle layer contains Arg316, Ile362, Arg296, and Asp177, while the inner layer contains Tyr271, Tyr364, Tyr290, and Ala176. This inner layer contains the two tyrosines, Tyr271 and Tyr364, that gate the entrance of D-Ala

FIGURE 11: Depiction of the binding cavity for AlrMtb viewed from within the enzyme with obstructing residues removed. This cavity begins at the surface of the enzyme and progresses from left to right, traversing the outer, middle, and inner layers of residues until reaching the PLP. Residues from the outer layer are labeled with red text, those from the middle layer with yellow, and those from the inner layer with white. Residues in the middle and inner layers are strongly conserved. To the right of the PLP cofactor, the secondary pocket can also be seen (see the text).

located in each layer of the corridor are shown in Figure 11. To date, most known inhibitors of alanine racemase bind solely to the substrate binding region proximal to the PLP. Another way to approach the problem of drug design for inhibiting alanine racemase would be to include residues from this corridor in an extended pharmacophore model. Now that several structures of alanine racemase are available for comparison, we have discovered that the inner and middle layers of this corridor are strongly conserved across species. This conservation supports the inclusion of these residues in the drug design process. A comparison of this corridor region, sorted by layer, in the structures of alanine racemase in M. tuberculosis, G. stearothermophilus, and P. aeruginosa is shown in Table 4. In the inner and middle layers, all four residues are identical and they are located similarly around the corridor. Residues in the outer layer near the surface of the enzyme are not conserved. Having noticed this strongly conserved structural motif, we proceeded to create ClustalW alignments to screen all the alanine racemase sequences deposited in GenBank for correlation with our model. With very few exceptions (data not shown), all sequences examined, from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, contain identical residues at the positions in question. Also, the presence of these residues in individual alanine racemases is independent of their overall relatedness. For instance, the 69% overall identical Mycobacterium smegmatis sequence shares the identical inner and middle layer residues with the M. tuberculosis sequence, as does the Bordetella pertussis alanine racemase, which is overall only 31% identical to AlrMtb. This result further emphasizes the importance of including the corridor region in the drug design process, thus, resulting in greater flexibility in inhibitor design. A sample docking of a small molecule inhibitor candidate within the alanine racemase corridor is shown in Figure 12 and

FIGURE 12: Depiction of an inhibitor candidate, 2-[(7-chloro-4quinazolinyl)oxy]-1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-1,5-benzodioxepin-7-yl)-1ethanone, chosen to utilize the entrance as well as the active site of the enzyme. In principle, this approach will allow for larger and more specific inhibitors of alanine racemase to be identified. The compound was docked using AutoDock (49). The docking procedure involved using the Lamarckian genetic search algorithm using a population size of 50 with a total of 100 separate docking runs. The docking orientation for the ligand-macromolecule complex presented here was one from the most populated cluster containing 35 members (using a root-mean-square tolerance of 1.5 Å for clustering the docked ligand poses) with a docking energy of -11.01 kcal/mol.

illustrates that inhibitor molecules larger than alanine are easily accommodated within this framework. Other groups have proposed similar strategies for developing inhibitors for enzymes with long entryways into their active sites (48). For example, a histone deacetylase-like

1480 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 5, 2005 protein has been the target of structure-aided drug design efforts because of its role in the transcriptional process. It is unrelated to alanine racemase except that it also contains a long passageway from the exterior of the enzyme into the active site. Recently, the development of inhibitors that target multiple sites within this enzyme, including the outer pocket, inner corridor, and internal active site, has been proposed (48). It is felt that these inhibitors may have significant advantages over those that target only a single site within the enzyme. CONCLUSION Analysis of the AlrMtb structure confirms once more that this enzyme remains a challenging but important target for drug design against tuberculosis. We now have a structure of the actual macromolecule that is the clinical target of D-cycloserine, an important antibiotic for use against drug resistant TB. The structure is very similar to the alanine racemase structures known from Geobacillus and Pseudomonas. The hinge angles between the monomer domains of all three structures are unique, but key active site residues superimpose well. The most significant result to come from this structural report involves the entryway that leads to the active site. Our analysis reveals that the inner and middle regions of this corridor are strongly conserved across species, while regions near the enzyme surface are more variable. Drug design trials that target features within the entryway as well as the active site pocket are now underway in our laboratories.
