Amphipol A8-35: A Polymeric Surfactant for Membrane Protein S Studies
Amphipols are a new class of surfactants that serve as stabilizers of membrane proteins in aqueous solutions. Amphipols can substitute traditional detergents used to extract membrane proteins, keeping them soluble in detergent ble detergent-free aqueous solutions while stabilizing them biochemically(1-3). Amphipol A8-35 is the most thoroughly characterized amphipol and is 35 becoming widely used for membrane protein re research. It consists of a strong hydrophilic polyacrylate chain onto which octylamine and isopropyl isopropylamine have been randomly grafted(1, 4, 5) ne (Figure 1 A). Amphipol A8-35 is highly water soluble (> 200 g/L depending on pH and ionic 35 i strength of the solutions)(4, 5). The high solubility is due to the anionic charges (~25 per anionic molecule) carried by the carboxylate groups(4). The average molecular mass of individual A8-35 rried individ molecules is 9-10 kDa(1, 4, 5). In aqueous solutions (pH > 7.0), Amphipol A8-35 self-assembles 35 self into globular particles, each comprising ~4 molecules, with an average mass of ~40 kDa and a Stokes radius of ~3.15 nm (Figure 1B)(5). The critical aggregation concentration is so low as to be negligible under most circumstances(3). igible

Due to its amphipathic character, Amphipol A8 A8-35 is able to "trap" solubilized membrane " proteins by adsorbing onto their hydrophobic transmembrane surface, stabilizing their native structure and preserving their functionality(2, 3) (Figure 2). Applications Although its detergency is too weak to effectively extract and solubilize most membrane cy solubilize proteins [for some exceptions, see ref. 2], Amphipol A8-35 has been very successfully used to for 35 replace the detergent after the solubilization step and handle the extracted proteins in their native state in detergent-free solutions [for an example of trapping procedure, see ref. (8) free [for (Figure 3)]. To date, amphipols have been used to trap ~30 different types of membrane .

Functional studies

Reducing inactivation by the detergent and preserving membrane protein native structure and function. Avoiding perturbations of the latter by detergents. In the vast majority of cases, trapping by Amphipol A8-35 has no effect on ligand/substrate binding.

Folding/Refolding

Amphipol A8-35 is a mild surfactant which provides a favorable environment for proteins to fold or refold from denatured state.

NMR

Maintaining the solubilized membrane protein soluble without detergent, thus stabilizing the native structure. Note, however, that membrane protein/Amphipol A8-35 complexes cannot be handled at acidic pH. Addition of EDTA improves the spectra. Stabilizing native structure. Mitochondrial Complex I/Amphipol A8-35 particles were observed to spread better than Complex I/detergent ones in cryo-EM singleparticle experiments.

Immobilization of membrane proteins onto solid supports

Appropriate functionalization of Amphipol A8-35 turns it into a sort of double-faced tape that can be used to anchor amphipol-trapped membrane proteins onto solid surfaces such as chips or beads for ligand binding studies.

proteins, ranging in molecular weight from 5 kDa to > 1MDa(2, 3). Small proteins may bind ~50 kDa of Amphipols(10), the mass of Amphipol bound increasing slowly with the size of the transmembrane region(2). The protein/Amphipol complexes thus formed are slightly larger than those formed with classical detergents
(6, 8, 10, 13)

. Although there can be exceptions(3, 6, 14)) in

most cases, trapping by Amphipol A8-35 affects neither the binding of ligands or substrates nor the functionality of membrane proteins(3, 7, 10, 12, 15). A list of applications is given in Table 1.
