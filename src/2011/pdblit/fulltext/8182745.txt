Abstract Colipase is a small protein cofactor needed by pancreatic lipase for the efficient dietary lipid hydrolysis. It binds to the Cterminal, non-catalytic domain of lipase, thereby stabilising an active conformation and considerably increasing the overall hydrophobic binding site. Structural studies of the complex and of colipase alone have clearly revealed the functionality of its architecture. Interestingly, a structural analogy has recently been discovered between colipase and a domain in a developmental protein (Dickkopf), based on sequence analogy and homology modeling. Whether this structural analogy implies a common function (lipid interaction) remains to be clarified. Structural analogies have also been recognised between the pancreatic lipase C-terminal domain, the N-terminal domains of lipoxygenases and the C-terminal domain of K-toxin. These non-catalytic domains in the latter enzymes are important for interaction with membranes. It has not been established if these domains are also involved in eventual protein cofactor binding as is the case for pancreatic lipase. ß 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The three main factors which are involved in the duodenal digestion of dietary triglycerides in mammals include two proteins, pancreatic lipase and colipase, and bile salts. In the literature, colipase is usually described as a protein counteracting in vitro the inhibiting action of bile salts on the activity of lipase. However, in vivo, dietary fats are associated with a very complex intracellular and extracellular matrix, containing mixed polysaccharides (¢bres, cellulose), (glyco)proteins (water soluble as well as water insoluble) and other smaller molecules. These polymeric and amphiphilic structures reduce the accessibility to the dietary fat and therefore constitute a barrier © for an e¤cient hydrolysis to occur (Carriere, unpublished). Apart from their important role during intestinal absorption, bile salts are needed to `clean' the lipid surface and to prepare them for the action of digestive lipases. The dietary lipids in the presence of bile salts, however, cannot be hydrolysed by pancreatic lipase alone. This process needs therefore a small protein cofactor, colipase. This very e¤cient trio (lipase/colipase/bile salt) digests dietary lipids in an environment where other lipases would probably fail. In addition to extensive studies using biochemical techniques, our understanding of lipolysis by pancreatic lipase has increased considerably thanks to a number of 3-D structure determinations. The ¢rst crystal structure of human pancreatic lipase (HPL) revealed the presence of two clearly distinct structural domains [1]. Later crystal structures of pancreatic lipase complexed with colipase established the correspondence between structural and functional domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1^335) which has an K/L-hydrolase fold carries the active site, while the C-terminal domain (residues 336^ 449) forms a L-barrel structure and provides the main colipase binding site [2,3]. Upon opening of the active site, achieved by a drastic conformational change of a surface loop sitting above the catalytic triad in the inactive (closed) form, a second colipase binding site is created. In the active (open) complex,

colipase is held in a grip between the N-terminal and C-terminal lipase domains. An overall scheme of interfacial binding to lipids and the activation of pancreatic lipase is represented in Fig. 1. Pancreatic lipases can be divided in three subgroups sharing about 70% sequence identities. The three subgroups have distinct catalytic properties and therefore o¡er the possibility of testing the relation between structure and function by the use of chimera proteins. The physiological role is not known yet for some of these subgroups. We have recently reviewed the structure and catalytic properties of the pancreatic lipase subfamilies [4]. We will therefore focus here on the structure and the role of colipase and its interaction with the non-catalytic Cterminal domain of pancreatic lipase. 2. Structure and functional analysis of the lipase colipase complex The structure of hybrid complexes between human pancreatic lipase and porcine colipase were obtained under various experimental conditions [2,3]. The crystallisation bu¡er of the ¢rst complex solved contained, besides the crystallising agent, also a nonionic detergent L-octyl glucoside at submicellar concentrations. The structure showed that pancreatic lipase was present in the closed form, identical to the structure of pancreatic lipase alone [1]. In this structure, the active site is covered by a long surface loop (23 amino acid residues), contained between a disulphide bridge. Colipase was bound exclusively to the C-terminal domain of lipase, with the plane of colipase roughly perpendicular to the centre of the Cterminal lipase L-sheet [2]. The total buried surface is î î î 1212 A2 (630 A2 for colipase and 582 A2 for lipase), a value which is at the lower side of values of typical protein^protein complexes [5]. The interaction between colipase and the C-terminal lipase domain is through residues of two colipase hairpin loops, connecting ¢ngers 2 and 3 (44^47) and ¢ngers 3 and 4 (64^67). The binding interface is characterised mainly

The open form (E*), induced by contact with the lipid^water interface is generated by conformational changes in the lid and the L5 loop, unmasking the hydrophobic L9 loop.

by polar interactions. The interaction between lipase and colipase in solution is rather weak, but increases in the presence of a lipid interface [6,7]. The structure of the lipase^colipase complex was also obtained in the presence of mixed phospholipid^ bile salt micelles [3] or after covalent lipase inhibition by C11 alkyl phosphonate [8]. Under these conditions, the lid has undergone a drastic conformational change, yielding access to the active site. In these structures, the active site is either occupied by a (lyso)-phospholipid molecule or the covalently bound inhibitor. This conformational change brings the lid into contact with the N-terminal part of colipase, creating a second (but smaller) lipase colipase binding site. This interaction with the open lid suggested a second role for colipase: stabilisation of an active (open) lipase conformation. Mutations of residue

Glu-15 from colipase that contacts the lid have decreased activity. The E15R colipase mutant has 175fold less activity compared to wild-type colipase, but it is as e¡ective as the wild-type in anchoring lipase to mixed emulsions [9]. These experiments provide strong evidence for the catalytic importance of this second interaction site. A pancreatic lipase mutant with a deletion of the lid region is reactivated by colipase in the presence of bile salts. The reactivation by colipase is associated with strong interfacial binding of the mutant and the lid is therefore not essential for either interfacial binding of HPL or for lipase^colipase interactions [10]. These results leave the possibility open of an interaction between the lid and colipase that stabilises an active conformation. Nevertheless, the HPL mutant with the lid deleted possesses a low speci¢c activity.

The structure of the porcine lipase^colipase complex was determined in the presence of another neutral detergent, tetra-ethylene glycol monooctyl ether (TGME), and is very similar to the human lipase^ porcine colipase structure. [11]. The greatest overall di¡erence between the two structures resided in a di¡erent relative orientation of the lipase's N- and C-terminal domains. Colipase, the lipase C-terminal domain and the lid can be perfectly superimposed in the two complexes. On the other hand, this superimposition induces a clear shift in the overlay of the respective catalytic domains, indicating a bending between the two lipase domains. This £exibility was also observed when comparing the structure of various uncomplexed lipases [1,12]. Porcine lipase and colipase interact through 8 polar, 17 van der Waals, and 4 water-mediated contacts. As judged from sequence analysis, these are probably involved in contacts of lipase and colipase from various species. One interesting di¡erence concerns the salt bridge between Arg-44 of colipase and the lipase Asp-390 in the human^porcine complex. In the porcine natural complex, this salt bridge is not present since Asp-390 is interacting intra-molecularly with Arg-368 from lipase [11]. This interaction is similar to the one observed between Asp-390 and Lys-368 in the uncomplexed human lipase. Arg-44 is not conserved (Ser in human colipase) and the observed salt bridge can therefore not be formed in the human natural complex. The importance of a hypothetical polar interaction between the strictly conserved Lys-400 of lipase and Glu-45 of colipase has been veri¢ed experimentally by site-directed mutagenesis [13]. Modi¢cation of one or both of these residues resulted in a reduced a¤nity and a loss of activity against emulsi¢ed substrates in the presence of bile salts. Attempts to reverse the salt bridge by combining the K400E lipase mutation with an E45K in colipase was even more detrimental for the catalytic activity. An interesting study used low resolution neutron di¡raction studies to de¢ne the organisation of detergent micelles in the crystal [14]. The authors observed a large distorted disk-shaped density that contacts the concave face of colipase and the lower tip of the lipase C-terminal domain. Colipase interacts with the micelle through the 70^85 loop, but other regions are involved as well, such as Phe-52 and Tyr-55. The

latter residue is part of the hydrophobic plane formed by the extremities of the colipase ¢ngers and predicted to contribute to the lipid binding site [2,3]. The 70^85 loop from colipase has a di¡erent orientation in the crystal [2,11] and solution structures [15] which could be due to the interactions of the hydrophobic side chains of this loop with the micelle (the solution structure was obtained in the absence of detergents). The orientation of this loop, however, shows great variability in the NMR structures, explained by few interactions with the rest of the colipase molecule. The interaction of pancreatic lipase with the micelle involves the following amphipathic regions: 367^373, 384^387, 401^404 and 408^ 412. There is no direct interaction between the micelle and the active site region. From this observation, the authors concluded that the pancreatic lipase^colipase complex is activated by mixed micelle binding to a region far removed from the active site and that this activation occurs in the aqueous phase [14]. There exist some reasons to question the mechanistic conclusions of these results: the lipase^colipase is fully active on pure triglyceride droplets as well as on pure mono-molecular lipid ¢lms and there is thus no need for the presence of micelles for the pancreatic lipase to express its catalytic activity. The fact that the authors did not observe a micelle interacting with the active site could simply mean that the crystal packing forces are preventing interactions of this region of the protein with the micelle. In all the known structures of the open lipase colipase complexes, the hydrophobic regions of the active site tend to pack face to face. We even observed bound detergent (L-octyl glucoside) molecules between the exposed hydrophobic surfaces of the open lipase molecules in the crystal [16]. Although submicellar concentrations of L-octyl glucoside are absolutely required for the crystallisation of the human lipase^ porcine colipase complex, it was the closed form that was observed in the crystal structure [2]. Direct binding of detergent to colipase was also observed in the crystal structure of the C11 inhibited colipase^ lipase complex [17]. One L-octyl glucoside contacts both lipase and colipase. The neutron di¡raction study does show the complexity of lipase^colipase^ lipid interactions and the possibility of regions remote from to active site to be involved in lipid inter-

actions. Little is known at the molecular level about the orientation and the conformation of lipases at a lipid/water interface. 3. Interaction of natural variants of pancreatic lipase with colipase Among the subgroups of the pancreatic lipase family a number of interesting variants constitute a natural handle for structure/function studies of pancreatic lipases. For instance the guinea pig pancreatic lipase (GPLRP2) has a large deletion in the lid, but otherwise has a very homologous amino acid sequence to the classical pancreatic lipase [18]. This enzyme, which is active on insoluble substrates such as trioctanoin, is inhibited by bile salts, but cannot be reactivated by colipase [19]. The truncated lid of only ¢ve residues has no possibility to ful¢l the same functions as the classical lipase lids (23 residues). The C-terminal domain of GPLRP2 has mutations at nine amino acid positions out of the 12 that interact with colipase. The lack of colipase e¡ect on GPLRP2 can, therefore, result from combined e¡ects of mutations in the C-terminal domain and from the impossibility to interact with the mini-lid. Furthermore, GPLRP2 presents a high PLA1 phospholipase activity, totally undetectable in the classical pancreatic lipase family. An exchange between the C-terminal domain of GPLRP2 with that of HPL results in a chimeric mutant which is partly reactivated by colipase in the presence of bile salts. The structure of the chimera was determined at 2.1 î A. The C-terminal is identical to that of HPL [20]. These results together with those obtained with the HPL lid deletion mutant (see above) tend to prove that the impaired colipase activation of GPLRP2 is solely due to de¢cient colipase binding to the C-terminal domain. A similar enzyme belonging to the PLRP2 subfamily is secreted by the pancreas of the coypu (CoPLRP2). Despite the presence of a full-length lid in this variant, colipase does not reactivate the bile salt inhibited enzyme, although a weak e¡ect is observed at low bile salt concentrations. Most of the residues of the lid and the C-terminal domain, involved in colipase binding in HPL, are conserved in CoPLRP2. One exception is the substitution of

Tyr-403 for His (Asn or Lys in the other RP2 family members). In HPL Tyr-403 stacks onto Arg-65 of colipase and probably contributes to the binding energy. The site-directed Y403N mutant of HPL has a reduced capacity for reactivating its lipase activity but still interacts with colipase as revealed by dotblot analysis [9]. Examination of the structure of the lipase^colipase complex showed that some important residues that mediate interactions between the open lid and the core of the catalytic domain are mutated in CoPLRP2. Therefore the conformation of the open lid in CoPLRP2 could be di¡erent from the one observed in the HPL^colipase complex. Despite the fact that the residues of the lid which interact with colipase are conserved, the altered conformation of the CoPLRP2 lid could a¡ect colipase binding. Similar mutations are also observed in the rat PLRP2, but the kinetic data suggest that rat PLRP2 still could interact with colipase. The structure of the rat PLRP2 has recently been determined in its closed form [21]. The full-length lid of this PLRP2 adopts in the crystal the same closed conformation as observed in the 3-D structure of HPL alone [1]. The three residues from the lid domain and eight out of 12 residues in the C-terminal domain, involved in colipase interaction, are conserved in rat PLRP2. Modelling of a putative colipase^rat PLRP2 complex has shown that subtle side chain adjustments would relax unfavourable interactions resulting from the above-described substitutions. The activity and the possible physiological role of the PLRP1 subfamily remain enigmatic. They do not display in vitro any signi¢cant activity against triglycerides or phospholipids [22^25]. The dog PLRP1 protein (DPLRP1) was recently puri¢ed and its 3-D structure determined [26] showing a high degree of structural similarity to the closed form of HPL. Inspection of the active site region indicated two amino substitutions, Ala-178-Val and Ala-180-Pro, in the DPLRP1 compared to HPL. Modelling of a phosphonate inhibitor into the DPLRP1 active site resulted in a steric clash of Val-178 with one of the two alkyl chains and this residue may therefore be responsible for the absence of activity of this variant. All the catalytically active variants of pancreatic lipase have an Ala at position 178 and a Pro at position 180. Residue Pro-180 is always substituted by an Ala in PLRP1. The DPLRP1 double mutant Val-

178-Ala/Ala-180-Pro showed considerable activity against tributyrin and trioctanoin. Its activity was inhibited at high bile salts concentrations and restored by the presence of colipase [9,26]. The clear colipase stimulation of the catalytic activity of the human PLRP1 double mutant, in the presence of bile salt, can be attributed to a speci¢c interaction between colipase and human PLRP1, as in the case of classical pancreatic lipase [2]. 4. The C-terminal domain of pancreatic lipase and its structural analogies with other proteins The presence of a C-terminal non-catalytic domain of about 100 residues really distinguishes pancreatic lipase from all other triglyceride lipases whose structures have been determined. This domain is also present in other lipases of the pancreatic lipase family, such as hepatic lipase (HL) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), but is absent in other mammalian lipases, such as gastric lipase (Roussel, unpublished) or bile salt stimulated lipase [27]. Although the sequence homology within the C-terminal domain of various members of the pancreatic lipase family is very low, these C-terminal domains certainly possess a similar three-dimensional fold [28]. Recent structure^function relationships have suggested that this C-terminal domain may have an extra role apart from binding colipase. This domain contains an exposed loop (L5P loop according to the Winkler numbering) inserted between two strands, at the opposite side of the catalytic domain. This loop has a rather hydrophobic character and is not masked by colipase binding. This loop is oriented towards the lipid^water interface (if we take the lidcolipase hydrophobic plateau to position this interface) and therefore may play a role in lipid binding. This L5P loop interacts also with a detergent micelle in the porcine lipase^colipase complex, as evidenced by neutron di¡raction [14]. The hydrophobic nature of this L5P loop is even more pronounced for the other members of the pancreatic lipase family, such as LPL and HL. For instance, LPL has three extra tryptophan residues present in its L5P loop. Mutagenesis of these tryptophans in LPL abolishes binding to lipoproteins [29,30] and a proteolytic cleavage within this L5P

loop decreases the activity against long chain triglyceride emulsions and chylomicrons without a¡ecting esterase activity [31]. Another indirect line of evidence for the involvement of the L5P loop from the pancreatic C-terminal domain comes from studies with monoclonal antibodies raised against the region between Met-397 and Arg-414. The catalytic activity of pancreatic lipase against water insoluble substrates diminished drastically in the presence of these antibodies, whereas its esterase activity on tripropionin monomers persisted [10]. Over the last years, a number of protein structures have been determined that contain modules with close structural homology to the L-sandwich C-terminal domain of pancreatic lipase. Lipoxygenases catalyse the formation of leukotrienes and lipoxins from polyunsaturated fatty acids. The mammalian 15-lipoxygenase is able to oxidise low density lipoprotein particles and may therefore play a role in atherosclerosis [32,33]. The crystal structure of this enzyme revealed the presence of two domains: an Nterminal L-barrel domain and a C-terminal predominantly K-helical domain [34]. The structure of the catalytic C-terminal domain is very similar to the one from the soybean lipoxygenase [35]. Although a N-terminal domain is also present in the soybean enzyme, its presence in the mammalian enzyme escaped sequence scrutiny because it is much shorter than in the soybean enzyme. The structure of the mammalian lipoxygenase is much more compact than the one from plant. The 3-D structure of the N-terminal L-barrel domain in the mammalian lipoxygenases is virtually the same as the C-terminal Lsandwich domain in pancreatic lipase (Fig. 2A). At the amino acid sequence level, the 15-LOX N-terminal domain has 23% identity with the corresponding C-terminal domain from LPL (whose structure, however, is still unknown) as well as from the other members of the pancreatic lipase family (including hepatic lipase (HL)). Modelling studies using the pancreatic lipase structure as a template suggested that lipoprotein lipase also has a L-barrel C-terminal domain [28]. Although well structured by itself, the L-barrel domain of lipoxygenase could make rigid body motions with respect to the catalytic domain [34]. This mobility is reminiscent of the £exibility of the C-terminal domains of pancreatic lipases as deduced from a number of 3-D structures [1,2,12]. The

Comparison of the N-terminal domain of lipoxygenase (residues 2^110, PDB code 1LOX) and the C-terminal domain of human pancreatic lipase (residues 337^449, PDB code 1LPA). (B) Superposition of Ktoxin (green) and pancreatic lipase (blue) L-barrel domains. Comparison of the C-terminal domain of K-toxin (residues 255^ 369, co-ordinates kindly provided by Dr. Basak) and the C-terminal domain of human pancreatic lipase (residues 337^449, PDB code 1LPA). Bound Cd ions in the toxin structure are represented as green spheres and the two neighbouring Cd ions are believed to be the possible Ca ion binding sites that interact with phospholipids [38].

structural similarity of the L-barrel domains between lipases and lipoxygenases probably relates to common functional requirements: both classes of enzymes are water soluble and act on lipid molecules included in self-organised superstructures, such as membranes, micelles, emulsions, etc. It was proposed that lipoxygenase could anchor the lipid substrate by virtue of a hydrophobic loop at the tip of the Lbarrel domain. This small loop contains the well-exposed Phe-70 and Ile-71 residues whose hydrophobic nature is well conserved in all lipoxygenases [34]. It was also suggested that the L-barrel domain in lipoxygenase could mediate binding of the 5-lipoxyge-

nase activating protein FLAP [36], although this activator is not structurally related to colipase. The key virulence factor of Clostridium perfrigens in gas gangrene is the K-toxin, shown to be a phospholipase C. This enzyme is a zinc and calcium metallo-phospholipase which is also present in non-toxic bacterial strains. It is believed that the major di¡erence between toxic and non-toxic bacterial phospholipases C is due to the haemolytic activity of the former. At the amino acid sequence level, haemolytic bacterial phospholipases C are characterised by an additional C-terminal 120 amino acids residues which can confer toxicity [37]. The crystal structure of the Clostridium perfrigens K-toxin revealed two well-de¢ned domains: an K-helical N-terminal catalytic, zinc-dependent, domain (residues 1^246) with strong similarity to the non-toxic Bacillus cereus phospholipase C and a L-sandwich C-terminal domain (residues 247^370) responsible for membrane binding in a calcium-dependent manner. These two domains are connected by a £exible linker [38]. This C-terminal domain has no sequence homology with any other proteins of known function but, as seen from Fig. 2B, it turned out to be structurally very similar to the C-terminal domain of pancreatic liî pases (rms deviation of 1.9 A for 86 CK atoms superposed) and hence the N-terminal domain of soybean î lipoxygenase (rms deviation of 2.1 A for 76 CK atoms superposed) [35]. The C-terminal domain of K-toxin also resembles the structures of eucaryotic C2 domains. The C2 domains occur in a wide range of signalling proteins (in one or multiple copies) and calcium-dependent proteins interacting with membranes (reviewed in [39]). The resemblance with C2 domains is as follows: those of synaptotagmin I [40] (60 CK atoms with î an rms deviation of 2.4 A) and of phosphoinositide-speci¢c phospholipase CN1 (60 CK positions î with rms deviation of 2.2 A) [41]. The N-terminal domains of lipoxygenases as well as the C-terminal domains from pancreatic lipases and from Clostridium perfrigens K-toxin have identical topologies while they are di¡erent for the remaining C2 domains. The Clostridium perfrigens K-toxin is the ¢rst example of the existence of a C2-like domain in procaryotes. The crystal structure of the C. perfrigens K-toxin could not be obtained in the presence of calcium ions, but crystals grew in the presence of 50 mM

cadmium. These ions were found both in the active site and in the C-terminal domain where one cadmium ion is octahedrally ligated by Asp-336 (ON1), Asp-269 (O); Gly-271 (O); Ala-337 (O) and two water molecules. Two of these ligands (Asp-336 and Asp-269) were shown to be important for calcium activation of K-toxin [42,43]. The 3-D structure of the C-terminal domain of C. perfrigens K-toxin presents two well-exposed hydrophobic surface residues: Trp-214 and Phe-334, probably involved in membrane interactions. The necessary calcium ions required for membrane binding [43] would interact electrostatically with the polar phospholipid head groups. Lipoxygenases and pancreatic lipases have large insertions in the calcium binding loop when amino acid sequences are compared to the C. perfrigens K-toxin, although they do not have the aspartates to ligand the calcium ion. The 3-D structure of the C. perfrigens K-toxin allowed the authors to propose a model for its interaction with phospholipid membranes, in which both the region around the active site and the calcium binding site, from the C-terminal domain, are involved in anchoring the enzyme at the lipid^water interface. Two variants, with and without C-terminal domains as in the case of the phospholipase C family, occur also in the pancreatic lipase family. The phospholipases A1 from the hornet and vespid venoms contain a single catalytic domain with considerable sequence homology, and therefore structural resemblance, with the pancreatic lipase N-terminal catalytic domain [44,45]. Unfortunately, their catalytic activity is not yet well characterised. 5. Structure and function of colipase The 3-D structure of colipase has been determined in a complex with pancreatic lipase by X-ray crystallography and alone in solution by NMR. Colipase belongs to a family of small cysteine-rich proteins which lack extensive secondary structure. It is a fairly î £at molecule of dimensions 25U30U35 A. Colipase can be described as an assembly of protruding ¢ngers, held together at one end by an intricate network of ¢ve disulphide bridges. Its structure consists of two small domains with very similar topology [15]. The motif in each domain is made of a small central

anti-parallel L-sheet, stabilised by two disulphide bridges (Fig. 3A,B). The connections between the strands are made by loops that are much longer than the strands themselves. Intra-strand main chain hydrogen bonds are only observed between residues that are close to the cysteines. As shown in Fig. 3B, the connections between the strands and the spatial disulphide patterns are identical between the two domains. The disulphide patterns within each domain are organised as follows: one disulphide bond (C17^ C28 in domain one and C49^C69 in domain two) links the ¢rst to the second strand and the second one (C23^C39 in domain one and C63^C87 in domain two) connects the third strand to the linker peptide between strands one and two. The two domains are connected to each other by the central disulphide bridge: C27^C61. The peptide connecting the two domains (residues 40^47) carries one of the turns involved in lipase binding. The second lipase binding peptide is between the ¢rst and the second strand of the second domain. Therefore, the two colipase domains do not interact in a `symmetric' fashion with lipase. The topology of these domains is the same as for the cellulose binding domain (CBD) of the exo-cellobiohydrolase from Trichoderma reesei, which is involved in the attachment of the enzyme to the insoluble cellulose substrate and therefore has some functional analogy with colipase [46]. The structure of this 34 amino acid cellulose binding domain was determined in solution by NMR [47]. It consists of three anti-parallel strands that are strapped together by two disulphide bridges in an identical manner as in the case of colipase. Fig. 3A shows the superposition of the disul¢de bridges of the CBD and of the second colipase domain, clearly demonstrating their common structured core. NMR structure determination in solution of colipase alone has yielded similar observations on protein mobility as in the crystal structure: it con¢rmed the disorder in the tips of the three ¢ngers and in the terminal regions [15]. Analysis of the NMR spectra suggested motional averaging on a slower time scale due to conformational £exibility of the extremities of the ¢ngers. The 3-D structure as well as the dynamics of colipase support its function: the most compact and hydrophilic side mediates the speci¢c protein^ protein contacts, while the mobile tips of the ¢ngers carry the majority of the hydrophobic residues and

Fig. 3. (A) CK superposition of the cellulose binding domain of cellobiohydrolase I (red) [47] and the second domain of porcine colipase (residues 42^90) [2]. The structurally well-conserved cysteine motif was used for the superposition. (B) Superposition of the cysteine motifs of the two colipase domains. The ¢rst domain (in red) comprises cysteine bridges C23^C39/C17^C28 and the second domain (in blue) C63^C87/C49^C69 C. Superposition of the CK structures of colipase (blue) and MIT1 (red). The cysteine bridge network is equally represented for both structures. Both structures were aligned in order to obtain an optimal ¢t of the disul¢de bridges.

are probably involved in less speci¢c hydrophobic interactions with mixed lipid/bile salt interfaces. The importance of some of the most prominent hydrophobic residues in the putative middle ¢nger of colipase (residues 47^63) was tested by site directed mutagenesis [48]. This ¢nger contains the three absolutely conserved tyrosines suspected to interact with lipids already before the 3-D structure was reported [49]. For instance, Tyr-55 and Tyr-59 in£uenced the catalytic activity of the lipase^colipase complex: their mutation into aspartate decreased the activity towards long chain substrates, without

changing their ability to anchor lipase to the lipid^ water interface [48]. From the above study, it was also concluded that Tyr-58 plays a more structural role and is probably not directly involved in lipid binding, in line with a more hidden position in the colipase core as compared to the two other surface exposed tyrosines. 6. Colipase: unexplained alliances As mentioned above, colipase belongs to a family

of proteins stabilised by a high content of disul¢de bridges and lacking extensive secondary structure. A large number of proteins have those characteristics and for a number of them their 3-D structures have been determined. Some of these proteins, such as the snake venom toxins, have a similar overall architecture as colipase and a di¡erent topology: a compact core held together by disul¢de bridges and protruding connected loops. The NMR solution structure of MIT1 (mamba intestinal toxin 1), a protein isolated from Dendroaspis polylepis polylepis venom, revealed that this protein has an unexpectedly high structural î homology with colipase (rms deviation of 1.3 A for more than 60 residues). MIT1 contains ¢ve disul¢de bridges for 80 residues in total and is not related to any class of snake venom proteins so far isolated [50]. This structural homology was not predicted from sequence analysis alone. Colipase and MIT1 have identical disul¢de patterns and similar secondary structure motifs. The ¢ve disulphide bridges are perfectly superimposable as well as the regions that form the well structured core of both proteins. As can be seen from Fig. 3C most of the L-turns which form the most structured regions of this protein are structurally conserved. The residues that are interacting with lipase, however, are not conserved in MIT1. Insertions and deletions are located in the ¢ngers which form the probable lipid interacting surface of colipase. Fingers I and II are longer by one residue in MIT1 and ¢nger III possesses six extra residues as compared to the third colipase ¢nger. The last ¢nger of MIT1 is shortened by eight residues. These di¡erences result in rather di¡erent orientations for the last two ¢ngers. The hydrophobic nature of the extremities of the ¢ngers is also present in MIT1 and suggest a possible interaction with biomembranes [50]. Despite strong structural homology, MIT1 has no activity on pancreatic lipase and colipase failed to contract ileum smooth muscle. Protein

CM2 which is related to another snake toxin family, disintegrin, displays 29% sequence identity with colipase and may therefore also evolutionary be related to colipase. The presence of a domain with a colipase fold was recently suggested for the C-terminal domain of the Wnt antagonist, Dickkopf (Dkk) [51]. The protein is released from the Spemann organiser and is involved in Xenopus head formation [52]. The signalling pathway starts extra-cellularly by the binding of Wnt to the frizzled-like receptors. The resulting signalling cascade is necessary in vertebrate development to initiate posterior structures and is antagonised by molecules such as Dkk. The Dkk sequence consists of two cysteine-rich domains. The C-terminal domain has the typical cysteine pattern of colipase. Detailed sequence analysis and molecular modelling of the Dkk sequence onto the colipase structure convincingly suggests that Dkk and colipase have the same disul¢de pattern and very similar three-dimensional structures (van Tilbeurgh, unpublished). The length and nature of the short connections between the cysteines that form the lipase binding site in colipase, are well conserved in Dkk. Insertions and deletions are found in the extremities of the ¢ngers. Some hydrophobic residues are present in the Dkk ¢nger tips which could suggest a possible interaction with membrane lipids, as in the case of MIT1. The amino acid sequence of the Dkk C-terminal domain could equally be well ¢tted onto the MIT1 structure (Fig. 4) (van Tilbeurgh, unpublished). The length of the second ¢nger of the Dkk seems more analogous to the corresponding ¢nger structure from MIT1 while the third ¢nger of the Dkk ¢ts better the colipase structure. Therefore the 3-D structure of Dkk is probably very close to those of colipase and MIT1 in the regions close to the disul¢de bridges and could be viewed as an hybrid form between colipase and MIT1 as far as the ¢nger regions are concerned.

7. Conclusion The role of the C-terminal L-barrel domain of the pancreatic lipase, as deduced from numerous biochemical data and a number of crystal structures, was de¢ned as an anchoring domain for its cofactor colipase. A more generalised function for this domain could be expected from the presence of analogous domains in other mammalian lipases which do not need colipase for activity. A diversi¢ed view on the function of this domain has come from crystal structures of enzymes with related, but di¡erent, functions and indicate a direct interaction of these domains with lipid particles/membranes. A direct interaction of the pancreatic lipase L-barrel domain with neutral detergent micelles has at least been observed in a crystal environment. Fundamental questions related to the possible other functions of colipase still remain unanswered and this is mainly due to our lack of knowledge, at the molecular level, of the protein interactions with lipid particles. To what extent do the colipase ¢ngers penetrate into the lipid layer? Are there speci¢c interactions with bile salts? What is the in£uence of colipase binding on the lipid organisation and is there any change in lipid distribution which could be bene¢cial for lipase action? These all are questions that remain open. Structural studies in solution between colipase and micelles are urgently needed. Structural analogues of colipase, observed and predicted, have not brought us any further in the understanding of the mechanism of colipase action. On the other hand, predicted structural analogy with colipase may suggest speci¢c membrane interactions for these other proteins. References
