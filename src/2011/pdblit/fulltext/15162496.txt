The TM1621 gene of Thermotoga maritima encodes a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDPD; EC: 3.1.4.46),1 with a molecular weight of 25,569 Da (residues 1­222) and a calculated isoelectric point of 5.2. The GPDP family of enzymes (PFAM: PF03009) has multiple homologues in bacteria, archea and eukaryotes, including a number of uncharacterized proteins in humans and higher eukaryotes. GPDPs are involved in glycerol metabolism and catalyze the reaction of glycerophosphodiester and water to alcohol and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate. They display broad specificity for glycerophosphodiesters, such as glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphoglycerol and bis(glycerophosphoglycerol), all of which are hydrolyzed by this enzyme.1,2 Here, we report the crystal structure of TM1621 determined using the semiautomated high-throughput pipeline of the Joint Center for Structural Genomics.3 The structure of TM1621 [Fig. 1(a)] was determined to 1.60 Å resolution using the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method. Data collection, model, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model includes one protein monomer (residues 1­222), one Na ion, and 449 water molecules. The Matthews' coefficient (Vm) for TM1621 is 2.22 Å3/Da and the estimated solvent content is 44.2%. The Ramachandran plot, produced by PROCHECK 3.4,4 shows that 95.2% of the residues are in the most favored regions and 4.8% in additional allowed regions. The TM1621 monomer is composed of eleven -strands ( 1­ 11), ten -helices (H1, H2, H4, H5, H7-H9, H11, H12,
©

H14), and four 310-helices (H3, H6, H10, H13) [Figs. 1(a,b)]. The total -strand, -helical, and 310-helical content is 22.6%, 34.5%, and 4.4% respectively. The TM1621 structure resembles a trios phosphate isomerase (TIM) / -barrel, that folds into an eight-stranded ( 1, 2, 6 ­ 11), parallel -sheet barrel with 12345678 topology surrounded by eight -helices (H1, H5, H7-H9, H11, H13, H14) [Figs. 1(a,b)]. A small additional domain (residues 36 ­ 80) comprised of three -strands ( 3­ 5) and three helices (H2­H4), is inserted in the second / motif between -strand 2 and helix H5 [Figs. 1(b), 2(a)]. An alignment of all available GDPD sequences identifies a cluster of strictly conserved residues (His6, Arg7, Glu15, Asn16, Glu33, Arg37, His48, Asp49, Glu97 and Lys99) contributed by the second and third / motif and the additional domain [Fig. 2(b)]. The conservation of these side-chains within a groove in the center of the TIM-barrel indicates a possible location for the GDPD active site. The crystallographic packing in the TM1621 structure suggests that a monomer is the biologically relevant form.

crystallography using the MAD method. The information reported here, in combination with further biochemical and biophysical studies, will yield valuable insights into the functional determinants of this protein family and the thermostability of these organisms. Materials and Methods. Protein production and crystallization. TM1621 (TIGR: TM1621; Swissprot: Q9X1V6) was amplified by PCR from Thermotoga maritima strain MSB8 genomic DNA using PfuTurbo (Stratagene) and primer pairs encoding the predicted 5 - and 3 -ends of TM1621. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pMH1, which encodes an expression and purification tag consisting of amino acids MGSDKIHHHHHH at the amino terminus of the full-length protein. The cloning junctions were confirmed by sequencing. Protein expression was performed in a selenomethionine-containing medium using the Escherichia coli methionine auxotrophic strain DL41. Lysozyme was added to the culture at the end of fermentation to a final concentration of 250 g/mL. Bacteria were lysed by sonication after a freeze­thaw procedure in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)] and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation at 3400 g for 60 min. The soluble fraction was applied to a metal chelate affinity resin (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and equilibrated with equilibration buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.8, 0.25 mM TCEP, 10% (v/v) glycerol,

A structural similarity search, performed with the coordinates of TM1621 using the DALI server,5 yields more than 60 TIM-barrel structures, with pyridoxine 5 phosphate synthase from E. coli (PDB: 1ho1)6 being the most closely related with an RMSD of 2.8 Å over 169 aligned residues with 12% sequence identity. Interestingly, none of the DALI hits contains the additional domain inserted in the second / motif. Moreover, a DALI search with the isolated domain (residues 36 ­ 80) did not yield a single structural homologue, indicating a novel domain with a new fold. Since the domain is an insert that is specific for GDPD proteins, we propose to refer to it as a GDPD-insert (GDPD-I) domain. According to the Fold and Function Assignment System (FFAS),7 TM1621 has one distant homologue in the T. maritima proteome, TM0137 (tryptophane synthase, trpA) with 17% sequence identity. Models for TM1621 homologues can be accessed at http://www1.jcsg.org/cgi-bin/ models/get_mor.pl?key TM1621. The TM1621 structure reported here contains a novel GDPD-I domain with a new fold and represents the first GDPD whose structure has been determined by X-ray

300 mM NaCl) containing 20 mM imidazole. The resin was washed with equilibration buffer containing 40 mM imidazole, and the protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM TCEP, 300 mM imidazole). Buffer exchange was performed to remove imidazole from the eluate, and the protein in buffer Q (20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM TCEP) containing 50 mM NaCl was applied to a resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 50 to 500 mM NaCl in buffer Q. Appropriate fractions were buffer exchanged into crystallization buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM TCEP) and concentrated for crystallization assays to 20 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore). The protein was crystallized using the nanodroplet vapor diffusion method8 with standard JCSG crystallization protocols.3 The crystallization solution contained 40% PEG-600 and 0.1M 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethane sulfonic acid (CHES) pH 9.5 (final pH 9.6). The crystals were indexed in the orthorhombic space group P21212 (Table I). Data collection. Diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (APS, Chicago, USA). Anomalous diffraction data from the selenomethionine-substituted protein crystal were collected at 100K on beamline 19BM using an APS-1 CCD detector at wavelengths corresponding to the inflection point ( 1 MADSe), the peak ( 2

MADSe) and the high energy remote ( 3MADSe) of a selenium MAD experiment. For refinement, a high resolution dataset ( 0) was collected to 1.6 Å. Data were integrated and reduced using the HKL package.9 Data statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure solution and refinement. The structure was determined from the selenomethione data by MAD phasing using the CCP4 suite10 and SOLVE/RESOLVE.11 Structure refinement was performed using TLS-refinement in REFMAC5,10 O,12 and Xfit.13 Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model includes one protein molecule (residues 1­222, plus four residues from the His-tag), one Na ion, and 449 water molecules. Validation and deposition. Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the models was accomplished using Procheck 3.4 and SFcheck 4.0.4,10 Figure 1(b) was adapted from PDBsum (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/pdbsum/), and all others were prepared with PYMOL (DeLano Scientific). Coordinates and experimental structure factors of TM1621 have been deposited with the PDB and are accessible under the code 1o1z. Acknowledgments.
