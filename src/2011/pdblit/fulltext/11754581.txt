Ribosome inhibiting proteins, RIPs, are a widespread family of toxic enzymes. Ricin is a plant toxin used as a poison and biological warfare agent; shiga toxin is a homologue expressed by pathogenic strains of E. coli. There is interest in creating effective antidote inhibitors to this class of enzymes. RIPs act by binding and hydrolyzing a specific adenine base from rRNA. Previous virtual screens revealed that pterins could bind in the specificity pocket of ricin and inhibit the enzyme. In this paper we explore a range of compounds that could serve as better platforms for inhibitor design. This establishes the importance of key hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for active-site complementarity. 8-Methyl-9-oxoguanine is a soluble compound that has the best inhibitory properties of any platform tested. The X-ray structure of this complex revealed that the inhibitor binds in an unexpected way that provides insight for future design. Several inhibitors of ricin were also shown to be inhibitors of shiga toxin, suggesting this program has the potential to develop effective antidotes to an important form of food poisoning.
Introduction Ribosome inhibiting proteins (RIPs) are found in a variety of higher plants and in certain pathogenic bacteria.1 These toxins are N-glycosidases that inactivate ribosomes by depurinating a key adenine from an invariant sequence of rRNA.2,3 The most well studied of these RIPs is ricin, a heterodimeric toxin isolated from Ricinus communis.4,5 Ricin has an LD50 of 1 µg/ kg body weight for mice, rats, and dogs and is 10 times more potent against rabbits.1 The toxic dose for humans is likely to be in the 0.1-1.0 µg/kg range, depending on the mode of administration, and ranks it among the most toxic substances known. Ricin was used in the famous "umbrella tip" assassination of Georgy Markov6 and was also used in an unsuccessful attempt to poison the famous Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn.7 Ricin was prepared by a militant antitax group, which planned to poison IRS personnel8 and has continued to be used in attempted murders9 and terrorist acts.10 There is therefore an interest in developing an effective antidote to the toxin. Ricin inhibitors may also be useful against the homologous proteins Shiga toxin (ST) and Shiga-like toxin type 1 (Stx1). ST is produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1, the organism first described by Kiyoshi Shiga following the 1896 dysentery epidemic in Japan.11 Pathogenic strains of E. coli, such as the infamous O157: H7 serotype, express Stx1. These enterohemmorhagic E. coli are implicated in a number of diseases such as hemorrhagic colitis, neonatal and adult diarrhea, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Only one conservative

amino acid change in the catalytic A subunit distinguishes ST from Stx1.12 These bacterial enzymes catalyze the same reaction as RTA and possess significant similarity in three-dimensional structure.13,14 RTA inhibitors are also being tested against the bacterial enzyme Stx1 and may lead to the design of drugs useful in treating enterbacterial outbreaks.15 The X-ray structure of intact heterodimeric ricin is known,16 and the enzymatic A chain of ricin, called RTA, has been described at higher resolution.14,17,18 Sitedirected mutagenesis, kinetic studies,19,20 and the binding of substrate analogues to the crystallaline RTA21 have provided crucial information about the mechanism of action. The adenine base binds in a specificity pocket between the side chains of tyrosines 80 and 123 and makes specific hydrogen bonds with the protein. When adenine binds into the specificity site of ricin, it must displace the side chain of Tyr 80 from the pocket, rotating it roughly 45° to a place where it stacks with the substrate ring. In the catalytic mechanism, Arg 180 appears to act as an acid to partially protonate the leaving base and Glu 177 stabilizes the transition state or serves as a base to activate the attacking water molecule. The parameters of the RTA structure and mechanism allowed a computerized virtual screen to be carried out that identified pteroic acid (PTA) as a likely inhibitor of the toxin. Subsequent kinetic measurements confirmed that PTA was a modest inhibitor of RTA action, and the X-ray structure of the complex confirmed that the proposed mode of binding was very similar to the observed binding.22 Pteroic acid is poorly soluble and has limited value as a lead compound for the design of effective inhibitors and useful RIP antidotes. Energy calculations were used to investigate likely binding modes of other potential inhibitors, including tautomers

of pterins and guanine.23 These calculations suggested that guanine-like compounds could interact strongly with the RTA specificity pocket, and this served as a basis for the design and synthesis of a series of inhibitors described in this work. Figure 1 shows a cartoon representation of the interactions made between the pterin moiety of pteroic acid and the specificity pocket of RTA. Our goal is to design inhibitors that will make favorable interactions with the functional groups in the active site and still possess improved solubility. Chemistry Most of the heterocyclic compounds evaluated here are commercially available or have been previously reported in the literature. The preparation of new compounds is briefly outlined here. The 5-amino-6Hoxazollo[5,4-d]pyrimin-7-one ring system (9-oxoguanine, e.g., 3) is relatively unexplored.24,25 We prepared 5-amino2-methyl-7-oxooxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine (3) by condensation of acetamidomalonate (1) with guanidine hydrochloride in sodium ethoxide/ethanol to afford 5-acetylamino-2-amino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (2) in 89% yield. Heating 5-acetylamino-2-amino-4,6-dihydroxy pyrimidine to 280-300 °C under vacuum afforded 5-amino-2methyl-6H-oxooxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidin-7-one (3, Scheme 1). The pyridothiadiazine ring system (e.g., 5) can be easily accessed from the corresponding amino sulfonamide.26 Heating a mixture of 3-aminopyridine-2-sulfonamide (4) and guanidine carbonate afforded 3-aminopyridothiadiazine (5, Scheme 2) in 31% yield. Pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines (7-deazapurines, e.g., 8) bearing pendent groups can be easily obtained from

Scheme 2

Manich reaction of these compounds with various secondary amines.27 5-(N,N-dibenzyl)aminomethyl-2octanoylaminopyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (6) was prepared is this way according to the literature procedure. Heating 6 with an excess of methyl 4-aminobenzoate in a sealed tube afforded the substitution product 5-(4-carbomethoxyphenylaminomethyl)-2-octanoylaminopyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (7), which was hydrolyzed to afford 5-(4-carboxyphenylaminomethyl)-2-octanoylaminopyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (8, Scheme 3). Results and Discussion A variety of aromatic compounds, shown in Table 1, were tested as inhibitors of ricin. Ricin recognizes the adenine base of its natural rRNA substrate and binds bicyclic pterin rings, as seen in the inhibitors PTA and neopterin.22 Even so, we felt it would be reasonable to explore the potential of single-ring compounds as inhibitors. One of the better single-ring inhibitors tested was 2,5-diamino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine, which possessed many of the hydrogen bonding attributes of the known pterin-based inhibitors. Its IC50 is 2.2 mM, similar to that seen for neopterin.22 To explore its mode of binding,

the inhibitor was cocrystallized with RTA and X-ray data were collected to 2.8 Å resolution. Despite being grown under conditions that typically yield monoclinic crystals, the crystals of the complex were triclinic with a ) 42.07 Å, b ) 65.95 Å, c ) 50.81 Å, R ) 93.90°, ) 112.4°,  ) 84.43° and two molecules, referred to here as A and B, form the asymmetric unit. A summary of crystallographic data for this, and other inhibitor complexes, is shown in Table 2. Molecule A binds the ligand, but molecule B does not. In addition, the shift from a monoclinic to a triclinic cell alters symmetry contacts between the protein molecules, which perturbs the conformation of several residues far from the active site. These include Arg 39, His 40, Glu 41, Thr 159, Asn 222, and Gln 223 in molecule A. Increased disorder eliminated electron density for Arg 39, and side chain density was no longer visible for His 40, Glu 41, and Thr. Even so, the overall conformation of RTA in the two crystals formed is very similar; the CR carbon positions of the triclinic protein differ from those of the monoclinic form by an rms value of 0.09 Å for molecule A and 0.07 Å for molecule B. Molecules A and B vary between themselves mostly in their surface-exposed C termini. The two molecules have an rms deviation of 0.07 Å for CR carbons. The binding of the inhibitor 2,5-diamino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (DDP) to the active site of RTA is shown in Figure 2. Unlike adenine analogues, or pterins, DDP does not displace the side chain of Tyr 80 from its apoenzyme conformation and fails to open the specificity pocket, that is, the portion of the active site that specifically binds adenine. Instead, the inhibitor is stacked against the side chain of Tyr 80 in its closed conformation. The interaction apparently stabilizes the inactive form of RTA, freezing the Tyr 80 side chain in a position that blocks access to the specificity pocket and thereby prevents the substrate adenine from being recognized. Because the single-ring inhibitor did not enter the RTA specificity pocket, it was precluded from making many specific interactions there and limited its usefulness as a platform for further experiments. As a consequence, we discontinued work on single-ring inhibitors. The specificity pocket of RTA is lined with hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, particularly those from the backbone atoms of Gly 121 and Val 80 shown in Figure 1, which guarantee the binding of adenine in the context

of natural RNA. These groups can be subverted by other ring systems, and we have previously seen that the pterin moiety of PTA and neopterin can be oriented to make more and stronger interactions than does adenine. Neither adenine nor adenosine inhibits ricin, whereas PTA is a modest inhibitor. We carried out a systematic survey of compounds with differing patterns of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors to try to maximize these interactions. Computer modeling23 suggested that 3-aminopyridothiadiazine would preserve many of the specific interactions observed for pterins but would juxtapose a partially negative sulfone with Arg 180 of RTA. Despite the suggestions of modeling, this compound, in fact, was not an inhibitor of the enzyme (Table 1). Because the pterin-like compounds were poorly soluble, we also undertook a study of guanine-like compounds. We had predicted from energy calculations that guanine, rotated roughly 180° around the long of the purine base (a line from C8 to the midpoint of the N1-C2 bond) with respect to the adenine orientation, could bind and inhibit RTA.23 As shown in Table 1, guanine has an IC50 of 0.9 mM. We also tested xanthine as an inhibitor. It had an IC50 of 3.6 mM, confirming the importance of the exocyclic amino group at the 2-position of the base. This amino group is expected to donate hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of Val 81 and Gly 121. Subsequent inhibitor candidates would all preserve the pyrimidine ring structure seen in guanine (that is, 2-amino6-hydroxypyridine). Table 1 shows the IC50 values for a number of bicyclic compounds that retained the six-membered ring of guanine. These include 8-mercaptoguanine, thiazolpyrimidine, 9-deazagunaine (9DG), 7-deazaguanine (7DG), 8-methyl-7-deazaguanine, and 8-methyl-9-oxoguanine (9OG). The IC50 values for these compounds range from 2.8 mM for 7DG to 0.4 mM for 9OG. The latter compound has the best IC50 of any platform compound we have measured, by a slight margin, but more importantly is very much more soluble in water. Since it had the potential to be a useful molecular platform for future inhibitor design, we attempted to solve the X-ray structure of the complex of this inhibitor with RTA. Soaking RTA crystals in 9OG caused them to crack. Useful crystals were formed by crystallizing the enzyme in the presence of the inhibitor. In addition, only cryocooled cocrystals survived exposure to X-rays. As shown in Table 1, the crystals were not perfectly isomorphous with native RTA crystals, and their dif-

fraction was limited to 3.1 Å, suggesting poor crystal order. Even so, an interpretable electron density map was produced, as shown in Figure 3. The binding orientation of 9OG in the RTA active site was unexpected. Although many of the anticipated pterin-like hydrogen bonds were formed, they were made in novel ways. This is illustrated in Figure 4 where the orientation of 9OG is compared with that of the pterin ring of PTA. The orientation of 9OG can be roughly generated from PTA by flipping the bicyclic ring system 180° around the long axis and then rotating it

60° around an axis normal to the page. In both cases the exocyclic amine group sits in a pocket where it donates hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl groups of Val 81 and Gly 121. At the same time a ring nitrogen accepts a hydrogen bond from the amido group of Val 81. These are key interactions also preserved in the binding of adenine substrate and formycin.21 Pterin-based inhibitors assume a high-energy tautomer to make the interactions described above and an additional one arising as follows. The low-energy tautomer of pterin has a hydrogen on N3, but this would

clash with the amido hydrogen of Val 81. As a consequence, RTA binds the pterin(3) tautomer with the hydrogen on N1, which it donates in a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly 121, as shown in Figure 4. The cost of this rearrangement is more than compensated for by the formation of the hydrogen bond.23 In the binding of 9OG, no such tautomerization is required because the low-energy form has the hydrogen

already at N1 (using guanine nomenclature, which differs from pterin nomenclature) available to donate a bond to O121. The novel orientation of 9OG also brings the carbonyl oxygen into a position to accept a hydrogen bond from the amido group of Tyr 123, an interaction not seen in PTA. In PTA, Arg 180 donates two hydrogen bonds to the exocyclic oxygen at position 4 and to the ring nitrogen at position 5. The 9OG orientation re-

quires the side chain of Arg 180 to rotate slightly and allows only one bond to be formed to the ring oxygen at position 9. If 9OG were oriented like PTA, and if the compound tautomerized to a form like guanine(4),23 it would seem that the same number of hydrogen bonds could be made as are made in the observed form. However, the strength of these hypothesized interactions is difficult to estimate and compare to those bonds actually observed. It can only be assumed that the unexpected orientation is energetically more favorable than a pterin-like orientation by a subtle amount; it may be that that the difference is simply the cost of the tautomerization. We also solved the X-ray structures of the 7DG and 9DG complexes with RTA to see if they would bind like the pterins or like 8-methyl-9-oxoguanine. Despite their differing pattern of hydrogen bonding groups, both compounds adopted a conformation like 9OG in the crystal. The binding is shown for 9DG in Figure 5. In this structure two water molecules make additional

interactions with the inhibitor, which were not present in the 9OG structure. In the 7DG complex (not shown) N9 of 7DG donates a hydrogen to the backbone carbonyl of Ala 79, an interaction not seen in other ligand complexes with RTA. Future design efforts will focus on adding pendant groups to a 9DG platform. These pendant groups, correctly oriented on an optimized scaffold heterocycle, will increase the binding of these compounds to provide more reasonable inhibition values. We investigated the binding of several 7DG-based structures shown in Table 1 to determine the preferable position for pendants to be attached. On the basis of the PTA structure and earlier predictions of guanine binding to RTA, the site of the p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) moiety linkage to pterin position 6 in PTA would be roughly superimposed with position 8 of a guanine pendant. It would seem to be sterically favored to add a linker on position 8 rather than position 7, given the predicted proximity of Arg 180 to position 7. However, 9OG, 7DG, and 9DG all bind in an orientation that places position 8 in van der Waals

contact with Arg 180. Interestingly, the IC50 values for the near-isomeric compounds N-4-[2-(2-amino-4(3H)oxo-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)ethyl]benzoic acid and 5-(4-carboxyphenylaminomethyl)2-octanoylaminopyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4(3H)-one shown in Table 1 are 0.6 and 0.7 mM. The fact that both molecules bind with essentially the same affinity suggests that both positions 7 and 8 are feasible for further design efforts. However, if one considers the IC50 data, PTA binding, the predicted binding of guanine-based compounds, and the observed binding of 9OG, 7DG, and 9DG to RTA as a whole, it seems likely that guanine-based molecules appended at position 8 will revert to the PTA binding mode. Future studies will investigate the inhibition of, and binding to, RTA by 9DG derivatives with larger pendants attached to position 8. Several RTA inhibitors were also tested against Shiga toxin. As described in the Experimental Section, Stx1A1, normally inhibitory to bacterial ribosomes,28 was produced in high yield from a new intein fusion. The results of the inhibition studies are shown in Table 3. Their IC50 values are in agreement with those for RTA, within the error associated with the activity assay. This confirms the prediction that competitive RTA inhibitors can be as effective against Shiga toxin. Experimental Section
1. Synthesis. All evaporations were carried out in vacuo with a rotary evaporator. Melting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover capillary melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Unless otherwise noted, 1H and 13C NMR spectra were determined in DMSO-d6 on a Varian spectrometer operating at 300 and 75.47 MHz, respectively. The chemical shift values are expressed in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane as internal standard. All mass spectra were obtained by chemical ionization using methane as the ionizing gas. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck silica gel 60 F254 plates with a fluorescent indicator. Proportions of solvents used for TLC are by volume. All solvents and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Fisher Scientific and were used as received. 2,6-Diamino-4-hydroxypyrimidine, 6-hydroxy-2,4,5-triaminopyrimidine, guanine, 2-amino-4-hydroxypyrimidine, 2-amino-6-hydroxy-8-mercaptopurine, and xanthine were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company. 2-Amino-4,6-dihydroxy-5-methylpyrimidine and 4-amino-6-hydroxy2-methylpyrimidine dihydrate were purchased from Acros. 2,5Diamino-4-hydroxypyrimidine,29 2,5-diamino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine,30 9-deazaguanine,31 2-amino-6-methyl-3,4-dihydro4-oxo-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine, and N-4-[2-(2-amino-4(3H)oxo-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)ethyl]benzoic acid32 were prepared according to the literature procedures.

Ricin and Shiga Toxin Inhibition 1.26 (bs, 8H, C7H15), 0.90 (bt, 3H, C7H15). HRMS calcd for (C23H29N5O4), 439.221 955; found, 439.221 475. To a solution of this methyl ester (103 mg, 0.234 mmol) in 500 µL of EtOH and 2 mL of H2O was added 5 M KOH (117.25 µL, 0.586 mmol). This mixture was stirred for 48 h, at which time the reaction became homogeneous. The solution was evaporated, the residue was dissolved in H2O, and the pH was adjusted to 7 with AcOH. The H2O was removed in vacuo, and MeOH was added to the residue. The mixture was centrifuged, and the MeOH was removed. More MeOH was added; this process was carried out three more times. The MeOH fractions were combined and evaporated, and the residue was applied to a flash silica gel chromatography column and eluted with 90: 9:1 CHCl3/MeOH/AcOH to afford the product as a yellow solid (66.2 mg, 95% yield). TLC Rf ) 0.09 (90:9:1 CHCl3/MeOH/ AcOH). 1H NMR (D2O):  7.64 (d, 10 Hz, 2H, C6H4), 6.79 (d, 10 Hz, 2H, C6H4), 6.61 (s, 1H, 6-CH), 4.33 (s, 2H, 5-CCH2NH). Anal. (C14H13N5O3 + H2O) C, H, N. 2. RTA Expression and RTA/Inhibitor in Vitro Activity. Recombinant RTA was overexpressed in E. coli as described.41 The activity of various RTA inhibitors was determined by an in vitro protein synthesis assay using Artemia salina ribosomes as described.41,22 Most inhibitors were solubilized in 0.045 N NaOH prior to addition to toxin-containing solutions. The ligand/toxin sample was diluted 5-fold upon addition to buffered ribosomes. The residual base did not alter the final pH of the reaction, pH 7.6, and did not affect protein synthesis. The final concentration of RTA was 2 nM for all assays. The concentration of ribosomes was typically 0.3 µM. 3. Crystallization of RTA,Inhibitor Complexes. RTA monoclinic crystals were grown for the purpose of studying inhibitor binding to the enzyme.42,17 Briefly, 30 µL of protein at 2.2-2.4 mg/mL in the mother liquor (75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 10 mM BME, 1 mM EDTA, 4.1% poly(ethylene glycol) MW 8000 (PEG 8000)) was suspended over 200 µL of mother liquor at 4 °C. Microseeds were transferred to the sitting drop for nucleation. The compounds 5-amino-2-methyl-6H-oxooxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidin-7-one (8-methyl-9-oxoguanine) and 2,5-diamino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine were cocrystallized under native RTA monoclinic crystal conditions with a final ligand concentration of 4 and 10 mM, respectively. The compound 7-deazaguanine was solubilized in 0.033 N NaOH. A total of 5 µL of the ligand solution was added to a 25 µL of RTA crystal drop for a 4-day soak. The final concentration of ligand was estimated to be 4 mM. The inhibitor 9DG was cocrystallized under RTA monoclinic conditions. A total of 5 µL of 9DG in 0.045 N NaOH was added to 25 µL of mother liquor to give an estimated 4 mM final concentration of ligand. 4. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination. Diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku Raxis IV area detector. X-rays were generated by a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator operated at 50 mV, 100 mA. Data were collected at room temperature for all crystals except RTA complexed with 8-methyl-9-oxoguanine. That crystal was soaked for 5 min in the mother liquor containing 15-25% PEG 8000 and was transferred to paratone oil. After removal of surface-bound water, the crystal was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and mounted in a nitrogen cold stream. The program DENZO was used to process the diffraction images, and SCALEPACK was used to reduce the data.43 The starting model used for molecular replacement was the monoclinic crystal form of recombinant RTA.17 The RTA,2,5-diamino-4,6dihydroxypyrimidine cocrystal was triclinic with a ) 42.07 Å, b ) 65.95 Å, c ) 50.81 Å, R ) 93.90°, ) 112.4°, and  ) 84.43°. A molecular replacement solution was found with two monomers in the asymmetric unit using EPMR (Kissinger and Gehlhaar, Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). XPLOR was used for model refinement and generating Fourier maps with amplitudes Fobserved (Fo) minus Fcalculated (Fc) and 2Fo - Fc.44 O was used for model building.45 5. Shiga-like Toxin Type 1 A Chain 1 (Stx1A1) Cloning, Expression, and Purification. Cloning of Stx1A1. A Stx1A1 gene was constructed with three histidines added to the naturally occurring three histidines at the C terminus.15,46

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, Vol. 45, No. 1 97 The hexa-His tagged protein was initially purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Because of unsatisfactory expression levels (0.1 mg/L), StxA1 was cloned into an intein-fusion vector pCYB2 (NEB). The intein protein was engineered on the C terminus of the Stx1A1 clone retaining the hexa-His tag. Expression of Stx1A1. To avoid premature expression of Stx1A1, the protein was expressed in BL21 salt inducible (BL21-SI) cells (Life Technologies). The cells were made competent by the RbCl2 method (http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/ protocols/rbcl.html) and were transformed with the Stx1A1intein plasmid. The transformed cells were then plated on LBAMP plates with no salt (LBON-AMP) to avoid induction of protein expression. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. A single colony was picked for inoculation of 10 mL cultures in LBON-AMP media; the AMP concentration used throughout the procedure was 100 µg/mL. The cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C to a density of about 0.5 OD600 and were added to 500 mL of LBON-containing AMP. After 2 h, protein expression was induced by adding 0.3 M NaCl. The cells were harvested 3 h later by centrifugation at 4068g in a GSA Sorvall rotor for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in column buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA) and broken twice by passage through a French Press cell (SLM Aminco Urbana, IL) at 1000 psi. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 94 000g for 1 h in a 42.1 Ti rotor (Beckman). Purification of Stx1A1. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography. The supernatant was loaded onto a preequilibrated chitin-binding domain (CBD) and 5 mL column (NEB). Column washing, intein on-column cleavage, and elution of the Stx1A1 protein was done according to the manufacturer's specifications. The highly pure tagfree protein was expressed at approximately 5-15 mg/L. Pure fractions were assessed by SDS-PAGE. Stx1A1 was then dialyzed into 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 75 mM NaCl.
