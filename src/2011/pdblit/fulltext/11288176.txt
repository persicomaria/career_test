ABSTRACT The crystal structures of a monoclinic and a triclinic form of the peanut lectin­lactose complex, grown at pH 4.6, have been determined. They contain two and one crystallographically independent tetramers, respectively. The unusual "open" quaternary structure of the lectin, observed in the orthorhombic complex grown in neutral pH, is retained at the acidic pH. The sugar molecule is bound to three of the eight subunits in the monoclinic crystals, whereas the combining sites in four are empty. The lectin­sugar interactions are almost the same at neutral and acidic pH. A comparison of the sugar-bound and free subunits indicates that the geometry of the combining site is relatively unaffected by ligand binding. The combining site of the eighth subunit in the monoclinic crystals is bound to a peptide stretch in a loop from a neighboring molecule. The same interaction exists in two subunits of the triclinic crystals, whereas density corresponding to sugar exists in the combining sites of the other two subunits. Solution studies show that oligopeptides with sequences corresponding to that in the loop bind to the lectin at acidic pH, but only with reduced affinity at neutral pH. The reverse is the case with the binding of lactose to the lectin. A comparison of the neutral and acidic pH crystal structures indicates that the molecular packing in the latter is directed to a substantial extent by the increased affinity of the peptide loop to the combining site at acidic pH.

Key words: lectins; quaternary association; carbohydrate specificity; molecular mimicry; ligand binding and molecular packing INTRODUCTION Legume lectins, which are the most thoroughly studied family of lectins,1,2 exhibit a characteristic fold, but have different sugar specificities and quaternary structures.3,4 Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin (PNA) is a 110-kDa, homotetrameric, nonglycosylated legume lectin, specific to galactose at the monosaccharide level. It binds with high affinity to the tumor-associated Thomsen­Friedenreich

antigenic disaccharide (Gal 1-3GalNAc). In fact, PNA is the first lectin to be identified as having high specificity for T-antigen. We have determined the crystal structures of the lectin at neutral pH in association with several sugars.5­9 The protein has also been engineered to enhance its potential use as a tool for diagnosing certain types of cancers.10,11 It has also served to highlight the variability in the quaternary association of legume lectins despite all of them having essentially the same tertiary structure.12 The most interesting feature of the structure of peanut lectin is perhaps its "open" quaternary association.13 Contrary to what is expected in the case of a tetrameric protein, the molecule has neither fourfold symmetry nor 222 (D2h) symmetry. A molecular dyad relates the two dimers in the tetramer. Each dimer is twofold symmetric. However, the three twofold axes neither intersect nor are perpendicular to one another. The protein, which is a tetramer at neutral pH, begins to dissociate into dimers at a pH 4.75 and turns completely dimeric by pH 3.0.14,15 It is known that PNA binds lactose with one order of magnitude less strongly at acidic pH than it does at neutral pH.14,15 In view of the protein's unusual quaternary association, it was important to investigate changes in quaternary structure, if any, and to study carbohydrate recognition at low pH. Toward this end, two crystal forms, one monoclinic and the other triclinic, of the protein complexed to lactose grown at pH 4.6 were analyzed. The study of peptide mimicry of carbohydrate binding in lectins has evinced considerable interest in recent times because of potential pharmacological applications16 ­19 and because the synthesis of a peptide is considerably simpler compared with carbohydrate synthesis. It was found that a peptide loop belonging to a symmetry-related

molecule interacts with the carbohydrate binding site in one of the subunits of the monoclinic form. The packing interactions are such that the same peptide stretch from two different subunits of neighboring molecules interacts with two carbohydrate-binding sites of the molecule in the triclinic form. Subsequently, the binding of the concerned peptide fragment to the lectin was studied in solution. An attempt also was made to rationalize the crystal packing in the orthorhombic (at neutral pH), monoclinic, and triclinic forms based on the interactions between the peptide loop and the combining site. MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization and Data Collection The protein was prepared by affinity chromatography on crosslinked arabinogalactan.20 Crystals of the PNA­ lactose complex, suitable for X-ray analysis, were grown at pH 4.6 under conditions described earlier.21 Although the triclinic crystal form was characterized previously,21 the monoclinic crystal form reported here is new. Crystallization attempts at lower pH ranges failed to yield diffracting crystals. Even at pH 4.6, good crystals grew only very rarely. The data from both the crystal forms were collected on a MAR-imaging plate system. Data from the triclinic and monoclinic forms were processed by using MAR-XDS22 and the DENZO/SCALEPACK23 suite of programs, respectively. The statistics pertaining to the data sets are in Table I. Data from the triclinic form extended only to 3.5 Å resolution. Structure Solution and Refinement The structures of the two crystal forms were solved by using molecular replacement (MR) techniques using the program AmoRe.24 The search model used in the calculations was derived from the orthorhombic structure of the PNA­lactose complex at neutral pH (PDB code: 2PEL; 2.25 Å resolution) after removing the sugar and water molecules from it. Data in the resolution range 15­3.5 Å were used in the molecular replacement calculations. The structure solution was straightforward, and the solution corresponding to the monoclinic form had correlation coefficient and R-factor of 65.5 and 33.8%. These values were 69.8 and 29% in the triclinic case. The crystal packing was examined in both the cases to make sure that there were no steric clashes between symmetry related molecules. XPLOR25 was used for refining both the structures in a similar manner. R-free26 was used throughout to monitor the progress of refinement. After an initial round of rigid body refinement, cycles of stereochemically restrained27 positional refinement28 were conducted. 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron density maps calculated at this stage showed clear density for lactose (Fig. 1a) in two subunits of one of the independent tetramers in the monoclinic form and in one subunit of the other tetramer. There was no sugar density in the remaining subunits (Fig. 1b). Some density, presumably for lactose, was observed in two subunits of the triclinic form, but no attempt was made to interpret it

because of the low resolution of the data. Noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were imposed throughout the refinement with an effective energy constant of 300 kcal/mol. To not average out genuine differences in the different kinds of subunits in the monoclinic form, subunits containing bound carbohydrate (A, B, and E), subunits with combining sites to which access is blocked by neighboring molecules (C and G) and subunits with unoccupied combining sites (D and H) in the monoclinic form were treated as separate groups during refinement. NCS constraints were applied only within each group. Sugar molecules were fitted in the three subunits and further refinements were conducted. Water molecules were added in steps after inspecting density maps. Water molecules were not added in the case of the triclinic form on account of the low resolution. Only the overall and group B-factors were refined. When the R-factor was 27%, a bulk solvent correction was applied to the data of the monoclinic form by using a "flat" solvent model.29 Omit maps30,31 were used and examined extensively to eliminate model bias. Luzzati plots32 calculated at the end of the refinements showed average errors in the coordinates of 0.30 and 0.37 Å, whereas the Cruickshank indices33 gave average coordinate errors of 0.38 and 0.81 Å, in the monoclinic and triclinic forms, respectively. The analysis of the geometrical parameters of the final structures, including the Ramachandran plots,34,35 using PROCHECK36 indicate that

the geometry is better than the average observed in other structures at comparable resolutions. The statistics pertaining to the refinement and geometry of the final model are in Table I. The coordinates and structure factors of the monoclinic (PDB code: 1CR7) and triclinic (PDB code: 1CQ9) forms have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank. Peptide Synthesis The peptides ( 80% purity) were purchased from Xcyton Ltd, Bangalore, India. They were purified by reversephase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C-18 (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) column using water/ acetonitrile gradient. The peptide was eluted in 22% acetonitrile. The purity and molecular weight were checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis Binding kinetics were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a BIAcore 2000TM biosensor system. The peptide was covalently immobilized on the certified grade CM5 sensor chips at concentrations of 40 g/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.6, using the amine coupling kit supplied by the manufacturer. Nearly 500 resonance

units of peptide was immobilized under these conditions, where 1 RU corresponds to immobilized peptide concentration of 1 pg/mm2. The unreacted moieties on the surface were blocked with ethanolamine. For the determination of association rate constants (k1), PNA (10 ­50 M), flowing at the rate of 10 L/min, in the same buffer was used. Dissociation rate constants (k 1), were evaluated by the same buffer at a flow rate of 10 L/min. The surface was regenerated by a 30-s pulse of 10 mM lactose flowing at 50 L/min. The surface was washed with the buffer for 1 min before the next injection. Rate constants, k1 and k 1 were obtained by fitting the primary sensogram data using the BIA evaluation 3.0 software. Association constants (Ka) for the binding of the peptides were calculated by the ratios of k1 & k 1, viz., Ka k1/k 1. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry All isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed by using an OMEGA high-sensitivity microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). A typical titration involved 15­20 injections at 3-min intervals of 6- L aliquots of peptide solution into the sample cell (volume 1.344 mL) containing PNA (50 M). The titration cell was stirred continuously at 400 rev/min. The heats of dilution of the peptides in the buffer alone were

subtracted from the titration data. The resulting data were then analyzed to determine the binding stoichiometry (n), association constant, and the enthalpy change ( Hb).37 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Three-Dimensional Structure and Quaternary Association As in the case of the orthorhombic form5 grown at neutral pH, electron density exists only for 232 of the 236 residues in all the subunits in the monoclinic and the triclinic forms grown at pH 4.6. The remaining four C-terminal residues are presumably disordered. The secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures in the neutral and acidic pH forms are virtually identical. In fact, the tetramer in the orthorhombic form superposes on the two crystallographically independent tetramers in the monoclinic form with an r.m.s deviation of 0.4 Å in C positions in both the cases. The r.m.s deviation in C positions between the tetramers in the orthorhombic and triclinic forms is still lower at 0.1 Å. Thus, the unusual "open" quaternary structure of the protein, without the expected fourfold or 222 symmetry, observed at neutral pH is retained at pH 4.6 (Fig. 2). Occupancy of the Combining Sites The two tetramers in the monoclinic form will be referred to as ABCD (consisting of subunits A, B, C, and D) and EFGH (consisting of subunits E, F, G, and H). The state of occupancy in these two tetramers and the tetramer in the triclinic form is schematically illustrated in Figure 3. Lactose is bound to 3 (A, B, and E) of the eight subunits in the monoclinic form. The combining site is not accessible, particularly on account of the obstruction by the 27­31 loop in a neighboring molecule, in two subunits (C and G). In two other subunits (D and H), the combining

site is accessible, but unoccupied. Another interesting situation prevails in the remaining subunit (F). A peptide stretch belonging to loop 49 ­ 63 of subunit H in a symmetryrelated molecule interacts with the carbohydrate-binding site of this subunit. The same kind of interactions exist in two subunits (A and B) of the triclinic form as well. There are blobs of density that could correspond to sugar molecules in the other two subunits (C and D) in the triclinic form, but the comparatively low resolution of the structure does not permit a detailed interpretation of these blobs. The 12 crystallographically independent subunits in the two forms, thus have empty combining sites and those involved in interactions with lactose and with a peptide loop. Lectin-Carbohydrate Interactions The carbohydrate-binding site in PNA is made up of residues in the four loops 91­106, 125­135, 75­ 83, and 211­216. The 211­216 loop (the D-loop)38 is involved in conferring carbohydrate specificity.39 The PNA­lactose interactions, including water bridges, in subunits A, B, and E are summarized in Table II and illustrated in Figure 4a. They are identical to those that occur at neutral pH, except for one interaction (Glc O3 . . . Leu212 N). The distance between Leu212 N and Glc O3 is slightly 4 Å at neutral pH. In all the three subunits in pH 4.6 monoclinic form, the distance is 3.5 Å, indicating the possibility of a hydrogen bond although the Leu212 N-H . . . O3 Glc angle is somewhat low at an average value of 118°. The sugar-bound subunits in the monoclinic crystals have the same conformation as in the orthorhombic pH 7.0 crystals. The conformation of lactose also remains the same in neutral and low pH forms. However, Glc O3 and Leu212 N move slightly toward each other to make the additional Leu212 N . . . Glc O3 interaction, referred to earlier, possible. Specifically, Leu212 N is displaced by

of the low pH monoclinic form, whereas six exist in subunits A and B. Thus, the change in pH does not seem to introduce any substantial change in the geometry of the lectin­ carbohydrate interactions. The r.m.s deviations in the C positions in the four loops (91­106, 125­135, 75­ 83, and 211­216) that constitute the combining site in subunit 1 in the orthorhombic form and subunit A in the monoclinic form is as low as 0.23 Å. The side-chain atoms in the loops that exhibit a deviation of 1 Å belong to Lys77, Asp78, Asp93, Glu95, and Asn131. None of these residues is involved in protein­ carbohydrate interactions. Unoccupied Combining Sites There are altogether four unoccupied combining sites belonging to subunits C, D, G, and H in the monoclinic crystals. All the sites are occupied by one sugar molecule or another in all the crystals grown at neutral pH.5,9 Indeed, peanut lectin can be crystallized only in the presence of sugar. In fact, the four subunits referred to above are the only unliganded peanut lectin subunits observed so far. Therefore, they provide a database for exploring the changes in the site brought about by ligand binding. Of the four subunits, C and G have the entry into the combining site blocked by the steric hindrances produced by neighboring molecules. Indeed, loops of the neighboring molecules protrude into the combining sites, although they do not interact with the sites. Thus, only subunits D and H can be considered to have truly empty combining sites. The geometry of the combining site remains the same in the carbohydrate-bound subunits A, B, and E and free subunits D and H. The r.m.s deviation in C positions in the four loops between occupied and empty combining sites vary between 0.21 and 0.27 Å. No major changes are observed in the positions of side-chain atoms as well. It is interesting that W2, W4, and W5 exist in D and H. W3 is also seen in the combining site of subunit H. In addition,

0.21, 0.18, and 0.21 Å toward the sugar in subunits A, B, and E from the superposed position of this atom in subunit 1 of the orthorhombic form. The corresponding displacements of Glc O3 toward the D-loop are 0.82, 0.50, and 0.83 Å. In subunit A, in addition to this interaction, Glc O6 hydrogen bonds to Asp193 side chain of the subunit H of a neighboring molecule. The sugar atoms are also involved in a number of intermolecular contacts with this subunit. Presumably, because of these interactions, the average B-value of the sugar atoms in subunit A is low (see Materials and Methods). It is of interest that the water structure associated with the PNA­lactose complex is also substantially conserved with respect to variation of pH. The structure9 at neutral pH involves seven relatively invariant water molecules, designated W1­W7 (Fig. 4a). Of these, W1 and W2 are involved in bridging Gal O2 to the lectin. W3 and W4 do not interact with the sugar in the lactose complex, but bridge the GalNAc O7 to the lectin in its complex with T-antigen.6 The remaining three water molecules also do not interact with the sugar molecule. W5 interacts with Tyr130 OH, whereas W6 and W7 interact with W4 and/or W3. All the seven water molecules are present in subunit E

quent work on the basic lectin from winged bean (WBAI),48,49 however, showed that the specificity determining fourth loop in this galactose-binding lectin moves by 0.6 Å on ligand binding. On the other hand, as shown above, the binding site remains unchanged in the galactosespecific peanut lectin. Thus, it does not seem to be possible to unambiguously correlate primary sugar specificity with alterations in the combining site of legume lectins. A feature that the combining sites of Glc/Man- and Gal/ GalNAc-specific lectins share is the tendency of water molecules to occupy positions corresponding to sugar hydroxyls in the unliganded forms. Molecular Mimicry and Lectin-Peptide Interactions Molecular mimicry, especially those involving carbohydrate/peptide mimics, is a topic of considerable current interest.50,51 The selection of peptides that bind concanavalin A at the combining site from a random peptide library16 ­18 has been among the early studies on this topic involving lectins. The crystal structure of a concanavalin A-peptide complex19 provided the first example of a structural characterization of the interactions of a peptide with the combining site of legume lectins. The monoclinic crystals of peanut lectin provide the second example of peptide carbohydrate mimicry that has been fully characterized structurally. As indicated earlier, the combining site of subunit F is occupied by a peptide stretch that is part of the 49 ­ 63 loop of subunit H of a neighboring molecule, as shown in Figure 5. In fact, the 53­58 peptide stretch of the loop binds tightly to the site. The possible hydrogen bonds involved in stabilizing the association are listed in Table III. It is of interest that none of them mimic the four invariant interactions at the primary site (Asp83 OD1 . . . Gal O3, Asp83 OD2 . . . Gal O4, Gly104 N . . . Gal O3, and Asn127 ND2 . . . Gal O3) observed in all legume lectins. The Asp80 OD2 . . . Gal O6 hydrogen bond in the lactose complex is mimicked by a Asp80 OD1 . . . Ser57 OG interaction in the

water molecules occur at distances of 0.87, 1.16, 0.71, and 0.63 Å from the positions corresponding to galactose O2, O3, O4, and O5, respectively, in subunit D (Fig. 4b). In subunit H, water molecules occur close to (0.30 and 1.53 Å) positions corresponding to galactose O2 and O3. The unliganded and liganded structures of mannose/ glucose-specific pea lectin,40 Lathyrus ochrus lectin I41,42 and lentil lectin,43 indicated substantial changes in the binding site on carbohydrate binding. Concanavalin A was an exception where no change was observed in the binding site on carbohydrate binding except for an adjustment of Tyr100 to accommodate the saccharide.44,45 However, the galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine specific lectins, Griffonia simplicifolia lectin IV46 and Erythrina corallodendron lectin,47 do not exhibit such changes on ligand binding. This prompted the suggestion,47 albeit with reservations, that galactose-specific legume lectins could have binding sites more preformed than those of Glc/Man-specific legume lectins, where small conformational changes may be needed to optimize interactions with sugar. The subse-

peptide association. In the peptide association, Ala58 O in the loop takes the place of Glc O3 in the lactose complex. Indeed, when subunit A along with the lactose molecule is superposed on subunit F, the Ala58 O . . . Glc O3 distance is only 0.98 Å. Thr59 O mimics Glc O1 with a Thr59 O . . . Glc O1 distance of 1.16 Å, whereas the Thr59 OG1 . . . Glc O6 distance is 1.24 Å. In the carbohydrate complex, the side chain of Tyr125 stacks against the galactose ring. In the association with the peptide loop, the hydroxyl group of tyrosine forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Arg53 and Ser56 of the loop. Yet another additional interaction is between Ser126 O of the combining site and the side chain of Arg53 in the loop. Confirmation of Molecular Mimicry Through Solution Studies As illustrated in Figure 5, the three contiguous residues 56, 57, and 58, which interact with the carbohydratebinding site of a neighboring molecule, occur at the bottom of a U-shaped stretch. A decapeptide (54 ­ 63, IWSSATGNVA, peptide A) corresponding to this stretch was used for solution studies. The side chain of Arg53, which is adjacent to this stretch, also interacts with the lectin. Therefore, another decapeptide encompassing residue 53 and residues 56 ­58 (PVRIWSSATG, peptide B) was also used. The binding of these peptides and lactose to the lectin was studied by using ITC (Fig. 6a) at pH 4.6 and 7.4. The results obtained at the lower pH at different salt concentrations are given in Table IV. The peptides had negligible binding in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 containing 150 mM NaCl. On the contrary, lactose binds to the lectin with an association constant of 2.6 103 M 1 in the buffer at that pH. SPR studies (Fig. 6b) conducted at pH 4.6 and pH 7.4 on the two peptides at a concentration of 150 mM corroborate the above findings. The binding constants of peptides A and B at pH 4.6 are 1.5 and 3.8 10 3 M 1, respectively, whereas no binding was discernible at pH 7.4. The above results clearly show that the protein­protein interaction observed in the crystal structures is not an artifact of crystal packing; it represents molecular mimicry. In fact, the binding of the peptides at low pH is as strong as that of the sugar at neutral pH. The lectin does

The results of the solution studies are also in conformity with the interactions observed in the crystal structure. Both the peptide stretches are involved in hydrogen bonds formed by residues 56 ­58. The stretch corresponding to peptide B has additional interactions involving the guanidyl group of Arg53. Consequently, the association constants determined by ITC and SPR are higher for peptide B. The association constant decreases when the NaCl concentration is increased in both cases. But this effect is more pronounced in the case of peptide B, presumably because of the involvement of the guanidyl group in the interactions. Crystal Packing Driven by Peptide Specificity The unit cell dimensions of the monoclinic crystals, hereafter referred to as a , b , c , and resemble those of the orthorhombic form (P21212; a 129.3, b 126.9, c 76.9 Å). a and a and b and b have nearly the same values. c sin is 76.9 Å, which is the same as c. The geometrical relationship between the two cells is illustrated in Figure 7. The cell appears to be sheared by 37.5 Å (0.29 in fractional coordinates) along a when going from the orthorhombic to the monoclinic system. In addition, both the tetramers in the monoclinic form are rotated by 35° about an axis parallel to a with respect to that in the orthorhombic form. Both the crystal structures can be described as consisting of layers parallel to the ac plane, the adjacent planes being related by a 21 screw in each case. A close examination showed that the emphasis between the two structures is facilitated if translations of a 1/4 and c 1/2 were applied to the molecules in the orthorhombic form. The arrangements of molecules, after applying the above translations, in a layer each perpendicular to b in the orthorhombic and monoclinic forms are illustrated in Figure 8. The arrangement of molecules in the orthorhombic form (Fig. 8a) is relatively simple. An examination of intermolecular approaches closer than 4 Å shows that each molecule is in contact with six surrounding molecules. Of a total of 190 contacts, 39 are with a molecule translated by c and another 39 with one translated by c. Two screwrelated molecules and two of their translational equiva-

lents account for 108 contacts in the ab plane. The shear along a and the rotations of the tetramers lead to a different packing arrangement in the monoclinic crystals (Fig. 8b). Tetramer ABCD is in contact with two tetramers of the same type and with six tetramers of EFGH type accounting for a total number of 154 intermolecular interatomic contacts. Tetramer EFGH is surrounded by four tetramers of the same type and six tetramers of the ABCD type. The total number of atomic contacts are 264. Thus, tetramer EFGH makes far more intermolecular contacts than tetramer ABCD does. More importantly, there are differences in the nature of the contacts as well. In particular, tetramer ABCD does not make any contact with its own equivalent generated by a c translation. Tetramer EFGH, on the other hand, has 48 interatomic contacts with the tetramer generated by c and another 48 with the one generated by c . This difference between

Fig. 8. Stereo view of the packing of the tetramers in a layer perpendicular to b and b in the (a) orthorhombic and (b) monoclinic forms, respectively. Subunit A is colored black in (a), whereas the independent tetramers in (b) are shaded differently for clarity.

the two tetramers is clearly discernible from Figure 9b. It is of interest 34 of the 48 contacts between c -related tetramers EFGH involve the association between residues 53­58 in the 49 ­ 63 loop of subunit H in one tetramer and the carbohydrate binding site in subunit F of the other tetramer. Thus, the changes in crystal packing induced by the reduction in pH appears to have been directed by the increased affinity of the peptide to the combining site. The combining site in only one of the eight crystallographically independent subunits in the monoclinic crystals is involved in specifically binding the peptide stretch. In the triclinic crystals, however, two of the four subunits are involved in such binding. Both of them are involved in directing the packing in these crystals (Fig. 9). The 49 ­ 63 loop of subunit D of a translational equivalent along c interacts with the combining site of subunit A, leading to the formation of a chain of molecules along c. Understandably, the c axes in the monoclinic and triclinic crystals have the same length. A similar chain is formed along the [01-1] direction on account of the interaction of the loop in subunit C of a neighboring molecule with the combining site of subunit B. The intermolecular distance along this chain is 85.1 Å, a value close to the c dimension.

CONCLUSIONS The most striking feature of the peanut lectin molecule at neutral pH has been its unusual quaternary structure without the expected fourfold or 222 symmetry, which violated a well-established principle of subunit association. The structures of the crystal forms grown at acidic pH show that the unusual mode of subunit association is retained even at a pH close to that at which the molecule dissociates into dimers. They also show that the details of peanut lectin­sugar interactions are the same at neutral and acidic pH. A comparison of the occupied and unoccupied combining sites in the monoclinic crystals indicate that the geometry of the site is unaffected by ligand binding. An unanticipated feature of the low pH crystal forms is the tight interaction between a specific loop of a neighboring molecule with the combining site in some subunits. The demonstration that oligopeptide sequences corresponding to the loop bind to peanut lectin in solution indicates that the association observed in the crystals represents the structural characterization of true molecular mimicry. Indeed, the increased affinity of the peptide stretch to

the combining site at low pH is strong enough to drive the packing of molecules in the crystals.
