Abstract Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), a Gram-negative bacterium, is a common cause of hospital-acquired bacterial infections worldwide. Tellurium (Te) compounds, although relatively rare in the environment, have a long history as antimicrobial and therapeutic agents. In bacteria, tellurite (TeO3À2) resistance is conferred by the ter (Ter) operon (terZABCDEF). Here, on the basis of 2593 restraints derived from NMR analysis, we report the NMR structure of TerB protein (151 amino acids) of KP (KP-TerB), which is mainly composed of seven a-helices and a 310 helix, with helices II to V apparently forming a four° helix bundle. The ensemble of 20 NMR structures was well-defined, with a RMSD of 0.32 6 0.06 A for ° for heavy atoms, respectively. A unique property of the KP-TerB backbone atoms and 1.11 6 0.07 A structure is that the positively and negatively charged clusters are formed by the N-terminal positively and C-terminal negatively charged residues, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the protein sequence and structures of KP-TerB are unique. Keywords: Klebsiella pneumoniae; four-helix bundle; tellurite resistance; NMR structure Tellurium (Te) compounds, although relatively rare in the environment, have a long history as antimicrobial and therapeutic agents (Zadik et al. 1993). Oxyanions of tellurium, like tellurite (TeO3À2), are highly toxic for most microorganisms (Taylor 1999). It has been suggested that the toxicity of tellurite stems from its ability to act as a strong oxidizing agent over a variety of cell components (Summers and Jacoby 1977; Turner et al. 1999), which might interfere with many cellular enzyme processes. As recently demonstrated, the oxidative damage attributed to potassium tellurite is due at least in part to the intracellular generation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide radical (Perez et al. 2007). An alternative suggestion is that tellurite could replace sulfur in various cellular functions with catastrophic consequences (Walter and Taylor 1992). Tellurite-resistant bacteria do exist in nature, and they often reduce tellurite to its elemental less toxic form Te°, which is accumulated as black deposits inside the cell (Avazeri et al. 1997; Moscoso et al. 1998). Moreover, genes associated with tellurite resistance (Ter) are found in many pathogenic bacteria and are mostly conferred by highly specific genetic determinants (Walter and Taylor 1992). In general, five genetically distinct chromosomal and plasmid borne bacterial tellurite resistance systems have been described on the basis of DNA homology and/or hybridization experiments and knowledge of their mechanism of resistance (Turner et al. 1995), and are clearly unrelated to one another at either the DNA or protein level. In spite of the fact that a number of tellurite-resistance determinants have been characterized, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this resistance. Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), a Gram-negative bacterium, is a common cause of hospital-acquired bacterial infections worldwide; these include nosocomial pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia, particularly in immunocompromised patients. It is one of the top 785

five pathogenic bacteria causing community and hospital pneumoniae infection in Taiwan. A gene cluster encoding an Escherichia coli terZABCDE homolog was identified in the large virulence plasmid pLVPK of Klebsiella pneumoniae CG43 (Chen et al. 2004). This gene cluster, in addition to conferring tellurite resistance, also provides resistance to infection by various bacteriophages, such as l and T5, known as phage inhibition (Phi), as well as resistance to pore-forming colicins (PacB) (Walter and Taylor 1992; Whelan et al. 1995, 1997). However, the precise functions of each protein in the ter gene cluster are unknown. To gain an insight into its structure­ function relationship, we determined the 3D NMR solution structure of a tellurite-resistance protein, KP-TerB (151 amino acids), from Klebsiella pneumonia. The KPTerB consists of seven a-helices and a short 310 helix after helix III. Comparisons of KP-TerB with all other proteins in the databank failed to find any sequences and structures similar to those of KP-TerB, indicating that KP-TerB is a novel structure.

Results Resonance assignments and secondary structure The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, shown in Figure 1A, demonstrates that KP-TerB gave superb NMR data. We have assigned the NMR resonances of backbone 15N, 1 N 1 a 13 H , H , C9 nuclei for all residues except Met1, Ser2, and Phe3. These resonances were probably unassigned due to a fast exchange rate with H2O. Furthermore, over 97% of side-chain 1H and 13C resonances were assigned. The consensus chemical shift index (Wishart and Sykes 1994), generated using 1Ha, 13Ca, 13Cb, and 13C9 chemical shifts, showed that TerB is composed almost exclusively of a-helical structures (data not shown). Structure determination The 3D structure of KP-TerB was determined on the basis of 2593 distance restraints, 108 hydrogen bonds, and 198 dihedral angle restraints. The structure of KP-TerB, as

shown in Figure 1B, consists of seven a-helices, helix I (residues 14­22), helix II (residues 31­42), helix III (residues 51­62), helix IV (residues 71­84), helix V (residues 89­101), helix VI (residues 107­122), and helix VII (residues 130­142). A short 310 helix (residues 63­66) is found after helix III. High-resolution structures of KPTerB, with backbone and heavy atom RMSDs of 0.32 and ° 1.11 A, respectively, are shown in Figure 1C. Ramanchandran plot (plot not shown) revealed that 65.8% of the residues are in the most favored regions, 22.4% in allowed regions, 9.7% in generously allowed regions, and 2.1% in the disallowed regions. The structural statistics on the final set of 20 structures are given in Table 1. Discussion Solution structure of KP-TerB is composed of seven ahelices and a 310 helix. The tertiary fold, hence, is heavily dependent on the orientations of these helices. A number of long-range NOEs were observed for the residues in helices II to V so that the helix orientations were welldefined and unique, indicating that these helices may

form a four-helix bundle. In addition, several long-range NOEs could be seen between helix I and II, I and IV, and I and the 310 helix; the orientation of helix I is therefore quite fixed. Helix VI not only has several long-rang NOEs with helix V, but also with helix VII, the orientation of helix VI is thus also well-defined. By contrast, the orientation of helix VII could not be accurately determined because only a few of long-range NOEs could be detected between helices VI and VII. Based on amide­ proton exchange rate results, we found that helices II, IV, V, and VI, with very slowly exchanged amide protons, are more stable than the other a-helices. As expected, these slowly exchanged amide protons are hydrogen bonded or located in the core region. Resonance assignment shows that several residues are located in very upfield regions, which are primarily due to the ring-current effect, as KPTerB contains 12 Phe and two Tyr residues. For example, the unusual upfield-resonances of side-chain methyl groups of V43 and V68 are apparently due to the ringcurrent effect of F85 and F69, respectively. About 31% of the residues of KP-TerB are charged, including 25 negatively charged (11 Asp and 14 Glu) and 22 positively charged (8 Arg and 14 Lys) residues. Interestingly, the surface structure clearly shows that the positively and negatively charged clusters are mainly formed by the Nterminal half of the positively charged residues, and by the C-terminal half of negatively charged residues, respectively (Fig. 2A). In addition, three hydrophobic cores are clearly seen (Fig. 2B). The first hydrophobic core is composed of the hydrophobic residues in the Nterminal loop and a4. The second hydrophobic core is formed mainly by the four-helix bundle, residues V37, I41, A42, V43 of a2, I57, F59, and L60 of a3, V74, F77, L81, and F85 of a4, and L89, Y99, L100, and L101 of a5. The last hydrophobic core is located between a6 and a7. To gain insight into structure/function relationship, we performed a structural similarity search using DALI, a structural homology server (Holm and Sander 1996), and found that 13 proteins have Z-score over 3.0. Among these proteins, a homology model of the transmembrane regions of CCR1 (PDB 1Y5D) has the highest Z-score of 3.7. The remaining proteins are four transferases, two hydrolases, two unknown functions, one cell adhesion, one electron transport, one viral proein, and one chaperone. As the Z-score is not significant and functions of these selected proteins are variable, it is unlikely to be able to derive the biological function for KP-TerB only based on the DALI search. However, to the best of our knowledge, KP-TerB is the first reported 3D solution structure among all tellurite resistance proteins. The 1H, 13 C, and 15N chemical shifts at 298 K and pH 6.0 have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under BMRB accession number 15574, and the structure ensemble has been deposited in the PDB (accession 2jxu).

Materials and Methods Protein expression and purification
DNA encoding TerB was amplified from a K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044 cDNA library. The polymerase chain reaction product, coding for eight additional amino acids (LEHHHHHH) at the C terminus to facilitate purification, was cloned as an NdeI/ XhoI fragment into a modified pET­29b vector (Novagen). The recombinant KP-TerB protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 with IPTG induction and purified by immobilized metal (Ni) affinity chromatography. The purity assessed by SDS-PAGE was >90%. The protein was characterized by its molecular weight on SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. MOPS minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl or both 15NH4Cl and 13C6-glucose was used to prepare the 15N- or 13C/15N-labeled protein, respectively.

NMR measurements
NMR samples (0.3 mL; about 1.5 mM protein) were prepared in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, in 90% H2O/10% D2O, and placed in a Shigemi NMR tube. All NMR experiments were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker 800 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe. All heteronuclear NMR experiments were performed as described in review articles (Bax et al. 1994; Kay 1995). The sequential connectivities were identified using

CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCO, HNCACO, and C(CO)NH. The 1H resonances were assigned using TOCSY-HSQC, HBHA (CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY. Side-chain 13C resonances were obtained from C(CO)NH and HCCH-TOCSY. The side-chain NH2 protons of Asn and Gln were identified using 2D 1H-15N HSQC and 3D NOESY-HSQC. Aromatic 13C and 1H resonances of 12 phenylalanine and two tyrosine residues in KP-TerB were all assigned using 2D 1H-13C HSQC, 2D NOESY, 2D TOCSY, (Hb)Cb(CgCd)Hd, and (Hb)Cb(CgCdCe)He data. The two Pro residues (Pro107 and Pro146) in the sequence were assigned by sequential connectivities and determined as trans using the characteristic NOE of dad(i, i + 1) from the 3D 13C-NOESY data. All spectra were processed by XWIN-NMR and analyzed using AURELIA on an SGI O2 workstation. Linear prediction was applied in the 15N and 13C dimensions to improve the digital resolution. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as an external chemical shift standard at 0.00 ppm. The 15N and 13C chemical shifts were indirectly referenced using the consensus ratios of the zero-point frequencies at 298 K (Wishart et al. 1995).

Structure calculation
The 6 His-tagged residues (HHHHHH) at the C terminus were not used in the structure calculation, as they are unstructured. However, the protease cleaved site (LE) in the front of

His-tagged could be unambiguously assigned, and were therefore used in structure calculation. Distance restraints were obtained from two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and 3D 13C- and 15N-edited NOESY experiments. Distance restraints were grouped into five distance ° ° ° ° ranges, 1.8­2.6 A, 1.8­3.6 A, 1.8­5.0 A, 1.8­5.5 A, and 1.8­ ° 6.0 A, according to the peak intensity. Dihedral F and C angle restraints were determined from the chemical shift data using the TALOS program (Cornilescu et al. 1999). Hydrogen bond constraints were derived from slowly exchanging amide protons indicated by 15N-HSQC recorded after exchange of KP-TerB with deuterated buffer for 16 h at room temperature. Structure calculations were performed using the XPLOR-NIH program (Schwieters et al. 2003). The PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski et al. 1996), and MOLMOL (Koradi et al. 1996) were used to analyze the final structures.
