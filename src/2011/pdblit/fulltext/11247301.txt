in rapid internalization and lysosomal targeting (2 ­ 4). These motifs have been identified primarily by mutagenesis experiments in which non-conservative substitution of any critical residue in the motif abolishes or severely impairs internalization activity of the protein when expressed in cells. Sequences unrelated to known motifs can function as internalization signals (5), suggesting that some sorting determinants may not be recognizable by primary structure and/or that there may be other motifs yet to be identified. The heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor complex recognizes proteins containing tyrosine- and dileucine-based sorting determinants at the cell surface to drive rapid internalization (6,7). Adaptor complexes each contain two heavy chains, a medium (m) and a small (s) chain. Ohno et al. (8) showed that YxxF determinants interact with the m subunit of the AP-2 complex (m2 adaptin). Subsequent work showed that many YxxF motifs also interact with m chains of AP-1 and AP-3 adaptors, which function at intracellular sites, with the relative affinities for each m subunit influenced by the residues in the Y+1 and Y+2 positions (9 ­ 12). Recently, X-ray crystallography of peptides containing YxxF motifs (corresponding to sequences from TGN38 and EGF receptors) bound to the COOH-terminal signal-binding domain of m2 adaptin have provided a structural insight into this sorting interaction (13). The YxxF motif binds in an extended conformation, with both the tyrosine side chain and the hydrophobic side chain at the Y + 3 position in direct contact with binding pockets in m2 adaptin, while the two intervening residues interact with m2 adaptin primarily through the peptide backbone. This work provides an explanation of the sequence specificities observed in the YxxF motifs. P-selectin, a cell adhesion protein expressed in endothelial cells and platelets, functions in inflammation and wound healing by binding to a high-affinity ligand expressed on neutrophils and monocytes (14,15). It is sorted into regulated secretory granules (16­ 18) then rapidly mobilized to the cell surface upon activation of granule exocytosis, exposing P-selectin to the bloodstream (15). Rapid internalization of P-selectin (19,20), followed by selective sorting from early to late endosomes (21,22), provides temporal regulation for its binding activity in inflammatory responses. The cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin is highly conserved in mammals, perhaps reflecting its role in the multiple sorting reactions necessary for correct trafficking of the protein (Figure 1). However, despite extensive mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic domain (18,20,23), discrete recognizable sorting motifs have not been identified. Analysis of the internalization activity of P-selectin by mutagenesis (20) did not identify any single-amino acid substitution that abolished internalization activity. Indeed, despite the presence of a YxxF-like

Internalization signals of the YxxF type (F= bulky hydrophobic side chain) interact with the m2 chain of AP-2 adaptors. Internalization activity is intolerant of non-conservative substitution of either the tyrosine or the F side chains, which bind to hydrophobic pockets in m2 adaptin in a conformation described as `a two pinned plug into a socket'. P-selectin, a type I transmembrane protein, contains the YxxF-like sequence YGVF in its cytoplasmic domain, but substitution of either the tyrosine or phenylalanine with alanine in the full-length protein causes only small changes in the rate of endocytosis. It is shown here that the sequence YGVF contained within a peptide corresponding to the 17 COOH-terminal amino acids of P-selectin binds to m2 adaptin in the same fashion previously seen for other YxxF motifs. In addition, the P-selectin peptide binds to a third hydrophobic pocket in m2 adaptin through a leucine at position Y-3 in the peptide. This structure suggests that some sequences can function as a `three pinned plug', in which internalization activity is not critically dependent on any one of the three interacting side chains.

Many (possibly all) transmembrane proteins in eukaryotic cells contain sorting determinants that specify their transport pathways and steady state distribution within the cell. Rapid internalization of a wide variety of plasma membrane proteins can be mediated by several different cytoplasmic sorting determinants (1), including two types of tyrosinebased motifs: NPxY and the YxxF motifs (F=bulky hydrophobic side chain) (2). Dileucine motifs form a distinct class of sorting signal, which, like YxxF motifs, can function both

Residues in bold are numbered according to their positions in the human sequence. The entire sequence is highly conserved, and residues Ser772 through to Ala784 (underlined) are invariant, in human (34), porcine (35), bovine (36), murine (37), rat (38), canine and ovine sequences. The canine sequence has the GenBankTM accession number M88170 (Manning AM, Sanders WE Jr, Kukielka GL, Dore M, Rosenbloom CL, Hawkins HL, Michael LH, Entman ML, Smith CW, Beaudet AL, Anderson DC.

P-selectin (C2 peptide, Figure 1) was determined at a resolu, tion of 3 A. The C2 peptide interacted with the 160­ 435m2 (i.e., there was electron density for the peptide) between residues Y - 4 (His773) to Y+ 3 (Phe780) (nomenclature as in Reference (13)), which encompasses the canonical

motif (Y777GVF780), alanine substitution of these and many other residues in the cytoplasmic domain either reduced the rate of internalization only moderately or increased the rate. It was concluded that P-selectin contains an unconventional sorting determinant, possibly dependent on higher-order structure. Similar conclusions were reached regarding the structure of the endosomal sorting determinant (23). In order to examine the interaction of the P-selectin cytoplasmic domain with adaptor subunits, we co-crystallized the signal binding domain of m2 adaptin (160­435m2) with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C2 region of the P-selectin cytoplasmic domain, which includes the YGVF sequence and drives internalization of P-selectin nearly as rapidly as the full length cytoplasmic domain (20). We found that the YGVF sequence in the peptide binds to 160­435m2 in a conformation identical to other YxxF motifs, but that a leucine residue in the Y-3 position binds to a separate hydrophobic pocket on the protein. This observation suggests that some functional sorting determinants are not readily identifiable by alanine scanning mutagenesis experiments in native proteins, because they interact with the sorting machinery over a larger surface area than typical YxxF motifs.

tyrosine based YxxF endocytic signal YGVF (Figure 2). This portion of the peptide assumes the same extended conformation as that adopted by hexapeptides corresponding to the YxxF endocytic motifs of other proteins (13; D. Owen. Unpublished data), forming an additional strand on the mixed b-sheet of the m2 protein via three hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). In addition, there is clear density for residues Y -4 to Y- 1 (HLGT) (Figure 2). This segment of the peptide adopts a type II b-turn, which is favored by the glycine at the Y -2 position and is stabilized by H-bonds between the Y -4 histidine backbone carbonyl and the amino group and side chain hydroxyl group of the Y-1 threonine. The peptide interacts with the protein via a H-bond between the backbone carbonyl group of the Y- 2 glycine with the side chain of Arg423 and the side chain of the leucine reside at Y-3 being inserted into a pocket on the protein's surface. This pocket is formed by the aliphatic portions of Gln318, Glu391, and with Pro393 and Ile425 (Figure 2B,C).

Contact between the peptide and m2 adaptin was evaluated by measuring the difference in solvent-accessible surface area of each residue of the peptide when bound to the protein versus when in solution (Table 1). Tyr777, the Y - 3 leucine, and the Y +3 phenylalanine all showed similar large changes in accessible surface area. Together, these three residues accounted for roughly three-quarters of the total binding surface. Previous mutagenesis studies have shown that alanine substitutions at Tyr777 and Phe780 in full length P-selectin have little effect on the internalization activity (20). In light of the structural data, analysis of alanine substitutions made in the context of P-selectin-DC1, which can only be internalized through the action of the C2 domain, were examined. In contrast to results in the full-length protein, in the context of P-selectin-DC1, Y777A and F780A were significantly impaired in internalization activity (Table 2), while most other alanine substitutions had similar or minor effects in both full-length and DC1 constructs.

Discussion
The interaction of YxxF endocytic motifs with m2 adaptin was described as being `a two pinned plug into a socket' (13) due to the Y and F residues (the pins) fitting into sterically and chemically complementary pockets on the protein's surface (24). Specificity of a YxxF motif/m2 interaction could come from the identity of the F residue and the interaction of the Y +2 residue with the protein. The latter interaction was demonstrated to be maximal when Y +2 is either an arginine or a proline (9,11) due to this residue being able to pack against Trp421 (13). Mutagenesis studies failed to identify any discrete internalization signal in full length P-selectin, and specifically showed that alanine substitution of Tyr777 reduced the rate of internalization only marginally (20) (Table 2). It was therefore surprising to find that the sequence Y777GVF780 of the P-selectin C2 cytoplasmic domain peptide associates with m2 adaptin in the same conformation found previously for the YxxF motifs in TGN38 and EGF receptor (13). The stable interactions observed between m2 adaptin and four residues in the C2 peptide amino-terminal to Tyr777 were also unexpected. This structure identifies a new site of endocytic motif side chain interaction in m2 adaptin, namely the pocket formed by Gln318, Glu391, Pro393, and Ile425, which, in this case, binds the leucine residue at Y -3 in the peptide (Figure 2B,C). This pocket could accommodate any bulky hydrophobic side chain. In this case, the area of contact between the leucine and the hydrophobic pocket is similar to the areas of contact between the tyrosine and the Y +3 phenylalanine and their respective binding pockets (Table 1), suggesting that all three residues may make similar contributions to the binding affinity. The presence of Glu391 could also favor the binding of a basic residue but not an acidic residue. The presence of another potential side chain binding site allows for increased scope of sequence specificity in proteins containing endocytic motifs. Further, this observation suggests that alanine scanning mutagenesis did not identify the sorting determinant in

Solvent-accessible surface area for each amino acid residue of the P-selectin peptide visible in the crystal structure was measured when bound to m2 adaptin and when in solution. The difference between the two measurements (Contact area) for , each residue is expressed in A2.

P-selectin because this sequence interacts as a `three pinned plug into a socket', and removing any one `pin' still leaves sufficient binding affinity to drive internalization in cells. The crystal structure presented here was obtained using a peptide corresponding to the 17-amino acid residue, COOHterminal C2 region of P-selectin, not the entire 35 amino acid residue-cytoplasmic domain (Figure 1). In cells, deletion of the C1 region (DC1) results in a small decrease in the rate of internalization, suggesting that the C2 region contains a functional internalization signal (20). Although it is unlikely that the C2 peptide itself can adopt conformations distinct from the full length cytoplasmic domain, the effects of alanine substitutions on the internalization activities in full length P-selectin versus P-selectin-DC1 suggest that these two proteins may interact with m2 adaptin somewhat differently when anchored in the lipid bilayer. The Y777A mutant in the context of full length P-selectin is internalized at approximately 70% of the rate of the native protein, and the F780A mutant is internalized faster than the native protein. However, the same mutations made in the context of P-selectin-DC1 significantly impair the internalization activity (Table 2). This suggests that the YGVF sequence may function as a `two pin' YxxF motif in the deletion mutant, perhaps because Leu774 cannot assume the correct conformation at the requisite distance from the bilayer to bind to m2 adaptin. Alternatively, an independent internalization activity in the C1 region, which drives internalization in the absence of the C2 domain at approximately half the rate of the full-length protein (20), may reduce or mask effects of mutations in the C2 domain. The structure described here shows that some sorting motifs may function as parts of larger structures, with less stringent sequence requirements. Even though the side chains of Leu774, Tyr777, and Phe780 interact with m2 adaptin, Tyr777 and Phe780 are not absolutely required for internalization activity (Table 2) in the native protein. Along these lines, it is also possible that the recently described sequences that function as internalization signals, but do not resemble known sorting motifs (5), may interact with the same sites used by the more familiar motifs, but not in an identical fashion. This possibility could be addressed by competition experiments, such as those demonstrating that different types of sorting motifs do not compete for the same binding sites (25,26). Alternatively, although we consider it unlikely, we cannot exclude that any particular mutant sequence may bind to sorting machinery in an entirely different fashion than the native sequence. The association between the P-selectin C2 peptide and m2 adaptin described here points to a significant limitation of alanine scanning mutagenesis experiments in defining sorting determinants. It was widely assumed, with some justification as it turns out, that single amino acid substitutions that abolish sorting activity identify residues that interact

directly with the sorting machinery. In the case of the TGN38 and EGF receptor YxxF motifs, both the tyrosine and the hydrophobic residue at Y + 3 are intolerant of alanine substitution (8,27) and bind directly to 160­ 435m2 (13). In the context of the DC1 deletion, the YGVF sequence in P-selectin also appears to function as a YxxF motif. However, the converse is not necessarily true. Here we present evidence that some non-conservative substitutions have little or no effect on sorting activity, even though the side chains in the native sequence make direct contact with the sorting machinery. Yeast two hybrid analysis of randomly generated YxxF motifs shows that some sequences with leucine in position Y- 3 can interact with adaptor medium chains. However, bulky hydrophobic residues in position Y - 3 are rare in functional YxxF motifs characterized to date (11). The existing mutagenesis experiments warn against extrapolating results to other rapidly internalized proteins based simply on primary structure, not least because residues not bound to m2 adaptin through their side chains do influence sorting activity. For example, changing the Y + 1 residue Gly778 in P-selectin to alanine results in a significant increase in the rate of endocytosis, both in full length P-selectin and the DC1 construct (Table 2). Glycine is unusual in the Y + 1 position (11) and severely impairs the activity of the YSKV internalization signal when introduced into the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (28). However, it is highly conserved in mammalian P-selectin sequences (see Figure 1), perhaps because larger side chains at this position would interfere with other sorting interactions mediated via the cytoplasmic domain (22). Also, in the context of P-selectin-DC1, the mutation T776A (Y -1) has an increased internalization rate, about 1.5 times faster than the native protein, or about 2 times faster than the DC1 mutant (Table 2), suggesting that a number of other residues could be tolerated in this position. In contrast, mutation of Asn782 (Y +5) to alanine decreases internalization activity to the greatest extent of any mutant analyzed in the full-length protein (20), even though the crystal structure suggests that this residue is not stably bound to m2 adaptin. The reason(s) for these changes in sorting activity, assuming that they represent changes in affinity for the same binding site, are not at all obvious from the structure. The results do suggest that local folding constraints, or possibly the loss or gain of constraints at some distance from the mutation, can have a significant effect on binding activity. Also, mutations in the Y+ 4 to Y +7 region in P-selectin may affect interactions with a different subunit of the AP-2 adaptor. A real understanding of these interactions, even at one binding site, may ultimately require detailed structural studies on a sufficiently large sample of sorting determinants.

Materials and Methods

VA). The peptide dissolved in 100 mM NaCl; 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) was added to a final protein-to-peptide ratio of 1:1, with the protein at a final concentration of 12 mg/ml. Crystals of the same space group and unit cell dimensions were grown as in (13). Data were recorded at 100 K at SRS Daresbury Station 9.6 on a ADSC Quantum4 CCD detector, integrated with MOSFLM (29), and , scaled using CCP4 programs (30) to give a final data set to 3 A resolution, which was 100% complete with an overall multiplicity of 9.2 with an Rmerge of 14.6% (I/sI of 2 in the outer bin). The model was built with O (31) and refined with REFMAC (32) to a final R factor of 22.7% (Rfree 27%). Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin were synthesized, expressed in CHO cells, and analyzed for internalization activity exactly as described previously (20). Single alanine substitutions of Leu774 to Asn782 were made in the deletion mutant DAsp763­ Ser772, which lacks 10 of the 11 residues encoded in the C1 exon, and is referred to here as DC1. The data are summarized in Table 2.
