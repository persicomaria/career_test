ABSTRACT

Oligonucleotides with a novel 2-O-[2-(guanidinium)ethyl] (2-O-GE) modification have been synthesized using a novel protecting group strategy for the guanidinium group. This modification enhances the binding affinity of oligonucleotides to RNA as well as duplex DNA (Tm 3.2 °C per modification). The 2-O-GE modified oligonucleotides exhibited exceptional resistance to nuclease degradation. The crystal structure of a palindromic duplex formed by a DNA oligonucleotide with a single 2-O-GE modification was solved at 1.16 Å resolution.

Oligonucleotides have been modified to make them useful for therapeutic and diagnostic applications,1,2 and 2-Omodified oligonucleotides are candidates for clinical applications.3 The 2-O-aminopropyl (2-O-AP, Figure 1) modification has extremely high nuclease resistance due to its cationic nature and good hybridization properties.4 The pKa of the primary amino group is around 9, and thus, the group is protonated under physiological conditions. Another interesting highly basic, cationic group is the guanidinium group (pKa ) 12.5). The guanidinium group contains three amines in a plane, remains protonated over a wide pH range,

Recently, we reported use of a novel amino protecting group compatible with oligonucleotide synthesis, the N-(2-(cyanoethoxycarbonyl) group (CEOC).7 Here, we report use of this protecting group in the synthesis of 2-O[2-(guanidinium)ethyl] (2-O-GE) modified oligonucleotides. The guanylating reagent was prepared by treatment of CEOEsuccinimide7 with carbamimidothioc acid methyl ester 1 to yield protected [[(2-cyanoethoxy)carbonyl]amino(methylthio)methylene] carbamic acid 2-cyanoethyl ester 2 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 2 shows the synthesis of the CEOC-protected 2O-GE-5-methyluridine-3-phosphoramidte 5 and solid support 6. The 2-O-[2-(amino)ethyl]-5-O-(4,4-dimethoxytrityl)5-methyluridine 3 was synthesized using previously reported procedures.7 Compound 3 was treated with guanylating reagent 2 and triethylamine in DMF at room temperature to yield 4 (66%) with a protected guanidinium functionality. Compound 4 was converted into 3-amidite 5 using standard procdures.7 Compound 4 was converted into the 3-Osuccinyl derivative and loaded onto amino alkyl controlled pore glass (CPG) according to previously published procedures8 to yield solid support 6 (32.8 µmol/g). Oligonucleotides shown in Table 1 were synthesized using phosphoramidite 5 and solid support 6, and the standard phosphoramidites and solid supports for incorporation of A, T, G, and C residues. Oxidation of the internucleosidic phosphite groups was carried out using 1-S-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)oxaziridine9 or tert-butylhydroperoxide/acetonitrile/water (10:87:3). The solid supports bearing the oligonucleotides were treated with 50% piperidine10 in water and kept at room temperature for 24 h to remove the CEOC protecting groups from the guanidinium groups and inter(6) (a) Dodda, D.

nucleoside phosphates and simultaneously release the oligonucleotides from solid supports. The solid supports were removed by filtration and the filtrates were concentrated to dryness. The oligonucleotides were then heated with aqueous ammonia (28-30 wt %) at 55 °C for 6 h to complete deprotection of the exocyclic amino protecting groups. Removal of the 2-cyanoethoxy groups from modified oligonucleotides with 50% piperidine in water prior to aqueous ammonia treatment was required to prevent formation of triazine derivative. The oligonucleotides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by ES-MS, HPLC, and capillary gel electrophoresis.

Hybridization of the modified oligonucleotides 8 and 10 (Table 1) to complementary RNA and DNA was evaluated (Table 2). In oligonucleotide 8, modifications were dispersed throughout the sequence, and we observed a duplex stabilization of 2 °C per modification as compared to the DNA analogue (7, Table 2). However, when the modifications were consecutive, as in sequence 10, the duplex with RNA was

control 11 but was considerably less than that of oligonucleotide 12 with consecutive modifications. This is in contrast to the positional effect on duplex stability where the oligonucleotide with consecutive modifications formed a less stable duplex with complementary RNA than that with dispersed modifications. Like the previously observed enhanced affinity of oligonucleotides with 2-amino ethyl groups for duplex DNA12 (Table 3), the stable triplexes formed by 2-O-GE oligonucleotides are presumably due to interaction of positively charged amino group and the negatively charged phosphate backbone.

slightly destabilized relative to the control oligonucleotide 9 (Table 2). These observations are in agreement with reported hybridization behavior of oligonucleotides bearing 2-O-aminopropyl or homologous groups.4 Hybridization with the complementary DNA led to duplexes less stable than those formed with the complementary RNA (Table 2). The sequence-specific recognition of duplex DNA by pyrimidine oligonucleotides involves the formation of triple helical structures stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds between the base on the DNA target and the pyrimidine third strand.11 Affinity of 2-O-GE-modified oligonucleotides for a double-stranded DNA target was evaluated (Table 3, Figure

Thermal denaturation results in two UV transitions. The first transition (T triplex) corresponds to the dissociation of the numbered strand and the second to melting of the DNA duplex (Tm duplex).

The observed enhancement in Tm was 0.6 °C per modification higher than observed with the 2-O-aminoethyl-modified oligonucleotide 15 (Table 3).12 When the modifications were dispersed as in oligonucleotides 13 and 14, the Tm enhancement was increased relative to

The crystal structure of palindromic 2-O-GE-modified oligonucleotide 16 was determined at 1.16 Å resolution and refined to an R factor of 13.2% (R-free ) 17.4%). The decamer duplex adopted a standard A-type geometry and all sugars, including the ribose moieties of 2-O-GE modified residues, exhibited C3-endo pucker. Torsion angles O2CA-CB-NC (atoms of 2-O-substituents are denoted CA, CB, NC, CD, NE, and NF) for both T*6 and T*16 displayed synclinal conformations (-63° and -55°, respectively), consistent with a gauche effect between O2 and NC (Figure 3). However, the CA-CB-NC-CD torsion angles differed considerably for T*6 and T*16 (87° and -90°, respectively). As a result, the guanidinium moiety of T*6 was near the phosphate group of the 3-adjacent residue A7 (the distances between terminal 2-O-GE nitrogens and bridging and nonbridging phosphate oxygens were between 3.41 Å, to O3, and 4.90 Å, to O5). For T*16, these distances are considerably longer (4.88 Å to O5, and 5.30 Å to O1P). Notably, only one of the terminal 2-O-GE nitrogens of T*16 was directed toward the phosphate group of A17, while the other forms a hydrogen bond to O4 of the same residue (3.58 Å).

Atoms are colored yellow, red, cyan, and orange for carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus, respectively, and T* carbons are highlighted in gold.

cations relative to oligonucleotides with dispersed 2-O-GE modified residues may be due to repulsions between positively charged guanidinium moieties in the minor groove. Although substituents and phosphate groups from 3-adjacent residues in the crystal structure of 16 are relatively closely spaced, the resulting partial neutralization appears to be insufficient to prevent repulsive interactions between neighboring 2-O-GE substituents. The stability of 2-O-GE oligonucleotides against nucleases was evaluated. The oligonucleotide phosphodiesters 17-19 with 2-O-GE modified residues at the 3-ends were synthesized and digested with snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVPD, Figure 3).13 Oligonucleotide 19 with four modified residues exhibited the highest exonuclease stability and oligonucleotide 17 with one residue was least resistant to exonuclease digestion (Figure 4).

In conclusion, we have synthesized novel 2-O-GE modified oligonucleotides that showed high affinity to RNA and double-stranded DNA and exceptional exonuclease stability. A novel guanylating reagent and a CEOC protecting group compatible with solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis were used. When dispersed in the sequence, the 2-O-GE modified oligonucleotides enhanced the Tm with a complementary RNA by 2 °C per modification compared to an unmodified oligonucleotide. This cationic modification also significantly enhanced the affinity of the oligonucleotides for triplex formation (Tm 3.2 °C per modification). These properties make the 2-O-GE modification useful for antisense and antigene strategy-based therapeutics and also as tools in molecular biology. The crystal structure of 2-O-GE modified DNA duplex gives insight into the stabilization observed with 2-O-GE modification.14
