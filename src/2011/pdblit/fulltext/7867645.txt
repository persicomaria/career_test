Interleukin-I (IL-1) molecules are cytokines involved in the acute-phase response against infection and injury. Three naturally occurring IL-1 molecules are known, two agonists: IL-la and IL-1P, and one antagonist, the 1L-1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra). Although IL-1 action protects the organism by enhancing the response to pathogens, its overproduction can lead to pathology and has been implicated in disease states that include septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, graft versus host disease and certain leukemias. The crystal structure of IL-lra has been solved at 0.21-nm resolution by molecular replacement using the ILlp structure as a search model. The crystals contain two independent IL-lra molecules which are very similar, IL-lra has the same fold as IL-la and IL-ID. The fold consists of twelve P-strands which form a six-stranded P-barrel, closed on one side by three P-hairpin loops. Cys69 and Cysll6 are linked via a disulfide bond and Pro53 has been built in the cis-conformation. Comparison of the IL-lra structure with the IL-la and IL-1P structures present in the Protein Data Bank shows that a putative receptor interaction region, involving the N-terminus up to the beginning of strand pl and the loops D and G, is very different in the three IL-1 molecules. Other putative interaction regions, as identified with mutagenesis studies, are structurally conserved and rigid, allowing precise and specific interactions with the IL-1 receptor.

Cytokines are proteins that act as powerful regulatory factors between cells. They are produced by many mammalian cells and exert their influence via binding to surface receptors (Henderson and Blake, 1992). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a cytokine that is involved in the acute-phase response to infection and injury (see Henderson and Blake, 1992; Dinarello, 1991 ; and Baumann and Gauldy, 1994, for reviews). The production of IL-1 is extremely sensitive to endotoxins (bacterial lipopolysaccharides). Human blood monocytes start synthesizing IL-1 after stimulation by as little as 10-20 p g h l of endotoxin. IL-1 produces a wide variety of biological and physiological responses. Intravenous infusion of low doses (I -10 ng/kg) of interleukin-IP (IL-1p) causes an increase in the number of circulating neutrophils and platelets (Tewari et al., 1990), while at higher doses it causes fever, sleepiness, hypotension and many other effects (Dinarello and Thompson, 1991). IL-I is able to activate T-cells in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of antigens or mitogens. At least four different cytokine molecules participate in eliciting the acute-phase response. These are the two IL-1 molecules which have been characterized: interleukin-la (IL-la) and ILI@ (both 17.5 kDa), tumor necrosis factor a (17 kDa) and IL6 (26 kDa). Two types of IL-1 receptor molecules have been

characterized. The type I receptor is a 80-kDa transmembrane protein with a proven signaling function (Stylianou et al., 1992). The type I1 receptor is a 68-kDa protein with only a short cytoplasmic tail. Evidence has been presented that the type I1 receptor inhibits IL-1 activity by acting as a decoy target (Colotta et al., 1993). Additional control of the IL-1 activity is provided by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra), a protein which binds to the IL-1 receptors, but which does not evoke any biological response (Hannum et al., 1990; Carter et al., 1990). The importance of the action of IL-1 is emphasized by the involvement of multiple cytokine molecules with overlapping functions while the need for tight control of this action is evidenced by the presence of multiple regulatory pathways. Although IL-1 action protects the organism by enhancing the response to pathogens, its overproduction can lead to pathological symptoms. IL-1 is a key mediator of inflammation and has been implicated in disease states that include septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, graft versus host disease and certain leukemias. Preliminary studies have indicated that inhibition of the action of IL-1, either by using the IL-lra protein to block the IL-I receptors, or by using soluble IL-1 receptors to bind excess IL1, could have therapeutic benefits (Henderson and Blake, 1992; Dinarello and Thompson, 1991; Ohlsson et al.,1990). Recombinant IL-Ira is currently being tested in clinical trials for treating septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic myelogenous leukemias (Dinarello and Thompson, 1991 ; Bone, 1991). Studies in mice have shown that administration of soluble IL-1 receptor could arrest the progress of experimental arthritis (Schorlemmer

et al., 1993) and that it had a profound inhibitory effect in the development of in vivo alloreactivity (Fanslow et al., 1990). It is clear that compounds which are able to inhibit the action of IL-1 could have a significant potential as drugs. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of the two IL-1 molecules and of the IL-lra molecule could assist the design of such inhibitors. The crystal structure of IL-la has been solved (Graves et al., 1990) and the structure of IL-1p has been solved by at least five different groups by X-ray crystallography (Priestle et al., 1988; Finzel et al., 1989; van Oostrum et al., 1991; Veerapandian et al., 1992; Oldfield et al., 1993; Ohlendorf et al., Protein Data Bank entries 511B and 8IlB) and by one group with NMR (Clore et al., 1991). In addition, the crystal structure of an IL18 mutant has been published (Camacho et al., 1993). In this paper, we present the crystal structure of the IL-lra protein, refined at 0.21-nm resolution. The protein contains a disulfide link between Cys69 and Cysll6 and Pro53 has been fitted in the cisconformation. Two other groups have recently reported a similar crystal structure (Clancy et al., 1994; Vigers et al., 1994) but they did not report the presence of a disulfide link and a cisproline.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Expression and purification. The IL-lra gene was purchased from British Biotechnology Labs (BBL). For expression purposes, the gene was inserted into the TAC-Bsp vector (a modification of the TAC-RBS vector described by Zurawski et al., 1986). The construct was made by cutting the BBL IL-lra vector with Hind111 and BamHI and isolating the HindIII-BamHI fragment. This was then inserted into a BspMUBamHI-digested TAC-Bsp vector with the addition of two linker oligonucleotides to bridge the restriction site and to put the gene in frame. Recombinant IL-lra protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as follows. Recombinant E. coli was grown in a 6-1 fermenter overnight at 37°C in Luria broth containing 50 pg/ml ampicillin. Bacterial cells were harvested, washed with Tris/ EDTA (25 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA) and stored at -80°C until use. Frozen cells were resuspended in 100 ml 25 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA and 1 pg/ml leupeptin (Calbiochem), and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 1.5 M was added to the supernatant that was then incubated overnight at 4°C. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation and loaded on a Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) column (80 ml), pre-equilibrated with TrisEDTA containing 1.5 M ammonium sulfate. The column was eluted with a 180-ml linear gradient of 1.50 M ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing IL-Ira (detected by SDSPAGE analysis) were pooled, dialyzed against Tris/ EDTA, and passed on a MonoQ column using the FPLC system (Pharmacia), with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in Tris/ EDTA. Ammonium sulfate up to 1.5 M was added to the IL-lra fraction and the solution was passed once again through the Phenyl-Sepharose column, using a step elution with TrisEDTA containing no NaCl to concentrate and desalt. The protein was finally purified to homogeneity (by SDSPAGE criteria) by gel filtration on a 150-ml Sephacryl-200 (Pharmacia) column. About 50 nig pure protein was obtained from a 6-1 fermentation. The recombinant protein has two differences with natural human IL-lra: (a) it contains an extra Met at the N-terminus and (b) it is non-glycosylated. However, biological experiments have established that recombinant IL-lra has identical behavior to the natural product (Eisenberg et al., 1990; Ann Akeson, unpublished results). Crystallization. Recombinant IL-lra was crystallized using the hanging-drop method under the following conditions. A pro-

tein solution was prepared by mixing a solution of 20 mg/ml ILlra, 30 mM NaCl and 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.3 with an equal volume of a solution of 5 % (mass/vol.) poly(ethy1ene glycol) 8000, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 and 100 mM ammonium acetate. Drops ( 5 pl) of the protein solution were set to equilibrate at 4°C against 1 ml of a solution of 30% (masshol.) poly(ethylene glycol) 8000. Lozenge-shaped crystals with dimensions of up to 0.2X0.6X0.8 mm3 appeared after one or two months. The crystals diffract to about 0.20-nm resolution. The space group is P4,2,2 with a = b = 7.13 nm and c = 11.73 nm. The asymmetric unit contains two IL-lra molecules. The specific volume V,,,= 0.00229 nm3/Da and the solvent content calculated from this number (Matthews, 1968) is 46%. The space group is identical to the space group reported by Clancy et al. (1994) and Vigers et al. (1994) for their IL-lra crystals and also the cell dimensions are quite similar. Data collection. X-ray data were collected using a multiwire area detector (Siemens). The crystals were cooled to 4 "C during data collection, the temperature at which they were grown. The crystal-detector distance was 160 mm and the exposure time was 120 s/frame of 0.25". Nine scans at 2 8 = 30", 2 8 = 25" and 2 8 = 10" were performed. Data were processed using the XENGEN package (Howard et al., 1987). A total of 199878 reflections were measured, which yielded 16 972 unique reflections, representing 92.7 % of all possible reflections to 0.21 nm. The highest resolution shell (0.22-0.21 nm) is 60.1 % complete and has an average I / q of 2.0. In addition, we collected data on 13 crystals which had been soaked or crystallized in the presence of heavy atom reagents. However, these data sets were not used to solve the phase problem and will not be discussed here. The heavy atom positions obtained from a mercury cyanide derivative confirmed the results of the molecular replacement procedure. Molecular replacement. IL-lra has the same number of amino acids as IL-1p and has 23 % sequence identity. IL-lra also binds to the same receptors as IL-lp, although IL-Ira binding does not elicit a response. Also the NMR results by Stockman et al. (1992) indicated that both proteins have a similar fold. We attempted, therefore, to solve the IL-1ra structure with search models based on the structure of IL-lP (Priestle et al., 1989). However, using the programs Merlot (Fitzgerald, 1988) and Xplor (Briinger, 1990), we did not find any clear solution, either with the complete IL-1p model, or with truncated or backbone models of IL-1p. Also, IL-lra models obtained by homology building and models obtained by including published NMR restraints (Stockman et al., 1992) failed to produce a clear solution. This lack of results fits well with the experience of Clancy et al. (1994) who solved the IL-lra structure with heavy atoms because their attempts to use molecular replacement were unsuccessful, and the experience of Vigers et al. (19941, who could only solve the molecular replacement problem for IL-lra in a triclinic space group and not in the tetragonal space group used by us and by Clancy et al. (1994). However, by using an automated procedure, as implemented in the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994), using the IL-1p structure as determined by Finzel et al. (1989) and by placing two molecules, we obtained a solution for data between 0.800.35-nm resolution with a correlation coefficient of 29.6%. The next best solution had a correlation of 23.4%. The molecular replacement procedure was repeated for the two enantiomorphic space groups P4,2,2 and P4,2,2, but a solution was only obtained in space group P4,2,2, thus establishing the latter as the correct space group. The position of the two search models is in agreement with solvent boundaries as observed in the preliminary electron density map based on two heavy atom derivatives (data not shown)

and on the heavy atom positions we had found. When compared with the final model, the four mercury positions of a mercury(I1) cyanide derivative are at 0.10-0.25-nm from cysteine S y atoms. The first mercury position is at 0.1 2 nm of the S y of Cys122I (I denotes the first independent IL-lra molecule, I1 the second). The second mercury is at 0.25 nm of the S y of Cysl22II. The third mercury is at 0.14 nm of the S y of Cys69I and at 0.10 nm of the S y of Cysll61, which form a disulfide link in the native structure. Finally, the fourth heavy atom position is at 0.17 nm of the S y of Cys69II and at 0.16 nm of the Sy of Cysll6II. Two mercury ions appear to have inserted into disulfide links which is somewhat unusual because normally disulfide links need to be reduced first before they react with mercury. The different batch of protein used for the preparation of the heavy atoms might have lacked the disulfide link or, alternatively, the geometry or surroundings of the disulfide link might have promoted insertion of the mercury ions. Refinement. All side chains of the two oriented and positioned IL-lP molecules were changed into alanine molecules and the structure was refined using X-plor (Briinger, 1992). Energy minimization using data between 0.80-0.30 nm lowered the Rfactor from 0.546 to 0.418. Subsequent molecular dynamics refinement at the same resolution, using a slow cooling protocol going from 3000 K to 300 K followed by refinement of individual, isotropic temperature factors, yielded an R-factor of 0.336. The electron density map based on this model allowed about 50% of the side chains to be placed. Subsequent molecular dynamics and individual, isotropic temperature factor refinement yielded an R-factor of 0.284 for data between 0.80-0.30 nm. Sixteen rounds of map inspection, rebuilding and refinement with gradually increasing resolution were performed. Water molecules were assigned by searching F,- F, maps for peaks of at least 40 which are between 0.22-0.45 nm of protein atoms or other water molecules. During refinement, we discovered that the diffraction of our IL-1ra crystal was strongly anisotropic. Refinement of overall anisotropic B-factors yielded a value of 0.065 nmz for B11 and B22, and of -0.132 nmz for B33. The final model was obtained after removal of all water molecules with temperature factors higher than 0.70 nmz followed by two more rounds of map inspection, energy minimization and refinement of individual, isotropic temperature factors. The final model contains 139 water molecules (about 7ODL-lra molecule). The final R-factor I S 0.199 for all 16599 observed reflections between 0.80-0.21 nm and 0.186 for 14556 reflections greater

than 20. Using data from infinity to 0.21-nm resolution, we obtain an R-factor of 0.275 for all 16962 reflections and an Rfactor of 0.264 for 14914 reflections greater than 2a. These latter two R-factors are high because we did not apply any correction for the scattering of bulk solvent and the low resolution data were not included in the refinement. Superpositions. The crystal structures of IL-la (Graves et al., 1990; Protein Data Bank code 2ILA) and &I/? (Finzel et al., 1989; Protein Data Bank code 1IIB) were superimposed onto the IL-lra structure as follows. In a first step, the Ca backbones of IL-la and IL-1p were manually superimposed onto the backbone of IL-lra. This manual superposition was used to define structurally equivalent regions. The superposition of these regions was subsequently optimized using the algorithm of Kabsch (1976). Residue pairs deviating more than three standard deviations were excluded from the superposition. The structurally equivalent regions were reassessed using the optimized superposition and the procedure was repeated until convergence was reached. The final parameters are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

RESULTS Overall structure. The asymmetric unit of our crystals contains two independent IL-lra molecules. The final model contains residues 8-152 of the first molecule and residues 9-152 of the second molecule. In addition, 139 water molecules have been added to the structure. The mean coordinate error as estimated from a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) is 0.02-0.03 nm. The structure has excellent geometry with root-mean-square (rms) deviations of 0.0008 nm for bond lengths and 1.5" for bond angles. All non-glycine residues have p , angles within or close to al~ lowed regions (see Fig. l). A disulfide link is present between Cys69 and Cysll6 (see Fig. 2A). Pro53 has been modeled in the cis-conformation. It is part of a flexible loop and its electron density is not very well defined. However, attempts to refine Pro53 in the trans-conformation led to unallowed p,ty angles and F,-F, difference maps showed peaks which clearly indicated that a cis-proline should be fitted. The fit of Pro53 in a 2F,-F, omit map is indicated in Fig. 2B. The IL-Ira molecule has twelve p-strands, two very short 3,, helices and no a-helices (see Tables 3 and 4). Following Griitter et al. (1994), we numbered the ,!-strands 1-12 and named the connecting loops A-K (see Figs 3 and 6). The twelve /?-strands form a six-stranded /?-barrel (made by strands 1, 4, 5 , 8, 9 and 12) which on one side is closed by three ,!-hairpin loops (made by strands 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 and 11). A schematic drawing of the IL-Ira molecule is presented in Fig. 3. A pseudo-three-old axis

Pro53 in both molecules is in the cisconformation. Vigers et al. (1994) report that Am27 and Asp52 (the latter should be Glu52 according to the published sequences) are outliers d in the q v plot. Am27 in our model has p/v angles of 54",57" (molecule I) and 59",38" (molecule 11) which are in the region of a left-handed ahelix. The fit to the electron density map is reasonable but Am27 is part of the flexible loop B which may have led to a different interpretation by Vigers et al. (1 994). Our early models with Pro53 in the truns-confor~ mation led to deviating q,v angles for GIu52. The deviating 9 ,angles of Asp(?)52 reported by Vigers et al. (1994) suggest that they have modeled Pro53 in the trans-conformation,

coincides with the barrel axis, relating three similar folding motifs consisting of a barrel strand, a p-hairpin loop followed by a second barrel strand. The two loops which connect the first three P-strands of the folding motif (loops A, B, E, F, I and J) are short (2-7 residues), while the third loop in each motif (loops C, G and K) is long (11 -17 residues). The long loops C, G and K connect the hairpin loop with the second barrel strand (strands 4, 8 and 13) in the folding motif, and, as will be discussed below, these long loops vary with respect to IL-la and IL-1p. The topology of the IL-Ira molecule with its 12 antiparallel P-strands is identical to that of Kunitz-type soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sweet et al., 1974) and many other proteins including IL-la (Graves et al., 1990), IL-1p (Priestle et al., 1988, 1989; Finzel et al., 1989; van Oostrum et al., 1991; Veerapandian et al., 1992; Oldfield et al., 1993; Ohlendorf et al., Protein Data Bank entries 5I1B and 8I1B ; Clore et al., 1991), acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (Eriksson et al., 1991, 1993; Zhang et al., 1991; Zhu et al., 1991), the ricin toxin B chain (Rutenber and Robertus, 1991), Erythrina caffra trypsin inhibitor (Onesti et al., 1991), hisactophilin (Habazetti et al., 1992), and Wa amylase inhibitor (Zemke et al., 1991). This fold has been named Kunitz fold or interleukin-1 fold and has been described in great detail by Murzin et al. (1992) and by Swindels and Thornton (1993). A superposition of the two independent IL-lra molecules which are present in the crystals is shown in Fig. 4. The two molecules are virtually identical (0.02 nm rms difference for 101 equivalent Ca atoms). The only significant difference is a rigid body rotation of loop F between strands p6 and p7 which hinges around Lys71 and Thr76. Gly73, furthest away from the pivot

Fig. 5. Temperature factor distribution of the two independent ILIra molecules. The temperature factors of molecule I are drawn in continuous lines, of molecule I1 in broken lines. Bars indicate the 12 /3strands which make up the core of the IL-lra molecule and capitals

indicate the connecting loops. Most parts of the two molecules have very similar temperature factors, the exceptions are loops C , D and G. sent in these regions for the main chain, but a number of side chains, especially those of Glu52, His54 and Glu139 have weak or absent electron density, suggesting that these side chains are freely moving in the solvent. The presence of two independent molecules in our crystals allows us to use the structure as an example to study the influence of the crystal packing on the distribution of temperature factors. Most parts of the two independent molecules have very similar temperature factors, but loops C, D and G differ considerably. As will be discussed below, most of these differences can be explained by stabilization of flexible surface loops by crystal contacts. The two independent IL-lra molecules have been arbitrarily named molecule I and molecule I1 and are thus indicated. For loop C, a crystal contact (d 5 0.35 nm) is present between Asn41I and Asn3911, both belonging to loop C. The loop C residues Gly37I and Pro381 have additional crystal contacts with Glyl4011, which is part of the mobile loop K. Loop C residue Asn41II has an additional crystal contact with His611, which is part of strand p5 and has low mobility. The crystal contact of loop C of molecule I1 with the rigid His611 apparently has led to its much lower temperature factors. For loop D, we find crystal contacts of Pro531 with As112811 and Met65II. No crystal contacts were found for loop D in molecule 11, consistent with the 'much higher temperature factors of this loop in molecule 11. For loop G, Asn91, Arg92 and Lys93 are involved in crystal contacts in both molecules. However, if we count the number of crystal contacts up to 0.45 nm, we find 125 such contacts in molecule I and only 41 in molecule 11, which could explain the much lower temperature factors of loop K in molecule I.

similar, relatively high, overall temperature factor has been reported for IL-1p (Priestle et al., 1989). For IL-lra, this high overall temperature factor seems to be caused by some extremely flexible loops. A plot of the distribution of temperature factors (Fig. 5 ) shows that the 12 /%strands which form the core of the IL-lra molecule have temperature factors between 0.20.3 nmz, while some of the interconnecting loops have temperature factors up to I .0 nm2. Continuous electron density is pre-

Comparison with IL-la and IL-lP. The structures of IL-la (only Ca coordinates) and IL-1p are available in the Protein Data Bank and allow for a comparison of the two IL-1 agonists (ILl a and IL-IB with the IL-1 antagonist (IL-Ira) structure solved by us. The IL-la and IL-1p structures were superimposed onto the IL-lra molecule I structure and the matching residues were optimized (see Tables 1 and 2). The sequence alignment, based on the three crystal structures is given in Fig. 6. Between the superimposed IL-la and IL-Ira, 63 Ca atoms (41 %) have positional differences of less than 0.10 nm and between the superimposed structures of IL-lp and IL-lra, 86 Ca atoms (56%) differ less than 0.10 nm. These observations suggest that the IL-lra

Fig.6. Structural alignment of IL-la, IL-lra and IL-la. Not indicated is the N-terminal Met, which is present in our recombinant IL-Ira but not
in the natural protein. Lower-case letters indicate residues which are absent from the crystal structures because of disorder. Vertical bars indicate residues where the C a atoms of the superimposed structures differ less than 0.10 nm. The names of B-strands and connecting loops are indicated above the sequences. Six variable regions are boxed. For IL-la, we used the sequence numbering as is used in the Protein Data Bank entry (code 2LA). This alignment is identical to the one published by Vigers et al. (1994) for the conserved regions and differs somewhat for the non-conserved, regions. The alignment in the latter regions is, however, rather arbitrary.

Fig. 7. Superposition of IL-la, IL-lP and IL-lra. The Ca backbones
are shown in the region around the N-terminus, the region where the three molecules differ most. IL-la is indicated in thin, black lines, IL1/3 is indicated in gray lines and IL-lra is indicated in thick, black lines. Residue numbers belonging to the IL-la structure have the suffix a; residues numbers belonging to the IL-lP structure have the suffix /3. Residues 59-63 of IL-la are not present in the coordinate file, presumably because they are disordered. The side chains of residues of IL-IP which, according to mutagenesis studies (see Table 5) are important for receptor interaction, are also indicated. The position of the N-terminal region with respect to the complete molecule can be found in Fig. 9.

Fig.8. Ca backbone of IL-lra with the side chains of 15 residues which are conserved between IL-lra, IL-la and IL-lP. These residues
are: Aspl7, Leu30, Ala32, Leu35, Leu58, Leu80, Phe100, Phelll, Serll3, Proll7, Thr123, Va1131, Leu133, Thr144, and Phe146 (numbers refer to the IL-Ira sequence).

molecule is more similar to IL-lp than to IL-la, a conclusion which is not unexpected because the sequence identity of 26% between IL-lra and IL-lp is much higher than the sequence identity of 18% between IL-lra and IL-la (Eisenberg et al., 1991). The largest differences between the three molecules are concentrated in an area at the side of the p-barrel that involves the N-termini and loops D and G (see Fig. 7). The N-terminus of the IL-la molecule is much longer than the N-terminus of ILlp. The N-terminus of IL-la contains 14 residues more than IL1p in the sequence and 8 residues more in the crystal structures. The first 8 residues of IL-la and the first 2 residues of IL-1p are not present in the structures, presumably because they are disordered. In IL-la, the N-terminal residues 6-10 (named strand N; Graves et al., 1990), part of loop D (residues 55-58), and loop

G (residues 97-99; strand BL according to Graves et al.) form an anti-parallel P-sheet-like structure with the N-terminal strand in the center. In the absence of full coordinates, it is not possible to determine whether these strands form a true /I-sheet. Part of loop D (residues 59-61) is missing in the IL-la structure and appears to be disordered. The p-sheet-like structure is not present in the IL-1p and IL-lra structures. In IL-lp, Asn48 of loop D is directly hydrogen bonded to Lys93 of loop G. No direct contacts between loop D and loop G are present in the IL-lra structure. Loop D in IL-lra is six residues shorter than in IL-la and IL-lp. The N-terminus of IL-lra, which is disordered in the crystal structure, could theoretically insert between loop D and loop G, like it does in IL-la. In the structural alignment presented in Fig. 6, we find 15 residues, including 5 leucines, which are invariant in the human IL-la, IL-1p and IL-lra structures. These residues are shown in Fig. 8. Examination of an alignment of seven IL-1 sequences (Oldfield et al., 1993) reveals that, with two exceptions, these residues are completely conserved. As will be discussed below, these residues, with the exception of Thr144, seem to be important for the folding of the IL-1 molecule.

Schreuder et al. (EUKJ. Biochem. 227)

The first conserved residue, Asp17 (the IL-lra sequence numbering is used throughout) is completely buried. It is situated at the end of strand p1, just before a p-turn. Its 061 atom is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the main-chain amide protons of Asnl9, Gln20 and Lys21, in and just after the turn. Their three main-chain amide protons all point towards the Asp1 7 061, a situation reminiscent of the oxy-anion hole in serine proteinases. The 062 of Asp17 is hydrogen-bonded to the conserved Thr123. Any mutation of Asp17 is likely to disrupt the structurally conserved loop A between strand pl and p2. The side chains of the conserved residues Leu30, Leu80 and Val131 are packed next to each other in the core of the IL-1 molecules. Ala32, which is not 100% conserved (it is Thr in murine IL-la), is situated next to Val131 and Thrl23. The latter residue, as we have seen, is hydrogen-bonded to the conserved Aspl7. The conserved residue Leu35 is not part of the core of the IL-Ira molecule, but is at the center of the relatively exposed loop C between strands p3 and p4 (see Fig. 8). In contrast, the conserved residues Leu58, Phe100, P h e l l l and Phe146 are all clustered in the hydrophobic core. The side chain of the conserved Serll3 is buried and makes a hydrogen bond with the main-chain amide proton of Cysll6, stabilizing the loop I between strands @ and pl0. This loop also contains the conserved , Proll7, which is exposed and which may be important for the conformation of the structurally conserved loop I. The invariant Leu133 is at the surface, next to the conserved residues PhelOO and Serll3 mentioned above. Leu133 is not completely conserved, being Met in bovine IL-la. Finally, Thr144 is the only conserved residue we found which is not buried and does not serve an obvious structural function. Interestingly, the adjacent residue Lys145 has been shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be crucial in determining agonist or antagonist activity. An aspartate at this position as in IL-la, IL-1p and in the Lysl45+Asp mutant of IL-lra leads to agonist activity, while a lysine at this position, as in 1L-Ira and the Aspl45-Lys mutation of IL-IB (Ju et al., 1991) leads to IL1 antagonist activity. It is therefore likely that Thr144 is conserved because it is important for receptor interaction.

region with trans-Pro53, while they are in the allowed region with cis-Pro53 (Fig. 1). In the absence of a structure of the IL-1 receptor or of a complex of the IL-1 receptor with one of its ligands, it is difficult to know exactly which residues are really important for receptor interaction. However, information on the crystal structures of the agonists IL-la and IL-lp, and the antagonist IL-lra can be combined with abundant data from mutagenesis experiments, mostly on IL-Ip (Table 5) and some data on IL-la (Yanofsky and Zurawski, 1990; Kawashima et al., 1992; Gayle et al., 1993; Labriola-Tompkins et al., 1993). Mutations in IL-lp causing at least a fourfold change in receptor binding or biological activity are listed in Table 5 and their position in the molecule is indicated in Fig. 9. Mutations strongly affecting the receptor interaction cover a large part of the surface of the IL-lp molecule and involve a region around the N-terminus, the open end of the P-barrel and loops C and J (indicated by 'third region' in Fig. 9). The N-terminal region involves the N-terminus up to the beginning of strand pl and loops D (which includes Pro53) and G. Amino acid substitutions in this region strongly affect both receptor binding and biological activity (Table 5). Electrostatic calculations (Oldfield et al., 1993) revealed that this region corresponds to an area of positive charge which appears to be important for receptor interaction. Indeed, replacement in IL-1p of DISCUSSION Lys92 and Lys93 by anything except Arg leads to a drop in Two other groups have very recently reported the crystal activity (see Table 5 ) , while some (not all) mutations that enstructure of the IL-lra, an initial analysis by Clancy et al. (1994) hance this positive charge (e.g. SerS-+Arg and Glu51-Arg; Laand a more detailed report by Vigers et al. (1994). However, briola-Tompkins et al., 1991 ; Simon et al., 1993), also enhance neither group mentions the presence of a disulfide link nor of a receptor binding. Surprisingly, this region, where some mutcis-proline. Vigers et al. claim in their Experimental Procedures ations lead to less than 1 % activity, is also the region with the that no disulfide link is present in the IL-lra. The disulfide link largest structural differences between IL-la, IL-1p and IL-lra is in our case well defined (Fig. 2A) and at a resolution of (see Fig. 7). In the crystals this region is flexible, its residues 0.21 nm (our data) and 0.20nm (Vigers et al., 1994) it is un- have high temperature factors and part of the N-termini in all likely that this difference is due to uncertainties in the interpreta- three molecules and part of loop D in IL-la are disordered, sugtion of the electron density maps. The presence/absence of the gesting that this region could adapt itself for optimal receptor disulfide link must therefore have been caused by different hand- interaction. It is likely that the disordered regions will become ling of the protein samples. The IL-lra has in both cases been ordered upon receptor binding. Nevertheless, the large structural produced in E. coli, which itself does not make disulfide links. and sequence differences in this area suggest that the receptor Our disulfide link may have formed spontaneously due to expo- interactions will be different for the three different IL-1 molesure to air.

is interrupted due to the presence of Lys at position 145, instead of the Asp present in the agonists IL-la and IL-1B and the authors argue that this positive charge may be important for antagonist action. The crystallographic study presented in this paper clearly establishes that the folding of the IL-lra molecule is very similar to the folding of the IL-la and L - l g molecules. One putative receptor interaction region, the N-terminal region, is quite variable and flexible. while other putative interaction regions are structurally conserved and more rigid, which would allow precise and specific interactions with the IL-1 receptor. Detailed structural information is now available for a natural receptor antagonist which can be used in interpretation of results from mutational studies and to aid the design of novel IL-1 agonist or antagonist molecules.
