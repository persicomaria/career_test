Summary p97, an abundant hexameric ATPase of the AAA family, is involved in homotypic membrane fusion. It is thought to disassemble SNARE complexes formed during the process of membrane fusion. Here, we report two structures: a crystal structure of the N-terminal and D1 ° ATPase domains of murine p97 at 2.9 A resolution, and a cryoelectron microscopy structure of full-length ° rat p97 at 18 A resolution. Together, these structures show that the D1 and D2 hexamers pack in a tail-totail arrangement, and that the N domain is flexible. A comparison with NSF D2 (ATP complex) reveals possible conformational changes induced by ATP hydrolysis. Given the D1 and D2 packing arrangement, we propose a ratchet mechanism for p97 during its ATP hydrolysis cycle. Introduction p97 and NSF belong to the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) family of proteins (Neuwald et al., 1999). p97/VAT/CDC48p are abundant homohexameric (97 kDa subunit) Mg2 -dependent ATPases that catalyze certain homotypic membrane fusion events. In budding yeast, the p97 homolog, Cdc48p, fuses ER membranes together utilizing the t-SNARE Ufe1p (Patel

et al., 1998). In mammals, p97, along with NSF and the Golgi t-SNARE syntaxin 5, mediates the fusion of Golgi membranes (Rabouille et al., 1995; Kondo et al., 1997). Although p97 and NSF are highly homologous, they appear to act in distinct fusion events, presumably due to additional specific cofactors; p97 requires the cofactor p47 for interactions with syntaxin 5 (Kondo et al., 1997; Rabouille et al., 1998), whereas NSF requires SNAPs for SNARE interactions and disassembly (Sollner et al., 1993a, 1993b). Homologs of p97 are found in archaea, which do not contain internal membranes, suggesting roles for p97 other than membrane fusion as well as indicating that p97 is the more ancient form of the two membrane fusion ATPases. p97/Cdc48p has also been implicated in proteasomal protein degradation since it binds to Ufd2p/ E4 and Ufd3p, which are components of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Ghislain et al., 1996; Koegl et al., 1999). Recently, p97 has been implicated in protein degradation by its interaction with UFD1, a component of the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway (Meyer et al., 2000). p97 is also a target of tyrosine phosphorylation during T cell activation, although the significance of this is not clear (Egerton et al., 1992). The AAA proteins are characterized by the presence of one or two conserved AAA domains (230­250 residues) that contain the Walker A and B motifs. Members of this family are involved in a myriad of cellular processes as diverse as membrane fusion (p97 and NSF), organelle biogenesis (PAS1p), motor proteins (TorsinA), DNA helicases (RuvB), proteolysis (Lon and Clp), and transcriptional regulation (SUG1 and TBP1; for reviews, see Patel and Latterich, 1998; Neuwald et al., 1999). The contrast between the functional diversity of AAA proteins and the fact that the AAA cassette is conserved from archaea to modern eukaryotes suggest that it plays a fundamental role in all life forms. One prevalent hypothesis for the mode of action of AAA proteins is that they perform nucleotide-dependent chaperone-like functions and aid in the assembly, disassembly, or functional operation of protein complexes (Confalonieri and Duguet, 1995; Morgan and Burgoyne, 1995; Leonhard et al., 1999; Neuwald et al., 1999). Very little is known, however, about how changes in nucleotide binding and/ or hydrolysis are coupled to AAA function, although the Walker A and B boxes are essential for ATPase activity. The role of the AAA minimal consensus is also not immediately obvious, although mutations in this region can abolish the enzymatic activity of FtsH, an ATP-dependent protease found in prokaryotic cells, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (Karata et al., 1999). p97 and NSF comprise two AAA domains (D1 and D2) and an 200 residue N-terminal substrate/adaptor molecule recognition domain (N). The D1 and D2 domains of p97 have high sequence identity (40%), suggesting that p97 may have evolved from gene duplication of a AAA domain. Subsequent evolutionary events may have led to the emergence of the p97 homolog NSF, to perform more specialized functions in membrane fusion pathways. From electron microscopy stud-

ies, both p97/VAT and NSF have structures comprised of two stacked hexameric rings (Peters et al., 1992; Hanson et al., 1997; Fleming et al., 1998; Rockel et al., 1999). Recent studies have provided some structural insights into the arrangement of membrane fusion AAA ATPases, with structure determinations of the NSF D2 hexamer and NSF/Sec18 and VAT N-terminal domains (Lenzen et al., 1998; Yu et al., 1998; Babor and Fass, 1999; Coles et al., 1999; May et al., 1999; Yu et al., 1999). However, the overall structural relationship between the N, D1, and D2 AAA domains is hitherto unknown, as are the molecular details that link ATP hydrolysis with target protein disassembly and membrane fusion. Results and Discussion Crystal Structure of p97 N D1 Recombinant p97 N D1 was purified and crystallized in a hexagonal space group with one monomer per asymmetric unit. Phases were obtained by a combination of MAD (multiple anomalous dispersion) and SIR (single isomorphous replacement), and the structure was refined using CNS (Table 1). The p97 N D1 monomer comprises four subdomains and bound ADP (Figure 1A). The N-terminal part consists of a double barrel superfold (Castillo et al., 1999; residues 25­106; Figure 1A, yellow), and a four-stranded barrel (residues 112­186; Figure 1A, gold), joined by a short linker (six residues; Figure 2A). A cleft is formed between the two subdomains. The p97 AAA D1 domain (residues 209­458) comprises a doubly wound / fold (Figure 1A, cyan) and a C-terminal -helical domain (Figure 1A, blue). The central / do-

main contains the Walker A (P loop; Figure 1A) and B (DExx box) motifs involved in nucleotide interactions, while the C-terminal -helical domain comprises a fourhelical bundle (Figure 1A). The interface between the N and D1 domains is largely confined to the area between the barrel of the N-terminal domain (Figures 1A and 1B, gold) and the D1 -helical domain (Figures 1A and 1B, blue). These interactions together comprise greater than 70% of the ° total interface surface area of 1520 A2. The extended helix-loop-helix structure (residues 436­443; 12 13) and the loop connecting 10 and 11 form intimate interactions with the large loop between 7 and 3, as well as the loop connecting 8 and 9 (see Figure 1B and supplemental figures at http://www.molecule.org/ cgi/content/full/6/6/1473/DC1). The N D1 interface accounts for 8% of the total solvent-accessible surface area of the N domain and 6% of the D1 domain. Nearly half of the residues involved in the N D1 interface are conserved between NSF and p97, while over 80% are conserved between p97 and its yeast homolog, Cdc48p (see supplemental figures at http://www.molecule.org/cgi/ content/full/6/6/1473/DC1). This suggests that the N D1 domain arrangement observed here could be representative of other p97 homologs, albeit in a particular nucleotide-bound state. The linker region (residues 186­208; Figures 1A and 1B, magenta) that connects the N and ° D1 domains is only partially buried (1500 A2 out of a ° total solvent-accessible area of 2900 A2). Previous data suggested a relative movement between the N and D1 domains upon ATP hydrolysis (Hanson et al., 1997). By comparing this linker region with the corresponding re-

gion in the NSF D2 structure (Lenzen et al., 1998; Yu et al., 1998), significant conformational differences are observed, indicating that the linker region could be flexible (Figure 2B; p97, magenta; NSF, gold). A struc-

ture-based sequence alignment reveals two highly conserved glycines at the N and C termini of the linker (Gly186 and Gly-208, respectively; Figure 2C, left box). It is plausible that these glycines act as pivot points, allowing

relative movements between N and D1 domains upon ATP hydrolysis similar to the relay helix region in myosin (Fisher et al., 1995). p97 and recombinant N D1 exist as homohexamers in solution (Peters et al., 1992; Kondo et al., 1997; data not shown). In the N D1 crystal structure, the 6-fold crystallographic axis is coincident with the molecular symmetry axis. Full-length endogenous p97 also crystallizes in a hexagonal lattice, supporting a symmetric p97 hexamer packing arrangement (our unpublished data). The N D1 hexamer forms a ring structure of a diameter ° ° of 160 A with a thickness between 20 and 40 A, and ° an inner hole of 15 A (Figures 1C and 1D). Looking toward the N terminus, the hexamer forms a wheel-like structure with N-terminal domains positioned counterclockwise in between two adjacent / domains. The surface of the hexamer is flat except for the deep nucleotide binding pocket that lies between protomers (Figures 1C and 1D). Looking from the C terminus, the surface is markedly more rugged, with a central funnel-shaped opening. The diameter of the funnel ranges from 15 ° to 70 A to form in part a cage-like structure. A side view shows the N-terminal domain in the same level and of similar height to the D1 hexamer (Figure 1D, yellow). Figure 1D also illustrates the flat top and more rugged C-terminal surface of the N D1 hexamer. The interprotomer contacts within the hexameric ring are formed primarily through interactions between adjacent / and C-terminal -helical domains (Figure 1E). Each protomer ° buries 11% (1500 A2) of the total solvent-accessible surface area for D1. Two interaction regions are particularly notable: 7 and the preceding loop interact with 9 from an adjacent protomer near the central opening in the hexamer; 5 and the surrounding region form interactions with the -helical domain at the outer rim of the hexamer (the extended helix-loop-helix structure comprising 12 and 13; Figure 1E). It is notable that 5 has few interactions with the rest of the / domain, suggesting that it may be a flexible region in terms of any possible rigid body movement of the / domain. We can speculate that the interactions between 5 and the extended helix-loop-helix at the outer rim of the hexamer are required to maintain hexamerization during any conformational changes induced by ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, 13 is conserved in most other D2 domains within the AAA family but is notably absent in NSF/Sec18 (see Figure 2B and supplemental figures at http://www. molecule.org/cgi/content/full/6/6/1473/DC1). Since NSF D2 has little ATPase activity (Matveeva et al., 1997), this loop may not be required. A structure-based sequence alignment shows that 70% of the residues involved in interprotomer contacts are conserved between the D1 domains of p97, VAT, and Cdc48p (see supplemental figures at http://www.molecule.org/cgi/ content/full/6/6/1473/DC1). In terms of D2 domains, nearly half of the interface residues are also conserved in p97, VAT, and Cdc48p (see supplemental figures at http://www.molecule.org/cgi/content/full/6/6/1473/DC1), suggesting a similar interprotomer interface for both the D1 and D2 hexamers, with the exception of NSF/Sec18. Very few interprotomer contact residues are conserved between p97 D1 and NSF D2, although the overall topology and hexameric arrangement are clearly similar (see Figures 2 and 5). In the N D1 crystal structure, we observe bound ADP,

but unlike NSF D2, the ADP adopts anti instead of syn conformation. For p97, the adenine ring is sandwiched between Leu-253 and Ile-380 (Figure 2D). Both residues are highly conserved within the AAA family except in NSF D2, where they are both replaced by Ala. In NSF D2, the adenine ring is bound between Ile-507 and Ile707 (Lenzen et al., 1998), corresponding to Val-206 and Gly-408 in p97 D1. These and other sequence differences result in a distinctly differently shaped adenine binding pocket (Figure 2D), possibly explaining the observed conformations adopted by bound nucleotides. Interestingly, the adenine ring also forms hydrogen bonds with residues of the N D1 linker region (Asp-205 [O] and Gly-207 [N, O]), suggesting a possible connection between the conformation of the N domain with respect to D1 and bound nucleotide. The adenine ring also forms hydrogen bonds with Thr-249 (O) and Gly250 (N), two highly conserved residues within the Walker A motif (P loop). The -phosphate interacts with Thr252 (N, O), which is one of the few absolutely conserved residues within the AAA family (Figure 2C). The -phosphate interacts with Gly-248 (N), Thr-249 (N), Lys-251 ( N), and Thr-252 (O), all of which are highly conserved and form part of the Walker A motif. The ADP -phosphate also hydrogen bonds with Asp-304 of the Walker B motif (DExx motif) via an ordered water molecule. However, we observe no Mg2 in our electron density maps despite the presence of 10 mM Mg2 in crystallization mixtures, which we attribute to the high salt concentration (4 M formate) used for N D1 crystallization. Interestingly, the Walker B motif is also involved in interprotomer contacts, since Glu-305 (DExx) forms a salt bridge with Arg-362 from a neighboring protomer (Figure 2D). Arg-362 is part of the AAA minimal consensus sequence and is highly conserved in a number of AAA proteins apart from, notably, NSF/Sec18 (Figure 2C). These interactions therefore couple Mg2 -ATP/ADP binding to interprotomer contacts, and could thus mediate any conformational changes induced by ATP hydrolysis or ADP release, including rearrangements of protomers within the hexamer. Furthermore, these residues are highly conserved in the AAA family, suggesting that the ADP and associated interprotomer interactions observed for p97 D1 are representative of other AAA proteins. Cryo-EM Reconstruction of Full-Length p97 In order to obtain a more complete structural description of p97, a single-particle analysis was undertaken using cryo-EM images of purified rat liver cytosol p97 (99.9% sequence identity to murine p97) in the presence of Mg2 -ADP. As a result, we have obtained the structure ° of full-length p97 at 18 A resolution (Figure 3). The p97 molecule consists of two distinct layers, clearly connected via well-defined densities, which together form ° a cage-like structure with overall dimensions of 145 A ° in diameter and 110 A in height (Figures 3A and 3B). These dimensions are similar to earlier lower resolution EM studies of NSF and p97 (Hanson et al., 1997) and VAT (Rockel et al., 1999). The 3D reconstruction reveals an internal cavity and openings on the lateral surface of the molecule (Figure 3). Interestingly, the p97 EM structure appears to have pseudo D6 symmetry, with a pseudo 2-fold axis in the middle of the molecule perpen-

(B) Comparison of p97 D1 ADP bound form (blue) with NSF D2 AMP­PNP bound form (green). P loops are superposed as are the - and -phosphates of ADP and AMP­PNP, respectively. However, the C-terminal -helical domain has rotated toward the / domain in p97 D1 (blue). Also note the different locations of the corresponding linker region (p97 D1, magenta; NSF D2, orange). (C) Sequence alignments of the highlighted regions in Figure 1A. Red represents conserved charged residues, while cyan represents conserved hydrophobic residues. Other conserved residues are colored in yellow. The sensor region is within the AAA minimum consensus region between Asn-348 and Arg-362. The indicated residue numbering is for p97. The linker region between the N and D1 domains contains conserved glycines at each end that could act as pivot points to allow the N domain and the linker loop to rotate as rigid bodies. (D) Comparison of nucleotide binding pockets for p97 D1 and NSF D2. The nucleotides, as well as the residues involved in ADP or AMP­PNP ° binding, are drawn as balls and sticks and labeled. The surface surrounding the nucleotide is drawn (8 A radius) to show the general shape of the binding pocket. An asterisk labels a residue from an adjacent protomer. The nucleotide has different conformations, probably due to the different sequences involved in nucleotide binding. Arg-362* interacts with Glu-305 (DExx box), while Arg-359* is available for -phosphate binding. Both residues could mediate any conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis or ADP release.

The main body of the molecule shows pseudo 2-fold symmetry along an axis perpendicular to the 6-fold, although there are protruding densities at one end ° ° (top). The overall molecular dimensions are indicated. The 145 A diameter of the EM map is less than the 160 A observed in the N D1 crystal structure, which we attribute to the ill-defined N domain in the EM reconstruction. (B) Cut-open view of (A) reveals a cage-like structure formed from the two-ring layers corresponding to the N D1 (blue) and D2 hexamers (green). (C) Top view, down the 6-fold axis, corresponding to the N D1 hexamer (blue), reveals a large annulus, surface pockets, and disconnected densities, and is different in appearance to the D2 layer. The black arrow indicates the pocket that coincides with the nucleotide binding pocket indicated by the arrow in Figure 1C. (D) Bottom view, corresponding to the D2 hexamer (green), shows a closed annulus and several distinctive surface features.

dicular to the 6-fold axis (see Figure 3B). The top surface ° of the structure has an annulus diameter of 34 A, whereas the bottom appears closed at the present resolution (Figures 3C and 3D). There are also pockets on both surfaces, with those on the top surface particularly deep (Figures 3C and 3D). The threshold of surface rendering was chosen such that the corresponding volume matches the 550 kDa molecular mass of p97. Extra densities observed around the outside rim of the top, more open, ring (Figure 3C), are reliable as they do not disappear at the higher threshold of surface rendering, though they are diffused at very low thresholds. We attribute this unconnected density to flexibility of that part of the ° structure. The 145 A diameter of the EM map is less ° than the 160 A observed in the N D1 crystal structure, which we attribute to the ill-defined N domain in the EM reconstruction. Fitting of N D1 Crystal Structure into EM Density In order to obtain a model of full-length p97, a homology model of D2 (40% sequence identity to D1) was con-

structed based on the crystal structure of D1 using the program JIGSAW (Bates and Sternberg, 1999). The secondary structures are all conserved between D1 and D2, though there are differences in two loop regions. One of them corresponds to a flexible loop close to the 6-fold axis, with three residues inserted in D2. This loop is also partially disordered in the D1 crystal structure. The other one corresponds to the loop between 12 and 13 on the edge of the hexamer interface, with one residue deleted in D2. Overall, the D2 model suggests a very similar hexamer interface as well as interactions with bound nucleotide to that of D1. The N D1 crystal structure and the D2 hexamer model were then docked into the full-length p97 EM density map (Figure 4). The best agreement places the N D1 crystal structure into the top, more open, ring, with N-terminal domains accounting for the disconnected density on the outside of the rim (Figure 4A). However, in the EM reconstruction, this density is shifted upward relative to the plane of the D1 ring in the X-ray structure (Figure 4C) and is disconnected from the main body. This would require

(A) Top view, showing the overall dimension of the D1 model agrees with the main body of the EM density. The partially disconnected EM density on the outer rim accounts for the flexible N domain that is not shown for the sake of clarity. (B) Bottom view, showing good agreement between the D2 model and EM reconstruction. (C) Side view of the p97 D1/D2 hexamer model fitted into EM density. The width and height are in agreement, though there are extra densities in the EM map between the D1 and D2 rings that could correspond to the C-terminal 73 residues. The locations of the -helical domains are indicated by long arrows. (D) Tilted side view highlighting one p97 D1/D2 monomer model fitted into the EM density. The C-terminal -helical domains from both the D1 and D2 protomers are located on the surface of the molecule near the 2-fold axis and could form part of an interhexamer interface. A possible linker region between D1 and D2 is indicated as a dashed yellow line. The short arrow indicates the location of the C termini of p97 D2.

a rearrangement in the position of the N domain relative to D1 and reflects the flexible nature of the N domain, with crystallization of N D1 capturing a specific conformation. However, at the present resolution, we are unable to accurately place the N domain into the EM map, and it is therefore omitted from our fitted models (Figure 4). To provide an accurate fit of the crystal structure into the EM map, we have used a systematic and conservative approach, using the program ESSENS (Kleywegt and Jones, 1997) and the D1 hexamer as a search model. The best solution places the nucleotide binding pockets of D1 into the deep pockets observed on the top surface of the EM map (see arrows in Figures 1C and 3C). Subsequent fitting of the D2 hexamer into the bottom closed ring using the same approach results in a pseudomirror

arrangement between D1 and D2, with a distance of ° 48 A between them (Figures 4B and 4C). This places the nucleotide binding pockets of D2 onto the other outer surface of the molecule resulting in a tail-to-tail arrangement for the D1 and D2 hexamers (Figures 4B and 4C). Such a fitting places the C-terminal -helical domains of both the D1 and D2 rings in close proximity to each other in the middle of the molecule (Figure 4C, arrows), and places the ATP binding sites on the exposed surfaces of the protein. This fit is consistent with the central cage-like features of the EM density, given that both the D1 and D2 hexamers have convex surfaces on their respective C-terminal sides. The length of the linker (26 residues) is adequate to link D1 and D2, and would be positioned on the surface in this current model

Molecular Cell 1480

with minimal overlap with the rest of the p97 molecule (Figure 4D). A surface linker is also consistent with protease sensitivity studies of NSF, which shows a cleavage pattern that results in three distinct fragments: N, D1, and D2 (Hanson et al., 1997). The observed difference in size of the D1 annulus between the EM and crystal structures (Figures 3C and 4A) may reflect either differences in bound nucleotide or interactions between the D1 and D2 domains in full-length p97. However, it should be noted that our final D1/D2 model represents a conservative fit of the p97 D1 crystal structure (and D2 homology model) into the EM reconstruction, as no adjustments have been made to the crystallographic hexamer to either improve the fit or take into account any conformational flexibility within the hexamer. A number of other packing arrangements for the D1 and D2 hexamers is possible, such as head-to-tail, where D1 and D2 stack on top of each other in the same orientation, or head-to-head, where the nucleotide binding pockets for each hexamer face inside the molecule. To check these and other packing arrangements, we took our N D1/D2 hexamer model and then adjusted each hexamer separately by flipping the D1 and D2 models 180 relative to their hexamer planes. Correlation scores for each new fit were then calculated using ESSENS (Kleywegt and Jones, 1997). The score obtained from placing D1 in the up position (see Figure 4) is significantly better than the best score obtained from the down position (score ratio of 1.3). A similar result was obtained by placing D2 in the down position relative to the up position, supporting a tail-to-tail arrangement as the best fit. Our current packing arrangement thus results in pseudo C2 symmetry between the D1 and D2 rings, and an 20 rotation of one ring relative to the other. A number of previous studies have suggested a headto-tail packing arrangement for the D1 and D2 hexamer rings (Hanson et al., 1997; Lenzen et al., 1998; Rockel et al., 1999). These studies have been based on lower resolution EM data (negative stain and quick freeze/ deep etch), and crystal lattice packing for NSF D2. Lenzen et al. (1998), for example, suggested a possible head-to-tail arrangement for NSF based on the NSF D2 crystal structure, the charge complementarity, and crystal lattice packing arrangements. However, the authors also noted that a substantial cavity between D1 and D2 would minimize any stabilizing effects due to charge complementarity (Lenzen et al., 1998). In the p97 N D1 crystal lattice, both tail-to-tail and head-to-head arrangements are observed. In the VAT EM study (Rockel et al., 1999), the NSF D2 crystal structure was fitted into the negatively stained EM density suggesting a head-to-tail arrangement of D1/D2 domains, though it could be argued that the resolution of the EM reconstruction would make it difficult to distinguish one orientation from the other. Our reconstruction of p97 molecules in a hydrated environment, combined with higher resolution and carefully evaluated fitting, now provides a more accurate conformational arrangement for the D1 and D2 rings. Structure Comparisons with Other AAA Family Members The structures of N domains from NSF, Sec18, and VAT have previously been determined using either crystal-

lography or NMR (Babor and Fass, 1999; Coles et al., 1999; May et al., 1999; Yu et al., 1999). Here, we also report the structure of an N domain, but unlike previous studies the N domain is linked to its subsequent D1 domain. Superposition of all four N domains reveals a surprising similarity in both domain topology and interdomain arrangement (Figure 2A), despite the low sequence identity or structure determination method (sequence ID range: 8%­25%; 50% of residues can be ° superposed 1 A rmsd on C ). Thus, N domains can be considered as single structural elements comprising two conserved subdomains that pack similarly in a number of different proteins. Further support for this notion comes from one of the reported NSF N domain crystal structures (May et al., 1999), where three independent copies of the N-terminal domain all adopt the same subdomain interactions and arrangement. A superposition of the double barrels of NSF/Sec18 and p97/VAT/Cdc48p reveals detailed differences. The first loop in p97/VAT/Cdc48p (residues 32­37) is significantly shorter when compared to NSF/Sec18, where the loop is replaced with a two-turn helix. Studies on other double barrel structures suggest that loops are typically involved in substrate binding or catalytic interactions (Castillo et al., 1999). The fact that p97 has a shorter and more rigid surface loop makes it tempting to speculate that the loop is involved in binding to the p97 adaptor protein p47. Coles et al. (1999) have shown that the VAT N domain can bind polypeptides, catalyze the refolding of certain substrates, and prevent protein aggregation. They propose a binding site that lies between the loops of the amino-terminal double barrel and the flexible loops of the C-terminal barrel that corresponds to a band of positive charge across the upper face of the molecule. Babor and Fass (1999) and Yu et al. (1999) both propose similar SNAP binding sites for NSF between the two subdomains in a region of positive charge. For p97, the large -turn- structure (residues 153­157) in the barrel subdomain, together with the first loop, forms a hydrophobic cleft that may provide another p47 binding site (the p97­p47 complex is stable up to 0.4 M salt; H. K., unpublished data). Further studies are in progress to address these issues. p97 D1 and NSF D2 have similar topologies and domain arrangements (Figure 2B). A superposition of individual protomers results in 28% of all residues having ° rmsd 1 A (C ). However, more than half the residues ° in the / domain have rmsd 1 A (C ), which is due to a small rotation of the C-terminal -helical domain relative to the / domain (Figure 2B). In p97 D1, the cleft formed between these two domains is slightly closed compared to that of NSF D2 (Figure 2B). This domain movement may reflect structural differences in nucleotide binding states between the NSF D2 and p97 D1 structures, namely AMP­PNP versus ADP (see below). In p97 D1, the N D1 linker (Figures 2B and 5A, magenta) is pushed outward, while the corresponding linker region in NSF D2 (Figures 2B and 5A, orange) is positioned between the / domain and the -helical domain, in between protomers. Interestingly, if this orientation is applied to p97, the N domains would be positioned on top of the hexamer ring, as proposed previously for NSF (May et al., 1999). A superposition of both hexamers shows the P loops ° to have similar conformations (0.3 A rmsd [C ]). In addi-

Figure 5. Speculative Model of p97 Acting as a Molecular Ratchet (A) Superposition of p97 D1 in an ADP state (blue) with NSF D2 in an ATP state (green) on their respective P loops. A small clockwise rotation around the hexamer axis is observed between the green and blue monomers. ADP moieties are drawn as brown spheres. Also shown are the corresponding linker regions between p97 N D1 (magenta) and NSF D1/D2 (orange). (B) Possible ratchet mechanism for p97 with D1 and D2 rings acting as interdependent and counter-balanced parts in the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Top left, the D1 and D2 rings are shown as ATP- and ADP-bound states, respectively. ATP hydrolysis of D1 would cause a clockwise rotation of D1. Top right, the rotation of D1 causes a conformational change in D2 to allow ADP release, resulting in an ATP-ready or empty state, while D1 returns to an ADP-bound state. Bottom right, ATP hydrolysis in D2 would cause a counterclockwise motion. Bottom left, the rotation caused by D2 would allow the release of ADP in D1, resulting in an ATP-ready state, while D2 returns to an ADP-bound state. The binding of ATP by D1 would initiate another hydrolysis cycle (top left).

tion, residues involved in -phosphate binding in NSF D2 (Lys-557 and Asp-612) are conserved in p97 D1 (Lys251 and Asp-305), with the exception of Lys-639. In p97, Arg-359 from an adjacent protomer is at a position similar to Lys-639, suggesting that Arg-359 could bind the -phosphate in p97 D1. Furthermore, residues involved in Mg2 binding in NSF D2 (Thr-557, Asp-611, and Asp-612) are also conserved in p97 D1 (Thr-252, Asp-304, and Asp-305, respectively), as well as in the whole AAA family. It is plausible, therefore, that p97 N D1 will bind ATP (or AMP­PNP) using similar interactions to those observed for NSF D2. If the P loops are used to superpose both hexamers, the - and -phosphates ° of ADP and AMP­PNP align structurally (0.7 A rmsd; Figures 2B and 5A). Such a superposition is relevant, since it is known that in other ATPases the P loop is generally static upon nucleotide hydrolysis (Smith and Rayment, 1996). From these structural comparisons, it is not unreasonable to assume that the NSF D2 AMP­PNP complex is representative of a p97 D1­ATP complex, although further experimental evidence is required to confirm this issue, namely a p97­ATP complex structure. The AAA family in general is characterized by a number of well-defined sequence motifs, such as the P loop (Walker A), DExx box (Walker B), and the AAA minimal consensus sequence (Neuwald et al., 1999). It is well established that P loops are involved in nucleotide binding, while the DExx box is involved in Mg2 binding and indirectly in nucleotide binding. The p97 N D1 structure now shows that the DExx box is also involved in interprotomer contacts, and by inference, hexamerization. A

possible link between ATP hydrolysis and interprotomer rearrangements mediated partly by the DExx box is intriguing. The p97 N D1 structure reported here is one of the first structural descriptions for an active ATPase AAA domain and is thus more representative of other AAA family proteins. Speculative Conformational Changes upon ATP Hydrolysis and Possible Ratchet Mechanism of p97 In order to assess any possible conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis, we attempted to grow and/or soak crystals in ADP, AMP­PNP, or ATP­ S. However, we observed only bound ADP, which we attribute to the formation of a stable N D1­ADP complex prior to purification. We were unable to remove the bound ADP in nondenaturing conditions, suggesting that the N D1­ ADP complex is highly stable. In order to obtain insights into any possible conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis, we compared the p97 D1­ADP hexamer with that of NSF­ATP (AMP­PNP; Lenzen, et al., 1998; Yu et al., 1998). We note that such a comparison between two different proteins sharing limited sequence identity in different nucleotide-bound states can be misleading, and thus the following discussion should be considered as purely speculative. A superposition of the p97 D1 and NSF D2 hexamers, based on their respective P loops, shows that although the general protomer contacts are maintained, a small apparent clockwise rotation is observed for p97 D1 protomers with respect to NSF (Figure 5A; p97, blue; NSF, green). This clockwise rotation of the p97 hexamer with

Molecular Cell 1482

respect to the NSF hexamer (using fixed P loops) centers around the surface helix 8, and might reflect the conformational shift between the ATP and ADP states for p97 D1. Based on this structural comparison, we also propose that for p97 D1, residues Asn-348 to Arg-359 act as -phosphate sensors (Figures 1A and 1E, red), with Arg-359 directly contacting the ATP -phosphate bound to an adjacent protomer, while Asn-348 from the adjacent protomer could be positioned on the other side of the -phosphate (see Figure 1E, near the protomer interface; Asn-348, yellow; Arg-359, blue). This region is within the conserved AAA minimum consensus sequence and has previously been proposed as a -phosphate sensor for the family (Neuwald et al., 1999). The fitting of the D1/D2 structure/model into the cryoEM density of a full-length p97­ADP complex suggests tail-to-tail packing with their respective nucleotide binding sites at opposite ends of the molecule. The EM reconstruction also suggests that D1 and D2 of p97 could exist in different nucleotide-bound states. This, combined with the possible conformational changes discussed above, allows us to speculate on a conceptual model for p97 acting as a molecular ratchet, with the D1 and D2 hexameric rings forming two interconnected but negatively cooperating parts. In this model, ATP hydrolysis within one hexameric ring (e.g., D1) would promote ADP release in the D2 ring resulting in an ATP-ready (empty) conformation for D2 (Figure 5B, top row). Given that the D1 and D2 rings are related by pseudo C2 symmetry, subsequent ATP binding and hydrolysis by D2 would promote ADP release from the D1 ring to form an ATP-ready/empty state (Figure 5B, bottom row). In support of this speculative model is the observation that site-specific mutations that abolish ATPase activity within one hexamer affects the ATPase activity in the other (H. K., unpublished data), consistent with the notion that both hexameric rings are coupled for full catalytic activity. However, experimental support of the proposed model requires a full-length p97 structure and further mutagenesis studies. Nevertheless, the combined X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM structures presented here provide some insights into the possible mechanism of p97, and now form the basis for further experiments aimed at explaining the finer details of conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis, adaptor binding, and possible SNARE disassembly.
Experimental Procedures Expression, Purification, and Crystallization DNA encoding residues 2­458 (N and D1 domains) of murine p97 was amplified by PCR from a full-length p97 cDNA and cloned into pPRO-EX HTb (Life Technologies). Recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli ER2566 (New England Biolabs) by induction of a midlog-phase culture with 1 mM IPTG. Cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 20 mM imidazole, and 500 mM NaCl, and lysed in a French pressure cell or by sonication. Recombinant N D1 was eluted from a HiTrap chelating column (equilibrated with nickel sulfate) with a linear gradient of 20­500 mM imidazole in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 500 mM NaCl, and the His tag cleaved with rTEV protease as per the manufacturer's (Life Technologies) instructions. Cleaved N D1 was dialyzed into 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 600 mM KCl, and 2 mM -mercaptoethanol, and concentrated to 16 mg/ml as determined by the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay before adding nucleotide (ADP, ATP- -S, or AMP­PNP) for a final concentration of 10 mM. Crystals were obtained in 24­72 hr at room

temperature by hanging drop vapor diffusion after mixing equal volumes of 16 mg/ml N D1 with reservoir solutions containing 3.8­4.2 M sodium formate, 10% glycerol, and 5% PEG600 (pH 5.5­6.0). Derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals in mother liquor containing 50 mM GdCl3 for 16 hr and 10 mM mercuric acetate for 4 hr. Crystals were obtained in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM ADP, AMP­PNP, or ATP- -S, and in the absence of added nucleotide and MgCl2. All crystal forms were subsequently found to contain only ADP. Attempts to produce nucleotide-free forms of N D1 using multiple steps of exhaustive dialysis against EDTA followed by further dialyses against activated charcoal produced only ADP-bound crystals, suggesting that a highly stable N D1­ADP complex is formed before purification. Data Collection, Phasing, and Refinement Diffraction data were collected using crystals flash frozen at ­110 K directly from the mother liquor, and then annealed for 5 s before being refrozen. Data for the mercury acetate derivative were measured using a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode source equipped with Yale mirrors and an RAXIS-II imaging plate. Native data were collected at X11 beamline of the DESY synchrotron in Hamburg, using a MAR 345 mm image plate. Gadolinium MAD data were collected on the BM14 beamline at ESRF Grenoble, using a MAR CCD detector. The space group is P622 with unit cell dimensions a b ° ° 146.0 A, c 84.7 A with one monomer per asymmetric unit. Data processing was carried out using HKL (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997), and the final statistics are summarized in Table 1. The structure was solved by MAD methods combined with single isomorphous replacement (SIR). Diffraction data were collected at three wavelengths around the Gd LIII absorption edge on GdCl2-derivatized ° crystals along with a far remote data set collected at 0.973 A. Three Gd sites were identified using anomalous differences measured at the peak wavelength as input into the program SHELXS (Sheldrick, 1990). These were then refined and phases obtained using the program SHARP (de La Fortelle and Bricogne, 1997), with the best statistics being obtained when including only the far remote and ° inflection point (1.71 A) data sets. These two wavelength MAD phases were then combined with the phases from the mercury acetate derivative using the CCP4 programs (CCP4, 1994). The phasing ° statistics are summarized in Table 1. The resulting maps at 3.0 A allowed a trace of most of the backbone apart from the N-terminal region and some surface loops that were missing. After each cycle of tracing and rebuilding using O (Jones et al., 1991), the partial model was subjected to an energy minimization refinement with a maximum likelihood target using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998), and ¨ phases were combined with experimental phases to produce improved maps that enabled further model building. After building the backbone of residues 21­430, the model was refined using a native ° data set to 2.9 A resolution, and side chains were gradually added after careful inspections of 2Fo­Fc maps. Simulated annealing as implemented in CNS was used for subsequent refinement, using a starting temperature of 2500 K. A random 10% of the starting data was set aside for cross validation (free R factor calculation). During refinement, clear continuous density was observed within the active site region corresponding to ADP. Subsequent refinement of crystals formed in the presence of different nucleotides always revealed density corresponding to ADP. Simulated annealing omit maps also confirmed the presence of ADP. A number of ordered water molecules was also added during the refinement, and the final model contains residues 21­458 of murine p97, one ADP, and 51 water molecules resulting in a free R factor of 28.3% and an R factor of 22.4%. Refinement statistics are also listed in Table 1. In the final model, 20 residues at the N terminus that are not visible in our electron density maps are missing, as are the side chains for 23 surface charge residues (replaced by Ala). The loop regions between residues 337­339, 312­316, and 432­437 also have poor electron density. All residues lie in allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot (82.4% in most favored regions). Cryomicroscopy and 3D Image Processing Full-length rat liver p97 was purified as described (Kondo et al., 1997), and vitrified specimens were prepared for cryo-EM as described (Dubochet et al., 1988) and transferred to a CM200 FEG

cryomicroscope using a Gatan side entry cryo holder. Images were taken under low-dose conditions, at 38,000-fold magnification and 2.5 0.5 m defocus. The micrographs were digitized using an Image Science GmbH (Berlin, Germany) patchwork densitometer at ° a step size of 2.8 A on the specimen scale. The contrast transfer function of the microscope (CTF) was determined by finding zero positions of Thon rings (Erickson and Klug, 1970) for each micrograph separately. Correction of CTF was done by reversing phases of odd rings; amplitudes were not corrected. Since images were taken using a range of different defocus values, the structure was not affected by zeroes in the CTF. Molecular images were selected interactively. Image processing was performed using the IMAGIC-5 software (van Heel et al., 1996) on DEC workstations running UNIX. The images were subjected to multireference alignment (van Heel, 1989) and automated classification (Dube et al., 1993). Relative orientations of characteristic views (van Heel and Stoffler-Meilicke, 1985) were defined by angular re¨ constitution (van Heel, 1987), assuming C6 symmetry. The 3D distribution of molecular densities were reconstructed using the exact filter back projection algorithm (van Heel and Harauz, 1986; Radermacher, 1988), and then iteratively refined (Schatz et al., 1995). The final 3D reconstruction was calculated from 150 class averages that included 3100 original molecular images. The handedness of the hexamer was determined by comparison with the N D1 crystal structure. The contour level used for rendering of the 3D maps was taken at 1 above the level of the average density in the map. The resolution of the resulting maps was assessed using FSC criteria (van Heel and Harauz, 1986). We have taken into account that the structure has 6-fold symmetry, meaning that the threshold has been increased by 6 (Dube et al. 1995). Surface rendering was performed using the Iris Explorer. The fitting of the X-ray structure into the EM map was performed using ESSENS (Kleywegt and Jones, 1997) and inspected in O (Jones et al., 1991).
