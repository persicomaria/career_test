CORRIGENDUM

Corrigendum to "Structural Basis for the Phosphorylation-regulated Focal Adhesion Targeting of Type I Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinase (PIPKI) by Talin" [J. Mol. Biol. 359 (2006) 47­54]

On page 49, we stated that: "The overall fold of talin PTB and its peptide binding mode are similar to previously characterized talin/target complexes;"19,28 however, a more detailed structural comparison was not provided. We note here that the talin/target complexes we cited correspond to the chimeric crystal structures of talin-PTB-containing fragment (talin F2-F3) bound to the integrin 3 tail19 and to the unphosphorylated PIPKI peptide (DERSWVY644 SPLHYSA),28 respectively. In particular, the unphosphorylated PIPKI peptide in the crystal structure28 binds to talin-PTB in virtually the same way as the Y644-phosphorylated PIPKI peptide (SWVpY644SPLH) in our NMR structure, a similarity that we should have emphasized. Rather, we focused on the electrostatic triad, which phosphotyrosine 644 forms at the binding interface. We regret the omission of a more detailed discussion of these similarities.
