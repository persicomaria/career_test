The crystal and molecular structure of a triacylglyceride lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) from the fungus Rhizomucor miehei was analyzed using X-ray single crystal diffraction data to 1.9 A resolution. The structure was refined to an R-factor of 0169 for all available data. The details of the molecular architecture and the crystal structure of the enzyme are described. A single polypeptide chain of 269 residues is folded into a rather unusual singly wound j-sheet domain with predominantly parallel strands, connected by a variety of hairpins. loops and helical segments. All the loops are right-handed, creating an uncommon situation in which the central sheet is asymmetric in that all the connecting fragments are located on one side of the sheet. A single N-terminal a-helix provides the support for the other. distal. side of the sheet. Three disulfide bonds (residues 29-268, 40-43, 235-244) stabilize the molecule. There are four cis peptide bonds, all of which precede proline residues. In all, 230 ordered water molecules have been identified; 12 of them have a distinct internal character. The catalytic center of the enzyme is made up of a constellation of three residues (His25T. Asp203 and Ser144) similar in structure and funct'ion to the analogous (but not homologous) triad found in both of the known families of serine proteinases. The fourth residue in this system equivalent to Thr/Ser in proteinases), hydrogen bonded to Asp. is Tyr260. The catalytic site is concealed under a short amphipatic helix (residues 85 to 91), which acts as "lid", opening the active site when the enzyme is adsorbed at the oil-water int,erface. In the native enzyme the "lid" is held in place by hydrophobic interactions.

1. Introduction 3.1.1.3), Triacylglyceride hydrolases (EC commonly known as neutral lipases, constitute a ubiquitous and diverse family. In mammals they play a key role in lipid digestion (e.g. lingual, gastric and pancreatic lipases), reconstitution and catabolism (e.g. intestinal lipases, hepatic, lipoprotein and lysosomal lipases). The recent advances in lipoprotein biochemistry and the impact these studies have on various medical problems, such as obesity interest in atherosclerosis, stimulated and structure-function relationships in these enzymes.

potential of lipases,

although in this case bacterial and fungal enzymes appear to be more useful. In spite of this interest, relatively little is known so far about the molecular architecture of lipases. To date, preliminary accounts of crystal structure determinations for three neutral triglyceride lipases have been reported: an extracellular enzyme purified from a fungus Rhizomucor miehei (RmL$: Brady et al., 1990), human pancreatic lipase

R. miehei Lipase at 1.9 d Resolution (Winkler et al., 1990) and, most recently, another fungal enzyme from Geotrychum candidurn (Schrag et al., 1991). All three enzymes contain mixed (though predominantly parallel) /?-pleated sheets, although the connectivities between strands vary. In all cases the active centers were found to be buried. In RmL a short helix, referred to as the "lid", covers the active site and its displacement in response to the enzyme's adsorption to an oil-water interface was postulated as the structural basis for the phenomenon of interfacial activation (Brady et al., 1990). Similarly, a conformational change was also postulated by Winkler et aE. (1990) for the human pancreatic lipase (hPL) and by Schrag et al. (1991) for the G. candidum lipase (GcL). Recently, single crystals of RmL complexed with a covalent inhibitor (n-hexylphosphonate-ethylester) were obtained and the subsequent crystallographic resolution analysis carried out at 3A (1 A = 0.1 nm) demonstrated that the helical lid of RmL indeed undergoes a dramatic hinged body type movement (Brzozowski et al., 1991). Another crystallographic study at 2.6 A resolution of RmL by diethyl p-nitrophenylphosphate inhibited (Derewenda et al., 1992) confirmed these results and provided a more detailed molecular description of the activated enzyme. No other structures of lipases in their "active" state have been reported to date. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the threedimensional structure of the Rhizomucor miehei
enzyme in its native form. A full account of the

yielded a fully interpretable map. The atomic model was refined further by restrained crystallographic refinement and the hydrogen atoms were generated using XPLOR (Brunger, 1988). The co-ordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number TGL3). Unless otherwise specified, all the programs referred to in this paper have been used in their Vax VMS or Silicon Graphics Unix versions of the CCP4 suite of crystallographic programs (SERC Daresbury Laboratory, U.K.). A CCP4 version of FRODO (Jones, 1978) modified by Dr P. Evans (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, U.K.) for a PS330 Evans & Sutherland computer graphics system was used for all structural comparisons.

3. Results and Discussion
(a) Quality of the rejkement and of the structure The final structure consists of 2289 non-hydrogen atoms of which 230 are water oxygens. Table 1 shows some of the stereochemical parameters of this model; full details are given by Brzozowski et al. (1992). The mean error in co-ordinates calculated according to the method of Luzzati (1952) was R-factor was 613 A. The final crystallographic 9129 for data with a low-resolution cutoff of 7.5 A and an intensity cutoff of 2o(F). In addition, those reflections for which P&FC,,C or F~,,/F,,,, exceeded 2.5 were also excluded. The latter criterion was introduced to eliminate the bad reflections not screened out during the merging step. The probability of such bad errors in area detector data sets is relatively high and we find that the elimination of even a handful of such bad terms improves the quality of refinement. Consequently, out of 19,404 unique reflections, 18,960 were used. The variation of the R-factor with resolution (Table 2) shows the expected increase at low and high-resolution ends; the former is associated with inaccurate description of the solvent continuum and the lack of hydrogen atoms, while the latter arises from the decrease in the value of F/a(F) and the quality of data. The average temperature (B) factor, including solvent molecules, is 22.3 A'. This value is within the range normally observed in protein crystals. An analysis of the final difference electron density map and of the temperature factors for the water molecules indicates no ions or molecules heavier than water.

2. Materials and Methods
Crystallization, data collection, phasing and refinement have been described in detail elsewhere (Brzozowski et aZ., 1992). A short summary is given below. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method. Purified recombinant protein, expressed in Aspergillus

oryzae was dissolved in 20 mn-Tris. HCI (pH &05) to a
concentration of 15 to 16 mg/ml; 55 to 75% (v/v of saturated solution) phosphate buffer was used as a precipitant to grow single crystals. The crystals were b = 75.0 A, orthorhombic a = 71.6 A, u3,212,, c = 55-O A) with a specific volume of 2.5 A3 per dalton indicating solvent content of -45%, well within the range expected for globular proteins. Native data to l-9 A resolution and all heavy atom derivative data were collected using the Xentronics (Siemens) area detector and processed using the XENGEN suite of programs (Howard et al., 1987). Three derivatives (Hg, Pt and I) were used. Partial interpretation of the multiple isomorphous replacement (m.i.r.) electron density map was made possible with the assistance of a molecular replacement solution using the atomic model of the Humicola lanuginoso lipase (for a full account of the chronology of this study, see Brozozowski et al., 1992). Many of the loops, however, were not visible, and routine least-squares refinement did not result in any significant improvment. Poly-Ala segments were introduced in place of these loops and simulated annealing (Brunger, 1988) was used to find their conformations. Two rounds of this procedure finally

Figure 1 shows the variation in the isotropic temperature factors along the polypeptide chain. A small number of residues, which are poorly defined in the density and which are characterized by B-values, are all located on the surface of the molecule. Somewhat diffuse density characterized a number of leucine side-chains, and in these cases it was not possible to distinguish between two possible conformations. The first four N-terminal residues are not visible in the electron density map and are not included in the model. Apart from these cases, no examples of static disorder are found in the structure. All non-proline peptide bonds are trans, and there are no unusual features that could indicate any serious errors in the atomic model.

However, it exhibits a number of interesting features with possible bearing on our understanding of the evolution of the prot'ein folding patterns. RmL contains a central mixed P-sheet made up of eight major strands (1 to 8) and one additional short strand (8') (Figs 2(a), 3 and 4). With the exception of this last strand (8'), all strands are sequential and

strands is 3-2-14-5-6. As a vast majority of CC-/~ and B-U turns are right-handed with the neighantiparallel p-sheet strands usually boring connected by short hairpin turns, a long singly wound /?-sheet must be highly asymmetric, i.e. the sheet has to be covered by the connecting helices and loops located on only one side (which we will refer to as the proximal side) and exposed on the other (or distal) side. Richardson (1981) noted, that among all the proteins belonging to the parallel a/p family, even those which are clearly distant and which have been classified as miscellaneous (such as

carboxypeptidase), share with the rest of the group the general organization of the central sheet of hydrophobic p-strands (parallel or antiparallel) protected on both sides by its connections. In RmL. the dramatic asymmetry is rectified by a single N-terminal a-helix folded onto the distal side of the b-sheet in a perpendicular fashion. The position of the helix is stabilized by a short N-terminal pentapeptide (residues 5 to 9) that forms an extra B-strand (8') hydrogen bonded to the C-terminal eighth major strand. The folding pattern of RmL may constitute an

The latter family is rapidly expanding as there are currently 19 members (Branden, 1992) and is recognized as one of the major folding patterns. Although the enzymes which belong to this family catalyze a variety of unrelated reactions, it has been postulated that they may still be related (Farber & Petsko, 1990). The fold of the parallel P-barrel is essentially that of a sequential parallel /?-sheet with right-handed turns, very reminiscent of RmL. The asymmetry of the sheet and the exposure of its distal side may be the reasons behind its "collapse" and the formation of the barrel. The proteins with simple sequential mixed central p-sheets (like the one in RmL) may, therefore, be likely candidates for the ancestral fold of both parallel B-barrels and parallel or mixed a//I proteins. The folding pattern of RmL is in some contrast to that observed in hPL and GcL (Fig. Z(b)). GcL and the larger, catalytic N-terminal domain of hPL share the same P-sheet topology found also in wheat serine carboxypeptidase II (Liao & Remington, acetylcholinesterase from (Ache) 19gf)), T. calijornica (Sussman et al., 1991), dienelactone hydrolase (Pathak & Ollis, 1990), and holoalkane dehalogenase (Franken et al., 1991). The difference between RmL and these other enzymes is primarily in the order of strands, with a crossover connection between strands 2 and 3 observed in the latter family. The oligopeptide containing the active nucleophile (SerI44) consists of a six-residue p-strand (strand 4 of the central sheet), a four-residue turn of type II' with serine in the e-conformation, and a buried a-helix directly linking strands 4 and 5 of the central P-pleated sheet. The /?-strand and the helix glycines are tightly packed together. The invariant in positions (1) and (5) of this so-called lipase/ esterase consensus sequence (G-X-S-X-G) are in extended and helical conformations, respectively. They are conserved because of the steric restrictions imposed on these residues by the packing stereochemistry of this fi-eSer-a motif, and not by secondary structure requirements, as is the case in serine proteinases. An extensive analysis of the amino acid sequences in proteins containing the esterase consensus sequence allowed Derewenda & Derewenda (1991) to identify conserved packing interactions that suggested that the whole structural motif is likely to be found in all known serine esterases and other lipases, indicating a possible evolutionary link of these families of hydrolytic structure enzymes. The acetylcholinesterase published subsequently, (Sussman et al., 1991) was in full agreement with that prediction. The folding of the polypeptide chain in RmL is stabilized by three disulfide bridges: Cys40-Cys43, Cys29-Cys268 and Cys235-Cys244. Their conformations illustrated by the five dihedral angles, are shown in Figure 5. All are right-handed, although they do not belong to any of the standard classes of right-handed hooks and right-handed spirals

Only three residues fall outside the usual limits of the Ramachandran plot: Cys244, Ser144 (the nucleophile, already discussed above) and Glu201. In all three cases, the electron density is well defined (see Brzozowski et al., 1992) and the low values of the B-factors are indicative of proper convergence of refinement. Both Glu201 and Ser144 occur in tight four-residue-long hairpin turns that may be broadly classified as type II' (Sibanda et al., 1989) or the s-turn, in which residues (2) and (3) exhibit the E and a-conformations (following the nomenclature introduced by Efimov, 1986), respectively. Cys244, involved in a disulfide bridge with Cys235, exhibits a less commonly observed conformation (4 = - log", $ = - 128"). An analysis of this region revealed that the plane of the peptide 244-245 is stacked against the indole ring of Trp223. Thus while the 4 angle is well within the usual range, the ti angle is strained. Cys244 is not, however, the only example of this conformation. Leu220 of the Staphylococcus aureus fl-lactamase refined at 2.0 A resolution (Herzberg, 1991) exhibits an identical (4 = - 108", secondary structure $ = - 125"). This similarity may indicate a distinct

minimum in an otherwise high-energy region of conformational space. The conformation of only three glycine residues (81, 219 and 266) is outside the allowed Ramachandran region. We find no obvious reasons, other than general folding requirements, for the stereochemistry of these amino acids. There are nine strands in the central p-sheet. The notation used in the paper reflects their fold: strands 1 to 8 are ordered according to the sequence, whereas 8' is the ninth strand formed by the N terminus folded onto the C-terminal end of the sheet. There are five a-helices in the RmL molecule, defined as fragments containing at least four consecutive amino acid residues in the aR conformation: residues 11 to 27, 85 to 91, 109 to 132, 146 to 159, 182 to 191 and 254 to 257). In addition, there are several highly helical regions, which nonetheless were not classified as continuous helices because of severe irregularities. The two longest such fragments occur between residues 41 and 48, and between 242 and 248 (see Table 3 for details of the conformations). The longest a-helix (109-132) has a pronounced kink caused by Val118, which adopts the yR conformation (Fig. 6). As a result, the hydrogen-bonding pattern is affected and carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly116, Glul17 and Asn120 as well as the main-chain amide groups of Asnl20 and
Glu121 participate in hydrogen bonds with water

(ii)(b)?% central b-sheet Figure 3(c) illustrates diagrammatically the hydrogen bonding of all the peptide groups involved in the central b-sheet. Of the nine strands, seven run one way and only two in the opposite direction; the central five strands constitute a contiguous parallel sheet. Most of the hydrogen bonds fall within the expected range (Baker & Hubbard, 1984), with only few minor exceptions: Gly142 N . ,172 0 (3.32 A) is evidently weak in spite of its int'ernal character, while the carbonyl atoms of Arg196 and Va1232 show bifurcated bonds involving water molecules in addition to amides. There are two classic p-bulges that occur, as expected (Richardson, 1981), between a narrow pair of hydrogen bonds on an antiparallel pair of strands. The first of these is located on strand 1 and involves residue Ile52 which exhibits, in a classic conformation (4 = - 75", fashion, a helical I+!I -43"). The second B-bulge occurs in a structur= ally similar environment at the end of st,rand 7, where Thr225 adopts a ~a conformation. (ii)(c) The P-hairpins and loops The predominantly parallel character of the p-sheet implies that most interstrand connections are of the /T-a-~ right-handed type (see Figs 3 and 4). There are only three pairs of antiparallel strands
contiguous in sequence and linked by b-hairpins: 1-2, 2-3 and 7-8. The first two hairpins can be classified as four-

The following conventions are used: 1 indicates B-strands; 11indicates a-helices; + denotes a free amide or carbonyl group (no hydrogen-bonding partner); ! +! denotes a buried free amide or carbonyl group; @, denotes a disallowed Ramachandran conformation: (11)denotes a p-bridge: ::::: denotes a kink in helix 3; # denotes atoms from symmetry-related molecules.

(Fig. 7), because it does not form a direct link between two antiparallel strands: an amino acid exhibiting the j.?r conformation (the proline region of the Ramachandran plot is inserted on each side of the loop immediately after or in front of a p-strand. The second turn (between strands 2 and 3), on the other hand, is classic in that it connects the two

respective b-strands directly (Fig. 8). The last loop (between strands 7 and 8) is also of the 4 : 4 type, but more unusual (Fig. 9). It occurs immediately after the /?-bulge on strand 7 and the four amino acid residues are in ya-&p-j? conformation. It is interesting to note that none of the amide groups involved is hydrogen bonded.

Figure 7. B-Hairpin I: hydrogen bonds are shown as broken lines, while adjacent bonding to the turn are shown as heavy lines.
There are only two short helix-turn-strand loops. A four-residue turn connects helix (3) with the

residues involved

in hydrogen

fourth strand of the sheet; residues Tyr133, Pro123, Ser135 and Tyr136 atopt 6, aR, yR and /3-conformations, respectively. A three-residue turn occurs between helix (5) and strand (6) and contains which is in the left-handed helical Gly192,
conformation.

A unique strand-turn-helix motif at the end of strand 4 has already been mentioned. It contains the active Ser144, and is predicted to be a structurally conserved element among lipases and esterases (for a detailed description of this motif, see Derewenda 6 Derewenda, 1991). There are four long surface loops in RmL, which

lack clearly defined fragments of secondary structure. They are: residues 28 to 49 (the loop connecting the N-terminal helix with the first strand of the b-sheet), residues 92 to 108 (a connection between the lid and helix (3)), residues 160 to 168 (connecting helix (4) with strand (5)) and 201 to 219 (the loop connecting 2 parallel strands (6 and 7) of the sheet). All these fragments just fail the criteria for 0 loops as defined by Leszczynski 6 Rose (1986), as the distance between the terminal C" atoms are 142 8, 121 A, 11.8 A and 14.1 .&, respectively. They do, however, exhibit many other features characteristic of surface loops. They include less than a quarter of the amino acid residues (24.1%), but account for 32% of the surface area.

Figure 9. B-Hairpin III: details as for Fig. 7. In all, 34 (52.3%) of the main-chain carbonyl groups, and 13 (20 %) of amide groups are hydrated in this group, while six carbonyl groups and 8 amide groups have no hydrogen-bonding partners at all (see section (iii)(a) for overall statistics). The most unusual of these loops is the fragment which connects the C-terminal end of the "lid" with helix (3). It has a "twisted" head consisting of two proline residues with a twist region made up of an antiparallel bridge (residues 87 and 107). Its N-terminal end participates in the conformational rearrangement which takes place during the enzyme's activation. There are also two extended polypeptide fragments which lack defined secondary structure: residues 175 to 181 and 236 to 253. The first of these is a buried fragment that connects strand 5 of the sheet with the lid; five of the amino acid residues are in the p-conformation but do not participate in a sheet. The second, much longer solvent-exposed segments is a part of the C-terminal fragment. The last 12 residues of the molecule also form an extended segment. (iii) Hydrogen bonding and solvent structure (iii)(a) Main-chain hydrogen bonds bonds of type There are 190 hydrogen O(i). . . H-NO); this constitutes 70% of the total possible and is only slightly higher than the 61 y. reported by Baker & Hubbard (1984) for a large sample of globular proteins. Of these, 68 occur in a-helices (or l-4 helical turns) and 66 in parallel and anti-parallel bridges; 63 (63.4%) of carbonyl groups are hydrated, but have no other hydrogen bonding partners (Baker & Hubbard, 1984, give an identical figure of 23.4% of hydrated carbonyl groups in proteins); 20 (7.4%) do not seem to have any hydrogen-bonding partners at all. In comparison, out of all the NH groups, 46 (17.0 "/b) are only hydrated. and 20 have no hydrogen-bonding partners. The proportions of non-bonded CO and NH groups are smaller than those reported by Baker & Hubbard (1984) (11.2 y. and 12.4 y. respectively). Only four buried CO groups (residues: 81, 175, 178 and 219) and two buried NH groups (145 and 221) seem to lack any hydrogen-bonding partners. A total of 39 CO (145%) groups are involved in hydrogen bonds with side-chain atoms; 61 (227%) are involved in double bifurcated hydrogen bonds and five (1.8%) seem to interact with three other donors (with water invariably involved in this category). Among the NH peptide groups 22 (8.2%) interact with side-chains, and only 10 (3.7%) seem to form bifurcated hydrogen bonds. All these numbers reflect the tendencies described by Baker & Hubbard (1984), although in RmL the percentage of peptide groups involved in multiple hydrogen bonds is lower than their results (24.5 o/b versus 34 o/o for CO groups and 37 y. versus 4.2 %, for NH groups). (iii)(b) Side-chain hydrogen bonding and salt bridges Table 4 lists all the hydrogen bonds and saltbridge type interactions between polar and charge residues. There are nine clusters of such residues. involving more than one interaction, and eight single pairs. Five interactions can be defined as salt bridges between charged side-chains, predominantly Arg with either Glu or Asp. A clear majority of these interactions are found on the surface of the protein with only three buried clusters and two buried single pairs (Glu221-Ser245, and Tyr28His143). Of the three buried clusters: one is the catalytic triad, and one is a three-residue cluster at the interface of the N-terminal helix with the /?-sheet (this constellation also includes 2 of the buried water molecules, see section (c), (ii)).

ester bond cleavage can be inferred. Our discussion focuses on the description of the stereochemistry of the RmL active site and its comparison to that found in serine proteinases. The catalytic center of the RmL lipase is made up of three elements: the Asp-His-Ser triad (structurally analogous to that found in serine proteinases), which is responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the ester carbonyl carbon atom, the oxyanion hole (also analogous to that of proteinases), which stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate, and the helical "lid", which appears to be unique to neutral lipases, and which is responsible for the interfacial activation upon adsorption of the enzyme to an oil-water interface. (iv)(a) The stereochemistry of the catalytic triad in RmL and its comparison to serine proteinuses The nucleophilic triad consists of Asp203, His257 and Ser144. All hydrogen bonds identified in this system are characteristic of this constellation in serine proteinases: N"*(His) is bonded to Or(Ser), while Nd' of the imidazol group is hydrogen bonded to one of the aspartic acid carboxyl oxygen atoms and in van der Waals' contact with the other (see Table 5). The coupling of Asp and His is ubiquitous in various families of enzymes, including enzymes, serine proteinases, esterases &-containing and several other hydrolases and oxidoreductases. The effect of this couple is to modify the nucleophilicity of a His-bound active group either directly (e.g. a serine hydroxyl group in serine proteinases, an -SH group of Cys in dienlactone hydrolase, or a water molecule in phospholipase A2) or indirectly, via an interaction with the His-bound Zn atom. The stereochemistry of the acid-His couple in RmL is quite typical. An aspartic acid residue (rather than Glu, as in AchE and GcL) provides stabilization for the imidazolium ion. O*' of Asp203 accepts a hydrogen bond from N" of His257 (this is a syn-type bond) and one from 0" of Tyr260 (anti). The stereochemistry of these two bonds is very favourable and indicates strong interactions. 06*, on the other hand, is within a close van der Waals' range of both N61 of His257 (302 A) and main-chain N of Va1205 (297 A). It is that second interaction, which is stereochemically favourable for a hydrogen bond; the 06*. . . H-NE2 (His257) interaction would imply an angle on the hydrogen atom of BO", much too acute for a proper hydrogen bond.

There is one close interaction (2.5 A) involving side-chain carboxyl groups of two acidic residues, Asp48 and Glu72. Such hydrogen bonds are rather rare but not unknown (i.e. in the center of the insulin hexamer, Glu B13 forms such a bond with its symmetry-related partner). The relatively low pH of the crystal may be responsible for the protonation of Glu72. (iv) The catalytic center In general, the diposition of residues that make up the active center in RmL is closely reminiscent of the active site of serine proteinases. This is not an unexpected result, given the similarities in the electronic structure of the amide and ester bonds, and the similar mechanisms of their hydrolysis. Serine proteinases have been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies, from which much about the possible mechanism. of enzymatic

Figure 10. The relative dispositions and hydrogen bonding of the His-Asp couple of the catalytic triad as observed in (a) RmL, (b) Str. griseus trypsin, and (c) subtilisin. This overall stereochemistry is very close to that found in the chymotrypsin family of proteinases (Fig. lo), where 06' also accepts a syn-type bond from NE2 of His57 and another from the hydroxyl group of Serl14. It is noteworthy that the carboxyl group is rotated with respect to the imidazol plane in a fashion remarkably similar to that found in RmL. It has been suggested (Gandour, 1981) that the syn-carboxylate group may be more basic than anti by a factor of lo3 to 104. This effect could, in turn, alter the basicity of the imidazole group and constitute one of the controlling mechanisms for the expression of catalytic activity. However, recent studies of databases (Allen & Kirby, 1991) and model compounds (Zimmerman et al., 1991) indicate that the difference in the relative basicities is at best marginal (0.4 to 0% pH unit). Moreover, the hPL triad and the active center of phospholipase A2 both contain Asp-His interactions of the anti-type. Thus, the preference towards syn-type bonds may be caused by the packing of residues in the active centers, rather than stereoelectronic effects.

Figure 11. The hydrophobic interface between the interfacial "lid" and the main domain of the RmL molecule. There are two subtle differences between the relative dispositions of Asp-His couples in RmL and the chymotrypsin family proteienases. First, in the chymotrypsin family, Serl14 (which is hydrogen bonded to the catalytic Asp) is much closer to the molecular surface than is the structurally analogous, completely buried Tyr260 in RmL. It has been proposed (Meyer et al., 1988) that Ser214 is essential for catalysis and may be involved in a network of flip-flop hydrogen bonds shuttling a proton from the reactive histidine. Recent mutagenesis studies (McGrath et al., 1992) show that, in trypsin, the removal of the hydroxyl group from Ser214 does not reduce activity on a tripeptide amide substrate. Accordingly, the role of the hydrogen bond between Ser214 and Asp102 is not critical. In RmL, Tyr260 donates a hydrogen bond to Asp203 O*' and accepts one from the main-chain amide group of Asn200. No further interactions are involved. Owing to the of His57 (with respect to different conformation trypsin) its backbone amide group is able to donate a hydrogen bond to Od2 of Asp203. In subtilisin, a representative of the second family of serine proteinases, the relative dispositions of Asp and His are in contrast to those described above (Fig. 10(c)). The plane of the carboxyl group of Asp is now rotated with respect to the imidazole group in a direction opposite to that observed in RmL and tr psin; Od' (which accepts a hydrogen bond from NZ of the catalytic His) is stabilized by an additional hydrogen bond donated by the main-chain amide group of Thr33. Thus, it is this interaction, and not that with Oy of Thr33, that constitutes the second important hydrogen bond in this system. In RmL, as in all serine proteinases, the Asp-His couple functions by enhancing the nucleophilicity of the reactive serine. Among the X-ray structures of most native proteinases (with a notable exception of cr-chymotrypsin) it was observed that the hydrogen bonds between the His Ne2 and Ser Oy is fairly long and, therefore, weak, (for a discussion of this, see Read & James, 1988). The observation originally lead Matthews et al. (1977) to question the existence of a hydrogen bond between the catalytic serine and the histidine in serine proteinases. However, more recent solution studies (Smith et al., 1989) indicate that protonation of the catalytic histidine residue may disturb the hydrogen-bonding network in crystals. In RmL, the stereochemistry of the sidechains of His257 and Ser144 favours the formation of a strong hydrogen bond with the donor-acceptor distance of 2.9 A, whatever the donor-acceptor relationship. A careful analysis of both donoracceptor alternatives (Table 5) suggests, however, that protonated imidazole forms a more favorable interaction. This is consistent with the observed acidic pH in the RmL crystallization setup of 3.9 to 4-o. (iv)(b) The oxpnion hole All serine proteinases contain an oxyanion hole, generally made up of two main-chain amide hydrogen atoms, the purpose of which is to stabilize the tetrahedral intermediates that occur during both the acylation and the deacylation steps (Kraut, 1977). In the native RmL molecule, two amide groups (residues 142 and 143) were proposed as likely candidates for this function (Brady et al., 1990). However, structural analyses of the inhibited complexes (Brzozowski et al., 1991); Derewenda et al,, 1992) revealed that the oxyanion hole is actually formed during the conformational change and that it is made up of both the amide and the side-chain hydroxyl groups of Ser82. A high-resolution study of a lipase molecule in its "active" conformation is therefore required to elucidate the details of the stereochemistry of the oxylation hole. (iv)(c) The lid The catalytic triad in RmL is not exposed to solvent, but is instead buried under a short surface helix (residues 85 to 91) which has been referred to as the lid. The displacement of this element was postulated as the likely structural basis of the interfacial activation of this family of lipases (Brady et al., 1990). This was subsequently proved experiof RmL with when a complex mentally n-hexylphosphonate ethyl ester inhibitor was characterized by X-ray diffraction at 3.0 A resolution (Brzozowski et al., 1991) and the details of the conformational changes observed upon activation were described at 2.6 A resolution for the p-nitro-

phenylphosphate-inhibited enzyme (Derewenda et al., 1992). In the native molecule the lid occupies a depression to the side of the catalytic center. It is notable that between Arg80 and Va195 this fragment is not involved in any hydrogen bonds with any other parts of the molecule (there are only several water bridges). Thus, the lid interacts with the main body interof the protein only through hydrophobic actions (Fig. 11). The most recent study of the inhibited molecule (Derewenda et al., 1992) shows that, upon activation, the RmL molecule actually gains hydrogen bonds formed between the sidechain of Asn87 (part of the lid) and Tyr60 with Asp61 on the part of the "main" domain. (c) &?Avent structure (i) General description In total, 230 water molecules have been identified, based on the presence of positive difference electron density and the potential hydrogenbonding geometry. Of these, 197 (86%) water molecules are hydrogen bonded directly to the protein: 14 molecules form four hydrogen bonds to protein atoms and their mean isotropic temperature factor is 245 A', reflecting, as expected, the reduced mobility. A total of 27 water molecules make three hydrogen bonds (mean value of B = 29.8 A2), 52 form two hydrogen bonds (mean value of B = 37.3 A*), and 104 from only one hydrogen bond to the protein (mean value of B = 456 A2). Of the remaining 33 water molecules, 30 are hydrogen bonded to other water molecules, while three are not within 3.4 A of any other atom. These molecules are all characterized by diffuse electron density and high temperature factors. A vast majority of water molecules cluster around the polar and charged surface residues forming an intricate hydrogen-bond network interconnecting individual residues and their clusters. A large proportion are associated with polar clusters and are listed in Table 4. Such distribution is characteristic for globular proteins, as is the tendency for non-bonded peptide amide and carbonyl groups to be solvated. In RmL, in addition to these typical features, we find internal water molecules enclosed within the interior of the protein, and a deep water-filled depression adjacent to the lid, which provides the latter with an alternative space when it changes its conformation upon the activation of the enzyme. (ii) The location of internal water molecules and its implications for molecular folding Many proteins contain internal water molecules, strongly bound to polar side-chains and/or mainchain peptides. These molecules most likely become trapped during the folding process and become a part of the protein molecular architecture. Recent high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that they are in identical locations in the crystal structure and in solution. Their residence times (10e2 to lo-' s) are considerably longer than those of the water molecules hydrating the surface

In this paper we address only some of the issues. Extensive characterization of the surface of the RmL molecule is at present under way. There are a number of strictly internal water molecules in RmL, i.e. concealed under main-chain loops rather than side-chains only (Table 6). The largest cluster (made up of 7 molecules) occurs on the proximal side of the central B-sheet, just under the C-terminal segments of the polypeptide chain formed by the b-strand 8, the following turn and the C-terminal oligopeptide (residues 231 onwards). The general location of this hydrophilic cavity is shown in Figure 12(a). The water molecules are clustered in three groups of two molecules each and one single molecule. Figure 12(b) shows the resulting hydrogen-bonding-network within the cavity. Water molecules, marked 5W and 6W in Figure 13(a), form a cluster found at the center of the interface formed by the distal side of the P-sheet and the N-terminal helix. The stereochemistry of the neighbouring electronegative atoms allowed for an unambiguous assignment of hydrogen atoms (Table 6). Water 91W, situated at the C-terminal end of the same helix is also a part of the interface. Water 264W (Fig. 13(b)) is buried under the long loop between the N-terminal helix and the first strand of the p-sheet (residues 27 to 49). It is unique in that it is stabilized by a rarely observed hydrogen bond to the sulfur atom of Met65. An exchange of any of these water molecules most likely requires partial unfolding of the protein. In one case, this would involve local "melting" within the C-terminal segment, in the other a

temporary dissociation of the N-terminal a-helix from the p-sheet. Interestingly, the distribution of four cis-proline residues found in RmL (34, 206,209, 250) is in agreement with these folding intermediates inferred from the localization of buried solvent molecules. It is widely recognized that the isomerization of proline imide bonds generates slow folding phases. The pentapeptide 206-210 (which is at the beginning of the C-terminal segment covering the `I-molecule water cluster) must therefore present a considerable energy barrier, as three of its residues are proline 206, 209 and 210). In a similar way, Pro34 may create a rate-limiting step between a relatively rigid loop containing the disulfide bond 40-43 and the N-terminal helix, which is likely to fold early on. Recent experimental evidence clearly points to the existence of folding intermediates, in which some secondary structure elements occur prior to the final tertiary fold. The distribution of buried

water molecules along with the locat,ion of proline residues and disulfide bridges seems to suggest that strands 1 to 6 with the interconnecting loops may fold first with the C terminus following in a slow phase and N-terminal helix docking onto this completed sheet allowing residues 5 to 8 to bind in an antiparallel fashion to strand 8. Water 27W occupies the substrate-binding site, or more precisely the oxyanion hole. It' donates a proton to the active serine hydroxyl oxygen atom and accepts two hydrogen bonds from the mainchain amide groups of Ser82 and Leu145. It is buried primarily by the residues within the lid, and the residence time of this molecule is likely to be controlled by the dynamics of lid opening and closure. (iii) The hydrophilic depression adjacent to the lid The surface of a globular protein is frequently characterized by shallow depressions occupied by

In RmL, one such feature is of particular interest, as it seems to be the alternative position for the catalytic lid, when the enzyme is in its active, open conformation. Three different fragments of the polypeptide chain surround this depression: residue 59 to 61 (part of the turn connecting antiparallel strands 1 and 2), The N-terminal end of helix 3 (residues 108 to 113) and the polar side of the lid. One of the surface salt bridges (AspGl-Arg80) is at the periphery of this cavity. The bottom of the cleft, which is N 13 A deep, is lined with polar residues: Thr149 (at the deepest point), Thr62, Serll4, Ser82 and His108 N" of Trp88 also points towards this cavity and is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule. There are 12 water molecules bonded directly to protein atoms, and 13 in the secondary shell, for which density is interpretable. There is residual density indicating that even more solvent molecules are bound close to this area, albeit with much higher temperature factors, and/or only partial occupancy. Recent studies of the inhibited forms of the R. miehei lipase (Brzozowski et al., 1991; Derewenda et al., 1992) confirmed that the cavity serves as an alternate location for the lid in the activated species. (d) Crystal
contacts

numbers of ordered solvent molecules forming a hydrogen-bonding network between the protein molecules. In fact, the fifth crystal contact has no direct interactions, but is instead exclusively engineered by a network of water molecules. In one case a clear interaction of hydrophobic nature between the side-chain of Phe251 and Pro101 contributes to the interaction. Using only co-ordinates from a single crystal form, it is not possible to assess the extent of the possible conformational strain imposed by the crystal contacts. Some of the interactions involve the loop around the point of entry to the catalytic center, and it is important to evaluate the possible influence of crystal packing on these structural elements. Since the native structure described in this paper was solved, a different crystal form (space group C222,, a = 4fQ3 & b = 93.9 A, c = 122 A) was obtained when the enzyme was inhibited by either n-hexylphosphonate ethylester (Brzozowski et al., 1991) or p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Derewenda et al., 1992). A comparison of the two structures (our Table 7
Direct hydrogen bonds between symmetry-related molecules

There are four direct crystal contacts between the RmL molecule and five of its neighbors (Fig. 14). In addition, there is one indirect contact mediated exclusively by a network of water molecules. The details of all direct side-chain-side-chain and side-chain-main-chain interactions are given in Table 7. All of the contacts are predominantly polar with two salt bridges (Glu47-Arg86 and Glu61Arg30). Three main-chain carbonyl groups (those of Cys40, Ala90 and ProlOO) are involved in hydrogen bonds with the side-chains of symmetry-related molecules. In all cases we observe significant

We conclude that the crystal structure of RmL is not distorted by crystal packing and is very close to the structure of this molecule in solution.

4. Conclusion
The Rhizomucor miehei triglyceride lipase was one of the first lipases to be studied by X-ray crystallography, and is the only one for which a structural description of both the native and the "activated" states is available. Although the protein must be stable in both polar and non-polar environments and undergo specific structural changes in moving from one to the other, the molecule conforms to the well-established rules of protein stereochemistry. The simple, singly wound P-sheet may be seen as a rather ancient fold, but it shares significant common features with other lipades and esterases. The catalytic center formed by the triad of Ser144, His257 and Asp203 is likely to have evolved independently from the two structural characterized families of serine proteinases. However, evolutionary relationships with other proteinases, and in particular with the prolyl peptidase family (Rawlings et al., 1991) cannot be ruled out. Perhaps the most fascinating element in the molecule of RmL is the lid. This structure apparently evolved to allow the enzyme to cope with the insoluble lipids at the very interface. The structure of hPL (Winkler et al., 1990) strongly suggests that a similar mechanism may be involved in the human enzyme, whereas, sequence homology studies (Derewenda $ Cambillau, 1991) indicate that the lid may be a common feature among the whole family (including lipoprotein and hepatic lipases) and that it may also be involved in the regulation of these enzymes at the molecular level by co-factors. The results of Vrielink e2 al. (1991) also show that in bacterial cholesterol oxidase, another lipid metabolizing enzyme, a conformational change involving a displacement of a surface loop accompanies the binding of a steroid. Clearly, we observe, yet again, the ability of evolution to select simple and effective ways of solving complicated chemical problems.
