Abstract Human KIN17 is a 45-kDa eukaryotic DNA- and RNA-binding protein that plays an important role in nuclear metabolism and in particular in the general response to genotoxics. Its amino acids sequence contains a zinc finger motif (residues 28­50) within a 30-kDa N-terminal region conserved from yeast to human, and a 15-kDa C-terminal tandem of SH3-like subdomains (residues 268­393) only found in higher eukaryotes. Here we report the solution structure of the region 51­160 of human KIN17. We show that this fragment folds into a three-a-helix bundle packed against a three-stranded b-sheet. It belongs to the winged helix (WH) family. Structural comparison with analogous WH domains reveals that KIN17 WH module presents an additional and highly conserved 310-helix. Moreover, KIN17 WH helix H3 is not positively charged as in classical DNA-binding WH domains. Thus, human KIN17 region 51­160 might rather be involved in protein­protein interaction through its conserved surface centered on the 310-helix.

Maintenance of the genomic integrity is crucial for all living organisms. Since cells are continuously submitted to genotoxic stresses that induce DNA damages, they have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to detect, signal the presence of, and repair these lesions. In humans, the nucleotide excision repair pathway is an efficient way to remove DNA lesions induced by UV or ionizing radiation. The human gene KIN17, located in chromosome 10, participates in the general response to genotoxics. It is up-regulated following DNA damages produced by UV

or g irradiation, and this response is strictly dependent on the presence of nucleotide excision repair proteins XPA and XPC (Masson et al. 2003). The KIN17 gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that forms intranuclear foci in proliferating cells (Biard et al. 2002). Major features of the mammalian KIN17 protein are its ability to bind DNA and RNA in vitro and in vivo, to associate with multiprotein DNA replication complexes, and, when overexpressed, to inhibit the S-phase progression of the replication process (for review, see Angulo et al. 2005). Furthermore, the mouse KIN17 protein binds preferentially to curved DNA found at hot spots of illegitimate recombination in eukaryotic chromosomes (Mazin et al. 1994a). Taken together, these observations clearly indicate that KIN17 plays an important role in nuclear metabolism.

Solution structure of human KIN17 region 51­160

Human KIN17 is a 45-kDa modular protein composed of a 30-kDa N-terminal region conserved from yeast to human, and a 15-kDa tail found only in higher eukaryotes. The recently solved crystal structure of its C-terminal domain (residues 268­393) reveals a tandem of SH3-like subdomain that contributes to RNA-binding of the whole protein (le Maire et al. 2006). Deletion of this C-terminal domain does not affect the DNA binding of KIN17 (Mazin et al. 1994b). The N-terminal region comprises a C2H2 zinc finger motif (residues 28­50), which exhibits DNA- and RNA-binding properties (Mazin et al. 1994b; le Maire et al. 2006), and a globular domain (residues 51­160) of unknown function. Interestingly, if deletion of the zinc finger motif reduces KIN17 DNA binding, the core of the protein (residues 71­281) which comprises the globular region 51­160, still binds DNA (Mazin et al. 1994b). Here, we report the high-resolution NMR structure of human KIN17 region 51­160 as an important step toward identifying the structural and biological functions of this domain. Results and Discussion Structure determination The three-dimensional structure of human KIN17 region 51­160 was characterized using heteronuclear NMR and molecular modeling. As reported previously (Carlier et al. 2006), 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift assignments were completed for 95% of the backbone atoms and 90% of the side-chain resonances (BMRB accession number 6938). The solution structure was calculated using 2743 NOESY-derived proton­proton distances, 18 hydrogen bonds, and 140 f and c torsion angle values. Table 1 summarizes the structural statistics for the ensemble of the 12 best conformers that represent the solution structure of human KIN17 region 51­160. Analysis of this final ensemble shows that no distance violations larger than ° 0.5 A are present and that the covalent geometry is respected. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the RSCB Protein Data Bank under accession number 2V1N. Structure description A backbone superposition of the 12 best conformers is shown in Figure 1A as a stereo diagram. The first 14 N-terminal residues and the five last C-terminal amino acids (residues 51­64 and 156­160, respectively) are disordered, whereas fragment 65­155 adopts a welldefined a/b fold. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculated from the mean structure between ° residues 65 and 155 yields 0.43 A for the backbone and ° 1.03 A for the heavy atoms. The three-dimensional structure is constituted of four a-helices, H1 (residues 65­83), H2 (residues 91­99), H3 (residues 115­124), and H4 (residues 147­155); three b-strands, S1 (residues 88­90),

S2 (residues 128­133), and S3 (residues 136­141); and one 310-helix, H2.5 (residues 107­109), organized into an H1-S1-H2-H2.5-H3-S2-S3-H4 topology. Thus, the amino-terminal half of the domain is mainly a-helical, whereas the carboxyl-terminal half is dominated by two b-strands arranged in a twisted antiparallel b-sheet (Fig. 1B). The a-helices H1, H2, and H3 form a central orthogonal bundle. They are amphipathic, and their hydrophobic core is constituted by Met-65, Phe-72, Phe-76, Leu-77, Leu-79, Leu-80 (H1), Val-94, Tyr-95, Tyr-98 (H2), Leu115, Phe-118, Trp-121, and Leu-122 (H3). The threestranded b-sheet is packed onto the three-helix bundle via a hydrophobic interface in which Phe-76, Leu-77, Leu-80 (H1), Leu-115, Thr-119, Leu-122, and Gly-123 (H3) contact the hydrophobic b-sheet face composed of Cys128, Val-130 (S2), Trp-137, Ile-139, and Tyr-141 (S3). The three-amino-acid 310-helix H2.5 is located in a highly conserved long loop (residues 100­114) that connects a-helices H2 and H3 (Figs. 1B, 2A). The presence of such a short 310-helix in the unstructured region H2­ H3 is supported by unambiguous assignment of several interresidue 1H-1H nOes, in particular two consecutive daN(i,i + 2) and one daN(i,i + 3) connectivities that involve residues 107­110 (Supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, f and c dihedral restraints obtained for Met107 and Asn-108 from TALOS prediction are consistent with a 310-helix conformation (Supplemental Table S1). In the NMR structures, the 310-helix H2.5 is stabilized by

a canonical hydrogen bond between Ala-109 and His-106 and by a hydrogen bond network that involves the backbone of Trp-112, the backbone of Met-107, and the side chain of Thr-110. Such a network is confirmed by the observation of the hydroxyl group resonance of Thr-110 at a typical chemical shift (5.60 ppm) in the 15N-HSQCNOESY spectra. The side chains of Ile-105, Met-107,

Thr-110, and Trp-112 make numerous van der Waals interactions with Phe-72 (H1), Leu-115, and Phe-118 (H3), and thus pack the 310-helix onto the central orthogonal bundle. A 15N-1H heteronuclear nOe experiment was performed in order to investigate the backbone flexibility. Figure 2B shows the values of 1H ! 15N nOe, which is essentially

sensitive to rapid motions (i.e., picosecond to nanosecond timescale), as a function of residue number. Negative and small values (<0.25) are observed for the extremities 52­60 and 157­160, confirming the mobility of the N- and Cterminal parts of the domain. Intermediate values (between 0.35 and 0.6) are found for the C-terminal region 144­156, indicating partially restricted motions in the helical region H4. Consistently, only a small number of medium- and long-range 1H-1H nOes were unambiguously assigned to residues 52­60 and 144­160 (Supplemental Fig. S1). Finally, almost all residues belonging to the three-helix bundle, the antiparallel b-sheet, and the long loop H2­H3 (i.e., from Met-65 to Asp-143) display a 1H ! 15N nOe value close to 0.8 characteristic of highly restricted rapid motions. This last region adopts a stable conformation on the picosecond to nanosecond timescale. Region 51­160 of human KIN17 adopts a winged helix fold The three-dimensional structure of human KIN17 fragment 65­155 was submitted to the DALI server (www.ebi.ac.uk/ dali/). It is close to the three-dimensional structure of numerous proteins belonging to the winged helix family (WH), which is a member of the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix superfamily (Gajiwala and Burley 2000). The WH motif is a compact a/b fold consisting of three a-helices (H1, H2, and H3), three b-strands (S1, S2, and S3), and two loops called wings W1 and W2, organized in an H1-S1-H2-H3S2-W1-S3-W2 topology. The WH domain of human KIN17 is very close to the canonical topology. The only difference occurs at the level of the H2­H3 loop, where an atypical well-defined 310-helix is observed. Analysis of the phylogenetic conservation of human KIN17 region 51­160 was achieved using the PSI-blast server (www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/BLAST/). Figure 2A shows that this region is particularly well conserved from yeast to human. Most residues from the hydrophobic core of the domain are conserved (31% sequence identity and 77% sequence similarity over 14 residues), as well as 8 of the 15 amino acids belonging to the long loop H2­H3. Such analysis suggests that all eukaryotic KIN17 proteins share a common WH domain at their amino-terminal region that is structurally similar to the human KIN17 region 51­160. Possible functions of the human KIN17 winged helix domain The WH module is mainly known for its ability to interact with nucleic acids and in particular with DNA. Interestingly, the DALI tool shows that human KIN17 region 51­160 displays structural analogy with the DNA-binding WH domain of BlaI (PDB code 1XSD, Z-score 5.1, sequence identity 13%), MecI (1OKR, Z-score 5.0, sequence identity

9%), and DP2 (1CF7, Z-score 4.8, sequence identity 16%), whose structures in complex with a DNA fragment have been solved by crystallography (Zheng et al. 1999; GarciaCastellanos et al. 2004; Safo et al. 2005). In these structures, the recognition helix H3 penetrates DNA major groove to make base-specific contacts while the wing W1 interacts with the phosphodiester backbone of the minor groove to increase the binding affinity. This DNA recognition mode is typical of WH proteins (Gajiwala and Burley 2000). Superposition of the KIN17 WH domain onto the WH­DNA complex of BlaI, MecI, and DP2 reveals a remarkable structural similarity despite a low level of sequence identity (Supplemental Fig. S2). However, significant differences are observed in the region comprising the recognition helix H3 and the loop H2­H3. In KIN17, loop H2­H3 is longer by at least seven residues whereas helix H3 is about five amino acids shorter. Moreover, the presence of the additional 310-helix H2.5 in KIN17 loop H2­H3 results in a substantially different positioning of the recognition helix H3 that does not superimpose on that of BlaI, MecI, and DP2. Comparison of the electrostatic potential surfaces also shows structural differences between the WH domain of KIN17 and the DNA-binding WH proteins (Fig. 3A). In all the structures of WH­DNA complexes, basic residues belonging to helice H3 and/or wing W1 form a concave positively charged surface that is generally well conserved. In the case of KIN17, the corresponding surface is rather slightly negative. Moreover, analysis of a sequence alignment of 20 KIN17 proteins using the program ConSurf reveals that the conservation of this surface is not significant (consurf.tau.ac.il/). Considering these observations, we were convinced that the WH domain of KIN17 does not interact with DNA through the typical recognition mode of WH proteins. Southwestern blotting studies were further performed using different KIN17 fragments but no interaction was observed between the recombinant domain 51­160 and a double-stranded DNA fragment recognized in vivo and in vitro by the whole protein (data not shown). Interestingly, three residues of helix H2 (Asn-92, Glu97, and Ile-99) and five residues of loop H2­H3 (His-104, His-106, Asn-108, Ala-109, and Thr-114) constitute a highly conserved and neutral surface located on a face opposite to the H3­W1 face (Fig. 3B). This surface could be involved in protein­protein interactions as observed in the recently published structure of the RAP74­FCP1 complex, in which the WH domain of RAP74 uses its neutral H2­H3 surface to bind the FCP1 peptide (Nguyen et al. 2003). Since the KIN17 WH module (residues 65­ 143) is close to a zinc finger motif (residues 28­50), its conserved surface could also participate with intramolecular interactions with this zinc finger domain. Structural investigation of intramolecular domain interactions will now be carried out in order to provide additional clues on the function of KIN17 WH module.

Materials and Methods Sample preparation
Region 51­160 of human KIN17 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta DE3 transformed with a construct generated in pEXP-TH5 plasmid (Invitrogen). This vector encodes a 6xHis-tag, the Z-domain from Staphylococcal Protein A (ZZ), a TEV protease (Tobacco Etch Virus) cleavage site, and the KIN17 region. The recombinant protein was prepared from cells grown to an OD595 nm of 1.2 at 37°C in a bacterial culture supplemented by 100 mg/mL ampicillin and 35 mg/mL chloramphenicol. Protein expression was then induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and culture was further grown for 14 h at 20°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF), and lysed with an Eaton press (Rassant). The fusion protein was purified using IgG Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham) and digested on-column with recombinant (His)6TEV protease. The cleaved KIN17 domain was further purified on nickel-nitriloacetic acid resin with a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) to remove the (His)6-TEV protease as well as the residual (His)6-ZZ fragment. Because of the cloning strategy, the protein resulting from the cleavage contains the region 51­ 160 of human KIN17 plus an additional glycine residue at the N terminus. Uniformly labeled 15N protein was produced in minimum medium M9 containing 1 g.LÀ1 of (15NH4)2SO4 (Boehringer) as the sole nitrogen source. Uniformly labeled 13 15 C/ N protein was produced in a rich medium prepared from uniformly labeled 13C/15N Spirulina maxima cyanobacteria. The resulting protein was characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. NMR samples (;0.7 mM) were prepared in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mM NaN3 in either 90% H2O/10% D2O or in 100% D2O. 3-(Trimethylsilyl)[2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate (TSP) was added as an internal 1H chemical shift reference. 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to TSP, using the absolute frequency ratios.

NMR spectroscopy and structure calculation
All NMR experiments were performed at 30°C on Bruker AVANCE DMX-600 or VARIAN INOVA-800 spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe. 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignment of human KIN17 region 51­160 has been described previously (Carlier et al. 2006). A 15N-1H heteronuclear nOe experiment was carried out at 600 MHz using the classical pulse program (Farrow et al. 1994). Two spectra were acquired in an interleaved fashion with and without saturation (5s), respectively. Uncertainty in the 1H ! 15N nOe values were calculated from the peak intensity errors estimated from the root mean square baseline noise of both spectra. The 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effect cross-peak volumes used for structure calculation were measured on three NOESY experiments (a 15N-HSQC-NOESY in H2O with a 80-ms mixing time and a 13 C-HSQC-NOESY in D2O with a 100-ms mixing time recorded at 800 MHz, and a 13C-HSQC-NOESY in the 13C aromatic region recorded at 600 MHz with a 120-ms mixing time). f and c torsion angle values were deduced either from the backbone chemical shifts using the program TALOS (Cornilescu et al. 1999) or from the analysis of the HNHA and HMQC-J experiments. Hydrogen-bound restraints were derived from slowly exchanging amide protons, identified by measuring the amide proton exchange rates from 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded at different times on a protein sample dissolved in D2O (Supplemental Table S2). Oxygen atoms involved in hydrogen-bond restraints were deduced from the secondary structure determined by the TALOS program and from the b-sheet topology. All spectra were processed with the programs Xwinnmr (Bruker) or NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995) and analyzed using Felix (Accelrys). The solution structure of human KIN17 region 51­160 was solved on the basis of the analysis of 3413 nOe cross-peaks (1466 were picked on the 15N-HSQC-NOESY, 1919 on the aliphatic 13C-HSQC-NOESY, and 28 on the aromatic 13 C-HSQC-NOESY, respectively). The semiautomated iterative assignment procedure INCA was applied for nOe assignment and three-dimensional structure construction (Savarin et al. 2001). Structures were calculated using a simulated annealing protocol in CNS 1.0 (Brunger et al. 1998). At the last step, 400 structures were generated using a total of 2743 distance

restraints, 18 hydrogen bonds, 136 f and c torsion angle values obtained from TALOS prediction, and 4 f angle values deduced from HNHA and HMQC-J experiments. The 12 best structures were selected and refined with a standard energy function (CHARMM22), including an electrostatic energy term. This term was calculated with no net charge on the side-chain atoms and with a distance-gated dielectric constant
