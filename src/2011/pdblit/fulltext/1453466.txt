The crystal structure of thioredoxin from Es&erichia coli has been refined by the stereochemically restrained least-squares procedure to a crystallographic R-facdor of 0.165 at 1.68 a resolution. In the final model, the root-mean-square deviation from ideality folr bond distances is 0.015 a and for angle distances 0.035 8. The structure contains 1644 protein atoms from two independent molecules, two Cu `+ 140 water molecules and seven Ten residues have bee; modeled in two alternative methylpentanediol molecules. conformations. E. coli thioredoxin is a compact molecule with 90% of its residues in helices, P-strands or reverse turns. The molecule consists of two conformational domains, PC&/~ and ~/LX, connected by a single-turn a-helix and a 310 helix. The p-sheet forms the core of the molecule packed on either side by clusters of hydrophobic residues. Helices form t,he external surface. The active site disulfide bridge between Cys32 and Cys3.5 is located at the amino terminus of the second a-helix. The positive electrostatic field due to the helical dipole is probably important for stabilizing the anionic intermediate during the disulfide reduct,ase function of the protein, The more reactive cysteine, Cys32, has its sulfur atom exposed to solvent and also involved in a hydrogen bond with a backbone amide group. Residues 29 to 37, which include the active site cysteine residues, form a protrusion on the surface of the protein and make relatively fewer interactions with the rest of the structure. The disulfide bridge exhibits a right-handed conformation with a torsion angle of 81" and 72" about the Twenty-five pairs of water molecules obey the nonS-S bond in the two molecules. crystallographic symmetry. Most of them are involved in establishing intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions between protein atoms and thus serve as integral parts of the folded protein structure. Methylpentanediol molecules often pack against the loops and stabilize their structure. Cu2+ used for crystallization exbibit a distorted octahedral square bipyramid co-ordination and provide essential packing interactions in the crystal. The two independent protein molecules are very similar in conformation but distinctly different, in atomic detail (root-mean-square=094 8). The differences, which may be related to the crystal contacts, are localized mostly to regions far from the active site.

protein is characterized by an act'ive site containing two cysteine residues separated by two other residues. The reversible oxidation of t'hese cysteine residues to the disulfide form serves as a rledox couple for a number of biological reactions.

et al. proteins characterized by a common fold (Hiiog et al., 1983). LeMaster & Richards (1988) have carried out the main-chain sequential resonance assignment of the oxidized E. coli thioredoxin using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.t) techniques. Side-chain conformations of a number of residues have also been determined using samples containing chirally deuterated amino acids (LeMaster, 1987). More recently, detailed analyses of the n.m.r. spectra of both the reduced and the oxidized forms have been completed by Dyson et al. (I 989). Structural results obtained by X-ray and n.m.r. methods are in good agreement. In order to study the structure in greater detail we have now extended the resolution of the X-ray analysis of the oxidized form of E. coli protein to l-68 A and report here the details of this investigation. 2.

inorganic sulfate (Wilson et ai., 1961). It was then found to participate along with ribonucleotide reductase in the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (Laurent et al., 1964; Engstrom et al., 1974). Mutation analysis demonstrated that the reduced Escherichia coli thioredoxin is required for bacteriophage T7 replication, where it serves as a subunit of the DNA polymerase (Mark & Richardson, 1976) and also for the assembly of filamentous phages (Russel & Model, 1984). In plants the protein regulates the activity of various photosynthetic enzymes (Buchanan, 1980). E. coli mutants lacking any detectable thioredoxin protein were found not to be auxotrophic for reduced sulfur compounds or deoxyribose derivatives and this led to the discovery of the complementary glutaredoxin reduction system (Holmgren, 1976). Thioredoxin from E. coli has been studied extensively using biochemical, spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction techniques (note Holmgren et al., 1986). The protein (11,675 JJ,) consists of a single polypeptide chain of 108 amino acid residues of known sequence (Holmgren, 1968). The protein has been cloned and expressed (Wallace & Kushner, 1984). Several variants have been isolated by spontaneous and site-directed mutations to investigate the enzymatic and redox properties (Holmgren et al., 1981), folding kinetics (Kelley & Richards, 1987) and its role in filamentous phage assembly (Russel & Model, 1984). The oxidized form (thioredoxin-Sz) is reduced (thioredoxin-(SH),) by thioredoxin reductase in the presence of the cofactor NADPH (Moore et al., 1964), although mutational analyses indicate that other reductants may function in viva (Holmgren, 1979). The proposed mechanism of action of thioredoxin involves initial nucleophilic attack by the more reactive thiol group (Cys32) on one of the sulfur atoms in the substrate, yielding an unstable transient mixed disulfide. The second thiol group (Cys35) then displaces the sulfur atom of the substrate to generate thioredoxinG$ and in the process reduces the substrate (Kallis & Holmgren, 1980). The conversion between the oxidized and the reduced forms is accompanied by a change in conformation that is reflected in the fluorescence properties of Trp28 (Holmgren, 1972). The three-dimensional structure of the oxidized form was determined earlier by single-crystal X-ray crystallography at 2.8 A resolution (Holmgren et al., 1975). The protein forms a core of twisted P-sheet flanked on either side by helices. A similar fold has been observed in the structure of thioredoxin from phage T4 (Sijderberg et al., 1978), despite substantial differences in the primary structure. Eklund et al. (1984) have modeled glutaredoxin from E. coli in a similar tertiary fold by correlating sequence homologies and the structurally invariant features observed in the experimentally determined thioredoxin structures. It has been proposed that the functionally related thioredoxins and glutaredoxins belong to a super-family of cysteine-hydrogen-donor

(a) Crystallization E. coli thioredoxin was obtained by the methods described by LeMaster & Richards (1988). The protein was crystallized according to the procedure reported earlier (Holmgren & Siiderberg, 1970), but on a larger scale, by equilibrium dialysis against 40% (v/v) Z-methyl2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 001 iv-sodium acetate buffer at pH 3.8 in the presence of 1 mm-cupric acetate at 4°C. The bluish rhombohedral crystals belong to the space-group 62 with unit cell dimensions a=89.50, b=51.06, c = 60.45 ,&, and p = 1135", with 2 molecules~asymmetrie unit; exactly the same form as studied earlier (Holmgren et al., 1975). The crystals diffract to better than 1~7i% resolution. They are stable for days at room temperature, thus obviating the need to collect data at 4"C, as in the earlier X-ray analysis. (b) Data collection The dataset to 2.5 a used in the earlier stages of refinement was collected on a STOE 4-circle diffractometer. The high-resolution X-ray intensity data were collected on a UCSD Mark 11 multiwire dual area detector system using a crystal of size 0.6 mm x 96 mm x 0.4 mm with a rotating anode source. "Electronic Rotation Method" (Xuong et al., 1978) was employed by rotating the cryst.ai about the w-axis by 0.1" frames in steps of 0~01" and counting each frame for 15 s. Using I crystal, a total of 218,249 reflections were recorded of which 27,913 were unique in giving an average redundancy factor of 7.8/ reflection. The dataset is complete up to 1.8 a (I .&=O.I nm) and 87% between 1.8 to 1.68 a. The average I/a(l) is greater than 2 at 1.7 a and falls off to 1.6 in the outermost shell. The raw data were processed using the software package as of 1987, provided to the Yale by San Diego Multiwire Systems.

(c) Refinement (i) Starling
model The original m.i.r. electron density map from 2 derivatives was poor at several places. A model could be built using Richards box (Richards, 1968) after averaging the (Holmgren et al., 1975). It was map over the 2 subunits then improved using FRODO (Jones, 1978) on a Vector General 3404 graphics system and a map (Eklund et al., 1984) that had been averaged by applying the non-crystallographic translational symmetry in reciprocal space (Agard & Stroud, 1982). This served as the starting model for the crystallographic refinement. (ii) Major corrections of the model Initially the structure was refined at 2.8 d resolution using CORELS (Sussman et al., 1977) and subsequently at 2.5a using PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1981) against the dataset collected on the diffractometer. The successive maps showed some of the uncertain parts that were mainly localized to the amino terminal 20 residues of both the molecules. The residues in the 1st strand were 1 position towards the amino end and the subshifted sequent connection between the 1st strand and the 1st helix became 1 residue shorter, as also noted independently by n.m.r. analysis (LeMaster & Richards, 1988). Two errors in the amino acid sequence were corrected after the DNA sequence became available (Wallace & Kushner, 1984; H6;6g et al., 1984). Leu-Val at position 1617 was changed to Val-Leu and Ile-Gly at position 71-72 to Gly-Ile. (iii) Least squares rejnemenl The final refinement was carried out against the area detector dataset by the stereochemically restrained leastsquares procedure (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1981) using the programs PROTIN/PROFFT (Finzel, 1987). This package contains routines that handle discretely disordered side-chains (Smith et al., 1986) and symmetryrelated contacts (Sheriff, 1987). The weighting parameters for the various stereochemical restraints were those suggested by Hendrickson (1985). Fourier (Eb - rc), (2F, - E",) (where F, is the observed and F, the calculated structure factor) and omit maps were used during the course of the refinement. The first 2 were computed using phases calculated from the model and F0 - Fc and 2F, - F, as coefficients, respectively. In the OMITMAP program written by S. Katti, electron density for the model is generated from the atomic positions using Ten Eyck's (1973) formalism. One-tenth of the unit cell is flattened and phases calculated and used to compute the ZFO- F, map in this portion. In the next cycle, flattening is performed in a different portion and the procedure repeated to complete the map in the desired region of the unit cell. Fast-Fourier transform routines of the program CHAFF (Bantz & Zwick, 1974), kindly provided by E. Westbrook, are utilized in both the density and phase calculation steps.

There are 2 copper and 6 sulfur atoms in the asymmetric unit. Corrections for their anomalous scattering effects were included. Near the end of the refinement, after holes were noticed at copper atom positions, the SCATT routine (Finzel, 1987) of the programs was modified to include the real part of the dispersion correction for copper cf'= -2.1) (Dauben & Templeton, 1962) and this appeared to improve the maps subsequently. Refinement was initiated with 8696 reflections between 5 and 2.4 il. Data in the higher as well as lower-resolution shells were added gradually to finally span the range the F, between 8 and 1.68 8. After cycle 52, Rt=0.220, values were scaled locally with respect to rc in the 5 to 1.68 A resolution range to correct for any systematic discrepancies between them. Decay corrections are not applied explicitly during data processing (Howard et aZ., 1985), which could lead to a systematic fall off at higher resolution. A scaling parameter was calculated for each reflection using 75 nearest neighbors in a box of 5 x 3 x 5 indices around that reflection. The locally scaled F, data brought the R-factor down by 0.5 %. We continued the refinement with this dataset. Solvent molecules were picked automatically from a list of peaks in difference map using the program SOLVENT developed by S. Katti. The program selects a peak as a "possible" solvent molecule if: (1) it meets hydrogenwith respect to hydrogen bond bonding distance criterion forming protein atoms, i.e. N, 0 or other solvent molecules (2,5<d <3.3 8); and (2) it does not form bad contacts ( <3% 8) with any other part of the structure. All calculations are done in the asymmetric unit and then the selected peak is transformed to be placed next to the interacting protein atom in the model. The "possible" solvent molecule was accepted for the next cycle of refinemap. Positivle peaks ment if also found in the (2F,-F,) with height greater than 3.0 times the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) value in the difference map were checked systematically using this program. The newly identified water molecules were assigned an occupancy of I.0 ,and an t'emperature factor B of 20 ip'. Tlhe 1st search isotropic was done after cycle 26 at R=0.248. Initially the occupancies were held fixed. After cycle 140, slhifts in occupancy and B were applied in alternate cycles to the solvent molecules. Those which refined with low occupancy ( <0.4) or high temperature factor ( > 60 8') were deleted from the model. There were some peaks that had been picked as water molecules by the program but were structurally too bulky. These could be easily ident,ified as MPD molecules. The model was adjusted, with reference to the 3 kinds of map described above, on a PS300 graphics system using FRODO (Jones, 1978). A total of 10 residues, 6 from one molecule and 4 from the other, was modeled into 2 alternative conformations using the discrete disorder option in the refinement program. The progress of the refinement is summarized in Fig. 1. In the 1st 16 cycles only the positional shifts were a,pplied, afterwards B-shifts were also included. Occupancy was refined only for the solvent molecules after cycle 140. During the final 20 cycles, planar restra.ints for the peptide linkage were released. Thus the w angle about the peptide bond was restrained only by the torsiona. angle restraints. At cycle 120, all the 26,415 reflections in the 5 to 1.68 a resolution range were being used for refinement,. was imposed, Then a cutoff based on F0 > 3.0 cr criterion rejecting a total of 1220 reflections.

The 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit were compared by superposing one over the other by least-squares procedure (Nyburg, 1974), which was performed only on the "superposable" portions. The difference distance matrix calculation (Kundrot & Richards, 1987) provides a means of clearly delineating regions of discrepancy between 2 generally similar structures and thus helps to identify the "superposable" portions. This procedure, with a predefined limit on difference distances, is initially applied to the set of C" atoms. If a C" does not qualify for superposition, the complete residue is left out of the least-squares calculation. If a C" is the other atoms in that found to be "superposable" residue are checked through another filter, the "r.m.s. filter". An atom is rejected if it deviates by more than 22 times the r.m.s. value, and at the end the r.m.s. deviation is recomputed. The procedure is repeated iteratively until convergence. The cutoff limit was placed at 3.0 times the r.m.s. deviation. The final superposable set contained 594 out of the 823 atoms and this was used to determine the "best" matrix for superposing the 2 molecules by the least-squares method.

3. Results and Discussion
(a) Rejinement Stereochemistry of the refined model, in terms of the r.m.s. deviations from the standard dictionary values, is given in Table 1. Most of the structure is very well defined by the electron density maps. A segment of the model superposed on (2F, - F,) map is shown in Figure 2. The only region that lacks well-defined density is a stretch of ten residues, 11 to 21, in molecule B. Several attempts were made to model these residues without significant success. Maps were computed after a few cycles of refinement, excluding this segment, or including that

generated from molecule A by applying non-csystallographic symmetry. Neither of the approaches proved to be useful. The same segment in molecule A is readily interpretable as a helix. The final R-factor for 25,969 reflections (F,>3 a) in the 8 to 1.68 a range is 0165. At the end, as an exercise, the final model was further subjected to a few more cycles of refinement with all data and with the original non-locally scaled data. In both cases, the R-factors converged to comparable values (@lSS and 0.169, respectively) without producing any significant changes in the model. The final difference Fourier map is relatively clean. Six peaks are greater than @3 e/A3 (highest 0.37 e/A3) and most of these are located around the disordered helix al in molecule B Overall mean error in the atomic co-ordinates may be estimated to be 0.18 L%by the method of Luzzati (1952) from the radial distribution of R-factor. The observed curve, for a variety of reasons discussed by Chambers & Stroud (1979), does not match the theoretically predicted ones and therefore the estimate depends on the zone of sin (0) being considered. An independent estimate made by the method of Cruickshank (1949, 1967) is 0.13 A. In structures where there are more than one independent molecule, errors in the co-ordinates can be estimated by comparing the molecules in the erystallographic asymmetric unit. Of course the results would depend upon the fraction of the molecules included for the superposition. In the present structure, under stringent conditions (r.m.s. filter with 20 limit), more than 50% of the two molecules overlap on each other with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.18 a. The vectorial distribution of these deviations is almost uniform in all directions without any systematic pattern and, as such, the r.m.s. value may be treated as an estimate of errors in the co-ordinates.

Figure 2. 2F0 - F, map using calculated phases at the end of the refinement shown with a segment of the model Figure 3 shows the Ramachandran plot for the main-chain torsion angles (4 $) (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968). All of the non-glycyl residues lie in the allowed region in molecule A. In molecule B there are two outliers, Asp13 and Thr14, both of which occur in the disordered helix al. One of the residues, Asn83 ((56",37") in A; (49",48") in B), lies in the left-handed a-helical conformation. It occurs in the P-bend (turn 5) connecting two antiparallel strands. Residue 76 is a cis-proline in both the molecules. The o angles for all other residues are distributed on either side of 180" with a r.m.s. deviation of 4.0". The maximum deviation occurs at Leu53 in molecule A (168") and Ala105 (- 169") in molecule B . Leu94 has a x1 of 77" and a x2 of - 177" in both the molecules. This conformation (g',t) is very unusual for leucines according to the rotamer library compiled from the earlier high-resolution structures (Ponder & Richards, 1987). While the more commonly observed conformations are steritally hindered, the (g+,t) orients the Leu side-chain to fit snugly into a pocket formed by Ile38, Leu78, Lys90, Gln98 and Leu99.

The two independent molecules, A and B, have been refined independently without imposing non-crystallographic symmetry restrairns, We have compared the two asymmetric molecules by leastsquares superposition. Figure 4(a) shows the C" backbones of the two molecules superposed using the matrix for the "best" fit. As can be seen from the Figure they are conformationally very similar. However, differences do exist and these can be related to the differences in their environment, as explained in Packing, section (b).

In order to select the "superposable" set of atoms, we initially used the difference distance matrix calculation with a 0.5 a cutoff on difference distances. This criterion excluded 26 residues (6, 10 to 21, 48 to 52, 83 to 85, 104 to 108), mostly from the first a-helix, the adjoining loop and two turns (3 and 5) exposed on the surface of the protein. The 82 C" atoms thus selected matched with a r.m.s. deviation of @23 A. The iterative procedure of the "r.m.s. filter" with a cutoff of 3.0 times the r.m.s. value, when applied to all atoms of these residues, rejected 30 atoms and converged on to a set that superposed with a r.m.s. of @29 8. The matrix thus determined was used for superposing the two molecules. The r.m.s. deviation is 0.94 a for all the 823 atoms, of which 23 deviate by more than 3.0 8. Some 90% (737 atoms) of the structure superpose with a r.m.s. of 0.42 A. Large deviations in the backbone occur at residues 11 to 13, 19 to 20, 83 to 85 and 107 to 108, the largest being at residue 12, which is poorly defined in

molecule B. All these residues are further than 20 h from the active site disulfide. When side-chain atoms are included, additional differences are seen at residues 36 (Lys), 52 (Lys), 62 (Gln), 73 (Arg), 101 (Glu) and 104 (Asp), all of which are on the surface of the protein. The molecules superpose very closely near the active site and larger deviations occur for residues that are radially further out. The radial distribution of deviation from superposition against the distance from the active site disulfide is shown in Figure4(b). The surface near the active site, presumably involved in molecular recognition, is retained in both molecules even under non-identical crystalline environments.

al., 1975). E coli thioredoxin is a compact molecule with dimensions 25 a x 30 a x 35 8. The most pronounced deviation from an almost spherical surface of this protein is the active site helix, which protrudes on one side of the molecule (Fig. 5). The protein molecule folds to form a core of j-pleated sheet flanked on either side by helices. The mixed p-sheet contains five strands and is The structure can be considered as being twisted. formed of two conformational domains, /?ct/%$ from residues 1 to 59 and fiba from residues 76 to 108 (Fig. 5). These two correspond roughly to the two obtained by a selective proteolysis fragments at Arg73 (Xlaby & Holmgren, 1975). It has been observed that the larger fragment can fold independently at low pH (Reutimann et al., 1981) and the two together can form a non-covalent complex having partial activity (Slaby & Holmgren, 1979). The two conformational domains are connected by an 18 residue long segment that runs as distorted belices across the pleated sheet. (b) Secondary (i) HeZices The structure contains four a-helices and a distorted 310 helix displayed on the external surface of this globular molecule. The a-helices are labeled as al from residues I1 to 17, a2 from 32 to 49, a3 from 59 to 63 and a4 from 95 to 107, in conformity with the earlier description (Holmgren et al., 1975). The 310 helix (residues 66 to 70) contains two 4-l hydrogen bonds, 066 N69 and 067 . . N70. In molecule B, the al region is highly distorted from a regular helical geometry. a3 contains a hydrogen bond between 059 . . N63. However, the intervening main-chain torsion angles deviate significantly from the standard a-helical values. The average of the backbone torsion angles for the a-helices, excluding the terminal residues, is structure and hydrogen bonding

(- 65", - 39") for molecule A, in close agreement to those determined for the high-resolution structure of crambin (-63", - 40") (Hendrickson. & Teeter, 1981). In molecule B these values are (--64", -38"), when the disordered ctl is omitted from the calculations. The short a3 was not included in either case. Helix a3 is stabilized by hydrogen bonds from the side-chain oxygen atom of Asn59 to N61 and N62. Preference of Asn to occur at the N terminus and make hydrogen bonds to the backbone NH of the exposed residues in the first turn of the helix through its OD has been pointed out by Richardson & Richardson (1988). The 3,0 helix is distorted at the C terminus with a 6+1 hydrogen bond between 067 . . . N72. Helix ~2, the longest in the structure, is broken near a proline residue (see Fig. 6). There are two proline residues in this helix. Pro34 occurs in the first turn and is accommodated into the helical hydrogen bonding scheme. Pro40, however, introduces a break. 036, in the middle of the helix, makes a 4-1 hydrogen bond to N39 instead of the expected 5-l interaction with X40. The helix bends at this point by 35". The regular helical pattern follows from that point on until the completion of the a2 helix after introducing an a(,) distortion at Ile38, which interacts with N42 and also its regular counterpart N42. c+,) distortion involves 5-1 and 4-+ 1 bifurcated hydrogen bonds a,t the N-terminal end of a-helices (Baker & Hubbard, 1984). Pro40 is thus accommodated into the helix as if it occurred in the first turn. The C-terminal end of each helix is distorted from the regular geometry exhibiting bydrogen bonds other than the regular 5-+1 type (Fig. 6). In helix al of molecule A, carbonyl oxygen 013 makes both 5-11 (N17) and 6+1 hydrogen bonds (N18).

N106. .0103, N107 . .0103). The hydrogenbonding interaction to the backbone oxygen of PhelO2 is completed by the side-chain ND2, instead of the amide N, of AsnlO6. Such distortions at the ends of the helices are not uncommon (Baker & Hubbard, 1984). (ii) /?-sheet contains a /I pleated sheet of five Thioredoxin strands that forms the core of the molecule. Most of the residues in the sheet are hydrophobic. Residues 3 to 8, 21 to 28, 53 to 59, 76 to 82 and 86 to 92 form the five strands that have been labeled as strands /I1 to /I5, respectively. The sheet is composed of parallel (p) and antiparallel (a) strands with the pattern lp3p2a4a5. scheme in the sheet is The hydrogen-bonding shown in Figure 7. The sheet is twisted and at the ends, where the strands are splayed apart, the

hydrogen bonds are oft'en completed through intervening water molecules. Backbone 03 and 07 of /?I with N55 and N59, respectively, of ,53 interact through water molecules. Similarly bridging water molecules are observed between 021 and N83 as well as N22 and 052, connecting 82 to fi3 and 84. Residues 76 to 92 form the last two antiparallel strands linked through a hairpin turn (residues 82 to (Richardson et al., B978) 85). A classic b-bulge residues occurs between these two strands involving 87 to 88 of ,l?5 and 80 of 84. N80 hydrogen bonds to 088, while 080 hydrogen bonds to N87 in an otherwise perfect P-sheet. (iii) Reverse turns P-Turns are generally composed of four residues forming a bend involving a 441 hydrogen bond.

(Venkatachalam, 1968). There are four /?-turns in the structure of thioredoxin that belong to one or another of these classes. There is also a reverse turn involving a cis-proline residue without the 4-l hydrogen bond. Conformational details of these turns are listed in Table 2. The chain reverses in direction between residues 19 to 22, but the geometry of this segment does not conform to that of the tight turns. The distance c"19. . . C"22 is 7.5 8, greater than the normally considered limit (7 A) for reverse turns (Richardson, 1981). Turn 1 (residues 8 t#o 11) at the junction of /?l and crl involves a 4-+1 hydrogen bond that is a bifurcated interaction for 08 (08 . . Nil and . N12). This bend is of type III in molecule A and is of t'he very closely related type I in B. It is stabilized by additional hydrogen bonds involving the side-chain OG of Serll (Serll OG . N8) and OGl of Thr8, as shown in Figure 8(a). A type I turn (29 to 32) links fl2 to a2, and a type II turn (49 to 52,53) links a2 to 83. Both of these turns have a well-formed 4+1 hydrogen bond. The type II turn proceeds to include the fifth residue, forming a 5-l hydrogen bond that is a bifurcated interaction for 049. In the type II turns, the i+ 2 position is predominantly

occupied by a glycine residue (Wilmot & Thornton, 1988), an observation supported by the present structure. fi4 starts after a reversal in the chain direction through a type VIb turn (74 to 77) (Rilchardson, 1981) involving the cis-proline (Pro76) (Fig. S(b)). None of the main-chain atoms interacts directly with each other in this turn. The main stabilizing interaction occurs between the side-chain OGl of Thr77 and main-chain carbonyl oxygen of residue 74. Thr77 OGl in that position, also interacts with the main-chain nitrogen atom of Arg73 through a water molecule. The antiparallel strands 84 and fl5 are connected by a p-hairpin turn (82 to 85) of the type I'. Sibanda & Thornton (1985) have observed that type I' is predominant for the antiparallel hairpin bends. Occurrence of Asn83 at i+ 1 and Gly84 at i+2 positions in the loop is consistent with the strong sequence preferences pointed out by these authors. (iv) Hydrogen bonding elements, structure of

E. coli thioredoxin. Except for ten residues all belong to the sheet, a helix or a turn. These structural elements are stabilized mainly through hydrogen bonds between backbone N and 0 atoms. Mean value of hydrogen bond distances in the a helices is 3.02( + 0.12) A in both molecules. The short 3r0 helix also gives a similar value. In the P-sheet, this value is 2.92( kO.11) A in molecule A and 249(*@11) A in molecule B. Hydrogen bonds in B-turns, on an average, are 3.00( kO.12) A long.

Main-chain-side-chain interactions are fewer in number compared to the main-chain-main-chain interactions as in most other proteins. This observation is consistent with the fact that most polar sidechains are distributed on the outside surface of the protein molecule, while a considerable fraction of atoms are buried in the interior. the main-chain Most of the main-chain-side-chain hydrogen bonds (Table 3) are short-range interactions occurring within four residues along the polypeptide chain.

The intramolecular side-chain-side-chain interactions include five salt bridges from lysine residues to Asp or Glu residues (Lys3 NZ . . Asp2 OD2, Lys3 NZ . Asp47 ODl, Lys96 NZ . Glu44 OEl, Lys96 NZ . . .GIu48 OEl, LyslOO NZ . . Glu48 OE2). In addition to these, Asp13 OD2 forms an ion pair with Lysl8 NZ in molecule A. This interaction is not seen in molecule B as the 13th residue belongs to the disordered part of the molecule. Trp31, situated near the active site disulfide group, is held in position by hydrogen bonds to Asp61 carboxyl oxygen atoms (Trp31 NE1 Asp61 ODI, OD2). The segment Asn63 to Thr66 connecting a3 and the 3,, helices has a nondescript conformation and displays no direct interactions within itself. Direct hydrogen bonding interactions are with only one single residue on the protein, i.e. Asp9. The segment curls around Asp9, hydrogen bonding to all possible and sidesites through both main-chain-side-chain chain-side-chain interactions, as shown in Figure 9. The Thr66 OGI . .09 hydrogen bond is water molecule mediated.

elements

As explained in earlier sections; the fi pleated sheet is packed on either side by heliees: a2, a4 on one side and al, cr3, 3,, on the other. The interface between the helices and the sheet is predominantly hydrophobic. The side-chains interdigitate to form clusters of hydrophobic residues on either side of the sheet, as shown in Figure 10. The residues in the two clusters account for nearly half the amino acid residues in the sequence and the other half, most of are distributed on the which are hydrophilic, solvent-exposed surface of the helices and the exterior strands, as well as the turns and loops. The long helices a2 and a4 pack against each other through hydrophobic interactions on the sheet side and through a network of charged interactions involving Glu44, Glu48, Lys96, LyslOO a,nd a hydrogen bond involving Tyr49 and Asp1 04 on the solvent side. Helices ctl, a3 and 3,, do not interact as extensively.

(d) Side-chains E. coli thioredoxin is an acidic protein. It has 11 Asp and five Glu residues compared to ten Lys, one Arg and one His. All, except Asp26, are distributed on the surface of the molecule. Many of them form ion pairs: either intramolecular, which are imporintegrity, or intermolecular, tant for the structural which are important in crystal packing. Asp26 is internal yet accessible to solvent through a narrow channel that is occupied by two closely bound water It pairs with a lysine (Asp26 molecules. QDl . Lys 57 NZ=48 A) through a water molecule. The aromatic residues in the structure include four Phe, two Trp, two Tyr and one His. Almost all of these exhibit a x2 torsion angle near + 90", which seems to be a preferred conformation in all protein structures (Ponder & Richards, 1987). Trp28 deviates from this value with a x2 of -66", partly due to steric interactions with the well-positioned Asn59 side-chain. Phel2, Phe27, Phe81 and Tyr70 cluster together in a tetrahedral arrangement with pairwise centroid separations of less than 7.0 A (except Phe27 and Phe81, which are further). They interact with each other in an edge-to-face fashion as shown in Figure 11 (Burley & Petsko, 1985; Singh & Thornton, 1985). Each of these phenylalanine rings is held in position through contacts on either side provided by the Val, Ile or Thr side-chains. Phe81 is sandwiched between Vall6 and Val86, Phe27 between He72 and Va125, and Phel2 between Thr66 and Va116. The fourth phenylalanine, Phe102, has the aliphatic side-chains of Lys90 and Asn106 on either side of the ring. ND2 of AsnlO6 interacts with the aromatic ring of PhelO2 through the perpendicular aminoaromatic interactions, as described by Burley & Petsko (1986). Trp28 has the aliphatic side-chain of Lys57 running roughly across the indole ring at a

distance of 4 to 5 A on one side and Asn59 ND2 at 3.7 A from the centroid of the benzenoid portion on the other. Trp31 is on the surface of the protein. A well-defined MPD molecule is packed against it in molecule B. The same residue in molecule A is in a different environment because of packing differences.

residue number. The average B for the main-chain atoms in molecule A is 17.09 A', for side-chain atoms 20.83 A2 and for all protein atoms 18.86 A2. In molecule B these values are 20.21 A2, 24.06 A2 and 22.04 A2, respectively. Except for the residues near t'he two termini and in the disordered segment, all residues have comparable B values in the two molecules and show the same pattern of variation along the chain. The B values peak at the turns and loops exposed to solvent, while making troughs at each of the strands that form the core of the protein molecule. Residues 102 to 108 of a4 and 11 to 21 of or1 show large differences in B values, the former being less ordered in molecule A and the latter in B. (ii) Discrete disorder Ten residues in the structure have been modeled as two conformers based on the indications in the electron density maps. These residues had regions of extra electron density, next to their side-chains, that could not be accounted for by solvent molecules. The density was reasonable for an alternative side-chain conformation, even though not as well defined as in other sections of the protein. Each conformer was stereochemically acceptable and, when assigned an occupancy of 95, refined with a temperature factor comparable to the average B of the protein molecules. The side-chain torsion angles are listed in Table 4. Tle23, Leu58 and Leu80 are in a hydrophobic environment and have room to exist in one of the two conformations.

5. Active Site
The active site is located at the amino end of ~2, on the surface of the protein. It contains two redox active cysteine residues separated by two residues in a sequence Cys32-Gly33Pro34-Cys35, which is highly conserved in thioredoxins (Luthman & Holmgren, 1982). In the present crystal form the protein is oxidized and the disulfide bridge forms a

14-membered ring involving residues 32 to 35. Pro34, Ile75, Pro76 and Trp28 are in the immediate vicinity of the S-S bond and provide a hydrophobic environment in the active site. Figure 13 shows all the residues within 10 A of the active sitme disulfide bridge. accessibility Solvent calculations (Lee & Richards, 1971) show that SG of Cys32 is accessible, though partially, while Cys35 is completely buried. Consequently external thiol groups can interact with Cys32 in the initial step of reduction. Also, solution studies have indicated that Cys32 is much more reactive than Cys35, with an abnormally low pK value of 6.7 (Kallis & Holmgren, 1980). The redox reactions initiated at the nucleophilic Cys32 two orders of magnitude faster are approximately than model compounds at neutral pH for both the oxidation and reduction reactions (Holmgren, 1979). The most plausible explanation for this enhancement in reactivity is the presence of a local positive electric potential to stabilize the linear anionic three-sulfur atom intermediate state (Rosenfeld, 1977). Effects of local electrostatic field on the disulfide exchange kinetics have been studied in detail by Snyder et al. (1981). The presence of a positive charge in the local environment is known to lower the pK and increase the apparent nucleophilicity of the cysteine while a negative charge does just the opposite (Parente et al., 1985). The sidechain amino group of Lys36 has been suggested earlier to provide such positive electrostatic potential (Kallis & Holmgren, 1980). In the refined structure, Lys36 NZ is farther than 8 A from the two sulfur atoms (8.3 A and 89 A). Lys57 is the only other positive charge in the general vicinity (11.1 A and 9.4 A from the 2 sulfur atoms). 0n the basis of earlier X-ray analysis, Ho1 (1985) pointed out that the reactive cysteine residue is located near the N-terminal end of a helix and the positive electrostatic field of the helix dipole may have functional significance. The refinement has indicated that

Cys32 is, in fact, in the first turn of the helix a2 (with a helical 032 . N36 hydrogen bond) and the active site disulfide is placed directly over the amino terminus of the helix. The reinterpretation of the active site strongly reinforces HOI'S explanation for the exceptional reactivity of the protein. Also, Cys32 SG is involved in a hydrogen bond with the main-chain N35 (3.2 A), while Cys35 SG is devoid of any such interactions, the closest main-chain amino group being at 42 8. This feature may also contribute to making Cys32 more reactive. Residues 29 to 37, containing the active site, form a protrusion on the surface of the protein (Holmgren et al., 1975). This segment displays relatively fewer interactions with the other parts of the structure. The main-chain atoms are involved in short-range helical or p-turn hydrogen bonds. The side-chains interact with the surroundings mostly t'hrough the The only direct interaction is water molecules. between Trp31 NE1 and the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Asp61. On the other hand, the polypeptide chain just preceding and succeeding this segment is held firmly in position through sequentially long-range, interactions. Residues direct protein-protein preceding 29, i.e. 21 to 28, form the middle strand of the P-sheet and are held in position through strong main-chain-main-chain hydrogen bonds and also side-chain-side-chain interactions in the hydrophobic cluster. Similarly, residues after 37, i.e. 38 to 49, are in a helix that makes strong interactions including salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals' contacts with the neighboring structure, a4, of the twop-sheet and residues 1 to 3. Comparison dimensional n.m.r. spectra of the oxidized and the reduced forms of thioredoxin (Dyson et al., 1988) has indicated significant chemical shift changes for the proton resonances in the active site region (residues 27 to 35) and on the nearby surface upon reduction but very little alteration elsewhere.

The disulfide bond has been refined using restraints over bond distances, bond angles and thermal parameters. The two C" atoms are 5.2 a apart, which is the center of the distribution of observed C-c" distances in protein disulfide groups (Richardson, 1981; Thornton, 1981). The S-S bond is 2.09 a in A and 2.05 a in B. The x1 for Cys32 is 165" (A) and 167" (B), while that for Cys35 is -62" in both molecules. The x2 of Cys32 and Cys35 are in A and - 136" and - 132" and 79", respectively, 82" in B. The S-S bridge is right-handed, with a torsion angle of 81" in A and 72" in B. These values are in the common regions observed in protein disulfide groups (Thornton, 1981). This strongly indicates that the high reactivity of thioredoxin is not due to conformational stress on the disulfide bond.

6. Solvent Structure
(a) Water molecules
Water molecules form an extensive network of hydrogen bonding interactions in the crystal. Solvent-mediated interactions were traced using the program TRACE-HBOND written by S. Katti. The program follows the hydrogen bond network through solvent molecules from one protein atom to another and lists the path. A program to achieve similar results has also been reported by Sheriff et al. (1987). Clearly there are multiple paths involving different sets of water molecules between the same two protein atoms. Lys57 NZ interacts intramolecularly with the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Asp26 and Asp43 through water molecules. Lys36 NZ interacts with Glu44 OEI on the adjacent molecule through a water and an MPD molecule. Water molecules mediate interactions between like charges, as for example in Lys82 NZ . W , W . Lys90 NZ, Asp61 OD2 .W . W _ . W . . . Glu44 QE2 from two different molecules.

Twenty-five pairs of water molecules obey the non-crystallographic symmetry that relates the two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table 5). They superpose on each other with a r.m.s. deviation of 038 a and participate in similar interactions with the protein molecules except for (W20, W52). The exceptions are located in a molecular interface and their overlap is probably accidental. All but (WB,W41; W43,W101; W105,W86; and four W 129, W 118) are involved in forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds to protein atoms either directly or through a similar water molecule and thus serve as integral parts of the folded protein structure. Most are well ordered, bind firmly through three or four hydrogen bonds and are located in surface pockets and crevices. The water molecules related by noncrystallographic symmetry often have comparable temperature factors and occupancies. All the water molecules, except 14, form at least one hydrogen bond to a protein atom directly, and thus occur in the first hydration shell. The 14 water molecules that are further than 3.3 a from the protein each have a higher B value, sometimes also associated with a lower occupancy, and form hydrogen bonds to protein through water molecules on the inner layer. (b) Methylpentanediol
molecules

MPDs provide non-bonded contacts to the loops and may, therefore, be important for stabilizing their conformation in the crystal. Holmgren & Siiderberg (1970) have reported earlier that the protein a solution could be crystallized from containing ethanol. It may be possible that ethanol molecules could replace MPDs in these sites. Another MPD molecule is packed at the interface of three molecules. Tt makes non-bonded contacts with Asp10 of A, TrpYl of B and Pro40 of a symmetryrelated A. Its hydroxyl 02 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp43 On1 of the third molecule.

7. Packing
Each protein molecule is surrounded by eight other near neighbors. Molecule A contacts t'hree A and five B molecules either directly or indirectly through water molecules. Molecule B, likewise, interacts with five A and three B molecules (Fig. 14). The molecular interfaces are packed with water molecules and the MPDs. 2-fold axis associates t'wo The crystallographic like molecules (A/A and B/B) such that their 85 strands run antiparallel to each ot'her at a distance suitable for making hydrogen bonds. The sheet is thus extended into the neighboring molecule. The a4 helices of the two molecules are antiparallel to each other and make contacts through their sidechains. This interface is the largest of the eight for both A and B. The B/B dimer has some additional interactions that are not found in the A/A. GlulOl OEl of a B and Asp104 OD2 of its symmetryrelated equivalent form a pair of hydrogen bonds between the two ~4s across the 2-fold axis. A third Asp . Glu intermolecular hydrogen bond occurs between Asp20 ODI of B and Glu85 OE2 of an A. The structure thus contains Asp Glu inter-

Five out of the seven MPD molecules are found in the surface pockets created next to the loops in the structure. Two MPD molecules pack on either side of the loop 71-74. One fits into a pocket formed by the loop and Ile60, Ala67-Pro68; and the other into that formed by the loop, Thr89-Va191, of one molecule and Tyr70, Va186 of its symmetry equivalent. An MPD molecule located in A/B interface packs against the loop 93-95 of molecule A. These

actions directly between their carboxyl groups when packed in the crystal lattice. At the crystallization pW of 3.8 a significant proportion of these residues are probably uncharged and such interactions are possible. The intermolecular salt bridge Glu85 QEl Lysl8 NZ links two crystallographically non-equivalent molecules. (a) Copper co-ordination There are two cupric ions in the asymmetric unit. Each of them is six-co-ordinated in a distorted octahedral geometry (Fig. 15). The amino terminal nit)rogen atom, the amide nitrogen of Asp2 and the side-chain ODl of Asp2 belong to one molecule, while the side-chain oxygen atoms of Asp10 come from a crystallographic symmetry-related molecule. The sixth position of the co-ordination sphere is occupied by a strongly bound water molecule. The four atoms at the corners of the square plane about Cu (Serl Nl, Asp2 N2, Asp2 ODl and Asp10 ODl) are in the range of 1.97 to 2.09 A from the central metal atom. The two apical ligands are placed at a relatively larger distance (251 to 2.65 A). Similar square planar bipyramidal co-ordination for copper involving terminal amino nitrogen has been documented earlier (Cooper et al., 1962; Freeman & Taylor, 1965). Each protein molecule binds to two cupric ions, one at each of the two ends of /Il. Conversely, each copper binds to two protein molecules linking the top of one strand to the bottom of the other strand to form a zigzag line of molecules running parallel to the y-axis. The crystallographic 2-fold axis repeats lines to form a layer of protein these zigzag molecules in the (z,y) plane. Interactions between the fl5s and the ~14s explained above serve as the stabilizing forces between these lines of molecules. Each layer so formed is composed of crystallographically equivalent molecules (only As or only Bs). The A and B layers alternate along the z-axis. (b) Environment of A and B molecules

1974) and very little rotation (5.4" about the crystallographic X-axis). The X component of the translation vector is small (6003a) and the Z component is almost half the cell axis (0.486~). `The Y component (@108b), being not compatible with the crystallographic transformations, is largely responsible for the differences in the environments. The differences between the two independent molecules are mostly lattice induced. al (residues 11 to 17) and the adjoining loop (residues 18 to 21) in molecule A are involved in several interactions with the surroundings and are found to be better ordered. The same region in molecule B displays muchL fewer contacts and a consequent disorder (also indicated by high B values in Fig. 12). The C-terminal half of helix a4 (residues 102 to 108), on the other hand, is better packed in molecule B than in A. We thank Drs Harold Wyckoff and Frederic Richards for their counsel and support during the course of this work and Drs Bengt-Olof Siiderberg, Arne Holmgren and Carl-Ivar Branden for their contribut'ion in the earlier parts of the project. We thank Dr Arne Holmgren for the continuous supply of the protein sample for the work done in Uppsala. The support of NIH grants GM-22778
