A constitutively active and nuclear form of the MAP kinase ERK2 is sufficient for neurite outgrowth and cell transformation
Megan J. Robinson*, Stephen A. Stippec*, Elizabeth Goldsmith, Michael A. White and Melanie H. Cobb*
Background: Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are ubiquitous components of many signal transduction pathways. Constitutively active variants have been isolated for every component of the extracellular-signalregulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 MAP kinase pathway except for the ERK itself. Results: To create an activated ERK2 variant, we fused ERK2 to the low activity form of its upstream regulator, the MAP kinase kinase MEK1. The ERK2 in this fusion protein was active in the absence of extracellular signals. Expression of the fusion protein in mammalian cells did not activate endogenous ERK1 or ERK2. It was sufficient, however, to induce activation of the transcription factors Elk-1 and AP-1, neurite extension in PC12 cells in the absence of nerve growth factor, and foci of morphologically and growthtransformed NIH3T3 cells, if the fusion protein was localized to the nucleus. A cytoplasmic fusion protein was without effect. Conclusions: Activation of ERK2 is sufficient to cause several transcriptional and phenotypic responses in mammalian cells. Nuclear localization of activated ERK2 is required to induce these events.

Background
In eukaryotic cells, activation of ubiquitous mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases contributes to cell-type and ligand-specific responses [1,2]. MAP kinase cascades contain a conserved core of enzymes known as the MAP kinase module, which consists of a MAP kinase, a MAP kinase kinase or MEK, and a MEK kinase. The best characterized MAP kinase module contains extracellularsignal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2. The functions of the ERK pathway, containing the upstream regulators MEK1 and MEK2 and Raf isoforms, are diverse but have been associated with cell proliferation and differentiation [1,2]. Constitutively active MAP kinase variants would be valuable reagents to define the functions of these kinases in physiological processes. Unfortunately, no such molecules have been described to date. Genetic screens have not yielded gain-of-function MAP kinase mutants of use in mammalian systems. For example, the Drosophila sevenmaker mutant has only 2­3-fold greater activity than unphosphorylated wild-type ERK in Drosophila [3]. ERK2 is normally activated more than 1000-fold by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine [4]. In mammalian cells, the sevenmaker mutant still requires activation by MEKs and does not have increased basal activity; thus, this mutant cannot be used as a constitutive kinase in mammalian cells [5].

Attempts to make structure-based site-directed mutants of ERK2 with constitutive activity have been unsuccessful [6] (M.J.R., M.H.C. and E.G., unpublished observations). Recently, the structure of phosphorylated, active ERK2 was solved [7]. Comparison of the high and low activity structures [8] suggested no obvious strategy for creating a constitutively active ERK2 by mutagenesis, because of the global reorganization of domains that occurs in the structure upon ERK2 activation and phosphorylation. Thus, to create a constitutively active ERK2, we fused ERK2 as a single polypeptide to its upstream activator MEK1. The fusion produced an ERK2 that was constitutively active in the absence of upstream signals. MEK1 in the fusion protein had no effect on endogenous ERKs. We were then able to direct active ERK2 to different subcellular compartments and examine its effects on several biological processes. We show that active ERK2 induced the phosphorylation of Elk-1, the activation of the transcription factors AP-1 and Elk-1, and was sufficient to cause both neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and transformation of NIH3T3 cells. These functions of ERK2 were dependent on the subcellular localization of the active enzyme.

The ERK2­MEK1 fusion protein and other fusion proteins described below were expressed as stable, fulllength proteins in mammalian cells (Figure 2a) and no cleavage of the molecules occurred (see Supplementary material published with this paper on the internet). The immunoprecipitated ERK2­MEK1 fusion protein was at least 50-fold more active than either a vector-alone control or an inactive ERK2 fusion protein, K52R-ERK2­MEK1, which was expressed to the same extent (Figure 2). Mutation of K52 to arginine reduces ERK2 catalytic activity by more than 99% [9]. In comparison, when ERK2 and MEK1 were coexpressed as separate proteins, the ERK2 activity recovered was less than 10% of that of ERK2 in the fusion protein (data not shown). Replacing wild-type MEK1 in the fusion protein with a kinase-dead form resulted in a fusion protein with activity no greater than the vector-alone control (see Supplementary material). The MEK1/2 inhibitor PD098059 [10] had no effect on the activity of the active ERK2 fusion protein (data not shown), suggesting that basal activity of endogenous Raf was not required for activating ERK2­MEK1. Dephosphorylating the fusion protein reduced its activity and incubating it under phosphorylating conditions restored its activity, indicating that ERK2 in the fusion protein is activated by phosphorylation (see Supplementary material). We wished to determine if endogenous ERKs were substrates for ERK2­MEK1. Endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 were not activated even at the highest level of ERK2­MEK1 expression, although they were activated 10-fold by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or phorbol ester (PMA), as shown either by blotting with an antibody against active ERK (Figure 3a) or by immunoprecipitation and immune-complex kinase assay (Figure 3b). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ERK2 that was cotransfected with the ERK2­MEK1 fusion protein was activated no more

To create an ERK2­MEK1 fusion protein, a linker of 10 amino acids, composed of an alternating copolymer of glutamate and glycine, was connected to the carboxyl terminus of rat ERK2, and the coding sequence of human MEK1 was fused in-frame. The linker provided a flexible region between the two protein domains that was of sufficient length to allow proper folding (Figure 1). Vector sequence from the original MEK1 construct was included. Thus, the sequence between ERK2 and MEK1 is

than twofold (data not shown). Thus, the MEK1 expressed in the fusion protein specifically acts on the ERK it is fused with and does not activate endogenous ERK or ERK regulators.
Subcellular localization of the ERK2­MEK1 fusion protein

Upon phosphorylation by MEK, a fraction of ERK2 translocates to the nucleus where it can then phosphorylate nuclear substrates [11­15]. MEK1, however, contains a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence, which causes it to retain a cytoplasmic localization even in stimulated cells [16,17]. Given the opposing signals on ERK2 and MEK1, we wanted to determine the subcellular localization of the ERK2­MEK1 fusion protein. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of 293 cells revealed that it was localized in the cytoplasm (Figure 4a). Thus, it appeared that either the MEK1 export sequence was dominant, or that ERK2 could no longer translocate properly. To distinguish between these possibilities, the four leucines in MEK1 that are crucial for nuclear export [16] were mutated to alanine. This mutant MEK1 was substituted for wild-type

MEK1 in the fusion construct, producing ERK2­MEK1LA (Figure 2a). In transiently transfected cells, this fusion protein had 5­10-fold higher kinase activity than equivalent amounts of wild-type ERK2­MEK1 (Figure 2b), whereas in stably transfected cells both fusion proteins had equivalent activities (data not shown). The differential activity of ERK2­MEK1-LA was not surprising, because Mansour et al. [18,19] have shown that the region in MEK1 containing the export sequence is also important in controlling MEK1 activity. Like ERK2­MEK1, ERK2­MEK1-LA had no effect on the activity of endogenous ERK1/2 (Figures 3a,b). Neither of these fusion proteins activated the endogenous p38 or Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence staining of 293 cells expressing ERK2­MEK1-LA showed that the fusion protein was localized to the nucleus (Figure 4b); even in cells expressing low amounts, the majority was in the nucleus. Thus, active ERK2 created via fusion to MEK1

Elk-1. ERK2­MEK1 did not induce expression of an AP-1dependent luciferase reporter (Figure 6a) or a serum response element (SRE) reporter (data not shown) even when 20 µg of plasmid were transfected, whereas ERK2­MEK1-LA induced expression from both reporters. Because the activity of ERK2­MEK1-LA was higher than that of ERK2­MEK1, we compared different amounts of plasmid expressing ERK2­MEK1-LA to test the effects of small amounts of this protein on AP-1 activity (Figure 6b). Using 5 µg of plasmid, ERK2­MEK1-LA stimulated AP-1 activity by 30-fold. Even when only 10 ng of plasmid were introduced, ERK2­MEK1-LA stimulated AP-1 activity by 6-fold. Under these conditions, the amount of fusion protein expressed could no longer be detected by western blotting. Thus, the nuclear fusion protein is a potent AP-1 activator. On the other hand, neither ERK2 fusion protein activated an NFB-dependent reporter more than a few fold (data not shown). As a control for the ability of the cytoplasmic fusion protein to phosphorylate substrates, we cotransfected cells with constructs expressing the substrate ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk) and various fusion proteins (Figure 5b). Rsk was activated by ERK2­MEK1 to the same extent as by phorbol ester, demonstrating that ERK2­MEK1 has intracellular activity. Interestingly, ERK2­MEK1-LA was a more potent Rsk activator, which may reflect the fact that Rsk also cycles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus [11].
Effect of ERK2­MEK1 fusion proteins on PC12 cell differentiation

To determine whether ERK2­MEK1 and ERK2­MEK1LA could phosphorylate a known ERK2 substrate, we examined the phosphorylation of the ternary complex factor Elk-1 [20­24]. Elk-1 was expressed in 293 cells either alone or together with an activated mutant of the GTPase Ras, RasV12, or with ERK2­MEK1 or ERK2­MEK1-LA. Elk-1 phosphorylation was monitored using an antibody that recognizes Elk-1 only when it is phosphorylated on Ser383, a site of ERK phosphorylation that is important for transactivating activity [20,22]. Only RasV12 and the nuclear fusion protein ERK2­MEK1-LA caused an increase in Elk-1 phosphorylation (Figure 5a). The cytoplasmic variant ERK2­MEK1 did not. As confirmation, a large band shift in the position of Elk-1 on the gel occurred when it was coexpressed with ERK2­MEK1LA but not when it was coexpressed with ERK2­MEK1 (Figure 5a, top panel). It is unlikely that the difference in the activities of the two fusion proteins can account for their differing abilities to phosphorylate Elk-1 as we show below in our physiological assays that comparable activities of the two fusions still produce the same results. Consistent with the above results, ERK2­MEK1-LA but not ERK2­MEK1 induced significant expression of an Elk1-dependent luciferase reporter (Figure 6a). The cytoplasmic ERK2­MEK1 fusion protein displayed a limited ability to activate Elk-1-mediated transcription. This is likely to be due to the overexpression of Elk-1 as a Gal­Elk-1 fusion in these assays resulting in a small amount of cytoplasmic

and therefore ERK, is sufficient to induce this phenotype [25­27]. To test whether ERK activity is sufficient for differentiation, we examined the consequences of expressing ERK2­MEK1 and ERK2­MEK1-LA in PC12 cells. Transfected cells were scored for neurite formation after 48­96 hours in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF). ERK2­MEK1-LA was comparable to NGF in its ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth (Figure 7). Thus, expression of an activated ERK2 variant targeted to the nucleus is sufficient to promote neurite extension in the absence of NGF. In contrast, ERK2­MEK1, which was retained in the cytoplasm, caused no more neurite extension than a vector control. In addition, neither MEK1-LA nor ERK2 alone induced neurite outgrowth (Figure 7). A fusion protein containing ERK2 linked to a constitutively active form of MEK1 (S118D, S222E) [18], termed ERK2­MEK1-SDSE, produced an ERK2 that was slightly more active than that in ERK2­MEK1-LA. ERK2­MEK1-SDSE, although cytoplasmic, had an increased ability to induce neurites (Figure 7) compared with ERK2­MEK1. The ERK2­MEK1-SDSE fusion protein activated endogenous ERKs to a modest extent, around sevenfold (Figure 3c), however. Thus, its ability to produce some PC12 cell differentiation is likely to be due to the activation of endogenous ERKs. Because MEK1-LA had an increased ability to activate ERK2 relative to wild-type MEK1 in the context of the fusion proteins, we wanted to compare the function of equivalent amounts of fusion protein activity on neurite extension. Smaller amounts of ERK2­MEK1-LA DNA were transfected compared with ERK2­MEK1 so that comparable ERK2 activities were produced. Even under

these conditions, ERK2­MEK1-LA still produced neurites, whereas the cytoplasmic fusion did not. Finally, we constructed a fusion protein that contained K52R ERK2 fused to MEK1-LA, to examine the effects of a kinase-inactive ERK2 in the nucleus. Like KRERK2­MEK1, KR-ERK2­MEK1-LA had no kinase

activity and did not cause neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Interestingly, KR-ERK2­MEK1 was able to block NGF-stimulated neurite formation, whereas its nuclear counterpart was much less effective (Figure 7); this suggests that KR-ERK2 is a more potent inhibitor of ERK function when it is in the cytoplasm. This effect may be because of the formation of unproductive complexes with upstream activators present in the cytoplasm. RasV12, which has been shown to cause neurite extension in the absence of NGF [28], produced more neurite extension than either NGF or ERK2­MEK1-LA in this system (data not shown). This suggests either that Ras may activate pathways that promote PC12 cell differentiation other than the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway, or that the activity of endogenous ERKs in response to Ras exceeds the activity of the fusion protein. Indirect immunofluorescence of both ERK2­MEK1 and ERK2­MEK1-LA in PC12M cells shows that ERK2­MEK1-LA is not only in the nucleus but is also prominent in the cytoplasm along the developing neurite, particularly in the dendrites (Figure 8b, compare with Figure 4b). The wild-type fusion remains cytoplasmic (Figure 8a). Even at 14 hours after transfection, ERK2­MEK1-LA can already be observed on the developing neurite (data not shown). Localization of ERK2 on dendrites has been reported previously [29]. Active ERK2 is likely to have additional functions in PC12 cell differentiation once the signal has been initiated in the nucleus.

Expression of ERK2­MEK1-LA but not ERK2­MEK1 is sufficient to transform cells. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins.

(b) Stable lines selected in geneticin were plated at low density and allowed to grow for several days in low serum. Morphology as visualized by phase contrast microscopy is shown.

Expression of oncogenic Ras or an activated variant of its effector, Raf1, is sufficient to induce growth and morphological transformation of NIH3T3 cells. To determine if constitutively activated ERK2 is sufficient to elicit this phenotype, we examined the consequences of stable expression of ERK2­MEK1 and ERK2­MEK1-LA in focus-formation assays. NIH3T3 cells were transfected

with plasmids encoding ERK2­MEK1, ERK2­MEK1LA, ERK2, MEK1-LA or MEK1-R4F (a MEK1 mutant previously characterized as sufficient to transform immortalized rodent fibroblasts). Only ERK2­MEK1-LA expression resulted in the appearance of foci of growth and morphologically transformed cells in these assays (Figure 9 and data not shown). The cytoplasmic fusion ERK2­MEK1 had no activity in this assay despite detectable levels of expression in stable lines. In addition, ERK2 or MEK1-LA alone were not sufficient to induce foci. Although MEK1-R4F has been shown to transform cells [18], no foci were induced by this mutant in the cell line used in this study. Expression of all constructs in stable transfectants was verified by western blot analysis (data not shown). Finally, in the context of the NIH3T3 stable cell lines, the two fusion proteins did not have different kinase activities (data not shown) as they did in

transient transfections, yet the nuclear fusion ERK2­MEK1-LA is still competent to cause transformation whereas the cytoplasmic fusion is not.

Discussion
Functional characterization of MAP kinase pathways has depended heavily on the use of constitutively active upstream activators such as RasV12 and RafBXB in concert with inhibitors such as the mutant K52R-ERK2, because no active mutants have been available for MAP kinases themselves. A significant problem with the use of upstream components of the pathway is that there may be multiple effectors in addition to MAP kinase, as has been demonstrated for Ras [30,31]. Nevertheless, many downstream effects of constitutively active Ras have been attributed at least in part to the ERK1/2 MAP kinases. Support for this interpretation came from the expression of kinase-defective or autoinhibitory domains of Raf, MEK1 and ERK1/2 or the use of selective MEK inhibitors, which block transformation of fibroblasts and neurite extension in PC12 cells in response to extracellular ligands or to the expression of oncogenic Ras [2]. These inhibitors indicate the requirement for ERKs in these processes, but do not address whether they are sufficient. Because multiple Ras effector pathways exist, each may contribute to a differing extent to the actions of Ras [31]. Overexpression of a component of more than one of these pathways or strong activation of an alternative pathway may lead to the same phenotypic change. Several examples supporting this hypothesis have been reported. Activation of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase is sufficient to transform fibroblasts [32]. Morphological differentiation of PC12 cells can occur in response to activation of SAPK/JNKs [33]. The p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) also causes neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells when directed to the cell membrane, although this function does not require PAK1 catalytic activity [34]. Mutant NGF receptors that can still activate ERK do not cause PC12 cells to differentiate [35] and induction of differentiation by bone morphogenetic protein does not depend on ERK activation [36]. Mutational analysis of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor indicates that stimulation of the Ras­Raf­ERK pathway is not required to mediate PC12 cell differentiation [37]. We show here that a constitutively active form of ERK2 can be created via fusion of ERK2 to its upstream activator MEK1. ERK2­MEK1 fusion proteins had no effect on endogenous ERKs and could be directed to different subcellular compartments. We have ectopically expressed this constitutively activated variant in cells to explore whether activation of ERK is sufficient to induce discrete cellular phenotypes. We demonstrated that ERK2­MEK1-LA caused phosphorylation of Elk-1 in vivo and induced transcription via Elk-1 and AP-1. The

fusion protein had no effect on NFB-driven transcription. These results show that active nuclear ERK2 is sufficient to activate well described effectors that lie downstream of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway. Although many different upstream components may contribute to transcriptional activation of these factors [38], it is clear that ERK2 alone can activate transcription when directed to the nucleus. We found that active ERK2 was sufficient to cause neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells when directed to the nucleus. The subcellular localization of ERK2, in addition to its activity, was also important; when it was retained in the cytoplasm, active ERK2 was unable to cause neurite extension. When expressed in 293 cells, ERK2­MEK1LA appeared to be predominantly nuclear. In PC12 cells, however, ERK2­MEK1-LA was also diffusely localized in the cytoplasm and strongly localized in the extending processes. At early times after transfection, ERK2­MEK1LA was seen at discrete sites on the membrane that might develop into processes. This pattern of localization suggests that ERK2 is involved in promoting neurite and dendrite formation, not only through its actions on gene transcription but also through effects at the site of neurite extension. The fact that cytoplasmic ERK2­MEK1 does not induce neurites is consistent with the idea that at least some phosphorylation events must occur directly in the nucleus. Essential ERK2 substrates that contribute to neurite formation might be present in the plasma membrane. One possibility is the gap junction protein connexin, which is an ERK substrate [39,40]. ERK2 also phosphorylates a number of cytoskeletal proteins such as microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) [41], Tau [42] and dystrophin [43]. Our second biological assay examined the role of ERK2 in cell transformation. When transfected into NIH3T3 cells, constitutively active mutants of MEK1 can induce hallmarks of cell transformation [18]. Furthermore, cell transformation caused by RasV12 can be blocked by dominant-negative MEK or ERK [44,45]. The degree of tumorigenicity obtained with activated Raf or MEK1 isoforms is low compared with that obtained with Ras, however. Other pathways have also been implicated in cell transformation. For example, the GTPase Rac, which can cooperate with Raf in activating the ERK pathway [37], has been shown to cooperate with Raf-1 to induce cell transformation [46,47]. Thus, although the ERK2 pathway appears to be necessary for cell transformation, its sufficiency was not clear. We demonstrate that nuclear active ERK2 is indeed sufficient to induce foci in NIH3T3 cells. It remains to be determined how active ERK2 may interact with other cellular pathways to induce transformation or differentiation. Our active ERK2 constructs should allow us to uncover the functions of ERK2 in these and other intracellular signaling pathways.

Conclusions
Our experiments suggest that fusion of any two kinases that act sequentially into a single polypeptide may create a constitutively active kinase. Recently, protein fusion has been used to successfully reconstitute pathways composed of sequential activators. For example, self-sufficient electron-transport chains have been recreated by fusion of mammalian P450 enzymes with P450 reductases [48]. Also, G-protein-coupled receptors have been fused to G subunits; these fusions are also able to transduce signals efficiently [49,50]. Thus, this technique may have general application in the design of active signaling molecules. Experiments with the ERK2 fusion proteins indicate that activation of ERK2 is sufficient to induce differentiation or transformation depending on the cellular context. Significant localization in the nucleus is required for these phenotypic effects, because activated proteins that are functional in the cytoplasm cannot induce these phenotypic changes.

The antibody against the Myc epitope was from the Cell Culture Center. This antibody was used at 1:100 for blotting and 10 µg used for immunoprecipitation. The antibody A249 used to precipitate endogenous ERK1/2 did not recognize the fusion proteins and has been described [52]. The 12CA5 antibody was used to precipitate and blot the HA­Rsk. The antibody against doubly phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Promega) was used for western blotting at 1:2000. The antibodies against Elk-1 and phospho-Elk-1 were from NEB and used as directed by the manufacturer. In experiments with Elk-1, 10 µg CMV5-Elk-1 was transfected alone or with 100 ng RasV12, 10 µg ERK2­MEK1 or 10 µg ERK2­MEK1-LA. Lysates from transfected cells were prepared ~48 h after transfection in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 and 0.5% Triton X-100 and a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Western blotting was performed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham) using standard conditions. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 200 µl of lysates that had previously been checked by western blotting and shown to contain equivalent amount of expressed proteins. Antibodies were added and the lysates rocked for 1 h at 4°C. A 50% slurry of protein-A­Sepharose (Pharmacia) in lysis buffer (30 µl) was added to each tube for 1 h at 4°C with mixing. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl and once with kinase buffer. For immune-complex kinase assays, a mixture containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl2, 100 µM ATP, 25 µCi [32P]ATP and 0.5 mg/ml MBP was added to beads and incubated for 15 min at 30°C. Samples were then analyzed on SDS­PAGE gels as described [9]. HEK 293 cells were transfected with either 1 µg each of Gal­Elk and Gal­Lux, 1 µg NFB­Lux, or 1 µg AP-1­Lux with 5 µg mCMV5, 5 µg ERK2­MEK1, 5 µg ERK2­MEK1-LA or 100 ng RasV12 plus 4.9 µg mCMV5. Plasmid (1­2 µg) encoding -galactosidase (-gal) was also added to each transfection mixture as a control for transfection efficiency. Cells were placed in medium without serum 18­24 h following transfection. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested in a freshly made buffer containing 70 mM K2HPO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1% NP-40 and protease inhibitors. Lysates were then analyzed for -gal activity [51] and luciferase activity (Promega) using an Optocomp luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized to the -gal activity. Expression of ERK fusion proteins was equivalent in each experiment, as determined by western blotting.

Materials and methods
Plasmids
A 10 amino-acid alternating copolymer of glutamic acid and glycine was added to the carboxyl terminus of either wild-type or K52R ERK2 using PCR. Also, the following vector amino-acid sequence from pRSET was present between the end of the linker and the start codon of MEK1: GGVGSALPGSK. K52R ERK2 has been described [4]. The stop codons were mutated using the same primer. To introduce an epitope tag, products were ligated into the mammalian expression vector mycCMV5. Human MEK1 was the generous gift of N. Ahn. MEK1 was inserted in-frame after the linker following ERK2 to produce the fusion protein ERK2­MEK1. All manipulations of fusion proteins were done at 30°C using TG-1 bacteria to reduce toxicity to the bacteria and the frequency of mutations. The four leucines in the human MEK1 nuclear export sequence [16] were mutated to alanine using the double-stranded DNA Quik Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) producing MEK1-LA. All mutated constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. MEK1-LA was then inserted both into the vector mycCMV5 alone to produce mycCMV5 MEK1-LA or in-frame with either the wild-type or K52R ERK2 linker construct to produce the fusion proteins ERK2­MEK1-LA and KR-ERK2­MEK1-LA. Human MEK1 in which S118 and S122 were mutated to aspartate and glutamate respectively (MEK1-SDSE) was the generous gift of N. Ahn. This MEK was also inserted into the mycCMV5 fusion protein construct to produce ERK2­MEK1-SDSE. The Gal­Lux reporter (pG5E4D38-Lux), Gal­Elk, and CMV5-Elk-His6 were the generous gifts of P. Shaw. The NFB­Lux and AP-1­Lux reporters were the generous gift of A. Thorburn. HA­Rsk and GST­S6 were the generous gifts of J. Blenis and the GST­S6 protein was purified over glutathione­agarose using standard techniques.

Luciferase reporter assays

Indirect immunofluorescence and neurite scoring
Both 293 and PC12 cells were plated on lysine-coated cover slips. Transfections were performed as described above. At 48 h after transfection (293) or 72 h after transfection (PC12) cells were fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The anti-Myc antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100 and diamidinophenylindole (DAPI) was used at 1 µg/ml. Antibody staining and microscopy were carried out using standard techniques. For neurite scoring, PC12 cells were transfected with various plasmids plus a plasmid encoding -gal as a marker for transfection. At 48­96 h after transfection, cells were fixed with warm 3.7% formaldehyde and stained for -gal activity. Blue cells were counted and the number of cells with neurites was scored. In order to be counted the neurite had to be longer than the cell body. The percentage of cells with neurites was normalized to a vector-alone control and expressed as the fold increase in neurite formation.

Cell culture and transfections
HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) plus 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Dishes of cells (60 mm diameter) that were 60­80% confluent were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described [51]. At 18­24 h after transfection, 293 cells were placed in serum-free medium and incubated for a further 18­24 h before harvesting. PC12M cells were the generous gift of J. Johnson. PC12M cells were grown in RPMI plus 10% HS, 5% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. These cells were transfected as above except that 5 h following addition of precipitate, cells were shocked twice for 1 min with 15% glycerol. PC12 experiments using other transfection methods produced

Foci formation and stable transfections
NIH3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described [30] using 1 µg tester DNA together with 1 µg pDCR carrying the NeoR gene. At 2 days post-transfection, each plate was split 1:4 into two plates containing DMEM plus 5% calf serum for

focus-formation assays, and two plates containing DMEM plus 10% calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies), to select for stable transfectants. Focus assays were fixed (10% formaldehyde) and stained with Geimsa 18 days post-split to visualize the foci of transformed cells.

The ERK2­MEK1 fusions are expressed as full-length proteins with no breakdown products. The fusion proteins indicated were transiently expressed in 293 cells and a western blot of lysates was performed with the anti-Myc antibody. (The ERK2­MEK1-I fusion protein in the right-hand lane was not part of these studies.) ERK2 was also transfected as a size marker for possible breakdown products. No smaller molecular weight products were observed.

Phospho-ERK2

Current Biology

Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) can inactivate ERK2­MEK1 fusion proteins but the fusions are quickly reactivated. Either ERK2­MEK1 or ERK2­MEK1-LA were immunoprecipitated from 293 cell lysates and incubated in the absence or presence of 86 µg/ml purified PTP1B for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of vanadate and beads were washed with kinase reaction buffer plus vanadate. MBP kinase assays were then performed for either 1 min or 15 min. Purified phosphorylated ERK2 (phospho-ERK2) was used as a positive control.

Kinase-dead MEK1 (MEK1-KM) cannot activate ERK2 in a fusion protein. ERK2 was fused to MEK1-KM and expressed in 293 cells. Although the fusion protein was expressed well, as indicated by (a) an anti-Myc western blot, (b) immunoprecipitated ERK2­MEK1-KM did not have MBP kinase activity any greater than a vector-alone control.
