Peroxisomal (nonmitochondrial) citrate synthase (CS2) has been purified from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain in which the gene for the mitochondrial citrate synthase (CSl) had been disrupted and no CSl protein is produced. The enzyme, CS2, the sequence of which had been previously determined from its DNA, behaved differently from CSl in its purification, kinetics, stability, and binding to the inner surface of mitochondrial inner membranes. 0 lee1 Academic press, IIIC.

Eucaryotic cells which have both the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle contain both a mitochondrial and a peroxisomal citrate synthase. The mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS1)3 is part of the Krebs cycle which produces COP and reducing equivalents for ATP production from acetyl-CoA whereas the peroxisomal citrate synthase (CS2) is part of the glyoxalate cycle which converts two acetyl-CoA moieties to succinate and NADH allowing that cell to grow on acetate or fatty acids. It is generally believed that the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, citrate synthase, aconitase, isocitrate lyase, malate synthase, and malate dehydrogenase, are peroxisomal. Peroxisomal citrate synthases which have been purified to date (1,2) have been shown to differ slightly from their mitochondrial enzyme counterparts. This has also been established for the yeast citrate synthases (3-5). Thus, it has been shown in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that CSl and CS2 are the products of two different genes. These genes have been sequenced and shown to be 75% homologous but with complete identity in the putative active site residues. Recently Lewin et al. (6) and McCammon et al. (7)

have shown that the "cytoplasmic" yeast citrate synthase is located in peroxisomes. Previous reports from Parvin (8) and from us (9, 10) have provided procedures for the purification of yeast citrate synthase. These procedures were established before it was realized that two different citrate synthases existed. In the yeast used for these purifications the CS2 represents only 20% of total CS in the cell. In addition the purification behavior of CS2 differs from CSl, and CS2 is less stable than CSl so that it seems likely that the previous studies have been on preparations that were predominantly CSl. In procaryotes which have both metabolic cycles, only one form of citrate synthase exists. Since it is possible that the kinetic behavior of the two different on metabolic reguCS isozymes may yield information lation, it was necessary to purify CS2. With the availability of CSl-, CS2-, and overproducing CS2 strains of S. cerevisiae (4) it was possible to isolate each CSl and CS2 with the assurance of no cross contamination with the other isozyme. In this paper, we report the purification of CS2 and compare its kinetic properties, behavior in the presence of various potential metabolic effecters, the stability of the activities, and the difference in the purification of CS2 and CSl.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Strains
The parental strain PSY142 (Matcu, ura3-52, leu2-2, leu2-112, lys2801, ura3-52) and its CSl- derivative (PSY142 (Mata, leu2-2,leu2-112, 1~~2-801, ura3-52, citl::LEUZ)) were obtained from L. Guarente (3).

Recombinant

DNA Techniques

The EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of CS2 gene was cloned into the pKl0 yeast shuttle vector (CSZ/pKlO) according to standard procedures (4). The recombinant plasmid was used to transform PSY142 CSl- cells by the procedure of Ito et al. (11).

Enzyme Methodology
Citrate synthase was assayed at room temperature using the DTNB method in 50 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.4 (12). When the pH optimum of

the enzymatic reaction was determined the malate dehydrogenase-coupled assay was used (13). Protein concentrations were determined using gel electrophoresis and the method of Lowry et al. (14). Polyacrylamide Coomassie staining were done according to the procedure of Laemmli (15). A fraction enriched in yeast mitochondrial inner membrane was prepared as described by Brent and Srere (10). Mitochondrial CS was prepared as described by Alam et al. (9). K,,, values of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate for CS2 was determined using the entire progress curve of the reaction with one limiting substrate and the other in excess (16, 17). Reaction rate values were obtained as tangents to the curves at five different times which correspond to five different substrate concentrations. The total substrate concentration was determined by adding one unit pig heart CS to the reaction mixture. The Ki values for ATP, ADP, and AMP were determined using acetylcoenzyme A as the limiting substrate and the inhibitor at different concentrations. The Ki values were obtained by plotting the apparent Km values for acetyl-CoA at different inhibitor concentrations against the inhibitor concentration. For competitive inhibition the X axis intercept is -K; (18). The effect of pH on the CS2 activity was measured at room temperature in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.1 and 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA in the absence and presence of 0.2 mM oxaloacetate. The remaining activity was measured after the incubation. The heat inactivation of CS2 at 40°C was measured in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 mM EDTA. Aliquots were withdrawn at various times during the incubation and the enzyme activity was determined. HPLC-gel filtration was done using a Bio-Sil TSK400 column and Waters HPLC equipment. The column was calibrated with a standard mixture (Bio-Rad) containing bovine thyroglobulin, y-globulin, chicken ovalbumin, horse myoglobin, and vitamin B12.

cm) until CS activity appeared in the breakthrough fraction. The column was then washed with 200 ml buffer A containing 50 mM KCl. A linear gradient from 50 to 250 mM KC1 in buffer A was used to elute the enzyme. The enzyme appeared between 110 and 150 mM KC1 in a single peak. Fractions containing significant CS activity were pooled and concentrated on a DIAFLO ultrafiltration unit (Amicon) using PM10 membranes. The sample was also equilibrated with buffer A by dilution/ concentration cycles using the same device. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 50% to the equilibrated concentrated sample and stored at 4°C until further use. A pool of the fractions from the Step 3: Blue dye chromatography. ion exchange column which contained enzyme activity was applied to a 50.ml Reactive blue cross-linked agarose (300 CL Sigma) column (2.5 X 10 cm) and washed first with buffer A containing 20% glycerol and 0.5 mM oxaloacetate, then thoroughly washed with buffer A containing 20% glycerol, and thereafter with 0.5 mM CoA in the same buffer, and finally with buffer A containing glycerol. The enzyme was eluted with 0.5 mM oxaloacetate + 0.5 mM CoA in buffer A containing 20% glycerol. The fractions containing CS activity were pooled, concentrated, and equilibrated on the ultrafiltration device with buffer A containing glycerol. The glycerol concentration was adjusted to 50%, and the enzyme was stored at 4°C. A summary of a purification procedure is shown in Table I.

of CS to mitochondrial membranes was assayed in 50 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA according to the procedures of Brent and Srere (10). Mixtures of mitochondrial membranes and CS were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 25,000g for 20 min. The supernatant solution was carefully removed and the pellet resuspended in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and 1% Triton X-100. Both supernatant solution and pellet suspension were assayed for CS activity. In all cases all the added CS was recovered.

Purified CS2 was subjected to HPLC gel filtration. Approximately 95% of the added protein eluted in one peak at the n/l, of 100,000 (data not shown). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed one major band with M, 50,000 (Fig. 1). Gel filtration showed minor impurities amounting to less than 5% of the applied protein. Under some conditions of HPLC gel filtration of CS2 two bands were seen. One with enzyme activity at 100,000 M, and one inactive band at 50,000 M,. This behavior was not observed with pig heart CS. Rechromatography of the 100 K M, band showed the presence again of the 50 K M, component. Stability The enzyme lost its activity in a few days if it was stored in buffer A at 4°C -2O"C, or -7O'C.

Expression of CS2 in PSY142 CSl- Cells
To simplify the purification of CS2 the CS2 gene was cloned into a multicopy yeast shuttle vector, pK10, which was introduced into a PSY 142 CSl- cell. The CS2 activity of the cells increased from 20 ? 5 to 90 + 8 mU/mg protein in the CSl- cells after the transformation. PSY142 CSl-/CS2 pKl0 cells were grown in minimal medium containing 2% galactose and lysine (20 pg/ml) to late log phase and harvested by centrifugation at 2000s for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed with ice cold distilled water. All subsequent steps were carried out at 0-4°C.

No significant differences were found between these parameters obtained in CSl- in CSl- + CSB/pKlO cell free lysates or in the isolated enzyme (Table II). The pH optimum was determined in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer containing 1 mM EDTA using the malate dehydrogenase-coupled assay. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme, and an optimum of pH 8 was found (Fig. 4). The activity dropped sharply at pH values less than 7.5 and greater than pH 8.5. The inhibition of CS activity by several different metabolites was measured with the DTNB method using 10 pM AcCoA and 50 PM oxaloacetate (Table II). Glucose 6P (10 mM) and NAD+ (10 mM) had no effect on these enzymes. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate (10 mM), fructose 2,6diphosphate (0.5 mM), and NADP+ had a small effect on CS2 activity while the inhibition of CSl was marginal. NADH (5 mM) inhibited CS2 by 51% while the CSl activity decreased only 12%. NADPH (5 mM) inhibited both enzymes by approximately 40%. For both CSl and CS2 the inhibitory strength of the adenine nucleotides decreased from ATP to ADP and AMP. However, the ADP and AMP inhibition on CS2 was apparently greater than

that of CSl with AMP having no effect on CSl (Table III); it should be noted that the K, for acetyl-CoA for CS2 is higher than that for CSl and that may account for this difference and the fixed acetyl-CoA concentration. The Ki values for ATP, AMP, and NADH was determined with AcCoA and oxaloacetate concentrations of 50 and 200 PM, respectively. These inhibitions were competitive (data not shown). The K,,, value of CS2 was determined using the progress curve method described above at different inhibitor concentrations. The apparent K,,, values for acetyl-CoA were plotted against the inhibitor concentration, and the Ki was determined (18). The KiS for ATP, AMP, and NADH obtained this way were 1.1, 11, and 25 mM (Fig. 5). Neither glyoxylate nor succinate had an inhibitory effect on a partially purified CS2 at limiting oxaloacetate concentration (data not shown). Binding to Mitochondrial Inner Membranes

SRERE TABLE IV CS Enzymes to the Inner Membrane Bound

CSl and pig heart CS had a high affinity toward yeast mitochondrial inner membranes as reported earlier (10). On the other hand, no binding of CS2 was observed (Table IV). Location of CS2 in Situ We have attempted to isolate microbodies from osmotically ruptured yeast spheroplasts. On occasion we have observed sedimentation of CS2 between 10,000 and 100,OOOg.Using ordinary cell disruption techniques CS2 has always appeared as a soluble enzyme (data not shown). DISCUSSION Our initial attempts to isolate the nonmitochondrial CS isoenzyme (CS2) from PSY142 CSl- cells failed because of the low activity of CS2 and the instability of the enzyme. To overcome this problem CSl- cells were transformed with a multicopy plasmid carrying the CS2 gene. The transformation resulted in approximately fivefold overexpression of CS2. In addition, we found the CS2 could be stabilized using 50% glycerol. The isolation of the enzyme was based on streptomycin treatment, ion exchange chromatography, and blue dye/ agarose chromatography. This procedure resulted in CS2 with 95% purity with 11.2% yield. The molecular weight of the enzyme was about 100,000 determined by gel filtration and 50,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pig citrate synthase has a subunit molecular weight of 48,969 based on a 437-amino acid peptide chain by amino acid sequencing methodology (19) which has been confirmed from its cDNA sequence (20). The mature CS2 enzyme is estimated by gel filtration methods to be about 2 kDa smaller than the preenzyme (from DNA sequence 53,500; observed 54,000) with a molecular mass of 52 kDa. The product of the open reading frame of the DNA for CS2 represents a protein with an M, of 51,400 (4). However, on SDS gels it would appear to be smaller than this at about M, 49-50 K. This indicates that a proteolytic cleavage may have occurred. Whether this difference is due to an artifact of isolation or as a physiological cleavage upon transport into an organelle cannot be established with this data. The citrate synthase of the glyoxylate cycle of two other cell types has been purified and studied. Zehler et al. (1) has shown that the glyoxysomal (peroxisomal) CS of castor bean seeds is different from the mitochondrial enzyme of that tissue. The CSl and CS2 enzymes were similar in pH stability, temperature stability, size (dimer of about 47 kDa subunits), and pH optima. They differed in respect to their isoelectric points (CSl p1 5.9; CS2 p1 9.1) and their behavior on ATP-Sepharose. Sautter et al. (2) purified glyoxysomal (peroxisomal) citrate synthase from watermelon cotyledons. This enzyme was inhibited by DTNB while the mitochondrial CS was not affected by DTNB. Similar inhibition by

Note. CS enzyme was incubated with 0.1 mg yeast mitochondrial membrane in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA for 15 min at room temperature. Mitochondrial membranes were isolated by centrifugation (25,OOOgfor 20 min). The enzyme activity was measured both in the pellet and in the supernatant solution. Values are the averages of three determinations + SD.

DTNB of CS from mango (21) and tomato (22) has been reported. The subunit size of watermelon CS2 was reported as 48 kDa on a gel that showed pig CSl with a molecular mass of 45 kDa (actual M, = 49,000). In a cell free translation system antibodies for watermelon CS2 precipitated a protein with a molecular mass of 51 kDa, which indicates that processing of this enzyme occurs. Watermelon CS2 showed a Ki for ATP of 2.6 mM while watermelon CSl showed a Ki for ATP of 0.33 mM. Both the castor bean CS2 and the watermelon cotyledon CS2 have been located in the peroxisomes (glyoxysomes) of those tissues. The question of processing of peroxisomal (glyoxysomal) enzymes upon their transport into the organelles is still an open one (23). Some enzymes seem to be transported without the presence and cleavage of a signal sequence whereas others have been said to require a signal sequence for transport. For most plants the presence of citrate synthase in glyoxysomes (peroxisomes) is a well-established fact which was noted by Breidenbach and Beevers (24) in the first reports about this pathway in plants. When yeast cells containing peroxisomal citrate synthase are disrupted by osmotic shock, CS2 appears in a high speed (35,000g) supernatant fraction. An earlier report by Duntze et al. (25) reported similar results. However, recently Lewin et al. (6) and McCammon et al. (7) have shown in S. cerevzkiae that CS2 can be partially found in a fraction which contain peroxisomal marker enzymes as well as glyoxylate cycle enzymes. It should also be noted that the carboxyl terminal sequence of CS2 (4) is serine-lysine-leucine. This sequence is considered to be a signal sequence for transport of proteins into the peroxisomes (26). CS2 is a much more labile enzyme than CSl. CS2 lost its activity when stored without glycerol, incubated at pH 8.1, or after heat treatment at 40°C. The protective effect of oxaloacetate could be demonstrated against pH and heat inactivation. CSl is perfectly stable at pH 8.1 and

loses its activity much more slowly at 40°C than does CS2 (4). Our observations on the apparent dissociation of CS2 during gel filtration may explain its decreased stability. The kinetic behaviors of CSl and CS2 are similar. The fact that the K,,, values for oxaloacetate and AcCoA which were the same for the CS2 present in CSl-CSB/pKlO cells and for the isolated enzyme show the reliability of the kinetic methods used and also indicates that in each case the same CS2 was examined. The inhibitory effect of several possible regulatory metabolites on CSl and CS2 was determined. Of those tested, only NADH, ADP, and AMP had a greater effect on CS2 than CSl. The other interactions were not remarkable. No consistent regulatory hypothesis can be drawn from these effects of putative metabolite regulators on CS2 from yeast or from other tissues. We have observed that Krebs cycle cytosolic isozymes do not bind to inner mitochondrial membranes as do their mitochondrial counterparts (see (27) for review). We have now observed that citrate synthase is no exception to this rule, and this we believe adds further evidence to the idea that a complex of Krebs tricarboxylic cycle enzymes is the efficient operating mode in the mitochondrial matrix.
