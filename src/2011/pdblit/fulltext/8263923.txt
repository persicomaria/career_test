NUCLEOSIDE DIPHOSPHATE KINASE FROM A R T E M I A EMBRYOS
MARGARITA F. RENART,* JAIME RENART* and ANTONIO SILLERO~" *Instituto de Enzimologia y Patologia Molecular del CSIC, Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Aut6noma, Madrid-34, Spain, and ~'Departamento de Bioquimica Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain (Received 31 October 1983) Abstract--1. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC. 2.7.4.6) has been purified 1900-foldwith 17% yield from Artemia dormant embryos. 2. The purified enzyme exhibits a ping-pong mechanism of reaction. The calculated K~ values for ADP, GTP, ITP, UTP and CTP are 0.04, 0.17, 0.25, 0.27 and 0.62raM, respectively. 3. The role of this enzyme in the conversion of diguanosine tetraphosphate into ATP is also discussed. Maximum velocity of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (50 U/g dry cysts) is well in excess (around thousand-fold) over the enzymes which transform diguanosine tetraphosphate into AMP.

INTRODUCTION Artemia dormant embryos (cysts) have unusually high amounts (ca 10raM) of diguanosine 5',5"-P t, P4-tetraphosphate (Gp4 G) which are used up during development as a source of both adenine and guanine nucleotides (Clegg et al., 1967, Renart, 1975). The enzyme responsible for its degradation is dinucleosidetetraphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.17) described and characterized by Warner and Finamore (1965) and Vallejo et al. (1974). This enzyme splits Gp4G and gives GTP and GMP as products. We have investigated the molecular and kinetic properties of the enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway leading from G M P to AMP: GMP reductase (EC 1.6.6.8), (Renart et al., 1976), adenyiosuccinate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.4), (Faraldo et al., 1983) and adenylosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.2), (Pinto et al., 1983). To extend the information about this metabolic pathway, leading to the conversion of guanine nucleotides into adenine nucleotides in Artemia embryos, we present the characterization of nucleoside diphosphate kinase which catalyzes the phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates to nucleoside triphosphates.
MATERIALS

sample, in 2 ml, contained 560 A260units of GTP (Sigma) and 3 #Ci of [3H]-GDP used as marker, in distilled water. Upon application of the sample, a linear gradient of 21 between 0.12 and 0.18 M NH4HCO3, pH 8.6, was applied. Fractions of 8.3 ml were collected and checked for absorbance at 260 nm and radioactivity. Fractions 110-145, that contained GTP were pooled and concentrated in a rotary evaporator. After several washes with distilled water, the final product was dissolved in 1.5 ml of distilled water. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase was assayed in a final volume of 1 ml containing, unless otherwise indicated: 50 mM imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCI, 5 mM MgClv 0.1 mM DTE, 1 mM glucose, 2mM NADPH, 0.5U hexokinase, 0.5 U glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, l mM GTP, 0.4mM ADP and sumcient extract to give 0.01-0.015 U of nucleoside diphosphate kinase. When indicated, other nucleoside triphosphates were used as phosphate donors. The increase in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored in a Gilford 2400 or Varian 635 spectrophotometers. 1 unit is the amount of enzyme that transforms 1 #mole of substrate/min at 30°C. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (1951) using bovine serum albumin as standard. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Subcellular localization o f nucleoside diphosphate kinase In a first attempt to purify the enzyme, we have studied its subcellular localization. 10 g of cysts were homogenized as described in Materials and Methods. After filtering through glass wool, the soluble extract was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 7 min to obtain the nuclear fraction; then at 13,000 × g for 20min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction; the postmitochondrial supernatant was then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 hr to obtain the microsomal and cytosolic fractions. All pellets were resuspended in the appropriate amounts of 50mM imidazole, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCI, 5 mM MgC12, 0.1 mM DTE (buffer M). Nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity in the nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal and cytosolic fractions was around 1, 3, 9 and 86% of that found in the total homogenate respectively. It is clear,

AND METHODS

Nucleotides were from Sigma Co. and Waidhof. Nicotine adenine dinucleotides were from Boehringer-Mannheim. Auxiliary enzymes were from Sigma. Artemia cysts were from Long Fish Food Products, Ontario, Canada, and were from the Salt Lake (Utah) strain. Cysts were treated and washed as previously described (Renart and Sillero, 1974) and were homogenized in 10 ml of 0.035 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.7, 0.07 M KC1, 0.009 M MgCI2, 0.0001 M dithiothreitol (DTE), 0.25 M sucrose (buffer A) per gram of dry cysts by agitation at 500 rpm in a magnetic stirrer for 2-3 hr. Commercial GTP was purified from contaminant GDP by DEAE-cellulose chromatography as follows: a DEAEcellulose column (42.5 x 2.2 cm) was equilibrated with 1 M (NH4)2CO 3 and then washed with distilled water.

Purification of nucleoside diphosphate kinase
In a typical purification run, 20 g of dry cysts were homogenized as described with 200 ml of buffer A plus 5 m M 2-mercaptoethanol. The soluble extract was obtained as described above. Ammonium sulphate fractionation. A quantity of 29.1 g of solid a m m o n i u m sulphate per 100 ml (50% saturation) were added to the soluble extract. After stirring for 30 rain at 4'~C, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 30 min in the SS-34 Sorvall rotor and the pellet discarded. The supernatant was brought to 9 0 ~ saturation by adding 26.8 g solid a m m o n i u m sulphate per 100 ml. After stirring and centrifuging, the pellet was saved and resuspended in 8 ml of buffer M. (Fraction I). Ethanol precipitation. Ethanol (prechilled at - 2 0 ° C ) was added to Fraction I up to 40%. The solution was kept at - 2 0 ° C for 12hr and then centrifuged at 27,000 x g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant dialyzed against buffer M for 5 hr. A slight pellet after dialysis was eliminated by centrifugation as above (Fraction II). Sephadex G-lOOfiltration. Fraction II (20 ml) was applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (91 x 2.6cm)

equilibrated in buffer M. Elution was done with the same buffer collecting fractions of 8.3 ml. The fractions that contained the activity (23-29) were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 m M 2-mercaptoethanol (Fraction

III).
Hydroxyapatite chromatography. Fraction III was applied to an hydroxyapatite column (19.5 × 1.8 cm) equilibrated in the potassium phosphate buffer above described. The ratio between the a m o u n t of protein (mg) to the volume of the column must be around 10 in order to get a good yield. After application of the sample, the column was washed with the same buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm of the effluent was near zero, and then eluted with a linear gradient composed of 250 ml of 10 m M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 m M 2-mercaptoethanol and 250 ml of 4 0 0 m M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 m M 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 0 m M E D T A (Fig. 1.). Fractions 151-200, that contained the activity, were concentrated 100-fold by ultrafiltration with an Amicon PM-30 membrane (Fraction IV). Nucleoside diphosphate kinase was stored with 50% (v/v) glycerol at - 2 0 ° C , conditions in which it is stable for at least 3 months. Table 1 shows the results of this purification. The

GTP (variable substrate) varied from 0.05 to 0.2 mM. B. Same type of experiment, but using higher concentrations of the variable substrate UTP, from 0.5 to 2.0 mM. Concentrations of the fixed substrate ADP are: (a) 1 mM; (b) 2 mM; (c) 3 mM. C. Inhibition by excess of variable substrate (ADP). The concentrations of the fixed substrate GTP were: (a) 0.25 raM; (b) 0.2 mM; (c) 0.1 mM. yield is 17% with a purification of 190()-fold. The enzyme from Fraction IV is essentially free of adenylate kinase, which would interfere with the assay used. showed that as the concentration of fixed substrate (GTP) was raised, higher concentrations of the variable substrate were needed to get the same inhibition (Fig. 3C) (Cleland, 1963). (b) Product inhibition patterns. In a ping-pong mechanism, when the product combines with a different enzyme form that the variable substrate, a non-competitive inhibition is observed. That was the case when G D P was used as inhibitory product and GTP and A D P as variable and fixed substrates respectively (Fig. 4). On the other hand, if the inhibitory product reacts with the same enzyme form as the variable substrate, the inhibition is competitive. This type of inhibition was obtained when GDP was the inhibitor and A D P the variable substrate (results not shown). (c) Dead-end inhibition. When an inhibitory compound is not a substrate or product but can react with both forms of the enzyme, a dead-end enzymeinhibitor complex is formed. This happened when G M P was used as inhibitor. The inhibition observed was non-competitive, both for GTP or A D P as fixed substrates (Figs 5A, B). However, if both substrates are varied in a fixed ratio (1:2), a competitive inhibition was observed (Fig. 5C). The results show that, as happens with the enzyme from other sources (Garces and Cleland, 1969), purified nucleoside diphosphate kinase from Arternia also presents a ping-pong mechanism of reaction. The K m values determined for ADP, GTP, ITP, UTP and CTP were 0.04, 0.17, 0.25, 0.27 and 0.62mM respectively.

Kinetics of nucleoside diphosphate kinase. All experiments were done with enzyme from Fraction IV, and all lines were fitted using the leastsquares method. (a) Initial velocity patterns. When both substrates (GTP and ADP) are varied and the initial velocities represented in a Lineweaver-Burk plot, an array of parallel lines was obtained (Fig. 2). A similar pattern resulted when UTP instead of GTP was used as donor substrate (data not shown). This result is characteristic of a ping-pong mechanism. This was authenticated with the experiments described below. At higher substrate levels, competitive substrate inhibition by the fixed substrate (ADP) could be demonstrated (Fig. 3A). Measurements of initial velocities at inhibitory concentrations of the fixed substrate and at increasing concentrations of the variable one, showed that the inhibition was only observed at low concentrations of the variable substrate (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, when the fixed substrate was held at non-inhibitory concentrations and inhibition was tested with the variable one, the pattern obtained

Involvement of nucleoside diphosphate kinase in the utilization of Gp4G. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase would then be able to phosphorylate A D P using GTP as donor substrate, which is one of the primary products of dinucleosidetetraphosphatase. The A D P needed could be generated from G M P through the pathway outlined in the introduction. In this respect it could be mentioned that nucleoside diphosphate kinase is well in excess (50U/g dry cysts) over the other enzymes that transform GpaG into AMP, dinucleosidetetraphosphatase, G M P reductase, adenylosuccinate synthetase and adenylosuccinate lyase, which have maximum velocities in the order of 30-80 mU/g dry cysts (Vallejo et al., 1974, Renart et al., 1976, Faraldo et al., 1983, Pinto et al., 1983).

Van Denbos and Finamore (1974) have proposed an alternative pathway in which an intermediate of the type Ap4G is formed. This c o m p o u n d would be hydrolyzed by the tetraphosphatase to yield A T P and G M P . However, some of the enzymes proposed have not been found, and moreover, it is not known whether the tetraphosphatase could recognize differentially the two bases of its substrate; the broad specificity of dinucleosidetetraphosphatase towards the bases (Vallejo et al., 1976) makes, however, this differential recognition unlikely. We think that the pathway proposed here is easier and more likely to be functional in vivo. Garces and Cleland (1969) have shown that nucleoside diphosphate kinase from yeast is very efficient, its rate constants being close to the limit set by diffusion; so, if the A r t e m i a enzyme is similar in this respect, G T P would be a very efficient
