ABSTRACT Human acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) is a member of the -trefoil superfold, a protein architecture that exhibits a characteristic threefold axis of structural symmetry. FGF-1 contains 11 -turns, the majority being type I 3:5; however, a type I 4:6 turn is also found at three symmetryrelated locations. The relative uniqueness of the type I 4:6 turn in the FGF-1 structure suggests it may play a key role in the stability, folding, or function of the protein. To test this hypothesis a series of deletion mutations were constructed, the aim of which was to convert existing type I 4:6 turns at two locations into type I 3:5 turns. The results show it is possible to successfully substitute the type I 4:6 turn by a type I 3:5 turn with minimal impact upon protein stability or folding. Thus, these different turn structures, even though they differ in length, exhibit similar energetic properties. Additional sequence swapping mutations within the introduced type I 3:5 turns suggests that the turn sequence primarily affects stability but not turn structure (which appears dictated primarily by the local environment). Although the results suggest that a stable, foldable -trefoil protein may be designed utilizing a single turn type (type I 3:5), a type I 4:6 turn at turn 1 of FGF-1 appears essential for efficient mitogenic function.

main-chain , angles. If a -turn connects two -strands that form an antiparallel -sheet, then it is known as a -hairpin turn. Thornton and coworkers3 developed an "X:Y" shorthand for -hairpin structures whereby X identifies the number of residues required for the turn and Y identifies the hydrogen bonding pattern in the closure of the turn (X equals Y when the closure involves two backbone hydrogen bonds, whereas Y X 2 if closure involves one hydrogen bond). Thornton noted that the number of residues in -hairpin turns typically comprises two to seven residues (X 2­7), and can be further classified according to different patterns of backbone hydrogen bonding. This complexity makes -turns a fertile area for biophysical studies of protein stability and folding. Various reports have characterized the relationship between turn residues and -hairpin formation using small peptide systems.4 ­ 8 Jimenez and coworkers9 showed that different turn sequences can alter turn conformation, and consequently, the -sheet registration of -hairpins. Conversely, Searle and coworkers10 reported that turn regions within a protein may be able to maintain their conformation despite variations in their primary structure. Rotondi and Gierasch8 have shown that two of the seven -hairpin turns in retinoic acid binding protein I form spontaneously in solution as short peptides, suggest-

Protein architectures are built up from -helical, -strand, and turn secondary structure motifs. Among these secondary structures, -turns are the most common type of nonrepetitive structure recognized in proteins, and comprise about 25% of the residues.1 Despite this abundance, less is understood regarding the contribution of turns to the structure, stability, and folding of proteins than for -helices and -sheets. One reason for this lack of knowledge is that -turns appear to be far more varied and complex than either -helices or -sheets. Richardson and coworkers2 have characterized the -turn as having six distinct types (I, I , II, II , VIa, and VIb), as well as a miscellaneous category (IV), based on

ing that local sequence may determine some turn structures, while others may be influenced more by the local structural environment. Related to this issue, sequenceswapping mutations in FGF-1, for turn regions that differ in structure, do not result in conformation swapping; suggesting that turn conformation in proteins is influenced more by the local environment than by the turn sequence itself.11 Thus, turn structure, stability and folding are complicated issues involving interplay between turn sequence and the local structural environment; however, predicable effects of turn mutations upon protein stability and folding are beginning to emerge. In some cases, specific polar interactions between residues i and i 2 in type I 3:5 turns have been implicated in stabilization of the turn structure.8 In reference to Ala, a Gly residue at the i 3 position in type I 3:5 and 4:6 turns (where the i 3 residue is located in the L- region of the Ramachandran plot) has been shown in several different proteins to stabilize the structure by 7.3 1.4 kJ/mol.12 However, much work remains to be done to elucidate the relationship between turn sequence and the local structural environment upon turn structure, stability, and folding. Human acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) has a total of 12 -strands connected by a series of 11 -turns characteristic of the -trefoil superfold (Fig. 1). Five of these turns (turns 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10; Fig. 1) are classical -hairpin turns ( -turns that connect antiparallel -sheet secondary structure and form a terminal interstrand hydrogen bond). Among these, turns 2, 6, and 10 are related by the threefold structural symmetry of the -trefoil architecture. Similarly, turns 4 and 8 are related by the threefold structural symmetry (with the N- and Ctermini comprising a symmetry-related "discontinuous" turn; Fig. 1). With the exception of turn 4 (which is a type

VIba turn), all of these turns in FGF-1 are type I 3:5 turns. The type I turn is defined by the characteristic main chain angles of the i 1 and i 2 residues within the turn (turn residue i 1 60°, 30°; and turn residue i 2 90°, 0°), and the 3:5 nomenclature indicates that there are three residues comprising the turn, and the residues that close off the turn do so via a single main chain hydrogen bond.3 Turns 3, 7, and 11 are also type I 3:5 -turns (and also related by the threefold structural symmetry), but the connecting secondary structure is not an antiparallel -sheet (Fig. 1). Turns 1, 5, and 9 are unique in being type I 4:6 -turns (i.e., containing four instead of three residues within the turn). The -strands that turns 1 and 5 connect do not primarily hydrogen bond with each other: they diverge almost immediately after the turn, and in each case, contain only a single additional interstrand hydrogen bond before diverging (Fig. 1). Thus, there is some question as to whether -turns 1 and 5 should be considered as true -hairpin structures. Turn 9 (symmetry-related to turns 1 and 5) exhibits a structural distortion, due to an apparent three amino acid insertion after the turn (Fig. 1), that eliminates any consideration of it being a -hairpin type of turn. This description of the -turns present in FGF-1 highlights the fact that the predominant turn type is a type I 3:5, but that type I 4:6 turns are present at characteristic symmetry-related positions within the protein architecture. Why are the type I 4:6 turns found exclusively at this particular structural location, and can the FGF-1 architecture be simplified by the utilization of a single turn type (i.e., type I 3:5) at every position where a -turn is required? To answer this question we have investigated the effects upon the structure, stability, folding, and mitogenic function of FGF-1 mutations designed to convert the type I 4:6 turns into type I 3:5 at both turn 1 and turn 5

locations. The results show that the type I 3:5 turn can potentially be utilized at every location in FGF-1 requiring a -turn, and produce a stable, foldable polypeptide. The results also suggest that the turn structure in FGF-1 is likely determined by a combination of the length of the turn and the nature of the local turn environment; variations in the turn sequence are unlikely to alter the turn structure, but have an important contribution to the turn stability. Finally, the type I 4:6 turn appears to be important at the turn 1 location in FGF-1 for efficient receptorbinding and mitogenic function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mutagenesis and Expression All studies utilized a synthetic gene for the 140 amino acid form of human FGF-113­16 containing an additional amino-terminal six His tag as previously described.17 The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce all point mutations and deletions, and confirmed by nucleic acid sequence analysis (Biomolecular Analysis Synthesis and Sequencing Laboratory, Florida State University). All expression and purification followed previously published procedures.17 Purified protein was exchanged into 20 mM N-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid (ADA), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, pH 6.60 ("ADA buffer") for biophysical studies or 50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5 ("crystallization buffer") for crystallization. Crystallization of FGF-1 Mutants Purified protein in crystallization buffer was concentrated to 9 ­13 mg/mL and crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Diffraction quality crystals of G19, G19/ E60 and S17T/N18T/ G19 mutants grew in 1 week at room temperature with 1 mL of reservoir solution containing 2.0 ­3.5 M sodium formate and 0.9 ­1.0 M ammonium sulfate in the crystallization buffer. E60 crystals grew within 1 week at room temperature in 10 L hanging drops by vapor diffusion against 2% of PEG 400, 0.1 M Na-HEPES, 2 M (NH4)2SO4. Data Collection, Molecular Replacement, and Refinement Diffraction data for G19, E60, and S17T/N18T/ G19 mutants were collected using a Rigaku RU-H2R copper rotating anode ( 1.54 Å) X-ray generator (Rigaku MSC, The Woodlands, TX) coupled to a Osmic Blue or a Purple confocal mirror system (Osmic, Auburn Hills, MI) and to an R-Axis IIc image plate (Rigaku MSC, The Woodlands, TX) or a MarCCD165 charge-coupled device detector (Mar USA, Evanston, IL). Diffraction data collection for G19/ E60 was collected at Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-BM beamline ( 1.00 Å) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory using a MarCCD225 charge-coupled device detector (Mar USA, Evanston, IL). In each case, crystals were mounted using Hampton Research nylon mounted cryoturns and frozen in a stream of gaseous nitrogen at 100 K.

Diffraction data were indexed, integrated and scaled using the DENZO software package.18,19 His-tagged wild-type FGF-1 (PDB code: 1JQZ) was used as the search model in molecular replacement of the G19 and E60 mutant structures, and the refined G19 structure was used as the search model in molecular replacement of the G19/ E60 and S17T/N18T/ G19 mutant structures, using the Crystallography and NMR System software.20 Model building and visualization utilized the O molecular graphics program.21 Isothermal Equilibrium Chemical Denaturation Protein denaturation was monitored by following the fluorescence signal of the single endogenous Trp residue at position 107, which is 90% buried in the native structure.16 Complete details of the instrumentation, data collection, and analysis procedure have been previously reported.22 Briefly, the fluorescence signal of FGF-1 is atypical in that Trp107 exhibits greater quenching in the native state rather than the denatured state. Excitation at 295 nm provides selective excitation of Trp107 in comparison with the six Tyr residues that are present in the structure.17,22 Protein samples (10 to 5 M) in various concentrations of GuHCl/ADA buffer were allowed to equilibrate overnight at room temperature (298 K). Fluorescence scans were collected in triplicate and averaged; buffer traces were collected and subsequently subtracted from the protein scans. All scans were integrated to quantitate the total fluorescence as a function of denaturant concentration. The data was analyzed using a general purpose nonlinear least-squares fitting program (DataFit, Oakdale Engineering, Oakdale, PA) implementing a six parameter, two-state model:23 F F0N (SN[D]) (F0D 1 e (( (SD[D]))e

where the denaturant concentration is given by [D], the native state (0 M denaturant) fluorescence intercept and slope are F0N and SN, respectively, the denatured state fluorescence intercept and slope are F0D and SD, respectively, and the free energy of unfolding function intercept and slope are G0 and m, respectively. The G0 and m-values describe the linear function of the free energy of unfolding as a function of denaturant under isothermal equilibrium conditions (where G0 is the G value extrapolated to 0 M denaturant, and m-value is reported as d G/d[D]). The midpoint of the transition, that is, the denaturant concentration where G 0, is defined as Cm. The effect of a given mutation upon the stability of the protein ( G) was calculated by taking the difference between the Cm values for wild-type and mutant and multiplying by the average of the m values, as described by Pace and Scholtz:24 G (Cmwild type Cmmutant)(mwild type mmutant)/2 (2)

where a negative value indicates the mutation is stabilizing in relationship to the wild-type protein.

Unfolding Kinetic Measurements Native protein samples were dialyzed against ADA buffer overnight at 298 K. Unfolding was initiated by a 1:10 dilution of 25 M protein into ADA buffer with concentrations of GuHCl varying between 1.5 to 4.5 M. The fluorescence signal associated with protein unfolding was quantified using a Varian Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer, with a wavelength of 295 nm for excitation and 350 nm for emission, and maintained at 298 K with a temperature-controlled Peltier cell holder (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The unfolding kinetics exhibited relaxation times that were appropriate for manual mixing techniques. The data collection strategy was designed to span approximately two to three half-lives, or 80% of the expected fluorescence signal change between the fully native and denatured states. Folding Kinetic Measurements Kinetic measurements followed a previously described methodology.11,12,25,26 Briefly, denatured protein samples were dialyzed overnight against ADA buffer containing 2.5 M GuHCl. Initial studies using manual mixing indicated that the relaxation times for the folding process were more appropriate for stopped-flow data collection. All folding kinetic data was collected using a Kintek SF2000 stoppedflow system (Kintek Corp., Austin, TX). Folding was initiated by a 1:10 dilution of 40 M denatured protein into ADA buffer with denaturant concentrations varying from 0.25 M GuHCl to the midpoint of denaturation (as determined by the above-described isothermal equilibrium denaturation measurements) in increments of 0.05 M. The data collection strategy was designed to span approximately five half-lives, or 97% of the expected fluorescence signal change between the fully denatured and native states. Kinetic Analysis Both folding and unfolding kinetic data was collected in triplicate at each denaturant concentration, with typically six runs per sample and all data being averaged. The kinetic rate constants and amplitudes, as a function of denaturant concentration, were determined from the timedependent change in fluorescence intensity implementing a single exponential model: It Aexp( kt) C (3)

Folding and unfolding rate constant data were fit to a global function describing the contribution of both rate constants to the observed kinetics as a function of denaturant ("Chevron" plot) as described by Fersht:27 ln(kobs) ln(kf0exp(mfD) ku0 exp(muD)) (5)

where kf0 and ku0 are the folding and unfolding rate constants, respectively, extrapolated to 0 M denaturant, mf and mu are the slopes of the linear functions relating ln(kf) and ln(ku), respectively, to denaturant concentration, and D is denaturant concentration. The fast unfolding rate constant, in the low denaturant regime of folding, is included in the global fit.12 The change in the G of unfolding ( G) in response to a mutation was determined from the kinetic data using Equation (2) and the following definitions: ku0 kf0 mf mu ln RT(mf mu)

where I(t) is the intensity of fluorescent signal at time t, A is the corresponding amplitude, k is the observed rate constant for the reaction, and C is a constant corresponding to the asymptotic signal limit. As previously described,12 FGF-1 exhibits single exponential unfolding behavior throughout the entire range of denaturant concentration; however, folding in low concentrations ( 0.6 M) of denaturant exhibits a fast and slow phase. The folding data in the low denaturant concentration regime is therefore fit using a biexponential model: It A1exp( k1t) A2exp( k2t) C (4)

The mitogenic activity of FGF-1 mutants, as quantified using an NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell proliferation assay, followed previously published procedures.26 Briefly, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were initially plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum (NCS) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 100 units of penicillin, 100 g of streptomycin, 0.25 g of FungizoneTM and 0.01 mg/mL of gentamicin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) ("serum-rich" medium) in T75 tissue culture flasks (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). The cultures were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. At 80% cell confluence, the cells were rinsed with 5 mL of cold TBS (0.14 M NaCl, 5.1 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 24.8 mM Trizma base, pH 7.4) and subsequently treated with 5 mL of a 0.025% trypsin solution (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Cell synchronization was initiated by serum starvation in DMEM with 0.5% NCS, 100 units of penicillin, 100 g of streptomycin, 0.25 g of FungizoneTM and 0.01 mg/mL of gentamicin ("starvation" medium). The cells were seeded in T25 tissue culture flasks (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) at a cell density of 3.0 104 cells/cm2 (representing 20% confluence). Duplicate flasks were incubated for 48 h at 37°C, the medium supplemented with the appropriate concentration of FGF-1 protein, and incubated for an additional 48 h. After this incubation, the medium was decanted and the cells were washed with 1 mL of cold TBS (pH 7.4). One milliliter of 0.025% trypsin was then added to release the cells from the flask surface, and 2 mL of serum-rich medium were added to dilute and inhibit the trypsin. The cells were counted using a hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific Partnership, Horsham, PA). Experiments were performed in quadruplicate and the cell densities were averaged. The relationship between the cell number and log concentration of added growth factor was fit to a sigmoid function.

RESULTS The molecular architecture of FGF-1, a member of the -trefoil superfold, comprises primarily a -strand and -turn secondary structure and essentially no -helix.16,28 With two exceptions, the -hairpin turns in FGF-1 are type I 3:5 (i 1 60°, 30°, i 2 90°, 0°; three residues separating the first and last residues of the turn, and a single hydrogen bond that closes the turn). The exceptions to this prevalent turn type are turns 1 and 5, which are type I 4:6 -hairpin turns (i 1 60°, 30°, i 2 90°, 0°; four residues separating the first and last residues of the turn, and a single hydrogen bond that closes the turn; note that symmetry-related turn 9 contains a type I 4:6 turn, but is not a defined -hairpin turn due to an apparent three amino acid insertion that disrupts -sheet formation12). The seemingly atypical type I 4:6 turns in FGF-1 inspired the question of whether a type I 3:5 turn at turns 1 and 5 might somehow be incompatible with stability, folding or function of FGF-1. To answer this question, a single amino acid position within turns 1 and 5 was deleted. Because the type I 4:6 and 3:5 turns differ in the number of residue positions within the turn (with the type I 4:6 turn having an additional residue) we predicted that such a deletion would convert the type I 4:6 turns into 3:5 turns. A Gly residue at the i 3 position in both type I 3:5 and 4:6 turns has been shown to be critical for overall stability and folding of the turn when the , values fall in a

characteristic L- region (0° 90°, 0° 90°) of the Ramachandran plot.12 The Gly20 and Gly62 residues in the wild type structure are both at the i 3 position within the local type I turn, and are located within the Lregion of the Ramachandran plot; retaining the Gly20 and Gly62 residues therefore appeared essential in the turn mutation design. X-ray Structures Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained for the G19, E60, G19/ E60, and S17T/N18T/ G19 mutant proteins. The E60 and S17T/N18T/ G19 mutants crystallized in the same space group (C2221) as wild-type FGF-1 (Table I). The G19 and G19/ E60 mutants crystallized in a previously unreported P21 crystal form. Analysis of this P21 cell indicated a Matthews' coefficient of 2.8 Å3/Da with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. These four molecules were successfully positioned in the G19 cell using the molecular replacement method and wildtype FGF-1 as the search model. This initial solution was subsequently also used as a successful starting model for the refinement of the G19/ E60 double mutant. Gly19 being adjacent to Gly20 in turn 1 of the wild-type protein leads to ambiguity regarding which residue is actually being deleted when constructing a deletion mutation at this position. Analysis of the mutant X-ray structure overlaid onto the wild-type structure shows that the remaining mutant Gly C atom is 1.1 Å distal to the C

atom of Gly20 in the wild-type structure, while it is 2.7 Å distal to the C atom of Gly19; thus, the single Gly residue in the mutant structure is most closely associated with the position of Gly20, and therefore, we consider that the Gly deletion mutation represents a deletion of position 19 (i.e., G19).

Analysis of the G19 X-ray structure shows that turn 1 converts from a type I 4:6 to a type I 3:5 turn (Fig. 2). Cys16 and His21 (the residues containing the interstrand hydrogen bond that closes the turn) of the G19 mutant essentially juxtapose with the same residues in the wildtype FGF-1 structure, and the majority of the structural

alterations are limited to residue positions Ser17, Asn18, and Gly20 (residues i 1, i 2, and i 3, respectively, in the new turn structure). Asn18 exhibits the greatest structural change, shifting its C position by approximately 1.4 Å. The side chain of Asn18 also changes rotamer conformations, from trans to gauche ; however, the combination of this C positional shift and change in side chain rotamer results in the side-chain N 2 and O 1 atoms being essentially juxtaposed with the wild-type structure (Fig. 2). This structural juxtaposition maintains a hydrogen bond between the N 2 atom of Asn18 and the main chain carbonyl group of Leu111 in the local environment (not shown). The side chain of Ser17 also adopts an alternate rotamer conformation in the G19 mutant (from trans to gauche ), but this side chain in both conformers orients towards solvent and does not appear to participate in any critical hydrogen bonding interactions. Thus, although the G19 mutation converts turn 1 from a type I 4:6 to type I 3:5, key interactions involving the side chains within this turn are essentially maintained, and deletion of Gly19 does not eliminate any substantial interactions associated with this residue. The X-ray structure of the E60 mutation within turn 5 exhibits both similarities and differences in comparison to the G19 mutation within turn 1. As is the case with the turn 1 G19 structure, the deletion of residue E60 results in the conversion of turn 5 from a type I 4:6 to a type I 3:5 turn, and residue positions Ser58 and Gln63 (the residues containing the inter-strand hydrogen bond that closes the turn) exhibit minimal structural perturbation (Fig. 2). The side chain of Glu60 hydrogen bonds to solvent, and no critical hydrogen bond appears to be disrupted upon its deletion. The C of Thr59 shifts by 2.1 Å, the C of Thr61 shifts by 0.8 Å, and the C of Gly62 shifts by 0.5 Å. Thus, in both turn deletion mutations the adjacent residue on the amino-terminus side of the deletion exhibits the largest positional shift. Residue position Ser58 adopts an alter-

nate rotamer conformation, switching from trans in the wild-type structure to gauche in the E60 mutant. In forming a type I 3:5 turn, the positional shift of the main chain and side chain of residue Thr61 permits hydrogen bonding of the Thr61 N and O 1 atoms with the Ser58 O in the gauche rotamer (Fig. 2). In the wild-type structure Thr59 O 1 hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of position Gln43, whereas, in the E60 mutant, the Thr59 O 1 hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of position Gln40 (not shown). Thus, the turn 5 deletion mutation results in a significantly different hydrogenbonding arrangement within the turn (whereas, the hydrogen bonding arrangement within the turn 1 deletion mutation is essentially preserved). The structural effects of the G19/ E60 double mutant are observed to be essentially the sum of those already described for the G19 and E60 single deletion mutations. Thus, turn 1 and turn 5 appear to be isolated and independent structural environments within the FGF-1 architecture. The S17T/N18T/ G19 mutant exhibits essentially no structural perturbation when compared to the G19 mutant (Fig. 2). The side chain O 1 of the introduced Thr18 side chain forms a potential hydrogen bond with the S atom of Cys16. The substitution of Asn18 by Thr eliminates the previously described hydrogen bond between the Asn18 side chain and the main-chain carbonyl of Leu111 in the local environment. These hydrogen bonding changes do not result in any changes to the overall turn type. Isothermal Equilibrium Chemical Denaturation The "group 1" mutations in Table II are deletion mutants within the turn 1 or turn 5 regions of FGF-1 that are designed to convert the type I 4:6 turns into type I 3:5 turns. The G19 mutant is accommodated with essentially no detectable effect upon the stability of the protein. In contrast, the individual deletion mutations in turn 5 (Thr59 through Thr61) destabilize the protein 3.9 to 7.7

The stability effects of the G19/ E60 combination mutant are essentially additive, and support the independent nature of these two turns as deduced from the X-ray structure data. The "group 2" mutations in Table II are substitution mutations between turns 1 and 5 within the G19 or E60 background proteins (i.e., with type I 3:5 turns at the turn 1 or turn 5 locations). These mutations are designed to probe the effects upon stability when interconverting the turn 1 and turn 5 amino acid sequences. In the first set of mutations within this group, the primary structure of turn 5 is being substituted into turn 1. Combined substitutions at the i 1 and i 2 positions (mutations Ser17Thr and Asn18Thr, respectively) in turn 1 are observed to destabilize the G19 mutant background by 2.4 kJ/mol. Inclusion of the Cys16Ser mutation (at the i position in the turn) renders the protein insoluble (presumably due to the substantial destabilization reported for this point mutation in the wild-type protein)29. Similarly, combined substitutions at the i 1 and i 2 positions (mutations Thr59Ser and Thr61Asn, respectively) in turn 5 are observed to destabilize the E60 mutant background by 1.0 kJ/mol. Inclusion of the Ser58Cys mutation (at the i position in the turn) destabilizes the protein an additional 1.4 kJ/mol. Folding and Unfolding Kinetic Parameters The mutant folding and unfolding kinetic parameters are listed in Table III. There is generally good agreement between the G values derived from the folding and unfolding rate constants and those determined from the isothermal equilibrium denaturation studies (Table II). Thus, the two-state assumption utilized in these analyses appears valid for each mutant. The G19 mutation is associated with an increase in both the rate of folding and unfolding, such that the overall effect upon stability is

minimal; thus, this mutation appears to have stabilized the transition state.27 The E60 mutation has minimal effect upon the rate of folding, but increases the rate of unfolding, indicating a modest destabilization of the native structure (Fig. 3). Further sequence substitution mutations within the turn 1 and turn 5 regions consistently increase the rate of unfolding, while the effects upon the rate of folding appear variable, but overall, are less significant than the changes observed for the increased rate of unfolding (Table III).

Mitogenic Activity In addition to wild-type FGF-1, mitogenic activity towards NIH 3T3 fibroblasts was determined for the G19 and E60 deletion mutations (Fig. 4). The effective concentration for 50% maximal mitogenic stimulation (EC50) by wild-type FGF-1 was 60 ng/mL; the G19 mutant exhibited an EC50 of 1042 ng/mL ( 18-fold less mitogenic activity compared to wild-type) and the E60 mutant exhibited an EC50 of 943 ng/mL ( 16-fold less potent in comparison to the wild-type). DISCUSSION Analysis of the G19 mutant structure showed that turn 1 converted from a type I 4:6 to a type I 3:5 -hairpin turn. Furthermore, the i 3 Gly20 residue in the new turn structure remains located within the L- region of the Ramachandran plot, thus confirming the importance of retaining this residue. Although we hypothesized that deletion of a residue within the turn would result in formation of a type I 3:5 turn, it seemed likely that there would be an associated stability penalty, possibly severe, given the apparent uniqueness of the type I 4:6 turn at this location in the -trefoil architecture. Thus, it came as a surprise that the G19 mutant was essentially indistinguishable from the wild-type protein with regard to stability. As previously described in the Results section, the side chains in the new type I 3:5 turn are able to retain essentially equivalent interactions with neighboring groups in comparison to the wild-type structure. Shorter loop lengths are known to be associated with an increase in stability due to reduction in the entropic cost of forming such turns30 with a consequent increase in the rate of folding.31,32 Furthermore, the substitution of Gly to nonGly residues can also stabilize proteins due to the reduction in the entropic gain of unfolding,33 and a deletion of a Gly residue may therefore similarly stabilize the struc-

ture. Thus, the G19 mutation might be expected to exhibit a favorable entropic effect upon protein stability; however, the observed wild-type equivalent stability suggests that this is being offset by an essentially equivalent enthalpic penalty (i.e., the noncovalent interactions within the turn, and between the turn and surrounding environment, are less optimal than in the wild-type structure). The folding and unfolding kinetic data shows that the G19 mutant achieves its equivalent stability by concomitant increases in both the folding and unfolding rates (Fig. 3), indicating that this mutation has stabilized the folding transition intermediate. The rate-limiting event in -hairpin folding in peptide systems has been shown to correspond to formation of the turn (as opposed to formation of the -sheet secondary structure).31 Thus, the stabilization of the folding transition state observed for the G19 mutant indicates that formation of the wild-type turn 1 structure contributes to the rate limiting step of FGF-1 folding. The observed stabilization of the folding transition intermediate, combined with the inferred enthalpic penalty for the native structure, suggests that the mutant type I 3:5 turn may self-nucleate more efficiently than the wild-type type I 4:6 turn, but that it is ultimately accommodated less favorably within the native structure. This suggests that there is a need to optimize the enthalpic interactions of the mutant turn with the local environment. The results indicate that the type I 4:6 turn at turn 1 of FGF-1 can be replaced with a type I 3:5 turn with no significant deleterious effects upon protein stability; however, the NIH 3T3 cell proliferation assay showed an 18-fold reduction in mitogenic activity for the G19 mutant (Fig. 4). Analysis of the available FGF-1/FGFR-2/ heparin complex structures shows that turn 1 in FGF-1 interacts with domain D2 of FGFR-2.34 In particular, the main-chain carbonyl of Ser17 hydrogen bonds with the side-chain N atom of K163 in the receptor. Furthermore, there are extensive van der Waals contacts between K163 of the receptor and the turn 1 region, and these are disrupted upon conversion to the type I 3:5 turn. Thus, although the type I 3:5 turn conformation is compatible with stability and folding of FGF-1, it is deleterious for receptor binding functionality. This suggests that the turn 1 type I 4:6 turn was selected for on the basis of functional considerations. The X-ray structure data for the E60 mutant shows that the type I 4:6 turn has converted into a type I 3:5 turn (Fig. 2), with Gly62 at the i 3 position and located within the L- region of the Ramachandran plot. The stability and folding data shows that, unlike G19, a deletion mutation in turn 5 is destabilizing, regardless of position. The best-tolerated deletion mutant within turn 5 is E60, albeit accommodated with a modest 3.9 kJ/mol decrease in stability (Table II). There is essentially no effect upon the rate of folding, but rather an increase in the rate of unfolding (Table III). This suggests that the mutation resulted primarily in destabilization of the native state. The structure of this mutant demonstrates that, unlike the G19 mutant, the hydrogen bonding interactions within

(Lower panel) Relaxed stereo diagram of an overlay of the turn 1 (CPK color scheme) and turn 5 (gray) regions in the S17T/N18T/ G19 and E60 mutants, respectively.

the turn are substantially altered from the wild-type structure (Fig. 2). Following from the study of Serrano and coworkers,35 the destabilization is assigned to an increase in strain within the turn, with minimal effects upon overall enthalpy.35 Thus, we conclude that although the alternative hydrogen-bonding arrangement observed in the E60 mutant may be similar in overall enthalpy to the wild-type turn, it is accomplished with greater structural strain. The mitogenic activity of the E60 mutant is 16-fold lower than wild-type. Although the E60 mutation is less stable than the G19 mutant, it exhibits slightly greater mitogenic activity. Because turn 5 is not involved in interactions with FGF receptor, we conclude that the reduction in potency of E60 is likely associated with the reduction in stability (and might therefore be recovered by additional mutagenesis designed to increase stability). We attempted to optimize the turn sequence of E60 by replacing the Thr residue at the i 2 position with Asp, because Asp has been reported as the most favorable residue at i 2 position in type I turns.36 However, this mutation showed no improvement in stability (Table II), suggesting that specific interactions with the local environment are the more critical determinant of turn stability in this case. -Hairpin turns 1 and 5 of FGF-1 are related by the threefold tertiary structure symmetry intrinsic to the

-trefoil architecture (Fig. 1). In the wild-type structure these type I 4:6 turns overlay with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.46 Å (for main chain atoms; Fig. 5) despite their amino acid sequence differences. The G19 and E60 deletion mutations convert turns 1 and 5, respectively, to type I 3:5 turns. Again, despite the differences in amino acid sequence, these novel turn structures are essentially identical (Fig. 5), and the main chain atoms of the two turns overlay with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.31 Å. Thus, we hypothesize that the turn structure is dictated by the combined effects of the number of residues within the turn and the fundamental molecular architecture ( trefoil) that defines the general steric environment of the turn; while the overall stability of the turn is determined by the interactions between the specific residues within the turn (i.e., the amino acid sequence of the turn) and groups comprising the local environment. To test this hypothesis we constructed a series of sequence-swapping mutations between turns 1 and 5 (within the G19 and E60 background forms) (Tables II and III). Such sequenceswapping contributed to additional instability for both turn types, indicating that even in the type I 3:5 turn form, both turn sequences were relatively optimized for their local environment. The X-ray structure of the S17T/N18T/ G19 mutant confirmed that sequence-swapping effects were independent of any structural alteration of the basic turn type (Fig. 2).

J. LEE ET AL.

We have previously reported a study of sequenceswapping mutations for turns 4 and 8 of FGF-1.11 Although related by the threefold tertiary structure symmetry these turns exhibit different turn types (type VIba for turn 4 and type I 3:5 for turn 8). Sequence-swapping did not alter the overall conformation of these turns, although it did affect overall stability. Thus, the present results are consistent in supporting the hypothesis that basic turn architecture in proteins is largely independent of turn sequence, but that turn sequence influences overall stability. The implication of these observations is that there must be a greater free energy contribution associated with the formation of the secondary and tertiary structures connected by such turns, in comparison to the free energy associated with alternative turn conformations (which might disrupt the connecting structure); this may be most pronounced in -hairpin turns, where a single amino acid misalignment in a -strand results in a drastic 180° reorientation of all side chains. In a related and interesting study by Searle and coworkers,37 a deletion mutation in -hairpin turn 1 of ubiquitin (from a type I 3:5 turn to a type I 2:2 turn) resulted in a nonnative register of the associated -strands in a peptide fragment of ubiquitin.37 When this deletion mutation was introduced into the intact protein, the nonnative turn structure frustrated the folding of the native state and destabilized the native structure by 10 kJ/mol. In the present case, the conversion of type I 4:6 to type I 3:5 turns via deletion mutations in FGF-1 is associated with minimal energetic differences between the two turn types. Thus, type I 4:6 and 3:5 turn types may be similar to each other in energetics, but substantially more stable than 2:2 type turns. Furthermore, in cases where -hairpin turn structures have been shown to interconvert due to sequence changes, the energetic differences between the turn types can be minimal (e.g., turn I to II conversion in Cro repressor38). Thus, different turn structures, even though they may differ in length, can have minimal energetic differences. Finally, an important implication of the present work for the de novo design of -trefoil proteins is that a simple type I 3:5 turn might be utilized at every location requiring a -turn. If designed correctly, in particular, if the turn sequences are chosen so as to favorably interact with atoms comprising the local environment, such a designed protein can be expected to be stable and foldable. The results of the present report thus help to conceptually simplify one important aspect of the architectural design of this fundamental superfold. Of course, if the design principle requires efficient binding to the FGF receptor, then consideration must be made for including a type I 4:6 turn at the turn 1 location, but this is certainly not essential for basic stability or foldability.
