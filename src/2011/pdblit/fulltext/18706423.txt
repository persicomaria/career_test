Abstract The Mohr^Tranebjaerg syndrome (MTS), a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, mental retardation and blindness, is a mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in the deafness/ dystonia peptide 1 (DDP1) gene. DDP1 shows similarity to the yeast proteins Tim9, Tim10 and Tim12, components of the mitochondrial import machinery for carrier proteins. Here, we show that DDP1 belongs to a large family of evolutionarily conserved proteins. We report the identification, chromosomal localization and expressional analysis of six human family members which represent further candidate genes for neurodegenerative diseases. z 1999 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Key words: Mitochondrial inner membrane translocase TIM22; Deafness/dystonia peptide 1/Tim10 protein family; Mohr^Tranebjaerg syndrome 1. Introduction The recent description of a novel pathomechanism leading to a mitochondrial disease is based on the homology of the a¡ected protein DDP1 to a family of conserved yeast components involved in mitochondrial preprotein import [3]. The gene encoding deafness/dystonia peptide 1 (DDP1) is mutated in the Mohr^Tranebjaerg syndrome (MTS), a rare X-linked neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, mental retardation and blindness [1]. Until recently, the cellular localization and function of the 11 kDa deafness/dystonia peptide was unknown [1]. The putative function of DDP1 was recently discovered based on its similarity to Tim9, Tim10 and Tim12, components of the TIM22 machinery for import of nuclear encoded mitochondrial inner membrane proteins [2^5]. Import of nuclear encoded precursor proteins into the mitochondria is mediated by a general translocase in the outer membrane, the TOM complex, which cooperates with two distinct translocases in the mitochondrial inner membrane, the TIM23 and the TIM22 complex [6,7]. The TIM23 complex mediates the import of preproteins with a positively charged matrix targeting signal while the TIM22 complex me-

diates the import of integral inner membrane proteins which do not carry a matrix targeting signal. These are members of the mitochondrial carrier family such as the ADP/ATP carrier, the inorganic phosphate carrier but also other hydrophobic membrane proteins with internal targeting signals. For import of carrier proteins, the TIM22 complex interacts with three small proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space, Tim9, Tim10 and Tim12 which are organized in two distinct hetero-oligomeric 70 kDa complexes [2,8]. Tim9, Tim10 and Tim12 are structurally related zinc ¢nger proteins [4] that contain a conserved Cys4 zinc ¢nger motif. The TIM9W10 complex appears to contain three molecules of Tim9 and three molecules of Tim10 [2,9] and the TIM9W10W12 complex might be composed of three molecules of Tim9, two molecules of Tim10 and one molecule of Tim12 [2,9]. The TIM9W10W12 complex is ¢rmly associated with the membrane-integrated components of the TIM22 complex whereas the TIM9W10 complex is not associated with mitochondrial membranes [2,9]. The TIM22 complex cooperates with both the TIM9W10 and the TIM9W10W12 complex which sequentially interact with hydrophobic precursors and maintain them in an insertion-competent conformation [10^13]. The insertion of the hydrophobic preproteins into the inner membrane is mediated by Tim22 in a reaction that requires the inner membrane potential, v8 [14]. Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two further proteins, Tim8 and Tim13, which are structurally related to Tim9, Tim10 and Tim12 [3]. These proteins also contain a Cys4 motif and are therefore likely also zinc ¢nger proteins. The precise function of Tim8 and Tim13 is not known. Both proteins are localized in the intermembrane space and they are organized in hetero-oligomeric 70 kDa complexes [3]. However, import of carrier proteins is not a¡ected in cells harboring disrupted alleles of TIM8 and TIM13. Thus, they are not essential for import of these precursors. Yet, a fraction of Tim8 and Tim13 appears to be in a complex with Tim9 and Tim10 as vtim8 yeast strains display synthetic lethality with a temperature sensitive mutant allele of TIM10, suggesting a functional interaction of these components [3]. DDP1, the human Tim8 homologue, and DDP2, a second predicted protein highly similar to DDP1 [1], are human members of this novel family of small zinc ¢nger proteins. Here, we show that the small Tim proteins belong to an evolutionarily conserved protein family. In particular, we report the identi¢cation, chromosomal localization and expressional analysis of the human homologues of components of the yeast

M.F. Bauer et al./FEBS Letters 464 (1999) 41^47 sequences was additionally ampli¢ed from all family members. The PCR fragments were puri¢ed (Qiagen0 ) and subjected to direct sequencing using the BIG-DYE termination kit (ABI-Perkin-Elmer0 ). 2.5.

TIM22 translocase which represent further candidate genes for human neurodegenerative diseases. 2. Material and methods
2.1. cDNA isolation Human EST databases were searched for DDP/Tim10-related sequences using the TBLASTN option of the BLAST division of NCBI. EST contigs corresponding to the human cDNAs for Tim8, Tim9, Tim10 and Tim13 were identi¢ed. The assembled EST contigs are mainly represented by the following `tentative human contigs' (THCs) accessible via TIGR (http://www.tigr.org/): THC221395 (hTim9), THC256243 (hTim10a), THC214970 (hTim10b), THC219996 (hTim13), THC260031 (DDP1), THC258076 (DDP2) and THC258075 (`hDDP2-like'). EST clones falling into the same cluster are represented by the UNIGENE IDs Hs.108527 (hTim9), Hs.109571 (hTim10a), Hs.54943 (hTim10b), Hs.76086 (hTim13), Hs.7499 (DDP2 and `DDP2-like') and Hs.125565 (DDP1). The hTim22 cDNA is based on EST sequences represented by UNIGENE ID Hs.87595. Downloaded ESTs were assembled using the DNAstar software for PC and edited manually. The coding sequences of the deduced cDNAs were additionally con¢rmed by direct sequencing of selected EST clones using vector-speci¢c primers. 2.2. Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping Mapping data were available for TIM10a, TIM13, TIM9, DDP2 and TIM22 through the EST mapping consortium. The TIM13 gene has previously been mapped as part of the human LMNB2 gene locus (accession no. M94363). RH mapping was performed to locate TIM10b and, additionally, to con¢rm map locations of TIM10a and TIM9. The GeneBridge4 RH panel (HGMP Ressource Center, Cambridge) was screened by PCR using combinations of intron-speci¢c and exon-speci¢c primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2.3. Northern blot analyses Adult human tissues Northern blots, containing 2 Wg per lane of poly(A) RNA, were purchased from Clontech0 and hybridized using standard protocols. Hybridization probes speci¢c for coding regions of DDP1, DDP2, hTim9, hTim10a, hTim10b and hTim13 were generated by PCR on human ¢rst strand cDNA and 32 P-labeled using the ReadyPrime kit (Pharmazia0 ). The same blot was re-hybridized with a L-actin probe in order to normalize the intensity of the speci¢c hybridization signal to that of L-actin. 2.4. Sequencing of TIM13 in the DFNB15 family Using genomic DNA from a¡ected and una¡ected members of the DFNB15 family as template, exons 1, 2 and 3 of the TIM13 gene (ppv1 gene) were ampli¢ed as two non-overlapping fragments using gene-speci¢c primers according to the published ppv1 sequence. To exclude major deletions, a 1.6 kb fragment encompassing the entire TIM13 gene including major 5P- and 3P-untranslated region (UTR)

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Identi¢cation of the human homologue of Tim22 TBLASTN searches in human EST databases identi¢ed over 50 ESTs with similarity to yeast Tim22, a central component of the membrane-integrated portion of the TIM22 translocase. The assembled cDNA contig of 1669 bp encodes a predicted protein of 194 amino acid residues. The protein sequences of hTim22 and yTim22 exhibit an overall identity of 29% (similarity 41%) (Fig. 1). In yeast, Tim22 is in a complex with the integral inner membrane protein Tim54. No human homologue of Tim54 could be identi¢ed in the EST databases. Interestingly, no TIM54 gene could be identi¢ed in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans, while Tim54 homologues appear to be expressed in a number of di¡erent fungi (Prokisch, personal communication). 3.2. Identi¢cation and characterization of human cDNAs encoding members of the DDP/Tim10 protein family In S. cerevisiae, Tim22 interacts functionally and physically with small, related zinc ¢nger proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Homology searches identi¢ed novel human open reading frames (ORFs) encoding putative zinc ¢nger proteins characterized by a Cys4 motif. Based on their sequence similarity to the small Tim proteins of yeast, they were classi¢ed as members of the DDP/Tim10 protein family (Fig. 2). Three human cDNA contigs encoding putative homologues of yeast Tim9, 10 and 12 were found. Based on phylogenetic analysis, two sequences, hTim10a and hTim10b, may represent orthologues of yeast Tim10 and Tim12, while the third sequence may encode an orthologue of yeast Tim9 (Fig. 3). The cDNA sequences of hTim10a and hTim10b are 658 bp and 1468 bp in length and were derived from two distinct, non-overlapping EST contigs, THC256243 and THC214970. Both contigs contain a single ORF encoding predicted proteins of 90 and 103 amino acid residues.

The CX3 C-X14À17 -CX3 C zinc ¢nger domains and £anking regions (49^54 amino acid residues) of small Tim proteins from di¡erent species were aligned using MegAlign program, DNAstar for PC (Gap weigth = 3, gap length penalty = 10). Entire lengths of proteins (in amino acid residues) and GenBank accession numbers are indicated.

Schizosaccharomyces.

hTim10b is highly similar to mouse and rat Tim10b (AF150103 and AF150106). A previously published cDNA sequence encoding Rattus norvegicus FxC1 (fracture callus 1) [15] is identical to the rat Tim10b cDNA but lacks the 5P-region. FxC1 therefore represents an N-terminally incomplete Tim10b protein sequence.

The human cDNA (THC221395) with similarity to yeast Tim9 is 1027 bp in length and contains a single ORF encoding a predicted protein of 89 amino acid residues. A previously described gene (ppv1) located within the 3P-UTR of the human lamin B gene (LMNB2) encodes the putative human homologue of yeast Tim13 [16]. The predicted

Fig. 4. Northern blot analyses on multiple-tissue mRNA blots were performed using radiolabeled cDNA probes. Transcript sizes of 1.2 kb (DDP1), 0.8 kb (DDP2), 1.2 kb (hTim9), 1.0 kb (hTim10a), 1.35 kb (hTim10b) and 1.3 kb/1.0 kb (hTim13) were detected. Blots were exposed for 1^2 days, the hTim10a-speci¢c blot was exposed for 6 days.

ppv1 protein of 95 amino acid residues is classi¢ed as member of the DDP/Tim10 protein family based on its characteristic Cys4 motif and was, therefore, renamed hTim13 (Fig. 2). A second THC contig (THC196963) covered by only two ESTs (AA071111 and AA084879) gives rise to a protein which differs in ¢ve amino acid residues from hTim13 (not shown). These two ESTs are derived from a neuroepithelial library which has been assigned to be contaminated with mouse-derived clones. Since the two EST sequences are identical with the cDNA sequence of mouse Tim13, it is unlikely that AA071111 and AA084879 encode a second human Tim13 homologue. A number of human ESTs correspond apparently to the previously described genes DDP1 and DDP2 [1,3] which encode small proteins of 97 and 83 amino acid residues, respectively, which both contain the characteristic Cys4 motif (Fig. 2). Analysis of DDP2-speci¢c EST clones revealed that the amino acid sequence predicted from the assembled EST contig (THC258076) di¡ers in the N-terminal portion from the published protein sequence [3]. We con¢rmed this by sequencing of three independent EST clones.

A second `DDP2-like' EST contig could be assembled (THC258075) di¡ering from the authentic DDP2 cDNA by an insertion of 333 bp between codon 28 and codon 29 and by a number of nucleotide exchanges upstream of this insertion. The 333 bp insertion is located exactly at the exon/intron splice site (CAG-GTG) of the DDP2 gene but shows no similarity to the genomic intron sequence of the authentic DDP2 (data not shown). The `DDP2-like' ESTs may therefore originate from a duplicated gene. The 333 bp insertion contains no ORFs. Translation initiation from an ATG corresponding to codon 33 of authentic DDP2 could give rise to an N-terminally truncated polypeptide containing the Cys4 motif. As the 333 bp insert contains out of frame ATG codons, it is unclear whether the `DDP2-like' cDNA is translated. A pseudogene of DDP2 was identi¢ed in a genomic DNA library. The pseudogene shows 97% identity with the DDP2 ORF. The genomic sequence lacks the DDP2 translation initiation codon, does not contain introns but contains a poly(A) tail. This suggests that the pseudogene resulted from re-integration of a processed DDP2 mRNA into the genome.

3.3. The small Tim proteins belongs to an evolutionary conserved family TBLASTN searches in available EST and genomic databases resulted in the identi¢cation of 44 new ORFs throughout the kingdom of eukaryotes with similarity to the small Tim proteins of yeast (Fig. 2). Thus, homologues of the small Tim proteins appear to be expressed in all eukaryotic organisms. All ORFs encode putative zinc ¢nger proteins of about 10 kDa containing a Cys4 motif with the consensus CX3 C-X14À17 -CX3 C (Fig. 2). A phylogenetic analysis based on the alignment of the proteins assigned the sequences to two major groups, each of which divide into two subgroups (Fig. 3). The signi¢cance of the groups and subgroups was assessed by bootstrap analyses. One group is represented by the essential yeast components Tim9, Tim10 and Tim12 while the other group contains the non-essential yeast components Tim8 and Tim13. Yeast Tim10 and Tim12 are closely related and fall in one subgroup, while Tim9, Tim8 and Tim13 fall into independent subgroups (Fig. 3). The four subgroups of the protein family di¡er in their sequence composition and in the length of the zinc ¢nger between the two conserved cysteine pairs (Fig. 2). Apparently, all organisms encode at least one member of each subgroup. Six putative members of this protein family seem to be expressed in mammals. The Tim8/13 group contains three mammalian homologues, two belong to the Tim8 subgroup and one falls into the Tim13 subgroup. The Tim9/10 group also contains three mammalian members. Although the assignment to the subgroups is not unambiguous, one member appears to belong to the Tim9 subgroup and two to the Tim10 subgroup (Fig. 3). 3.4. Mapping of human TIM genes The rapid and ongoing e¡orts of the international EST mapping consortium result in a rising number of mapped human ESTs. Corresponding to EST data, TIM10a maps between D11S1361 and D11S913 (11p11.1^q12), DDP2 between D11S1347 and D11S939 (11q22.1^q22.2), TIM9 between D14S290 and D14S274 (14q21) and TIM13 between pTEL and D19S413 (19p13.3) (Table 1). The latter position is in accordance with the map location reported for the LMNB2 gene [16]. The human TIM22 gene maps to chromosome 17p13. None of the ESTs corresponding to TIM10b contained sequence-tagged sites. Using RH mapping, we localized TIM10b to chromosome 11q15.3^q15.5. We additionally con¢rmed the chromosomal locations of TIM10a and TIM9 gene by RH mapping. The DDP2 pseudogene was found to be contained on BAC clone bWXD177 (AC002407) which has been sequenced during the X-chromosome sequencing project (Center for Genetics in Medicine, Washington University, http://www.ibc.wustl.edu/) and maps to chromosome Xq27.2. 3.5. Expression analysis of human genes encoding small Tim proteins Human genes encoding members of the DDP/Tim10 protein family were analyzed for their expression patterns in adult human tissues. All members of the human DDP/Tim10 family appear to be ubiquitously expressed with highest steady-state levels in heart, liver, skeletal muscle and kidney (Fig. 4). The transcript sizes were determined as 1.2 kb for DDP1, 0.8 kb for DDP2, 1.2 kb for hTim9, 1.0 kb for hTim10a, 1.35 kb for hTim10b and 1.3 kb for hTim13. A second hTim13 transcript

of 1.0 kb was detected in pancreas. hTim10a is expressed at signi¢cantly lower levels than hTim9 and hTim10b, speci¢c signals being detected only after long exposition of Northern blots. In yeast, Tim12 is more than one order of magnitude less abundant than Tim9 and Tim10. yTim12 mediates association of the TIM9W10W12 complex with Tim22 in the inner membrane while the TIM9W10 complex is not membrane-associated [2]. Whether hTim10a exerts a similar function as yTim12 remains to be established. 3.6. Small Tim proteins and neurodegeneration Mutation of DDP1/hTim8a was shown to be causative for the MTS [1,3]. Since the DDP/Tim10 family is highly conserved, the other members of the DDP/Tim10 family are also candidate genes for neurodegenerative disorders associated with deafness, dystonia, optic atrophy or mental deterioration. As yTim13 forms a complex with yTim8, hTim13 could interact with DDP1/hTim8a in human mitochondria. Thus, hTim13 appears to be a likely candidate gene for a MTS-like disorder. We noticed that the chromosomal localization of TIM13 (19p13.3) corresponds to a disease locus associated with an autosomal recessive and non-syndromic form of deafness in an Indian family (DFNB15) [17]. However, sequencing of the TIM13 gene in a¡ected as well as in una¡ected members of the DFNB15 family revealed no pathogenic mutations (data not shown). This excludes TIM13 as the underlying disease gene for the DFNB15-associated inherited hearing loss. Chen and co-workers identi¢ed a second DFNB15 locus on 3q21.3^q25.2. No member of the human DDP/Tim10 gene family maps to chromosome 3. Therefore, it is unlikely that this form of hearing loss is caused by a defect in members of the DDP/Tim10 family. Clinical phenotypes associated with mutations of DDP1 have been shown to range from apparent non-syndromic forms of deafness to complex neurodegenerative syndromes including deafness, dystonia, mental de¢ciency and blindness [1]. In the original Norwegian family with MTS described ¢rst in 1960 [18], a non-syndromic recessive and progressive form of deafness was reported. The re-investigation of this family 35 years later revealed the deafness as part of a more complex syndrome that includes cortical blindness, dystonia and mental de¢ciency. Moreover, mutations in DDP1 might also be responsible for related clinical phenotypes such as Jensen syndrome which is characterized by optico-acoustic nerve atrophy with dementia [19]. The underlying pathomechanism common to these diseases might be degeneration of the central nervous system, in particular basal ganglia and corticospinal tract due to a de¢ciency of a subclass of inner membrane proteins. Clinical features of MTS resemble typical defects of mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation [20]. Yet, the underlying mechanism cannot be deduced from yeast strains harboring single and double deletions of TIM8 and TIM13. Those retain respiratory competence and show no e¡ect on the biogenesis of the ADP/ATP carrier and of the phosphate carrier [3]. As yeast encodes 35 di¡erent carrier proteins [21], it is possible that Tim8 promotes the import of carrier proteins whose inactivation has no phenotype in yeast [5]. MTS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder which affects post-mitotic tissues. Since the TIM8 is not an essential gene in yeast, mutations in DDP1/TIM8a in humans could

Knowledge about the human homologues and their function in import pathways will give important insights into the pathomechanisms of MTS and will facilitate the identi¢cation of further disease genes responsible for mitochondrial disorders.
