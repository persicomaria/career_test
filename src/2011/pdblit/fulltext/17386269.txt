Unraveling the structure and assembly of the DNA packaging ATPases of the tailed double-stranded DNA bacteriophages is integral to understanding the mechanism of DNA translocation. Here, the bacteriophage 29 packaging ATPase gene product 16 (gp16) was overexpressed in soluble form in Bacillus subtilis (pSAC), purified to near homogeneity, and assembled to the 29 precursor capsid (prohead) to produce a packaging motor intermediate that was fully active in in vitro DNA packaging. The formation of higher oligomers of the gp16 from monomers was concentration dependent and was characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, and electron microscopy. The binding of multiple copies of gp16 to the prohead was dependent on the presence of an oligomer of 174- or 120-base prohead RNA (pRNA) fixed to the head­tail connector at the unique portal vertex of the prohead. The use of mutant pRNAs demonstrated that gp16 bound specifically to the A-helix of pRNA, and ribonuclease footprinting of gp16 on pRNA showed that gp16 protected the CC residues of the CCA bulge (residues 18­20) of the A-helix. The binding of gp16 to the prohead/pRNA to constitute the complete and active packaging motor was confirmed by cryoelectron microscopy three-dimensional reconstruction of the prohead/ pRNA/gp16 complex. The complex was capable of supercoiling DNA­gp3 as observed previously for gp16 alone; therefore, the binding of gp16 to the prohead, rather than first to DNA­gp3, represents an alternative packaging motor assembly pathway.

Introduction
The packaging of the genomes of the tailed doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages into preformed protein capsids (proheads) is a remarkable process in which the highly charged DNA is compacted to near crystalline density. 1,2 Molecular motors assembled at the unique portal vertex of the prohead drive packaging, converting energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis to power DNA translocation. The motor in bacteriophage 29 is among the most powerful biological motors known, generating forces in the range of 60­100 pN.3,4 The packaging

1115 location, have been identified.33­36 Bases 22­84 of the pRNA were identified to be the prohead binding domain by ribonuclease footprinting, and this was confirmed by mutant studies and competitive binding experiments.26,33,34 While the prohead binding domain is well characterized, knowledge of the gp16 binding domain has been rudimentary. A mechanistic understanding of the DNA packaging process in 29 and other dsDNA phages is lacking in spite of extensive biochemical, structural, biophysical, and theoretical studies.2,14 A model for how 29 DNA is translocated into the capsid was proposed in which ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release of products induce conformational changes in the ATPases that are directly involved in the translocation of the DNA.37 DNA translocation is triggered or performed by the ring of ATPases, possibly in concert with other motor components, such as the head­tail connector, via a conformational change that likely follows release of phosphate after ATP hydrolysis.37 Many of the packaging mechanism models have been based on rotation of the head­tail connector.2,38 However, recent evidence suggested that the T4 connector does not rotate during DNA translocation,39 and a direct test by following the orientation of single fluorophores attached to the connector provided evidence that the 29 connector does not rotate.40 In phage SPP1, amino acid loops in the connector channel that tightly embrace DNA are proposed to form an undulating `wave' of conformational change as DNA is translocated, which may coordinate ATP hydrolysis whether force is applied by the ATPase itself or by ATPase-induced conformational change in the connector.41 On the basis of a crystal structure of the ATPase gp17 of phage T4 at 1.8 Å and the similarity of this structure to monomeric helicases, it was proposed that DNA is translocated by the gp17 itself, with each monomer in the ring of ATPases sequentially detecting the same DNA structural component after translocation of DNA by two base pairs.9 Here, overexpression of gp16 in its natural B. subtilis host is described. The protein has been purified to greater than 99% homogeneity to obtain soluble and highly active protein in milligram quantities needed for structural and functional studies. The physical state of the protein in solution as well as its pRNA and DNA binding properties are described. An alternative pathway of gp16 assembly to the prohead prior to interaction with DNA­gp3 is documented. Multiple copies of gp16 interact with the prohead-bound pRNA oligomer to constitute the DNA packaging motor, and the isolated prohead/ pRNA/gp16 complex is active in DNA packaging without the aid of additional gp16. The pRNA­gp16 interaction is ATP independent, and the gp16 binding is shown to be A-helix specific by use of pRNA mutants and RNase footprinting. Cryo-EM reconstruction demonstrates that the pRNA­gp16 oligomers are both 5-fold symmetric and interfaced such that the motor subunits may be gp16­pRNA heterodimers.

machines include a ring of ATPases (terminases), the head­tail connector of the prohead, the prohead, and the DNA substrate. These components show many biochemical and structural similarities, suggesting a common mechanism for DNA translocation.5­7 Terminases belong to a large family of ATPases involved in DNA transactions, such as cell division, chromosome segregation, recombination, strand separation, and conjugation.8,9 Each terminase has large and small subunits: The large subunit has prohead and ATP binding activities, potential magnesium binding motifs, and endonuclease activity.9­14 The terminase small subunit has DNA binding and packaging stimulation activities. Unraveling the structure, assembly, and function of packaging ATPases is essential in gaining an understanding of the packaging mechanism. In the DNA packaging system of the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage 29, gene product 16 (gp16) corresponds to the large terminase subunit, whereas gp3 terminally bound to the 5 DNA ends (DNA­gp3) represents the small subunit.15 In vitro and in vivo encapsidation of 29 DNA­gp3 into proheads both require gp16,16,17 a ~39,000 molecular weight protein with the Walker A and Walker B motifs needed for ATP hydrolysis. Although 29 is one of the best characterized systems for study of the dsDNA packaging mechanism and the structure of the head­tail connector is determined,18,19 limited structural information is available for gp16 and its assembly to constitute the packaging motor. Detailed physical and biological characterization of gp16 has been challenged by its insolubility after overexpression and purification. Expression of gp16 in Escherichia coli yielded inclusion bodies, and because the bulk of the protein was insoluble after renaturation, about 100 copies of protein were needed to package each 29 DNA in the completely defined in vitro system.20 The following are unique features of 29 DNA­gp3 packaging: (i) the DNA­gp3 packaging substrate is supercoiled by the concerted action of gp16 and gp3 in the absence of the prohead, and the preferential packaging of this DNA/gp3/gp16 complex suggests that gp16 constitutes the packaging motor while bound to DNA21; (ii) a 174-base 29-encoded RNA (or its 120-base derivative) (prohead RNA, pRNA) is an essential packaging motor component22; (iii) pRNA binds to the connector of the prohead,23 and cryo-electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions show that gp16 binds to the pRNA18; (iv) the ATPase activity of gp16 is pRNA dependent24 such that the ATPase "subunits" of the packaging motor may be gp16­pRNA heterodimers; and (v) in vitro packaging rivals in vivo packaging in efficiency,2,16,20 facilitating study of the packaging mechanism. pRNA binds to the prohead in a specific, rapid, irreversible, and magnesium-dependent reaction.25­31 Although pRNA and gp16 are essential to DNA packaging, their presence is transitory during phage assembly, as both components are displaced during neck/tail assembly and are absent in the mature phage.32 Two functional regions of pRNA, a prohead binding region and a region involved in DNA trans-

Results
Production of soluble gp16, purification, and biological activity Production of gp16 in E. coli (pPLc2833) yields inclusion bodies, and the bulk of the highly hydrophobic protein is insoluble after treatment of isolated inclusion bodies with guanidinium chloride, followed by urea,20 making detailed physical and biological characterization of this DNA packaging ATPase impossible. Gene 16 was expressed in B. subtilis to circumvent this, yielding soluble gp16 that has long been the source of ATPase for packaging assays.21 However, the details of plasmid construction and the purification of milligram amounts of protein to near homogeneity have not been published. Briefly, the EcoRI E/D segment of 29 DNA­ gp3 that includes gene 16,42 obtained by partial digestion, was cloned into the plasmid pUB18. The sucrose inducible promoter SACB43 was inserted to drive expression, and the resulting plasmid pSACBgp16 was transformed into B. subtilis WB30, an asporogenic, protease-defective strain. After induction of gene 16 expression with sucrose (Materials and Methods), about 70% of the gp16 was soluble. The ~39,000 molecular weight gp16 was purified to near homogeneity by cation exchange followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography (Fig. 1a). The pI of the purified protein was estimated at 10.2 by isoelectrofocusing, and its identity was confirmed by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-gp16 serum. The activity of purified gp16 in in vitro DNA­gp3 packaging was determined by a standard DNase protection assay (Fig. 1b).44 Purified gp16 was highly active, and multiple copies were required per prohead for DNA­gp3 packaging (Fig. 1b). No DNA­ gp3 packaging was detected in the absence of ATP or gp16 (Fig. 1b, lanes 2 and 10). A 4-fold reduction in gp16 resulted in a 40-fold reduction in packaging. These results are consistent with the in vitro DNA­ gp3 packaging in extracts, which shows a first-order concentration dependence for the prohead and DNA­gp3, while multiple copies of the packaging ATPase gp16 are required.45 Monomeric/multimeric state of gp16 No large aggregate of the purified gp16 at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml was detected by dynamic light scattering, and the hydrodynamic radius of 6­ 9 nm (data not shown) suggested that the protein was soluble and formed an oligomer. Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation was performed to determine the oligomeric state of gp16. The calculated monomer molecular weight of gp16 based on the amino acid sequence is 39,000. Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation confirmed that gp16 self-associates, giving a molecular weight greater than the monomer and an apparent molecular mass that varied with the protein concentration (Table 1). The apparent molecular mass of gp16 at various concentrations and speeds was

derived by fitting the data to a self-association model using NONLIN.46 Figure 2a shows the A280-versusr2/2 plots for gp16 at three protein concentrations at 11,000 rpm. Of the protein, 80%­85% was a trimer, and the rest was a monomer as determined by species analysis using the sedimentation analysis software SEDPHAT.48 A trimer of gp16 would have a molecular weight of 117,000, and this is the most abundant species at 0.2 mg/ml or at 11,000 rpm (Table 1). However, fits of the data consistent with only monomer to trimer models were unsatisfactory, indicating that additional species may be present. Furthermore, the data at higher protein concentrations and lower centrifugation speeds suggested that species larger than the trimer were present. SEDPHAT48 was used to determine the relative concentrations of additional species. Figure 2b shows a plot of A280 versus the radial position at 0.4 mg/ml and that at 8000 rpm. The data were fit with four possible species: monomer, trimer, hexamer, and dodecamer. The best fit of the data yielded 22%, 68%, and 10% of monomer, trimer, and dodecamer, respectively. The relatively small and random distribution of the residuals attests to the goodness of this fit. Indeed, other models tried,

1117 Monomers likely were not visualized because of their small size, and it is not known as to what extent increase in protein concentration during drying of the specimen contributed to formation of the multimers. Variation of the pH level, salt conditions, staining methods, or the presence of ATP did not alter the structure of gp16 by transmission EM. Characterization of the gp16­pRNA interaction Interaction between the ATPase gp16 and pRNA has been documented by the stimulation of the ATPase activity of gp16 by prohead-bound pRNA, which is needed continuously for ATP hydrolysis24; the presence of additional mass on the pRNA spokes of partially packaged particles in a cryo-EM threedimensional reconstruction, interpreted as gp1618; the binding of pRNA to gp16 on nitrocellulose filters49; the weak binding of pRNA to thioredoxin Histag gp16 fusion protein immobilized on a His-bind column50; and recent delineation of the molecular boundaries of the components of the packaging motor by cryo-EM reconstruction (Morais et al., unpublished). One hundred twenty-base pRNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of gp16, and the interaction was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in a native agarose gel (Fig. 3a) to characterize the gp16­pRNA interaction in solution. Mixed 1:1 (based on monomers), much of the pRNA disappears from its fast migration position (compare lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that the pRNA and gp16 interact to produce heterogeneous complexes that do not appear in the gel. Three copies of gp16 per pRNA (lane 3) were sufficient to shift the pRNA band in the gel, and as the copy number of gp16 per pRNA was increased, more of the pRNA/gp16 complex was retained in the wells of the gel. gp16 bound to 174base pRNA in the same manner (data not shown). The pRNA­gp16 interaction was independent of ATP. The complex was stable in the presence of 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and overnight incubation at 4 °C but was disrupted by 0.1% SDS. pRNA­gp16 (1:3) complexes were mixed and incubated with fiberless proheads (10:1), and following isolation by electrophoresis on a native agarose gel, the particles were tested for pRNA binding by staining with ethidium bromide and for gp16 binding following transfer to nitrocellulose and

such as monomer, dimer, and tetramer, yielded poor fits to the data. A dissociation constant for the oligomerization could not be obtained because gp16 was relatively difficult to maintain in a soluble state. At protein concentrations of 0.2­0.4 mg/ml, approximately 40% of the total protein was irreversibly lost even at a speed as low as 5000 rpm. This loss increased to 65% at 0.8 mg/ml, but additional loss was not seen at the higher centrifugation speeds of 8000 and 11,000 rpm. Nonreducing PAGE was done after the centrifugation to look for degradation and oxidized cysteine-driven oligomerization, and no protein degradation was detected. Secondary plots of the sedimentation equilibrium primary data (data not shown) indicated that gp16 was monomeric at protein concentrations below 100 g/ml. Gel filtration chromatography was performed at gp16 concentrations between 10 and 100 g/ml to confirm these findings. Buffer and temperature conditions were exactly the same as those used in the sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Figure 2c shows the elution profile of 100 g/ ml of gp16 on a Superdex 200 column (dashed line) with molecular weight markers (continuous line). gp16 eluted slightly ahead of a protein standard having a molecular weight of 44,000, consistent with gp16 being monomeric at concentrations less than 100 g/ml as suggested by the analytical ultracentrifugation results. Transmission EM of the purified gp16 at 50 g/ml was done to determine the size and shape of gp16. Figure 2, panels (d) and (e), shows purified gp16 negatively stained with uranyl acetate. gp16 appeared as rounded and porous oligomers with a diameter of 9.5 ± 1.5 nm, calculated from the area. Figure 2f shows a histogram of the multimer diameter measurements.

1119 defined in vitro system.22,51 pRNA-free proheads were reconstituted with 120-base pRNA/gp16 (1:3) complexes and the particles tested in the in vitro DNA­gp3 packaging system.44 The efficiency of packaging was dependent on the number of pRNA/ gp16 complexes (mixed as 1 pRNA:3 gp16) per prohead (Fig. 3b). Proheads were twofold in excess over DNA­gp3, and all of the DNA­gp3 was packaged when five to seven copies of pRNA and its associated gp16 were used per prohead in the in vitro DNA­gp3 packaging reaction. As pRNA is pentameric in cryo-EM reconstruction30 (Fig. 7d), the results suggested that nearly every pRNA molecule added was biologically active and that the gp16 molecules were also highly active. Isolation of a prohead/gp16 ATPase motor assembly intermediate Prior evidence for prohead/gp16 interaction was obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and ELISA tests,15,49 but the role of pRNA in the interaction was not clear. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used to determine the role of pRNA in the prohead/gp16 interaction. Figure 4 shows the predicted secondary structures of the various forms of pRNA tested for gp16 binding. Proheads with 174base pRNA52 (see following paragraph) were incubated with 20 copies of gp16 per prohead, and the complexes were sedimented in a sucrose density gradient (Fig. 5a). There was a clear shift in the position of proheads incubated with gp16, and the fastsedimenting particles were isolated and shown by SDS-PAGE to contain gp16 (Fig. 6a, lane 2). The copies of gp16 per prohead from densitometric analysis were about half those of the head­tail connector, which is known to contain 12 copies of gp10.18 This prohead/174-base pRNA/gp16 interaction is Mg2 + dependent and ATP independent. Proheads and gp16 interacted at high ionic strength (100 mM NaCl), but low ionic strength (10 mM) was needed to retain the bound gp16. The prohead/174-base pRNA/gp16 complexes isolated from the sucrose gradient were tested for in vitro DNA­gp3 packaging activity upon addition of DNA­gp3 and ATP (Fig. 6b). The isolated prohead/174-base pRNA/ATPase intermediate packaged DNA­gp3 without further addition of gp16 (lane 5), and with the same efficiency as proheads with 174-base pRNA mixed with gp16 in the in vitro reaction (lane 3), as the concentration of proheads used in the reaction of lane 3 was approximately twofold higher than that represented in lane 5. Figure 6b, lane 7, shows that packaging remained about the same upon addition of more gp16, and thus the isolated prohead/174-base pRNA/gp16 complex is a true intermediate with an intact and active packaging motor. The intermediate is stable and active in packaging after overnight storage at 4 °C. Also, just as EDTA treatment releases pRNA from the prohead,22 EDTA releases pRNA­gp16 as a complex from the prohead (data not shown). One hundred seventy-four-base pRNA (with domains I and II)52 is cleaved to a 120-base form (do-

development with anti-gp16 serum. Both pRNA and gp16 were found on the prohead, and excess pRNA/ gp16 migrated as a complex (data not shown). pRNA can be removed from the 29 prohead by treatment with EDTA or with RNase A, resulting in loss of DNA packaging activity, and reconstitution of these pRNA-free proheads with purified pRNA results in restoration of packaging activity in the

main I) by adventitious ribonucleases during prohead isolation, and both forms are active in reconstituting pRNA-free proheads for DNA­gp3 packaging.25 RNA-free proheads were reconstituted with 120-base pRNA (Fig. 4a), purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, incubated with gp16, and run again on a sucrose gradient to determine the role of the 54-base domain II in the prohead/gp16 interaction. gp16 co-sediments with proheads containing 120-base pRNA just as with proheads having 174base pRNA, and the isolated prohead/120-base pRNA/gp16 complex is functional in DNA­gp3 packaging (data not shown). Thus, domain II of pRNA was confirmed to be dispensable for in vitro packaging as shown previously.25 Figure 6c, lane 2, shows the composition of the prohead/120-base pRNA/gp16 complexes on a native agarose gel. A Western blot of the particle developed with anti-gp16 serum confirmed the presence of gp16 on these proheads (data not shown). pRNA dependency of the prohead/gp16 interaction and identification of the gp16 binding site on pRNA The prohead/gp16 interaction is pRNA dependent, as pRNA-free proheads incubated with gp16 did not show the characteristic faster sedimentation demonstrated for the prohead/pRNA/gp16 particles on a sucrose gradient (Fig. 5b), and gp16 was not

found on the isolated particles by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Thus, stable binding of gp16 to proheads required pRNA. Two functional domains of pRNA have been identified, a prohead binding domain and a segment involved in DNA translocation.33­35 The prohead binding domain consists of bases 22­84 and was identified by ribonuclease footprinting and competitive binding experiments, while the A-helix that contains bases 1­28 and 117­92 was predicted to interact with gp16 (Fig. 4a).18 Mutant pRNAs with truncations of the A-helix were employed to further define the gp16 binding site on the A-helix (Fig. 4b­d). The 71-base pRNA is an A-helix deletion mutant that retains the prohead binding activity of 120-base pRNA but cannot support in vitro DNA­gp3 packaging.34 pRNA-free proheads reconstituted with 71base pRNA and purified were incubated with gp16, and the mixture was sedimented in a sucrose density gradient (Fig. 5c). The sedimentation profiles of particles reconstituted with 71-base pRNA, without and with gp16 incubation, were similar, and no gp16 was detected on particles by SDS-PAGE. These results confirm that the prohead/gp16 interaction is mediated by pRNA and show directly that the A-helix is the site of gp16 binding. pRNA-free proheads were reconstituted with two pRNA deletion mutants and studied for gp16 binding by use of sucrose gradient centrifugation and SDS-PAGE of the isolated particles to further define

1121 RNase footprinting of gp16 on pRNA Ribonuclease footprinting analysis of 5 endlabeled [32P]120-base pRNA was performed with the RNases A, T1, and V1 to define the nucleotides of pRNA protected by gp16. Proheads reconstituted with [32P]120-base pRNA were separated from unbound labeled pRNA by centrifugation and used to produce footprints. In addition, free [32P]120-base pRNA was also complexed with gp16 for mapping of the gp16 interactive domain. Both free pRNA and prohead-bound pRNA complexed with gp16 were protected from RNase A digestion at residues 8 to 19, 5 to 3 (Fig. 7a and b). RNase T1 did not produce cleavage outside the prohead binding domain and was not useful for the current studies. Footprints produced with RNase V1 showed additional protection at residues 5 and 31 (data not shown). The present results confirmed the ribonuclease footprint of the prohead on pRNA, which demonstrated protection of residues 22­84 by the prohead with RNase V1 and enhanced cleavage of pRNA at residues 38­40 (data not shown).26 Cryo-EM three-dimensional reconstruction of the prohead/pRNA/gp16 packaging intermediate The electron-dense pRNA spokes that radiate from the head­tail connector in cryo-EM reconstructions were postulated to be A-helices.18 A cryo-EM reconstruction of pRNA-free proheads reconstituted with 71-base pRNA lacking the A-helix has confirmed this hypothesis (Morais et al., unpublished). Cryo-EM three-dimensional reconstruction of the prohead/ 174-base pRNA/gp16 motor assembly intermediate showed mass that bridged the pRNA spokes and was interpreted as gp16 (Fig. 7d­g). The localization of gp16 on the A-helix of pRNA was consistent with the sucrose density gradient sedimentation (Fig. 5) and ribonuclease footprinting (Fig. 7a and b) results. The presence of gp16 on the DNA-filled head was also demonstrated by incubating proheads/pRNA
Fig. 5. The sedimentation rate of proheads/pRNA increased in the presence of gp16 and was dependent on the presence of the pRNA A-helix.

Sedimentation is from left to right. gp16 was bound to proheads containing 174-base pRNA in the faster-sedimenting peak as revealed by SDSPAGE (Fig. 6a) and by in vitro DNA­gp3 packaging (Fig. 6b). (b) Sucrose density gradient profile of pRNA-free proheads (continuous line) and pRNA-free proheads incubated with gp16 (dashed line), showing that gp16 did not alter the sedimentation rate of the pRNA-free proheads; gp16 was not found on these proheads by SDS-PAGE. (c) Sucrose density gradient profile of proheads/71-base pRNA (continuous line) and proheads/71-base pRNA incubated with gp16 (dashed line), showing that gp16 did not alter the sedimentation rate of these proheads; gp16 was not found on the particles. The gradients in (a­c) were run at different times and under different conditions, and the peak positions are not comparable.

the sequences and elements of the pRNA A-helix needed for gp16 binding. Mutants lacking the CCA bulge at positions 18­20 of pRNA (R7 mutant, Fig. 4d) or the 14 residues at the 3 end of the A-helix (106base pRNA, Fig. 4b) have prohead binding competitor activity but no DNA­gp3 packaging activity.33 pRNA-free proheads reconstituted with these mutant pRNAs were able to bind gp16, indicating that the CCA bulge or the 14 bases at the 3 end of the A-helix were not required for the initial gp16­pRNA interaction, although particles so constituted were not active in DNA packaging (Table 2).

The filled heads were isolated on a sucrose density gradient and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8) and Western blotting (data not shown). gp16 remains on the filled head, apparently until displaced by subsequent neck/tail assembly.

Binding and supercoiling of DNA­gp3 by the prohead/pRNA/gp16 motor assembly intermediate gp16 binds and supercoils DNA­gp3 in vitro, and each coiled DNA retains about three copies of gp16 when isolated in a sucrose density gradient.21 This interaction of gp16 with DNA­gp3 is independent of the prohead, and the DNA­gp3/gp16 complex is packaged preferentially. The DNA­gp3 sedimentation assay was performed as described previously21 to reconcile these results with the present demonstration of the prohead/pRNA/gp16 intermediate and to gain insight on the order of assembly of gp16 in the initiation of DNA packaging in vitro. [3H]DNA­gp3 sedimented in the sucrose gradient as a peak centering on fraction 16 (Fig. 9a, black line).

The gradient sample was prepared by incubating proheads/pRNA for 10 min with a head-defective extract of cells from a restrictive infection with the 29 mutant sus7(614)­sus8(769)­sus14(1241), which served as a source of DNA­gp3 and excess gp16. Lane 1, filled heads consisting of capsid (gp8), connector (gp10), gp16, and head fibers (gp8.5); lane 2, gp16 marker; lane 3, prohead marker.

(Fig. 9a, pink line). A Western dot blot of the sucrose gradient fractions, developed with anti-gp16 serum, confirmed the co-sedimentation of gp16 with DNA­ gp3 (Fig. 9c) [Fig. 9b shows the position of gp16 alone in the gradient]. Addition of proheads/pRNA did not alter the sedimentation state of DNA­gp3 (Fig. 9d, green line). The prohead/pRNA/gp16 intermediate (Fig. 9d, yellow line) produced a faster-sedimenting DNA­gp3, just as gp16 did (Fig. 9d, pink line). The presence of proheads and that of gp16 on the fast-sedimenting DNA­gp3 were confirmed by Western blotting with anti-gp10 and with anti-gp16 sera, respectively. These results suggested that gp16, assembled as a component of the DNA packaging motor onto proheads/pRNA, was able to bind and supercoil the DNA­gp3 to produce an initiation complex for DNA packaging. While this interaction and formation of the higher-order complex are gp3 dependent, EMSA showed that gp16 binds nonspecifically to all HpaI fragments of proteinase Ktreated DNA­gp3 (Fig. 9e).

Discussion
The ATPase gp16 is a central component in packaging of the 29 genome, interacting with pRNA and DNA­gp3 to constitute the packaging motor at the capsid portal vertex and then providing the energy for DNA translocation. The ATPase (termi-

nase) large subunits of the dsDNA phages and herpesvirus tend to be insoluble,1,53 and production of the highly hydrophobic gp16 in soluble form for study of structure and function has been problematic. Inclusion bodies of gp16 produced in E. coli (pPLc2833) could only be partially solubilized by the use of guanidinium chloride followed by urea, and therefore about 100 molecules were used to package each DNA­gp3 in vitro.20 Co-expression of gp16 with GROESL in E. coli with the intent of producing soluble protein resulted in an excess of GROESL, which had to be removed.49 The production of gp16 with an N-terminal thioredoxin and His tag in E. coli resulted in an insoluble and inactive protein.54 Treatment with acetone or polyethylene glycol was needed to improve the solubility of the gp16­His­ thioredoxin. However, cleaving away thioredoxin cleaved gp16, making structural or functional studies of the native protein impossible. The present preparation of gp16 in a highly purified and soluble form in B. subtilis (pSAC) will facilitate studies of gp16 structure and function. The number of copies of the large terminase ATPase subunit required for optimal packaging activity is not fully understood, although biochemical data suggest that six copies are needed in T311 and gp17 is predicted to form a ring surrounding the DNA on the procapsid in T4.55 All the known terminase large subunits with ATPase activity exist predominantly as monomers in solution.56­60 Selfassociation of terminase monomers into oligomers has been reported by sedimentation velocity in  and by chemical cross-linking in T4 phage.13,14 gp16 exists in solution predominantly in a monomeric state at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, with trimers and higher-order structures at concentrations of 0.2­ 0.8 mg/ml as seen by gel filtration, sedimentation equilibrium studies, and EM (Fig. 2). Early in vitro packaging studies demonstrated higher-order concentration dependence for gp16, showing that multiple copies of gp16 were needed, while concentration dependence for proheads and DNA­gp3 was first order.16 The present study of gp16 produced in B. subtilis (pSAC) shows that the quantity of gp16 that was found on the isolated, fully active prohead/ pRNA/gp16 complex by SDS-PAGE was about half that of the dodecameric connector (Fig. 6a). Similarly, terminase large subunits of phages T3, T7, and P22 bind the procapsid.61­63 In phage , packaging is initiated by docking of the DNA/terminase (complex I)

at the portal vertex, and amino acids of the large subunit C-terminus are responsible for the capsid binding.64,65 Amino acid sequence analysis indicates that the Ntermini of many terminase large subunits have a conserved ATPase center.8 All known and predicted members of DNA packaging ATPase large subunits belong to the P-loop NTPase fold, which has conserved nucleotide binding (Walker A) and Mg2 + binding (Walker B) motifs.8,15 The ATPase domains of T4 gp17 and 29 gp16 appear to be similar. For example, the Walker B mutant D118E/E119D in gp16 of 29 is inactive in DNA packaging (data not shown), as is the mutant D255E/E256D in T4 gp17, which binds ATP but is unable to precisely orient the ATP

molecule.9 Also, the crystal structures of P4 of 12 and gp17 of T4 show a common ATPase domain.9,66 However, comparative genomic studies indicate that gp16 of 29 may be a diverging independent lineage from the HerA/FtsK ATPases.67,68 Sequence alignment and mutation data suggest that the adenine binding motif55 is not conserved among the gp16 analogs and is different from that of T4 gp17 (data not shown). Massey et al.69 showed that FtsK ATPase exists as a monomer in solution, and formation of hexameric rings around DNA was dependent only on the presence of DNA and was independent of nucleotide or magnesium ions. The FtsK ATPase, like gp16, differs from terminases in lacking domain fusions with their nuclease partners.

1126 The 29 DNA packaging motor differs primarily from its counterparts among the dsDNA phages by having an essential RNA component, pRNA. To date, pRNA has been confirmed only in 29 and its relatives,52 although Acidianus bottle-shaped virus, an archaeal phage, produces RNA with a predicted secondary structure similar to pRNA.70 Binding of pRNA to the head­tail connector requires the basic RKR residues at the gp10 N-terminus23 and is the last step in morphogenesis of the mature prohead. gp16 then binds to the pRNA oligomer to constitute the active packaging motor, and this binding was strictly dependent on and mediated by the presence of pRNA (Figs. 5 and 6). Ribonuclease footprints of gp16 on the prohead/pRNA showed protection of residues of the A-helix, extending to residues 18 and 19, which correspond to CC of the CCA bulge (Fig. 7). This result was confirmed by demonstration that mutant pRNA lacking the A-helix did not bind gp16 (Fig. 5c) and by cryo-EM reconstruction of the prohead/gp16 motor assembly intermediate, which showed that gp16 was bound to the A-helix spokes of pRNA (Fig. 7). The 120-base pRNA CCA bulge mutant has prohead binding competitor activity but no DNA­gp3 packaging activity.33 Even though the CC residues in the pRNA CCA bulge contribute to the gp16 binding, they were not required for the initial pRNA­gp16 interaction (Fig. 4 and Table 2). This is similar to a previous report that the CCA bulge is dispensable for gp16 binding.50 The His­gp16­thioredoxin was found to bind DNA nonspecifically and to bind the pRNA/ prohead more strongly than the pRNA-free capsid, although none of these complexes was tested for DNA packaging activity.50 The RNase footprinting of gp16 on the prohead (Fig. 7) should help model the gp16­ pRNA interaction. Endonuclease activity possessed by other phage large terminase subunits is not needed in 29 as the DNA is unit length and not packaged from a DNA concatemer. In cryo-EM reconstruction, the pRNA and gp16 subunits have 5-fold symmetry and are intimately associated (Fig. 7). This and the fact that gp16 is a pRNA-dependent ATPase24 lend credence to the idea that the ATPase subunits of the motor may be gp16/ pRNA heterodimers. Once the gp16 has bound to pRNA, the pRNA subunits have been shown by cryo-EM reconstruction to make contacts with the capsid, which rationalizes the finding that the ring of motor subunits is 5-fold symmetric.30 Thus, pRNA ultimately links the gp16 to the capsid, and whether and how tightly pRNA remains associated with the connector are unknown. The connector is shown by cryo-EM reconstruction to be essentially situated in a basket formed by pRNA.30 In conflict with the above scenario, Ibarra et al.49 reported that, by the use of ELISA and immunoprecipitation experiments, the connector N-terminus can bind gp16, as V8-treated connectors that lack the N-terminus did not interact with gp16; pRNA­gp16 interaction was also reported in this study. The gp16 used was in high excess in these experiments (3137/prohead, 115/connector, and 3.3 × 104/RNA), and none of these complexes was shown to be active in DNA packaging.

Viral Packaging Motor Intermediate

It is not known if the pRNA molecules retain their novel intermolecular base pairing interactions71,72 in the active packaging motor, which might serve as a means of communication among the ATPases in the coordination of motor function. The pRNA subunits have been hypothesized to function sequentially, as incorporation of one inactive subunit of a mutant pRNA has been reported to be sufficient to stop DNA packaging.27,73 Tests of the sequential mode of action of gp16 (and the proposed pRNA/gp16 heterodimers) are an aim of single-molecule packaging studies in process. 29 gp3, covalently bound at the DNA 5 termini (DNA­gp3), is needed for DNA packaging in bulk and has been viewed as a small terminase protein.10 gp3 also greatly enhances the efficiency and selectivity of DNA packaging in bulk in vitro.44 In phage P22, the small terminase subunit gp3 is shown to bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner and is a globular decamer in solution with a central annulus that can fit the DNA.60 In the phage  small terminase subunit gpNu1, the NMR structure shows a helix­ turn­helix (HTH) motif for DNA binding,74 and the T4 gp16 small terminase also has a predicted HTH motif, whereas gp3 of 29 lacks an HTH motif.75 The general strategy for genome packaging is thus retained in 29 despite the apparent divergence from the conventional model with active participation of pRNA in the packaging motor function. gp16 supercoils the DNA­gp3 packaging substrate in a reaction that is dependent on gp3 covalently bound at the DNA termini.21 This supercoiled DNA­ gp3/gp16 complex is preferentially packaged into proheads in vitro. Thus, the description here of a stable and active prohead/pRNA/gp16 complex that can package DNA without additional gp16 (Fig. 6) represents an alternative pathway of gp16 assembly and packaging initiation. Notably, however, this prohead/pRNA/gp16 intermediate was also capable of supercoiling DNA­gp3, just as demonstrated earlier with gp16 on free DNA­gp3 in the absence of proheads (Fig. 9).21 Figure 10 illustrates the alternative pathways for producing the prohead/pRNA/gp16/ DNA­gp3 packaging initiation complex. Various mixtures of the proheads/pRNA, gp16, and DNA­ gp3, without or with ATP, or complexes stalled in the packaging process with S-ATP at different times, were prepared in BAC films,76 mounted on support films, rotary metal shadowed, and observed by transmission EM (data not shown) to directly observe the events of initiation and progression of DNA­gp3 packaging in vitro. DNA in the process of packaging appeared to be supercoiled and condensed, but the provisional results have not yet provided a clear picture of the structure of the initiation complex or the progression of packaging. Proheads and DNA­ gp3 were isolated at times ranging from 45 to 90 min from a lysate of a restrictive infection of B. subtilis with the 29 mutant sus14(1241), which provides delayed lysis, in another attempt to determine the pathway and events in packaging initiation. gp16 was found in multiple copies on both the DNA­gp3 and the proheads (data not shown).

Fig. 10. Alternative pathways for producing the prohead/pRNA/gp16/DNA­gp3 packaging initiation complex. (a) DNA­gp3 forms a lariat by interaction of the terminal gp3 with DNA, independent of sequence, and gp16 binds to the lariat loop junction to effect supercoiling of the DNA in concert with gp3; this supercoiled DNA­gp3­gp16 complex is preferentially packaged.21 (b) gp16 binds the prohead/pRNA to constitute a packaging intermediate that can be isolated and is fully active without additional gp16. This prohead/pRNA/gp16 complex is hypothesized to bind and supercoil DNA­gp3 at the prohead portal vertex. Scaffolding protein exits as packaging proceeds upon hydrolysis of ATP, and the tail components are sequentially assembled on the DNA-filled head to yield 29.

supercoiled DNA by the free 29 head­tail connector to remove negative supercoils77 is a provocative reminder that the initiation of packaging may involve DNA­protein transactions within the motor that have not been contemplated. Further experimentation is needed to dissect the details of packaging initiation. Isolation of the prohead/pRNA­gp16 motor assembly intermediate has facilitated single-molecule studies that allow DNA translocation to be measured from initiation to completion, allowing study of the previously uncharacterized early steps of packaging and the demonstration of packaging forces N100 pN.4,78 Prohead/pRNA/gp16 assembly intermediates were attached to one bead, biotinylated DNA molecules were tethered to streptavidin-coated microspheres, and packaging was initiated by bringing the beads into contact in the presence of ATP. In these single-molecule studies, gp3 is not required, whereas DNA without gp3 is packaged 1 order of magnitude less efficiently in bulk.44 The prohead/pRNA/gp16 complex and DNA are rapidly brought into close physical contact in the laser tweezers, possibly bypassing the need for gp3. It is also noteworthy that use of DNA­gp3 in the single-molecule studies results in great variation in DNA tether length upon initiation, indicating that the DNA­gp3 molecules have a higher-order structure.4

Preparation of proheads Proheads with 174-base pRNA were purified from a lysate of B. subtilis SpoOA12 (sup-) cells infected with the mutant sus16(300)­sus14(1241), which is defective for the DNA packaging ATPase gp16 as described previously.30 Production and purification of soluble gp16 from B. subtilis The purified E/D segment of 29 DNA­gp3 containing gene 16 was obtained by partial digestion with EcoRI42 and cloned into the plasmid pUB18, which encodes kanamycin resistance. The sucrose inducible promoter SACB43 was inserted before the gp16 gene, and the resulting pSACB-gp16 plasmid was moved into B. subtilis WB30 (asporogenic and protease negative) by protoplast transformation.79 The maximum yield of the soluble protein (10 mg/l) was obtained after induction of gene 16 expression with 2% sucrose for 3 h at 37 °C. The expression of gp16 in B. subtilis did not result in inclusion body formation as in E. coli,20 and about 70% of the protein was found in the soluble fraction (supernatant). Sucroseinduced cells were passed through a French press twice in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C in a SS34 rotor. The supernatant was subjected to P11 phosphocellulose (Whatman) cation exchange chromatography. The P11 column was equilibrated with lysis buffer, washed with 8 bed volumes of 300 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.8, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM TCEP, and gp16 was eluted with 350 mM NaCl in the same buffer. The P11 eluate containing gp16 was further purified on a hydroxyapatite column (Biorad), which was equilibrated with 300 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris­ HCl, pH 7.8, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM TCEP.

The protein was eluted by a 10-bedvolume gradient of 100 to 900 mM NaCl in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM TCEP. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and peak fractions containing pure gp16 were stored in aliquots at -70 °C. The identity of the protein was confirmed by a Western blot developed with polyclonal anti-gp16 serum. The average yield of the purified gp16 was 8 mg/l of culture. In vitro DNA­gp3 packaging Packaging in the defined in vitro system was performed as described previously.44 DNA­gp3 (1 g) and proheads were mixed in a ratio of 1:2 in a total volume of 20 l in 0.5× TMS buffer (25 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM NaCl) containing 0.5 mM ATP. Generally, 15 copies (molecules) of gp16 per prohead were added, and the mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 15 min. The gp16 copy number varied as indicated. DNase I was added to 1 g/ml to digest the unpackaged DNA, while the packaged DNA was protected in the head. The DNase was inhibited and the packaged DNA was extracted from the filled heads by adding EDTA to 25 mM and proteinase K to 500 g/ml, and the efficiency of packaging was quantified following electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel run in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 89 mM boric acid, and 2.5 mM EDTA). Sedimentation equilibrium Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with purified gp16 equilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 400 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP at 4 °C. Two samples at each concentration of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/ml were analyzed in an An50Ti rotor in a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical centrifuge. Data were collected at 280 nm and at three rotor speeds of 5000, 8000, and 11,000 rpm. Equilibrium was reached when scans taken 4 h apart were superimposable. Each data curve was the result of at least three averaged scans. The partial specific volume () for gp16 calculated from the primary amino acid sequence using SEDNTERP47 was 0.7375 ml/g. Based on the primary amino acid sequence, the calculated monomer molecular weight of gp16 was 38,965. With the use of SEDNTERP, the calculated density () of the buffer was 1.02859 g/ml and the viscosity () was 0.0167043. Data were initially fit to a self-association model using NONLIN,46 which yielded molecular weights suggestive of a trimer. Additional species that were included as fits were not good for a simple monomer-to-trimer model. The data at lower centrifugation speeds and higher protein concentrations were fit using SEDPHAT.48 gp16 forms higher-molecular-weight species that are not reversible and are lost to the bottom of the cell. The area of absorbance for each cell was determined at each centrifuge speed relative to the initial absorbance at 3000 rpm to determine the amount of loss. This amounted to loss of 40% of the gp16 at 0.2­0.4 mg/ml and that of 65% at 0.8 mg/ml. The protein remaining in solution was fit as described above. Gel filtration Gel filtration was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8,

400 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP on an Akta FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Molecular weight standards were analyzed in the same buffer and contained thyroglobulin (669,000), human immunoglobulin G (158,000), ovalbumin (44,000), myoglobin (17,600), and vitamin B12 (1355). Transmission EM Glow discharge-treated holey carbon films on 400-mesh copper grids were floated on samples of purified gp16 (50 g/ml in 50 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, and 400 mM NaCl), negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate, and imaged at a magnification of 57,000×. Micrographs were made with a Philips EM301 electron microscope. The diameter of gp16 particles from the electron micrographs was determined by the use of Image J (National Institutes of Health). Calibration was done from micrographs of a carbon-grating replica (Fullam, NY). Preparation of pRNA The 120- and 106-base pRNA forms were generated by in vitro T7 transcription from pRT72 plasmid linearized with DdeI and ApaLI (Invitrogen), respectively, as described previously.33 Alternatively, 120-base pRNA was produced from in vitro transcription of the BamHI-linearized pH120RNAH plasmid (Atz et al., unpublished results). The 71-base pRNA expression construct pH71RNAH was generated by two rounds of PCR from the pRNA gene and by adding hammerhead ribozyme sequences to both ends of the template to generate uniform pRNA ends. The plasmid was cloned into pUC19 and transformed into E. coli DH5. The purified plasmid was linearized with SmaI and transcribed in vitro to obtain the 71-base pRNA. R7 pRNA was generated from B. subtilis 12A (pUM102) as described previously.33 All forms of pRNA were purified by electrophoresis in denaturing urea acrylamide gels.80 Individual pRNA bands were located by UV shadowing over polyethyleneimine UV254­cellulose plates with a 254nm light source. pRNA bands were excised, and the pRNA eluted twice by diffusion into TEN buffer (10 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl) for 3 h at 4 °C. EMSA The 120-base pRNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of gp16 in 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM NaCl for 20 min at room temperature. Glycerol (5%), bromophenol blue (0.05%), and xylene cyanol (0.05%) were added to each reaction, the complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel in TB buffer (89 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.3, and 89 mM boric acid) for 3 h, and the gels were stained with ethidium bromide. EMSA was also performed with HpaI-digested 29 DNA fragments and gp16 in a similar manner. Preparation of RNA-free proheads Purified proheads were diluted 10-fold in TMS buffer and digested with 1 g/ml of RNase A for 15 min at room temperature.44 These RNA-free proheads were purified on a 10%­40% sucrose density gradient in TMS buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM NaCl) by centrifugation for 3 h at 35,000 rpm in an SW55

liquid ethane. Images were recorded at a magnification of 39,000× with a CM200 FEG microscope, with electron dose levels of approximately 20 e-/Å2. All micrographs were digitized at 4.24 Å pixel- 1 using a Zeiss SCAI scanner. Individual particle images were boxed, floated, and preprocessed to normalize mean intensities and variances and to remove linear background gradients. Reference projections of a previously published prohead reconstruction30 were used to initially classify particles for threedimensional reconstruction. The resulting model was used to recalculate reference projections for better particle classification. Several cycles of iterative particle classification and reconstruction were performed until convergence had been reached. Structure factor phases and amplitudes were modified as indicated by the parameters of the contrast transfer function. All steps of the reconstruction process, including determination of the contrast transfer function parameters, were performed with the program EMAN.81 Fivefold symmetry was assumed in the reconstruction. The number of particles incorporated in the final reconstruction was 1705, and the final resolution of the reconstruction was 18.5 Å, as determined by the Fourier shell correlation method using a correlation coefficient of 0.5 between independent half data sets as the cutoff criterion. Sedimentation assay of DNA­gp16 and DNA­prohead/pRNA/gp16 [3H]DNA­gp3 (1 g) was diluted in water and heated for 5 min at 37 °C. A 0.1 volume of 10× TM buffer and 12 copies of gp16 per DNA were added to give a final reaction volume of 100 l. The mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged in a 5%­20% linear sucrose density gradient containing TM buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.6, and 5 mM MgCl2) in the SW55 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 2 h at 20 °C. Fractions were collected, and the [3H]DNA­gp3 was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Also, samples of the fractions were treated with 5 g/ml of DNase I at room temperature for 20 min, and dot blots of the samples were developed with gp16 antiserum. As a control, gp16 alone was sedimented on a sucrose gradient and samples of the fractions were used for dot blots and gp16 quantification. Prohead/ pRNA/gp16 complexes (12 copies of gp16 per prohead) were prepared, incubated with [3H]DNA­gp3, and sedimented in a sucrose gradient to study their activity in binding and supercoiling DNA­gp3 as described previously.21 Extract preparation B. subtilis SpoOA12 (sup-) was infected with the mutant sus7(614)­sus8(769)­sus14(1241), which is defective for the prohead scaffold and capsid proteins and is a source of gp16, and extracts of these infected cells were prepared as described previously.16

rotor. The prohead band was collected, and the particles were pelleted in TMS buffer. Reconstitution of pRNA-free proheads with pRNA Ten copies of the pRNA produced from in vitro transcription were used per prohead, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature for reconstitution. These reconstituted proheads were repurified on a sucrose gradient to remove excess pRNA. Isolation of the prohead/pRNA/gp16 ATPase motor assembly intermediate Proheads with 174-base pRNA and gp16 were incubated in TMS buffer without ATP at ambient temperature for 20 min at a ratio of 20 gp16 molecules per prohead. After incubation, the reaction mixture was loaded on a 5%­20% sucrose gradient in TM buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.6, and 5 mM MgCl2) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 30 min in an SW55 rotor at 4 °C. The peak band was collected with a syringe, and 20 l was used for testing the in vitro DNA­ gp3 packaging activity upon addition of DNA­gp3 and ATP. A total of 100 l of the fraction was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE to determine the composition of the prohead/pRNA/gp16 intermediate. pRNA-free proheads and proheads reconstituted with various forms of pRNA with A-helix deletions (71-base, 106-base and R7 pRNA, Fig. 4b­d) were used to screen for binding of gp16 as described above. RNase footprinting The 120-base pRNA was 5 end-labeled with OptikinaseTM (USB Corp.) and [-32P]ATP after removal of the 5 terminal phosphate with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The end-labeled pRNA was further purified by electrophoresis in denaturing urea acrylamide gels. The pRNA bands were eluted from the gel into TEN buffer and concentrated by isopropanol precipitation. pRNA obtained after precipitation was used for footprinting and reconstitution of pRNA-free proheads for footprinting. A total of 140 g of pRNA-free proheads was reconstituted with 2.8 g of 5 end-labeled 120-base pRNA (6 pRNA/prohead; 7 × 105 CPM/g of pRNA) in TM buffer for 20 min at room temperature. Proheads were separated from the unbound pRNA by dilution into 5 ml of TM buffer and pelleting at 35,000 rpm for 5 h in the SW55 rotor at 4 °C as described previously.26 Prohead-bound [32P]pRNA, [32P]pRNA alone (2 × 104 CPM), and [32P]pRNA complexed with gp16 were digested with varying concentrations of RNase A (Ambion), RNase T1, or RNase V1 (Ambion) in 10-l reactions for 15 min at ambient temperature. pRNA was extracted with 200 l of a mixture containing one part 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA, and 20 g/ml of yeast tRNA (Ambion) and one part phenol. The aqueous phases were precipitated with 0.6 volumes of isopropanol containing 20 g/ml of glycogen. Pellets were resuspended in 4 M urea, 20% glycerol, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% bromophenol blue and run on a 10% denaturing 8.3 M urea polyacrylamide gel. Cryo-EM Proheads with 174-base pRNA and prohead/174-base pRNA/gp16 particles were flash-frozen on holey grids in
