Zinc/calcium- and cadmium/cadmium-substituted concanavalin A: interplay of metal binding, pH and molecular packing
The crystal structures of cadmium/cadmium and zinc/calcium concanavalin A (con A) at pH 5.0 and pH 6.15, respectively, were determined. The structure of cadmium/cadmium con A con®rms that the secondary Cd2+-binding site S3 is empty at pH 5. The metal-binding sites S1 and S2 are only very slightly affected by the substitution with cadmium. On the other hand, S1 and S2 and most of the protein surface of zinc/calcium con A at pH 6.15 differ from other fully metal-bound and carbohydrate-free structures. Most of these structural differences at the protein surface are a result of the interplay between metal binding, protonation and crystal packing. This interplay is expressed by relative rotations and translations of the con A units in alternative crystal packings and participation in space-group conversions inside crystals in situ. The particular crystal packing of zinc/calcium con A creates a novel zinc-binding site S4. The Zn2+ ion in S4 ligates two aspartates from one tetramer and a histidine from a symmetryrelated tetramer.

1. Introduction
The Leguminosae lectins form a large family of closely related proteins that cover a wide range of carbohydrate speci®cities (Loris et al., 1998). Despite the structural conservation of their monomeric units, they associate into a variety of quaternary structures, sometimes resembling those of known animal lectins (Bouckaert et al., 1999; Vijayan & Chandra, 1999). At present, the crystal structures of 20 members of the legume lectin family and their complexes with various carbohydrates are available in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000), making it one of the best-studied group of carbohydraterecognizing proteins. Of these, concanavalin A isolated from Canavalia ensiformis (con A) is the most extensively studied legume lectin. The binding of metal ions in a binuclear binding site, S1 and S2, is essential for the carbohydrate-binding activity of con A (Sumner & Howell, 1936; Derewenda et al., 1989) and for all legume lectins in general. Con A binds saccharides only when the active carbohydrate-binding protein is stabilized by the occupation of the calcium-binding site S2 (Bouckaert, Loris, Poortmans et al., 1996). Metal-ion binding in S2 induces and maintains the cis isomer of the Ala207±Asp208 peptide bond characteristic of the locked form of con A and in contrast to the metal-free unlocked form of con A containing this peptide bond in the usual trans conformation (Bouckaert et al., 1995; Brown et al., 1977; Bouckaert et al., 2000). Binding in S2 is itself conditional on the binding of one of several divalent metal ions [Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+ or Zn2+ (Shoham et al., 1973; Bouckaert, Loris, Poortmans et al., 1996); at neutral pH

also Ca2+ (Koenig et al., 1978)] at the transition metal binding site S1. The predominant species of the naturally occurring lectin is MnCa con A; that is, fully metal-bound and locked con A where Mn2+ occupies the S1 site and Ca2+ is bound in S2. The crystal structures of CdCd con A at pH 5 and in space group I222, and ZnCa con A at pH 6.15 and in space group P21212 are presented here. They will be referred to as CdCdpH5.0 con A and ZnCapH6.15 con A, respectively. These two lower pH structures will be compared with other locked fully metal-bound carbohydrate-free structures at neutral pH. A reference structure for comparison is ZnCapH7.1 con A. It corresponds to the same molecular species as ZnCapH6.15 conA, having Zn2+ bound at S1 and Ca2+ at S2, but is at a different pH and in a different crystal form (Bouckaert, Loris, Poortmans et al., 1996). Other structures for comparison of, in particular, the metal-binding sites are CdCapH6.5 con A (PDB entry 1con; Naismith et al., 1993) and MnCapH6.5 con A (PBD entry 2ctv; Emmerich et al., 1994). The structure of unlocked metal-freepH5.0 con A (PDB entry 1apn; Bouckaert et al., 1995) is very useful to distinguish changes on the protein surface caused by the low pH or by the demetallization. This collection of con A structures enables the assignment of particular structural features to metal-ion substitutions, pH changes and/

Metal-free con A and crystals thereof were prepared as described previously (Bouckaert et al., 1995). All tools for manipulating the metal-free protein or metal-substituted protein crystals were rinsed extensively with deionized water kept in batch with Chelex-100 beads (BIORAD) prior to use, in order to prevent contamination of the protein with trace metals. All crystallization solutions were batch-treated with Chelex-100. All crystals were mounted in calcium-free borosilicate capillaries. After data collection, the metal content of the crystals was checked on a scanning electron microscope with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer to ensure the presence of the required metal ions and the absence of undesired ones. ZnCapH6.15 con A was prepared by co-crystallization of metal-free con A with zinc and calcium. Sitting drops were composed initially of equal volumes (30 ml) of reservoir solution [1.8 M (NH4)2SO4, 100 mM CH3COONa pH 6.15] and protein solution (6 mg mlÀ1 of metal-free con A, 10 mM ZnCl2 and 10 mM CaCl2). X-ray data were collected using Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode Cu K radiation in combination with a MAR Research image-plate detector. The data were indexed and integrated with MOSFLM. Subsequent scaling and merging and conversion to structure factors was performed using the programs ROTAVATA and AGROVATA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). CdCdpH5.0 con A was prepared by soaking crystals of metalfree con A for 3 h in 60 ml of the mother liquor at pH 5.0 containing 5 mM CdCl2. The crystals thus treated were subsequently stored at 277 K for at least two weeks in borosilicate capillaries. X-ray data were collected using an Enraf±Nonius rotating-anode source operated at 40 kV, 70 mA and a FAST area detector. The data were integrated using MADNES (Messerschmidt & P¯ugrath, 1987) and subsequently scaled and merged using ROTAVATA and AGROVATA.
2.2. Molecular replacement and refinement

The ZnCapH6.15 con A structure was solved by molecular replacement. A canonical dimer of the con A±mannose complex (Naismith et al., 1994) was used as the search model, resulting in an initial correlation factor of 0.40 and a crystallographic R factor of 0.52. Re®nement was carried out È entirely with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). After an initial slowcool stage (3000 K) to remove potential model bias, the R È factor dropped to 0.26 and the free R factor (Brunger, 1997) to 0.33. At this stage, electron densities were inspected and the metal ions were added to the structure. This was followed by alternating rounds of manual rebuilding and restrained positional and B-factor re®nement (without any ' cutoffs and

updating the bulk-solvent correction after each re®nement round or rebuilding session). The re®nement of the ZnCapH6.15 con A structure was evaluated by cross-correlation using Rfree; a bulk-solvent correction was applied and updated throughout the re®nement. Re®nement of CdCdpH5.0 con A started from the coordiÊ nates for the isomorphous structure of CdCa con A at 1.85 A (PDB entry 1con). After an initial rigid-body re®nement, positional and individual B-factor re®nements were performed as for the ZnCapH6.15 con A structure except that no free R factor was used. This is because CdCdpH5.0 con A was originally re®ned when Rfree or bulk-solvent correction were not yet in common use. For both structures, no metal±ligand bond-distance restraints were employed and the metal ions were given no charge. Water molecules were added only if (i) the water had at least one hydrogen-bonding partner, (ii) the positive difference density level was higher than 3' and (iii) after re®nement the electron density of the putative water reappeared in the 2Fo À Fc map at a level of at least 1'.
3.1. Overall structure of CdCdpH5.0 con A

CdCdpH5.0 con A has cadmium bound in both metal-binding sites S1 and S2 (Fig. 2a). It originates from crystals of metalfree unlocked con A, which after soaking with cadmium for two weeks at 277 K convert from space group P21212 to I222. With this space-group conversion, the asymmetric unit changes from a dimer to a monomer and the protein obtains its active `locked' conformation. The locking of the structure coincides with a space-group conversion with an increase in crystallographic symmetry (Figs. 3b and 3c). The structure of CdCdpH5.0 con A is most similar to CdCapH6.5 con A (Fig. 4), with an r.m.s. difference for the Ê main-chain atoms of the 119 -sheet residues of 0.10 A. The r.m.s. deviation increases for isomorphous structures at still Ê higher pH values (e.g. 0.19 A with ZnCapH7.1 con A). The overall temperature factors of CdCdpH5.0 con A are higher than for con A structures at neutral pH. The most plausible factor causing these differences between isomorphous low and neutral pH structures of con A is dissociation of the con A tetramers into dimers below pH 6.5 (Bouckaert, Loris & Wyns,

3. Results and discussion
Both CdCdpH5.0 con A and ZnCapH6.15 con A are locked carbohydrate-binding structures of con A containing the unusual cis peptide bond between Ala207 and Asp208. The data collection, re®nement statistics and the ®nal number of water molecules are shown in Table 1. The overall structure of con A consisting of a -sandwich (Fig. 1) is conserved and will not be discussed in further detail.

stabilization of con A by recent microcalorimetric measurements (Sanders et al., 1998). The stabilization is removed below pH 6.4, where no Cd2+ is bound at S3 (Sanders et al., 1998), in agreement with the CdCdpH5.0 con A structure. Above this pH, a structure of CdCd con A with a ®lled S3 site could exist, con®rming previous NMR results of the binding of three cadmium ions per con A molecule (Palmer et al., 1980). The S3 site is located closely to the con A dimer interface (Fig. 3), but is not involved in crystal packing.

1996). In solution at pH values between 5 and 7, a mixture of dimers and tetramers is observed (Senear & Teller, 1981a). The CdCdpH5.0 con A structure does not contain a Cd2+ ion bound to the S3 site (Figs. 1 and 3) as identi®ed earlier in the structure of CdCapH6.5 con A (Naismith et al., 1993), and the S3 ligand Asp136, Glu87 and Glu183 have their native sidechain conformation. Cd2+ binding at S3 was correlated with

The ZnCapH6.15 con A crystals were grown by co-crystallization of metalfree unlocked con A with zinc and calcium ions. ZnCapH6.15 con A shows 4.21 4.18 signi®cant deviations in some surface loops both from the structures of ZnCapH7.1 con A (PDB entry 1enr) pH5.0 and of metal-free con A (PDB entry 1apn) (Figs. 1 and 4).

For comparison, typical r.m.s. differences for the same atoms among isomorphous crystals of different metal-ion substituted con As vary

In contrast, in metal-freepH5.0 con A and ZnCapH6.15 con A crystals the tetramers are rotated 7 around the crystallographic z axis. ZnCapH6.15 con A also undergoes a rather large translation along the b unit-cell dimension.

Ê between 0.10 and 0.19 A. Between non-isomorphous con A Ê structures, larger r.m.s. differences ranging from 0.19 to 0.24 A are typically observed. The temperature factors of the ZnCapH6.15 con A dimer are also high overall compared with ZnCapH7.1 con A or even the unlocked metal-freepH5.0 con A (Table 2). Structural differences that do not involve con A tetramer formation (see below) are located at Ser21 and in the loops Ser160±Pro165, Ser223±Ser225, Lys135±Asp136, Thr148± Asp151, Pro202±Pro206 and Leu81±Asn83 (Figs. 1 and 4). Since the pH of crystallization of ZnCapH6.15 con A is intermediate between that of metal-freepH5.0 con A and ZnCapH7.1 con A, these differences are most likely to re¯ect the combined effects of the crystal environment and pH on these solvent-exposed loops. The side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser21 is in a packing contact with Lys135 N in ZnCapH7.1 con A crystals. This interaction is absent in both metal-freepH5.0 con A and ZnCapH6.15 con A. Exclusively in ZnCapH6.15 con A crystals, Ser223 O interacts with Asp136 O2. Both changes are because of a different relative orientation of the con A molecules in the crystal packing. The surface loops Ser160± Pro165 and Thr148±Asp151 are not involved in any packing contact, but are ill-determined by the electron density. The two other loops, Pro202±Pro206 and Leu81±Asn83, are involved in the formation of a secondary binding site for Zn2+. This novel Zn2+-binding site is created at the interface of two tetramers of ZnCapH6.15 con A and will be discussed in detail below. The crystal packing of ZnCapH6.15 con A is related to those of metal-free con A and ZnCapH7.1 con A. Compared with ZnCapH7.1 con A, the con A tetramers in the ZnCapH6.15 con A crystals undergo a small rotation of 7 around z as well as a translation that creates an alternative crystal packing (Fig. 3). A similar rotation is observed in the structure of metalfreepH5.0 con A; however, the translational component is different. This rotation changes the space-group symmetry from I222 to P21212 and leaves the z axis as the only crystallographic twofold axis.
3.3. Structural consequences of the metal-ion substitutions

In CdCdpH5.0 con A, the identity of the Cd2+ ions in both S1 and S2 was obvious from the strong electron density (Fig. 2a), involving 46 electrons compared with 18 electrons for Ca2+ and 23 electrons for Mn2+. The structural impact of the metalion substitution relative to native con A (MnCapH6.5 con A) or other isomorphous structures (e.g. CdCapH6.5 con A, ZnCapH7.1 con A) remains limited to the metal-binding sites S1 and S2. CdCdpH5.0 con A metal±ligand distances are increased signi®cantly (Table 2) compared with MnCapH6.5 con A or ZnCapH7.1 con A. In S1 as well as in S2 the Cd2+ ion extends its coordination shell. This may be a consequence of the lack of ligand-®eld stabilization energy because of the ®lled d shell of Cd2+. In contrast, the internuclear S1±S2 distance between the Cd2+ ions is however only slightly increased (Table 2). This supports the structural preservation of the binuclear metal-binding site in con A, despite the substitutions with Cd2+, and is in agreement with the ®nding that the coordination of structures with Cd2+ substituted for Ca2+ are mostly found to be identical to the coordination in the Ca2+-bound protein (Glusker, 1991). In conclusion, Cd2+ can replace Ca2+ ef®ciently. In ZnCapH6.15 con A, the coordination shells of the Zn2+ and Ca2+ ions in S1 and S2 are essentially identical to those in ZnCapH7.1 con A (Fig. 2b; Emmerich et al., 1994). However, the electron densities of the side chains ligating the two metal ions are not always well de®ned. On average, smaller metal±ligand Figure 4 distances are expected in S1 for Plots of the r.m.s. deviations per residue number between (a) ZnCapH6.15 con A and metal-freepH5.0 con A, Zn2+ than for Mn2+ (Glusker, pH5.0 pH6.5 pH6.15 pH7.1 (b) CdCd con A and CdCa con A, (c) ZnCa con A and ZnCa con A and (d) metal1991). This is indeed the case in freepH5.0 con A and ZnCapH7.1 con A. Residues 16±21 and 162±165 are not included in the metal-free con A structure. the structure of ZnCapH7.1 con A

compared with that of MnCapH6.5 con A. The contrary is true in ZnCapH6.15 con A (Table 2). The metal±ligand distances for the Ca2+ ion in S2 have also increased (Table 2) and are even larger than for Cd2+ in S2 in CdCdpH6.5 con A. The S1±S2 distance is signi®cantly larger than in MnCapH6.5 con A or ZnCapH7.1 con A. Thus, the metal-binding sites in crystals of ZnCapH6.15 con A appear much more disturbed than in other carbohydrate-free crystal structures of con A containing different metal ions in S1 (Emmerich et al., 1994). The latter crystals all have space group I222, in which crystal packing interactions further stabilize the metal- and carbohydratebinding region (Bouckaert et al., 2000).
3.4. A novel Zn2+-binding site in ZnCapH6.15 con A

The crystal packing of the ZnCapH6.15 con A crystals involves a secondary Zn2+-binding site (Fig. 5a) at the interface of two tetramers of ZnCapH6.15 con A. This novel Zn2+binding site will be referred to as site S4. S4 is distinct from the two major metal-binding sites S1 and S2 and is also distinct from the Cd2+-binding site S3 identi®ed by Naismith and colleagues inside the subunit structure of CdCa con A (Naismith et al., 1993; Fig. 1). The Zn2+-binding site is generÊ ated by the translation of two ZnCapH6.15 con A tetramers 5 A away from each other when compared with the molecular packing in metal-freepH5.0 con A crystals (Fig. 3). The translation is in the direction of the crystallographic b axis and leads to a larger b unit-cell parameter in ZnCapH6.15 con A crystals. Two surface loops, Pro202±Pro206 and Leu81±Asn83, are involved in the formation of S4, as mentioned above. The Zn2+ ion is ligated by the carboxylate groups of Asp80 and Asp82

and by the N42 atom of the symmetry-related histidine His205 of the neighbouring tetramer (Fig. 5a) in both monomers present in the asymmetric unit of ZnCapH6.15 con A. In both metal-freepH5.0 con A and ZnCapH7.1 con A (Fig. 5c), the side chain of His205 is too far removed to create the same S4 binding site as in ZnCapH6.15 con A. However, when metalfreepH5.0 con A crystals are soaked with Mn2+ (PDB entry 1dq4), an Mn2+ ion is bound at Asp80 and Asp82 (Fig. 5b). In this structure, the complementing His205 is replaced by Asp203 in one of two non-crystallographically related sites (Fig. 5b). These Mn2+-binding sites are present in their actual form in metal-freepH5.0 con A crystals so that the ions can instantly ®ll the sites. In the second monomer, Asp80 and Asp82 alone constitute the Mn2+-binding site and His205 makes a hydrogen bond to Asp82. This hydrogen bond is also found in the related Zn2+- and Co2+-soaked metal-freepH5.0 con A crystals (PDB entries 1ces and 1ens; Bouckaert, Loris, Poortmans et al., 1996). The latter structures contain almost no Zn2+ or Co2+ at the S4 site between Asp80, Asp82 and Asp203. Apparently, the Mn2+ site, which is composed solely of aspartate side chains, is less suitable for Zn2+ or Co2+ ions. Interestingly, this structure will further change to MnMn con A over a longer time period by rotation of the con A tetramers to gain crystallographic 222 symmetry. Asp80 and Asp82 are thereby separated from His205, similar to in ZnCapH7.1 con A (Fig. 5c) where no Zn2+ ion can be bound at S4. An earlier X-ray absorption ®ne-structure investigation has described the Zn2+ ion in S1 in a polycrystalline slurry of ZnCa con A prepared at pH 6.5 (Lin et al., 1990). These authors found a lower than six Zn2+ coordination number, different from the coordination number calculated from solution EXAFS studies, and concluded that the crystal lattice may

have a profound effect on the structure of the metal-binding sites. Our results suggest another explanation of the differences found between EXAFS data derived from solution studies and from the solid state. The crystal form present in the polycrystalline slurry used by Lin and coworkers was not characterized, but is likely to correspond to the crystal form described in the present paper. If in the polycrystalline slurry crystal packing is indeed mediated by a second Zn2+-binding site, similar to the S4 site found in ZnCapH6.15 con A, the EXAFS spectra from these crystals around the Zn2+ absorption edge would deviate signi®cantly from those of ZnCa con A in solution, even if the Zn2+ binding in the S1 site is identical. The EXAFS-derived average Zn2+±ligand distance is probably signi®cantly more accurate than the crystallographic distance, but is inevitably a weighted average over all Zn sites. In fact, a correct interpretation of the EXAFS results by simulation from ZnCapH6.15 con A crystals would be impossible owing to the inability to separate the contributions of the two different Zn2+ binding sites S1 and S4.

Residues Asn69 and Ala70 on the surface of the sixstranded back -sheet (Fig. 1), which mediate tetramer formation with loop Asn118±Thr123 of the opposing dimer in the I222 con A crystal form (CdCdpH5.0 con A as well as ZnCapH7.1 con A; Table 3), are less well de®ned by the electron density in ZnCapH6.15 con A. This is probably a consequence of ZnCapH6.15 con A lacking these extra stabilizing symmetry contacts. In addition to the hydrogen bonds listed in Table 3, a salt bridge across the tetramer interface is observed involving Asp58 and Arg60. This interaction does not have good hydrogen-bond geometry, but the distance between both charged groups is suf®ciently small to assume it to be energetically favourable. This salt bridge is disrupted in all structures below pH 6.5 because of a different side-chain conformation of Arg60. This coincides with a slightly different intersubunit orientation in the con A tetramer.

3.5. Contacts at the tetramer interface

Con A is known to behave as a dimer in solution below pH 5.0 and as a tetramer above pH 7.0. At intermediate pH values, a mixture of dimers and tetramers is present (Senear & Teller, 1981a). The pH dependence of the dimer±tetramer equilibrium of con A is of interest because some biological properties of con A have been shown to depend on the valency of con A for saccharide ligands (Mandal & Brewer, 1993). Senear & Teller (1981b) studied the dimer±tetramer equilibrium thermodynamically and found that tetramer association is governed by the ionization of a histidine side chain on each of the subunits, either His51 or His121. The protonation of the four His121 residues that are located closely together in the tetramer is thought to cause a charge repulsion and dissociation of the dimers. In the crystal structures of CdCdpH5.0 con A, ZnCapH6.15 con A and metalfreepH5.0, crystal packing generates a tetramer similar to that found in the high-pH crystal structures of con A. Hydrogen bonds mediating tetramer formation in different crystal structures of con A are given in Table 3. We ®nd that His121 makes the same interactions in CdCdpH5.0 con A, ZnCapH7.1 con A and metal-freepH5.0 con A. It behaves differently only in ZnCapH6.15 con A, where its hydrogen bond with Ser108 is replaced by an alternative one with Asn131.
