The solution structure of the DNA duplex [GTGGAATGGAAC]2 containing a tandem repeat of the human centromere (TGGAA)n unit has been determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR), distance geometry (DG) and molecular dynamics/energy minimization (MD/EM) methods. This remarkably stable ``self-complementary'' antiparallel duplex contains a tandem repeated motif in which unpaired guanine residues from opposite strands intercalate and costack between sheared G·A pairs. Twelve independent refined structures were determined from the NMR data and found to converge to a single family of closely related structures with pair-wise r.m.s.d. values of 0.5520.25 Å. All sugar residues are in the normal C2'-endo conformation except for the unpaired guanosines, which are in the unusual C3'-endo conformation. The guanosine residues of the bracketing G·A pairs have high-antiglycosidic torsion angles and z backbone torsion angles close to the trans domain. The structure exhibits many unusual interstrand interactions, including base-sugar stacking, base-phosphate hydrogen bonding and cross-strand base stacking. The [GGA]2 unit contains a stack of four contiguous guanine residues, all of which have their hydrogen-bonding surface (N2H-N1H-O6N7) exposed to solvent and available for interaction with other bases or ligands. This unexpected property may explain the unique morphology and function of the human centromere in mitosis.

Introduction
Human centromeres, the primary constriction site in metaphase chromosomes, are morphologically distinct regions of the chromosome that contain different highly repeated satellite DNA sequences. It has long been recognized that one or more of these repetitive DNA sequences acts to nucleate formation of the kinetochore, the centromeric structure that mediates attachment to the mitotic spindle and movement of the separated chromosomes along the spindle to the poles during mitosis.

Although several different repetitive sequences have been found in the centromeric region (Willard, 1992), it is not completely clear which of these are the true functional human centromere DNA sequences. Recently, several observations suggest that the tandem repeat (TGGAA)n may be the functional centromeric sequence in humans since: (1) this repeat has been localized to the centromere of human chromosomes by fluorescence microscopy and has been conserved over more than a billion years (Grady et al., 1992); (2) this sequence is very similar to the functional yeast centromere sequence (TGGAAA)n (Carbon & Clarke, 1990); (3) it binds strongly to a nuclear protein isolated from human centromeres (Pluta et al., 1990; Grady et al., 1992); and (4) the purine-rich strand alone is able to form a stable duplex, as indicated by UV-melting (Grady et al., 1992), containing a new and unusual structural motif (Chou et al., 1994b). In our previous communication concerning the

solution structure of centromere repeats (Chou et al., 1994b), we presented NMR data for the duplex [GTGIAATGIAAC]2 , which is the inosine analog of the actual tandem repeat [GTGGAATGGAAC]2 ; the advantage of the inosine analog was the additional H2 distance constraints which facilitated resonance assignments and structure determination. We now present the detailed NMR data for the duplex [GTGGAATGGAAC]2 containing two tandem repeats of the natural centromere TGGAA pentamer bracketed by a G·C base-pair at each end of the duplex. The assignments of some unusually shifted protons have been confirmed by through-bond 1 H-1H and 1H-31P connectivities and the structure of the ``self-complementary'' [(TGGAA)2 ]2 repeat is presented in more detail than in our previous short communication (Chou et al., 1994b).

Results
Imino proton studies Figure 1 shows the imino proton spectra for the sequences GTGGAATGGAAC (bottom spectrum) and those of three different 4G and 9G substituents; for clarity we will designate the 9G to 9I variant dodecamer as GGA-GIA, the 4G/9G to 4A/9A double substitution as GAA-GAA etc. As indicated by their imino proton spectra, all four sequences appear to form [d(GTGPuAATGPuAAC)]2 duplexes with (GPuA)2 motifs containing two sheared G·A pairs. The imino protons of GGA-GGA were assigned from NOESY spectra in 90%H2 O/ 10%2H2 O solution as described previously (Chou et al., 1994b). As discussed in our previous communication, the 9.6 ppm imino resonances are derived from the unpaired intercalated guanines while the 10.4 ppm guanine imino resonances are from the bracketing sheared G·A pairs (Chou et al., 1994b). These assignments are corroborated by the substitutions shown in Figure 1. For example, apart from the absence of the 4G and 9G imino protons at ca. 9.6 ppm, the GAA-GAA spectrum is the same as the GGA-GGA spectrum with broader (less stable) resonances from the sheared G·A pairs. The unpaired inosine imino proton resonates at lower field (ca. 11.2 ppm) than its guanosine counterpart (ca. 9.6 ppm) ­ as has been noted previously (Li et al., 1991; Chou et al., 1994b). The chemical shifts of the imino protons of the GGA-GGA and GIA-GIA sequences are listed in Table 1. Non-exchangeable proton studies The chemical shifts of the non-exchangeable protons of both the GGA-GGA and GIA-GIA dodecamer duplexes are shown in Table 1; these assignments were made via NOESY experiments and confirmed by DQF.COSY experiments and 1 H-31P heteronuclear correlation spectra. It can be seen that the proton chemical shifts for most of the inosine protons in the GIA-GIA dodecamer (including the imino protons of the intercalated unpaired

Assignments of the imino protons in the GGA-GGA sequence were made from NOESY experiments in 10%D2 O/90%H2 O solution as described in our previous communication (Chou et al., 1994b). When 9G in the GGA-GGA sequence is replaced by dI in the GGA-GIA sequence, the intensity of the 9.6 ppm peak is reduced to 50% and a new broad peak (the 9I imino proton) appears at 11.1 ppm When both 4G and 9G in the GGA-GGA dodecamer are replaced by dI in the GIA-GIA sequence, the 9.6 ppm peak totally disappears and a new broad peak of two proton intensity appears at 11.1 ppm (the 9I and 4I imino protons). Finally, when the 4G and 9G residues are replaced by dA residues, only the broad two-proton peak at 10.2 ppm from the sheared G·A pairs remains in the 9 to 12 ppm region.

inosine residues in the [GIA]2 motif) consistently resonate to lower field than the corresponding guanosine protons in the GGA-GGA dodecamer. The base H8/H6/H2-H1'/H3' region of the [GTGGAATGGAAC]2 dodecamer NOESY spectrum is shown in Figure 2. Except for the less deshielded chemical shifts of the 4G/9G H1' and H8 protons, the assignments are quite similar to those of the [GTGIAATGIAAC]2 duplex published previously (Chou et al., 1994b). As in the GIA-GIA analog, the expected sequential intrastrand 5AH8-4GH1' and 5AH8-4GH3' NOEs (designated b and h) and the 10AH8-9GH1' and 10AH8-9GH3' NOEs (designated b' and h') are missing, while the unexpected interstrand NOEs 5AH8-9'GH1' and 10AH8-4'GH1'

The 4G/9G intrasugar H1'H2'/H2"-H3'-H4'-H5'/H5" NOE connectivities are clearly revealed in the top parts of Figure 3.

have rather strong intranucleotide H8-H3' NOEs as expected for a C3'-endo sugar conformation. No especially strong intranucleotide base-H1' NOEs were observed, indicating that there are no residues with syn glycosidic torsion angles. In studies of the analogous centromeric (AATGG)n sequences reported by Catasti et al. (1994), these authors proposed the existence of Gsyn·Ganti ``G·G'' pairs, despite the absence of the strong intranucleotide H8-H1' NOEs characteristic of the Gsyn conformation. This apparent paradox was rationalised by invoking (without experimental evidence) a rapid syn-anti flip-flop, which we consider unlikely in a well-stacked DNA duplex. The H8/H6/H2-H5'/H5"/H2'/H2" and the H1'/ H3'/H5'/H5"-H5'/H5"/H2'/H2" NOESY regions of the GGA-GGA dodecamer are shown in Figure 3. The intrasugar NOE connectivities are clearly revealed in the upper part of the figure, which shows the H1'-H2'/H2"-H3'-H4'-H5'-H5" NOE connectivities as well as the H1'-H4' and H3'-H5'/H5" NOEs within the sugar rings of residues 4G and 9G. The inter-nucleotide 3GH1'-4GH4' (peak k) and 8GH1'-9GH4' (peak k') NOEs can also be detected, although the latter is weak. Two important interstrand NOEs between sugar protons are also

observed, namely 9GH1'-4'GH2" (peak c) and 4GH1'-9'GH2" (peak c'). Such interstrand sugarsugar NOEs have not previously been observed in DNA duplexes, except in the case of the self-intercalated ``i-motif'' structure of d(TCCCCC)4 which has detectable interstrand H1'-H1' NOEs (Gehring et al., 1993). The lower part of Figure 2 shows some important H2-related interstrand NOEs, i.e. 10AH24'GH4' (peak d'), 10AH2-4'GH5'/H5" (peaks i and i'), 5AH2-9'GH4' (peak d), and 5AH2-9'GH5'/H5" (peaks j and j'). One interstrand NOE between 10AH8-4'GH2" (peak f) and two intra-residue NOEs between H8-H4' in 4G (peak e) and in 9G (peak e') are also shown. The absence of the expected intrastrand 5AH8-4GH2" and 10AH89IH2" NOEs is indicated by the ``x'' symbols in the bottom right corner. The exceptionally high-field chemical shifts of the 4G and 9G H4' protons (2.12 ppm and 2.28 ppm respectively) can thus be established by several different intrasugar NOEs, and they can also be assigned by through-bond H1'-H2'/2"-H3'-H4' J-coupling connectivities. Figure 4 shows the H1'/H3'-H2'/H2"/H4' region of the DQF.COSY spectrum (the NOESY spectrum of this same region is shown in the bottom right quadrant in the upper spectrum in Figure 3).

Figure 4. The DQF.COSY experiment on [d(GTGGAATGGAAC)2 ] in the H1'/H3'-H2'/H2"/H4' region. This region corresponds to the bottom right quarter of the upper NOESY spectrum of Figure 3. The horizontal lines connect cross peaks of the H3' resonances to their own H2' and H2", while the H1'-H2'/2" cross-peaks are specifically indicated.

H3'-H2" coherence cross-peaks for 1G, 4G, 5A, 6A, 9G, 11A and 12C are connected by horizontal lines. The H1'-H2' and H1'-H2" coherence peaks for 3G, 4G, 8G and 9G are also connected and labelled H1'-H2'/2". Note that for 3G, 4G, 8G and 9G, the H2" (stronger NOE to H1') resonates upfield of the H2' instead of the more normal downfield position (see Figure 3 and Table 1). Furthermore, for residues 4G and 9G, the strong H1'-H2", the very weak or absent H1'-H2', the moderate H2"-H3', and the very strong H3'-H4' coherence peaks not only assign the 4G and 9G H4' protons unambiguously but also indicate a C3'-endo conformation for these two sugars. The very strong 4GH3'-4GH4' and 9GH3'9GH4' cross-peaks are clearly distinguishable from the H1'-H2', H1'-H2", H3'-H2' and H3'-H2" peaks in this spectral region by the absence of passive geminal H2'-H2" splitting. The anomalous chemical shifts of the H4' resonances of 4G and 9G can be independently confirmed by 3GH3'-4GP-4GH4' and 8GH3'-9GP-9HH4' heteronuclear 1H-31P J-coupling connectivities, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 also shows that, unlike in [GA]2 motifs, there are no BII phosphate backbone conformations in [GGA]2 motifs since the ca. -2.0 ppm downfield-shifted 31P resonances characteristic of this backbone conformation (Chou et al., 1992a,b) are not observed. The remarkably upfield positions of the H4' protons of the (unpaired) 4G and 9G residues in the [GGA]2 motif become readily understandable in the refined structure, where they are located directly over the strongly ring-current-shifting adenine bases of the adjacent sheared G·A pair in a base-sugar ``stack'' (vide infra). Similar large upfield shifts of H4' protons have also been observed in a two-residue hairpin loop (Orbons et al., 1987) and in Z-DNA (Giessner-Prettre et al., 1984). In parallel studies on centromere structure, Catasti et al. (1994) studied the analogous [AATGGAATGG]2 and [AATGGAATGGAATGG]2 duplexes, i.e. phase-shifted variants of the duplex we have studied. There are, however, serious discrepancies between our results and their reported assignments of the sugar protons for the second

(i.e. 3') guanosine of the tandem GG residues. They report a chemical shift for this guanosine H4' proton of 4.2­4.3 ppm, fully 2 ppm downfield of our assignment (see Supplementary Information, Catasti et al., 1994). Furthermore, they report the H1' of the second guanosine to be at higher field than its H3' while we find the H1' of this important guanosine at lower field than its H3' (see Table 1). This discrepancy is not due to the bracketing G·C pairs in our [GTGGAATGGAAC]2 dodecamer since our assignments remain unchanged in [TGGAATGGAA]2 decamer studies; furthermore, the 4G/9G assignments for H1', H3' and H4' reported in Table 1 are confirmed by through-bond 1H-1H and 1H-31P connectivities. While the discrepancies might conceivably result from simply phase-shifting the repeat unit, we regard this as unlikely. Obviously, the propagation of assignment errors into incorrectly identified distances will lead to serious distortions in the resulting structures. Structure determination Structures were calculated by embedding the interproton distances obtained from initial-rate NOE build-ups, and refining the resulting structures against the NOESY spectra, as described in Materials and Methods. The calculated NOESY spectra for all structures in the family of highly converged structures match the experimental spectra very well, with R factors of ca. 0.25. A typical simulated 120 ms NOESY spectrum (H8/H6 to H1'/H3' region) for one of the refined [GTGGAATGGAAC]2 structures is shown in Figure 6, alongside the experimental NOESY spectrum. Of particular interest are the cross peaks labelled 4G, 9G, c and c' indicated by arrows at the top of Figure 6. The strong 4G and 9G peaks are the intra-residue H8-H3' NOEs (see Figure 2), which can be used to establish the sugar conformation (Haasnoot et al., 1984). A C2'-endo sugar pucker (with x anti ) produces only a medium-to-weak ° intensity H8-H3' NOE (distance ca. 3.5 A), while the ° closer H8-H3' proximity (ca. 2.7 A) caused by

Figure 5. The proton-detected 31P-1H heteronuclear correlation spectrum of the GGA-GGA dodecamer. The horizontal lines connect cross peaks of (n)31P with their preceding (n - 1)H3' and with their own (n)H4'. Note the very unusual chemical shifts for 4GH4' and 9GH4', which are ca. 2 ppm upfield shifted from their normal ca. 4.2 ppm position in B-DNA to the H2'/H2" region at ca. 2.2 ppm. The 4GH5'/H5" and 9GH5'/H5" protons are also upfield shifted (see also Figures 3 and 4). The (n)31P-(n)H5'/H5" cross-peaks are also detectable for residues 2T, 4G, 5A, 9G, 10A and 12C. Also note that, unlike the sheared [GA]2 motif in a Py-G-A-Pu context (Chou et al., 1992a,b), there are no -2 ppm down-field shifted 31P resonances, indicating the absence of BII backbone conformations.

puckering C3' above the ring in a C3'-endo sugar produces a much stronger NOE. From the stack plot in Figure 6 and the contour plot in Figure 2, it is clear that the intraresidue H8-H3' cross-peaks of 4G and 9G are much stronger than those of all the other residues, indicating that these sugars are in the C3'-endo conformation, as corroborated by the COSY data in Figure 4. This conformation is relatively rare in fully hydrated DNA. The unusually strong 9GH8-8GH1' and 4GH8-3GH1' sequential NOEs (peaks c and c' in Figs 2 and 6) are also indicative of the uncommon C3'-endo sugar conformation for the unpaired 4G and 9G residues. To our knowledge, these are the strongest inter-residue H8-H1' NOEs yet reported in DNA. The final structures obtained by the combined use of distance geometry and molecular dynamics all converged well to a pairwise r.m.s.d. of ca. ° 0.5520.25 A. All 12 final structures of [d(GTGGAATGGAAC)]2 are shown superimposed in Figure 7; the energy terms for the structure are listed in Table 2. The structure has a respectably low overall energy indicating no serious bond strain or van der Waals conflict in attaining this unusual type of duplex of repeating pentamers containing only two complementary Watson-Crick pairs per pentamer unit. This reflects the surprisingly stable nature of the (GGA)2 motif, as is corroborated by optical melting data (Grady et al., 1992). In the back-calculation refinement, the individual leakage rates (external relaxation rates) of the various protons were found to be in the range 0.1 s-1 to 0.6 s-1 using the methodology described previously (Zhu & Reid, 1995). From the experimental NOE build-up rate of the H1'-H2" cross-peaks, the global correlation time was determined to be 010 ns; this is approximately twice that expected

for a 12 bp duplex and suggests dimerization, perhaps through the unpaired guanines or via end-to-end aggregation. The cytosine H5-H6 crosspeak, which is usually used to determine the overall correlation time (Zhu & Reid, 1995), was not used in the present study because it occurs only at the terminal position. Such a long rotational correlation time greatly reduces the sensitivity of COSY experiments in which antiphase coherence is involved. For the DQF.COSY and 1H-31P correlation experiments we therefore diluted the sample threefold in the same buffer. Dilution greatly increases the sensitivity of these correlation experiments, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, without changing the NOESY spectrum, except for narrowing the lines and the loss of the 1GH1'-12CH6 cross-peak (which presumably arises from duplex association). Structural features Globally, a major feature of the duplex is the rather narrow minor groove in the [GGA]2 region, which gives the duplex a non-cylindrical flattened tape-like appearance when viewed from the side (see Figure 7); the shortest interstrand phosphorus° phosphorus distance is only ca. 8.5 A. At a more local level, the most unusual features of the duplex are the vertical stagger and stacking of the ``G·G pairs'' between the sheared G·A pairs in the two [GGA]2 motifs. The central guanines of the two juxtaposed GGA triplets effectively intercalate, without a base-pairing partner, producing a stack of four guanines (two from each strand) all of which have their N2H-N1H-O6-N7 hydrogen-bonding surface free and exposed to solvent.

The back-calculated NOESY spectrum for the final refined GGA-GGA duplex structure (bottom) alongside the experimental NOESY spectrum (top) in the H8/ H6 to H1'/H3' region at 120 ms mixing time. The peak in the bottom right region of the experimental spectrum indicated by the long arrow is the inter-duplex 12CH6 to 1GH1' cross-peak, which disappears on diluting the sample. The labels used correspond to those in Figure 2. Note the 4G, 9G intra-residue H8-H3' NOEs are stronger than in other residues, reflecting the C3'endo nature of these two unpaired nucleosides. The inter-residue 4GH8-3GH1' (c) and 9GH8-8GH1' (c') NOEs are unexpectedly strong, but are well-simulated by the final structure.

refined structure are listed in Table 3 and Table 4 respectively. We have previously presented the structure of a [GGA]2 motif determined by refining a starting [GIA]2 structure against the [GGA]2 NOESY data (Chou et al. 1994b). The present structure has been determined directly from [d(GTGGAATGGAAC)]2 NMR data and Figure 8 shows stereo views from various orientations of the [TGGAA]2 pentamer repeat unit of the human centromere. The view in Figure 8A is into the narrow minor groove and shows the cross-strand ``stacking'' of the propellertwisted A bases of the bracketing G·A pairs with the O4' ring oxygens (colored red) of the deoxyribose sugars of the unpaired guanosines G4 and G9'. Down the 2-fold axis through the center of Figure 8A, the proximity of the (yellow strand) G4H1' to the (blue strand) G9'H2" (and vice versa) is easily discerned, (see peaks c and c' in Figure 3). This closeness of two deoxyribose residues from opposite strands is a feature not seen in normal Watson-Crick duplexes. Although duplex stabilization via base-deoxyribose interactions is less common than stabilization by base-base stacking, it is not without precedent. In fact, it is a major stabilizing factor at the CpG step in Z-DNA (Wang et al., 1981), which has very little base-base stacking

overlap. Base-sugar stacking also occurs in the crystal structure of a self-intercalated dimer of cyclic d(ApAp) (Frederick et al., 1988) and in the crystal structures of DNA complexes with drugs (Teng et al., 1988; Kopka et al., 1985; Coll et al., 1987). The stabilizing force in such interactions has been discussed recently and is believed to arise from O4'-HC hydrogen bonding and an n : p* interaction (Egli & Gessner, 1995). Figure 8B shows a rotated view of one [TGGAA]2 repeat unit looking into the major groove in the bottom half and into the minor groove in the top half of the duplex. Down the right side, one can easily see the interstrand crossover stacking of the yellow strand (5')TGG on the blue strand (3')GGT to form a continuous six-base T2-G3-G4-G9'-G8'-T7' stack down this side of the duplex. Such cross-strand base stacking has also been shown to be an important factor in stabilizing duplexes containing adjacent G·A pairs in (PyGAPu)2 structures (Li et al., 1991; Chou et al., 1992b, 1994a). From top to bottom, the left side of the duplex consists of a blue (3')A11'-A10' dinucleotide step separated from the yellow (5')A5-A6 step by two gaps that are filled by the two deoxyribose rings of the unpaired G4 and G9' residues. In addition to the A-O4' base-sugar vertical stack shown in Figure 8A,

the gaps down the A-A-dRib-dRib-A-A side are also stabilized by N2H-O base­phosphate hydrogen bonding from the G4 amino group to the A10' phosphate (on the far side of the duplex) and from the G9' amino group (white) to the A5 phosphate (pink) on the near side of the duplex. It has been reported that centromere condensation may also reflect some form of base­backbone interaction (Timsit & Moras, 1991, 1994). Figure 9A and B show skeletal and space-filling representations of the duplex pentamer repeat unit viewed from the base-stacked T-G-G-G-G-T side. The four costacked guanine residues pointing towards the viewer in the center of the motif are plainly visible in the skeletal structure in Figure 9A. The space-filling structure in Figure 9B is viewed from the same orientation and clearly shows the tightly stacked four-guanine ``sticky patch'' present in the middle of each repeat unit. Because the top (G3) and bottom (G8') guanine residues are involved in sheared G·A pairing, all four guanine residues G3-G4-G9'-G8' have their N2H-N1H-O6-N7 face exposed to solvent, creating a 4 × 4 patch for hydrogen-bonding interactions to ligands that is repeated twice per turn on opposite sides of the duplex. At the top and bottom of Figures 8B, 9A and B, it can be seen how easily the [GGA]2 motif fits between flanking T·A and A·T Watson-Crick base-pairs. Figure 10 shows projection views down the helix axis of the nearest-neighbor stacking in the [TGGAA]2 pentamer repeat unit. Projection (A) shows the stacking of the peripheral Watson-Crick T·A pair on the sheared G·A pair, while (B) shows the excellent stacking of the 4G sugar O4' with the six-membered ring of the G·A adenine but the rather limited stacking overlap of the unpaired 4G base with the guanine of the G·A pair. The most unusual stacking pattern is shown in Figure 10(C), where the five- and six-membered rings of the unpaired 4G base stack almost exactly on top of the six- and five-membered rings of the unpaired 9'G base below. Much of the stability of this unusual motif is presumably derived from this perfectly overlapped stack.

a Parameters are calculated based on the values of all 12 final structures using the NEWHELIX91 program provided by R. E. Dickerson. b Considering the unusual structure feature of this sequence, which contains four unpaired guanosine residues, single-strand rotation and rise relative to global helical axis as measured by C1' are used. Bold represents the G-G step of the [GGA]2 motif; italic represents the G-A step of the [GGA]2 motif.

Discussion
It is well documented that purine-rich sequences tend to form unusual structures (Wells et al., 1988). Perhaps the best-known example is the tetraplex structure involving in-plane G-tetrads adopted by the (TTAGGG)n repeats of human telomeres. The complementary Watson-Crick (CCCTAA)n strand appears, at least at acidic pH, to form an intramolecular self-intercalated C+·C tetraplex (Gehring et al., 1993; Ahmed et al., 1994). We have previously studied purine-rich DNA sequences containing adjacent G·A pairs and found that they form stable duplexes, albeit in a sequence- and context-dependent manner. NAGN sequences do not form (AG)2 motifs and only NGAN sequences in PyGAPu contexts (but not in PuGAPy contexts) form stable duplexes with [GA]2 motifs containing adjacent sheared G·A mispairs (Cheng et al., 1992). It was therefore of interest to determine whether purine-rich centromere DNA sequences could also form duplexes with unusual pairing. This report, together with our previous data on [GIA]2 pairing (Chou et al., 1994b), clearly establishes the ability of GGA to pair with GGA in an antiparallel orientation to form a stable duplex containing unpaired staggered guanosine residues intercalated between sheared G·A pairs in an unusual new [GGA]2 motif in the purine-rich centromere DNA sequence. A similar [GAA]2 structure appears to exist with intercalated adenosine residues stacked between the sheared G·A pairs (see Figure 1), i.e. the motif is a generic [GPuA]2 one. Unlike the unusual BII-like (e = -50°, or g- ) GpA phosphodiesters in adjacent G·A pairs (Chou et al., 1992a,b), the GpA phosphodiesters in the [GGA]2 motif exhibit the normal BI (e(t), z(g- )) conformation (see Table 4). As a result, no downfield-shifted phosphorus resonances are observed in the 31P spectrum of [d(GTGGAATGGAAC)]2 (as shown in

Figure 5). In the [GGA]2 motif reported here, the insertion of two stacked unpaired guanosine residues between the two sheared G·A pairs involves rearranging the 4G-5A and 9G-10A steps to accommodate the intercalation of the oppositestrand guanosine. This stretching of the G-A step is accomplished by a large change in d as a result of the C2'-endo (S) to C3'-endo (N) change in the 4G deoxyribose, together with a combination of small changes in the a, b, g torsion angles of 5A (as well as in the x angles of 3G and 4G; see Table 4). The connecting backbone torsion angles a, b, g, e and z are all in the general g-, t, g+, t, g- domains respectively, with the exception of the guanosine residues of the sheared G·A pairs, which have z torsion angles closer to the trans domain combined with trans e angles (see Table 4). The d torsion angle is thus very important for accommodating the cross-strand intercalation. Similar situations have been found in the crystal structures of DNA fragments with bound intercalator drugs (Tsai et al., 1977; Wang et al., 1978) and in loop-loop interactions in tRNA folding (Rich et al., 1979). In the drug­DNA complexes, the sugar-phosphate chains were found to be sufficiently deformable to permit base­base ° separations of 6.8 A to accommodate the intercalation of planar drugs without having to alter the z(g- ) and a(g- ) phosphate torsion angles. However, the sugars on the 5'-side of the intercalation site were found to be in the C3-endo conformation, with all the other sugars remaining in the C2'-endo conformation. In the case of tRNA folding, the G57 base of the rT loop intercalates between the G19·C56 and G18·C55 base-pairs to form a continuous G19/G57/ G18/m1A58 stack. This stack is one of the most important stabilizing interactions in tRNA folding and, in an interesting analogy to the present case, the intercalated unpaired G57 retains its C3'-endo conformation while the G19, G18 and m1A58 residues adopt a C2'-endo conformation even in tRNA, in order to accommodate the G57 intercalation. It is not clear at the moment whether intercalation of unpaired bases from opposite strands occurs

only between two sheared G·A base-pairs, or whether other types of base-pairs can also accommodate such cross-strand intercalation. A molecular model for a [d(GGAAACC)]2 duplex has been proposed that involves cross-strand adenine intercalation (Viswamitra & Pandit, 1983) and a similar model with cross-strand base­base stacking has been used to rationalize interactions between non-complementary distal regions in the packaging of single-stranded Pf1 bacteriophage DNA (Marvin et al., 1992). We have found that the orientation of the bracketing G·A mispairs is important in stabilizing the [GGA]2 motif (Chou et al., 1994b). While the GGA:GGA sequence forms a stable antiparallel motif, the AGG:AGG sequence does not, indicating special stacking requirements for the formation of the intercalated duplex. It also remains to be seen how many unpaired purine residues can be intercalated between two sheared G·A pairs without breaking the duplex geometry. The reason this is of interest is that the functional yeast centromere sequence is (TGGAAA)n (Carbon & Clarke, 1990; Grady et al., 1992). Antiparallel pairing of this hexamer with itself would generate four guanosine residues, either stacked or paired, between the bracketing sheared G·A pairs. Although the purine-rich (TGGAA)n strand of human centromere DNA can form a [d(TGGAA)n ]2 duplex, whether or not it does so in vivo by separating from its complementary d(TTCCA)n strand remains unproven. However, the fact that d(TGGAA)n :d(TGGAA)n duplexes are at least as stable thermodynamically as the complementary d(TGGAA)n :d(TTCCA)n duplexes (Grady et al., 1992) argues for their formation and occurrence outside the NMR tube, without necessarily revealing their biological function. The presence of two [GGA]2 motifs per turn, each with four guanine residues that have not yet used their hydrogenbonding face, would create a long (possibly folded back) two-sided ``sticky'' DNA filament at the centromere, with intriguing possibilities in the capture of chromosomes during mitosis.

The 10'A-4GdRib and 5A-9'GdRib interactions are shown more clearly in A. At the top of the lower half facing the viewer, the interstrand base-phosphate hydrogen-bonding interaction between the unpaired 9'G N2H2 (white) and the phosphate of 5A (pink) can be plainly seen.

We note that related sequences with potentially similar self-pairing possibilities were discovered about 15 years ago and were proposed to play an important functional role in the replication of single-stranded DNA viruses (Astell et al., 1979, 1985). The 3'-terminal 115 residues of four single-stranded DNA parvoviruses were shown to be highly conserved and to fold back to form a Y-shaped hairpin structure within which DNA replication both originates and terminates. The stem of the Y hairpin contains an antiparallel 5'GAA:GA-3' ``bubble'' which did not display the expected endonuclease susceptibility (Astell et al., 1979). We surmise that this resistance may well reflect a GAA:GA duplex containing a single

intercalated adenine between two sheared G·A pairs, rather than a bubble. Preliminary NMR studies suggest that, as with the [GGA]2 motif, GAA:GA intercalation motifs can be incorporated between flanking Watson-Crick pairs to form stable duplexes (S.-H. Chou et al., unpublished results). In summary, we have established that the trinucleotide GGA (and also GAA), when flanked by Watson-Crick T·A/A·T pairs in tandem repeat (TGGAA)n pentamers, forms a novel type of DNA double helix containing two [GGA]2 motifs per turn of the duplex in which the two juxtaposed central guanine residues are costacked in an unpaired configuration. In contrast, the trinucleotide GCA does not form an analogous duplex containing

intercalated unpaired cytosines. Instead, it forms a rather stable hairpin loop or turn, closed by a sheared G·A pair with the cytosine in a singlenucleotide loop (Zhu et al., 1995a); this may or may not be related to the expansion of tandem GCA triplets in the recently discovered triplet-repeat diseases (Bates & Lehrach, 1994). While work is in progress in this direction, it is clear that much still needs to be done on the structure of polymorphic GNA motifs to clarify their functional role.

incrementation, 96 scans were averaged with a relaxation delay of 1.5 seconds. NOESY experiments in 2H2 O were also carried out on the home-built 500 MHz spectrometer at 25°C. Spectra were collected in the hypercomplex mode with a spectral width of 4386 Hz. Four mixing times of 60, 90, 120 and 240 ms were used with a relaxation delay of 2.4 s between transients and all spectra were collected during a single 4-day period without removing the sample from the probe; 2048 complex points in t2 and 400 complex points in t1 were collected. For each t1 incrementation, 32 scans were averaged. A DQF.COSY spectrum was collected on an AM-500 Bruker NMR spectrometer in the TPPI mode with a spectral width of 4386 Hz in both dimensions; 2048 complex points in the t2 dimension and 800 (real) points in the t1 dimension were collected with a relaxation delay of two seconds, and 32 scans were averaged for each t1 incrementation. To increase the sensitivity of the DQF.COSY experiment, the sample was diluted threefold in the same buffer. Dilution did not change the NOESY connectivity pattern but the linewidths were narrower and the end-to-end interactions disappeared after dilution. A proton-detected 31P-1H heteronuclear correlation spectrum (Sklenar et al., 1986) was collected on an AM-500 Bruker NMR spectrometer in the hypercomplex mode with a spectral width of 4386 Hz in the 1H dimension and a spectral width of 1529 Hz in the 31P dimension; 2048 complex points in the t2 ( 1H) dimension, and 100 complex points in the t1 ( 31P) dimension, were collected. Protons were presaturated for 1.0 second and 256 scans were used for each t1 incrementation. The sample concentration was the same as that for the DQF.COSY experiment. The acquired data were transferred to an IRIS 4D workstation and processed with FTNMR and/or FELIX software (Hare Res., Inc., Woodinville, WA). Structural calculations Since qualitative evaluation of the unexpected types of observed NOEs indicated that the structure was destined to be markedly different from any known duplex, no reasonably close starting structure for energy minimization or molecular dynamics refinement was available. Hence we used Distance Geometry (DG) methods to determine an initial solution structure. The initial NOE build-up rates were converted to distances which were entered into a bounds matrix that was smoothed using the triangle inequality relationship. Several structures were then randomly embedded in 3-space from the bounds matrix and subsequently refined against the distance bounds as described previously (Hare & Reid, 1986). The structure was then further refined in the AMBER force field by Restrained Molecular Mechanics/Dynamics (using the DISCOVER program; Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). After back-calculating the NOESY spectra using the simulation program BIRDER (Zhu & Reid, 1995), and then comparing them with the experimental data, a modified bounds file is produced. This process was repeated until the simulated NOESY spectra match the experimental spectra with a satisfactory R-factor that does not improve with further iterations. The resulting structures were finally checked for torsion angle consistency by qualitative analysis of the observed coupling constants; quantitative use of the J-coupling data was avoided because the relationship between the torsion angle and the coupling constant has

been shown to be complicated by transverse cross-relaxation in the spin-diffusion limit (Harbison, 1993; Zhu et al. 1994, 1995b).
