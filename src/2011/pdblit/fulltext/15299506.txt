Abstract

In an earlier study [Heinemann & Hahn (1992). J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7332-7341], the crystal structure of the double-stranded B-DNA decamer d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) was refined with NUCLSQ to R = 17.4% against 3799 20- structure amplitudes in the resolution range 8-1.7 A. This structure has now been re-refined against the same diffraction data using either TNT or X-PLOR in order to determine to what extent the resulting DNA conformations would differ and to examine the suitability of these programs for the refinement of oligonucleotide structures. The R value from the NUCLSQ refinement could not be reached with either TNT or X-PLOR, although both programs yield reasonably refined DNA models showing root-mean-square deviations against the NUCLSQ model of the decamer duplex of 0.25 and 0.32 A, respectively. Some derived local structure parameters differ depending on the refinement procedure used. This holds true for several exocyclic torsion angles of the sugarphosphate backbone, whereas sugar puckers as well as helical and base-pair stacking parameters are only weakly influenced. A subset of 15 solvent sites with low temperature factors is conserved in all three models.
Introduction

In the resolution range normally accessible, the crystal structure of a biological macromolecule is not determined by the measured X-ray diffraction data alone. Instead, structure refinement needs to be supplemented with stereochemical constraints or restraints (Jensen, 1985). Refinement packages use different approaches to ensure acceptable geometry, hence the results obtained with them may differ too. This is a problem especially with nucleic acid structures, where the global structure is usually predefined in one of the helical families and sequencedetermined fine structural details are of interest. In earlier studies, the structure of the B-DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG), first published * Author for correspondence. © 1993 International Union of Crystallograpt"' Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved

by Dickerson and colleagues (Wing et al., 1980; Dickerson & Drew, 1981), was re-refined by different approaches. The original structure had been refined with the program of Jack & Levitt (1978), and the re-refinements used a version of CORELS (Sussman, Holbrook, Church & Kim, 1977) and NUCLIN/ NUCLSQ (Westhof, Dumas & Moras, 1985). Refinement with CORELS using anisotropic temperature factors for rigid groups provided an improved fit of the model to the experimental data as judged from the R value and from the difference electron density (Holbrook, Dickerson & Kim, 1985). Refinement of the DNA model with NUCLSQ, on the other hand, showed that the overall structure was insensitive to the refinement algorithm applied whereas the backbone torsion angles showed some differences (Westhof, 1987). NUCLSQ is well established for the refinement of nucleic acid crystal structures (Shakked & Rabinovich, 1986; Kennard & Hunter, 1989) but is not easily applicable to the structure determination of DNA in protein-DNA complexes. Although Jordan & Pabo (1988) and Suck, Lahm & Oefner (1988) have modified the Hendrickson-Konnert conjugate-gradient program (Hendrickson, 1985) to accept restraints for nucleic acids based on a version of NUCLIN, usually programs like TNT (Tronrud, Ten Eyck & Matthews, 1987) or X-PLOR (Br/inger, Kuriyan & Karplus, 1987) have been used for the refinement of protein-DNA complexes (Schultz, Shields & Steitz, 1991; Somers & Philipps, 1992; Pavletich & Pabo, 1991; Beamer & Pabo, 1992). The aim of the present study is to investigate the suitability of TNT and X-PLOR for DNA structure refinement and to test their effect on the derived stereochemical parameters. Both programs provide their own standard geometry files for nucleic acids. X-PLOR has been used before in the refinement of DNA crystal structures (Yoon, Priv6, Goodsell & Dickerson, 1988; Courseille et al., 1990). The double-stranded DNA decamer d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) has been refined with NUCLIN/ NUCLSQ to an R value of 17.4% against 1.7,~ X-ray diffraction data (Heinemann & Hahn, 1992). Here we describe the re-refinement of this structure

In all cases, the starting model for the refinement was the structure of d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) refined to 2.25 A (Heinemann & Alings, 1991). All solvent molecules were deleted from the model, and temperature factors were reset to 19.1 A 2, the overall B value obtained from Wilson (1942) statistics. The structure refined with NUCLSQ against the present 1.7 A data set consisting of 3799 20 structure amplitudes was published elsewhere (Heinemann & Hahn, 1992) and is not described here therefore. It should be mentioned that bond lengths, bond angles, planes, chiral centers and non-bonded contacts were restrained, whereas torsion angles remained unrestrained in this refinement. The restraints applied to stereochemical parameters in T N T and their weights are shown in Tables 1 and 2 for a number of cycles. The target distances for non-bonded contacts were those from NUCLIN, since the values provided by T N T led to contacts that were judged unacceptably close. Torsion angles were not restrained, thermal parameters were restrained with the BCORREL module of TNT. In total, 17 rounds of T N T refinement were performed with 20 least-squares cycles each. Water molecules were added to the set after round 5, and the 2o cutoff was applied on the structure amplitudes after round 10. Finally, 37 water O atoms, all with full occupancy and reasonable temperature factors, were located, and the refinement converged at R = 20.6%. X-PLOR uses a simulated-annealing (SA) procedure (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt & Vecchi, 1983) to explore the conformational space of the molecule by molecular dynamics. It provides a large radius of convergence compared to conventional least-squares refinement and therefore reduces the need for manual corrections (Brfinger, Kuriyan & Karplus, 1987). The coordinates of d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) were prepared for X-PLOR by addition of polar H atoms, based on parameter and topology files originally from CHA R M M (Brooks et al., 1983). The weight for the X-ray pseudo-energy term was determined before each run with the CHECK module of X-PLOR. Simulated annealing was performed with the slow-cooling protocol (Brfinger, Krukowski & Erickson, 1990) starting at an initial temperature of 3000 K and descending in steps of 25

to 300 K. The resulting model was then refined by conjugate-gradient methods, with 120 steps for coordinates and 20 steps for temperature factors in each cycle. This yielded an R value of 27.9% with 20structure amplitudes from 20 to 1.7/k. In the next cycles, solvent molecules were added, and the structure was further refined by the conjugate-gradient method after setting the low-resolution cutoff to 8 A. After 18 cycles and addition of 80 water O atoms the refinement converged with R = 19.1%. The course of the X-PLOR refinement is summarized in Table 3.

In all three refinement schemes, electron-density maps were displayed with the graphics program FRODO (Jones, 1985). The peaks of difference Fourier maps were accepted as water O atoms if they had hydrogen-bonding distances to polar D N A atoms in the range of 2.4-3.5 A. A small number of water molecules that violated the upper threshold were added to the coordinate sets to satisfy persistent difference electron density and retained if they refined to acceptable B values of less than 50 A 2. The structure-factor amplitudes of d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) and the atomic coordinates of the NUCLSQ-derived model are available from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank as entries R2D25SF and 2D25, respectively.

Refinement results
The D N A stereochemistry and the agreement of the atomic model with the X-ray observations after structure refinement with NUCLSQ, TNT and X-PLOR are summarized in Table 4. The root-meansquare (r.m.s.) deviations for various parameters are shown with respect to the target values of the NUCLIN stereochemical library. Thus, they are likely to be larger for the TNT- and X-PLORderived models, since the standard geometries used in these programs are slightly different. However, since Table 4 is based on the same reference geometry, it permits a direct comparison to be made. Analyses based on the TNT and X-PLOR libraries (not shown) give smaller r.m.s, differences for the models resulting from these programs, but the trends apparent from Table 4 are observed as well. The standard geometries defined in the NUCLIN, TNT and X-PLOR (PARAM11.DNA) libraries are appreciably different. Ideal bond lengths in sugars and bases, for example, show r.m.s, differences of 0.014A for the TNT library and of 0.015,~, for P A R A M l l . D N A when compared to the NUCLIN standard geometry. This accounts for the differences in the corresponding values of Table 4. Engh & Huber (1991) after noticing similar discrepancies in bond-length and bond-angle values for proteins have proposed a set of target distances and angles for refinement with X-PLOR.

Whereas X-PLOR shows the largest deviations from base planarity in the models for d(CCAGGCmSCTGG), it gives the smallest violations of non-bonded contact distances. For singletorsion distances, this is partly as a result of torsionangle restraints which were not used with NUCLSQ or TNT. All three refinement schemes produce similar variations of thermal parameters. NUCLSQ gives the best model fit to the diffraction data as judged from the R value, the mean IFo- Fcl, the correlation coefficient and the final difference-density map. The higher R value and the noisier difference density given by the TNT-refined model is mainly as a result of the presence of only 37 water O atoms in the coordinate set which, in turn, is a consequence of the refinement of B values with TNT (see below). The R values of the final DNA models, omitting the solvent, are identical to within 1.4% after refinement with NUCLSQ, TNT or X-PLOR. Thus, judged by this criterion and by the close similarity of the resulting structures (see below), all three programs can provide reasonable DNA structures. Fig. 1 shows electron densities around the base pair A(3).T(18) for a visual comparison of the model fit to the X-ray data. The simulated-annealing procedure of X-PLOR reduces the R value of the input model rapidly (see Table 3), but subsequent conventional least-squares refinement with this program does not give as good a fit to the data as NUCLSQ. Therefore, as a test the

X-PLOR-derived model was further refined with 135 cycles of N U C L S Q . After removal of three water molecules which adopted high B values from the coordinate set, the R value converged at 17.7%, the difference density was clean with a maximum of 0.26 e A -3 and the N U C L S Q model geometry was very similar to that shown in Table 4. lntermolecular contacts

In both T N T and X - P L O R , intermolecular nonbonded contacts are restrained, whereas in N U C L S Q they are not. Nevertheless, lattice contacts between duplex D N A molecules, either direct or via a bridging water molecule, are at least partially conserved. Four direct hydrogen-bonded contacts are observed in both the N U C L S Q - and TNT-derived models of which three are identical. Only one of these contacts is also present in the X - P L O R model. Seven bridging water molecules making hydrogen bonds to two duplex molecules in the crystal are conserved in all three models, out of a total of 15 from N U C L S Q . Thus, the conservation of bridging water molecules is significantly better than for solvent sites in general (see below). Restraints on intermolecular non-bonded contacts do not have a strong influence on the lattice contacts.

Least-squares superposition (Fig. 2) shows the global structures of d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) resulting from refinement with N U C L S Q , T N T or X - P L O R to be very similar. The r.m.s, distances between equivalent atoms (Table 5) are close to the average coordinate error calculated to be 0.2-0.3 A by the method of Luzzati (1952). If the superposition is limited to the inner eight base pairs of the duplexes, the r.m.s. deviations are further reduced. Therefore, the global structures of the D N A decamer are identical within the accuracy of the structure determination no matter which program is used for refinement. The r.m.s, deviations between the final models and the starting structure are between 0.42 A (X-PLOR) and 0.29 A (TNT).

d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) propeller, since, in the former, the geometry of the Watson-Crick base pairs is explicitly restrained whereas in the latter it is not. It appears, however, that this does not play a major role, since both the mean values and the sequence-dependent variations of propeller are similar in all three models.

All three models show the same degree of asymmetry which is characterized by r.m.s, deviations of 0.5--0.6 A between the superimposed atoms of the chemically identical single strands. This asymmetry is clearly above the experimental error and must be attributed to crystal packing. A superposition of the models of d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) with the structure of the unmethylated variant, d(CCAGGCCTGG) (Heinemann & Alings, 1989), gives r.m.s, deviations around 1.05 A. Despite this difference, the decamer helices in general show similar structural features.

Torsion angles and sugar pucker
Torsion angles are determined by only four atoms, whereas the helical parameters discussed above are defined by larger subsets of atoms. We may expect, therefore, a more notable influence of the small coordinate differences between the helical models of d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) on the torsion angles. Fig. 4 shows that this is indeed the case. In all three models, the mean values of the backbone torsion angles fall in the expected ranges of, for example, (_)gauche for re, trans for fl and (+)gauche for y. The distributions of torsion angles and pseudorotation phase angles, however, are quite different between the NUCLSQ, TNT and X-PLOR refined structures (inner, middle and outer ring, respectively). NUCLSQ tends to yield the narrowest angular range, although in refinement with this program explicit torsion-angle restraints were not applied. Apparently, the chiral-volume restraints for sugar atoms employed in NUCLSQ are very efficient in maintaining reasonable torsion-angle values. The well known correlations between torsion angles in the sugar-phosphate backbone, e.g. a/y, 6/X, e/~, (Dickerson et al., 1982; Dickerson, Kopka & Drew, 1983) are well preserved in all three models (not shown).

Helical parameters
After having established the close general similarity of the D N A model resulting from the different refinement schemes it has to be discussed to what extent the remaining small structural differences influence derived conformational parameters. The most important helical parameters for the three models of d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) have been calculated with NEWHEL91 (Dickerson, 1991) and are displayed in Fig. 3. It is apparent from the plots and the linear correlation coefficients between parameters, which are 0.74 or above, that the helical parameters are only slightly affected by the refinement procedure employed. The parameters twist, rise and slide are remarkably similar between the different D N A models (correlation coefficients 0.94 or above), whereas the agreement is poorest for roll between the NUCLSQ and TNT models. A significant difference between the NUCLSQ structures on one side and the TNT or X-PLOR models on the other might be expected for the

MICHAEL HAHN AND UDO HEINEMANN The values for e - s usually show a bimodal distrir bution which defines the B, ( e - ( < 0 °) versus B[l ( e - ( > 0 °) backbone types (Priv6 et al., 1987). In the three D N A models discussed here, a clear bimodal distribution is seen exclusively for s but not for e. r Hence, the less pronounced bimodal distribution of e - ~" is entirely because of the ( torsion angle which should, therefore, be used to define the backbone type instead of e - s r. The sequence-dependent variation of torsion angles along the backbones in the three D N A models

is best compared by calculating linear correlation coefficients (Table 6). It is obvious that sugar pucker and the glycosidic torsion g are fairly well preserved in the three models, whereas the exocyclic torsion angles a, fl and 3' are less well defined. Thus, even at a resolution of 1.7 A, the variation of these torsion angles within their expected ranges remains mostly an artefact of structure refinement. The situation is different with the remaining exocyclic torsion angles e and ~" which vary over a wider range along the strands. Their sequence-dependent change is very

Thermal parameters
In all three refinement schemes, thermal parameters were restrained to prevent unreasonably large B-factor differences in atoms linked by one or two covalent bonds. The mean B values for the atoms in bases, sugars and phosphate groups of d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) after refinement with NUCLSQ, TNT and X-PLOR are shown in Fig. 5. There is a significant increase of temperature factors in the TNT-derived model as compared to the two other models. The average B value expected from Wilson (1942) statistics of 19.1 A 2 is close to the average B's of 22.2 and 21.4 A 2 of the DNA atoms in the NUCLSQ and X-PLOR models, respectively. The elevated level of temperature factor encountered in the TNT refinement ((B)= 28.0A? for DNA atoms) poses a problem in the location of solvent molecules many of which refine to very large B

attention (Saenger, Hunter & Kennard, 1986; Westhof, 1988; Kennard et al., 1986; Kopka, Fratini, Drew & Dickerson, 1983). For analyses it is mandatory to know the reliability with which solvent sites are determined in D N A crystal structures. By comparing the solvent structure in the three decamer models arising from refinement with NUCLSQ, T N T and X-PLOR we have tried to define those solvent sites that are conserved, i.e. not influenced by refinement protocol or operator bias. Solvent sites (water O atoms) were considered conserved when they appeared within a specified cut-off distance from one another in both the N U C L S Q model and either the T N T or the X-PLOR models a~d shared at least one hydrogen-bond partner. From histograms of the frequency of occurrence in pairwise comparisons versus the water-water distance (not shown) the cut-off distance was chosen to be 0.8 A. Following this definition, 23 solvent sites are conserved between the N U C L S Q and T N T models and 26 in the N U C L S Q / X - P L O R pair. Looking at all three models, we find only 15 conserved solvent sites (Fig. 6). This is a surprisingly small number in comparison with the total number of more than 80 sites resulting from refinement with both N U C L S Q and X-PLOR. The conclusion has to be that most of the remaining solvent sites are determined with questionable reliability. Of the 15 conserved water molecules, three are in the minor groove, five in the major groove, six are hydrogen bonded to phosphate O atoms and one belongs to the secondary hydration shell. Regular patterns of

d(CCAGGCmSCTGG) sis, cations could not be located unambiguously. A partly hydrated Mg 2÷ was assigned in the N U C L S Q model (Heinemann & Hahn, 1992) which was not confirmed in the T N T and X - P L O R refinements where solvent spheres could be modelled with water O atoms exclusively. We have shown that D N A models after T N T or X - P L O R refinement are not systematically different from those resulting from N U C L S Q . For this reason, the conformation of D N A in complexes with proteins, usually refined with the former programs, may be directly compared with oligonucleotide crystal structures, usually refined with the latter. Proteinnucleic acid crystal structures will normally be refined with T N T or X - P L O R alone, whereas for structure analyses of free nucleic acid fragments is it still advantageous to use N U C L S Q in the final refinement cycles in order to find the optimum model fit to the diffraction data. Advice on the use of T N T by Dr D. E. Tronrud (University of Oregon, Eugene), helpful discussions with H. Schindelin and Drs J. Granzin and W. Hinrichs, and continued support by Professor W. Saenger are gratefully acknowledged. This research was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through SFB 344, Teilprojekt D/3, and by the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie.

hydration are hardly discernible in the small set of 15 conserved sites. As expected, the average temperature factors of the conserved water molecules are smaller, with 27, 33 and 29 A 2 in the N U C L S Q , T N T and X - P L O R models, than those for the entire solvent spheres which are between 38 and 40 A 2 in all three models. The absence of conserved water molecules bound to the outer four base pairs may be explained by the elevated B values of D N A atoms near the ends of the duplex.
Discussion

Using X-ray diffraction data at 1.7 A resolution, the crystal structure of the B-DNA decamer d(CCAGGCm5CTGG) has been refined with three different protocols. The D N A conformations obtained after refinement with N U C L S Q , T N T and X - P L O R are nearly identical within the limits of the attainable accuracy. Nevertheless, the small differences in D N A coordinates affect, in different ways, derived conformational parameters routinely used to describe D N A structures. Global D N A structure, groove dimensions and helical parameters describing the geometry of base pairs, their orientation and position relative to the helix axis, and the geometry of base-pair stacking are preserved very well in the models obtained by the different refinement schemes. Thus, given diffraction data of reasonable quality, X-ray crystallography can provide a reliable description of D N A conformation in these terms. The situation is slightly different regarding the conformation of the sugar-phosphate backbone. Here, the deoxyribose pucker, the glycosidic torsion angles and the B~ versus BH backbone type from nucleotide to nucleotide are determined reproducibly whereas the seemingly sequencedependent variation of the exocyclic torsion angles a, fl and y within their standard ranges appears not to be meaningful at the resolution of this analysis. The solvent sphere around the D N A molecule is surprisingly poorly determined. Only 15 water molecules were located at equivalent sites in the three models of d(CCAGGCmSCTGG). Out of these 15 only three are hydrogen bonded to minor-groove atoms. Since the minor groove of B-DNA is expected to display an ordered hydration pattern (Priv6 et al., 1987; Chuprina et al., 1991), we have to ask why it is so ill defined in the present analysis. The reason may rest in an unusual combination of sequence and groove dimensions. For the most part, the minor groove is too narrow to permit a double string of water molecules running down its walls, whereas a spine of hydration at the bottom of the groove is disturbed by the presence of the guanine amino functions in eight out of the ten base pairs of the decamer duplex. At the 1.7/~ resolution of the analy-
