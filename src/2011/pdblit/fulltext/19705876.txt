Ferritins solubilize and detoxify the essential metal iron through formation of a ferric mineral within the protein's central cavity. Key to this activity is an intrasubunit catalytic dinuclear iron center called the ferroxidase center. Here we show that the fluorescence intensity of Escherichia coli bacterioferritin (BFR), due to the presence of two tryptophan residues (Trp35 and Trp133) in each of the 24 subunits, is highly sensitive to the iron status of the ferroxidase center and is quenched to different extents by Fe2þ and Fe3þ. Recovery of the quench following oxidation of Fe2þ to Fe3þ at the ferroxidase center was not observed, indicating that the di-Fe3þ form of the center is stable. Studies of the single-tryptophan variants W35F and ° W133F showed that Trp133, which lies 10 A from the ferroxidase center, is primarily responsible for the observed fluorescence sensitivity to iron, while studies of a stable E. coli BFR subunit dimer demonstrated that the observed quench properties are principally derived from the interaction of iron with tryptophan residues within the subunit dimer. A double-tryptophan variant (W35F/W133F) was found to exhibit fluorescence from the seven tyrosine residues present in each subunit, which was also sensitive to the iron status of the ferroxidase center. Finally, we demonstrate using Zn2þ, a potent competitive inhibitor of Fe2þ binding and oxidation, that the fluorescence response can be used to monitor the loss of iron from the ferroxidase center.

ABSTRACT:

Bacterioferritin (BFR) from Escherichia coli is a member of the widespread ferritin family of proteins that function in iron storage and detoxification (1-3). It consists of 24 identical subunits (Mw  18.5 kDa for each) that are packed together to form an approximately spherical molecule with a central cavity, in which large amounts of iron can be deposited as a ferric-oxy-hydroxide-phosphate mineral core. In addition to the iron core, BFR contains up to 12 b-type heme groups, which are situated between symmetry-related subunit pairs, bound by two methionine residues (Met52 and Met520 ) (4), and a catalytic dinuclear iron site within each subunit, known as the ferroxidase center. The two iron ions are bridged by two carboxylates, and each has monodentate carboxylate and histidine ligands (5) (see Figure 1). The ferroxidase center plays a key role in mineralization (6, 7), which proceeds through the binding of Fe2þ ions at the vacant ferroxidase centers (phase 1), the rapid reaction with oxygen (or hydrogen peroxide) to generate a bridged di-Fe3þ center and reduced oxygen species (phase 2) (6-8), and slow core formation (phase 3). In related mammalian ferritins, the ferroxidase center also plays a key role in mineralization, but it is not absolutely required for this process; in the absence of a functional center, core nucleation can still occur, albeit very slowly, but once a

sufficiently large core surface has formed, surface-catalyzed oxidation can occur and core formation rates recover to near wild-type levels (9). BFR has quite different mechanistic features compared to eukaryotic ferritins; its ferroxidase center is active and absolutely required throughout core formation (10), indicating that the core surface alone cannot sustain significant rates of Fe2þ oxidation. Recently, high-resolution structures of apo, di-Fe2þ, and bridged di-Fe3þ forms of the E. coli BFR ferroxidase center have been determined, and a functionally important Fe2þ-binding site has been identified on the inner surface of the BFR cavity, ligated only by His46 and Asp50 (5). The available data support a model of mineralization in which the ferroxidase center continually cycles between ferrous and ferric forms, leading to oxygen reduction, with the electrons required to reduce the Fe3þ at the center coming from Fe2þ bound to the core surface (5, 10). Tryptophan fluorescence emission of H- and L-chain mammalian ferritins has previously been shown to be sensitive to the iron status of the protein and, in particular, to that of the ferroxidase centers (of homopolymer H-chain ferritin and of horse spleen ferritin, which typically contains 10-15% H-chain subunits) (11). Mammalian ferritin subunits contain a single ° tryptophan residue, which, in H-chain ferritins, is located 12 A from the ferroxidase center. E. coli BFR contains two tryptophan residues per subunit, Trp35 and Trp133, the latter of which is ° located within 10 A of the ferroxidase center (see Figure 1). Therefore, it was of great interest to determine whether the fluorescence properties of BFR could be exploited as a

mechanistic probe of Fe2þ binding and oxidation, particularly as fluorescence offers the potential to measure processes that cannot be followed by absorbance spectroscopy. Here, we report studies of the fluorescence properties of wild-type BFR and those of single- and double-tryptophan variants, and their responses to Fe2þ binding and oxidation. We demonstrate that fluorescence spectroscopy provides a sensitive method of monitoring Fe2þ binding and oxidation events in BFR, as the tryptophan fluorescence of the protein is highly sensitive to the presence and oxidation state of iron at the ferroxidase center and therefore offers a precise spectroscopic probe of the mechanism of iron incorporation. Oxidation of Fe2þ at the ferroxidase center was found to be the major cause of fluorescence quenching. Fluorescence intensity did not recover following Fe2þ oxidation, indicating clearly that Fe3þ remained at the ferroxidase center. Recovery of fluorescence intensity was observed, however, upon addition of Zn2þ, a well-known inhibitor of ferroxidase activity that binds tightly and specifically at the ferroxidase center. The data support a recently proposed mechanism for iron core mineralization in BFR in which the ferroxidase center cycles between di-Fe2þ and bridged di-Fe3þ forms, thereby acting as a true catalytic center, rather than as a pore for the conduit of Fe3þ ions into the BFR central cavity. Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy is revealed to be a highly sensitive and selective probe of the iron status of the ferroxidase center and therefore offers new insight into the role of the ferroxidase center in the mechanism of mineralization in BFR. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Strains, Growth Media, and Site-Directed Mutagenesis. E. coli strains JM109 and BL21(DE3)pLysS (Promega) were used for site-directed mutagenesis and expression, respectively,

and grown at 37 °C in LB1 (Luria-Bertani) broth, on LA plates consisting of LB broth with 1.25% (w/v) agar or in M9 minimal medium. Ampicillin, where appropriate, was used at a concentration of 100 mg/L. Molecular genetics techniques were used as previously described (12). Plasmid DNA was isolated using commercial mini- or midiprep kits (Qiagen). Enzymes for DNA manipulation were purchased from Roche or Promega. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using a whole-plasmid method (13). For the generation of constructs producing W35F and W133F BFR, primers CGAATTTAAAAACTTTGGTCTCAAACGTC and GGCCATATCGACTTTCTGGAAACGGAAC and their respective reverse complements were used with pGS578 as a template, giving pTLN1 and pTLN2, respectively. For W35F/W133F BFR, the W35F primer was used with pTLN2, generating pTLN5. The NdeI-EcoRI fragment of each was cloned into pET21a giving pTLN3 (W35F), pTLN4 (W133F), and pTLN6 (W35F/W133F), each of which was confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech). Protein Purification and Removal of Non-Heme Iron. Wild-type and tryptophan variants of BFR were purified, and non-heme iron was removed as previously described (10, 14). Heme contents of non-heme iron-free proteins, determined through the heme Soret absorbance intensity, using an 418 of 107000 M-1 cm-1, were found to be 1 per 24mer for the wild type and 1.5 per 24mer for W35F, W133F, and W35F/W133F BFRs, respectively. Concentrations of wild-type and tryptophan variants of BFR were calculated using the following per subunit 280 values: 33000 M-1 cm-1 [wild type (8)], 22300 M-1 cm-1

(W35F), 23375 M-1 cm-1 [W133F (5)], 18665 M-1 cm-1 (W35F/ W133F), determined by amino acid analyses (Alta Bioscience). The E. coli BFR subunit dimer was prepared as previously described (15), and its concentration was determined using a per subunit 280 value of 33000 M-1 cm-1 (8). Spectroscopic Methods. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer at 25 °C with excitation at 290 nm (for tryptophan excitation) or 276 nm (for tyrosine excitation). Excitation and emission slit widths were varied depending on the emission intensity of the sample. Metal ion additions were made using a microsyringe (Hamilton). For anaerobic experiments, additions were made in an anaerobic glovebox (Faircrest Engineering) in which the oxygen concentration was <2 ppm. For aerobic experiments, air-saturated solutions were employed, in which the concentration of oxygen was far in excess of that of iron. For experiments in which oxygen was introduced into a previously anaerobic sample, this was achieved by repeated aspiration of the sample, using a pipettor, under aerobic conditions. Titration experiments were conducted using a sample cuvette only, and after each Fe2þ addition, samples were incubated for 5 min before spectra were recorded. Data were corrected for dilution effects and plotted as either absolute intensity (arbitrary units) or as fractional intensity [(It - If)/ (Ii - If), where It is the intensity at point t in the titration and Ii and If are the initial and final intensity values, respectively]. Kinetic Methods. Kinetic measurements of changes in absorption at 340 nm after the addition of Fe2þ (as ferrous ammonium sulfate) to wild-type apo-BFR and apo-BFR variants were made using either a conventional UV-visible spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer 35 or 800 spectrophotometer), for which additions to the sample were made using a microsyringe (Hamilton), or by using a stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics DX17MV) with the BFR solution in one syringe and the metal ion solution in another. Structural Methods. Prior to crystallization, W35F and W133F BFR proteins were pretreated aerobically with

Fe(II)(NH4)2(SO4)2 to a level of 48 Fe2þ ions per 24mer protein, concentrated to 10 mg/mL in 20 mM Mes (pH 6.5), and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min to remove particulate matter. Crystals were obtained using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C. Sitting drops (2 L) were formed from equal volumes of the protein solution and crystallization reagent and equilibrated over an 800 L volume of the reagent alone. The crystallization reagent consisted of 1.8 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M trisodium citrate (pH 5.0). Crystals were cryoprotected and frozen in a solution of 1.65 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Mops (pH 7.0), and 25% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the UK Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), station 10.1. The structures of W35F and W133F BFR were determined by molecular replacement using the recently reported apo-BFR structure [PDB entry 3E1J (5)] as a starting point for refinement. Structural figures were produced using PYMOL (16) and annotated with GIMP. Coordinates and associated structure factor amplitudes (including anomalous data) were deposited in the RCSB PDB as entries 3GHQ (W35F) and 3E1Q (W133F). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Fe2þ Binding and Fe2þ Oxidation Quench the Tryptophan Fluorescence of BFR to Different Extents. Wild-type BFR lacking non-heme iron (apo-BFR) exhibited an intense fluorescence emission band at 353 nm due to the two tryptophan residues in each of its 24 subunits. To investigate the effect of iron on the fluorescence properties of the protein, apo-BFR was titrated with Fe2þ ions under aerobic conditions (see Figure 2A), which resulted in a quenching of the fluorescence emission intensity. Recent structural studies of E. coli BFR in iron-free (apo) and Fe2þ- and Fe3þ-bound forms revealed very few structural changes upon Fe2þ binding or oxidation, leading to the conclusion that the ferroxidase center, in its apo form, is preformed, ready to accept incoming Fe2þ ions (5). Therefore, the effect on the fluorescence intensity results simply from the binding of an efficient fluorescence quenching agent close to the

protein fluorophore(s). In contrast to a similar titration measured by UV-visible absorbance at 340 nm (7), in which Fe2þ oxidation is monitored directly through charge transfer bands due to O2-/OH--coordinated Fe3þ, a plot of intensity as a function of Fe2þ was not linear (up to 48 Fe2þ ions per protein). Instead, the plot (inset, Figure 2A) was curved, although saturation was still observed at 50 Fe2þ ions per BFR (2 Fe2þ ions per BFR subunit), at which point the emission intensity was reduced to 20% of its original value. A curved rather than linear response was observed most likely because Fe2þ binding or oxidation causes quenching of fluorescence intensity in neighboring subunits. Thus, Fe2þ binding or oxidation in the latter part of the titration would not cause the same degree of quenching as the initial binding or oxidation of Fe2þ (because intensity has already been significantly quenched by earlier additions). Once it had been established that fluorescence intensity is sensitive to iron, it was important to determine the relative contributions of Fe2þ and Fe3þ. To do this, apo-BFR was titrated in a fashion similar to that described above but under anaerobic conditions so that experiments in which Fe2þ binding and oxidation (to Fe3þ) occurred could be compared with those in which Fe2þ binding but not oxidation occurred. First, the anaerobic fluorescence emission spectrum of apo-BFR established that molecular oxygen alone did not cause a quenching of intensity (not shown). Following the addition of Fe2þ, however, quenching was observed (see Figure 2B). The plot of intensity as a function of Fe2þ added (inset, Figure 2B) was very different from that under aerobic conditions (compare to Figure 2A), indicating that both Fe2þ binding and Fe2þ oxidation cause quenching. A similar conclusion was drawn from studies of mammalian Hchain ferritin (11). The anaerobic Fe2þ plot was also curved [but less so than the aerobic plot (see Figure 2C, in which fractional intensity changes are plotted)], with saturation observed at 45 Fe2þ ions per BFR, at which point 65-70% of the original intensity remained.2 This indicated that although both the binding of Fe2þ and its subsequent oxidation are both significant contributors to the observed quench, the oxidation step is the major one. To further investigate the distinct effects of Fe2þ binding and oxidation on the tryptophan fluorescence intensity, 50 Fe2þ ions were added to apo-BFR under anaerobic conditions and the intensity at 353 nm was followed as a function of time (see Figure 2D). Oxygen was subsequently introduced and the effect on the 353 nm intensity followed. These data clearly resolved the anaerobic and aerobic contributions for a single sample and confirmed that the presence of Fe3þ ions at the ferroxidase center is the major contributor to quenching of the fluorescence. Furthermore, we note that following the introduction of oxygen and associated oxidation of Fe2þ to Fe3þ there was no further change in fluorescence, indicating that Fe3þ remains at the ferroxidase center, such that the bridged di-Fe3þ form of the center is stable, consistent with previous mechanistic and structural studies (5, 8).
2 Although the anaerobic plot appears to represent a binding isotherm, from which a dissociation constant might be obtainable, attempts to fit the data to a simple binding process indicated a Kd value in the nanomolar range, with a stoichiometry of 35 Fe2þ ions per 24mer. Neither of these values is consistent with previous studies: 2 Fe2þ ions bind per ferroxidase center (5, 7), and Zn2þ binds to BFR with a Kd of 1 Â 10-7 M and is a potent inhibitor of ferroxidase activity because it binds at the center with a significantly higher affinity than Fe2þ (6, 17). The fit parameters are a consequence of the fact that Fe2þ binding to BFR does not result in a linear quench response, as described in the text.

FIGURE 3: BFR subunit dimer Fe2þ binding and oxidation monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence emission titration of the BFR subunit dimer with Fe2þ ions under aerobic conditions. Excitation was at 295 nm (with excitation and emission slits of 12 and 6 nm, respectively). The BFR subunit dimer (1.2 M) was in 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.5), at 25 °C. The inset is a comparison plot of fractional intensity at 353 nm for aerobic Fe2þ titrations of the BFR subunit dimer (b) and wild-type BFR (O) as a function of Fe2þ per 24mer (i.e., the dimer is represented as the 24mer in terms of concentration).

The Majority of the Fe2þ- and Fe3þ-Induced Fluorescence Quench Occurs within Each Subunit Dimer. BFR consists of 24 identical subunits arranged as 12 subunit dimers. To determine the extent to which iron bound within one subunit dimer influences the fluorescence properties of another subunit, we employed an engineered version of E. coli BFR that does not assemble beyond a dimer of subunits but retains the ability to bind Fe2þ and catalyze its oxidation (15, 18). An aerobic titration, similar to that described above for the 24mer protein, was conducted with the BFR subunit dimer. Changes in the fluorescence spectrum with an increasing level of Fe2þ are shown in Figure 3 along with a plot of fractional intensity at 353 nm as a function of Fe2þ added per BFR (expressed, in terms of concentration, as the 24mer protein to enable a direct comparison). This revealed that Fe2þ binding and oxidation caused a significant quench, with 35% of the original intensity remaining at the end point. This was somewhat higher than in the wild-type 24mer protein (see Figure 2B), indicating that some of the observed quench in the 24mer must result from interactions that occur between subunit dimers. The shape of the plot was also somewhat different from the equivalent plot for the 24mer (inset, Figure 3). We also noted that, in the dimer sample, intensity continued to decrease beyond 48 Fe2þ (i.e., 4 per dimer), indicating that further Fe2þ ions can bind to the surface of the dimer, as previously reported (15), where they cause further minor quenching. Data from the 24mer did not indicate quenching beyond 2 irons per subunit, even though further binding of Fe2þ at an inner surface site has been observed crystallographically (5). This may be a consequence of the fact that the extent of the quench was less significant in the subunit dimer (and so "quenchable" intensity remained at 2 irons per subunit, whereas it may not in the 24mer because of additional quenching due to intersubunit dimer interactions). Despite these differences, it appears that the most significant contributions to the quench are derived from interactions within the subunit dimer. The subunit dimer data provide significant information about Fe2þ binding and oxidation and, in particular, about whether this occurs cooperatively within the subunit dimer. If positive cooperativity existed between the ferroxidase centers of the two subunits of the dimer, we would have expected to observe a linear quench response, as Fe2þ binding and oxidation at one center

would favor binding and oxidation at the other center of the dimer over binding at an unoccupied subunit dimer.3 Because a curved response was observed, we can rule out the possibility that strong positive cooperativity in Fe2þ binding and oxidation exists between subunits of the dimer. The data do not enable us to distinguish between cooperative and noncooperative binding and oxidation of Fe2þ within a single ferroxidase center, although previous data indicated that at least oxidation occurs cooperatively as oxygen or hydrogen peroxide reacts with the di-Fe2þ form of the center (6-8).
3 Addition of a substoichiometric amount of Fe2þ to the apo-BFR subunit dimer would result in the initial binding of Fe2þ at one of the two ferroxidase centers, causing a significant quench of the fluorescence due to both monomers of the dimer. Further added Fe2þ can then either bind randomly at unoccupied centers or cooperatively (positive or negative), where the binding affinity of one ferroxidase center of the subunit dimer is affected by the iron status of the other center. In the case of strong positive cooperativity, both ferroxidase centers of a single subunit dimer molecule would be filled before any of the remaining apo subunit dimers bound Fe2þ. Because binding or oxidation of Fe2þ at one ferroxidase center affects the fluorescence of the subunit to which it belongs and the other subunit of the dimer, the different binding models would result in quite different titration behavior. Both noncooperative (random) and negatively cooperative binding would result in a rapid decrease in intensity, as more and more of the subunit dimers would contain at least some (quenching) iron. This is what was observed experimentally. Note that the noncooperative and negatively cooperative situations cannot be easily distinguished. On the other hand, positively cooperative binding would result in there always being at least some apo-BFR present, right up to the point of saturation of the ferroxidase centers. In this case, the presence of the strongly fluorescent apo-BFR subunit dimer would cause the fluorescence intensity to decrease more steadily as more Fe2þ is added. In the limit of strong positive cooperativity, the observed decrease would be essentially linear as only fully occupied and fully apo forms of the subunit dimer would be present.

The Fluorescence Due to Trp133 in Wild-Type BFR Is Significantly Quenched. Each BFR subunit contains two tryptophan residues. One of these, Trp133, is located within ° 10 A of the ferroxidase center, while the other, Trp35, is more remote. To resolve the relative contributions of Trp35 and Trp133 to BFR fluorescence, W35F, W133F, and W35F/ W133F BFR proteins were generated and purified. W35F and W133F BFRs were crystallized, and their structures were determined by molecular replacement methods. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. Structures of W35F and W133F are shown in juxtaposition to the wild-type structure in Figure 4. In both W35F and W133F, the substitution of tryptophan with phenylalanine resulted in very little structural change beyond the affected residue itself. In both cases, the aromatic ring of the phenylalanine occupies the same space as the indole ring of the tryptophan wild type; however, because of the slightly smaller size of the phenyl ring, the phenylalanine variants have slightly more freedom to vibrate, giving slightly higher B factors than in the wild type (Figure 4). The structures thus confirmed that mutation did not significantly disrupt the structure of the BFR variants. Fluorescence spectra were recorded for both single variants and for the double W35F/W133F BFR variant (Figure 5A). The intensity of W35F (i.e., due to the remaining tryptophan, Trp133) was significantly lower than that of W133F (due to Trp35). The combined intensities of the two singletryptophan variants were approximately equal to that of the wildtype protein, indicating that Trp133 exhibits quenched fluorescence in wild-type BFR. This is supported by fluorescence data for the wild-type and variant proteins under denaturing conditions (see Figure 5B). The intensity due to wild-type BFR and

Saturation of phase 2 is indicated by the intersection of initial and final linear regions of the plots. Data for panels B, D, and F were derived from panels A, C, and E, respectively, and from equivalent experiments.

W133F BFR (containing Trp35) was quenched upon unfolding, while that for W35F BFR (containing Trp133) increased upon unfolding. The double variant retained fluorescence intensity, but this was much weaker and was shifted to 310 nm, characteristic of tyrosine fluorescence. Therefore, the data show that the majority of fluorescence intensity in wild-type apo-BFR is derived from Trp35. The Fluorescence Response of Wild-Type BFR to Fe2þ and Fe3þ Is Mediated via Trp133. Once it had been established that the two tryptophan residues of BFR do not contribute equally to fluorescence intensity, it was important to determine their relative contributions to the fluorescence sensitivity of wildtype BFR to Fe2þ binding and oxidation. To do this, it was first necessary to determine whether their initial Fe2þ binding and oxidation activities were altered from those of wild-type BFR. Initial Fe2þ oxidation at the ferroxidase center of BFR has been well characterized previously using stopped-flow rapid kinetic methods (6, 7, 19), and this method was also used here. Kinetic traces very similar to those previously reported for wild-type BFR were observed for both W35F and W133F BFR (Figure 6A, C), demonstrating that the rate of initial Fe2þ oxidation at the ferroxidase center in these variants was essentially unaffected.

For the W35F/W133F double variant, data indicated that phase 2 oxidation occurred at a slightly reduced rate and resulted in an overall absorption change smaller than that observed for the wild type or either single-tryptophan variant (Figure 6E). However, plots of A340 as a function of Fe2þ ions per BFR (Figure 6B,D, F) showed clearly that the phase 2 saturation characteristics of all three variants were unaffected; i.e., 2 Fe2þ ions are rapidly oxidized per BFR subunit, and we conclude that the initial binding and oxidation of Fe2þ at the ferroxidase center of each variant protein were not significantly altered relative to that of the wild-type protein. Thus, these variants were validated as potentially useful probes of the contribution of each of the tryptophan residues to the quenching behavior of the wild-type protein. The single-tryptophan variants were titrated under aerobic conditions, as described above for the wild-type protein. Figure 7A shows changes in the fluorescence spectrum following aerobic additions of Fe2þ to W35F BFR. In this variant, the major contributor to the wild-type protein's fluorescence intensity (Trp35) was not present, so the absolute intensity due to the variant was significantly lower than that of the wild type (see Figure 2). However, the extent to which the initial intensity was

quenched was essentially identical to that observed for the wildtype protein: 20% of the intensity remained after the addition of 50 Fe2þ ions per protein (Figure 7A). A plot of relative emission intensity at 353 nm as a function of iron per protein (inset, Figure 7A) showed that the shape of the plot was remarkably similar to that of the wild-type protein (plotted to aid comparison). Figure 7B shows the equivalent data for W133F BFR. The initial absolute intensity due to the variant was similar to that of the wild-type protein (because Trp133 provides only a minor contribution to the overall fluorescence), but the extent of the quench was much smaller than in wild-type (or W35F) BFR, with 78% of the initial intensity remaining after the addition of 50 Fe2þ ions per protein. The shape of the plot was also very different, and the quench was not saturated at 50 Fe2þ ions per protein (see the inset of Figure 7B). From these data, it is clear that Trp133 is much more sensitive to Fe2þ binding and oxidation than Trp35 is, consistent with the fact that Trp133 is closer to the ferroxidase center. Titration experiments conducted under anaerobic conditions, which assessed the sensitivity of the proteins to Fe2þ binding alone (see Figure S1 of the Supporting Information), were entirely consistent with this. Therefore, we conclude that Trp133, which exhibits significantly quenched fluorescence intensity in the apo wild-type protein, is principally responsible for the sensitivity of the protein to iron. In its absence (i.e., in the W133F variant), the initial fluorescence intensity (due to Trp35) was similar to that of the wild-type protein, and this was not greatly affected by the addition of Fe2þ or its oxidation to Fe3þ. This is consistent with ° Trp35 being 20 A from the ferroxidase center. In the absence of Trp35 (i.e., in the W35F variant), the remaining Trp133 residue remained partly quenched, via an unknown, iron-independent mechanism, but also remained highly sensitive to both Fe2þ and its oxidation to Fe3þ. The data indicated that the observed response of the wild-type protein must arise from a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism between Trp133 and Trp35, which results in significant quenching of the fluorescence intensity originating from the remote Trp35 residue. In the absence of Trp133, FRET cannot occur and Fe2þ and Fe3þ have a much less significant effect on the fluorescence intensity. The two tryptophan residues ° are separated by 12 A, well within the range for efficient FRET (20).

Lawson et al. with recent structural studies (5). Therefore, the fact that 100% recovery of the fluorescence intensity was not observed is most likely due to quenching by the displaced Fe3þ. Mechanistic Implications. The specific sensitivity of the BFR fluorescence signal to the iron status of the ferroxidase center provides a useful mechanistic probe. Following phase 2 oxidation of Fe2þ at the ferroxidase centers, the fluorescence intensity did not recover (Figure 2D), consistent with the bridged di-Fe3þ form of the ferroxidase center in BFR being stable (3, 5, 7, 8, 10). The data are not consistent with a mechanism in which the ferroxidase center acts as a gated pore for transfer of iron into the protein cavity (21, 22). If such a mechanism were in operation, we would expect to observe a substantial recovery of fluorescence intensity following oxidation of Fe2þ at the ferroxidase center as the iron passes into the central cavity. Such a recovery was observed for mammalian H-chain ferritin (11), in which a gated pore mechanism does operate (9, 23). Recovery of fluorescence intensity was observed, albeit slowly, following addition of Zn2þ, a potent inhibitor of the ferroxidase center, consistent with displacement of Fe3þ at the ferroxidase center by Zn2þ, and the extent of the observed recovery was dependent on the amount of Zn2þ added, becoming saturated at 2 Zn2þ ions per BFR subunit. These data demonstrate that the lability of Fe3þ from the ferroxidase center is relatively low, and that the ferroxidase center does not have a very high affinity for Fe3þ. From this, we would predict that the redox potential of the Fe3þ/Fe2þ couple at the ferroxidase center is not particularly low, consistent with a previous report that Fe3þ at the ferroxidase center iron was readily reduced by ascorbate (Em = 53 mV vs NHE at pH 7) (24). These are properties that might be anticipated for a di-iron catalytic center that can readily cycle between oxidized and reduced states. ° Concluding Remarks. Trp133, lying within 10 A of the ferroxidase center, sensitizes the overall fluorescence of the protein to Fe2þ binding and oxidation at the ferroxidase center (i.e., phases 1 and 2 of core mineralization). We propose that this occurs via a resonance energy transfer mechanism between Trp133 and the other tryptophan of the BFR subunit, Trp35, ° ° which lies 12 A from Trp133 and 20 A from the ferroxidase center. In the absence of Trp133, resonance energy transfer cannot occur by this mechanism and the fluorescence intensity is much less sensitive to iron. The data presented here are consistent with the stability of the di-Fe3þ form of the ferroxidase center, as recently demonstrated structurally (5), further supporting a mechanism in which the ferroxidase center does not operate as a gated iron pore. Finally, fluorescence spectroscopy is sensitive not only to Fe2þ binding and oxidation at the center but also to the exit of iron from the center, opening up its potential use in studying BFR variants with altered ferroxidase center properties.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION AVAILABLE Data refinement and statistics for the structures of W35F and W133F BFRs (Table S1) and sensitivities of the fluorescence intensity of BFR single-tryptophan variants to Fe2þ (Figure S1).

Although the W35F/W133F BFR variant contains no tryptophan residues, each subunit still contains seven tyrosine residues. Therefore, we investigated whether Fe2þ binding and oxidation might be followed through the tyrosine fluorescence (which is normally not observed in the wild-type protein). Figure 7C shows changes in the fluorescence emission spectrum as Fe2þ was added. Although the extent of the quench was not as great as observed in the wild-type protein (50% of the original intensity at 310 nm remained, compared to 20% for the wild type at 353 nm), the shape of the plot was very similar (inset, Figure 7C). Thus, quenching of fluorescence intensity does not appear to be ° residue specific. Two tyrosines, Tyr25 and Tyr58, lie within 6.5 A of the ferroxidase center, and it is highly likely that they are important for the sensitivity of the tyrosine fluorescence intensity to the iron status of the ferroxidase center and may also be important for the sensitivity of Trp133, via a FRET mechanism similar to that proposed to connect the two tryptophan residues (see above). Fluorescence-Detected Displacement of Iron from the BFR Ferroxidase Center. We have shown here that binding of Fe2þ ions to BFR under aerobic conditions leads to a major quench of the tryptophan fluorescence intensity, due to contributions from both Fe2þ binding and oxidation. It is well established that Zn2þ ions can inhibit core formation in BFR by binding tightly at the ferroxidase center (6, 17), and we recently determined the structure of a Zn2þ-bound form of BFR, which revealed Zn2þ at the center (and nowhere else) (5). Therefore, it was of interest to assess the effect of Zn2þ on BFR fluorescence intensity. The addition of 50 Zn2þ ions per BFR resulted in a small quench, to 85% of the original intensity (see Figure 8A). The addition of 50 Fe2þ ions to the same sample resulted in only a minor decrease in fluorescence intensity, consistent with the ability of Zn2þ to effectively block Fe2þ binding at the ferroxidase center. This also demonstrates that the fluorescence intensity is not very sensitive to Fe2þ bound at locations other than the ferroxidase center. Our recent crystallographic studies showed that, when Zn2þ ions occupy the ferroxidase center, Fe2þ ions can ° still bind to a novel inner surface site, which itself is 10 A from the ferroxidase center (5). The effect of Zn2þ on a sample of BFR already containing 50 Fe3þ ions (added as Fe2þ ions under aerobic conditions) was also investigated. Figure 8A shows that the quench resulting from the binding and oxidation of Fe2þ ions was reversed upon addition of 50 Zn2þ ions per BFR, recovering to 70% of the original intensity over a period of 30 min. Thus, the data demonstrate that the fluorescence intensity is sensitive not only to iron binding at the ferroxidase center but also to it leaving the center and is, therefore, a sensitive probe of the iron status of the center. That a full recovery of the intensity relative to that observed for 50 Zn2þ ions per BFR was not observed indicated either that Zn2þ could not displace all of the Fe3þ or that the displaced Fe3þ maintained some capacity to quench the fluorescence intensity. To investigate this further, a titration of BFR already containing 50 Fe3þ ions (added as Fe2þ ions under aerobic conditions) with variable amounts of Zn2þ was performed (see Figure 8B). This showed that the extent of the recovery was dependent on the ratio of Zn2þ added, and that it was saturated at a level of 50 Zn2þ ions per BFR. This indicates that Zn2þ is able to displace all of the iron from the ferroxidase center, resulting in a di-Zn2þ form of the ferroxidase center, consistent with mechanistic studies that demonstrated that Zn2þ is an effective inhibitor of mineralization in BFR even when it contains a significant iron core (10), and
