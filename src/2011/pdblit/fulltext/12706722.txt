The crystal structure of abrin-a, a type II ribosome-inactivating protein from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, has been determined from a novel crystalline form by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of ricin. The structure has been refined at 2.14 Å to a R-factor of 18.9%. The root-mean-square deviations of bond lengths and angles from the standard values are 0.013 Å and 1.82°, respectively. The overall protein folding is similar to that of ricin, but there are differences in the secondary structure, mostly of the A-chain. Several parts of the molecular surface differ significantly; some of them are quite near the active site cleft, and probably influence ribosome recognition. The positions of invariant active site residues remain the same, except the position of Tyr74. Two water molecules of hydrogen-bonded active site residues have been located in the active site cleft. Both of them may be responsible for hydrolyzing the N­C glycosidic bond. The current abrin-a structure is lactose free; this is probably essential for abrin-a crystallization. The B-chain is a glycoprotein, and the positions of several sugar residues of two sugar chains linked to earlier predicted glycosylation sites were determined. One of the sugar chains is a bridge between two neighboring molecules, since one of its mannose residues is connected to the galactose binding site of the neighboring molecule. Another sugar chain covers the surface of the B-chain. Keywords: abrin-a; ribosome-inactivating proteins; antibacterial and antitumor protein; X-ray structure; Abrus precatorius

Introduction
Abrin-a is one of the four isoabrins isolated from the seeds of Abrus precatorius, and is anticarcinogenic (Lin et al., 1981, 1982). The anticarcinogenic activity includes the inhibition of protein biosynthesis (Olsnes & Pihl, 1982) by the cleavage of the A4324 residue from the 28 S ribosomal RNA (Endo et al., 1987). Abrin is composed of an A-chain linked by a disulfide bond to a B-chain. The B-chain is an all-binding lectin, and the A-chain kills cells by its glycosidase activity. The abrin A-chain has been used to prepare immunotoxins, and shows selective

anticarcinogenic activities in laboratory animal tests (Thorpe et al., 1987). The ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) were divided into two classes, type I and type II (Stirpe et al., 1992). Type II RIPs are highly cytotoxic, while type I RIPs are relatively non-cytotoxic. Recently, significant progress has been made in the structure determination of several type I RIPs and their complexes with substrate analogs. The reported protein structures include a pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) and its complexes with formycin-5'monophosphate (Monzingo et al., 1993), momordin (Husain et al., 1994), trichosanthin (Pan et al., 1992; Gao et al., 1993; Xia et al., 1993) and its complex with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) (Xiong et al., 1994) and the recombinant ricin A-chain (Mlsna et al., 1993; Weston et al., 1993). Abrin, like ricin, modeccin and mistletoe protein, belongs to the type II RIPs. Ricin is the only type II RIP whose three-dimensional X-ray structure has been reported (Montfort et al., 1987; Rutenber et al., 1991) and described in detail (Katzin et al., 1991; Rutenber & Robertus, 1991). The structures of the ricin complexes with formycin-5'-monophosphate and adenyl(3'-5')guanosine were also reported, and

the mechanism of ricin action, which is also relevant to known RIPs, was proposed (Ready et al., 1991; Monzingo & Robertus, 1992). Recently, attempts were made to solve another type II RIP, mistletoe lectin, whose crystals contain 24 molecules per unit cell (Sweeney et al., 1993). Three crystal forms of abrin were obtained by other laboratories in 1973. One of the reported crystals contained four protein molecules in an asymmetric unit, and diffracted to a resolution of ° 3 A (McPherson et al., 1973). Two other reported crystal forms contained two abrin molecules in an asymmetric unit. One of these diffracted only to a ° resolution of 6 A (Wei, 1973). The other diffracted better, but was sensitive to X-radiation (Wei & Einstein, 1973). Since 1973, there has been no further investigation of the three-dimensional structure of these abrin crystals. Recently, we reported a new crystal form of abrin-a (Tahirov et al., 1994) which contained only one molecule in an asymmetric unit, and diffracted to a resolution ° up to 2.1 A. The three-dimensional X-ray crystallographic structure of this abrin-a crystal is reported herein.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows a ribbon representation of the abrin-a molecule. The A-chain, shown in red, was situated in the lower part of the molecule, and the yellow B-chain was situated in the upper part. These two chains were connected by the disulfide bond formed between Cys247 of the A-chain and Cys8 of the B-chain. The abrin-a molecule is very similar to the ricin molecule, the structure of which has been described in detail (Katzin et al., 1991; Rutenber & Robertus, 1991). Figure 2 shows a comparison of the backbones of the abrin-a and ricin molecules. The structures are very similar, even with the sequence difference in the residues. The root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.), calculated only for structurally related a-carbon atoms of abrin-a and ricin ° molecules, was 1.46 A. This value is greater than that calculated separately for the A-chains, which is ° ° 1.40 A, and for the B-chains, 0.98 A. This difference is caused by different interactions of the subunits in abrin-a and ricin molecules. The differences in the a-carbon tracings, which occurred mainly due to differences in the lengths of the A- and B-chains

caused by insertions and deletions during alignment, will be discussed below. Structure of the abrin-a A-chain The abrin-a A-chain was divided into three folding domains by reference to the description of the ricin A-chain (Montfort et al., 1987). Figure 3 shows a ribbon representation of the abrin-a A-chain backbone. Domain 1, composed of residues 1 to 109, consists of a six-stranded b-sheet (strands a to f) and two helices, helix A, consisting of residues 14 to 28, and helix B, residues 93 to 97. The strands and helices alternate in the order aAbcdeBf. The first strand, a, of the b-sheet and the last strand, f, lie parallel to the neighboring strands, b and e, respectively. The four central strands of the b-sheet, b to e, are antiparallel. The main differences in domains 1 of abrin-a and ricin occur in loops and N termini. The N-terminal of the abrin-a A-chain is four residues shorter than that of the ricin A-chain, and the first four terminal residues are disordered. Two deletions in loop Ab (the loop between helix A and strand b) influence the locations of residues Gly30 and Gly31, and easily accommodate these changes. The conformation of loop bc, residues 58 to

62, takes a ``boat'' form in abrin-a and a ``chair'' form in ricin. The reason for these differences is the replacement of Ala14 in ricin by Glu10 in abrin-a. The OE1 of Glu10 is hydrogen-bonded via water molecule 88 to the OD1 and N of Asp60, and thus stabilizes the structure of the loops aA and bc. If residues 58 to 62 of abrin-a adopted the conformation present in ricin, then the side chains of Glu10 and Asp60 would be in conflict. The folding of the loop eB and the helix B of abrin-a itself differ significantly from those of ricin. The helix B of abrin-a has seven residues fewer at the start, and only a small part of this helix is present. Domain 2, residues 110 to 197, is the most conserved part of the abrin-a and ricin A-chains, and is dominated by five helices, C to G. Helices C, composed of residues 113 to 119, E, residues 148 to 167, F, residues 169 to 180 and G, residues 189 to 196, are very similar to the corresponding helices in ricin. Only helix D, residues 131 to 142, differs significantly. As a result of deletions at the end, this helix is three residues shorter than the end of helix D in ricin. Domain 3, composed of residues 198 to 251, contains two helices, H, residues 198 to 207 and I, residues 235 to 239, and the b pattern of two antiparallel strands, g and h, situated in the order HghI, and a random coil

357 The active site architecture The location of the active site region of the abrin-a A-chain is shown in Figure 1. Five invariant residues (Tyr74, Tyr113, Glu164, Arg167 and Trp198) and five conserved residues (Asn72, Arg124, Gln160, Glu195 and Asn196) are located in the active site cleft. The alignment of the amino acid sequences shows that all five invariant residues in the active site of abrin-a are absolutely conserved throughout the wide range of RIPs (Funatsu et al., 1991; Katzin et al., 1991). Recent analyses of the crystal structures of ricin, trichosanthin, PAP, momordin and the current structure of abrin-a indicate that the overall architecture of the active site cleft remains constant in all these proteins. But the fine structures, including the orientation of some side-chains and the number of water molecules and hydrogen bonding nets, are varied. Three peaks from the 2(Fo­Fc ) and (Fo - Fc ) maps are found in the active site region of the refined structure. Two of the peaks are spherical and defined as water molecules numbers 173 and 194, and their bonding is described below. But a larger area of density, even with the highest contour level (6.9 s in the (Fo - Fc ) omit map) is located in the gap in the active site where an adenine molecule is expected to be in the complexed molecule. In the present model, we defined this peak as water molecule number 55, and it is probably replaced by an adenine ring during the formation of the complex. This water molecule is quite far from the side-chains and close to water molecule 173 at a resolution of ° 4.41 A. Figure 4(a) shows the active site structure and its hydrogen bonding pattern in detail. The positions of Trp198 and Arg167 are fixed by direct hydrogen-bonds to the main chain, NE1(Trp198) to O(Leu242) and NH2(Arg167) to O(Asn72). The hydroxyl molecule of Tyr173 is hydrogen-bonded to the OE2 of Glu164 and the OE1 of Glu164 hydrogenbonded to the NH1 of Arg167. The orientation of the side-chains of the invariant active site residues Tyr113, Glu164, Arg167 and Trp198 and the hydrogen-bonds mentioned above are the same in the structure of ricin. The position of the active site water molecule number 173 differs from the position of its analogue in ricin, number 323. This water molecule makes a strong hydrogen-bond with O(Glu195), a closer approach to both Arg167 and Glu164, makes hydrogen-bonds with NH1 of Arg167 and OE1 and OE2 of Glu164. Another major difference is the orientation of the side group of Tyr74 as illustrated in Figure 4(b). In ricin, the position of this residue is fixed by the strong hydrogen bond of its hydroxyl to the carboxyl oxygen of Gly121 (ricin nomenclature). In abrin-a, the hydroxyl of Tyr74 is hydrogen-bonded via water molecule number 194 to OD1 of Asp199, and the aromatic rings of Tyr74 and Tyr113 are almost parallel. It seems that the architecture of both invariant tyrosine side-chains is the most appropriate for sandwiching the planar adenine without the need for major changes in their orientation. In ricin, PAP and trichosanthin, it is necessary to rotate the tyrosine side-chains to

in the C terminal part. The loop Hg in abrin-a differs slightly from that in ricin. The protein folding after strand h, which includes the loop hI and the helix I, is significantly different from the folding in the corresponding part of the ricin molecule. The 310 helix, labelled I in abrin, is a random coil in ricin. The C-terminal of the abrin-a A-chain is four residues shorter. All the differences between abrin and ricin A-chain folding mentioned above may influence ribosome recognition and binding (Endo et al., 1991). The most obvious example is the difference in the loop eB (residues 88 to 93 in abrin and 94 to 103 in ricin), which is quite near to the beginning of the active site region, and, as mentioned above, folds differently and occupies less volume in abrin-a than in ricin. As a result, different ribosomes can be attacked and inactivated by abrin-a, as well as by ricin. The abrin A-chain immunotoxins are sevenfold more potent than the ricin A-chain immunotoxins (Forrester et al., 1984; Sivam et al., 1987). In addition to the differences in the molecular surfaces of abrin-a and ricin A-chains discussed above, the differences in the active site structure, which also can influence protein potency, are discussed below.

accommodate the adenine between them (Monzingo & Robertus, 1992; Monzingo et al., 1993; Xiong et al., 1994). The low density for the aromatic ring of Tyr74, ° and the high B factor of this side-chain, 47.5 A2, compared to average B factors of other invariant ° active side-chain residues of 12.1 A2, suggest that this side-chain is disordered, and this probably explains its high mobility. At present, however, no statistical evidence has been found for the disordered state of Tyr74, although omit maps are quite clear around it. Recently, Husain et al. (1994) compared the active

sites of all reported three-dimensional structures of RIPs and their complexes (excluding the structure of trichosanthin). They found that the most variable residue in the active site was tyrosine (the equivalent of Tyr74 in abrin-a). The side-chain of this tyrosine residue occupied a range of positions. According to the existing concept of the protein inhibitor activity of RIPs, the key residues which are directly involved in catalytic processes are invariant arginine and glutamic acid residues (Monzingo & Robertus, 1992). The role of the tyrosine rings is probably that of

Crystal Structure of Abrin-a

359 recently reported structure of the trichosanthin­ NADPH complex refined at high resolution demonstrates such bonding (Xiong et al., 1994). The invariant tyrosine residues of the active site of ricin were subject to site-directed mutagenesis. The Y80F and Y123F substitutions reduced protein activity by only 15-fold and sevenfold, respectively (Ready et al., 1991). The planar aromatic rings of the Phe80 and Phe123 mutants of ricin fulfil the functions of the tyrosine rings mentioned above. However, the absence of hydrogen-bonds in the side-chains of the Phe80 and Phe123 mutants probably makes them more flexible and weakens their adenine keeping and directing property. This may cause the reduction in activity. The deletions in active site tyrosine side-chains, or other mutations, will probably cause high loss of activity, since the substrate within the active site cleft may approach other attractive, but not catalytic, sites. It has been shown that other RIPs damage eukaryotic ribosomes, as the ricin A-chain does (Endo et al., 1988). Comparison with known RIP crystal structures confirms this. Due to the similarity of active site structures, especially the positions of Glu164 and Arg167, in abrin-a and ricin, the mechanism of action proposed for ricin (Monzingo & Robertus, 1992) is also applicable to abrin-a. Glu164 and Arg167 are the main residues of abrin-a involved in the catalytic process of hydrolysis of the N­C glycosidic bond. Three mutants of abrin-a (E164A, R167L, double mutant E164A and R167L) were constructed, and these showed 25-fold, 625-fold and 1250-fold loss of activity, respectively (Hung et al., 1994). A comparable small reduction in activity of

forming a route for the substrate by keeping adenine strictly parallel to the plane of their aromatic rings. This makes a favorable orientation for adenine, so that its N3 can approach arginine and make a hydrogen-bond with it. In addition, such an orientation of adenine will allow the O-3' of ribose to approach Glu164 and form a hydrogen-bond. The

It has been proposed and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray analysis that after E177A substitution, Glu208 replaces Glu177 and fulfills its function (Frankel et al., 1990; Kim et al., 1992). In the case of the E164A mutant of abrin-a, Glu195 also can easily replace Glu164. Such replacement can be achieved by the rotation of the Glu195 side-chain without major changes in the structure of the backbone. The water molecule number 173 in abrin-a may be the ultimate nucleophile of the N-glycosidase reaction, like water molecule number 323 in ricin (Katzin et al., 1991; Ready et al., 1991). In the ricin complex with formycin monophosphate, the water molecule number 323 has not been located (Monzingo & Robertus, 1992). Another candidate for the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond was found in the trichosanthin-NADPH complex (Xiong et al., 1994). This water molecule is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl of the tyrosine residue (Tyr74 in abrin-a), and approaches the N-C glycosidic bond. In abrin-a, the water molecule number 194 which forms a strong hydrogen-bond with the hydroxyl of Tyr74 also can be considered as another candidate for the hydrolysis of the N-C glycosidic bond, since it may relocate during the depurination reaction.

Crystal Structure of Abrin-a

Structure of the abrin-a B-chain The overall folding of the abrin-a B-chain and the ricin B-chain is very similar, as shown in Figure 2, but the a-carbon traces of their N termini, residues 1 to 12, and of several loops (residues 39 to 45, 100 to 106, 109 to 118, 133 to 139, 166 to 170 and 193 to 204) differ significantly. The abrin-a B-chain is composed of two homologous domains, each of them consisting of four subdomains, l, a, b and g. The ribbon drawing of the B-chain, with highlighted subdomains and their peptide connections, is shown in Figure 5. The main body of each domain formed by the a, b and g subdomains is situated around a pseudo-threefold axis. Subdomain 2l connects two domains of the B-chain, and subdomain 1l participates in the disulfide bonding of the A- and B-chains. Both l subdomains are homologous, but are different from others. All a, b and g subdomains of the two domains are homologous. The lengths in all the subdomains of the abrin-a B-chain, except the 1l subdomain, are equal to the corresponding lengths of the subdomains of the ricin B-chain. The 1l subdomain in the abrin-a B-chain has one inserted, and four extra amino acid residues at the N terminus when the sequence is compared and aligned with that of the 1l subdomain of the ricin B-chain. The amino acid alignment for subdomains, a, b and g of both

domains, based on structural similarity, is shown in Table 1. Unlike the previous alignment based on maximal amino acid identity (Chen et al., 1992; see Table 1), no gaps were introduced on subdomain 1a during this alignment. In the case of the ricin B-chain, one gap was introduced on subdomain 1a during the alignment based on structural similarity (Rutenber & Robertus, 1991). Each of the B-chain domains of abrin-a contains a cylindrical hydrophobic core similar to that found in ricin. The superposition of the residues in the main hydrophobic core for each of the corresponding domains of the B-chains in abrin-a and in ricin is shown in Figure 6. Some differences which appear in subdomains a and b of domain 2, i.e. on top of the core cylinder, are due to the substitutions of the Leu residues in ricin with Met residues in abrin-a. All the residues in the triangular arrangement in the main hydrophobic core, and another two wider hydrophobic triangles which are situated below the main core, are indicated in Table 1. Previously, Rutenber et al. (1987) suggested the evolutionary theory for the development of the ricin B-chain. According to this theory, the ancestor of the modern B-chain was the 1a subdomain, since only this peptide unit retains all key structural and functional futures. Gene duplication and fusion then

produced an abg molecule. The addition of the l-peptide further stabilized the structure, and another duplication produced the current (labg)2 motif. The current research shows that the molecule of the abrin-a B-chain is another perfect example of such protein evolution. Structure of the sugar chains and their association with the protein molecule The carbohydrate content of the abrin-a molecule has been determined, and demonstrates that the B-chain contains five times more carbohydrate than the A-chain does (Lin et al., 1981). The abrin-a B-chain has two potential galactose binding sites, Asn51 and Asn260 (Chen et al., 1992). McPherson (1982) mentioned that abrin cannot crystallize in the presence of its specific sugar, galactose. This is also true for the current form, abrin-a. Our crystallization experiments demonstrated that only galactose- or lactose-free abrin-a can be crystallized. In addition, its affinity for galactosides causes abrin-a to also be classified as a glycoprotein. The amino acid sequences around the two glycosylation sites and the structures of the sugar chains of the abrin-a B-chain were determined and described by Kimura et al. (1988). The present structural analysis indicates

362

clearly that the main reason that only lactose-free abrin-a will grow crystals is the bonding of the sugar chains found in the abrin-a structure. The electron density of the superimposed sugars of the first carbohydrate chain is shown in Figure 7. It is interesting that the density for this chain is located between two neighboring molecules. Therefore, in the crystal, the first sugar chain is a bridge between the two abrin-a molecules, connecting them to a linear polymer. The position of the N­acetylglucosamine, Nag1, on one end of the bridge, is very similar to that in ricin. The ND2 of Asn100 makes hydrogen-bonds with O5 of Nag1, and the hydroxyl of Tyr130 with N2 of Nag1, as shown in the upper part of Figure 8. The mannose, Man4, was located on the other end of the bridge, and occupied the position where there would probably be a galactose in abrin-a containing lactose. In the case of ricin, the same position would be occupied by a galactose molecule instead of one of the two lactose molecules. The hydrogen-bonds between this sugar residue and the protein molecule are probably Asp27(OD1)Man4(O6 ), Asn51(ND2)-Man4(O6 ), Asn31(OD1)Man4(O4 ) and Asp30(N)-Man4(O3 ). Another mannose residue, Man5, also makes a hydrogen-bond to a protein residue, Asn31(O)-Man5(O6 ). Two water molecules, numbers 139 and 153, are also intermediate in protein interactions with sugars via hydrogen-bonds. The possible hydrogen-bonding pattern is shown in the lower part of Figure 8. A heavy density for the two N-acetylglucosamines of

the second sugar chain appears in another expected glycosylation site, which includes the main binding residue, Asn140, HD2 of which forms two strong hydrogen bonds with Nag1(O4 ) and Nag2(O5 ). Another possible hydrogen bond, between the B-chain and the second sugar chain, is Gln216(NE2)Nag1(O6 ). The density shows that the superimposed second sugar chain must wrap up the molecular surface, instead of being in perpendicular orientation with the molecular surface. The reported structure does not contain information about the location of other sugar residues. The modelling of possible sugar-chain architecture based on current data, and their interaction with the abrin-a molecule, will be reported elsewhere. It is likely that the two sugar chains are connected, and a long single chain, instead of two, exists in the structure. We hope that more accurate structural determination of abrin-a at high resolution will help to locate the rest of the sugar chains, and to establish the interaction of sugar chains with the protein molecule more precisely.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of abrin-a Abrins were extracted from the beans of A. precatorius obtained from local sources by homogenizing 200 g of A. precatorius kernels in 1 liter of 5% (w/v) cold acetic acid with a stainless Waring blender. The supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate after the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 minutes. The proteins

which precipitated between 35% and 95% (w/v) saturation of ammonium sulfate were collected and dialyzed against 0.005 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). After dialysis, the resulting sample was centrifugated at 10,000 g for 20 minutes. The supernatant was applied to a Sepharose 4B column (3 × 45 cm). The column was first washed with 0.005 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 M NaCl, and then eluted with 0.1 M D-galactose. The material eluted with 0.1 M D-galactose was further purified on a Sephadex G-100 column (2.5 × 100 cm). The column was eluted with 0.001 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Two peaks were obtained; the second peak was identified as abrin-a, while the first peak was abrus agglutinin. Crystallization The sparse matrix screening method for protein crystallization was used as suggested by Jancarik & Kim (1991). The selected condition was further modified, and the crystals were grown by using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method (McPherson, 1982) from the reservoir solution containing 0.09 M ammonium sulfate and 13.5% (w/v) PEG 8000. A precipitate appeared in three to four hours after mixing this solution with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml of protein aqueous solution. The liquor was prepared by removing the precipitate by centrifugation at

5000 g for five minutes. Crystals suitable for high resolution X-ray diffraction study appeared in eight to ten weeks. X-ray data collection For X-ray diffraction analysis, a 0.25 mm × 0.40 mm × 0.35 mm crystal was selected. Unit cell dimensions were determined, and intensity data were collected on a San Diego Multiwire system (Hamlin, 1985) with a graphite monochromated CuKa X-ray generated by a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode at 50 kV and 50 mA. The crystal was ° stable for X-ray, and diffracted to at least 2.1 A. The general data collection strategy was similar to that described by Xuong et al., (1985). Data processing, including local scaling, Lorentz and polarization corrections and merging to a unique set, was carried out with a program package supplied with the area detector system (Howard et al., 1985). The number of observations was 113,198 for 27,470 ° unique reflections to a resolution of 2.2 A with an Rmerge of 8.26% for all 113,198 measurements. The completeness of the data was 92.2%. The refined cell dimensions were ° ° ° a = 84.58 A, b = 73.07 A, c = 48.23 A, b = 96.20°, and the space group was P21 . The crystal contained one molecule of molecular weight 65 kDa in an asymmetric unit. The Vm value was calculated to be 2.3% (v/v) by assuming one molecule per asymmetric unit; this indicates that the

Crystal Structure of Abrin-a

Figure 9. Ramachandran plot of abrin-a. All residues of the A- and B-chains are included. The glycine residues are shown as triangles. The percentage of residues with (f, 8) conformational angles in the most favoured regions (A, B, L) is 86.0%. In additional allowed regions (0a, 0b, 0l, 0p) this percentage is 13.3%, and in the generously allowed regions (a,b,l,p) it is 0.7%. Proline, glycine and the end residues are excluded from percentage calculations. In the generously allowed regions, the labelled residues Asp35 belong to the A-chain, and Val2 and Ser5 belong to the B-chain.

solvent content is approximately 46% according to the Matthews equation (1968). Molecular modeling A molecular model for abrin-a was constructed by using the coordinates of ricin obtained from the Protein Data Bank at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Montfort et al., 1987; Rutenber et al., 1991; Bernstein et al., 1977; Abola et al., 1987). The residue homology of ricin and abrin-a is 42% for the A-chain and 59% for the B-chain. The primary structure of abrin-a, used for modelling, was determined from the protein sequence of the A-chain (Funatsu et al., 1988) and the B-chain (Chen et al., 1992). Later, the amino acid sequence of abrin-a deduced from cDNA sequences (Hung et al., 1993) were used. One residue, Ser202, was added in the A-chain, and three residues, Leu166, Pro206 and Leu222, were replaced by Met166, Thr206 and Val222 in the B-chain. Molecular modelling was performed using PROTEIN DESIGN and the model was refined using CHARMM energy minimization (Brooks et al., 1983), both implemented in the QUANTA program for molecular graphics analysis. Molecular replacement The coordinates of the model of abrin-a were used. A generalized molecular replacement technique based on Patterson correlation (PC) refinement (Brunger, 1990a) was employed for rotation searches using version 2.1 of the

XPLOR program package (Brunger, 1990b). An X-ray ° ° diffraction data shell from 15 A to 4 A was used for the calculation of the cross rotation function. A good result was produced from the rotation search; the first peak was 11.3 s, and the second peak 8.9 s. The first 50 peaks were refined by the PC procedure. The highest PC coefficient was 0.25 for the first peak (second peak 0.06). This corresponds to a rotation of the abrin model by the rotation angles of u1 = 243.6°, u2 = 67.8°, u3 = 197.6°. In the subsequent translation searches, using a data shell for ° rotation at a grid size of 0.5 A, the position of the abrin-a molecule was determined in fractional coordinates at x = 0.226, y = 0, z = 0.238, with a correlation coefficient of 30 s (the next two peaks had correlation coefficients of 28 s and 25 s). Crystallographic refinement Structural refinements were performed using the conjugate gradient minimization and simulated annealing (SA) protocols of the XPLOR program package with the parameters set parhcsdx.pro, as described by Engh & Huber (1991). For all calculations, diffraction data from ° ° 10 A to 2.14 A was included. The crystallographic R-factor dropped from 46.5% to 32.3% after rigid-body refinement of the whole molecule and the separate A- and B-chains, and after the first round of conventional positional refinement. The backbone of the first 12 N-terminal residues of the B-chain were relocated manually, and inserted into the appropriate density. For this model, SA

refinement was applied, and the R-factor was reduced to 29.0%, with the energy of the structure equal to 5656 kcal/mol. The first SA refined model was defined as M1. The 2(Fo - Fc ) and (Fo - Fc ) difference Fourier maps were inspected for further manual intervention by using the X-RAY STRUCTURE ANALYSIS implemented in the QUANTA molecular graphics analysis program. For all the regions of initial low density (less than 1.5 s on the 2(Fo - Fc ) map), the omit maps and the SA omit maps were calculated (Hodel et al., 1992). The backbones of several regions were traced again. These regions included residue ranges 1 to 7, 29 to 32, 40 to 52, 58 to 62, 88 to 115, 138 to 148 and 220 to 251 in the A-chain, and 166 to 177 and 193 to 214 in the B-chain. After two rounds of major model rebuilding and refinement, two oligosaccharides were obtained, whose structures are as shown: Mana1 to 6 % Manb1 to 4GlcNAcb1 to 4GlcNAc $ Mana1 to 3 These were inserted into the positions derived from the (Fo - Fc ) difference electron density map. After each of the two rounds of major manual intervention, the structure was refined by SA refinement using a starting temperature of 3500 K. Each of several rounds of minor manual intervention was followed by positional refinement. When manual intervention was finished, the SA refinement from a starting temperature of 4000 K was performed, then the overall and individual temperature factors were refined. The R-factor at this stage was 21.7%, and the energy of the structure was 2866 kcal/mol. The solvent molecules were then tentatively located. These were accepted, and placed in accordance with the peaks of the (Fo - Fc ) difference Fourier maps, with values above 3.0 s if they were within ° 3 A of a protein molecule or a water molecule. The number of accepted solvent molecules was 200. In the final refinement, the R-factor was reduced to 18.9% for ° ° 24,800 reflections, with F e 2 s(F) from 10 A to 2.14 A resolution. The total number of non-hydrogen atoms was 4411. The estimated error of the coordinate position was ° about 0.255 A, as determined by the Luzatti plot. The ° ° average B factors were 27.5 A2 and 23.6 A2 for the backbone atoms of the A-chain and B-chain, respectively, ° ° 28.5 A2 for all protein atoms, 35.3 A2 for water oxygen, and ° 58.4 A2 for carbohydrate atoms, with lower values for N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to the protein ° ° molecule, 28.7 A2 for the first sugar chain, and 36.8 A2 for the second sugar chain. There was a gradual increase toward the mannose branches extending into the solvent. The r.m.s.d. values from standard values for bond length, bond angles, torsional angles and impropers were ° 0.013 A, 1.82°, 26.12° and 1.53°, respectively. The r.m.s.d. for the difference in the a-carbon positions between ° model M1 and the final model was 1.76 A for the A-chain ° and 0.79 A for the B-chain. The Ramachandran plots drawn by the program PROCHECK (Lakowski et al., 1993) are shown in Figure 9. No non-glycine residues with dihedral angles of f and 8 were in the disallowed regions, and only three of these residues were in the generously allowed regions. The atomic coordinates of the refined abrin-a structure and the reflection data have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Chemistry Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973, USA; Bernstein et al., 1977; Abola et al., 1987). The accession number for these atomic coordinates is 1ABR.
