Nucleotide regulates the affinity of the bacterial chaperonin GroEL for protein substrates. GroEL binds protein substrates with high affinity in the absence of ATP and with low affinity in its presence. We report the ° crystal structure of (GroEL-KMgATP)14 refined to 2.0 A resolution in which the ATP triphosphate moiety is directly coordinated by both Kþ and Mg2þ. Upon the binding of KMgATP, we observe previously unnoticed domain rotations and a 1028 rotation of the apical domain surface helix I. Two major consequences are a large lateral displacement of, and a dramatic reduction of hydrophobicity in, the apical domain surface. These results provide a basis for the nucleotide-dependent regulation of protein substrate binding and suggest a mechanism for GroEL-assisted protein folding by forced unfolding.

Introduction
Many newly synthesized polypeptides are cyclically subjected to refolding by ATP-dependent protein folding machines before assuming their final folded forms.1 ­ 3 The bacterial chaperonin GroEL/ co-chaperonin GroES system is one such machine and the best-understood system.2,4 GroEL is a tetradecamer composed of two back-to-back stacked heptamers while GroES is a single heptamer.2,5 ­ 7 Although GroES may bind to both ends of GroEL to form a symmetric complex8,9 and the symmetric complex may have some biological functions under physiological conditions,10,11 an asymmetric complex of only one GroES bound to GroEL is widely considered to be biologically relevant.2,12 ­ 14 The reaction cycle of this machine begins with the binding of a partially unfolded protein substrate, followed by further unfolding upon ATP binding before the substrate is released.4,15 ­ 18 The binding of GroES to GroEL to form the asymmetric GroEL/GroES complex requires first the binding of ATP to GroEL. The resulting complex has a large central cavity between GroEL and GroES where protein refolding occurs for small protein

substrates that can be encapsulated inside it.19 ­ 21 The large protein substrates that cannot be encapsulated inside it refold on the opposite GroEL cavity.20,21 ATP hydrolysis serves as a timer for cycling the reaction.13,22 Structural changes occur in GroEL at each of the reaction intermediate states as implied from its allostery.23 Examination of initial ATP hydrolysis rates (Vo) of GroEL24 leads to the conclusion that there are two ATP-induced allosteric transitions between the unliganded (T) and the liganded (R) states. In the first transition, each heptameric ring is in equilibrium between the T and R states that inter-convert in a concerted manner in accordance with the Monod ­Wyman ­Changeux (MWC) representation.25 This positive cooperativity is due to effects on binding, but not catalysis.26,27 In the second transition, a sequential Koshland ­ Nemethy­ Filmer (KNF)-type transition occurs between the two rings of GroEL,28 from the TT (one state for each ring, T and T) state to the RR state via the asymmetric TR state. This is due to negative cooperativity between the two rings. The KNF transition is intermediately nested inside the MWC transition.24 The allostery of ATP binding in GroEL is further modulated by Kþ, GroES, and unfolded protein substrates.23 GroES binding reduces the cooperativity of the T to R transition,27,29 while increasing the cooperativity in

the structural transition involved in ATP hydrolysis. Upon GroES binding, all seven ATPs bound within one ring simultaneously hydrolyze in a highly cooperative "quantal" manner.30 Unfolded protein substrates preferentially bind to the T state, but not to the R state.31 The binding of ATP causes the release of bound protein substrates. In this step GroEL actively catalyzes their unfolding as an unfoldase.18,32 This forced unfolding of protein substrates occurs before ATP hydrolysis without requiring GroES.33 Many structural changes have been characterized during the GroEL assisted protein folding reaction cycle using electron microscopic (EM) studies and X-ray crystallography.2,34 Three states, the apo-structure in TT state,5,35 the ATP-bound RR state,36 and the ADP-bound asymmetric GroEL/GroES complex in the RT state,37 were captured at high resolution by X-ray crystallography in the previous studies. Unlike the EM studies,38 ­ 41 we were unable to observe structural changes during the T to R transition. This was in part due to inaccuracy in our previous model. ° Here, we report the 2.0 A crystal structure of (GroEL-KMgATP)14 using our previous experimental data.36 This analysis used nearly twice as many ° data as our original 2.4 A resolution structure and resulted in a better model with free R-factors lower by 4 ­8%. This structure reveals many new features that we did not see in the previous study, as well as many important structural features present in our previous model that had unfortunately gone unnoticed. These include new details of metal ion coordination to bound ATP, previously unnoticed global domain rotations and a local rotation of apical surface helix I along its helical axis between the ATP-bound and apo-structures.35 We propose that the observed large lateral movement of one apical surface relative to its neighbor can be used to force unfolding of bound protein substrates, and that the observed dramatic reduction of hydrophobic property of the apical domain surface can cause the release of the bound protein substrates, allowing for refolding upon binding of ATP that triggers the T to R transition.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure Extensive model rebuilding was carried out to extend our previously reported (GroEL-ATPgS)14 ° ° structure36 from 2.4 A to 2.0 A resolution. There are 14 GroEL independent subunits in the asymmetric unit (named from A to G in one ring and from H to N in the second ring). The model has a ° free R-factor of 25.8% at 2.0 A resolution with excellent geometry (Table 1), and is a muchimproved structure, as evident in electron density maps (Figures 1 and 2). Coordinate errors at the ATP binding site in the equatorial domains (with much smaller temperature factors) should be

Stereochemistry of KMgATP This structure unambiguously reveals the stereochemistry of bound nucleotide triphosphate and metal ions (Figure 1). ATP is bound in both rings, which may be related to the R13G mutation that lacks negative allostery.42 As described previously,36 one metal ion is Mg2þ with nearly

perfect octahedral coordination. The triphosphate moiety provides three ligands, one from each phosphate. The other three ligands are the D87 sidechain and two water molecules (numbers 555 and 556). Average coordinate bond length from all 14

(B) An example of a sA-weighted 2Fo 2 Fc map using model phases shows a part of apical domain in which some of the main-chain carbonyl atoms begin visible at the intermediate (green)­ apical (red) domain interface.

Equatorial, intermediate, and apical domains are colored in cyan, green, and red, respectively. (D) The revised model (red) differs from the original model (yellow) near the apical-apical interface, residues 178­ 186, 228­ 233, 241­ 246, 267­ 273, 281­ 286, and 302­ 312. There are no large differences in helices H and I.

846 The second metal ion is Kþ, as reported.36 However, it has seven ligands, not six, in a distorted polyhedron (Figure 1). The ligands are a phosphate, backbone carbonyls of T30 and K51, and four water molecules (numbers 551­ 554). The ligand positions are accurately determined, with 8 ­11s peaks in omitted residual Fo 2 Fc maps (Figure 1). Average coordination bond length is ° ° 2.59 A (^ 0.08 A standard deviation). Both coordination number and bond length in this structure are more consistent with Kþ than Ca2þ as in inorganic compounds,43 in which Kþ has the most common coordination number of 7 with coordination ° bond length of 2.72 A and Ca2þ has 7 with bond ° . Interestingly, a similar Kþ coordilength of 2.35 A nation was observed44,45 in Hsp70. With our new crystallographic evidence, we can now confirm that ATP is bound in the structure instead of ATPgS. We had previously built the ATP model in the structure, because we failed to identify the location of the S atom on the nucleotide.36 If S was present, it should be equally distributed among three locations on g-phosphate due to free rotation of a preceding bond. If there is a choice for coordination ligand between O and S, Mg2þ prefers O and Mn2þ prefers S. The observed ° 2.21 A coordination bond length of Mg2þ to the gphosphate group in this structure is more consist° ° ent with Mg ­ O (2.20 A) than Mg ­S (2.41 A) bond 43 lengths in inorganic compounds, which excludes the Mg coordination as a location for S. If S was distributed between the two remaining positions, or fixed in one position, one would observe an outstanding difference of four and eight electrons (next to 15-electron phosphorous), respectively, or a large difference in temperature factors. This difference is equivalent to a 10s peak in the omitted Fo 2 Fc maps, as we have observed for water molecules next to 19-electron Kþ. We did not observe such difference in either Fo 2 Fc electron density maps or temperature factors. This suggests that there is no S on the nucleotide. A perplexing issue is why ATP is observed and how it was selected into crystals, when ATPgS was included in crystallization and crystal stabilization. During storage, ATPgS could slowly hydrolyze to yield ADP. Two ADP molecules in solid phase could convert to one AMP and one ATP. As a contaminant, ATP is often present from 0.1% to 1% in commercial ATPgS, unless purified immediately before use. Under crystallization concentration of 2.5 mM ATPgS,36 the estimated 2.5 ­25 mM ATP is within the range of binding constant to GroEL.30 When GroEL is trapped in a TT state by lattice contacts (initially due to the presence of ATPgS), its affinity for ATP (also ATPgS) in crystals should be much higher than in solution. Fresh ATP from the stabilization solution could bind GroEL in crystals. We have noted that less than 5% of the crystals diffracted to very high resolution and over 95% crys° tals diffracted to around 3.0 A resolution or poorer. If the ATP-containing crystals are of among the highest quality, by selecting the best

Crystal Structure of (GroEL-KMgATP)14

crystal for data collection, we may have coincidentally chosen an ATP-containing crystal. We have recently revisited the structure of the asymmetric GroEL/GroES complex37 and determined another one. Unexpectedly, we also observed that MgATP is bound to GroEL even though ATP was never knowingly included in sample preparation and crystallization. Details of this result will be described elsewhere. We also observed on two other occasions that the bound nucleotides in crystals differ from ones included in crystallization.46,47 The stereochemistry of GroEL/KMgATP in the structure provides a structural basis for ATP hydrolysis. We propose that D52 is the general base for ATP hydrolysis because it is located ° about 4.5 A away from the gP atom (Figure 1(B)). If we place a hypothetic hydroxyl on the line connecting D52 to the gP atom with a distance of ° ° 2.8 A to D52, this hydroxyl is about 1.7 A away from the gP atom, ready for the hydrolytic attack. The observation of ATP, not its hydrolytic product ADP, in the crystal is likely due to the rebinding of ATP from fresh stabilization solution. In comparison with an unpublished structure of the GroEL/GroES/MgATP complex without Kþ, we observe in this structure that Kþ helps to fix the gPO4 group in place through three different hydrogen bonds and re-position D52, ready for ATP hydrolysis. This explains how Kþ accelerates the hydrolysis rate by at least 104-fold and why it is strictly required for ATP hydrolysis by GroEL.48 Revision to the GroEL subunit structure and domain rotational variations Revisions to the previous structure36 are mainly located at the periphery of the apical domains, including residues 178­ 186, 228 ­ 233, 241 ­246, 267 ­273, 281­ 286, 302­ 312, and 382­ 389 (Figure 2(D)). The current structure supports the previous interpretation on the orientation of helix I (Figure 2(A)), and shows a high quality electron density for the apical domains near the apical­intermediate domain interface (Figure 2(B)). The main-chain conformation in each apical domain in this structure is nearly identical to our previous structure36 with the root-mean-squares Ca coordinate differ° ence (rmsd) of 0.63 A, and is similar to the refined ° apo-structure35 with the rmsd of 1.08 A, after excluding helix I. There exist domain rotational conformational variations induced by lattice contact in the 14 independent subunits in this structure (Figure 2(C)). They are largely in the apical and intermediate domains. The rotational spread (or maximal rotation angle) of apical domains is about 7.48, when the equatorial domains of the 14 subunits are superimposed. Large lattice-induced variations in this structure are due to weak inter-domain interactions of the apical domains. The variations are slightly smaller in one ring (subunits H to N) than in the second ring (subunit A to G) by 28. Additionally, small differences in helix C and

(A) Least squares superposition using the equatorial domains for 14 independent KMgATP-bound GroEL subunits (cyan, equatorial; green, intermediate; and red, apical domain) in this study and seven apo-GroEL subunits (yellow, R state35) reveal systematic differences in orientation of the apical domain (in box). (B) A large lateral displacement of apical surface as a result of domain rotation occurring between the R and T states is shown.

strands 16 ­17 (revised numbering37,49) in equatorial domains are observed. Some additional details are provided in Materials and Methods. Domain rotations in the T to R state transition The apical and intermediate domains rotate differently upon binding of ATP. Direct pair-wise comparison between the apo-structure35 (seven subunits in T state) and this ATP-bound structure (14 subunits R state) reveals the maximal difference of about 6.38 in rotations of apical and intermediate domains in reference to the equatorial domain. However, this comparison is not very useful, because the observed domain rotations include conformational variations induced by lattice contacts. Two approaches were used to exclude such lattice-induced variations. One approach was to systematically superimpose equatorial domains for all independent subunits and the other approach was to use averaged coordinates (see Materials and Methods). When all equatorial domains were superimposed for all seven subunits in the apo state,5,35 conformational variations were apparent with spreads in apical domain rotations of 4.68 (Figure 3), which is smaller than in this structure (7.48). Because of lattice-induced variations, there is no distinct gap between the two

states (Figure 3(A)). Comparison of the two extreme representations in the two states reveals maximal possible domain rotations of 4.68 and 4.48 for the apical and intermediate domains, respectively, in reference to the equatorial domain. Comparison of the averaged coordinates in the two states shows again different rotations for the two domains (2.98 and 2.38, respectively). ATP-dependent domain rotations induce a large lateral displacement of the apical domain surface (Figure 3(B)). The average displacement is ° ° about 4.5 A with a maximum of 7.0 A. The center of the mass of the apical domain does not change ° much (1.3 ­ 1.6 A). Because the displacement is largely parallel to the 7-axis, it does not introduce ° a large increase (only 1.1 A) in the distance (about ° ) of two adjacent apical domain surfaces. 24 A However, this displacement will become a large relative motion of two domains against each other between a subunit with ATP and a subunit without it. This motion has a maximal effect for a protein substrate that is bound at their apical ­apical domain interface. Helix I rotation in the T to R state transition Apical surface helix I rotates about 1028 along its helical axis upon binding of ATP, giving rise to a

deceptive superposition (Figure 3(C) and (D)). In this structure, as well as our previous structure,36 we have unambiguously determined the orientation of this helix, because of large variation in size of side-chains (Figure 2(A)). Residual Fo 2 Fc maps do not reveal any additional error in amino acid registry in the structure. We argue that the refined apo-structure is also reliable in regard to the apical domain structure.35 Helix I is not the poorest part in that structure according to tempera° ture factors (kBl ¼ 134 A2 for all seven subunits), while a loop (residues V304-L314) is ° (kBl ¼ 140 A2). The authors show that they have unambiguously determined the structure of the loop using a novel torsion angle dynamics.35,50 Furthermore, the orientation of helix I was initially determined using original experimental maps.5 Helix I conformational variations are intrinsic to the GroEL apical domain, and have also been observed in many other occasions (Figure 3(D)), including the structures of the GroEL/GroES complex37 and isolated apical domain.51 ­ 54 These variations may provide plasticity in binding of protein substrate.52 Helix I rotation could have an implication on affinity of GroEL for the protein substrate. Rotation of the helix and re-orientation of charged residues (Figure 4(C) and (D)) at its ends have substantially reduced the hydrophobic property of the apical domain surface. In the high affinity state for the protein substrate observed in the apo-structure of

the T state,5,35 the apical domain maintains an unusual hydrophobic property of the surface. This feature resides on the concave surface and is stabilized by extensive intermediate ­ apical and apical­ apical interactions (Figure 4(D)). When these interactions are reduced upon ATP binding (Figure 4(C) and (D)), so is the hydrophobic property of the apical domain surface and so would the affinity of GroEL for the protein substrate. Therefore, our structure is consistent with biochemical data31 and provides a basis of ATPdependent regulation of the affinity of GroEL for the protein substrate. There are some limitations in the reductionist approach using the isolated apical domain to study the GroEL structure and function. This approach has pinpointed the substrate-binding site on the apical domain. However, the isolated apical domain cannot regulate its affinity for a protein substrate. Upon binding of a protein substrate, the isolated apical domain cannot sequester or release it for refolding. Finally, the orientation of helix I in the isolated apical domain structures51 ­ 54 is the same as in this ATP-bound GroEL structure, indicating that the isolated apical domain complex structure with peptides may not represent a biologically relevant substrate complex. Indirect evidence supports our structural observation on helix I, including the V263S mutation data.55,56 In the high affinity state for the protein substrate in the apo-GroEL structure,5,35 V263

Crystal Structure of (GroEL-KMgATP)14

side-chain points towards a hydrophobic core, and exposes many other hydrophobic residues on the helix. In the low affinity state in the rotated helix I structure upon ATP binding, the V263 side-chain is near the S201 side-chain, and the apical domain has substantially reduced the hydrophobic property of surface (Figure 4(D)). A rotation of helix, which is a small structural change, may not be easily detected in electron micrographs.56 When V263 is mutated to serine, modeling suggests that the V263S and S201 side-chains can form a hydrogen bond. Such interaction would permanently lock the structure at the low affinity state for protein substrate, making the enzyme incapable of binding the protein substrate.55,56 Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in ring structures As in the subunit comparison, lattice-induced variations have to be excluded in ring comparison between the R and T states of GroEL. Three approaches were used for doing so: (1) compare heptameric rings that were constructed after applying the observed 7-fold non-crystallography symmetry using subunits with the largest difference in the two states, (2) compare heptameric rings that were constructed using subunits with average coordinates, and (3) directly compare experimentally determined hepameric rings. In this study, approach (1) has provided the maximal possible structural difference, and approaches (2) and (3) have confirmed that the similar difference indeed exists, although on a smaller scale. Upon binding of ATP, the apical domains in the GroEL rings go partially free. The center of mass (CM) for the apical domain is displaced outward ° ° by 1.31 A and upward by 1.62 A with respect to the 7-fold axis (Figure 4(A) and (B)) according to the approach (1). The upward displacement weakens the interactions of apical domain with neighboring intermediate domain, and the outward displacement weakens these between adjacent apical domains. These motions free the apical domains. Interestingly, the orientation of helix I in this "free" state is identical to the truly free isolated apical domain state.51 ­ 54 However, we do not observe any significant displacement in the center of the mass of the equatorial domains or rotation around it using all three approaches, which disagree with cryo-electron microscopic data.41 Using approach (3), counter-clockwise rotations of the apical domains are clearly visible (Figure 4(B)). In this aspect, our structure agrees well with cryoelectron microscopic data.41 Upon binding of ATP, the hydrophobic property of the apical domain surface is reduced. In the apo structure,5,35 many charged residues (K207, K226, R231, K272, E216, E252, E255, and E257) are involved in inter-subunit interactions and are inter-locked at the apical ­apical domain interface (Figure 4(D)). In this structure, many of these interactions are substantially weakened,

and some of these residues now point at the center cavity, resulting in more hydrophilic nature on the apical domain surface (Figure 4(C)). Although the crystal structure of the ADP-bound GroEL after ATP hydrolysis remains unknown, it may resemble the apo state in exposing hydrophobic surfaces.57 Therefore, there is an ATP binding and hydrolysis-dependent switching of surface property. Weakened inter-subunit interactions of apical domains Upon binding of ATP, the intermediate ­apical domain interface and the apical ­ apical domain interface are partially separated between two adjacent subunits. Each apical domain interacts with two other apical and one intermediate domain of neighboring subunits in GroEL.5 The intermediate ­ apical domain interface includes both extensive hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (Figure 2(B)). Here, we use the E386 (of the intermediate domain) and R197 (of the apical domain) interaction as an example. This interaction is important, because the mutation of R197A has substantially reduced allostery.31,58 ° Upon ATP binding, there is about a 0.48 A increase in their hydrogen bond distance. The degree of increase however varies from one subunit and one ring to another, due to latticeinduced variations. In one ring (subunits A to G) in this structure, the distance is ° ° ° 3.67(^ 0.39) A, varying from 3.26 A to 4.48 A, representing weak or non-existent interactions. In the second ring (subunits H to N), it is ° ° ° 3.32(^ 0.26) A, from 3.09 A to 3.89 A. In compari° son, the distance is 3.01(^ 0.19) A in the apo representing a modest-strength structure,35 hydrogen bond. Similarly, the apical ­apical domain interface is also partially separated upon binding of ATP (Figure 4(C) and (D)). On ° average, this separation is about 1.1 A. This change weakens electrostatic interactions among a large number of charged residues (K207, K226, R231, K272, E216, E252, E255, and E257) at the interface. Molecular mechanism of domain rotations and structural basis for allostery There are two types of ATP-dependent domain rotations at two domain joints: one between the equatorial and intermediate domains and the other between the intermediate and apical domains (Figure 5). When the second type of rotation occurs, the orientation of the apical domain with respect to the equatorial domain will differ from that of the intermediate domain. The above subunit comparison shows that indeed it is the case: 2.98 and 2.38 using average coordinates or 4.68 and 4.48 using the extreme representations, respectively. If GroEL were a single-subunit molecule, we would not expect the second type of

° rotation, because the second joint is about 30 A away from the ATP binding site. The source of type II rotations is from inter-subunit communications within the assembly, and can provide the structural basis for allostery. When type II rotations facilitate type I, it is positive allostery; when type II rotations counteract type I, it is negative allostery. Therefore, this structure has suggested positive intra-ring allostery in the ATP binding process, consistent with biochemical data.4,23 Structure-based mechanism for the GroELassisted protein folding ATP-dependent displacements in the apical domain have mechanistic consequence for the unfolding of bound protein substrates. The binding of ATP causes rotations of apical domains, which in turn results in their lateral displacements up to ° 7 A. For the case of a protein substrate bound by multiple apical domains, these displacements could result in a mechanical force, which would help unfold the substrate.18,32,33,59 On the other hand, the displacements would not have this effect60 ­ 62 on a substrate bound only by one apical domain. The process of unfolding in the two cases clearly differs, and both pathways may simultaneously occur in vivo. Our structural interpretation of forced unfolding differs from a previous one,33 which was based on the structure of the GroEL-GroES/ADP complex.37 Biochemical experiments showed that forced unfolding occurs only upon ATP binding,33 but not after ATP hydrolysis when GroES is bound,63 consistent with our model. Asymmetry within a given ring is part of pathways in the structure-based mechanism of GroELassisted protein folding (Figure 6). Our new mechanism extends beyond the previous affinity-based mechanism4,23 by including hypothetical asymmetric states within each GroEL ring. In contrast to our previous structural analysis,36 this analysis shows that there are many ATP-dependent structural changes that are consistent with biochemical data. In order to incorporate the new finding of large lateral displacement of the apical domains

into the mechanism, we propose that there exist asymmetric states within each GroEL ring. The existence of an asymmetric state for the protein substrate is apparent, because GroEL does not maintain 7-fold symmetry when not binding seven identical protein substrates at once. Typically, a protein substrate may bind up to three apical domains,56 or at only one or two sites on the GroEL tetradecamer.64,65 In general, the additional affinity, provided by a second site for protein substrates, appears to be much lower than one provided by the first site.65 Such affinity regulation provides one way in which GroEL-GroES may avoid the possibility of interactions with more than one non-native protein at a time (thus further reducing chance of aggregation). However, The existence of an asymmetry state for ATP binding within one ring is less apparent, even though the binding process may occur one subunit at a time. Of course, the presence of a protein substrate can certainly establish asymmetry of ATP binding. We assume that the affinity of GroEL for ATP within this ring is also regulated by the asymmetrically bound protein substrate, i.e. low affinity for subunits with the protein substrate bound and high affinity without it.31 Once ATP is bound, our structure shows that ATP-induced domain rotations will facilitate domain rotations of neighboring subunits, known as positive intra-ring allostery.4,23 This allostery converts the low affinity neighboring subunits to high affinity, one at a time. During this process, a mechanical force could be generated for forced unfolding. In summary, our structure-based mechanism (Figure 6) emphasizes the importance of ATP-dependent structural changes in GroEL in asymmetric states. Being supported with crystal structures, the affinity-based mechanism appears to be a common theme among all ATPase chaperones. All ATPase chaperones switch between states with high and low affinity for protein substrates in an ATPdependent manner. GroEL and DnaK (also known as Hsp60 and Hsp70, respectively) are two examples of such ATPases with extensive biochemical and structural data.3 Our structure, consistent with biochemical data, prompts us to

Figure 6. Structure-based GroEL-assisted protein folding pathways. The affinity of GroEL for protein substrate at the apical domain and ATP at the equatorial is labeled as H for high and L for low; the underlined labels are asymmetric within each ring and the lowercase indicates the process of switching. Dashed and dotted arrows are minor alternative pathways. The lower pathway is for large protein substrates that cannot be encapsulated inside the GroEL/GroES cavity. The upper pathway is for small protein substrates that can be encapsulated. A minor upper pathway includes the migration of bound ATP from the trans-ring to the cis-ring, before the formation of the asymmetric GroEL/GroES complex. The formation of the GroEL/GroES complex always requires the binding of ATP in the cis-ring. ATP hydrolysis leads to the dead-end GroEL/ES asymmetric complex, which can only be disassembled by the binding of ATP in the low affinity sites of the trans-ring. The symmetric (GroES)7(GroEL)14(GroES)7 complex, which has been observed under the physiological conditions,8 ­ 11 is not included in the diagram, because it has no accessible binding sites for the protein substrates and may represent a storage form for the excess chaperonins.

further re-examine similarities and differences between the two ATPases. Both GroEL and DnaK have one high and one low affinity state for protein substrates corresponding to the ATP-bound state and ADP (or apo) state, respectively.4,23,66 In both cases, a chaperonin, DnaJ for DnaK and GroES for GroEL, facilitates ATP hydrolysis. Both are unfoldases under certain conditions.18,32,33,59,67 In DnaK, GrpE facilitates the exchange of ATP with ADP. However, no equivalent cofactor is observed for

GroEL. One possibility is that the second GroEL ring performs the equivalent function.19

Materials and Methods
Structure determination and refinement Our own experimental data with the original test set and model (without solvent molecules as a starting

852

Crystal Structure of (GroEL-KMgATP)14

model for this structure determination) were retrieved from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) database under 1DER.36 The structure of (GroEL-KMgATP)14 was refined using the program CNS68 to a free R-factor of 25.8% and the model was rebuilt using the program O.69 The refinement included about 20 runs of positional and individual atomic B-factor refinement in addition to ten test runs from which proper NCS weights were determined. There were about ten runs of the model rebuilding using model-phased sA weighted Fo 2 Fc and 2Fo 2 Fc maps. In each run, the top 100 to 500 positive peaks and top 50 to 100 negative peaks in residual Fo 2 Fc maps were visually examined. In early runs, most peaks corresponded to structural errors; in later runs they corresponded to ordered solvent molecules. Structural corrections included many side-chain conformations and some backbone flipping through the entire structure as well as a few main-chain conformations for residues at the apical ­apical domain interface. Free R-factors decreased by 0.8% per run on average with 0.2% in the last few runs. Most prominent unexplained residual Fo 2 Fc peaks in the final map were due to two conformations of Met114 side-chains and multiple conformations of several glutamate, glutamine, arginine, and valine residues. Currently, only one conformation per residue is included in the model. There were also unexplained positive peaks next to the side-chain of Val94 in all 14 subunits at the size of one additional methyl group, very suggestive of possible Val-to-Ile mutations. However, no known rotamers in combination of torsional rotations could fit these features. The final model contains 57,099 non-hydrogen atoms, including 14 KMgATP, two additional Kþ, 22 SO22, and 2541 ordered 4 water molecules (Table 1). This model contains three mutations R13G, A126V, and E434A, the first two of which were described in the previous pdb entry 1DER.36 Two other mutations A262L and I267M previously described in 1DER are now considered to be the wildtype (L262 and M267) following the update of protein database sequence. During the refinement, equatorial, intermediate, and apical domains were restrained to be three independent, structurally equivalent groups among 14 subunits. This allows free domain rotations and any deviations to the perfect D72 NCS. Energy penalty terms for position and B-factor violations to NCS equivalence were initially 300 and 2, respectively, and gradually reduced to 25 and 0.0 at the final cycle. Equatorial domains of subunits B and E were excluded in restraints when we observed that such restraints prevented the model from moving into correct locations, systematically resulting in outstanding positive and negative peaks in Fo 2 Fc residual maps at early stages of model rebuilding. Their deviations to NCS equivalence were due to lattice contact mediated by two Kþ ions. KMgATP and ordered solvent molecules were restrained only in initial stages and set free in all later stages. Coordinated water ligands to metal ions had no bond distance or bond angle restraints. Nonbonded radii for metal ions were reduced by additional ° 0.2 A at the final 100 cycles of positional refinement to ensure no bias in coordination bond length determination. B-factors were completely released from noncrystallographic symmetry restraints when large differences in quality of electron density for apical domains were observed. B factor limits were set between 10 and 100 for individual B-factor refinement in first half runs and reset between 10 and 160 for the remaining runs of

refinement. Increased B maximum reduced free R-factors by over 1.2%. Inclusion of all measured weak-intensity reflections There were 385,560 reflections in refinement and map ° ° calculation between 8 A and 2.4 A in the previous ° work.36 There are 540,791 reflections between 40 A and ° used in the current refinement, which is about 2.0 A 40% increase (Table 1). There are 615,898 reflections in the current map calculation including 143,333 measured zero-intensity reflections, which make 21% of all data and are mostly very-weak intensity reflections (Table 1). ° ° An extension from 2.4 A to 2.0 A resolution in the structure refinement has shown the importance of all measured weak reflections. Using the previous model,36 the two largest residual peaks were about 5s in the final ° Fo 2 Fc map at 2.4 A for using all data with F/sF . 2.0, which were considered to be acceptable random noises in the structure. In order to examine the importance of weak reflections in the refinement, we calculated residual maps using the previous model in the following four different resolution cut-offs: (1) data with F/sF . 2 ° ° between 8 A and 2.4 A, (2) all data including zero-inten° ° sity reflections between 8 A and 2.4 A, (3) data with F/ ° ° sF . 2 between 40 A and 2.0 A, and (4) all data includ° ° ing zero-intensity reflections between 40 A and 2.0 A. The largest feature in the residual maps was 5, 7, 18, and 20s, respectively. This feature corresponds to a bound Kþ that mediates lattice contact. Because weakintensity reflections were poorly measured, by excluding them, one produced much better-looking refinement statistics. With the previous model,36 free R-factors were 28%, 30%, 31%, and 34%, respectively, for above four resolution cut-offs. However, by excluding them, we had clearly compromised errors in the model. Measured zero-intensity reflections helped to crystallographically identify the E434A mutation. These reflections belong to a new class of test set and provide unbiased information about the model, because zerointensity reflections could not be included in the formulation of maximal likelihood refinement. During refinement, we observed negative peaks at 6.6 to 8.2s in residual Fo 2 Fc maps overlapping the entire E434 sidechains for all 14 subunits at equatorial domain where electron density was well defined. These features further increased by an additional 0.5 ­1.0s (the model had a free R-factor of 29.3% at the time) when all 143,333 zerointensity reflections were included. Only interpretation of the E434A mutation is most consistent with all features in both 2Fo 2 Fc and residual Fo 2 Fc maps. Domain motion analysis Domain rotational matrix was calculated and decomposed as described elsewhere.47 Three GroEL domains are defined as equatorial (residues 2 ­ 136 and 410­ 525), intermediate (residues 137­ 188 and 378­ 409), and apical domains (residues 189­ 377). Residue 526 was discarded in the analysis. Domain rotation results in domain translation when the rotation axis does not pass through the CM of the domain of interest. Domain translation analysis was carried out as follows. The tetradecameric GroEL35 in RR state was generated using crystallographic symmetry, and superimposed onto our TT state structure using a least squares procedure. CM for each domain for each ring was calculated whose z coordinate represents height and x, y represent the center of ring. A difference

in the two structures in z represents a translation along the 7-fold axis. An increase in length for CM to the 7fold axis within the xy plane represents a ring expansion. Conformational variations in the GroELKMgATP complex Domain motion analysis showed that the outcome of ATP-binding induced conformational changes was highly dependent on the choice of given individual subunit that was used in analysis. Incorrect choices had led to an incorrect conclusion of no observable conformational changes.36 This led us to carefully and systematically re-examine the conformational variability of GroEL in this KMgATP bound structure, and to use this information to filter variations out from the analysis. Deviations of D72 non-crystallographic symmetry of the (GroEL)14 particle were clearly observed during extensive rebuilding. These deviations were both geometric (positional) and dynamic (temperature B-factors), and were distributed throughout the entire structure. Too strongly forced NCS restraints often led to large residual Fo ­ Fc electron densities, which progressively became significant with improvement of the model. To overcome this, we gradually lowered energy penalty terms for violations of NCS, or excluded certain subunits from NCS restraints. These changes allowed us to accurately reveal domain motions in subunits. The quality of electron densities for the apical domains was highly dependent on where the domains were located in the crystal lattice. All high-density quality apical domains (subunits D, G, H, N) were involved in either inter-particle lattice contacts or intra-particle inter-subunit contacts with intermediate domains. All poor-density quality apical domains (subunits C, J, K, M) were less restricted and not involved in contacts in the lattice. The order of quality from the best to worst defined electron density in the final maps is from equatorial, intermediate to apical domains, and to apical surface helices, sequentially. Even though apical domains in general had poor quality density, some of the apical domains had well-defined electron density in which, for example, the carbonyl atoms are clearly visible (Figure 2(B)) and the structure has now been correctly determined. Packing in the lattice reveals the nature of flexibility of GroEL not only in the apical domains, but also in the equatorial domains. The C-terminal ends of helix E in the equatorial domain point to each other in B and E subunits that are related by an inter-particle pseudo-dyad in the lattice. An octahedrally coordinated metal ion (in equivalent number electrons and coordinate number of either Kþ or Caþ þ , currently arbitrarily assigned as Kþ in the model) stabilizes otherwise unfavorable helical dipole ­ dipole interactions. A second metal ion stabilizes the same interactions between subunits D and G. Binding of Kþ causes asymmetric deviations of 7-fold symmetry in equatorial domains mainly in subunits B and E, but not D and G. These deviations mainly extend to intermediate domains and in part to helix C in equatorial domains. Coordinate-averaged "typical" representations of conformational states In order to generate a typical representation of the KMgATP-bound (TT) state for 14 independent GroEL subunits in the asymmetric unit, all subunits were simul-

taneously superimposed using their equatorial domains, and then coordinates for equivalent Ca atoms were averaged. Similar procedures were applied to generate the apo-(RR) state from seven independent subunits.35,37 Figures and coordinates Figures were made using the program Midas70 for Figure 6CD and Ribbons71 for all others. Coordinates were deposited under accession 1KP8 in RCSB database as a replacement for previous 1DER.36
