C­C hydrolase MhpC (2-hydroxy-6-keto-nona-1,9-dioic acid 5,6-hydrolase) from Escherichia coli catalyses the hydrolytic C­C cleavage of the meta-ring fission product on the phenylpropionic acid catabolic pathway. The crystal structure of E. coli MhpC has revealed a number of active-site amino acid residues that may participate in catalysis. Site-directed mutants of His263, Ser110, His114, and Ser40 have been analysed using steady-state and stopped-flow kinetics. Mutants H263A, S110A and S110G show 104-fold reduced catalytic efficiency, but still retain catalytic activity for C­C cleavage. Two distinct steps are observed by stopped-flow UV/Vis spectrophotometry, corresponding to ketonisation and C­C cleavage: H263A exhibits very slow ketonisation and C­C cleavage, whereas S110A and S110G exhibit fast ketonisation, an intermediate phase, and slow C­C cleavage. H114A shows only twofold-reduced catalytic efficiency, ruling out a catalytic role, but shows a fivefold-reduced KM for the natural substrate, and an ability to process an aryl-containing substrate, implying a role for His114 in positioning of the substrate. S40A shows only twofoldreduced catalytic efficiency, but shows a very fast (500 sK1) interconversion of dienol (317 nm) to dienolate (394 nm) forms of the substrate, indicating that the enzyme accepts the dienol form of the substrate. These data imply that His263 is responsible for both ketonisation of the substrate and for deprotonation of water for C­C cleavage, a novel catalytic role in a serine hydrolase. Ser110 has an important but non-essential role in catalysis, which appears not to be to act as a nucleophile. A catalytic mechanism is proposed involving stabilisation of reactive intermediates and activation of a nucleophilic water molecule by Ser110.

Catalytic Mechanism of C­C Hydrolase MhpC

Figure 1. Reaction scheme showing nucleophilic and general base mechanisms for the MhpC-catalyzed C­C bond hydrolysis. The reaction consists of an initial ketonization to give a keto-intermediate (RFPk) and then a nucleophilic attack by an active-site nucleophile or a water molecule, leading to the C­C fragmentation to yield HPD and succinate.

enzyme-catalysed reaction proceeds with insertion of the H-5E hydrogen atom by the enzyme,3 with partial exchange of the H-5Z hydrogen atom.4 Stopped-flow kinetic studies at pH 5.0 and pH 4.0 have identified a fast initial step, corresponding to the ketonization of the substrate dienol ring fission product, 2-hydroxy-6-keto-nona-2,4-diene-1,9-dioic acid (RFP) into a keto tautomer ketonized ring fission product, 2,6-diketo-non-3-ene 1,9-dioic acid (RFPk), followed by rate-determining C­C cleavage and product release steps.5 The existence of a covalent acyl enzyme intermediate, implied by the presence of a serine catalytic triad, was investigated using a range of kinetic and trapping experiments; however, very low stoichiometries (!1%) of covalently bound acyl species were found under conditions where acyl enzyme hydrolysis should be slow.6 Evidence in favour of a mechanism involving base-catalysed attack of water has been obtained from the incorporation of 4­6% of two atoms of 18O from H18O into the product succinate; and from the 2 enzyme-catalysed exchange of 18O into a noncleavable analogue 4-keto-nona-1,9-dioic acid (KNDA).6 Studies on the related C­C hydrolase on the biphenyl degradation pathway have revealed that its structure contains the ab-hydrolase fold,7 and can process a range of substituted substrates.8 2-Hydroxy-6-keto-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid hydrolase (BphD) from Burkholderia xenoverans LB400 has recently been shown to catalyse the C­C cleavage of a reduced substrate analogue containing an alcohol at C-6 in place of a ketone, consistent with a general base mechanism, but not with a nucleophilic mechanism.9 In the accompanying paper, the structure of C­C hydrolase MhpC complexed with a non-cleavable substrate analogue is reported.10 This structure has

identified several active-site amino acid residues that may participate in catalysis, as illustrated in Figure 2. As well as the catalytic triad consisting of Ser110, His263 and Asp235, residue His114 is situated close to one end of the bound substrate, and Ser40 is situated close to the central carbonyl group. In order to elucidate the precise functions of these residues in catalysis, we have prepared a series of site-directed mutant enzymes. Here, we report the detailed analysis of these site-directed mutant enzymes using steady-state and pre-steadystate kinetic methods.

Figure 3. Partial amino acid sequence alignment of MhpC with other C­C hydrolases and ab-hydrolase enzymes. C­C hydrolases: MhpC from Escherichia coli, BphD from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, XylF from Pseudomonas putida and DmpD from Pseudomonas sp. CF600. Esterases: TPES, atropinesterase from Pseudomonas sp.; PflEST, esterase from Pseudomonas fluorescens.

noted previously, the residues of the catalytic triad (Ser110, His263, Asp235) are strictly conserved. Ser40 in the MhpC sequence is conserved in the majority of C­C hydrolases, although not in all (found as Gly in BphD sequences), and is not conserved in other ab-hydrolases. His114 is found only in the MhpC sequence, and is found as either Ala or Gly in other C­C hydrolases. Construction and expression of site-directed mutant enzymes Six site-directed mutant enzymes were prepared. Ser110 was replaced by Ala and Gly; His263, Asp235, Ser40, and His114 were each replaced by Ala. The mutant mhpC genes were each expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS, giving high levels of expression. The D235A mutant, however, formed insoluble inclusions and was detected only at low levels by SDS-PAGE in cell-free extracts. Each mutant enzyme was purified by Q Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography, giving purified enzyme (30­50 mg from 2 l of culture) of O95% homogeneity. Only small quantities of the D235A enzyme were obtained. The circular dichroism spectrum of this mutant was different from those of the other five mutants and wild-type protein, implying that it was folded incorrectly. Steady-state kinetic analysis Steady-state kinetic parameters were measured for each of the mutant enzymes, using the natural substrate, giving the data shown in Table 1. Mutants

S110A and S110G showed 5000-fold and 30,000fold-reduced kcat, respectively, compared to the wild-type enzyme, but only threefold higher KM, confirming that Ser110 plays an important role in catalysis. The residual catalytic activity in these mutants was significantly higher than background variations in A394. The formation of product 2-hydroxypentadienoic acid (HPD) was verified by monitoring the reaction at the lmax for HPD (270 nm), which gave a linear increase with time. Thus, it was established that these mutants do retain some catalytic activity for C­C cleavage, albeit greatly reduced. Mutant H263A also showed 10,000-fold-reduced kcat, but virtually the same KM as wild-type enzyme, demonstrating an important catalytic role for His263, but again retaining some activity for C­C cleavage. A kcat value for mutant D235A was estimated as 0.016 sK1 from the activity of cell extract, since the purified enzyme was misfolded and unstable, indicating approximately 1700-fold-reduced activity compared with wildtype enzyme. Mutant H114A showed sixfold reduced kcat compared with wild-type enzyme, and a 2.7-foldreduced KM, and therefore showed overall a twofold drop in catalytic efficiency. In view of the effect upon KM, and the observation that His114 is changed to Ala in C­C hydrolase BphD, the H114A mutant was assayed using the 6-phenyl-substituted ring fission product, prepared synthetically as described.9 Remarkably, the H114A mutant accepted the 6-phenyl RFP as substrate, whereas wild-type MhpC does not, giving kcat and KM values 0.036 sK1 and 23.8 mM. These observations imply that His114 is not involved in catalysis, but is involved in positioning the propionate versus phenyl side-chain of the substrate. Mutant S40A showed tenfold reduced k cat compared with wild-type enzyme and a 5.7-foldreduced KM, and therefore showed overall a twofold drop in catalytic efficiency, similar to that observed for H114A. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis Each purified mutant enzyme was analysed under single-turnover conditions by stopped-flow UV/visible spectrophotometry. Experiments were carried out at pH 7.0, whereas previous pre-steadystate kinetic analysis had been carried out at pH 5.0 and pH 4.0. Pre-steady-state analysis was first carried out on wild-type MhpC (kcat 21 sK1 at

KM and kcat were determined in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 25 8C. a kcat of D235A was an approximate value from activity of the cell extract.

244 pH 7.0), and the data simulated by curve-fitting. Monitoring substrate consumption at either 394 nm (dienolate RFP) or 317 nm (dienol RFP) gave a fast single-exponential reaction, rate constant 148 sK1 or 153 sK1, respectively. The measured rate constant did not significantly change upon varying the molar ratio of enzyme to substrate from 2 : 1 to 1 : 2. Monitoring product formation at 270 nm gave a curve that could be fit by a two-step, doubleexponential process, with rate constants 144 sK1 and 18 sK1. Therefore, two kinetic steps are seen: a fast tautomerization of RFP to RFPk, followed by rate-determining C­C cleavage and product release. Two kinetic steps had been observed at pH 5.0 and pH 4.0; however, under those conditions substrate disappearance gave a double-exponential fit, and product appearance gave a single-exponential fit. In order to explain the double-exponential fit at 270 nm, the RFPk intermediate must absorb also at 270 nm at pH 7.0, although this was not evident at pH 4.0­5.0; therefore its extinction coefficient may be pH-dependent, as is known for RFP. The first step is very pH-dependent: a much faster rate is observed at pH 7.0 (k317 153 sK1) than at pH 5.0 (k317 10 sK1), implying that base catalysis is involved in this step. Mutant S110A (kcat 3.5!10K3 sK1 at pH 7.0) showed three distinct kinetic phases for substrate disappearance at 394 nm and 317 nm under single turnover conditions, as shown in Figure 4. A rapid decrease was observed over the initial 40 ms (k394 137 sK1). Then, from 50 ms to 2 seconds, an exponential increase was observed (k394 3.0 sK1), to an amplitude of approximately 40% of the starting absorbance. Finally, from 2 seconds to 200 seconds, a slow exponential decrease was observed, whose rate (k 394Z4.0!10 K3 sK1) matched kcat. The initial fast step is assigned to the tautomerization of RFP to RFPk, which proceeds at rate similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The second step appears to correspond to an isomerization to a new ES' species not seen elsewhere. The third step corresponds to rate-determining C­C cleavage and product release. At 270 nm, a singleexponential increase was observed, with kZ17.2! 10K3 sK1. This rate is fivefold higher than kcat, implying that formation of E.HPD is faster than turnover, hence that product release is rate-determining. Very similar data were obtained for single turnover of the S110G mutant, which also showed three distinct kinetic phases. Mutant H263A (kcat 5.5!10K3 sK1 at pH 7.0) showed a slow substrate disappearance at 394 nm and 317 nm under single-turnover conditions, which could be described by a double-exponential model, with rate constants 0.3 sK1 and 0.031 sK1 at 394 nm. Product formation at 270 nm could be described by a double-exponential model, with rate constants 0.2 sK1 and 0.037 sK1. Thus, a twostep kinetic scheme is seen. The initial tautomerisation step is very slow in this mutant, being reduced 750-fold compared with wild-type MhpC. Product

Stopped-flow data were measured in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at room temperature, enzyme and substrate mixed equivalently ([E]/[S]Z1 : 1). Substrate consumption was monitored at both 394 nm and 317 nm, and product appearance was measured at 270 nm.

formation is again fivefold higher than kcat, indicating that product release is rate-determining. Mutant S40A (kcat 2.9 sK1 at pH 7.0) showed stopped-flow behaviour similar to that of the wildtype enzyme, except in the initial 20 ms, where different behaviour was observed at 317 nm and 394 nm, the only case where significant differences were observed between dienol (317 nm) and dienolate (394 nm) forms of the substrate. At 317 nm, a very fast initial decrease was observed in the first 5 ms, whereas at 394 nm an initial increase was observed in the first 5 ms, as shown in Figure 5. This difference in behaviour implies that there is a very fast (kO500 sK1) initial deprotonation of the dienol form of the bound substrate, to give the dienolate. After 20 ms, substrate disappearance can be modelled by a double-exponential process (k394 16.4 sK1 and 9.0 sK1), and product appearance by a double-exponential process (k270 19.1 sK1 and 9.7 sK1), similar to the behaviour of the wild-type enzyme. For mutant H114A (kcat 4.5 sK1 at pH 7.0), both substrate disappearance (k394 22 sK1) and product appearance (k270 20 sK1) could be modelled by single-exponential processes. These observations imply a relatively slow initial tautomerization in this mutant, followed by a faster C­C cleavage that is not observable. Since both measured rate constants are fivefold faster than kcat, it appears that product release is again rate-limiting for turnover. At longer times, a decrease was observed at 270 nm, corresponding to a fast decomposition of the product HPD (k 0.2 sK1), which normally decomposes in solution with a t1/2 of five to ten minutes.11 Therefore, it appears that this mutant has a catalytic

ability for ketonization of the product HPD dienol, which is absent from the wild-type enzyme. Analysis of pH/rate profiles for S110A and H263A mutants The pH/rate profiles for vmax were measured for wild-type MhpC, and mutants S110A and H263A, over the pH range 4.0­10.0. The rates of disappearance of RFP were measured at 317 nm for pH 4.0­7.0, and at 394 nm for pH 7.0­10.0, and enzyme activity was calculated using pre-determined extinction coefficients at each pH value (Figure 6). For wild-type MhpC, activity was fairly constant over the pH range 6.0­9.5, but activity decreased at pH !6.0 and pH O9.5, with inflexions at pH 6.2 and pH 9.6. These data imply a dependence of vmax upon a catalytic base of pKa 6.2, and a proton donor of pKa 9.6. Mutant S110A showed an upwardly sloping profile, which still showed small inflexions at pH 6.2 and pH 9.6. The presence of inflexions at similar positions implies the participation of the same acid­base groups; however, the upward slope suggests the involvement of some specific base catalysis in this mutant. Mutant H263A gave an upwardly sloping profile, with only a very slight inflexion near pH 6.0. This profile indicates specific base catalysis by solvent OHK in H263A, and is therefore consistent with His263 acting as the catalytic base. Esterase activity in WT and mutant enzymes The ability of MhpC to catalyse ester hydrolysis was examined using mono-ethyl succinate and

The concentration of RFP was 30.2 mM and that of the S40A mutant was 30.5 mM. The deduced rate constants and amplitudes for the reaction after the first 20 ms are shown in Table 2, while the initial increase at 394 nm and decrease in 317 nm in absorbance were too fast to be fit by single, double or treble-exponential kinetic models.

Discussion
The structure of C­C hydrolase MhpC, reported in the accompanying paper, has identified several active-site residues that may participate in catalysis.10 The steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of site-directed mutants described here has provided considerable insight into the roles of each amino acid in catalysis, especially in the fast tautomerization step, which is observable only under pre-steady-state conditions. Ser110, His263 and Asp235 comprise the catalytic triad, which is generally assumed to mediate nucleophilic catalysis in the ab-hydrolase family. However, as explained in Introduction, several experimental approaches to the investigation of C­C hydrolase MhpC have failed to support a nucleophilic mechanism, and instead support a

mono-ethyl adipate as substrates, by coupling of ethanol release to alcohol dehydrogenase-catalysed oxidation. No hydrolysis was observed using mono-ethyl succinate; however, turnover of mono-ethyl adipate was observed at a rate of 3.3!10K3 mmol minK1 (mg protein)K1, as shown in Figure 7(a). Thus, MhpC does possess esterase activity for a six-carbon monoester, but not a fourcarbon mono-ester, implying that C1­C6 of the natural substrate are probably bound between Arg188 and Ser110, rather than C6­C9. The two esterase substrates were tested with the S110A and H263A mutant enzymes, but no turnover could be detected for either enzyme (see Figure 7(b)).

Catalytic Mechanism of C­C Hydrolase MhpC

247 analysis of stopped-flow kinetic data for S110A. The first phase of the reaction (substrate tautomerization) is nearly as fast as with wild-type enzyme, indicating that Ser110 is not at all involved in ketonization of the substrate. There is a new, additional second phase observed in the S110A mutant, which appears to re-form a modified ES' intermediate. Our interpretation is that in this mutant the RFPk intermediate is free to rotate in the active site, and form a new conformation that can re-enolise to form a different isomer of the substrate, probably containing a Z alkene. The rate of C­C cleavage is reduced dramatically, implying a role in the formation of the gem-diolate intermediate, and in transition state stabilisation. Serine residues are able to participate in hydrogen bonding as donors or acceptors, and are implicated in acid­base catalysis in enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase 13 and UDPgalactose 4-epimerase.14 Replacement of His263 by Ala also leads to a 104-fold drop in kcat, with no change in KM, implying an important role in catalysis, but not in substrate binding. The catalytic base of pKa 6.2 implicated in the pH/rate profile of wild-type enzyme appears to be His263, since replacement of His114 by Ala gives little change in enzyme activity. Furthermore, the inflexion at pH 6.2 is absent from the pH/rate profile of the H263A mutant. Under single-turnover conditions, the H263A mutant shows a 500-fold slower initial step, indicating that His263 is required for substrate ketonization. Since there is no other acid­base ° residue (apart from His114) within 8 A of the bound substrate, the logical conclusion is that His263 is responsible for substrate deprotonation at C-2, re-protonation at C-5, and deprotonation of the catalytic water molecule. Replacement of Ser40 and His114 by Ala leads in each case to only twofold reduction in kcat/KM, implying that these residues do not have a major catalytic role, consistent with the observation that they are not conserved completely in the C­C hydrolase family (Figure 3). However, it is noteworthy that in each case a three- to fourfold reduction in KM is observed in the mutated enzyme. We have previously commented that the displacement of the keto­enol equilibrium at the MhpC active site, and the high apparent Kd, suggests that MhpC binds the dienol substrate in a strained, nonplanar conformation.5 One explanation of the above effect would therefore be that in these mutants the enzyme destabilises the bound substrate to a lesser extent, and hence binds the substrate more tightly, but has a lower kcat. The observation that the H114A mutant is able to process the phenyl-substituted substrate implies that His114 interacts in some way with the substrate side-chain, and hence restricts the binding of the larger phenyl substituent. Finally, the observation of a very fast dienol-to-dienolate transition in the first 2 ms of the S40A mutant implies that the enzyme binds the substrate in the

general base mechanism. The arrangement of His263 and Ser110 in the structure of MhpC complexed with the non-cleavable analogue 2,6diketo-nona-1,9-dioic acid (DKNDA), in which the His and Ser side-chains straddle the bound substrate analogue, is also consistent with a general base mechanism. Replacement of Ser110 by Ala or Gly gives mutant enzymes that possess 104-fold lower kcat, but similar KM, implying an important role for Ser110 in catalysis, but not in substrate binding. Some residual catalytic activity is obtained in these mutants, indicating that Ser110 is not absolutely essential for activity. The drop in catalytic efficiency in S110A, compared with wild-type enzyme, implies a free energy change of 23.2 kJ molK1 contributed by Ser110 in the catalytic mechanism. Replacement of the nucleophilic serine residue in serine proteases such as subtilisin leads to a 106-fold loss in catalytic efficiency, by comparison.12 Some insight into the role of Ser110 is revealed by the

Figure 8. Proposal for the catalytic mechanism of MhpC. The substrate is bound as the dienol form and deprotonated initially by His263. After a fast ketonization step, the C-6 ketone is twisted towards Ser110 and positioned for the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic water molecule, which is deprotonated by His263 and positioned by Ser110 through a strong hydrogen bond.

dienol form, and that the catalytic cycle is initiated by substrate deprotonation. Interpretation of the kinetic data as discussed here, together with a consideration of the structure of the active site, and stereo-electronic factors, allow us to propose a more detailed catalytic mechanism, shown in Figure 8. The observation of esterase activity using a six-carbon substrate, but not with a four-carbon substrate, implies that C-1 of the substrate is bound by Arg188, and C-6 is positioned in the vicinity of Ser110. The substrate binds perpendicular to the His-Ser pair, with His263 and Ser110 positioned above the bound substrate. The substrate is bound as the dienol form, and is deprotonated initially by His263, thus the bound substrate should be oriented with the C-2 hydroxyl group pointing upwards. Ser110 is not involved in substrate binding, nor ketonisation, but does interact with RFPk. Therefore, we propose that, upon ketonisation, the C-6 ketone twists towards Ser110, bringing C-5, the site of protonation of the dienolate, closer to His263. The C-6 ketone is then positioned suitably for attack of the catalytic water ¨ molecule at the Burgi­Dunitz angle (1098 relative to C­O bond). The catalytic water molecule is deprotonated by His263, and may be positioned by Ser110. Molecular mechanics simulations of the deacylation step of acyl a-chymotrypsin have concluded that the catalytic water molecule forms

a hydrogen bond with b-oxygen atom of the catalytic Ser195.15 The presence of a hydrogenbonding network around Ser110 could explain the additional electron density observed in ligand-free crystals of MhpC. Ser110 reduces the activation energy for C­C cleavage by at least 23 kJ molK1, implying a key role in transition-state stabilisation. We propose that Ser110 forms a strong hydrogen bond with the tetrahedral gem-diolate intermediate, perhaps acting as both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor for a cyclic hydrogen bond network, as shown in Figure 8. Hydrogen bonding to phosphinate analogues of oxyanion intermediates in antibodycatalysed ester hydrolysis reactions has been observed in several cases, from donors such as tyrosine and serine.16 The scissile C­C bond should be positioned parallel with the C]C p bond, a condition satisfied by the conformation formed after twisting of the C-6 ketone towards Ser110. This mechanism accounts for the stereochemical course of the reaction, which is insertion of H-5E of the product HPD.3,4 This outcome would be accomplished by protonation at the C-5 proS position (on the top face of the bound substrate), and fragmentation onto the re face of the 3,4-alkene, as shown in Figure 8. Product release appears to be rate-limiting in several mutant enzymes, and partly rate-limiting in the wild-type enzyme,5 which may

the six mutant enzymes were conducted according to the following procedure: The cells were grown in 1 l of LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml of ampicillin at 37 8C. Overexpression of mhpC was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at an A600 of 0.6, and grown for a further 3.5 hours. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for ten minutes at 5000g and resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 700 ml/l b-mercaptoethanol). Cell lysis was conducted by sonication, followed by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 27,000g. Powdered ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 25% saturation (144 g/l), the suspension stirred for one hour, and then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 27,000g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A, dialyzed against 4 l of buffer A at 4 8C overnight and then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (Sigma, 1.5 cm!20 cm) with a flow-rate of 1 ml/minute. The column was eluted with 200 ml buffer of A and a 0­0.5 M NaCl gradient was applied. MhpC activity was eluted at 0.15 M NaCl and the fractions were pooled. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method with Bio-Rad dye reagent and bovine serum albumin as standard.19 Enzyme purity was analyzed on SDS/15% polyacrylamide gels. Steady-state enzyme assays Activity of purified wild-type MhpC and the mutants was assayed by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 394 nm due to the consumption of the RFP (3Z15,600 MK1 cmK1 at pH 8.0), on a Cary 1 UV/Vis spectrophotometer at 25 8C. A typical assay mixture contained 0.1­0.2 mM RFP in 1 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), to which 10 ml of enzyme was added. Exact substrate concentration was calibrated with known 3394 for RFP. KM determinations were carried out using 0.5­50 mM RFP. Repeated assays of weakly active mutants (S110A, H263A and S110G) were also conducted with 96-well microplates on a GENios fluorometer (TECAN) at 400 nm (3Z6700 MK1 cmK1 at pH 8.0). Each sample on the plate consisted of 0.1­0.2 mM RFP in 200 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and 10 ml of enzyme was added at the beginning of the assay. Steady-state kinetic parameters were calculated using a Lineweaver­Burk plot. Pre-steady-state kinetic assays

be due to the movement of a "flap" covering the active site. The involvement of Ser110 as a non-nucleophilic catalytic residue and the involvement of His263 in keto­enol tautomerization are both distinctive features of this catalytic mechanism, not found in the majority of serine hydrolases. These observations suggest that the serine catalytic triad is capable of a more diverse range of chemistry than previously thought, which might explain the diverse catalytic activities observed recently in the ab-hydrolase family.

Materials and Methods
Materials E. coli strain DH5a/pIPC was a gift from Dr J. L. Garcia (CSIC, Madrid). The ring fission product (RFP) was prepared enzymatically from 2,3-dihydroxy-phenyl propionic acid (DHP) as described.4 DHP was synthesized from 2,3-dimethoxy-cinnamic acid (Sigma) following the procedure developed by Blakley & Simpson.17 Bio-Rad dye reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. IPTG was purchased from Melford Laboratories, Ltd. Other chemicals and biochemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Construction of site-directed mutants Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished according to the Quikchange XLe (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis protocol with slight modifications. Mutational codons were generally chosen to limit the number of bases changed. Oligonucleotides were customsynthesised and purified by Eurogentec Ltd (Romsey, UK) and are shown in Table 3. The same company carried out sequencing of the resultant mutant plasmids to verify that the mutation had been successful. Mutants were verified also by carrying out positive electrospray mass spectrometry on purified protein samples using a Micromass LCT (orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight) mass spectrometer with a nano-electrospray source. Enzyme purification The resulting plasmids from site-directed mutagenesis were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as described.18 Purification of MhpC wild-type and each

The assays on wild-type MhpC and the variants S110A, S110G, H263A, S40A and H114A were carried out on DX.17MV stopped-flow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd). The enzymes and RFP were dissolved in

50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Enzyme concentrations were determined by Bradford assay and calculated using a molecular mass of 29 kDa. RFP concentrations were measured in a standard cuvette at pH 8.0 using the known 3394 value (15,600 MK1 cmK1). In each single stopped-flow experiment, solutions of enzyme (1 mg/ml) and 33 mM substrate ([E]/[S]Z1 : 1 molar ratio) were mixed rapidly in the reaction chamber at room temperature. Disappearance of substrate was monitored at both 394 nm and 317 nm, while the appearance of product was monitored at 270 nm. Data for every single shot were recorded and simulated by an Acorn A5000 computer supplied with the operating system RISC OS 3, which fit the data to single, double or treble-exponential kinetic models and provided the best-fit rate constants and amplitudes as results. pH/activity profiles for wild-type MhpC, S110A and H263A A range of constant ionic strength buffers were prepared in the following pH ranges at intervals of 0.2 pH unit: sodium citrate/citric acid (pH 4.0­6.0), potassium phosphate (pH 5.8­8.4), glycine/NaOH (pH 8.4­10.0). The pH-dependent extinction coefficients of RFP were determined from Absorbance-[RFP] working curves at each pH at 25 8C (data not shown). The enzymes were assayed by monitoring the decrease in absorbance of RFP at 317 nm (for pH 4.0­7.0) and 394 nm (for pH 7.0­ 10.0) using a Cary 1 UV/Vis continuous spectrophotometer. Esterase activity assays Esterase activity assays for wild-type MhpC, S110A and H263A were performed using monoethyl adipate and monoethyl succinate as substrate at 25 8C. A typical assay consisted of 10 mM adipate (or succinate), 1.5 mM NADC and 18 units of alcohol dehydrogenase dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), to which 20 ml of MhpC (or mutant) was added at the beginning of the assay. The resulting NADH was monitored at 340 nm. A control reaction (without MhpC) was carried out.
