Metallo--lactamases (MLs) are bacterial Zn(II)-dependent hydrolases that confer broad-spectrum resistance to -lactam antibiotics. These enzymes can be subdivided into three subclasses (B1, B2 and B3) that differ in their metal binding sites and their characteristic tertiary structure. To date there are no clinically useful pan-ML inhibitors available, mainly due to the unawareness of key catalytic features common to all ML brands. Here we have designed, expressed and characterized two double mutants of BcII, a di-Zn(II) B1-ML from Bacillus cereus, namely BcII-R121H/C221D (BcIIHD) and BcII-R121H/C221S (BcII-HS). These mutants display modified environments at the so-called Zn2 site or DCH site, reproducing the metal coordination environments of structurally related metallohydrolases. Through a combination of structural and functional studies, we found that BcII-HD is an impaired -lactamase even as a di-Zn(II) enzyme, whereas BcII-HS exhibits the ability to exist as mono or di-Zn(II) species in solution, with different catalytic performances. We show that these effects result from an altered position of Zn2, which is incapable of providing a productive interaction with the substrate -lactam ring. These results indicate that the position of Zn2 is essential for a productive substrate binding and hydrolysis.

Keywords: antibiotic resistance; metallo--lactamases; Zn2 site; mutants; catalytic mechanism attack on the carbonyl group of the -lactam ring, and scission of the C­N bond (Figure 1).4 In SLs, an activated Ser residue is the nucleophile, and the reaction proceeds through formation of a covalent, tetrahedral intermediate.5 The elucidation of this mechanism has provided inspiration for the design of a series of suicide inhibitors that act by forming a covalent adduct with the enzyme, some of them being widely prescribed together with a -lactam compound to avoid hydrolysis.6 More recently, there has been growing concern for the increasing appearance of MLs in clinical settings, providing resistance to most clinically employed -lactam antibiotics.7­10 MLs are zinc-dependent hydrolases that are unaffected by clinically useful inhibitors of the serine-active enzymes.11 Despite catalyzing the same reaction, SLs and MLs do not

Introduction
-Lactamases stand as the main resistance mechanism against the bacteriolytic effect of lactam antibiotics, rendering them inactive by hydrolyzing their cyclic four-membered ring.1­3 They can be broadly divided into serine--lactamases (SLs) and metallo--lactamases (MLs), based on their active sites and catalytic mechanisms. -lactam hydrolysis includes two steps: nucleophilic

share any structural nor mechanistic similarity. In addition, MLs hydrolyze all clinically useful -lactam antibiotics. The plasmid-borne nature of most known MLs enables a large amount of horizontal gene transfer among pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria, rendering them a serious clinical problem.9 Many mechanistic details of ML-driven catalysis are still obscure. MLs share an / sandwich fold characteristic of a large protein superfamily, that includes other metalloenzymes.7,12,13 Within this fold, MLs display a substantial sequence and structural diversity. Thus, MLs have been grouped into subclasses B1, B2 and B3 based on primary sequence homology (Figure 2).14,15 B1 and B3 MLs can bind up to two Zn(II) ions,13,16­20 and are able to hydrolyze a wide range of antibiotics such as penicillins, cefalosporins and carbapenems. In contrast, B2 enzymes are mono-Zn(II) enzymes that have evolved specificity toward carbapenems.21­24 The different metal ion stoichiometries in MLs from different subclasses are due to differences in their active site structures. All B1 enzymes have a Zn(II) ion bound to His116, His118 and His196 (3H

or Zn1 site); and a second Zn(II) ion coordinated to Asp120, Cys221 and His263 (DCH or Zn2 site) (Figure 3(a) and (b)).13,16,17,20 B2 enzymes differ in the presence of an Asn residue in position 116 instead of a His, thus being able to bind a single Zn (II) ion to the DCH site (Figure 3(c)).21 B3 enzymes are somewhat divergent: while retaining the 3Hsite, the presence of a His residue in position 121 and the C221S substitution affect the Zn2 site which is bound to Asp120, His121 and His263 (DHH site) (Figure 3(d)).18,19 The structural diversity within MLs has made it difficult to find common mechanistic elements among them and, therefore, the successful design of a general ML inhibitor. The role of each metal ion in the different subclasses is also a matter of debate. There is a general consensus that a hydroxide bound to Zn1 (3H site) acts as the nucleophile in the first step of the reaction in B1 and B3 enzymes.7,25,26 Here, the role of Zn2 (with either the DCH or DHH ligand set) remains unclear.21,26­29 This has been further complicated by the finding that B2 enzymes and GOB enzymes30 (an exception within B3 lactamases) are fully active as mono-Zn2

enzymes. The identity of the nucleophile is still undefined in these cases.28 B3 lactamases are phylogenetically closer to other members of the superfamily devoid of -lactamase activity, such as glyoxalase II, Zn(II)-dependent phosphodiesterase, acyl-homoserine-lactone lactonase, methylparathion hydrolase, phosphorylcholine esterase and alkylsulfatase (Figure 2).12,31­33 These proteins are dinuclear Zn(II) or Fe(II)-dependent hydrolases. They possess a metal ligand set that in most cases is similar to that of B3 MLs, with the addition of Asp221 that behaves as a bridging ligand between the two metal ions (Figure 3(e)).12,31­33 Interestingly, MLs do not present any protein residue acting as bridging ligand in the dinuclear enzymes. From a structural point of view, it is not yet clear which are the minimal structural features that provide -lactamase activity within this protein scaffold. An important step ahead in this direction is the recent report of a combined rational protein engineering and directed evolution approach that allowed Park and co-workers to generate ML activity on glyoxalase II.34 Since the Zn1 site is mostly conserved, we decided to explore the adaptability of the Zn2 site to different ligand sets. The Zn2 site has been interrogated by site-directed mutagenesis of the different Zn2 ligands in enzymes from the three subclasses.24,35­40 So far, these studies have been targeted to explore the role and essentiality of each metal ligand. Here, we explore the adaptability of the protein framework of an ML to bind metal ions in a modified Zn2 environment, inspired by the structural diversity witnessed in this enzyme superfamily. With this purpose, we have designed, expressed and characterized two double mutants of the ML from Bacillus cereus, BcII (subclass B1) confined to the Zn2 site, with the aim of engineering the ligand sets present in B3 lactamases and in other members of the superfamily. We have studied the -lactamase activity of these mutants with different metal contents, and elucidated the structure of the engineered sites by X-ray crystallography and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Here we show that BcII is able to accommodate these engineered metal sites, with sensibly impaired hydrolytic capabilities, which we attribute to the distorted position

of Zn2, making it incapable of providing a productive interaction with the substrate. These results confirm that the Zn2 site is essential for an appropriate ML activity, and clearly demonstrate that the position of this metal ion defines a catalytically active enzyme.

Results
-Lactamase activity and metal content of the mutants We obtained two double mutants of the ML from B. cereus, BcII. Mutant BcII-HS (BcII-R121H/C221S) mimics the first-shell ligands proper of B3 MLs thereby generating a DHH ligand set at the Zn2 site of BcII (Figure 3(d)). Mutant BcII-HD (BcII-R121H/ C221D) holds a B3-like His121 residue and an Asp221 residue, in order to engineer in BcII a Zn2 site characteristic of a non--lactamase member of the ML superfamily (Figure 3(e)). The mutant plasmids were constructed from the single mutants as described in the Materials and Methods. The mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS' as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST), and were purified to homogeneity. Both BcII-HS and BcII-HD were properly folded, as revealed by the CD spectra that were similar to those of wild-type BcII. The hydrolytic profiles of the mutants BcII-HD and BcII-HS against representative -lactam antibiotics are summarized in Table 1. The effect of the Zn(II) content on catalysis was studied by exploring different Zn(II)/enzyme ratios, up to three added Zn(II) equivalents (see Materials and Methods). Both mutants showed impaired activity compared to wild-type BcII, with markedly decreased catalytic constants (kcat). Catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) exhibited the general trend BcIIN BcII-HSN BcII-HD for all assayed Zn(II) contents, the highest performances being associated with low KM values. Both mutants showed a significant dependence of their activity on the Zn(II) content. The catalytic efficiency of both mutants increased when going from one to two equivalents for all substrates tested. In the case of BcII-HS, kcat increased from five-to 100-

Mono-Zn(II) enzymes were obtained as described in Materials and Methods. The reaction medium was 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.2 M NaCl at 30 °C, with the Zn(II) contents as specified in the Table. All parameters are rounded to three digits. Standard errors are below 10%. a The Zn(II) content was confirmed by the PAR method after equilibrium dialysis. b The substrates are: cefaloridine (CLD), imipenem (IMI), cefotaxime (CTX), benzylpenicillin (PEN) and nitrocefin (NTR). c Reaction medium for mono-Zn(II) enzymes is Zn(II)-free 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.2 M NaCl (stock buffer) at 30 °C. d Not determined. kcat/KM values obtained as exponential decay constants of reaction time-courses assuming first-order kinetics. e Reaction medium for di-Zn(II) enzymes is stock buffer with the addition of Zn(II) sulfate to reach a final concentration of 80 M Zn(II) for di-Zn(II) BcII-HS and 10 M Zn(II) for di-Zn(II) BcII-HD. f Activity of BcII-HD with three Zn(II) equivalents was measured in the presence of 100 M Zn(II).

fold when going from the mono to the di-Zn(II) form, while the effect of a second Zn(II) on BcII-HD only elicited two-to eightfold larger activities. Conversely, KM values did not show uniform changes as a function of Zn(II) content and substrate type. On average, the order of magnitude of KM values for the mutants matched those of wild-type BcII. The major differences were found for cefotaxime and nitrocefin, where BcII-HS exhibited KM values 100-fold lower than BcII-HD, almost paralleling those of wild-type BcII. Addition of a third Zn(II) equivalent to the reaction milieu did not affect the activity of BcIIHS, while in BcII-HD this induced different effects that did not follow a general trend. BcII-HD with excess Zn(II) showed improved catalytic efficiencies against the cephalosporins nitrocefin and cefotaxime, due to a rise of kcat and a reduction of KM, respectively. In contrast, diminished efficiencies were observed against cefaloridine, benzylpenicillin and imipenem, mostly due to large increases of KM. In other words, the effect of excess Zn(II) on BcII-HD results in increased or decreased activities of the diZn(II) form depending on the substrate, through direct effects on substrate binding. We followed the effect of the Zn(II) content on the nitrocefinase activity of both double mutants through a more detailed, stepwise titration. Both apo proteins were reconstituted with increasing Zn(II) concentrations and, concurrently, the amount of protein-bound Zn(II) and the nitrocefinase activity at 25 °C were assessed. Since BcII-HS is a good nitrocefinase, complete hydrolysis time-courses

were attainable, allowing us to obtain kcat/KM values as simple exponential decay constants at low substrate concentrations. In contrast, since BcIIHD performs deficiently with this substrate, we estimated its -lactamase activity as the initial rate of hydrolysis of 200 M nitrocefin, normalized by the enzyme concentration in the reaction milieu. Hence, the initial rate profile obtained for this mutant is directly related to kcat. Both mutants showed sigmoidal Zn(II) activation curves with negligible activity at Zn(II)/enzyme ratios (Zn(II) equivalents) less than 1 (Figure 4). Maximal nitrocefinase activity is observed at the highest amount of bound Zn(II), two and three Zn(II) ions per molecule, for BcII-HS and BcII-HD, respectively. The Zn(II) content of BcII-HS increased at an almost constant rate up to one equivalent of Zn(II), and then slowly tapered to two Zn(II) ions per molecule, suggesting a lower affinity for the second Zn(II) equivalent (Figure 4(a)). In contrast, the Zn(II) content of BcII-HD increased at a constant rate up to two Zn(II) ions per molecule, gradually reaching a plateau at three Zn(II) ions per molecule (Figure 4(b)). In order to obtain estimates of the metal dissociation constants, these data were fitted with DynaFit.54 Since the dissociation constant for the first Zn(II) equivalent cannot be properly determined under these conditions, we assumed a value of 0.1 nM.41 The K2 value for BcII-HS was found to be in the micromolar range (18.3( ± 12.9) M), while the corresponding value for BcII-HD resulted to be in the same range of K1 (b 0.2 nM). These values

are in good agreement with the Zn(II) binding mode of both mutants, i.e. sequential filling for BcII-HS and simultaneous filling for BcII-HD. Finally, the K3 value for BcII-HD was 158( ± 33.7) M, which is in line with the excess Zn(II) needed

to notice the effect of the third Zn(II) equivalent on BcII-HD. These results provide a clear picture of the Zn(II) activation mode. First of all, both enzymes perform poorly in the presence of one Zn(II) equivalent.

1146 Furthermore, the corresponding rise in activity upon Zn(II) uptake indicate that both mutants are sensitive to the Zn(II) content, thus restraining the appropriate Zn(II) concentration for determinations of kinetic parameters. Nevertheless, we should stress that the effect of a second Zn(II) ion is markedly different in both mutants: while BcII-HD is a poorly active -lactamase in all assayed conditions, the activity of BcII-HS was, on average, improved 102­103 fold by the uptake of a second Zn(II) ion. Indeed, reasonable kcat/KM values for di-Zn(II) BcII-HS are observed for cephalosporins. Crystal structures of the mutants BcII crystals are usually grown at low pH.16,42 Given the strong dependence of the enzymatic activity on the metal content, and the tendency of Zn(II) to dissociate from BcII at acidic pH,29,42 crystals were soaked at neutral pH in order to maximize the metal occupancy. In this way, we were able to obtain crystals of both mutants, which allowed us to obtain structures for mono-Zn(II) BcII-HS, mono-Zn(II) BcII-HD and di-Zn(II) BcII-HD. The overall fold of wild-type BcII was not altered by the mutations. Mutants exhibit an average RMSD value of 0.54( ± 0.08) Å for backbone atoms of with respect to BcII. The mobile flap region (residues Gly32 to Val38; BcII numbering) displays low electron density and remains unresolved, as occurs for P3121 crystals of BcII.16 Remarkably, the loop holding residues 116 to 121 is sensitive to the metal occupancy at the Zn2 site. The BcII-HD mutant rendered space group C2 crystals both in zinc-free and zinc-supplemented conditions, containing one polypeptide chain per asymmetric unit (Table 2). The model obtained from

Altering the Zn2 Position in Metallo--Lactamases

crystals grown without added Zn(II), at pH 4.9, was refined to 2.29 Å and displays only one wild-type like Zn1 site (Figure 5(a)). The model obtained from crystals grown at pH 7 and 20 mM Zn(II) was refined to 1.84 Å. The metal-binding site displays two Zn(II) ions located at the canonical Zn1 and Zn2 sites (Figure 5(b)). Notably, the Zn2 ion exhibits a temperature factor of 42.93 Å2, almost doubling that of Zn1 (22.81 Å2), suggesting some static disorder at Zn2. Key inter-atomic distances and angles are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Mono-Zn(II) BcII-HD exhibits a single Zn(II) ion located at the 3H or Zn1 site (i.e. His116, His118 and His196). Zn1 exhibits a tetrahedral geometry, resembling the Zn1 site of mono-Zn(II)-BcII (pdb file 1bmc). The closest solvent molecule (WAT2) could be located at 4.07 Å from Zn1, i.e. beyond any reasonable bond length, but in the expected axis of the fourth ligand of a distorted tetrahedron. The low temperature factor of WAT2 (18.30 Å2) allowed us to discard the presence of a low occupancy Zn(II) ion at this location. Instead, the Zn1 site of di-Zn(II) BcII-HD is analogous to that of wild-type BcII on C2 crystals (pdb file 1bvt), exhibiting a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, coordinated to three His residues and two solvent molecules (WAT1 and WAT2; Figure 5(b)). In contrast, the Zn2 site is markedly altered compared to wild-type BcII, since both engineered residues act as metal ligands and define the position of this metal ion. The Zn2 site is located 0.90 Å from the position refined as WAT2 for the mono-Zn(II) variant. The His121 residue drags Zn2 deeper into the protein, making it less solvent-accessible and increasing the Zn1­Zn2 distance from 3.82 Å in wild-type BcII to 4.73 Å. Remarkably, the His121

side-chain displays the same orientation in both mono- and di-Zn(II) forms, suggesting that this residue provides a rigid, more buried anchoring site for Zn2. The engineered Asp221 also binds Zn2, resulting in a tighter ligand set that disfavors coordination to His263, whose N2 atom is 3.23 Å away. Two water molecules (WAT2 and WAT3) com-

C2 crystals grew at pH 4.9 without Zn(II) added to the crystallization milieu, while P3121 crystals were soaked in 20 mM Zn(II)

1148 at pH 7. The P3121 atomic model, refined to 1.80 Å, shows an asymmetric unit containing two polypeptide chains (A and B) harboring one Zn(II) ion at the 3H site, with a trigonal-bipyramidal geometry (Figure 6). In addition, a sulfate anion (SO4) was found interacting with the side-chains of Ser221, Lys224 and His263. The C2 model, refined to 2.28 Å, displays one polypeptide chain per unit cell, harboring a single Zn(II) ion at the 3H site with a tetrahedral geometry, with a solvent molecule (WAT2) located at 3.30 Å, close to the Zn2 site (Figure 6(c)). Neither structure of BcII-HS exhibited a second Zn (II) ion bound, despite soaking of P3121 crystals in excess Zn(II) at pH 7, indicative of a lower Zn(II) affinity at the Zn2 site of BcII-HS compared to wildtype BcII and BcII-HD. The P3121 structure shows that, with the Zn2 site vacant, the Asp120 side-chain participates in the second coordination sphere of Zn1 by means of WAT2 (chains A and B), while an additional solvent molecule (WAT3) interacts with O1@D120 and the SO4 group in chain. The His263 side-chain from chain A could be refined by assuming two possible conformations, as reported for several mono-Zn(II) variants of BcII (cf. mono-Zn(II) BcII-C221S, pdb 1dxk, and mono-Zn(II) BcII, pdb 1bmc), that have been defined as "in" and "out", revealing a conformational flexibility of this residue when Zn2 is not present.42 The SO4 anion is within H-bonding distance of the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring of this residue in both conformations (with N2@H263 and N1@H263 at 2.38 Å and 2.74 Å, respectively). In the C2 space group structure, His263 side-chain adopts only the in conformation: in this case, since the SO4 group is absent, it is within H-bonding distance (3.50 Å), of the WAT2 molecule located in the Zn2 site. Notably, the

His121 side-chain adopts the same orientation (towards the Zn2 site) in the P3121 and C2 structures of BcII-HS, as also observed for mono-Zn(II) BcII-HD. EXAFS spectroscopy All attempts to obtain a dinuclear Zn(II) site in the crystals of the double mutant BcII-HS were unsuccessful. Given the activity enhancement induced by binding of a second Zn(II) equivalent in BcII-HS, we decided to perform a spectroscopic study in solution of both mutants with two bound Zn(II) ions in order to gain information about the second metal binding site. The Zn(II) is a d10 metal ion, thus being silent to most spectroscopic techniques, except X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra of BcII-HS and BcII-HD recorded in the presence of two Zn(II) equivalents are shown in Figure 7, along with the best fits, and the curve-fitting results are summarized in Table 4 (a complete set of curve fits is included as Supplementary Data). The best-fit environment for di-Zn(II) BcII-HD is comprised of an average of 5( ± 1) N/O donors per Zn at 2.05 Å, with an average of 2( ± 0.5) His residues per Zn. The fit does not improve with inclusion of a binding sulfur atom, allowing us to discard the possibility of a Cys ligand to either Zn. Beyond the first shell and the histidine multiple-scattering, inclusion of a Zn1­ Zn2 distance of 3.73 Å leads to a remarkable 60% reduction in fit residual. The best-fit zinc coordination environment for BcII-HS also displays an average of 5( ± 1) N/O ligands at 2.05 Å. The data are well modeled with inclusion of 2.5( ± 0.5) His ligands per Zn, and the best fit also includes one carboxylate C atom at 2.50 Å and a Zn­Zn interaction at 3.42 Å. BcII-HS

1149 quired additional Zn(II) to reach their maximal catalytic efficiency. However, while BcII-HD showed a poor lactamase activity at all assayed Zn(II) conditions, BcII-HS increased its catalytic efficiency by one-to-two orders of magnitude upon binding of a second Zn(II) equivalent. This phenomenon was more evident toward cephalosporins. The titration curves for nitrocefinase activity as a function of Zn(II) concentration, clearly show that this mutant displays distinct catalytic behaviors in the monoand di-Zn(II) forms. Thus, the Zn(II) activation profiles give support to a sequential filling of BcII-HS metal sites, whereas di-Zn(II) BcII-HD seems to be the main species in solution at neutral pH. One of the most controversial issues in MLmediated catalysis has been the role and essentiality of each Zn(II) ion.21,26­29. In the case of wild-type BcII, although the first crystal structure revealed a single Zn(II) ion bound to the 3H site (Figure 3(a)),13 other mono-Zn(II) structures of BcII at high resolution (pdb 2bc2 and pdb 3bc2) displayed an oxidized Cys221 residue, unable to bind a second metal ion. In contrast, EXAFS data in solution of BcII with one Zn(II) equivalent could only be interpreted by assuming partial binding to the 3H and to the DCH site, suggesting that the metal site occupancy may not be sequential.41 Thus, it has been difficult to assess the catalytic efficiency of the pure mono- and di-Zn(II) forms of wild-type BcII. There are two special features of these mutants that make them attractive to acquire information on ML catalytic mechanism. On the one hand, the BcII-HS mutant binds the two Zn(II) ions sequentially, and binding of the second Zn(II) acts as an enzymatic activity switch. On the other hand, the BcII-HD mutant represents one of the few examples of a poorly active ML mutant with a tightly bound dinuclear site,37 whereas most studies altering the metal ligands have rendered mutants with impaired metal binding capabilities.35,36,44,45 Atomic models and EXAFS data for BcII-HD and BcII-HS in their mono and dinuclear forms can be exploited to help understand their catalytic behavior. The crystal structure of di-Zn(II) BcII-HD shows that Zn2 adopts a different, more buried position compared to wild-type BcII (Figure 8(a)). The engineered His121 residue provides a relatively rigid metal ligand, since its side-chain adopts the same orientation in all the structures reported herein, regardless of whether Zn2 is present or not. In contrast, His263 is intrinsically flexible in the absence of Zn2, displaying two possible conformations. Thus, binding to His121 is entropically favored compared to binding to His263. As a result, Zn2 is anchored to Asp120, His121 and Asp221, in a position shifted by 1.98 Å with respect to the same metal site in wild-type BcII (Figure 8). EXAFS of BcII-HD indicate a Zn-Zn distance of 3.73 Å, substantially shorter than the value of 4.73 Å obtained crystallographically. Crystals of di-Zn(II) BcII-HD were obtained by soaking in excess Zn(II) and ammonium sulfate close to saturation, which could provide an ionic strength high enough to affect

shows no evidence for the presence of a Cys ligand to either Zn. Beyond the first shell and the histidine multiple-scattering, inclusion of the carboxylate carbon alone only marginally improves the fit residual (7%). In contrast, inclusion of the Zn­Zn interaction alone gives a 45% reduction in residual, and clearly matches a missing frequency component in the fit. Addition of both carboxylate carbon and Zn­Zn gives a 63% overall improvement in R, and a 27% improvement over the Zn­Zn alone. These observations can be accounted for by the presence of five imidazole N atoms belonging to three His residues at the Zn1 site (His116, His118 and His196) and two at the Zn2 site (His121 and His263), whereas the remaining oxygen atoms are distributed amongst a monodentate Asp120, plus water/OH- (or, despite being more unlikely, the side-chain of Ser221). Most importantly, the Zn­Zn distance of 3.42 Å, while shorter than the distance of 3.70 Å reported for wild-type di-zinc BcII (EXAFS data),41 is identical to the Zn­Zn distance in the B3 lactamase L1 from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (EXAFS data),43 confirming the original notion of engineering a B3-like site into BcII.

Discussion
Here we have designed, expressed and characterized two double mutants of the B. cereus metallo-lactamase, BcII. These mutants resulted from the introduction of the His121/Asp221 and His121/ Ser221 pairs in the BcII scaffold, giving rise to mutants BcII-HD and BcII-HS, respectively, aimed to mimic the metal coordination spheres of structurally related proteins. BcII-HD possesses the metal ligand set ubiquitous in most members of the ML superfamily, but that are devoid of -lactamase activity. Instead, BcII-HS reproduces the metal binding site of MLs from subclass B3. Both double mutants exhibited impaired -lactamase activities, with different behaviors depending on the Zn(II) content. Both mutants consistently re-

the relative position of both metal ions. Indeed, members from the ML superfamily often display the metal ions close enough to allow a native Asp221 residue in a monodentate-bridging fashion, which is not observed in the BcII-HD form stabilized in the present crystallization conditions. In contrast, the EXAFS experiment was run in solution at milder conditions, in the same buffer employed for the enzymatic assays. Thus, we regard the Zn­Zn distance from spectroscopy (3.73 Å) as more representative of the conditions present during the kinetic measurements. This inter-metallic distance is closer to that observed previously, both by EXAFS and by crystallography, in wild-type BcII, but significantly longer than that observed in di-Zn(II) BcII-HS (3.43 Å) and other members of the ML superfamily. The scattering pattern in the EXAFS data from BcIIHD are nearly superimposable with those from AHL lactonase, a di-Zn(II) hydrolase from the ML superfamily,32 suggesting that we have successfully mimicked this metal site. A comparison of the active sites of wild-type BcII, AHL lactonase and BcII-HD (Figure 8(b)) shows that the position of Zn2 in BcIIHD resembles more closely that in AHL lactonase than that in wild-type BcII. Moreover, the shape of the experimental electron density in the Zn2 site of BcII-HD (Figure 8(b)), illustrates the large temperature factors displayed by Zn2. Within these limits, a metal site closer to that observed in AHL lactonase (i.e. with a smaller Zn-Zn distance than 4.73 Å) can account for the data obtained for di-Zn(II) BcII-HD in solution. Taken together, these observations suggest that the 3.73 Å Zn­Zn distance derived

from the EXAFS indicates a more buried Zn2 site in BcII-HD relative to BcII, notwithstanding its similarity to the 3.85 Å Zn­Zn distance reported for the wild-type enzyme. Another possibility that cannot be discarded to account for the shorter Zn­Zn distance from the EXAFS data is that Asp221 bridges the two Zn(II) ions as a bidentate ligand, instead of being monodentate, as in AHL lactonase.46 This situation would also imply a more buried Zn2 site. The structures of the reaction products of moxalactam with L1 (a B3 enzyme)27 and biapenem with CphA (a B2 enzyme)21 have suggested a common role for Zn2 in MLs. In both cases, the Zn2 site displays a strong interaction with the bridging nitrogen of the hydrolyzed -lactam ring and the carboxylate moiety of the antibiotic. Based on these results, Zn2 is expected to favor C­N bond cleavage by stabilization of the development of negative charge in the -lactam nitrogen atom,26 and it would be crucial in defining the substrate-binding mode.27,30,45,47­49 Zn2 is also expected to orient a water molecule acting as a proton donor in the ratedetermining step.47 Our results are in line with these concepts, since the engineered Zn2 site in BcII-HD remains less solvent-accessible and devoid of vacant coordination positions to allow its interaction with the substrate compared to wild-type BcII (Figure 8(a)). This allows us to explain the poor catalytic activity of BcII-HD even in the di-Zn(II) form. All the three structures of the mono-Zn(II) mutants show a single Zn(II) ion in the 3H site, and provide the most adverse catalytic scenarios, being poor both at substrate binding and catalysis. Mono-Zn(II) BcII-HD

Altering the Zn2 Position in Metallo--Lactamases

1151 and B3 lactamases are phylogenetically distant51 and present different topologies in the active site, here we demonstrate that engineering the ligand set of a B3 lactamase into the scaffold of a B1 enzyme does not abolish its catalytic performance. This study shows the flexibility of the ML scaffold and suggests that all MLs may exploit the Zn2 site in a similar way to bind -lactam substrates. Given that recognition of the -lactam ring is a key step in the reaction pathway, MLs may well have converged to a general catalytic mechanism despite their variability in tertiary structure and active site diversity.

at pH 4.9 lacks a water ligand, the closest water molecule (WAT2) being located at 4.07 Å, and a similar situation is observed for mono-Zn(II) BcII-HS at pH 4.9 (WAT2 at 3.30 Å). However, the structure of BcII-HS at pH 7 shows a Zn1 site coordinated to two solvent molecules (Figure 6), suggesting that the low activity of the mono-Zn(II) form would not be due to the absence of an activated nucleophile. Interestingly, this metal site closely resembles that of the single mutant C221S BcII,50 displaying a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with two metal-bound solvent molecules at the 3H site. BcII-HS displays a sequential Zn(II) binding scheme, as discussed. This has also been observed by de Seny and co-workers in C221S BcII, since removal of Cys221 provides a weaker ligand set at the Zn2 site.35 The activity of di-Zn(II) Cys221Ser BcII compares well to that of wild-type BcII, suggesting that the negative charge and softness of the Cys221 thiolate allows the full occupancy of the Zn2 site of BcII at low Zn(II) concentrations. However, while diZn(II) Cys221Ser BcII is fully active, di-Zn(II) BcII-HS is one or two orders of magnitude less active than BcII. Such difference can only be attributed to the newly introduced His121 ligand, which acts affecting the charge density and position of Zn2, thus altering the reactivity of the metal site. EXAFS spectroscopy on di-Zn(II) BcII-HS suggests two possible protein ligand sets for the Zn2 site: His121 and Asp120 (in a position similar to the Zn2 site in BcII-HD); or Asp120 and His263 pair (resembling the wild-type enzyme), with the coordination sphere being completed by solvent molecules in both cases. Ser221 could act as a weak metal ligand, but it would not play a central role in defining the position of the Zn2 site. Thus, Zn2 could adopt a less distorted position than in di-Zn(II) BcII-HD, closer to the one in wild-type BcII, which would account for its higher activity. In summary, the structure­function relationships of BcII-HD and BcII-HS are in line with the accepted substrate-binding mode of B1 and B3 MLs, in which the Zn2 plays a critical role, since both mutants show that changes affecting the relative position of Zn2 can largely impair the -lactamase activity of BcII. However, based on the complexity of the present system, we cannot completely rule out other structural factors altering the lactamase activity in these mutants. The increasing number of reported monometallic Zn2-only MLs, such as CphA,21 ImiS23 and GOB30 strongly supports our hypothesis. It is noteworthy that the mutant aimed to mimic the active site of other members of the superfamily (BcII-HD) is a very poor lactamase, while the single mutant R121H is very active.40 This suggests that the particular ligand set in MLs, differing from the nonlactamase members of the superfamily, is needed to provide this enzymatic activity. In particular, Asp221 seems to limit the development of lactamase activity within this fold. This phenomenom seems to occur in BcII-HD despite the fact that does not act as a bridging ligand according to the crystal structure of this mutant. On the other hand, despite B1

Materials and Methods
Cloning and expression Expression vectors for double mutants BcII-R121H/ C221S (BcII-HS) and BcII-R121H/C221D (BcII-HD) were obtained as follows. Simple mutants available in the laboratory were cloned in pBluescript KSII(­), in E. coli JM109 host strains: a BamHI-PstI 338 bp fragment coding for the N-terminal region of BcII-R121H, with an SphI marker site; and PstI-HindIII 358 bp fragments coding for the C-terminal regions of BcII-C221S and BcII-C221D, both with a SalI marker site. These fragments were purified and ligated through the corresponding PstI sites so as to obtain the 696 bp fragments coding for BcII double mutants R121H/C221S and R121H/C221D, cloned in pBluescript KSII(­). Expression vectors pET-HS and pET-HD, coding for BcII-HS and BcII-HD proteins, respectively, were obtained as a result of sub-cloning the corresponding 696 bp DNA fragments into the BamHI-HindIII sites of the expression vector pETGEX-Term. Both constructs were checked by restriction analysis and PCR sequencing. pETHS and pET-HD expression vectors were employed to overexpress and purify the double mutants as described.52 Protein purity was checked by SDS­PAGE. Preparation of protein samples The proteins as-purified (2 mg/ml) were dialyzed against stock buffer (15 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.2 M NaCl) (two changes), to remove the excess Zn(II). Such zincrinsed samples were utilized in the preparation of enzyme samples for kinetic assays and Zn(II) content determinations, along with the production of apo-proteins. Mono-Zn(II) BcII-HS was obtained by dialysis against stock buffer in the presence of Chelex 100 (Sigma) (three changes). Mono-Zn(II) BcII-HD was obtained by dialysis against zinc-free stock buffer with the addition of 100 M sodium dipicolinate, followed by two dialysis steps against zinc-free stock buffer. Di-Zn(II) enzyme samples were obtained by dialysis against 10 M and 80 M Zn(II) sulfate, for BcII-HD and BcII-HS, respectively. Zn(II) content was confirmed by the PAR method (see below). Apo-proteins were obtained by dialysis of zinc-rinsed samples against stock buffer added with 40 mM EDTA (two changes), followed by 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl (three changes) and finally stock buffer in the presence of Chelex 100 (three changes). All dialysis steps were carried out at 4 °C, against not less than 200 volumes of the corresponding buffer, for a period of at least 5 h. Samples were concentrated with Centriprep and Centricon centrifugal filters, and Amicon stirred cells, with

exception of nitrocefin, which was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide. Benzylpenicillin solutions were used immediately after preparation. Stock solutions of imipenem were stored at -70 °C, whereas nitrocefin, cefotaxime and cefaloridine were stored at -20 °C. Steady-state kinetics and data analysis

The protein Zn(II) content was determined by equilibrium dialysis. Zn(II) measurements were performed by atomic absorption on a Metrolab 250 AA instrument, and a colorimetric assay with 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR) under 4 M guanidinium chloride denaturing conditions, in zinc-free 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5).53 Zn(II) titration of apoenzymes Zn(II) titrations were carried out as follows. A thoroughly washed 200 ml capacity stirred ultrafiltration cell, with a 10 kDa cutoff YM-10 membrane (Amicon Bioseparations) was loaded with 100 ml of 6 M apo enzyme, in Chelex-treated 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.2 M NaCl at 25 °C. A 5 l aliquot of 20 mM Zn(II) sulfate was added to the reservoir solution, allowing equilibration for 5 min with stirring. Then, 1 ml aliquots were extracted from the reservoir and the filtrate, which were used to Zn(II) content determinations and measurement of -lactamase activity. The substrate employed was 200 M nitrocefin, which was followed spectrophotometrically at 485 nm without the interference of protein absorption at 280 nm. Finally, zinc-free buffer was added to the system, in order to keep a constant 100 ml volume. This process was repeated until reaching three and five Zn(II) equivalents, for BcII-HS and BcII-HD, respectively. The metal content and activities measured in this way were corrected for the dilutions and plotted as a function of the total Zn (II)/enzyme ratio (Zn(II) equivalents), as depicted in Figure 4. The Zn(II) titration curves can be suitably explained assuming simple two-site or three-site metal-binding models, respectively for BcII-HS and BcII-HD, where each Zn(II) dissociation step of the form enzyme-Zni  enzyme-Zni-1+Zn is associated with a dissociation constant Ki. Both the Zn(II) content curve and the nitrocefinase activity curve were simultaneously fitted to the corresponding metal binding model employing the program DynaFit.54 In order to obtain estimates of the dissociation constants compatible with the measurement conditions, it was assumed that mono-Zn(II) enzymes bind the first Zn(II) cofactor with a fixed K1 value of 0.1 nM, which is in the order of those reported by de Seny and co-workers.41 Antibiotics All chemicals were of the best quality available. Benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime and cefaloridine were purchased from Sigma. Nitrocefin was purchased from Calbiochem. Imipenem was purchased from Merck Sharp and Dohme. All antibiotics were quantified spectrophotometrically through complete enzymatic hydrolysis, with the following molar extinction coefficients: benzylpenicillin,  235 nm = - 800 M - 1 cm - 1 ; cefotaxime, 260 nm = -7500 M- 1 cm- 1; imipenem, 300 nm = - 9000 M- 1 cm- 1; cefaloridine, 260 nm = - 10,200 M- 1 cm- 1; and nitrocefin, 485 nm = 17,420 M- 1 cm- 1. Stock solutions were prepared in 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), with the

The time-course of reactions was monitored by UV-vis spectrophotometry, utilizing a Jasco-550 spectrophotometer with thermostatted cell holder. Steady-state kinetic parameters for imipenem were obtained by the initial rates method, while non-linear fitting of the complete timecourse of reactions was used for benzylpenicillin, nitrocefin, cefaloridine and cefotaxime. The fitting model employed was the standard Michaelis­Menten equation. When KM was much higher than the maximal substrate concentration achievable in the cuvette, a first-order kinetics was assumed yielding kcat/KM as the time-course exponential decay constant or the initial slope of substrate concentration plotted versus specific activity. Complete hydrolysis of substrates was attained with enzyme concentrations in the micro-molar range, e. g. 0.5­ 2.5 M BcII-HS and 10­30 M BcII-HD. Nitrocefin kinetic parameters, which fall in the micromolar range, were checked using a corrected model without the assumption that total enzyme concentration is negligible in comparison to initial substrate concentration.55 Fitting algorithms were implemented that find kinetic parameters through Levenberg­Marquardt least-squares minimization, Newton­Raphson root finding and Runge­Kutta numerical integration. The reaction medium was zinc-free 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.2 M NaCl, at 30 °C, with the addition of variable Zn(II) amounts, as detailed in the text and Table 1. Crystallization Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystallization trials were performed in VDX multi-well plates with a 300 l reservoir solution (Hampton Research). Drops consisted of 2 l protein solution (2 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.0) and 2 l reservoir solution. Crystallization was carried out at 20 °C. Two types of crystallization conditions were used to obtain diffraction quality crystals of both mutants. Condition 1 consisted of 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.9) containing 2.8 M ammonium sulfate, and condition 2 consisted of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 5.4) containing 60 mM sodium tartrate and 18% (w/v) PEG 3350. After one day, the drops were streak-seeded from a crystal of the BcII-C221D mutant grown in the same conditions as the wild-type enzyme.16 Many small crystals grew after one day in condition 1 and after three to four days diffraction quality crystals grew in condition 2. Diffraction quality crystals in condition 1 were obtained by one round of macro seeding. Some of the small crystals were transferred to a fresh solution of protein in reservoir solution. Crystals of approximately 100 m × 30 m × 30 m were obtained using this procedure. Crystal soaking and cryo-cooling Once harvested, crystals obtained from condition 1 were soaked in the same crystallization solution containing 20 mM Zn(II) sulfate for a minimum of 24 h. These

the side-chain (Thr7, Val8, Lys10, Lys23, Trp59, Lys96, Lys116, Lys117, Lys176, Arg201, His210 and Lys227 for monomer A, and Lys6, Lys23, Lys50, Lys62, Arg78, Lys96, Lys116, Lys117, Tyr120, Asn210, Lys176, Glu188 and Arg201 for monomer B). The final model of the BcII-HS mutant in space group C2 consists of residues 7­32 plus 39­227. This accounts for 94.7% of the residues (215 out of 227). Some surface residues present partial electron density for the side-chain (Ile9, Lys10, Glu12, Thr13, Lys23, Lys50, Trp59, Lys62, Lys96, His210 and Glu212). Missing residues could not be traced, due to lack of electron density. The final model of the BcII-R121H/C221D (BcII-HD) mutant in space group C2 with one Zn(II) ion in the active site consists of residues 7­32 plus 39­227. This accounts for 94.7% of the residues (215 out of 227). Some surface residues present partial electron density for the side-chain (Val8, Ile9, Lys10, Lys12, Thr13, Thr15, Lys23, Lys62, Lys96, Lys198, Arg201, Glu212 and Lys216). In the case of BcII-HD mutant in space group C2, with two Zn(II) ions in the active site, the model consists of residues 6­32 plus 39­ 227. This accounts for 95.2% of the residues (216 out of 227). Some surface residues present partial electron density for the side-chain (Lys10, Glu12, Thr13, Thr15, Lys23, Lys50, Trp59, Lys62, Lys96, Asn137, Lys139 and Glu212). Missing residues could not be traced due to lack of electron density. All Figures were produced with PyMOL. X-ray absorption spectroscopy BcII samples ( 1 mM) were prepared with 20% (v/v) glycerol, and loaded in Lucite cuvettes with 6 m polypropylene windows, before rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. The EXAFS experiments were run in samples in 15 mM Hepes(pH 7.5), 0.2 M NaCl, with no extra added Zn(II). X-ray absorption spectra were measured at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY), beamline X9B, with a Si(111) double crystal monochromator; harmonic rejection was accomplished using a Ni focusing mirror. Data collection and reduction were accomplished according to published procedures.32 The data in Figure 7 represent the average of the six to eight scans per sample. Fourier filtered EXAFS data (k = 1­13 Å- 1; R = 0.5­ 2.1 Å, first shell or 0.1­4.5 Å for multiple scattering fits) were fit utilizing theoretical amplitude and phase functions calculated with FEFF v. 8.00.61 The Zn-N scale factor and the threshold energy, E0, were calibrated to the experimental spectrum for tetrakis-1-methylimidazole zinc(II) perchlorate, Zn(MeIm)4 and held fixed (at 0.78 and - 21 eV, respectively). First shell fits were then obtained for all reasonable coordination numbers, including mixed N/O ligation, while allowing the absorberscatterer distance, Ras, and the Debye­Waller factor, 2 , to as vary; the best fits are presented in the Supplementary Data. Multiple scattering contributions from histidine ligands were fit according to published procedures.43 Metal­metal (Zn­Zn) scattering was modeled with reference to the experimental EXAFS of Zn2(salpn)2.62 Protein Data Bank accession codes Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank with the accession codes 2NZE (mono-Zn(II) BcII-HS from P3121 crystals),  http://pymol.sourceforge.net/

crystals did not stand higher pH and rapidly dissolved. Crystals from condition 2 were soaked for a minimum of 24 h in solutions of 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 7.0), 2.8 M ammonium sulfate containing 20 mM Zn(II) sulfate. Crystals were soaked in a cryo-protectant solution prepared with the soaking solution together with 18% (v/v) of glycerol, mounted in nylon loops and flashcooled in liquid nitrogen. Data collection and processing X-ray diffraction intensities were collected at the D03BMX1 beamline, Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron (Campinas, Brazil) using a wavelength of 1.421 Å and a MAR CCD 165 detector (MAR Research). Crystals belonging to the P3121 space group were collected with 0.2° oscillation and those belonging to the C2 space group were collected with 1° oscillation. Data were processed with HKL200056 and the CCP4 suite of programs.57 Data collection statistics are shown in Table 2. Structure determination Throughout this section, the wild-type BcII amino acid numbering is adopted for the sake of simplicity. Structures were solved by molecular replacement using the wild-type BcII 1bc2 structure, without ions and solvent molecules, as a starting model. The rotation and translation searches were performed with the program AMoRe58 implemented in the CCP4 suite57 using data from 12 Å to 3.5 Å resolution. The dimer was used as search model for P3121 space group and one monomer for C2 space group. Mutated residues were replaced by Ala. The first 2Fo­Fc electron density map showed clear density for the Zn(II) ions and for the side-chains of the mutated residues, which were built into the electron density and the structure was refined again. Solvent molecules were further introduced at stereochemically allowed positions corresponding to electron density peaks. Refinement was performed using REFMAC 5.2.59 The two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the P3121 space group were refined independently. Cycles of refinement were alternated with rounds of manual model building with TURBO-FRODO using  A weighted 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc electron density maps. A total of 5% of reflections was used to calculate the Rfree value throughout the refinement process. Solvent molecules were introduced with the program TURBOFRODO at stereochemically allowed positions corresponding to electron density peaks. The final models were analyzed with the program PROCHECK.60 In all structures, the Ramachandran plot shows one single residue, Asp84, located in a forbidden region, as was found for the wild-type enzyme. Nevertheless, the electron density peak for this residue is clear enough for its proper modeling. Refinement and final model statistics are summarized in Table 2. The final model of the BcII-R121H/C221S (BcII-HS) mutant in space group P3121, with one Zn(II) ion in the active site, consists of residues 7­32 plus 39­227 in the first subunit and 6­32 plus 38­227 in the second subunit. This accounts for 95.2% of the residues (432 out of 454). Some surface residues present partial electron density for
