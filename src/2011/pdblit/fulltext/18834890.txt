Two lanthanide­organic frameworks Pr2[(NIPH)3Á3H2O]ÁH2O (1) and [Nd2(NIPH)3Á3H2O]ÁH2O (2) were synthesized via the self-assembly of Ln(NO3)Á6H2O (Ln = Pr or Nd) with 5-nitroisophthalic acid (H2NIPH) in the presence of imidazole under hydrothermal reactions. X-ray single-crystal diffraction analyses reveal that 1 and 2 are isomorphic and both exhibit an unprecedented 2D topological net. Compounds 1 and 2 both have a 3D supramolecular framework extended by hydrogen-bonding interactions between the adjacent layers. Furthermore, the magnetic behaviors for 1 and 2 in the temperature range of 2­300 K were investigated. Ó 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction In the past decade, the design and construction of metal­organic frameworks has attracted considerable attention in supramolecular and materials chemistry due to their various topological networks as well as potential applications in fluorescent probes, magnetic materials, catalysts, molecular sensors [1­9]. The pivotal point for the design and synthesis of desirable structures with functional properties heavily depends on the judicious choice and assembly of metal centers with the organic bridging ligands [10­12]. The lanthanide ions are extensively employed as building blocks to construct MOFs which exhibit fascinating architectures due to their high and variable coordination numbers and flexible coordination geometry [13­16]. More importantly, lanthanide ions often endow the MOFs with unique magnetism and luminescent properties. Rigid polycarboxylic acids, especially aromatic polycarboxylic acids such as phthalic, isophthalic and terephthalic acids, are widely adopted by the researchers to construct metal­organic frameworks owing to their flexible coordination modes and sensitivity to pH values of the carboxylate groups [17]. Besides, the rigid aromatic spacers of the aromatic polycarboxylic acids can exhibit interesting electronic and magnetic interactions between the metal ions in the network via possible conjugative interaction [18]. It has been also found from the literature that a simple change in the substitution

on the polycarboxylic acid dramatically changes the structure and magnetic behavior of the MOFs [17]. For example, the electron-withdrawing nitryl group (­NO2) on the 5-nitroisophthalic acid (H2NIPH) cannot only act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor, but also take on some spatial effects in the formation of polymeric networks [19]. To our knowledge, though MOFs constructed from transition metals and H2NIPH have been largely reported, their corresponding lanthanide coordination polymers are still scarcely observed [17,20­24]. Furthermore, nearly most of the reported lanthanide MOFs have been characterized with 3D structural features to this day [15,25­32], and those with 1D and 2D structures remained largely unexplored [33­36]. To fully investigate the potential physical properties of lanthanide based MOFs, it is essential to design and synthesis lowdimensional MOFs based on lanthanide ions. Therefore, we used 5nitroisophthalic acid as the organic-building block to assemble with lanthanide ions in the presence of imidazole, and successfully isolated two 2D-layered polymers, namely, [Pr2(NIPH)3Á3H2O]ÁH2O (1) and [Nd2(NIPH)3Á3H2O]ÁH2O (2). In this paper, we report the syntheses, structures, photoluminescent and magnetic properties of these two lanthanide coordination polymers. 2. Experimental 2.1.

Syntheses of the compounds A mixture of Ln(NO3)Á6H2O (0.5 mmol, Ln = Pr 1, Nd 2), 5-nitroisophthalic acid (0.5 mmol) and imidazole (1 mmol) were placed in a 20 mL of Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel with 10 mL of H2O. The mixture was heated to 160 °C in 4 h and kept to this temperature for 4 days. After cooling to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h, prism pale green crystals of 1 and prism pale purple crystals of 2 were obtained with the yields of about 40% and 45% based on respectively.

ence Fourier maps, while the H atoms of NIPH2À in 2 were treated by geometrical positions. The H atoms of water molecules in 1 and 2 were not added. The oxygen atoms of the nitryl group in 1 are positional disorder over two sites. The site occupancies of O11, O110 , O12 and O120 are 0.5, 0.5, 0.61 and 0.39, respectively. A coordination water molecule in 1 (O21w, O22w and O23w) or 2 (O19w and O20w) is positional disorder. The site occupancies of O21w, O22w and O23w in 1 are 1/3, while those of O19w and O20w in 2 are 1/2. Isotropical refinement was applied to one oxygen atom (O12) of the nitryl group in 2 so as to avoid abnormal thermal parameters in three directions (U11, U12 and U13). Except for O12 in 2, all of the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The crystallographic data and details of refinements for compounds 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1; selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Syntheses and spectroscopic studies

2.3. X-ray crystallographic data collection and refinement X-ray diffraction data of 1 and 2 were collected on a Rigaku Diffractometer with a Mercury CCD area detector and SCXMini (Mo Ka; k = 0.71073 Å) at 293(2) K, respectively. Empirical absorption corrections were applied to the data using the CrystalClear program [37]. The structures were solved by the direct method and refined by the full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL-97 program [38]. The H atoms of NIPH2À in 1 were located from differThe syntheses of 1 and 2 reported here were simply synthesized by mixing lanthanide nitrate with H2NIPH and the auxiliary imidazole ligand with the molar ratio of 1:1:2 through the hydrothermal reactions. Although imidazole is not incorporated into the products, it plays an important role in the formation of the final products since 1 and 2 could not be obtained when imidazole was absent. We speculate that it may function as a base to control the pH value of the reaction system. Similar reactions with other

lanthanide nitrates gave rise to uncharacterized precipitates. The IR spectra of 1 and 2 (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2) show the presence of vibrational bands 1651­1544 cmÀ1, which are characteristic of the asymmetric stretching of the deprotonated carboxylic groups of NIPH2À ligand. The symmetric vibrations of the complete deprotonated carboxylic groups are the absorptions at 1462­1356 cmÀ1. The bands at around 3400 cmÀ1 are attributed to vibrations for hydroxyls of water molecules. There are no absorptions at around 1730­1700 cmÀ1 indicating that the H2NIPH ligand is completely deprotonated. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of 1 and 2 with the patterns simulated on the basis of single-crystal structures are shown in Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4, respectively. The positions of the diffraction peaks in both patterns correspond well, which indicate that the as-synthesized samples 1 and 2 are pure. 3.2. Crystal structures of [Pr2(NIPH)3Á3H2O]ÁH2O (1) and [Nd2(NIPH)3Á3H2O]ÁH2O (2) Compounds 1 and 2 are isomorphic for they have the same space group and similar cell parameters (Table 1) with only a little difference in the numbers of coordinated and lattice water molecules. Therefore, only the structure of 1 was described here in detail. X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis reveals that the asymmetrical unit of 1 consists of two praseodymium centers, three crystallographical NIPH2À ligands, three coordinated water molecules and one lattice water molecule. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Pr1 atom is coordinated with two water molecules and six carboxylate oxygen atoms while Pr2 is surrounded by one water molecule and eight carboxylate oxygen atoms. These carboxylate oxygen atoms can be classified as four groups in terms of their coordination modes with the Pr ion: (i) (k1­k1)­l2 (O1, O14, O2 and O13A), (ii) (k1­l2)­l3 (O7 and O8A), (iii) (k2­l2)­l2 (O9B and O10B), (iv) k2 (O3C, O4C, O15B and O16B). The distances of Pr­ONIPH are in the range of 2.343(2)­2.691(2) Å and those for Pr­OW are from 2.405(6) to 2.750(7) Å. These values are all in the normal range [39]. In the framework of 1, two NIPH2À ligands adopting the k2­(k1­ k1)­l3 (Chart 1a, N1-contained, denoted as L1 in the following text) and (k1­l2)­(k2­l2)­l5 (Chart 1b, N2-contained, denoted as L2 in the following text) coordination modes, respectively, link Pr1 and Pr2 as well as their symmetry-related atoms to form a 1D fourstranded chain. The chains are further linked each other by other NIPH2À ligands with a k2­(k1­k1)­l3 coordination mode (Chart 1a, N3-contained, denoted as L3 in the following text) to make up of a 2D layer structure viewed along c axis (Fig. 1c). According to our investigation in Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC), the l5-NIPH2À coordination mode as that observed in 1 has not been observed for the metal­H2NIPH coordination polymers. The maximal coordination number of H2NIPH reported before is l4-NIPH2À [17,20,40]. From the topological point of view, the three crystallographical NIPH2À ligands can be viewed as three-connected (L1), five-connected (L2) and three-connected (L3) nodes, respectively. The coordination water molecules are all omitted for their terminal coordination. Accordingly, the Pr1 and Pr2 centers are five-con-

nected and six-connected nodes, respectively. Therefore, the (3,5,6)-connected 2D topological network can be defined as (L1/ L2/L3/Pr1/Pr2). This 2D net is analyzed by Topos program [41] giving rise to the Schläfli symbol of (426)(4862)(482)(4763)(46648410) and the vertex symbols for the five nodes (L1, L2, L3, Pr1 and Pr2) being 4Á42Á63, 4Á4Á4Á4Á42Á42Á42Á42Á63Á8, 42Á813Á822, 4Á4Á4Á4Á4Á4Á43Á62Á62Á87 and 4Á4Á4Á4Á4Á43Á62Á62Á8Á85Á88Á810Á812ÁÃÁÃ, respectively (Fig. 1d). To the best of our knowledge, there is no example of 2D topological net with such Schläfli symbol reported to date. There exist moderate offset pÁÁÁp intramolecular interactions in the 1D chain (the centroid­centroid distance between the closest benzene rings being 3.845 Å) (Fig. 1b). Strong hydrogen-bond interactions occur between the adjacent layers that arise from the coordinated water and carboxylate oxygen atoms (O13) with the separation of O19WÁÁÁO13i [symmetry codes: (i) 3 À x, 1 À y, 1 À z] being 2.832 Å. Thus, these resulting 2D layers are further extended by hydrogen-bond interactions into a 3D supramolecular architecture (Supplementary Fig. S6). 3.3. Thermogravimetric analyses To investigate the thermal stability of 1 and 2, TGA analyses have been carried out on crystalline sample (Fig. 2). The TGA curve of 1 indicates that there is a weight loss of 7.6% from 30 °C to 170 °C, which can be attributed to the loss of coordination and lattice water molecules (Calcd = 7.3%). And then it is stable up to 440 °C, from which the framework begins to collapse. The TGA curve of 2 is nearly the same as that of 1 and is not discussed here. 3.4. Photoluminescent properties The photoluminescences of 1 and 2 were measured using a Ti:Sapphire laser as the pump source. Compound 1 did not exhibit emission bands upon the radiation of laser in the solid state at room temperature, whereas 2 exhibits the characteristic emission bands of Nd3+ under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. 3. Under excitation at 808 nm, it displays a weak emission at 901 nm (4F3/2­4I9/2), strong emissions at 1055 and 1063 nm (4F3/2­4I11/2), and a very weak emission at 1341 nm (4F3/2­4I13/2) in the near infrared region [42]. 3.5. Magnetic properties The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility data of 1 and 2 have been measured for polycrystalline samples at an applied magnetic field of 1000Oe in the temperature range of 2­ 300 K, as shown in Fig. 4. vm is the molar magnetic susceptibility

depopulation of the Stark components deriving from the splitting of the free-ion ground state by crystal field [43,44]. 4. Conclusion In summary, two lanthanide MOFs based on 5-nitroisophthalic acid have been successfully synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. Compounds 1 and 2 both have a 3D supramolecular network formed by hydrogen-bonding interactions between the adjacent layers. Topological analyses show that they display an unprecedented 2D topological network. Compound 2 exhibits the characteristic emission bands of Nd3+ upon the radiation of laser in the solid state at room temperature. Magnetic studies reveal that the decrease of vmT with decreasing temperature can be mainly attributed to crystal field effects, which spilts the free-ion ground state. 5.

for per Ln atom. The experimental vmT values of 1 and 2 at 300 K are 1.65 and 1.51 cm3 molÀ1 K, respectively. These values are adjacent to the expected 1.60 and 1.63 cm3 molÀ1 K for one free Pr(III) (3H4, g = 4/5) and Nd(III) (4I2/9, g = 8/11) in the ground state, respectively. As the temperature is lowed, the vmT values of 1 and 2 decrease continuously to the values of 0.66 and 0.60 cm3 molÀ1 K at 2 K, respectively. Although the vmT values of 1 and 2 smoothly decrease with decreasing temperature, antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent Ln(III) (Pr or Nd) ions cannot explicitly deduced due to the existence of strong spin­orbit coupling for lanthanide atoms. The decrease in vmT possibly originates in the thermal
