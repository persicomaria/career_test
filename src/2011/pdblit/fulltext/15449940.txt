ABSTRACT: -1,4-Galactosyltransferase ( 4Gal-T1) in the presence of manganese ion transfers galactose from UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) that is either free or linked to an oligosaccharide. Crystallographic studies on bovine 4Gal-T1 have shown that the primary metal binding site is located in the hinge region of a long flexible loop, which upon Mn2+ and UDP-Gal binding changes from an open to a closed conformation. This conformational change creates an oligosaccharide binding site in the enzyme. Neither UDP nor UDP analogues efficiently induce these conformational changes in the wild-type enzyme, thereby restricting the structural analysis of the acceptor binding site. The binding of Mn2+ involves an uncommon coordination to the S atom of Met344; when it is mutated to His, the mutant M344H, in the presence of Mn2+ and UDP-hexanolamine, readily changes to a closed conformation, facilitating the structural analysis of the enzyme bound with an oligosaccharide acceptor. Although the mutant M344H loses 98% of its Mn2+-dependent activity, it exhibits 25% of its activity in the presence of Mg2+. The crystal structures of M344H-Gal-T1 in complex with either UDP-Gal,Mn2+ or UDP-Gal, Mg2+, determined at 2.3 Å resolution, show that the mutant enzyme in these complexes is in a closed conformation, and the coordination stereochemistry of Mg2+ is quite similar to that of Mn2+. Although either Mn2+ or Mg2+, together with UDP-Gal, binds and changes the conformation of the M344H mutant to the closed one, it is the Mg2+ complex that engages efficiently in catalyses. Thus, this property enabled us to crystallize the M344H mutant for the first time with the acceptor substrate chitobiose in the presence of UDP-hexanolamine and Mn2+. The crystal structure determined at 2.3 Å resolution reveals that the GlcNAc residue at the nonreducing end of chitobiose makes extensive hydrophobic interactions with the highly conserved Tyr286 residue.

-1,4-Galactosyltransferases ( 4Gal-T,1 EC 2.4.1.90/38) are a Golgi resident, type II membrane-bound family of enzymes ( 4Gal-T1-T7) that transfer galactose (Gal) in the presence of manganese ion, from UDP-Gal to N-acetylglu This project has been funded in part with federal funds from the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, under Contract N01-C0-12400.

cosamine (GlcNAc), either free or bound to an oligosaccharide of a glycoprotein or a glycolipid (1-3). The family members exhibit a high level of sequence identity in their catalytic domains (4, 5). Although they have the same donor sugar specificity, many of these are expected to transfer Gal to different oligosaccharides containing GlcNAc at their nonreducing end. Recent crystallographic studies on 4GalT1 have provided detailed information about the structure and function of the enzyme (6-11). These studies have shown that upon substrate binding 4Gal-T1 undergoes conformational changes that involve two loops: a short loop, residues 313-315 containing Trp314, and a longer loop comprising residues 345-365. The conformational changes of these two loops are highly coordinated. Trp314 in the small loop plays a crucial role in the conformational state of the long loop, in the binding of the substrates, and in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme (7, 12, 13). In the unbound state (open conformation), the side chain of Trp is exposed to the solvent (6, 13), and the conformation of the long loop is such that the UDP-Gal and the metal binding sites are exposed. Once the substrate binds, the side chain of Trp314 moves into the catalytic pocket to lock the sugar

Furthermore, this conformational change in the long flexible loop repositions the amino acid residues at the N-terminal region, creating a metal ion binding site, and at the C-terminal region, creating an oligosaccharide-binding cavity that is also a protein-protein interaction site for R-lactalbumin (LA) (6, 9, 11). LA is a mammary gland-specific protein that modulates the acceptor specificity of the enzyme toward glucose (14). LA binds at the extended sugar binding site, present only in the closed conformer of 4Gal-T1, leaving the monosaccharide binding site of the enzyme available for the binding of Glc or GlcNAc. Since LA competes with the oligosaccharide for binding to the extended sugar binding site (15, 16), it is not possible to crystallize 4Gal-T1 in the presence of LA with a bound oligosaccharide acceptor. The wild-type enzyme also does not crystallize in the presence of UDP or UDPhexanolamine, Mn2+, and oligosaccharides, thereby restricting our structural or biochemical studies on the interactions of oligosaccharides with 4Gal-T1. It has previously been shown that the sugar moiety of the sugar nucleotide is essential for efficiently inducing a conformational change in 4Gal-T1 (17). Of the six ligands that coordinate Mn2+, three are from 4Gal-T1: Asp254, Met344, and His347 (7, 11, 18). Residues Met344 and His347, separated by the hinge residue Ile345, are at the N-terminal region of the long flexible loop. The complete metal binding site is created only after His347 has moved during the conformational change to coordinate with the metal ion. To influence the conformational dynamics of the long loop, we mutated the residues of the metal binding region. Mutation of Asp254 or His347 results in either a total or large loss of the enzyme activity, while mutation of Met344 to Ala or Gln results in an only moderate loss of activity (18). These studies suggested that Met344 coordination with Mn2+ might not be essential for the catalytic activity. To further understand the role of Met344 in the metal binding and conformational change in 4GalT1, in the study presented here we mutated it to His and found that the mutant M344H-Gal-T1, in the presence of Mn2+, has only 1.5% of the wild-type enzyme activity. On the other hand, the mutant M344H-Gal-T1 exhibits 25% of its catalytic activity in the presence of an alkali metal ion, Mg2+. In contrast, Mg2+ does not activate the wild-type enzyme. Although metal ions Mg2+ and Mn2+ bind to the mutant M344H-Gal-T1, their enzyme kinetics are different, indicating that the residue at position 344 and the appropriate metal ion play an important role in the conformational dynamics of the long loop in the catalytic mechanism of 4Gal-T1. In the presence of Mn2+ and UDP-Gal, or UDP-hexanolamine, the mutant M344H-Gal-T1 crystallizes in the closed conformation. This has enabled us to crystallize the mutant in complex with chitobiose, in the presence of Mn2+ and UDP-hexanolamine. In the crystal structure of the complex with chitobiose, the GlcNAc residue at the reducing end of the disaccharide binds to 4Gal-T1 in a manner similar to that of GlcNAc bound in the LS-GlcNAc complex (7, 11). The second nonreducing end GlcNAc residue of the disaccharide forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with the highly conserved Tyr286 residue. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ramakrishnan et al.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the PCR method. Construction of the mutants was carried out using plasmid pEGT-d129 as the template. This plasmid contains a BamHI-EcoRI fragment inserted into a pET23a vector, encoding residues 130-402 of bovine 4Gal-T1 (19), and has a Cys342Thr mutation. The mutation primers corresponding to the upper DNA strand are as follows: 5ATCGGGAAGACGCGTCACATCCGCCACTCGAGAGAC3 (M344H) and 5-ATCGGGAAGACGCGTGAGATCCGCCACTCGAGAGAC-3 (M344E). The restriction site MluI is shown in italics and the mutation codon in bold type. Typically, the Gal-T1 DNA fragment between MluI and EcoRI was PCR-amplified using the terminal cloning primer and the mutagenesis primer. The fragment was cut with restriction enzymes MluI and EcoRI and ligated with the precut plasmid pEGT-129 DNA with the same enzymes. Mutants were screened for the presence of full Gal-T1 DNA, and then sequenced. The positive clones were transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS cells as described previously (8). The mutant proteins were expressed and purified according to the published method (8). 4Gal-T Enzyme Assays. The protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, based on the Bradford method, and further verified on SDS-PAGE gels using standard protein concentration markers. An in Vitro assay procedure for Gal-T1 has been reported previously (8). The activities were measured using UDP-Gal as a sugar nucleotide donor, and GlcNAc ( GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc and -benzyl-GlcNAc) as the acceptor sugar. For the specific activity measurements, a 100 µL incubation mixture containing 25 mM GlcNAc, 5 mM MnCl2 or MgCl2, 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 500 µM UDP-Gal, 500 ng of M344H-Gal-T1 or 30 ng of C342T-Gal-T1, and 0.5 µCi of [3H]UDP-Gal was used for each Gal-T reaction. The incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 200 µL of cold water, and the mixture was passed through a 0.5 mL bed volume column of AG 1-X8 cation resin (Bio-Rad) to remove any unreacted [3H]UDP-Gal. The column was washed successively with 300, 400, and 500 µL of cold water, and the column flow-through was diluted with Biosafe scintillation fluid; radioactivity was measured with a Beckman counter. A reaction without the acceptor sugar was used as a control. A concentration of ZnCl2 or CoCl2 of only 0.1 mM was used whenever Zn2+ or Co2+ was used during the enzyme assay. Determining the Kinetic Constants. The enzyme activation data, at various concentrations of Mg2+, were fitted to an equation describing binding of metal to a high-affinity site (Kd1) to generate an enzyme form with a low kcat (V1) and to a second, lower-affinity site (Kd2) to generate a form with a higher kcat (V2) (18):

The true Km of the donor (KA) and of the acceptor (KB), the dissociation constant of the donor (Kia), and kcat were obtained using two-substrate analyses and the primary plots of at least five concentrations of the donor (UDP-Gal) and five concentrations of the acceptor, and the correspond-

where V is the initial velocity and the rate equation for a sequential, symmetrical, initial velocity pattern associated with eq 1, an ordered or random equilibrium mechanism in which substrate A dissociates well from the ECS complex with a dissociation constant of Kia. Equation 2 is for an asymmetric initial velocity pattern for a double-displacement, or "ping-pong", mechanism. The kinetic parameters KA, KB, Kia, and Vmax were obtained from the fitted curves using the rate equations given above. The graphical method and EnzFitter gave very similar kinetic parameters. In the 4Gal-T assay, the maximum substrate concentrations used for UDP-Gal and GlcNAc were 0.2 and 25 mM, respectively (which are 3-fold higher than their Km values). Crystal Structure Determination. The mutant M344H-GalT1 was cocrystallized in the presence of UDP-Gal and MnCl2 or MgCl2. The crystals were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop method, using 30 mg/mL mutant protein, 17 mM UDP-Gal, and 17 mM MgCl2 or MnCl2, with the precipitant containing 10% (v/v) dioxane, 100 mM MesNaOH buffer (pH 6.5), and 2.0 M ammonium sulfate. Complete three-dimensional X-ray diffraction data were collected at beam line X9B (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY), using a Quantum-4 ccd detector. The frames were processed using HKL2000 (21). The crystal and data collection parameters are listed in Table 1. Since the crystals were isomorphous with the C342T-Gal-T1,UDP-Gal,Mn2+ complex crystals,

that structure was used as a starting model without any substrate. An initial model containing Ala at position 344 was used. After initial refinement, the difference Fourier electron density maps not only confirmed the mutation but also revealed the UDP-Gal and Mn2+ or Mg2+ bound to the enzyme. These features were included in the further refinement. All the refinements were carried out with CNS version 1.0 (22). The final refinement statistics are given in Table 1. All figures were drawn using MOLSCRIPT (23), BOBSCRIPT (24), and Grasp (25). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Identification of the Metal Ions in the Crystal Structures. Since these crystals can be grown only if metal ions are used in the crystallization, it is safe to say that the metal ion used in the crystallization is the one observed in the crystal structure. Furthermore, a Mn2+ and a Mg2+ in the crystal structure can be differentiated by their relative electron density, compared to the phosphate groups to which they are bound. In the case of the Mg2+-bound structure, the difference Fourier electron density of the phosphate groups (16) is stronger than that found at the Mg2+ position (12), while in the case of a Mn2+-bound structure, the difference Fourier electron density at the Mn2+ position (24) is stronger than that of the phosphate groups (17). Furthermore, in these crystal structures, the average isotropic temperature factors for the phosphate group and the bound metal ion are comparable; they are 27 and 25 Å2, respectively, for the Mg2+-bound structure and 17 and 14 Å2, respectively, for the Mn2+-bound structure. Crystallization and Determina tion of the Structure of the M344H-Gal-T1,UDPH,Mn2+,Chitobiose Complex. The crystals of the complex were grown by hanging drop methods using the mother liquid containing 20 mg/mL protein, 2 mM chitobiose, 17 mM MnCl2, and UDP-hexanolamine, with the precipitant containing 1.8 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Mes-NaOH buffer (pH 6.5), and 10% dioxane. The threedimensional X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K, using an in-house X-ray generator equipped with a mar345 image plate. The data collection and the refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The data processing and the structure solution were carried out in a manner similar to the methods described above.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION M344-Gal-T1 Mutants Exhibit Broad Metal Ion Specificity. Previous studies have shown that ions of alkaline earth metals, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, or Sr2+, do not activate wildtype 4Gal-T1 because they do not bind to the primary metal binding site of the enzyme (3, 18) (Table 2). Various Met344 mutants, some of them generated in a previous study (18), were tested for their catalytic activity in the presence of several metal ions, including alkaline earth metals. Their metal ion activation specificities differed from that of wildtype 4Gal-T1 (Table 2). Among these mutations, the substitution of Met344 with His reduces the Mn2+- and Zn2+-dependent activity by 98%, but the mutant exhibits Mg2+-dependent activity that is nearly one-fourth of the Mn2+-dependent activity of the wild-type enzyme. The fact that the wild type, which has a Met residue at position 344, can be activated, in addition to Mn2+ by the transition metals Co2+ and Zn2+, suggests the participation of the side chain S atom of the Met residue in the metal coordination. On the other hand, when a His residue is present at position 344, even alkali earth metal ions can bind in the primary metal ion binding site, giving higher activities with Mg2+ (Table 2). Although the mutant M344H-Gal-T1 has only 2% activity in the presence of Mn2+, its activation curve is similar to that of the wild type in the presence of Mn2+ (Figure 1a,b). The observation that the activation of the wild type by metal ions is a sigmoidal curve has been interpreted as involving two metal binding sites of the enzyme: one with high affinity (Kd1), which is associated with low velocity, and the other with low affinity (Kd2), which is associated with high velocity (3, 18). The values of the dissociation constant (Kd) for Mn2+ of the mutant are quite different from that of the wild type (Table 3). The Kd1 of Mn2+ for the mutant is 25-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the Mn2+ binds tightly to the primary metal binding site of the mutant. However, the Kd2 for the mutant is 100-fold higher that that of the wild type, indicating that Mn2+ binds weakly to the second metal binding site of the mutant. The activation curve with Mg2+ for the mutant is also sigmoidal (inset) and strikingly similar to that of the wild-type enzyme with Mn2+

(Figure 1a,b). The sigmoidal velocity curve for the M344HGal-T1 mutant with the Mg2+ is also suggestive of two metal binding sites, with Mg2+ binding not only to the first site but also to the second metal binding site. The Kd values for the binding of Mg2+ to sites I and II are 100- and 7-fold higher, respectively, than those for binding of Mn2+ to the same mutant (Table 3), indicating that Mg2+ compared to Mn2+ binds weakly to the primary binding site of the mutant. Kinetic Parameters of the Donor and Acceptor Substrates for M344H-Gal-T1 in the Presence of Mg2+. Similar to those for the wild-type enzyme with the Mn2+ (26), the doublesubstrate kinetic data for the mutant in the presence of Mn2+ and Mg2+ fit best to a rate equation that lacks a Kia term, the dissociation constant of the UDP-Gal-metal-enzyme complex (eq 2). It describes an asymmetric initial velocity pattern associated with a sequential, or ping-pong, mechanism in which the donor substrate does not dissociate from the enzyme-substrate complex. In the presence of Mn2+, the true Km of the mutant for both the substrates, the donor UDP-Gal (KA) and the acceptor (KB), is nearly 13-fold reduced compared to that of the wild type, indicating that in the presence of Mn2+ the substrates bind strongly to the mutant. However, in the presence of Mg2+, the true Km values of the donor and acceptor for the mutant are nearly 5- and 2-fold higher, respectively, than that of wild-type 4Gal-T1 in the presence of Mn2+ (Table 3). Although the catalytic efficiency with respect to the donor and acceptor of the mutant in the presence of Mg2+, compared to that of the wild-type enzyme with Mn2+, has decreased by orders of magnitude of 13 and 6, respectively, the turnover number, the kcat of the mutant, is reduced by only 60%. The smaller effect on kcat than on kcat/Km reflects the fact that mutation (Met344 to His344) and metal substitution (Mn2+ to Mg2+) weaken both ground state and transition state binding, but the effect on ground state binding is greater as reflected in the poorer Km values. To determine if there are minor differences in the coordination geometry of the Mg2+ in the mutant compared with that of Mn2+ in the wild-type enzyme, which might explain the differences in the ground state binding and poorer Km values, we determined the crystal structure of M344H-Gal-T1 in complex with UDP-Gal in the presence of either Mn2+ or Mg2+ and compared the structure with the wild type,UDP-Gal,metal complex. Crystal Structure of the Mutant M344H-Gal-T1 in the Presence of Mn2+ and Mg2+. The M344H-Gal-T1 mutant crystallizes readily in the presence of UDP-Gal with either

FIGURE 1: Enzyme activity with increasing concentrations of the acceptor GlcNAc for the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant (a) and for the wild type (b) in the presence of either Mn2+ or Mg2+. Higher GlcNAc concentrations in the presence of Mn2+ inhibit the catalytic activity of the mutant M344H-Gal-T1, whereas such an effect was not observed with Mg2+. In the wild-type enzyme, with Met at position 344, the enzyme activity is high when Mn2+ is used as a metal ion. When Met344 is substituted with His, the mutant exhibits high activity in the presence of Mg2+. Thus, there seems to be a relationship between the residue and the choice of metal ion for the maximum catalytic activity of the enzyme. Insets show the sigmoidal metal ion activation curves. At lower concentrations of Mg2+, the activation curve of the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant is sigmoidal (inset in panel a), as is the wild-type enzyme activation at lower concentrations of Mn2+ (inset in panel b), indicating the presence of two metal ion binding sites in both the mutant and wild type. Mg2+ also binds to the second binding site in the mutant.

MnCl2 or MgCl2. On the other hand, wild-type 4Gal-T1 crystallizes only in the presence of UDP-Gal and MnCl2, but not in the presence of MgCl2. Inclusion of metal ion in the crystallization droplet was essential for obtaining the crystal. We determined the crystal structure of the mutant M344H-Gal-T1 in complex with UDP-Gal and Mn2+ or Mg2+ (Table 1). The three-dimensional crystal structures of these complexes are quite similar. The 4Gal-T1 mutant proteins were found in the closed conformation (Figure 2a), similar to the wild-type complex with UDP-Gal,Mn2+ (PDB entry 1O0R) (10, 11). The rms deviations between these structures and the closed structure of wild-type 4Gal-T1 vary between 0.5 and 0.6 Å on the CR atoms, indicating

that neither the mutation nor the binding of Mg2+ caused any significant change in the structure. In the crystal structure of the M344H-Gal-T1,UDP-Gal,Mg2+ complex, the metal nucleotide complex can be located clearly (Figure 2b). In these structures, the metal ions exhibit six similar coordination bonds with comparable bond distances (Table 4). Interestingly, the stereochemistry of the Mg2+ coordination is quite similar to that of the Mn2+ (Table 4). As before, the second metal ion could not be located in these studies. A comparison of the crystal structures of M344H-GalT1,UDP-Gal,metal complexes (Figure 2b,c) shows that the presence of the Mg2+ has not perturbed the interactions between the UDP-Gal and the protein molecule, the interac-

(b) Stereoview of the final electron density maps contoured at the 1.5 level around the UDP-Gal molecule and Mg2+ in the crystal structure of the M344H-Gal-T1,UDP-Gal,Mg2+ complex. The coordination of the magnesium ion is quite similar to that of the manganese ion, which includes the sixth coordination with a water molecule. The coordination distances between the H344 residue and the Mg2+ are shorter than the corresponding coordination bond between Met344 and the Mn2+ in the wild type (7, 11), indicating that even Mg2+ exhibits stronger binding to the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant. W represents a water molecule. (c) Binding of UDP-Gal,Mn2+ to the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant. The Mn2+ coordination is quite similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. However, the coordination bond between His344 and Mn2+ is stronger than the corresponding bond between M344 and Mn2+ in the wild-type enzyme (7, 11).

tions being similar to those found in the crystal structure of the wild-type protein, 4Gal-T1, in complex with UDP-Gal, Mn2+ (PDB entry 1O0R) (10, 11) However, the coordination distance between the N 2 atom of His344 and the metal ion is shorter (2.2-2.5 Å) than the corresponding coordination distance found for the sulfur atom of Met344 in the wild type (2.7 Å). This indicates that the presence of a His residue at position 344 strengthens the binding of the metal ion to the enzyme, consistent with the Kd1 values for Mn2+ observed with the mutant and the wild type (Table 3). Even though the coordination geometry of the Mn2+ and Mg2+ bound to

the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant is very similar, the higher affinity toward transition metal ion Mn2+ (Table 3; Kd1 ) 1.3 µM) over an alkali earth metal ion Mg2+ (Kd1 ) 160 µM) by the His residue could hinder the formation of the enzyme transition state complex during catalysis. The observed reduced enzyme activity for the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant in the presence of Mn2+ compared to that of the wild type or Met344Ala mutant is suggestive of that. Besides this effect, the role of the metal ion in determining the ability of the long loop to undergo the required open to closed, and back to open, conformation change during the catalytic cycle

seems to play an important role in determining the kinetics turnover number (kcat). Effect of the Acceptor Concentration on the Catalytic ActiVity of M344H-Gal-T1. In the presence of Mn2+, an inhibition of the catalytic activity of the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant was observed at GlcNAc concentrations of 2-5 mM (Figure 3a), whereas much higher GlcNAc concentrations (20-25 mM) were necessary to inhibit the catalytic activity of the wild-type enzyme (Figure 3b). The inhibition of the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant with higher concentrations of the acceptor is independent of the concentration of Mn2+ used in the assay (Figure 3a), while in the wild type, low concentrations of metal have no effect on acceptor inhibition (Figure 3b). Acceptors with higher affinity such as chitobiose ( GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc) and -benzyl-GlcNAc inhibit the catalytic activity of the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant at very low concentrations much more strongly than GlcNAc does (Figure 3c). On the other hand, in the presence of Mg2+, under the same conditions, these acceptors do not inhibit the catalytic activity of the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant, indicating that the acceptor substrate inhibition is metal ion-dependent. Inhibition at high acceptor concentrations has been shown as noncompetitive with respect to both Mn2+ and UDP (27), and it is the result of a dead-end enzyme,Mn2+,UDP,acceptor complex in the product release phase of the reaction (15). This indicates that during the catalytic cycle, the mutant is in the closed conformation in the presence of Mn2+ and UDP and is readily stabilized by the acceptor compared to the wild-type enzyme. This is consistent with a 13-fold reduction in the Km for GlcNAc of the mutant M344H-Gal-T1, in the presence of Mn2+ compared to that of the wild type (Table 3). There is also a 37-fold reduction in the kcat of the M344HGal-T1 mutant, which is related to the transition state complex and measures a 3-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KB) compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Since the acceptor binds to only the closed conformation, and UDP alone cannot cause an efficient conformational change from the open to the closed conformation (17), both the sugar acceptor and the metal ion seem to play important roles in the conformational changes in the mutant. This property seems to enable us to crystallize the M344H-GalT1 mutant with the disaccharide acceptor, chitobiose, in the presence of Mn2+ and UDP-hexanolamine (see below). Structure-Based Explanation for the Role of Metal Ion in the Conformational Dynamics of M344H-Gal-T1. During the catalytic cycle, upon metal ion and UDP-Gal binding, 4GalT1 undergoes a conformational change, from an open to a closed structure. This creates the acceptor-binding site of the enzyme. After catalysis and release of the product disaccharide or oligosaccharide, the closed conformation reverts to the open conformation, exposing the UDP and metal ion to

the solvent environment for their release, and a new round of the catalytic cycle follows. The primary metal binding site is situated in the hinge region of the long loop, where the metal binding residues, Met344 and His347, flank the hinge residue, Ile345 (Figure 4). In the open conformation, the metal ion coordinates with Asp254 and Met344 in 4GalT1. His347 coordinates with the metal ion only when 4GalT1 is in the closed conformation (7). Asp254 and His347 are strong metal ligands, while the coordination with Met344 is weak; thus, the product UDP and Mn2+ are easily released after the catalytic event. The manganese ion binds to the mutant M344H-Gal-T1 20-fold tighter than to the wild-type enzyme (Table 3; Kd1 ) 1.3 µM). Thus, in the product release phase, the release of UDP and Mn2+ may be delayed by keeping the enzyme in the closed conformation and facilitating the binding of the sugar acceptor with the formation of a dead-end molecule. This explains a strong inhibition of the Mn2+-dependent catalytic activity of the M344H mutant at low concentrations of various sugar acceptors compared to the wild-type enzyme. This is further evident in the fact that the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant readily crystallizes in the presence of UDP-hexanolamine (UDPH), chitobiose, and Mn2+ in the closed conformation, while the wild type has not so far crystallized under similar conditions. Furthermore, magnesium binds weakly to the mutant M344H-Gal-T1 with a dissociation constant (Kd1) that is 100-fold higher than the Kd1 for binding of manganese to the mutant. This allows the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant to undergo an efficient conformational change in the presence of Mg2+, with the release of a final product thus exhibiting no inhibition at low substrate acceptor concentrations. Crystal Structure of the M344-Gal-T1,UDPH,Mn2+, Chitobiose Complex. In the crystal structure, there are two M344H-Gal-T1 molecules in the asymmetric unit, and they are found in the closed conformation. As expected, one molecule each of Mn2+, UDP-hexanolamine, and chitobiose are bound to each protein molecule. The overall rms deviation of the CR atoms of the current structure with the M344H-Gal-T1,UDP-Gal,Mn2+ structure is only 0.6 Å, indicating the binding of the acceptor substrate has not significantly changed the overall structure of the molecule (Figure 5a). Of the six coordinations seen for the Mn2+, only five are quite similar to those found in the crystal structure of the M344H-Gal-T1,UDP-Gal,Mn2+ complex. The sixth coordination, with the anionic oxygen atom of the phosphate [P( )], is quite different. This is mainly due to the difference in the binding of UDP-hexanolamine to the M344H-Gal-T1 molecule. Although the overall binding of the UDP-hexanolamine is quite similar to the binding of UDP to the wildtype 4Gal-T1 in the closed conformation, the hexanolamine moiety at the anionic oxygen atom of the phosphate group

FIGURE 4: Comparison of the conformation of the long loop region of the open and closed structures of wild-type 4Gal-T1 (PDB entries 1FGX and 1O0R) (6, 11, 13). The electrostatic surface diagram of the portion of the enzyme molecule is shown, except for the long loop of residues 345-365. The negatively charged surface regions are red, while the positively charged surface regions are blue. The red tube corresponds to the open conformation of the long loop, while the blue tube corresponds to the closed conformation. In the open conformation, the long loop is placed in such a way that its His347 residue is away from the metal binding site. However, in the closed conformation (blue tube), the His residue forms a strong coordination bond with the metal ion. After catalysis, to release the product, UDP, and Mn2+, the enzyme returns to the open conformation. At this stage, the Mn2+ is expected to have only two coordination bonds with the enzyme molecule: with residues Asp254 and Met344. Since the coordination bond with the Met344 residue is weak, the bound UDP and Mn2+ can be released efficiently.

FIGURE 3: Effect of GlcNAc concentration on Gal-T activity of the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant (a) and wild-type enzyme, C342T-GalT1 (b), at different fixed concentrations of Mn2+: (a) (b) 6 µM, (O) 20 µM, (1) 0.5 mM, (3) 1.5 mM, and (9) 5 mM and (b) (b) 6 µM, (3) 80 µM, (9) 0.5 mM, (]) 1.5 mM, and (2) 5 mM. The activity of the mutant (a) is inhibited above 2-5 mM GlcNAc at any concentrations of Mn2+, whereas the activity of the wild type (b) is inhibited at 25-30 mM GlcNAc and above 0.5 mM Mn2+. (c) Effect of either GlcNAc, chitobiose, or -benzyl-GlcNAc concentration on Gal-T activity of the mutant M344H-Gal-T1 in the presence of 5 mM Mn2+. Arrows indicate the inhibition concentration for the respective curves. It is known that the disaccharide chitobiose binds strongly to the Gal-T1 compared to the monosaccharide GlcNAc. The higher the affinity of the acceptor substrate, the lower the required inhibition concentrations.

[P( )] could not be accommodated inside the galactose binding pocket. Thus, the whole phosphate group is displaced from the catalytic pocket and placed above the Trp314 side chain (Figure 5b).

The acceptor disaccharide molecule, chitobiose, can be clearly located from the difference Fourier electron density maps (Figure 5a). Binding of the acceptor sugar, GlcNAc 14GlcNAc, is observed with 4Gal-T1 in the absence of LA for the first time, and the interactions of the nonreducing end GlcNAc moiety of chitobiose with the M344H-Gal-T1 molecule in the crystal structure presented here are quite similar to those found in the 4Gal-T1,LA,GlcNAc complex (7, 11). The N-acetyl moiety of the GlcNAc molecule is bound in the hydrophobic pocket created by residues Arg359, Phe360, and Ile363. The side chain carboxylate group of Asp318 forms a hydrogen bond with the O4 hydroxyl group of the acceptor GlcNAc moiety of chitobiose (Figure 5c). Although the GlcNAc residue at the reducing end does not form any direct hydrogen bond with the M344H-Gal-T1 molecule, it forms hydrophobic interactions with the aromatic side chain of Tyr286 (Figure 5c). Enzyme kinetics studies have shown that at lower concentrations of GlcNAc the presence of LA enhances the transfer of Gal to GlcNAc; however, in the presence of chitobiose, LA exhibits competitive inhibition of the catalytic activity (15, 28). In the crystal structure of the 4Gal-T1,LA,GlcNAc complex, the aromatic side chain of Phe31 of the LA molecule was found to interact with the Tyr286 side chain of the 4Gal-T1 molecule (7, 11). Thus, LA competes for the same binding site (Tyr286) on 4Gal-T1 as the extended sugar residue of the chitobiose,

FIGURE 5: (a) Overall crystal structure of the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant in the presence of UDP-hexanolamine, Mn2+, and chitobiose. The difference Fourier electron density map contoured at 3 for the acceptor substrate is shown in blue. The Mn2+ is shown as a gray ball, while the UDP-hexanolamine is shown as a thick ball-and-stick diagram. (b) Molecular interactions of UDP-hexanolamine with the M344HGal-T1 molecule. Of the six coordinations found for the Mn2+, the coordination with the P( ) phosphate anionic oxygen atom is different from those of the earlier crystal structures. This is due the presence of the hexanolamine moiety, which could not be accommodated inside the Gal binding site. (c) Stereodiagram of binding of chitobiose to the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant. As can be seen, the GlcNAc binding of the acceptor in the active site in this structure is quite similar to that observed in the 4Gal-T1,LA,GlcNAc complex. However, the nonreducing GlcNAc residue of chitobiose forms hydrophobic interactions with the Tyr286 side chain aromatic region. The conformational torsion angles, (O5-C1-O4-C4) and (C1-O4-C4-C5), of the disaccharides are -77° and -130°, respectively, and they are similar to those of the -chitin structure (28). Furthermore, as in the -chitin structure, there is an intramolecular hydrogen bond observed between the O3 hydroxyl group and O5 of the chitobiose molecule.

an observation that is in accord with the kinetic data. These extra hydrophobic interactions alone seem to reduce the Km value for chitobiose to 1 mM, compared to 5 mM for the monosaccharide, GlcNAc molecule. It is important to note that among the 4Gal-T1 family members, this Tyr286 residue is highly conserved. Since 4Gal-T1 is mainly involved in the synthesis of complex N-glycan structures, as predicted earlier, longer oligosaccharides are expected to utilize the predicted oligosaccharide binding site on 4GalT1 (10). However, 4Gal-T1 is also involved in the synthesis of short oligosaccharides attached to proteins such as core structures, and the structure presented here serves as a model for the binding of such sugars. Using this mutant, we have been successful in crystallizing the enzyme in complex with various higher oligosaccharides (unpublished work). These studies are expected to reveal the binding of the oligosaccharide to 4Gal-T1.

CONCLUSION Results presented here show that in 4Gal-T1, the metal ion, in combination with a specific residue at position 344, plays an essential role in determining the kcat of the enzyme. Metal ion, together with UDP-Gal, has two functions. First, it must induce a conformational change, and second, it must engage in the formation and stabilization of the transition state complex during catalysis. It is the combination of a Met residue at position 344 with Mn2+ or the His residue with Mg2+ that determines the high kcat of the enzyme. The inability of the M344H-Gal-T1 mutant to return to the open conformation in the presence of UDP and Mn2+ has enabled us to crystallize the mutant in complex with chitobiose, a disaccharide acceptor, or with various higher oligosaccharides. The crystal structures of the complexes show that the second residue of the sugar acceptor forms an extensive hydrophobic interaction with the highly conserved Tyr286 residue of 4Gal-T1.
