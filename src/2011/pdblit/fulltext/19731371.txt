ABSTRACT The structure of the trimeric adenylate kinase from the Archaebacteria Methanococcus mariplaludis (AKMAR) ° has been solved to 2.5-A resolution and the temperature dependent stability and kinetics of the enzyme measured. The KM and Vmax of AKMAR exhibit only modest temperature dependence from 308­608C. Although M. mariplaludis is a mesophile with a maximum growth temperature of 438C, AKMAR has a very broad functional range and stability (Tm 5 74.08C) that are more consistent with a thermophilic enzyme with high thermostability and exceptional activity over a wide range of temperatures, suggesting that this microbe may have only recently invaded a mesophilic niche and has yet to fully adapt. A comparison of the Local Structural Entropy (LSE) for AKMAR to the related adenylate kinases from the mesophile Methanococcus voltae and thermophile Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus show that changes in LSE are able to fully account for the intermediate stability of AKMAR and highlights a general mechanism for protein adaptation in this class of enzymes.

INTRODUCTION Adenylate kinase (AK-E.C. 2.7.4.3) plays a critical role in cellular physiology, regulating the balance of adenylate species in vivo. Even a transient loss of AK function leads to a loss of cell viability and death.1 In addition to its physiological importance, AK has also served as a model for studies in molecular evolution,2,3 protein folding, and dynamics.4­13 There are two oligomeric classes of AK: monomeric as found in Eubacteria and trimeric as found in Archaebacteria. Crystal structures have been determined for representative members of both classes,12,13 although no kinetics data have been measured for any member of the trimeric AK family.13 We have determined the structure of the Methanococ° cus maripaludis AK (AKMAR) bound to the inhibitor Ap5A at 2.5-A resolution and elucidated the enzymatic properties of this enzyme to gain a better understanding of the evolution of protein thermostability and activity differences in the AK family of enzymes. AKMAR was crystallized in the space group R3(h) and displayed strong merohedral twinning (final twining fraction 5 0.39). Like other methanococcal AKs, AKMAR is trimeric but has very low homology compared with other AKs, supporting the idea that archaeal AKs are quite distinct from the monomeric AK family. Although no detailed kinetics exist for the Methanococcus voltae and Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus AKs, it was previously shown that the temperature range for maximum AK activity at a single substrate concentration and the degree of thermal stability reflected the optimal growth temperature of the source methanogen and was approximately 308­408C for M. voltae and 608­808C for M. thermolithotrophicus.14,15 Surprisingly, although M. maripaludis is a mesophile, AKMAR has properties similar to a thermophilic enzyme with high stability (Tm 5 74.08C) and excellent activity over a broad temperature range (308C­608C). Although a high stability would be expected of thermophilic archael strains, we show that AKMAR has an unusually high thermal stability and wide functional range for an organism that lives at temperatures less than 438C. Recently, a study on a Sac10b homolog in M. maripaludis was also shown to

have a higher temperature stability than expected.16 The unusual stability and functional range of AKMAR suggests that M. maripaludis may have only recently invaded a mesophilic niche or must retain broad AK function to survive temperature extremes within its environment. METHODS
Cloning, expression, and purification AKMAR

The gene encoding M. maripaludis AK (BX957221) was amplified from genomic DNA (ATCC 43000D) by polymerase chain reaction with forward primer 50 -CACC ATGAAAAACAAAGTTGTTGTAGTAACTGG and reverse primer 50 -TAGATTCAAACATGTTTTTTCCCC resulting in an amplicon of 579 bp. The gene was then cloned into NdeI and HindIII sites of pET11a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) cells. E. coli Rosetta cells containing the pET11a- AKMAR expression plasmid were grown at 378C in LB medium containing 50 lg/mL carbenicillin and 25 lg/mL chloramphenicol to midlog phase (OD600 5 0.6­0.7) and induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 19 hours at 308C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.3 mM DDT. Cells were lysed by sonication, and then cellular debris was subsequently removed by centrifugation. The sample was loaded onto a HiTrap Q-XL Sepharose anion exchange chromatography column equilibrated against 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.3 mM DDT and eluted with a 0­0.5M NaCl salt gradient. The fractions containing protein of interest were collected; dialyzed against 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.3 mM DDT; and passed over an Affi-Gel blue resin (Bio-RAD Lab, Hercules, CA) column. The absorbed protein was eluted using a salt gradient from 0.1­2.5M NaCl; fractions containing AKMAR were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). The protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and found to be greater than 95%.
AK activity assay

quots from the reaction mixture to an ice-cold tube containing the AK inhibitor P1, P5-di (adenosine-50 ) pentaphosphate (Ap5A) to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. The ADP produced at various time points were estimated using a secondary assay by the conversion of NADH to NAD1 as indicated by the absorbance at 340 nm (e340 5 6,200 M21 cm21). In the secondary reaction, 100 lL of a solution containing 0.6 mM NADH, 0.1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, and 5 units of pyruvate kinase was added to the aliquots from each time point. The reaction was allowed to proceed to completion at room temperature and then the absorbance at 340 nm measured. Afterwards, 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase was added, and the absorbance at 340 nm was measured again. The kinetic parameters (KM and Vmax) were estimated in an initial velocity versus ATP plot by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kaleidagraph version 3.51 (Synergy Software, Maxwell Resources Inc., Reading, PA). The experiment was performed in triplicate at each temperature. The enzyme activity of AKMAR was also determined at 308, 408, 508, and 608C for the formation of AMP by varying AMP concentrations and holding a constant ATP concentration (1.4 mM) using the endpoint assay described previously.
Thermal unfolding midpoint determined by circular dichroism

Thermal stability of AKMAR and the complex of AKMAR with the Ap5A were determined by changes in circular dichroism as a function of temperature (using Jasco J-815 CD instrument). The CD signal at 220 nm was recorded continuously as the temperature was raised. Data were acquired in 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 65 mM KCl and then converted into a plot of fraction unfolded versus temperature. The thermal unfolding midpoint (Tm) was calculated using the first derivative of the CD signal versus temperature.18 The stability of the ligand-bound, closed conformation was measured at 100 lM Ap5A.
Crystallization

The enzyme activity of AKMAR was determined at various temperatures (308, 408, 508, and 608C) in the direction of ATP formation by an endpoint assay.3,17 The reaction mixture consisted of the reaction buffer (25 mM phosphate buffer [pH 7.2], 5 mM MgCl2, and 1.4 mM Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)) and various ATP concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000 lM). This mixture was kept at the desired temperature for 5 minutes in a water bath before the addition of AK to a final concentration of 10 nM. The reaction was stopped at various time points by transferring 300-lL ali-

AKMAR screening trials were performed by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method using a sparse matrix crystallization approach.19 0.5 lL protein (15 mg/mL) with 20 mM Ap5A in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.5 lL mother liquor were mixed in a 96-well plate using Hydra II plus One crystallization robot (Matrix Technologies, Hudson, NH) and incubated at 228C. Initial screens for AKMAR revealed thin crystals growing in 3.5M ammonium chloride and 0.1M sodium acetate (pH 4.6). This condition was successively optimized using the vapor diffusion method with sitting drops (5 lL protein at 15 mg/mL and 5 lL mother liquor) at 228C. Crystals suitable for data collection were

Data collection and processing

Crystals of AKMAR were successively passed through cryoprotectant solutions consisting of 3.4M ammonium chloride and 0.1M sodium acetate (pH 4.7) complemented with 5%, 10%, 15%, and 25% (v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data for the AKMAR crystal were collected to ° 2.5 A resolution on an R-Axis IV 11 image plate detector system with Osmic mirrors at 21908C. The crystal belonged to the space group R3(h) with unit cell parame° ters a 5 102.8, b 5 102.8, c 5 228.7 A, a 5 90.0, b 5 98.7, and g 5 120.0. The data were processed using the program d*TREK20 (Table I).
Structure determination and refinement

was further confirmed by the initial composite omit map generated using CNS24 that clearly indicated strong electron density for Ap5A for each subunit that was not included in the original search model. Phenix.Xtriage25 analysis was performed for initial data characterization. The results of data analyses suggested that merohedral twining by the twin law, h,-h-k,-l, was possible; however, no significant pseudotranslation was detected. ° Structural refinement (20.0­2.5 A) was performed by using Phenix.refine25 and then Refmac526 with the twin specific target function. The initial model was improved by iterative rebuilding using (2Fo-Fc) a composite omit map made with CNS24 and (2Fo-Fc) SIGMAA, a weighted map made within Coot.27 The applicable merohedral twin law, h,-h-k,-l, was applied from the beginning and throughout refinement in Phenix.refine and reached a final value of 0.39. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were used initially but were later released. After TLS refinement,28 the R and Rfree were 23.6% and 28.2%, respectively. A new (2Fo -Fc) composite omit map was generated in CNS; clear density was present and was unoccupied indicating the presence of an additional copy in the asymmetric unit. So, a fourth copy (subunit G) was manually added. Additional electron density in the putative catalytic center was interpreted as Ap5A molecule bound occupying both ATP/ADP and AMP/ADP sites. Further refinement was performed in Refmac5,26 and 20 cycles of positional refinement using twin function and Biso refinement were followed by visual inspection of protein models and (2Fo -Fc) SIGMAA, a weighted density map in Coot.27 The AKMAR model has been refined to the R of 18.3% and Rfree of 23.9% (Table I). Ramachandran plots and root mean square deviations from ideality for bond angles and lengths for AKMAR were determined by using a structure validation program (MolProbity).29

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall structure and stability of AKMAR

A molecular replacement solution for AKMAR was found with the program Phaser for MR21 from the CCP4 suite22 using M. voltae AK (1KHT) in which ligands had been removed as a search model.13 The initial solution suggested three copies of the molecule in the asymmetric unit and a Mathews coefficient of 3.68 (66.6% solvent).23 The molecular replacement solution

The structure of AKMAR shows the conserved topology of this class of protein consistent with the strong sequence identity. AKMAR shares high amino acid sequence identity with other methanococcal AKs including those of the AKTHE (82%) and AKVOL (81%) (Fig. 1). The sequence homology between the archaeal enzymes and the monomeric NMP kinases is essentially restricted to the P-loop region.12­14,30,31 AKMAR is very stable, the midpoint of the transition for AKMAR unfolding occurs at 74.08C with no significant dependence on concentration from 2­40 lM protein and midpoint of unfolding for the AKMAR: Ap5A complex was 84.58C [Fig. 2(A)].

The primary sequence alignment of methanococcal AKs and AKSAC. The sequences were aligned by the program CLUSTALW and represented using the program BOXSHADE.36 AKMAR shares high amino acid sequence identity with other methanococcal AKs including those of the M. thermolithotrophicus (AKTHE, 82%), the M. voltae (AKVOL, 81%), and highly homologous to AKSAC.

The crystal contains four subunits (A, B, C, and G), where three subunits arranged around a three-fold symmetry axis and the fourth chain (G) forms a second trimer that is made by a three-fold crystallographic symmetry operator. Consistent with other methanococcal AKs, the trimeric interface is comprised of a three-helix bundle formed by the long helix 7 of each subunit [Fig. 3(A)] similar to other members of the NMP kinase family. The structure of the individual subunits is made up of a central b-sheet region surrounded by several a-helices that produce characteristic AMP-binding, LID and CORE domains. Like other methanococcal AKs, AKMAR is a member of the small variant AKs because its LID domain consists of a short loop (residues 135­144). Two additional strands, b4 and b5, extend the central parallel b-sheet in an antiparallel manner that is unique to trimeric archaeal AKs.13,32 AKMAR was crystallized with the inhibitor Ap5A bound to the active site [Fig. 3(B)]. Upon nucleotide binding, there is a dramatic change in conformation as the protein undergoes an allosteric transition essential to efficient analysis. During the change in conformation, the LID and CORE domains go from an ``open'' to ``closed'' conformation to exclude water from the active site. Our structure shows all three substrate binding sites of the trimer to be occupied with the protein in the ``closed'' conformation although the NMP binding site of one copy retains a more unliganded-like conformation, a state also observed for one subunit of M. voltae AK (AKVOL) bound to AMP.
Structural basis for the relative thermostabilities of AKMAR, AKVOL, and AKTHE

The structures of the available trimeric AKs were compared and evaluated for insights into their relative

stabilities. Several criteria were considered including (1) ° the number of potential salt bridges (<4A), (2) the number of b-branched amino acids, (3) potential hydrogenbonding interactions, (4) the relative B-factors, and (5) local structural entropy (LSE) (Table II). The number of potential electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding networks showed no clear correlation with stability although a potentially important intrasubunit ion-pair was identified at the trimeric interface of AKMAR and AKTHE between ° GLU150 and ARG156 (average distance 3.35 A). AKVOL has a glutamine at position 150 that may decrease the intersubunit stability. Although the trimeric quaternary structure of the archaeal AKs undoubtedly contributes to stability, AKVOL has a stability consistent with a mesophile and cannot be the sole source of the unusual stability of AKMAR. Earlier works have shown a correlation between the thermal stabilities for a given family of proteins and their overall LSE values.6,33 Chan et al.33 inspected how often each protein segment was found in one of eight secondary structure configurations. If protein segments exist equally well in many configurations, they were given a higher LSE value than those that appeared in only one or two secondary structure states.6,33 Figure 4(A) displays the computed structural entropy profiles of AKVOL (SVOL), AKMAR (SMAR), and AKTHE (STHE) (http://SDSE. life.nctu.edu.tw/)33 and their entropy differences as DSMV 5 SMAR- SVOL or DSTM 5 STHE 2 SMAR. Most of the residues involved in the thermal stabilization of AKs occur at or close to the DS minima (residues with large negative value [Fig. 4(A)]).6,13,33 Because previous biochemical studies6,10,33 have suggested that amino acid residues in the CORE domain are mainly responsible for the changes in the overall thermal stability, the average LSE values of AKVOL, AKMAR, and AKTHE for this domain were calculated.6,33 Figure 4B displays the plot

of Tm versus average LSE for the methanococcal AKs; AKMAR has a lower average LSE value than that for AKVOL, which correlates with the higher thermostability and indicates the importance of structural entropy in the stability of these proteins. The correlation becomes appreciably weaker if the entire protein including the LID domain is included and reflects the very high LSE

for the LID domains in all the AKs. The number of b-branched amino acids is substantially greater in AKTHE (15) than either AKMAR (8) or AKVOL (7) and may also play a role in reducing the flexibility of the protein consistent with the data from LSE analysis. In addition, a comparison of relative B-factors also proved well correlated to thermostability. The relative B-factors were calculated by taking the mean B-factor of every residue and dividing it by the mean B-factor of the whole protein.34 Only the relative B-factors of AMPbound subunits B and C of AKVOL versus liganded subunits (A and B) of AKMAR were compared because there are substantial changes in structure and stability associated with ligand binding. About 43% of the residues in AKVOL showed significantly higher (different by >10%) relative B-factors than those in AKMAR, whereas only 27% of the residues displayed a lower relative temperature factor. These results are in good qualitative agreement with the LSE analysis and suggest that increased flexibility may be partly responsible for the lower stability of AKVOL and that AKMAR is intermediate to AKVOL and AKTHE. A similar correlation was found for the monomeric AKs of psychrophile Bacillus globisporus (AKBG), psychrophile Marinibacillus marinus (AKMM), and mesophile Bacillus subtilis (AKBS).6,35 Figure 4(C) displays the comparison between the plots of Tm versus average LSE for the trimeric methanococcal and monomeric AKs. The trimeric AKs show consistently higher average stability than the monomeric AKs at comparable values of LSE and highlights the role of long distance quaternary interactions in providing additional stability.

perature for growth, 308C) and thermophile M. thermolitrophicus (optimal temperature for growth, 658C). Although no detailed kinetics exist for other methanococcal AKs, earlier works suggested that the temperature range for maximum enzyme activity was similar to the temperature for optimal microbial growth and was approximately 308­408C for M. voltae and 608­808C for M. thermolitrophicus.14 In addition, Haney et al.15 showed that the total activity of AKVOL decreased $20% from 378 to 528C. AKMAR shows no loss in activity over the same range [Table III, Figure 2(B) and (C)], and the temperature activity profile for AKMAR (optimal growth temperature of $358C) has a much broader temperature range (308­508C, similar to the thermophilic AKs). Growth studies on M. maripaludis suggest that the maximum temperature for the growth is less than 438C (A. Waters, personal communication, May 2009). In a previous experiment, we replaced the chromosomal copy of Geobacillus stearothermophilus AK with that of its mesophilic homolog from B. subtilis (AKBSUB), and these recombinant G. stearothermophilus with AKBSUB were viable to 558C.1 AKBSUB has comparable kinetic parameters to AKMAR at 558C, suggesting that cells relying upon AKMAR function at 558C would also be viable.3

CONCLUSIONS The crystal structure of M. maripaludis with bound ° Ap5A has been determined at 2.5-A resolution as well as its stability and substrate kinetics. Like other methanococcal AKs, AKMAR is trimeric, and the structure of each subunit is related to the other trimeric AKs but not the monomeric family, supporting the idea that archaeal AKs are a part of a unique class of AKs. The properties of AKMAR in many respects are more consistent with a thermophilic enzyme with high thermostability (Tm 5 74.08C) and exceptional activity over a wide range of temperatures (308­608C), suggesting that this microbe may have only recently invaded a mesophilic niche and has yet to fully adapt. An analysis of the available methanococcal AK structures suggests that changes in local structural entropy are able to provide a general mechanism of adaptation for this class of trimeric enzymes.
