*Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell. 1 A single crystal was used to collect the dataset. **The only Ramachandran plot outlier is the -site aPhe212, which is perfectly defined in the electron density and whose main-chain carbonyl group is held in place by a strong interaction with Ser178. Moreover, this residue is situated between two glycine residues. Structure factors and coordinates are available from the Protein Data Bank under code 3CEP.

Figure S1. Overview of a tryptophan synthase  heterodimer. The -site () and -site () are indicated and their respective ligands in the quinonoid structure are shown in sticks representation. The COMM domain (residues 102-189, COMM) is shown in blue. The approximate path of the indole tunnel is indicated.
