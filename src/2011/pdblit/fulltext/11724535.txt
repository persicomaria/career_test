Catalytic antibodies 6D9 and 9C10, which were induced by immunization with a haptenic transition-state analog (TSA), catalyze the hydrolysis of a nonbioactive chloramphenicol monoester derivative to generate a bioactive chloramphenicol. These antibodies stabilize the transition state to catalyze the hydrolysis reaction, strictly according to the theoretical relationship: for 6D9, kcat/kuncat = 895 and KS/KTSA = 900, and for 9C10, kcat/kuncat = 56 and KS/KTSA = 60. To elucidate the molecular basis of the antibody-catalyzed reaction, the crystal structure of 6D9 was determined, and the binding thermodynamics of 6D9 and 9C10 with both the substrate and the TSA were analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry. The crystal structure of the unliganded 6D9 Fab was determined at 2.25 Å resolution and compared with that of the TSA-liganded 6D9 Fab reported previously, showing that the TSA is bound into the hydrophobic pocket of the antigen-combining site in an "induced fit" manner, especially at the L1 and H3 CDR loops. Thermodynamic analyses showed that 6D9 binds the substrate of the TSA with a positive S, differing from general thermodynamic characteristics of antigen­antibody interactions. This positive S could be due to the hydrophobic interactions between 6D9 and the substrate or the TSA mediated by Trp H100i. The difference in G between substrate and TSA-binding to 6D9 was larger than that to 9C10, which is in good correlation with the larger kcat value of 6D9. Interestingly, the G was mainly because of the H. The correlation between kcat and H is suggestive of "enthalpic strain" leading to destabilization of antibody­substrate complexes. Together with X-ray structural analyses, the thermodynamic analyses suggest that upon binding the substrate, the antibody alters the conformation of the ester moiety in the substrate from the planar Z form to a thermodynamically unstable twisted conformation, followed by conversion into the transition state. Enthalpic strain also contributes to the transition-state stabilization by destabilizing the ground state, and its degree is much larger for the more efficient catalytic antibody, 6D9.

the induced antigen-combining site can be both geometrically and electronically complementary to the transition state for the reaction. This idea has been evaluated by correlating the catalytic activity and the binding affinity of the TSA. If antibodies catalyze reactions by virtue of a defined relationship between their affinity for the transition state and their catalytic efficiency, the ratio of the dissociation constants for the transition-state analog (KTSA) and

the corresponding substrate (KS) should be equal to the rate enhancement (kcat/kuncat = KS/KTSA). Transition-state theory relates the rate of a reaction to the difference in Gibbs free energy between the substrate and the transition state.5 To better understand the mechanisms underlying antibody catalysis, thermodynamic analyses of two catalytic antibodies binding with a TSA and a substrate were examined and are reported here.

200 Catalytic antibodies 6D9 and 9C10, induced by immunization with haptenic phosphonate 3, catalyze the hydrolysis of a nonbioactive chloramphenicol monoester derivative 1 to generate bioactive chloramphenicol 2, as shown in Figure 1.6 Antibodies 6D9 and 9C10 function strictly according to the theoretical relationship described above (for 6D9, kcat/kuncat = 895, KS/KTSA = 900; for 9C10, kcat/ kuncat = 56, KS/KTSA = 60).7 This suggests that binding in the antibody­TSA complex is essentially identical with that of the transition state for the antibody­ substrate reaction and serves to accelerate the reaction. Although the catalytic activity of 9C10 is about 10-fold lower than that of 6D9, both antibodies seem to use the same catalytic mechanism, given their similar sequences and transition-state analyses. Here, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the binding thermodynamics of 6D9 and 9C10 to both the substrate and the TSA were characterized to provide the fundamental binding thermodynamics parameters: Gibbs free energy change (G), enthalpy change (H), and entropy change (S).8,9 A comparison of the thermodynamic data obtained for the substrate and TSA binding to antibodies 6D9 and 9C10 could provide important insights into their catalytic mechanism. The crystal structure of 6D9 Fab complexed with the TSA was reported previously10 and showed that the oxyanion of the TSA forms a hydrogen bond with His L27d (the amino acid residues are numbered according to the consensus nomenclature of Kabat et al.11). This histidine is believed to be the primary catalytic residue enhancing the hydrolysis of the substrate. The crystal structure also shows that the two aromatic rings of the TSA are buried deep in the antigen-combining site and interact through hydrophobic interactions with Tyr H58 and Trp H100i. In addition to these perpendicular aromatic interactions, -stacking interactions between His H97 and the p-nitrophenyl group of the TSA are observed. Thus, the aromatic rings appear to be important for TSA binding. To deduce the structural basis for TSA recognition, the crystal structure of the unliganded 6D9 Fab was determined. The unliganded and liganded structures revealed that conformational changes in 6D9, especially at Trp H100i and His L27d, are induced by TSA binding. These combined thermodynamic and crystal structure analyses revealed the dynamic events underlying hydrolysis by the 6D9 and 9C10 catalytic antibodies.

factor of 22.3% and a free R-factor of 27.8% at 2.25 Å resolution. During the course of the present investigation, several discrepancies were noted between the electron density and the amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of both the light and the heavy chains. The 6D9 sequence of these regions was therefore redetermined by direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing, which revealed sequence errors in both chains. Consequently, the two TSA-complexed structures reported previously10 were re-refined with the new sequence data. This did not cause any large change in the structures, although it improved the refinement statistics. The crystal structure of unliganded 6D9 Fab was compared with the TSAcomplexed structure (Figure 2). The overall structure of the unliganded free form was similar to that of the two re-refined complexes, which in turn were essentially identical with the structures originally reported. The only notable changes were in a loop and the C-terminal region of the constant domain, both of which are unlikely to play any essential role in TSA binding. As in most Fab molecules, the CDR loops of 6D9 are used to bind to the TSA. The most prominent difference in the CDR loop structure between the unliganded and liganded structures is in the H3 loop. In the unliganded structure, the electron density corresponding to the loop is very weak and not interpretable, suggesting it is severely disordered. In contrast, the same loop in the

The structures of 6D9 in the unliganded form (sky blue) are superimposed on that of the liganded form (blue), form II, re-refined based on the data from the previous work.10 Binding of the TSA "pulls" the L1 loop through a hydrogen bond between the phosphate and the catalytic His L27d. The indole ring of Trp H100i in the unliganded form occupies a hydrophobic pocket, whereas it flips out to allow the TSA to bind in the pocket in the complex. For clarity, the hapten is represented as the transition-state analog 3.

202 liganded structure has clear electron density and plays an essential role in TSA recognition in the complex. These results suggest that the H3 loop has well-defined structure only when the TSA is present. Therefore, binding of the TSA will cause loss in conformational entropy, as discussed below. A large change in the temperature factors is also seen in the CDR L1 loop (Figure 3). The loop is apparently more mobile in the unliganded form, but the electron density is still interpretable, suggesting that the difference is not as large as in the H3 loop. The L1 loop contains the catalytic residue, His L27d. It is, therefore, very likely that the hydrogen bond between His L27d and the TSA stabilizes the structure of this loop in the complex (Figure 4(a)). In addition to the change in loop mobility, there are notable shifts in the positions of the L1 and H1 loops. These two loops are shifted by approximately 1.5 Å from the TSA binding pocket in the unliganded structure. The other CDR loops, as well as the framework regions, show similar movement, albeit much smaller in magnitude. There are two notable differences in the structures of individual residues in the hydrophobic antigencombining site of the liganded and unliganded antibodies. The first regards Trp H100i, at the bottom of the H3 loop (Figure 4(b)). Its indole sidechain points toward the molecular surface in the complex to accommodate the TSA, but in the unliganded structure, the side-chain rotates around the 1 angle to fill the hydrophobic binding pocket. The second difference regards residue His H97, also at the bottom of the H3 loop. Its imidazole directly stacks on the nitrobenzene moiety of the TSA in the complex, but points out from the binding pocket in the unliganded structure, although electron density for this residue is rather weak. This residue is located at the bottom of the H3 loop and thus contributes to the flexibility of this loop. The general and local changes described above result in considerable differences in the surface properties of liganded and unliganded 6D9. Binding of the TSA results in the loss of 246 Å2 polar (Ap) and 325 Å2 nonpolar (Anp) solvent accessible surface area of the protein. More than 80% (275 Å2) of the reduction of the Anp comes from the H-chain. Three aromatic residues (Tyr H58, His H97, and Trp H100i)

alone account for almost 80% (215 Å2) of this change and are directly involved in TSA binding. A similar large change in Anp occurs with Val L94, which also interacts directly with the TSA: it loses 56 Å2 of its nonpolar surface, which accounts almost entirely for the change in surface area in the L-chain. Interactions between the catalytic antibodies and the substrate ITC was used to investigate the substrate-binding thermodynamics of 6D9 and 9C10. The watersoluble substrate sub-Lys (4) was prepared (Figure 5) and its aqueous solubility improved by conjugating the Lys via a peptide bond to the carboxyl group of compound 5. The catalytic activities of 6D9 and 9C10 toward 4 were determined and are summarized in Table 1. The kinetic parameters are similar to those of compound 5, indicating that the modification had little effect on antibody binding. Because 6D9 and 9C10 hydrolyze chloramphenicol monoesters efficiently at high pH, antibody binding to sub-Lys was examined at low pH to determine whether binding experiments could be conducted under conditions of negligible catalysis. Fluorescence quenching analyses showed that the binding affinity of 6D9 toward sub-Lys at pH 6.0 (Kd = 51.5 M) is similar to the Km value determined at pH 8.0 (Table 1), suggesting that the mode of substrate binding at pH 6.0 is essentially identical with that at pH 8.0. Therefore, the ITC binding assays were conducted at pH 6.0, in the absence of appreciable catalysis.7 Figure 6(a) and (b) illustrates typical ITC profiles at 25 °C for the interactions of 6D9 and 9C10 with sub-Lys, respectively. An exothermic heat pulse was observed after each injection of sub-Lys. Because the

(c) and (d) The data points were obtained by integration of the peaks in (a) and (b), corrected for the dilution heat, and plotted against the molar ratio, sub-Lys/6D9 (c), and sub-Lys/9C10 (d). The data were fitted using a nonlinear least-squares method.

exothermic heat for 6D9 binding was small, a large amount of 6D9 was needed to analyze the binding thermodynamics. The small H for the interaction between 6D9 and sub-Lys was also supported by the fluorescence quenching analyses, in which the van't Hoff enthalpy change was determined to be - 2.34 kcal·mol- 1. Each exothermic peak was integrated, and the heat of dilution of sub-Lys was subtracted from the integrated values. The corrected heat was divided by the number of moles of sub-Lys injected, and the resulting values were plotted as a function of the molar ratio, as shown in Figure 6(c) and (d). The resultant data were best fit to a model for one binding site using a nonlinear least-squares method. The stoichiometry of binding, n, the binding constant, Ka, and the enthalpy change, H, were obtained from the fitted curve. The Gibbs free energy change, G, and the entropy change, S, were calculated from the equation G=­RT lnKa = H­TS. Because the magnitudes of G and S depend on concentration units for the standard state, the unitary entropy change, S°, and the unitary Gibbs free energy change, G°, were used after subtraction of the cratic part (Table 2). ITC measurements of the interaction of sub-Lys with 9C10 were performed at five temperatures, ranging from 20 to 35 °C (Table 2). This reaction showed a

strong temperature dependence for both H and TS°, which both compensated each other to make G° almost insensitive to temperature, as indicated in Figure 7. The heat capacity change, Cp, was - 0.21 kcal·mol- 1·K- 1 and was calculated from the linear fitting to the H values using the assumption that Cp is constant within the experimental temperature range. The temperature at which H changes sign was estimated to be - 53 °C. Therefore, under the experimental conditions used, the binding interaction between 9C10 and sub-Lys was enthalpically driven throughout the studied temperature range. In contrast, the interaction between 6D9 and sub-Lys was accompanied by both favorable enthalpy and entropy changes (Table 2). Interactions between the catalytic antibodies and the TSA The interactions between the catalytic antibodies and the TSA were analyzed by ITC at five temperatures, ranging from 20 to 35 °C. Typical ITC profiles at 25 °C are shown in Figure 8, and the thermodynamic parameters obtained are summarized in Table 3. Similar to the binding of sub-Lys to 9C10 described above, both H and TS° values for the binding of the TSA were temperature dependent

in an almost linear fashion. The Cp values were determined to be - 0.42 kcal·mol- 1·K- 1 for 6D9 binding and - 0.30 kcal·mol- 1·K- 1 for 9C10 binding. The temperature at which H changes sign was estimated to be 2.9 °C for 6D9 binding and - 38 °C for 9C10 binding. It should be noted that the binding affinity of 6D9 to the TSA was much higher than to sub-Lys because of favorable enthalpy changes. This is consistent with the kinetic results reported previously,12 indicating that the Ki value is much smaller than the Km value for 6D9-catalyzed hydrolyses of substrate, and that the G° between the substrate and the transition state is approximately 4.0 kcal·mol- 1·K- 1.

similar to the values previously calculated based on kcat/kuncat and KS/KTSA.7 These results indicate that the hydrolysis reaction is accelerated by the differential affinity of the transition state relative to the ground state. The crystal structural analysis suggested that transition-state stabilization in these antibody-catalyzed reactions is due mainly to a hydrogen bond between the oxyanion of the transition-state and the nitrogen () of the imidazole ring of His L27d in the CDR1 of the light chain.10 In this study, G° was analyzed by dividing it into H and S°. Thermodynamic analyses showed that the increased binding affinity to the TSA relative to the sub-Lys is mainly due to the favorable H (Table 4). Because H of a hydrogen bond in proteins is generally estimated to be less than 2.0 kcal·mol- 1,13 the large enthalpic difference of 6D9 (H values = 5.55 kcal·mol- 1) must involve molecular interactions other than the hydrogen bonding between the TSA and His L27d. Interestingly, the favorable H is compensated by the unfavorable S°, but the entropic contribution is very limited. As described above, the G° between binding to the TSA and the sub-Lys in 6D9 is larger than that in 9C10 (Table 4). This difference is mainly due to H. The larger H value of 6D9 relative to that of 9C10 is in good accordance with the larger kcat value of 6D9 (Tables 1 and 4). Such correlation between kcat and H suggests "enthalpic strain" in enzyme catalysis, which leads to destabilization of enzyme­substrate complexes.14 If a strain in the substrate is released in the transition state, it

Discussion
Catalytic antibodies are selected based on their affinities for TSAs of chemical reactions. However, strong affinity of a catalytic antibody for the transition state does not necessarily maximize the reaction rate (kcat). According to transition-state theory, the differential binding energy of catalytic antibodies for the transition state versus the ground state is a major determinant of rate enhancement. As a result, the ratio of the dissociation constant for the transition-state analog (KTSA) and the corresponding substrate (KS) should be equal to the rate enhancement (kcat/kuncat = KS/KTSA). This theoretical relationship can be visualized from the crystal structure of the 6D9­TSA complex.10 In the complex, the His L27d side-chain is positioned to make a hydrogen bond to the phosphonate oxygen of the TSA, which plays an important role in stabilizing the tetrahedral transition state. To obtain a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism of antibodies, thermodynamic analyses of the binding of two catalytic antibodies, 6D9 and 9C10, with the TSA and the substrate were examined. The differences between the interaction of sub-Lys and TSA for 6D9 and 9C10 at 25 °C are summarized in Table 4. The G° values of 6D9 and 9C10 are 4.57 and 1.31 kcal·mol- 1, respectively, and both are

contributes to enhancing the value for kcat, but not for kcat/Km. This change was actually observed in the kcat and Km for 9C10 and 6D9 (Table 1). One of the factors contributing to enthalpic strain may be a conformational change in the substrate. In the structure of the 6D9­TSA complex, the TSA has a folded conformation, and the two aromatic rings are buried deep in the antigen-combining site through aromatic­aromatic interactions with Trp H100i and Tyr H58. The conformation of the bound TSA suggests that the antibody binds the substrate to change the conformation of the ester moiety to a thermodynamically unstable twisted conformation. The thermodynamically stable conformation of the ester bond is the planar Z form.15 Thus, the conformational change of the ester moiety to the twisted conformation probably results in the experimentally-observed weak binding affinity of the substrate for 6D9 (Table 2). A comparison of the amino acid sequences between 6D9 and 9C10 suggests the different catalytic activity between them. As shown in Figure 9, the H3 loop of 9C10 is five residues shorter than that of 6D9 and is missing Trp H100i, the key residue for the TSA binding in 6D9.12 As described above, in the 6D9­TSA complex, the two aromatic rings of the TSA are stacked in association with Trp H100i and Tyr H58,10 suggesting that these residues contribute to the conformational strain on the substrate. Thus, 9C10 lacks the important aromatic­aromatic interaction, resulting in decreased catalytic activity. This explanation for the catalytic activity is supported by the difference of the thermodynamic property between 6D9 and 9C10 (Table 3). The lack of aromatic­aromatic interaction decreases the total

hydrophobic interaction of 9C10 with TSA, which is in good correlation with the more negative S° value and the less negative Cp value, as described below. In most antigen­antibody interactions, H is favorable and S° is unfavorable, as observed in the binding of 9C10.16 The favorable S° observed in the binding of 6D9 provides insights into the mechanism of binding. In general, a negative S° is due to hydrogen bond formation, a decrease in the number of isoenergetic conformations, and a decrease in soft internal vibrational modes, while a positive S° is due to burial of electrostatic charges and hydrophobic groups.17 The crystal structures of 6D9 Fab with and without TSA showed that conformational entropy decreases substantially upon binding, and a large number of hydrophobic interactions form in the deep pocket of the antigencombining site. Therefore, the favorable entropic contribution probably originates mainly from the hydrophobic effect (i.e., dehydration), which can overcome the decrease in conformational entropy. Hydration changes due to biomolecular interachyd tions involving specific association events, Cp , are usually estimated from the corresponding change of the solvent-accessible polar (Ap ) and nonpolar (Anp ) surface areas of both molecules, based upon empirical protein folding thermodynamics:18 DChyd cð0:32F0:04ÞDAnp þ ðÀ0:14F0:04ÞDAp : ð1Þ p Murphy and Freire have derived a similar equation19: DChyd cð0:45F0:02ÞDAnp þ ðÀ0:26F0:03ÞDAp : ð2Þ p
hyd The Cp values calculated using Equations (1) and (2) for the unliganded and TSA-complexed crystal structures of 6D9 Fab are - 0.042 and - 0.060 kcal·mol- 1· K- 1, respectively, much less than the experimental value, -0.42 kcal·mol- 1·K- 1. Although the present A calculation was based on the assumption that the solvent accessible surface area of the disordered H3 loop in the unliganded form is hyd zero, the calculated Cp value could be underestimated.

the experimental and calculated values, while others showed disagreement. Underestimation of the experimentally determined Cp value may be mainly due to the involvement of water molecules,22,26,27 which either cannot be detected or are underestimated from the crystal structural analysis. Several crystal structural analyses including ours indicated that the antibodies catalyze the reactions by straining or distorting the bound substrates toward the transition states.10,28­30 The present analyses revealed the thermodynamic origin of antibody-catalyzed hydrolysis from the viewpoint of transition-state stabilization. Antibody 6D9 binds the substrate mainly through hydrophobic interactions with the two aromatic rings to change the conformation of the ester moiety to a thermodynamically unstable twisted conformation. Comparison of the thermodynamics of 6D9 and 9C10, presented here, shows that local hydrophobic contacts are critical for enthalpic strain, providing more efficient catalysis. The results are, to our knowledge, the first to show enthalpic strain by analyzing equilibrium thermodynamics, and this is one of the advantages of using catalytic antibodies in which both substrates and TSAs are available to study catalytic mechanisms.

parameters a = 86.3 Å, b = 80.8 Å, and c = 89.3 Å). The asymmetric unit contains one Fab molecule. Diffraction data were collected with an image plate mounted on a rotating anode at 100 K. A total of 112,371 diffractions were collected in the resolution range of 40­2.25 Å and were merged into 22,833 unique reflections (redundancy of 4.9). This corresponds to 95.6% of those theoretically possible, with an Rsym of 4.1%. Structure determination and refinement of the unliganded form The structure of unliganded 6D9 was determined by molecular replacement using the program AMORE,32 using the 6D9 structure from the complex (Protein Data Bank entry code 1hyx) as the search model. Both the rotation and the translation searches gave a definitive solution. The structure was refined using the program CNS33 to an R-factor of 22.3% (free R-factor = 27.8%) against 22,833 reflections in the working data set between 15 and 2.25 Å. More statistics are given in Table 5. Re-refinement of the complex structures The structure of 6D9 complexed with the TSA in two crystal forms10 (referred to as "form I" and "form II") were re-refined against the original diffraction data with the newly determined sequence. The new models were refined to R-factors of 18.7 and 20.7% (free R-factors of 24.6 and 24.6%) in the resolution range of 6.0­1.8 Å and 40.0­1.7 Å for forms I and II, respectively.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization of the unliganded form 6D9 Fab was prepared as previously reported.31 The unliganded form of the 6D9 Fab was crystallized in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.7), 16% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Although these are very similar conditions to that used to produce the TSA complex,10 the spacegroup was different (P212121 with cell

Hydrolytic activity assay Reactions were initiated by adding 10 l of a stock solution of substrate in dimethylsulfoxide to 90 l of antibody solution in 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. Hydrolysis rates were measured by HPLC detection of the products with 10-l injections of the reaction mixture. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Hitachi L6200 unit equipped with a Hitachi L4000 UV detector, using an YMC-ODS-AM-303 column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) eluted with acetonitrile/aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%, 30:70) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with detection at 278 nm. The retention time of the product alcohol was 6.4 min. Initial rates were determined from the linear range of the rate. The observed rate was corrected for the uncatalyzed rate of hydrolysis in the absence of antibody. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were determined by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the initial rate against substrate concentration to a hyperbolic curve described by the Michaelis­Menten equation.3 v ¼ kcat ½Ab½S=ðKm þ ½SÞ ð3Þ

In this equation, v is the initial velocity, [Ab] is the active site concentration of the antibody, and [S] is the substrate concentration. Fluorescence quenching analyses All fluorescence experiments were carried out with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer. Titration of the antibody was carried out by adding small aliquots (20 l) of inhibitor (1­10 mM) to 2 ml of the antibody solution in 50 mM NaPi, pH 6.0. The 3-ml cuvette was thermostabilized at 15, 25, 35, and 45 °C and equipped with a

208
magnetic stirrer. Tryptophan was excited at 295 nm and emission was recorded at 340 nm. Dissociation constants were determined as previously reported.34 Isothermal titration calorimetry Isothermal titration calorimetric experiments were carried out on a MicroCal MCS calorimeter interfaced with a microcomputer. All samples were in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) to prevent hydrolysis of the substrate, and all solutions were thoroughly degassed using the degassing equipment provided with the instrument. Antigen, sub-Lys, or TSA solution was titrated into the antibody solution using a 100-l syringe. Each titration consisted of a preliminary 2-l injection followed by 19 subsequent 5-l additions, which were performed over 10s periods at 240-s intervals. The heat for each injection was subtracted from the dilution heat of the titrant, measured by injecting the antigen solution into buffer alone. Each corrected heat was divided by the moles of antigen injected. Data were analyzed using the Origin software supplied by MicroCal. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates of the unliganded and two complexed forms were submitted to the Protein Data Bank (entry ID: 2dtm, 2dqt, and 2dqu).
