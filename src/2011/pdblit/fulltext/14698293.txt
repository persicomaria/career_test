The disaccharide sucrose and the cleavage products glucose and fructose are the central molecules for carbohydrate translocation, metabolism and sensing in higher plants. Invertases mediate the hydrolytic cleavage of sucrose into the hexose monomers. Plants possess three types of invertases, which are located in the apoplast, the cytoplasm and the vacuole, respectively. It has become evident that extracellular and vacuolar invertase isoenzymes are key metabolic enzymes that are involved in various aspects of the plant life cycle and the response of the plant to environmental stimuli because their substrates and reaction products are both nutrients and signal molecules. Invertases, alone or in combination with plant hormones, can regulate many aspects of the growth and development of plants from gene expression to longdistance nutrient allocation and are involved in regulating carbohydrate partitioning, developmental processes, hormone responses and biotic and abiotic interactions. Carbon autotrophy is the most prominent feature of higher plants and the non-reducing disaccharide sucrose plays a central role in plant metabolism. Carbohydrates are synthesized in source leaves and translocated to sink tissues in most species in the form of sucrose to sustain heterotrophic metabolism and growth, or to be stored as sucrose or starch. Growth and development of plants is accompanied by changes in source­sink relations. Furthermore, plants, as sessile life forms, have developed regulatory mechanisms that enable a flexible response with respect to assimilate partitioning to specific requirements of the habitat such as biotic and abiotic stress factors. In recent years it has become evident that sugars, notably sucrose and its cleavage products, are important metabolic signals that affect the expression of different classes of genes [1,2] and are involved in the regulation of development [3]. Thus sucrose metabolism, partitioning and sensing is vital for all stages of the plant life cycle. To use sucrose as a carbon and energy source requires the cleavage of the a1-b2-glycosidic bond, which can be catalysed by two different enzymes. The reversible cleavage by the glycosyltransferase sucrose synthase to UDP-glucose and fructose (EC 2.4.1.13) conserves the bond energy. By contrast, invertases (EC 3.2.1.26, b-fructosidase, b-fructofuranosidase) catalyse the irreversible hydrolyses to glucose and fructose. The importance of invertases was

only recognized when molecular studies were initiated in the early 1990s [4­6]; thereafter, invertases attracted a lot of attention and to date there are O300 invertase sequences in the databases, representing O200 different isoenzymes from w50 plant species. A still-growing number of studies have revealed that invertases play a crucial role in various aspects of plant growth and development. The current knowledge about this isoenzyme family, with a special focus on key findings of recent years is reviewed here. Further detailed information is available in Refs [7­10]. Plants possess three types of invertase isoenzymes Based on their solubility, subcellular localization, pH-optima and isoelectric point, three different types of invertase isoenzymes can be distinguished: vacuolar (Inv-V), cell wall bound (Inv-CW) and neutral (Inv-N) invertases (Figure 1; Table 1). Inv-Vs and Inv-CWs have similar enzymatic and biochemical properties and share a high degree of overall sequence homology and two conserved amino acid motifs. Both types of invertases are b-fructofuranosidases, which have an acidic pH optimum and are also able to accept other fructofuranosides such as stachyose and raffinose as a substrate but with significantly reduced cleavage efficiency. Inv-Vs and Inv-CWs are glycoproteins; it has been demonstrated that inhibition of glycosylation results in rapid degradation of an Inv-CW [11]. Invertase activity is inhibited by sulfhydryl-group blocking agents. The crucial function of conserved cysteine residues in Inv-CW activity has been proven by mutational analyses [12]. Invertase isoenzymes are encoded by small gene families comprising up to two (Inv-Vs) and six (Inv-CWs) members, respectively. The genomic organization and intron­exon structure seems to be conserved between monocot and dicot invertase genes. A special feature is the presence of a mini exon of only nine nucleotides that was found in all but one of the invertase genes [13,14]. It encodes three amino acids of the conserved N-DPN-G/A box that spans three exons and is found in invertases from plants, bacteria and yeasts. The genomic tandem arrangement of Inv-CWs from potato and tomato seems to be conserved in other species [15,16] and a transposon insertion has been identified in the first, long intron (up to 2400 bps) of an Inv-V of carrot [17] and an Inv-CW from tomato (R. Proels and T. Roitsch, unpublished). Inv-Vs, also labelled as soluble acidic invertases, are characterized by an acidic pH optimum (pH 5.0­5.5) and

Figure 1. Subcellular localization of invertase isoenzymes and phloem unloading pathways. Sucrose can be hydrolysed by different invertase isoenzymes depending on the mechanism of the phloem unloading pathway in the sink tissue. In symplastically isolated tissues, sucrose is unloaded from the sieve elements of the phloem into the apoplast by an assumed efflux sucrose transporter (eST); there the disaccharide can be cleaved by an extracellular invertase (Inv-CW) bound to the cell wall and the resulting hexoses will be transported into the sink cell by a hexose transporter (HT). Alternatively sucrose can be directly transported into the sink cell by a sucrose transporter (ST). Sucrose unloaded in the sink cell, either through the apoplasm or via plasmodesmata, can be cleaved in the cytosol by neutral invertase (Inv-N) or sucrose synthase, or in the vacuole by vacuolar invertase (Inv-V). The hexoses generated by the activity of the sucrose-cleaving enzymes are not only substrates for heterotrophic growth but also function as regulators of gene expression. Coordinated regulation by metabolic stimuli has been shown for photosynthesis, sink metabolism and defence responses. Inv-CWs play a special role because any stimulus up-regulating the activity will decrease the local sucrose concentration in the sink-tissue and thus increase the sink-strength, providing a feed-forward mechanism for maintaining and amplifying diverse stimuli to enhance the flow of assimilates.

are localized in the vacuole [18]. Inv-Vs have N-terminal extensions unlike Inv-CWs sequences [8]. They determine the level of sucrose stored in the vacuole and remobilization of sucrose for metabolic processes. A well-established function is the regulation of the sugar balance in fruit tissues and mature tubers [19­21]. Inv-CWs, also referred to as extracellular, apoplasmic, periplasmic or free-space invertases, are characterized by a low pH-optimum (pH 3.5­5.0), a high isoelectric point and are ionically bound to the cell wall. As originally suggested by Walter Eschrich [22], Inv-CWs cleave sucrose leaked or transported by an assumed efflux sucrose transporter from the sieve elements of the phloem into the apoplast. The cleavage products are then transported into the sink cells by hexose transporters. The functional linkage of hexose transporters and Inv-CWs [23] is supported by a tissue-specific co-expression [24,25] and coordinated regulation [26,27]. Whereas an

apoplasmic pathway is required for symplasmically isolated cells such as pollen and guard cells, it has become clear that Inv-CWs are also important in sink tissue with symplasmic connections. Within the conserved WECP/V amino acid motif, all vacuolar invertases posses a valine residue, whereas all extracellular (periplasmatic) invertases are characterized by a proline residue. This conserved single amino acid difference determines the distinctly more-acidic pH-optimum of Inv-CWs and their substrate specificity [28]. A few putative Inv-CWs have been cloned that are characterized by an acidic pI, supporting the idea of a second type of Inv-CW that is not ionically bound to the cell wall [29­31]. The third type of invertases, Inv-Ns, are also known as alkaline or cytoplasmic invertases because of their pH-optima (between pH 6.8 and 8.0) and subcellular localization.

function is available because the generally low enzyme activity is rapidly lost and only a few Inv-Ns have been cloned and characterized. In contrast to the acidic invertases they are not glycosylated and preferentially or solely hydrolyse sucrose and thus are not fructofuranosidases. The activity is strongly inhibited by the cleavage products but is not affected by heavy metals, which also suggests a markedly different catalytic site. The few available sequences of Inv-Ns are highly homologous, with a high degree of conservation in the C-terminal part, but do show low sequence homology with Inv-Vs and Inv-CWs. Inv-Ns have only been found in cyanobacteria and plants and it has been suggested that modern plant Inv-Ns might have originated from an orthologous prokaryotic gene after endosymbiosis [32]. Plant invertases are under the control of a variety of regulatory mechanisms The dominant mechanism that determines the steadystate level of invertases is a highly responsive transcriptional regulation mechanism. This applies both to the tissue and developmental specific expression and the regulation by diverse external and internal stimuli. The internal stimuli include sugars that are generated by the direct or indirect effect of their own expression. Notably, different Inv-CWs are metabolically induced by glucose, which provides a positive feed-forward mechanism that is also relevant for regulation by other stimuli: the up-regulation of an Inv-CW by any kind of stimulus can be maintained or amplified via the sugar signal generated by the elevated invertase activity to further enhance the flow of assimilates (Figure 1) (see detailed discussion in Ref. [10]). Different family members show contrasting responses to a particular stimulus and the expression of the same gene can differ markedly in various tissues. Different further mechanisms involved in the regulation of invertase expression or activity have been identified, including differential transcript formation [33], exon skipping [34], inhibition by proteinaceous inhibitors [35], and a novel mechanism that controls compartmentalization and breakdown [36]. The range of regulatory mechanisms supports the idea that invertases play a crucial role in plant metabolism. Function in carbohydrate partitioning Long-distance transport of assimilates from source leaves into sink organs is driven by differences in osmotic potentials. Thus, cleavage of sucrose by Inv-CW at the site of phloem unloading and metabolization of the cleavage products controls the sink strength to attract sucrose [22]. The essential role of Inv-CWs in regulating phloem unloading and sink strength has been analysed in transgenic carrot plants with antisense suppression of Inv-CW under the control of the 35S-CaMV promoter dominantly active in the carrot tap roots. The resulting lowered carbohydrate content in roots and increased leaf-to-root ratio of these plants demonstrates the important function of Inv-CWs in sucrose partitioning [37]. The essential function of Inv-CWs in carbohydrate supply to symplastically isolated pollen is evident from antisense repression of Inv-CW Nin88, which is specifically expressed in the tapetum and pollen of tobacco [38].
www.sciencedirect.com

Tissue-specific suppression of Nin88 under the control of its own promoter resulted in a developmental block during early stages of pollen development; the different transgenic lines revealed the correlation between reduction in enzymatic activity and germination efficiency. Pollen of the antisense lines was arrested in the unicellular microspore stage when the wild-type pollen showed the highest Inv-CW activity. The pollen showed a distorted and invaginated morphology indicating a reduced amount of intracellular material, which suggests a block of assimilate supply (Figure 2). Moreover, in vitro maturation assays showed that the developmental arrest could only be partly rescued by exogenous supply of glucose or sucrose [39], suggesting that the function of Inv-CW is not only to provide carbohydrates to sustain heterotrophic growth but also to create a delicate, finely tuned balance between the sucrose and the hexose sugars required as metabolic signals to regulate pollen development. The first map-based cloned quantitative trait locus determining total soluble solutes of tomato fruits (brix), an important quality parameter, turned out to be part of an invertase gene previously identified [40]. Roles of invertases in plant development Among the processes of plant development regulated by plant invertases, the greatest progress in recent years has been in understanding the role of invertases in early seed development, particularly in the transfer of photoassimilates from maternal cells to the developing embryo. The first evidence for a crucial function of an invertases-mediated unloading process and the importance of a physiological gradient during early seed development was obtained by characterizing the maize mutant miniature-1 (mn-1), which is deficient in an Inv-CW [5]. During the development of the mn-1 kernels the low invertase activity in the basal part of the endosperm results in a withdrawal of the maternal cells in the region of the palentochalazal, producing a gap between the pedicel and the basal part of the endosperm and interrupting the transport of assimilates to the endosperm. The largest body of evidence for a role of invertases in seed development has been obtained by studying the metabolism of sucrose in the early development of legume seeds [3,41]. In developing legume seeds the embryo is symplastically isolated from the surrounding seed coat. In the pre-storage phase of developing Vicia faba seeds, high levels of hexoses in the cotyledons and apoplasmic endospermal space are correlated with Inv-CW activity corresponding to an Inv-CW expressed in the thin-walled parenchyma of the seed coat, the site of assimilate unloading into the apoplast. The hydrolysis of sucrose by this Inv-CW contributes to establishing sink strength in young seeds. The decrease in Inv-CW activity during developmentally regulated degradation of the thin-walled parenchyma initiates the storage phase. The correlation between Inv-CW activity, high hexose status and mitotic activity was also evident from the analyses of genotypes of V. faba differing in seed weight and expression of yeastderived invertase in the apoplast of maturing embryos of Vicia narbonensis. The ability of the embryo to maintain mitotic activity is mediated by metabolic signals

also as signals within defined tissues to maintain a distinct stage of differentiation or to proceed within the developmental programme, indicating that invertases play a crucial role in generating the metabolic signals. This is

Cytokinins have been shown to induce one of the D-type cyclins, CycD3, controlling the transition between the G1 and S phase of the cell cycle, a central control point for cell proliferation (red arrow) [47,48]. The increase of cell wall bound invertases (Inv-CWs) induced by cytokinins enhances the sink strength increasing the flow of assimilates to sink tissue. In addition, both sucrose and glucose (Glc) induce two of the D-type cyclins, CycD2 and CycD3 [48,49], resulting in cell proliferation and an increase in sink size. As a result of the increase in sink size and sink strength, growth and eventually differentiation of sink tissue proceeds.

supported by cytometrical studies of maize mn-1 mutant that demonstrate that the Inv-CW deficiency in the endosperm correlates with reduced mitotic activity [42]. More recently, the role of sugars in cereal seed development has been analysed. In barley seeds, assimilates are released in the apoplasmic endospermal cavity by the nucellar projections. Hexose contents in the filial tissues of barley seeds are maximal when internal cell divisions and elongation processes take place; these are related to the expression of an isoform of Inv-CW localized in the endospermal transfer cell layers flanking the nucellar projection as well as the outermost area of the nucellar projection [25,43]. Invertase links hormone response to primary metabolism Invertases are regulated by the full set of phytohormones [10], in most cases the effect is related to an increased demand of carbohydrates for hormone-promoted growth. These findings link primary metabolism to phytohormone action and reveal the importance of elucidating the relationship between invertases and phytohormones in unravelling the molecular mechanisms of the physiological hormone responses. It has been reported that the asymmetric increase in acid invertase activity induced by auxin redistribution in maize pulvinal cells has an essential role in producing an asymmetrical accumulation of hexoses leading to the differential growth of cells characteristic of gravitropic responses [44], providing further evidence for a link between invertase action and cell proliferation (Figure 3). A relationship between cytokinins and invertase function is supported by the coordinated induction of Inv-CW and hexose transporters of Chenopodium rubrum by cytokinins, resulting in a higher uptake of hexose sugars [45]. The importance of Inv-CWs for the delay of leaf senescence by cytokinins has been established in transgenic plants expressing an Inv-CW under the control of the senescence-induced SAG12 promoter [46]. The resulting delay of senescence indicates that the effect of cytokinins can be substituted by this metabolic enzyme. Likewise, the localized induction of an Inv-CW by a chemically inducible promoter results in ectopic delay of senescence similar to the green islands of autumn leaves (Figure 4). A causal relationship between cytokinins and Inv-CW for the delay of senescence has been established in transgenic plants that allowed inhibition of extracellular invertase in the presence of cytokinins by an invertase inhibitor. Cytokinins fail to delay senescence under conditions when invertase activity is inhibited, showing that nutrient mobilization via an extracellular invertase is an essential component of the underlying mechanism. These findings provide the molecular basis for the green islands, a naturally occurring delay of senescence owing to the production of cytokinins by pathogens and herbivores [47]. This study suggests that Inv-CW could also be involved in other cytokinin-mediated responses. The active growth of tissues induced by cytokinins depends on the function of the cell division cycle. It has been shown that D-type cyclins, required for the transition between G1 and S phase [48], are regulated by sugars and by

cytokinins [49,50], indicating an important link between cytokinin, sugar status and the initiation of cell division. The link between a high Inv-CW activity and the high resulting hexose levels to a high mitotic activity has been described previously for the pre-storage phase of legume seeds [3]. As discussed above, the up-regulation of Inv-CW by cytokinins has a dual function, providing carbohydrates to the actively growing tissues and generating a metabolic signal to stimulate the cell cycle [44]. This mechanism ensures that cell proliferation is only initiated when sufficient carbohydrates are available to satisfy the increased demand for nutrients by the actively dividing cells (Figure 3). The relationship between brassinosteroid-mediated growth responses and carbohydrate partitioning is demonstrated by the specific induction of a particular Inv-CW isoform by brassinosteroids in tomato suspension culture cells. Analysis of the seedlings has revealed that the brassinosteroid-induced growth responses of the hypocotyl elongation zone correlates with a tissue-specific induction of Lin6 mRNA [51]. Invertases are involved in stress responses Most studies on the effect of abiotic stresses on invertase activity address the effect of drought stress on reproductive development. The induction of male sterility by water deficit during meiosis was shown to correlate with a decreased Inv-V activity in wheat, supporting a crucial function of Inv-V and thus of the carbohydrate supply for this stress response [52]. A reduced Inv-V activity has also

been reported for drought-stressed young maize ovaries. The correlation between low Inv-V activity and reduced seed yield suggests that soluble invertases also play a role in providing hexose sugars to support cell division during the pre-storage phase. The decrease in Inv-V activity could also affect the post-phloem transfer of sucrose in maternal tissues and the generation of a hexose-based turgor pressure for cell expansion during growth and development [53]. The predominant role of an Inv-V in early stages of maize kernel development was further substantiated by the finding that the reduction of Irv2 localized in the perianth and adhering to the kernels as a result of drought stress could result in reduced assimilate import into the grain [54]. An induction of Irv2 in response to water stress was observed in leaves [55], suggesting different modes of transcriptional regulation and physiological significances in both organs. ABA was shown to be involved in mediating the repression of Ivr2 expression in the source organ [56]. In young maize seedlings, hypoxic and anoxic conditions induce a rapid repression of the Inv-V gene expression, whereas the levels of sucrose synthase remain constant. The decreased invertase to sucrose synthase ratio has an important implication both for the conservation of carbon and ATP and for the reduction of a hexosebased sugar signalling system [57]. When plants are subjected to pathogen invasion, a complex defence response is induced that involves the activation of many genes. The increased respiratory activity requires an enhanced flow of carbohydrates that could be satisfied by an increased invertase activity in this biotic interaction. Accordingly, the induction of Inv-CWs by elicitors, wounding, pathogen infection and other biotic stress-related stimuli has been shown in suspension cultures [58,59] and plants [4,10,60,61] of various species. Inv-CW is the central part of a mechanism for coordinated regulation of photosynthesis, sink metabolism and defence responses in response to both sugars and stressrelated stimuli. The original findings obtained with suspension cultures [58,59] were extended to plants infected by necrotrophic fungi and biotrophic bacteria [61], respectively. Photoautotrophic cell cultures have proven to be a useful tool to discriminate between sugar and defence responses [62] and to demonstrate that sugars and stress-related stimuli independently activate different signal transduction pathways. Sugars might function as an extracellular indicator of pathogen infection, as also suggested by the effect of sucrose isomers on Inv-CW [59], but the corresponding genes are also directly regulated by the stress stimuli. Inv-CWs could have a dual function, providing carbohydrates to maintain sink metabolism and keeping the system induced by elevated sugar concentrations (Figure 1) [10], but the corresponding genes are also directly regulated by the stress stimuli. Conclusions and future prospects The use of different functional approaches has led to an improvement in our knowledge of invertase function in plant growth and development. However, the use of constitutive promoters suffered from pleiotrophic effects [6,37]. By contrast, the use of tissue- and developmentalwww.sciencedirect.com

specific promoters [38,46] and an inducible promoter system [46] are proving to be promising tools for future studies. These approaches should be complemented by future analyses of invertase knock-out mutants that have been isolated [63]. Although invertase inhibitor proteins have been demonstrated in various species and have been cloned from monocot and dicot species [35], the physiological function of the inhibition of invertases by these proteins in vivo is still limited [64]. Another question that remains to be answered is the physiological significance of the intriguing sequence homology between invertases and fructan biosynthetic and degrading enzymes. Fructosyltransferases (FT) share a high degree of sequence homology and sucrolytic activity with Inv-Vs [65], whereas fructan exohydrolases (FEH) are highly homologous to Inv-CWs but have negligible invertase activity [66], supporting an evolutionary relationship. Several recent studies indicate that invertases might be involved in a variety of additional processes that include secondary product formation [67,68], plant­herbivore interactions [69], salt stress responses [70,71], source leaf function [72] and symbiotic interactions such as mycorrhiza [73] and plant­rhizobium interactions [74]. These findings support the suggestion that invertases have a role in additional aspects of plant metabolism and development, although future studies will be required to elucidate the physiological significance in these systems. Now that methods have become available that allow us to monitor carbohydrate fluxes or the sink status by noninvasive techniques such as labelling with the short-lived 11 C-isotope [75], NMR [76] or chlorophyll fluorescence imaging [77], it is important to verify whether changes in invertase expression are indeed transformed into corresponding changes of the metabolic state and carbon fluxes. Finally, the biotechnological potential of interfering with invertase function needs to be further explored. One application is the upregulation of sink strength to increase crop yield [78], fruit quality [40], or secondary product formation [78]. Another application is the engineering of male sterility by antisense inhibition of Inv-CWs activity in anthers for hybrid seed production or as a biological safety mechanism to avoid outcrossing of transgenes [38]. Invertases are no longer considered to be old fashioned and boring enzymes. Increased attention from various plant subdisciplines should help to spur future progress in unravelling the complexity of physiological roles of the different invertase isoenzymes and it can be speculated that there are still a few surprises left to discover.
