Cooperative zinc binding in a staphylococcal enterotoxin A mutant mimics the SEA-MHC class II interaction
Received: 2 February 2001 / Accepted: 10 April 2001 / Published online: 9 June 2001 Ó SBIC 2001

Abstract The structure of a mutant form of staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) has been determined to Ê 2.1 A resolution. The studied SEA substitution H187®A187 (SEAH187A) leads to an almost 10-fold reduction of the binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. H187 is important for this interaction since it coordinates Zn2+. The zinc ion is thought to hold MHC class II and SEA together in a complex. Interestingly, only one of two molecules in the asymmetric unit binds Zn2+. H225, D227, a water molecule, and H44 from a symmetry-related molecule ligate Zn2+. The symmetry-related histidine is necessary for this substituted Zn2+ site to bind to Zn2+ at low zinc concentration (no Zn2+ added). Since a water molecule replaces the missing H187, H44 binds Zn2+ at the position where bH81 from MHC class II probably will bind. Dynamic light scattering analysis reveals that in solution as well as in the crystal lattice the SEAH187A mutant forms aggregates. The substitution per se does not cause aggregation since wild-type SEA also forms aggregates. Addition of EDTA reduces the size of the aggregates, indicating a cross-linking function of Zn2+. In agreement with the biological function, the aggregation is weak (i.e. not revealed by gel ®ltration) and non-speci®c.

Introduction
Zn2+ is present in blood plasma at a concentration of 12±16 lM [1]. It is important for transcription and replication as well as for the immune system [2]. Some bacteria make use of Zn2+ to impair the immune system of their hosts. Bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes produce Zn2+-binding proteins as a strategy to attach to vital components in the immune system. Some of the staphylococcal and streptococcal enterotoxins belong to this category of proteins and trigger the immune system by cross-linking major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and T-cell receptors (TcRs) in an antigen-independent manner. Unlike normal antigens, these proteins are bound to MHC class II as intact and unprocessed proteins. They were denoted superantigen (SAgs), referring to the fact that as many as 5±30% of all TcRs recognize this complex between the SAg and MHC class II [3]. The staphylococcal enterotoxins SEA, SED, SEE and SEH, together with the streptococcal pyogenic exotoxins SPE-C, SPE-G and SPE-H and streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z (SMEZ), all exhibit a Zn2+-dependent binding to MHC class II [4, 5, 6, 7]. The SEA toxin studied here is the major cause of Gram-positive septic shock and food poisoning in humans [8]. The wild-type SEA structure displays the common SAg fold with two distinct domains: one N-terminal b-barrel and a C-terminal b-grasp motif [9, 10]. Altogether, SEA has two

758

MHC class II binding sites, one medium anity Zn2+dependent binding site (Kd100 nM [11]) in the Cterminal domain and a low-anity binding site (Kd10 lM [11]) in the N-terminal domain [4, 11, 12, 13]. The zinc-loaded SEA structure shows that H187, H225 and D227 coordinate Zn2+ [10]. Mutagenesis experiments on MHC class II molecules, human leucocyte antigen DR1 (HLA-DR1), reveal that H81 on the b-chain of MHC class II (bH81) is the most important amino acid in the interaction of HLA-DR1 with SEA [14, 15]. A plausible, though not con®rmed, hypothesis is that the zinc ion is directly involved in the interface between the superantigen and MHC class II molecule. The SEAH187A mutant was produced in order to obtain a variant of SEA with moderately reduced MHC class II binding properties and was found to exhibit an almost 10-fold reduction in MHC class II binding as compared to wild-type SEA [11]. Our experiments show that this SEA mutant retains a correct three-dimensional fold and that a decrease in Zn2+ anity explains the reduced anity for MHC class II. We also provide data supporting a model in which a histidine from a neighboring SEAH187A molecule by mimicking the MHC class II-SEA interaction stabilizes the Zn2+ binding of SEAH187A in the crystal as well as in solution.

pH 8.0 and mixed with equal amounts of reservoir solution. The reservoir contained 15% w/v polyethylene glycol 8000, 100± 200 mM LiSO4 and 100 mM Pipes buer at pH 6.0. Crystals apÊ peared after 3 weeks to 3 months. Data were collected to 2.1 A resolution from a 0.2´0.2´0.3 mm crystal using a RU 200BEH Rigaku rotating anode operating at 50 kV and 90 mA and a 30 cm diameter imaging plate detector (MAR research system). The data were processed with the XDS program [16] and scaled with the XSCALE program (Table 1). Structure determination and re®nement The structure was solved using the molecular replacement technique with wild-type SEA as a model [9] and the program AMORE [17]. Two molecules per asymmetric unit were found, which resulted in an R-factor of 39% and a correlation coecient of 0.58. The re®nement was carried out using XPLOR version 3.1 [18] and the maps were ®tted using the O program [19]. The initial Ê B-factors were set to 25 A2 and rigid body re®nement was folÊ lowed by positional and B-group re®nement between 8 and 2.5 A, resulting in an R-factor of 0.295 and a free R-factor of 0.36. A possible Zn2+ in the zinc site of molecule A, giving rise to an 11r peak above the mean value of the Fobs±Fcalc electron density, was included in the model. A bulk solvent correction term was applied and the re®nement was carried out with data between 20 and Ê 2.1 A resolution with positional and individual B-factor re®nement. Individual B-factor re®nement of Zn2+ revealed a high Ê B-factor (150 A2), indicating either high mobility of the inserted Zn2+, a not fully occupied site, or an ion with a lesser number of electrons. The ion is probably Zn2+, since it exhibits typical Ê binding distances of 1.8±2.3 A, a coordination number of 4, and types of ligands (two histidines) for Zn2+. Instead, the occupancy Ê of Zn2+ was reduced to 0.6 and a B-factor of 23 A2 was obtained. Water molecules were included at an R-factor of 0.265 and a free R-factor of 0.295. Peaks above 3r in the Fobs±Fcalc maps were included as waters if exhibiting hydrogen bonds to protein atoms or other water molecules. The ®nal model includes amino acids 10±233 in molecule A, amino acids 8±233 in molecule B, the Zn2+, one SO42± and 242 water molecules. The SEAH187A structures exhibit good geometry (Table 1) and around 88% of the residues

To con®rm the presence of Zn2+, one crystal was soaked in reservoir solution with 10 mM Zn2+ for 24 h and data were colÊ lected to 2.9 A (Table 1). After rigid body re®nement of the re®ned low Zn2+ SEAH187A molecules using CNS [21], the highest positive peaks (19 and 16r) in the Fobs±Fcalc map were found in the Zn2+ sites. The Zn2+ ions were included and simulated annealing with Ê B-factors set to 25 A2 was followed by B-group re®nement. OcÊ cupancy re®nement of the Zn2+ ions (B-values of 36.8 A2) was used to show that the Zn2+ sites are fully occupied. At this stage the free R-factor was 0.281 and the R-factor was 0.208. No attempts were made to further re®ne the structure. Final coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 1I4H. Dynamic light scattering measurements Data were obtained with the Dyna Pro-801 DLS instrument (Protein Solutions) on solutions with a protein concentration of 2 mg/mL and 20 mM tricine, pH 8.0. The SEA and SEAH187A protein samples were expressed and puri®ed as described previously [11]. Each sample was ®ltered (20 lm cut-o) prior to measurement. Solutions were manually injected and illuminated by a 25 mW, 750 nm wavelength, solid state laser. The photons scattered by molecules in the ¯ow cell were collected at 90° angles. Data were ®tted with the analysis software package AutoPro, according to the following method. Autocorrelation analysis of the scattered light gives rise to an exponential decay function, which represents the optical phase shift, caused by molecules moving in Brownian motion. The translational diusion coecient (Dt) is calculated from the optical decay. The hydrodynamic radius (RH) of the molecules is derived from Dt using the StokesEinstein equation. The molecular weight (Mr) can be estimated using an empirically derived relationship between RH and Mr based on globular well-characterized proteins (Dyna Pro-801 manual).

Results and discussion
Overall structure of SEAH187A Ê The SEAH187A structure was determined to 2.1 A with the molecular replacement technique using wild-type SEA as a model (Table 1). There are two independent molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit. Despite the mutation in the Zn2+ site, the Zn2+ site of molecule A is partially occupied. The Zn2+ is sandwiched between symmetry-related A molecules (Fig. 1A) sharing an inÊ teraction surface of 1150 A2 (GRASP calculation [22]). 2+ The Zn ions in this way cross-link SEA molecules through the whole crystal. The B molecules are devoid of zinc. The overall structures of the zinc-loaded and the zinc-depleted molecules, however, are similar. The zincbinding and zinc-depleted C-terminal domains (residues 10±32 and 116±233) exhibit root mean square deviations Ê (r.m.s.d.) of Ca atom positions of 0.5 A. Thus, there are only very small structural eects when the Zn2+ binds to the C-terminal domain. The largest r.m.s.d. of the Ca Ê atom positions (1.3 A) is found by comparing the Nterminal domains (residues 33±115). The structural differences between the N-terminal domains are due to several mobile loops taking part in crystal packing interactions between A and B molecules in the asymmetric Ê unit. The interaction surface is large, 1310 A2 (GRASP calculation [22]) and includes a sulfate ion as well as residues from the approximate TcR binding region [23] of both molecules (Fig. 1B). The structure of SEAH187A Ê is similar (r.m.s.d. of Ca atom positions <1.0 A) to the wild-type SEA structures [9, 10]. In the cadmium-loaded

760

SEA structure the N-terminal helix (amino acids 1±9) is visible, whereas in SEAH187A, as well as in the zincloaded SEA structure, most of these residues cannot be traced in the electron density maps. Lack of stabilization of the N-terminus may lead to truncation of the toxin by proteases. That does not seem to be the case, since mass spectrometry of the protein solution used to obtain SEAH187A crystals revealed an intact 27 kDa protein (data not shown). TcR binding site The interaction surface between A and B molecules in the asymmetric unit contains nine hydrogen bonds, a sulfate ion, and several hydrophobic interactions. Many residues like Y31, Y32, W63, Y64, Y94, Q204 and Y205, which have been shown to be important for TcR recognition Ê [23], are packing in this 1310 A2 large interface (Fig. 1B). The size of the interaction surface is about the same as the interaction surface between SEC3 and TcR in the complex structure [24]. The major conformational dierences between A and B molecules are found at this interaction surface in the disul®de loop (residue 93±105), as well as in the loop containing residues 58±65. The obtained ¯exibility, however, has little to do with the H187A substitution; it rather indicates possibilities for a superantigen like SEA to interact with dierent TcR Vb chains.

Zn2+ sites In SEAH187A the Zn2+ is coordinated by H225, D227, a water molecule and H44 from a symmetry-related molecule (Fig. 2A). The water molecule replaces the missing H187 in molecule A. In the empty Zn2+ site (molecule B), no symmetry-related histidine is available. Thus no Zn2+ is bound. D227 makes a hydrogen bond with N128 Ê Ê in molecule A (3.0 A) and molecule B (2.8 A), respectively. In the Zn2+-depleted molecule B, H225 is stabiÊ lized by a hydrogen bond (3.2 A) to D227 (Fig. 2B). Thus, D227 seems to play an important role in conferring stability to the Zn2+ site in the apo as well as in the Zn2+ state of SEA. The D227A substitution as well as the H225A substitution reduces the binding to MHC class II 1000-fold [11], whereas the SEAH187A studied here shows
Fig. 2 A The Zn2+ site in molecule A (green). The Zn2+ ligands including A187 are shown as ball and stick models. Molecule A provides two ligands, H225 and D227, and the symmetry-related molecule A (blue) provides one ligand, H44. H187 has been replaced by a water molecule, Wat. B The empty Zn2+ site in molecule B (green). The side chains of H225 and D227, shown as Ê ball and stick models, are connected by a hydrogen bond (3.2 A). C At 10 mM, Zn2+ the occupancy of Zn2+ increases in the Zn2+ site of molecule A. A 5r peak is seen in the dierence electron density map, Fobs(high [Zn2+])±Fobs(low [Zn2+]) (drawn as a wire net and contoured at +3r level). D At 10 mM Zn2+, the Zn2+ site of molecule B is also occupied. It is here seen as an 11r peak in the dierence electron density map drawn as in C.

less than a 10-fold reduction in binding to MHC class II [11]. In contrast, the Zn2+ binding is most impaired in the H187A substitution in comparison to the D227A and H225A substitutions [11]. One reasonable explanation to this anomaly could be a distortion of the Zn2+ site where Zn2+ might slide away from its optimal position for recognition by MHC class II if H225 or D227 are substituted. The importance of these amino acids is underlined in the recently determined zinc-loaded SEH structure, where only the corresponding amino acids H206 and D208 function as Zn2+ ligands [25]. The Zn2+ ion was re®ned with an occupancy of 0.6, owing to an otherwise unreasonable high B-factor. The low occupancy of the ion made it important to con®rm the presence of Zn2+. Zn2+ soaking A crystal was soaked with 10 mM ZnCl2 and a data set Ê was collected to 2.9 A resolution (Table 1). The phases from the high-resolution structure were used to calculate a dierence map [Fobs(high Zn2+)±Fobs(low Zn2+)]. The dierence map shows a 5r high peak at the position of Zn2+ in the partially occupied Zn2+ site, indicating an increased occupancy of this ion (Fig. 2C). An 11r peak in the previously empty Zn2+ site shows that Zn2+ can occupy this site as well (Fig. 2D). It is likely that two water molecules complete a tetrahedral coordination of the zinc ion in this site. Re®nement of the occupancy of the Zn2+ ions shows that the previously unsaturated sites now are saturated. Surprisingly, the low-anity Zn2+ site found between domains in wild-type SEA [26] does not seem to be occupied in this case. The cause may be the pH. The SEAH187A crystals where grown at pH 6.0, where histidines may be protonated, and the other crystal form was obtained at pH 6.8 [9]. The concentration of Zn2+ in vivo is only 12±16 lM [1]. Thus, at low Zn2+ concentration it seems necessary for SEAH187A to have an external histidine to be able to bind Zn2+. Is there a self-association of molecules found in solution as well as in the crystal? Dynamic light scattering Dynamic light scattering measurements of 2 mg/mL SEAH187A samples at pH 8.0 indicate polydisperse solutions (Mr55 kDa). Bimodal analyses improved the data and revealed a solution with 50±60% monomers

(Mr30 kDa) and 40±50% oligomers (Mr500 kDa). This result is in agreement with the 50% zinc-linked oligomers and 50% monomers found in the crystal lattice. The same analysis of wild-type SEA reveals an even more polydisperse mixture of oligomers (Mr200±300 kDa). Thus, the wild-type SEA forms approximately ®ve times larger aggregates than SEAH187A. Since crystals have been grown without saturation of the Zn2+ sites and crystal contacts between the A and B molecules (Fig. 1B) help to stabilize the lattice, one could argue that oligomerization does not necessarily depend on Zn2+. The larger aggregation of wild-type SEA having about 10-fold higher anity for Zn2+ than SEAH187A [11] indicates a Zn2+-dependent aggregation. Another experiment shows that addition of 2 mM EDTA to SEAH187A reduces the size of the aggregates (data not shown). Obviously, a high protein concentration is more likely to increase oligomerization. Nevertheless, our data show non-speci®c aggregation as a way to promote stabilization of Zn2+ in a Zn2+ site with missing ligands (bH81 and H187). It is also possible that the stability of the overall structure of SEA is aected by aggregation. It has been shown that Zn2+ is important for the thermal stability of SEA [27]. Possibly not just Zn2+ ligation but also Zn2+-dependent aggregation increases the thermal stability of SEA. This study shows large SEAH187A and wild-type SEA oligomers in solution. Gel ®ltration trials have resulted in SEAH187A and wild-type SEA monomers only (data not shown). Probably the oligomers dissociate into monomers easily. H44 mimics bH81 on MHC class II Since a water molecule replaces H187, H44 on a symmetry-related molecule is a Zn2+ ligand in the position where we think bH81 on MHC class II binds (Table 2). Either H61 (Fig. 3A; Table 2) or a water molecule occupies the same position in the zinc-loaded wild-type SEA structure [10]. In the cadmium loaded wild-type SEA structure [9] the very N-terminal serine (Fig. 3B; Table 2) functions as a ligand to Cd2+. A similar coordination of Zn2+ in wild-type SEA has also been observed (L.A. Svensson, personal communication). To obtain maximal binding of Zn2+, the SEA molecules seem to make use of histidines from other molecules as well as the very N-terminal serine. In vivo, free histidines as well may act as temporary ligands to this exposed

Zn2+ site. A dynamic equilibrium between monomers and oligomers is likely to exist for the SEAH187A substituted protein as well as for wild-type SEA. Since the plausible purpose of the Zn2+ site is to bind bH81 on MHC class II, the self-association between SEA molecules has to be weak. It has been shown that Zn2+ is bound to the complex between SEAH187A and MHC class II [28]. This is in agreement with our experiment, which shows that an extra histidine is enough for SEAH187A to bind Zn2+ at low concentration.
