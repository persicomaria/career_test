One asymmetric unit of the crystal may contain between 28 and 35 molecules, based on reasonable crystal density assumptions. A self-rotation function and Patterson synthesis suggest that RSV capsid protein crystallizes as a helical array. The determinants of the viral particle morphology are not encoded in the capsid alone. The assembly of a helical array in the crystal reflects the absence of any conformational switching. However, it is expected that the subunit interactions seen in the crystal will be 1997 Academic Press preferred and will relate to those found in the immature or mature virion.

INTRODUCTION In retroviruses, the Gag polyprotein assembles into immature particles within the infected cells. During maturation, the viral protease cleaves the Gag polyprotein into the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC) proteins and a number of smaller polypeptides. These events are associated with the formation of an electrondense viral core which consists of assembled CA molecules and contains the genomic RNA, a tRNA primer, the NC, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. In contrast to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), mature Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) virions have a centrally located spherical core (Wills and Craven, 1991). RNA may be required for initialization and organization of the retroviral assembly process. Fragments of the RSV Gag polyprotein can be assembled into cylindrical structures in the presence of RNA and also into spherical particles which closely resemble the immature viral capsid (Campbell and Vogt, 1995, 1997). The p10 domain (which precedes CA in the RSV Gag polyprotein) appears to be a morphological determinant in the assembly of these structures (Campbell and Vogt, 1997). While several studies have shown that the HIV Gag polyprotein, as well as HIV CA alone, assembles into hexagonal arrays (Nermut and Thomas, 1994; Barklis et al., 1997), it appears that retroviruses, unlike many other enveloped viruses, do not adhere to strict icosahedral symmetry (Ful1 To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed.

ler et al., 1997; M. Yeager, personal communication). Understanding the assembly and organization of such viruses requires that the interactions of the Gag domains be defined. The NMR and crystal structures of the amino-terminal domain of the HIV-1 CA protein were recently reported (Gamble et al., 1996; Gitti et al., 1996; Momany et al., 1996). The HIV-1 and RSV CA proteins are homologous (Momany et al., 1996) and seem likely to possess a similar fold. The amino-terminal domain of HIV-1 CA (residues 1 to 151) consists of seven helices arranged roughly as a short five-stranded coiled coil. A variety of data suggest that the dimers which are found in the crystal structures may be present in the assembled HIV core (Gamble et al., 1996; Momany et al., 1996). The HIV-1 CA carboxy-terminal domain (residues 152 to 232) (Gamble et al., 1997) is required for the assembly of the mature viral core (Dorfman et al., 1994). Mature virions of RSV contain an approximately 2:1 mixture of CA and CA/3 (three additional amino acid residues) terminating at residues Ala476 and Met479 of the Gag polyprotein, respectively (Pepinsky et al., 1995) (Fig. 1). Mutants of RSV, in which amino acid residues were deleted from the Gag polyprotein in the region between CA and NC, resulted in Gag particles with normal morphology that were, however, noninfectious (Craven et al., 1993; Pettit et al., 1994; Krishna et al., 1997). Hence, the spacer peptide is critical for proper assembly and directing the conformational rearrangements that occur during viral maturation.

graphic investigation of the RSV CA protein (25.5 kDa), in the anticipation that a structure determination may provide additional information on retroviral assembly and maturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Expression and purification of the RSV CA protein Construction of the plasmids for the expression of RSV CA, CA/3, and CA/12 proteins in Escherichia coli was described earlier (Pepinsky et al., 1995). The E. coli pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA. The suspension was sonicated and then clarified by centrifugation. The protein was precipitated with 34% saturated ammonium sulfate, redissolved in 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The protein that was not soluble after this step was removed by centrifugation. The soluble protein was subjected to batch adsorption on DEAE­cellulose that had been washed with the buffer used in the earlier step. The CA was not adsorbed by DEAE under these conditions, and, hence, the resin containing the impurities was discarded. The solution was then put onto a packed DEAE­cellulose column to remove any residual E. coli proteins. The solution which flowed through the column was saved and precipitated with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitated protein was redissolved in 10 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and dialyzed against the same buffer. A final centrifugation step removed the remaining insoluble material. Crystallization and X-ray diffraction studies Prior to crystallization, the protein was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl and then concentrated to 8.0 mg/ml using a

10-kDa cutoff Centricon filter. The initial crystallization trials were carried out with protease-cleaved CA which was predominantly CA/12. Later crystallizations were performed with genetically engineered CA, CA/3, and CA/12 proteins. Needle-shaped crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 5 ml of protein solution with 5 ml of reservoir solution that contained 7% methyl-pentane-diol (MPD), 220 mM citric acid at pH 4.0, 10 mM ammonium sulfate, and 1.5% PEG 8000. The drops were equilibrated at 15 C against 1 ml of reservoir solution. All of the above constructs gave rise to similar crystals. Crystals that were grown at room temperature became discolored and their morphology degenerated within a week. Severe radiation damage occurs when crystals of RSV CA are exposed to X rays at room temperature. Therefore, the crystals were flash-frozen on a loop in a nitrogen stream at 110K after being soaked for 5 min in 25% glycerol, 2 mg/ml CA protein, 7% MPD, 220 mM citric acid at pH 4.0, 10 mM ammonium sulfate, and 1.5% PEG 8000. The crystals dissolved when the protein was omitted from the cryostabilization solution. X-ray diffraction data from frozen native crystals of RSV CA were collected using CuKa radiation from a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray source, operated at 50 kV and 100 mA, equipped with perpendicular focusing mirrors and a Ni filter. Oscillation images were recorded with an R-axis II-C image plate detector. Data from heavy atom soaked crystals were ° collected at the A1 beamline (l Å 0.920 A) of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) using a CCD

Line groups based on the point group 72 give rise to two sets of twofold axes. These alternate along the cylinder axis and are shown with solid and dashed lines. The figure shows a helix with line group symmetry 712. The two antiparallel helices, related by a crystallographic 21 axis, are at a height of 1 0 (shown) and 2 (not shown). This model should be regarded as tentative, as it does not fully account for some features seen in the self-rotation function.

detector with a crystal-to-detector distance of 162 mm and an angular oscillation range of 0.75 . Diffraction data were integrated and scaled with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). The best data were collected from crystals soaked for 2 days with 0.1 mM KAuCl4 (Table 1). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ° The crystals of RSV CA diffract X rays to 3.5 A resolu° in the b* tion in the a* direction, but only to about 5 A and c* directions. Thus, the fall-off in intensity of the Bragg diffraction from these crystals is anisotropic. The frozen crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2 ° ° with unit cell parameters a Å 374.4 A, b Å 128.1 A, c Å ° , and b Å 121.8 and had an average effective 200.2 A mosaic spread of 0.55 . A self-rotation function calculated using data between ° 10 and 5 A resolution shows a large peak ``A,'' at f Å 015 and c Å 90 for all k values (polar angles and orthogonalization convention defined as in Rossmann and Blow (1962)) (Fig. 2). In addition, there is an extended arc containing peaks ``B'' that describes a great circle and represents a plane perpendicular to the direction given by peak ``A'' (Fig. 2A). These features are consistent with a cylindrical or helical arrangement of molecules where the helix axis corresponds to the direction of peak ``A,'' the [2,0,1] direction of the unit cell (Fig. 3). Thus, as expected, the direction of best diffraction corresponds roughly to the helical axis. The Patterson synthesis is

also consistent with a helical arrangement of molecules and exhibits strong features in a line corresponding to the direction of the helix axis. Packing considerations show that the mean diameter of the helix is between 80 ° ° and 95 A, with a pitch of 665 A (Fig. 3). The helix must contain two parallel and nonequivalent twofold axes (coincident with crystallographic diads) perpendicular to the axis of the helix. The symmetry groups which characterize helices are line or rod groups (see Alexander, 1929; Vainshtein, 1994). They describe three-dimensional objects which are periodic in only one direction. Line groups may be considered as arising from the combination of a onedimensional translation group with a three-dimensional point group. The one-dimensional plot of the rotation function (for a rotation about the helix axis) shows a strong maximum at k Å 103 (Fig. 2B) and the peaks ``B'' show weak maxima every 25.7 (Fig. 2A). These latter peaks, ``B,'' are not well resolved from each other on the extended arc on which they lie. The spacing of the peaks ``B'' suggest that the RSV CA protein might form a helix based on a dihedral point group such as 72, as is seen in crystals of the eye lens protein d-crystallin (Simpson et al., 1995). This means that the helix would be built around a sevenfold screw rotation axis and would possess additional twofold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis. However, this helical symmetry should give rise to equally spaced maxima at k Å 51.4 , 102.9 , and 154.3 for rotations about the helix axis (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a strong peak is actually observed at k Å 103 .

It is possible to construct other models for the helical symmetry, in which many twofold rotational axes would apply only locally and would not be elements of the line group of the helix. This would explain the lack of resolution of the peaks ``B'' in the k Å 180 rotation function section (Fig. 2A). Assuming that the helix contains a sevenfold screw rotation axis (or some higher multiple of this), the number of subunits in the crystallographic asymmetric unit will be 7n (where n Å 1, 2, 3, rrr). With 28 (n Å 4) or 35 (n Å 5) subunits in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, the Matthews coefficients, VM (Matthews, 1968), ° are 3.8 or 2.8 A3/Da, respectively, consistent with known crystal packing densities. The high noncrystallographic ° redundancy and limitation of resolution to 3.5 A of these crystals are comparable to those found in many virus structures. Structure solution of such crystals invariably leads to readily interpretable, high-quality electron density maps. Difference Patterson maps calculated from isomorphous heavy atom derivatives should show the organization of the RSV CA protein in the crystal. Techniques are currently being developed to analyze difference Pattersons using line group symmetry, similar to the analysis of Pattersons when the heavy atoms are related by a closed point group (Argos and Rossmann, 1976; Arnold et al., 1987). We are also investigating the interpretation of the self translation function (Rossmann et al., 1964; Litvin, 1977) in the presence of line group symmetry. In vitro assembly of viral capsid proteins often results in polymorphic structures, as seen for instance in polyomaviruses (Baker et al., 1983; Salunke et al., 1989; Stehle et al., 1996). The interaction of protein subunits is usually found to be the same or similar in these structures. Viral self-assembly requires that the same noncovalent contacts between subunits are used repeatedly, accompanied in more complex systems by switching mechanisms which alter the nature of the subunit interfaces (Dokland et al., 1997). The packing arrangement found in the crystals of RSV CA is, therefore, likely to be related to the organization found in onco- and lentiviruses, and the twofold symmetries seen in the RSV CA helix may be related to the dimeric structures of HIV-1 CA (Gamble et al., 1996; Momany et al., 1996).
