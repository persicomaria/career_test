Large orthorhombic crystals of the complex formed by bovine trypsinogen and a semisynthetic homologous bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with the reactive-site lysine residue replaced by an arginine residue ([Argl'IPTI) have been obtained which are isomorphous with the crystals of PTI-trypsinogen [Bode, W., Schwager, P. and Huber, R. (1978) J . Mol. Biol. 118,99- 1121. The X-ray crystal structure of the ternary complex of trypsinogen[ArgI5]PTIwith the dipeptide Val-Val has been determined by X-ray data to 2.2-A (0.22-nm) resolution by means of difference Fourier methods and has been crystallographically refined to a final R-value of 0.17. Replacement of the reactive-site Lys" by an arginine residue is accompanied in the complex by small movements of polar side groups of trypsin and enclosed solvent molecules within the specificity pocket. Only solvent molecule 414 OH which mediates the hydrogen bond interactions between Lys" NZ and Asp189carboxylate is expelled, thus allowing the bulkier guanidyl group to approach this carboxylate. The dipeptide Val-Val binds in the pocket accepting the Ile-Val N-terminus in trypsin. The cavity left by the CD-methyl group of upon replacement by a valine residue is only partially filled by slight rearrangements of neighbouring peptide side chains. Part of the positive free energy change observed upon replacement of Ile-Val may allow for the maintenance of this cavity. Trypsin possesses a quite narrow cleavage specificity catalyzing almost exclusively the hydrolysis of peptide (and ester) bonds carboxy-terminal of arginine and lysine residues (`primary specificity'). In contrast to most other serine proteinases, trypsin exhibits a rather low `secondary specificity',i. e. its rate of hydrolysis depends only moderately on the type , number and position of amino acid residues adjacent to the basic PI residue in susceptible substrates [2,3]. This dominating effect of the P1 residue means that the binding of the basic P1 side chain alone (in combination with the specific interactions made with the PI amide nitrogen and the peptide group to be cleaved, see below) is sufficient to orient this scissile peptide bond rigidly and precisely in relation to the catalytic residues, in order to allow a minimum energy pathway for the addition reaction and to pay for the entropy losses which are probably associated with transition-state formation in biomolecular reactions [4]. According to cleavage experiments with model peptides containing lysine and arginine [5] and protein fragments [6,7], trypsin shows a slight preference for arginine compared to lysine. Due to the differing length, bulkiness and

charge distribution of both side chains, this low discrimination power is not self-evident. Previously we have been able to show for the crystal structure of the complexes formed by PTI (Trasylolg) with bovine trypsin [8], anhydrotrypsin [9] and trypsinogen [ 101 and for the complex formed by the pancreatic secretory inhibitor with trypsinogen [l I] how the specificity pocket of trypsin is shaped to fit to lysine side chains of bound inhibitors and substrates by use of enclosed solvent molecules. Blow and coworkers [I21 have published a preliminary model of the porcine trypsin complex formed with STI (with a reactive-site Arg63 residue), but have not yet refined this model, so that a reliable, detailed description of the arginine side-chain interaction is still lacking. Our refined models of bovine trypsin inhibited by benzamidine [13] and by p-amidinophenylpyruvic acid [14,15] seemed to be analogous, but not equivalent, models. The exact knowledge of the detailed interaction of the authentic arginine side chain seems to be of special interest, because most of the trypsin-like, but more specific, serine proteinases have a clear preference for arginine as PI residue, e. g. pancreatic kallikrein [16], thrombin and factors Xa and IXa. For the latter three proteinases, model building was tried [17,18]. Sealock and Laskowski [I91 and Jering and Tschesche [20] have previously shown how the reactive-site arginine and lysine residues of the native inhibitors STI and PTI can be replaced by other amino acids, using enzymatic and peptide-chemical methods, respectively. It became evident, however, that during the semisynthesis of [Argl'IPTI the polypeptide chain was unintentionally cleaved between Arg39 and Ala4' with successive removal of Arg39

186 [21]. Native single-chain [ArgI5]PTI could be rendered the main product when porcine kallikrein was substituted for bovine or porcine trypsin to trap the mutated inhibitor (Wenzel & Tschesche, unpublished). We have further been able to show crystallographically for bovine trypsinogen [22] and boovine trypsin [13] that four peptide segments representing 15 A of the whole molecule are disordered in the zymogen but form upon activation cleavage [23,24] the rigid activation domain including the specificity pocket and the IleI6 cleft. The latter accommodates the newly liberated N-terminal Ile16-Val", the @-ammoniumgroup of which forms an internal salt bridge with the carboxylate group of Asp'94. Additionally we demonstrated that such a transition of the zymogen to a trypsin-like conformation can also be unduced without activation cleavage, namely upon association of high-affinity inhibitors such as PTI [lo] and/or by binding of dipeptides sequentially related to the N-terminus of trypsin, i.e. Ile-Val, into the Ile'6-cleft [25,26]. The crystal structure analysis of the trypsinogen-PTI complex shows that the empty Ile" pocket in the trypsinogen complex accomodates exogenous Ile-Val dipeptide in a manner identical to the binding of the endogenous Ile'6-Val'7 N-terminus in trypsin. Binding studies with a series of systematically varied peptides have shown that this interaction is highly specific. Even the closely related but slightly smaller Val-Val peptide is 30-fold less efficient, corresponding to a less favourable free energy of binding of 8 kJ/mol [26]. The difference in affinity might be due to a hole left behind by the missing CD-methyl group. Alternatively the protein structure could also relax to some extent to fill the hole. The crystal structure analysis and the molecular model of the ternary tryp~inogen-[Arg'~-]PTI-Val-Val complex provides answers to both questions concerning the Arg15 and the Val-Val binding interactions respectively. grown by the vapour diffusion method at 20°C from 1.5 - 1.7 M magnesium sulfate solutions (pH 6.9) containing 10 mg/ml trysinogen and 2 mg/nil [Arg15]PTI. Three crystals have been transferred to and soaked for five days in 2.4 M magnesium sulfate pH 6.9 which contained 20 mM Val-Val peptide. With cell constants of a=75.51 A, b=85.45 8, and c = 122.30A these trypsinogen-[Arg''IPTI-Val-Val crystals are almost isomorphous with those formed by trypsinogen-PT1 ( a = 75.7 8,; b = 84.9 A, c = 122.6 A) and trypsinogen-PTI-IleVal (u = 75.7A; b = 84.4& c = 122.6A [lo]) respectively. Only the b axis shows considerable deviations up to 1%. Data collection and evaluation Intensity data were collected from five crystals on a modified Siemens diffractometer with an w-20 scan technique using Ni-filtered CuK, radiation. In total 18470 reflexions were measured to 2.24 8, resolution and corrected for absorption [28]. These reflexions were merged and scaled to yield 12422 unique reflezions above a 10 significance level corresponding to 63.8 A of all possible measurements to 2.24-8, resolution. The outermost resolution shell (2.24 -2.28 A) contained 245 significant observations ( = 2 4 . 2 ~ ) .The R factor (defined as Clihj - (i)h//cltjfor symmetry equivalent reflexions) was 0.069 (with Ihj being the intensity of t h e j t h individual measurement and ( / ) h the average intensity value of the reflexion h, and with the summation running over all reflexions). Data reduction and most subsequent calculations have been performed using the PROTEIN program system [29]. Model building and rejinemenl A difference Fourier map calculated between the complex tryp~inogen-[Arg'~]PTI-Val-Val the original complex and trypsinogen-PTI-Ile-Val using the phases of the latter in the resolution range 3.0 -7.0 A showed an elongated, positive density peak (5.60) around the distal NZ atom of Lys" of the PTI moiety. It clearly indicated the replacement of a lysine by an arginine residue. Negative density peaks appeared at Ile16 CD of the dipeptide Ile-Val, indicating the presence of a valine instead of an isoleucine, and at solvent molecule 414 OH. The starting coordinate set for the structure refinement was the structure tryp~inogen-[Arg~~]PTI-Ile-Val leaving NE, CZ, NEHl and NEH2 in a `dummy' status first. The dipeptide Ile-Val was changed to Val-Val by deleting the CD atom. Solvent molecule 414OH was removed from the coordinate set. The R value of this starting model, defined as c(lF&,l - / F ~ ~ ~ c l ) / ~ l F o , , ~ l was 0.392 for all data in the resolution range 3.0 -8.0 8,. This high R value may be caused by nonisomorphism. Crystallographic refinement was performed using the diagonal least-squares refinement with energy restraints EREF [30]. Model building and inspection of models and of Fob,-Fc,~c difference Fourier maps as well as 2FOb,-Fc,,, electron density maps were done on a Vector General 3400 graphics display system using the program FRODO [31]. Averaged B factors were calculated for main-chain atoms including CB and side-chain atoms without CB respectively. When the R value reduced to 0.197 (2.24 -7.0-8, resolution) the side chain of Arg" was corrected and its `dummy' atoms activated. To prevent repulsion of the reactive-site Ser195OG by the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond 15 - 16 van der Waals' interactions were excluded between both atoms. For all other interactions the energy parameters recommended by Levitt [32] were used. After several further refinement

MATERIALS AND METHODS Crq'stullizution Bovine trypsinogen and all chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt). Val-Val was from Serva (Heidelberg). PTI, prepared and sold by Bayer (Leverkusen) under the trademark Trasylol 3 , was a kind gift of the Bayer AG (Wuppertal).The procedure for the preparation of [Arg'5]PTI will be described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, it consists of the following steps. a) Enzymatic hydrolysis of the PTI reactivesite peptide bond L y ~ " - A l a 'to yield the modified inhibitor ~ PTI [27]. b) Removal of Lys" by carboxypeptidase B [20]. c) Coupling of arginine to Cys14 of PTI* in a reverse reaction of carboxypeptidase B giving the modified inhibitor [Arg"]PTI* in minute amounts [20]. d) Trapping of [Arg15]PTI* by complex formation with porcine kallikrein thus shifting the carboxypeptidase-catalysed reaction towards synthesis (according to [20]). e) Kinetic-controlled complex dissociation to yield single chain [Arg"]PTI as the main product (according to [20]). The semisynthetic inhibitor was purified by gel filtration and cation-exchange chromatography. It was shown to be homogeneous by amino acid analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high-pressure liquid cation-exchange chromatography.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Arg'" and the specificity pocket

The model of tryp~inogen-[Arg'~]PTI-Val-Val found was to be very similar to that of trysinogen-PTI-Ile-Val, even in both pockets where amino acid replacements occurred (see below). Optimal superposition yields translational shifts of the former model of -0.2 8, in the x, -0.9 A in they and 0.4 8, in the z direction. All main-chain atoms (including CB) superimpose to 0.22 8, r.m.s. This value is within the range obtained by comparison of all related PTI complexes and close to the expected error in the coordinates. Deviations above 0.2 A may be considered significant. Most of the conformational differences within the intermolecular interface are smaller. Ser195 OG approaches the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond to about 3.0 A, a distance larger than has been observed for the other PTI complexes [15]. The PTI component can be unequivocally traced from Asp3' to Ala581. The p-turn opposite to the contact region shows the largest deviations to trypsinogen-PTI-Ile-Val (1.0A at 261 0).The absence of any significant, non-interpretable electron density in the final map provides independent evidence for the homogeneity of the [Arg' "]PTI sample contained in the crystalline material. After optimal superposition of the complexed and free trypsin, the r.m.s. deviation of all main-chain atoms (including CB) is 0.38 A. The main-chain atoms of segment Asp'89 to Ser195 (partially shown in Fig. 4) exhibit even larger deviations resulting in a slight concerted shift of the whole chain segment in the direction of the active-site residues in the PTI complex. These deviations may reflect different crystal contacts and in part real structural changes induced by inhibitor binding. Fig. 1 shows the Sim-weighted 2F0bs-Fca1c Fourier map together with the refined model around Arg15'. Its side chain is clearly defined by density all along its length.

ordered solvent molecules provided by the specificity pocket, together with their distances. In Fig. 3 equivalent parts of the trypsin(ogen) binding pocket are shown with the Arg15' and Lys'" residue of PTI bound, as observed in trypsinogen[Arg' "IPTI-Val-Val and trypsinogen-PTI-Ile-Val, respectively. Starting with its C D atom, the deviation of the ArgI5' side chain becomes significant, in order to enable the proper accomodation of the bulkier planar guanidyl group. As in benzamidine-trypsin [13] the internal solvent 414 OH which mediates hydrogen bonding and charge compensation between Lys'" NZ and Asp'89 is expelled. In contrast to the analogous, but symmetrical interaction with the amidine group ofp-amidinophenyl-pyruvic acid [14], and similar to the benzamidine interaction (Fig. 4) the carboxylate of AsplS9and the guanidyl fork of Arg'" interact in a less symmetrical manner, giving rise to different distances between both nitrogen-oxygen pairs (see Fig. 2). Besides its hydrogen bond interaction with Asp'89 OD2, Arg15' NEHI forms a second, favourable hydrogen bond with solvent molecule 416 OH,

enclosed in the back of the pocket, which undergoes a slight movement towards the guanidyl plane. Simultaneously, the side chain of another possible bond acceptor, Ser"', rotates further out of this plane (corresponding to CB and OG shifts of about 0.6A) to clear the way for the guanidyl group. Likewise, the carbonyl group of Ser"', placed below the guanidyl plane and thus being stereochemically incapable of hydrogen bonding, is pushed downwards by about 0.6 A compared with the PTI complexes, where it is attracted to enable hydrogen bond formation with Lys"' NZ [33]. The second distal nitrogen of Arg15',NEH2, likewise finds two partner atoms (AspIS9 OD1 and Gly2190), which are stereochemically optimally placed to accept hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2). As can be seen in Fig, 3, the replacement of the lysine side chain in the pocket by an arginine is accompanied by a shift of G I Y " ~ mostly of its carbonyl oxygen by 0.6 A, to , enable more favourable interactions with Arg15' NEH2 and with solvent molecule 403 OH. Gly2160 and Ser"' 0 are both in van der Waals' distance of one guanidyl nitrogen, but are in a stereochemically too unfavourable position to form hydrogen bonds as had been suggested earlier by Sweet et al. [12].

The hydrogen atom of the third, more proximal nitrogen atom, NE, points directly to solvent molecule 403 OH, which is thus tetrahedrally surrounded by two hydrogen bond acceptors (GlyZi90 and Pro13'0 ) and two possible hydrogen bond donors NE2 and Arg"' NE), which are placed in hydrogen bond distance (2.8 -3.1 A, see Fig. 2). Two further oxygen-containing groups, of 503 OH and of Gly2160, are only in van der Waals' contact. These latter interactions and the remaining inhibitory-trypsin contacts around the scissile bond are very similar to those described for the PTI complexes. In the presence of a lysine side chain (as in trypsinogen-PTI-IleVal) solvent molecule 403 is slightly shifted (in order to stay in van der Waals'distance of the unpolar Lys'" CE atom, see Fig. 2), and can only form the remaining three hydrogen bonds. Semisynthetic homologous [ArgI5]PTI [20] and [ L ~ S ~ ~ ] S 91Japparently inhibit bovine trypsin equally as [I T well as the native inhibitors. Although the extraordinary homogeneity required for such association measurements and the extreme affinities may have impaired those results, the apparently poorer packing around 403 OH seems not to be

reflected by the energetics of complex formation. Evidently, the contact site of trypsin, especially of its binding pocket, is adequately shaped to accomodate equally well the side chains of lysine and of arginine P1 residues, by providing charged or polar groups which allow a close and fixed packing of both PI residues and of the P3 to P2 main chain independent of the character of their side chains and by slight rearrangements, as discussed above. This contrasts with other trypsin-like, but more specific serine proteinases, as for example pancreatic kallikrein [34], which prefer basic PI residues, but require in addition specific preceding residues (e.g. bulky hydrophobic groups at the P2 position) in a substrate to be efficiently cleaved. This differing behaviour can be explained by a worse fitting in the S1 pocket, which provides less favourable anchoring points for the terminal basic group of the P1 residue, by a hydrophobic nature of residue 192 (which is, for example, methionine in kallikrein), which cannot take part in the very extensive hydrogen bonding network formed via 403 OH and the P2 carbonyl etc. In fact the ordered solvent molecules observed in the trypsin-PTI interface have no counterpart in the kallikrein-PTI complex [16].

Ile"j cleft Fig. 5 shows the electron density and the refined model around the Val-Val dipeptide inserted into the Ile16-binding cleft of the trypsinogen moiety. The dipeptide is clearly defined by adequate density. In Fig. 6 this model has been superimposed by the corresponding residues of the trypsinogenPTI-Ile-Val model. All polar interactions made between ValVal and surrounding trypsinogen groups (Val16-N-Asp'94OD1 : 2.7 A; Val16-N -430-OH: 2.7 A; Va1'6-N-Asn'43-0: 3.3 A; Va1'6-0-429-OH: 3.2 A; Val''-N-Asp'89-O: 2.9 A; Va1"-0 -AsplS9-N: 2.9 A) are completely conserved. Most evident (Fig. 5) is the deviation (0.9 A) of the CB atoms of Val16vvand Ile161v, respectively, brought about by a slight rotation around $. Both CG atoms however, occupy identical positions due to the opposite orientation of the side-chain fork due to a x rotation of 180". The hydrophobiccavitycreated by ' the removal of the Ile161vCD atom, is only partially filled upon a small concerted invasive movement of the internal side chains of IleI3' (with shifts of CG2 and CD1 of 0.6 A and 0.7 A) and of Ser'". This latter residue lines the pocket and

190
seems to respond to the simultaneous repulsions, brought about by the ArgI5' side chain (see above). In the trypsinogen-PTI structure [lo] the Ile16 cleft is already formed in the absence of any embedded dipeptide or N-terminus through the stabilizing association with PTI. The additivity of the binding contributions of both residues of the dipeptide [26] underlines the self-sufficient character of this cleft, which is apparently a prerequisite for a high discrimination capability. The IleI6 cleft is obviously designed for the optimal fit of an Ile16 residue. Upon binding of Val-Val, not only is a smaller hydrophobic contact area formed, but simultaneously less dense packing is achieved. The former effect can be estimated from hydrophobicity values derived from the free energy of transfer of amino acids from water to a nonpolar liquid (as listed, e.g. by Chothia [35]) to less than 4 kJ/mol. The more positive free energy of binding of 8 kJ/mol observed for exogenous Val-Val compared with Ile-Val binding might therefore include other unfavourable contributions, as for example formation of an inadequately filled cavity or of a less densely packed internal region. Close packing of the constituent amino acid residues is, however, normally observed in protein interiors [36,37] and presumably is necessary for stable folding. It may be added that even larger free energy changes have been reported in the literature for proteinpeptide interactions upon subtraction of a single methylene group. So, the association constants of the complexes formed by chymotrypsin and two third-domain ovomucoid inhibitors, having leucine and valine as P1 residues respectively, differ by more than 1000, corresponding to free energy differences of more than 16 kJ/mol [38].
