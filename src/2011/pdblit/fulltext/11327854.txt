ABSTRACT: The X-ray crystal structure of the substrate free form of Staphylococcus aureus UDP-Nacetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB) has been solved to 2.3 Å resolution with an R-factor of 20.3% and a free R-factor of 22.3%. While the overall fold of the S. aureus enzyme is similar to that of the homologous Escherichia coli MurB X-ray crystal structure, notable distinctions between the S. aureus and E. coli MurB protein structures occur in residues involved in substrate binding. Analysis of available MurB sequences from other bacteria suggest that the S. aureus MurB structure is representative of a distinct structural class of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductases including Bacillus subtilis and Helicobacter pylori that are characterized by a modified mechanism for substrate binding.

Reports of an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria have stimulated efforts to find new classes of therapeutic agents that will prevent society from entering a "post-antibiotic age" (1). Historically, three important cellular functions have been the major targets of antibiotics: cell wall biosynthesis, DNA replication, and protein translation. The biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall, in particular the peptidoglycan polymer, is a particularly attractive target since this flexible structure provides protection for the cell against osmotic lysis (2). To date, most of the therapeutic agents discovered that target cell wall biosynthesis inhibit the later stages of peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the point where interstrand cross linking occurs between the peptide chains. Recent efforts have been directed toward purifying and characterizing all the enzymes in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway with the hope that novel enzyme inhibitors might be found for these essential targets. Bacterial peptidoglycan is a polymer that includes a repeating disaccharide subunit of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid and an extended four to five residue amino acid chain. The first step toward creating this peptidoglycan polymer involves the formation of UDP-Nacetylmuramic acid from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine by the enzymes MurA and UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB).1 MurA catalyzes the first stage of this transformation by transferring the enolpyruvate moiety of phosphoenolpyruvate to the 3 hydroxyl of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine with the release of inorganic phosphate (3-4). The resulting product, enolpyruvyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine

(EP-UDPGlcNAc), undergoes a reduction catalyzed by the MurB enzyme (5) by utilizing one equivalent of NADPH and a solvent-derived proton (6). This two-electron reduction creates the lactyl ether of UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid upon which a five-residue peptide chain is built. Construction of this pentapeptide is catalyzed in a nonribosomal fashion by the enzymes MurC (7-8), MurD (9), MurE (10-11), and MurF (12) (Figure 1) in both Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. The resulting UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is subsequently attached to an undecaprenyl lipid moiety by MraY (13) and joined to another sugar, UDPN-acetylglucosamine, by MurG (14-15). In Staphylococci, the next steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis involve another family of enzymes, FemX, FemA, and FemB, which create a pentaglycine strand in a stepwise fashion on the amino terminus of the lysine side chain (16-18). This extended Lys-Gly5 chain serves as the interstrand bridge between nearby peptide strands. Cross-linking between strands can then occur between the lysine-pentapeptide bridge and the carbonyl of the fourth residue (D-Ala) with release of the terminal D-Ala in a transpeptidation step catalyzed by penicillin binding proteins (19-21). While several laboratories have characterized many of the Mur enzymes for E. coli including the structures of MurA (22), MurB (23), MurD (24), MurF (25), and MurG (26), little biochemistry or structural biology has been carried out on these enzymes from a clinically relevant Gram-positive

S. aureus MurB X-ray Structure

Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 8, 2001 2341 organism and compares it to the previously reported E. coli MurB structure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Expression of MurB and Incorporation of Selenomethionine. S. aureus MurB (Genbank accession numberAF300988) was expressed using UC 15169, E. coli construct K12S (F lacIq) (pQE-10 murB). MurB cloned into pQE-10 (Qiagen) was obtained from Human Genome Sciences. For expression, the plasmid was transformed into the E. coli K12S F cell line which has an ampicillin resistance marker. Stock supplies of the culture were maintained at -80 °C in Luria Broth containing ampicillin at 100 µg/mL with 10% glycerol added as a cryopreservative agent. Seed fermentations were prepared in 100 mL volumes of M9 medium contained in 500-mL wide mouth fermentation flasks. The formulation of basal M9 utilized for these studies was Na2HPO4, 6 g; KH2PO4, 3 g; NH4Cl, 1.0 g; and NaCl, 0.5 g per liter of deionized water. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with concentrated KOH. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving for 30 min. Prior to inoculation, the following filter-sterilized solutions were added per liter of basal medium: 1 M MgSO4, 1.0 mL; 1 M CaCl2, 0.3 mL; trace metal salts solution, 0.3 mL; and 20% glucose, 20 mL. The trace metal salts solution contained per liter of deionized water: MgCl2,6H2O, 39.44 g; MnSO4,H2O, 5.58 g; FeSO4, 7H2O, 1.11 g; Na2MoO4,2H2O, 0.48 g; CaCl2, 0.33 g; NaCl, 0.12 g; and ascorbic acid, 1.0 g. Filter-sterilized ampicillin was added to the medium at a final concentration of 100 µg/mL. A 0.1 mL aliquot of the stock culture was inoculated into the medium and allowed to grow at 37 °C for 18-20 h with a shaking rate of 200 rpm. The mature seed culture was harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in an equal volume of M9 medium. The resuspended seed was used to inoculate expression fermentations at a ratio of seed culture volume to culture medium volume of 0.03:1. For expression of selenomethionine MurB, M9 media was again utilized in 100 mL volumes containing 100 µg/mL of ampicillin. Multiple flasks were employed to achieve the desired production volume. Since UC 15169 is not a methionine auxotroph, incorporation of selenomethionine was accomplished through down-regulation of methionine biosynthesis just prior to induction of MurB expression with IPTG, isopropyl thio- -D-galactosidase (23, 28). The culture was grown at 37 °C with a shaking rate of 200 rpm until an A600 of 0.6. At this point, the following filter-sterilized amino acids were added. L-Lysine, L-threonine, and Lphenylalanine were added to final concentrations of 100 µg/ mL. L-Leucine, L-isoleucine, and L-valine were added to final concentrations of 50 µg/mL. Filter-sterilized L-selenomethionine was added simultaneously to a final concentration of 50 µg/mL. After 15-20 min, protein expression was induced by the addition of filter-sterilized IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. Growth of the culture was continued at 200 rpm for an additional 4 h until an A600 of 2.0. This coincided with maximum growth and maximum expression of MurB. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation and frozen at -80 °C. Under these conditions, the average yield of cell paste was 4-4.5 g/L. Selenomethionyl MurB comprised roughly 2-5% of the total cell protein with >75% expressed in the soluble form.

organism. Interest in the molecular mechanisms of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in Gram-positive organisms has increased in recent years as methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains have surfaced that have acquired resistance to the antibiotic vancomycin (27). We have chosen to focus our drug discovery efforts on S. aureus in an attempt to identify new Gram-positive specific antibacterial agents. Recent access to the entire genome of S. aureus has facilitated this process by providing the necessary sequences for the relevant genes of interest. This report describes the first X-ray crystal structure of MurB from a clinically relevant Gram-positive

2342 Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 8, 2001 Purification of Selenomethionine MurB. All operations were performed at 4 °C and 2-mercaptoethanol and DTT were added to buffers immediately before use. Three hundred milliliters of equilibration buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 25 mM imidazole, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.2 mg/mL DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim #104159) was added to 26 g of cell paste obtained from 6 L of fermentation broth and was resuspended by using a Tekmar Tissumizer set on a power setting of 60. The suspension was homogenized by passing it twice through a Rannie homogenizer at 10 000 PSI. The homogenate was centrifuged at 39200g for 60 min in a JA20 rotor in a Beckman J2-21 centrifuge. The supernatant was filtered by using a Nalgene 0.2 µm CN filter unit and applied to a Qiagen NTA Superflow column charged with nickel (column volume of 7.9 mL). The column was then washed with 4 column volumes of equilibration buffer and 22 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mM imidazole, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) at a flow rate of 108 mL/h and eluted with 2.5 column volumes of elution buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 300 mM imidazole, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) at a flow rate of 60 mL/h. DTT was added to the eluted material to a final concentration of 10 mM and the treated material was dialyzed for 22 h against two changes of nitrogen sparged dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM DTT). After dialysis, the sample was sterile filtered, fractionated, and stored at -80 °C. The protein concentration was 2.42 mg/mL as determined by amino acid analysis. The prepared MurB protein had the correct N-terminal sequence for the first 20 residues. The mass as measured by electrospray mass spectrometry indicated the full incorporation of the five selenomethionines into the protein. Amino acid analysis gave a correlation coefficient of 0.99 between the recovered and theoretical amino acid composition, indicative not only of high purity but also of the correct amino acid composition in the protein. Protein Crystallization. Protein samples were buffer exchanged into 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and concentrated to 20 mg/mL using an Ultrafree 0.5 centrigual filters with a Biomax 10K membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Selenomethionine MurB crystals were grown in 3µL + 3µL sitting drops in 9.75% PEG 8000, 0.1 M cacodylic acid, pH 6.5, 0.55 M ammonium sulfate, 20% DMSO, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol with 1 mM EP-UDPGlcNAc substrate. These conditions were originally identified by screening for crystallization conditions with the methionine incorporated S. aureus MurB. The hexagonal shaped crystals grew over a period of two to three weeks. The mother liquor served as the cryoprotectant for freezing during data collection at 100 K in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Structure Determination. Access to synchrotron radiation at the Advance Photon Source at Argonne National Labs (IMCA-CAT, Beamline 17-ID) afforded the opportunity to solve the S. aureus MurB structure by multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing. EXAFS analysis revealed a sharp selenium K edge for the selenomethionine MurB (data not shown). A three wavelength experiment was carried out with a low energy wavelength (12 000 eV, 1.0332 Å), a wavelength corresponding to the inflection point of the absorption edge

(12 659.4 eV, 0.97939 Å), and a wavelength collected at the peak of the absorption edge (12 660.8 eV, 0.97928 Å). All diffraction data were collected on a 2k by 2k Bruker CCD ¨ detector. Data sets at each wavelength were processed separately with the program SAINT (Siemens Analytical X-ray Systems, Madison, WI) while keeping the anomalous pairs separate (Table 1). The inflection point and peak data sets were scaled to the remote energy data set using SCALEIT in CCP4 (29) by treating the remote wavelength as native. Anomalous and dispersive difference Patterson maps showed strong signals for four of the five selenium atoms suggesting the N-terminal methionine was disordered. Locations of the selenium sites were determined using the automated Patterson solution routine in SHELX (30). The location of each selenium site was confirmed by the ability of individual sites to generate phases that could identify the other sites in cross difference Fourier calculations. All heavy atom parameter refinement and phasing calculations were carried out with MLPHARE (29, 31) by treating the remote wavelength as native and the edge and peak wavelengths as derivatives (32). The phases were subsequently subjected to solvent flattening using the program DM (29, 33, 34). Model building was performed using the program CHAIN (35). The E. coli MurB model was used as a template for model building to speed the placement of the main chain atoms. All refinement steps were carried out using XPLOR 3.8.5.1 and XPLOR 98.0 (36) against the 1.0332 Å (low energy) data set. Several rounds of torsional dynamics (37) and simulated annealing (38) with rebuilding after each round of refinement were carried out. In the later stages of refinement, a bulk solvent model was included to properly account for inclusion of lower resolution data (39). Progress of the refinement was monitored by the free R factor that was calculated for 10% of the reflections that were not included in refinement (40). Analysis by PROCHECK showed good main chain geometry and side chain torsion angles (41). Figure 4 was made with Molscript 2.1 (42) and Raster3D (43), and Figures 6 and 10 were made with Molscript 2.1 only. RESULTS Structure Solution.

Structural features that are present in the E. coli but not the S. aureus protein are shown in red and were omitted from superpositions. In regions where there are significant deletions in the S. aureus protein as compared to the E. coli protein, no significance should be given to the placement of the connecting residues in the S. aureus sequence.

Initial attempts with molecular replacement using the E. coli MurB coordinates (23) were unsuccessful despite the near 50% similarity with the S. aureus sequence (Figure 2). Therefore, an independent set of phases was derived using multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) with selenomethionine incorporated protein (44). S. aureus selenomethionine MurB was prepared by inhibiting endogenous methionine biosynthesis while supplementing the expressing cells with selenomethionine (23, 28). Methionine biosynthesis downregulation eliminates the need for transferring the protein expression vector into a met- strain. This technique reduces the time and effort required for producing selenomethionine incorporated protein and results in near quantitative incorporation of selenomethionine into the overexpressed protein. Anomalous and dispersive difference Pattersons revealed the presence of four selenium sites. Solvent-flattened multiple anomalous dispersion phases to 2.3 Å revealed an exceptionally clear electron density map with no significant breaks in the main chain. A portion of the electron density map is shown in Figure 3. The structure was refined to 2.3 Å resolution with an R-factor of 20.3% and a free R-factor of 22.3%. Further details of the structure determination and refinement are described in Tables 1 and 2 and Material and Methods. OVerView of the Structure. S. aureus MurB is composed of three domains (Figures 4 and 5). Domains 1 and 2 are

average B-factor 28.4 36.6 23.6 29.0

responsible for binding of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor while domain 3 is responsible for substrate binding. The rms deviation for all CR atoms (236 residues out of the 326 S. aureus residues) in common between the E. coli and S. aureus structures is 2.20 Å (Figure 6, panel a). Superpositions for each of the three domains in S. aureus as compared to their respective domains in the E. coli enzyme resulted in slightly better superpositions for domains 2 and 3 (Figure 6, panels b-d). Domain 1 (residues 14-98) of S. aureus MurB has a rms deviation of 2.20 Å for the CR atoms as compared to E. coli MurB. The second domain of S. aureus MurB (residues 101-229) has a rms deviation of 1.80 Å for the CR atoms of the corresponding residues in E. coli MurB. The rms deviation for domain 3 of the S. aureus enzyme (residues 230-316) is 1.05 Å for the CR atoms corresponding

to the portion of this domain present in the E. coli structure. While the overall fold of the S. aureus MurB enzyme is similar to that of E. coli MurB, several exceptions indicate that the S. aureus MurB structure represents a significant structural variation for the UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductases. The first major difference is the additional 32 amino acids that are present at the N-terminus of S. aureus MurB that are not present in the E. coli enzyme. While only 18 of these amino acids are observed in the electron density map (the remaining 14 amino acids are disordered), these residues form an additional R helix (RA) and strand ( A) at the beginning of the peptide chain. (Similar secondary structure elements in S. aureus MurB have been given the corresponding names from E. coli MurB

(23) to facilitate the discussion and new elements of secondary structure have been assigned lettered names). The A strand adds an antiparallel strand to the central parallel -barrel that forms the base of domain 1. This -barrel has an extremely hydrophobic core burying the side chains of residues Leu 37, Leu 78, Ile 84, Ile 86, Ile 91, Val 95, and Ile 312. The second major structural difference in S. aureus MurB is the absence of the loop between 13 and R3 (residues 183 to 203 of E. coli MurB). To compensate for the loss of this loop, an additional turn of helix is added to R3 to make the connection between 13 and R3 in S. aureus MurB. This loop serves an important role in E. coli MurB by positioning Tyr 190 to interact directly with the R phosphate of the EPUDPGlcNAc ligand and to close the active site upon

substrate binding (45). Observations of the S. aureus MurB structure do not reveal any direct substitutes for Tyr 190 suggesting that this specific mechanism for substrate binding observed in E. coli MurB is not utilized in the S. aureus

enzyme. In the E. coli MurB structure, the R phosphate of the EP-UDPGlcNAc also interacts with the side chain of Lys 217. This residue is conserved in the S. aureus MurB structure as residue Lys 228. Therefore, one would expect

2346 Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 8, 2001 that the absence of Tyr 190 would lead to an increased importance for Lys 228 in the formation of a productive enzyme-substrate complex in S. aureus MurB. The third major structural difference is the deletion of a portion of the substrate binding domain in the S. aureus MurB protein structure. One of the R + motifs present in the E. coli structure, the single split R fold ( 14, R4, 15, 16) is absent in the S. aureus MurB structure. This portion of the E. coli structure provides several van der Waals contacts with the EP-UDPGlcNAc ligand. In the absence of this portion of the substrate binding domain, the ligand binding surface on S. aureus MurB is notably more narrow. Several minor differences in the main chain between the two structures are also observed. First, in the E. coli MurB, two residues in 5 and 6 are not found in the S. aureus MurB structure resulting in two shorter -strands for the S. aureus enzyme. Second, the hydrogen bonding distances and geometries for residues 143-151 in S. aureus MurB are consistent with a secondary structure assignment of an R-helix (RB) for these residues in the core of the protein. This same region in the E. coli structure (residues 113121) shows secondary structure similar to an R-helix with allowed and  angles, but with poor hydrogen bonding distances and geometries; therefore, this region was not assigned as an R-helix in the original E. coli MurB structure (23). Third, a single residue deletion in the S. aureus structure occurs in the loop between 9 and 10 leading to a shorter connection between these two strands. Finally, the last -strand ( 21) and R-helix (R7) in the E. coli MurB structure are not observed in the S. aureus MurB structure. The exact secondary structure of these residues is unknown since the last nine residues of the C terminus of S. aureus MurB are disordered in the electron density map. FlaVin Cofactor Binding. The conserved protein fold of MurB in the S. aureus enzyme is particularly pronounced for the flavin binding portion of the molecule (domains 1 and 2, Figure 6, panels b and c). Not only is the flavin binding fold conserved, but also the conformation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide ligand is nearly identical between the two structures (rms deviation for all of the cofactor atoms comparing the S. aureus FAD and the E. coli FAD is 0.30 Å). This FAD binding fold in both MurB structures is a member of a new superfamily of flavin adenine dinucleotide binding proteins (46). The other members of this FAD binding protein family for which protein structures have been solved include p-cresol methylhydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida (47), vanillyl-alcohol oxidase from Penicllium simplicissimum (48), and CO dehydrogenase from Oligotropha carboxidoVorans (49). The protein side chain and main chain interactions with the FAD cofactor found in the S. aureus enzyme are mostly similar to those interactions observed in E. coli MurB. The N5 and O4 of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin adenine dinucleotide interact with the guanidinium moiety of Arg 225 in a manner similar to that observed for Arg 214 in the E. coli MurB structure (Figure 7). The sequence and positional conservation of this arginine in the structure suggests that it plays a role in the binding of the flavin and stabilization of the reduced cofactor during catalysis. Two other interactions to the isoalloxazine ring (N3 and O2) are maintained by the main chain nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen of Gly 153. Interactions with the ribityl sugar moiety are

Residues for the S. aureus enzyme are indicated adjacent to the amino acid and the corresponding residues for the E. coli enzyme are shown in parentheses. Distances that would allow hydrogen bonds with the FAD are shown as dotted lines.

also similar to those observed in the E. coli MurB. The carbonyl oxygen of Pro 141 and the hydroxyl group of Ser 82 make hydrogen bonds to the first hydroxyl group and the carbonyl of Gly 146 interacts with the third hydroxyl moiety. The extensive interactions between the protein and the diphosphoadenine portion of the molecule are also well conserved with the main chain atoms of residues 79-83 that include the Gly-X-Gly motif found in the Rossmann fold (50) and provide important stabilizing interactions with the two phosphates. Two serines (Ser 82 and Ser 143) again serve to make specific contacts with the phosphate moiety but using a geometry different from E. coli MurB. The placement of Ser 82 is conserved with respect to its counterpart in E. coli MurB (Ser 50), but Ser 143 is three residues away (one turn of R-helix B) from the position corresponding to the E. coli MurB Ser 116. While this places the serine hydroxyl on the opposite site of the phosphate (when compared to the E. coli MurB), the hydrogen bonding interaction is maintained. Finally, two residues make contacts to the 3-hydroxyl of the ribityl sugar, Tyr 149 and Arg 310. The corresponding residues in E. coli MurB for Tyr 149 is Ile 149 that does not make any hydrogen bonds to the ribityl sugar but does make hydrophobic interactions with this part of the flavin. The substitution of tyrosine in S. aureus MurB at this position allows for both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts. ActiVe Site Arrangement and Implications for Substrate Binding. The electron density map in the active site of S. aureus MurB reveals regions of disconnected electron density that did not clearly resemble the EP-UDPGlcNAc substrate despite the presence of the substrate in the crystallization conditions.

Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 8, 2001 2347 a dramatic motion upon EP-UDPGlcNAc binding. The absence of this loop and its key residue in the S. aureus structure suggests that ligand binding in this bacterial species has adapted to compensate for the loss of Tyr 190. The Km for EP-UDPGlcAc with S. aureus MurB is 15 µM, while the Km for NADPH is 40 µM (S. Swaney, personal communication) which are of the same magnitude as the Km values for EP-UDPGlcNAc and NADPH with E. coli MurB (6). These kinetic parameters suggest that the loss of Tyr 190 has little impact on the enzyme's ability to bind either substrate. It is also possible that charged residues from other parts of the molecule could play a role in ligand binding. Interestingly, the other significant deletion also involves a part of the enzyme involved in substrate binding, the single split R fold ( 14, R4, 15, and 16 in E. coli MurB). This portion of protein structure has a less specific purpose in the mechanism of action of MurB but does serve to provide a surface on which the uridine portion of the EPUDPGlcNAc substrate rests. Although a three-dimensional NMR structure of the NADPH-E. coli MurB complex was never reported, backbone assignments from an E. coli MurB-NADPH complex indicate the single split R fold is also important for NADPH binding (51-52). This observation is consistent with the steady-state kinetic characterization that the E. coli MurB catalyzes reduction of the enolpyruvyl group by a ping pong mechanism where both NADPH and EP-UDPGlcNAc utilize the same binding site (53). Although the MurB crystals were grown in the presence of the substrate EP-UDPGlcNAc, no interpretable electron density for the substrate was observed. The failure to obtain a substrate complex could be either the result of weak substrate binding to the enzyme under the conditions necessary for crystallization or the result of crystallization conditions which select for a protein conformation that excludes substrate. Monitoring ligand binding by UV-visible spectroscopy shows the expected red shift of the flavin absorption spectrum associated with EP-UDPGlcNAc as observed with the E. coli MurB enzyme (54) suggesting that the substrate should be bound to the oxidized form of the S. aureus MurB. When the initial crystals did not show the presence of substrate in the active site, higher concentrations of substrate were employed in an attempt to produce a substrate complex. Since the original crystallization buffer was at pH 6.5, crystals were also grown at pH 8.0 within the optimal pH range for the S. aureus MurB enzymatic activity. Unfortunately, neither of these changes nor additional crystallization screening efforts identified any crystallization conditions that would support both crystallization of the protein and binding of EP-UDPGlcNAc. Analysis of the packing in the crystal lattice reveals that a symmetry related molecule protrudes into the active site of S. aureus MurB in this crystal. Specifically, two strands of the major -sheet ( 5 and 6) are situated at the active site opening where the EP-UDPGlcNAc binding site is located. Superimposing the E. coli EP-UDPGlcNAc bound structure on the S. aureus MurB structure indicates that these strands from the symmetry related molecule would interfere with the binding of the uridine portion of the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the crystal form which is favored during crystallization selects a protein conformation of S. aureus MurB that prevents EP-UDPGlcNAc binding.

in the active site cannot be determined at this time. Comparison of the S. aureus and E. coli structures reveals strict conservation of the active site residues. The three catalytic active site residues in E. coli, Arg 159 and Glu 325 that would stabilize the C2 acicarbanionic species and Ser 229 that would provide a proton to quench the intermediate, are strictly conserved in the S. aureus active site, Ser 238, Arg 188, and Glu 308 (Figure 8) (23). In addition, two residues that were shown to play a role in substrate binding in the E. coli enzyme are also strictly conserved in the active site of S. aureus MurB (Tyr 187 and Lys 288). Two other residues shown to be important for substrate binding, Asn 233 and Gln 288, are replaced in the S. aureus structure by Arg 242 and His 271, respectively. The only critical substrate binding residue that is not found in the S. aureus structure is the E. coli Tyr 190 that is absent due to the deletion of the loop between 13 and R3 in S. aureus protein as previously noted. The absence of this single residue does not appear to compromise the ability of the enzyme to bind substrate since all of the other hydrogen bond interactions observed in the E. coli MurB structure would be maintained. DISCUSSION A comparison of the two MurB structures reveals that the S. aureus MurB possesses the same general fold that was observed in the E. coli MurB structure, an R + protein with three domains. Two of these domains create a binding site for the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor and the third domain participates in substrate binding. On the basis of the high similarity between the two protein sequences, a related fold was clearly expected. Yet, it is not surprising that differences between the two structures are evident in the substrate binding regions of the enzymes, since the sequence alignment reveals regions of significant deletions. The most relevant deletions that occur in the S. aureus MurB structure involve portions of the enzyme that play an important part in the binding of EP-UDPGlcNAc (23) or NADPH (51-52) in E. coli MurB. The loop between 13 and R3 in E. coli MurB contains Tyr 190 which undergoes

Asterisks indicate the proposed active site residues involved in catalysis. Several other MurB sequences were not included in this alignment including Treponema pallidum MurB (class II MurB) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurB (class I MurB) because of additional insertions or deletions in these protein sequences that complicated the multiple sequence alignment.

Fortunately, placement of the EP-UDPGlcNAc substrate can be inferred from the E. coli MurB-EP-UDPGlcNAc structure. The active site for MurB is defined by residues that stabilize the intermediate produced when a hydride is transferred from N1 to C3 of the enolpyruvyl group and facilitate the quenching of this intermediate. On the basis of S. aureus MurB structure, a mechanism was proposed for stabilization of this acicarbanonic species by charge neutralization and/or by protonation. As in the E. coli model, two residues, Arg 188 and Glu 308, exist that could serve this mechanistic purpose. Similarly, Ser 238 corresponds to E. coli MurB Ser 229 that is proposed to serve as a general acid catalyst in conjunction with an active site water (55). The Ser 238 hydroxyl is 6.3 Å away from N1 of the FAD cofactor in the S. aureus MurB structure. Since the corresponding serine hydroxyl is similarly positioned (6.1 Å from N1) in the E. coli MurB structure, it appears that S. aureus MurB is well-positioned for reduction of the enolpyruvyl group. An analysis of available MurB sequences in Genbank provides increasing evidence that these three active site

residues play critical roles in stabilization and reduction of the C2 acicarbanion intermediate during catalysis. In the sequence alignment shown in Figure 9, the active site glutamate (Glu 308 in S. aureus MurB and Glu 325 in E. coli MurB) is strictly conserved. The active site arginine (Arg 188 in S. aureus MurB and Arg 159 in E. coli MurB) is conserved in all species with the exception of Borrelia burgdorfei MurB in which a conservative substitution to a lysine is made. The active site serine is equally well conserved across species with the only exception being the MurB sequence from Chlamydia pneumoniae where a conservative Cys substitution is present. This conservation of active site residues suggests that mechanistically the UDPN-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductases are equivalent with respect to the reduction of the enolpyruvyl group. In contrast, these sequence alignments also suggest that there are at least two structural scaffolds for the MurB family. Comparison of the sequences from Genbank reveals that the S. aureus MurB is not the only MurB sequence in which the E. coli Tyr 190 loop and the single split R fold from the substrate binding domain ( 14, R4, 15, and 16 in E.

FIGURE 10: CR backbone traces from three MurB structures (superposition based on the flavin binding domains). The two E. coli MurB structures (substrate free E. coli MurB shown as dotted lines, EP-UDPGlcNAc bound MurB shown as thin lines) show that the substrate binding domain is actually closer to the flavin binding domain in the absence of substrate than when the substrate is bound. The S. aureus MurB structure reveals the greatest displacement of the substrate binding domain from the flavin domain of the three structures.

coli MurB) are absent (Figure 9). This striking similarity among sequences indicates that many of these MurBs from other species would adopt the S. aureus MurB type threedimensional structure as opposed to the E. coli MurB type three-dimensional structure. Thus, the trend suggests that at least two distinct classes of MurB protein structures exist, that of the E. coli type (type I MurB) and that of the S. aureus type (type II MurB), which distinguishes the construction of the substrate binding domain and the manner in which these enzymes bind their substrates. This classification of two types of MurB consists not only of secondary structural elements that are present or absent but also of how these structural elements define a mode of substrate binding. A comparison of the substrate domain positions between S. aureus MurB and the two forms of E. coli MurB (substrate free and EP-UDPGlcNAc bound forms) is shown in Figure 10. This superposition reveals that S. aureus MurB's substrate binding domain is notably more displaced from domains 1 and 2 in either of the substrate free or the EP-UDPGlcNAc bound forms of E. coli MurB. While interactions between crystallographically related molecules hold domain 3 in this open conformation, this displacement reveals the flexibility of the enzyme to achieve an open conformation of the S. aureus enzyme with ready access to the ligand binding site. A comparison of the E. coli ligand bound and ligand free structure also reveals flexibility of the position of domain 3 with respect to domains 1 and 2. The flexibility of domain 3 in E. coli MurB enables ligand binding by an indirect mechanism involving the movement of domain 3 away from the flavin binding domain leading to the disruption of the stacking interaction between Tyr 190 and Tyr 254. This motion allows Tyr 190 to adopt a new rotameric configuration that provides a hydrogen bond to the R phosphate and closes off the active site from the solvent (45). In the absence of a residue homologus to Tyr 190 and the loss of the single split R fold ( 14, R4, 15, and 16 in E. coli MurB), stabilization of the complex must occur by a different mechanism. This process in S. aureus MurB most likely involves movement of domain 3 toward the flavin binding domains to hold the substrate in place and

close off the active site from solvent during catalysis. The structure of S. aureus MurB demonstrates the subtle yet significant differences that exist among functionally equivalent proteins of various bacterial species. This structure demonstrates the importance of conducting structural and biochemical analysis on the target from the bacterial species of interest to facilitate meaningful drug discovery where the closest possible fit of inhibitor to enzyme is desired. Efforts to identify inhibitors for S. aureus UDP-N-acetylglucosamine reductase are ongoing. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We gratefully acknowledge N-terminal sequencing and amino acid analysis conducted by John G.
