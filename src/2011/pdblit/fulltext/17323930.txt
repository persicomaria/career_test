ABSTRACT: Coenzyme A (CoASH) is the major low-molecular weight thiol in Staphylococcus aureus and a number of other bacteria; the crystal structure of the S. aureus coenzyme A-disulfide reductase (CoADR), which maintains the reduced intracellular state of CoASH, has recently been reported [Mallett, T.C., Wallen, J.R., Karplus, P.A., Sakai, H., Tsukihara, T., and Claiborne, A. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 1127889]. In this report we demonstrate that CoASH is the major thiol in Bacillus anthracis; a bioinformatics analysis indicates that three of the four proteins responsible for the conversion of pantothenate (Pan) to CoASH in Escherichia coli are conserved in B. anthracis. In contrast, a novel type III pantothenate kinase (PanK) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway in B. anthracis; unlike the E. coli type I PanK, this enzyme is not subject to feedback inhibition by CoASH. The crystal structure of B. anthracis PanK (BaPanK), solved using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data and refined at a resolution of 2.0 Å, demonstrates that BaPanK is a new member of the Acetate and Sugar Kinase/Hsc70/ Actin (ASKHA) superfamily. The Pan and ATP substrates have been modeled into the active-site cleft; in addition to providing a clear rationale for the absence of CoASH inhibition, analysis of the Panbinding pocket has led to the development of two new structure-based motifs (the PAN and INTERFACE motifs). Our analyses also suggest that the type III PanK in the spore-forming B. anthracis plays an essential role in the novel thiol/disulfide redox biology of this category A biodefense pathogen.

CoASH has been classified as a "common" thiol (1), as it occurs in all prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes. Although GSH plays the central role in maintaining thiol/disulfide

homeostasis and providing an important line of antioxidant defense in, for example, Escherichia coli (2), GSH is clearly absent in a number of bacteria (3, 4) as well as all archaea (5, 6). CoASH has been shown to be the major low-molecular weight thiol in the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (7) and Borrelia burgdorferi (8), in the spore-forming Bacillus megaterium (4) and the radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans (3), and in the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus (6) and other archaea. Coenzyme A-disulfide reductases (CoADR)1 have been characterized in most of these prokaryotes (4, 7-9), reinforcing the concept that CoASH assumes the intracellular redox function of GSH in these organisms, and the crystal structure of the S. aureus CoADR has recently been reported (10). In E. coli, pantothenate kinase (CoaA, or type I PanK)2 is the key regulatory enzyme in CoASH biosynthesis (Scheme 1); kinetic analysis supports an ordered sequential mecha1 Abbreviations: CoADR, coenzyme A-disulfide reductase; CoaA, type I pantothenate kinase; PanK, pantothenate kinase; EcPanK, Escherichia coli pantothenate kinase; AMPPNP, 5-adenylimidodiphosphate; Pan, pantothenate; N5-Pan, N-pentylpantothenamide; SaPanK, Staphylococcus aureus pantothenate kinase; BsPanK, Bacillus subtilis pantothenate kinase; PaPanK, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pantothenate kinase; TmPanK, Thermotoga maritima pantothenate kinase; mBBr, monobromobimane; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; BaPanK, Bacillus anthracis pantothenate kinase; SeMet, selenomethionine; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion; TIGR, The Institute for Genomic Research; ASKHA, Acetate and Sugar Kinase/Hsc70/Actin.

nism, with ATP binding first (11, 12). CoASH is a competitive feedback inhibitor (Ki ) 4.3 µM) with respect to ATP (13), and crystal structures are available for the EcPanK complexes with CoASH and with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP, respectively (12), as well as for the ternary complex with ADP and Pan (14). There are now three types of bacterial PanK enzymes; the type I PanK found in E. coli is a P-loop kinase [kinase family and fold group 2 (15)], and Pan binding leads to a significant conformational change, resulting in closure of a "lid" over the bound substrate (14). EcPanK effectively phosphorylates the Pan antimetabolites (alternate substrates) N-pentyl- and N-heptylpantothenamide; Km values are only 3-fold higher than that of the natural substrate (14). The phosphorylated products are carried through the CoASH biosynthetic pathway, resulting in the accumulation of inactive holo-acyl carrier protein (16). Modeling studies indicate that the pantothenamides can orient into the Pan binding site, with their extended alkyl chains interacting with a hydrophobic "dome" over the substrate pocket. In 2005, the bacterial type II and type III PanKs were identified in S. aureus (17), and in Helicobacter pylori and Bacillus subtilis (18), respectively. Neither isoform is similar in sequence to the type I EcPanK, nor is either subject to feedback inhibition by CoASH. Analysis of the respective kinetic parameters revealed a broad range for Km(ATP) values, from 34 µM for SaPanK to 3.1 mM for BsPanK. The type III BsPanK also exhibited a 5-6-fold increase in Km(Pan) relative to EcPanK and SaPanK; this correlates with the observation that N5-Pan is neither an alternate substrate for nor a competitive inhibitor of BsPanK. Limited bioinformatics analyses suggested that both type II and type III PanKs belonged to the ribonuclease H-like family [kinase family and fold group 4 (15)] of kinases (18). Very recently, Hong et al. (19) and Yang et al. (20) have confirmed these
2 The bacterial and eukaryotic pantothenate kinases have traditionally been distinguished as the CoaA and PanK proteins, respectively. With the identification of two distinct new bacterial pantothenate kinase classes in 2005, different investigators have used either type I, -II, and -III CoaAs (e.g., type II Staphylococcus aureus CoaA) or PanK-I, -II, and -III nomenclature to identify the three bacterial enzyme classes. In this report we refer to the three bacterial enzyme classes as bacterial type I, type II, and type III PanKs; CoaA is synonymous with the type I PanK.

predictions with crystal structures for the type II SaPanKAMPPNP complex and for the type III PanKs from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaPanK) and Thermotoga maritima (TmPanK), as well as the PaPanK-Pan complex. Global sequence identities between PaPanK and TmPanK, respectively, and the type III PanK from the category A biodefense pathogen Bacillus anthracis are 25% and 37%. P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative aerobe that also contains the GSH/GSSG/glutathione reductase thiol/disulfide redox system (21-23); T. maritima is an anaerobic rod-shaped hyperthermophilic bacterium for which the ability to synthesize GSH has not been demonstrated (23). The CoADR enzymes, such as that from S. aureus (7, 24, 25), are a key part of the intracellular machinery for those bacteria and archaea in which CoASH serves as the major low-molecular weight thiol. Our structure-based bioinformatics analysis (10) suggests that CoADR may be a more common activity than previously recognized and one that is significantly misannotated in databases. In this report we demonstrate that CoASH is the major low-molecular weight thiol in the Grampositive facultative anaerobe B. anthracis. We also describe the crystal structure for the type III PanK from this sporeforming organism, as refined at 2.0 Å resolution. The recent report of Yang et al. (20) included a bioinformatics analysis demonstrating that the type III PanK is also widely distributed among bacteria. Here we provide an extended bioinformatics analysis that provides a genome-based link for the absence of GSH biosynthesis, the presence of the type III PanK, and the presence of CoADR-like enzymes in a number of bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and spirochetes. Taken together, these observations suggest that the CoASH-refractory type III PanK plays a special role in maintaining higher intracellular CoASH levels to accommodate additional functions for the coenzyme in thiol/ disulfide redox homeostasis in a diverse group of bacteria. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Analysis of Thiols from B. anthracis. A 1-L culture of B. anthracis Sterne was grown in Brain Heart Infusion medium (Becton, Dickinson, and Co.) and harvested in exponentialphase growth. Four pellets (0.5 mL each) were extracted with 2.5 mL of 50% acetonitrile in 20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid, pH 8, containing

3236 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 11, 2007 2 mM mBBr (Calbiochem), and incubated at 60 °C for 15 min (26). The extract was cooled on ice and acidified with 5 µL of 5 M methanesulfonic acid. The pellet was removed by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven to constant weight. Four more pellets were extracted identically, except that 5 mM NEM was substituted for mBBr. A 0.5-mL aliquot of one NEM-treated pellet was reacted with 2 mM mBBr for 15 min at 60 °C and acidified with methanesulfonic acid, as given above; this sample served as a control for the thiol samples. The remaining 2 mL of this sample was reacted with 1 equiv of -mercaptoethanol (based on NEM) and concentrated to 0.6 mL on a Speed Vac. This extract was reduced with 2 mM DTT for 20 min at 23 °C and then reacted with mBBr (8 mM overall). The sample was acidified with methanesulfonic acid prior to HPLC analysis. A DTT sample was prepared as above, without extract, to serve as a control for the disulfide sample. The extracts were analyzed following HPLC protocols 1 and 2 (26) for thiols and disulfides. Single point calibration standards were used for quantitation (50 pmol) of the bimane derivatives of Cys, N-acetyl-Cys, GSH, thiosulfate (SSO3-2), H2S, mycothiol, CoASH, 3-dephospho-CoASH, pantetheine, and 4-phosphopantetheine. The bimane derivative of CoASH hydrolyzes over time in acidic extracts to give the 3dephospho-CoASH-adduct and is quantitated as the sum of the two (CoASH + 3-dephospho-CoASH) from HPLC protocol 2. The bimane derivatives of Cys, U12 (an unidentified B. anthracis thiol), pantetheine, 4-phosphopantetheine, and H2S were best analyzed with protocol 1. Expression and Purification of BaPanK and BA2901. Genomic DNA from B. anthracis Ames was provided by Dr. Arthur Friedlander, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. B. anthracis PanK (NP_842634; "transcriptional activator, putative, Baf family") was expressed with a C-terminal His-tag provided by the pET28a plasmid vector in E. coli C41(DE3) cells. These cells were grown in a 3-L culture of tryptone-yeast extractphosphate medium (27) supplemented with 30 mM glucose and 30 µg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C. Cultures were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.9 and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. Following centrifugation at 5000g for 15 min, the washed cell pellets were resuspended in 100 mL of 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 2 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT, and lysed via disruption with a pneumatic cell homogenizer (Avestin EmulsiFlex-C5). After centrifuging at 20000g, streptomycin sulfate was added (1% w/v) to the supernatant, with stirring, for 15 min. The supernatant obtained on subsequent centrifugation was filtered and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose HP column equilibrated in 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted with a 0 f 1 M NaCl gradient in the loading buffer; fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The BaPanK pool was brought to final concentrations of 0.25 M NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with 1 M K2HPO4. The protein was loaded onto a NiNTA Superflow (Qiagen) column equilibrated in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. The His-tagged BaPanK was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 100 mM. The pure protein (calculated m ) 29 915 Da for the His-tagged BaPanK) was buffer-exchanged into 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH

Nicely et al. 8.0, containing 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM DTT and concentrated to 20 mg/mL, based on a calculated -1 -1 [ProtParam (28)]. After adding 280 ) 23 510 M cm glycerol to 25% (v/v), 1-mL aliquots were stored at -80 °C. The SeMet derivative of BaPanK was expressed from the pET28a-BaPanK vector in the E. coli B834(DE3) strain (10); cultures were grown overnight in the auto-inducing medium PASM-5052 (29). The purification protocol for SeMet BaPanK was essentially identical to that described for the native protein, except that the SeMet protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA column with 0.25 M imidazole. Yields for the native and SeMet BaPanKs were 200 and 30-35 mg/L of culture, respectively. The B. anthracis homolog (NP_845240; "hypothetical protein BA2901") of the type II SaPanK was expressed, with either N-terminal or C-terminal His-tags provided by the pET28a plasmid vector, in E. coli B834(DE3) cells. These cells were grown in tryptone-yeast extract-phosphate medium, as described above for the BaPanK expression and purification. N-terminal His-tagged BA2901 was purified in the same way as BaPanK, except that an SP-Sepharose HP column replaced the Q-Sepharose HP column in the first step, given the higher calculated pI of 8.7 for BA2901. For the C-terminal His-tagged protein, the pET28a clone was expressed in E. coli B834(DE3) at 25 °C. The protein was purified with a combination of Q-Sepharose HP and Ni-NTA column steps and was stored at -80 °C in 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4 (at 25 °C), containing 1 mM DTT and 20% glycerol (v/v). PanK Assays. The enzymatic activity of purified BaPanK was measured as recently described for PaPanK (19); the standard assay included 60 mM NH4Cl to allow for activation of the enzyme in the presence of the monovalent cation. The purified BA2901 protein was assayed following the protocol described for SaPanK (17). We also tested the ability of BA2901 to complement the E. coli mutant strain DV70 [coaA(Ts)] (30) that is unable to grow at 42 °C due to the inactivation of EcPanK. Control strains were obtained by transforming strain DV70 either with pSC4, a pET28a plasmid harboring the S. aureus coaA gene (17), or with the empty vector. All strains grew very well at 30 °C, but only pSC4/DV70 grew (36 h) at 42 °C. Crystallization and Data Collection. Thawed aliquots of the native and SeMet BaPanK proteins were bufferexchanged into 10 mM sodium N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid to give final protein concentrations of 22-24 mg/mL. The native protein as concentrated (pH 7.0) also included 50 mM KCl; the SeMet protein sample (pH 7.5) contained 10 mM KCl. Crystals were grown in 24-well sitting-drop plates over reservoirs of 0.5 mL of 24-26% ethylene glycol, in drop sizes of either 2 + 2 or 4 + 4 µL. Crystals were flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K directly after being removed from the drop. Data sets for MAD phasing were collected at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X12C. Phasing and Structure Refinement. Images in each data set were indexed, integrated, and scaled in d*TREK (31). Phasing, chain tracing, and density modification were performed with SOLVE/RESOLVE (32-34). Model refinement was carried out in CNS (35), with manual rebuilding in COOT (36). The latter stages of refinement were performed with REFMAC5 (37). The final model was

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 11, 2007 3237 metric analysis gave a mass of 398 Da for U123 (corrected for the bimane contribution); this thiol could not be identified by comparison with the retention times for known thiols as analyzed in HPLC protocols 1 and 2 (see "Experimental Procedures"). Parallel analyses for the corresponding lowmolecular weight disulfides [CoA-disulfide e0.035 µmol/g (dry residual weight)] gave an intracellular ratio of CoASH/ CoA-disulfide >50. The method used to determine disulfides involves treatment of thiol-blocked extracts with DTT, to reduce the disulfide to its thiol form for mBBr derivatization and analysis. Because DTT can also release CoASH from acyl-CoAs by transacetylation (49), the value determined in this way represents an upper limit for the disulfide content; the estimated CoASH/CoA-disulfide ratio therefore represents a lower limit. Using a value of 2 µL/mg dry weight for the cell volume, we estimate the concentration of CoASH in B. anthracis cells to be 0.44 mM. The concentration of CoASH in E. coli (1.5 µL/mg dry weight) can similarly be estimated at 0.4 mM (22). PanKs in B. anthracis. The conversion of Pan f CoASH requires three gene products, in addition to the type I PanK, in E. coli (Scheme 1): the bifunctional phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase/decarboxylase (phosphopantothenate + cysteine ff 4-phosphopantetheine; coaBC), phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (coaD), and dephospho-CoASH kinase (coaE). With specific reference to CoASH biosynthesis in B. anthracis, Gerdes et al. (50) published an analysis of potential broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug targets among cofactor biosynthetic pathways; all four coa gene products in E. coli were concluded to be individually "essential", as was the acpS gene product that synthesizes the holo-acyl carrier protein from CoASH + apoacyl carrier protein (51). Using the ERGO database and the B. anthracis Ames genome sequence, the predicted CoASH biosynthetic pathway for the anthrax pathogen was analyzed with the aid of the known E. coli pathway (50). All components of the de novo Pan biosynthetic pathway, as well as the Na+/Pan transporter, were identified (presence of the orthologous gene); similar results were found for the pathway from Pan f CoASH, except for the type I PanK. The locus identified in this case was the ortholog of the eukaryotic panK gene ["hypothetical protein BA2901" (NP_845240)], and the properties of the BA2901 protein are described below. Choudhry et al. (52) later demonstrated that the type II S. aureus PanK was closely related to BA2901 as well (35% identity), and both Choudhry et al. (52) and Genschel et al. (53) have suggested that this B. anthracis protein, which is also related to the human PanK, has likely arisen as the result of lateral gene transfer. We expressed and purified recombinant BA2901 with N- and C-terminal His-tags, respectively; the mass of the former (33.6 kDa) was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker Autoflex; sinapinic acid matrix). Both purified proteins were inactive in the in vitro PanK assay, under conditions in which the purified SaPanK is fully active. In addition, the BA2901 pET28a expression plasmid
3 A mixed disulfide form of the oxidized OhrR repressor has very recently been identified that is formed in B. subtilis cells on treatment with cumene hydroperoxide; the novel thiol component also gives a mass of 398 Da (J. Helmann, personal communication).

validated with MOLPROBITY (38) and with the built-in tools from COOT. Bioinformatics. Sequence analyses with BaPanK were performed with the NCBI (39) and SEED (40) databases using blastp. Multiple sequence alignments were performed with CLUSTALW (41). Secondary structural motifs were identified with DSSP (42), and structural homology searches were performed with the Combinatorial Extension [CE (43)] and DALI (44) web servers. Structural alignments and analyses were carried out in COOT, and structure-based sequence alignments were exported with SSM SUPERPOSE (45). The TIGR-Comprehensive Microbial Resource (46) Version 2.3 (Genomes Region Comparison tool; Data Releases through 19.0) and the Integrated Microbial Genomes Version 1.6 (phylogenetic distribution tool) were used to identify proteins similar to those in the test set, in other bacteria. The test set included E. coli GshA (NP_417173), E. coli GshB (NP_417422), Streptococcus agalactiae -glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (NP_688811), E. coli type I PanK (NP_418405), S. aureus type II PanK (NP_646871), B. subtilis type III PanK (AAW83041), and S. aureus CoADR (YP_493573). Strong evidence for homology is provided by a sequence identity of g25% (47); alignments for determining pairwise identities were performed using LALIGN [default parameters (48)]. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION CoASH in Bacillus anthracis. To analyze thiols from B. anthracis, samples were taken from a 1-L culture of B. anthracis Sterne harvested in exponential-phase growth; bimane derivatives of low-molecular weight thiols resolved by reverse phase HPLC are given in Figure 1. B. anthracis produces CoASH, cysteine, and H2S; the H2S is likely derived from iron-sulfur proteins and is not a low-molecular weight thiol. This profile is qualitatively similar to that reported for B. subtilis but differs quantitatively in the relative amounts of CoASH and cysteine. GSH, pantetheine, and 4phosphopantetheine were not detectable [e0.03 µmol/g (dry residual weight)]. Total CoASH was estimated at 0.87 ( 0.11 µmol/g (dry residual weight), very similar to the value of 1.1 ( 0.1 µmol/g (dry residual weight) reported for S. aureus (7). A new unknown thiol (U12) was also identified in the B. anthracis extract; purification and mass spectro-

failed to complement the E. coli coaA(Ts) strain DV70 under conditions where S. aureus coaA-pET28a restored growth at 42 °C. A homology model for BA2901 based on the type II SaPanK structure (19) does not provide an explanation for the observed lack of activity. No crystal structure for the SaPanK-Pan complex is available; the model described by Hong et al. (19) represents a "loose fit" for bound Pan. The critical residues involved in Pan binding have not been strictly identified or tested. Similarly, a putative mammalian PanK (PanK4) was originally identified on the basis of its very favorable comparison with the mammalian PanK1 sequence, but this protein is also inactive. We conclude that BA2901 is very likely a kinase of the ribonuclease H-like family, but Pan is not the acceptor substrate. Genetic studies already in progress4 are designed to provide a more definitive answer to this question. If BA2901 does lack compensating PanK activity, deletion of the BA0065 locus should be lethal to B. anthracis Sterne (see below). The absence of a type I PanK (and perhaps a functional type II enzyme as well, see above) in B. anthracis is distinct from the situation in B. subtilis and Bacillus halodurans, where functional type I and III enzymes are found (18, 54). In B. subtilis, deletion of the coaX (type III) gene gave a normal growing phenotype, but coaX could not be deleted from a strain containing a coaA deletion; these results suggested that simultaneous deletion of both genes was lethal to B. subtilis. The B. anthracis Ames genome (55) also yields a type III PanK homolog, annotated as "putative Baf family transcriptional activator BA0065" (NP_842634), which is 76% identical to the functional BsPanK. Of those bacterial species referred to earlier, known to lack GSH and containing CoASH as their major low-molecular weight thiol, B. burgdorferi, D. radiodurans, and B. megaterium5 all have type III PanK homologs (20); all lack both type I and II PanK genes. All members of the Bacillus cereus group lack coaA orthologs, and all completed genomes of this group (B. anthracis, B. cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis) contain type III PanK homologs 95-100% identical to that of the B. anthracis Ames strain. The bacterial type II and III PanK enzymes examined thus far are refractory to inhibition by CoASH (17-19), suggesting that bacteria dependent on CoASH as the major intracellular thiol tend to possess CoASH biosynthetic pathways insensitive to feedback inhibition.

The C-terminal His-tagged BA0065 protein (BaPanK) was expressed and purified from recombinant E. coli; in contrast to the BA2901 protein, BaPanK is active in the in vitro enzyme assay, as examined in parallel with the type III PaPanK. BaPanK gives 60% conversion of D[1-14C]pantothenate to 4-phosphopantothenate under conditions where PaPanK gives 40% conversion. Structure Solution of BaPanK. The structure of B. anthracis PanK was solved by three-wavelength MAD phasing with the SeMet-substituted protein. Statistics for the data sets and final structure model are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Ten Se sites were identified, and the experimental MAD-phased electron density map calculated at 2.0 Å showed continuous electron density for the protein backbone, with the exception of a stretch of seven residues (Arg164-Arg170), and allowed identification of most side chain positions. The 2Fo - Fc map in the region of the PHOSPHATE1 motif (see below) also illustrates the accuracy of the final refined model (Figure 2). The C-terminus, including residues Asn255-Glu262 plus the His6 tag, is not visible in the electron density map; the model is truncated at Ala254. The crystal structure of BaPanK has one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Residues 164-170 are part of a long loop spanning residues Ser163-Asn183; the length of this loop, its location on the surface of the protein, and the absence of electron density for a part of it suggest that the entire loop is flexible. Yang et al. (20) have described the equivalent loop in TmPanK as comprising the "Pan cap."

FIGURE 3: Elements involved in BaPanK dimerization, in stereo. Prime symbols designate secondary structural units in domain II [of monomer B (cyan), in this case]; lettered designations (e.g., Ra) indicate insertions relative to the shared core fold. These monomer B elements are overlaid with a surface representation (color-coded by electrostatic potential) of monomer A. The segment 164-170 missing electron density in monomer B is part of the long loop (163-183) connecting Ra and R1 in an area above the monomer A Pan-binding pocket.

The two constituent monomers of the BaPanK dimer are related by crystallographic symmetry (a 2-fold rotation axis). Each monomer interacts with the other through a region consisting of 3, Ra, R1, and the C-terminal part of the loop between a and 310b (Figure 3). As expected, structural superpositions with the BaPanK monomer and either PaPanK (19) or TmPanK (20) reveal nearly identical folds for the three type III PanKs; CR rmsd values of 2.1 and 1.6 Å result with the respective A monomers (for 217 and 232 atoms, respectively). The type III PanKs have been identified as members of the ASKHA kinase superfamily [ribonuclease H-like, group 4 (15)]. Figure 4 gives a structure-based sequence alignment for the five known functional type III PanKs. As described, all share the three major sequencestructure motifs (56) attributed to the ASKHA superfamily (PHOSPHATE1, PHOSPHATE2, and ADENOSINE), as well as the interdomain helix-to-helix CONNECT elements (Ala116 and Gly245 in BaPanK). The three major ASKHA motifs correspond to elements involved in ATP recognition and binding as well as divalent metal coordination for the relevant phosphotransferase (PanK) activity (15, 56). PAN and INTERFACE Motifs. BaPanK has few insertions to its core ASKHA fold. Other members of the ASKHA superfamily, including the type II SaPanK (17) and the eukaryotic PanKs (15), have several such insertions that adopt structures and motifs responsible for the formation of unique substrate-binding sites. Based on the structure for the PaPanK-Pan complex [2F9W (19)], a model of the BaPanKPan complex was developed. Most of the interactions

between protein and Pan occur with residues that are outside the ASKHA motifs; two insertions to the core fold in BaPanK merit special attention. Broadly speaking, Pan binds in a pocket formed between 3 and the loop connecting 310b and R3 (Figure 5); this loop bears the conserved residues Gly107, Asp109, and Arg110 [the hGhDR sequence; h ) hydrophobic (Figure 4)] and constitutes the new PAN motif. Strand 3 bears the conserved residues Gly147, Gly148, and Ile150, which play roles in Pan binding, as well as Pro152 and Gly153, which are important in the context of the dimer interface; together, these residues constitute the new INTERFACE motif [the GGxIxPG sequence (Figure 4)]. These new PAN and INTERFACE motifs are found in all type III PanK proteins (Figure S1) and serve to distinguish this from other ASKHA families; an inspection of the eukaryotic PanK family alignment (15) reveals that the PAN and INTERFACE motifs are unique to the type III sequences. BaPanK Asp109 forms side chain hydrogen bonds to the Pan C2- and C4-hydroxyls (Figure 6); this Asp is conserved within the PAN motif in the type III PanK sequences. BaPanK Gly107-N [this Gly is also conserved within the PAN motif (Figure 4)] forms a hydrogen bond with the Pan C1-carboxylate. In addition, the absence of a side chain here avoids a potential steric clash with the bound substrate. BaPanK Arg110 of the PAN motif (conserved in all known functional type III PanKs) and Tyr100 also interact with the Pan carboxylate. The Asp109 and Arg110 side chain rotamers, which form hydrogen bonds with Asp6 and Thr135, respectively, in the apoenzyme, are adjusted in the

FIGURE 4: Structure-based sequence alignment for BaPanK and four known functional type III PanKs (references given in the text). Structures have now been determined for BaPanK (this work), PaPanK (19), and TmPanK (20). Residue numbering and assignments correspond to BaPanK and include the 164-170 segment for which electron density is absent. This segment constitutes a part of the loop (extending through Asn183) that exhibits different conformations in the three structures. Red and yellow blocks correspond to conserved residues and conservative substitutions, respectively. ASKHA motifs are highlighted in green boxes (Ala116 and Gly245 represent CONNECT1 and CONNECT2 elements), and the new PAN and INTERFACE motifs, as well as Thr184, are highlighted in magenta boxes. Blue underscores represent residues involved in direct contacts across the dimer interface.

BaPanK-Pan model to optimize the interactions with bound Pan. Inspection of the TmPanK structure (20) and the TmPanK-Pan model reveals that a change in the apoenzyme Arg106 rotamer would also be necessary for optimization of that Pan-binding interaction. Within the INTERFACE motif, Gly147 and Gly148 provide space at the end of the binding pocket for the Pan carboxylate. Any side chain at either of these positions would produce steric clashes with the bound Pan. Ile150 makes van der Waals contacts with bound Pan, but Pro152 and Gly153 are conserved, not for Pan binding, but for their roles in dimerization as described earlier. Conserved regions in the type II SaPanK (17) and the eukaryotic PanKs (15) do not correlate with either the PAN or INTERFACE motifs; Hong et al. (19) have demonstrated that, although the SaPanK and PaPanK monomers have similar structures (SSM SUPERPOSE gives a CR rmsd ) 2.9-3.1 Å for 195 atoms), the respective homodimers assemble with distinctly different architectures. The SaPanK-Pan model suggests that Glu70, which is structurally equivalent to PaPanK Asp101, interacts

with the Pan C4-OH; this Glu residue does not, however, appear within any PAN-like motif. SaPanK Arg113, implicated in contact with the Pan C1-carboxylate, follows by 43 residues in the sequence (in contrast to the hGhDR motif in the type III PanKs). Further inspection of the SaPanK sequence reveals that Arg113 is followed closely by Gly115Gly116; these Gly residues are structurally equivalent to the conserved Gly147-Gly148 pair described for the INTERFACE motif of the type III PanKs. In the context of the dimer, the importance of another region in the type III PanKs becomes apparent; this region represents a unique insertion element, as compared with the type II SaPanK. The segment corresponding to BaPanK Leu161-Val180 (TmPanK 159178 and PaPanK 153-176) is observed to exhibit different conformations in the three structures (Figure 7). Helix Ra is present in all three structures to some degree, but the subsequent loop leading to helix R1 shows significant differences. Similarly, residues 164-170 lack electron density in the BaPanK structure. Yang et al. (20) describe several residues in this region as part of the "Pan cap" that

contributes to the conserved hydrophobic pocket described earlier (including elements of the INTERFACE motif) that accommodates the two C3-methyl groups of bound Pan. This cap is also proposed to protect the Pan-binding sitesand the bound Pan substratesfrom solvent. The differential ordering/disordering of this region in the three distinct type III PanK structures cannot be explained in the context of the respective crystal lattices. Furthermore, the ordering of the region in monomer B of the apo-PaPanK structure (versus its disordering in monomer A) is nearly identical to that seen in both monomers of the PaPanK-Pan structure, so the conformational differences cannot be explained by the simple absence or presence of bound substrate. These observations have led to a preliminary examination of the conformational dynamics for the Pan cap. Our structural model for the BaPanK-Pan complex is stable

under energy minimization.6 In the same short molecular dynamics simulations, the Pan substrate diffuses out of its binding site in the BaPanK dimer, suggesting that the unresolved loop nearby plays a role in binding the substrate. In addition to local rearrangements expected in the active site on Pan binding, domain closure may play a role in strengthening the interactions within the enzyme-substrate complex, as well as in excluding solvent from the phosphotransferase reaction center. A conserved Thr residue near this flexible region shows a specific interaction with the bound Pan. In the model of the BaPanK-Pan complex, though a large part of the long loop is missing electron density, Thr184 is in nearly the same relative position as PaPanK Thr180 (Figure 6), suggesting that this residue is conserved to stabilize Pan in its binding site. Thr180 of PaPanK monomer B forms a hydrogen bond with the Pan carboxylate bound to monomer A. Interactions with CoASH. CoASH is an important feedback inhibitor of the type I PanK, exhibiting a Ki of 4.3 µM (13); binding is competitive with respect to ATP, and crystal structures of the EcPanK-AMPPNP and -CoASH complexes (12) demonstrated that the R- and -phosphates of CoASH occupy the same site as the - and -phosphates of ATP. In both cases, Lys101 is essential in mediating the interactions with the phosphate moieties (11). His177, Phe247, and Arg106 are unique and essential to CoASH binding and inhibition; H177Q, F247V, and R106A EcPanK mutants are all refractory to any inhibition at [CoASH] e 160 µM, nor do the mutants bind CoASH in equilibrium dialysis experiments (57). In the crystal structure of the EcPanK-CoASH complex, the CoASH -mercaptoethylamido moiety extends into the hydrophobic dome over the Pan-binding pocket; the same hydrophobic residues that interact with the extended alkyl chain of N5-Pan also form the binding groove for the

-mercaptoethylamido moiety of CoASH (12). The thiol group is tightly sealed from solvent by weakly polar interactions with four aromatic residues from the hydrophobic dome and also participates in a hydrogen bond with the CoASH adenine 6-NH2 group. Although many of the protein elements defined in the EcPanK-CoASH interaction are absent in BaPanK, the most direct explanation for the failure of the type III PanKs to exhibit feedback inhibition by CoASH lies in the tight Panbinding pocket seen in the BaPanK-Pan model (Figure 7). The absence of the hydrophobic dome results in an inability to accommodate the -mercaptoethylamido moiety of CoASH, in parallel with the failure to accommodate the alkyl substituents of N5-Pan and N-heptylpantothenamide. An identical conclusion regarding the absence of CoASH inhibition with the type III TmPanK has recently been given by Yang et al. (20). As the type II SaPanK Pan-binding pocket is fully exposed and can bind the pantothenamides (19), other factors must explain the resistance of SaPanK to CoASH feedback inhibition. The biological consequences of these analyses are considered in the following section. Type III PanKs and CoASH-Dependent Redox Biology. In the specific case of S. aureus, GSH is absent, as described earlier (7). CoASH is the major intracellular thiol, and a unique NADPH-dependent CoADR functions to maintain the appropriate intracellular thiol/disulfide redox balance, analogous to the GSH/GSSG/glutathione reductase system in E. coli (10, 24, 25); in S. aureus, the ratio of CoASH/CoAdisulfide is about 450. The presence of the type II PanK in S. aureus (17, 19), which is refractory to inhibition by CoASH, allows CoASH levels to rise to an upper limit (calculated to be 0.55 mM) likely controlled only by the supply of Pan, thus contributing to this organism's unique CoASH-dependent redox biology. Bacterial type II PanK homologs have been identified only in Staphylococcus, in the B. cereus group, and in Oceanobacillus iheyensis (20). In this work, however, we have been unable to demonstrate the catalytic ATP-dependent phosphorylation of Pan in vitro, using two different His-tagged versions of the purified recombinant type II PanK homolog from B. anthracis (BA2901), nor does the BA2901 expression plasmid complement the temperature-sensitive E. coli coaA mutant strain DV70. Our working conclusion for B. anthracis is that the type III PanK may represent the sole functional enzyme for

synthesis of 4-phosphopantothenate; genetic studies already in progress4 are designed to provide a conclusive answer to this question. The bioinformatics analysis of Copley and Dhillon (23), combined with biochemical analyses reported by the Fahey laboratory over the past 30 years (1), demonstrate that GSH biosynthesis is found "only rarely" in Gram-positive bacteria. The demonstration that functional CoADR enzymes are present in S. aureus (7), in B. megaterium (4) and B. anthracis,7 and in B. burgdorferi (8) correlates perfectly with the presence of CoASH as the major low-molecular weight thiol, and with the presence of a type II or type III PanK. In B. megaterium spores (58), 43% of the total CoASH was shown to be present as soluble protein-SSCoA disulfides; >75% of this protein-SSCoA disulfide pool was reduced within the first minutes of germination. Two likely functions for these protein-SSCoA disulfides were considered: (1) reversible inactivation of key thiol-dependent spore enzymes, maintaining metabolic dormancy in the spore and (2) reversible protection of labile protein thiols in the spore, thereby contributing to heat and radiation resistance. The protein-SSCoA disulfide pool in vegetative B. megaterium accounted for <2% of the total CoASH but increased dramatically to 45% of the total CoASH during sporulation. Formation and reduction of these protein-SSCoA disulfides (during spore formation and germination, respectively) has been attributed to a CoASH-mediated redox control process. The effective absence of reduced pyridine nucleotides (NADH and NADPH) in dormant spores of B. megaterium (59) corresponds to a dramatic decrease in the intracellular [CoASH]/[CoA-disulfide] redox state, which corresponds in turn to maximal protein-SSCoA disulfide formation. The rapid accumulation of NADH during the first minutes of spore germination (59) has been proposed to lead to reduction of the protein-SSCoA disulfide pool, either directly by a CoADR-like enzyme or indirectly, via a CoASH-mediated process (4). The potential importance of such a CoASH-mediated germination control mechanism in B. anthracis is clear, as spore germination and outgrowth are fundamental to proliferation (60). The analysis of the transcriptome activated

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 11, 2007 3243 is the major low-molecular weight thiol in Streptomyces coelicolor and other streptomycetes (22), the level of intracellular CoASH is similar to that in S. aureus. CoADRlike proteins (E values ) 4e-41-6e-39) are present in both S. coelicolor and Streptomyces aVermitilis, suggesting a redundancy in low-molecular weight thiol/disulfide redox systems for this organism. As CoASH has been identified as an important component of the sporulation process in B. megaterium (see above), the CoASH/CoA-disulfide/CoADR system may also function in spore formation for streptomycetes. In a parallel analysis, using the Integrated Microbial Genomes resource (65), 14 phylogenetic classes of bacteria (among the 30 classes analyzed) were identified as lacking the three marker proteins for GSH biosynthesis (GshA, GshB, and -glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase), and we conclude that these organisms lack the ability to synthesize GSH. All 14 classes also lack the type I PanK, and 13 of these classes have the CoASH-refractory type III PanK; eight classes have both the type III PanK and a CoADR-like protein. It should, of course, be emphasized that other important bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been demonstrated to contain millimolar levels of GSH (22); still they express only the type III PanK (19, 20). Analysis of the Helicobacter pylori genome has been reported to reveal the absence of gshA, gor, and grx genes (66), implying the lack of a GSH/GSSG/glutathione reductase thiol/disulfide redox system. Thus, of the five known functional type III PanKs, only one is derived from a GSHdependent microorganism (P. aeruginosa).

during growth and sporulation of B. anthracis Sterne has provided additional support for this hypothesis (61). The coaX gene encoding BaPanK is up-regulated in wave II, as is the coaD locus encoding phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase; the coaBC and coaE genes corresponding to the bifunctional phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase/decarboxylase and dephospho-CoASH kinase, respectively, are up-regulated in waves I and III. Bergman et al. (61) have suggested that, because waves I and II are the phases of the B. anthracis life cycle that occur within the infected host, genes up-regulated specifically within this temporal frame may be particularly useful as therapeutic targets. The B. anthracis CoADR (BA1263) and CoADR-rhodanese homology domain (BA0774) proteins were expressed in waves III and V, respectively, and the presence of CoADR in the fractured spore was confirmed by proteomics analysis (62). At least four gene products essential for biosynthesis of the CoASH precursors Pan (BA1562, BA1563, and BA1564) and cysteine (BA1831) were also expressed in wave V. As described by Bergman et al. (61), waves IV and V seem to represent the final stages of sporulation in B. anthracis and include a large number of sporulation-associated loci as well as loci involved in oxidative stress responses. In collaboration with Dr. Jacques Ravel of TIGR, we have undertaken a bioinformatics analysis using (1) the E. coli gshA and gshB genes (23), along with the bifunctional -glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (SAG1821) gene from Streptococcus agalactiae (63), (2) the S. aureus CoADR gene (24), and (3) the E. coli type I (64), S. aureus type II (17), and B. subtilis type III (18) PanK genes, together with the TIGR Comprehensive Microbial Resource (version 2.3; Data Releases through 19.0). Table 3 lists those bacteria (genomes available as of April, 2006) that lack the ability to synthesize GSH, contain a type II or type III PanK, and contain a CoADR-like protein. Of the 27 species represented, for which we conclude that a CoASHdependent redox biology pertains, only the four staphylococcal species lack the type III PanK. The absence of GSH has been confirmed for seven of the 27 species, and CoASH is known to be the major low-molecular weight thiol in six of these. It is of interest to note that even though mycothiol
