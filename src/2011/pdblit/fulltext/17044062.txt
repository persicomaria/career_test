Introduction. The thioredoxin system plays a key role in the cell response to oxidative stress. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the model organism where that response has been the most comprehensively investigated, yet no structure of its three thioredoxins is available. We present here the crystal structure of Trx2, an ° isoform located at the cytoplasm and nucleus, at 2.38 A resolution. Although similar to those of the homologues from other organisms, Trx2 forms a distinctive pseudodimer, indicative of the diversity of thioredoxin quaternary structure during evolution. The dimer formation may be important to protect the cysteine residues at the active site. To keep the cellular reduction/oxidation (redox) homeostasis, it is very important for the cell to function properly throughout its life cycle. There are two systems to maintain this homeostasis in yeast.1,2 The key molecule in the first system is glutathione, which contributes the majority to the redox balance at an intracellular concentration of millimolar range. The other is the thioredoxin system, which acts mainly at the level of gene expression, and in which electrons are transferred from NADPH to thioredoxin and then to oxidized protein targets. Thioredoxin, the key reductant, is micromolar in concentration, and a much stronger reducing agent than glutathione for a transcriptional factor such as Yap1 that switches on the expression of effectors in response to the oxidative stress.3,4 There are three isoforms of thioredoxin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Trx1 and Trx2 are localized in the cytosol, vacuole, and nuclei, and Trx3 in the mitochondria (http:// db.yeastgenome.org/). Trx2 participates in the regulation of cell redox homeostasis, the response to oxidative stress, and in both directions of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.5­8 In addition, Trx2 has been implicated in DNA replication, sulfate assimilation, vacuole fusion, and inheritance.5,9 The TRX2 gene is under the control of transcriptional factors Yap1 and Yap7. In response to the oxidative stress, Yap1 is oxidized, and accumulates in the nucleus and triggers the expression of a set of genes including TRX2.5 The highly

expressed Trx2 translocates in part to the nucleus to reduce Yap1, which is consequently exported to the cytoplasm via Crm1.3,10 The negative feedback regulation of Yap1 by Trx2 provides fine tuning to the stress response, and gives this isoform a major role in the response. ° We present here a 2.38 A crystal structure of thioredoxin Trx2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is the first structure for one of the yeast isoforms, which shows an original mode of dimerization and fills the gap in the thioredoxin structure dictionary between prokaryotes and higher organisms. Materials and Methods. Cloning, overexpression, and purification of Trx2. TRX2/YGR209C open reading frame was amplified by PCR and cloned into a pET28a-derived expression vector with the coding sequence of a hexahistidine (63His) tag just after the start codon. The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The transformant cells were grown in 23YT medium (5 g of NaCl, 16 g of bactotryptone, and 10 g of yeast extract) at 378C up to an A600 nm of 0.7. The protein expression was induced by adding 0.8 mM IPTG, and the cells were grown at 378C for 4 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, and 14 mM b-mercaptoethanol). After three cycles of freeze-thawing, 30 s of sonication,

and centrifugation, the supernatant containing the soluble target protein was collected. The His-tagged proteins were purified using a Ni-NTA column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the standard protocols. Eluted protein was further purified by gel filtration using a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated against the buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, and 14 mM b-mercaptoethanol. The purity of the pooled fractions was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the integrity of the protein samples was checked by mass spectrometry. The protein sample was concentrated to 20 mg/mL in the buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, and 14 mM b-mercaptoethanol for further use. Crystallization and structure determination. The protein was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 168C. Two microliters of the protein solution (20 mg/mL in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 200 mM NaCl) were mixed with 2 lL of the reservoir solution containing 0.2M ammonium sulfate, 0.1M sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 30% (w/v) PEG MME 2000. The rhombic crystals grew to the maximal size of 125 3 100 3 50 lm3 in 1 week. A single crystal was transferred to the cryoprotectant buffer of the reservoir solution plus 20% glycerol and flash frozen with ° liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data at 2.38 A resolution were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku MM007 X-ray genera° tor (k ¼ 1.54179 A) with a MarResearch 345 image-plate detector at School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC, Hefei, PR China). The crystal belongs to tetragonal space group P41212 with a dimer in an asymmetric unit. The data were evaluated with Mosflm11 and scaled with SCALA,12 and statistics are reported in Table I. Molecular replacement was performed with Molrep13 of CCP4i using the human thioredoxin (entry 1ERV) as a search model. After refinement by Refmac,14 the model had an R factor of 20.5% and Rfree of 25.8%. It contains all residues except for the His-tag. PROCHECK15 finds 91.4% of the residues in the most favored region and the rest in allowed regions. The final coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in protein data bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) under the accession code of 2FA4. Results and Discussion. The overall structure. The general fold of Trx2 resembles thioredoxins from other sources,16­23 consisting of five mixed b-strands flanked by four helices [Fig. 1(A)]. The two active site cysteines Cys31 and Cys34, are located at the amino end of the helix a2 on the protein surface [Fig. 1(B)]. Although Trx2 only shares a 34% of sequence identity with Escherichia coli thioredoxin (PDB entry 2TRX),20 the root-meansquare distance (RMSD) between the same 100 Ca atoms ° superposed is 1.15 A, so both crystals show a very similar overall structure. The sequence of Trx2 is 50% identical to that of the human thioredoxin hTXN1 (PDB entry 1ERU)16 over 104 residues, and structure superimposi° tion yields an RMSD of 0.73 A for all 104 Ca atoms. The only differences are in the loop between helix a1 and sheet b2, where Asp19 of the human thioredoxin is

deleted in yeast, and at the C-terminus, which is involved in dimer formation in Trx2, but not in hTXN1.16 The active site. The electron density at the active site of Trx2 clearly indicates that Cys31 and Cys34 are oxidized and form a disulfide bond. In other thioredoxin structures, the active site cysteines can be either oxidized or reduced, and conformational changes reported between the two forms are limited to main-chain shifts in the fragment Ala28-Cys34. The presence of a disulfide bond in Trx2 is unexpected, given that b-mercaptoethanol (14 mM) was present through out purification and crystallization, and that the oxidation of cysteine residues by the X-ray beam during data collection has been reported.24 The active site is similar to that of E. coli and human oxidized thioredoxins. Cys31 is exposed at the surface, Cys34 at a more buried position. Surrounding residues such as Asp25, Trp30, Lys35, Ala28, and Lys56, are highly conserved, and their interaction with the active cysteine pair accounts for the low pKa of Cys31 and the high pKa of Cys35. Compared to the human hTXN1 protein, Phe27 of Trx2 replaces a serine, and its aromatic ring protects Cys34 from the solvent. A phenylalanine is found at the same position in the thioredoxin of the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus.21 Relative to human thioredoxin, Trp30 shows a main ° chain shift of about 1.5 A away and a 908 rotation of the indole ring that forces the Met73 side chain to change conformation [Fig. 1(B)]. In other thioredoxin structures, the indole ring is oriented as in hTXN1. Trp30 is part of the WCGPC thioredoxin motif and of the interface with redox partners. It also contributes to dimer formation in the crystal structures of oxidized human and E. coli thioredoxins, where the indole nitrogen donates a hydrogen bond to Asp60 from the same subunit. In Trx2, Trp30 is also at the dimer interface, but it does not form a hydroDOI 10.1002/prot

gen bond. This tryptophan has another conformation in the thioredoxins of Typanosoma brucei and spinach,19 and it may serve as an adaptor for optimizing the interfaces with the redox partners of thioredoxin and the other subunit in the dimer. Crystal packing and dimerization. Thoredoxins are thought to function as monomers in redox reactions, but they may also form dimers, with cellular functions that have been discussed.16­19,27,28 At the concentration of about 40 lM during gel filtration, the majority of Trx2 exist as monomers, and only about 2% exist as dimers. This indicates that the dimerization of Trx2 will happen in case its concentration reaches the millimolar level, a rarely attained concentration in the cell. To date, the way the monomers associate remain uncertain, but we may find clues in crystal structures. Two molecules of Trx2 are packed in an asymmetric unit, but as there is no twofold rotation axis between the monomers

[Fig. 1(C)], the pair should be considered as a pseudodimer. There the active site of one monomer is exposed to the solvent, the other covered by its neighbor. This packing is quite different from that of human hTXN1 (PDB entry 1ERU) which two monomers interact headto-head, resulting in the active sites buried at the interface. In hTXN1, a disulfide bond that involves an extra cysteine on a loop close to the active site holds the dimer together [Fig. 1(A)]. Conclusions. Thioredoxins are ubiquitous proteins that have many partners and play multiple roles in cellular redox processes. Although their sequence and tertiary structure are highly conserved from bacteria to yeast to human, their quaternary structure varies, offering the interesting possibility that in some dimerization is a way of protecting the active site cysteines when other partners of the protein are absent.
