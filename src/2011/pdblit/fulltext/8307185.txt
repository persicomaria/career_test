The dynamic properties of 111 backbone HN sites in uncomplexed human profilin, a protein of 139 residues, have been characterized by two-dimensional inverse-detected `H-"N NMR spectroscopy. Heteronuclear {`H}J5N nuclear Overhauser effects and "N longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates have been analyzed in terms of model-free spectral density functions and exchange contributions to transverse relaxation rates. Relatively high mobilities on the nanosecond timescale are observed for ASPICand Se?`, which form part of a loop connecting B-strands A and B, and for Th?`* through Alags, which are in a loop connecting/I-strands E and F. Significant exchange contributions, indicative of motions on the microsecond to millisecond timescale, have been obtained for 30 residues. These include Leu", Asp@'and Gly*' of a loop between B-strands D and E, Se? and Met8' ofa-strand E, Gly'*' of a loop connectinga-strand G and the C-terminal helix, and Gin"*, which is next to the C-terminal residue Tyr"`. Some of the regi ons showing high flexibility in profilin are known to be involved in poly-L-proline binding.

1. INTRODUCTION Profilin is a small cytoplasmic protein involved in the regulation of the phosphatidylinositol cycle, actin polymerization and, consequently, cytoskeletal rearrangement [l-4]. A ubiquitous protein, profilin occurs in a great variety of eukaryotic cells. Profilin interacts with a number of cellular components, including monomeric actin. In vitro, profilin has been demonstrated to bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP& [5,6]. These observations implicate profilin as a central component in the signal transduction pathway leading to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Profilin also binds poly-L-proline (PLP) [7-91. While the biological significance of this latter interaction is unknown, the high occurrence of oligoproline stretches in cellular proteins** [9] indicates that PLP-binding is related to some as yet undiscovered function(s). We have undertaken NMR studies of human profYin, a _ 15 kDa protein containing 139 residues. Sequential `H, i3C and `*N NMR assignments, the elements of secondary structure, and a medium resolution tertiary structure have been determined [lo]. Structural studies

**Over 200 protein sequences with contiguous stretches of six or more prolmes have been identified [9]. These include phosphatases (e.g. calcinuerin A type II), kinases (e.g. KYKl protein-tyrosine kinase-1), receptors (e.g. androgen receptor) and transcription regulators (e.g. FOS-B).

of profilins from other species are underway in several laboratories. X-ray crystallography is being applied to Acanthamoeba profilin-I [ll] and the bovine profilinl actin complex [12,13]. Torchia and co-workers have reported NMR assignments, secondary structure elements, and a medium resolution tertiary structure for Acanthamoeba profilin-I [14,15]. Overall, the tertiary structures of human proBlin [lo] and Acanthamoeba profilin-I [ 151are quite similar. Human protiin contains a seven-stranded antiparallel p-sheet, with the strands designated A through G. In addition, a-helices are located in the N- and C-terminal regions, and between p-strands B and C. The N- and C-terminal helices lie in an antiparallel fashion on one side of the B-sheet. NMR studies revealed that PLP binds in a hydrophobic cleft formed by the interface of the terminal ends of the Nand C-terminal helices and B-strands A, B, F and G [9]. Consistent with these results are mutagenesis data [9,16] which implicate a cluster of hydrophobic residues in PLP-binding. In this paper, we report a study of the backbone dynamics of uncomplexed human profilin using twodimensional (2D) inverse detected `H-r*N NMR methods [17-191. `*N T1 and Tz relaxation times and steady state {`H}-`*N NOE values have been measured for 111 residues with adequately resolved `H-`*N correlations. These data are interpreted in terms of model-free spectral density functions [20-221 and exchange contributions to transverse relaxation rates. Several regions are found to have relatively high flexibilities on the ps-ns

or ps-ms timescales; these include exposed loops that are sensitive to PLP binding [9].

2. EXPERIMENTAL
A uniformly "N-labeled NMR sample of human protilin was prepared as described elsewhere [9, lo]. The sample used for the relaxation measurements was concentrated to 2.0 mM in a final volume of 0.6 ml, purged and sealed under argon. The buffer (pH 6.4) contained 10% *H,O, 10 mM phosphate, 25 mM KCI, 20 mM /?-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM EDTA. iH-15N NMR experiments were recorded at 20°C using a Varian UNITY-600 spectrometer. The spectra were acquired with the carrier frequencies set to 4.85 ppm (`H) and 119.5 ppm (15N), and with spectral widths of 8,000 Hz (`H) and 1,600 Hz (15N). The pulse sequence used for measurement of the steady-state {`H}-"N NOES is given in [18], and those used for determining 15N T, and T, relaxation times are described in [19]. All spectra were recorded as 128 t, increments with 1,024 complex points in t,. For the "N T, and T2 experiments, 32 transients were recorded per ti increment, and a recycle delay of 3.0 s was used. The NOE data (with and without `H saturation) were collected with 64 transients per t, increment using a recycle delay of 4.0 s. Longitudinal relaxation delays of48,160,321,481,641,882 and 1,123 ms were used for the T, experiments, and transverse relaxation delays of 7.8, 23.4, 39.0, 54.6, 70.2, 93.6 and 124.7 ms were used for the T, experiments. The 48 ms T, experiment was repeated twice (at the beginning and end of the data acquisition run) to assist in the determination of errors in the measured peak heights, and to verify sample stability. For all spectra, the time-domain data were processed to yield 1,024 real (F,) by 1,024 real (F2) point frequency-domain data matrices, with the upfield half of the `H acquisition dimension discarded. Additional details on NMR data acquisition and processing are as described in a previously reported i5N relaxation study of an isolated antibody V, domain [23]. The crosspeak heights derived from the T, and T, experiments were fit to exponential decays using methods described previously [23]. Errors in the peak heights for each residue were set equal to the root-mean-square baseline noise plus a percentage of the peak height at the shortest relaxation delay. Errors in derived T, and T, values were determined from 300 simulated peak height data sets derived from Gaussian random distributions about the experimental peak heights. The NOE values were derived from the ratios of crosspeak heights from experiments recorded with and without `H saturation (NOE = I,,&,,). Due to potential systematic errors [23], the NOES are considered accurate to only + 0.10 NOE units. Dipolar and chemical shift anisotropy contributions to the "N longitudinal relaxation rates (R, = l/T,), transverse relaxation rates (R2 = l/T,) and the {`H}-15N NOES were considered, using the usual expressions [18,22-241 and previously defined values for physical constants [23]. An additional term (R,,) was in some instances added to the expression for R,. Three different model-free spectral density functions, J(w) [20-221, were used to numerically fit [23,25] the relaxation data: J(w) = sr, /( 1 + f&,2) J(w) = szr, /(l + &,z) J(w) = sfzs;rJ(l + (1 - S)r/(l + w2rZ) (I) (2) (3)

nal correlation time resulting from the slower internal motions characterized by a slow correlation timer, (l/r,' = l/r, + l/r& In the following, ri and r, are both referred to as the effective internal correlation time r,. The criteria used for deciding which spectral density function to use for each fit, and whether or not to include R,,, have been described elsewhere [23]. Errors in the fitted parameters were determined by generating 200 Gaussian random distributions of the primary relaxation data for each residue and repeating the fits.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Excluding the N-terminus, there are 134 backbone HN sites in human profilin. Of these, 93 are well resolved, displaying crosspeaks with either no overlap or only minor overlap with other crosspeaks in the 2D `H-15N correlation spectra. Another 18 residues yield moderately overlapped crosspeaks for which peak height measurements were still feasible. Severe crosspeak overlap is observed for 23 residues, precluding characterization of these sites. Fits of the T, values, using all 7 time points, were obtained for all 111 characterized residues. The T, data generally fit exponential decays very well. Excluding Gly12', which yields very weak `H-"N crosspeaks due to an exchange-broadening process (see below), all residues have maximum errors between the experimental and best-fit peak intensities that are < 4% of the corresponding derived equilibrium magnetization. The majority of residues have maximum T, data intensity errors that are c 1%. The average T, value is 840 2 37 ms, and the maximum and minimum values are 1,020 f 43 ms (Glyg3) and 755 ? 28 ms (Ser56), respectively. Fits of the T2 values, using all 7 time points, were obtained for 107 of the 111 residues. Four residues Asp*`, Gly'l, Ser84 and Gly121 - show both rapid T2 relaxation and weak crosspeaks; therefore, the T, fits for these residues had to be performed using only the first few time points, resulting in somewhat less accurate parameter determinations. All 107 residues fit with 7 time points have maximum errors < 6%, and the majority have maximum errors < 2%. The average, maximum and minimum T, values are, respectively, 70 + 13 ms, 137 + 10 ms (Thrg2) and 29 f 10 ms (Asp'?. Including only the 93 residues with well resolved crosspeaks yields an average T2 value of 72 & 13 ms. The average NOE value for the 93 well resolved residues is 0.82 f 0.10, with a number of residues exceeding the theoretical maximum of 0.83. As discussed elsewhere [23], this is likely due to partial `HN saturation caused by magnetization transfer from presaturated `H,O and nearby saturated Ha resonances during the experiment recorded without broadband `H saturation. The minimum observed backbone {`H}-"N NOE is 0.24 for Se?`. Plots of the primary relaxation data (T,, T, and NOE values) vs. the sequential residue numbers are shown in Fig. 1. A table containing the primary relaxation data and their associated errors is available as supplementary material.

An overall r, of 10.6 + 0.2 ns has been determined from the TJT, ratios of 61 residues with well resolved crosspeaks which display an NOE 2 0.80 and T2 > 66 ms. These criteria indicate residues for which both significant ps-ns timescale motions and significant pus-ms timescale motions are unlikely. The same average r, is obtained using residues with a T,/T2 ratio within one standard deviation of the mean TI/T2 ratio for the 93 well resolved residues. The overall rotational motion of prohlin is expected to be highly isotropic, since the principal components of the inertial tensor, derived using the coordinates of the best NMR structure from the current ensemble [lo], are 1.18:1.05:1 .OO.The overall r, of protilin (10.6 ns at 20°C) is larger than those observed for the m 17 kDa protein staphylococcal nuclease (9.1 ns at 35'C) [18] and for the N 18 kDa protein interleukin-lj? (8.3 ns at 36'C) [22]. This difference is probably due to the significantly lower temperature used in the present study; however, minor aggregation of profilin can not be ruled out completely. The derived r, was treated as a fixed parameter for the subsequent data analysis. Using the previously described criteria for selecting the model-free parameters to include in fitting the primary relaxation data to spectral densities [23], adequate fits were obtained for 106 residues. For these cases, the resulting model-free parameters reproduced T, and T, values within 3% of the experimental values, and NOES within 0.10 of the experimental values. For residues 80, 8 1 and 121, less

reliable fits were obtained due to the above mentioned exchange-broadening effects. Va15' and Ser56, which were originally fit with Eqn. (l), required Eqn. (3) for adequate fits. A table listing the functional form of the spectral density used for each residue, the derived model-free parameters, and their associated errors, is available as supplementary material. In cases where Eqn. (2) or Eqn. (3) was used for the fit, z, is often ill-defined due to the relatively small contributions made by the second terms of Eqn. (2) and Eqn. (3). Thus, in many instances, it was only possible to establish an upper limit on r,. Also, for residues with Rzex included in the fit, derived Rkx values that are I 1.0 s-l must be regarded as insignificant, since in these cases the errors do not preclude R,, = 0.0 s-l. Most of the characterized HN sites in human profilin yield evidence of highly ordered conformations on both the ps-ns and pus-ms timescales. The average S2 is 0.90 f 0.09, and 81 residues do not display any significant (> 1.0 s-l) exchange contributions to Rz. The S* values, which are related to the angular restrictions of ps-ns timescales motions, are shown mapped on to a ribbon diagram of the human profilin solution structure [lo] in Fig. 2a. Regions showing uniformly high S* values include the N-terminal a-helix through /?-strand A (residues 4-22); most residues within the second a-helix (residues 651) and the surrounding irregular loops (residues 3643, 52-57); B-strand C through B-strand E (residues 63-90); p-strand F through B-strand G (residues 99-l 18); and most of the C-terminal a-helix (residues 123-137). Residues showing significantly reduced S* values (S* 5 <S*> -0.09) include ASHES = 0.65), (S* Se$7 (S* = 0.49) and Ses9 (S* = 0.81), which are within an irregular loop connecting B-strands A and B. Also displaying reduced S* values are VaP" (S* = 0.81) and AsrP (S* = 0.80) of a loop preceeding p-strand C; Thr9* (S* = 0.43), Gly93 (S* = 0.73), GlyW (S* = 0.71) and Ala9' (S* = 0.77) of a loop between B-strands E and F; and Leu'" (S* = 0.74) at the beginning of the C-terminal a-helix. All of the residues displaying enhanced mobilities on the ps-ns timescale are in relatively exposed regions of the structure (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows the measured R,, values mapped on to profilin's backbone fold. Significant R,, values (> 1.Os-l), which are indicative ofps-ms timescale transitions among "N nuclear environments that produce different "N chemical shifts, have been obtained for 30 residues. Included among the residues displaying significant R,, values are Ala3* (RZx = 4.0 s-l) of p-strand B; Asp75 (RkX = 2.5 s-l), Leu7' (R, = 2.9 s-l), Asp*' (R2ex> 9.0 SK')and GlyE1 (R2_> 9.0 s-l) of a loop between p-strands D and E; and Ser84 (R2ex= 9.1 s-`) and Met85 (R, = 4.8 s-l) of B-strand E. Large exchange contributions (RZex> 6.0 s-l) are also observed for Gly'*' of a loop proceeding the C-terminal helix, and Gln13' near the C-terminus. As with the faster motions, residues showing enhanced mobilities on the ps-ms 459

timescale generally correspond to the more exposed regions of the structure (Fig. 2B). It is informative to compare the result of this study to reported chemical shift changes induced by PLP binding [9]. Among the regions sensitive to PLP binding is the irregular loop between /?-strands A and B which,

as noted above, is highly dynamic on the ns timescale. Ala3', Gln'38 and the irregular loop between B-strands D and E, which display evidence of significant pus-ms timescale motions, are also perturbed by PLP binding. The high mobilities observed for some of the residues involved in PLP binding [9] indicate that induced or

selected fit of the backbone conformation may play a role in PLP/profilin interactions. Residues within the stretch Ile123-Ser'37(profilin's Cterminal helix) have been implicated in actin binding [26,27]. The evidence supporting this contention includes the results of chemical cross-linking studies [26], studies of peptides binding to actin [27], and the X-ray structure of gelsolin complexed with actin [28]. The involvement of pro&i's C-terminal helix in actin-binding has recently been confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure of the bovine profilin/actin complex [13]. We find that this region is relatively rigid on the examined timescales, with all residues displaying S2 values L 0.85 and no residues displaying R,, values > 1.7 s-l. These results suggest that significant changes in the backbone conformation of profilin's C-terminal helix upon actin binding may be unlikely. The X-ray analysis of the bovine profilin/actin complex [ 131 revealed additional residues within the loop preceeding the C-terminal helix that also interact with actin; these include the conserved, R, exchange-active residue Gly12'. The flexibility observed in this latter region may play a role in actin-binding. In conclusion, by allowing distinctions to be made between relatively ordered and relatively disordered regions, the characterization of protim's backbone dynamics is expected to assist efforts aimed at obtaining a high resolution solution structure of uncomplexed human protilin. In addition, these data will serve as a reference for elucidating dynamical changes induced by interactions, such as the binding of PLP and PIP,. REFERENCES
