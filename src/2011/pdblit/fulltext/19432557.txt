Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone) is a moderately potent and poorly selective inhibitor of protein kinase CK2, one of the most pleiotropic serine/threonine protein kinases, implicated in neoplasia and in other global diseases. By virtual screening of the MMS (Molecular Modeling Section) database, we have now identified quinalizarin (1,2,5,8tetrahydroxyanthraquinone) as an inhibitor of CK2 that is more potent and selective than emodin. CK2 inhibition by quinalizarin is competitive with respect to ATP, with a K i value of approx. 50 nM. Tested at 1 M concentration on a panel of 75 protein kinases, quinalizarin drastically inhibits only CK2, with a promiscuity score (11.1), which is the lowest ever reported so far for a CK2 inhibitor. Especially remarkable is the ability of quinalizarin to discriminate between CK2 and a number of kinases, notably DYRK1a (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase), PIM (provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia virus) 1, 2 and 3, HIPK2 (homeodomaininteracting protein kinase-2), MNK1 [MAPK (mitogen-activated

protein kinase)-interacting kinase 1], ERK8 (extracellular-signalregulated kinase 8) and PKD1 (protein kinase D 1), which conversely tend to be inhibited as drastically as CK2 by commercially available CK2 inhibitors. The determination of the crystal structure of a complex between quinalizarin and CK2 subunit highlights the relevance of polar interactions in stabilizing the binding, an unusual characteristic for a CK2 inhibitor, and disclose other structural features which may account for the narrow selectivity of this compound. Tested on Jurkat cells, quinalizarin proved able to inhibit endogenous CK2 and to induce apoptosis more efficiently than the commonly used CK2 inhibitors TBB (4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole) and DMAT (2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole). Key words: apoptosis, CK2 inhibitor, drug design, homeodomaininteracting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2), provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia virus 1 (PIM1), quinalizarin.

INTRODUCTION

CK2, an acronym derived from the old misnomer `casein kinase 2', denotes one of the most pleiotropic serine/threonine protein kinases with hundreds of substrates already known. Many of these substrates are implicated in fundamental cellular processes, such as gene expression, protein synthesis, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation/transformation (reviewed in [1­4]). The CK2 holoenzyme is composed of two catalytic subunits ( and/or  ) and a dimer of two non-catalytic subunits () that are very tightly assembled together [5]. In contrast with the majority of other protein kinases, the catalytic subunit of CK2 has never been found in an inactive conformation because of unique intramolecular constraints [6], a feature which is commonly referred to by saying that CK2 is `constitutively active'. Such a lack of evident downregulatory devices is likely to reflect the pleiotropy of this enzyme [7], but is also probably responsible for the pathogenic potential of this kinase, whose aberrantly high activity has been associated with numerous diseases [8].

Therefore, not surprisingly, considerable efforts have been made in recent times to develop specific cell-permeable CK2 inhibitors. Several ATP site-directed CK2 inhibitors have been described to date, belonging to different chemical classes [9­ 13]. Some of these are effective in vitro in the picomolar range [12], but no information is available about their selectivity for CK2. On the other hand, selectivity is expected to be high in the case of a recently developed non-competitive inhibitor [14] whose cell permeability, however, could not be demonstrated so far. Consequently, for the time being, the most widely used cell-permeable CK2 inhibitors, with K i values in the nanomolar range, are commercially available compounds belonging to the class of halogenated benzimidazoles/triazoles, notably TBB (4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole), TBI/TBBz (4,5,6,7tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole) and DMAT (2-dimethylamino4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole). Recently, however, the selectivity of these compounds for CK2 has been shown to be not as narrow as it was believed previously. The inclusion of additional members of the kinome into the panel of kinase used for

selectivity profiles revealed that some enzymes, notably DYRK (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase) 1a, DYRK3, PIM (provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia virus) 1, 2 and 3, HIPK (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase) 2, ERK8 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 8) and PKD (protein kinase D), tend to be inhibited as drastically as CK2 by one or another of these inhibitors [15]. This study also showed that, within a library of more than 50 TBB- and DMATderived compounds, the efficacy towards CK2 was paralleled by similar ability to also inhibit PIM1 and/or HIPK2. This prompted us to adopt a different strategy for the identification of specific CK2 inhibitors, consisting of computeraided virtual screening of the MMS (Molecular Modeling Section) database based on the crystal structure of the human CK2 subunit (PDB code 1JWH). This scrutiny ended up with the identification of quinalizarin (1,2,5,8-tetrahydroxyanthraquinone) as a potential CK2 inhibitor. Quinalizarin belongs to the same chemical class of compounds also comprising emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy6-methylanthraquinone) described previously as a rather promiscuous inhibitor of several protein kinases, including CK2 [16­19]. In the present study, we show that the selectivity of quinalizarin toward CK2 is indeed superior to that of any other CK2 inhibitor tested so far, and we analyse the structural features and the functional consequences of quinalizarin binding to CK2.
EXPERIMENTAL Inhibitors

2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EGTA, 30 M synthetic peptide substrate RKRRQTSMTD and 100 M [ -33 P]ATP. HIPK2 activity was determined under the same conditions used for PIM1 assays except for ATP which was 20 M and the use of 10 g of MBP (myelin basic protein) as a phosphorylatable substrate. Conditions for the activity assays of all other protein kinases tested in selectivity experiments are as described or referenced in [23].
Kinetic determination

Initial velocities were determined at each of the substrate concentration tested. K m values were calculated either in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitor, from Lineweaver­Burk double-reciprocal plots of the data. Inhibition constants were then calculated by linear regression analysis of K m /V max against inhibitor concentration plots. Alternatively inhibition constants were also deduced from the IC50 /K i Cheng­Prusoff relationship [24]. The rationale underlying this approach, on the basis of the assumption that inhibition is competitive with respect to ATP, is illustrated by Burlingham and Widlanski [25].
Cell culture, transfection and treatment

Quinalizarin (> 99 % analytically pure) was provided by Produits Chimiques ACP Chemicals. The atomic structure was confirmed further by solving its complex with CK2 (co-ordinates for which have been deposited in the RCSB PDB under code 3FL5). Identical biochemical and structural data were obtained with another stock of quinalizarin purchased previously from EGAChemie. Emodin was purchased from Sigma­Aldrich. TBCA (4,5,6,7-tetrabromocinnamic acid) was synthesized as described previously [20]. TBB and benzimidazole derivatives were kindly provided by Professor Z. Kazimierczuk (Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University, Warsaw, Poland).
Source and purification of protein kinases

Native CK2 was purified from rat liver [21]. Human recombinant  and  subunits of CK2 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the holoenzyme was reconstituted and purified as described previously [22]. Single and double mutants of CK2 subunit were generated as reported in [9,19]. The source of all of the other protein kinases used for specificity assays is as described previously or referenced in [23].
Phosphorylation assays

The human leukaemia Jurkat T-cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, and HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Each medium was supplemented with 10 % (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. For transfection, HEK-293T cells were plated on to 60-mm-diameter dishes at  80 % confluence and transiently transfected with 4 g of Akt cDNA using a standard calcium phosphate procedure, as described in [26]. For the treatment, cells were cultured in a medium containing 1 % (v/v) fetal calf serum, then incubated at 37 C, in the presence of the compounds at the indicated concentrations. Control cells were treated with equal amounts of solvent (0.5 % DMSO). For the determination of CK2 activity, at the end of incubations, cells were lysed by the addition of hypo-osmotic buffer, and 1­2 g of cell protein was incubated with the CK2-specific peptide in the presence of a phosphorylation mixture, as described previously [27]. Alternatively, 10 g of cell protein was analysed by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies towards the CK2dependent site (Akt Ser129 ) [26]. Cell viability was assessed by means of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium bromide] reagent, whereas apoptosis/necrosis were evaluated by means of the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche), on the basis of the quantification of nucleosomes present in the cytosol of the apoptotic cells or released from necrotic cells, following the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 10 000 cells was used for each determination.
Crystal preparation and data collection

CK2 activity was tested in a final volume of 25 l containing 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl2 , 100 M synthetic peptide substrate RRRADDSDDDDD and 0.02 mM [ -33 P]ATP (500­1000 c.p.m./pmol), unless indicated otherwise, and incubated for 10 min at 37 C. Native CK2 purified from rat liver (0.5­1 pmol) was usually the phosphorylating enzyme, unless indicated otherwise. Assays were stopped by addition of 5 l of 0.5 M orthophosphoric acid before spotting 20 l aliquots on to phosphocellulose filters. Filters were washed in 75 mM phosphoric acid (5­10 ml each) four times then once in methanol and dried before counting. PIM1 activity was determined by following the same procedure by incubating the kinase in the presence of 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 % (v/v)

The recombinant CK2 -subunit from Zea mays was expressed in E. coli, isolated and purified according to a method described previously [28]. Crystals of the CK2 complex with the inhibitor quinalizarin were obtained by co-crystallization with the sittingdrop vapour-diffusion technique. An 8 mg/ml protein stock (in 25 mM Tris/HCl, 500 mM NaCl and 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5) was mixed with 2 vol. of a solution containing a 6-fold molar excess of inhibitor in approx. 2 % DMSO. The mixture was incubated in ice for 2 h before setting up the crystallization drops. Crystallization was performed by mixing 3 l of the proteininhibitor solution with 1 l of precipitant solution {20 % PEG

For the computer-aided virtual screening and molecular docking stages, human CK2 subunit and PIM1 catalytic subunit were retrieved from the PDB (PDB codes 1JWH and 3BGZ respectively). These crystal structures have shown to be the best choice to reproduce the correct pose of known crystallized inhibitors, during the protocol calibration phase (results not shown). Both structures were considered with a constitutive water molecule [36], whereas all the other ligands and cofactors were removed; in the case of 1JWH, the CK2 conserved water molecule was added to the crystal structure. Hydrogen atoms were added to the protein structure using standard geometries with the MOE program [Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2006.03), Chemical Computing Group]. To minimize contacts between hydrogens, the structures were subjected to Amber94 force field minimization until the root mean square deviation of conjugate gradient was < 0.1 kcal · mol-1 · Å-1 (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ; 1 Å = 0.1 nm), keeping the heavy atoms fixed at their crystallographic positions. To strictly validate the model generated and to calibrate the high-throughput docking protocol, a small database of known PIM1 and CK2 inhibitors was built and a set of docking runs were performed using four different algorithms (MOE-Dock, Glide, FlexX and Gold) and five different scoring functions (Moe-score, Glide-score, Gold-score, Chem-score and X-score). After the calibration phase, a computeraided virtual screening using the MMS database (more than 3000 of both synthetic and natural compounds) and a semi-flexible ligand-docking step were performed essentially as described previously [37,38]. A detailed description of the molecular docking protocol together with analytical data is shown in the Supplementary Online Data at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/421/bj4210387add.htm.

[poly(ethylene glycol)] 4000, 200 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM sodium Hepes, pH 7.5} and equilibrated against a 500 l reservoir containing the same precipitant. Trays were allowed to stand at 293 K, and crystals grew in 2 days. X-ray diffraction data were collected at ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) beamline ID14 in Grenoble, at a temperature of 100 K. Crystals were cryoprotected by immersion oil type B (Hampton Research). Data were indexed with MOSFLM v.6.2.6 [29] and then scaled with SCALA [30] from the CCP4 software package [31].
Structure determination and refinement

The CK2­quinalizarin complex crystallizes in space group C2, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. To find the best position inside the unit cell, an initial rigid-body transformation on the model of the apo-enzyme was adequate, using the rigidbody refinement option of REFMAC 5 (CCP4 suite) [32]. Data collection and final model statistics are reported in Table 1. The presence of the inhibitors in the active site was clear since the beginning of the refinement in both F o -F c and 2F o -F c maps. The definition files for the inhibitor were created using the monomer library sketcher routine of CCP4. Refinement was carried out alternating automated cycles and manual inspection steps using the graphic program Coot v.0.5 [33]. The stereochemistry and geometric properties of the final model were checked using Coot validate analysis and Sfcheck [34] and Procheck [35] in the CCP4 suite and were adequate for the resolution.

Emodin, the active principal of herbal medicine extracted from Rheum palmatum, originally reported in the literature as a fairly specific inhibitor of some tyrosine kinases [16,17], was later found to inhibit the serine/threonine kinase CK2 even more effectively [18]. In contrast, several other non-substituted hydroxyanthraquinones differing from emodin in the number and position of hydroxy groups, notably chrysophanic acid, aloe-emodin and 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, display negligible inhibitory efficacy towards CK2 [39] (Figure 1A). However, in a computer-aided virtual screening of the MMS database, based on the crystal structure of human CK2 (PDB code 1JWH), quinalizarin (Figure 1A) has been found to sit in the top 10 % of the ranked database independently of the nature of the scoring function used. This prompted us to assay quinalizarin as a CK2 inhibitor, by performing the kinetic experiments illustrated in Figure 1(B). The results show that quinalizarin is indeed a powerful inhibitor of CK2, competitive with respect to ATP: its K i value (approx. 60 nM) is lower than those of emodin and TBB [40] and comparable with that of TBCA [20]. Next, we wanted to assess the selectivity of quinalizarin by testing its inhibitory potency on a panel of 75 protein kinases. The selectivity profile was run at a concentration of 1 M, sufficient to inhibit CK2 activity more than 90 %. As shown in Figure 2, under these conditions, the residual CK2 activity was approx. 7 %. In sharp contrast, none of the other kinases was inhibited as drastically as CK2, with the second most inhibited kinase (PIM3) still exhibiting more than 50 % residual activity, followed by DYRK1A, DYRK3 and PIM1, whose residual activity was 60 %

or more. The K i values for the inhibition of these kinases by quinalizarin were calculated (Table 2) and found to be one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of CK2, a difference sufficient to ensure a clear-cut discrimination of CK2 among other kinases susceptible to quinalizarin inhibition. In contrast, some of these kinases, notably PIM1 and PIM3, were inhibited by emodin as well as by the commercially available CK2 inhibitors TBB, DMAT and TBI/TBBz more drastically than by quinalizarin. The remarkable selectivity of quinalizarin prompted us to compare it with that of TBCA, another CK2 inhibitor whose efficacy is sufficiently high to profile its selectivity at a concentration of 1 instead of 10 M. TBCA was tested previously at a concentration of 10 M on a panel of 28 protein kinases, disclosing its ability to discriminate between CK2 and DYRK1a [20], a kinase often affected by CK2 inhibitors. That panel, however, did not include a number of kinases shown later to be inhibited by TBB, DMAT and other CK2 inhibitors as drastically as CK2 itself [15]. The new data with TBCA (1 M) on a panel of
c The Authors Journal compilation c 2009 Biochemical Society

72 protein kinases are shown in Figure 2 (lower panel), where they are compared with those obtained with 1 M quinalizarin (upper panel). They confirm that kinases of the DYRK family are much less susceptible to TBCA (as well as to quinalizarin) than is CK2. However, they also show that kinases of the PIM family tend to be inhibited more drastically by TBCA than they are by quinalizarin and that two other kinases either unaffected or poorly affected by quinalizarin, MNK1 [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)interacting kinase 1] and ERK8, are inhibited 75 % or more by 1 M TBCA. Higher selectivity towards CK2 of quinalizarin compared with TBCA is also reflected in a lower promiscuity score, expressing the average inhibition of the protein kinases of the panel by an inhibitor concentration sufficient to suppress CK2 activity (residual activity < 10 %) [15]. As calculated in Figure 2, the promiscuity score of quinalizarin (11.13) is below that of TBCA (15.7). It is also much lower than those calculated for the typical CK2 inhibitors TBB, TBI/TBBz and DMAT (see [15]). In summary, it appears that quinalizarin is the most selective CK2 inhibitor analysed, with a potency, in terms of a K i value, comparable with those of the most powerful of these inhibitors, notably TBCA, DMAT, DBC and NBC [10,20]. Somewhat surprisingly, the two unique CK2 hydrophobic residues shown to play a prominent role in the interaction with the majority of CK2 inhibitors, Val66 and Ile174 , appear to be only of marginal relevance in the case of quinalizarin, whose IC50 value is poorly affected by their mutation to alanine. In contrast, these mutations, and especially the double mutant, cause a more than 50-fold increase in the IC50 for emodin (Figure 3). To get a better insight into the mode of binding of quinalizarin and to try to disclose the structural basis for its selectivity, the three-dimensional structure of a complex between quinalizarin and CK2 (from Z. mays) has been solved. As shown in Figure 4(A), quinalizarin makes polar interactions with CK2 using at least three of its hydroxy groups: the one at position 2 is hydrogen-bonded with the conserved water molecule(1) and Lys68 (which is also near to quinalizarin hydroxy group 2, 3.3 Å from it), the one at position 5 interacts with the hinge region (carbonyl backbone of Val116 ) through another water molecule, whereas hydroxy group 8 makes a very stable polar interaction with His160 and the backbone carbonyl group of Arg47 . This latter interaction occurs through hydrogen bonds among the three atoms at almost the same distance, giving rise to a sort of equilateral triangle and stabilizing the kinase into a close conformation which entraps the inhibitor inside the pocket (Figure 5). Note in this respect that, although the scaffold of quinalizarin in this structure is coplanar and superimposable on that of emodin in its complex with human CK2 (PDB code 3BQC, see Figure 4B) [41] the lack of a hydroxy group at position 5 in emodin prevents the formation of

Figure 3 CK2 inhibition by quinalizarin is marginally affected by Val66 and Ile174 substitutions
IC50 values were calculated by determining the activity of CK2, either wild-type or mutant, at 20 M ATP with increasing concentration of inhibitors, The ratio between the IC50 value of each mutant and the IC50 value of wild-type CK2 was then calculated.

the interaction with His160 and the backbone of Arg47 found with quinalizarin. Since crystallographic data are not yet available for PIM1 kinase in complex with quinalizarin or emodin, a molecular docking of these inhibitors with PIM1 was performed (Figure 6).

This discloses structural features accounting, on the one hand, for the higher susceptibility of this kinase to emodin, and on the other, for its reduced sensitivity to quinalizarin. Although both inhibitors can be accommodated in the binding cleft of PIM1 in a position similar to that observed in the two crystal structures of CK2 discussed above (PDB codes 3BQC and 3FL5 for emodin and quinalizarin respectively), they have to face at least three important amino acid substitutions. First, the replacement in PIM1 of the CK2 water-exposed Tyr50 with Phe49 (PIM3 carries the same substitution), which is oriented inside the cleft, puts both inhibitors in contact with this hydrophobic side chain; whereas emodin can take advantage of this apolar interaction owing to its more hydrophobic characteristics, Phe49 will negatively affect quinalizarin binding, mainly for an unfavourable interaction with the hydroxy group at position 8, at only 3.6 Å from the phenylalanine aromatic side chain. Note that in the corresponding position (5), emodin does not carry any functional group. Secondly, PIM1 replaces CK2 Met163 with Leu174 . Also in this case, the docking mechanism suggests an unfavourable interaction between the hydroxy group at position 5 and Leu174 , at only 3.5 Å. In this situation, the hydroxy group at position 5 cannot make an interaction with a water molecule as in the case of CK2. On the other hand, emodin is attracted towards Leu174 , preserving the interaction between the hydroxy group at position 3 and the conserved water molecule, but making a rotation of approx. 30 with respect to the quinalizarin position. This places emodin in a

carbonyl group of Glu121 , at 2.7 Å distance. Finally, owing to the substitution of Glu171 for His160 , PIM1 is not able to make the same interaction of quinalizarin's hydroxy group at position 8 observable in the crystal structure of its complex with CK2. It is interesting to note that only 21 % of the protein kinases included in the selectivity panel have a tyrosine residue at the position homologous with CK2 Tyr50 and only 10 % have a methionine residue homologous with CK2 Met163 . Almost all the kinases belonging to this latter group have a phenylalanine residue instead of Tyr50 . Moreover, within the selectivity panel, CK2 is

the only kinase bearing the His160 residue. It can be concluded therefore that CK2 possesses a particular combination of residues that could explain the remarkable selectivity of quinalizarin. In order to see whether quinalizarin is cell-permeable, advantage has been taken of two cell lines: HEK-293T cells, which can be easily transfected with Akt whose phosphorylation by CK2 at Ser129 can be specifically monitored by anti-pSer129 antibodies [26], and Jurkat cells, which have been commonly used in the past to measure the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic efficacy of many CK2 inhibitors. Treatment of HEK-293T cells with 5 M quinalizarin (Figure 7A) is sufficient to reduce Akt Ser129 phosphorylation by > 60 %, i.e. more efficiently than treatment with 25 M TBB. Similar results were obtained with Jurkat cells whose 4 h treatment with 5 M quinalizarin is sufficient to induce a 48 + 5 % fall in CK2 activity in the cell - lysates, whereas the efficacy of TBB is hardly detectable at this concentration (11 + 6 % inhibition). Consistent with this, - quinalizarin is also more effective than TBB in inducing cell death (Figure 7B). Interestingly, cell death induced by quinalizarin is mainly accounted for by apoptosis with just a minor contribution from necrosis (Figure 7C). Necrosis is instead more accentuated in the case of TBB and, even more, in that of DMAT, where it predominates over apoptosis. Since we know that several other kinases (especially those of the DYRK, HIPK and PIM families) are drastically inhibited by DMAT, and to a lesser extent by TBB [15], it is tempting to ascribe the necrosis observed with these CK2 inhibitors to the targeting of protein kinases other than CK2.
DISCUSSION

For the time being and to the best of our knowledge, quinalizarin is the most selective CK2 inhibitor with a K i in the low-nanomolar

range whose specificity has been profiled on large panels of protein kinases (70 or more). This is reflected in a particularly low `promiscuity score', expressing the average inhibition of all the kinases of the panel, measured at a concentration of the inhibitor sufficient to inhibit activity drastically (> 90 %), but not to fully suppress the activity of the kinase of interest [15]. This value in the case of quinalizarin falls to 11.1, below that of TBCA (15.7) (Figure 2), not to mention TBB (47.3), TBI/TBBz (53), DMAT (49.31) and even the improved DMAT derivative K66 (19.3) [15]. Especially noteworthy is the observation that, by testing quinalizarin at a concentration of 1 M on a panel of 75 kinases, CK2 is inhibited by 93 %, with the second most inhibited kinase (PIM3) being still > 50 % active and displaying a IC50 value (1.73 M) > 15-fold higher than that of CK2 (0.11 M). These data are particularly striking if it is born in mind that quinalizarin is structurally very similar to emodin, a quite promiscuous inhibitor of CK2 and of several other protein kinases as well, whose potency toward PIM3 (IC50 = 0.08 M) is 30-fold higher than that towards CK2 (IC50 = 2.50 M) The determination of the crystal structure of a complex between quinalizarin and CK2, in conjunction with the availability of the structure of PIM1 (whose behaviour with emodin as opposed to quinalizarin is similar to that of PIM3), has disclosed a number of structural features that may account for the marked predilection of quinalizarin for CK2. Of crucial relevance appears to be the presence in quinalizarin of the hydroxy group at position 8, forming with those at positions 2 and 5 a triad of hydroxy groups which make possible three strong polar interactions within the active site of CK2. These take place with: (i) a water molecule present in all CK2 structures and with Lys68 nearby; (ii) the backbone of the hinge region, through a second water molecule; and (iii) with the backbone of Arg47 and with His160 (Figure 4A)

respectively. These interactions, moreover, force the kinase to adopt a closed conformation which favours the entrapping of the inhibitor (Figure 5). In emodin, the hydroxy groups at positions 1 and 8 are conserved, but the one at position 5 is not (Figure 1A) and the one at position 2 is shifted to position 3. As a consequence, emodin cannot make the same triad of hydrogen bonds observed with quinalizarin: as observed in the 3BQC structure, it can make two polar interactions (i and ii respectively) using hydroxy groups 3 and 8, but not the third one (iii) with Arg47 and His160 . An additional disadvantage of emodin is that the hydroxy group at position 1 and the methyl group have an unfavourable environment, therefore contributing in a negative way to the energetics of binding in comparison with quinalizarin. In the 3BQC structure, the hydroxy group at position 1 is situated in a substantially hydrophobic environment in the deeper part of the cavity, near Ile66 , Val95 , Phe113 and Val116 , while the methyl group in position 6 is exposed to the solvent. In another available emodin/CK2 complex (PDB code 1F0Q), emodin has an inverted orientation [42], but again with the methyl group in an unfavourable hydrophilic environment near Lys68 and Glu81 . This can explain, at least in part, the higher potency of quinalizarin, from where these adverse interactions are absent, compared with emodin. Although the scaffolds of emodin and quinalizarin are superimposed so that they make similar apolar contacts with a number of hydrophobic side chains, the mutation of two of these (Val66 and Ile174 ) to alanine causes a 55-fold decrease in inhibitory efficacy with emodin, while having an only marginal effect with quinalizarin (Figure 3). This is not straightforward to explain based solely on the crystal structure of the wild-type kinase; probably more general solvation/desolvation effects must be considered, taking into account the more hydrophobic character of emodin compared with quinalizarin as well as the possibility that the introduction of a mutation can also significantly alter the binding mode of the ligand. In the same vein, it should be noted that in PIM1 and in many other kinases: (i) Tyr50 which in CK2 is oriented outwards owing to its hydrophilic hydroxy group, is replaced by the more hydrophobic phenylalanine, which implies an orientation inside the cleft (as shown by modelling in Figure 6); (ii) Met163 is replaced by Leu174 ; and (iii) His160 is replaced by Glu171 . These three features favour the accommodation of emodin (with the phenylalanine side chain pointing towards the methyl group), while hindering that of quinalizarin, forced to face the hydrophobic side chain of phenylalanine and leucine with its hydrophilic hydroxy groups at positions 8 and 5. Interestingly, among all the kinases belonging to the selectivity panel, only CK2 can accomplish at the same time all the three quinalizarinbinding optimizing interactions. Similarly to emodin [40], TBB [27], DMAT [43] and several other CK2 inhibitors [10], quinalizarin is also cell-permeable, as judged from its ability to inhibit endogenous CK2 in HEK-293 and Jurkat cells. Such an inhibition, which is higher than that observed with TBB, correlates with a marked cytotoxic efficacy (Figure 7B). It should be noted, however, that, at variance with TBB and DMAT, whose cytotoxic effect is substantially (and, in the case of DMAT, predominantly) accounted for by necrosis, quinalizarin only marginally increases necrosis, with a much more remarkable enhancement of apoptosis (Figure 7C). Such behaviour, reminiscent of that of etoposide, a typical apoptosis inducer, in conjunction with the narrow selectivity of quinalizarin for CK2, corroborates the notion that inhibition of CK2 mainly results in apoptosis. This raises the possibility that the necrotic effect observed with other CK2 inhibitors is at least partially due to the inhibition of protein kinases other than CK2. It may be pertinent to note in this respect that DMAT, whose necrotic effect is

much more pronounced than its pro-apoptotic efficacy, is the least selective among the three inhibitors tested in Figure 7(B), with ERK8, PKD1, DYRK 1a, 2 and 3, PIM 1, 2, 3 and HIPK 2 and 3 inhibited as drastically or even more drastically than CK2 itself [15].

Human CK2 -subunit and PIM1 catalytic subunit were retrieved from the PDB (codes 1JWH and 3BGZ respectively) [1]. Both structures were considered with a constitutive water molecule, while all the other ligands and cofactors were removed; in the case of 1JWH, the CK2 conserved water molecule was added to the crystal structure. Hydrogen atoms were added using standard geometries to the protein structure with the MOE [Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2006.03), Chemical Computing Group] program. To minimize contacts between hydrogens, the structures were subjected to Amber94 force field minimization until the root mean square deviation of conjugate gradient was < 0.1 kcal · mol-1 · Å-1 keeping the heavy atoms fixed at their crystallographic positions. These crystal structures have been shown to be the best choice to reproduce the correct pose of known crystallized inhibitors, during the protocol calibration phase: a small database of known crystallized PIM1 and CK2 inhibitors was built and a set of docking runs were performed. The results of the calibration phase are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 where the calculated RMSD are reported. The root mean square deviation is a frequently used measure of the differences between values predicted by a docking procedure and the values actually observed from crystal structures, and is a good measure of the protocol accuracy. All atoms' root mean square deviations are calculated superimposing the docking and the crystallographic poses of known crystallized inhibitors.

Optimized high-throughput docking

After the high-throughput docking protocol calibration phase, we performed a flexible ligand-docking step with four different programs, MOE-Dock, Glide [2], Gold (Schr¨ dinger) and FlexX o [3], all relatively fast in their implementations and following different protein­ligand docking/scoring approaches. Standard parameters of all four docking programs were used. The results from this parallel docking and scoring served as starting point for consensus selection strategy.
Consensus docking and scoring function selection

We performed consensus docking and scoring. Five scoring functions {MOE-Score, GlideScore [2], GoldScore (Schr¨ dinger), o

ChemScore [2] and Xscore [4]} have been used to appropriately rank all MMS database candidates. We established a cut-off value for the top 10 % compounds ranked by all possible combinations of flexible-docking/scoring functions, and prioritized the selection of the compounds that were common to these two lists, resulting in the generation of a consensus `docked/scored list'.

The co-ordinates for the model of CK2 in complex with quinalizarin have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under code 3FL5. 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email lorenzo.pinna@unipd.it).

We have implemented an in-house molecular database (defined as `MMS database') in which more than 3000 compounds are collected for specific virtual screening applications. Several classes of synthetic and natural compounds are represented in our molecular database; moreover, a panel of 21 known CK2 inhibitors are included inside the database to calibrate the high-throughput consensus docking protocols.
