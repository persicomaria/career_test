Introduction. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) mediate a variety of cell signals regulating cell growth, differentiation, transcription, and metabolism. MAPKs are fully activated by dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine in their activation loops. This process is thought to be counteracted by a family of proteins termed dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases (DSPs). Inadequate production or action of MAPKs or DSPs has been associated with diverse human disorders, including cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases.1­4 DSPs are a subclass of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily that shares a highly conserved active site motif and a common catalytic mechanism. The members of human DSP family, which dephosphorylate both phospho-serine/threonine and phosphotyrosine substrates, can be divided into dual-specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (DS-MKPs) and atypical DSPs. Atypical DSPs contain only catalytic domain, whereas DS-MKPs have an additional N-terminal MAPK binding domain that is responsible for the substrate recognition.5 Dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5) belongs to DS-MKP subfamily and preferentially dephosphorylates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in vitro.6 DUSP5 can be distinguished from other DSPs by its mRNA regulation, response to extracellular stimuli, and tissue-specific expression, suggesting that DUSP5 play a specific role in the cell. Recently, the transcription of the DUSP5 gene was shown to be directly regulated by p53, and the overexpression of DUSP5 was shown to suppress the growth of several types of human cancer cells.7 More potent and selective inhibitors are needed to elucidate the specific cellular function of individual DSPs and as candidates for clinical use.3 The development of such inhibitors has been hampered, at least in part, by a lack of structural information. Among the 11 members of DS-MKPs of the human genome, only PAC1 and MKP3 have been structurally characterized.8,9 These, however, have substantially different conformation than PTPs in active conformations,3 as deduced from their

structures with bound substrates or inhibitors. Here, we report the crystal structure of catalytic domain of ° human DUSP5 (DUSP5-C) at 2.7 A resolution. The detailed structure revealed that DUSP5-C adopts an active conformation of PTP. In addition, DUSP5-C forms dimers through a novel head-to-tail association. These structural features of DUSP5 indicate that DUSP5 has a different mechanism of substrate recognition than other DS-MKPs. This information should pave the way for the rational design of specific inhibitors. Materials and Methods. Expression and Purification. DUSP5 (accession code, NM004419) was cloned from human brain cDNA (Clontech) and subcloned into pET28a. DUSP5-C(C263S) (residues 178­321) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain. The C263S mutation was necessary to obtain well-diffracting crystals, possibly because the cysteine residue in the active site is susceptible to oxidation. Cells were induced for 24 h with 0.1 mM IPTG and then grown at 291 K. Cells were harvested and then sonicated in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 0.04% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Next, the His-tagged DUSP5-C protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography. The His-tag was then removed by digestion with thrombin, and the DUSP5-C protein was further purified by Q-Sepharose

tion. The structure was refined using CNS13 and iterative manual model building was performed using the O program.14 Because the three protomers in the asymmetric unit adopt essentially the same conformation, the non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were applied during the refinement and released during the final stage of refinement. Strong densities in the difference Fourier map were found near the active sites of the three protomers. We modeled these as sulfate ions, because ammonium sulfate was present in the precipitant solution used for crystallization. The final Rcryst and Rfree are 24.4% and 29.1%, respectively. A Ramachandran plot drawn using PROCHECK15 showed that 87.8% and 12.2% of all residues fell within the most favored and additionally favored regions, respectively. There were no residues in the additionally allowed or disallowed regions. The final model includes the residues 174­320 for protomer A, the residues 178­320 for protomer B, the residues 174­319 for protomer C, six sulfate ions, and 39 water molecules. For both protomers A and C, the preceding four residues from the N-terminus for thrombin cleavage site were included in the model. Figures were drawn using the programs RIBBONS,16 GRASP,17 Bobscript18 and Molscript.19 Results and Discussion. DUSP5-C has a compact structure comprising a central twisted five-stranded b sheet surrounded by six a helices with approximate ° dimensions of 40 3 30 3 30 A3 [Fig. 1(a)]. One side of bsheet is covered with two a-helices and the other is covered with four. A search for homologues structures using the Dali server20 identified several members of the PTP family, including Vaccinia virus VH1-related dual-specific protein phosphatase (VHR; pdb code, 1VHR; z-score ¼ 22.2),21 MAPK phosphatase 3 (MKP3; pdb code, 1MKP; z-score ¼ 20.0), Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (pdb code, 1FPZ; z-score ¼ 16.4),22 PTEN tumor suppressor (pdb code, 1D5R; z-score ¼ 16.8),23 and mRNA capping enzyme (pdb code, 1I9S; z-score ¼ 14.4).24 When we aligned the structure of DUSP5-C with that of VHR, 136 out of 146 Ca atoms were superim° posed with a root mean square deviation of 1.3 A [Fig. 1(a)]. The superpositions were performed using the O ° program14 using the criteria of being less than 3.8 A for more than three consecutive Ca atoms. The regions that could not be aligned were mainly found in the a0 helix and the following loop a0-b1, which are completely absent in DUSP5-C structure and loop b3-b4 (residue 213­222). Except for loop b3-b4, the DUSP5-C structure was nearly identical to that of VHR. The active site of DUSP5-C consists of the phosphate binding loop (P-loop, Cys263-X5-Arg269) and Asp232, which acts as a general acid [Fig. 1(b)]. The common active site conformation of all PTPs can be defined by the direction of side-chain of the active-site cysteine, the interaction of the P-loop with substrate, and the hydrogen-bonding interaction of general-acid aspartate.3 The side chain of C263S, which acts as a nucleophile, ideally positioned beneath the P-loop.

ion exchange chromatography. The purified protein was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mM HEPESNaOH (pH 7.5), 0.1M NaCl, 2mM DTT, and concentrated to 20 mg/mL for use in crystallization. Crystallization and data collection. Crystallization was performed at 188C using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Initial trials were carried out using commercial screening kits (Hampton Research). The best crystals were grown by mixing 1.8 lL of protein (20 mg/ mL) solution and equal volume of reservoir solution containing 0.1M Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 2.2M ammonium sulfate, and 6% (v/v) PEG400. After 3d, DUSP5-C crystals were grown to their full size. X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline 5A at Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) using an ADSC quantum 315 detector. The crystal in the droplet was transferred to a cryo solution containing the mother liquor supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol for 1 min and flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream ° at 93 K. The crystal was diffracted to 2.7 A resolution and belonged to the space group P4322 with unit cell pa° ° rameters of a ¼ b ¼ 92.71 A, c ¼ 165.21 A, a ¼ b ¼ g ¼ 908. The collected diffraction data were processed and scaled with Mosflm10 and Scala.11 The statistics for data collection and refinement are shown in Table I. Structure solution and refinement. The structure of DUSP5-C was determined by molecular replacement method using MKP3 structure (PDB code, 1MKP; 46% sequence identity to DUSP5-C) as a search model.9 The EPMR12 program placed three protomers in the asymmetric unit of crystal with combined correlation coefficients of 0.601 (R factor ¼ 0.608). A randomly selected sample (5%) of data was set aside for the Rfree calculaPROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

atoms of the P-loop are directed inside the P-loop and create a positive electrostatic potential. Like other sulfate ions near the P-loop found in other PTP crystal structures,21­23 the oxygen atoms from sulfate ion (Sulf1) form strong interactions with the backbone amides (Glu264­Ser268) and guanidine group in Arg269. Asp232 as a general acid occupies the equivalent position of Asp92 in VHR and has hydrogen bonding interaction with the side chain of Ser268. The side chain of Arg269 responsible for substrate binding is also situated in the proper position for the catalytic reaction. Structural superposition between DUSP-5C and MKP3, however, shows that they have distinct conformations

[Fig. 1(b)]. In MKP3, the backbone amides from the Ploop do not point toward the active-site pocket, and the P-loop conformations are substantially distorted. Fur° thermore, the general acid Asp262 is $5 A from that of Asp232 in DUSP-5C. Although MKP3 and DUSP5 belong to the same subclass,4 fewer Ca atoms of MKP3 ° (121 Ca atoms, rms deviation of 1.3 A) could be aligned with those of DUSP-5C than of VHR. This might be due to the substantial deviation in the conformation encompassing the P-loop, a general acid loop, and the loops surrounding the P-loop, all of which are critical for proper enzymatic reaction [Fig. 1(b,c)]. The difference in the active conformation in MKP3 might be related to

well-known substrate-induced activation.25 The catalytic activation of MKPs is thought to be achieved by the interaction of the MAPK binding domain with the MAPK substrate; however, the activity of DUSP5 is not enhanced by binding extracellular signal-regulated kinase2 and the basal activity of DUSP5 is greater than the activity of MKP3 when it is fully activated upon substrate binding.26 This observation agrees with the active conformation of DUSP5-C.

In the crystal, DUSP5-C forms a dimer [Fig. 1(d)]. There were three DUSP5-C molecules in the asymmetric unit, where one DUSP5-C formed a dimer with its twofold crystallographic symmetric mate and the other two DUSP5-Cs were related by twofold NCS. The arrangement of dimeric contacts found in crystallographic dimer was essentially the same as that found in NCS dimer. DUSP5-C dimer was stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network between main-chain atoms from two b-strands

(b4 from each protomer, residues 223­227) resulting in formation of a central 10 b-stranded sheet upon dimerization. In addition, the hydrophobic interactions between the residues (Met220, Thr215, Tyr225, and Trp227) in dimeric interface also stabilized the dimer. The CNS program calculated that dimerization buried the surface of protomer by $11%.13 The buried surface for the dimer ° related by NCS was 793 A2, whereas total surface area of ° its protomer was 7215 A2. Similarly, that for dimer ° related by crystallographic twofold symmetry was 793 A2 ° while total surface area for its protomer was 7427 A2. Overall, the dimeric contacts observed in this crystal structure are aligned antiparallel to the b-strands. This is the first example of a PTP structure, which are reminiscent of antioxidant protein, peroxiredoxin.27 The positions of dimeric interface observed in the crystal structure are shared by those of strand b40 of MKP3 (pdb code: 1MKP) as shown in Figure 1(c). Hence, we speculated that the DUSP5 might adopt active conformation through steric clash upon dimerization. Interestingly, the DUSP5-C structure reveals an extra sulfate ion near the active site [Fig. 1(e)]. The second sulfate ion (Sulf2) is adjacent to the active site pocket in a nearby shallow cleft created by three arginine residues (Arg269 from the P-loop and Arg213 and Arg214 from ° the loop b3-b4). The Sulf2 is $7.3 A from Sulf1 and strongly coordinated with the side chains of three argi° nine residues (NH2 in Arg269­OS1 in Sulf2, 2.8 A; NH1 ° ; NE1 in Arg213­OS2 in in Arg269­OS2 in Sulf2, 2.8 A ° ° Sulf2, 3.0 A; NH2 in Arg213­OS3 in Sulf2, 3.1 A; NH1 ° in Arg214­OS4 in Sulf2, 2.9 A). The double arginine motif (Arg213 and Arg214) for coordinating sulfate ion found in DUSP5 is a characteristic of and unique to in all DSPs.

We developed two hypotheses to explain the existence of an extra sulfate binding site. One is that this extra binding site participates in phosphothreonine (pT) binding in the conserved pTXpY motif (where pT represents phosphothrenonie) in MAPK. The other is that DUSP5 act as mRNA capping enzyme. When we superimposed the structure of baculovirus RNA triphosphatase28 (pdb code:1YN9) on our structure of DUSP5, the position of the bound phosphate ion, which is expected to be that of a-phosphate in RNA 50 -triphosphate, completely coincided with that of our Sulf2 ion. Further biological experiments, however, are required to determine the validity of these hypotheses. In summary, we determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of DUSP5 in an active conformation, which explained why the activity of DUSP5 was not affected by substrate binding. DUSP5-C is the first known PTP to form a dimer in head-to-tail manner. We also found that DUSP5-C possessed an extra positively charged binding pocket, which may be useful for the development of specific inhibitors, and hence may help elucidate the biological function of DUSP5. The atomic coordinates of final structure has been deposited to PDB with the code 2G6Z.
