ABSTRACT: The nature of the putative general acid His187 in the reaction catalyzed by Escherichia coli uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) was investigated using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of H187Q UDG, and its complex with uracil, have been solved at 1.40 and 1.60 Å resolution, respectively. The structures are essentially identical to those of the wild-type enzyme, except that the side chain of Gln187 is turned away from the uracil base and cannot interact with uracil O2. This result provides a structural basis for the similar kinetic properties of the H187Q and H187A enzymes. The ionization state of His187 was directly addressed with 1H-15N NMR experiments optimized for histidine ring spin systems, which established that His187 is neutral in the catalytically active state of the enzyme (pKa <5.5). These NMR experiments also show that His187 is held in the N 2-H tautomeric form, consistent with the crystallographic observation of a 2.9 Å hydrogen bond from the backbone nitrogen of Ser189 to the ring N1 of His187. The energetic cost of breaking this hydrogen bond may contribute significantly to the low pKa of His187. Thus, the traditional view that a cationic His187 donates a proton to uracil O2 is incorrect. Rather, we propose a concerted mechanism involving general base catalysis by Asp64 and electrophilic stabilization of the developing enolate on uracil O2 by a neutral His187.

The enzymatic repair of damaged bases in DNA often begins with hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond to release the damaged base. An important question regarding the mechanism of this reaction is whether the enzyme activates the base for departure. It is reasonable to expect that a purine base may be activated by protonation or alkylation at N1, N3, or N7, and this is supported by solution and enzymatic studies (1, 2). However, it is highly questionable whether an enzyme can activate a damaged pyrimidine base by protonation at O2 or O4, due to the extremely low pKa (3.4) of these carbonyl oxygens (3). The mechanism of pyrimidine-specific glycosylases may therefore proceed without preequilibrium protonation of the leaving group base or by a concerted mechanism in which a proton or a hydrogen bond is donated to stabilize the developing enolate in the transition state. The DNA repair enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of premutagenic uracil bases in DNA, provides an attractive system to study this question in detail. A general acid-base mechanism has been proposed for UDG whereby a cationic histidine residue donates a proton to uracil O2 and an

aspartate residue activates a water molecule for nucleophilic attack at C1 of the deoxyribose (4-6). Although it has recently been proposed that His187 may be neutral during the catalytic cycle of UDG (7, 8), direct evidence of the ionization state of His187 in the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex is lacking. In the preceding paper of this issue we provide evidence, from mutagenesis and pH-rate studies of Escherichia coli UDG, that supports a role for Asp64 as the general base (9). Additionally, we find that conversion of His187 to glutamine or alanine by mutagenesis results in as much as a 4.8 kcal/mol destabilization of the transition state (9). However, the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters provides no evidence for a catalytically essential acidic group over the pH range 5-10 in the free enzyme or the enzymesubstrate complex (9). Taken together, the structural, mutagenesis, and kinetic evidence indicates that His187 forms an essential interaction with uracil O2 in the transition state. However, the important question of whether His187 is cationic with an exceptionally high pKa (>10) or neutral with an unusually low pKa (<5) remains unanswered. Bachovchin, among others, has shown that 15N NMR spectroscopy is an excellent method to unambiguously determine the ionization state of a histidine ring in a protein or enzyme (10-13). This is because the 15N chemical shift of an imidazole nitrogen depends dramatically on its electronic hybridization state and whether it has a bonded hydrogen atom (14, 15). Thus, the two 15N resonances from

The highresolution X-ray crystal structures of H187Q UDG and the H187Q-uracil product complex show that the overall conformation and orientation of the active site residues of H187Q UDG are very similar to those of wild-type UDG. Surprisingly, the side chain of Gln187 exhibits no direct interaction with the bound uracil base. This provides a structural explanation for the similar kinetics and DNA binding properties of the H187Q and H187A enzymes (9). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES1 General. Wild-type and H187Q UDG from E. coli strain B were produced using a T7 polymerase-based expression system and purified to >99% homogeneity as described (7). The stable substrate analogue pU PA,2 which contains deoxyuridine with a 2- -fluorine substitution (U ) and the fluorescent reporter 2-aminopurine (P), was synthesized and purified as previously described (9, 18). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of pU PA gave a mass of 953.7, compared to the calculated mass of 952.6 (Midland Certified Reagent Co., Midland, TX). Isotopic Labeling of UDG for Heteronuclear NMR. Uniformly 15N-labeled UDG samples were prepared by growing the BLR(DE3)plysS cells, containing the pET21(UDG) or pET21(H187Q) plasmid, in MOPS minimal media (19) with 1.0 g/L 15N-labeled (>99 atom %) ammonium chloride (Martek Biosciences, Columbia, MD) as the sole nitrogen source. The UDG sample containing 13C-15Nlabeled histidine and proline residues was prepared by growing the UDG expression cells in MOPS minimal media containing 0.2 g/L each of the natural L-amino acids except histidine and proline. When the OD600 reached 0.8, the uniformly 13C-15N-labeled L-histidine (Martek Biosciences) and uniformly 13C-15N-labeled L-proline (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) were added at a final concentration of 0.1 g/L. The cells were induced 15 min after the labeled amino acids were added. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection. The H187Q E. coli UDG was crystallized in the same space group and under the same conditions as described for wild-type E. coli UDG (7). The H187Q-uracil complex crystals were prepared by soaking the H187Q crystals in stabilizing buffer

FIGURE 1: Nomenclature used for histidine rings and peak patterns expected in the 2D 1H-15N LR-HSQC spectra for the three possible tautomeric states of a histidine ring (13). The 15N chemical shifts are from studies of histidine, N1-methylhistidine, and N 2-methylhistidine in water at 25 °C (16), and the 1H chemical shifts are from histidine residues in random coils (37). The 15N chemical shifts are referenced to external liquid ammonia and were converted by subtracting the reported value, referenced to 1 M HNO3, from 377.5 ppm (13). The ring nitrogens have three two-bond J couplings to the carbon-attached protons (N1-H 1, N 2-H 1, and N 2-H2), which are usually observed in the 2D LR-HSQC, and one threebond J coupling (N1-H2), which is usually not observed (13, 15, 17).

a neutral histidine ring will differ by about 80 ppm, whereas the 15N resonances from a cationic histidine ring will differ by only 2 ppm (Figure 1) (11, 15, 16). The sensitivity and resolution of the 15N spectrum can be significantly improved by using a two-dimensional 1H-15N long-range HSQC (LRHSQC) experiment, which correlates the two histidine ring nitrogens with the two carbon-attached protons as shown in Figure 1 (13, 17). We have investigated the nature of uracil leaving group activation by His187 in E. coli UDG using crystallographic and heteronuclear NMR methods. Despite the large size of the enzyme (25.5 kDa) and the presence of 13 other histidine residues, we were able to unambiguously assign the NMR resonances of His187 using the approaches of mutagenesis and selective labeling with 13C-15N-enriched amino acids. Using 2D LR-HSQC experiments, we have found that His187 is neutral in the free enzyme over the pH range of 5.5-9.5 and in the UDG complex with a stable 2-fluoro2-deoxyuridine substrate analogue (18) at pH 6.0 and 6.8. Thus, the pKa of His187 is below 5.0 in the free enzyme and below 5.5 in the enzyme-substrate complex. In contrast

Drohat et al. detection in the indirect dimensions was obtained by StatesTPPI phase cycling (26). Data were processed on a Silicon Graphics workstation using the NMRPipe computer program (27). Data in the 15N dimension were extended 2-fold using the standard linear prediction routine in NMRPipe. In general, the NMR samples contained 0.3-1.0 mM UDG, 0.01 M NaH2PO4, pH 6.6 (unless noted otherwise), 0.25 M NaCl, and 5% D2O. The conventional 2D 1H-15N HSQC experiments (28), for observation of backbone amide 1H-15N correlations, were in general collected at 25 °C with 16-24 scans, 64 complex t1 points and 1024 complex t2 points, and with 15N decoupling by WALTZ-16 (29) with a 1.0 kHz field. For the 0.6 mM 13C-15N His-Pro-labeled wild-type UDG sample, the 2D 1 H-15N HSQC was collected at 600 MHz with acquisition times of 29.2 ms in t1 and 122 ms in t2 and with the 1H and 15N carriers at 4.78 and 118.4 ppm. For the 0.5 mM uniformly 15N-labeled H187Q UDG sample, the 2D 1H15 N HSQC was collected at 500 MHz with acquisition times of 35.1 ms in t1 and 114 ms in t2 and with the 1H and 15N carriers at 4.81 and 118.4 ppm. The 2D 1H-15N LR-HSQC experiments were collected to correlate the histidine ring N1 and N 2 nitrogens with the H2 and H 1 ring protons (Figure 1). This experiment was simply a conventional HSQC used for backbone amide correlations (28) collected with a dephasing delay of 22 ms in order to observe signals from the weak two-bond 2JNH couplings in the histidine rings and suppress signals from the one-bond JNH amide couplings (13). The LR-HSQC spectra for the uniformly 15N-labeled wild-type UDG (0.8 mM) and H187Q UDG (0.4 mM) samples were collected at 500 MHz at 25 or 30 °C and with the 1H and 15N carriers at 4.81 and 210.4 ppm, respectively. The spectra were collected at pH values of 5.5, 6.6, 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5 for the wild-type sample and at pH values of 6.6 and 7.5 for the H187Q sample. The 15N dimension was collected with 23-40 complex points and a 110 ppm sweep width, and the 1H dimension was collected with 1024 complex points and a 12.0 ppm sweep width. The complexes of uniformly 15Nlabeled wild-type and H187Q UDG with pU PA were collected at 600 MHz at 25 °C, with the 1H and 15N carriers at 4.79 and 210.4 ppm, respectively. The wild-type and H187Q UDG samples at pH 6.8 contained 0.5 mM UDG and 1.0 mM pU PA, and the wild-type sample at pH 6.0 contained 0.25 mM UDG and 0.5 mM pU PA. The 15N dimension was collected with 32 complex points and a 120 ppm sweep width, and the 1H dimension was collected with 1024 complex points and a 16.0 ppm sweep width. Decoupling of 15N was accomplished with the GARP sequence (30) using a 1.39 kHz field. The 3D 15N-edited NOESY experiment (31) was collected on a 1.0 mM uniformly 15N-labeled wild-type UDG sample, pH 7.50, at 500 MHz and 25 °C. The 1H and 15N carriers were at 4.76 and 120.4 ppm, respectively, and 16 scans were collected per FID. The acquisition times and number of complex points were 11.2 ms and 90 points in t1 (1H), 14.8 ms and 30 points in t2 (15N), and 114 ms and 1024 points in t3 (1H). Decoupling of 15N was accomplished with WALTZ16 (29) at a 1.39 kHz field. The CBCA(CO)NH experiment (32) was collected on a 0.6 mM uniformly 13C-15N His-Pro-labeled wild-type UDG sample. The experiment was executed in a 1D mode by

containing 6.0 mM uracil for 3 h. The diffraction data for free H187Q UDG were collected at the IMCA-CAT beamline 17-ID of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). The diffraction data for the H187Q-uracil complex were collected with a HISTAR electronic area detector on a rotating anode X-ray generator (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI). ¨ During data collection on both instruments, Oxford Cryostreams (Oxford Cryostreams, U.K.) maintained the crystals near 115 K. The diffraction data were indexed and processed with X-GEN (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) (20). The diffraction results are summarized in Table 1. Crystal Structure Refinement. The starting model for the refinements of free H187Q UDG and the H187Q-uracil complex structures was the 1.43 Å resolution structure of the Y19H E. coli UDG glycerol complex (7). The residues His187 and His19 were changed to alanine in the starting models to avoid biasing the refinement. The two glycerol molecules were omitted, and the first 200 water molecules were retained in the model. This model was refined with SHELX-97 (21, 22) against data for H187Q UDG and its complex with uracil. After 10 cycles of refinement, the residues Gln187 and Tyr19 were clearly defined in the Fo - Fc maps of both structures, and the uracil was clearly defined in the Fo - Fc map of the H187Q-uracil complex. The molecular display and map fitting program TURBOFRODO (23) was used to examine and adjust the structure during the refinement process. The program PROCHECK (24) was used to examine the stereochemical parameters of the final structures. The refinement results are summarized in Table 1. NMR Spectroscopy. NMR experiments were conducted on Bruker DRX500 and DRX600 spectrometers, each equipped with four frequency channels and a triple-axis gradient 1H13C-15N probe. Proton chemical shifts are reported with respect to external DSS. The 13C and 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to DSS and liquid NH3, respectively, using the zero point frequency ratios 13C/1H ) 0.251449530 and 15N/1H ) 0.101329118 (25). Experiments were conducted with 1 s recycle delays, and quadrature

setting the 13C and 15N evolution periods to 3 µs and collecting 1024 scans. Thus, a backbone amide 1H signal was only detected for those histidine residues that were preceded by a histidine or proline residue in the primary sequence of UDG. The 1H acquisition time was 61 ms, and the 1H, 13C, and 15N carriers were set to 4.78, 48.4, and 117.4 ppm, respectively. Decoupling of 15N was by WALTZ-16 (29) with a 1.0 kHz field. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystal Structures of Free H187Q and the H187Q-Uracil Complex. The crystal structures of free H187Q UDG and the H187Q-uracil complex have been determined at 1.40 and 1.60 Å resolution, respectively. The final coordinates of both structures contain 225 of the 229 amino acid residues in E. coli UDG, as the four N-terminal residues were not observed. The structures of free H187Q UDG and the H187Q-uracil complex contain 298 and 248 water molecules, respectively. Ramachandran plots (33) for both structures show 92.1% of the residues in the most favorable region and no residues in the disallowed regions. A comparison of the 2Fo - Fc electron density maps and final coordinates shows good agreement between the two structures. An electron density map of the active site region from

each structure is shown in Figure 2. The final coordinates for the structures have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank under the ID codes 4EUG for free H187Q and 5EUG for the H187Q-uracil complex. Structural Comparisons at the ActiVe Site of H187Q and Wild-Type UDG. The crystal structures of H187Q UDG and its complex with uracil are nearly identical to those of wildtype UDG and its uracil complex when the orientations of active site residues are compared. As shown in Figure 3, the uracil recognition pocket is formed by the conserved residues Gln63, Asp64, Tyr66, Phe77, Ser88, Asn123, His187, and Ser189. When the CR atoms of these residues in H187Q and wild-type structures are superimposed, the RMSD is e0.23 Å for all active site residues and e0.44 Å for the His187-Gln187 pair. The orientation of the uracil molecule in each structure is also essentially the same. Thus, the H187Q mutation results in only minor and local perturbations to the structure of the free enzyme and its complex with uracil. Although the side chain amide group of Gln187 was expected to form a hydrogen bond with uracil O2 in a manner similar to that of His187, the structure reveals that the side chain of Gln187 is directed away from the uracil base (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3: Alignment of the active site residues of H187Q and wild-type UDG. (A, top) The active site residues of free H187Q (colored by atom type) align well with those of wild-type UDG (in pink), with an RMSD for CR superposition of 0.23 Å. (B, bottom) Active site residues in the H187Q-uracil complex also align well with the UDG-uracil complex, giving an RMSD for CR superposition of 0.14 Å. Dashed lines illustrate potential hydrogen bonds (distance < 3.5 Å).

complex is very close to a preferred glutamine 1 rotamer and differs by 97° from the 1 rotamer of His187 (7). This orientation results in a longer distance of 6.6 Å from Gln187 N 2 to uracil O2, compared to 4.2 Å from His187 N 2 to uracil O2. Thus, Gln187 appears to have no interaction with uracil, whereas H187 interacts with uracil O2 indirectly through a water-mediated hydrogen bond in the E. coli UDG-uracil complex and a direct hydrogen bond in the complex of human UDG with uracil and abasic DNA (7, 34). This is in agreement with the observation that the H187Q and H187A mutations have nearly identical damaging effects (9). In other words, Gln187 shows no greater interaction with uracil during catalysis than does Ala187. General NMR Assignment Strategy for His187. In the absence of complete chemical shift assignments for the backbone and side chain resonances, the selective assignment of histidine ring 1H and 15N resonances (Figure 1) in a protein or enzyme can be accomplished using three general approaches. First, all histidine residues except the one of interest can be mutated, as was done by Lodi and Knowles for two of the three histidines in triosephosphate isomerase (12). Second, a single histidine mutant can be generated, and its NMR spectrum can be compared with that of the wildtype enzyme to identify the signal which is missing in the mutant spectrum, as done by Bycroft and Fersht for subtilisin BPN (35). Third, the side chain resonances of a specific histidine can be assigned by scalar or NOE correlations with

its backbone resonances (13), which in turn may be assigned using selective 13C-15N labeling approaches. Selective labeling is particularly effective for histidine residues because cross-labeling of the 13C and 15N isotopes from histidine to other amino acids by metabolic scrambling is minimal (36). In addition, if the histidine residue of interest is preceded by another residue, such that the Xn-Hisn+1 pair is unique in the primary sequence, then the histidine backbone resonances will show exclusive scalar connectivities to the preceding residue if it is also selectively labeled with 13C and 15N. The first approach (mutation of all histidine residues except His187) was impractical for UDG, since it contains 14 histidine residues. Thus, assignment of the His187 ring 1H and 15N resonances was made by comparisons of the 2D 1H-15N LR-HSQC spectra for H187Q and wild-type UDG and by selective 13C and 15N labeling to assign the His187 backbone resonances. The backbone amide proton was then correlated with the His187 H2 ring resonance using 15Nedited NOE spectroscopy. Ionization State of His187 in Free UDG. The 2D 1H-15N LR-HSQC experiment, when optimized for histidine ring spin systems, correlates the N1 and N 2 resonances with the carbon-attached H2 and H 1 resonances via scalar couplings (Figure 1) (13, 17). It is clear from the expected peak patterns for a neutral vs cationic histidine ring shown in Figure 1 that the ionization state of a histidine ring can be readily obtained (13). In addition, the tautomeric form of a neutral

The spin systems are connected by solid black lines and numbered randomly with the assignment given for His187 and His73 (see text). Strip plots of the downfield resonances of His187 at pH 5.5 and 9.5 are also shown.

histidine ring can be revealed, providing unambiguous evidence as to which nitrogen is a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor (Figure 1). The LR-HSQC experiment was conducted with uniformly 15N-labeled samples of wild-type and H187Q UDG at pH 6.6. The LR-HSQC spectrum of free wild-type UDG shows 14 histidine ring spin systems, one for each of the 14 histidines in the UDG primary sequence (Figure 4, black peaks). Examination of Figure 4 shows that, for each of the histidine ring systems identified in the wild-type spectrum, a corresponding system is seen for the H187Q spectrum (red peaks), except for the system labeled 5 (H187). Therefore, system 5 in the wild-type UDG spectrum was assigned to His187. With the assignment of the His187 ring system established, a comparison of its peak pattern in Figure 4 with the expected patterns for neutral and cationic histidine rings (Figure 1) shows that His187 is neutral in the free enzyme at pH 6.6. To set an upper limit for the pKa of His187, the LR-HSQC spectra of the free enzyme were also acquired at pH 5.5, 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5. The downfield resonances of His187 at the limiting pH values of 5.5 and 9.5 are shown as strip plots in Figure 4. It is clear from these spectra that the nitrogen chemical shifts for His187 remain the same at pH 5.5 and 9.5 as compared to pH 6.6, establishing that His187 is also neutral at these pH values. This result requires that the pKa of His187 is e5.0 in the free enzyme. A pKa e5.0 is in agreement with the pH dependence of kcat/Km for UDG, which shows no evidence for an essential protonated group over the pH range 5-10 (9). The nitrogen-attached H 2 proton of His187 is not observed in a conventional 2D 1H-15N HSQC experiment optimized for one-bond 1H-15N correlations, indicating that this proton exchanges freely with solvent. This solution NMR result is consistent with the UDG crystal structure, which shows that His187 N 2-H is hydrogen bonded to an ordered water molecule.

SelectiVe Labeling Confirms the Chemical Shift Assignments of His187 in Free UDG. To confirm that the mutagenesis approach provided the correct assignments for the His187 ring correlations, the backbone HN and 15N resonances of His187 were assigned using selective 13C15N labeling, and these resonances were correlated to the H2 ring proton of His187 using a 3D 15N-edited NOESY experiment (31). Since His187 is the only histidine residue in the primary sequence that is preceded by a proline residue (Pro186), selective 13C and 15N labeling of both histidine and proline residues was performed. The rationale for this approach is that the CBCA(CO)NH experiment can be used to correlate the 13CR and 13C resonances of residue i with the backbone HN and 15N resonances of residue i + 1 (32). Accordingly, the 13CR, resonances of Pro186 can be correlated with the backbone HN and 15N resonances of His187, with the signal observed on the HN of His187. There is also a His-His pair in the primary sequence of UDG (His180His181), so we expected to observe an additional HN resonance from His181 due to the labeling of this sequential pair. Since the selective labeling protocol negated resonance overlap and because the 3D version of the CBCA(CO)NH yielded very little signal due to fast T2 relaxation effects, a 1D version of this experiment was used. In the 1D version, the detected amide proton signal is edited for the attached 15N as well as scalar connectivities to the 13CR and 13C resonances of the preceding residue. As expected, only two HN resonances are observed in the 1D CBCA(CO)NH spectrum (Figure 5A). To determine which of the two HN resonances is from His187, we compared the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of wild-type UDG (selectively 13C-15N-labeled at His and Pro residues) and H187Q UDG (uniformly 15N-labeled). Figure 5B shows that for each backbone amide correlation peak seen in the wildtype UDG spectrum (black, histidines only), a nearly overlapping peak is seen in the H187Q spectrum (red, all

FIGURE 5: Assignment of the His187 backbone 1H-15N and ring H2 chemical shifts. (A) The 1D CBCA(CO)NH spectrum of wild-type UDG selectively labeled with 13C-15N histidine and proline residues shows the expected two HN resonances for His181 and His187 (see text). (B) An overlay of the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of wild-type 13C-15N His-Pro-labeled UDG (black peaks) and uniformly 15Nlabeled H187Q (red peaks) shows that the only wild-type peak not present in the H187Q UDG spectrum is the one in the box, which aligns exactly with the upfield peak (His187) in the 1D CBCA(CO)NH spectrum. (C) A 2D 1H-1H strip from the 3D 15N-edited NOESY experiment (15N ) 117.9 ppm) shows an NOE correlation from the HN of His187 to a proton with a chemical shift of 7.45 ppm, which exactly matches that of the H2 of His187 shown in the 2D 1H-15N LR-HSQC spectra of free UDG (Figure 4). NOE correlations to other protons close in space to His187 HN are also shown with potential assignments made as described in the text.

residues), except for the single peak enclosed in the box. This peak aligns exactly with the upfield HN resonance in the 1D CBCA(CO)NH spectrum (Figure 5A) and is therefore assigned to His187. With this assignment in hand, we could search for NOE correlations between the HN of His187 and its ring protons using the 3D 15N-edited NOESY experiment.3 A 1H-1H strip from the 3D 15N NOESY spectrum (at the 15N chemical shift of His187-N) shows a weak NOE correlation from the HN of His187 to a proton with a chemical shift of 7.45 ppm (Figure 5C). This chemical shift exactly matches that of the H2 proton of the spin system assigned to His187 in the 1H-15N LR-HSQC spectrum (Figure 4) and thus confirms our assignment of the His187 ring system. The observation of this weak NOE correlation is in agreement with the crystal structure of free UDG, which shows a distance of 5.0 Å from His187 HN to His187 H2 (7). Also labeled in Figure 5C are the likely assignments for NOE correlations from His187 HN to His187 HR (2.9 Å) and H 1, 2 (2.3 and 2.5 Å), Gly165 HN (3.5 Å) and HR1,R2 (2.9 and 3.7 Å), Pro186 HR (2.5 Å) and H 1, 2 (2.9 and 3.4 Å), and Ser192 H 1, 2 (3.0 and 3.9 Å). These assignments are consistent with the random coil chemical shifts for protons in these residue types (37) and the distances between

His187 HN and these protons in the crystal structure of free UDG (7). His187 Is Also Neutral in the Enzyme-Substrate Complex. The ionization state of His187 in the complex of UDG with the stable 2-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine substrate analogue, pU PA, was investigated using the LR-HSQC experiment (9, 18). The analogue pU PA is an excellent substrate mimic because it is competitively displaced from UDG by uracil and the tighter binding substrate analogue AU A-5 (9). In addition, the KD of 2.1 ( 0.1 µM for pU PA is similar to the Km of 1.3 ( 0.2 µM for the corresponding 2- -H substrate pUPA (9). Finally, pU PA is hydrolyzed by UDG to uracil and abasic DNA but at a 107-fold slower rate than the corresponding 2- -H substrate pUPA (t1/2 of pU PA 70 days; data not shown). This 107-fold rate diminishment due to the 2- -F substitution is similar to that previously reported (18) and has no effect on the NMR experiments described below because the spectra were acquired in e2 days. Figure 6 shows an overlay of the LR-HSQC spectra for the complexes of pU PA with wild-type UDG (black peaks) and H187Q UDG (red peaks). A comparison of the black and red peaks in Figure 6 shows that the spectra of the UDG-pU PA and H187Q-pU PA complexes overlay very well. The 15N chemical shifts of all observable resonances are essentially identical in both spectra of Figure 6, with only minor perturbations in the 1H chemical shifts of spin systems

FIGURE 6: Overlay of the 2D 1H-15N LR-HSQC spectra for the complexes of pU PA with wild-type UDG (black peaks) and H187Q UDG (red peaks) at pH 6.8 and the His187 spectral region of the wild-type UDG-pU PA complex at pH 6.0. The spin systems are numbered to correspond with those in the free enzyme (Figure 4). A strip plot of the downfield resonances of His187 at pH 6.0 is also shown. Indicated by the arrow, the H2 proton of system 13 resonates upfield at 5.97 ppm.

3, 6, 8, 9, and 13 ( e 0.1 ppm). Spin system 11 in the free UDG spectra (Figure 4) is absent in the spectra for both wild-type and H187Q UDG in complex with pU PA, presumably due to exchange broadening upon binding pU PA. The assignment of the His187 spin system in the UDGpU PA complex is based on two observations. First, the only spin system missing in the H187Q-pU PA spectrum that is present in the wild-type spectrum is that labeled 5 (His187) in Figure 6. Second, very little change in the 1H-15N chemical shifts of the His187 ring are seen when comparing the LR-HSQC spectra of free UDG and the UDG-pU PA complex (Figures 4 and 6,  1H2 ) 0.13 ppm,  1H 2 ) 0.02 ppm,  15N1 ) 4.1 ppm, and  15N 2 ) 4.5 ppm). From a comparison of the reference 1H-15N peak patterns in Figure 1 with those observed for the His187 pU PA spectrum (Figure 6), it is clear that His187 remains neutral in the enzyme-substrate complex at pH 6.8. To set limits on the pKa for His187 in the enzyme-substrate complex, we collected the 2D LR-HSQC spectrum of the wild-type UDG-pU PA complex at pH 6.0 and found that His187 is also neutral at pH 6.0 (Figure 6). Thus, consistent with the pH dependence of kcat (9), these NMR results require that the pKa of His187 is e5.5 in the enzyme-substrate complex. These results effectively exclude the involvement of a cationic His187 in the catalytic mechanism of UDG. Structural Basis for the Low pKa of His187. Inspection of the crystal structures of free UDG, as well as the uracil and abasic DNA complexes, indicates that the less favorable G for protonation of His187 relative to free imidazole, i.e., its low pKa, is likely due to a significant and unfavorable reorganizational energy. This conclusion is based on the observation of a 2.9 Å hydrogen bond from the N1 of His187 to the backbone nitrogen of Ser189 in the crystal structures

of E. coli UDG and its uracil complex (Figure 3) (7). The same interaction is seen in the crystal structures of human UDG and its ternary complexes with uracil and duplex abasic DNA (5, 34, 38), and herpes virus UDG and its complex with uracil (4). Since this hydrogen bond must be broken before the His187 ring can become cationic, the apparent G for protonation of His187 will include an unfavorable contribution from the work required for this reorganization. Characterization of the 13 Other Histidines in UDG. Examination of the crystal structure and the 2D LR-HSQC NMR spectra of free E. coli UDG provides the specific assignment of one more histidine residue and narrows the possible assignments of four other histidine residues. Spin system 6 can be unambiguously assigned to His73, because only His73 has the hydrogen bonds required to stabilize the N1-H tautomeric form as observed for system 6 in Figures 4 and 6 (7). The assignment of spin systems 1 through 4 can be narrowed to His108, His136, His180, and His202, because only these histidine residues (with the exception of His187) have the hydrogen bonds required to stabilize the observed N 2-H tautomeric form (Figure 4) (7). Spin systems 1 through 4 are also unique, because the nitrogen-attached H 2 proton was observed in 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra optimized for one-bond 1H-15N correlations (not shown). This result indicates that exchange of the H 2 proton with solvent is inhibited. Accordingly, the crystal structure shows that each of these four histidines participates in an intramolecular hydrogen bond that could inhibit the exchange of H 2 with solvent (7). The remaining eight histidines are mostly solvent exposed, titrate in the pH range 6-7 (not shown), and remain unassigned. To our knowledge, this is the largest number of histidine ring systems resolved in a protein using NMR methods. The high resolution and sensitivity of the 1H-15N LR-HSQC experiment for histidine ring systems,

FIGURE 7: Catalytic mechanism for UDG and relative stabilities of complexes along the reaction pathway for H187Q (black) and D64N (gray) UDG. The relative stabilities are expressed as difference free energies (G ) Gmut - Gwt). The free energies for the ground state complexes were calculated from the measured binding constants for AU A-5 and uracil (9) using the Gibbs equation G° ) -RT ln(1/KD), and the activation free energies were calculated from Gq ) -RT ln kmax(h/kT) using the kmax value of 150 s-1 for AUP-5 (9). The difference free energies are shown for the flipped-out uridine nucleotide complex (EF), the transition state ([EF]q), and the uracil product complex (EU) following release of the abasic DNA product (D) (9). A distinct conformational form of the enzyme is designated by E on the basis of previous structural and kinetic studies (18, 34). The side chain groups of Asp64 and His187 stabilize the transition state significantly but the ground states only weakly (9). The proposed mechanism involves concerted general base catalysis by Asp64 and electrophilic stabilization of the developing enolate on uracil O2 by a neutral His187. In accord with the crystal structure of the UDGuracil complex (7), a water molecule is shown bridging His187 N 2-H and uracil O2 in the EU complex. The contribution of Asn123 to transition state stabilization is not yet clear because substitution of valine for this group in the human enzyme resulted in large effects on both DNA binding and catalysis (38).

even for a complex system such as UDG, suggest it may be used effectively for other proteins of similar size and complexity. A comparison of Figures 4 and 6 shows that the histidine ring systems seen in the UDG-pU PA complex spectra are in the same tautomeric state with similar 15N chemical shifts as for free UDG. The two exceptions are system 11, which is absent in the spectrum for the complex, and system 12, which shows greatly diminished intensity. Both of these effects are probably due to exchange broadening upon forming the complex with pU PA. The exchange broadening of two histidine ring spin systems is not unexpected, since His67 and His134 are in the DNA binding cleft of UDG (7). Weak Hydrogen Bonding to Uracil O2 in the EnzymeSubstrate Complex. The His187 N1 and N 2 resonances show changes in 15N chemical shift upon forming the complex with pU PA (Figures 4 and 6), which may reflect a weakening of the hydrogen bonds involving these atoms upon forming the enzyme-substrate complex. The upfield 15N resonance of His187 (N 2-H) moves further upfield by 4.5 ppm upon forming the pU PA complex, similar to the 4 ppm upfield change seen for the 15N1 nitrogen of N1-methylimidazole in going from water, a good hydrogen bond acceptor, to benzene or chloroform, which are poor hydrogen bond

acceptors (16). This result suggests that the hydrogen bond between His187 N 2-H and uracil O2 in the enzymesubstrate complex is weaker than the 2.6 Å hydrogen bond between His187 N 2-H and an ordered water molecule in free UDG (7) and is consistent with the small effect of the H187Q mutation on the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex (9). The downfield 15N resonance of His187 (N1) moves further downfield by 4.1 ppm upon forming the pU PA complex. This may be compared with the 9 and 17 ppm downfield changes for the N 2 nitrogen of N1-methylimidazole in going from water to benzene and chloroform, respectively (16). This suggests that the hydrogen bond between His187 N1 and Ser189 HN in free UDG (7) may also be weakened upon formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. Role for Neutral Electrophiles in Enzymatic Catalysis. The question of why a neutral electrophile has been selected by evolution to stabilize a negatively charged transition state has been encountered previously by Lodi and Knowles in their studies of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). Similar to our findings, His95 of TIM has a pKa below 4.5, which was partially attributed to a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of Glu97 to the N1 of His95. In addition, TIM stabilizes an enediolate transition state that is similar to the suggested O2 enolate transition state in the UDG reaction

Catalysis by Uracil DNA Glycosylase (12). The observation that these two enzymes use neutral electrophiles is somewhat surprising, because simple electrostatic considerations suggest that a cationic electrophile should provide greater catalysis by preferential stabilization of a negatively charged transition state over that of a neutral ground state. The selection for a neutral electrophile may simply reflect that the nonpolar active site of UDG required for catalysis cannot accommodate a cationic electrophile. An additional advantage of a neutral histidine may be that its pKa would approximate that of the enolic transition state (pKa  10-13) (39, 40). This matching of pKa values between donor and acceptor would increase the hydrogen bond energy in the transition state, as discussed below (12, 41). Finally, it has been proposed that matching pKa values in the transition state can allow formation of a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) (42). Such a LBHB was proposed for TIM (43, 44), but recent NMR studies suggest that a regular hydrogen bond is sufficient to account for the contribution of His95 to catalysis (45). Currently, we have no evidence that a LBHB is involved in the UDG reaction (9). Can a Neutral Hydrogen Bond Account for the 4.8 kcal/ mol Transition State Stabilization of His187? Shan and Herschlag have conducted model studies that directly address the energetics of hydrogen bond formation between a neutral donor and a negatively charged acceptor (41). In this work, the free energy of hydrogen bonding (GHB) was determined as a function of the pKa difference between the donor and acceptor (pKa). A linear dependence of GHB upon pKa was observed, with a much steeper dependence in dimethyl sulfoxide (GHB/pKa ) 1.0 kcal/mol) than in water (GHB/ pKa ) 0.07 kcal/mol) (41). The steeper dependence of GHB on pKa in DMSO is most simply explained by the greater Coulombic attraction between the partial effective charges on the donor and acceptor in this less polar solvent. These results suggest that a hydrogen bond between a donor-acceptor pair in a nonaqueous enzyme active site would be stronger than the corresponding hydrogen bond in water and would approach a maximum as pKa approached zero. In the case of UDG, the pKa between His187 N 2-H and uracil O2 may decrease by at least 14 pKa units, as uracil O2 converts from a carbonylic oxygen in the ground state (pKa ) -3.7) to an enolic oxygen in the transition state (pKa  10-13). Accordingly, if the UDG active site resembles DMSO, the transition state could be stabilized by 14 kcal/ mol relative to the ground state [GHB ) pKa(GHB/ pKa)DMSO ) 14 × 1.0 ) 14]. Alternatively, if the UDG active site resembles an aqueous environment, the selective stabilization would only be 1 kcal/mol [pKa(GHB/pKa)H2O ) 14 × 0.07 ) 1]. Although there is uncertainty in directly relating a mutagenic effect to hydrogen bond energy, these approximations show that a neutral hydrogen bond from His187 N 2-H to uracil O2 in a moderately nonpolar active site could easily account for the experimentally observed 4.8 kcal/mol transition state stabilization attributed to His187 (9). Conclusion. The catalytic mechanism of uracil glycosidic bond cleavage by uracil DNA glycosylase has been elucidated (Figure 7). We propose a concerted mechanism of electrophilic and general base catalysis by His187 and Asp64, respectively, on the basis that (i) these residues interact weakly with the ground state and strongly with the transition state and (ii) His187 is neutral such that preequilibrium protonation of uracil in the ground state is energetically

Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 37, 1999 11885 untenable. In general, a concerted mechanism may be required for hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond in pyrimidine bases because of the highly unfavorable thermodynamics for protonating the pyrimidine carbonyl oxygens in the ground state. This concerted mechanism differs considerably from the mechanism suggested for several purine N-ribohydrolases, which involves preequilibrium protonation of the purine base in the enzyme-substrate complex (46, 47). Thus, similar to the reactions in aqueous solution, the mechanism of enzyme-mediated glycosidic bond cleavage in pyrimidine and purine nucleosides is determined by the acidity of the leaving base.
