Strasbourg France viremia, and leads to miscarriage in pregnant animals, resulting in economic disaster in African countries. RVFV possesses a single-stranded segmented RNA genome of negative or ambisense polarity composed of a large (L), a medium (M), and a small (S) segment (Schmaljohn and Hooper, 2001). The L and M segments code for the L RNA-dependent polymerase and the glycoproteins precursor, respectively. S codes for the N nucleoprotein and the nonstructural NSs protein in an ambisense strategy (Giorgi et al., 1991). To evade the host response, viruses have evolved mechanisms, which disrupt normal cellular functions. In this respect, the host transcriptional apparatus represents a logical target for inhibition by cytopathic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm without any need for host transcriptional machinery (for review, Lyles, 2000). Indeed, poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus were shown to target and modify components of the RNA pol II transcriptional machinery (Crawford et al., 1981; Yalamanchili et al., 1996; Yuan et al., 1998). In the case of RVFV, little is known about the effect of infection on the cellular functions. Although the virus replicates in the cytoplasm, NSs forms filamentous structures in the nucleus (Struthers and Swanepoel, 1982; Yadani et al., 1999). It is therefore possible that the NSs viral protein disrupts some host nuclear pathway such as transcription. TFIIH, one of the basal transcription factors also involved in DNA repair and likely cell cycle regulation, could be a putative candidate for viral protein targeting. This multisubunit factor, can be resolved in two subcomplexes: the core that contains XPB, p62, p52, p44, and p34, is bridged by the XPD subunit to the CAK (cdk activating kinase), in which cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1 are present (Zurita and Merino, 2003). TFIIH possesses several enzymatic activities: (1) the XPB helicase participates in promoter opening; (2) cdk7 phosphorylates RNA pol II as well as a number of transcriptional activators to control gene expression; and (3) XPD the second helicase, interacts with and is regulated by the p44 subunit of the core TFIIH. Disruption of XPD/p44 interaction inhibits the XPD helicase activity (Coin et al., 1998) and prevents accurate phosphorylation of certain nuclear receptors by CAK. This results in a decreased transactivation of genes under their control (Keriel et al., 2002), a biochemical feature observed in xeroderma pigmentosum and trichothiodystrophy patients (Lehmann, 2001). Here, we demonstrate that NSs, the nonstructural RVFV protein present in the host cell nucleus, interacts with the p44 subunit of TFIIH. Confocal microscopy demonstrates that the nucleus of RVFV-infected cells contains filamentous structures, which include not only NSs but also some subunits of the core TFIIH. These results lead to the following mechanism: by sequestering the p44 and XPB subunits within the nuclear filament, NSs subverts the assembly of TFIIH subunits into a mature complex and induces a reduction in cellular TFIIH concentration explaining the dramatic drop in RNA synthesis observed upon RVFV infection.

Summary The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is the causative agent of fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and acute hepatitis in ruminants. We found that infection by RVFV leads to a rapid and drastic suppression of host cellular RNA synthesis that parallels a decrease of the TFIIH transcription factor cellular concentration. Using yeast two hybrid system, recombinant technology, and confocal microscopy, we further demonstrated that the nonstructural viral NSs protein interacts with the p44 component of TFIIH to form nuclear filamentous structures that also contain XPB subunit of TFIIH. By competing with XPD, the natural partner of p44 within TFIIH, and sequestering p44 and XPB subunits, NSs prevents the assembly of TFIIH subunits, thus destabilizing the normal host cell life. These observations shed light on the mechanism utilized by RVFV to evade the host response. Introduction The Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) is a member of the Bunyaviridae that include pathogens such as CrimeanCongo, Hantaan, and Sin Nombre viruses (Elliott et al., 2000). RVFV, transmitted mostly by Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, infects humans and cattle in Africa (Linthicum et al., 1999; Turell et al., 1996) and has recently spread to Yemen and Saudi Arabia (Anonymous, 2000a, 2000b). This arbovirus can persist in nature for several years in infected mosquito eggs and might reappear during high rainfall after egg hatching. In humans, infection can lead to a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from benign to severe encephalitis, retinitis, and fatal hepatitis with hemorrhagic fever. RVFV infects also cattle, goats, camels, and sheep that develop very high

NSs Inhibits In Vivo Transcription and Interacts with p44 Subunit of TFIIH (A) Hela cells were infected at a moi 5 pfu per cell with either RVFV ZH (open diamonds) or C13 (close diamonds) and their poly A and poly A RNA synthesis was measured at various times p.i. The curves indicate the ratio SD between values from infected and noninfected cells. (B) Luciferase (left image) or -galactosidase (right image) expression assayed in cells cotransfected with pRARE-Luc or pCMV-ßgal and pCINSsZH or pCI-NSsC13 plasmid expressing NSsZH or the deleted NSsC13 respectively, or the pCI empty plasmid as a control. The light and dark gray bars correspond to nontreated and t-RA treated cells, respectively. The values correspond to the mean of triplicate experiments SD. (C) Two hybrid screening. Yeast were transformed with pVP16-p44 expressing the activating domain of VP16 fused to the complete p44 open reading frame, together with pGBKT7, pGBKT7-NSsZH, or pGBKT7-NSsC13 expressing NSsZH or NSsC13, fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain and expression of -galactosidase was tested. The values represent at least four independent experiments with SD bars.

Results RVFV Infection Inhibits RNA Synthesis To assess the effect of RVFV infection on RNA synthesis, HeLa cells were infected with two different viruses (moi 5): the virulent strain ZH548 (ZH) (Laughlin et al., 1979), and the naturally avirulent Clone 13 (C13), containing a deleted NSs 16­198 (Muller et al., 1995). After pulse labeling with 3H-uridine, HeLa cells were collected at various times postinfection (p.i.) and their RNA content was fractionated for the presence of polyA on oligo dT beads column (Figure 1A). ZH548 caused a reduction in mRNA (poly A plus) synthesis that started at 8 hr p.i. and declined to 20% at 16 hr p.i., whereas infection with C13 did not affect mRNA synthesis (left image). We also observed that the synthesis of polyA minus RNA enriched in ribosomal rRNA was drastically inhibited in cells infected by ZH but not C13 (right image). Since the major difference between ZH and C13 resides in their NSs proteins, we next analyzed the effect of the NSs expression on inducible gene transcription. When pRARE-Luc, a reporter plasmid that expresses the luciferase under the control of the SV40 promoter and the retinoic acid responsive element (RARE), was cotransfected with pCI-NSsZH, a plasmid expressing NSsZH, the expression of luciferase was inhibited even in the presence of t-RA retinoic acid ligand (Figure 1B,

left image). Such an inhibition was not observed upon cotransfection with either pCI-NSsC13, a plasmid expressing the deleted NSsC13, or the pCI control plasmid. In all three cases, luciferase synthesis was sensitive to tRA showing that the transactivation mechanism was not affected. Similarly when the -galactosidase gene was only under the control of the CMV promoter, expression of the reporter construct was inhibited upon transfection with pCI-NSsZH but not with pCI-NSsC13 or with the empty pCI (right image). Altogether our results strongly show that RVFV-ZH infection inhibits host cell RNA synthesis. Such an inhibition occurs at the basal rather than at the activated transcription level. In addition, our transfection experiments suggest that the viral NSs protein is accountable for such an obstruction. Of note is that additional experiments indicated that NSsZH as well NSsC13 have no effect on translation when added in in vitro translation assay based on expression of capped or uncapped T7 luciferase transcripts (A.B. and M.B., unpublished data). NSs Interacts with p44, a TFIIH Subunit The above data led us to question how NSs protein would interfere with the RNA synthesis apparatus. To identify the components of the host cell that are targeted by the NSsZH protein, we set up a yeast two hybrid system in which the pGBKT7-NSs plasmid containing

the NSsZH open reading frame fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain, was used to screen a cDNA library from mouse embryo (see Experimental Procedures). Sequence analysis of one of the clones, matched with p44 cDNA (EMBL accession number AF 242432), the product of which is a subunit of TFIIH transcription factor (Endrizzi et al., 2000; Humbert et al., 1994), involved in both mRNA and rRNA synthesis (Conaway and Conaway, 1989; Gerard et al., 1991; Iben et al., 2002). With regard to the role of NSs in pathogenesis (Vialat et al., 2000; Bouloy et al., 2001) and the effect of RVFV infection on host cell transcription, the identification of an interaction with p44 appeared quite relevant. Yeast cells were transformed with pACT-p44 containing the complete p44 sequence fused to the VP16 activating domain, together with pGBKT7 plasmids containing NSsZH-, NSsC13-cDNA, or the empty plasmid. In contrast to NSsZH, we found that NSsC13 expressing NSs 16­198, does not interact with p44 (Figure 1C, compare p44/NSsC13 to p44/NSsZH). The Cellular TFIIH Concentration Decreases upon RVFV Infection We observed that RVFV infection causes a decrease of RNA synthesis and that TFIIH transcription factor is a putative target for RVFV. To further explore whether NSs affects TFIIH dependent transcription, we first investigated the composition of TFIIH subunits in HeLa cell extracts collected at various times post ZH548 infection at a moi of 10 pfu per cell. Western blot analyses using antibodies against different TFIIH subunits allowed us to assess their relative amounts in ZH548 infected nuclear extracts collected at various time p.i. (Figure 2A). These results indicate that: (1) XPB subunit concentration is unchanged until 20 hr p.i.; (2) p44 declines rapidly to a plateau of 30 to 40%; (3) whereas the other TFIIH subunits such as XPD and p62 rapidly decline below 15%. The decrease of TFIIH subunits concentration is concomitant with the appearance (between 4 and 8 hr p.i.), of the nuclear filamentous structure that contains the viral NSs protein (Figure 2A). The decrease of TFIIH content is clearly illustrated in the nuclear fraction from ZH-infected cells prepared at 20 hr p.i., which mainly contains p44 and XPB in addition to NSs (Figure 2B, lane 3), whereas C13 infected extracts contain all the subunits of TFIIH (lane 4). It is worthwhile to notice that the ratio between XPB and p44 is not the same in ZH infected extracts as in noninfected cells and in highly purified TFIIH (compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and 2, see also Figure 2A), suggesting that there are several XPB containing complexes. Ab-p44 immunoprecipitation experiments further show that ZH infected extracts contain a protein complex in which p44 is associated with XPB and NSs (Figure. 2B, lane 6). We next titrated the whole-cell extracts from ZH and C13 infected cells collected at 4 hr to 20 hr p.i., for the presence of transcription factors. To slow down the phenomenon, cells were infected at a lower moi of 2­3 pfu per cell. TBP is present in those extracts (Figure 2C, upper image). The cellular content of the p62 subunit of TFIIH decreases with time p.i. in ZH infected extracts whereas it remains constant in C13 infected ones (middle image). We then decided to quantitatively immuno-

precipitate p62 containing complexes using an excess of Ab-p62 antibodies. Western blots showed that no NSs protein was associated with the immunoprecipitated TFIIH (data not shown). When added to an in vitro transcription assay containing all the basal transcription factors (except TFIIH), RNA pol II as well as the adenovirus MLP template, all the p62-containing fractions were able to restore RNA synthesis. However, in ZH infected cells, the decrease in the synthesis of the 309 nt RNA run-off transcript parallels the amount of p62 in the WCE, whereas transcription and p62 concentration remain constant in C13-infected extracts (Figure 2C, compare lanes 2­6 with lanes 8­12). It should be pointed out that the amount of RNA transcripts from noninfected, C13, and ZH-infected cell extracts, always parallels the concentration of TFIIH. Since the specific transcriptional activity of TFIIH, evaluated as the ratio of 309 nt RNA transcripts versus p62 concentration, remains unchanged after ZH or C13 infection, and is similar to the one of the noninfected cells, we conclude that NSs does not modify the activity of TFIIH present in the infected cells but rather affects the TFIIH concentration. In contrast, the concentration and specific transcription activity of TBP, TFIIB transcription factors as well as TFIIE, which recruits TFIIH on the promoter, remain unchanged upon ZH infection (data not shown). NSs Sequesters Some of the TFIIH Subunits in Nuclear Filamentous Structures ZH infection leads to the formation of nuclear filamentous structures (Swanepoel and Blackburn, 1977), which are also observed upon pCI-NSsZH transfection (Figure 3A, a and c). Confocal microscopy also shows that the filament contains p44 and XPB subunits of TFIIH (Figure 3A, b and d and Figure 3B, a­e and f­j), which is consistent with our previous results (Figure 2). The Ab-NSs antibody stained homogenously the filament whereas the staining of p44 and XPB was more dispersed, labeling being visible in the nucleoplasm and concentrated along the filament in a punctuated pattern. p62 and p52, part of the core TFIIH (Figure 3B, k­o and data not shown), cdk7, part of the CAK subcomplex (data not shown), as well as XPD, that targets p44 (Figure 3C, a­d) failed to counterstain the nuclear filament. This strongly suggests that not all the TFIIH subunits are incorporated in these structures and/or associated with NSs. Additionally, XPD is excluded from the nucleoplasm in cells containing a nuclear filament (Figure 3C). This is particularly visible at high magnification (d) or after three-dimensional computer reconstruction; the staining with Ab-XPD forms a sort of spoon-shaped accumulation around the nuclear membrane (see e and f, the cell containing a filament). Noteworthy, according to protein fluorescent intensity measurement, we found that in cells containing the nuclear filament, XPD, p62 and p52 concentrations roughly drop to 40 to 20% of what is estimated in untransfected cells (Figure 3 and data not shown). In pCI-NSsZH transfected cells, the presence (and the concentration) of transcription factors such as TBP and DNA repair factors such as XPA, partners of TFIIH in the corresponding mechanisms, remains unchanged (Figure 3B p­t and data not shown).

TFIIH Concentration Decreases in ZH-Infected Cells (A) Quantitative analysis of TFIIH subunits and NSs analyzed by Western blot in nuclear extracts from cells infected with ZH548 at moi 5 pfu and harvested at various times p.i.

In this latter case, the curve indicates percentage of NSs amount at 12 hr postinfection (highest level).

Nuclear extracts were also immunoprecipitated with Ab-p44 and analyzed for the presence of XPB, p44, and NSs (lane 6). IIH and NSs (lanes 1 and 5) are qualitative control. L, immunoglobulin light chain. Bands without any indication are nonspecific bands. (C) Noninfected (NI) ZH and C13-infected HeLa cell extracts (moi 2­3 pfu/cell) were investigated for the presence of TBP and TFIIH (visualized by its p62 subunit), transcription factors. TFIIH was then immunoprecipitated using an excess of Ab-p62 crosslinked to agarose beads and fractions were tested in a reconstituted transcription assay lacking the TFIIH.

The Interactions of XPD and NSs with p44 Are Mutually Exclusive To investigate the interaction between NSs and subunits of TFIIH, we expressed recombinant NSs, p44, XPD, or XPB in insect cells infected with the corresponding baculoviruses (Tirode et al., 1999; Yadani et al., 1999) and after incubation of the appropriate extracts, we determined protein/protein interaction via immunoprecipitation (Figure 4). The Ab-p44 antibodies crosslinked to agarose beads coimmunoprecipitate NSs with p44, whereas in the absence of p44, NSs flows through in the supernatant (S) (Figure 4A, lanes 1­4). Following the same procedure, we found that neither XPB, a subunit of the core TFIIH subcomplex, nor XPD, the interacting

partner of p44 within TFIIH (Coin et al., 1998) are able to coimmunoprecipitate NSs (lane 6­9 and 10­13). However, NSs coimmunoprecipitates with XPB, once p44 is present (lane 14­15). This is not surprising since XPB interacts with p44 (our unpublished data) and is found in the filamentous structure (Figure 3). Confocal microscopy revealed that XPD is not present in the filamentous structure and seems to be excluded from the nucleus. XPD has no nuclear localization signal and probably depends on p44 for nuclear entry (Santagati et al., 2001). Thus, we investigated whether the interactions of XPD and NSs with p44 are mutually exclusive. Recombinant p44 was first incubated with an excess of XPD (1st inc), before immunoprecipitation with

NSs Protein Does Not Interact with Mature TFIIH (A) Baculoviruses infected insect cell lysates containing p44, XPB, XPD, or NSs proteins were mixed as indicated at the top of each image, and immunoprecipitated with Ab-p44 (lanes 1­4), Ab-XPB (lanes 6­9 and 14­15), or Ab-XPD (lanes 10­13) antibodies crosslinked to agarose beads.

Ab-p44 immunoprecipitates and supernatant fraction were next analyzed by Western blot for the presence of XPD, NSs, and p44.

Ab-p44 (Figure 4B). After 0.15 M KCl washing, the immobilized p44/XPD complexes were further incubated with an excess of NSs protein for 2 hr (2nd inc). In a parallel experiment, p44 was initially incubated with NSs and p44/NSs immunoprecipitated complexes were further incubated with XPD for 2 hr. After centrifugation and washing, both immunoprecipitated fractions were analyzed by Western blot (Figure 4B, lanes 1 and 2). In those conditions, neither NSs nor XPD were able to substitute for the first partner of p44 (compare lanes 1­2 with lanes 3­4). We however noticed that NSs/p44 interaction seems weaker than XPD/p44 interaction; NSs is partially released following the 0.15 M KCl wash (lane 4), whereas XPD/p44 could be disrupted starting at 0.8 M KCl concentration (Reardon et al., 1996; Rossignol et al., 1997). According to the above data, we checked whether NSs would interact with the entire TFIIH. Recombinant TFIIH produced in insect cells, was immunoprecipitated using Ab-p62 antibodies crosslinked to agarose beads and further incubated for 2 hr with NSs. After extensive washing, TFIIH was unable to retain NSs that flows through in the supernatant (Figure 4C, lanes 1­4). We also demonstrated that incubation of NSs with TFIIH does not modify its transcriptional activity (lanes 7­10). Altogether our data indicate that NSs is unable to interact with p44 when already associated with XPD

within TFIIH, making it unlikely that it provokes its dissociation. We also show that the interactions of XPD and NSs with p44 are mutually exclusive, suggesting that NSs likely blocks the assembly of TFIIH. Discussion Inhibition of host RNA synthesis is a prominent feature of infection with cytopathic RNA viruses like poliovirus or vesicular stomatitis virus (Baltimore and Franklin, 1962; Zimmerman et al., 1963). The mechanisms of inhibition have been difficult to elucidate because viral proteins are notoriously broad in affecting cellular function (Lyles, 2000). The present study demonstrates that the virulent strain ZH548 of the Rift Valley hemorrhagic fever virus inhibits cellular RNA synthesis and that the phenomenon is due to its nonstructural NSs protein that targets TFIIH dependent transcription. The RVFV NSs Protein Targets TFIIH-DependentTranscription Upon infection with the virulent RVFV ZH548 expressing NSs, time course experiments demonstrate that both poly-A plus and poly-A minus RNA synthesis decrease as a function of time p.i. Such a decrease is due to the viral protein NSs as: (1) the avirulent RVFV C13, which

P44 of TFIIH Interacts with RVFV NSs Protein 547

expresses a deleted form of the nonstructural NSs protein, does not significantly affect transcription (Figure 1A), and (2) transfection experiments in human cells demonstrates the role of the viral NSs protein in the inhibition of RNA synthesis (Figure 1B). RVFV NSs activity is mediated through the TFIIH transcription factor: (1) a yeast two hybrid screening, identifies p44 subunit of the TFIIH transcription factor, as a target for NSs (Figure 1C); (2) in infected cell extracts, NSs interacts with p44 in a complex that also contains XPB subunit of TFIIH (Figure 2B). Such an interaction was also visualized using recombinant proteins (Figure 4A); (3) confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that the filamentous nuclear structures resulting from RVFV infection, contains not only NSs but also the p44 and XPB subunits of TFIIH (Figure 3). How can we relate the ability of NSs to target the p44 subunit of the TFIIH transcription factor and the RNA synthesis inhibition observed upon RVFV-ZH infection? One possibility would be to suggest that NSs inhibits the activity of TFIIH. This seems unlikely, since we found that the specific TFIIH transcriptional activity, evaluated as the ratio between RNA transcripts and TFIIH content, remained unchanged until 20 hr after RVFV ZH548 infection (Figure 2C), a period representing the complete replicative cycle. We also showed that NSs was unable to inhibit TFIIH activity when added in a reconstituted in vitro transcription assay (Figure 4C). We thus conclude that NSs neither modifies the transcriptional activity of the multisubunit TFIIH nor dissociates the entire TFIIH. We rather favor the following hypothesis in which the RNA synthesis inhibition observed in RVFV ZH548infected cells, results from a dramatic decrease of the cellular TFIIH concentration. This is in agreement with both the Western blot analysis (Figure 2) and confocal microscopy images (Figure 3). In this case, RNA synthesis diminishes because TFIIH becomes the limiting factor for the transcription reaction. Indeed, a time course experiment demonstrates that upon RVFV infection, changes in the stoichiometry of TFIIH subunits parallel the synthesis of the NSs protein and the formation of the nuclear filament (Figures 2 and 3). For example, by 8 hr p.i., most of the TFIIH subunits including p52, p62, and XPD have disappeared in the nuclear extracts (Figure 2A). At 20 hr p.i., nuclear extracts mainly contain p44 and XPB subunits that can be immunoprecipitated with NSs (Figure 2B). It is clear that NSs plays the major role for this phenomenon: when cells were infected with the naturally avirulent Clone C13, containing a deleted NSs 16­198, although the virus replicates and synthesizes its own proteins (Muller et al., 1995), we observed neither a decrease in TFIIH concentration (Figure 2B, lane 2­4) nor RNA synthesis inhibition (Figure 2C, lanes 7­12), strongly suggesting that basal transcription machinery is not affected by the other viral proteins. It is likely that sequestration of p44 and XPB by the viral NSs protein within the nuclear filament limits the quantity of TFIIH that can be assembled and perhaps enhances the turnover of the other subunits due to their nonincorporation in the TFIIH complexes. With regard to the inhibition of TFIIH formation, another argument is that the interactions of NSs and XPD with p44 are mutually exclusive (Figure 4B). This could also explain

why ZH548-infected cells exhibit an abnormal accumulation of the XPD subunit around the nuclear membrane. It was suggested that the nuclear entry of XPD, which lacks a nuclear localization signal (NLS), is mediated by one of the other components of TFIIH such as p44, its interacting partner (Santagati et al., 2001). In such a case, upon RVFV infection, NSs that lacks a NLS (Yadani et al., 1999), binds to p44 to be transported to the nucleus leading to the formation of the nuclear filament whereas XPD accumulates in the cytoplasm. Knowing that XPD/p44 interaction is stronger than the NSs/p44 one, it also seems likely that NSs takes the advantage in binding because it is in large excess compared to p44. However, TFIIH may dissociate into subcomplexes (Drapkin et al., 1996; Rossignol et al., 1997) or in separate subunits after transcriptional initiation. In such a case indeed, in infected cells, NSs might interact with either p44 or the core of TFIIH (that contains XPB, p62, p52, p44, and p34), thus preventing the reassembly of the TFIIH subunits. We did not favor this hypothesis, since we have never found free TFIIH subunits in our uninfected cell extracts. Moreover, NSs is unable to target p44 when present in the core TFIIH (S.D., L.P.D.S., and N.L.M., unpublished data). We thus can propose that upon viral infection, NSs might prevent the assembly of either newly synthesized TFIIH and/or of the recycled TFIIH subcomplexes. The Viral Pathogenesis To evade the host response, RVFV "has chosen" to prevent the formation of the multisubunit TFIIH transcription factor, the requirement of which is crucial for transcription. It therefore seems logical to assume that the inhibition of cellular transcription is responsible for the toxic effect on the cells. One might expect that the inhibition of transcription and subsequent gene expression are not compatible with cell survival and lead to cell death. A key feature of RVFV in pathogenesis is the antiviral response due to type I interferon (Bouloy et al., 2001; Vialat et al., 2000). In this fight for supremacy, the issue of the war between the cell and the virus depends on the viral load and the rapidity of the cellular response. Indeed, we have recently found that NSs subverts the IFN production at the level of transcription in ZH548 but not in C13-infected cells where IFN mRNA is synthesized as early as 3­6 hr (Billecocq et al., 2003). It is reasonable to consider that NSs inhibits the antiviral response through the inhibition of host gene transcription and TFIIH targeting. Indeed, in cells infected at a high moi, NSs targets p44, thus inducing a rapid decrease of the cellular TFIIH concentration (see Figure 2C, at 4 hr, there are less than 50% of TFIIH). Likewise, the transcription inhibition might explain, at least in part, other features of the RVFV pathogenesis in intact animals such as the extremely rapid death and superacute hepatitis of newborn animals, the growth of which are highly dependent on the expression of hormone-regulated genes. It has been demonstrated that NSs of the orthobunyavirus Bunyamwera is responsible for pathogenicity (Bridgen et al., 2001); in infected cells, NSs inhibits IFN transcription (Weber et al., 2002) and the phosphoryla-

Cell 548

tion of the C-terminal domain of RNA pol II is deficient (Thomas et al., 2003). This observation is coherent with our results. Indeed to be active (in the elongating form), RNA pol II requires accurate phosphorylation (Dahmus and Dynan, 1992). To be phosphorylated, RNA pol II needs TFIIH (Lu et al., 1992; Roy et al., 1994). However it should be remembered that TFIIH has some other roles in the cell (Frit et al., 1999). As TFIIH becomes a limiting factor, much less RNA pol II is phosphorylated in infected cells. One should however, wonder if RVFV gets a benefit from this situation. Indeed, RVFV replicates in the presence of actinomycin D (Bishop, 1996), an inhibitor of host cell transcription machinery. Nevertheless, it utilizes capped oligonucleotides derived from cellular mRNA to prime synthesis of its own mRNA (Schmaljohn and Hooper, 2001). Early in infection when the virus needs RNA primers for its own transcription, cytoplasmic cellular mRNAs are still available but later they must be in limiting amounts because of the strong mRNA synthesis inhibition. The lack of primers might help to switch to the synthesis of uncapped antigenomes and contribute to a certain extent to the regulation of viral transcription and replication. In other words, one could emphasize the following scenario in which the TFIIH concentration will orchestrate the balance between host cell transcription and viral replication. It remains that the mechanism of inactivation of TFIIH is of considerable interest not only because its implication for viral pathogenesis but also because it provides information about the regulation of this factor at the crossroads of several mechanisms implied in gene expression. The understanding of such a complex network of virus-host interactions and the cellular antiviral process should help in identifying targets for therapeutic intervention.
Experimental Procedures Plasmids The cDNAs coding for NSs of ZH and C13 RVFV strain were synthesized by RT-PCR and cloned between the unique NheI and KpnI sites of pCI plasmid (Promega) or in the BamHI site of pGBKT7 plasmid (Clontech). All the constructs were sequenced using the ABI PRISM Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit. The pRARE-Luc and pCMV- Gal plasmids were as described (Keriel et al., 2002; Marie et al., 1998).

was also used to assess interaction by cotransformation with pGBKT7-NSs. Viruses and Cells Stocks of RVFV ZH548 and clone 13 (Laughlin et al., 1979; Muller et al., 1995) were produced under BSL3 conditions by infecting vero cells at 10 3 moi and by harvesting at 72 hr p.i. HeLa and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 20 U/ml penicillin, and 20 g/ml streptomycin. Determination of RNA Synthesis For RNA measurement, HeLa cells noninfected or infected by ZH or C13 at the moi 5 were pulse labeled with 20 Ci per ml of 5-3H-uridine (Amersham) for 60 min at 3, 5, 7, 15, or 19 hr p.i. Cells were collected and then suspended in lysis buffer containing 100 g/ l proteinase K, RNA extracted and fractionated on oligo-dT beads (Kit GenElute Direct mRNA Kit, Promega). Poly A( ) and ( ) RNAs were precipitated by 10% of trichloroacetic acid and filtered onto glass fiber discs (Whatman). The radioactivity from samples carried out in triplicate was counted. Luciferase Assay HeLa cells were transfected using Effectene reagent (QIAGEN) with 500 ng of reporter gene (pRARE-Luc), 100 ng of pCMV-LacZ vector, and transfected together with 10 ng of pCI, pCI-NSsZH, or pCI-NSsC13. At 16 hr posttransfection, the cells were treated with 10 6 M all t-RA for 24 hr in a medium without red phenol and containing 10% of charcoal-treated FCS. Luciferase activity was determined using a Microlumat FB12 luminometer (EG&G, Berthold, Germany). Interaction Assays XPB, XPD, p44 (Tirode et al., 1999), and NSs (Yadani et al., 1999) proteins were expressed in H5 insect cells infected with the corresponding baculoviruses. Cell extracts were prepared by homogenizing in 50 mM Tris/HCl [pH 7.9], 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 protease cocktail inhibitor, and clarification by centrifugation (15000 rpm, 1 hr) at 4 C. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using Ab-XPB (1B3), Ab-XPD (2F6), and Ab-p44 (1H5) crosslinked to protein A-agarose beads in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl [pH 7.9], 10% glycerol, 150 mM KCl, 0.1% nonidet P40, for 2 hr at room temperature. Agarose beads were washed with the same buffer and the immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved in SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting. Preparation of Cellular Extracts To analyze the fate of TFIIH subunits (Figures 2A and 2B), nuclear extracts were prepared using a protocol modified from (He et al., 2000). HeLa cells infected at a moi of 5 pfu with ZH548 or C13 or noninfected were harvested at the indicated time and lysed in CSK buffer (10 mM Pipes [pH 6.8], 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail, and 0.5% Triton X100) at 4 C for 5 min. After centrifugation at 2000 g, the cytoplasmic fraction was removed. The nuclear pellet was treated with DNase I at 37 C for 15 min and solubilized in 8 M urea containing buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 100 mM Na H2PO4). After Western blotting, the intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometry using the Fluor-S(TM)-MultiImager (BioRad). For immunoprecipitations, the DNase-treated nuclei were swollen in 5 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.6] at 37 C for 30 min, adjusted to a final concentration of 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X100, and sonicated. Insoluble material was eliminated by centrifugation at 1600 g for 3 min. For transcription assays and Western blot analysis (Figure 2C), HeLa cell infected at a moi of 2­3 with RVFV ZH548 or C13 or noninfected were washed with PBS and harvested at various time p.i., lysed in 20 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.5], 600 mM KCl, and 2 mM EDTA containing 0.5% NP40. The whole-cell extract was recovered as the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 30 min. In Vitro Transcription Assays Run-off transcription assays were performed using the adenovirus major late promoter template, the recombinant TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF,

cDNA Library Screening A mouse 17 day embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH) pretransformed in Y187 strain was used for screening by mating with yeast AH109 transformed by pGBKT7-NSs. S. cerevisiae AH109 strain (MATa, trp1, his3, ade2, leu2, LYS2::(Gal1UAS TATA)-HIS3, URA3::(MEL1UAS TATA)-lacZ/MEL1) and Y187 strain (MAT , trp1, leu2, URA3:: (Gal1UAS TATA)-lacZ/MEL1) were used. Yeast were grown on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (SD medium) containing 5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a suppressor of unspecific HIS3 expression. Among 8 106 diploid clones screened, approximately 400 colonies grew after 8­10 days in the selecting medium lacking histidine indicating that they activated the reporter HIS3 gene and 250 of them were found to activate the second reporter gene LacZ. Overlay and liquid -Gal assays were performed. The pACT-p44 plasmid expressing p44 (from amino acid 1­184) was rescued after transformation in bacteria and the insert sequenced and analyzed with the BLAST computer program. pVP16-p44 containing the VP16 activation domain fused to the entire p44 ORF

TBP transcription factors, and the partially purified HeLa RNA pol II as described (Gerard et al., 1991). Aliquots of TFIIH immunoprecipitated fraction from infected/noninfected cells were added to the reaction. Confocal Microscopy ZH548-RVFV-infected or pCI-NSsZH-transfected cells were growth in Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, USA), fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde at RT and permeabilized by PBS/0.5% Triton during 5 min. Slides were washed in PBS-Tween20, blocked for 1 hr in PBS-Tween/0.5% NFDM and incubated for 1 hr with the primary antibody [mouse monoclonal antibodies: Ab-NSs (NSP31, kindly provided by J. Smith), Ab-p52 (1D11), Ab-p62 (3C9), Ab-XPD (2F6), Ab-TBP (3G3), Ab-XPA (1E11); polyclonal antibodies: goat/ Ab-p44 (N-17) and rabbit/Ab-XPB (S-19), from Santa Cruz, USA)] diluted 1:500 in PBS-Tween/0.5% NFDM. After washing, the slides were incubated for 1 hr with donkey antimouse IgG-FITC conjugated and/or donkey antirabbit IgG-Cy3 conjugated and/or donkey antigoat IgG-Cy3 conjugated (Jackson laboratories, USA) diluted 1:400 in PBS-Tween/0.5% NFDM. Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (0.2 g/ml prepared in Vectashield mounting medium; Vector Lab, USA). All images were collected using a Leica confocal SP1 microscope equipped with both UV laser and an Argon/Krypton laser, and prism spectrophotometer system to allow collection of the data at 488 and 568 nm. Software TCSTK, developed by our imaging IGBMC facility, was used for analyzing three-color images and calculating three-dimensional reconstructions.
