Abstract CRNP5, a variant of Borna disease virus (BDV), has stronger pathogenesis in rats than the related variant CRP3, although only 4 amino acids in the whole genome are different. As a first step to clarify the differential pathogenesis between the variants, the present study focused on examining the expression of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-b family in the brain of rats infected with BDV. The main results were as follows. (1) BDV infection, irrespective of the variant, up-regulates TGF-b1 expression in the brain, (2) the expressions of signal receptors for TGF-b1 are also increased, (3) the expression of brain inhibin/activin bE is up-regulated by BDV infection, and (4) the expression of brain inhibin/activin bC tends to be higher in rats exhibiting severe Borna disease. These results indicate that members of the TGF-b family are involved in neuronal disorders induced by BDV infection in a ligand-dependent manner. In particular, up-regulation of inhibin/activin bC may be a key event responsible for induction of the stronger pathogenesis of the CRNP5 variant of BDV. Ó 2009 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

1. Introduction Borna disease virus (BDV) is a nonsegmented negativestrand RNA virus [1] belonging to the family Bornaviridae [1]. BDV naturally infects a wide range of warm-blooded hosts [2]. In horses and sheep, BDV causes classical Borna disease (BD), a fatal mononuclear inflammatory encephalomyelitis with severe signs of neurological disease, including behavioral abnormalities [2]. Responses to BDV infection vary according to differences in the species, animal strain or age of the host at

the time of infection [3], indicating that host-dependent factors determine the onset of BD. The severity of neurological disorders is, however, also affected by virus-specific factors. Inoculation of a BDV variant, CRNP5, to neonatal as well as adult rats rapidly induced severe neurological disorders, as compared with inoculation of another variant, CRP3 [4]; CRNP5 was produced after two serial passages in rat brain (CRP2) followed by five serial passages in mouse brain, while the CRP3 variant underwent a single brain passage in rats beyond CRP2 [4]. Comparison of the whole genome sequence of CRP3 with CRNP5 indicated differences of only four nucleotides, with the replacement of encoding amino acids; two for membrane glycoprotein (F458S and Y480H) and two for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L polymerase) (K1417R and G1686R) [4]. Thus, single or multiple nucleotide substitutions of CRP3 are

crucial to determine the severity of neurological disorders in rats; however, the reason for the differential pathogenesis between the two related BDV variants is not known at the molecular level, although mutations of L polymerase were recently reported to enhance virus replication in mice through an increase in enzymatic activity [5]. The onset of BD results from the functional alteration of neurons as well as resident cells of the central nervous system through the expression of cytokines. Previous studies have shown that the expressions of interleukin (IL)-1a,-2 and-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and interferon (IFN)-g were up-regulated in the brain of adult rats infected with BDV [6,7]. In addition to these inflammatory cytokines, the increased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 in the brain was also evident in neonatal rats infected with BDV [8]. Irrespective of the lack of infiltration of immune cells into the brain resulting from the immature immune system, BDVinfected neonatal rats exhibited behavioral abnormalities [9]. Thus, the induction of brain TGF-b1 suggests intrinsic effects of BDV infection. Altered expression of TGF-b is suggested to associate with the onset of various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease [10]. In addition, the infusion of activin, another member of the TGF-b family, into the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus produced an antidepressant-like effect in a behavioral model of depression [11]. Therefore, members of the TGF-b family may be involved in the determination of pathogenesis and behavioral abnormalities induced by BDV infection. As a first step to clarify the molecular basis for the differential pathogenesis between CRP3 and CRNP5 in rats, the present study examines the gene expression of members of the TGF-b family in the brain of rats infected with BDV at three weeks of age. In addition, expression of the signal components, receptors and signal mediators, was also examined. 2. Methods 2.1. Virus and infection BDV variants, CRP3 and CRNP5, were produced from BDV-infected MDCK cells, as described previously [4,12]. Briefly, CRP1 was defined as a BDV variant recovered from rat brain infected with BDV-infected MDCK cells. CRNP5 was produced after two serial passages in rat brain (CRP2) followed by five serial passages in mouse brain (a total of seven passages in brain), while CRP3 underwent a single brain passage in rats beyond CRP2 (a total of three passages in brain). Three-week-old male F344 rats (CLEA Japan) were intracranially inoculated with 2 Â 103 FFU of CRP3 or CRNP5, or with an equal volume of uninfected mouse brain materials (day 0). In this study, we used F344 rats; responses to BDV infection in F344 rats have been reported to be as high as those in Lewis rats [13], although the pathogenesis of CRNP5 is not known. Virus titer was determined by indirect immunofluorescent assays using C6 rat glioma cells, as described previously [4]. Rats were scored for the incidence

and severity of BD every 4 days. The disease severity of the infected rats was ranked on a score of 0e3 as follows: 0, no disease; 1, early evidence of disease, e.g., lack of grooming or increased activity; 2, signs of neurological disease, e.g., hyperactivity, ataxia, or paresis with mobility, with rats eating and hydrated; 3, severe disease, e.g., total or near total paralysis, severe dehydration, and moribund state. Rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia at 56 days post-infection (dpi) or the following day when judged as score 3. Gene expression of the TGF-b family, inflammatory cytokines and iNOS was examined in the brain by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). All rat experiments were approved by the Azabu University Animal Experiment Committee (No. 53). 2.2. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was isolated from homogenates of the left hemisphere of the brain using an RNA isolation kit (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen). The cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR were performed as described previously [14]. The primers for qRTPCR are shown in Table 1. 2.3. Statistical analyses Data are expressed as the mean Æ SEM. Data were analyzed by one-way of analysis of variance. When the effect of treatment, i.e., the inoculated BDV variant, was significant (P < 0.05), differences between treatments were examined by Student's t-test. Differences of P < 0.05 were considered significant. 3. Results Rats infected with CRNP5 severely exhibited BD (Fig. 1). All infected rats, except for one rat that exhibited score 2 from 16 dpi to 56 dpi, infected with CRNP5 were judged as score 3 within 20e28 dpi. By contrast, rats infected with CRP3 exhibited slower and milder disease on behavioral criteria (Fig. 1), and score 3 was not recorded. These results were consistent with a previous study using adult Lewis rats [4], although the onset of BD in CRNP5-infected F344 rats tended to be slower (w 2 wk) and extent of BD in CRP3-infected F344 rats was milder. No clinical abnormalities were evident in control rats throughout the study. Pathological analyses revealed that a nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis developed both in rats infected with CRP3 and in those infected with CRNP5, and that the encephalic reaction and perivascular infiltration were severer in rats infected with CRNP5 than in those infected with CRP3 (data not shown). Consistent with the pathological results and the previous results [6,7], expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a and INF-g) as well as a related molecule (iNOS) that correlated to the degree of inflammation [15] were significantly increased in BDV-infected rats, although statistical analyses could not be done for INF-g due to the expression beneath detection limits in control rats

(Fig. 2). In addition, expression of IL-1b, IL-6 and iNOS but not IFN-g was higher in rats infected with CRNP5 than in those infected with CRP3. Although expression level of TNFa tended to be higher in CRNP5-infected rats, it was statistically insignificant, resulting from relatively large individual variations. The expressions of TGF-b family members, their receptors and signal mediator Smads in BDV-infected brains were examined by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3e5). More than 40 members of the TGF-b family were divided into three subgroups; TGF-bs, inhibins/activins and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). In this study, we examined the expressions of representative ligands of the subgroups. In addition, the expression of growth differentiation factor (GDF) 15 was evaluated, because it is

strongly expressed in the epithelium of the choroid plexus in the brain [16]. As for TGF-b family ligands, genes of which expression levels changed more than 2-fold in BDV-infected rats as compared with control rats were inhibin/activin bC and bE, and TGF-b1 (Fig. 3). Although statistically insignificant, the expression of inhibin/activin bC increased w4.3-fold in rats infected with CRNP5 (P ¼ 0.06) but not with CRP3. In addition, inhibin/activin bE expression was up-regulated w4.9-fold in the brain of rats infected with CRNP5. CRP3 infection also increased the expression, but the effect was slightly smaller (w3.7-fold increase). Comparable gene induction of TGF-b1 was detected between CRP3-infected and CRNP5-infected rats. Although the expressions of inhibin

Threeweek-old male F344 rats were intracranially inoculated with CRP3 variant (n ¼ 9) or CRNP5 variant (n ¼ 9) of BDV, or with uninfected mouse brain materials (control, n ¼ 11). Severity of Borna disease was scored as 0e3. The day after assessment with score 3, rats were sacrificed. Data are presented as the means with SEM; once rats were judged as score 3, they were calculated as score 3 throughout the remaining study, even if they were sacrificed.

a, inhibin/activin bA, TGF-b2, BMP-2, and GDF-15 were statistically different among treatments, the extent was smaller. The current signaling model indicates that the members transmit signals through a ligand-specific heteromeric receptor, consisting of type I and type II receptors, which are receptor serine/threonine kinases that in turn phosphorylate and activate receptor-regulated (R)-Smad, leading to complex formation with common partner (Co)-Smad, Smad4, and transcriptional regulation of the target genes [17]. R-Smad is categorized into two subclasses: activin/TGF-b pathwayspecific R-Smad (AR-Smad, Smad2 and 3), and BMP pathway-specific R-Smad (BR-Smad, Smad1, 5 and 8) [17].

As for type I and type II receptors, ALK5 and TbRII genes, signal receptors for TGF-b[17], changed substantially (>2fold) among treatments (Fig. 4). The expression of ALK5 was up-regulated in the BDV-infected brain, and higher expression was detected in the brain of rats infected with CRP3 (Fig. 4A). By contrast, TbRII expression was increased in the BDVinfected brain, irrespective of the variant (Fig. 4B). Statistical differences among treatments were detected in the expressions of ALK1, ActRIIA and BMPRII, but the extent of the differences was smaller. As compared to the gene induction of ligands and receptors, changes in the expression level of Smads in response to the BDV infection was relatively smaller (<2-fold) (Fig. 5). The effect of treatments was statistically significant in the expression level of all examined Smads, probably resulting from less variation of the expression between rats. Thus, a relatively smaller effect of BDV infection could be detected. Generally, BDV infection increased the expression of Smad, although no statistically significant differences were detected in Smad2/3/5/7 expression between control and CRNP5infected rats. 4.

The severity of neurological disorders resulting from BDV infection depends on not only the host factors, including species and age related to development of the immune system [3], but also virus factors; CRNP5 variant of BDV had more potent pathogenesis not only in neonatal rats but also in adult rats than CRP3 variant [4]. As a first step to explore the (1) role of cytokines, especially the TGF-b family, in the onset of BD, and (2) reason for the differential pathogenesis between CRP3 and CRNP5 at the molecular level, the present study examined gene expressions of signaling components of the TGF-b family in the brain of rats infected with the BDV

Three-week-old male F344 rats were intracranially inoculated with CRP3 variant (n ¼ 9) or CRNP5 variant (n ¼ 9) of BDV, or with uninfected mouse brain materials (control, n ¼ 11). Expressions of type I receptors (A) and type II receptors (B) of the TGF-b family were measured by qRT-PCR, and expressed as ratios to G3PDH, with the level in control brains set to 1. *P < 0.05 (vs. control group), and yP < 0.05 (vs. CRP3).

variant. Here we reveal that (1) BDV infection, irrespective of the variant, up-regulates the expression of TGF-b1 in the rat brain, (2) the expression of signal receptors for TGF-b1 is also increased, (3) the expression of brain inhibin/activin bE is upregulated by BDV infection, and (4) the expression of inhibin/ activin bC in the brain tends to be higher in rats exhibiting severe BD. These results suggest that members of the TGF-b family are involved in neuronal disorders induced by BDV infection in a ligand-dependent manner. Consistent with previous studies using neonatal rats with an immature immune system [8,18], the increased expression of TGF-b1, but not TGF-b2 and TGF-b3, was evident in the brain of rats infected with CRP3. In the present study, the comparable up-regulation of TGF-b1 was also detected in CRNP5-infected rats. In view of the simultaneous up-regulation of ALK5 and TbRII in the brain of rats infected with BDV, accelerated TGF-b signaling may be related to the onset of BDV-induced neurological disorders; however, the lack of significant differences in the expression levels between CRP3

and CRNP5 suggests that TGF-b1 is not the causal molecule responsible for determining the severity of BD. Severe meningoencephalitis was detected in brains infected with CRP3 or CRNP5 (data not shown), which was supported by expression of inflammatory cytokines and a related molecule (Fig. 2). In view of a close relationship between expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b and TNF-a and that of TGF-b1 in the central nervous system [19], IL-1b and TNF-a produced by the infiltrated cells may be a trigger to acceleration of TGF-b1 signaling. Because TGF-b is known to act as an immune suppressor [20], increased expression of TGF-b1 and the receptors may reflect negative feedback. In fact, intraperitoneal injection of TGF-b2 ameliorated extent of BD in rats [21]. At the onset of severe BD, the encephalitis was milder in adult Lewis rats infected with CRNP5 than in those infected with CRP3 [4], which was inconsistent with the present results. Although the reason should be clarified in future studies, the slower development of severe BD in adult F344 rats (w2 wk) may be related with the degree of meningoencephalitis. In addition to TGF-b1 expression, the expression of inhibin/activin bE was increased in BDV-infected rats, irrespective of the variant. This suggests the involvement of this growth/differentiation factor in BDV infection-related neurological disturbances. By contrast, the expression of inhibin/ activin bC tended to be higher in the brain infected with CRNP5 than with CRP3 (P ¼ 0.06), which is related to the severity of BD. The reason why only 4 amino acid differences between CRP3 and CRNP5 differentially regulated inhibin/ activin bC expression is not currently known. The gene induction of inhibin/activin bC may be a key event eliciting stronger pathogenesis of CRNP5, although the up-regulation is likely to outcome of severe BD. At present, the regulatory expression, biological functions and signaling cascade of inhibin/activin bC and bE have not been fully elucidated. Signal receptors and Smads mediated inhibin/activin bC and bE are still unknown, although structurally related activin A, a homodimer of inhibin/activin bA, signals via ALK4 and ActRIIA/IIB, and Smad2/3 [17]. Inhibin/activin bC and bE are predominantly expressed in the

liver [22,23], but they are also minimally expressed in other tissues. The expressions of inhibin/activin bE and bC were significantly increased, and tended to increase, respectively, in the lung after antigen-induced airway inflammation [24]; however, detailed regulation at the molecular level is unclear. In addition, transgenic mice expressing human inhibin/activin bE using b-actin promoter exhibited a smaller pancreas related to the replacement of pancreatic acinar cells with adipocytes [25], although targeted disruption of inhibin/activin bC or bE, or both showed no apparent effect on embryonic development or liver function [26]. Furthermore, inhibin/activin bC was suggested to regulate the level of activin A through the formation of activin AC [27]; however, the activin isoform has not been purified from natural sources, including tissues and cultured cells. Recently, it was reported that transgenic mice in which activin was overexpressed in a forebrain-specific manner exhibited reduced anxiety-related behavior [28]. This indicates a direct relationship between activin and higher brain function, which may give a hint for molecular mechanism of BDVinduced behavioral abnormalities. Further detailed studies are required to clarify several points, including localization in the brain, transcriptional control, complex composition, and the signal transduction of inhibin/activin bC and bE. The present results are an interesting first step to explore a novel link between behavioral disorders resulting from BDV infection and the TGF-b family.
