Ê The 2.2 A crystalline structure of an oxidized active-site variant of Escherichia coli thioredoxin (Trx) has been solved. Trx is a 12 kDa enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of dithiols and the reduction and isomerization of disul®des in other proteins. Its active site contains the common structural motif CXXC. Protein-disul®de isomerase (PDI), a 57 kDa homolog of Trx, contains four Trx-like domains. The threedimensional structure of PDI is unknown. PDI-de®cient Saccharomyces cerevisiae are inviable. An active-site variant of Trx which complements PDI-de®cient yeast has the activesite sequence Cys32-Val33-Trp34-Cys35 (CVWC). The reduction potential of oxidized CVWC Trx (EH = À0.230 V) is altered signi®cantly from that of the wild-type enzyme (EH = À0.270 V). However, the structure of the oxidized CVWC enzyme is almost identical to that of wild-type Trx. The addition of valine and tryptophan in the active site is likely to increase the reduction potential, largely by decreasing the pKa of the Cys32 thiol in the reduced enzyme. Unlike in wild-type Trx, signi®cant protein±protein contacts occur in the crystal. Protein molecules related by a crystallographic twofold axis form a dimer in the crystal. The dimer forms as an extension of the twisted mixed -sheet which composes the backbone of each Trx structure.

1. Introduction
Escherichia coli thioredoxin (Trx), a thiol±disul®de oxidoreductase, catalyzes the oxidation of dithiols and the reduction and isomerization of disul®des in other proteins (Gilbert, 1990). Trx is an 11.7 kDa enzyme with a polypeptide chain of 108 amino-acid residues. The structure of Trx, as described by X-ray crystallography (Holmgren et al., 1975; Katti et al., 1990) and NMR spectroscopy (Jeng et al., 1994), is comprised of a ®ve-stranded -sheet containing parallel and antiparallel strands, surrounded by four -helices. The active site is located at the N-terminus of an -helix near the central portion of the -sheet (residues 32±49). The active-site sequence, Cys-GlyPro-Cys (CGPC), is conserved among thioredoxins and is characteristic of the CXXC motif of thiol±disul®de oxidoÊ reductases (Chivers et al., 1998; Aslund & Beckwith, 1999). Catalysis of disul®de-bond reduction or isomerization by Trx is initiated by deprotonation of the solvent-exposed N-terminal CXXC cysteine residue (Cys32) to form a thiolate. The reaction proceeds by nucleophilic attack of this thiolate on the substrate. To achieve maximal catalysis, the pKa of the thiol must match the ambient pH (Gilbert, 1990). Generally, the pKa of a cysteine thiol is near 9 and thus would be mostly protonated and unreactive at physiological pH. However, Cys32 has a microscopic pKa near 7 (Chivers, Prehoda,

Volkman et al., 1997). Nucleophilic attack by Cys32 results in the formation of an enzyme±substrate mixed disul®de. Cys35 is buried in the protein structure and has a pKa near 11 (LeMaster, 1996; Chivers, Prehoda & Raines, 1997). General base catalysis by Asp26 enables Cys35 to attack Cys32, producing reduced substrate and oxidized Trx (Chivers & Raines, 1997; LeMaster et al., 1997). Another important feature of a CXXC motif is the reduction potential of its disul®de bond. Trx is the most reducing of the known thiol±disul®de oxidoreductases, having a reduction potential (EH ) of À0.270 V (Moore et al., 1964). Proteindisul®de isomerase (PDI), a homologous enzyme, has a È reduction potential of EH = À0.180 V (Lundstrom & Holmgren, 1993). PDI is a 55 kDa enzyme which consists of domains a, b, bH , aH and c (Edman et al., 1985; Pihlajaniemi et al., 1987; Kemmink et al., 1996). The a and aH domains of PDI are structurally homologous to Trx and contain active sites of sequence Cys-Gly-His-Cys (CGHC) (Kemmink et al., 1996). The b and bH domains are homologous to Trx but do not contain CXXC active sites (Kemmink et al., 1997). The c domain is not critical for enzyme function (Koivunen et al., 1999). No three-dimensional structure has been reported for the intact enzyme. PDI is found in a variety of organisms, has been described as a chaperone and is the most ef®cient known catalyst of oxidative protein folding (Freedman, 1989; Noiva & Lennarz, 1992). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the essential function of PDI is to catalyze the isomerization of non-native Á disul®de bonds to native ones (Laboissiere et al., 1995). The active-site sequences of PDI and Trx play a role in dictating the reduction potential, but are not the only determinants. Krause et al. (1991) introduced the PDI active-site sequence into Trx and determined the reduction potential (EH = À0.235 V). The remaining difference in reduction potential between PDI and CGHC Trx (ÁEH = 0.055 V) represents nearly a 100-fold difference in the equilibrium stability of the CXXC disul®de bond. Chivers et al. (1996) selected for random mutations in the CXXC motif of Trx which would complement PDI-de®cient yeast. Two such sequences, Cys-Val-Trp-Cys (CVWC; EH = À0.230 V) and Cys-Gly-Trp-Cys (CGWC; EH = À0.200 V), were found to do so. The ability to replace PDI arises from the increased thiolate concentration of the variant CXXC motifs. Here, we report the crystalline structure of the oxidized Ê CVWC variant of Trx re®ned to a resolution of 2.2 A. The structure reveals that the substitutions cause few changes in the conformation of the protein, including the active-site disul®de bond. This ®nding is consistent with the increase in EH largely arising from a decrease in thiol pKa. In addition, we observe a crystallographic dimer of CVWC Trx mediated by crystal contacts.

Crystals of CVWC Trx were prepared by vapor diffusion using the hanging-drop method. Drops (6 ml) of 0.050 M sodium succinate buffer (pH 4.2) containing CVWC Trx (10 mg mlÀ1), methyl ether PEG 2000 [10%(w/v)] and copper(II) acetate (1 mM) were suspended over wells (1.0 ml) of 0.10 M sodium succinate buffer (pH 4.2) containing methyl ether PEG 2000 [20%(w/v)] and copper(II) acetate (2 mM). A cat whisker was used to streak-seed the drops with microcrystals of CVWC Trx grown in a solution of high PEG concentration. The tetragonal crystals were grown at 293 K, appeared within one week and grew to ®nal dimensions of 0.3 Â 0.3 Â 0.4 mm.

2.2. Data collection

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Protein crystallization

CVWC Trx was produced in E. coli and puri®ed as described previously (Chivers, Prehoda, Volkman et al., 1997).

Crystals of CVWC Trx belonged to space group P43212, Ê with unit-cell parameters a = 42.53, c = 105.24 A and  =  =  = 90 . X-ray data were collected with a Siemens HISTAR detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating-anode generator operating at 50 kV and 90 mA with a 300 mm focal spot. The X-ray beam was collimated by double-focusing mirrors. The crystal-to-detector distance was 12.0 cm. Data were obtained in 512 Â 512 pixel format, processed with the program XDS (Kabsch, 1988a,b) and scaled using the program XSCALIBRE (G. Wesenberg and I. Rayment, unpublished work). Frames of data (900 Â 0.15 = 135 ) were collected from a single crystal using a single 9 scan. Re¯ections with I/' < 0.33 were rejected. The crystal was cooled in a 277 K air stream, resulting in negligible crystal decay for the entire data collection. Full crystallographic details are listed in Table 1.

2.3. Molecular replacement

The structure was solved using the molecular-replacement routines in AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The search model consisted of residues 1±31 and 36±108 of E. coli thioredoxin (PDB entry 2trx, molecule A) and was stripped of all solvent molecules. The rotation function was calculated using data Ê Ê Ê from 15±3.5 A, a 40 Â 40 Â 40 A unit cell and a 15 A sphere for self-vectors, and resulted in a single peak of 3.4 standard deviations above the next highest peak. The translation Ê function was calculated using a 2 A grid for the enantiomorphic space groups P41212 and P43212, resulting in R factors of 0.478 and 0.387, respectively. Ten cycles of rigid-body re®nement were applied to the model in space group P43212 and resulted in an R factor of 0.349.

density (Fig. 1b). Strong density connecting Cys32 S to Cys35 S indicated the presence of a disul®de bond.
3.1. Comparison with wild-type thioredoxin

CVWC Trx has an overall structure almost identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. The main-chain atoms of CVWC Trx Ê have an average r.m.s. deviation of 0.52 A from those of wildtype thioredoxin molecule A (PDB entry 2trx). The greatest deviations occur in residues 1±3, with the main chain deviating Ê up to 1 A. When residues 1±3 were excluded, the r.m.s. deviation between CVWC Trx and the wild-type enzyme was Ê Ê 0.50 A. The main chain also deviates by up to 1 A at residues 10 and 20, which are found in surface loops of the protein. The

Prior to least-squares re®nement, 2|Fo| À |Fc|, |Fo| À |Fc| and ' A (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) difference maps were calculated using data in the resolution Ê range 30±3.5 A. The model was examined and was continuous in density for the entire chain. Three residues at the N-terminus were still not clearly de®ned in density and were removed. The starting model (residues 4±31 and 36±108) was subjected to ten cycles of least-squares re®nement using TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987) and data in the resolution range Ê 30±3.0 A, giving an initial R factor of 0.273. A difference Fourier map (|Fo| À |Fc|) clearly showed the position of residues 31±36. These residues were included in the model and Ê re®ned to 2.5 A. Manual adjustments to the model were performed in TURBO-FRODO (Cambillau et al., 1997). After several cycles of manual adjustments and least-squares re®nement, water molecules were added to the model. The peak-searching algorithm in TNT was used to place ordered water molecules. Water molecules were retained if they had at least 1' of 2|Fo| À |Fc| density, 3' of |Fo| À |Fc| density and were within hydrogen-bonding distance of the protein or other water molecules. The density at the N-terminus became clearer and it was apparent that a Cu2+ ion, as also observed in the wild-type structure, was present. The Cu2+ ion was added to a 7' peak in the |Fo| À |Fc| density and re®ned. The N-terminal three residues were then ®tted unambiguously to the density. The ®nal model contains the complete protein (residues 1±108), 81 water molecules and one Cu2+ ion.

3. Results
The structure of CVWC Trx was solved by molecular replacement and re®ned to an R factor of 0.172 using data in the Ê resolution range 30±2.2 A (Fig. 1a). The r.m.s. deviations from Ê target geometries are 0.011 A for bond lengths and 2.27 for bond angles. Average B factors for the main chain and side Ê chain are 25.7 and 38.7 A2, respectively. No B-factor restraints for bonded atoms were applied. The electron density is continuous for the main chain and most of the side chains. The conformation of residues 32±35 was unambiguous and clearly de®ned in both 2|Fo| À |Fc| density and annealed omit |Fo| À |Fc|

C-terminus has a slightly different conformation to that in wild-type Trx. The B factors for the two proteins are similar along the main chain.
3.2. Active-site structure

The substitutions at residues 33 and 34 in CVWC Trx do not create any signi®cant changes in the structure. There is a signi®cant rotation of the side chain of Trp31 owing to a crystal contact. The 11 and 12 angles are 40 and 86 , respectively, for wild-type Trx, and À56 and 107 , respectively, for the CVWC enzyme. The main-chain O atom of Trp31 forms a hydrogen Ê bond of length 2.9 A with the main-chain N atom of a symmetry-related Asp21. The main chain of residues 33 and 34 virtually overlaps with that of the wild-type enzyme. The side

chains are in van der Waals contact with symmetry-related mates in the crystal. N41 of Trp34 makes the only hydrogen Ê bond to a water molecule at a distance of 3.1 A. The dihedral angles for residues 32±35 are typical of those found in an helix. The disul®de bridge has angles similar to those found in wild-type Trx. The 11 and 12 angles of the side chains are 168 and À135 , respectively, for Cys32, and À67 and 86 , respectively, for Cys35. The torsion angle about CÐS ÐS ÐC is Ê 67 . The S ÐS bond length is 2.08 A.
3.3. Crystallographic dimer interface

Extensive contacts are made between the protein and a symmetry partner. The two molecules are related by a crystallographic twofold and the symmetry operator (y, x, Àz). The most extensive crystal contacts occur in residues 85±91 and in the C-terminal -helix. Residues 85±91 form a -strand at the edge of the -sheet and form an antiparallel -strand interaction with residues 91±85 of a symmetry mate (Fig. 2a). Residues 98±106 are in contact with the symmetry-related residues 106±98. The two helices ®t together in a `knobs-andholes' fashion, with the side chains of residues 98 and 101 reaching over the side chain of residue 105 (Fig. 2b). Phe104 and its symmetry mate are buried at the interface but form an Ê unfavorable edge-to-edge interaction at a distance of 3.61 A. Ê The interface buries 706 A2 of surface area.
3.4. Cu2+ binding

CVWC Trx, like the wild-type enzyme, requires copper(II) acetate for crystallization. This requirement exists even though the two enzymes crystallize in different space groups. The Cu atom in CVWC Trx is coordinated at the N-terminus by the main-chain N atoms of Ser1 and Asp2 and three water molecules in square-pyramidal geometry. In contrast, the wildtype coordination is a distorted octahedron and uses the side chains of Asp2 and a symmetry-related Asp10.

Figure 2

CVWC Trx and wild-type Trx crystallized under similar conditions, yet produced different space groups. (Attempts to crystallize CVWC Trx under wild-type conditions failed.) Atomic coordinates of two other crystalline Trx variants have been determined [PDB entries 2tir (Nikkola et al., 1993) and 1tho (M. Nikkola, K. Langsetmo, J. A. Fuchs & H. Eklund, unpublished results)]. Each Trx, including wild-type Trx and CVWC Trx, crystallized in a different space group. In the 2tir and 1tho structures, amino-acid substitutions introduce new hydrogen-bonding groups which make signi®cant crystal contacts. The wild-type crystal form cannot accommodate Val33 and Trp34 of CVWC Trx because of steric and electrostatic con¯icts. There are several intermolecular hydrogen bonds found in the CVWC structure which are not present in wild-type Trx and which result from crystal packing. However, only one speci®c hydrogen bond occurs near residues 33 and

34. The side chain of Trp31 rotates 98 around 11 and 170 around 12 with reference to wild-type Trx. This conformational change avoids a steric con¯ict with a symmetry-related residue. In addition, the main-chain O atom of Trp31 forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain N atom of a symmetryrelated Asp21. The main-chain O atom of Trp31 is available for hydrogen bonding in the wild-type structure; therefore, the structural change in Trp31 is not responsible for the change in space group, but is a result of the crystal packing. The energetic cost of solvating a tryptophan side chain [ÁGobs = 3.07 kcal molÀ1 (1 kcal molÀ1 = 4.184 kJ molÀ1)] or a valine side chain (ÁGobs = 1.66 kcal molÀ1) is high (Eisenberg & McLachlan, 1986). Desolvation of these residues could contribute signi®cantly to crystal-lattice stability. In CVWC Trx, Val33 and Trp34 lie in a hydrophobic pocket created by hydrocarbons in the side chains of Lys3, Ile5 and Ile23, and Gln50 and Thr54 C2 of a symmetry-related molecule. This hydrophobic interaction could drive the formation of the space group. Interestingly, the copper ion is coordinated by a symmetryrelated Asp10 side chain in both the wild-type and 1tho structures, even though these enzymes crystallized in different space groups. CVWC Trx also brings a symmetry-related Ê Asp10 within 6.1 A of the copper ion, but it is not involved in coordination. CVWC Trx forms a dimer-like structure in the crystal. The largest number of protein±protein crystal contacts involve residues 85±91 from the -sheet (Fig. 2a) and 98±106 from the C-terminal -helix (Fig. 2b). The monomers come together at a crystallographic twofold axis with the -sheets meeting edgeto-edge in antiparallel fashion. The resulting dimer forms a ten-stranded mixed parallel and antiparallel -sheet. The C-terminal -helix forms a `knobs-and-holes' interaction with the C-terminal helix from a symmetry mate. In a favorable interaction, Phe104 is buried at the interface. There are no water-mediated contacts at the interface. The surface area Ê buried by the dimer exceeds 700 A2, which is well within the range observed for protein dimers (Jones & Thornton, 1995). Gel-®ltration chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggest that CVWC Trx may exist as both monomers and dimers in solution (P. T. Chivers and R. T. Raines, unpublished results). In contrast, analytical ultracentrifugation of the CVWC enzyme revealed no signi®cant dimer formation in solution at concentrations up to 30 mM (data not shown). However, this concentration is signi®cantly lower than that of the crystallization solution (1 mM). E. coli Trx has never been shown to dimerize. Human Trx does dimerize in a crystalline state (Weichsel et al., 1996), but this dimer differs signi®cantly from that of CVWC Trx and is not present in solution (Gronenborn et al., 1999). PDI contains four Trx domains, but there is little structural information available to describe the interaction of these domains. Recently, the structure of a protein-disul®de oxidoreductase from Pyrococcus furiosus (PDIPf) was reported (Ren et al., 1998). This protein is a covalent dimer of two slightly different Trx-like domains. Like CVWC Trx, the domains come together to form a continuous -sheet capped by two interlocked

-helices. However, the interface occurs at the opposite edge of the -sheet to that of CVWC Trx. The dimers of CVWC Trx and PDIPf are topologically similar and either may represent a model for the interaction of the Trx-like domains of PDI.
4.2. Active site

The active site of Trx is found at the beginning of a long -helix which protrudes from the enzyme (Fig. 1a). Located on the surface of the enzyme, Cys32 is poised to interact with a wide variety of substrates. Introduction of tryptophan and valine at positions 33 and 34 in Trx has no signi®cant effect on the overall conformation of the oxidized active site. In CVWC Trx, the conformation of the Cys32±Cys35 disul®de bond and the position of Asp26 are almost identical to those in the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1b). Yet, the CVWC variant has a higher reduction potential (EH = À0.230 V) than wild-type Trx H (EH = À0.270 V), with ÁEH = EH variant À Ewild-type = 0.040 V (Chivers et al., 1996). Reduction potential is a measure of the relative stability of the dithiol and disul®de forms. An increase in reduction potential is an expression of the increased stability of the dithiol form relative to the disul®de form. This increase can arise from two factors: (i) a decrease in the pKa of one or both thiols or (ii) an increase in the intrinsic reduction potential (ÁE ) of the disul®de bond (Chivers, Prehoda & Raines, 1997). In wild-type Trx and all known variants, Cys35 titrates at a pH >> 7 (Chivers, Prehoda, Volkman et al., 1997). Hence, a change in the pKa of the Cys35 thiol cannot contribute signi®cantly to changes in EH of CVWC Trx. In contrast, the value of EH does depend on the pKa of the Cys32 thiol, which H titrates at pH 7. At 298 K, ÁEH = EH variant À EwildÀtype is related to the pKa of the Cys32 thiol by 2 ÁE  0X03 log

which is derived from equation 5 in Chivers, Prehoda & Raines (1997). Given that pKwild type = 7.50 and pKvariant = 6.16 a a (Chivers, Prehoda, Volkman et al., 1997), then from (1) ÁEH = 0.023 V at pH 7.0. Thus, a change in the pKa of the Cys32 thiol is responsible for most of the observed ÁEH of 0.040 V. What is the structural basis for the change in the pKa of the Cys32 thiol? Here, pKa is a measure of the relative stabilities of the thiol and thiolate forms. In CVWC Trx, the pKa of Cys32 is lower than that in wild-type Trx (Chivers et al., 1996). Cys32 resides at the N-terminus of an -helix (Fig. 1a). The thiolate form of Cys32 can be stabilized by the -helix dipole (Forman-Kay et al., 1991; Kortemme et al., 1996). Introduction of the hydrophobic residues valine and tryptophan near the N-terminus may enhance this favorable Coulombic interaction. Indeed, calculations with the program SYBIL (version 6.5; Tripos, St Louis, MO, USA) indicate that the dipole moment of the -helix formed by residues 32±49 increases by 17% in the CVWC variant (data not shown). In the more hydrophobic active site of the variant, the Cys32 thiolate

would be less shielded from the -helix dipole by water and solute ions. The decrease in the pKa of the Cys32 thiol does not explain all of the increase in the reduction potential of the Cys32±Cys35 disul®de bond in CVWC Trx. The substitution in the CXXC motif must change the intrinsic reduction potential by ÁE  0.017 V. Replacing Pro33 could do so by increasing the conformational entropy of the dithiol form and thereby increasing the entropic cost of forming a disul®de bond. In addition, alterations in solvent structure within the active site could affect the value of ÁE, as has been observed in pseudoazurin (Libeu et al., 1997).

5. Conclusions
The CXXC motif is used by enzymes to catalyze the oxidation of dithiols and the reduction and isomerization of disul®de bonds. The activity of the CXXC motif relies upon a careful balance between reduction potential (dithiol±disul®de equilibrium) and pKa (protonation state). The sequence of residues in the CXXC motif is a major contributor to setting the values of these parameters. CVWC Trx has an increased reduction potential and a decreased pKa compared with those of wildtype Trx. Thus, addition of valine and tryptophan residues in the active site alters the catalytic properties of the enzyme without signi®cantly altering the structure, at least of the oxidized enzyme.
