Abstract--The novel 8-piperazinyl-2,3-dihydropyrroloisoquinoline template was synthesized in nine steps. The template was Nsubstituted to give a series of compounds showing binding to human cloned 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors with pKiÕs greater than 9 and selectivities up to 1000-fold against other serotonin, dopamine and adrenergic receptors. Several compounds were shown to possess weak partial agonist activity in cloned receptors, which translated to antagonism in in vitro studies. Ó 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although the precise mechanism of antidepressant action remains poorly understood, many currently prescribed treatments for depression are believed to enhance neurotransmission by increasing extracellular levels of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the brain.1 Neuronal 5-HT release is modulated by presynaptic inhibitory 5-HT1 autoreceptors. 5-HT1A receptors are mainly somatodendritic, and cause a reduction in the rate of cell firing and 5-HT release when stimulated.2 5-HT1B receptors are mainly located on cell terminals, where they mediate a reduction in the amount of 5-HT released on each firing event.3 The role of terminal 5-HT1D receptors is less clear, although there is recent evidence to suggest that they play a role in modulating extracellular brain 5-HT levels in guinea pig.4 The com-

bined activation of all three receptor subtypes by extracellular 5-HT thus has the potential to cause a decrease in the amount and frequency of 5-HT released into the synaptic cleft. Stimulation of these autoreceptors may be responsible for the delayed onset of action of most antidepressants which work wholly or partly by inhibiting 5-HT reuptake.5 The two to four week onset time for these antidepressants is consistent with the time taken for these autoreceptors to desensitize in rats upon treatment with fluoxetine or citalopram.6 Therefore, a drug which antagonizes all 5-HT1 inhibitory autoreceptors simultaneously should acutely mimic their chronic desensitization, and thereby lead to an immediate and sustained increase in levels of synaptic 5-HT for each transmission event.5 Such a drug could well provide a much needed rapidly acting antidepressant. We have previously reported the in vitro pharmacology of SB-272183, the first selective 5-HT1A/B/D receptor antagonist.7 In this paper we describe the synthesis

and pharmacology of a new series of highly potent and selective 5-HT1A/B/D receptor partial agonists/ antagonists. The novel dihydropyrrolo[3,2-g]isoquinoline template 10 was proposed from a pharmacophore alignment of the indoline SB-272183 (1) and a series of naphthylpiperazines,8 e.g., 2, with reported 5-HT1 pKiÕs > 6.2.

The synthesis is illustrated in Scheme 1. Indole-6-carboxylic acid (3) was converted to the N-monobenzylated indoline 4 by dibenzylation; reduction of the five-membered ring; and saponification of the ester, all under standard conditions. To construct the pyridyl ring, a procedure related to the Pomeranz­Fritsch method was used via the intermediate 2,2-dimethoxyethyl amide 5. Treatment of 5 with Brønsted acids (H2SO4, TFA or HCl) gave rise to a mixture of cyclized regioisomers, presumably by partially favouring N-protonation of the indoline leading to intramolecular delivery of the proton to the acetal, so that the reactive oxonium species is formed in proximity to the 7-position of the indoline. The use of boron trifluoride-diethyl etherate in refluxing THF gave a single regioisomer 6, easily distinguished from the alternative regioisomer by the presence of two new singlets in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR. This is consistent with selective boron complexation of the acetal oxygen atoms, leading to formation of the reactive oxonium intermediate in the less hindered region of the molecule, and favouring reaction at the 5-position of the indoline. Attempts to cyclize analogues of 5 with N-acyl protecting groups were not successful. The hydroxy group of isoquinoline 6 was readily activated by triflation, and displaced by N-methyl piperazine. Debenzylation was effected by catalytic hydrogenation under strongly acidic conditions, giving the key intermediate 9, which was coupled to form amides and ureas under standard conditions.

Analogues of the N-methyl piperazine moiety were introduced into intermediate triflate 7 and further derivatized using analogous procedures to those outlined in Scheme 1. The 4-cyanophenyl pyrazole carboxylic acid intermediate 26 used in the synthesis of 22 was prepared by combination of 4-cyanophenyl hydrazine with the dimethylaminomethylene oxopentanoate ester 249 followed by saponification, as per Scheme 2. Compounds were tested for their activity at 5-HT1 receptors using standard binding assays with [3H]5HT or [3H]8-OH-DPAT as the radioligand (Table 1). Substituted benzamides showed clear SAR with 4-substituents showing higher affinity than two or three isomers. Heterocycles were also tolerated in this position with some loss of potency, but this was restored with biaryl groups. The N-methyl piperazinyl group proved relatively insensitive to steric modifications: removal of the methyl group (31) resulted in only a slight loss of potency, but a dramatic loss of selectivity against the b2 adrenoreceptor (Table 2). Increasing the size of the N-alkyl substituent caused the affinity to diminish incrementally (32, 33). The 3,5-dimethylpiperazine 34 showed somewhat reduced activity particularly at the 5-HT1A receptor, but replacement of the N-methyl piperazine with either enantiomer of diazabicyclooctane was well tolerated (35, 36). Compounds in this series showed a wide range of efficacies vs 5-HT for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor subtypes

in the GTPcS functional assay7 (Table 3). For both aryl and heteroaryl compounds, a para-substituent tended to engender higher intrinsic activity, whilst an ortho-substituent adjacent to the linking carboxamide showed lower intrinsic activity approaching silent antagonism, suggesting a role for the torsional angle of the ring-C@O bond. Despite this intrinsic activity in the recombinant GTPcS assay, compounds with intrinsic activities below 0.5 behaved as antagonists in 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor-mediated native tissue assays. Hence, the phenyl pyrazole 22 reversed the inhibition of rat dorsal raphe nucleus cell firing by the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (pA2  7); and it potentiated the electrically stimulated release of 5-HT from guinea pig cortex slices, which has been previously demonstrated to be mediated by the 5-HT1B receptor.7 After intravenous infusion, compounds in this series showed a wide range of clearance rates in rat, from less than 25% of liver blood flow to approximately 100%, and an equally broad range of brain penetration (Table 4).10 The 4-cyanobenzamide 12 showed a lower rate of clearance but also lower brain penetration than the isosteric 4-chlorobenzamide 11, consistent with its lower lipophilicity. The quinolinyl amide 16 showed rapid clearance

and limited brain penetration. In contrast, the smaller heterocycles showed more acceptable clearance; however whilst the dimethyloxazole 18 showed good brain penetration, the closely related methyl-trifluoromethyl pyrazole 19 did not. The addition of the phenyl ring restored the brain penetration and provided compounds with low to moderate clearance and promising oral bioavailability. In particular, compound 22 showed moderate to good bioavailability across species: rat 50%, guinea pig 20%, dog 89% and cynomolgous monkey 58%. Compound 22 was further studied in in vivo pharmacodynamic models based on 5-HT1B receptor antagonism. In rats, 22 reversed the effects of the selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist SKF-99101 on electroshock seizure threshold, with an oral ID50 of 3.5 ± 1.3 mg/kg.11 In guinea pigs, 22 reversed SKF-99101-induced hypothermia with an oral ID50 of 0.2 mg/kg.12 Compound 22 and related compounds are under further investigation in preclinical models of depression.
