synthetase from E~cherichia coli (a dimer of molecular Native methionyl-tRNA weight 172,000) can be converted by mild proteolysis into a well-defined monomeric fragment of molecular weight 64,000. This fragment retains full specificity towards methionine and tRNAMe', and has unimpaired activity in both the activation and aminoacylation reactions. This paper describes the structure of the active fragment, as determined by an Xray crystallographic study at 2.5 A resolution using five heavy-atom derivatives. The elongated molecule (90 A x 52 A x 44 A) contains several n-helices, which account for 43% of the residues. Three domains can be distinguished in the structure: (1) a central core beginning at the N-terminus, consisting of a fivest.randed parallel pleated sheet with a-helices connecting the fi-strands; (2) a second domain with less-ordered structure, inserted between the third and fourth strand of t,he central sheet; (3) a C-terminal domain, beginrling after the fifth parallel strand. very rich in n-helices. These three domains are organized in a biglobular structure ; one globule contains the first and the second domain (N-terminal globule), the other the third domain. The two globules, linked together by a single chain, are separated by a large cleft. The most salient feature of the structure is the presence, in the N-terminal domain, of a "nucleotide binding fold" similar t)o that first observed in This makes methionyl-tRNA synthetase, and possibly all dehydrogenases. aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a new member of this family of nucleotide binding proteins possessing the characteristic "Rossmann fold".

1. Introduction
The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases play a key role in the translation of the genetic code during protein synthesis. These enzymes, whose function is to specifically aminoacylate their cognate transfer RNA, have been the subject of number of studies aimed at elucidating their catalytic mechanism (for recent reviews, see Goddard, 1977; Ofengand, 1978; Schimmel B S611. 1979). These studies have been focused on two main questions : (1) how can the genetic message be translated with

such a high fidelit,y : and (2) how can a protein specifically recognize a nucleic acid ! As to the first point. several mechanisms have been posbulated (Hopfield. 1974: l'ort der Haar. 1977: Fersht,. 1977: Lestienne. 3978: Wright,, 1980). which ma! explain the surprisingly low overall error ratr in protein synthesis. As t)o the question of nucleic acid recognition, the problems raised by the specific interaction bebween a ligase and its cognate tRNA can probably be solved only by the study of' a crystalline complex of the two partners. Solution experiments. however. havtt provided useful information on the mode of binding of the t,wo species (for a revir\\ out see Schimmel. 1979). Regarding the methionine system. it is wort)h pointing t,hat the at'omic structures of both initiator tRXAs""' from yeast (Schevit.z rf ~1.. coli (Woo el al.. 1980) are available. This provides a basis fat. 1979) and Eschwichia further detailed consideration of the it&t-action between MetRSt and tRYAM". Not,e also that MetRS is uniyue in the sense that it, is able to recaognize specifically t,wo differrnt tRNAs with different base sequences, that is. the init,iator and the elongat,or tRXAs"". In the early seventies. the first aminoacyl-tRNA s,vnthet)ases t,o be obtained in a crystalline form were the yeast' enzymes specific for lysinr (Rymo cf ~1.. 1970) and leucine (Chirikjian et al.. 1972) ; yet the crystal struct'ure analysis of these rttzyrws could not be completed. At the same time. Cassio & Wallet- (1971a) showed t,hat methionyl-tRNA synthetase from E. coli could be ctleaved by proteases witholtt loss of enzymic activity. The limit,ed proteolysis converts t>he natjive dimcr of' molecular weight 172,000 (Koch & Bruton: 1974) int,o a well-defined monomeric. fragment of molecu1a.r weight 64.000. It is most remarkable t.hat, despite t.hr loss of' nearly 25"/0 of the polypeptide chain, the fragment, is still fully active in both the, activation and the aminoacylatiott reactions, and retains full specificity towards methiottine and tR,NAMe' (for a review, see Blanquet pt 02.. 1979). The main difference between the two proteins lies in the stoichiometry of substrate binding : namely, the monomeric fragment contains only one site for met'hionine. ATP and tRXAMet (Fayat & Waller. 1974; Rlanyuet, rt (I/.. 1973 : Dessen et al.. 1982), Moreover, whereas native MetRS had never been obtained in a crystalline state, thti fragment) could be crystallized in a form suitable for a high-resolution X-ra> diffraction study (Wailer et al.. 1971). A low-resolution model of this fragment) has already been described (Zelwer et al.. 1976); its structure, as determinrd by a %..5 .i resolution study, is described in this paper. A brief account of this work has bcctt published (Risler et al.. 1981). So far, the only ot'her synthetase studied by high-resolution ~ryst,allograpltic~ techniques is tprosyl-tRNA syrtthetase from Bacillus s/enroth,errn,ophilu~s (Reid ot al., 1973). The structure of this molecule has been published (Irwin rf rxl.. 1!)76) and is presently being refined (T. N. Bhat, D. M. Blow, I'. Brick, C. Monteilhet R VT.Nyborg. Ah&. EMBO-FEBIS tRNA Workshop. Strasboury. 7980). Detailed crystallographic studies on the binding of substrates and analogues to tyrosyitRNA synthetase have also been reported (Monteilhet 8: Blow. 1978; Rubin & Blow. 1981). Thus. the structures of two different aminoacyl-tRNA syttt,hetases will be available in the near future.

A special mention should be made of the yeast aspartic acid system. Crystals are available for aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (Dietrich et al., 1980), its cognate tRNAASp (Giege et al., 1977) and even the protein-nucleic acid complex (Giege et al., 1980). The crystal structure of yeast tRNA Asp has been determined at 35 A resolution 1980). Finally, promising (Moras et al., crystals of B. stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase have been reported (Carter & Carter, 1979). 2. Material and Methods

(a) Crystals and heavy-atom derivatives Purified MetRS (tryptic fragment) was supplied by S. Blanquet, G. Fayat and J. P. Waller (Cassio & Waller, 1971a,6), and crystallized by dialysis of a protein solution (5 mg/ml) against 1.3 M-ammonium citrate (pH 7.0), as described by Waller et al. (1971). The symmetry is monoclinic (space-group PZ,) with a = 78.1 A, b = 46.2 8, c = 87.9 8, fl = 108%" and one molecule is contained in the asymmetric unit. The crystals grow as plates, often more than 2 mm long, but rarely exceeding 92 mm in thickness. If kept in ammonium citrate, the crystals are very stable (no bacterial growth occurs in this medium) and can be stored for years without loss of diffracting power or activity in the ATP-PP, exchange reaction. As a consequence, the same batch of enzyme could be used for 7 years; after each crystallization the best crystals were selected and kept in ammonium citrate, while the remaining crystals were redissolved and re-crystallized. The crystallization medium, however, is unsuitable for the preparation of heavy-atom derivatives since metals are chelated by citrate. Therefore, crystals were transferred to 3.2 M-ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0) prior to use in diffraction experiments (including the "parent" derivative). The transfer, performed in 5 steps in order to avoid disordering the crystals, results in no significant change in the unit cell parameters. However, once transferred, the crystals become less stable and must be used within a few days. Heavy-atom derivatives were obtained by soaking pre-grown crystals in 3.2 M-ammonium sulfate solutions containing the desired compound. As described previously (Monteilhet et al.. 1974), 2 derivatives had already been obtained with U02F2- and Pt(CN):-. Search for other potential derivatives was made by checking intensity changes on precession photographs (ho2 zone) and, if necessary, on 2-dimensional difference Fourier maps. Typical soaking conditions for preparing the 5 derivatives are given in Table 1. (b) High-resolution data collection and processing Three-dimensional diffraction data to 2-5 A resolution for the parent enzyme and the 5 derivatives were recorded on a Nonius Arndt-Wonacott oscillation camera (Arndt et al.,

The focus size was 03 mm x 3 mm. suitable for t.he use of a graphite mortochromat,or (a smaller focus would yield a heterogeneous beam due to the graphite mosaicity). The crystals were kept, at 4°C by means of a stream of cold dried air. Monochromatization, together wit,h cooling, sigmficantiy increased the crystals' lifetime (about 32 h in the conditions described above). A 93 mm was used throughout, and the crystal-to-film distance was 60 mm. The beam collimator divergence was reduced by removing the collimator 20 cm away from the monochromat,or (see Fig. 1): this produced a quasi-parallel beam (a prerequisitr for adequat,e absorption c:orrection a.ith crystals larger than the beam) and reduced the size of t,he diffracted spots For data collection. crystals were mounted with the n-axis parallel t.o the spindle axis. The oscillation range varied from 1.4" to 2.0". according to the orientation of the crystal undr~ study. The exposure time was usually 3 h per degree. The total range of rotat,ion was 180" for the samarium derivative (thus. the Friedel pairs could be recorded) and 90" for the other ones. Every first film of a new carousel overlapped by approx. I" t,he last, film of the preceding carousel so as not to lose the partially recorded reflections. In many instancrs the crystals were long enough t.o be translat$ed by 05 mm after one exposure. thus bringing a fresh portion into the beam ; so the same crystal could be used for 2 or 3 exposures. Absorption correction was deemed necessary, t)he plat,e-shaped crystals being highly anisometric. For this purpose, the transmission of the direct X-ray beam t,hrough t.he crystals was measured on a proportional counter as explained in Fig. I. This method. whose underlying principles have been described by Schwager rt nl. (1973). enables one t,o calculate the transmission surface for each crystal and t,o apply the absorption correction for any given reflection

Fm. 1. F:xperimental set-up for the measurement of crystal absorption. The intensity of the direct beam passing through the crystal x is measured on a proportional counter (PC) set on the camera at, the position of the carousel. For this method to be effective. the crystal must be sufficiently large to attenuate the whole of the incident beam. Therefore a 0.1 mm collimator (c) was used for the transmission measurements, and an adjustable slit (s) was placed between the crystal and the counter to make sure that all the recorded photons had crossed the crystal. The transmission data were recorded as a function of the rotation angle C$(5" intervals) and the inclination angle 0 (lo" intervals). He is the helium-filled tube inserted between the collimator c and the graphite monochromator (m). Above. Two typical absorption curves. The transmission is minimum when the plane of the crystal is parallel to the X-ray beam (curve A) and maximum when the crystal is perpendicular to the beam (curve R).

The intensities were measured on an Optronics drum scanner. interfaced to a Varian 620Orsay). A raster of 50 pm was used L/l00 computer (Centre de MicrodensitomBtrie, throughout). The films were either Ilford Industrial G or Kodak Kodirex. Corrections for non-linearity in film response was performed using look-up Tables, which were prepared by measuring the optical densities in areas of test films submitted to various doses of X-rays : the corresponding corrections were then applied locally for each measurement. Despite the differences of speed, grain size and chemical fog level between the 2 types of films, no systematic difference could be observed after completion of data processing. There was no other local treatment of the data except averaging of the optical densities of every 4 adjacent measurements (after a suggestion by J. Janin). This process leads to a 4-fold reduction in the amount of data to be handled, while keeping the Wooster (1964) effect low. The computer programs used for the integration of the diffracted intensities were basically those of the "Cambridge system" from Nyborg, Wonacott, Thierry, Champness & Horsnell (Nyborg & Wonacott, 1977). These programs, originally written for a PDP-11 controlled densitometer, were modified for an off-line use on an IBM 370-168 computer. As shown in Fig. 2 the flat, parallelepipedic-crystals produce reflections that are rather heterogeneous in of the integration box shape, size and separation ; as a consequence the proper adjustment
becomes rather tricky. We solved this problem by using a computer routine that

automatically calculates the size of the integration box in terms of the dimensions and orientations of the plate-shaped crystals. The intensities for the parent and the 5 heavy-atom derivatives were then merged and

FIG. 2. An oscillation photograph (oscillation angle 1.7") showing the variation in the shapes of the diffracted spots as a function of their position on the film. This phenomenon arises from the fact that the crystals are flat plates. The relative intensities of the spots on this Figure have been altered on purpose by the photographic processing, which results in the lightening of the weakest reflections. The edge of the photograph corresponds to a resolution of 2.5 A.

However. due to the geometry of the oscillation method, approx. 50% of the reflections are recorded at least' twice. The 6 data sets each consist of approx. 20,000 independent reflections. The weakest of them (approx. 2000 reflections less than 5oj of the average amplitude) gave Rsymvalues greater than @5 and were eliminated (see legend to Table 2). We also rejected another set, of about 1000 reflections ot random amplitudes that showed very poor symmetry agreement. The reflections belonging to the blind zone when oscillated about a were recorded on oscillation photographs around h. For reasons not yet clear these reflections correlate poorly with those recorded about a, and were ignored. The blind zone represents approx. 3 ?$, of the reciprocal space at 2.5 Ah resolution (Wonacott, 1977). Some statistical data on intensity measurements are given in Table 2.

(c) Heavy-atom pammetrrs Three-dimensional difference Patterson maps for the platinum and uranium derivatives were consistent with the previous interpretation (Monteilhet et al., 1974). which was based on low-resolution precession data. These derivatives produced a preliminary set of phases from which the samarium sites were located by a difference Fourier map, and found marly identical to the uranium sites (Table 3). In order to gain additional information, we madtx use of the strong anomalous component of samarium. When recording Friedel pairs photographically, it is common practice to set the oscillation axis parallel to a rotational symmetry axis of the crystal, so that each Friedel pair is measured on the same film. However, since the b-axis is the shortest in the MetRS unit cell, this procedure would lead to a decrease in the size of the individual sectors, thereby increasing the total number of films and decreasing the accuracy in the merging and scaling step. The strategy of recording Friedel mates on different films that was adopted here increases the number of common reflections betwee; sectors, which presumably results in a better scaling. This means that, the Friedel pairs were treated as equal reflections for scaling purposes, but subsequently treated as different to establish the Bijvoet difference. Despite the fact that Bijvoet pairs were not

Heavy-atom parameters were refitted by alternate cycles of phasing and refinement using a program written by L. F. Tert Eyck (Ten Eyck & Arttorte. 19'76). The presence of additional mittor sites was checked by difference Fourier or residual maps. We found 6 minor Pt and I minor V sites t,hat had not been detect,ed in t,hr low-resolution study, probably because of the poorer quality of the precession data. which had not been corrected for absorption.

Then all the Br-ATP at,oms were added (but not refined) in t,he structure-fact,or calculations with their measured co-ordinates, the occupancy of t,he refitted Br atom and a temperature factor of 10 a*. The strongest Cd sit,e (not bound to ATP) is identical to t,he main U and Sm sites. The refinement of the Br and Cd sites indicates little phasing power for the Br-ATP derivative (Fig. 3). However, as ittdicated by t,he improvementj of the anomalous phasing power of the Sm derivative (Fig. 3). t'he Br-ATP dt&at,irc effect,ively contributes to the refinement process.

The electron density map was calculated using a Fast Fourier Transform program from I,. F. Ten Eyrk (1973). The contours were traced directly on acetate sheets on a large Benson flat-bed plotter (1.60 m x 1% m). The sheets were glued on Perspex frames and mount,ed vertically in the Richards' box. Interpretat,ion of this map proved to be relat,ively easy and a ttltttat>ive model of the polypeptide backbone was built at the scale 125 cm/a (this model was presented at the EMBO-FEBS workshop held in Strasbourg. July 1980). ilt the time we wet-t' ittt.erpret'ittg t'his map, we became aware of the use of electron density modification tecahttiques as applied to the study of yeast tRNA ye' (Schevitz rf al., 1981 ; P. B. Sigler. personal commuttication). Startittg frotn the m.i.r. electron density map, this method improves the phases through an iterat)ive process based upon 2 cottdiiions: (1) the electron density is nori-ttegative: and (2) thta electron density is constant throughout, the solvent regions. It is notewort,hy t'hat no interpretation of the initial map is required besides the definition of the molecular envelope. This method was thus applied to MetItS and resulted in a map that. without upsetting the previous interpretation of the chain folding. was of bet,ter qua1it.v in the sense t,hat : (1) some ambiguous regions wit,h rat,her low densities were better dt+ined: (2) positive densities appeared in those few places in which the chain had to run through den&y gaps: and (3) many side-chains appeared more clearly, either inside or at t,he periphery of the molecule. 4 detailed description of the m&hod and of its result,s will be

3. Results and Discussion
(a) Interpretation
of thr electron density map

One typical feature of the electron density map is t'he high proportion of regular secondary structure, that is, n-helices and fl-strands, a fact that is of great help in t'he interpretation of the map. More particularly, most of the side-chains belonging t'o the helices stand up clearly so as to specify the sense of the polypeptide chain (the Cts atoms point towards the N-terminus of the helix). The schematic drawing in Figure 4 emphasizes the fact that the model of MetRS accounts for 16 helices, containing 4326 of the residues. Most of the map can be interpreted with reasonable c~onfidence. except in one region. As an example. the electron density corresponding to a five-stranded pleated sheet is shown in Figure 5. Admittedly, one could expect'
mot-c detail in a 8.5 ir map, a point that raises the question of the quality of the

phasing (ue have used live heavy-atom derivatives. but only t\vo of t,hrm. Pt ad IT. or Pt and Sm. are reallv independeut). Howc~vcr. mainly because of the high proportion of helives. we are confident, that the overall interpretation of the c+haill path is corrwt and t)hat the present model will provide a ust,fuI starting point fill, further refinement.

(b) Overall

description

of the molecule

An overall view of the structure of MetRS is given in Figure 6 ; note first the anisometric shape of the molecule, whose overall dimensions are approximately in the polypeptide chain. 90 A x 52 A x 44 A. Three domains can be distinguished (i) A central core containing a five-stranded parallel pleated sheet with helices cormecting the strands (squares in Fig. 6). Starting from the N-terminus, the chain enters the pleated sheet through its central strand at residue 9. (ii) A second domain (triangles, bottom of Fig. 6) inserted between the third and fourth strand of the central sheet, with a more loosely organized structure. This

domain extends from residue 110 to residue 246, where the chain folds back into the pleated sheet via the fourth /? strand. (iii) A third domain (triangles, top of Fig. 6) beginning at residue 284 after the fifth /3 strand and ending at the C-terminus (residue 480). In this part of the molecule, 57% of the residues belong to n-helices. These three domains form a biglobular structure, as is clearly depicted in Figure 6(b). One globule, bearing the N terminus, contains the first two domains (bottom of Fig. 6); the second globule coincides with the third domain. The two globules, separated by a large cleft, are linked together by a single chain at the end of the central pleated sheet (arrows in Fig. 6). It is worth pointing out that the structure does not contain obvious and large structural repeats. Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with polypeptide chains of 800 residues or more contain a significant proportion of repeated sequences (for a review, see Schimmel & Siill, 1979). This is indeed the case for native MetRS, but. a significant number of the duplicated sequences are split off by the tryptic digestion (Bruton et al., 1974; Bruton, 1979). The extent of repeated sequences in the active fragment might therefore be too small to produce clear structural repeats. (c) Nucleotide binding domain As we have pointed out recently (Risler et al., 1981), one remarkable feature of the model lies in the central part of the molecule. This domain, composed of five parallel strands separated by helices, is strikingly similar to that of the "nucleotide binding domain" first observed in dehydrogenases (Rossmann et aZ., 1974; Ohlsson et al., 1974). A closer view of this domain is shown in Figure 7. together with a schematic drawing emphasizing the relative positions of the helices and strands. The same topology has been found in phosphoglycerate kinase (Blake & Evans, 1974) and in phosphorylase (Fletterick et al., 1976; Weber et al., 1978). Moreover, in t,he crystals of MetRS the nucleotide 8-bromo-ATP is bound near the C-terminus of the central sheet, which is also the case for NAD or ATP in the proteins cited above. Thus, MetRS is a new member of the family of nucleotide binding proteins exhibiting the characteristic "Rossmann fold". (d) Location of the zinc atom It has been demonstrated recently that MetRS (either in the dimeric or the monomeric form) is a metalloprotein containing one zinc per protomer (Posorske et al., 1979; Mayaux& Blanquet, 1981). Therefore we expected some feature in the electron density map to correspond to the metal atom. The map contains one strong peak located in the second domain, whose amplitude is 1.7 times greater

In the 2 drawings the "nucleotide binding domain " is depicted by square markers. The broken lines at the bottom of each drawing correspond to a region where the electron density is ill-defined. The chain path in this part of the molecule is tentative. As can be seen most clearly in (b), the structure of MetRS is biglobular. The arrows point to the single link between the 2 globules.

than that of any other peak. However, the position of this peak is very close (approx. 2 a) to the strongest binding site shared by t,he C, Sm and Cd derivatives: too close indeed for the Zn and the heavy-metal atoms t'o be simultaneously present. The possibility that the heavy atoms displace the zinc was ruled out by flame emission spectroscopy experiments (,J. F. Mayaux. unpublished), which demonstrated that crystals of heavy-atom derivatives (r, Sm and Cd), once washed and redissolved, still contain Zn in stoichiometric amounts. A second possibility is that the strong peak does indeed correspond to the ZIP atom, but, that it is distorted by negative ripples originating from ghosts of the heavy at,oms. Further experiments (for instance; the study of a crystalline complex with 1-lOphenanthroline) are thus needed to clarify this point (Yosorske rt al., 1979: Mayaux. 1981).

(e) Binding

of substrates to methionyl-tRNA

Let us first consider the binding of ATP. Most probably, %bromo-ATP . Cd'+ (which was used as a heavy-atom marker) binds to crystalline MetRS at the ATP Mg `+ binding site : (1) solution experiments show that %bromoand 8amino-adenosine are both competitive inhibitors of the ATP-PP, exchange reaction (Lawrence et al., 1974; Blanquet et al., 1975): (2) only one binding site is observed in solution (Fayat & Waller, 1974) as well as in the crystal; (3) %bromoATP binds to crystalline MetRS near the C-terminal end of the central pleated sheet', like NAD or ATP in dehydrogenases and kinases (in our current interpretation, this binding involves contacts with residues belonging to the loop between the first (central) strand and the first helix, and with side-chains of the first helix). Therefore, 8-bromo-ATP probably binds to the ATP binding site. However, this point has to be further clarified ; the diffraction data pertaining to the enzymeBTP . Mg2+ complex are presently being recorded. A detailed comparison between the structures and the mode of binding of ATP and 8-bromo-ATP will be reported later. With regard to the interaction between MetRS and L-methionine, solution experiments show that saturating concentrations of methionine enhance the protein fluorescence emission by 26%. in contrast with the binding of ATP Mg2+ et cd., which results in no significant change in the protein fluorescence (Blanquet 1972). This observation suggests the occurrence of a conformational change upon binding of methionine, which is further supported by the cracking of MetRS crystals produced by methionine diffusion. Attempts to co-crystallize the enzymemethionine complex led to the formation of micro-crystalline needles, which could not be grown to a satisfactory size. However, we have recently observed that a minor crystal form of MetRS, present in the crystallization batches along with the by intensity major species studied here, can bind the amino acid (as indicated changes) without cracking. These crystals are also monoclinic (space-group P2,) with a = 78.9 8, b = 45.0 A, c = 86.7 A and /3 = 107.5". Although the two crystal forms are not isomorphous, this preliminary experiment suggests that a crystallographic study of the methionine-MetRS complex may be feasible. Finally, let us discuss the interaction between tRNA""' and MetRS. As regards the native, dimeric enzyme, Dube (1973) sh owed that MetRS protects the anticodon loop and part of the 3' stem against digestion by T, ribonuclease, while Schulman & Goddard (1973) demonstrated that the base change CJ5 + U3s (in the anticodon loop) and CT6 + U,6 (in the 3' single strand) results in the loss of methionine acceptor activity for tRNAp' (see also Stern & Schulman, 1977; Schulman & Pelka, 1977). Concerning the active fragment of MetRS, photocrosslinking studies also establish that the contact occurs at the anticodon loop and t'he 3'.terminal residues, with both native and trypsin-modified MetRS (Rosa et al., 1979). Thus, the two ends of the L-shaped tRNA molecule are likely to interact with the synthetase. According to whether the single strand at the 3' end is in a stacked or in an extended conformation, the distance between the terminal adenosine and the anticodon in tRNAPh' can vary from 46 .& to 80 a (Kim, 1976). Since it has been shown that the structures of the initiator tRNAs from yeast and E. coli are both similar to that of tRNAPh' (Schevitz et al., 1979; Woo et al., 1980).

for tRNX""`. Obviously. for thtk t)hese distances are probably also valid aminoacylation of the terminal adenosine to occur, the acscaeptor end of t'RNA"" must bind t,o MetRS near the ATP binding site. that is. near the cetttral pleat,ed sheet. Hence. if the 3' sittgle strand remaitts extended after its binding to MetRS. the a,ttticodott cannot simultaneously ittt,eract with the prot,eitt unless conspicuous c~ottformatiottal changes occur involving the nucleic acid and/or the enzyme. Ott t)he contrary. if the a,cceptor end is shacked, there is ample space on the protein surface for a simultjatteous interaction with the anticodon. (Yearly. t,he best way to solrr the problem would be the study of a crystalline complex of MetRS and tRNA"". In the absence of such c>rystals. solution experiments like those report'ed above are 01 great' value. Studies on the binding of t,RNAMet t0 Met RS by small-attgle tteutjroti scattering methods may also prove useful (Dessert ut ~1.. 1978 ; 1982). Fittall,v. while tnost of those studies were directed on the nucleic acid side, `k'ue Kr Schimmel (1977) have reported a procedure t'o isolat,e attd seyuettcae the peptide portions of an enzyme that are involved in F)hot,ocross-littkittg (see also Bruton. 1979). Similar st'udies on the Met,RS-t RNAMe' system would be of great) ht~lp. .jt this point,. it is worth noting that, one characteriAc* feature of the structure of MetRS is thra presence of a large depression located on one side of t)he molecule (Fig. 6(b)). which in t)he binding of t,he nucleic. acid (see Kim, 1975). This may possibly be involved h,vpothesis is under investigation.

Do all aminoacyl-t)RKA synthetases display similar &uctural features ! The yuestion is not) trivial since these enzymes are a highly heterogeneous family of molecules (see e.g. Schimmel 8r Silll. 1979). Their tnolec*ular weights range from and their quaternary stjructure from monomeric to - 50,000 to -380,000 tet,rameric. Some amittoary-t*RNA synthetases bind the amino acid only to the 2'. hydroxyl group of the t)erminal ribose of the tRNA. others ottly to the 3'.h,vdroxyl group, attd ot'hers amittoacylate eit,her the 2'. or t)he 3-hydroxyl group (Herht CC+ C'hittault, 1976: Sprinzl & Cramer. 1975). With respect to the reaction mechanism (e.g. the order of addit,iott of reac%attts. t'he ligattd affinity. the maximal velocity or t,he allosteric effects) (Aottspicuous variations have been observed between different synthetases (Ofengand, 1978). Moreover. no unique feature has beett fouttd so far in the recognition of tRNlls by their cogttate ligases : although the attticodott loop is frequently involved. this is not always the case (Goddard. 1977 : Schimmel. 1979). As already pointed out, the structure of MetRS is biglobular: the N-terminal globule, bearing the whole of the nucleotide binding domain. is linked by a sittgltl chain to the (`-terminal globule. Such a st,ructure may explain the behaviour ot` methiottyl-tRSA synthetase from H. stra~oth,urr~~oph,ilu.s towards proteolh-t,ic. digestion (Kalogerakos et ~1.. 1980). Like MetRS front E. ~061:. t)his enzyme c>an be converted into an active fragment of 64.000 molecular weight.

The caleavage of the 64,000 molecular w-eight derivative results in the loss of ettz.vmic: activity. but, the affinities for =\`I'1 and methiottitte remain unimpaired. This observation is cottsist,ettt with thtl

assumpt,ion that the tryptic cut occurs at the link between the two globules (arrows in Fig. 6); a. cleavage in this part' of the molecule would leave the "nucleotide binding domain" essentially intact and lead to the formation of t.wo fragmeflts of nearly equal size. A more detailed comparison can be made with tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from B. stearothermophdus. Note that this ligase is a "short dimer" (2 x 45,000) while native MetRS from E. coli is a "long dime?' (2 x 85,000). A refined model of tyrosyl-t,RNA synthetase described by Bhat et (xl. (Abstr. K,:,\lBO-FEBS Workshop. Strtrsbourg. 1980) also shows the presence of a chara,cteristic "Rossmann fold'. iti the N-terminal domain. As could be judged from the comparison of schematic, drawings depicting the structure of the t'wo synthetases, obvious and striking similarit,ies are observed in the central core; more part'icularly. the number and thla relative orientations of the /3-strands and n-helices building the "nucleot~ide binding domain" are quite similar. Moreover. t,he C-terminal domain is very rich in helices in both proteins. Thus it is probable that, despite the functional differences between different aminoacyl-t)R,NA synthetases, import'arrt structural homologies
exist ill all these enzymes.

Yote added in proof. A part of the gene coding for methionyl-tRNA synthetase has been cloned and sequenced by D. Barker (Institut de Biologic Moleculaire et Cellulaire, St,rasbourg, France). This partial gene happens to correspond almost exactly to the tryptic fragment studied here (564 amino acids). D. Barker kindly made his results available to us. Over the last few weeks we have thus busily compared the sequence with our electron density map. To this date (20 December 1981) residues l-160 and 200-240 have been fitted (the gap corresponds to a part of the map where the density is ill-defined). More specifically. this result confirms the position of the N-terminus and the presence of a Rossmann fold.
