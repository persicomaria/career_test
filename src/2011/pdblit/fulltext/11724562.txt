ABSTRACT: Ketopantoate reductase (KPR, EC 1.1.1.169) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ketopantoate to pantoate on the pantothenate (vitamin B5) biosynthetic pathway. The Escherichia coli panE gene encoding KPR was cloned and expressed at high levels as the native and selenomethioninesubstituted (SeMet) proteins. Both native and SeMet recombinant proteins were purified by three chromatographic steps, to yield pure proteins. The wild-type enzyme was found to have a KM(NADPH) of 20 µM, a KM(ketopantoate) of 60 µM, and a kcat of 40 s-1. Regular prismatic KPR crystals were prepared using the hanging drop technique. They belonged to the tetragonal space group P42212, with cell parameters: a ) b ) 103.7 Å and c ) 55.7 Å, accommodating one enzyme molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure of KPR was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using the SeMet protein, for which data were collected to 2.3 Å resolution. The native data were collected to 1.7 Å resolution and used to refine the final structure. The secondary structure comprises 12 R-helices, three 310-helices, and 11 -strands. The enzyme is monomeric and has two domains separated by a cleft. The N-terminal domain has an R -fold of the Rossmann type. The C-terminal domain (residues 170291) is composed of eight R-helices. KPR is shown to be a member of the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase C-terminal domain-like superfamily. A model for the ternary enzyme-NADPHketopantoate ternary complex provides a rationale for kinetic data reported for specific site-directed mutants.

Ketopantoate reductase (KPR,1 EC 1.1.1.169) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ketopantoate to pantoate as part of the pantothenate biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 1). Subsequently, pantoate is condensed with -alanine to form pantothenate, which is the precursor to the phosphopantetheine moiety in coenzyme A and acyl carrier protein. Only plants and microorganisms possess this pathway, so animals must obtain pantothenate (vitamin B5) in their diet. The pathway of pantothenate biosynthesis was elucidated in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium by bioThis work was supported by Astex Technology (Cambridge, U.K.), the BBSRC, the Pfizer Award for Innovation, Rhone Poulenc Agriculture, Ministerio Espanol de Educacion y Cultura, and The Oliver Gatty Trust. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

chemical and genetic experiments, and three of the four genes (panB, panC, and panD) were mapped close together on the E. coli genome (1, 2). The panE gene encoding KPR remained elusive, however, due in part to the fact that an enzyme of valine and isoleucine biosynthesis, acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase (AHIR, EC 1.1.1.86), encoded by ilVC, can catalyze the same reaction as KPR, albeit less efficiently. Mutants of ilVC still retain KPR activity, whereas ilVC panE double mutants have no measurable enzyme activity and are pantoate auxotrophs (3, 4). The panE gene from S. typhimurium has recently been shown to be allelic to the apbA gene (5). This gene, required for the function of the alternative pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, encodes an enzyme with KPR activity. Mutagenesis of the endogenous apbA gene in an ilVC background produced strains that required pantoate or pantothenate for growth and were devoid of KPR activity (6).

14494 Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 48, 2001 KPR has been purified and partially characterized from Pseudomonas maltophilia 845, and found to comprise three to five subunits with an Mr of 30 000 (7). In contrast, recombinant KPR from both S. typhimurium (5) and E. coli (8) are monomeric, with Mrs of 31 100 and 34 000, respectively. It has been reported that S. typhimurium KPR has a 3.8-fold higher specific activity with NADPH than with NADH (5). The recombinant E. coli enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the pro-S hydrogen from NADPH. The enzyme has an ordered bi-bi mechanism with initial binding of NADPH and, in contrast to AHIR, does not require divalent metal ions for catalysis (8). Several site-directed mutants have been characterized to determine their kinetic parameters, and to identify residues that are important in the catalytic mechanism (9). The involvement of Lys176 as a general acid or base and Glu256 in binding to the substrate was postulated. Mutations of each of these residues to alanine had significant deleterious effects on enzyme activity, and the double mutant was inactive. In this paper, we report the overexpression and purification of both native and selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted KPR from E. coli. These have been crystallized, and the X-ray structure of KPR has been determined to 1.7 Å resolution. The structure has been used to predict the binding site of NADPH and a model for the ternary complex. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning of the E. coli panE Gene. All molecular biological methods were as described (10), except where stated otherwise. The E. coli panE (apbA) gene sequence had been submitted to the EMBL database (accession number U34923), and this sequence is part of the plasmid pVJS78, which contains a 6 kb fragment of E. coli genomic DNA (obtained from T. Begley, Department of Chemistry, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). A PCR product, representing the full-length panE gene, was generated using primers EPANENdeF (5-ATACATATGAAAATTACCGTATTGGGATG-3) and EPANEBamHIR (5-TATGGATCCTCACCAGGGGCGAGGCAAACC-3), which had NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). This 915 bp PCR product was digested with an NdeI-BamHI fragment and ligated into an NdeI-BamHI-restricted pET24b vector (Novagen). The panE gene was sequenced and found to be identical to that in the database. Crude soluble protein extracts of the bacterial cells harboring pET24b-panE had measurable KPR activity (data not shown). Protein Expression and Purification. A 6 L culture of E. coli BL21 cells containing pET24b-panE was grown in LB medium containing kanamycin (50 µg/mL) at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6-0.7, and expression of KPR was induced by addition of isopropyl thio- -D-galactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The cells were harvested after 4 h and resuspended in extraction buffer containing 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged. Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of 5 mL protamine sulfate (2% w/v) and centrifugation. The supernatant was fractionated with solid ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate occurring between 5 and 40% saturation was collected by centrifugation. The protein was redissolved in 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA, dialyzed against 2 L of the

Matak-Vinkovic et al. ´ same buffer, concentrated to less than 10 mL of buffer containing 25 mM potassium chloride, and treated to fast phase liquid chromatography. First, the protein was applied to a Hiprep 16/10 Q XL anion exchange column and eluted with a linear 25 to 500 mM potassium chloride gradient. Fractions containing KPR were concentrated and desalted. The protein solution, in less than 10 mL of buffer containing 25 mM potassium chloride, was then applied to a Source 15Q XV 16/10 anion exchange column and eluted with a linear 25 to 500 mM potassium chloride gradient. Protein, in less than 5 mL of buffer, was then applied to a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column, and fractions containing KPR were concentrated to >5 mg/mL. The protein yield was 13 mg from 1 L of culture. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, according to the method of Laemmli (11). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and confirmed spectrophotometrically using A280 ( calculated) (12). N-Terminal sequencing determined the first nine residues to be MKITVLGCG, identical to the sequence predicted from the panE gene. Amino acid analysis (data not shown) was also consistent with that predicted from the gene. Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) was carried out on a VG BioQ quadrupole mass spectrometer. The mass of the protein, calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence (33 870 Da), compares well with the ESMS value (33 876 Da) determined for the recombinant protein. SeMet-substituted KPR was prepared as described by van Duyne et al. (13) by methionine pathway inhibition in the presence of SeMet (14). E. coli BL21 cells harboring pET24b-panE were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.35 in M9 minimal medium containing 4% glucose, 0.5% thiamine, and 100 mg/L kanamycin. The medium was then supplemented with six amino acids (Lys, Phe, Thr, Ile, Leu, and Val) and SeMet at 50 mg/L. Cells were induced using IPTG (100 mg/L) for 2.5 h and harvested. Purification of SeMet KPR was performed as described above, with the addition of 5 mM DTT to prevent oxidation of the SeMet. One milligram of SeMet protein was obtained from 1 L of cells. Determination of KPR ActiVity. KPR activity was determined at 37 °C in the forward direction by monitoring the decrease in the level of NADPH over time (as absorbance at 340 nm) by a modification of the method described in ref 7. The assay comprised 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 200 µM NADPH, and 30 nM KPR and was initiated with 500 µM potassium ketopantoate, in a final volume of 1 mL. Crystallization of KPR. Regular prismatic KPR crystals were prepared by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion technique, using 25-27% PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris (pH 9.4), and 0.200.25 M NaOAc as the precipitant solution. The protein concentration was 11 mg/mL in 10 mM Hepes (pH 8.0). The hanging drops, consisting of 1 µL of protein solution and 1 µL of well solution, were equilibrated at 4 °C for several days. Crystals with dimensions of 0.4 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm grew from clear drops. These belonged to the tetragonal space group P42212 with the following cell parameters: a ) b ) 103.7 Å and c ) 55.7 Å, accommodating one enzyme molecule per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 45%. The SeMet KPR crystals, prepared in a way similar to that of native KPR crystals, were obtained using two different

Experimental values of f  and f estimated from fluorescence spectra were used and refined during analysis. The resulting values are very similar to the theoretical values and are given in Table 1. Experimental phases were improved by solvent flattening using SOLOMON (16), via the SUSHI graphical user interface (19) with a solvent content of 43%. The final electron density map was easily interpretable, and the whole polypeptide chain was assigned on the basis of the initial electron density map. The polypeptide chain was fitted into the MAD electron density map using program O (20). Rounds of maximumlikelihood refinement with REFMAC (21) were alternated with visual inspection of electron density and manual rebuilding of side chains. Several rounds of simulated annealing with CNS (22) were included to refine the position of the main chain properly. The current model contains 291 residues and 272 water molecules. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OVerexpression and Purification of Recombinant E. coli KPR. The E. coli panE gene encoding KPR was cloned into the expression vector pET24b, and expressed to high levels (13 mg/L). Both native and SeMet-substituted recombinant proteins were purified by three chromatographic steps, to yield the pure protein. Electrophoresis in the presence of SDS revealed a protein of 33 kDa for both the wild-type and SeMet-substituted forms (data not shown), consistent with the predicted Mr, and that reported previously (8). The protein behaved as a monomer on gel filtration. The enzyme was found to have a KM(NADPH) of 20 µM, a KM(ketopantoate) of 60 µM, and a kcat of 40 s-1. The values reported by Zheng and Blanchard using different assay conditions (8) are 4 µM, 120 µM, and 8 s-1, respectively. Crystallization trials using both the hanging and sitting drop techniques were carried out with Hampton crystal screen 6, but initial crystals that were obtained were an irregular rocket shape. After optimization of the conditions as described in Materials and Methods, regular prismatic KPR crystals were prepared, which diffracted well. Structure Solution and Refinement. Initial phases were calculated by the MAD technique using three data sets collected at wavelengths on and away from the selenium KR absorption edge. After solvent flattening had been carried out, an easily interpretable electron density map was obtained at 2.3 Å resolution (Figure 1). Secondary structural elements were clearly defined in the electron density "bones" calculated with MAPMAN (23). The asymmetric unit consists of one KPR monomer. The main chain of the molecule was traced using secondary structure template building functionality in O (20), and the sequence was easily determined from the positions of selenium atoms from SHARP (19). The model was improved by restrained isotropic, maximumlikelihood refinement with REFMAC (21). Crystallographic refinement was alternated with manual model rebuilding in O (20). Torsional simulated annealing (starting temperature of 3000 K) in CNS was used to improve difficult parts of the model. Ordered water molecules were modeled by automated cycles of water addition and removal by ARP (24)

protein concentrations, 8 and 16 mg/mL. The SeMet KPR stock solution contained 15 mM Tris (pH 8) and 2 mM DTT to protect the Se atoms from oxidation. Optimized crystallization conditions include 28-38% PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris (pH 9.4), and 0.25 M NaOAc. Data Collection and Processing. The structure of KPR was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method using the SeMet derivative. Data to 2.3 Å resolution were collected at 100 K on the BW7A beamline at the EMBL outstation in DESY (Hamburg, Germany). Flash-freezing of the crystal was preceded by soaking for 30 s in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 15% glycerol, 30% PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris (pH 9.4), and 0.25 M sodium acetate. An X-ray fluorescence spectrum was recorded and used to select wavelengths for subsequent MAD data collection. Data were collected at the Se absorption edge e ) 0.979272 Å (12 661.00 eV), the absorption peak p ) 0.9790501 Å (12 663.77 eV), and at a remote reference wavelength r ) 0.885612 Å (14 000 eV). The diffraction data were indexed and integrated using the DENZO package (15). The three data sets were scaled to the remote data set using SCALA (16, 17), and structure factor amplitudes were calculated using TRUNCATE (16). Statistics of the processed data are listed in Table 1. The native data set was collected to 1.7 Å resolution at the Daresbury SRS beamline 9.6. A cryoprotectant solution contained 30% PEG1500, 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 9.4), 300 mM sodium acetate, and 20% glycerol. Structure Determination and Refinement. Six selenium sites were found with the program SHELXS96 (18) using direct methods and anomalous difference data of p SeMet. Data were phased with SHARP (19) using the data sets at three wavelengths, which also revealed two additional Se

and refinement by REFMAC. A final model containing 291 residues and 272 water molecules was refined to an R-factor of 0.230 and an Rfree of 0.289 (Table 1). The last 12 residues at the C-terminus were not visible in electron density maps. The quality of the model and its geometry were assessed by PROCHECK (25). There were no Ramachandran outliers, and 91.9% of the residues lie in the most favored regions of the plot. OVerall Structure of KPR. The secondary structure assignment of KPR, as analyzed using the DSSP program (26), shows the molecule to be constructed from 12 R-helices, three 310-helices, and 11 -strands. The enzyme is monomeric and has two domains separated by a cleft (Figure 2). The N-terminal domain has an R -fold of the Rossmann type and comprises residues 1-169. It is formed from a sevenstranded mixed -sheet with R-helices connecting adjacent parallel strands. One of the R-helices, R1, forms a core and sits in the concave face of the sheet. It is further enclosed by a four-stranded antiparallel -sheet that is joined to the ends of the seven-stranded -sheet by -arches or bridges. The sequence between the end of strand 1 and helix R1 contains a glycine-rich region, including the sequence GCGALG (residues 7-12), which represents the motif GXGXXG that is very often an indicator of the nucleotide binding site in dehydrogenases (27). The C-terminal domain (residues 170-291) is composed of eight R-helices. To identify other residues which might be important in the catalytic mechanism, database searches of bacterial genomes were carried out, and several putative KPRs were identified. However, except between the E. coli and S. typhimurium orthologues, which are 82% identical, the overall level of similarity between sequences was very low, at less than 30% on average. In the absence of experimental evidence that a particular gene encodes a protein with KPR activity, its assignment as a gene encoding the enzyme cannot be certain. Nevertheless, an alignment of 13 bacterial sequences identified a total of 16 completely conserved residues, compared to the 20 identified in seven bacterial KPR sequences by Zheng and Blanchard (8). The conserved residues, which include the GXGXXG motif, are all located in or close to the cleft between the two domains (Figure 2), with the notable exception of Glu210.

with a structure similar to that of KPR has identified five distant homologues: AHIR from spinach (31, 32), Trypanosoma brucei 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) (33), UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPGDH) from Streptococcus pyrogenes (34), human short chain L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) (35), and N-(1-D-carboxyethyl)-L-norvaline dehydrogenase (CENDH) from Arthrobacter sp. (36). Among these proteins, only the nucleotide binding site residues are conserved, and the overall level of sequence identity is e20%. All these proteins belong to the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase C-terminal domain-like superfamily from the SCOP database (37). SCOP defines the fold of the superfamily as a Rossmann fold N-terminal

The sequences are AHIR from spinach (31, 32), 6PGDH from T. brucei (33), UDPGDH from St. pyrogenes (34), SCHAD from humans (35), CENDH from Arthrobacter sp. (36), and KPR from E. coli.

domain with a family-specific C-terminal extension with a common core formed around two long antiparallel helices related by (pseudo) 2-fold rotation. A structural alignment of KPR and the five above members of the superfamily using the program COMPARER (38) and formatted using the JOY program (39) is shown in Figure 3. It reveals a relatively high degree of similarity in the N-terminal domain for the six proteins and a very low degree of similarity in the C-terminal domain. The level of identity and rmsd between KPR and AHIR, 6PGDH, UDPGDH, SCHAD, and CENDH for the whole molecule, the Nterminal domain, and the C-terminal domain are in Table 2. The alignment shows that CENDH is the protein most similar to KPR. The schematic representation of the secondary structure of SCHAD, KPR, and CENDH (Figure 4a), made with the help of the program HERA (40), shows the Rossmann fold in the N-terminal domain of all three proteins,

but reveals that there are some differences. KPR has one fewer -strands than the others at one edge of the sheet, whereas KPR and CENDH have an additional -sheet. The C-terminal domain in KPR is similar only to that in CENDH, where long helices in KPR correspond to several small helices in CENDH. In fact, a Dali search with this domain revealed no other proteins with a similar fold. Despite this high degree of structural similarity, KPR is a monomer whereas CENDH is a homodimer (subunit molecular weight of approximately 36 000) (30, 31), with the R-helical C-terminal domain providing the dimerization interface. Both enzymes bind R-keto acids, and the residues that are proposed to bind the substrate in KPR (see below), Ser244 and Glu256, are very close to Arg292 and Glu296, the residues that bind the substrate in CENDH (Figure 4b). In Figure 3, the active site residues in the five superfamily members and the proposed active site residues in KPR have been highlighted with circles. The nucleotide binding site GXGXX[GA] is present in all the proteins, and proposed active site residues of KPR are in positions similar to those of active site residues in the other proteins; e.g., Asn98, Ala122, and Arg124 are aligned in all the proteins except CENDH. Nucleotide Binding Site. The structural similarity between the N-terminal domains of KPR and human SCHAD enabled us to carry out molecular modeling to identify the cofactor binding site, since the structure of the binary complex of SCHAD with NAD+ has been determined (PDB entry 2hdh). The SCHAD structure was fitted to the KPR structure and

the NAD+ cofactor extracted from SCHAD to KPR. Water molecules clashing with the cofactor were removed and hydrogen atoms added to the model with the SYBYL Biopolymer module (Tripos, 1998) for force field optimization purposes. The NAD+ molecule was edited to NADPH and optimized as a substructure using the Tripos force field.

As a result of this process, the conformation of the pyrophosphate group of NADPH changed so that it now fitted better into the interdomain cleft (Figure 5a). Only side chains involved in interactions with the cofactor moved during geometry optimization. In the resulting model, NADPH is largely buried between two domains, with only the adenine moiety of NADPH partially exposed, and the nicotinamide portion of the cofactor anchored in place by hydrogen bonds to its ribose hydroxyl by the conserved residues, the Glu256 O 2 atom and the Asn98 main chain nitrogen atom (Figure 5b). In this model, the conserved residue Lys72 interacts with the pyrophosphate moiety through three hydrogen bonds, suggesting that this residue plays a major role in cofactor recognition. This observation is interesting, since Zheng and Blanchard (9) reported that a Lys72Ala mutant had wildtype enzyme activity in a crude cell free preparation, comparable to their Asp250Ala mutation, which is remote from the active site.

Structure of E. coli Ketopantoate Reductase Substrate Binding Site and Reaction Mechanism. Although the apoenzyme is in a more open conformation than would be expected for catalysis, it is still possible to identify key catalytic residues and those involved in binding ketopantoate. In particular, Lys176 and Glu256, which have previously been identified as being important in catalysis by site-directed mutagenesis (9), are located near the putative NADPH site, some distance apart, and could accommodate ketopantoate between them. From knowledge of the stereochemical course of the reaction, in which the proS hydrogen of NADPH is delivered to the si face of ketopantoate (8), and when the expected geometry for hydride transfer is considered, it is possible to construct two models for the ternary complex. In one, the carbonyl group of ketopantoate points away from the nitrogen of the dihydronicotinamide ring, but this introduces unfavorable steric interactions between the gem dimethyl group on ketopantoate and the C-3 primary amide on the dehydronicotinamide ring. In the alternative structure (Figure 5b) (after some slight adjustment of the side chains of these residues and a larger movement of Lys176), there is the potential for good hydrogen bonding of Lys176 and Asn98 to the hydroxyl group of ketopantoate, and of Ser244 to the carboxyl. Furthermore, Glu256 could act as the acid to protonate the developing negative charge on ketopantoate as hydride is delivered from NADPH, albeit relayed through the C-3 hydroxyl of the ribose. All four of these residues are conserved. CONCLUSION KPR plays a key step in the biosynthesis of pantothenate, and as such is a potential herbicide and antimicrobial target. From the structure of the apoenzyme, it has been possible to construct models of the holoenzyme and the ternary complex, and suggest a catalytic mechanism. While the proposed structures appear to be reasonable, there are inherent uncertainties in any such models, and consequently, attempts to obtain crystal structures of these complexes are presently underway. Our results confirm the importance of Lys176 and Glu256 in binding ketopantoate and in the catalytic mechanism, although that the precise roles differ from those suggested by Zheng and Blanchard (9).
