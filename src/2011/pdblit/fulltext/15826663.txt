An IgM(K) immunoglobulin from a patient (Pot) with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia was hydrolyzed with pepsin to release a fragment consisting of the `variable' (V) domains of the light and heavy chains plus eight residue `tails' from the `Fonstant' (C) domains. The crystal structure of this fragment was determined at 2.3 A resolution by molecular replacement and crystallographic refinement methods. When examined separately, the light chain component closely resembles another human ICchain (Rei) in both the p-pleated sheet, regions and the `hypervariable' loops. The conserved pleated sheets in the heavy chain are similar to those in the human Kol IgGl protein, but the third hypervariable loop in particular is different from that in any immunoglobulin structure described to date. As in the Kol protein, this loop blocks the access to any internal active site along the light-heavy chain interface. Unlike the Kol protein, however, the loop does not protrude beyond the boundaries of a conventional antigen combining site. Instead, it forms a very compact structure, which fills almost all residual space between the domains. This is an example of one dominant complementarity-determining region (CDR) essentially negating the diversity possible with five other CDRs in the two chains. Ordered water molecules are associated with light chain constituents along the interface, but not with CDR3 of the heavy chain. In screening exercises the Pot IgM failed to bind a wide variety of peptides. Together, the results suggest that ligand binding can only occur on external surfaces of the protein. These surfaces carry a limited number of side chains usually assigned to CDRs in more typical antibodies. Keywords: IgM immunoglobulin; 1. Introduction The malignancy responsible for Waldenstrom's originates from the B-cell macroglobulinemia lineage in the bone marrow. Mature antibodysecreting B cells (plasma cells) from the dominant clone can produce sufficiently large quantities of IgM immunoglobulins to increase the viscosity of the serum of the blood to very high levels.

cases the IgM molecules form cold-induced (cryo-) precipitates, which may lead to petechiae in peripheral tissues, especially in cold climates. Such proteins were detected in patients with multiple myeloma as early as 1933 (Wintrobe & Buell) and were subsequently categorized as cryoglobulins (Lerner et al., 1947). IgM molecules are the most although IgG, TgA common cryoimmunoglobulins, and Bence-Jones proteins may also show this tendency (Klein et al., 1977; Middaugh & Litman, 1977). Immunoglobulins account for most of the cryoprecipitates in serum, but other prot,eins can be included in this category (e.g. C-reactive proteins, protein-albumin complexes and cryofibrinogens; Grey & Kohler, 1973; Laurence & Nachman, 1981). Precipitates of cryoimmunoglobulins may consist of 188

Structure qf an ZgM Pv monoclonal proteins alone (as in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia or multiple myeloma), monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies associated with polyclonal IgG immunoglobulins (immune complex diseases) or a mixture of polyclonal antibodies. If cryoimmunoglobulins are generally monoclonal, detectable as flocculent or gelatinous precipitates in serum within 24 hours at 4°C. Cryoprecipitation of immunoglobulins from serum may polyclonal require several days at 4°C. The process is usually reversible, although some cryoprecipitates remain insoluble even if heated to 35°C (Laurence & Nachman, 1981). Mechanisms for most examples of cryoprecipitation are not well understood. As part of the treatment of some patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, the high viscosity of the blood is periodically relieved by plasmapheresis. The plasma, which would otherwise be discarded, provides an invaluable source of a monoclonal IgM antibody in large quantities. Among many of these proteins which we have screened, one immunoglobulin has particularly favourable properties for structural studies. This protein (designated as Pot IgM) is available in gramme quantities and behaves like a classical cryoimmunoglobulin (Axiak, 1986). At temperatures below about 20°C the Pot IgM forms a flocculent precipitate, which readily redissolves at 37°C. The cryoprecipitation is sensitive to concentration of the protein and the pH and ionic strength of the aqueous solution containing the protein. Maximal precipitation (95%) at 4°C occurs when the protein concentration is 2 mg/ml, the pH is in the range of 7.2 to 89 and the ionic strength is approximately equivalent to that of serum (Axiak, 1986). Cryoprecipitation is inhibited in 1.0 iw-NaCl, but not at concentrations below 92 M. These findings are of practical importance in our structural study because it is possible to purify ample quantities of the Pot IgM by repeated cycles of cryoprecipitation and dissolution under the above conditions. It is interesting that the cryoproperty is manifest only by the secreted pentameric form of the Pot IgM. Monomeric IgM, prepared by mild reduction and alkylation of the pentameric form, fails to precipitate even on prolonged storage (> 1 week) at 4°C in concentrations of 1.5 mg/ml (Axiak, 1986). Enzymatically produced fragments, such as the Fv, Fab, Fc and (Fe),, also remain soluble when placed at 4°C. This combination of properties, namely the cryoprecipitability for purification of the pentamer and the solubility of the fragments, allowed us great latitude in selecting a suitable product for X-ray diffraction studies and to survey a wide range of conditions in developing an optimal crystallization system. The Fv fragment is soluble in concentrations > 100 mg/ml and is readily amenable to crystallization in PEG 6OOt.

system to produce Fv crystals of different shapes and sizes is described in another article (Shan et al., 1992). Elucidation of the0 three-dimensional structure of the Pot Fv at 2.3 A (1 A = 10-i nm) resolution is the subject of the present report. As released from the Pot IgM by the action of pepsin, the fragment consists of the `variable' (V) domains of the light and heavy chains (the strict definition of Fv) plus the first eight residues from the `constant' (C) domains (Shan et al., 1992). Amino acid sequence analyses (Shari & Gray, unpublished data) of the K-type light chain indicates that it belongs to subgroup 1 (Kabat et al., 1991). The heavy chain V domain can be included in subgroup III. Preliminary results indicated that the third complementarity-determining region (CDRS) and the adjacent fourth framework region (FR4) might be truncated in comparison wtih more t'ypical heavy chains. When the gene sequence corresponding to the Vu domain was subsequently examined, however, the deduced amino acid sequence included 12 residues for CDR3 and all residues expected for an intact FR4 (Raison et a,l., unpublished data). Inadvertently, we were faced with the necessity of arbitrating between the t,wo sets of results through interpretation of the electron density maps. The testing of alternative interpretations work was one of the most interesting parts of the

to be presented. Recent complet,ion of the amino acid sequence analyses clearly negated the assumption of shortened CDR3 and FR4 segments. All three sets of results are now in agreement:
another testament to the value of a multi-

disciplinary

approach.

2. Materials and Methods
(a) Isolation and crystallization of th,e Pot F1: fragment Procedures for the preparation and purification of the Pot IgM and it's `Fv' fragment (Fv plus 8 residue tails)

will be described in other articles (Shan & Gray, unpublished data; Raison et al., unpublished data). Briefly, the
IgM immunoglobulin was isolated from serum by cryoprecipitation at 4°C. The protein was centrifuged and the pellet was dissolved at pH 7 and 37°C in 905 Mphosphate+15 M-NaCl (phosphate buffered saline, PBS). Contaminating proteins were removed by repeated cycles of cryoprecipitation at 4°C and solubilization of pelleted IgM at 37°C. Fv was liberated from the IgM molecule by the action of pepsin at pH 4.5 and 4°C for 3 days. The Fv was purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl 200 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) and by chromatofocusing. Crystals were obtained by a microseeding procedure coupled with vapour diffusion techniques with hanging or sitting drops (Shan et al.. 1992). From a variety of crystal

forms, which could be prescribed by alterations in the
crystallizing conditions, we selected large polyhedrons shaped like truncated bipyramids. Growt)h conditions optimal for production of these crystals included a concentration of Fv of about 80 mg/ml. 24 to 25% (V/V) of PEG 600 in 902 M-Tes (pH 6%) and a temperature of 20 to 22°C. Bipyramids with pointed ends (the equilibrium shape), produced at lower concentrations of PEG 600, and crystals grown at higher supersaturation levels (variants of skeletal crystals) were also subjerted t,o X-ray analysis.

Angles from the search wit,h the 5539 probes were refined with the rotation function of Lattman and JAove (program again excerpted from the MERLOT package). Translation searches with the program RTMAP, written by one of us (X.-m. H.). were then conducted to position the ,J539 components into t,he Pot unit cell. Again the three probes were V, , ITH and the V,-V, pairs. To distinguish between the enantiomorphi($ space groups, P4,2,2 and 1'432,2. correlation searches were performed for both possibilities and compared. After rotation, t,ranslation and assignment to the correct space group, the VL and V, domains were subjected to rigid body refinement with the program CORELS (Herzbrrg B Sussman. 1983). (d) Rejhement

(b) Collection

of X-ray diffraction data

The Pot Fv crystalliqes in the tetragpnal space group 1'432,2,, with a = 43.7 A and c = 212.2 A. In the unit cell there are 8 Fv molecules, with one V,-V, heterodimer as the asymmetric unit. The molecular weights of the V, and V" components of the heterodimer total 26462. Protein molecules therefore occupy 1.93 A3/Da with the solvent accounting for only 365% of the volume of the unit, cell (Matthews, 1968). Two sets of X-ray diffraction data were used to solve the structure of the fragment,. one collected with a Nicolet I'21 diffract*ometer and the second with a Siemens area detector. With the diffractometer, nickel-filtered Cu Kr radiation was generated from a sealed tube operated at 40 kV and 35 mA. To accentuate the separation of closely spaced reflections, particularly those parallel to the c axis, diffracted rays were directed through a helium filled tube to a detector 52 cm from the crystal, In addition, omega step scans (Wyckoff et al., 1967) were used to restrict the intensity measurements to the upper halves of the peaks where there were little or no overlaps of adjacent reflections. Despite all precautions it was clear that we were approaching the limit of resolut,ion possible with the instrumentation. xevertheless, 5379 unique reflections (881% complete) could be measured in the range of 20 to 2.7 A from a single crystal. All reflections with intensities (I)> 1.5 a(I), where u is the standard deviation based on counting statistics. were retained in the data set. The Siemens area detector was mounted on a 3-axis goniostat at a distance of 25 cm from the crystal. A cone filled with helium was fitted into the space between the crystal and detector. Cu Kcc radiation was provided by a Siemens rotating anode operated at 35 kV and 100 mA. The X-ray beam was collimated to a width of @3 mm. The exposure time for each frame was 90 s and the frame width was 0.2". The data set included a total of 3150 frames: 2000 with the c axis of the crystal parallel with the spindle and 1150 frames perpendicular to this orientation. Only one crystal was required because there were no indications of decay during the 80 h period of data collection. All data were processed on a VAX 3100 workstation with the XENGEN package of programs (Howard et aE., 1987). (c) Determination of the crystal structure

Retaining the same0 model and using diffractometer data from 20 A to 2.7 A, the R-factor reduced to 0325 bJ restrained least-squares refinement with the program PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1981; Hendrickson, 1985). The amino acid sequences of the ,J539 domains were then changed to those of the Pot Fv (Shan & Gray, unpublished data; Raison et al., unpublished data). In succession, two sequences of CDR3 of the heavy chain were employed, although the exploratory studies were con+cted p!edominantly with the shorter version. With 60 A to 2.7 A data, cycles of refinement with PROLSQ were alternated with model building on an Evans and Sutherland PS300 with the program FRODO (Jones, 1978; Pflugrath et al., 1984). Diffractometer data were then replaced with a set collected with a Siemens area detector s and the resolution was extended to 2.3 A. Refinement was continued by simulated annealing with the program X-PLOR (Briinger et al., 1987, 1989) and model building was carried out on a Silicon Graphics IRIS 4D/80GT with the program TOM (Cambillau & Oatley, 1987). Individual temperature (B) factors were calculated and 147 water molecules were assigned to electron density modules in F,-F, maps. Finally, the stereochemistry was idealized with the program PROLSQ. A Luzzati (1952) plot was used to determine the mean error in the atomic co-ordinates. which have been deposited with the Brookhaven Dat'a Bank and are available directly from t'he authors on request until they have been processed and released (Bernstein et al.. 1977). (e) Assignments of solvent
positions

The structure of Pot Fv was solved at 2.3 .& resolution by molecular replacement (Rossmann & Blow, 1962; Lattman & Love, 1970; Crowther, 1972; Fitzgerald, 1988; Rossmann, 1990). Possible starting models were screened with Crowther's rotation function program, taken from 1988). V, and VH the MERLOT package (Fitzgerald, domains, alone or in combination, were selected from the crystal structures of human Fabs New and Kol (Saul et a?.. 1978; Marquart et al., 1980) and the murine Fabs McPC603 and 5539 (Satow et al., 1986; Suh et al., 1986). Four shells of X-ray diffraction- da@ wer: tes!ed pith th,e rotationQfunctipn program: 10 A4 A, 8 A-4. A, 8 A45 A and 10 A-45 A. A Patterson radius of 23 A was used in all calculations. The most convincing rotation function maps for individual domains were obtained with 5539. With this starting model, the highest peaks in the maps for the VH and V, domains corresponded to the correct rotation angles. When individual Kol domains were used, the correct solutions were associated with the second

Water molecules were assigned to modules of electron density consistently appearing in F,-F, difference maps after refinement of the protein structure. Selection of these peaks was restricted to the space within 5 A distance of protein constituents, as in previous studies (Ely et al., 1989). In general, the assignments were accepted if the temperature (B) factors were below 25 A' and if the water molecules were in reasonable proximity to oxygen or nitrogen atoms on the protein. Hydrogen bonds were designated as probable when the water and appropriate protein atoms were separated by distances of <3.2 A.

resolution almost 98 "/b of the possible reflections were observed with 1>0*50(1). The average redundancy is about five observations per unique reflection and the Rmerge is 4;6%. TntFnsities gradually become weaker from 3.5 A to 2.3 A but the percentage of observed re!ections falls below 800,b only in the last shell (2.t A to 2.3 A). Crystals diffract to d spacings of 1.9 A, but the Rmerge values are not acceptable at, this resolution (presumably because of the large c unit cell dimension). The results of the applications of the rotation and translation functions are summarized in Table 2. In the rotat,ion function vaps (Crowther, 1972) peaks obtained with 10 A-4 A data for individual V, and VH domains were also observed when the V, -V, pair was used as starting model (top panel). VJ wa! a more satisfactory probe than V, and the 10 A-4 A data were generally preferable t'o other sets. The final rotation angles obtained by the procedure of & Love (1970) are listed in the second Lattman panel from the top. Results of the translation searches for each of the possible enantiomorphic space groups are presented in the third panel. With all three probes (V,, VH and VL-V, pair) the correlation coefficients were significantly higher and the R values were slightly lower for the P4,2,2 space group. In the results for the alternative space group, note also that the maximum peak is found in a different locat,ion for each probe. Finally, the results of rotating and translating individual domains in six-dimensional searches are presented in the bottom panel. Models in orientations specified with the program RTMAP were subjected to rigid body

refinement with the prograOm C~REIS. As the Table shows, the R-factor for 15 A-4 A data was 0.483 at this stage of the analysis. Important steps in the refinement are summarized in Table 3. Variations of the R-factor in different shells of data are shown in Table 4 and statistics from the final step in the refinement are presented in Table 5. After idealization of the stereochemistry the R-factor wa! 0201 for data (8225 unique reflections) in the 8 A-2.3 w shell. A Luzzati plot iadicated a mean error in the coordinates of 025 A. The 4, $ (Ramachandran & 1968; Callahan et al., 1990) plot for Sasisekharan. the main-chain dihedral angles is given in Figure 1. Only seven of 244 residues in the final model have unfavourable dihedral angles. Three (1,109, 1,113 and HI 15) of t'hese correspond to regions of weak electron density in the tails of the domains.

Figure 1. 4. $ plots for the main-chain dihedral angles for the Pot Fv (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968). The calculations and maps were made with the program PAP (Callahan et nl.. 1990). Areas corresponding to allowed dihedral angles are indicated by solid line boundaries. Angles for glycine, which has no side-chain, are represented by crosses: all other amino acid residues are designated by squares. Most angles fall near or within the boundaries characteristic of p-pleated sheets (upper left) or right handed a-helices (middle left). Outliers other than glycine appearing in forbidden regions (lower left and right) indicate residues for which the electron density patterns are difficult to interpret. The latter are located on turns or on the `tails' of the domains.

amino acid sequences listed in Figure 3 and correlated with secondary structures by comparisons with Figure 6. In general these plots follow expected patterns. Residues not interacting with other protein constituents tend to have higher B values, e.g. the COOH-terminal tails of both domains (far right' in Fig. 2) and the N-terminus of the heavy chain (far left). The large loops corresponding to CDRs (Fig. 3) are well defined in the crystal structure and their constituents have B values well within the normal range of fluctuations. (b) Amino acid sequences of the V, and V, domains

Sequences of the Pot light and heavy chain V domains and their C domain tails (Shan & Gray, unpublished data; Raison et al., unpublished data) are presented in Figure 3. Sequences of the V domains of a human K-type light chain (Palm & Hilschmann, 1975) and a human y-type heavy chain (Schmidt et al., 1983) are included for comparison. Formally, the tails of the Pot structures can be considered to begin at the ends of the Rei and Kol sequences. In the three-dimensional structures, however. residues 107-109 in the light chain and

I I2 and 1 I3 in the heavy chain also protrude from the main bodies of the Pot domains. Historically, there have been two heavy chain sequences to be considered. The first is an amino acid sequence determined by analyses of' tryptic peptides from a highly purified sample of the Vn domain plus the tail (Shan & Gray, unpublished data). Lymph node cells were later isolated from the patient and a nucleotide sequence was det,ermined for the region corresponding to V, (R'aison et al.. unpublished data). Residues l-94 could be identified in both the peptide and nucleic acid sequences. In the next two positions (95 and 96) codons for hi&dine and arginine are present in the nucleotide sequence but the predicted dipeptide has not as yet been found among the tryptic product*s. Until recently, the peptide sequence for residues 97-105 was also in doubt. The net effect of the apparent differences was to shorten the combined CDRQ and FR4 regions by eight residues. When this shortened version was included in exhaustive model building exercises and subsequent refinement against the X-ray data, there were always extra modules of electron density in and around the regions assigned to CDR3 and FR4. One of the modules was sufficiently large to accommodate a trisaccharide and we thought that the Fv might be a glycoprotein. In a subsequent test, however, the heavy chain component failed to stain for carbohydrate after electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (Zacharius et al., 1969). The additional residues predicted by the nucleic acid sequence readily accounted for the `extra' modules of electron density. When the larger model was subjected to refinement, the changes noted in the structure of Fv were strictly localized to CDR3 and FR4 of the heavy chain. As further checks, the alternative models were refined against two other X-ray data sets. Again the results were consist,ent only with the longer version of the heavy chain. These exercises proved to be good tests for the validity of the crystal structure, as we did not know at the time whether the amino acid and nucleotide sequences would eventually come into register. There is one discrepancy where the X-ray analyses do not distinguish between two choices: tyrosine versus aspartic acid in position H99. The electron density is sufficiently large to represent tyrosine or a hydrated side-chain of aspartic acid. The residue was built as tyrosine pending further investigation. Comparisons of the sequences with those of other indicate the following gene types immunoglobulins for the Pot Fv protein: V,l and `JK1 for the light chain and V,3, ($52 (D) and J,5 for the heavy chain (K. Victor, V. Pascual, L. Curayannopoulos and J. D. Capra, personal communication). Both V regions are highly mutated relative to germline genes; the J gene of the light chain is mutated. but the corresponding heavy chain gene is not; the D gene is germline, but clipped. It is not uncommon for a mutated V, domain to be associated with a non-mut!ated ,J segment, particularly in view of the

For the light chain the computer numbering is identical to t,he numbering system of Kabat et nl. (1991), as presented in Fig. I. For the heavy chain, the numbering systems are the same for residues l-52; from 53 to 83, subtract one from the computer numbering to obtain the Kabat numbers; from 84 to 100, subtract 4; from 101 t,o the end. subtract 8.

(c) Quality of electron density maps
A stereo diagram of a section of an F,-- elecFC tron density map for the light chain V domain is shown in Figure 4 (top). The sequence of residues 31-38 represents the end of CDRl (Asn-Tyr-LeuAla, top to bottom) and the first part of FR2 (TrpTyr-Cln-Gin). Tyr L32, Ala L34, Tyr L36 and Gin I,38 form part of the interface with the heavy chain: Tyr L32 and Ala L34 are accessible and could participate in a combining site. An example of an F,,- map for the heavy chain FC is presented in Figure 4 (middle). Skeletal models for residues H94-HlOO (Lys-His-Arg-Val-Ser-TyrVal from bottom to top) are co-displayed with the cage electron density. The closeness of fit of these side-chains to the electron density argues strongly for the longer version of CDR3 (see preceding section). Side-chains of His H95, Tyr H99 and Val HI00 face the light chain and are potential constituents of an active site. Lys H94, Arg H96, Val (d) General features of the model A stereo diagram of the a-carbon model of the Pot Fv is shown in the upper panel of Figure 5. The CDR loops are at the top of the model and the `tails' are at the bottom. From the V,-V, interface outward the CDRs are arranged in the order of 3; 1 and 2. Note that the CDR,3 loops of the two domains cross at the top and the loops containing residues L40-L44 and H41-H45 cross at the bottom. The large space between the two sets of a-carbon atoms is illusory. Side chains interact across the interface (see next section) and access to the entrance is blocked by CDR3 of the heavy chain. There are several water molecules that can be identified in this channel (see Fig. 9) but ligands of almost any size are likely to be excluded. Antigen binding therefore is probably limited to the outer surfaces of the hypervariable loops of the Fv.

Assignments of hydrogen bonds, represented by dashed lines, were based on the distance criterion that the Gonor and acceptor atoms were separated by <3.2 A. In general the hydrogen bonds occur between antiparallel strands but there are short stretches of such interactions between parallel strands (e.g. at lower left of Fig. 6).

The three CDRs are marked by solid lines over the appropriate segments. Sequences of the human Rei K-type light chain (Palm & Hilschmann, 19'75) and the Kol y-type heavy chain fragments (Kratzin et al., 1989) are listed below the Pot sequences. Differences are designated by shading of the one-letter codes. Three-dimensional structures of the Pot components are compared with the Rei and Kol V domains in Fig. 5. The sequence presented for residues 95-104 of the heavy chain is derived from a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the D (`diversity') and J (`joining') minigenes (Raison et al., unpublished data).

This sequence is compatible

To compare the tertiary structures of the most' conserved parts of the `immunoglobulin fold`. 38 a-carbon atoms from the B-pleated sheets of the Pot light chain were superimposed on their counterparts in other proteins with the program ROTMOL (kindly furnished by W. Steigemann and R. Huber). These atoms correspond to residues 4-6, 19-24, 33-38. 6366, 7&75, 84-90 and 98-103. In the comparisons with both the human Rei (Epp et al., 1975; Palm & 1975) and murine BV04-01 (Herron et Hilschmann, al., 1891) x-chains, the (r.m.s.) deviations were only @41 A for the positions of corresponding pairs of atoms. The deviations were slightly higher when the Pot light chain was compared with the human Kol (Marquart et al., 1980; Kratzin et aZ.,O1989) and Meg (Ely et al., 1989) 1 chains (0.48 A and 0.56 A). Similar analyses were performed with the heavy chain u-carbons from residues 3-7, 18-25, 35-39, 68-72, 77-82, 89-93 and lO&lOQ. The Kol heavy chain from the human subclass IgGl and the BV04-01 heavy chain from the murine sujclass IgG2b gave r.m.s. deviations of only 0.31 A and @47 A. These results add to the evidence that V, domains from IgG and IgM antibodies can have very similar core structures. In Figure 5 (lower panel) the VL and V, domains are disengaged from the Pot Fv and superimposed on the corresponding domains of the Rei light chain and Kol heavy chain. The tertiary structure of the Pot light chain is remarkably similar to that of the Rei protein, even in the conformations of the t#hree CDRs (in the order of CDR2, 1 and 3, left to right at the top).

(lomparisons of sequences (see Fig. 3) indicate that t,he t,hree CDRs of Pot and Rei V, domains have the same length. Of the total of 16 substitutions, eight' involve constituents of these CDRs. Key residues for potential interactions with antigens are generally either duplicated or replaced conservaCvely (e.g. residues 32 in CDRl, 50 in CDR2 and 89, 91 and 96 in CDR3). In contrast the V, domains of Pot a,nd Kol differ in 51 positions, of which 30 are associated with the CDRs. Substitutions in four of the five residues of CDRl (especially positions 31, 33 and 35) may account for the differences in these loops. As there are t,en interchanges in 17 positions. it is difficult to explain why the t'ertiary structures of the CDR2s are so similar. In the (`DR3s all

residues except one are different and the Pot segment' is five residues shorter than that of Kol. Moreover. the Kol loop is cross-linked by a disulfide bond between residues IOOa and f.

When the 38 z-carbons from the p-pleated sheets of VL (see preceding section) were superimposed on the the V, domain with the program ROTMOL. domains were found to be related by a pseudotwofold angle of rotation of 17.5". This value compares favourably with those of other V pairs with good pseudo-twofold symmet'ry. For example,

In the sandwich st,ructure of each domain there are two antiparallel B-pleated sheets. identified here as the 4and 5-stranded layers. The last few residues of t,he N-terminal segment are roughly parallel t,o the segment of each domain and form hydroWOH-terminal gen bonds with its backbone atoms (lower left). In the V, domain residues 9-13 are also aligned antiparallel to the corresponding segment in a symmetry related light chain in the crystal lattice (see lower panel of Fig. 7). Backbone atoms not involved in intradomain interactions with the (POOH-terminal segment, namely the amide group of Ser 1`9. the carbonyl oxygen of 8er LlO and both the amide group and carbonyl oxygen of Ser 12, form hydrogen bonds with the antiparallel segment of the symmetry related light chain.

the values obtained for the Kol (Marquart rl al., 1980), 5539 (Suh rt al., 1986), McPC603 (Satow et al., 1986), HV04-01 (Herron rt al., 1991), Hed 10 (Cygler et al., 1987) and Meg light chain dimer (Ely et al., 1989) were l68", 170". 173", 174". 176" and 180 ". respectively. If the V,-V, pair in the Pot Fv is superimposed as a unit, on the Kol V,:V, pair, the r.m.s. difference is still only 063 A in the positions of 76 a-carbon atoms (38 from each domain). Stereo diagrams of the superposed proteins (not shown) indicate that the quaternary structures are quite similar despite the A-type light chain of Kol. With its K-chain, t,he BV04-01 Fv region resembles the Pot protein even more closely in quaternary strutture (r.m.s. deviation of 0.58 A in atomic positions). Like the first and third hypervariable loops of the Kol heavy chain, the CT)Rs of the Kol light chain and the BV04-01 light and heavy chains are significantly different from those of the Pot Fv. To obtain further measures of the similarities in the quaternary structures, the V,-V, pairs of the Kol and RV04-01 were first overlaid on the Pot Fv t'o produce the best average fit as before. Individual

domains were then treated as cylinders (I+~dmundsc~rr al., 1975; Herron et al.. 1991) and wert rotattad and translated to determine what additional IrIOVt'~ ments were required to provide more rxacst super position. These movements were divided into iI swivel of t'he cylinder in a horizontal planc~, ii `barrel' roll about the long axis and a cant in tht, vertical direction. For the Kol V, : the swivel, roll and cant angles were026", 0.41" and 2.5" and t,he translation was 0.31 A t,o achieve optimal overlap with the Pot V, . The corresponding angles for t,hr Kol V, were 0.?7", 4.1' and @45" and the translat,ion was 0.28 A. With the BVO4-01 irL, t~hr three: angles were l.Sy, 22" and 0.40" and the translation was only 0.05 A. For the HV04-01 V,. thca angles was were 1.1 ", 2.9" and 0.21 " and the t,ranslation 009 A. Thus in the Kol protein, swivel and cant motions of the light chain and a barrel roll of the heavy chain were necessary to approximate the l'ot Fv, while swivel and barrel roll motions of' both domains were required for superposition of RV04-01. The relatively small angular adjustments and translations confirm the visual impressions that structures of the t.hree V dimers arc the quaternary very similar. When compared at the z-carbon level. therefore, the three quaternary structures appear to be insensitive to variations in the sequences and tertiary structures of the hypervariable loops. Along t.he V,-V, boundary of the Pot Fv t,here are 92 pairs of atoms in posit&s suitable for interactions to stabilize the quaternary st rucbre.

(:l)K3 components account for 36 contacts: Gin L89 (two), Tyr I,91 (seven), Asn I,93 (four). Leu I,94 (three). l'ro I,95 (three) and Leu L96 (seven). Phe I,98 (eight) of FR4 terminat>es this string of residues which are so closely juxtaposed to the heavy chain. In the heavy chain FKB constituents are also interactions, the dimerization prominent in although less numerous (16) than in the light, chain. As in the Meg light chain dimer (Ely et al.. 1989), two equivalent glutamine side chains (138 and H39) form at least one hydrogen bond across t'he interface (measured distances betw~~rn the appropriate pairs of carboqyl oxygens and amide nitrogens are 2% A and 3.4 A). The side-chain of Leu H4.5 impinges on both Pro I,44 and Phe I,98 and the latter makes
et

Structure of an IgM Fv contact with the polypeptide backbone at Leu H45. Similarly, the side-chain of Trp H47 extends to the polypeptide backbone at Pro L95 and Leu L96. Apart from two van der Waals contacts between Asp H58 of CDR2 with Leu L94 and two between Tyr H91 and Gln L38 and Lys L42, all remaining interactions involving the heavy chain are localized in CDR3 and FR4: Arg H96 (nineteen), Val HlOO (one), Leu HlOOa (six), Thr HlOOb (five), Gly HlOOc (five), Phe HlOOd (ten), Trp H103 (twenty) and Gly H104 (one). One of the most interesting sets of interactions is centered around Arg H96. The NH1 atom makes an ion pair with the carboxyl group of Glu L55 (distances between NH1 and the two carboxyl oxygens are 27 A and 3.0 A). The NH2 atom is within hydrogen bonding distance (31 A) of the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine L49. These polar interactions hold the side-chains in close proximity and thus facilitate numerous van der the hydrophobic interactions among Waals portions. When considered as a group, the interactions of residues HlOO, HlOOa through to HlOOd and HlOl are worthy of special notice. The polypeptide backbone of this entire segment is sufficiently exposed to permit the close approach of V, side chains. For example, the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Val HlOO and Thr HlOOb are in contact with the side-chain of Leu L96 and the carbonyl and a-carbons of Leu HlOOa are approached by Tyr L91. The backbone atoms of Thr HlOOb and Gly HlOOc are within van der Weals contact distances of side-chain atoms of Gln L89 and Tyr L91. A hydrogen bond (measured distance 2.9 A) is formed between the carbonyl oxygen of Thr HlOOb and the amide group of Gln L89. The phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr L36 is also near the backbone at Gly HlOOc and may even be hydrogen bonded (distance of 3.0 A) to the amide nitrogen of Phe HlOOd. The carbonyl oxygen of Phe HlOOd and the a-carbon of Asp HI 01 are both in contact with atoms of Leu L46. R,eciprocally, the side-chain of Leu H 1OOa extends to the backbone atoms of Tyr L91 and also interacts with the side chains of Tyr L91 and Leu L94. Collectively, there are 20 interatomic contacts involving the backbone atoms in the heavy chain CDRS, as compared with a total of 14 in the entire light chain V domain. Several other types of interactions seal the interface of the two domains. At the end of CDRS,

199

Phe HlOOd touches the tips of the Leu L96 and Phe L98 side chains. Through other atoms in its sidechain, Phe L98 contacts the backbone and sidechain of Leu H45. Trp H103 occupies a large amount of space and interacts with the side-chain of Tyr L36, the ring of Pro L44 and the backbone at Pro L44 and Leu L46. To illustrate how tight the packing is at the bottom of the interface, the carbonyl oxygen of Gly H104 is in contact with the b-carbon of Ala L43. The importance of the quaternary structure will become more evident in the discussions of the effects of the dimerization interactions on the size and shape of the active site. (h) Crystal packing Stereo diagrams illustrating the crystal packing of Fv molecules are presented in Figure 7. These views were chosen to emphasize that the dominant packing relations involve pairs of Fv fragments. There are three principal types of arrangements: (1) antiparallel stacking of the first two segments of the four-stranded /?-pleated sheets of light chains in adjacent Fvs (see Fig. 6); (2) juxtaposition of the N-terminal region of one light chain with CDR2 of the heavy chain from a neighbouring Fv; and (3) the reciprocal arrangement of the CDR2 of the light
chain with the N-terminal part of the heavy chain

of the neighbouring Fv. The antiparallel stacking can be seen at the junction of the magenta and brown Fvs (and of the yellow and green units) in the lower panel of Figure 7. Four hydrogen bonds between main-chain atoms stabilize this type of packing. The peptide amide group of Ser L9 and the carbonyl oxygen of Ser LlO (magenta mobecule) are situated near the Ocarbonyl oxygen (32 A) and amide nitrogen (3.2 A) of Ser L12 in the symmetry-related molecule (brown unit). Reciprocally, Ser L9 and Ser LlO of the brown unit interact with Ser L12 in the magenta molecule. There are also van der Waals contacts between opposing pairs of residues. The /I-carbon and hydroxyl oxygen atoms of Ser L7 (magenta) impinge on the backbone of the brown unit at Arg L18; Pro L8 @-carbon) is in contact with the backbone of Ser L12 (brown) and side-chain of Ala L13; the B-carbon of Ser L9 also approaches the backbone at Ser L12 (brown); and the side-chain of Leu Lll is in contact with the backbone at Ser I,10 (brown). These interactions are duplicat,ed by the

Figure 7. Stereo diagrams of the packing of the Pot Fv in the crystal lattice. Top: two contiguous unit cells, each containing eight asymmetric units (individual Fv molecules). The calculated solvent content (Matthews, 1968) of this crystal form is only 365%. Bottom: a view rotated more than 90" around the z axis relative to the orientation in the upper panel. This panel illustrates that the Fv molecules interact in pairs. The anti-parallel alignment of two strands of the light chain components (N-terminal strand of the 4-chain layer in Fig. 5) can clearly be seen at the interface of the pair colour-coded magenta and brown (or at the junction of the yellow and green units). This arrangement is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms of opposing light chains: the amide hydrogen at Ser LQ in the magenta unit interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Ser L12 in the brown Fv and the carbonyl oxygen of Ser LlO makes a hydrogen bond with the peptide amide group of Ser L12 (brown molecule). Reciprocally, the corresponding backbone atoms of LQ and LlO of the symmetry related molecule (brown) form hydrogen bonds with L12 of the magenta unit. Numerous other packing interactions are discussed in the text. Note, the brown unit is in the top right corner.

contacts of the backbone atoms of the magenta molecule with side chains of the brown unit. N-Terminal aspartic acid of the light chain closely interacts with the Ser-Gly-Gly segment (residues 53-55) in CDR2 of a symmetry-related heavy chain. The N-terminus can be identified as the tip of the single chain (brown unit) pointing at the magenta Fv in the upper right of the top panel of Figure 7. The t-amino group of aspartic acid hydrogen bonds (3.1 A) with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ser H53 and one of its carboFy1 oxygens interacts with the hydroxyl group (30 A) of the side-chain. These anchoring interactions are supplemented by seven van der Waals contacts with the two glycine residues. Gin L3 makes contact with Ala H118, Thr Hl20 and Leu H121 of the heavy chain tail in a symmetry related molecule (interactions not seen in Fig. 7). Ser L26 and Gln L27 of CDRl (adjacent to the N-terminal segment) also contribute to holding the heavy chain tail in one conformation. Together, they form 16 contacts with atoms of Ser H117, Ala H 118 and Pro H119, including hydrogen bonds hydroxyl aad the between the Ser L26 side-chain main chain carbonyl oxygen of Ser H117 (2.9 A) and between the amide group of Gln L27 and the amide group of Ser Hl17 (2.7 A). While the overall similarities in the light and the heavy chain heavy chains are very strong, constituent's do not participate in as many close packing interactions. For example, the N-terminal segment and the adjacent CDRl loop are in posit,ions roughly analogous to those related by pseudo-twofold symmetry in the light chain, but only five atoms are in van der Waals contacts with other molecules. The side chains of the N-terminal glutamic acid residues in two adjacent molecules face each other, but make only one contact. His H3 closely approaches Glu L45 but again just touches one atom. Backbone atoms of Gly H26 and Phe H27 (CDRl) are in contact with the main-chain of a symmet,ry molecule at Gly 157 (just after (`DR2) but do not form any hydrogen bonds. the light In summary. chain component dominates the packing interactions of the Pot' Fv. third This is the successive example of immunoglobulins studied in our group where the crystal packing was determined primarily by a in the k--type light chain. Despite 42 substitutions sequences of the heavy chain V domains, the murine 4-4-20 Fab (complexed with fluorescein) and the unliganded BV-0401 Fab formed isomorphous crystals in 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and ammonium sulphate, respectively (Gibson et aZ., 1988; Herron et al., 1989, 1991). The structural features critical for packing were found in both light chains, which differed in only six positions. In both the space group was triclinic (one instances. molecule in the unit cell) and the packing interactions were less intricate than those in the crystals of Pot Fv. What sets the Pot Fv apart is the short segment of b-pleated sheet encompassing residues L9 to L13 (see lower left of Fig. 6). This segment bridges the

four- and five-stranded layers to help stabilize the and simultaneously links two Fv V, domain molecules together in the crystal lattice. The 4-4-20 and BV04-01 light chains belong to a different subclass than Pot (II versus I) and do not have the appropriate sequences for such interactions. (i) Model of the active site in the truncated prote,in

In a relatively open structure with a combining site shaped like a cavity (e.g. the Meg light chain dimer; Edmundson et al., 1974, 1991: El\: rt aZ.. 1989), as many as 21 side chains may be available for ligand binding around the rim and within the cavity itself. These residues are derived from the three CDRs and the adjacent framework segments. In the restricted high affinity binding slot for rt al., fluorescein in the 4-4-20 antibody (Herron 1989), there are only six side chains in contact with the ligand (five from the light chain and one from the heavy chain, all from CDRs). Both proteins have deep binding pockets adjacent to. but physically distinct from, the main active sit'e. These deep sites provide an additional pool of contact, residues for the binding of aromatic compounds or peptides in the Meg dimer or molecules of solvent in the 4-4-20 Fab. Between these two ext,remes is the BV04-01, which has a groove for the binding of single-stranded DNA (Herron et al., 1991). Constituents of five of the six CDRs (CUR2 of the light chain is the exception) contribute t)o the binding of this `linear' polymer. In the crystal structure of the Pot Fv there is no evidence for a discrete cavity, slot, pocket or a groove. Block-end types of binding like those of the complexes of antibody fragments with proteins (Amit et al., 1986: Colman et al., 1987; Colman, 1988; Sheriff et al.. 1987; Padlan et al., 1989; Bentley et al.. 1990: Bhat et al., 1990) seem to be the most attractive alternatives, but at the time of writing we have not identified any test ligands. The development of the binding site into its present form is an interesting problem that, lends itself to model building with interactive computer First the amino acid sequence of a graphics. molecule with a shortened heavy chain was used for crystallographic refinement. The structure of the light chain was indistinguishable from that of the present model within the expected errors of the procedure. Except for CDR3 and FR4 the heavy chain components were also closely similar. These results suggest, that the tertiary structures of the light chain and the remaining segments of the heavy chain were not markedly affected by substantial changes in CDR3 and FR4 of the heavy chain. We therefore directed our attention solely to CDR3 and FR4. In the ascending arms of the CDR3 loops in the two proteins, the sequences of residues H91-H94 were identical in t'he two models and the conformations were also superimposable. Alignments of the sequences suggest that the descending arms of the loops came back int,o register at the position corresponding to Gly H106 in Figure 3

Figure 8. Stereo diagrams of the regions associated with the antigen combining site. These skeletal models were constructed and displayed with the program TURBO-FRODO (Cambillau, 1991). Light chain constituents are coloured yellow and heavy chain components are in lavender. Top: the light-heavy chain interface of a hypothetical structure based on a shortened amino acid sequence of the Pot heavy chain in the CDR3 and FR4 regions. Note that the space between the light and heavy chains is adequate to accommodate small ligands or linear polymers. Bottom: active site region as it is seen in the crystal structure of the Pot protein, i.e. with a longer CDR3 and an FR4 of normal size. The extra residues, represented by van der Waals surfaces in blue, consume most of the residual space between the light and heavy chains and make external binding a necessity

(i.e. in the conserved P-pleated sheet section of FR4). With its two ends anchored, CDR3 in the shortened chain had to make a reverse turn after Lys H94. If the conformations of the five remaining hypervariable loops are assumed to be identical in the two models, the putative binding site in the truncated form would be an irregular groove 6 A-15 A wide, 17 A long and 13 A deep. The general topography of this site is illustrated in Figure 8 (top panel). Prominent residues identified as constituents of active sites in other immunoglobulins would be accessible for ligand binding. Side chains of Tyr H91, Ala H93, His H95, Arg H96 and Tyr H99 would be contributed by FR3 and CDRS. Lys H94 and Arg H96 would be located at the top of CDR3 in positions accessible to solvent but oriented away from the active site. The rest of the site would have side chains in familiar positions. As in the Meg light chain dimer (Ely et al., 1989), homologous residues

from CDRl and FR2 would line the site in the order of Tyr L32, Ala L34, Tyr L36 and Gln L38 from the open end at the top (see Fig. 5) to the terminus of the deep binding pocket. These residues are matched by the heavy chain constituents Phe H32, Val H33, Ser H35, Val H37 and Gln H39. Again in analogy with Meg, Arg L47, Tyr L49, Asp L50 and Glu L55 from FR2 and CDR2 are in positions appropriate for ligand binding. Similarly, Trp H47, Phe H52 and Asp H58 are arrayed opposite Leu L94, Leu L96 and Pro L95 of CDR3. The latter also supplies Gln L91, Tyr L93, Thr L97 and Phe L98 to a potential binding site. Thus the constituents of a relatively conventional immunoglobulin combining site are in place in the model of the truncated protein and the shortened CDR3 and FR4 do not interfere with access to the key residues. Even the space analogous to the deep binding pocket in the Meg light chain dimer is accessible in the truncated model. In Meg four aromatic side

Structure of an IgM Fv chains are in loose van der Waals contact at the entry of the deep pocket, but these residues can be partially displaced by some ligands (Edmundson et al., 1974, 1991). Three of the corresponding residues in Pot Fv are also aromatic (Tyr L36, Phe L98 and Trp H103), but the fourth is Val H37, which is too small to seal the entrance. Though not found in large numbers, ordered solvent molecules have been detected in this pocket in the crystal structure of Pot Fv. (j) Active site in the crystal structure A stereo diagram of the active site region in the present crystal structure is shown in the lower panel of Figure 8. Residues adding to the size of the CDR3 and FR4 displayed in the upper panel are presented as van der Waals surface representations. With its ends anchored in the stable regions of P-pleated sheet, the expanded CDR3 might have been expected to balloon out to leave as much space as possible between the two domains. Instead, it appears to have collapsed into this space and effectively blocked the entrance to a more convent,ional active site such as that shown in the upper panel of Figure 8. In particular, the new heavy chain CDR3 covers the surface of the light chain CDR3 that would normally be available for ligand binding. It also shields other regions like the segment containing Val H33 and Ser H35 of CDRl It is interesting that CDR3 of the Kol heavy chain also obstructs entry of ligands into a potential active site (Marquart et al., 1980). Unlike the Pot CDR3, however, the Kol loop protrudes outside the normal boundaries of the active site and forms an external convex surface stabilized by a disulphide bond between residues 1OOa and 1OOf. Thus there are two examples in which one heavy chain segment with space encroaching properties can partially negate the diversity possible with five other hypervariable loops. Moreover, the introduction of such a segment can impose new or even dominant specificity on a molecule. In the Pot protein, CDR3 should abrogate potential ligand binding on internal surfaces. This supposition was tested by attempts to demonstrate binding of the Pot pentameric IgM protein to peptides by the method of Geysen et al. (1987). All possible dipeptides of the 20 common L-amino acids, as well as blocks of miscellaneous tri- and tetrapeptides, were screened by this procedure Edmundson & Geysen, unpublished (Tribbick, results). Only a few peptides containing arginine gave positive results and the low absorbance values in the assays (ELISA) were not very convincing. Most. immunoglobulins ( > 90%) examined in Geysen's laboratory show some degree of binding activity if exposed to the variety of potential ligands presented to the Pot IgM. As a control in the present study, another human IgM protein (Mez) reacted with the same sets of peptides and produced satisfactory results at dilutions 1000 times greater than those used for the Pot protein. We concluded

203

that small peptides probably do not penetrate into the interface of the Pot V domains and certainly are not bound in significant amounts. (k) Placement of solvent molecules Locations of the ordered water molecules around the skeletal models of the Pot polypeptide chains are shown Figure 9. The distribution of these water molecules is summarized in Table 6. Of the total of 147, 81 are near the heavy chain and 66 are close to the light chain. At least 96 are hydrogen bonded to protein constituents and 23 are linked with other water molecules. Although the majority (66) of water molecules interacted with one protein (or water) substituent, it is not unusual for a single water molecule to be within hydrogen bonding distance of two (36 examples) or even three (17 cases) different atoms. Backbone chain atoms are associated with 58 water molecules. There is a decided preference for the carbonyl oxygens over the peptide amide groups (49 to 9). Collectively, the oxygen and nitrogen atoms on ten types of side chains are in hydrogen bonding distance of 38 solvent molecules. Hydroxyl and tyrosine are groups of serine, threonine favoured to about the same extent as the carboxyl oxygens and amide nitrogens of aspartic and glutamic acids and their amides. Even the long side chains of the basic amino acids, histidine, lysine and arginine, have ordered water molecules at their distal ends in some cases. This distribution of ordered solvent fits the patterns expected in typical crystal analyses of proteins (Blake et al., 1983; Ely et al., 1989; Teeter, 1989). No extensive networks of waters have been detected but there are examples of two or three molecules in a series emanating from protein atoms. Hydrogen bonding loops are observed when water

Skeletal models consisting of backbone atoms were constructed with the program INSTGIIT. The light chain is yellow, the heavy chain is lavender and the water molecules are blue.

act as bridges between hydrated protein atoms. For instance, water molecules bound to the carbonyl oxygen of Asn L31 and the hydroxyl group of Tyr L32 are themselves linked to complete the circuit. In other regions (e.g. Pro L44 and Glu L45), a third water molecule bridges the two that are bound to the protein atoms. molecules

The presence of the domain tails affords the opportunity to examine solvent patterns around relatively unfettered segments. From Lys 1,107 to the end of the light chain. five of eight backbone oxygens, two backbone nitrogens and four side chains are hydrated. From Ser H112 to Leu H121, six of ten carbonyl oxygens, five amide nitrogens

and four side chains are linked to ordered solvent are generally molecules. These observations applicable to other exposed residues like those from CDRs 1 and 2. In CDRl backbone atoms of Gln L27, Asp L28 and Ser L30, as well as the side chains of L28 and L30-32, are hydrated. An ordered water is also present next to the carbonyl oxygen of Ile H31, a hydrophobic residue found on the surface of Fv. In CDR2 residues 52, 53, 55 and 56 in the light chain and 54, 55, 57, 65 and 68 in the heavy chain are associated with at least one solvent molecule. The CDR3s are worthy of special mention. In the heavy chain the only CDR3 constituent with an attached water is Tyr H99, which is on the surface (see Fig. 4). At Trp H103, the first residue of FR4, the hydration of the segment recommences and continues to the end of the tail. The pattern is markedly different in the light chain. Prominent members of the interface of the V, and V, domains, including Gln L92, Leu L94 and Leu L96 of CDRS, as well as Phe L98 and Gly L99 of FR4, all have hydrated carbonyl oxygens in the polypeptide backbone. Figure 9 (top panel) shows that water molecules are clustered near Tyr H99, around what would be the normal entrance to a concave binding site. However, the paucity of solvent on V, constituents along the rest of the interface with V, needs to be understood. A comparison of the model of the shortened version with the actual crystal structure provides a plausible explanation for these observations. Views down the V,-V, interface are presented for the two models in the middle and lower panels of Figure 9. Solvent patterns defined for the crystal structure are superimposed on each model. Note how much space is available to receive additional molecules of water when the CDR3 and FR4 are truncated in V, (middle panel). Expansion of the CDR3 leads to severe depletion of this space (bottom panel), particularly when side chains are included in the model. While most ligands would be excluded from binding along the interface, there is adequate space for entry of small molecules like water to the CDR3 surface of the light chain. At the FR4 levels of the interface the spatial restrictions on V, components are more relaxed, and both chains begin to be hydrated to approximately the same extent.
(1) Concluding remarks

from the heavy chain are Ile H31, and Met H34 from CDRl, most of the external loop of CDR2 (e.g. Ser H53, Asn H56, Thr H57 and Asp H58), and His H95, Arg H96 and Tyr H99 from CDRS. As a reviewer emphasized, the Pot IgM was secreted from a malignant cell line, which probably escaped selective pressure for antigen binding during B-cell maturation. Moreover, the levels of discrimination in the recognition of antigens are generally lower in IgM molecules than in IgG proteins appearing later in the immune response. In peptide recognition the Pot protein is an outlier relative to other IgM and IgG immunoglobulins we have tested with Geysen's techniques. We concluded that this diminished reactivity is attributable to the presence of one anomalous loop. It is curious that this loop is coded by germline D and J genes, while the more canonical CDRs are products of mutated genes. Access to a large solvent channel between the V, and V, domains can be demonstrated on the graphics screen by truncation of CDRS, but more definitive information will be obtained by comparison of the Pot structure with those of IgMs that actually bind peptides. Such studies are presently under way.

In the crystal structure, the Pot Fv does not have an internal active site shaped like a cavity, pocket or groove. As in the human Kol IgGl immunoglobulin (Marquart et al., 1980), the third hypervariable loop of the heavy chain prevents access to any potential concave site. An external active site is a logical alternative but the potential contact residues have to be drawn from a significantly smaller pool than in a typical antibody. Possible light chain components include Asn L31 and Tyr L32 from CDRl, Asp L50, Asn L53 and Glu L55 from CDR2 and Gln L89, Tyr L91, Gln L92 and Asn L93 from CDRS. Potential contact residues
