ABSTRACT: Three R-mercaptoacyldipeptides differing essentially in the size of their C-terminal residues have been crystallized in the thermolysin active site. A new mode of binding was observed for 3 [HSCH(CH2Ph)CO-Phe-Tyr] and 4 [HS-CH((CH2)4CH3)CO-Phe-Ala], in which the mercaptoacyl moieties act as bidentates with Zn-S and Zn-O distances of 2.3 and 2.4 Å, respectively, the side chains fitting the S1, S1, and S2 pockets. Moreover, a distance of 3.1 Å between the sulfur atom and the OE1 of Glu143 suggests that they are H-bonded and that one of these atoms is protonated. This H-bond network involving Glu143, the mercaptoacyl group of the inhibitor, and the Zn ion could be considered a "modified" transition state mimic of the peptide bond hydrolysis. Due to the presence of the hindering (5-phenyl)proline, the inhibitor HS-CH(CH2Ph)CO-Gly-(5-Ph)Pro (2) interacts through the usual Zn monodentation via the thiol group and occupancy of S1 and S2 subsites by the aromatic moieties, the proline ring being outside the active site. The inhibitory potencies are consistent with these structural data, with higher affinities for 3 (4.2 × 10-8 M) and 4 (4.8 × 10-8 M) than for 2 (1.2 × 10-6 M). The extension of the results, obtained with thermolysin being considered as the model of physiological zinc metallopeptidases, allows inhibitorrecognition modes for other peptidases, such as angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, to be proposed and opens interesting possibilities for the design of new classes of inhibitors.

Thermolysin (TLN,1 EC 3.4.24.4) is a proteolytic enzyme with a molecular weight of 34 600 isolated from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus. This enzyme contains one zinc ion that is essential for hydrolytic activity and four calcium ions that are required for its thermostability. Crystallographic studies with thermolysin complexed with a variety of inhibitors have provided evidence for the mode of interaction of extended substrates with the S2-S2 2 subsites of the enzyme (1) and have suggested a mechanism of action for peptide hydrolysis (2, 3).

Physiological enzymes such as neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin, NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) (reviewed in ref 4), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) (reviewed in ref 5), and endothelin converting enzyme (reviewed in ref 6) belong to the same family of metallopeptidases as TLN. All these enzymes possess the two consensus sequences HexxH and ExxxD (7), located in helical structures, which constitute the catalytic domain of TLN (2). These analogies have been supported by results of mutagenesis experiments carried out either with NEP alone or in parallel with both NEP and TLN (8, 9), allowing a three-dimensional model of the active site of NEP derived from that of TLN to be proposed (10). Therefore, crystallographic data for various thermolysin-inhibitor complexes are useful both in understanding the mechanism of action of these enzymes and in designing potent inhibitors (11, 12). Thus, TLN is now classically used as a three-dimensional model to identify the interactions stabilizing an inhibitor in the active site of NEP (10) or to design new NEP inhibitors (4, 13, 41). On the basis of these results, we have proposed that R-mercaptoacyldipeptides such as (2-sulfanyl-3-phenylpropanoyl)Ala-Pro (14), compound 1, or [(2S)-2-sulfanyl3-phenylpropanoyl]Gly-(5-Ph)Pro, compound 2 (15), bind to NEP and TLN by a thiol-induced coordination of Zn2+ ion and by interacting with the S1 and S2 subsites of these enzymes (Table 1). This mode of enzyme recognition,

Table 1: Mode of Recognition of TLN by Various Mercaptoacyl Derivatives and Comparison of Their Ki Values on TLN, NEP, and ACE Activitiesa

a The modes of binding of compounds 2-4 (this paper), 7 (16), and 8 (12) to TLN have been experimentally determined, and those of compounds 1, 5, 6, and 9 are inferred from their similarity to the related inhibitors cocrystallized with TLN (1 with 2, 5 and 6 with 4, and 9 with 2). b Ki values are the mean ( the standard error of the mean from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. c The asterisk indicates racemic asymmetric carbons. d From ref 16.

leaving the S1 subsite empty, was also proposed to account for the binding of the tricyclic R-mercaptoacyl derivative CGS-28106 7 in TLN (16).

However, the spatial proximity of the thiol groups and the oxygen of the adjacent amide bond suggests that a zinc bidendation, previously demonstrated in the case of TLN for

Bidentation of Mercaptoacyldipeptide in Zn Metallopeptidases inhibitors with hydroxamate (17) or carboxyl-zinc coordinating groups (11), could occur in the case of R-mercaptoacyldipeptides. To investigate this possibility, three R-mercaptoacyldipeptides have been cocrystallized with TLN: [(2S)-2-sulfanyl3-phenylpropanoyl]Gly-(5-Ph)Pro 2, [(2S)-2-sulfanyl-3phenylpropanoyl]Phe-Tyr 3, and [(2S,R)-2-sulfanylheptanoyl]Phe-Ala 4. A new mode of bidendate recognition of a metallopeptidase with a pentacoordination of the zinc ion and the occupancy of the S1, S1, and S2 subsites was observed for compounds 3 and 4. Conversely, as previously proposed (15), compound 2 acts as a monodentate for the zinc ion and occupies only the S1 and S2 subsites of TLN. This indicates that in this enzyme, the two types of binding modes are possible but are not equivalent in terms of stabilizing energies. The comparison of the inhibitory potencies of the three compounds and various analogues of TLN, NEP, and ACE allows their proposed mode of binding to the two latter enzymes to be confirmed, and extends the way for designing new types of inhibitors. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Chemicals [(2S)-2-Sulfanyl-3-phenylpropanoyl]Gly-(5-Ph)Pro (RB106) 2, [(2S)-2-sulfanyl-3-phenylpropanoyl]Phe-Tyr 3, and [(2S,R)2-sulfanyl-heptanoyl]Phe-Ala 4 were synthesized in the laboratory as described previously (14, 15). Biochemical Assays Neutral endopeptidase from rabbit kidney (18) and angiotensin converting enzyme from rat testis (19) were purified to homogeneity as previously described. Thermolysin was from Sigma (France). Inhibitory potencies were determined by using [3H]Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu as the substrate for TLN (Km ) 200 µM) (20), N-Cbz-Phe-His-Leu (Km ) 50 mM) as the substrate for ACE (21), and [3H]Tyr-D-Ala2-Gly-PheLeu (Km ) 30 µM) as the substrate for NEP (22). Accounting for their competitive nature, the Ki values of the inhibitors were determined by using the Cheng-Prusoff relationship [Ki ) IC50/(1 + [S]/Km)]. Crystallography Crystallization. TLN was cocrystallized with the three different inhibitors using the hanging drop method, following the procedure described by Matthews et al. (23). For removal of added salts, 13 mg of lyophilized TLN was suspended in 0.7 mL of water and centrifuged at 7400g. The dottle was redissolved in 100 µL of solution A [50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane/acetate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.5 M Ca(CH3COO)2, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM NaN3, and 45% (v/v) DMSO]. Enzyme concentrations were estimated using an 280 of 56 000 M-1 cm-1. (1) TLN Compound 2. One microliter drops (110 mg/mL, 3.2 mM TLN, 17 mM 2 in solution A) were equilibrated against 1 mL of reservoir which contains 530 µL of solution A and 470 µL of water. Hexagonal crystals grew in 1 month at 5 °C.

Hexagonal crystals were obtained after about 2 weeks at 5 °C. Data Collection. Diffraction data were recorded using the LURE synchrotron facility, in Orsay (France). TLN-2, TLN-3, and TLN-4 crystal diffraction data were collected at wavelengths of 0.97 Å (2 and 4) and 1.01 Å (3) using 300 and 180 mm diameter MAR Research Image Plate systems, respectively, connected to the W32 and DW21b beam lines (24, 25). One single crystal of each TLNinhibitor complex was used and roughly oriented with the crystallographic c axis at an angle of 20° to the rotation axis. With this orientation and for the hexagonal space group, a 40° total rotation is enough to collect a complete data set at 2.1, 2.2, and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. Data were processed with the MOSFLM package (26), and then merged and scaled with SCALA and AGROVATA from the CCP4 suite (27). Table 2 summarizes the results of the processing. Structure Refinement. The three structure refinements were carried out by following the same procedure. They started from the native TLN structure already refined at 1.6 Å resolution [PDB file name 1LNF (28)] (29). The thermal parameters were set to an overall B value deduced from Wilson plots (B ) 15.5 Å2 for 2, B ) 16.6 Å2 for 3, and B ) 14.5 Å2 for 4). At the beginning of the refinements, the complexed dipeptide Val-Lys and all solvent molecules were removed from the model (29). Because the crystals of inhibitor-TLN complexes were isomorphous with respect to native TLN 1LNF, the refinements began with a rigidbody least-squares refinement [X-plor (30)], followed by refinement of the atomic positions by energy minimization at the initial resolution of 2.5 Å. This resolution was progressively increased to the maximum of 2.1 Å for 2, 2.2 Å for 3, and 2.0 Å for 4. At this stage, grouped thermal parameters (two for each residue) were refined and around 50 water molecules located outside the active site were added in each structure. Using amplitudes where F > 2(F), the residuals were as follows: for 2 (d ) 10-2.1 Å), Rfree ) 27.8% (31) and Rfac ) 23.2%; for 3 (d ) 10-2.2 Å), Rfree ) 26.2% and Rfac ) 21.4%; and for 4 (d ) 10-2.0 Å), Rfree )

FIGURE 1: Stereodrawing showing a part of the active site region of TLN. The model (ball-and-stick), representing the fully refined structure, has been superimposed on difference electron density (contoured at 2) with coefficients (Fo - Fc, omit) based on the differences between observed amplitudes from the complex data set and calculated amplitudes from the refined model with the inhibitor and nearby solvent molecules removed. The map shows the S configuration of 4 at the level of C317, the atom bearing the thiol group. Thus, from the racemate of 4, only one inhibitor has been selected by thermolysin during the diffusion process: magenta, Zn atom; gray, inhibitor; and yellow, enzyme side chains.

28.8% and Rfac ) 24.2%. In each structure, a Fourier difference map revealed a residual electron density located in the active site and corresponding to the complexed molecule. The thiol group was placed in the highest peak of the map near the Zn metal. The backbone and the substituents of the inhibitors were then constructed together in the wellshaped electron density. Files describing the inhibitors were created using X-plor parameters. Energy terms were empirically adjusted to those of X-plor. In the peculiar case of 4, the absolute configuration of the thiol-substituted carbon remained unknown at this stage, and its pentyl substituent was not modeled. The following refinements consisted of a progressive introduction of solvent molecules with good geometry, and refinement of the individual thermal parameters and atomic positions. The quality of the refined models was regularly checked using Procheck (32), What-Check (33), and the RS-fit procedure of the O package (34). In the structure of 3, after energy minimization, introduction of 50 water molecules and B-grouped refinements (Rfree ) 25.2%, Rfac ) 21.0%), the configuration of the asymmetric carbon was unambiguously recognized as being only S form (Figure 1), and the aliphatic substituent was modeled. In the three structures, the last Fourier difference maps exhibited two (3 and 4) or three (2) important residual densities which cannot be interpreted as water molecules because of the absence of putative H-bonding in a hydrophobic environment and because of a broad density shape. Although individual atomic positions cannot be distinguished, we best modeled these densities using DMSO molecules. One of them was previously observed in several structures of TLN [PDB file names 1HYT (35), 1LND (29), 1LNF (29), and 8TLN (36)]. In the very last step of refinement, the structures were refined against the whole set of crystallographic data, consequently without any Rfree calculation. The statistics of the refined structures are summarized in Table 3. RESULTS The mercaptoacyldipeptides 2-4 have the general formula HS-CH(R1)-CO-AA1-AA2. They mimic tripeptides H2N-CH(R1)-CO-AA1-AA2, with the N-terminal amino group re-

placed with a thiol. Consequently, the various atoms of these three residues are numbered 317 for the sulfanyl moiety HSCH(R1)-CO and 318 and 319 for amino acids AA1 and AA2, respectively. The refined models of complexes exhibited two different binding modes for the inhibitors of TLN (Figure 2). The interaction of 2 with TLN was identical to that previously proposed from molecular modeling (15), whereas a new binding mode was observed for TLN-3 and TLN-4, which, to the best of our knowledge, was not described yet for zinc metallopeptidases. Metal Binding. The inhibitors 3 and 4 interact through bidentation with the zinc atom, the sulfur and the oxygen of the mercaptoacyl function being coordinated to the metal with distances of 2.3 and 2.4 Å, respectively. The five zinc ligands form a distorted trigonal bipyramid. NE2 (His146) and the carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor occupy axial positions, while the sulfur ligand S (317) and the coordinating enzyme amino acids, NE2 (His142) and OE2 (Glu166), are in a planar position. In such a conformation, the O (317), liganded to zinc, is also close to NE2 (His231) and the sulfur atom is 3.1 Å from the OE1 of Glu143 (Figure 2b,c).

The Zn coordination in the TLN-2 complex is approximately tetrahedral with three ligands provided by TLN [NE2 (His146), NE2 (His142), and OE2 (Glu166)] and the fourth provided by the sulfur atom of the mercapto inhibitor (Figure 2a).

H-Bonding of the Inhibitor Backbones in the ActiVe Site. In the crystal structures of TLN-3 and TLN-4, the backbone conformations are similar to those modeled for the natural substrate in the transition state (3) (Figure 2b,c). Thus, the zinc atom is pentacoordinated with a binding mode

Gaucher et al. S1 subsite. Its very low thermal parameters (6.7 Å2 for 3 and 8.5 Å2 for 4) are reminiscent of tight binding. The R1 substituent of 3 is a benzyl group whose aromatic ring is oriented toward the side chains of Asn112, Phe114, and Tyr157. Nevertheless, no stacking effect was observed. The same contacts are observed with these residues in the TLN-4 structure, where the R1 substituent of the inhibitor is a pentyl chain. In agreement with the increased degrees of freedom of R1, the corresponding thermal parameters (for R1-3, B ) 11.0 Å2, and for R1-4, B ) 21.9 Å2) are higher than those observed for the P1 component. In both structures, R1 is also found in hydrophobic contact with one DMSO molecule located at the end of the S1 binding site, but this interaction did not significantly mask R1 from the solvent. Further interactions of both inhibitors with TLN differ at the level of the S2 subsite. In 4, the side chain of AA2 (Ala) points toward the S2 subsite with van der Waals contact with Leu202. In the TLN-3 structure, the corresponding side chain is a tyrosine, whose phenyl group completely fills the S2 subsite cavity. However, interactions are not very well optimized in this region as shown by the relatively high B-factor of the Tyr side chain (B ) 28.1 Å2) compared to those of other substituents located in S1 or S1 subsites. No hydrogen bond was observed for the phenol group. Compound 2 (RB106) exhibits a different mode of binding, which is similar to that proposed for the CGS-28106 inhibitor (16) (Figure 3b). The benzyl of R1 occupies the S1 subsite. Compared to the position of the phenyl ring of 3 and 4 in the same subsite, a shift of 1.3 Å is observed. Moreover, the thermal parameters are relatively high (B ) 21.2 Å2). The phenyl ring of the phenyl proline AA2 fits the S2 subsite of the enzyme as this occurs with Tyr in the TLN-3 complex (Figure 3b), and the proline is outside the active site. Inhibitory Potencies of Various Mercaptoacyl DeriVatiVes toward TLN, NEP, and ACE. The inhibitory potencies of various R- and -mercaptoacyldipeptides were reported in Table 1 for the three enzymes. For TLN, these compounds could be classified in two categories. The first series contains compounds 1, 2, and 6-9, which have Ki values in the 10-6 M range. The second series contains compounds 3-5, which have inhibitory potencies in the 10-8 M range. The large difference in the Ki values between the two series of compounds could be related to a different mode of binding to TLN. For NEP inhibition, all the compounds have Ki values in the nanomolar range which could reflect an identical mode of recognition of the active site of this peptidase. A slight decrease in potency was observed for 6 and 7 which have Ki values in the 10-8 M range. For ACE inhibition, R-mercaptoacyldipeptides 1-5 have Ki values in the nanomolar (3 and 5) or sub-nanomolar (1 and 2) range, indicating a full occupancy of the active site, as compared to compounds 6, 8, and 9 which have Ki values between 10-6 and 10-8 M. DISCUSSION Several sulfhydryl-containing inhibitors have been cocrystallized with TLN for the purpose of investigating their binding mode and ultimately developing hypotheses for their interactions with the active sites of related zinc metallopeptidases such as ACE and NEP. The compounds used

FIGURE 3: Inhibitors 3 (a) and 2 (b) are represented on the molecular surface of the active site of thermolysin. The orientation is the same as in Figure 2. The code of colors for the TLN surface is as follows: gray, hydrophobic residues; violet, Zn atom; and green, hydrophilic residues and backbone.

which implies that O (317) and S (317) take the place of the oxygen atom of the cleavable peptide bond of the substrate and that of the catalytic water molecule, respectively. Moreover, they exhibit equivalent H-bonding in the active site; the NH of the P1 component (Phe318) is connected to the CO of Ala113, and the CO of Phe318 is doubly bonded to the guanidinium group of Arg203. The CONH2 group of Asn112 functions as both a hydrogen bond acceptor and donor group toward the HN and C-terminal carboxyl groups of the P2 amino acid (Tyr319 in 3 and Ala in 4), respectively. The terminal carboxyl group was also found to be bound with three water molecules. This hydration network is observed in the two structures. In the case of the TLN-2 complex (Figure 2a), the backbone of the inhibitor is shifted by one amino acid toward the S subsites compared to those of the TLN-3 and TLN-4 complexes, leaving the S1 subsite empty. The O (317) atom forms a double hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of Arg203, and the N and O atoms of Phe318 are connected to OD1 and ND2 of Asn112, respectively. The proline residue did not interact with TLN and is located outside the active site with hydrogen bonds formed between its carboxyl group and water molecules. Subsite Binding. For inhibitors 3 and 4, the substituent R1 and the side chains of AA1 and AA2 bind subsites S1, S1, and S2, respectively. As shown in Figure 3a, the S1 and S2 subsites form pockets with partially lipophilic surfaces, whereas S1 is a deep hydrophobic cavity. In both structures, AA1 is a Phe residue (P1 component) which fits well in the

Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 39, 1999 12575 2.7 Å from NE2 of His231, suggesting the occurrence of a strong electrostatic interaction with the protonated imidazole group. This is in accordance with results of mutagenesis experiments performed on the TLN-like protease produced by Bacillus stearothermophillus. Thus, the replacement of His231, with Phe or Ala, was shown to drastically reduce the affinity of the mutated enzyme for hydroxamate, carboxylate, or phosphonic inhibitors (38). Conversely, the weak effect on the Ki values of 4 toward H231F and H231A mutants suggests that, in this case, the loss of the electrostatic interaction between NE2 of His231+ and the negatively charged oxygen of the mercaptoacyl carbonyl group is probably offset by an enhancement of the interaction between this oxygen and the Zn ion in both mutants. Finally, the NH of the mercaptoamide function is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl of Ala113. All these interactions have been previously found in the complexes of TLN and bidentate inhibitors bearing a carboxylate (CLT), phosphonate (ZGPLL or ZFPLA), and hydroxamate as zinc-coordinating moieties (2). They have been proposed to mimic the interactions occurring between the substrate and the enzyme during the hydrolysis of the peptide bond. It can be observed that the mercaptoacyl moiety creates the same stabilizing network of H bonds as that occurring in the transition state. Contributions of the Different Inhibitor Side Chains to TLN Subsite Binding. Compounds 3 and 4 have very similar conformations (rmsd ) 0.26 Å) and identical modes of binding to TLN. Their Ki values for TLN are 42 nM for (S)-3 and 48 nM for (R,S)-4. However, as our work shows unambiguously that only the S enantiomer of 4 was found cocrystallized with TLN, we could assume that the Ki value of the optically pure (S)-4 is lower. The importance of the S1 recognition is clearly demonstrated by the 50-fold lower inhibitory potency of 6, a compound differing from 4 and 5 only by the removal of the aliphatic or aromatic side chain shown in 4 to fit the S1 subsite. It can be assumed that 6 interacts like 4 and 5 by a zinc bidentation. Indeed, a single interaction with Zn by the SH group would have shifted the inhibitor inside the TLN active site, resulting in an empty S1 subsite (Table 1). Therefore, the lower Ki of 6 is mainly due to the loss of hydrophobic interactions occurring between the R1 side chain and the S1 subsite, and probably also to the higher flexibility of the mercaptoacetyl group. In compound 3, the p-hydroxylphenyl group located in the S2 subsite of TLN did not improve the TLN recognition as shown by the fact that the Ki value was lower for 3 than for 5. This is in agreement with the experimental observation that the phenol group has relatively high thermal parameters, due to the large degree of accessibility of the S2 subsite at the surface of the enzyme, in the TLN-3 structure. This has been previously observed in the TLN-CLT structure (11) in which the tryptophan residue of the inhibitor, located in the P2 position, also has high thermal parameters. The difference in the binding mode of compounds 1, 2, and 7-9 versus that of 3-5 in TLN accounts for their Ki values; the bidentation of Zn2+ ion and the occupancy of the S1 subsite induce a 2 order of magnitude increase in affinity compared to those of inhibitors which interact only with the S1 and S2 subsites and act as Zn monodentates. The different modes of binding of the R-mercaptoacyl inhibitors to TLN are easily explained by the size of the S2 subsite which cannot accommodate bulky groups such as

previously belonged to -thiol inhibitors such as (2-benzyl3-mercaptopropionyl)-L-alanine glycine amide (BAG) (37), thiorphan1 and retrothiorphan (12), or an R-thiol inhibitor such as CGS-28106 (16) (Table 1). All these compounds are rather poor inhibitors of TLN, with Ki values in the 10-6 M range, and behave as monodentate inhibitors with a roughly tetrahedral coordination of the zinc atom as observed for 2 in this study (Table 1 and Figure 2a). In this binding mode, the sulfur atom is located 1.9-2.4 Å from the Zn, probably in a deprotonated form. Moreover, diffraction studies have shown that the S1 subsite is fitted by the benzyl groups of these inhibitors and the S2 subsite by hydrophobic residues, the S1 subsite remaining empty. In this study, we show for the first time that mercaptoacyldipeptides, with Ki values in the 10-8 M range, such as compounds 3 and 4, interact with the S1 subsite of TLN. In this case, the pentacoordination of the Zn atom corresponds to a trigonal bipyramid, and the side chains of AA1 and AA2 now interact with subsites S1 and S2 (Table 1) (Figure 2b,c). These observations could account for the high affinity of these mercaptoacyldipeptides for TLN. With this aim, two kinds of interactions have to be taken into account: (i) the binding of the inhibitor with the Zn atom and neighboring residues and (ii) the interactions of the inhibitor side chains with S1, S1, and S2 subsites. Zn Coordination Sphere. Compared to a tetrahedral geometry, the pentacoordination of Zn found in 3 and 4 implies new electrostatic interactions in the vicinity of the zinc atom (Figure 2b,c and Table 4). In previous crystal structures of TLN cocrystallized with mercapto inhibitors and characterized by a Zn2+ tetracoordination, the thiol group, located at 1.9-2.4 Å from the metal ion, was proposed to be deprotonated (at pH 8) because the Zn2+ ion is expected to act as a Lewis acid by lowering the pKa value of the SH group. However, in the structures presented here (compounds 3 and 4), the OE1 of Glu143 is located 3.1 Å from the sulfur atom. The distance is too small to consider the possibility that both the sulfhydryl and carboxylate functions are negatively charged. Furthermore, the OE1,,,S-CR angle of 116° and the CD-OE1,,,S angle of 128° suggest that OE1 and S are H-bonded and consequently that at least one of these atoms is protonated. The second ligand of the zinc atom is the oxygen of the mercaptoacyl function in inhibitors 3 and 4. It is located 2.4 Å from Zn2+ in both structures. However, this atom is also

12576 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 39, 1999 proline (compound 1), substituted prolines (compound 2), or tricyclic structure (compound 7). If we analyze the affinities of the different inhibitors for the TLN-related enzymes, ACE and NEP, large differences are observed. Thus, in the case of ACE, all the R-mercaptoacyl dipeptides, except 6, have nanomolar or sub-nanomolar Ki values. Due to the well-known ability of the S1 subsite to accept hydrophobic linear or aromatic side chains, the interaction with ACE is optimized with these molecules interacting very likely with the S1, S1, and S2 subsites and acting as zinc bidentates. As in the case of TLN, the substitution of R1 ) CH2-Ph in 5 with H (compound 6) decreases the affinity for ACE by a factor 30, illustrating the existence of hydrophobic interactions in the S1 subsite. In contrast with TLN and ACE, no significant variations in Ki values for the inhibitors were observed for NEP. Thus, all the R-mercaptoacyl dipeptides 1-5 have Ki values in the nanomolar range, as do thiorphan 8 and compound 9, which recognize only the S1 and S2 subsites, suggesting that their mode of binding to the peptidase is similar, as previously proposed (14). It is well-known that the S2 subsite of NEP, as well as that of TLN, does not recognize proline derivatives or bulky cyclic structures (39), meaning that the C-terminal residues of 1, 2, and 7 are located outside the active site. This shows the minor stabilizing role of the putative S1 subsite in NEP already underlined with compounds such as phosphinic-containing inhibitors R1-P(O)OH-CH2CH(R1)CONH(R2)COOH (40), which exhibit only a slightly increased affinity for NEP compared to that of thiorphan despite the topologically imposed presence of a P1 side chain. This could suggest that the S1 subsite of NEP is probably different and/or less accessible than that of TLN or ACE. In conclusion, a new mode of thermolysin recognition has been characterized in this work with a bidentation of the zinc atom by both a thiol and an oxygen group, opening the way for the design of new types of inhibitors.
