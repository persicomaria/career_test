The solution structure of obtustatin, a novel non-RGD disintegrin of 41 residues isolated from Vipera lebetina obtusa venom, and a potent and selective inhibitor of the adhesion of integrin a1b1 to collagen IV, has been determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. Almost the whole set of chemical shifts for 1H, 13C and 15N were assigned at natural abundance from 2D homonuclear and heteronuclear 500 MHz, 600 MHz and 800 MHz spectra at pH 3.0 recorded at 298 K and 303 K. Final structural constraints consisted of 302 non-redundant NOE (95 long-range, 60 medium, 91 sequential and 56 intra-residue), four disulfide bond distances, five x1 dihedral angles and four hydrogen bonds. The 20 conformers with lowest total energy had no NOE violations greater than ° 0.35 A or dihedral angle violations greater than 128. The average rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) for backbone atoms of all residues ° ° among the 20 conformers was 1.1 A and 0.6 A for the 29 best-defined residues. Obtustatin lacks any secondary structure. Compared to all known disintegrin structures in which the RGD motif is located at the apex of an 11 residue hairpin loop, the active KTS tripeptide of obtustatin is oriented towards a side of its nine residue integrin-binding loop. The C-terminal tail is near to the active loop, and these two structural elements display the largest atomic displacements due to local conformational disorder. Double cross-peaks for W20, Y28 and H27 in the aromatic region of TOCSY spectra, local RMSD values for these residues, and positive cross-peaks in a ROESY spectrum (600 MHz, 100 ms mixing time), suggest that these residues act as a hinge allowing for the overall flexibility of the entire integrin-binding loop. These distinct structural features, along with its different electrostatic surface potential in relation to other known disintegrins, may confer to obtustatin its reported a1b1 integrin inhibitory selectivity.

molecular mass, cysteine-rich peptides present in the venoms of Viperidae and Crotalidae snake species, initially characterized as platelet aggregation inhibitors.1,2 Since the early characterization of the first two disintegrins, trigramin3 and echistatin4 from the venoms of Trimeresurus gramineus and Echis carinatus (¼ E. sochureki), respectively, close to 50 disintegrins have been isolated from viper and rattlesnake genera over the last decade, and their primary structures have been elucidated. Disintegrins are derived proteolytically from the PII and PIII class of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMP) composed of pre pro-metalloproteinase, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich (PIII) domains,5 ­ 7 and may be

divided into five different groups according to their polypeptide length and number of disulfide bonds. The first group includes short disintegrins, including echistatin, eristocophin, eristostatin and ocellatusin, which are composed of 49­ 51 residues and four disulfide bonds.8 ­ 11 The second group comprises the medium sized disintegrins, which contain about 70 amino acid residues and six disulfide bonds;8,12 ­ 14 most of the more than 50 different disintegrins characterized to date, including trigramin, kistrin, flavoridin, albolabrin and barbourin, belong to this group. The third group includes the long disintegrin bitistatin, an 84 residue polypeptide cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds,15 and salmosin-3.16 The disintegrin domains of PIII-SVMPs containing about 100 amino acid residues with 16 cysteine residues involved in the formation of eight disulfide bonds2,5 ­ 7,17 constitute the fourth group of the disintegrin family. Unlike short, medium and long disintegrins, which are single-chain molecules, the fifth group is composed of homo- and heterodimers.2 Dimeric disintegrins like contortrostatin, EC3, EC6, CC8 and EMF-1018 ­ 22 contain subunits of about 67 residues with ten cysteine residues involved in the formation of four intra-chain disulfide bonds and two inter-chain cystine linkages.23 Bilitoxin-1 represents a unique homodimeric disintegrin comprising disulfidebonded polypeptides each containing 15 cysteinyl residues.24 Disintegrins are potent and relatively specific inhibitors that compete with, and prevent the binding of, adhesive ligands to integrin receptors of the b1 and b3 families.1,2 The integrin inhibitory activity of disintegrins depends on the primary structure of the inhibitory loop, whose active conformation is critically determined by the appropriate pairing of cysteine residues.10 In most single-chain disintegrins the active sequence is the tripeptide RGD,1,2 the exceptions being barbourin and ussuristatin-2, two medium-sized disintegrins possessing an active KGD sequence,25,26 and atrolysin E, which has an MVD motif in its inhibitory loop.7 RGD-containing disintegrins show different binding affinity and selectivity towards integrins which recognize the RGD sequence in their ligands (i.e. aIIbb3, avb3 and a5b1).27 KGD-containing barbourin inhibits the aIIbb3 integrin with a high degree of selectivity.25 NMR studies of several short (echistatin) and medium (kistrin, flavoridin, albolabrin) disintegrins revealed that the active RGD tripeptide is located at the apex of a mobile loop protruding ° 14 ­17 A from the protein core.12,28 ­ 30 Dimeric disintegrins exhibit the largest sequence diversity in their integrin binding motifs and are selective and potent antagonist of integrins a5b1 (VGD and MGD motifs), a4b1, a4b7 and a9b1 (MLD sequence).19,20 The presence of a WGD motif in the heterodimeric disintegrin CC8 isolated from the venom of the North African sand viper, Cerastes cerastes cerastes, has been reported to increase its inhibitory effect on aIIbb3, avb3 and a5b1 integrins.22

Recently, we isolated and characterized a novel short disintegrin, obtustatin, from the venom of the viper Vipera lebetina obtusa.31 Obtustatin is a unique disintegrin in several aspects. With only 41 residues, it represents the smallest disintegrin reported to date, and contains an integrinrecognition loop which is two residues shorter than that of other disintegrins and whose amino acid sequence (WKTSLTSHY) departs strongly from the primary structure of the RGD motifcontaining loops of all known disintegrins. This novel integrin-binding loop endows obtustatin with selective inhibitory activity of the in vitro adhesion of integrin a1b1 to collagen IV.31 The critical role of integrin a1b1 in VEGF-driven angiogenesis in the dermis has been established.32 In a recent report, obtustatin was found to be a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, and also impaired by about 50% the development of Lewis lung tumor in the mouse.33 Hence, obtustatin represents a potential lead molecule for the design of peptidomimetic inhibitors of angiogenesis in cancer therapy. With this aim, we report here the three-dimensional solution structure of obtustatin determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance.

Results and Discussion
Sequential assignment Two-dimensional NMR spectra of obtustatin (3.3 mM, pH 3.0, 298 K) showed good chemical shift dispersion in the range 9.9­ 6.9 ppm and the sequential assignments of about 60% of the proton resonances was straightforward. Peak overlapping was observed for the NH signals of residues C6, L12, C19, T22, S23, H27, G31 and C36 at 8.2 ppm and L24 and L38 at 7.8 ppm, but were unambiguously assigned in H,H-2D-NOESY and H,H-2D-TOCSY spectra recorded at two different temperatures, 298 K and 303 K. Analysis at natural isotope abundance in a 2D [1H,15N]HSQC spectrum recorded in the cryoprobe of a 600 MHz spectrometer also helped to resolve signal overlaps and amino acid spin system identification. Except for the 13Ca of G41, 13C chemical shifts were completely assigned for all residues of obtustatin by 2D [1H,13C]HSQC and 2D [1H,13C]HSQC-TOCSY (tm, 25 ms) spectra recorded in conventional 500 MHz and 800 MHz spectrometers at natural abundance. The 2D [1H,13C]HSQC-TOCSY was particularly useful for checking many of the 13Ca, 13 b C and 13Cg resonances, and for the assignments of the Ha of T2, Hb of T22, and Hb and Hg of T30. The data allowed sequential assignment of the polypeptide stretches 1 ­3, 7 ­12, and 16 ­35 via daN and/or dNN NOEs. Noteworthy, aromatic protons of W20, H27 and Y28 yielded double TOCSY and NOEs cross-peaks, indicating that these residues may have existed in two alternate

Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis of obtustatin was performed in a 0.1 cm quartz cell under nitrogen atmosphere at 27 8C using a 0.2 nm spectral step size, a 2.0 nm bandwidth and a 100 nm/minute scan rate.

conformations. The remaining, proline-containing, amino acid segments (G4P5-C6, K13-P14-A15, C36-P37-L38-T39-P40-G41) were sequentially assigned via dab NOEs. Strong cross-peak NOEs between Ha(i)/Hd(i þ 1) of G4/P5, K13/P14, C36/ P37 and T39/P40 indicated that the four proline residues adopted the trans-conformation. As a whole, proton, carbon and nitrogen assignments of obtustatin were nearly complete, and the 1H, 13 C and 15N chemical shifts have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (entry 5410). Missing resonance assignments include the Ha and Ca of G41 and the HNe and HN side-chain protons of arginine, lysine and glutamine amino acid residues. Structure determination A total of 110 meaningful NOEs were identified manually over the spectra and used as starting data for further extension of the NOESY spectra assignment by running 24 calculation cycles in the NOAH34,35 protocol. A proton chemical shift tolerance of 0.015 ppm was allowed for the automatic assignment of NOEs. In separate experiments, each of the two possible patterns of disulfide bonds (see below) was added as upper and lower limit distance restraints to the NOAH calculations. Every proton resonance assigned in the amino acid sequence had at least a manually assigned peak as recommended by the NOAH authors. A final set of 302 meaningful NOEs were unambiguously identified over the obtustatin amino acid sequence using the NOAH standard protocol. No NOE peak calibration was performed in the NOAH calculations and maximum observable distances were chosen because of the possible relaxation contribution associated with the expected high segmental mobility of the protein taking into consideration the NMR solution structures of other disintegrins12,28 ­ 30 and initial calculations using manually assigned NOEs. Furthermore, the CD spectrum displayed in Figure 1 is typical of an irregular structure dominated by the contributions of aromatic side-chains and disulfide bonds, and shows clearly the absence of a-helix (positive maximum at 192 nm and negative peaks at 209 nm and 222 nm), b-turns or parallel b-sheet (positive at
 http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu

206 nm) and antiparallel b-sheet (negative at 218 nm and positive at 196 nm). In contrast, circular dichroism spectra of echistatin reported by Saudek et al.28 and Chen et al.36 were characterized by a minimum at 188 ­ 189 nm, a broad shoulder with negative ellipticity around 204 nm, and a weak maximum at approximately 225 nm. The estimated contributions of a-helix, b-turns, b-sheets, and random-coil conformations were 2­ 8%, 27 ­ 33%, 24 ­36%, and 28­ 34%, respectively. For structure refinement, all NOEs were classified by their intensities as strong, medium or weak corresponding to upper bounds of 3.0, 4.0 ° and 5.0 A, respectively. Upper limits of methylene, methyl and aromatic protons were adjusted using standard pseudo-atom correction.37 Figure 2 summarizes the distribution of NOE distance constraints and the slow chemical exchange amide proton for each residue of obtustatin. The NOAH semi-automatic structure calculation scheme provided highly folded structures that were of medium resolution. Higher resolution and convergence was achieved by standard simulated annealing procedure in DYANA.38 Stereo-specific assignments and corresponding x1 dihedral angles restraints were obtained from 2D H,H-TOCSY and 2D H,H-NOESY spectra at short mixing times using methods described elsewhere.39,40 Final structural constraints consisted of 302 non-redundant inter-proton distances from NOE, four disulfide bonds restraints, five x1 dihedral angles and four hydrogen bond restraints. NOE constraints were composed of 95 long-range, 60 medium, 91 sequential and 56 intra-residue constraints (Table 1). The large amount of long-range NOEs is typical of a good folded protein. The best 50 structures of 1000 generated in DYANA were subsequently refined by the simulated annealing standard protocol in X-PLOR,41 and the 20 structures with the lowest total energy were considered as representatives of the obtustatin solution conformers (Figure 3). None of these structures had NOE violations ° greater than 0.35 A or dihedral angle violations greater than 128. A summary of the structural constraints and statistics of the final obtustatin structure ensemble is given in Table 2. A total of 78% of the non-glycine and non-proline residues were found in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, with 8% of residues in the disallowed region (Table 2). Residues R8 and K32 consistently

exhibited positive f angles. This situation is typical of medium resolution NMR structures. However, this criterion should be more flexible for molecules that, like obtustatin, are characterized by the absence of regular secondary structure. Lower quality Ramachandran plot statistics have also been reported for the NMR structures of disintegrins kistrin,12 echistatin,28 and flavoridin.29 The obtustatin structure coordinates have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (accession code 1MPZ). Disulfide bonds Obtustatin contains eight cysteine residues involved in the formation of four disulfide linkages.31 Assignment of disulfide bonds using

protein chemical in conjunction with mass spectrometric techniques13,15,17,23 did not work with obtustatin because it was resistant to degradation with oxalic acid for 48 hours at 100 8C. Nevertheless, though the exact cysteine pairing of obtustatin has not been established, the position and spacing of the eight cysteine residues are absolutely conserved in echistatin and eristostatin (Figure 4), suggesting that obtustatin may share with these short disintegrins their experimentally determined cystine linkages (1 ­ 10, 6­ 29, 7 ­34, and 19 ­36 in the obtustatin sequence shown in Figures 2 and 4).8,10 To assess this point, we followed the local and global analysis of NMR data strategy proposed by Klaus et al.14 in the disulfide bond mapping of the disintegrin flavoridin. The 13Cb chemical shifts of the eight cysteine residues were measured in a [1H,13C]HSQC experiment at natural abundance. Chemical shifts of all eight Cb of cysteine residues were located at a strongly down field-shifted region in the range 35 ppm to 41.5 ppm, confirming the engagement of the eight cysteine residues in disulfide bridges.42 Hb ­ Hb NOE cross-peaks between the C1/C10 and C19/ C36 in NOESY spectrum at 100 ms were clearly identified. These disulfide linkages are conserved in the homologous disintegrins echistatin and eristostatin. However, overlapping NOE crosspeaks for the Hb ­ Hb resonances of C7 and C34, and of C6 and C29 precluded at this stage the unambiguous determination of these two disulfides. Either pattern of disulfide bonds (pattern I, C7 ­ C34, C6 ­ C29; pattern II, C7 ­ C29,

each alternative disulfide combination were computed by addition of the standard three upper and three lower distances constraints.43 In these calculations, disulfide bond constraints were added to the input of 302 NOE upper limit distance constraints. Results of these calculations are reported in Table 3, and show that the structure calculation with the disulfide constraints set I converged with only a very slight increase of the residual DYANA target function value in comparison to the calculation performed without disulfide bond constraints (the mean structure for this set of calculations is shown in blue in Figure 5a). Structures obtained with alternative disulfide combination, C1 ­ C10, C19 ­ C36, C7 ­ C29, C6 ­C34 resulted in larger values of target function and van der Waals repulsive interactions (the mean structure for this set of calculations is shown in red in Figure 5a). These results indicated better structural, stereochemical and geometrical agreement between the set of disulfide bridges C1 ­C10, C19 ­ C36, C7 ­ C34, C6 ­ C29 and NOE data. This disulfide bond pattern is identical with that of echistatin, which has been determined experimentally by chemical methods.8,9 The final structure of obtustatin, including the assigned disulfide bonds and ribbon radius proportional to root-meansquare deviation (RMSD) value for backbone atoms ("sausage representation" as described by Koradi et al.44), is displayed in Figure 5(B). Description of the structure The structure of obtustatin can be described as a bundle of loops protruding from a compact core maintained by a network of four disulfide bonds, and is devoid of secondary structure elements. The lack of distinct regular structural elements was clearly supported by NMR data, as summarized in Figure 3. The 1H ­ 2H exchange experiment showed that the amide hydrogen atoms of C6, C7, K13, C19, T17 and C29 were in slowexchanging kinetics and therefore may be hydrogen-bonded or formed part of the hydrophobic core of the protein. 3JNHa coupling constant values estimated from DQF-COSY cross-peaks were

always greater than 8 Hz, with the exception of C29, supporting the absence of regular secondary structure elements for obtustatin. Although 3 JHN ­ Ha values greater than 8 Hz are usually taken as indicating beta structure, in obtustatin these values were restricted to isolated residues dispersed along the sequence (Figure 2). Moreover, 13 a 13 b C , C and 1Ha chemical-shift index values also indicated consistently a lack of any particular secondary structure element. This conclusion was in full agreement with circular dichroism spectroscopy of obtustatin (Figure 1). The threedimensional structure of obtustatin (Figure 3) resembles that of echistatin (2ECH),28 its closer disintegrin homologue. However, the obtustatin fold also possess distinct structural features that will be highlighted and discussed below. The structure of obtustatin is well defined, with 70% of the residues among the 20 conformers ° exhibiting RMSD values of less than 0.6 A, and backbone angular order parameters greater than 0.90 for most residue backbone atoms. Obtustatin conformers (Figure 3) display an overall RMSD of ° 1.1 A with respect to the mean structure, and this ° value was 0.42 A if only the backbone atoms of the well-defined residues 4­ 18 and 30­ 36 were superimposed. Compared to other disintegrins whose molecular architectures have been determined by NMR methods, the structure of

obtustatin is of higher stereochemical quality, i.e. ° ° ° RMSD values of 1.7 A, 2.5 A and 1.89 A have been reported for the backbone atoms of all residues with respect to the mean structure of kistrin,12 echistatin28 and flavoridin,29 respectively. Less well defined regions include the polypeptide stretches 19­ 29 and 35­ 41, which correspond, respectively, to the integrin-binding loop and the C-terminal tail (Figure 3). The integrinbinding loop of obtustatin harbors the KTS tripeptide motif, which is largely responsible for the disintegrin's affinity and selectivity for integrin a1b1.31 The C-terminal tail of echistatin, which in obtustatin and in the other reported disintegrin structures12,28 ­ 30 as well, is located in the proximity

of, and almost parallel with, the integrin-specificity loop, has been reported to contain essential epitopes for the induction of LIBS (ligand-induced binding site) epitopes.1,2,27 In obtustatin, this proximity is partly maintained by a disulfide bond between C19 and C36, and is confirmed by experimental NOE cross-peaks between CHg-T18/Hb3 C36, Ha-C19/Hd-P37, HN-C19/Hb-C36, HN-W20/ Hb-C36 and Hb-K21/HN-Y39. Noteworthy is the latter interaction involving K21, a residue of obtustatin's integrin-binding motif.31 Although the functional relevance of the C-terminal region of obtustatin has not been investigated, the mobility of this polypeptide stretch and of the integrinbinding loop, and their close spatial association, may represent important features of obtustatin, and other disintegrins, which enable them to bind and block their target integrin receptors through a "zipper" model of multiple interaction points. Noteworthy is superposition of the backbone atoms of the integrin recognition motif, 21KTS23, among the final 20 conformers of obtustatin ° exhibiting a RMSD value of 0.4 A with respect to the mean structure, indicating that these residues adopt a well-defined conformation. On the other hand, double signals in the aromatic region corresponding to W20, H27, and Y28 clearly indicated that side-chains for these residues, which are located at the base of the integrin-binding loop, may exist in alternative conformations in a slow exchange process. Backbone resonances of residues W20, H27, and Y28 did not exhibit double signals, ruling out the existence of two conformations of the protein backbone. In addition, W20, H27, and Y28 are among those residues displaying the

largest local RMSD value. This suggested an increased range of motion for these residues and that they may act as a hinge, endowing the whole integrin-binding loop of obtustatin with overall flexibility. The slow exchange process hypothesized to underlie the double signals of the sidechains of W20, H27, and Y28 was confirmed by the observation of positive cross-peaks in a ROESY spectrum at 600 MHz and with a 100 ms mixing time. Slow exchange motions were restricted to the side-chains of these three residues. Hence, the "hinge mechanism" may not represent a slow exchange between two loop conformations but rather reflects increased flexibility and range of motion of the whole integrin binding loop. The possibility that the flexibility of the loop arises from isomerization around the disulfide bonds C19 ­ C36 and C6 ­C29 located at the base of the integrin-binding loop was also discarded. Thus, both disulfide bridges adopt a trans conformation in more than 90% of the final models. On the other hand, broadening of Cb ­ Hb cross-peaks for cysteine residues, which would be indicative of slow exchange processes, was not observed in the 13 C-HSQC spectrum, while many cross-peaks corresponding to aromatic side-chains of W20, H27 and Y28 did show significant broadening and overlapping. The "hinge mechanism" proposed for the integrin-binding loop of obtustatin has not been reported for any other disintegrin structure, and may be linked to the lack in obtustatin of the otherwise conserved short regions of antiparallel b-sheet found at both ends of the integrin-binding loops of disintegrins with solved NMR structures, including echistatin,28 kistrin,12 flavoridin,29 and

142 albolabrin.30 Other unique structural features of obtustatin's integrin-recognition loop are its length, which is two residues shorter than that of all known disintegrins,31 and the disposition of the integrin-specificity residues, which are oriented towards a side of the active loop instead of at the apex of a b-hairpin as in the RGD-containing disintegrin structures. A comparison of the mean conformations of the integrin binding loops of the RGD-containing disintegrin echistatin and of obtustatin is depicted in Figure 4. Differences in loop size, composition, and flexibility, along with the distinct orientation of the KTS tripeptide may have important functional consequences. Thus, whereas in the recent crystal structure of the extracellular segments of integrin avb3 in complex with an RGD ligand45 the side-chains of arginine 24 and aspartatic acid 26 of the RGD motif participate in an extensive network of polar interactions with av b-propeller and b3 bA-domain residues, respectively, in obtustatin the most critical residue for blocking the a1b1 integrin ­ collagen IV interaction is the threonine residue in the middle of the KTS motif.31 Surface electrostatic potential distribution The chemical nature and distribution of surfaceexposed functional groups are responsible for the molecular reactivity of a protein. The surface electrostatic potential distribution of obtustatin (Figure 6) was calculated using standard MOLMOL protocols.44 Differences in charge distribution between obtustatin and other disintegrins, including the RGD-containing disintegrins echistatin (2ECH), kistrin (1KST), and flavoridin (1FLV) (Figure 6) may underlay their different integrin inhibition selectivities. Except for the central part of the "front" view, which displays a neutral patch, and a small negatively charged loop protruding from the core, obtustatin exhibits a predominantly positive charged surface. In contrast, echistatin, kistrin, and flavoridin show a clearly net negative patch in the "back" view. Noteworthy, the integrin-binding loop and the carboxy-terminal tail of obtustatin are mainly neutral, whereas these regions are clearly negative in the RGD-containing disintegrins, with the exception of the integrinbinding loop of kistrin, which is mainly negative but with a small positive patch. Concluding remarks The NMR solution structure of obtustatin reported here represents the first three-dimensional structure of a non-RGD-containing disintegrin. Its shortened integrin-binding loop among known disintegrins, which expresses a distinctly localized and novel KTS motif, and appears to be articulated by a hinge mechanism for overall binding loop flexibility, along with its non-disintegrin-conserved distribution of surface-exposed positively charged functional groups, underlie the

structural basis of obtustatin's unique selectivity and specificity for integrin a1b1. Further work is underway to define at atomic resolution the integrin inhibition mechanism of obtustatin.

Experimental Procedures
Purification of obtustatin and sample preparation Obtustatin was purified from the venom of Vipera lebetina obtusa (Latoxan, France) using two steps of reverse-phase HPLC as described.31 The yield was 12 mg of purified obtustatin per gram of crude venom. The purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and MALDITOF mass spectrometry (using an Applied Biosystems DE-Pro spectrometer and a-hydroxycinammic acid saturated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetate (TFA) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile as matrix). The isotope-averaged molecular mass (M þ Hþ) of native obtustatin was 4394.2 Da, which matches the calculated mass from its amino acid sequence accurately, as shown in Figures 3 and 531 (SwissProt accession number P83469). CD spectroscopy For determination of the secondary structure content, CD spectra (185­ 250 nm) of obtustatin (20 mM in water in a 0.1 cm quartz cell) were measured under nitrogen atmosphere at 300 K on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter employing the following conditions: 0.2 nm spectral step size, a 2.0 nm bandwidth and a 100 nm/minute scan rate. Five scans were averaged and solvent corrected. Ellipticity was expressed as the mean residue ellipticity (Q) in deg. cm2/dmol. NMR spectroscopy For NMR analyses, obtustatin was dissolved in 10% H2O/90% H2O or 100% 2H2O at a final concentration of 3.3 mM in a 5 mm Wilmad NMR tube, and the solution was adjusted to pH 3.0 with HCl. For 1H ­ 2H exchange experiments, the sample was freeze-dried and reconstituted in 2H2O. All 2D NMR data spectra were recorded on Bruker Advance NMR 500 and 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with a conventional TBI probe or an NMR 600 MHz instrument with a triple resonance cryoprobe. The spectra were processed on an SGI O2 workstation running the XWIN-NMR version 3.1 software and analyzed with SPARKY version 3.96 software.46 Two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra were recorded in phase sensitive mode using a time proportional phase increments (TPPI) method for quadrature detection in the t1 dimension.47 Homonuclear 2D spectra were collected at 298 K and 303 K and included double-quantum filtered (DQF)-COSY48 with the phase-cycle modified for fast recycle times, H,H-2D-TOCSY49 with a spin-lock period of 15 ms, 50 ms and 80 ms, H,H-2D-NOESY50 with mixing times of 50 ms, 100 ms and 200 ms and H,H-2D-ROESY with a mixing time of 100 ms. Heteronuclear 2D spectra were recorded at natural abundance and included 2D [1H,13C]HSQC and 2D [1H,13C]HSQCTOCSY with 25 ms mixing time. The 2D [1H,15N]HSQC spectra were collected on the cryoprobe of the NMR 600 MHz spectrometer. Solvent signal-suppression was achieved either by using the WATERGATE pulse sequence51 or by low-power irradiation at the water resonance frequency. A recycling relaxation delay of

1.3 seconds between transients was employed in all 2D experiments. Sequence-specific assignment was performed using standard methodology for homonuclear NMR.52 Stereospecific assignments and side-chain x1 dihedral angles were determined using standard strategies described elsewhere.38 Protons involved in hydrogen bonding were detected by slow hydrogen/ deuterium exchange NMR experiments. Structure calculation Data for structure calculations were determined from NOE experiments and analysis of the assignments. Models of obtustatin were calculated by simulated annealing torsion angle dynamics using DYANA.38 A total of 1000 conformers were generated in a random fashion and 800 steps of optimization were applied yielding an initial subset of structures compatible with the manually derived NMR data. The best 50 conformers were selected for further NOESY assignments and recalibration using the semi-automated NOE assignment NOAH34,35 routine implemented in the DYANA software package. The new set of expanded structural restraints was subjected to a further cycle of DYANA simulated annealing torsion angle dynamics calculations for the generation of new conformers. The overall routine of calculation-recalibration was applied until no new distance constraints were derived from NOEs. Fifty conformers with lowest values of target function were selected for further full potential energy function refinement with the X-PLOR molecular dynamics program.41 Standard X-PLOR protocols for simulated annealing, including stages of weight annealing and temperature annealing, were used for structure refinement. The initial set of calculations was performed with no disulfide bonding information to evaluate possible disulfide bond patterns by sulfur atom proximity. Two different possible patterns were identified and two new sets of calculations were done. The final disulfide bond pattern was selected by van der Waals criteria over models calculated for each possibility. Electrostatic surface potential The surface electrostatic potential distribution of the best overall models of obtustatin was calculated with MOLMOL44 based on simple Coulomb interactions and implicit hydrogen atom positions. Solvent accessibility was calculated with PROCHECK53 and residues with accessibility values larger than 0.5 were assigned as solvent exposed. Atom charges and the protonation state of amino acid residues were derived with the "pdb_charge" MOLMOL macro with adequate corrections for secondary structure conformations by interpolation to pH 6. Protein Data Bank accession number The coordinates of the ensemble of 20 structures of obtustatin have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession code 1MPZ.
