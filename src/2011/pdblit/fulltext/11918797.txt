Summary MotA is a transcription factor from bacteriophage T4 that helps adapt the host Escherichia coli transcription apparatus to T4 middle promoters. We have determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of MotA (MotCF) to 1.6 Å resolution using multiwavelength, anomalous diffraction methods. The structure reveals a novel DNA-binding a/b motif that contains an exposed b-sheet surface that mediates interactions with the DNA. Independent biochemical experiments have shown that MotCF binds to one surface of a single turn of DNA through interactions in adjacent major and minor grooves. We present a model of the interaction in which b-ribbons at opposite corners of the six-stranded b-sheet penetrate the DNA grooves, and call the motif a `double wing' to emphasize similarities to the `winged-helix' motif. The model is consistent with data on how MotA functions at middle promoters, and provides an explanation for why MotA can form non-specific multimers on DNA. Introduction The MotA transcription factor from bacteriophage T4 is specifically required for the expression of middle-mode genes during the phage infection cycle of Escherichia coli (Stitt and Hinton, 1994). Middle-mode promoters represent a compromise between the early promoters that resemble those of the host (Wilkens and Rüger, 1994) and late promoters that require a phage-encoded sigma (s) factor (Williams et al., 1994). The consensus T4 middle promoter comprises a ­30 sequence, the `mot box', recognized by MotA (Uzan et al., 1985; Hinton, 1991; Schmidt and Kreuzer, 1992; March-Amegadzie and Hinton, 1995; Marshall et al., 1999) and a host-like ­10 region. The E. coli RNA polymerase is `adapted' to this modified architecture through interactions involving elements of MotA and another phage-encoded protein, AsiA, that binds to the s70 subunit (Stevens, 1977). It has been shown that the host polymerase, MotA and AsiA are necessary and sufficient for expression of T4 middlemode genes (Hinton, 1991; Schmidt and Kreuzer, 1992; Orsini et al., 1993; Ouhammouch et al., 1995). We have demonstrated previously that MotA contains two domains that can be readily separated by proteolysis (Finnin et al., 1993). The structure of the MotA N-terminal domain (MotNF) has been determined by both X-ray crystallography (Finnin et al., 1997) and NMR spectroscopy (Li et al., 2001), and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have established that MotNF interacts with the host transcriptional machinery (Gerber and Hinton, 1996; Finnin et al., 1997). A preliminary NMR structure of the MotA C-terminal domain (MotCF) has also been determined (Finnin et al., 1994), and gel mobility-shift assays using DNA fragments containing the mot-box sequence (unpublished data) reveal that it is responsible for anchoring MotA to the ­30 region of the middle promoter. Here, we report the 1.6 Å crystal structure of MotCF, and present a preliminary model of how it interacts with DNA, consistent with experimental data. The domain represents a novel DNA-binding motif that appears to bind as a monomer to adjacent major and minor grooves. Results Purification and crystallization The gene for the C-terminal domain of MotA (MotCF, amino acids 104­211) was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET3C (Novagen), and MotCF was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells. Uniformly seleniumlabelled MotCF (SeMet MotCF) was obtained by transforming 834(DE3) cells with the pET3C plasmid

containing the MotCF gene, and growing these cells in defined media (Neidhardt et al., 1974) containing selenomethionine. The protein was purified in two steps using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Initial crystallization trials were performed with commercially available screening kits. The final optimal condition for growing native MotCF crystals was 23% PEG 8000, 0.12 M sodium acetate, 0.10 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 3% glycerol. The SeMet MotCF crystals grew from 19% PEG 8000, 35 mM potassium phosphate pH 5.0, 3% glycerol. Crystals appeared overnight and, within 10­14 days, grew to be quite large with dimensions of 1.0 mm ¥ 1.0 mm ¥ 1.5 mm. Both native and SeMet crystals grew in space group P1, but with slightly different unit cell parameters: native, a = 31.2 Å, b = 54.4 Å, c = 86.0 Å, a = 87.5, b = 87.6, g =83.8; SeMet, a = 31.3 Å, b = 54.7 Å, c = 91.5 Å, a = 94.7, b = 91.1, g = 95.6. Assuming a typical packing density of approximately 2.3 Å3 per dalton for the high quality MotCF crystals (Matthews, 1968), it can be estimated that there are six molecules in the P1 unit cell, which also represents the asymmetric unit of the crystal. Structure determination The structure of MotCF was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) methods using the SeMet crystals. Data were collected at the peak, inflection point and high energy remote wavelengths of selenium. The pertinent statistics are presented in Table 1. Following several rounds of Patterson searches and difference Fouriers, the locations of 31 definitive selenium

atoms were identified in the unit cell, and these were used in a MAD phasing calculation at 1.8 Å resolution. The experimental electron density map after density modification (Fig. 1A) was of sufficient quality to allow the identification of the six predicted MotCF molecules in the unit cell. The map also allowed a preliminary interpretation of the structure guided by the known secondary structure of MotCF from NMR measurements (Finnin et al., 1994). Several iterative rounds of model building, refinement and phase combination resulted in a high quality map in which all six molecules in the asymmetric unit were clearly visible (Fig. 1B). This process was facilitated by the noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) relating the six MotCF molecules in the unit cell. The final model was refined at 1.6 Å without NCS restraints with Rwork and Rtest values of 22.6% and 25.8% respectively. Phasing and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2. The original experimental map was of relatively poor quality, and this prompted us to confirm the validity of the final model using two independent methods. First, a follow-up MAD phasing calculation was performed using the 39 visible selenium atoms in the unit cell. Although 42 selenium atoms should have been present (seven per molecule), three of the Nterminal methionines were missing from the final model. After density modification, the new experimental electron density map was much improved (Fig. 1C) and agreed perfectly with the model. Second, a series of simulated annealing omit maps were calculated in each of which a different random region of the model was deleted. The way in which MotCF is packed in the crystal is somewhat unusual and, as will be described later, may have some biological significance.

metric unit, six MotCF monomers (A to F) associate into three similar, but non-identical, dimers in which the monomers interact via the exposed edges of their bsheets (Fig. 2A). This packing arrangement may represent an efficient way of stabilizing the exposed edges of the MotCF b-sheets that form pseudo-continuous layers along the b-axis of the crystal. Two types of dimer are present in the crystal that are generated by a parallel b5/ b5 interaction (Fig. 2B) and an antiparallel b1/ b1 interaction (Fig. 2C), and either one of these dimeric units could potentially be an asymmetric unit in a more regularly packed crystal. The six molecules in the asymmetric unit are all very similar, and the only significant differences occur at the N-terminus, and at the two peripheral turns connecting the outermost b-strands. However, as can be seen from the B factors listed in Table 2, monomers A, B and C are slightly better resolved than monomers D, E

and F. Consistent with this, four, five and four residues, respectively, are not visible at the N-termini of these latter three monomers. Overall structure of MotCF MotCF has a compact a/ b structure (Fig. 3) comprising three a-helices and six b-strands in the order: a1- b1b2- b3- b4- a2- b5- b6- a3 (Fig. 4). The b-strands form a single anti-parallel b-sheet in the topological order b1/ b2/ b3/ b4/ b6/ b5, and the three a-helices pack side-by-side onto one surface of the b-sheet in the order a1/ a3/ a2. In this very simple architecture, the domain's hydrophobic core is at the sheet­helix interface, and the second surface of the b-sheet is completely exposed. The three a-helices are oriented with their axes approximately coincident with those of the b-strands in the b-sheet. Helix

a1 is N-capped by Thr107 and C-capped by Asn124, and it has a C-terminal Gly125 that mediates a sharp turn into the following b1 strand. Methionines 110 and 117, and leucines 116, 118, 120 and 121 within a1 are important elements of the hydrophobic core. The smallest helix, a2, contributes three residues to the hydrophobic core, isoleucines 172 and 178 and Phe175, and the C-terminal Gly179 permits a sharp turn into the following b5 strand. Helix a3 is N-capped by Ser197, and the C-terminus represents the abrupt ending of the MotCF fold. Helix a3 is centrally located in the fold, and three out of its four sides are engaged in hydrophobic core interactions involving Ile201, alanines 203 and 208, valines 204 and 207, Ile205 and the C-terminal Leu211. The b-sheet has the typical

antiparallel architecture and hydrogen bonding pattern, and is distinctly saddle-shaped due its natural curvature and twist. The only deviation from this regular structure occurs at the N-terminus of strand b1 at which residues 128­130 form a b-bulge structure. The hydrophobic core residues projecting from the b-sheet are leucines 128, 142 and 192, valines 131 and 190, isoleucines 133, 154, 162, 184 and 194, Tyr138, Ala140, Phe152, Met160 and Cys182. Three-quarters of the MotCF residues are confined to the secondary structure elements, and the lack of any extended loop regions produces a rather simple and regular structure. The only loop region of any consequence is the connection between b2 and b3. This loop is highly structured by extensive interactions with the rest of the molecule, and it serves to close off one side of the fold directly beneath the C-terminus (Fig. 3). Only a few hydrophobic core residues are contributed by the small loop regions, namely isoleucines 106 and 149, Phe126 and methionines 167 and 180. A number of the MotCF residues have clear structural roles in the motif. Aspartates 109 and 113, and Arg196 form salt bridge interactions that tie together a1 and the b6-a3 loop. Another salt bridge interaction between Asp193 and Arg161 links strands b4 and b6. In addition, the side chains of several residues participate in specific hydrogen-bonding interactions that further stabilize the fold. The OG oxygen of Ser136 bonds with the amide nitrogen of Glu105 to link the N-terminus to the adjacent b1-b2 turn. The ND2 nitrogen atoms of asparagines 151 and 155 bond to the OE2 oxygen of Glu153 within b3. The NE2 nitrogen of His171 bonds to the OD1 oxygen of Asn147 and also to the carbonyl oxygen of Leu211 to tie together a3, the b2-b3 loop and the C-terminus. The C-terminus is also secured by hydrogen bonds that link the NZ nitrogen of Lys174 and

the carbonyl oxygens of Glu210 and Leu211. Finally, the ND2 nitrogen of Asn200 bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Lys195 to stabilize the b6-a3 turn. Structural homology to other proteins Protein motifs that contain an exposed b-sheet surface are quite unusual, and MotCF superficially resembles notable examples that include the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (Kim et al., 1993a; b) and the RNA recognition motif (RRM) (Nagai et al., 1990). However, the topological arrangements of the secondary structure elements in these proteins are not the same as MotCF. Based on a preliminary analysis of MotCF using NMR techniques (Finnin et al., 1994), we previously suggested that the protein may resemble one half of TBP. Although the majority of the NMR assignments in MotCF have been confirmed by the crystal structure, one strand (b5) was missed completely in the NMR analysis, and residues 113 and 114 were incorrectly placed within the outer strand of the b-sheet. The corrected topology is now markedly different from that of TBP, and we no longer consider the proteins to be structurally homologous. A search of the protein database using the Dali search engine (Holm and Sander, 1995) did reveal some structural homologues, and two are particularly striking. The most similar fold is that of the C-terminal domain of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis that is responsible for the inherited condition Friedreich's ataxia. This domain contains an antiparallel b-sheet and a-helices packed onto one side (Musco et al., 2000) with a topology identical to that of MotCF, but it lacks the equivalent of the b5-a2 segment. The second similarity is to the C-terminal domain of the arginine repressor, (Van Duyne et al., 1996) which is responsible for the binding of L-arginine and the oligomerization of the transcription factor. This domain also has the MotCF topology, but it lacks the equivalent of the a1-b1-b2 segment. Neither of these two domains bind DNA and MotCF, therefore, represents a completely new DNAbinding motif.

The DNA-binding surface of MotCF There are no known orthologues or paralogues of MotA, and it is not possible to use sequence conservation data to help identify the functionally important regions of the molecule. However, the shape of the protein, together with a distinctive clustering of appropriate DNA-binding residues and the electrostatic surface potential strongly suggest that the exposed surface of the b-sheet represents the DNA-binding site. As described above and shown in Fig. 3, the curved b-sheet generates a distinct saddle-shaped surface in which the short turns connecting b1-b2 and b5-b6 are located at opposite corners and represent the `lowest' points as viewed in Fig. 3. This architecture is very reminiscent of that in TBP, the quintessential, saddle-like DNA-binding protein (Kim et al., 1993a; Kim et al., 1993b). The suggestive residues that project from this surface include lysines 129, 130, 144, 166, 183, 186 and 195, arginines 135, 145, 150 and 161, tyrosines 134, 165 and 191, and Phe163 (Figs 4 and 5A). It is unlikely that all of these residues interact with DNA as they cover quite a large surface area. However, they are the types of residues that are typically involved in specific protein­DNA interactions, and the aromatic side chains have the potential for intercalation into DNA. It is also worth noting that the b-bulge structure in strand b1 enables the adjacent lysines 129 and 130 to be both exposed and available for potentially binding to DNA. Finally, this surface has a high electropositive potential that contrasts with the rest of the protein, which is generally neutral or electronegative (Fig. 5B and C). This distinct pattern of surface potential is typical of DNAbinding proteins, and usually reflects the DNA-binding surface. Discussion A model for the MotCF­DNA interaction Biochemically, the interaction between MotA and the motbox DNA cognate sequence has been well characterized. The consensus sequence contains nine base pairs (5¢-

TTTGCTTTA-3¢) (Marshall et al., 1999), and characterization of MotA binding properties with various mot boxes suggests that MotA accesses the minor groove towards the 5¢-end of this sequence and the major groove towards the 3¢-end (Sharma et al., 1999). In addition, MotA binds as a monomer (Cicero et al., 1998) and not as a dimer as we suggested previously, based on the incorrect homology to TBP (Finnin et al., 1994). These data point to a model in which MotA binds onto one surface of the mot box, straddling the sugar-phosphate backbone as it penetrates both the minor and major grooves within one turn of the DNA. Modelling studies show that our MotCF structure can easily accommodate this scenario, although no attempt has been made to produce a detailed model in the absence of firm structural data. The central feature of our proposed interaction is an apparent shape complementarity between the exposed b-sheet surface of MotCF and the groove structure of DNA. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that this surface of MotCF contains two protrusions, a smaller one close to the b1- b2 turn and a larger one close to the b5-b6 turn, and there is a distinct indentation between them. As demonstrated in Fig. 5D, it is possible to dock MotCF and DNA with the smaller protrusion in the

minor groove, the bulky protrusion in the major groove and the sugar-phosphate backbone within the intervening indentation. The apparent flexibility of the `downward' projecting b1-b2 and b5-b6 turns is consistent with the notion that they penetrate the DNA grooves. In our model, the orientation of MotCF with respect to the DNA axis is dictated by the separation between the protrusions, but we emphasize that this is only an approximation as the DNA is likely to be distorted in the complex. MotCF binds DNA in a novel fashion Assuming that our model of the MotCF­DNA complex is generally correct, it represents a new mode of protein­ DNA interaction, consistent with the finding that MotCF adopts a novel DNA-binding motif. It is important to note that the proposed MotCF binding mode is very different from that of the architecturally similar TBP in which the protein mainly accesses the DNA via the minor groove. The most similar example would be the winged-helix motif where, typically, a recognition a-helix penetrates the major groove and a b-ribbon binds within the adjacent minor groove (Gajiwala and Burley, 2000).

Fig. 6. A model of the MotA­DNA complex. The model is not meant to be an accurate representation, and simply demonstrates that the proposed MotCF­DNA complex is generally consistent with how MotA operates at T4 middle promoters. Specifically, the position and orientation of the N-terminal domain of MotA (MotNF) are consistent with the locations of the N-terminus of MotCF, the mot box and the ­35 region, and the AsiA/s70 complex. The residues shown on MotCF are those that potentially bind DNA. The residues indicated on MotNF are those shown to be involved in the interaction with AsiA/s70 (Finnin et al., 1997). For clarity, the Cterminus of MotNF is truncated at Pro92, the N-terminus of MotCF starts at Ile106 and the linking 15 residues of unknown structure are represented as a dashed line. The coordinates of MotNF are taken from the NMR study of Li et al. (2001). The figure was produced using MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and rendered with RASTER3D (Merritt and Bacon, 1997).

turns, can be regarded as two flanking b-ribbons within the six-stranded b-sheet, which penetrate the DNA grooves. We name this motif the `double wing' to reflect this similarity to the winged-helix. An important difference between the two motifs is that MotCF binds cognate DNA as a monomer, rather than as a dimer, which is unusual for a small DNA-binding protein. The DNA-binding domains of most transcription factors bind their targets as dimers to increase both the affinity and specificity of the interaction (Pabo and Sauer, 1992). Functional consequences of the model The proposed MotCF-DNA complex, shown in Fig. 5D, is not only consistent with the structural and biochemical data, but also with the biological and functional data. Based on a variety of data (Colland et al., 1998; Severinova et al., 1998; Sharma et al., 1999), a model has been proposed for how MotA and AsiA work together with the host RNA polymerase to mediate transcription from T4 middle promoters (Sharma et al., 1999). The central idea is that AsiA binds to the 4.2 domain of s70 (Severinova et al., 1996), and induces a conformational change that prevents it from binding to its usual target, the ­35 region of the host promoters (Hochschild and Dove, 1998). MotA is able to bind the s70­AsiA complex through its N-terminal domain, and the C-terminal domain provides the specificity for the ­30 region of the T4 middle promoter. An important feature of this MotA-AsiA© 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 43, 1079­1088

polymerase model is the preserved host-like interaction between the 2.4 domain of s70 (Severinova et al., 1996) and the ­10 region of the promoter (Hochschild and Dove, 1998). This suggests that the complex between AsiA and the 4.2 domain remains in the vicinity of the ­35 region, and that the small N-terminal domain of MotA (MotNF) would have to be adjacent to make contact. In the full MotA-DNA complex, it is reasonable to assume that MotNF would be adjacent to the N-terminus of MotCF. Combining our MotCF-DNA model with the biochemical data that define the orientation of MotCF with respect to the mot box (Sharma et al., 1999), MotNF would be located 5¢ or upstream of the mot box. As demonstrated in the model shown in Fig. 6, this is the correct location of MotNF with respect to the ­35 region. We have also determined the surface of MotNF that mediates the interaction with the AsiA/s70 complex (Finnin et al., 1997), and the residues within this surface can be appropriately positioned in the model (Fig. 6). It has also been shown that MotA can bind DNA in a multimeric fashion following the initial binding of a single molecule to the mot box (Schmidt and Kreuzer, 1992; March-Amegadzie and Hinton, 1995), but it is unclear whether these multimers have any physiological relevance (Cicero et al., 1998). A subset of middle-promoters, with their mot boxes, act as replication origins (Kreuzer and Morrical, 1994), and it is possible that multiple adjacent copies of MotA on the DNA have a role in forming the replication origin at these sites. However, the more

1086 N. Li et al. probable explanation is that the transcripts produced at middle promoters simply act as primers for replication (Belanger and Kreuzer, 1998; Nossal et al., 2001). The model shown in Figs 5D and 6, together with the way in which MotCF is packed within the crystal (Fig. 2), provides a possible explanation for the multimerization phenomenon. The crystal-packing arrangement described earlier appears to stabilize the exposed edges of the MotCF b-sheet, and similar interactions may be possible on DNA after the initial tight binding event at the mot box. It has been shown that multimers can form on either side of the cognate complex (Cicero et al., 1998), and this is consistent with the model shown in Fig. 5D. In our model of the MotCF-DNA complex, the b-strands are oriented approximately 45 with respect to the DNA axis, and the b-sheets of additional MotCF monomers may be able to associate non-specifically on either side. The type of association we envisage is similar to that present in the MotCF crystal and shown in Fig. 2, but it would require a significant distortion of the DNA. This needs to be verified by a structural analysis of the complex which is now in progress. Experimental procedures Expression and purification

Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.6, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF), and the supernatant was passed through a 50 ml SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The bound MotCF eluted at about 0.35 M NaCl during a 0­1.0 M NaCl gradient, and the fractions containing MotCF were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon cell with a 3 kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore). To remove minor contaminants, the sample was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol and 0.02 mM EDTA. paratone-N. The peak, inflection point and high energy remote wavelengths were directly determined from the mounted crystal, and 2 ¥ 180of data (1 and 10 s exposure times) were collected at each wavelength. Integration, scaling and merging of data were performed with the programme HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1996).

Structure determination and refinement
All crystallographic procedures including Patterson searches, MAD phasing, map calculations, density modification and simulated annealing and positional/B-factor refinement were carried out using the CNS programme suite (Brünger et al., 1998). The positions of 31 selenium atoms were identified in the P1 unit cell, using a combination of Patterson searches and difference Fouriers, and a MAD phasing calculation, using all three wavelengths, generated an experimental electron density map that was partially interpretable after density modification. An initial model of MotCF was built using the O program (Jones et al., 1991), and this was refined against the highest quality MAD dataset (peak). Following multiple rounds of model building, refinement and phase combination, a complete model with over 650 water molecules was built and refined at 1.6 Å without NCS restraints.

Co-ordinates
The co-ordinates of MotCF have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1KAF).

Crystallization and data collection
Crystallization trials were performed using the vapour diffusion hanging-drop technique, at 4C. Initial trials were performed with the Crystal Screen and Crystal Screen 2 kits (Hampton Research), and these produced small crystals that were subsequently optimized. Each crystallization drop comprised an equal volume of well solution and 10 mg ml­1 of MotCF in 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol and 0.02 mM EDTA. Diffraction data were collected at the Structural Biology Center (SBC) beamline 19ID at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data were collected from a single flash-frozen SeMet crystal cryo-protected in a 1:1 volume ratio of mineral oil and
