Abstract -- The dissociation and unfolding behavior of the GCN4 leucine zipper has been studied using SDS titration. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that the -helix content of the leucine zipper (20 µM) decreased during the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) titration. However, the -helix content of the leucine zipper still remained significant in the presence of 1 mM SDS, with little change detected when the SDS concentration further increased to 2 mM. The dimer dissociation of the leucine zipper is also a co-operative process during SDS titration; with no dimer remaining when SDS concentration reached 1 mM, as shown by electrophoresis and the the 222/208 ratio. Our results indicate that SDS efficiently induces leucine zipper dimer dissociation with the monomers still partially folded. The experimental results provide important evidence for the previous model that partial helix formation precedes dimerization in coiled coil folding. © 2001 Société française de biochimie et biologie moléculaire / Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

1. Introduction Leucine zippers are a special class of heptad repeats which contain leucine or iso-leucine at every seventh amino acid residue [1, 2]. They commonly contain the 4-3 heptad repeat of hydrophobic and non-polar residues that pack together in a parallel -helical coiled coil, as clearly illustrated by the X-ray crystal structure [3] of the leucine zipper from the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4. Despite the structural simplicity, leucine zippers have both intra-chain interactions and inter-chain interactions. Therefore, it is an ideal model for studying not only the equilibrium but also the kinetic aspects of the basic protein folding reaction: the association of two -helical monomers [4­8]. To interpret the experimental results which have shown that the folding of the leucine zipper coiled coil is a two-state process with no detectable intermediates, it has been suggested that the transition state contains little if any secondary structure [9]. Some protein folding models suggest that the stability of isolated secondary structure is important to the folding kinetics [10­13]. However, experiments have yet to show whether the monomer helix or dimerization occurs first during coiled coil folding. Using diffusion-collision theory, Myers and Oas suggested that intrinsic helix stability was a

major determinant of the folding rate of the GCN4 coiled coil [14]. Further study of the state of the leucine zipper monomer is critical to support the model. However, experimental measurements of the monomer structure are difficult because the native dimer forms at very low peptide concentrations. Therefore, trapping the unfolding or refolding equilibrium intermediate state, the partly folded monomer, will provide evidence for the model which has been widely used in protein folding research. SDS is an amphipathic anionic molecule employed widely in protein biochemistry for its powerful dissociation and solubilization properties [15, 16]. It has been shown to induce and stabilize secondary structure, particularly -helices [17­19]. Therefore, SDS is often used to probe the conformation of small protein fragments such as folding initiation sites [20­22]. In this study, we used SDS to titrate the GCN4 leucine zipper and found that, in the presence of SDS, leucine zipper dimers dissociated into monomers that still remained partially folded. The results provide evidence for the model proposed by Myers and Oas that partial helix formation precedes dimerization in coiled coil folding [14].

CD spectra were acquired on a Jasco 500C spectropolarimeter. Samples were prepared in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and the peptide concentration was determined by tyrosine absorbance in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride using an extinction coefficient of 1455 M cm­1 at 275 nm [24]. Native gel electrophoresis was carried out for 1 h in gels consisting of 4% polyacrylamide for the stacking gel and 12% for the separating gel at a constant voltage of 160 V using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean cell. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. All the experiments were carried out at 20 °C. 3. Results 3.1.

minimum at about 1 mM SDS. Little change in the CD spectra was detected even when the SDS concentration reached 2 mM. Compared with the CD spectrum of GCN4, leucine zipper completely unfolded in 4 M guanidinium hydrochloride, GCN4 leucine zipper in the presence of 1 mM SDS showed a large amount of remaining secondary structure. The curve in figure 2 gives further information about the loss of -helix content of GCN4 leucine zipper during SDS titration. For SDS concentrations up to 1 mM, the amount of -helix decreased to a value that remained stable even as SDS concentration reached 2 mM. Furthermore, the 222/208 ratio was 0.91 ± 0.02. 3.2. Dissociation of GCN4 leucine zipper dimer in the presence of SDS SDS efficiently caused the GCN4 leucine zipper dimer to dissociate. As shown in figure 3, GCN4 leucine zipper treated with different concentrations of SDS had different electrophoresis behavior. The native GCN4 leucine zipper, the dimeric form, showed one band per lane after electrophoresis. Compared with its native state, the sample treated with relatively low concentration SDS (< 1 mM) showed two bands, one of which had the same migration rate as that of the native GCN4 leucine zipper, while the

Its CD spectrum was then measured at a final peptide concentration of 20 µM. The final SDS concentrations were 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.2 mM for curves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively.

Dissociation and unfolding of GCN4 leucine zipper

955 that for this condition the leucine zipper molecules were trapped in a partly folded state. The 222/208 ratio 0.91 is characteristic of single-stranded or non-interacting -helices [29]. The results of the electrophoresis tests further supported the conclusion that for this condition the leucine zipper existed in monomeric form. The data, taken together, indicate that in the presence of 1 mM SDS the leucine zipper is completely dissociated but the monomer still has a large amount of secondary structure. It is well known that SDS, as a widely used denaturant, has powerful dissociation properties [15, 16]. For leucine zipper (coiled coil), our results indicate that SDS caused dissociation, however, the monomer still had significant amount of secondary structure. Previous studies have shown that unlike other denaturants, SDS can induce and stabilize secondary structure, particularly -helices [17­19], and is often used for probing the formation of small protein fragments such as folding initiation sites [20­22]. Our study suggested that the loss of secondary structures caused by SDS were dimer-dependent, but the residual structure stabilized by SDS after dissociation during the unfolding process. These results are consistent with previous studies including structure prediction [9, 32] and peptide truncation studies [33, 34], which suggested that part of the leucine zipper amino acid sequence had high helix-forming propensity which may act as `trigger factors' mediating coiled coil folding. Therefore, in this study, the unfolding equilibrium intermediate state, a partly folded leucine zipper monomer, was trapped in the presence of about 1 mM SDS. This supports the folding model for coiled coil proposed by Myers and Oas [14] by providing important evidence of a leucine zipper monomer with relatively stable secondary structure.

other had the same migration rate as that of the sample treated with 1 mM SDS, which also showed only one band that migrated faster than that of the native GCN4 leucine zipper. Like the GCN4 leucine zipper treated by 1 mM SDS, the sample treated with SDS concentration higher than 1 mM showed one band per lane as the monomeric form (data not shown). 4. Discussion As -helix coiled coil, leucine zippers have simple secondary and tertiary structures. Moreover, the large number of naturally occurring leucine zipper proteins include a wide variety of distinct and overlapping dimerization specificities [25]. Therefore, the leucine zipper coiled coil motif has attracted continued attention not only in the analysis of protein designs but also studies of protein folding [14, 25­29]. Studies of coiled coil folding have not resolved which occurs first, the formation of the monomer helix or dimerization during coiled coil folding. Studies of the unfolding equilibrium states of leucine zipper (coiled coil) for different denaturing conditions have sought to answer this question. However, no typical transition state can be detected using common denaturants, such as guanidinium chloride [30] and temperature [31], to study the behavior of the coiled coil unfolding, because of the unclear denaturing mechanisms and the easy formation of the native dimer. Therefore, a condition must be found which can trap the unfolding coiled coil intermediates. In our experiments, SDS caused GCN4 leucine zipper to partly unfold during titration. At SDS concentrations of about 1 mM, unfolding reached a stable level, indicating
