Structure of rat transthyretin (rTTR) complex with Ê thyroxine at 2.5 A resolution: first non-biased insight into thyroxine binding reveals different hormone orientation in two binding sites
The ®rst observation of the unique environment for thyroxine (T4) binding in tetrameric rat transthyretin (rTTR) is reported as determined by X-ray diffraction. These data revealed different modes of hormone binding in the two unique hormone-binding sites in the rat TTR tetramer channel. Differences in the orientation of thyroxine and the position of water molecules in the two binding sites further suggest a mechanism for the docking pathway of the hormone into the channel of TTR. Crystals of the rat transthyretin±thyroxine complex are isomorphous with those reported for apo rTTR and crystallized in the tetragonal space group P43212 with four independent TTR monomeric subunits in the asymmetric part Ê of the crystal lattice. Data were collected to 2.5 A resolution and the structure was re®ned to R = 20.9% for 15 384 data in Ê the resolution range 12±2.5 A. Similar to human TTR, the rat protein is also a 54 000 Da tetramer with four identical polypeptide chains of 127 amino-acid residues. Of the 22 amino-acid residues which differ between the human and rat sequences, none are in the thyroxine-binding domains. Analysis of these structural data reveals that the tertiary structure is similar to that of hTTR, with only small differences in the ¯exible loop regions on the surface of the structure. Conformational changes of the amino acids in the channel result in a hydrogen-bonded network that connects the two binding domains, in contrast to the hydrogen bonds formed along the tetramer interface in the apo transthyretin structure. These changes suggest a mechanism for the signal transmission between thyroxine-binding domains.

1. Introduction
In man, transthyretin (hTTR, prealbumin) is one of three serum proteins which transports thyroid hormones through the general circulation and is responsible for binding about 20% of the plasma thyroxine (3,5,3H ,5H -tetraiodo-l-thyronine; T4) (Braverman & Utiger, 2000). In rat and other lower vertebrates, transthyretin is the primary serum thyroid hormone-transport protein and thus has a greater physiological role than it does in man (Robbins, 2000; Davis et al., 1970). Rat transthyretin (rTTR) has 85% sequence homology with the human protein and has 22 amino-acid changes in the 127 amino-acid residue monomers (Sundelin et al., 1987; Pettersson et al., 1989) (Figs. 1 and 2). Most of the sequence differences occur in peripheral loop regions, while the hormone-binding domain is strictly conserved. The hormonebinding constants Ka are similar to those for human TTR (Navab et al., 1977). Numerous TTR variants related to familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) are unstable and form

®brils that are deposited in different organ tissues. The binding of thyroxine or other ligands stabilizes the amyloidogenic TTR variants (Miroy et al., 1996; Klabunde et al., 2000). Knowledge of the thyroid hormone-binding process might be useful in the treatment of patients affected with FAP. Structural data for wild-type and most mutant complexes of human TTR have two independent monomeric -barrels (A and B) in the asymmetric unit of the orthorhombic P21212 crystal lattice (Klabunde et al., 2000; Blake et al., 1978; Blake & Oately, 1977; De La Paz et al., 1992; Cody et al., 1991; Ciszak et al., 1992; Wojtczak et al., 1992, 1993, 1996; Damas et al., 1996; Ghosh et al., 2000; Petrassi et al., 2000; Steinrauf et al., 1993; Hamilton et al., 1993; Terry et al., 1993; Schormann et al., 1998). The only exceptions are the monoclinic forms for the lowÄ resolution structure of apo Leu55Pro TTR (Sebastiao et al., 1996, 1998, 2000) and an apo hTTR (Wojtczak et al., 2001). The two independent monomers of the orthorhombic lattice are assembled around a central channel such that the tetramer has molecular 222 symmetry. The independent monomers A and B are related by a pseudo-twofold symmetry axis parallel to the crystallographic b axis. In most hTTR structures, the crystallographic twofold axis is coincident with the channel axis and results in twofold symmetry for each of the ligandbinding sites formed by pairs of monomers (A±AH and B±BH ) positioned across the channel axis (Fig. 3). Because of the lack of such molecular symmetry for thyroid hormone and its analogs, the interpretation of the ligand-binding interactions in hTTR has been hampered by the presence of twofoldaveraged electron density in the channel representing the two symmetry-related orientations of the bound ligand. Therefore, all reported human transthyretin ligand complexes show a 50% disorder in the occupation of the binding domain (Klabunde et al., 2000, Blake & Oately, 1977; De La Paz et al., 1992; Cody et al., 1991; Ciszak et al., 1992; Wojtczak et al., 1992, 1993, 1996; Damas et al., 1996; Ghosh et al., 2000; Petrassi et al., 2000). Similar to human TTR, the structure of chicken transthyretin (Sunde et al., 1996) also has two monomeric subunits in the asymmetric part of its hexagonal crystal lattice. Data for the structure of the Leu55Pro variant of hTTR indicated two types of substructures in the asymmetric unit ± a symmetrical dimer and an independent tetramer Ä (Sebastiao et al., 1996, 1998, 2000). In contrast, the reported structure of apo rat TTR (Wojtczak, 1997) is the only structure of transthyretin that has a complete functional tetramer (monomeric subunits A±D) in the asymmetric unit of the lattice. The A and B monomers of rTTR are equivalent to the Figure 1 hTTR A and B subunits, while the C and D subunits correThe rat transthyretin monomer with sequence differences between rat spond to the AH and BH monomers of the human TTR strucand human TTR marked in magenta. -sheets A±H are labeled.

Thus, the binding domains of the hTTR structures are characterized by identical geometry and intermolecular interactions. On the other hand, the rTTR tetramer channel had no crystallographic twofold symmetry that would impose such constraints on the ligand binding. Therefore, it was expected that the structure of rTTR± ligand complexes would reveal much greater details of the hormone binding in the transthyretin channel. The aim of this research was to study the details of thyroxine interactions in rat transthyretin, the role of the 22 sequence differences between human and rat TTR in the thyroxine binding and the contribution of the unique tetrameric environFigure 2 ment to af®nity differences in two Sequence comparison between human (h) and rat (r).

2. Experimental
Pooled rat sera were obtained from Pel-Frez (Rogers, AZ, USA) and puri®ed using a modi®ed human transthyretin protocol (Tritish, 1972). The complex crystal suitable for data collection was obtained by cocrystallization of rat TTR and thyroxine from 55±65% ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 5.0 using the hanging-drop technique with HANGMAN (Luft et al., 1992; Luft & DeTitta, 1992). 5 ml protein solution was placed over the reservoir of 60% ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 5.0. Area-detector data were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS II imaging-plate system with a Rigaku 200 rotating-anode source from a 0.2 Â 0.2 Â 0.6 mm crystal at room temperature (293 K). The crystals were tetragonal, space group P43212, with a complete tetramer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal lattice, which Ê had unit-cell parameters a = 82.53, c = 161.84 A. This lattice differs by less than 0.03% from that reported for the apo rTTR structure (Wojtczak, 1997). Of the 83 761 re¯ections collected, Ê 18 890 were independent (93.8% completeness to 2.5 A), with an Rsym of 10.6%. The highest resolution shell was 82% complete. The average I/' ratio was 6.0 for all data. The complex is isostructural with the apo rTTR structure whose coordinates were used for initial phasing of the electron-density maps. The orientation of thyroxine was determined from the `complex À native' difference maps calculated with PHASES (Furey & Swaminathan, 1996). The model was initially re®ned with PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980; Finzel, 1987; Smith, personal communication) È and X-PLOR 3.851 (Brunger, 1992) using re¯ections of Ê resolution higher than 8.0 A. The model was veri®ed by a series of omit electron-density maps using CHAIN (Sack, 1988) and O (Jones et al., 1991; Jones & Kjeldgaard, 1997).

Final re®nement was carried out using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) with the maximum-likelihood target, ' A-weighted maps and bulk-solvent correction and resulted in R = 20.98% Ê for 15 384 data in the resolution range 12.0±2.5 A and Rfree = 27.5% for 1147 re¯ections (7% of data). Since there was no interpretable density for residues 1±7, the structure consists of residues 8±127 for each monomer (A±D), two thyroxine ligands bound in different orientations in the unique binding sites AC and BD and 172 water molecules. The ®nal structure also accounts for the disordered positions of the side chains of Met213 and Arg621. Conformational statistics show that 85.6 and 14.4% of the residues are positioned in the most favorable and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively, as calculated with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). The superposition of the four monomers of rTTR on hTTR reveals little conformational difference in their -sheet structures (Fig. 4). The datacollection and ®nal re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 1 and the coordinates of rTTR have been deposited with the PDB.

3. Results and discussion
The four independent monomeric subunits (A±D) of rat TTR constitute the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure. The small differences observed in the geometry of the four rTTR subunits re¯ect differences in their intermolecular interactions owing to crystal packing. The major differences in main-chain conformation between subunits are found in the ¯exible regions for residues 34±41 and 98±104, which are fragments that are disordered in the reported crystal structures of human and rat transthyretin. The 98±104 fragment and the N- and C-termini of each monomeric subunit contain numerous charged amino acids (Arg, His) and Gly residues in their sequence (Fig. 2) and may contribute to their observed disorder and thus might be related to the opening and closing of the channel entrance or the recognition and transport of T4 zwitterion towards the binding site. However, as yet no structural data support this hypothesis.
3.1. Halogen-binding pocket occupation

There are three pairs of halogen-binding pockets (P1±P1H , P2±P2H , P3±P3H ) in each hormone-binding site of the TTR tetramer (Fig. 5). The innermost P3 pocket is formed by aliphatic side chains of Ala108, Leu110, Thr119 and Ser117. One surface of the P3 pocket is formed by the main-chain carbonyl and NH groups of Ala108, Ala109, Leu110, Ser117, Thr118 and Thr119. Therefore, this pocket has mixed hydrophobic and polar characteristics, with signi®cant contributions from nucleophilic groups in the polypeptide chains. The middle P2 pocket formed by the side chains of Leu110, Ala109, Lys15 and Leu17 has a hydrophobic character. The carbonyl groups of Ala109, Lys15 and Ala108 form one hydrophilic surface of this pocket. The outer P1 pocket is shaped by the side chains of Thr106, Met13 and Lys15; while being positioned between the strands A and E, it is separated

from the P2 pocket by the side chains of Leu17 and Lys15. The deep cavity between Glu54, Lys15 and Met13 positioned next to the P1 pocket is not ®lled by any of the ligands in the TTR complexes studied to date. Signi®cant contribution to the ligand binding can come from the charged surface region formed by the side chains of Glu54 and Lys15. The `complex À native' electron-density maps, calculated with PHASES (Furey & Swaminathan, 1996) and contoured at 5' above background, revealed four density peaks in the P1 and P1H outer pockets, the proximal P2 pocket of monomer A and the distal P3H pocket of monomer C, and correspond to the T4 iodine-substituent positions in the AC binding site formed by monomers A and C. Such an orientation is similar to that reported for human TTR±T4 complex (Wojtczak et al., 1996). The additional density peak observed at the 4' level could not be interpreted as a phenolic iodine of T4 in an alternative orientation and thus it was assigned as a water molecule bound in the P3 pocket. The observed density distribution indicates that thyroxine is bound in the AC site in a single orientation (re®ned occupancy 0.40) and does not have the twofold disorder found in the human TTR complex (Wojtczak et al., 1996). The omit map (Fig. 6) shows the hormone molecule is bound in the overall transoid conformation and in a skewed À84.3/À8.6 conformation of the ether bridge, similar to the conformation of the thyroxine molecule (Cody, 1980, 1981). The 11 and 12 torsion angles describing the conformation of the tyrosyl moiety of the hormone are 60.9 and 89.0 , respectively. In this orientation the phenolic hydroxyl group of T4 hydrogen bonds to the water molecule in P3 pocket of Ê monomer A (2.75 A), which also forms a contact to iodine I3H Ê ). The second water molecule found in this pocket (3.41 A hydrogen bonds to the ®rst water and to the Ser117 side chain Ê (2.66 and 2.92 A, respectively). Owing to this interaction, the Ser117 side chain has a different conformation to that found in Ê the apo rTTR (Wojtczak, 1997) and forms a 2.71 A hydrogen

bond to Ser317 of the second binding site. The carboxylic group of T4 is positioned close to monomer C and forms a Ê 3.61 A interaction with the Lys415 amino group. The hormone Ê amino group participates in a 4.3 A contact with the Glu454 Ê carboxylic group. The short contact of 3.07 A found between H I3 and the Ala109 carbonyl group is consistent with the CSD search for IÁ Á ÁO interactions (Cody & Murray-Rust, 1984). In the BD binding site the major electron-density peaks are found in the P3/P3H and P1/P1H pockets, corresponding to the hormone phenolic I3H and I5H and tyrosyl I3 and I5 substituents, respectively. The ®fth density peak in the P2 pocket indicates the position of the water molecule bound between I5H , the Ala309 carbonyl group and the Leu217 backbone N atom. The omit map (Fig. 7) reveals that thyroxine (re®ned occupancy 0.36) is bound in a twisted conformation (Cody, 1980, 1981) with 9 and 9H torsion angles of 100.4 and À42.7 , respectively. The 11 and 12 torsion angles of the tyrosyl moiety are 178.7 and 73.0 , respectively. The twisted conformation of T4 permits it to penetrate the binding site deeper than observed for the skewed conformation in the AC site. Both the phenolic iodine substituents in the P3/P3H pockets do not form close contacts with the nucleophilic carbonyl groups of the main chain. The shortest IÁ Á ÁO distance to Ala308 and Ala708 Ê is about 3.5 A owing to the central position of the phenolic ring in the channel. Also, the phenolic hydroxyl group does not form direct interactions with the surrounding Ser317 and Ser717 residues. Instead, both serine residues are involved in polar interactions to Ser117 and Ser517 across the tetramer Ê interface (2.88 and 4.16 A, respectively). The single water molecule found near Thr319 hydrogen bonds only to thyÊ roxine OH (2.55 A). The carboxylic group of T4 interacts with Ê ) and a water molecule (2.77 A). The hormone Ê Lys615 (3.37 A amino group interacts with the Glu254 carboxyl group of Ê monomer B (3.41 A). Comparison of the AC and BD binding sites in the rTTR±T4 structure (Fig. 8) reveals that the mainchain conformation is similar in both sites. In the AC site the phenolic iodine substituents are positioned in the P2 and P3H pockets of monomers A and C, respectively. The pair of water molecules found in the P3 pocket of monomer A form hydrogen bonds between the phenolic OH group of T4 and the Ser117 side chain. There are no similar hydrogen bonds in the BD site owing to the P3/P3H binding of the ligand iodines. The two water molecules are found in P2 pockets (monomers B and D) and interact with the polar groups of Ala308 and Ala708. Therefore, the Ser317 side chain has a different conformation to Ser117. The deep binding of T4 in the BD site also alters the conformation of Leu310 when compared with its Leu110 equivalent in Figure 6 monomer A. Also, the conformations of Thr119 and Stereoview of omit electron-density map (1') for the AC site of the rTTR±T4 H Thr519 in site AC differ from the conformations of complex, showing T4 bound in the P2/P3 orientation and the water molecules (x) in Thr319 and Thr719 in site BD. The Thr319, in the the P3 pocket. Ê conformation altered by T4, forms a 3.36 A hydrogen bond to Ser115 across the tetramer interface. In the structures of T4 complexes with wt hTTR (Wojtczak et al., 1996) and its variants Val30Met (Hamilton et al., 1993) and Ala109Thr (Steinrauf et al., 1993), T4 occupies a similar position and is bound in the P3/P2H orientation in both binding sites. This mode of binding is similar to that found in the AC site of the rTTR±T4 complex. However, in these complexes there is no equivalence of the P3/P3H mode of T4 binding found in the BD site of this complex. The position of water in the P3 pocket of the rTTR AC site is close to that of the phenolic iodine of the ligand in P3/P2H orientation in hTTR, but is shifted slightly towards the tetramer center. The water molecules found in the P2 pockets of the Figure 7 BD site also are positioned closer to the channel Stereoview of omit electron-density map (1') for the BD site of the rTTR±T4 H entrance that the position determined in hTTR for complex, showing the P3/P3 orientation of T4 and the water molecule (x) in the P2 the iodine substituent of the P3H /P2 oriented ligand. pocket.

the hTTR±T4 complex (Wojtczak et al., 1996) and the rTTR±T4 complex shows few signi®cant differences in the AC site and fewer differences in the BD site. Therefore, we conclude that the major conformational changes result from differences in the orientation of thyroxine. The twofold disorder observed in the orthorhombic human TTR complexes does not allow recognition of the new P3/P3H binding mode of T4. The only indication of such binding was the cross-phased density map calculated as described in Wojtczak et al. (1996).
3.2. Thyroxine binding based on the comparison of human and rat TTR complexes

In all the hTTR complexes reported to date, the ligands have been bound in a binding site composed of a pair of two twofold-related TTR monomers. Therefore, in the structures of human TTR complexes, the twofold averaging of the electron density, as required by the crystallographic symmetry axis along the channel, resulted in the convoluted features of Since the averaged occupancy of P3/P2H and P3/P3H oriented the density maps. The hTTR±T4 complex obtained by soaking ligands would give the same electron-density distribution with of thyroxine into the TTR crystals (Blake & Oately, 1977) similar solvent structure, the detection of the possible P3/P3H revealed a water molecule positioned in the inner P3 pocket, orientation of T4 in hTTR complexes was not possible. while the phenolic iodines of the hormone molecule occupied Comparison of the AC site with the apo rTTR structure the other inner P3H and P2 pocket. The structure determina(Wojtczak, 1997) shows no signi®cant differences in the sidetion of cocrystallized hTTR±T4 complex (Wojtczak et al., chain conformations (Table 2). In contrast, the presence of T4 1996) revealed that thyroxine binds deeper than in the crystal bound deep in both P3 and P3H pockets of the BD domain soaked with hormone; also, no additional peak corresponding results in conformational changes of Leu310, Ser317, Thr319, to water molecule was present. However, it was impossible to Leu617 and Thr719 surrounding thyroxine. Also, Lys215 and distinguish between the possible P3/P3H and P2/P3H binding Lys615 have different conformations and interact with the modes of the hormone. The rat TTR structure reported here alanyl moiety of T4 via several water molecules. In the apo has provided the ®rst opportunity to overcome the statistical rTTR structure all the side chains mentioned above are disorder of the ligand position in TTR and to analyze the positioned towards the channel center. Comparison between details of T4 binding. In one binding domain, the hormone is bound with the phenolic I atoms bound in the P2/P3H pocket and with the water molecule positioned deep in the P3 pocket, similar to the structure reported for a hTTR±T4 complex (Blake & Oately, 1977). In the second binding domain, the phenolic iodines occupy the P3/P3H pockets and the water molecule was found in the P2 middle pocket, similar to that observed for the cocrystallized complex (Wojtczak et al., 1996). In all these structures the polar interactions of the hormone alanyl moiety with Lys15 and Glu54 were maintained. The comparison of both human TTR± T4 complexes with the rat complex reported here suggests a mechanism for thyroxine docking to TTR. In the ®rst step, the electrostatic recognition of the T4 alanyl moiety by Lys15 and Glu54 positions the hormone at the channel Figure 8 entrance.

pockets. On the way towards the center of TTR tetramer, the ligand removes the solvent molecules bound in partially hydrophilic P2 and P3 pockets. The ®rst stage was detected in the soaked hTTR±T4 complex as reported by Blake & Oately (1977) and is similar to that found in the AC binding site of this structure. In the second stage, the hormone molecule removes the P3 bound water, positioning its phenolic iodine substituents in P3 and P3H pockets on the opposite sides of the binding site. The removed water is pushed to the empty P2 pocket. This orientation of the ligand was found in the BD site of the reported structure. Finally, the water molecule escapes from the hydrophobic environment of the P2 pocket ¯anked by the ring system of the hormone. The ligand phenolic iodines are positioned in the P3 or P2 pockets, as indicated by the electron density in the co-crystallized hTTR±T4 complex structure (Wojtczak et al., 1996). much shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii; this is consistent with the structural results retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD; Cody & Murray-Rust, 1984). The energy of short nucleophile±iodine interactions is similar to that of the weak hydrogen bonds (Kollman et al., 1982). The alternative interactions enable the positioning of the I atoms in either P3/P2H or P3/P3H orientation. The interactions of tyrosyl iodines in the hydrophobic P1 pockets result from the ligand anchoring between P3 and P2 pockets and the charged amino acids at the channel entrance and seem to be only of secondary importance for the ligand binding. If the ligand possesses a greater conformational ¯exibility, not restricted by two tyrosyl ring substituents, it can adopt different ether-bridge conformations and occupy distal and proximal pockets on the different monomers constituting the binding site, as found in the TTR±3,3H -T2 complex (Wojtczak et al., 1992). To accomplish this, the ligand is bound across the channel and its skewed conformation is slightly altered. In both cases the iodine substituents may be a target for nucleophile binding. Ligands in which the ether-bridge conformation is not restricted, such as DNNAT or milrinone, can penetrate the binding site deeper and their substituents are bound in the innermost P3 pockets. In the DNNAT±TTR complex (Wojtczak et al., 1996), the additional factor is the nucleophilic character of the nitro groups. These groups tend to bind to a hydrogen-bond donor, such as Ser117 OG hydroxyl or the polypeptide chain NÐH groups. This tendency favors the P3 pocket binding, since only that pocket has the proton-donor groups exposed. Such a preference should also be observed for chloro and, to certain extent, bromo analogs of thyroxine. The hydrophobic core of the hormones is bound along the aliphatic channel surface, interacting with the side chains separating the halogen-binding pockets. These interactions could be a signi®cant binding contribution in the case of ligands lacking the substitution on their tyrosyl rings, such as DNNAT. In its complex, the ligand tyrosyl moiety is bound along the groove between -strands E and A and is signi®cantly shifted from the channel axis. The opposite effect seems to be observed for the TTR±T4 complex. The rigidity of the molecule and four bulky iodine substituents prevent it from being positioned off the channel axis. The intermediate orientation is observed for 3,3H -T2, which binds P2H and P3 pockets across the channel and participates in hydrophobic core interactions with the surrounding aliphatic side chains (Wojtczak et al., 1992). We can hypothesize that by replacing speci®c I atoms by aliphatic substituents one could decrease the molecule rigidity and change the pocket preferences, which could result in the ligand binding along the channel axis with P1 hydrophobic interactions dominating the binding process. The effect can be quanti®ed by comparing the relative ligand orientation in the TTR channel. The axis of the T4 molecule, de®ned across the ligand-ring system as a line between the phenolic ring C4H and tyrosyl C1 atoms, is almost parallel to the channel axis. In the 3,3H -T2 complex the angle between these axes is about 10 , while for DNNAT it is approximately 20 .

3.3. Specificity of the TTR ligand-binding pockets

The TTR hormone-binding sites consist of four unique regions: the distal P3 pocket with substantial contribution from nucleophilic hydroxyl and carbonyl groups and aliphatic side chains, the proximal P2 pocket formed by aliphatic side chains and the nucleophilic carbonyl and polypeptide NÐH groups exposed, the outer P1 pockets that are exclusively aliphatic and the charged surface region formed by Lys15 and Glu54. The P1 to P3 pockets are located in the grooves between adjacent -strands and are separated by the amino-acid side chains and the charged path is on the channel surface close to the channel entrance. All of these regions are involved in ligand-binding interactions. Comparative analysis of the TTR complex structures enables one to form conclusions about their contribution to the overall binding energy. We have determined the crystal structure of hTTR complexes with thyroxine and its analogs 3,3H -diiodol-thyronine (3,3H -T2) and 3H ,5H -dinitro-N-acetyl-l-thyronine (DNNAT), as well as milrinone (Wojtczak et al., 1992, 1993, 1996) and a ¯avonoid ligand (Ciszak et al., 1992). The topology of the binding site is such that the iodines of the conformationally constrained T4 can occupy both P3 and P3H pockets simultaneously only when T4 has a twist diphenylether conformation, as found in the BD site of the rTTR±T4 structure. Otherwise, the ligand iodine substituents occupy the distal P3, the proximal P2H pocket and the two outer P1/P1H pockets, as found in the AC site of this rTTR±T4 complex or in the hTTR±T4 complexes. In both orientations the alanyl moiety of T4 is involved in polar interactions with the charged Lys15 and Glu54 close to the channel entrance. Also, the 3,3H -T2 I atoms occupy the P2 and P3 pockets and have a skewed conformation similar to T4, which places the thyronine nucleus across the TTR channel. As was found in both T4 and 3,3H -T2 complexes, the iodine substituents bound in the inner P2 and P3 pockets form contacts to nucleophiles such as carbonyl or peptide NÐH groups, with the distances being as Ê short as 2.80 A. The IÁ Á ÁO or IÁ Á ÁN distances are found to be

However, there been found in the pockets P3H and P2 of both the T4-binding are several changes in the side-chain conformation of the sites.

The four of Lys15 and its equivalent residues (Lys215, Lys415 and water molecules conserved between the native rTTR and its Lys615) was observed on binding T4. The distance between T4 complex structure have been found at the center of the Lys15 CD atoms across the binding sites AC and BD are 8.46 Ê Ê TTR tetramer, between the four monomer subunits. In the and 9.45 A, and 7.69 and 8.40 A for the unliganded and unliganded TTR these water molecules form a network of T4-bound rat transthyretin, respectively. The observed differhydrogen bonds along the tetramer interface, involving ences in the chain conformation and the water positions lead Ser117, Ser115 and Ser717 of monomers A and D as well as to the proposed model of the T4-binding mechanism with signal transmission between the binding sites. The numbering of the residues used below to describe the observed changes are kept consistent with the hTTR±T4 complex structure. Upon entering the open channel in which the Lys215 and Lys615 chains are Ê positioned approximately 9 A apart from each other, thyroxine binds deep in the channel with its phenolic iodines positioned in both P3 and P3H pockets, which causes reorientation of the Leu310 and Thr319 side chains. The Lys15 side chains move Ê closer by about 1 A, with their methylene groups forming hydrophobic interactions with the tyrosyl moiety of the hormone. The bulky phenolic iodines then cause the reorientation of the Ser317 and Ser717 side Figure 9 chains, thereby disrupting any hydrogen The hydrogen-bond network at the tetramer interface in the rTTR±T4 complex.

The reorientation of Ser and Thr hydroxyl groups results in the formation of a new hydrogen-bond network directly between Ser317 and Ser117, Thr319 and Ser115, as well as from Thr519 to Ser715 across the interface. The new network of hydrogen bonds between two binding sites replaces the previously existing network of interactions along the interface separating these sites, changes the local polarity and creates the new network of side chains and water interactions (Figs. 9 and 10). The conserved water molecules at the tetramer interface also participate in the new hydrogen-bonding network. The changes in the monomer A and C Ser side-chain conformations cause a Figure 10 shift of well de®ned water molecules in the The hydrogen-bond network at the tetramer interface in apo rTTR (Wojtczak, 1997).

main-chain carbonyl groups of Ser117 and Thr119. The conformational changes resulting from the ligand binding are transmitted to the second site, also disrupting the hydrogen bonds to the water molecules in the inner pockets. This allows the second T4 molecule to bind in the empty P3H and P2 pockets of the second binding site of the transthyretin tetramer. The hormone molecule bound in the second site reconstitutes a hydrogen-bond network and forms a partly polar cavity in the P2 pocket that might contain a water molecule, as observed in the rTTR±T4 structure. The proposed mechanism, based on the observed conformational changes, might explain the negative cooperativity of T4 binding to transthyretin. The presence of two bulky iodine substituents bound in both P2 and P3H simultaneously seems to be crucial for the Ser and Thr conformational changes and results in the disruption of the existing network of hydrogen bonds with the solvent inside the binding site and the formation of an alternative network of interactions between the altered side chains of both binding sites and the solvent in the second site. The ligand binding to the phenolic I atoms in both the inner P2 and P3H pockets seems to be more favorable than the P3/P3H mode of binding, since the iodine interacts with the protein. The binding of water in the P3 pockets is weaker than that found for the P2/P3H orientation. Also, the latter interactions are mediated by the water molecules easily penetrating the binding sites. For the 3H ,5H -dinitro-N-acetylthyronine analog (Wojtczak et al., 1996), the Ser117 hydroxyl groups are oriented towards the interior of the binding site and form hydrogen bonds to both nitro groups, which are not able to participate in signal transmission between the sites. The above conclusions are based only on the structural data, since there are no reports on the binding af®nities to the ®rst and second ligand molecule to TTR tetramers other than those of thyroxine (Cheng et al., 1977). The small adjustments of the main-chain conformations are caused by the new network of hydrogen bonds formed upon the T4 binding. These changes result in slightly altered positions of the side chains of Pro113, Tyr114 and Pro86. These changes, including reorientation of the Thr118, Ser115 and Ser112 hydroxyl groups, result in the altered environment of the Trp79 ring system. The observed changes are consistent with the results of ¯uorescence studies on the conformational changes in TTR upon thyroxine binding (Gonzalez & Tapia, 1992). mediates the T4-binding interactions. The different binding of T4 is possible owing to the conformational changes of the Ê hormone ether bridge and owing to the formation of a 3.07 A IÁ Á ÁO interaction to the main-chain carbonyl groups. The different modes of ligand binding also result in different conformations of the side chains forming the channel surface. Also, the difference in the hydrogen-bond network is observed between the complex and the apo rTTR. In the apo rTTR the hydrogen bonds at the tetramer center are formed mainly along the interface between the two binding sites. In the rTTR±T4 complex, the hydrogen bonds are formed along the channel axis, thereby transmitting the signal from one site to the other. Such changes might be a part of the mechanism of negative cooperativity, which is used to explain the differences in the binding af®nity of two hormone-binding sites in transthyretin. Also, comparison of the soaked hTTR±T4 complex structure (Blake & Oately, 1977) with the cocrystallized hTTR±T4 structure (Wojtczak et al., 1996) and the complex reported here suggests a binding pathway for T4 in transthyretin. The initial position is P2/P3H as observed in the AC site of the investigated complex, as this orientation is the major one in the rTTR. The small conformational changes of the central TTR channel in both sites results in the hormone binding in the P3/P3H orientation in the secondary site (BD in the reported structure). The water molecules bound in the partially polar pockets of the channel are removed by the ligand penetrating the binding site. Despite differences in the orientation of the ligand, its interactions formed by Lys15 at the channel entrance are preserved, suggesting that they are a component of the ligand-recognition mechanism in transthyretin.

4. Conclusions
We report the ®rst structural details of thyroxine binding in a unique tetrameric TTR environment. The structure of the rTTR±T4 complex has revealed two different thyroxinebinding modes. In one mode, thyroxine is positioned in the channel with the phenolic iodines bound in the P2 and P3H pockets of site AC with binding interactions mediated by the water molecules positioned in the P3 pocket not containing the T4 iodine. The second binding site (B/D) binds the ligand with the phenolic iodines positioned in both P3 and P3H inner pockets. The water molecule found in the middle P2 pocket
