The crystal structures of the catalytic domain of human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPheOH) in complex with the physiological cofactor 6(R)-L -erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and the substrate analogues 3-(2-thienyl)-L -alanine (THA) or L -norleucine (NLE) have been ° determined at 2.0 A resolution. The ternary THA complex confirms a ° previous 2.5 A structure, and the ternary NLE complex shows that similar large conformational changes occur on binding of NLE as those observed for THA. Both structures demonstrate that substrate binding triggers structural changes throughout the entire protomer, including the displacement of Tyr138 from a surface position to a buried position at the active ° site, with a maximum displacement of 20.7 A for its hydroxyl group. Two hinge-bending regions, centred at Leu197 and Asn223, act in consort upon substrate binding to create further large structural changes for parts of the C terminus. Thus, THA/L -Phe binding to the active site is likely to represent the epicentre of the global conformational changes observed in the full-length tetrameric enzyme. The carboxyl and amino groups of THA and NLE are positioned identically in the two structures, supporting the conclusion that these groups are of key importance in substrate binding, thus explaining the broad non-physiological substrate specificity observed for artificially activated forms of the enzyme. However, the specific activity with NLE as the substrate was only about 5% of that with THA, which is explained by the different affinities of binding and different catalytic turnover.

catalytic activity of the enzyme is tightly regulated in vitro and in vivo by the binding of L -Phe and BH4 as well as by phosphorylation. The tetrameric form binds L -Phe with positive cooperativity, BH4 acts as a negative effector of the substrate-triggered conformational changes and catalytic activation, whereas, phosphorylation of Ser16 sensitises the enzyme for substrate activation.6 Recent 3-D structure analyses of the double truncated dimeric form (DN1-102/DC428-452)-hPheOH) have revealed that significant conformational changes occur in the catalytic domain of the enzyme on substrate binding,7 and these changes are most likely linked to the global conformational transition and catalytic activation that occur in the full-length tetrameric form.8 ­ 10 Artificially activated forms of PheOH are known to hydroxylate a wide variety of natural and unnatural amino acid residues, including 3-(2-thienyl)-L -alanine (THA) and L -norleucine (NLE).11 Some of the analogues are, however, poor substrates and some also result in a partial uncoupling of the hydroxylation/oxidation reaction.5 L -Phe and THA are competitive substrates9,12 that induce the same global conformational transition of the full-length tetrameric enzyme upon binding at the active site.10,13 The present study has confirmed at a higher resolution ° ° (2.0 A) the main features of the 2.5 A crystal structure of the ternary (DN1-102/DC428-452)hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA complex,7 and demonstrated that the same conformational changes occur in the catalytic domain structure on binding of NLE as on binding of THA. On the basis of the 3-D structures of the binary and ternary complexes and a computer algorithm for molecular motions14,15 two hinge-bending regions were identified in the substrate-triggered molecular motion of PheOH. Moreover, a structural explanation for the relatively broad non-physiological substrate specificity observed for artificially activated forms of the enzyme has been obtained.

425 ­427 (426 ­ 427 in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure) were not included in the refined models. The electron density for the remaining backbone was readily interpretable and, with the exception of Ala144 N, Pro147 O, Phe149 N and Phe149 O (in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure) and Leu142 Ca, Asp143 N, Asp143 O and Ala144 N (in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structure), all atoms have sA-weighted 2Fo 2 Fc electron density above 1.0s. By contrast, residues 142­ 149 have well defined electron density in the ligand-free hPheOHFe(II) and binary hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4 complexes.16 The loop containing Tyr138 (residues 134 ­ 139), including all its side-chains, is well defined ° and has low B-factors (, 35 A2) in both ternary structures. The loop is surrounded by two short 3/10-helices (residues 125 ­133 and 140­ 142) in the ligand-free and binary enzymes,16 although only one of these 3/10-helices (residues 126­ 130) is predicted20 in the ternary structures. The substrate analogues (Figure 1) and BH4 (Figure 2) have clear electron density in both structures, consistent with defined positions for all their atoms. Ramachandran plots21 calculated by PROCHECK22 give 91.8% and 90.7% of the residues in the most favoured regions, and 8.2% and 9.3% in additional allowed regions for the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA and hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structures, respectively. No residues are in generously allowed or disallowed regions. r.m.s. deviations of bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles and improper angles (Table 1) as well as Luzatti and sA coordinate errors were calculated using CNS.23 Luzatti/sA ° coordinate errors were calculated to 0.23/0.28 A and ° for the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA and 0.25/0.29 A hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structures, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Overall description of the structural models The ternary hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure comprises 309 residues, 183 structural water oxygen atoms, one THA molecule, one BH4 molecule and one sulphate ion (occupancy 0.75). The structure was refined to a working R-factor of 19.9% and a free R-factor of 22.9%. The ternary hPheOHFe(II)·BH4·NLE structure comprises 308 residues, 149 structural water oxygen atoms, one NLE molecule, one BH4 molecule and one sulphate ion (occupancy 0.75). This structure was refined to a working R-factor of 21.3% and a free R-factor of 24.3%. As previously observed for all crystal structures of the catalytic domain (DN1-102/DC428452)-hPheOH7,16 ­ 19 interpretable electron density was not observed for residues at both the N and C termini. Consequently, residues 103 ­ 116 and

ternary hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structure are two histidine residues, one bidentate glutamate and a single water molecule (Table 2). The electron density clearly shows active-site ligands His285, His290 and ° the bidentate Glu330 in both 2.0 A models (Figure 2). In addition, the electron density for the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structure revealed a clear ° Fo 2 Fc peak 2.1 A from the iron (Figure 2(b)) and, although the 2Fo 2 Fc density at the peak could not be separated from the electron density of the iron, a water ligand was included but refined to a high B-factor (Table 2). The present hPheOHFe(II)·BH4·THA structure has a similar iron environment except for the water ligand7 that was not included in the model. The iron proximity of the refined structure revealed some electron density that was difficult to interpret. The maps gave an Fo 2 Fc density peak (4.5s) in a position inside ° the 2Fo 2 Fc density (1.0s) at a distance of 1.6 A ° from BH4 O4. The from the iron and only 2.1 A iron distance is rather short for a ligand bond and BH4 O4 is too close to form a hydrogen bond to a

water ligand in this position. A second Fo 2 Fc ° density peak (4.4s) was observed 2.6 A from the iron but in a position lacking 2Fo 2 Fc density (1.0s). Refinement of a water molecule at this pos° ition resulted in a high B-factor (53 A2) as well as 2Fo 2 Fc density at the noise level. The results indicate that a water ligand can only be present at a very low occupancy. A plausible structural explanation for the omit density near the iron was not found, and consequently neither water ligands nor CO (see Materials and Methods) were included in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure. One may speculate that the undefined density can be related to traces of Fe(II)-CO species, but more experiments are required to unequivocally establish the CO/O2 binding site.

PheOH the enzyme can hydroxylate/oxidise a few other amino acid residues (e.g. L -tryptophan and L -methionine) and analogues (e.g. THA and NLE) when full-length rat phenylalanine hydroxylase (rPheOH) is artificially activated.11 The methods used for activation include an interaction with lysolecithin (ionic detergent), alkylation of a sulfhydryl group (Cys237) by N-ethylmaleimide and limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin, treatments which have been found to cause various structural changes in the enzyme. However, in addition to being a substrate, THA is also able to activate the full-length enzyme.9,10 In the present study we have solved the catalytic core structures of the ternary complexes for two of these non-physiological substrates, THA and NLE, in addition to measure the catalytic activity with these substrates. A superposition of the two structures in the area of the active site is shown in Figure 3. The two substrates bind at the same site, and the THA site is identical ° with that previously reported at 2.5 A.7 The hydrogen-bonding patterns of the carboxyl and amino groups of both substrates are presented in Table 3. The thiophene ring of THA packs against the

imidazole group of His285 with an average inter° planar distance of 3.8 A and hydrophobic inter° actions shorter than 4.0 A are observed to Tyr138 11 h2 C , Trp326 C , Phe331 C11 and Cz, Gly346 Ca and Ser350 Cb. The alkyl group of NLE interacts with the imidazole group of His285 at an average dis° tance of 3.9 A, and other hydrophobic interactions are observed to Trp326 Ch2 and Cz3 and Ser350 Cb. Although the overall conformational changes observed on the binding of THA or NLE are similar, some differences are observed between the two structures. The hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structure can be superimposed on the hPheOHFe(II)·BH4·THA structure using RgbSup (Paula Fitzgerald, unpublished program) with an r.m.s. ° deviation of 0.18 A for the Ca atoms, which is in the same range as the estimated coordinate error for the models. However, minor differences include different positions of the carbonyl group of Pro279 and different conformations of its side-chain (Figures 3 and 4). In the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure the carbonyl oxygen of Pro279 points away from THA (Figure 4(a)), whereas in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structure (Figure 4(b)) the ° oxygen is displaced 2.5 A, pointing almost towards NLE to accommodate the smaller side-chain of the substrate. Electron density in the hPheOHFe(II)·BH4·NLE structure reveals an unambiguous position for the Pro279 carbonyl group, whereas, the electron density in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure indicates two alternative positions for this carbonyl. The less occupied (, 20%) of these positions is similar to the single position observed in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structure. Moreover, minor differences are observed in the surroundings of Pro279. Thus, the main chain of ° residues 142­ 159 is located 0.2 ­ 0.8 A further from the substrate in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure than in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structure. Several side-chains near Pro279, notably Tyr154, Arg158 and Tyr268, have slightly different conformations in the two structures (Figure 4), with maximum displacements of 2.5, 2.0 and ° 0.8 A, respectively. Additional differences include the side-chain of Phe149 that is defined in the

their positions in the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure. The protein interactions to the thiophene group of THA and to the alkyl group of NLE are obviously somewhat dissimilar, although the x1 and x2 side-chain torsion angles are almost conserved (Figure 3). In addition, the hydrogen bonding patterns of the carboxyl and amino groups are identical, with only minor variations in the hydrogen bonding distances in the two structures (Table 3). This finding supports the assumption that the positions of the carboxyl and amino groups, and x1 and x2 angles are the same for 7 L -Phe and THA as well as the conclusion that the amino and carboxyl moieties in the substrate are the key factors in substrate binding, thus explaining the wide non-physiological substrate specificity observed for the artificially activated forms of PheOH.5,11 The side-chain, however, determines the substrate binding affinity, the specific activity and the efficiency of coupling between BH4 oxidation and substrate hydroxylation. The hydroxylation position in NLE (C1)11 and the putative position in THA (C11) are equivalent, with an iden° tical distance to the active-site iron (4.1 A) and only ° apart in the superimposed structures 0.24 A (Figure 3). By contrast to NLE, the product formed with THA as the substrate has not been identified.5,11 However, the catalytic activity (at 1 mM) for NLE is only , 5% of that for THA as the substrate (Figure 5) when measured via the oxidation of NADH coupled to the regeneration of BH4 catalyzed by dihydropteridine reductase.24 Whereas, THA revealed saturation kinetics with an apparent Km value of 395(^ 43) mM, no saturation was reached for the low activity measured with NLE (Figure 5), indicating also a low-affinity binding of this analogue. In addition, it should be noted that the hydroxylation (alkyl oxygenation) of NLE has been reported to be only , 50% coupled to BH4 oxidation with artificially activated (lysolecithin) full-length rPheOH.11 Whereas, NLE is not a substrate for the native wild-type PheOH,11

THA is both a substrate and an activator of this enzyme form.9,10 An additional interesting difference was observed between THA and the natural substrate L -Phe, both in terms of the time-course for the BH4 oxidation and the relationship between substrate concentration and catalytic activity. Whereas, the time-course for NADH oxidation with THA as the substrate was almost linear for at least ten minutes, the L -Phe-dependent oxidation revealed an initial transient (non-linear) faster rate followed by a slower linear rate (data not shown). Furthermore, in contrast to THA, substrate inhibition was observed with L -Phe (Figure 5). This is in agreement with previous steady-state kinetics measured with L -Tyr as the product;19 the coupling efficiency of the double truncated form of the enzyme (i.e. moles of L -Tyr formed per mole of BH4 oxidized) was 1.0 with L -Phe as the substrate. Both non-activated and substrate-activated rPheOH have, in the presence of the natural BH4 pterin cofactor, similar activities with THA as for the fully coupled hydroxylation of L -Phe.11 These results have recently been confirmed for the tetrameric wt-hPheOH enzyme.9 Molecular motions related to substrate binding Both crystal structures of the substrate complexes presented here have the same overall fold. Superposition of the binary hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4 (PDB id code 1J8U) and the ternary hPheOHFe(II)·BH4·THA (PDB id code 1MMK) structures (Figure 6(a)) using the program RgbSup (Paula Fitzgerald, unpublished program) reveals that substrate binding triggers structural changes throughout the entire protomer. The most obvious of these are the refolding of a surface loop (residues 134 ­ ° 139) with maximum Ca displacement of 9.6 A for Tyr138 which is relocated from a surface position (Figures 6(a) and 8) to a position partially buried ° in the active site and a , 2.6 A displacement of the reduced pterin cofactor towards Glu286 and the

754 ferrous iron (Figure 6(b) and (c)).7 Additional large molecular motions are observed for parts of the C terminus associated with two hinge-bending regions (Figures 6 and 7). The first hinge region is at the end of the a-helix formed by residues 181­201 which in the substrate-free structures has a sharp bend in the region at Leu197. Substrate binding causes significant changes in the f and c angles of Leu197 (39.18 and 220.98, respectively) resulting in a straightening of the a-helix (Figure 7). The second hinge is located in the 219­ 226 loop and centred on Asn223 (Figure 7), a residue that is conserved in all mammalian PheOHs. On substrate binding the f and c torsion angles of Asn223 change by 2 24.48 and 2 7.48, respectively. The two hinge-bending regions appear to be tightly linked, and the molecular motions of the residues between the hinge regions (197 ­ 223) is transmitted to other parts of the protomer by direct contacts with the 333 ­ 336 and 339 ­342 b-strands and the 351 ­356 and 392 ­403 a-helices. Thus, substrate binding creates large motions of the 333 ­ 336, 363 ­ 366 and 385 ­ 389 b-strands as well as of the 351 ­356, 369 ­372 and 392 ­403 a-helices (Figure 6(c)). The latter a-helix is tilted , 158 relative to its orientation in the substrate-free binary structure. Thus, substrate binding to the active site represents the epicentre for the large conformational changes in double truncated hPheOH. As recently proposed7 these changes are likely related to the global conformational changes that have been observed on substrate binding to the full-length tetrameric enzyme.8,10,13,25 ­ 27 Binding of either THA or NLE causes a slightly more compact structure, and a partial closure of the active site. The active-site pocket and the active-site channel17 are distinctly

Molecular Motions in Phenylalanine Hydroxylase

separated from each other by formation of direct interactions between loop residues Pro279 and Thr380 in the ternary complex. Thus, hydrophobic interactions are formed in the ternary hPheOHFe(II)·BH4·THA complex with a Pro279 Cb-Thr380 ° Ca distance of 3.8 A. No interactions (correspond° ing distance of 9.1 A) are formed between these loop residues in the binary hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4 complex. Hence, a displacement of the regulatory domain, including the N-terminal autoregulatory sequence which is adjacent to the loop containing Tyr138 in the substrate-bound structures (Figure 8), is likely to occur upon substrate binding and may thus represent an essential conformational change related to substrate activation of the full-length enzyme. Moreover, L -Phe binding shifts the tetramer/dimer equilibrium in the full-length enzyme towards the tetrameric form.28,29 This effect can be explained in our model by extension of the conformational change into the tetramerization domain. On the basis of the known static structures (endpoint conformations) of the binary and ternary 3-D structures of the catalytic domain (Figure 6(b) and (c)) the conformational switching related to substrate binding is visualized in a "movie" format14,15 on the web at: ID ¼ 571404-31794. This gives a plausible representation of the pathway of motion. As observed for the biphasic change in refractive index as measured in real time by surface plasmon resonance analysis8,10 for the fulllength tetrameric/dimeric hPheOH, this conformational switching is in the second-to-minute timescale. Thus, the molecular motions observed in the catalytic domain on substrate binding offer a clue to our understanding of the relation between structure and function of PheOH and also provide

Materials and Methods
Enzyme purification and crystallization The double truncated form (DN1-102/DC428-452) of hPheOH was expressed as a fusion protein with maltosebinding protein in Escherichia coli.30 The fusion protein was cleaved by factor Xa, and hPheOH dimer was separated by size-exclusion chromatography.28 Crystallization and handling of the crystals were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere.16 Binary hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4 crystals were grown by the hanging-drop method using 20% (w/v) PEG2000, 12% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.12 M Na-Hepes (pH 6.8), 10 mM BH4, and 30 mM Na-dithionite as a reducing agent. The concentration of the protein solution was 7 ­ 8 mg/ml. The ternary complex with THA was formed by soaking (24 hours) binary crystals in reservoir solution 50% saturated with THA (,20 mM), while the ternary NLE complex was formed by adding solid NLE in excess (,40 mM) to the drop and allowing diffusion for 24 hours. Drops of both crystal complexes were exposed to CO gas (at 6 atm) for three minutes in an attempt to obtain information on the CO (and thus the O2) binding site (see Results). Crystals were flash-frozen by direct transfer from the drop to liquid nitrogen 30 minutes after the exposure to CO. Data collection and processing Data for the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure were  http://molmovdb.mbb.yale.edu/cgi-bin/morph.cgi?

collected at ID14-EH1 at the European Synchrotron Radi° ation Facility (ESRF) using a wavelength of 0.934 A and an ADSC Q4R CCD detector. A total of 150 successive images of 0.58 rotation were collected using a single crystal of the approximate size 0.4 mm £ 0.1 mm £ 0.05 mm. Data for the hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE structure were collected at the Swiss ­ Norwegian Beamline (BM01) at ° ESRF using a wavelength of 0.800 A and a MAR345 Research imaging plate system. A total of 89 successive images of 18 rotation were collected using a single crystal of the approximate size 0.4 mm £ 0.1 mm £ 0.05 mm. Both data sets were collected in a cryo-stream of nitrogen (110 K), thus preventing oxidation of Fe(II) during data collection. Processing of the data sets was done using DENZO version 1.96.631 followed by scaling and merging using SCALA version 4.1 in the CCP4 program suite.32 Statistics from the data collection and processing are presented in Table 1. Refinement and model building The refinement and model building procedure was ° similar for both structures. The 2.5 A hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4· THA structure (PDB code 1KW0), using the protein plus iron part only, was used as starting model. Cross-validation was applied by excluding 10% of the reflections throughout the refinement procedure. Rigid body, simulated annealing followed by several rounds of combined refinement (simulated annealing, energy minimization and B-factor refinement) were completed using CNS version 1.0.23 The graphical programme O33 combined with sA-weighted34 2Fo 2 Fc and Fo 2 Fc maps calculated in CNS were used for manual adjustments of the structures. Water molecules were gradually included as oxygen atoms after each round of combined refinement. Applying appropriate hydrogen bonding criteria, solvent atoms were included to Fo 2 Fc and 2Fo 2 Fc densities with minimum peak heights of 4.0 and 1.0s, respectively.

Molecular Motions in Phenylalanine Hydroxylase

Cofactor and substrate were included early in the combined refinement procedure due to their clear electron density reflecting unambiguous atom positions. A summary of the statistics from the data collection and the final models is shown in Table 1. Visualisation of molecular motions On the basis of the known static structures (endpoint conformations) of the binary (PDB code 1J8U) and ternary (PDB code 1MMK) 3-D structures of the catalytic domain of hPheOH the conformational switching related to substrate binding is visualized in a "movie" format14,15 on the web at: ID ¼ 571404-31794. Assay of enzyme activity PheOH activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measurement of the initial rate of substratedependent NADH oxidation at 25 8C.24 The assay mixture contained the following components in a final volume of 1 ml:9 187 mM Na-Hepes buffer pH 7, 0.05 mg/ml of catalase, ten units of superoxide dismutase, 200 mM NADH, excess dihydropteridine reductase, 3 mg of hPheOH catalytic domain in 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mM ferrous ammonium sulphate, a variable concentration of substrate (L -Phe, THA or NLE) and 100 mM BH4. The reaction was initiated by addition of the pterin cofactor. The amount of L -Tyr formed was measured by HPLC as described,13 and the molar ratio of hydroxylation of L -Phe to the oxidation of BH4 (i.e. the coupling efficiency) was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient 1 ¼ 6220 M21 cm21 for NADH. Protein Data Bank accession numbers Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB), Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), with accession numbers 1MMK and 1MMT for the hPheOHFe(II)·BH4·THA and hPheOH-Fe(II)·BH4·NLE, respectively.
