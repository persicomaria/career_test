Summary - Four crystal structures of transfer RNA molecules were refined at 3 ,A resolution with the inclusion of the solvent molecules found in the difference maps: yeast tRNA-phe in the orthorhombic form, yeast tRNA-phe in the monoclinic form and yeast tRNA-asp in the A and B forms. Over 100 solvent molecules were located in each tRNA crystal. Several hydration schemes are found repeatedly in the 4 crystals. The tertiary interactions in the corner of the L-shaped molecule attract numerous solvent molecules which bridge the ribose hydroxyl 0(2') atoms, base exocyclic atoms and phosphate anionic oxygen atoms. Conservation of bases leads to conservative localized hydration patterns. Several solvent molecules are found stabilizing unusual base pairs like the G - U pairs and those involving the pseudouridine base. Water bridges between the 0(2') and the exocyclic atom 02 of pyrimidines or the N3 atom of purines are common. Water bridges occur frequently between successive anionic oxygen atoms of each strand as well as between N7 or other exocyclic atoms of successive bases in the major groove. Magnesium ions or spermine molecules are found to bind in the major groove of tRNA helices without specific interactions.
hydration / solvent / tRNA / X-ray crystallography

Introduction
Knowledge of the aqueous hydration of biological macromolecules is essential for the understanding of the tertiary structures of biomolecules, the interactions between them and their functions. Usually, tRNA crystals have a high solvent content, between 60 and 75% [1]. Most of the solvent molecules occupy the solvent channels between the loosely packed tRNA molecules, exchange dynamically with the mother liquor surrounding the crystal and can be considered in a state identical to bulk phase solution. These solvent m o l e cules lead to featureless electron density and contribute predominantly to the low-angle region of the diffraction pattern [2, 3]. That region is usually excluded from the data used in the refinement [4]. A small percentage of the

crystal solvent is crystallographically ordered and forms the hydration shell or the bound water of the macromolecule. The definition of bound water is necessarily operational and depends upon the technique used to determine it [5]. With X-ray crystallography, one can identify localized hydration sites, that is sites on the macromolecule surface which are locally stable so that these positions are, on an average, frequently occupied by solvent molecules. Depending upon the temperature factor and the occupancy of the site, one speaks of a tightly or weakly bound solvent molecule, although these two parameters reflect the attraction potential of the site for solvent molecules. The amount of information about the solvent structure around a macromolecule that one can extract from the diffraction data

molecules. The details of the refinement of the A-form of yeast tRNA-asp has recently been described (P. Dumas, E. W e s t h o f and D. Moras, submitted). Several results of these comparative refinements have already been addressed and discussed [15, 16]. Here, the solvation of these 4 tRNA molecules are described, compared and discussed.

depends strongly upon the resolution of the data and on the state qf the refinement of crystal structure. At 2-3 A resolution, only the strongly bound solvent molecules are expected to be extracted [6, 7]. In the present analysis, data between 10 and 3 A resolution were used. Therefore, one aim of the study was to compensate for the relatively low resolution by refining and analyzing data from 4 different tRNA crystals and from 3 different laboratories. The same refinement program was used, but 2 methods for extracting the solvent peaks were employed. This was done, since it is known that the interpretation of solvent density involves some degree of subjective j u d g m e n t (e.g. [8]). With these approaches, it was hoped that the analysis and the comparisons of the solvent structures in the 4 tRNA crystals would ),ield a meaningful and consistent picture of the organization of solvent molecules around tRNA molecules. The 4 crystals of yeast tRNA molecules analyzed were: yeast tRNA-phe in the orthorhombic form, yeast tRNA-phe in the monoclinic form and yeast tRNA-asp in the A and B forms. The diffraction data for the orthorhombic form were from S.H. Kim's laboratory and the starting coordinates as well [9, 10]. The monoclinic form of yeast tRNA-phe [11, 12] was refined using the data from M. Sundaralingam's laboratory [13]. For the B-form of yeast tRNA-asp, the already published refinement [14] was pursued in order to extract the solvent

Crystallographic refinement
The refinement techniques used for these 4 tRNA crystals have been described ([13, 14, 17], P. Dumas et al., submitted). For the refinement of the 4 crystals, about the same n u m b e r of data (see Table I) between 10 and 3 A, were used [16]. ,In principle [18], with interplanar spacings of 3 A, details separated by more than 2.1 A can be seen. Other factors will, however, increase this value so that it may be difficult to resolve peaks involved in H-bonds, which are typically separated by 2.6-3.1 ~,. Usually, the assignment of solvent peaks to particular chemical entities is made on the basis of the geometric parameters associated with the peak. However, at 3 A resolution, water molecules cannot be distinguished from, say, an a m m o n i u m ion. Sodium or magnesium ions can be assigned in terms of distances and coordination. At best, we might thus expect to observe the more ordered solvent sites and some local water networks in crevices or channels O " "t i-l e iili:l.l,,;iu-l molecular surfaces without any specific details

on the water structure itself. In addition, Savage [19] has remarked that the use of O...O distance criteria alone for H-bonding may be misleading, since he observed water molecules or hydroxyl groups partially surrounded by water molecules that do not form H-bonds to the enclosed species despite intermolecular distances between 3.1 and 3.5 ,~. In the refinement process, both the temperature factors and the occupancies of the solvent peaks have been refined in successive passes. Analysis of refinement results of DNA oligomers at higher resolution had shown that refinement of both temperature factors and occupancies was meaningful [ 20, 21]. At the resolution of the tRNA crystals, this would appear less likely. However, analysis of occupancies and temperature factors of solvent molecules in the 4 tRNA crystals reveals that these 2 parameters possess some physicochemical significance even at the resolution used. The occupancy, being mainly determined by the low resolution data, would be expected to be more variable, whereas temperature factors depending upon data at high resolution might be less susceptible to move away from their starting values. Moreover the resolution range is narrow, so that a good determination of temperature factors is not expected.

form A of yeast tRNA-asp. It can be seen that solvent atoms with an occupancy of one cover the whole range of temperature factors. At the same time, the spread in occupancy appears to be larger for solvent atoms with high temperature factors. Therefore, one can not speak of a marked correlation of the occupancy and temperature factor of solvent peaks as seen at high resolution [22]. There could, however, be a correlation between occupancy range and spread in temperature factors. In other words, sites with high occupancy can be occupied by solvent molecules with low or high rms (root mean square) displacements, whereas solvent molecules with large temperature factors have a tendency for partial occupancy. This is apparent from the plot of form A of yeast tRNA-asp. In that case, the temperature factor was manually decreased if the occupancy stayed at one after 3 cycles of refinement. In the case of form B of yeast tRNA-asp, it was observed that the temperature factor did not vary much from the starting value.

In the plot of yeast tRNA-asp, the solvent peak with a very low temperature factor and an occupancy of 0.5 sites on a 2-fold axis. In the plot of yeast tRNA-phe, the solvent peaks with an occupancy of 0.5 are the hydration waters of two magnesium ions located in the major groove of the anti-codon helix which are at half occupancy (see [13]).

Further detailed analysis did not allow us to obtain more information on the types of atoms involved in the macromolecule (anionic oxygens or base atoms, for example). Fig. 2 shows stereo views of the sugar-phosphate backbone of each tRNA species with the solvent molecules. From this figure, it is apparent that the solvent distribution is not quite uniform. The corner of the L-shaped molecule has a higher concentration of solvent mole-

cules than the rest of the molecule, especially in the case of yeast tRNA-phe in the orthorhombic form. In the yeast tRNA-phe crystals, it is also the region of lowest temperature factors, i . e . , of least atomic mobility [9]. Thus, this observation reflects the fact that ordered solvent peaks are detected more easily around the less mobile nucleic acid atoms. However, because of the interactions between these solvent atoms and the nucleic acid atoms (see

Table II), some of these peaks must contribute also to the stabilization of that region rich in tertiary interactions and base-pairing. The interactions between the solvent molecules and the nucleic acid atoms will now be described in more detail. In Table I, the average numbers of contacts made by the water molecules with other water molecules and with the nucleic acid are given for the 4 crystal forms and for an A-DNA octamer [23]. The low number ofcontacts with other water molecules reflects the low resolution of the tRNA data. The similarity between the average numbers of contacts to nucleic acid atoms, not only in the four crystal forms but also in the A-DNA crystal (1.7 ,~ resolution), gives some confidence in the analysis. The average number of contacts made by the water molecules to the sugar atoms is 3 times larger in the tRNAs than in the A-DNA octamer, naturally because of the presence of the ribose hydroxyl 0(2'). For

the A-form of yeast tRNA-asp the average values are less than those of the other tRNAs. This reflects the method employed for picking up the solvent peaks (P. Dumas et ai., submitted), which puts more emphasis on contacts between the macromolecule and the solvent than on contacts between the solvent peaks themselves. With the experience gained in the refinement process and ana:ysis of the results, the following directions for searching solvent peaks at such resolution can be given. First, it is worthwhile to refine alternatively occupancy and temperature factor of solvent peaks. Secondly, the temperature factor has to be manually decreased either if the occupancy stays at 1.0 after cycles of refinement or according to the average temperature factor of the atoms with which the solvent peaks interact. And thirdly, the search for new solvent peaks has to be made on the basis of contacts not only with the macromolecule but also with the

Hydration of tRNA
already determined solvent peaks. The difference maps should also be frequently searched and viewed for large or longish peaks, sometimes without direct contact with the macromolecule, to pick up molecules like spermine. Tables II-IV present the bridges and i:ontacts between the solvent molecules and the 4 tRNA molecules in the helical stems (Table III), in the loop regions (Table II), and between symmetrically-related molecules (Table IV). In Tables II and IV, the water bridges are arranged with increasing residue number and so as to be on the same level in different structures. It is interesting to compare the positions of the solvent molecules determined in the present refinement of the orthorhombic form of yeast tRNA-phe and in the previous one, for which coordinates of 83 solvent positions have been deposited at the Brookhaven Data Bank [9]. Of those solvent peaks, 50 are within 1.7 A in the two refinements with the 4 magnesium sites within 0.6 ,A. Besides the hydration waters

Those shown on the last 4 lines are most probably, due to the resolution, two-water bridges instead of one-water bridges.

of the magnesium ions, 15 of the peaks within 1.7 ,A are bound to anionic phosphate oxygen atoms and 10 to hydroxyl 0(2') atoms. Thus, excepting the magnesium ions and their waters of hydration, about 40% of the solvent peaks are common to both refinements. The water bridges found in the two refinements are marked by a dark diamond in Tables II and IV. Similar values were reached after other comparative refinement studies. Thus, the rerefinement of the B-dodecamer d ( C - G - C - G A - A - T - T - C - G - C - G ) indicated that at most, half of the assigned solvent peaks were common to both refinements, with the hydration spine down the minor groove particularly well conserved [24]. The latter point was also noted after the refinement of the same dodecamer with a G - A pair [25]. Similarly, a comparison of two independently refined models of ribonuclease A at 2.0 A resolution showed that just over half of the solvents were in similar positions (within 1.9 ,A) with almost all of the best determined waters in the first shell of hydration [26]. That small percentage of the crystal solvent, which is crystallographically ordered and forms the first hydration shell or the bound water of the macromolecule, is especially crucial for understanding the role of water in the structure and stability ofbiomolecules.

Contacts within helical stems
Some of the water contacts in the helical Stems (Table III) are found repeatedly. They occur in water bridges involving either the ribose hydroxyl 0(2') and 02 of pyrimidine bases (N3 of purine bases) or the 0(2') atom and the ribose endocyclic oxygen 0(4') of the next residue. They also occur in water bridges involving the phosphate oxygens and will be described below. It has already been noticed that the hydroxyl oxygen atom 0(2') of a sugar residue often forms a hydrogen-bond to the sugar ring oxygen atom 0(4') of the next residues when the two residues belong to a helical stem [10, 14, 27]. In Table III, it can be seen that, not unfrequently, a water molecule links these two atoms. Often, the same bridging water molecule also links the hydroxyl 0(2') to the N3 (purine) or the 02 (pyrimidine) of the attached base (Fig. 3, top). This pattern was often seen in smaller nucleic acid fragments [28-30]. Also, in the structure of r(ApU) [31], a

156

E. Westhof et al.

water molecule links the hydroxyl 0(2') to the ring 0(4') of the next residue. Water molecules binding in that small cavity of the minor groove certainly contribute to the stabilization of the A-type helix typical of RNA molecules. Paradoxically, such water molecules might play a crucial role in the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of RNA molecules by participating, under appropriate conditions, in the removal of a proton from 0(2') which can then attack the phosphodiester linkage.

It is interesting that most of the G - U pairs of the 4 structures have these water bridges (Fig. 3, middle). With a G - U pair, the minor groove is slightly deeper and water molecules tend to be stabilized in such a cavity (for a similar effect, see the case of the Z-DNA oligomers [20]). Also, in the cases of two G - U pairs, the water molecule hydrogen-bonded to the 0(2') and 02 of the uracil makes an additional hydrogen-bond to the amino group N2 of the guanine (Fig. 3, middle). Similarly, the unusual base

In yeast tRNA-asp, the solvent peak linking two symmetrically-related O2P atoms of residue G10 was assigned an occupancy of one-half. That peak could well be an ammonium ion. Notice how the solvent-mediated links between symmetry-related molecules building up the crystal are well preserved in the two refinements of the orthorhombic form yeast tRNA-phe and in the two forms ofyeast tRNA-asp.

Close association o f water m o l e c u l e s with the functional g r o u p s o f m i s m a t c h e d bases was also observed in D N A oligomers [36, 37]. Because of the a b s e n c e o f the hydroxyl 0 ( 2 ' ) atom, hydration is extensive on the m a j o r groove side in D N A with a water m o l e c u l e bridging the N2 of g u a n i n e and the 0 2 o f t h y m i n e .

sites form intra- or inter-strand bridges (purine N7/O6/N6 to either purine N7/O6/N6 or pyrimidine N4/O4). These water bridges can involve up to 4 bases belonging either to 2 consecutive base pairs or to each strand but staggered, tRNA-asp, which has a sequence of four G - C base pairs in the thymine stem, presents (especially in form A) the interesting situation of 2 separate water networks without much interaction between them, one bonding

to the guanine strand and the other to the cytosine strand. In A-DNA oligomers, onewater bridges are generally not frequent, especially in the major grove; instead two-water bridges are observed [21]. In this study, mainly one-water bridges have been observed. We suspect that these one-water bridges are an artifact due to the low resolution, which tends to smear the peaks so that two-water bridges may appear as one-water bridges.

Thus, the base triple between base pairs 10-25 and base 45, which is held only through the interactions between the amino group of G45 and the O6/N7 of G !9, is further stabilized by at least 2 water molecules (see Fig. 4, bottom). This base triple is important for the overall stability of the tRNA molecule, since it is at the interface between the dihydrouridine stem and the anti-codon stem. In the two types of tRNA molecules, there is also a water molecule bridging the exocyclic group at position 6 of the conserved purine 24 with guanine 45, which is also a conserved purine. Other water bridges are found in similar positions in the 4 structures; for example, between pseudouridine 55 (N1 or 02) and an anionic oxygen atom of either thymine 54 or the base 58 (Fig. 5). Notice in Fig. 5 how water molecules, anionic oxygen atoms, and carbonyl oxygen atoms surround the methyl group of thymine T54. As already suggested [39], the presence of a water molecule on the pseudouridine 55 might explain the peculiar NMR effects [39, 40] observed on the N1 proton of tile pseudouridine 55 upon removal of magnesium ions or of spermine. Most of these water molecules clearly help stabilize tight turns or loops. Such is the case of the water molecule(s) bridging O2P of U59 and the exocyclic atom at

Solvent contacts in the loops and tertiary interactions
The solvent contacts in the non-helical regions are quite interesting, on the one hand, by their variety, and on the other hand, by their positions. Some bridging water molecules are found in the two types of tRNA molecules studied. In the comparison of crystallographic structures, one should keep in mind that the hydration networks of nucleic acids are very dynamic. Further, variations or rearrangements in local geometry, as well as changes in crystallization conditions, can lead to changes in the water structure. The occurrence of two identical hydration schemes in different crystals is therefore of significance; for example, the water molecule linking 0 4 of U8 to the anionic oxygen O1P of AI4 in the reversedHoogsteen U8-A14 base pair (Fig. 4, top). This water molecule helps stabilize the reversedHoogsteen pair at this tight corner of the molecule. It would be interesting to analyze the effect of a 4-thiouridine at position 8 with the presence of a bridging water molecule. In the monoclinic form of yeast tRNA-phe, this bridging water molecule is linked to two other water molecules, one of which is hydrogen bonded to O2P of U7 and the other one to N7 of G15. Three other water bridges are found in yeast tRNA-phe and in yeast tRNA-asp. One links 0(2') of A9 with N3 of G45; the same water

Also, two water molecules help form a ring oofoxygen atoms around ihe methyl group. The distance between the second water molecule and the methyl group is 3.1 A.

position 4 of base 60 (see Table II). The hydroxyl atom 0(2') makes a large number of direct intramolecular contacts, thereby playing a crucial role in the stabilization of the secondary and tertiary structures [10, 14, 27]. Above, it was already noted that water molecules might participate in these intramolecular contacts. Many water bridges involving the hydroxyl 0(2') atom in Table II reinforce the role of the 0(2') atom in the stabilization of the tertiary folding. Another example is shown in Fig. 6 where a water molecule which fits snugly into a cavity of the structure hydrogen bonds to three residues: the amino group of A21, the hydroxyl group of G46, and an anionic oxygen atom of C48. In the structure of form B of yeast tRNA-asp, the most complex solvent network involves residues 20-21-22-23 and 46 and 6 solvent molecules. Such a network is not observed in the yeast tRNA-phe structures around that region. It has been observed that phosphate 22 is more accessible to ethylnitrosourea in tRNA-phe than in tRNA-asp [41]. The water network observed in the crystal might, contribute to the protection of phosphate 22. In the monoclinic form of yeast tRNA-phe, the most complex network involves nine water molecules and residues 6, 7, 8, 14 and 15. In the orthorhombic form, there are 2 networks, each comprising 5 water molecules; one links 15, 20, 58, 59 and 60 and the other 7, 8, 15, 48 and 49. These networks are detailed in Table !!. The special hydration of the pseudouridine base is again exemplified in yeast tRNA-asp for residue 32, where a water molecule links residue 32 to an anionic oxygen of base 37 (Fig. 7). This site is a gold site which was used

161

in the structure solution stage. Interestingly, in the orthorhombic form of yeast tRNA-phe, the same site is occupied by a water molecule of the coordination sphere of the magnesium ion bound to the anti-codon loop. Another such example is described below. In the monoclinic form of yeast tRNA-phe, there is also such an example of a water site which is occupied by a lanthanide ion in crystals soaked with lanthanide salts. This water molecule links N 1 of G20 to 0(4') of A21.

Contacts involving the phosphate group anionic oxygen atoms

In Tables I1 and III, the participation of the anionic oxygens of the phosphate grou0 is apparent. First, in helical stems, the anionic oxygen O1P interacts frequently with the N7 of p u n n e residues through one (Fig. 8, top) or two water molecules (Fig. 8, bottom). Such a scheme has been observed in nucleotide structures (e.q., [42]). It should be noted that no water bridge between the ribose hydr,q×y! 0(2') and an anionic oxygen of the 3'-phosphate was found. Such bridges h a v e b e e n suggested on the basis of NMR experiments [43]. In the case of pyrimidines, instances have been found of a water bridging the anionic oxygen O1P to the C5 or C6, or the methyl group on C5.

molecules (see Fig. 5). A characteristic of the contacts in the non-helical regions is that both the hydroxyl atom 0(2') and the anionic oxygen atoms are frequently involved in water bridges. In yeast tRNA-asp, the water molecule bridging the anionic oxygen atoms of residues 8 and 9 is replaced by a gadolinium ion after soaking the crystal in gadolinium sulfate. As above for the water molecule linking 32 and 37, this water molecule belongs to the coordination sphere of the magnesium ion bound to the P10-1oop in the orthorhombic crystal of yeast tRNA-phe. Water molecules very often bridge phosphate atoms of the same ~-esidue or of adjacent residues on the same strand (Table III). The latter bridges are frequent in crystals of DNA oligomers in the A forms [23, 45]. Water bridges to phosphates are also involved in strings of water molecules which can span 4 or 5 residues across the major groove from one strand to the other in the 5'-direction. Some examples of these strings can be seen in A form tetramer structure [46]. The water molecules take the shortest path from one strand to the other, as is observed in loop formation by unpaired residues [47].

Intermolecular contacts mediated by water
mo|ecnh~ In the orthorhombic form of yeast tRNA-phe and in yeast tRNA-asp, several intermolecular contacts are mediated by water molecules (Table IV). Again, several of these contacts involve either the 0(2') atom or an anionic oxygen atom. The least amount of intermolecular water bridges is found in the monoclinic form of yeast tRNA-phe. It is also the form with the smallest number of direct intermolecular contacts.

interactions between the thymine and the dihydrouridine loops ; one ion binds directly to the anionic oxygen atoms of residues 20 and 21; and finally, there is a magnesium ion interacting through its water molecules with residues 31,32, 37, 38 and 39 of the anti~codon loop. The same locations were found in the monoclinic form of yeast tRNA-phe with variants in the anti-codon loop [10, 13]. In the structure of yeast tRNA-asp, no magnesium ion sites could be detected with certainty, although there is a possible site in the anti-codon loop. In this regard, one should mention that these crystals were grown in high ionic strength and, thus, it is not unexpected that the magnesium ions should be quite mobile and not visible in difference maps. As mentioned above, two water sites in yeast tRNA-asp are identical with a water site of two hydrated magnesium ions. In tRNA-phe crystals, spermine molecules could not be identified, although close to a site in the major groove of the anti-codon stem previously assigned to a spermine molecule [10, 48], two magnesium ions that occupy one-half were identified in both forms. In tRNA-asp, a spermine molecule was positively identified in the major groove of the amino acid stem (P. Dumas et aL, submitted). Both results indicate that large counter-ions bind in the major groove of RNA helices and that specific interactions are not necessary for binding. Such conclusions were also reached on the basis of theoretical calculations [50, 51].

Conclusions
A large number of solvent molecules have been detected in each tRNA crystal. Despite the low resolution, several hydration schemes were found repeatedly in all 4 crystals or in the 2 types of transfer RNA molecules. Thus, the conservation or semi-conservation of bases in transfer RNA molecules leads to conservative localized hydration patterns. The role of some water molecules is clearly related to a stabilization of the secondary and tertiary interactions, since these water molecules bridge ribose hydroxyl 0(2') atoms, base exocyclic atoms and phosphate anionic oxygen atoms, which otherwisewould not be hydrogen bonded. This is quite apparent in the case ofunusual base pairs,

The magnesium ions and spermine molecules
Four magnesium ions were localized in yeast tRNA-phe [10, 11, 48, 49]: one ion binds fully hydrated to phosphates 8, 9, 11 and 12; one binds directly to O2P of G19 with its water molecules linking residues 15, 20, 56 (symmetrically-related), 59 and 60, thus stabilizing the

164

where bonds to water molecules tend to make for the loss of hydrogen bonding. The neglect of some of these localized water molecules can lead to distortion of the local environment during restrained least-squares refinement. A recent study showed that the extent and the location of the solvent shell around a transfer RNA molecule depends upon the solvent environment [52]. In 0.1 M NaCl, an excess mass of about 85 water molecules was determined [52]. Between 71 and 108 water molecules were localized in the present study and one can wonder whether some of these water molecules do not belong to the solvent shell of the polyion. The presence of numerous water molecules in the core of the elbow of the tRNA molecules should be taken into account when considering hinge flexibility in transfer RNA molecules "[53]. Also, the frequent occurence of some hydration sites and water bridges may prevent straightforward interpretations of NMR results. It is known that RNA structure is quite insensitive to variations in the degree of hydration but that magnesium ions are crucial for the maintenance of the tertiary structures of the complex structures of tRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. However, as described above, water molecules bound inside pockets formed by loops and stretches o f t h e polynucleotide backbone contribute further to the stabilization of the sh'ucture. A theoretical study has also emphasized the stabilizing effect of bound **at~ to loop ~1.1 ut;tuI C:~[2qJ. I nese water moiecules localized in notches and caviti s of the tertiary structure formed by the polynucleotide folding can be regarded as an integral part of the tRNA structure itself.
