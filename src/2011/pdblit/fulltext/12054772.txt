A systematic analysis of the kinetic properties of duck lens c-crystallin with lactate dehydrogenase[LDH, (E.C. 1.1.1.27)] activity was carried out by employing some 19 different a-keto acidsas substrates this NADH-dependent LDH-catalyzed reaction. The for steady-stateMichaelis and catalytic constants(Km, kcat) were determinedfor a broadrange of organic compounds.The results provide important insights regarding the binding and affinity of substrates active sitesof this enzyme crystallin and indicate a great potential to for the application of the stablec-crystallin asa catalyst to the synthesisof someimportant chiral a-hydroxyacids in a convenient andefficient way. It is alsodemonstrated the first for time that in addition to the enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase, duck e-crystallin alsopossesses enzymatic activity of malatedehydrogenase.

&-Crystallin, a relatively abundant lens protein (lo-20 % of total lensextract) present in someavian and reptilian species,was shown to possess L-lactate dehydrogenase an activity with high stability suitable for the application to enzyme technology [ 11.Lactate dehydrogenase a "house-keeping"nicotinamide-dependent is enzyme in the glycolysis, the major metabolic pathway that metabolizesglucoseto lactate and generates energy in the the form of ATP in the absenceof oxygen for most organisms [2]. Despite the structural similarities between&-crystallin and chicken heart-type lactate dehydrogenase, differences in charge and kinetic properties were revealed by isoenzyme electrophoresisand kinetic studies [3]. It was also shown that the L-LDH activity of &-crystallin were more stable towardsthermal denaturationthan other commerciallyavailablelactate dehydrogenases. The L-lactate dehydrogenases (L-LDHs) from conventional sources various animal of specieshave been selectedas a model of enzymes with considerablefuture promise in asymmetric synthesisbecause its broad substratespecificity and high enantioselectivity of [4,5].

crystallin can be obtained in high yields very easily and inexpensively from the eye lenses of some avian species, in this report a special effort is further directed to explore the range of some unnatural substrates accepted by &-crystallin and the stereochemical restraints involved in the binding of substrates to the active site of this enzyme crystallin.

MATERIALS

AND METHODS

General urocedure and isolation of &-crvstallin The isolation and purification procedures for duck &-crystallin were.the same as described previously [8]. Formate dehydrogenase (yeast: E.C. 1.2.1.2.) was obtained in lyophilized form from Boehringer-Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Enzymes used for kinetic measurements were dissolved in 30 mM phosphate buffer solution. Pyruvic acid was obtained from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). 3-Fluoropyruvic acid and mercaptopyruvic acid were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Other 2-0~0 acids, NADH, and NAD+ were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). Structural confirmation of the products was carried out by the combination of NMR and IR spectroscopies. Chemical shifts of `H-NMR and 13CNMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AM-200 using solvent peaks as references. IR spectra were recorded from KBr thin films with a Jasco IR-700. UV absorbance was measured in a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. The optical rotation was measured using a Universal Polarimeter (Schmidt 8 Haensch, Berlin, Germany). Gel electrophoresis of duck &-crystallin and authentic chicken heart and muscle LDHs SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel (5 % stacking/ 14 % resolving gel) electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was as described with some modifications 191.The gel was fixed in 12.5 % trichloroacetic acid, washed several times with 20 % methanol/ 7 % acetic acid and stained with Coomassie blue. Native gel (8 % resolving gel without stacking) electrophoresis was also adopted for the detection of LDH activity using nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5 methylphenazinium methylsulfate in the coupled oxido-reduction conversion of lactatemAD and pyruvate/NADH in Tris-glycine buffer of Davis as described before flOJ. Kinetic measurements The kinetic parameters of &-crystallin were measured according to the previous report [6]. The L-lactate dehydrogenase activities of e-crystallin were studied in*the direction of reduction in the presence of NADH in 30 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 25 "C by measuring the decrease in UV absorbance at 340 nm. The assay solution containing NADH (0.2 mM) and various concentrations of substrates plus different amounts of e-crystallin was dissolved in 30 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) before use. The concentrations of substrates were increased from 0.2 to 5 Km, and the amount of E-crystallin was increased by a factor of lOO-fold. The kinetic parameters were obtained from Eadie-Hofstee plots.

RESULTS

AND

DISCUSSION

Bioorganic synthesis based on enzymatic catalysis is providing an increasingly important tool in the methodology of enantioselective synthesis of valuable organic intermediates (i.e. chiral synthons) [4-61. Despite the numerous applications of enzymes for the generation of chiral synthons, the number of enzymes of broad synthetic capability that are readily and inexpensively available is somewhat restricted at present. The LDH group of enzymes is one whose preparation efficacy for chiral synthons has been demonstrated. We have previously demonstrated the facile synthesis of chiral 2-hydroxy 875

In this report we further explore the range of substrates which can be utilized by this unique enzymatic crystallin. Isolation and comoarisonof duck &-crvstallinsand authenticchicken LDHs By adopting the anion-exchange chromatography&-crystallin with a purity of about 90 % could be easily separated from other classes crystallins in a single-stepseparationand of purification [3,8]. The identification of &-crystallin asan LDH-like protein was previously demonstrated by native isoenzyme electrophoresis basedon activity staining for LDH [8,10] and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shownin Fig. 1. Rechromatography as of the &-crystallin fraction on the samecolumn usually obtainedover 99 % pure &-crystallin (lane 3 of Fig. 1). &-Crystallin showeda protein band of 37.5 kDa in contrast to a major 6 crystallin with a 50 kDa subunit. We have also compared the subunit structure of ecrystallin with thoseheart and muscleLDHs from chicken (lanes1 and 2 of Fig. 1). They were almostindistinguishable regardingthe molecularsizesof native and subunit structures [lo]. It is to be noted that in contrast to that found in the duck and caiman lensesEcrystallin cannot be detected in the chicken lens [11,12]. The distinct difference in the expressionof &-crystallin in somespecies Anatidae family and not in other poultry birds of hasattracted a lot of attention recently [ 131.The practical useof this stablecrystallin plus 6 crystallin to chiral synthesis beenour research has focus during the past few years [7,14]. Kinetic analvsisand substrate s-pecificitv To explore the range of substrates acceptedby &-crystallin, various 2-0~0 acids with different side-chainswere used in the LDH reaction catalyzed by &-crystallin in 30 mu phosphatebuffer at pH 7.2 and 25 OCin the direction of pyruvate reduction (Table 1).

aThe specific activities for reduction of pyruvate ( units per mg of enzyme) are 350, 160,250,270,365, 190 pmol min.`mg-`, respectively, for &-crystallin, rabbit muscle, porcine heart, bovine heart, chicken liver, and lobster tail L-lactate dehydrogenases. bKm is expressed in mM, Kcat and Kcar/Km are relative ratios based on pyruvate as 100 (cited in 161).

2 shows representative kinetic data corresponding to Eadie-Hofstee plots for the reactions of 2-hydroxypyruvate and 2-fluoropyruvate, the correlation coefficient being Xl.99 in each case. The reported values of kinetic data from other sources of lactate dehydrogenases were cited from the studies of others [6]. Although the values of Km of duck &-crystallin are slightly larger than those of other LDHs crystallin are significantly of different sources, the values of Kcat of Elarger than those catalytic constants reported for LDHs of other

sources for various substrates. The most interesting observation in Table 1 is that the values of Kcat of compounds 1, 3, and 10 are larger than that for the natural substrate of pyruvate, as summarized in Table 2. Moreover, &-crystallin possessed high enzyme activity for the reduction of oxaloacetic acid (Table 1, compound 16). This result indicated that it had not only L-lactate dehydrogenase activity but also malate dehydrogenase activity. In order to investigate the specificity of this latter enzymatic activity, we have selected three 3-0~0 acids and one 40x0 acid (Table 2) as the substrates for &-crystallin. Results indicated that E-crystallin possessed no catalytic activity in the oxidofreduction of 3-0~0 and 4-0~0 acids, which corroborated that the high specificity of &-crystallin is to convert oxaloacetate to malate. The biological significance of this finding remains an interesting topic for future investigation. From the consideration of different molecular sizes of side chains and the relative affinities, as reflected in different Km for 19 compounds (Tables 1 and 2), it can be deduced that &-crystallin possesses some stereochemical restraints regarding the substrate 877

By comparing the Km's for the pairs of compounds 3 and 6 plus 4 and 8, the side chain of A carbon as depicted in Fig. 3 is expected to be a small nonpolar group to get a high-affinity binding to the enzyme. By analogy, from the determined Km's of compounds4 and 12, large polar side chain of B carbon is favorable for the enzyme binding. The comparisonof Km'sfor compounds4 and 17 plus 8 and 18 led to the deduction that sidechainsof C and D carbonsof the substrates favor small and large nonpolar groupsrespectively. In summarythe sidechains of a-keto acids with good binding can contain one large hydrophilic or charge group at y-carbon which may account for the binding of oxaloacetate to a-crystallin.
