ABSTRACT: Copper amine oxidase contains a post-translationally generated quinone cofactor, topa quinone (TPQ), which mediates electron transfer from the amine substrate to molecular oxygen. The overall catalytic reaction is divided into the former reductive and the latter oxidative half-reactions based on the redox state of TPQ. In the reductive half-reaction, substrate amine reacts with the C5 carbonyl group of the oxidized TPQ, forming the substrate Schiff base (TPQssb), which is then converted to the product Schiff base (TPQpsb). During this step, an invariant Asp residue with an elevated pKa is presumed to serve as a general base accepting the R proton of the substrate. When Asp298, the putative active-site base in the recombinant enzyme from Arthrobacter globiformis, was mutated into Ala, the catalytic efficiency dropped to a level of about 106 orders of magnitude smaller than the wild-type (WT) enzyme, consistent with the essentiality of Asp298. Global analysis of the slow UV/vis spectral changes observed during the reductive half-reaction of the D298A mutant with 2-phenylethylamine provided apparent rate constants for the formation and decay of TPQssb (kobs ) 4.7 and 4.8 × 10-4 s-1, respectively), both of which are markedly smaller than those of the WT enzyme determined by rapid-scan stopped-flow analysis (kobs ) 699 and 411 s-1, respectively). Thus, Asp298 plays important roles not only in the R-proton abstraction from TPQssb but also in other steps in the reductive half-reaction. X-ray diffraction analyses of D298A crystals soaked with the substrate for 1 h and 1 week revealed the structures of TPQssb and TPQpsb, respectively, as pre-assigned by single-crystal microspectrophotometry. Consistent with the stereospecificity of R-proton abstraction, the pro-S R-proton of TPQssb to be abstracted is positioned nearly perpendicularly to the plane formed by the Schiff-base imine double bond conjugating with the quinone ring of TPQ, so that the orbitals of  and  electrons maximally overlap in the conjugate system. More intriguingly, the pro-S R proton of the substrate is released stereospecifically even in the reaction catalyzed by the base-lacking D298A mutant. On the basis of these results, we propose that the stereospecificity of R-proton abstraction is primarily determined by the conformation of TPQssb, rather than the relative geometry of TPQ and the catalytic base.

4106 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 13, 2006 cofactor named topa quinone (TPQ) that is generated posttranslationally from a specific tyrosine residue encoded in the polypeptide chain (2-6). We determined the crystal structure of a recombinant enzyme cloned from a Grampositive bacterium Arthrobacter globiformis (AGAO) at 2.2-Å resolution using the diffraction data obtained at an ambient temperature (7) and more recently at 1.8-Å resolution using those obtained at a cryo-temperature (8). The crystal structures of CAOs from pea seedling (PSAO) (9), Escherichia coli (ECAO) (10), yeast Hansenula polymorpha (HPAO) (11), Pichia pastoris (lysyl oxidase) (12), bovine serum (BSAO) (13), and most recently, human vascular membrane (a CAO that was identified as vascular adhesion protein 1 and found to be identical with semicarbazidesensitive amine oxidase) (14) have also been determined; despite rather low sequence similarities, they all have very similar polypeptide folds and active-site structures. The overall catalytic reaction of CAOs proceeds by the pingpong bi-bi mechanism and consists of the initial reductive and subsequent oxidative half-reactions, involving 2ereduction of the oxidized cofactor (TPQox) by the substrate and reoxidation of the reduced one (TPQred) by molecular oxygen, respectively. In the initial half-reaction, the amine substrate reacts with the C5 carbonyl oxygen of TPQox, yielding the substrate Schiff base (TPQssb) (15, 16), in which the pKa of the CR proton of the substrate is expected to be decreased significantly. An invariant Asp residue located close to the TPQ cofactor has been believed to serve as a catalytic base (1719), accepting the substrate CR proton to form the product Schiff base (TPQpsb) with concomitant reduction of the cofactor quinone ring (15, 16). Following hydrolysis of TPQpsb leads to the formation of the first product aldehyde and TPQred in the aminoresorcinol form (15, 16). The reductive half-reaction proceeds independently of the bound copper ion (8, 15). The latter half-reaction consists of the steps of regenerating TPQox from TPQred and involves the net 2H+ and 2e- transfers from TPQred to dioxygen, during which the copper ion plays an important role by serving as an electron mediator between TPQred and O2. This role of copper was initially proposed on the basis of the observation of the temperature-dependent, rapid equilibrium between the Cu2+/TPQred state and the Cu1+/topa semiquinone (TPQsq) state, suggesting that the latter state is kinetically competent (20, 21). However, later kinetic studies on the oxidative halfreaction have implicated that the initial 1e- reduction of O2 occurs directly from the Cu2+/TPQred couple but not from the Cu1+/TPQsq couple (22). Moreover, our metal-substitution study (8) has also suggested that the bound metal ion does not change its redox state but provides a binding site for 1e-- and 2e--reduced oxygen species to be efficiently protonated and released as a final product, H2O2. Under the turnover conditions, an iminoquinone form of TPQ (TPQimq) formed during the oxidative half-reaction may react directly with substrate amine to form TPQssb (by transimination), while TPQox is on the route in the single-turnover reaction (8). Model studies have indicated that the transimination is several orders of magnitude faster than the hydrolysis of TPQimq (16). An Asp residue strictly conserved in the active site of CAOs has been shown to be a key residue participating in the reductive half-reaction, most likely acting as a general

Chiu et al. base accepting the CR proton of the substrate in the TPQssb intermediate with an elevated pKa value (23). Asp383 of ECAO and Asp319 of HPAO correspond to this conserved Asp, and their essentiality has already been demonstrated by site-specific mutagenesis (17, 18). Further evidence has been presented that the conserved Asp participates in accepting a proton from the protonated substrate amine to facilitate TPQssb formation (24). Although a structural role in stabilizing a productive conformation of TPQ (19) and/or controlling the mobility of the TPQ ring for optimal activity (18) has also been proposed for the conserved Asp, further details of its catalytic role remain to be unraveled. In the present study herein reported, we have mutated Asp298, the Asp residue conserved in AGAO, into Ala and analyzed the catalytic properties of the D298A mutant enzyme that showed only a minuscule activity. Important new findings obtained are that (i) the pro-S R proton of the substrate is released stereospecifically regardless of the presence of the H+accepting Asp298, (ii) the TPQpsb formation including the R-proton abstraction from TPQssb is not the rate-limiting step in the reductive half-reaction of AGAO, and furthermore, (iii) X-ray crystal structures of the TPQssb and TPQpsb intermediates have been determined for the first time, revealing a conformation of TPQssb, which could further define the pro-S stereospecificity of R-proton abstraction in the AGAO catalysis (25) as an intrinsic structural feature of the catalytic intermediate. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials. Stereospecifically deuterium-labeled substrates, (R)-[1-2H]- and (S)-[1-2H]-2-phenylethylamine (2-PEA), were synthesized as described previously (25). Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from GENSET OLIGO. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available and were used without further purification. All buffers and culture media for enzyme expression were prepared with ultrapure water obtained from a NANO pureII (Barnstead). Mutant Preparation. Site-specific mutagenesis for Asp298 was carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (STRATAGENE) with a sense primer (5-AGAACTACTTCGCTACGGGGGAG-TACCTG-3) and an antisense primer (5-CAGGTACTCCCCCGTAGCGAAGTAGTTCT-3) containing mismatching bases (underlined) for the mutated codon and plasmid pEPO-02 (8) encoding the wild-type (WT) enzyme as a template. PCR was performed in a thermal cycle reactor (Perkin Elmer, GeneAmp PCR System 2400) with 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 68 °C for 10 min. An amplified DNA was treated with DpnI to digest the WT template DNA. After the digest was transformed into E. coli DH5R, an expression plasmid for D298A, pEPO-02-D298A, was isolated from a single clone. The DNA sequence of the mutant gene was confirmed with an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer; no undesired mutation was detected in the entire AGAO gene. Enzyme Expression and Purification. E. coli CD03, a mutant strain of E. coli BL21(DE3) with two catalase genes disrupted (8), carrying the expression vector pEPO-02D298A, was cultivated in a copper-depleted medium, and the D298A mutant enzyme was purified to homogeneity (purity, >99% as judged by SDS-PAGE) in the Cu2+/TPQ-

Role of Conserved Aspartic Acid Residue in CAO less apo form as described previously (4). The Cu2+/TPQcontaining holo form of D298A was prepared by dialysis of the apoenzyme against 3 L of 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 6.8 containing 50 µM CuSO4 at 4 °C for 48 h, followed by dialysis against 3 L of 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 6.8 containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 4 °C for 24 h to remove unbound or weakly bound Cu2+ ions. Similarly, the WT enzyme was also purified in the apo form and converted to the holo form. Protein concentrations were spectrophotometrically determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 12.3 and 13.2 for 1% (w/v) solutions of the apo and holo forms, respectively (4), and expressed as subunit concentrations unless otherwise stated. Rate of TPQ Formation. The rate of TPQ formation was determined spectrophotometrically in the reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM apo AGAO subunit (WT and D298A mutant) and 0.5 mM CuSO4 in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 6.8. The reaction was performed at 30 °C under atmospheric conditions, and absorption spectra were recorded every 10 s with a photodiode-array spectrophotometer. The observed rate constants (kobs) for TPQ formation were calculated by fitting the absorbance changes at 450 nm (D298A) and 480 nm (WT) plotted against time to a single exponential curve as described previously (4, 26). Determination of TPQ and Copper Contents. The reactivity of TPQ with phenylhydrazine was analyzed by incubating 5 µM holo AGAO with 20 µM phenylhydrazine prepared freshly in 500 µL of 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 6.8 and monitoring the absorbance changes at 438 nm. The firstorder rate constants for the absorbance changes were obtained by a least-squares exponential fit using Kaleidagraph version 3.0 (Abelbeck Software) on an i386-compatible PC platform. The cofactor content of the holo WT enzyme was determined by titration with phenylhydrazine as described previously (4, 8). As for D298A, the cofactor content could not be determined because of its extremely slow reaction with phenylhydrazine (see the Results). As an alternative way, assuming that the molar absorption coefficient ( M) of TPQ is the same for the WT and D298A mutant enzymes, an approximate TPQ content was estimated from the absorbance value of TPQ at each max after correction for enzyme concentrations. Copper contents were determined with a Shimadzu AA-6400G atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with a GFA-6500 graphite furnace atomizer using a commercially available copper solution (100 ppm, Nacalai Tesque) as a standard. Enzyme Assay. The enzyme activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 15 or 30 °C as indicated in 100 mM HEPES buffer at pH 6.8 with 40 µM 2-PEA as the substrate, by monitoring H2O2 production coupled to the oxidation of 2 mM 2,2-azinobis(3-ethlybenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) ( 414 ) 24.6 mM-1 cm-1) using 10 units/mL of horseradish peroxidase (Wako Pure Chemicals) (4). One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount that catalyzes the production of 1 µmol of H2O2/min under the assay conditions. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined on the basis of the ping-pong bi-bi mechanism, by systematically changing the concentration of 2-PEA with an atmospheric O2 concentration. The kinetic data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using Kaleidagraph version 3.0 (Abelbeck Software).

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 13, 2006 4107 Resonance Raman Spectroscopy. Resonance Raman scattering was excited at 514.5 nm with an Ar+ ion laser (Spectra Physics, 2017) and detected with a triple polychromator (JASCO, NR-1800) equipped with a CCD detector (Princeton Instruments). The excitation laser beam power was adjusted to 50 mW at the sample point. Measurements were carried out at room temperature in a spinning cell (3000 rpm). The data accumulation time was 600 s. Raman shifts were calibrated with acetone, and the resolution of the Raman bands was (1 cm-1. Stereochemical Analysis of Proton Abstraction. The reaction mixture (total volume of 1 mL) containing 0.014 mM D298A, 0.2 unit/mL of equine liver alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma), 0.2 mM NADH, 40 µM (R)-[1-2H]- or (S)-[1-2H]2-PEA, and 100 mM HEPES buffer at pH 6.8 was incubated at 30 °C for a total of 8 h. To keep the spontaneous oxidation of NADH as minimum as possible, 0.2 mM NADH and 40 µM 2H-labeled 2-PEA were supplemented 4 times at every 2 h during the reaction. In this system, phenylacetaldehyde (the oxidation product from 2-PEA) is immediately converted to the corresponding alcohol (2-phenylethyl alcohol) by the coupled reaction with alcohol dehydrogenase. The completed reaction mixture was extracted with 0.5 mL of ethyl acetate. An aliquot (2-4 µL) of the extracted solution was applied onto GC-MS equipment (Shimadzu GC-17A, GCMSQP5050A) to measure the mass of the alcohol. The instrumental conditions were as reported previously (25). Spectrophotometric Measurements. Spectral changes occurring during the reductive half-reaction were monitored at 15 °C using an Applied Photophysics SX.17MV rapidscan stopped-flow spectrometer with all lines and reservoir cylinders maintained under fully anaerobic conditions. Typically, equal volumes (about 30 µL each) of the enzyme solution (0.2 mM subunit for both the WT and D298A mutant in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 6.8) and the substrate solution (8 mM 2-PEA) were mixed in a mixing cell (volume of 20 µL) triggered with an N2-gas piston; the mixing dead time was generally 2.3 ms at an N2-gas pressure of 500 kPa. UV/vis absorption spectra were recorded every 2.5 ms in a wavelength region of 250-800 nm. When the slower process of the reductive half-reaction was monitored by D298A, the enzyme and substrate solutions were mixed manually using gastight syringes (final concentration, 0.14 mM subunit and 4 mM 2-PEA; final volume of 0.2 mL) in a quartz cuvette with a screw cap and the spectra were recorded at 15 °C using an Agilent 8453 photodiode-array spectrophotometer equipped with an Agilent 89090A temperature-control accessory. To avoid spectral changes associated with the oxidative half-reaction, both enzyme and substrate solutions were kept in a vacuum-type glovebox (Iuchi, SGV-65V) filled with 99.999% Ar gas for at least 6 h before the stoppedflow and manual mixing measurements and handled using gastight syringes. Spectral data were analyzed by a ProKineticist II (Applied Photophysics) software to obtain spectra of the reaction intermediates and to calculate the rate constants for each reaction step. pH Profile. To avoid inconsistencies from changing buffer components for the measured pH range from 6.0 to 10.0, buffers were prepared by mixing equal volumes of 0.2 M CHES, MOPS, and MES and titrating to the desired pH values with 1 M NaOH. The ionic strengths of buffers were maintained at 0.2 by the addition of an appropriate amount

4108 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 13, 2006 of Na2SO4 (27). For the measurement of the pH profile, the ABTS method could not be used in the acidic region because horseradish peroxidase used as a coupling enzyme was proven to be inactive below pH 6.4. Therefore, in the case of WT AGAO, a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Toko Chemical Laboratories) was used to measure the enzyme activity in terms of monitoring the rate of oxygen consumption. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.0 nM WT enzyme into the buffer at various pH (final volume of 1 mL), containing varied concentrations (2-20 µM) of 2-PEA. However, this assay method was not applicable to D298A because of the necessity of using a fairly large amount of the mutant enzyme with a very low activity. Thus, the coupling method with alcohol dehydrogenase described above for the stereochemical analysis was used to measure the activity of D298A in a broad pH range. The reaction mixture contained an appropriate amount of D298A, 0.2 mM NADH ( 340 ) 6220 M-1 cm-1), 0.2 unit/mL of alcohol dehydrogenase, and various concentrations (2.5-50 µM) of 2-PEA in the buffer at various pH (final volume of 0.4 mL), and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm because of the NADH consumption was measured at 30 °C. The kcat and kcat/Km values obtained were plotted against pH and analyzed by fitting the data to one of the following equations, where y represents the value of kcat or kcat/Km at particular pH, C is the pH-independent maximum value of the parameter [(kcat)max or (kcat/Km)max], and Ka1 and Ka2 are acid dissociation constants associated with ionizable groups on the acid and alkaline limbs, respectively, of pH profiles (28).

Chiu et al. Data Collection and Refinement. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K with the synchrotron X-radiation ( ) 1.0 Å) using a Quantum 4 detector (ADSC) in the station BL18B at Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) for free holo D298A crystals and at 100 K with the synchrotron Xradiation ( ) 0.9 Å) using a PX210 detector (Oxford) in the station BL44XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) for substratesoaked D298A crystals. The diffraction data collected for these crystals were processed and scaled using MOSFLM (29) and SCALA (30), respectively. These crystals were found to belong to the space group I2 as reported for the WT AGAO crystals at a cryo temperature (8). The details and statistics of data collection are summarized in Table 1. The program used for refinements, calculation of electrondensity maps, and assignment of solvent molecules was CNS version 1.1 (31). Manual rebuilding was performed using an xfit module in the XtalView software package (32). The WT structure (PDB code 1IU7) without solvent molecules was used as an initial model, with TPQ382 being replaced with an unmodified Tyr residue. After subjecting to the rigidbody refinement, initial structures of the free and substratesoaked holo D298A crystals were further refined through simulated annealing from 3000 K and several cycles of B-factor and positional refinements. In the modeling stage, the residues at the mutated sites were replaced with an Ala residue based on the Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc electron-density maps. The models of the substrate Schiff-base complexes (TPQssb and TPQpsb) were built using Insight II (Accelrys, CA), and then topology and parameter files for refinement used for CNS were generated with XPLO2D in the X-UTIL package (33). Residues at position 382 of the holo D298A and the two substrate-soaked structures were replaced by the oxidized form of TPQ, TPQssb, and TPQpsb, respectively, on the basis of the 2Fo - Fc, Fo - Fc, and omit maps. Metal ions were assigned on the basis of the highest peaks in the respective 2Fo - Fc maps; water molecules and residues in the active-site region were carefully examined using 2Fo Fc, Fo - Fc, and omit maps. These models were refined through further several cycles of B-factor and positional refinements after introducing solvent molecules. The details and statistics of crystallographic refinement are also summarized in Table 1. RESULTS TPQ Generation in the D298A Mutant. Several fundamental properties of the D298A mutant enzyme purified in the apo form and then dialyzed against CuSO4-containing buffer for cofactor generation are summarized in Table 2, together with those of the WT enzyme for a comparison. The copper content in D298A was estimated to be about 0.9 mol/mol of subunit, which is similar to the content in the WT enzyme, indicating that the copper-binding ability was minimally affected by the mutation of Asp298 to Ala. An absorption spectrum of D298A (Figure 1A) also suggested that the TPQ cofactor was correctly generated in D298A, as in the WT enzyme. However, an attempt to determine the TPQ content by spectrophotometric titration with phenylhydrazine (34) was unsuccessful because of the extremely slow reaction of the D298A mutant with phenylhydrazine (kobsWT/kobsD298A ) 170, see Table 2), as reported for the analogous catalytic base mutants of HPAO (18) and ECAO (19). Therefore, assuming that the molar absorption

Crystallization and Single-Crystal Microspectrophotometry. The holo D298A was crystallized by the microdialysis method as described previously (8). The enzyme solution (10 mg/mL) was placed in a 50-µL button and dialyzed at 16 °C against 1.05 M potassium-sodium tartrate in 25 mM HEPES buffer at pH 6.8. Single crystals with approximate dimensions of 0.2 × 0.4 × 0.1 mm grew in about 2 weeks, and then the dialysis buttons were transferred into the new reservoir solution supplemented with 45% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant. For determination of the crystal structures of the TPQssb and TPQpsb intermediates generated in the active site, the holo D298A crystals were further soaked at 16 °C for 1 h to 1 week in the new reservoir solution containing 45% (v/v) glycerol and 3 mM 2-PEA. Before exposure to X-ray, the crystals were analyzed by singlecrystal microspectrophotometry at 100 K. The microspectrophotometer system consisted of a deuterium tungsten halogen light (Ocean Optics, DT-MINI), Cassegrainian mirrors (Bunkoh-Keiki Co. Ltd.), an optical fiber, and a linear CCD-array spectrometer (Ocean Optics, SD2000). Absorption spectra were recorded in the wavelength region of 178879 nm and corrected for the air blank baseline and dark reference.

coefficient of TPQ is the same for both of the WT and mutant enzymes ( MTPQ(WT) ) 1800 M-1 cm-1) (35), the TPQ content in D298A was estimated from the absorbance value at 460 nm (max of TPQ in D298A, see below). An approximate TPQ content in D298A thus estimated was 0.61 mol/mol of subunit, which was comparable to the content in the WT enzyme determined by titration with phenylhydrazine (Table 2). Semiquantitative detection of quinone groups with the alkaline nitroblue tetrazolium/glycinate reagent developed for quinone staining (36) also revealed no obvious difference in the TPQ contents of D298A and WT AGAO (data not shown). Thus, Asp298 is not directly involved in the copper-dependent self-processing generation of TPQ, although the rate of TPQ generation is reduced to about 40% of the WT by the mutation (Table 2), the reason for which remains unsettled. Absorption and Resonance Raman Spectra. We noted that the D298A solution was colored yellowish brown after dialysis against the TPQ-generating buffer containing CuSO4. Indeed, a UV/vis absorption spectrum of holo D298A has revealed that max of TPQ (around 460 nm) is blue-shifted by about 26 nm as compared with the WT TPQ, which is colored pink with max at 486 nm (Figure 1A). A similar blue shift of TPQ absorption has been reported for the equivalent holo D383A mutant of ECAO (36 nm blue shift) (19), indicating that the TPQ ring  electrons are more localized in the mutant enzyme lacking the nearby Asp residue than in the WT enzyme.

Resonance Raman spectra of the holo D298A and WT AGAO have also revealed that the Raman band at a wavenumber of 1685 cm-1 in the WT spectrum, which had been assigned to the CdO stretch of the C5 carbonyl group of TPQ (37), is upshifted by 9 cm-1 in the D298A spectrum (Figure 1B). This indicates that the C5dO group of TPQ has a greater double-bond character in D298A than in the WT enzyme. In contrast, the band at 1579 cm-1, assigned to the CdO stretch of the C2 carbonyl group of TPQ (37), is downshifted by 6 cm-1 in D298A, which indicates that the C2dO group of TPQ has a more single-bond character in D298A than in the WT enzyme. Other vibrational modes, particularly in the lower energy field (1100-1500 cm-1), correspond well with each other in peak frequencies and intensities. In combination with the 26 nm blue shift of max in the UV/vis absorption spectrum, these results demonstrate that the TPQ ring  electrons are more uniformly delocalized in the WT enzyme than in the D298A mutant, in which electrons on the C5dO carbonyl group are less conjugating with the ring -electron system. Thus, although there is no direct interaction between TPQ and Asp298 in the activesite structure of WT AGAO (8) (see Figure 6C), the electronic properties of TPQ are significantly affected by the presence of the presumed catalytic base, Asp298. In the HEPES buffer at pH 6.8 used for spectral measurements, the side-chain carboxyl group of Asp298 would be dominantly protonated because of its elevated pKa value (7.5, see below) and thereby could form a weak hydrogen bond

Chiu et al. of the conserved Asp residue with other amino acid residues (except for Glu) resulted in the complete disappearance of catalytic activities, even though TPQ was normally generated. Presumably, such a low activity as found in the D298A mutant of AGAO is detectable only by using a very large amount of the purified enzyme. Steady-state kinetic parameters determined for D298A indicated that the Km value for 2-PEA is comparable with that of the WT enzyme, while the kcat values determined at 30 °C are different by 105folds between the WT and D298A mutant (Table 2), revealing that the decrease of the catalytic activity of D298A is derived mostly from the marked drop in the kcat value. Effect of pH on Steady-State Kinetic Parameters. Steadystate kinetic parameters of the WT and D298A mutant enzymes were determined under various pH conditions, and the values of log(kcat) and log(kcat/Km) for 2-PEA were plotted against pH (Figure 2). The plot of log(kcat/Km) for 2-PEA versus pH of the WT enzyme was bell-shaped, giving pKa values of 7.5 ( 0.2 for a group on the acid limb and 8.7 ( 0.2 for a group on the alkaline limb by fitting the data to eq 1 (Figure 2A). The ionizing group on the acid limb must be deprotonated, and the ionizing group on the alkaline limb must be protonated in the free state before catalysis. On the basis of equivalent assignments made by Farnum et al. on BSAO (23), Hevel et al. on HPAO (39), and Murray et al. on ECAO (19), the former group with a pKa of 7.5 is assigned to the side-chain carboxyl group of Asp298, which must be deprotonated for the reaction to occur. The latter ionizing group with a pKa of 8.7 may be assigned to the amino group of the substrate, which interacts with the enzyme in its protonated form. For the D298A mutant, only a single ionizable group was observed on the acid limb with a pKa of 6.8 ( 0.1 (Figure 2B), which is too low to be attributed to a primary amino group [pKa reported for 2-PEA ) 9.78 (40)]. Although the group with this low pKa value remains to be assigned, the similar pH dependence has been observed in the reaction of tranylcypromine with an active-site mutant of ECAO, in which the pKa was not determined but estimated to be less than 6 (24). The pH-independent values of (kcat/Km)max were estimated to be (5.5 ( 1.5) × 107 and 57.1 ( 5.8 M-1 s-1 for WT and D298A, respectively, again showing that the mutation of Asp298 to Ala resulted in an about 106-fold decrease of the catalytic efficiency. The plot of log(kcat) versus pH of the WT enzyme was also bell-shaped, giving pKa values of 6.5 ( 0.1 and 8.8 ( 0.1 (Figure 2C). Thus, the pKa of the carboxyl group of Asp298 decreases by about 1 pH unit in the enzyme/substrate complex, and it must be ionized for the subsequent reaction to occur, most likely for accepting the R-H+ from the TPQssb intermediate. The curve of log(kcat) versus pH plot of the D298A mutant declined in the region above pH 8.5 (Figure 2D), giving an apparent pKa of 9.9 ( 0.2. This group as well as the high pKa group (8.8) in the WT enzyme should be protonated in the enzyme/substrate complex, but their assignments warrant further studies. Stereospecificity of R-Proton Abstraction. We have recently reported that the pro-S CR proton of the amine substrate is released stereospecifically during the reaction catalyzed by WT AGAO (25). To investigate whether the stereospecificity for R-H+ release is associated with the presence of the putative H+ acceptor (Asp298), we have determined the stereospecificity of the R-H+ abstraction by

FIGURE 1: UV/vis absorption and resonance Raman spectra.

with the C5dO group in the WT enzyme (3.5 Å) (8), leading to partial electron withdrawal from the C5dO double bond. Another possible cause for the blue shift of max of TPQ is that there is a water molecule (Wat1) hydrogen-bonding to the C4-O- group of TPQ in D298A, which is absent in the WT enzyme as described later for X-ray crystal structures (Figure 6C). This hydrogen bond would increase the single bond character of the C2dO group that is conjugating with the C4-O- group (38). It is also likely that the absence of Asp298 and the presence of Wat1 both contribute simultaneously to the blue shift of max of TPQ. Catalytic Properties. The D298A mutant enzyme exhibited almost no enzymatic activity when measured under the standard assay conditions. However, careful measurements using a very large amount (>1 mg) of the purified D298A have revealed that it does possess an extremely low activity, estimated to be 105-106 orders of magnitude smaller than the WT activity (Table 2). This minuscule activity of D298A is due to neither experimental errors nor the contamination of the WT enzyme, because the purified D298A mutant showed completely no activity before activation in the TPQgenerating buffer. This result contrasts with those of previous mutagenesis studies (17-19, 24), in which the replacement

the D298A mutant using stereospecifically deuterium-labeled substrates, (R)-[1-2H]- and (S)-[1-2H]-2-PEA. Because the product aldehyde may lose the aldehyde hydrogen (1H or 2 H) by auto-oxidation to the corresponding carboxylic acid during a very long period (8 h) needed for the reaction of D298A, possessing only a very low activity, the aldehyde produced was simultaneously converted to the corresponding stable alcohol by the coupled reaction with alcohol dehydrogenase in the presence of NADH. The alcohol was extracted with ethyl acetate, and an aliquot (5-10 µL) of the extract was directly analyzed by GC-MS. The amounts of the deuterium-labeled amines and alcohols were rectified on the basis of the relative intensities of the concomitant M - 1 and M + 1 peaks observed for the nonlabeled amines and alcohols. As summarized in Table 3, both of the alcohols (2-phenylethyl alcohol) obtained in the oxidation of nonlabeled 2-PEA and (S)-[1-2H]-2-PEA had a molecular ion peak at 122 Da in the mass spectrum, indicating the loss of the deuterium label during the oxidative deamination of (S)[1-2H]-2-PEA by D298A. On the other hand, when (R)[1-2H]-2-PEA was used, the alcohol had a mass of 123 Da, indicating retention of the deuterium label. The stereoselectivity was calculated to be >99% from the mass spectra of the alcohols obtained from both [2H]-labeled substrates (Table 3). Therefore, it is concluded that the oxidation of 2-PEA by the D298A mutant proceeds in a strictly stereospecific manner, exclusively releasing the pro-S hydrogen at the CR position of substrate amine, as determined for the

WT AGAO (25). Thus, the stereospecificity for R-H+ abstraction is completely preserved, regardless of the presence of the H+-accepting base, Asp298. Spectral Changes ObserVed during the ReductiVe HalfReaction. To identify the reaction step(s) accounting for the markedly decreased catalytic activity of the D298A mutant, UV/vis spectral changes initiated by the addition of a substrate have been measured under the single-turnover (anaerobic) conditions. Such spectral changes are expected to provide a convenient clue to identifying TPQ-related intermediates formed during the reductive half-reaction of CAOs (41, 42). A rapid-scan stopped-flow spectrometer was used to monitor the initial fast reactions of the D298A mutant and WT enzymes, whereas a conventional spectrometer was used to follow the subsequent slow phase of the D298A reaction started by manual mixing. All measurements were done at 15 °C, so that kinetic constants for both very rapid and extremely slow reactions of WT and D298A, respectively, could be directly compared. Upon anaerobic mixing of the WT enzyme with excess substrate (2-PEA), the 486-nm absorption band of TPQox disappeared within the dead time (2.3 ms) of the stoppedflow instrument (Figure 3A). At nearly the same time, an absorption peak at 316 nm and a shoulder band around 410 nm appeared and then decayed concomitantly with the emergence of new peaks at 365, 438, and 465 nm (inset in Figure 3A), which were assigned to TPQsq (8, 43). No isosbestic points were observed in the initial five spectra

Chiu et al. spectra of TPQox, TPQssb, TPQpsb, TPQred, and TPQsq; the inset shows the time courses of concentration changes of these intermediates. The absorption spectrum obtained for TPQssb with a strong shoulder band around 350 nm and a broad and weak one above 400 nm resembles that of a model compound in a nonpolar (CH2Cl2) or polar (CH3CN) aprotic solvent (16). Moreover, the spectrum obtained for TPQpsb with a broad peak at 408 nm differs considerably from that of a neutral form of a model compound with a max at 368 nm in acetonitrile but resembles that of a monoprotonated form with a max at 406 nm (see intermediate G in Scheme 2) (16). The calculated spectrum for TPQsq with absorption peaks at 360, 438, and 467 nm agrees well with those obtained experimentally by anaerobic reduction of AGAO with the substrate (8, 43). Pre-steady-state kinetic constants estimated from the most converged solution in the global analysis (inset in Figure 3B) are summarized in Table 4, together with the steady-state kcat value of the overall reaction determined at 15 °C for a comparison. The k+4 value is the smallest among the four rate constants in the forward direction, showing that this step (TPQred f TPQsq) is ratelimiting in the single-turnover (anaerobic) reductive halfreaction of AGAO. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the rate of the TPQpsb hydrolysis step (k+3; TPQpsb f TPQred) is less than half that of the proton abstraction step (k+2; TPQssb f TPQpsb), showing that the hydrolysis of TPQpsb is second rate-limiting in the reductive half-reaction of AGAO. An anaerobic reaction of the D298A mutant with 2-PEA also resulted in the spectral changes of TPQ, which consisted of the initial relatively fast and subsequent slow phases. In the initial fast phase monitored by stopped-flow spectroscopy, the TPQ-derived 460-nm absorption band decreased slightly and, concomitantly, a new band at 310 nm appeared within 750 ms (inset in Figure 4A). These spectra intersected at about 400 and 540 nm, suggesting that TPQox is converted into a single species in this fast phase. The species that formed first is most likely assigned to TPQssb, assuming that the reaction pathway of the D298 mutant is essentially identical with that of the WT enzyme. Hence, the multiwavelength data acquired were fit by global analysis only to the initial step of TPQox f TPQssb (Scheme 1), where the absorption spectrum of D298A TPQox was fixed as a starting state and that of TPQssb and the rate constants were set variable. The calculated UV/vis spectrum of TPQssb (Figure 4C) has a weak shoulder band in the 310-340 nm region and a broad peak at about 450 nm. This spectrum differs considerably from that of TPQssb formed in the WT enzyme (Figure 3B) but is similar to that of a model compound in a polar protic solvent (CH3OH) (16). On the basis of the studies using model compounds (16), TPQssb with a max at around 350 nm in the WT enzyme and that with a max at around 450 nm in D298A may be assigned to the zwitter ionic and anionic structures, respectively, and an about 100-nm red shift in the latter is presumably due to the resonance delocalization of the negative charge. The rate constant, k+1, calculated from the time courses of the concentration changes (Figure 4D) is also listed in Table 4. Although the initial phase completes within 1 s even with the D298A mutant, the k+1 value is about 150-folds smaller than that of the WT enzyme, indicating that Asp298 participates also in the TPQssb formation (see the Discussion).

(within 11 ms) but were found at 382 and 429 nm in the four spectra thereafter, suggesting that at least two intermediates are involved in the later phase of the reductive halfreaction. According to the well-accepted mechanism of the reductive half-reaction, TPQox, TPQssb, TPQpsb, TPQred, and TPQsq should be formed in this order and TPQsq is the final species under the anaerobic conditions (20). The multiwavelength data of spectral changes acquired were therefore fit to the four-step model (Scheme 1) by global analysis, where the absorption spectrum of the apo AGAO was used as that of TPQred, assuming that TPQred exhibits no absorption above 300 nm (38). Also, the absorption spectra of TPQox and TPQred were fixed in the data fitting, while the spectra of other species and rate constants at all steps were varied. Shown in Figure 3B are the deconvoluted UV/vis absorption

The subsequent slow phase of the D298A reaction was started by manual mixing and monitored with an ordinary spectrometer (Figure 4B). At an initial point of data acquisition that usually took several seconds after starting the reaction by manual mixing, most parts of TPQox were already converted to TPQssb, consistent with the rate constant obtained by a stopped-flow measurement (k+1 ) 4.7 s-1, Table 4). However, the following spectral changes were extremely slow, taking several hours, and appeared to involve only two detectable species. Because TPQred should be invisible in the region above 300 nm, it is suggested that the hydrolysis step (TPQpsb f TPQred) is relatively fast as compared with the very slow steps of TPQssb f TPQpsb and TPQred f TPQsq, and therefore, TPQpsb does not accumulate during the reaction. Hence, the multiwavelength data of spectral changes observed during the slow phase of the D298A reaction were approximated to the three-step model without TPQpsb (Scheme 1; TPQssb f TPQred, k+2) and fit to this model by global analysis, where the spectra of TPQssb and TPQred were fixed and other parameters were set variable. The resultant absorption spectrum of TPQsq and time courses of the concentration changes of TPQssb, TPQred, and TPQsq, all of which converged nicely in the calculation, are shown in parts C and D of Figure 4, and the rate constants (k+2 and k+4) estimated thereof are listed in Table 4. The

calculated spectrum of TPQsq roughly coincides with that of TPQsq formed in the WT enzyme (see Figure 3B) in the spectral shape and max values, unlike those of TPQox and TPQssb, whose electronic state is affected by the nearby presence of the negatively charged residue Asp298, as described above for the UV/vis absorption spectrum of TPQox. The rate of disappearance of TPQssb (k+2 ) 4.8 × 10-4 s-1) is very small and in the same order of magnitude with the steady-state kcat value (1.2 × 10-4 s-1) determined at 15 °C for the overall catalytic reaction, suggesting that the step of TPQssb f TPQpsb, which includes the release of R-H+, is probably rate-limiting in the reductive half-reaction of D298A, and it is therefore concluded that Asp298 plays the most important role in this step. It is noteworthy that the intramolecular electron-transfer step, TPQred f TPQsq, is also considerably slower in the D298A reaction than in the WT reaction. Collectively, Asp298 participates not only directly in the RH+-abstraction step (TPQssb f TPQpsb) but also indirectly in other steps, including those of TPQox f TPQssb and TPQred f TPQsq. Furthermore, the equilibrium between the TPQred/Cu2+ and TPQsq/Cu1+ couples shifts toward the latter in the WT reaction (k+4/k-4 ) 3.3), whereas it shifts toward the former in the D298A reaction (k+4/k-4 ) 0.3).

a minuscule activity was further utilized for structure determination of reaction intermediates, in particular X-ray crystal structures of TPQssb and TPQpsb, formed with a true amine substrate, which have not been reported thusfar; the catalytic reaction of D298A was expected to proceed very slowly and coordinately within the crystals. Thus, the crystals of the D298A mutant of AGAO were soaked with the substrate (3 mM 2-PEA) for short (1 h) and long periods (1 week); these crystals are referred to hereafter as D298A/2PEA(h) and D298A/2-PEA(w), respectively. The substratesoaked crystals were then subjected to single-crystal microspectrophotometric analysis at 100 K before exposure to X-rays for spectral identification of reaction intermediates formed, if any, in the crystals. Because the raw spectra of individual crystals showed different absorption intensities because of the difference in crystal thickness, the spectra were mathematically adjusted to have the same absorbance at about 400 nm, corresponding to the isosbestic point observed for the spectral changes of D298A in solution upon the addition of the substrate (see Figure 4A). The crystals of D298A/2-PEA(h) exhibited a UV/vis spectrum distinct from that of the substrate-free D298A crystals (Figure 5A) and resembling that of a reaction intermediate of D298A in solution assigned to TPQssb (cf. Figure 4C). This clearly

shows that the amine oxidation reaction that proceeded in the crystals and the TPQssb intermediate was successfully freeze-trapped after 1 h of crystal soaking with the substrate. On the other hand, the crystals of D298A/2-PEA(w) showed a spectrum different from those of the substrate-free D298A and D298A/2-PEA(h) crystals (Figure 5B) but rather similar to the TPQpsb intermediate formed in the WT enzyme in solution (cf. Figure 3B). Although TPQpsb has not been observed in the reductive half-reaction of D298A in solution presumably because of the relatively fast hydrolysis step (TPQpsb f TPQred) as compared with the adjacent steps as described above, the hydrolysis step may be even slow in crystals likely because of the restricted movement of water molecules within the hydrophobic active site (see below), so that the TPQpsb intermediate accumulates in a long period (1 week) of substrate soaking. Structures of three AGAO derivatives, the substrate-free D298A mutant and those complexed with the substrate, were determined by X-ray crystallography. The refined structures of free D298A, D298A/2-PEA(h), and D298A/2-PEA(w) gave R factors of 19.1, 17.7, and 20.2% and Rfree of 20.1, 20.1, and 23.2%, respectively (Table 1). The overall structures of free D298A, D298A/2-PEA(h), and D298A/2-PEA(w) are essentially the same as that of the WT AGAO (PDB

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 13, 2006 4115 of the TPQ ring (Figure 6A). The TPQ ring in the D298A structure was tilted upward at the C5-C6 edge, with the ring angle of 21° relative to that of the WT. In addition, the electron density in the 2Fo - Fc map was lower around the C5-C6 edge of the TPQ ring than the other part of the ring (data not shown). In reference to this observation, it has been reported for ECAO that the TPQ ring is located in a wedge-shaped pocket and the TPQ ring carbons at the substrate-binding position (C5-C6) have some freedom of movement than other ring carbons at C1-C4 (19). The tilting-up of the TPQ ring in the D298A mutant of AGAO might have resulted from the removal of the Asp298 carboxyl group that could anchor the TPQ ring through a weak hydrogen bond to the C5 carbonyl oxygen atom of TPQ, as described earlier. Another conspicuous difference is the orientation of the side chain of Tyr296, rotating by 104° around its CR-C bond and invading into the space created by the removal of the Asp298 side chain and tilting-up of the TPQ ring (Figure 6A). Furthermore, a water molecule (Wat1) that is absent in the WT structure is present close to the TPQ O4 in the space evacuated by the conformational change of Tyr296 (Figure 6C). Wat1 is strongly hydrogenbonding to the TPQ O4 atom (2.6 Å) and the O atom of the Gln294 side chain (2.7 Å). As described below, Wat1 is maintained also in the TPQssb and TPQpsb structures, forming a hydrogen-bonding network in the three D298A structures distinct from the WT structure. These structural differences may lead to differences in electronic features of TPQ described above for the UV/vis and resonance Raman spectra of the WT and D298A mutant enzymes. The structures of D298A/2-PEA(h) and D298A/2-PEA(w) have also been refined on the basis of the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps and also the Fo - Fc omit map. The maps clearly exhibited extra electron densities connected to the C5 position of TPQ even in the initial stage of the structural

The coordinates of the side chain of TPQssb were taken from the crystal structure of D298A/2-PEA(h). The -carbon atom was changed to a methyl group, and hydrogen atoms were attached as described for the structure E in Scheme 2. Optimization of the structure with fixing the non-hydrogen atoms was carried out with Gaussian 98 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. A single-point calculation was performed at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p) level, and the molecular orbital was visualized using ChemBats3D (version 9.0.1, CambridgeSoft) at a contour level of (0.020.

refinement, suggesting the presence of a covalently linked substrate. After the pre-assignments made by single-crystal microspectrophotometry, chemical structures of TPQssb and TPQpsb were modeled into the Fo - Fc omit maps obtained for D298A/2-PEA(h) and D298A/2-PEA(w), respectively. Although the present diffraction data at 1.85-Å resolution were insufficient for judging the bond lengths (i.e., to identify the position of the CdN imine double bond in TPQssb and TPQpsb), the omit maps accommodated well the chemical structures of TPQssb and TPQpsb (parts A and C of Figure 7, respectively). To further verify the validity of the introduced models, the models were refined in a reverse manner, with the omit maps of D298A/2-PEA(h) and D298A/2-PEA(w) being calculated using the TPQpsb and TPQssb models, respectively. However, the refinements were unsatisfactory in this case; for example, the C atom of TPQpsb was not fitted well within the electron density of D298A/2-PEA(h). Moreover, when the shapes of electron densities, particularly the portions extending from the TPQ ring, were compared, that of D298A/2-PEA(h) appeared to bent at the position corresponding to the CR atom of the substrate (Figure 7B), whereas that of D298A/2-PEA(w) appeared to bent at the position corresponding to the C atom of the substrate (Figure 7D). In the TPQssb and TPQpsb models, in which the CR atoms have sp3 and sp2 configurations, respectively, the C atom of only TPQpsb can be placed in the same plane of the conjugating TPQ ring and the imine double bond (see the N-CR-C bond angles shown in parts E and F of Figure 7). Hence, the shapes of electron densities also led us to assign the electron densities in the D298A/2-PEA(h) and D298A/2-PEA(w) structures to TPQssb and TPQpsb, respec-

tively. Altogether, we conclude that the structures of D298A/ 2-PEA(h) and D298A/2-PEA(w) represent the TPQssb and TPQpsb intermediates, respectively. This assignment is also consistent with the soaking period (i.e., forming first TPQssb and then TPQpsb, according to the reaction sequence). Although the crystal structures of CAOs complexed with inhibitors have been reported previously (17, 44, 45), those of catalytic intermediates, TPQssb and TPQpsb formed in the crystals by the use of a true amine substrate, have been determined for the first time in the present studies. As shown in Figure 6A, the active-site structures of D298A/2-PEA(h) and D298A/2-PEA(w), except for the substrate moieties, are essentially identical with the substratefree D298A structure, including the side-chain flipping of Tyr296 and the presence of Wat1. The distal part of the substrate (benzene ring) in TPQssb and TPQpsb is bound in a hydrophobic pocket constituted by the side chains of Phe105, Ala135, Pro136, Leu137, Trp168, Tyr302, Tyr307, Ile379, Phe407, Leu358, and Trp359 (Figure 6B), among which the last two residues are provided from a large loop (Arm I) (7) of the other subunit of the dimer. In the substrate-free WT and D298A structures, six and two water molecules are contained in this pocket, respectively, while no water is contained in the TPQssb and TPQpsb structures, with the substrate benzene ring replacing them. Most of the residues constituting the hydrophobic pocket kept the same conformation before and after the substrate binding, but the side chains of Leu358, Tyr302, and Phe105 slightly moved toward the direction of closing the pocket, likely attaining the tight binding of the substrate benzene ring (Figure 6B).

Role of Conserved Aspartic Acid Residue in CAO Although hydrogen atoms are invisible at the present 1.8-Å resolution, their coordinates, particularly those connected to carbon atoms, can be automatically generated by a computer. The two prochiral R-hydrogen atoms of the substrate were thus generated in the final model of TPQssb (Figure 7A). It is evident that the pro-S hydrogen is positioned more perpendicularly to the plane of the Schiff-base/TPQ ring -electron system than the pro-R hydrogen and also is oriented toward Ala298 (Asp298 in the WT enzyme). This orientation of the pro-S hydrogen is fully consistent with the stereospecificity of the R-proton abstraction described above. DISCUSSION Proposed Mechanism of the ReductiVe Half-Reaction. On the basis of the results obtained thus far and also the comprehensive description for the catalytic mechanism of CAOs presented by Mure et al. (15), a detailed mechanism of the reductive half-reaction of AGAO is proposed as shown in Scheme 2. As inferred from the effect of pH on the steadystate kinetic parameters, the amino group of the substrate [pKa of 2-PEA ) 9.78 (40)] is protonated at neutral pH and the positively charged substrate is thereby facilitated to enter the active site through the negatively charged, funnel-shaped channel (7, 46) (step A f B). In the Michaelis complex (B), the substrate amino group must be deprotonated to attack the C5dO carbonyl group of TPQox as a nucleophile (15) (step B f C). On the other hand, the carboxyl group of Asp298 that should be deprotonated before substrate binding may be protonated in this stage, likely accepting a proton from the substrate amino group (24). To undergo facile protonation at neutral pH, the conserved Asp residue commonly possesses an unusually high pKa value [7.5 for Asp298 of AGAO (this study), 8.1 for Asp319 of HPAO (39), and 8.0 for Asp385 of BSAO (13, 23)], which is most likely attained by charge repulsion with the C4 oxoanion of TPQox (15) (see below) together with the hydrophobic environment of the active site (47). The protonated carboxylate of Asp298 would then serve as a general acid, providing a proton back to the hydroxyl group of the carbinolamine intermediate (C) to assist dehydration (steps C f D f E). Consistent with the participation of Asp298 in these initial steps (particularly in the dehydration step), the observed rate of TPQssb formation in the D298A mutant enzyme (k+1 ) 4.7 s-1, Table 4) is about 150-fold smaller than that (699 s-1) of the WT enzyme. This also explains the very low reactivity of the D298A mutant toward phenylhydrazine (kobsWT/kobsD298A ) 170, Table 2); the reaction with phenylhydrazine also involves a dehydration step prior to the hydrazone formation (48). The hydrazino amino group of phenylhydrazine has a pKa of 5.25 (49), and therefore, its deprotonation at neutral pH needs little assistance by Asp298, supporting the greater contribution of Asp298 to the dehydration from the carbinolamine (steps C f D f E) than to the initial deprotonation of the substrate amino group (step A f B). Hence, the first intermediate observed by the presteady-state kinetic analysis is TPQssb, with the substrate amino nitrogen atom attached to the C5 carbon of TPQ in an imine double bond, and the carboxylate of Asp298 is deprotonated again (E). The twitter ionic structure of TPQssb is stabilized by a strong electrostatic interaction of the C4

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 13, 2006 4117 oxoanion of TPQ with the protonated imine nitrogen of the neighboring Schiff base (16). Although the exact pKa values of the R hydrogen of amines are not known, the value would not be so much different from the value of the hydrogen of tetramethylammonium [pKa ) 42 (50)] and would be much higher than 20. Therefore, because it is almost undissociable in the physiological pH region, the Schiff-base formation with the substrate amino group is regarded to be a very important function of the TPQ cofactor, lowering the pKa of the R-hydrogen atom to a dissociable level. Such a function is also common to pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) that was erroneously believed to be the elusive cofactor of CAOs until the early 1980's (51). In the initial step of the PLP-dependent enzyme reactions with the R-amino acid as a general substrate, the R-hydrogen atom of amino acids, which has pKa values of >20 (52), must be removed by the -amino group of the Lys residue involved in the binding of PLP, which has a pKa value of 10.5. In aspartate aminotransferase, the pKa value of the substrate R-hydrogen atom is estimated to be decreased to around 13, as calculated from the equilibrium constant (102) (53) between the substratePLP Schiff base (Lys unprotonated) and its deprotonated structure (Lys protonated). Similarly, the pKa of the R-hydrogen atom of the amine substrate in TPQssb should be sufficiently lowered enough to be released slowly even without the proton-abstracting base in the D298A mutant. Once TPQssb is formed, the carboxyl group of Asp298 with a decreased pKa of 6.5 (see above) would then act as a general base, effectively abstracting a proton from TPQssb (step E f F). Although this step is not rate-limiting in the reductive half-reaction of WT AGAO (k+2 > k+3, Table 4), the R-proton abstraction from TPQssb is the most important catalytic role of Asp298, as manifested in the largest drop of the rate constant for this step by the Asp298-to-Ala mutation (k+2WT/k+2D298A ) 106). Concomitant with the stereospecific abstraction of the pro-S R-H+ of the substrate in the TPQssb intermediate by the deprotonated carboxylate of Asp298, the C2dO oxygen atom of TPQ may accept a proton from a water molecule that is hydrogen-bonding to it (step E f F). This water is stabilized by coordination to the bound Cu2+ ion and would easily donate a proton (pKa ) 7.5) (54). The resultant TPQpsb is formally a 2e--reduced form of TPQ, in which electrons are derived from the substrate amine. Although the C4 hydroxyl group of TPQox has a very low pKa [4.1 in a model compound (38) and 3 in BSAO (38) and AGAO (55)], the same group in TPQpsb is likely to have a high pKa of about 9 because of the reduced TPQ ring (F) (38). Thus, the C4 oxoanion easily accepts a proton from the protonated carboxyl group of Asp298 (step F f G), which originates from the substrate CR position. Protonation of the C4 oxygen then leads to the reduced stability of TPQpsb that arises from a loss of electrostatic stabilization between the C4 oxoanion and the Schiff-base imine nitrogen (G) (15). Although TPQpsb was not observed in the reaction of D298A, likely because of a faster rate of disappearance than that of formation and, therefore, the rate constant for TPQpsb hydrolysis could not be compared between the WT and D298A reactions, Asp298 may also participate in the hydrolysis of TPQpsb by raising the basicity of the water molecule attacking the imine carbon atom (step H f I). Finally, the aminoresorcinol form of TPQred (J) is

FIGURE 8: Modeling of an alternative conformation of TPQssb. An alternative conformation of TPQssb was manually modeled by rotating around the N-CR bond of TPQssb obtained in the X-ray crystal structure, so that the pro-R R-hydrogen atom is positioned perpendicularly to the Schiff-base/TPQ plane. Stereodiagram of active-site residues of the D298A mutant is shown in a stick representation (red). Asp298 of the WT enzyme is also shown (orange). The two prochiral hydrogen atoms (pro-S and pro-R) in the two conformations are indicated by arrows.

formed concomitantly with the release of the product aldehyde (steps I f J f K). The Cu2+-coordinating hydroxide ion may be reprotonated indirectly by the protonated carboxyl group of Asp298 through the hydrogenbonding network conserved in the active site (see Figure 6C). In the single-turnover reductive half-reaction of AGAO under anaerobic conditions, the spectroscopically observed final form of TPQ is TPQsq (Figure 3A), resulting from a single electron transfer from TPQred to the bound Cu2+ ion (step K f L). This intramolecular electron-transfer step, TPQred f TPQsq, is the slowest step, with a rate constant (k+4) being only twice the overall kcat value, (Table 4) and hence appears to be off the overall reaction cycle, as reported previously (8, 22). However, TPQsq has been proposed to be a kinetically competent intermediate in the catalysis of CAOs, on the basis of the observation for the temperaturedependent, rapid equilibrium between Cu2+/TPQred and Cu1+/ TPQsq (20, 21). In relation to this argument, we have recently determined the crystal structure of AGAO anaerobically reduced with the substrate and found that TPQred (or TPQsq) is in a catalytically inactive "on-copper" conformation (7) with the C4-O- atom of TPQ positioned at a distance of 2.7 Å from the bound copper ion (Okajima, T., unpublished data) (see Scheme 2, L). Thus, it is likely that the slow step of TPQred f TPQsq (k+4) determined from the pre-steadystate kinetics reflects the conformational change of TPQred from the catalytically active "off-copper" conformation to the inactive on-copper one, in which the intramolecular electron transfer from TPQred to Cu2+ would certainly occur very rapidly. Implications for Stereospecificity of R-Proton Abstraction. The stereospecificity of proton abstraction from the CR position of the substrate has been studied for CAOs from various organisms (17, 56, 57). Interestingly, the stereospecificity is variable depending upon the enzyme sources and substrate amines used. For example, the pro-S proton of dopamine is abstracted in the reaction of PSAO, while the pro-R proton of the same amine is abstracted in the reaction of porcine plasma enzyme (57). On the other hand, BSAO is nonstereospecific for dopamine but is pro-S-specific for another substrate, benzylamine (56, 57). We have recently shown that AGAO stereospecifically abstracts the pro-S R-H+ of 2-PEA (25), similar to plant and other bacterial

CAOs (17, 57). In view of the highly conserved active-site structures of this enzyme family (7-14), the origin of the inconsistent stereospecificity remains to be settled. The wider and deeper funnel-shaped substrate channel of BSAO than that of other CAOs (13) may correlate with its broad substrate specificity and the stereochemical ambiguity. For AGAO, it is very important to note that the pro-S stereospecificity is maintained even in the absence of the catalytic base (Asp298), as described above. This observation strongly suggests that the stereospecificity of R-H+ abstraction is not simply determined by the relative geometry of TPQ and the R-proton-abstracting catalytic base. To gain further insight into the stereospecificity of R-proton abstraction, the two prochiral R-hydrogen atoms were generated in the final model of TPQssb (Figure 7A). Consistent with the stereospecificity of AGAO, the pro-S hydrogen indeed directs toward Ala298 (Asp298 in the WT enzyme) and is located closer to Ala298 than the pro-R hydrogen. More importantly, however, in this conformation of TPQssb, the pro-S hydrogen is positioned nearly perpendicularly to the plane of the Schiff base/TPQ ring, so that the  orbital of the CR-HS bond maximally overlaps with the  orbital of TPQssb. Preferential -bond cleavage by such maximal orbital overlap was originally hypothesized by Dunathan for PLP-dependent enzyme reactions, in which one of the three  bonds cleaved around the CR atom of the amino acid substrate should be oriented perpendicularly to the Schiff-base/PLP plane (58). Furthermore, when the molecular orbitals of TPQssb were calculated by a DFT method (B3LYP) using Gaussian 98 (59) and the coordinates of TPQssb were obtained in this study, LUMO of the pro-S hydrogen atom was found to be more widely and densely protruding into the space than that of the pro-R hydrogen atom (Figure 7G), suggesting that the LUMO of the pro-S hydrogen is highly advantageous for the interaction with the HOMO of a proton acceptor, the deprotonated carboxylate oxygen atom of Asp298 in the WT enzyme or an oxygen atom of a nearby water molecule in the D298A mutant. Altogether, these results lead to a new proposal that the stereospecificity of R-proton abstraction is primarily determined by the conformation of TPQssb, rather than the relative geometry of TPQ and the catalytic base.

Role of Conserved Aspartic Acid Residue in CAO If the stereospecificity of R-proton abstraction is indeed determined by the conformation of TPQssb, the active-site structure of each CAO, particularly the local region that binds a distal part of the amine substrate (the opposite end of the amino group), should be taken into account, because the conformation of TPQssb is allowed to vary by the rotation around the N-CR and CR-C bonds (see Figure 7E) but is fixed upon binding of the distal part of substrate (benzene ring in the case of 2-PEA) to the enzyme active site. Residues constituting the hydrophobic pocket for binding of the benzene ring of 2-PEA in AGAO (Figure 6B) are only poorly conserved. Thus, it is strongly suggested that the inconsistent stereospecificity of R-proton abstraction among various CAOs arises from the difference in the structures of the substrate-binding pocket that ultimately controls the conformation of TPQssb. To examine this hypothesis, the conformation of TPQssb has been manually modeled in the active site of AGAO, so that the pro-R R-hydrogen atom is positioned perpendicularly to the Schiff-base/TPQ plane by rotating around the N-CR bond (Figure 8). In this conformation, the distance to the carboxyl group of Asp298 (modeled into the D298A structure) is also 1.7-Å shorter for the pro-R hydrogen atom than for the pro-S hydrogen. However, significant steric hindrances are evoked between the activesite residues and the benzene ring or other parts of the substrate, for example, the C6 H atom of the TPQ ring versus the C atom of 2-PEA and the side-chain methyl group of Ile379 versus the benzene ring H atoms of 2-PEA. Therefore, this conformation of TPQssb with the perpendicularly positioned pro-R hydrogen atom is not allowed in practice for AGAO with 2-PEA as the substrate. Nevertheless, a smaller amine such as ethylamine may be able to take alternative conformations of TPQssb. Indeed, a preliminary experiment with stereospecifically [2H]-labeled ethylamine as the substrate has shown a notable decrease (to as low as 88%) of the pro-S stereospecificity for R-proton abstraction by AGAO (Yamamoto, Y., unpublished data). In conclusion, the present study unequivocally demonstrates that Asp298 of AGAO, corresponding to the Asp residue strictly conserved in the active site of CAOs, functions as a general acid/base catalyst participating not only in the R-proton abstracting step but also in other steps involving proton transfer during the reductive half-reaction of the catalytic cycle. More intriguingly, the stereospecificity for R-proton abstraction is inherently determined by the conformation of the TPQssb intermediate, rather than the relative geometry of TPQ and the catalytic base.
