Avidin enhances the hydrolysis of biotinyl p-nitrophenyl ester (BNP) under mild alkaline conditions, whereas streptavidin prevents hydrolysis of BNP up to pH 12. Recently, we imposed hydrolytic activity on streptavidin by rational mutagenesis, based on the molecular elements responsible for the hydrolysis by avidin. Three mutants were designed, whereby the desired features, the distinctive L124R point mutation (M1), the L3,4 loop replacement (M2), and the combined mutation (M3), were transferred from avidin to streptavidin. The crystal structures of the mutants, in complex with biotinyl p-nitroanilide (BNA), the stable amide analogue of BNP, were determined. The results demonstrate that the point mutation alone has little effect on hydrolysis, and BNA exhibits a conformation similar to that of streptavidin. Substitution of a lengthier L3,4 loop (from avidin to streptavidin), resulted in an open conformation, thus exposing the ligand to solvent. Moreover, the amide bond of BNA was flipped relative to that of the streptavidin and M1 complexes, thus deflecting the nitro group toward Lys-121. Consequently, the leaving group potential of the nitrophenyl group of BNP is increased, and M2 hydrolyzes BNP at pH values >8.5. To better emulate the hydrolytic potential of avidin, M3 was required. The combination of loop replacement and point mutation served to further increase the leaving group potential by interaction of the nitro group with Arg-124 and Lys-121. The information derived from this study may provide insight into the design of enzymes and transfer of desired properties among homologous proteins.

hicken avidin and bacterial streptavidin are indispensable proteins for extensive types of biotechnological application. Avidin is found in egg whites of reptiles, amphibians, and birds, whereas streptavidin is found in the bacterium Streptomyces avidinii. The two proteins share many biochemical and structural features (1, 2), the foremost characteristic being that both bind biotin with extremely high affinity, representing the strongest noncovalent interaction known in nature (3). Although the two proteins share only 30% identity and 40% similarity in their sequence, their tertiary fold is highly similar: tetramers comprising four identical subunits, each of which contains a single biotin-binding site. The tertiary fold of avidin and streptavidin consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel -barrel, and the main difference between the two protein lies in the size, composition, and conformation of the loops connecting the strands (4­6). The hairpin loop connecting strands 3 and 4 (the L3,4 loop) in both proteins plays an important role in biotin binding (7). In avidin, the loop is three residues larger than that of streptavidin. In the apoproteins, L3,4 in both avidin and streptavidin has an open or disordered conformation. Upon binding biotin, the loop closes in a lid-like manner, thus burying the ligand almost completely. The latter similarities are offset by relatively subtle differences in the two proteins. One striking difference between avidin and streptavidin is the ability to hydrolyze biotinyl ester derivatives. In this context, avidin has been shown to enhance the hydrolysis of biotinyl p-nitrophenyl ester (BNP) in a ``pseudoenzymatic'' process (7); in contrast, streptavidin protects BNP from hydrolysis even under conditions of very high pH.

data have revealed that the L3,4 loop plays a crucial role in this phenomenon. As a result of the three extra residues, the avidin loop exhibits high flexibility in complexes with extended biotin derivatives, such as the chemically stable biotinyl p-nitroanilide (BNA) analog of the labile BNP. In contrast the shorter loop in streptavidin maintains a closed ``consensus'' conformation (7, 8). Consequently, when BNA is bound to avidin, the L3,4 loop is partially disordered, thus exposing the ligand to solvent (7). The disordered state of the loop in avidin permits a flip in conformation of the BNA amide bond and subsequent reorientation of the ligand toward interaction with Lys-111 from an adjacent monomer. In avidin, Lys-111 was found to play a direct role in the hydrolysis of BNP. Interaction between the nitro group of BNP and the lysine would thus promote the hydrolysis of BNP. In addition, Arg-114 of avidin would appear to repel the ligand to assume a conformation that promotes its interaction with Lys111. In streptavidin, however, the homologous position is occupied by a smaller residue, Leu-124, and BNP fails to interact with the homologous lysine, Lys-121. In a previous study, we examined whether the hydrolytic properties of avidin can be transferred to streptavidin by sitedirected mutagenesis. Three mutants of streptavidin were constructed, to elucidate the structural elements, which confer the catalytic protective properties of avidin and streptavidin (9). Mutant M1 was constructed by point mutation to yield L124R. Mutant M2 was designed wherein loop L3,4 was exchanged with the corresponding loop from avidin. The third mutant, M3, was a combination of both the point mutation and loop exchange. The results indicated that the conferment of hydrolytic activity was directly influenced by loop replacement and lesser so by the point mutation. However, the combined mutation resulted in a streptavidin derivative that exhibited hydrolytic activity comparable with that of avidin (9). In the current study we have elucidated the three-dimensional structures of the three mutants in complex with BNA (the amide analogue of BNP). The structures of the complexes provide insights into the differences in the pseudocatalytic activity of the streptavidin mutations. Moreover, the structures confirm and extend our understanding of the structural features that contribute to the mechanism of avidin-induced hydrolysis and streptavidin-mediated protection of BNP. Materials and Methods and M3 were expressed and purified according to the previously described protocol (9). The complexes between the streptavidin mutants and BNA were prepared by introducing several grains of the biotinyl derivative into a 2.2­4.2 mg ml solution of the desired mutant. The solubility of BNA in aqueous solutions is

Shown are stereoviews of Fo Fc electron-density maps calculated at respective resolutions indicated in Table 1, after the initial cycle of refinement with no ligand in the model.

Comparative Structural Analysis of the Mutant­BNA Complexes with Those of Native Avidin and Streptavidin. The tertiary and quater-

nary structures of the three streptavidin mutants are quite similar to those described for wild-type streptavidin, where the tetrameric assembly consists of a dimer of dimers (20). As observed for both the avidin and streptavidin tetramers, a conserved tryptophan residue from an adjacent monomer is donated to the biotin-binding site (Trp-110 in avidin and Trp-120 in streptavidin, located in the L7,8 loop connecting strands 7 and 8). These tryptophans of the respective proteins were shown to have a major contribution both to the binding of biotin and to the stability of the tetrameric assembly (21­24). In the M1­BNA complex (i.e., the L124R point mutation), the presence of Arg-124 generates a somewhat surprising structural effect: rather than shifting the p-nitroanilide moiety toward Lys-121 of the adjacent monomer, as observed for the avidin­ BNA complex, it is instead positioned in the opposite direction, such that the mutated residue interacts with one of the nitro oxygens, thus forming H-bonding interactions (2.9 and 3.6 Å) with N 1 and N 2 of Arg-124 (Fig. 2A and Table 2). The L3,4 loop adopts a closed lid-like conformation, thus rendering the BNA ligand almost inaccessible to solvent, similar to that observed in the native streptavidin complexes with BNA and biotin (6, 7). In contrast, the L3,4 loop of the apo-M1 structure is in an open conformation and partially disordered (unpublished data), similar to the apo structures of native streptavidin and avidin. In M2, the L3,4 loop of streptavidin was replaced with that of avidin, thus yielding a loop three residues longer than that of the native protein. In the M2­BNA complex, the p-nitroanilide moiety thus assumes a conformation resembling that observed for the avidin­BNA complex. In this context, the amide bond of

Fig. 2. Structural comparison of avidin, streptavidin, and M1, M2, and M3, complexed with BNA. (A) Superposition of streptavidin and M1 complexes. The structures illustrate that in the M1 complex (cyan), BNA maintains a similar conformation as in the streptavidin complex (magenta). In the M1­BNA complex, the p-nitroanilide group is shifted away from Lys-121 of the adjacent monomer, such that one of its nitro oxygens forms two H-bond interactions with the mutated Arg-124. The L3,4 loop in the M1­BNA complex adopts a closed conformation, similar to that of the streptavidin complex with minor deviations because of the shift of the p-nitroanilide moiety. Figs. 2 and 3 were constructed by using MIDAS (30). (B) Superposition of avidin, streptavidin, and M1, M2, and M3 complexes with BNA. The complexes can be classified into two main groups, based on the relative conformation of the p-nitroanilide group of BNA. In the avidin (yellow), M2 (red), and M3 (blue) complexes, wherein the L3,4 loop adopts an open or disordered conformation, the amide bond is flipped, thus resulting in a shift in the plane of the p-nitroanilide group relative to those of the streptavidin (magenta) and M1 (cyan) complexes. The flip of the amide bond allows one of the nitro oxygen atoms to attain a position that facilitates interaction with the Lys-111 (avidin) or Lys-121 (M2 and M3) from an adjacent monomer. This interaction is suggested to be one of the major driving forces of the hydrolytic reaction. (C) Stereoview of the superposition of avidin, M2, and M3 complexes with BNA. The open L3,4 loop and the subsequent flip of the amide bond brings the nitro group of BNA into close proximity with the designated lysine of the adjacent monomer. In M3 (blue), the mutated Arg-124 is shifted toward one of the nitro group oxygens to form two H-bond interactions. The three combined H-bonding interactions of the nitro group in the M3­BNA complex may reflect its high hydrolytic activity relative to the M2 (red) complex, wherein only one H-bond interaction is formed. In avidin (yellow), Arg-114 is relatively distant from the nitro group and thus fails to interact with BNA.

the ligand is flipped with respect to the corresponding BNA complexes with M1 and native streptavidin (Fig. 2B). Consequently, as in the avidin complex but unlike the complexes of M1 and streptavidin, the carbonyl oxygen establishes an H-bond interaction (2.78 Å) with Ser-88 O (Table 2). The flip in the amide bond results in a shift of the p-nitroanilide group toward the adjacent M2 monomer, and an interaction (3.82 Å) between one of the nitro oxygens is generated with the Lys-121 N (Table 2). Moreover, the L3,4 loop of the M2-BNA complex is completely disordered, lacking residues 47­51 and 47­50 in monomers 1 and 2, respectively, thus exposing the carbonyl carbon of the amide bond to solvent. By analogy, upon binding of BNP (the
Eisenberg-Domovich et al.

substrate of the pseudoenzymatic reaction) to M2, we propose that the flipped conformation of the carbonyl carbon of the ester would facilitate nucleophilic attack under relatively mild alkaline conditions. M3 comprises the combination of the two above-described modifications of the streptavidin molecule; namely, the L124R point mutation of M1 together with the L3,4 loop substitution of M2. In the M3­BNA complex, the conformation of the BNA molecule closely emulates that observed in the avidin­BNA complex. Thus, the p-nitroanilide moiety of the M3­BNA complex is directed toward the adjacent monomer even closer than that observed in M2­BNA (Fig. 2 B and C and Table 2). As in

the M2 complex, the carbonyl oxygen of the M3-complexed BNA amide bond has been flipped (relative to the complexes with M1 and native streptavidin) and is directed toward Ser-88 O to form an H-bond interaction (2.82 Å) (Table 2). Moreover, one of the nitro oxygens forms a close interaction with Lys-121 N (2.65 Å). In fact, the bond formed is even tighter than those of the complexes with M2 (3.82 Å) and native avidin (2.92 Å). The other nitro oxygen interacts with Arg-124 N 1 and N 2 (3.12 Å and 3.48 Å, respectively) (Table 2). The Arg-124 side chain of M3 also undergoes a conformational change relative to that of M1, which still permits establishment of the interaction with the nitro group of BNA. In both M2 and M3, there is a conserved water molecule, which forms an H-bond interaction with the BNA amide nitrogen (3.01 Å and 3.49 Å, respectively). However, in both cases, the water molecule is too distant (more than 4 Å) from the carbonyl carbon to implicate its involvement in nucleophilic attack on the ester bond. Finally, the L3,4 loop adopts a completely open conformation (Fig. 3), thus exposing the amide bond of BNA to solvent (note: in the second subunit of the asymmetric unit, the L3,4 loop is partially disordered and two residues are lacking in the model). Discussion One of the differences between chicken egg-white avidin and bacterial streptavidin is the contrasting characteristic whereby

avidin promotes the hydrolysis of BNP, whereas streptavidin protects it from hydrolysis. Based on observed structural differences between the avidin and streptavidin complexes with BNA (a stable analogue of BNP), a series of mutations were suggested, which were designed to confer hydrolytic properties onto streptavidin (7). Through these means, the factors that determine the differences in hydrolytic activities of appropriate mutants, in comparison with native avidin and streptavidin, were corroborated biochemically (9). In M1, the presence of arginine at position 124 instead of the native leucine causes a shift in the p-nitrophenyl moiety to assume a conformation that results in relatively low hydrolytic activities at pH values 10 (Fig. 4). The observed activity is in general somewhat higher than streptavidin, probably because of the H-bonding interaction formed between partially charged Arg-124 and the nitro group of BNA (Fig. 2; Table 2). However, the observed shift in the substrate is insufficient to change the conformation of the complex to emulate that of native avidin. The interaction with Arg-124 serves to increase the leavinggroup potential of the p-nitrophenyl moiety, but the biotin derivative is almost completely buried in the binding site of M1. The ligand is thus unavailable to solvent, because of the closed conformation of the L3,4 loop. As a consequence, BNP is protected from nucleophilic attack by external water molecules. Nevertheless, because of the strong H bond between Arg-124 and the nitro group of BNA, the residual water molecules that remain in the vicinity of the binding site are apparently sufficient to promote relatively low levels of hydrolysis under conditions of alkaline pH. The L3,4 loop in the native streptavidin­BNA complex is also in the closed conformation, thus blocking access of the confined p-nitrophenyl moiety from Lys-121 of the

In streptavidin, the loop is in the closed conformation, thus burying the BNA ligand almost completely. In M3, where the loop has three more residues, L3,4 adopts an open conformation. Note the flipping of the amide bond of the ligand and the altered conformation of the p-nitroanilide group.

adjacent monomer. Consequently, the hydrolytic activity of streptavidin increases only at pH values 10. Compared with M1, M2 shows significantly higher hydrolytic activity (Fig. 4). The increased activity of M2 can be attributed mainly to the disordered L3,4 loop, thus allowing the BNP molecule to attain a position in relatively close proximity to Lys-121 of the adjacent monomer. The consequent exposure of the ester bond, coupled with the interaction of the p-nitrophenyl moiety with Lys-121, increases the hydrolytic potential. M3, which combines the mutations of both M1 and M2, exhibits a further increase in activity. M3 reaches maximal hydrolytic activity at pH values ranging from 7.5 to 8.0, in a manner even more pronounced than that of native avidin itself. An additional factor may, in fact, enhance the leaving group potential of the p-nitrophenyl moiety of the ligand: Arg-124 forms an H-bond interaction with the ligand, and its presence would serve to shift the nitro group toward Lys-121. The resultant conformation of the p-nitrophenyl group is now permitted by the disordered nature of the L3,4 loop. In turn, the latter group forms a tighter interaction than that observed in the other complexes. M3 shows a somewhat higher activity than avidin at pH values between 8.0 and 8.5, which may reflect the combined interaction of the BNP nitro group with Lys-121 and Arg-124. It is well known that catalytic elements in an active site have to be exactly positioned to carry out their function. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the hydrolytic function could be transferred between two structurally related proteins. The results also imply not only that catalytic elements have to be precisely positioned to efficiently cleave the biotin derivative but also that the status of residues in relatively remote regions of the protein may play an important role. The criteria for effective performance of a protein include the size and structure of critical

loops and the movement or repositioning of a key residue or groups of residues. Such alterations, which may also be influenced by the binding or positioning of the substrate, may directly affect the propensity for catalysis. We have shown that we can transfer the property of hydrolytic activity by mutagenesis (i.e., alteration and or insertion of key residues) between homologous proteins, e.g., egg-white avidin and bacterial streptavidin. By analogy, it may also be possible to transfer similar types of activities among structurally related superfamilies of proteins, which generally retain common folds and persistently conserved positions (25, 26). In this context, the ``humanization'' of mouse monoclonal antibodies is an example where binding properties were transferred from mouse to human antibodies (27, 28). The hydrolytic activity of avidin was imposed onto streptavidin. However, because of the tenacious binding between the protein and biotin, this activity represents but a single cycle and has thus been considered as pseudoenzymatic activity. We could not induce turnover even though streptavidin has an affinity for biotin somewhat lower than that of avidin. To convert avidin and streptavidin to ``authentic'' enzymes, we will have to introduce appropriate substrate turnover characteristics. It seems that to achieve this goal, we will have to randomly mutate residues in the biotin-binding site or transfer the catalytic site of biotinidase to avidin or streptavidin. Alternatively, we can modify the substrate, as we have shown previously by using 2-(4 -hydroxyphenylazo)benzoic acid (HABA)-based derivatives, whereby low levels of turnover were observed (29).
