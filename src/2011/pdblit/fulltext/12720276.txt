In spite of the belonging to the same c-type lysozyme family, hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) was much less susceptible to the dual-affinity labeling with 2',3'-epoxypropyl b-glycoside of N-acetyllactosamine (Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo) than human lysozyme (HL). The three-dimensional structures of the HEWL labeled with single Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo and the Glu102-mutant HL labeled with double Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo were ° determined by X-ray crystallography at resolutions of 1.85 and 2.0 A, respectively. The overall conformation and the interaction mode of the carbohydrate ligand part in the singly labeled HEWL and the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL were basically identical to those of the correspondingly labeled wild-type HL with minor alterations in some stereochemical parameters. A detailed comparison of the structures revealed the key protein­carbohydrate and carbohydrate­carbohydrate interactions essential for the dual labeling. It was suggested that the difference in the efficiency of the dual labeling was caused by the structural difference between Gln104 in HL and Asn103 in HEWL. The relevance to our previous study and the carbohydrate­carbohydrate interaction on cell-surface membranes were discussed. Copyright # 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Much important information on the catalytic reaction mechanism has been obtained using irreversible inhibitors possessing the affinity for the active site of enzymes including glycoside hydrolases (Legler, 1990; Plapp, 1982). In particular, provided the affinity labeling is employed in conjunction with X-ray crystallography, it can significantly contribute to new insights into the substrate recognition mechanism at the atomic level and pave the way to an improved molecular design of the function. However, to date, only a few cases, in which the three-dimensional structure of the modified enzyme was determined at high resolution, have been reported with regard to glycosidases (Keitel et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1995; Havukainen et al., 1996). The modified human lysozyme (HL) that uncovered the origin of its carbohydrate-recognition specificity has

also constituted part of the limited examples (Muraki et al., 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000a). C-type lysozymes including HL and hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) are a family of bacteriolytic enzymes of vertebrate origin. The enzymes generally show a strong affinity for the oligosaccharide composed of multiple N-acetylglucosamine residues linked to b1,4-glycosidic linkages, such as N,N'-diacetylchitobiose (GlcNAcb1,4GlcNAc; Thomas et al., 1969). C-type lysozymes exhibit much weaker affinity for N-acetyllactosamine (Galb1,4GlcNAc) compared with GlcNAcb1,4GlcNAc, which was exemplified by the inferiority of Galb1,4GlcNAc to GlcNAcb1,4GlcNAc in the inhibition of the bacteriolytic activity of HL (Muraki et al., 1996). Nevertheless, in addition to the 2',3'-epoxypropyl b-glycoside of GlcNAcb1,4GlcNAc (GlcNAcb1,4GlcNAc-Epo), the corresponding derivative of N-acetyllactosamine (Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo) has been successfully applied to label the active site of HL (Muraki et al., 1996). To our surprise, not GlcNAcb1,4GlcNAc-Epo but Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo further reacted with the enzymatically inactive singly modified HL to give the doubly modified HL, and the second labeling was considered to occur by way of first ligand-assisted recognition of the second ligand (Muraki et al., 1999). This phenomenon is interesting from the view point of functional design of a protein, because the result suggested the possibility of creating a novel carbohydrate-binding protein without catalytic activity (a lectin) which shows the

recognition specificity different from the major specificity of the original protein using the pre-conjugation of a saccharide moiety. The crystallographic analysis of the singly modified wild-type HL (Muraki et al., 1996) and the doubly modified wild-type HL (Muraki et al., 1999) revealed the important contribution of the side-chain groups of Asp 102 and Gln 104 in wild-type HL as the protein part to the specific hydrogen-bonding interactions with the ligand part. The previous study also gave a reasonable account on the mechanism of the sequential attachment of a couple of Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo molecules to the catalytic carboxylate groups of Glu35 and Asp53 in the active site of wild-type HL (Muraki et al., 1999). In the present study, the affinity-labeling of two different c-type lysozymes was investigated. The dual labeling was also observed with Glu102-mutant HL and a significant amount of the doubly labeled protein comparable to that of wild-type HL was produced. On the other hand, the chromatogram of the reaction mixture under the same condition showed the insusceptibility of HEWL, which possesses Asn103 at the corresponding position of Gln104 in HL, to the dual labeling as compared with HL. In order to clarify the cause of the difference in the dual labeling efficiency, we determined the structures of the HEWL and the Glu102-mutant HL labeled with Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo singly and doubly, respectively. The comparison of them with the structures of the correspondingly labeled wild-type HLs provided the advanced understanding of the ligand-recognition mechanism in the dual-affinity labeling of c-type lysozyme with Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo.

lyophilized to use in the crystallization experiments. Crystallization and structure determination The singly labeled HEWL was crystallized according to the described method using 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and sodium chloride as the buffer and the precipitant, respectively (Ducruix and Giege, 1992). The micro-seeding ´ method using native HEWL crystals worked well to give the prisms with the dimensions of 0.3 Â 0.4 Â 0.4 mm, and the diffraction data was collected on an Enraf-Nonius FAST diffractometer using the Cu Ka radiation produced by FR571 generator (40 kV, 50 mA). Crystallization of the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL was performed as described previously for the corresponding derivative of wild-type HL (Muraki et al., 1999). Only small prisms with the maximum dimension of 0.1 mm were obtained and the data collection was performed at the device of Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) using the synchrotoron radiation ° of wavelength of 1.0 A. A software package, X-PLOR ver. 3.1 (Brunger, 1992) was used to solve the structures by ¨ molecular replacement. The refined coordinates of wildtype HEWL (PDB code: 1RFP; Motoshima et al., 1997) and that of the Glu102-mutant HL labeled with single Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo (PDB code: 1D6Q; Muraki et al., 2000a) were used as search models. The number of protein molecules in the asymmetric unit was estimated to be one ° for both cases as judged by the Vm value (2.37 A3 DaÀ1 for the HEWL labeled with single Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo and ° 1.80 A3 DaÀ1 for the Glu102-mutant HL labeled with double Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo). The cross-rotation search ° using 15.0­4.0 A data indicated that there was no necessity for the rotation and the translation of the search model for the modified Glu102-mutant HL model. However, 40 steps of rigid-body refinement were required to reduce the Rfactor from 0.490 to 0.318 for wild-type HEWL model before entering into the `prepstage' of simulated annealing procedure. After the first round of `slowcooling' protocol from 3000 K, the R-factor dropped to 0.258 and 0.265 for the HEWL model and the Glu102-mutant HL model, respectively. The examination of the (Fo­Fc) and (2Fo­Fc) difference electron-density maps allowed the inclusion of the ligand parts lacked in the initial models using TURBOFRODO (Roussel et al., 1990). Water molecules which could form at least one hydrogen bond with a protein atom, a ligand atom or an already existing water molecule were included. After the inclusion of all ligand parts and water molecules into the models, 10% of the observed data was set aside for cross-validation analysis. The procedure comprising the simulated annealing and the individual temperaturefactor refinement reduced the R-factor and the R free of the singly labeled HEWL model and the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL model to 0.192 (R-factor)/0.258 (R free) and 0.195 (R-factor)/0.274 (R free), respectively. Some further refinement steps including the addition of the newly found water molecules were performed to obtain the final models. The coordinate error was estimated to be less than ° 0.25 A from Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) for both cases. All stereochemical parameters of the final model checked by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) were either within or better than the average value ranges obtained from good

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Preparation of the affinity-labeled lysozymes Hen egg-white lysozyme (six times crystallized) was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. and used without further purification. The purified Glu102-mutant human lysozyme was obtained according to the procedure described previously (Muraki et al., 2000a). All chemical reagents including the affinity labeling reagent, 2',3'-epoxyproply b-glycoside of N-acetyllactosamine (Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo), were as described previously (Muraki et al., 1996). The reaction of HEWL and Glu102-mutant HL with the affinity labeling reagent was performed by incubating either HEWL (21 mg) or Glu102-mutant HL (15 mg) with the affinity labeling reagent (25 mg) in 1.1 ml of 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4) at 37 °C for 24 h. At this point, a few percent of residual bacteriolytic activity was still observed for both samples. The same affinity labeling reagent (25 mg) was added into the reaction mixture and further incubated for 48 h at 37 °C to complete the reaction. No detectable bacteriolytic activity remained. The reaction mixture was separated by a cation-exchange chromatography using MonoS HR column (Amersham Bioscience) for purification. Molecular weights were checked by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis (Voyager, Perseptive Biosystems) for peak fractions to identify the labeled products. The peak fractions containing the desired products were pooled and dialyzed against 0.15 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) at 4°C, then

RESULTS
Affinity labeling of c-type lysozymes Both c-type lysozymes were treated under the same conditions with excess Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo (final concentration, 103 mM) until no residual bacteriolytic activity was detected. Figure 1 shows the cation exchange HPLC elution profile of the final reaction mixture with regard to HEWL and Glu102-mutant HL. In both cases, a MALDI-TOF/MS analysis identified peak a and peak b as the singly labeled product and the doubly labeled product, respectively. With

regard to HEWL, the measured molecular weight of peak a and peak b was 14 747 and 15 183, which was in good agreement with the theoretical value of 14 746 and 15 185, respectively. The corresponding values about Glu102mutant HL were 15 159 and 15 595 (measured), and 15 146 and 15 586 (theoretical), respectively. The overall elution profile of the reaction mixture of HEWL resembled that of wild-type HL, however the production ratio of the doubly labeled HEWL (peak b) to the singly labeled HEWL (peak a) was much lower than that in the case of wild-type HL (Muraki et al., 1999). The elution profile of the reaction mixture of Glu102-mutant HL was essentially the same as that of wild-type HL. The peak-area ratio (peak a/peak b) in the labeling of HEWL was 4.0, which was much larger than 1.9 in the case of Glu102-mutant HL. On the other hand, the relative amount of the uncharacterized reaction product (peak c) preceding the singly labeled product (peak a) to the doubly labeled product (peak b) was much larger for HEWL compared with Glu102-mutant HL. The peak-area ratios (peak c/peak b) were 1.8 and 0.60 for HEWL and Glu102mutant HL, respectively. Also, the previous study (Muraki

et al., 1999) showed that no peak of the dual-labeled product was detected with regard to HEWL under the less rigorous reaction condition using a lower Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo concentration (6.6 mM), which already produced the peak of the dual-labeled wild-type HL. These results together indicated that HEWL was much less susceptible to the dual affinity labeling than HL. In addition, preliminary labeling experiments of another c-type lysozyme, turkey egg-white lysozyme (Gly101 and Asn103), under similar reaction conditions to those employed in the present study showed the same characteristics as HEWL (unpublished work). Structure of the affinity-labeled lysozyme The three-dimensional structures of the HEWL singly labeled with Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo and the Glu102-mutant HL doubly labeled with Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo were determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Plate 1 shows the (Fo­Fc) omit difference electron-density maps for the ligand part. The average temperature factor of the ligand part in the singly labeled HEWL and the first ligand part in the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL was nearly the same as that of the protein part (Table 1). This suggested that the carbohydrate moiety of these ligand parts formed the surface of a new cleft structure to accommodate the second ligand by sticking to the active site of the original protein (Plate 2). As compared to the clearly defined electrondensity for the ligand part of the singly labeled HEWL and the first ligand part of the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL, the electron-density for the second ligand part of the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL was less defined (Plate 1), suggesting the conformational fluctuation of the second ligand part in the binding site. The possible large fluctuation of the more solvent-exposed second ligand part was considered to be mainly ascribed to the rather weak affinity between the first ligand part and the second ligand part in

solution. The average temperature factor of the second ligand part was approximately three times larger than that of the first ligand part (Table 1). Figure 2 shows the ligand binding structures of the singly labeled HEWL and the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL. The overall conformation of the ligand part in the binding site was basically identical to that of the corresponding part of the singly labeled wild-type HL and the doubly labeled wild-type HL, respectively. This suggested that the general recognition mechanism of the first ligand was common to HEWL and HL, and that the first ligand assisted recognition of the second ligand observed for wild-type HL occurred again for Glu102-mutant HL. All pyranose rings in the ligand part took a normal chair conformation. In Table 2, several stereochemical parameters of the N-acetyllactosamine moiety were summarized. The parameter values of the N-acetyllactosamine moiety in the singly labeled HEWL showed fair similarity to those of the N-acetyllactosamine moiety in the singly labeled wild-type HL with the minor alteration of C6­O6 bond conformation of the N-acetylglucosamine residue toward the C5­O5 bond from gauche to Àgauche. The side-chain indole ring of Trp62 in HEWL shared the same plane with the side-chain phenol ring of Tyr63 of HL and the parallel stacking geometry of these residues to the galactose residue was almost perfectly maintained [Fig. 3(a)]. The conformation of the N-acetyllactosamine moiety of the first ligand part in the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL closely resembled the conformation of the corresponding part in the doubly labeled wild-type HL except for the alteration of C6­O6 bond conformation of the N-acetylglucosamine residue toward the C5­O5 bond from nearly cis to gauche (Table 2). On the other hand, the stereochemical parameters, the torsion angles (f and ) and the helical twist parameter ( H), of the N-acetyllactosamine moiety of the second ligand part in the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL were significantly different from those of the wild-type HL counterpart (Table

(a) The singly labeled HEWL (thick lines) and the singly labeled HL (thin lines); (b) the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL (thick lines) and the doubly labeled wild-type HL (thin lines). Concerning the ligand part, only the galactose residue is included. GAL1 and GAL2 refer to the galactose residue in the ®rst ligand part and the galactose residue in the second ligand part, respectively.

Comparison of the protein­ligand and ligand­ligand interactions In the singly labeled HEWL, a number of hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions between the ligand part and the protein part were present as observed in the singly labeled wild-type HL. In Fig. 4, the hydrogen-bonding network around the ligand part is compared with each other. The number of possible hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the galactose residue including the water-bridged ones decreased from seven in HL to four in HEWL. Regardless of the change in the location of the carboxylate group [Fig. 3(a)], the direct hydrogen bond between axial 4-OH group of the galactose residue and the side-chain group of Asp (Asp101 in HEWL and Asp102 in HL) was maintained (Fig. 4), suggesting the key role of this interaction in the recognition of the galactose residue by c-type lysozyme. The corresponding hydrogen bonding interactions to the water-mediated ones involving Gln104 of wild-type HL [Fig. 4(b)] was not possible in the case of HEWL [Fig. 4(a)] due to the shorter length and the different orientation of the side-chain group of Asn 103 [Fig. 3(a)]. The interactions involving the N-acetylglucosamine residue were common to both lysozymes except for the additional one between Ne-H group of Trp62 in HEWL and 6-OH group of the N-acetylglucosamine residue [Fig. 4(a)]. This interaction explained the preference of Àgauche conformaCopyright # 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

tion of C6­O6 bond of the N-acetylglucosamine residue toward the C5­O5 bond in the singly labeled HEWL (Table 2). In HL, the main-chain carbonyl group of the corresponding residue, Tyr63, was hydrogen-bonded to 6-OH group of the galactose residue [Fig. 4(b)]. Figure 5 shows the comparison of the possible hydrogenbonding network around the ligand part in the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL and the doubly labeled wildtype HL. As was the case in the doubly labeled wild-type HL, the network was composed of many protein­carbohydrate and carbohydrate­carbohydrate interactions in the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL. In either instance, Gln104 residue played a key role in bridging the two N-acetyllactosamine moieties by forming several direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds. Among the direct hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the side-chain group of Gln104, the interaction with the glycosidic oxygen atom of the first ligand part was maintained, however the counterpart was changed from 2-OH group of the galactose residue to 6-OH group of the N-acetylglucosamine residue in one of the interactions with the second ligand (Fig. 5) due to the relocation of both the Gln104 side-chain group and the galactose residue in the second ligand part [Fig. 3(b)]. Despite the mutation of Asp102 to Glu, the direct hydrogen bond to axial 4-OH group of the galactose residue in the first ligand part was maintained (Fig. 5) by managing the position of the side-chain carboxylate group of Glu102 to

almost the same place as that of Asp102 in the doubly labeled wild-type HL existed (Fig. 3b). Tables 3 and 4 summarizes the calculated solventaccessible surface area (Fraczkiewicz and Brawn, 1998) of the protein and carbohydrate parts in the affinity-labeled lysozymes. Asp102/Glu102 and Gln104, the key residues of the protein part in the protein­ligand hydrogen-bonding interactions concerning the singly labeled wild-type and Glu102-mutant HLs, were significantly less exposed to solvent as compared with the corresponding residues, Asp101 and Asn103, in the singly labeled HEWL. The possible hydrogen bonds toward the second ligand involving these residues in the singly labeled HLs can be stabler compared with the corresponding hydrogen bonds in the singly labeled HEWL in solution, because the former were more shielded from the surrounding water molecules than the latter. This would improve the chance of the reaction occurring between the epoxide group in the second affinitylabeling reagent molecule and the side-chain carboxylate group of Glu35 in the singly labeled HLs. The side-chain group of Gln 104 in the singly labeled HLs became significantly covered up due to the following attachment of the second ligand part in the doubly labeled HLs. Actually, the solvent-accessible surface area of Gln104, the bridging residue between the first ligand part and the second ligand part, was remarkably reduced in the doubly labeled HLs compared with the singly labeled HLs. As for the Nacetyllactosamine moiety in the first ligand, there was no significant difference in the solvent-accessible surface area of either the galactose residue or the N-acetylglucosamine

residue between the singly labeled HL and the singly labeled HEWL. The surface-area reduction by the addition of the second ligand part was much more significant in the N-acetylglucosamine residue of the first ligand (64.3 and 60.4% reduction with regard to wild-type HL and Glu102mutant HL, respectively) than the reduction in the galactose residue of the first ligand (17.1 and 21.7% reduction with regard to wild-type HL and Glu102-mutant HL, respectively), which verified the deep intrusion of the N-acetylglucosamine residue in the second ligand part into the cleft of the singly labeled HLs (Plate 2).

DISCUSSION
Our previous studies revealed that CH/p interactions (Nishio et al., 1995) played an essential role in determining the conformation and the affinity of the ligands in the recognition site of carbohydrate-binding proteins (Muraki, 2002), such as human lysozyme (Muraki et al., 2000a), wheat-germ agglutinin (Muraki et al., 2002) and Ac-AMP2 (Muraki et al., 2000b). In Table 5, the inter-atomic contacts responsible for the major possible CH/p interactions ° ( 3.0 A) found in the affinity-labeled c-type lysozymes in the present study are listed. With respect to the singly labeled HEWL and HL, the contacting atom-pairs were largely changed between HEWL and HL due to the difference in the structure of aromatic ring between Trp62 and Tyr63. Only two common contacts were observed. Also, the number of possible CH/p interactions decreased

from 10 in the singly labeled HL to seven in the singly labeled HEWL. In the doubly labeled wild-type HL, the bound conformation of the first ligand part was suggested to be considerably supported by CH/p interactions (Muraki, 2002). Therefore, the reduction of HEWL in the efficiency of the dual labeling from HL may be partly ascribed to the above changes in CH/p interactions. In contrast, 11 of the 13 possible CH/p interactions between the first ligand part and the protein part in the doubly labeled wild-type HL was conserved in the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL. It was considered that these CH/p interactions in conjunction with the specific hydrogen-bonding interactions again contributed to the construction of the structural details to put up the second ligand part into the newly formed cleft accurately. The recognition of the second ligand part by the singly labeled lysozyme significantly depended on the carbohydrate­carbohydrate interactions between the first ligand

part and the second ligand part. As shown in Fig. 5, six and five possible direct carbohydrate­carbohydrate hydrogenbonding interactions were observed for the dual affinity labeled Glu102-mutant HL and the dual-labeled wild-type HL, respectively. Four interactions were conserved between them. Among the conserved interactions, the three interactions involving the two galactose residues belonging to each ligand part were considered to play a key role for the recognition, since the hydrogen bonds showing the distance ° of less than 3.1 A were spatially clustered in this particular region. Table 6 summarizes the number of the atomic contacts that can contribute to the attractive van der Waals interactions between the first ligand part and the second ligand part in the dual affinity labeled HLs. In the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL, the number of the galactose residue to galactose residue contacts, which was the most abundant atomic contacts in the doubly labeled wild-type HL, substantially decreased. On the other hand, the number

of the contacts between the N-acetylglucosamine residue of the first ligand part and the galactose residue of the second ligand part remarkably increased. The number of the contacts between the other pairs of structural parts did not

change greatly. The above results indicated that the N-acetyllactosamine moiety of the second ligand part in the doubly labeled Glu102-mutant HL so altered the conformation of the glycosidic linkage (Table 2) that the

galactose residue became closer to the N-acetylglucosamine residue of the first ligand rather than the galactose residue of the first ligand from the conformation in the doubly labeled wild-type HL, without losing the important attractive interactions toward the first ligand part. Recently, it has been suggested that specific carbohydrate­carbohydrate interactions played an important role in the recognition processes on cell surface (Eggens et al., 1989; Bovin, 1996). In most of the oligosaccharide structures participating in the presently known carbohydrate­ carbohydrate interactions, a galactose residue exists as the component and often linked to another carbohydrate residue (X) with a Galb1,4X-type glycosidic linkage (Bovin, 1996). This fact suggests the general importance of such structure in the carbohydrate­carbohydrate interactions. Therefore, the importance of the Galb1,4X structure may also be related to the predominance of Galb1,4GlcNAc over GlcNAcb1,4GlcNAc and Manb1,4GlcNAc in the dual labeling of HL (Muraki et al., 1999), in which carbohydrate­carbohydrate interactions play a pivotal role. Two principally different mechanisms in the carbohydrate­ carbohydrate interactions on cell-surface membranes have been suggested. One is the `side-by-side' mechanism between the carbohydrate moieties belonging to the same membrane, and the other one is the `head-to-head' mechanism, in which two membrane surfaces were involved in the interaction (Bovin, 1996). In the case of the dual affinity labeling of c-type lysozyme with Galb1,4GlcNAc-Epo, the attachment sites of two epoxide group in the labeling reagent to the protein molecule are close to each other and

the two N-acetyllactosamine moieties located in parallel, hence the mode of the interactions seems to be more relevant to the `side-by-side' type mechanism. Because of the rather low affinity between the interacting carbohydrate chains themselves, the additional interactions mediated by the non-carbohydrate component might play a critical role in the molecular recognition for a biological function based on carbohydrate­carbohydrate interactions (Bovin, 1996). Actually, the aggregation of mice teratocarcinoma cells mediated by the LeÂ­LeÂ interactions were observable only in the presence of Ca2 or other bivalent cations (Eggens et al., 1989). In the present study, it was proved that Gln104 in HL worked as the bridging component of the two N-acetyllactosamine chains by forming several specific hydrogen bonds with them. In the case of LeÂ­LeÂ interaction, the interaction of single molecules was too weak to be observed under the physiological condition even in the presence of Ca2 by routine physical methods such as NMR (Wormald et al., 1991). However, in the case of the present study, the trapping through the attachment to the carboxylate groups of lysozyme molecule via a covalent bond enabled us to observe the mode of interactions in detail by X-ray crystallography. This experimental approach combining affinity labeling with X-ray crystallography should also be helpful in gaining new insights into the recognition mechanism in other important biomolecular interactions, which are not strong enough to be able to observe the details directly by conventional physical methods at the atomic level. The N-acetyllactosamine structure is ubiquitously found in glycoproteins and glycolipids integrated in cell membranes as the main component of poly-N-acetyllactosaminoglycans (Varki et al., 1999). Therefore, it is speculated that the carbohydrate­ carbohydrate interaction mode between two N-acetyllactosamine moieties revealed in this study might play a certain role in the organization of the multi-molecular complexes on cell-surface membranes, such as plasma membrane associated lipid-raft structures (London, 2002).
