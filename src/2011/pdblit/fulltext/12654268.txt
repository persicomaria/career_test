A high resolution structure of hen egg-white lysozyme containing 36-C_ mot Hz0 per mol of protein has been obtained using triciinic (P,) crystals 1 cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. Analysis of dehydration-induced structural changes has revealed displacement in relative position of domains and numerous small displacements in positions of individual atoms with r.m.s. deviation of main atoms 0.60 A, and that of all atoms 0.97 A. An increase in the average packing density of atoms in dry lysozyme by 4-6s seems to be the most probable reason for the loss of its activity and mobility.

1. INTRODUCTION
The use of X-ray analysis to monitor dehydrationinduced structural changes in proteins has been inhibited by the conventional viewpoint that the drying of protein crystals causes a fading of the diffraction pattern and a decrease in the minimum X-ray spacing, making it impossibly to analyze the structure with a high resolution. This phenomenon was discovered at
Diffraction data were collected for 98, 70, 39, 30 and 0.01% humidities using a SYNTAX Pt, 4-circle automatic diffractometer, Intensities were corrected for LP, radiation damage and adsorption [7], The programs CORELS [8] and PROFFT [9] were used for the refinement of the structure, with the last one being an improved version of the PROLSQ [IO]. The structure of the hydrated (230 + 8 HzO/protcin mol) lysozyrne in the mother liquid with water activity corresponding to 98% humidity, was refined starting from the coordinates of the 7LYZ model in the Brookhaven Data Bank. Each structure with a reduced water content was refined in a step-wise procedure using coordinates of more hydrated lysozyme. In refinement of the structure of the `dry' molecule 6185 independent reflections were taken in a zone between IO and t .8 A. 2781 covalent bond lengths, I78 bond angles, 144 chiral centers and 640 torsion angles were used as steric limitations in the refinement. The final value of the R-factor in Ihe resolution zone berween 5 and I .8 A reached 0.27; r.m.s. deviation of the bond lengths from the standard values was 0.025 A. Wafer molecules were not includcd in the refinement at this stage (refinement with water molecules included is now in progress).

the very beginning of X-ray anaiysis of proteins [ 1] and repeatedly observed later. However, it does not occur in all protein crystals. Recently we have found that triclinic crystals of hen egg-white lysozyme, even when extensively dehydrated, retain their ability to diffract X-rays at high angles [2,3]. In this work this unique property of the crystals is used to obtain the structure of the lysozyme molecule in a hydrated state and to compare this structure with that in more hydrated forms.

AND DISCUSSION

Triclinic (PI) crystals of hen egg-white Iysozyme were grown and cross-linked with plutaraldchyd~ as described in [41q Crystals were deil~drated for several days in open quartz capill~~rics placed in a closcd chamber over CaCl~ solutions (98-32Vo humidity range), 01'silica gel (about O.OlO%), `rile amount of water in the crystal at any given ~lul~tid~t~ was cteterlllin~cl from its dcl~ydratioI1 isoII~er1~ [S,6]. The unit ccl1 parameters of the `dry' crystal (dried over silica gel) wcrc: c/=26.18 /i, l13.30.67 h, c=32.33 A, (~=84.8~, ,o'=llS.l",

The loss of 80% of all intracrystalline water in the crystal resulted in shrinkage of its unit cell volume by 16@70,accompanied with a rotation of the lysozyme molecule as a whole by 1. I o and a shift in position of its center of gravity by 0.15 A [3). Changes in internal structure of the lysotyme molecule wcrc calculated by fitting the whole structures

of hydrated and dry mo~ccuies, individual domains or elements of secondary structure. The results, presented in Figs, l-3 and in Table It, show that the average ~~ydration-induced perturbations in internal structure of
the molecule are not large, they do not exceed the dif-

ferences between the structures of homologous proteins. The dehydration-induced displacements are seen from Fig. 1 to be nearly equal to the overall deviations in position of atoms calculated from B-factor. However, no correlation between the distributions of these parameters over the amino-acid sequence seems to exist. R.m.s. deviations in position of main-chain atoms of a-helices are almost everywhere lower than average one and the r.m.s. deviations in loops. Comparing the figures in the last two columns of Table I, one can conclude that r.m.s. deviations in position of the atoms originate both from the internal distortion of structural elements aod from their displacement as a whole within the molecule, Thus, dehydration induces a motion of domains within the lysozyme molecule. It could be seen in a stereo view of atomic displacements presented in Fig. 2 and may be described as a relative rotation of the domains by 2.26" around the axes shown in the picture (it goes approximately through the positions of C, atoms of 25-28 and 56-58 residues).

Physically, the most significant difference between `dry' and `wet' lysozyme molecules seems to consist in compression of the globule upon drying. The inflated molecular volume calculated according to [ 1I] at 98, 30 and 0.01% humidities is equal to 1.93 *IO*A', 1.84. lo4 A3 and 1.82' IO4 A3, respectively. Drying compresses the whole molecule and its domains by about 4-6`70, The volume deformation found is in good agreement with the energies available in the dehydration process.

kJ/moi for energy needed to compress the globule volume by 5%. This is nearly a half of the entire dehydration energy of the crystal, calculated from its isotherm [6]. These smaI1 changes in density packing of protein atoms may explain the drastic differences in catalytic activity [13], hydrogen exchange rate [14] and other mobility-related properties of dried proteins as compared to completely hydrated ones, since they are comparable with the volume changes accompanying melting of molecular crystals and with the overall thermal free volume, which makes space for motion of atoms in native proteins (a simple estimate has given about 4% for the last value [l!!]), Another reason for drastic decrease in enzymatic activity may be dehydration-induced perturbation in the conformation of side chain groups involved in the active site cleft. A detailed analysis of changes in position of these and other side chains and strongly bound water moieculcs is now in progress and will be published elsewhere. It is worth noting that dehydration-induced compression of the molecule seen from Fig. 3 is not uniform, (relative changes of distances in a uniformly deformed body would be constant), presumably reffecting inhomoge~~e~tyin elastic properties of the lysotymc structure. Another peculiarity of the plots in Fig. 3 needing to be explained, is a peak displaying the stretching in in-

ieratomic distances between the nearest neighboring atoms. Since very small atom displacements (less than 0.1 A) are responsible for the peak, we cannot exclude this peak to be an artifact of the refinement procedure used. However, it might be physically relevant because repacking of the protein atoms upon dehydration appears to be accompanied by distortions in their surrounding.
