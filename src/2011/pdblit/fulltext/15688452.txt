Introduction. Clostridium perfringens is a ubiquitous anaerobic bacterium that is commonly found not only in soil but also in the gastrointestinal tract of higher animals. Its pathogenicity has been reviewed extensively.1­3 As a major cause of gastrointestinal infections in humans and animals,4 C. perfringens is suspected to employ hydrolytic enzymes in the degradation of gastrointestinal mucous glycoproteins. A unique endo- -galactosidase, Endo- -GalGnGa, capable of releasing GlcNAc 1-4Gal from porcine gastric mucin was discovered serendipitously as a contaminant of a commercially available C. perfringens sialidase preparation.5 Further characterization revealed small but significant sequence similarities with known glycosidases, including several enzymes from Bacillus sp.6 Endo- -GalGnGa has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli.6 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of Endo- -GalGnGa were undertaken in order to explain the distinctive behavior of these enzymes based on a structural model in atomic detail. Materials and Methods. The crystallization of Endo- GalGnGa was described previously.7 A crystal was transferred to a 1 L drop of a 1:2:7 mixture of 2 M aqueous potassium iodide solution, glycerol, and crystallization reservoir solution [42% ammonium sulfate, 2% polyethylene glycol (PEG400), 0.1 M N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N 2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES-Na) at pH 7.4] and incubated for 5 s.8 The crystal was mounted in a fiber loop9 and flash-frozen10 in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 1.7 Å wavelength at beamline 17BM (IMCA-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) using a MAR 165 chargecoupled device (CCD) detector at a 110 mm crystal-todetector distance. Six sets of 160 0.5° oscillation images were recorded using a redundant inverse beam strategy. Another crystal was obtained from a separate but identically composed crystallization experiment and transferred to a 1 L drop of a 1:4 mixture of glycerol and reservoir solution. It was immediately mounted in a fiber loop and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 0.98 Å wavelength at beamline 22ID (SER-CAT) at the APS using a MAR 165 CCD detector at a 130 mm crystal-to©

detector distance. A single sweep of 180 0.5° oscillation images was recorded. Diffraction data were indexed, integrated and scaled (Table I) using the HKL2000 software suite.11 Phases were determined using SOLVE12 from single-wavelength anomalous scattering data, measured using 1.7 Å X-rays, from the iodide ions incorporated from the potassium iodide soaking. After phase refinement with RESOLVE,13,14 automated tracing was performed using the 0.98 Å wavelength data set and the program ARP/wARP.15 The final model was obtained after several cycles of manual adjustment of the initial model using Xfit,16 followed by restrained refinement with REFMAC517 and validation with the MOLPROBITY online tool.18 Other programs of the CCP4 suite19 were used through its graphical user interface20 as indicated. Structural similarity searches were carried out using the DALI server.21 The model (Table II) was deposited at the Protein Data Bank22 (PDB) with access code 1UPS. Results and Discussion. The asymmetric unit of hexagonal Endo- -GalGnGa crystals contains 2 copies of the glycosidase polypeptide. Each peptide chain-folds into 2 globular domains linked by a partially disordered loop (Figs. 1 and 2). The N-terminal domain extends to residue 279. The C-terminus folds into a much smaller domain beginning at residue 290. Both domains are predominantly composed of -strands. The larger of the 2 domains resembles a sandwich of antiparallel sheets, also seen in some other glycoside

hydrolases and in legume lectins. It exhibits significant structural similarity to -carrageenase of Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora (PDB entry: 1DYP25). The 2 structures are superimposable, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.3 Å.21 Sequence alignment produces 40 identical residues over a 184-residue section (21%).26 Significant similarity is also found when Endo- -GalGnGa is compared with the complex between licheninase and a covalently bound suicide substrate (1BYH,27 RMSD 2.4 Å, Fig. 3). The comparison of the structures produces a set of conserved residues EXDX(X)E. Table III shows the conserved residues for these glycanases and, in addition, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I.28 In licheninase, E105 (E168 in Endo- -GalGnGa) has been established to act as the nucleophile in the initial formation of the glycosyl enzyme intermediate.27 E168 in -carrageenase

(E173 in Endo- -GalGnGa) was proposed to act as an activator of the nucleophilic water in the deglycosylation step.25 Residues equivalent to D170 in Endo- -GalGnGa reportedly fulfill several functions at different stages of glycoside hydrolysis. In T. reesei endoglucanase I (PDB entry: 1EG128), D198 is thought to maintain the nucleophilic residue E196 in the deprotonated state prior to the formation of the glycosyl enzyme intermediate. In addition, it is believed that D165 in -carrageenase facilitates the decay of the final transition state in the catalytic cycle.25 This aspartate/aspartic acid residue may be separated from the nucleophilic glutamate by either 1 or 2 residues. In the case of 2 separating residues, as in Endo- -GalGnGa, the additional residue is accommodated by formation of a bulge, with the carbonyl oxygen of residue W148 hydrogen bonding with the peptide nitrogens of both I171 and L172. An experimental model of Endo- -GalGnGa bound to an active site inhibitor is not available. However, inspection of the coordinates of a suicide substrate covalently bound to licheninase (PDB entry: 1BYH) permit the hypothesis that the substrate specificity Endo- -GalGnGa is determined in part by the structure of some of its loop regions. Marked differences from similar structures are apparent. Based on the alignment of Endo- -GalGnGa with both licheninase and -carrageenase, the primary structure of Endo- -GalGnGa shows the insertion of a loop (between residues S100 and T125, 1UPS numbering). Together with a smaller loop from Y51 to A65, it blocks one end of the channel containing the putative active site. A major distinguishing feature of Endo- -GalGnGa is an

additional C-terminal domain encompassing 131 residues, starting at residue 290. It is connected to the N-terminal domain by a stretch of 10 residues (280 ­289). Residues E287 and S288 are disordered in both peptide chains A and B of the asymmetric unit in PDB entry 1UPS. The position of the C-terminal domain with respect to the larger domain differs significantly between chains A and B. After superimposing the larger domain of chain B onto chain A (CCP4 program LSQKAB29), with an RMSD of 0.3 Å, the coordinates of the smaller domain remain displaced by several angstroms (Fig. 4). It should be noted that the isolated small domains of the model can be superimposed with a C RMSD of less than 0.2 Å. The overall structure of the C-terminal domain closely resembles a cylindrical barrel composed of 12 antiparallel -strands that are arranged in six 2-strand sheets (Figs. 1 and 2). Examples for this fold are found in the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)30 and the C-terminal domain of amaranthin31 (Table IV). The structural similarity of the C-terminal domain with other carbohydratebinding proteins suggests a role in the activity of Endo- GalGnGa. Of significance in this context may be the strong affinity of bFGF for heparin, a polymer of 1­ 4 linked GlcNAc 1-4IdoA repeats,32 somewhat similar to the GlcNAc 1-4Gal product of Endo- -GalGnGa substrate hydrolysis. Furthermore, the T-antigen bound to amaranthin (Gal 1-3GalNAc 1-Ser/Thr33) shows similarity with the GlcNAc 1-4Gal 1-3GalNAc 1-Ser/Thr substrate that Endo- -GalGnGa was also shown to cleave.5 A role of the C-terminus in substrate binding is therefore indicated, but alternative binding modes seem possible. Functional studies with the truncated N-terminus will address whether the C-terminus is required for activity. Conclusions. Endo- -GalGnGa is a protein consisting of 2 flexibly linked domains. The presence of a smaller Cterminal domain distinguishes it from other structurally related glycosidase in the PDB. The analysis of this domain reveals its relationship with several carbohydratebinding proteins. It may contribute to the function of Endo- -GalGnGa in several ways. The conservation of catalytically relevant amino acid residues in Endo- GalGnGa within the group of related enzymes can clearly be established both through sequence analysis and protein model comparisons. However, the structure of Endo- -

The flexibility of the interdomain link is illustrated by the significant offset of the smaller C-terminal domains. The dashed lines represent the partially disordered connecting loops.

GalGnGa exhibits significant differences in loop regions in close proximity to the active site that presumably contribute to its specificity. Acknowledgments.
