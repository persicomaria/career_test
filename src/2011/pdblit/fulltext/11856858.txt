Structural characterization of a new crystal form of the four-way Holliday junction formed by the DNA sequence d(CCGGTACCGG)2: sequence versus lattice?
DNA-strand exchange is a vital step in the recombination process, of which a key intermediate is the four-way DNA Holliday junction formed transiently in most living organisms. Here, the single-crystal Ê structure at a resolution of 2.35 A of such a DNA junction formed by d(CCGGTACCGG)2, which has crystallized in a more highly symmetrical packing mode to that previously observed for the same sequence, is presented. In this case, the structure is isomorphous to the mismatch sequence d(CCGGGACCGG)2, which reveals the roles of both lattice and DNA sequence in determining the junction geometry. The helices cross at the larger angle of 43.0 (the previously observed angle for this sequence was 41.4 ) as a right-handed X. No metal cations were observed; the crystals were grown in the presence of only group I counter-cations.

1. Introduction
DNA junctions play an important role in the physiology of cells, where the Holliday junction is a central recombination intermediate formed through the strand exchange of two homologous DNA molecules to give a fourway junction at the crossover (Holliday, 1964). Such systems are the target of many recombiÂ nation enzymes (Ceschini et al., 2001; Declais et al., 2001; Nishino et al., 2001; Ristriani et al., 2001; West & Austin, 1999; Sekiguchi et al., 1996) that promote branch migration or catalyse its resolution, allowing the exchange of genetic information between DNA duplexes. The four-way junction is, therefore, a highly distinctive structural motif, which the junctionresolving enzymes must recognize at the molecular level through a currently unidenti®ed mechanism (Lilley & White, 2001). The recent structural characterization of several Holliday junctions (Eichman et al., 2000, 2001; Ortiz-Lombardia et al., 1999) formed by DNA decamer sequences have revealed a remarkable similarity in the crystal packing orientations of both the stacked-X structure Holliday junctions and the decanucleotide B-DNA structures, with nearidentical unit-cell parameters in both cases for the monoclinic space group C2. In the present work, it was impossible to deduce the presence or absence of the junction from the lattice parameters alone, which may hint at a reason why the junction structure was not demonstrated for so many years. The two native junctions currently reported are the inverted repeat sequence d(CCGGTACCGG)2, with all B-DNA arms, Watson±Crick base pairing and no internal symmetry, and the mismatched sequence d(CCGGGACCGG)2, where two

GÁA mismatched base pairs sit adjacent to the crossover on a twofold symmetry axis. The inverted repeat structure therefore has an asymmetric unit of four nucleotide strands, whereas the mismatched structure has only two (see Table 1). Here, we report the inverted repeat structure but, unexpectedly, with the structural unit already reported for the mismatched sequence, each in the space group C2. The overall packing is the same in both cases, but our observation offered the possibility of de®ning to what extent the differences found between the two already published structures are a consequence of the presence or absence of symmetry constraints, set alongside the distorting effect of base-pair mismatching.

2. Materials and methods
Crystals were grown by sitting-drop vapour diffusion from conditions optimized from the Hampton Research Nucleic Acid Mini Screen yielding 40 mM sodium cacodylate pH 7.0, 12 mM spermine, 80 mM KCl, 10%(v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) with 1 mM d(CCGGTACCGG)2 and equilibrated against 1 ml 35% MPD. Thin diamond-shaped crystals of approximate dimensions 300 Â 200 Â 50 mm were grown at 290 K. A single crystal was mounted in a loop with cryoprotectant per¯uoropolyether (RS 3000) oil and ¯ashcooled to 100 K under a nitrogen stream. Data were collected using a MAR345 image plate in small mode with synchrotron radiation at Ê ! = 1.073 A from the EMBL X31 beamline, Hamburg and were further processed and reduced with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1995).

starting model was taken from the B-DNA decamer duplex sequence with the most closely correlated cell parameters, d(CGCAATTGCG)2 (Wood et al., 1997), with the appropriate bases changed. The orientation of this initial duplex model was optimized with the CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) version of the program MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 1997), yielding a correlation coef®cient of 60.3% and an R factor of 61.4%. The resulting model showed an

overlap with a symmetry-related strand at the centre of the decamer sequence, suggesting the presence of the Holliday junction. The mismatched DNA stacked-X structure coordinates, d(CCGGGACCGG)2, with the mismatched guanine replaced by thymine were then used as a starting model, rather than the d(CCGGTACCGG)2 coordinates, because of the closely related unit-cell parameters (see Table 1) and the model was again optimized with MOLREP. This yielded a

correlation coef®cient of 44.6% and an R factor of 69.1%, which was less favourable than before. Re®nement was carried out with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) through maximum-likelihood methods with an overall isotropic B factor re®ned and model ®tting with XTALVIEW (McRee, 1999). Both models showed clear continuous backbone density in the strand-crossover region of the map, with the structure in the form of the Holliday junction (Fig. 1a). Solvent sites were modelled by hand through ' A and difference maps checked for stabilizing cations, but none could be de®nitively modelled and all were ®nally set to be oxygen. Re®nement converged to give a ®nal conventional R factor of 22.64% and an Rfree of 26.78%. A summary of the re®nement statistics is given in Table 2. Comparative helical analysis was carried out with CURVES (Lavery & Sklenar, 1988) and both coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the NDB.1

3. Results and discussion
The relationship between the C2 lattice adopted and the formation of duplex or quadruplex has been very clearly de®ned by Eichman et al. (2000). In their work, the asymmetric unit is either a quadruplex or a duplex, with the c-axial length doubled when the sequence crystallizes as a quadruplex, where the four identical DNA strands have an approximate twofold symmetry. The overall packing is remarkably similar whether a duplex or a quadruplex has been

formed, with duplex helices crossing at approximately the same angle in either case, shown in Table 1. It is striking that the reported crossover angles for the two duplexes show a larger variability than all the reported quadruplexes. Table 1 also makes clear that it would be very unwise to use the lattice constants as a guide to whether a particular sequence has crystallized as a quadruplex or duplex; any potentially quadruplex-forming sequence in this packing should be fully re®ned to reveal the direction of the connected backbone density. Prior to the crystallization of any authentic junction, the close resemblance to a junction-like packing was reported for the DNA sequence d(CGCAATTGCG)2, as a potential model for the Holliday junction (Wood et al., 1997), prior to its ®nal solution. In the present work, the four-way junction formed shows a twofold crystallographic axis running through the centre of the helix crossover (Fig. 1a), which is now isomorphous with the structure obtained using the mismatched sequence d(CCGGGACCGG) (Ortiz-Lombardia et al., 1999). From these structural results, we can begin to build an overall picture of the consistency of the Holliday stacked-X conformation. Table 1 illustrates each structure to be remarkably similar at the low resolutions thus far obtained, with helix-crossover angles of $40 for these crystallographic studies, an angle not as steep as the 60 reported in solution studies (Duckett et al., 1988). Also consistent, but in this case not differentiated from the two-duplex model, is the separation of the phosphates at the junction crossover (see Fig. 1b), where we observe a Ê distance of 6.28 A between them [P7(A)± P7(A)*]. These strained phosphates are stabilized through hydrogen-bonded interactions between the cytosine N4 sites on either side of the crossover, with the cytosine prior to the crossover hydrogen bonding to the phosphate O atom at the centre of the stacked-X motif [C8(A)± P7(A)] and the cytosine at the crossover hydrogen bonding to the phosphate O atom prior to the crossover [C7(A)±P6(A)] in the major groove. These observed hydrogen bonds in the current model are fairly long, Ê with the shortest distance being 3.21 A. However, they also go some way towards explaining why such a junction has not previously been observed for the numerous decanucleotide sequences which have been previously studied, as it would appear these two cytosine residues are essential for the stabilization of the strained phosphate crossover, as proposed by Eichman et al. (2000). The role of metal ions in the structure and function of nucleic acids is central and has long been studied (e.g. Schneider et al., 1996). Metal ions can bind to several donor sites on polynucleotides, but chie¯y bind to phosphate links along the backbone and nitrogen donors on bases. They have been assumed to have key roles in junction stabilization, particularly of the junction phosphates. In the previously reported junction structure of Eichman et al. (2000), a cation site, identi®ed as Na+ from its short Ê distances to adjacent O atoms (<2.5 A), bridges the strained phosphates at the junction crossover. Analysis of the crystallization conditions employed for the other Holliday sequences shows each of them to have been crystallized in the presence of a group II metal halide (Mg2+ or Ca2+) in addition to other Na+ salts, but no divalent cations have been located in any of the quadruplex structures. The crystals grown here were grown in the presence of only the group I halide KCl (plus other Na+ salts), with no ions de®nitively placed; more importantly, none were found on the twofold axis at the centre of the junction, although 43 other distinct water sites were located during the re®nement. None of these have a coordination environment characteristic of a group I metal. The role of metal ions in junction stabilization clearly warrants further investigation. The structural characterization of the Holliday junctions has provided a major extension of our insight into the conformational ¯exibility of DNA and its higher order structure. From these structures, we can begin to understand the enzyme-recognition processes which must occur, allowing the design of DNA-binding agents exhibiting a speci®city towards such junctions. Such compounds providing a potential means of blocking the recombination process at the cellular level, a huge step forward in the drug-discovery program.
