SM AY U MR The phosphorylation and decarboxylation of mevalonate by 105,000g supernatant fractions from livers of suckling and weaned rats was studied. The rate of mevalonate phosphate formation by SlO5 fraction from suckling rats was not significantly different from that observed in rats weaned on control (Purina Chow) diet. The decarboxylation of mevalonate by preparations from weaned rats, however, was 5 - 20 times higher than the decarboxylation by preparations from suckling rats. In spite of the fact that the amount of mevalonate pyrophosphate (MVAPP) is s l i g h t l y lower in preparations from suckling rats, the ratio of MVAPP/C02 formed was considerably higher. In preparations from rats weaned on diet supplemented with I% cholesterol the decarboxylation of mevalonate was reduced by 50 - 80%, while the rate of MVAP formation and the ratio of MVAPP/CO2 produced were similar to those observed in the preparations from suckling rats. These results hence indicate that decarboxylation of MVAPP is a key rate-limiting step in the conversion of mevalonate to squalene. INTRODUCTION W recently reported that the incorporation of mevalonate (MVA) into e non-saponifiable lipids (squalene) is low in cell-free preparations of livers from suckling rats as compared with the incorporation in preparations from weaned rats (1).

and the reactions were terminated by injecting O.2ml of 5 N H2SO into the 4 main compartments. The flasks were shaken for an additional 60 min, for the complete absorption of the liberated [14C02]. The contents of the center wells were transferred quantitatively to liquid scintillation vials for radioactivity measurements. To measure phosphorylation of M A and V MVAP, the reactions were terminated by immersing the flasks in boiling water for 3 min. The contents of the flasks were transferred to centrifuge tubes and the precipitated proteins were sedimented. MVA,MVAPand mevalonate pyrophosphate (MVAPP) present in the supernatant fractions were separated by descending paper chromatography in a solvent system consisting of tertbutyl alcohol:formic acid:H2O (20:5:8, v/v/v) as described by Tchen (3). Discrete areas containing [14C], located by scanning in Nuclear Chicago Actigraph I I I , were transferred to scintillation vials containing aquasol and assayed for radioactivity.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The conversion of MVA to MVAPP is accomplished by two successive phosphorylations by the enzymes mevalonate kinase (EC 2.4.1.36) and phosphomevalonate kinase (EC 2.7.4.2). MVAPPis then enzymatically decarboxylated

to form isopentenyl pyrophosphate. The data presented in Fig. 1 show decarboxylation of MVA as a function of time and of protein concentration. As can be seen, the rate of decarboxylation by hepatic SlO5 from suckling rats was very low as compared with the rate of decarboxylation by preparations from weaned rats. To determine whether the low rate of decarboxylation of MVA was associated with reduced a c t i v i t i e s of mevalonate kinase or phosphomevalonate kinase or of both, we examined the formation of MVAP and MVAPP. The results in Table I show that the rate of formation of MVAP by SlO5 fractions from suckling rats was not s i g n i f i c a n t l y d i f f e r e n t from the rates observed in animals weaned on control (Purina Chow) d i e t . In contrast, there was a

s i g n i f i c a n t and progressive decrease in MVA decarboxylase a c t i v i t y during 44

This change

in the decarboxylase a c t i v i t y in suckling and weaned animals is s t r i k i n g l y similar to the pattern observed in the incorporation of M A into nonV saponifiable lipids and digitonin precipitable sterols (1). The data

presented in Table I further show that the ratio of MVAPPto C02 produced was considerably higher in suckling rats as compared to the ratio in weaned rats. These results thus suggest that decarboxylation of MVAPP

is one of the key regulatory steps in the conversion of mevalonate to squalene. The data in Table I also show that when the rats were weaned on diet supplemented with I% cholesterol, the post-weaning increase in the decarboxylase a c t i v i t y was p a r t i a l l y prevented. Again, as in suckling rats, the formation of MVAPand the ratio of MVAPP/C02 formed remained high in preparations from rats weaned on I% cholesterol diet. These results, taken

in conjunction with our earlier findings (4) that the post-weaning increase in the conversion of mevalonate to squalene was partially prevented by weaning animals on diet supplemented with cholesterol, further suggest that decarboxylation of I~APP is a regulatory step in weaned animals as well. It

is likely that the low levels of hepatic decarboxylase activity in suckling rats are associated with the cholesterol in maternal milk. Further examination of the data in Table I reveals that the formation of MVAPPis approximately 50% lower in suckling rats than in the rats weaned on Purina Chow diet. This observation raises the possibility that the I t should, however, be

activity of MVAPkinase is also rate-limiting.

borne in mind that since the reaction catalyzed by MVAPkinase is reversible (5), the amount of MVAPPformed or accumulated is regulated by the equilibrium constant (Keq) of the kinase reaction, particularly when the rate of forward reaction, namely [~APP decarboxylation, is low. llence, the reduced amounts of MVAPPformed in the preparations from the suckling rats do not necessarily reflect the lower activity of MVAPkinase.
