ABSTRACT: TcUBP1 is a trypanosome cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein containing a single, conserved RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain involved in selective destabilization of U-rich mRNAs such as the Trypanosoma cruzi small mucin gene family mRNA, TcSMUG. TcUBP1 binds specific transcripts in ViVo and co-localizes in the perinuclear part of the cell with components of the mRNA-stability determinant pathway such as poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) and TcUBP2, a closely related RRM-containing protein. In TcUBP proteins, the RRM domain is flanked by N-terminal Gln-rich and C-terminal GlyGln-rich extensions, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. In this work, we determined the solution structure of the TcUBP1 RRM domain by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The domain has a characteristic R R fold, consisting of a sheet composed of four antiparallel strands and two R helices packed against one face of the sheet. A unique aspect of TcUBP1 is the participation of a hairpin ( 4- 5) in the sheet, resulting in an enlarged RNA-binding surface. Detailed analysis of the TcUBP1 interaction with a short single-stranded RNA derived from the 3 UTR of TcSMUG was carried out by titration experiments using both NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. This analysis revealed that amino acids located within the hairpin ( 4- 5) contribute to complex formation. This enlarged protein-RNA interface could compensate for the lack of additional RNA-binding domains in TcUBP1, as observed in many other RRM-containing proteins. The structure of TcUBP1 reveals new aspects of single RRM-RNA interactions and insight into how N- and C-terminal extensions can contribute to RNA binding.

Trypanosomes are widespread protozoan microorganisms from the order Kinetoplastida, which cause important health problems in millions of people. The causative agent of Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (1). In this unicellular organism, transcription is not the major point of control of gene expression. In fact, protein expression is unique in that it is not regulated through transcription initiation but via posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, including transsplicing coupled with polyadenylation (2) and modifications of mRNA half-life (3, 4). In particular, post-transcriptional

mechanisms mediated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)1 are of key importance in the expression of life-cycle-dependent antigens and regulatory factors. The major group of RBPs in trypanosomes is the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) group [alternatively known as RBD (RNA-binding domain)] (5). In addition to this motif, zinc finger, SR-rich, RGG-box, and PUF-containing RBPs have been described. These ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes are involved in a compendium of processes in these organisms such as transcription, RNA processing, localization, and translation (reviewed in ref 5). A key element involved in mRNA stabilization/destabilization is the AU-rich element (ARE) located in the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of short-lived mRNAs (6, 7). This cis-acting degradation signal identified first in protooncogenes, lymphokines, and cytokines is divided into three classes depending on the copy number (class I and II) and/ or the absence (class III) of the AUUUA motif. Many proteins that bind such motifs have been described biochemi1 Abbreviations: ARE, AU-rich element; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum correlation; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; PABP, poly(A)binding protein; RBD, RNA-binding domain; RBP, RNA-binding protein; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; RRM, RNA-recognition motif; TcSMUG, Trypanosoma cruzi small mucin gene family; Sxl, sex-lethal protein; TcUBP, Trypanosoma cruzi uridine-rich-binding protein; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; UTR, untranslated regions.

NMR Study of TcUBP1 and RNA Binding

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 10, 2005 3709

FIGURE 1: (A) Sequence alignment of TcUBP1 and TcUBP2. The different domains constituting the proteins are the N-terminal region (Nterm), the RRM (delimited by brackets) comprising the two RNP sequences, the variable region (VR), and the Gly- and Gln-rich regions. Identical residues between both proteins are shown in bold. (B) Scheme of TcUBP1 and the different TcUBP1 constructs used in this paper.

cally and structurally, of which the ELAV/Hu protein family (8-11), the human U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein A (12-15), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 and C (16, 17) have been studied the most. In these RBPs, RRM domains, typically present in 1-3 copies, are an evolutionarily conserved domain of 90 amino acids characterized by a R R topology. It contains two signature sequences, RNP2 and RNP1, that form the central part of the sheet and are involved in RNA binding (18, 19). In trypanosomes, one of the best studied RBPs is the uridine-rich-binding protein 1 (TcUBP1) from Trypanosoma cruzi, a single RRM domain protein containing a short Glnrich N-terminal region and a Gly-Tyr and Gln-rich C-terminal region (Figure 1A) (20). TcUBP1 interacts with U-rich stretches, especially those containing guanosines or adenosines interspersed between tracts of 4 or 5 uridines (20). TcUBP1 was also shown to interact in ViVo with 3-UTR U-rich transcripts such as the mucin TcSMUG group, tssa and amastin (21). Interestingly, TcUBP1 interacts with TcSMUG only in a life-cycle-stage-dependent manner, and its overexpression produced the accelerated decay of mucin TcSMUG mRNA (20). Additionally, we described another single RRM-containing RBP named TcUBP2, which possesses a Gly-Tyr-rich C-terminal region extension. TcUBP1 and TcUBP2 have a common core structure and were predicted to fold into the three-dimensional structure characteristic of RRMs (19). The RRM domain is the most highly conserved region and responsible for RNA binding (22). The

N- and C-terminal regions of both TcUBPs are more divergent and thought to be involved in recruiting different factors to RNP complexes (D'Orso et al., unpublished data). The TcUBP1 Gly-rich domain was shown to be involved in homo- and heterodimerization with TcUBP2 (22). TcUBP1 also interacts with poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) and inhibits its binding to TcSMUG mRNA. This consequently contributes to destabilization of the mRNA (20, 22). To obtain insight into how TcUBP1 interacts with its different partners to regulate mRNA stability, we determined the solution structure of TcUBP1 and analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical-shift mapping its interactions with the GU-rich RNA element from one of its target mRNAs, TcSMUG. The study provides a structural framework for further biochemical studies of TcUBP1 function. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Preparation of NMR Samples. Different TcUBP1 recombinant protein deletions, termed NQ, GQ, and NGQ, were prepared by PCR as previously described (22) (Figure 1B). The primers used for TcUBP1 protein deletions were as follows: NH2-int-BamHI (5-CGGGATCCATGAACCCCGAGCCCGATGTT-3) and Gln-as-EcoRI (5-CGAATTCTTACGCGTACGGGTTCGCAGCG-3) for TcUBP1 (NQ), NH2-BamHI (5-CGGGATCCATGAGCCAAATTCCGTTGGTTTC-3) and NES-as-EcoRI (5-CGAATTCTTAGGGGCGCTGGTGACCACTGGCC-3) for TcUBP1 (GQ), and NH2-int-BamHI and NES-as-EcoRI for TcUBP1 (NGQ).

3710 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 10, 2005 TcUBP1 (GQ) was used for the determination of the NMR structure; TcUBP1 (NQ) was used for the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR titrations with RNA; and TcUBP1 (NGQ) was used additionally for the ITC titration. All fragments were cloned into a pGEX2T plasmid (Amersham) that expresses glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing a thrombin protease site. The C terminus of TcUBP1 (NQ) includes six extra amino acids (EFIVTD). Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 Gold/DE3 (Stratagene). Unlabeled or uniformly isotope-labeled protein was obtained by growing bacteria at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) or M9 minimal medium containing 0.5 g of 15N-NH4Cl and/or 2 g of 13C6-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory) per liter of media and 100 µg/mL of ampicilin. Protein expression was induced at 37 °C with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio- -D-galactopyranoside (IPTG). Bacteria were lysed by sonication in the presence of 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1% Triton X-100. GST fusion proteins were purified over glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) and were digested in column with 25 units of thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia) during 3 h at room temperature in 4 mL of Tris-NaCl buffer (TBS) and with mild shaking. Samples were then eluted, and thrombin was removed by absorption with p-amino-benzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma). A Centricon spin dialysis tube (5-kDa cutoff; Amicon, Inc) was used to concentrate until a 200 µL final volume was reached. Final protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 278 nm. The final buffer used for all NMR experiments was 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM NaN3 at pH 7.2. NMR Spectroscopy. Protein samples were prepared at a concentration of 1.5 mM in either 99.96% 2H2O or 90% H2O and 10% 2H2O. NMR experiments were performed at 303 K on a Bruker DRX500 and a Bruker 600 MHz AVANCE spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance inverse cryo-probe head. 1H-15N and 1H-13C nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY)-heteronuclear multiplequantum correlation (HMQC) spectra were collected on a Varian INOVA-800 spectrometer. NMR spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker Biospin) and GIFA (23) software and analyzed with XEASY (24). Sequential backbone assignments of TcUBP1 (GQ) were obtained on scalar couplings through the backbone (25, 26) using the following heteronuclear 3D spectra: HNCACB (27), CBCA(CO)NH (28), HNCA (29), and CA(CO)NH (30). This assignment was further confirmed by searching for characteristic sequential cross-peaks from the backbone amide proton to the preceding amide or a proton in an 1H15 N NOESY-HMQC experiment (31). Carbon and proton assignments were obtained from 1H-15N total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY)-HMQC, HNHA (32), C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH (33), and HNCO experiments (34). 1H, 13C, and 15 N chemical-shift assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank with accession number 6315. Backbone assignment of the Gly-rich region was done with the TcUBP1 (NQ) recombinant protein using the HNCA experiment. Additionally, analysis of the Chemical Shift Index (CSI) in this region was complemented with the assignments of the HR and C resonances from the HNHA (32) and HNCO

Volpon et al. experiments, respectively. As for the assignment, the two constructs TcUBP1 (GQ) and TcUBP1 (NQ) were used to study the backbone mobility of the different regions of the protein to minimize the cross-peak overlap of residues because of the lack of structure of the N- and C-terminal regions. Amide heteronuclear 1H[15N]-NOEs were therefore measured at 14.1 T (600 MHz for 1H) and 298 K (35). Structure Calculations. On the basis of the almost complete assignment of 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of TcUBP1, a total of 1369 NOE distance constraints (including 376 longrange NOEs) was obtained from a 2D homonuclear NOESY recorded in D2O and the two 15N- and 13C,15N-edited NOESY-HMQC spectra (m ) 100 ms). NOE analysis and assignment were performed using XEASY and ARIA (36). These NOE cross-peaks were unambiguously assigned after 3 rounds in ARIA of which about 150 were manually assigned. Distances involving ambiguous constraints, methyl groups, aromatic ring protons, and the non-stereospecifically assigned methylene protons were treated as the sum of separate contributions to the target function. Regions of regular R-helical and -strand secondary structures were determined based on CR, HR, and CO chemical shifts (37), sequential and medium-range NOE patterns, and values of 3JH HR coupling constants derived from an HNHA experiN ment (32). From this latter experiment, 47  dihedral angles were obtained and used in the ARIA protocol. A lyophilized sample of 15N-labeled TcUBP1 (GQ) was dissolved in D2O, and 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments were recorded at 10 min intervals at 303 K to identify hydrogen-bond donors. The best 20 structures having the lowest energy and least violations were then used to identify the best candidate for the acceptor. For each hydrogen bond, two distance restraints were applied, 1.5-2.3 Å for NH(i)-O(j) and 2.5-3.3 Å for N(i)-O(j). A total of 27 hydrogen bonds were consistently observed giving rise to 54 distance restraints. Also, structures were used as input for the TALOS program (38), and 55 and -dihedral angles were unambiguously validated. A total of 20 additional -dihedral and 55 new -dihedral angle constraints were consequently used in the structure calculation because 35 of the 55 validated -dihedral angles were already validated by the HNHA experiment. This ensemble of 1423 distances and 122 dihedral restraints (Table 1) was finally used in a CNS structural calculation protocol (39) using standard parameters and starting with an extended molecule to generate a total of 100 final conformers of TcUBP1 (Q). The 20 structures that show the lowest energy and did not show any distance constraint violation of more than 0.2 Å were used for further analysis. Geometry of the structures, structural parameters, and secondary-structure elements were analyzed and visualized using MOLMOL (40) and PROCHECK (41). The Nand C-terminus-unstructured regions 1-39 and 120-139 were not included in the analysis. The coordinates of these 20 structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 1U6F. NMR Titration with U-Rich RNA. The RNA sequence 5GUUUUUGUUUUUG-3 ( 260 ) 128 700 M-1 cm-1) was titrated by NMR with the TcUBP1 (NQ) protein. This RNA was synthesized and purified by the University of Calgary Regional DNA Synthesis laboratory. The oligoribonucleotide was then resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl

at pH 7.2 and 50 mM NaCl. The RNase inhibitors, Rnasin (Promega) (2%, v/v) and Heparin (Sigma) (500 µg/mL), were added to prevent RNA degradation. The pH of the RNA solution was adjusted to 7.2 by addition of NaOH. HSQC titration experiments were carried out by adding increasing concentrations of the RNA oligonucleotide to a 0.4 mM [U-15N]-labeled protein solution to reach the final 1:2 ratio of protein/RNA. ITC. Experiments were carried out on a MicroCal VPITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) using the VPViewer software for instrument control and data acquisition. The buffer used for ITC experiments was the same as for NMR. The experiments were performed at a constant temperature (15 °C) by titrating TcUBP1 (NQ) or TcUBP1 (NGQ) in a stirred reaction cell of 1.4 mL. A total of 38 injections each of 8 µL volume and 16 s duration, with a 5 min interval between each injections, were carried out using a 300 µL syringe filled with the RNA. Titration experiments were performed with 0.11 mM TcUBP1 solutions in the cell and 1.0 mM RNA solution in the syringe to ensure a final RNA/TcUBP1 ratio of 2.25:1 in the reaction cell. The different solutions and buffer solutions were thoroughly degassed by stirring under vacuum before ITC measurements. The calorimetric data were processed using the software package ORIGIN (version 7.0) provided by the manufacturer. The binding isotherm was fit by an iterative nonlinear least-squares algorithm (Marquadt method) to a binding model employing a single set of independent sites. The binding constant (Kd), molar binding stoichiometry (N), molar binding entropy (So), and molar binding enthalpy (Ho) were determined directly from the fitted curve. RESULTS Structure Determination. Different two- and threedimensional NMR spectra were recorded on TcUBP1 (GQ) and TcUBP1 (NQ) (residues 1-139 and 35-156, respectively) to assign their 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances. All of

the peaks corresponding to residues 38-137 were perfectly superimposable in the 1H-15N HSQC of both protein fragments. Around 50% of the backbone and side-chain resonances were assigned in the auxiliary regions (N-terminal, variable, and Gly-rich regions), while almost all of the 1H, 15 N, and 13C signal assignments were obtained for the structured region of the protein from residue Val41 to Ala120. This was straightforward because of the good dispersion of the cross-peaks in the 15N and 13C HSQC and the excellent magnetization transfer observed in the 1H-15N TOCSYHMQC, C(CO)NH, and H(CCO)NH experiments. Assignment of certain aliphatic protons was achieved using the strong intra- and sequential NOEs in the 1H-13C-NOESYHMQC, and aromatic side-chain protons assignments were confirmed from a 2D homonuclear NOESY in D2O. Four amides corresponding to residues Thr52, Gln58, Leu59, and Ser95 were not detected in the 15N-HSQC most likely because of exchange broadening, but their side chains were partially assigned using NOEs from the neighboring residues. As a consequence, a high number of distance restraints were

obtained (18.9 restraints per residue including dihedral restraints) and used in the structure calculation of TcUBP1 (GQ). Structural statistics for the best 20 structures are given in Table 1. Solution Structure of TcUBP1 (GQ). As expected, the N- and the C-terminal regions of TcUBP1 (GQ) were unfolded in solution as shown by the negative values of the heteronuclear NOEs in these regions (Figure 2A), the lack of structurally relevant NOEs (Figure 2B), CR and HR secondary chemical shifts (Figure 2C), and qualitative 2Hexchange experiments. The same observation was made for the Gly-rich region in TcUBP1 (NQ) (data not shown). When the folded part of the molecule is concerned, it shares the same three-dimensional structure as the other RRMcontaining proteins [such as PTB, PABP1, and sex-lethal protein (Sxl), among others] with a four-stranded sheet packed against two R helices (Figures 2C and 3) (42). The two R helices also have similar perpendicular orientations relative to each other. The hydrophobic core is stabilized by residues Leu45, Val47, Ile50, Leu59, Leu62, Phe63, Tyr66, Val72, Ile74, Val89, Phe91, Ala100, Leu104, Phe107, Ile109, Leu114, Val116, and Leu118, while positive and negative charges are spread out around the molecule. One can notice the presence of a -hairpin motif between R2 and 6 that is observed in some other RRMs of hnRNP A1 (43), Hu protein (HuD) (10), and U2AF proteins (44). This hairpin is stabilized by two backbone hydrogen bonds between residues Phe107 and Leu114. The global structure of this part of TcUBP1 appears quite rigid and exhibits an root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of only 0.46 ( 0.15 Å for backbone heavy atoms and 0.96 ( 0.18 Å for all heavy atoms. The regions that are less rigid are the loops between 2 and 3 and the hairpin between R2 and 6 (Figures 2A and 3A). NMR Mapping of the RNA-Binding Surface. Amide chemical-shift perturbations were used to identify residues that interact with RNA. This sensitive method gives qualitative information about the site of binding and affinity. During titration of TcUBP1 (NQ) with RNA, we observed that most of the backbone 1H-15N resonances shifted in a continuous manner with no obvious exchange broadening, indicative of fast exchange on the NMR time scale between

the bound and free states of the protein (Figure 4B). This is consistent with a micromolar dissociation constant (Kd). Several residues, Leu45, Asn48, and Tyr49 ( -strand 1) and Gly106, Ile109, Asn111, Arg113, Leu114, and Lys115 ( -hairpin 4- 5), displayed exchange broadening in the NMR spectra (Figure 4C), indicative of solvent exchange or more complicated exchange behavior in the bound state. These results are consistent with an ITC experiment that measured a Kd of 16.6 ( 0.1 µM between TcUBP1 (NQ) and the same GU-rich RNA (Figure 5). The RNA sequence that we used in our NMR titration (5-GUUUUUGUUUUUG-3) was chosen because it was found to be the minimal sequence capable to bind specifically TcUBP1 (20, 22). This single-stranded 13-mer is derived from the mucin TcSMUG 3 UTR, with adenosines replaced by guanosines. Previous results had shown that GU-rich sequences are better substrates for TcUBP1 binding than AU sequences (20). The chemical-shift differences between free and RNA-bound TcUBP1 (NQ) show that the RRM -sheet surface is mainly involved in this interaction (Figure 6A). The distribution of these perturbations is shown on the threedimensional solution structure of the free form of TcUBP1 in Figure 6B. The C-terminal extension comprising the variable and the Gly-rich regions also shows some chemicalshift differences but to a lesser extent. We also remarked significant chemical-shift perturbations for the two Asn44 and Asn48 side-chain amide groups that are both located on the 1 strand (in the RNP2 motif). Finally, the hairpin that protrudes between R2 and 6 appears to play a significant role in RNA recognition because a large number of residues from Gly106 to Gly122 were more or less affected by this binding. Several of these resonances were severely broadened. Small chemical-shift changes were also observed for the side-chain amide groups of Asn108 and Asn111. The ITC experiment showed that RNA binding is driven by a large negative enthalpy change (-38.1 ( 1.5 kcal mol-1), suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and/or electrostatic interactions. Given the polar and charged nature of RNA, it is likely that hydrogen-bond/electrostatic interactions contribute significantly to the binding reaction. Binding was accompanied by

a large negative entropy change (-119 cal mol-1 K-1), indicating an increase in order during the RNA binding. The larger negative enthalpy term (H), relative to the entropic contribution (S), leads to a favorable free energy (G) of binding of -6.4 ( 0.9 kcal mol-1 (Figure 5). A second ITC experiment was carried out with TcUBP1 (NGQ), residues 35-139. Very similar thermodynamic

parameters were found for the protein lacking the Gly-rich region: the Kd was 14.3 ( 0.1 µM, and the other parameters were an enthalpy (H) of -40.8 ( 1.5 kcal mol-1 and entropy (S) of -110 cal mol-1 K-1. This supports the previous finding that the 92 amino acid RRM domain is sufficient for RNA binding (22). A Model for the RRM Interaction with RNA. Although we did not determine the structure of the TcUBP1/RNA complex, we modeled the TcUBP1/RNA complex using the HADDOCK software (45) and the HuD (RRM1)/RNA (5UUUUAUUU-3) complex (10) (Figure 7). On the basis of the NMR studies in this work, we can assume the participation of the side chain of Lys115 ( 5) but also of the mainchain atoms of Arg113 ( 5) and Ala120 ( 6), which show large chemical changes upon RNA binding (Figure 6A). Other residues in the hairpin are also likely to be part of the RNA-binding surface, but no restraints were applied for that part of the protein. Also, we suggest that Phe88, which is conserved in all RNP1 motifs (Figure 6A), makes stacking interactions with the pyrimidine base of the nucleic acid residue U10 (parts C and E of Figure 7). The side chain of Arg84 (equivalent to Arg55 in hnRNPA1) also likely interacts with RNA phosphates (Figure 6). Surprisingly, the loop connecting 2 and 3, which was shown to confer specificity for RNA binding in U1A (42, 46, 47), shows very few chemical-shift perturbations in our NMR titration experiment. In studies of Sxl-RBD1+2, the 2- 3 loop was also significantly affected by RNA binding (48). For the structural modeling, we used restraints for the side chains of the following residues: Asn44, Asn48, Tyr49, Lys73, Phe88, Lys112, and Lys115 and for main-chain atoms of residues Arg113 and Ala120 (Figure 7E). The same RNA 53 orientation was chosen as in the HuD/RNA structure with the central purine base (Ade) replaced in our model by Gua7. In the resulting model, all of the applied restraints were satisfied with low calculated energy. The first uracil bases were found to interact with the side-chain amide groups of Asn108 and Asn111 and also with the positively charged side

FIGURE 6: (A) Sequence alignment of TcUBP1 with the N-terminal RRM domains of the structurally related proteins Sxl, HuD, PABP1, and hnRNP A1 also called UP1 (PDB codes 1B7F, 1FXL, 1CVJ, and 2UP1, respectively). Their sequences were aligned with TcUBP1 based on primary sequences, and their identity (in percentage) and DALI Z score are indicated on the left. Positions that do not structurally align with TcUBP1 are indicated in lowercase letters. Residues making side-chain-RNA contacts are in green, making main-chain-RNA contacts in yellow, and making both main- and side-chain-RNA contacts in blue. The RNP1 and RNP2 motifs and the secondary structures are shown. Chemical-shift perturbations induced by the binding of RNA to TcUBP1 (NQ) are shown above the sequences. The deviations (in parts per million) were quantified with the formula  ) ((1H)2 + (0.215N)2)1/2, where 1H and 15N are the chemical-shift differences of the amide proton and nitrogen. The side-chain amide groups perturbed during the NMR titration are identified with asterisks. (B) Amide chemical-shift perturbations mapped onto the backbone trace of the TcUBP1 RRM domain.

chain of Arg113. These interactions rationalize the ITC results and explain the large negative enthalpy (H), which arises from the high proportion of hydrogen-bond/electrostatic interactions present in the protein-RNA complex. The negative entropy (S) is due to the reduction in the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the RNA and the protein side chains engaged in complex formation. DISCUSSION As expected from the sequence analysis, a DALI search (49) for protein structures with similar folds identified 11 RRM domains with Z scores above 4.0. The highest Z scores were from Sxl (50), HuD (10), PABP (51), and hnRNP A1 (17) (Figure 6A). The folded part of TcUBP1 exhibits the classical R R topology of the RRM family (for a review, see ref 18), devoid of any extra N- or C-terminal secondarystructure elements as observed in some RBPs, such as the short N-terminal helix in CstF-64 (52) and hnRNP A1 (43), the C-terminal R helix in CstF-64 and U1A (53), the C-terminal strand in the third RRM (RRM3) of the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTB) (54), or the C-terminal strand and a long R helix in the human La protein (55). TcUBP1 does contain an extra -hairpin 4- 5, which increases the width of the -sheet surface and appears to play a role in RNA recognition. This region is very basic and shows significant perturbations upon RNA binding. TcUBP1 is the first protein showing an enhanced contribution of this hairpin (e.g., from the 4 strand). In the crystal structures of HuD RRM1-RRM2 complexed with AUUUUUAUUUU (10) or Sxl RRM1-RRM2 complexed with GUUGUUUUUUUU (50), the RNA does not interact with

this -hairpin loop in the N-terminal RRM1 domain but rather interacts with the sheet of RRM2 (10) (parts A and B of Figure 7). As a result, the -hairpin loops are exposed to the solvent. In TcUBP1, the absence of a second RRM is likely responsible for the enhanced importance of the hairpin in interacting with the RNA (see Figure 7E). Modeling suggests that seven nucleic acid bases are involved in TcUBP1 recognition, while eight bases are usually found to interact with proteins containing two RRMs (10). A second difference observed in the TcUBP1 structure concerns the residues in the RNP1 sequence in the 3 strand, which exhibit smaller chemical-shift perturbations relative to residues in stands 1, 2, and 4. In the HuD/RNA and Sxl/RNA complexes, the bases of Ade7 and Ura8 respectively are both close to the 3 strand even if they make side-chain contacts with a glutamine residue (Gln134 in Sxl and Gln48 in HuD) located after the 1 strand (corresponding to Thr52 in TcUBP1, Figure 6A). The absence of these glutaminemediated interactions in TcUBP1 prevents contact with the RNA, leading to a change in the recognition in this part of the protein. Also worth discussing are the N- and C-terminal residues within the RRM domain. As shown in Figure 6, in known structures, the residues preceding 1 and following 6 make contacts via side- and main-chain atoms with the bound RNA. A similar situation could exist in TcUBP1, but it is not clear to what extent the C-terminal residues interact with the RNA because backbone assignments were not possible for residues His123-Arg125. The large chemical-shift changes observed for the N-terminal residues Asp40 and Val41 suggest a direct interaction with the RNA or significant structural change in the immediate (local) environment.

(C) Model of the complex between TcUBP1 and the RNA 5-GUUUUUGUUUUUG-3. For greater clarity, only protein residues 40-120 and nucleic acid residues 4-10 are shown. (D) Electrostatic potential of the TcUBP1 RRM surface. The surface is color-coded with red indicating negative potential and blue indicating positive potential. (E) Summary of expected contacts between TcUBP1 and the RNA fragment. Thick lines indicate stacking interactions, and dashed lines indicate interactions observed in certain parts of the calculated models. An asterisk is shown for residues making main-chain contacts with the RNA.

In higher eukaryotic RBPs that contain multiple RRM domains, the first and second RRMs are often the most important in term of RNA binding (10, 56). Accessory functions, such as localization, oligomerization, and proteinprotein interaction (57-59), and structural stability (53) have been attributed to the following RRMs. Here, we show that the RNA-binding affinity of TcUBP1 (NQ) is in the micromolar range, which is in agreement with the previous studies of other individual RRMs. The presence of two or more domains is required for higher affinity (48, 60). At present, all of the known RRM/RNA complex structures are from proteins containing at least two RRMs. Relevant previous structural studies of complexes involving U-rich RNA fragments are NMR titration experiments with (i) RRM1 of hnRNP C and a U8 RNA (61), (ii) RRM2 of Sxl and GU8 (62), and (iii) RRM1 and RRM2 of HuC and a AUUUA RNA (60). To our knowledge, TcUBP1 is the first NMR structure of an RRM domain from a lower eukaryotic protein that contains a single RRM domain. Single RRM proteins often contain auxiliary domains that are involved in protein-protein associations. In the case of TcUBP1/2, the Gly-rich auxiliary region was found to be crucial for the dimerization and the variable region was shown to be related to the RNA-binding mode (22). This previous study showed that TcUBP1 can interact in ViVo with

TcUBP2 and that this heterodimer is detected in the cell as a preformed heterodimer that does not bind RNA. The RRM domain of TcUBP2 differs from TcUBP1 only in two residues (Val41 and Cys76 instead of Leu27 and Ala62) and binds RNA with comparable affinity (22). Our structure of TcUBP1 provides a starting point for understanding the precise role of the heterodimerization that occurs between TcUBP1 and TcUBP2 in the destabilization process of TcSMUG RNA.
