° The crystal structures of an anti-morphine antibody 9B1 (to 1.6 A resolution) ° and its complex with morphine (to 2.0 A resolution) are reported. The morphine-binding site is described as a shallow depression on the protein surface, an unusual topology for a high-affinity (Ka , 109 M21) antibody against a small antigen. The polar part of the ligand is exposed to solvent, and the cationic nitrogen atom of the morphine molecule is anchored at the bottom of the binding site by a salt-bridge to a glutamate side-chain. Additional affinity is provided by a double cation ­p interaction with two tryptophan residues. Comparison of the morphine complex with the structure of the free Fab shows that a domain closure occurs upon binding of the ligand.

Introduction
The immune system has the exceptional capability to produce antibodies specific to virtually any antigen. This natural protein engineering is normally directed against alien protein targets, yet if properly presented, even molecules built from barely a dozen atoms can elicit highly specific antibodies. Such systems therefore represent a suitable model for improving our understanding of how proteins bind small ligands. Such an understanding would enhance the ability to engineer antibodies with improved properties for immunotherapeutic applications, as well as being beneficial for structure-based drug design. Indeed, the task of building a protein capable of binding a specific molecule is complementary to

the design of a specific substrate targeted at a site on the protein surface. Here, we present the three-dimensional structures of the Fab fragment of an anti-morphine antibody 9B1 complexed with morphine. The morphine molecule is of compact shape, with a cationic nitrogen atom. On the opposite end of the molecule are three polar oxygen atoms; a hydrophobic belt in the center part of the molecule separates the two polar areas. Our structural study shows that this topology is utilized by the antibody so that the hydrophobic part of the ligand is buried upon binding, whereas the polar top remains exposed to solvent and the cationic charge is anchored at the bottom of the binding site by the combination of a double cation ­ p interaction with two tryptophan residues and a salt-bridge to a glutamate side-chain. Comparison with the structure of the unliganded form of the protein indicates that the binding of the morphine ligand by the antibody 9B1 is essentially a case of lock-and-key recognition, with no large-scale conformational change. We did, however, detect a small closuretype motion of the light chain variable subdomain with respect to its heavy counterpart, as well as rotation of three aromatic side-chains in the binding site.

Anti-morphine Antibody Structure

Results
Overall structure and conformation of CDR loops The overall structure of the Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody 9B1 is shown in Figure 1. The antigen-binding site of an immunoglobulin molecule is located at the tip of the variable domain and is formed by six complementarity determining regions (CDRs). CDRs are numbered according to their position in the sequence and are thus referred to as CDR L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, and H3. Structurally, CDRs are loops, and their conformations usually fall into one of the so-called structural canonical classes.1 CDR loop L1 (residues 25­ 33 of the light chain) has the three residue insertion at position 27 (all the numbering is according to Wu & Kabat.2 It corresponds to the canonical structure 3a. CDR loop L2 (residues 49 ­53) forms a g-hairpin, common in antibodies, with ThrL51 being in a strained conformation. The last light-chain CDR loop, L3 (residues 90 ­ 97), resembles canonical structure 1a. CDR loop H1 (residues 26 ­32 of the heavy chain) adopts canonical structure 1. CDR loop H2 has a Pro insertion at position 52 and adopts canonical structure 2a. The conformation of a torso region of CDR loop H3 is known to hinge on the presence of specific residues at positions 94 and 101. In antibody 9B1, these residues are Arg and Asp, respectively and, in accord with predictions,3 the loop adopts a "bulged torso" conformation. The head region of the loop corresponds to the canonical conformation of a 15 residue CDR loop

H3 (two residue insertion at position 100), showing ° an overall r.m.s.d. of 0.89 A for a-carbon atoms when compared to the representative of this class, derived from the antibody Bv04-01 (PDB code 1NBV). Binding site The morphine-binding site is a conical depression on the protein surface at the tip of the variable domain (see Figure 2). It is substantially hydrophobic and consists of five aromatic (three tryptophan and two tyrosine), three aliphatic (two leucine and one isoleucine) and one polar residue (glutamate). Hydrophobic residues form the walls of the depression, and the only polar side-chain, GluH50, is located at the bottom of the depression. A single water molecule is found in the binding site and it forms hydrogen bonds with the sidechain of TrpH95 and backbone oxygen atom of LeuH97. All of the CDR loops are involved in the formation of the binding-site surface, with the exception of CDR L2. Overall, the contribution of the heavy chain dominates, providing more than twothirds of the surface buried upon binding. The morphine molecule, itself of conical shape, is an excellent topological fit for the binding site. It binds with its cationic nitrogen atom facing the bottom of the binding site and its polar oxygen atoms exposed to the solvent. The hydrophobic belt in the middle of the ligand molecule is thus complementary to the hydrophobic surface of the binding site. The location of the ligand suggests electrostatic

The variable domain, which contains the antigen-binding site, corresponds to the N-terminal part of both chains, and the hinge linking it to the constant domain consists of residues 106­ 109 of the light chain (shown in red) and 112 ­ 115 of the heavy chain (shown in blue). Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are numbered and shown in orange (light chain) and cyan (heavy chain).

complementarity to the binding site. The nitrogen atom of the morphine molecule forms a salt-bridge with the anionic side-chain of GluH50. Also, the cationic ligand is properly positioned in the binding site to provide cation ­p interactions4 with the aromatic side-chains of TrpL91 and TrpH95.

the backbone oxygen atom of LeuH97 and to the third water molecule. The fourth water molecule makes a hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen atom of AsnL94 and to the fifth water molecule. When morphine binds, only the first two water molecules (those making hydrogen bonds to tryptophan residues) are retained. Hydrophobic interactions The binding site of the anti-morphine antibody 9B1 is topologically a depression on the protein surface rather than a pocket. Accordingly, only about 70% of the ligand surface is buried upon binding to the antibody. However, about twothirds of the ligand surface that remains exposed to solvent is actually polar and the burial of the hydrophobic surface of the ligand by the antibody is quite effective (about 85%). Ligand binding bur° ° ies 304 A2 (271 A2 non-polar) of surface area and ° 171 A2 of protein surface area is buried, with 72% of this surface being hydrophobic. Electrostatic complementarity The anionic side-chain of GluH50, located at the bottom of the binding site, forms a salt-bridge to the nitrogen atom of the ligand (O-to-N distance is ° 2.6 A), anchoring it to the binding site. This anchoring side-chain is a part of a hydrogen bonding network that extends from TrpH47 to the nitrogen atom of the ligand (shown in Figure 3). The buried residue, TrpH47, forms a hydrogen ° bond at 2.8 A to GluH35. The geometry of the bond suggests that TrpH47 is the proton donor to this hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen atom of a protonated GluH35, which is located in the immediate vicinity of GluH50, and there is a ° hydrogen bond at 2.5 A between their respective Oe1 atoms. In this pair, planarity considerations ° (Oe1 of GluH35 is about 1.9 A above the plane of the carboxylate group of GluH50, whereas Oe1 of GluH50 is in the plane of the carboxylate group of GluH35) suggest that GluH35 is the proton

Discussion
Binding site composition The surface of the morphine-binding site of the antibody 9B1 consists of nine residues (their properties are listed in Table 2). A total of 58% of the surface consists of aromatic residues, three tryptophan and two tyrosine. Three aliphatic residues (two leucine and one isoleucine) contribute another 24% of the surface, making the binding site largely hydrophobic. The last residue, glutamate, is the only polar residue in the binding site. Three of the five aromatic residues in the binding site are found in positions where the presence of aromatic side-chains is highly conserved among murine antibodies (L32, L91, and H33). Two others (H95 and H100) are at hypervariable positions and are often aromatic. Both leucine residues (L96 and H97) occupy positions at which aromatic sidechains are found frequently. It is clear from the structure that having large aromatic side-chains at these positions would not compromise the protein structure but may preclude binding of the ligand. Isoleucine at position H58 is a very unusual mutation, as this position is occupied most frequently by polar residues, and this substitution is due to the structural role of the residue as a part of the hydrophobic pocket. GluH50 is at a hypervariable position and this anionic residue allows formation of the salt-bridge with cationic ligand. In the apo form, the morphine-binding site contains five water molecules and one tetraethyleneglycol fragment. Two of the water molecules make hydrogen bonds to the side-chains of TrpH33 and TrpH95. The latter also makes a hydrogen bond to

donor. Accordingly, this residue likely possesses a zero net charge and this was taken into account to calculate the surface electrostatic potential, shown in Figure 4. Other antibodies specific to cationic antigens also possess two hydrogen bonded anionic side-chains in the binding site,5 ­ 7 including two recently described anti-cocaine antibodies.8,9 It is not clear if pairing of two anionic side-chains, which precludes deprotonation of one of them, is of any benefit with respect to binding affinity. It should be noted that this structural motif is, in two cases,

involved in water-mediated interactions with ligand, whereas in four others (including 9B1) it provides electrostatic complementarity. However, 9B1 is unique among these six antibodies, because it forms a direct salt-bridge to its cationic ligand. Cation ­ p interactions Cation ­ p interactions stabilize protein structure10 and contribute to protein­ ligand interactions,11 although the magnitude of the contribution to the binding energy is uncertain and may be quite small in some cases. The presence of five aromatic side-chains in the binding site of 9B1 and the cationic nature of its ligand (morphine has pKa , 8:2) makes such an interaction likely. Geometry indicates the presence of two cation­p interactions, with TrpL91 and TrpH95. The distance from the cation to the indole ring center is in both ° cases , 4.4 A, but in the case of TrpL91 the cation is not perfectly positioned above the center of the ring. Contributions to the affinity The binding constant of antibody 9B1 for morphine is , 109 M21, which gives an estimate of the binding free energy as , 12 kcal/mol (1 cal ¼ 4.184 J). The contribution of hydrophobic interactions could account for approximately 8 ­ ° 10 kcal/mol: 394 A2 of the buried apolar surface, assuming a transfer energy of 20 ­ 25 cal mole per ° A2.12 Since the contribution of the salt-bridge formed between the nitrogen atom of the ligand and GluH50 may be close to neutral,13 the cation­ p interactions (whose energetic contribution is estimated to be 3.3(^ 1.5) kcal/mol10 may supply the remainder of the binding free energy. It must be

695 ° experimental precision (kDr2 lLuzzati , 0:2 A, see Table 1), but that the variable domain has ° (kDr2 lbackbone , 0:36 A). This indicates that the variable domain shows small but detectable conformational changes induced by ligand binding. The domain motion analysis using the program DynDom14 revealed that the ligand-induced conformational change that occurs corresponds to a closure-type motion of the light chain variable subdomain with respect to its heavy chain counterpart. For individual subdomains (VL and VH), the backbone r.m.s.d. between the free Fab and its ° complex with morphine is about 0.2 A, indicating that the difference in atomic displacements upon ligand binding between the constant and variable domains is due to this closure motion. The extent of this motion can be calculated by inserting the morphine ligand into the free Fab structure aligned against the liganded form. The consequence of this motion is that the average closest-approach distance between binding site residues listed in ° Table 2 and the ligand decreases from 4.1 A to ° . It must be borne in mind that two structures 3.7 A were obtained under different conditions. However, reduced temperature and increased concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG) are expected to favor a more compact conformation. In fact, the specific volume of the apo form of the protein mol° ecule is , 45 A3 larger that that of the liganded form, whose structure was determined at 4 8C and with lower concentration of PEG. In addition to the concerted motion of the VL and VH domains, there are two noticeable side-chain rearrangements in the binding site. First, the indole ring of TrpL91 rotates almost 1808, bringing the side-chain to the proper position for the cation ­ p interaction with the ligand. The change in position of the aromatic group suggests that the cation ­ p interaction must contribute some favorable binding energy. The adjacent residue, TyrL32, undergoes a smaller (, 358) rotation of its aromatic ring, which

borne in mind that, due to multiple factors contributing to binding energetics, the above analysis is approximate and cannot be justified conclusively on the basis of structural information alone. Ligand-induced conformational changes The comparison of the free Fab with the complex with morphine reveals no major conformational change resulting from binding of the ligand. The ° average r.m.s.d. of the backbone atoms is 0.32 A. This r.m.s.d. cannot be ascribed to the relative movement of the constant and variable domain with respect to one another, since the elbow angle (the angle between axes of pseudo-symmetry of the variable and constant domain) remains unchanged upon ligand binding (1798). Comparison of the constant and variable domains alone between the apo and bound forms shows that the constant domain has not changed conformation ° (kDr2 lbackbone , 0:18 A) within the limits of the

further results in a 158 rotation of the TyrH100. The second side-chain rearrangement is the 208 rotation of the carboxylate group of the GluH50, which has an apparent effect of forming a hydrogen bond with the ligand. The rest of the supporting hydrogen bonding network (GluH35 and TrpH47) also shifts so that the hydrogen bonds are intact. This rotation of the indole ring of TrpL91 results in displacement of two water molecules. In addition, the morphine ligand directly displaces ° one more water molecule (Bwat , 45 A2), as well as what appears to be a tetraethyleneglycol fragment. The water molecules that make hydrogen bonds to TrpH33 and TrpH95 are retained upon ° binding.

of needle-like crystals; the conditions were further refined to obtain 0.2­ 0.3 mm crystals within a week of vapor-diffusion equilibration, with the best conditions determined as 22% (w/v) PEG2000 monomethyl ether (PEGMME2000), 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6). Co-crystals were obtained using a 3:1 excess of morphine sulfate (purchased from Sigma) at the same conditions. The crystals often appeared to be epitaxially twinned. Data collection and processing A single capillary-mounted crystal of the liganded form of Fab of the anti-morphine antibody 9B1 was used for data collection. We used an RU300B rotating anode generator (operating at 38 kV and 24 mA) equipped with an Raxis-IV detector (both from Rigaku). The crystal was kept at 4 8C and did not suffer significant radiation damage during approximately 50 hours of data collection. The diffraction data for the unliganded Fab were collected at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne, IL (beamline 14-BMC), at 110 K using flashfrozen crystals with 40% PEGMME2000 as a cryoprotectant. Crystals were subjected to annealing,16 which improved diffraction quality dramatically, increasing resolution and reducing mosaic spread. DENZO and SCALEPACK17 were used for data processing and statistics are shown in Table 1. Molecular replacement and refinement The structure of the Fab fragment of 9B1 was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe18 from the CCP4 package.19 Structures of 15 Fab fragments were chosen randomly from the Protein Data Bank. Constant and variable domain models were used separately to avoid problems arising from variation in elbow angle between domains.20 All 15 models of the constant domain yielded the same top solution, with the antibody 5C8 providing the best one.21 Three outstanding solutions were obtained with variable domains and that from antibody tAb2 was selected as the best one.22 These two best solutions for the constant and variable domains were then combined to obtain the final solution, which gave an initial R-factor of 48%. The structures of the Fab fragment of anti-morphine antibody 9B1 (called, simply 9B1), both free and complexed with morphine, were refined in CNS.23 After correcting the protein sequence of the solution obtained from molecular replacement, the initial model was subjected to simulated annealing, followed by manual rebuilding, conjugated gradient minimization and grouped B-factor refinement. Clear electron density corresponding to the ligand was found in the binding site of the liganded form of the protein and it was modeled using the crystal structure of morphine obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database. Strong additional difference electron density was found in the binding site of the unliganded Fab, and was interpreted as a polyethylene glycol fragment and a molecule of tetraethylene glycol was built into the electron density. Next, 297 water molecules and two sulfate molecules were added to the final model of the liganded Fab, and 327 water molecules and two sulfate molecules were added to the final model of the unliganded Fab. In the final step of the refinement, B-factors were refined individually. Also, after the model was completed, the bulk solvent mask was corrected as to exclude internal cavities. For the Fab/morphine complex

Conclusions
We report the first structure of an anti-morphine antibody. It demonstrates that a binding site for a relatively small (less than 300 Da) antigen does not necessarily have to be a deep pocket. The topology of the binding site can better be described as a shallow depression; however, it is very effective in burying the non-polar part of the ligand, and leaves the prevalently polar side of it exposed to solvent. Despite a shallow binding pocket, the anti-morphine antibody 9B1 is capable of providing both specificity and relatively high affinity (Ka , 1029 M21) for the morphine ligand. Similar to other antibodies raised against cationic haptens, 9B1 utilizes electrostatic complementarity and cation ­ p interaction to provide specificity towards its antigen.

Materials and Methods
Fab purification and crystallization Monoclonal anti-morphine antibody 9B1 was produced using hybridoma technology. It was subjected to digestion by papain to obtain the Fab fragment.15 Digestion was carried out by incubating a 10 mg/ml solution of the monoclonal antibody (0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.1 M L -cysteine, 1 mM EDTA) with 0.1 mg/ml of papain for four hours at 37 8C. Non-reducing SDSPAGE showed complete limited digestion of IgG under these conditions. The Fab fragment was purified by a combination of size-exclusion (Sephacryl S-200 HR column from Amersham BioSciences (Piscataway, NJ)) and ion-exchange (Bio-Scale Q20 column from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA)) chromatography. Fractions containing pure Fab were pooled and concentrated to , 5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration over a 10 kDa filter. Protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm assuming an extinction coefficient of 1.4 (mg/ ml)21 cm21. Crystallization conditions for the native protein were found using sparse matrix screens from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA) and the hanging-drop method. One of the screen conditions yielded a shower
