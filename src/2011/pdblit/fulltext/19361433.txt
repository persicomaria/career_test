SufC, a cytoplasmic ABC-ATPase, is one of the most conserved Suf proteins. SufC forms a stable complex with SufB and SufD, and the SufBCD complex interacts with other Suf proteins in the Fe­S cluster assembly. We have determined the crystal structure of SufC from Thermus thermophilus ° ° HB8 in nucleotide-free and ADP-Mg-bound states at 1.7 A and 1.9 A resolution, respectively. The overall architecture of the SufC structure is similar to other ABC ATPases structures, but there are several specific motifs in SufC. Three residues following the end of the Walker B motif form a novel 310 helix which is not observed in other ABC ATPases. Due to the novel 310 helix, a conserved glutamate residue involved in ATP hydrolysis is flipped out. Although this unusual conformation is unfavorable for ATP hydrolysis, salt-bridges formed by conserved residues and a strong hydrogen-bonding network around the novel 310 helix suggest that the novel 310 helix of SufC is a rigid conserved motif. Compared to other ABCATPase structures, a significant displacement occurs at a linker region between the ABC a/b domain and the a-helical domain. The linker conformation is stabilized by a hydrophobic interaction between conserved residues around the Q loop. The molecular surfaces of SufC and the C-terminal helices of SufD (PDB code: 1VH4) suggest that the unusual linker conformation conserved among SufC proteins is probably suitable for interacting with SufB and SufD.

Introduction
Fe­S proteins are involved in various cellular processes ranging from electron transfer to transcription regulation.1,2 In vitro, the assembly of Fe­S clusters can occur spontaneously under favorable conditions in which a large amount of free iron and sulfide are provided, but these elements are toxic to cellular processes. In vivo, biosynthesis of Fe­S clusters requires a complex process which involves several specific proteins.1 Three systems, called NIF, ISC and SUF, have been identified as Fe­S cluster assembly machineries. The NIF system is a specific

system involved in the assembly of the metallocluster for the nitrogenase complex.3 The ISC system functions as a housekeeping Fe­S cluster assembly system, and is conserved among bacteria and higher eukaryotes.4,5 The SUF system is identified as a third Fe­S cluster biosynthesis system, and is found in both prokaryotes and higher plant plastids.6,7 Recent studies have shown that the SUF system is activated by OxyR, IHF and Fur, to synthesize Fe­S clusters specifically under conditions of oxidative stress or iron starvation.8,9 The SUF system is composed of the sufABCDSE operon in Escherichia coli, which encodes genes homologous to those encoded in the iscRSUA operon and the nifAUS operon.6,7 SufA has a high level sequence similarity to NifA and IscA, and may function as a scaffold protein for the preassembly of Fe­S clusters.10,11 SufS is highly homologous to IscS and NifS, which functions as a cysteine desulfurase that produces a sulfur atom required for Fe­S assembly by the conversion of 12­14 L-cysteine to L-alanine. IscS and NifS have been

1044 shown to transfer sulfur to IscU and NisU, respectively, and these enzymes function as a Fe­S assembly scaffold protein.15,16 On the other hand, the Suf operon lacks NifU/IscU homologues, but encodes the conserved SufE protein instead. SufE interacts with SufS and enhances its desulfurase activity. A conserved cysteine residue of SufE is essential for activation of SufS, and this residue has been shown to accept a sulfur atom from SufS.17­19 In spite of the lack of sequence similarity, recent crystallographic studies have revealed that the core structure of SufE shows strong structural similarity to that of IscU, indicating that SufE and IscU are homologous in their structure and function.20,21 Additional components of the suf operon are SufB, SufC and SufD. Most of the suf genes are found in various organisms, but the complete suf operon is seldom conserved.22 The most conserved suf genes are sufB and sufC, which are found in eubacteria, archaea, plants and parasites. SufC is probably a key component in the SUF system, because SufC-deficient mutants in Erwinia chrysanthemi exhibit phenotypes sensitive to oxidative stress or iron limitation, as

observed in mutants lacking the suf operon completely.23,24 In Aabidopsis thaliana, the SufC homologue AtNAP7 is essential for embryogenesis.25 SufC has signature sequences typical of ABC ATPases: Walker A, Walker B, and ABC signature motifs. In fact, bacterial SufC shows an ATPase activity in vitro.24,26 ABC ATPases are the nucleotide-binding component of ABC transporters, and interact with a transmembrane component. SufC forms a complex with SufB and SufD, but the SufBCD complex has no transmembrane region, existing in a soluble stable complex.17,24,26 It is reported that the SufBCD complex further enhances the cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS in the presence of SufE.17 This enhancement of SufS does not require ATP hydrolysis by the SufBCD complex. The SufBCD complex may also function, however, in another cluster-building step using the energy from ATP hydrolysis. To obtain the structure of the SufC protein at atomic resolution and characterize its functional nature, we determined, for the first time, the crystal structures of SufC from Thermus thermophilus HB8

in both nucleotide-free and ADP-Mg-bound forms. The structure has revealed an atypical nucleotidebinding conformation at the end of the Walker B motif in SufC. In addition, the surface of SufC has a cleft different from those observed in other ABC ATPase structures. These results suggest that SufC interacts with SufB and SufD in a manner different from that of ABC transporters.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination The complete genome of T. thermophilus HB8 contains three suf genes: sufC, sufB and sufD

(R. Masui, K. Kurokawa, N. Nakagawa, F. Tokunaga, Y. Koyama, T. Shibata, T. Oshima, S. Yokoyama, T. Yasunaga & S. Kuramitsu, unpublished results) Purified SufC from T. thermophilus HB8 exists as a monomer in solution and exhibits an ATPase activity, with a rather low affinity for ATP (KmZ w4 mM; VmaxZw35 mM minK1; kcatZw1.2 minK1) (data not shown). The crystals of SufC belong to the space group P21 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) method using selenomethionine (SeMet)-SufC. The final model ° was refined at 1.7 A resolution to an Rwork value of 19.4% and Rfree of 22.3%. Furthermore, to identify conformational changes in the nucleotide binding, crystals of Mg-ADP-bound SufC were obtained by

1047 ABC ATPases.28,30 These structural features provide unusual conformations of residues involved in the nucleotide binding (Figures 2 and 3). Nucleotide-binding site SufC has the typical motifs of ABC ATPases: Walker A, Walker B, and the ABC signature motifs. The structure of the ADP-Mg-bound SufC shows a detailed view of the interactions between residues of SufC and the nucleotide (Figure 3(a)). The residues of the Walker A motif (Gly36 to Thr44) mainly interact with the nucleotide, as observed in the structures of the nucleotide-bound ABC ATPases (Figure 3(a) and (b)). The main-chain and side-chain atoms of these residues form hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group. Around the b phosphate, there are two strong peaks (peak 1 at 9s, peak 2 at 14s) in the FoK Fc map (Supplementary Data, Figure S1). The peak 1 contacts with the oxygen atoms of the b phosphate and Thr46, and the distances between these atoms ° ° are 2.2 A and 2.5 A, respectively. Peak 2 contacts with the oxygen atom of the b phosphate and the nitrogen atom of Lys42, and the distances between ° ° these atoms are 2.2 A and 2.3 A, respectively. No water molecules exist around both the peaks. The crystallization solutions did not contain any Na ions, but did contain Mg ions (150 mM). Therefore, both peaks were assigned as Mg ions. The Mg ion at the peak 1 (Mg1) is located at a position similar to that observed in other ABC ATPases,30­33 and is essential for ATP hydrolysis.34,35 The Mg ion at the peak 2 (Mg2) is unique to this structure, and its function is unclear. Most of interactions between SufC and ADP are similar to those observed in other ABC ATPase

co-cystallization with ADP. The structure of the Mg° ADP-bound SufC was refined at 1.8 A resolution to an Rwork value of 18.2% and Rfree of 21.9%. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Overall structure The structure of SufC consists of two domains: an ABC a/b domain (residues 1­85 and 162­250) and an a-helical domain (residues 86­161) (Figure 1(a)). The ABC a/b domain contains five a-helices (a1, a2, a6, a7 and a8), two 310 helices (a 0 2 and a 0 3) and two b-sheets (sheet I and sheet II). Sheet I comprises four solvent-exposed antiparallel b strands (b2, b1, b4 and b5), whereas sheet II, surrounded by a-helices, consists of four parallel b-strands (b6, b7, b3 and b8) and one antiparallel b-strand (b9) (Figure 1(a) and (b)). This domain is structurally similar to RecA,27 which has the typical core fold of ABC ATPases.28­31 The conserved ABC ATPase motifs, the Walker A, Walker B, D and H motifs, are included in this domain. The a-helical domain contains three a-helices and one 310 helix. The ABC signature motif is located between the 310 helix a 0 1 and the helix a5. The Q loop forms a part of the linker region between the helices a2 and a3. In the nucleotidefree SufC structure, some residues of the ABC signature motif and the Q loop are disordered. Figure 1(b) shows the topology diagram of the SufC structure. There are two remarkable features in the topology diagram that distinguish SufC from other ABC ATPases. First, three residues (residues 170­ 172) following the end of the Walker B motif form a novel 310 helix (a 0 2) that is not observed in any other ABC ATPase. Second, sheet II lacks one b-strand that is located next to b6 in the structure of other

structures. However, there are several significant differences at conserved residues involved in the nucleotide binding. In other ABC ATPases, the Glu residue of the Walker B motif (Tyr164 to Glu169) is conserved as a platform residue for ATP hydrolysis (Figure 3(b)).36 In some nucleotide-bound structures, this Glu residue interacts with a putative catalytic water molecule.28,33,37 On the other hand, in the structure of SufC, this conserved glutamate residue (Glu169) is flipped out, and is not available for any ligand binding (Figure 3(a)). Instead, the next Thr residue (Thr170) is positioned close to the nucleotide-binding site. Although the conformation of this glutamate residue (Glu169) of SufC is unfavorable for ATP hydrolysis, this unorthodox conformation is stabilized by several interactions around the unique 310 helix a 0 2 (Figure 4). Glu169 and Asp171 form salt-bridges with Lys150. In addition, four water molecules form a strong hydrogen-bonding network with oxygen and nitrogen atoms of residues forming helix a 0 2 (Glu169, Thr170 and Gly173) and residues around the H-motif (Thr200, His201, Try202, and Ile205). These water molecules are observed in the structures of both states of SufC and have low B factors ° (10w15 A2). Furthermore, the residues forming saltbridges (Glu169, Asp171 and Lys150) are conserved among SufC structures (Figure 2). These observations suggest that the unusual 310 helix is a rigid conserved conformation among SufC structures. The novel 310 helix is observed in nucleotide-free and ADP-bound states, but it might not exist in the ATP-bound state. The functional role of the novel 310 helix motif should be elucidated by further studies. The second difference occurs at the interaction with the adenine moiety. In other ABC ATPase structures, an aromatic amino residue stabilizes the nucleotide by a stacking interaction with the

adenine moiety (Phe17 in the case of MJ1267 in Figure 3(b)). According to the sequence alignment analysis of SufC from various organisms, this aromatic residue is replaced by isoleucine or valine in SufC (Figure 2). In the ADP-Mg-bound SufC structure, Ile13 provides a van der Waals contact with the adenine base (Figure 3(a)). Compared to the nucleotide-free structure, a small displacement occurs at the loop region between b1 and b2 (Figure 5). The poor side-chain density of Asp14 in the nucleotide-free and ADP-Mg-bound structures indicates that the loop region is flexible for the nucleotide binding. Unorthodox linker conformation between the ABC a/b domain and the a helical domain In contrast to the ABC a/b domain, the a-helical domain is structurally diverse and involved in the interaction with the transmembrane component of the ABC transporter.38,39 A structural comparison among various states of ABC ATPases has shown that the rotation movement of the a-helical domain to the ABC a/b domain is associated with ATP binding.30 In SufC, the ADP-Mg-bound structure shows a conformation very similar to that of the nucleotide-free structure, with the exception of the loop region between b1 and b2 (root-mean-square ° deviation (rmsd) value of 0.358 A for all Ca atoms). Although the Q loop and the ABC signature motifs are disordered in the nucleotide-free structure, the rotation change of the a-helical domain is not observed between two states as those observed in the structure of the other ABC ATPases.30 One of the major differences that distinguish SufC from other ABC ATPases is the linker region conformation (Gly81 to Phe85) (Figure 6(a)). In other published ABC ATPase structures, an additional b-strand is formed and hydrogen-bonded to the b6

strand of the Walker B motif. The additional b-strand contains residues involved in the interaction with transmembrane subunit in BtuCD.40 In some structures, these hydrogen bonds are partially disrupted due to the rotation of the a-helical domain.29,30 The Q loop Gln residue is conserved

as a putative sensor to the nucleotide binding and is associated with ATP hydrolysis.30 In the structure of SufC, hydrophobic interactions result in a significant displacement of the Ca position of the linker region compared to other ABC ATPase structures (Figure 6(a)). The position of the conserved Q loop

1050 Gln89 is much deviated from those of other ABC ATPases. A significant change occurs at the dihedral angle of Phe83, and there are no hydrogen bonds between residues of the linker region and those of the Walker B motif. Instead, residues of the linker region undergo several hydrophobic interactions with the residues of the helix a3 (Figure 6(b)). These hydrophobic interactions are not observed in other ABC ATPases. The key residue of the hydrophobic interactions is a conserved Phe residue (Phe100) (Figure 2). In the structure of SufC, Phe100, Leu103, Ala104 and Ala107 form a hydrophobic pocket in which Phe86 is stacked. Phe100 also makes a van der Waals contact with Leu140. In addition, Tyr88 interacts with Val92 and Val95. These hydrophobic residues are highly conserved in the SufC proteins (Figure 2). In other ABC ATPases, the conserved Phe residue of SufC is replaced by a highly conserved Asn residue (Figure 2). This Asn residue forms several hydrogen bonds with residues at the termination of the Q loop. Therefore, the conserved Asn residue may function as an anchor to support the shape formed by the Q loop and the a-helix a3. These observations suggest that the unorthodox linker conformation of SufC is not flexible and is specifically conserved among the SufC proteins. The Q loop Gln residue of SufC may have a role different from that of ABC transporters. Implications for the SufBCD complex SufC interacts with SufB and SufD to form a stable complex, and the SufBCD complex probably interacts with other Suf proteins in the Fe­S cluster assembly.17,24,26 However, the functional roles of SufB and SufD remain unclear. In E. coli, SufD has been shown to be required to stabilize the [2Fe­2S] FhuF protein.6 Although the sequence of SufB and SufD are distinct, the C-terminal sequence is conserved between these two (Supplementary Data, Figure S2). Furthermore, the predicted secondary structures of the central and C-terminal region of SufB and SufD are remarkably similar.22 These observations indicate that SufB and SufD are homologous.22 From these results, we propose a model wherein SufD and SufB form a heterodimer, and SufC is expected to interact with the conserved C-terminal residues of SufB and SufD. Nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of ABC transporters and ABC enzymes can form a stable dimer in the ATP-bound states and the structures of NBD homodimers36,37,40­42 and a hetorodimer43 have been recently reported. In this working model, SufC might form a dimer similar to that observed in the other published dimer structures,36,37,40­43 in which the ABC signature motif contacts with the nucleotide bound to the Walker A motif of another subunit. The conserved sequence of the ABC signature motif is LSGGQ,44 whereas that of SufC is FSGGE (Figure 2). In the SufC dimer model based on the ATP-Na-bound MJ079637 (data not shown), the Phe residue of the ABC signature motif contacts the adenine base. Therefore, the first conserved Phe residue of SufC may interact with the adenine base

to increase the affinity to nucleotides in the SufC dimer. The stoichiometry of the SufBCD complex is still unclear,17 but the observation that the activity of ATP hydrolysis of SufC increased in the presence of SufB26 supports this SufBCD complex model. The unorthodox linker conformation in the structure of SufC produces an atypical surface structure around the Q loop. In all published ABC ATPase structures, residues surrounding the Q loop form a cleft. In the BtuCD structure, the L loop of the transmembrane subunit BtuD interacts with residues that form the cleft of the Q loop.40 The L loop has local sequence similarity to the EAA loops of bacterial importers,45 and the fourth intracellular loop (ICL4) of CFTR.46 This L loop may thus be a general motif for interaction with ABC ATPase subunits.40 Therefore, the cleft around the Q loop appears to be a conserved structural feature of ABC ATPases that forms the interface between the nucleotide-binding and transmembrane subunits.40,42 In the structure of SufC, this cleft is disrupted due to the unorthodox linker conformation. This remarkable surface feature suggests that SufC interacts with SufB and SufD in a different manner from that observed in ABC transporters. The recently determined crystal structure of SufD from E. coli (PDB code 1VH4)47 has revealed that the overall structure of SufD consists of a unique b-helical domain and several a-helices. The conserved C-terminal residues form three a­helices. These helices are longer than two helices of the BtuC L loop and their arrangement is distinct from that observed in the BtuC L loop. The molecular surfaces of two proteins were examined to predict the interaction between SufC and the C-terminal helices of SufD (Figure 7). In the SufC structure, the molecular surface around the linker region is hydrophobic and a negatively charged region appeared around a2 helix (Asp75, Glu76) is conserved among SufC proteins. On the other hand, the conserved region of the C-terminal helices of SufD is mostly hydrophobic and partially positively charged around the conserved Arg (Figure 7). The arrangement of these helices is slightly different from each other between two monomers; especially the conformation of the conserved basic Arg residue (Arg378) in the loop region is distinct. Therefore, the available structure of SufD may not display the correct conformation of these helices in the form of the SufCD complex. However, the surface property of the C-terminal helices of SufD seems to be compatible with the surface around the linker region of SufC. This observation implies that the unorthodox surface structure of SufC is suitable for the interaction with the conserved helices of SufB and SufD.

Initial cluster crystals of the SufC protein were obtained by the sitting, drop-vapor, diffusion method at 293 K, by mixing the protein solution with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Tris­HCL (pH 8.6), 24% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 150 mM MgCl2 and 20% (v/v) glycerol in a 1:1 ratio. The initial cluster crystals were used as seeds for microseeding. Crystals suitable for data collection were grown by microseeding in the sitting, drop-vapor, diffusion setup. Drops were made of equal volumes of the protein solution and a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Tris­HCL (pH 8.6), 15% PEG 4000, 150 mM MgCl2, and 20% glycerol. Crystals were taken directly from the drop and flashcooled in a liquid nitrogen stream for data collection. Crystals of SeMet-substituted SufC were obtained under the same conditions as described above. For the ADP complex, the protein solution was incubated overnight at 293 K in the presence of 10 mM ADP before crystallization experiments. Crystals of the nucleotide complex were also grown by co-crystallization under the same conditions. Data collection, structure determination and refinement X-ray diffraction data were collected on the BL44B2 beamline at SPring-8 for the nucleotide-free crystal and on the NW12 beamline at PF-AR for the nucleotide complex crystal. For the SeMet-labeled crystal, data were collected using a selenium peak wavelength (0.9793) of the Se atom on the BL41XU beamline at SPring-8. All data were processed with the HKL suite.48 The structure was determined by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using a SeMetsubstituted dataset. Four sites of the Se atom were determined by SOLVE.49 The phases were calculated with MLPHARE50 and further improved with DM.50 The initial model was built by RESOLVE51 and further manual model building was performed using O.52 Simulated annealing, energy minimization, and individual isotropic B factor refinement were carried out using CNS.53 Cycles of the manual modeling and refinement of CNS were performed; 5% of the total reflections were randomly chosen for the Rfree sets.
