Nucleic acids adopt different multistranded helical architectures to perform various biological functions. Here, we report a crystal structure of an RNA quadruplex containing ``base-tetrad swapping'' and bulged nucleotide at 2.1-Å resolution. The base-tetrad swapping results in a dimer of quadruplexes with an intercalated octaplex fragment at the 5 end junction. The intercalated base tetrads provide the basic repeat unit for constructing a model of intercalated RNA octaplex. The model we obtained shows fundamentally different characteristics from duplex, triplex, and quadruplex. We also observed two different orientations of bulged uridine residues that are related to the interaction with surroundings. This structural evidence reflects the conformational flexibility of bulged nucleotides in RNA quadruplexes and implies the potential roles of bulged nucleotides as recognition and interaction sites in RNA­protein and RNA­RNA interactions.

ucleic acids show great potential in adopting helical structures. In addition to the usual double helices, nucleic acids also can form triple (1) and quadruple helices (2). In DNA, guanine-rich sequences readily form quadruple helices by stacking of guanine base tetrads (2), whereas cytosine-rich sequences adopt the i-motif quadruplex by intercalation of protonated C CH base pairs (2­5). In RNA, four consecutive guanine residues can form quadruplex in both solution (6) and crystalline state (7). NMR study indicated that cytosine-rich RNA sequences also could form the i-motif in solution, even though they are less stable than their DNA counterparts (8). Recently, intercalation of G C and A T base pairs at the junction of two RNA DNA hybrid duplexes formed a fragment of quadruplex (9). Interaction potential with ligands of quadruplex is an important issue in understanding the function of guanine- and cytosine-rich sequences in biological systems, such as telomere and centromere. Recent research has shown the prosperous future of drug designs that target the quadruplexes (10, 11). Crystallographic studies showed that RNA quadruplexes could interact with each other in the 5 terminus (12) and provide specific binding sites both inside and outside of the groove of the quadruplex (13, 14). Quadruplexes also can interlock each other in the slipped termini to extend the helix (15). These studies demonstrate that quadruplex may be a structural motif that is active in interaction in biological systems. Bulges play a crucial role in RNA­RNA and RNA­protein interactions (16). Bulges in double-helical structures have been extensively studied by x-ray crystallography (17­27). However, there is only very limited knowledge about bulges in quadruplex (14). Further research is required to unveil their structural characteristics and biological functions. Here, we report a crystal structure of an RNA oligonucleotide that formed a bulged RNA quadruplex involving ``base-tetrad swapping'' at the 5 end junction, which leads to formation of intercalated octaplex.

crystallized in the tetragonal space group I4122 with eight independent strands in the asymmetry unit. These eight strands form a dimer of two parallel quadruplexes with their 5 end uridine-tetrad (U-tetrad) swapping (Fig. 1a). U4 in the sequence is bulged out, whereas all of the other nucleotides form base tetrads. Despite the eight bulges in the structure, the dimer shows a straight helical axis without any bends or kinks. There are eight K ions in the central axis of the dimer, located between every tetrad plane with the distance in the range of 3.4­3.6 Å. These K ions interact with guanine and uridine, with the average distance of 3.1 Å for O6 (G) and 3.0 Å for the O4 (U). Another two K ions and two Sr ions are associated with the bulged nucleotides. All of the nucleotides are in the anti glycosidic conformation except G2, which is in the syn conformation. All of the guanines adopt the C3 -endo sugar pucker, and U1 and U4 adopt the C4 -exo and U6 adopts the C2 -endo sugar pucker.
Two Different Orientations of U(anti)-Bulge. All of the bulges in the

present structure adopt the looped-out conformation. Superimposition of the seven strands (the bulge in strand 7 is disordered and could not be located) without the U4 nucleotide shows that U4 adopts two different orientations (type I and type II) (Fig. 2a). Type I bulges stand out of the surface of the groove, whereas type II bulges lie on the surface, with their base planes nearly 90° to each other. The two types of bulges belong to the ``standingout'' conformation with their Watson­Crick edge facing outwards and the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) donors and acceptors are readily accessible for interaction (14). Table 1 gives the torsion angles of the bulged nucleotides, together with the previously observed U(syn) bulge for comparison (14). The torsions in both type I and II bulges are different from the g trans for U(syn) and g g for the nucleotides in the usual A-RNA duplex. An extensive examination of the two types of bulges reveals that their orientations are closely related to the unusual crystal packing (Fig. 2b), which is different from the pseudocontinuous head-to-tail (14) and head-to-head tail-to-tail pattern (7, 12, 13, 28, 29). For the type I bulges, two have H-bonding interactions with phosphate groups or sugars of neighboring molecules. Another two stack with their symmetry-related bulges. For the

and O3 (U6), O2P(U4) and O2 (U6). The average distance of P­O3 and P­O2 decreases from 6.6 and 6.0 Å in type I to 4.1 Å in type II. Such shortening in the distance of two negatively charged groups creates a preferred binding pocket for metal ions. A metal ion is associated with each type II bulge and strongly interacts with the O2P, O3 , and O2 atoms. However, no metal ions have been observed for any type I bulges. It should be noted that the intrastrand P­P distance around the bulged nucleotide is similar to all of the bulges (5.2 Å for type I and 5.0 Å for type II, which is much shorter than the average value of 6.5 Å for other base steps), but only bulges of type II are associated with metal ions. Structural studies have already shown that bulges in RNA duplexes can adopt a wide variety of arrangements (16). Until the present, we observed eight U-bulges in quadruplexes, with seven in the anti glycosidic conformation in the present structure and one in the syn conformation (14). All of them adopt the standing-out conformation in which the bulges loop out of the quadruplex and expose the Watson­Crick edge to be available for interaction even at the cost of adopting the less favorable syn glycosidic conformation (14). Bulges in quadruplex can participate in not only H-bonding interaction but also stacking interaction, showing great flexibility in interaction by adjusting their conformations and orientations. These results imply that the bulges are potent recognition and binding sites in quadruplex.
U-Tetrads. Both the 5 and the 3 terminal uridine residues form

type II bulges, two stack with the 3 U-tetrad and another one stacks with the sugar rings of its symmetry-related bulge that lies between two other quadruplexes. The interactions in type I do not constrain the orientation of the bulged nucleotides. Comparatively, the interactions in the type II force the bulged nucleotides to be parallel to the quadruplex (rotation of 90° relative to the type I bulges) and lie on the surface of the groove. Even though the rotation does not change very much the intrastrand phosphate­phosphate (P­P) distances for type II bulges, it decreases greatly the distance between the O2P(U4)

base tetrads. However, they adopt different conformations. The 3 terminal uridine residues form a buckled U-tetrad with one cyclic H-bond of N3 . . . O4 (average bond length of 2.9 Å) (Fig. 3a), similar to the observation in NMR (6) and crystal structures (7, 12, 13). The tetrad plane is tilted 20° toward the K ion because of the interaction between O4 and K ion (2.8 Å). The average C1 ­C1 distance for the neighboring residues is 10.2 Å. The 5 terminal U-tetrads are planar and have only three base­base H-bonds (N3 . . . O4 with the average bond length of 2.9 Å) (Fig. 3b). The usual cyclic H-bond fashion observed in base tetrads does not exist in the base tetrad. Accordingly, the C1 ­C1 distance for these two neighboring residues is 12.9 Å, much longer than the average distance of 10.2 Å for the three corresponding C1 ­C1 distances in the base tetrad. The missing base­base H-bond is compensated with a water bridge. Another water bridge is also observed between O2 and O5 atoms. Even though pyrimidine is smaller in size than purine, pyrimidine can still form base tetrad inside guanine-tetrads (G-tetrads) at the cost of breaking the cyclic H-bonding pattern.
G-Tetrads. All of the guanine residues form base tetrad, which is

associated with a K ion on each side of the tetrad plane. G2 forms the G(syn)-tetrad conformation with two cyclic H-bonds: N1 . . . O6 (3.0 Å) and N2 . . . N7 (3.1 Å) (Fig. 3c). N2 is hydrated with a water molecule. Both G3 and G5 form the usual G(anti)tetrad conformation. However, the hydration pattern in the minor groove is different, which may be due to the buckling of the 3 terminal U-tetrad. A water bridge connects N2, N3, and O2P atoms in a G3 tetrad (Fig. 3d), and a water bridge only connects N3 and O2 atoms in a G5 tetrad (data not shown).

terminal U-tetrads swap in the 5 junction of two adjacent quadruplexes, thus forming a dimer of quadruplexes (Fig. 1a). The rise for the U1­G2 step is 7.3 Å, nearly doubling the average value for all of the other base steps (3.8 Å) in the quadruplex, whereas the twist for the step is 22°, which is also greater than that for the other steps (15°). The intercalation does not increase base overlap for the base tetrad (Fig. 4), which is different from the base pair swapping in duplex structure (9). The backbone torsion angles of the U1­G2 step of the eight strands are shown

that are greatly different from those in the usual A-RNA

in Table 1. It is clear from the table that the major differences from the usual A-RNA duplex mainly come from the torsion angles , , , and of G2. This result is also different from the

base pair swapping in RNA DNA hybrid duplex in which the difference lies in the torsion angles of and (9). Base-tetrad swapping observed in the present structure provides a previously undescribed way of dimerization in RNA quadruplex. This dimerization mode does not change the global conformation of the quadruplex or induce any bends or kinks in the helix. Dimerization of RNA quadruplex also can be achieved by groove-binding interaction in which G­U and A­U base octads are formed (7, 12). In all these cases, the 5 terminal nucleotides are always involved in dimerization, whereas the 3 terminal nucleotides form base tetrads inside the quadruplex. This result indicates the asymmetric behavior of the 5 and the 3 end nucleotides in parallel RNA quadruplex in interaction with ligands.

formation of an octaplex fragment in the junction of two quadruplexes, with eight strands in the alternating antiparallel arrangement (Fig. 1a). The fragment is composed of four layers of base tetrads, two U-tetrads and two G-tetrads. Similar results have been reported in the DNA octamer d(GCGAGAGC) (30). The DNA molecule displays an unusual assembly of four intercalated duplexes, in which the central two nucleotides (underlined in the sequence) are engaged in formation of octaplex at the center of the structure. Combining the observations that octaplex fragments occur in both the terminus and the center of a helical structure, we propose that intercalation may lead to formation of a complete octaplex. The fragment of r(UG)8 (the subscript is the number of strands) in the present structure provides the basic repeat unit of an RNA intercalated octaplex. The r(UG)8 can be visualized

octaplex. The length of the octaplex can be extended by repeat translating 7.3 Å and rotating 22° of the r(UG)4 unit along the central axis of octaplex. This manually built structure is then refined by energy minimization in the program package CNS (31). Fig. 1b shows a model of octaplex r(UGUG)8. The model clearly shows narrowness of the grooves. The shortest P­P distances across the groove are 5.4 Å for narrow groove and 9.4 Å for wide groove, which is much less than that for the wide groove in the i-motif DNA quadruplex (4, 32). The width of the grooves prohibits octaplex from interaction with ligands in the groove (33). In other words, the i-motif RNA octaplex may not have interaction with proteins, nucleic acids, and drug molecules in the grooves. By comparison, grooves are important interaction sites for duplex, triplex, and quadruplex. This important feature implies that octaplex may play a completely different biological role from all known helical structures we have found so far. Indeed, we have very limited knowledge about the structure of octaplex and its biological relevance. The model we propose here only serves as a starting point for the structural study of this previously undescribed member in the helical repertoire.

independent strand in the crystal structure of r(UGUGGU), where U3 nucleotide is in the bulge conformation and adopts the syn glycosidic conformation (14). In the present structure, eight independent strands with U4(anti) in bulge conformation were observed. The glycosidic conformation of the bulged nucleotides largely depends on their interaction with surroundings. The bulges in the two structures also show different behaviors in interaction with metal ions. Combining the results in two structures, we may conclude that one uridine nucleotide embedded in three guanine nucleotides always adopts the bulge conformation in crystalline state, irrelevant to its position inside the guanines. Despite great different conformations of the bulges in the two structures, the global conformation of the G-quadruplex is essentially the same, reflecting the extreme

stability of the G-quadruplex. These results provide structural implications that the pyrimidine nucleotides embedded in the consecutive guanine nucleotides are important in interaction with other molecules, whereas the guanine nucleotides may mainly play structural roles in biological processes. Materials and Methods
Synthesis and Crystallization. The RNA DNA chimera r(U)(BrdG)r(GUGU) was synthesized by the phosphoramidite method using Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer 391. The oligonucleotide was deprotected and purified with ion-exchange chromatography as described in ref. 34. Crystallization was carried out by using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at room temperature. The best crystals were obtained in the following conditions: 1 mM (single strand) oligonucleotide, 32 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5), 40 mM KCl, 30 mM SrCl2, 32 mM MgCl2, 1.6 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride, and 6%(vol vol) methy-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) against 30% MPD in the reservoir. Crystals were usually obtained in several days. Data Collection and Structure Analysis. Three-wavelength data

The electron density maps generated by SOLVE and RESOLVE (36) clearly showed the structure of the tetraplex. The program O was used for model building and fitting (37). The data set 0.9197 Å) was collected at the bromine peak wavelength ( used in the refinement. The torsion angle simulated annealing with slow cooling in CNS (31) was used to refine the model built by manual fitting. Subsequently, iterative positional and B-factor refinements were performed in the resolution range of 19.3­2.1 Å, dropping the Rwork Rfree to 25.2 29.6%. The water molecules were added to the structure according to the electron density maps of 2Fo Fc at 1 and Fo Fc at 3 contour. Metal ions were identified from the high-density profile at the Fo Fc map and were further verified by their B-factor behavior. The final Rwork Rfree is 17.8 22.8%. The crystal data, SAD phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. The atomic coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID code 2AWE) (38).
