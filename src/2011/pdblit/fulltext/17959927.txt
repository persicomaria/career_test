ABSTRACT The Sm and Sm-like proteins are conserved in all three domains of life and have emerged as important players in many different RNA-processing reactions. Their proposed role is to mediate RNA­RNA and/or RNA­protein interactions. In marked contrast to eukaryotes, bacteria appear to contain only one distinct Sm-like protein belonging to the Hfq family of proteins. Similarly, there are generally only one or two subtypes of Sm-related proteins in archaea, but at least one archaeon, Methanococcus jannaschii, encodes a protein that is related to Hfq. This archaeon does not contain any gene encoding a conventional archaeal Sm-type protein, suggesting that Hfq proteins and archaeal Sm-homologs can complement each other functionally. Here, we report the ° functional characterization of M. jannaschii Hfq and its crystal structure at 2.5 A resolution. The protein forms a hexameric ring. The monomer fold, as well as the overall structure of the complex is similar to that found for the bacterial Hfq proteins. However, clear differences are seen in the charge distribution on the distal face of the ring, which is unusually negative in M. jannaschii Hfq. Moreover, owing to a very short N-terminal a-helix, the overall diameter of the archaeal Hfq hexamer is significantly smaller than its bacterial counterparts. Functional analysis reveals that Escherichia coli and M. jannaschii Hfqs display very similar biochemical and biological properties. It thus appears that the archaeal and bacterial Hfq proteins are largely functionally interchangeable.

INTRODUCTION Sm and Sm-like (Lsm) proteins represent a large family of structurally and functionally related proteins of ancient origin. The proteins are ubiquitous in eukaryotes (>18 paralogs) and have the capacity to form at least six different hetero-heptameric ring-shaped complexes that participate in numerous RNA-processing reactions through their association with U-rich target RNAs (for review, see Wilusz and Wilusz 2005). The particular combination of the eukaryotic Sm/Lsm proteins present in a given complex determines its localization as well as the RNA specificity of the complex. Archaeal genomes usually encode either a

single or a few small Sm-related proteins. These form homo-hexameric or homo-heptameric rings and share oligomerization behavior and RNA-binding properties with their eukaryotic counterparts (for reviews, see Pannone and Wolin 2000; Beggs 2005; Khusial et al. 2005; Wilusz and Wilusz 2005). The function of the archaeal proteins is currently not clear. However, the Archaeoglobus fulgidus Sm1- and Sm2-type proteins have been shown to associate with RNase P, suggesting a role in post-transcriptional ¨ ¨ processing of rRNA and tRNA (Toro et al. 2001). More recently, it has been shown that bacterial Hfq proteins are homologs of the eukaryotic Lsm proteins (Møller et al. 2002a; Zhang et al. 2002). Hfq monomers assemble to form highly stable hexamers, which have a binding preference for A/U-rich tracks on the target RNA (Senear and Steitz 1976; de Haseth and Uhlenbeck 1980). The protein has emerged as a pleitropic post-transcriptional regulator that modulates the turnover and/or the translation of a large number of mRNAs (Muffler et al. 1997; Nogueira and 2213

In line with this, Hfq has been shown to schii protein sequence (Mja-Hfq) with the Hfq proteins interact with numerous small trans-encoded regulatory from S. aureus and E. coli indicates that Mja-Hfq consists RNAs (sRNA) that act by base-pairing with target mRNAs. of an isolated Sm domain without the flanking C-terminal Hfq has been shown to be absolutely required for the region found in many of the bacterial proteins (Fig. 1).

One role of Hfq in removed without affecting the activity of the protein (Tsui this context is to protect the sRNAs against degradation. In et al. 1994; Sonnleitner et al. 2002). Within the Sm domain, addition, Hfq strongly promotes the intermolecular base Mja-Hfq bears a conserved ``Hfq Sm2 motif'' (FKHAI) and pairing of sRNAs to their target mRNAs, thereby enabling the loop residues that form the A/U-binding pockets in regulation of translation and mRNA stability (Møller et al. S. aureus Hfq are also well conserved in the archaeal pro2002a; Zhang et al. 2002; Kawamoto et al. 2006). Thus, tein (Schumacher et al. 2002). Collectively, these findthe bacterial Hfq system possesses striking similarities in ings suggest that an Hfq-like protein may be capable of both structure and function to the eukaryotic Lsm proteins functionally replacing an archaeal Lsm protein.

M. jannaschii protein could further the understanding of Members of the Sm/Lsm family possess a common Lsm function in Archaea. To this end, we have undertaken bipartite motif (z70 amino acid residues) consisting of a structural and functional analysis of the Mja-Hfq protein. two relatively conserved regions termed the Sm1 and Sm2 ° We here report its crystal structure at 2.5 A resolution and motifs. These motifs are separated by a region, which is not provide evidence that archaeal and bacterial Hfqs have a conserved in its sequence or length, the variable region ´ number of biochemical and biological properties in com(Cooper et al. 1995; Hermann et al. 1995; Seraphin 1995). mon. Specifically, we show that Mja-Hfq binds efficiently Crystal structures of several eukaryotic and archaeal Sm/Lsm proteins have established that the conserved signature sequence defines a specific Sm-fold composed of a strongly bent five-stranded, antiparallel b-sheet capped by an N-terminal a-helix (Kambach et al. 1999; Collins et al. ¨ ¨ 2001; Mura et al. 2001, 2003; Toro et al. 2001, 2002; Thore et al. 2003; Kilic et al. 2005). Though bacterial Hfq proteins only exhibit faint sequence similarity to the Sm family of proteins, crystal structures of the Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa homologs (Sau-, Eco-, and Pae-Hfq) have revealed that the protein does indeed contain the distinctive Sm fold (Schumacher et al. 2002; Sauter et al. 2003; Nikulin et al. 2005). Moreover, insight into the RNA-binding mechanism of both the archaeal Sm-like proteins and bacterial Hfq has FIGURE 1. Hfq sequence alignment.

to E. coli sRNAs and that the protein possesses the ability to promote intermolecular base-pairing. In addition, Mja-Hfq promotes translation of the general stress sigma factor sS in E. coli and can complement, at least partially, a number of phenotypes displayed by an E. coli hfq knockout strain. RESULTS Expression, isolation, and crystallization of Mja-Hfq The Mja-Hfq protein was overexpressed in E. coli as an N-terminal chitin­intein fusion and purified to homogeneity after on-column removal of the affinity tag. When expressed in a wild-type strain it was found that the endogenous Eco-Hfq copurified with the archaeal protein. Consequently, the Mja-Hfq protein was overexpressed in an E. coli Dhfq strain. The purified protein readily yielded crystals belonging to ° the space group P21 diffracting to at least 2.5 A resolution. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the hexamer from the P. aeruginosa Hfq structure as a search model. The single significant solution that resulted from this calculation revealed that Mja-Hfq possesses the Sm-fold and forms a hexameric ring like its bacterial orthologs (Fig. 2A). There are two hexamers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (ASU), and the 12 subunits are very similar with a root-mean-square deviation

The maximum diameters of the two rings, 54 A ° and 62 A, respectively, are indicated. (B) Superposition of all 12 monomers of Mja-Hfq present in the ASU.

° (RMSD) <0.7 A for all corresponding Ca atoms (Fig. 2B). The two hexamers in the ASU are arranged side-by-side and rotated 45° relative to each other, thereby producing a fairly open packing (Supplemental Fig. 1; http://www. bioxray.au.dk/zdeb/downloads/suppmat/Nielsen_et_al_2007_ Suppl_Fig_1.pdf). Pairwise comparison of the backbone fold of Mja-Hfq with the previously determined bacterial Hfq structures illustrates the close structural homology between the archaeal and the bacterial proteins (Fig. 2C). Significant structural differences between the archaeal and the bacterial Hfqs are restricted to the N-terminal ahelix, the variable L4 loop, and the C terminus. Specifically, the N-terminal a-helix is much shorter in Mja-Hfq, reducing it to a single-turn 3(10) helix, which in the superimposition is placed between the first and second turn of the a-helix in the bacterial Hfq proteins (Fig. 2C). This structural difference stretches the loop following the helix, which is placed much closer to the b-sheet in M. jannaschii than seen in the structures of the bacterial Hfq proteins. Consequently, the overall diameter of the hexameric Mja-Hfq ring is significantly smaller than its ° ° orthologs in bacteria (54 A versus 62 A) (Fig. 2A). Another structural property that sets Mja-Hfq apart from the bacterial counterparts is the charge distribution on the distal face of the ring (i.e., the face not containing the basebinding pockets), which is predominantly negative in MjaHfq (Fig. 3A, right) and positive in the Hfq structures of Eco-Hfq and Pae-Hfq (Fig. 3A; Sauter et al. 2003; Nikulin et al. 2005; Brennan and Link 2007). However, a positively charged distal face is not a common feature of all bacterial Hfq structures determined so far, e.g., in Sau-Hfq, where this face is predominantly nonpolar (Schumacher et al. 2002). Mapping the phylogenetic conservation of Hfq residues onto the Mja-Hfq hexamer structure shows that most of the conserved residues cluster around the cationic pore region and the rim of the proximal face (Fig. 3B). Evidence that several of these conserved residues are involved in RNA binding is provided from previous work (for review, see Brennan and Link 2007). First, residues that participate in forming the A/U nucleotide-binding pockets in the SauHfq-(AU5G) crystal structure spiral around the pore on the proximal surface. Second, mutational analyses of Eco-Hfq indicate that additional conserved residues on the proximal face are involved in RNA binding. Specifically, Hfq point mutations at Lys3 or Arg17 result in a protein that cannot support Qb replication, and residue Arg16 has been implicated in binding of the regulatory DsrA RNA (Brescia et al. 2003; Sonnleitner et al. 2004; Sun and Wartell 2006). In addition, data from mutational analyses indicate the presence of another binding site on the distal face of the Eco-Hfq hexamer that specifically recognizes poly(A) RNA (Mikulecky et al. 2004; Sun and Wartell 2006). Consistently, substitution of Tyr25, Ile30, or Lys31 by alanine strongly reduced the affinity of Hfq for a 27-nucleotide (nt)

synthetic poly(A) oligomer. Based on the similarities in sequence and structure, it is likely that Mja-Hfq possesses cognate sites for RNA binding on the proximal face, while the poly(A)-binding site on the distal face may not be retained in the archaeal protein. For example, the structural counterpart of the poly(A)-binding residues Ile30 and Lys31 in E. coli Hfq are Glu36 and Val37 in Mja-Hfq (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the very acidic nature of this face of the Mja-Hfq hexamer would disfavor RNA binding. Functional analysis of Mja-Hfq To investigate whether archaeal and bacterial Hfq also display the same biochemical and biological properties, we 2216

carried out a number of in vitro and in vivo experiments. First, we examined the RNA-binding properties of the purified Mja-Hfq protein complex by testing its binding to three well-studied small RNA regulators, Spot 42, DsrA, and MicA, as well as to a less-characterized sRNA, HbrC (Møller et al. 2002a; Brescia et al. 2003; Lease and Woodson 2004; Mikulecky et al. 2004; Rasmussen et al. 2005; Udekwu et al. 2005; Sun and Wartell 2006; P. Valentin-Hansen, unpubl.). Samples containing a fixed amount of 32P-labeled sRNA, a 500-fold excess of tRNA, and increasing amounts of Mja-Hfq protein were incubated, and complex formation was analyzed by electrophorectic mobility shift assays (Fig. 4A). The results show that the Mja-Hfq protein is capable of interacting with the sRNAs in a manner very similar to that reported for Eco-Hfq (Møller et al. 2002a; Brescia et al. 2003; Rasmussen et al. 2005); however, its affinity for the sRNAs was slightly lower (two- to sixfold) than that of the bacterial protein (data not shown). Next, we investigated whether Mja-Hfq possesses the ability to form stable ternary complexes with RNAs that function through base pairing. For this we used Spot 42 RNA, which binds to the galK and sucC translational regions of the gal- and suc-operon transcripts, respectively, in a Hfqdependent manner (Møller et al. 2002b; C. Udesen and P. Valentin-Hansen, unpubl.). The results of the interaction studies with Spot 42 and sucC RNA are presented in Figure 4B. When a constant amount of radiolabeled Spot 42 RNA was incubated with 10-, 50-, and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled sucC-RNA, no complex formation was observed. Addition of either Mja-Hfq or Eco-Hfq, however, efficiently triggered formation of Spot 42-Hfq-sucC complexes. For Mja-Hfq, the addition of sucC-RNA resulted in unbound Spot 42 RNA as well (Fig. 4B). The reason for this is not clear, but RNA pairing could potentially destabilize the protein­RNA interactions in the case of Mja-Hfq, which binds less efficiently to the RNAs, leading to release of the RNA. Apart from this disparity in binding behavior, the results clearly show that the archaeal protein is capable of forming ternary Hfq:mRNA:sRNA complexes. In order to study the function of the Mja-Hfq protein in vivo, we generated a low-copy-number plasmid, pNDMhfqMja, expressing the M. jannaschii hfq gene under the control of the inducible lac promoter derivative, PA1/O4 (Lanzer and Bujard 1988). The competence of Mja-Hfq to support stabilization of sRNA was tested in rifampicin runoff experiments in IPTG-induced, exponentially grown E. coli hfq1Tkan cells carrying pNDM-hfqMja or the empty vector pNDM-220 (Gotfredsen and Gerdes 1998). The results for Spot 42 RNA are presented in Figure 5A and show that the presence of Mja-Hfq significantly increased the lifetime of the sRNA (approximately eightfold). Taken together with the in vitro results (Fig. 4A), this finding strongly indicates that the archaeal protein binds to Spot 42 RNA in vivo, thereby protecting the regulatory RNA against cleavage by endonucleases.

The growth curves of the wild-type and the hfq1Tkan mutant carrying pNDM220, pNDMhfqEco, or pNDMhfqMja, respectively, in LB medium supplemented with IPTG are presented in Figure 6A. In accordance with previous work, the growth rate, as well as the optical densities at stationary phase, were reduced for the hfq mutant strain compared with the wild type (Tsui et al. 1994). As would be expected, these growth defects could be restored upon ectopic expression of E. coli Hfq. Also, expression of Mja-Hfq restored the stationary growth defect (final yield) of the mutant strain; however, the growth rate of the mutant was not affected by the presence of the archaeal protein. The phenotype studies further revealed that FIGURE 4. RNA-binding by Mja-Hfq in vitro.

Translation of the rpoS mRNA is known participate in sRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA turnto be dramatically decreased in cells lacking Hfq, and so over in E. coli. To address this question, we investigated far, three Hfq-binding regulatory RNAs--DsrA, OxyS, and regulation by the RyhB RNA, which down-regulates the RprA--have emerged as key regulators of rpoS translation synthesis of a set of iron proteins by destabilizing their (Brown and Elliott 1996; Muffler et al. 1996; for review, see mRNAs. The transcription of RyhB RNA is controlled Repoila et al. 2003). These findings together with the results negatively by the ferric uptake repressor (Fur) protein that of Figure 6, B and C, suggest that Mja-Hfq is capable of acts with ferrous iron as cofactor, and therefore is inactive promoting translation of the alternative s-factor.

DISCUSSION Prokaryotic genomes encode a single or a maximum of three Sm-related proteins. Structural and biochemical studies of several of these proteins have provided general insight into the oligomerization behavior and RNA-binding properties of Sm-like proteins. At present, the best-studied system is Eco-Hfq and the best-characterized function of this protein is its role in mediating post-transcriptional effects of small regulatory RNAs. In contrast, we have very little information regarding the in vivo functions of the Sm-related proteins in Archaea. Here, we report the crystal structure and functional characterization of an Hfq ortholog from M. jannaschii, which is the first, and thus far, only archaeal species found to contain an hfq gene. Our structure of the M. jannaschii protein reveals that each of its polypeptide chains adopts a fold essentially identical to that observed for its bacterial counterpart, a curved five-stranded b-sheet capped by an N-terminal a-helix and separated by a very short ``variable region'' (loop 4). In this regard, it is of interest that two of the most conserved residues amongst Hfq and Sm proteins, a glycine 2218

The overall structure of the Mja-Hfq hexamer is also very Specifically, it was established that the destabilization of the similar to its orthologs in bacteria. This reinforces the sodB message is dependent on the C-terminal domain of suggestion that formation of hexameric rings is a hallmark RNase E, known to be responsible for the assembly of a of the Hfq family of proteins. However, the N-terminal general RNA decay machinery, called the RNA degradoa-helix of the archaeal protein is significantly shorter than some. Moreover, RyhB-mediated mRNA degradation was seen in bacteria, containing just a single 3(10)-type turn found to be coupled to turnover of the regulatory RNA. in contrast to the three regular a-helical turns seen in the These results led to the suggestion that formation of RyhB­ bacterial proteins. This affects the location of the a-helix, mRNA complex could promote RNA degradation by which in the Mja-Hfq structure is situated solely on the recruiting RNase E or the degradosome to the message proximal side of the hexamer, while being both on the top ´ (for review, see Carpousis 2003; Masse et al. 2003). Indeed, and on the side of the complex in the bacterial structures. recent studies by Aiba and coworkers have provided Consequently, the overall diameter of the archaeal ring is not experimental evidence for such a model by showing that defined by the extent of the a-helix, but by the loops of the RNase E interacts directly with Hfq, as well as with Hfq b-sheet and, therefore, is significantly smaller. The crystalbound to small RNAs, via its C-terminal scaffold region, lographic data further demonstrate that the contacts between and these complexes are clearly distinct from those formed monomers are essentially identical to those observed for by the degradosome components (Morita et al. 2005). Eco-Hfq. In fact, the monomers of Eco-Hfq and Mja-Hfq Taken together, the studies imply that formation of a can associate with each to form hetero-hexamers when Mjaspecialized nucleoprotein complex, wherein Hfq acts as Hfq is expressed in wild-type E. coli. In addition, the loop an adaptor between RNase E and RyhB, is required for residues that form the A/U-binding pockets in the S. aureus rapid turnover of the sodB mRNA (Aiba 2007). Moreover, Hfq-AU5G complex structure are conserved in the Mja-Hfq the ability of Mja-Hfq to promote RyhB regulation indiprotein, indicating that an equivalent binding site is likely cates that it possesses the properties of a chaperone very to be present in M. jannaschii. This assumption is fully similar to that of Eco-Hfq. In this context, E. coli Hfq has consistent with our in vitro and in vivo experiments, been shown to promote intermolecular annealing of RyhB demonstrating that Mja-Hfq and Eco-Hfq have similar and the sodB mRNA by altering the folding of the mRNA properties with respect to sRNA and mRNA binding.

observed in E. coli hfq knockout strains that are dependent on the general stress s factor, sS. In agreement with this, we found that Mja-Hfq is capable of promoting translation of the rpoS mRNA. However, our studies of cell growth reveal that the archaeal protein does not fully complement the growth defects of the E. coli hfq1 strain. In summary, we have shown here that the Hfq protein of the archaeon M. jannaschii is structurally and functionally closely related to bacterial Hfq. Specific areas in which parallels can be drawn between the archaeal protein and the E. coli Hfq include binding specificity, chaperone activity, protein­protein interaction, and the ability to promote RNA­RNA interactions. Furthermore, the archaeal Hfq is capable of modulating translation and facilitating small RNA function in E. coli. It therefore seems probable that Mja-Hfq plays a role in vivo that is comparable to that of E. coli Hfq. In addition, the absence of an Lsm gene in M. jannaschii may be indicative of related functions for archaeal Hfq and Lsm proteins. Currently, the exact evolutionary relationship between Hfq and Sm-like proteins is not clear, but it is believed that archaea and eukaryotes evolved from a common predecessor that diverted from the bacterial domain (Woese et al. 1990). In keeping with this view, the Sm domains of archaea and eukaryotes are homologous at both the sequence and structural levels, and the proteins possess similar RNA-binding properties and oligomerization behavior. In contrast, Hfq has a divergent sequence compared with the eukaryotic and archaeal Sm/Lsm proteins. Moreover, Hfq possesses a relaxed RNA-binding specificity that enables it to participate in many stages of RNA metabolism. Therefore, Hfq may represent an ancient, lessspecialized form of the Sm family of proteins.

Plasmid pNDMHfqMja was constructed by replacing the EcoRI­BamHI fragment of pNDM220 (Gotfredsen and Gerdes 1998) with a PCR-generated fragment, prepared using P4-pNDM-Bam (59-CGGGATCCAAAG GAGGAATTAACTATGAACAAGCCTGTGAAGAAACAGCAACC39) and P4-pNDM-rev (59-CGGAATTCTTAGTATTCAATATAGT CTATTGCATGTTT) as primers and plasmid pTYB11-hfqMja as template, followed by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI.

Protein purification
The E. coli Hfq protein was purified as described (Møller et al. 2002a). The full-length M. jannaschii Hfq protein was overexpressed in an E. coli Dhfq derivative of the ER2566 strain and purified using the intein system (Impact-CN TM, New England Biolabs). Cells were grown at 25°C in 2x YT medium containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin. At an OD600 of z0.6, induction was triggered by addition of 0.4 mM IPTG for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using a French press. Following centrifugation, protein purification was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations for the intein system (New England Biolabs). The lysis and wash buffers contained 20 mM Na-HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.5 M or 0.8 M NaCl, respectively. On-column cleavage of the intein-fusion tag was carried out for 2 d at room temperature using a lysis buffer containing 50 mM DTT. The eluted Mja-Hfq protein was precipitated by adding ammonium sulphate to 60% saturation.

Crystallization, data collection, and processing
Prior to crystallization, the protein sample was run on a Superdex 200 100/30 GL gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) to remove any aggregates and exchange the protein into crystallization buffer (20 mM Na-HEPES at pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM bmercaptoethanol). Monodisperse fractions were pooled and concentrated in a VivaSpin 500 mL spin filter (30.000 MWCO, Viva Sciences) to a final concentration of 8 mg/mL as measured by OD280 absorption (e0 = 2 mg/mL*OD280). Crystallization screens were set up using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method by mixing protein solution with reservoir in 2:1 volume ratios. Initial crystallization conditions were identified using the Index Screen (Hampton Research) and subsequently optimized to 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5), 25% PEG 3350, and 0.2 M ammonium acetate. Crystals appeared as thin plates after z1 wk and grew to a full size of around 100 3 30 3 5 in about 1­2 wk. Single crystals were removed from the cryo-protecting mother liquor using 100 or 200 mm litho loops (Hampton Research) and frozen directly in liquid ° nitrogen. Native diffraction data extending to 2.5 A resolution were collected at PXI at the Swiss Light Source (SLS). The data were indexed and processed in HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor 1997) and initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement (MR) using the P. aeruginosa Hfq (pdb:1U1S) as a search model in Phaser (McCoy et al. 2005). MR was followed by solvent flattening and 12-fold NCS averaging in Resolve (Terwilliger 2003), which

removed model bias and dramatically improved the electrondensity map. The initial model was manually inspected and corrected according to the electron density and refined, initially with a 12-fold NCS-restraint in Refmac (Murshudov et al. 1997), subsequently in Phenix (Adams et al. 2002) using standard restraints, which improved the X-ray residuals to a final Rwork/ Rfree of 18.0/23.2%.

0.6 and treated with rifampicin (300 mg/mL). At the indicated times, 30-mL samples were collected by centrifugation at 0°C. Total RNA purification and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (Møller et al. 2002a,b). The 59 end-labeled DNA probes (EM1 and EM33) used for detection of RyhB ´ RNA and sodB mRNA are described in Masse and Gottesman (2002).

Western blot analysis of sS
Overnight cultures were diluted in LB medium containing 30 mg/mL ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG to an OD600 of 0.02 and grown at 37°C. At various time points during growth, 1-mL cell-samples were removed and equal amounts of total protein from each sample were electrophoretically separated on 12% SDS­polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was probed with a 1:10.000 dilution of anti-RpoS monoclonal antibodies (NeoClone) and subsequently probed with a 1:2.000 dilution of anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Dako Cytomation). Western blots were developed using Western lightning chemiluminescence Reagent PLUS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

Gel-shift analysis and in vitro synthesis of RNA
In vitro synthesis of Spot 42 and MicA (SraD) RNAs, and 32P endlabeling were carried out as described by Møller et al. (2002a,b) and Rasmussen et al. (2005). DNA templates carrying a T7 promoter were generated by PCR for synthesis of DsrA, HbrE, and the sucC9 mRNA substrate. The primers used, were DsrA RNA: T7-dsrA (59-ATCCTGTAATACGACTCACTATTAGGACA CATCAGATTTCCTGGTGTTTCA-39) and dsrA-rev (59-AAATC CCGACCCTGAGGGGGTCG-39); HbrC RNA: T7-hbrC (59-TG TAATACGACTCACTATAGATTCGTTATCAGTGCAGG-39) and 39-hbrC (59-AAAAACCGCCAGTAAACC-39); suc9RNA: T7/sucC (59-GGGGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCGGAAG CGATACGAAATATTCGG-39) and sucC-rev (59-GGGAATTCGC GCGGAGTAGTACAGGC-39).
