Abstract Sesbania mosaic virus (SeMV) polyprotein was shown to undergo proteolytic processing when expressed in E. coli. Mutational analysis of the proposed catalytic triad residues (H181, D216, and S284) present in the N-terminal serine protease domain of the polyprotein showed that the protease was indeed responsible for this processing. Analysis of the cleavage site mutants confirmed the cleavage between proteaseviral protein genome linked (VPg) and VPg-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) at E325 ­ T326 and E402 ­ T403 sites, respectively. An additional suboptimal cleavage at E498 ­ S499 site was also identified which resulted in the further processing of RdRP to 10- and 52-kDa proteins. Thus, the protease has both E-T and E-S specificities. The polyprotein has a domain arrangement of protease-VPg-p10-RdRP, which is cleaved by the protease. The purified serine protease was also active in trans and cleaved the polyprotein at the same specific sites. These results demonstrate that the serine protease domain is responsible for the processing of SeMV polyprotein both in cis and in trans. D 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction Sesbania mosaic virus (SeMV) is a positive sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Sobemoviruses. It is a T = 3 isometric virus (Bhuvaneshwari et al., 1995) with the genome size of 4149 nucleotides. 5Vend of the genome is linked to viral protein genome linked (VPg) and 3Vterminus is nonpolyadenylated (Lokesh et al., 2001). The genome organization of SeMV comprising of four potential overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) is similar to Southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV), the type member of Sobemovirus genus (Tamm and Truve, 2000). ORF1 codes for a probable movement protein required for the systemic spread of the virus. ORF2 codes for a polyprotein having the putative protease, VPg- and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) domains. It encloses an internal ORF3 in the À1 reading frame believed to be translated by the ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. ORF4 encodes the coat protein. Polyprotein processing is a major strategy used by many viruses to generate many functional protein products from a single open reading frame (Wellink and van Kammen,

1988). The viral protease domains present within the polyprotein play a major role in this maturation process. These proteases have unique specificities and belong to serine, cysteine, serine-like cysteine, or aspartic-class of proteases (Dougherty and Semler, 1993). For example, the NIa protease of Tobacco etch virus is a serine-like cysteine protease which cleaves its polyprotein at the C-terminal side of specific glutamine residues both in cis and in trans (Carrington et al., 1988). Although the strategy of polyprotein processing and the presence of protease domains have been predicted in many viruses based on sequence analysis, only in a few cases have their functional role been confirmed by characterization of recombinant protease. The processing of the ORF2 polyprotein of Sobemoviruses is proposed to be catalyzed by the N-terminal serine protease domain (Gorbalenya et al., 1988). The putative catalytic triad H181, D216, and S284 present in Southern cowpea mosaic virus (SCPMV) is also conserved in SeMV and other members of Sobemovirus group (Lokesh et al., 2001). However, the cis or trans activities of the protease domain, its catalytic residues, and specificity of cleavage have not been described thus far. In this report, we demonstrate that the SeMV protease domain is capable of proteolytically processing the E. coli-

expressed polyprotein. Mutational analysis of the protease showed that the proposed active site amino acid residues are indeed essential for catalysis and the specificity of cleavage is at the expected E-T sites (Lokesh et al., 2001). A third, novel E-S cleavage site is identified in the RdRP domain and cleavage at this site results in the release of a 10-kDa protein, the function of which is not known. The purified protease is also active in trans and it cleaves the polyprotein at the same specific sites as in cis cleavage. Based on this study, we propose that there are three cleavage sites in the polyprotein with protease-VPg-p10RdRP domain arrangement.

Results Expression of protease and RdRP SeMV protease domain was overexpressed in E. coli cells and as expected, a 35-kDa protein corresponding to the size of protease appeared upon induction with IPTG (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Although, the protease had N-terminal hexa-histidine tag, it did not bind to the Ni-NTA column at various conditions of pH and of ionic strength. Surprisingly, the protease present in the soluble fraction could be pelleted by high-speed centrifugation (58 000 Â g for 45 min), suggesting that the lack of binding to Ni-NTA column could be due to aggregation. Analysis of the primary sequence of protease using DAS, transmembrane prediction server (ExPaSy) showed the presence of high propensity membrane helices in the N-terminus (Fig. 2). Although the N-terminal sequence was not conserved

among the members of Sobemovirus group, similar transmembrane domain was present in all the polyproteins except for Lucerne transient streak virus (LTSV, data not shown). Interestingly, the first 70 amino acid residues are absent in LTSV protease. To check whether this N-terminal transmembrane domain of protease was responsible for its aggregation status, two

deletion constructs were generated, lacking N-terminal 30 and 70 amino acid residues (DN30P and DN70P) resulting in the removal of either one or both the predicted helices, respectively. DN30P was present in the insoluble fraction (data not shown), whereas DN70P was soluble and could be purified using Ni-NTA column chromatography (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Thus, the presence of transmembrane domain resulted in aggregation and inability to bind to Ni-NTA column. The purified DN70P was used for obtaining polyclonal antibodies (designated as anti-protease antibodies). RdRP was cloned, overexpressed, and purified using Ni-NTA column under denaturing conditions as described in Materials and methods. The purified RdRP was used to raise antibodies. Cis-catalytic activity of protease and DN70P To check whether the protease is active in cis, proteaseVPg (PV) fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. In the induced cells, 44

and 35 kDa bands corresponding to PV and protease, respectively, were observed upon Western blot analysis with anti-protease antibodies (Fig. 3A, lane 3) suggesting that the protease was active in cis. However, the cleavage was not complete as more than 50% of the fusion protein (44 kDa) could still be detected. The extent of cleavage increased when the expression was carried out at lower temperature (16 jC, data not shown). Unlike in the case of PV, expression of protease-VPg lacking N-terminal 70 amino acid residues (DN70PV) resulted in nearly complete cleavage of the fusion protein and a prominent 27-Da band corresponding to the size of DN70P was observed (Fig. 3C, lane 2) with anti-protease antibodies. The reduced proteolytic activity of PV could be because of the aggregation, as removal of N-terminal 70 amino acids greatly enhanced the catalytic efficiency. To rule out that the cleavage of fusion protein was not mediated by any E. coli-derived protease, mutational analysis of the protease domain was carried out.

Mutational analysis of protease Gorbalenya et al. (1988) have proposed that the SCPMV protease is probably a serine protease with the catalytic triad H181, D216, and S284. These amino acid residues are also conserved in all Sobemoviruses. To evaluate the role of these residues in catalysis, the putative active site residues were mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis using pPV clone as template. The mutants H181A, D216A, and S284A of the fusion protein (PV) and the wild-type PV were expressed in E. coli and the cis cleavage activity was monitored using anti-protease antibodies. When compared with the wild-type PV (Fig. 3B, lane 1), H181A, D216A, and S284A mutant proteins did not undergo proteolytic maturation (Fig. 3B, lanes 2­ 4) showing that the mutation of the active site residues rendered the protease inactive. The cleavage was specific as mutation of the cleavage site E325 to alanine resulted in complete inhibition of proteolysis (Fig. 3B, lane 5). Similarly, the S284A, S284T, and E325A mutants of DN70PV were generated and the cis activity was monitored. Even here the mutations resulted in complete loss of cis activity (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 ­ 5). These results establish that the proteolytic processing is mediated by the N-terminal serine protease domain. Polyprotein processing in E. coli The cDNA corresponding to ORF2 (polyprotein, PVR) was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The processing of the polyprotein was monitored by anti-protease (N-terminus) and anti-RdRP (C-terminus) antibodies. Western blot analysis with anti-protease antibodies revealed the presence of two bands, one corresponding to the size of PV (44 kDa) and other to that of protease (35 kDa, Fig. 4A, lane 3). Similar analysis with anti-RdRP antibodies showed a band corresponding to the size of RdRP (62 kDa, Fig. 4B, lane 1). No bands were

observed with the sizes corresponding to that of VPg-RdRP (71 kDa) or the entire polyprotein (106 kDa). The presence of 44-kDa intermediate and absence of 71-kDa product suggests that the cleavage in the polyprotein occurs initially between VPg-RdRP and is complete. This is followed by second cleavage at protease-VPg, which is incomplete. The polyprotein lacking the first 70 amino acid residues (DN70PVR) was cloned and expressed in E. coli. Unlike in the case of wild-type PVR, Western analysis of DN70PVR with anti-protease antibody revealed the presence of only one band corresponding to the size of DN70P (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Neither DN70PVR nor DN70PV polyprotein precursors were detected. As observed earlier, DN70P was more active and cleaved the polyprotein at both protease-VPg and VPgRdRP sites completely. Surprisingly, immunoblot analysis with anti-RdRP antibodies revealed two protein products of size, 62 and 52 kDa (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Previously, it was presumed that the size of RdRP was 62 kDa and the corresponding cleavage site was predicted to be E402 ­ T403. The presence of lower-molecular-weight protein product could be due to further proteolytic processing of RdRP. To delineate whether the lower-molecular-weight protein was generated by N-terminal or C-terminal cleavage of RdRP, the 52-kDa band was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing and the sequence was determined to be SLIL. On comparison with the polyprotein sequence, the position of serine was mapped to 499, which was preceded by a glutamic acid residue (E498). E498 ­ S499 might represent the third cleavage site in the polyprotein. The cleavage E498 ­ S499 was incomplete as both the 62- and 52-kDa bands could be seen (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Mutational analysis of the cleavage sites The specificity of cleavage by the protease was established by mutation of E325, E402, and E498 to alanine.

Single (E325A and E498A), double (E402A-E498A), and triple (E325A-E402A-E498A) cleavage site mutations were made in the DN70PVR clone. The DN70PVR and the mutant polyproteins were expressed in E. coli and the cleavage was monitored by using anti-protease and antiRdRP antibodies as mentioned previously. A schematic representation of the cleavage site mutants and the expected size of cleavage products are shown in Fig. 5A. DN70PVR polyprotein as described earlier underwent almost complete processing to 27-kDa protease, 52 kDa RdRP, VPg, and 10-kDa proteins (Figs. 5B and C, lane 1). The later two proteins were not detected as the immounoblotting was performed only with anti-protease and antiRdRP antibodies. E325A mutation abolished the cleavage between protease and VPg, and hence a 36-kDa band corresponding to the size of DN70PV was observed with anti-protease antibodies (Fig. 5B, lane 2). As cleavage at other sites did not get affected, a 52-kDa band was observed with RdRP specific antibody (Fig. 5C, lane 2). Mutation of the cleavage site amino acid E498 to alanine resulted in generation of a 62-kDa product (p10-RdRP;

Fig. 5C, lane 3). In the double mutant E402A-E498A, cleavage at both second and third sites were inhibited, and hence a 71-kDa product corresponding to the size of VPgp10-RdRP was observed by anti-RdRP antibodies (Fig. 5C, lane 4). In both E498A and E402A-E498A mutants, cleavage occurred at E325 ­T326 position and the expected 27-kDa band was observed with anti-protease antibodies (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4). Western blot analysis with both anti-protease and anti-RdRP antibodies of the triple mutant revealed the presence of a 98-kDa band corresponding to size of the entire polyprotein (Figs. 5B and C, lane 5) conclusively establishing the cleavage sites in the SeMV polyprotein. Trans-cleavage activity of serine protease Many of the viral proteases are shown to be active both in cis and in trans. It was of interest to examine whether the SeMV protease could cleave the polyproteins in trans. Although the DN70P could be purified using Ni-NTA chromatography, it was not stable in the purified form and

tended to precipitate on standing. Since the cleavage site mutant DN70PV E325A was soluble and highly stable, it was purified and used as the enzyme instead of DN70P. Active site mutant DN70PV S284A was purified from the soluble fraction and used as the substrate. For the cleavage reaction, the purified protease (DN70PV E325A) and substrate (DN70PV S284A) were taken in 1:10 ratio in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 buffer and incubated at 37 jC for 4 h and the products were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As apparent in Fig. 6A (lane 2), two additional bands corresponding in size to DN70P (27 kDa) and VPg (9 kDa) were observed showing that the protease was active in trans. The trans-cleavage by the protease was also tested using the polyprotein substrate DN70PVR S284A. However, the expressed protein was present in the insoluble fraction. Hence, the insoluble fraction was resuspended in assay buffer and used as such in the trans-cleavage reaction. Western blot analysis with anti-RdRP antibody revealed the cleavage of substrate into a 62-kDa band (Fig. 6B, lane 3) corresponding to the cleavage between E402 and T403. The cleavage was specific as the active site mutant of protease failed to catalyze this cleavage (Fig. 6B, lane 2). To demonstrate the specificity of cleavage of the protease in trans, two mutants were generated, DN70PVR S284A-E402A and DN70PVR S284A-E325AE402A. The 71-kDa cleavage product (VPg-p10-RdRP) was obtained when DN70PVR S284A-E402A polyprotein was used as substrate (Fig. 6B, lane 4). The trans-cleavage was abolished when both E325 and E402 were mutated (Fig. 6B, lane 5) suggesting that specificity of the cleavage sites by the serine protease in trans was the same as that observed in cis. Cleavage at E498 was not observed in the

trans cleavage reaction possibly because E498 ­S499 cleavage site was suboptimal and the substrate used was insoluble.

Discussion Although the complete nucleotide sequences of several Sobemoviruses (Lee and Anderson, 1998; Lokesh et al., 2001; Makinen et al., 1995; Othman and Hull, 1995; Wu et al., 1987; Yassi et al., 1994) have been determined and the sequence analyses show a common expression strategy, there is no experimental evidence reported regarding the processing of the polyprotein. In vitro translation experiments carried out in different Sobemoviruses (Kiberstis and Zimmern, 1984; Morris-Krsinich and Forster, 1983; Salerno-Rife et al., 1980) revealed the presence of four protein products of sizes 105, 70, 33, and 18 kDa. The 105-kDa protein corresponded to the size of polyprotein. The 70kDa protein was proposed to be either the polyprotein cleavage product or the trans-frame fusion polyprotein, protease-VPg-P3 (P3 being the ORF3 product). The 33and 18-kDa proteins were identified as CP and ORF1 product, respectively. It may be noted that only limited cleavages were observed in vitro translation experiments probably due to inefficient translation or low amount of cleavage product. The proteolytic maturation of the polyprotein was proposed to be catalyzed by a putative serine protease (Gorbalenya et al., 1988). The results presented in this paper confirm the role of the SeMV serine protease in polyprotein processing. The cis-cleavage activity of the SeMV protease was demonstrated by the autocatalytic processing of (1) PV

(Figs. 3A and B), (2) DN70PV (Fig. 3C), (3) PVR (Fig. 4), and (4) DN70PVR (Fig. 4) polyproteins in E. coli. The cleavage was incomplete with PV or PVR polyproteins. However, deletion of N-terminal 70 residues from the protease domain resulted in almost complete processing of DN70PV and DN70PVR polyproteins. An analysis of the sequence of SeMV protease domain showed the presence of N-terminal putative transmembrane helices. Except in LTSV, all the known sobemoviral ORF2 products also showed the presence of these helices suggesting that they might play a role in membrane anchoring. Removal of these helices in SeMV protease resulted in increased proteolytic activity probably due to increased solubility of the expressed protein. However, the role of predicted transmembrane helices in membrane anchoring and in regulation of polyprotein processing in vivo remains to be established. Recently, in African swine fever virus, it was shown that membrane association was needed for the correct processing of polyprotein (Heath et al., 2003). In many positive sense RNA viruses, it was observed that the replication and assembly also occurs in association with membrane (Carette et al., 2002; den Boon et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2001; Rust et al., 2001). Targeting of the entire polyprotein to the site of replication or assembly could help in localization of all the protein products at the appropriate site for efficient utilization. Proteolytic processing of the full-length polyprotein of SeMV (PVR) clearly revealed the presence of PV intermediate (Fig. 4A, lane 3). It is possible that RdRP is released from the polyprotein first to enable efficient replication process to begin. Interestingly, in potyviruses and many other positive sense RNA viruses encoding VPg, ``VPg-protease'' arrangement is seen in the polyprotein. Only in Sobemoviruses and Poleroviruses is VPg domain present after the protease (Tamm and Truve, 2000). ``VPg-protease'' intermediate was observed in the processing of Grapevine fanleaf virus polyprotein and it was suggested to have a role in viral replication (Margis et al., 1994). It is possible that the PV intermediate might have a similar function in replication of Sobemoviruses. Western analysis of E. coli expressed PVR with anti-P3 antibodies did not reveal the presence of P3 indicating that ribosomal frameshifting signal of SeMV was not active. Mutational analysis of the catalytic residues H181, D216, and S284 presented in this paper establish that SeMV protease is indeed a serine protease with conserved catalytic triad and is responsible for the processing of the polyprotein. Even a conservative substitution of serine with threonine resulted in loss of activity. Analysis of the cleavage site mutants confirmed the cleavage between PV and VR at E325 ­ T326 and E402 ­ T403, respectively. Expression of DN70PVR and its autocatalytic processing (Fig. 4C, lane 2) showed that there was an additional suboptimal cleavage at E498 ­ S499, which was confirmed by mutational analysis. Further, careful analysis of the cleavage site mutants in PVR showed that when both the

cleavage sites E325 and E402 were mutated to alanine, the cleavage occurred at E498 (data not shown). Thus, there is indeed a third suboptimal cleavage in the polyprotein. The domain arrangement in SeMV polyprotein is proteaseVPg-p10-RdRP. In silico analysis of p10 amino acid sequence did not reveal any significant similarity with other proteins, and now, its function is not known. The sequences corresponding to the seven conserved motifs defining the RdRP domain is present after the third cleavage site. Hence, in Sobemoviruses, the 52-kDa protein might represent the functional RdRP. However, this needs to be confirmed by demonstration of the cleavage products in vivo in infected plant cells. An analysis of the amino acid residues present in the three cleavage sites 2 (Table 1) showed that a leucine was conserved at the PV position, whereas either asparagine or glutamine occupied P2 position. The purified DN70Protease was less stable and hence could not be used for trans-cleavage assays. On the contrary, DN70PV cleavage site mutant E325A showed a high trans-cleavage activity and was more stable (Fig. 6A). Mutational analysis confirmed that even in trans, the cleavage mediated by SeMV serine protease was specific to E325 ­ T326 and E402 ­ T403 sites. Thus, SeMV serine protease can function both in cis and in trans. The results presented in this paper establish that the Nterminal serine protease domain is responsible for polyprotein processing in Sobemoviruses and it could be involved in the regulation of viral replication.

Materials and methods Construction of recombinant plasmids E. coli strain DH5a (BRL) was used for cloning and propagation. The desired region of the genome was amplified using specific primers (Table 2) from the fulllength cDNA template. Sense primers were designed with NheI and NdeI sites, whereas the antisense primer was designed with a BamHI site preceded by the stop codon. The PCR was carried out using Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The PCR product was eluted from the gel (Novagen), digested with NheI and BamHI enzymes (MBI Fermentas) and cloned at the same sites in pRSET A vector. The expressed proteins from such recombinant clones have 13 additional amino acids including six

histidine residues at the N-terminus. All the clones were initially screened by restriction analysis and later confirmed by DNA sequencing. A schematic representation of the different proteins expressed from the recombinant clones is shown in Fig. 7. Expression, purification, and raising polyclonal antibodies to recombinant proteins E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells were transformed with the recombinant clones (Fig. 7) and the proteins were expressed by induction with 0.3 mM IPTG for 4­ 5 h at 30 jC. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% TritonX-100, 5% glycerol), sonicated, and the expression was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Laemmli, 1970). DN70P (protease with N-terminal 70 amino acid deletion) was purified from the soluble fraction using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen). RdRP was purified from inclusion bodies under denatured condition (buffer A + 6 M guanidine HCl) using Ni-NTA column as per manufacturer's instructions. The purity of protein samples was checked by SDS-PAGE. One hundred to two hundred micrograms of each of these purified proteins were emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into rabbits subcutaneously for raising polyclonal antibodies. Further injections were given with Freund's incomplete adjuvant and after two boosters the antisera were collected and checked for the presence of

antibodies by Western blot analysis using the respective proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis Site directed mutagenesis was performed by PCRbased approach (Weiner et al., 1994). The sense and antisense primers were designed with desired changes in the nucleotides (Table 2) and restriction sites were incorporated in the primers to enable easy screening. The PCR was performed using Deep Vent polymerase with appropriate DNA templates. Methylated wild-type plasmid template was digested using methyl-specific endonuclease DpnI (New England Biolabs) and transformed into E. coli DH5a cells. Plasmids were isolated from the transformed colonies and checked for mutation by restriction analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Polyprotein processing in E. coli The cis-cleavage of the E. coli expressed polyprotein was assayed by Western blotting as follows. The cells were harvested, sonicated in buffer A, and the crude extract was separated by SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) and probed with polyclonal antibodies specific to protease and RdRP. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bangalore Genei) was used as

Genome organization of SeMV and the arrangement of different ORFs are shown. The predicted domains and the corresponding nucleotide positions of ORF2 are as indicated. The different protein products expressed from the recombinant clones along with the expected molecular weights are shown.

secondary antibody and the blot was developed using hydrogen peroxide and diamino benzidine (Sambrook et al., 1989). N-terminal amino acid sequencing The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the polyprotein cleavage product was determined by initially separating the proteins on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel, followed by transferring them on to PVDF membrane (Sigma). The membrane was stained with 0.05% w/v Ponseau S in 0.1% acetic acid (Matsudaira, 1987), the appropriate band was cut and used for sequencing in a Shimadzu gas-phase sequenator PSQ-1. Trans-cleavage assay of protease The trans-cleavage assay was performed with purified DN70PV-E325A protease (cleavage site mutant). The clones representing DN70PVR and DN70PV were used as templates to generate active site mutant (S284A) such that the overexpressed proteins from the clones would be incapable of autocatalytic cleavage and could be used as substrates. The DN70PVR S284A polyprotein expressed in E. coli was present in the insoluble fraction. Hence, for the assay, the pellet obtained after centrifuging the cell extract was suspended in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 buffer and used directly. On the other hand, DN70PV S284A was soluble and was purified using Ni-NTA chromatography as mentioned previously. The substrates were incubated with DN70PV-E325A protease for 4 h at 37 jC, the reaction was stopped by boiling with loading dye, separated on

12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted. Acknowledgments This work was supported by Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, India.
