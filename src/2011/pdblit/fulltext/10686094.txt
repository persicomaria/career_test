A manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) from the liver of bullfrog, Ranu catesbeianu, was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 84,000 and is composed of four identical subunits, each containing one manganese atom. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is similar to that of MnSODS isolated from human and chicken livers, but differs considerably from that of the Escherichia coli enzyme (D. Barra et al. (1984) J BioL Chem. 259, 12595-12601; R. A. Weisiger and I. Fridovich (1973) J BioL Chem. 248, 3582-3592; H. M. Steinman (1978) J. BioL Chem. 253,8'708-8720). The N-terminal amino acid is lysine. The sequence of 23 amino acid residues in the N-terminal region was determined. It shows excellent homologies with those of the human and chicken enzymes (H. M. Steinmam and R. L. Hill (1973) Proc. NutL Acad. 5%. USA 70, 3725-3729; C. Ditlow et al. (1982) Carl&erg Res. Commun. 47, 81-91). The frog liver enzyme is located exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix.

OKAZAKI Rocket immunoelectrophoresis was performed on an agarose gel casted on a GelBond. The plate (12 X 9 cm) consisted of 1.2% agarose C, 4.0 mg antibody against Mn-SOD, and 10 mM barbital buffer, pH 8.6. Electrophoresis was carried out in 100 mM barbital buffer, pH 8.6, for 4 h at a constant current of 20 mA at 4'C. The gel was stained for SOD activity according to the procedure of Beauchamps and Fridovich used in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16). The bullfrog liver mitochondria were prepared according to the procedure of Bustamante et al (17). Localization of Mn-SOD in submitochondrial fractions was determined according to the method of Schnaitman and Greenawalt (18). The mitochondria were incubated for 10 min with increasing concentrations of and digitonin and then separated into supernatants pellets by centrifugation at 10,000~ for 10 min. Activities of acid phosphatase, sulfite oxidase, and glutamate dehydrogenase were determined by the methods of Schachter et al (19), Cohen and Fridovich (20), and Schmidt (21). Protein was determined by Lowry's method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (22). Spectrophotometric measurements were performed with a Hitachi 340 recording spectrophotometer using a lomm cell. RESULTS

further Mn-SOD in the liver of the bullfrog in connection with the development of the animal. In the present paper we describe the purification and characterization of Mn-SOD from the liver of the bullfrog and the results of immunological quantification and subcellular distribution of the enzyme in the adult frog and tadpole liver cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

The bullfrog R catesbeianu and its tadpole were obtained from Matsumoto Experimental Animals Co., Tokyo. The Mn-SOD of Serratia marcescem was commercially obtained from Wako Junyaku. Agarose C was purchased from Pharmacia. Superoxide dismutase was assayed by the xanthine oxidase-nitroblue tetrazolium system as previously described (13). Mn-SOD was distinguished from Cu,Zn-SOD by assaying the sample in the presence of 1 mM potassium cyanide. One unit of SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme that inhibits the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium by 50% of the maximal inhibition which is attained in the presence of an excess amount of the enzyme, under the conditions specified. Molecular weight was estimated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column (107 X 26 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed on 18% gels according to the method of Laemmli and Favre (14). The markers used were human hemoglobin, beef liver catalase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, and horse heart cytochrome c for gel filtration, and bovine serum albumin, rabbit muscle creatin kinase, chymotrypsinogen A, and lysozyme for electrophoresis. Manganese was analyzed by a Shimazu AA-650 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Amino acid composition was determined by the standard procedure with a Hitachi Model KLA 5 amino acid analyzer. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined with the aid of an Applied Biosystems 470A gas-phase sequencer and Model 120A PTH analyzer system, operated under standard conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. Antibody was raised in the rabbit to Mn-SOD purified from frog liver. Approximately 0.1 mg of the antigen emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into the back of a rabbit once a week for 3 weeks. Six days after the last injection, blood was drawn and IgG was obtained from the serum by precipitation with 50% saturated on a column (NH&SOI, followed by chromatography of DEAE A&Gel Blue. Single radial immunodiffusion was performed as described by Mancini et al (15).

Frozen liver (3500 g) of the adult bullfrog was homogenized by a Polytron homogenizer in 12.5 liters of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 50 PM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and centrifuged at 20,OOOg 40 min. The supernafor tant was heated at 60°C for 5 min in a water bath, followed by chilling in an ice bath. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation at 10,000~ for 20 min, and the supernatant was subjected to fractionation by ammonium sulfate. The proteins precipitated between 40 and 70% saturation of ammonium sulfate were dissolved in and then exhaustively dialyzed against 15 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.8. To the dialyzed solution (2 liters) was added 2000 g of DE52 cellulose, which had been equilibrated with the same buffer, and the solution was stirred for 24 h. The proteins absorbed to the cellulose were collected on a Buchner funnel, washed with 3 vol of 15 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 7.8, and then eluted with 3 liters of the same buffer containing 80 I'nM NaCI. The eluate was dialyzed against 2 mM

Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, and passed through a column of DEAE Affi-Gel Blue (29 X 26 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The unabsorbed fraction was pooled and precipitated again by 80% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The precipitates were dissolved in a minimal amount of 50 InM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and applied to a Sephadex G-75 column (100 X 4.8 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The active fractions eluted were pooled and dialyzed against 2 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The dialyzed solution again was passed through a DEAE Affi-Gel Blue column (21 X 2 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The unabsorbed enzyme fraction was collected and dialyzed against 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, for 5 h. The enzyme solution then was applied to a Bio-Gel HTP column (9.5 X 1.2 cm) equilibrated with 5 InM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, and eluted with a linear gradient formed with 200 ml each of the starting buffer and 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Table I summarizes the results of the purification procedure. The Mn-SOD activity in homogenates was not detectable under the assay condition before the step of heat treatment. It was also found that Mn-SOD was separated from

the cyanide-sensitive SOD (Cu,Zn-SOD) at the first step of DEAE Affi-Gel Blue. The enzyme was finally purified about 1200 times with a yield of 20%. The enzyme preparation was electrophoretically homogeneous in the absence and the presence of SDS, as shown in Figs. 1A and B. As seen in Fig. 1A the position of the band stained for the enzyme activity corresponds to that of the band stained for protein.

frog liver mitochondria prepared by the method of Bustamante et al were treated with digitonin. Figure 5 shows release of Mn-SOD and of various marker enzymes into the supernatant as a function of digitonin concentration. The result indicates that Mn-SOD is released at the same digitonin concentration and to the same relative extent as glutamate dehydrogenase activity, thus indicating that Mn-SOD in the frog liver resides in the mitochondrial matrix.
DISCUSSION

mined by means of rocket immunoelectrophoresis. The results are shown in Table III, together with the contents of Cu,ZnSOD that were reported previously. It should be noticed that the adult frog liver contains about twice the amount of MnSOD as compared with the tadpole liver. This contrasts with the amount of Cu,ZnSOD which is almost the same in the livers of both animals. Table IV shows the distribution of MnSOD in the subcellular fractions of the adult frog liver. As seen, the bulk of MnSOD was found in the 10,000~pellet, closely associated with glutamate dehydrogenase activity, indicating that Mn-SOD in the frog liver is located in the mitochondria (about 30% of the total Mn-SOD found in the 100,000~supernatant may be attributed to a contamination of the mitochondrial enzyme, because of its close correlation with glutamate dehydrogenase activity). To analyze further the precise localization of Mn-SOD in mitochondria, crude

In the present study, Mn-SOD first was isolated from the liver of the bullfrog. The enzyme was found to be similar to the enzymes from chicken (3), rat (6), bovine (7), and human (5,8) with respect to molecular weight, subunit structure, and amino acid composition. The enzyme is composed of four identical subunits, and has a tetramerit molecular weight of 34,000. The frog enzyme has four manganese atoms per molecule and an absorption coefficient at 475 nm of 2500 M-~ cm-`, which correlates well with the properties of the rat or human enzyme. Weisiger et aL (3) and Marklund (7) have reported that the chicken liver enzyme purified under acidic pH and the bovine heart enzyme purified using an isoelectrophoretic procedure have about

two manganese atoms per molecule. It is probable, however, that some manganese atoms in these enzymes are lost during preparation procedures. We found that about one-half of the total metal content in the frog enzyme was lost when the enzyme was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thus it can be said from these analyses that the enzyme occurring in the frog liver does not have exceptional molecular properties when compared with the family members of Mn-SOD so far found in animals. The complete amino acid sequences of Mn-SOD are known for the enzymes from human liver, Saccharomgces cerevtiiae, E. coli, and Bacillus stearothwmophilus. The N-terminal amino acid sequences also have been reported for Mn-SOD from chicken liver and for Mn- and Fe-SOD from several microorganisms (4, 28). The N-terminal sequences of the frog liver Mn-SOD reported in the present paper are the third case of a partial sequence determined with a vertebrate Mn-SOD. Although the comparisons are restricted to only about onetenth the entire length of the peptide chain, it is apparent from the present result that the sequence is highly conserved within the animal species. Besides that Mn-SODS in most animal tissues are thought to be confined to the mitochondrial matrix, substantial quantities of Mn-SOD have been found also in the cytosol fractions of chicken, baboon, and human livers (5). The total amount of Mn-SOD and the ratio of Mn-SOD to Cu,Zn-SOD in cells also vary from tissue to tissue and from species to species. In the present study, it became evident that MnSOD in the frog liver cell is restricted in the mitochondrial matrix in the amount of 20-30 lug/g liver (Table IV). This value is roughly comparable to those reported for the rat and bovine liver Mn-SODS (6). However, Asayama and Burr have reported that the rat liver contains 118 pg of MnSOD/g using a radioimmunoassay technique (29). On the other hand, the human liver contains 614 pg of Mn-SOD/g, and in this case the enzyme is not exclusively located in the mitochondria, but is found predominantly in the cytoplasm (5). These

differences in subcellular distribution of Mn-SOD are of great interest when contrasted with the high degree of homology in the primary structure of the enzyme among animal species. Another point of note in the present study is that the adult frog liver contains twice the amount of Mn-SOD (in terms of pg/mg protein) as the tadpole liver, while the contents of Cu,Zn-SOD, as previously reported, hardly differ between the livers of both animals. A rapid oxygen-induced synthesis of the mitochondrial SOD has been demonstrated in pulmonary macrophages of neonatal rats (30, 31), and administration of 2,4-dinitrophenol, which enhances 0; generation in mitochondria, resulted in a fivefold increase in the rat liver Mn-SOD, but no change in Cu,Zn-SOD (32). It is also known that the synthesis of Mn-SOD in yeast is dependent upon oxygen and is considered to be controlled by some metabolic product of oxygen (33). All of these phenomena imply that Mn-SOD is more labile than Cu,Zn-SOD in reflecting physiological changes in oxygen metabolism of the cell. It appears that the differences in content of Mn-SOD observed in the liver mitochondria of the tadpole and adult frog can be attributed to the biochemical alternations of the mitochondrial function which occur during metamorphosis. The mechanism involved should be elucidated further.
