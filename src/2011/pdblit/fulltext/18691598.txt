SUMMARY

The crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase III a subunit reveals that the structure of the catalytic domain of the eubacterial replicative polymerase is unrelated to that of the eukaryotic replicative polymerase but rather belongs to the Polb-like nucleotidyltransferase superfamily. A model of the polymerase complexed with both DNA and b-sliding clamp interacting with a reoriented binding domain and internal b binding site was constructed that is consistent with existing biochemical data. Within the crystal, two C-terminal domains are interacting through a surface that is larger than many dimer interfaces. Since replicative polymerases of eubacteria and eukaryotes/archaea are not homologous, the nature of the replicative polymerase in the last common ancestor is unknown. Although other possibilities have been proposed, the plausibility of a ribozyme DNA polymerase should be considered.

INTRODUCTION Replicative DNA polymerases function at the heart of the replication fork to faithfully duplicate chromosomal DNA. In both bacteria and eukaryotes, the replicative polymerase forms the core of a large complex macromolecular assembly termed the replicase. The eubacterial replicase, or DNA polymerase III (PolIII) holoenzyme, is composed of fifteen subunits that can be divided into three functional elements: the core polymerase, the clamp loader complex, and the b-sliding clamp (Kornberg and Baker, 1992). In Escherichia coli, the PolIII core is a heterotrimer composed of a, 3, and q subunits. The a subunit is the replicative DNA polymerase (PolIIIa). The 3 subunit of the complex is a 30 -50 proofreading exonuclease which ensures

the fidelity of replication. The final subunit, q, has no known function except a minor stimulation of the 3 subunit (Johnson and O'Donnell, 2005). Association of PolIIIa with the clamp (b subunit), a ring-shaped molecule believed to topologically encircle the duplex DNA product (Kong et al., 1992), makes the complex extremely processive. Due to the antiparallel structure of the double helix and because polymerases can only synthesize DNA with a 50 to 30 polarity, the replicase utilizes two PolIII core complexes to synthesize one strand of DNA continuously and the other discontinuously. The continuous strand is synthesized in the same direction as replication fork movement and is termed the leading strand, whereas the discontinuous strand is synthesized in the opposite direction, in 1­3 kb Okazaki fragments, and is termed the lagging strand. The clamp loader complex, a multisubunit ATPase (subunit composition of gt2dd0 cc) functions to load the clamp onto RNA primed initiation sites (Johnson and O'Donnell, 2005). Upon completion of an Okazaki fragment, PolIIIa must be released from the DNA so that synthesis of the next fragment can begin. This cycling of PolIIIa, also known as the lagging strand processivity switch, is facilitated by the t subunit of the clamp loader complex (Leu et al., 2003). The interactions between PolIIIa, clamp, and the t subunit have been studied best in E. coli. Two distinct clamp binding sites on PolIIIa have been identified: one internal and one C-terminal. The internal b binding site is absolutely required for binding clamp both in vitro and in vivo (Dohrmann and McHenry, 2005). The role of the C-terminal binding site is less clear. Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal twenty amino acids of PolIIIa bind to both the clamp and the t subunit in a competitive reaction (Lopez de Saro et al., 2003). However, a C-terminal deletion mutant of PolIIIa has only a 4-fold reduction in clamp binding but a 400-fold reduction in t subunit binding. This implies that the majority of the energy for binding clamp comes from the internal b binding site. Therefore, upon encountering a nick, the t subunit must disrupt the internal b binding site in order to displace the polymerase from

clamp (Leu et al., 2003); the mechanism through which this disruption occurs is unknown. Six families of DNA-dependent DNA polymerases (A, B, C, D, X, and Y) have been identified on the basis of amino ´ acid sequence comparisons (Filee et al., 2002). Polymerases from the first three families play critical roles in replication. PolIIIa is a member of family C, which is found exclusively in eubacteria, whereas all archaeal and eukaryotic replicative polymerases belong to family B. Family A includes DNA polymerase I, a eubacterial polymerase that converts the Okazaki RNA primer into DNA. Family D polymerases are currently restricted to archaea, and their biological role is unknown. The last two families, families X and Y, contain specialized polymerases that are involved ´ in DNA repair (Filee et al., 2002). Crystal structures have been determined for members of all the major families of DNA polymerase except family C. Although no structure is known for a true eukaryotic replicative polymerase, those of distant viral homologs of these enzymes have been determined (Wang et al., 1997). These structures have revealed that all DNA polymerases share a common overall architecture likened to that of a right hand, consisting of three domains: the fingers, palm, and thumb. The fingers domain interacts with the incoming nucleotide and the ssDNA template, while the thumb domain binds the duplex DNA product. The palm domain contains the catalytic residues that bind the magnesium ions needed for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. The structures of the fingers and thumb domains are unique in each family, whereas the palm domain can be assigned to one of two folds. Families A, B, and Y all share the classic palm domain first seen in the structure of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Ollis et al., 1985). This fold is also observed in the palm domain of reverse transcriptase (Kohlstaedt et al., 1992) and T7 RNA polymerase (Sousa et al., 1993). In contrast, the palm domains of the family X polymerases (Sawaya et al., 1994; Davies et al., 1994) belong to the Polb-like nucleotidyltransferase (bNT) superfamily (Aravind and Koonin, 1999). It is generally accepted that there is no relationship between the classic and the bNT palm folds, and they may represent a case of convergent evolution to a common catalytic mechanism (Steitz et al., 1994). Regardless of the fold of their palm domains, all known polynucleotide polymerases utilize the same two-metal-ion mechanism for nucleotide addition (Steitz, 1998). Further, superposition of the DNA substrates bound to the classic and bNT palm folds shows a similar orientation of the catalytic metal ions and nonhomologous ``thumb'' and ``fingers'' domains carrying out similar functions (Steitz et al., 1994), which lead to the renaming of these domains from that given (Pelletier et al., 1994). Despite decades of research on DNA polymerases, relatively little detail is known of the polymerase actually responsible for replicating the genome of eubacteria, PolIIIa. The expected polymerase domains of PolIIIa (Kim et al., 1997) share no recognizable sequence similarity with any polymerase of known structure. It has therefore been

unclear whether family C polymerases have the same architecture as the other DNA polymerase families and whether their catalytic domain is related to that of the family B eukaryotic replicative polymerases. Furthermore, unlike the majority of polymerases whose structures are known, PolIIIa functions as part of a larger macromolecule machine. Within this machine, PolIIIa is known to interact directly with four other subunits: 3, q, b, and t (Kornberg and Baker, 1992). The molecular detail of how these subunits function with PolIIIa in replicating the genome is poorly understood. The crystal structure of full-length PolIIIa described here provides a framework for interpreting the existing biochemical information, as well as a foundation for future biochemical and structural studies aimed at understanding bacterial replication. RESULTS Structure Determination and Overall Architecture The crystal structure of full-length Thermus aquaticus ° PolIIIa was determined to 3.0 A resolution and represents the first crystal structure of a cellular replicative polymerase. The amino acid sequence of the Taq enzyme is 39% identical to that of its E. coli homolog (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Indeed, replication of the closely related organism Thermus thermophilus has been reconstituted in vitro and shown to not differ significantly from that of E. coli (Bullard et al., 2002). The high degree of similarity allows us to confidently identify the corresponding residues in E. coli PolIIIa (throughout the manuscript, residue numbering in E. coli will have the prefix Eco). Orthorhombic crystals in space group C2221 were grown by vapor diffusion and contained one polymerase molecule per asymmetric unit. Initial phases were obtained by the single isomorphous replacement method using crystals soaked in mercury. These phases were improved by cross crystal averaging using a second crystal ° form (space group P212121), which diffracted to 3.4 A. After temperature factor sharpening of the amplitudes the resulting maps gave readily interpretable side-chain density across the majority of the molecule. A typical portion of electron density is shown in Figure 1. The structures of the enzyme complexed with dATP that had been soaked into the crystals were determined in the C2221 crystal form by difference Fourier techniques. Both crystal forms were obtained in the presence of primer/template DNA; however, no density for this substrate was observed. Recently, it has become apparent that this maybe due to the presence of an active nuclease domain (see below) that presumably digested the DNA. The final model, refined against the C2221 crystal form, has good geometry and an R factor and free R factor of 22.7% and 27.5%, respectively (Table 1). The 140 kDa polymerase is organized into six domains that form an irregular pyramid around a central cavity (Figure 2). Four domains in the N-terminal two-thirds of the molecule form the characteristic hand-shaped cleft

894 Cell 126, 893­904, September 8, 2006 ª2006 Elsevier Inc.

up the base and one wall of the cleft. The remainder of the cleft is formed by an N-terminal polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) domain (residues 1­285; Eco1­272) and a small four helix bundle which is most likely the thumb (residues 493­574; Eco431­510). The localization of the polymerase domains to the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein is consistent with previous deletion mutagenesis studies (Kim et al., 1997). The domain that contains the internal binding site for the b-clamp, which we have termed the b binding domain (residues 836­1012; Eco779­973), extends from the active site via the fingers and completes the base of the pyramid. The C-terminal domain, or CTD, (residues 1013­1220; Eco974­1160) lies loosely seated on top of the b binding domain and caps the pyramid. The Palm Domain Belongs to the Polb-like Nucleotidyltransferase Superfamily The core of the palm domain, which contains the metal ion binding carboxylates that are indispensable for catalysis, consists of a five stranded mixed b sheet connected by two a helices. The topology and connectivity of this core is identical to that of the bNT fold (Figure 3A), placing the replicative polymerases of eubacteria (family C DNA polymerases) into the bNT superfamily. In contrast, the replicative polymerases of eukaryotes belong to the classic palm superfamily (Figure 3A), as do the majority of DNA polymerases. In fact, the only other DNA polymerase family

previously found in other polymerases. The structure of the polymerase complexed with dATP locates the polymerase active site region and, therefore, by analogy to other polymerases, the fingers (residues 623­835; Eco560­778) and the palm (residues 286­492 and 575­ 622; Eco272­430 and Eco511­559), which together make

to utilize the bNT fold is family X, whose founding member, Polb, acts in base-excision repair (Davies et al., 1994; Sawaya et al., 1994). Other bNT polymerases have more specialized functions. Poly(A) polymerase is a templateindependent RNA polymerase that polyadenylates premRNA in eukaryotes, and the CCA adding enzyme ensures maturation and repair of the 30 end of tRNA by means of the template independent addition of the sequence CCA (Aravind and Koonin, 1999). The structure of the palm domain of rat Polb (Davies et al., 1994; Sawaya et al., 1994) is most closely related in the structural database to the palm domain of PolIIIa. The two palm domains superimpose with a root-mean° square deviation (rmsd) of 2.6 A over 77 Ca atoms (Figure 3B). The degree of similarity between the bNT palm domains of polymerase families C and X is remarkably similar to that observed between the classic palm domains of polymerase families A and B. Superposition of the palm domain of the family A Klenow fragment (Ollis et al., 1985) on the palm domain of the family B RB69 poly° merase (Wang et al., 1997) gives an rmsd of 2.6 A over 82 Ca atoms. All bNT family members contain three conserved acidic residues that bind the catalytic magnesium ions (Pelletier et al., 1994). Superposition of the PolIIIa and rat Polb palm domains aligns the three catalytic aspartates of Polb (D190, D192, and D256) with the three absolutely conserved aspartate residues of PolIIIa (D463, D465, and D618; EcoD401, EcoD403, and EcoD555), identified by Pritchard and McHenry (1999) as the catalytic residues of PolIIIa by mutagenesis (Figure 3B). Thus, it is expected

that PolIIIa will utilize the same two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism as Polb and all other known polymerases (Steitz, 1998). In fact, examination of the PolIIIa active site reveals a single magnesium ion located between the catalytic residues D463 (EcoD401) and D465 (EcoD403). This ion was assigned as magnesium after inspection of anomalous difference Fourier maps derived from crystals soaked in manganese. Three other conserved residues in Polb (G179, S180, and R254) are also conserved in PolIIIa (G425, S426, and K616; EcoG363, EcoS364, and EcoK553). The glycine and serine lie in a loop which forms part of the incoming nucleotide binding pocket and are conserved across the bNT superfamily (although in some sequences the serine is replaced by a second glycine). The arginine/lysine forms a salt bridge with the phosphate moiety of the terminal 30 base of the primer in the ternary complex of Polb (Sawaya et al., 1994) and is absolutely conserved as a positive residue in both family C and family X polymerases. The Fingers Domain The fingers of PolIIIa are a large crescent-shaped structure composed exclusively of a helices (Figure 2). The face of the fingers domain that is adjacent to the palm domain is formed by a network of highly conserved residues, dominated by solvent-exposed aromatic and arginine residues. Indeed, mapping of an alignment of 150 PolIIIa sequences onto the surface of PolIIIa shows that most of the conserved residues cluster at the interface between palm and fingers domains (Figure S2). The conservation in this

region and the chemical nature of the inside face of the fingers domain is consistent with DNA polymerases from all families. Inspection of difference electron density maps generated using observed amplitudes from native and crystals that had been soaked in 5 mM dATP shows strong electron density features on the inside face of the fingers domain consistent with the triphosphate moiety of a bound dATP molecule (Figure S3). The triphosphate interacts with a cluster of four highly conserved arginine residues (R452 and R458 from the palm and R766 and R767 from the fingers domain; EcoR390, EcoR396, EcoR709, and ° EcoR710 respectively), and lies approximately 10 A away from the catalytic aspartates on the palm domain. The position of the dATP in the binary complex is not consistent with the ternary position necessary for catalytic insertion, but rather may correspond to a preinsertion site analogous to that observed in T7 RNA polymerase (Temiakov et al., 2004) and Klenow fragment (Beese et al., 1993). The PHP Domain The PHP domain is found in all PolIIIa sequences and was originally identified by Aravind and Koonin (1998) for its similarity to histidinol phosphatase. Recently, T. the PolIIIa was found to exhibit a zinc ion-dependent 30 -50 exonuclease activity, which was attributed to its PHP domain (Stano et al., 2006). This surprising result implies that PolIIIa may posses two proofreading activities, one residing in cis with the PHP domain and the other in trans with the 3 subunit. PHP domains are also found associated with some family X polymerases, providing a further link between these two polymerase families (Aravind and Koonin, 1998); no classic palm polymerase is known to

contain a PHP domain. The structures of only two other members of the PHP family are known, those of E. coli YcdX (Teplyakov et al., 2003) and the Thermotoga maritime protein TM0559 (PDB ID, 2ANU), both of which are isolated PHP proteins of unknown function. All three structures are formed from an a7b7 barrel (Figure 4A). However, the b strands of YcdX are all parallel, whereas in TM0559 and the PHP domain the direction of the fourth b strand is reversed creating an unusual mixed b barrel structure. The presumed PHP active site sits in a cleft at the C-terminal side of the b barrel and contains two metal ions held in place by protein imidazole and carboxylate groups (Figure 4A). With the exception of the PolIIIa sequences from Proteobacteria (including E. coli) and some grampositive bacteria, the residues involved in metal binding are conserved across the entire PHP family (Aravind and Koonin, 1998). The proteins that lack conservation appear to have residue substitutions which would compromise one or more of their metal binding sites. In agreement with biochemical analysis (Stano et al., 2006), X-ray data collected at wavelengths near the zinc absorption edge establish that the two metal ions at the PHP active site are zinc. The two zinc ions are separated by a distance ° ° of 4.6 A rather than a distance of 4.0 A that would be expected for efficient catalysis by the two-metal-ion mechanism (Steitz, 1998). Comparison with YcdX and TM0559 reveals a potential third zinc binding site in PolIIIa formed by residues E72 (EcoD69), H95 (EcoH83), and C145 (EcoG134). In the current structure this site is occupied by a water molecule (Figure 4A). However, a zinc ion at ° this site would be 4.0 A away from the nearest zinc ion observed in the current structure and hence more consistent with catalysis.

The Thumb Domain We have tentatively assigned the four helix bundle located above the PHP domain as the thumb (Figure 2). Although the structure of the thumb of PolIIIa is unrelated to any structure in the structural database, many polymerases, including Polb, reverse transcriptase and the bypass polymerase, Dbh, utilize a helical-bundle fold as a thumb domain (Davies et al., 1994; Sawaya et al., 1994; Kohlstaedt et al., 1992; Zhou et al., 2001). In the structures of polymerase binary and ternary complexes, the thumb domain binds to the primer/template DNA. It is conceivable that both the four helix bundle and PHP domain fulfill this role in PolIIIa. It is also possible that a portion of the PHP domain plays a role characteristic of that played by the thumb domains of other polymerases. In E. coli, the deletion of the first sixty N-terminal residues abolishes polymerase activity (Kim et al., 1997) and mutation of the PHP domain residue EcoD43 (D46 in Taq) has been shown to reduce polymerase activity (Wieczorek and McHenry, 2006). Additionally, alignment of Polb onto PolIIIa by superposition of their palm domains shows that the thumb domain of Polb overlaps not with the thumb domain of PolIIIa but with its PHP domain. Likewise, whereas the sequence of the Polb thumb is lo-

cated N-terminal to that of the palm, it is the PHP domain of PolIIIa which is N-terminal to the palm while the thumb is an insertion within the palm domain (Figure 3A). The b Binding Domain We have named the domain containing the internal b binding site for the clamp the b binding domain, since mutagenesis has shown this site is essential for clamp binding (Dohrmann and McHenry, 2005). The b binding domain has an ab fold (Figure 4B) and interacts extensively with the fingers domain, resulting in the two domains forming a markedly elongated structure (Figure S2). The internal b binding site, residues 975­979 (Eco920­924), is located at the N terminus of a highly mobile and extended loop, located at the opposite side of the domain from its interface with fingers (Figure 4B). Although there are no structures in the structural database that are homologous to the b binding domain, it does contain a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) DNA binding motif (residues 892­910; Eco836­ 854). This motif is found in many proteins that bind DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner (Doherty et al., 1996) including the thumb domain of Polb, which superimposes ° with an rmsd of 0.97 A over 19 Ca atoms.

The C-Terminal Domain The CTD has a bipartite structure composed of two subdomains (Figure 4C). The first subdomain (residues 1013­1126; Eco964­1078) consists of an oligonucleotide binding (OB) fold (Theobald et al., 2003). Numerous crystal structures have shown the OB fold binds nucleic acids by burying their bases in a surface groove, while the phosphodiester backbone remains mostly solvent exposed (Figure 4C). The surface groove is formed by loops that extend from the core b sheet and is too narrow to accommodate nucleic acid duplex (Theobald et al., 2003). It is therefore reasonable to assume that the PolIIIa OB fold functions by interacting with the ssDNA template (discussed below). The second subdomain (residues 1127­ 1220; Eco1083­1160) is composed of a four-stranded b sheet flanked on one face by two a helices and on the other by the OB fold (Figure 4C). Electron density describing this subdomain is of poor quality, and the corresponding region of the current model may contain main-chain tracing errors. Nevertheless, it appears that the C-terminal b binding site, mapped to the C-terminal twenty residues in E. coli (Lopez de Saro et al., 2003), is completely disordered, presumably as a result of its flexibility. The two subdomains are connected by a potentially flexible hinge. Indeed, the interface between the two subdomains is of a polar nature and not well packed. This and the weakness of the electron density describing the entire domain suggest that the two subdomains may be mobile with respect to one another and the other polymerase domains. In both of the two related crystal forms of PolIIIa, the CTD forms a striking dimer interface (Figure 4C). The interface is of mixed character, with good surface complemen° tarity and buries 900 A2 of surface per monomer, which is within the range expected for a stable dimer (Chothia and Janin, 1975). The replisome contains two copies of PolIIIa, one replicating the leading and the other the lagging strand. Although PolIIIa is a monomer in solution, perhaps the dimer interface observed in the crystal lattice is formed at the replication fork, facilitated by the increase in the local concentration of polymerase. Homology Modeling of DNA onto the Polymerase Active Site The structural similarity between the palm domains of PolIIIa and Polb allows us to use the structures of the ternary complex of rat Polb (Pelletier et al., 1994) to homology model the primer/template DNA and incoming nucleotide onto the structure of apo PolIIIa. This type of homology modeling has been successfully used to construct a model of DNA complexed with a Y family bypass polymerase that contains the classic palm fold (Zhou et al., 2001; Ling et al., 2001). The numerous ternary complexes of the classic palm polymerases (Steitz and Yin, 2004) have revealed little variation in the positioning of the incoming nucleotide and primer terminus with respect to the catalytic magnesium ions. We would also expect the orientation of these catalytic elements to be conserved within polymerases containing a bNT palm. Indeed, despite the differences

in the orientations of the tRNA and DNA substrates, comparison of the ternary complexes of the bNT superfamily Polb and the class I CCA adding enzyme reveals a remarkable similarity in the positions of their primer terminus and incoming nucleotide relative to the catalytic elements (Xiong and Steitz, 2004). Analysis of the homology model of the ternary complex shows that the interactions made by the incoming nucleotide, templating base, and adjacent two base pairs of duplex DNA product are in excellent agreement with those seen in the Polb structure and exhibit no clashes with the protein main chain (Figure 5A). The catalytic aspartate residues (D463, D465, and D618; EcoD401, EcoD403, and EcoD555) are ideally positioned for magnesium ion binding and the backbone phosphate of the modeled 30 primer terminal nucleotide base forms a salt bridge with K616 (EcoK553). In addition, upon the presumed closing of the fingers onto the primer terminus, two absolutely conserved arginine residues, R452 and R458 (EcoR390 and EcoR396), are well positioned on the fingers to bind the triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide. The binding site for the incoming nucleotide in the homology model shows that, like most other polymerase families, including Polb, the fingers are in an open conformation in the absence of bound substrates. Comparison of the fingers of PolIIIa with those of the ternary complex of Polb reveals that although the fold of these domains is nonhomologous, both contain an a helix, albeit oriented in the opposite direction, located at the primer terminus of the product DNA duplex (Figure 5A). In Polb, helix M residues Y271 and F272 form part of the incoming nucleotide binding pocket, and it has been proposed that backbone atoms of the N terminus of helix M play a role in specifically selecting deoxyribonucleotide over ribonucleotide for incorporation (Pelletier et al., 1994). Residues H817 (EcoH760) and Y821 (EcoY764) located on the C-terminal-most helix of the PolIIIa fingers (fingers helix a11) are well positioned to perform roles that are analogous to those played by F272 and Y271 in Polb, and this helix may also play a similar role in the selection of deoxyribonucleotide over ribonucleotides during polymerization. Four base pairs upstream (in the direction of the replicated DNA) of the primer terminus, the homologymodeled DNA clashes severely with the thumb and PHP domains (Figure 5B). It is unlikely that the orientation of the DNA in a ternary complex of PolIIIa would be significantly different from that observed in the Polb complex, since template-dependent DNA polymerases from all families bind their DNA substrate in similar orientations with respect to their polymerase domains (Figure S4). Therefore, we envisage that in complex with DNA, PolIIIa has a different orientation of its thumb and PHP domains. In fact, it has been observed that binding of duplex DNA to most DNA polymerases is accompanied by some reorientation of the thumb (Steitz and Yin, 2004). Indeed, the thumb of PolIIIa may be quite mobile, as the electron density describing this domain is weak. In addition to protein

The HhH motif and loops implicated in DNA binding are colored dark and light blue, respectively.

rearrangements, PolIIIa may also alleviate some of the clashes seen in the homology model by imposing a bend in the path of the DNA, as observed in the ternary complex of the T7 DNA polymerase (Doublie et al., 1998). If the PHP domain is indeed an editing 30 -50 exonuclease, then its active site must have access to the 30 primer terminus. The presumed PHP active site and the modeled ° 30 primer terminus are located approximately 35 A apart, as are the editing and polymerase sites of Klenow fragment, but in PolIIIa the two sites lie on opposite faces of the enzyme (Figure 5B). The PHP domain active site may be brought into a position where it could interact with an unwound 30 primer terminus by an as-yet-undefined conformational change, perhaps involving a rotation of the PHP domain about its interface with the palm. Alterna-

tively, in vivo the PHP domain could make use of an as-yet-uncharacterized editing activity, perhaps not requiring a major change in its orientation. Endonuclease IV, which in vivo is thought to catalyze the removal of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in the first step of base excision repair, also displays 30 -50 exonuclease activity in vitro (Kerins et al., 2003). During synthesis of an Okazaki fragment, the lagging strand polymerase will approach the 50 terminus of the primer bound to the downstream template (the DNA that has yet to be replicated). To gain insight into how close the polymerase active site can approach this 50 terminus without distortion of the polymerase DNA complex, we constructed a second homology model using the structure of human Polb complexed with nicked duplex DNA

substrate (Sawaya et al., 1997). As in Polb, the modeled downstream primer/template duplex sits on top of the fingers with its helical axis almost perpendicular to the helical axis of the upstream primer/template duplex (Figure S5). The downstream primer/template has no clashes with the protein and demonstrates that in the absence of the t subunit, PolIIIa should be able to accommodate the 50 terminus of the downstream primer such that only a nick between the upstream and downstream primers remains. Modeling the Interaction between PolIIIa and the Clamp A model of the interaction between the polymerase and its processivity factor, the b-sliding clamp, was built using the structures of PolIIIa and E. coli clamp (Kong et al., 1992). First, duplex DNA was docked onto the surface of the b binding domain such that the orientation of the duplex helical axis was consistent with other known HhH motif DNA complexes (Doherty et al., 1996). DNA modeled in this fashion heads from the polymerase active site to the internal b binding site lying across several loops found on the inside face of the b binding domain and produces no clashes with protein main chain (Figure 5C). The clamp was then positioned by passing this modeled DNA through its center and aligning its binding site for polymerase with the internal b binding site of the polymerase. The two sites were brought into van der Waals contact with each other. To accomplish this docking, the position of the internal b binding site of the polymerase was moved slightly, since this region appears quite flexible in the electron density maps. DISCUSSION Family C Polymerases as Members of the bNT Superfamily The structure of PolIIIa has established that family C polymerases are members of the bNT superfamily. All other members of this superfamily function in specialized roles that do not require high processivity (Aravind and Koonin, 1999), on average Polb only incorporates 1 nucleotide per binding event (Kunkel, 1985). In contrast, PolIIIa is a highly processive enzyme incorporating thousands of nucleotides per binding event in the presence of clamp and 10­20 nucleotides in the absence of clamp (Bloom et al., 1997). These observations demonstrate for the first time that a polynucleotide polymerase possessing the bNT fold is capable of highly processive synthesis. As the catalytic domains of the replicative polymerases of humans and eubacteria are not homologous, the eubacterial polymerase is a potentially antibacterial target. The structure of PolIIIa presented here therefore opens the door to the structure-based design of new antibiotics. A Structural Model of PolIIIa at the Replication Fork We have constructed models of PolIIIa with DNA bound at the polymerase active site and interacting with the b binding domain. Although individually both models are in good

agreement with existing biochemical information, the helical axis of the homology modeled primer/template DNA ° modeled at the polymerase active site is some 30 A from the HhH motif of the b binding domain (Figure 6A). The HhH motif may be brought into contact the primer/template DNA through a 30 rotation of the b binding domain about a potential hinge region that exists on the far side of a cleft formed by the interface between the fingers and b binding domains. Such a change would create a continuous binding surface for duplex DNA that extends from the polymerase active site across the b binding domain toward the center of the clamp (Figure 6A). This model positions approximately 20 base pairs between the 30 primer terminus and the near side of the clamp, which is consistent with previous fluorescence (Griep and McHenry, 1992) and DNA footprinting protection experiments (Reems and McHenry, 1994), as well as the positions of crosslinks between the clamp and primer strand of the primer/template DNA (Reems et al., 1995). The modeled closing of the b binding domain onto the duplex DNA product also facilitates the interaction of the CTD with the ssDNA template. In the structure of the apo enzyme, the anticipated path of the ssDNA template ° is 25 A away from the ssDNA binding site of the CTD (Figure 6B). As the two domains are connected, the modeled 30 rotation of the b binding domain would also move the CTD toward the ssDNA template. The resulting movement introduces clashes between the fingers and CTD. However, the b binding domain and the CTD are loosely tethered (with a buried surface area per monomer of ° only 290 A2) such that the CTD can easily be repositioned to bind the ssDNA template while avoiding clashes with the fingers domain (Figure 6B). In addition to interactions with the internal b binding site, clamp is also expected to interact with the C-terminal site of PolIIIa (Leu et al., 2003). It is unclear precisely what further conformational changes need to be made to the model described above to accommodate this additional constraint. In the current model, the C-terminal residue ° is 75 A away from the clamp's second polymerase binding site. Due to the disorder of the 15 C-terminal residues and because of the possible hinge within the CTD (Figure 4C), it is difficult to define the exact location of the C-terminal b binding site in a polymerase clamp complex. However, in the current model, there is no obvious steric occlusion of the clamp's second polymerase binding site. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of an interaction if there are significant conformational changes within the CTD between both polymerase b binding sites and the clamp. The Lagging Strand Processivity Switch It has been demonstrated that the t subunit is necessary to eject the polymerase from the clamp upon completion of an Okazaki fragment (Leu et al., 2003). To do this, the t subunit must break the interface between the clamp and the essential internal b binding site (Dohrmann and McHenry, 2005). The molecular mechanism through which

(A) (Left) DNA homology modeled onto the polymerase active site. The polymerase is shown as a surface representation colored similarly to Figure 2. The CTD is not shown for clarity. The modeled primer and template strands are gray and gold ribbons. (Right) The b binding domain has been rotated 30 such that the HhH motif binds the modeled DNA. The clamp, colored white, is positioned such that the modeled DNA passes through its center and its polymerase binding site is docked with the internal b binding site of the polymerase. The PHP has been rotated about its interface with the palm domain to alleviate clashes with the modeled DNA and the thumb has been reoriented to interact with the minor groove. (B) Same as (A), but including the CTD (colored red). In the left panel, the CTD has been repositioned such that the OB fold binds the single-stranded downstream template.

this occurs is unknown. Understanding it will undoubtedly require crystal structures of polymerase in complex with the t subunit. However, our analysis of the current structure predicts that the CTD may play a critical role in the recognition of the ssDNA template, as well as t subunit binding. Because the CTD OB fold selectively binds only ssDNA, we envisage a conformational change within the polymerase as the downstream RNA primer/template duplex approaches the polymerase active site. Thus, it appears that the CTD may act as a sensor for the nature of the DNA substrate at the polymerase active site. Evolution of Replicative DNA Polymerases The crystal structure of PolIIIa shows that though they share the common two-metal-ion mechanism exhibited by all polymerases, the catalytic domain of the replicative polymerase of eubacteria is not homologous to those of archaea and eukaryotes. This difference between the two families of polymerases raises interesting evolutionary

questions. Since the transcribing DNA-dependent RNA polymerases of eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes are homologous, it is probable that the last common ancestor (LCA) had a DNA genome. Why, then are the replicative DNA polymerases not homologous? One previously proposed possibility (Leipe et al., 1999) is that both polymerases existed in the LCA (perhaps one of them being responsible for repair) and that during subsequent evolution each lineage selected the respective polymerase we observe today. Speculation has also been made that DNA replication may have evolved independently twice in eubacteria and archaea/eukaryotes. In this scenario the LCA had a mixed RNA/DNA genome that was replicated by a reverse transcriptase which copied RNA into DNA in a manner similar to modern day retroid viruses (Leipe et al., 1999). We propose a third model in which a ribozyme DNA polymerase originating in the RNA world may have persisted beyond the divergence of eubacteria from archaea and eukaryotes. This RNA machine could

subsequently have been replaced domain by domain in each lineage with a different protein fold. This would not only explain why replication, arguably the first enzymatic activity of life, does not exhibit a homologous catalytic domain among kingdoms, but also why the fingers and thumb domains are not homologous among the families of DNA polymerases. We presume that the need to enzymatically replicate the genome (RNA or DNA) by a ribozyme polymerase preceded the evolution of the protein-synthesizing ribozyme, the ribosome. If ribozyme polymerases existed initially, the question is how long did they persist and did they include all classes of polymerases. The existence of many of the other DNAreplication proteins, such as clamp and clamp loader, in the LCA is consistent with the existence of a replicating DNA polymerase. Could this have been a ribozyme, replaced after the divergence of eubacteria from archaea/ eukaryotes by protein replicating polymerases? Although the catalytic domains of polymerases from families C and X are homologous, their evolutionary relationship is difficult to assess because sequence identities do not extend beyond a relatively small core of the palm domain. Even within this core, only six residues are conserved between PolIIIa and Polb. Five of these residues are conserved in all bNT family members, complicating sequence-based analysis. Additionally, the thumb domains of the two polymerases are connected to the palm at very different positions (Figure 3A). It therefore seems that PolIIIa and Polb, rather than forming a distinct branch of the bNT family, may share only a remote bNT ancestor. This would thus conform to a pattern which has been proposed for several bNT family members, in particular the class I and class II CCA adding enzymes (Aravind and Koonin, 1999).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning, Expression, and Purification The gene encoding full-length Taq PolIIIa was cloned into the expression vector pET22b. For expression, the resulting plasmid was transformed into B834(DE3) cells and grown at 20 C for 25 hr in Casamino acids and glycerol-supplemented M9 media that contained 1 mM IPTG. For purification (see Supplemental Data for buffer compositions) the cells were lysed in a microfluidizer and incubated at 65 C for 20 min to denature the majority of host cell proteins, which were then removed by centrifugation. The polymerase was further purified over three chromatography steps: heparin-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and a G200 gel filtration column. The final protein was more than 99% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Before crystallization, the protein was dialyzed into 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Crystallization and Data Collection Both crystal forms were grown in the presence of primer/template DNA (primer sequence TCAGGCGCG; template sequence ATGCGCGC CTGA) by the hanging-drop method of vapor diffusion, using well solutions consisting of 20%­25% (w/v) PEG 550 MME, 250 mM NaCl, and 100 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.0­6.5). Before flash freezing in liquid propane, crystals were transferred into a solution of 35% PEG 550 MME. Data were integrated and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997).

Structure Determination and Refinement The PolIIIa structure was solved using two separate crystal forms by the single isomorphous replacement method. Derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals in 100 mM ethyl mercury phosphate. Mercury atom positions were found using the direct methods procedure, as implemented in the program SnB (Weeks and Miller, 1999). Phases were refined in SHARP (Bricogne et al., 2003) and improved by cross crystal averaging and solvent flattening using DMMULTI (CCP4, 1994). The maps were further improved by temperature-factor sharpening. Models were built using the program O (Jones et al., 1991) and refinement performed in REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). Because there were no significant differences between the initial models of the P212121 and C2221 crystal forms and since the quality and resolution of the P212121 maps were much lower than the C2221 maps, refinement was only pursued with the C2221 crystals. The final model accounts for 1158 out of the 1220 residues of Taq PolIIIa.
