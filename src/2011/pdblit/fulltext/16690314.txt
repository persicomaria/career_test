Abstract--(R)-Configured isophthalic hydroxyethylamines play an important role in the inhibition of b-secretase (BACE1). We present the synthesis of a number of (S)-configured hydroxyethylamine derivatives via 2-iodoethanol intermediates and the comparison with the (R)-analogues. An N-substituted indole was investigated as a substitute for the isophthalamide moiety. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Extracellular amyloid-b plaques are suspected to cause Alzheimer's disease.1,2 These plaques consist mainly of amyloid-b peptides (Ab) which are generated from the membrane bound APP (amyloid precursor protein) via the consecutive cleavages by b-secretase (BACE1, b-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme) and c-secretase.3 Thus, the inhibition of BACE1 constitutes a promising approach to block the onset of plaque formation by decreasing the Ab levels in the brain. A number of highly potent, but peptidic BACE1 inhibitors have been available for several years.4,5 Inhibitors 1­3 have derived from the progressive elimination of peptidic features from the original heptapeptidic hydroxyethylenes (Fig. 1). The introduction of an isophthalic moiety in 1 was regarded as a milestone in the development of small BACE1 inhibitors.6 The peptidic character of compound 1 was further reduced by the replacement of the hydroxyethylene with a hydroxyethylamine. Remarkably, the hydroxyethylamine in 2 is the only transition state isostere in BACE1 inhibitors that displays an (R)-configured secondary alcohol.7 Compound 3 comprises a reduced amide transition state isostere with an additional sulfonamide

They are good substrates for the p-glycoprotein transporter, this was partially assigned to the isophthalic amide moiety.9 Here, we present an approach to isophthalamide based hydroxyethylamines and potential replacements thereof. We compared a linear to a convergent access to this class of compounds. The synthesis led to the (S)-configured secondary alcohols which were compared to the known (R)-analogue 2. Furthermore, we investigated

an indole as a replacement for the isophthalamide portion, combined it with a reduced amide isostere and compared it to the isophthalamide analogue. A reaction sequence starting from diester 4a was employed for the generation of 5a, 6a and finally the isophthalamide 7a comprising two different amide substituents on either carboxyl functionality (Fig. 2).10 Alcohol 7a was oxidized by IBX (2-iodooxybenzoic acid) furnishing aldehyde 8a in a high yield and free of racemisation. The aldehyde was converted to a 2-iodoethanol using a moderately stereoselective C1-homologation.11 The reaction occurs upon treatment with i-PrMgCl/CH2I2 forming a mild Grignard reagent that undergoes addition to peptidic aldehydes in a high chemoselectivity leaving the a-chiral position unchanged. Product 9a (crude ds = 3:1) was obtained in 75% yield as a diastereomeric mixture and further purification delivered pure 9a. Treatment of 9a with K2CO3 yielded epoxide 10a. Surprisingly, 9a was converted to oxazine 11a upon treatment with any benzylamine in MeCN under reflux. 11a could be opened to ester 12 by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in a water/THF mixture. A small amount of the diastereomer of 11a was generated likewise, and the cyclic structures of both diastereomers of 11a served to assign the configuration of compounds 9­12. The reactions to the analogous compounds 5b­11b starting from dimethyl 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate 4b were conducted in a similar manner. The higher yield of 9b (de = 100%) compared to 9a is explained by the higher diastereoselectivity of the C1-homologation (crude ds = 9:1). Even though the generation of 9a or 9b seemed to be a promising approach for a variety of benzylic hydroxyethylamines, the iodo compounds reacted under a variety of conditions to the undesired oxazines. This undesired reaction was circumvented in previous synthetic approaches:12 (a) by the protection of the amide nitrogen or (b) by the conversion of an N-Boc-protected amino acid deriv-

ative (e.g., 15) or its respective epoxide, which does not undergo cyclization. This difference in carbamate versus amide reactivity was applied to the synthesis of the desired hydroxyethylamines. Boc-phenylalaninol 13 was oxidized to 14 with IBX and converted to b-iodoethanols 15a and 15b (de >99%, crude ds = 3:2, Fig. 3). Either diastereomer was obtained in high purity from the crude diastereomeric mixture (53%). Substitution of the iodide by various benzylamines provided hydroxyethylamines 16. Deprotection and reaction with chloride 6a led to the desired (S)-configured alcohols 17­20 and (R)-alcohol 2. The configuration was assigned by single crystal X-ray analysis of 15a and subsequent conversions of 15b to known compounds and comparison of the NMR data.11

Epoxides 10a, 10b, oxazine 11a, ester 12 and hydroxyethylamines 2, 17­20 were tested in BACE1-assays (fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay,13 RLBA (radioactive ligand binding assay)14 in the presence of detergent (Tween 20) or serum albumin (BSA)) and a FRET Cathepsin D assay13 (Table 1). The epoxides proved to be inhibitors equally of both BACE1 and Cathepsin D. In further studies using the RLBA assay compound 10a showed an irreversible, time-dependent inhibition. The apparent IC50 was 39 lM after 10 min and 3 lM after 60 min incubation. The same compound was not active in a cellular system measuring Ab production by HEK293 cells. Compound 11a was investigated because of the structural similarity to an oxazole reported by Rajapakse et al.15 While the oxazole was inactive, its hydrolyzed linear form was a highly potent inhibitor. Similar to the oxazole, oxazine 11a displayed no inhibition of BACE1 and its ring-opened derivative 12 was a moderate inhibitor of BACE1. Interestingly, the (S)-configured hydroxyethylamines displayed no inhibition of BACE1. This proves the importance of the opposite (R)-configuration on the secondary alcohol in hydroxyethylamines compared to other transition state isosteres. In search of an isophthalamide replacement we and others12,16 hypothesized that the indole nitrogen in a (4-amino-6-carboxyl)-indole (e.g., 23) could be attached to an alkyl substituent mimicking the P3 residue, while the amine functionality can be converted into a sulfonamide and the carboxylate serves as a linker to a transition state isostere. Such indoles display H-bonds and thus may exhibit a reduced affinity for the p-glycoprotein transporter9 and the enhanced rigidity might increase their activity. The synthesis started from the C2-symmetrical acid 21 (Fig. 4). After esterification, an enamine was generated that underwent cyclization to the indole in a subsequent Pd/C catalyzed reduction.17 The resulting amine was converted into a methyl sulfonamide and the amide nitrogen was methylated after selective deprotonation. After a second deprotonation, the indole nitrogen was alkylated with i-BuI and the ester was saponified to furnish building block 25.

A reduced amide transition state isostere was chosen for elongation. Coburn et al.8 reported on a variety of reduced amides similar to 3 and two of the most active isosteres were generated via reductive amination based on a Z-strategy. Z-L -alanine 27 was coupled with i-BuNH2 or cyclopropylamine (c-PrNH2) to the respective amides (Fig. 5). The resulting amides were deprotected and converted to 28a and 28b by treatment with N-Z-L -phenylalaninal and Na(AcO)3BH. The primary amines were deprotected to provide the transition state isosteres 29a and 29b. Compound 29b was coupled to indole 25 in a final step leading to inhibitor 26. The secondary amine 29a was coupled with 6a to provide compound 30 in order to compare the activity of indole 26 with other P2­P3 mimetics. Indole 26 is active at micromolar concentrations and exhibits a similar activ-

ity like isophthalamide 30 (Table 1). Surprisingly, this results in an approximately 1000-fold decreased activity compared to amide 3 (IC50 = 24 nM). In conclusion, we confirmed the (S)-configured hydroxyethylamines to be inactive and thus to constitute an exception to all other transition state isosteres employed in BACE1 inhibition. However, (S)-configured hydroxyethylamines are known as isosteres in inhibitors targeting other aspartyl proteases. The depicted C1homologation resulted in useful intermediates for such protease inhibitors. The direct nucleophilic opening of acyl N-protected a-aminoepoxides is an attractive synthesis to bioactive molecules, but turned out to be inaccessible. However, the initially undesired cyclization allowed us to unambiguously establish the stereochemistry due to cyclic constraints. The combination of an indole bearing an i-butyl P3 residue and a methyl sulfonamide P2 residue proved equally potent as the N,Ndipropylisophthalamide analogue, but neither of the compounds displayed activities comparable to the most potent BACE1 inhibitors.
