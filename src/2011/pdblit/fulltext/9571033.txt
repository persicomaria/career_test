Abstract The crystal structure of human recombinant poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) complexed with a potent inî hibitor, FR257517, was solved at 3.0 A resolution. The £uorophenyl part of the inhibitor induces an amazing conformational change in the active site of PARP by motion of the side chain of the amino acid, Arg878, which forms the bottom of the active site. Consequently, a corn-shaped hydrophobic subsite, which consists of the side chains of Leu769, Ile879, Pro881, and the methylene chain of Arg878, newly emerges from the well-known active site. ß 2003 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP: EC 2.4.2.30), a eukaryotic DNA-binding enzyme that participates in cell recovery from DNA damage [1], consists of three functional domains: an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a C-terminal catalytic domain (catPARP) and a central automodi¢cation domain [2]. PARP binds to and is activated by DNA strand breaks and catalyzes the synthesis of homopolymers of ADPribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADþ ) onto nuclear acceptor proteins. PARP itself is the main protein acceptor (automodi¢cation), but the enzyme has also been shown to modify histones, topoisomerases, DNA polymerases and ligases [3]. The formation of these negatively charged polymers in the vicinity of the DNA nick is thought to cause electrostatic repulsion of PARP from the DNA and to facil-

itate recruitment of the base excision repair complex [4]. The ADP-ribose polymers formed by PARP are cleaved by the cellular hydrolase poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase. PARP activation and the rapid synthesis and degradation of ADP polymers can result in abrupt and profound cellular NADþ depletion. Cytotoxic drugs or radiation can induce activation of PARP, and it has been demonstrated that inhibitors of PARP can potentiate the DNA-damaging and cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and irradiation [5]. Because of the essential function of PARP for cellular repair and survival, evaluation of the potential of novel, potent PARP inhibitors for the treatment of cancer in combination with selected cytotoxic agents has been sought. These inhibitors have been designated to mimic the substrate^protein interactions of NADþ and PARP using the crystal structure of chicken catPARP [6^8]. The active site of PARP is very large and can be generally classi¢ed into two sites: the acceptor site and the donor site [6]. The acceptor site is occupied by the ADP moiety of the poly(ADP-ribose) chain. The donor site is occupied by NADþ , and conveniently classi¢ed into the three subsites consisting of the nicotinamide-ribose binding site (NI site), the phosphate binding site (PH site) and the adenine-ribose binding site (AD site). Known inhibitors bind to the NI site, partially bind to the acceptor site and do not bind to the PH site and/or AD site. FR257517 (Fig. 1), 2-{3-[4-(4-£uorophenyl)3,6-dihydro-1(2H)-pyridinyl]propyl}-8-methyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone, a potent inhibitor with an IC50 value of 14 nM, has a quinazolinone part as a nicotinamide mimic moiety. It is strongly suggested that the quinazolinone part of the inhibitor binds to the NI site based upon structural studies up to this point. The other part of the inhibitor is unique and much larger than other known inhibitors. Based upon a docking study, it was assumed that the inhibitor cannot bind to the acceptor site and/or the AD site without an enforced molec-

ular-kink. Thus, it was proposed that FR257517 induces a structural change to the active site of PARP when the inhibitor binds. In order to clarify this hypothesis, we performed an X-ray analysis of the catalytic domain of human catPARP complexed with FR257517. 2. Materials and methods
The human catPARP gene corresponding to amino acid numbers 654^1016 was PCR ampli¢ed with a fused protein, glutathione S-transferase, and a thrombin cleavage site. Luria broth medium was inoculated with the DH5K Escherichia coli strain containing the catPARP construct. The cells were harvested by centrifugation. The suspension was sonicated and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was puri¢ed with a glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia) incubated after addition of thrombin. The catPARP protein was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR (Amersham Pharmacia) size-exclusion column. Homogeneous protein was puri¢ed from this column by isocratic elution with bu¡er: 50 mM Tris^HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7.5. The inhibitor FR257517 was suspended in the protein solution. The excess inhibitor was removed by centrifugation before crystallization. Initial crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor-di¡usion method using a Crystal Screen kit (Hampton Research). Crystals were obtained under the No. 39 conditions, which were re¢ned using the sitting-drop vapor-di¡usion method. The best crystals were obtained using 4 Wl of complex solution, which was mixed with 4 Wl mother liquor containing 2.1^2.2 M ammonium sulfate, 2% PEG400, 0.1 M Tris^HCl at pH 8.5. Details of the puri¢cation and crystallization procedure have been described elsewhere [9]. The crystal was mounted in a nylon loop (Hampton Research) and cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen gas stream. Di¡raction dataset was collected at beamline 6B (Photon Factory) using an imaging plate î detector [10]. A wavelength of 1.00 A and a crystal-to-detector distance of 573 mm were used. Data integration was performed with DENZO and scaling and merging were performed using SCALEPACK; both programs are from the HKL program package [11]. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the program AMoRe [12] in the CCP4 program suite. The homology model calculated based upon chicken catPARP was used as a search probe. The program Quanta (Accelrys) was used for model building and CNX (Accelrys) for structure re¢nement. To obtain the conformation of FR257517 in binding to the protein, several di¡erent conformations that ¢t the residual density in the electron density omit map were subjected to geometrical optimization using the CHARMm force ¢eld and CHARMm minimization module of Quanta (Accelrys). The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code is 1UK0).

3. Results and discussion Human catPARP crystallized in space group C2 with unit î î î cell dimensions of a = 179.82 A, b = 53.55 A, c = 92.01 A, and L = 114.4 and with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The

¢nal model including two inhibitors, one inhibitor per PARP î molecule, has been re¢ned to 3.0 A. Several amino acids, eight amino acids from the N-terminus and ¢ve amino acids from the C-terminus, were omitted from the ¢nal model because of ambiguous or discontinuous electron density for the corresponding regions. However, both terminal portions are located at the opposite side of the active site and are irrelevant to the enzymatic activity. The R factor and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) bond lengths and angles reveal a rather low accuracy, but structural features involving inhibitor^protein interaction can be extracted from the ¢nal model. Data collection and re¢nement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The overall structure of human catPARP is similar to that of chicken catPARP. Thus, architectures of both catPARP are î conserved with 0.98 A RMSD for the CK atoms of both catPARP (Fig. 2). Furthermore, amino acids around the active site of both PARP species are perfectly conserved, therefore, it is presumed that both PARP species will have a close resemblance when bound by an inhibitor. The inhibitor could easily ¢t into the di¡erence electron density map, and this resulted in the inhibitor bound to the active site. Thus, the inhibitor mainly binds to the NI and AD subsites of the donor site, and does not bind the acceptor site

Illustrated closed-up views of the active site of catPARP with the same orientation as Fig. 2. a: The active site of PARP can be generally classi¢ed into two sites: the acceptor site (pink) and the donor site (blue). The acceptor site is occupied by the ADP moiety of the poly(ADP-ribose) chain. The donor site is occupied by NADþ , and conveniently classi¢ed into the three subsites consisting of the NI site, the PH site and the AD site. b: The inhibitor in the new active site.

at all, although known inhibitors utilize the acceptor site. The PH site, highly capable of forming hydrogen bonds, is also unused. The quinazolinone part of the inhibitor as a nicotinamide mimic moiety tightly binds to the NI site by three hydrogen

bonds (CNO to Ser904OQ and Gly863NH; NH to Gly863CNO) and by a sandwiched hydrophobic interaction consisting of a Z^Z interaction with the phenyl ring of Tyr907 and a CH^Z interaction with CL of Tyr869. The methylene part of the inhibitor, positioning at the place corresponding to di-

phosphate in comparison of chemical structures, does not participate in direct or indirect binding but passes through the PH site. In other words, this part is located at an intermediate position between the acceptor and the donor. It is therefore assumed that the methylene moiety is a spacer to introduce the pyridine moiety and the £uorophenyl group of the inhibitor to the AD site. The pyridine moiety of the inhibitor interacts by van der Waals contacts with Asn767, Asp770, Asp796, Asn868 and Ala880 in the AD site. Additionally, space adjacent to the pyridine moiety remains and a water molecule is located there. The remaining space occupied by the water molecule may be primed for binding of a part of the adenine framework. It was originally unknown how the £uorophenyl part of the inhibitor induced the conformational change of catPARP, although the adenosine site was too narrow for the binding. It is known that the AD site is at the bottom of the active site and surrounds the adenine moiety at the terminus of substrate NADþ (Fig. 3a). Without a conformational change, the £uorophenyl part would cause serious steric-crushes with the protein. Consequently, the £uorophenyl part of the inhibitor induces an amazing conformational change of the AD site. This induced ¢tting of the inhibitor enlarges the AD site and breaks the bottom of the active site (Fig. 3b). Accordingly, the £uorophenyl group, the terminal part of the inhibitor, can be seen from the opposite side of the active site. Naturally, no portion can be seen from the opposite side of the active site in the known conformation. What is the reason for this large structural change? The backbone structures around the critical portion are fully conserved as mentioned, but the side chain of amino acid Arg878, which forms the bottom of the AD site of the active site, moves greatly upon inhibitor binding. Surprisingly, the motion of a single amino acid induces this large structural change. This also results in generation of a new hydrophobic subsite with a corn shape, consisting of the side chains of Leu769, Ile879, Pro881, and the methylene chain of Arg878. In summary, we have discovered a novel conformation for catPARP containing a corn-shaped hydrophobic subsite. This

observation provides a new concept in inhibitor design using the emerged hydrophobic site, which is located on the opposite side of the active site and therefore has been unused in inhibitor design so far.
