(Received 29 January 1990; accepted 7 July 1990)
We report the localization of the proteins gp7, gp8 and gpl0 in the bacteriophage T4 baseplate. Proceeding on the assumption that these proteins occupy discrete locations, we have decorated baseplates and tails with immunological probes. Using 5 nm diameter colloidal gold :F(ab')2 conjugates, we show that proteins gp7 and gpl0 are located directly at the vertex, with gpl0 positioned in the pin directly below gp7. gp8 is located beside gp7 towards the centre of the baseplate. Using a novel undecagold : Fab' conjugate we have also determined the radial positions of gp7 and gp8 in baseplates that have transformed to stars. A mechanism for the nature of the hexagon-to-star transformation is proposed.

This transformation is believed to trigger the contraction The virions of many bacterial viruses have tails of the tail sheath (Kellenberger & Boy de la Tour, that enhance the infectivity of the virus. These tails 1964; Moody, 1973; Caspar, 1980), which in turn vary considerably from phage to phage in both their causes the tail core to be driven through the basesize and complexity (Joklik, 1985; Dimmock & plate and into the cell (Simon & Anderson, 1967a,b).

Watts et al. (c) Preparation of colloidal gold : F ( ab') 2 conjugates Colloidal gold particles (5 nm mean diameter), (Au 5.mr) were prepared according to Tschopp d al. (1982) with the following modifications. All solutions were made with deionized 0"2 ~um filtered water and all glassware was siliconized. Water (40 ml) was prechilled in an ice bath. To this was added 100/~l of 1% (v/v) tetrachloroauric acid (BDH Chemicals) and 33 #l of 0"2 M-K2CO3. Then 2"0ml of 0"5 mg sodium borohydride/ml was quickly injected while the solution was vigorously stirred with a magnetic stir bar. The solution immediately turned a light tan colour and after 1 min began to turn pink, with a final pH of 9"1. After 2 h at 4°C the solution had turned a bright ros~, As30 = 0"4. This preparation was suitable for conjugation to antibody fragments without further purification. For conjugation with the colloidal gold, F(ab')2 were prepared from anti-gp7, anti-gp8 and anti-gpl0 polyclonal antisera (generously provided by Dr Peter Berget) in the following way. IgG were isolated from 500 #l of serum with a l'0-ml, 5-0 cm long Protein A-Sepharose CIAB column (Pharmacia, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The buffer in the immunoglobin fraction was changed to 20 mM-sodium acetate (pH4"5) with a Sephadex G25 column, and the IgG were then immediately digested for 40 min at 37°C by tumbling with 1001ti (settled bed) of immobilized pepsin (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) in microcentrifuge tubes rotated at l0 revs/min in an incubator, whereafter the resin was removed by 3 successive brief centrifugations in a mierocentrifuge. The supernatant, buffer was changed to 5 mM-Tris" HCI (pH 7.4) by passage over the Sephadex G25 column and then the Fc and undigested IgG were removed with a short Protein A column. The buffer in the F(ab')2 fraction was then changed to 1 mM-Tris. HCl (pH 7"4) with the Sephadex G25 column as described above. Typical recoveries of 1-0 ml, A2s o - 0"2 were obtained. The amount of F(ab')2 required to stabilize the colloidal gold (Goodman et al., 1981; Roth, 1983) was determined by titration. Typically, 5 Izl quantities of F(ab')2, serially diluated (2-fold) with deionized water, were added to 200-/~1 portions of colloidal gold. After 15 min, 50/al of 4 M-NaCI was added. The stabilizing ratio of F(ab')2: Aus, m (the quantity at which the gold sol failed to turn blue upon addition of the NaCl) was typically found to be 1 : 200, iv/v). The appropriate amount of F(ab')2 was then diluted to l'0 ml with deionized water and added dropwise to l0 mi of stirred colloidal gold at room temperature. After 15 rain, 1"0 ml of 1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol Mr = 20,000 was added (Roth, 1983). The F(ab')2:Aus. m conjugate was then purified by 3 cycles of centrifugation at 38,000 revs]min for 1"25h at 4°C in a Ti75 rotor (Beckman). The loose sediment was resuspended each time in 50/~l of TEA buffer containing 0"1% polyethylene glycol. The resultant probes were then added to the T4 structures and incubated overni'ght at room temperature. A 1:20 gold conjugate:T4 structure mixture typically gave A53o = 0"15 to 0"2. Controls were made in the same way but with F(ab')2 derived from non-immune sera. After overnight incubation, the samples were passed over a 10-ml, 16 cm long column of Sephacryl $400 (Sigma

products, followed by the assembly of the tail core and sheath (for a review of T4 tail assembly and structure, see Berget & King, 1983). Image enhancement of electron micrographs of intact hexagons and stars has revealed the morphology of these structures to about 3 nm resolution (Crowther et al., 1977). F r o m the analysis of structures deficient in specific components, these authors were able to identify the location of the three peripheral proreins, gp9, g p l I and gpl2, which together constitute about 3 0 % of the mass of the baseptate. However, little is known of the positions of the majority of the proteins comprising this organelle, or even which portion of the baseplate is occupied by a wedge. We have observed t h a t chemical cross-linking of baseplate proteins leads to the formation of complexes t h a t reflect the order of assembly of these proteins (Watts & Coombs, 1989, 1990). In other words, nearest neighbours in the p a t h w a y are nearest neighbours in the structure. This observation suggested t h a t the proteins are globular rather than filamentous, because extended proteins would have been expected to make contacts beyond the rigid limits imposed by the pathway. This led us to the conclusion t h a t the proteins occupy discrete positions in the baseplate, and t h a t it should, therefore, be possible to locate the proteins with immunological probes. We have, therefore, begun to investigate the locations of specific proteins by immunogold electron microscopy and have located the positions of gene products 7, 8 and l0 in intact hexagons and tails using colloidal gold:F(ab')2 conjugates, gp7 and gp8 in stars using a novel undecagold : Fab' probe, and gp7 and g p l 0 in hexagons using unlabelled antibodies.

2. Materials and Methods
(a) Bacterial and phage strains E. coli CR63 and S]6 were used for the permissive and non-permissive plating conditions, respectively. E. coli B was used as the restrictive host for liquid culture. The mutant bacteriophage amBlT(23-), amB17{23-) x amNG524(19-), amB17(23-) x amNG524(19-) x amN69(12-) and amA455(34-) x amN52(37-) were employed to produce tails, baseplates, stars and fibreless phage, respectively. (b) Preparation of 35S-labelled structures Phage and phage parts were prepared essentially as described (Watts & Coombs, 1989, 1990). Briefly, B c cells, garown in M9 medium, were infected and labelled with [ $ S]cysteine and [3 5 S]methionine. All phage parts were isolated on 50 mM-triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8-0), 1 mM-MgSO+ (TEA) buffered sucrose gradients that contained 100 mM-NaC1 to reduce non-specific interaction with the immunogold probes. Baseplates and §tars were located by scintillation counting of portions from the gradient fractions while tails and phage were located visually. The buffer was changed to TEA by passing samples over a 2-5-ml, 4-0 cm long Sephadex G25 column. Typically, the A2so of these final preparations was 0"1, 0"35 and 1'3 for baseplates, tails and phage, respectively.

Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) equilibrated with TEA buffer (or 1"5 x M9 salts, 1 mM-MgSO4, in the case of tails) to remove unbound probe. Grids were made for examination by conventional transmission electron microscopy. (d) Preparation of undecagold-labelled Fab' Baseplates were also probed with undecagold (11 gold atom cluster) labelled Fab' (Hainfeld, 1987, 1988, 1989). F(ab')2 were prepared from anti-gp7 and anti-gp8 antisera as described above. These were reduced with 20 mM-dithiothreitol for 2 h at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere and the dithiothreitol was removed by high-pressure liquid chromatography using a Dupont Zorbax GF-250 column equilibrated with 0"2 M-sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The Fab' were then mixed with a 2-fold molar excess of freshly prepared monomaleimidopropyl-Aull and allowed to react overnight at 4°C. The unreacted undecagold was removed by high-pressure liquid chromatography using the same column and buffer as above. The purified undecagold : Fab' probes (0-04 mg) were concentrated with an Amicon Centricon-30 microconcentrator to 50 ~l and mixed with baseplates (250 #l, A2s o - 0"05) in 100 mM-ammonium acetate and incubated at 37 °C for 1"5 h. Baseplates were then freed of unbound probe by passage over a Sephacryl $300 column equilibrated with 100 mM-ammonium acetate. The baseplate peak etuting after the void volume was applied to titanium grids and processed for scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis as described (Mosesson et al., t981; Wall & Hainfeld, 1986). Tobacco mosaic virus particles were included in all preparations as internal calibration standards.

ible surface of the protein(s). I t is for this reason that the ranges appear disproportionate in the case of the y values. The small y values merely indicate that the centre of the cluster of points is close to the x-axis. The range associated with the y value is not a measure of uncertainty of that y value but rather an estimate of the dispersion of the data along the y-axis. I n order to locate the positions o f ' ~ 7 and gpl0 along the pins, gold probes were attached to tails, which provide a side-on view of the baseplate. When tails adhere to the grid, however, their axial rotation is more or less random, with the pins in various stages of alignment. Consequently, gold particles targeted toward gp7 and gpl0 appear from side t o side on the baseplate and at various positions up and down the pins. In order to record the positions of the gold particles, the average outline of 20 tails was obtained. The positions of the gold probes were then recorded after bringing this outline into optimal register with the projected tail image. The outline was then divided into sections perpendicular to the long axis of the pins and with a spacing corresponding to 3 nm on the tail. The mean of the frequency distribution of gold particles falling into each of the sections was taken to define the centre of each gene product along the axis of the pin. The results are summarized in Table 1. (f) Electron microscopic analysis (STEM) Baseplates probed with the undeeagold:Fab conjugates were examined at the Brookhaven Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) Biotechnology Resource. The preparation of carbon films, specimen application and processing, and STEM have been described in detail (Mosesson et al., 1981; Wall & Hainfeld, 1986). In order to determine the radial frequency distribution of the undecagold markers on the images of baseplates, a transparent overlay with concentric rings with a spacing corresponding to 2 nm on the baseplate was centred on the baseplate and the position of the gold particles recorded. (g) Immunofflobin cross-linkinff of baseplates Purified polyclonal anti-gp7 IgG (A280=0-2) was mixed with baseplates (A2s o = 0"1) at ratios of 1 : 10 to 1:50, (v/v) and incubated overnight at room temperature. The samples were then passed over a Sephacryt $400 column to remove unbound IgG and subsequently examined in the CTEM.

(e ) Electron microscopic analysis ( CT E M )
For analysis using a conventional transmission electron microscope (CTEM), samples were applied to carboncoated copper grids, made hydrophilic by glow discharge in an argon atmosphere, and negatively stained with 1 °/o (w/v) uranyl acetate. The grids were examined in a Philips EM400T operating at 80 kV. Images were recorded on 35 mm film (Fine Grain Positive Release, Kodak) with a 1-5 s exposure and an emulsion setting of 6 to improve the visibility of the gold. All images were recorded at an instrument magnification of 52,000 ×. To plot the distribution of gold particles on the baseplates, negatives were projected with an enlarger onto a hexagon drawn with the same dimensions as the projected baseptate. The centres of the individual gold particles were then recorded after first aligning the hexagon to optimally fit the projected baseplate image. Baseplates can attach to grids in either of 2 orientations; that is, with the pins either facing or projecting away from the support film. The orientations of the various baseplates in a given field were readily determined by comparison of their staining characteristics (Crowther et al., 1977). Right and left-handed images, were then scored onto separate outlines. The data were later pooled at one vertex by inversion of the point distribution from the left-hand images. To obtain the mean position of each collection of related points, the hexagonal outlines were overlaid with a Cartesian co-ordinate system with the x-y origins at the centre of the hexagon and with the x-axis drawn through a vertex. The results are summarized in Table 1. I t should be noted that the range values are estimates of the distribution of the probes about the centre of the access-

The scale bar represents l0 nm. adhere to the gold particles at a site other than the antigen binding site, the maximum distance from antigen binding site to gold particle centre is 15 nm. This probe would be large relative to the baseplate. However, observation of negatively stained free probes in the electron microscope showed t h a t the gold particles were surrounded by a layer up to 5 nm thick, considerably thinner than t h a t expected from the assumptions above (not shown). The thin haloes of protein around the gold particles are readily discerned in several cases in Figure 3. Thus the actual resolution achieved would also exceed the expected values. Two different structures were treated with the probe; baseplates, which lie fiat on the grid, were used to determine the positions of the proteins within the plane of the hexagon, and tails, in which the baseplate is tilted normal to the grid surface, permitted visualization of the bound antibody in the third dimension. Baseplates were incubated with either anti-gpT, anti-gp8 or anti-gpi0 probes. In most cases, only one, or a few, gold particles were found to be attached to any one baseplate (Fig. l(a), (b), (c), respectively). In almost all cases, the gold particles were located at or near a vertex. This is in agreement with the prediction t h a t these three proteins, which are the first to join together to initiate wedge assembly, are probably located at the periphery of the baseplate (Kikuchi & King, 1975a; Berget & King, 1978; Plishker et al., 1983, 1988).

The x, y and z values are the 3 spatial co-ordinates of the g e n e products (in nm) determined as described in Materials and Methods. The x-y values are the abscissae and ordinates in a coordinate system that is coplanar with the top of the baseplate, with the origin at the centre of the hexagon and the x-axis drawn through a hexagonal vertex. Thus x values of 0 and 22"5 represent the centre and the outer edge of a vertex, respectively. Negative y values indicate that the centre of the gene product is positioned clockwise from the x-axis when the baseplate is viewed from the top. The z values are the distances that the g e n e l)roducts are located below the x-y plane towards the bottom of the ])in.

The scale bar represents 10 nm. plates linked by anti-gpl0 antibodies would tend to be separated by a greater distance than those linked by anti-gp7 antibodies. Tails, which afford a side view of the baseplate, were used to determine the arrangement of gp7 and gpl0 perpendicular to the plane of the baseplate (Fig. 3). Enlargements of the tails were divided into sections parallel to the plane of the baseplate as described in Materials and Methods. As can be seen from the frequency distribution of the number of gold particles falling into each of the sections (Fig. 4), gp7 is located close to the upper surface of the baseplate while gpl0 is farther down (Table 1). A combination of the two views of the proteins shows that gp7 is located at the vertex, while gpl0 is directly below it in the pin (Fig. 5(a) and (b)) thus confirming this position for gpl0 as proposed (Crowther et al., 1977). gpl 1 has been shown to form the distal portion of the pins (Crowther et al., 1977). A model of the wedge, based on chemical crosslinking data (Watts & Coombs, 1989, 1990), is shown for comparison (Fig. 5(e) and (d)). using a finer immunological label. Such a label has been described (Hainfeld, 1987, 1988, 1989). This probe consists of Fab' tagged with a 0"8nm diameter 11 gold atom cluster located 4"5 nm from the antigen binding site and is significantly smaller than any probes employing colloidal metal. Fab', bearing a single sulphydryl group at the end opposite the antigen binding site, were prepared by reduction of anti-gp7 and anti-gp8 F(ab'h with dithiothreitol (Martin et al., 1981). Following removal of the dithiothreitol, the Fab' were reacted with activated gold clusters (Hainfeld, 1987) and then freed of any unbound gold. Baseplates decorated with these markers were examined in the STEM as described (Mosesson et al., 1981; Wall & Hainfeld, 1986; and see Fig. 6). The absence of negative stain, necessitated by the incompatibility of the stain with the visualization of such a small probe caused all the wild-type baseplates to spontaneously transform to a star conformation during grid preparation {Fig. 6(a) and (b)). This occurred even when the baseplates were stabilized with glutaraldehyde. These stars have the normal 6-fold symmetry and measure 60 nm and 30nm across the major and minor diameter, respectively, as do normal and g p l 2 - stars prepared with negative stain (Fig. 6(e) to (f)). None of the freeze-dried particles appears to have a hole in the centre, nor do they have a discernible handedness,

Because tails attach to grids in various orientations, only the distances of the gold particles from the top of the baseplate were recorded, as described in Materials and Methods. The mean positions of the anti-gp7 and anti-gpl0 colloidal gold particles are 7 nm and 13 nm below the top of the baseplate, respectively. Negative values indicate particles located above the plane of the baseplate.

unlike stars embedded in negative stain (Crowther et

al., 1977).
Occasionally, structures were observed t h a t appeared to have only partially undergone the hexagon-to-star transformation (see the last panel in Fig. 6(a)). The upper half of this image is strongly reminiscent of hexagons, while the lower half has already transformed to the star form. There are lines of electron density connecting the central hub with the vertices in a spoke-like arrangement, which

gives the baseplate a "webbed f o o t " appearance and may represent the mass of the wedges. Unlike baseplates prepared with negative stain, these structures show no readily discernible hand. The upper hexagonal portion also appears to be slightly smaller than the lower half. This agrees with the observation t h a t hexagons have a smaller diameter (45 nm) than stars (60nm) when prepared with negative stain {Crowther et ai., 1977). However, an accurate measurement of the hexagon-like portions was not possible due to the very low frequency at which untransformed sectors were found. Undecagold clusters are not visible in the CTEM but were observable in the STEM (Hainfeld, 1988}. The visibility of gold clusters varied somewhat, particularly where superimposed on protein. As a result, spots were more readily discerned at the periphery of the stars than towards the interior. The identity of all gold clusters was verified by observing the size of the spot at high magnification and by verifying t h a t the particle had a high atomic n u m b e r {which scatters preferentially to the largeangle detector}. In our final analysis, gold clusters were assigned to either of two classes; (1} identified with complete certainty and (2)good candidates. The radial frequency distribution for each of these two classes is shown in Figure 7. The means and ranges for all points, for both baseplate proteins, are given in Table 3. The means for the two certainty classes of spots for a given probe are essentially the same, indicating t h a t the less visible spots did not give a skewed or biased distribution. As can be seen,

(a) and (b)Baseplates prepared by freeze-drying spontaneously transform to a star conformation. (e) to (f) By comparison, gpl2- stars negatively stained with 1~/o uranyl acetate and viewed in the CTEM typically appear in various states of transformation. The arrows in (a) and (b) indicate undecagold clusters, while those in (c) and (d) indicate anti-gp8 colloidal gold particles situated at the inner vertex of the stars, as discussed in the text. The micrographs in (a) and (b) were obtained with the Brookhaven Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope. The scale bar represents l0 nm. gp7 and gp8 retain approximately the same relative positions as in the hexagon, gp7 is located at a greater radius than gp8 and the proteins still appear to be in contact or at least close together. This is in agreement with the cross-linking data (Watts & Coombs, 1990), in which gp7-gp8 complexes are still observed in stars. The overlap between the two distributions reflects both the resolution of the 5 nm probe and the accuracy with which it is possible to assign a radial position for a given spot. As discussed above, the edge of the proteins is indistinct in the absence of negative stain. Because baseplates transform to stars lacking an unambiguous hand it was only possible to assign a radial position for a spot. 4. Discussion In our previous reports we determined the nearneighbour relationships between proteins in the T4 baseplate and related structures using chemical cross-linking (Watts & Coombs, 1989, 1990). Here, we use immunological probes to provide the spatial position of the first three gene products (gpT, gp8 and gpl0) involved in the assembly of the major precursor of the baseplate. An earlier analysis by Crowther et al. (1977) using image analysis of electron micrographs provided the location of proteins gp9, g p l l and gpl2. With the location of these additional three proteins, the baseplate mass accounted for is now approximately 58~/o. Table 3

Proteins gp7 and gpl0 form a complex that provides a binding site for gp8 both in vivo (Kikuchi & King, 1975a) and in vitro (Ptishker et al., 1988). The combinations of proteins gp7 and gp8 or gpl0 and gp8 do not result in complex formation in vitro, thereby defining the first strictly ordered assembly intermediate gpl0/gp7/gp8 (Plishker et al., 1988). Our cross-linking work demonstrated near-neighbour contact between all three of these proteins in the finished structure (Watts & Coombs, 1989, 1990). Any model of the baseplate should account for these findings and the notion that assembly of the major baseplate precursor proceeds topologically from the periphery towards the hub (Kikuchi & King, 1975a; Berget & King, 1978). The position of gp7 in the baseplate has not been determined before. The formation of a gp7-gpl0 complex as the first intermediate in wedge assembly requires gp7 to be located near gpl0 and, therefore, near the vertex in baseplates. The colloidal gold data and the antibody cross-linking results reported here both confirm this. The expectation that gp8 assembles inward of gp7 is supported by the immunogold results. The distance between the centres of the gp7 and gp8 clusters (Fig. 5(a)) agrees well with the calculated sizes of these two proteins (Gaffney & Craven, 1979), assuming that gp8 is either present in only one copy per wedge or that the gp8 dimer is oriented verti-

tally in the baseplate (see Fig. 5(c) and (d)). While the position of gp8 as indicated here does not correspond to a clearly identifiable concentration of mass in filtered images of baseplates (Crowther et al., 1977), it should be noted that the presence, accessibility and antigenicity of epitopes on a protein buried in the baseplate will affect the distribution of bound polyclonal probes and, therefore, the apparent location of the protein detected with this method. The wide variation of the anti-gp7 probes in the z direction measured on tails (Fig. 3 and Table 1) is a case in point. This is a very large (140,000Mr) protein whose exposure and antigenicity may be non-uniform. The position of gpl0 as shown here has been proposed previously (Crowther et al., 1977). It was observed (Berget & King, 1978) that pure g p l 0 - g p l l complexes formed asymmetric angular structures reminiscent of the pins and vertices of baseplates. However, these complexes had apparent stoichiometries of gpl02/gpll4 rather than the currently accepted gpl02/gpll2 (Berget & King, 1978, 1983). Unlike gp7, gpl0 is present in two copies per wedge, but the positions of the two gpl0 molecules relative to one another or to the other proteins are not known. The proximity of the gp7 and gpl0 clusters along the axis of the pin (Fig. 5(b)) suggests that the gpl0 dimer axis is oriented perpendicular to the axis of the pin as we have proposed (Watts & Coombs, 1990). However, at present, the colloidal gold data do not provide sufficient information to support this contention. It was hoped that the use of the finer undecagold probe would help determine the orientation of the gpl0 dimer, but the spontaneous transformation of all hexagons to the star form during the usual STEM specimen preparation for unstained samples has so far prevented us from determining the orientations of dimeric proteins such as gpl0. Baseplates and stars can be stabilized by low atomic number negative stains such as vanadate (our unpublished results). The use of these stains or other fixing procedures should make such high-resolution mapping possible. The stars observed in these freeze-dried undecagold-labelled preparations have dimensions similar to those of stars prepared from 9- and 12- mutants observed with negative stain, but measurements of the unstained particles are imprecise due .to their indistinct edge. None of the freeze-dried stars has a central hole, suggesting that they correspond to the incompletely transformed stars observed in the stained preparations (Fig. 6(e) and (d)). Thus, the transformation of the peripheral portions of baseplates appears to be only partially coupled to the opening event at the centre. The radial positions of gp7 and gp8 in stars increase by 2 nm and 3 nm, respectively, over those occupied by these proteins in hexagons (compare Tables 1 and 3). This in~cates that at least some of the increase in diameter from 45 nm in hexagons to 60 nm in stars may be due to expansion of the protein network within the plane of the hexagon. The remainder Of the increase

is probably due to the movement of the pins from a position perpendicular to the plane of the hexagon to one coplanar with the body of the baseplate. In support of this mechanism, stained stars decorated with the anti-gp8 colloidal gold frequently had gold particles bound in the inner vertex between two arms of the star (Fig. 6(c) and (d)), much as one might expect if the pins (Fig. 5(c)) pivoted up on their gp7 hinge to convert the hexagon to a star. In unstained preparations observed in the STEM there appeared to be only one class of star. Because these unstained images show protein in the radial position of gp7 determined with the undecagold probe (Table 3), there is good evidence that this protein forms the base of the arms in stars. The radial position of gp8 from the undecagold data is also compatible with the inner vertex location as suggested by the colloidal gold. If the pivoting of the pins forms the points of the star, then the centre of mass for gpl0 should shift to a much greater radius in the star configuration. We have observed, however, that gpl0 does not simply move to a position beside gp7 during the transformation. Rather, the anti-gpl0 affinity probe was bimodally distributed along the arm of the star such that some of the probe was located at the original radius while some was located towards the tip of the arm (not shown). Such a distribution suggests that gpl0, and possibly certain other proteins, may undergo a conformational transition during the hexagon-to-star transformation. Other electron microscopical evidence supporting this notion comes from the observation that isolated g p l 0 - g p l l complexes have an angular appearance (Berget & King, 1978). I f gpl0, which accounts for the majority of the mass of this complex, is indeed slightly " L " shaped rather than roughly spherical, this would suggest the presence of two domains on gpl0. Such a protein might be expected to bind the probe bimodally as described above. As for the role of the many dimers observed in the baseplate, Monod et al. (1965) in their consideration of allosteric transitions have pointed out that homotropic effects, i.e. interactions between identical subunits, are always co-operative. In other words, the inherent allosteric co-operativity of an isologous dimer or tetramer is a direct consequence of the symmetry of the subunits' association. One might expect, then, that such a dimer would act as an amplifier (Monod et al., 1965) and that such amplitiers could be catenated. In such a series, the subunits in the dimers could co-operatively stabilize one another thereby also stabilizing the whole structure. Following an allosteric transition in the first member of the chain, such as induced by an interaction with a specific ligand, conformational changes would then propagate through the assembly. The prevalence of isologous dimeric associations in the baseplate is noteworthy in this regard. Several principal components of the baseplate such as g p l l , gpl0, gp8 and gp6 form dimers when chemically cross-linked (Watts & Coombs, 1989, 1990). These components could be visualized

as serially arranged amplifiers which eventually act in parallel (as wedges) to activate the sheath. If dimers can act as amplifiers, then the gp9 tetramer may also be the baseplate trigger, gp9 is present in 24 copies per baseplate (Berget & King, 1983), indicating four copies per vertex, which suggests the presence of an isologous tetramer in a pseudotetrahedral arrangement. The potential for a concerted transition in the tetramer beyond a set conformational threshold is compatible with the proposal that gp9 transduces information from the long tail fibres to trigger the baseplate (Crowther, 1980; Urig et al., 1983). It was found that gp9 stabilizes the baseplate against transition to the star form under low ionic strength conditions as well as when the phage is in contact with the cell. gp9 may serve to transduce positional or other information from the long tail fibres to "cock" the baseptate, possibly by destabilizing it (Crowther, 1980). This may involve allowing the release of the gpl2 short tail fibres, with which the phage binds to the cell surface, from their docked position spanning the pins. The actual initiation of the transformation may then begin when gpl I contacts the cell surface, since particles deficient in gpl2, but containing g p l l , are triggered but do not attach irreversibly. Alternatively, the reorientation of the gpl2 fibres from the stored position towards the cell surface at this point could conceivably initiate the allosteric transition in the gpl 1 dimer. The release of the gpl2 short fibres from their stored position also serves to further destabilize the baseplate, since 12- baseplates readily transform to stars.
