INSL5 (insulin-like peptide 5) is a two-chain peptide hormone related to insulin and relaxin. It was recently discovered through searches of expressed sequence tag databases and, although the full biological significance of INSL5 is still being elucidated, high expression in peripheral tissues such as the colon, as well as in the brain and hypothalamus, suggests roles in gut contractility and neuroendocrine signalling. INSL5 activates the relaxin family peptide receptor 4 with high potency and appears to be the endogenous ligand for this receptor, on the basis of overlapping expression profiles and their apparent co-evolution. In the present study, we have used solution-state NMR to characterize the threedimensional structure of synthetic human INSL5. The structure reveals an insulin/relaxin-like fold with three helical segments that are braced by three disulfide bonds and enclose a hydrophobic core. Furthermore, we characterized in detail the hydrogen-bond network and electrostatic interactions between charged groups in

INSL5 by NMR-monitored temperature and pH titrations and undertook a comprehensive structural comparison with other members of the relaxin family, thus identifying the conserved structural features of the relaxin fold. The B-chain helix, which is the primary receptor-binding site of the relaxins, is longer in INSL5 than in its close relative relaxin-3. As this feature results in a different positioning of the receptor-activation domain ArgB23 and TrpB24 , it may be an important contributor to the difference in biological activity observed for these two peptides. Overall, the structural studies provide mechanistic insights into the receptor selectivity of this important family of hormones. Key words: insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5), NMR, peptide hormone, relaxin, relaxin family peptide receptor (RXFP), solutionstate structure.

INTRODUCTION

The relaxin family comprises seven peptides in humans, namely relaxins 1­3 [1­3] and the INSLs (insulin-like peptides) 3­6 [4­ 7]. Although the mammalian hormone `relaxin' (equivalent to relaxin-2 in humans) was identified 80 years ago and has long been known to be associated with pregnancy, both relaxin and its related hormones have, over recent years, been shown to be multifunctional peptides involved in numerous physiological processes. These processes include reproduction, neurosignalling, wound healing, collagen metabolism and cancer. Structurally, the relaxins are related to insulin. In their mature form, after a connecting C-peptide in the precursor protein has been removed, they comprise two peptide chains (A and B) that are connected by two disulfide bonds, with the A-chain having one additional intramolecular disulfide bond [8]. Together with insulin and the insulin-like growth factors I and II, the relaxins form the insulin/relaxin superfamily of signalling proteins (Figure 1). INSL5 was first identified through database searches of expressed sequence tags [6] and, although considerable efforts have been made to characterize its physiological role(s), its primary biological function remains unknown. Human INSL5 mRNA has been detected in various peripheral tissues, particularly in rectal and colon tissue [6]; however, INSL5 mRNA has also been located in the brain, primarily in the pituitary [9]. In mice, the highest level of expression is found in the colon and kidneys [6,10], but a recent study detected Insl5 mRNA in the hypothalamus.

The immunohistochemical detection of INSL5-immunoreactive neurons in the paraventricular, supraoptic, accessory secretory and supraoptic retrochiasmatic nuclei, as well as immunoreactive cell processes in the internal layer of the median eminence, together with its detection in the hypothalamus, suggests an additional neuroendocrine function for INSL5 in the mouse [11]. Intriguingly, the genes for both INSL5 and its receptor are dysfunctional in the dog and rat genomes [9], despite the aforementioned findings all indicating an important role for INSL5 in mammalian biology. An important step towards the characterization of INSL5 function in vivo was made recently when an optimized synthesis strategy was presented, which allows the production of sufficient quantities of INSL5 and analogues for further biological studies [12]. In contrast with insulin and the insulin-like growth factors I and II, which interact with tyrosine kinase receptors, the relaxin peptides signal through GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors). To date, four receptors have been identified and they are referred to as the RXFPs (relaxin family peptide receptors) 1­4. Interestingly, the relaxin-2 receptor, RXFP1 (LGR7, where LGR is leucine-richrepeat-containing GPCR) [13] and the INSL3 receptor, RXFP2 (LGR8) [14] are both characterized by a large N-terminal leucinerich-repeat-containing ligand-binding domain. In contrast, the relaxin-3 receptor, RXFP3 (GPCR135) [15] and the INSL5 receptor, RXFP4 (GPCR142) [9] are classic peptide ligand GPCRs. Considerable cross-reactivity between the ligands and the various receptors has been observed, with relaxin-2 being a

potent agonist of both RXFP1 and RXFP2 [13], whereas relaxin3, which is the ancestor of the relaxin family [16], has the unique feature of being able to activate relaxin receptors from both subgroups, namely RXFP1 [17], RXFP3 [15] and RXFP4 [18]. Despite relaxin-3 showing the same potency on the INSL5 receptor RXFP4 as INSL5 itself, INSL5 does not activate the relaxin-3 receptor RXFP3, although it is able to bind to RXFP3 with poor affinity and act as a weak RXFP3 antagonist [9]. Thus the process through which the relaxins activate their receptors is complex and relies on compatible structural features of both the ligands and the receptors. Over recent years, considerable progress has been made towards determination of the structure­activity relationships of relaxins; however, many aspects of the peptide­receptor interactions remain poorly understood. A clearer picture of the features guiding the interactions, and those which allow the activation of the receptors, is crucial for the design of selective agonists and antagonists that can be used both as pharmacological tools and as drug leads. The crystal structures of human relaxin-2 (H2 relaxin) [19] and the NMR solution structures of human relaxin-3 (H3 relaxin) [20], human INSL3 [21] and a relaxin chimaera peptide consisting of the A-chain from human INSL5 and the B-chain from H3 relaxin (R3/I5) [22] have revealed that, although the overall fold is well conserved, differences in amino acid sequence have crucial effects on the structure, particularly evident around the termini. Although evidence suggesting that both the A- and B-chains are involved in the receptor interaction is mounting, at least for the larger RXFP1 and RXFP2 [23,24], the primary binding interface of the relaxin family peptides has been mapped to an exposed surface on the B-chain helix [21,25,26]. In relaxin-3, the binding site for RXFP3 comprises residues ArgB8 , ArgB12 , IleB15 , ArgB16 and PheB20 , and, in addition, the C-terminal residues ArgB26 and TrpB27 are crucial for receptor activation [26]. Relaxin-3 also uses the same set of residues for activation of RXFP4, with the exception of ArgB12 , which is not required, and, given the high conservation of these residue in INSL5, it is likely that INSL5 binds to RXFP4 in a similar way [26].

In the present paper, we provide new mechanistic insights into the receptor selectivity of this family of peptides by presenting the solution structure of human INSL5, the last relaxin peptide for which the receptor has been identified. The structure has a conserved relaxin-like overall fold, but the B-chain -helix, which is part of the crucial receptor-binding and activation domains, is longer in INSL5 than in relaxin-3, and extends through to the C-terminal TrpB24 . Since both ArgB23 and TrpB24 are important for the activation of RXFP3 and RXFP4, the observed differences may play an important role in receptor selectivity. Furthermore, through NMR-monitored pH and temperature titrations, we provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogen-bond network and electrostatic interactions that are conserved throughout the relaxin structural framework. In addition to the new insights into the receptor interaction of INSL5, these findings will be important for guiding the design of relaxin analogues for further probing of the structure­activity relationships and in the development of potential drug leads.
EXPERIMENTAL NMR spectroscopy

The NMR sample for structure determination contained 1 mg of freeze-dried peptide diluted in 0.5 ml of 1 H2 O/2 H2 O (9:1, v/v) at pH  4. Two-dimensional 1 H data were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker Avance II spectrometer operating at 900 MHz and equipped with a cryogenic probe. All data, including TOCSY (with a MLEV17 mixing time of 60 ms), NOESY (with a mixing time of 100 and 150 ms) and DQF (double-quantum-filtered)COSY were recorded and processed using Topspin (Bruker). Generally, 4000 data points were collected in the F2 dimension, with 512 increments in the F1 dimension over a spectral width of 12 p.p.m., with the F1 zero-filled to 1000 data points and 90 phase-shifted sine bell window functions applied before transformation. Hydrogen-bond donors were identified from amide temperature coefficients (  HN / T): a series of TOCSY spectra were recorded at 600 MHz at 285, 295, 298, 305 and

310 K, and the chemical shifts of the amide protons were plotted as a function of temperature, with the  HN / T ratio being represented by the slope of the linear plot. The pK a values of all aspartate and glutamate residues were investigated by NMRmonitored pH titrations. A series of TOCSY spectra were recorded at 600 MHz at pH 2.0, 2.5, 2.7, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0, and the chemical-shift changes of all resonances were analysed. All protons that could be positively identified at all pH values and showed a difference in chemical shift of more than 0.1 p.p.m. throughout this interval, were fitted to sigmoidal curves using GraphPad Prism 5. The chemical shifts of all spectral data were calibrated to the resonance frequency of the solvent signal.
Structure calculations

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Peptide synthesis

All spectral analysis was done using the program package CARA [27]. Resonance assignments were achieved using sequential assignment strategies, and, once the chemical-shift assignments were confirmed, all NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) contacts were identified and converted into interproton distances using CYANA [28]. The backbone dihedral angle  was restrained to - 100 + 80 where a positive angle could be excluded based on an - NOE pattern of a strong sequential H i-1 -HNi in comparison with the intraresidual H i -HNi cross-peak. The side-chain  1 angles and the stereospecific H proton assignment were determined by combining information about HN-H and H-H NOE peak intensities in a 100 ms mixing time NOESY with H-H coupling constants from the DQF-COSY [29]. On the basis of this analysis the  1 angles were restrained to - 60 + 30 for - a t2 g3 conformation (AspA16 , CysA24 , CysB7 , GluB10 , CysB19 and B24  2 3 Trp ) and to - 180 + 30 for a predicted g t conformation - (MetA14 ). The  1 angle of AspA10 was restrained to - 120 + 90 - as a g2 g3 conformation could be ruled out on the basis of the B15 coupling constant pattern. For Val , the side-chain conformation and stereospecific assignment of the two methyl groups could be determined by analysis of the pattern of NOEs. Hydrogenbond restraints were included for amide protons having a  HN / T>- 4.6 p.p.m./K where suitable acceptors could be identified in the structure. Initial structure calculations were made using torsion angle dynamics in the program CYANA [28]. The final structure calculations were performed using simulated annealing and energy-minimization protocols within the program CNS 1.2 [30], using the parameter and topology files parallhdg5.3.pro and topallhdg5.3.pro [31]. A set of 50 structures was generated by a two-part simulated annealing protocol. The first part comprises 4000 steps of 0.015 ps torsion-angle dynamics, a cooling stage with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps during which the temperature is lowered from 50 000 to 0 K, and an energyminimization stage with 5000 steps of Powell minimization. The second part entails a refinement in explicit solvent and involves: (i) heating to 500 K via steps of 100 K, each comprising 50 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics; (ii) 3500 steps of Cartesian dynamics at 500 K; (iii) a cooling phase in which the temperature is lowered in steps of 100 K, each comprising 3500 steps of Cartesian dynamics; and (iv) an energy-minimization stage comprising 3000 steps of Powell minimization. From the 50 calculated, the 20 lowest-energy models were chosen to represent the INSL5 solution structure and analysed using PROCHECK [32]. Structures were generated using MOLMOL [33]. The Ramachandran analysis showed that 92.6 % of the residues are in the most-favoured region, with the remaining 7.4 % being found in the additionally allowed regions. The coordinates for the final set of structures, and the NMR restraints used to generate it, have been submitted to the PDB and given the accession code 2KBC.

The human INSL5 A- and B-chains were synthesized separately by continuous flow Fmoc (fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl) solidphase peptide synthesis. Both chains were unusually difficult to make via conventional synthesis protocols, but their successful assembly was achieved after the development of highly optimized conditions and through the use of a pseudoproline residue at a key position in the A-chain, as described in detail previously [12]. The two chains were subsequently combined by directed regioselective disulfide bond formation, and the final product was purified by RP (reverse-phase) HPLC and characterized by MALDI­TOF (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization­timeof-flight)-MS and NMR analysis, confirming its identity and purity.
NMR spectroscopy and resonance assignments

For the structure determination of human INSL5, twodimensional 1 H-NMR spectra were recorded at 900 MHz on a sample containing  0.2 mM peptide at pH 4. The spectra showed good signal dispersion, confirming that INSL5 is highly structured in solution, and allowed near-complete backbone and side-chain resonance assignments to be achieved through sequential assignment strategies [34]. As seen in previous studies of relaxins, significant line broadening was observed for a number of residues, including CysA7 , CysA8 , CysA12 , LeuA17 , SerA18 , CysA21 , ValB4 , ArgB5 , LeuB6 , GlyB8 , LeuB9 , IleB12 , IleB16 , CysB19 and AlaB20 . Particularly affected were the amide protons of CysA8 and CysA12 , which were broadened beyond detection under the conditions used in the present study. Although this broadening complicated the sequential assignment process, the identity of the observed spin systems was established through the detection of key long-range contacts and by chemicalshift comparison with other relaxins. The broadened resonances are centred around the CysA7 ­CysA12 intrachain disulfide bond, and are possibly the result of the disulfide bond switching between a pro-R and pro-S conformation, which is a feature that appears to be common throughout the relaxin family [21]. This disulfide bond is buried in the hydrophobic core and packs against the aromatic ring of TyrB11 . Thus small structural rearrangements can potentially affect many residues and lead to large chemical-shift differences between conformers from ring-current effects, resulting in severe broadening. In INSL5, the broadening extends further from this region than in related family members and includes the amide protons of CysA21 , IleB16 , CysB19 and AlaB20 , which suggests that there may be further dynamic processes involving the CysA21 ­CysB19 disulfide bond. INSL5 does not contain any proline residues, and hence minor conformations arising from cis/trans-isomerization of the imide bond are not a factor in this case. Such isomerization has been reported previously for relaxin-3 and INSL3 [20,21]. Secondary H chemical shifts (see the Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/419/bj4190619add.htm), which are good indicators of secondary structure, clearly indicate that INSL5 adopts three helical segments and two short extended regions, consistent with a relaxin structural fold.

with a mixing time of 100 ms. In addition to the intraresidual and sequential NOEs, which are expected from the covalent structure and form the basis of the sequential assignments, a large number of non-sequential contacts were identified. The majority of the medium-range NOEs define the fold of two helical segments in the A-chain and one helical segment in the Bchain, whereas most long-range contacts occur between the two A-chain helices, which lie antiparallel to each other, or between the A-chain helices and the B-chain helix, placing the B-chain helix across the face of the two A-chain helices. A summary of the complete distribution of non-sequential NOEs throughout the INSL5 sequence is available in Supplementary Figure S2 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/419/bj4190619add.htm. Hydrogen bonds were identified by amide temperature coefficient (  HN / T) analysis, i.e. by measuring the susceptibility of the amide proton chemical shifts to changes in temperature. Although the measurements were complicated by increased resonance broadening at lower temperatures,  HN / T values could be confidently determined for most residues. In general, amide protons that are involved in hydrogen bonds are protected from the solvent and are less affected by changes in temperature than free amides.  HN / T values of > - 4.6 p.p.m./K are indicative (> 85 %) of hydrogen bonds, with the probability increasing further to > 93 % if - 4.0 <  HN / T < - 1.0 p.p.b./K [35]. However, phenomena such as partial unfolding with increasing temperature can affect the  HN / T values, and structural restraints based on such information should be used with caution [36]. In the present study, we used preliminary structures to guide the analysis of the  HN / T data, and restraints for hydrogen bonds were only introduced if there was strong evidence from both the  HN / T and the structure calculations that a hydrogen bond was present. Strikingly, for all amides predicted to be hydrogen-bonded on the basis of the  HN / T data, a suitable acceptor was identified in the structure. The majority of the hydrogen bonds are located within the three helical regions, with only the ValB4 /CysA12 hydrogen-bond pair being present between the two chains. The complete backbone hydrogen-bond network is summarized in Supplementary Figure S2. Information about backbone and side-chain dihedral angles is important for refining structures by defining the local geometry of the peptide chain. Generally, dihedral angle restraints are derived from scalar coupling constants via the Karplus equation. Although in INSL5, the analysis was complicated by resonance broadening, which prevented accurate determination of many of the coupling constants in the DQF-COSY spectrum, a set of dihedral angle

restraints for  and  1 angles was derived from a combination of apparent coupling constants and intraresidual and sequential NOE patterns. The experimental data were used to generate a family of 20 structures to represent the solution structure of INSL5. An overlay of these structures is shown in Figure 2, from which it is clear that the structure is well defined over most regions, with only the B-chain N-terminus, which is probably flexible in solution, being poorly defined. The structure is in excellent agreement with the experimental data and has good covalent geometry, as is evident from Table 1, which summarizes the experimental and structural statistics.

Description of the three-dimensional structure and comparison with other relaxins

Overall, the INSL5 structure reveals an insulin/relaxin fold with three helical segments that enclose a hydrophobic core in an arrangement that is held together by the three disulfide bonds. The A-chain is characterized by two -helices comprising residues A2­A9 and A14­A22, which are separated by an extended region (residues A10­A13). The last part of the C-terminal helix (LeuA21 and CysA22 ) adopts 310 helix characteristic hydrogen bonds, and a similar pattern cannot be ruled out for the residues CysA7 , CysA8 and ThrA9 , as this region of the N-terminal helix is less defined owing to the broadening and lack of restraints in this region. The B-chain is disordered at the N-terminus, which is followed by an extended region comprising residues B4­B7 and thereafter a longer helical segment comprising residues B8­B24. The two extended regions in the A- and B-chains adopt a short sheet stabilized by a pair of hydrogen bonds between CysA12 and ValB4 . The hydrophobic core of INSL5, which is enclosed by the elements of secondary structure, comprises primarily the residues LeuA3 , CysA7 , CysA12 , LeuA17 , LeuA20 , LeuB6 , TyrB11 and ValB15 , with residues GlnA4 , CysA21 , IleB12 , IleB16 and CysB19 providing additional hydrophobic interactions on the fringe of the core. This hydrophobic core is highly conserved between relaxins, but the types of hydrophobic residue at these key positions can change, slightly altering the packing of the core and resulting in minor differences in the orientations of the helices. The conservation of the overall structural features is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows a comparison of the INSL5 structure with the NMR structure of H3 relaxin and the crystal structure of H2 relaxin. Figure 3 also illustrates the similar positioning of the residues

No such NOEs are seen for INSL5.

found to be important for binding to RXFP3 and RXFP4, which are all exposed on the B-chain helix in INSL5 and H3 relaxin. Although their general structural features are similar, there are a number of interesting differences between INSL5 and H3 relaxin, including the conformation of the A-chain N-terminus and the B-chain termini. The A-chain N-terminus is three residues shorter in INSL5 than in H3 relaxin, H2 relaxin and INSL3 and as a result the helix in this region is also shorter. Recently, it has been shown that this region of the hormones is not needed for receptor activity [23], and, as is evident from the structure of INSL5 presented here, it is not required for overall structural integrity either. The INSL5 B-chain N-terminus is also three residues shorter than in H3 relaxin and, although poorly defined, it folds around the extended region to form electrostatic interactions with the A-chain. In contrast, in H3 relaxin, the tail interacts more with other parts of the B-chain, and, in particular, a number of hydrophobic interactions are seen between ProB4 and PheB20 , and between TyrB5 and LysA17 . Even more significant are the differences around the B-chain C-terminus, which in INSL5 adopts a helix that extends towards the C-terminal TrpB24 residue. Interestingly, this is similar to what

To investigate further the structural differences between INSL5 and H3 relaxin and to generate a detailed picture of the hydrogen-bond network within the relaxin structural framework, we recorded temperature coefficients also for H3 relaxin and a comparison between the two peptides is presented in Figure 4. The pattern of hydrogen bonds in the A-chain C-terminal helix is identical in both peptides, and also consistent with the crystal structure of H2 relaxin. The amide protons of SerA13 (SerA16 in H3 relaxin) and AspA16 (GluA19 ) at the N-terminal part of the helix are hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain carboxy group of AspA13 (GluA16 ). Residues A14/A17 and A15/A18 are not hydrogen-bonded in the majority of the structures in the INSL5 and H3 relaxin ensembles, but, in some models, also interact with this carboxy group. CysA12 (CysA15 ) hydrogenbonds to the B-chain in the short -sheet region. The hydrogenbond pattern in the N-terminal A-chain helix is less defined in INSL5 and may differ slightly between the peptides, although this is difficult to confirm, as both the  HN / T values and the structural details may be affected by the flexibility and broadening in this region. In the crystal structure of H2 relaxin, an -helical hydrogen-bonding pattern is seen for residues corresponding to A1­A10 in INSL5, but this helix has been shown to be more flexible in H3 relaxin [20]. The B-chain N-terminal region is characterized by a lack of hydrogen bonds, consistent with it being disordered. ValB4 (ValB7 ) forms an interchain hydrogen bond to CysA12 (CysA15 ), and, from GluB10 (GluB13 ) onwards, a stretch of -helical hydrogen bonds is seen. However, the  HN / T values indicate two striking differences. First, LeuB9 in H3 relaxin appears to be hydrogen-bonded and indeed is involved in an interchain hydrogen bond in the structure. The equivalent residue, LeuB6 , is not hydrogen-bonded in INSL5. Secondly, the C-terminal residues in INSL5 all show  HN / T values consistent with hydrogen-bonding, which is not the case in H3 relaxin. This finding confirms that the helical region extends further in INSL5 than in H3 relaxin. An interesting observation was, however, made for these five last residues. The data point at the highest temperature, 310 K, did not fit with the otherwise linear chemical shift­temperature relationship. This is likely to be the result of the helix being rather labile and starting to unfold at higher temperatures, leading to changes in shifts towards random coil values. As these amide protons are upfield-shifted, the opposing shift changes owing to unfolding compared with the usual hydrogenbonding temperature-dependence would cancel each other out in this case, which would fit with the observations seen here. Thus, for the values reported in Figure 4, data points at 310 K were not included in the analysis of residues B20­B24 of INSL5.
Characterization of electrostatic interactions in INSL5 by pH titrations

Salt bridges and electrostatic interactions can be confirmed by determination of the pK a values of ionizable groups, which in turn can be derived from titration curves of chemical shifts as a function of pH. To analyse the structural roles of the five acidic residues in INSL5, AspA2 , AspA10 , AspA16 , GluB2 and GluB10 , we studied

The native peptide comprises additional acidic groups expected to titrate within this range at the two C-termini, but the synthetic peptide studied, which is fully active, was prepared with amidated C-termini. Although most resonances were relatively unaffected by the changes in pH, apart from a general broadening of the amide protons with increasing pH as a result of increased solvent exchange, a number of resonances were significantly shifted. The titration curves for the resonances showing a chemical shift that changed by more than 0.1 p.p.m. over the range studied are presented in Figure 5(A). The expected pK a values for unperturbed aspartate and glutamate residues are 3.8­ 4.0 and 4.3­ 4.5 respectively [37]. However, the observed pK a values of AspA2 , AspA10 , AspA16 , GluB2 and GluB10 in INSL5 were 2.7, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 respectively, indicating that interactions favour the negatively charged form and shift the equilibrium by > 1 pH unit.

N-terminal helix cap, and forms a network of hydrogen bonds to the amide protons of GlnA4 and ThrA5 , as well as the side-chain amide proton of GlnA4 and the side-chain hydroxy group proton of ThrA5 (Figure 5B). AspA10 is in close proximity to LysB1 , which, in addition to its positively charged side chain, also carries the positively charged N-terminal amine group (Figure 5B). AspA16 is also close to LysB1 , but also forms an N-terminal helix cap on the second A-chain helix and hydrogen-bonds to both the amide proton and the side-chain hydroxy group proton of SerA13 , and its own amide proton (Figure 5C). The GluB2 side chain interacts with ArgB5 in some structures, as seen in Figure 5(B). In another set of structures, the side-chain hydrogen-bonds to the hydroxy group side chains of SerA13 and ThrA15 . It is not possible to rule out either of the conformations on the basis of our experimental data. In addition to a possible interaction with GluB2 , ArgB5 also interacts with the negative part of the N-terminal A-chain helix dipole. Finally, GluB10 is situated at the N-terminus of the longer

B-chain helix, interacting with the helix dipole and the positive charge of ArgB13 (Figure 5D), although the latter interaction is unlikely to be important for the functional form of INSL5, as ArgB13 is crucial for receptor binding. The chemical shift of the amide proton of ValB4 has significant pH-dependence. Interestingly, this amide forms an interchain hydrogen bond with CysA12 , and thus the change in chemical shift reflects a change in this interaction. Strongly hydrogen-bonded amides are deshielded, and, as the chemical shift of ValB4 moves downfield with increasing pH, this supports a strengthening of the hydrogen bond, and thus a tighter association between the chains at high pH. Furthermore, the H protons of AspA13 , GluB5 , GlyA11 , ValB4 and LeuB6 all move downfield with increasing pH, confirming that the -sheet interaction between the two chains in this region is strengthened. The small difference in pK a values between the carboxy groups makes it difficult to pinpoint the electrostatic interactions that are responsible for this stabilizing effect, but the ones involving LysB1 and GluB2 both tie the B-chain N-terminal region closer to the molecular core. In the light of the finding that all acidic residues in human INSL5 form interactions in the three-dimensional fold, it is

interesting to note that AspA2 , AspA16 and GluB10 at the N-terminus of each of the three helical segments are highly conserved throughout INSL5 sequences from different species and in H3 relaxin. However, in other peptides throughout the family, these residues are not as well conserved, indicating that they are not an absolute requirement for a stable relaxin fold.
INSL5 interactions with RXFP3 and RXFP4

The observation that INSL5, like H3 relaxin and INSL3, appears to have a flexible fold, is interesting, given that a significant degree of flexibility has previously been suggested to be crucial for the biological activity of insulin. The insulin analogues desPheB25 insulin and PT insulin both have increased activity at the insulin receptor, despite having destabilized folds with increased flexibility [38,39]. It is possible that, for INSL5 and the other relaxins, a flexible fold is required for adopting an optimal conformation for interacting with their receptors. Structure­ activity studies on H3 relaxin have established that it interacts with both RXFP3 and the RXFP4 in a similar fashion, using a series of residues exposed on the surface of the B-chain. Specifically,

ArgB8 , IleB15 , ArgB16 and PheB20 are important for binding to both receptors, and, in addition, ArgB12 is important for binding to RXFP3 [26]. On the basis of the close relationship between H3 relaxin and INSL5, as well as between their receptors, RXFP3 and RXFP4, it would seem likely that INSL5 interacts with RXFP4 in a similar way. This is supported further by the high conservation of the residues identified as receptor contacts in H3 relaxin, with the only difference between the peptides being a conservative PheB20 to TyrB17 substitution (Figure 1). In contrast, at the position equivalent to ArgB12 in H3 relaxin, which was found to be important only for binding to RXFP3, INSL5 hosts LeuB9 , and it is possible that this non-conservative change accounts for much of the decrease in affinity of INSL5 for this receptor. More intriguing is the difference between the two peptides in terms of potency on the RXFPs. For H3 relaxin, the activation domain for both RXFP3 and RXFP4 is located at the B-chain C-terminal residues ArgB26 and TrpB27 . However, despite both of these residues being fully conserved in INSL5, INSL5 acts as an RXFP4 agonist, but an RXFP3 antagonist. We have shown in the present study that there are important structural differences between H3 relaxin and INSL5 in this region. The INSL5 B-chain helix extends to the C-terminal TrpB24 , whereas in H3 relaxin, the helical segments end with CysB22 , five residues earlier (Figure 5). In H3 relaxin, rather than extending away from the core the C-terminal tail folds back on to the molecule and the aromatic side chain of TrpB27 forms a large number of contacts with residues ValB18 , IleB19 and the CysA24 ­CysB22 disulfide bond, which are evident from NOEs [20]. A similar arrangement of the tail is seen in the solution structures of both the R3/I5 chimaera and INSL3 [21,22]. Despite the tryptophan residue in these molecules clearly preferring to interact with the peptide core, the tail appears to be generally quite flexible, with limited backbone NOEs and small deviations from random coil shifts, and it is likely that, once bound to the receptor, it can adopt a different conformation if needed for activity. Thus, if RXFP3 and RXFP4 require different positioning of the C-terminal tail for activation, this may explain why H3 relaxin can activate both receptors. In contrast, in INSL5 the preferred positioning of ArgB21 and TrpB22 is clearly defined by the helical conformation and is further away from the molecular core. This conformation may not be suitable for the interaction needed for activation of RXFP3, thereby giving INSL5 its antagonistic activity. The reason for the structural differences between INSL5 and H3 relaxin is likely to be the presence of the residues GlyB23 -GlyB24 immediately after CysB22 , which would be expected to be strongly destabilizing for a helical conformation. In contrast, INSL5 has the considerably more favourable AlaB20 SerB21 pair in the equivalent position, which could support an extension of the helix.
Conclusions

These differences are particularly interesting considering that the C-terminal Arg-Trp motif is crucial for H3 relaxin's activation of both RXFP3 and RXFP4. Future mutational studies should be directed at this region to explore the role of this Arg-Trp motif and the helical conformation in the pharmacological profile of INSL5.

In the present study, we have solved the solution NMR structure of the human peptide hormone INSL5 and characterized the hydrogen-bond and electrostatic interactions that stabilize the relaxin structural framework. The structure is tightly folded and characterized by three helical segments that enclose a hydrophobic core. Despite the stabilizing hydrophobic interactions in the core, the extensive hydrogen-bond network, favourable electrostatic interactions involving charged side-chain groups and the covalent cross-bracing of the disulfide array, the structure is rather flexible, as is evident from significant line broadening of many resonances. This flexibility appears to be a common characteristic of the relaxin family, and may well be important for function. The main structural differences between INSL5 and H3 relaxin occur around the B-chain termini, which adopt a helical conformation in INSL5.
