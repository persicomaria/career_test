ABSTRACT The crystal structures of two CLIC family members DmCLIC and EXC-4 from the invertebrates Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively, have been determined. The proteins adopt a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fold. The structures are highly homologous to each other and more closely related to the known structures of the human CLIC1 and CLIC4 than to GSTs. The invertebrate CLICs show several unique features including an elongated C-terminal extension and a divalent metal binding site. The latter appears to alter the ancestral glutathione binding site, and thus, the invertebrate CLICs are unlikely to bind glutathione in the same manner as the GST proteins. Purified recombinant DmCLIC and EXC-4 both bind to lipid bilayers and can form ion channels in artificial lipid bilayers, albeit at low pH. EXC-4 differs from other CLIC proteins in that the conserved redox-active cysteine at the N-terminus of helix 1 is replaced by an aspartic acid residue. Other key distinguishing features of EXC-4 include the fact that it binds to artificial bilayers at neutral pH and this binding is not sensitive to oxidation. These differences with other CLIC family members are likely to be due to the substitution of the conserved cysteine by aspartic acid.

INTRODUCTION The CLICs are a family of proteins with six human paralogues (CLIC1­6), each of which is conserved in most vertebrate species. The founding family member, p64, was first identified on the basis of its association with chloride ion channel activity and purified from bovine kidney extracts through its affinity to the chloride channel blocker IAA-94.1­3 Each CLIC protein contains a conserved $230 amino acid C-terminal module (referred to as the ``CLIC module'') whose structure belongs to the glutathione Stransferase (GST) fold family.4,5 The functional role(s) of the CLIC proteins is still poorly understood. As they were first isolated based on their copurification with an ion channel activity and affinity toward the ion channel blocker IAA-94, one hypothesis is that they may act as, or regulate, chloride channels within intracellular membranes.3,6­8 Several research groups have demonstrated that CLIC proteins display chloride ion channel activity and in particular, purified recombinant human CLIC1 and CLIC4, expressed in Escherichia coli, produce anion channels in artificial bilayers, in the absence of other proteins.9­13

Crystal Structures of Invertebrate CLIC Proteins

What remains unclear is whether this ion channel activity plays a central role in the biological function of the CLIC proteins. In addition to their association with membranes, a substantial fraction of CLICs is present within the cytosol in a soluble form. Thus, it is possible that CLICs could also have additional functions, which are not directly associated with membranes. One factor hampering the analysis of CLIC protein function is that most, if not all, vertebrate cells endogenously express multiple family members.8,14­16 Possible functional redundancies between the various family members can confuse the interpretation of results in studies in which only a single CLIC family member is inactivated or perturbed. This may be resolved by the recent discoveries of CLIC homologues in several model organisms, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Berryman and Tanda. Drosophila Research Conference 2005;46:245B) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.17 These organisms possess only one (D. melanogaster) or two (C. elegans) CLIC family members, which makes them attractive subjects for functional analysis, assuming the core function and mode of action of CLICs are conserved among distantly related species. The D. melanogaster genome contains a single CLIClike gene encoding a 260 amino acid protein referred to here as DmCLIC. C. elegans contains two CLIC-like proteins, EXC-4 (290 amino acids), and EXL-1 (238 amino acids).17 DmCLIC and EXC-4 share 37% sequence identity, while they each share 20­25% identity with human CLIC modules. EXL-1 is more distantly related, sharing 24% sequence identity with EXC-4 and $20% identity with DmCLIC or human CLIC modules. The two nematode CLIC homologues are among the most extensively characterized proteins from within the CLIC family with regard to function. The loss of the exc4 gene (exc-4 null mutant) results in a distinct phenotype in which enlarged cysts form within the intracellular excretory canal of C. elegans.17 In the wild-type nematode, EXC-4 is localized to the luminal membrane of this excretory canal as well as a variety of other tubular membranes.17,18 The exc-4 null mutant phenotype could be rescued by introduction of the wild-type protein into nematodes lacking a functional exc-4 gene. In such experiments, EXC-4 was seen to be essential for both the development and the maintenance of the excretory canal. EXL-1 (EXC-4-like protein 1) also localizes to intracellular membranes in the nematode, albeit membranes largely distinct from those associated with EXC-4.18 In particular, EXL-1 constructs were seen to localize to lysosomal membranes in the intestine and to the Golgi apparatus in neurons and muscle.17 From both sequence and function in C. elegans, EXL-1 is clearly related to EXC-4, however, EXL-1 appears to be restricted to nematode species. Recent experiments show that both EXL-1 and DmCLIC can rescue the exc-4 null mutant phenotype when expressed in C. elegans, while human CLIC1 and

CLIC4 fail to do so.18 Thus, the invertebrate and vertebrate CLICs have distinct functional properties when expressed in C. elegans. The N-terminal 66 residues in EXC-4 contain the putative transmembrane (PTM) region that has been postulated to facilitate the formation of the ion channel in mammalian CLICs. The EXC-4 PTM was shown to be sufficient for membrane localization in C. elegans but, alone, could not rescue the exc-4 null mutant phenotype.17 Chimeras containing the EXC-4 PTM fused to the remaining three quarters of either human CLIC1, C. elegans omega GST or the C. elegans sigma GST all rescued the exc-4 null mutant phenotype, while the parent molecules failed to do so.18 Thus, in the context of a GST fold protein, the EXC-4 PTM appears to be necessary and sufficient for biological function in C. elegans.18 To date, the only reported CLIC protein structures have been for human CLIC1 in the soluble monomeric4,19 and the oxidized dimeric20 states, and the soluble form of human CLIC4.12,21 The soluble monomeric forms of CLIC1 and CLIC4 belong to the GSTfold family, albeit with features that appear unique to vertebrate CLICs. On oxidation, CLIC1 undergoes a dramatic structural change, which results in an all helical dimeric structure, where each CLIC1 monomer contains an intramolecular disulphide bond. We have postulated that this altered structure resembles a membrane-docking form.20 In this article, the crystal structures of the soluble forms of DmCLIC and EXC-4 are presented. The structures are most closely related to the soluble forms of human CLIC1 and CLIC4. In addition, both invertebrate CLICs can bind to artificial lipid bilayers and can form ion channels in vitro in a manner similar to human CLIC1. Hence, the two invertebrate CLIC proteins are clearly part of the same protein family. The two invertebrate CLICs share several features that distinguish them from the structures of human CLIC1 and CLIC4, including a bound divalent metal ion and an elongated C-terminal extension. The structural and biophysical findings are discussed in light of the in vivo functional characterization of EXC-4 which has been described recently.18 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning

The plasmid pDmCLIC was constructed by cloning the cDNA for the D. melanogaster gene CG10997 (NM_ 132700) into the pGEX-2T GST-fusion vector (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). A plasmid pEXC-4 was also constructed by cloning the cDNA for the C. elegans gene exc-4 (AY308063) into the pGEX-4T-1 GST-fusion vector (Amersham Biosciences). Both vectors were transformed into E. coli (DE3) competent cells (Stratagene) for expression.

Protein expression and purification

The GST-fusion products of the vectors pDmCLIC and pEXC-4 were expressed and purified using essentially the same protocol as that previously reported for CLIC1.4 Both proteins eluted from the final column, a gel filtration Superdex 75 prep grade HiLoad 26/60 (Amersham Biosciences), as a monomer in the presence of 1 mM DTT. Subsequently DmCLIC was concentrated to 25 mg/ mL, and EXC-4 to 7 mg/mL, before aliquoting, flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and storing at 2808C. No detergent was used at any stage of the protein preparation and purification.

cryosystems). Diffraction data were thus obtained at 100 K on both a Mar345 image plate mounted on a Nonius rotating anode generator using Cu Ka radiation and Osmic confocal mirror optics and beamline 9.2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory at a wave° length of 0.98 A. The DmCLIC crystals diffracted to 1.70 ° A in the space group P212121 with cell dimensions a 5 ° ° ° 39.40 A, b 5 63.42 A, and c 5 114.07 A at the synchrotron. The P21 crystal form of EXC-4 also diffracted on a ° rotating anode generator to 1.60 A with unit cell dimen° ° ° sions a 5 54.73 A, b 5 91.69 A, c 5 63.65 A, and b 5 ° 99.058, however, the data beyond 1.90 A was only 75% complete because of spot overlaps caused by an unfavorable crystal orientation on the spindle.
Structure determination and refinement

DmCLIC was crystallized at 48C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method over a 500-lL reservoir consisting of either: 20% w/v monodisperse polyethylene glycol 3350 (Hampton research) and 0.2M KI; or 17% w/v monodisperse polyethylene glycol 3350 (Hampton research), 0.14M KI and 100 mM EDTA. Drops consisted of 3 lL of protein at 12.7 mg/mL and 3 lL of reservoir. Crystals grew over a 2-day period, reaching a final size of $400 lm 3 200 lm 3 200 lm. If not harvested immediately, crystals deteriorated rapidly over the next 3­4 days. EXC-4 was initially crystallized at 208C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method over a 500-lL reservoir consisting of 16% monodisperse polyethylene glycol 3350 (Hampton research) and 0.15M HCOONa. Drops consisted of 3 lL protein at 4.8 mg/mL and 3 lL of reservoir. After 2 days, two morphologically distinct crystal forms were observed under these conditions. The predominant crystal form grew as hexagonal prisms and displayed highly anisotropic diffraction in the space group P32, typically these crystals had unit cells with a 5 b 5 ° ° 50­55 A and c 5 160 A. Occasionally, small rectangular block-like crystals were observed in some wells and such crystals displayed more isotropic diffraction in the space group P21. Using a glass fiber, the P21 crystal form was streak seeded into drops grown over a reservoir consisting of 14% w/v monodisperse polyethylene glycol 3350 (Hampton research) and 0.15M HCOONa. Crystals grew more frequently in those drops that were seeded and a higher proportion of crystals from seeded wells were in the P21 space group suitable for diffraction studies.
Data collection and processing

The DmCLIC crystals were progressively transferred into a cryoprotectant consisting of the reservoir solution plus 250 mg/mL D-glucose. The EXC-4 P21 crystal form was equilibrated for 10­20 min over 500 lL of the initial reservoir plus 30% v/v isopropanol. Both the DmCLIC and EXC-4 crystals were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and mounted at 100 K in a nitrogen cryostream (Oxford

For DmCLIC, the CLIC1 reduced monomer structure (pdb code 1K0M4) without the flexible foot loop (residues 6-146 and 166-241) was used as a molecular replacement probe using the CCP422 program AMoRE.23 An initial model was built using the program wARP24 with further rounds of manual model building performed in the program O.25 This was refined using maximum likelihood methods (using the program Refmac 526). The final DmCLIC model was obtained from a crystal grown in 100 mM EDTA and it consists of a single DmCLIC molecule within the asymmetric unit and contains residues 14-72, 78-238, and 244-258 plus 95 water molecules, one iodide ion and one calcium ion. Pro-85 adopts a cis peptide bond. The final R-factor is 0.218 with R-free at 0.254. The data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The DmCLIC coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2YV7). For EXC-4, the DmCLIC structure was used as a molecular replacement probe using CCP422 program AMoRE.23 An initial model was built using the program wARP24 with further rounds of manual model building then performed in the program O25. This was refined using maximum likelihood methods (using the program Refmac 526). An additional refinement was carried out ° using all available (albeit incomplete) data to 1.6 A (61,174 unique reflections, I/r 16.8, completeness 75.8%, multiplicity 3.6, Rmerge 0.04). The inclusion of this additional data made a marked improvement in the electron maps and facilitated the resolution of helix N at the Nterminus of the A subunit. The EXC-4 P21 crystal form contains two molecules within the asymmetric unit (Ca ° RMS deviation of 0.41 A calculated using the program 25). The final EXC-4 model consists of residues 1-284 O in the A subunit (plus an additional N-terminal residue coming from the thrombin cleavage site), and residues 15-141 and 147-285 in the B subunit, plus 348 water molecules, and two calcium ions. The break in electron density in the B subunit occurs in a nematode-specific

This loop region, which is called the ``a4­a5 loop'', also displays higher than average temperature factors in the A subunit, possibly indicating a certain degree of flexibility of this region in solution.

EXC-4 also crystallized as a dimer in this crystal form, where the dimer is indistinguishable from that seen in the high resolution crystal form.
Membrane binding via surface plasmon resonance

Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out with a Biacore 2000 analytical system using the L1 sensor chip. Methods are essentially as previously described12 and were largely based on the protocol of Subasinghe et al.28 Briefly, the chip surface was first cleaned with an injection of CHAPS (40 lM) followed by an injection of running buffer (10-mM phosphate, 10mM MES, 150-mM NaCl, pH values 5.0­7.0, depending on the experiment) to ensure all detergent was removed from the system. Small unilamellar liposomes of phos-

phatidylcholine (1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; Avanti Polar Lipids No.850356), prepared by lipid extrusion were then injected to generate a bilayer on the chip surface. The surface was then briefly exposed to sodium hydroxide (10 mM) to remove any multilamellar structures. Any remaining exposed surfaces of the L1 chip were blocked with BSA (1 mg/mL in running buffer) during the first phase of a coinjection. BSA Æ CLIC protein (EXC-4, dmCLIC or CLIC1) (62­400 lg/ mL) was then introduced in the second phase of the coinjection. This strategy minimizes any possibility of nonspecific binding of CLIC. After the coinjection, the chip surface was stripped of all protein with an injection of 50:50 mixture of 100 mM HCl and isopropanol. For oxidation experiments, DTT was removed from the protein sample using a PD-10 desalting column. The protein concentration was measured by recording the absorbance at 280 nm. A 40 molar excess of H2O2 was added and incubated for 60 min at room temperature before coinjection with BSA as described earlier.
Electrophysiology

Single-channel recordings from lipid bilayers were obtained using the tip­dip method, as previously described.9 In brief, patch clamp pipettes (Garner Glass 7052) were made using a P97 Sutter Instruments puller (Novato, CA), coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) and fire-polished to a tip diameter of 1­1.5

lm and 5­7 megaohm resistance. The same solution was used both in the bath and in the pipette (140-mM KCl, 10-mM Hepes, pH 6). In some experiments, the bath solution (trans) was acidified to pH 5 and 4 by the addition of HCl. In all experiments, as soon as the pipette tip reached the bath solution, a phospholipid monolayer (1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine No. 850356, Avanti Polar Lipids) was spread on the surface. This is the same phosphatidylcholine as per the surface plasmon resonance experiments. The electrode was repeatedly passed through the surface of the solution until the pipette resistance rose above 5 gigaohms. Purified recombinant DmCLIC or EXC-4 (2 lg/mL) was then added to the bath. An Axopatch 1D amplifier and pClamp 8 (both from Axon Instruments, Novato, CA) were used to record and analyze single-channel currents. Current recordings were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 800 Hz. Data are presented as mean Æ SEM. Values obtained from different experiments were tested for statistical differences using independent two population t test (Origin software, Origin Lab, Northampton, MA).

The atomic coordinates and structure factors (codes 2YV9 and 2YV7, EXC-4 and DmCLIC, respectively) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (http://www.rcsb.org/). The structures of the two proteins ° are very similar to each other (RMS deviation of 1.4 A over 225 Ca atoms), each adopting a GST fold. They are structurally close to the mammalian CLIC proteins [Figs. ° 1(C,D)] with RMS deviations of 1.4 A (202 Ca atoms) ° and 1.65 A (193 Ca atoms) between human CLIC1 and DmCLIC and EXC-4, respectively. As per the mammalian CLICs, under reducing conditions, DmCLIC is monomeric in both solution (size exclusion chromatography, data not shown) and in the crystal. While EXC-4 is also monomeric in solution (size exclusion chromatography, data not shown), the protein appears to be dimeric in the two crystal forms examined. The dimer in the crystals is reminiscent of GST dimers [Fig. 1(E)]. The dimer differs from the majority of GST dimers (but not the b-class GSTs31) in that the interactions between the two monomers are mainly polar.
Comparison of the invertebrate and vertebrate CLIC structures

Chloride efflux assay of EXC-4 and DmCLIC channel activity was performed essentially as described previously.20 Briefly, 400 nm unilamellar liposomes (soybean phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol, 9:1, w/w; Sigma P-5638 and C-8662, respectively) were prepared by extrusion (Avestin Lipofast extruder) in 5-mM sodium phosphate buffer, 200-mM KCl pH 6.0. The extravesicular chloride was removed by desalting on a Bio-Gel P6DG spin column (Bio-Rad Laboratories) equilibrated in 330-mM sucrose, 5-mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0. EXC-4 and DmCLIC were also equilibrated into the same buffer at pH 6.0. For each efflux experiment over the pH range of 5.0 through 9.0, EXC-4 or DmCLIC was added to a final concentration of 23 lg/mL or 27 lg/mL, respectively, to the liposomes in a total volume of 4 mL of 330 mM sucrose, 5-mM sodium phosphate at the required pH. A chloride selective electrode (Radiometer Pacific) was used to monitor the potential driven chloride efflux from the vesicles upon the addition of 1.4 lM valinomycin. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% after 240 s to normalize the chloride release from vesicles.

RESULTS
Crystal structures of the invertebrate CLIC proteins: DmCLIC and EXC-4

The crystal structures of DmCLIC [Fig.1(A)] and EXC° 4 [Fig. 1 (B)] were determined at 1.70 and 1.90 A resolution, respectively (see Table I for data reduction and

The major structural elements in the vertebrate CLIC structures (human CLIC1 and CLIC4) are preserved in the invertebrate CLICs (Figs. 1 and 2). The main difference between all the CLIC structures is the position of helix 2 on the front of the b-sheet, which varies among all family members 12 (Fig. 1). The length of secondary structural elements is identical with only a few exceptions. There is a 4-residue insertion at the C-terminus of helix 1 in DmCLIC and EXC-4 (compared with human CLICs), which may be significant as this is in the PTM region which functionally distinguishes the invertebrate CLICs from the mammalian CLICs in the C. elegans in vivo assay.18 Differences between the two invertebrate CLIC proteins include: in EXC-4, helix 3 is extended by four residues from its C-terminus and is rotated by $158 with respect to the remainder of the molecule. Unlike the structures of the other CLIC family members, EXC-4's helix 4 is not broken into two separate halves. This is noteworthy since the sequence in this region (Ile­Glu­Asn­Leu) is essentially identical to that of DmCLIC, where helix 4 is broken into two halves (Fig. 2). Helix 4 of EXC-4 also extends an extra two turns from its C-terminus leading into the nematode specific a4­a5 loop. In DmCLIC, helix 5 is $5 residues shorter at the N-terminus than the same helix in the human CLIC structures. In EXC-4 this is not the case; however, there is a sharp bend leading into helix 5 from the a4­a5 loop occurring at approximately the same position. Although elements of secondary structure remain relatively unchanged between the vertebrate CLICs and the

invertebrate CLIC proteins, several loop regions adopt different conformations in DmCLIC and EXC-4. These include the extension of the loop leading into b-strand 2 because of the insertion at the C-terminus of helix 1. The interdomain-loop (between helices 3 and 4) in DmCLIC and EXC-4 is also distinct from the prolinerich interdomain loops of the human CLICs; DmCLIC contains a shorter connecting loop with a single a-helical turn. The loop between helix 4 and helix 5 is also shorter in DmCLIC than in the human CLICs while this loop plus the C-terminus of helix 4 is longer in EXC-4 and coincides with a sequence insertion that appears to be unique to nematode CLICs. Finally, the flexible ``foot

loop'' between helix 5 and helix 6 present in all human CLIC family members4,12 is absent in the two invertebrate CLIC proteins. Instead, DmCLIC and EXC-4 each possess an abridged GST loop in this region.

C-terminal extension

A novel feature seen in both invertebrate CLIC structures is an extended C-terminal segment which packs against the body of the molecule, interacting with residues from within helices 6, 7, and 9. These extensions predominantly form an elongated extended chain struc-

A conserved tyrosine residue is present at or near the C-terminus of helix 9 in all vertebrate and invertebrate CLICs (CLIC1 Tyr-233, Fig. 2). This residue marks the point where the DmCLIC and EXC-4 C-terminal extensions appear to deviate from the structures of the C-termini of the human CLICs (Fig. 1). Following this tyrosine residue, there are few interactions made between the C-terminal extensions and the body of the invertebrate CLIC molecules until a glutamate or glutamine 15 residues later [Figs. 3 (A,B), Glu-246, and Gln-262 in DmCLIC and EXC-4, respectively]. Consequently, this region appears to be relatively flexible, displaying higher B-factors as well as several breaks in the electron density. After this deviation away from the body of the molecule, there is a conserved proline (EXC-4 Pro-264; DmCLIC Pro-248) following which the C-terminal extensions then pass between helices 8 and 9 before running adjacent to helix 7 as an extended polypeptide [Figs 3(A,B)]. Finally, following a tight bend, the extreme Cterminal residues turn perpendicular to helix 7 near its N-terminus. At this point an isoleucine and proline residue from within the extension interact with a hydrophobic cluster centered around a conserved tryptophan residue from within helix 7 (EXC-4 Trp-221; DmCLIC Trp205). This isoleucine­proline pair is conserved in most invertebrate CLIC sequences (residues 270-1 and 254-5 in EXC-4 and DmCLIC, respectively). At this bend the C-terminal extensions of DmCLIC and EXC-4 differ. The remaining 5 residues of DmCLIC continue on as an extended chain while EXC-4, which has a longer C-terminal extension, forms an 11-residue helix 10. The surface on the CLIC module to which the C-terminal extension binds is rather flat. In both structures, the elongated region of the C-terminal extension interacts with the CLIC module via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which are largely mediated by side chains from the CLIC module [Figs 3(A,B)]. The corresponding side chains in the human CLIC structures are conserved or have similar properties to those in the invertebrate CLICs (Table II).

In the A subunit, the first seven N-terminal residues of EXC-4 are stabilized via a packing interaction with a symmetry related A subunit and they form an a-helix [Fig 3(C)]. This N-terminal helix (helix N) binds to a hydrophobic patch between helix 2 and the exposed face of the b-sheet. Tyr-5 makes hydrophobic interactions with Ala-68, Phe-69, and Phe-73 from helix 2, Tyr-22 from b-strand 1, Val-62 from b-strand 2, as well as a side chain hydrogen bond with Asn-72 from helix 2 [Fig. 3(C)]. The peptide chain linking helix N to b-strand 1 is extended. No density for such a helix was observed for the B subunit, although the distance between symmetry related B subunits is likely to be too large to allow this interaction.
Disruption of the putative redox site in EXC-4 but not in DmCLIC

Most CLIC proteins contain what appears to be a redox active cysteine residue at the N-cap position of helix 1 [Fig. 4 (A)]. In human CLICs, this is part of a sequence motif CP[FYS][ASC] which is similar to the CP[FY]C sequence of the glutaredoxins.4,33 DmCLIC contains a two-cysteine thioredoxin/glutaredoxin-like motif at the N-terminus of helix 1 (CLFC) [Fig. 4(B)]. The electron density within this region is clear with both cysteines appearing to be reduced. The residues in this CxxC motif adopt similar side chain and backbone conformations to the equivalent residues within the CLIC1 and CLIC4 structures. In contrast to DmCLIC, EXC-4 (like its paralogue EXL-1) is unique within the CLIC family in that it does not contain a cysteine residue within the N-cap position of helix 1. EXC-4 instead contains an aspartic acid residue forming a DxxC motif that is otherwise identical to that of DmCLIC. In the EXC-4 crystal structure the electron density of this region is clear, the single cysteine within the motif appears to be reduced and all residues adopt similar conformations to those in the other CLIC structures despite the presence of the aspartic acid [Figs. 4(A­C)].
Metal binding site

A bound metal ion was detected near the N-terminus of b-strand 3 in DmCLIC and both subunits of the EXC4 structure. The electron densities in these regions are commensurate with a bound Ca21 ion and there is also a weak anomalous signal supporting this assignation [Fig. 4(D)]. The affinity of this bound cation is likely to be high, as no divalent cations were present in any of the purification solutions (apart from 2.5 mM CaCl2 in the thrombin cleavage buffer) or crystallization solutions used in this work. Crystals of DmCLIC were grown in both the presence and absence of 100 mM EDTA. The

Lipid binding

Both CLIC1 and CLIC4 bind to artificial lipid bilayers in a manner that is significantly enhanced when the recombinant protein is oxidized.12,20 It has been hypothesized that this may be one of the regulatory factors that triggers shuttling of the proteins from the cytosol to cell membranes.12,13,20 DmCLIC and EXC-4 were assayed for lipid binding using surface plasmon resonance measurements on a Biacore L1 chip on which a lipid bilayer of phosphatidylcholine was formed. DmCLIC bound poorly at neutral pH (data not shown). However, a concentration dependent binding was observed at pH 5.5 [Fig. 5(A)]. In contrast, EXC-4 was seen to bind to lipid bilayers at pH 7.0 [Fig. 5(B)]. Unlike EXC-4, DmCLIC has a cysteine residue (Cys40) at the N-terminus of helix 1 [Fig. 4(B)]. The binding of DmCLIC to the lipid bilayer was considerably enhanced by oxidation in a manner similar to that previously reported for CLIC1 and CLIC412 [Figs. 5(C,D)]. By contrast, lipid bilayer binding of EXC-4, which lacks the redox active cysteine, was unaffected by oxidation

structures obtained from both types of crystal were identical, each showing a fully occupied metal site. The final DmCLIC structure described in this manuscript and deposited with the PDB (Accession code 2YV7) was obtained from a crystal grown in 100 mM EDTA. In both EXC-4 and DmCLIC, the metal ion is ligated on one side by the backbone carbonyl groups of the two residues prior to the cis-proline N-terminal to b-strand 3, this cis-proline is highly conserved in proteins containing a thioredoxin fold. The ion is ligated on its other side by the side chain carbonyl group of an asparagine residue at the N-terminus of helix 3 as well as a backbone carbonyl group from the N terminus of helix 3. The ion is also ligated by either one (DmCLIC) or two (EXC-4) water molecules. This Ca21 binding site seen in both invertebrate CLICs structurally overlaps the GSH binding site in the structurally related GST proteins. Therefore, the invertebrate CLICs are highly unlikely to bind GSH, at least not in a manner resembling GST proteins.

[Fig. 5(D)]. However, the binding of unmodified EXC-4 to the lipid bilayer was comparable with the binding of the oxidized version of the other CLICs [Fig. 5(D)].
Channel activity

Both tip dip electrophysiology and chloride efflux experiments have established that purified recombinant human CLIC1 and CLIC4 each produce anion channels in artificial lipid bilayers and promote the release of chloride ions from unilamellar phosphatidylcholine liposomes, respectively.9,12,20 Using tip­dip electrophysiology, channel activity was observed for both DmCLIC and EXC-4 (Figs. 6 and 7), but in the case of the latter, this was only at very low pH. DmCLIC produced channel openings at pH 6 where the base channel (Fig. 6, panel A) shows a conductance of 30 Æ 0.27 pS (n 5 4). Figure 6(B) shows current levels consistent with three independent 30 pS channels. Similar multiple channel openings were usually obtained during long experiments following rapid appearance of the first channel just after protein addition to the bath solution. With EXC-4, no channel activity was observed at pH 6 (result of seven independent experiments), however, channel openings occurred when the pH of the trans (bath) solution was acidified. Figure 7(A) shows examples of current recordings at pH 6 (left), pH 5 (centre), and pH 4 (right). At pH 5, channels were observed in three of six experiments, while at pH 4, they were observed in four of seven trials. Not only did the pH alter the probability of observing channels, but it also altered channel kinetics. Figure 7 shows the influence of the acidification on the mean open time of the single channel. At 150 mV membrane voltage, sopen was 1.5 Æ 0.2 ms, sclose was 1.1Æ 0.2 ms, and Po was 0.61 Æ 0.04 at pH 4. These values were significantly different from what was calculated for the data collected at pH 5: sopen was 23.5 Æ 0.3 ms, sclose was 53.8 Æ 0.4 ms, and Po was 0.35 Æ 0.06. As observed for the tip­dip electrophysiology, the percentage of chloride release in the valinomycin driven chloride efflux experiments is pH dependent for both EXC-4 and DmCLIC. The greatest release of chloride ions from the liposomes is only observed at low pH, in contrast to CLIC1 and CLIC4, which showed efflux activity at both low and high pH. Figure 8 shows that the chloride efflux for EXC-4 was observed only under acidic conditions at pH 5.0. DmCLIC efflux was observed at a higher pH up to neutral pH values. DISCUSSION The structures of two invertebrate CLIC proteins, DmCLIC and EXC-4 are presented. Although there are several salient differences, DmCLIC and EXC-4 are structurally closer to the mammalian CLICs than they are to

The data shown are representative of two independent experiments over the pH range of 5.0­9.0. Protein plus chloride loaded liposomes or control buffer (circles) plus chloride loaded liposomes were added to the required pH chloride-free buffer. About 1.4 lM of valinomycin was added to potentiate the chloride driven efflux from the liposomes and the chloride release monitored continuously for 240 s.

the structures of any other currently available GST-fold family members. This high degree of similarity between the structures of the invertebrate CLIC proteins and human CLIC1 and CLIC4, as well as phylogenetic analysis 18 (Littler, unpublished data), suggests that these proteins all share a common evolutionary ancestor. Whether this means they also share a common cellular role or molecular function is yet to be determined. It is clear that molecular and cellular function is conserved between invertebrate CLIC proteins, since DmCLIC and EXL-1 provide rescuing activity to exc-4 null mutant animals.18 The invertebrate CLIC proteins show two features that distinguish them from the mammalian CLICs: the presence of a bound divalent metal ion and the elongated Cterminal extension. An examination of aligned sequences of invertebrate CLICs (data not shown) indicates that the extended C-terminal structure is likely to be a general feature of invertebrate CLICs; however, this extension is not absolutely required for EXC-4 function as assayed in C. elegans, since chimeras between EXC-4 and the C-terminus of CLIC1 provide rescuing activity.18 The C-terminal extension contains a conserved P-x5-I-P motif (residues 264-271 in Exc-4 or 248-255 in DmCLIC), where the two prolines delineate the extended portion of this structure. The face of the CLIC module around helix 7 to which this C-terminal segment binds is similar to that found in the human CLIC structures (Table II). Thus, this surface of the CLIC module may also act as a peptide-binding site in the vertebrate CLIC structures. The location of the divalent cation site is of interest in that it occupies a region of the CLIC structure that overPROTEINS

laps with the equivalent binding site of the g-glutamyl moiety of GSH in the structurally homologous GSTs. This suggests that either the invertebrate CLICs do not bind GSH, or they do so in a manner that is distinct from the GST proteins. An impaired ability to bind GSH noncovalently is also seen in the mammalian CLICs, which distinguishes them from all GSTs other than the omega class GST.4,34 This impaired binding is reflected in the crystal structure of CLIC1 covalently complexed with glutathione where relatively few noncovalent interactions are made between the protein and the GSH molecule (pdb code 1K0N)4. Thus, it appears that although the mammalian CLICs can bind GSH covalently, the invertebrate CLICs have lost a significant portion of the GSH binding site because of the presence of the bound divalent cation. In terms of molecular function, EXC-4 and DmCLIC share several properties with human CLICs, viz the ability to bind lipid bilayers and to form ion channels in artificial lipid bilayers as measured by tip­dip electrophysiology and chloride efflux. The difference in the pH dependence of these properties (membrane binding versus channel activity) indicates that membrane binding and channel formation are not directly coupled. Specifically, while EXC-4 binds strongly to lipid bilayers at neutral pH, it does not show ion channel activity except at very low pH. Hence, membrane binding does not imply channel formation. The biological relevance of membrane binding and ion channel formation occurring as separate events for EXC4 may be interpreted in several ways. It is possible that in the case of EXC-4, membrane binding, which occurs at neutral pH, may mediate association between the membrane and the cytoskeleton, while channel formation, which was only observed below pH 6, may not occur in cells. This fits naturally with the observation in C. elegans that N-terminal GFP-EXC-4 fusion proteins rescue exc-4 null mutant phenotype.18 However, it is also conceivable that the pH dependence provides a means to regulate possible EXC-4 channel function independent of membrane binding. EXC-4 (like its paralogue EXL-1) is distinct from all other CLIC proteins in that the conserved redox-active cysteine at the N-terminus of helix 1 is replaced by an aspartic acid. EXC-4 shows other properties that distinguish it from both DmCLIC and the vertebrate CLICs. The binding of human CLIC1 and CLIC4 to artificial lipid bilayers is substantially increased by oxidation12 [Fig. 5(D)]. This is also observed for DmCLIC, but not for EXC-4 (Fig. 5). In the case of CLIC1, this may be due to the formation of the oxidized dimeric state;20 however, this cannot explain the observed result for CLIC4 or DmCLIC, as these proteins remain monomeric on oxidation. One possible explanation for the observation is that the cysteine residue at the N-terminus of helix 1 (Cys-24 in CLIC1, Cys-35 in CLIC4 and Cys-40 in

­ DmCLIC) requires oxidation to a sulphenic acid (RSO2), where it will have two oxygen atoms and a net negative charge, resembling aspartic acid, as seen in EXC-4 (and EXL-1). Thus, the replacement of the conserved cysteine by an aspartate residue in EXC-4 (and EXL-1) may obviate the need for redox regulation (note that the EXC-4 mutant D36N also rescues the exc-4 null mutant phenotype in C. elegans,18 thus the explicit negative charge on Asp-36 is not essential). The work of Berry and Hobert has shown that the Nterminal 66 residues of EXC-4 are necessary and sufficient to confer membrane localization in C. elegans.17,18 Although this peptide alone is not sufficient to rescue the exc-4 null mutant phenotype, chimeras consisting of EXC-4 residues 1-66 spliced into a GST-fold family protein rescue the phenotype in C. elegans.18 Thus, this region of the EXC-4 protein, called the PTM is of prime functional importance in the nematode. The fact that expression of DmCLIC or EXL-1 in C. elegans also rescues the exc-4 null mutant phenotype18 indicates that some common feature of the PTM region of the invertebrate proteins is crucial for function in the nematode. However, the PTM from human CLIC1 does not localize to the membrane nor does it rescue the exc-4 null mutant phenotype. The PTM comprises the N-terminal extension, bstrand s1, helix 1, and b-strand s2. Since C. elegans EXL1 rescues the exc-4 null mutant phenotype and EXL-1 lacks an N-terminal extension preceding b-strand s1, the N-terminal extension is unlikely to be crucial. A structure-based alignment (Fig. 2) of the two invertebrate CLIC proteins with human CLIC1 shows two regions where the invertebrate sequences are longer: the glycine rich loop between s1 and helix 1 (one residue longer) and helix 1, which is longer by one turn (four residues). The sequences of b-strands s1 and s2 are highly conserved (Fig. 2). Comparing the invertebrate CLIC proteins with the human CLICs, it seems unlikely that these regions are responsible for the observed differences in function in C. elegans.18 Thus, helix 1 and the adjacent loops are most likely to contain residues in the invertebrate CLIC proteins that are critical for membrane localization and functional rescue. Chimeras between human CLIC1 and C. elegans EXC-4, where only helix 1 is swapped, show that this region is necessary but not sufficient for function.18 A structural superposition of the human and invertebrate CLICs shows that in all cases, helix 1 is amphipathic. However, in the human sequences, the polar face is basic, while in the invertebrate CLIC proteins, it is acidic (Table III). The invertebrate structures contain an additional glutamate in the extra C-terminal turn of helix 1, but this residue does not lie on the same polar face of the helix. The importance of this change in the character of helix 1 for function in C. elegans is unclear. Alignment of the sequence of EXL-1 indicates that it, too, has a longer helix 1,

as per the invertebrate CLIC structures. The helix is basic (three histidines, a lysine and an arginine) although these residues do not appear to lie on the same face as per the structures of DmCLIC, EXC-4, CLIC1, and CLIC4. Because the sequence alignment of EXL-1 to other CLICs is ambiguous, a better understanding of the character of helix 1 in EXL-1 will need to be determined by structural analysis. Two key unanswered questions remain: what is the nature and structure of the ion channel formed by CLIC proteins and is the channel activity linked to part or all of the biological function of the CLICs? Our current model for the CLIC ion channel is based on the human CLIC sequences. An extended form of helix 1 covering residues Cys-24 to Val-46 has been proposed to form a transmembrane helix in the channel form of human CLIC1.3,6­8,12,35 The amphipathic character of this sequence in human CLIC proteins has made this an attractive, although controversial, proposal. However, the corresponding sequences of the two invertebrate CLIC proteins do not resemble amphipathic helices that are likely to form the pore of a chloride-specific channel, and yet at lower pH, channel activity has been observed in vitro for both proteins. For such channel activity to occur in all CLIC proteins, a significant amount of conformational unfolding of the N-domain of the soluble CLIC structures, and also possibly the C-domain, must occur for the PTM region to span the membrane bilayer. Thus, our initial ideas regarding the structure of the ¨ channel form of CLIC proteins may be naive and highlights the need for an experimental characterization of a CLIC channel structure.
