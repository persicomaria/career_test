ABSTRACT: Plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are thermal stable proteins that are capable of transferring lipid molecules between bilayers in vitro. This family of proteins, abundant in plants, is proposed to be involved in defense, pollination, and germination; the in vivo biological function remains, however, elusive. Here we report the purification and sequencing of an nsLTP1 from mung bean sprouts. We have also determined the solution structure of this nsLTP1, which represents the first 3D structure of the dicotyledonous nsLTP1 family. The global fold of mung bean nsLTP1 is similar to those of the monocotyledonous nsLTP1 structures and consists of four R-helices stabilized by four disulfide bonds. There are, however, some notable differences in the C-terminal tails and internal hydrophobic cavities. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to compare the thermodynamics and lipid transfer properties of mung bean nsLTP1 with those of rice nsLTP1. Docking of a lipid molecule into the solution structure of mung bean nsLTP1 reveals similar binding cavities and hydrophobic interactions as in rice nsLTP1, consistent with their comparable lipid transfer properties measured experimentally.

Plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs)1 facilitate the movement of various polar lipids across membranes in vitro (1). They are proposed to be involved in the formation of a protective hydrophobic layer over the plant surface (2) and in plant defense against pathogens (3, 4) and to be implicated in pollination and germination (5, 6). Elevated expression levels of nsLTPs under different environmental conditions suggested that they may be involved in responses toward stresses such as drought, heat, cold, or salt (7-9). Furthermore, high thermostability, protease resistance, and allergenic features of nsLTPs were reported (10). Despite the wealth of knowledge regarding their involvement in development and their ability in assisting stress managements, detailed mechanisms of their lipid transport and physiologic functions remain elusive (1, 11).

Plant nsLTPs can be divided into two subfamilies according to their molecular masses, namely, nsLTP1 (molecular mass 9 kDa) and nsLTP2 (molecular mass 7 kDa) (12). NsLTP1 is found primarily in aerial organs (13), whereas nsLTP2 is expressed in roots. Both nsLTP1 and nsLTP2 are found in seeds (11). The three-dimensional (3D) structures of several nsLTP1s from monocotyledonous plants have been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and X-ray crystallography (14-24). No dicotyledonous nsLTP1 structure is however currently available, although a number of nsLTP1s from dicotyledonous plant species have been isolated and sequenced (8, 25-27). Among those, the nsLTP1 from mung bean (Mb) was recently shown to exhibit antifungal and antibacterial activities (28). Here we report the purification, sequencing, and 3D structure determination of Mb nsLTP1 by solution NMR spectroscopy. Circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the thermodynamic and biological properties of the Mb nsLTP1 and compare them with that of rice nsLTP1. The observed differences in biophysical properties of nsLTP1 of Mb and rice are substantiated by comparing their sequences, 3D structures, and internal hydrophobic cavity environments in the light of their lipid transfer activity. Our results provide insight into the relationship between structure and function of dicotyledonous nsLTP1. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Purification. Rice nsLTP1 was purified from seeds (Oryza satiVa cv. Japonica) according to previously published protocol (29). The same protocol was used for Mb nsLTP1 with minor modifications. Mb seeds (Vigna radiata var. radiate) were obtained from a local supermarket and germi-

The supernatant was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 25 min to remove insoluble particles. The pH of the supernatant was then adjusted to 7.2 with sodium hydroxide before loading onto a cationexchange column, Sepharose (C-25) (Pharmacia, Inc.). Low-affinity proteins were washed with a washing buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) before eluting the eluent with a buffer containing 1 M sodium chloride. The solution containing the protein of interest and other basic proteins was desalted (<10 mM NaCl) and concentrated with an Amicon concentrator. Mb nsLTP1 was purified with RPHPLC using a COSMOSIL 5C18-AR300 semipreparative column (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid was used as the mobile phase. Finally, Mb nsLTP1 was eluted between 16% and 25% of acetonitrile concentration in 27 min while using a linear acetonitrile-water gradient at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/ min. Amino Acid Sequencing and Composition Analysis. The disulfide bonds of Mb nsLTP1 were reduced and modified according to the standard cysteine-modified protocols (30) for protein sequencing. The cysteine-modifying reagents, iodoacetic acid and 4-vinylpyridine, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Trypsin and Glu-C proteases were bought from Merck and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Iodoacetic acid modified Mb nsLTP1 (500 µg) was digested with 12.5 µg of trypsin in 1 mL of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). Similarly, 300 µg of 4-vinylpyridine alkylated protein was digested by 2.5 µg of Glu-C in 200 µL of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). After 2 h incubation, the tryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC using a COSMOSIL 5C18-AR-II analytical column with a linear gradient of 0-18% acetonitrile in 180 min and 18-38% in 30 min, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A similar procedure was followed after 8 h of Glu-C digestion, except for the linear acetonitrile gradient of 0-32% in 32 min, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The purified peptides were sequenced with automated Edman degradation methods (31) using MilleGen 6600 pulsed liquid protein sequencing systems. The molecular masses and amino acid compositions of the intact protein and various digested peptides were determined as described previously (29). The theoretical molecular mass was computed with PeptideMass (http://tw.expasy.org/tools/peptidemass.html). Circular Dichroism (CD) Experiments. The protein quantitation was carried out using bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce Chemical Co., Chester, U.K.) (32). All CD spectra were recorded with an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter using a 1 mm path length cuvette with protein concentrations of 16 µM. CD data were processed using KaleidaGraph (Synergy software). The solvent-substrate spectra except for chemical-induced unfolding were expressed in terms of mean residue ellipticity [] (MRE) in deg,cm2,dmol-1 from the ellipticity values in millidegrees (). Chemical- and temperature-induced unfoldings of the protein were monitored by the changes in the ellipticity signal at 222 nm. Individual CD spectra were averaged over three scans with a 0.5 nm step size with wavelengths ranging from 260 to

where n is the number of amino acids and  the observed ellipticity value at 222 nm. The thermal denaturation curve was obtained with Mb nsLTP1 in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. The spectra were recorded from 20 to 96 °C with a 2 °C increment. Chemical-induced unfolding of Mb and rice nsLTP1s was monitored with proteins in 10 mM phosphate buffer with increasing concentration of guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn,HCl) from 0 to 7 M. Protein solutions were equilibrated with various Gdn,HCl concentrations for 16 h at 25 °C prior to measurements. The reversibility of the protein folding was tested by recording CD spectra after dilution of Gdn,HCl content. The unfolding curves were fitted to a nonlinear least-squares analysis using the equation (34)

NMR Experiments and Assignments. All NMR experiments were carried out using a purified Mb nsLTP1 sample dissolved in 20 mM phosphate buffer (90% H2O and 10% D2O, pH 3.0) reaching a final sample concentration of 3 mM. Sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)[2,2,3,3-2H4]propionate (TSP-d4) was added as the internal standard. Homonuclear twodimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. The TOCSY spectra were recorded at 80 ms mixing time whereas the NOESY spectra were recorded at 100, 150, and 200 ms mixing time. All spectra were recorded with 512 t1 increments and 2048 t2 complex data points processed using XWIN-nmr (Bruker) and analyzed using SPARKY (35). The assigned resonances were deposited in BMRB under accession code BMRB-6089. Distance restraints were derived from the NOESY spectrum recorded with a 100 ms mixing time. A TOCSY spectrum was recorded after dissolving the lyophilized Mb nsLTP1 in 99% D2O at 25 °C for 36 h to identify the protected amide protons. Structural Calculation and Analysis. Peak lists and chemical shift lists were obtained from manual assignment using the SPARKY program. The peak intensities were derived using the default peak fitting protocol assuming Lorenzian line shapes. The structure calculations of Mb nsLTP1 were carried out using CNS 1.1 (36) and ARIA 1.2 (37) with torsion angle dynamics (TAD) and standard simulated annealing protocols. It was followed by explicit water refinement using the OPLS water model (38). Twelve structures with lowest total energies out of 200 structures

were selected for analyses. Their quality was assessed using PROCHECK-nmr (39). The atomic coordinates of the ensemble of structures were deposited into the PDB under the accession ID 1SIY. Superimposition of Mb onto maize (PDB ID: 1MZL), rice (PDB ID: 1RZL), wheat (PDB ID: 1GH1), and barley nsLTP1s (PDB ID: 1LIP) was obtained by least-squares positional fitting on backbone atoms of the whole protein (except the Ala1 and Gln21 in maize nsLTP1) using Swiss-Pdb Viewer v3.6 (40). The location and volume of the hydrophobic cavity were calculated using Voidoo, with a 1.4 Å probe radius and a 1.05 scaling factor for the van der Waals radii (41). If present, the ligand was removed before calculation. Atomic coordinates, rotated into six directions, were used for calculation of cavities. The solventaccessible surfaces of rice and Mb nsLTP1s were calculated using MSMS (42), with a 1.5 Å probe radius and a 1.0 vertex/Å2 triangulation density. Molecular modeling was conducted using the DOCKING module of the Insight II software package (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) with the AMBER force field. Coordinates for the ligand (myristate) were obtained from the structure of the maize nsLTP1myristate complex (PDB ID: 1FK2). The myristate molecule was docked into the hydrophobic cavity of Mb nsLTP1, the putative binding site. The structure of the ligand was further optimized by allowing structural flexibility after translation and rotation within the cavity. The conformation with the

lowest intermolecular energy was chosen for further refinement using the Discover 3 module in Insight II and subjected to 1000 steepest descent energy minimization steps. Proteinligand interactions were analyzed using Ligplot v.4.0 (43). Lipid Transfer Assay. Lipid transfer activities were assayed by fluorescence spectroscopy as described previously (44). Two microliters (0.118 mM) of pyrPtdCho and 10 µL (1 mg/mL) of Myr2PtdGro were solubilized in ethanol and mixed in a cuvette containing 8 µM protein in 2 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl/5 mM EDTA buffer (pH 7.4). Fluorescence intensities were monitored at 396 nm with excitation at 346 nm using a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 luminescence spectrometer at 25 °C. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Primary and Secondary Structure. The primary sequence of Mb nsLTP1 was established using N-terminal sequencing of the cysteine-alkylated Mb nsLTP1 and fragments obtained from proteolytic digestions (Figure 1A). Analysis of the first 47 residues of the cysteine-modified protein confirmed the presence of four conserved cysteines at positions 3, 13, 27, and 28. Trypsin digestion gave nine fragments which were designated T1-T9 according to their elution order. On the basis of the molecular weights, protein sequences, and amino acid composition analysis of these tryptic products, we

Various nsLTP1 sequences of dicotyledonous (p83434, p82534, p81651, p81402, and p27056) and monocotyledonous (1MZL, 1RZL, 1GH1, and 1LIP) plants were obtained from SWISS-PROT and the PDB database, respectively. Identical residues are highlighted by dark background; conserved and semiconserved residues are shaded and boxed, respectively. Sequence similarities (within parentheses) were derived by BLAST (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Residues involved in ligand binding (15, 18, 20, 24) are indicated with an asterisk. The two consensus pentapeptides (T/S-X-X-D-R/K and P-Y-X-I-S) that have been proposed to be important for catalysis or binding (11) are indicated at the bottom.

concluded that fragments T9, T7, T4, T1, and partially T5 comprise the first 47 residues. The arrangement of the remaining fragments (T2, T3, T6, and T8) was delineated by means of Glu-C digestion (Figure 1A) which leads to specific cleavage at the carbonyl end of glutamate residues. The modified Mb nsLTP1 was cleaved into two peptides, G1 and G2, with corresponding molecular masses of 2705 and 7453 Da, respectively. Sequencing the first 15 residues of peptide G1 allowed us to arrange T6-T8-T3 in order, and the complete primary structure of Mb nsLTP1 was thus obtained (Figure 1A). Mb nsLTP1 contains 91 amino acids including eight cysteine residues (positions 3, 13, 27, 28, 48, 50, 73, and 87) (Figure 1B) and includes two conserved pentapeptides among nsLTP1 family members, TTADR (residues 41-45) and PYKIS (residues 79-83). It has been proposed that these two consensus pentapeptides (T/S-X-X-D-R/K and P-Y-XI-S) are important for catalysis or binding (11). The primary sequence of Mb nsLTP1 shares high sequence similarity (60-80%) with other nsLTP1s (Figure 2). Mb nsLTP1 shows a typical R-helical CD spectrum at 25 °C (double minima at 222 and 208 nm and a maximum at 195 nm) (Figure 3) with a helical content of 33 ( 2%, according to eq 1 with MRE value []222 of -12500 ( 500

deg,cm2,dmol-1. Mb nsLTP1 was found to be very stable to heat denaturation at neutral pH as shown in the inset of Figure 3. Assignment of NMR Spectra and Structure Calculation of Mb nsLTP1. Proton resonance assignment of the purified Mb nsLTP1 was completed using standard protocol (45). Representative sequential assignments and NOE connectivities in the HN-HN region are shown in Figure 4. In total, 1595 distance restraints were derived from cross-peaks in the 100 ms NOESY spectrum (Table 1). The abundant i to i + 3 and i to i + 4 NOE connectivities and slow amide proton exchange rates (Supporting Information) are in agreement with the high helical content observed in the CD spectrum (Figure 3). Four conserved disulfide bonds (Cys3-Cys50, Cys13-Cys27, Cys28-Cys73, and Cys48-Cys87) among plant LTP1s were confirmed by the corresponding long-range NOEs and were introduced subsequently as distance restraints in structure calculation.

values with respect to the average structure for all backbone (N, CR, C) and all heavy atoms are 1.3 ( 0.3 and 1.7 ( 0.4 Å, respectively (Table 1). Mb nsLTP1 contains four R-helices with an unstructured C-terminal tail (Figure 5B). The first three helices are nearly parallel, whereas the fourth is shorter and perpendicular to the first one. This structure is stabilized by four disulfide bonds which respectively connect helix I to helix III (Cys3-Cys50), helix I to helix II (Cys13-Cys27), helix II to helix IV (Cys28-Cys73), and helix III to the C-terminal tail (Cys48-Cys87). The structure ensemble shows good convergence with no distance violations above 0.5 Å (Table 1). PROCHECK analysis reveals that 97% of the residues fall into the most favorable and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). Few residues fall into the disallowed region in the Ramachandran plot [residue Thr2 (3), Cys3 (1), Arg39 (2), Ala57 (1), Tyr79 (1), Lys80 (3), and Ile81 (1)]; their occurrence (indicated in parentheses) in the 12 selected structures is low. All these residues, except Cys3, reside in loop regions. Comparison with Homologous nsLTP1s. Mb nsLTP1 is highly homologous to other members of the nsLTP1 family (Figure 2). While Pro12, Pro24, Pro70, and Pro78 are highly conserved in all nsLTP1s, Pro12 (within an intervening 310 helix in helix I of rice nsLTP1) is replaced by a glutamine residue in Mb. In addition, Tyr16, conserved among all other nsLTP1s, is replaced by a phenylalanine residue in Mb nsLTP1. Among the 11 charged residues of Mb nsLTP1, 7 residues (Lys32, Arg39, Asp43, Arg44, Arg45, Lys52, and Lys72) are highly conserved, forming a positively charged patch on

the surface (Figure 5D). Notably, a number of highly conserved residues in monocotyledonous nsLTP1s are replaced in dicotyledonous nsLTP1 (Figure 2). For example, Gly23, Gly57, Ser68, Thr80, and Arg89 are replaced by Val, Ser/Ala, Ala, Lys, and Thr/Ser, respectively. Several experimentally determined structures of nsLTP1/ lipid complexes have revealed that the hydrophobic ligands are inserted into the internal cavity of nsLTP1s (15, 18, 20, 24). The volume of the hydrophobic cavity varies depending on the nature of the lipid molecules (24). Although AceAMP and HPS display a comparable global fold with respect to that of nsLTPs, the lack of a hydrophobic cavity makes them unable to carry lipids in vitro (46, 47). Structural analysis of nsLTP1-lipid complexes shows that residues in close contact with the lipid molecule are highly conserved. These highly conserved residues, indicated with an asterisk in Figure 2, are also observed in Mb nsLTP1. They form a tunnel-like hydrophobic cavity through the protein, suggesting that Mb nsLTP1s are capable of transferring lipid molecules. Among several monocotyledonous nsLTP1s, the sequences of maize and rice nsLTP1s are the closest to Mb nsLTP1 (70% similarity; see Figure 2). The 3D structure of Mb nsLTP1 therefore highly resembles that of maize and rice nsLTP1s (Figure 5C). Pairwise positional backbone RMSD values among Mb and selected monocotyledonous nsLTP1s are listed in Table 2. These nsLTP1s exhibit similar arrangement of their helices with some deviations in the C-terminal tails. Comparing with rice nsLTP1, the conformational changes of the C-terminal loop of Mb nsLTP1 (Figure 5C) result in a larger hydrophobic cavity volume. The hydrophobic cavity volume of the NMR ensemble of Mb nsLTP1 is 510 ( 45 Å3, while it is only 330 ( 44 Å3 for rice nsLTP1, which is 180 Å3 less than that of Mb nsLTP1 (Table 3). It has been reported that the C-terminal tail region of nsLTP1s undergoes significant conformational changes upon

ligand binding (24, 48). Tyr79, Ile81, and Arg44 are thought to be crucial for lipid binding or transfer activities of nsLTP1s (24, 48). Arg44 resides in the conserved motif (T/S-X-X-DR/K) of helix III in all nsLTP1s, while Tyr79 and Ile81 are located in the other conserved region (P-Y-X-I-S) in the C-terminal tail. Our solution structure of Mb nsLTP1 reveals that Arg44 and Tyr79 are located near the entrance of the hydrophobic cavity and interact with the polar headgroup of lipid molecules. Ile81 locates near the bottom of the lipid binding cavity, in which it may interact with the aliphatic chain of the lipid. The same interaction mode has been observed in rice nsLTP1. By contrast, Tyr79 and Ile81 of Mb nsLTP1 show different orientations as compared to that of rice nsLTP1. The CR atoms of Tyr79 and Ile81 of Mb nsLTP1 deviate from that of rice nsLTP1 by 3.4 and 3.6 Å, respectively (calculated after superposition of all backbone atoms). These two side chains point away from hydrophobic cavity, creating a larger cavity volume. Lipid Transfer ActiVity and Docking of a Lipid Molecule into Mb nsLTP1. In vitro studies have shown that nsLTP1s can transfer and/or exchange various phospholipids and glycolipid molecules across membranes (1). The binding/ transfer activity was thought to be related to the organization of the hydrophobic cavity (49). The lipid transfer activities

FIGURE 7: (A) Stereoview of the model of a Mb nsLTP1-myristate complex. Residues involved in the binding cavity are colored in green. The residues that interact with the ligand are shown in blue stick representation. The modeled ligand, myristate, is shown in ball-and-stick representation and the backbone of Mb nsLTP1 in ribbon representation. (B) Intermolecular interactions between Mb nsLTP1 and myristate. The figure was generated using Ligplot v.4.0 (43).

of rice and Mb nsLTP1 were studied with fluorescence spectroscopy by monitoring the increase in fluorescence due to the transfer of pyrene moieties from quenched donor vesicles to unquenched acceptor vesicles (50). The addition of protein (Mb or rice nsLTP1) to the sample induces a gradual increase in fluorescence intensity (Figure 6). In contrast to the previous comparison of lipid transfer properties of maize and wheat nsLTP1s whose activities are related to their respective cavity volume (49), Mb and rice nsLTP1s show similar lipid transfer activities, albeit a significant 35% smaller hydrophobic cavity of the latter (see previous section). To address whether disulfide bonds play an essential role in stabilizing the active conformation of Mb nsLTP1, lipid transfer activities of cysteine-modified Mb and rice

nsLTP1 were measured. Lipid transfer activity was eliminated by reduction and modification of the disulfide bonds (data not shown). This indicates that the disulfide bondstabilized structure is a prerequisite for lipid transfer activity. To gain further insights into the lipid binding mode of Mb nsLTP1, we performed in silicon docking of a fatty acid into the hydrophobic cavity of Mb nsLTP1. This cavity is indeed a plausible ligand binding site. Docking of a myristate molecule into the hydrophobic cavity of Mb nsLTP1 results in an expansion of the cavity volume from 510 to 1142 Å3. A similar result was observed in the rice nsLTP1-myristate complex (PDB ID: 1UVA) (48), whose hydrophobic cavity volume is 1100 Å3. The lipid molecule is enclosed by the four helices of Mb nsLTP1 which form a hydrophobic cavity

FIGURE 8: Chemical denaturations of Mb and rice nsLTP1s. Normalized CD signals at 222 nm are displayed as a function of increasing Gdn,HCl at pH 3.0 (regular triangle), pH 7.0 (circle), and pH 10.0 (inverted triangle) for Mb nsLTP1 (filled symbols) and rice nsLTP1 (open symbols). The curves were fitted with the nonlinear least-squares analysis according to a two-state model to show the fraction of unfolded.

with the following residues: Val6, Asn9, Leu10, Cys13, and Leu17 of helix I; Val31, Ile34, and Leu35 of helix II; Val47 and Leu51 of helix III; Ile61, Asn65, Ala66, Leu69, and Pro70 of helix IV; and Ile77 and Tyr79 of the C-terminal region. The myristate is positioned similarly to those in complex with other nsLTP1s with a 1:1 binding mode (24, 48). The polar head of the myristate lies in the cavity opening near the C-terminal part of Mb nsLTP1, whereas its hydrophobic tail points toward loop L3 (Figure 7). This model reveals some potential protein-ligand interaction sites similar to the ones observed in the rice nsLTP1-ligand complex. Leu10, Cys13, Leu17, Ala66, and Leu69 interact with the aliphatic atoms C10 to C14 of the myristate at the bottom of the binding pocket while Asn9, Leu35, Val47, and Tyr79 are in close contact with the aliphatic atoms C2 to C9. Arg44, on the other hand, forms the lid of the cavity and interacts with the headgroup of myristate. In conclusion, Mb and rice nsLTP1-myristate complexes display similar organization and volume of the internal hydrophobic cavity. Upon ligand binding, the hydrophobic cavities of both proteins expend. These results imply that the plasticity of nsLTP1s is essential for the formation of nsLTP1-lipid complexes and accounts for the similar lipid transfer activities. Comparisons of the Thermodynamic Properties of Rice and Mb nsLTP1. The protein stability has been shown to decrease with the increasing size of the hydrophobic cavity (51, 52). To study the relationship between hydrophobic cavity size and structural stability, the thermodynamic properties of Mb and rice nsLTP1s were compared using CD spectroscopy. Normalized CD spectra at three pH values between 3.0 and 10.0 are shown in Figure 8. Mb nsLTP1 requires a higher concentration of Gdn,HCl (6.5 M) than rice nsLTP1 (4.5 M) to be fully denatured. We used nonlinear least-squares regression to fit the chemical-induced unfolding data (53). Thermodynamic parameters were derived under the assumption of a two-state model (Table 3), and the results revealed that both Mb and rice nsLTP1s exhibit maximum stability around neutral pH. Note that Mb nsLTP1 is less stable than rice nsLTP1 [G°(H2O) ) 5.7 kJ,mol-1; see

where m is a measure of the cooperativity of the unfolding process and is proportional to the surface area exposed to solvent upon unfolding (54). The absolute m value of Mb (3.9 kJ,mol-1,M-1) is smaller than that of rice nsLTP1 (7.2 kJ,mol-1,M-1) (Table 3). This is in agreement with the solvent-accessible surface areas of Mb and rice nsLTP1s, which are 5187 ( 93 and 5844 Å2, respectively. Briefly, the lower m value suggests that the transition from the folded to the unfolded state of Mb nsLTP1 is less cooperative than that of rice (55). Mb nsLTP1 has a lower G°(H2O) than rice nsLTP1, which is consistent with hydrophobic cavity values calculated from their structures. Probable Role of nsLTP1 as Plant Defensin. Next to their passive role of nsLTP1s in formation of structural barriers such as cutin, they are found to exhibit an active role in plant defense (13). They show antimicrobial activities, and some nsLTP1s genes are inducible upon pathogen attack (13). Accumulation of nsLTP1s at the plant surface site in contact with fungi (56-58) is evidence of their role in plant defense. In addition, nsLTP1s can work in synergy with thionin, a plant defense peptide, to inhibit fungi growth (59). Recently, Mb nsLTP1 has been shown to exert antifungal action toward Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium aphanidermatum, and Sclerotium rolfsii (28). Coincubation of Mb nsLTP1 with the Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus can cause cytoplasmic leakage in vitro (28). Unlike wheat nsLTP1, which acts as an elicitin antagonist (4), Mb nsLTP1 kills bacteria by destructing their cell wall (28). Either the 3D structure or the antimicrobial activities of nsLTP homologues have been reported previously. We have shown here, for the first time, the solution structure of a nsLTP1 from Mb with known antimicrobial activity (28). The antimicrobial activity may be attributed to the amphipathic nature of Mb nsLTP1, on the surface of which a basic patch is formed by clustered cationic residues (Figure 5D). Clustered distributions of cationic and hydrophobic residues are common features of antimicrobial peptides (60). Like several known plant defensive peptides, the positively charged face may bind to the negatively charged membrane surface of microorganisms (61). Our structure may thus shed new light on the structure-function relationship of nsLTPs' antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSIONS We have described the purification, identification, and 3D structure determination of nsLTP1 from Mb sprout with structural characteristics of the lipid transfer protein family. Its thermostability (Tm > 80 °C), lipid transfer activity, and 3D structure highly resemble the maize and rice nsLTP1s, implying that nsLTP1s of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants may play a similar role in managing stresses and defending pathogens. Although the volume and organization of the internal cavity exhibit subtle differences from one nsLTP1 to another, similar lipid transfer activities suggest that their plasticity rather than the volume of their hydrophobic cavity is a determinant of their ability to transfer lipids.

Characterization and Analyses of Mung Bean nsLTP1 The hydrophobic interior of proteins is usually believed to be tightly packed and has been shown to have very low compressibility (62). The presence of a large internal cavity in nsLTP1s is quite remarkable in terms of folding and stability. Our denaturant-induced unfolding assay has revealed that Mb nsLTP1 is less stable and shows less cooperative unfolding than rice nsLTP1. Despite the similar global 3D structures among several nsLTP1s, minor/local structural differences influence their stability and folding. The structural features of Mb nsLTP1 should provide new insights into their biological role in the defense against plant pathogens. A more systematic analysis of the structures and corresponding lipid binding/transfer properties as well as antimicrobial activity should clarify the biological role(s) of this class of proteins.
