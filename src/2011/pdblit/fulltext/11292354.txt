Celera, 180 Kimball Way South San Francisco CA 94080, USA An extensive structural manifold of short hydrogen bond-mediated, active site-directed, serine protease inhibition motifs is revealed in a set of over 300 crystal structures involving a large suite of small molecule inhibitors (2-(2-phenol)-indoles and 2-(2-phenol)-benzimidazoles) determined over a wide range of pH (3.5 ­11.4). The active site hydrogen-bonding mode was found to vary markedly with pH, with the steric and electronic properties of the inhibitor, and with the type of protease (trypsin, thrombin or urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA)). The pH dependence of the active site hydrogen-bonding motif is often intricate, constituting a distinct fingerprint of each complex. Isosteric replacements or minor substitutions within the inhibitor that modulate the pKa of the phenol hydroxyl involved in short hydrogen bonding, or that affect steric interactions distal to the active site, can significantly shift the pH-dependent structural profile characteristic of the parent scaffold, or produce active site-binding motifs unique to the bound analog. Ionization equilibria at the active site associated with inhibitor binding are probed in a series of the protease­ inhibitor complexes through analysis of the pH dependence of the structure and environment of the active site-binding groups involved in short hydrogen bond arrays. Structures determined at high pH (. 11), suggest that the pKa of His57 is dramatically elevated, to a value as high as , 11 in certain complexes. Ki values involving uPA and trypsin determined as a function of pH for a set of inhibitors show pronounced parabolic pH dependence, the pH for optimal inhibition governed by the pKa of the inhibitor phenol involved in short hydrogen bonds. Comparison of structures of trypsin, thrombin and uPA, each bound by the same inhibitor, highlights important structural variations in the S1 and active sites accessible for engineering notable selectivity into remarkably small molecules with low nanomolar Ki values.

Elaborate, Short H-bond Manifold at Active Site

harnesses this unusual inhibition paradigm has accelerated development of potent, selective, remarkably small inhibitors of the protease drug targets, uPA, thrombin, factor VIIa and factor Xa. Herein we present crystal structures and corresponding inhibition constants for the binding to trypsin, thrombin, and uPA of several dozen inhibitors elaborated from the archetype scaffolds, 2-(2-phenol)-5-amidinoindole and 2-(2-phenol)-5amidinobenzimidazole. In many cases the structures of all three proteases bound by a common inhibitor are determined and compared to dissect selectivity determinants. Inhibitor elaborations involve subtle modifications, often isosteric or one-atom substitutions, at loci interacting with the S1, S10 or active site. Many of these alterations exert profound and sometimes unexpected effects on structure, affinity and selectivity, owing to equally subtle but discriminating features in the S1, S10 and active sites of each individual protease. Whether or not low-barrier, covalent-like hydrogen bonds can significantly stabilize the transition state of catalysis at a polar active site of an enzyme appreciably more than electrostatic, ionic hydrogen bonds is a much debated issue.9 ­ 25 Numerous theoretical and experimental model system studies have attempted to assess the additional strength of low-barrier short hydrogen bonds over normal ones to determine their contribution to enzymatic catalysis.20 ­ 25 The crystal structures described herein provide unparalleled, high-resolution visualizations of very short hydrogen bonds made by inhibitors at actual enzyme active sites. These hydrogen bonds are essentially electrostatic, involving dissimilar pKa values of the constituent groups, which are located within a highly polar environment. Despite their severe shortness the hydrogen bonds provide only modest enhancements in inhibitor affinities (about 20-fold) over that conferred by typical-length hydrogen bonds,1,2 and are thus dramatically less stabilizing than proposed for covalent-like, low-barrier active site hydrogen bonds.9,10 Crystallographic titration of ionization equilibria involved in ligand binding is a largely uncharted, but potentially insightful approach for probing mechanisms of binding,26 often allowing inference of the pKa values of ionizable groups involved in binding.1,27 ­ 29 Crystallography and enzymology as a function of pH demonstrates that ionization is required for short hydrogen bond formation at the active site of the protease­inhibitor complexes of this study.1 The relative pH-independence of the active site hydrogen bonding in some complexes suggests significant shifts in the pKa values of some of the participating active site groups. Crystal structures at multiple pH values indicate that an increase in the pKa of the phenol hydroxyl of the inhibitor involved in short hydrogen bonds can stabilize the short hydrogen bond arrays at high pH. Stabilization is accompanied by a dramatic elevation of the pKa of His57, to values as high as 11. Protease­inhibitor crystal structures determined

from pH 3.5 to 11.4 show that the inhibitors generally remain fully bound and well ordered over this large pH range, affording rare views of protein­ ligand structures at extremes of both low and high pH. The bound inhibitors, although highly conformationally constrained, show a remarkable capacity to adjust to changes in pH and in target enzyme. The versatility of ordered water in defining alternate inhibition-binding paradigms produces a surprisingly extensive, intricate structural manifold of both short and ordinary hydrogenbonding modes at the protease active site. The diverse active site hydrogen-bonding modes observed as a function of pH constitute a distinct structural fingerprint of each complex, determined by the steric and electronic features of the associated inhibitor. The structures and complementary inhibition constants determined as a function of pH encompass a systematic exploration of the structural and functional effects of alterations in the target enzyme, in the active sitedirected inhibitor, and in the pH. An elaborate, active site binding manifold is thus assembled from several hundred high-resolution crystal structures and complementary Ki data to characterize novelbinding motifs, probe the inhibition mechanisms and guide structure-based design of potent selective inhibitors of serine proteases.

Results
Elaboration of short hydrogen bond-mediated inhibitors of serine protease drug targets Figure 1 shows the chemical structures of short hydrogen bond-forming benzimidazole and indole scaffolds developed as inhibitors of trypsin-like serine protease drug targets such as uPA, factor Xa and factor VIIa. Conversion of the benzimidazole to an indole and addition of an S10 -directed phenyl group to the archetype and simplest short hydrogen bond-mediated inhibitor, CRA-1144,1 resulted in the potent (low-nanomolar) but nonselective uPA inhibitor, CRA-8696.2 ­ 5 Remarkable selectivity for Ser190 protease targets like uPA over Ala190 protease anti-targets like tPA was engineered through incorporation of a 6-halo group, ortho to the S1 amidine, as in CRA-10302.4,5 Selectivity, up to 100-fold, toward uPA against all other anti-targets was achieved by optimization of an S10 -directed substituent attached through an ether linkage ortho to the phenol hydroxyl, as in CRA-11092.4,8 Alteration of the R group, directed toward solvent, allowed optimization of solubility, of other pharmacodynamic properties and of the pKa of the phenol hydroxyl. The resulting suite of compounds in Figure 1 embodies a rich repertoire of active site-directed, reversible small molecule protease inhibitors that serve not only as drug leads but also as probes into structural and mechanistic aspects of short hydrogen bondmediated protease inhibition.

Figure 1. Schematic of H2Ooxy-mediated, three and four-centered, short hydrogen bond networks, showing chemical structures of compounds (blue). Three-centered short hydrogen bonds and associated atoms are red. Additional short hydrogen bonds and associated atoms in the four-centered, H2Ooxy-mediated short hydrogen bond motif are green The "inner" benzimidazole nitrogen is at position 1, and the outer one at position 3.

Factors that modulate the pKa of the phenol of the unbound inhibitor The experimentally determined pKa values of the phenol hydroxyl of the unbound inhibitor, pKa(f-OH), are listed in Table 1. This pKa can be modulated (with minimal change in protein ­ inhibitor interactions) by through-bond induction or resonance from an electron-donating or withdrawing group introduced para to the phenol hydroxyl (the R group in Figure 1), at a position directed toward the solvent. It can also be changed by through-space electrostatic interactions from a charged group at this position, or from internal hydrogen bonds to Ophenol. The structural studies that follow show that a negative charge localized on the phenol oxygen of the unbound inhibitor stabilizes the active site short hydrogen bond network in the complex, whereas a more delocalized negative charge destabilizes it. Appendix A summarizes and discusses the effects of substituents on pKa(f-OH). Multi-centered, H2Ooxy-mediated, short hydrogen bond arrays in complexes of simple, active site-directed inhibitors Trypsin complexes of CRA-1144 analogs display a multi-centered short hydrogen bond motif

involving the inhibitor phenol oxygen, the Ser195 hydroxyl, and a water molecule (H2Ooxy) co-bound in the oxyanion hole (Figure 1). This multi-centered short hydrogen bond motif1 is observed over a large pH range for trypsin complexes of simple CRA-1144 analogs lacking an S10 -directed substituent. Crystallography and enzymology demonstrated that formation of the short hydrogen-bonded motif in Figure 1 involves ionization of the inhibitor phenol and of His57 to form an ionic hydrogen bond cluster in trypsin, thrombin, uPA, and factor Xa.1,2 For many trypsin complexes at low pH the short hydrogen bond network is a four-centered array in which six short or very short hydrogen bonds connect all atoms of a tetrahedron defined by Og , Ooxy, Ophenol and Nbenzimidazole/indole (Figure 1), Ser195 as in trypsin-CRA-1802, pH 6.4 (Figure 2). Hydrogen bond lengths for four trypsinCRA-1802 structures between pH 4.5 and 7.3 ° Og are: Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol ¼ 2.20(^ 0.05) A, Ser195 ­ ° , Ooxy ­Ophenol ¼ 2.15(^ 0.04) A, ° Ooxy ¼ 2.25(^ 0.10) A °, Nbenzimidazole ­ Nbenzimidazole ­ Ooxy ¼ 2.42(^ 0.06) A ° and Nbenzimidazole ­ Og Ser195 ¼ 2.45(^ 0.04) A ° Ophenol ¼ 2.48(^ 0.03) A. These very short O ­ O distances are comparable to that in the (H3O2) ­ ° anion (2.29 A).30 In these multi-centered arrays some of the hydrogen bonds, such as those involving the benzimidazole or indole nitrogen are partial, or "trifurcated". Active site hydrogen bond lengths for all the structures of this study are given in Table S1 of the Supplementary Material. For several of the short hydrogen bond arrays in this investigation, hydrogen bond angles are given by Katz et al.2 At low pH, protonation of the benzimidazole can be inferred, as in the structures of trypsin-CRA1144 (pH 3.5) and trypsin-CRA-6669 (pH 3.6) where both benzimidazole nitrogen atoms donate hydrogen bonds, the outer one to a co-bound sulfate.1 Protonation of the benzimidazole contributes to the ionic nature of the hydrogen bonds involving the inner benzimidazole nitrogen, and may thereby stabilize the four-centered short hydrogen bond array. Disengagement from the active site at high pH of simple, short hydrogen bond-forming, nonS10 -directed inhibitors Above a critical pH value that depends on the pKa of the inhibitor phenol short hydrogen bondforming analogs without an S10 -directed substituent disengage from the active site through a
 The possibility that the species in the oxyanion hole is Naþ was excluded by extensive soaking (two consecutive soaks, seven days each) of an inhibitor-free trypsin crystal in a CRA-1144 solution completely free of Naþ. (The pH was adjusted from 3.5 to 4.9 with NH4OH.) ° The structure (1.40 A resolution) is the same as that resulting from soaking in a buffered solution at the same pH.

Values in bold indicate that competitive inhibition was demonstrated, and Ki values determined rigorously by varying both the substrate and the inhibitor concentration, as described.1,42 For bovine trypsin the DMSO concentration is 2.5%, whereas it is 10.0% for the other enzymes. a Standard deviations for pKa values (in brackets) were determined from two or more separate samples. pKa values were determined either potentiometrically or by UV­visible spectroscopy (see Materials and Methods). For relatively insoluble compounds different percentages of the indicated co-solvent were used, and pKa values were extrapolated to 0% co-solvent. pKa(f-OH) values in italics were estimated (due to insufficient material for experimental determination) based on analysis of the other experimental values. b Inhibitors with R ¼ succinate have local minima indicated in italics.

The two other listed pKa values also obtained are both in the range for the phenol hydroxyl. The higher value (8.04) is essentially the same as for the phenol in the parent (CRA7806, pKa(f-OH) ¼ 8.01), while the lower value is expected if an electrostatic effect is exerted by the positively charged amine.

small pivoting about the amidine that shifts the phenol away from the active site. For simple benzimidazoles, such as CRA-1144, CRA-1801, CRA-1802, CRA-6669, and CRA-9785, the disengagement is a two-state process involving transition of the active site-engaged, three-centered short hydrogen-bonding network (Figures 2 and 3(a)) to the active site-disengaged-binding mode (Figure 3(b)), and deprotonation of His57. Rotation of the phenol ring by 1808, and tautomerization of the benzimidazole results in an internal hydrogen bond between the phenol hydroxyl and the outer benzimidazole nitrogen (N3). This conformation of the active site-disengaged benzimidazole (Figure 4(a), A and B) is calculated ab initio to be the most stable one1 due to withdrawal of electrons through resonance by the amidine from the outer benzimidazole nitrogen (N3). At pH values near the transition pH the active site-engaged and disengaged-binding modes can be crystallographically resolved (Figure 3(b)). For other analogs a more elaborate response to an increase in pH, involving discrete disordering of Ser195 and/or dissociation of H2Ooxy, precedes disengagement of the inhibitor phenol from the active site. These changes at the active site incurred by raising the pH produce alternate short hydrogen bond inhibition modes, some of which have been described.2 Figure 5 color codes the active site hydrogen-bonding modes crystallographically observed as the pH is varied from 4 to 11 for simple analogs without an S10 -directed substituent (a), and for more elaborated scaffolds (b) ­ (f). Over 300 crystal structures are represented in Figure 5, each by a box. Table S1 provides the corresponding active site hydrogen bond lengths. Diversity in active site, short hydrogen bond arrays involving bound inhibitors with an S10 directed substituent Most trypsin complexes exhibit many distinct, well-defined active site hydrogen bonding modes

as a function of pH. Short to very short hydrogen ° bond motifs (defined as those with O ­ O , 2.50 A ° ) include: four-centered (Ooxy, and N ­O , 2.55 A OSer195, Ophenol, Nbenzimidazole/indole) (Figures 1 and 2), three-centered (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) (Figure 3(a)), Ser195 and two-centered (Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol). There are a variety of two-centered motifs, in which Ser195 is either ordered or discretely disordered, each conformer donating either a short or an ordinary hydrogen bond to Ophenol. Other short hydrogen bond motifs involving a water molecule (H2OS2) co-bound on the S2 side of the inhibitor, are described later. Categorization of both short and normal hydrogen-bonding modes (into over 30 distinct types), often involving equilibria among the motifs described above, is given in the legend to Figure 5. Stabilization of multi-centered, H2Ooxymediated, short hydrogen bond array by an increase in pKa of the phenol hydroxyl In Figure 5(a) the simple, non-S10 -elaborated scaffolds are ordered by the pKa value of the phenol hydroxyl (pKa(f-OH)), which is modulated by an electron-donating or withdrawing group para to the phenol. There is a strong correlation (coefficient ¼ 0.99) between pKa(f-OH) and the pH at which the inhibitor disengages from the active site (Figure 6). The disengagement pH values, where there are equal occupancies of active site-engaged and disengaged inhibitor components (see Figure 3(b)) (represented by a dotted diagonal line in Figure 5(a)) vary smoothly from 9.9 for CRA-1801 (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 7.69) to 11.1 for CRA8328 (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 9.10) (Figure 6). While the electron-donating p-OCH3 group of CRA-6669 (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 8.45) stabilizes the short hydrogen bond network (disengagement pH ¼ 10.5), the structurally similar but electron-withdrawing p-OCF3 group in CRA-9785 (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 7.83) destabilizes it (disengagement pH ¼ 9.8).

More complex pH dependence of active site structure of complexes involving S10 directed inhibitors The pH dependence of the active site structure of trypsin complexes involving an S10 -directed inhibitor group (Figure 5(b) ­ (f)) is more complex than that of the complexes with the simpler inhibitors in Figure 5(a).2 The inhibitors in Figure 5(b) ­(f) are also differentiated from the simpler analogs in Figure 5(a) by remaining fully ordered and hydrogen bonded at the active site up to the high pH limit (, 11) of crystal stability. The pH dependencies of the structures of trypsin-CRA-7806, trypsinCRA-8696, and thrombin-CRA-7806 (from pH 4.5 to 11.0) have been described.2 Trypsin-CRA-7806 displays multi-centered short hydrogen bonding arrays, either exclusively or in equilibrium with ordinary hydrogen bonds, up to pH 9.9 (Figure 5(b), #9). The equilibrium involves discrete disorder of Ser195 between conformer 1 (x1 ¼ 276(^9)8) and conformer 2 (x1 ¼ 224(^8)8). For conformer 2 occupies the oxyanion hole, displacing Og Ser195 H2Ooxy. The abrupt lengthening of the active site hydrogen bonds above pH 9.9 and presence of only

ordinary hydrogen bonds above pH ,10.7 (Table S1) is associated with a subtle shift of bound CRA7806 away from the active site.2 Pronounced effect of benzimidazole to indole substitutions on pH dependence of active site structure The active site structure and its pH dependence is usually considerably sensitive to the isosteric change in inhibitor scaffold from benzimidazole to indole, as observed in a number of comparisons involving these isosteres. This sensitivity reflects the different chemical nature of the indole versus benzimidazole nitrogen, which usually participates in short and/or normal hydrogen bonds (Figure 1). Moreover, benzimidazole to indole replacements also incur an increase in pKa(f-OH), by as high as 1.3 unit (Table 1). Often the increase in pKa(f-OH) from a benzimidazole to indole replacement is associated with an increase in the stability of the short hydrogen bond network at high pH. For example, in the trypsin complex with the simplest short hydrogen bond-forming indole, CRA-8328 (Figure 5(a), #6)

(pKa(f-OH) ¼ 9.10), the short hydrogen bonds are stable to pH , 11, whereas they begin to disappear at pH 10.1 (and are absent by pH 10.9) in the complex with the benzimidazole isostere, CRA-1144 (Figure 5(a), #4) (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 8.22).
 Similarly, the binding of the indole, CRA-9076 (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 7.42), with an S10 -directed bromo, is mediated by short hydrogen bonds at all pH values examined (Figure 5(b), #8), while the binding of the benzimidazole isostere, CRA-9334 (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 6.95), is mediated predominantly by normal hydrogen bonds above pH 7.0 (Figure 5(b), #7). Finally, for the trypsin complex of the indole, CRA-10433 (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 9.56), with an S10 -directed ortho O-cyclopentyl group, the threecentered (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) short hydrogen bond array Ser195 is stable to pH 9.1 (Figure 5(b), #13), but only to pH 7.0 in the benzimidazole complex, trypsin-CRA-10655 (Figure 5(b), #12), with the lower pKa(f-OH) of 8.22.

Besides differences in the upper pH limit for short hydrogen bond formation, there are other substantial differences between the trypsin complexes of indole and benzimidazole isosteres at lower pH values.2 Benzimidazole to indole replacements do not always stabilize short hydrogen bonds at all pH values. Furthermore, the pH profile of the benzimidazole and indole isosteres can markedly differ from one another, not only with respect to hydrogen bond lengths, but also with respect to the type and variety of hydrogen bond networks observed as a function of pH, as evident in the comparison of trypsin-CRA-7806 (Figure 5(b), #9) with trypsin-CRA-8696 (Figure 5(b), #10).

For CRA-1801 only, the W group in the central phenol is N (see Figure 1).

In (a), the structures of trypsin-CRA-1144 (pH 3.5) and trypsin-CRA-6669 (pH 3.6), out of the pH range of the Figure, are represented by boxes at pH 4.3. Interpolations of transitions between binding modes in (b)­ (f), where compounds are fully bound over the entire pH range, is based on occupancies of H2Ooxy, H2OS2, the alternate conformers of Ser195, and/or on the structures of the complex at bracketing pH values. W indicates a water molecule that is near but no longer in the center of the oxyanion hole. A bold vertical line represents a potential discontinuity in the pH dependence incurred by changing the soaking solution from MgSO4 (pH , 9.0) to citrate (pH . 9.0). For clarity the data in (b) for entries 8 and 9 (trypsin-CRA-9076 and trypsin-CRA-7806, respectively) are repeated in (e) (entries 36 and 28, respectively).

° (Figure 5(c)) bind about 1 A deeper in the S1 sites of uPA and trypsin than non-halo parents, with the halo displacing a water (H2O1S1) from the S1 site (Figure 7). The trypsin-6-haloindole complexes all exhibit similar, relatively pH-indepen Because of the greater depth of inhibitor binding at S1 and change in inhibitor orientation, the position of the phenol hydroxyl at the active site is also altered. Therefore to assess the effects of alterations of pKa(f-OH) alone on short hydrogen bond arrays at the active site, comparisons should be made within the 6-halo inhibitor complexes or within the non-halo counterparts and not between these two classes.

The two-centered Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol hydrogen bond in these complexes ° (2.47(^ 0.11) A for 16 structures over the entire pH range) is not as short as in other, non-halo complexes such as trypsin-CRA-14783 (Og Ser195 ­ ° Ophenol ¼ 2.04(^ 0.12) A for 11 structures over the entire pH range). The indole nitrogen does not make hydrogen bonds with trypsin in any of the trypsin-6-haloindole complexes. Furthermore, H2Ooxy is not co-bound (Figure 8), except in

° Figure 9. Structure and ð2lFo l 2 lFc lÞ; ac map for trypsin-CRA-10762, pH 5.7, 1.50 A resolution. The edge of the distal phenyl of bound CRA-10762 interacts with the edge of the His57 imidazole, with the planes of these interacting aromatic groups roughly parallel. In other active site-binding modes of trypsin-CRA-10762, the distal phenyl stacks against (perpendicular to) His57, as in the complexes in Figure 7. The active site hydrogen-bonding mode for trypsin-CRA-10762 at the highest pH values, 10.4 and 11.0, is similar to that at the lowest pH values (pH , 6.3). In the high pH structures of this complex deprotonation of His57 is possible simply by a change in the orientation of H2OS2 from that in the low-pH structures.

trypsin-CRA-11417 at the lowest pH (4.7). One final feature of most 6-haloindole (or 6-halobenzimidazole) complexes of uPA, trypsin, and thrombin resulting from the deeper binding of the 6-halo scaffolds at S1, is the additional, "diagonal", N1 ­ Od2 Asp189 hydrogen bond (Figure 8). Short N12 ­ Ophenol hydrogen bonds His57 Trypsin-CRA-10991 (Figure 5(c), #15 and Figure 8) stands out from the other complexes in the shortness of the N12 ­ Ophenol hydrogen bond, His57 ° ° , 2.60 A (pH , 10.2), as short as 2.51 A (pH 9.3). Some of the other complexes also exhibit short N12 ­ Ophenol hydrogen bonds over a more His57 limited pH range (Figure 5, Table S1), notably, CRA-11092 (Figure 5(c), #21), where the hydrogen ° bond is as short as 2.50 A at pH values as high as pH 10.9. Trypsin-CRA-10991 (Figure 5(c), #15) also appears to differ from the three other trypsin-6haloindole complexes that display similar, relatively pH-independent active site structures (Figure 5(c), #16­ 18) in its somewhat shorter ° Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol hydrogen bond (2.29(^ 0.10) A versus ° 2.47(^ 0.11) A) over the entire pH range. The 12 shorter Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol and NHis57 ­ Ophenol hydrogen bonds in trypsin-CRA-10991 are associated with a significantly higher pKa(f-OH), 9.29 (imparted by the ortho alkoxy group), than the pKa(f-OH) values of the other three 6-haloindoles (6.56, 8.72, and 8.74 for CRA-9850, CRA-11417, and CRA-10302, respectively). Unusual multi-centered short hydrogenbonding array, involving a water molecule on the S2 side of the inhibitor The pH dependence of the active site structure of the trypsin-6 ­chlorobenzimidazole complex, trypsin-CRA-10762 (Figure 5(c), #20), is dramatically

different from that of the indole counterpart, trypsin-CRA-10302 (Figure 5(c), #17) (described above). In trypsin-CRA-10762 multi-centered short hydrogen bond arrays involve intimate participation of the benzimidazole nitrogen at many pH values. Between pH 4.9 and 6.1, the short hydrogen bond array involves a water molecule, H2OS2, co-bound on the S2 side of the inhibitor benzimidazole plane (Figure 9), the side opposite from where H2Ooxy participates in the previously described (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) networks. Complexes in Ser195 which both the H2Ooxy- and H2OS2-mediated motifs coexist in one structure, such as trypsin-CRA-8696 (Figure 5(b), #10) (pH 5.7­ 6.3) have been described.2 Like the (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) short hydrogenSer195 bonding network, the (OS2, Og , Ophenol) one Ser195 involves a triangle of oxygen atoms. However, in the latter array the participating water, H2OS2, located between N12 His57 and Nbenzimidazole, forms a ° hydrogen bond with N12 His57 (2.73 A) and a very short hydrogen bond with Nbenzimidazole ° (2.14(^ 0.14) A at pH 5.7, Figure 9). In many structures of this type five out of the six hydrogen bonds involving the vertices of the approximate tetrahedron defined by OS2, Og , Ophenol and Ser195 Nbenzimidazole are short; in some structures all six are short (Table S1), and in many structures N12 ­ His57 ° H2OS2 is also short (, 2.4 A). In the (OS2, Og , Ser195 Ophenol) short hydrogen-bonding mode of trypsinCRA-10762, the phenol-distal phenyl dihedral (2 1168 at pH 5.7) differs substantially from that in the complexes with other hydrogen-bonding modes (2 64(^ 1)8) (Table S1), altering the van der Waals interactions between the distal phenyl and the His57 imidazole (Figure 9).

S10 -directed phenyl (Z group) breaks its C2 symmetry, thereby increasing the number of potential conformations. In one conformation the O group is above or near the oxyanion hole where it either interacts with or displaces H2Ooxy; in the other observed conformation it is directed toward S2. The O-substituted analogs (O ¼ NH2, F, or NO2) (Figure 5(d), #24, 26, 27) interact at or near the oxyanion hole of trypsin via the O group over the entire range of pH. Only in bound CRA-17312 (O ¼ OCH3, Figure 5(d), #25) is the O-group directed toward S2 (below pH 5.8 and above 7.2), or discretely disordered between locations on the S2 and oxyanion hole sides of the distal phenyl (5.9 , pH , 7.1). Three-centered (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) or fourSer195 centered (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol, Nbenzimidazole) short Ser195 hydrogen-bonding arrays are observed for the trypsin complexes of CRA-18607 (O ¼ NH2) at pH , 9.6, of CRA-17312 (O ¼ OCH3) at pH , 7.4, and of CRA-17693 (O ¼ F) at pH , 6.8 (Figure 5(d), #24 ­26). The active site hydrogen-bonding mode of trypsin-CRA-18306 (O ¼ NO2, Figure 5(d), #27) differs from that of the other complexes in Figure 5(d) in that it is two-centered (Og Ser195 ­Ophenol) over the whole pH range. One of the nitro oxygen atoms is near the oxyanion hole, accepting hydrogen bonds from Og Ser195 and from NGly193. The other nitro oxygen receives a long hydrogen bond from NGly193 (Figure 10(a)).

In trypsin-CRA-18607 (O ¼ NH2, Figure 5(d), #24) the O ¼ NH2 group displaces H2Ooxy and donates ordinary hydrogen bonds to Ooxy, OPhe41 and Ophenol. Between pH 6.8 and 8.3 an (OS2, Og , Ophenol) short hydrogen bond array (similar Ser195 to that in Figure 9) is in equilibrium with an (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) array (Figure 10(b)). Thus there are Ser195 a total of 18 hydrogen bonds partitioned between these two multi-centered motifs (Figure 10(b)). Unlike the active site-binding mode of trypsinCRA-8696, pH 5.7­ 6.3 (Figure 5(b), #10), which is interpreted as a fusion of co-existing H2Ooxy- and H2OS2-mediated arrays, involving only one Ser195 conformer,2 the analogous mode in trypsin-CRA18607 is interpreted as an equilibrium between these arrays, involving a corresponding equilibrium between alternate Ser195 conformers (Figure 10(b)). Modulation of stability of short hydrogen bond arrays at high pH by charged groups para to the phenol For several scaffolds (CRA-1144, CRA-7806, CRA-8696, CRA-9334, and CRA-9076) we investigated the effect on the pH dependence of active site hydrogen bond arrays of a monoanionic (acetate), or dianionic (succinate) group para to the phenol, directed into the solvent region (Figure 5(e)). The anionic group invariably destabilized

Note that logðKi Þ for CRA-15566 has been shifted by 1.0 unit to fit the entire curve on the graph with the current y-axis settings. (The low Ki of CRA-15566 is believed to be due to extreme low solubility.) The correlation between pH(min) and pKa ðf-OHÞ is apparent in the series, CRA-15566, CRA-8696, and CRA-14783.

the short hydrogen bond arrays at high pH. In trypsin-CRA-7806 (Figure 5(e), #28), the active site hydrogen bonds begin lengthening at higher pH (pH 9.7) than in the complex with the analog bearing the dianionic group, trypsin-CRA-16935
 For example, short hydrogen bond arrays persist in trypsin-CRA-9076 (Figure 5(e), #36) over the entire pH g ° range (Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol ¼ 2.37(^ 0.11) A; OSer195 ­ ° ; Ooxy ­ Ophenol ¼ 2.34(^0.11) A), ° Ooxy ¼ 2.34(^0.16) A whereas in the counterpart with an acetate para to the phenol (trypsin-CRA-9678, Figure 5(e), #35), lengthening to ordinary hydrogen bonds occurs at pH 6.0 until only ordinary hydrogen bonds remain at pH . 7.3 (Og Ser195 ­ ° ° Ophenol ¼ 2.78(^0.09) A; Og Ser195 ­ Ooxy ¼ 3.15(^ 0.09) A; ° Ooxy ­ Ophenol ¼ 2.65(^ 0.06) A). The dianionic succinate group para to the phenol in trypsin-CRA-19858 (Figure 5(e), #34) exerts an effect on the pH dependence of the active site hydrogen bond array of the parent, trypsinCRA-9076 (Figure 5(e), #36), similar to that of the monoanionic acetate group in trypsin-CRA-9678 (Figure 5(e), #35). Similar decreases in the stability of short hydrogen bond arrays are apparent in the comparison of trypsin-CRA-8696 (Figure 5(b), #10) versus the dianion counterpart (trypsin-CRA-20818, Figure 5(e), #31), or of trypsin-CRA-9334 (Figure 5(b), #7) versus trypsin-CRA16847 (Figure 5(e), #33), or of trypsin-CRA-1144 (Figure 5(a), #4) versus trypsin-CRA-18305 (Figure 5(e), #32).

(Figure 5(e), #30) (pH ¼ 8.9). In the latter complex there are no short hydrogen bonds above pH , 9.5 (Figure 5(e), #30), whereas in the parent there are two short hydrogen bonds in this range. For CRA-7806 we also examined the effect on the stability of the short hydrogen bond arrays of a cationic (ethylamine) group (in trypsin-CRA23653, Figure 5(e), #29) para to the phenol. Unlike the dianion-substituted inhibitor complex, the cation-substituted counterpart (Figure 5(e), #29) closely resembles the parent in its pH dependence of active site structure. At high pH there is even some marginal stability of the three-centered (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) short hydrogen bond array over Ser195 that of the parent. In the (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) array Ser195 (which is in equilibrium with the two-centered norhydrogen bond), all three mal, Og Ser195 ­Ophenol hydrogen bonds are short between pH , 9.7 and 10.1 in trypsin-CRA-23653, whereas in this range only two are short in the parent complex (trypsinCRA-7806, Figure 5(e), #28). A distinct increase in the high pH stability of the three-centered short hydrogen bond array in the complex with the cation-substituted inhibitor (trypsin-CRA-23653, Figure 5(e), #29) over that of the dianion-substituted one (trypsin-CRA-16935, Figure 5(e), #30) is apparent.

pH dependence of short hydrogen bondmediated inhibition indicates ionization of binding groups For short hydrogen bond-mediated inhibition by the scaffolds in Figure 1, ionization of the inhibitor phenol and of His57 accompanies binding and produces a pronounced pH dependence of inhibition for trypsin, uPA, thrombin, and factor Xa.1,2 Control compounds unable to support a negative charge on the inhibitor oxygen located at the active site, show little pH dependence of inhibition.1 Affinity is expected to decrease at high pH due to the unfavorable protonation of His57, and at low pH due to the unfavorable deprotonation of the inhibitor phenol. Simulations of the pH dependence of Ki, based on equilibrium concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor in such ionized states presumed necessary for short hydrogen bondmediated binding, closely resemble the actual curves.1 The pH dependencies of logðKi Þ toward trypsin and uPA for inhibitors that form short hydrogen bonds at the active site are shown in Figures 11 and 12, respectively. All inhibitors without the succinate group para to the phenol exhibit a similar, parabolic pH dependence of inhibition toward bovine trypsin (Figure 11) and uPA (Figure 12) over the pH range studied (5.0 ­10.0), with a welldefined minimum in Ki value (Ki(min)) character-

istic of each inhibitor. Benzimidazole inhibitors where R ¼ succinate exhibit a somewhat different pH dependence (Figure S1). The Ki(min) and associated pH(min) for bovine trypsin are listed in Table 1, along with the Ki values at pH 7.4 for human trypsin, thrombin, uPA, and factor Xa. For inhibition of bovine trypsin and uPA by inhibitors where R ­ succinate, there is a reasonable correlation of pH(min) with the pKa of the phenol of the unbound inhibitor (pKa(f-OH)) (Figure 13). The correlation of pH(min) with pKa(f-OH) supports ionization of the inhibitor phenol upon binding, required for short ionic hydrogen bond formation, as inferred from the structures of those complexes that exhibit short hydrogen-bonding motifs over the entire range of pH.

Discussion
Short, ionic hydrogen bonds at the active site and oxyanion hole The multi-centered short hydrogen bonds (Figure 2) are presumed ionic over a large range of pH, with a negative charge distributed (probably unequally) among Ophenol, Ooxy and Og , Ser195 and a positive charge on His57.1,2 The other short hydrogen-bonding motifs of this study are also believed to be ionic, like many other short hydrogen

bonds.31 ­ 34 They are located in a polar environment, where numerous additional ordinary hydrogen bonds extend the hydrogen-bonding network (Figures 1 and 2). The pKa values of the short hydrogen bond donor/acceptor groups (in their isolated states), ,14 for the serine hydroxyl, 15.7 for water,35 and 4.4­9.6 for the phenol hydroxyl, depending on the inhibitor (Table 1), differ significantly from one another. These features suggest that the short hydrogen bonds at the active site are essentially electrostatic and non-covalent1,2,12 ­ 14 unlike low-barrier hydrogen bonds with significant covalent character.9,10,36,37 Contribution of short hydrogen bonds to inhibitor binding While electrostatic hydrogen bonds (between charged groups) can dramatically enhance catalysis in a pre-organized polar environment,14 those of this study only moderately improve inhibitor binding. For example, the increase in free energy of binding to thrombin is only about 1.4 kcal/mol for the short hydrogen bond-forming phenol inhibitor, CRA-1144, over that of the pyridone isostere, CRA-10273.1 The same hydrogen bonds form at the active site of the pyridone and phenol complexes, but they are all ordinary ° (. 2.6 A)1 in the pyridone complex. As the pyridone oxygen cannot bear a formal negative charge, the associated hydrogen bonds are presumed less electrostatic than the short ones in thrombin-CRA1144. Removal of all protease­inhibitor active site hydrogen bonds, by replacement of the hydroxyl of CRA-1144 with a hydrogen atom, incurs a loss of only 1.3 kcal/mol binding energy toward factor Xa.3

In the present study numerous distinct short hydrogen bond networks were characterized crystallographically (Figure 5(a)) and enzymologically (Table 1). The structures and Ki values in this and other studies to evaluate the contribution of short hydrogen bonds to inhibitor binding1,2 demonstrate that no short hydrogen bond network in these systems imparts dramatic potency enhancement over alternate networks with typical length hydrogen bonds. Thus, despite their shortness, and the apparent linearity of the Og Ser195 ­Ophenol hydrogen bond (Figures 2, 8, and 15), these essentially electrostatic hydrogen bonds provide only a small fraction of the 10­ 20 kcal/mol binding energy claimed for covalent-like low-barrier hydrogen bonds proposed to accelerate some enzymatic reactions.9 Stabilization of short hydrogen bond arrays at high pH by increase in pKa(f-OH) Modulation of the pKa of the phenol hydroxyl (pKa(f-OH)) by an electron-withdrawing or donating group para to the phenol (directed toward the solvent) on a set of closely related simple, non-S10 directed inhibitors demonstrates that an increase in the basicity of the phenol hydroxyl can stabilize the short hydrogen bond motifs toward dissolution at high pH (Figure 6). For the simple benzimidazoles in Figure 5(a), dissolution involves deprotonation of His57, and disengagement of the inhibitor from the active site by a small pivot about the amidine, and a 1808 rotation about the benzimidazole ­phenol bond (Figure 3(b)), to produce the more stable internally hydrogenbonded inhibitor tautomer.1,2

Elaborate, Short H-bond Manifold at Active Site

The effect of an electron-donating methoxy group para to the phenol hydroxyl on more elaborated scaffolds that do not completely disengage from the active site at high pH can be seen in the comparison of the pH dependence of the structure of trypsin-CRA-8696 (Figure 5(b), #10) with that of trypsin-CRA-14783 (Figure 5(b), #11). The p-methoxy group in CRA-14783 incurs a shortening of the ordinary hydrogen bonds observed at some pH values in the parent complex. Only short hydrogen bonds are observed among Ooxy, Og Ser195 and Ophenol in trypsin-CRA-14783 over the entire pH range of determined structures, from 4.9 to 11.3. The short hydrogen bond-stabilizing effect of raising pKa(f-OH) may operate by decreasing the disparity among the pKa values of the three groups of the short hydrogen bond array (Ophenol, Og Ser195 and Ooxy). Equivalence or near equivalence of pKa values is reported to promote low-barrier short hydrogen bonds.9,10,36,37 However, modulation of pKa(f-OH) had insignificant effects on inhibitor potency. Stabilization of short hydrogen bond array at high pH by additional hydrogen bonds Short hydrogen bond arrays can also be stabilized by an inhibitor substituent that extends the hydrogen bonding array, even though the substituent may lower pKa(f-OH). Thus the threecentered (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) short hydrogen bond Ser195 array is stable to pH 9.2 in trypsin-CRA-18607 (Figure 5(d), #24) (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 7.1), in which the distal NH2 donates ordinary hydrogen bonds to Ooxy, Ophenol, and OPhe41 (Figure 10(b)), but only to pH 7.6 in the parent complex, trypsin-CRA-16935 (Figure 5(d), #28) (pKa(f-OH) ¼ 9.0). Long-range electrostatic interactions modulate active site hydrogen bonding The transition from a fully, short hydrogenbonded trypsin­ inhibitor complex to one where there are fewer or no short hydrogen bonds occurs at lower pH for analogs with an anionic group para to the phenol than for their parents. Thus the high pH limit for short hydrogen bond formation is only 7.2 for CRA-9678 (Figure 5(e), #35), whereas it is . 11 for the parent, CRA-9076 (Figure 5(e), #36). The generality of this effect is apparent from the predominance of active site motifs with only ordinary hydrogen bonds or with relatively few short hydrogen bonds at pH . 7 in complexes with an anionic group para to the inhibitor phenol (Figure 5(e), #30 ­ 35) (see footnote on page 107). Destabilization of short hydrogen bond arrays at high pH by an anionic group para to the phenol hydroxyl is thought to occur through long-range electrostatic interactions, as the group is directed toward the solvent, and does not interact appreciably with trypsin. Moreover, the active site structures of complexes with and without an anionic group (acetate or succinate) para to the phenol

adopt essentially identical active site-binding motifs, but in different pH ranges. Electrostatic potential (Delphi) calculations of the complex of the succinate-substituted compound (CRA-16935) versus that of the parent (trypsin-CRA-7806) predict an increase in pKa(f-OH) of the bound inhibitor, by about 0.9 unit, and a smaller increase in the pKa values of active site groups, Og , Ser195 H2Ooxy, and N12 , by about 0.6 units. Indeed, the His57 experimentally determined pKa(f-OH) of unbound CRA-16935 in solution (8.95 ^ 0.02) is 0.94 units higher than that of CRA-7806 (8.01 ^ 0.07) (Table 1). Many of the pH-induced transitions from a more active site-engaged to a less-engaged mode involve a movement of H2Ooxy out of the oxyanion hole with loss of the associated short hydrogen bonds. When H2Ooxy occupies the oxyanion hole it is presumed to have a reduced pKa, and anionic character,1 like hemiketal hydroxyl groups in tetrahedral intermediate mimetic complexes of trypsin and chymotrypsin.38 ­ 41 An increase in the pKa of H2Ooxy by long-range electrostatic interactions from the anionic group para to the phenol hydroxyl decreases the ionizability of the water, thereby stabilizing ordinary, non-ionic hydrogen bonds over short ionic ones. The lengthening of hydrogen bonds made by H2Ooxy results in its movement out of the oxyanion hole, where the pKa increases toward the unperturbed value of water. An anionic group para to the phenol hydroxyl and an electron-donating group para (or ortho) to it both raise pKa(f-OH), by through-space and through-bond mechanisms, respectively. However, the latter also raises the pKa values of other active site groups involved in short hydrogen bonds, Og Ser195 and H2Ooxy. Thus the latter substituent destabilizes short hydrogen bond arrays at high pH, whereas the former one stabilizes them. To further investigate the role of long-range electrostatic interactions on the high pH stability of short hydrogen bond arrays we synthesized an analog in which the anion was replaced with a cation (ethylamine) group (CRA-23653), and compared the pH dependence of its trypsin complex (Figure 5(e), #29) with that of the parent (Figure 5(e), #28), and with that of the para dianionic analog (Figure 5(e), #30). The three-centered (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) short hydrogen bond network in Ser195 the complex with the para cationic analog shows enhanced stability at high pH over that in the complex of the para dianionic analog. There are short hydrogen bonds in the former complex to pH . 10.9, while only to pH , 9.4 in the latter. There is also a region (pH , 9.7 ­ 10.1) in which there are three short hydrogen bonds in the complex with the para cationic analog (Figure 5(e), #29), while only two in the parent complex (Figure 5(e), #28). This modulation of the degree of short hydrogen bond interactions at the active site in the complexes involving the parent, the para dianionic and the para cationic analogs suggests

that long-range electrostatic interactions do indeed play a role in determining the active site hydrogen bonding motif. The dependence of active site hydrogen bonding motifs and associated hydrogen bond lengths on crystal form has also been attributed to long-range electrostatic interactions.2 Benzimidazole to indole substitutions increase basicity of phenol but decrease ionizability of heterocyclic nitrogen While benzimidazole to indole substitutions can promote short hydrogen bond formation by increasing pKa(f-OH), they can also exert an opposing effect by decreasing the ionizability of the heteroaryl N1 atom. The inhibitor nitrogen (N1) that often participates in the active site hydrogen bond arrays (Figure 1) is more basic in benzimidazoles than in indoles. Four-centered short hydrogen bond arrays, in which six short hydrogen bonds connect all pairs of atoms within the (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol, Nbenzimidazole) tetrahedron, Ser195 occur almost exclusively in benzimidazole complexes at low pH. Such arrays probably involve a positive or partial positive charge on protonated Nbenzimidazole, (and on protonated N12 ) and a His57 negative charge distributed among Ooxy, Ophenol and Og . Ser195 The effect of both raising pKa(f-OH) and changing the ionizability of this nitrogen can produce complex, often unexpected changes in the active site-binding mode, in its pH dependence, and in the lengths of the associated hydrogen bonds. Thus trypsin-CRA-7806 adopts multicentered short hydrogen bond motifs between pH 7.5 and 8.2 (Figure 5(b), #9), while the indole counterpart, trypsin-CRA-8696 displays only ordinary, two-centered, hydrogen bonds in this pH range (Figure 5(b), #10). Dependence of active site hydrogen bond motif on identity of protease The active site hydrogen bond arrays of thrombin-CRA-7806 (Figure 5(f), #37) and

thrombin-CRA-10655 (Figure 5(f), #38) are relatively pH-independent, unlike those of the corresponding trypsin complexes (Figure 5(b), #9 and 12). The multi-centered, H2Ooxy-mediated short hydrogen bond arrays remain intact to pH values as high as 11.4 in the thrombin complexes. The lack of H2Ooxy dissociation at high pH may reflect that H2Ooxy is bound directly in the relatively wide oxyanion hole of apo-thrombin but not in the smaller one of apo-trypsin.1 Comparison of the structures of the CRA-10655 complexes of thrombin (Figure 15(a)), trypsin (Figure 15(b)), and uPA (Figure 15(c)) show significant differences at the active site, most notably an N12 to ether oxygen hydrogen bond in the thromHis57 bin complex only. Because of subtle structural differences in the S1 and active site, this hydrogen bond is not formed in the trypsin complex (at any pH) or in the uPA complex (pH 6.5). The uPA complex is also unique in having an additional short ° hydrogen bond (2.43 A) at the active site, between the tightly bound, well-defined water molecules, H2Ooxy and H2Odistal (Figure 15(c)), extending the short hydrogen bond array. Finally, the significantly deeper S1 site of uPA results in different binding interactions at S1; the inhibitor amidine makes water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Asp189 in the uPA complex1,4 (as in uPA-CRA8696, Figure 7(a)), not direct ones, as in the trypsin and thrombin complexes. Significant differences in active site hydrogen bonding among uPA, trypsin and thrombin complexes occur, even when the amidine of a common inhibitor interacts directly with Asp189 at the S1 site in all cases. Thus, at comparable pH values, the N12 His57 to ether oxygen hydrogen bond (see Figure 15(a)) is absent in trypsin-CRA-11092, but present in the uPA counterpart, owing to the deeper S1 site in uPA. Similarly, H2Ooxy is cobound in all the thrombin complexes of this study at all pH values, presumably because of the wider oxyanion hole in thrombin, which accommodates H2Ooxy in the apo state.1 Therefore, the active sitebinding mode of inhibitors like CRA-10302 is three-centered, H2Ooxy-mediated in thrombin4 but two-centered in the trypsin and uPA complexes.

These comparisons demonstrate that distinct differences in the depth, width, and interrelationships of the S1 site, oxyanion hole, and active site constitute a unique signature of each protease that can markedly affect inhibitor-binding interactions and affinity even when the local sequences that form these sites are the same.42 Dramatic elevation of pKa of His57 in many of the protease­ inhibitor complexes The assignment of His57 as protonated in the (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) array and other short Ser195 hydrogen bond motifs is based on both crystallography and enzymology as a function of pH.1 For example, in trypsin-CRA-1802 (pH 4.5 ­ 9.7) there is a hydrogen bond between N12 and His57 12 ° Og Ser195 (2.91 ^ 0.09 A) and between NHis57 and ° Ophenol (2.69 ^ 0.02 A) (Figure 2). If N12 His57 were unprotonated it would have to accept hydrogen bonds from Og Ser195 and from protonated Ophenol. However, the Og Ser195 proton (or, alternatively a proton associated with Ophenol) is not available for donation to N12 , as it is required for the (Ooxy, His57 Og , Ophenol) short hydrogen bond network. Ser195 Further evidence for protonated His57 in such complexes is presented below. In thrombin-CRA-10655, N12 His57 donates hydro° (2.91 ^ 0.08 A) and to Ophenol gen bonds to Og Ser195 ° ) at pH values as high as 11.0 (Figure (2.56 ^ 0.07 A 15(a), Table S1). These hydrogen bonds also occur in trypsin-CRA-10655, pH , 7.0 (Figure 15(b)) and in uPA-CRA-10655, pH 6.5 (Figure 15(c)). However, in the thrombin complex the unique hydrogen to the ether oxygen bond from N12 His57 ° (2.91 ^ 0.18 A), of unambiguous directionality, provides a further constraint establishing that N12 His57 is protonated in the three-centered (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) short hydrogen bond array, even at Ser195 pH 11 (Figure 15(a)). In the thrombin complexes at very high pH it appears that deprotonation of His57 begins to occur, but from Nd1, not from N12; in thrombin-CRA-7806 there is a significant (9.0s) increase in the length of the Nd1 ­Od2 His57 Asp102 hydro° gen bond, from 2.94(^ 0.02) A in the structures at ° lower pH, to 3.14 A at pH 11.4. A final indication of the protonation state of His57 in thrombin-CRA-10655 is the relatively ° short N12 ­ Ophenol distance, 2.57 A at pH 11.0, sigHis57 nifying an additional short ionic hydrogen bond between protonated, positively charged His57 and the phenolate. Likewise, in some of the trypsin complexes, N12 ­ Ophenol hydrogen bonds (Figure His57 ° 8) as short as 2.50 A were observed at pH values as high as 10.9 (Table S1). Elevation of pKa(His57) is presumed in all protease complexes that exhibit three-centered (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) short ionic Ser195 hydrogen bond arrays at high pH. It can be inferred that the accompanying N12 ­ Ophenol His57 hydrogen bond is also ionic, regardless of whether or not it is short, with N12 acting as the donor His57 (Figures 2 and 14). Two-centered (Og Ser195 ­Ophenol) short hydrogen

bond motifs are also believed to be ionic, especially when they are accompanied by short N12 ­Ophenol His57 hydrogen bonds (Figure 8). In most two-centered (Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol) hydrogen bond motifs (both ordinary and short), Og Ser195 is either directed toward the oxyanion hole (Figure 8), or right in it (Figure 14), accepting hydrogen bonds from NGly193 and NSer195. The NSer195 ­ Og Ser195 hydrogen bond in many of ° these motifs is often short, as short as 2.45 A. A partially ionized character for Og Ser195 and a distribution of a negative charge between Og Ser195 and Ophenol is possible for both short and ordinary twocentered (Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol) hydrogen bonds. In this ionized state the negative charge would be neutralized by donation of an ionic hydrogen bond to Ophenol from protonated N12 , and by donation of His57 hydrogen bonds to Og Ser195 from NGly193 and from NSer195. Ionization is also implicated by the parabolic pH dependence of log Ki for inhibitors (such as CRA-10991 and CRA-10302) that form hydrogen bonds two-centered, Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol (either short or ordinary) in the trypsin complexes over the entire pH range (Figure 11). The dependence is similar to that for inhibitors that form multi-centered short ionic hydrogen bond arrays. Elevation of the pKa of His57 during serine protease catalysis has been deduced from studies of tetrahedral adducts (transition state analogs) of trypsin, d-chymotrypsin,38 ­ 40 and subtilisin.43,44 Elevated pKa values of His57 (measured by NMR) greater than ten,38 greater than 11,39 or as high as 12,41,45 were attributed to the negative charge of the oxyanion. A feature of such zwitterionic tetrahedral transition state analog adducts is the concurrent raising of pKa(His57) and lowering of the pKa of the inhibitor oxygen in the oxyanion hole.14,39,43 ­ 45 Likewise, elevation of pKa(His57) in many of the serine protease­inhibitor complexes of this study appears to result from hydrogen bonding of N12 to both Og His57 Ser195 and Ophenol of the negatively charged (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) triad in Ser195 the H2Ooxy-mediated, multi-centered short hydrogen bond arrays, or to the negatively charged Ophenol of the two-centered (Og Ser195 ­ Ophenol) short hydrogen bond. Effect of unique electronic properties of 6-chlorobenzimidazole on pH dependence of bound structure The pH dependencies of the structures of trypsin complexes of four isosteres, involving 6-chloro and 6-fluoro substituents on benzimidazole and indole scaffolds (Figure 5(c), #17 ­20), shows a greater diversity in the active site hydrogen bond modes for the 6-halobenzimidazole complexes (Figure 5(c), #19, 20) than for the corresponding 6-haloindole counterparts (Figure 5(c), #17, 18). While the 6-halobenzimidazole complexes exhibit multicentered short hydrogens bond arrays, either H2OS2- or H2Ooxy-mediated at many pH values, the corresponding 6-haloindole complexes adopt

almost exclusively two-centered, Og Ser195 ­Ophenol hydrogen bonds, either short or ordinary. For the 6-halobenzimidazole complexes, replacement of 6-fluoro (in trypsin-CRA-10818, Figure 5(c), #19) with 6-chloro (in trypsin-CRA-10762, Figure 5(c), #20) extends the pH range of the three-centered (OS2, Og , Ophenol), short hydrogen Ser195 bond array. This motif is stable at full occupancy to pH 6.2 in the 6-chlorobenzimidazole complex, but only to pH 5.4 in the 6-fluoro complex, where it coexists with the (Ooxy, Og , Ophenol) array. This Ser195 stability difference may reflect a change in the charge distribution on the benzimidazole nitrogen atoms of the bound inhibitor. Both the 6-fluoro and 6-chloro can withdraw electrons by induction from the nitrogen (N1) involved in the active site hydrogen bond motifs, but only the 6-chloro group can also donate electrons by resonance to the carbon adjacent to N3 (Figure 4(b2)). Such

polarization of the 6-chlorobenzimidazole involving a partial positive charge on the nitrogen participating in active site hydrogen bonding (Figure 4(b2), H) is expected to stabilize short, ionic hydrogen bonds involving this nitrogen. For another 6-chlorobenzimidazole complex (trypsin-CRA-10972, Figure 5(c), #23), the pH range of the (OS2, Og , Ophenol) short hydrogen Ser195 bond array, either alone or in equilibrium with the (Ooxy Og , Ophenol) array (pH 4.9­ 7.3) is also conSer195 siderably greater than for the 6-fluoro counterpart (trypsin-CRA-10950, Figure 5(c), #22) (pH 7.6 ­8.4). The 6-fluoro to chloro substitutions, in isosteric scaffolds with similar S1-binding modes, show that electronic perturbations incurred by seemingly minor substitutions somewhat distal to the active site can significantly affect the active site-binding mode.

Structural basis for affinity enhancement of 6-haloindoles over 6-halobenzimidazole isosteres Replacement of the benzimidazole of CRA-1144, with the indole of CRA-8328 results in enhancement in potency towards uPA, trypsin and factor Xa by 4.1, 3.3 and 2.8-fold, respectively, at pH values where the differences are maximal.1 Similarly, potency enhancements toward trypsin of 3.4, 6.7, 5.9, and 8.1-fold (at respective pH(min) values) were observed for benzimidazole to indole replacements in more elaborated scaffolds, CRA-9076/CRA-9334, CRA-8696/CRA-7806, CRA19858/CRA-16847, and CRA-10302/CRA-10762, respectively (Table 1). The decrease in potency of the benzimidazoles reflects an unfavorable conformational change required to convert the lowest energy benzimidazole tautomer (Figure 4(a), A and B) to the binding conformer (Figure 4(a), C). However, the indole isostere, with only one possible internal hydrogen bond possible, is locked into the binding conformation.1,2 For many serine proteases, a significant increase in affinity enhancement resulting from benzimidazole to indole replacements was noted for 6-halo analogs over non-halo counterparts.4 For example the potency enhancement toward uPA is much larger (73-fold) for conversion of the 6-chlorobenzimidazole, CRA-10762, to the 6-chloroindole isostere, CRA-10302, than for conversion of the non-halo benzimidazole, CRA-7806, to the nonhaloindole isostere, CRA-8696 (6.3-fold) (Table 1). The affinity amplification of indole over benzimidazole scaffolds incurred by the 6-chloro group is thought to occur through resonant donation of electrons by the chloro to the carbon adjacent to N3 and through withdrawal of electrons by induction from N1 of the benzimidazole (Figure 4(b1)). These electronic effects stabilize the non-binding conformation of the 6-chlorobenzimidazole (Figure 4(b1), D and E) over its binding conformation (Figure 4(b1), F) to a greater extent than for the non-halo counterpart (Figure 4(a)). They are also compatible with involvement of Nbenzimidazole in the multi-centered short hydrogen bond network in trypsin-CRA10762 at many pH values (Figure 5(c), #20), and the lack of involvement of Nindole in the indole counterpart (trypsin-CRA-10302) at any pH (Figure 5(c), #17, Table S1). Cooperativity of S1, S10 and active site binding elements in determining bound inhibitor structure and selectivity One of the challenging aspects of structure-based design is the high frequency at which a small change in the inhibitor results in a large change in binding, necessitating structural determination of complexes of even closely related inhibitor analogs to reliably interpret associated Ki data. This

principle is evident in many crystal structure comparisons of this and other studies,1 ­ 2,4,42 in which a one-atom substitution at the 6 position, ortho to the amidine, can markedly alter the position and orientation of the bound inhibitor and the hydrogen bonding both at the S1 and active sites.4 Such analogs usually bind deeper in the S1 site, displacing a water molecule (H2O1S1) (Figure 7), thereby imparting great selectivity toward Ser190 proteases over Ala190 counterparts, because of the resulting hydrogen bonding deficit of the inhibitor amidine in the Ala190 proteases.4,5 Whether or not this water molecule is displaced from the S1 site of uPA depends critically, not only on the size of the 6-halo, but also on more distal interactions, such as those at S10 .4 The structures of this study underscore that a subtle change in either the S1 or S10 substituent and associated binding interactions, or in the electronic character of the inhibitor scaffold, is often accompanied by a dramatic change in active site hydrogen bonding and in its pH dependence. Similarly, subtle changes in the dimensions and interrelationships of the S1, S10 and active sites among different members of the serine protease family can lead to conspicuous differences in interactions at these sites when the homologs are bound by a common active site-directed, short hydrogen bond-forming inhibitor (Figure 15). These coupled structural parameters in turn dictate the specificity profile of the inhibitor.

Concluding Remarks
An extensive structural manifold of protease­ inhibitor active site hydrogen bond arrays has been revealed in several hundred crystal structures at multiple pH values involving three different proteases and a large suite of short hydrogen bond-forming inhibitors. Examination of the pH dependence of the active site hydrogen-bonding motifs and associated hydrogen bond lengths not only provides insight into ionization events coincident with inhibitor binding but also affords visualizations of protein structures at extremes of pH. The integration of water into hydrogen bond networks, by co-binding either in the oxyanion hole or on the S2 side of the inhibitor, yields a vast repertoire of active site motifs. Likewise, displacement of water normally bound at the S1 site, incurred by deeper binding of 6-halo inhibitors, amplifies the diversity of hydrogen bond arrays, both short and ordinary at the active site. The nature of these arrays is modulated by both short and long-range steric interactions, or by the pKa of the inhibitor phenol, either by through-space electrostatics or by through-bond resonance and electronic induction. While the short hydrogen bonds do not provide enormous additional affinity over ordinary counterparts, the associated scaffolds are well-suited for exploiting subtle variations in the dimensions and interrelationships of

the active site, oxyanion hole, S1 and S10 sites in remarkably small, conformationally restrained scaffolds. Thus, structure-based design that harnesses the short hydrogen bond-mediated inhibition paradigm has expedited development of potent selective inhibitors of uPA, factor Xa and factor VIIa, and no doubt will open rapid discovery routes to effective inhibitors of other serine protease drug targets.

Solutions were buffered with 100 mM potassium acetate, Mes, Tris or 50 mM Caps, contained 2.5% (v/v) DMSO, 1.0 mM CaCl2, and were saturated in inhibitor. The soaking solutions for the large cell P212121 form also contained 10 mg/ml trypsin. The pH of the soaking solutions for trypsin and thrombin complexes was monitored before, during and after data collection. Crystallographic data collection X-ray diffraction data-sets were collected at room temperature with an R-AXIS IV image plate using Cu Ka radiation focused with Yale/MSC mirrors, filtered with 0.001 inch of nickel foil, or with an R-AXIS IVþ þ image plate with Osmic mirrors. X-rays were generated with Rigaku RU200 or RUH3R generators equipped with rotating copper anode target tubes operating at 46 ­ 55 kV, 90 ­100 mA. The image plates, mirrors, and data reduction software were from Molecular Structure Corporation (MSC), The Woodlands, TX. Crystal-to-detector distances ranged from 71.0 mm to 125.0 mm, u was 0.08 and oscillations were 1.28­ 3.08 in w (R-AXIS IV; data reduced with Biotex) or 0.58 (R-AXIS IVþ þ ; data reduced with Crystal Clear). Exposure times were typically 18­ 20 min/deg (R-AXIS IV) or 4 ­ 8 min/deg (R-AXIS IVþ þ ). The completeness of each dataset, before rejection of weak reflections (I/s , 0.5­ 1.0 using Biotex; no I/s cutoff using Crystal Clear) was . 98.5% for trypsin crystals and . 96% for the lower symmetry thrombin and uPA crystals. Refinement of structures Initial structures of trypsin, thrombin, and uPA complexes were determined and refined as described1,42 and refined with X-PLOR47,48 and with difference Fourier analysis. In ðlFo l 2 lFc lÞ; ac maps, positive and negative peaks with magnitudes greater than 2.8s were systematically identified and analyzed. Water structure was determined from density peaks greater than 2.8s in ðlFo l 2 lFc lÞ; ac maps that coincided with density in ð2lFo l 2 lFc lÞ; ac maps at stereochemically reasonable locations. Following refinement all water molecules ° whose temperature factors exceeded 50 A2 were inspected and adjusted where necessary based on the density and environment. All heavy and hydrogen atoms were included in the refinements. Force field terms among groups involved in short hydrogen bonds were removed. Data collection and refinement statistics and RCSB PDB codes for a subset of ten structures are given in Table 2. RCSB PDB codes, R-factors and resolutions for a subset of 64 structures comprising all the short hydrogen bond motifs listed in the legend to Figure 5, are listed in Table 3.

methods (Table 1). The pKa values were normally determined in triplicate on each batch of each water-soluble sample. For potentiometric determinations of pKa values of less water-soluble compounds, apparent pKa values were determined in an aqueous (0.15 M KCl)/organic co-solvent system at three ratios of organic co-solvent/ aqueous solution. For dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) cosolvent, typical limits were from 24% to 37% by weight, and for methanol typical limits were from 24% to 50% by weight. The aqueous pKa was determined by extrapolation to 0% organic co-solvent. Calculations of differences in electrostatic potential Difference electrostatic potential maps were calculated and visualized with Delphi52 licensed from Accelrys. Solvent and solute dielectric constants of 80 and 2.0, respectively, were used. Predicted shifts in pKa values were calculated with the formula DpKa ¼ gi ðDwÞ=2:303; where Dw is the average change in electrostatic potential at the ionizable groups, and gi ¼ 21; or þ 1 for an acidic or basic group, respectively.52 Charges of 1.0 and 0.33 were assigned to Lys and Arg side-chain nitrogen atoms, and of 20.50 to Glu and Asp side-chain oxygen atoms. In addition charges of 0.50 (amidine nitrogen atoms), 20.33 (Ophenol, Og , Ooxy), 1.00 (N12 ), 2 0.50 Ser195 His57 (inhibitor carboxylate oxygen atoms) and 1.0 (amine nitrogen of CRA-23653) were used. Enzyme assays Bovine trypsin and high molecular weight uPA (HMW uPA) were obtained from Worthington Biochemicals and American Diagnostica, respectively. The trypsin substrate, tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA, was from Sigma, and the HMW uPA substrate, MeOC-Nle-Gly-Arg-pNA was from Centerchem, Inc. Inhibition constants were determined as described.1,42 All inhibitor potency and enzyme activity measurements were performed at room temperature in 50 mM Mes, Tris, or Caps (pH 5 ­ 6, 7 ­ 9, and 10, respectively), 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA and 2.5% DMSO in 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon) using a Thermomax-Kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices). Trypsin concentrations were 50 nM (pH 5.0), 10 nM (pH 6.0­ 8.0), or 20 nM (pH 9.0­ 10.0), and HMW uPA concen-

trations were 200 nM (pH 5.0), 100 nM (pH 6.0), or 30 nM (pH 7.0 ­ 10.0). In these assays as a function of pH the DMSO concentration (2.5%) is the same as that used for crystallography, whereas in more standard assays at pH 7.4 (last four columns of Table 1) the DMSO concentration is 10.0%. A higher DMSO concentration increases inhibitor solubility, and consequently decreases inhibitor potency, in general.The enzyme kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) were determined at each pH by direct nonlinear fit to the Michaelis ­ Menten equation. Most inhibition determinations were performed at a substrate concentration equal to the Km. Apparent inhibition constants, Ki0 values, were calculated from the substrate hydrolysis data collected at various inhibitor concentrations with the software package BatchKi (developed and provided by Dr Petr Kuzmic, BioKin Ltd, Pullman, WA), using methodology similar to that described for tight-binding inhibitors.53 Ki0 values were converted to Ki values by the transformation, Ki ¼ K0i =ð1 þ ½S=Km Þ: Some Ki values, indicated in bold in Table 1, were determined rigorously by varying both the substrate and inhibitor concentrations, as described.1,42

The p-fluoro in CRA-1802, p-trifluoromethoxy in CRA-9785, and p-chloro in CRA-11111 reduce pKa(f-OH) through induction by 0.35, 0.40 and 0.87, from the values in the respective parents (CRA-1144, CRA-1144 (pKa ¼ 8.23) and CRA-8696 (pKa ¼ 8.76)), while the p-nitro group in CRA-8249 and CRA-15566 incurs more dramatic decreases, of 3.80 and 3.71, from the values for the parents, CRA-1144 and CRA-8696, respectively, through resonance delocalization of negative charge onto the nitro oxygens. The pKa of the phenol hydroxyl is also decreased by replacing the indole (as in CRA8328, pKa(f-OH) ¼ 9.10) with the isosteric, more electron withdrawing benzimidazole (as in CRA1144, pKa(f-OH) ¼ 8.23), or by replacing the phenol (as in CRA-1144) with the isosteric hydroxypyridine (as in CRA-1801, pKa(f-OH) ¼ 7.69). Incorporation of a bromo ortho to the phenol also dramatically decreases pKa(f-OH) (by 1.44 and 1.84 for CRA-9334 and CRA-9076, respectively) but, as the bromo is directed toward S10 , the effect on the structure of the complex is probably not purely electronic. The electron-donating p-methoxy group in CRA6669, CRA-14783 and CRA-11260 modestly increases pKa(f-OH) (by 0.23, 0.25, and 0.11) over
 Both CRA-9334 and CRA-9076 differ from CRA-1144 and CRA-8328, respectively, by a methyl para to the hydroxyl as well as by a bromo ortho to it. The calculated effect on pKa(f-OH) of the methyl (0.16) was evaluated from the CRA-8696/CRA-9075 comparison.

that of the parents (CRA-1144, CRA-8696 and CRA-10302, respectively), while the o-alkoxy in CRA-10433 exerts a more substantial increase (0.46) over that of the parent (CRA-8328, pKa ¼ 9.10). An o-phenyl group modestly decreases pKa(f-OH), by 0.22 and 0.38 for CRA7806 and CRA-8696 (compared to CRA-1144 and CRA-8328, respectively), due to resonance delocalization of the negative charge of the phenolate onto a more conjugated scaffold. A further dramatic decrease in pKa(f-OH), by 1.8 units, can be effected by incorporation of a hydrogen bond donor, such as the NH2 group in CRA18607, at the ortho position of the distal phenyl of the CRA-16935 parent. The decrease is believed to reflect stabilization of the phenolate by an internal hydrogen bond between the distal NH2 group and Ophenol (in the modeled, most favorable solution conformer as well as in the observed trypsinbound structure), in addition to stabilization by the Nbenzimidazole-Ophenol hydrogen bond (Figure 1). Other hydrogen bond-donating groups at the ortho position of the distal phenyl were found to incur a similar, sizable decrease in pKa(f-OH). A dianionic (succinate) group para to the phenol of the CRA-7806 scaffold raises pKa(f-OH) from 8.01(^ 0.09) to 8.95(^ 0.02), presumably from through-space electrostatic interactions. The succinate group was found to also dramatically raise the pKa of the benzimidazole nitrogen from 3.73 in CRA-1144 to 5.74 in the dianion analog, CRA18305. (The pKa value for the benzimidazole nitrogen is apparent in many but not all pKa determinations involving benzimidazoles.) Edited by I.

 However, the dianionic group did not raise pKa(fOH) when introduced into the CRA-9334 and CRA-9076 scaffolds (Table 1).
