Shape complementarity is a fundamental principle of inhibitor design. Here we show that an enzyme for which the crystal structure has been determined (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, PNMT) conceals a cryptic binding site. This site is revealed upon binding of inhibitors that are double the size of the physiological substrate. These large inhibitors are not predicted to bind in that they protrude through the accessible surface calculated from a PNMT/7-aminosulfonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (SK&F 29661) crystal structure, yet they are potent inhibitors of PNMT. We determined structures of the enzyme complexed with large inhibitors and found that the volume of the active site increases by 140 Å3 upon binding. Changes in active site size and shape are brought about by unfavorable side chain conformations and rigid body helix motions. The energetic cost is modest, estimated at 2-3 kcal/mol from mutational analyses. Our findings further underline the importance of protein flexibility in structure-based inhibitor design studies.
Introduction Inhibition of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMTa) is a means of blocking the production of epinephrine (adrenaline) in the central nervous system and thereby enabling the elucidation of the role of epinephrine as a neurotransmitter. Toward this end, we aim to develop inhibitors of human PNMT (hPNMT) that are potent and selective and that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The crystal structure of hPNMT has previously been determined in complex with the inhibitor, 7-aminosulfonyl-1,2,3,4tetrahydroisoquinoline (SK&F 29661, 1), and the cofactor product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy).1 The structure revealed that 1 did not fully utilize the available space in the active-site cavity and suggested there was room for additional substituents at both the 3- and 7-positions (Figure 1) of the tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) ring. A series of 3- and 7-substituted THIQ inhibitors (Table 1) had previously been shown to have increased affinity for hPNMT compared with 1 (Ki value 120 nM, Table 1).2 Surprisingly, THIQ inhibitors with 7-substituents that are seemingly too large for the hPNMT binding pocket (5-9, Table 1) retained significant enzyme inhibitory

activity. For example, the PNMT inhibitor 8 has a p-chlorophenylsulfonamide substituent at the 7-position of the THIQ ring, yet racemic 8 inhibits hPNMT with a Ki value of 39 nM (Table 1). Clearly, if this ligand binds to the same hPNMT binding site as smaller 7-substituted THIQ compounds such as 1, the binding pocket must adapt to accommodate the larger substituent. Furthermore, these substituents must make interactions of sufficient strength to offset the energetic cost of these adaptations. We investigated how hPNMT accommodates 7-substituted and 3,7-disubstituted THIQ inhibitors by using X-ray crystallography. The resulting crystal structures show that the enzyme adapts to the presence of large 7-substituents through side chain conformational changes, involving primarily Lys57, as well as

a rigid body movement of an active site helix by 0.5 Å or more and perturbation of a second active site helix. Together these changes increase the volume of the binding pocket by 140 Å3 at an energetic cost estimated from mutational analysis to be 2-3 kcal/mol. Results The crystal structures of wt hPNMT/AdoHcy with 5 or 6 and of wt hPNMT/AdoMet with 4 or 7 were solved at a resolution of 2.6, 2.2, 2.4, and 2.0 Å, respectively. We also solved the structures of K57A hPNMT/AdoHcy with 5, 7, or 8 at a resolution of 2.8, 2.8, and 2.3 Å, respectively. The statistics for the refined crystal structures are given in Table 2. The structure determination of hPNMT/AdoHcy/8 is reported in detail elsewhere (pdb accession code 2G8N).3 In brief, the diffraction data for the hPNMT/AdoHcy/8 complex were measured to a resolution limit of 2.15 Å, and the structure was refined with R-factor and R-free values of 20.0 and 24.2%, respectively. The crystal structures are isomorphous with previously published structures of hPNMT in complex with 1, octopamine, 7-iodo-, or 7,8-dichloro-substituted THIQ.1,4-6 The secondary structure and most of the tertiary structure of the enzyme in the structures of the complexes reported here are essentially identical to those described previously. The binding mode and contacts formed to the cofactor product AdoHcy are also consistent with those reported earlier,1,4-6 and the AdoMet cofactor in the complexes with 4 and 7 is bound as predicted by modeling.5 7-p-Chlorophenyl Substituent Induces Disorder in Lys57. Inhibitor 5 has a bulky p-chlorophenyl substituent on the 7-sulfonamide group of the THIQ nucleus but no 3-substituent (Table 1). The addition of the p-chlorophenyl in the absence of a 3-substituent is unfavorable; thus, the Ki value for 5 is higher than that for 1 and much higher than that for 8 or 9, which have the same 7-substituent in addition to a substituent at the

3-position (Table 1). The crystallization and crystal structure of hPNMT complexed with 5 supports this interpretation. Crystals of the hPNMT/5 complex took 3-4 weeks to grow, in contrast to the 3-4 days needed for the other enzyme/inhibitor complexes to crystallize. Electron density corresponding to 5 was present in only one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit and was poorly ordered for the p-chlorophenyl group (Figure 2B, Supporting Information, Figure 1). Furthermore, electron density was absent for much of the side chain of the critical active site residue Lys57, and these atoms were built with zero occupancy to indicate that their position is not defined. The poor density for Lys57 suggests that the p-chlorophenyl substituent induces disorder in this residue (Figure 2B). Lys57 was identified previously as important for substrate and inhibitor recognition,1,5,6 and its flexible side chain was found to move within the active site to accommodate different inhibitor substituents.4 In previously determined structures, the Lys57 side chain amine interacts with a water or an inhibitor sulfonamide.1,4 The disordered nature of Lys57 in the crystal structure of hPNMT complexed with 5 is probably a consequence of the lack of a binding partner for this buried charged residue. Major Perturbations of the Active Site to Accommodate 3,7-Disubstituted THIQs. Inhibitor 8 has the same chemical structure as 5 but with the addition of a 3-hydroxymethyl substituent (Table 1). The combination of the p-chlorophenyl group, and the 3-substituent in 8 is favorable for binding to hPNMT. Thus, the Ki value for racemic 8 is lower than that for 5 (which lacks the 3-substituent) and also lower than that for 1 (which lacks both the 3-substituent and the p-chlorophenyl moiety; Table 1). Unlike that for 5, the electron density for 8 is well-ordered.3 The structure reveals significant changes for the side chain conformations of Lys57 and Cys60 (Figures 2C and 3G). Lys57 adopts a conformation very different to that observed previously (Figure 3G compared with 3A,B). The probability

of the new conformation is low, estimated at 0.05%,7 compared with 4% for the previously reported rotamer of Lys57 in hPNMT. In the new conformation, the side chain of Lys57 interacts with one of two alternate conformations modeled for the side chain of Cys60 (Figures 2C and 3G). The conformation of the side chain of Cys60 that interacts with Lys57 is also altered compared with those observed in previous structures (Figure 3G compared with 3A,B). The new conformation of the Cys60 side chain, with a 1 value of 116°, is neither in an extended (180°) nor gauche (-) (60°) conformation, but is instead oriented in an unfavorable or low probability conformation of close to 120°. In contrast, the previously observed conformation for the Cys60 side chain has a 1 value of -65°, close to ideal for a low-energy gauche (+) rotamer. The probability for this previously observed conformation is 57%.7 In addition to the side chain conformational changes, there is a rigid body displacement of 0.5-0.7 Å by the part of the active site helix R3 that incorporates Lys57 and Cys60 (Figure 3I) in comparison to the structures complexed with inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 that have much smaller 7-substituents. There is also a perturbation of the first turn of helix R4 and a rotation of the side chain of Tyr126 (located on the R4 helix) away from the active site (Figure 3J) upon binding 8. The Tyr126 side chain, which forms a water-mediated interaction with the Arg44

mainchain oxygen in the hPNMT/1 complex (Figure 3A), instead forms a hydrogen bond to the mainchain oxygen of Tyr40 in the complex with 8 (not shown). These same perturbations to Lys57, Cys60, Tyr126, R3, and R4 are also observed in hPNMT upon binding 7 (Figure 3F,I,J). This inhibitor, like 8, has both a 3-substituent and a bulky substituent on the 7-sulfonamide THIQ framework. Conversely, when a flexible aliphatic chain is substituted in this position, as in 6, or the 3-substituent is lacking, as in 5, we only observe the changes to Tyr126 and R4 (Figure 3I,J), suggesting that it is the combination of the 3-substituent and the bulky 7-substituent that induces the major conformational effects in hPNMT. However, to rule out any direct effect of the 3-substituent in causing the conformational changes at R3, we determined the structure of hPNMT in complex with 4. This inhibitor has a small 7-nitro substituent on the THIQ nucleus, like that of 2, and in addition has a 3-hydroxymethyl substituent, like that of 8. As expected, the enzyme in the structure with 4 had none of the perturbations described above for Lys57, Cys60, Tyr126, R3, or R4. This confirms that a combination of a bulky 7-substituent and a 3-substituent is required to induce the changes in the enzyme active site architecture. Collectively, the side chain and mainchain movements described above increase the volume of the inhibitor binding

pocket compared with the originally described hPNMT structures (from 450 Å3 for 1 to 520 Å3 for 6 and 590 Å3 for 7 and 8, Figure 4). This increase in volume is apparently due to the changes that occur at Lys57. In the K57A mutant structures with 5, 7, and 8 bound (see below), the volume of the active site is calculated to be 610 Å3 (Figure 4D). Effect of 3- and 7-Substituents on Inhibitor Binding. Superimposition of the bound conformations of inhibitors 4-8 with that of 1 (representing the simplest inhibitor) allows comparison of their binding position and orientation within the enzyme active site. All four compounds that have 3-substituents (4, 6, 7, and 8) are rotated by 10-15° about the long axis of the THIQ framework compared with 1, to allow optimal binding interactions of the 3-substituent (Figure 5A,C,D). This rotation is not observed for 5, which lacks a 3-substituent (Figure 5B). Instead, 5 is translated in the binding site by 0.5-0.6 Å in the direction of the THIQ 3-position compared with 1, presumably to enable the binding of the bulky 7-substituent in the sterically restricted binding site. Notably, the distance that 5 is translated in the active site (to the right in Figure 5) is the same magnitude as the rigid body movement of R3 (to the left in Figure 5) when 7 or 8 are bound. We surmise that the bulky 7-substituents of 5, 7, and 8 require additional binding volume at the active site compared with 1. An increase in binding volume is achieved rather inadequately for 5 (given the poor binding of this inhibitor) by the 0.5-0.6 Å shift of the inhibitor in the active site. The presence of a 3-substituent in 7 and 8 prevents such a shift because of the additional steric bulk. Instead, it is the enzyme that adapts to increase the binding volume for the 7-substituent. It does so by the rigid body motion of helix R3 and by side chain conformational changes to Lys57 and Cys60.

Molecular Basis for the Binding Potency of 7-Sulfonamide Substituents. In the enlarged active site of hPNMT, favorable interactions that were not possible in the previously described structures are observed to occur between the enzyme and the bulky 7-substitutents of 7 and 8. The aromatic substituent of 8 forms edge-face interactions with the side chain of Tyr40 and the p-chloro group fits into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the sidechains of Leu58, Tyr85, Tyr126, and Gly54 and the aliphatic chain of Lys57. This binding interaction provides the molecular basis for the observation that a p-substituent, but not a m-substituent, increases the activity of this series of inhibitors.8 In the structure of hPNMT complexed with 1, Lys57 interacts with the sulfonamide of the inhibitor (Figure 3A). However, when 8 is bound and Lys57 adopts a new conformation, the sulfonamide rotates so that it is within the hydrogen bond distance of the Asn39 mainchain oxygen (Figure 3G). This interaction contributes significantly to inhibitor binding, because replacement of the sulfonamide with a sulfone reduces binding potency.3 The p-chlorophenyl of 5 is similarly placed to that of 8 (Figure 5D) though the disordered electron density of the p-chlorophenyl suggests weaker binding for 5. This is confirmed by B-factor analysis of 5 and 8. In the structure of hPNMT/8, the average B-factor for the inhibitor (42 Å2) is lower than the value for all protein atoms (51 Å2), suggesting that it is tightly bound and well-ordered. In contrast, the average B-factor for 5 is higher (78 Å2) than that for protein atoms (69 Å2), indicating that it is bound more weakly and poorly ordered. However, when Lys57 is mutated to Ala in the K57A hPNMT structures, the B-values for 5 (57 Å2) are lower than for protein (65 Å2), as is the case for 8 (45 Å2 and 58 Å2, respectively, for inhibitor and protein B values). This suggests that it is the interplay between Lys57 and 5 that induces the disorder observed in both. The aliphatic thiomorpholino group of 7 interacts with the same residues as the p-chlorophenyl group of 8. However, the lack of aromatic resonance likely makes the edge-face interaction less favorable, possibly contributing to the lower binding affinity of 7 in comparison with 8 (Table 1). Inclusion of sulfur in this aliphatic ring increases inhibitory potency by a factor of 4 compared with a carbon ring system.8 This is likely due to the stronger interaction of sulfur with the mainchain CR of Gly54 and the ring edges of Tyr40 and Tyr126. The 7-substituent of 6 forms interactions similar to those for 7 and 8. In addition, the Tyr126 side chain hydroxyl is within hydrogen bond distance (2.9-3.1 Å) of a fluorine of the 7-trifluoropropyl group of 6. Though such an interaction may be weak, there is evidence from other protein-ligand crystal structures that they do occur.9 An Estimate of the Energetic Cost of the Active Site Perturbations. The changes in the hPNMT active site upon binding 7 or 8 are due in large part to the presence of the highly flexible side chain of Lys57 in the active site. To make room for the large 7-substituents, the side chain of Lys57 adopts an unfavorable rotamer conformation and induces an unfavorable conformation in the side chain of Cys60. In addition, there is a rigid body movement of the R3 helix on which these residues are located. We evaluated the effect of these conformational changes using the hPNMT mutant K57A, which we had prepared previously to investigate the role of this side chain on the binding of 1, 2, and 3.6 For the THIQ derivatives with small 7-substitutents, the mutation of Lys57 significantly reduces binding affinity (by 8-50-fold or 1.3-2.4 kcal/mol) of these three inhibitors and of inhibitor 4 (which also has a 3-substituent). This result is likely due to the loss of a favorable hydrogen

bond and a decrease in entropy due to the need to fill the space with water molecules. By comparison, the K57A mutation significantly increases the binding affinity of 7 and 8 (by 28175-fold or 2-3 kcal/mol), the two inhibitors that cause major active site perturbations. Binding of 5 induces disorder in the Lys57 side chain rather than an unfavorable conformation. It is interesting that mutation of Lys57 to alanine significantly increases the binding affinity of 5 (by 160-fold or 3 kcal/mol). This outcome suggests that the disordered state of Lys57, and the consequent lack of a hydrogen bond partner for this buried charged residue, is energetically costly. We also examined the hPNMT inhibition of 9, which is structurally related to 8, in that both possess the same 7-pchlorophenylsulfonamide substituent on the THIQ nucleus. The difference between the two compounds is that 9 contains a 3-fluoromethyl substituent, whereas 8 has a 3-hydroxymethyl substituent. In the absence of a crystal structure of hPNMT complexed with 9, we predicted that 9 would cause similar active site conformational changes to those induced by the binding of 7 or 8. This prediction was broadly borne out as the data for 9 (Table 1) show that it binds the K57A mutant almost

50-fold (or 2.3 kcal/mol) more tightly than the wt enzyme. Notably, the inhibition of hPNMT by 6, which does not induce changes to Lys57 or the R3 helix, but does perturb the R4 helix, is also improved by mutation of Lys57. However, in this case, the improvement is just 2-fold (0.4 kcal/mol). Effect of K57A Mutation on Inhibitor Binding and Protein Structure. The considerable changes we observe in the binding volume of hPNMT appear to stem largely from the interplay between Lys57 and bulky 7-substituents of the inhibitors. We therefore determined the crystal structures of K57A hPNMT in complex with the inhibitors 5, 7, and 8. In all three complexes, the inhibitor binding position is similar to that of wt hPNMT. Both the Ki values (Table 1) and B-factor analysis of 5, above, indicate tighter inhibitor binding for K57A than with wt hPNMT, and the fact that the K57A hPNMT/5 crystals grow easily within 2-3 days supports a stronger interaction. Collectively, these results agree with a scenario in which an unfavorable interaction occurs between the p-chlorophenyl of 5 and the side chain of Lys57 in the wt hPNMT/5 complex. It is this interaction that is responsible for the disorder observed in the crystal structure

and the reduced binding affinity of the inhibitor. Mutation of Lys57 to Ala relieves the strain, allowing a tighter binding interaction. The K57A hPNMT structures complexed with 7 and 8 do not exhibit the rigid body displacement of the R3 helix that was observed in the wt hPNMT structures (Figure 3I). Because these changes are not observed in the K57A hPNMT structures, it seems likely that they are induced by the interaction between Lys57 and these large inhibitors. However, it is noteworthy that in all three crystal structures of K57A hPNMT, with 5, 7, and 8, the perturbations observed for R4 and Tyr126 are present. This suggests that the R4 changes may be caused by steric interaction between the inhibitors and Tyr126. Interactions Formed by the THIQ 3-Substituent. The crystal structures reported here allow us to investigate the relative binding of 3-hydroxymethyl (4, 8) and 3-fluoromethyl (6, 7) groups (Figure 3). The 3-hydroxymethyl forms a favorable hydrogen bond via a direct interaction with the side chain of Glu219 (as predicted by modeling studies;10 Figure 3B,G,H) and possible water-mediated interactions with the side chain of Glu185 and mainchain oxygen of Phe182 (not shown). We found that the bound conformation of the 3-fluoromethyl substituents is variable. For example, the 3-fluoromethyl of 7 adopts different orientations in the two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 3F). In one of the two (modeled in hPNMTA), the fluorine is located close to the bound position of the 3-hydroxyl group of 8 or 4. In this orientation, the fluorine is within the hydrogen bond distance of the acidic side chain of Glu219. However, such an interaction would only be favorable if the Glu219 side chain is protonated, because fluorine is a hydrogen bond acceptor. In the second orientation (hPNMTB), the fluorine is within the hydrophobic interaction distance of the donor methyl group of AdoMet and within the hydrogen bond distance of a water (not shown). In both orientations, the fluorine is within hydrophobic interaction distance of Tyr222

Figure 5. Comparison of the binding modes of THIQ inhibitors. The superimposed bound inhibitors are shown with helix R3, including Lys57) on the left and residue Glu219 on the right. (A) Compared with 1 (yellow), the addition of a 3-substitutent in 4 (blue) induces a rotation around the long axis of the THIQ nucleus to enable access of the 3-substituent to the accessory binding cavity. A similar rotation is observed in other THIQ inhibitors with a 3-substituent (panel C). (B) Compared with 1 (yellow), the addition of a large bulky 7-substituent in 5 (green) causes a translational shift (to the right in this orientation) to enable the 7-substituent to fit within the steric constraints of the binding site. This shift is also apparent in panel D. The 7-substituent induces a disordered conformation of the Lys57 side chain, represented by transparent atoms. (C) Comparison of 1 (yellow) and 7 (pink). Inhibitors 7 (pink) and 6 and 8 (not shown), which have substituents at both 3- and 7-positions, do not undergo the translation observed upon binding 5, but do undergo the rotation observed for 4 (shown in panel A). (D) Inhibitors 5 (green) and 8 (purple) both have large, bulky 7-substituents. Compound 5 is translated in the active site (to the right in this orientation) so that the bulky 7-substituent can fit (inducing a disordered conformation of the Lys57 side chain, represented by transparent atoms). Inhibitor 8 (and 7, not shown) cannot undergo this shift because of the steric effect of the 3-substituent. Instead, conformational changes are induced in the enzyme, centered around Lys57, which increases the volume of the binding site.

(3.5-3.6 Å). The second conformation is similar to that predicted by modeling studies.10 In the structure of hPNMT with 6, the electron density for the 3-fluoromethyl group is weak or absent, suggesting that for this compound the fluorine does not form significant interactions with the enzyme. The varying position of the 3-fluoromethyl group indicates that it does not form especially favorable interactions. This finding agrees with comparisons of 3-methyl and 3-fluoromethyl THIQ inhibitors, showing that these have similar activities and indicating that the fluoro group does not contribute much toward binding affinity.11 Discussion Our results show that the binding site of hPNMT is plastic. It is able to accommodate small substrates such as norepinephrine as well as fused ring inhibitors such as THIQ and much larger substituted THIQ derivatives. This plasticity is, in the main, due to the flexibility of the side chain of the active site residue Lys57 as well as perturbations of secondary structural elements in the active site. The crystal structures of hPNMT complexed with 7 or 8, THIQ derivatives with large 7-thiomorpholinosulfonyl and 7-N-(p-chlorophenyl)aminosulfonyl groups, respectively, reveal a considerable increase in the volume of the hPNMT binding pocket of 140 Å3. The volume increase of the active site cavity is brought about by an unfavorable conformation of the side chain of Lys57, an induced unfavorable conformation of the Cys60 side chain, as well as rigid-body helix perturbations. These changes in the active site allow these two large compounds to bind with high affinity to hPNMT.

Enzyme Adaptation to Inhibitor Binding

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2007, Vol. 50, No. 20 4851

Structural characterization of the complexes of K57A hPNMT with 5, 7, and 8 revealed no perturbation to Cys60 or to the active site helix R3, indicating that these changes observed in wt hPNMT are a direct result of interactions with the conformationally flexible Lys57. The key role played by Lys57 allowed us to estimate the energetic cost of the changes by analyzing the binding affinity of inhibitors to wt and K57A hPNMT. The binding affinity of THIQ inhibitors with small 7-substituents (1, 2, 3, and 4) were reduced by 8-50-fold (1.32.4 kcal/mol) for the K57A mutant due to the loss of a favorable interaction with the Lys57 side chain. In contrast, the binding affinity of THIQ inhibitors with large, bulky 7-substituents was significantly improved for the K57A mutant compared with wt by 30-175-fold (2.0-3.0 kcal/mol). Similarly, the affinity of 5 for K57A hPNMT is increased by 160-fold (3.0 kcal/mol) compared with wt. This change indicates that the disordered nature of the Lys57 side chain and the p-chlorophenyl substituent of 5 are energetically costly, presumably because of the buried unpaired charge of the Lys57 side chain. Lys57 clearly plays a critical role in ligand binding in PNMT; it contributes to binding affinity for ligands with small hydrophilic 7-substituents by donating hydrogen bonds, it contributes to binding affinity for ligands with small hydrophobic 7-substituents by subtle conformational changes that allow interaction of the substituent with Met2584 and it affects binding affinity for ligands with large 7-substituents by adopting either a disordered conformation or a low probability conformation that induces other structural perturbations at the active site. Lysines are known to be particularly flexible acceptors in interactions involving ligands.12 The importance of Lys57 for PNMT activity is further highlighted by the fact that it is conserved in the sequences of all known mammalian full-length PNMT enzymes (human (NP_002677.1), chimp (XP_511459), rhesus monkey (XP_001089850), cow (NP_803471.1), pig (ABI97171), mouse (1903270A), rat (CAA53082.1), dog (XP_548143.2), and opossum (ENSEMBL GENSCAN00000038194)). Indeed, the entire sequence motif 52-GVGPWKLRC-60 is conserved in the mammalian PNMT orthologues (75-90% sequence identity with hPNMT) and both Lys57 and Cys60 are conserved in pufferfish (ENSEMBL GENSCANSLICE00000024452) and zebrafish (XP_700125.1) PNMT sequences (45-50% identity). The conformational changes we observed in hPNMT are not easily predicted in that the Lys57 and Cys60 conformations are low probability and are accompanied by rigid body helix movements. It is somewhat surprising then that these changes that increase the binding site volume can occur at such a relatively small energetic cost. This cost could reasonably be expected to be accommodated by most enzyme/protein systems. There are, of course, many examples in the literature of protein flexibility, as reviewed recently by Teague.13 However, most examples compare bound versus unbound protein conformations or reveal relatively minor changes in side chain conformations. A cryptic binding site was uncovered in p38 MAP kinase upon binding a modified inhibitor, 14 but in that instance the energetic cost was not evaluated. Could the conformation of Lys57 be modeled using rotameric sampling? We performed a docking study for inhibitors 1, 7, and 8 in which the side chains of the three hPNMT residues identified to be flexible (Lys57, Cys60, Tyr126) were allowed freedom to rotate during the docking calculations. The binding mode of 1 was predicted using this approach, but the binding modes of 7 and 8 were not (data not shown). Relative to the observed binding mode, both 7 and 8 were translated in the direction of the THIQ 3-position and rotated along the THIQ

axis, and unfavorable steric interactions were formed with the sulfonamide oxygen, the THIQ ring, and the p-chloro group. The conformation observed for the Lys57 side chain in the crystal structure (a high-energy syn-pentane-like conformation) is also not predicted using this approach. Instead, a conformation is predicted (rotamer probability 2.4%) that makes unfavorable steric interactions with the nearby Tyr185. We speculate that the observed high energy conformations of Lys57 and Cys60 in the hPNMT/7 and hPNMT/8 complexes may be stabilized by a buried amine-thiolate charge-charge interaction that is induced when the two sidechains are in close proximity. This would help explain the difficulty in predicting the observed conformational changes. In summary, hPNMT conceals a cryptic binding site that is uncovered through unexpected conformational changes when large inhibitors are bound. This cryptic binding site is likely to be present in all mammalian PNMTs because the residues involved in the conformational changes are conserved in the known sequences of mammalian PNMTs. Experimental Section
Crystallization of hPNMT. C-terminally His6-tagged wt hPNMT was expressed and purified as described previously.5,8 C-terminally His6-tagged K57A mutant hPNMT was expressed and purified in the same way. Protein was concentrated to 50-60 mg/mL and mixed with inhibitor (final concentration 9-40 mM) and substrate S-adenosyl-L-methionone (AdoMet, final concentration 2 mM) or product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy, final concentration 1.7-3.6 mM), taking the final concentration of protein to 35-44 mg/mL or 1-1.2 mM. The protein mixture was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion using drops comprising of 1 or 2 µL of protein and 1 or 2 µL of precipitant equilibrated over 100 or 400 µL of precipitant solution (0.6-1.2 M ammonium phosphate, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.3-5.8 for inhibitor 4, and 5-8% polyethylene glycol average molecular weight 6 K, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.1 M Na cacodylate pH 5.4-6.0 for all other inhibitors). Crystals of hPNMT with 5 required seeding and took 3-4 weeks to grow, whereas other crystals appeared within 2-3 days. The R-enantiomers of 4, 6, and 7 were used for the crystallization experiments. Racemic 8 was used in crystallizations, but only the R-enantiomer was bound to the enzyme. Phosphate buffer was used for the immobilized metal affinity chromatography purification of hPNMT and, in some cases (5 with wt hPNMT, 7 with K57A hPNMT), phosphate copurifies and cocrystallizes with the protein even though phosphate was not included in the crystallization buffer. Data Collection. Crystals of dimensions 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.25 mm3 were cryoprotected either by dipping into mother liquor supplemented with 25% glycerol for 30 s to 2 min or by stepping through mother liquor supplemented with 10, 20, and then 30% ethylene glycol for 1-2 min each. In both cases, crystals were then flash-cooled in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were measured using a Rigaku FR-E copper rotating anode generator operating at 45 kV, 45 mA with Osmic Confocal MaxFlux optics (either HiRes2 or Maxscreen). Reflections were measured with an R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate area detector. A Cryo Industries CryoCool LN2 was used for cooling the crystals during data measurement. Data were processed using Crystal Clear (Rigaku Corporation, (c) 1997-2002) and phasing was carried out using CNS v1.1.15 Structure Determination. The structures were solved by difference Fourier methods using the structure of PNMT/AdoHcy/1 (PDB accession code 1HNN1) as the starting model. The asymmetric unit was chosen so that the disulfide bonds observed in the structure were formed between molecules in the same asymmetric unit. Model building was performed using O16 or COOT17 and the structures were refined using CNS v1.115 or REFMAC18 followed by refinement in CNS. Initial coordinates for the inhibitors were generated using the Insight II 2000.1 (Accelrys) builder module or

SYBYL 7.0 (Tripos Associates Inc., 1699 S Hanley Rd., St. Louis, MO 63144). Topology and parameter files were generated using PRODRG19 or XPLO2D20 and modified where necessary. The procedure used was to refine the structure of the protein first, then water molecules were added, followed by addition of AdoHcy (or AdoMet), and finally the inhibitor was added. The criteria for including a water molecule were the presence of 2Fo - Fc density at 1 and Fo - Fc density at 3 and a possible hydrogen bond with a distance of less than 3.5 Å. R-free analysis (10% of reflections for 4, 6, and 7 with wt hPNMT or 5% of reflections for 5 with wt and 5, 7, and 8 with K57A hPNMT) was used for crossvalidation.21 Electron density for inhibitors 4, 6, 7, and 8 was clear and unambiguous in both molecules (hPNMTA and hPNMTB) in the asymmetric unit of wt and K57A hPNMT. This was also the case for 5 bound to K57A hPNMT. However, for the complex of wt hPNMT and 5, electron density corresponding to the inhibitor was only present in hPNMTA; at the hPNMTB active site, the electron density was consistent with a bound phosphate ion that copurifies with the protein. Consequently, analyses of 5 bound to wt hPNMT refer to hPNMTA. The electron density for the inhibitors was consistent in each case with the 3R-enantiomer. A figure showing the OMIT electron density for the inhibitors in all seven structures reported here is provided as Supporting Information Figure 1. For structural analysis, hPNMT structures were superimposed by CR position using COOT or the lsq module in O. Distances between equivalent CR atoms of the overlaid structures were then measured. Procheck22 was used to analyze the geometry and COOT was used to analyze rotamer probabilities, based on frequency of appearance in the PDB.7 The program CASTp23 with default settings was used to calculate the cavity volumes. The likelihood of virtual screening programs identifying compounds such as 7 and 8 as hits was evaluated by docking these inhibitors, and inhibitor 1, into the PNMT active site. GOLD v3.1 (copyright 2004, the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre) was used for the docking calculations. Three active site residues were identified as flexible (Lys57, Cys60, and Tyr126), and these were allowed to undergo torsional rotation around acyclic side chain bonds based on rotamer libraries;24 the inhibitors were allowed full flexibility about rotatable bonds. Figures were generated using SYBYL 7.0 (Tripos Associates Inc., 1699 S Hanley Rd., St. Louis, MO 63144), PyMOL (DeLano, W. L., The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (2002) DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA, http://www.pymol.org), Molscript,25 BobScript,26 and Raster3D.27 Ki Determinations. Both wt and K57A hPNMT were produced as described elsewhere.6 A standard inhibition assay mixture contained 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 8.0 and 5 µM AdoMet (including [3H]-AdoMet) in a total volume of 250 µL. The concentration of phenylethanolamine was varied between 0.4-2.5 × Km, while the inhibitor concentrations were varied between 0.42.5 × Ki. All 3-substituted inhibitors were used as the 3R-isomer, except 8, which was racemic. Following the addition of enzyme, the reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then quenched by the addition of 0.5 M boric acid (500 µL, pH 10.0). A total of 2 mL of a mixture of toluene/isoamyl alcohol (7:3) was added, and the samples were vortexed for 30 s. The phases were separated by centrifugation, and an aliquot of the organic phase (1 mL) was removed and added to 5 mL of scintillation fluid (Cytoscint, ICN). The radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Initial velocity data were then fitted to eq 1 using the Enzyme Kinetics module in SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.).
