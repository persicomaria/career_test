SUMMARY

The replacement of methionine by selenomethionine has been investigated in Escherichia coli. The analog is relatively non-toxic to growth of E. coli 26 at concentrations as high as o.oi M, provided cysteine is added to the growth medium. DLSelenomethionine, at I. lO .4 M, causes a 95 % reduction of methionine biosynthesis and is incorporated extensively into cellular proteins. The catalytic activity of fl-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) with 7o-75 % of its methionine residues replaced by selenomethionine, is the same as that of the unmodified enzyme. Although selenomethionine lengthens the generation time of E. coli 26, it has no effect on the overall rate of protein synthesis as measured by incorporation of E14Clphenylalanine, provided no amino acids (other than methionine) are limiting. Under the same conditions however, the rate of fl-galactosidase induction drops 35 % when selenomethionine is substituted for methionine. The analog causes significant inhibition of both bulk protein and fl-galactosidase synthesis if amino acids other than methionine are also limiting. Selenomethionine also supports the growth of a methionine-requiring auxotroph derived from E. coli 26, but no growth occurred in ethionine, norleucine, or c~-methylmethionine. The growth of E. coli K 12, however, is markedly inhibited by I. IO -4 M nL-selenomethionine whether or not cyst(e)ine is present.

INTRODUCTION

Methionine is utilized not only as a constituent in proteins, but in the initiation events of protein synthesis l - n , as a source of methyl groups 12-14 and it has been tentatively implicated in the catalytic mechanism of several enzymes which appear to lose activity after modification of a limited number of their methionine residues 1~-~. To investigate potential metabolic roles of methionine and particularly of its thioether group, it would be useful to study systems in which methionine had been replaced by an analog with subtle differences in properties. Selenomethionine appears to have desirable properties for such studies. Because of the similarities of sulfur and selenium in this type of bivalent linkage 24-~, the substitution of selenomethionine for methioA b b r e v i a t i o n s : P P O , 2 , 5 - d i p h e n y l o x a z o l e ; P O P O P , 1,4-bis-2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)benzene. * T a k e n , in part, f r o m a d i s s e r t a t i o n s u b m i t t e d b y E.C. to t h e G r a d u a t e School of D u k e U n i v e r s i t y in p a r t i a l fullfilment of t h e r e q u i r e m e n t s for t h e degree of D o c t o r of P h i l o s o p h y .

nine would be expected to have little effect where the thioether of methionine plays a passive role (e.g. as a hydrophobic residue in protein) but because of differences in chemical reactivity (selenium has a greater electron accepting ability and forms more polar bonds than sulfur), such a substitution might have marked effects on the more active roles of the methionine thioether (e.g. in the catalytic mechanisms of enzymes or in the formation and utilization of sulfonium compounds). Selenomethionine has been shown to support the growth of the E. coli methionine-requiring auxotroph ML 3o4 d2s. Other authors demonstrated that it could replace 53 °o of the methionine residues in fi-galactosidase obtained from a wild type E. coli strain adapted to growth in selenate, without causing a loss in catalytic activity 29. Although ethionine and norleucine can be incorporated into protein by microorganisms a°~5 they will not support growth in the absence of methionine. Ethionine could replace 4 ° % of the methionine residues in ~-amylase obtained from a methioninerequiring strain of Bacillus subtilis grown in oL-ethionine and L-methionine without loss of activity a6. However, the increasing replacement of methionine in fl-galactosidase by ethionine in a prototrophic strain of E. coli led to the formation of progressively less active enzymeaL Methionine has not been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of this enzymeas, and so the observation that selenomethionine 29 could replace methionine as a "passive" residue but that ethionine a~ could not, suggests that selenomethionine causes less nonspecific structural distortion of proteins than ethionine. This report describes the effect of selenomethionine on the growth of E. coil 26, as well as the effect of this analog on certain of the cell's metabolic systems which normally use, or are controlled by, methionine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

DL-Selenomethionine and ~-DL-methylmethionine were obtained from the Cyclo Chemical Corp., DL-selenocystine from Sigma, isopropyl-fl-D-thiogalactoside and onitrophenyl-fi-D-galactoside from Mann, chloramphenicol from Parke, Davis and Co., and puromycin from Nutritional Biochemicals. L- EaaSlMethionine and L- [14Clphenylalanine were purchased from Amersham-Searle, L-[aSSlcystine from Volk Radiochemical Co., H 2a5SO4 from New England Nuclear, and L-[75Selselenomethionine from Squibb. Growth media and cell density measurements Minimal mediumwas modified Davis-Mingioli mediumagcontaining 7 g K~HPO4, 3 g KH2PO4, I g (NH4)2SO4, and o.I g MgSO4.7H20 per 1. The carbon source was dextrose (1%) unless otherwise indicated. Complete medium was nutrient broth (Difco). During growth measurements, flasks or tubes containing the cells were shaken at 3 7 in either air or water incubators. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance of cell suspensions at 550 nm in either a Spectronic 2o or a Gilford Model 240. Absorbanee measurements were proportional to cell density in either instrument up to 0.8 absorbance unit, above which dilutions were made. 3/[ethionine biosynthesis measurements E. coli 26 cells were grown in medium containing 3 g KH~PO4, 7 g K2HPO4, 0.245 g MgC12"6H20, 0.05 g ( N H 4 ) 2 S O 4 ( a p p r o x . 3 . 6 . 1 o -4 M), 1.8 g NH4C1, and I o g

dextrose per 1. Either H235S04 or L-L35S]cystine (each at I" 107 counts/min per #mole) were added as the source of label. I)L-Methionine or its analogs (DL-selenomethionine, DL-ethionine, L-norleucine) were added as indicated. The cells were grown in radioactive medium for an 8-Io-fold increase in cell density and then harvested at log phase (absorbance usually 0.8 at 550 nm). They were then hydrolyzed in vacuo at lO5 ° in 6 M HC1 for 24 h, lyophilized, and redissolved in o.oi M HC1. Paper chromatography on Whatman No. I or No. 4 ° chromatography paper in n-butanol-acetic acid-water ( 4 : I : I , by vol.) gave good separation of methionine from cyst(e)ine, homocyst(e)ine, cystathionine, and sulfate. The chromatograms were first scanned with a Packard Strip Scanner to distinguish the position of the radioactive peaks and estimate the level of background radioactivity. They were then cut into I-cm sections and counted in the Packard Tri-Carb liquid scintillation spectrometer using 5 ml of Seintillant (0. 4 % 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) and o.oi % 1,4-bis-2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)benzene (POPOP) in toluene).

Ami~zo acid analyses
For quantitative amino acid analyses of whole cell protein, acid soluble radioactivity was removed by extraction with cold 6 % HC10 a (approx. 5 ml per 2 mg cells) and twice with 6 M HC1. Hydrolysis of the proteins (whole cells or fl-galactosidase} was carried out in vacuo at lO5 ° for 24 h in 6 M HCI. Amino acid analyses were made with the Beckman Model 12o Amino Acid Analyzer column using Beckman PA-28 spherical resin at 55 °. Methionine was well resolved, and selenomethionine was eluted between isoleucine and leucine. When the leucine and isoleucine contents of a sample were more than twice the selenomethionine content, direct measurement of the area was not feasible. Selenomethionine content was usually determined by use of E75Se~ selenomethionine in the growth or induction experiments and measurement of the radioactivity in the column eluate. These measurements were made either using a stream divider or a Packard continuous flow cell attachment. The recovery of a known amount of I~5Selselenomethionine under these hydrolytic conditions (in the presence or absence of cells) was 60 °,5 and the recovery of methionine was 95 %.

Neutro~, activation analysis
Neutron activation analyses were performed by the Nuclear and Biological Sciences Division of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Samples were irradiated for a period of IO sec in a flux of about I. lO 13 thermal neutrons/cm 2 per sec and counted for 30 sec for measurement of the 18 see half-life selenium 77m (ref. 40).

Whole cell protein synthesis
Cells were grown in nutrient broth, harvested, and resuspended to the desired cell density in minimal medium containing 0.5 °o glycerol. In some experiments the minimal medium was supplemented with 2-lO -4 M of the following L-amino acids: tryptophan, isoleucine, leucine, proline, threonine, lysine, phenylalanine, glycine, aspartic acid, alanine, valine, arginine, glutamie acid, serine, histidine, tyrosine and cysteine. Solutions of L-cysteine were made prior to each experiment. Cells were preincubated for a few minutes at 37 ° and the reaction was initiated by addition of radioactive amino acid. Aliquots were removed at indicated times from the vigorously shaking flasks for radioactivity and cell density measurements. Samples were absorbed

IO-a M. /o The discs were washed sequentially with ethanol, e t h a n o l - c h l o r o f o r m - e t h e r (2:2:1, b y vol.), and twice with ether. When dry, they were placed in vials with 5 ml of scintillation mixture (0.4 % PPO, o.oi % P O P O P in toluene) and counted in the P a c k a r d Tri-Carb liquid scintillation spectrometer. This washing procedure r e i n . r e d 99.6 o, of the free labelled amino acid from the discs. The incorporation of radio/o activity into dichloroacetic acid-precipitable material at 37 proceeded linearly with respect to both time and cell concentration, and was completely inhibited by the addition of either puromycin (2 mg/ml) or chloramphenicol (o.I rag/m1).

fi-Galactosidase induction and activity measurements Cells were grown in nutrient broth (unless otherwise indicated), harvested, and resuspended (to a density of i at 550 nm) in minimal medium containing 0.5'.'0 glycerol and other indicated supplements. After lO--15 rain preincubation at 37 :, isopropyl-fi-D-thiogalactoside, at a final concentration of o.ooi M (a saturating level) was added and the formation of fl-galactosidase was monitored b y transferring appropriate aliquots of cells at the indicated times to tubes containing I ml of chloramphenicol solution (I mg/ml). Aliquots were also removed at the same time for cell density measurements. The samples for assay were centrifuged, the cells were washed once with minimal medium without a carbon source, and resuspended in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7-5. Cells were incubated at 37 ° for I5 rain in the presence of 0.05 vol. of toluene. Aliquots of toluenized cells were incubated in pH 7.5 phosphate containing 8.6. lO -4 M o-nitrophenyl-fi-B-galactoside. Release of o-nitrophenol was followed b y measurement of the increase in absorption at 41o nm with a Gilford Model 2000 recording spectrophotometer. Large scale induction of enzyme for purification was carried out similarly except cells were suspended at an initial cell density of 6.0. If not processed immediately after growth, induced cells were stored frozen. For assays of sonic extracts and purified enzyme the incubation mixtures contained o.I M sodium phosphate, p H 7.0, o.ooi M MgC1,,, o.I M mercaptoethanol, and 8. IO -4 M o-nitrophenyl-/~-D-galactoside. For kinetic measurements enzyme was added to buffer without substrate, preincubated at 37 ° one min, and the reaction was initiated with the desired concentration of o-nitrophenyl-/%I)-galactoside. Tris-phosphate buffers between p H ().o and 9.5 (o.I M in Tris and phosphate) were used for determination of the effect of p H on activity. For calculation of the reaction velocities at each pH, the extinction coefficient at 41o n m for o-nitrophenol in each buffer was determined at 37 with a Cary Model 14 recording spectrophotometer. Protein was determined b y the m e t h o d of ZAMEXHOF4~.
RESULTS When E. coli strain 26 is incubated in minimal medium containing I. IO -a M DL-selenomethionine growth is the same as t h a t obtained in unsupplemented medium. Addition of increasing amounts of selenomethionine to the medium causes a progressive decrease in the rate and final level of growth (Fig. I). Under the same conditions equal concentrations of I)z-methionine have no effect on growth. The inhibition of growth b y selenomethionine can be reversed b y addition of i. I o _4 M L-cysteine to

Microscopic examination revealed t h a t cells from the inhibited cultures (greater t h a n i. lO -4 M selenomethionine without cysteine) had a spherical shape, whereas cells from uninhibited cultures (minimal or up to I.

toxic effects of o.oi M nL-selenomethionine can also be reversed b y o.oi M DLmethionine as well as by 5" lO-5 M L-cysteine but r. lO -4 M DL-methionine has no measurable effect on the growth inhibition. Investigation of the toxicity of the selenium analog of cystine showed t h a t growth of E. coli 26 was m a r k e d l y inhibited b y I . lO -4 M DL-selenocystine (less t h a n 2-fold increase in 30 h). If equimolar L-cysteine were also present in the medium, cells grew to the same final level as was obtained in medium with cysteine alone (over a 2o-fold increase) but at slower rate. It had been reported previously ~s t h a t a methionine auxotroph of another strain of E. coli (ML 3o4 d) grew exponentially on selenomethionine. We have similarly shown t h a t a methionine a u x o t r o p h of E. coli 26 (Strain 26-1o) grows exponentially on I. lO -4 M DL-selenomethionine although the generation time is 1. 5 times longer than is obtained with i - l O -4 M DL-methionine. Neither norleucine, ethionine nor a-methylmethionine could support growth of this strain. These growth studies with selenomethionine were repeated with a wild-type strain of E. coli KI2.

To measure the relative effect of selenomethionine on t h e r a t e of m e t h i o n i n e biosynthesis in E. coli 26, cells were grown in a modified m i n i m a l m e d i u m with either 35SO42- or l.-EasS]cystine as the source of labelled sulfur, a n d the i n c o r p o r a t i o n of counts into t o t a l cell m e t h i o n i n e was measured.

During the induction of/5-galactosidase in E. coli 26 cells for subsequent purification, the rate of formation of enzyme was observed to be significantly slower in cultures containing selenomethionine than in those with methionine. Since the catalytic activity of fl-galactosidase containing an extensive selenomethionine substitution was not changed, it appeared that the analog was somehow affecting the rate of induction of fi-galactosidase or perhaps the rate of protein synthesis in general. The effect of selenomethionine on both these systems was therefore more closely scratinized. The rate of fi-galactosidase induction in E. coli 26 was studied under conditions similar to those used for the purification of the enzyme, except that a lower cell density was used. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the rate of induced enzyme formation in both methionine-supplemented medium and unsupplemented medium was low for the first hour or so and then gradually accelerated. In the culture containing selenomethionine however, synthesis was markedly reduced, so that at the end of the experimental period enzyme activity in this culture was less than Io °o of that in the other two. The selenomethionine inhibition could be progressively diminished by the addition of increasing amounts of methionine as shown in Fig. 6 (the initial cell density in this experiment was 3.0). fl-Galactosidase induction of broth-grown cells was repeated in medium supplemented with 17 amino acids including l~-cysteine (each at 2. Io -4 M) in addition to either DL-methionine or nL-selenomethionine (4" lO-4 M). In the presence of these

additional amino acids, fi-galactosidase synthesis in either methionine or selenomethionine was much faster and linear for about IOO rain (Fig. 7). The induction rate in the latter medium however, was approx. 35 9° lower than that in methionine. If cells were pregrown in ininimal medium, then induced in mininlal medium containing cysteine and either methionine or selenomethionine, the rate of fi-galactosidase induction was the same as depicted in Fig. 7, whether or not the additional 16 amino acids were also added. With these two effects of selenomethionine on fl-galactosidase induction (marked inhibition with an amino acid deficiency, marginal inhibition with amino acid supplementation) in mind, attention was turned to the influence of this analog on the protein synthetic machinery. Investigation of a purified E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase had established that the enzyme had very similar Km's for both methionine and selenomethionine 44. Further work in this laboratory with a cruder preparation from E. coli 26 cells ~7 demonstrated that both methionine and selenomethionine competed equally well in this reaction, and that selenomethionine itself was converted into its tRNA derivative

about twice as fast as methionine. There appeared to be no slowdown at this initial activation step of the amino acid when selenomethionine replaced methionine. The effect of selenomethionine on total cell protein synthesis was monitored by measuring the rate at which radioactive phenylalanine was incorporated into protein. Cells were grown first in nutrient broth, then harvested and resuspended in the same way as for/5-galactosidase induction measurements. As shown in Fig. 8, tile rate of incorporation in unsupplemented medium was low initially and then gradually accelerated. The addition of methionine alone to the minimal medium did not cause any increase in this rate, but the addition of selenomethionine alone caused a significant reduction. These results are the same as had been found in/%galactosidase induction under the same conditions (Fig. 5). If the remaining amino acids were also added to the medium, however, there was no difference observed in the rate of phenylalanine incorporation between methionine-supplemented and selenomethionine-supplemented media (Fig. 8), even if selenomethionine was added at an 8-fold higher concentration (Fig. 9)- If neither methionine nor selenomethionine were added to medium containing the 17 other amino acids (Fig. 9), the rate of incorporation was much slower and no longer linear, indicating that methionine was indeed initiallv limiting in these ceils. The rate of incorporation of EasS~methionine and [75Selselenomethionine into protein was monitored under the same conditions. When other amino acids were provided in the medium, selenomethionine was incorporated at the same rate as was methionine, but in the absence of other amino acids, selenomethionine incorporation was significantly slower than that of methionine. The relative rates were very similar to those shown in Fig. 8 for [t4Clphenylalanine incorporation. The experiments reported above on protein synthesis were also performed on E. coli K 12, which had previously been shown to be unable to grow in selenomethionine at low cell densities (Fig. 3). Measurements of methionyl-tRNA synthetase, ~-galactosidase induction, and Et4Clphenylalanine incorporation in K I2 cells gave essentially the same results as have been reported above with E. coli 26 (ref. 27).
DISCUSSION

E. coli 26 cells are able to utilize selenomethionine in presence of very low intracellular methionine. At a concentration of I. IO-4 M, the analog caused over a 90 °o reduction in methionine biosynthesis and was itself extensively incorporated into cellular proteins. Selenomethionine also supported exponential growth of a methionine-requiring auxotroph derived from E. coli 26 whereas the other methionine analogs norleucine, ethionine, and c~-methylmethionine could not. The extensive replacement of methionine by selenomethionine in the total cell proteins of the wild strain argues that the resulting selenomethionine-containing proteins are active enough to support cell growth. To test the effects of such an incorporation on the activity of one enzyme,/5-galactosidase was induced in and purified from cells incubated in the presence of the analog. The resulting enzyme was shown to have greater than 70 % substitution of selenomethionine for methionine yet its catalytic activity remained unchanged. Similar results were obtained by others who purified/%galactosidase with a 53 % selenomethionine substitution from E. coli K 12 adapted to growth in selenate 29.

trophic strain of E. coli, showed that increasing levels of ethionine led to decreases in /3-galactosidase activity without affecting the concentration of immunologically cross-reacting material. Thus it would appear t h a t the substitution of ethionine for methionine leads to formation of inactive enzyme,. Since methionine is not known to play a role in the catalytic mechanism of fl-galactosidase ~, the introduction ~f an extra methylene group into the methionine side chain probably interferes with the spatial relationships necessary for folding the enzyme into an active conformation. In view of these results, selenomethionine can be considered a potentially useful tool for the s t u d y of enzymes in which methionine m a y participate more directly in the catalytic mechanism. The involvement of an amino acid residue at the active site of an enzyme has often been deduced from studies in which chemical modification of t h a t residue was observed to result in a loss of enzyme activity. Several enzymes have been reported to be inactivated b y modification (oxidation, alkylation) of one or a few methionine residues ~5-2~. These modification reactions, however, greatly change the polarity of the methionine side chain, and such a change could seriously alter the enzyme conformation and be responsible for the loss of activity observed 4"~,an The replacement of the sulfur in methionine by selenium constitutes a nmch more subtle change and one which would not be expected to greatly affect the conformation of the enzyme. The observation of a significant activity loss in selenomethioninecontaining enzymes m a y therefore be indicative of a more active functional role for methionine in the catalytic mechanism, i.e. one which specifically requires participation of the methionine sulfur. In any case, the observation that both E. coli 2~ and its m u t a n t 26-1o could be continuously subcultured in the presence of the analog indicates t h a t the substitution of selenium for sulfur in methionine does not lethally impair the function of any essential proteins. Although the analog did not prevent the growth of these cells, its presence in the growth medium did cause an increase in the generation time of both wild and m u t a n t strains. To ascertain whether this was due to a slowdown in the rate of protein synthesis, the rate of fl-galactosidase induction and of I14C~phenylalanine incorporation into cell protein were measured. When measurements were made in unsupplemented minimal medium using cells which were pregrown in nutrient broth, protein synthesis and enzyme induction showed a lag of about one hour followed by accelerating rates. T h a t this lag is due to a limited ability for amino acid synthesis by the broth grown cells is shown by the observations that addition of 17 amino acids to the incubation medium abolishes the lag and that no lag is seen when cells pregrown in minimal medium are used, whether or not the incubation medium is supplemented with amino acids. Under these conditions of relative amino acid deficiency, addition of selenomethionine and cysteine to the incubation medium inhibited both protein synthesis (measured either with ~4Cjphenylalanine or [75Se~selenomethionine~ and enzyme induction whereas methionine and cysteine had no effect. The additi(m of increasing amounts of methionine to the selenomethionine containing incubation leads to progressive increases in the rates of these processes suggesting that the effect is due to selenomethionine rather than to an unidentified inhibitor in the selenomethionine preparation. The apparent preferential utilization of methionine when both compounds are available m a y be due to the fact that E. coli 26 concentrates methionine from the medium more rapidly than selenomethionine 27. When amino acid incorporation was measured in medium supplemented with 16 amino acids plus methioBiochim. lgiophys, dcta, 230 (T971) ~ z 3 - z 3 6

nine or selenomethionine, the rates were much higher and linear from the earliest time measured and identical rates of incorporation were obtained in both media. These results suggest that selenomethionine is interfering with the synthesis of one or more amino acids required for protein synthesis but does not significantly retard the incorporation of available amino acids. The rate of fl-galactosidase induction in media supplemented with amino acids is also linear but is only 2/3 as great as in medium containing methionine. The same decrease in the rate of/5-galactosidase induction in the presence of selenomethionine is observed using cells pregrown in minimal medium. This inhibition of fi-galactosidase induction is less than that {}bserved by COWlE AND COHEN~ who reported a 7o °o decrease in the rate of fl-galactosidase formation when E. coli ML 3o4d was induced in the presence of selenomethionine. The basis for the difference in the effects of selenomethionine on fl-galactosidase synthesis and bulk protein synthesis is unknown. Many of the studies performed on strain 26 were also performed on another wild strain, E. coli K I 2 (ref. 27). Although the protein synthetic system of KT_2 responded identically to that of strain 26 in all the experiments described above, the results of growth experiments were markedly different. It was found that selenomethionine even as low as I. IO-5 M significantly slowed growth at low cell densities; in I. IO -4 M DL-selenomethionine only slightly over a 2-fold increase in cell density occurred. Further experiments had indicated that the toxic mechanism in K I2 is apparently different from that in strain 26 and is not reparable by cyst(e)ine supplementation. A mutant of K 12 (D7) (ref. 47), which contained much lower levels of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase than its parent strain, could however grow in selenomethionine at concentrations which reduced its methionine biosynthesis over 9 ° %. This result suggested that selenomethionine toxicity in K 12 may involve the selenium analog of S-adenosylmethionine. The ability of selenomethionine to replace methionine in E. coli cellular methylations 12-14 is not known. The enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthetase from both strains 26 and K 12 can utilize selenomethionine at about twice the rate as it uses methionine 27 to form the selenium analog of S-adenosylmethionine. Adenosyl selenomethionine formed by rabbit or yeast S-adenosylmethionine svnthetase was shown to be utilized in vitro by a pig liver creatine methylpherase system 4s but whether it can be utilized efficiently by E. coli has not been assessed thus far.
