Abstract Type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) is an essential process for bacteria survival, and malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT) is a key enzyme in FAS II pathway, which is responsible for transferring the malonyl group from malonyl-CoA to the holo-ACP by forming malonyl-ACP. In this work, we described the cloning, characterization and enzymatic inhibition of a new MCAT from Helicobacter pylori strain SS1 (HpMCAT), and the gene sequence of HpfabD was deposited in the GenBank database (Accession No. AY738332). Enzymatic characterization of HpMCAT showed that the Km value for malonyl-CoA was 21.01 ± 2.3 lM, and the thermal- and guanidinium hydrochloride-induced unfolding processes for HpMCAT were quantitatively investigated by circular dichroism spectral analyses. Moreover, a natural product, corytuberine, was discovered to demonstrate inhibitory activity against HpMCAT with IC50 value at 33.1 ± 3.29 lM. Further enzymatic assay results indicated that corytuberine inhibits HpMCAT in an uncompetitive manner. To our knowledge, this is the firstly reported MCAT inhibitor to date. This current work is hoped to supply useful information for better understanding the MCAT features of H. pylori strain, and corytuberine might be used as a potential lead compound in the discovery of the antibacterial agents using HpMCAT as target.

1. Introduction Fatty acid biosynthesis is an essential pathway for the survival of the organism since fatty acid is the major components of cell membrane and possesses important biological function. In nature, according to the enzyme involved in the pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) is divided into two types, type I (FAS I) and type II (FAS II) [1­3]. In FAS I system, found in animals, the biosynthesis of fatty acid is catalyzed by a multi-enzyme, which is a single polypeptide with eight distinct

domains. However, during the FAS II system, the reactions are carried out by a series of structurally dissociated enzymes as discovered in most of the bacteria [1,2]. Due to the large differences between these two FAS systems, the enzymes involved in the type II fatty acid biosynthesis have been developed as the attractive targets for the discovery of antibacterial agents [2]. Malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT; FabD; EC2.3.1.39) is a vital enzyme within FAS II system, it catalyzes the transfer of a malonyl moiety from malonyl-CoA to holo-ACP, forming malonyl-ACP as the elongation substrate for the fatty acid biosynthesis [4­7]. The research has indicated that MCAT is essential for the completion of fatty acid synthesis, and the genetic inactivation of fabD is lethal in all pathogens [6,8,9]. Moreover, according to the recent report that the MCAT might participate in polyketide biosynthesis, it was regarded as the possible link between fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis [10­12]. Therefore, MCAT has become a promising target in the discovery of antibacterial agents. The solved crystal structures of MCAT from Escherichia coli (EcMCAT) (PDB code:1MLA) and Streptomyces coelicolor (ScMCAT) (PDB code:1NM2) indicated that both of these structures have similar structures, and the catalytic active site is composed of two subdomains [10,13,14]. One is made up of a short four-stranded parallel b-sheet and 12 helices, and the other contains a four-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet and two helices. The active residue (Ser 97) is reported to locate in the canyon of the two subdomains [10]. The overall structure of MCAT could be thus generally depicted as a typical a/b hydrolase model [10,13]. It is known that MCAT performs the transfer of malonyl group to the holo-ACP via the pingpong bi­bi mechanism involving the His-Ser catalytic domain commonly contained in the serine-dependent acylhydrolases. The unusual feature for this mechanism is related to the existence of the stable MCAT-malonyl intermediate, while in most hydrolases, the formed possible enzyme-substrate intermediates might be rapidly broken down by the nucleophilic attack from the water molecules. It is reported that the formed stable MCAT-malonyl intermediate might be ascribed to the key residues of Arg117, Gln11, Gln63 in the structure of MCAT, which could interact with the malonate carboxylate group [2,10,13,15]. In recent years, bacterial diseases and antibiotic-resistant infections are globally increasing. They have become worldwide problems and governed the urgent needs for new drug design based on novel antibacterial targets [1,2,16]. Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative clinic pathogenic bacterium, which is related to peptic ulcer and gastric cancer [17,18]. In this work,

W. Liu et al. / FEBS Letters 580 (2006) 697­702 was washed with buffer B (20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 40 mM imidazole) for several times and eluted with buffer C (20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole). The proper concentration of HpMCAT was obtained by ultra filtration using Amicon centrifugal device and determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm with the extinction coefficient of 19 785 L/mol/ cm. 2.4. Circular dichroism (CD) technique based unfolding analysis All the CD spectral investigations for HpMCAT were carried out using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter under constant nitrogen flow. The HpMCAT concentration was 0.3 mg/ml in 50 mM, pH 6.8, phosphate buffer for far-UV (190­250 nm) assay using 1 mm quartz cell. To determine the temperature-induced unfolding of HpMCAT, the change of ellipticity at 220 nm was recorded at a scan speed of 0.2 °C/min from 20 to 90 °C. Since the buffer solution showed no changes with the increase of temperature, the potential buffer-caused effect could be neglected during data analysis. During the guanidinium hydrochloride (GndHCl)-induced unfolding experiment, the spectra were obtained with 2-h incubation at room temperature including the supplement of corresponding concentration of GndHCl. Experimental data were corrected by subtracting the blank obtained under the same conditions in the absence of protein sample. The standard free energy change of GndHCl-induced unfolding process (DG) for HpMCAT was obtained in terms of the typical two state transition mechanism. In this unfolding reaction, the equilibrium constant (Ku) could be expressed as follows: K u ¼ ð1 À F app Þ=F app ; F app ¼ ðh À hU Þ=ðhN À hU Þ; ð1Þ

we cloned and expressed the MCAT enzyme from H. pylori strain and some biochemical characterization was also performed against this enzyme. In addition, a natural product, corytuberine, was discovered to demonstrate inhibitory activity against HpMCAT in an uncompetitive manner. Corytuberine is a kind of alkaloid with multi-pharmacological activity. To our knowledge, this is the firstly reported MCAT inhibitor to date. Our work is hoped to supply useful information for better understanding the MCAT features of H. pylori strain, and the inhibitor corytuberine might be used as a potential lead compound in the discovery of antibacterial agents.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials and strains H. pylori strain SS1 was obtained from our institute. E. coli host strain M15 was purchased from Qiagen. The natural product corytuberine (Fig. 1) was from a chemical library containing 5000 compounds established in our lab. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or ultra-pure quality, and commercially available. 2.2. Cloning of the fabD gene from H. pylori (HpfabD) Based on the genome sequences of H. pylori strains 26695 and J99 (GenBank Accession Nos. NC_000915 and NC_000921), two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers (forward: 5 0 -CAAAATCCACGCCAAACAATTCTAG-3 0 and reverse: 5 0 -CTTTAATGGTTTCTAAACAAAACTAAGGGC-3 0 ) were designed to amplify the corresponding region containing fabD gene from the chromosome of H. pylori strain SS1. The genomic DNA of H. pylori strain SS1 as a template was prepared by using Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Sangon). The reaction was performed for 30 cycles: 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 53 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C. The amplified DNA segment was purified and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. According to the sequencing result, a pair of primers (sense: 5 0 TTTGGATCCATGCAATACGCGCTATTA-3 0 , and antisense: 5 0 GGGGAAGCTTTCACACGTATTCTAA-3 0 ) was synthesized to amplify the fabD gene from H. pylori strain SS1. The following protocol was conducted for amplification: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, 30 cycles. The PCR products were digested with restriction endonuclease BamHI and HindIII (Fermentas), and ligated into a prokaryotic expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) to produce the recombinant plasmid pQE30-HpfabD that contains an N-terminal six-histidine tag for purification purpose. After the recombinant clone pQE30-HpfabD was sequenced, the nucleotide sequence of fabD gene from H. pylori strain SS1 was submitted to GenBank database under the Accession No. AY738332. 2.3. Expression and purification of HpMCAT pQE30-HpfabD was transformed into E. coli strain M15 growing in LB media supplemented with 100 lg/ml of ampicillin and 50 lg/ml of kanamycin at 37 °C. When OD600 reached 0.8, the culture was induced by 0.4 mM isopropyl-b-D -thiogalasctopyranoside and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 · g for 15 min at 4 °C and suspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris­ HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole). After sonication treatment on ice, the mixture yielded a clear supernatant by centrifugation at 16 000 · g for 45 min at 4 °C, which was loaded onto a column with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column

where h is the observed ellipticity value in 220 nm of HpMCAT at a given GndHCl concentration, hU and hN are the ellipticity values when HpMCAT is completely unfolded and in native state, respectively. The calculation of the standard free energy of GndHCl-induced unfolding (DG) is obtained according to the following equation: DG ¼ ÀRT lnðK u Þ; ð2Þ

where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature. DG is then fitted to the linear regression by the concentration of GndHCl (C) using the following equation [19]: DG ¼ mC þ DGH2 O ; ð3Þ

where the slope (m) is the cooperative index, which reflects the ability of the denaturant to unfold a protein. DGH2 O could be calculated by linear extrapolation, which represents the structural stability of HpMCAT in buffer. At the midpoint concentration of GndHCl (Cm), DG is zero, Cm could be thus calculated according to Eq. (3). 2.5. Enzyme activity assay The enzymatic activity of HpMCAT was measured by using the aketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH)-coupled assay system [20]. In this system, the coenzyme A (CoASH) generated by HpMCAT is the substrate for the KDH-dependent reaction, which is accompanied by the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The rate of NAD+ is detected as a change in fluorescence using a 96-well plate system (Tecan GENios reader) with an excitation wavelength at 340 nm and the emission wavelength at 465 nm. The assay solution contained 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM a-ketoglutaric acid, 0.25 mM NAD+, 0.2 mM TPP, 1 lg HpMCAT, 10 lM acyl carrier protein (ACP), 5 mU/100 ll KDH, and 25 lM malonyl-CoA. The reaction was formed in the following order with 50 ll HpMCAT solution, 25 ll ACP/KDH mix, and then 25 ll malonyl-CoA to initiate the reaction. The change of NADH fluorescence was recorded for 30 min at 30 °C. The concentrations of malonyl-CoA were individually varied as required to obtain the Km value for HpMCAT toward malonyl-CoA. The influence of temperature on the enzymatic activity was determined from 20 to 50 °C. For the enzyme inhibition studies, the test compound dissolved in 1% DMSO was pre-incubated with HpMCAT at 30 °C for 1 h before the reaction was started. In considering that the inhibitor might interfere with the activity of KDH, the counter-screen was performed against KDH to identify its effect on the KDH activity [20].

3. Results and discussion 3.1. fabD gene sequence analysis In the current work, the fabD gene from H. pylori strain SS1 (HpfabD) was successfully cloned based on the available genome sequences of H. pylori strains 26695 and J99, and the recombinant expression plasmid pQE30-HpfabD was generated by inserting the amplified fabD fragment into the vector pQE30. The HpfabD gene was a 930 bp fragment including the stop codon. Fig. 2 showed the amino acid sequence alignment of HpMCAT with other MCATs from several other model organisms by Clustal W (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw). It was found that HpMCAT shared 32% identity and 53% similarity with MCAT of E. coli (EcMCAT) in amino acid sequence. In addition, two highly conserved motifs (GHSXH, PGQGXQ) and other conserved residues were observed. According to the previous reports involving the crystallographic and catalytic mechanism analyses for MCAT, MCAT performs the transfer of malonyl to holo-ACP including two reactions [4,7,10]. Firstly, the MCAT binds the malonyl-CoA substrate to form a stable tetrahedral malonyl-MCAT intermediate, the holo-ACP could then dock on the surface of the intermediate by hydrophobic interaction [10]. Thus, MCAT enzyme was generally considered to contain at least two active sites, the malonyl-CoA binding site and the holo-ACP binding site. It is suggested that the two highly conserved motifs and residues might be related to the active sites formation [2,10,13].

3.2. Purification and characterization of HpMCAT HpMCAT could be successfully expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal 6· His tag. It could be purified by a one-step purification protocol judged from SDS­PAGE (Fig. 3A), and Electron-spray ionization mass spectrometry yielded a molecular mass about 35 755 Da (Supplementary material), in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass according to the amino acids compositions. The far-UV CD spectrum of native HpMCAT in, pH 6.8, 50 mM phosphate buffer at 25 °C revealed two negative peaks at 209 and 220 nm, implying that this protein contains a significant amount of a-helix as shown in Fig. 3B [21]. According to the JASCO secondary structure estimation software, in the native state of HpMCAT, its a-helix is about 64.2%, which is higher than that obtained from EcMCAT based on its crystal structure (49.5%, a-helix) [13]. 3.3. Enzymatic kinetics analysis It is known that HpMCAT catalyzes the transfer of a malonyl moiety from malonyl-CoA to the free thiol of phosphopantetheine arm of ACP using the ping-pong mechanism [10,20], which could be depicted in the reactions as follows: Malonyl-CoA + holo-ACP $ malonyl-ACP + CoASH CoASH + NADþ + a-ketoglutarate ! succinyl-CoA + NADH + CO2 ð4Þ ð5Þ

The rate of NAD+ reduction to NADH could be recorded as a change in fluorescence. The enzymatic results thus showed that HpMCAT was active with Km at 21.01 ± 2.3 lM toward the malonyl-CoA as indicated in Fig. 4, similar to that of EcMCAT [20], and smaller than that of ScMCAT [22]. In addition, the HpMCAT enzyme showed the highest enzymatic activity at 30 °C. When the temperature was increased to 50 °C, the enzyme could only possess about 20% activity as shown in Fig. 5. 3.4. Enzyme unfolding analyses To determine the influence of temperature on the stability of HpMCAT, the thermal-induced unfolding experiment was carried out using CD technique. As shown in Fig. 6A, HpMCAT began to lose its secondary structure at 50 °C, and its secondary structure was totally destroyed when the temperature was raised to 70 °C. However, it is noticed that the enzymatic activity of HpMCAT was mostly vanished even when the temperature was raised to 45 °C as indicated in Fig. 5. This result implied that the secondary structure of HpMCAT seems to be more thermostable in comparison with its three-dimensional structure.

Fig. 5. Effect of temperature on the HpMCAT enzymatic activity.

In order to further gain insights into the thermal-induced unfolding process, the thermodynamic parameters for HpMCAT were quantitatively analyzed [23,24]. As shown in Fig. 6A, the change of ellipticity at 220 nm with the increase of temperature demonstrates that the thermal-induced unfolding process of HpMCAT is cooperative and follows a typical two-state pattern. The apparent activation energy (Ea) of the transition of HpMCAT could be obtained according to the following equation [24]: lnðlnð1=F app ÞÞ ¼ Ea =Rð1=T m À 1=T Þ; ð6Þ

where Fapp is defined as the fraction of native protein at the corresponding temperature. Fapp is equal to the (h À hU)/ (hN À hU), h is the observed ellipticity value in 220 nm of HpMCAT at a given temperature, hU and hN are the ellipticity values when the HpMCAT is completely unfolded and in native state, respectively. Tm is the temperature at which the maximum of the heat capacity curve happened. The plot of

3.5. Corytuberine is an uncompetitive inhibitor of HpMCAT It is known that MCAT could catalyze the formation of malonyl-ACP, which is a key substrate for the biosynthesis of fatty acid in bacteria (FAS II). Accordingly, MCAT has been developed as a promising drug target for antibacterial agent discovery. In the current work, we have constructed the high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for the discovery of the potent small molecular inhibitors against HpMCAT based on our natural products library. Up to now, several inhibitors against some other enzymes involved in FAS II process have been investigated. For example, triclosan and diazaborine showed inhibitory activity against the enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) [25­27]. However, no inhibitor has been reported against MCAT enzyme [1,2,28]. In the current work, we firstly discovered a small natural compound, corytuberine (Fig. 1), which demonstrated evidently enzymatic inhibitory activity against HpMCAT and no effects on KDH (data not shown) during the enzymatic inhibition assay. This result thereby indicates that corytuberine is a potent inhibitor against HpMCAT. The IC50 value for this inhibition was evaluated as 33.1 ± 3.29 lM (Fig. 7, inset) by fitting the inhibition data to a dose-dependent curve using a logistic derivative equation. To further elucidate the inhibition mode of corytuberine against HpMCAT, the enzymatic kinetic studies were carried out according to the published methods [20,29]. The results showed that with malonyl-CoA as the variable substrate, corytuberine gave the uncompetitive inhibition pattern with respect to malonyl-CoA according to the double reciprocal plot as shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1. In conclusion, we described the clone and expression of a novel MCAT from H. pylori (HpMCAT), the sequence alignment

Fig. 6. Unfolding analysis of HpMCAT determined by far-UV CD spectra. (A) Thermal-induced unfolding. The ellipticity value at 220 nm of HpMCAT (0.3 mg/ml) was recorded from 20 to 90 °C with the scan rate of 2 °C/min. The inset shows the relationship between the ln(ln(1/Fapp)) and 1/T (Eq. (6)). (B) GndHCl-induced unfolding. The ellipticity value at 220 nm of HpMCAT (0.3 mg/ml) was monitored at the function of GndHCl at 25 °C. The inset reveals the linear relationship between the free energy (DG) and the GndHCl concentrations.

ln(ln(1/Fapp)) versus 1/T showed that they have linear correlation (Fig. 6A, inset). According to Eq. (6), at pH 6.8 the apparent activation energy (Ea) of HpMCAT and Tm were estimated to be 160.1 ± 6.6 (kJ/mol) and 65.5 ± 2.5 °C, respectively. It is known that GndHCl is the most commonly used iondenaturant in the evaluation of protein stability [24]. To investigate the effect of detergent on the stability of HpMCAT, GndHCl-induced unfolding assay for HpMCAT was performed using CD technique. As shown in Fig. 6B, a single transition was observed with increasing GndHCl concentrations from 0.7 to 4 M. On the basis of the experimental data, the GndHCl-induced unfolding could be also described in a two-state pathway, similar to the thermal-induced unfolding nature as indicated in Fig. 6. According to Eqs. (2) and (3), the Cm value (1.3 ± 0.2 M GndHCl), m value (3.58 ± 0.5 kJ/ mol) and DGH2 O of unfolding (4.67 ± 0.7 kJ/mol) could be obtained.

The reaction was performed under the conditions as described in Section 2 in the presence of different concentrations of corytuberine (0, 30, 60, 90 lM) at a range of malonyl-CoA concentrations. The data were analyzed by double reciprocal plot. (Inset: Dose­response curves of enzyme inhibition.)

demonstrated that MCAT is a conserved enzyme among different species. The biochemical characterization and stability investigation of HpMCAT were carried out by CD spectral assay, which provided some useful insights into the understanding of the HpMCAT enzyme. Furthermore, a small molecular natural product, corytuberine, was discovered as a potent inhibitor against HpMCAT. To our knowledge, this is the first MCAT inhibitor to date. Further enzymatic dynamic assay indicated that corytuberine inhibits HpMCAT in an uncompetitive manner. This current work is hoped to supply useful information for better understanding the MCAT features of H. pylori strain and further providing possible hints in the discovery of the antibacterial compounds using HpMCAT as target. The inhibitor, corytuberine, might be used as a potential lead compound in the discovery of antibacterial agents.
