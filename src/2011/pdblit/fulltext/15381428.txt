Department of Chemistry College of Natural Sciences Seoul National University Seoul, 151-742, Korea The Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitor from barley seeds (BBBI) consists of 125 amino acid residues with two inhibitory loops. Its crystal structure in the free state has been determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method and has been re®ned to a crystallographic Ê R-value of 19.1 % for 8.0-1.9 A data. This is the ®rst report on the structure of a 16 kDa double-headed Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI) from monocotyledonous plants and provides the highest resolution picture of a BBI to date. The BBBI structure consists of 11 b-strands and the loops connecting these b-strands but it lacks a-helices. BBBI folds into two compact domains of similar tertiary structure. Each domain shares the same overall fold with 8 kDa dicotyledonous BBIs. The ®ve disul®de bridges in each domain are a subset of the seven disul®de bridges in 8 kDa dicotyledonous BBIs. Two buried water molecules form hydrogen bonds to backbone atoms in the core of each domain. One interesting feature of this two-domain inhibitor structure is that the two P1 residues (Arg17 Ê and Arg76) are approximately 40 A apart, allowing the two reactive-site loops to bind to and to inhibit two trypsin molecules simultaneously and independently. The conformations of the reactive-site loops of BBBI are highly similar to those of other substrate-like inhibitors. This structure provides the framework for modeling of the 1:2 complex between BBBI and trypsin.

Introduction
Plant seeds contain a large number of different types of serine protease inhibitors, which block trypsin and chymotrypsin from animal, fungal, and bacterial origins. Among many types of protease inhibitors from plants, Kunitz-type and Bowman-Birk type inhibitors have been most extensively studied. Members of the Kunitz-type inhibitor family have a molecular mass of about 20 kDa and two disul®de bridges, whereas those of the Bowman-Birk family are smaller (typically $8 kDa or $16 kDa) and richer in disul®de bonds (Birk, 1987). A Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor (BBI) was ®rst isolated from leguminous seeds (Bowman, 1946) and its molecular properties were characterized (Birk et al., 1963). BBIs from dicotyledonous seeds such as soybean are small ($8 kDa), double-headed proteins. That is, the 8 kDa inhibitor contains two reactive sites, each of which

They have attracted much interest due to their anticarcinogenic activity (Kennedy, 1993) and immune-stimulating property (Harms-Ringdahl et al., 1979). Human populations consuming a large amount of BBI in their diet have been shown to exhibit lower rates of colon, breast, prostate, and skin cancers (Birk, 1993). In contrast, monocotyledonous seeds such as barley contain 8 kDa single-headed inhibitors and 16 kDa inhibitors (Prakash et al., 1996). In the evolutionary pathway, it is likely that one of the two reactive-sites of 8 kDa double-headed inhibitors from dicotyledonous seeds became nonfunctional, resulting in the 8 kDa single-headed inhibitors in monocotyledonous seeds (Tashiro et al., 1990). Subsequently, 16 kDa inhibitors such as BBBI might have evolved in monocotyledons by gene duplication. There are no experimental data on the anticarcinogenic property of this inhibitor in the literature. Several trypsin inhibitors are found in various tissues of barley (Mikola & Kirsi, 1972; Ogiso et al., 1975; Boisen & Djurtoft, 1982; Odani et al., 1983; Nagasue et al., 1988). Among them, a 16 kDa trypsin inhibitor puri®ed from the barley rootlet was characterized as a member of BBI family. It is double-headed, since it contains two reactive-sites for inhibiting trypsin in a molar ratio of 1:2. The amino acid sequence of this barley rootlet trypsin inhibitor (BRTI) was determined (Nagasue et al., 1988) and it was found to consist of 124 amino acid residues. BRTI shows an intramolecular sequence identity of 55 % between the amino-terminal half (residues 1-62) and the carboxy-terminal half (residues 63-124). A comparison with soybean Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor (SBBI) indicated that BRTI has two reactive-sites for trypsin at Arg17 and Arg75. Three-dimensional structures of several 8 kDa dicotyledonous BBIs have been reported. They include structures of tracy bean inhibitor PI-II (Chen et al., 1992), peanut inhibitor A-II (Suzuki et al., 1993), soybean inhibitor (Werner & Wemmer, 1992; Voss et al., 1996), and pea seed inhibitor PsTI-IVb (de la Sierra et al., 1999), which have been analyzed in the free form, and those of the inhibitors from adzuki bean (Tsunogae et al., 1986) and mung bean (Lin et al., 1993; Li et al., 1994), which have been determined in complex with trypsin. However, no crystal structure of a 16 kDa BBI from monocots has been reported. It is necessary to compare the tertiary structure of BBIs in cereal grains, a monocot, with those in leguminous plants, a dicot, in order to understand the difference in structure and function, and the evolution of BBIs. Previously, we reported the puri®cation, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic data of the 16 kDa BBI from barley seeds (Song & Suh, 1998b). Here, we have determined its Ê crystal structure in the free state at 1.9 A resolution

by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method (Hendrickson & Ogata, 1997). This is the ®rst report on the three-dimensional structure of a 16 kDa monocotyledonous BBI and, furthermore, it provides the highest resolution picture of a Bowman-Birk-type inhibitor to date. This structure of BBBI provides a basis for modeling studies to gain insight into the interactions between this 16 kDa inhibitor and the target protease.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination and model quality The molecular replacement method was ®rst tried to solve the structure of free BBBI but it failed to yield a solution. Next, the conventional multiple isomorphous replacement method was attempted. An extensive search of heavy-atom derivatives produced, however, only one useful derivative, that of K2PtCl4, possibly due to the scarcity of reactive side-chains in BBBI. The electron density map derived from this Pt-derivative alone was uninterpretable. Therefore, the phase problem was solved using MAD techniques (Hendrickson & Ogata, 1997). The resulting electron density map was readily interpretable in terms of the known chemical amino acid sequence, except that the MADphased electron density clearly indicated that a residue needs to be inserted between Pro41 and Met42 in the reported amino acid sequence (Nagasue et al., 1988). The inserted residue could be identi®ed as serine (Ser101 in Figure 1), which is consistent with the presence of the same residue at the corresponding position in the carboxy-terminal half (designated Ser100 by Nagasue et al., 1988). The discrepancy may be due to the different barley tissues used (the rootlet for sequencing and the seeds for this study) or due to a possible error in the chemical sequencing. Here, Ser42 has been inserted and the residue numbers thereafter are increased by 1. The model accounts for 120 of 125 residues of BBBI and 41 water molecules. It has been re®ned Ê to a crystallographic R-value of 19.1 % for 8.0-1.9 A data with excellent stereochemistry. Missing from the inhibitor model are the three N-terminal residues (Ala1, Gly2, and Lys3) and two C-terminal residues (Pro124 and Arg125) due to missing electron density. The side-chains of Lys8, Lys37, Lys89, and Arg120, mostly in the loop regions, have poor electron density. Among 96 non-glycine and nonproline residues, the numbers of residues lying in the most favored, additionally allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions in the Ramachandran plot are 90 (93.8 %), 6 (6.3 %), 0, and 0, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the re®nement statistics as well as model quality parameters. An average B-factor for the main-chain atoms of each residue in the BBBI model is plotted as a function of residue number in Figure 2. Besides N and C termini, several loops (34, 89-90, 103-107) show

The secondary structure elements of BBBI were assigned by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), while those of SBBI follow the assignment made by Voss et al. (1996). For BBBI, b-strands are labeled sequentially A-F (C is missing) and AH -FH in the N and C domains, respectively, to be consistent with the previous assignment for SBBI.

database of DALI (Holm & Sander, 1993), a notable similarity (Z score > 2.0) was found with tracy bean PI-II inhibitor only (PDB code, 1PI2; Chen et al., 1992), which is an 8 kDa dicotyledonous BBI. The C domain of BBBI is structurally more similar to PI-II than the N domain (C domain versus 1PI2, Z  6.3; N domain versus 1PI2, Z  5.5). In the N domain, each of the two subdomains is formed by an antiparallel b-sheet of three strands (A, B, and F) and another small antiparallel b-sheet of two strands (D and E), respectively. In the C domain, the second subdomain is formed by a small antiparallel b-sheet of three strands (CH , DH , and EH ). The labels of the secondary structure elements in the C domain are primed here for the convenience of discussion. Each domain has approximate Ê Ê Ê dimensions of 38 A Â 22 A Â 20 A. There exist only a few interactions between the two domains; the side-chain oxygen atoms of Asp11 in the N domain make hydrogen bonds to the main-chain nitrogen atom of Arg64 and the side-chain hydroxyl group of Tyr114 in the C domain. The two reactive-sites (Arg17-Ser18 and Arg76-Ser77; P1-P1H ) are located at opposite sides of the inhibitor structure on protruding loops between strands A and B in the N domain (or AH and BH in the C domain). Interestingly, the longest distance between the two P1 residues is approximately Ê 40 A, very similar to the case of the 8 kDa doubleÊ headed BBIs from dicotyledonous seeds (36-40 A). The relative orientation of two domains of BBBI ®rst observed in this structure is much different from the dimeric arrangement in the crystal structure of PsTI-IVb (de la Sierra et al., 1999). A superposition of the two domains of BBBI shows a high degree of similarity for the reactivesite loops and b-strands A and B, but not for the remaining parts (Figure 4(a)). The r.m.s. difference between 59 equivalent Ca atom pairs (for residues 5-63 in the N domain and 64-122 in the C domain) Ê is as large as 2.2 A, while that for each reactive-site loop (13 equivalent Ca atoms for residues 13-25 in

the N domain or residues 72-84 in the C domain) Ê is only 0.50 A. The largest difference occurs around the loops corresponding to the anti-chymotryptic reactive-site loop in 8 kDa (double-headed) BBIs (the regions around Met43 in the N domain and Arg102 in the C domain). These regions show high B-factors for the main-chain atoms (Figure 2), suggesting the inherent conformational ¯exibility of these regions. In the case of the 8 kDa BBIs from leguminous seeds, the ¯exibility of the second reactive-site loop is reduced by the extra disul®de bond. Solvent structure Ê Our BBBI model has been re®ned at 1.9 A, the highest resolution among the reported BBI structures to date, and a total of 41 ordered solvent molecules, all modeled as water, have been located. Most of them are bound to the protein surface. A water molecule (Wat161) forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain oxygen atom (OG) of Ser77 in the reactive-site loop of the C domain (Figure 5(b)). However, it does not seem to affect the reactivesite loop conformation signi®cantly. An equivalent water molecule is not present in either the N domain of BBBI or dicot BBI structures. Thus this

water molecule is not likely to play a signi®cant role in complex formation with the target protease. Two buried water molecules are present as an integral part of each domain (Figure 6). These water molecules are located symmetrically around the intramolecular pseudo 2-fold axis that relates the two subdomains of either the N or the C domain, and each water molecule donates two hydrogen bonds to two peptide C  O groups and accepts one from the peptide N-H group (Figure 6). They show B-factors lower than the average (10.3 Ê and 22.7 A2 for Wat128 and Wat147 in the N Ê domain; 20.7 and 19.9 A2 for Wat131 and Wat141 in the C domain). This suggests that these two water molecules are tightly bound to speci®c pos-

itions within each domain. Similar water molecules have been observed in other 8 kDa dicotyledonous BBI structures (Voss et al., 1996; Lin et al., 1993; Suzuki et al., 1993). They seem to be essential to maintain the tertiary structures of BBIs. Another example of a buried water molecule serving a similar structural role is found in the Kunitz-type soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) family (Onesti et al., 1991; Song & Suh, 1998a), in which a conserved water molecule is present in the center of a triangular structure made up of three b-strands, almost on the pseudo 3-fold axis. Reactive-site loops Each of the two reactive-site loops of BBBI is constrained by a disul®de bridge at their extremities (Cys15-Cys23 in the N domain and Cys74Cys82 in the C domain). When viewed from the direction of Figure 5, the reactive-site loop displays a heart-like shape, as pointed out previously for peanut A-II inhibitor (Suzuki et al., 1993). This characteristic structure is maintained by the polyproline-II conformation at the P3H and P4H positions, and the internal hydrogen bond network involving Thr16 or Thr75 at the P2 position and Ser18 or Ser77 at the P1H position (Figure 5) (Bode & Huber, 1992; Flecker, 1995). In general, the reactive-site loop of a standard mechanism protease inhibitor is relatively ¯exible in its free state and it becomes less mobile upon its

binding to target proteases. This is re¯ected by a remarkable reduction of the atomic B-factors of the reactive-site loop upon complexation, which is not accompanied by any signi®cant structural change in the reactive-site loop. Such behavior has been observed for the reactive-site loops of A-II (Suzuki et al., 1993) and other inhibitors (Read & James, 1986; Song & Suh, 1998a). However, the overall B-factor of the reactive-site loops of BBBI is relatively low even in the free state (Figure 2). This may be partly contributed by the stabilization of the reactive-site loops through intermolecular contacts with the symmetry-related molecules in the crystal. These contacts involve direct hydrogen Ê bonds (Cys15 (P3) O Á Á ÁN Arg102#, 3.0 A; Arg17 Ê (P1) NÁ Á ÁO Pro100#, 2.6 A; Cys74 (P3) O Á Á ÁOE1 Ê Gln52#, 3.2 A). However, the conformations of the two reactive-site loops of BBBI are not affected signi®cantly by the crystal packing, as evidenced by the lack of any signi®cant deviation when they are compared with those of other BBI structures (see below). Comparison of inhibitor structures The alignment of amino acid sequences of several BBIs is shown in Figure 1(a). The sequence identity among monocotyledonous BBIs is higher

1139 Table 2, which lists the r.m.s. differences for nine Ca atom pairs (P3-P6H ). Table 2 gives the results for comparing the inhibitor structures in the free and complexed states. When the reactive-site loops of the N and C domains are compared, the r.m.s. Ê deviation is 0.46 A. Superpositions of the BBBI reactive-site loops in the N and C domains with the corresponding loop in SBBI, a prototypic dicotyledonous BBI, give r.m.s. differences of 0.24 and Ê 0.40 A (Table 2). When the free BBBI is compared with BBIs in complex with trypsin (AB-I and Mab in Table 2), the r.m.s. deviations are between Ê Ê 0.22 A and 0.40 A. This indicates that the conformations of the reactive-site loops of different BBIs are highly similar and are little affected by complex formation. When Ca atoms of P2-P3H residues of BBBI are superposed with the corresponding atoms of other Ê inhibitors, the r.m.s. deviations are 0.80 A for BPTI Ê for STI (PDB code (PDB code 4PTI), 0.66 A Ê 1AVW), and 0.96 A for OMTKY3 (PDB code 1CHO), respectively (Figure 7(b)). Therefore, the conformations of the central portions of the inhibitory loops are very similar. In contrast, the conformations outside the P2-P3H residues can be much different among the inhibitors. The extension of the reactive-site loop of BBI family members (as measured by the distance between Ca atoms of Ê residues P3 and P4H ) is among the smallest (5.8 A Ê for SBBI), compared with for BBBI and 5.9 A Ê Ê 15.1 A for BPTI (Kunitz family), 10.3 A for STI Ê (STI-Kunitz family), 13.8 A for MCTI (squash Ê family), 13.5 A for OMTKY3 (Kazal family), and Ê for eglin c (PI-1 family). This narrow reac15.2 A tive-site loop, instead of an extended conformation, is a consequence of the cis-proline residue at the P3H position in BBI family members (Figure 1) (Tsunogae et al., 1986). The reactive-site loops of different classes of inhibitors are stabilized in different ways. The reactive-site loops of BPTI (Kunitz), Kazal, squash, PI-1, and BBI families are constrained at their extremities by disul®de bridges that could limit their conformational freedom. No disul®de bridge adjacent to the reactive-site is present in STI or eglin c (PI-1 family). In the case of STI, the reactive-site loop is held in an inhibitory conformation by an extensive hydrogen bond network involving the conserved residue Asn13. The conformation of the reactive-site loops of BBBI is also stabilized by the hydrogen bonding network

than 50 %, whereas that between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous BBIs ranges between 30 and 33 %. BBBI shows an intramolecular sequence identity of 55 % between the N and C domains. As shown in Figure 1(a), the reactive-site loops (residues Cys15-Cys23 and Cys74-Cys82) are the most conserved regions of BBI sequences. Disul®de bridges are also well conserved; the ®ve disul®de bridges in each domain of 16 kDa monocotyledonous BBIs are a subset of the seven in 8 kDa dicotyledonous BBIs. Among the two missing disul®de bridges (Cys12-Cys58 and Cys41-Cys49 in SBBI sequence), the latter constrains the anti-chymotryptic reactive-site loop in 8 kDa double-headed BBIs from dicotyledonous plants. The loss of this disul®de bond in BBBI may be partly responsible for the inactivity of its corresponding loop in each domain. The N domain of the BBBI model is superposed with its C domain and the whole molecule of SBBI in Figure 4(b). It can be seen that the structural variability is greater for the regions that are not involved in protease recognition. Large deviations in these regions (residues 40-49 and 99-108 in the N and C domains, respectively) are due to the loss of disul®de bridges and to high B-factors (Figure 2). Therefore, they are more divergent in tertiary structure as well as in primary structure among BBIs. The results of a disul®de-deletion analysis of the trypsin-reactive subdomain of SBBI pointed to the signi®cance of the polar subdomain interface as a major refolding determinant (Philipp et al., 1998). Arg28 and His33 of SBBI, which have been suggested to be responsible for inter-subdomain effects observed in a disul®de-deletion in SBBI, are replaced by non-polar residues in BBBI (Val29 and Pro33 in the N domain; Val88 and Ala92 in the C domain). And, consequently, the conformational distortions due to the missing disul®de bond (corresponding to Cys41-Cys49 in SBBI) are expected to be restricted to the subdomains around Met43 and Arg102 in BBBI (corresponding to Leu43 in SBBI). Despite large overall structural variations among BBIs, the inhibitory-loop regions show a highly similar conformation. And the magnitude of the deviations is roughly what is expected from the estimated coordinate errors. For a detailed comparison of the inhibitory loop conformations, six BBI models are superposed in Figure 7(a) and the results of the superpositions are summarized in

formed by the P2 threonine residue in each domain (Figure 5). In short, the central portions (P2-P3H ) of the reactive loops in the above inhibitors have very similar main-chain conformations despite large structural differences elsewhere. Interactions with trypsin molecules A single polypeptide chain of this doubleheaded inhibitor can bind up to two molecules of trypsin. In order to understand the interactions between the inhibitor and trypsin, modeling studies were undertaken. The inhibitory loop of the N domain is most similar to Mab, while that of the C domain is most similar to AB-I (Table 2). Therefore, the trypsin molecules bound to BBBI have been modeled assuming that they bind to the inhibitor in a manner similar to that observed in the crystal structures of the Mab:bovine pancreatic trypsin (BPT) complex (Li et al., 1994) or the AB-I:BPT complex (Tsunogae et al., 1986). The two trypsins will be referred to as E (interacting with the N domain) and F (interacting with the C domain), respectively. The hypothetical model of the BBBI:BPT complex was further optimized by the program MULTIDOCK (Jackson et al., 1998) and manual adjustments of a few side-chains. The results of modeling studies indicate that each of the two exposed reactive-site loops of BBBI readily slot into the active-site cleft of BPT (Figure 8). In our model of the 1:2 complex, bound trypsin molecules come very close, making slight contacts with each other. One side of a trypsin molecule (Ser170E and Pro173E) makes van der Waals con-

tacts with the other side of another trypsin molecule (Ser147F, Gly148F, and Thr149F) (Figure 8). There is no hydrogen bond interaction between the two trypsin molecules. It is interesting to note that the two P1 residues (Arg17 and Arg76) are Ê approximately 40 A apart in this two-domain inhibitor structure, allowing the two reactive-site loops to bind to and to inhibit two trypsin molecules simultaneously and independently. It has been suggested that a minimum distance requirement between the two binding sites of 8 kDa double-headed BBIs for simultaneously binding Ê two protease molecules is 39 A (de la Sierra et al., 1999). However, the relative spatial orientations of two protease molecules bound to double-headed BBIs from dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous seeds are markedly different (Figure 3). This is because the two reactive-site loops in 8 kDa double-headed dicotyledonous BBIs are related by a pseudo 2-fold axis relating the two subdomains, whereas those in 16 kDa double-headed BBBI are not. Most of the contacts between BBBI and BPT involve six residues (P4-P2H ) in the reactive-site loops. And the mode of interaction is very similar to other BBI:protease complexes (Tsunogae et al., 1986; Lin et al., 1993; Li et al., 1994; de la Sierra et al., 1999; Luckett et al., 1999). In our hypothetical model, each of the P1 residues (Arg17 and Arg76) makes the most extensive hydrogen bonds with BPT and its side-chain atoms occupy their expected positions in the primary binding pocket of BPT (S1 pocket). The guanidium group of P1 residues makes an ionic interaction with the carboxylate

1141 stretch of BBBI (residues Pro120, Arg121, Cys122, and Thr123; Pro124 and Arg125 are missing from our model) makes contact with trypsin molecule E (Figure 8(a)). The major interacting residues in trypsin E are Glu186 and Lys222, respectively. The C-terminal tail of the pea seed inhibitor, PsTI-IVb, also makes contact with the trypsin molecule in the model of the PsTI-IVb:trypsin:chymotrypsin ternary complex (de la Sierra et al., 1999). However, the isoform PsTI-II displays the same KM value for trypsin as PsTI-IVb, despite the missing C-terminal tail. In the crystal structure of the AB-I:trypsin complex, only the peptide 55-63 of the inhibitor was visible in the electron density map and thus it is not clear whether the C-terminal tail interacts with trypsin (Tsunogae et al., 1986). Therefore, a structural analysis of the complex is necessary to delineate more precisely the role of the C-terminal tail of BBBI in trypsin binding.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of Pt-derivative crystals Figure 8. A hypothetical model for the 1:2 complex between BBBI and two trypsin molecules. (a) The backbone model of BBBI (green tubes) and the electrostatic potential surface of trypsin molecules. (b) The backbone model of trypsins (magenta tubes) and the electrostatic potential surface of BBBI. The view in (b) is obtained by a 180  rotation of (a) around a horizontal axis. Positively charged regions are blue and negatively charged regions are red. The N and C-terminal and P1 residues in BBBI and the catalytic triad (Asp102-His57-Ser195) in trypsin are labeled. This Figure was generated using GRASP (Nicholls, 1992). Puri®cation, crystallization, and X-ray data collection of native BBBI have been reported (Song & Suh, 1998b). The Pt-derivative for MAD phasing (Hendrickson & Ogata, 1997) was prepared as follows. A crystal was soaked at a ®nal concentration of 2.5 mM K2PtCl4 for six days in the hanging drop where it had grown. The crystal turned brown when derivatized. For the MAD data collection, the derivative crystal was equilibrated in the cryoprotectant solution (reservoir solution (23 % PEG 3 K, 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.23) plus 20 % glycerol for a few minutes). The crystal was then ¯ash-frozen in the nitrogen gas stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK) for data collection. Upon ¯ash-freezing, the lengths of a and c axes were decreased by about 0.5 and Ê 1.5 A, respectively (Table 3).

group of Asp189 in each BPT. P1 carbonyl carbon atoms are in the ``sub-van der Waals'' distances Ê from trypsin Ser195 OG atom (2.90 and 2.60 A, respectively). Extensive mutagenesis studies on the P2 and P2H positions of BBI showed that a threonine residue at the P2 position provides an optimal inhibition and the best residue at the P2H position is isoleucine (McBride et al., 1998; Gariani et al., 1999). All available sequences of BBIs showed that this threonine residue at the P2 position is highly conserved (Figure 1(a)). In BBBI, the P2 residues are Thr16 and Thr75, respectively. They form the hydrogen bond network that maintains the characteristic conformation of the inhibitory loops. Our modeling study shows that the P2H residues (Ile19 and Asn78) make the second most signi®cant interactions with trypsin next to the P1 residues. This is consistent with the suggestion that the P2H residue is important in determining the speci®city of the inhibitor towards its cognate enzyme (Gariani et al., 1999). In addition to the reactive-site, a C-terminal

MAD data collection and structure determination Ê MAD data were collected to 2.2 A from a Pt-derivative crystal at 100 K on an ADSC Quantum 4R detector at the beamline X8-C of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. The data were Ê collected at three wavelengths: 1.07127 A (``peak'', maxiÊ mum of f HH ), 1.07159 A (``edge'', maximum of j fH j), and Ê 1.04192 A (``remote''). The inverse beam geometry was used for measuring Bijvoet pairs simultaneously. All data were reduced and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). This set of threewavelength MAD data were collected within six hours. A single pt site was located by the program SOLVE (Terwilliger & Berendzen, 1999; http://www.solve.lanl.gov). For scaling and subsequent steps, the remote wavelength data were chosen as the ``native'' data set (Ramakrishnan & Biou, 1997). Heavy-atom parameters were further re®ned with SHARP (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997) and initial MAD phases were improved by solvent-¯attening and histogram matching with DM (CCP4, 1994). A summary of X-ray data collection and phasing statistics is given in Table 3.

Model building and refinement Ê The MAD-phased electron density map at 2.5 A resolution was of suf®cient quality to allow building of a nearly complete model using O (Jones et al., 1991). The identi®cation of ten disul®de bridges was helpful in connecting secondary structural elements. The Pt atom bound to the sulfur atom of Met26 was also clearly visible. Phases computed from the partially re®ned models were combined with the experimental MAD phases in each cycle of re®nement using SIGMAA (CCP4, 1994). The model was initially re®ned against the remote waveÈ length data with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). Atomic positions were re®ned by the conventional conjugate gradient minimization, with higher resolution data to Ê 2.5 A being added in steps. After a round of simulated annealing re®nement employing the standard slow-cooling protocol, the model was subject to re®nement against native2 data (Table 3), extending the high-resolution Ê limit to 1.9 A in steps. Individual isotropic B-factors, Ê initially set to 20 A2, were re®ned in the last stages of the re®nement with restraint. Solvent molecules were placed by searching the model-phased (Fo À Fc) maps and a bulk solvent correction was applied. A summary of the re®nement statistic is given in Table 1. Structure analysis The stereochemistry of the model was assessed with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Models were displayed with O (Jones et al., 1991) and CHAIN (Sack, 1988). Model superpositions were done by LSQKAB in CCP4 (CCP4, 1994). The putative complex model was built by the superposition of reactive-site loops based on the trypsin-inhibitor complex structures (PDB codes 1TAB and 1SMF) and was further optimized by the program MULTIDOCK (Jackson et al., 1998). To analyze the protein-protein interface of the BPT-BBBI complex model we used the protein-protein interaction server (Jones &

Thornton, 1996; http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/ PP/server). The DALI server was used for searching structural homology (Holm & Sander, 1993; http:// www2.ebi.ac.uk/dali).
