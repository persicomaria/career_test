Abstract--Metallo-b-lactamases (MBLs) catalyze the hydrolysis of b-lactams including penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. Starting from benzohydroxamic acid (1) structure-activity studies led to the identification of selective inhibitors of the FEZ-1 MBL, e.g., 2,5-substituted benzophenone hydroxamic acid 17 has a Ki of 6.1 ± 0.7 lM against the FEZ-1 MBL but does not significantly inhibit the IMP-1, BcII, CphA or L1 MBLs.

b-Lactamases can be classified into those employing a nucleophilic serine (classes A, C and D) and those binding one or two zinc ions (the metallo-b-lactamases, MBLs, class B) at their active site. To date, medical attention has focused on the serine active BLs and inhibitors of these enzymes are widely used. However, MBLs hydrolyse most b-lactam antibiotics and represent a growing clinical threat (for review, see Refs. 1,2). MBL sub-classes B1 and B3 display a broad substrate selectivity, whereas sub-class B2 are reported to efficiently hydrolyse only carbapenems.3,4 Sub-class B1 MBLs, including BcII (Bacillus cereus) and IMP-1 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), accept b-lactam substrates with one or two active site Zn(II) ions, whereas B3 MBLs, e.g., FEZ-1 (Legionella gormanii) and GOB-1 (Chryseobacterium meningosepticum), are only active with two Zn(II) ions. The B2 sub-class MBL CphA (Aeromonas hydrophilia) is only active as a monozinc protein and is noncompetitively inhibited by the presence of a second Zn(II).5 MBL inhibitors can be classified into those containing thiols (e.g., thiomandelic acid,6 D -captopril,7 6-(mercaptomethyl)penicillinates8 and homocysteinyl peptides9) and non-thiol-containing compounds (e.g., trifluoromethylketones,10 hydroxamic acids,11 biphenyl tetrazoles,12 N-arylsulfonyl hydrazones13 and 2,3-disubstituted succinic acids14). Notably, only thiomandelate

has been reported to inhibit (non-selectively) FEZ-1 with a Ki value of 0.27 lM.6 Despite similarities in its overall fold, crystallographic analyses indicate that the active site of the FEZ-1 MBL is significantly different to that of other sub-class B3 MBLs,15 possibly reflecting difficulties in obtaining inhibitors for it. To demonstrate that FEZ-1 inhibitors can be prepared, and with the aim of understanding differences between FEZ-1 and other MBLs, efforts were made to identify non-thiol FEZ-1 inhibitors. We report the identification and synthesis of benzophenone hydroxamic acids as FEZ-1 selective inhibitors. Initial studies, based on the screening of a set of small molecules bearing potential metal binding chelation functions, led to the observation that benzohydroxamic acid (1, Fig. 1) inhibited FEZ-1 (55% of inhibition at 100 lM under standard assay conditions), but did not inhibit IMP-1, BcII and CphA. Furthermore, 1 did not inhibit the L1 MBL, which, like FEZ-1, is from sub-class B3. The synthesis of derivatives of 1 was then carried out to identify more potent FEZ-1 inhibitors. Hydroxybenzohydroxamic acids (2a­c) were prepared from the corresponding hydroxybenzoic acids in five steps (in overall yields of 17­52%; see supporting information) and screened for inhibition against IMP-1, BcII, CphA, L1 and FEZ-1. Compounds 2a­c inhibited FEZ-1 with ca. 45%, 64% and 53% inhibition observed in the standard assay. Hydroxamic acids 3 and 4 did not significantly (<10%) inhibit FEZ-1 nor the other tested MBLs, arguing against the non-specific inhibition of FEZ-1 by

Zn(II) complexation in solution. Solution kinetics with FEZ-1 revealed competitive inhibition for the most potent inhibitor 2b with a Ki of 17.9 ± 0.7 lM. Since a meta-hydroxyl substituent on the phenyl ring appeared to somewhat enhance the inhibition against FEZ-1 (from 55% inhibition for 1 to 64% for 2b) whilst retaining selectivity, dihydroxy-derivatives of 2b were targeted. Compounds 5a­d (Fig. 1) were synthesized via a similar route used for 2a­c (see supporting information). Despite retaining FEZ-1 selectivity, the presence of an additional hydroxyl group at the C-2 (5a), C-4 (5b) or C-6 (5d) positions on the aromatic ring resulted in an apparent reduction in potency compared to 2b. However, 3,5-dihydroxylated compound 5c (Ki = 13.3 ± 1.0 lM) had about the same potency as 2b (17.9 ± 0.7 lM) and was FEZ-1-selective. The apparent slight increase in the potency on derivatization at C-5 prompted the investigation of further 3-hydroxy-5substituted benzohydroxamic acids. 5-Amidobenzohydroxamic acids 6a­e and 5-carboxybenzohydroxamic acid 7 were prepared from dimethyl ester 8, in seven steps and in overall yields of 26­57% for 6a­e and in six steps and 41% yield for 7 (Scheme 1). Thus, methyl isophthalate 8 was alkylated with allyl bromide to give ether 9. Mono-saponification of the methyl isophthalate ester 9 to generate 10 was followed by EDCI/HOBt-mediated coupling of O-benzylhydroxylamine HCl to afford 11. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester of 11 afforded carboxylic acid 12 which was then coupled with aromatic, aliphatic and cyclic amines to afford benzamides 13a­e. Deprotection of allyl ethers 13a­e catalyzed by tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) gave phenols 14a­e, which were converted by palladium-catalyzed-hydrogenolysis to the target hydroxamic acids 6a­e. Starting from protected benzohydroxamic acid 11, palladium-mediated allyl deprotection afforded phenol 15, which was followed by methyl ester hydrolysis to give 16, and palladium-catalyzed hydrogenolysis afforded 7. Benzophenone hydroxamic acid 17 was prepared from dimethyl ester 18, in 10 steps and overall yield of 8% (Scheme 2). Dimethyl ester 18 was mono-saponified using KOH in DMSO to give monomethyl ester 19. Formation of acid chloride 20 (SOCl2), followed by Friedel­ Crafts acylation, afforded benzophenone 21 (para/ortho regioselectivity, 96:4). Methyl ester 21 (as an para/ortho mixture) was hydrolysed to give 22 and then demethylat-

Strikingly, when the 5-hydroxyl group of compound 5c was replaced by a benzoyl moiety to generate benzophenone hydroxamate 17, FEZ-1 was inhibited by 85% compared with the absence of inhibitor. Moreover, 17 remained selective for FEZ-1, with no significant inhibition detected against IMP-1, BcII, CphA or even L1. The Ki value for 17 of 6.1 ± 0.7 lM represents a three fold increase in potency compared to 2b without reduction of selectivity. A significant drop of inhibitory activity was observed for carboxylate 23a with ca. 33% of inhibition compared to hydroxamate 17 (85%). This result indicates that the hydroxamic acid function is important for efficient FEZ-1 inhibition (probably via interactions with the Zn(II) ion(s)) and that the benzophenone core may interact favourably with FEZ-1.

DMF gave triallyl-protected benzophenone 24, and saponification of the allyl ester afforded carboxylic acid 25. Generation of benzyl-protected hydroxamic acid 26 was accomplished using the EDCI/HOBt-mediated coupling of O-benzylhydroxylamine HCl in CH2Cl2. Deprotection, first with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (to give 27) and then 10% palladium(0) on charcoal and H2 gave 17. Replacement of the 5-hydroxyl group of 5c with a carboxylate (7) almost removed activity versus FEZ-1 (Table 1). However, amide derivatives of 7 (6a­e) retained some potency versus FEZ-1 with 58% (6a), 54% (6b), 36% (6c), 34% (6d) and 53% (6e) inhibition being observed in the standard assay. These observations prompted investigation into alternative hydrophobic more rigid aromatic derivatives such as in benzophenones 17 and 23a.

Figure 3. (a) Highest GOLD score docking conformation representing the possible binding mode of 17 to FEZ-1 (PDB code 1K07);15 (b) view from the crystal structure of aminopeptidase(ZnII)2-para-iodo-D -phenylalanine hydroxamate (PDB code 1IGB).19 The similarity of the hydroxamateZn(II) interactions between the docked FEZ-1(ZnII)2-17 and the crystal structure of aminopeptidase(ZnII)2-PIPAH complexes is highlighted. Factors that may contribute to the proposed binding mode of FEZ-1(ZnII)2-17 include electrostatic interactions between the hydroxamic acid of 17 and the Zn(II) ions, hydrogen bonding between Tyr156 and C-3 hydroxyl groups of 17, hydrogen bonding between the Lys297 side chain and the C-11 hydroxyl group of 17 and hydrophobic interactions between Pro226 and 17 (see supporting information for additional views).

To investigate the binding of compound 17 to FEZ-1, soft ionization electrospray mass spectrometry (ESIMS) experiments were carried out (Fig. 2a). Peaks at ca. 29,435 Da (A) and ca. 29,567 Da (B) were observed; they correspond to FEZ-1(ZnII)2 and FEZ1(ZnII)2 + methionine (met-FEZ-1(ZnII)2) complexes, respectively. The assignment of the N-terminal ± Met residue was confirmed by tryptic digests followed by MALDI-MS analyses. Enzyme­inhibitor complexes were not observed for the less potent inhibitors 1, 2b and 5c, but one molecule of 17 was observed to bind to FEZ-1 (Fig. 2b) corresponding to a mass shift of ca. 270 Da relative to the unliganded enzyme; in agreement with the MW of 17 (273 Da). The complex of 17 with FEZ-1 was not detected upon increasing the sample cone from 80 V (Fig. 2b) to 120 V (Fig. 2c), indicative of non-covalent binding. Although there are caveats with respect to conformational changes and metal ligation, docking analyses of 17 using GOLD,17 which has been previously used with MBLs,18 gave 10 conformations with seven displaying identical binding modes to FEZ-1 (Fig. 3a). The predicted interactions between the carbonyl and hydroxyl oxygen atoms of the hydroxamate of 17 with the FEZ-1 Zn(II) ions are similar to the crystallographically observed interactions in the complex of a dizinc-dependent aminopeptidase (Fig. 3b) and para-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate.19 The benzophenone core of 17 is predicted to adopt a twisted shape around Pro226, apparently maximizing the interaction with the benzophenone carbonyl and the aromatic C-4 of 17. This interaction may explain the lack of FEZ-1 activity for 3, 4 and 7 since the presence of a negatively charged carboxylate function at C-5 may be incompatible with Pro226. In contrast, compounds

with more hydrophobic functionalities at C-5 (e.g., 6a­e and 23a) may be more suited for interaction with Pro226 leading to an increase in potency. Comparison of the predicted binding mode for 17 with FEZ-1 MBL, with crystal structures of wildtype BcII and CphA (see supporting information), suggests that the much narrower active sites of BcII and CphA may hinder binding of the para-hydroxybenzoyl substituent of compound 17 possibly rationalizing the reason for the lack of inhibition of 17 against IMP-1, BcII, CphA and L1.
