However, continuously increasing resistance towards approved drugs inevitably requires the development of new inhibitors preferably showing no susceptibility against resistant HIV protease strains. Recently, symmetric pyrrolidine-3,4-bis-N-benzyl-sulfonamides have been developed as a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors. The most promising candidate exhibited a Ki of 74 nM towards a wild-type protease. Herein, we report the influence of the active-site mutations Ile50Val and Ile84Val on these inhibitors by structural and kinetic analysis. Although the Ile50Val mutation leads to a significant decrease in affinity for all compounds in this series, they retain or even show increased affinity towards the important Ile84Val mutation. By detailed analysis of the crystal structures of two representatives in complex with wild-type and mutant proteases, we were able to elucidate the structural basis of this phenomenon.

Introduction
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease is a well-established target for the development of antiviral therapeutics.1 The protease processes the gag- and gagpol-encoded polyproteins into functional enzymes that are essential for the viral replication.2 Inhibition of the viral protease leads to immature noninfectious virions.3 Currently, nine HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.4 The highly active antiretroviral therapy, which combines protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors, not only significantly prolongs but also improves the quality of the patient's life.5,6 However, an entire remedy of the infection still remains an unaccomplished goal. Moreover, although most of the

inhibitors initially exhibit a strong inhibitory effect, this efficacy decreases over time due to the continuously new formation of drug-resistant virus variants. The relatively low fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase and the fast replication rate are the main driving factors for the high mutation rate of the HIV. It has been estimated that up to 105 point mutations occur daily within the viral population of an infected individual.7 Due to high mutation rates, there are several nonidentical genomes termed viral quasispecies, hence making it difficult to define one wild-type protease as reference point.8 The following studies were performed using a clone of the BH10 isolate. Mutations in the binding pocket as well as in distal sites of the HIV protease affect inhibitor and substrate binding by altering the number and strength of subsite interactions. Since the applied inhibitors effectively inhibit wild-type proteases and limit wild-type duplication, they also provide a selective advantage to those HIV variants with reduced susceptibility. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant HIV variants diminishing the efficacy of all PIs in clinical use hampers an effective antiviral treatment of patients infected by these variants. Under selective drug pressure, mutations have been

proven to occur nearly in one-half of the HIV-1 protease amino acid positions.9 The mutations can generally be classified into major and minor ones.10 Major mutations are initially selected by drug treatment and mainly occur at residues forming interactions upon drug binding. Minor mutations consecutively improve the replicative fitness of virus variants carrying major mutations. The high adaptability of the virus demands a continuous and persistent search for new inhibitors. Novel inhibitors should exhibit a different mutation profile compared to that of the marketed drugs to circumvent the development of cross-resistance. Most of the currently approved inhibitors are transitionstate mimics targeting the catalytic aspartates 25A and 25B via a secondary hydroxyl group. As an alternative skeleton, cyclic amines have been proposed as novel anchoring groups.11 Very recently, we have described the design and synthesis of C2-symmetric 3,4-disubstituted pyrrolidines as a new class of HIV-1 PIs. The co-crystal structures of six derivatives were determined in complex with wild-type HIV-1 protease {compound [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID]: 1 (2PQZ), 3 (2QNP), 6 (2QNQ), 8 (2PWC), 9 (2PWR), 10 (2QNN); Table 2} and further utilized within a structure-guided optimization process.12 These crystal structures revealed a conserved binding mode for all investigated derivatives, schematically represented in Fig. 1: The endocyclic amino function addresses the catalytic dyad and a unique flap interaction pattern is observed. Only one sulfonyl group of the C2-symmetric inhibitor is involved in two hydrogen bonds to the backbone NHs of Ile50A and Ile50B each formed by one of the sulfonyl oxygen atoms. The second sulfonyl group remains uncoordinated and establishes no polar contacts. This leads to an overall slightly asymmetric binding mode of the C2-symmetric inhibitors. However, each symmetry-related subpocket is occupied by the corresponding symmetry-related substituent of the inhibitor. For the wildtype protease, the co-crystal

structure of the most potent derivative (compound 10)12 is shown together with the co-crystal structures of all currently approved HIV PIs in Fig. 2 [inhibitor (PDB ID): ritonavir (1HXW),13 atazanavir (2AQU),14 darunavir (1T3R),15 amprenavir (1HPV),16 indinavir (1HSG),17 nelfinavir (1OHR),18 saquinavir (1HXB),19 lopinavir (2O4S),20 and tipranavir (2O4P)20]. This comparison reveals a completely different mode in targeting the protease's subsites by this new class of inhibitors: Whereas the approved inhibitors bind to the subsites successively from S3 to S3, the pyrrolidinebased inhibitors occupy the S1­S3/S2 and the S1­ S3/S2 pockets via the two substituents at the pyrrolidine ring, respectively. This leads to a unique binding mode in the active site, particularly at the borders of the S1/S2 and the S1/S2 pockets, composed of the amino acids Ile50 and Ile84 of chain A and B. Both residues are referred to as major mutations. Whereas the Ile84Val mutation in HIV-1 protease is associated with resistance to all approved inhibitors, the Ile50Val mutation is mainly linked to the resistance against amprenavir.21 Due to their importance and the remarkable differences in binding of the pyrrolidine-based inhibitors, particularly in the contact area next to Ile50 and Ile84, we selected these two mutations for further investigations. Both mutations have already been studied extensively by kinetic measurements,22,23 structural biology,24,25 isothermal calorimetry,26,27 and computational methods.28 These studies attribute the reduced affinity with respect to the Ile84Val mutant primarily to the loss of van der Waals contacts with the P1/P1 moieties of the inhibitors. The sensitivity of amprenavir towards the Ile50Val mutation is attributed to strong interactions of the C of Ile50A with the P2 residue of the inhibitor.26 Encouraged by the deviating and up to now unique mode in which the C2-symmetric pyrrolidine-based inhibitors bind to the protease's subsites, we investigated their potential against these drug-resistant mutations. The two active-site mutants Ile50Val and

Ile84Val were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Followed by kinetic studies, two representatives (compounds 8 and 9) were crystallized in complex with the wild-type and the two corresponding mutant proteases. Throughout this article, the wild-type protease (BH10 isolate) is referred to as PRWT and the mutant proteases are referred to as PRI50V and PRI84V.

the contrasting behavior of the inhibitors towards the single point mutants PRI50V and PRI84V, we determined the co-crystal structures of two derivatives in complex with the mutant proteases. Due to the largest relative difference in affinity towards the mutants, along with good potency, compounds 8 and 9 were selected, possessing deviating P2/P2 substituents. Structural analysis The amino (8) and carboxamido (9) derivatives were crystallized in complex with the PRI50V and PRI84V variants. The crystallographic data and refinement statistics of the four structures are listed in Table 3. All co-crystal structures discussed within this study crystallized, with identical packing, in the space group P21212 with very similar lattice constants. Therefore, an influence of crystal packing on the observed differences can be neglected. In the space group P21212, the asymmetric unit contains the HIV-1 protease with two symmetry-independent chains labeled as 1A to 99A and 1B to 99B, respectively. The collected data sets have comparable quality with resolutions between 1.58 and 1.92 Å. In all cases, the ligand geometries were clearly visible in the Fo - Fc omit map at a  level of 3.0 (Fig. 3) and could be refined as one single conformer. All structures were determined by molecular replacement and consecutively refined following the same protocol. Crystal structures of compound 8 The crystal structures of the amino derivative (compound 8) in complex with the HIV protease variants were determined with a resolution of 1.58 Å (PRI50V) and 1.92 Å (PRI84V), respectively. Both complexes exhibit a high level of similarity to the corresponding wild-type complex (determined at a resolution of 1.78 Å) studied previously.12 This similarity is reflected by the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between the C atoms of 0.12 Å for PRI50V and 0.18 Å for PRI84V compared to the PRWT complex. Using the C-based alignment, the ligand geometries also show a high level of similarity with an rmsd of 0.19 Å for the PRI50V and 0.28 Å for the PRI84V in comparison to the PRWT ligand coordinates (Fig. 4a). The overall binding mode is conserved and schematically represented in Fig. 5a; the distances of polar contacts are given in

Results
Kinetic characterization In order to estimate the consequences of the point mutations to putative natural substrates, the kinetic parameters of PRWT, PRI50V, and PRI84V were determined in a fluorescence-based assay (Table 1) using four different commercially available substrates. The four fluorescence substrates were purchased from Bachem (substrates A and B) and Sigma-Aldrich (substrates C and D). PRI50V and PRI84V exhibited a significantly reduced Km to all studied substrates compared to PRWT. For PRI50V, the affinity towards the substrates is reduced 10fold, whereas for PRI84V, an affinity reduction by a factor of 5 was determined. The reduced catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) is driven by this loss in affinity of the mutant proteases towards these substrates. The affinities of the pyrrolidine-based inhibitors were determined towards the protease variants using substrate A, and the results are summarized in Table 2. In the case of the Ile50Val mutation, on average, a decrease in affinity of the pyrrolidinebased inhibitors by a factor of 5 is observed. This overall decrease in affinity seems therefore to occur as a general phenomenon of this class of compounds and not as a result of a special substitution pattern. In contrast, the pyrrolidine-based inhibitors exhibit an equal or even improved affinity towards the Ile84Val mutant: Pyrrolidine 1 exhibits a twofold increase in affinity. Compounds with only one additional hydrophobic substituent at the P1/P1 aromatic rings (compounds 2, 3, and 4) at least retain their affinity, whereas all other derivatives carrying additional polar or hydrophobic substituents at the P2/P2 moieties exhibit significantly improved potency. Particularly for the amide-substituted derivatives (compounds 9 and 10), an up to sevenfold increase in affinity towards this drugresistant point mutant is observed. To investigate

Table 4. The pivotal nitrogen of the pyrrolidine core structure interacts with the catalytic dyad. In the case of the wild-type complex, the nitrogen atom is in close contact with the carboxylic oxygen atoms of Asp25A and Asp25B. This important interaction is conserved for the mutant proteases. The flap interactions formed via hydrogen bonds of the sulfonyl oxygens to the main-chain NH of Ile50A and Ile50B or Val50A and Val50B are comparable in all complexes. The inhibitor's benzyl moieties occupy the S1 and S1 pockets whereas the pamino-phenyl sulfonamide groups bind in the S2 and S2 pockets. The amino substituents form a hydrogen-bond network, which, due to the asymmetric binding mode, differs in S2 and S2. The observed polar interactions in S2 are highly conserved: The amino group hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Asp30B and, mediated via a water molecule, to the corresponding side-chain carboxyl oxygen atom. In the S2 pocket,

differences are noticed: The water-mediated interaction to the carboxyl function of Asp29A is only observed in PRWT and PRI50V, whereas the H-bond to the side chain of Asp30A is conserved in all complexes. In PRWT and PRI50V, the C atoms of Ile84A and Ile84B are in close van der Waals contact to the benzylic methylene groups of the ligand (PRWT, 3.5/3.3 Å; PRI50V, 3.6/3.4 Å), compared to C of the corresponding Val84A and Val84B in PRI84V (3.8/4.0 Å). The burial of the ligand surface varies slightly between 95% and 96%, exhibiting the highest value in the PRWT complex. The most pronounced differences are observed in the PRI84V complex: The Ile84Val exchange at the border of the S1/S2 pockets enlarges the binding site, and the newly created additional space is filled by a water molecule (O3083, Fig. 5b). This water mediates polar interactions between one oxygen atom of the sulfonyl group of compound 8 and the main-chain carbonyl of Val82A and the side chain of

The binding pockets of the three structures were consecutively analyzed with a water probe using the program GRID to evaluate whether the position of the additional water is energetically favorable. In Fig. 6c, the GRID interaction fields for the PRI84V binding pocket are displayed. A contour is observed at the position of the additionally enclosed water molecule, together with an area next to the catalytic Asp25A and Asp25B and at the far end of S2 and S2 and near Gly27A and Gly27B, which are part of the peptide recognition motif. The positions of the experimentally observed water molecules are in good agreement with the calculated fields. In the case of the PRWT (Fig. 6a) and the PRI50V (Fig. 6b) complexes, similar observations are made except for the GRID interaction field near Thr80A and Val82A.

oxygen to the main-chain NH of Asp30B and of the carboxamido nitrogen to the corresponding Asp30B side chain are observed in all complexes. The water-mediated interaction to the side chain of Asp29A and the direct interaction to the backbone NH of Asp30A in S2 exhibit a high level of similarity. The C atoms of Ile84A and Ile84B are in close contact to the benzylic methylene groups of the ligand (PRWT, 3.3/3.3 Å; PRI50V, 3.5/3.6 Å). In PRI84V, the C atoms of Val84A and Val84B only show van der Waals contacts of 3.8 and 4.1 Å. The burial of the ligand surface within the binding pocket sums up to 95% in the case of PRI50V and to 96% in the case of PRWT and PRI84V. An intercalation of a water molecule (O3074) is observed in PRI84V and results in additional polar protein­ligand interactions. The water molecule establishes hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of Val82A, to the side chain of Thr80A, and to one ligand sulfonyl oxygen atom (Fig. 5d). The binding pockets were analyzed with the program GRID. The resulting interaction fields of a water probe for PRI84V are displayed in Fig. 6f.

Discussion
The intention of this study was to elucidate the potential of a new class of HIV PIs against crucial point mutations. The unique mode in addressing the enzyme's subpockets observed for the C2-symmetric pyrrolidines suggests deviating susceptibility towards amino acid exchanges at the S1/S2 and S1/S2 pocket interfaces. The studied variants Ile50Val and Ile84Val are major mutations, both expanding the protease's binding pocket. Kinetic characterization reveals significant affinity decrease towards all four applied fluorogenic substrates with respect to the mutants. Similar observations are made for the inhibitors in the case of the Ile50Val mutation; however, they were less pronounced as compared to the substrates. In contrast, the inhibitors retain or even increase affinity towards the Ile84Val mutant. Obviously, removal of the methylene groups results in a different response in terms of binding affinity. Both inhibitors 8 and 9 are almost completely buried in all complexes due to the tunnel-shaped

354

binding cavity of the protease. The mutations at the pivotal positions do not influence the burial of the ligands. With respect to the Ile50Val complexes, a high level of similarity with the wild-type counterparts is observed. The side chains of Ile50B form presumably unfavorable close contacts to the sulfonyl oxygen atoms in PRWT and PRI50V. In the wild-type protease, C of Ile50A is in van der Waals contact to carbon atoms of the phenyl moiety of compounds 8 and 9. In contrast, in PRI50V, the isoleucine exchange results in a loss of these favorable interactions, thus explaining the drop in inhibitor affinity. In the case of amprenavir, which bears a similar P2 moiety, the susceptibility towards the Ile50Val mutation is also attributed to these interactions.26 Larger differences are observed in the case of the PRI84V complexes. Ligand and protein conformation, along with the formed polar interactions, is highly conserved. In PRI84V, C of Ile50B forms van der Waals contacts to the phenyl moiety of the inhibitors. This contact is not observed in the wild type. Regarding the PRWT complexes, the C atoms of Ile84A and Ile84B have unfavorable short van der Waals contacts with ligand atoms. Through exchange of these residues to valine, these unfavorable contacts are relaxed. The overall hydrophobic surface present in PRWT and PRI50V changes significantly, leading to a stronger exposure of the polar surfaces of Thr80 and Val82. In the wild-type complexes, the hydroxyl group of Thr80 is generally involved in a hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl of Val82. As a result of the created additional space in PRI84V, a water molecule is picked up and participates in polar interactions, forming a hydrogen-bond network connecting Thr80A and Val82A with one sulfonyl oxygen atom of the ligand. In PRWT complexes, this oxygen atom is not involved in any polar interactions. At the symmetry-related B-domain, intercalation of a water molecule is not observed in the mutant, likely due to the shorter distance of the sulfonyl oxygen atom to the polar groups. Considering the results of a GRID analysis, the intercalation of a water molecule seems to be highly favorable in the A-domain. The additional hydrogen bonds to Thr80A and Val82A and the loss of short van der Waals contacts to the residue in position 84A induce a slightly different loop conformation of the A-chain residues 79­84 of PRI84V. This is reflected by an increased rmsd of this region to PRWT: 0.56 Å in the case of compound 8 and 0.54 Å in the case of compound 9. This reorganization leads to a better mutual surface match of the ligand in the S1 pocket. In summary, these contributions add up to an improved affinity of this class of ligands towards the Ile84Val mutant. The amount of each individual contribution is difficult to assign and will depend on slight differences in the shape and accordingly accommodated binding mode. Clearly, the individual contributions are not additive as can be seen when compounds 8, 9 and 10 are compared. Inhibitors 8 versus 9 and 10 are equipped with different polar substituents (NH2 versus CONH2).

They induce slightly different arrangements in the corresponding S2/S2 pockets. Via the rigid central scaffold, this discrepancy is translated into small orientational differences of the ligands in the S1/S1 pockets. They result in shorter van der Waals contacts to Ile84 for compound 9 compared to compound 8. Mutating this residue to the smaller valine results in a relief of steric strain and provokes the observed increase in affinity discrimination between PRI84V and PRWT.

Summary and Conclusion
The investigated pyrrolidine-based inhibitors provide a novel strategy to target the subpockets of HIV protease. This leads to a different occupation of the binding pocket, especially next to the border between the S1/S2 and S1/S2 pockets. The properties of the new inhibitor class have been examined towards the active-site mutations Ile50Val and Ile84Val. Kinetic data indicate a contrary behavior: reduced affinity towards PRI50V and improved potency towards PRI84V. The determination of cocrystal structures of two representative inhibitors (compounds 8 and 9) with the wild type and the two variants provides the structural basis to explain this observation. The reduced affinity towards PRI50V could be rationalized in terms of reduced van der Waals contacts, an observation already described in literature for amprenavir. In the case of PRI84V, multiple contributions are responsible: Amplified van der Waals contacts, enhanced polar interactions mediated by an intercalating water molecule that fills the gap created by the mutational exchange, and relief of steric strain likely given in the wild-type complexes. The Ile84Val mutation is discussed in literature mainly as an expansion of the active-site volume, lowering beneficial van der Waals contacts to a bound ligand. Here, we can trace the exchange in more detail and make changes in the exposed physicochemical properties responsible for the modified interaction profile. The investigated pyrrolidines are very rigid ligands. They cannot optimally adapt their shape to the PRWT binding pocket. Surface complementarity of the PRI84V binding pocket is more appropriate to accommodate an inhibitor compared to the wild type, exhibiting, in best case, a Ki of 12 nM for compound 10. The message to be learned from this study concerns the change in physicochemical properties of the binding pocket upon Ile84Val mutation that can be exploited for inhibitor design. Taking advantage of these features might avoid the susceptibility towards this mutation, which has proven to be problematic for all presently approved inhibitors. Furthermore, this study unambiguously shows that large affinity changes, for example, a factor of 40 in the case of compound 9, might result from very small deviations in the protein­ligand complexes. It also points to the limitations in modeling such differences. Only the detailed analysis of multiple complexes in terms of structure­activity relationships provides

deeper insights into the various contributions responsible for protein­ligand interactions.

Experimental Procedures
Inhibitor preparation The inhibitors were synthesized enantioselectively from reported.12 Stock solutions of inhibitors for kinetic measurements and co-crystallization were obtained by dissolving them in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

concentration. Inhibition data for PRWT, PRI50V, and PRI84V were determined as follows: IC50 values were taken from plots of vi/v0 versus inhibitor concentration, in which vi and v0 are the velocities in the presence and in the absence of an inhibitor, respectively. The hydrolysis of substrate A was recorded as the increase in fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength, 337 nm; emission wavelength, 410 nm) over a time period of 10 min, during which the signal increased linearly with time.31 Ki values were calculated from the following equation: Ki = [IC50 - (Et/2)] [1 + (S/Km)]- 1. Data collection, phasing, and refinement The data sets were collected at the synchrotron BESSY II in Berlin/Germany on PSF beamline 14.2 (8 PRI50V, PDB ID: 2R43), equipped with a MAR-CCD detector, and on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV image plate detector using Cu K radiation from an in-house Rigaku rotating anode (8 PRI84V, PDB ID: 2R3W; 9 PRI50V, PDB ID: 2R3T; and 9 PRI84V, PDB ID: 2R38). Data were processed and scaled with Denzo and Scalepack as implemented in HKL2000.32 The structures were determined by the molecular replacement method with Phaser;33 one monomer of the 1.50-Å HIV-1 protease in complex with a pyrrolidine-based inhibitor (PDB ID: 2PQZ) was used as the search model. The structure refinement was continued with SHELXL97;34 for each refinement step, at least 10 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization were performed, with restraints on bond distances, angles, and B-values. Intermittent cycles of model building were done with the program Coot.35 GRID analysis and surface calculations The calculations of the molecular interaction fields were performed with GREATER, a graphical user interface for the program GRID, version 22.36 The interaction box was defined to enclose the entire active sites. The grid spacing was equal to 0.33 Å (NPLA = 3), and the maximum positive cutoff energy was set to 8 kcal/mol and visualized with PyMOL.37 The buried surface area was calculated with the program MS developed by Connolly.38 The program calculates the molecular surface from atom coordinates; the probe radius was set to 1.4 Å.

Mutant preparation, purification, and crystallization Mutants were prepared using the polymerase chain reaction with the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).29 The pET11a plasmid containing the HIV-1 protease gene was kindly provided by Professor Helena Danielson, University of Uppsala. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were used as mutagenic primers: 5-CCAAAAATGATAGGGGGAGTTGGAGGTTTTATCAAAGTAAG-3 and 5-CTTACTTTGATAAAACCTCCAACTCCCCCTATCATTTTTGG-3 for I50V and 5-GGACCTACACCTGTCAACGTAATTGGAAGAAATCTGTTG-3 and 5-CAACAGATTTCTTCCAATTACGTTGACAGGTGTAGGTCC-3 for I84V. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The PRWT, PRI50V, and PRI84V HIV protease variants were consecutively expressed from Escherichia coli and purified as previously described.30 The HIV PI complexes were crystallized at 18 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method using a 1:1 ratio. Crystals were obtained by co-crystallization of the enzyme with inhibitor concentrations ranging from 50- to 100-fold the Ki value and a final DMSO concentration of 5%. One microliter of the well buffer (0.1 M Bis­Tris and 2.5­3.0 M NaCl, pH 6.5) was mixed with 1 L of the protein solution (50 mM NaOAc, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 1 mM DTT, pH 6.5) with an HIV protease concentration of 7­10 mg/mL. Crystals were obtained within 1­ 2 days and exhibited a rectangular shape. Crystals were further optimized using streak-seeding techniques. For cryoprotection, the crystals were briefly soaked in mother liquor containing 25% glycerol. Kinetic assay Enzymatic assays were performed in 172 L assay buffer (100 mM 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 300 mM KCl, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 5.5) by the addition of substrate dissolved in 4 L DMSO, distinct inhibitor concentrations dissolved in 4 L DMSO, and 20 L HIV-1 protease in assay buffer to a final volume of 200 L (final DMSO concentration, 4%). Fluorogenic anthranilyl-HIV protease substrates A [Abz-Thr-Ile-Nle-(p-NO2-Phe)-GlnArg-NH2] and B [Abz-Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-(p-NO2-Phe)Phe-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH2] were purchased from Bachem, and substrates C [Abz-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-(p-NO2-Phe)-Phe-GluAla-Nle-NH2] and D [Abz-Arg-Val-Nle-(p-NO2-Phe)-PheGlu-Ala-Nle-NH2] were from Sigma-Aldrich. The kinetic constants for PRWT, PRI50V, and PRI84V were determined by the method of Lineweaver and Burk. The total enzyme concentration was quantified by titrating with the strong binding inhibitor saquinavir at a 200-fold higher enzyme
