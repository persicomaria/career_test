Two recent papers provide the first evidence for a common mechanism of targeting and activation of an enzyme that is important in the rapid regulation of both focal adhesion assembly during cell migration and synaptic vesicle recycling at nerve terminals.

Given the importance of integrin-mediated signaling at sites of cell contact with the extracellular matrix, surprisingly little is known about the early events following integrin ligation that culminate in the creation of focal adhesions -- actin-linked structural and signaling centers that mediate cell migration, proliferation and survival. We know that integrins cluster at these sites, and that their short cytoplasmic tails (containing between 20 and 50 residues), which lack enzymatic activity, separate and become available to bind cytosolic proteins [1­3]. Signaling then proceeds by the binding of adapter molecules and enzymes that recognize the free and clustered tails. We know the identity of many of these players, and something of the mechanisms of activation of individual molecules, but we lack a sequential cause-and-effect pathway leading to focal adhesion assembly. Two recent papers add an important piece to the puzzle, by providing the first complete link between focal adhesion targeting and activation of an enzyme that regulates focal adhesion assembly [4,5]. The  enzyme, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type 1  (PIPK1), synthesizes PI 4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a key activator of proteins involved in focal adhesion assembly (see below). Both papers demonstrate that  PIPK1 localizes to focal adhesions by binding to the prominent integrin- and actin-binding protein, talin.  Moreover, binding to talin not only targets PIPK1 to the focal adhesions, but also greatly stimulates the cat alytic activity of PIPK1. A further level of regulation is  provided by the phosphorylation of talin-bound PIPK1 by focal adhesion kinase (FAK), another prominent focal adhesion regulator that is activated at an early stage following integrin ligation.  So how does talin engage PIPK1 ? The 28 amino  acid carboxy-terminal tail of PIPK1 is required for binding talin and localizing to focal adhesions. Deletion analysis narrowed down the binding motif to the heptapeptide, WVYSPLH [4] (Figure 1A). The 40 kDa head region of talin contains the three-lobed FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain, first observed in moesin [6]. The third lobe of this domain, F3, resembles a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and is

 sufficient for binding PIPK1. (It should be noted that the name PTB is misleading, as not all such domains recognize phosphotyrosine.) A number of high-resolution crystal and NMR structures have been solved for various PTB­peptide complexes [7]. The key recognition elements are a short  strand that augments a  sheet of the PTB domain, and a consensus NPxY motif that forms a reverse turn packing against the top of the domain (Figure 1B). The F3 domain of talin binds to isolated integrin  tails in vitro in an NPxY-dependent (non-phosphorylated) fashion, and activates integrins when overexpressed in cells [8]. Our recent crystallographic studies have confirmed that F3 does indeed engage integrin in a manner similar to a PTB­peptide interaction [9]. The integrin sequence differs from typical PTB­NPxY interactions in that one or two extra residues are inserted between the NPxY `reverse turn' and the upstream  strand. Comparison of the  sequences of F3-binding motifs suggests that PIPK1 can engage the talin F3 domain in a similar fashion, but would bind in a `classical' mode, and it is straightforward to build a three-dimensional atomic model of the interaction (Figure 1B). As noted above, PI(4,5)P2 activates a number of molecules involved in focal adhesion assembly, including vinculin [10,11] and talin [12]. It seems to do this by `opening-up' the molecules, thus relieving autoinhibitory head­tail interactions. In the case of talin, it appears that the carboxy-terminal tail blocks the  binding site on F3 for integrins and PIPK1. Thus, while  talin activates PIPK1 allosterically by binding to its  carboxy-terminal tail, the catalytic action of PIPK1 activates talin, in an example of positive feedback. The  interplay between PIPK1, talin and integrin may be even more complex, since, as we have suggested,  PIPK1 and integrin compete for the same site on talin. Ling et al. [5] show that moderate overexpression of  PIPK1 results in larger focal adhesions, while high  overexpression of PIPK1 results in a loss of talin from focal adhesions. This suggests that, under normal conditions, there is enough talin available to provide  binding sites for both PIPK1 and integrin, but when  PIPK1 is in excess, direct competition for the F3 domain would lead to dissociation of talin from the integrin. One level of regulation may be different however: while the NPLY motif of 3 integrin is subject to tyrosine phosphorylation by Src [13], which switches its binding preference from talin to Shc [8], the SPLH  motif of PIPK1 should be immune to such regulation.  PIPK1 was previously identified as an abundant enzyme in the brain that is concentrated at synapses [14,15]. Along with the opposing action of the phosphatase synaptojanin, PI(4,5)P2 mediates clathrin uncoating and actin dynamics at endocytic zones [14,16] of presynaptic nerve terminals. The release of neurotransmitters from vesicles across the synaptic junction requires a high level of synaptic vesicle

(B) 3D model, in spacefilling and ribbon representations. In this  model, the tryptophan in the PIPK1 sequence (which is critical for talin binding [4]), binds into a deep pocket on the surface of F3. The SPLH sequence adopts the same reverse-turn conformation as the classic NPxY motif. Thus, the serine residue would play a similar role to the asparagine, forming an N-cap to the reverse turn; the proline promotes the reverse turn; the leucine packs against the hydrophobic surface of F3; and the histidine takes the place of the tyrosine or phenylalanine found in the integrins, packing against a flat, somewhat acidic surface.

recycling, presumably involving rapid cytoskeletal reorganization as well as membrane remodeling. Activatable, localized synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 via binding to talin would thus seem to be important for the dynamic remodeling of the presynaptic membrane. During migration of non-neuronal cells, a similarly rapid  remodeling of membrane is required, in which PIPK1 would also appear to play a central role. In conclusion, previous studies have provided a link between membrane dynamics and the activation of other PIPK1 isoforms [17]. The unique focal adhesion  targeting sequence of PIPK1 allows for further levels of control. Thus, localization and allosteric activation by binding to talin should result in a moderate level of membrane remodeling, as occurs, for example, when cells spread. Cell migration or a high level of synaptic vesicle recycling would presumably require the higher  level of PIPK1 activity achieved when talin-bound  PIPK1 is phosphorylated by FAK.
