The conserved Arg42 of the flavoprotein p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is located at the entrance of the active site in a loop between helix H2 and sheet E1 of the FAD-binding domain. Replacement of Arg42 by Lys or Ser decreases the turnover rate of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens by more than two orders of magnitude. Rapid reaction kinetics show that the low activity of the Arg42 variants results from impaired binding of NADPH. In contrast to an earlier conclusion drawn for p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, substitution of Arg42 with Ser42 in the enzyme from P. fluorescens hardly disturbs the binding of FAD. Crystals of [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexed with 4-hydroxybenzoate diffract to 0.22-nm resolution. The structure of the Lys42 variant is virtually indistinguishable from the native enzyme with the flavin ring occupying the interior position within the active site. Lys42 in the mutant structure interacts indirectly via a solvent molecule with the 3-OH of the adenosine ribose moiety of FAD. Substrate perturbation difference spectra suggest that the Arg42 replacements influence the solvent accessibility of the flavin ring in the oxidized enzyme. In spite of this, the Arg42 variants fully couple enzyme reduction to substrate hydroxylation. Sequencecomparison studies suggest that Arg42 is involved in binding of the 2-phosphoadenosine moiety of NADPH.

p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is the prototype of the family of pyridine-nucleotide-dependent flavoprotein monooxygenases [1]. The enzyme catalyzes the ortho-hydroxylation of 4hydroxybenzoate to 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, an intermediate step in the degradation of aromatic compounds in soil microorganisms [2]. The p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase-mediated conversion of 4-hydroxybenzoate is a multistep reaction with three substrates and three products.

Pseudomonas p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase has been studied by means of many techniques, including rapid reaction kinetics [3 5], protein crystallography [6 8] and with site-directed mutagenesis [9]. As a result, many aspects of the catalytic reaction are very well known, especially the steps involving oxygen. However, many important aspects of the reductive reactions involving NADPH are unknown [10]. We do not even know the

NADPH-binding site. Attempts to crystallize or soak p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase crystals with NADPH or analogs were unsuccesful. Either no NADPH binding was observed, or with the analog adenosine-5-phosphoribose the FAD got replaced [11]. p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase has a A nucleotide-binding fold for the FAD, but not for NADPH [6]. p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase has no sites with sequence or structural similarity to known NAD(P)H-binding sites [12], making it impossible to predict the binding site. Also unexplained is the mechanism behind the stimulation of the reduction rate by the substrate. In the absence of substrate, NADPH is hardly able to reduce the FAD. Substrate binding causes an acceleration of the reduction rate by more than five orders of magnitude [4]. To answer these questions, we need to know the binding mode of NADPH. In the absence of a crystal structure, we decided to identify, by means of site-directed mutagenesis, residues that are essential for NADPH binding, to provide an experimental basis for the modeling of the NADPH-binding mode. Chemical-modification studies of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from P. fluorescens suggested that arginine residues are important for NADPH binding [13], making arginine residues an attractive target for site-directed mutagenesis. Based on the crystal structure, we selected a number of arginine residues around the active-site cleft. The first arginine we found to be important for NADPH binding was Arg44. Replacement of Arg44 by lysine strongly reduced the affinity for NADPH without disrupting the efficiency of substrate hydroxylation [14]. Arg42 is another conserved residue, possibly involved in NADPH binding. Arg42 is located at the entrance of the active site and points with its side chain towards the 2-OH and 3-OH of

the adenine-ribose moiety of FAD [7] (Fig. 1). From nucleotide sequencing of a pobA-deficient mutant it was proposed that replacement of Arg42 by Ser in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from A. calcoaceticus reduces FAD binding by disturbing the ADP-ribose pocket [15]. We present here studies of Arg42 variants of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from P. fluorescens, which show that Arg42 is crucial for NADPH binding rather than for FAD binding. Some of these results have been presented elsewhere [16]. MATERIALS AND METHODS Site-specific mutagenesis. Escherichia coli TG2 (pAW45), harboring the gene encoding p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from P. fluorescens, has been described [17]. Site-specific mutagenesis, using E. coli RZ1032 for generation of uracil-containing single-stranded DNA, was performed in the bacteriophage M13mp18 according to the method of Kunkel et al. [18]. Mutations were introduced in the gene encoding the microheterogeneity resistant [Ser116]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase mutant [19]. For convenience and in view of the identical catalytic and structural properties [19], [Ser116]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is referred to as p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. The mixed oligonucleotide 5-CGTGCTCGGCAAAATCCGCGCC-3, T CC which encodes the Lys42 (AAA) and Ser42 (TCC) substitutions, was used for the construction of Arg42 mutants. The mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using the M13 dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method of Sanger et al. [20]. Expression and enzyme purification. p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase genes were expressed in transformed E. coli TG2 cells grown in 3-l batches of tryptone/yeast medium containing 75 µg/ml ampicillin and 20 µg/ml isopropyl thiogalactoside at 37°C with vigorous aeration [21]. The Arg42 mutants were purified by a modified procedure of the purification protocol developed for p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase [17]. The enzyme preparation obtained after protamine sulfate treatment was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (40 cm 2.6 cm), equilibrated in 20 mM Tris/sulfate, pH 8.0. After washing, the enzyme was eluted with 0.2 M KCl in starting buffer and dialysed against 40 mM Tris/sulfate, pH 8.0. The enzyme was loaded onto a Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose column (40 cm 2.6 cm), equilibrated in 40 mM Tris/sulfate, pH 8.0, and eluted in the wash solution. After dialysis in 7 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, the enzyme was passed over a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated in 7 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 [22]. The Arg42 mutants were purified to apparent homogeneity by FPLC anion-exchange chromatography [23], and stored as an 70% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitate at 4°C. Analytical methods. Molar absorption coefficients for protein-bound FAD were determined in 50 mM sodium phosphate,

pH 7.0, by recording absorption spectra in the absence and presence of 0.1 % SDS [24]. p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase activity was assayed in 100 mM Tris/sulfate, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EDTA, 200 µM NADPH, 200 µM 4-hydroxybenzoate and 10 µM FAD [25]. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined at pH 8.0, essentially as described [26]. Rapid-reaction kinetics were determined using a stopped flow spectrophotometer, type SF-51 (High-Tech Scientific Inc.) Rate constants for anaerobic flavin reduction were estimated from kinetic traces recorded at 450 nm using variable concentrations of NADPH [14]. Kinetic traces of the oxidative half-reaction were analyzed essentially as described [5]. The hydroxylation efficiency of Arg42 mutants was estimated from oxygen-consumption experiments [26]. Hydrogen peroxide formation was quantified by the addition of catalase at the end of the reaction. Aromatic products were identified and quantified by reverse-phase HPLC [24]. Dissociation constants of enzyme · substrate complexes were determined fluorimetrically [27]. Absorption difference spectra between free and substrate-complexed enzymes were recorded on an Aminco DW-spectrophotometer [17]. Crystallization and data collection. Crystals of [Lys42]phydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexed with 4-hydroxybenzoate were obtained using the hanging-drop method. The protein solution contained 10 15 mg/ml enzyme in 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The reservoir solution contained 39% saturated ammonium sulfate, 0.04 mM FAD, 0.15 mM EDTA, 30 mM sodium sulfite, 1 mM 4-hydroxybenzoate 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Drops of 2 µl protein solution and 2 µl reservoir solution were allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C against 1 ml reservoir solution. Crystals with dimensions of up to 0.2 0.3 0.1 mm3 grew within 3 5 days. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Siemens multiwire area detector and graphite monochromated CuKA radiation from an 18-kW Siemens rotating anode generator, operating at 45 kV and 100 mA. The crystal-detector distance was 11.6 cm and the 2 angle was 20°. Data were processed using the XDS package [28]. The space group was C2221 and the cell dimensions, a 7.135 nm, b 14.59 nm and c 8.88 nm, differ only slightly from the native crystals, a 7.15 nm, b 14.58 nm and c 8.82 nm [7]. A total of 78 553 observations yielded 23 174 unique reflections with an R-sym of 6.7%. The data set is 96.8% complete to 0.22 nm. Structure refinement. A starting electron-density map was calculated based on the structure of the enzyme · substrate complex [7], after a correction had been made for the slightly different cell dimensions [29]. The starting R-factor was 0.232 for data between 0.80 nm and 0.22 nm. The 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps show the replacement of Arg42 by Lys. Arg42 in the model was changed into Lys and was fitted in the electron-density map with the graphics program O [30]. The complete pro-

For FAD we used the parameters as described by Schreuder et al. [29]. Water molecules were assigned by searching Fo-Fc maps for peaks of at least 4, which were between 0.20 nm and 0.50 nm of other protein or water atoms. Water molecules with temperature factors after refinement in excess of 0.7 nm2 were rejected.

Replacement of Arg42 by Lys or Ser in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from P. fluorescens did not significantly

change the level of protein expression. With both recombinant enzymes, expression yields up to 10% of total E. coli protein were observed. Unlike wild-type enzyme, the Arg42 mutants displayed a rather weak interaction with Cibacron-blue agarose. In spite of this, their yields after purification were comparable to that of native p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase [17]. Moreover, the purified Arg42 mutants were bright yellow, indicative of tight binding of FAD. Structural properties. The structure of [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was very similar to the structure of native phydroxybenzoate hydroxylase [7]. The rmsd was 0.02 nm for 391 equivalent CA atoms. The side chain of Lys42 had the same orientation as the side chain of Arg42 in the native structure (Fig. 2). A water molecule (Wat249 in the model) occupied the position of the guanidinium group of the larger arginine side chain and bridged the 3-OH of the FAD ribose and the NZ of Lys42 (Table 1). The only significant difference in the neighborhood of the modified residue was a small rotation of the Tyr38

side chain, which faced the solvent. The active sites of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase were identical within experimental error. However, the electron density of the guanidinium part of the Arg44 side chain was very weak in [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Fig. 3), while this side chain had strong electron density in phydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. Accordingly, the temperature factors of the Arg44 NH1 and NH2 were around 0.7 nm2 for [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, and around 0.43 nm2 for p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, suggesting that the Arg44 side chain has became more mobile in the Lys42 variant. Attempts to obtain high-quality crystals of [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase failed. The protein-flavin interaction in this mutant was therefore assessed by spectral analysis. Spectral properties. X-ray diffraction studies have revealed that the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase can attain different conformations inside and outside the active site [29, 32, 33]. Substrate-binding studies suggest that the flavin conformation observed in the crystal structure correlates with the flavin spectral properties in solution [32]. This concept was used to study the mode of flavin binding in the Arg42 mutants in further detail. Fig. 4 shows that the shape of the difference spectrum between free and 4-hydroxybenzoate complexed [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Fig. 4A), resembled that of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Fig. 4 C), suggesting an `in' position for the flavin ring, in full agreement with the crystal structure. Titration of [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase with 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, resulted, similarly to titration of

native p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, in difference spectra indicative for the flavin `out' conformation [32]. Binding of 4hydroxybenzoate to [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Fig. 4 B) induced spectral changes, which deviate from those of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and which are intermediate between the changes observed for the flavin `in' and `out' spectra. The Arg42 mutants have a somewhat lower affinity for 4hydroxybenzoate and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate than p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, which was studied in more detail by fluorimetric titration experiments. For both Arg42 variants, the flavin fluorescence quantum yield was about 40% compared with that of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase [27]. In contrast to phydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, the flavin fluorescences of [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase were not strongly quenched upon binding

The experiments were performed at 25 °C in 100 mM Tris/sulfate pH 8.0. 20 µM enzyme was mixed anaerobically with an equal volume of NADPH in the stoppedflow spectrophotometer.

of 4-hydroxybenzoate. With [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, the enzyme · substrate complex exhibited a fluorescence quantum yield of more than 80% of that of the free enzyme, while with [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, substrate binding even resulted in a slight increase of flavin fluorescence. In both cases, substrate binding was described by simple binary · complex formation with dissociation constants in the range 100 120 µM. These values were about threefold higher than those observed with p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Table 2) and were in agreement with the dissociation constants derived from the absorption difference spectra. Binding of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate to the Arg42 mutants resulted in a 50% decrease in fluorescence of protein-bound FAD with dissociation constants in the range 240 280 µM, threefold higher than with phydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Table 2). These results confirm that the Arg42 replacements have a small but consistent effect on the binding of aromatic substrates. Catalytic properties. Very low activities were observed when the catalytic performance of the Arg42 mutants was tested at pH 8.0 (standard assay) and at pH 7.0. This was due to a large extent to weak binding of NADPH, limiting the accurate estimation of steady-state kinetic parameters (Table 3). To confirm that the low activity was not due to FAD dissociation, we measured the turnover rate of the Arg42 mutants in the absence and presence of varying amounts of free FAD. These experiments revealed that the apparent Km for FAD of [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase ranged from 100 nM to 200 nM, which is slightly higher than the corresponding value of 45 nM reported for p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase [25]. This, together with the structural and spectral data presented above, shows that replacement of Arg42 by Lys or Ser does not significantly disturb FAD binding. The interaction of the Arg42 mutants with NADPH was studied by anaerobic-reduction experiments using the stoppedflow spectrophotometer. Following the disappearance of flavin absorption at 450 nm, the reaction of the uncomplexed Arg42 mutants with NADPH was as slow as with p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (ked 0.002 s 1 at 1 mM NADPH) [14]. However, r reduction of the enzyme · substrate complex was much slower for the Arg42 mutants than for native p-hydroxybenzoate hy-

droxylase, taking seconds or longer (Table 3). There was an almost linear relationship between the rate of enzyme reduction and NADPH concentration (Fig. 5), suggesting impaired coenzyme binding. In agreement with this, no long-wavelength-absorbance increase, indicative of a charge-transfer complex between reduced flavin and NADP [14, 34], was detectable. However, the effector role of the substrate was not completely lost in the Arg42 mutants. For example, at 1 mM NADPH, substrate binding stimulated the rate of flavin reduction of [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase by about three orders of magnitude (Table 3), which is nevertheless 100-fold less than for p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase [17] and which is rate limiting in catalysis (Table 3). With both Arg42 mutants, HPLC analysis revealed the formation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate as the sole aromatic product from 4-hydroxybenzoate. The formation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate was stoichiometric with the consumption of 4-hydroxybenzoate and NADPH, indicative of efficient hydroxylation. Oxygen-consumption experiments performed in the absence or presence of catalase confirmed that the reduction of the Arg42 mutants by NADPH is tightly coupled to substrate hydroxylation and that no hydrogen peroxide is formed. Stopped-flow experiments in which substrate-complexed reduced Arg42 mutants were mixed with oxygen (Fig. 6) revealed some small variations at 405 nm between [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, probably due to different intrinsic absorption at that wavelength. The rapid increase of absorption at 405 nm, indicative of the formation of the flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide, was followed by a small absorption decrease (Fig. 6), indicative for substrate hydroxylation involving the transient formation of the flavin C(4a)-hydroxide pseudobase [5]. In the final step, the latter flavin species rapidly decomposed to the oxidized enzyme as evidenced by the increase of absorption at 490 nm (Fig. 6 B). For both Arg42 mutants, the individual rate constants obtained after treating the data according to a three-step reaction were in the same range as with p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase [5]. This confirms that the Arg42 replacements do not significantly affect the stabilization and reactivity of oxygenated flavin intermediates.

DISCUSSION Our studies established that Arg42 of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from P. fluorescens is essential for NADPH binding and not for FAD binding. The hydrogen bond between the NH2 of Arg42 and the 3-OH of the adenosine-ribose of the FAD does not contribute much to binding of FAD. Our conclusions disagree with those of Dimarco et al. [15], who attributed the lack of activity in cell extracts of A. calcoaceticus with [Ser42]phydroxybenzoate hydroxylase to impaired FAD binding of the mutant enzyme. However, this conclusion was inferred from the crystal structure of P. fluorescens p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and no experimental data were presented to support this claim. Our experimental data and the very high sequence identity between P. fluorescens p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and A. calcoaceticus p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase suggest that the lack of enzymatic activity in [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase A. calcoaceticus extract was either due to the extremely slow reduction rate of [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase by NADPH, or due to a very low expression level for the mutant protein. Comparison of the 0.22-nm crystal structure of [Lys42]phydroxybenzoate hydroxylase with the structure of native p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase shows that both structures are virtu-

ally identical except for local changes around the site of mutation. In the Lys42 variant, the lost interaction between the guanidinium group of Arg42 and the adenosine ribose moiety of FAD is compensated by a water molecule (Wat249), which connects the NZ of Lys42 with the 3-OH of the ribose group. This bridging water molecule may explain the relatively tight binding of FAD in the Lys42 variant. The position of the substrate and interacting residues is virtually identical in both crystal structures. The decreased affinity for 4-hydroxybenzoate and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate must therefore be due to some subtle effects ° beyond the experimental error of about 0.2 A in protein crystal structures. This is possible given that a fourfold difference in affinity corresponds to a difference in binding energy of only 3.3 kJ/mol. In spite of the decreased affinity for the aromatic substrate, the Lys42 replacement did not diminish the stabilization and hydroxylation power of the flavin (C4a)-hydroperoxide. This agrees well with the inner orientation of the flavin isoalloxazine ring in the crystal structure and with the finding that the Lys42 replacement does not disturb any of active-site residues, which leaves the hydrogen-bond network between the phenolic moiety of the substrate and the side chains of Tyr201 and Tyr385 fully intact. The spectral properties of [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase are consistent with the closed conformation of the flavin in the crystal structure. The small spectral differences with respect to p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase might be explained by the significantly higher mobility of the Arg44 side chain, which normally shields the flavin ring from the solvent. Increased exposure of the flavin ring towards the solvent will cause similar spectral changes as a movement of the flavin to the `out' position, since this leads also to an increased solvent exposure. Since the flavin conformation in the Arg42 variant does not differ significantly from that in native p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, we cannot explain the lack of NADPH binding or flavin reduction by a shift of the flavin conformation from `in' to `out'. Although no structural data for [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase are available it seems that in this mutant protein the interaction between the side chain of residue 42 and the adenosine-ribose moiety of FAD will be weakened with respect to the Lys42 variant. Our data show that despite this weakened interaction, FAD binding is normal. The spectral perturbations upon titration with 4-hydroxybenzoate are shifted toward the spectral changes associated with the `out' conformation, suggesting that in [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase the equilibrium of flavin conformers is shifted toward the open form. However, in the absence of structural data we cannot exclude the possibility that the spectral changes are due to increased solvent exposure due to an even greater mobility of the Arg44 side chain in [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. [Lys42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase fully couple flavin reduction to substrate hydroxylation, which means that the flavin (C4a)-hydroperoxide must have the `in' conformation [35]. In this respect, the Arg42 mutants differ from [Lys220]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, in which increased mobility of the flavin ring prevents product formation [36]. These observations suggest that for [Ser42]p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase the shift in flavin equilibrium, if present, must be limited to the oxidized state. This means that the electrostatic stabilization of the anionic reduced flavin in the inner position is not disturbed by the removal of the positive charge at position 42. This is not too surprising given that Arg42 is not located in the active-site region. p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase lacks a recognizable domain for binding NADPH [6, 9]. Sequence alignments suggest

that this may be a common property of the flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylases [37]. Here we show that in P. fluorescens p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase substitution of Arg42 with lysine or serine results in impaired NADPH binding, preventing efficient reduction of protein-bound FAD. Arg42 must therefore be important for NADPH recognition. Information about the specific function of Arg42 comes from recent studies on p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas CBS3 [38]. This enzyme, involved in the biodegradation of 4-chlorobenzoate, prefers NADH over NADPH. In the Pseudomonas CBS3 sequence, Arg42 is replaced by a threonine residue. Moreover, sequence comparison and homology-modeling studies suggest that the short helix preceding residue 42 (helix H2 in the P. fluorescens enzyme) [7] is involved in coenzyme specificity by binding the 2-phosphoadenosine moiety of NADPH [38]. The poor NADPH binding in the Arg42 mutants of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from P. fluorescens supports this view and strengthens the idea that the NADPH molecule binds in a cleft leading towards the active-site between the FAD-binding domain and the substratebinding domain [6]. The current results are in full agreement with other mutagenesis [14, 16] and modeling studies [16], which suggested that in addition to Arg42, the following residues in the active-site cleft are important for NADPH binding: Arg44 for binding the adenosine-ribose; and His162 and Arg269 for binding the pyrophosphate. However, additional proteinengineering studies and X-ray crystallography studies are needed to unravel the molecular details of NADPH recognition by this class of flavoenzymes.
