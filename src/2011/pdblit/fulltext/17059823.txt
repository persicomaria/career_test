A high-expression plasmid for the secA gene was constructed. The SecA protein was then overproduced in E. coli and purified. The purified SecA stimulated the in vitro translccation of a model secretory protein into inverted membrane vesicles pretreated with 4 M urea. Membrane vesicles from a secAU mutant exhibited lower translocation activity, which was enhanced by SecA. These results indicate that SecA is directly involved in protein secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane. Protein, SecA, Protein overproduction; Protein secretion; (E. co/r)

1. INTRODUCTION A temperature-sensitive(ts) secA mutation was first described by Oliver and Beckwith [l] to be defective in secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane of proteins of the outer membrane and the periplasmic space in Escherichia co/i. The secA gene was mapped at 2.5 min on the E. coli chromosomal map [l] and its entire nucleotide sequence was determined [2]. However, the participation of SecA, the secA gene product, in protein secretion has not been well demonstrated biochemically. Recently, we developed an in vitro system that exhibits efficient protein translocation into inverted membrane vesicles of E. coli. This was achieved by fractionation of the conventional inverted membrane vesicle preparation by means of sucrose gradient centrifugation [3] and by the use of a model protein possessing an uncleavable signal peptide [4]. The uncleavability prevents in vitro premature processing of the signal peptide, thereby enhancing the translocation efficiency. UsCorrespondence address: S.

ing this in vitro translocation system, the requirements of energy and soluble factors for the translocation reaction were studied [3,4]. In the present work, using the in vitro translocation system, we demonstrated that SecA is directly involved in membrane translocation of secretory proteins. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmids The E. coli K12 strains used were: MC4100 (F-, araDI36 A(/ac)Ul69 relA rpsL thrl [S], MM52 (MC4100secAtS) [l] and RR1 @ro leu thi lacy hsdR endA rpsL20 aro-14 galK2 xyl-5 mtl-I supE44) [6]. Plasmid pK107 carries a gene that codes for an uncleavable signal peptide-containing OmpF-Lpp chimeric protein (uncleavable OmpF-Lpp) [4]. The gene is under the control of the SP6 promoter. 2.2. Preparation of S150-2 extracts and inverted membrane vesicles Membrane-free SlSO-2 extracts were prepared from E. coli MC4100 or MM52 as described in [7]. Purified inverted membrane vesicles were prepared as described in [3]. 2.3. Urea treatment of membrane vesicles Membrane vesicles (40 fig protein per reaction mixture) were treated with 4 M urea and then with 5OrM DCCD (N,N `-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) as described in [3] except that membrane vesicles were recovered by centrifugation at

350000 x g for 45 min and suspended in 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.8)/10% glyceroV8.50lo sucrose. In control experiments, membrane vesicles were similarly treated in the absence of urea. 2.4. Transcription, translation and translocation reactions Uncleavable OmpF-Lpp was used as the substrate for translocation experiments. In vitro transcription and translation in the presence of Tran'sS-label, a mixture of 70% ["Slmethionine and 20% ["`Slcysteine (1000 Ci/mmol, 1 Ci = 37 GBq), were carried out as described in [4]. The translocation reaction was carried out at 40°C and the translocated protein, which was proteinase K-resistant, was detected on SDSpolyacrylamide gels by fluorography as described in [7]. The amount of the radioactive protein was determined densitometrically with a Toyo DMU-33C. 2.5. Purification of uncleavable OmpF-Lpp After in vitro translation, "S-labeled OmpF-Lpp was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described in [4] and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.8)/5 mM MgS04/2 mM dithiothreitol.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Construction of a plasmid carrying the secA gene An outline of the construction is presented in fig.1. A lambda phage clone, 15BlO [8], was used as the source of the se& gene. The existence of the secA gene in this clone was supported by the position of this gene on the E. coli chromosome map [l] and the restriction profiles of the relevant DNA regions [8-lo]. The lefthand half of the synthetic oligonucleotide linker shown in fig.1 is the upstream of the initiation codon on expression vector pUSI [ll] and the righthand half was the 5 `-terminus of the secA coding region [2]. 3.2. Overproduction and purification of SecA induction with isopropyl-,&DUpon thiogalactoside (IPTG) of E. coli RR1 carrying the secA gene-containing plasmid, pMAN400, a 100 kDa protein was overproduced (fig.2, lanes l-6). Based on its molecular mass and its immunoprecipitability with an anti-SecA antiserum (a generous gift from D.B. Oliver) (not shown), we conclude that this protein is SecA. Although SecA was reported to be a peripheral cytoplasmic membrane protein [12], the overproduced SecA was mainly localized in the cytosol (fig.2, lanes l-6). E. coli cells grown in 4 1 of L-broth containing 1 mM IPTG were disrupted through a French pressure cell (8000 psi, 3 times), and the supernatant obtained on high-speed centrifugation 432

(150000 x g for 2.5 h) was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.8)/14 mM Mg-acetate/60 mM K-acetate/l mM dithiothreitol and subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The 40-50% saturation fraction was dialyzed against the buffer and then chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-300 column (100 x 1.6 cm), but dithiothreitol was omitted. A fraction which essentially comprised pure SecA was obtained (fig.2). 3.3. Translocation of uncleavable OmpF-Lpp with in vitro systems derived from wild-type and secAtS cells In vitro translocation of uncleavable OmpF-Lpp took place efficiently when membrane vesicles and S-150 prepared from wild-type cells were used, whereas it was poor with those from secA" cells (fig.3). The activity in the latter case was, however, appreciably stimulated upon the addition of purified SecA. The experiment shown in fig.3 was performed at 40°C. Essentially the same results

Fig.3. Time course of translocation of uncleavable OmpF-Lpp with in vitro assay systems derived from wild-type and secA" cells. Membrane vesicles (2.5 cg) and SlSO-2 (20 pg) prepared from wild-type (0) and XCA'~ (0, A) cells were used for in vitro translocation of uncleavable OmpF-Lpp. (A) 0.25 Pg of SecA was added. 100% translocation means that all of the substrate protein became resistant to proteinase K.

Fig.2. Overproduction and purification of SecA. E. coli RR1 was transformed with pMAN400, and then grown in the absence (lanes 1 and 4) and presence (lanes 2 and 5) of 3 mM IPTG. Equivalent amounts of the cytosol (lanes l-3) and envelope (lanes 4-6) fractions were analyzed on SDSpolyacrylamide gels. Lanes 3 and 6 contained RRl, carrying pUSI2, grown in the presence of 3 mM IPTG. SecA in the cytosol fraction (lane 7) was then purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation (lane 8) and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography (lane 9). The arrow indicates SecA.

were obtained at lower temperatures (not shown), indicating that the in vivo ts phenotype was reflected only by the weak translocation activity in vitro. 3.4. Purified SecA stimulates in vitro protein translocation SecA had no effect on translocation when membrane vesicles from wild-type cells were used (fig.4A). It was suggested that 6 M urea causes the depletion of SecA in the cytoplasmic membrane 4M (Wickner, W., personal communication). urea treatment of membrane vesicles from wildtype cells resulted in an almost complete loss of translocation activity, which was restored by the addition of purified SecA (fig.4B). Since urea treatment results in the release of Fr-ATPase

leading to the formation of a proton channel, vesicles thus treated were post-treated with 50 ,uM DCCD so that they could generate the protonmotive force required for the translocation reaction [3]. Although restoration of the activity with SecA was also observed after treatment with 6 M urea, the restoration was not as good as that in the case of 4 M urea (not shown). The same amount of S-150, as to protein (fig.4B), and a 20-fold excess of it (not shown) could not replace SecA at all as to the translocation restoration, suggesting that the restoration is specific to SecA. The amount of SecA required for the restoration was then examined (fig.5). With membrane vesicles from wild-type cells, about 0.2 ,ug SecA/40yg membrane protein was sufficient for full activity. When membrane vesicles from secA" cells were used, a larger amount of SecA was required for the maximum activation. The reason for the requirement of excess SecA with urea-treated secA" membrane vesicles is not well known. The assembly of the mutant SecA in the membrane may be unusual, so that the protein cannot be extracted with 4 M urea, remaining in

Ureatreated membrane vesicles were prepared from wild-type (0) and secA*' (0) cells, and then translocation of the immunopurified uncleavable OmpF-Lpp was performed at 40°C for 10 min in the presence of the indicated concentrations of SecA. 100% translocation indicates the level of translocation with urea-untreated membrane vesicles.
