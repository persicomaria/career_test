(Received 23 September 1989; accepted 7 December 1989) The crystal structure of flavocytochrome b, has been solved at 3.0 a resolution by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering. Area detector data from native and two heavy-atom derivative crystals were used. The phases were refined by the B. C. Wang phase-filtering procedure utilizing the 67% (v/v) solvent content of the crystals. A molecular model was built first on a minimap and then on computer graphics from a combination of maps both averaged and not averaged about the molecular symmetry axis. The structure was extended to 2.4 A resolution using film data recorded at a synchrotron and refined by the Hendrickson-Konnert procedure. The molecule, a tetramer of M, 230,000, is located on a crystallographic 2-fold axis and possesses local 4-fold symmetry. Each subunit is composed of two domains, one binding a heme and the other an FMN prosthetic group. In subunit 1, bot,h the cytochrome and the tlavin-binding domain are visible in the electron density map. In subunit 2 the cytochrome domain is disordered. However, in the latter, a molecule of pyruvate, the product of thr enzymatic reaction, is bound at the active site. The cytochrome domain consists of residues 1 to 99 and is folded in a fashion similar to the homologous soluble fragment of cytochrome b,. The flavin binding domain contains a parallel /&as barrel structure and is composed of residues 100 to 486. The remaining 25 residues form a tail that wraps around the molecular 4-fold axis and is in contact with each remaining subunit. The FMN moiety, which is located at the C-terminal end of the central b-barrel, is mostly sequestered from solvent; it forms hydrogen bond interactions with main- and side-chain atoms from six of the eight &strands. The interaction of Lys349 with atoms N-l and O-2 of the flavin ring is probably responsible for stabilization of the anionic form of the flavin semiquinone and hydroquinone and enhancing the reactivity of atom N-5 toward sulfite. The binding of pyruvate at the active site in subunit 2 is stabilized by interaction of its carboxylate group with the side-chain atoms of Arg376 and Tyr143. Residues His373 and Tyr254 interact with the keto-oxygen atom and are involved in catalysis. In contrast, four water molecules occupy the substrate-binding site in subunit, 1 and Tyr143 forms a hydrogen bond to the ordered heme propionate group Otherwise the two flavin-binding domains are identical within experimental error. The mode of FMN-binding in flavocytochrome b, is very similar to that in two other FMN-containing enzymes, trimethylamine dehydrogenase and glycolate oxidase. All three enzymes are /Isa8 proteins. The detailed polypeptide conformation of the flavin-binding domain is very similar to glycolate oxidase, with which it is 37% identical in chemical sequence. However, the conformation differs considerably from that of trimethylamine dehydrogenase (sequence unknown).

of the organism on lactate, even if the rest of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is blocked, for example by antimycin (Pajot $ Claisse, 1974). The enzyme is a tetramer of subunit molecular weight 57,500 (Pajot & Groudinsky, 1970). It contains two prosthetic groups, FMN and heme, both bound non-covalently (Appleby & Morton, 1954). The complete amino acid sequence (Lederer et al., 1985) and DNA sequence (Guiard, 1985; Reid, personal communication) of flavocytochrome b, from S. cerevisiae has been determined. Flavocytochrome 6, has also been isolated from another yeast, Hansenula anomala (Labeyrie & Baudras, 1972). The enzyme carries out three catalytic functions. The first is the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate, with reduction of oxidized FMN to form the flavin hydroquinone (Capeillere-Blandin et al., 1975). Substrate a-hydrogen abstraction is the ratelimiting step for the overall reaction (Lederer, 1974) and occurs in the Saccharomyces enzyme with a unimolecular rate constant, at 5"C, of about 130 per second (Pompon et al., 1980). The reaction is believed to occur by abstraction of the a-proton of the substrate by the enzyme, followed by oxidation of the carbanion intermediate by the flavin (Lederer, 1974). The second catalytic function is reduction of the heme moiety by the reduced flavin. This occurs in two one-electron transfer steps with formation of a flavin semiquinone intermediate (Hiromi & Sturtevant, 1965). Stopped-flow kinetic studies of the Saccharomyces enzyme in the absence of electron accept'or showed that this step occurs with a unimolecular rate constant of about 600 per second at 24 "C (Capeillere-Blandin et al., 1975). The third catalytic function is the reduction of cytochrome c by the reduced heme group of the enzyme. This reaction is ionic-strength dependent, being bimolecular at high ionic strength and unimolecular at low ionic strength (Capeillere-Blandin, 1982). The unimolecular rate constant for the Hansenula enzyme is about 380 per second at 5°C. The complex between cytochrome c and flavocytochrome b, is stabilized by ionic forces between them, as, for example, in the case of the complex formed between cytochrome c and cytochrome b, (Mauk et aE., 1982). When originally isolated, the flavocytochrome b, from S. cerevisiae had undergone proteolysis by endogenous yeast proteases (Jacq & Lederer, 1972). This resulted in a loss of the first eight residues from the N terminus as well as another five residues, positions 306 to 310 (Fig. 1) to produce the cleaved form of the enzyme (Ghrir & Lederer, 1981). When isolated in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, an inhibitor of serine proteases, the intact form of the enzyme is obtained (Jacq & Lederer, 1974). The intact form has about twice the specific activity of the cleaved form and, unlike the cleaved form, is inhibited by excess substrate (Somlo & Slonimsky, 1966). Flavocytochrome b, from H. anomala differs in

some respects from the Saccharomyces enzyme (Labeyrie & Baudras, 1972). It is intact when isolated, being more resistant to proteolytic attack, and has about twice the specific activity of the uncleaved Saccharomyces enzyme (Labeyrie et al., 1978). Otherwise the two enzymes are very similar in their catalytic and structural properties. The amino acid sequence of the first 88 residues of the enzyme from Hansenula has been determined and is about 60% identical with the Saccharomyces enzyme (Haumont et aE., 1987). The entire DNA sequence encoding the Hansenula enzyme has been determined (Black et al., personal communication; Gervais, personal communication). The effects of limited proteolytic digestion on the quaternary and domain structures of the enzymes from Saccharomyces and Hansenula have been studied (Naslin et aZ., 1973). In both enzymes there is a short region hypersensitive to proteolytic digestion, corresponding to the cleavage site of yeast proteases for the Saccharomyces enzyme (Fig. 1). Such cleavage yields two polypeptide fragments, a and /?, of approximate M, 35,000 and 21,000, respectively, which can be separated under denaturing conditions. The renatured a-chain can still bind heme, but both renatured fragments are required for flavin binding (Mevel-Ninio et al.. 1977). There is a second chain segment, located near residue 100, that is also subject to proteolytic attack (Fig. 1). Limited tryptic digestion of both enzymes (Gervais et al., 1977; Gervais & Tegoni, 1980) yields two large fragments that can be separated under non-denaturing conditions. One is a

Molecular Structure of Flavoeytochrome b, heme-binding peptide of about M, 12,000 and the other a tetrameric flavin-binding entity of about M, 200,000, each subunit of which is composed of two discrete polypeptide chains. Treatment of the enzyme from H. anomala with limited amounts of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease causes cleavage only in the second protease-sensitive zone, yielding the heme-binding peptide and a tetrameric flavodehydrogenase. The latter, of subunit M, 43,000, is active with ferricyanide as electron acceptor (Gervais et al., 1983). The above studies clearly demonstrated that the flavin and heme groups reside on separate domains and that the flavinbinding domain contains the intersubunit contacts of the native tetramer. Exhaustive tryptic digestion of the Saccharomyces flavocytochrome b, yields only the heme-binding peptide, called cytochrome h, core, corresponding to approximately the first 100 residues of the molecule (Labeyrie et al., 1966). Physioco-chemical studies of the b, core by electron spin resonance (Watari et al., 1967), nuclear magnetic resonance (Keller et al., 1973) and absorption spectroscopy (Labeyrie et al., 1966) indicated a marked similarity of its properties to those of the soluble fragment of microsomal cytochrome b,. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of 6, core was found to be about 30% identical with that of the bovine cytochrome b, (Guiard et al.. 1974). This led to the hypothesis that the structures of cytochrome b2 core and cytochrome b, (Mathews et al., 1972) are very similar. Observations of comparable sequence homology in related systems have led to the recognition of a superfamily of evolutionarily related proteins containing the cytochrome b5 fold (Guiard & Lederer, 1979). The original preparations of the cleaved form of flavocytochrome bz from S. cerevisiae were reported to be crystalline (Appleby & Morton, 1954). More recent'ly, two crystalline forms of the cleaved enzyme were characterized (Monteilhet & Risler, 1970). One, a less purified form with DNA bound, crystallized in a tetragonal space group with one subunit per asymmetric unit. The other, from highly purified material, formed trigonal crystals that were thought to contain a full tetramer per asymmetric unit. In both cases the crystals were too small for conventional X-ray diffraction but could be analyzed by image reconstruction methods to yield a low-resolution model of the protein (Olive et al., 1973). We reported large crystals of the intact enzyme that were suitable for X-ray analysis (Mathews & Lederer, 1976). The unit cell parameters were close to those reported for the trigonal DNA-free form of the cleaved enzyme (Monteilhet & Risler, 1970) and also appeared to contain a tetramer in the asymmetric unit. We carried out a rotation function analysis that gave ambiguous results but that we were able to interpret on the assumptions of there being four subunits per asymmetric unit and the molecule possessing 222 point group symmetry 1979). Both of these (Bethge & Mathews, assumptions proved to be incorrect (see below).

We initially undertook a low-resolution analysis photography, recording 60 A using oscillation (1 A = @I nm) data from a native crystal and a crystal each of a K,PtCl, and a K3U02F, derivative (Lim & Mathews, unpublished results). We obtained a two-site solution for the platinum derimethods procedure vative using the direct MULTAN (Woolfson, 1982) and subsequently a two-site solution for the uranium derivative by difference-Fourier methods. Data were remeasured from several crystals using a Picker diffractometer, with Friedel-related reflections recorded at + 28. Single isomorphous replacement (s.i.r.t) phases were computed from each derivative in three ways, with anomalous scattering omitted and included in both enantiomeric space groups P3r21 and P3221. Crossdifference Fourief maps phased by s.i.r. with anomalous scattering in space group P3,21 gave clearer peaks at the expected heavy-atom positions than did maps phased without anomalous scattering or maps phased in P3121. The s.i.r. phases in P3,21 with anomalous scattering were combined and used to compute a multiple isomorphous replacement (m.i.r.) map at 6.0 A resolution. The electron density map showed large channels through the crystal lattice, in agreement with the image reconstruction results from electron microscopy (Olive et al., 1973), but could not be otherwise interpreted. Attempts to isolate a single tetramer by viewing it, along the crystallographic 2-fold axis were unsuccessful. The generally weak scattering from the crystals, coupled with the inefficient geometry of the single-counter diffractometer and the relatively low heavy-atom occupancy, prevented the correct interpretation of the low resolution map (see below). The present' paper describes the successful structure analysis of flavocytochrome b, at 3.0 A resolution using area detector data (Xuong et al.. 1985b) and new, highly substituted, heavy-atom derivatives. The protein structure and some mechanistic: discussions, based on refinement' at 2.4 A resolution using data recorded on film (described in detail elsewhere) are also presented. A preliminary report of the structure, based on a tracing of the polypeptide chain in a minimap, has been presented (Xia et al., 1987). One of the most salient feat'ures of structure therein reported was that the molecule possesses 4-fold symmetry, with the 4-fold axis coincident with the crystallographic P-fold axis and that the asymmetric unit contains only two protomers. This indicated that the rotation function results were incorrect and explained some of the difficulties we had in interpreting the early low-resolution results.

2. Structure Analysis
(a) Crystal properties Crystals of intact flavocytochrome b,, prepared from commercial baker's yeast in t,he presence of 1 mM-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at all stages of purification, were grown by microdialysis as described previously (Mathews & Lederer, 1976). The protein, pelleted from 70"/0 saturated ammonium sulfate, was initially dissolved at a concent,racontaining tion of 0*50/, to 0750/b in a solution 50 rnM-phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 50 mM-n,I,lactate and 1 mM-EDTA. The protein solution was t,hen dialyzed, in capillary tubes 10 mm long by 3 mm diameter, closed at both ends by dialysis membranes. at 4"C, against approximately 30 to pentane 2-methyl-2,4-methyl 330/b (v/v) diol (MPD), 70 mlrr-phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 47 mM-n,L-lactate. 1 mM-EDTA.

They diffract to a maximum resolution of about 2.4 8. Four crystals were used for density measurement,s in a bromobenzene-xylene density gradient column 1952). The crystals were first (1,ow &, Richards, transferred from the MPD-containing mother liquor and equilibrated against a solution of 12:; polyet,hylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 10 mM-phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 10 mM-n,L-lactate.

This yielded an average molecular weight of 118.000 in thtl asytrlmetric unit and a solvent caontent of 0.68 (Matthews. 1974). Thcb above result is in striking contrast to that, reported previously (Mat)hews & Lederer, 1976). It1 the earlier experiments, the crystals warp crosslinked with glutaraldehyde and equilibrated against distilled water and indicated an average den&y of 1.23 g/cm3. This led to a calculated molecula~t weight of 249.000 ptxr asymmetric unit. cbotrsistent with a full t,etramer in the asymmebri(a unit.

This might have resulted in the crystals absorbing the organic phase into the crystal lattice. causing the crystals to appear abnormally dense.

During t'he early low-resolution studies, three heavy-atom derivatives were found. These were K,Pt,Cl,. TrCl, and IJO:+ (Table 1). However, the intensity changes produced by these compounds

were difficult to reproduce, particularly for iridium. Futhermore, the uranyl salts produced a fiber diffraction pattern superimposed on the diffraction pattern from the crystals. Approximately 150 new soaking experiments were carried out in an effort to improve the conditions for heavy-atom substitution. About half the experiments, including all those in which mercurial reagents were tested, resulted in loss of the crystalline diffraction pattern. No conditions could be found in which the original three compounds could study. be used in the high-resolution Two compounds were found, cis-Pt(NH,),Cl, and Na,IrCl,, which gave reproducible changes and maintained a good diffraction pattern. Neither derivative was very sensitive to soaking time or reagent concentration. However, both required that the soaks be carried out in 35% (v/v) hexane diol, since soaking in the presence of MPD either led to degradation of the crystals or produced smaller intensity changes. NaJrCl, caused large crystals to crack unless the mother liquor was changed gradually over a four hour period and the temperature was kept constant in a cold room. The conditions for heavy-atom preparation are given in Table 1.

and processing

Four datasets were collected at the UCSD Area et al., 19856) in about Detector Facility (Xuong 2.5 weeks. The crystals were routinely mounted in thin-walled glass capillaries, surrounded by an artificial mother liquor and held in place by cotton fibers obtained by shaving pipe cleaners wit'h a scalpel. This procedure greatly increased the limit of diffraction and the lifetime of the crystals in the X-ray beam. and prevent)ed them from slipping. The crystals were maintained at about 0 to 5°C by a cold nitrogen gas stream. The native and t.he cis-Pt(NH,),Cl, datasets were each completed using one crystal. The Na,IrCl, data were recorded from two crystals because of excessive crystal decay during data collection. The latter two set's were largely complementary and were treated separately throughout all stages of refinement and phase calculation to avoid effects caused by differences in heavy-atom substitution. Two Hamlin (Hamlin et al., 1981) detectors were used at' +20 and placed about 800 mm from the crystal. For all crystals a number of scans ranging from 49" to 71' in o at different orientations in 4 and x were recorded. This was done to provide full coverage of reciprocal space with a high degree of redundancy (Xuong et al. 1985a). Several scans with the centers of each detector at +21" and -21" in 20, respectively (providing a maximum resolution of 2.9 A), were used to record the high-resolution data. followed by three scans with the detectors at + 11" and - 16" to record the low-resolution data. For the high-resolution native and &Pt(NH,),Cl, datasets, six and eight orientations were used, respectively, while four orientations were

For each diffraction used for each Na,IrCl, peak, nine contiguous steps of width 0.10" to 612" in omega were integrated. datasets were scaled internally by The individual data recorded from each detector at subdividing into blocks of 5" increments in o each orientation (Howard et al., 1985). This allowed local int,ensity variations caused by absorption and radiation damage to be minimized by the scaling procedure. About 10; of the reflections that differed significantly from the average were discarded on an individual basis. In addition, about S:/, of t,he data from one of the Na,IrCl, derivatives were discarded because of a shadow falling on one of the detectors. The individual blocks of data for each crystal were resealed using a 13 term polynomial for each block (Nielsen, personal communication) to allow foi intensity variations across the face of each detector. This polynomial scaling resulted in a 0.600 to 09O,;, improvement in residual R-factor. The dat'a collection statistics and residual R-fact#ors for each dataset are summarized in Table 2. Each of the datasets, reduced to point. group 321 to preserve anomalous scattering differences were locally scaled (Matthews & Czerwinski. 1975) to minimize systematic differences between the Friedel pairs. A modificat'ion of the ROCKS cr@allographic computing program (Reeke. 1984), adapted to the \`A9 computer (Bethge, 1984) was used. Analysis of the results of the Friedel local scaling indicated a slight reduction of systematic differences between Friedel pairs for the t,wo NazIrCl, datasets (Table 3). The three derivat>ive dat,aset,s were then each locally scaled to the native data. again using the ROCKS program. Tn this case, there was a significant reduction in the syst,emat.ic differences between the native and the derivative datasets (Table 3).

At 6.0 A resolution, only the occupancy and positional parameters were varied; the thermal parameters were held fixed at zero. The space group was assumed at, this point t'o be P3,21 on the basis of earlier lowresolution studies (our unpublished results). s.i.r. phases based on the first Ir derivative and employing the two Ir sites were used to compute a Pt cross difference-Fourier map. This map gave t,he position of the major Pt sit'e relative to the lr sites plus one minor site. Anomalous difference-Fourier maps (Strahs & Kraut. 1968) for the Na,TrCl, and cis-Pt(NH,),Cl, derivatives based on s.i.r. phases were calculated from the refined pairs of Pt and Ir sites, respectively. This map contained large positive peaks at the expected positions, verifying the correctness of the choice of space group P3*21. m.i.r. phases based on the two derivatives were computed and used to compute difference maps for all three derivative crystals. The Pt map and the two Tr maps showed clearly the expected pairs of major peaks but no minor sit'es. The two Ir sites were then refined in the second Ir derivative with the program HEAVY.

(ii) Mok!eula~ symmetry Since the asymmetric unit of the flavocytochrome b, crystal lattice contains half a tetramer, a molecular 2-fold axis is constrained to be coincident with one of the crystallographic S-fold axis. In order to locate the orientation of the molecular symmetry elements more easily, the trigonal lattice containing the 6.0 A resolution electron density function was transformed so that the map could be plotted in sections normal to a crystallographic 2-fold axis (Bricogne, 1976). When the transformed electron density sections were examined, the molecular boundary could be clearly discerned Furthermore, the molecule was seen to possess 4-fold symmetry throughout most of the molecular envelope. The two major iridium-binding sites as well as two of the four platinum-binding sites were also found t,o obey the local 4-fold symmetry. In sections close to the single iron at,om site, the local 4-fold symmetry is obeyed only within a circle of about 30 a radius centered on the 4-fold axis. Beyond that radius, only the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry is obeyed. In particular, the strong electron density encompassing the iron atom and corresponding to the cytochrome domain is absent.

The 3.0 A electron density function was modified by the phase filtering procedure of Wang (1985). In this procedure, an envelope is generated that separates volumes in the crystal lattice containing the protein molecule from volumes containing the solvent. This is done by applying a smoothing function to the electron density. A threshold is then chosen so that the sum of volume elements corresponding to solvent equals the solvent content of the crystal determined experimentally. Often a value for the solvent content that is slightly smaller than the true one is used in this procedure to reduce the chance of having external loops or side-chains t,runcated. In the case of flavocytochrome b,, the observed solvent content, SS%, was used rat,her than a slightly more conservative value, since about 10% of the protein volume, corresponding to one To ensure that cyt'ochrome domain, is disordered. t,he phase-filtering procedure had not, artificially reduced the density of the disordered domain, the unmodified map was carefully examined. In fact, no evidence of any ordered protein structure was found in the disordered region. Nine cycles of phase filtering were carried out, during which three separate molecular envelopes were calculated. The overall figure of merit improved from 0.29 and 0.71, with an accumulated phase shift of 53". The phase-filtering statistics are given in Table 6. The phase-filtering procedure produced a marked improvement in the quality of the electron density in Figure 4. Examination of map, as indicated portions of the final 3.0 A structure (Fig. 5) indicated that there was little truncation of external

procedure. The averaged map was used for tracing the chain and fitting the electron density of the flavin-binding domain. The reoriented map that had not been averaged was used to trace and fit the ordered cytochrome domain in subunit I and to verify that certain weak and disordered regions of the flavin-binding domain behaved similarly in the two subunits. Except for the presence of a ligand at the active site subunit 2 and for a slight difference in the extent, of disorder of a short peptide (see below) the flavin-binding domains of the two subunits were essentially the same.

Care was taken to ensure that sufficient solvent and protein densities were included on the transparencies to encompass two complete subunits. The path of the polypeptide chain was manually traced in the minimap. Prominent side-chains were visually correlated with the known amino acid sequence to keep the chain in register. As indicated in the low resolution map, electron density for the cytochrome domain, comprising the first 99 residues was completely absent in subunit 2. Furt.hermore. in the unaveraged map the electron density of the cytochrome domain of subunit' 1 was generally weaker than that of the flavin-binding domain. Consequently the path of the polypeptide chain in the cytochrome domain was more difficult to follow and less confidence could be placed in the resulting

model at certain places where the electron density was especially weak. The heme and FMN groups were easily identified as isolated pieces of electron density of characteristic shape (Fig. 6). The density corresponding to the heme was centered approximately on the position of the iron atom as determined from the anomalous scattering difference-Fourier map. An additional isolated piece of electron density was found in the unaveraged map near the flavin group but only in the subunit containing the disordered cytochrome domain. This piece was tentatively identified as a ligand, probably pyruvate, bound at the active site of the enzyme. The positions of the C" atoms estimated from the minimap were used to display the general conformation of the molecule and to serve as a starting point for fitting a full atomic model to the electron density map on the MMS-X molecular graphics system (Barry et al., 1974). The protein molecule was divided into short segments of polypeptide chain six to eight residues in length. Contours corresponding to these segments were prepared using the molecular graphics program NEWNTP (Lederer et aE., 1981). For each contoured segment of the polypeptide chain, the co-ordinates of an atomic model were generated using the program BUILD (Miller et al., 1981), having the same amino acid sequence as that segment but in arbitrary a-helical conformation. Each model segment was matched to the density of NEWNIP by torsional rotations about single bonds. The co-ordinates from all segments were combined into a single file and regularized by the Hermans & McQueen (1974) energy minimization procedure using the program TOM, a modification of FRODO (Jones, 1985) designed to operate on the Silicon Graphics IRIS graphics system (Cambillau, personal communication). Contours for the heme, flavin and pyruvate groups were generated in a similar manner using coordinates for several points positioned arbitrarily in the corresponding density in the minimap. Skeletal models for these groups were then fitted into the

electron density on the MMS-X system by rotating about single bonds. (h) Extension and wfinement at 8.4 i-r resolution, The atomic co-ordinates of flavocytochrome b, t,he HendricksonKonnert refined by were restrained least-squares procedure (Hendrickson. was carried out, using t,hr 1985). Refinement program PROFIT (Finzel, 1987) first at 3.0 A resolution; using the UCSD area detector data and later at 2.4 A resolution using data recorded on photographic film at a synchrotron (Xia et al., unpublished results). A total of 81 refinement, cycles were carried out during which the model was rebuilt fivr times using TOM on the IRIS graphics computer. The final residual R-factor was 0.188 for 61.365 reflections between 5.0 and 2.4 A resolution. The two subunits were refined independently and a t,ot,al of 283 water molecules were included in the final model. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation from ideal bond lengths was O-014 A. Details of the refinement will be published elsewhere. The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Chemistry Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973, IJ.S.A. 3. Results and Discussion (a) Overall description of the molecule Each subunit of flavocytochrome bz consists of two discrete domains, an N-terminal cytochrome domain from residues 1 to 99 and a (I-terminal flavin-binding domain from residues 100 to 486. In addition there is an extended C-terminal tail from residues 487 to 511. The tetramer of flavocytochrome bzr shown in Figure 7, consists of four subunits arranged about a molecular 4-fold axis of symmetry. The four flavinbinding domains pack together about the molecular 4-fold axis to form an oblate disk about 100 A in diameter and about 60 A thick. The C-terminal tails extend away from their parent domains at the bottom of the molecules, wrap about the 4-fold axis

The 2 disordered cytochrome domains are drawn in broken lines while the C-terminal tail near the center of the tetramer, residues 487 to 511, is drawn in heavy bold. The heme and FMN groups are intermediate bold, to form a right'-handed /?-annulus and emerge at the top of the molecule, making successive contact with each of the other subunits. The arrangement of the C-terminal tails is indicated in Figure 7. The cytochrome domains are located on the outer edge of the protruding away from the 4-fold axis and tetramer tetramer, lie above the mid plane of the ellipsoidal as shown in Figure 8. They form no intersubunit contacts. The two independent cytochrome domains in the crystallographic asymmetric unit' behave differently. One is relatively well ordered in the crystal lattice. while t'he other is disordered, being completely absent from the electron density map. On the other hand, the two independent flavin-binding domains are quite similar in structure. In both subunits, residues from positions 100 to 299 and from 317 to 511 are ordered. Residues 300 to 311 are disordered in both subunits, while residues 312 to 316 are disordered in subunit 1 and ordered in subunit 2. The conformation of two dipeptides, 298 to 299 and 510 to 511 are poorly ordered in the two subunits. When the remaining 391 C" co-ordinates of the t'wo subunits are optimally aligned (Rao & Rossmann, 1973). the r.m.s. deviation in positions is 0.36 A. The amino acid sequence of flavocytochrome b, is shown in Figure 9. The structural analysis program IHSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983), was used, along of computer graphics with visual inspection displays, to delineate the secondary structure shown diagramatically also in Figure 9. About 40% of the amino acid residues are in a helical conformation and about IS?;, are in P-sheet. A topological diagram of the flavin-binding domain showing the arrangement of secondary structural elements is presented in Figure 10. The cytochrome domain (Fig. 11(a)) consists of a six-stranded mixed P-sheet (5 strands in one direct'ion, 1 in the other), with a single helix lying on one side. On the other side of the sheet are t,wo pairs of antiparallel helices that form t,he heme-binding pocket'. Three of the six P-strands contain only a single hydrogen bond to an adjacent strand and are labeled 8' in Figure 9. Two of the helices (labeled CI') were not' identified by IXSP hut caould be recognized visually. The structure of the cybochrome domain is similar to that of cytochrome b, (Fig. 11). This observation verifies the structural homology predicted on the basis of the amino acid sequence similarity and supports the hypothesis of a single basic protein fold for all members of the cytochrome b, family (Guiard & Lederer. 1979; see Introduction). The major structural differences between cyt,ochromes b, and of helix V in the two b, core are the orientation structures and the replacement of helix 6 in b5 by an extended chain and P-sheet segment in b, core. Differences also occur in the relative heme orientat,ions and the solvent exposure of t,he propionic acid groups. Detailed comparison of t#he two cytochromes will be presented elsewherta. Thr tlavin-binding domain contains a parallel &cls barrel structure (Fig. IO) similar t'o that first observed in triose phosphate isomerase (Phillips et al., 1978). This barrel structlure is contained within the segment of residues 191 to 465. as indicated in Figure 9,

The t,wo independent FMN groups of fiavocvkchrome b, are very similar in conformation.

Most of the deviations between the two groups are localized in the phosphate regions. During refinement, the flavin ring was allowed to adopt a "butterfly" conformation by restraining its atoms to lie in one or t,he other of two planes containing the pyrimidine and benzenoid rings. respectively, with atoms N-5 and N-10 common to both planes (Fig. 12). The flavin ring is clearly bent, the "butterfly" angle between the planes being about 172". The r.m.s. distance of the pyrimidine and benzenoid ring atoms from their respective planes is about 0.04 A (Table 7), while the deviation

ring is tilted barrel. The plane of the isoalloxazine by about 55" with respect to the axis of the b-barrel. The O-2 atom lies closest to this axis. The isoalloxazine ring lies with its re face against P-strand 1. The phosphate group lies between P-strands 7 and 8 close to the N terminus of helix H (Fig. 13). The FMN is almost completely buried in the flavin-binding domain of flavocytochrome 6,. The only atoms of FMN with any appreciable exposure to solvent are C-4A, N-5 and C-5A (Fig. 12) on one edge of the isoalloxazine ring and, to a slight extent', one of the phosphate oxygen atoms. The remaining atoms of FMN, which are of a polar or hydrogenbinding nature, interact with polar main- or sidechain atoms of the protein. These interactions are shown in Figure 14(a) and (b) and listed for both subunits in Table 8. In addition there is an internal hydrogen bond between the ribose O-4* and a phosphate oxygen. All the polar or hydrogen-bonded interactions between the protein and FMN involve atoms t,hat are locat'ed in six of the eight P-strands. In two of these strands, fil and /Js, the interactions involve main-chain atoms only. Four of the buried sidechains that, interact with FMN normally carry a positive or negative charge at neutral pH. Two of these art? Arg413 in strand /?., and Arg433 in strand both of which interact, with the B 8> respectively, negatively charged phosphate group. ;I third charged group is Asp409 (/-I,), which interacts with the hydroxyl group at position O-3* of the ribose chain. The fourth charged side-chain is Lys319. It interacts with N-l and O-2 atoms of the isoalloxazine ring and with the hydroxyl group at position O-2* of the ribose moiety. This interaction, especially in the low-dielectric, solvent-inaccessible environment of

the protein interior, has a very important effect on t,he chemical properties of the protein-bound FMN. Such an interaction has been proposed to account for stabilization by inductive effects of the anionic form of the flavin semiquinone and hydroquinone and for the enhanced reactivity of sulfite to the N-5 position of the flavin ring in a number of flavoenzymes (Massey & Hemmerich. 1980). These properties were used as a means of distinguishing the dehydrogenase-oxidase class of flavoenzyme, which possessed them. from the dehydrogenasr-electron transferase class. which did not. However. flavocytochrome h,. a dehydrogenase-electron transferase, is known to stabilize the anionic semiquinone flavin radical (Capiellkre-Blandin et aZ., 1975: Tegoni Pt al.. 1984) and to bind sulfite with high affinity at' the N-5 position (Lederer, 1974; Tegoni & Mathews, 1988). Lys349 is quite likely to he responsible for these effects, and may also play a

role in the catalytic mechanism as well by helping to stabilize a carbanion intermediate. The chemical of this electron transferasr to the similarities oxidases is compatible with the striking structural similarity b, flavin-binding of the flavocytochrome domain to glycolate oxidase, as described below. Thus the basis for the differences in the mode of electron transfer by these two classes of flavoenzymes must reside in more subtle &ructural differences. The other specific interactions between the protein and FMN are hydrogen bonds between main-chain or side-chain atoms and the FMN. Two of the main-chain hydrogen bonds to FMIV involve oxygen of residue 196 and the amide the carbonyl nitrogen of residue 198. both located in b-strand I, These atoms interact with atoms O-2* and N-5 of FMN, respectively (Fig. 14). The other tjwo interactions involve the two peptide amide nit.rogrn

Thus the double negative charge of the phosphate moiety of FMN is neutralized by two arginine side-chains, by the dipole of helix H (Fig. 13) and by charge delocalization through hydrogen bonds to the peptide backbone.
(c) Ligand binding

After the fiavin-binding domain was init,ially fitted to the averaged 3.0 electron density map, the models for subunits 1 and 2 were compared with the unaveraged electron density. In the vicinity of the flavin ring, an unexplained peak was discovered in subunit 2. which was absent in subunit I. This

peak, shown in Figure 15, was approximately the same size as either lactate or pyruvate and was interpreted to be a bound ligand at the active site. The ligand is more likely to be pyruvate, since pyruvate is known to have a higher affinity for the reduced enzyme than lactate (Urban & Lederer, 1984). The center of the density is located near the N&containing edge of the flavin ring, about 4 A below the plane of the ring (Fig. 15). The relationship of the bound ligand to the flavin ring and the flavin-binding domain is shown in Figure Iti. The assignment of the isolated densit#y to pyruvate has been supported by refinement, at 24 I! resolution and by biophysical studies of th<h crystalline enzyme. For several cycles of refinement. the pyruvate molecule of subunit' 2 was not restrained

to be planar and the dihedral angle of the central bond, between C-l and C-2, was allowed to vary. The value of this torsional angle converged to a value about 20" from planarity and the group was restrained to be planar for the remainder of the refinement. Attempts to refine a molecule of pyruvate in subunit 1 were unsuccessful and the difference electron density in the corresponding location was best explained as a cluster of water molecules. The composition of the mother liquor of the crystals grown originally in 47 InM-D,L-htate has been found to contain about 2 mM-pyruvate (Urban & Lederer, personal communication), which has probably arisen from slow turnover of the crystalline enzyme, with oxygen acting as the electron acceptor. Flavocytochrome b, from H. anomala has a high affinity for pyruvate when the flavin is in the semiquinone form (Tegoni et al., 1986). In fact, pyruvate appears to stabilize the semiquinone form of the enzyme by modulation of the redox potential of the flavin group. Preliminary electron spin resonance experiments indicate that crystals of the Naccharomycea enzyme contain a significant signal from the flavin semiquinone radical (Henri et al., unpublished results). These results are consistent with pyruva.te as the ligand and with half of the flavin being in the semiquinone form. The chemical environment of the pyruvate molecule is shown in Figure 17. The plane of the pyruvate molecule is approximately parallel to that' of the flavin ring. It is oriented so that one of the two carboxyl oxygen atoms can form a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr143, while the other oxygen can form a hydrogen bond with NE of Arg376. The buried positive charge of the latter group thus helps to st'abilize the negative charge of the carboxylate anion. The other two amino groups of the Arg376 side-chain interact with three peptide carbonyl atoms of helix ax,. The keto oxygen atom of pyruvate interacts both with Tvr254 OH and His373 NE2. This histidine residue also interacts with the carboxylate of Asp282 through the NE1 position. This latter inter-

As discussed in Introduction, the rate-limiting step in the flavocytochrome b,-catalyzed oxidation of lactate is the extraction of the cc-hydrogen from the substrate. In principle, this can occur in three different ways, by hydride transfer directly to the flavin, by a radical mechanism, in which a hydrogen atom is transferred to the enzyme and by transfer of the a-proton to the enzyme. This last possibility would leave an electron remaining on the C" and result in formation of a transiently stable carbanion. A large body of chemical evidence favors the mechanism, for flavocytochrome b, carbanion (Lederer & Mathews, 1987; Lederer, 1990) and for similar enzymes (Ghisla, several other functionally 1982). The possible role of several of the amino acids located at the active site, found to interact with pyruvate, have been proposed (Lederer & Mathews, 1987). Lys349 and Tyr143 (Fig. 17) would stabilize binding of the lactate carboxylate through ionic and hydrogen bonding, as in the case of pyruvate. The substrate hydroxyl group could form a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl oxygen atom of Tyr254. His373 would then be in position for its epsilon nitrogen atom to abstract the a-proton of the substrate (Fig. 17). The resulting imidazolium ion would be stabilized by interaction of the delta nitrogen with Asp282. Since the C" of lactate is tetrahedral, these last two steps would require small movements of the Tyr254 and His373 side-chains relative to the binding of the planar pyruvate molecule. The stability of the carbanion intermediate and the question of whether electron transfer then proceeds ,via a two-electron or two closely spaced one-electron steps or via a covalent intermediate linking of the C" proton of lactate to the N-5 atom of FMN has been discussed (Ghisla &, Massey, 1989). For a covalent intermediate to form? the (I" of the
lactate oarbanion intermediate would need to be

located about 2 A closer to the N-5 atom of the flavin t)han the position 37 A away observed in t,he pyruvate complex.

(e) Comparison of the catalytic sitr in the two subunits The flavocytochrome b, crystal st,ructure is unique in having the two functionally identical subunits of the asymmetric unit in quite distinct structural states. Tn subunit 1, where the heme and flavin-binding domains are relatively well ordered, the active site contains only water molecules. In subunit 2, where the cytochrome domain is disordered, the active site contains one molecule of pyruvate. the product of t,he forward reaction.

Figure 18. Superposition of the active sites of subunits 1 (solid lines) and 2 (broken lines). The view is parallel vision stereoscopic. The 2 active sites were aligned using the program HOMO (Rao & Rossmann, 1973). Only 1 heme propionate group is present and the pyruvate ligand (broken lines) is replaced by 4 water molecules (indicated by x ) in subunit 1. Otherwise, the two flavin-binding domains are quite similar. There are five residues in the active site, Tyr143, Tyr254, Asp282, His373 and Arg376, which are involved in the binding of pyruvate in subunit 2. The C" and side-chain atoms of these five residues, plus the atoms of FMN were matched in the two subunits (Rao & Rossmann, 1973). The r.m.s. deviation between the 69 matched atoms is 926 A. The superposition of these two active sites is shown in Figure 18. Included in the Figure is the pyruvate of subunit 2, a heme propionate in subunit 1 and four water molecules in subunit 1, which occupy approximately the site that pyruvate does in subunit 2. The largest deviation in position occurs for Tyr143, which has an r.m.s. deviation of about 0.4 A between the two matched subunits. There are no obvious conformational differences between the two active sites that can readily account for the difference in ligand binding or possible difference in redox state of the flavin. The only striking difference between the two active sites is
OlA

the presence of the heme propionate group in subunit 1. Since this group is negatively charged and forms a hydrogen bond to Tyr143 (see below) it may alter the electrostatic environment of the active site and reduce the affinity for pyruvate. (f) Heme environmen,t The heme group is located in the cytochrome domain in a pocket formed by two pairs of helices and the mixed b-sheet (Fig. 11(a)). The heme is held in place by co-ordination to the NE atoms of two histidine side-chains at positions 43 and 66 (Fig. 9). The heme group is oriented with the two vinyl groups, on pyrrole rings B and C (Fig. 19) positioned at the base of the heme-binding pocket, which contains the mixed /?-sheet. It makes contact

with about) ten non-polar residues of the cytochrome domain, in addit,ion to the two histidine ligands (Table 9). The propionate groups, on rings A and D (Fig. IY), are directed away from the cytochrome domain, toward the flavin-binding domain. They interact directly with three side-chains located in the flavin-binding domain or the interdomain loop three water molecules (Fig. 20). One and with propionate group (from ring D) makes hydrogen and ionic bonds with the side-chains of Tyr97 and Lys296 and with two water molecules. One of these waters (W685) is bridged to the ion pair Asp2921 Arg289. The other water (W685) is bridged to the second propionate, from ring A. This second propionate also interacts with Tyr143 and with the third water molecule (W664). Finally the latter forms a bridge to atoms O-4 and N-5 of the flavin ring. During the refinement, the atoms of each pyrrole ring were restrained to be planar, but the relative orientations of the four pyrrole rings were allowed to vary. The results of the refinements yielded a heme group that is only slightly non-planar. The r.m.s. deviation of the atoms of the porphyrin ring from a single plane defined by the inner ring of 16 atoms surrounding the central iron atom, is 010 A. The largest deviations from coplanarity occur for rings A and 11. (g) Interactions between domains

ic) Figure 21. Three orthogonal flavin groups of flavocytochrome
views of the heme and b, in isolation.

In subunit, 1 the cytochrome and flavin-binding domains are well ordered and in close contact. They are linked covalently between residues 99 and 100. This somewhat arbitrary demarcation of the two domains was chosen because the ordered flavinbinding domain of subunit 2 begins at position 100. In subunit 1. these two residues are part' of a three-

turn structure (Kabsch & Sander, 1983), containing residues Ala98 to GlulOl, which span t,he t,wo domains and give rise to local interact,ions bet!ween the two domains. Three orthogonal views of the fla,vin and heme groups in isolation are shown in Figure 21. The flavin ring is tilted by about 20" with respect to the mean plane of the heme. The iron atom of the heme is 13.9 A from the flavin N-5 atom. The closest approach of the porphyrin ring to the flavin ring is 97 8, from C-2A of the heme to N-5 of the flavin. The heme propionate group of pyrrole ring IV is somewhat closer to the flavin ring. The distance from O-1A of the propionate to the flavin N-5 is 5.7 A. These two atoms are bridged by a water molecule (W664) as described above. The long-range interactions between the cgtochrome and flavin-binding domains involve both hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interact'ions. There are nine residues plus the heme of the cytochrome domain in contact with 15 residues of the flavin-binding domain. In addition, there are five water molecules that bridge the two domains. The specific interdomain interactions for t'he uytochrome, the flavin-binding domain and the bridging water molecules are listed in Table IOA to (,`. Three residues of the cytochrome domain, along with the two propionate groups of the heme. are involved in direct interdomain hydrogen bonds with six residues of the flavin-binding domain. One of

these, between Lys296 and a heme propionate group, is also a salt bridge, the only one between the two domains. On the other hand, nine residues of the cytochrome domain plus the heme group and ten residues of the flavin-binding domain are involved in a non-polar van der Waals' interactions. The solvent accessible surface area (Lee & Richards, 1971) calculated for the entire subunit 1 is about 850 8' smaller than that calculated for both of the isolated domains. About 200 A2 is this difference is accounted for by coverage of the heme group by the flavin-binding domain. There is no change in solvent accessibility for the flavin group. One of the five bridging water molecules connects a heme propionate group to two polar ring atoms of the flavin ring, as described in section (f), above. A second water molecule bridges a main-chain atom from the cytochrome domain to ttwo main-chain atoms of the flavin-binding domain. The three remaining water molecules bridge single atoms (main, side-chain or propionate) between the two domains. Thus the balance between hydrogenbonding and ionic interactions T)erCTus non-polar interactions between the two domains appears to be about equal.

The flavocytochrome b, st'ructure provides the first detailed observation of a natural electron transfer complex between a cytochrome and a flavoprotein. A number of theoretical models for this and similar types of complexes have been proposed,

Molecular Structure of Flavocytochrome b,
notably, for flavodoxin-cytochrome c (Simondsen et al., 1982), cytochrome b,-cytochrome c (Salemme, 1976) and cytochrome b,-hemoglobin (Poulos & Mauk, 1983). The major features of these models are that the surface topology and charge distributions of the interacting proteins are complementary and that the prosthetic groups are approximately coplanar. The minimum distance between porphyrin ring atoms in the models for the cytochrome b, complexes is about 8 to 10 A, whereas the heme and FMN groups are in van der Waals' contact in t,he model for the flavodoxin-cytochrome c complex. Many of the predicted features of these models are compatible with the observed structure of flavothe minimum distance cytochrome b,. Here, between the heme and flavin rings is 97 A and the rings are approximately coplanar. The surfaces of the two domains are complementary, sharing an interface area of about 400 A'. However. there is little charge complementarity between the two only a single salt bridge. The with domains, majority of the stabilization occurs through hydrogen bond and van der Waals' interactions. This difference from the models of the complexes is a natural result of the covalent linkage between the b,. Additional two domains of flavocytochrome stabilization of an electron complex by complementary charge interactions should only be needed for separate protein molecules. The rate of electron transfer within a complex is dependent upon a number of factors such as the distance between donor and acceptor, their relative orientation, the nature of the intervening material, the thermodynamic driving force and the reorganization energy at the donor and acceptor redox centers (Marcus & Sutton, 1985). The distance and orientation parameters in flavocytochrome b, are consistent with those expected for other electron transfer partners (Dixon, 1988). The electron transfer pathway is apparently "through space" at least part, of the way, since there is no covalent bonding between the two domains, However, the heme propionate of ring D does connect via a water bridge to the flavin ring (Fig. 20). The only aromatic group bridging the two prothetic groups is Tyr143. which might provide a "hopping" pathway for the electron. The driving force for electron transfer from either the fully reduced flavin or the flavin semiquinone bo the heme is relatively small, of the order of 60 mV (Capeillere-Blandin et al., 1975). Under these conditions the activation energy for electron transfer will be largely determined by the reorganization energy of electron transfer (Dixon, 1988). It has been suggested that the reorganization energy for metalloprotein electron transfer in "long-range electron transferases" will tend to be minimized by adopting environments midway between those favored by the oxidized and reduced metal cofactors (Mayo et aZ., 1986). This situation may apply to flavocytlochrome 6,. No change in protein conformation was observed, at least at, 3.0 A resolution. when crystals

857

were allowed to oxidize in air (Tegoni & Mathews, 1988). Thus in both heme oxidation states and in all three flavin oxidation states (as observed in the native and oxidized crystals) the struct'ures and environments of the cofactors are unchanged, indicating that) reorganization energies should be relatively small. (i) Intrrprotomer

electron transfer

Under anaerobic conditions and in the absence of electron acceptors, each tetramer of flavocytoa t,ot#al of 12 chrome b, is capable of receiving electrons from six molecules of the substrate lactate. These electrons would be distributed over the prosthetic groups, eight for the four flavins and four for the four heme groups. Since lactate must transfer two electrons at once to an oxidized flavin species, oxidation of the fifth and sixth molecules of lactate must require electron rearrangement, between prosthetic groups in different protomers. Stopped-flow studies of heme reduction and disappearance of oxidized flavin under the abovementioned conditions showed biphasic kinetics (Capeilltre-Blandin et al., 1975). The first phase was complete in about 35 milliseconds (at 24" for the cleaved enzyme) and corresponded to uptake, by the enzyme, of two electrons per protomer. The second phase was about 20-fold slower than the first and corresponded to uptake of a third electron per protomer. The slow phase is not involved in the catalytic turnover of the enzyme. In the reaction scheme proposed. the fast phase involves intraprotomer electron transfer from reduced flavin to oxidized heme group with a rate constant of approximat'ely 500 per second. Further kinetic studies (Pompon et aZ., 1980) and simulation studies (Pompon, 1980) have verified the nature of the fast reaction phase and led to a more detailed reaction scheme for the overall reduction in which interprotomer electron transfer occurs much more slowly t)han the intraprotomer transfer. of the order of 1 to 10 per second. Figure 22 shows the various distances among heme and flavin cofactors in the flavocytochrome b, tetramer. The shortest distance between flavin rings on adjacent subunits is about 38 A. compared to the closest contact) between heme and flavin rings of 9.7 A in the same protomer. Thus the relatively slow interprotomer electron transfer observed in the kinetic studies is consistent with the structure of the tetramer.

Hromolactate is a simple substrate for flavocytochrome b,. On the other hand, bromopyruvat'e. the product of t'he reaction, will inactivate t,he enzyme in a manner characteristic of an afinity label for the act'ive site (Mulet & Lederer. 1975). The enzyme can be protected from inactivation by pretreatment with substrate, reducing agent or inhibitors of catalysis. Radioactive labeling of previously protected enzyme that had been labeled by non-radioactive bromopyruvate resulted in radiolabeling of a few cysteine residues after partial loss of enzymatic activity (Alliel et nl., 1980). Sequence analysis of peptide digests (Alliel et al., 1982) indicated that most of the radiolabel was distributed among three cysteine residues, at positions 200, 216 and 233: with Cys233 carrying about twice the amount of label as the ot.her two cysteines. These results were interpreted as indicating that Cys233 is located in t'he active site, although all three cysteine residues appear to be protected from bromopyruvate attack when substrate or inhibitors are bound at the active site. 2-Hydroxy-Sbutynoic acid is a suicide substrate for flavocytochrome b, (I,ederer, 1974).

Furthermore, the phosphate group of the FMN molecule interacts with an a-helix at nearly identical positions in all three enzymes. The C" chains of flavocytochrome b, and glycolate oxidase are folded into very similar conformations & Branden, (Mathews & Xia, 1987; Lindquist personal communication). A detailed comparison of &uctures will be presented elsewhere their (Branden et al., unpublished results). On the other hand, the conformation of the flavin-binding dehydrogenase is somedomain of trimethylamine what different from that of flavocytochrome b2. The amino acid sequence of trimethylamine dehydrogenase is unknown. However, a hypothetical sequence based on the electron density map (Mathews & Lim, 1987) suggests that the main-chain and side-chain interactions of FMN with the protein of trimethylamine dehydrogenase is quite similar to that in flavocytochrome b,, despite the larger overall variation\ of tertiary structure. (ii) Flavodozin Flavodoxin is a small bacterial electron transfer protein about 150 amino acid residues length. The structures of three flavodoxins have been determined to high resolution (Ludwig et al., 1982). This class of protein is monomeric and contains FMN as the redox active cofactor. In all three proteins the polypeptide chain is folded into a single domain of the parallel a/? "nucleotide binding" motif with a central five-stranded parallel b-strand flanked by a-helices. The binding site for FMN is quite similar in the three flavodoxins. It differs considerably from that in flavocytochrome b2 in a number of ways. The FMN lies at one end of the /?-sheet, with the pyrimidine ring portion, which is most deeply buried, inserted between two polypeptide segments in a

cysteine residue might allow the second cysteine to approach closely enough for crosslinking to occur. On the other hand the third pair of cysteine residues, besides being separated by a greater distance, are located on opposite sides of a-1 and the preceding loop (Fig. 23). When the flexibility of the segment is limited, crosslinking of the third pair of cysteine residues might not occur. Removal of the FMN molecule does not make the entire flavinbinding domain equally flexible, since the two remaining cysteine residues (at positions 423 and 441) are still resistant to attack by the reagent in the ilavin-free enzyme. The bromopyruvate experiments show that, even in the holoenzyme, subtle changes in the active site modulate the reactivity of several somewhat remote cysteine side-chains toward a potent alkylating agent. The changes may be in the oxidation state of the flavin or the presence of substrates or inhibitors bound to the active site. These modulating effects are difficult to explain solely on the basis of the protein structure. Structural comparison of native and oxidized flavocytochrome 6, at 3-O A resolution showed no detectable conformational changes (Tegoni & Mathews, 1988). However, bromopyruvate may bind to the enzyme in a hydrated form, thereby propagating slightly larger conformational changes in the vicinity of the active site, as suggested by CJrban & Lederer (1988). If these changes also result in greater flexibility in this region then the sulfhydryl groups could become accessible to attack by bromopyruvate as suggested above for 2-keto-3-butynoate. (k) Flavin binding in other proteins

(i) Glycolate oxidase and trimethylamine dehydrogenase There are two other flavoenzymes of known structure containing FMN as cofactor. These are glycolate oxidase (Lindqvist & Branden, 1985) and trimethylamine dehydrogenase (Lim et al., 1986). In

reverse turn configuration. The 7a and 8a methyl groups of the benzenoid ring portion are exposed to solvent. One face of the flavin ring (the si face) is in contact with an aromatic group (tryptophan in 2 cases and tyrosine in the 3rd) and the other face is covered by a polypeptide backbone and a hydrophobic side-chain (tryptophan in 2 cases and methionine in the 3rd). Nearly all of the polar interactions of the hetero atoms of the riboflavin moiety of FMN are involved in hydrogen bonds with main-chain amido or carbonyl oxygen atoms. The exceptions are O-4* of the ribityl group, which can hydrogen bond t'o a serine or asparagine sidechain and the flavin N-3 in Clostridium MP (Smith et al., 1977), which forms a hydrogen bond with a glutamic acid side-chain, There are no positively charged side-chains within 6 L! of t'he phosphat,e group of FMN in the t,hree flavodoxin structures, even though it is quit-e buried from solvent. However, the phosphate group does form hydrogen bonds to t'wo or t'hree hydroxyl sidechains of serinr or threonine residues and to four or five peptide nibrogen atoms in sequence. The last of these amide nitrogen atoms is located at, the amino terminus of an a-helix that is point,ing away from the phosphat,e group. The positive electrical dipole produced by t,his helix (Ho1 et ccl.. 1978) might help to neutralize the negative charge of the phosphate anion. The chemical environment of the FMN molecule of flavodoxin is quite different from that of flavocyt~ochrome h,. In flavodoxin, the two methyl groups of the dimethyl benzene part of the flavin ring are exposed to solvent. In contrast, the N-5 and O-4 atoms are most exposed in flavocytochrome 6, while the methyl groups are most buried. Electron transfer from flavodoxin to acceptor proteins is thought to occur through one of these methyl groups (Simondsen et al., 1982), whereas t,he N-5 and O-4 locus is probably the area through which electrons pass in flavocytochrome h,. In flavodoxin, there are no charged side-chains in cxontact with the FMN. except for the one instance of a glutamat'e side-chain hydrogen bonding t'o K-3 in Clostridi,um MP as described above. In flavocytochrome 6, t'here is a buried lysine side-chain interacting with the N-l and O-2 locus of the flavin ring, as well as an aspartate side-chain in contact with O-3* of the ribityl moiety (see Table 8). The charge on the phosphate group of FMN in flavocytochrome h, is neutralized by two arginine side-chains as well as by a helix dipole, while in flavodoxin only the helix dipole is present.

The binding of the FMN fragment of' FAI) in glutathione reductase is considerably difierent from that in flavocytochrome h,. Tt is largely buried in the protein interior, making contact, with main- and side-chain atoms of the protein interior arid with immobilized solvent molecules. However. the pyrimidine ring of the flavin is accessible to solvent as is the benzenoid port,ion. especially t'hts 7a and 8a methyl groups. The Xa methyl group also makrxs close va,rl der Waals' contact with t,he guanidinium portion of an arginine side-chain. The N-S and O-4 atoms of the flavin ring form a hydrogen bond t,o a buried lysine side-chain. The O-3* at,om of the ribitgl group forms a hydrogen bond to an aspartate side-chain. The remammg polar atoms of the flavin ring and ribityl chain form hydrogen bonds with main-chain carbonyl and amide groups or wit,h bridging water molecules.

to a parallel &as barrel, has the re face of the flavin ring firmly planted against the polypeptide chain of the p-barrel. In this case the si face of the flavin ring is accessible to the substrate for hydrogen or electron exchange. These enzymes include flavocytochrome b,, glycolate oxidase (Lindqvist & Branden. 1985) and trimethylamine dehydrogenase (Lim et al., 1986). Studies of Manstein et al. (1988) have shown that there are two other members of this class of flavoenzyme. r,-lact,ate oxidase and u-lactate dehydrogenase. There is no clear-cut structural correlation among the re or the si active flavoenzymes. Although the basic structural motif of gluthathione reductase is reflected in several other flavoenzymes. such as p-hydroxybenzoate hydoxylase and mercuric reductase, the structure of the general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, another rf-specific flavoenzyme, is completely different from that of glutathione reductase (Kim &. Ru, 1988). On the other hand, all sispecific flavoenzgmes whose structures are known have the Psas motif and bind FMN. However, one of the si-specific enzymes. n-lactate dehydrogenase binds FAD and is likely to fold and bind the flavin differently from the FMN-containing cofactor flavoenzymes.

(1) Lactate drhydrogenase
The high-resolution structures of several forms of lactate dehydrogenase from muscle have been solved (Holbrook et al., 1975; Grau et al., 1981). The enzyme catalyzes the same reversible oxidative dehydrogenation of lactate to pyruvate as does flavocytochrome b,. However, the two enzymes have very little similarity in their structural properties or mode of catalysis. Lactate dehydrogenase is a t)etramerie enzyme of LPI, 140,000 usually isolated from the cytoplasm of vertebrate muscle. Each subunit contains t)wo domains, an N-terminal "nucleotide binding" domain consisting of a parallel six-stranded p-sheet flanked by a-helices on bot'h "catalytic" domain. The sides and a C-t#erminal cofactor is NAD rather than FMN. Furthermore, on the enzyme the NAD serves solely as the oxidizing/ reducing agent of the lactate/pyruvate substrate, unlike flavocytocahrome b,. where the FMN is reoxidized by the h-type heme. In fact, the NAD is ac%ually a substrate of lactate dehydrogenase, since it binds t)o, and dissociates from, the enzyme during the course of the reaction (Holbrook et al., 1975). The enzymes also differ in their catalyt'ic mechanism. In lactate dehydrogenase the reaction occurs ivy direct hydride transfer from lactate to the nicotinamide ring of NAD (Holbrook et al.. 1975). In flavocytochrome b, the reaction is believed t,o proceed b? way of a carbanion intermediate (l~derrr & Mathews, 1987). The geometry of t,he active sites of lactate dehydrogenase and favocytocahrome b, are also quite different. When t,he position of the lactate moiety in the lactate dehydrogenasr-NAD-pyruvate ternary cxomplrx (Whit'c, et ul., 1976) is compared with it's

b2> the position in subunit 2 of flavocytochrome nicotinamide rings is found on the side of the pyruvate molecule opposite to the flavin ring. The structure of a complex between lactate dehydrogenase and S-lac-NAD+, a substrate analogue in which L-lactate is covalently attached t)o the nicotinamide ring of NAD, has been determined (Grau et al., 1981). In this complex, the carboxylate of the lactate fragment forms hydrogen bonds to an arginine side-chain so that the pair of carboxylate oxygen atoms face the pair of terminal guanidinium nitrogen atoms. This situation is in contrast to flavocytochrome b,, where one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of pyruvate forms a hydrogen bond to the NE of an arginine side-chain and the other forms a hydrogen bond to a tyrosine hydroxyl group. There is a histidine side-chain in the active site of lactate dehydrogenase that forms a hydrogen bond through its NE atom to the hydroxyl oxygen atom attached to C-2 of lactate in the S-lac-NAD+ complex with lactate dehydrogenase. This histidine residue is thought) to be essential for catalysis and to play a key role in the catalytic mechanism (Holbrook et al.. 1975). On the other side of the histidine residue there is an aspartate side-chain that, forms a hydrogen bond with the ND atom of histidine. This arrangement of Asp-His-O is reminiscent, of the "charge relay system" of the serinr proteases (Birkt)oft, & Banaszak, 1983) and has been shown to be important for both cat,alysis and substrate binding (Clarke et al., 1988). There is also an arginine side-chain present in the active site of lactate dehydrogenase that interacts with the substrate hydroxyl oxygen atom (Grau et nl., 1981). This basic residue serves to enhance the polarizat,ion of the oxygen atom during catalysis (Plarkc et al., 1986). In flavocytochrome b, there is also an aspartatehistidine pair of side-chains oriented so that the histidine nitrogen atom opposite the aspartate can interact with the pyruvate carbonyl group (Fig. 17). Howrver; instead of an arginine side-chain forming a second interaction with the carbonyl oxygen, there is a tyrosine side-chain in the analogous position (Fig. 17). Thus the only similarity between the active site of lactate dehydrogenase and flavob, is the relative positions of histidine, cytochrome asparate and substrate. Otherwise bhe cnomposition of t,he active site and the disposition of side-chains therein is quite different in the two e'nzymes.

4. Conclusion
The structure of flavocytochrome 0, has a number of interesting and unusual features. The l-fold symmet'ry of the tetramer is unusual. having been observed in only one other protein. t'he influenza virus neuraminidase (Varghese et al.. 1983). Another unusual feature is the marked asymmetry of the two independent subunits. In one case, the relative order of the cptochrome domain allows a great deal of detailed information about t'he interaction of the

intramolecular electron transfer partners to be obtained. In the other case the details of the binding mode of the reaction product, itself a substrate for the reverse reaction, are provided. It is not yet known whether the order/disorder of the cytochrome domain is functionally important or merely an artifact of the crystal packing. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies (Labeyrie et al., 1988) of line broadening of the heme resonances indicate that the cytochrome domains are mobile in solution, but the degree of mobility is unknown. Tyr143 plays an interesting and possibly key role at the active site. In subunit 1 it interacts with a heme propionate, while in subunit 2 it interacts with the pyruvate. It might act as a switch between two stages of the enzyme, preventing ordered cytochrome binding and electron transfer when substrate or product are present. Alternatively, it might prevent substrate binding from occurring during the electron transfer process. The understanding of these and other aspects of the catalytic function of the enzyme may soon be possible by careful design of mutant enzymes using site-directed (Reid et al., 1988). mutagenesis We thank S.
