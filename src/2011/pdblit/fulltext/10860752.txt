Structure of the Replicating Complex of a Pol Family DNA Polymerase
Matthew C. Franklin,1 Jimin Wang,1 and Thomas A. Steitz1,2,3,4 1 Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry 2 Department of Chemistry 3 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Yale University New Haven, Connecticut 06511 DNA polymerases, with the exception of DNA polymerase (pol ), have a common structural core, containing the two universally conserved aspartate residues (Delarue et al., 1990) which, together with the dNTP, bind the two divalent metal ions that catalyze the polymerase reaction (Brautigam and Steitz, 1998; Steitz, 1993). Two structures of the DNA polymerase from the bacteriophage RB69 (RB69 pol) have been described previously: one of the apo enzyme (Wang et al., 1997), and one of an editing complex (Shamoo and Steitz, 1999). Comparison of these structures with those of thermophilic pol family polymerases (Hopfner et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 1999) shows a high degree of structural equivalence, suggesting that RB69 pol is a good structural model for other pol family polymerases despite a low sequence similarity with them (RB69 pol is 18% identical to the thermophilic pol family polymerases, and about 15% identical to human pol ). RB69 pol is also closely related to T4 DNA polymerase (T4 pol, reviewed in Karam and Konigsberg, 2000). An interesting architectural difference between pol I and pol family polymerases is that the domain containing the site of the editing exonuclease lies on one side of the palm in the pol I family, and on the opposite side in the pol family, suggesting differences in the mechanism by which the primer terminus is transferred from the polymerase to the exonuclease active site (Wang et al., 1997). A structural model of the process of DNA polymerization has been generated by comparison of various binary (polymerase and DNA) and ternary (polymerase, primertemplate DNA duplex, and dNTP at the polymerase active site) complexes (Doublie et al., 1999; Li et al., 1998; ´ Pelletier et al., 1994). The initial step of DNA synthesis involves binding of a primer-template duplex DNA to the apo-polymerase, which causes the thumb to close down around the DNA. A dNTP then binds to this binary complex, inducing a conformational change in the fingers, which rotate toward the polymerase active site, moving from the open conformation adopted in the absence of dNTP to a closed, catalytically competent conformation. This fingers movement, which has been seen in the pol I, pol , and RT families (Doublie et al., 1998; ´ Huang et al., 1998; Pelletier et al., 1994), is thought to represent the slow, rate-limiting step prior to catalysis which had been detected previously in kinetic studies (Frey et al., 1995; Kuchta et al., 1987). Transfer of the dNTP onto the 3 end of the primer strand ensues, followed by release of pyrophosphate and translocation of the DNA to begin the cycle again. The multistep process of polymerization provides the polymerase with several different points at which to discriminate between correct and incorrect nucleotides (Capson et al., 1992; Frey et al., 1995; Johnson, 1993). (The following numbers were obtained for T7 DNA polymerase, a pol I family member, and are not necessarily applicable to the pol family.) Binding of the dNTP to form a productive polymerizing complex favors the correct nucleotide by a factor of 102­103 (Patel et al., 1991). The subsequent rate-limiting step (possibly the

Summary ° We describe the 2.6 A resolution crystal structure of RB69 DNA polymerase with primer-template DNA and dTTP, capturing the step just before primer extension. This ternary complex structure in the human DNA polymerase family shows a 60 rotation of the fingers domain relative to the apo-protein structure, similar to the fingers movement in pol I family polymerases. Minor groove interactions near the primer 3 terminus suggest a common fidelity mechanism for pol I and pol family polymerases. The duplex product DNA orientation differs by 40 between the polymerizing mode and editing mode structures. The role of the thumb in this DNA motion provides a model for editing in the pol family. Introduction DNA polymerases are the central element in the transmission and maintenance of genetic information. While part of the active site of these critically important enzymes has been highly conserved throughout evolution, it is perhaps surprising that the portion which is conserved is so minimal. The divergence of the sequence motifs comprising the polymerase active site makes it possible to divide these enzymes into several families (Braithwaite and Ito, 1993). The two largest and beststudied of these families are the one containing E. coli DNA polymerase I (the pol I family, also known as Family A) and the one containing human DNA polymerase (the pol family, or Family B). The sequence motifs that are well conserved within a family are only weakly conserved between families; nevertheless, it is possible to align two equivalent motifs (named A and C) in many DNA and RNA polymerase families (Delarue et al., 1990). Molecular structures of a number of DNA polymerases are now available (see Brautigam and Steitz, 1998 for a review of older structures) including, recently, three thermophilic pol family polymerases (Hopfner et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 1999). All of these structures share a common architecture: their polymerase portions can be likened to a right hand, with palm, fingers, and thumb domains, as was first suggested for Klenow fragment (Ollis et al., 1985). While the fingers and thumb domains differ both in sequence and structure between families, the palm domains of all

fingers closing) is inhibited by an incorrect nucleotide, drastically slowing the polymerase reaction in this case; this has the effect of raising the fidelity at the polymerization step to 104­105 (Wong et al., 1991). If the polymerase adds an incorrect nucleotide to the primer strand, subsequent polymerization is slowed greatly, giving the polymerase's 3  5 editing exonuclease activity more opportunity to remove the misincorporated base (Donlin et al., 1991). This exonucleolytic proofreading raises the net polymerase fidelity even further; T4 DNA polymerase can reach fidelities of nearly 108 (Drake, 1991). ° We have determined the 2.6 A resolution crystal structure of RB69 DNA polymerase complexed with primertemplate DNA and an incoming deoxynucleoside triphosphate. The structure captures the step just prior to the catalytic transfer of the dNTP onto the 3 terminus of the primer strand; this pol family ternary complex shows both similarities to and differences from the ternary complexes of other polymerase families. The fingers domain of this polymerase has rotated into a closed conformation as seen in other DNA polymerase ternary complexes and functions in a manner analogous to other fingers domains despite the lack of structural similarity among them. Comparison of this structure with the previously determined structure of RB69 pol in its editing mode (Shamoo and Steitz, 1999) shows striking differences in the orientations of the DNA in these complexes and provides insights into the mechanism of polymerase editing. Results Structure Determination The ternary complex was crystallized using a mutant polymerase in which two of the catalytic aspartates (residues 222 and 327) at the exonuclease active site have been replaced with alanine (Dressman et al., 1997), thereby reducing the exonuclease activity by at least 106 fold (data not shown). The complex also contains dTTP, a template oligonucleotide paired with a dideoxyterminated primer (Figure 1B), and Ca2 . The structure of the ternary complex was solved by molecular replacement using the computer program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994), with the RB69 pol editing-mode structure (Shamoo and Steitz, 1999) stripped of all nonprotein atoms as the search model. The structure was improved by cycles of model building using the program O (Jones et al., 1991), followed by refinement using the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). In the course of work on the ternary complex, we also took advantage of an improved cryoprotection technique (see Experimental Procedures) to extend the resolution of the RB69 apo polymerase structure from 2.8 ° to 2.2 A (Table 1). This higher resolution apo structure proved useful in the refinement of the ternary complex model, as the local geometry of the protein was generally the same in both structures except in areas that contacted the DNA. By using the structure of the apo enzyme as a guide for model building of the ternary complex, we were able to obtain a model of better quality ° than would have been possible by using only the 2.6 A resolution data from the ternary complex. The current ternary complex model (Figure 1A) contains all the residues of the protein except the last two, all the bases of

the DNA, the dTTP molecule and four calcium ions; it has an R factor of 19.8%, and a free R (Brunger, 1992) ° of 25.7% against all data from 30 to 2.6 A (Table 1). Figure 1C shows electron density from a compositeomit map around the nascent base pair of the ternary complex. Interactions between the Polymerase and the Incoming Nucleotide The incoming dTTP is bound in the active site of the polymerase in a manner analogous to that seen in the structures of other ternary complexes (Doublie et al., ´ 1998; Huang et al., 1998; Li et al., 1998; Pelletier et al., 1994). The most highly conserved sequence motifs in the pol family are DxxSLYPS and YGDTDS, corresponding to Motifs A and C (respectively) of Delarue et al. (1990). These motifs form a three-stranded antiparallel sheet containing two absolutely conserved aspartate residues: Asp 411 (in Motif A) and Asp 623 (the second aspartate in Motif C) which, together with the triphosphate tail of the dTTP, coordinate two divalent metal ions (Figure 2A). The triphosphate tail also contacts three positively charged residues in the two most conserved motifs of the fingers domain: Arg 482 and Lys 486 interact with the phosphate, while Lys 560 makes a hydrogen bond to the bridging oxygen between the and phosphates. The ribose of the dTTP stacks on top of the phenyl ring of Tyr 416 (in motif A) in a manner similar to that seen with Tyr 115 in the ternary complex structure of HIV-1 RT (Huang et al., 1998). Steric clash between Tyr 416 and the 2 OH of ribonucleotides selects for dNTPs, an effect confirmed by mutagenesis in other pol family polymerases (Bonnin et al., 1999; Gardner and Jack, 1999); a similar "steric gating" effect is produced by a glutamate in the pol I family (Astatke et al., 1998; Doublie et al., 1998; Li et al., 1998) and was ´ first suggested for the equivalent tyrosine in HIV-1 RT (Gao et al., 1997). The ribose of the dTTP in this structure adopts a C3 -endo conformation, placing the 3 OH where it can make hydrogen bonds to the main chain amide of Tyr 416, and to a nonbridging oxygen of the nucleotide's phosphate. This interaction is also seen in the HIV-1 RT ternary complex structure (Huang et al., 1998) and implied by the dideoxynucleotide-containing ´ pol I family ternary complex structures (Doublie et al., 1998; Li et al., 1998). Interactions between the Polymerase and the Primer-Template DNA The primer-template DNA duplex binds in a groove formed between the thumb and palm domains, making contacts with the protein over one full turn of the DNA helix. As seen in other ternary complex structures (Doublie et al., 1998; Huang et al., 1998; Li et al., 1998; ´ Pelletier et al., 1994), the single-stranded 5 extension of the template DNA is sharply kinked at the polymerase active site, so that the template base which pairs with ° the incoming nucleotide is more than 11 A away from its 5 neighbor. In the known pol I family ternary complex structures, the path of the 5 single-stranded extension of the template DNA is unclear, as interpretable electron density exists only for the base immediately adjacent to the polymerase active site (Doublie et al., 1998; Li ´ et al., 1998). The template oligonucleotide used in this

Figure 1. Overview of the Polymerase-DNA-dNTP Ternary Complex (A) The RB69 DNA polymerase, shown in a ribbon representation, is colored as follows: the N-terminal domain (residues 1­108 and 340­382) is in yellow, exonuclease domain (residues 109­339) in red, palm (residues 383­468 and 573­729) in magenta, fingers (residues 469­572) in blue, and thumb (residues 730­903) in green. The naming convention for secondary structure elements of this protein can be found in Wang et al. (1997). The primer and template strands of the DNA are shown in a stick representation, with the primer in gold and the template in gray. The incoming dTTP is shown colored according to atom type, with carbons in gold. The two calcium ions bound at the polymerase active site are shown as light blue spheres, along with a calcium at the exonuclease active site. The first two bases of the template strand show the path of the single-stranded template as it enters the polymerase active site; a probable extension of this path is shown as a gray dotted line. (B) In this schematic of protein-DNA contacts, the primer-template DNA is represented as a ladder, with the bases represented as rectangles, and the phosphates as circles. Direct hydrogen-bond contacts between protein and DNA are indicated by solid lines between the amino acid name and a circle (for phosphate contacts) or a rectangle (for contacts with a hydrogen-bond acceptor in the minor groove). Interactions with main-chain amides are denoted by replacing the residue name with "N," e.g., "362 N." Water-mediated hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines, while charge-charge interactions are indicated by placing the residue name, in parentheses, next to the phosphate with which it interacts. Trp 574 makes a ring-stacking interaction with the 5 terminal template A. Not all of the interactions between the dTTP and the protein are shown here; see the text and Figure 2A. DNA residues interacting with the symmetry-related molecule are not shown; see the Experimental Procedures for the complete primer and template sequences. (C) A A-weighted composite-omit electron density map, contoured at 1.0 sigma, is shown as a blue mesh. The base pair between the incoming dTTP and the template A is shown in stick form, as are the surrounding protein side chains. The orientation of this figure is the same as that of Figure 3B.

structure has only 2 unpaired bases at the 5 end, but both of these are sufficiently well-ordered to be visible in electron density maps. The base of the 5 -terminal A stacks against the nonconserved Trp 574 of the palm domain. The probable extension of this 2 base ssDNA lies in a groove between the exonuclease and N-terminal domains (Figure 1A); this groove has a net positive charge, primarily from the conserved residues Lys 247, Arg 249, and Lys 251, which point into the channel from the exonuclease-domain side. The primer-template duplex DNA in this structure maintains a B-form conformation throughout: the primer and template strand riboses are C2 -endo, and the minor ° groove width is 7.2 A at the 3 end of the primer strand.

This is in contrast to the A-form DNA observed near the active site of pol I family polymerases, with C3 -endo ° riboses and a wide, shallow minor groove (9.8 to 10.5 A wide: Doublie et al., 1998; Eom et al., 1996; Kiefer et al., ´ 1998; Li et al., 1998). A similar B-form DNA has been seen in the pol ternary complex structures (Pelletier et al., 1994; Sawaya et al., 1997), but RB69 pol is a replicative polymerase with this particular DNA conformation. The B-form DNA here is stabilized by a conserved KKRY sequence motif (residues 705­708 in RB69 pol) that is unique to the pol family (Braithwaite and Ito, 1993). Tyr 708 from this motif makes a hydrogen bond to the phosphodiester at the primer 3 terminus, while Lys 705 and Arg 707 interact with template strand

phosphates (Figure 2B), thereby drawing the primer and template strand backbones together. The polymerase makes contacts primarily with the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA (Figure 1B); most of the residues involved in these interactions are not conserved in the pol family, suggesting that these interactions are important in aggregate, not individually. Interactions with the primer strand phosphates are largely direct hydrogen bonds to protein main or side chains, while the template strand is in addition bound by a number of charge-charge interactions. The extended coil region that stretches between helix K of the N-terminal domain and strand 14 of the palm (residues 377­395) contacts the template strand near the polymerase active site (Figure 1). The residues in this region are highly conserved in the pol family; those that most closely approach the DNA are conserved as small side chains (residue 393 is a glycine, while 394 can be either Gly or Ala; Braithwaite and Ito, 1993). A single overhanging G at the 3 end of the template strand is bound by the N-terminal domain of a symmetryrelated molecule in the crystal lattice (Figure 1A). This interaction is specific for G, with the O6, N1, and N2 of the base making hydrogen bonds with protein backbone groups. An isolated G nucleotide is bound in the same manner in the apo RB69 pol structure (Wang et al., 1997, as well as the higher-resolution version presented here) and in the RB69 pol editing complex (Shamoo and Steitz, 1999). The N-terminal domain of RB69 pol is not known to play any role in polymerase or exonuclease function; however, some mutants in this region (of T4 pol) affect expression levels of the polymerase (Hughes et al., 1987). T4 and RB69 polymerases repress their own translation by binding to a stem-loop structure in their mRNA upstream of the translation start site (Pavlov and

Karam, 2000; Tuerk et al., 1990); however, there is no unpaired G in this stem-loop, rendering the significance of our structural observation unclear. Conformational Changes Produced by Substrate Binding The fingers domain of the RB69 pol ternary complex structure is in a "closed" conformation similar to that observed in the ternary complexes of other polymerases. Comparison of the RB69 pol apo and ternary complex structures shows that the fingers domain has rotated toward the palm by 60 upon formation of the ° ternary complex, moving the fingers tip by 30 A. This rotation carries the conserved residues Arg 482, Lys ° 486, and Lys 560 four to eight A closer to the active site, where they interact with the triphosphate group of the incoming dNTP as described above. The fingers domain, in its closed conformation, also interacts with the exonuclease domain, in particular with the end of helix H, which extends into the exonuclease active site, providing a structural linkage between the two active sites of this enzyme. The thermophilic pol family apo-polymerase structures all have fingers that are more open than the conformation seen here (Hopfner et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 1999). There is also no evidence in this structure of the corotation of the fingers and exonuclease domains suggested for the 9 N-7 polymerase (Rodriguez et al., 2000). The conformation of the thumb in this structure is overall more closed than in the unliganded form. The thumb as a whole has rotated down toward the palm by about 8 degrees, wrapping around the primer-template DNA duplex on its minor groove side. Residues 784­790, part of a loop in the thumb tip, make a number of contacts with the primer strand backbone and minor groove

Figure 2. The Polymerase Active Site (A) The backbones of the polymerase palm and fingers domains are shown as magenta and blue ribbons. The carbon atoms of the polymerase side chains shown in stick form are white, while those of the DNA template are dark gray, and those of the primer DNA and dTTP are gold. The bound calcium atoms are shown as light blue mesh spheres, labeled A and B according to their catalytic function. Hydrogen bonds are shown as green lines, while interactions with the metal ions are blue lines. This view looks down the length of the fingers, roughly 180 away from the orientation of Figure 1A. (B) The KKRY motif (residues 705­708) interacts with the primertemplate duplex next to the polymerase active site. Residues 703­ 708 are shown; Thr 703 and Gly 704 are not conserved in the pol family. Asp 621 from Figure 2A is shown as an isolated side chain. Only the last two bases of the primer strand are shown for clarity. The orientation of this figure can be related to that of Figure 2A by comparing the primer-template DNA.

of the DNA. This loop is substantially shorter in the thermophilic pol structures, but the position of the portion which would interact with the DNA is largely the same. Discussion The Catalytic Cycle of a Pol Family Polymerase The binding of a correctly basepaired incoming dNTP to a binary complex of polymerase and primer-template DNA induces a rotation of the fingers domain that is

essential for catalysis, as has been observed in three other DNA polymerase families (Doublie et al., 1998; ´ Huang et al., 1998; Li et al., 1998; Pelletier et al., 1994). In the binary RB69 pol-DNA complex, the fingers domain will probably be in the open conformation seen in the apo RB69 pol structure and also in binary complexes of DNA with pol I family polymerases (Eom et al., 1996; Kiefer et al., 1998; Li et al., 1998) and HIV-1 RT (JacoboMolina et al., 1993). The incoming dNTP is likely to bind to the open fingers domain in a manner similar to that observed for Klenow fragment (Beese et al., 1993b) and the equivalent fragment of T. aquaticus DNA polymerase I (Klentaq; Li et al., 1998); in the case of RB69 pol, the binding would be mediated in part by the same interactions between Arg 482, Lys 486, Lys 560, and the dNTP which are seen in the closed ternary complex (Figure 2A). Previous mutagenesis in T4 pol has shown that all of these residues are important for binding of the nucleotide (Yang et al., 1999). Nucleotide binding would be followed by a conformational change in which the fingers rotated to the closed state seen in the ternary complex structure, thereby delivering the dNTP to the polymerase active site (Figure 3A). Catalysis of the phosphoryl transfer step that adds the dNTP to the primer strand depends on the correct relative positions of the fingers residues Arg 482, Lys 486, and Lys 560; the three phosphates of the dNTP; the primer-terminal 3 OH; and the two catalytic metal ions. This optimal positioning of substrates and catalytic residues only occurs in the closed ternary complex (Figure 2A). The fingers residues Arg 482 and Lys 486 interact with the phosphate of the dNTP and, along with metal ion B, help neutralize the negative charge on the pyrophosphate product of catalysis. Lys 560 is in position to hydrogen-bond to one of the two negatively charged equatorial oxygens of the phosphate in the pentacovalent transition state; the other equatorial oxygen interacts with the two metal ions. This Lys 560 interaction may enhance catalysis by helping the metal ions to stabilize the pentacovalent geometry, and/or by neutralizing the additional negative charge that develops on the equatorial oxygens of the transition state. Mutation of Lys 560, Arg 482, or Lys 486 affects both the binding of the dNTP and the rate of polymerization (Yang et al., 1999); mechanistic interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that the phosphoryl transfer step is not rate-limiting for a correct nucleotide (Capson et al., 1992; Frey et al., 1995). However, recent presteady-state data show that mutation of Lys 560 to Ala reduces the rate of polymerization by over 250-fold (G. Yang and W. Konigsberg, personal communication). The formation of a closed, catalytically competent ternary complex requires that the nascent base pair fit into a pocket on the fingers domain (Figure 3B). The discrimination against incorrect nucleotides here appears to depend on the shape of a correct Watson-Crick base pair (Kool, 1998), as there are no electrostatic or hydrogen-bonding interactions with the bases of the nascent base pair in this structure. The binding pocket of RB69 pol, like that of other DNA and RNA polymerases, has a clear delineation of the minor groove side of the nascent base pair. Superposition of an A-form A:C mispair (taken from PDB code 402D; Jang et al., 1998) on the correct A:T pair shows that the highly con-

Figure 4. A Tunnel into the Polymerase Active Site The molecular surface of RB69 pol in its polymerizing mode is colored by domain according to the scheme of Figure 1A. The dTTP and associated metal ions are at the center of the image, with the primer-template DNA, shown semitransparently behind the surface, extending off to the left. The terminal amine of Lys 560 protrudes into the tunnel, as indicated. This view is roughly the same as that of Figures 2A and 3A.

Figure 3. Recognition of the Nascent Base Pair (A) Helices N and P of the fingers domain are shown as thin ribbons, with the side chains of residues 482, 486, and 560 in stick form. The ribbons and residues of the apo RB69 pol structure are colored gray, while those of the RB69 ternary complex are blue; the two structures were superimposed on their palm domains. The incoming dTTP and 3 terminal base of the primer strand in the ternary complex are shown in stick form colored gold, while the template strand bases pairing with them are colored dark gray. The ribbon for helix P is not drawn for residues 536­550 for reasons of clarity. This view is essentially that of Figure 2A. (B) The fingers and palm residues which make up the nascent base pair binding pocket are shown in space-filling form, as are the dTTP and the template A that pairs with it. The dTTP is colored gold, the template A dark gray, and the protein atoms are colored according to atom type. Superimposed onto the actual base pair is the structure of an A-form A:C mismatch (shown as magenta sticks), taken from PDB code 402D (Jang et al., 1998). This view is along the axis of the primer-template DNA, which is not shown.

such as G:A (Pan et al., 1999), or else the pol family can achieve sufficient incorporation fidelity by checking only the minor groove side of the nascent base pair. Release of the pyrophosphate following catalysis may be accomplished differently by the pol I and pol families. In pol I polymerase ternary complexes, the dNTP is almost completely buried, with only a small slot less ° than 2 A wide connecting the gamma phosphate to the outside of the protein (Doublie et al., 1998; Li et al., ´ 1998). The pyrophosphate may be unable to diffuse through this tunnel, instead having to wait for the fingers to open before exiting the active site. Supporting this idea, kinetic evidence suggests that a slow transition step must occur between catalysis and pyrophosphate release in pol I polymerases (Dahlberg and Benkovic, 1991; Patel et al., 1991). In the RB69 pol structure, by contrast, the tunnel connecting the active site to bulk solvent is more than large enough to allow the pyrophosphate to leave the active site without having to wait for the fingers to open (Figure 4). Supporting this model, kinetic evidence shows that there is no slow step between phosphoryl transfer and pyrophosphate release in T4 pol (Capson et al., 1992). A Common Mismatch Sensing Mechanism in Many Polymerases Both pol I and pol polymerases may use interactions with the minor groove of the newly formed product DNA as a means of checking for misincorporated nucleotides. In RB69 pol, Lys 706, part of the highly conserved KKRY motif mentioned above, makes two hydrogen bonds: on one side, to Asp 621 (part of motif C), and on the other, to an acceptor on the minor groove side of the penultimate primer-template base pair (Figure 5A). This acceptor will be present, and in roughly the same position, regardless of the DNA sequence as long as the base pair has proper Watson-Crick geometry (Seeman et al., 1976). Tyr 567, one of the most highly conserved fingers residues,

served Tyr 567, in particular, would sterically clash with the minor groove side (Figure 3B); mutation of this tyrosine to a smaller residue makes the polymerase more permissive for misincorporation (Saturno et al., 1995; Yang et al., 1999). In contrast, the major groove side of the binding pocket is very poorly defined (as is the case in other polymerases): Leu 561 forms the only protrusion which could interfere with a bulge on the major groove side of a mispair, and the steric overlap would be very ° slight, on the order of 0.1­0.2 A. Nevertheless, this residue is at least as large as a valine in every pol family polymerase sequenced so far, except Epstein-Barr virus DNA polymerase (Bankier et al., 1983). Either this slight steric overlap is sufficient to provide discrimination against mispairs which protrude into the major groove,

The RB69 clamp structure (PDB code 1B77; Shamoo and Steitz, 1999) was docked onto the DNA and rotated so that residue 36 was near the C-terminal tail of the polymerase. The molecular surface of this docked clamp is shown as a black outline. The equivalent docked clamp for the editing-mode complex is shown as a red outline. The editing-mode docking model is from PDB code 1QE4 (Shamoo and Steitz, 1999), and was superimposed on the polymerizing-mode structure using the carbons of the palm domain. (B) The RB69 pol editing-mode complex (PDB code 1CLQ; Shamoo and Steitz, 1999) is shown in the same orientation as Figure 6A. The polymerizing-mode DNA helix axis is superimposed for comparison.

makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the equivalent acceptor on the template strand of the last primertemplate base pair. In the event of a mispair, one or both of the minor groove hydrogen-bond acceptors will be moved out of position (Hunter et al., 1987a, 1987b), breaking the interaction between the DNA and the protein. As a consequence, the DNA will be less tightly bound in the polymerase active site, decreasing the chances of further polymerization past the mispair, and increasing the chances of the DNA moving to the exonuclease site to have the incorrect base removed. All three of the amino acids involved in these minor-groove interactions are highly conserved in the pol family, and mutations of any of these residues produce proteins with weak polymerase activity, probably due to the disruption of this DNA binding (Blasco et al., 1995; Copeland and Wang, 1993; Saturno et al., 1998). In the pol I family, an arginine (T7 pol residue 429, Klentaq residue 573, equivalent to pol I residue 668) makes a minor-groove interaction similar to those described for RB69 pol (Figure 5B). This arginine is buttressed by a histidine in the polymerase active site (T7 residue 653), which itself makes a water-mediated inter-

action with an invariant hydrogen-bond acceptor in the minor groove (Doublie et al., 1998; Li et al., 1998). The ´ R668A mutant of Klenow fragment has a higher error rate than wild-type, especially for transition mutations (Minnick et al., 1999). Both polymerase families interact with the minor groove side of the last two primer-template base pairs; however, the most direct interaction in RB69 pol is with the penultimate base pair, rather than with the final base pair as in the pol I family.

Figure 7. The T4 A737V Antimutator Mutant (A) The thumb domain of the editing-mode complex is drawn as a green ribbon. The primer-template DNA present in this structure is indicated by two ribbons, gold for the primer strand backbone and gray for the template strand. Ala 740 is drawn in stick form, while " V" indicates -helix V in the thumb tip, which forms the majority of the pocket into which Ala 740 packs. (B) The thumb domain of the polymerizingmode complex is represented in the same manner as in Figure 7A. The relative orientation of the polymerizing- and editing-mode thumbs shown here was fixed by superimposing the palm domains of the two structures. (C) A molecular-surface representation of the polymerizing-mode thumb is shown superimposed on a ribbon representation of helices T and U in the thumb base, and helix V in the thumb tip. The light green surface was calculated for the thumb-tip residues (774­866) only, while the dark green surface is of the thumb base residues (730­773 and 867­903). Ala 740 is again shown in stick form. The orientation of this figure is roughly 180 away from Figures 7a and 7b.

1999) permits an understanding of the structural changes involved in switching between the two modes. Most ° significantly, the primer terminus of the DNA travels 40 A in going from the polymerase to the exonuclease active sites; this motion is accompanied by a 40 rotation in the helix axis of the dsDNA (Figure 6). The rotation of the DNA is required in order to enter the editing mode: residues 273­288 in the exonuclease domain form a structure which will otherwise confine the primer terminus to the polymerase active site. Modeling of the gp45 sliding clamp (Shamoo and Steitz, 1999) onto a straight extension of the DNA actually present in the polymerizing- and editing-mode structures suggests that as the DNA reorients, the clamp must move a large distance relative to the polymerase (Figure 6). This may explain why the clamp is attached to the polymerase's C-terminal tail (Berdis et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997), which forms a flexible tether, rather than a fixed contact between two surfaces. The two subdomains of the thumb move in very different manners in switching from polymerizing to editing modes (Figure 7). While the helices at the base of the thumb rotate by only 7 degrees relative to the palm, the thumb tip rotates 16 degrees away from the palm, and twists 20 degrees away from the exo domain. The DNA remains attached to the thumb tip in this reorientation, with residues 784­790 maintaining contacts to the phosphates of the primer strand. These are, in fact, the only interactions between the polymerase and the DNA that remain constant between the two modes. With the DNA thus held firmly by the thumb tip, and with the thumb base remaining largely fixed relative to the rest of the polymerase, motion of the DNA comes largely from flexing of the hinge region between thumb tip and thumb base (Figure 7). While the transfer of the DNA between polymerizing and editing active sites is probably a passive diffusion, the thumb domain could guide the DNA on a path between the two sites, constraining the diffusion to one dimension and consequently speeding up the transition between editing and polymerizing modes. The consequences of interfering with this DNA motion can be seen in a mutation of alanine 737 to valine in the homologous T4 DNA polymerase, which produces an antimutator phenotype (Epstein et al., 1963; Reha-

Krantz, 1989). The corresponding residue in RB69 DNA polymerase, Ala 740, is at the interface between the thumb base and the thumb tip (Figure 7). With the thumb tip in its "down," polymerizing-mode, position, this residue packs against hydrophobic residues of helix V in the thumb tip (Figure 7C). The larger valine cannot fit into this pocket, which would prevent the thumb tip from swinging down properly. With the thumb tip mispositioned, the primer-template DNA will not be correctly oriented at the polymerase active site, thereby impeding polymerization. The packing between the base and tip of the thumb is looser in editing mode, so an Ala  Val mutation will not affect exonuclease activity as much as it affects polymerase activity, altering the balance between these two functions and generating the antimutator effect (Stocki et al., 1995; Wu et al., 1998). Suppressor mutants of A737V, such as L771F, L771H, and L771 V (Stocki et al., 1995) would reshape the hydrophobic pocket into which the alanine would bind, at least partially restoring the correct packing between thumb tip and base in the "down" position. Comparison of polymerizing- and editing-mode structures of pol I family polymerases (Beese et al., 1993a; Doublie et al., 1998; Eom et al., 1996; Li et al., 1998) ´ shows that the principles governing the transition in the pol family also apply in the pol I family. The thumb domain of pol I polymerases can be divided into base and tip subdomains (helices H and I, and the intervening residues, respectively); while the thumb base is in roughly the same orientation in polymerizing and editing modes, the thumb tip, along with the DNA, rotates by about 25 . The direction of the rotation differs between the pol I and pol families due to the different location of the exonuclease domain (Wang et al., 1997), but in both cases, the contacts between the thumb tip and DNA backbone are the only interactions that are preserved in both polymerizing and editing modes. In the pol I family, but not the pol family, the DNA must also helically translocate by three bases in order to unwind enough of the primer strand to reach the exonuclease active site (Beese et al., 1993a; Doublie et al., 1998; Eom ´ et al., 1996; Li et al., 1998). During this movement, the thumb tip acts as a "guide rail" along which the DNA backbone can slide. This is probably also the function

RB69 DNA Polymerase Ternary Complex Structure 665

of the thumb tip, in both pol I and pol families, during the translocation following primer extension which resets the polymerase for the next round of catalysis. The polymerizing-mode complex of RB69 DNA polymerase provides a structural framework for understanding the process of DNA synthesis in all members of the pol polymerase family. A comparison with the RB69 pol editing-mode structure shows how this polymerase switches from polymerizing to editing modes; the principles governing this switch are also applicable to polymerases of the pol I family. The network of hydrogen bonds seen in this structure which secure the primer terminus in the polymerase active site and detect misincorporated nucleotides have equivalents in the pol I family, suggesting a common fidelity checking mechanism. Other aspects of fidelity still need to be addressed structurally; in particular, ternary complex structures containing an incorrect incoming dNTP, or a mismatched primer terminus, remain to be determined.
Experimental Procedures Materials Deoxythymidine triphosphate (100 mM solution) was purchased from Pharmacia. The primer and template oligonucleotides were synthesized by the W.M. Keck Biotechnology Facility at Yale. The template oligo sequence is: 5 -ACAGGTAAGCAGTCCGCG-3 and the primer oligo sequence is: 5 -GCGGACTGCTTACddC-3 . The primer oligo was synthesized with the dideoxy-C at the 3 terminus, rather than requiring the polymerase to add the dideoxynucleotide in the crystallization drop, as other groups have done (Doublie et ´ al., 1998; Li et al., 1998; Pelletier et al., 1994). DE52 and P11 chromatography resins were purchased from Baker. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fluka. Expression and Purification of RB69 DNA Polymerase The overexpression plasmids for wild-type and exonuclease-deficient mutant (D222A/D327A) RB69 DNA polymerase are gifts from J.D. Karam, and have been described previously (Dressman et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1995). BL21(DE3) E. coli containing one of the plasmids were grown in 2 YT at 37 C; overexpression of the polymerase was induced when the culture OD600 reached 1.5 by the addition of IPTG (Diagnostic Chemicals, Ltd.) to 0.5 mM, followed by overnight growth at 20 C. The wild-type RB69 pol purification is derived from a previously published protocol for T4 pol (Lin et al., 1994). Frozen cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The lysis supernatant was passed through a 0.45 micron filter, then loaded onto a DE52-cellulose column connected in series with a P11 phosphocellulose column. After extensive washing, the DE52 column was removed, and the RB69 pol was eluted from the P11 column with a 50­500 mM NaCl gradient at pH 8.0. Polymerase-containing fractions were pooled and adjusted to pH 7.0. The pool was then loaded, without further dilution or dialysis, onto a Mono-S column (Pharmacia), and eluted with a 0­0.5 M NaCl gradient at pH 7.0. The purest polymerasecontaining fractions (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, exchanged into a storage buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8]; 10 mM KCl; 3 mM DTT; 0.1 mM EDTA; and 5% glycerol), concentrated to 10­20 mg/ml, and stored at 80 C. The initial steps of the exonuclease-deficient RB69 pol purification parallelled those of the wild-type pol purification, except that care was taken to minimize contamination of the prep with other proteins, especially wild-type RB69 pol. Columns were made with new resin where feasible, or else thoroughly cleaned. In addition to the steps described above, the pooled fractions from the Mono-S column were concentrated and passed over a Superdex-75 prep grade 26/ 600 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with a buffer containing 2 M NaCl. The peak fractions from the Superdex-75 column were pooled, concentrated, and passed over a Superdex-200 column equilibrated

in the same high-salt buffer. Fractions from the Superdex-200 column were assayed for nuclease activity (Cowart et al., 1989); nuclease-free fractions were buffer-exchanged, concentrated, and frozen like wild-type RB69 pol. Crystallizations Orthorhombic crystals of apo RB69 pol were grown as previously described (Wang et al., 1997). To produce crystals of the ternary complex, freshly thawed exonuclease-deficient polymerase (10­20 mg/ml) was mixed in an equimolar ratio with annealed primer-template duplex; dTTP was then added to 1 mM concentration. An equal volume of well solution (200 mM CaCl2, 30% (w/v) PEG 350 monomethyl ether, and 100 mM sodium cacodylate [pH 6.25]) was added to the protein-DNA mixture; the drops were allowed to equilibrate by vapor diffusion against 1 ml of well solution. Crystals typically grew in 2­3 days at 16 C. The crystals varied in shape from square rods to cubes, but were never larger than 0.15 mm in the longest dimension. Ternary complex crystals grown with the wildtype polymerase did not diffract as well as those grown with the exonuclease-deficient polymerase. Cryoprotection, Soaking, and Freezing Cryoprotection and freezing conditions for the apo RB69 pol crystals had been determined previously (C.A. Brautigam, personal communication). Crystals were transferred from the mother liquor into a stabilizer solution of 2.8 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM MES (pH 5.8), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. The crystals were then transferred to a cryoprotectant, which was the same as the stabilizer except for the addition of 12% (w/v) sucrose and 6% (w/v) xylitol. After remaining in the cryoprotectant for 10­20 min, the crystals were frozen in liquid propane, using standard techniques. In contrast to the apo polymerase crystals, the high concentration of low-molecular-weight PEG in the mother liquor of the ternary complex crystals made it possible to freeze them in propane directly out of the drop in which they grew. Data Collection X-ray data were collected from apo RB69 pol crystals at beamline A1 of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS), using an ADSC CCD detector. Radiation damage was sufficiently severe, even with the crystals cooled to 100 K, that it was necessary to scale together partial datasets from two crystals to obtain a complete, high-resolution dataset. X-ray data for the ternary complex crystals were collected at beamline 5.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, using a Quantum-4 CCD detector. As with the apo polymerase, crystals were cooled to 100 K and partial datasets from two crystals were scaled together to obtain the final complete dataset. Data for all crystals were processed and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Data statistics are in Table 1. Structure Determination Refinement of the high-resolution apo-RB69 pol structure started with the previously determined structure (Wang et al., 1997), stripped of all nonprotein atoms. Structure refinement consisted of cycles of model-building using O (Jones et al., 1991), followed by positional refinement, simulated annealing with torsion-angle molecular dynamics, and individual B factor refinement, all using CNS. The improved resolution of the frozen crystals allowed the more accurate placement of amino acid side chains, as well as the correction of a few minor chain-tracing errors in the original structure. In particular, strand W of the thumb domain was out of register by one amino acid, and several residues in loop regions had their C ° positions changed by more than 3 A (specifically, residues 150, 257, 286, 301, 302, 381, 450, 508, 513, 523­528, 787­794, 799, 822­826, and 849). The current apo-polymerase structure contains 897 of the total 903 residues, missing only a poorly ordered loop in the thumb (residues 816­821). This model, like the previous apo RB69 pol structure, contains a G nucleotide bound to the N-terminal domain of the protein; this nucleotide has been modeled as a guanosine here due to a lack of convincing electron density for any phosphate groups. An initial molecular replacement solution for the ternary complex

Cell 666

was obtained using AMoRe, with the RB69 pol editing-mode structure (Shamoo and Steitz, 1999), stripped of all nonprotein atoms, as the search model. After initial refinement, inspection of A-weighted (Read, 1986) composite-omit electron density maps (Bhat, 1988) allowed the repositioning of the fingers and thumb domains into their new orientations. Further refinement of the structure consisted of model-building using O, followed by positional refinement, simulated annealing with torsion-angle molecular dynamics (Rice and Brunger, 1994), and individual atomic B factor refinement, all using CNS. This additional refinement improved the maps to the point where the DNA, dTTP, and metal ions A and B could be placed. Further cycles of CNS refinement included automated water picking; all water positions were verified manually. The stereochemical quality of the apo-polymerase and ternary complex models was assessed using Procheck (Laskowski et al., 1993). All figures in this paper were prepared using Spock (Christopher, 1998).
