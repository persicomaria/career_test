We disclose herein the discovery of estrogen receptor R (ERR) selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) of the tetrahydroisoquinoline series that incorporate novel conformationally restricted side chains as replacement of the aminoethoxy residue typical of SERMs. Molecular modeling studies used in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of the ERR ligand binding domain (LBD) with raloxifene (7) suggested a diazadecaline moiety as a viable mimic of the SERM side chain. On the basis of this knowledge, the piperidinylethoxy moiety of our lead compound 60 was replaced by a diazadecaline subunit, providing the novel tetrahydroisoquinoline 29. In addition to exhibiting a binding affinity to ERR and antagonistic properties in the estrogen response element and MCF-7 assays similar to those of the parent compound 60, ligand 29 showed a reduced agonist behavior in the MCF-7 assay in the absence of 17 -estradiol. These data point toward the fact that 29 may have a potential for breast cancer prevention/treatment in vivo, a feature which is particularly attractive in the quest for safe alternatives to hormone replacement therapy. In a pharmacokinetic experiment carried out in rats, 29 displayed an interesting profile, with a bioavailability of 49%. We also disclose the X-ray crystal structure of 29 in complex with ERR-LBD, which reveals the preferred configurations of 29 at the two chiral centers and the details of its interactions with the receptor. Finally, our structure-activity relationship studies show that other analogues bearing constrained side chains retain potency and antagonist activity and that a 3-OH substituted phenyl D-ring increases the selectivity of a set of piperazinyl-containing ligands in favor of ERR over ER .
Introduction A number of endogenous estrogens are known, and three of them, 17 -estradiol (1), estrone (2), and estriol (3) (Figure 1), are found in greater concentrations in female plasma.1 The most important endogenous estrogen is 17 -estradiol (1), which exerts its action on female reproductive functions and on numerous tissues,1 including bone.2 The efficacy of estrogens in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis has been demonstrated by various studies.3-5 Estrogens are typically administered in combination with progestins to women with an intact uterus to prevent endometrial hyperplasia. Recently, the Women's Health Initiative study has shown that the incidence of fractures is reduced in women taking the estrogen-progestin combination.6 However, this study has also demonstrated that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) leads to increased risks of breast cancer (26%), heart attacks (29%), strokes (41%), blood clots (double rate), and total

cardiovascular disease (22%).6,7 The current concerns regarding treatment with estrogens are having an impact on women's willingness to take HRT, with the risks associated with the treatment overriding the benefits. In that context, an agent capable of preventing or treating postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) but not associated with the safety concerns of estrogens and progestins would be an important addition to the portfolio of menopausal therapies. In recent years, substantial efforts have been put into the discovery of estrogen surrogates with better benefitrisk profiles. Agents that have the potential to act as estrogen in some tissues while antagonizing its action in others are known. The acronym SERMssselective estrogen receptor modulatorsshas been ascribed to such compounds.8 In fact, several SERMs are currently in advanced clinical trials (lasofoxifene (4)8-10 and bazedoxifene (5)8,11) or on the market (tamoxifen (6) for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer8 and raloxifene (7) for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis12,13) (Figure 1). Members of the SERM class are characterized by at least two common structural features: a phenolic hydroxyl group that is required for binding to the estrogen receptor R (ERR) or (ER ) and a side chain containing

a basic functionality, which confers SERMs their antagonistic properties in some tissues. The spatial orientation of the 2-aminoethoxyphenyl side chain relative to the central core of the molecule has been postulated to influence the endometrial properties of SERMs in women.14 For example, tamoxifen (6), which has a relatively flat structure, is estrogenic in the uterus and has been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer. However, raloxifene (7), which is not associated with uterine side effects in humans, features a side chain oriented orthogonally to the plane of its benzothiophene framework.14 The mechanisms by which SERMs exert their tissuespecific actions are only partly elucidated.15-17 SERMs bind with different affinities and selectivities to the two currently known estrogen receptors, ERR and ER . The two receptors, which act as ligand-activated transcription factors, are found in a wide variety of tissues and show a distinct but also overlapping distribution pattern.18-20 They regulate gene transcription either directly by binding, primarily as homo- or heterodimers, to the estrogen response element (ERE) or through protein-protein interaction with other transcription factors such as AP-1 or NF-B.19 Gene transcription is stimulated via interactions that involve the receptor, chromatin complexes, and coactivators at the ERactivated promoters.21,22 Conversely, repression of transcription occurs through recruitment of corepressors by the antagonist-bound ER.21,22 Each SERM may induce a different conformation of the ER and alter the interaction of the ligand-bound complex with a given set of coregulators. In addition, the differential expression of ERR and ER or of coregulators in various tissues may very well contribute to the formation of specific ERligand-coregulator complexes and thus elicit a tissuespecific effect.15 Although the relative contributions of ERR and ER to the spectrum of SERMs effects have only been partly

studied, there is current evidence pointing toward ERR as occupying an important role in bone remodeling. However, ER may also be a contributor to this process.23 It is not yet clear what effect an ER subtypeselective ligand would trigger on bone tissue. Considerable activity in the SERM field has contributed to the development of compounds of diverse molecular architectures. Our interest in this area led us to explore novel side chains because this is a critical moiety of the ligand. The fact that the side chain has a strong impact on the tissue-specific agonist/antagonistic properties of the molecule influences the pharmacological profile of the compound. Particularly, the stimulation of breast and endometrial tissues is a critical safety issue. Except for a report on the significance of specific elements of the aminoethoxy fragment of raloxifene analogues,24 the effects of modification of the side chain on potency and antagonistic properties of ERR-selective SERMs have not been explored.25 Herein, we report for the first time new cyclic residues as replacements of the aminoethoxy subunit characteristic of SERMs that retain potency and antagonistic activity. The synthesis and biological evaluation of these novel piperidinyl and piperazinyl derivatives of the tetrahydroisoquinoline series is described below. In addition, the X-ray crystal structure of one potent ligand, the tetrahydroisoquinoline 29, is disclosed. Chemistry The tetrahydroisoquinolines were prepared by three different routes, using either the iodophenyl intermediate 13 or bromophenyl derivatives 17a-d as starting material. The syntheses of compounds 13 and 17a-d are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. Synthesis of Intermediate Tetrahydroisoquinoline 13 via the Bischler-Napieralski Route. 3-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8) was transformed into tetrahydroisoquinoline 13 following a similar strategy as described in the literature for related compounds (Scheme 1).26 Selective benzylation of 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was accomplished readily by trapping the dianion formed upon KOH treatment (2.5 equiv) with benzyl bromide (1.05 equiv).27 Exposure of 3-benzyloxyphenylacetic acid to (COCl)2 provided the corresponding acyl chloride, which was transformed into amide 10 by reaction with aniline. Reduction of 2-(3-benzyloxyphenyl)-N-phenyl-acetamide (10) with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) led to the phenylethylphenylamine derivative 11. Acylation of this substance with 4-iodobenzoyl chloride gave amide 12. Ring closure was effected by refluxing compound 12 in POCl3 to generate an intermediate iminium ion, which was reduced with NaBH4 to the iodophenyl intermediate 13 (Scheme 1). Synthesis of Intermediate Tetrahydroisoquinolines 17a-d via the Schmidt Rearrangement. The bromophenyl intermediates 17a-d were assembled from 5-methoxyindanone (14) in four steps (Scheme 2), following a synthetic route that is shorter and is higher yielding than that described above. In addition, a broad diversity of structures could be rapidly synthesized by this flexible approach. Large quantities of bicyclic lactam 15 were accessed via the Schmidt rearrangement of indanone 14, according to a published procedure.28,29 The isoquinolin-1-one 15 proved to be a versatile

intermediate of our synthetic scheme. N-Arylation of 15 was effected under Ullmann-type conditions,30 using the appropriately substituted phenyl iodide or bromide and CuI, to provide compounds 16a-d. These compounds were then converted into the tetrahydroisoquinolines 17a-d by reaction with 4-bromophenyllithium followed by NaBH4 reduction of the intermediate iminium salts. Synthesis of Piperazine Derivatives 29-33 via the Hartwig-Buchwald Reaction. To synthesize piperazine derivatives 29-33, a palladium-catalyzed amination of the aryl iodide 13 served as the key step (Scheme 3). After investigation of a few reaction conditions, Pd2dba3 (dba ) dibenzylidene acetone) was found to catalyze the transformation efficiently, particularly in the presence of (2-dicyclohexylphosphanyl-biphenyl2-yl)-dimethylamine31 in toluene or when used in conjunction with 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-4,5-dihydroimidazolium tetrafluoroborate32-35 in dioxane. In the

latter case, the reaction could be carried out at a temperature reduced to 40 °C. When BINAP was employed as the ligand, the coupling reactions proceeded, but the yields were generally lower. tBuOK was found to be a suitable base for all cases. By use of the appropriate piperazines 18-21, the analogues 22-25 were synthesized in 53-74% yield from 13. The coupling of 2-methyl-piperazine (19) and 2-ethyl-piperazine (20) with 13 proceeded regioselectively via reaction of the least hindered amine to provide analogues 23 and 24. The tetrahydroisoquinoline 23 was then converted into the corresponding N-methyl piperazine derivative 26 by reaction with HCHO in the presence of AcOH to generate the corresponding iminium intermediate, which was subsequently reduced with NaBH3CN. The ethyl and methyl analogues 27 and 28 were prepared by the method of Abdel-Magid et al.36 Exposure of 23 to CH3CHO and 24 to HCHO in the presence of AcOH and NaBH(OAc)3 in ClCH2CH2Cl provided the N-alkyl piperazine analogues 27 and 28. Debenzylation of 22, 25, and 26-28 was achieved by treatment with HCl at 90 °C.

Synthesis of Piperidine Derivatives 38a-c,e via Suzuki Cross-Coupling Reaction. The approach pursued for the synthesis of piperidine analogues 38a-c and e is outlined in Scheme 4. Palladium-catalyzed coupling of phenyl bromides 17b-d with 4-pyridineboronic acid was effected in the presence of K2CO3 in a toluene/acetone/water mixture to provide the pyridine derivatives 35b-d in 45-75% yield. Compound 34a was prepared in a similar manner using iodide 13 as the coupling partner. Treatment of 34a and 35b-d with MeI in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 40 °C or in xylene at 140 °C provided the pyridinium salts 36a and 37bd. Reduction of these salts, followed by removal of the protecting groups, furnished the desired products 38a-c and e. Debenzylation was effected via acid treatment at 90 °C whereas demethylation was promoted by reaction with AlCl3 in the presence of EtSH. Synthesis of Piperazine Derivatives 45-50 from Lactam 16d. The N-alkylpiperazinyl derivatives 4550 were synthesized via an alternative sequence to that followed for the preparation of analogues 29-33. This route involved condensation of the appropriate 1-(4lithiophenyl)-4-alkyl-piperazine with lactam 16d to generate an iminium derivative that was reduced with NaBH4. The resultant tetrahydroisoquinolines 39-44 were then deprotected under Lewis-acid conditions (Scheme 5). The phenyllithium reagents needed for the transformation of 16d into 39-44 were generated by metal-halogen exchange of the 1-(4-bromophenyl)-4alkyl-piperazines 53-58. 4-Methyl-piperazine reagent 53 was initially synthesized by alkylation of 4-bromophenylamine (52) with bis-(2-chloroethyl)methylamine in a low yield. This protocol was clearly subop-

timal. The desired product could be obtained, however, in quantitative yield by reductive amination of 51, carried out in the presence of HCHO, AcOH, and NaBH3CN. The remaining piperazines 54-58 were also prepared via reductive amination of 51 with the appropriate aldehyde or ketone, but this transformation was effected according to the protocol of Abdel-Magid et al.36 Biology As part of our initial screening strategy, our compounds were tested in three in vitro assays. In a first instance, new derivatives were screened in a [3H]estradiol radioligand binding assay using recombinant human ERR and ER to select those substances that demonstrate affinity for the target receptor and to assess their selectivity toward one or the other receptor. The compounds were then profiled in a cellular transcription assay using HeLa cells stably transfected with human ERR or ER and estrogen response elements (ERE) upstream of a luciferase gene. In this assay, 17 estradiol induces ERE reporter gene activity. Thus, compounds able to inhibit luciferase transcription in the presence of 17 -estradiol may be classified as antagonists in this cell line. Agonists would activate gene transcription in the absence of estrogen. The ERE cellular assay also allows one to determine the ability of target derivatives to regulate transcription through ERR or ER and thus provides information with respect to the selectivity of the ligand. The third in vitro assay was used as an indicator of the ligand's behavior on tissues/cells affected by estrogen. For this purpose, new compounds were evaluated for their ability to antago-

nize the proliferative action of 17 -estradiol (1) on MCF-7 breast tumor cells. The agonist action of these analogues was also measured in the same cellular assay in the absence of estrogen. Finally, to get early insight into the pharmacokinetic properties of interesting compounds, selected candidates were profiled in rats using cassette dosing experiments. Results and Discussion High-throughput screening of our sample collection provided the fluorophenyl derivative 59 as our starting hit (Figure 2). Replacement of fluorine by a piperidinylethoxy side chain provided our lead compound 6037 (Figure 2), which displayed a binding affinity comparable to that of raloxifene (7) (IC50 ) 22 and 19 nM, for compounds 7 and 60, respectively, Table 1, entries 21 and 17). When profiled in the ERE and MCF-7 assays to assess its antagonist activity, 60 potently inhibited luciferase expression in the former assay and cell proliferation in the latter with IC50 of 16.5 and 32 nM, respectively (Table 1, entry 17).37 In the absence of 17 estradiol in the MCF-7 proliferation assay, both 60 and raloxifene (7) displayed some agonistic effects (37% and 22%, respectively). Having identified a potent lead containing the typical aminoethoxy residue, we set to evaluate ligands containing side chains with reduced conformational flexibility (Figure 2) and to evaluate the effect of these novel moieties on affinity, selectivity, and antagonist potential. Design of Cyclic Side Chains: Modeling Studies. With this aim in mind, we looked for an appropriate rigidification of the amine bearing side chain while potentially maintaining the electrostatic interaction between the alkylammonium nitrogen atom and the carboxylic acid group of Asp351 (Figure 3a). Inspection of the X-ray crystal structure of raloxifene (7) bound to the ERR ligand binding domain (LBD)38 revealed that the O-C-C-N chain adopts a near gauche conformation with a torsion angle that matches the N-C-C-N torsion angles (60°) of a piperazine in the chair conformation. We saw that substitution of the ether oxygen of raloxifene (7) by a nitrogen atom and addition of a methylene group to link the 2-piperidine carbon and the new nitrogen atom leads to a derivative that incorporates an ideal trans-diazadecaline system without changing the orientation of the basic nitrogen in the former piperidine ring of raloxifene (7) (Figures 2 and

3a). Our studies also indicated that the side chain conformation would be unaltered by replacement of the oxygen by a carbon. On the basis of this knowledge, it appeared that we could make use of an analogous modification in the tetrahydroisoquinoline series, whereby the piperidine-containing side chain of the lead tetrahydroisoquinoline 60 could be substituted by a 1,4-diazadecaline system as in 29. A model of 29 was built accordingly with the molecular modeling program Witnotp39 and optimized with Mopac/AM1.39 Superposition of modeled 29 on raloxifene (7) bound to the carboxymethylated ERR-LBD (Figure 3b) showed that 29 has the potential to bind to ERR via interactions similar to those established by 7, but with a reduced loss of torsional freedom. To confirm the validity of the model, the bicyclic piperazine derivative 29 was synthesized and its affinity for the estrogen receptors, its selectivity, and its ability to act as an antagonist in MCF-7 cells were evaluated. Other analogues, in which the diazadecaline system of 29 was replaced by 1-alkyl-, 1-alkyl-2-alkyl-piperazines, or N-methyl-piperidine residues, were also prepared to study the influence of the substitution pattern on potency and selectivity. A few derivatives with substituted aryl D rings within the N-methyl-piperidine series were synthesized to assess the influence of substituents on selectivity. At this stage of our program, the new ligands were tested either as racemates or as mixtures of diastereoisomers. The results of our investigation are reported below. Biological Results. A comparison of the in vitro data obtained for 29 and 60 reveals that the bicyclic side chain replacement is an effective mimic of the aminoethoxy side chain (Table 1, entries 1 and 17). The tetrahydroisoquinoline 29 displays good binding affinity for ERR showing an IC50 of 63 nM. When compared to that of 60, the potency of 29 in this assay is slightly reduced by 3-fold. In this context, it is thus relevant to point out that 29 was tested as a mixture of four diastereoisomers whereas 60 was evaluated as the racemate. Because there is evidence (vide infra) indicating that one isomer is responsible for the potency of the mixture, it ensues that the difference of affinity amounts to only 1.5-fold. When profiled in the ERE and MCF-7 assays, 29 and 60 were found to exhibit similar activities, within a factor of 1.5-fold in favor of 60 in the former assay and favoring 29 in the latter (Table 1, entries 1 and 17). The two most notable differences

between the two ligands lie in their selectivity profile and their agonistic effect in the MCF-7 proliferation assay. Tetrahydroisoquinoline 60 displays a stronger preference by 18-fold for ERR whereas 29 shows a 4fold selectivity for ERR over ER . In the MCF-7 cellular assay, analogue 29 clearly shows a reduced agonism (16%) relative to that displayed by 60 (37%). These data indicate that 29 may have a potential for breast cancer prevention/treatment in vivo. This feature is particularly attractive in the quest for a safe SERM as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Motivated by these results, we set to expand our knowledge of the series by evaluating other analogues in which the piperidinyl ring of the diazadecaline system was disconnected. The data demonstrate that, among the newly prepared tetrahydroisoquinolines bearing 1-alkyl-2-alkylpiperazine residues, the 1-methyl- and 1-ethyl-2-methyl-piperazine derivatives 30 and 31 ex-

hibit profiles similar to that of 29 (Table 1, entries 1-3). The 2-ethyl-piperazine analogue 32 is less active (Table 1, entry 4). Although 31 shows a marginal increase of binding affinity relative to 29 (IC50 ) 38 and 63 nM, respectively), this enhancement is not reflected in the ERE and MCF-7 assays, where the IC50 values are 64 nM and 30 nM for 31 versus 23 and 21 nM for 29. As observed for 29, the tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives 30-32 display weaker agonism (10-18%) than 60 in the MCF-7 assay in the absence of estrogen. Next, analogues lacking the 2-position substituent were prepared to evaluate the influence of this group on binding affinity and potency in vitro. The N-methylpiperazine analogue 33 (Table 1, entry 5) shows a 3and 10-fold reduction of binding affinity relative to the parent 1-methyl-2-methyl-piperazine 30 and to the aminoethoxy derivative 60, respectively. In the ERE and

MCF-7 assays, its activity is only slightly reduced by 1.6- and 1.3-fold, respectively, relative to that of 30. In an attempt to further validate our modeling studies which had suggested piperidines as potential cyclic versions of the amine bearing side chain, we prepared piperidine derivative 38a (Table 1, entry 6). The results indicate that both the piperazine and the piperidine residues (entries 5 and 6) are acceptable aminoethoxy side chain replacements, albeit the resulting ligands are slightly less potent than the parent tetrahydroisoquinolines 29 and 60 (entries 1 and 17). Looking at the impact of the substitution pattern around the phenyl D ring for a small subset of Nmethyl-piperidine analogues (Table 1, entries 6-9), we discovered that the presence of a 3-hydroxy group increased the selectivity toward ERR in both the binding and the ERE assays (Table 1, entry 9). Aiming to exploit this finding and to further probe the potential effect of N-alkyl groups on selectivity, we prepared a number of tetrahydroisoquinolines, embedding a 3-hydroxyphenyl D ring. In view of the fact that both the piperazine and the piperidine side chains have a similar impact on potency and that the piperazine analogues were more readily prepared, we carried out our studies with derivatives of the piperazine series. Comparison of the

N-methyl piperazines 33 and 45 (Table 1, entries 5 and 10) confirms the trend observed for the piperidine analogues whereby a meta-OH group increases selectivity in favor of ERR. The other piperazine ligands 4650 (Table 1, entries 11-15) display IC50 values in the radioligand binding assay that vary from 83 to 177 nM and show selectivities for ERR over ER that range between 7-16-fold. These new piperazines display similar potency to that of the diazadecaline derivative 29 in the ERE assay and an activity reduced by 2-5fold in the MCF-7 assay. Interestingly, the variation in the basic character of the nitrogen interacting with Asp351 by up to 1.4 log units does not significantly affect affinity. The pKavalues of the alkyl nitrogens for the N-methyl-piperazine 33, the cyclopropyl-methyl-piperazine 48, and the N-methyl-piperidine 38a are 7.8, 8.0, and 9.2, respectively. In comparison, the lead tetrahydroisoquinoline 60 displays a pKa of 8.5 for its piperidine nitrogen. As a result of our studies, we established that the aminoethoxy subunit of 60 can be replaced effectively by piperazine or piperidine moieties while maintaining activity and antagonist potential. In addition, we found that the analogues with constrained side chains present a superior profile relative to that of the parent in that they display reduced agonism in the MCF-7 assay. The diazadecaline residue was identified as the best side chain replacement. Because 29 is a mixture of four diastereoisomers, we questioned whether one or more isomers were contributing to the activity. There are literature precedents indicating that one enantiomer of SERMs such as lasofoxifene (4),10 NNC 45-0781,41 and EM-65242 is more potent than the other. In the case of lasofoxifene (4),10 for example, the 1-R, 2-S absolute configuration was attributed to the most potent enantiomer as illustrated in Figure 1. On the basis of our own results37 and on published literature data, it appeared likely that the most active isomer of 29 would possess an R absolute configuration at C-1 of the tetrahydroisoquinoline nucleus. However, the importance of the configuration at the diazadecaline fragment remained to be confirmed. Our molecular modeling studies indicated that the preferred absolute configuration of the diazadecaline side chain would be S. An X-ray crystal structure of 29 in complex with ERR-LBD corroborated our assumption regarding the absolute configuration at C1 and the results of the modeling studies, in addition to providing the details of the ligand-protein interactions. X-ray Crystal Structure Cocrystallization of the Cys f Ser triple mutant hERR-LBD 301-553 with a mixture containing the four diastereomers of 29 provided crystals diffracting to at least 2.05 Å that were suitable for X-ray analysis. This new crystal form for ERR-LBD contains four monomers (denoted A, B, C, and D) per asymmetric unit which form two dimers (AB and CD). The final model contains residues 307-330, 341-461, 464-528, and 535-548 for monomers A and C and residues 307-330, 341-461, 464-525, and 535-548 for monomers B and D (the missing regions correspond to flexible loops), as well as 374 water molecules and 4 ligand molecules 29 (denoted L, M, N, and O).

The X-ray crystal structure ascertains that only one diastereoisomer of 29 (that with the R-configuration at the C1 position of the tetrahydroisoquinoline core and the S-configuration at the bicyclic piperazine residue) binds within the cavity of the ERR-LBD (Figure 4). Its positioning within the binding cleft is reminiscent of that observed for 6037 and other SERMs.38 The backbone of tetrahydroisoquinoline 29 establishes a number of van der Waals contacts with the residues forming the binding pocket. The tetrahydroisoquinoline ligand 29 is further anchored within the binding cavity via a network of hydrogen bonds established between its phenolic hydroxyl and the side chains of Glu353 and Arg394. Its piperazinyl phenyl side chain protrudes through a narrow channel and adopts a position which allows a salt-bridge interaction with Asp351. The electron density indicates that the two anilinic nitrogens of 29 are slightly nonplanar as predicted by our model of 29. An overlay of the X-ray structures of ERR-LBDs bound to 29, to the parent tetrahydroisoquinoline 60 (Figure 4) or to raloxifene (7) (Figure 5) shows that their basic side chains adopt similar positions (stabilized by the interaction with Asp351), despite differences in their crystal forms. As predicted by molecular modeling, the diazadecaline moiety of 29 nicely superimposes over the piperidinylethoxy side chain of 60 (Figure 4). The first ring of the bicyclic residue of 29, apart from rigidifying the side chain, also participates in hydrophobic contacts with Trp383. However, this increased stabilization does not translate into an improvement in binding affinity. Pharmacokinetic Properties To examine the pharmacokinetic properties of our ligands, we profiled a few selected candidates in a pharmacokinetic (PK) cassette dosing experiment carried out in rats (Table 2). For that purpose, the diaza-

decaline analogue 29, the N-iPr-piperazine derivative 46 which incorporates a 3-position hydroxyphenyl residue, and the N-methyl-piperidine 38b bearing a 4-position fluorophenyl moiety were chosen. These tetrahydroisoquinolines display good absolute oral bioavailabilities (BAV) (44-64%, Table 2, entries 3-5) and maximal blood concentrations which range between 27 and 57 nM (Cmax, po, dose-normalized). The values found for 29, 38b, and 46 compare very favorably with those obtained for the parent tetrahydroisoquinoline 60 (BAV, 42%; Cmax, 31 nM; Table 2, entry 6) and are superior to those exhibited by lasofoxifene (4, Table 2, entry 1, BAV, 38%; Cmax, 15.5 nM) and raloxifene (7, Table 2, entry 2; BAV, 22%; Cmax, 7.5 nM). The volumes of distribution at steady state (Vss) for the various tetrahydroisoquinolines range from 9 to 16 L/kg, with the exception of the meta hydroxy derivative 46 that is associated with a lower Vss (5 L/kg), a value indicating that this compound may have a higher protein binding. Conclusion In this paper, we reported the results of our investigations aimed at the discovery of selective estrogen receptor modulators with conformationally restricted side chains. The information resulting from the X-ray crystal structure of hERR in complex with raloxifene (7) used in conjunction with modeling studies directed our synthetic work toward the preparation of analogues of the tetrahydroisoquinoline series that incorporate cyclic side chains as surrogates for the aminoethoxy residue. Both piperazine and piperidine derivatives were found to retain affinity for ERR and, importantly, antagonistic properties when compared to the parent compound 60. In addition, all of the new derivatives displayed weaker agonism in the MCF-7 assay relative to that of lasofoxifene (4), raloxifene (7), and tetrahydroisoquinoline 60.

The most potent analogue, tetrahydroisoquinoline 29, embeds the diazadecaline side chain, which acts as an excellent mimic of the traditional SERM residue. In addition to being potent in functional assays, 29 displays a very good oral bioavailability (49%) in a cassette dosing experiment carried out in rats. On the basis of both its in vitro and PK profile, 29 was identified as the optimal compound within that series and warrants further in vivo evaluation. Experimental Section
Chemistry. General. All of the commercial chemicals and solvents are reagent grade and were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. All of the reactions except those in aqueous media were carried out under an atmosphere of N2, in flame-dried glassware. Reactions were monitored by analytical reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Hewlett-Packard series 1100, equipped with a diode array spectrometer ( ) 210-250 nm) and a Waters Symmetry C-8 column (3.5 µm, 2.1 mm × 50 mm) as the stationary phase. The mobile phases used were A, 95:5 H2O/CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA, and B, CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA. The program employed ran as follows: 0-7 min, 5% B f 100% B; 7-8.5 min, 100% B; at 8.5 min, 5% B for 2.5 min, prior to the next run. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 mL/min. Additionally, thin-layer chromatography on 0.25 mm silica gel plates (E. Merck, silica gel 60 F254) was used to follow the reactions. Visualization was accomplished with UV light, KMnO4, or 5% phosphomolybdic acid in 95% ethanol. Intermediates and final compounds were purified by flash chromatography (E. Merck silica gel 60, 230-400 mesh), crystallization, or semipreparative reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) using a Gilson model 306 equipped with a UVvis detector ( usually set to 214 nm) and a Symmetry Prep RP18 (7 µm, 19 mm × 150 mm column) as the stationary phase. The eluents employed were A, H2O containing 0.1%TFA, and B, CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA. The program ran as follows: 0-0.5 min, 100% B; 0.5-3 min, 10% B; the compound was automatically injected at 3 min; from 3 to 4 min, 10% B; thereafter, a linear gradient was then run from 10% B to 100% B over the next 16 min followed by a 2.0 min hold at 100% B. The flow rate was held constant at 20 mL/min. NMR spectra were recorded either on a Varian spectrometer, model Mercury-300 or -400, or on a Bruker DPX-400, DMX-500, or DRX-500. Signal positions ( values) were calibrated using the residual undeuterated solvent resonance as the internal standard. The multiplicity is indicated by one of the following: d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet; br, broad. Infrared spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer i-Series FT-IR microscope coupled with a SPECTRUM 2000 FT-IR spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a Finnigan MAT900.

Lactam 16d was allowed to undergo reaction with the appropriate phenyllithium reagent in THF (0.04-0.05 M) for 1-2.5 h at -78 °C. For the syntheses of 41 and 43, the reaction mixtures were stirred for 10 min at -78 °C and then allowed to warm to room temperature, for total reaction times of 60 and 40 min, respectively. In the case of 44, the mixture was stirred at -78 °C for 45 min following addition of the amide 16d and allowed to warm to room temperature for 45 min. After aqueous workup and isolation, the iminium salt was dissolved in MeOH or 8:1 MeOH/CH2Cl2 (0.06-0.09 M) and treated with NaBH4 (2-2.2 equiv) at room temperature for 15-60 min. After that period of time, the product was isolated and purified. Tetrahydroisoquinolines 39-44 were obtained in yields ranging from 59 to 87%. A representative example is given below.

The structure factors and the coordinates of the refined structure were deposited in the protein structure database (PDB ID code: 1XQC). Biological Assays. Radioligand Binding Studies. The radioligand binding assay was performed by using 96-well microtiterplates (Picoplates, Packard) in volumes of 0.2 mL of incubation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4). The incubation mixture contained 5 nM ERR (PanVera, USA) or 6 nM ER long form human recombinant receptors (PanVera,), 8 nM [3H] 17 -estradiol (180 000 total counts, Perkin-Elmer NET 517, USA), and the compound to be tested and 0.25 mg/well SPAbeads (Amersham RPNQ 0001). After incubation at room temperature for 2-4 h, the reaction was terminated by centrifugation at room temperature (10 min at 1000g). The radioactivity was counted at least 3 h after completion of the experiment in a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was defined as the remaining radioactivity in the presence of 10 µM nonradioactive 17 -estradiol (Sigma). Assays were performed in triplicate. MCF-7 Proliferation Assay. The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, MCF-7 (ATCC HTB-22), was routinely cultivated in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified eagle medium, high glucose, Gibco Invitrogen Corporation, Paisley, U.K.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 50 IU/mL penicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycine (pen/ strep) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Three days prior to an assay, MCF-7 cells were switched to DMEM low glucose phenol red free,43 supplemented with 10% dextrancoated charcoal-stripped FBS (sFBS) to deplete internal stores of steroids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes, and penicillin/ streptomycin. Cells were trypsinized from the maintenance flask with phenol red free trypsin (0.05%)-EDTA (0.02%) (HyClone, Logan, UT) and seeded in a 96-well plate (Nunc) at a density of 103 cells per final volume of 100 µL DMEM low glucose phenol red free, supplemented with 5% sFBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes, and penicillin/streptomycin. After 24 h, fresh medium, supplemented with serial dilutions of compounds or DMSO as diluent control, was prepared and added in the presence or absence of 10-10 M 17 -estradiol to triplicate microcultures. Cells were incubated for 6 days, and medium with compounds was changed once after 3 days. At the end of the incubation time, proliferation was assessed using the CellTiter 96 aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured. This parameter relates to the amount of formazan

produced, the quantity of which is directly proportional to the number of living cells in the culture. ERE-Luciferase Reporter Assay. HELNR and HELN , two human cervix adenocarcinoma cell lines derived from HeLa cells stably transfected with the reporter gene EREGlob-Luc-SVNeo and the expression plasmids ERR or ER , respectively, were used to quantify the antiestrogenic and estrogenic effects of compounds on ERE.44,45 These cells were routinely cultivated in DMEM phenol red free, supplemented with 5% sFBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mg/mL Geneticin, and 0.5 µg/mL puromycin to ensure appropriate antibiotic selection. For the assay, cells were trypsinized from the maintenance flask with phenol red free trypsin (0.05%)-EDTA (0.02%) (HyClone, Logan, UT) and seeded in an opaque 96-well plate (Nunc) at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well in a final volume of 100 µL of assay medium (DMEM, phenol red free, supplemented with 3% sFBS, 2 mM glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin). Five hours later, cells were adherent. Serial dilutions of compounds or DMSO as diluent control were then added in the presence of a fixed concentration of 17 -estradiol (10-10 M in HELNR and 10-9 M in HELN ) to triplicate microcultures. Faslodex (Tocris, 10-8 M) was used as a baseline indicator. Cells were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator before being processed for luciferase determination. Medium was aspirated and 100 µL of a 1:1 mixture of LucLite (Perkin-Elmer, Life Science, Boston, MA)/assay medium was added to each well. Plates were then sealed with a Topseal and left in the dark for 10 min before luminescence activity was determined by counting the plates for 6 s in a -TopCount (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford Micromethod (Bio-Rad). Luciferase was expressed in relative luminescence units/µg protein. Cassette Dosing Experiments. Rat Pharmacokinetic Cassette Standard Assay. A set of seven novel compounds plus the internal standard raloxifene (7) was administered intravenously via the femoral vein at a dose level of 1 mg/kg of body weight (for each individual compound) to four female rats. Cannulas were implanted into the femoral vein for intravenous compound administration and into the femoral artery for rapid blood sampling. Compounds were administered orally by gavage at a dose level of 5 mg/kg of body weight. Blood was sampled over a 24 h time period postdose (from 5 min for iv and 15 min for po). Blood samples were then processed through steps involving protein precipitation by CH3CN addition, centrifugation of the supernatant, and evaporation of the supernatant in a vacuum centrifuge. Dried residues were dissolved in MeOH/H2O (60:40 v/v) containing 1% HCOOH and analyzed by HPLC on an Uptisphere C18 reversed-phase HPLC column (particle size, 3 µm; column dimensions, 2 mm × 50 mm). Eluents used consisted of A, 10% CH3CN in H2O with 0.1% HCOOH (pH 2.1), and B, 90% CH3CN with 10% H2O and 0.1% HCOOH (pH 2.1). A linear gradient was run from 5 to 100% B over 7 min followed by a 3 min hold at 100% B at a constant temperature of 50 °C in the column compartment. The flow rate was held constant at 0.4 mL/min. Sample injection volume was 10 µL. The flow from the HPLC system was directly introduced into the ion source of an Agilent 1100 series MS detector (single quadrupole mass analyzer) and subjected to atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization (positive mode). All compounds were detected as protonated quasi-molecular ions [M + H]+. A structurally closely related SERM was used as an analytical internal standard. Quantification of blood levels of the parent compounds was based on a seven-level calibration curve (in triplicate) using blank rat blood samples spiked with stock solutions of external and internal standards. Rat Pharmacokinetic Cassette Validation. Raloxifene (7) alone was administered iv (1 mg/kg) and po (3 mg/kg) to four female rats each. Blood samples were taken and analyzed as described above. The pharmacokinetic data generated from this validation study were compared with those obtained for raloxifene (7) in cassette dosing experiments to check for
