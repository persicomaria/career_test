SUMMARY: We have investigated the kinetics of the binding of guanine nucleotides to bovine brain rhoB p20, a ras p21-1ike GTPbinding protein with GTPase activity. The initial velocities of the binding of guanosine 5'-(3-_O-thio)triphosphate (GTPTS) to GDPbound rhoB p20 and the dissociation_of GDP from this protein were Z+ markedly increased by decreasing Mg concentrations. The initial velocity of the binding_of GTPTS to GDP-free rhoB p20 was not Z+ affected by changing Mg concentrations. These results indicate that the dissociation of GDP from rhoB p20 limits the binding of GTP to this protein, and suggest that there is a factor stimulating the dissociation of GDP from rhoB p20 and thereby stimulating the binding of GTP to this protein in mammalian tissues. Consistently, the factor stimulating the dissociation of GDP, but not of GTPTS, from rhoB p20 was detected in bovine brain cytosol, e 1989
