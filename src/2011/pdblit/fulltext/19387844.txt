Biological context Insulin stimulates glucose transport into striated (skeletal and cardiac) muscle and adipose tissue via the insulinresponsive glucose transporter GLUT4 (Chang et al. 2004). Since GLUT4 is continually recycled between general endocytotic compartments and specialized GLUT4 storage compartments (Bryant et al. 2002; Watson et al. 2004), the vast majority of GLUT4 resides within the cell in the basal state. Activation of insulin receptors by insulin binding triggers the relocation of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell surface (Jhun et al. 1992; Czech and Buxton 1993; Yang and Holman 1993). This increases the amount of GLUT4 on the plasma membrane and enhances glucose uptake into adipocytes and muscle cells (Bryant et al. 2002; Watson et al. 2004). CIP4 (Cdc42-interacting protein 4) was identified as a regulatory protein of GLUT4 relocation (Lodhi et al. 2007). CIP4 contains an N-terminal FCH domain (the nonkinase domain of the FER and Fes/Fps family of tyrosine

kinases) (Itoh et al. 2005), two central coiled-coil motifs and a C-terminal SH3 domain. The FCH domain together with the first coiled-coil motif interact with microtubules (Tian et al. 2000), while the second coiled-coil motif (comprising 332 to 425 of CIP4) is required for association with Rho-family GTPase proteins, Cdc42 (Aspenstrom 1997) and TC10 (Chang et al. 2002). The C-terminal SH3 domain associates with Gapex-5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab31 (Lodhi et al. 2007). The CIP4 is predominantly located in intracellular compartments in adipocytes under basal conditions, but is relocated to the plasma membrane to bind GTP-loaded TC10 upon insulin stimulation (Chang et al. 2002). With the relocation of CIP4, Gapex-5 is also recruited to the plasma membrane. The Rab31 is found in the intracellular GLUT4-containing compartment, and is involved in the trafficking between endocytotic compartments and GLUT4 storage compartments (Lodhi et al. 2007). Translocation of the CIP4Gapex-5 complex upon insulin stimulation abolishes the interaction of Gapex-5 with Rab31 and leads to a decrease in the amount of activated Rab31; therefore, it is thought to be one of the mechanisms by which the exocytosis of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane is increased (Lodhi et al. 2007). Translocation of CIP4 is mediated by association with GTP-loaded TC10 localized at the plasma membrane. Insulin-stimulated activation of TC10 is indispensable for CIP4 translocation (Chang et al. 2002). Since the TC10 and Cdc42 binding region of CIP4 does not contain a known interaction motif that includes the CRIB (Cdc42 and Rac Interactive Binding) region (Chang et al. 2002), a plausible interaction mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report the solution structure of CIP4332­425 and study the mode of interaction of CIP4332­425 with both TC10 and Cdc42.

Methods and results The CIP4332­425 was cloned into pGB1HPS (Kobashigawa et al. 2009) plasmid and expressed in E. coli at 25°C as GB1fusion protein. The GB1, hexahistidine tags and a HRV3C protease cleavage site was fused to the N-terminus of CIP4332­425. The protein was isotopically 13C- and 15Nlabeled by growing an E. coli strain Rossetta2 (DE3) in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl (1 g/l) and 13C-glucose (4 g/l) as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Cells were grown at 37°C in M9 medium. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thiob-galctopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM at 25°C. The cells were then cultured at 25°C and lysed. The GB1- and hexahistidine-tag fused CIP4332­425 was purified using a Ni-NTA resin (Quiagen), and the GB1 and hexahistidine tags were cleaved from CIP4332­425 with HRV3C protease. The CIP4332­425 was then further purified using a Superdex75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Finally, CIP4332­425 was concentrated to 0.5 mM and applied to NMR experiments. All NMR measurements were carried out at 25°C and the sample was prepared in 20 mM MES buffer (pH 6.3) and 150 mM NaCl in the presence of 1 mM DTT. Using the same buffer as was used in the NMR experiments, we applied CIP4332­425 to gel filtration chromatography and confirmed that CIP4332­425 exists in monomer in solution (Supplementary Fig. 1). Retention time of CIP4332­425 (11.5 kDa) was faster than GB1 (6.5 kDa), comparable with myoglobin (17.5 kDa) and slower than chymotripsinogen-A (25 kDa). As described below, CIP4332­425 exhibits anisotropic structure with the ° ° long axis of 70 A and the short axis of 27 A, and is deviated from the globular shape and therefore, it is reasonable that CIP4332­425 was eluted faster in gel filtration than expected from its molecular weight. Two- and three-dimensional NMR experiments were performed on Varian UNITY Inova spectrometers operating at 800 and 600 MHz. Spectra were processed using the NMRPipe program (Delaglio et al. 1995) and data analysis was performed with the help of the Sparky program (Kneller and Goddard 1997). 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments were carried out using the following suite of spectra; 1H-15N HSQC, 1H-13C HSQC, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA (CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCO, (HCA)CO(CA)NH, HBHA (CO)NH, HN(CA)HA, HC(C)H-TOCSY, (H)CCH-TOCSY, HbCbCgCdHd, HbCbCgCdCeHe, and HACAN. All the backbone amide proton and nitrogen resonances were assigned and nearly complete side-chain resonance assignments were accomplished. The 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced to DSS according to IUPAC recommendations. Interproton distance restraints for structural calculations were obtained from 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra using a mixing time

of 100 ms. The structure was calculated using the CYANA 2.1 software package (Herrmann et al. 2002). A total of 2,325 distance restraints were used as input for the final calculation of the three-dimensional structure of CIP4332­425 (Table 1). At each stage, 100 structures were calculated using 30,000 steps of simulated annealing, and a final ensemble of 20 structures was selected based on CYANA target function values. The atomic coordinates and resonance assignments have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 2KE4) and BMRB (BMRB code: 16129), respectively. The overlay of the final ensemble of 20 structures and the ribbon model of the lowest energy structure of CIP4332­425 are shown in Fig. 1a, b, respectively. The Nterminal residues (332­338) exhibited flexible random structure characteristics. The core structure of CIP4332­425 spanning 339­421 consists of two a-helices, which pack together into an anti-parallel coiled-coil structure. The packing between the two helices was mediated by a regular array of Leu, Ile and Val residues located at sites a and d of the chemical wheel (Fig. 1c). To identify the TC10 and Cdc42 binding sites of CIP4332­425, non-labeled GTPcS-loaded TC10 and Cdc42 were titrated to 15N-labeled CIP4332­425. The GB1-tagged TC101­185 and Cdc421­179 were prepared in a manner similar to CIP4332­425 as described above. We used TC101­185 (Q67L) and Cdc421­179 (Q61L), constitutive active mutants that lack GTPase activity. GTPcS was loaded as described previously (Feltham et al. 1997). Upon addition of GTPcSloaded TC101­185 (Q67L) and Cdc421­179 (Q61L), several amide peaks disappeared in an intermediate exchange process (Fig. 2a left and right panel). Almost identical peaks of CIP4332­425 disappeared in both GTPcS-loaded TC101­185 (Q67L) and Cdc421­179 (Q61L) complexes, indicating that CIP4332­425 binds to both activated G proteins using the same region. The peaks that disappeared at an equivalent

molar ratio of GTPase to CIP332­425 were mapped on the CIP4332­425 structure (Fig. 2b). They were located at the tip of the CIP4332­425 that includes the C-terminal region of the first helix, the loop between the helices and the N-terminal region of the second helix. Most of the peaks disappeared due to precipitation of the sample at 1.5 equivalent molar ratio of GTPase to CIP332­425, which prevents us from estimation of dissociation constant and observation of the NMR spectra at full saturation.

Discussion We compared the structure of CIP4332­425 with those deposited in the Protein Data Bank using the Dali search

engine (Holm and Sander 1995). Both the protein kinase C-related kinase 1 (PRK1) HR1a domain bound to GTPloaded RhoA (Maesaki et al. 1999; PDB code 1CXZ; Z score 7.8) and the HR1b domain associated with GTPloaded Rac1 (Modha et al. 2008; PDB code 2RMK; Z score 7.1) showed a structure similar to CIP4332­425. It should be noted that RhoA and Rac1 are classified into the Rho-family of small GTPase proteins like TC10 and Cdc42. HR1a and HR1b in complex form an anti-parallel coiled-coil structure with interfacial hydrophobic residues similar to that of CIP4332­425 between the two helices. In the crystal structure of the RhoA-HR1a complex, HR1a binds to two different sites named contact I and contact II (Fig. 3a, b). On the other hand, the NMR structure of the Rac1-HR1b complex showed that HR1b binds to Rac1 at

contact II (Fig. 3c, d). At contact I, HR1a binds to RhoA using the central region of the antiparallel coiled-coil structure, though using the opposite surface to that of contact II (Fig. 3b). At contact II, both HR1a and HR1b are bound to GTPases including the tip of the coiled-coil structure (Fig. 3b (upper), d). This is similar to the interaction of CIP4332­425 with TC10 and Cdc42 identified from the present titration studies (Fig. 2a). Moreover, it should be noted that contact II extensively interacts with the switch I and switch II regions of RhoA and Rac1, while contact I does not (Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3). Since binding of Cdc42 and TC10 to CIP4332­425 was reported to be GTP dependent (Aspenstrom 1997; Chang et al. 2002), contact II is more plausible as the binding site of CIP4332­425. Considering the structure of CIP4332­425 and the results of the titration experiment, it might be assumed that CIP4332­425 binds both TC10 and Cdc42 at contact II. Further study, however, will be required including structure determination of the complex and the mutational analysis. Finally, this is the first report on the structure of the TC10 effector, which plays a crucial role in the translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane to enhance glucose uptake in response to insulin stimulation.
