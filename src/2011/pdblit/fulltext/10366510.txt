Comparison of the recently determined three-dimensional structures of several glutamate dehydrogenases allowed for the identi®cation of a ®veresidue ion-pair network in the hinge region of Pyrococcus furiosus glutamate dehydrogenase (melting temperature 113 C), that is not present in the homologous glutamate dehydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (melting temperature 93 C). In order to study the role of this ion-pair network, we introduced it into the T. maritima enzyme using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. The resulting T. maritima glutamate dehydrogenases N97D, G376 K and N97D/G376 K as well as the wild-type enzyme were overproduced in Escherichia coli and subsequently puri®ed. Elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the double mutant N97D/ Ê G376 K at 3.0 A, showed that the designed ion-pair interactions were indeed formed. Moreover, because of interactions with an additional charged residue, a six-residue network is present in this double mutant. Melting temperatures of the mutant enzymes N97D, G376 K and N97D/ G376 K, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry, did not differ signi®cantly from that of the wild-type enzyme. Identical transition midpoints in guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation experiments were found for the wild-type and all mutant enzymes. Thermal inactivation at 85 C occured more than twofold faster for all mutant enzymes than for the wild-type glutamate dehydrogenase. At temperatures of 65 C and higher, the wild-type and the three mutant enzymes showed identical speci®c activities. However, at 58 C the speci®c activity of N97D/G376 K and G376 K was found to be signi®cantly higher than that of the wildtype and N97D enzymes. These results suggest that the engineered ionpair interactions in the hinge region do not affect the stability towards temperature or guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation but rather affect the speci®c activity of the enzyme and the temperature at which it functions optimally.

Introduction
During recent years an increasing amount of genetic, biochemical and structural data have become available of enzymes isolated from hyperthermophilic Bacteria and Archaea. This has allowed for an extensive comparison with data obtained from moderate thermophiles, mesophiles

and psychrophiles, in order to determine the molecular basis for adaptations to high temperatures. In many cases the involvement of charged residues has been proposed, including optimized electrostatic interactions (Spassov & Atanasov, 1994; Spassov et al., 1995), increased numbers of ionÈ pairs (Korndorfer et al., 1995; Hennig et al., 1997), and extensive ion-pair networks (Yip et al., 1995; Hennig et al., 1995; Knapp et al., 1997; Russell et al., 1997). Several studies involving single, surfacelocated salt bridges in T4 lysozyme have shown

288 that their contribution to the stability of the protein is only marginal (0.1 to 0.25 kcal/mol) because the gain in free energy of folding is about equal to the entropic cost of dehydration and the reduction of the conformational freedom (Dao-pin et al., 1991; Horovitz et al., 1990). However, theoretical considerations indicate that extensive networks may play an important role in maintaining enzyme stability or function at extreme temperatures. First, each extra ion-pair added to the network requires the desolvation and localization of only a single residue. In addition, networks are often located in cavities and at interfaces where their conformational freedom is already restricted. As a consequence, part of the entropic cost has already been provided during the folding of the protein. Finally, hydration effects play a minor role at high temperatures and the dielectric constant decreases with temperature, resulting in an increased electrostatic energy upon formation of a salt bridge. Studies on the functionality of electrostatic interactions in hyperthermostable enzymes are limited to the deletion of either isolated ion-pairs or the disruption of small ion-pair networks in Thermotoga maritima glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Tomschy et al., 1994; Pappenberger et al., 1997). Removal of the side-chain from the central arginine in a four-residue network resulted in faster thermal denaturation of the mutant, suggesting that ion-pair interactions do indeed contribute to the stability of the enzyme (Pappenberger et al., 1997). The question remains, however, if stability in systems like this would be affected if only the ionic interaction was removed, without introducing cavities. Here we have taken the complementary approach by introducing an ion-pair network that is present in a thermostable model enzyme, into a less thermostable counterpart. Apart from studying the effects on stability, the effects on catalytic ef®ciency and temperature optimum were investigated as well. These characteristics all have to be adapted to high temperatures, but especially the latter two have not yet received much attention. The well-studied enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is, for several reasons, an excellent model. Three-dimensional structures have been solved for GDHs from the mesophilic bacterium Clostridium symbiosum (Baker et al., 1992), the hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima (Knapp et al., 1997) and the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (Yip et al., 1995). All these GDHs consist of six identical subunits, each of which can be divided into a substrate- and a cofactor-binding domain (Baker et al., 1992). During catalysis, the cofactor binding domain rotates with respect to the substrate binding domain, thereby opening and closing the cleft in between the two domains where the active site is located (Stillman et al., 1993). Residues and interactions in the socalled hinge region connecting the two domains, are thought to mediate this movement and therefore are assumed to play an important role in determining activity and stability of the enzyme

(Yip et al., 1995; Knapp et al., 1997). Comparison of those structures and a homology modelling study involving GDHs from ten different sources (Yip et al., 1998), showed a strong correlation of the number of ion-pairs and the extent of ion-pair networks with the thermostability of the enzyme. We previously cloned, sequenced and overexpressed in Escherichia coli the gdh genes from the hyperthermophilic archaeal and bacterial representatives P. furiosus and T. maritima, respectively (Eggen et al., 1993; Lebbink et al., 1995; Kort et al., 1997). P. furiosus GDH overproduced by E. coli has successfully been used in protein engineering experiments to study the contribution of the different domains to activity and stability of GDH (Lebbink et al., 1995). The glutamate dehydrogenases from P. furiosus and T. maritima share 55% amino acid identity and are very homologous in secondary and tertiary structure as well (root-mean-square deviation of Ê 3.5 A for the Ca positions of the cofactor binding Ê domain and 2.2 A for the Ca positions of the substrate binding domain). However, the P. furiosus GDH has a higher melting point (tm  113 C; Klump et al., 1992) and contains signi®cantly larger ion-pair networks than the T. maritima GDH (tm  93 C; Knapp et al., 1997). We studied the role of a ®ve-residue ion-pair network that is located in the hinge region of the GDH from P. furiosus by introducing the involved charged amino acids into the GDH from T. maritima. Subsequently, the biochemical and structural properties of the mutant GDHs were compared to those of the wild-type T. maritima GDH.

Results
Design, production and structure of mutant and wild-type T.maritima GDHs The major difference between the hinge regions of the GDHs from P. furiosus and T. maritima, is the presence of a ®ve-residue ion-pair network in the P. furiosus enzyme that is absent in the less stable GDH. This ®ve-residue ion-pair network links secondary structure elements from both domains, is surface exposed, and located oppositely to the subÊ strate binding site at a distance of more than 12 A (Figure 1). The ®ve participating residues are positioned in such a way that four salt bridges are formed, i.e. between R64-D97, D97-K379, K379D383 and D383-R406. Two of those salt bridges cross the domain interface: D97-K379 linking the loop between a-helix 3 and b-sheet d (substrate binding domain) with a-helix 13 (cofactor binding domain), and D383-R406 linking a-helix 13 (cofactor binding domain) with a-helix 14 (substrate binding domain; Figure 2(a)). In the less stable T. maritima GDH the corresponding residues in a structure-based alignment are R64, N97, G376, D380 and R403; consequently only the salt bridge between D380 and R403 is present (Figure 2(b)).

289 this double mutant GDH was subsequently Ê re®ned at 3.0 A. Its overall structure is unchanged; the Ca positions of the subunits differ Ê with an r.m.s.d. of only 0.13 A when compared with the wild-type T. maritima GDH structure. The absence of density for residue 97 in the difference Fourier map (Figure 3(a)) indicates that the aspartate in the double mutant has adopted a similar conformation to the asparagine which is present in the wild-type GDH. The introduced lysine side chain adopts a similar conformation to the P. furiosus GDH structure (Table 2). Its environment is conserved and no other interactions than with D380 and D97 are formed. Comparison of the structure of the double mutant with that from the P. furiosus GDH revealed that the ®ve-residue network is even extended to a larger network in the double mutant GDH (Figure 2(c)). In addition to the ®ve P. furiosus residues, the network involves also amino acids E177 in subunit C which is in close proximity to R64 (in subunit A), and K383 which forms now a salt bridge to D380. These two ion-pairs are also present in the wild-type T. maritima GDH structure. The conformation of D380 is identical in P. furiosus wild-type and T. maritima wild-type and double mutant GDHs, indicating that the extra ion-pair interaction with K383 does not change the geometry of the remaining part of the salt-bridge network. Residue E177 is disordered in the wild-type GDH (Knapp et al., 1997) as well as in the double mutant. Therefore, almost no density has been observed beyond the Cb atom and the side-chain has been modelled by a database rotamer. Hence it is not expected that E177 interacts strongly with R64 but will be rather ¯exible, and this residue is therefore not considered as contributing to the network. Comparing the environment of the ion-pair network in P. furiosus GDH to the situation in the double mutant, we observed, apart from the two extra ion-pair interactions, only one additional differÊ ence within 4.0 A distance of any of the participating residues. This concerns valine 402 in P. furiosus GDH which is isoleucine 399 in Ê T. maritima GDH at 3 A distance from the Cb of D380. This difference is compensated for by a nearby change from isoleucine 387 in P. furiosus GDH to valine 384 in T. maritima GDH.

Figure 1. Schematic drawing of a wild-type T. maritima GDH subunit. The upper (N-terminal) domain binds the substrate in the cleft in between the two domains, the lower domain (C-terminal) binds the cofactor along its surface that is facing the upper domain (Baker et al., 1992; Stillman et al., 1993). The secondary structure elements linked by the ion-pair network in the double mutant and P. furiosus GDH are highlighted in blue. The Figure has been generated with the programme MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) together with the rendering programme Raster3D (Bacon & Anderson, 1988; Merrit & Murphy, 1994).

In order to introduce the ®ve-residue network into the hinge of T. maritima GDH, residues N97 and G376 of T. maritima GDH were mutated to the P. furiosus residues D97 and K379 using a PCRbased method. Production of the wild-type T. maritima GDH and the N97D, G376 K and N97D/G376 K mutant enzymes in E. coli in all instances exceeded 5% of total cell protein. The wild-type and mutant T. maritima GDHs were puri®ed to homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE, and used for further structural and biochemical analysis. Double mutant N97D/G376 K has been crystallized under conditions similar to those described for the wild-type T. maritima GDH (Knapp et al., 1997) and in the same spacegroup (P31 2 1) with identical cell dimensions (Table 1). The side-chain of the lysine residue introduced at position 376 could easily be built into a 6-fold map (not averaged (2FMu À FWT)exp(iaWT) O C C shown). In addition, the density of the lysine side-chain was clearly visible in a (FMu À FWT)exp(iaWT) difference map (Figure 3(a)). O C C A representative density of the averaged electron density map (2FMU À FMU)exp(iaMU) is shown in O C C Figure 3(b). The three-dimensional structure of

Thermal inactivation and conformational stability To study enzyme inactivation at high temperatures, the wild-type GDH and the three mutants N97D, G376 K and N97D/G376 K GDHs were incubated at 85 C and the remaining activity was determined (Table 3). The wild-type GDH is signi®cantly more resistant against thermal inactivation than any of the three mutant GDHs, that showed two to threefold reduced half-lifes of inactivation.

The orientation of the secondary structure elements is similar to that in Figure 1. The green-coloured loop and # character indicate residues from an adjacent subunit. The Figure has been generated with the programme MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and the rendering programme Raster3D (Bacon & Anderson, 1988; Merrit & Murphy, 1994).

Melting temperatures of wild-type and the three mutant GDHs have been determined using differential scanning calorimetry (Table 3). Since the thermal unfolding transition was irreversible for all enzymes, unfolding enthalpies were not determined. No signi®cant differences in melting temperatures were found between the wild-type GDH and any of the three mutant GDHs. To obtain further information on the conformational stability against denaturation, unfolding of wild-type and mutant GDHs by increasing amounts of guanidinium chloride was assayed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Identical

transition midpoints were found for the wild-type and the three mutant GDHs (Table 3). Optimum temperature and kinetic parameters Optimum temperatures were determined by measuring enzyme activity at increasing temperatures (Figure 4). The activities of wild-type and N97D GDH showed comparable temperature dependencies, with optima around 65 C. Remarkably, the increase in activity which was found between 20 and 40 C, levelled off at higher temperatures, resulting in a ``bulge'' in the curves around 40 C. This behaviour was not found with

the other two mutant GDHs. Above 65 C, G376 K and N97D/G376 K showed similar speci®c activities to the wild-type and N97D GDH. However, below this temperature both these mutants were much more active. At 58 C, the difference between the double mutant and N97D is almost twofold (89 units/mg versus 51 units/mg, respectively). Independently cultured and puri®ed batches of wildtype and double mutant GDHs in all cases showed this higher speci®c activity for the double mutant. Enzyme inactivation started at 58 C for G376 K and N97D/G376 K, at 62 C for the wild-type GDH and at 66 C for N97D. Kinetic parameters were determined in order to study whether the differences in speci®c activities are caused by differences in apparent substrate af®nities (Table 4). For a-ketoglutarate, similar Km values were found for all the enzymes at 25 C. With increasing temperature this af®nity increased for the wild-type and N97D but remained unchanged for G376 K and N97D/G376 K. Km values for ammonia increased at higher temperature. Interestingly, G376 K and N97D/G376 K GDH appeared to have much lower Km values for ammonia at 25 C than the wild-type and N97D, but higher Km values at their temperature optimum. At 25 C the wild-type GDH had the lowest Km for NADH, followed by N97D, while G376 K and the double mutant showed the highest Km. At 58 C, Km values were lower than at 25 C, which contrasts with the results found for ammonia. Remarkably, for N97D GDH the decrease is almost ten-fold.

Discussion
In order to study the role of a ®ve-residue ionpair network in the hinge region of P. furiosus GDH, the participating charged residues were introduced into the less stable GDH from T. maritima. Elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the double mutant N97D/G376 K showed that the designed ion-pair interactions are indeed formed and, moreover, because of an additional charged residue present in T. maritima GDH, a sixresidue ion-pair network was found to be formed. Detailed analysis showed that the con®guration of the participating residues is similar to those in the P. furiosus structure and that, apart from the extra ion-pair, no additional interactions are formed. The environment of the network is very well conserved in both enzymes and there is only one conservative valine to isoleucine substitution in the immediate vicinity of the participating residues. Due to the Ê resolution limit of 3.0 A in the T. maritima GDH structures, interactions with surrounding water molecules could not be considered. Using differential scanning calorimetry and guanidinium chloride-induced unfolding, we did not observe an increase in melting temperature or a shift of the

denaturation midpoint towards higher guanidinium chloride concentrations of the mutant GDHs. Thermal inactivation of the enzymes was affected; all enzymes withstand incubation at 85 C for a considerable period of time but the wild-type shows at least a twofold longer half-life. The faster inactivation caused by the two single mutations is not additive since the half-life of the double mutant is similar to that of either of the single mutants. This might be due to a favourable ionic and/or H-bond interaction between the two introduced side-chains. For mutant N97D the faster inactivation cannot be explained by the loss of a hydrogen bridge due to the removal of the amine group; rather, in addition to the introduction of ionic interactions, a hydrogen bridge was gained in the mutant because of the presence of two hydrogen acceptors in the aspartate side-chain that can now interact with the neighbouring amine groups from lysine 376 and arginine 64. In all mutants all participating residues are surface-exposed and new residues are not introduced into a hydrophobic environment. Less obvious reasons, for example unfavourable interactions with the existing electrostatic potential, must play a role. In conclusion, no signi®cant stabilizing effect of the introduced ionpair network could be detected. It is interesting to note that the Km values of the T. maritima GDH for NADH and a-ketoglutarate decreased with increasing temperature, suggesting that substrate/cofactor binding has been adapted to the high growth temperature of the organism (80 C). However, for ammonia the opposite effect was observed, to the extent that there is not even an increase in catalytic ef®ciency at the higher temperature. In comparison with the wild-type GDH, the different mutant enzymes showed lower af®nity for NADH and higher af®nity for ammonia at

25 C but lower af®nity for the latter substrate at 58 C. The changes of these values with temperature were different for each enzyme. Enzymes need to compromise between a certain stability (or rigidity) in order to maintain the native conformation, and conformational ¯exibility in order to function. It is anticipated that the modulation of ¯exibility is substantially affected by interactions between regions of the enzyme where major conformational changes occur during catalysis, such as the hinge region in GDH. Sequence variations in these areas may account for the optimization of enzyme catalysis at the growth temperature of a certain organism. This idea is enforced by the observation that many of the sequence variations between the 90% identical GDHs from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus litoralis (optimum growth t  88 C; Neuner et al., 1990) and P. furiosus (optimum growth t  100 C; Fiala & Stetter, 1986) are located in the hinge region (Britton et al., 1995). Mutants G376 K and N97D/G376 K have signi®cantly higher speci®c activities at moderate temperatures (between 40 and 60 C) than the wild-type GDH and N97D, with an almost twofold difference between N97D and the double mutant at 58 C. Substitution G376 K seems to be responsible for this effect. Glycine is the amino acid which imposes the least conformational strain on a peptide chain. It has been a well-established idea that enzymes from hyperthermophiles are less ¯exible at room temperature than their less stable homologues, and gain comparable ¯exibility and maximum catalytic activity around the optimum growth temperature of the organisms in which they reside. The glycine to lysine substitution might result in a GDH that is less ¯exible in the hinge region and might have its optimum activity

294 shifted to a higher temperature. However, the two GDHs containing the G376 K substitution display higher speci®c activities at lower temperatures than the wild-type GDH. Above 65 C the speci®c activities of the mutant enzymes do not differ signi®cantly from that of the wild-type enzyme. In conclusion, our results indicate that large ionpair networks which have been reported for several hyperthermostable enzymes may play an important role in the adaptation of their speci®c activity and temperature optima. A role in conferring stability could not be demonstrated, and considering the complexity of these multi-subunit enzymes, higher amino acid identity and structural homology might be required in order to obtain con®rmation of these results. This is the ®rst experimental report on the effect of large ion-pair networks on protein stability and activity and may contribute to a further understanding of these characteristic features of hyperthermostable enzymes.

T. maritima Glutamate Dehydrogenase Hinge Mutants Data collection, analysis and refinement Data were collected as described for the wild-type GDH (Knapp et al., 1997). Since the double mutant was identical to the wild-type GDH in cell parameters and spacegroup, its structure was directly re®ned with the È program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) using the phases determined for the wild-type structure (Knapp et al., 1997) and parameters developed by Engh & Huber (1991). 10% of all re¯ections were excluded from the re®nement to calculate a free R-factor. All temperature factors were Ê initially set to 20 A2. Initially a rigid body re®nement was carried out using (1) the hexamer, (2) the subunits and (3) the domains as rigid bodies. After the rigid body re®nement the R-value dropped from 34% (Rfree  35%) to 31% (Rfree 32%). In the calculated electron density ((2FMu À FWT) exp iaWT) as well as in the difference map O C C ((FMu À FWT) exp iaWT) the introduced lysine residue at O C C position 376 was clearly visible. The density was improved by 6-fold averaging using the program MAIN (Turk, 1992). No density in the difference map but a clear density in the (2FMu À FWT) exp iaWT map was visO C C ible at position 97 where an asparagine residue was replaced by an aspartate. The new side-chains were built into the density and the mutant structure was subsequently re®ned using strict non-crystallographic symmetry and grouped temperature factors. Here the conventional R-value dropped to 27% (Rfree 31%). Finally the positions of the atoms were restrained with an effecÊ tive energy term of 300 kcal/(mol A2) and in the last re®nement cycles the restraints were weakened for the amino acid side-chains as well as for the crystal-contact regions. The ®nal model was re®ned to a similar R-value as the wild-type structure (R-value  22.5%, Rfree 29.8%). The coordinates will be submitted to the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, and are available from the authors on request until processed and released. Characterization of wild-type and mutant GDHs GDH activity was assayed using a Cary 4E or Beckman DU7500 spectrophotometer at 340 nm and 25 C. The 1.0 ml standard assay reaction mixtures (reductive amination) contained 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) and 10 mM a-ketoglutarate, 500 mM ammonia and 200 mM NADH. Corrections were made for the increasing auto-oxidation of NADH at elevated temperatures. The amount of enzyme was adjusted to obtain a rate of about 0.03 ÁA340 nm/minute. One unit of enzyme activity is de®ned as the amount of enzyme which converts 1 mmol NADH per minute under standard conditions. At 25 C NADH was not saturating at concentrations as high as 310 mM. The data could, however, be accurately ®tted according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics and the curve showed clear levelling off at higher concentrations. At 58 C, saturation was reached at 280 mM NADH in the case of the wild-type enzyme and N97D. For G376 K and the double mutant, saturation was almost complete at this temperature. Using NADPH instead of NADH resulted in immediate decrease of initial activity in the assay under all conditions used, and suggested product inhibition by NADP. This ®nding was con®rmed by addition of a pulse of 5 mM NADP to a running NADH reaction which immediately abolished all activity. Thermal inactivation was studied at an enzyme concentration of 50 mg/ml and 85 C. Residual enzyme activity was assayed at 25 C as described above. Guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation was studied as described before (Lebbink et al.,

Materials and Methods
Construction of expression plasmids for wild-type and mutated gdh genes Wild-type T. maritima GDH was expressed in E. coli TG1 (Gibson, 1984) from a 1.7 kb fragment, containing the T. maritima gdh gene (Kort et al., 1997), cloned into a pTZ19R-derivative (Mead et al., 1986). Due to a spontaneous mutation during subcloning, the gene product differs from the enzyme described by Kort et al. (1997) at position 152 at which a methionine instead of an isoleucine is present. This methionine at position 152 is partially exposed, located at the bottom of the substrate binding domain where no important interactions are formed and is present in all investigated GDHs, including the wild-type enzyme. Because the substitution does not lead to any conformational change, it is not taken into consideration. To facilitate further manipulations, a BamHI restriction site was introduced at position 542 of the coding region by PCR without changing the amino acid sequence. The single mutations leading to amino acid substitutions N97D and G376 K were introduced using cassette mutagenesis and the megaprime method (Landt et al., 1990; Kuipers et al., 1991) and were combined by the exchange of restriction fragments. DNA sequencing was performed to verify the sequence of the ampli®ed DNA and to con®rm the presence of the desired mutations.

Purification and crystallization of GDH Wild-type and mutant GDH was puri®ed from overnight cultures as described before (Knapp et al., 1997). Protein concentrations were determined using an extinction coef®cient at 280 nm of em  46,490 MÀ1 cmÀ1 calculated as described by Gill & von Hippel (1989). Crystals of mutant N97D/G376 K were grown as described for the wild-type GDH (Knapp et al., 1997) using slightly higher concentrations of polyethylene glycol (4 to 6%, w/v).

Differential scanning microcalorimetry was carried out on a MicroCal MCS calorimeter controlled by the MCS OBSERVER program. Protein samples (1 mg/ ml) were dialysed extensively against 30 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and degassed for ®ve minutes. Samples were heated at a rate of 1 deg.C/minute.
