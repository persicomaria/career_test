Abstract Synechocystis hemoglobin contains an unprecedented covalent bond between a nonaxial histidine side chain (H117) and the heme 2-vinyl. This bond has been previously shown to stabilize the ferric protein against denaturation, and also to affect the kinetics of cyanide association. However, it is unclear why Synechocystis hemoglobin would require the additional degree of stabilization accompanying the His117­heme 2-vinyl bond because it also displays endogenous bis-histidyl axial heme coordination, which should greatly assist heme retention. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the His117­heme 2-vinyl bond affects ligand binding has not been reported, nor has any investigation of the role of this bond on the structure and function of the protein in the ferrous oxidation state. Here we report an investigation of the role of the Synechocystis hemoglobin His117­heme 2-vinyl bond on structure, heme coordination, exogenous ligand binding, and stability in both the ferrous and ferric oxidation states. Our results reveal that hexacoordinate Synechocystis hemoglobin lacking this bond is less stable in the ferrous oxidation state than the ferric, which is surprising in light of our understanding of pentacoordinate Hb stability, in which the ferric protein is always less stable. It is also demonstrated that removal of the His117­heme 2-vinyl bond increases the affinity constant for intramolecular histidine coordination in the ferric oxidation state, thus presenting greater competition for the ligand binding site and lowering the observed rate and affinity constants for exogenous ligands.

The past few decades have revealed that hemoglobins are found not only in vertebrates, but also in archaea, bacteria, animals, and plants (Weber and Vinogradov 2001; Wittenberg et al. 2002; Kundu et al. 2003b; Wu et al. 2003). A common function of vertebrate Hb is to transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues through the

vascular system. However, Hbs have many other potential functions including ligand scavenging, detoxification, small molecule sensing, signal transduction, and gene regulation (Appleby 1984; Minning et al. 1999; Burr et al. 2000; Hou et al. 2000; Poole and Hughes 2000; Wittenberg et al. 2002; Hankeln et al. 2005), while the functions of many Hbs remain to be identified. A number of newly discovered Hbs display unorthodox structural characteristics. Plants, animals, and some bacteria have Hbs that carry out reversible intramolecular coordination of the heme iron by a ``distal'' histidine side chain (Burmester et al. 2000; Trent et al. 2001b; Weber and Vinogradov 2001; Burmester et al. 2002; Trent and Hargrove 2002; Wittenberg et al. 2002; Kundu et al. 2003b; Wu et al. 2003). These ``hexacoordinate'' Hbs (hxHbs) are likely the scaffold from which oxygen

transport Hbs evolved in plants and animals (Vinogradov et al. 2006). The ``proximal'' histidine is tightly coordinated to the heme iron (as in oxygen transport Hbs), but the distal histidine reversibly coordinates the ligand binding site and competes with the binding of exogenous ligands like oxygen and nitric oxide. Recent studies in plant and animal systems have described structural components that regulate affinity constants for distal histidine binding, showing that the strength of histidine coordination greatly affects affinity and kinetic constants for exogenous ligand binding (Smagghe et al. 2006a,b). Another nontraditional group of Hbs, the ``truncated'' Hbs (trHbs), is found in eubacteria, bacteria, single-celled eukaryotes, and plants (Couture et al. 2000; Scott and Lecomte 2000; Hvitved et al. 2001; Watts et al. 2001; Wittenberg et al. 2002). They can be 20­40 residues shorter than the majority of Hbs and comprise an abbreviated globin architecture surrounding the heme that forms a ``2-on-2'' fold (Pesce et al. 2000; Wittenberg et al. 2002). Cyanobacteria contain a trHb that is unique even within this family. The Hb from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (SynHb) is hexacoordinate, truncated, and bears an unprecedented covalent bond between the non-axial His117 and a heme porphyrin vinyl group (Vu et al. 2002). Extensive research has investigated the role of this covalent heme­protein link since its 2002 discovery (Vu et al. 2002). Prior to identification of this bond, the existence of two forms of the protein had been noted, and experiments were carefully performed only on the form of the protein that, in retrospect, lacked the covalent bond (Lecomte et al. 2001). These experiments included observation of slow heme release (Scott and Lecomte 2000; Lecomte et al. 2001), thermal denaturation (Lecomte et al. 2001), and measurement of the electrochemical midpoint potential (Lecomte et al. 2001). After the covalent bond was discovered as the source of heterogeneity, partial NMR structural analysis indicated little global conformational change among the ferric tertiary structures of the two forms of wild-type protein and the H117A mutant protein (which is incapable of forming the covalent bond) (Falzone et al. 2002; Vu et al. 2004a, 2004b). Thermal and acid denaturation studies of the ferric forms of these three proteins found the wildtype protein with the covalent bond to be more stable than the mutant or wild-type lacking the bond (Lecomte et al. 2001; Vu et al. 2004a,b). Finally, cyanide binding to the ferric form of the H117A mutant was found to be decreased compared to wild-type protein with an undetermined covalent bond contribution (Vu et al. 2004a). The above studies suggested that the His117­heme vinyl bond does not affect the overall conformation of the ferric protein, but does affect protein stability, heme affinity, and the ability of SynHb to bind exogenous ligands in the ferric oxidation state. The most plausible

explanation for the lowered cyanide affinity seen in the mutant lacking the covalent bond is increased competition for the binding site due to an increase in the equilibrium constant for distal histidine coordination to the ferric heme iron. Since heme affinity (and thus protein stability) would increase with this tighter heme coordination, it is odd that the His117­heme vinyl bond would be necessary to stabilize the protein in the ferric oxidation state. Furthermore, small molecule model-heme studies affirm that bis-histidyl heme coordination may be tighter in the ferric than the ferrous oxidation state (Nesset et al. 1996; Safo et al. 1997). If this chemical principle holds true in SynHb, the protein should be more susceptible to heme loss and subsequent unfolding in the ferrous oxidation state compared to the ferric. Consequently, the largest effects of removal of the His117­heme vinyl covalent bond might be exposed in the ferrous protein, a factor not investigated previously. Here we demonstrate that removal of the His117­heme vinyl covalent bond in SynHb affects distal histidine coordination of the heme iron by facilitating hexacoordination in the ferric oxidation state by a factor of ;10 compared to the wild-type protein. This is the root of the slower binding kinetics for ferric ligands in SynH117A, and also results in lowered equilibrium affinity constants for azide and cyanide. Surprisingly, the effects of the H117A mutation on protein stability and heme affinity are much more pronounced in the ferrous oxidation state compared to the ferric. This extraordinary observation is counter to our understanding of heme affinity in pentacoordinate hemoglobins (Hargrove and Olson 1996), but is consistent with studies of coordination affinity in bis-histidyl model heme compounds. Finally, crystal structures of wild-type and H117A SynHb affirm that the effects of this covalent bond on protein chemistry are not obvious in protein structure in either the ferric or ferrous oxidation sates. Results Crystal structures of ferric and ferrous SynHb and SynH117A Figure 1 presents an overlay of the crystal structures of SynHb (with the covalent bond) and SynH117A in both ferric and ferrous oxidation states. The backbone superposition of the ferric structures in Figure 1A shows ° minimal backbone deviation (RMSD ¼ 0.45 A), but small changes in the orientation of the heme and axial histidines, in agreement with the partial structural observations obtained by NMR (Vu et al. 2004b).

Therefore, the His117­heme vinyl bond has minimal effects on overall structure compared to the wild-type protein in both the ferric and ferrous oxidation states. However, the H117A mutation and the consequent movement of the H-helix opens space on the proximal side of the heme that allows solvent entry into heme pocket from the protein surface in both oxidation states (Fig. 1E,F). A closer examination of the changes in heme stereochemistry is summarized in the supplemental materials. It appears that there are no obvious structural differences between wild252

Here, H, P, and L refer to Hb in the hexacoordinate, pentacoordinate, and ligand bound states, respectively. The rate constants kÀH and kH are the dissociation and association rates for the distal histidine, while k9L[L] and kL are the ligand bimolecular association and dissociation rate constants. Flash photolysis was used to measure the CO bimolecular association rate constant of the SynH117A mutant protein for comparison to that published previously for wild-type SynHb (Hvitved et al. 2001; Smagghe et al. 2006b); this value, k9CO ¼ 150 mMÀ1secÀ1, is only slightly greater than that of the wild-type protein (see Table 1 for values and supplemental data for more information). The influence of intramolecular histidine coordination becomes apparent when comparing kinetic experiments initiated by flash photolysis to those measured by rapid mixing (Smagghe et al. 2006b). Figure 2A shows time courses for SynH117A binding with CO following rapid mixing. These data are consistent with those of wild-type SynHb in that the total expected amplitude is observed for the reaction at each [CO], and the observed rate constant increases with [CO] (Smagghe et al. 2006b). This indicates that k9CO > kÀH2 and kH2 (where kÀH2 and kH2 are the dissociation and association constants for the distal histidine in the ferrous state), and that the fraction of hexacoordinate Hb is near 1. Both of these observations are consistent with wild-type ferrous SynHb (Smagghe et al. 2006b). The [CO] dependence of the observed rate constants (from rapid mixing) in Figure 2A is plotted in Figure 2B.

Values for wild-type SynHb are taken from Smagghe et al. (2006b).

The asymptote approached in this curve is kÀH2, and a fit to Equation 1 provides kH2 (Hargrove 2000). These values are reported in Table 1, and reflect only modest (approximately threefold) increases for each in the mutant protein. Since both kH2 and kÀH2 increase to approximately the same degree in the mutant compared to the wild-type protein, the resulting values of KH2 (the association equilibrium constant for the distal histidine, equivalent to kH/kÀH) are nearly the same for each. These results demonstrate that the His117­heme vinyl bond has only minor effects on hexacoordination and exogenous ligand binding in ferrous SynHb. Spectroelectrochemistry Electrochemistry can be used to measure changes that occur in the strength of hexacoordination upon change in oxidation state (Halder et al. 2006; Smagghe et al. 2006b). In hexacoordinate Hbs, a shift to more-negative reduction potentials (compared to pentacoordinate Hbs) reveals that intramolecular histidine coordination of the heme iron is tighter in the ferric compared to the ferrous oxidation state (Dewilde et al. 2001; Halder et al. 2006; Smagghe et al. 2006b). Since previous work reported the midpoint reduction potential for only the wild-type protein without the covalent bond (Lecomte et al. 2001), we examined the midpoint potential for SynHb with the covalent bond and the SynH117A protein to determine if the His117­heme vinyl bond influences hexacoordination differentially in the ferric versus the ferrous oxidation state. The fraction of reduced protein for both SynHb and the H117A mutant protein as a function of the observed cell potential are shown in Figure 3A. The midpoint potential value (given in Table 1) is vastly lower for SynH117A (À280 mV) than for SynHb (À195 mV). The relationship between the equilibrium constant for hexacoordination (KH) in the ferric (H3) and ferrous (H2) forms and the midpoint reduction potential (Emid) for the pentacoordinate (pent) and hexacoordinate (hex) forms is given by Equation 2 (Halder et al. 2006).     nF ðEmid;hex ÀEmid;pent Þ À 1 + K H3 RT (2) = e 1 + K H2 If we assume that the difference in midpoint potentials between the wild-type and H117A proteins is due only to

histidine coordination (that is, Emid,pent is the same in both proteins), an estimate of the effect of the covalent bond on hexacoordination (KH3/KH2) can be calculated by Equation 3, which is derived by division of Equation 2 for the wildtype protein by that for SynH117A (Halder et al. 2006).     1 + K H3;SynH117A nF ðEmid;SynH117A ÀEmid;SynHb Þ À 1 + K H2;SynH117A RT   = e (3)

This equation correlates the effects of hexacoordination in each oxidation state with the observed reduction potential in each protein. An increased value of KH3/ KH2 is predicted for the mutant based on the large negative shift in reduction potential observed in Figure 3A. In fact, using the measured values given in Table 1 to calculate the right-hand side of Equation 3 gives a value of 27, affirming the increase in ferric hexacoordination upon removal of the covalent bond.

k9CN,pent) along with the effect of hexacoordination under conditions of prior equilibrium (this assumes that k9CN[CN] << kÀH3 and kH3) (Espenson 2002). Kinetic and equilibrium constants for azide and cyanide binding were measured for the H117A and wild-type proteins (Fig. 3B,C). The observed rate constants for cyanide association are linear and very slow, indicating that the bimolecular rate constant for the reaction with the pentacoordinate form of the Hb (k9CN) is << kH3 and kÀH3, as required in the equations above (Smagghe et al. 2006b). A linear fit to these data provides kCN,obs for each protein showing that the value for SynH117A is reduced ;10-fold compared to the wildtype protein (Table 1), which is consistent with the value reported previously (Vu et al. 2004a). This is accompanied by a proportionate decrease in the association equilibrium constant (KCN,obs) for cyanide. Likewise, the wild-type protein binds azide (albeit with a much smaller KN3,obs than for cyanide), but the mutant protein displayed no binding until concentrations higher than 4 M azide (data not shown). GdmCl unfolding The foremost hypothesis for the role of the His117­heme vinyl bond is stabilization of the protein through heme retention. Vu et al. (2004a) showed that, in fact, the ferric protein is less stable without the covalent bond. However, while there is reason to believe that hxHbs might be even less stable in the ferrous oxidation state than the ferric (Nesset et al. 1996; Safo et al. 1997), ferrous protein stability has not been examined. Therefore, we have measured GdmCl-induced unfolding of these proteins in both oxidation states. These experiments are shown in Figures 4 and 5, with unfolding midpoints, DGO, and m values listed in Table 2. Figure 4A provides a control with pentacoordinate horse heart Mb (hhMb), demonstrating that the ferrous protein is more stable than the ferric; mainly due to the tighter heme­proximal histidine bond in the ferrous protein (Hargrove et al. 1996a,b; Hargrove and Olson 1996). GdmCl unfolding of Mb yields free heme and unfolded apoglobin (Hargrove and Olson 1996; Tang et al. 1998), evident from the absorbance spectra for ferrous and ferric hhMb at 5 M GdmCl (Fig. 5A,B). Wild-type SynHb, on the other hand, is equally stable in either oxidation state (Fig. 4B); in fact, the spectral transition associated with GdmCl titration of wildtype SynHb does not yield free heme, but rather pentacoordinate complexes in both oxidation states (Fig. 5C,D). This is most obvious in the ferrous oxidation state (Fig. 5D, inset), in which the spectrum in 7 M GdmCl is a single broad absorbance band at 550 nm, characteristic of a ferrous pentacoordinate heme complex (Arredondo-Peter et al. 1997; Smagghe et al. 2006b). The results for the SynH117A mutant protein are quite surprising (Fig. 4C). This protein is less stable in both oxidation states compared with wild type SynHb, but

Ferric ligand binding The increase in KH3/KH2 predicted above can be tested using equilibrium and kinetic ligand binding experiments. The effect of a change in KH3 on these rate constants has been described previously in other systems (Trent et al. 2001b; Smagghe et al. 2006b), and the equations are shown here for cyanide serving as the ligand.

demonstrating that this protein loses heme at a rate of ;0.007 hÀ1 at pH 7.0. Previous work demonstrated very slow heme loss from ferric wild-type SynHb without the covalent bond (Scott and Lecomte 2000; Lecomte et al. 2001). Figure 6 shows heme dissociation experiments for SynHb (containing the covalent bond) and the SynH117A mutant protein in both the ferrous and ferric oxidation states. In each case, absorbance spectra are shown just after mixing with apoH64Y/V68F Mb and 2000 min after mixing. For the wild-type protein in both oxidation states, and for the ferric SynH117A mutant protein, no appreciable heme transfer is observed (Fig. 6 A­C). However, the ferrous SynH117A mutant protein loses heme at a rate of 0.012 minÀ1, ;100-times faster than ferric sperm whale myoglobin under the same conditions (Fig. 6D,E). Thus, the ferrous form of the protein is susceptible to heme loss, and therefore loss of function, without the added protection of the covalent bond. Discussion Interest in hemoglobin stability originated with efforts to understand hemoglobin pathologies that resulted in heme release and protein degradation. Thus, the vast majority of research in hemoglobin stability has focused on myoglobin and red blood cell hemoglobin, which are pentacoordinate with only the proximal His coordinating the heme iron. The earliest studies linked heme release with the ferric oxidation state, which led to the view that the ferrous­His bond is much stronger (Banerjee 1962; Bunn and Jandl 1968). Later work established that contributions to stability comprise globin folding and heme affinity in a relatively complex, interdependent relationship between the strength of the coordinate bond, hydrophobic interactions between the globin and the porphyrin, and solvent exclusion from the heme pocket (Hargrove et al. 1994a, 1996a,b; Hargrove and Olson 1996; Tang et al. 1998). Stability and heme affinity in hexacoordinate hemoglobins is not yet understood at this level, though a logical extension from work with Mb would suggest that having two coordinate His-heme iron bonds would further stabilize bound heme and foster protein stability. It is therefore surprising that heme retention in hexacoordinate SynHb would require additional support from the His117­ heme vinyl bond. The present results indicate that this bond is necessitated by lowered heme affinity in the ferrous oxidation state; this is counterintuitive to the situation with pentacoordinate Hbs, where it is the ferric oxidation state that has a lower affinity for heme. Possible reasons for this fundamental difference between SynHb and pentacoordinate Hbs, along with the consequences of this unusual covalent bond on ligand binding are discussed below.

unlike pentacoordinate hhMb, is most unstable in the ferrous oxidation state. Furthermore, the final absorbance spectra at high [GdmCl] are nearly identical to those of hhMb, indicating that heme is dissociating from this protein that lacks the His117­heme vinyl bond (Fig. 5E,F). This suggests that the His117­heme vinyl covalent bond is the dominant contributor to heme affinity compared to the axial His-heme coordinate bonds. Heme dissociation If heme affinity is the principal factor affecting protein stability, it should be possible to directly measure its dissociation. This is the case for ferric (but not ferrous) Mb, in which transfer to the heme-scavenger protein (apoH64Y/V68F Mb) has been used to measure rate constants for heme dissociation (Hargrove et al. 1996b),

Panels E and F also contain the high [GdmCl] spectra (dotted lines) from the hhMb graphs of A and B for comparison.

The role of the His117­heme vinyl bond in protein stability The His117­heme vinyl bond is the dominant force holding heme in SynHb in both the ferrous and ferric oxidation states. This conclusion is most evident from the fact that even when the wild-type protein unfolds (presumably leading to the pentacoordinate spectral transition in Fig. 5C,D), the heme is retained. But if the covalent bond is broken, heme dissociation accompanies unfolding, which occurs under much milder conditions (Fig. 5E,F). The cause of the decrease in stability in the absence of the His117­ heme vinyl bond could have both enthalpic and entropic origins. The loss of hydrophobic clustering in the heme pocket upon heme dissociation could lower the enthalpy of the folded state, and heme dissociation upon unfolding could increase the entropy of the unfolded state. However, the experiments presented here do not distinguish between these contributions. Vu et al. (2004b) report that decoordination of both axial histidines accompanies protein unfolding in both ferric wt SynHb forms (with and without the covalent bond) due to the presence of isosbestic points in the spectral transitions. However, their ferric, unfolded spec256

tra are similar to those reported here, including the difference seen with and without the covalent bond. The similarity of the spectrum lacking the covalent bond to that of unfolded hhMb, in which it has been demonstrated that heme is dissociated, supports heme dissociation in SynHb lacking the covalent bond. The spectra of unfolded SynHb containing the covalent bond, however, does not look like that of hhMb, suggesting that heme is retained. Furthermore, the presence of isosbestic points does not imply any particular final coordination state, but only suggests a two-state transition. However, differences in

crystal structures of the mutant protein in both oxidation states (Fig. 1E,F). Effects of the His117­heme vinyl bond on hexacoordination and exogenous ligand binding While the details of the effects of the His117­heme vinyl bond on protein stability were surprising, a role related to heme affinity was not unanticipated. A more curious result is the effect of the covalent bond on ligand binding. We have shown here that removal of this bond is felt more acutely on the ferric heme than the ferrous due to a higher affinity constant for hexacoordination in the ferric oxidation state. The ferrous hexacoordination equilibrium constant (KH2) is only approximately threefold larger in the H117A mutant protein, mainly due to an increase in the rate constant for His coordination (kH2) (Table 1). A much larger effect is observed on the redox potential, which drops by 85 mV in the H117A protein compared to wild-type SynHb. A shift of this magnitude suggests the possibility of much tighter hexacoordination in the ferric oxidation state (KH3); specifically, a 27-fold higher ratio of KH3/KH2 compared to wild-type SynHb. In fact, this 27-fold increase in KH3/KH2 combined with the threefold increase in KH2 for SynH117A predicts that KH3 for the mutant should be ;80-times greater than that of SynHb according to Equation 3. The effect on KH3 can also be evaluated by measuring rate and affinity constants for exogenous ligand binding in the ferric oxidation state. The influence of KH3 on these reactions is described by Equations 4 and 5, respectively. In each case, the observed binding constant is reduced by a factor ;KH3. Therefore, KH3,H117A/KH3,SynHb should equal the ratio of kCN,obs,SynHb/kCN,obs,H117A, which should also be equal to KCN,obs,SynHb/KCN,obs,H117A. In fact, these values (14 and 10, respectively) are quite similar, and their correspondence supports assignment of this value to the increase in KH3 associated with breaking the His117­ heme vinyl bond in SynHb. However, these values are much lower than the value of 80 predicted by Equation 3, suggesting that the shift in redox potential for SynH117A compared to the wild-type protein derives from factors other than just effects of the covalent bond on axial histidine heme coordination. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that the redox potential for wild-type SynHb in which the protein is produced without the His117­heme vinyl bond is À150 mV (Lecomte et al. 2001), 45 mV higher than when this bond is present (Table 1), suggesting that the H117A mutation has additional effects beyond simply preventing this covalent bond. These effects might include movement of the H-helix (Fig. 1B,D), and the resulting increase in solvent accessibility to the proximal heme pocket (Fig. 1E,F).

Figure 6. Heme transfer to H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin. Optical spectra initially (lines) and after 2000 min (dotted lines) for ferric SynHb (A), ferrous SynHb (B), ferric SynH117A (C), and ferrous SynH117A (D) reveal heme loss only for ferrous SynH117A (E).

unfolded states could also result from the different methods of denaturation used in these two reports. The most surprising discovery from the experiments illustrated in Figures 4, 5, and 6 is that, in the absence of the His117­heme vinyl bond, the ferrous hexacoordinate complex is significantly less stable than the ferric. This suggests the possibility that the influence of oxidation state on heme affinity in hexacoordinate Hbs is opposite to that in pentacoordinate Hbs like Mb, at least in the case of SynHb. Coordination studies of model heme compounds are consistent with the behavior of SynHb. Coordination of the heme iron is stronger in the ferric form than the ferrous due to the associated change in spin state of the iron upon binding of the second ligand (Nesset et al. 1996; Safo et al. 1997). These results raise questions about the chemical nature of Hb stability in pentacoordinate versus hexacoordinate hemoglobins. Belief that the ferrous heme­His bond is stronger in Mb originated with the observation that heme transfer does not occur in this oxidation state (Hargrove et al. 1994a, 1996a,b, 1997; Hargrove and Olson 1996). However, there is no obvious explanation for why the single ferrous His­heme bond is stronger than the ferric bond in pentacoordinate Hbs, or why the opposite might be the case in hxHbs. It will be important to investigate whether this phenomenon is specific to SynHb, or if it is also seen in larger hexacoordinate Hbs lacking a covalent bond between the porphyrin ring and globin. It is possible that the truncated nature of SynHb requires the His117­ heme vinyl bond in lieu of sufficient hydrophobic ``waterproofing'' of the proximal heme pocket (Liong et al. 2001). This hypothesis is consistent with the increase in solvation of the H117A proximal heme pocket seen in the

Hoy et al.

In conclusion, the His117­heme vinyl bond in SynHb is not required to achieve the global structural architecture of the wild-type protein in either the ferric or ferrous oxidation states, although minor structural perturbations do affect hexacoordination of the heme. Removal of the covalent linkage also affects exogenous ligand binding, particularly in the ferric oxidation state. The different kinetic and equilibrium constants exhibited by SynHb with and without this bond can both be explained by changes in the affinity constant for intramolecular distal His coordination for the ferric heme (KH3). Furthermore, the ferrous protein lacking this bond is much less stable against denaturation than the ferric, and both oxidation states differ from wild-type SynHb in that heme is lost during unfolding of the H117A mutant protein. In contrast, when this bond is present in SynHb, even very high concentrations of GdmCl (7M) do not dissociate the heme from the globin in either oxidation state. Therefore, this covalent bond is likely present to prevent heme dissociation from the ferrous hexacoordinate complex of SynHb. Materials and methods Protein expression and purification
The expression and purification methods used for SynHb (containing the covalent bond) and SynH117A have been described in detail (Hvitved et al. 2001; Trent et al. 2001a; Smagghe et al. 2006b). Briefly, both proteins were cloned into a pET-29a (Novagen) vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21CP (Invitrogen) for wt SynHb, and C41 (Avidis) for SynH117A. Following cell lysis, purification included ammonium sulphate fractionation, phenyl Sepharose hydrophobic exchange, DEAE Sepharose anion-exchange, and G-75 Sephadex size-exclusion chromatography. The purified protein was oxidized with an excess of potassium ferricyanide followed by desalting on a G-25 Sephadex column in 0.01 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The purity of the resulting ferric hemoglobin was found to have a Soret/A280 absorbance ratio >4.7. The wild-type SynHb protein purified and used in all experiments below contains the covalent bond (Hoy et al. 2004; Trent et al. 2004).

collection) was repeated on ferric crystals and no CO-bound Hb absorption spectrum was observed. An additional check on oxidation state is the observation that ferrous crystals shatter in the presence of CO while ferric crystals do not. Finally, sulfur dioxide molecules (the reducing agent arising from sodium dithionite) (Weiland et al. 2004) are seen in complex with the protein in the electron density of the reduced crystals (see supplemental materials for comparative solvent electron density demonstrating the presence of sulfur dioxide). Diffraction data for all three structures were collected on a Rigaku/MSC home source generator and solved by molecular replacement using the ferric SynHb structure as a model (1RTX.pdb). All three crystals were in space group P212121 with four monomers in the asymmetric unit. A table of data collection and refinement statistics for the datasets of ferrous SynHb, ferric SynH117A, and ferrous SynH117A is included in the supplemental materials. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org, PDB ID 2HZ1, 2HZ2, and 2HZ3 for ferrous SynHb, ferric SynH117A, and ferrous SynH117A, respectively). Figure 1 was created using the programs SPDBV (ExPASy), POV-Ray (Persistence ° of Vision Raytracer Pty. Ltd.), and SURFNET using a 1.4 A probe (Laskowski 1995; Guex and Peitsch 1997).

Carbon monoxide binding
Flash photolysis was used to measure bimolecular carbon monoxide association rate constants as described previously (Hargrove 2000). CO binding was measured by rapid mixing using a BioLogic SFM 400 stopped flow reactor coupled to a MOS 250 spectrophotometer. Experiments were conducted at 20°C in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), using the method of Smagghe et al. (2006b). Time courses were collected at different CO concentrations, with at least three kinetic traces collected and averaged for each CO concentration. Data analysis and figure generation for ligand binding experiments were performed with the software Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc.).

Spectroelectrochemistry
Potentiometric titrations were performed using the method of Altuve et al. (2004) as described in detail previously (Halder et al. 2006; Smagghe et al. 2006b). In brief, ferric Hbs (;30 mM) were titrated stepwise with a sodium dithionite solution (;40 mM) under anaerobic conditions. All reactions used saturated calomel (reference) and platinum (working) electrodes, and were carried out at 25°C in argon-saturated 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Reduction was monitored by recording absorbance spectrum in the visible region (500­700 nm), and the corresponding cell potential was noted for each addition of sodium dithionite after equilibrium was reached. All midpoint potentials are reported with respect to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Midpoint potentials were extracted from the change in absorbance by fitting to the following equation (Bogumil et al. 1994): eÀ ð
nF ðEobsÀEmid Þ RT

Structure determination
Crystals of ferric SynHb and SynH117A were grown as described previously (Hoy et al. 2004). Ferrous crystals were produced by reducing ferric crystals for 5 min in 10 mL of well buffer containing 100 mM sodium dithionite. Before mounting, the crystals were extensively washed in well buffer lacking sodium dithionite to remove excess reductant. To confirm that the crystal remained in the ferrous oxidation state during diffraction, the crystal was removed from the goniometer after data collection and immediately dissolved in 100 mL of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), equilibrated with CO. The presence of CO-bound Hb in this sample was observed spectrally with an Ocean-Optics USB2000 UV-VIS spectrophotometer, confirming that the crystal was still reduced, as ferric SynHb does not bind this ligand. As a control, this procedure (minus the initial treatment with dithionite prior to data

Cyanide binding kinetics
Time courses for cyanide binding were measured using a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Cyanide concentrations ranging from 0 M to 0.4 M were used, and each cyanide concentration was prepared using 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), in a separate cuvette before protein addition, and the reaction was monitored for up to 12 h. The change in Soret absorbance was plotted versus time and fitted to a single exponential to obtain kobs at each [CN]. The linear dependence of this value is the observed bimolecular (pseudo first-order) rate constant (k9CN).

linear dependence of DG on GdmCl concentration. The unfolding midpoint values were calculated by dividing DGO by m, and are in good correspondence to those estimated by visual inspection of the unfolding curves.

Heme loss assay
Rate constants for heme dissociation were measured using the H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin method described by Hargrove et al. (1994b). For experiments with ferrous Hbs, all cuvettes and solutions were purged with nitrogen and the reaction buffers contained 100 mM sodium dithionite. Spectral changes were monitored over the course of 2000 min. For ferric proteins, heme loss is accompanied by an increased absorbance at 600 nm. For ferrous proteins, heme loss shifts the Soret peak to 434 for MbH64Y/V68F. The change in absorbance at the Soret peak as a function of time was fit with a single exponential to extract the rate constant for heme loss.

Equilibrium ferric ligand binding
Since the kinetic schemes for ligand binding in hxHbs are complex, it is important to measure affinities using equilibrium methods as well (Kundu et al. 2003a). Equilibrium association constants for cyanide and azide were measured by equilibrium titration. For both experiments, the protein concentrations were ;7 mM (well below the respective KD values). The samples were allowed to sit for 30 min following mixing to ensure equilibrium. Absorbance spectra were measured during ligand binding, and the position of the Soret peak was monitored to calculate fractional saturation. The peak shifted from ;408/410 nm (for the unliganded ferric protein) to ;415/418 nm (for the ligand-bound species) for SynHb/SynH117A, and the inflection of the first derivative of each spectrum was used to find the peak maximum. Equilibrium binding curves were fit to the following equation to extract equilibrium association constants: ! ½L ½L lL + 1 À 1 l3+ 1 KCN;obs + ½L KCN;obs + ½L

Guanidinium chloride unfolding
Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) unfolding experiments were performed according to the method of Pace et al. (1990). A stock solution of 7.5 M GdmCl, 30 mM MOPS (pH 7.0) was used to prepare cuvettes varying in [GdmCl] from 0 to 5 M; 10 mM Hb was added to each cuvette. For ferrous experiments, all solutions contained 100 mM sodium dithionite and were purged with nitrogen. Samples were equilibrated for 1­2 h, then absorbance spectra were measured. Soret absorbance values were plotted as a function of GdmCl concentration, and the DGO and m values of the unfolding curves (Table 2) were determined according to a two-state model for denaturation (F4U) using Equation 8 (Pace et al. 1990; Hargrove et al. 1994a; Hargrove and Olson 1996; Mok et al. 1996).
