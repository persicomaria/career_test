Abstract The X-ray crystal structures of pyridino-(N ,N ?-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-ethylenediamine)zinc, bis-(N ,N ?-bis(salicylidene)-1,3-propanediamine zinc) and bis-((m-acetato-O ,O ?)-(N ,N ?-bis(salicylidene)-1,4-butanediamine) zinc) zinc are reported. These elusive motifs complete a structure based matrix of compounds for the late transition metals zinc with the popular ligands N,N ?-bis(salicylidene)1,2-ethylenediamine, N,N ?-bis(salicylidene)-1,3-propanediamine and N ,N ?-bis(salicylidene)-1,4-butanediamine. Coupled with the structural data from previously reported zinc complexes, it is possible to provide an in depth analysis of the behaviour of these three ligand systems within a five coordinate environment. The information is further combined with structural data on the homologous copper and nickel complexs to provide an overview of the conformational flexibility of these three ligands within a four, five or six coordinate environment. It is demonstrated that the more neglected N ,N ?-bis(salicylidene)-1,4-butanediamine motif may have great potential for supporting chemistry at a metal centre where significant changes in coordination number and geometry are desired. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1. Introduction We have recently developed an interest in the design and construction of chelating ligands, which remain ambivalent to the preferred coordination geometry of the metal centre [1]. The intention is to develop multidentate ligands, which support metal cations through chemical reactions involving extreme geometric changes. Unlike monodentate ligands, the desired fluxional, chelating ligands should allow us to maintain a limit on the number of vacant coordination sites available during geometrically active reactions. It is anticipated that there will be distinct advantages of this strategy in the areas of catalysis and sensors in more hostile media. For example, the potential exists for bulky, sterically incompatible substrates to coordinate in the trans positions, transiently migrate intramolecularly into cis positions where they can react. Consequently our initial

studies have been directed towards the identification of a simple, ligand framework, which can support all of the common geometries, displayed by first row transition metal cations (Fig. 1). We have began our search by exploring the structural preferences of a series of Schiff's base ligands; namely N ,N ?-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-ethylenediamine (Salen), N ,N ?-bis(salicylidene)-1,3-propane-diamine (Salpr) and N ,N ?-bis(salicylidene)-1,4-butanediamine (Salbu) as these allow us to introduce increasing degrees of flexibility into the ligand while maintaining close control over the other variables. For example, to avoid steric and electronic influences from substituent groups around the ligand, R1, R2 and R3 (Fig. 2) have initially been maintained in their simplest protic form. In our previous study on the structural preferences of nickel [1], we were able to demonstrate that Salbu behaves significantly different to Salen [2,3] and Salpr [1,4 Á/6]. For Salen and Salpr the ligands were found to be restricted to the equatorial plane of the metal centre by virtue of the diamine chelate ring size. Although Salpr forms larger chelate rings to that of Salen, the nickel structures obtained remain an accommodation of

Coupled with the structural preference of Salbu for octahedral geometries with nickel, it is also reported to support a planar four coordinate geometry [7] similar to Salen [2] and Salpr [4]. However, a more complete
The terms mer and fac , properly used, describe the positions of three identical ligands within an octahedral complex. This nomenclature is employed here to include the relative positions of the four donor atoms of these tetradentate Schiffs base ligands. Thus, mer is used to imply a ligand lying meridionally around the metal centre with the other ligands occupying the trans positions. Fac implies that the four donors occupy one face of the metal allowing the remaining ligands to lie cis to one another.

picture of the structure of these Salbu moieties within a four coordinate environment can be obtained by extending the remit to include the established structures of divalent copper [4,8 Á/12]. Here a definite trend from planar (Salen, Salpr) to a distorted tetrahedral environment (Salbu) was observed as the alkyl chain between the two imine moieties increases in length (Fig. 1). Thus it is clear that Salbu is also capable of adopting either a square-planar (nickel) or a tetrahedral (copper) motif at the behest of the metal centre. Thus, we have a complete picture of the chosen ligand system within a four and six coordinate environment (Figs. 1 and 3). Consequently, the missing element in the concept put forward is a clear understanding of the chosen ligand's behaviour in a five coordinate environment. Since Zinc demonstrates a marked preference for this geometry, its complexes with the ligand set have been identified as the third important structural motif (Fig. 1) for our initial studies. Although Schiff's base complexes of zinc have been known for many years [13 Á/ 15], surprising they still remain very poorly characterised structurally. In a comparable earlier study to that presented here Batley and Graddon [15] attempted to delineate the structural preferences of these complexes using spectroscopic methods. Their early study suggested that as the alkyl chain between the two imine moieties increases in length (n ]/3, Fig. 2) the complexes change structural preference from a five coordinate configuration (e.g. [Zn(salen)OH2] [16]) to a more complex polymeric form. However, more recently two structural reports on Zn(salpr) complexes have appeared [17,18] in which the zinc atom adopts a five coordinate environment. These recent conflicting studies suggest that the structural patterns available to zinc may be more complex and divergent than previously thought. Consequently, this study seeks to characterise the key parent zinc complexes derived from Salen, Salpr and Salbu such that the structural preferences of zinc can be clearly identified. Combining this information with that derived from the previous study [1] on nickel and copper should make it possible to generate a complete picture of the behaviour of the chosen ligands within a four, five and six coordinate environment.

2.3. Zn(Salbu) Zinc acetate dihydrate (0.44 g, 2.0 mmol) were dissolved in pyridine (25 ml). Salbu (0.59 g, 2.0 mmol) was added and the solution allowed to stir for 48 h. The mixture was treated with diethylether to produce a pale lemon yellow powder, which was recovered by filtration. Yield 0.3 g; 42%.

X-ray analysis All measurements were conducted with a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer at 123 K, using graphite monochromated Mo Ka radiation, on suitable crystals mounted on glass fibres. Details of the data collection and refinements are given in Table 1. The structures were solved by direct methods [21]. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. In all cases the refinement converged satisfactorily.

2.1. Zn(Salen) Zinc acetate dihydrate (0.44 g, 2.0 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (50 ml). Salen (0.54 g, 2.0 mmol) was added and the solution brought to reflux. The mixture was heated for 2 h during which time a lemon yellow precipitate formed. The solid was recovered from the hot liquor by filtration. Yield 0.5 g; 75%.

3. Results and discussion 2.2. Zn(Salpr) Zinc acetate dihydrate (0.44 g, 2.0 mmol) were dissolved in pyridine (25 ml). Salpr (0.56 g, 2.0 mmol) was added and the solution allowed to stir for 24 h during which time a very pale yellow precipitate formed. The solid was recovered by filtration and recrystalised from dichloromethaneÁ/diethylether by vapour diffusion. Yield 0.3 g; 43%. Expected for Zn(Salpr)×/0.5CH2Cl2 ×/C17.5H17O2N2Cl1Zn1: C, 54.15; H, 4.41; N, 7.22. Found: C, 54.45; H, 4.84; N, 7.15%. Similarly to many other workers the synthesis of zinc complexes of Salen, Salpr and Salbu was relatively straightforward to prepare. The complexes forthcoming from solution were essentially pure amorphous solids. Typically, however, their solubility remained poor and great difficulty was encountered in their re-crystallisation. Although Zn(Salen) could be re-crystallised from pyridine to form the desired five coordinate [Zn(Salen)NC5H5] complex, the corresponding Salpr and Salbu complexes refused to behave in a similar manner. Resorting to the synthesis of Salpr and Salbu in pyridine

in an attempt to force the donor solvent into the fifth coordination site still generated complexes devoid of pyridine (consistent with Batley et al. [15]). Curiously, however, the material derived from this reaction lead to the formation of a dichloromethane soluble [Zn(Salpr)] complex which could be crystallised and fully characterised. Once again, the Salbu species refused to mirror the behaviour of its lower homologue. However, as a consequence of our aggressive behaviour towards this material we were able to isolate suitable crystals of a minor product {[Zn(Salbu)]2(OAc)2Zn} which we were subsequently able to prepared by more rational means. Thus although we were capable of synthesising a series of five coordinate zinc complexes, the structural homology between them is somewhat more complex than initially anticipated. 3.1. [Zn(Salen)NC5H5] The structure obtained for [Zn(Salen)NC5H5] (Fig. 3) was the expected square based pyramidal configuration isostructrual with the monohydrate of Hall et al. [16]. In both compounds association occurs alternately between the bases of adjacent Salen units and the apical substituents (H2O, pyridine). However, unlike the monohydrate the distance between the co-planar pyridine rings (330 pm) in [Zn(Salen)NC5H5] support the view that the pyridine ligands are p-stacked in the bulk solid. For [Zn(Salen)NC5H5] the zinc sits within the body of the pyramid approximately 33 pm from the base as defined by the Salen ligand donor atoms. The Npy Ã/ Zn distance at 208.8 pm is commensurate with the nitrogen donors (208.7 pm) in the chelate. At the apex of the pyramid the pyridine ligand lies at an angle of 172.18

the pyridine is again reflected by the angles at the Npy Ã/ zinc which are 105.28 (Ú/Npy Ã/Zn Ã/N) and 99.88 (Ú/ Npy Ã/Zn Ã/O), respectively. The torsion angles around the aromatic planes and the di-imine chelate ring (Table 2) confirm that the structure of the pyridine adduct is generally more regular than the monohydrate. Selected bond distances and angles within the Salen framework are shown in Table 2 and discussed collectively below. 3.2. {Zn(Salpr)}2 Extending the alkyl chain between the two imine moieties by one methylene unit induces a profound change in the structure of the complex isolated. The material synthesised in pyridine and recrystallised from dichloromethane was found to be devoid of pyridine instead favouring a dimeric arrangement. However, the structure obtained for Zn(Salpr) can still be described in a manner which is consistent with a five coordinate environment. The dimeric structure (Fig. 4) contains three distinct Zn Ã/O distances (195.5, 204.1 and 209.2 pm). As expected the shortest of these is found for the bond between the zinc and the unbridged oxygen (Zn1 Ã/ O1). However, of some surprise is that the Zn Ã/O distance to the oxygen derived from the adjacent ligand is shorter than to the oxygen within the chelating Salpr unit. This observation substantiates the view of this complex as a five coordinate dimer. This finding in itself was surprising not just because the complex was prepared deliberately in pyridine but also because the analogous copper and nickel complexes have been

reported, where the fifth coordination site is filled by a bridging oxygen [22] or a water ligand [23,24] (Table 2). The facial arrangement of the Zn(Salpr) units and formation of oxygen bridges significantly distorts the pyramidal shape (c.f. [Ni(Salpr)OH2] and [Cu(Salpr)OH2]) and consequently the Ú/O2 Ã/Zn Ã/O2* is highly constrained (778). The motif retrieved here for Zn(Salpr) closely follows that predicted by Batley and Graddon [15]. However, the system characterised by us is dimeric rather than polymeric and there is a far stronger association between the zinc units than might have been predicted. Considering the lack of solubility of the bulk material it is thought that the species structurally characterised here

is the simplest homologue of a series of polymers, i.e. [Zn(Salpr)]n , n0/2, which has been preferentially extracted from the bulk material. The structure of Zn(Salpr) displayed here contrasts markedly with the two other reported Zn(Salpr) species namely [(ZnSalpr)HOMe]ZnCl2 [17] and {[(ZnSalpr)2](OAc)2Zn} [18] which are bi and tri metallic (c.f. Zn(Salbu) below). The contrast between these two motifs again [1] indicates that structural divergence occurs at this juncture i.e. where the alkyl chain between the two imine moieties contains three or more methylene units. 3.3. ZnSalbu Unfortunately the structural progression was interrupted at Salbu as no simple complex could be structurally characterised. However, from the mixture it was possible to isolate crystals of an important minor component, {[Zn(Salbu)]2(OAc)2Zn}, which could be prepared by a more rational route. Intriguingly, this species follows the reported structures of ({[ZnSalpr]2[OAc]2Zn}) [18] and ({[Ni(Salbu)DMF]2[OAc]2Ni}) [1] in that we obtain a trimetallic complex (Fig. 5). The motif in the vicinity of the Salbu ligand is a typical five coordinate zinc environment with a slight saddle shape in the `plane' defined by the Schiff's base donors (Table 2) and the zinc atom. The increased size of the chelate ring demands that the ligand alters certain characteristics to accommodate the additional ring methylene unit. Thus we observe an large increase (c.f. {[ZnSalpr]2[OAc]2Zn}; 3.58) in the torsion angles associated with the aromatic planes (32.18) and imine regions (39.88) and a divergence of the M Ã/N and M Ã/O bond distances to values greater and smaller than the respec-

tive Salpr complex (Table 2). The effect of the buckling in the Salbu ligand also affects the geometry at the apical acetate ligand (Ú/OAcÃ/Zn Ã/N, 96.18 and 117.08; Ú/OAcÃ/Zn Ã/O, 90.58 and 106.78) which moves away from the more regular pyramidal values observed for the ZnSalpr complex [18] (Ú/OAc Ã/Zn Ã/N, 102.98 and 104.98; Ú/OAcÃ/Zn Ã/O 101.28 and 103.78).

3.4. Structural homology The structural homology of zinc Schiff's base complexes has been unclear for many years. Our ability to crystallise additional representative species offers us an opportunity to identify and clarify certain key patterns available to zinc. It has been known for some time that the simple Salen complexes of zinc can have two interchangeable forms, a five coordinate motif (viz. Zn(Salen)L, L 0/Pyridine, H2O) and an anhydrous form. In the absence of any substantive structural data Bately resorted to spectroscopic measurements to suggest a structure for the anhydrous forms of Zn(Salen) and Zn(Salpr). Notably the motif isolated for Zn(Salpr) is not vastly different to that suggested and consequently it is proposed that this motif is representative of Zn(Salen) also. Batley formed the opinion that since Zn(Salbu) would not form a pyridine adduct that it must be four coordinate. However, their supporting IR infrared evidence (phenolic nC Ã/O at 1530 cm(1) is at odds with current band assignments. Furthermore, we now know that five coordinate complexes do form when suitable ligands such as acetate are involved (Fig. 5). Thus with the realisation that Salbu affords greater flexibility and thus less strain and that with suitable ligands and environments five coordinate species are highly favoured, we believe that Zn(Salbu) structurally follows Salpr and Salen and is an oxygen bridged polymer in its simplest form. Although ZnSalen is content to adopt a five coordinate environment as yet no complexes have been clearly identified which include a second metal complexed to the oxygen donor atoms (c.f. Salen complexes of nickel [3] and copper [25]). In contrast to Salen, zinc complexes of Salpr and Salbu would seem to readily accept a second guest metal cation thus forming bi and tri metallic complexes. This behaviour is a common feature for Salpr and Salbu complexes of late transition metals [1] (Tables 2 and 3). The contrast between the ligand sets here is marked. However, there is little evidence to suggest that Salpr and Salbu have more favourable donor characteristics than Salen. The propensity of these complexes to accept a guest metal in this manner most probably arises from the greater degree of flexibility afforded to the Salpr and Salbu ligands, allowing them to cantilever into a more accommodating orientation for complexation. Indeed a narrowing of the

Although the trans Ú/OÃ/Zn2Ã/O angles are 1808 the cis Ú/OÃ/ZnÃ/O angles are more variable with the somewhat tighter internal Ú/O1Ã/Zn1Ã/O2 angle (76.98) being compensated by the more obtuse cross Salbu Ú/O1Ã/Zn2Ã/O1 angle (103.18).

The Ú OÃ MÃ N angles are used to depict the geometry within the metal Á/ligand plane. The MÃ N and MÃ O distances are presented as a measure of the change in the ligand to metal bond nature. The torsion angles associated with the region adjacent to the two imine moieties and aromatic planes are used to show how the ligand contorts to accommodate the desired geometry of the metal centre.

internal Ú/O Ã/Zn Ã/O angle is observed between Zn(Salen)NC5H5 (93.38) and {[Zn(Salbu)]2(OAc)2Zn} (79.98). 3.5. Comparative analysis The isolation of the three zinc complexes above completes the matrix of motifs, which can be constructed between Salen, Salpr and Salbut with nickel [1], copper [4,8 Á/11,18] (Table 3) and zinc. By combining the data above with the existing data it is possible to demonstrate clearly the structural geometry available to these ligands [1] (Tables 2 and 3) with these metals. Unsurprisingly the Salen ligand remains conformationally restricted to planar and square-pyramid geometries at the metal centre. Within these planar geometries any strain would seem to be transmitted into the alkyl chain between the two imine moieties where Ã/CN Ã/NC torsion angles of 208 are commonly observed. By virtue of the stability of the chair conformation six membered rings, Salpr also demonstrate a preference for a meridial arrangement (e.g. planar and pyrimidal geometry). However, in contrast to Salen, Salpr also supports mer -octahedral configurations. Unlike Salen the increased freedom afforded by the extra methylene unit would seem to be able to offset the torsional strain in the di-imine region with angles falling to negligible values (Table 2). At this juncture the incorporation of additional metals at the phenolic oxygen's becomes highly favoured and we observed a trend towards bi and tri metallic systems. The greatest geometric variation is found for the Salbu ligand which can be seen to support five different geometries; namely distorted tetrahedral (CuSalbu) [18], planar (NiSalbu) [7], square based pyramid (Zn(Salbu), mer -Oh (NiSalbu) [1] and fac -Oh (NiSalbu) [1]. In all examples of Salbu complexes the formation of the seven

membered ring creates some strain in the backbone. The M Ã/O and M Ã/N distances are in general longer [1] (Tables 2 and 3). This strain is sufficient to facilitate the adoption of a fac- octahedral geometries with nickel. In the structural chemistry of copper (Table 2) it manifests itself as clear shift from a planar to a heavily distorted tetrahedral motif. Our inability to isolate a regular tetrahedral motif with this ligand set probably stems simply from the geometric preferences of the metal cations studied (e.g. Ni(II) and Cu(II)) each of which will prefer either a planar or a more distorted conformation. Studies currently being conducted clearly show that a butanediamine based ligand system coupled to copper(I) can move to a tetrahedral motif once the electronic factors are accommodated. Overall the Salbu ligand offers the widest possible conformational flexibility (Fig. 2) which suggests that a generic system could be designed which could support metal cations during chemistry which operate at the extremes of conformational change. The preponderance of the complexes themselves to act as ligands via the formation of bridging oxygen's could be considered as both an advantage or disadvantage and will need great consideration during any refinement of this concept.
