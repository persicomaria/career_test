The analysis of the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus genome revealed the first virus-encoded nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), an enzyme that is central to the synthesis of RNA and DNA, ubiquitous in cellular organisms, and well conserved among the three domains of life. In contrast with the broad specificity of cellular NDKs for all types of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides, the mimivirus enzyme exhibits a strongly preferential affinity for deoxypyrimidines. In order to elucidate the molecular basis of this unique substrate specificity, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus NDK alone and in complex with various nucleotides. As predicted from a sequence comparison with cellular NDKs, the 3D structure of the mimivirus enzyme exhibits a shorter Kpn loop, previously recognized as a main feature of the NDK active site. The structure of the viral enzyme in complex with various nucleotides also pinpointed two residue changes, both located near the active site and specific to the viral NDK, which could explain its stronger affinity for deoxynucleotides and pyrimidine nucleotides. The role of these residues was explored by building a set of viral NDK variants, assaying their enzymatic activities, and determining their 3D structures in complex with various nucleotides. A total of 26 crystallographic structures were determined at resolutions ranging from 2.8 Å to 1.5 Å. Our results suggest that the mimivirus enzyme progressively evolved from an ancestral NDK under the constraints of optimizing its efficiency for the replication of an AT-rich (73%) viral genome in a thymidine-limited host environment. Mimivirus, a DNA virus infecting Acanthamoeba, is the largest and most complex virus isolated to date (8, 37). It is the first representative and prototype member of the Mimiviridae, the latest addition to the large nucleocytoplasmic DNA viruses, including the poxviruses, the phycodnaviruses, (infecting algae), the iridoviruses (infecting invertebrates and fishes), and asfarvirus (the agent of a swine fever in Africa) (18). The mimivirus's record genome size (1.2 Mb) and gene content (911 encoded proteins), as well as the presence of genes previously thought to be specific to cellular organisms (such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [3]), revived the debate about the evolutionary origin of DNA viruses and their putative role in the emergence of the eukaryote nucleus (reviewed in reference 7) or in the advent of DNA genomes (13). In this peculiar context, we found the discovery of the first virus-encoded nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) within the mimivirus genome of great interest and warranting a detailed study of the structural and biochemical properties of this unique viral enzyme. Ubiquitous in cellular organisms, NDKs are responsible for the last step of 2 -deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pathways and as such play an essential role in the replication of DNA by providing the basic precursors for its synthesis.

oxyribonucleotides, the cellular NDKs are also responsible for supplying energy to various essential synthetic pathways, producing NTPs for RNA synthesis, CTP for lipid synthesis, UTP for polysaccharide synthesis, and GTP for protein synthesis elongation, signal transduction, and microtubules polymerization. Besides their direct role in the above metabolic pathways, cellular NDKs have been involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in vertebrates (22). Cellular NDKs are small proteins of about 150 amino acids, the sequences of which are highly conserved among the three domains of life ( 40% identity). They are most often hexameric enzymes, with a few occurrences of tetrameric and dimeric NDK structures in bacteria (19, 25, 26, 31, 38). They all catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from an NTP onto a nucleotide diphosphate (NDP) through an Mg2 -dependent reaction. In vivo, the phosphate donor is usually the nonlimiting ATP nucleotide. In agreement with their implication in various metabolic pathways, cellular NDKs exhibit little substrate specificity and are equally able to act on purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, in their 2 OH and deoxyribonucleotide forms. In clear contrast, our characterization of the mimivirus NDK revealed its enhanced affinity for deoxypyrimidine nucleotides (20). This marked difference between the viral and cellular NDKs offered a good opportunity to explore the sequence and structure features governing substrate specificity. For instance, cellular NDKs exhibit a conserved loop, the Kpn loop, involved both in substrate binding and in oligomerization of the enzyme (19). Interestingly, a sequence comparison predicted this loop to be shorter in the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus NDK (NDKapm) sequence. However, many other single-residue changes could also be involved in modifying the enzyme prop-

erties. To explore these issues, we performed a detailed structure-function analysis of the NDKapm protein in a variety of mutated forms and substrate-enzyme complexes. Despite its markedly different sequence, the three-dimensional structure of the mimivirus NDK was found to be very similar to that of cellular enzymes. Its peculiar substrate specificity is not attributable to a single sequence feature but rather appears to result from the conjunction of several factors, suggesting the progressive optimization of an ancestral enzyme for the replication of an AT-rich (73%) genome in a thymidine-limited host environment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS NDKapm was cloned and expressed as previously described (20, 21) (see the supplemental material). The N62L and R107G mutations, as well as the insertion of the Kpn sequence ( Kpn) from Dictyostelium discoideum, were produced using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide sequences are presented in the supplemental material. Protein purification and crystallization. The recombinant mimivirus NDK protein was purified and crystallized as described earlier (2, 21). NDK-nucleotide stoichiometric complexes were produced by incubating the freshly purified recombinant NDKapm protein in the presence of 5 mM Mg2 with 5 mM nucleotides (dTTP, dGTP, GTP, dUTP, UTP, and CTP). Each complex was purified on a HiTrap chelating column charged with Ni2 and recovered in the specific elution fractions. After 2 weeks, 90% of the protein was spontaneously transformed into a truncated form. N-terminal sequencing revealed that 15 residues of the 21-residue tag had been removed. Complexes were concentrated in 10 mM CHES buffer [2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonate, pH 9.0] and repurified after 2 weeks to recover the tag-free complexes. NDKapm-dTTP was concentrated to 26 mg ml 1 and complexes of NDKapm with dGTP, GTP, CTP, UTP, or dUTP to 11 mg ml 1. The NDK mutants were concentrated in 10 mM CHES buffer (pH 9.0) and incubated with 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM NTP overnight prior to crystallization without further purification. Due to the ATPase activity of NDK enzymes, the NTP nucleotides are spontaneously transformed into NDP (25), as evidenced by the complex structures. Consequently, all NDK complexes contain NDP even if NTP was used for crystallization. Crystallization of the NDKapm and the NDK mutant nucleotide complexes was performed by vapor diffusion experiments. Conditions were initially identified through a previously described screening protocol (2) (see the supplemental material). For the nucleotide complexes of NDKapm (26 mg ml 1), NDKN62L (11 mg ml 1), NDKR107G (11.7 mg ml 1), NDKR107G-N62L (11 mg ml 1), NDK Kpn-N62L (11.8 mg ml 1), and NDK Kpn-N62L-R107G (11.5 mg ml 1), crystals were obtained using MPD (2-methyl-2,4-pentane-d12-diol) concentrations from 40 to 45% (vol/vol) in 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5) or 0.1 M MOPS (pH 7.4). These crystals belong to the C2221 space group, with six monomers per asymmetric unit. Crystals of the NDK Kpn (13 mg ml 1), NDK Kpn-N62L (13.3 mg ml 1), NDK Kpn-R107G (10.7 mg ml 1), and NDK Kpn-N62L-R107G (11.5 mg ml 1) mutants were obtained using 0.8 to 1.2 M sodium citrate, 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.6). They belong to the P63 space group, with two monomers per asymmetric unit. Data collection and processing. Crystals produced in sodium citrate were soaked for 1 min in a reservoir solution containing 10% glycerol as a cryoprotectant, collected in Hampton Research loops, flash frozen to 105 K in a cold nitrogen gas stream, and subjected to X-ray diffraction. MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 package (9) were used for the processing, scaling, and data reduction. Data sets were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation facility (see Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material) or in-house using a Xcalibur PX-Ultra diffraction system (Oxford Diffraction). A previously described evaporation protocol (1) was used to improve the diffraction of some crystals. Structure determination. (i) Native form. The structure of the NDKapm native form was solved as previously described (21) (see the supplemental material). Refinement of the molecular replacement solution structures was performed using crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (5), including simulated annealing and positional and B-factor refinement. Addition of solvent molecules and a final round of refinement resulted in a final model made of residues 4 to 129 and 0 to 129 for the two molecules and a final Rwork of 20.2% and Rfree of 25.2%. (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The difference density map

exhibited two peaks near the substrate binding site corresponding to two sulfate ions. (ii) NDKapm in complex with nucleotides. A crystal of the NDKapm-dTDP complex was used to compute a self rotation function and determine the entities constituting the crystal using AMoRe software (33). A trimer of the apo form was successfully used to search for a molecular replacement solution using AMoRe software. Refinement was performed using crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (5), which resulted in a final model made of six molecules in the asymmetric unit, including residues 1 to 131, 0 to 131, and 0 to 131 for the first trimer and residues 1 to 130, 0 to 131, and 0 to 129 for the second one, with a final Rwork of 19.9% and Rfree of 23% (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Other complexes were solved using this structure as a reference and the difference density maps to build the nucleotide and position the Mg2 ion (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). (iii) NDKapm mutants in complex with nucleotides. The NDKN62L, NDKR107G, and NDKN62L-R107G complexes were crystallized like the native form in the same space group and with comparable cell dimensions. The native hexameric structure was used as the initial template, with a first round of rigid body refinement using Refmac (32). The interactive COOT software (11) was then used to build the different ligands and to manually refine each of the monomer structures using the difference density maps. We performed 10 cycles of refinement using the integrated Refmac program (32) after each round of manual building. For the NDK Kpn-N62L and NDK Kpn-N62L-R107G nucleotide complexes, other conditions were identified (see above) for which crystals exhibited better diffraction and contained only two molecules per asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement was used to determine the corresponding structures, and COOT software (11) was used for manual building and refinement. To verify that the nucleotide orientation into the enzyme active site was not influenced by the crystallization conditions, we determined and compared the NDK Kpn-N62L-dTDP structures in both space groups. Enzymatic activity measurements. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae NDK enzyme (NDKsc; Sigma-Aldrich no. N0379) was used as a control. All NDKapm mutants were compared to the native NDKapm recombinant protein using a coupled assay on microtiter plates by measuring the absorbance at 340 nm (20). Activity was measured through NADH oxidation using a quant spectrophotometer (Biotech Instrument) and 96-well UV plates (PS-Microplate; Greiner Bio-one). The reaction was performed in a 100- l volume containing 5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mM NADH, 1 mM ATP, and 1 active unit of pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), with the various (d)NDPs at various concentrations and with optimized quantities of NDK enzymes. For the native enzyme as well as for all mutants, the protein concentrations were determined so as to be in the linear part of the curve of the enzyme activity obtained for 75 M dGDP and increasing concentration of enzymes (between 0.1 and 26 g ml 1), as follows: NDKapm, 1.6 g/ml; NDK-N62L and NDK-N62L-R107G, 3.25 g/ml; NDK Kpn-N62L-R107G, NDK Kpn, NDK Kpn-N62L, and NDK-R107G, 6.5 g/ml; and NDKsc, 0.64 g/ml. This assay was used for all (d)NDPs as phosphate acceptors except for ADP (for which ATP is the phosphate donor). Initial velocities were determined at least twice for each substrate concentration, with duplicate measurements varying by less than 5%. Protein sequence accession numbers. The PDB accession numbers for the structures determined in this study are 2B8P, 2B8Q, 3B6B, 3EE3, 3EIC, 3EJM, 3ELH, 3ETM, 3EM1, 3EVM, 3EVO, 3EVW, 3EMT, 3ENA, 3DKD, 3DDI, 3FC9, 3FCV, 3FCW, 3FBB, 3FBC, 3FBE, 3FBF, 3G2X, 3GP9, and 3GPA.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structures of the NDKapm enzyme alone and in complex with various substrates. As expected from negative stain electron microscopy images (Irina Gutsche [UMR 5233 UJFEMBL-CNRS], personal communication) and gel filtration studies (20), the mimivirus NDK is hexameric (dimer of trimers) (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material) in the crystal with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.5 Å based on C superimposition with the D. discoideum NDK hexamer structure (NDKdd; PDB no. 1NDC) (6). The trimer formation involves interactions between the 3 and k helices and between the 0 and 1 helices. The dimer formation involves the

Red boxes indicate strictly conserved residues; residues in red type have conserved properties.

1 helix and an antiparallel arrangement of the 2 strands of two NDK monomers (Fig. 1 and 2). The surface comparison of all available NDK structures showed conserved hydrophobic patches at the two trimer interfaces, while the hexamer surfaces were found to differ from one structure to another. NDK enzymes, besides their main enzymatic functions, have been reported to be involved in signaling cascades through the activation of guanine nucleotidebinding proteins (10, 12, 27) and in protein-DNA-RNA interactions (28). Endonuclease, exonuclease, DNase, and RNase activities have also been reported (15, 23, 36, 39). The variations in the hexameric surfaces may be correlated to the different localizations or cellular functions of these NDK proteins. A common feature of all NDK structures is a central channel formed through a salt bridge involving two conserved residues of the same monomer (R24 and D101) and two nonconserved residues between two monomers. In the mimivirus NDK structure, this interaction corresponds to a salt bridge between E20 of one monomer and K27 of the second monomer. There is also a ring of positively charged residues around

the central channel and negatively charged patches on the hexamer external edges. While the buried surface area is roughly the same between two monomers (1,000 Å2) and between the two trimers (2,500 Å2) in all NDK structures, the buried surface area is much smaller in the NDKapm trimer than in other NDK structures (2,140 Å2 instead of 3,130 Å2 for D. discoideum) on account of a shorter Kpn loop. In previous studies, this loop was identified as a central element for NDK enzymatic activities and for the association of monomers in a hexameric structure (19). We analyzed the structure of the NDKapm in complex with various nucleotides, in order to understand the molecular basis of its enhanced affinity for deoxypyrimidine nucleotides (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). As for the other NDK structures, the nucleotide fixation at the substrate binding site does not induce major conformational changes. Despite the use of different crystallization conditions, the maximum measured RMSD between the free and the bound enzyme is 0.5 Å, based on C superimposition of the hexamers. The comparison of these complexes with other NDK complexes demon-

FIG. 2. Unique features of the NDKapm structure. Cartoon representation of the NDKapm structure (yellow), with the Kpn loop highlighted in red and the LKpnI- K segment absent from the NDKapm structure in green. Residues conserved in other NDK structures are presented in green, and the corresponding residues in NDKapm are in blue. The dTDP/Mg2 nucleotide is in cyan, and two water molecules at the LKpn1 location are in gray.

strates that the residues known to be important for the enzyme activity are conserved in the NDKapm structure. The phosphoryl is transferred to the N of a conserved histidine residue, H112 in NDKapm (H122 in NDKdd), in the presence of the donor nucleotide and Mg2 ions, and the N of the imidazole ring is stabilized by the conserved S114 and E123 residues (S124 and E133 in NDKdd), both of which maintain the histidine residue in the proper orientation. In all NDK structures, there is a hydrophobic residue that adopts a disallowed conformation to keep the substrate accessible in the active site, and this residue corresponds to L110 in NDKapm (I120 in NDKdd). The conserved phenylalanine residue (F64 in NDKdd) stabilizing the base moiety through aromatic stacking is replaced by a superimposable tyrosine residue in the viral enzyme (Y58). The phosphate environment is the same in all NDK structures with protein interactions between the NDK protein and the nucleotide phosphate groups involving the conserved residues K9, Y50, R86, R99, and N109 (K16, Y56, R92, R109, and N119 in NDKdd). The ribose 3 OH makes hydrogen bonds with K9 and N109. Finally, the comparison of the NDKapm/dTDP structure highlighted three main differences with other NDK binding sites which could explain the peculiar affinity of the mimivirus NDK for deoxypyrimidine nucleotides (Fig. 2). The most obvious sequence difference, the shorter Kpn loop in the viral protein, results in a wider substrate binding site compared to other structures. The shortening of the Kpn loop

is precisely located in the LKpnI region (Fig. 1). The NDK nucleotide binding site can be described as a tong-like structure made of the 2 helix on one side and part of the Kpn loop (LKpn2) on the other side. Interestingly, there are two ordered water molecules at the position of the missing LKpnI segment (Fig. 2) which appear to stabilize the NDKapm active site through hydrogen bonds between the shorter LKpnI and LKpn2 parts of the Kpn loop. Another difference between the mimivirus NDK and other NDK structures is the replacement of an otherwise conserved glycine residue in LKpn2 by an exposed arginine residue (R107) on the edge of the active site. This arginine residue forms hydrogen bonds with the dTDP by a direct interaction between the R107 N and the base moiety (Fig. 2; also see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). Finally, deep in the nucleotide binding site, an otherwise strictly conserved leucine in the 2 helix is replaced by an asparagine (N62) in the viral NDK. The side chain (O 1, N 2) of this asparagine residue forms hydrogen bonds with the ribose moiety of the nucleotide, as well as with the oxygen (O2) of the pyrimidine base (see Fig. S3B in the supplemental material). To explore the respective contributions of these changes on the substrate specificity of the mimivirus NDK, we generated a set of mutants restoring a standard sequence. The tested mutations included (i) the reinsertion of a standard Kpn loop ( Kpn), (ii) two single mutations (R107G and N62L), and (iii) the combination of all mutations, including the triple mutant. We then determined the crystal structures of the NDK mutants in complex with various nucleotides and assayed their activities on deoxyribo- and ribonucleotides. Structure comparison of the NDK mutants with the NDKapm nucleotide complexes. The comparison of mimivirus NDK structure with the structures of the mutant NDKs did not reveal any overall differences. The structures remained hexameric, and the C -based RMSDs between the seven mutants and the native enzyme in complex with nucleotides and the apo enzyme structures are of the same magnitude. When visible, the Mg2 ion associated with the nucleotide remained at the same position in all NDK structures (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material), forming a bridge between the two oxygens of the - and -phosphates and stabilized by ordered water molecules. The most striking differences were observed at the nucleotide binding site, with variations in the nucleotide position depending on its nature and on the enzyme crystallized. (i) Complexes with deoxypyrimidine nucleotides. In the deoxypyrimidine complexes, the nucleotide base penetrates deeper into the active site of the native NDKapm enzyme than in the D. discoideum NDK-dTDP complex structure (1NDC) (6). In the N62L and R107G mutants, the nucleotide is less deeply buried than in the native enzyme, but the overall complex structures are very agitated (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). In the N62L-R107G NDK mutant in complex with deoxypyrimidine, the nucleotide is barely visible. This is compatible with a decrease in affinity for the dTDP in the double mutant. For Kpn, Kpn-N62L, and the triple mutants, the positioning of the nucleotide is close to that observed in the D. discoideum NDK complex structure (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). We verified that the complex structures did not depend on crystallization conditions by comparing the Kpn-N62L mutant structure in complex with dTDP in

the two crystal forms (C2221 and P63). Both protein and ligand structures are superimposable (0.3-Å RMSD main chain; 0.2-Å ligand atoms). (i) Complexes with pyrimidine ribonucleotides. In the N62L, N62L-R107G, and Kpn-N62L mutant complexes with a 2 OH pyrimidine, the nucleotide base is positioned as in the native NDKapm complex structure, deeper in the active site than in the Halobacterium salinarum NDK-CDP complex structure (2AZ3) (4), while in the triple NDKapm mutant complex, the nucleotide position is restored to one close to that observed in the 2AZ3 structure (Fig. 3). (iii) Complexes with deoxypurine nucleotides. In the structure of NDKapm in complex with dGDP, we observed an agitated dGDP ligand exhibiting three different conformations (Fig. 4). One of them (chain D; B factordGDP 58 Å2) corresponds to the conformation observed in the Arabidopsis thaliana NDK enzyme in complex with dGDP (1S59) (16) (B factordGDP 80 Å2). The second conformation shows a 180° rotation of the nucleotide base (chains A and E; B factordGDP 66 Å2), while in the last conformation, both the ribose and the base parts are rotated by 180° (chains B, C, and F; B factordGDP 56, 54, and 66.5 Å2). Interestingly, in the

NDK Kpn-R107G double mutant and NDK Kpn-N62L-R107G triple mutant, the nucleotide is well ordered and adopts the conformation observed in the 1S59 structure (B factordGDP 17.9 and 14.9 Å2). (iv) Complexes with purine ribonucleotides. In complex with the native enzyme, the GDP is highly disordered despite the high-resolution data. The electronic density permits the positioning of only the phosphate groups, while the base and ribose moiety are barely visible (B factorsGDP between 50 and 100 Å2). The GDP nucleotide exhibits a 180° rotation compared to its orientation in other available structures (2DXE [M. KatoMurayama, K. Murayama, T. Terada, M. Shirouzu, and S. Yokoyama, unpublished data], B factorGDP 30 Å2; 1WKK [S. Takeishi, N. Nakagawa, R. Masui, and S. Kuramitsu, unpublished data], B factorGDP 50 Å2; 1NUE [30], B factorGDP 20 Å2; and 1BHN [24], B factorGDP 90 Å2), with the 2 OH and 3 OH being exposed to the solvent (Fig. 5). The R107 residue is disordered in the native enzyme. For the NDK Kpn mutant, the nucleotide, clearly visible, adopts two main conformations, one similar to that observed in other NDK-GDP complexes and the other having the base rotated by 180° as in the native enzyme GDP complex, suggesting that the Kpn loop stabilizes this nucleotide in the enzyme binding site, even if not in an orientation optimal for phosphorylation. In both molecules, the arginine residue (R111) NH2 is pointing toward the base and located 3.1 Å from the N2 of the GDP base in the first GDP orientation and 3.56 Å from the O6 oxygen in the second GDP orientation (Fig. 5). The B factorsGDP are roughly the same, 30Å2, for both GDP molecules. In the NDK Kpn-N62LR107G triple mutant, where the arginine residue is replaced by a glycine, the nucleotide conformation is restored to that observed in other NDK structures (B factorGDP, 14 Å2) in agreement with the stabilization of the purine nucleotide by the longer Kpn loop and the restoration of a standard orientation by the two other mutations. Characterization of the NDKapm enzymatic activity. To complement our structural study, we measured the enzymatic activities of the seven mutants on various nucleotide substrates. For the native enzyme as well as for some mutants, the high affinity for deoxypyrimidine nucleotides prevented the direct measure of the Km values. We thus could only estimate the affinity of the enzymes for these nucleotides (Table 1; Fig. 6). It is worth noting that for each NDK enzyme, the Vmax was of the same order of magnitude for all nucleotides.

As expected from our structural analyses, the triple mutant restored a "cellular" NDK phenotype, with equivalent Km values for all tested nucleotides in the 0.1 mM range (Table 1; Fig. 6). We thus dissected the respective contributions of each mutation on all types of nucleotides. Our results for the NDK Kpn mutant were at odds with our hypothesis that the shorter Kpn loop of the mimivirus NDK was the main cause of the enhanced deoxypyrimidine affinity, since the activity of this mutant was still inhibited by concentrations of dTDP as low as 0.025 mM. On the other hand, restoring the longer Kpn loop induced an almost twofold increase in affinity for dGDP. A narrower active site thus appears to stabilize the binding of purine nucleotides, as suggested by the ordered GDP nucleotide in the NDK Kpn mutant, even if not in an optimal conformation. Overall, the most prominent sequence difference between the mimivirus NDK and its cellular homologues, i.e., a shorter Kpn loop, is not sufficient to account for the enhanced affinity for pyrimidine nucleotides. The second variation, leucine to asparagine (N62), involves a residue deep in the active binding site, close to the ribose of the nucleotide in complex structures. This residue change could be responsible for the lower affinity of the enzyme for 2 OH nucleotides due to a repulsive effect. Our activity measurements are consistent with this hypothesis, since the restoration of the leucine induces a twofold increase in CDP and UDP Km values compared to the value for the native enzyme (Table 1). There is also a significant decrease in the affinity for the deoxypyrimidine nucleotides and almost no change for deoxypurine nucleotides. This observation can be explained by a second effect of the N62 residue: the stabilization of the pyrimidine nucleotide through a hydrogen bond between the N62-N 2 and the O2 of the base moiety. Since this oxygen is

absent from the purines, the absence of interaction in the N-to-L mutant does not affect the binding of GDP and ADP nucleotides. In conclusion, the N 2 of N62 stabilizes the deoxypyrimidine nucleotide through a direct interaction with the O2 of the base, and the O 1 of the N62 residue repels 2 OH nucleotides. This is supported by the Kpn-N62L double mutant and triple mutant structures, for which we obtained high-resolution data (1.5 and 1.6 Å, respectively), allowing us to clearly position the side chain and the N 2 versus O 1 atoms relative to the nucleotide. Finally, the most dramatic effect was observed for the R107G mutation, which caused a drastic decrease of the enzyme affinity for pyrimidine nucleotides, permitting us to directly measure the kinetic constants of the NDKR107G mutant. The Km values increased more than threefold for deoxypyrimidine and twofold for pyrimidine nucleotides (Table 1). These results confirm the central role of R107 in nucleotide stabilization through hydrogen bonds between the R107-N and the O2 of the pyrimidine base moiety. We examined the numerous available sequences of NDK homologues to identify additional variations at the three conserved positions divergent in the mimivirus NDK. The shorter Kpn loop seems to be a unique feature of the NDKapm. No occurrence of a similar mutation could be found in the available databases, including environmental sequences. A direct consequence of this shorter loop is the widening of the binding site, which in turn causes a decreased affinity for GDP confirmed by its agitation in the structures of the NDKapm enzyme and in the NDKN62L-R107G double mutant (see Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). This nucleotide becomes ordered in the NDK Kpn mutant and in the NDK Kpn-N62L-R107G triple mutant. The wider binding

site of the mimivirus NDK may also allow larger substrates to be accommodated, eventually broadening its enzymatic activity. The biological relevance of the shorter Kpn loop might thus go beyond the sole variation in nucleotide specificity. The point N62L variation in the NDKapm sequence was found in another variant of the otherwise strictly conserved leucine residue (L62). It is replaced by a methionine in the

Saccharomyces cerevisiae (G C content 40%) NDK sequence. Finally, the position corresponding to the R107G variation in the mimivirus NDK is less conserved. There are a number of natural NDK sequence variants, with an extreme case being the P. aerophilum NDK (Fig. 1), where this residue is replaced by a 10-amino-acid insert, which also affects the substrate specificity (17). Interestingly, a randomly generated G3R mutant of the archaeal H. salinarum

NDK (67% G C) also resulted in an increase in the enzyme affinity for pyrimidine nucleotides (35), thus confirming the critical role of this amino acid for substrate specificity. In conclusion, there are multiple causes of the viral NDKapm enzyme specificity pattern, since no single change was found to restore a "cellular" behavior. This is consistent with the viral enzyme's progressive evolution from an ancestral NDK in response to the AT richness of the viral genome (A T content, 73%). Since the genome of the mimivirus host, Acanthamoeba, has a 40% A T content, dTTP is probably the limiting nucleotide for the virus replication. It thus makes some sense that the NDKapm adapted its specificity pattern to better take advantage of the small concentration of dTDP in the amoeba host cell. It is worth noting that mimivirus also possesses a mitochondrial carrier protein that exhibits a strong preference for the dTTP and dATP deoxynucleotides (29). This again suggests that dTTP is in limited supply for viral replication. Moreover, the mimivirus genome encodes additional enzymes involved in dTTP biosynthesis, such as a thymidine kinase (responsible for dT/dU transformation into dTMP/dUMP) and a thymidylate synthase (producing dTMP from dUMP). Mimivirus also possesses its own deoxyribonucleotide monophosphate kinase transforming a deoxynucleoside monophosphate into a deoxynucleoside diphosphate and is thus able to produce dTDP from dTMP; a ribonucleoside reductase responsible for the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (e.g., dADP, dGDP, and dCDP) is also present. In contrast, mimivirus lacks a dUTPase, an enzyme found in most DNA viruses to prevent the misincorporation of dU in DNA. The strong affinity of the NDKapm is consistent with its possible role in preventing the accumulation of dUTP in vivo, as already suggested for the Escherichia coli enzyme (34). It thus appears that throughout its evolution, mimivirus has maintained its capacity to actively shape the pool of deoxynucleotides necessary to the biosynthesis of its DNA, a process for which the NDK appears increasingly central (34). The phylogenetic position of the mimivirus enzyme among NDK sequences from all domains (bacteria, archaea, and eukarya) illustrates the distance between the A. castellanii NDK and its viral counterpart (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). The mimivirus enzyme clusters with a group of euryarcheal, crenarcheal, actinobacterial, and spirochete sequences while the A. castellanii sequence clusters with fungal, alveolate, and metazoan sequences. This result favors an ancestral origin of the NDKapm over its recent horizontal transfer from an eukaryotic organism. It is also consistent with the pairwise sequence comparison of the NDKapm with the A. castellanii NDK (mRNA accession number, EC110217), showing that the latter lacks all the specific features of the viral enzyme.
