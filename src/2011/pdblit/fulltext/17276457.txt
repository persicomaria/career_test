A good turn for DNA: the structure of integration host factor bound to DNA
Tom Ellenberger1 and Arthur Landy2
The crystal structure of integration host factor (IHF) complexed with DNA shows how a small heterodimeric protein can induce a big bend in DNA. IHF exerts leverage in the minor groove and wraps DNA around the body of the protein, providing another example of sequence-specific recognition of the minor groove.

The textbook picture of straight B-form DNA has little similarity to the actual structure of DNA in most biological contexts. The DNA double helix is subject to subtle, sequence-dependent variations in local structure or to marked distortions induced by DNA-binding proteins that bend or unwind the helix. This fact is abundantly evident in the coiling of DNA into chromatin by histone proteins. DNA bending can also enhance the selectivity of protein binding to specific sites, or it may orient several proteinbinding sites for the assembly of a multiprotein complex. The growing number of protein structures complexed with distorted DNA offers clues about how binding energy might stabilize otherwise unfavorable DNA conformations. The structure of Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF) complexed with DNA, recently reported by Phoebe Rice, Shu-wei Yang and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health [1], takes the field to a new extreme -- a protein-induced U-turn in DNA. The E. coli IHF was, as its name suggests, originally identified [2­4] and purified [5] as a host factor for the phage integrative recombination reaction. Like many other cellular proteins that were first identified through their effects on viral life cycles, IHF was subsequently shown to be a key player in cellular physiology. IHF is a small heterodimeric protein that binds in the minor groove of DNA [6] causing it to bend in a sequence-specific manner [7]. The extent of DNA bending induced by IHF in solution has been estimated by gel mobility analyses to be more than 140° [8]; DNA cyclization analysis estimated bending of approximately 180° [9].

Consistent with its image as a `big bender', IHF has been cast in many of its cellular roles as an architectural element that simply shapes DNA. One of the more flamboyant examples of IHF-induced bending involves its shaping of the DNA sequences, att sites, that participate in site-specific recombination. Three IHF sites are used for integrative recombination and two IHF sites (in concert with other small DNA bending proteins) for excisive recombination. IHF and the other DNA-bending proteins introduce three sharp bends in the att site DNAs and thereby facilitate the binding of several protomers of the heterobivalent DNA-binding protein integrase [10­13]. The result is a compact higher-order synaptic complex of approximately 400 kDa [14]. The role of IHF in recombination can be partially mimicked by replacing one or more IHF-binding sites with intrinsically curved DNA, or by replacing IHF with a different (sequence independent) DNA-bending protein, HU [15,16]. These results demonstrate the importance of DNA bending but also leave open the possibility of other roles for IHF. Another explanation for the difficulty in mimicking IHF function is the finding that these IHF-dependent structures can be extremely precise, as might be expected if creation of a particular DNA node is critical for recombination [17]. In a similar but less complex architectural role, IHF binding at a single site is used to bring together two flanking DNA-binding sites and thereby stimulate transcription of some 54 and 70 promoters. This role for IHF was first demonstrated for the nif operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae [18,19]. The list of systems where IHF has been shown to, or is thought to, function as an architectural element is both long and diverse [20­23]. In addition to its role in recombination and transcription, IHF-induced bending is also known to stabilize repressor binding [24] and to enhance transposition [25­27]. IHF also figures prominently in the initiation of DNA replication, as it is frequently a component of the multiprotein complexes which form at bacterial origins of replication [28]. In the case of oriC, the replication initiator of the E. coli chromosome, a single IHF cycles in and out of the oriC nucleoprotein complex in alternation with a single FIS protein, another small site-specific DNAbending protein [29]. This interplay of the two DNAbending proteins is postulated to aid the assembly of initiation complexes during the cell cycle and to block initiation at inappropriate times. IHF also assists in the melting of DNA strands in the oriC complex in preparation for the initiation of DNA replication [30]. IHF's role

(reviewed in [22]). These findings underscore IHF's biological importance as both a sequence-specific DNAbinding protein and as a DNA-bending element. Exactly how IHF produces a sharp bend in DNA has remained a mystery until recently. Phoebe Rice, Shu-wei Yang and their colleagues report the crystal structure of an IHF­DNA complex [1], which shows the clever use of several established principles for DNA bending that, together, take DNA bending to a new extreme. IHF is not the only small protein capable of inducing such extreme bends in DNA. Its closest relative, the protein HU, binds to DNA in a nonspecific manner (reviewed in [31]). A crystal structure of the unliganded HU homodimer from Bacillus stearothermophilus [32] shows a globular mixed structure with a pair of protruding arms consisting of antiparallel strands that extend away from the body of the protein. The distal portions of the arms are disordered in the absence of DNA; theoretical models of DNA complexes with HU [32,33] or IHF [34] place the arms in the minor groove, wrapping around the DNA. The crystal structure of the IHF­DNA complex reveals how the protruding arms induce a severe bend in DNA, as well as showing a novel mode of sequence-specific recognition of DNA in the minor groove. It is generally recognized that minor groove binding proteins can widen this otherwise narrow groove, bending the DNA away from the protein. More extreme bending or kinking of the DNA is caused by the intercalation of hydrophobic residues between base pairs, as seen in DNA complexes with TATA-binding protein [35,36] or the repressor proteins PurR [37] and LacI [38]. Another strategy for protein-induced DNA bending is the electrostatic binding of DNA phosphates to a curved DNA-binding surface, wrapping the DNA around the protein. Examples of proteins employing this method of bending include the E. coli catabolite activator protein [39], and papilloma virus E2 protein [40]. Additional stabilization of the bent DNA conformation is probably achieved by the selective neutralization of phosphate charges on the inside of the bend through interactions with a basic surface of the protein [41]. The crystal structure of the IHF­DNA complex (Fig 1; [1]) shows a novel implementation of these strategies for bending DNA. IHF is a heterodimer of homologous and subunits of approximately 11 kDa each (Fig. 2). The structure of the IHF protein in the DNA complex is in close agreement with that of the unliganded B. stearothermophilus HU homodimer [32], although the DNA-contacting arms are fully ordered only in the IHF­DNA complex. Whereas HU binds to DNA nonspecifically, IHF binds selectively to phage attachment (att) sites and to specific sequences within IHF-responsive promoters. The consensus binding site for IHF consists of three elements: two clusters of conserved base pairs (5-TATCAA-3 and

in chromosome trafficking extends to formation of the nucleoprotein complexes responsible for the proper partitioning of plasmids to daughter cells (for an overview see [28]). In addition to its role as an architectural DNAbending element, IHF may also function in a more straightforward fashion as a classical repressor or activator of gene expression. In this mode IHF would block transcription as a result of its binding site occluding or disturbing a promoter site; IHF would activate by virtue of contacts made with a specific domain of RNA polymerase

(green). (b) The H binding site from the lambda attP attachment site consists of three conserved elements shown in bold face; the dA/dTrich element is shown to the left of two conserved sequence elements, which are contacted in the minor groove by IHF. IHF residues that recognize these conserved sequence elements are shown, colored as in (a). (Sequence alignments were done with the program AMPS and displayed with ALSCRIPT [45].)

Sequences of IHF-related proteins and the H IHF-binding site. (a) The amino acid sequences of the IHF and subunits (IHF and IHF ), E. coli HU-1, E. coli HU-2, and B. stearothermophilus HU (BsHU) proteins are aligned; the sequences are highly homologous. The secondary structure of the IHF subunits is shown below the aligned sequences; strands are shown as arrows and helices as cylinders. Some of the IHF residues making direct or indirect contacts to the H binding site are colored, including the conserved intercalating Pro65

5-TTG-3; Fig. 2) and a dA/dT-rich element located one helical turn 5 to the consensus [42,43]. In the IHF­DNA crystal structure, IHF was complexed with a 35-mer stretch of DNA corresponding to the H IHF-binding site, which occurs naturally in the attP ( attachment site) DNA. The 35-mer DNA in the crystal structure wraps around the IHF heterodimer, bending more than 160° and reversing the direction of the DNA (Fig. 1). The DNA interaction surface of IHF is extensive; more than 4600Å2 of protein and DNA surface is buried in the complex [1]. The DNA bend is centered at the 5 end of the 5-TATCAA-3 element in the IHF-binding site. One side of the IHF dimer engages in sequence-specific interactions, and the opposite side contacts the dA/dT-rich sequence element. Two sharp kinks in the DNA are caused by the intercalation of conserved prolines from each arm of the dimer (Fig 1). The intercalated proline residues interrupt base pair stacking and cause the minor groove to open on either side of the center of the bend,

thus facilitating the tight wrapping of the DNA around the protein. The intertwined and subunits of the IHF dimer contact the bent DNA in a roughly symmetrical manner. However, protein contacts to the conserved bases of the `right' half of the binding site are extensive and intimate, whereas the dA/dT element on the `left' half of the complex is contacted via direct and water-mediated interactions with the DNA phosphates (Fig. 1). This segregation of protein interactions with the DNA backbone and the minor groove explains nicely IHF's relaxed specificity for the dA/dT element in comparison to the more strictlyspecific downstream sequences The arm of the subunit is in close contact with the minor groove of the 5-TATCAA-3 consensus element on the right-hand side of the complex. Arg63 of the arm is anchored to the DNA by a hydrogen bond from its backbone nitrogen to N3 of a nearby adenine (the penultimate adenine in the consensus element; Fig 2). Two arginines from the arm each make bidentate contacts to adjacent

bases located on opposite strands of the 5-TATCAA-3 consensus sequence (Fig. 2). As noted by the authors [1], contacts to the minor groove edges of bases do not uniquely specify the sequence of the binding site, and it is therefore likely that sequence-dependent details of minor groove conformation are recognized by IHF. The arm of the subunit is less intimately engaged in the minor groove, perhaps in part because of the discontinuity in the DNA backbone in this region. The body of the IHF dimer contacts the minor groove on either side of the complex, half a helical turn distal to the proline-induced kinks. Both subunits participate in electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone; helix 1 and the 1­ 2 loop of one subunit and helix 3 of the opposing subunit contact phosphates bordering the minor groove. The N termini of helices 1 and 3 of both subunits are oriented towards the DNA. On the left-hand side of the complex, one of the backbone contacts to the dA/dT-rich sequence is solvent-mediated, and the protein does not contact the DNA bases. The dA/dT-rich DNA is straight and has a narrow minor groove; these are intrinsic features of dA tracts (reviewed in [44]) that are presumably recognized by IHF. On the right-hand side of the complex, the DNA backbone is directly coordinated by protein sidechains including that of Arg46 in the 1­ 2 loop of the subunit, which contacts all three conserved bases at the 3 end of the binding site (Fig. 2). The snug fit of IHF in the minor groove and the pattern of electrostatic interactions with the bases suggest that IHF prefers these sequences because of the local conformation of the minor groove, in part resulting from a dearth of guanines with their bulky N2 amino groups. IHF has a remarkable economy of form considering the magnitude of the DNA bend it produces. Flexible arms that disrupt base-pair stacking and induce kinks in the DNA, combined with a rigid helical core that anchors the DNA on either side of the bend, create the DNA equivalent of a -hairpin turn in proteins. The IHF crystal structure also provides a new perspective on site-specific recognition of the DNA minor groove, opening the way for more detailed functional comparisons with HU and other nonspecific DNA-bending proteins.
