Abstract Tryptases, the predominant proteins of human mast cells, have been implicated as pathogenetic mediators of allergic and inflammatory conditions, most notably asthma. Until recently, the fascinating properties that distinguish tryptases among the serine proteinases, particularly their activity as a heparin-stabilized tetramer, resistance to most proteinaceous inhibitors, and preference for peptidergic over macromolecular substrates presented a riddle. This review solves this riddle with the help of the crystal structure of the human L2 -tryptase tetramer, but also indicates controversies between the unique quaternary architecture and some experimental data. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction The activity of serine proteinases within mast cells was ¢rst detected using enzyme-histochemical techniques more than 40 years ago [1^3]. These histochemical studies already established many of the common and characteristic features of the mast cell proteinases named chymase and tryptase by Laguno¡ and Benditt [4]: their localization in mast cells, their activity inside secretory granules and inferred lack of a lasting zymogen, and their chymotrypsinand trypsin-like speci¢city, respectively. In addition,

remarkable variations were observed both between tissues and species. The exceptionally large amounts of proteinases within mast cells and the ubiquitous but unobtrusive presence of these cells within tissues made it inevitable that chymases and tryptases were isolated from various sources, complicating their initial characterization (for a recollection of their history see [5]). Richard Woodbury from Hans Neurath's group identi¢ed mast cells as the source of two `group speci¢c proteinases' initially isolated by Nobuhiko Katunuma et al. [6,7] from rat skeletal muscle and small intestine, and demonstrated their identity with rat chymases 1 and 2 ( = rat mast cell proteinases I and II, RMCPI and RMCPII) [8^11]. Thus, the covalent structure of the `group speci¢c proteinase' from rat intestine clari¢ed by Woodbury and Katunuma in

Neurath's laboratory [12] is in fact the ¢rst one of a mast cell proteinase, i.e. rat chymase 2. Both rat chymases were already crystallized in 1978 [12,13], the three-dimensional structure of chymase 2 solved in the 80s [14], and recently also the structure of human chymase has been determined [15,16]. Based on a high degree of identity in sequence and numerous similarities in chemical and enzymatic properties Neurath and coworkers suggested that the rat chymases 1 and 2 together with human neutrophil cathepsin G (whose sequence was provided by Jim Travis) may have followed a common evolutionary pathway which has led to a group of serine proteinases distinct from their pancreatic ancestors [17]. This group of proteinases, the `granule-associated serine proteinase of hematopoietic cells', is now known to also comprise mast cell tryptases, neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3, the lymphocyte granzymes, and the enzymatically inactive azurocidin. Most likely, some additional members have yet to be identi¢ed; for example, a recent systematic cloning study has demonstrated the expression of seven chymases and two tryptases in rat mast cells [18]. In addition to the chymases and the minute amounts of tryptases present in rat mast cells [19,20], Everitt and Neurath identi¢ed and sequenced a third type of protease, a metallo-carboxypeptidase [21,22]. Based on its carboxypeptidase A-like activity they pointed out the synergistic activity of both proteases, with chymase cleaving substrates C-terminally of hydrophobic residues which can subsequently be removed by mast cell carboxypeptidase. This synergy is enhanced by the close spatial relationship of mast cell carboxypeptidase with chymase 1 which are both tightly bound in enzymatically active form inside the relatively insoluble matrix of rat mast cells granules [22,23]. 2. Human mast cell tryptases In contrast to the chymases of rat mast cells, tryptases are the predominant proteases of human mast cells. With 10^35 pg per mast cell, tryptases represent up to 25% of the total protein content of the cell and 90% of their secretory granules [24,25]. Chymase, cathepsin G (which would probably have been called a chymase if ¢rst identi¢ed in mast cells rather than

neutrophils) [26,27] and carboxypeptidase A [28] are present only in a subset of human mast cells. The two primary mast cell subtypes thus de¢ned, MCT and MCTC , are distributed in a tissue-speci¢c manner, with MCT predominantly located in the alveolar tissue and the intestinal mucosa while MCTC predominate in the skin, the small intestinal submucosa, and the conjunctiva [25,29]. The relevance of a third mast cell subset (MCC ) which appears to contain only chymase and carboxypeptidase [30,31] remains to be con¢rmed. Human tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteinases that are derived from t3 nonallelic genes clustered on chromosome 16p13.3 [32]. Eight isoenzymes (K1 , K2 , L1a , L1b , L2 , L3 , mMCP-7like-1, mMCP-7-like-2) have been identi¢ed by sequencing of the genes and cDNAs derived from human lung [33,34] and skin tissues [35]. Based on the analysis of two human bacterial arti¢cial chromosome clones the isoenzymes L2 and L3 , L1 and K2 , as well as the two mMCP-7-like genes, may be alleles at single loci [32]. L-Tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in human lung and skin mast cells whereas in basophils K-tryptases predominate [36]. The expression of the two mMCP-7-like genes, of which one contains a premature stop codon and the other is not yet completely sequenced, still needs to be surveyed. The deduced amino acids sequences of the mature L tryptase monomers are very similar (75 amino acid di¡erence) whereas the K and mMCP-7-like tryptases are less closely related (93% and 87% identity in sequence for K1 and mMCP-7-like-2 to L1a , respectively). Both the K and mMCP-7-like isoenzymes di¡er from the L-tryptases at amino acid position 33; it has been proposed that this Arg33 to Gln33 substitution may hinder the autolytic trimming of the propeptide by hydrolysis at the basic residue and the subsequent activation to the mature protease by dipeptidyl peptidase I (cathepsin C), resulting in a constitutive secretion of the zymogen [37]. This hypothesis is supported by the identi¢cation of K-tryptase by immunoassays as the predominant tryptase at baseline in the blood of normal subjects [38], whereas L-tryptases appear to be the major type stored in mast cell secretory granules. L-Tryptases also are the major isoenzymes isolated from lung and skin tissues; whether the heterogene-

ity of all preparations in size and of some in reaction with synthetic and natural substrates [39^41] is due to di¡erent isoenzymes remains to be clari¢ed. Because the isoenzyme composition of isolated tryptases used in various studies is usually not known, such preparations as well as recombinant L-tryptases [42^44] will subsequently collectively be referred to as `tryptase'. Upon mast cell activation, tryptase is secreted together with heparin and histamine into the extracellular space. A rapidly increasing number of studies have demonstrated elevated levels of tryptase in various body £uids after anaphylactic reactions and in diverse allergic and in£ammatory disorders including asthma, rhinitis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and interstitial cystitis. Interest has particularly been focused on asthma; studies with isolated tissues and in animal models in vivo, apparent genetic links of tryptases to airway reactivity, and ¢rst clinical trials with a synthetic tryptase inhibitor have provided considerable evidence that tryptases are directly involved in the pathogenesis of airway hyperreactivity and in£ammation [45^50]. Despite signi¢cant sequence similarity with other trypsin-like serine proteinases, human tryptase possesses unique properties that were poorly understood until recently. Most notable, tryptases are enzymatically active in the form of a non-covalently linked heparin-stabilized tetramer, resistant to most proteinaceous inhibitors, and display an unusual substrate speci¢city with a preference for peptidergic over macromolecular substrates (see below for details). These î distinguishing features are well explained by the 3 A crystal structure of the human lung L2 -tryptase tetramer in complex with the inhibitor 4-amidinophenylpyruvic acid (APPA) that has been solved recently [51,52]. Here, we will review the biochemical and enzymatic properties of human tryptase, relate them to the tryptase structure, and propose mechanisms for the interaction with some substrates and inhibitors which have been controversial. 3. Structure of the tryptase tetramer The crystal structure of the tryptase tetramer shows that the monomers do not form a compact tetrahedral body presumed in most schematic tryp-

tase models published so far. Rather, the monomers (arbitrarily assigned A, B, C, and D in Fig. 1a) are positioned at the corners of a £at rectangular frame with the four active sites facing a continuous central pore. Obviously, such an architecture could not be predicted by models of tryptases based on monomeric proteinases [53,54]. The tetramer displays almost perfect 222 symmetry; the three 2-fold axes cross each other nearly exactly perpendicular in the center of the tetramer and relate the monomer pairs AD to BC, AB to DC, and AB to CD, respectively. The symmetry, however, is not exact due to the slightly di¡erent environment of each monomer in the crystal and particularly due to the non-equivalent conformations of the Tyr75 side chains located in the A-B and C-D interfaces (see below). Therefore, monomer A is equivalent only to C and monomer B to D. The tryptase monomer is surprisingly similar in fold to the archetypal serine proteinases trypsin and chymotrypsin: of the 245 amino acid residues of the monomer 168 and 162 are topologically equivalent to those of trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively, with î a rms deviation of the K-carbon atoms of only 0.65 A for both comparisons. However, six surface loops di¡er fundamentally in conformation and partially in length from those of other trypsin-like proteinases (Fig. 2). Most of the 15 and 22 additional amino acid residues of tryptase compared to the B-chains of chymotrypsin and trypsin, respectively, are inserted in these loops, i.e. the 147-loop including the 152`spur' (+1 residue compared to chymotrypsin), the 37-loop (+2), the 60-loop (+5), and the 173-loop (+9), while the 97-loop is identical in length and the 70^80-loop three residues shorter. These six loops which deviate most from the archetypal proteinases are located around the active site, and border and shape the active site cleft. Moreover, they realize all monomer-monomer contacts within the tetramer via two distinct interfaces, which appears to be the main reason for their unusual conformation. 4. Stability and activity of the tetramer Each of the tryptase monomers interacts with its two neighbors via contacts which di¡er considerably in size and quality. Monomers A and D interact with

(a) Front view. The four monomers (arbitrarily labeled A to D) are arranged at the corners of a frame-like structure. The four active sites are directed towards the central pore. Two of the four inhibitor molecules 4-amidinophenylpyruvic acid (APPA; yellow) are visible while the other two are hidden behind protruding £aps (i.e. the 147 loops; see Fig. 2 for loop arrangement) which project from each of the monomers but on alternating sides and partially occlude the entrances to the central pore. (b) Side view towards the AB homodimer. The patches of positively charged residues (blue) on the periphery of the AB dimer (and the corresponding CD dimer) extend towards the back side of monomer A and the front side of monomer B (see a). They provide a potential binding site for heparin chains which can span and thus stabilize the interface between monomers A and B. (c) Top view onto the AD homodimer. On the peripheral surface of the AD (and the corresponding BC) dimer positive charges are counterbalanced by adjacent negative ones. The interface between monomers A and D is much larger in size than the AB interface so that the dimer appears as one solid block. (d) The tryptase monomer in standard orientation, i.e. as seen from the middle of the central pore toward the active site of monomer A. The active site cleft runs approximately horizontally across the molecular surface facing the viewer, and would bind substrates extending from left to right. Negatively charged residues are clustered around the active site that is indicated by the APPA molecule (yellow). These residues confer the inner pore-facing surface of the monomer a quite negative electrostatic potential (see also a) and may provide secondary interactions with basic substrates and inhibitors.

Fig. 2. Stick representation of the tryptase tetramer. The six loops that di¡er most from the archetypal serine proteinases and realize the monomer-monomer contacts are shown in special colors, i.e. the 147-loop including the 152-`spur' (green), the 70^80-loop (yellow), the 37-loop (red), the 60-loop (blue), the 97-loop (magenta), and the 173-£ap (turquoise). The catalytic triad residues Ser195, His57, and Asp102 are shown in orange. The 147-loop protrudes from each of the monomers towards the central pore, partially obstructing its entrances.

one another through their entire northern rims, each consisting of the 173-£ap, the 97-loop, and the 60loop (Fig. 2). The contact surface area of this interface (and the equivalent B-C contact) is almost twice î as large as the A-B interface with sizes of 1075 A2 î 2 , respectively. In addition, it comprises a and 540 A number of hydrophobic contacts as well as salt bridges between Asp60B and Arg224, and is further stabilized by four hydrogen bonds involving both main and side chains. Monomers A and B interact with one another through the 147-loop, the 70^80-loop, and the 37loop, again via equivalent loops. This A-B and the corresponding C-D interface appear much more fragile; besides being considerably smaller than the A-D

interface (see the `waistline' in Fig. 1b compared to Fig. 1c) this interface is exclusively hydrophobic in nature, with a remarkable number of tyrosine and proline residues involved, and lacks any stabilizing hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Furthermore, the asymmetric conformation of the phenolic groups of the two Tyr75 residues (which would clash with each other if arranged in a symmetrical manner) and the charges of the two Arg150 residues opposing each other presumably make unfavorable contributions to this interface. These small and exclusively hydrophobic A-B and C-D interfaces seem to be built-in shear points of the tryptase tetramer. It appears likely that the high salt concentrations known to stabilize the tetramer in vi-

tro [55,56] primarily strengthen the hydrophobic interactions and weaken the electrostatic arginine/arginine repulsion within this interface. In vivo, the tetramer is secreted by mast cells bound predominantly to heparin proteoglycans [57,58]; such acidic polysaccharides may stabilize the tetramer by binding to a number of positively charged residues which are clustered on both sides of the interface and form an obliquely oriented bilobal patch on the peripheral surface that extends to one of the front sides of each monomer (Fig. 1b). The length of an extended heparin glycosaminoglycan chain required to î span the interface (approx. 100 A = approx. 20 sugar residues) is in good agreement with the minimal molecular mass of approx. 5.500 Da of heparin required for the stabilization [56]. In the absence of stabilizing glycosaminoglycans or high salt concentrations the enzymatically active tetramer rapidly disintegrates into monomers which are catalytically virtually inactive [55,56,59,60]. This spontaneous inactivation is a complex multi-step process which may involve transient reversible intermediates and is accompanied by conformational changes consistent with the conversion of the active site to a zymogen-like structure [61^63]. Complete reactivation can occur at acidic pH, again a multistep process apparently involving dimerization of monomers, rapid formation of inactive tetramers, and subsequent slow formation of active tetramers [64]. Structural features support the hypothesis that upon tetramer dissociation the monomers undergo transformation from an active conformation stabilized by inter-monomer contacts into a zymogenlike conformation that is favored due to intra-monomer interactions. In the enzymatically active tetramer, the N-terminal Ile16 residue of each monomer is inserted into the Ile16 pocket and forms a solvent inaccessible salt bridge between its free Ile16 K-amino group and the carboxylate group of Asp194. This salt bridge is found in virtually all mature trypsinlike proteinases and is required for the formation of a functional substrate recognition site and thus the activity of the proteinase [65,66]. In the tryptase monomer a second acidic anchoring point, composed of residues Asp143, Asp145 and Asp147, is close to the Ile16 cleft and may compete with Asp194 for the binding of the N-terminal Ile16 K-amino group,

thereby destabilizing the active and favoring a zymogen-like conformation. In addition, the zymogen triad residues His40 and Ser32 will stabilize the zymogen state. In the tetramer, however, the insertion of the Ile16 amino terminus into its pocket is probably supported by the conformation of the 173-loop held in place by the AD-type inter-monomer contact; similarly, binding of tissue factor to the 173-loop of activated factor VIIa B-chain is believed to support insertion of the N-terminal Ile16 [67,68], resulting in a dramatically enhanced activity. 5. Interaction with substrates and receptors Tryptase di¡ers from all other serine proteinases as its substrate speci¢city is governed by the quaternary architecture rather than the structure of the active site. In this respect the tetramer can be considered to be a new member of the `self-compartmentalizing proteases', a small group of proteolytic enzymes that form compartments through self-association and segregate their proteolytic active sites to the interior of these compartments [69]. Consisting of only one ring composed of four identical subunits and with a molecular mass of approx. 135 kDa tryptase is smaller than the other members of this group which form structures ranging from two rings with three identical subunits each (e.g. Gal6 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the tricorn protease from Thermoplasma acidophilum with a molecular mass of 300 and 720 kDa, respectively) to four rings with seven di¡erent subunits as the eukaryotic proteasome (molecular mass 750 kDa). Also, the other self-compartmentalizing proteases are localized in the cytosol and represent the main agents of intracellular protein breakdown whereas the predominant actions of tryptase are thought to occur in the extracellular space after its release by mast cell degranulation. The active site of the tryptase monomer is very similar in structure to that of trypsin and not suitable to confer speci¢city. In particular, the S1 speci¢city pocket is nearly identical to that of trypsin and well suited to accommodate both P1 arginine and lysine residues. The S2 subsite is open and larger than that of trypsin, and the S3/S4 subsite is fully blocked. On the carboxy-terminal site binding of extended substrate chains is limited to about P5P by the neighbor-

ing monomer (i.e. monomer B in respect to monomer A). These structural considerations are in good agreement with studies using peptide substrates to map the subsite speci¢city of human lung tryptase that have suggested an extended substrate-binding site but also showed that both amino acid thioesters and most dipeptide thioesters are cleaved with similar e¤ciency [39]. The access to the four active sites of the tetramer, however, is severely limited as they are directed towards its central pore. The cross-section of this pore is almost rectangular but twisted by approx. 30³ about the tetramer axis. In its central part it has a î size of approx. 50U25 A but both entrances are î narrower (approx. 40U15 A) because they are partially occluded by the 147 loops which project from each of the monomers on alternating sides. The entrances of the central pore are thus just large enough for elongated peptides of the diameter of an K-helix to thread through and to interact with the active sites. Indeed, tryptase has considerable activity on peptidergic substrates such as the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the related peptide histidine methionine (PHM) [70,71] as well as the peptide hormones vasopressin and kinetensin [72,73]. In particular, vasoactive intestinal peptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide are hydrolyzed at several sites with favorable overall rates (kcat /Km of 1.5U105 and 2.7U105 M31 s31 , respectively [70]). Despite potential tryptic cleavage sites the tachykinins substance P and neurokinin A as well as neurotensin are not cleaved [70,73], indicating that an arginine or lysine residue and a limited size alone are not su¤cient prerequisites for a polypeptide to be recognized as a tryptase substrate. The inactivation of the bronchodilating peptides VIP and PHM, and of the vasodilator/bronchoconstrictor CGRP, has been proposed as a mechanism by which tryptase enhances bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients and contributes to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The cleavage of neuropeptides by tryptase may be particularly relevant due to the close anatomic association of mast cells with nerve ¢bers both in lung and skin and the ability of neuropeptides to induce degranulation of some mast cell subtypes (for review see [74]). In contrast to peptidergic substrates larger pro-

teins do not ¢t easily into the central pore of the tetramer to gain access to the active sites, a fact re£ected by the limited number of macromolecular substrates that have been identi¢ed. In order to interact with an active site, proteinaceous substrates î must extend a cleavable surface loop of s 20 A into the central pore. Such protrusions may be extracted from the substrate's structure during its interaction with the tryptase tetramer; docking studies with models of prostromelysin (MMP-3) and the zymogen of urinary type plasminogen activator that are known to be activated by tryptase [75,76] suggest that the activation cleavage loops of these zymogens could otherwise not bind to an active center within the tetramer. This extraction process may be facilitated by the negatively charged amino acid residues which cluster on the inner pore-facing surface, conferring the pore with a quite negative electrostatic potential and favoring secondary interactions with basic substrates such as histones [77]. The size limitations imposed on substrates by the central pore's geometry are also re£ected in the interaction of tryptase with kininogens. Initial studies suggested that tryptase neither releases kinins from LMW- or HMW-kininogen nor activates urinary or plasma prekallikrein, but destroys the procoagulant activity of HMW-kininogen [40,78^81]. More recently, however, tryptase was shown to activate the kallikrein-kinin system through prekallikrein activation [82]. Moreover, Kozik et al. demonstrated that tryptase rapidly releases bradykinin from kininogens but only in the presence of neutrophil elastase [83]. Clearly, the kininogen fragments produced by elastase (as well as a peptide analogue which also is rapidly cleaved) are small enough to enter the central pore of the tryptase tetramer where they may even dock to adjacent active sites so that the nonapeptide bradykinin can be excised by (quasi)simultaneous cleavages. Tryptase has been shown to cleave both the K and L chain of ¢brinogen, rendering it unclottable by thrombin and destroying the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence motif recognized by cell surface KV L3 integrins, thereby reducing its binding to endothelial cells [77,84]. Surprisingly, tryptase hydrolyzes ¢brinogen both in the presence and absence of heparin, yielding di¡erent products [85]. Moreover, although the activity of tryptase towards most substrates is maximal at

82

neutral pH, ¢brinolysis appears to be optimal at acidic pH [86] similar to the kininogenase activity of tryptase observed in one study [87]. Such acidic conditions also favor the intermolecular autoprocessing of L-protryptases, suggesting optimal catalytic activity of the zymogen [37], and the re-association of the zymogen-like monomers to the tetramer [64]. In light of these studies and the restricted access to the active sites of the tetramer it should be reconsidered whether some of the observed cleavages of macromolecular proteins such as ¢brinogen, ¢bronectin [88] or even intact type VI collagen micro¢brils [89] are due to tryptase monomers rather than the tetramer. Such monomers, which due to the non-covalent nature of the tetramer are likely to be present in all tryptase preparations, have some residual activity [59] and probably broad trypsin-like speci¢city (see above). In addition to soluble substrates tryptase cleaves the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) [43,90^92], a member of a growing group of G protein-coupled, seven transmembrane domain cell surface receptors that are activated by a proteolytic mechanism. The activation cleavage site (Arg36-Ser37) in the N-terminal extracellular domain of PAR-2 is located approx. 40 amino acid residues upstream from the predicted ¢rst transmembrane segment and thus is at su¤cient distance from the cell membrane to interact with an active site of the tryptase tetramer. Tryptaseinduced activation of PAR-2 elicits transient cytosolic Ca2 mobilization in colonic myocytes, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells [91^93]. It remains to be determined which of the diverse cellular e¡ects of tryptase are mediated by PAR-2; based on indirect evidence, however, tryptase like trypsin [94] activates di¡erent cells by both PAR-2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. 6. Interaction with synthetic inhibitors Human tryptase is inhibited by the common low molecular weight inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteinases including diisopropyl £uorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl £uoride, and tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, as well as by leupeptin and antipain, peptide-arginine aldehydes of microbial origin. Clearly, the size of the tetramer's central pore

does not hinder the binding of such small compounds to an active site. Various approaches have been utilized to synthesize more selective inhibitors; in particular, a number of (quasi)symmetric, dibasic tryptase inhibitors such as bis-benzamidines have been identi¢ed [48,95^97]. The smaller of these compounds, e.g. pentamidine, are likely to gain a¤nity by binding with their distal basic group to the negative charge cluster composed of Asp143, Asp145, and Asp147. Although it has been reported that both small and larger dibasic inhibitors bind to tryptase with a stoichiometry of one inhibitor molecule per active site [48], based on the tryptase structure we believe that larger compounds with sca¡olds in the î range of 20 A in length simultaneously interact with the active sites of adjacent monomers which are spaî tially close (e.g. approx. 23 A distance for the active sites of monomers A and D). The high a¤nity of bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane (BABIM) and analogues [96,98] for tryptase and other trypsin-like proteinases, however, is due to a di¡erent mechanism: a zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated between two chelating nitrogen atoms of BABIM and the two active site residues His57 and Ser195 [98]. The increased a¤nity in the presence of suitable zinc concentrations is not limited to tryptase but shared by other trypsin-like proteinases (Ki of BABIM in the presence of zinc 6 nM, 1 nM, 23 nM, and 90 nM for tryptase, factor Xa, thrombin, and trypsin, respectively [98]). 7. Interaction with proteinaceous inhibitors Human tryptase is virtually unique among the serine proteinases as it is resistant to most proteinaceous inhibitors and fully catalytically active in plasma and the extracellular space [55,57]. Obviously, this resistance is due to the restricted accessibility of such proteins to the active sites imposed by the geometry of the central pore. Most proteinaceous inhibitors known not to a¡ect the activity of tryptase, e.g. the serpins K1 -proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin III and C1-esterase inhibitor as well as K2 -macroglobulin [55,99], are far too bulky to ¢t into the central pore and gain access to one of the active centers. Modeling experiments suggest that even the smaller Kunitz-type and classical Kazal-

Fig. 3. Inhibition of human tryptase by LDTI. (a) At nanomolar concentrations LDTI inhibits the cleavage of small chromogenic substrates (e.g., tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-para-nitroanilide) maximally by approx. 50%. The association can be approximated as a tight-binding inhibition of two of the four active sites of the tryptase tetramer with an equilibrium dissociation constant Ki of approx. 1.4 nM for the complex. (b) In a wider range of concentration LDTI inhibits the amidolytic activity of tryptase with multiphasic kinetics. Scatchard plot analysis of the inhibition curves suggests binding to two sites with a Ki of approx. 1.8 nM and to two additional sites with a Ki of approx. 560 nM and 10 000 nM, respectively.

type inhibitors (see below) cannot bind to the active site of a monomer because their distal poles would collide with the adjacent monomers, particular with the 147-loops, explaining the observed inactivity of e.g. bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (aprotinin) and the Kunitz domain of the Alzheimer L-amyloid precursor protein. In this respect human tryptase differs from tryptases of some other species which are co-localized and inhibited by endogenous Kunitztype inhibitors, e.g. bovine tryptase by aprotinin [100] and rat tryptase by trypstatin, which appears to be a fragment of the inter-K-trypsin inhibitor light chain [101,102]. These di¡erences may suggest that the geometry of the central pore of the human tryptase tetramer di¡ers from those of other species. Controversial data have been reported whether or not human tryptase is inhibited by the mucus proteinase inhibitor (MPI; secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor = SLPI; antileukoprotease = ALP; human urinary secretory inhibitor-1 = HUSI-1) [103], a major serine proteinase inhibitor produced by mucosal epithelial cells, serous cells, and bronchiolar goblet cells in human airways. Thus, Wright et al. recently reported that MPI inhibits tryptase with an equilibrium dissociation constant Ki of 0.58 nM for the complex [104] whereas Alter et al. [99] and we could not detect any signi¢cant inhibition. Modeling experiments with the structure of MPI [105] clearly show that this two domain inhibitor (11.7 kDa) is

too large to bind to an active site of the tryptase tetramer with its inhibitorily active second domain. Moreover, even ela¢n ( = skin-derived antileukoprotease, SKALP), a smaller protein corresponding to the second domain of MPI [106], should not be able to interact with the active sites of the tryptase tetramer. 8. Destabilization of the enzymatically active tetramer The activity of human tryptase in vivo appears to be solely regulated by the stability of the heparinstabilized enzymatically active tetramer and its dissociation into inactive monomers. Potentially MPI, a basic protein (15 lysine and ¢ve arginine residues, pI s 9) which forms tight complexes with heparin (Kd 6 þ 2 nM) [107] inhibits tryptase in a fashion similar to antithrombin III, lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase which compete with tryptase for the binding of heparin and thus destabilize the enzymatically active tetramer in vitro [99,108,109]. Also other cationic proteins which avidly bind heparin such as protamine or histones may `inhibit' tryptase by a similar mechanism; indeed histones were shown to be non-competitive inhibitors of bovine tryptase in vitro [110]. The relevance of such studies where heparin glycosaminoglycans and puri¢ed tryptases are used rather than the proteoglycan-tryptase complex secreted by mast

cells [57,58] remains to be determined; in particular, the observed apparent inhibition constants (e.g. Ki P 24 nM for lactoferrin; IC50 16 nM for myeloperoxidase [108,109]) will depend largely on the nature and the concentration of the aminoglycan used to stabilize tryptase. Both lactoferrin and MPI have been shown to block antigen-induced pulmonary responses in guinea pig and sheep models of allergic asthma [104,108,111]; whether these e¡ects are indeed due to destabilization of an endogenous tryptase needs to be veri¢ed, because the heparin dependence of tryptases from di¡erent species varies considerably, and particularly in sheep only `mast cell proteinase 1', a monomeric proteinase with dual tryptase- and chymase-like properties, has been identi¢ed so far [112]. 9. LDTI, a potent tryptase inhibitor from the medical leech The only active site-directed proteinaceous inhibitor known for human tryptase is LDTI (leech-derived tryptase inhibitor), a small `atypical' Kazaltype inhibitor (46 amino acid residues, molecular mass 4738 Da) isolated from the medical leech Hirudo medicinalis [113]. Both native and recombinant LDTI [114,115] are competitive and reversible inhibitors of human tryptase. Their interaction, however, follows unusual multiphasic kinetics (Fig. 3) similar to those observed for the interaction of bovine tryptase with its endogenous inhibitor aprotinin [116]: at nanomolar concentrations LDTI reduces the cleav-

age of chromogenic peptide substrates maximally by approx. 50%, a phenomenon that can be approximated as a tight-binding inhibition of two active sites of the tryptase tetramer with a Ki of approx. 1.4 nM. At higher concentrations LDTI binds to two additional sites with Ki values of approx. 560 nM and 10 000 nM, respectively. Remarkably, the degree of tryptase inhibition by LDTI depends on the size of the substrate: nanomolar concentrations of LDTI reduce the cleavage of chromogenic tripeptides, VIP, and PHM maximally by approx. 50%, approx. 66%, and approx. 75%, respectively. The breakdown of larger proteins such as HMW-kininogen and cellular e¡ects of tryptase, e.g. the proliferation of ¢broblasts and keratinocytes, are completely inhibited with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Besides tryptase LDTI inhibits trypsin and chymotrypsin, showing `usual' tight-binding kinetics and no substrate dependency (Ki 0.9 nM and 20 nM, respectively). LDTI is a Kazal-type inhibitor but belongs to a small subgroup that is `atypical' in respect to the cysteine positioning. So far only ¢ve `atypical' Kazal-type inhibitors are known which have all been identi¢ed in blood-sucking ectoparasites (Fig. 4), i.e. Bdellin B3 and bdellin KL, trypsin and plasmin inhibitors from the medical leech and Hirudo nipponia [117,118], and the thrombin inhibitors rhodniin [119] and dipetalogastin from the assassin bugs Rhodnius prolixus and Dipetalogaster maximus, vectors of Chagas' disease. To clarify the structural consequences of the atypical cysteine positioning and to built a `mirror image' of the active site of tryptase,

Fig. 4. Amino acid sequence alignment of the known `non-classical' Kazal-type inhibitors. The amino acid sequence of LDTI [113] was aligned with bdellin B3 [117], bdellin KL [118], the inhibitorily active domain 1 of rhodniin [119], and the ¢fth of six domains of dipetalogastin (Mende et al., SWISS-Prot/TrEMBL entry O96790). For comparison, the sequence of a classical Kazal-type inhibitor, the third domain of the ovomucoid of the silver pheasant, is given. Residues common to LDTI are boxed, gaps indicated by dashes and cysteines by shadowing. The arrowhead marks the reactive site bond. The secondary structural elements are derived from the crystal structure of LDTI [97].

Fig. 5. Models of the interaction of the tryptase tetramer with Kazal-type inhibitors. (a) A molecule of the `atypical' Kazal-type inhibitor LDTI (red) is docked into the active site of monomer A of the tryptase tetramer (shown in turquoise ribbons) in a fashion as it binds to bovine trypsin in the LDTI/trypsin complex [97]. A second LDTI molecule can bind to the active site of either monomer B or C, thereby nearly ¢lling the space in the central pore. (b) Docking of a `classical' Kazal-type, i.e. the N-terminally shortened Lys18 variant of the turkey ovomucoid third domain (Ding et al., PDB entry 1HJA) indicates collisions with the neighboring monomer D, particularly the 147-loop, explaining the lack of inhibition observed experimentally.

the solution structure of LDTI [120] and the crystal structure in complex with bovine trypsin [97,121] were determined. The structures verify that LDTI exhibits the overall fold and the exposed `canonical' binding loop conserved among Kazal-type inhibitors. Due to the atypical cysteine spacing LDTI di¡ers from the `classical' members of this family (e.g. ovomucoids) in the length of the central helix and the position of the N-terminus. Docking experiments indicate that the very compact tertiary structure of LDTI is a key determinant allowing its interaction with the tryptase tetramer (Fig. 5a). If modeled to the active site of tryptase monomer A in a fashion as it binds to bovine trypsin, LDTI just ¢ts into the central pore of the tryptase tetramer, with only minor contacts of its distal part with the 147-loop of the opposing monomer D. The two amino-terminal lysine residues of LDTI are spatially close to the carboxylate groups of Asp143 and Asp147 of monomer A and also to Asp60B of monomer D; the involvement of such electrostatic

interactions is supported by deleterious e¡ects of deletions and substitutions of these N-terminal residues on the a¤nity of LDTI towards tryptase but not trypsin or chymotrypsin [97]. Due to the limited space within the central pore docking of a second LDTI molecule is possible only at the active site of either at monomer B or C, explaining both the approx. 50% inhibition at nanomolar LDTI concentrations and the dependence of the degree of inhibition on the size of the substrate. Binding of an additional LDTI molecule to an active sites would require major distortions of the tetramer; most likely the third and fourth LDTI molecules shown to bind to tryptase interact with other sites of the tetramer, e.g. the acidic rim of the central pore, and thus obstruct the entrance to the central pore. Analogous docking experiments with the more elongated classical Kazal-type inhibitors (Fig. 5b) and rhodniin indicate major collisions of their distal poles with the neighboring monomers D and B, particularly with the 147-loop. Indeed, various Kazal-

type inhibitors tested (e.g. human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, the third domain of the Japanese quail ovomucoid, Arg18 and Lys18 variants of the turkey ovomucoid third domain, and rhodniin) do not inhibit tryptase even at micromolar concentrations although their reactive site sequences are similar to that of LDTI. On the other hand, an `atypical' cysteine spacing is not su¤cient to inhibit the tryptase tetramer, as neither Bdellin B3 nor Bdellin KL inhibits tryptase. Interestingly, the medical leech also contains inhibitors directed against all other human mast cell proteinases: in addition to eglin C, a potent inhibtor of chymase and cathepsin G [122], we have identi¢ed hirustasin, another cathepsin G inhibitor [123,124] and LCI, a metallo-carboxypeptidase inhibitor [125]. The human protein most closely related in sequence to LDTI is LEKTI, a multimeric Kazaltype inhibitor cloned recently [126]; in particular, LDTI and domain 15 of LEKTI share the reactive site sequence CPK(I/D)LKPVC (P3^P6P). Thirteen of the predicted 15 domains of LEKTI lack the third and the sixth cysteine residues and thus the disul¢de bridge ¢xing the C-terminus to the core of other Kazal-type inhibitors. Potentially, the resulting distorted Kazal-like structure may ¢t into the central pore of the tryptase tetramer to allow binding to one or more of its active sites. 10. Conclusions In summary, many of the unique features of tryptases that presented a riddle until recently are well explained by the structure of the L2 -tryptase tetramer which shows a frame-like architecture segregating the proteolytic active sites to the interior of a central pore. Tryptase is enzymatically active only as a tetramer because the active conformation of its monomers is stabilized by contacts with their neighbors although a zymogen-like conformation is favored by intra-monomer interactions. The tetramer is stabilized by heparin chains larger than approx. 20 sugar residues, a length required to bridge the weaker of the two distinct monomer-monomer interfaces; this interface, which is exclusively hydrophobic in nature, can alternatively be strengthened by high salt concentrations in vitro. Finally, the unusual preference

for peptidergic over macromolecular substrates and the resistance to proteinaceous inhibitors other than LDTI result from the limited accessibility of the active sites within the central pore of the tetramer. Discrepancies do exist between the obvious consequences of the tetramer's architecture and some proposed biochemical and enzymatic properties of human tryptase. These discrepancies predominate in areas of research where controversial experimental data have been obtained. For example, based on the structure MPI/SLPI is clearly too large to gain access to an active site; however, tryptase was both reported to be inhibited and to be resistant to MPI. Potentially, MPI, which binds heparin avidly, competes with tryptase for stabilizing glycosaminoglycans and thus disrupts the active tetramer, an e¡ect largely dependent on experimental conditions. Also, some proteins proposed as tryptase substrates appear far too large to be cleaved by the active sites within the tetramer; interestingly, hydrolysis of such proteins has been reported at unusual conditions, i.e. in the absence of heparin or at an acidic pH. Potentially, such proteins are cleaved by tryptase monomers which presumably have some residual activity with broad trypsin-like speci¢city. Finally, the detailed knowledge of the active centers and their positioning within the tetramer aids the rational design of both mono- and multi-functional inhibitors. In particular, inhibitors that bind to more than one active site will ideally have potentiated af¢nity, conferring selectivity for the tryptase tetramer. Besides having therapeutic potential in asthma and other mast cell-related disorders such inhibitors are perfect cheats to obtain missing links in `the riddle of the mast cell' [127].
