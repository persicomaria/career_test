Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus catalyses the oxidative ring expansion of the penicillin nucleus into the nucleus of cephalosporins. The reaction requires dioxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as co-substrates to create a reactive iron­oxygen intermediate from a ferrous iron in the active site. The active enzyme is monomeric in solution. The structure of DAOCS was determined earlier from merohedrally twinned crystals where the last four C-terminal residues (308­311) of one molecule penetrate the active site of a neighbouring molecule, creating a cyclic trimeric structure in the crystal. Shortening the polypeptide chain from the C terminus by more than four residues diminishes activity. Here, we describe a new crystal form of DAOCS in which trimer formation is broken and the C-terminal arm is free. These crystals show no signs of twinning, and were obtained from DAOCS labelled with an N-terminal His-tag. The modified DAOCS is catalytically active. The free C-terminal arm protrudes into the solvent, and the C-terminal domain (residues 268­ 299) is rotated by about 168 towards the active site. The last 12 residues (300­311) are disordered. Structures for various enzyme­substrate and enzyme­product complexes in the new crystal form confirm overlapping binding sites for penicillin and 2-oxoglutarate. The results support the notion that 2-oxoglutarate and dioxygen need to react first to produce an oxidizing iron species, followed by reaction with the penicillin substrate. The position of the penicillin nucleus is topologically similar in the two crystal forms, but the penicillin side-chain in the new non-twinned crystals overlaps with the position of residues 304­306 of the C-terminal arm in the twinned crystals. An analysis of the interactions between the C-terminal region and residues in the active site indicates that DAOCS could also accept polypeptide chains as ligands, and these could bind near the iron.

Conformational Flexibility in DAOCS

Introduction
All medicinally used penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics are produced from fermentationderived materials. The failure to develop viable synthetic procedures for the preparation of these antibiotics severely limits the development of novel antibiotics of this class. At the same time it has increased interest in understanding the biosynthetic pathways employed by the microorganisms that produce them. Unconventional steps (Figure 1) in the biosynthesis of penicillins and cephalosporins are catalysed by two mononuclear ferrous enzymes: isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS)1,2 creates from a linear tripeptide the bicyclic core of the penicillins; and deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS)3,4 expands the five-membered thiazolidine ring of the penicillin nucleus into the six-membered dihydrothiazine ring of the cephalosporin nucleus.5,6 Both enzymes use dioxygen-derived iron intermediates in catalysis, but in contrast to IPNS, the oxidising iron species of DAOCS is produced by the oxidative decarboxylation of a co-substrate (2-oxoglutarate) in a two-electron process. Another two-electron reaction follows in the second half of the catalytic cycle in which the oxidising iron species reacts with the penicillin substrate to give the corresponding cephalosporin product and water. This route of controlled ferryl formation and reaction is common to the family of 2-oxoacid-dependent ferrous enzymes.7 The structure of DAOCS was the first from this family of enzymes to be determined.3 Structures for several other members of this family have now been obtained, including clavaminate synthase,8 anthocyanidine synthase,9 proline-3hydroxylase,10 taurine/a-ketoglutarate dioxygenase,11 and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) asparaginyl hydroxylase.12­14 These structures show a common b-barrel core with the ferrous iron ligated by two histidine residues and a carboxylate group.1,3,15,16 This leaves three free ligation sites around the iron to bind a variety of reactants simultaneously. As a consequence, mononuclear ferrous enzymes can perform a significantly wider range of reactions than haem enzymes where only a single site is available to bind a single reactant at a time. A detailed characterisation and understanding of the chemistry and enzymology of mononuclear ferrous enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics could help us to derive new types of antibiotics, to prolong the lifetime of existing antibiotics, and to make new antibiotic families that are therapeutically viable, but whose current use is prohibited or limited by production costs. The original crystal structure of DAOCS3,17,18 was solved from merohedrally twinned crystals (here named form I crystals; space group R3). These ° crystals diffracted X-rays to better than 1.3 A resolution. Merohedral twinning is a packing anomaly17­19 that in the past has prevented many a structure determination. In the twinned crystals, a trimer is formed by the interpenetration of the C-terminal arm (residues 308­311) of one monomer

into the active site of the neighbouring molecule in a cyclic fashion. Dynamic light-scattering studies on the wild-type apo-enzyme in solution20 revealed that there is an equilibrium between monomers and trimers. Due to the higher relative stability of the trimeric structure at high protein concentrations, it was the trimeric form that crystallised. The trimeric arrangement fixes the C-terminal arm and partially hinders access to the active site. This complicates the soaking of substrates and other ligands into these crystals. In particular, the larger penicillin substrates can only gain access to the active site with difficulty. It took many years to work out protocols for obtaining crystal structures for DAOCS in complex with its penicillin substrates and cephalosporin products.4 The structural studies included de-twinning of each data set,3,4,17,18 a procedure that amplifies errors. Despite persistent trials no other crystal form has been obtained so far. Truncation of the C terminus is an obvious approach to prevent trimer formation. However, this operation results either in an inactive enzyme, or else in an enzyme that crystallises in the same way as the wild-type21. Structural data on IPNS22 and DAOCS4 together with mutagenesis studies on DAOCS23­26 and the bifunctional deacetoxycephalosporin/deacetylcephalosporin C synthase (DAOC/DACS)27 indicate the C-terminal arm may play some role in catalysis. For all of these reasons, a question that needs to be addressed is the general relevance of structures derived from the form I crystals. Over the past few years we performed a wide search for new crystallisation conditions and modification to the protein that would break trimer formation and abolish twinning. Here, we describe structural results from a novel crystal form (named form II) of DAOCS in which the C-terminal arm is free, and which shows no signs of merohedral twinning. These crystals are obtained from DAOCS with an N-terminal His-tag. The new structures underpin and refine earlier suggestions on productive substrate binding.4 Comparison of the active site structure of the protein in the two crystal forms indicates the possibility of an additional and unexpected role for DAOCS in the post-synthetic modification of peptides and proteins.

Results and Discussion
In the present work, DAOCS was modified by attaching a His-tag to its N-terminal Met1 residue. This is a fairly mild form of modification widely used to simplify protein purification, and was chosen to break the trimer formation observed in the apo form of the wild-type enzyme (the underlying structural considerations are discussed below). The modified protein crystallised in a new space group (P3121), and was used to obtain structural data on complexes with ferrous iron, substrates and the cephalosporin product. The Nterminal His-tag greatly simplified the purification

Figure 1. Key steps in the biosynthesis of penicillins and cephalosporins. IPNS creates from the linear tripeptide L-d-(aaminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) the bicyclic core of the penicillins in a desaturative ring closure with concomitant reduction of dioxygen. This reaction creates isopenicillin N, which is then converted to penicillin N by epimerisation at the side-chain. DAOCS expands the five-membered thiazolidine ring of the penicillin nucleus into the six-membered dihydrothiazine ring of the cephalosporin nucleus. The physiological substrate of DAOCS is penicillin N (side-chainZD-d-(a-aminoadipoyl)-) and the product is deacetoxycephalosporin C (DAOC). DAOCS has broad substrate specificity and can catalyse the ring expansion in penicillins with various side-chains. Here, we used ampicillin (sidechainZR-(2-amino)phenylacetyl-; product: cephalexin) and penicillin G (side-chainZphenylacetyl-; product: phenylacetyl-7-aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid) as substrates.

of the protein compared to previously described procedures.20 Mononuclear ferrous enzymes are oxygen-sensitive and degrade under aerobic conditions.28 With the new expression system, the time for purification was considerably shortened, which minimised exposure to oxygen, and resulted in less degradation of the protein. The yield was around 10 mg of pure crystallisation grade DAOCS from 1.5 litres of culture.

Oligomeric state of the modified protein Gel-filtration analysis performed at 8 8C indicated that in solution the labelled enzyme exists solely as a monomer. This result is strengthened by dynamic laser light-scattering measurements on the purified apo-enzyme showing the His-tagged DAOCS to be monomeric in solution between 4 8C and 24 8C. This is in sharp contrast to the behaviour of the

160 unmodified apo-enzyme.20 The trimeric structure observed earlier in the apo-enzyme3,20 is stabilised by the C-terminal arm (residue 308­311) of one molecule, which interacts with the active site of the next molecule in a cyclic fashion. Addition of Fe(II) to native apo-DAOCS shifts the equilibrium towards the monomeric form, indicating that this is the catalytically competent species of DAOCS.20 The present results on DAOCS labelled with an Nterminal His-tag show no signs of trimer formation, and the labelled DAOCS is a monomer in solution even in its iron-free form. Kinetic studies of His-tagged DAOCS using penicillin G DAOCS has broad substrate specificity and can catalyse the expansion of various penicillins with a variable efficiency.4,20,29 In earlier mutagenesis studies, penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) was used to test the activity of mutants.21,23,24,30,31 The same substrate was used in the present studies. The results show (Figure 2 and Table 1) that DAOCS with an N-terminal His-tag is active, and can expand penicillin G to the corresponding cephem. Kinetic measurements were performed in a spectrophotometric assay as described.29 The steady-state rates exhibited simple saturation kinetics (Figure 2), giving an apparent Km value for penicillin G of 20.6 mM at a fixed concentration of 2-oxoglutarate of 100 mM (Table 1). This is more than 20 times higher than that of wild-type DAOCS29 for which a Km value of 0.89 mM was measured. The kcat value for the tagged DAOCS was 0.056 sK1, which is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (0.079 sK1). These results indicate that the His-tag affects substrate binding but not the rate of the turnover. The N-terminal tag is disordered and not visible in the structure. However, judging from the fact that Met1 is located on the surface, far away from the active site, the effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme must be indirect. Structure of the His-tagged enzyme in the new crystal form Crystals were grown with ammonium sulphate as precipitant and appeared after a few days as hexagonal rods (see Materials and Methods). These ° crystals diffract X-rays to 2.3 A resolution, and belong to space group P3121 with unit cell dimen° ° sions of aZbZ138.0 A, cZ48.4 A (aZbZ90.08, gZ 120.08). The asymmetric unit contains one molecule ° (VMZ4.1 A3/Da), corresponding to a solvent content of 70% (v/v) in the crystal. Judged by their standard probability distribution of intensities32 the new form II crystals were not twinned. Form II crystals grow without the addition of 2-oxoglutarate (the co-substrate was a necessary additive to obtain crystals from the wild-type enzyme3). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of form I DAOCS as a search model. One clear solution was found with a

correlation coefficient of 0.49 and an R factor of 46%. The structure was refined to an R factor of 20% and a free R factor of 22% (Table 2). The packing of molecules in the two crystal forms differs considerably (Figure 3). In the new form II crystals, the packing is loose with big channels of solvent running through the crystal. The high solvent content of 70% (compared to ca 40% in form I crystals) allows for substantial flexibility in the lattice. The Wilson B factor of the protein is ° 62 A2 in this structure. The high solvent content and loose packing result in fragile crystals that are difficult to handle and could also explain the ° reduced diffraction limits of these crystals (2.3 A ° compared to 1.3 A resolution in the form I crystals). As expected, the overall fold of the protein is the same in the two crystals forms, and shows a b-barrel core with flanking helices. Two loops, comprising residues 82­96 and 167­177, are disordered. These two loops are also disordered in the twinned form I crystal. However, a further loop (residues 249­252) becomes ordered in form II, while this loop is disordered in some of the form I structures. A superposition of the Ca atoms (Figure 4) with a ° cut-off of 3.8 A gave a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) ° deviation of 1.1 A for the two structures. This leaves 15­20 residue positions unaccounted for, as they lie ° ° outside the 3.8 A cut-off limit. A cut-off of 6 A was required to include all residue positions in the ° comparison, and gave an r.m.s. deviation of 1.5 A between the two structures. A detailed comparison of the two crystal structures indicates significant differences in the Cterminal region (Figure 4). Starting from residue 268, the Ca atoms of the two structures deviate significantly with substantial re-orientation of the main chain (and changes of side-chain rotamers). Analysis of the two structures33 indicates the presence of two domains, comprising residues 1­ 267, and 268­299. The C-terminal domain (residues 268­299) is rotated by 15.98 towards the active site on a hinge consisting of Pro267 and Asn268 (Figure 4). Most importantly, the C-terminal arm (residues 308­311) is no longer fixed in the active site of the neighbouring molecule. There is no electron density for the last 12 residues, which protrude into the solvent, and these have not been modelled in the form II structure. There is no density for the Nterminal His-tag either; the electron density starts with Met1, while the tag protrudes into the solvent. The observed differences in the C-terminal region indicate that this part of the enzyme is mobile and can take up different conformations. Two mutations

Conformational Flexibility in DAOCS

161 Mutational studies have also demonstrated the importance of the C-terminal region (300­311) of DAOCS for the activity of the enzyme.23­26 Residues can be added without loss of activity but the successive shortening of the C-terminal arm diminishes catalytic activity. In the related enzyme, IPNS, the side-chain of the penultimate residue, Gln330, interacts with the metal centre in the absence of substrates.1 Truncation of the C-terminal arm by six residues results in complete loss of activity in IPNS.35 Truncation at the C terminus of DAOC/DACS can significantly bias substrate selectivity towards ring expansion of deacetylcephalosporin C.27 A possible role of the C terminus of IPNS and DAOCS is to isolate reactive intermediates during catalysis.3 Unfortunately, there is no direct structural evidence for this suggestion: the C-terminal arm is disordered in all structures described here, or it is fixed in the trimer interface in the form I crystals of DAOCS. When Fe(II) is diffused into the crystal, the C terminus is disturbed and no density is seen for the last three residues.3,17 The C-terminal arm and intermolecular contacts in the two crystal forms The intermolecular contact involving the Cterminal arm is not present in the form II crystals (Figure 3). How did a modification at the N terminus (the His-tag) affect the interactions of the C terminus in DAOCS? Inspection of the packing in the two crystal forms (Figure 3) gives an explanation. In the form I crystals, the N terminus, which is on the surface of the molecule, packs against two adjacent molecules of DAOCS (one within the same trimer, the other with a neighboring trimer). If there

identified from random mutagenesis, V275I and C281Y, were found to increase the activity of DAOCS towards penicillin N and penicillin G,34 although these residues are not close to the active site. Given the conformational flexibility and as suggested by Wei et al.,34 one plausible explanation may be an indirect effect of the mutations on the conformation of the C-terminal domain.

163 Methionine 180 is situated close to the active site.20 Mutation of Met180 to Phe results in increased uncoupling of 2-oxoglutarate and penicillin conversion and in a decrease in activity.24 In the form I crystals, the side-chain of Met180 is disordered in the apo-enzyme and in the enzyme­ Fe(II) complex. However, on binding 2-oxoglutarate or penicillin it becomes ordered and interacts with the ligand. In the form II crystals, Met180 is ordered, but takes up a position different from its position in the ligand complexes of form I crystals, pointing away from the active site. This is due to a movement of the loop containing residues 178­182, which interacts with residues 207­212 from a neighbouring molecule. Complex with Fe(II) Binding of ferrous iron to the active site in the crystal produced a peak in the FoKFc map for Fe(II) at a level of 16 s, with the next peak at a s level of 4 (Figure 5(a)). The iron is ligated by His183, Asp185 ° ° ° and His243 at distances of 2.4 A, 2.0 A and 2.2 A, respectively. Two water molecules (instead of three ° in the form I structure) ligate at distances of 2.0 A ° and 2.4 A. At the position of the third solvent molecule a stronger density was apparent. Ethylene glycol, which was used as a cryo-protectant, fitted this density. Ethylene glycol ligates the iron trans to ° His243 with an iron­oxygen distance of 1.8 A. A second molecule of ethylene glycol was modelled ° (Figure 5(a)) at a distance of about 5 A from the iron. This molecule is stabilised by a hydrogen bond to Arg160. The ordered binding of cryo-protectants in proteins is commonly observed. The active site in DAOCS is poised to bind small organic molecules containing carboxyl and carbonyl groups, such as 2oxoglutarate. Inspection of the binding sites for ethylene glycol reveals that these do not overlap with the 2-oxoglutarate binding site3,17 (Figure 6(a)). Instead, one ethylene glycol molecule ligates Fe(II) trans to His243 and close to the position of Ile305 in the form I crystals. The other ethylene glycol molecule binds at the position occupied by the side-chain of Met180 in the form I crystals (Fe(II)­2-oxoglutarate complex). Superposition of this model with the complex with ampicillin (Figure 6(b)) shows that the second ethylene glycol molecule overlaps with the substrate-binding site. Binding of Fe(II) to the apo-enzyme does not result in significant conformational changes in the protein. Superposition of the models yielded an ° r.m.s. deviation of 0.4 A for all Ca atoms. Complex with Fe(II) and ampicillin Crystals were soaked with Fe(II), 2-oxoglutarate and ampicillin as described in Materials and Methods, and were frozen without a cryo-protectant to avoid interference from bound ethylene glycol (see above) on ligand binding. Weak density was observed near the iron into which ampicillin could be built. The model was refined by maximum

were additional residues attached to the N terminus, the interaction would be disrupted thus interrupting trimer formation and preventing the contact with the C terminus (Figure 3). Indeed, the protein extended with a His-tag on the N terminus crystallised in a new crystal form in which both the N and the C-terminal arms protrude into the solvent. In summary, extension of the protein at the N terminus disrupted trimer formation, and liberated the unmodified C-terminal arm. A function for the inter-molecular contact and the resulting trimer interaction in the apo-form of the wild-type enzyme is yet to be found. Most 2oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases are unstable28 and easily degrade, also under catalytic conditions. In the apo-enzyme, the flexible Cterminal arm may be exposed to proteolytic cleavage (it contains arginyl and lysyl residues). A role of trimer formation in the resting unliganded enzyme may thus be to shield the C terminus and protect it from proteolytic attack.3,20 The active site in the apo-enzyme A comparison between the two crystal structures shows that many residues (including the metal ligands His183, Asp185 and His243) superimpose almost exactly. The most striking difference is the presence in the form I crystals of residues 304­306 of the C-terminal arm (of the same polypeptide chain) ° within 3.5 A from two of the metal ligands (His183 and Asp185) in the active site. The C-terminal arm is further stabilised by main-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds to residues 184­186. The Cterminal arm from the adjacent molecule also interacts with Arg160. The C-terminal arm is disordered in the form II crystals; therefore, none of these interactions is seen in the form II structure. The presence of the C-terminal arm in the active site in the form I structure affects the conformation of certain residues in the active site. Arg74 has been implicated to be important for catalysis. Mutation of Arg74 to leucine, isoleucine or glutamine abolishes completely the activity towards hydrophobic penicillins, i.e. penicillin G, ampicillin and amoxicillin,25,31 whereas these mutants show considerable activity towards penicillin N.31 In form II DAOCS, Arg74 adopts several conformations (Figure 5). In the non-liganded form of the tagged enzyme, the side-chain of Arg74 points towards the active site. When ampicillin or the product, deacetoxycephalosporin C (DAOC) binds, Arg74 swings out of the active site to give way to the ligand. This movement brings the side-chain within hydrogen bonding distance of Arg266. This position is similar to the position that the side-chain of Arg74 adopts in the form I crystals, where the side-chain swings away to avoid a collision with the C-terminal arm (residues 301­306). It appears that the importance of this residue is related to its elasticity. Bulky and hydrophobic residues in this position are unable to move as freely as arginine in order to avoid collision with the substrate.

The same density reappeared in omit maps calculated after simulated annealing with CNS.37 The cosubstrate 2-oxoglutarate was included in the soaking solution, but was not visible in the structure.

The structural results indicate flexibility in the binding of ligands in the active site. The penicillin nucleus is rotated by about 708 relative to its

position in the form I crystals and the 2-aminophenylacetyl side-chain overlaps with the position of residues 304­306 of the C-terminal arm in the form I crystals. While these are quite significant changes, the topological organisation of the molecule around the iron is similar in the two crystals. Ampicillin makes several interactions with the protein (Figures 5(b) and 6(c)). It is surrounded by Leu158, Arg160, Arg162, His183, Tyr184, Asp185, Leu186, Ile192, His243, Val245, Ser260, Val262, and ° Phe264 (all within 5 A).

165 favoured binding of the ligand and the main hydrogen bonding interactions with active site residues, albeit at a low resolution, and show a partial overlap of the binding site for the cephalosporin product in the two crystal forms. The cephalosporin product (DAOC) binds in the same pocket as ampicillin and is closely surrounded by residues Arg160, Arg162, Met180, Leu204, Val245, Ser260, Val262 and Phe264. The six-membered dihydrothiazine ring of the cephalosporin nucleus is positioned trans to Asp185. The iron­ sulphur interaction is broken in the form II crystals ° (iron­sulphur distance 5.2 A), instead, the methyl group of the dihydrothiazine ring points towards ° the iron (3.4 A). This methyl group is also within hydrophobic interaction distance from Val245 ° (3.4 A). The carboxylate of the cephalosporin nucleus makes an ionic interaction with the ° guanidinium group of Arg162 (3.3 A). The same residue also interacts with the carbonyl oxygen ° atom of the b-lactam ring (3.4 A). The side-chain of the cephalosporin in the form II crystals overlaps with the position of the C-terminal arm in the twinned form I crystals. The carbonyl oxygen atom of the a-aminoadipoyl side-chain of DAOC makes a hydrogen bond to the guanidinium group of ° Arg160 (2.9 A). In the form II crystals, the DAOC molecule is shifted from its corresponding position in the form I crystals in such a way that the sixmembered dihydrothiazine ring of the product is further away from the iron (Figure 5(c)). As a result, the b-lactam ring of the cephalosporin molecule is also shifted from the iron and forms hydrogen bonds with Arg160 and Arg162. Neither of these hydrogen bonds is seen in the structure of the twinned crystals. Mechanistic implications DAOCS performs a two-electron oxidation of the penicillin substrate for each molecule of dioxygen consumed. The other two electrons are used up in the oxidative decarboxylation of the co-substrate, 2oxoglutarate. The present results confirm that the binding sites of 2-oxoglutarate and penicillin overlap in DAOCS, and these two ligands cannot bind simultaneously to these sites in the protein. The first hydrogen atom (electron and proton) to be removed from the penicillin substrate by ironbound oxygen during catalysis comes from the b-methyl group;5,6 and is corroborated by the present structure. Transfer of the second hydrogen atom from the C3 carbon of the thiazolidine ring to the ferryl oxygen atom is more difficult to imagine. The expected position of the ferryl oxygen atom is too far away from this hydrogen atom for direct hydrogen transfer. There is no base present in the protein structure within the vicinity of this hydrogen. In neither of the two crystal forms can the Cterminal arm access the requisite side of the penicillin molecule. We speculate that electron transfer to the iron could be followed by a proton migration towards the oxygen on the iron. Transfer

group of the thiazolidine ring makes a watermediated hydrogen bond to Ser260 and a direct hydrogen bond to the guanidino group of Arg162 ° (2.9 A). The carbonyl oxygen atom on the b-lactam ° ring interacts with the side-chain of Arg160 (3.4 A). In form I crystals, in contrast, the C-terminal arm forces the ampicillin side-chain to swing towards Arg160 and this results in the disorder of the arginine side-chain. Mutation of Arg160 or Arg162 to glutamine diminishes activity,31 and illustrates the importance of these residues. In the form II structure, both residues interact with the substrate (see above) and hold it firmly. In the light of the results presented here, it seems likely that the difference in substrate binding observed in the form I crystals is caused by crystal packing. The unusually mobile C terminus may be locked in its position by the C terminus of an adjacent molecule in the trimer, thereby interfering with the substratebinding site. It is also likely that this mobility of the C terminus may have other consequences for binding and catalysis (see below). In the form II structure presented here, the thiazolidine ring ligates to the iron via its sulphur ° atom (iron­sulphur distance 2.0 A) trans to His243. One solvent molecule is also visible on the iron at a ° distance of about 2 A trans to Asp185. The a-methyl group on the thiazolidine ring makes hydrophobic ° interactions with the side-chain of Val245 (3.3 A ° away distance), and the b-methyl group sits 3.8 A from the side-chain of Val262. The first hydrogen atom (electron and proton) to be removed by the iron-bound oxygen during catalysis comes from the b-methyl group.5,6 The distance between the iron ° and the b-methyl group is 3.9 A in the form II ° crystals and 2.9 A in the form I crystals, and the b° methyl group comes within 3 A of the expected position of a ferryl oxygen atom in the form II crystals. Structure of the complex with Fe(II) and the cephalosporin product The product complex was prepared by soaking crystals of the apo-enzyme with Fe(II) and the product DAOC (but not the co-product succinate). The need to exclude cryo-protectants during freezing reduces the diffraction limit of the ligand° soaked crystals to 2.7­3.0 A resolution. Although the determination of the orientation of the ligand is not as precise at this resolution, the structure gives information on the overall orientation of the product and on its interactions with the active site. A superposition of the DAOCS­Fe(II)­DAOC and the DAOCS­Fe(II) complex gave an r.m.s. ° ° deviation of 0.58 A for all Ca using a cut-off of 3.8 A. Weak density was observed close to the iron after the soaking of Fe(II) and the product DAOC into crystals of the apo-enzyme. DAOC was modelled into this density and refined by maximum likelihood and simulated annealing techniques,36,37 with the occupancy set to 0.75. Omit maps returned the same density. The results clearly indicate the

of the electron to the iron may happen in an "indirect Pummerer" reaction4 via the sulphur atom of the penicillin nucleus bound to the iron. This could be followed by the migration of a proton to the ferryl oxygen from the C3 carbon atom. Comparison of the structures of the ES and EP complexes in the two different crystal forms of DAOCS indicates significant plasticity in ligand binding at the active site. Mononuclear ferrous enzymes are known to have broad specificities and to catalyse a range of different reactions with varying efficiency. For instance, clavaminic acid synthase8 is involved in the biosynthesis of the most important b-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid,

and it catalyses three different steps within the biosynthetic pathway, involving hydroxylation, oxidative cyclisation, and desaturation reactions. In the case of DAOCS, it is known that the enzyme can expand the nucleus of various penicillins.5,29 DAOCS and its related enzymes can also perform hydroxylation and desaturation reactions.38 Deacetylcephalosporin C synthase (DACS) catalyses the hydroxylation of DAOC following ring expansion in prokaryotes,39,40 while DAOC/DACS is a bifunctional enzyme which catalyzes both the expansion and hydroxylation reactions in the eukaryote Cephalosporium acremonium.41 Structures described here hint to a potentially

168 new item in the catalytic repertoire of DAOCS. Comparison of the C-terminal structure in form I with substrate binding in the two crystals suggests the enzyme is capable of binding long stretches of polypeptide chains in its active site (Figure 7), and that the bound polypeptide chain can be positioned so as to interact with the iron. We note that prolyl hydroxylase and the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase12­14 are 2-oxoglutarate-dependent ferrous enzymes related to DAOCS. This encouraged us to compare the crystal structures of DAOCS and complexes of the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase with fragments of the C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD).13 These analyses show that the binding site of the CAD fragments partially overlap with the position of the C terminus of DAOCS (data not shown). We speculate that an additional activity of DAOCS may be to perform post-synthetic modifications on peptides/proteins in Streptomyces clavuligerus. This possibility will need to be checked experimentally. The structural requirements for such reactions are present in the active site.

Conformational Flexibility in DAOCS

Determination of oligomeric state by gel-filtration and dynamic laser light-scattering The oligomeric state of His-tagged DAOCS was determined using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4) and 500 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/minute. The column was calibrated with chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa) and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). Dynamic laser light-scattering measurements were performed in a DynaPro-801 TC instrument at 4­20 8C on His-tagged DAOCS (1 mg/ml) in 10 mM Hepes­ NaOH (pH 7). Spectrophotometric assay of DAOCS with penicillin G A spectrophotometric assay was used to check the activity and determine the kinetic constants of tagged DAOCS.29 The enzyme was first treated with clavulanic acid (50 mM) at 30 8C for an hour to inactivate traces of TEM b-lactamase originating from the resistance selection marker. After this treatment, no residual b-lactamase activity was detected. UV spectrophotometric measurements were made in 0.2 or 1 cm light-path cuvettes using a Beckman DU8 instrument interfaced with a computer for data collection. The assay solution was made by dilution of stock solutions of buffers, cofactors, and other components to their final concentrations: 50 mM Hepes­ NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM Tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 100 mM ascorbate and 100 mM 2-oxoglutarate. The penicillin G concentration varied from 2 mM to 30 mM. A total of 3 ml of the mixture at each penicillin G concentration was made and kept on ice. Before assaying, a small volume of concentrated ferrous ammonium sulphate solution was added to a final concentration of 50 mM. The mixture was incubated at 30 8C, samples of 400 ml were withdrawn and the reactions were started by rapidly mixing with concentrated DAOCS (around 8 mM final concentration). The absorbance at 260 nm was monitored and during the measurement the temperature was maintained at 30 8C by a Peltier system. A blank assay with no enzyme was recorded in a similar fashion, and if significant deviation from linearity in absorbance was observed in this blank assay, the values obtained in the presence of enzyme were corrected accordingly. Rate values were obtained from at least five independent measurements and two blank assays for each concentration of penicillin G tested. Two sets of measurements were performed at the concentrations of 5 mM, and 20 mM of substrate. These are plotted as separate points in Figure 2. The steady-state kinetic parameters were obtained by a non-linear regression fit of the data to the Henri­Michaelis model. Crystallisation and data collection Crystals of DAOCS with an N-terminal His-tag were grown by vapour-diffusion using the hanging-drop method at 4 8C. The precipitating solution consisted of 100 mM Hepes­NaOH (pH 8.0), and 0.9­1.1 M (NH4)2SO4. To slow the evaporation, 150 ml of oil (Al's oil; Hampton Research) was layered over the reservoir solution. For data collection at cryogenic temperatures the crystals were transferred to a solution of 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol in 0.9­1.1 M (NH4)2SO4, 100 mM Hepes­ NaOH (pH 8.0) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ligand complexes were prepared by soaking crystals of the apo-enzyme at 20 8C for 10­30 minutes in artificial mother liquor solutions containing (i) 20 mM Fe(II), (ii)

Materials and Methods
Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck unless otherwise specified and were of analytical grade or higher.

Expression and purification The plasmid of DAOCS from S. clavuligerus was subcloned into pET-15b with an N-terminal 6x-histidine tag (sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH-). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. E. coli cultures of one to two litres in LB medium (supplemented with 100 mg/ml of ampicillin) were grown at 30 8C with vigorous shaking until A600 nmZ w1. The cultures were then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and left to grow for another two hours. The cells were centrifuged at 5000g for 15 minutes at 4 8C. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 40 ml of 20 mM NaH2 PO4 (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. An EDTA-free protease-inhibitor cocktail tablet (Complete, Roche) was added and the solution was stirred for 15 minutes. Total cell disruption was achieved by sonication and the lysate was centrifuged at 14, 000g for 40 minutes at 4 8C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 10 ml column (Amersham Biosciences) packed with Ni-NTA superflow (QIAGEN) and equilibrated using lysis buffer. The protein was eluted with a gradient of 2%­100% 250 mM imidazole in lysis buffer over 85 ml in total. Protein fractions eluting at 15%­50% (v/v) imidazole were pooled and concentrated in a 50 ml Amicon stirred cell (Millipore filters; 10 kDa cut-off), and run on a 24 ml Superdex75 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT. The column was eluted with the same buffer and fractions were pooled and concentrated to 25 mg/ml (Centricon concentrators, 10 kDa cut-off). The buffer was changed to 10 mM Hepes­NaOH (pH 7), and the protein was stored frozen at K80 8C.

20 mM Fe(II), 33 mM 2-oxoglutarate and 88 mM ampicillin, or (iii) 20 mM Fe(II) and 150 mM DAOC. The complexes were prepared under strictly anaerobic conditions (0.1 ppm oxygen) and the crystals were flashfrozen inside the anaerobic box. Crystals containing substrate or product were frozen without the use of cryo-protectant. This precaution was taken, since ethylene glycol was found to bind to Fe(II) in the DAOCS­ Fe(II) crystals. X-ray data were collected at 100 K on beam-lines ID14 EH1/EH3 and ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) and were indexed, integrated and scaled using the HKL program suite.42 Structure determination and model building The structure was solved with the molecular replacement program EPMR43 using the coordinates from native DAOCS3 (PDB entry 1dcs) as a search model. After an initial run of rigid body refinement in REFMAC,32,36 with residues 300­311 removed from the model, the structure was refined using a combination of maximum likelihood refinement in REFMAC, and simulated annealing refinement with energy minimisation in CNS.37 Five percent of the data were set aside for calculations of a free R factor, and the same test set was maintained in all data sets throughout refinement. Electron density maps were inspected and further interpreted with the program O.44 Manual rebuilding using O was done for the C-terminal part of the protein, from residue 270 and onwards. Initial models for the ligand complexes were obtained by rigid body refinement in REFMAC using the structure of Histagged apo-enzyme or DAOCS­Fe(II) and were then further refined with REFMAC and CNS as described above. The iron­ligand bond lengths were unrestrained throughout the refinement. Restraints for ampicillin and DAOC were calculated from models obtained by energy minimization. Quality checks using PROCHECK32,45 showed good geometry and good agreement between model and data. All residues are within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, with Cys155 (in the native structure) in the generously allowed region. Coordinates were superimposed using O and calculations of r.m.s. deviations of Ca atoms between the two ° structures were performed with cut-offs of 3.8 A and ° 6 A. Figures were prepared using the programs Molray,46 MOLSCRIPT,47,48 Raster3D,49 and PyMOL.
