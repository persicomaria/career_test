The lymphocyte-specific kinase (Lck), a member of the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is expressed in T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Genetic evidence, including knockout mice and human mutations, demonstrates that Lck kinase activity is critical for normal T cell development, activation, and signaling. Selective inhibition of Lck is expected to offer a new therapy for the treatment of T-cell-mediated autoimmune and inflammatory disease. With the aid of X-ray structure-based analysis, aminopyrimidine amides 2 and 3 were designed from aminoquinazolines 1, which had previously been demonstrated to exhibit potent inhibition of Lck and T cell proliferation. In this report, we describe the synthesis and structure­activity relationships of a series of novel aminopyrimidine amides 3 possessing improved cellular potency and selectivity profiles relative to their aminoquinazoline predecessors 1. Orally bioavailable compound 13b inhibited the anti-CD3-induced production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in mice in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 ) 9.4 mg/kg).
Introduction Signal transduction pathways mediated by the T cell receptor (TCRa) have been extensively researched.1 Novel immunosuppressive agents that target components of these pathways may be useful as therapies for T-cell-mediated inflammatory or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, polyarthritis scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, Sjogren's disease, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, and lupus. Such therapies could also prove advantageous in transplant organ or graft rejection.2 The Src family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases includes Src, Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Hck, Fgr, Blk, and Yes.3 Lck and Fyn have been shown to have important roles in TCR-mediated signal transduction.4 TCR signals propagated by the stimulation of Lck ultimately lead to gene regulation events triggering cytokine release, proliferation, and survival of antigen specific T cells, thereby amplifying immune responses. Defects in T cell maturation and signaling, which affect expression and/or

catalytic activity, have been observed in Lck knockout mice and humans with Lck mutations.5 These findings suggest that a small-molecule inhibitor of Lck activity could prove useful as an immunosuppressive agent. In recent years, we and others have disclosed several classes of small-molecule Lck inhibitors.6 Some of these agents have demonstrated oral bioavailability and inhibitory activities in rodent models of T-cell-dependent immune responses.1,6d­f,i­p 2-Aminoquinazolines 1 (-L- ) -CONH-, -NHCO-, or -NHCONH-) were identified via high-throughput screening of our kinase-preferred compound collection as potent, ATPcompetitive inhibitors of Lck.6p Compounds with general structure 1 also exhibited potent inhibitory activity against T-cell proliferation and activation as measured by the human mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and the T cell receptor/anti-CD3induced production of interleukin-2 (IL-2). Extensive medicinal chemistry efforts were invested toward understanding the SAR of the 2-aminoquinazolines. These efforts led to the identification of orally bioavailable compounds with inhibitory activity in the anti-CD3-induced model of IL-2 production in mice and moderate to good selectivity profiles. Analysis of several X-ray cocrystal structures of aminoquinazolines 1 and Lck revealed key H-bonding interactions in the ATP-binding site, which are depicted in Figure 1. We sought to improve the selectivity of our aminoquinazoline series by taking advantage of the sequence differences among structurally related kinases in and around the ATP-binding pocket (Table 1). Specifically, we targeted structural modifications that would allow for an additional H-bonding interaction with the threonine gatekeeper residue (T316) in Lck. We hypothesized that such a new interaction would increase selectivity over kinases with non-threonine

amides. Similarly, aminopyrimidine amide ureas (3, -L- ) -NHCONH-, i.e., 23a,b) were prepared from 12 via reduction of the nitro group and reaction of the derived aniline with isocyanates. These synthetic routes proved to be quite general such that a variety of reverse amides and ureas could be prepared in moderate to good overall yields. In some instances, unsubstituted 2-aminopyrimidine nitrobenzamide 12a was converted to iodide 24 via a Sandmeyer reaction (Scheme 2).10 SNAr reactions of iodide 24 were accomplished under thermal, basic conditions with alkylamines (i.e., 13e) or under thermal, acidic conditions with anilines. The nitrobenzamide products were then reduced to the corresponding anilines and coupled to acids or acid chlorides to generate the final compounds. Variations on the central aryl ring were typically introduced early in the synthetic route beginning with appropriately functionalized, commercially available benzoic acids (i.e., 25, 26, 30). Final compounds were thus prepared following standard procedures, as depicted in Scheme 2.

Results and Discussion Structure­Activity Relationships (SAR). To test our hypothesis that the introduction of an H-bond donor moiety would confer enhanced selectivity over kinases that possess a gatekeeper residue other than threonine, we investigated a series of direct 2-aminopyrimidine amide analogues of our nonselective 2-aminoquinazoline leads (Table 2). Replacement of the 2-aminoquinazoline with a 2-aminopyrimidine amide leads to a 10to 75-fold loss of potency on Lck, as evidenced by comparison of the in vitro profiles for representative amides (34 vs 10a), reverse amides (35 vs 13a), and ureas (36 vs 23a). The potency loss is counteracted by the introduction of a 4-(4-methylpiperazino)anilino substituent at the 2-position in the pyrimidine series (10b, 13b, 23b). We speculate that this gain in enzyme potency results from additional stabilizing van der Waals interactions between the aryl ring of the aniline substituent and the two lipophilic residues (Leu251 of the glycine-rich loop and Gly332) between which it is situated.9 Interestingly, reverse amide 13b demonstrated greater selectivity than amide 10b and greater cellular potency than urea 23b. Unfortunately, the arylpiperazine 13b does not afford a substantial improvement in selectivity over KDR relative to aminoquinazoline 35 (40fold vs 15-fold). In KDR, the valine gatekeeper residue is relatively small and can presumably tolerate a proximal hydrophilic amide moiety. X-ray crystallography was used to confirm our hypothesis that a 2-aminopyrimidine amide binds to Lck in a manner similar to that observed for the 2-aminoquinazoline but also engages the threonine gatekeeper in an H-bonding interaction (between the amide NH and the oxygen of T316). The cocrystal structures of Lck and aminopyrimidine amide 10b (Figure 2a) and Lck and aminopyrimidine reverse amide 19 (Figure 2b) were solved at 2.2 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively. In both structures, the inhibitor occupies the ATP-binding site and induces the protein to assume a DFG-out conformation.11 The aminopyrimidine ring makes two hydrogen bond contacts to the hinge region of the enzyme at M319 (10b, 3.04 and 2.78 Å; 19, 2.99 and 2.89 Å). As hypothesized, the pyrimidine amide moiety engages the gatekeeper residue (T316) in an H-bond interaction (10b, 3.07 Å; 19, 3.11 Å), acting as an H-bond donor to the threonine oxygen. The arylamide moiety makes hydrogen bond contacts with the backbone NH of D382 (10b, 2.89 Å; 19, 2.97 Å) from the DFG sequence and E288 (10b, 2.80 Å; 19, 2.99 Å) from the C-helix. The aryl ring of the second amide thus occupies the extended hydrophobic pocket, making van der

gatekeeper residues (namely, Tie-2, Jak3, and KDR).7 Support for this hypothesis is provided by imatinib, which selectively inhibits a subset of kinases (BCR-Abl, cKit, PDGFR) through preferential binding to the inactive (DFG-out) conformation of the protein and hydrogen bonding to the threonine gatekeeper residue.8 Furthermore, a single point mutation at the Abl gatekeeper residue (T315I) results in resistance to imatinib. Toward this end, we designed aminopyrimidine amides with general structures 29 and 3. Herein, we describe synthesis, X-ray structure, structure­activity relationships, and pharmacological characterization of aminopyrimidine amides 3 and the identification of an orally bioavailable Lck inhibitor (13b) with dosedependent efficacy in a mouse model of T-cell receptor stimulated IL-2 production. Chemistry Aminopyrimidine amides (3, -L- ) -CONH-, i.e., 10a,b) were prepared as depicted in Scheme 1. 2,5-Diaminopyrimidines 6 were prepared from 2-amino-5-nitropyrimidines 5, which were either commercially available (5a, R1 ) H) or derived from the SNAr reaction of 2-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine (4) and anilines (i.e., 6b, R1 ) 4-(4-methylpiperizino)aniline) or amines (i.e., 6c,d). Commercially available 3-iodo-4-methylbenzoyl chloride (7) was condensed with 3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline in the presence of triethylamine to provide iodoamide 8, which was then subjected to palladium-catalyzed carbonylative esterification and subsequent saponification to afford acid 9. Condensation of 9 with 2,5-diaminopyrimidines 6a,b provided the final compounds 10a,b. The synthesis of aminopyrimidine reverse amides (3, -L- ) -NHCO-, i.e., 13a-d, 14­22) was also accomplished in a convergent manner (Scheme 1). Nitrobenzamides 12, prepared by the reaction of 2,5-diaminopyrimidines 6 and acid chlorides, were reduced to the corresponding anilines and selectively coupled to acids or acid chlorides to generate reverse

Waals contacts to several lipophilic residues. This type of DFGout binding mode was previously observed for the parent 2-aminoquinazolines and is not observed for most other reported Src-family kinase inhibitors such as PP1 and PP2.12 In view of the marked similarity in binding mode between amides and reverse amides with Lck, we are currently unable to offer a rational explanation for the superior selectivity of 13b relative to 10b. Similarities in the binding modes of aminopyrimidine amides and quinazolines are demonstrated by the overlay of two cocrystal structures with Lck (Figure 2c). As observed in the cocrystal structures, substituents on the 2-amino group of the pyrimidine can extend to the solvent front and may be engaged in additional binding interactions with residues lining the hinge region and the glycine-rich loop.13,6s,9 In light of the gain in potency observed for 13b relative to 13a and the potential for additional H-bonding6s or van der Waals9 interactions with residues lining the hinge region, we

examined the effect on potency and selectivity of smaller tertiary amine containing chains to the 2-position of the pyrimidine (Table 3, 13c-e). Although these analogues proved quite selective over KDR, Tie-2, and Jak3, their Lck kinase and cellular potency was significantly less than 13b. As anticipated, the H-bond donor to the hinge is important for potency; a substantial loss in potency was also observed with the unsubstituted pyrimidine 37. Selected SAR from variations on the arylamide is summarized in Table 4. Moderate potency and good selectivity (vs KDR, Tie-2, and Jak3) was observed with isoxazole 15, benzamide 16, and 2-methoxybenzamide 17. These three analogues possessed kinase selectivity profiles comparable to that of lead 13b but were less potent. Compounds lacking the southern aryl ring, such as acetamide 14, were also significantly (>50-fold) less potent than 13b on Lck. Exceptional enzyme and cellular potency, comparable to that of lead 13b, was consistently observed for meta-

or para-substituted derivatives, such as 18­22. Of these, 20 proved most selective over KDR (>200-fold). An examination of the central aryl ring situated in the classical hydrophobic pocket led to compounds with significantly improved selectivity profiles (Table 5). On the basis of SAR from the parent aminoquinazoline series, we surmised that a small lipophilic substituent such as methyl or chloro at R1 was important for cellular potency. We also discovered that the larger ethyl substituent was tolerated with only a moderate (2- to 5-fold) loss of Lck potency and afforded excellent selectivity over p38R (i.e., 33). Small substituents at R2, such as methyl or chloro, were also better tolerated by Lck than by p38R (29 and 27). Unfortunately, none of these more selective analogues demonstrated acceptable cellular potency. The narrow SAR is consistent with expectations, given the lack of space in this region of the binding site (see X-ray structures, Figure 2).6p,14 On account of their in vitro potencies and selectivity profiles, selected aminopyrimidine amides were advanced into our secondary cellular screening assay, which measures the compound's inhibitory effect on the anti-CD3 induced production

of IL-2 in 50% human whole-blood (WB IL-2) (Table 6). Compounds 13b, 18-20, and 22 were very potent inhibitors of IL-2 production in human whole blood. On the basis of the general inhibitory activity in the p38R kinase assay (<10 nM) for this series, three representative compounds, 13b, 18, and 19, were further counterscreened for inhibitory activity in the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNFR in 50% human whole blood (WB TNFR). The whole blood cellular selectivity factor (WB IL-2 IC50/WB TNFR IC50) was substantial for all three compounds (102-, 63-, and 685-fold, respectively). For several compounds, the protein binding profiles were examined in plasma from three species (Table 6). Pharmacokinetic Profile. Selected PK data for discrete intravenous (iv) and oral (po) dosing in male Sprague­Dawley rats are shown in Table 7. Clearance ranged from low (22, 0.29 L/h/kg) to greater than hepatic blood flow (21, 6.64 L/h/kg), and oral bioavailability was generally low (4­22%). Compound 13b exhibited a moderate rate of clearance, volume of distribution, oral exposure, and bioavailability. In light of the rat pharmacokinetic profile and the exceptional in vitro potency,

13b appeared suitable for assessment via oral dosing in our rodent model of T cell activation. Selectivity Profile. Prior to in vivo testing, compound 13b was screened for inhibitory activity against an extensive panel of kinases (Table 8).15 Excellent selectivity (>1000-fold) was observed over a number of structurally diverse kinases. As expected, 13b was not selective over other members of the Src family (Src, Fyn, Lyn), p38R, Abl, or cFMS, all of which possess a threonine gatekeeper residue. The Src-family kinases are broadly expressed in a variety of tissues with high levels in hematopoietic cells. The lack of intraSrc family selectivity remains a concern because of potential adverse effects from multikinase inhibition. In particular, Lyn knockout mice show defective BCR signaling and decreased peripheral B-cells.3,16,17 The intra-Src family specificity required for safe clinical application and/or therapeutic treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory disease remains an unknown at this time. Despite numerous reports of assorted chemotypes with varying selectivity profiles,6 a smallmolecule inhibitor of Lck has yet to demonstrate successful clinical application in autoimmune, inflammatory disease, or transplant rejection. We believe that the overall kinase selectivity profile offered by this new aminopyrimidine amide class could pave the way to the identification of tool compounds to answer such questions. Compound 13b was also tested for its ability to inhibit IL-2 production in Jurkat cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myritstyl 13-acetate (PMA) in the presence of ionophore. In this assay, the IC50 was >20 µM, which provides further evidence that the inhibition of kinases downstream of Lck is minimal. Pharmacodynamic Profile. Compound 13b was further evaluated as an inhibitor in the anti-CD3-induced IL-2 production model in female BALB/c mice (Figure 3). Upon oral administration at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, 13b exhibited statistically significant dose-dependent inhibition of IL-2 production. In this study, terminal plasma levels (at 2.5 h) of 13b were determined in order to estimate the levels of exposure at each dose. At the estimated ED50 (9.4 mg/kg) the mean terminal plasma concentration (EC50) was 175 nM. This concentration

provides 25-fold coverage over the in vitro potency in the 50% human whole-blood IL-2 assay (IC50 ) 7 nM) at 2.5 h. When adjusted for free fraction based on mouse protein binding (Table 6), the EC50 (fu) for 13b is 4 nM,18 which is consistent with the in vitro inhibitory activity in the absence of whole blood (IL-2 IC50 ) 0.6 nM). 13b demonstrates comparable in vivo efficacy to cyclosporine A (ED50 ) 10 mg/kg) in this model.6i Conclusions Aminopyrimidine amides 3, designed from aminoquinazolines 1, were demonstrated to afford improved potency and selectivity

Unless otherwise noted, all materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Quinazolines 34­36 were prepared according to previously published procedures.6p Dry organic solvents (CH2Cl2, CH3CN, DMF, etc.) were purchased from Aldrich packaged under nitrogen in Sure/ Seal bottles. Reactions were monitored using Agilent 1100 series LCMS with UV detection at 254 nm and a low resonance electrospray mode (ESI). Medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) was performed on a CombiFlash Companion (Teledyne Isco) with RediSep normal-phase silica gel (35 ­ 60 µm) columns and UV detection at 254 nm. Preparative reversed-phase HPLC was performed on a Gilson (215 liquid handler) YMC-Pack Pro C18, 150 mm × 30 mm i.d. column, eluting with a binary solvent system A and B using a gradient elution (A, H2O with 0.1% TFA; B, CH3CN with 0.1% TFA) with UV detection at 254 nm. Purity was measured using Agilent 1100 series high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems with UV detection at 254 nm (system A, Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5 µm, 5-100% CH3CN in H2O with 0.1% TFA for 15 min at 1.5 mL/min; system B, Waters Xterra 4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3.5 µm, 5-95% CH3CN in H2O with 0.1% TFA for 15 min at 1.0 mL/ min). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz) spectrometer at ambient temperature or on a Varian 400 MHz or on a Varian 300 MHz spectrometer.

for the inhibition of Lck, T cell proliferation, and T cell activation. Our hypothesis that the introduction of an amide H-bond donor moiety would provide an additional site of interaction between the ligand and the gatekeeper residue (T316) of Lck was verified by X-ray crystallographic studies. This interaction presumably contributes to the enhanced selectivity afforded by these compounds relative to the parent aminoquinazolines. Extensive SAR investigations resulted in a diverse

Purification via column chromatography on silica gel (gradient elution with 0-10% CH3OH/CH2Cl2) afforded the title compound (0.083 g, 55% yield) as an off-white amorphous solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6):  10.82 (s, 1H), 10.61 (s, 1H), 9.16 (s, 2H), 8.95 (s, 1H), 8.31 (m, 2H), 7.99 (s, 2H), 7.86 (s, 1H), 7.81 (s, 1H), 7.37 (s, 1H), 2.40 (s, 3H). HRMS (C20H16F3N4O2)+: calcd, 401.121 99; found, 401.123 99. Biological Materials and Methods. Lck Kinase Assay. The Lck HTRF kinase assay involves ATP-dependent phosphorylation of a biotinylated substrate peptide of gastrin in the presence or absence of inhibitor compound. The final concentration of gastrin was 1.2 µM. The final concentration of ATP was 0.5 µM (Km(app) ) 0.6 ( 0.1 µM), and the final concentration of Lck (a GST-kinase domain fusion (AA 225­509)) was 250 pM. Buffer conditions were as follows: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl, 5 mM MnCl, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA. The assay was quenched and stopped with 160 µL of detection reagent. Detection reagents were as follows: buffer made of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20. Prior to reading, steptavidin allophycocyanin (SA-APC) was added at a final concentration in the assay of 0.0004 mg/mL, along with europilated antiphosphotyrosine Ab (Eu-anti-PY) at a final concentration of 0.025 nM. The assay plate was read in a Discovery fluorescence plate reader with excitation at 320 nm and emission at 615 and 655 nm. Reported IC50 values are the mean of two or more separate determinations run in duplicate. Assays for other kinases were done in a similar way as described above, varying the concentrations of enzyme, peptide substrate, and ATP added to the reaction, depending on the specific activity of the kinase and measured Km values for the substrates. Human Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR). The purpose of this assay is to test the potency of T cell activation inhibitors in an in vitro model of allogeneic T cell stimulation. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hPBL, 2 × 105/well) were incubated with mitomycin C treated B lymphoblastoid cells (JY cell line (ATCC, Rockville, MD), 1 × 105/well) as allogeneic stimulators in the presence or absence of dilutions of potential inhibitor compound in 96-well round-bottom tissue culture plates. These cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 days total. The proliferative response of the hPBL was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation overnight between days 5 and 6 after initiation of culture. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters, and 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA was analyzed by liquid scintillation counter. Anti-CD3/CD28-Induced T Cell IL-2 Secretion and Proliferation Assay (IL-2). The purpose of this assay was to test the potency of T cell receptor (TCR, CD3) and CD28 signaling pathway inhibitors in human T cells. T cells were purified from human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hPBL) and preincubated with or without compound prior to stimulation with a combination of an

anti-CD3 and an anti-CD28 antibody in 96-well tissue culture plates (1 × 105 T cells/well). Cells were cultured for 20 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, then secreted IL-2 in the supernatants was quantified by cytokine ELISA (Pierce/Endogen, St. Louis, MO). The cells remaining in the wells were then pulsed with 3H-thymidine overnight to assess the T cell proliferative response. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters, and 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA was analyzed by a liquid scintillation counter. For comparison purposes, phorbol myristic acid (PMA) and calcium ionophore can be used in combination to induce IL-2 secretion from purified T cells. Potential inhibitor compounds can be tested for inhibition of this response as described above for anti-CD3 and -CD28 antibodies. Human whole-blood anti-CD3/CD28-induced IL-2 secretion assays were run in a similar fashion as described above using whole blood from normal volunteers diluted 50% in tissue culture medium prior to stimulation. Human Whole-Blood LPS-Induced TNFr. Compounds were preincubated with heparinized human whole blood diluted in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% v/v human serum AB (Gemini BioSciences) and 1% pen/strep at a final wholeblood dilution of 50% in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Falcon) for 1 h at 37 °C. LPS (List Biological Laboratories, 0.1 µg/mL Final) was subsequently added. Plates were then incubated overnight (18 h) at 37 °C. Secreted cytokines were measured by ELISA. Pharmacokinetic Studies. Male Sprague­Dawley rats were administered compound, iv as a solution in DMSO or po as a suspension in 2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose with 1% Tween80, at the indicated doses. Samples were taken at various times after dosing and were analyzed for parent compound by the LC-MS method. Anti-CD3 Induced IL-2 Production in Mice. Twelve week old (20 g) BALB/c mice were dosed 1 h prior to challenge with compound po (8 per group) at the indicated doses in 2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose with 1% Tween-80. Mice were then challenged iv with antimouse CD3 monoclonal antibody (145.2C11, BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA; 3 µg/mouse) diluted in PBS. At 90 min after anti-CD3 challenge, blood was collected via cardiac puncture. IL-2 levels were measured in serum by ELISA (BioSource, Camarillo, CA). Data points represent the mean IL-2 levels/ group ( the standard error. The p values were determined vs vehicle control by the Mann­Whitney U-test. Protein Binding Assay. An aliquot of test article (DMSO solution) was added to plasma in a well of a 96-deep well plate (Nunc, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) to make a 10 µM plasma sample. The DMSO content was 0.1%. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. After incubation aliquots of samples (two aliquots per sample) were transferred to a Millipore MultiScreen Filter Plate incorporating Ultracel-10 membrane with a 10 000 molecular weight cutoff (Millipore Co., Billerica, MA). The filter plate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 45 min at 37 °C by Swinging-Bucket Rotor (Allegra 25R, refrigerated benchtop centrifuge, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). After centrifugation, an aliquot of each filtrate was transferred and mixed with one volume of acetonitrile/water (25:75, v/v, containing 0.1% formic acid and internal standard) to create unbound samples. Another plate was created by spiking the test article (DMSO solution) to plasma filtrate to make 10 µM reference samples. Each well of the reference sample was mixed with one volume of acetonitrile/water (25:75, v/v, containing 0.1% formic acid and internal standard). Reference samples and unbound samples were analyzed by LC-MS. The peak ratio was determined from the MS response of the test article versus the MS response of the internal standard. The percent of binding was calculated as % protein binding ) [1 - (mean peak ratios of unbound)/(peak ratio of reference)] × 100.
